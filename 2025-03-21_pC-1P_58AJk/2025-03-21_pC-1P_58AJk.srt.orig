1
00:00:57,543 --> 00:01:03,248
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd like suspension of rule number 33 to take item 15-012.

2
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:15,538
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of councilor Camuso to take item number, uh, zero one, two, all those in favor, all those opposed.

3
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:21,083
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a number 15-012 offered by councilor Camuso.

4
00:01:21,604 --> 00:01:25,567
[SPEAKER_14]: Be it resolved that the Medford city council, uh, sorry, that the city of Medford,

5
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:34,045
[SPEAKER_14]: establish a long-term stabilization fund to help offset any major projects such as the police station in the future.

6
00:01:34,425 --> 00:01:35,266
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Camuso.

7
00:01:35,566 --> 00:01:36,567
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President.

8
00:01:37,007 --> 00:01:45,612
[SPEAKER_18]: As we're all aware, the city has several accounts, the overlay surplus account, the linkage account, water and sewer enterprise, certified free cash account.

9
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:53,517
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's about time that this city council asked the mayor to have an actual account in the budget.

10
00:01:55,287 --> 00:01:57,749
[SPEAKER_18]: for long-term stabilization of this community.

11
00:01:58,189 --> 00:02:13,719
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, the mayor's not going to be here forever, and we want to make sure that there is a stabilization fund in place so that in years to come, this city can be financially stabilized.

12
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:20,463
[SPEAKER_18]: In the past, I know Budget Director Burke, as a member of this council, often called for a capital improvement fund.

13
00:02:21,418 --> 00:02:30,806
[SPEAKER_18]: And I just think this is a good way where, come budget time, we could actually ask the mayor, hey, we would like to see X amount of dollars put into this actual account.

14
00:02:31,606 --> 00:02:46,418
[SPEAKER_18]: And I just think it's something that we have to do to think about the future of our children, that someday we'll be the leaders in this community, and to make sure that we set it up in a way that will be financially stable for years to come.

15
00:02:46,918 --> 00:02:48,960
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'd like to make a motion for approval.

16
00:02:49,556 --> 00:02:53,298
[SPEAKER_18]: on setting up an actual municipal city account for this purpose.

17
00:02:53,979 --> 00:02:57,040
[SPEAKER_18]: On the motion of approval by Councilor Camuso, Councilor Penta.

18
00:02:57,501 --> 00:03:03,904
[SPEAKER_05]: On that account, I agree with my colleague of having that done, but I think we've, we've been talking about this for almost a year and a half.

19
00:03:04,305 --> 00:03:16,352
[SPEAKER_05]: And I believe in the year 2014, while you were serving as president, and that was the number one priority of the Medford city council to have an account or something that would basically relegate itself toward addressing a police station.

20
00:03:16,392 --> 00:03:18,313
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we have the chief of police here tonight,

21
00:03:18,622 --> 00:03:19,723
[SPEAKER_05]: I know he would welcome that.

22
00:03:20,123 --> 00:03:24,785
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that the members of the, uh, method police department would welcome it, but it still has to come from the mayor.

23
00:03:24,885 --> 00:03:38,473
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just really wouldn't want this to be, um, some type of a, um, lip service going forward without having some kind of an agreement that money would be put aside on an annual basis or that we would put a yearly program together.

24
00:03:38,493 --> 00:03:41,875
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe by the end of the third year, the money would be there rather than waiting.

25
00:03:41,935 --> 00:03:45,877
[SPEAKER_05]: As the mayor has alluded to, it'll be seven years before, and he's not going to be here in seven years.

26
00:03:45,917 --> 00:03:47,578
[SPEAKER_05]: We all know that, you know, thank God.

27
00:03:48,045 --> 00:04:09,957
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that being said, I think maybe a redirection as to not only setting up the account, but maybe taking a dollar amount, making a request to take a dollar amount, either out of our free cash or on the stabilization account, as we did to take money out of the account of our deficit as it relates to our retirement fund.

28
00:04:10,017 --> 00:04:11,758
[SPEAKER_05]: It's in a total deficit.

29
00:04:12,038 --> 00:04:13,899
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've asked to take each on an annual basis of $500,000.

30
00:04:15,757 --> 00:04:17,298
[SPEAKER_05]: to at least start the ball rolling.

31
00:04:17,318 --> 00:04:22,641
[SPEAKER_05]: The mayor is yet to respond from that, because it's obvious that it's not on his plate to be thinking about.

32
00:04:23,341 --> 00:04:24,542
[SPEAKER_05]: And I agree with you.

33
00:04:24,562 --> 00:04:25,902
[SPEAKER_05]: I think something needs to be done.

34
00:04:25,922 --> 00:04:38,168
[SPEAKER_05]: I would rather put a dollar amount from a budgetary item in here to tell the mayor that we're serious about doing this, or your resolution is serious, rather than just making a request.

35
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:41,530
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would up the anti-jar resolution.

36
00:04:41,998 --> 00:04:48,480
[SPEAKER_05]: To pick an account, take a dollar amount that we know we have over $7 million in free cash, we could take something out of there to get the ball rolling.

37
00:04:49,281 --> 00:04:52,121
[SPEAKER_18]: I can understand where you're coming from, and I do not oppose it.

38
00:04:53,322 --> 00:04:58,684
[SPEAKER_18]: The intent of this at this point is to open the line item account so that it's an actual line item come budget time.

39
00:04:59,144 --> 00:05:07,967
[SPEAKER_18]: And then at that point, I think that would be the appropriate opportunity as we're going through the budget line by line to say, as a council, we'd like to see X amount put in there.

40
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:12,471
[SPEAKER_18]: As we know, there's many accounts throughout the city budget right now that are funded for $1.

41
00:05:13,111 --> 00:05:19,254
[SPEAKER_18]: But if you want to put a dollar amount, amend the paper to put a dollar amount in there, I would support it.

42
00:05:19,574 --> 00:05:26,938
[SPEAKER_18]: But ultimately, if the mayor decides that he's not for that dollar amount, I think we have to be reasonable here and first set up the account.

43
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:32,501
[SPEAKER_18]: And moving forward, fund it in a manner that will stabilize our community for years to come.

44
00:05:32,581 --> 00:05:34,982
[SPEAKER_18]: So if you want to put a dollar amount, I'll support it.

45
00:05:35,042 --> 00:05:36,843
[SPEAKER_18]: But if he doesn't agree with that,

46
00:05:37,605 --> 00:05:44,228
[SPEAKER_18]: I just would hate to have him say that this is the end of it, and at least a small dollar amount to get the ball rolling.

47
00:05:44,248 --> 00:05:53,493
[SPEAKER_18]: Because if we do this every year, or if he appropriates the money throughout the year, too, at the end of the year, oftentimes, we're transferring money around.

48
00:05:53,513 --> 00:05:58,055
[SPEAKER_18]: I would like to see it going to a stabilization fund rather than the free cash account.

49
00:05:58,555 --> 00:06:02,137
[SPEAKER_18]: Because ultimately, big projects like the police station are going to be bonded.

50
00:06:02,537 --> 00:06:07,019
[SPEAKER_18]: And if we can have money in an account for that specific purpose, and I have to be clear,

51
00:06:07,437 --> 00:06:10,659
[SPEAKER_18]: This is not for the new police station and the new police station only.

52
00:06:11,099 --> 00:06:16,763
[SPEAKER_18]: This is for the stabilization of our community for major projects like the police station, like other things that may come up.

53
00:06:17,123 --> 00:06:21,106
[SPEAKER_18]: So I just don't want to be misleading to the community like you had mentioned, Councilor.

54
00:06:21,126 --> 00:06:23,047
[SPEAKER_18]: So if you want to put a dollar amount, I'll support it.

55
00:06:23,927 --> 00:06:26,009
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no problem putting a dollar amount in there.

56
00:06:26,849 --> 00:06:27,650
[SPEAKER_05]: We have other buildings.

57
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:30,492
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we can just look at that building right up here in City Hall.

58
00:06:30,532 --> 00:06:32,313
[SPEAKER_05]: This has been going on for well over two years.

59
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:37,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Now what they did is they've covered the hole in the ceiling rather than fix the hole in the ceiling.

60
00:06:37,824 --> 00:06:40,826
[SPEAKER_05]: And as part of the frame that goes around, it's still ready.

61
00:06:41,506 --> 00:06:43,047
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know whether it's going to come down or not.

62
00:06:43,087 --> 00:06:49,730
[SPEAKER_05]: We can go to the public library, and we can look at the public library and look at the thousands of dollars that's needed over there in the public library.

63
00:06:50,091 --> 00:06:58,175
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Caviello, when he first came on, I think it was on his 11th month, he gave us a paper that had $1.2 million worth of needed repairs.

64
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:00,152
[SPEAKER_05]: and the new schools within our community.

65
00:07:00,672 --> 00:07:06,775
[SPEAKER_05]: And during this past year, the schools, the city council passes a budget that gives an increase of over $2 million to the school department.

66
00:07:07,316 --> 00:07:07,916
[SPEAKER_05]: And what do they do?

67
00:07:07,996 --> 00:07:12,438
[SPEAKER_05]: They add more administrators and to an overgrowing need.

68
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:14,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe that doesn't even need to be needed.

69
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:17,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we ought to be looking at teachers and more classroom things that are necessary.

70
00:07:18,001 --> 00:07:26,566
[SPEAKER_05]: So the stabilization account, I've got no problem with that council, but I'd rather prioritize that because the council did make an agreement in January of last year,

71
00:07:27,691 --> 00:07:29,332
[SPEAKER_05]: that the police station will be their first priority.

72
00:07:29,373 --> 00:07:31,735
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm assuming that the council is still on board for this.

73
00:07:33,016 --> 00:07:34,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we should ask the counselors.

74
00:07:34,197 --> 00:07:35,558
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, what's your priority?

75
00:07:35,658 --> 00:07:39,862
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it the police department or is it just for all municipal buildings as needed when needed?

76
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,103
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, you know what?

77
00:07:41,924 --> 00:07:48,350
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, it's my motion at this point, I'll even strike out the police station, uh, wording and just set up the account.

78
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,912
[SPEAKER_18]: It takes four votes of the council to set up the account.

79
00:07:51,434 --> 00:07:55,415
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think we have to just set up the account with the intent of big projects like the police station.

80
00:07:55,615 --> 00:08:00,217
[SPEAKER_18]: Because you're right, council, I don't want to pit group against group and things of that nature.

81
00:08:00,637 --> 00:08:05,379
[SPEAKER_18]: In order for the mayor to utilize the money, he's going to need the votes of this council anyway at some point.

82
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:12,861
[SPEAKER_18]: So if I can, Mr. President, strike out the word such as the police station in the near future and just set up for any major projects.

83
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:16,722
[SPEAKER_18]: And if you want to put a dollar amount, go ahead.

84
00:08:17,943 --> 00:08:21,284
[SPEAKER_14]: So that amends Councilor Camuso's motion

85
00:08:22,006 --> 00:08:24,507
[SPEAKER_14]: And Councilor Knight has patiently waited.

86
00:08:25,027 --> 00:08:29,047
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much, Mr. President, and thank you, Councilor Camuso, for bringing this resolution forward.

87
00:08:30,068 --> 00:08:36,509
[SPEAKER_11]: In my time on the Council, I've seen similar papers to this where we want to set up an account, whether it be for capital improvements or a rainy day fund.

88
00:08:36,829 --> 00:08:37,789
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think it's a good idea.

89
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:44,171
[SPEAKER_11]: I think this is something that the city needs to build upon some of the commentary that Councilor Pinter has made.

90
00:08:44,511 --> 00:08:47,671
[SPEAKER_11]: I think funding this account is going to be vital.

91
00:08:47,691 --> 00:08:51,092
[SPEAKER_11]: Setting it up is one thing, but funding the account is certainly something else.

92
00:08:52,052 --> 00:08:56,294
[SPEAKER_11]: I would be very wary, however, of going forward and putting together an actual dollar amount.

93
00:08:56,354 --> 00:09:04,878
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that the way we might want to look at this is whether it be a percentage of free cash or whether or not a threshold is met and then a certain percentage can go up.

94
00:09:04,918 --> 00:09:10,740
[SPEAKER_11]: If we have $6 million in free cash, then no less than 5% will go into the stabilization fund, something like that.

95
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,341
[SPEAKER_11]: We can get very creative with the language here.

96
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:14,302
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that we can really get some bang for our buck.

97
00:09:14,891 --> 00:09:16,932
[SPEAKER_11]: provided that the administration's on board, Mr. President.

98
00:09:17,413 --> 00:09:23,036
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a paper that I'll be supporting wholeheartedly, and I ask my council colleagues to join me, commend Councilor Camuso for bringing it forward.

99
00:09:23,476 --> 00:09:24,397
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

100
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:25,557
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Longo-Kern.

101
00:09:25,597 --> 00:09:26,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, President DelaRusso.

102
00:09:26,838 --> 00:09:27,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a question.

103
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:37,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we talking about taking the funds from free cash and the other surplus accounts, or are we talking about a line item in the budget?

104
00:09:37,704 --> 00:09:41,026
[SPEAKER_18]: This would be an account, a line item in the budget, a municipal account.

105
00:09:42,768 --> 00:09:44,729
[SPEAKER_18]: set up by the mayor's office.

106
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:52,674
[SPEAKER_18]: And going forward, naturally, if the mayor wanted to put any money from any of those other accounts into this account, he'd have to get votes of the council.

107
00:09:52,774 --> 00:10:02,720
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'd be happy with it, setting the account up with the $1 amount and working with the mayor throughout the calendar year and years to come to fund it as we see fit.

108
00:10:03,601 --> 00:10:06,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, I believe that the city should have an account

109
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:13,041
[SPEAKER_03]: for municipal buildings and infrastructure in general.

110
00:10:13,061 --> 00:10:16,421
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, um, I think this, and I think it's a good resolve.

111
00:10:16,461 --> 00:10:34,445
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that it's something that the council probably should sit down in a committee of the whole meeting with regards to even in, in, in hopes to invite the mayor and possibly have him, you know, round table, you know, where's the city going with regards to reserves and, you know, stabilization fund, how much reserves are we going to have?

112
00:10:35,154 --> 00:10:39,437
[SPEAKER_03]: in these four or five accounts before we say, OK, enough is enough.

113
00:10:39,777 --> 00:10:47,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's either start taxing the people to the max or start putting money into a stabilization fund for infrastructure.

114
00:10:47,503 --> 00:10:56,429
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we need to see the big picture, because the free cash, overly surplus, water-retained earnings, those accounts keep getting higher and higher and higher.

115
00:10:56,889 --> 00:11:02,633
[SPEAKER_03]: And Director Burke was before us probably a month ago and said, we don't have to go out to bond on anything anytime soon.

116
00:11:04,153 --> 00:11:08,696
[SPEAKER_03]: But yet we always have the argument that we need the AAA bond rating.

117
00:11:08,796 --> 00:11:24,806
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think we need to figure out as a whole where we're at, how high those accounts should be or the city wants them to be before we can give the taxpayer a break and before we can start adding money to a stabilization account.

118
00:11:25,247 --> 00:11:28,589
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just think the big picture is worth a sit down with the committee.

119
00:11:28,809 --> 00:11:33,592
[SPEAKER_14]: So as you say, if I just may briefly from the chair to summarize that either

120
00:11:34,818 --> 00:11:42,041
[SPEAKER_14]: lower the taxation for what this money that we're amassing, spend it on something that gives the people their money's worth.

121
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:44,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Or put it in a stabilization fund.

122
00:11:44,342 --> 00:11:48,944
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think we should be taxing any more than we already are, which would include a stabilization fund.

123
00:11:48,964 --> 00:11:53,486
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we have money that is left over each budget time that gets certified as free cash.

124
00:11:53,786 --> 00:11:56,507
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe a percentage of that should go into a stabilization fund.

125
00:11:56,607 --> 00:12:00,369
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think we should tax above and beyond what we already are taxing for this fund.

126
00:12:01,106 --> 00:12:03,227
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you on the motion.

127
00:12:03,247 --> 00:12:04,468
[SPEAKER_18]: That was not the intent.

128
00:12:04,889 --> 00:12:07,270
[SPEAKER_18]: We can't tax any more until next December anyway.

129
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,871
[SPEAKER_18]: So I just want to be loud and clear.

130
00:12:08,911 --> 00:12:11,953
[SPEAKER_18]: This is not to raise taxes or anything.

131
00:12:11,973 --> 00:12:16,136
[SPEAKER_18]: It's taking the existing funds or and or come budget time to put funds in it.

132
00:12:16,837 --> 00:12:17,157
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

133
00:12:17,197 --> 00:12:19,479
[SPEAKER_14]: Counselor Penta, counsel along with current council marks.

134
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:21,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

135
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:26,543
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we've all voted in the past to create capital improvement funds.

136
00:12:27,184 --> 00:12:28,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, this is also a great idea.

137
00:12:29,513 --> 00:12:37,198
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree with Councilor Knight that we do have an existing fund, which is called free cash.

138
00:12:37,539 --> 00:12:39,820
[SPEAKER_04]: It's nothing more than the taxpayer's money.

139
00:12:40,561 --> 00:12:42,802
[SPEAKER_04]: And that has existed for many years now.

140
00:12:43,382 --> 00:12:57,312
[SPEAKER_04]: And every time this council or members of this council have tried to use the free cash to either lower taxes or do some infrastructure improvement, we heard over and over again that they didn't want to tap into the free cash.

141
00:12:57,769 --> 00:12:59,510
[SPEAKER_04]: because it might hurt the bond rating.

142
00:13:00,391 --> 00:13:14,662
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd be very hesitant on saying if we set up an account in the budget that we're going to be able to get the mayor, who's been very hesitant on using that free cash for other issues, to put money from free cash into this particular line item.

143
00:13:15,565 --> 00:13:20,407
[SPEAKER_04]: So eventually this line item will have to be funded by an increase in taxes.

144
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:21,968
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no way around it.

145
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:31,332
[SPEAKER_04]: So when we vote for the budget and the mayor just say wants to put $400,000 in this stabilization fund, that's going to come from the taxpayers.

146
00:13:31,792 --> 00:13:35,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Meanwhile, we already have $6 million in free cash sitting out there.

147
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:39,536
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't want to see, to be quite honest with you, I think it's

148
00:13:39,878 --> 00:13:47,481
[SPEAKER_04]: a great idea to have rainy day funds and everything else, but I believe we already have the means to do what we want for capital improvement.

149
00:13:47,901 --> 00:13:57,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Not on a major scale of building a police department, but on a smaller scale, we do have cash available to do infrastructure improvements.

150
00:13:57,744 --> 00:14:07,808
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd be very hesitant on setting up an account that is going to be additional, something that's going to be over and above what we already have out there.

151
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:09,228
[SPEAKER_04]: As Councilor Camuso mentioned,

152
00:14:09,538 --> 00:14:20,285
[SPEAKER_04]: We have linkage money that business owners give to the community by city ordinance when they come in and build or renovate to a certain size in this community, they have to pay linkage money.

153
00:14:20,605 --> 00:14:21,646
[SPEAKER_04]: We have the free cash.

154
00:14:22,026 --> 00:14:29,150
[SPEAKER_04]: We have the water and sewer enterprise account that has multi millions of dollars in surplus in those accounts.

155
00:14:29,691 --> 00:14:35,434
[SPEAKER_04]: And I realized those accounts can't be used for a lot of different issues only for water and sewer issues.

156
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:36,295
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um,

157
00:14:37,058 --> 00:14:46,640
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's appropriate that we sit down, Committee of the Whole, whatever subcommittee, discuss this first before we make a step forward about putting this in the budget.

158
00:14:47,801 --> 00:14:51,802
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a great idea, but I think it merits some discussion first.

159
00:14:52,602 --> 00:15:01,124
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, as one, think we should proceed with caution when we want to create a new account, because the only one that is going to fund this account is the taxpayers.

160
00:15:01,724 --> 00:15:02,604
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no way around it.

161
00:15:03,285 --> 00:15:04,925
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to make sure that

162
00:15:05,813 --> 00:15:09,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, we, we know what's going to happen before we move forward.

163
00:15:09,195 --> 00:15:09,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President.

164
00:15:10,616 --> 00:15:10,956
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

165
00:15:10,996 --> 00:15:11,817
[SPEAKER_14]: Counselor mocks.

166
00:15:11,917 --> 00:15:12,677
[SPEAKER_14]: Counselor Penta.

167
00:15:13,137 --> 00:15:13,938
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, two points.

168
00:15:14,398 --> 00:15:16,799
[SPEAKER_05]: I think everybody has a whole host of good ideas over here.

169
00:15:16,819 --> 00:15:18,821
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I can see two points happening here.

170
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:25,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, the history of the city for the last four years at the end of each and every year is accumulated a surplus of approximately a million dollars.

171
00:15:26,485 --> 00:15:35,090
[SPEAKER_05]: So each and every year we've had close to a million dollars, anywhere from nine 70 to over a million, a million one that gets itself certified and free cash as a result of the end of the year.

172
00:15:35,587 --> 00:15:58,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, if I follow what Councilor Knight has alluded to by maybe taking a percentage, maybe we can take an idea, following what you are saying, Councilor Camuso, put a dollar in to start it, and then take a percentage, maybe one, two, or three percent of whatever the surplus is going to be at the end of the year before free cash comes in, and that way you're not taxing the people because you know at the end of the year there's a surplus that it's not the people who are not going to have to pay for.

173
00:15:58,763 --> 00:16:02,766
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be one way of moving the money around without having to

174
00:16:03,597 --> 00:16:05,958
[SPEAKER_05]: put a separate account as Council Mark said a little too because he's right.

175
00:16:06,018 --> 00:16:07,699
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to come from the taxpayers one way or the other.

176
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:26,410
[SPEAKER_05]: So if in fact we're fortunate or the taxpayers pay enough into paying their taxes into the city and for whatever reason is unfortunately or fortunately each and every year in June we have a surplus certified by the Department of Revenue close to over a million dollars and that's how we get our accumulation of over seven million dollars.

177
00:16:26,971 --> 00:16:30,713
[SPEAKER_05]: It was almost seven and a half, eight million dollars for which the mayor this past I believe November

178
00:16:31,356 --> 00:16:42,262
[SPEAKER_05]: presented before the council a whole host of issues for which we voted $1.23 million from free cash to satisfy those requests that he had, which leaves us with approximately $7 million.

179
00:16:42,802 --> 00:16:44,924
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've got no problem creating the count.

180
00:16:45,384 --> 00:16:46,424
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I want to do at this point.

181
00:16:46,464 --> 00:17:00,132
[SPEAKER_05]: But to fund the account, I think it should come from the surplus, if any, in any particular year that the city council ends its fiscal year, June 30th, and whatever is certified as a remainder in free cash by the Department of Revenue

182
00:17:00,428 --> 00:17:06,052
[SPEAKER_05]: and I think Councilor Lungo was right, maybe we should just go to a Committee of the Whole and come up with a percentage of whatever it might be.

183
00:17:07,012 --> 00:17:19,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Following Councilor Marks' commentary, the Mayor's gonna be on board with this, and if he's not gonna be on board, you know, I mean, he doesn't talk to us about anything, so this is gonna be something that's gonna have to be creatively done between and amongst ourselves.

184
00:17:20,021 --> 00:17:29,447
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would support your resolution, putting a dollar in there, a dollar in there, on the condition that we have a Committee of the Whole meeting for the purposes of deciding

185
00:17:29,908 --> 00:17:42,831
[SPEAKER_05]: How we're going to maintain or put the money into that account, my choice, preference would be whatever the surplus is at the end of the year, certified by the Department of Revenue and Free Cash, then we have to decide amongst ourselves, 1%, 2%, 3%, whatever it is.

186
00:17:43,151 --> 00:17:53,614
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a no cost to the taxpayer at that point in time, and at least it gets ourselves going, whether it's for a police department, whether it's for City Hall, or for whether it's the $1.2 million in school repairs that are necessary.

187
00:17:53,814 --> 00:17:54,454
[SPEAKER_05]: It needs to be done.

188
00:17:55,002 --> 00:17:55,902
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no question about it.

189
00:17:56,382 --> 00:17:58,143
[SPEAKER_05]: So that would be my amendment to the resolution.

190
00:17:58,803 --> 00:18:00,363
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you get that Mr. Clark?

191
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,243
[SPEAKER_14]: Any clarity for the clerk?

192
00:18:03,964 --> 00:18:06,624
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you referring the paper now to the committee?

193
00:18:06,664 --> 00:18:06,804
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

194
00:18:06,904 --> 00:18:08,364
[SPEAKER_15]: In doing all this stuff?

195
00:18:08,424 --> 00:18:08,585
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

196
00:18:09,465 --> 00:18:11,645
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you trying to split the resolution?

197
00:18:11,745 --> 00:18:18,786
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm amending his resolution to say that I will support it to put a dollar in there.

198
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:20,427
[SPEAKER_15]: I will support it by way of an amendment.

199
00:18:22,346 --> 00:18:23,508
[SPEAKER_05]: The council is going to have to vote on this.

200
00:18:24,009 --> 00:18:24,590
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an amendment.

201
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:25,432
[SPEAKER_05]: It's his resolution.

202
00:18:25,652 --> 00:18:26,734
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a resolution.

203
00:18:27,255 --> 00:18:30,642
[SPEAKER_18]: If I can, I agree with Councillor Pinto totally.

204
00:18:34,378 --> 00:18:34,938
[SPEAKER_18]: Which cleanup?

205
00:18:35,238 --> 00:18:41,019
[SPEAKER_18]: Making it an amendment or do you want to add your name to the original paper and we can do whatever you want to do.

206
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:43,240
[SPEAKER_18]: I know the two part prong approach.

207
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:46,881
[SPEAKER_18]: Establish the account and then do what Councilor Lungo and Councilor Marks said.

208
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:49,961
[SPEAKER_18]: After the dollar account is established, it's just a line item in the budget.

209
00:18:50,121 --> 00:18:51,481
[SPEAKER_18]: It may not be funded for 10 years.

210
00:18:51,902 --> 00:18:53,322
[SPEAKER_18]: We have things that are funded.

211
00:18:55,762 --> 00:18:57,583
[SPEAKER_14]: Point of information, Councilor Marks.

212
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:01,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Our vote doesn't establish an account.

213
00:19:01,684 --> 00:19:02,484
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a recommendation.

214
00:19:02,624 --> 00:19:03,924
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a recommendation to the mayor.

215
00:19:04,716 --> 00:19:04,856
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't.

216
00:19:04,896 --> 00:19:16,062
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so before we make a recommendation to the mayor, I rather dot our I's and cross our T's and make a recommendation based on maybe something with council and I mentioned about a certain percentage.

217
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:25,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I don't see why we shouldn't send this to a committee, the whole first, and then take a vote on it after to send it to the mayor with our recommendations.

218
00:19:25,047 --> 00:19:30,409
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that makes more sense than just asking to put, uh, the mayor put an account out there.

219
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:33,271
[SPEAKER_04]: And once, if you say he does establish the account,

220
00:19:34,425 --> 00:19:36,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Our process is meaningless after that.

221
00:19:36,646 --> 00:19:40,208
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we can go to them and say, Mr. Mayor, we do this and this, but it's meaningless.

222
00:19:40,488 --> 00:19:43,029
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd rather hand them the full paper.

223
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:47,432
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, I agree with Councilor Penta.

224
00:19:48,292 --> 00:19:50,213
[SPEAKER_18]: I support your amendment wholeheartedly.

225
00:19:50,253 --> 00:19:53,975
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd like to establish this and then send this to the Committee of the Whole.

226
00:19:54,365 --> 00:20:06,274
[SPEAKER_18]: for discussion to fund it in the future, prior to the budget this year, but as far as getting the, this council has to be proactive by getting that account set up, even if he does it, he may tell us no, he's not doing it, but at least get the account set up.

227
00:20:06,994 --> 00:20:12,798
[SPEAKER_18]: There's no harm in doing that, as Councilor Pence has stated, and I thank you for meeting me halfway, Councilor Penter, on this.

228
00:20:14,219 --> 00:20:14,940
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight.

229
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:19,043
[SPEAKER_11]: I think everybody's made some very good points here.

230
00:20:19,483 --> 00:20:22,726
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's important to point out, though, if there's no account, then there's,

231
00:20:23,495 --> 00:20:24,455
[SPEAKER_11]: no place to put this money.

232
00:20:24,495 --> 00:20:28,817
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that the establishment of the account is going to be critical in this success.

233
00:20:28,917 --> 00:20:37,961
[SPEAKER_11]: I also think that moving forward, we probably should sit in the Committee of the Whole and discuss what we'd like to see happen.

234
00:20:38,201 --> 00:20:45,625
[SPEAKER_11]: And we can do that every single year, and we don't have to set necessarily a criteria that's going to be carried on from the day that it's implemented until the day that it's ended.

235
00:20:45,925 --> 00:20:51,427
[SPEAKER_11]: We might be able to propose three or four different options as to how to fund this account once the account is exactly established.

236
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:55,904
[SPEAKER_11]: based upon the financial picture, the financial snapshot that we received at that point in time.

237
00:20:56,564 --> 00:21:01,168
[SPEAKER_11]: So I can certainly understand Councilor Muck's point where he says we can create the account.

238
00:21:01,248 --> 00:21:06,493
[SPEAKER_11]: Once the account's created, then we lose all control and oversight over the account and our recommendations are just going to be that, just recommendations.

239
00:21:06,853 --> 00:21:20,064
[SPEAKER_11]: Whereas if we have this paper in the committee of the whole and we sit down and we vet it properly and we go on to really create a program and we present it to the mayor for him to either accept or deny, then it's on him as to whether or not he wants to establish this capital improvement trust fund.

240
00:21:20,932 --> 00:21:24,555
[SPEAKER_11]: or long-term stabilization account, a rainy day account, or whatever you want to call it.

241
00:21:25,276 --> 00:21:31,942
[SPEAKER_11]: So I certainly could see both sides of the issue here, but I think that the most important thing really is establishing the account first and foremost.

242
00:21:32,002 --> 00:21:35,246
[SPEAKER_11]: And once we get the account established, then we can figure out what we're going to do and how we're going to fund it.

243
00:21:35,266 --> 00:21:36,687
[SPEAKER_11]: And we can do that every year during budget time.

244
00:21:37,488 --> 00:21:38,509
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Counselor Knight.

245
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:56,286
[SPEAKER_14]: We still have yet to receive a clear amendment from Councilor Penta on how he wants to amend the main motion, which was already amended by Councilor Penta, uh, Councilor Camuso to remove the term such as the police station.

246
00:21:56,566 --> 00:22:04,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Before we get the, before we even get into that, I think it needs to be understood that one of the reasons why we're doing this is because of a police station possibility issue.

247
00:22:04,953 --> 00:22:09,695
[SPEAKER_05]: or of our public library, or our municipal buildings, or our school department buildings.

248
00:22:10,056 --> 00:22:15,458
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we have a whole host of issues here that taxpayers are paying for on a daily, annual, weekly basis here.

249
00:22:15,978 --> 00:22:28,705
[SPEAKER_05]: So my resolution is to establish, and it also is recommending to the mayor, establishing a stabilization account for the purposes of reviewing our municipal buildings.

250
00:22:29,005 --> 00:22:31,666
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like the idea of putting the priority with a police station first.

251
00:22:31,966 --> 00:22:33,327
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you can do what you want.

252
00:22:33,817 --> 00:22:43,765
[SPEAKER_05]: And then go to a committee of the whole meeting for the purposes of how are we going to recommend further to the mayor where the monies would come from.

253
00:22:43,905 --> 00:22:55,775
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we follow it, council marks is alluded to providing it doesn't come out of the everyday tax payers rate because we're dealing with surplus clarification, council, vice president.

254
00:22:55,835 --> 00:23:01,720
[SPEAKER_03]: I just think what you're saying now is different than the actual amendment you said to the clerk 10 minutes ago.

255
00:23:02,161 --> 00:23:02,681
[SPEAKER_05]: But what do you have?

256
00:23:02,721 --> 00:23:03,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell me what you have, Mr. Quirk.

257
00:23:04,261 --> 00:23:06,342
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I just wrote just what you just said this time.

258
00:23:06,582 --> 00:23:06,982
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

259
00:23:07,062 --> 00:23:08,162
[SPEAKER_05]: It says the same thing.

260
00:23:08,322 --> 00:23:08,883
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, sorry.

261
00:23:09,123 --> 00:23:12,964
[SPEAKER_14]: Which is actually a recapitulation of Councilor Camuso's motion.

262
00:23:14,404 --> 00:23:16,564
[SPEAKER_15]: But I just had a motion.

263
00:23:16,744 --> 00:23:18,465
[SPEAKER_15]: Set up the account and have a committee of the whole.

264
00:23:18,485 --> 00:23:19,605
[SPEAKER_15]: Set up the account.

265
00:23:20,005 --> 00:23:20,585
[SPEAKER_15]: Keep it simple.

266
00:23:20,625 --> 00:23:27,827
[SPEAKER_15]: With your purposes of going to a committee of the whole meeting, the purposes are to establish where the money is coming from.

267
00:23:28,847 --> 00:23:30,648
[SPEAKER_15]: That's really what I condensed it into.

268
00:23:32,573 --> 00:23:32,773
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

269
00:23:33,393 --> 00:23:35,294
[SPEAKER_15]: In which it could be municipal buildings or whatever.

270
00:23:35,334 --> 00:23:42,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm assuming, but I think council, the intent of this is few municipal buildings.

271
00:23:42,237 --> 00:23:43,737
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm assuming that's your priority here.

272
00:23:44,078 --> 00:23:46,759
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a stabilization fund for years to come.

273
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:49,500
[SPEAKER_18]: I put the police station in, but you were brought up a very good point.

274
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,261
[SPEAKER_18]: The library needed this 1.2 for the school.

275
00:23:52,301 --> 00:23:56,022
[SPEAKER_18]: So just set up the account as a stabilization fund.

276
00:23:56,643 --> 00:24:02,345
[SPEAKER_18]: And then the committee of the whole sort of keep it simple at this point.

277
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:05,950
[SPEAKER_02]: do we, one more point of clarification.

278
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:08,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Did we establish a fund like this in 2003, 2004?

279
00:24:09,051 --> 00:24:11,893
[SPEAKER_14]: The clerk seems to think so.

280
00:24:13,874 --> 00:24:15,535
[SPEAKER_02]: If we could get a clarification on that.

281
00:24:15,795 --> 00:24:30,223
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, you have to be confirmed by obviously the auditor, but we, we did these establish stabilization in the early 2000, 2003 and the money came from, uh, from free cash, excess free cash.

282
00:24:31,197 --> 00:24:36,919
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, and then it was used to lower the tax rate.

283
00:24:37,859 --> 00:24:49,042
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe also Mr. President, my office year, but I mean, but I think the account, I'm just saying that I think the account actually exists unless, unless the city had closed it down because of inactivity all this time.

284
00:24:49,583 --> 00:24:51,103
[SPEAKER_15]: But there was a stabilization fund.

285
00:24:51,123 --> 00:24:52,824
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like, it's not part of the budget.

286
00:24:52,844 --> 00:24:55,624
[SPEAKER_15]: It's really, it's like a revolving account and it's one way.

287
00:24:55,764 --> 00:25:00,746
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, it's an ongoing, see with free cash, certain free cash, you have to use it all up.

288
00:25:01,318 --> 00:25:02,439
[SPEAKER_15]: before the fiscal year ends.

289
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,821
[SPEAKER_15]: So you take free cash.

290
00:25:03,861 --> 00:25:18,556
[SPEAKER_15]: Now you put it on this thing and it becomes ongoing now, but it has, but you can't, the mayor has to recommend, uh, where the money goes to, but it can't, but it has to be voted on the council to allow it to go to that.

291
00:25:18,836 --> 00:25:22,220
[SPEAKER_05]: But the council has made recommendations in the past, not a stabilization account.

292
00:25:22,547 --> 00:25:25,428
[SPEAKER_05]: but for revolving accounts for which the administration has adopted.

293
00:25:25,448 --> 00:25:26,728
[SPEAKER_15]: But this is like a revolve.

294
00:25:26,748 --> 00:25:29,249
[SPEAKER_15]: But I'm just saying, we have made the recommendations before.

295
00:25:29,269 --> 00:25:38,431
[SPEAKER_15]: In the council, they did make a recommendation to take whatever money was there at that time to go to the tax rate, which had happened.

296
00:25:38,631 --> 00:25:40,592
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's zero balance in there now.

297
00:25:40,632 --> 00:25:41,752
[SPEAKER_15]: But it did happen before.

298
00:25:42,032 --> 00:25:43,833
[SPEAKER_15]: So it doesn't become part of the budget, though.

299
00:25:44,333 --> 00:25:46,453
[SPEAKER_15]: It just becomes like a revolving account.

300
00:25:47,354 --> 00:25:47,654
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

301
00:25:47,674 --> 00:25:51,455
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Petro, will you allow Councilor Marks to have the floor?

302
00:25:51,555 --> 00:25:52,055
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, go ahead.

303
00:25:53,763 --> 00:26:02,567
[SPEAKER_04]: with the city clerk is stating, we should check into, we should be prudent and check into if there is a stabilization account already established.

304
00:26:04,088 --> 00:26:08,790
[SPEAKER_04]: I would prefer to use a stabilization fund outside of the budget.

305
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:22,276
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would caution the members of the council that once the mayor gets a report from us stating that he'd like to see a stabilization account within the budget, he'll go off and create one in the budget,

306
00:26:23,047 --> 00:26:26,508
[SPEAKER_04]: He may put $4 or $5 million in that account.

307
00:26:27,709 --> 00:26:29,029
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not going to have any say in that.

308
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:34,491
[SPEAKER_04]: All you can do is vote up or down in the budget or reduce the budget.

309
00:26:35,712 --> 00:26:39,253
[SPEAKER_04]: So you'll have, just say, $4 or $5 million in an account this year.

310
00:26:39,653 --> 00:26:42,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Taxes are going to go up because it's not part of the free cash.

311
00:26:43,855 --> 00:26:47,516
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he's going to say the council requested that this take place.

312
00:26:48,937 --> 00:26:51,638
[SPEAKER_04]: And then to use that line item in the budget,

313
00:26:52,092 --> 00:26:53,493
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a vote of this council.

314
00:26:55,294 --> 00:27:02,998
[SPEAKER_04]: So the mayor could take that money out and do another project similar to the peace garden in the square or whatever else he wants to do.

315
00:27:03,978 --> 00:27:09,321
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't, I wouldn't be so quick tonight to just create a line item in the budget.

316
00:27:09,901 --> 00:27:10,982
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what that gets us.

317
00:27:11,442 --> 00:27:15,684
[SPEAKER_04]: I rather sit back, have a committee, the whole meeting discuss this first.

318
00:27:15,764 --> 00:27:21,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we can bring in in Baker, the finance director, the treasurer collector, the mayor himself,

319
00:27:22,318 --> 00:27:31,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone else, and discuss this first, because I'm not quite sure a line item in the budget will be the appropriate way of keeping a stabilization fund.

320
00:27:31,861 --> 00:27:46,346
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a great idea, but I think if we could do it outside the budget through these revolving accounts, makes more sense, and also the council would have input eventually when the mayor wants to go into these particular accounts.

321
00:27:46,686 --> 00:27:52,148
[SPEAKER_04]: He would need support of the council, and there we can make sure, yes, we approve that project, Mr. Mayor,

322
00:27:52,535 --> 00:27:58,319
[SPEAKER_04]: because it's on the council's priority list as the police department or the library or wherever it might be.

323
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:01,942
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be road improvements, uh, crosswalk improvements.

324
00:28:02,242 --> 00:28:03,003
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be anything.

325
00:28:03,543 --> 00:28:18,595
[SPEAKER_04]: So I, I, you know, I can't vote tonight on, uh, just, uh, getting a line item in the budget and then discussing it after the fact, because I've been around here a number of years and, uh, you know, I, I rather do it, uh, all together.

326
00:28:18,615 --> 00:28:21,677
[SPEAKER_04]: I rather have a thoughtful plan that's outlined,

327
00:28:22,462 --> 00:28:27,526
[SPEAKER_04]: before we just do a knee-jerk reaction about putting something in the budget that makes us feel good.

328
00:28:27,826 --> 00:28:29,607
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we all want a capital improvement plan.

329
00:28:29,807 --> 00:28:31,789
[SPEAKER_04]: We've all voted on it three dozen times.

330
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:35,672
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, it's ultimately up to the mayor.

331
00:28:35,992 --> 00:28:50,162
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not sure, you know, the feel-good reaction we're going to get tonight saying that, you know, we created a stabilization or a capital improvement fund as a line item in the budget is going to accomplish anything more than just that.

332
00:28:50,582 --> 00:28:52,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Creating a line item in the budget, Mr. President.

333
00:28:53,183 --> 00:28:54,264
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

334
00:28:54,404 --> 00:28:55,244
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight.

335
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:57,025
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

336
00:28:57,045 --> 00:28:58,646
[SPEAKER_14]: Then Councilor Lange, Vice President Lange.

337
00:28:59,307 --> 00:29:00,107
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

338
00:29:02,128 --> 00:29:10,532
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that there's been recent discussions from the Baker administration that there may be an edict or requirement that municipalities do establish a rainy day fund or a stabilization fund.

339
00:29:10,933 --> 00:29:15,275
[SPEAKER_11]: Until that comes to fruition, you know, that's just rumor, that's just talk, that's just hearsay.

340
00:29:15,825 --> 00:29:21,268
[SPEAKER_11]: However, this is something that may be coming down the line, so I do think it's important that we stay proactive on it.

341
00:29:21,308 --> 00:29:28,352
[SPEAKER_11]: The resolution reads right now, be it resolved that the City of Medford establish a long-term stabilization fund to offset any major projects.

342
00:29:29,232 --> 00:29:30,833
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that language is good enough in itself.

343
00:29:30,893 --> 00:29:38,617
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we can now figure out what course we want to take, whether or not it's a budgeted line item, whether or not it's a separate account, whether or not

344
00:29:39,287 --> 00:29:43,909
[SPEAKER_11]: we can sit down and negotiate, discuss, and plan a way to implement this.

345
00:29:43,929 --> 00:29:45,790
[SPEAKER_19]: Point of information, Mr. President?

346
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:47,451
[SPEAKER_11]: Point of information, Councilor Marks.

347
00:29:47,711 --> 00:29:56,155
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that's what the resolution reads, but I'm almost positive Councilor Camuso recommended, as part of this resolution, to put a line item in the budget.

348
00:29:57,055 --> 00:29:58,516
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's different than what you just read.

349
00:29:58,616 --> 00:29:58,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

350
00:29:58,996 --> 00:29:59,856
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to get to that.

351
00:29:59,876 --> 00:30:05,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Yours is more of a general statement, where he was specific, saying he wants us to vote on putting a line item in the budget.

352
00:30:05,099 --> 00:30:06,359
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm coming around full circle to that.

353
00:30:06,959 --> 00:30:07,700
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, OK.

354
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:08,260
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

355
00:30:08,969 --> 00:30:13,971
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so, you know, in looking at it, I think that, you know, that the language of the resolution is what the language of the resolution is.

356
00:30:14,292 --> 00:30:20,854
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a number of members here that are all pretty much on the same page in terms of supporting the idea and supporting the theory.

357
00:30:21,235 --> 00:30:24,876
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think it might make sense to support the theory, support the language that's before us.

358
00:30:25,196 --> 00:30:27,497
[SPEAKER_11]: Then we can sit down with the committee of the whole or a subcommittee.

359
00:30:27,798 --> 00:30:30,919
[SPEAKER_11]: We can have Anne Baker, the budget director, we can have

360
00:30:31,312 --> 00:30:33,934
[SPEAKER_11]: the May account and sit down with us and figure out what it is they can live with.

361
00:30:33,974 --> 00:30:39,178
[SPEAKER_11]: Whether it's not, there's something that if they're willing to put a line item budget in, if they're not, if they want it in the budget and we don't, that's okay.

362
00:30:39,518 --> 00:30:47,604
[SPEAKER_11]: We can negotiate, we can discuss, and we can plan ways to implement this and ways to fund this sitting down at the same table all together as opposed to it's an us versus them.

363
00:30:47,624 --> 00:30:48,685
[SPEAKER_11]: This is what we say, what do you say?

364
00:30:49,085 --> 00:30:51,647
[SPEAKER_11]: Why don't we say, let's set up the account, we all agree that we need an account.

365
00:30:52,088 --> 00:30:54,690
[SPEAKER_11]: Then we can sit down in the same room and figure out exactly what the plan is.

366
00:30:55,090 --> 00:31:00,154
[SPEAKER_11]: A mutually agreeable plan that we can all live with in terms of how we're going to fund this and what direction we want to see the account going.

367
00:31:00,644 --> 00:31:01,545
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Council Knight.

368
00:31:01,645 --> 00:31:02,546
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Lococo.

369
00:31:02,886 --> 00:31:04,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, President De La Russo.

370
00:31:05,088 --> 00:31:11,213
[SPEAKER_03]: Just simply, I don't, I can't support something when I don't know if there's actually an account already set up.

371
00:31:11,513 --> 00:31:19,880
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know how any of us could vote to, if we want a stabilization fund, how we can vote to increase it to two stabilization funds or two accounts.

372
00:31:20,441 --> 00:31:22,062
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to find out that information first.

373
00:31:22,242 --> 00:31:28,808
[SPEAKER_03]: I would rather have a committee of the whole meeting before we vote on something like this, but at the very least we need to know if this account already exists.

374
00:31:29,483 --> 00:31:36,625
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I cannot support this tonight if I think that the account already exists, because I definitely do not want two accounts having the same purpose.

375
00:31:37,486 --> 00:31:46,549
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is, you know, we just found out what the resolve was completely, you know, entails, we have all different ideas, and we have questions of if a fund already exists.

376
00:31:46,609 --> 00:31:49,210
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think this really needs to go to the Committee of the Whole first.

377
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:51,711
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think we have anything scheduled for next week.

378
00:31:51,751 --> 00:31:53,451
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we can set it up for next week.

379
00:31:53,471 --> 00:31:54,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Over to questions.

380
00:31:54,331 --> 00:31:57,252
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a motion for approval on the floor from Councilor Camuso.

381
00:31:57,633 --> 00:31:58,853
[SPEAKER_18]: As amended by Councilor Pence.

382
00:31:59,179 --> 00:32:03,343
[SPEAKER_14]: as amended by councilor Penta and myself and yourself.

383
00:32:04,003 --> 00:32:17,474
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, based on this language, I'm at roll call vote and further amended by councilor Penta to be followed by a committee of the whole meeting.

384
00:32:17,494 --> 00:32:17,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

385
00:32:17,995 --> 00:32:23,019
[SPEAKER_05]: Once approved, following the language that's written, followed by a committee of the whole meeting, roll call vote.

386
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:24,300
[SPEAKER_05]: And you have that almost a clip.

387
00:32:26,832 --> 00:32:28,814
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a point of clarification.

388
00:32:28,834 --> 00:32:29,594
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Mox.

389
00:32:29,794 --> 00:32:31,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a point of clarification.

390
00:32:31,055 --> 00:32:38,221
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're voting on the language that currently exists under Councilor Camuso's resolution.

391
00:32:38,561 --> 00:32:56,355
[SPEAKER_14]: As amended with also the further amendations by Councilor Panta, which was a recapitulation of the amended resolution of Councilor Camuso with the further amendation to bring the whole matter once approved to the committee of the whole.

392
00:32:58,122 --> 00:33:00,043
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're not approving a line item in the budget.

393
00:33:01,445 --> 00:33:02,846
[SPEAKER_14]: That was not in the language.

394
00:33:02,966 --> 00:33:03,826
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not in the language.

395
00:33:04,067 --> 00:33:04,287
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.

396
00:33:04,787 --> 00:33:05,067
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

397
00:33:05,428 --> 00:33:11,572
[SPEAKER_14]: And before we take the vote, we have a citizen patiently waiting at the podium to briefly address us.

398
00:33:11,592 --> 00:33:12,313
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Gene.

399
00:33:12,333 --> 00:33:14,294
[SPEAKER_14]: Please state your name and address for the record.

400
00:33:14,314 --> 00:33:15,755
[SPEAKER_01]: Gene Martin, 10 Cumming Street.

401
00:33:16,316 --> 00:33:20,339
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great idea in theory, but it's not plausible.

402
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:25,182
[SPEAKER_01]: We have been living off of federal grants.

403
00:33:25,542 --> 00:33:28,265
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been living high off of the federal hog for a long time.

404
00:33:28,345 --> 00:33:31,467
[SPEAKER_01]: Mayor McGlynn was good at bringing home the bacon from the federal government.

405
00:33:31,888 --> 00:33:37,272
[SPEAKER_01]: We have lived at a standard of living that we're not going to be able to move forward on.

406
00:33:38,393 --> 00:33:43,237
[SPEAKER_01]: Mayor McGlynn has not put 5% in for every single building for maintenance.

407
00:33:45,018 --> 00:33:49,662
[SPEAKER_01]: You can try to put money in this account, but it will get raided for some other reason sooner or later.

408
00:33:50,296 --> 00:33:52,016
[SPEAKER_01]: The federal government does it with Social Security.

409
00:33:52,056 --> 00:33:53,637
[SPEAKER_01]: They do it with the Transportation Trust Fund.

410
00:33:53,997 --> 00:33:54,777
[SPEAKER_01]: They do it all the time.

411
00:33:54,957 --> 00:33:58,278
[SPEAKER_01]: When there's a bunch of money and they need some emergency, they pull it out.

412
00:33:58,718 --> 00:34:00,879
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what's going to happen in the city, I'm sorry to say.

413
00:34:01,399 --> 00:34:04,600
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see how the program's going to work.

414
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:11,842
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great idea in theory, and you can do it in your personal life, but the government isn't good at saving money and putting it aside.

415
00:34:12,302 --> 00:34:16,063
[SPEAKER_01]: And as for the police station, I have one thing to say, which I know you took out.

416
00:34:16,603 --> 00:34:19,104
[SPEAKER_01]: But the mayor was ready to bond for

417
00:34:19,628 --> 00:34:20,428
[SPEAKER_01]: the water taxi.

418
00:34:20,469 --> 00:34:21,949
[SPEAKER_01]: He was ready to bond for the garage.

419
00:34:21,989 --> 00:34:23,490
[SPEAKER_01]: He was ready to bond for the old house.

420
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:26,512
[SPEAKER_01]: But he's not ready to bond for the police station.

421
00:34:27,072 --> 00:34:34,137
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't see why we have to wait and put money in their side for $2 million a year until we get $30 million in there to buy it.

422
00:34:34,757 --> 00:34:35,477
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't see it.

423
00:34:35,757 --> 00:34:36,498
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an emergency.

424
00:34:36,918 --> 00:34:37,639
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch the news.

425
00:34:37,999 --> 00:34:39,720
[SPEAKER_01]: Paris was up in flames last week.

426
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:42,341
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have more and more problems.

427
00:34:42,361 --> 00:34:43,322
[SPEAKER_01]: We have school shootings.

428
00:34:43,382 --> 00:34:44,503
[SPEAKER_01]: We have all kinds of crime.

429
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:45,943
[SPEAKER_01]: And to have a

430
00:34:47,747 --> 00:34:50,209
[SPEAKER_01]: a police station that is inadequate and up to par.

431
00:34:50,629 --> 00:34:54,352
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it technically is up to par, but it could be a lot better, and it could save lives.

432
00:34:54,893 --> 00:34:57,815
[SPEAKER_01]: It could do its job much better, and the people could do a job much better.

433
00:34:58,255 --> 00:35:04,520
[SPEAKER_01]: So while it's a good idea in theory to have this rainy day fund, I just don't see how you're financially going to be able to pull it off.

434
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:06,582
[SPEAKER_01]: But thank you very much for listening.

435
00:35:06,862 --> 00:35:07,363
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Ms.

436
00:35:07,383 --> 00:35:07,703
[SPEAKER_06]: Martin.

437
00:35:08,504 --> 00:35:10,465
[SPEAKER_06]: Sir, please state your name and address for the record.

438
00:35:10,905 --> 00:35:12,026
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

439
00:35:12,126 --> 00:35:13,448
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Robert Capucci of 71 Evans Street.

440
00:35:15,803 --> 00:35:18,204
[SPEAKER_06]: Just very briefly, I know you're a busy city council.

441
00:35:19,264 --> 00:35:22,884
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of agree with the previous speaker.

442
00:35:22,964 --> 00:35:25,425
[SPEAKER_06]: I wholeheartedly agree with the intentions.

443
00:35:25,965 --> 00:35:29,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Lord knows our city's roads need improvement, our buildings.

444
00:35:30,186 --> 00:35:33,667
[SPEAKER_06]: We need a full police force with a better facility.

445
00:35:34,287 --> 00:35:44,969
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't think creating a new account is the route to go since we already have accounts, free cash accounts, surplus accounts, and there may well already be an account

446
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,321
[SPEAKER_06]: that exists.

447
00:35:47,261 --> 00:35:57,747
[SPEAKER_06]: Through the chair to Councilor Knight, as an elected member of the Republican State Committee, I work with advisors to the new administration, being a Republican governor.

448
00:35:58,127 --> 00:36:14,396
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can tell you firsthand, there are cuts coming that will continue with the cuts of the previous administration, and might even be a little bit deeper, because after the transition happened, or during the transition, actually, when he was governor,

449
00:36:14,857 --> 00:36:21,419
[SPEAKER_06]: elect Baker, we come to find out that there was actually a shortfall of another billion dollars that we didn't know about.

450
00:36:21,439 --> 00:36:23,399
[SPEAKER_06]: So the cuts are definitely coming.

451
00:36:23,919 --> 00:36:43,764
[SPEAKER_06]: But Medford is in a unique position with this new parking program that contractually requires you to spend $250,000 a year on infrastructure that will be set up, if I'm correct, maybe the chief can come up and correct me, or the representative from Republic,

452
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:54,359
[SPEAKER_06]: This funding will be spent on infrastructure repairs based on how this city council rules those monies are to be spent.

453
00:36:54,899 --> 00:37:04,080
[SPEAKER_06]: So we are in a good position to actually do something very good for the citizens of Medford and maybe even the state at large.

454
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,121
[SPEAKER_06]: We have all this surplus.

455
00:37:06,521 --> 00:37:13,162
[SPEAKER_06]: We now have, which is about to start getting enforced in two days, a new windfall of money coming in.

456
00:37:13,575 --> 00:37:15,296
[SPEAKER_06]: This isn't going to hurt our bond rating.

457
00:37:15,597 --> 00:37:16,838
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually going to increase it.

458
00:37:17,158 --> 00:37:21,321
[SPEAKER_06]: We can make Medford with a new casino coming in and all sorts of jobs.

459
00:37:21,381 --> 00:37:23,123
[SPEAKER_06]: People are going to be looking for a place to live.

460
00:37:23,483 --> 00:37:25,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Now is the time for this city council to act.

461
00:37:25,925 --> 00:37:28,046
[SPEAKER_06]: We already have the account set up.

462
00:37:28,106 --> 00:37:33,150
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really think we need a new account to be set up, but what we could do is reduce property rates.

463
00:37:33,431 --> 00:37:36,813
[SPEAKER_06]: What we could do, property tax rates, that is, excuse me.

464
00:37:37,514 --> 00:37:39,575
[SPEAKER_06]: What else we could do is reduce business fees.

465
00:37:40,116 --> 00:37:41,237
[SPEAKER_06]: Massachusetts requires,

466
00:37:41,918 --> 00:37:50,640
[SPEAKER_06]: each town and city to establish an excise tax, but there's nothing stopping us from setting that excise tax rate to zero.

467
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:59,401
[SPEAKER_06]: We can make Medford one of the most attractive cities to move to in the Bay State with a new casino coming in and job prospects.

468
00:38:01,102 --> 00:38:06,283
[SPEAKER_06]: There was an article a few weeks ago how all cities and towns across the Bay State are trying to be the new Somerville.

469
00:38:06,603 --> 00:38:08,063
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to see the next article.

470
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:11,572
[SPEAKER_06]: come to say, let's try to be the new Medford.

471
00:38:11,693 --> 00:38:14,735
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope you'll take into account what I've said, and thank you for your time.

472
00:38:14,915 --> 00:38:16,096
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. Capucci.

473
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:24,683
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a motion for approval as amended by Councilor Camuso, as amended by Councilors Camuso and Penta.

474
00:38:25,043 --> 00:38:26,284
[SPEAKER_14]: Roll call has been requested.

475
00:38:26,344 --> 00:38:28,786
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

476
00:38:32,429 --> 00:38:34,831
[SPEAKER_05]: Could the clerk read the motion out loud, please, as amended?

477
00:38:44,575 --> 00:38:58,419
[SPEAKER_15]: to establish a long-term stabilization fund to offset any major projects such as the police station in the future, amended by Councilor Camuso to strike police station from the main motion.

478
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:05,101
[SPEAKER_15]: And Councilor Pentez to establish the stabilization fund

479
00:39:10,667 --> 00:39:19,969
[SPEAKER_15]: for purposes of, uh, missile buildings, uh, and so on and, uh, uh, and provide a dollar amount, uh, towards this.

480
00:39:20,289 --> 00:39:23,729
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, it's not, no, no, that wasn't what I said.

481
00:39:23,749 --> 00:39:33,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Went to a committee, the whole meeting, you know, it's all, why don't you just refer to a committee that passed the main motion and delete as a police station and refer it to the committee, the whole meeting of the council come up with a criteria.

482
00:39:33,991 --> 00:39:34,671
[SPEAKER_05]: So moved.

483
00:39:35,271 --> 00:39:35,571
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

484
00:39:37,112 --> 00:39:38,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Your motion minusing out the police station.

485
00:39:39,382 --> 00:39:41,283
[SPEAKER_05]: and we're referring it to what can be the whole.

486
00:39:41,563 --> 00:39:42,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

487
00:39:42,143 --> 00:39:42,383
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

488
00:39:44,364 --> 00:39:46,165
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight, we're all on the same page.

489
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:51,367
[SPEAKER_11]: Be it resolved the city of Medford established a long-term stabilization fund to help offset any major projects.

490
00:39:51,867 --> 00:39:56,989
[SPEAKER_11]: Upon passage of the resolution, a committee of the whole be established with officials from the administration to discuss the funding thereof.

491
00:39:57,409 --> 00:39:57,829
[SPEAKER_11]: Perfect.

492
00:39:57,929 --> 00:40:00,070
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

493
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:05,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Also in the meantime, Council Max, he wanted to find out if in fact you're going to report back to us.

494
00:40:05,883 --> 00:40:07,983
[SPEAKER_05]: If there already is an established stabilization account.

495
00:40:08,003 --> 00:40:10,484
[SPEAKER_05]: The clerk will report back to us.

496
00:40:10,664 --> 00:40:12,885
[SPEAKER_15]: If there's an account.

497
00:40:13,405 --> 00:40:13,765
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

498
00:40:13,785 --> 00:40:14,305
[SPEAKER_15]: It's an amendment.

499
00:40:14,325 --> 00:40:16,085
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll probably get referred to the auditor.

500
00:40:16,525 --> 00:40:17,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we make that a B paper?

501
00:40:18,286 --> 00:40:19,806
[SPEAKER_15]: Make that part of the amendment.

502
00:40:23,507 --> 00:40:23,707
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

503
00:40:24,127 --> 00:40:24,327
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

504
00:40:24,907 --> 00:40:25,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Make that part of the paper.

505
00:40:26,187 --> 00:40:28,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well, what if I don't want to vote for the paper, but I want to vote for the B paper?

506
00:40:29,108 --> 00:40:29,448
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

507
00:40:29,628 --> 00:40:31,609
[SPEAKER_14]: Or you can sever the amendment.

508
00:40:31,709 --> 00:40:32,589
[SPEAKER_03]: Sever the motion, please.

509
00:40:32,609 --> 00:40:33,269
[SPEAKER_14]: Sever the motion.

510
00:40:33,918 --> 00:40:35,039
[SPEAKER_14]: So we'll have a separate motion.

511
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:36,580
[SPEAKER_14]: So the second, second one comes first.

512
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:36,940
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

513
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:49,209
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motion of a council Longo Kern that the city clerk, uh, after consultation with the proper bodies report back to the city council regarding the previous establishment of a, such a fund.

514
00:40:49,909 --> 00:40:55,873
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor, all those opposed motion passes onto the main motion as amended.

[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Kern?

521
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:04,536

[SPEAKER_14]: Would the petitioner please come forward and state your name and address for the record.

[SPEAKER_07]: Michael Del Signore, 16 Marshall Street, Medford.

535
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:06,170
[SPEAKER_14]: Del Signore, we have the Chairman of the Licensing Committee, Counselor Caraviello.

536
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:08,010
[SPEAKER_14]: How do you find this application?

537
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:12,671
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, I have reviewed the papers and I find them in order, and I motion for approval.

538
00:42:14,192 --> 00:42:22,234
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of approval of Counselor Caraviello, and seconded by Counselor Camuso, tell us a little bit about your establishment.

539
00:42:23,154 --> 00:42:24,855
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to be a deli.

540
00:42:24,915 --> 00:42:28,476
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to feature some pasta dishes and takeout dinners.

541
00:42:29,121 --> 00:42:30,922
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to expand on the current concept.

542
00:42:31,022 --> 00:42:31,802
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the Medfidelli.

543
00:42:31,822 --> 00:42:33,282
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if anyone's familiar with it.

544
00:42:33,442 --> 00:42:42,125
[SPEAKER_07]: But keep their core and just expand it a little bit to add some more offerings for dinner time rather than just the sandwiches.

545
00:42:43,846 --> 00:42:44,346
[SPEAKER_14]: All the best.

546
00:42:44,406 --> 00:42:44,786
[SPEAKER_14]: Good luck.

547
00:42:45,226 --> 00:42:46,067
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

548
00:42:46,607 --> 00:42:46,767
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

549
00:42:46,927 --> 00:42:47,647
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

550
00:42:47,667 --> 00:42:49,608
[SPEAKER_14]: Your license is granted.

551
00:42:49,748 --> 00:42:50,268
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Council.

552
00:42:55,739 --> 00:43:00,183
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion to revert back to the regular order of business by Councilor Camuso.

553
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:00,943
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

554
00:43:01,204 --> 00:43:01,904
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

555
00:43:02,625 --> 00:43:06,888
[SPEAKER_14]: Item number 15-009 offered by Councilor Penta.

556
00:43:07,709 --> 00:43:19,098
[SPEAKER_14]: Be it resolved that a continuing of last week's public comments regarding the mayor's new pay to park revenue enhancement program be discussed.

557
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:20,520
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Penta.

558
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, last week we had a four hour

559
00:43:23,903 --> 00:43:30,286
[SPEAKER_05]: marathon discussion as it related to the mayor's new pay to park enhancement program here in the city of Medford.

560
00:43:30,827 --> 00:43:40,011
[SPEAKER_05]: And as we all know, there was a full host of folks here, approximately 50 people who were involved, who had a personal interest in this particular program, came.

561
00:43:40,051 --> 00:43:40,731
[SPEAKER_05]: Many of them spoke.

562
00:43:41,032 --> 00:43:43,053
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people came to listen as to what was going on.

563
00:43:43,733 --> 00:43:46,634
[SPEAKER_05]: As a result of that, there were many concerns that were brought up.

564
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:53,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, I don't think the local press has been able to pick up on all of it yet and their commentaries.

565
00:43:54,123 --> 00:43:55,163
[SPEAKER_05]: That's neither here or there.

566
00:43:55,983 --> 00:43:59,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Some concerns from last week to this week have developed.

567
00:43:59,944 --> 00:44:06,825
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know the chief of police is here, and I know there was some continuation of changes that took place at the traffic commission today.

568
00:44:07,185 --> 00:44:12,466
[SPEAKER_05]: But I have some particular issues since last week till now that I would like to bring up.

569
00:44:12,946 --> 00:44:21,668
[SPEAKER_05]: The first one is the fact that this was supposed to be a major program here in the city of Medford, a major development

570
00:44:22,038 --> 00:44:24,460
[SPEAKER_05]: that would have an impact on the taxpayers of this community.

571
00:44:25,261 --> 00:44:29,184
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you'll notice very nicely, there was no ribbon cutting ceremony for this one.

572
00:44:29,524 --> 00:44:37,511
[SPEAKER_05]: You didn't see a whole host of people coming out into the city while the mayor cut the ribbon for this wonderful new tax me to death program.

573
00:44:37,871 --> 00:44:39,933
[SPEAKER_05]: You didn't see that, and you won't see it either.

574
00:44:40,733 --> 00:44:49,060
[SPEAKER_05]: And last week, Mr. Chief, when you were here, two particular locations, one in West Method on High Street in front of a couple of residential homes,

575
00:44:49,544 --> 00:44:54,147
[SPEAKER_05]: And on Boston Avenue, in front of a bunch of residential homes, those kiosks are still there.

576
00:44:54,647 --> 00:44:56,308
[SPEAKER_05]: And the 15th is two days away.

577
00:44:57,088 --> 00:45:09,475
[SPEAKER_05]: And if I understood everybody's comments last week, not only yours, but also the folks from Republic, they indicated that those were going to be taken away and removed because they were misplaced or whatever it might be.

578
00:45:10,496 --> 00:45:18,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Thirdly, talking about the location where you go to get your parking permit.

579
00:45:18,947 --> 00:45:37,273
[SPEAKER_05]: As of yesterday, from folks that I have spoken to, maybe it came in today's mail, but people who sent their applications in on the 1st of January, or the first week of January, looking for their resident parking permit, they have still to get in the mail the two passes for guests, whoever it might be, coming to their homes.

580
00:45:37,974 --> 00:45:40,234
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, when they went to pay, they didn't get a receipt.

581
00:45:40,294 --> 00:45:43,776
[SPEAKER_05]: So if any of you folks out there did pay, didn't get a receipt, so be it.

582
00:45:44,156 --> 00:45:47,677
[SPEAKER_05]: But for the two particular folks from both parts of the city that went there,

583
00:45:48,462 --> 00:45:50,602
[SPEAKER_05]: They went out there, and they got no receipt.

584
00:45:52,003 --> 00:45:56,483
[SPEAKER_05]: A major concern is if it's not here in City Hall anymore.

585
00:45:56,803 --> 00:46:00,044
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't come to City Hall and buy your resident parking permit.

586
00:46:00,324 --> 00:46:03,385
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to go to the spot on Main Street on the Somerville Line.

587
00:46:04,265 --> 00:46:09,206
[SPEAKER_05]: And to do that, you have to pay $10, same thing that you would have paid here in City Hall.

588
00:46:10,186 --> 00:46:16,867
[SPEAKER_05]: But they're telling you, if you have a smartphone or whatever, or your computer, you can go online, and you can get it that way.

589
00:46:17,387 --> 00:46:17,847
[SPEAKER_05]: But of course,

590
00:46:18,368 --> 00:46:20,229
[SPEAKER_05]: They extort another 30% out of you.

591
00:46:20,609 --> 00:46:22,729
[SPEAKER_05]: They charge you $3 more to do it that way.

592
00:46:23,329 --> 00:46:29,711
[SPEAKER_05]: So by doing it that way, they're making another 30% on the fact that you're a resident of this community.

593
00:46:29,751 --> 00:46:33,492
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to get a resident parking sticker for where you park, where you pay taxes.

594
00:46:33,852 --> 00:46:37,493
[SPEAKER_05]: And now they want to charge you 30% for the sticker that normally costs 10%.

595
00:46:38,694 --> 00:46:43,175
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, a validation program was brought to our attention last week.

596
00:46:43,815 --> 00:46:47,276
[SPEAKER_05]: And it started off by addressing certain hairdressers in this community.

597
00:46:47,945 --> 00:46:50,368
[SPEAKER_05]: One in particular in the West Medford area.

598
00:46:50,889 --> 00:46:56,856
[SPEAKER_05]: And as a result of that, as we all know, a lot of these hairdressers have senior citizens and maybe younger folks.

599
00:46:57,376 --> 00:47:02,702
[SPEAKER_05]: But a majority of the senior citizens that come there, they have a two or three hour window to do what they have to do.

600
00:47:03,724 --> 00:47:07,408
[SPEAKER_05]: So the questions become, as I'm going around to six of them now I've gone to,

601
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:11,533
[SPEAKER_05]: And as I go to them, I mean, what are they supposed to do, get them off the chair, run outside?

602
00:47:11,573 --> 00:47:14,676
[SPEAKER_05]: They can't move the car because you only can stay there for two hours.

603
00:47:15,316 --> 00:47:29,828
[SPEAKER_05]: But they want to know how a particular hairdresser in a particular part of this community can get a special validation program so that person can give out numbers and number plates to the Republic people so on a particular day,

604
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:31,751
[SPEAKER_05]: They won't tag those people.

605
00:47:31,791 --> 00:47:34,272
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, this is absolute insanity on a particular day.

606
00:47:34,292 --> 00:47:34,753
[SPEAKER_05]: What are we going to do?

607
00:47:35,133 --> 00:47:37,114
[SPEAKER_05]: Play this game one day, one day at a time?

608
00:47:37,654 --> 00:47:40,036
[SPEAKER_05]: Let one hairdresser know and another hairdresser not know?

609
00:47:40,356 --> 00:47:42,177
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no fairness to that part of the program.

610
00:47:43,398 --> 00:47:57,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, nothing has been presented to us that tells us there is a statutory law that allows a private for-profit out-of-state company to issue parking citations, which has historically been a police department job.

611
00:47:58,187 --> 00:47:58,948
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a big issue.

612
00:48:00,208 --> 00:48:02,029
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know, Chief, you may not have the answer for that.

613
00:48:02,709 --> 00:48:03,430
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'll tell you this.

614
00:48:04,491 --> 00:48:15,817
[SPEAKER_05]: If you do have the answer for that, then I think what you need to have presented before here is that your Metro Police Department took a vote to give up that part of their job to a private nonprofit out-of-state company.

615
00:48:16,338 --> 00:48:22,261
[SPEAKER_05]: People want to know that, and I want to know that, too, because that's a huge issue in this whole program.

616
00:48:23,102 --> 00:48:26,924
[SPEAKER_05]: Last week, it was Councilor Knight who brought up the issue of the signs in the city.

617
00:48:27,464 --> 00:48:28,685
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a contract that says,

618
00:48:29,287 --> 00:48:31,409
[SPEAKER_05]: Republic will replace and paint the signs.

619
00:48:32,270 --> 00:48:33,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Rightfully so.

620
00:48:33,411 --> 00:48:36,493
[SPEAKER_05]: It's part of the job that the Medford highway department have.

621
00:48:37,134 --> 00:48:46,162
[SPEAKER_05]: And if the mayor abdicated that responsibility away from the highway department, then he violated his own contract with his own employees here in the city of Medford.

622
00:48:46,602 --> 00:48:47,663
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's as clear as the bell.

623
00:48:48,203 --> 00:48:52,347
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it's in a section three of the RFP that went out this past spring.

624
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:55,874
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are a few issues that are going on.

625
00:48:55,894 --> 00:48:57,115
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not a poor community.

626
00:48:57,435 --> 00:48:59,276
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the funny part about this thing.

627
00:48:59,837 --> 00:49:06,581
[SPEAKER_05]: You're sitting on huge surpluses of money, $7 million in free cash, $8.5 million in water and sewer, and just on the water and sewer account.

628
00:49:06,962 --> 00:49:20,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Your water and sewer account bills just went up, and you're sitting on $8.5 million of your money that you keep paying more and more in each and every year, whether you have a stabilization account, a surplus account, whatever it might be, or your real estate account.

629
00:49:20,531 --> 00:49:21,492
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a program.

630
00:49:22,117 --> 00:49:31,400
[SPEAKER_05]: that had absolutely no thought process generated out to the entire community, never mind the business people, but the taxpayers of this community.

631
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:46,064
[SPEAKER_05]: This past Saturday, if you drove through Medford Square, as I did, and I walked through it, and you go through the downtown areas of West Medford and South Medford and North Medford, and you will start to see people not going into these stores.

632
00:49:46,084 --> 00:49:47,805
[SPEAKER_05]: So I go and ask some of these proprietors, why?

633
00:49:47,825 --> 00:49:51,666
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they're not going to go in there for five minutes, go in there to pick up a cup of coffee,

634
00:49:51,968 --> 00:49:53,969
[SPEAKER_05]: or get a sandwich and put $0.25 in it.

635
00:49:54,149 --> 00:49:59,911
[SPEAKER_05]: And if they can't get a spot there, they have to go look for a, what do you call it, a kiosk.

636
00:49:59,931 --> 00:50:06,033
[SPEAKER_05]: And by the time they go to the kiosk and come back, and if they use a smartphone, pay $0.35 to put $0.25 into the machine.

637
00:50:06,514 --> 00:50:08,694
[SPEAKER_05]: So now you're up to $0.60 for 15 minutes.

638
00:50:09,735 --> 00:50:10,855
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes no sense at all.

639
00:50:11,515 --> 00:50:12,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Republic comes from Tennessee.

640
00:50:13,256 --> 00:50:15,797
[SPEAKER_05]: They're here for only one reason, and that's to make money.

641
00:50:16,297 --> 00:50:17,078
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not your friend.

642
00:50:17,258 --> 00:50:18,078
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not our friend.

643
00:50:18,458 --> 00:50:21,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Their only friend is your money that you put into that machine.

644
00:50:21,522 --> 00:50:22,263
[SPEAKER_05]: So good luck to them.

645
00:50:22,584 --> 00:50:23,345
[SPEAKER_05]: They won the bid.

646
00:50:23,565 --> 00:50:24,707
[SPEAKER_05]: The mayor won the bid with him.

647
00:50:25,623 --> 00:50:39,870
[SPEAKER_05]: But the other part of the program is, if you're all going to be treated equally, then everyone that works in this city, in this building, the fire department, police department, school department, your parking spot that you get in this city is what you consider a perk.

648
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:41,351
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't go with your job.

649
00:50:41,991 --> 00:50:48,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, he's opened up Pandora's box because there's an IRS rule and regulation that allows a perk.

650
00:50:49,674 --> 00:50:54,497
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're getting a perk on your job, which is parking, there's a cost factor that goes along with that.

651
00:50:55,192 --> 00:51:00,854
[SPEAKER_05]: And right now, as of the IRS rule and regulation as of 2014, it's up to $250 a month.

652
00:51:01,555 --> 00:51:05,036
[SPEAKER_05]: And the crazy part about the whole story is up to $250 a month.

653
00:51:05,476 --> 00:51:14,320
[SPEAKER_05]: So if an employee in this building comes here, we're now going to have to figure out what is the value of that free parking spot that they get here on this piece of property.

654
00:51:15,182 --> 00:51:19,887
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you take a train or a bus to Boston every day, you get $130 a month.

655
00:51:20,727 --> 00:51:35,742
[SPEAKER_05]: So where's the logic in between there of wanting to take cars off the road and use public transportation when they're giving you a higher perk for your job to park your car on an employer's location, which is the city of Medford, as compared to taking a train from the private industry?

656
00:51:37,032 --> 00:51:38,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are some of my comments right now.

657
00:51:40,276 --> 00:51:45,383
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, this is just so hard to understand.

658
00:51:45,403 --> 00:51:50,611
[SPEAKER_05]: And the poor part, the hard part about it is, you know, I know every business wants to make a go of it.

659
00:51:51,447 --> 00:51:56,668
[SPEAKER_05]: But you can't have competition in one part of the city and not be addressed the same way equally in another part.

660
00:51:56,688 --> 00:52:06,410
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't go to a market in one part of the city, and you can sit there all day long and go to another part of the city and go to a convenience store, and you get a 15, 30-minute parking spot.

661
00:52:07,070 --> 00:52:16,052
[SPEAKER_05]: As I said to you last week, Chief, with all due respect, in South Medford, you have 15 minutes, you have 30 minutes, you have one hour and two-hour parking, all in the same block of stores.

662
00:52:16,412 --> 00:52:20,133
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, that's hard to understand, and if you're going to try to treat everyone the same.

663
00:52:22,053 --> 00:52:25,656
[SPEAKER_05]: Last week, one of the things that did resonate, I will tell you this, it's dark out right now.

664
00:52:25,716 --> 00:52:37,385
[SPEAKER_05]: You go outside after 4.30, 5 o'clock at night, and you're driving down the street, and you're not used to what a kiosk is, or you can't find it, you can't see it, or the weather isn't clement, or whatever it might be, and there's snow.

665
00:52:38,426 --> 00:52:47,813
[SPEAKER_05]: Either you're going to lose the customer, or they're not going to find the kiosk and get tagged, or more importantly, the city's going to have an obligation, because in your RFP in there,

666
00:52:48,490 --> 00:52:59,936
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe the question was asked, I think it was you, Counselor Carviel, asked the question, when it snows out, who is gonna be the responsible party to make sure that those kiosks are clean on the sidewalk for somebody to get to?

667
00:53:00,937 --> 00:53:08,721
[SPEAKER_05]: So those are some of my initial comments, Chief, and as I said to you again, this is the Chief of Police, and I happen to like him, and he's my friend, okay?

668
00:53:08,921 --> 00:53:10,642
[SPEAKER_05]: But he doesn't deserve to be up here.

669
00:53:10,862 --> 00:53:12,142
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not his program.

670
00:53:12,403 --> 00:53:13,903
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Mayor Michael McGlynn's program.

671
00:53:14,303 --> 00:53:16,745
[SPEAKER_05]: He's the one that should be here answering the questions,

672
00:53:17,543 --> 00:53:20,624
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know you're doing the job for him, Chief, but I just think it's unfair.

673
00:53:20,644 --> 00:53:22,865
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just my opinion, and I'm saying it publicly.

674
00:53:23,065 --> 00:53:24,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Penta.

675
00:53:24,646 --> 00:53:30,548
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to allow the Chief now to address us.

676
00:53:30,588 --> 00:53:46,974
[SPEAKER_14]: There have been some further developments vis-a-vis a meeting of the Parking Commission and Traffic Commission today that I think the Chief may be sharing with us, as well as clarifying any of the items so politely brought up by Councilor Penta.

677
00:53:47,817 --> 00:53:48,778
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

678
00:53:48,858 --> 00:53:51,299
[SPEAKER_09]: Leo Sacco, police chief here in the city of Medford.

679
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:53,781
[SPEAKER_09]: I live at 227 Elm Street in Medford.

680
00:53:54,882 --> 00:53:59,125
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to bounce around some of the issues that Councilor Penta brought up.

681
00:53:59,405 --> 00:54:07,551
[SPEAKER_09]: And the main one that's of concern was the issuance of the parking citations by a private company.

682
00:54:08,211 --> 00:54:16,517
[SPEAKER_09]: That was a matter that was negotiated with both police unions, the Medford Police Patrolman's Association and the Medford Police Superior Officers Association.

683
00:54:17,776 --> 00:54:20,878
[SPEAKER_09]: in the year 2013, when the contract was settled.

684
00:54:24,061 --> 00:54:26,782
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not that the police officers gave up any work.

685
00:54:27,243 --> 00:54:28,344
[SPEAKER_09]: This is shared work.

686
00:54:29,124 --> 00:54:31,526
[SPEAKER_09]: So police officers can still issue citations.

687
00:54:32,126 --> 00:54:33,948
[SPEAKER_09]: That job has not been taken away from them.

688
00:54:34,768 --> 00:54:38,531
[SPEAKER_09]: This program has been put in place to augment the police officers' work in the field.

689
00:54:39,411 --> 00:54:40,792
[SPEAKER_09]: So it hasn't been taken away.

690
00:54:40,832 --> 00:54:42,634
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not something that they've lost.

691
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:45,456
[SPEAKER_09]: They bargained, and bargained in good faith,

692
00:54:46,462 --> 00:54:48,383
[SPEAKER_09]: And it will augment their duties.

693
00:54:48,543 --> 00:54:52,725
[SPEAKER_09]: And we know what's happened over the years with the numbers of personnel dropping.

694
00:54:53,346 --> 00:54:58,508
[SPEAKER_09]: We've not been able to keep pace with all of permit parking situations, the time limit enforcement.

695
00:54:58,929 --> 00:55:01,650
[SPEAKER_09]: There's always another demand on the police officers' time.

696
00:55:02,430 --> 00:55:05,172
[SPEAKER_09]: Would it be great if we could have hired another 20 officers?

697
00:55:05,632 --> 00:55:07,273
[SPEAKER_09]: That certainly would have been.

698
00:55:07,673 --> 00:55:12,756
[SPEAKER_09]: But could I guarantee that we would have consistent, steady parking enforcement?

699
00:55:13,596 --> 00:55:15,057
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I wouldn't be able to do that.

700
00:55:16,450 --> 00:55:19,533
[SPEAKER_09]: because there are always some other obligations.

701
00:55:21,095 --> 00:55:27,321
[SPEAKER_09]: Going back on some of the other issues, yes, we did speak about those meters or kiosks in front of the homes.

702
00:55:27,822 --> 00:55:30,885
[SPEAKER_09]: The one on High Street was answered last week, 418 High Street.

703
00:55:31,365 --> 00:55:38,613
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe that kiosk, the one at 418 High Street in West Medford, in front of a home, I believe that is scheduled to be removed.

704
00:55:38,733 --> 00:55:39,874
[SPEAKER_05]: There's just two of them in front of them.

705
00:55:41,028 --> 00:55:43,550
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one in front of the apartment building and one in front of the two family house.

706
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:47,232
[SPEAKER_09]: The apartment building is right next to the Brookline bank.

707
00:55:48,173 --> 00:55:50,835
[SPEAKER_09]: The apartment building has off street parking for its tenants.

708
00:55:51,595 --> 00:55:59,541
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe that one would stay, but this, the, I believe it's a single or two family home at 418 is scheduled to be removed.

709
00:56:00,601 --> 00:56:08,787
[SPEAKER_09]: I've looked at the meters of the kiosks on Boston Avenue between university or just before universe, just before Bellevue.

710
00:56:09,887 --> 00:56:19,974
[SPEAKER_09]: Coming from Winthrop Street, just before Bellevue, there's two homes, and then there's several homes between Bellevue and Fairmont, and then Fairmont to University.

711
00:56:19,994 --> 00:56:24,618
[SPEAKER_09]: In the Fairmont to University stretch, there's a bus stop and a driveway.

712
00:56:25,078 --> 00:56:27,260
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't believe there's a parking spot that's lost.

713
00:56:28,341 --> 00:56:33,304
[SPEAKER_09]: Between Fairmont and Bellevue, there's another large driveway.

714
00:56:34,385 --> 00:56:35,606
[SPEAKER_09]: There may be one spot.

715
00:56:36,252 --> 00:56:44,696
[SPEAKER_09]: And then from Bellevue going further up on Boston Ave towards Winthrop, there's probably two or three spaces there.

716
00:56:45,456 --> 00:56:59,323
[SPEAKER_09]: The problem with that is actually in front of that home, when the meters were removed in the early 1980s, there's still a pole in the ground that shows that there was a meter in front of that home back in that day, when we had meters in the past.

717
00:57:00,504 --> 00:57:04,946
[SPEAKER_09]: That is a very busy location for the businesses on the hillside.

718
00:57:05,892 --> 00:57:07,814
[SPEAKER_09]: the auto body shop, the Dunkin' Donuts.

719
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:12,618
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no guarantee that the residents in that home would be able to park there.

720
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:18,163
[SPEAKER_09]: I've spoken with Mr. Nash, who's present with me this evening, from Republic Parking.

721
00:57:19,104 --> 00:57:29,253
[SPEAKER_09]: We spoke earlier about the possibility of registering those plates of those residents that live in that home, so if they are parked there, they would not have to pay the meter.

722
00:57:30,214 --> 00:57:31,175
[SPEAKER_09]: They would be okay.

723
00:57:31,215 --> 00:57:32,476
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's a work in progress.

724
00:57:33,064 --> 00:57:41,169
[SPEAKER_09]: I would strongly recommend not eliminating those spots from the meter program until we see what the demand is, what the level of demand is.

725
00:57:41,689 --> 00:57:47,213
[SPEAKER_09]: If it shows that it's going to be open on most days, then we'd probably consider removing it at that time.

726
00:57:47,913 --> 00:57:54,858
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's beyond me to be able to say removing anything only because we can't violate some contractual obligations.

727
00:57:54,918 --> 00:57:58,540
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's something that I would have to research with the city solicitor.

728
00:58:00,475 --> 00:58:02,417
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's not like those have not been addressed.

729
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:06,000
[SPEAKER_09]: Those have been looked at and been taken into consideration.

730
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:11,404
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're going to look to see what we can do about correcting the problem that's there.

731
00:58:11,464 --> 00:58:13,325
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's not as big as it appeared.

732
00:58:17,169 --> 00:58:18,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go back to West Memphis.

733
00:58:18,490 --> 00:58:20,732
[SPEAKER_05]: You said 418 High Street, where the residents are.

734
00:58:21,112 --> 00:58:28,658
[SPEAKER_05]: But you can go right across the street, and there's a kiosk that's in front of a house that's residential on the top floor, a dentist off on the bottom,

735
00:58:28,988 --> 00:58:31,350
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's two residential there, and then there's a funeral home.

736
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:33,431
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's one before the funeral home, and there's one after.

737
00:58:34,132 --> 00:58:35,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, we won't get into naming other funeral homes.

738
00:58:36,493 --> 00:58:37,834
[SPEAKER_05]: There's other funeral homes that have nothing.

739
00:58:38,375 --> 00:58:39,415
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can park there all day.

740
00:58:39,615 --> 00:58:40,476
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, how does this work?

741
00:58:41,537 --> 00:58:44,199
[SPEAKER_09]: We've gone over that past several meetings.

742
00:58:44,259 --> 00:58:45,540
[SPEAKER_18]: Point of information, Mr. President?

743
00:58:50,303 --> 00:58:57,568
[SPEAKER_18]: On this particular matter, I know it's, I want to choose my words carefully here.

744
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:08,884
[SPEAKER_18]: If the council wants to expand the program to bakeries and sub shops and other businesses, then bring the motion forward and I'm sure that people will support it.

745
00:59:09,464 --> 00:59:22,388
[SPEAKER_18]: But just to start talking about this business, that business and stuff, I just think it's unfair because if you want to expand the program, bring it forward if you think there's some inequities out there.

746
00:59:22,628 --> 00:59:25,209
[SPEAKER_18]: But just to throw generalities out there, no one knows what you're talking about.

747
00:59:26,005 --> 00:59:27,226
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not talking about generalities.

748
00:59:27,266 --> 00:59:34,189
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the chief knows what I'm talking about, and I think Mr. Nash knows what I'm talking about, because we've had this discussion before, and nothing has changed.

749
00:59:34,789 --> 00:59:36,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing has changed for the locations.

750
00:59:37,051 --> 00:59:41,913
[SPEAKER_05]: And as a result of that, we're taking a like subject matter, a funeral home.

751
00:59:42,613 --> 00:59:45,655
[SPEAKER_05]: How come in one part of the city there's nothing and another part of the city there is?

752
00:59:45,935 --> 00:59:48,276
[SPEAKER_05]: We can go to convenience stores and do the same argument.

753
00:59:48,436 --> 00:59:49,717
[SPEAKER_05]: We've already done it with hairdressers.

754
00:59:50,357 --> 00:59:54,359
[SPEAKER_09]: It goes back to the original report that was done, which was not Republic's report.

755
00:59:54,399 --> 00:59:55,420
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a report that was done

756
00:59:55,843 --> 00:59:59,745
[SPEAKER_09]: for the city to put the RFP on the street to get bids.

757
01:00:00,165 --> 01:00:02,547
[SPEAKER_09]: And based on that report, that was what was in there.

758
01:00:02,587 --> 01:00:03,808
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what it contained.

759
01:00:03,888 --> 01:00:07,350
[SPEAKER_09]: As I stated several times, this is built to grow.

760
01:00:07,550 --> 01:00:09,090
[SPEAKER_05]: But who checked the report?

761
01:00:09,311 --> 01:00:11,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Why would you put something in front of a residential home?

762
01:00:11,352 --> 01:00:12,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's the logic to that?

763
01:00:14,193 --> 01:00:14,894
[SPEAKER_09]: It does happen.

764
01:00:14,934 --> 01:00:21,798
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, there are occasions, because during the course of the daytime, the residents in that home are not there.

765
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:25,882
[SPEAKER_09]: people are in the business district parking in front of those homes.

766
01:00:26,242 --> 01:00:28,523
[SPEAKER_09]: That's also a location that we have a problem with.

767
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:33,806
[SPEAKER_09]: People would park, walk down the street and get on the commuter rail and be gone all day and tie up all of high street.

768
01:00:34,447 --> 01:00:40,090
[SPEAKER_09]: We're making modifications in those various areas right now to make them both a business permit and a time limit.

769
01:00:40,210 --> 01:00:44,673
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you don't have the business permit, you're stuck with a time limit.

770
01:00:45,433 --> 01:00:52,137
[SPEAKER_09]: If you have a business permit, you'd be able to park there because the residents are gone during the daytime, during the course of the time,

771
01:00:52,523 --> 01:00:54,684
[SPEAKER_09]: that those meters or kiosks would be in effect.

772
01:00:55,144 --> 01:00:56,905
[SPEAKER_09]: The residents are gone from those homes.

773
01:00:56,945 --> 01:00:58,305
[SPEAKER_09]: They are not using those spaces.

774
01:00:58,585 --> 01:01:02,967
[SPEAKER_09]: Those spaces are being occupied by, today, being occupied by commuters.

775
01:01:04,468 --> 01:01:12,051
[SPEAKER_09]: On the 15th, they'll be occupied by people that are visiting the square or people who work in the square who are validly permitted to be there.

776
01:01:12,071 --> 01:01:15,312
[SPEAKER_09]: And they'll be gone when the residents come home at the end of the day.

777
01:01:18,574 --> 01:01:19,274
[SPEAKER_05]: I hear what you're saying.

778
01:01:20,282 --> 01:01:25,706
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you justify, if the contract was signed on October 10th, and this is now January, what, 13th?

779
01:01:26,306 --> 01:01:27,187
[SPEAKER_05]: They had three months.

780
01:01:27,707 --> 01:01:31,610
[SPEAKER_05]: They had three months to look at all these locations and saying, hey, wait a minute, this doesn't make any sense.

781
01:01:32,170 --> 01:01:33,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Why would you put something here in front of a house?

782
01:01:34,312 --> 01:01:38,415
[SPEAKER_05]: How would you take one business and put it in front of one business and not another business?

783
01:01:38,675 --> 01:01:40,196
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I think you made the comment last week.

784
01:01:40,656 --> 01:01:41,956
[SPEAKER_05]: that this is just the beginning.

785
01:01:41,996 --> 01:01:44,117
[SPEAKER_05]: There's going to be more to come as it relates to this.

786
01:01:44,337 --> 01:01:48,718
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if this is just the beginning now, what's going to happen when you start hitting all these other locations?

787
01:01:49,099 --> 01:01:53,680
[SPEAKER_05]: You can go from Salem Street, outside of Salem Street, all the way down to Medford Square, and there's nothing.

788
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:55,921
[SPEAKER_05]: There's nothing on the streets there.

789
01:01:57,461 --> 01:01:58,301
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's not fair.

790
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:00,822
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't say that it would be growing by leaps and bounds.

791
01:02:01,022 --> 01:02:02,583
[SPEAKER_09]: It may grow based on the demand.

792
01:02:02,623 --> 01:02:07,224
[SPEAKER_09]: We know what's going to happen when we have the enforcement, and that's in the restricted areas.

793
01:02:08,292 --> 01:02:09,753
[SPEAKER_09]: you're going to push the problem elsewhere.

794
01:02:09,913 --> 01:02:18,676
[SPEAKER_09]: So it is going to create some, you know, some other needs for us to correct, whether it be just time limit enforcement or meters or kiosks.

795
01:02:20,176 --> 01:02:27,879
[SPEAKER_09]: But the plan was developed to call for a certain number of kiosks, call for a certain number of single head and double head meters.

796
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:30,740
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's what's in place today.

797
01:02:31,141 --> 01:02:35,942
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're really not going to know the impact until it's up and running and it be modified from there.

798
01:02:37,323 --> 01:02:37,743
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, chief.

799
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:38,941
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Camuso.

800
01:02:39,281 --> 01:02:39,501
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

801
01:02:39,521 --> 01:02:40,742
[SPEAKER_18]: A couple of questions for the chief.

802
01:02:40,802 --> 01:02:43,043
[SPEAKER_18]: And then, uh, I actually have a statement I want to make.

803
01:02:43,063 --> 01:02:48,407
[SPEAKER_18]: We got in this pocket program, but first, um, the outcome of the handicap parking, did you get to the bottom of that?

804
01:02:48,447 --> 01:02:48,727
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

805
01:02:49,067 --> 01:02:50,268
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, chapter 40, section 22.

806
01:02:50,768 --> 01:02:53,030
[SPEAKER_09]: I called councilor Karen Viola last week.

807
01:02:53,050 --> 01:02:57,633
[SPEAKER_09]: It was his question to me, chapter 40, section 22 and chapter 40, section 22.

808
01:02:58,273 --> 01:03:06,759
[SPEAKER_09]: A allows person who has a handicap plate, placard or disabled veteran plate to park in,

809
01:03:07,421 --> 01:03:19,967
[SPEAKER_09]: any spot on any public street, uh, for any length of time and not have to pay for the legal spot in front of a hydrant or intersections.

810
01:03:20,367 --> 01:03:22,068
[SPEAKER_09]: It has to be an illegal parking space.

811
01:03:22,268 --> 01:03:22,728
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

812
01:03:23,068 --> 01:03:23,348
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

813
01:03:23,449 --> 01:03:27,370
[SPEAKER_09]: And not 20 feet from the car or within beyond the 20 feet from the chief.

814
01:03:27,691 --> 01:03:35,034
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, just to follow up, um, this was something that, uh, today I, I saw a child almost get hit by a vehicle today.

815
01:03:35,627 --> 01:03:42,432
[SPEAKER_18]: at the corner of Playstead Road and High Street, there's a vehicle that parks there every day with a handicapped plate in an illegal spot.

816
01:03:42,992 --> 01:03:43,893
[SPEAKER_18]: It's painted yellow.

817
01:03:44,794 --> 01:03:46,475
[SPEAKER_18]: It's painted yellow as clear as day.

818
01:03:48,136 --> 01:03:50,117
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's between two crosswalks.

819
01:03:50,798 --> 01:03:57,623
[SPEAKER_18]: If I've ever seen a dangerous situation, that child came right out, and it was after the crossing guards were gone this afternoon.

820
01:03:58,543 --> 01:03:59,904
[SPEAKER_18]: That vehicle should not be there.

821
01:04:00,285 --> 01:04:05,148
[SPEAKER_18]: And I've often said it as I was driving by, I'm just surprised that it doesn't get tagged, doesn't get tagged, doesn't get tagged.

822
01:04:05,529 --> 01:04:08,371
[SPEAKER_18]: But today there was almost an awful accident.

823
01:04:09,312 --> 01:04:11,034
[SPEAKER_18]: I think you have to do something about that vehicle.

824
01:04:11,914 --> 01:04:17,259
[SPEAKER_18]: They have a legitimate handicapped sticker, then park it legally.

825
01:04:17,659 --> 01:04:21,482
[SPEAKER_18]: Don't park it illegally where someone's going to get injured because you're blocking the crosswalk.

826
01:04:22,763 --> 01:04:24,905
[SPEAKER_18]: That is unacceptable as far as I'm concerned, Chief.

827
01:04:25,345 --> 01:04:27,848
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think you have to deal with that situation because it's every day.

828
01:04:28,308 --> 01:04:29,889
[SPEAKER_18]: It's every single day.

829
01:04:29,929 --> 01:04:33,192
[SPEAKER_18]: And I almost saw a kid get hit today and I would have felt horrible.

830
01:04:33,983 --> 01:04:38,266
[SPEAKER_18]: If someone got hurt, and I didn't bring this to your attention earlier, but today it stuck out like a sore thumb.

831
01:04:38,987 --> 01:04:41,229
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I can tell you, Counselor, I'm aware of that vehicle.

832
01:04:41,249 --> 01:04:43,150
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm aware of the ownership of that vehicle.

833
01:04:43,731 --> 01:04:52,938
[SPEAKER_09]: And quite honestly, I have not had officers go to that address to tell them to move their vehicle, because I think the argument coming back would be that that would be retaliation.

834
01:04:52,958 --> 01:04:54,079
[SPEAKER_09]: Retaliation for what?

835
01:04:54,119 --> 01:04:55,880
[SPEAKER_09]: For their stance on the parking program.

836
01:04:55,940 --> 01:04:56,701
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, come on.

837
01:04:56,721 --> 01:05:01,385
[SPEAKER_09]: I will be going out there myself on Thursday, and I will be addressing it myself.

838
01:05:02,617 --> 01:05:04,218
[SPEAKER_18]: Listen, I don't care who parks there.

839
01:05:04,678 --> 01:05:06,738
[SPEAKER_18]: You could be someone that I disagree in the community with 180%.

840
01:05:06,778 --> 01:05:24,925
[SPEAKER_18]: If you're going to park illegally, and it's blatant disregard for two crosswalks, someone with a handicap sticker should understand and not park between a crosswalk where elderly and senior citizens and other handicapped people use.

841
01:05:27,281 --> 01:05:29,282
[SPEAKER_18]: retaliation for the parking program.

842
01:05:29,422 --> 01:05:30,122
[SPEAKER_18]: This is America.

843
01:05:30,622 --> 01:05:40,726
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyone can speak up for or against any issue, but don't think you're untouchable because you may just, uh, you may just, uh, it's not, it's believe me, the police department is not treating them as untouchable.

844
01:05:40,826 --> 01:05:41,306
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no.

845
01:05:41,627 --> 01:05:43,167
[SPEAKER_09]: It's about timing of the message.

846
01:05:43,547 --> 01:05:44,328
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I understand.

847
01:05:44,368 --> 01:05:50,310
[SPEAKER_18]: But, and like I said, this was, and I have to preface this, many people have brought that vehicle to my attention before.

848
01:05:51,815 --> 01:05:55,657
[SPEAKER_18]: And you know, you drive by and you see it, it's really not bothering anyone.

849
01:05:56,097 --> 01:06:09,703
[SPEAKER_18]: But when a car came around from high street, taking the right on Playstead Road, and it was a child, and the child actually popped his head back, would you be in agreement that it's a major safety issue?

850
01:06:09,863 --> 01:06:10,403
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, absolutely.

851
01:06:11,544 --> 01:06:15,206
[SPEAKER_18]: And as well, I've talked to other people that have drove engine two.

852
01:06:16,266 --> 01:06:19,487
[SPEAKER_18]: That vehicle actually, and this was years ago when it was a different car that was parking there every day.

853
01:06:19,507 --> 01:06:20,628
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not even sure if it's the same owner.

854
01:06:21,049 --> 01:06:29,157
[SPEAKER_18]: But Engine 2 sometimes has to make that swing when they're coming down High Street and making the swing to go down there.

855
01:06:29,517 --> 01:06:35,382
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's gotten the way before they've actually had to do a three-point turn on the way to an emergency call.

856
01:06:36,083 --> 01:06:44,411
[SPEAKER_18]: And last but not least, on that particular matter, the person can legally park in front of their store, from what you're saying.

857
01:06:45,612 --> 01:06:46,032
[SPEAKER_18]: That's correct.

858
01:06:47,020 --> 01:06:49,602
[SPEAKER_18]: Take a spot in front of your store that a customer may park in.

859
01:06:49,642 --> 01:06:55,047
[SPEAKER_18]: Legally, you don't have to pay the meter like everyone else, because you have a legitimate handicap placket.

860
01:06:55,988 --> 01:06:58,069
[SPEAKER_18]: But park it in a safe manner, as far as I'm concerned.

861
01:06:58,550 --> 01:07:07,978
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we are asking the members of the business community to try to park on the outskirts of the business district, so that consumers can park close to the stores.

862
01:07:08,598 --> 01:07:11,280
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, if I may, I know that that's- Can I just make one more comment?

863
01:07:11,380 --> 01:07:13,062
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not about- please.

864
01:07:14,023 --> 01:07:14,623
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President,

865
01:07:16,098 --> 01:07:28,390
[SPEAKER_18]: Another thing that's come to my attention with this park, and we have to set the record straight on this, a senior member of the mayor's office that lives in this community, one of his longest serving members in that office,

866
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:40,383
[SPEAKER_18]: has been putting statements on social media outlets that the reason this pocket is in place is because the Medford City Council didn't support a garage.

867
01:07:40,803 --> 01:07:53,086
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to make it loud and loud and loud and clear that the mayor of this community never brought a proposal to the Medford City Council for a garage because he did not have the votes.

868
01:07:53,526 --> 01:07:54,446
[SPEAKER_18]: And if we remember,

869
01:07:55,848 --> 01:08:07,517
[SPEAKER_18]: I, as one member of this council, urged him, urged him to take it to the council, take a vote up or down, and move forward on the issue, just like the Brooks estates and other issues that were before us.

870
01:08:08,157 --> 01:08:13,961
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it was pretty common knowledge that four members of the city council at the time were for a garage, three members of the council were against it.

871
01:08:14,282 --> 01:08:22,968
[SPEAKER_18]: But to throw the red herring out there that the Medford City Council is a direct result for this, that is not only a- Point of information, Mr. President.

872
01:08:23,428 --> 01:08:25,190
[SPEAKER_13]: Point of information, Councillor Marks.

873
01:08:25,961 --> 01:08:33,744
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I just don't understand how, even if a garage was built in Method Square, how that's going to help the business owners in West Method.

874
01:08:34,545 --> 01:08:35,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Help the business owners.

875
01:08:36,166 --> 01:08:42,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, if I could, Mr. President, help the business owners in Haines Square, help the business owners in South Method or up the hillside.

876
01:08:42,828 --> 01:08:45,250
[SPEAKER_04]: So a parking garage, that's just a big red herring.

877
01:08:46,010 --> 01:08:46,490
[SPEAKER_04]: And I agree.

878
01:08:46,550 --> 01:08:47,731
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just a big red herring.

879
01:08:48,271 --> 01:08:50,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, you know, this is the mayor's pay for parking program.

880
01:08:51,152 --> 01:08:51,592
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

881
01:08:51,612 --> 01:08:55,174
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, counselor, uh, marks on your point.

882
01:08:57,017 --> 01:08:58,899
[SPEAKER_14]: Councillor Camuso still has the floor.

883
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:01,122
[SPEAKER_14]: Councillor Penter on a point of clarification.

884
01:09:01,142 --> 01:09:02,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a point of further clarification.

885
01:09:02,343 --> 01:09:06,007
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree with Councillor Camuso, you know, and it's right, we can agree to disagree.

886
01:09:06,347 --> 01:09:09,731
[SPEAKER_05]: It was never brought before us, but have a member of the Mayor's staff go forward.

887
01:09:10,531 --> 01:09:11,913
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just absolutely crazy.

888
01:09:12,630 --> 01:09:24,833
[SPEAKER_05]: Further to the nonsense to all of this is the man behind our backs went and sought out one of our local state representatives and filed and had him file the transportation bill, $8 million to build the garage.

889
01:09:24,853 --> 01:09:26,173
[SPEAKER_05]: And we knew nothing about it.

890
01:09:26,794 --> 01:09:27,834
[SPEAKER_05]: The city knew nothing about it.

891
01:09:27,874 --> 01:09:28,994
[SPEAKER_05]: The council knew nothing about it.

892
01:09:29,174 --> 01:09:30,735
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a sneaky way to do an end run.

893
01:09:30,755 --> 01:09:31,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of information made.

894
01:09:32,617 --> 01:09:34,218
[SPEAKER_05]: clear, Mr. President, okay?

895
01:09:34,538 --> 01:09:35,319
[SPEAKER_05]: This is very important.

896
01:09:35,339 --> 01:09:36,900
[SPEAKER_05]: He brought up a very important issue.

897
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:45,606
[SPEAKER_05]: If this council is getting tagged for something that they never did, then it needs to be explained why they never did what they're being tagged for, because it was never presented before us.

898
01:09:46,126 --> 01:09:47,187
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Pinto.

899
01:09:47,587 --> 01:09:49,368
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Camusos has the chair.

900
01:09:49,448 --> 01:09:50,989
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President.

901
01:09:51,290 --> 01:09:59,055
[SPEAKER_18]: Just to be very clear, this council, the paper was before us for the parking program, and I'm not backpedaling at all.

902
01:09:59,725 --> 01:10:18,557
[SPEAKER_18]: seven members of this council saw the request for proposal, seven members of this council knew what it was going to consist of, the meter slash kiosk, but for someone in the administrative wing of this building to blatantly throw that out there, that that's the result, just because they're probably filled in hundreds and hundreds of calls per day.

903
01:10:18,939 --> 01:10:21,001
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just outright wrong.

904
01:10:21,621 --> 01:10:26,465
[SPEAKER_18]: Put the facts out there, that the mayor didn't bring that garage to this council because he knew he didn't have the votes at the time.

905
01:10:26,785 --> 01:10:30,108
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'll quite honestly tell you, I made my stance known at the time.

906
01:10:30,168 --> 01:10:35,011
[SPEAKER_18]: I was for the garage, and I was upset that he did not bring it forward and just put it behind us.

907
01:10:35,552 --> 01:10:40,035
[SPEAKER_18]: Take the vote, move on to the next issue, like we're supposed to do in the democratic process.

908
01:10:40,456 --> 01:10:41,717
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Camuso.

909
01:10:42,417 --> 01:10:44,759
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Marks, on the floor, did the chief want to make one more remark?

910
01:10:45,095 --> 01:10:50,757
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there were a list of items that I wanted to address based on last week's meeting that had been addressed in the interim.

911
01:10:50,998 --> 01:10:54,219
[SPEAKER_09]: At the request of Councilor Marks that you be permitted to do so.

912
01:10:54,619 --> 01:10:55,039
[SPEAKER_09]: Please do.

913
01:10:55,840 --> 01:11:01,702
[SPEAKER_09]: I know the last week there was some issues regarding the validation program that was proposed.

914
01:11:02,002 --> 01:11:06,144
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was based on the number of complaints or calls from the business community.

915
01:11:07,053 --> 01:11:18,379
[SPEAKER_09]: medical offices, hairdressers, other entities where a person may park in the square or any of the squares and be longer than the two hour max.

916
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:25,962
[SPEAKER_09]: We realized that there was some concern about the validation program and through some discussion with the mayor and others,

917
01:11:27,797 --> 01:11:30,619
[SPEAKER_09]: It was proposed to go to three hours in the municipal lots.

918
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:42,668
[SPEAKER_09]: All of the municipal lots in the city to include the hillside, Haines square, west Medford square, governor's ave, only the middle section, the two rows in the middle that are now two hours will be moved to three.

919
01:11:44,289 --> 01:11:55,917
[SPEAKER_09]: What we call the old Ruth's parking lot over here across the street on Riverside Avenue and clipper ship drive and the Yale street parking lot as well as the small parking lot that's

920
01:11:56,989 --> 01:12:08,153
[SPEAKER_09]: on Salem Street, I believe it's around number 60 Salem, right next to the National Grid building, and also the lot, the second lot behind City Hall, behind One City Hall Mall.

921
01:12:09,013 --> 01:12:12,855
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be business permit or three-hour parking.

922
01:12:13,535 --> 01:12:24,099
[SPEAKER_09]: And as I said earlier, that we're trying to encourage the business people to park on the outskirts of their business district in order to accommodate consumers who may want to take advantage of that.

923
01:12:25,502 --> 01:12:30,645
[SPEAKER_09]: That was at the Traffic Commission meeting today, and it was approved, so it will go forward as a three-hour lot.

924
01:12:31,685 --> 01:12:33,866
[SPEAKER_09]: The senior center, 25 spaces.

925
01:12:34,527 --> 01:12:37,748
[SPEAKER_09]: Initially, 25 spaces have been identified along the fence line.

926
01:12:38,969 --> 01:12:41,470
[SPEAKER_09]: Seniors will be able to park there for as long as they want.

927
01:12:41,550 --> 01:12:49,114
[SPEAKER_09]: It's for senior center use only, and there will be a decal issued to those people who will be registered to use that lot.

928
01:12:49,754 --> 01:12:52,676
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, going back to the other comment about HP placards,

929
01:12:53,790 --> 01:13:01,234
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately, many of their clientele possess HP placards, so they'll be able to park in that lot all day and not be touched.

930
01:13:02,414 --> 01:13:13,900
[SPEAKER_09]: The only issue I've spoken with Pam Kelly, the director over there, on a day when they may have a field trip or something when the spring and the weather is better, we may ask that the bus pick them up at a different location.

931
01:13:13,940 --> 01:13:18,963
[SPEAKER_09]: It might very well be right across behind the Hyatt Hotel where they can park over there

932
01:13:20,554 --> 01:13:22,195
[SPEAKER_09]: out of the way and not bother anyone.

933
01:13:22,215 --> 01:13:25,317
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're trying to make accommodations and things are moving forward on that front.

934
01:13:25,818 --> 01:13:35,244
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's at least 25 spaces that will be clearly marked and identified, senior center only, no fee, and they can be there all day.

935
01:13:35,964 --> 01:13:41,948
[SPEAKER_09]: We know that there's a certain time frame that they're there at the most, what the maximum time frame is.

936
01:13:42,349 --> 01:13:44,770
[SPEAKER_09]: And they'll have a permit that will be affixed to their vehicle.

937
01:13:45,111 --> 01:13:48,693
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be a new style permit, something similar to the Wrights Pond permit.

938
01:13:51,851 --> 01:13:58,634
[SPEAKER_05]: Council Penta when you say 25 spots, seniors only senior center use only senior center.

939
01:13:58,894 --> 01:13:59,774
[SPEAKER_05]: So where do they get these?

940
01:13:59,914 --> 01:14:01,035
[SPEAKER_05]: Where do they have to get these permits?

941
01:14:01,155 --> 01:14:10,879
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, these permits will be issued either through the police department or at the senior center with Pam Kelly with a police officer present to get together the information.

942
01:14:11,299 --> 01:14:14,980
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have the registrations and all the information that's necessary.

943
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:19,262
[SPEAKER_09]: So those, that data can be given to Republic so that they'll have,

944
01:14:20,063 --> 01:14:23,566
[SPEAKER_09]: have it in their license plate readers so they'll know those cars will be all right.

945
01:14:25,207 --> 01:14:26,048
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. Chief.

946
01:14:27,029 --> 01:14:36,878
[SPEAKER_09]: And lastly, there will be two handicap spaces added to the lot at the old Ruth's parking lot.

947
01:14:37,438 --> 01:14:46,466
[SPEAKER_09]: And four of those spots will be four-hour spots to accommodate some of the medical needs of patrons that utilize the building.

948
01:14:46,897 --> 01:14:50,018
[SPEAKER_09]: that there for various medical purposes that they would have to be there.

949
01:14:50,038 --> 01:14:54,078
[SPEAKER_09]: So only four out of those spaces will be identified for four hour spots.

950
01:14:55,218 --> 01:15:01,620
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I don't want to steal the thunder, but going back to the $3 fee, Mr. Nash did a lot of work.

951
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:09,461
[SPEAKER_09]: And as of last Friday, I got that matter resolved with the corporate higher ups that that will be, uh, taken off the, off the agenda.

952
01:15:10,641 --> 01:15:15,082
[SPEAKER_09]: The $3 fee that, that council, you had been mentioning the administrative $3 fee,

953
01:15:16,752 --> 01:15:22,297
[SPEAKER_09]: that it will no longer be used and others will be reimbursed.

954
01:15:22,837 --> 01:15:25,099
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a few other items from today's traffic commission.

955
01:15:28,082 --> 01:15:37,830
[SPEAKER_09]: On Governor's Avenue at the corner of High Street to accommodate three businesses that we heard from that right now the parking there is two hours posted.

956
01:15:38,552 --> 01:15:39,892
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been reduced to 30 minutes.

957
01:15:39,912 --> 01:15:41,333
[SPEAKER_09]: There are three parking spaces.

958
01:15:41,873 --> 01:15:49,734
[SPEAKER_09]: So now people can go in, get an ice cream, go into Rose's, get a sub or a roast beef, or go into Salvatore's to get something to go.

959
01:15:50,115 --> 01:15:52,415
[SPEAKER_09]: And they'd be able to in and out of there 30 minutes.

960
01:15:54,415 --> 01:15:56,396
[SPEAKER_09]: So remove that from the two hour limit.

961
01:15:56,476 --> 01:16:01,537
[SPEAKER_09]: We put a handy, a delivery zone, a loading zone.

962
01:16:02,275 --> 01:16:14,918
[SPEAKER_09]: The first parking space on Governor's Ave, next to zero Governor's Ave, in front of the two handicapped parking spaces in front of Governor's Ave to accommodate, whether it be the florist or anyone else that's having a delivery.

963
01:16:15,918 --> 01:16:17,258
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's one spot right there.

964
01:16:17,638 --> 01:16:19,679
[SPEAKER_09]: So there are some modifications that have been done.

965
01:16:22,459 --> 01:16:27,460
[SPEAKER_09]: The Play Academy, the young lady was here last week at 65 Riverside Avenue.

966
01:16:27,820 --> 01:16:29,101
[SPEAKER_09]: Today we passed four.

967
01:16:30,904 --> 01:16:40,427
[SPEAKER_09]: loadings on, drop off, pick up areas between the hours of 8 to 9.30 in the morning and 4 to 5.30 in the afternoon.

968
01:16:41,207 --> 01:16:48,049
[SPEAKER_09]: It would be 15 minutes to 30 minutes to drop children off in the morning and then on the return, picking them up in the afternoon.

969
01:16:48,429 --> 01:16:53,191
[SPEAKER_09]: And we've noticed over the past week there's absolutely no one using that street.

970
01:16:53,251 --> 01:16:57,272
[SPEAKER_09]: So it was a safe area and we could make the modification.

971
01:16:57,592 --> 01:17:00,373
[SPEAKER_09]: And if we see the four spaces are not enough, we're starting with four.

972
01:17:00,834 --> 01:17:03,355
[SPEAKER_09]: If we see that four are not enough, we'll be able to add to it.

973
01:17:06,217 --> 01:17:08,819
[SPEAKER_09]: Play Academy, on their request, was for four.

974
01:17:08,879 --> 01:17:12,621
[SPEAKER_09]: We discussed even more today, but we went with four, and then evaluate.

975
01:17:12,641 --> 01:17:16,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you go back to the parking lot, the back wall, the big parking lot?

976
01:17:16,783 --> 01:17:17,023
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

977
01:17:18,484 --> 01:17:25,909
[SPEAKER_09]: The big parking lot, the back wall against 15 Governor's Ave, as it's always been, is the only place that people with business permits can park in that lot.

978
01:17:27,089 --> 01:17:29,951
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's the back wall against 15 Governor's Ave.

979
01:17:30,649 --> 01:17:39,576
[SPEAKER_09]: The middle two rows will be three hours because of the number of doctor's offices in that area and medical appointments.

980
01:17:39,596 --> 01:17:42,018
[SPEAKER_09]: We heard that loud and clear from doctors and from patients.

981
01:17:43,099 --> 01:17:53,607
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the parallel that they run parallel behind the building, the existing postings that are there, there's a couple of 15 minute spots and I believe a couple of spots that are one hour spots.

982
01:17:54,168 --> 01:17:55,769
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are not being touched at this time.

983
01:17:58,391 --> 01:17:59,172
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they're one hour.

984
01:18:00,173 --> 01:18:03,076
[SPEAKER_09]: But there's at least two spots that are 15 minutes.

985
01:18:09,521 --> 01:18:11,182
[SPEAKER_09]: So there have been some modifications.

986
01:18:11,282 --> 01:18:19,089
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know it's probably an overused term, but this parking management program is fluid.

987
01:18:19,469 --> 01:18:20,470
[SPEAKER_09]: There will be changes.

988
01:18:21,050 --> 01:18:22,011
[SPEAKER_09]: There will be hiccups.

989
01:18:22,551 --> 01:18:26,695
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're going to work diligently to correct whatever might happen along the way.

990
01:18:27,656 --> 01:18:29,177
[SPEAKER_09]: But we're not really going to know

991
01:18:29,687 --> 01:18:38,955
[SPEAKER_09]: until Thursday when the on street parking enforcement begins, the business district enforcement, and then the 26 with the permit parking enforcement.

992
01:18:41,497 --> 01:18:42,237
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, chief.

993
01:18:42,438 --> 01:18:46,841
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, counselor Marks had the floor, uh, point of information.

994
01:18:46,901 --> 01:18:47,862
[SPEAKER_14]: Counselor Caraviello.

995
01:18:49,343 --> 01:18:55,709
[SPEAKER_16]: I, I had a, I had a check with the chief, but counselor Marks.

996
01:18:56,669 --> 01:18:57,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

997
01:18:57,610 --> 01:18:58,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh,

998
01:18:59,063 --> 01:19:01,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Chief, you're not kidding when you say there's been some modifications.

999
01:19:01,404 --> 01:19:05,025
[SPEAKER_04]: There's been a lot of modifications, and I know this is a work in progress.

1000
01:19:05,785 --> 01:19:10,687
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm waiting the day that you come in here and say that we're not going to do pay-for-pocket.

1001
01:19:11,788 --> 01:19:15,649
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that'll be the modification that everyone is looking for, to be quite honest with you.

1002
01:19:15,909 --> 01:19:23,632
[SPEAKER_04]: I think all we need is consistent — all we need is consistent enforcement, Chief.

1003
01:19:23,672 --> 01:19:26,953
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was the recommendation made by the committee five years ago.

1004
01:19:27,522 --> 01:19:45,917
[SPEAKER_04]: But if I could just state, Chief, when this proposal was brought up by the mayor, he mentioned on several occasions with backing from this council that when this program officially starts, that there'd be at least a two-week grace period where tickets would not be real tickets.

1005
01:19:46,698 --> 01:19:50,281
[SPEAKER_04]: So for two weeks, Republic would be out there.

1006
01:19:50,941 --> 01:19:56,266
[SPEAKER_04]: They'd be doing, when this starts, this particular parking enforcement, and they'd give out a ticket that says,

1007
01:19:56,925 --> 01:19:58,786
[SPEAKER_04]: In two weeks from now, this will be a real ticket.

1008
01:19:58,906 --> 01:20:04,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure you feed your meat, or make sure you don't park in front of a hydrant, or make sure and give out fake tickets.

1009
01:20:05,390 --> 01:20:10,313
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we all agreed upon that, and I'm hearing nothing about that at all.

1010
01:20:11,093 --> 01:20:11,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing at all.

1011
01:20:11,874 --> 01:20:25,202
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was a major bone of contention with this council, because of the fact that this city has had lax enforcement for many, many years, and we're going into a program that, in my opinion, is very aggressive.

1012
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:28,802
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm very disappointed to hear that that's not going to take place.

1013
01:20:29,422 --> 01:20:31,743
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if that's, I'll leave that to Mr. Nash.

1014
01:20:31,764 --> 01:20:37,047
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure if that's taking place as of the 15th or whether actual enforcement is going to begin.

1015
01:20:37,567 --> 01:20:42,129
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that there's been a lot of... We just got a phone call saying the enforcement is going to begin on the 15th.

1016
01:20:42,570 --> 01:20:42,970
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that.

1017
01:20:43,370 --> 01:20:44,731
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't say fake enforcement.

1018
01:20:45,792 --> 01:20:46,612
[SPEAKER_09]: They said enforcement.

1019
01:20:47,755 --> 01:20:50,597
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I wouldn't call even the reminder notice a fake enforcement.

1020
01:20:50,637 --> 01:20:51,517
[SPEAKER_09]: It's still an enforcement.

1021
01:20:51,557 --> 01:20:52,678
[SPEAKER_09]: It's an education period.

1022
01:20:52,718 --> 01:20:54,199
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's not costing you.

1023
01:20:54,219 --> 01:20:56,160
[SPEAKER_04]: When I say fake, it's not costing you anything.

1024
01:20:56,460 --> 01:20:57,360
[SPEAKER_09]: It's far from fake.

1025
01:20:57,640 --> 01:20:59,421
[SPEAKER_04]: But Chief, the reverse has been happening.

1026
01:20:59,942 --> 01:21:04,204
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not doing any enforcement now, and we're letting residents put money in the kiosk.

1027
01:21:06,365 --> 01:21:07,126
[SPEAKER_04]: How does that happen?

1028
01:21:08,927 --> 01:21:09,687
[SPEAKER_04]: No enforcement.

1029
01:21:09,807 --> 01:21:15,450
[SPEAKER_04]: The company's not doing their job, but we're asking residents to put money in a kiosk without enforcement.

1030
01:21:17,332 --> 01:21:18,573
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't understand, Chief.

1031
01:21:18,793 --> 01:21:19,633
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not blaming you.

1032
01:21:19,813 --> 01:21:20,554
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not blaming you.

1033
01:21:21,134 --> 01:21:21,594
[SPEAKER_04]: But, Chief.

1034
01:21:21,614 --> 01:21:21,875
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm here.

1035
01:21:21,935 --> 01:21:22,755
[SPEAKER_09]: I can take the blame.

1036
01:21:22,835 --> 01:21:24,056
[SPEAKER_09]: I have no problem with that.

1037
01:21:24,076 --> 01:21:25,116
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, then I'll blame you then.

1038
01:21:25,176 --> 01:21:30,719
[SPEAKER_09]: The fact of the matter is that no one's telling the people to put the money in the kiosk if they're putting it in there.

1039
01:21:30,739 --> 01:21:31,440
[SPEAKER_09]: No one has told them.

1040
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:33,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Chief, you have a kiosk out in the street.

1041
01:21:34,301 --> 01:21:35,502
[SPEAKER_04]: You have new signage.

1042
01:21:38,543 --> 01:21:39,424
[SPEAKER_13]: Point of information.

1043
01:21:40,549 --> 01:21:43,451
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you had to be down South Met for the other day, okay?

1044
01:21:43,731 --> 01:21:49,553
[SPEAKER_05]: When they had two of those so-called ambassadors arguing with people, people telling the people they had to put the money into the META.

1045
01:21:50,934 --> 01:21:52,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Caviello, I think you're aware of it.

1046
01:21:53,455 --> 01:21:53,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, sir.

1047
01:21:54,175 --> 01:21:54,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1048
01:21:55,496 --> 01:21:57,157
[SPEAKER_05]: So don't say they weren't.

1049
01:21:57,197 --> 01:21:57,617
[SPEAKER_05]: They weren't.

1050
01:21:57,657 --> 01:22:02,559
[SPEAKER_05]: They weren't telling people they had to put the money into the META, and that is absolutely false.

1051
01:22:03,180 --> 01:22:04,200
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Penta.

1052
01:22:04,615 --> 01:22:07,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Mark still has the floor.

1053
01:22:07,156 --> 01:22:08,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Just, just if I could chief.

1054
01:22:08,217 --> 01:22:11,179
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so that's where something inconsistencies lie.

1055
01:22:11,659 --> 01:22:17,242
[SPEAKER_04]: I know the gentleman's here and I hope he can answer the question regarding the enforcement that's going to take place on the 15th.

1056
01:22:17,962 --> 01:22:31,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, my, my second point chief is when this, uh, plan, uh, that the mayor offered, uh, his plan from the get go was to do, uh, enforcement throughout every business district because it was mentioned that start off

1057
01:22:32,330 --> 01:22:33,690
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe in phased approaches.

1058
01:22:34,010 --> 01:22:38,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do Meffitt Square first, that's our largest business district, and maybe phase it around.

1059
01:22:38,731 --> 01:22:42,512
[SPEAKER_04]: And the mayor was adamant about saying, no, we're doing every business district.

1060
01:22:42,812 --> 01:22:44,372
[SPEAKER_04]: And I agreed with the mayor at the time.

1061
01:22:45,112 --> 01:22:47,873
[SPEAKER_04]: But now we're seeing spot enforcement.

1062
01:22:48,233 --> 01:22:54,234
[SPEAKER_04]: We're seeing areas on Salem Street that are commercial areas that have kiosks and other areas that have nothing.

1063
01:22:54,674 --> 01:22:59,375
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would agree with the gentleman from Dab's walk that came up over the last couple of weeks.

1064
01:22:59,935 --> 01:23:01,795
[SPEAKER_04]: How can you have a sub-shop in West Meffitt

1065
01:23:02,178 --> 01:23:07,402
[SPEAKER_04]: that the customers have to pay 50 cents to go in and get a sandwich, but on Salem Street, they don't have to pay anything.

1066
01:23:08,182 --> 01:23:12,305
[SPEAKER_04]: I, as a customer, might say, you know what, I'll drive three minutes up the street and save the 50 cents.

1067
01:23:13,366 --> 01:23:15,668
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to treat every business the same.

1068
01:23:16,008 --> 01:23:19,270
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no way that we can phase in this type of approach, Chief.

1069
01:23:19,710 --> 01:23:30,378
[SPEAKER_04]: So whether the consultant plan from years ago said put kiosks in certain areas and not others, the city had to take a long, hard look and say, we have to treat everyone fairly.

1070
01:23:30,697 --> 01:23:32,218
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's not happening right now, Chief.

1071
01:23:32,578 --> 01:23:34,339
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would hope that happens sooner than later.

1072
01:23:34,660 --> 01:23:53,232
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I think you know that you notice there's some gaps in the locations because some of the districts that you're referring to as business districts, you know, maybe it was a misstatement, but the fact of the matter is the major business districts are being affected by having the meters and the kiosks and the enforcement.

1073
01:23:53,707 --> 01:23:57,708
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of those other locations do have time limits, not all of them, but some of them do have time limits.

1074
01:23:57,728 --> 01:23:58,949
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not pay for parking chief.

1075
01:23:59,069 --> 01:24:04,731
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not pay for parking, but it's still time limit, which wasn't enforced before and will be like park in Salem.

1076
01:24:05,251 --> 01:24:11,733
[SPEAKER_09]: And I believe down at the other end of high street where Joe, Joe's pizza, Giles liquor store, believe it's time limits there as well.

1077
01:24:11,853 --> 01:24:14,254
[SPEAKER_09]: And if I go throughout the city, there are time limits.

1078
01:24:16,454 --> 01:24:18,455
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there used to be, I don't know.

1079
01:24:18,670 --> 01:24:21,591
[SPEAKER_04]: But Chief, I guess I'm saying we need consistency throughout the community.

1080
01:24:21,611 --> 01:24:22,172
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I'm saying.

1081
01:24:22,192 --> 01:24:22,512
[SPEAKER_04]: I get that.

1082
01:24:22,532 --> 01:24:29,796
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand that some people will look at it and say it's not fair because the shop has a meter and, as you said, funeral powers and whatever.

1083
01:24:30,536 --> 01:24:33,257
[SPEAKER_09]: But it is built to grow if it proves necessary.

1084
01:24:33,598 --> 01:24:34,618
[SPEAKER_09]: Point of information, Councilor Grusso.

1085
01:24:34,638 --> 01:24:35,438
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't disagree with that.

1086
01:24:35,478 --> 01:24:38,800
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just that there are a certain number of meters that were allocated many hours in Grusso.

1087
01:24:38,820 --> 01:24:39,741
[SPEAKER_09]: Point of information, Councilor Grusso.

1088
01:24:39,761 --> 01:24:41,582
[SPEAKER_18]: Built to grow after the program's already established.

1089
01:24:43,002 --> 01:24:47,965
[SPEAKER_18]: The point of information I have is some of these ones, they're not in.

1090
01:24:49,082 --> 01:24:54,184
[SPEAKER_18]: a major square, as long as the time limit is enforced.

1091
01:24:56,145 --> 01:25:04,248
[SPEAKER_18]: The whole purpose of this is to keep the turnover so that if there's a bunch of stores together, it's not just one business that's getting all the parking.

1092
01:25:04,548 --> 01:25:05,268
[SPEAKER_18]: It's for the turnover.

1093
01:25:05,288 --> 01:25:07,389
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what we heard loud and clear, at least from the Chamber of Commerce.

1094
01:25:08,009 --> 01:25:17,393
[SPEAKER_18]: If it's like Joe's Pizza, I don't want to use names, but down in the Arlington line, if they're parking cars out there all day, it's only affecting Joe.

1095
01:25:18,275 --> 01:25:29,319
[SPEAKER_18]: That one establishment, if you go down to Haines Square or West Medford or Medford Square, and you park a car out there all day, you're having a residual effect on all the businesses that can't have their customers parked there.

1096
01:25:29,739 --> 01:25:31,940
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think the rationale was to do the major ones first.

1097
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,380
[SPEAKER_18]: Is that correct for that reason?

1098
01:25:33,661 --> 01:25:34,141
[SPEAKER_09]: That's correct.

1099
01:25:34,461 --> 01:25:37,322
[SPEAKER_18]: Because it was the turnover thing that the Chamber of Commerce was looking for.

1100
01:25:38,362 --> 01:25:38,802
[SPEAKER_14]: Correct.

1101
01:25:39,223 --> 01:25:40,303
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Camuso.

1102
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:44,283
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Marks, you still have the floor.

1103
01:25:45,664 --> 01:25:46,484
[SPEAKER_14]: And other councilors are waiting.

1104
01:25:46,524 --> 01:25:51,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Turnover is created by consistent enforcement, not by kiosks, not by meters.

1105
01:25:53,130 --> 01:25:56,452
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not what turns spots over, it's consistent enforcement.

1106
01:25:56,872 --> 01:26:02,277
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't want people to believe that just because a kiosk is out there, cars are gonna move on.

1107
01:26:02,517 --> 01:26:03,377
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not the case.

1108
01:26:04,118 --> 01:26:06,120
[SPEAKER_04]: It's enforcement that moves cars along.

1109
01:26:06,540 --> 01:26:09,222
[SPEAKER_04]: My other point, Chief, was I received a call from a woman

1110
01:26:09,643 --> 01:26:19,571
[SPEAKER_04]: that stated that she has a tough time finding out clearly where pay-for-parking starts and ends in a particular business district.

1111
01:26:20,172 --> 01:26:29,019
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you pull up, and I would agree, sometimes it's very confusing when you pull into Medford Square and you don't know where the pay-for-parking really ends.

1112
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:38,107
[SPEAKER_04]: The signage might point this or that way, but it's very difficult and there's gotta be a better way of marking where pay-for-parking is.

1113
01:26:38,817 --> 01:26:41,618
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's important and something that should be looked at, Chief.

1114
01:26:42,058 --> 01:26:42,598
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll look at it.

1115
01:26:42,638 --> 01:26:45,718
[SPEAKER_09]: If you could tell me a specific location, I'd be glad to go out there and look at it.

1116
01:26:46,239 --> 01:26:58,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think it's in, she mentioned the Meffitt Square, but I think it's in all the business districts that it's difficult on the fringes I'm talking, not in the heart, but in the fringes of the business districts to see where it stops.

1117
01:26:58,581 --> 01:27:00,482
[SPEAKER_09]: I do know that there's a lot of signage out there.

1118
01:27:00,502 --> 01:27:07,003
[SPEAKER_09]: It might be confusing for some people, but there is a lot of signage pointing in directions of where the kiosks would be that they'd have to pay if

1119
01:27:07,707 --> 01:27:13,051
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, if they're in that parking space, but certainly look at it.

1120
01:27:13,111 --> 01:27:19,115
[SPEAKER_09]: But, and the other issue too, as we've discussed in the past is actually marking, physically marking parking spaces.

1121
01:27:19,195 --> 01:27:23,097
[SPEAKER_09]: So you don't have one car straddling and taking up two spots.

1122
01:27:23,918 --> 01:27:28,301
[SPEAKER_09]: So actually designate the actual parking stall.

1123
01:27:29,662 --> 01:27:33,384
[SPEAKER_04]: And just my last point, and I mentioned it last week, chief, but it's a major issue.

1124
01:27:33,845 --> 01:27:37,307
[SPEAKER_04]: It was an issue that was brought up five years ago when our committee that we sat on,

1125
01:27:37,868 --> 01:27:41,251
[SPEAKER_04]: about having citywide resident permit parking.

1126
01:27:42,251 --> 01:27:46,855
[SPEAKER_04]: And with this enforcement, like you mentioned, you're going to see people start to go into the neighborhoods.

1127
01:27:47,315 --> 01:27:53,540
[SPEAKER_04]: And those streets that don't have permit parking, that abut business districts, are going to take a brunt of this.

1128
01:27:54,240 --> 01:27:56,782
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's not going to be any enforcement on those streets, Chief.

1129
01:27:57,383 --> 01:28:06,910
[SPEAKER_04]: And to have a permit, when I go and get a permit, and my permit as a resident of Method, a taxpayer, that's only good for my street, is ridiculous.

1130
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:10,321
[SPEAKER_04]: I should be able to park on any street in the city.

1131
01:28:10,921 --> 01:28:14,462
[SPEAKER_04]: We should have one resident permit parking that covers all residents.

1132
01:28:14,862 --> 01:28:17,423
[SPEAKER_04]: It should be issued free every year to residents.

1133
01:28:17,983 --> 01:28:23,304
[SPEAKER_04]: The $10 charge is, to me, a charge that we could forego.

1134
01:28:23,864 --> 01:28:27,945
[SPEAKER_04]: And every resident should get a resident permit parking sticker.

1135
01:28:28,506 --> 01:28:33,407
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we can keep out, because I think the issue is that we're seeing people from other communities.

1136
01:28:33,787 --> 01:28:36,328
[SPEAKER_04]: I live near the Orange Line, so my street's filled up.

1137
01:28:36,568 --> 01:28:37,388
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't live on a resident

1138
01:28:37,650 --> 01:28:40,572
[SPEAKER_04]: permit parking street, every morning it fills up with commuters.

1139
01:28:41,312 --> 01:28:46,355
[SPEAKER_04]: I can see them coming in, I see them with their briefcase, I wave to them, and they're off for 8 to 10 hours.

1140
01:28:47,235 --> 01:28:52,118
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, Chief, that should be consistent throughout our whole community, and that would cut it all out.

1141
01:28:52,458 --> 01:28:56,200
[SPEAKER_04]: It would cut all those people that are coming into our community, parking on our side roads.

1142
01:28:56,541 --> 01:29:00,383
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll cut out all those people that are going to the business district and saying, I don't want to pay 50 cents.

1143
01:29:01,022 --> 01:29:04,043
[SPEAKER_04]: let me go up two streets and I can park there for several hours.

1144
01:29:04,664 --> 01:29:06,304
[SPEAKER_04]: It really needs to be looked at now.

1145
01:29:06,324 --> 01:29:10,426
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know you said we're going to look at it down the line, but that should have been looked at five years ago.

1146
01:29:11,167 --> 01:29:18,590
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I don't disagree that it should have been looked at five years ago, but we all do have other jobs to do other than just, you know, being a member of the traffic commission.

1147
01:29:18,990 --> 01:29:19,911
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't disagree.

1148
01:29:20,031 --> 01:29:25,333
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think some of the information we've already received from Republic based on the registrations they've taken for permit parking,

1149
01:29:26,034 --> 01:29:32,102
[SPEAKER_09]: If there's a need, at least at a minimum, to go area-wide or zone the permit parking.

1150
01:29:32,462 --> 01:29:35,846
[SPEAKER_09]: And it may develop into something that will be city-wide permit parking.

1151
01:29:36,387 --> 01:29:39,831
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's something we're going to get further data as we go between now and June.

1152
01:29:39,871 --> 01:29:41,253
[SPEAKER_09]: I anticipate that we will have

1153
01:29:41,832 --> 01:29:49,716
[SPEAKER_09]: a traffic commission in June, traffic commission meeting in June to address things going forward for the, for the new year, say 2016.

1154
01:29:50,276 --> 01:29:52,717
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll either have citywide or zone.

1155
01:29:53,098 --> 01:29:57,740
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't predetermine that until I see what the, what the load is for all of that.

1156
01:29:57,780 --> 01:30:02,943
[SPEAKER_09]: But because they're on board and they have the license plate readers, they have all the data.

1157
01:30:03,043 --> 01:30:05,624
[SPEAKER_09]: Everything is in the technology.

1158
01:30:06,143 --> 01:30:11,927
[SPEAKER_09]: we would be able to access all this information that we weren't able to do before because everything was done by hand.

1159
01:30:12,667 --> 01:30:17,991
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be able to now determine what the, what the need really is and whether it be citywide zones.

1160
01:30:18,471 --> 01:30:23,074
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, there's absolutely a need to revise the 1970s document for permanent parking.

1161
01:30:23,094 --> 01:30:25,515
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no, absolutely no doubt about that.

1162
01:30:26,296 --> 01:30:34,301
[SPEAKER_09]: But for everyone that says that there should be, you know, that I should be able to park on any street, a person on that street doesn't want the person from the neighborhood

1163
01:30:35,023 --> 01:30:36,663
[SPEAKER_09]: from the neighboring street on their street.

1164
01:30:36,743 --> 01:30:41,304
[SPEAKER_09]: We get that complaint all the time, all the time, no matter what street you're on.

1165
01:30:41,344 --> 01:30:53,766
[SPEAKER_09]: If you have permit parking, the street that's diagonally across from you, if there's no parking there and now they're parking your street with a permit, they're going to be the ones that will flood the meeting and say, no, no, we want it just for our street.

1166
01:30:54,287 --> 01:30:56,867
[SPEAKER_09]: But we're willing to go that route because now we're going to have some information.

1167
01:30:56,887 --> 01:30:58,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the system allowed that for years.

1168
01:30:59,808 --> 01:31:02,448
[SPEAKER_04]: I might live next to a street that has resident permit parking.

1169
01:31:03,139 --> 01:31:05,341
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't park on this street, but they can park on my street.

1170
01:31:05,741 --> 01:31:06,982
[SPEAKER_04]: So it became territorial.

1171
01:31:07,503 --> 01:31:10,085
[SPEAKER_04]: If you do it citywide, chief, everyone parks where they can.

1172
01:31:10,385 --> 01:31:12,166
[SPEAKER_04]: And I realize there's going to be problem spots.

1173
01:31:12,186 --> 01:31:18,892
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there's going to be certain streets that maybe residents want to park on so they can jump on the T. And those are the things we're going to have to look at.

1174
01:31:19,228 --> 01:31:21,150
[SPEAKER_04]: But this needs to be done citywide.

1175
01:31:21,290 --> 01:31:21,750
[SPEAKER_09]: It will be.

1176
01:31:21,810 --> 01:31:25,073
[SPEAKER_09]: But there's a lot of stuff going on right now, as you said in the beginning.

1177
01:31:25,173 --> 01:31:26,974
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, there's been a lot of modifications.

1178
01:31:27,014 --> 01:31:30,657
[SPEAKER_09]: So, that was something that was too big to tackle at the very beginning.

1179
01:31:30,878 --> 01:31:33,340
[SPEAKER_09]: It will be something that will be addressed, I can guarantee you.

1180
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:37,623
[SPEAKER_09]: Something will take place for the 2016 permits.

1181
01:31:38,044 --> 01:31:46,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, I just want to say, and Councilor Pinto said it correctly, that I appreciate the Chief coming up here so far every week.

1182
01:31:47,576 --> 01:31:51,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, he, he's been forthcoming with his answers.

1183
01:31:51,258 --> 01:31:53,700
[SPEAKER_04]: If he doesn't have an answer, he, he researches it.

1184
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:57,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, he's been the face of parking enforcement, whether you like it or not, chief.

1185
01:31:58,643 --> 01:32:01,364
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, you know, and I appreciate that chief.

1186
01:32:01,404 --> 01:32:03,305
[SPEAKER_04]: And this was a large endeavor.

1187
01:32:03,786 --> 01:32:07,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, the city for years stuck its head, its head in the sand and didn't want to do anything.

1188
01:32:08,308 --> 01:32:11,870
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, it would have been nice to have the mayor present his proposal.

1189
01:32:12,851 --> 01:32:13,811
[SPEAKER_04]: This is his baby.

1190
01:32:13,871 --> 01:32:16,453
[SPEAKER_04]: He should have presented it, but you're up here presenting it.

1191
01:32:17,238 --> 01:32:18,438
[SPEAKER_04]: And I appreciate that fact.

1192
01:32:18,478 --> 01:32:22,199
[SPEAKER_04]: But it would also be nice to hear from the mayor.

1193
01:32:22,999 --> 01:32:25,099
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, his sign says, leadership that works.

1194
01:32:26,020 --> 01:32:27,900
[SPEAKER_04]: But it only works when the heat's not on, I guess.

1195
01:32:28,540 --> 01:32:30,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when the heat's on, he's nowhere to be found.

1196
01:32:31,201 --> 01:32:40,362
[SPEAKER_09]: The only thing I can say on a lot of this is that pretty much everyone in the city realized this was coming.

1197
01:32:41,382 --> 01:32:43,443
[SPEAKER_09]: They knew that we had been talking.

1198
01:32:44,807 --> 01:32:57,431
[SPEAKER_09]: We've been talking about this for a number of years, and I know there have been several council meetings that people were saying that the recommendation was put forward, nothing has been acted on, it finally got acted on.

1199
01:32:57,471 --> 01:33:04,554
[SPEAKER_09]: But then even when it was acted on and a company was hired, there really wasn't a lot of discussion or pushback from the community.

1200
01:33:05,134 --> 01:33:10,196
[SPEAKER_09]: It only actually got off the ground when people started seeing the physical structures on the street.

1201
01:33:10,896 --> 01:33:13,637
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's when everyone said, boy, this is real, this is happening.

1202
01:33:14,646 --> 01:33:17,247
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's pretty much what I said last week.

1203
01:33:17,287 --> 01:33:18,627
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's a new day.

1204
01:33:19,167 --> 01:33:19,627
[SPEAKER_09]: It's here.

1205
01:33:20,028 --> 01:33:20,848
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to begin.

1206
01:33:20,868 --> 01:33:24,349
[SPEAKER_09]: And as I said, we're going to need your patience.

1207
01:33:24,369 --> 01:33:25,869
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to need the public's patience.

1208
01:33:26,909 --> 01:33:28,810
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're not looking to croak anyone.

1209
01:33:28,830 --> 01:33:31,231
[SPEAKER_09]: We're looking to get things done and get it done right.

1210
01:33:31,611 --> 01:33:33,131
[SPEAKER_09]: And if there are problems, we're going to rectify it.

1211
01:33:33,151 --> 01:33:37,332
[SPEAKER_09]: And if there are other locations that require the enforcement, they'll be done as well.

1212
01:33:37,772 --> 01:33:43,574
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you're going to see a big or tremendous leap, especially in the enforcement of resident permit package.

1213
01:33:44,315 --> 01:33:48,057
[SPEAKER_09]: something that really has been on the back burner for a long time.

1214
01:33:48,617 --> 01:33:51,638
[SPEAKER_09]: Can we ask the gentleman from Republic about the grace period?

1215
01:33:51,698 --> 01:33:52,458
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.

1216
01:33:52,478 --> 01:33:56,560
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure there's some other things he wants to address too from the business end.

1217
01:33:56,580 --> 01:34:02,802
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a number of counselors waiting patiently to speak.

1218
01:34:03,303 --> 01:34:09,105
[SPEAKER_08]: What I can tell you about the grace period that we've been instructed, I don't know about the two weeks, but for the first month of the program,

1219
01:34:09,998 --> 01:34:17,180
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyone that violates the pay the meter aspect ordinance would receive a warning for their first offense.

1220
01:34:17,721 --> 01:34:21,582
[SPEAKER_08]: Any ordinances that were already in the books, we've been instructed to issue citations on those.

1221
01:34:22,102 --> 01:34:30,285
[SPEAKER_08]: So items such as, you know, over the time limit that already have been on the books with the city, those would not be getting a grace period.

1222
01:34:30,545 --> 01:34:35,066
[SPEAKER_08]: But the new, if you do not pay a meter, your first offense would be a warning.

1223
01:34:35,587 --> 01:34:36,907
[SPEAKER_08]: And that will go on for the first month.

1224
01:34:37,553 --> 01:34:38,934
[SPEAKER_08]: Response starting January 15th.

1225
01:34:39,414 --> 01:34:40,695
[SPEAKER_08]: Starting January 15th.

1226
01:34:40,775 --> 01:34:41,055
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, sir.

1227
01:34:41,295 --> 01:34:42,936
[SPEAKER_08]: So until, until February 15th.

1228
01:34:43,937 --> 01:34:44,117
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1229
01:34:44,457 --> 01:34:46,518
[SPEAKER_08]: So, but I mean, you can't do it every day.

1230
01:34:46,558 --> 01:34:53,422
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you did it, once you did it once, you'd get a warning and then you would be subject to a ticket at that point.

1231
01:34:54,263 --> 01:34:54,623
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1232
01:34:55,183 --> 01:34:56,084
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm sorry, Dan Nash.

1233
01:34:56,124 --> 01:34:57,865
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm district manager with Republic Park.

1234
01:34:58,385 --> 01:34:58,625
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1235
01:34:58,725 --> 01:35:00,866
[SPEAKER_08]: And did you have anything else you want to address the council on?

1236
01:35:01,067 --> 01:35:03,068
[SPEAKER_08]: Two other quick things that I think came up.

1237
01:35:03,848 --> 01:35:06,790
[SPEAKER_08]: The validation program since the traffic commission passed the three hour,

1238
01:35:07,465 --> 01:35:09,606
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, zone and all the municipal lots.

1239
01:35:09,666 --> 01:35:14,708
[SPEAKER_08]: The validation program has actually been put on hold and won't be, won't be done at this point.

1240
01:35:15,409 --> 01:35:23,032
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, we're hoping that the three hour allotment and the lots will help, uh, all the businesses, um, discussing the visitor passes.

1241
01:35:23,512 --> 01:35:31,376
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyone that comes into the office as of today was walked out with their physical visitor passes and the mailings for all the visitor passes have begun today.

1242
01:35:31,716 --> 01:35:35,258
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're kind of going alphabetically through the various streets.

1243
01:35:36,745 --> 01:36:01,242
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyone that comes into our office as of today would walk out with their visitor passes in hand anyone that came in prior today They started going out in the mail today So they'll be getting their visitor passes and within the next two to five days So what happens if somebody The 15th comes and goes now they don't have a residential permit is not gonna be enforced as January 26 They won't be in violation.

1244
01:36:01,322 --> 01:36:01,502
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay

1245
01:36:03,070 --> 01:36:14,420
[SPEAKER_08]: And lastly, in light of what Councilor Knight said last week about the DPW and hanging the signs, we're actually working with the DPW now for any signs and anything that needs to be hung, and Republic will be paying for their services for that.

1246
01:36:15,121 --> 01:36:15,782
[SPEAKER_08]: That's most to us.

1247
01:36:19,265 --> 01:36:21,547
[SPEAKER_08]: That would have to be something you'd have to talk to the mayor's office about.

1248
01:36:24,042 --> 01:36:24,482
[SPEAKER_08]: employees.

1249
01:36:24,922 --> 01:36:28,344
[SPEAKER_08]: They did ask us how many hours we had staff out there.

1250
01:36:28,404 --> 01:36:28,785
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

1251
01:36:28,805 --> 01:36:33,967
[SPEAKER_08]: We reported the hours back to the administration as to what we did and how long we did it for.

1252
01:36:33,987 --> 01:36:35,288
[SPEAKER_08]: It was one day about 40 hours.

1253
01:36:35,528 --> 01:36:38,890
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Cavriel has patiently waited for a number of issues.

1254
01:36:39,671 --> 01:36:45,113
[SPEAKER_16]: I spoke to the mayor the other day about this.

1255
01:36:46,674 --> 01:36:53,278
[SPEAKER_16]: The ambassadors that you have floating around the areas, is there a possibility of keeping them on a little longer because

1256
01:36:53,640 --> 01:36:58,763
[SPEAKER_16]: You had them on last weekend, and in all fairness, it was zero degrees out.

1257
01:37:00,484 --> 01:37:06,788
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, even if you wanted to learn about the thing, it was impossible to stand out there and figure it out.

1258
01:37:07,809 --> 01:37:14,633
[SPEAKER_16]: Would it be possible to keep them on a few more weeks, a couple more weeks, seeing that it's been a little extra cold out?

1259
01:37:15,093 --> 01:37:20,057
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we'll put a few more out, and we'll take the ones off that we're giving misinformation and asking people to pay the meter.

1260
01:37:20,457 --> 01:37:22,038
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, not so much with the misinformation,

1261
01:37:22,942 --> 01:37:29,907
[SPEAKER_16]: No, because I say last week it was, it was zero degrees out there and understand out there and have, you know, have somebody trying to explain to you.

1262
01:37:29,947 --> 01:37:32,088
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, it was a, it was fruitless.

1263
01:37:32,508 --> 01:37:32,849
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree.

1264
01:37:32,909 --> 01:37:38,833
[SPEAKER_08]: And there'll be a handful of people out on Thursday when we start doing the enforcement and trying to educate the people before we start ticketing.

1265
01:37:39,153 --> 01:37:39,373
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1266
01:37:40,334 --> 01:37:49,920
[SPEAKER_16]: Chief, I see there was no talk about the reducing of the hours from eight at the late o'clock from seven.

1267
01:37:52,230 --> 01:37:57,652
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, there was some discussion today, and we actually had a motion at the end of our meeting.

1268
01:37:57,692 --> 01:38:02,714
[SPEAKER_09]: It was brought up by a business person in West Medford Square asking about moving from 7 to 8.

1269
01:38:02,754 --> 01:38:05,216
[SPEAKER_09]: Most of these small businesses do their business.

1270
01:38:05,276 --> 01:38:11,819
[SPEAKER_09]: And we did toss it out there to the members of the people who were present in the audience, and they all thought that 8 to 6 would be more appropriate.

1271
01:38:11,839 --> 01:38:15,480
[SPEAKER_09]: It would help businesses and restaurants at night and what have you.

1272
01:38:16,621 --> 01:38:18,241
[SPEAKER_09]: We took a vote, a motion.

1273
01:38:19,979 --> 01:38:28,425
[SPEAKER_09]: to go eight to six, but we have to check with the city solicitor because now we have to check the contract to see if we're in violation because the RFP called for 7 a.m.

1274
01:38:29,786 --> 01:38:31,167
[SPEAKER_09]: to 7 p.m.

1275
01:38:31,507 --> 01:38:38,492
[SPEAKER_09]: and that's 12 hours a week that we have to make sure that we're not, we can't violate the contract.

1276
01:38:38,692 --> 01:38:39,472
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the bottom line.

1277
01:38:39,492 --> 01:38:45,516
[SPEAKER_09]: So we will be checking with the city solicitor to see what the contract language allows us to amend those hours.

1278
01:38:45,576 --> 01:38:49,539
[SPEAKER_09]: But it seemed to be a strong sentiment after the business people left the room,

1279
01:38:49,963 --> 01:38:51,905
[SPEAKER_09]: that we really should be doing something at 7 a.m.

1280
01:38:52,466 --> 01:38:53,507
[SPEAKER_09]: At least on the 7 a.m.

1281
01:38:53,527 --> 01:38:54,207
[SPEAKER_09]: plan.

1282
01:38:54,227 --> 01:38:55,048
[SPEAKER_09]: 7 a.m.

1283
01:38:55,148 --> 01:38:57,631
[SPEAKER_09]: So we actually, the motion we made was 8 a.m.

1284
01:38:57,691 --> 01:38:58,492
[SPEAKER_09]: to 6 p.m.

1285
01:38:58,812 --> 01:39:00,114
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a lot more acceptable.

1286
01:39:00,214 --> 01:39:02,356
[SPEAKER_16]: We're just waiting to see what the city solicitor says.

1287
01:39:02,576 --> 01:39:03,397
[SPEAKER_16]: And one more question.

1288
01:39:05,479 --> 01:39:08,462
[SPEAKER_16]: Watson Avenue over by the Tufts garage.

1289
01:39:08,823 --> 01:39:08,983
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1290
01:39:10,145 --> 01:39:11,406
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't see any kiosks there.

1291
01:39:11,426 --> 01:39:11,866
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that a reason?

1292
01:39:11,886 --> 01:39:13,686
[SPEAKER_09]: They have to put the pad on cement.

1293
01:39:13,786 --> 01:39:16,327
[SPEAKER_09]: It's an asphalt surface on the sidewalk.

1294
01:39:16,347 --> 01:39:18,948
[SPEAKER_09]: They need to have a cement pad for the kiosks.

1295
01:39:19,349 --> 01:39:20,769
[SPEAKER_09]: The weather hasn't been agreeable.

1296
01:39:20,929 --> 01:39:30,033
[SPEAKER_09]: So that whole stretch from University Ave on both sides to College Ave, and then from College Ave all the way down.

1297
01:39:30,153 --> 01:39:32,374
[SPEAKER_16]: I saw the kiosks in the Boston Ave area.

1298
01:39:32,634 --> 01:39:33,914
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't see them on the other.

1299
01:39:34,394 --> 01:39:36,435
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't know if that was part of the other.

1300
01:39:36,655 --> 01:39:37,956
[SPEAKER_16]: They're going to be on the track side.

1301
01:39:38,900 --> 01:39:44,584
[SPEAKER_09]: from university to college, and they're going to be on the garage side from university to college.

1302
01:39:44,604 --> 01:39:46,465
[SPEAKER_09]: Will those be two-hour spots?

1303
01:39:46,505 --> 01:39:47,206
[SPEAKER_09]: They could be all day.

1304
01:39:47,226 --> 01:39:49,948
[SPEAKER_09]: They could pay $5 and be there all day.

1305
01:39:50,888 --> 01:39:56,292
[SPEAKER_09]: Because we figure that they're either staff, students, or faculty for Tufts.

1306
01:39:56,953 --> 01:39:58,794
[SPEAKER_16]: And the same thing with College Avenue as well.

1307
01:39:59,634 --> 01:40:01,716
[SPEAKER_16]: And I was in Haines Square on Friday.

1308
01:40:02,857 --> 01:40:05,258
[SPEAKER_16]: And on Yeomans, is the kiosk there?

1309
01:40:05,859 --> 01:40:06,279
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry?

1310
01:40:06,359 --> 01:40:07,520
[SPEAKER_16]: Does the kiosk on Yeomans have?

1311
01:40:08,527 --> 01:40:09,488
[SPEAKER_16]: But it's against the building.

1312
01:40:12,129 --> 01:40:13,990
[SPEAKER_16]: It's actually against the Citizens Bank building.

1313
01:40:14,010 --> 01:40:16,151
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, so it's kind of, you know, you can't.

1314
01:40:16,171 --> 01:40:18,172
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1315
01:40:19,113 --> 01:40:23,335
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure if that's going to be planned to remain there or be moved someplace else.

1316
01:40:23,415 --> 01:40:23,976
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure.

1317
01:40:24,136 --> 01:40:24,296
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1318
01:40:24,316 --> 01:40:29,539
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's say it was dark and I say, if you didn't know that it was there, um, he would just walk right by it.

1319
01:40:29,799 --> 01:40:33,961
[SPEAKER_16]: And I say, I parked on Yeomans and, uh, I kind of noticed it by accident.

1320
01:40:34,402 --> 01:40:36,443
[SPEAKER_16]: And there's really only a couple of spaces there too.

1321
01:40:36,463 --> 01:40:36,723
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's.

1322
01:40:37,274 --> 01:40:41,437
[SPEAKER_16]: And when Councilor Marks had mentioned earlier about the limitations of where the parking is.

1323
01:40:41,717 --> 01:40:50,584
[SPEAKER_16]: If you notice in Boston, they have the signs outside of the kiosk so you know that the parking stops at this sign.

1324
01:40:51,805 --> 01:40:54,187
[SPEAKER_16]: And Councilor Marks is correct.

1325
01:40:54,867 --> 01:40:59,551
[SPEAKER_16]: In Medford, are we able to park past the kiosk?

1326
01:41:00,201 --> 01:41:01,922
[SPEAKER_16]: How far down does the parking go?

1327
01:41:01,942 --> 01:41:08,267
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not— Well, in some cases, you know, the kiosk is in the middle of a block, so you have four or five spaces on either side.

1328
01:41:08,487 --> 01:41:11,650
[SPEAKER_16]: I understand what you're saying, but how far down does the space go?

1329
01:41:11,670 --> 01:41:20,256
[SPEAKER_16]: Like I say, in Boston, they have the sign ending where the last spot is, and we don't—so people may not know.

1330
01:41:20,296 --> 01:41:22,998
[SPEAKER_16]: They could just keep my pocket saying they put my money in.

1331
01:41:25,300 --> 01:41:28,923
[SPEAKER_16]: So if that—when we're looking at the signage, that might be the signage you want.

1332
01:41:29,617 --> 01:41:31,658
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, and this is where it ends, so this way people know.

1333
01:41:32,338 --> 01:41:34,920
[SPEAKER_16]: Take a look at the Boston signage and see if that's something we need.

1334
01:41:35,400 --> 01:41:42,023
[SPEAKER_16]: Like I said, I'm in Boston all the time and I see how the kiosks, but they have this, the kiosks are in the middle of the signs.

1335
01:41:43,384 --> 01:41:46,045
[SPEAKER_16]: So they have to find, they have a defined range of where they go.

1336
01:41:47,292 --> 01:41:48,672
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

1337
01:41:49,613 --> 01:41:52,213
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1338
01:41:52,873 --> 01:41:56,314
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1339
01:41:56,494 --> 01:41:57,174
[SPEAKER_14]: Chief.

1340
01:41:57,815 --> 01:41:59,775
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll be brief.

1341
01:42:00,795 --> 01:42:01,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Three quick questions.

1342
01:42:01,616 --> 01:42:04,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, President De La Russo.

1343
01:42:05,316 --> 01:42:11,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Chief, traffic commission meeting you had today, it seems like you're getting a lot of things in the agenda and getting some things resolved.

1344
01:42:12,187 --> 01:42:15,189
[SPEAKER_03]: But you do meet once a month, so there are going to be additional meetings.

1345
01:42:15,409 --> 01:42:15,829
[SPEAKER_03]: How often?

1346
01:42:15,849 --> 01:42:19,872
[SPEAKER_09]: If there may be, depending on how many new items come up, we may wait.

1347
01:42:20,352 --> 01:42:22,774
[SPEAKER_09]: Our next scheduled meeting is February 10th.

1348
01:42:23,194 --> 01:42:33,161
[SPEAKER_09]: We may have another one prior to that, depending on the number of requests, so that we don't have something that's going too lengthy on a Tuesday afternoon.

1349
01:42:33,381 --> 01:42:36,083
[SPEAKER_09]: And we may even have some nighttime meetings as well.

1350
01:42:36,363 --> 01:42:37,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I would just recommend that.

1351
01:42:37,564 --> 01:42:41,407
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I know you've addressed a number of issues, but we're getting emails and phone calls.

1352
01:42:42,200 --> 01:42:45,823
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm forwarding them to you, and I thank you for replying, replying promptly.

1353
01:42:46,283 --> 01:42:49,806
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's just so many issues out there and things that are able to be resolved.

1354
01:42:49,866 --> 01:42:53,929
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would hope that you can meet before your regularly scheduled meeting one more time.

1355
01:42:53,969 --> 01:42:59,633
[SPEAKER_09]: No, we plan, if need be, we'll meet as often as we have to between meetings to get it done.

1356
01:43:00,153 --> 01:43:09,240
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, was anything brought up at the Traffic Commission meeting regarding, we spoke about it I believe last week, if not two weeks ago, with regards to business permits?

1357
01:43:10,027 --> 01:43:14,908
[SPEAKER_03]: seasonal employees or people that may work one day a week.

1358
01:43:14,948 --> 01:43:23,050
[SPEAKER_09]: There was one business being from West Medford Square was at our meeting today and asked about that, but we're just not ready to go down that road just yet.

1359
01:43:23,330 --> 01:43:27,531
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, the a hundred dollar permit, I think was the middle ground.

1360
01:43:27,571 --> 01:43:31,272
[SPEAKER_09]: We went from the 400 for the year to the 100 and keeping it as it is.

1361
01:43:31,712 --> 01:43:36,873
[SPEAKER_09]: That's something that we will have to study, but we do have some, some,

1362
01:43:37,516 --> 01:43:44,220
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, some information that we've received from counselors and from business people, and we're just going to sort through it and see what we can come up with.

1363
01:43:44,280 --> 01:43:46,681
[SPEAKER_09]: But we weren't ready to take a vote on that today.

1364
01:43:47,021 --> 01:43:47,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1365
01:43:47,161 --> 01:43:49,322
[SPEAKER_03]: I just asked that it be round tabled and discussed.

1366
01:43:49,402 --> 01:43:52,764
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's many different options that can be thrown out there, whether.

1367
01:43:53,184 --> 01:43:59,568
[SPEAKER_09]: But I still go back to the fact, if you're a business person, you want customers to park near your business.

1368
01:44:00,048 --> 01:44:02,869
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't want to have all your employees on top of that business.

1369
01:44:03,590 --> 01:44:04,050
[SPEAKER_09]: That's, that's,

1370
01:44:04,651 --> 01:44:05,311
[SPEAKER_09]: That's critical.

1371
01:44:05,772 --> 01:44:06,872
[SPEAKER_09]: We saw that already.

1372
01:44:07,112 --> 01:44:10,554
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's part of the reason why we had the parking problem to start with.

1373
01:44:11,155 --> 01:44:13,936
[SPEAKER_09]: We had too many merchants parking in the various squares.

1374
01:44:14,437 --> 01:44:16,958
[SPEAKER_09]: And one merchant's parking in front of another merchant's shop.

1375
01:44:17,058 --> 01:44:18,879
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're all day and wouldn't move.

1376
01:44:18,939 --> 01:44:24,202
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's one thing if they're coming and going, if they're leaving during the course of their work day.

1377
01:44:24,603 --> 01:44:29,826
[SPEAKER_09]: But if they're going to be parked there all day and they don't need their vehicle, they're asking to find spots on the outskirt.

1378
01:44:30,326 --> 01:44:31,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of clarification.

1379
01:44:31,307 --> 01:44:33,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of clarification, counsel.

1380
01:44:33,912 --> 01:44:34,913
[SPEAKER_05]: on that exact question.

1381
01:44:34,973 --> 01:44:48,842
[SPEAKER_05]: So if I'm a business merchant, take West Method, for example, and I have three employees, and I won't park in front because I want to turn it over, but I'm going to go park on the parking lot behind, and it's only a three-hour window.

1382
01:44:49,342 --> 01:44:50,743
[SPEAKER_05]: But if they have a business permit.

1383
01:44:51,204 --> 01:44:53,785
[SPEAKER_05]: So each one of them has to pay $100 for a business permit?

1384
01:44:54,266 --> 01:44:54,646
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now.

1385
01:44:54,906 --> 01:44:55,727
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's what it's been.

1386
01:44:56,207 --> 01:44:58,308
[SPEAKER_09]: Counselor, it just hasn't been enforced.

1387
01:44:58,328 --> 01:45:03,612
[SPEAKER_09]: But that fee is the same fee that has been in place probably for at least five years, if not longer.

1388
01:45:04,996 --> 01:45:07,998
[SPEAKER_09]: It just wasn't enforced, so maybe many people didn't bother getting a permit.

1389
01:45:08,459 --> 01:45:08,879
[SPEAKER_05]: Excuse me.

1390
01:45:09,339 --> 01:45:09,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that a point?

1391
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:16,745
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're going to tell me that they're going to have to pay $100 there because they work at a particular store.

1392
01:45:17,866 --> 01:45:18,206
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1393
01:45:18,226 --> 01:45:18,887
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that what you're saying?

1394
01:45:18,927 --> 01:45:21,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone's treated the same because you haven't addressed that yet.

1395
01:45:21,669 --> 01:45:29,495
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can park down the end of governor's, I mean, playstate road on the Winchester line there by the for $5 a day, take a bus and go to Boston.

1396
01:45:29,695 --> 01:45:32,517
[SPEAKER_05]: What makes them any different than an employee working in a store?

1397
01:45:33,868 --> 01:45:35,689
[SPEAKER_05]: $5 a day would be $100 in a month.

1398
01:45:35,709 --> 01:45:47,251
[SPEAKER_05]: $5 a day is, you're telling that person they can stay there for $5 a day, but you're telling another person if they're going to pay $100, and if they don't pay the $100, they're going to have to pay, they're going to have to move it after three hours.

1399
01:45:48,131 --> 01:45:51,052
[SPEAKER_09]: It's $100 for the year, as opposed to $100 for the month.

1400
01:45:51,572 --> 01:45:52,973
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're giving them opportunities.

1401
01:45:52,993 --> 01:45:53,953
[SPEAKER_09]: We're giving them other spots.

1402
01:45:53,993 --> 01:45:54,573
[SPEAKER_09]: And as I said,

1403
01:45:55,496 --> 01:45:56,817
[SPEAKER_09]: There are other alternatives.

1404
01:45:57,057 --> 01:46:02,380
[SPEAKER_09]: They may have to walk a bit, but there are other alternatives that are non-restricted parking on High Street.

1405
01:46:02,521 --> 01:46:04,422
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no time limit.

1406
01:46:07,043 --> 01:46:13,868
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that should be looked into a little bit more, maybe roundtable, whether that's at your February meeting or sometime soon.

1407
01:46:14,748 --> 01:46:24,234
[SPEAKER_03]: And then my last question, with regards to the loading zones, the free spots that were put out in each district and the metered spots, how is all that being picked?

1408
01:46:25,270 --> 01:46:31,734
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of them, there really haven't been any new loading zones created except for what was already in place.

1409
01:46:32,554 --> 01:46:34,336
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of them just weren't clearly identified.

1410
01:46:34,936 --> 01:46:36,237
[SPEAKER_03]: You mentioned one right on Governor's Ave.

1411
01:46:36,257 --> 01:46:39,879
[SPEAKER_09]: That was passed today because that's a spot that's not used at all.

1412
01:46:40,379 --> 01:46:44,462
[SPEAKER_09]: So to accommodate, it's not a loading zone that's going to have a tractor trailer in it.

1413
01:46:44,642 --> 01:46:46,403
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not going to be able to accommodate that.

1414
01:46:46,963 --> 01:46:52,947
[SPEAKER_09]: But a small van or delivery, medical delivery to 0 Governor's Ave.

1415
01:46:53,563 --> 01:46:54,183
[SPEAKER_09]: They're in and out.

1416
01:46:54,644 --> 01:46:56,625
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be a legal space for them to utilize.

1417
01:46:58,527 --> 01:47:00,348
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's probably really the only new one.

1418
01:47:01,188 --> 01:47:07,633
[SPEAKER_09]: And we do anticipate a meeting with some merchants on Thursday that have requests for other, you know, for loading zone needs.

1419
01:47:07,793 --> 01:47:09,534
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're going to discuss them and take a look at it.

1420
01:47:09,955 --> 01:47:16,119
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to go on site to see the situation and kind of look at what would work and what won't work and make a recommendation from there.

1421
01:47:16,480 --> 01:47:25,324
[SPEAKER_03]: But can you give your word or guarantee that if a business, we're not picking and choosing certain businesses to have certain loading zones.

1422
01:47:25,384 --> 01:47:33,687
[SPEAKER_03]: If a business has an issue, you'll hear each business out accordingly and go to the location and hear their concerns and somehow come up with a way, whether it's.

1423
01:47:34,016 --> 01:47:44,484
[SPEAKER_09]: have 15, you know, two hours on a Monday to load in your deliveries or, you know, vice, you know, I mean, that would be ideal, but I know most of the merchants can't give you a date and time that the delivery is going to come.

1424
01:47:44,544 --> 01:47:49,047
[SPEAKER_09]: It's when the truck is loaded and wherever you are on that truck is when they make it to your shop.

1425
01:47:49,087 --> 01:47:51,669
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, we're definitely working.

1426
01:47:51,689 --> 01:47:54,351
[SPEAKER_09]: We want to work with them to, to make it work for them.

1427
01:47:55,252 --> 01:47:58,214
[SPEAKER_03]: My work for all of us, the other loading zone areas.

1428
01:47:58,254 --> 01:48:00,876
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there was the daycare, the daycares, and then,

1429
01:48:01,461 --> 01:48:03,582
[SPEAKER_03]: near Tanosh and Mr. Coffee Roasters.

1430
01:48:03,642 --> 01:48:04,843
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm meeting with them on Thursday.

1431
01:48:05,023 --> 01:48:05,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1432
01:48:05,903 --> 01:48:06,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1433
01:48:06,884 --> 01:48:07,204
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1434
01:48:07,224 --> 01:48:08,365
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Langel-Kern.

1435
01:48:08,465 --> 01:48:09,205
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight.

1436
01:48:09,825 --> 01:48:10,786
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1437
01:48:10,926 --> 01:48:11,966
[SPEAKER_14]: And I will be very brief.

1438
01:48:12,026 --> 01:48:16,008
[SPEAKER_11]: I just have a couple of questions and one request.

1439
01:48:16,128 --> 01:48:25,973
[SPEAKER_11]: And the request chief would be that during the early phases of the rollout of this parking management plan, that we move the traffic commission meetings to off hours so that people can come.

1440
01:48:26,354 --> 01:48:28,915
[SPEAKER_11]: Members of the general public who have issue or concern can come.

1441
01:48:29,675 --> 01:48:35,677
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, the, the second request chief that I have of you was, um, I believe it was last like last week or maybe the meeting before.

1442
01:48:36,137 --> 01:48:41,879
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I asked that you just describe to us what the process is to petition the traffic commission.

1443
01:48:41,919 --> 01:48:52,323
[SPEAKER_11]: If in fact there is an issue or request for action or some sort of grievance that somebody has relative to the placement of a kiosk, the placement of the placement of a spot, a sign, so on and so forth.

1444
01:48:52,343 --> 01:48:54,464
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's very important for the people to understand that.

1445
01:48:54,984 --> 01:48:57,585
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, if in fact there is an issue or grievance or a problem,

1446
01:48:57,831 --> 01:49:02,772
[SPEAKER_11]: that there is a place to go and, um, you know, that this body deliberates and does have that control and that power.

1447
01:49:03,453 --> 01:49:14,596
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um, if you'd be willing to just explain the process, it would be very simple, either a letter mailed to my attention at the police station or an email to me, L Sacco at met the police.com.

1448
01:49:15,556 --> 01:49:21,478
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and Alvaro Erickson will, we'll process it and make it an agenda item.

1449
01:49:21,878 --> 01:49:24,779
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of these items, some of these issues can be addressed over the telephone.

1450
01:49:25,499 --> 01:49:27,640
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, we may be able to make modifications that, that,

1451
01:49:28,578 --> 01:49:34,123
[SPEAKER_09]: or give advice over the phone and may not even require being added to a traffic commission agenda.

1452
01:49:34,143 --> 01:49:36,124
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's the easiest way to do it.

1453
01:49:36,164 --> 01:49:44,412
[SPEAKER_09]: And if it's something that may affect other businesses around them or other neighbors around them on a residential street, look to get some sort of a petition.

1454
01:49:45,218 --> 01:49:47,960
[SPEAKER_09]: signed by the others so that everybody's on the same page.

1455
01:49:48,381 --> 01:49:55,766
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're not doing something for one person and then next month having the opposite side coming in and saying, well, you did it for them, but it's hurting me.

1456
01:49:56,267 --> 01:50:02,351
[SPEAKER_09]: So we want to have consensus, but it's just a simple either letter, sometimes only a phone call.

1457
01:50:02,371 --> 01:50:03,672
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all it's all it's needed.

1458
01:50:03,913 --> 01:50:12,039
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's also important to point out chief that if there's a loading zone in one of our business districts that that loading zone is in for that particular business, but rather it's a loading zone for,

1459
01:50:12,452 --> 01:50:15,633
[SPEAKER_10]: vehicles that are making deliveries to park and service all the businesses.

1460
01:50:15,733 --> 01:50:15,893
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

1461
01:50:16,013 --> 01:50:16,213
[SPEAKER_09]: Correct.

1462
01:50:16,233 --> 01:50:16,774
[SPEAKER_09]: Going forward.

1463
01:50:16,794 --> 01:50:21,875
[SPEAKER_09]: That's, that's what we want to make sure if we do any new loading zones that it's, it's not specific to just one.

1464
01:50:22,356 --> 01:50:28,118
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're hoping to pick out the best location, uh, that would work for, for all involved.

1465
01:50:28,358 --> 01:50:31,499
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I said, the 30 minute spots on governor's Avenue that we added today,

1466
01:50:32,165 --> 01:50:33,306
[SPEAKER_09]: was not just for one business.

1467
01:50:33,586 --> 01:50:36,268
[SPEAKER_09]: There are three or four in that block that would be impacted.

1468
01:50:36,689 --> 01:50:38,650
[SPEAKER_09]: They could run across the street to the bank.

1469
01:50:39,071 --> 01:50:47,698
[SPEAKER_09]: They could go to one of the other businesses, whether it be the flower shop, Roland's Jewelers, any number of them for the 30 minutes in and out.

1470
01:50:49,179 --> 01:50:58,547
[SPEAKER_11]: And the last question that I have, Chief, is that I believe that you represented that the residential transaction fee for convenience when making this transaction online has been waived.

1471
01:50:59,184 --> 01:51:01,866
[SPEAKER_11]: And Mr. Nash has worked hard with the administrative authorities.

1472
01:51:01,886 --> 01:51:03,348
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Nash can address that issue.

1473
01:51:03,388 --> 01:51:09,613
[SPEAKER_09]: But yes, as a result of the discussion last week, he worked pretty hard on Friday to get that thing removed.

1474
01:51:09,693 --> 01:51:10,534
[SPEAKER_09]: So it won't be there.

1475
01:51:11,374 --> 01:51:12,495
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess my question is this.

1476
01:51:12,836 --> 01:51:15,418
[SPEAKER_11]: When can people expect to see a refund?

1477
01:51:16,219 --> 01:51:17,440
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a good question.

1478
01:51:17,860 --> 01:51:20,162
[SPEAKER_09]: But before we go there, so I can let him come up.

1479
01:51:21,512 --> 01:51:23,553
[SPEAKER_09]: You mentioned having traffic commission meetings at night.

1480
01:51:23,973 --> 01:51:29,576
[SPEAKER_09]: Just so you know, that I plan on having, like we have community meetings one Wednesday night a month, the first Wednesday of the month.

1481
01:51:30,396 --> 01:51:38,160
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably the next Wednesday night and the Wednesday night after that, I'll probably be holding hours for people to come who have concerns.

1482
01:51:38,760 --> 01:51:48,945
[SPEAKER_09]: So that it's not an official traffic commission meeting, but if people have concerns, rather than waiting for scheduling a meeting and having all the members present, I can at least hear them out.

1483
01:51:49,827 --> 01:51:53,669
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, and some, like I said, sometimes it doesn't require a vote of the, of the traffic commission.

1484
01:51:53,709 --> 01:51:53,929
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

1485
01:51:53,969 --> 01:51:57,432
[SPEAKER_09]: But I plan on next Wednesday, the next, at least the next two Wednesday nights.

1486
01:51:57,792 --> 01:51:58,232
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, great.

1487
01:51:58,272 --> 01:51:58,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1488
01:51:58,552 --> 01:51:59,873
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1489
01:51:59,913 --> 01:52:03,635
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, there were approximately 300 people that paid the convenience fee and they should get the refund by the end of the week.

1490
01:52:03,655 --> 01:52:04,236
[SPEAKER_11]: End of the week.

1491
01:52:04,476 --> 01:52:04,716
[SPEAKER_11]: Beautiful.

1492
01:52:04,736 --> 01:52:05,156
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome.

1493
01:52:05,176 --> 01:52:05,937
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Nash, thank you very much.

1494
01:52:05,977 --> 01:52:06,857
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate it.

1495
01:52:08,078 --> 01:52:08,878
[SPEAKER_18]: Point of information.

1496
01:52:08,918 --> 01:52:09,759
[SPEAKER_18]: Counsel Kamosa.

1497
01:52:10,819 --> 01:52:18,344
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, is it actually waived or was there an arrangement made with the city that the city would pick up that portion or was it just,

1498
01:52:18,791 --> 01:52:19,851
[SPEAKER_18]: In good faith, wave it.

1499
01:52:20,351 --> 01:52:20,772
[SPEAKER_18]: It's gone.

1500
01:52:21,092 --> 01:52:21,792
[SPEAKER_18]: No one's picking it up.

1501
01:52:21,812 --> 01:52:22,212
[SPEAKER_18]: No one's paying it.

1502
01:52:22,472 --> 01:52:22,732
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

1503
01:52:22,752 --> 01:52:29,494
[SPEAKER_18]: So it wasn't in lieu of the fee now that the citizens don't see the city's paying it on some other end.

1504
01:52:29,594 --> 01:52:34,736
[SPEAKER_08]: It's for any credit card payment in the office, online, for business, commuter or residential permit.

1505
01:52:34,856 --> 01:52:36,516
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no fee and no one's paying that.

1506
01:52:36,556 --> 01:52:37,337
[SPEAKER_08]: The city's not paying that.

1507
01:52:37,417 --> 01:52:37,657
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1508
01:52:37,677 --> 01:52:41,938
[SPEAKER_18]: But to be very clear, people that are using Park Mobile still will pay the fee.

1509
01:52:42,420 --> 01:52:43,561
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, that's, that's a third party.

1510
01:52:43,581 --> 01:52:48,044
[SPEAKER_18]: You just have to spell that out because people will be coming back here saying I got a fee and this and that.

1511
01:52:50,006 --> 01:52:50,626
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1512
01:52:50,646 --> 01:52:51,107
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1513
01:52:51,127 --> 01:52:52,087
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for your patience.

1514
01:52:52,147 --> 01:52:52,888
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate it.

1515
01:52:52,928 --> 01:52:53,368
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President.

1516
01:52:53,589 --> 01:52:53,949
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1517
01:52:53,989 --> 01:52:54,890
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Knight.

1518
01:52:54,910 --> 01:52:55,370
[SPEAKER_18]: You're all set.

1519
01:52:55,510 --> 01:52:55,710
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1520
01:52:56,111 --> 01:52:57,912
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Camuso and then the citizens.

1521
01:52:58,432 --> 01:53:00,014
[SPEAKER_18]: Real quick to the chief of police chief.

1522
01:53:00,694 --> 01:53:05,818
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, just two, two things on within the squares, uh, West side preschool in West Medford.

1523
01:53:06,639 --> 01:53:12,263
[SPEAKER_18]: Can you put that on the traffic commission to get drop off slash pickup for the business please at the next meeting?

1524
01:53:12,874 --> 01:53:14,554
[SPEAKER_18]: They're dealing with the same situation.

1525
01:53:15,414 --> 01:53:17,255
[SPEAKER_18]: High street people getting dropped off, picked up.

1526
01:53:17,955 --> 01:53:22,316
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully, either Thursday or Friday, I'll be able to speak with them, and I'm sure we can make accommodations.

1527
01:53:22,356 --> 01:53:22,736
[SPEAKER_09]: Excellent.

1528
01:53:22,756 --> 01:53:24,456
[SPEAKER_09]: I know we're going to make accommodations.

1529
01:53:25,076 --> 01:53:28,277
[SPEAKER_18]: And then, last but not least, the T bus stops throughout the squares.

1530
01:53:29,357 --> 01:53:37,578
[SPEAKER_18]: I think this would be the appropriate time to look at moving some of them outside of the squares, maybe, just a little bit, to free up additional spaces.

1531
01:53:39,539 --> 01:53:41,019
[SPEAKER_18]: Can you, rather than making it

1532
01:53:41,803 --> 01:53:43,804
[SPEAKER_18]: The City Council bringing recommendations forward.

1533
01:53:43,824 --> 01:53:47,246
[SPEAKER_18]: I know that in the past, there's a restaurant establishment in the square.

1534
01:53:47,646 --> 01:53:54,710
[SPEAKER_18]: This may be the time where you look at things like that so that it frees up additional parking, like the liquor store in West Medford.

1535
01:53:55,671 --> 01:53:56,731
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a bus stop there now.

1536
01:53:58,452 --> 01:53:59,413
[SPEAKER_18]: Would it make more sense?

1537
01:53:59,973 --> 01:54:03,115
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not familiar with that gentleman over there.

1538
01:54:03,135 --> 01:54:05,036
[SPEAKER_18]: He's acting strange, Chief.

1539
01:54:05,076 --> 01:54:05,336
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't.

1540
01:54:06,897 --> 01:54:07,257
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, all right.

1541
01:54:07,877 --> 01:54:09,798
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll observe proper decorum in the chamber.

1542
01:54:10,359 --> 01:54:10,659
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1543
01:54:11,332 --> 01:54:14,194
[SPEAKER_18]: It's kind of just a little odd when I was looking at the Chief.

1544
01:54:14,655 --> 01:54:30,767
[SPEAKER_18]: So anyway, Chief, as I was saying, the bus stops though, to free up additional spaces for the businesses slash consumers, I think maybe just look at it as we're doing this program to see if it makes sense to move any of them to give additional spots in certain areas.

1545
01:54:31,510 --> 01:54:37,553
[SPEAKER_09]: I know just in some of the discussion with some of the merchants, they like having the bus stop because some people utilize their services.

1546
01:54:38,134 --> 01:54:46,618
[SPEAKER_09]: But I know there's at least two bus stops that it would only matter just moving one sign to the other end.

1547
01:54:47,065 --> 01:54:49,807
[SPEAKER_09]: and you'd be freeing up a bunch of spaces.

1548
01:54:49,987 --> 01:54:55,291
[SPEAKER_09]: So two that I know of that I'll probably be putting a recommendation forward, but we'll look at all the others.

1549
01:54:55,752 --> 01:54:58,153
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's more or less just a sign change, not moving the stop.

1550
01:54:58,273 --> 01:54:59,234
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not moving the stop.

1551
01:54:59,434 --> 01:55:01,576
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's moving it to a degree, but not much.

1552
01:55:01,716 --> 01:55:03,798
[SPEAKER_09]: You're moving one of the signs to the back.

1553
01:55:05,039 --> 01:55:07,140
[SPEAKER_18]: And then that's another thing.

1554
01:55:07,380 --> 01:55:11,744
[SPEAKER_18]: There are businesses throughout the community that are within the districts that have bus stops.

1555
01:55:12,264 --> 01:55:14,666
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's the reason why they don't have a kiosk because

1556
01:55:15,267 --> 01:55:16,027
[SPEAKER_18]: of the bus stops.

1557
01:55:16,448 --> 01:55:19,990
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think people have to be cognizant of that, because people have been saying, well, why isn't this business?

1558
01:55:20,390 --> 01:55:22,631
[SPEAKER_18]: That's why you can't get into that game.

1559
01:55:22,651 --> 01:55:31,636
[SPEAKER_18]: But it is, particularly in South Medford, some of the bus stops, the reason the kiosk didn't go in certain areas is because of bus stops and limited parking as it is.

1560
01:55:32,897 --> 01:55:33,077
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1561
01:55:34,338 --> 01:55:35,979
[SPEAKER_18]: And Westside Preschool, if you can put that on there.

1562
01:55:35,999 --> 01:55:36,299
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1563
01:55:36,499 --> 01:55:37,059
[SPEAKER_14]: OK, thank you.

1564
01:55:37,700 --> 01:55:39,021
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Camuso.

1565
01:55:39,401 --> 01:55:41,442
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Chief Sacco.

1566
01:55:42,081 --> 01:55:45,623
[SPEAKER_14]: And just please state your name and address for the record, and thank you for your patience.

1567
01:55:45,783 --> 01:55:46,403
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, thank you.

1568
01:55:46,643 --> 01:55:49,525
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little late, so hopefully I can be articulate.

1569
01:55:49,965 --> 01:55:51,026
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Karen B. Tenz.

1570
01:55:51,106 --> 01:55:55,468
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the director of Riverway Counseling Associates in Medford at 10 High Street.

1571
01:55:55,968 --> 01:56:00,971
[SPEAKER_00]: We are a psychotherapy practice that's been in existence for over 20 years.

1572
01:56:01,031 --> 01:56:06,774
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been in the square a long time and have never come to you guys before.

1573
01:56:06,854 --> 01:56:08,094
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is important to me.

1574
01:56:10,475 --> 01:56:12,537
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of our clients come.

1575
01:56:12,897 --> 01:56:13,958
[SPEAKER_00]: They're only there for an hour.

1576
01:56:14,198 --> 01:56:14,718
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gone.

1577
01:56:15,939 --> 01:56:23,284
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of our clients do have mass health and other financial burdens that make it difficult for them.

1578
01:56:23,644 --> 01:56:25,205
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an added burden to them.

1579
01:56:25,345 --> 01:56:35,552
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like instead of Medford being sort of a pay-to-park community, I would recommend and suggest that you guys do an hour grace period.

1580
01:56:36,172 --> 01:56:38,894
[SPEAKER_00]: That would help alleviate

1581
01:56:39,455 --> 01:56:46,137
[SPEAKER_00]: I know maybe this has been talked about before, so if this isn't, you know, not new, please excuse me.

1582
01:56:46,177 --> 01:56:53,240
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you did an hour free and then parking after that period, that would help a lot of us in the community.

1583
01:56:53,780 --> 01:57:00,442
[SPEAKER_00]: You would eliminate this fairness of, okay, this sub shop gets 30 minutes in front and this one doesn't and such and such.

1584
01:57:00,482 --> 01:57:04,123
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you did the first hour free, come to Medford.

1585
01:57:04,203 --> 01:57:05,444
[SPEAKER_00]: You can park for an hour free.

1586
01:57:06,062 --> 01:57:09,724
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, I think that would help us and our clients a lot.

1587
01:57:11,005 --> 01:57:14,266
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one issue I wanted to bring up I think would be helpful.

1588
01:57:15,187 --> 01:57:17,768
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second one is, what if we have a client?

1589
01:57:17,808 --> 01:57:18,669
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in crisis.

1590
01:57:19,029 --> 01:57:21,590
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to stay there for longer than we imagined.

1591
01:57:22,531 --> 01:57:26,013
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want them thinking about, oh my god, I'm going to get a parking ticket.

1592
01:57:26,153 --> 01:57:27,994
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are we going to do about that?

1593
01:57:28,054 --> 01:57:28,814
[SPEAKER_00]: Who do we call?

1594
01:57:28,894 --> 01:57:29,715
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the procedure?

1595
01:57:29,735 --> 01:57:30,415
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the plan?

1596
01:57:31,956 --> 01:57:33,837
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the third piece is,

1597
01:57:36,358 --> 01:57:37,038
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot what it is.

1598
01:57:37,098 --> 01:57:37,859
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm tired.

1599
01:57:37,979 --> 01:57:40,599
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to go home now, but I, I will hope you'll consider.

1600
01:57:40,640 --> 01:57:45,281
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that's already been discussed and if that our free idea has been discussed before.

1601
01:57:45,301 --> 01:57:49,082
[SPEAKER_14]: Point of information about council along go current through the cherry.

1602
01:57:49,122 --> 01:57:51,103
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe we discussed the hour grace period.

1603
01:57:51,143 --> 01:57:52,784
[SPEAKER_03]: We made the recommendation to the mayor.

1604
01:57:52,804 --> 01:58:00,766
[SPEAKER_03]: I specifically specifically remember doing even asking for a 15 minute grace period that was asked approved by the council asked of the mayor.

1605
01:58:01,407 --> 01:58:05,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then with regards to yours, so I don't know where he is on that issue,

1606
01:58:05,543 --> 01:58:10,987
[SPEAKER_03]: And with regards to adding money to your meter, you can do it through your phone, but it's going to be a maintenance fee.

1607
01:58:11,027 --> 01:58:12,548
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, 35 cents.

1608
01:58:12,729 --> 01:58:14,230
[SPEAKER_14]: That's hard for them.

1609
01:58:14,290 --> 01:58:17,953
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to get the app myself today just to sort of see what it was.

1610
01:58:18,013 --> 01:58:24,017
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're in a crisis, you're not going to be able to figure that out if you don't already have it on your phone.

1611
01:58:24,718 --> 01:58:34,986
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe if you reached out to the traffic commission from your practice that they'll steer you in the right direction and give you the proper advice.

1612
01:58:35,387 --> 01:58:39,808
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other, you reminded me, what is it in terms of violation?

1613
01:58:39,868 --> 01:58:45,590
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the violations don't come out till later, you know, 20 days after the violation happened.

1614
01:58:46,050 --> 01:58:53,091
[SPEAKER_00]: Does someone, if their meter is up for an hour, do they get that, is it confirmed that they get an extra 15 minutes?

1615
01:58:53,111 --> 01:59:00,713
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what the story is, or if it's really in an hour, they're done, and then they're getting a $25 fine, even if they're gone for five minutes?

1616
01:59:03,478 --> 01:59:05,139
[SPEAKER_00]: That just doesn't seem really fair.

1617
01:59:05,199 --> 01:59:08,420
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, circumstances are what they are.

1618
01:59:08,440 --> 01:59:17,724
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might have an extra five minutes and expect it to be an hour, and something happens.

1619
01:59:17,844 --> 01:59:25,988
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just think there needs to be some wiggle room and some ways in which people can advocate for themselves.

1620
01:59:26,828 --> 01:59:26,928
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

1621
01:59:27,289 --> 01:59:27,549
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1622
01:59:30,927 --> 01:59:31,527
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening.

1623
01:59:31,587 --> 01:59:33,328
[SPEAKER_14]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1624
01:59:33,829 --> 01:59:34,729
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm Meryl Carlson.

1625
01:59:34,769 --> 01:59:36,850
[SPEAKER_23]: I live at 97B Boston Avenue.

1626
01:59:37,851 --> 01:59:38,971
[SPEAKER_23]: First, I brought a picture.

1627
01:59:39,372 --> 01:59:40,452
[SPEAKER_23]: It's worth a thousand words.

1628
01:59:40,472 --> 01:59:42,213
[SPEAKER_23]: There's some signage in Hillside.

1629
01:59:42,753 --> 01:59:45,295
[SPEAKER_23]: If somebody can explain to me what we're supposed to do.

1630
01:59:48,076 --> 01:59:48,496
[SPEAKER_23]: Super.

1631
01:59:56,541 --> 01:59:58,482
[SPEAKER_23]: So I'm just asking for some logic to be in

1632
01:59:59,215 --> 02:00:00,856
[SPEAKER_23]: injected into this process.

1633
02:00:01,316 --> 02:00:07,377
[SPEAKER_23]: I understand it's been a very busy time.

1634
02:00:07,397 --> 02:00:16,120
[SPEAKER_23]: But my concern as a resident of Boston Avenue between High Street and Arlington Street is that we seem to be the only unrestricted parking

1635
02:00:16,577 --> 02:00:18,439
[SPEAKER_23]: near the West Medford train station.

1636
02:00:18,519 --> 02:00:29,309
[SPEAKER_23]: As far as I can tell, Boston Avenue is not on the residential parking list, even though we are almost exclusively, if not exclusively, residential between High Street and Arlington Street.

1637
02:00:29,889 --> 02:00:36,776
[SPEAKER_23]: So if you look at a geographic circle around the train station, there are streets that are further from the train station.

1638
02:00:37,176 --> 02:00:38,337
[SPEAKER_23]: that are residential.

1639
02:00:38,657 --> 02:00:44,622
[SPEAKER_23]: And I don't understand why Boston Ave has been left unrestricted.

1640
02:00:44,682 --> 02:00:53,088
[SPEAKER_23]: We already have issues there with people like in your neighborhood, Councilor Marks, not just parking and trotting off with their briefcases, but parking and trotting off with their suitcases.

1641
02:00:53,828 --> 02:00:57,751
[SPEAKER_23]: I've had cars with out-of-state plates in front of my house for a week at a time.

1642
02:00:59,753 --> 02:01:02,515
[SPEAKER_23]: Also not able to even get out of my driveway trying to get

1643
02:01:03,327 --> 02:01:16,932
[SPEAKER_23]: Park, there's at least two people on my block that get picked up through the special needs van service from the school, and the vans have to stop in the middle of the street because they can't pull over to the side because people are parking on those streets.

1644
02:01:16,972 --> 02:01:26,495
[SPEAKER_23]: So I just want to understand the logic at the start of this if one of the concerns that we were trying to address was a commuter rail station parking usage by people out of the town.

1645
02:01:26,535 --> 02:01:29,316
[SPEAKER_23]: Why Boston Avenue is excluded from residential parking?

1646
02:01:32,917 --> 02:01:35,658
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the chief will be able to address some of those issues with you.

1647
02:01:36,318 --> 02:01:37,798
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a short answer, believe it or not.

1648
02:01:37,818 --> 02:01:38,759
[SPEAKER_09]: I won't have to go on long.

1649
02:01:39,779 --> 02:01:46,181
[SPEAKER_09]: If the residents of the street care to petition the traffic commission to make it permit parking, it's not something we impose on them.

1650
02:01:46,501 --> 02:01:50,742
[SPEAKER_09]: It's up to the residents of the street to generate a petition signed by other residents.

1651
02:01:51,303 --> 02:01:56,924
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we schedule a hearing for the traffic commission to actually implement permit parking.

1652
02:01:57,244 --> 02:01:59,125
[SPEAKER_09]: As far as the sign, that is confusing.

1653
02:01:59,605 --> 02:02:02,526
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the loading zone at Boston Avenue in front of the hardware store.

1654
02:02:03,129 --> 02:02:08,911
[SPEAKER_09]: which we just eliminated, it was six car lengths, we went to four car lengths, and there were two spaces.

1655
02:02:09,872 --> 02:02:14,574
[SPEAKER_09]: The two spaces we eliminated are supposed to be 30 minutes, and then that other signage.

1656
02:02:14,594 --> 02:02:17,115
[SPEAKER_09]: So tomorrow will be corrected, I was just told by Mr. Nash.

1657
02:02:17,595 --> 02:02:31,201
[SPEAKER_09]: But we, for Boston Avenue, if the residents of the street want to generate a petition requesting permit parking, and it doesn't have to be all day, it could be seven to noon, like some of the other streets in the area, we'd be glad to entertain it.

1658
02:02:32,335 --> 02:02:37,657
[SPEAKER_23]: So my response to that as a taxpayer in the city is I don't feel like I need to do other people's job.

1659
02:02:37,697 --> 02:02:44,620
[SPEAKER_23]: It seems very logical that that should have been included in the residential parking based on the geographic distance to the train station.

1660
02:02:44,680 --> 02:02:49,041
[SPEAKER_23]: And I don't feel like the burden should be on me to have to go around to my neighborhood.

1661
02:02:49,461 --> 02:03:00,966
[SPEAKER_23]: If you draw a line around the commuter rail, it's obvious that if you can't park on Playstead and you can't park on High Street and you can't park on Prescott or Cottage or Canal or Circuit or Bower

1662
02:03:01,546 --> 02:03:12,590
[SPEAKER_23]: or Halton or any of those other streets, then it's clear people are just going to come over and more people are going to park on Boston.

1663
02:03:12,610 --> 02:03:14,570
[SPEAKER_23]: So why should that be the citizen's burden?

1664
02:03:15,191 --> 02:03:17,331
[SPEAKER_23]: Make that logical conclusion and enforce it.

1665
02:03:20,032 --> 02:03:20,332
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1666
02:03:20,572 --> 02:03:27,955
[SPEAKER_09]: All the streets that were named, every one of those streets got permit packing through citizen generated petitions.

1667
02:03:28,466 --> 02:03:31,628
[SPEAKER_09]: As the police department and the police chief, I'm in my 25th year.

1668
02:03:32,269 --> 02:03:33,570
[SPEAKER_09]: I've made a number of mistakes.

1669
02:03:33,790 --> 02:03:38,374
[SPEAKER_09]: And one thing I'm not going to do is turn around and say, you must be permit parking.

1670
02:03:38,454 --> 02:03:40,916
[SPEAKER_09]: If the residents want it, they have to request it.

1671
02:03:41,196 --> 02:03:42,557
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a very simple process.

1672
02:03:43,037 --> 02:03:44,218
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we schedule a hearing.

1673
02:03:44,618 --> 02:03:48,461
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone from that street will be notified to attend and voice their concerns.

1674
02:03:48,521 --> 02:03:50,383
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it gets voted up or gets voted down.

1675
02:03:51,379 --> 02:03:55,822
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm not going to turn around and impose my will on any of the neighborhoods.

1676
02:03:55,982 --> 02:03:59,024
[SPEAKER_03]: With that situation, Boston Ave is so long.

1677
02:03:59,064 --> 02:04:08,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you do it by section where, I forget your name, I'm sorry, where Meryl will only have to do it in her section of the neighborhood?

1678
02:04:08,270 --> 02:04:09,051
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't have to be 100%.

1679
02:04:09,091 --> 02:04:18,377
[SPEAKER_09]: In a neighborhood like that, if you have 15, 20 names on a petition requesting it, that would be all that would be needed to get us onto the agenda.

1680
02:04:19,601 --> 02:04:22,123
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not going to do it in a neighborhood that doesn't want it.

1681
02:04:22,483 --> 02:04:23,483
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's, that's the problem.

1682
02:04:23,503 --> 02:04:28,286
[SPEAKER_09]: We've, we've done things before and had to take it back because the majority were not in favor.

1683
02:04:28,686 --> 02:04:29,607
[SPEAKER_09]: One person wanted it.

1684
02:04:29,907 --> 02:04:30,687
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone else didn't.

1685
02:04:31,248 --> 02:04:34,690
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why we have the hearing and it has to be citizen driven.

1686
02:04:35,010 --> 02:04:37,991
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not going to be the police department saying you must be permanent parking.

1687
02:04:38,372 --> 02:04:40,793
[SPEAKER_09]: And unless we go to the program and we say citywide,

1688
02:04:41,302 --> 02:04:44,365
[SPEAKER_09]: and have a comprehensive city-wide program, then that's a whole different story.

1689
02:04:44,905 --> 02:04:49,329
[SPEAKER_09]: But street by street, unfortunately, that's the way the permit parking rules have been written since the 70s.

1690
02:04:50,250 --> 02:04:52,812
[SPEAKER_09]: It's street by street, and it's by petition from the residents.

1691
02:04:53,453 --> 02:04:54,053
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Chief.

1692
02:04:54,494 --> 02:04:54,714
[SPEAKER_09]: Ma'am?

1693
02:04:55,234 --> 02:05:00,239
[SPEAKER_23]: And just in closing, while I appreciate that that's how permit parking has been done, I find it ironic.

1694
02:05:00,299 --> 02:05:04,202
[SPEAKER_23]: And I'm actually quite neutral on the metered parking at this point.

1695
02:05:04,262 --> 02:05:07,545
[SPEAKER_23]: But the idea that the citizens have to want it, and yet we're

1696
02:05:08,136 --> 02:05:16,058
[SPEAKER_23]: here for two nights now, I guess, talking about this parking system that it seems like a lot of citizens didn't want and didn't ask for, and yet it's here.

1697
02:05:16,558 --> 02:05:31,882
[SPEAKER_23]: And if you're going to make changes to other parts of the sort of parking ecosystem, one would think that the city would be able to look at the whole ecosystem of a particular neighborhood without relying on individual citizens to have to point out obvious issues that are going to come up.

1698
02:05:32,002 --> 02:05:32,422
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1699
02:05:32,442 --> 02:05:33,382
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, ma'am.

1700
02:05:35,932 --> 02:05:36,312
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening.

1701
02:05:36,372 --> 02:05:38,314
[SPEAKER_14]: My name is Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave.

1702
02:05:38,614 --> 02:05:43,719
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to thank Councilor Penta for bringing this up again.

1703
02:05:43,739 --> 02:05:46,181
[SPEAKER_14]: This is an opportunity denied us by the Mayor.

1704
02:05:59,982 --> 02:06:04,283
[SPEAKER_17]: And the citizens have a right to be outraged because we had no pushback.

1705
02:06:04,703 --> 02:06:06,064
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll do respect Chief Sacco.

1706
02:06:06,764 --> 02:06:07,784
[SPEAKER_17]: We have no access TV.

1707
02:06:07,824 --> 02:06:08,744
[SPEAKER_17]: We couldn't talk about this.

1708
02:06:08,864 --> 02:06:10,045
[SPEAKER_17]: No one knew about this.

1709
02:06:10,845 --> 02:06:15,526
[SPEAKER_17]: Few people knew I knew, but we see 12 people at the council every week.

1710
02:06:16,427 --> 02:06:18,227
[SPEAKER_17]: The citizens did not know this was coming.

1711
02:06:19,707 --> 02:06:22,828
[SPEAKER_17]: And we have 293 days before the election.

1712
02:06:22,848 --> 02:06:28,670
[SPEAKER_17]: I think the citizens have to seriously consider if they like being handed something along with the water and sewer.

1713
02:06:30,395 --> 02:06:33,116
[SPEAKER_17]: and along with the access TV rates.

1714
02:06:34,037 --> 02:06:36,898
[SPEAKER_17]: So I did a little studying today on the Internet.

1715
02:06:37,018 --> 02:06:41,840
[SPEAKER_17]: I looked into search engines, and I put parking meters, and it's astounding.

1716
02:06:41,920 --> 02:06:45,081
[SPEAKER_17]: I made it very simple for the people here in Medford.

1717
02:06:45,721 --> 02:06:46,482
[SPEAKER_17]: Very, very simple.

1718
02:06:47,422 --> 02:06:49,403
[SPEAKER_17]: You can look up South Chicago.

1719
02:06:50,263 --> 02:06:55,425
[SPEAKER_17]: Whether it's downtown or other parts of the city, seems Chicagoans' distaste for parking meters is growing.

1720
02:06:56,146 --> 02:06:59,307
[SPEAKER_17]: The issue has found its way to far southeast side communities.

1721
02:06:59,710 --> 02:07:02,332
[SPEAKER_17]: It's pitting residents and some businesses against each other.

1722
02:07:03,132 --> 02:07:10,296
[SPEAKER_17]: So I made tinyurl, so you can find them, anyone in the listening audience on TV, tinyurl.com, Chicago meters.

1723
02:07:11,016 --> 02:07:12,197
[SPEAKER_17]: Then we go to San Francisco.

1724
02:07:13,118 --> 02:07:15,319
[SPEAKER_17]: The overall message seems clear.

1725
02:07:15,839 --> 02:07:21,642
[SPEAKER_17]: Parking tickets are bad for business, deterring shoppers, diners alike from visiting the city.

1726
02:07:22,483 --> 02:07:25,425
[SPEAKER_17]: tinyurl.com, San Francisco meters.

1727
02:07:26,285 --> 02:07:27,366
[SPEAKER_17]: Oakland, California.

1728
02:07:27,906 --> 02:07:29,247
[SPEAKER_17]: And I will keep it brief.

1729
02:07:30,194 --> 02:07:31,074
[SPEAKER_17]: There's only a few here.

1730
02:07:31,235 --> 02:07:41,119
[SPEAKER_17]: But it was drowned out by businesses declaring that having to pay for parking scared off customers, attributing a decline in sales to the increased parking cost.

1731
02:07:41,480 --> 02:07:48,023
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, today in Haines Square, I went to get my coffee, and I said to the fellow behind the counter, it's a ghost town, the parking.

1732
02:07:48,283 --> 02:07:49,564
[SPEAKER_17]: He goes, why do you think?

1733
02:07:50,124 --> 02:07:51,565
[SPEAKER_17]: So the businesses are aware of this.

1734
02:07:52,543 --> 02:07:53,523
[SPEAKER_17]: People are aware of this.

1735
02:07:53,963 --> 02:07:56,984
[SPEAKER_17]: You keep looking, New Zealand, in New Zealand.

1736
02:07:57,524 --> 02:08:00,305
[SPEAKER_17]: So is the new technology scaring people away?

1737
02:08:00,325 --> 02:08:04,166
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a huge article, tinyurl.com, New Zealand parking.

1738
02:08:04,826 --> 02:08:06,707
[SPEAKER_17]: New Bedford, Mass.

1739
02:08:07,047 --> 02:08:08,367
[SPEAKER_17]: Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

1740
02:08:08,707 --> 02:08:11,228
[SPEAKER_17]: So around the country, this is being forced on citizens.

1741
02:08:11,288 --> 02:08:12,188
[SPEAKER_17]: We in Medford,

1742
02:08:13,893 --> 02:08:16,134
[SPEAKER_17]: are not given the opportunity to debate anything.

1743
02:08:16,194 --> 02:08:18,574
[SPEAKER_17]: There should have been meetings here in Alden Chambers.

1744
02:08:18,894 --> 02:08:24,276
[SPEAKER_17]: That's where the public should have had an opportunity to say to the mayor, hey, we don't like this.

1745
02:08:24,476 --> 02:08:25,316
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, hey, we love it.

1746
02:08:26,196 --> 02:08:37,859
[SPEAKER_17]: Because parking enforcement by having Medford people going around and enforcing parking that way and not these crazy meters, which I had a walk to Haines Square.

1747
02:08:37,899 --> 02:08:38,999
[SPEAKER_17]: I would not take my car.

1748
02:08:39,459 --> 02:08:40,539
[SPEAKER_17]: I know it's a grace period.

1749
02:08:40,619 --> 02:08:41,280
[SPEAKER_17]: I would not do it.

1750
02:08:41,320 --> 02:08:42,840
[SPEAKER_17]: In the freezing cold, I walked today.

1751
02:08:44,025 --> 02:08:46,546
[SPEAKER_17]: But Medford is the loser here.

1752
02:08:46,606 --> 02:08:47,946
[SPEAKER_17]: This is not a good program.

1753
02:08:48,726 --> 02:08:50,226
[SPEAKER_17]: The people have to come out and speak.

1754
02:08:50,366 --> 02:08:55,168
[SPEAKER_17]: And I thank you, Councillor Pinto, for having us here two nights, two weeks now.

1755
02:08:56,068 --> 02:08:56,928
[SPEAKER_17]: We've been able to speak.

1756
02:08:57,968 --> 02:09:01,129
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to stop because there's a lot of people that need to speak.

1757
02:09:01,669 --> 02:09:06,010
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm glad that no one said point of information, point of information like last week.

1758
02:09:06,368 --> 02:09:13,515
[SPEAKER_17]: when people were lined up and waiting to speak and the council did not respect, some councillors, some did, some did not respect the audience.

1759
02:09:13,955 --> 02:09:14,716
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much.

1760
02:09:21,883 --> 02:09:22,303
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening.

1761
02:09:22,383 --> 02:09:23,905
[SPEAKER_14]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1762
02:09:24,271 --> 02:09:26,532
[SPEAKER_27]: Anthony LaRoche, 422 High Street.

1763
02:09:27,992 --> 02:09:38,655
[SPEAKER_27]: I wanted to address something that the chief had mentioned, saying that residents in that building have off-street parking, and that's only true to some extent.

1764
02:09:38,815 --> 02:09:48,838
[SPEAKER_27]: Any of the apartments there only have one designated spot, so any household in there that has a two-vehicle household, we now have no place to put our vehicle.

1765
02:09:49,441 --> 02:10:05,634
[SPEAKER_27]: Um, this whole parking situation all became an issue back when street sweeping was implemented because they do the street sweeping on high street on both sides of the street, the same night, leaving us no place to put our vehicle for street sweeping.

1766
02:10:06,395 --> 02:10:27,963
[SPEAKER_27]: So I've had to impose on my neighbors and ask them if I can leave my vehicle on their property during this time frame and now The chief mentioned that the residents of those buildings won't be affected because we're at work all day every day So it's only going to it's only going to affect the people coming in to visit the city if I'm sick

1767
02:10:28,747 --> 02:10:33,869
[SPEAKER_27]: My daughter's sick, my wife's sick, and I have to stay home and take care of a family member.

1768
02:10:34,309 --> 02:10:38,371
[SPEAKER_27]: I have no place to put my vehicle now while I'm tending to family.

1769
02:10:41,132 --> 02:10:48,935
[SPEAKER_27]: The issue at hand, I think, could easily be resolved if the people of the building were allowed either a pass to park there.

1770
02:10:49,456 --> 02:10:55,398
[SPEAKER_27]: Our registration was put into a system where we wouldn't be ticketed if we were parked in front of the place that we reside.

1771
02:10:55,788 --> 02:10:59,330
[SPEAKER_27]: because as the chief mentioned earlier, we're at work all day.

1772
02:10:59,830 --> 02:11:06,274
[SPEAKER_27]: So if I need a day to stay home, I should be able to do so without the fear of being tagged in front of my own home.

1773
02:11:07,014 --> 02:11:09,716
[SPEAKER_27]: And I just, I thank the council for hearing me.

1774
02:11:10,096 --> 02:11:18,161
[SPEAKER_27]: I hope that the chief and the parking department can come up with a resolution for this because this has totally impeded us as residents in the building.

1775
02:11:18,521 --> 02:11:22,683
[SPEAKER_27]: And now we're stuck between a rock and a hard place with no option about.

1776
02:11:23,564 --> 02:11:23,864
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

1777
02:11:25,789 --> 02:11:28,270
[SPEAKER_14]: Point of information, Councilor Penter.

1778
02:11:28,370 --> 02:11:36,975
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the gentleman brings up a valid point, because whether it's your building or other parts of the city where the same thing might be happening, there's going to be a real major concern as it relates to that.

1779
02:11:37,015 --> 02:11:37,975
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Chief, could you answer that?

1780
02:11:38,456 --> 02:11:39,916
[SPEAKER_27]: I think he brings up a real valid point.

1781
02:11:39,976 --> 02:11:42,098
[SPEAKER_27]: I do have one other thing I wanted to mention, too.

1782
02:11:42,138 --> 02:11:43,198
[SPEAKER_27]: Excuse me.

1783
02:11:43,238 --> 02:11:54,144
[SPEAKER_27]: The Chief mentioned that that was instilled so that the bank would have parking available for their business establishment, and they, too, have parking available behind their building for customers.

1784
02:11:55,998 --> 02:11:56,298
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

1785
02:11:57,698 --> 02:11:58,219
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you, sir.

1786
02:11:59,979 --> 02:12:00,539
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure.

1787
02:12:00,559 --> 02:12:06,761
[SPEAKER_09]: I should know the answer, but I don't have the answer right now, but I believe that there was time limit parking in front of that building already.

1788
02:12:06,981 --> 02:12:07,741
[SPEAKER_09]: I might be wrong.

1789
02:12:08,381 --> 02:12:13,762
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, before the meters went in, I think there might've been because it was right there beside the bank, which is the business district.

1790
02:12:14,262 --> 02:12:18,883
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, my assumption was that they had off street parking.

1791
02:12:18,943 --> 02:12:20,244
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty good size lot.

1792
02:12:21,044 --> 02:12:21,264
[SPEAKER_09]: You know,

1793
02:12:22,320 --> 02:12:23,940
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what to advise at this point.

1794
02:12:23,960 --> 02:12:26,221
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd have to take a look at it now based on what I'm hearing.

1795
02:12:26,901 --> 02:12:28,401
[SPEAKER_09]: It certainly changes the dynamics.

1796
02:12:33,122 --> 02:12:33,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Pinto.

1797
02:12:33,862 --> 02:12:36,462
[SPEAKER_05]: You indicated that you would be listening to what the people are saying.

1798
02:12:36,782 --> 02:12:37,243
[SPEAKER_05]: I am.

1799
02:12:37,303 --> 02:12:37,823
[SPEAKER_09]: I wrote it down.

1800
02:12:37,983 --> 02:12:38,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1801
02:12:38,283 --> 02:12:40,363
[SPEAKER_05]: Under advisement, because I think he makes a valid point.

1802
02:12:40,703 --> 02:12:44,724
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, unfortunately, you know, what if somebody is sick in the family?

1803
02:12:44,744 --> 02:12:45,584
[SPEAKER_05]: What are they going to do?

1804
02:12:45,604 --> 02:12:45,824
[SPEAKER_05]: Park?

1805
02:12:46,004 --> 02:12:46,864
[SPEAKER_05]: They can't park in front?

1806
02:12:46,964 --> 02:12:49,345
[SPEAKER_05]: And if there's no spots in the back, what's he going to have to do?

1807
02:12:49,385 --> 02:12:51,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Run out every two hours and move his car?

1808
02:12:52,749 --> 02:12:53,630
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I would say that.

1809
02:12:53,710 --> 02:12:54,630
[SPEAKER_05]: On Saturdays, too?

1810
02:12:54,690 --> 02:12:55,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Saturdays?

1811
02:12:55,031 --> 02:12:56,832
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Saturday might be a different problem.

1812
02:12:56,852 --> 02:12:57,573
[SPEAKER_05]: This is crazy.

1813
02:12:57,613 --> 02:12:58,053
[SPEAKER_09]: Saturdays.

1814
02:12:58,393 --> 02:13:04,398
[SPEAKER_09]: But during the week, if he has to stay home during the week, I'm sure there's other spots in the lot that he could be in during the day.

1815
02:13:04,818 --> 02:13:12,644
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm, well, that's something to work out with the landlord and other tenants, maybe neighbors, to see if you can use their spot.

1816
02:13:12,664 --> 02:13:14,165
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm looking at it.

1817
02:13:14,245 --> 02:13:15,446
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to be negative about this.

1818
02:13:15,486 --> 02:13:16,467
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to have to look at it.

1819
02:13:16,607 --> 02:13:18,448
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't make the decision on this this evening.

1820
02:13:19,229 --> 02:13:19,749
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Chief.

1821
02:13:22,548 --> 02:13:28,209
[SPEAKER_27]: Again, I'm being asked to impose on my neighbors a simple solution.

1822
02:13:28,590 --> 02:13:35,251
[SPEAKER_27]: Allow the people that live in that building to park in front of that house without repercussion and there wouldn't be an issue.

1823
02:13:36,371 --> 02:13:41,193
[SPEAKER_27]: As far as you mentioned that timed parking has been implemented there.

1824
02:13:41,373 --> 02:13:43,573
[SPEAKER_27]: I've lived in that building for 15 years.

1825
02:13:43,933 --> 02:13:46,594
[SPEAKER_27]: I've never had an issue parking in front of that building.

1826
02:13:46,974 --> 02:13:51,355
[SPEAKER_27]: Never been tagged for it unless I left my vehicle there for street sweeping.

1827
02:13:51,695 --> 02:13:53,195
[SPEAKER_27]: And I've lived there 15 years.

1828
02:13:54,056 --> 02:13:56,937
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's part of the problem because there's been so little enforcement.

1829
02:13:56,957 --> 02:14:00,138
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's why we're going down the road we're on right now.

1830
02:14:01,918 --> 02:14:02,418
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's not.

1831
02:14:02,918 --> 02:14:06,539
[SPEAKER_09]: It's, you know, it's something that happened and that's the way it is today.

1832
02:14:06,599 --> 02:14:10,220
[SPEAKER_09]: It's, it's changing, but I have the name, I have the address.

1833
02:14:10,300 --> 02:14:13,141
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll look into it and see what modifications we can make.

1834
02:14:13,501 --> 02:14:14,082
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, chief.

1835
02:14:16,602 --> 02:14:17,042
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening.

1836
02:14:17,122 --> 02:14:18,763
[SPEAKER_14]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1837
02:14:18,997 --> 02:14:19,377
[SPEAKER_20]: Good evening.

1838
02:14:19,477 --> 02:14:20,198
[SPEAKER_20]: My name is D.J.

1839
02:14:20,218 --> 02:14:23,801
[SPEAKER_20]: Davenango, owner of Dabbs Lock 470 High Street in West Medford.

1840
02:14:24,261 --> 02:14:32,768
[SPEAKER_20]: I again would like to thank the council for giving me the opportunity to address you this evening for the third council meeting in a row on a major issue taking part in the city of Medford.

1841
02:14:33,148 --> 02:14:37,772
[SPEAKER_20]: Some of the issues I'm going to talk about have already been briefly covered, but I'm going to hit them home again tonight.

1842
02:14:38,890 --> 02:14:44,273
[SPEAKER_20]: The issue is the Revenue Enhancement Program, sorry, I meant to say the Parking Enforcement Program.

1843
02:14:44,813 --> 02:14:54,018
[SPEAKER_20]: I am here again 21 days after my initial addressing to the Council as because many of the reasonable questions I have asked have fallen on deaf ears and gone unanswered.

1844
02:14:54,038 --> 02:15:02,683
[SPEAKER_20]: This program was based on a study conducted in 2009 and doesn't solve any problems but create new ones by driving our customers away.

1845
02:15:03,564 --> 02:15:05,705
[SPEAKER_20]: Since the installation of kiosks in West Medford,

1846
02:15:06,098 --> 02:15:10,561
[SPEAKER_20]: Both area businesses and I have noticed a slight drop off in walk-in traffic.

1847
02:15:11,362 --> 02:15:19,608
[SPEAKER_20]: Once the enforcement is in full swing and tickets are being issued, that will drive the remaining customers away to where they can park for free.

1848
02:15:20,629 --> 02:15:25,793
[SPEAKER_20]: The first time I spoke, I inquired as to what would happen for businesses that have multiple individuals working for them.

1849
02:15:26,700 --> 02:15:30,261
[SPEAKER_20]: Would there be some relief, or would they be forced to purchase multiple business permits?

1850
02:15:30,601 --> 02:15:35,623
[SPEAKER_20]: Many of those businesses, like mine, have multiple employees working on a part-time, seasonal basis.

1851
02:15:36,203 --> 02:15:42,445
[SPEAKER_20]: How can a city that has a surplus of over $15 million ask a business to keep paying more and more than they already do?

1852
02:15:43,541 --> 02:15:49,426
[SPEAKER_20]: When I went into the Republic office last Monday the 5th to purchase my business permit, I became very upset at what I had learned.

1853
02:15:50,267 --> 02:15:56,732
[SPEAKER_20]: There were area residents already in line waiting to purchase their residential parking permits so they can park in front of their own houses.

1854
02:15:58,033 --> 02:16:03,418
[SPEAKER_20]: For a minimal $10 fee, they received their permit and were told two visitor permits would be sent to them via mail.

1855
02:16:04,098 --> 02:16:09,083
[SPEAKER_20]: So essentially, that breaks down to three permits for $10 a year, just above $0.27 a month per permit.

1856
02:16:09,103 --> 02:16:09,463
[SPEAKER_20]: Now my turn.

1857
02:16:12,244 --> 02:16:20,211
[SPEAKER_20]: I gave the Republic employee my check for $100 so I can park in a lot behind my business, and then I went to inquire when I would be receiving my visitor permits.

1858
02:16:20,731 --> 02:16:22,653
[SPEAKER_20]: I was informed, well, it doesn't work that way.

1859
02:16:23,093 --> 02:16:23,593
[SPEAKER_20]: Why not?

1860
02:16:24,114 --> 02:16:30,579
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm paying 10 times as much for my permit, which does not even guarantee me a spot behind my business, and I get nothing in return.

1861
02:16:31,200 --> 02:16:37,084
[SPEAKER_20]: Why couldn't the business permit be in the form of a movable placard that could change vehicles as needed for employees to share?

1862
02:16:37,985 --> 02:16:40,207
[SPEAKER_20]: Nobody at the Republic office could answer that question.

1863
02:16:40,689 --> 02:16:55,776
[SPEAKER_20]: or what I should do if I need to have a temporary vehicle for myself due to my service vehicle being at the mechanic for maintenance, and questions about my four-hour-a-week worker and my worker who comes in now two days a week and then three months over the summer, what I should do for them.

1864
02:16:56,737 --> 02:17:05,521
[SPEAKER_20]: Even if I have to pay the normal rate for a permit, why can't it be a movable placard or allow me to add multiple plates to my existing permit?

1865
02:17:06,836 --> 02:17:10,979
[SPEAKER_20]: The rollout of this program, as I can see, was done with the cookie-cutter approach.

1866
02:17:11,560 --> 02:17:14,222
[SPEAKER_20]: The same exact plan was done for each of the business districts.

1867
02:17:14,622 --> 02:17:18,605
[SPEAKER_20]: There is no justifiable way you can compare any of the two business districts alike.

1868
02:17:19,086 --> 02:17:25,050
[SPEAKER_20]: Medford Square has law offices, dentists, and many other businesses in which parking spot turnover is needed.

1869
02:17:25,611 --> 02:17:34,458
[SPEAKER_20]: In West Medford, the Hillside, Haines Square, and South Medford, there are a multitude of in-and-out businesses, businesses that customers may not spend more than two to five minutes in them.

1870
02:17:35,031 --> 02:17:39,653
[SPEAKER_20]: Where I'm in West Medford, there's a dog groomer, dry cleaner, and many places to get takeout food.

1871
02:17:40,253 --> 02:17:45,515
[SPEAKER_20]: Most of the times, the customers don't even shut off their cars for that quick in and out it takes to conduct their business.

1872
02:17:46,475 --> 02:17:47,615
[SPEAKER_20]: I have been told not to worry.

1873
02:17:47,956 --> 02:17:49,996
[SPEAKER_20]: Customers are loyal, and they'll adapt to change.

1874
02:17:51,697 --> 02:17:54,318
[SPEAKER_20]: Let me speak briefly about customer loyalty and retention.

1875
02:17:54,818 --> 02:17:59,960
[SPEAKER_20]: About two years ago, I raised my service call rate $2.50 to help cover the rising costs of my business.

1876
02:18:00,870 --> 02:18:11,473
[SPEAKER_20]: That year, I had two landlords and a property management company decide they could no longer do business with my company because of the outrageous price increase, a rate which I had not raised in five years.

1877
02:18:12,373 --> 02:18:18,235
[SPEAKER_20]: Up until April of last year, I had been a frequent patron of the 99 in Somerville, going down there two to four times a week.

1878
02:18:19,015 --> 02:18:22,936
[SPEAKER_20]: They repeatedly made changes to their menu and how they operated, which I didn't agree with.

1879
02:18:23,456 --> 02:18:27,777
[SPEAKER_20]: The final straw was their remodeling of the family-style restaurant and turning it into a sports bar.

1880
02:18:28,322 --> 02:18:30,844
[SPEAKER_20]: tearing down walls, making an open concept restaurant.

1881
02:18:31,264 --> 02:18:33,246
[SPEAKER_20]: Since the remodel, I have yet to return.

1882
02:18:33,947 --> 02:18:39,671
[SPEAKER_20]: In my 10 years of being self-employed, in my four years of retail prior, all have taught me one central thing.

1883
02:18:40,131 --> 02:18:42,894
[SPEAKER_20]: Customers are funny and never take their loyalty for granted.

1884
02:18:43,914 --> 02:18:49,639
[SPEAKER_20]: I have heard on multiple occasions that this program will come under review in 60 days from its start.

1885
02:18:50,540 --> 02:18:52,221
[SPEAKER_20]: 60 days from the start puts us at St.

1886
02:18:52,261 --> 02:18:53,182
[SPEAKER_20]: Patrick's Day in March.

1887
02:18:54,181 --> 02:19:05,089
[SPEAKER_20]: I am highly concerned that in those 60 days, irreversible damage will be done to the small businesses in our community, and more will simply have to close their doors for good, like wards and bestsellers in the square.

1888
02:19:06,450 --> 02:19:15,057
[SPEAKER_20]: These small mom-and-pop shops build their businesses over many years, and decades even, and now, in the blink of an eye, the city could be left with more empty storefronts.

1889
02:19:15,838 --> 02:19:22,883
[SPEAKER_20]: If a customer feels inconvenienced by having to interact with these kiosks or worse, gets a violation for being a minute or two over their limit,

1890
02:19:23,388 --> 02:19:30,714
[SPEAKER_20]: The city will simply push them away, away to Assembly Row, Arlington, Winchester, Stoneham, and many more free parking business districts.

1891
02:19:31,755 --> 02:19:38,340
[SPEAKER_20]: In West Medford, where I am, you have a lock shop, a hair salon, a dog groomer, places to eat, a nail salon, and a convenience store.

1892
02:19:39,020 --> 02:19:42,423
[SPEAKER_20]: Just two miles down the road on Salem Street, between Paris and Park,

1893
02:19:42,947 --> 02:19:48,310
[SPEAKER_20]: You have a lock shop, a hair salon, a dog groomer, places to eat, a nail salon, and a convenience store.

1894
02:19:48,890 --> 02:19:55,213
[SPEAKER_20]: Why do their customers, employees, and business owners get to park all day for free while West Medford will have aggressive enforcement?

1895
02:19:55,673 --> 02:19:58,995
[SPEAKER_20]: If that does not define discrimination, I don't know what does.

1896
02:19:59,435 --> 02:20:06,499
[SPEAKER_20]: And at that rate, how about the 30-plus stores on Salem Street between Grand Ave and the Rotary who have free parking?

1897
02:20:07,030 --> 02:20:10,113
[SPEAKER_20]: or the strip of stores on Middlesex Ave., who also have free parking.

1898
02:20:10,834 --> 02:20:15,518
[SPEAKER_20]: I recently spoke to a business owner who had his business in the 300 block of Salem Street.

1899
02:20:16,099 --> 02:20:22,045
[SPEAKER_20]: He told me about the parking issue he had over there, with people parking there all day and jumping on the buses to work.

1900
02:20:22,625 --> 02:20:27,350
[SPEAKER_20]: And if you talk to the Chamber of Commerce, that is what they will tell you is the main concern in all the business districts.

1901
02:20:28,011 --> 02:20:30,253
[SPEAKER_20]: In West Medford, that couldn't be further from the truth.

1902
02:20:30,733 --> 02:20:38,555
[SPEAKER_20]: The cars that park in West Medford, either on High Street or the municipal lot, are those of our customers, business owners, and employees, not the commuters.

1903
02:20:39,196 --> 02:20:43,477
[SPEAKER_20]: People who take the train and bus from West Medford live in the immediate area and walk to the stops.

1904
02:20:43,937 --> 02:20:46,758
[SPEAKER_20]: I know that for a fact, and I encourage anyone to prove me wrong.

1905
02:20:47,612 --> 02:20:51,354
[SPEAKER_20]: The chamber goes on to say that this is the best solution for businesses in Medford.

1906
02:20:51,834 --> 02:20:55,355
[SPEAKER_20]: Please come down to West Medford and ask, how many businesses want this?

1907
02:20:56,036 --> 02:21:01,798
[SPEAKER_20]: I quote a business owner in saying, we had no choice and we had no voice when it came to park enforcement.

1908
02:21:02,278 --> 02:21:13,463
[SPEAKER_20]: The chamber should have done more to work with the individual business districts to see what would have been feasible to reach a favorable outcome for those involved, not just push this program down our throats.

1909
02:21:14,331 --> 02:21:18,735
[SPEAKER_20]: Of course, $18 million over a 10-year span sounds like a phenomenal thing.

1910
02:21:19,155 --> 02:21:19,856
[SPEAKER_20]: But think about it.

1911
02:21:20,376 --> 02:21:21,958
[SPEAKER_20]: Where exactly is that money coming from?

1912
02:21:22,598 --> 02:21:24,360
[SPEAKER_20]: It's coming from the pockets of our customers.

1913
02:21:24,960 --> 02:21:29,805
[SPEAKER_20]: Our customers who, when they woke up, had a choice to support the Medford business community that day.

1914
02:21:30,525 --> 02:21:31,826
[SPEAKER_20]: Now they will just go elsewhere.

1915
02:21:32,347 --> 02:21:40,594
[SPEAKER_20]: Because of the Chamber's apparent inability to work with small businesses in our community, I am rescinding my membership tonight until I feel the Chamber can fight for small businesses.

1916
02:21:41,139 --> 02:21:45,381
[SPEAKER_20]: The backbone of this city's economy, according to a statement the mayor made in January of 2012.

1917
02:21:46,802 --> 02:21:52,925
[SPEAKER_20]: I should not have to be here for three consecutive meetings fighting a fight the Chamber of Commerce should be fighting for all small businesses.

1918
02:21:53,465 --> 02:21:57,187
[SPEAKER_20]: I have better things to do than speak here at this podium on Tuesday nights.

1919
02:21:58,747 --> 02:22:03,049
[SPEAKER_20]: I have heard talks about the validation program to help with the issue of needing additional time.

1920
02:22:03,650 --> 02:22:04,470
[SPEAKER_20]: As it appears to me,

1921
02:22:05,678 --> 02:22:14,563
[SPEAKER_20]: What this is going to do now is pit businesses against each other, whether it's this validation program or allowing free time at some businesses while requiring the pay to park at others.

1922
02:22:15,203 --> 02:22:20,246
[SPEAKER_20]: Additionally, there has been no solution as to the multitude of delivery vehicles that keep the businesses open and operating.

1923
02:22:20,806 --> 02:22:29,031
[SPEAKER_20]: I've heard everything from they will be left alone as long as they park safely, they will be ticketed unless they pay like everyone else, or the best response I keep hearing, we're not sure.

1924
02:22:29,791 --> 02:22:32,333
[SPEAKER_20]: There are a lot of answers that are still needed and deserved.

1925
02:22:33,272 --> 02:22:42,080
[SPEAKER_20]: It astonishes me that back on December 22nd, conversations took place within the city and in just 24 hours later, the on street parking was increased by an hour.

1926
02:22:42,510 --> 02:22:44,330
[SPEAKER_20]: and the business permit fee was lowered back to $100.

1927
02:22:45,591 --> 02:22:49,411
[SPEAKER_20]: What this shows me is things are still not set in stone and can be worked out.

1928
02:22:49,891 --> 02:22:53,372
[SPEAKER_20]: The enforcement contract may be signed, but the city can still make changes.

1929
02:22:53,972 --> 02:23:00,093
[SPEAKER_20]: Why can't Medford continue to work with small businesses and hash out the details of what will work best in the individual business districts?

1930
02:23:00,813 --> 02:23:05,074
[SPEAKER_20]: Saying they are all the same is like saying the different Boston communities are all the same.

1931
02:23:05,614 --> 02:23:06,714
[SPEAKER_20]: Enough is enough, Medford.

1932
02:23:07,254 --> 02:23:10,655
[SPEAKER_20]: Work with the small businesses or you will force us into communities that will.

1933
02:23:11,861 --> 02:23:14,722
[SPEAKER_20]: I am in a very different situation from my neighbors in West Medford.

1934
02:23:15,142 --> 02:23:18,584
[SPEAKER_20]: Only around 10% of my weekly sales comes from my walk-in traffic.

1935
02:23:19,004 --> 02:23:22,666
[SPEAKER_20]: The rest comes from the service work I perform at homes and businesses during the week.

1936
02:23:23,206 --> 02:23:28,888
[SPEAKER_20]: If I did not have that service business that I do, there'd be no possible way for me to survive on walk-in traffic alone.

1937
02:23:29,448 --> 02:23:35,411
[SPEAKER_20]: Every other business in West Medford and the rest of the city relies solely on people coming through their front door.

1938
02:23:35,851 --> 02:23:39,112
[SPEAKER_20]: Please think of that when you consider playing chance with customer loyalty.

1939
02:23:40,193 --> 02:23:40,733
[SPEAKER_20]: In closing,

1940
02:23:41,151 --> 02:23:46,434
[SPEAKER_20]: There's still more work to be done, work that should have been done with more than just hours until enforcement starts.

1941
02:23:46,935 --> 02:23:54,739
[SPEAKER_20]: Medford needs to continue to work with the needs of small businesses, or Medford will become a city of Dunkin' Donuts, car dealerships, banks, and empty storefronts.

1942
02:23:55,120 --> 02:23:55,900
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for your time.

1943
02:24:04,886 --> 02:24:08,428
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, please step forward if you'd like and state your name and address for the record.

1944
02:24:10,952 --> 02:24:12,093
[SPEAKER_24]: My name is Micah Goolsby.

1945
02:24:13,013 --> 02:24:14,074
[SPEAKER_24]: I live at 465 High Street.

1946
02:24:15,335 --> 02:24:18,997
[SPEAKER_24]: I am here because I live at 465 High Street.

1947
02:24:20,158 --> 02:24:23,400
[SPEAKER_24]: And my fiance and I both work from home.

1948
02:24:23,901 --> 02:24:29,084
[SPEAKER_24]: And so I'm wondering, because right now we park on the side street during the day.

1949
02:24:31,025 --> 02:24:34,467
[SPEAKER_24]: And sometimes we park in front, but it's only when we know we're going to leave.

1950
02:24:35,088 --> 02:24:38,250
[SPEAKER_24]: But what happens if you end up?

1951
02:24:38,738 --> 02:24:46,563
[SPEAKER_24]: instituting only residential parking and for the streets that we live on, because we live on High Street.

1952
02:24:46,783 --> 02:24:49,765
[SPEAKER_24]: So what is the plan as far as that goes?

1953
02:24:51,886 --> 02:24:54,828
[SPEAKER_14]: If maybe the chief will address that.

1954
02:24:55,728 --> 02:24:57,349
[SPEAKER_18]: Point of information, Councilor Camuso.

1955
02:24:57,789 --> 02:24:59,730
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm very glad you brought this up.

1956
02:25:00,891 --> 02:25:04,113
[SPEAKER_18]: A few minutes ago, we had a young lady at the podium

1957
02:25:04,493 --> 02:25:10,197
[SPEAKER_18]: and discussing making her street, just the city with the wave of a lawn, make her street resident parking.

1958
02:25:10,798 --> 02:25:16,963
[SPEAKER_18]: This is exactly the reason why the city doesn't want to do it without community input.

1959
02:25:18,184 --> 02:25:32,915
[SPEAKER_18]: This is a perfect example and I feel, excuse me, I definitely understand your concerns and this is why if a certain neighbourhood wants to institute resident parking, the whole neighbourhood's notified

1960
02:25:35,583 --> 02:25:36,283
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you very much.

1961
02:25:36,323 --> 02:25:38,165
[SPEAKER_18]: And the chief will address your concerns.

1962
02:25:38,485 --> 02:25:38,805
I'm sure.

1963
02:25:39,566 --> 02:25:39,926
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1964
02:25:40,126 --> 02:25:47,711
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, what we've had is a number of residents from four 65 high, uh, faced with the same problem right above the stores.

1965
02:25:48,571 --> 02:25:54,355
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, there's the road is open on Warren street between high street and, and Irving street.

1966
02:25:54,435 --> 02:25:58,758
[SPEAKER_09]: But in many days that is already jam packed with vehicles just from Warren street alone.

1967
02:25:58,858 --> 02:26:00,799
[SPEAKER_09]: So we know that that's not an option.

1968
02:26:01,281 --> 02:26:13,006
[SPEAKER_09]: but today at the traffic commission, we did have a petition from a resident of four 65 high for a variance to park on a nearby street and it was granted because of the hardship.

1969
02:26:13,147 --> 02:26:19,069
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would just ask that you submit a request for a variance for a nearby street for your vehicle.

1970
02:26:19,089 --> 02:26:25,232
[SPEAKER_09]: And that would in all likelihood be approved because we realized you can't park all day on high street.

1971
02:26:25,692 --> 02:26:27,073
[SPEAKER_09]: So you do need some help.

1972
02:26:27,598 --> 02:26:29,439
[SPEAKER_09]: And Warren Street does get jammed up.

1973
02:26:29,500 --> 02:26:36,745
[SPEAKER_09]: And I wouldn't be surprised if, in the not too distant future, they'll be in looking for parking as well.

1974
02:26:38,607 --> 02:26:38,947
[SPEAKER_09]: You're welcome.

1975
02:26:39,107 --> 02:26:39,447
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1976
02:26:40,748 --> 02:26:43,390
[SPEAKER_24]: And for the record, I agree with all of the comments that were made tonight.

1977
02:26:43,630 --> 02:26:48,094
[SPEAKER_24]: I think that paid parking is really, really bad for the businesses.

1978
02:26:49,855 --> 02:26:52,077
[SPEAKER_24]: There's a restaurant called Paul Revere.

1979
02:26:52,277 --> 02:26:53,298
[SPEAKER_24]: And a lot of people go in there.

1980
02:26:54,134 --> 02:27:03,137
[SPEAKER_24]: And yeah, some people stay, or some people go in for just a few minutes, but other people go in and they stay, and it's like a community there.

1981
02:27:03,577 --> 02:27:12,560
[SPEAKER_24]: The thing about West Medford, the thing that's so magical about it, is that it's really a very, very strong community with very strong bonds.

1982
02:27:12,620 --> 02:27:19,762
[SPEAKER_24]: And the thing that I hear from all of the business owners is that paid parking starts to undermine that community.

1983
02:27:20,205 --> 02:27:21,846
[SPEAKER_24]: by forcing people to be hurried.

1984
02:27:22,006 --> 02:27:25,168
[SPEAKER_24]: West Medford is one of the few places where things aren't hurried.

1985
02:27:26,068 --> 02:27:30,731
[SPEAKER_24]: And so, yeah, just I'm asking that the council please keep that in mind as well.

1986
02:27:30,811 --> 02:27:31,131
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1987
02:27:31,551 --> 02:27:31,991
Thank you.

1988
02:27:39,916 --> 02:27:40,156
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi.

1989
02:27:40,276 --> 02:27:40,716
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening.

1990
02:27:40,776 --> 02:27:42,277
[SPEAKER_14]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1991
02:27:42,297 --> 02:27:45,939
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm Jimmy Spirakis, and I own Jimmy's Pizza also.

1992
02:27:46,584 --> 02:27:51,266
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm the landlord of a series in Bank 501 to 509A High Street.

1993
02:27:52,306 --> 02:27:54,967
[SPEAKER_26]: And I talk about the mirror in front of my building.

1994
02:27:56,467 --> 02:28:02,529
[SPEAKER_26]: And like I say last week, I disagree with the mirror at all.

1995
02:28:02,889 --> 02:28:06,791
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't talk in two hours or three hours, whatever I hear.

1996
02:28:06,811 --> 02:28:10,532
[SPEAKER_26]: I think it's very bad for the small businesses.

1997
02:28:11,562 --> 02:28:12,102
[SPEAKER_26]: very bad.

1998
02:28:12,943 --> 02:28:18,926
[SPEAKER_26]: Already, I say last week, we're about 12, 14% of business, small businesses around the West.

1999
02:28:19,066 --> 02:28:20,366
[SPEAKER_25]: Can I speak for one moment?

2000
02:28:20,486 --> 02:28:20,767
[SPEAKER_26]: Sure.

2001
02:28:21,107 --> 02:28:24,989
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm Victoria and I work right next to Jimmy's and this is what he wants to say.

2002
02:28:25,669 --> 02:28:30,451
[SPEAKER_25]: There's a bank, there's a tailor, there's a pastry shop, and there's a sub shop.

2003
02:28:30,791 --> 02:28:39,216
[SPEAKER_25]: People run in and they run out and they're not going to come and they're not going to put a quarter in the meter to buy the sub or to buy the $1.50 pastry.

2004
02:28:40,712 --> 02:28:41,653
[SPEAKER_25]: to go into the tailors.

2005
02:28:42,653 --> 02:28:45,115
[SPEAKER_25]: And customers have said that they'll go elsewhere.

2006
02:28:45,835 --> 02:28:55,041
[SPEAKER_25]: So it could be 15-minute parking or 30-minute parking enforced, but to have the meter there, it's going to kill the businesses on the block.

2007
02:28:56,061 --> 02:28:59,883
[SPEAKER_26]: I have another three and a half pages this week.

2008
02:29:00,044 --> 02:29:04,866
[SPEAKER_26]: People call me and they come over and say, Jimmy, we tried to support your business.

2009
02:29:05,687 --> 02:29:06,207
[SPEAKER_26]: You're nice.

2010
02:29:09,190 --> 02:29:11,231
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, I don't think it's a good idea.

2011
02:29:12,052 --> 02:29:19,236
[SPEAKER_26]: And people, the last 10 days since the mirror started, everybody thinks the mirror is not activated.

2012
02:29:19,396 --> 02:29:19,716
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know.

2013
02:29:19,756 --> 02:29:20,356
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm not sure.

2014
02:29:21,577 --> 02:29:23,378
[SPEAKER_26]: It's in the front of the tailor shop.

2015
02:29:23,958 --> 02:29:26,039
[SPEAKER_26]: And today they call me over.

2016
02:29:26,059 --> 02:29:31,402
[SPEAKER_26]: I said, Jimmy, as soon as my list is up, I don't think I got to stay.

2017
02:29:32,463 --> 02:29:36,085
[SPEAKER_26]: So I see them every day since people stop, they go to the

2018
02:29:36,750 --> 02:29:45,073
[SPEAKER_26]: machine there, they try, they spend three, four minutes, and then they take the car, put the wallet in, and leave, because they don't know how to operate.

2019
02:29:45,734 --> 02:29:46,434
[SPEAKER_26]: They stay there.

2020
02:29:46,454 --> 02:29:50,356
[SPEAKER_26]: It's just about 40, 50 people today, it counts.

2021
02:29:51,096 --> 02:29:53,697
[SPEAKER_26]: I told them to come with me, but it was something else to do.

2022
02:29:54,737 --> 02:29:58,739
[SPEAKER_26]: So, I don't think it's going to work for us.

2023
02:29:59,499 --> 02:30:02,881
[SPEAKER_26]: Plus, down the street, for me, we said again last week, it's no mirror.

2024
02:30:03,441 --> 02:30:06,462
[SPEAKER_26]: My wife, they see more, about 25 cars this week.

2025
02:30:07,200 --> 02:30:08,641
[SPEAKER_26]: They stop and go.

2026
02:30:09,701 --> 02:30:15,584
[SPEAKER_26]: The lunch was nothing, Saturday, Monday, and today.

2027
02:30:16,985 --> 02:30:17,786
[SPEAKER_26]: Please welcome.

2028
02:30:17,846 --> 02:30:21,007
[SPEAKER_25]: You can stay in my place.

2029
02:30:21,027 --> 02:30:27,571
[SPEAKER_26]: I have a lunch with me, and you see, not even 15 customers today for lunch.

2030
02:30:28,091 --> 02:30:35,335
[SPEAKER_26]: I can come, I get a computer, I can print a slip to give it to you, Mr. President, and you see the lunch we do today.

2031
02:30:36,020 --> 02:30:38,442
[SPEAKER_26]: We can be able to pay, never mind the gas.

2032
02:30:40,043 --> 02:30:44,127
[SPEAKER_26]: The gas is $900 a month, another $750 electricity.

2033
02:30:44,147 --> 02:30:46,589
[SPEAKER_26]: Plus, everything goes up.

2034
02:30:46,649 --> 02:30:48,751
[SPEAKER_26]: We get the license for the city.

2035
02:30:49,532 --> 02:30:50,072
[SPEAKER_26]: It's $175.

2036
02:30:52,674 --> 02:30:54,156
[SPEAKER_26]: We pay for dumpster.

2037
02:30:54,436 --> 02:30:56,017
[SPEAKER_26]: All we use, we have a free dumpster.

2038
02:30:56,218 --> 02:30:58,620
[SPEAKER_26]: It's my property.

2039
02:30:58,640 --> 02:31:00,061
[SPEAKER_26]: It's $100 dumpster permit.

2040
02:31:01,322 --> 02:31:03,464
[SPEAKER_26]: The last three years, I think we've been doing pay this.

2041
02:31:04,609 --> 02:31:06,570
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, nobody help us small businesses.

2042
02:31:07,751 --> 02:31:08,251
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, I do.

2043
02:31:08,291 --> 02:31:09,752
[SPEAKER_26]: I work very hard with my wife.

2044
02:31:09,772 --> 02:31:10,852
[SPEAKER_26]: I appreciate the city.

2045
02:31:10,872 --> 02:31:11,933
[SPEAKER_26]: They give me opportunity.

2046
02:31:13,293 --> 02:31:16,515
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think a lot of people, they call me as soon as they see me.

2047
02:31:16,535 --> 02:31:18,116
[SPEAKER_26]: He says, we saw you in division.

2048
02:31:19,056 --> 02:31:21,998
[SPEAKER_26]: And he says, we never put you down because we love you.

2049
02:31:22,258 --> 02:31:23,959
[SPEAKER_26]: You do good business in Medford.

2050
02:31:24,399 --> 02:31:26,020
[SPEAKER_26]: I renovate twice my place.

2051
02:31:26,480 --> 02:31:27,521
[SPEAKER_26]: I spent about $140,000, renovate twice.

2052
02:31:32,138 --> 02:31:33,058
[SPEAKER_26]: Very clean place.

2053
02:31:33,478 --> 02:31:34,578
[SPEAKER_26]: I try the best I can.

2054
02:31:34,698 --> 02:31:35,839
[SPEAKER_26]: Price is reasonable.

2055
02:31:36,759 --> 02:31:38,259
[SPEAKER_26]: I got a $7.99 pizza.

2056
02:31:38,759 --> 02:31:41,520
[SPEAKER_26]: I try to people come in Monday, Tuesday.

2057
02:31:42,780 --> 02:31:43,480
[SPEAKER_26]: What else I can do?

2058
02:31:44,160 --> 02:31:46,501
[SPEAKER_26]: The cheese, we buy it 15, 20 years ago.

2059
02:31:47,121 --> 02:31:48,801
[SPEAKER_26]: Today, it's over $3.

2060
02:31:49,921 --> 02:31:50,841
[SPEAKER_26]: We try to survive.

2061
02:31:52,342 --> 02:31:53,962
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm 64 years old.

2062
02:31:55,942 --> 02:31:59,203
[SPEAKER_26]: And I come to Medford 38, 38 and a half.

2063
02:32:00,482 --> 02:32:07,347
[SPEAKER_26]: And I make it all the way to 64 and I, I respect, I appreciate the city.

2064
02:32:07,427 --> 02:32:15,513
[SPEAKER_26]: Give me opportunity and I do the best I can because I come from small villains from Greece and I know what's the dollar worth.

2065
02:32:17,655 --> 02:32:20,437
[SPEAKER_26]: I was walking without the shoes till six years old.

2066
02:32:23,599 --> 02:32:28,163
[SPEAKER_26]: So I'm afraid I don't sleep well the last couple of weeks.

2067
02:32:28,822 --> 02:32:30,963
[SPEAKER_26]: since I see this machine in front of my place.

2068
02:32:32,464 --> 02:32:42,950
[SPEAKER_26]: I understand the city, everything expands, they need the revenue, but something else you can be work out to bring the money, like I do the same.

2069
02:32:44,170 --> 02:32:46,091
[SPEAKER_26]: My son says, I need this kind of money.

2070
02:32:46,331 --> 02:32:51,754
[SPEAKER_26]: I says, cut something, we can get this paycheck, because business, it's a bad day is coming.

2071
02:32:54,055 --> 02:32:56,857
[SPEAKER_26]: Every day, we see, we order food,

2072
02:32:58,451 --> 02:32:59,572
[SPEAKER_26]: Chicken wings are going up $5.

2073
02:32:59,632 --> 02:33:01,433
[SPEAKER_26]: The cheese is going up.

2074
02:33:02,014 --> 02:33:02,894
[SPEAKER_26]: The steak is going up.

2075
02:33:03,075 --> 02:33:03,635
[SPEAKER_26]: Everything goes up.

2076
02:33:03,675 --> 02:33:04,936
[SPEAKER_26]: But we stayed two years.

2077
02:33:05,016 --> 02:33:06,017
[SPEAKER_26]: I have the same prices.

2078
02:33:07,698 --> 02:33:08,499
[SPEAKER_26]: That's all I want to say.

2079
02:33:09,179 --> 02:33:10,640
[SPEAKER_26]: And we can do something about it.

2080
02:33:10,720 --> 02:33:14,003
[SPEAKER_25]: I think it should be enforced parking, 15 minutes.

2081
02:33:14,643 --> 02:33:15,824
[SPEAKER_25]: No one really abuses it.

2082
02:33:16,285 --> 02:33:17,586
[SPEAKER_25]: They run in and they run out.

2083
02:33:17,966 --> 02:33:20,748
[SPEAKER_25]: But ever since the meter's been there, there's nobody coming.

2084
02:33:23,820 --> 02:33:42,489
[SPEAKER_14]: The chief has been taking notes, is aware of the situation, and I know that, as he said, as the program progresses, that whatever adjustments need to be made will be.

2085
02:33:44,850 --> 02:33:45,710
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

2086
02:33:46,050 --> 02:33:46,410
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2087
02:33:47,411 --> 02:33:47,851
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor.

2088
02:33:48,972 --> 02:33:49,932
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Longo, Kern.

2089
02:33:51,155 --> 02:33:56,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Just if we could get maybe an update from the mayor's office as well.

2090
02:33:56,299 --> 02:34:02,503
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this council did vote to, I believe it went to vote to allow for 15 minute free parking.

2091
02:34:03,044 --> 02:34:16,354
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if they've evaluated the contract versus how much the city's making versus what the 15 minutes would cost, I mean, I don't know if we'd break it down into districts, but I think it's worth pursuing.

2092
02:34:16,394 --> 02:34:20,617
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's obviously what some businesses need, free 15 minute parking.

2093
02:34:21,796 --> 02:34:24,438
[SPEAKER_03]: to allow their businesses to strive and survive.

2094
02:34:25,199 --> 02:34:32,945
[SPEAKER_03]: We did vote for that, and I think it's something that's worth the city taking a hit on our portion of the contract just to help our small businesses.

2095
02:34:33,005 --> 02:34:48,879
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we could get an update from the mayor's office, if they've looked into a free 15-minute parking, how much that would cost the city, how much that would cost Republic, and whether or not, you know, the administration's willing to take that hit and allow free 15-minute parking.

2096
02:34:49,674 --> 02:34:57,177
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's something that's going to come down the line and it needs to come sooner than later before, you know, we have hundreds of businesses here in trouble.

2097
02:34:57,737 --> 02:34:58,117
[SPEAKER_14]: It does.

2098
02:34:58,558 --> 02:35:06,341
[SPEAKER_14]: And so on the, on a item number 15 dash zero zero nine, uh, moved by a council, a longer current, the clerk has all that.

2099
02:35:06,861 --> 02:35:14,144
[SPEAKER_14]: So on that motion, uh, and, uh, before the next citizen speaks, if I could just briefly say from the chair that, uh,

2100
02:35:15,235 --> 02:35:18,377
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, no, I'll reserve that because I ought not to speak from the chair.

2101
02:35:18,397 --> 02:35:19,738
[SPEAKER_14]: Sir, your name and address for the record.

2102
02:35:20,459 --> 02:35:20,939
[SPEAKER_22]: Excuse me.

2103
02:35:21,099 --> 02:35:23,421
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm Jim Bilodeau of Gill Street, Medford.

2104
02:35:24,041 --> 02:35:27,743
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm just a typical customer of all the stores and all the squares.

2105
02:35:28,644 --> 02:35:33,107
[SPEAKER_22]: Stephens Square, I shop South Medford, West Medford, and of course, Medford Square.

2106
02:35:33,527 --> 02:35:40,211
[SPEAKER_22]: Now what the city is asking us customers to do is to park and pay while we go in and, you know, spend our money.

2107
02:35:40,631 --> 02:35:42,553
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'm going to have to inconvenience myself

2108
02:35:43,173 --> 02:35:49,156
[SPEAKER_22]: and walk to one of these machines in the opposite direction, most likely, from where I want to shop.

2109
02:35:49,536 --> 02:35:59,622
[SPEAKER_22]: I have to come back, go in the store, and if I did pay, which I have a security issue with, if I pay with a credit card or a debit card,

2110
02:36:00,082 --> 02:36:03,985
[SPEAKER_22]: and I put all my information in there with my plate number, how secure is that?

2111
02:36:04,206 --> 02:36:05,106
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm not gonna do that.

2112
02:36:05,707 --> 02:36:18,017
[SPEAKER_22]: And then I go in, I buy my stuff, and if I did do that, put my credit card and all my information into these machines, and I come out and I have a $25 ticket, if I don't come out in time, say I go in a restaurant.

2113
02:36:18,837 --> 02:36:34,764
[SPEAKER_22]: If I go in there and I have a cup of coffee and a donut, and I spend more than 15 to 20 minutes, and I come out and I have a $25 ticket, I'll guarantee you one thing, anybody who gets this $25 ticket the first time, they'll never shop in this square again, any of those squares.

2114
02:36:36,124 --> 02:36:41,947
[SPEAKER_22]: And also, if you put these machines in the Meadow Grand Mall, what do you think would happen to the Meadow Grand Mall?

2115
02:36:44,900 --> 02:36:48,402
[SPEAKER_22]: So I think it's a bad, bad program.

2116
02:36:48,822 --> 02:36:51,143
[SPEAKER_22]: And just ask, if you want to, ask Brookline.

2117
02:36:51,843 --> 02:36:53,084
[SPEAKER_22]: And Medford's not Brookline.

2118
02:36:53,884 --> 02:36:56,125
[SPEAKER_22]: And it failed in Brookline, everybody, you know that.

2119
02:36:56,745 --> 02:36:58,446
[SPEAKER_22]: Brookline, why did it fail in Brookline?

2120
02:36:58,726 --> 02:37:02,328
[SPEAKER_22]: Nobody wanted to pay, and all those reasons.

2121
02:37:02,448 --> 02:37:05,369
[SPEAKER_22]: And also, the stores all suffered, and a lot of them went out of business.

2122
02:37:05,809 --> 02:37:06,810
[SPEAKER_22]: And so they took it out.

2123
02:37:07,450 --> 02:37:08,631
[SPEAKER_22]: They had to buy their way out.

2124
02:37:08,871 --> 02:37:14,093
[SPEAKER_22]: You can buy your way out of Medford, just get Republic $800,000, and they'll take them right out for you.

2125
02:37:15,232 --> 02:37:17,653
[SPEAKER_22]: That's all I have to say, and thank you very much for hearing me.

2126
02:37:19,274 --> 02:37:19,654
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2127
02:37:23,616 --> 02:37:24,377
[SPEAKER_06]: Sir, thank you.

2128
02:37:24,437 --> 02:37:26,138
[SPEAKER_06]: Please state your name and address for the record.

2129
02:37:26,978 --> 02:37:28,059
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2130
02:37:28,159 --> 02:37:30,560
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Robert Cappucci of 71 Evans Street.

2131
02:37:30,600 --> 02:37:32,121
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll try to be very, very brief.

2132
02:37:33,542 --> 02:37:38,144
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, I mean, my heart's torn out listening to all these folks come up here.

2133
02:37:38,605 --> 02:37:39,485
[SPEAKER_06]: My heart is shattered.

2134
02:37:40,045 --> 02:37:42,126
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's not about critical emotion.

2135
02:37:42,166 --> 02:37:43,227
[SPEAKER_06]: It's about critical thinking.

2136
02:37:43,706 --> 02:37:47,967
[SPEAKER_06]: And unfortunately, this program is going to get worse before it gets better.

2137
02:37:48,447 --> 02:38:05,031
[SPEAKER_06]: The representatives of the mayor that come before us and say they can write down information and implement this, that, or the other thing, when I went to the town community meeting at the police station the other night, with all due respect to the chief, he said right out,

2138
02:38:05,512 --> 02:38:10,294
[SPEAKER_06]: that these interim prices are interim, and they're most likely going to go up.

2139
02:38:11,114 --> 02:38:14,396
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to get worse before it gets better.

2140
02:38:14,976 --> 02:38:19,878
[SPEAKER_06]: And unfortunately, I hate to say this, but the fact is the contract has been signed.

2141
02:38:20,658 --> 02:38:24,920
[SPEAKER_06]: This city is under a plan A strong mayor charter.

2142
02:38:25,400 --> 02:38:30,582
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why he can stay at home and send his representatives down here when he should be here.

2143
02:38:31,003 --> 02:38:34,464
[SPEAKER_06]: My suggestion, with all due respect to this city council,

2144
02:38:34,865 --> 02:38:41,007
[SPEAKER_06]: would be to pass a resolution to have the mayor come down and sit here and field questions on this matter.

2145
02:38:41,287 --> 02:38:42,487
[SPEAKER_06]: He signed this contract.

2146
02:38:42,727 --> 02:38:48,569
[SPEAKER_06]: It's up to him to come out from behind the shadows and stop sending folks down here to take the hits for him.

2147
02:38:48,929 --> 02:38:52,410
[SPEAKER_06]: My heart goes out to the chief having to take all these questions, too.

2148
02:38:53,850 --> 02:38:56,371
[SPEAKER_06]: It's unfortunate, and I'll just close with this.

2149
02:38:57,351 --> 02:39:04,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Through the chair to three city councilors up here, Councilors Marks, Penta, and Longo Kern,

2150
02:39:04,503 --> 02:39:11,525
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the issue where this city is ready to give you the broom, and we can call you either her or his honor, the mayor.

2151
02:39:11,806 --> 02:39:13,066
[SPEAKER_06]: Take up action, please.

2152
02:39:13,166 --> 02:39:13,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

2153
02:39:19,208 --> 02:39:19,668
[SPEAKER_28]: Good evening.

2154
02:39:19,768 --> 02:39:21,429
[SPEAKER_28]: Please state your name and address for the record.

2155
02:39:21,449 --> 02:39:26,391
[SPEAKER_28]: My name is Anthony D'Antonio of Yale Street, number 12 Yale Street.

2156
02:39:26,911 --> 02:39:31,733
[SPEAKER_28]: And I'm just another one of those irate citizens right about now, because I can't believe

2157
02:39:33,441 --> 02:39:35,983
[SPEAKER_28]: that this city has gone forward with this program.

2158
02:39:36,723 --> 02:39:37,464
[SPEAKER_28]: It's astounding.

2159
02:39:37,504 --> 02:39:38,645
[SPEAKER_28]: I mean, this is wrong.

2160
02:39:38,725 --> 02:39:40,106
[SPEAKER_28]: I said it last week, it's wrong.

2161
02:39:40,746 --> 02:39:51,614
[SPEAKER_28]: And I have to come up here, and if I have to come up every week on a different issue with this parking program, which is actually a revenue enforcement program, I will do it under a different subject, because something's got to be done.

2162
02:39:56,538 --> 02:40:00,161
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Penta referred to it as a revenue enforcement program.

2163
02:40:00,461 --> 02:40:01,682
[SPEAKER_18]: Can you just explain that one of years?

2164
02:40:04,238 --> 02:40:04,978
[SPEAKER_18]: You said revenue.

2165
02:40:05,138 --> 02:40:08,000
[SPEAKER_18]: He just called it a revenue enforcement program.

2166
02:40:08,120 --> 02:40:08,600
[SPEAKER_28]: What is that?

2167
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:16,823
[SPEAKER_28]: We're made to believe that all these years that we were able to park in the streets, that we were supposed to bow down and say, well, thank you for letting us park in your streets.

2168
02:40:17,344 --> 02:40:26,547
[SPEAKER_28]: Now, if you have to go with these kiosks, and I see dozens of people, elderly people, young people, still having difficulty with the kiosks.

2169
02:40:27,408 --> 02:40:27,728
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know.

2170
02:40:27,808 --> 02:40:29,309
[SPEAKER_28]: You said you saw people in Boston.

2171
02:40:29,329 --> 02:40:30,269
[SPEAKER_28]: I mean, that's fine.

2172
02:40:30,309 --> 02:40:32,750
[SPEAKER_28]: But I see people having great difficulty here.

2173
02:40:32,993 --> 02:40:34,535
[SPEAKER_28]: So the thing is you don't put the money in there.

2174
02:40:34,755 --> 02:40:36,537
[SPEAKER_28]: You get a ticket, you're forced to pay.

2175
02:40:36,717 --> 02:40:36,997
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay.

2176
02:40:37,258 --> 02:40:38,299
[SPEAKER_28]: It comes into the city.

2177
02:40:38,639 --> 02:40:40,561
[SPEAKER_28]: This is, this is not the right way to do it.

2178
02:40:40,662 --> 02:40:46,208
[SPEAKER_28]: I mean, citizens will put up with it for a period of time, but it's, I had a business.

2179
02:40:46,428 --> 02:40:47,349
[SPEAKER_28]: I had two businesses.

2180
02:40:48,710 --> 02:40:49,912
[SPEAKER_28]: The counselors have businesses.

2181
02:40:51,053 --> 02:40:54,557
[SPEAKER_28]: You, if you don't know how to run a business, what it takes to run a business,

2182
02:40:54,930 --> 02:40:57,431
[SPEAKER_28]: There's no compassion for the people out there.

2183
02:40:57,811 --> 02:41:02,534
[SPEAKER_28]: I mean, the Chamber of Commerce, you know, for this particular program should be called the Chamber of Horrors.

2184
02:41:02,574 --> 02:41:04,314
[SPEAKER_28]: I mean, what have they done to this city?

2185
02:41:04,895 --> 02:41:05,375
[SPEAKER_28]: I mean, really.

2186
02:41:05,735 --> 02:41:08,216
[SPEAKER_28]: And I feel bad that Chief Sacco has to come up here also.

2187
02:41:08,676 --> 02:41:11,638
[SPEAKER_28]: The mayor should be sitting right here and taking the heat for this program.

2188
02:41:12,258 --> 02:41:19,602
[SPEAKER_28]: And I want the citizens of Medford to know whose fathers, or who's with the mayor, and who's with the program, and what are you going to do for the citizens?

2189
02:41:19,662 --> 02:41:20,902
[SPEAKER_28]: Because it's wrong.

2190
02:41:21,042 --> 02:41:24,584
[SPEAKER_28]: I mean, Harvard Street and Main Street, it was crowded all the time.

2191
02:41:25,032 --> 02:41:26,172
[SPEAKER_28]: There was nobody up there today.

2192
02:41:26,712 --> 02:41:27,173
[SPEAKER_28]: They're gone.

2193
02:41:27,513 --> 02:41:31,734
[SPEAKER_28]: People are complaining about businesses, even the Oasis Restaurant, one of the busiest places around there.

2194
02:41:32,214 --> 02:41:35,535
[SPEAKER_28]: He's already dipped because they don't—these guys, they work hard.

2195
02:41:35,575 --> 02:41:37,355
[SPEAKER_28]: They don't want a $25 ticket.

2196
02:41:37,575 --> 02:41:38,315
[SPEAKER_28]: I mean, that's a lot of money.

2197
02:41:38,335 --> 02:41:39,676
[SPEAKER_28]: It's coming out of their pockets.

2198
02:41:39,716 --> 02:41:42,756
[SPEAKER_28]: It's coming out of the table, food, clothing for their children and their families.

2199
02:41:43,256 --> 02:41:44,697
[SPEAKER_28]: So it's got to be reviewed.

2200
02:41:44,757 --> 02:41:47,477
[SPEAKER_28]: It's got to be every week until something happens.

2201
02:41:47,517 --> 02:41:53,799
[SPEAKER_28]: I would think that I would like to see a hold put on to the start of this program because

2202
02:41:54,590 --> 02:41:59,692
[SPEAKER_28]: We're not ready for it, the citizens are not ready for it, and the businesses are already starting to pay the price.

2203
02:41:59,852 --> 02:42:00,212
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

2204
02:42:03,094 --> 02:42:05,875
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi.

2205
02:42:06,695 --> 02:42:08,916
[SPEAKER_14]: Come on up and please state your name and address for the record.

2206
02:42:09,216 --> 02:42:12,478
[SPEAKER_21]: Mary Ann Ashcraft, 77 Fountain Street.

2207
02:42:13,278 --> 02:42:17,019
[SPEAKER_21]: And I hate speaking in public.

2208
02:42:17,640 --> 02:42:17,840
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

2209
02:42:19,821 --> 02:42:22,902
[SPEAKER_21]: A very, very dear friend is sitting here who is a dentist.

2210
02:42:24,350 --> 02:42:26,531
[SPEAKER_21]: Sometimes you have three, four hour appointments.

2211
02:42:27,612 --> 02:42:28,492
[SPEAKER_21]: There's nowhere to park.

2212
02:42:29,813 --> 02:42:35,816
[SPEAKER_21]: And there's certainly you're not going to get out of your chair, out of the dental chair, and go pump a meter.

2213
02:42:36,817 --> 02:42:38,758
[SPEAKER_21]: I've lived in Medford my whole life.

2214
02:42:38,878 --> 02:42:39,618
[SPEAKER_21]: I was born here.

2215
02:42:41,059 --> 02:42:41,499
[SPEAKER_21]: You know what?

2216
02:42:41,639 --> 02:42:42,920
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm ready to exit Medford.

2217
02:42:43,160 --> 02:42:46,842
[SPEAKER_21]: I never thought those words would come out of my mouth.

2218
02:42:49,292 --> 02:42:54,855
[SPEAKER_21]: When I was born here, I left here for six months, many years ago, and I was right back.

2219
02:42:55,796 --> 02:42:57,677
[SPEAKER_21]: We had a parking lot.

2220
02:42:58,358 --> 02:42:59,198
[SPEAKER_21]: We had meters.

2221
02:43:00,059 --> 02:43:02,360
[SPEAKER_21]: Millions of dollars were spent on a ring road.

2222
02:43:03,801 --> 02:43:04,842
[SPEAKER_21]: We have less parking.

2223
02:43:06,122 --> 02:43:15,208
[SPEAKER_21]: This poor woman now is looking at maybe having an overpass over her parking lot with the new construction and the Craddock Bridge repairs.

2224
02:43:17,229 --> 02:43:18,410
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm in the square all the time.

2225
02:43:19,842 --> 02:43:22,203
[SPEAKER_21]: Probably after Thursday, I won't be in the square at all.

2226
02:43:23,583 --> 02:43:25,124
[SPEAKER_21]: This is my personal feeling.

2227
02:43:25,844 --> 02:43:28,445
[SPEAKER_21]: I see Rick in the bookstore.

2228
02:43:29,626 --> 02:43:31,226
[SPEAKER_21]: The Dillmans are going out of business.

2229
02:43:32,286 --> 02:43:33,267
[SPEAKER_21]: They can't stay there.

2230
02:43:34,627 --> 02:43:35,808
[SPEAKER_21]: The rent is being doubled.

2231
02:43:36,728 --> 02:43:37,528
[SPEAKER_21]: Bog knows them.

2232
02:43:38,949 --> 02:43:40,910
[SPEAKER_21]: Now the mayor comes to talk to the owner.

2233
02:43:42,350 --> 02:43:44,131
[SPEAKER_21]: The realtor comes to talk to the owner.

2234
02:43:45,151 --> 02:43:47,432
[SPEAKER_21]: Where were they when he was out of business for five years?

2235
02:43:48,152 --> 02:43:50,973
[SPEAKER_21]: because Casoli was renovating the building.

2236
02:43:51,753 --> 02:43:53,273
[SPEAKER_21]: Wards is going out of business.

2237
02:43:54,933 --> 02:44:06,236
[SPEAKER_21]: Methods changing, and not for the better, and making people pay to park, to see doctors, to sit and have a cup of coffee for an hour or two with friends, go to the diner.

2238
02:44:06,476 --> 02:44:07,636
[SPEAKER_21]: Bob, we see you there.

2239
02:44:08,616 --> 02:44:12,557
[SPEAKER_21]: This isn't going to happen anymore, and I feel like everybody else here.

2240
02:44:13,097 --> 02:44:15,718
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a travesty, and I'm brokenhearted.

2241
02:44:16,238 --> 02:44:16,598
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

2242
02:44:19,064 --> 02:44:23,106
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

2243
02:44:23,126 --> 02:44:28,649
[SPEAKER_14]: The motion before us is from Council Vice President Brianna Lungo-Kern.

2244
02:44:31,150 --> 02:44:31,830
[SPEAKER_14]: Move approval.

2245
02:44:32,110 --> 02:44:33,031
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favour?

2246
02:44:38,694 --> 02:44:41,055
[SPEAKER_14]: The clerk is going to read the motion.

2247
02:44:41,975 --> 02:44:42,896
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk, please.

2248
02:44:48,285 --> 02:44:51,027
[SPEAKER_15]: 15 minute, uh, free parking proposal that we submitted.

2249
02:44:51,207 --> 02:44:52,407
[SPEAKER_15]: And, uh, what would it cost?

2250
02:44:53,348 --> 02:44:58,911
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, and with the city entertained, uh, uh, this program.

2251
02:45:00,932 --> 02:45:02,452
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

2252
02:45:05,054 --> 02:45:06,654
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Penta motion.

2253
02:45:06,895 --> 02:45:08,936
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, tonight we've seen, uh, we started this meeting.

2254
02:45:08,956 --> 02:45:13,118
[SPEAKER_05]: The time is now it's approximately, uh, it's about 12 minutes to 10.

2255
02:45:13,498 --> 02:45:15,119
[SPEAKER_05]: We started at seven, probably around seven 30.

2256
02:45:15,159 --> 02:45:15,799
[SPEAKER_05]: This went on.

2257
02:45:17,062 --> 02:45:22,663
[SPEAKER_05]: We've seen a varied amount of people come before us of all ages and expressing what their concerns might be.

2258
02:45:23,083 --> 02:45:24,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Jimmy's Pizza, let's go with you.

2259
02:45:24,404 --> 02:45:25,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's start off with you, okay?

2260
02:45:26,024 --> 02:45:27,324
[SPEAKER_05]: You've been there a long period of time.

2261
02:45:27,404 --> 02:45:34,046
[SPEAKER_05]: You've worked yourself, however you worked yourself up to be a successful businessman, own the property, maintaining it.

2262
02:45:34,346 --> 02:45:43,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you're in a position that a stupid little meter, and I'll call it that, a stupid little kiosk in front of your store is going to stop people from coming in, going into your store,

2263
02:45:44,445 --> 02:45:45,967
[SPEAKER_05]: on all the other places that you have.

2264
02:45:46,808 --> 02:46:08,548
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reason why it's stupid because whoever thought by putting that kiosk there as a revenue enhancement for the city didn't realize it was going to be a business loss to the city because you and all your tenants are going to wind up losing customers and you're going to wind up going maybe in a bankruptcy and the city's going to wind up having another block that might become blighted because people are fickle.

2265
02:46:09,189 --> 02:46:17,872
[SPEAKER_05]: And when they're fickle over something like this, it isn't the quarter, it's the whole idea of I'm now having to pay for something that I never had to pay for before.

2266
02:46:18,552 --> 02:46:22,293
[SPEAKER_05]: When all this was supposed to be was revenue enforcement.

2267
02:46:22,333 --> 02:46:25,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Counselor Marks was on the committee, as so was the chief of police.

2268
02:46:26,194 --> 02:46:28,555
[SPEAKER_05]: It was submitted on September of 2009.

2269
02:46:28,795 --> 02:46:30,975
[SPEAKER_05]: They worked on it from 2008 to 2009.

2270
02:46:33,416 --> 02:46:36,417
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you read what the mayor said publicly, what did he turn around?

2271
02:46:36,597 --> 02:46:39,218
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been working on this for five years.

2272
02:46:39,978 --> 02:46:51,261
[SPEAKER_05]: If this is what he's been working on for five years, and this is the best he could come up with, with no ribbon-cutting ceremony because it's a quiet program, well, then shame on him.

2273
02:46:51,321 --> 02:46:54,042
[SPEAKER_05]: That corner office definitely needs to be replaced.

2274
02:46:54,482 --> 02:46:55,762
[SPEAKER_05]: It needs new leadership.

2275
02:46:55,782 --> 02:46:56,782
[SPEAKER_05]: It needs a new vision.

2276
02:46:57,042 --> 02:46:58,923
[SPEAKER_05]: It needs to have an idea to understand.

2277
02:46:59,743 --> 02:47:17,427
[SPEAKER_05]: that if I'm a businessman and I have to go to work in the morning, I have to know what it means to open the door, turn that key, and when I put that light on, I'm paying for electric, gas, workman's comp, workman's unemployment, sick, vacation, okay, and everything else that it takes to run a business.

2278
02:47:17,467 --> 02:47:19,528
[SPEAKER_05]: That guy in the corner office doesn't know what it means.

2279
02:47:20,028 --> 02:47:23,509
[SPEAKER_05]: He makes $142,000 off the taxpayers of this community.

2280
02:47:23,729 --> 02:47:29,130
[SPEAKER_05]: He has absolutely no idea what it means to make a business work and survive.

2281
02:47:29,850 --> 02:47:30,913
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is the problem.

2282
02:47:31,474 --> 02:47:39,413
[SPEAKER_05]: And the problem further is that he took five department heads, not one citizen, he took five department heads and came up with this program.

2283
02:47:40,021 --> 02:47:43,382
[SPEAKER_05]: And now it's being changed and being changed and being changed.

2284
02:47:43,742 --> 02:47:46,463
[SPEAKER_05]: And while it's being changed and changed, you know why it's being changed?

2285
02:47:46,763 --> 02:47:48,324
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the people are responding.

2286
02:47:48,544 --> 02:48:03,648
[SPEAKER_05]: And if they had an opportunity to have this introduced to themselves well in advance, well in advance, and each little square was addressed independently of each other, because each square is different from each other, then you'd be able to understand what the problems, what the concerns might be.

2287
02:48:04,049 --> 02:48:08,650
[SPEAKER_05]: And you, Mr. Chief, you probably wouldn't have to be here three weeks in a row, strike that two weeks in a row,

2288
02:48:08,930 --> 02:48:14,758
[SPEAKER_05]: to know they're going to make these changes because had the mayor done his dutiful duty, this would have all been addressed ahead of time.

2289
02:48:14,938 --> 02:48:16,720
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe just a few little nuances at the end.

2290
02:48:17,321 --> 02:48:22,648
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe, as Councilor Camuso alluded to, if you really wanted to get into this program and make it

2291
02:48:23,062 --> 02:48:24,383
[SPEAKER_05]: fair and equitable for everyone.

2292
02:48:24,603 --> 02:48:32,668
[SPEAKER_05]: You should have put a parking meter in front of every single spot that people can understand what a parking meter looks like, not a kiosk, and then everybody will be treated the same.

2293
02:48:33,088 --> 02:48:38,531
[SPEAKER_05]: But the reason why they took them out over 50 years ago, because it was hurting business and they weren't being enforced.

2294
02:48:38,911 --> 02:48:41,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you realize how great this city would be?

2295
02:48:42,513 --> 02:48:43,514
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the only city.

2296
02:48:43,754 --> 02:48:50,098
[SPEAKER_05]: You go to Winchester, who now is putting these crazy things in, you go to Somerville, you go to Malden, you go to Everett.

2297
02:48:50,378 --> 02:48:56,341
[SPEAKER_05]: If we were the only city come to Medford for free parking, do you know what that would do to the business community?

2298
02:48:56,741 --> 02:49:04,225
[SPEAKER_05]: All the chief would have to do with his police officers, and I say that with all due respect, because there's money in the budget that the mayor won't give them.

2299
02:49:04,646 --> 02:49:09,888
[SPEAKER_05]: This council has been supportive of this police department each and every budget and each and every year that I've been here.

2300
02:49:10,349 --> 02:49:16,752
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you had that, all you'd have to turn around, you would have time constraints in each one of the sections of the city, and you'd see the turnover take place.

2301
02:49:16,912 --> 02:49:17,512
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know something?

2302
02:49:17,572 --> 02:49:18,573
[SPEAKER_05]: And the people would appreciate it.

2303
02:49:19,614 --> 02:49:21,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Why all of a sudden we changing from two hours to three hours?

2304
02:49:22,175 --> 02:49:23,195
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the people complain.

2305
02:49:24,076 --> 02:49:28,217
[SPEAKER_05]: The young lady that just came up here who said she doesn't come on, she's not going to come on Thursdays anymore.

2306
02:49:28,478 --> 02:49:29,658
[SPEAKER_05]: She might be in a dentist's office.

2307
02:49:30,258 --> 02:49:30,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Quite true.

2308
02:49:30,718 --> 02:49:32,979
[SPEAKER_05]: She could be in a dentist's office, could be in a doctor's office.

2309
02:49:33,159 --> 02:49:34,160
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't know what's going to happen.

2310
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:46,845
[SPEAKER_05]: It took a hairdresser, because of her relationship to the city hall here, to scream loud enough, because she didn't want her business hurt, that it introduced itself to all the other type of hairdressers and businesses in the community.

2311
02:49:47,275 --> 02:49:51,037
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the reasons why it's bumped up to three hours.

2312
02:49:51,678 --> 02:49:58,902
[SPEAKER_05]: You go up Governor's Avenue, biggest abuse in the city, go up Governor's Avenue, on the right-hand side it's two hours, on the left-hand side coming down it's one hour.

2313
02:49:59,222 --> 02:50:01,664
[SPEAKER_05]: Where the logic to that came from, I have absolutely no idea.

2314
02:50:02,705 --> 02:50:06,607
[SPEAKER_05]: But I really think we can have resolution after resolution after resolution.

2315
02:50:06,647 --> 02:50:11,250
[SPEAKER_05]: The only way this thing is going to be resolved is that guy in the corner office is going to have to come here.

2316
02:50:11,623 --> 02:50:12,163
[SPEAKER_05]: and squash it.

2317
02:50:12,224 --> 02:50:14,545
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's Mr... You live on Gill Street?

2318
02:50:14,565 --> 02:50:15,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that what you said you do?

2319
02:50:15,806 --> 02:50:17,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the gentleman from Gill Street.

2320
02:50:17,408 --> 02:50:17,888
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe it's $900,000.

2321
02:50:18,068 --> 02:50:20,870
[SPEAKER_05]: You can buy yourself out of the contract.

2322
02:50:20,890 --> 02:50:23,092
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe your boss was here two weeks ago.

2323
02:50:23,132 --> 02:50:24,113
[SPEAKER_05]: He came before the podium.

2324
02:50:24,393 --> 02:50:27,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Within the first year, if it doesn't work out, there's an opt-out provision.

2325
02:50:27,115 --> 02:50:35,182
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd rather spend a million dollars now to get rid of them because the damage that this is going to do in the long run will be worse than anything that's ever happened.

2326
02:50:39,532 --> 02:50:44,954
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm supporting, I'll support anything this council has to do with making this thing be better.

2327
02:50:45,574 --> 02:50:47,415
[SPEAKER_05]: But all we're doing is talking.

2328
02:50:47,475 --> 02:50:48,575
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the guy in the corner office.

2329
02:50:48,595 --> 02:50:50,076
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got to inundate that office.

2330
02:50:50,296 --> 02:50:52,417
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got to tell him we don't want it.

2331
02:50:52,837 --> 02:50:53,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Get it out of here.

2332
02:50:53,717 --> 02:50:54,977
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's kind of like interesting.

2333
02:50:56,038 --> 02:50:58,879
[SPEAKER_05]: Whether they read a report, the Walker report, is that what you call it?

2334
02:50:58,919 --> 02:50:59,639
[SPEAKER_05]: The Walker report?

2335
02:50:59,859 --> 02:51:04,300
[SPEAKER_05]: The Walker report that this company, Republic from Tennessee, went by, I think it's 900 or 890 spots.

2336
02:51:06,852 --> 02:51:11,235
[SPEAKER_05]: But you had three months to locate the spots and to see if these spots were going to make any sense.

2337
02:51:11,735 --> 02:51:14,076
[SPEAKER_05]: Why are we talking about this after the fact?

2338
02:51:14,757 --> 02:51:16,758
[SPEAKER_05]: This is symptomatic of leadership that doesn't work.

2339
02:51:17,138 --> 02:51:18,779
[SPEAKER_05]: There is no leadership in the city right now.

2340
02:51:19,059 --> 02:51:20,000
[SPEAKER_05]: It's reactionary.

2341
02:51:20,881 --> 02:51:33,388
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, three hours in the parking lot, if you go outside here, that side over there on the name of the street, I don't know, there's one little kiosk in between the city's building and the parking lot over here for which half of the parking lot is private.

2342
02:51:34,009 --> 02:51:36,330
[SPEAKER_05]: So who's going to make that determination when they pull in there?

2343
02:51:36,670 --> 02:51:39,491
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it was you, Councilman Oxford, you said it originally in the beginning.

2344
02:51:40,071 --> 02:51:42,812
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody knows where the beginning and the end of it ends when you see a kiosk.

2345
02:51:43,232 --> 02:51:46,433
[SPEAKER_05]: A lady called me up this afternoon and she indicated, I have no idea where I'm supposed to go.

2346
02:51:47,073 --> 02:51:48,734
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, am I going five spots, four spots?

2347
02:51:49,114 --> 02:51:51,755
[SPEAKER_05]: And if it's a big, long stretch, what are you supposed to do?

2348
02:51:51,815 --> 02:51:52,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's supposed to know that?

2349
02:51:53,115 --> 02:51:53,695
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know that.

2350
02:51:53,755 --> 02:51:54,556
[SPEAKER_05]: None of us know that.

2351
02:51:55,656 --> 02:52:01,658
[SPEAKER_05]: And to get the ticket, and there's the other lady, I don't know if she's still here or if she's gone, that talked about if she's five, maybe the first hour should be free.

2352
02:52:02,070 --> 02:52:07,131
[SPEAKER_05]: And what I don't understand, and I know you're here, Mr. Nash, and you're a good guy because you're from Republican.

2353
02:52:07,151 --> 02:52:10,032
[SPEAKER_05]: We've had our conversations, but you're here to make money, and I understand that.

2354
02:52:10,892 --> 02:52:14,533
[SPEAKER_05]: But we were told it was going to start off with two cars that are going to monitor the city.

2355
02:52:15,314 --> 02:52:16,214
[SPEAKER_05]: So the question is this.

2356
02:52:16,874 --> 02:52:17,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you come up here, please?

2357
02:52:22,636 --> 02:52:26,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it still going to be two cars that are going to monitor this whole city with all these issues?

2358
02:52:26,917 --> 02:52:27,077
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

2359
02:52:27,737 --> 02:52:30,538
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're telling me in the course of a two-hour span,

2360
02:52:31,963 --> 02:52:41,067
[SPEAKER_05]: All these concerns and all these little exceptions to the rule, you'll be able to go from A to B, you're both cars, and address every single one of the locations in this city.

2361
02:52:41,087 --> 02:52:44,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that what we're saying?

2362
02:52:44,809 --> 02:52:44,849
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

2363
02:52:44,869 --> 02:52:44,909
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.

2364
02:52:44,929 --> 02:52:47,090
[SPEAKER_18]: We can't monitor the entire city every two hours.

2365
02:52:47,310 --> 02:52:49,311
[SPEAKER_18]: Point of information, Councillor Camuso.

2366
02:52:50,171 --> 02:52:52,792
[SPEAKER_18]: Contractual question for you, following up on Councillor Penta.

2367
02:52:54,033 --> 02:52:55,914
[SPEAKER_18]: Limited to two in the contract?

2368
02:52:57,414 --> 02:52:57,614
[SPEAKER_18]: No.

2369
02:52:57,854 --> 02:53:01,016
[SPEAKER_08]: What's the contract state in that particular motion?

2370
02:53:01,672 --> 02:53:07,038
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the contract states a certain number of hours that we should do to provide enforcement.

2371
02:53:07,579 --> 02:53:11,423
[SPEAKER_18]: But who makes the determination whether it's two hours a week?

2372
02:53:12,104 --> 02:53:12,725
[SPEAKER_18]: No, no.

2373
02:53:12,865 --> 02:53:13,345
[SPEAKER_18]: How many hours?

2374
02:53:13,365 --> 02:53:13,345
92.

2375
02:53:14,827 --> 02:53:15,348
[SPEAKER_18]: 92 hours a week.

2376
02:53:15,448 --> 02:53:15,628
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.

2377
02:53:15,788 --> 02:53:18,231
[SPEAKER_18]: But there's the ability to expand that if the needs be.

2378
02:53:19,124 --> 02:53:21,445
[SPEAKER_08]: You are at mutual.

2379
02:53:21,606 --> 02:53:25,808
[SPEAKER_08]: We're discussing with the city and say, you know, present time.

2380
02:53:26,409 --> 02:53:31,672
[SPEAKER_18]: The reason I, the reason I asked that if your revenues aren't what you like, now you put out 25 people doing tickets.

2381
02:53:32,012 --> 02:53:33,353
[SPEAKER_18]: No, we don't have the ability.

2382
02:53:33,373 --> 02:53:44,960
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to make sure you don't have the authority to, uh, you can't say, uh, you know what is hopefully people just play by the rules and you guys go bankrupt.

2383
02:53:44,980 --> 02:53:45,580
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what I'm hoping.

2384
02:53:46,281 --> 02:53:46,401
[SPEAKER_18]: But,

2385
02:53:47,947 --> 02:53:52,069
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, yeah, no, I just want to make sure that, uh, and, and that would be our lawyer.

2386
02:53:52,089 --> 02:53:56,850
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd like to ask the question, what the max is to our legal department, because I don't want to see next week.

2387
02:53:57,531 --> 02:53:57,771
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

2388
02:53:57,791 --> 02:54:01,752
[SPEAKER_18]: We're now buying an extra seven vehicles and there's going to be nine cars out there now, ticket and everything.

2389
02:54:02,132 --> 02:54:04,373
[SPEAKER_18]: At least right now with two cars, it's a gamble.

2390
02:54:04,593 --> 02:54:04,853
[SPEAKER_18]: No, no, no.

2391
02:54:05,273 --> 02:54:06,114
[SPEAKER_18]: Right now it's a gamble.

2392
02:54:06,694 --> 02:54:12,896
[SPEAKER_18]: If the car's in Haines square, you might get away with it 20 times in West Medford, but that one time that the car's down in West Medford, you're getting a ticket.

2393
02:54:13,036 --> 02:54:13,917
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's not a guarantee.

2394
02:54:13,957 --> 02:54:17,638
[SPEAKER_18]: Every time you're taking a gamble, just like when you go to Winchester center, it's a gamble right now.

2395
02:54:17,992 --> 02:54:19,213
[SPEAKER_18]: You go to Davis Square, it's a gamble.

2396
02:54:19,733 --> 02:54:24,436
[SPEAKER_18]: But with that being said, the more people you put on the road, your odds are getting better that you're going to get a ticket.

2397
02:54:24,757 --> 02:54:30,100
[SPEAKER_18]: And I want to make sure that this isn't revenue-driven, the decision to put more cars on the road to ticket more people.

2398
02:54:30,821 --> 02:54:32,662
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'd like to ask that through our legal department.

2399
02:54:32,682 --> 02:54:33,743
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that's very important.

2400
02:54:34,703 --> 02:54:46,151
[SPEAKER_14]: So amended by Councilor Camuso on item number 15-009, that the city clerk, the city solicitor report back to the council

2401
02:54:46,688 --> 02:54:54,432
[SPEAKER_14]: regarding the limitation or the expense of the number of enforcement officers.

2402
02:54:55,392 --> 02:54:55,953
[SPEAKER_14]: No, cars.

2403
02:54:56,533 --> 02:54:57,173
[SPEAKER_14]: Or cars.

2404
02:54:57,233 --> 02:55:03,156
[SPEAKER_18]: No, officers, because listen, if they want to make revenue, they may just take a 15-passenger van and start dropping these ambassadors in all the squares.

2405
02:55:03,176 --> 02:55:06,338
[SPEAKER_14]: Cars and officers within the contract to exact the- Like Boston.

2406
02:55:06,358 --> 02:55:08,619
[SPEAKER_18]: You ever see the Boston Transportation Department?

2407
02:55:08,639 --> 02:55:10,240
[SPEAKER_18]: They show up with a little orange light on the roof.

2408
02:55:10,700 --> 02:55:13,501
[SPEAKER_18]: Next thing you know, there's 15 people jumping out with their little handheld things.

2409
02:55:13,521 --> 02:55:14,962
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's not what this is about.

2410
02:55:16,773 --> 02:55:17,433
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm concerned.

2411
02:55:17,993 --> 02:55:18,754
[SPEAKER_18]: Let me ask you a question.

2412
02:55:18,814 --> 02:55:19,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Camuso.

2413
02:55:19,894 --> 02:55:20,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2414
02:55:20,854 --> 02:55:21,675
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Penta.

2415
02:55:21,975 --> 02:55:23,135
[SPEAKER_05]: I just, you just said something.

2416
02:55:23,475 --> 02:55:28,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it possible that you guys could get a van and put five or 10 people in it and just drop them all around neighborhoods?

2417
02:55:30,637 --> 02:55:32,838
[SPEAKER_08]: Could we do enforcement on foot?

2418
02:55:33,218 --> 02:55:34,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, more than two people.

2419
02:55:34,079 --> 02:55:36,319
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we could.

2420
02:55:36,359 --> 02:55:38,380
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we'd have to get approval from

2421
02:55:39,883 --> 02:55:41,103
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to get approval.

2422
02:55:41,503 --> 02:55:42,844
[SPEAKER_08]: I couldn't make that decision on my own.

2423
02:55:43,044 --> 02:55:43,884
[SPEAKER_05]: Who makes that decision?

2424
02:55:44,804 --> 02:55:51,225
[SPEAKER_08]: We consult with the administration and say this is what we're seeing and we think there needs to be more enforcement in the residential area and then they would.

2425
02:55:51,305 --> 02:56:07,528
[SPEAKER_05]: So the only reason that you'd be doing that for a follow-up and what Councilor Camuso was saying is if your revenue is off and the revenue is going to be off because you don't have enough people on the street, you'd be going to the mayor and asking him for that permission and the mayor would be agreeing with you to meet your goal to get to that revenue number that you need to make.

2426
02:56:08,363 --> 02:56:09,543
[SPEAKER_08]: No, that wouldn't be the only reason.

2427
02:56:09,763 --> 02:56:11,644
[SPEAKER_18]: Point of information, Councillor Camuso.

2428
02:56:11,804 --> 02:56:18,606
[SPEAKER_18]: If, if indeed the mayor, and I have to say up to this point, we have no reason to believe that this is a revenue enhancement.

2429
02:56:18,626 --> 02:56:23,107
[SPEAKER_18]: We haven't seen it yet, but listen, the mayor is hearing this loud and clear as much as we do.

2430
02:56:23,488 --> 02:56:28,769
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sure he doesn't want, he'd rather not have any revenue and have no one getting tickets in his phone, not ringing.

2431
02:56:29,589 --> 02:56:31,690
[SPEAKER_18]: So as far as that said, I'd like to make a motion.

2432
02:56:32,123 --> 02:56:35,226
[SPEAKER_18]: that the mayor limits this to two, at least for the first year.

2433
02:56:35,506 --> 02:56:44,673
[SPEAKER_18]: They don't even negotiate to put more people on the road until an amendment to the contract or whatever it is until at least a year.

2434
02:56:44,933 --> 02:56:47,495
[SPEAKER_14]: So is that an additional amendment, Councilor Camuso?

2435
02:56:47,836 --> 02:56:48,076
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2436
02:56:48,136 --> 02:56:51,419
[SPEAKER_14]: That the mayor set a, that on the same

2437
02:56:52,673 --> 02:57:07,287
[SPEAKER_14]: A motion offered by Councilor Penta, amended by Councilor Camuso, that the mayor establish a limit of two enforcement modalities during the given shift.

2438
02:57:08,067 --> 02:57:10,169
[SPEAKER_18]: And here's the other one other thing to follow up on that.

2439
02:57:11,190 --> 02:57:13,172
[SPEAKER_18]: The chief of police still has the authority.

2440
02:57:14,406 --> 02:57:17,629
[SPEAKER_18]: The chief of police still has the authority to give out tickets, as we all know.

2441
02:57:18,549 --> 02:57:27,677
[SPEAKER_18]: In the off hours, I would rather see police officers given the opportunity to come in on overtime if they decide that they're going to whatever, because it's going to pay for itself.

2442
02:57:28,137 --> 02:57:34,703
[SPEAKER_18]: And my rationale with that is it puts an additional police officer on the road that can respond to a baby choking, can respond to a bank robbery, can respond to things.

2443
02:57:35,703 --> 02:57:41,708
[SPEAKER_18]: A meter ambassador isn't going to be able to respond to 911 calls and things of that nature if there's a serious emergency in the city.

2444
02:57:42,349 --> 02:57:43,470
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's going to pay for itself.

2445
02:57:44,436 --> 02:57:54,704
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think that that's important too, that the city looks at its own police force to do this on an overtime basis in regards to additional enforcement.

2446
02:57:55,024 --> 02:58:10,657
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I'm a firm believer, and I think all this council is, I can't speak for all the council, but I'm a firm believer, the more police officers we have on the street, whether it's a detail, whether it's overtime, whether it's parking enforcement, the city's in better hands because they got their radio on and they can respond to emergency needs as see fit.

2447
02:58:11,778 --> 02:58:12,979
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'd like to make that amendment too.

2448
02:58:15,578 --> 02:58:17,139
[SPEAKER_05]: And one other thing, legally.

2449
02:58:17,800 --> 02:58:31,009
[SPEAKER_05]: You made a comment, and I don't know if you meant to say it or not, but when the question was asked about the appeal process, and I don't know what councilor asked the question, you know, if there got to be too many, you indicated, used the term, well, at that point in time, we'd probably jump in to help out.

2450
02:58:31,369 --> 02:58:36,533
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think you can, because there is a legal contract here that's going on, and I think that's another thing.

2451
02:58:36,853 --> 02:58:43,878
[SPEAKER_05]: And when we get to these things that are being negotiated after the fact, and the council's not being apprised of it, I think we've got some serious problems here.

2452
02:58:44,538 --> 02:58:48,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the fact of the matter is, we've got two contracts, one month apart from each other, 9, 10, 14, 10, 10, 14.

2453
02:58:51,659 --> 02:58:54,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Only one word, two words would change in the whole contract.

2454
02:58:54,500 --> 02:58:58,601
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's very explicit as to what you guys can and cannot do.

2455
02:58:59,481 --> 02:59:07,122
[SPEAKER_05]: And for them to come out with a post-press release and turn around and saying that the first year of the $300,000 we're going to get, you're going to give $250,000.

2456
02:59:07,502 --> 02:59:08,862
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to go back to the business districts.

2457
02:59:11,991 --> 02:59:13,131
[SPEAKER_05]: That was never negotiated.

2458
02:59:13,171 --> 02:59:14,212
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not part of the contract.

2459
02:59:14,232 --> 02:59:15,092
[SPEAKER_05]: That's after the fact.

2460
02:59:15,532 --> 02:59:23,974
[SPEAKER_05]: So you've got a whole host of issues here that are just running amok because it just wasn't — this was not vetted out properly, as far as I'm concerned.

2461
02:59:24,914 --> 02:59:25,594
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you're here.

2462
02:59:26,274 --> 02:59:28,295
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to do a job because this is what your job is.

2463
02:59:28,515 --> 02:59:29,435
[SPEAKER_05]: But I've got a job, too.

2464
02:59:29,915 --> 02:59:32,556
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've got to make sure I'm listening to the people.

2465
02:59:32,596 --> 02:59:34,176
[SPEAKER_05]: And I haven't found — there's only one person.

2466
02:59:34,456 --> 02:59:36,737
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm up to — I got to apologize.

2467
02:59:36,777 --> 02:59:37,577
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm off by a few.

2468
02:59:37,897 --> 02:59:39,218
[SPEAKER_05]: I gave a different number on Sunday.

2469
02:59:39,278 --> 02:59:39,378
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 376.

2470
02:59:40,992 --> 02:59:42,933
[SPEAKER_05]: As of tonight, 376 emails.

2471
02:59:43,394 --> 02:59:47,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Only one person in the email said, I can't tell you whether it's bad or good.

2472
02:59:47,816 --> 02:59:48,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we should give it a chance.

2473
02:59:49,017 --> 02:59:53,360
[SPEAKER_05]: But probably, if you give it a chance, and the way the temperament is running, it probably won't work anyway.

2474
02:59:53,420 --> 02:59:54,321
[SPEAKER_05]: But what the hell?

2475
02:59:54,881 --> 02:59:55,621
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the only one.

2476
02:59:55,681 --> 02:59:57,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone else has been against it.

2477
02:59:57,703 --> 02:59:59,364
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know what the major reason is?

2478
03:00:00,404 --> 03:00:01,585
[SPEAKER_05]: A, they weren't advised.

2479
03:00:01,945 --> 03:00:06,448
[SPEAKER_05]: B, business districts did not meet between and amongst themselves to discuss it.

2480
03:00:06,929 --> 03:00:09,010
[SPEAKER_05]: And C, it seems kind of odd.

2481
03:00:09,501 --> 03:00:13,003
[SPEAKER_05]: that the city council is discussing this after the fact, not before the fact.

2482
03:00:20,387 --> 03:00:22,368
[SPEAKER_09]: Just one, one issue with the staffing.

2483
03:00:22,388 --> 03:00:35,335
[SPEAKER_09]: There's already been discussion with the permit parking, residential permit parking, that Republic may stagger some of their shifts to cover it, to help us on the evenings and the early part of the overnights if need be.

2484
03:00:35,840 --> 03:00:43,648
[SPEAKER_09]: because one thing we don't want to have happen is have permit parking in place and go back to the old days that maybe it's only done during the daytime.

2485
03:00:44,228 --> 03:00:58,903
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'd be, you just caution that as far as you know, how many people, I don't think you'll ever see them throw 25 people into the city to do something, but we do need some assistance at night information, information, constant point of clarification, chief.

2486
03:00:59,313 --> 03:01:00,975
[SPEAKER_18]: Point of clarification, Councilor Camuso.

2487
03:01:01,315 --> 03:01:02,516
[SPEAKER_18]: Is this staggering?

2488
03:01:02,537 --> 03:01:03,618
[SPEAKER_18]: You used the word staggering.

2489
03:01:04,178 --> 03:01:14,149
[SPEAKER_18]: So does that mean the person that will be out there driving around in this vehicle, one of them will come in, say, four in the afternoon, so in the morning will be down to one vehicle, or will it be two and then an additional person at night?

2490
03:01:14,830 --> 03:01:16,151
[SPEAKER_18]: The word staggering to me is...

2491
03:01:17,193 --> 03:01:23,496
[SPEAKER_09]: The way I understood it was that maybe some hours would be changed around so that they could have some coverage in those other hours.

2492
03:01:23,716 --> 03:01:31,039
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, we get a lot of phone calls in the early evening up to 10 o'clock at night about permit packing violations.

2493
03:01:32,100 --> 03:01:42,044
[SPEAKER_09]: Until the police department has the same technology which we're about to receive as far as being able to read the license plates that are actually registered for the permit packing program.

2494
03:01:42,843 --> 03:01:45,804
[SPEAKER_09]: we're going to have to rely on public to assist us with that.

2495
03:01:46,284 --> 03:01:59,227
[SPEAKER_18]: Should we, um, would it be in the best interest of the city to outfit one of our police cruises or maybe small smart car or something, something environmentally friendly that has the same thing, but it's actually a patrol vehicle police.

2496
03:01:59,547 --> 03:02:04,449
[SPEAKER_09]: We're looking to obtain maybe two units so that we can have a east and west coverage.

2497
03:02:04,829 --> 03:02:08,370
[SPEAKER_18]: I think then, and like I said, even if it's on an overtime basis, it's going to pay for itself.

2498
03:02:09,330 --> 03:02:09,430
[SPEAKER_18]: And,

2499
03:02:09,988 --> 03:02:16,053
[SPEAKER_18]: The police officers, I would rather see, because they're going to use their discretion a lot more than a private company, with all due respect.

2500
03:02:16,133 --> 03:02:18,154
[SPEAKER_18]: Private company, there's a violation.

2501
03:02:18,174 --> 03:02:18,815
[SPEAKER_09]: You're getting a ticket.

2502
03:02:18,955 --> 03:02:19,716
[SPEAKER_18]: The police officer.

2503
03:02:19,796 --> 03:02:21,677
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, the permit packing is what I'm looking at.

2504
03:02:21,737 --> 03:02:22,398
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, the permit packing.

2505
03:02:22,458 --> 03:02:24,900
[SPEAKER_18]: So the permit packing, either you're registered or you're not.

2506
03:02:24,920 --> 03:02:30,364
[SPEAKER_18]: The police officer running out of Sunnyhurst in Haines Square or the convenience store may give you a break.

2507
03:02:31,365 --> 03:02:31,885
[SPEAKER_18]: With all due respect.

2508
03:02:31,905 --> 03:02:32,526
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Counselor.

2509
03:02:32,946 --> 03:02:33,586
[SPEAKER_14]: Counselor Knight.

2510
03:02:34,827 --> 03:02:35,168
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

2511
03:02:35,388 --> 03:02:38,030
[SPEAKER_11]: Chief, there's a revenue sharing

2512
03:02:38,469 --> 03:02:44,890
[SPEAKER_11]: agreement on all tickets that are issued by the enforcement ambassadors?

2513
03:02:45,911 --> 03:02:50,512
[SPEAKER_11]: Enforcement ambassadors, and there's a revenue sharing component to that, correct?

2514
03:02:51,072 --> 03:02:54,733
[SPEAKER_11]: Where- There is, but I'm not totally familiar with the dollar amounts and any of that.

2515
03:02:54,793 --> 03:03:02,214
[SPEAKER_11]: Adversely, the Manfred Police Department still does maintain the right to enforce parking restrictions in place.

2516
03:03:02,594 --> 03:03:04,955
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a reciprocal revenue share?

2517
03:03:06,147 --> 03:03:07,628
[SPEAKER_09]: It all goes to the general amount.

2518
03:03:07,948 --> 03:03:09,309
[SPEAKER_09]: So it will all be processed.

2519
03:03:09,349 --> 03:03:10,890
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll write the handwritten tickets.

2520
03:03:11,611 --> 03:03:13,432
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be turned over to Republic.

2521
03:03:13,772 --> 03:03:16,694
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to take the data from that, put it into their system.

2522
03:03:17,215 --> 03:03:18,776
[SPEAKER_09]: So it all goes to the same place.

2523
03:03:19,897 --> 03:03:20,097
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2524
03:03:20,897 --> 03:03:22,579
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, uh, counselor Knight.

2525
03:03:23,059 --> 03:03:25,000
[SPEAKER_14]: It's good citizen has been waiting to speak.

2526
03:03:25,020 --> 03:03:29,744
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you don't want the citizen to speak?

2527
03:03:34,982 --> 03:03:40,847
[SPEAKER_05]: What incentive is there for a Metric police officer to write a ticket knowing that the money isn't even going to come back to the city?

2528
03:03:41,107 --> 03:03:42,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it has to go to Republic first.

2529
03:03:43,308 --> 03:03:46,551
[SPEAKER_05]: They've got to get to a certain dollar amount before the city even gets any money.

2530
03:03:47,412 --> 03:03:48,993
[SPEAKER_09]: We never look at that part.

2531
03:03:49,033 --> 03:03:51,515
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's about the violation.

2532
03:03:51,575 --> 03:03:52,776
[SPEAKER_09]: It's writing the violation.

2533
03:03:52,996 --> 03:03:54,197
[SPEAKER_09]: Wherever it goes, it goes.

2534
03:03:54,257 --> 03:03:56,538
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's like anything that we've done in the police department.

2535
03:03:56,558 --> 03:03:59,461
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever fees we generate goes into the general fund.

2536
03:03:59,541 --> 03:04:02,563
[SPEAKER_09]: And at budget time, we hope to get our piece of the pie.

2537
03:04:02,993 --> 03:04:09,975
[SPEAKER_05]: So if Republic only is going to have two cars on the road during the course of a day, correct?

2538
03:04:10,015 --> 03:04:10,996
[SPEAKER_05]: You're only going to have these two.

2539
03:04:11,456 --> 03:04:12,916
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm quite sure they have to take coffee breaks.

2540
03:04:12,936 --> 03:04:14,737
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to have to take their lunch break.

2541
03:04:15,257 --> 03:04:17,438
[SPEAKER_05]: So at some point in time, there may be only one car on the road.

2542
03:04:17,718 --> 03:04:21,539
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess the message that's being sent is that this is not going to be summable.

2543
03:04:21,679 --> 03:04:24,680
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not going to be jumping out of trees and things like that.

2544
03:04:24,880 --> 03:04:25,080
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2545
03:04:25,560 --> 03:04:28,361
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, if they only have two on the road, you can only cover so much ground.

2546
03:04:28,461 --> 03:04:30,882
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you going to be able to run in and grab a paper or grab a coffee?

2547
03:04:31,266 --> 03:04:32,026
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a good chance.

2548
03:04:32,126 --> 03:04:33,867
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's going to be a risk, but it's a good chance.

2549
03:04:35,187 --> 03:04:35,887
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, chief.

2550
03:04:36,027 --> 03:04:36,487
[SPEAKER_09]: And thank you.

2551
03:04:36,527 --> 03:04:37,948
[SPEAKER_12]: Counselor Penta, sir.

2552
03:04:40,668 --> 03:04:41,929
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, my name is James Bruno.

2553
03:04:41,969 --> 03:04:44,089
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm the owner of Meffitt auto school in Meffitt square.

2554
03:04:45,230 --> 03:04:48,130
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, just to let you know, just two points of observation.

2555
03:04:48,290 --> 03:04:49,591
[SPEAKER_12]: You could take it for good or bad.

2556
03:04:49,611 --> 03:04:54,492
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, I drive around all day, obviously with students and I go through all these major squares.

2557
03:04:55,272 --> 03:05:02,937
[SPEAKER_12]: And ever since this started, I noticed a lot of empty spots in front of these businesses on Boston Ave and High Street.

2558
03:05:02,957 --> 03:05:03,657
[SPEAKER_12]: They're all open.

2559
03:05:05,859 --> 03:05:08,380
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I mean, apparently the people ain't going into the business.

2560
03:05:09,401 --> 03:05:15,165
[SPEAKER_12]: The other point of interest is that sometimes I use Dunkin' Donuts or whatever to use the restroom.

2561
03:05:15,185 --> 03:05:18,547
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, I'm on the road all day, so I have to stop someplace.

2562
03:05:18,907 --> 03:05:21,869
[SPEAKER_12]: I gotta be honest with you, I'm afraid to pull over in front of Dunkin' Donuts.

2563
03:05:22,471 --> 03:05:25,073
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, Councilor Marks knows I use, excuse me, Dunkin' Donuts.

2564
03:05:25,353 --> 03:05:29,076
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm afraid to pull over sometimes just to run in to use the bathroom.

2565
03:05:29,516 --> 03:05:32,419
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I had to find a Dunkin' Donuts that has a back parking lot or something.

2566
03:05:33,319 --> 03:05:35,361
[SPEAKER_12]: So, just two points of interest.

2567
03:05:35,441 --> 03:05:40,605
[SPEAKER_12]: Like I said, I've just been seeing a lot of empty spots in front of these businesses.

2568
03:05:42,026 --> 03:05:43,847
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, nobody's parking there anymore.

2569
03:05:44,088 --> 03:05:45,969
[SPEAKER_12]: Certainly not the customers, that's for sure.

2570
03:05:46,009 --> 03:05:47,150
[SPEAKER_12]: They're not pulling over there.

2571
03:05:47,650 --> 03:05:48,591
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

2572
03:05:48,631 --> 03:05:48,991
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

2573
03:05:49,011 --> 03:05:49,592
[SPEAKER_12]: Appreciate it.

2574
03:05:50,153 --> 03:05:52,174
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a motion for approval on the floor.

2575
03:05:53,255 --> 03:06:03,382
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion by Councilor Penta for this discussion, amended by Councilor Brianna Lungel-Kern and amended by Councilor Camuso twice.

2576
03:06:09,867 --> 03:06:10,967
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Caraviello.

2577
03:06:11,508 --> 03:06:11,848
[SPEAKER_16]: Chief.

2578
03:06:13,609 --> 03:06:15,110
[SPEAKER_16]: Chief, if I can bother you one more time.

2579
03:06:18,453 --> 03:06:18,593
[SPEAKER_16]: Chief,

2580
03:06:19,762 --> 03:06:28,310
[SPEAKER_16]: In the springtime, Chief, in the springtime, there's going to be construction starting in the square, the bridge.

2581
03:06:28,871 --> 03:06:31,093
[SPEAKER_16]: What are we going to be doing when the construction starts?

2582
03:06:32,334 --> 03:06:36,117
[SPEAKER_09]: When they brief me on what the construction period looks like, it keeps getting pushed out.

2583
03:06:36,157 --> 03:06:42,043
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, if it starts in the spring— Eventually, it's going to— Yeah, eventually— Well, from what I understand, it's supposed to be starting in the spring because they're putting the bridge in.

2584
03:06:44,141 --> 03:06:44,722
[SPEAKER_09]: It's supposed to.

2585
03:06:44,782 --> 03:06:46,124
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't seen the latest plans.

2586
03:06:46,484 --> 03:06:47,725
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure it will be included.

2587
03:06:47,765 --> 03:06:51,830
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there going to be some easing of some things once the construction starts?

2588
03:06:51,850 --> 03:06:53,251
[SPEAKER_09]: Almost by necessity.

2589
03:06:53,351 --> 03:06:59,798
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, there will probably be some packing that will be eliminated temporarily so that this project can be accommodated.

2590
03:06:59,938 --> 03:07:03,162
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a two-year project, if I'm not mistaken.

2591
03:07:04,083 --> 03:07:05,604
[SPEAKER_09]: The last I heard, it was closer to three.

2592
03:07:08,912 --> 03:07:13,834
[SPEAKER_09]: But I haven't seen the latest plans, and I know every time they say they're going to start, it seems to get pushed out another six months.

2593
03:07:13,854 --> 03:07:18,056
[SPEAKER_09]: So I can't answer it until I hear more.

2594
03:07:18,076 --> 03:07:18,476
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President?

2595
03:07:21,177 --> 03:07:21,978
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Camuso.

2596
03:07:22,338 --> 03:07:22,698
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2597
03:07:23,018 --> 03:07:29,301
[SPEAKER_18]: And I heard Councilor Prentis saying continue this next week for further discussion.

2598
03:07:29,501 --> 03:07:34,803
[SPEAKER_18]: But let's not discuss the same thing week after week after week.

2599
03:07:35,144 --> 03:07:38,105
[SPEAKER_18]: This is, I think, I'm just making my point known.

2600
03:07:39,135 --> 03:07:40,776
[SPEAKER_18]: There are legitimate concerns out there.

2601
03:07:40,856 --> 03:07:42,277
[SPEAKER_18]: We want to hear legitimate concerns.

2602
03:07:42,917 --> 03:07:47,419
[SPEAKER_18]: But for people to think that we can just make this program go away, now the mayor signed a contract.

2603
03:07:47,939 --> 03:07:52,221
[SPEAKER_18]: Call the mayor's office, voice your concerns with him if you have an issue.

2604
03:07:52,902 --> 03:07:57,424
[SPEAKER_18]: But the fact of the matter is, this council always is here to hear the citizens of this community.

2605
03:07:57,964 --> 03:08:06,068
[SPEAKER_18]: But week after week after week after week after week, bring the legitimate concerns to the members of the Medford City Council.

2606
03:08:06,088 --> 03:08:08,269
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll be here to meet your needs, hopefully.

2607
03:08:08,630 --> 03:08:09,791
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll put you in the right direction.

2608
03:08:10,432 --> 03:08:11,092
[SPEAKER_18]: Call us any day.

2609
03:08:11,112 --> 03:08:17,378
[SPEAKER_18]: You don't have to wait for Tuesday night to come down here because I can speak for all the members of my council, colleagues that sit around here.

2610
03:08:18,319 --> 03:08:25,166
[SPEAKER_18]: We respond to people and we try to get them the solutions that they may not like the solution, but it will at least put them in the right direction.

2611
03:08:25,886 --> 03:08:31,852
[SPEAKER_18]: So, but I just think at some point we have to stop crying that the program's here.

2612
03:08:32,372 --> 03:08:33,934
[SPEAKER_18]: We have to look to make the program better.

2613
03:08:34,865 --> 03:08:35,565
[SPEAKER_18]: and less.

2614
03:08:35,745 --> 03:08:44,827
[SPEAKER_14]: It was offered by councillor Caraviello some, uh, time ago that we, uh, revisit this after a period of, I think 60 days.

2615
03:08:45,387 --> 03:09:03,031
[SPEAKER_14]: So perhaps with the, uh, being of the gavel on these motions, uh, tonight that 60 days is the appropriate, uh, period of time for us to revisit this, having given it a chance to work its way out during one of the most, uh, uh, councillor Mox.

2616
03:09:04,333 --> 03:09:04,994
[SPEAKER_04]: I disagree.

2617
03:09:05,194 --> 03:09:07,035
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we need to discuss this every week.

2618
03:09:07,735 --> 03:09:18,820
[SPEAKER_04]: And point of fact is that — Mr. President, a week ago, there was a surcharge of $3 for resident permit parking.

2619
03:09:19,461 --> 03:09:21,302
[SPEAKER_04]: The gentleman went back to his higher-ups.

2620
03:09:21,362 --> 03:09:24,763
[SPEAKER_04]: He met with the administration, and now there's no $3 surcharge.

2621
03:09:24,783 --> 03:09:25,664
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a week ago.

2622
03:09:26,224 --> 03:09:32,607
[SPEAKER_04]: We had residents that came up here that had concerns about parking in front of their building and so forth, and the chief has been addressing them one at a time.

2623
03:09:32,957 --> 03:09:35,689
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had concerns about kiosks in front of residential homes.

2624
03:09:36,071 --> 03:09:37,457
[SPEAKER_04]: Those have been addressed one at a time.

2625
03:09:37,931 --> 03:09:41,932
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, in my opinion, you can send the mayor an email, good luck getting a response.

2626
03:09:42,272 --> 03:09:46,332
[SPEAKER_04]: You can call his office three dozen times like residents have told me with no response.

2627
03:09:46,913 --> 03:09:53,074
[SPEAKER_04]: I would prefer, this is the only open public forum in this city, and this is where we're currently getting action.

2628
03:09:53,414 --> 03:09:54,494
[SPEAKER_04]: We're seeing results.

2629
03:09:55,054 --> 03:09:57,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Why should we say let's meet in two months from now?

2630
03:09:57,554 --> 03:10:02,175
[SPEAKER_04]: We're seeing results, and this is such a fluid process that we've all spoke about.

2631
03:10:02,575 --> 03:10:03,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Why should we wait?

2632
03:10:03,795 --> 03:10:06,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Week after week, if no one comes out next week, then we don't discuss it.

2633
03:10:07,456 --> 03:10:10,358
[SPEAKER_04]: But it should be an option where residents can come up every week.

2634
03:10:10,658 --> 03:10:13,520
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the only forum to allow them to speak, Mr. President.

2635
03:10:13,880 --> 03:10:17,623
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wholeheartedly support having this here in a weekly fashion.

2636
03:10:18,123 --> 03:10:25,508
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's three weeks, four weeks, five months, five years, as long as we keep this forum open for the people, we're doing our job, Mr. President.

2637
03:10:26,009 --> 03:10:27,930
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to stick by that.

2638
03:10:28,270 --> 03:10:35,115
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would say that I would like to see a continuation of this next week, Mr. President, and have it on the agenda as an open item.

2639
03:10:35,580 --> 03:10:38,522
[SPEAKER_04]: when people can come up and discuss this at any time, Mr. President.

2640
03:10:40,523 --> 03:10:43,184
[SPEAKER_03]: The Press Thank you, President de la Ruzo.

2641
03:10:44,065 --> 03:10:46,426
[SPEAKER_03]: I concur with Counselor Marks.

2642
03:10:46,466 --> 03:10:47,547
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is a play.

2643
03:10:47,767 --> 03:10:54,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only have we answered concerns in the last two weeks, we've given our concerns to the Chief.

2644
03:10:54,391 --> 03:10:55,392
[SPEAKER_03]: The Chief's been here.

2645
03:10:55,452 --> 03:10:57,153
[SPEAKER_03]: We've brought awareness to the program.

2646
03:10:57,193 --> 03:10:58,133
[SPEAKER_03]: We've helped through the Chief.

2647
03:10:59,890 --> 03:11:05,933
[SPEAKER_03]: answer questions, we're making the administration aware of concerns, and it's just a place that people can come.

2648
03:11:05,953 --> 03:11:09,235
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree with the same concerns over and over again.

2649
03:11:09,355 --> 03:11:24,544
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, we need to maybe do something with those concerns, whether it's a committee of the whole meeting, but if a resident, a business owner, anybody in this community has a new concern or a concern that they need to bring to the council, even if it is repeatedly, then so be it.

2650
03:11:24,924 --> 03:11:26,625
[SPEAKER_03]: We are the only public forum

2651
03:11:27,221 --> 03:11:39,065
[SPEAKER_03]: These meetings and open public forum type meetings about the parking program should have been had by the mayor's office far before tonight and last week.

2652
03:11:39,345 --> 03:11:43,107
[SPEAKER_03]: And we as a council asked the mayor to have public meetings before this was installed.

2653
03:11:43,467 --> 03:11:49,049
[SPEAKER_03]: We made recommendations, we asked questions, but it was done how it was done, and this is the place.

2654
03:11:49,309 --> 03:11:54,351
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we have to be here till the late hours of the Tuesday nights, then so be it.

2655
03:11:54,831 --> 03:11:55,652
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Council.

2656
03:11:55,692 --> 03:11:56,872
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Lagocurin.

2657
03:11:57,306 --> 03:11:58,827
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Camuso, did you have something?

2658
03:11:58,847 --> 03:12:00,789
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

2659
03:12:00,809 --> 03:12:02,531
[SPEAKER_17]: Sir, your name and address for the record, please.

2660
03:12:02,651 --> 03:12:04,272
[SPEAKER_17]: Joe Viglione, 59 Garfield Ave.

2661
03:12:04,573 --> 03:12:07,655
[SPEAKER_17]: This is one of the most expensive city councils in the Commonwealth.

2662
03:12:08,656 --> 03:12:11,719
[SPEAKER_17]: The taxpayers just had to pay for a new raise for the city council.

2663
03:12:12,139 --> 03:12:14,321
[SPEAKER_17]: I thank the three councilors that didn't vote for this.

2664
03:12:15,122 --> 03:12:18,085
[SPEAKER_17]: It's interesting that the councilors that did vote, please stop interrupting.

2665
03:12:18,105 --> 03:12:19,886
[SPEAKER_18]: Point of information, Councilor Camuso.

2666
03:12:20,226 --> 03:12:20,767
[SPEAKER_18]: First of all,

2667
03:12:21,468 --> 03:12:24,469
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll call a point of information any time I want.

2668
03:12:24,489 --> 03:12:27,230
[SPEAKER_18]: You have no status in this community, a fine American once said.

2669
03:12:27,810 --> 03:12:31,031
[SPEAKER_18]: A fine American once said that.

2670
03:12:31,331 --> 03:12:32,471
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President.

2671
03:12:33,032 --> 03:12:34,452
[SPEAKER_18]: Your point of information, Counselor.

2672
03:12:34,692 --> 03:12:36,633
[SPEAKER_18]: The votes were unanimous on the parking program.

2673
03:12:36,753 --> 03:12:38,633
[SPEAKER_18]: So the gentleman makes up fiction.

2674
03:12:40,354 --> 03:12:41,574
[SPEAKER_18]: The facts of the record don't lie.

2675
03:12:41,754 --> 03:12:42,614
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Counselor.

2676
03:12:43,235 --> 03:12:44,575
[SPEAKER_17]: Sir, if you could continue, please.

2677
03:12:44,775 --> 03:12:45,515
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much.

2678
03:12:45,575 --> 03:12:48,456
[SPEAKER_17]: This is one of the most expensive city councils in the Commonwealth.

2679
03:12:48,496 --> 03:12:50,717
[SPEAKER_17]: We have no public access TV that we pay for.

2680
03:12:52,048 --> 03:12:56,270
[SPEAKER_17]: The councillors that carry the mayor's water, they might want to silence us.

2681
03:12:56,630 --> 03:12:57,910
[SPEAKER_17]: This is the people's forum.

2682
03:12:57,970 --> 03:13:03,973
[SPEAKER_17]: The same councillors that say it's the people's forum are the ones that want to shut down the conversation.

2683
03:13:04,513 --> 03:13:05,593
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councillor Marks.

2684
03:13:05,673 --> 03:13:07,354
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councillor Longo-Kern.

2685
03:13:07,394 --> 03:13:08,615
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councillor Penta.

2686
03:13:09,075 --> 03:13:14,537
[SPEAKER_17]: This has to be talked about because we weren't even aware of this and there's no public access TV.

2687
03:13:15,057 --> 03:13:18,519
[SPEAKER_17]: So until there is public access TV, there's no rule, what is it, 17?

2688
03:13:20,030 --> 03:13:20,830
[SPEAKER_17]: vote.

2689
03:13:20,850 --> 03:13:21,170
[SPEAKER_17]: 90 days?

2690
03:13:21,330 --> 03:13:21,751
[SPEAKER_17]: Forget it.

2691
03:13:22,271 --> 03:13:26,852
[SPEAKER_17]: Suspension of the rules every week until we get this issue front and center.

2692
03:13:31,294 --> 03:13:32,134
[SPEAKER_14]: Councillor Knight.

2693
03:13:38,957 --> 03:13:40,717
[SPEAKER_14]: Councillor Knight has the floor.

2694
03:13:41,277 --> 03:13:41,998
[SPEAKER_14]: Councillor Knight.

2695
03:13:44,278 --> 03:13:46,019
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

2696
03:13:47,700 --> 03:13:49,020
[SPEAKER_11]: I certainly don't have a problem

2697
03:13:49,717 --> 03:13:59,301
[SPEAKER_11]: having dialogue and hearing from individuals that have concern over the parking management program, the parking enhancement program, the revenue enhancement program or whatever it is that we're all calling it.

2698
03:13:59,942 --> 03:14:11,247
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I just think it's very important that if in fact we're going to have people come up here to speak to this council, we give them the opportunity to do so because they have to wake up tomorrow morning and go to work and keeping them here from seven o'clock until 10 30 or 11 o'clock at night.

2699
03:14:11,594 --> 03:14:15,740
[SPEAKER_11]: for them to have the opportunity to come up to this podium and speak, I think is a little bit much to ask.

2700
03:14:15,780 --> 03:14:27,036
[SPEAKER_11]: So in the future, I think, Mr. President, it might make sense when we have people from the general public that are here that want to raise questions and want to have answers about this parking program, that they're allowed to speak first, Mr. President, so that we can let them get their questions out.

2701
03:14:27,276 --> 03:14:28,777
[SPEAKER_11]: we can let them get their questions answered.

2702
03:14:29,037 --> 03:14:31,519
[SPEAKER_11]: That's going to raise questions that we have, obviously, and absolutely.

2703
03:14:31,539 --> 03:14:32,580
[SPEAKER_11]: There's no question about that.

2704
03:14:32,900 --> 03:14:38,584
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think we are in a unique position when we have access to the people from Republic, to the Traffic Commission, to the Chief.

2705
03:14:39,085 --> 03:14:42,207
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, Chief Sacco is probably tired of hearing from me at this point in time.

2706
03:14:42,247 --> 03:14:42,948
[SPEAKER_11]: I call him so much.

2707
03:14:43,528 --> 03:14:48,452
[SPEAKER_11]: But at the end of the day, we have access, and the individuals in the community don't have that same access that we have, Mr. President.

2708
03:14:48,472 --> 03:14:50,293
[SPEAKER_11]: I have no problem continuing this conversation.

2709
03:14:50,313 --> 03:14:55,417
[SPEAKER_11]: I have no problem staying here until tomorrow morning if we have to, to listen to the concerns of the residents.

2710
03:14:55,863 --> 03:14:58,865
[SPEAKER_11]: To listen to those concerns, I have no problem whatsoever, Mr. President.

2711
03:14:58,905 --> 03:15:05,269
[SPEAKER_11]: When it turns into political theater and a little bit less more about action and results is when I get concerned, Mr. President.

2712
03:15:05,509 --> 03:15:08,350
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm not saying that that's happening, but I'm saying it has the potential to happen.

2713
03:15:08,671 --> 03:15:14,714
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think right now we're in a spot where we've had three or four meetings on the same topic, and they've gone late into the night.

2714
03:15:15,094 --> 03:15:21,278
[SPEAKER_11]: They've gone late into the night, but most of the people from the general public haven't even had an opportunity to express their concerns until 9 or 10 o'clock in the evening.

2715
03:15:21,578 --> 03:15:28,882
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think it would make more sense moving forward and be more encouraging for people to come out if in fact they could come here and take the floor immediately.

2716
03:15:29,222 --> 03:15:32,404
[SPEAKER_11]: Or they could come here and they could be heard first without interruption and then we can move forward.

2717
03:15:32,424 --> 03:15:38,587
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm guilty of it just as much as anybody else behind here with my points of information and with my questions and my concerns in between speakers lining up.

2718
03:15:38,947 --> 03:15:42,389
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think if we're going to move forward and we're going to be serious about speaking about this issue,

2719
03:15:42,796 --> 03:15:48,458
[SPEAKER_11]: and speaking about it every week because we want results for the concerns that are being raised, then we need to let those concerns reach the floor.

2720
03:15:48,479 --> 03:15:56,202
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to let those concerns resonate and saturate, and we need to give the chief an opportunity to address them before we start chiming in with our two cents.

2721
03:15:56,562 --> 03:15:57,262
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a process.

2722
03:15:57,422 --> 03:15:58,403
[SPEAKER_11]: The process is in place.

2723
03:15:58,423 --> 03:16:01,524
[SPEAKER_11]: We know what the process is if we have problems, questions, concerns, and grievances.

2724
03:16:01,964 --> 03:16:05,246
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that at the end of the day, they're not falling on deaf ears.

2725
03:16:05,286 --> 03:16:06,426
[SPEAKER_11]: We're seeing a lot of success.

2726
03:16:06,466 --> 03:16:07,827
[SPEAKER_11]: Councillor Marks is absolutely right.

2727
03:16:08,173 --> 03:16:10,555
[SPEAKER_11]: Why would we close this down right now when we're seeing results?

2728
03:16:10,635 --> 03:16:13,278
[SPEAKER_11]: We're seeing results left and right.

2729
03:16:13,318 --> 03:16:22,045
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have a problem keeping it open, Mr. President, but I would like to see maybe more of a commitment to allowing the residents really express themselves and a little bit less of us interrupting them.

2730
03:16:22,105 --> 03:16:25,348
[SPEAKER_11]: And like I said, I'm guilty of it just as much as anybody else, Mr. President.

2731
03:16:25,869 --> 03:16:29,232
[SPEAKER_11]: So I have no problem keeping the matter open weekly, monthly.

2732
03:16:29,823 --> 03:16:39,787
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, in subcommittee, um, if we want to maybe all convene, um, on the Wednesday night, we can meet down there when the chief is having his presentation with the people of Republic, um, Wednesday night at his public safety meeting.

2733
03:16:40,120 --> 03:16:40,660
[SPEAKER_11]: Something like that.

2734
03:16:40,701 --> 03:16:42,282
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm open to all suggestions, Mr. President.

2735
03:16:42,302 --> 03:16:49,027
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to be sure that the people coming up here feel as though they're going to be heard, because I've seen a number of people that were here in the audience walking around and get up and leave.

2736
03:16:49,047 --> 03:16:51,409
[SPEAKER_11]: Like Mr. Tomazak was here last week, and he ended up leaving.

2737
03:16:51,469 --> 03:16:56,853
[SPEAKER_11]: I saw a couple of other residents in the audience that were here as long as they could be here, and they left.

2738
03:16:56,933 --> 03:16:59,675
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just think that it's important they get their chance to speak.

2739
03:16:59,755 --> 03:17:01,197
[SPEAKER_11]: We have this forum every week.

2740
03:17:01,497 --> 03:17:09,403
[SPEAKER_14]: And we tried to do that, as you know, and I just tried to facilitate an avenue for that to happen last week, and by moving it,

2741
03:17:09,831 --> 03:17:18,474
[SPEAKER_14]: to expedite some other small businesses, pieces of business early to give a solid block of time to the citizens.

2742
03:17:18,954 --> 03:17:22,415
[SPEAKER_14]: But Councilor Lungo-Kern has called to move the question.

2743
03:17:23,455 --> 03:17:24,395
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Mox.

2744
03:17:27,276 --> 03:17:39,580
[SPEAKER_04]: To that end that Councilor Mike was just talking about, I agree that residents should speak first, but I would also say that when residents are at the podium, members of the council should pay attention

2745
03:17:40,388 --> 03:17:44,689
[SPEAKER_04]: They shouldn't be working the audience, walking around glad handing, which happens a lot.

2746
03:17:44,709 --> 03:17:53,810
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to point at anyone in particular, but some members sit behind here and we listen diligently and other members are working the crowd trying to get votes.

2747
03:17:54,390 --> 03:18:04,212
[SPEAKER_04]: So in one aspect we're saying we want to be kind to the residents and listen to what they have to say, but when they get up to the podium, some members of this council could give a damn what the residents have to say.

2748
03:18:05,072 --> 03:18:06,092
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's wrong.

2749
03:18:06,172 --> 03:18:09,373
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've noticed that more and more now and I take exception to it.

2750
03:18:10,034 --> 03:18:20,222
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would hope there's a change by this council that when people are at the podium, we give them the respect they deserve and we sit and listen and not traverse the whole building.

2751
03:18:20,663 --> 03:18:22,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Because to me, that's unacceptable.

2752
03:18:23,965 --> 03:18:24,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Parker.

2753
03:18:26,928 --> 03:18:27,969
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Carfiello.

2754
03:18:28,649 --> 03:18:29,250
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2755
03:18:29,490 --> 03:18:36,115
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, why can't we do a council of the whole meeting with the mayor next week, before our meeting at five o'clock?

2756
03:18:37,425 --> 03:18:39,746
[SPEAKER_16]: and express our concerns directly to the mayor.

2757
03:18:40,507 --> 03:18:48,571
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll call for the meeting first thing tomorrow, five o'clock next Tuesday, committee of the whole vacation.

2758
03:18:49,848 --> 03:18:51,689
[SPEAKER_05]: There you are, you're taking it away from the public.

2759
03:18:51,950 --> 03:18:54,392
[SPEAKER_05]: Have the mayor come to a council meeting where he belongs.

2760
03:18:54,852 --> 03:18:57,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Not in a committee of the whole meeting.

2761
03:18:57,394 --> 03:19:00,096
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Pinto, if I can.

2762
03:19:00,616 --> 03:19:00,756
[SPEAKER_14]: What?

2763
03:19:00,836 --> 03:19:03,819
[SPEAKER_14]: As you know, for 30 years, you've asked him to come.

2764
03:19:03,919 --> 03:19:07,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if he's not going to come, he's telling the people, he's slapping them.

2765
03:19:07,041 --> 03:19:07,622
[SPEAKER_05]: He doesn't care.

2766
03:19:07,642 --> 03:19:08,923
[SPEAKER_05]: He doesn't care.

2767
03:19:09,103 --> 03:19:10,684
[SPEAKER_05]: And they'll do what they have to do in November.

2768
03:19:10,704 --> 03:19:12,285
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll either vote him out or vote him in.

2769
03:19:12,345 --> 03:19:12,785
[SPEAKER_05]: One or the other.

2770
03:19:12,805 --> 03:19:14,227
[SPEAKER_16]: So what makes them think he's going to come next week?

2771
03:19:14,996 --> 03:19:26,360
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, what do you want to go play the whole tool, uh, to do what, to discuss this and bring further input from citizens and we'll meet with the chief and a representative from Republican parkings.

2772
03:19:28,140 --> 03:19:33,802
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, and then we will discuss it again at seven o'clock and then we'll discuss it again at seven o'clock at the council meeting.

2773
03:19:34,382 --> 03:19:35,683
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll discuss whatever took place.

2774
03:19:35,943 --> 03:19:39,286
[SPEAKER_05]: And the poor people that have to come down here are going to want to know why.

2775
03:19:39,386 --> 03:19:41,227
[SPEAKER_16]: The residents are open to come.

2776
03:19:41,367 --> 03:19:42,408
[SPEAKER_05]: But everybody has to work.

2777
03:19:42,448 --> 03:19:43,069
[SPEAKER_05]: People have to work.

2778
03:19:43,089 --> 03:19:44,370
[SPEAKER_05]: They have families they have to deal with.

2779
03:19:44,670 --> 03:19:46,891
[SPEAKER_05]: They know 7 o'clock Tuesday night is a council meeting.

2780
03:19:47,092 --> 03:19:48,192
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an open public forum.

2781
03:19:48,513 --> 03:19:51,155
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody can come here, including the mayor.

2782
03:19:51,215 --> 03:19:52,115
[SPEAKER_16]: And he chooses not to.

2783
03:19:52,155 --> 03:19:52,596
[SPEAKER_16]: You're correct.

2784
03:19:52,636 --> 03:19:53,837
[SPEAKER_16]: The mayor chooses not to come here.

2785
03:19:53,877 --> 03:19:56,699
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not our fault that the mayor chooses not to come here, councillor.

2786
03:19:56,919 --> 03:19:57,860
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what he's afraid of.

2787
03:19:58,100 --> 03:19:59,821
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, then let's move the question here.

2788
03:19:59,861 --> 03:20:03,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Move it that he appear before the Memphis City Council, not the Committee of the Whole.

2789
03:20:05,545 --> 03:20:07,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Invite him to the Memphis City Council next Tuesday.

2790
03:20:07,306 --> 03:20:08,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we not want a Committee of the Whole meeting?

2791
03:20:09,447 --> 03:20:10,507
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd like to continue that.

2792
03:20:10,887 --> 03:20:11,047
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

2793
03:20:11,747 --> 03:20:13,128
[SPEAKER_13]: You'd like to have a Committee of the Whole meeting?

2794
03:20:13,288 --> 03:20:15,169
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd like to have a Committee of the Whole.

2795
03:20:15,189 --> 03:20:17,409
[SPEAKER_13]: Do any of the other councillors wish to have one?

2796
03:20:18,130 --> 03:20:18,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call vote.

2797
03:20:20,010 --> 03:20:22,111
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, the chair calls the Committee of the Whole meetings.

2798
03:20:22,291 --> 03:20:26,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'd like to have them appear before the council.

2799
03:20:26,833 --> 03:20:28,033
[SPEAKER_05]: What are we going to do over here?

2800
03:20:28,053 --> 03:20:31,134
[SPEAKER_05]: Be third party to repeat back?

2801
03:20:31,174 --> 03:20:32,895
[SPEAKER_14]: Point of information, Councillor Camuso.

2802
03:20:34,462 --> 03:20:36,766
[SPEAKER_18]: I would absolutely love to have him here.

2803
03:20:37,528 --> 03:20:45,703
[SPEAKER_18]: The fact of the matter is if we want to actually get answers and not yell and scream to get him here when we know he's not coming,

2804
03:20:46,573 --> 03:20:48,874
[SPEAKER_18]: Listen, the best predictor of the future is the past.

2805
03:20:49,154 --> 03:20:55,417
[SPEAKER_18]: And for the past 30 years, whether I believe it's right, wrong, or indifferent, the next mayor of this community, I'm sure, will be at this podium.

2806
03:20:55,857 --> 03:20:57,598
[SPEAKER_18]: But for the last 30 years, he has not been.

2807
03:20:58,279 --> 03:21:05,022
[SPEAKER_18]: With that being said, if we really want answers, if we really want to give the citizens an opportunity to ask him questions,

2808
03:21:06,327 --> 03:21:29,415
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's do it where the past the past is the best predictor of the future Those things have been answered and that was in the committee of the whole Now we can come out from that committee of the whole and discuss it here on the floor But if it's anything more than theatrics calling for him to come here He's been here once and it was the methadone clinic once you've been here in the city of Medford as a council longer than him as the mayor and he's been here once Once and why was he here?

2809
03:21:29,455 --> 03:21:30,915
[SPEAKER_18]: Tell us why because the methadone clinic

2810
03:21:30,995 --> 03:21:31,535
[SPEAKER_18]: And why?

2811
03:21:31,555 --> 03:21:32,415
[SPEAKER_18]: There was 300 people here.

2812
03:21:32,455 --> 03:21:32,855
[SPEAKER_18]: That's right.

2813
03:21:32,895 --> 03:21:33,516
[SPEAKER_18]: There was 300 people here.

2814
03:21:33,636 --> 03:21:34,556
[SPEAKER_18]: And he outspotted all of you.

2815
03:21:34,576 --> 03:21:35,996
[SPEAKER_18]: So on the way in, they're throwing rocks at him.

2816
03:21:36,016 --> 03:21:37,617
[SPEAKER_18]: They were carrying him out on their shoulders.

2817
03:21:37,937 --> 03:21:38,097
[SPEAKER_18]: What?

2818
03:21:38,237 --> 03:21:39,557
[SPEAKER_18]: So learn something from the guy.

2819
03:21:39,577 --> 03:21:40,297
[SPEAKER_18]: What are you talking about?

2820
03:21:40,317 --> 03:21:41,097
[SPEAKER_18]: There's 20 years ahead of you.

2821
03:21:41,778 --> 03:21:44,438
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's have him at the Committee of the Whole and get the answers that are important.

2822
03:21:44,738 --> 03:21:48,459
[SPEAKER_14]: So we'll have a Committee of the Whole at 530 next week.

2823
03:21:48,819 --> 03:22:00,062
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll also, on the motion of Councilor Penta, that the citizens have the opportunity to redress this issue.

2824
03:22:00,727 --> 03:22:22,845
[SPEAKER_14]: uh... in next week uh... at the seven o'clock meeting that will be uh... part of this uh... resolution that is before us so that councilor camuso you call it for the committee of the whole you're gonna call for it we're taking a vote on it?

2825
03:22:22,865 --> 03:22:28,690
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm gonna call for a committee of the whole for five thirty next tuesday night in addition

2826
03:22:29,675 --> 03:22:45,558
[SPEAKER_14]: on the motion of Councilor Penta, uh, that this discussion be continued in next week so that the citizens might have the opportunity to address further issues that that will be part of this resolution that we're disposing of.

2827
03:22:45,738 --> 03:22:56,220
[SPEAKER_18]: And furthermore, as I stated, people that are out there that have concerns like the mom and pop businesses, loading zones, things of that nature, call any member of this council.

2828
03:22:57,672 --> 03:23:00,194
[SPEAKER_18]: There's certain members on this council that called for these kiosks in 09.

2829
03:23:00,234 --> 03:23:02,516
[SPEAKER_18]: We want to get you the answers that are important to you.

2830
03:23:02,956 --> 03:23:03,436
[SPEAKER_18]: Believe me.

2831
03:23:04,117 --> 03:23:15,425
[SPEAKER_18]: So if we can just have the open dialogue and people don't have to wait till Tuesday if they don't want to, because as councilor Caviello stated the last few weeks, there's ongoing dialogue every single day.

2832
03:23:15,465 --> 03:23:17,947
[SPEAKER_18]: The chief 90% of your day I'm sure is this now, right?

2833
03:23:19,068 --> 03:23:20,429
[SPEAKER_18]: So thank you.

2834
03:23:20,769 --> 03:23:21,050
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2835
03:23:25,333 --> 03:23:40,838
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's going to place on the agenda for next week that this discussion continue?

2836
03:23:58,017 --> 03:24:04,541
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, we have three pieces for resolution and then so we'll move the three questions.

2837
03:24:06,643 --> 03:24:07,203
[SPEAKER_14]: Roll call.

2838
03:24:07,263 --> 03:24:19,691
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're doing the amendments in the main resolution, right?

2839
03:24:19,711 --> 03:24:20,812
[SPEAKER_15]: Right, the three amendments.

2840
03:24:21,432 --> 03:24:22,573
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, Councilor Camuso.

2841
03:24:23,960 --> 03:24:24,761
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Caviello?

2842
03:24:24,801 --> 03:24:24,961
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

2843
03:24:25,761 --> 03:24:26,321
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Knight?

2844
03:24:26,442 --> 03:24:26,582
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

2845
03:24:26,942 --> 03:24:27,942
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Lionel Kern?

2846
03:24:28,103 --> 03:24:28,223
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

2847
03:24:28,703 --> 03:24:29,283
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Marks?

2848
03:24:29,603 --> 03:24:29,784
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

2849
03:24:30,284 --> 03:24:30,764
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Penta?

2850
03:24:30,784 --> 03:24:30,864
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

2851
03:24:31,865 --> 03:24:33,226
[SPEAKER_15]: President DelaRusso?

2852
03:24:33,926 --> 03:24:34,346
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

2853
03:24:36,067 --> 03:24:38,169
[SPEAKER_14]: Seven in the affirmative, none negative.

2854
03:24:38,889 --> 03:24:39,850
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

2855
03:24:40,310 --> 03:24:41,231
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Penta?

2856
03:24:45,653 --> 03:24:45,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

2857
03:24:45,753 --> 03:24:46,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Move the question.

2858
03:24:46,734 --> 03:24:49,616
[SPEAKER_14]: Move the question to continue this discussion.

2859
03:24:50,036 --> 03:24:50,917
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to table that?

2860
03:24:51,357 --> 03:24:52,838
[SPEAKER_15]: No, we're going to continue it to the next page.

2861
03:24:54,108 --> 03:25:12,237
[SPEAKER_15]: You're going to put it on the agenda as a resolution.

2862
03:25:12,258 --> 03:25:13,518
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2863
03:25:13,538 --> 03:25:15,299
[SPEAKER_14]: 15-013 offered by Councillor Knight.

2864
03:25:16,039 --> 03:25:22,863
[SPEAKER_14]: Be it resolved that the city clerk provide the city council with a listing of appointments under council purview

2865
03:25:23,374 --> 03:25:28,397
[SPEAKER_14]: for the purpose of establishing a performance evaluation criteria.

2866
03:25:28,497 --> 03:25:29,338
[SPEAKER_14]: Counselor Knight.

2867
03:25:30,218 --> 03:25:31,619
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

2868
03:25:31,919 --> 03:25:38,504
[SPEAKER_11]: This resolution is no more than an attempt to institute best practices of human resource management here within the council.

2869
03:25:39,164 --> 03:25:42,366
[SPEAKER_11]: There are several positions that are under council purview relative to appointment.

2870
03:25:43,137 --> 03:25:54,345
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to see if we can maybe establish job descriptions for those positions as well as a performance evaluation tool to determine that the people that we do appoint to these roles are actually meeting the obligations that we feel as though are necessary.

2871
03:25:54,985 --> 03:25:55,446
[SPEAKER_11]: Very good.

2872
03:25:55,586 --> 03:25:56,546
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Light.

2873
03:25:57,087 --> 03:25:57,827
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Penta.

2874
03:25:57,967 --> 03:26:10,576
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm really, I'm confused with this resolution here now because as Councilor Light alluded to last year, he said in December, he was working with the city clerk going back to last June, going over some of these positions and then,

2875
03:26:10,992 --> 03:26:20,897
[SPEAKER_05]: The biggest position that we have on the council agenda on our council forum is president and vice president, because they're the ones that have to set the tempo for who gets these positions and how we're going to get to there.

2876
03:26:21,318 --> 03:26:22,799
[SPEAKER_05]: And neither one of those were vetted out.

2877
03:26:23,199 --> 03:26:25,460
[SPEAKER_05]: But now, all of a sudden, we're going to vet out other positions.

2878
03:26:25,520 --> 03:26:26,921
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just don't understand that.

2879
03:26:27,001 --> 03:26:30,883
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to support this, because there's absolutely no — there's no rhyme or reason to this.

2880
03:26:30,923 --> 03:26:38,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if that be the case, Mr. President, you've got no authority to make any appointments right now to any committees, because every one of those positions need to be vetted out.

2881
03:26:38,867 --> 03:26:39,808
[SPEAKER_05]: And every other position that

2882
03:26:40,169 --> 03:26:45,292
[SPEAKER_05]: comes under the state statute for which a council member is eligible for, it doesn't seem to work.

2883
03:26:46,913 --> 03:26:48,814
[SPEAKER_05]: There's something behind this, and I don't know what it is.

2884
03:26:49,094 --> 03:26:53,736
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think it's unfair to the entire council that we would be talking about something like this now.

2885
03:26:55,017 --> 03:26:56,198
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of information, Mr. President.

2886
03:26:56,358 --> 03:26:58,279
[SPEAKER_11]: Counselor Knight.

2887
03:26:58,539 --> 03:27:08,324
[SPEAKER_11]: As I said, when we had this discussion previously, and the clerk can attest to the fact that I've sent this resolution to him a number of times, and he's been working on going through the statute to determine what positions are

2888
03:27:08,788 --> 03:27:12,730
[SPEAKER_11]: statutorily or by statute under council purview.

2889
03:27:13,751 --> 03:27:14,531
[SPEAKER_11]: Quiet in the chamber.

2890
03:27:15,912 --> 03:27:18,733
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, there are a number of positions by statute that are under council purview.

2891
03:27:19,114 --> 03:27:23,456
[SPEAKER_11]: Embelt, Hornell, the city clerk, the city messenger, the videographers, I believe are other ones.

2892
03:27:23,956 --> 03:27:27,118
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to institute human resources, best practices, Mr. President.

2893
03:27:27,138 --> 03:27:28,959
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think it's unreasonable to have people vetted.

2894
03:27:29,259 --> 03:27:35,722
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think it's unreasonable to have a performance evaluation criteria to be sure that people are meeting the requirements of the position.

2895
03:27:35,742 --> 03:27:36,543
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't think that it's,

2896
03:27:36,949 --> 03:27:41,271
[SPEAKER_11]: a bad idea to have a job description for a job that people are performing, so that we're all on the same page.

2897
03:27:41,491 --> 03:27:42,351
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all I'm trying to do.

2898
03:27:42,371 --> 03:27:43,412
[SPEAKER_11]: There's no ulterior motive.

2899
03:27:43,492 --> 03:27:51,715
[SPEAKER_14]: The point of fact, this body moved that all of the mayor's appointments present resumes to us that we had to approve.

2900
03:27:51,735 --> 03:27:58,297
[SPEAKER_05]: The difference, Mr. President, between the mayor presenting them to us is because the council requested it.

2901
03:27:59,218 --> 03:28:01,739
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we're a small group of people here.

2902
03:28:01,919 --> 03:28:04,660
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you've been working on this since June of last year,

2903
03:28:05,540 --> 03:28:07,520
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is all that you can come up with, and so be it.

2904
03:28:07,841 --> 03:28:10,801
[SPEAKER_05]: The other part of the thing is, then maybe we should have vetted out your opposition.

2905
03:28:11,041 --> 03:28:13,322
[SPEAKER_05]: You were only here three weeks, and you voted yourself a pay raise.

2906
03:28:13,342 --> 03:28:14,082
[SPEAKER_05]: And you voted for it, too.

2907
03:28:14,662 --> 03:28:15,882
[SPEAKER_05]: I did not vote for the pay raise.

2908
03:28:15,922 --> 03:28:16,542
[SPEAKER_05]: You voted for it.

2909
03:28:16,662 --> 03:28:17,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Check the record.

2910
03:28:17,122 --> 03:28:18,663
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you voted for it.

2911
03:28:18,703 --> 03:28:19,743
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care what the record says.

2912
03:28:19,803 --> 03:28:21,403
[SPEAKER_05]: I know what I voted for and what I didn't vote for.

2913
03:28:21,443 --> 03:28:22,303
[SPEAKER_05]: You voted for it.

2914
03:28:22,483 --> 03:28:23,124
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's not it.

2915
03:28:23,324 --> 03:28:26,704
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the whole thing with the problem here.

2916
03:28:26,724 --> 03:28:30,165
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, whoever serves up there as the president of the council has the right to make the introductions.

2917
03:28:30,470 --> 03:28:31,851
[SPEAKER_05]: to whatever the positions might be.

2918
03:28:32,351 --> 03:28:36,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Just as Councilor Caviello, he made a request of the mayor to be on a particular board.

2919
03:28:36,735 --> 03:28:38,076
[SPEAKER_05]: He went there, and he did what he had to do.

2920
03:28:38,276 --> 03:28:39,497
[SPEAKER_05]: These are all political positions.

2921
03:28:40,458 --> 03:28:49,424
[SPEAKER_05]: When, all of a sudden, now we have to put a resume in to become a chairman of a committee or something, or what we've done, or what we haven't done, I thought the answer to that was the people.

2922
03:28:49,825 --> 03:28:50,906
[SPEAKER_05]: The people would vote us out.

2923
03:28:51,226 --> 03:28:51,586
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, again.

2924
03:28:51,606 --> 03:28:52,987
[SPEAKER_05]: The people would vote us in or vote us out for what we do.

2925
03:28:53,007 --> 03:28:53,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of information, Mr. President.

2926
03:28:53,868 --> 03:28:55,349
[SPEAKER_14]: Point of information, Councilor Knight.

2927
03:28:55,369 --> 03:28:58,952
[SPEAKER_11]: The gentleman's taking the ship that's going down a straight road, and he's turning left.

2928
03:28:59,232 --> 03:28:59,432
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2929
03:28:59,728 --> 03:29:01,568
[SPEAKER_11]: This is for appointments that are statutory.

2930
03:29:02,529 --> 03:29:06,529
[SPEAKER_11]: All I wanted to do is say we have the M-Belt, we have Hormel, we have the city clerk, we have the city messenger.

2931
03:29:06,869 --> 03:29:08,590
[SPEAKER_11]: We have two videographers in here.

2932
03:29:08,710 --> 03:29:14,351
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if the videographers know what their job requirements are, their job descriptions are, if there's a base of knowledge that they need in order to have these appointments.

2933
03:29:15,151 --> 03:29:16,491
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I'm looking for, Mr. President.

2934
03:29:16,632 --> 03:29:17,632
[SPEAKER_11]: Best practices.

2935
03:29:17,792 --> 03:29:19,772
[SPEAKER_11]: Best practices in vetting appointments.

2936
03:29:19,832 --> 03:29:20,132
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it.

2937
03:29:20,172 --> 03:29:20,472
[SPEAKER_04]: So noted.

2938
03:29:20,512 --> 03:29:22,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Counselor Mark's point of information.

2939
03:29:22,993 --> 03:29:25,453
[SPEAKER_04]: So why do we need this in the form of a resolution?

2940
03:29:25,573 --> 03:29:28,414
[SPEAKER_04]: The city clerk couldn't get you that information from June of last year?

2941
03:29:28,841 --> 03:29:33,024
[SPEAKER_11]: because I can't operate in a vacuum and create these performance evaluations and job descriptions myself.

2942
03:29:33,184 --> 03:29:39,829
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you could have reached out and found out cause you're asking and hit the city clerk provide the consulate a listing of appointments on the council purview.

2943
03:29:40,430 --> 03:29:42,411
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, he could probably provide that in 10 minutes.

2944
03:29:42,792 --> 03:29:43,232
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, he didn't.

2945
03:29:44,413 --> 03:29:45,674
[SPEAKER_11]: You've been working on it for seven months.

2946
03:29:45,994 --> 03:29:48,516
[SPEAKER_11]: And Eddie, when did I ask you to make the initial request?

2947
03:29:48,536 --> 03:29:56,522
[SPEAKER_15]: We've worked on it several times, but you have to remember that a few of the times that constantly had withdrew the motion,

2948
03:29:57,410 --> 03:29:58,030
[SPEAKER_15]: to go forward.

2949
03:29:58,271 --> 03:30:02,413
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, because you said you were working on finding out if there were any other statutory positions that were out there.

2950
03:30:02,493 --> 03:30:06,395
[SPEAKER_11]: So I said, I'll give you the opportunity to continue to research these statutory positions.

2951
03:30:07,156 --> 03:30:08,336
[SPEAKER_11]: And it came to a point now.

2952
03:30:08,396 --> 03:30:09,657
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been seven months.

2953
03:30:10,017 --> 03:30:10,438
[SPEAKER_11]: Enough's enough.

2954
03:30:10,458 --> 03:30:12,999
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's put the resolution on it to get the teeth in it.

2955
03:30:13,940 --> 03:30:23,025
[SPEAKER_11]: The only reason I brought this resolution forward was to ensure that we're practicing under the best practices out there that's in every single human resource organization across the country.

2956
03:30:23,445 --> 03:30:25,246
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Counselor Camuso.

2957
03:30:26,705 --> 03:30:29,567
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, and I certainly do support this wholeheartedly.

2958
03:30:30,187 --> 03:30:38,753
[SPEAKER_18]: The evening, I think this came up in discussion recently when I put the name of Robert M. Penta forward for the reappointment to the Brooks Estates.

2959
03:30:39,294 --> 03:30:46,799
[SPEAKER_18]: It was actually discussed that evening, and Councilor Knight at the time said that a resolution would be forthcoming after the first of the year, and here it is.

2960
03:30:47,159 --> 03:30:48,840
[SPEAKER_18]: And certainly, I do support this.

2961
03:30:49,481 --> 03:30:52,743
[SPEAKER_18]: We want the best possible people in all these positions.

2962
03:30:54,502 --> 03:30:59,007
[SPEAKER_18]: I support it and I think it's being very proactive and thank you for bringing it forward.

2963
03:30:59,408 --> 03:31:00,629
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Councillor Camuso.

2964
03:31:00,669 --> 03:31:01,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Councillor Pantano.

2965
03:31:01,771 --> 03:31:10,261
[SPEAKER_05]: The best possible people to serve in these positions should be vetted out starting with the president and the vice president and we should just go through that and that's probably what the council should have done

2966
03:31:10,608 --> 03:31:21,191
[SPEAKER_05]: this past year to find out who the best person, not the number one vote getter, not the one who's been here the longest or the shortest, who's accomplished and done the most on the city council, who would make a good representative.

2967
03:31:21,591 --> 03:31:23,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Not because of the political path.

2968
03:31:23,132 --> 03:31:25,492
[SPEAKER_14]: Point of information, Councilor Camuso.

2969
03:31:26,353 --> 03:31:33,074
[SPEAKER_18]: Everyone was vetted and the majority of the council did put the person or people in the leadership positions.

2970
03:31:33,775 --> 03:31:36,135
[SPEAKER_18]: And same as it's been done always.

2971
03:31:36,735 --> 03:31:38,196
[SPEAKER_18]: And just because you may not have the votes,

2972
03:31:39,298 --> 03:31:40,278
[SPEAKER_18]: Cry over sour grapes.

2973
03:31:40,579 --> 03:31:41,739
[SPEAKER_18]: And I appreciate the unanimity of the voting.

2974
03:31:41,819 --> 03:31:42,579
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you talking about?

2975
03:31:42,599 --> 03:31:42,859
[SPEAKER_05]: What votes?

2976
03:31:42,899 --> 03:31:44,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Votes to get the votes.

2977
03:31:44,120 --> 03:31:44,460
[SPEAKER_18]: For what?

2978
03:31:44,580 --> 03:31:46,861
[SPEAKER_18]: The votes to become the president and the vice president.

2979
03:31:47,241 --> 03:31:49,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I didn't ask to become president or vice president.

2980
03:31:49,662 --> 03:31:51,243
[SPEAKER_18]: So don't tell me I didn't have the votes.

2981
03:31:51,263 --> 03:31:51,643
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't ask for it.

2982
03:31:51,663 --> 03:31:52,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, no, no, you didn't.

2983
03:31:52,383 --> 03:31:53,104
[SPEAKER_05]: You didn't have the votes.

2984
03:31:53,384 --> 03:31:54,044
[SPEAKER_18]: I didn't ask for it.

2985
03:31:54,284 --> 03:31:55,084
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, it doesn't matter.

2986
03:31:55,104 --> 03:31:56,445
[SPEAKER_14]: You didn't have them.

2987
03:31:56,485 --> 03:31:57,745
[SPEAKER_14]: How do you know I didn't have them?

2988
03:31:57,765 --> 03:31:59,306
[SPEAKER_14]: We're estranged from our topic.

2989
03:31:59,326 --> 03:32:00,847
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, I'd like to amend the resolution.

2990
03:32:02,385 --> 03:32:06,267
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to strike out the words for the purpose of establishing a performance evaluation criteria.

2991
03:32:06,327 --> 03:32:08,908
[SPEAKER_11]: When the clerk gets the information to me, then I can make a subsequent resolution.

2992
03:32:08,948 --> 03:32:17,593
[SPEAKER_14]: But at this point in time, I'd like to know what... On the amended resolution of Councilor Knight, on the motion for approval by Councilor Knight...

2993
03:32:19,225 --> 03:32:22,808
[SPEAKER_11]: Just striking out the words for the purpose of establishing performance evaluation criteria.

2994
03:32:22,828 --> 03:32:24,029
[SPEAKER_11]: It seems that was a sticking point.

2995
03:32:24,129 --> 03:32:29,394
[SPEAKER_11]: We can have the clerk give us a listing of the positions, and then if I feel as though it's appropriate to move forward with the resolution at a later date, I will.

2996
03:32:29,514 --> 03:32:30,215
[SPEAKER_14]: It's already been done.

2997
03:32:30,335 --> 03:32:30,975
[SPEAKER_14]: It's already been done.

2998
03:32:31,256 --> 03:32:31,596
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2999
03:32:31,836 --> 03:32:33,318
[SPEAKER_14]: Seconded by Councilor Camuso.

3000
03:32:33,378 --> 03:32:34,238
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

3001
03:32:34,258 --> 03:32:34,739
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

3002
03:32:34,939 --> 03:32:35,740
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

3003
03:32:37,041 --> 03:32:37,922
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

3004
03:32:37,942 --> 03:32:45,028
[SPEAKER_14]: 15-015 offered by Councilor Knight under suspension.

3005
03:32:45,690 --> 03:33:02,022
[SPEAKER_14]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council congratulate Aggie Tudin, City of Medford's Tree Warden, on her receipt of the Seth H. Swift Tree Warden of the Year Award, presented by the Massachusetts Tree Wardens and Forestry Association.

3006
03:33:02,523 --> 03:33:05,625
[SPEAKER_14]: Be it further resolved that the City Council invite Ms.

3007
03:33:05,665 --> 03:33:11,809
[SPEAKER_14]: Tudin to appear before the Council to accept a commendation in recognition of this great achievement.

3008
03:33:12,170 --> 03:33:12,830
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight.

3009
03:33:13,551 --> 03:33:14,892
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

3010
03:33:16,038 --> 03:33:21,260
[SPEAKER_11]: Aggie Tootin, our tree warden, was awarded the Seth H. Swift Tree Warden of the Year Award.

3011
03:33:21,820 --> 03:33:27,062
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is the Tree Warden of the Year for 2015, reflective of the work that she did in 2014.

3012
03:33:27,602 --> 03:33:33,265
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been brought forward by the Massachusetts Tree Wardens and Forestry Association, which is a statewide professional organization.

3013
03:33:33,785 --> 03:33:37,766
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'd like to congratulate Aggie on being recognized by her peers as a leader in the industry.

3014
03:33:38,086 --> 03:33:44,749
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to thank her for her hard work here in the city of Medford and invite her down for a city council citation, provided that my colleagues so support the idea.

3015
03:33:45,743 --> 03:33:46,863
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

3016
03:33:46,903 --> 03:33:49,965
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion approved by Councilor Knight, all those in favor?

3017
03:33:50,305 --> 03:33:52,106
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

3018
03:33:52,706 --> 03:33:54,126
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

3019
03:33:54,266 --> 03:33:57,648
[SPEAKER_14]: Item 15-014 offered under suspension by Councilor Knight.

3020
03:33:58,088 --> 03:34:14,695
[SPEAKER_14]: Be it resolved that an audit be performed on all taxicab companies licensed to operate in the City of Medford to verify and ensure compliance with the ordinances of the City of Medford that govern such operation.

3021
03:34:14,815 --> 03:34:15,535
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight.

3022
03:34:16,435 --> 03:34:17,736
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

3023
03:34:17,756 --> 03:34:27,322
[SPEAKER_11]: I had previously brought this resolution forward the night of torrential rains when Councilor Mox was unfortunately taken away from us due to a flooding issue at his home.

3024
03:34:28,002 --> 03:34:33,925
[SPEAKER_11]: And I brought the resolution forward because we had recently had a licensing committee meeting to discuss the fees for taxicab companies.

3025
03:34:34,366 --> 03:34:36,107
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of other issues had come up in that meeting.

3026
03:34:37,488 --> 03:34:43,211
[SPEAKER_11]: We see a number of individuals petition this council for taxicab licenses and license to operate taxis.

3027
03:34:43,653 --> 03:34:45,113
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's a lot of concern about that.

3028
03:34:45,394 --> 03:34:51,635
[SPEAKER_11]: There are several councilors that refrain from voting in certain instances until there's a new ordinance in place.

3029
03:34:51,955 --> 03:34:54,816
[SPEAKER_11]: The city clerk has worked very hard on putting together a new ordinance.

3030
03:34:55,196 --> 03:34:59,757
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's time that maybe we take a look at what areas of noncompliance are in place right now.

3031
03:34:59,817 --> 03:35:04,039
[SPEAKER_11]: So if in fact we are serious about moving forward and creating a new ordinance, we know where to start.

3032
03:35:04,079 --> 03:35:08,800
[SPEAKER_11]: We know where the number one offenders are, we know where the number one problems lay, and we know what we can do to fix it.

3033
03:35:09,362 --> 03:35:12,163
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Counselor Knight, on the motion of approval by Counselor Knight.

3034
03:35:12,523 --> 03:35:13,324
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

3035
03:35:13,624 --> 03:35:14,464
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

3036
03:35:14,564 --> 03:35:16,825
[SPEAKER_14]: The motion passes.

3037
03:35:17,745 --> 03:35:20,226
[SPEAKER_14]: Papers in the hand of the clerk.

3038
03:35:22,988 --> 03:35:25,149
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion to go on to suspension by Counselor Penta.

3039
03:35:28,270 --> 03:35:28,870
[SPEAKER_14]: I got it right here.

3040
03:35:30,891 --> 03:35:31,711
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

3041
03:35:31,751 --> 03:35:32,472
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

3042
03:35:33,172 --> 03:35:38,214
[SPEAKER_14]: On to suspension to take papers from the clerk offered by Counselor Caraviello.

3043
03:35:39,256 --> 03:35:46,662
[SPEAKER_14]: please offer condolences to the family of former Medford school teacher and coach, Jack Downs.

3044
03:35:47,122 --> 03:35:48,243
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Caravaglio.

3045
03:35:48,763 --> 03:35:49,844
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3046
03:35:50,165 --> 03:35:51,746
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Downs passed away this weekend.

3047
03:35:52,706 --> 03:35:54,608
[SPEAKER_16]: He was a golf coach at the school.

3048
03:35:55,529 --> 03:35:58,471
[SPEAKER_16]: He's a teacher.

3049
03:35:59,972 --> 03:36:02,294
[SPEAKER_16]: He's since moved out of Medford and moved into Estonia.

3050
03:36:02,314 --> 03:36:06,577
[SPEAKER_16]: But I'll say he was a good member of this community for many years, and there's one I wish his family condolences.

3051
03:36:07,057 --> 03:36:07,877
[SPEAKER_14]: May he rest in peace.

3052
03:36:07,977 --> 03:36:09,358
[SPEAKER_14]: Please rise for a moment of silence.

3053
03:36:20,022 --> 03:36:28,326
[SPEAKER_14]: Offered by Councilor Marks, be it resolved that the Staffenshaw parking lot located on Salem Street be discussed.

3054
03:36:28,846 --> 03:36:29,566
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Marks.

3055
03:36:30,086 --> 03:36:31,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3056
03:36:31,307 --> 03:36:33,748
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a call from a resident of the Salem Street area.

3057
03:36:34,655 --> 03:36:51,385
[SPEAKER_04]: And she wrote a letter to the owners of that particular business area where the stop and shop is on Salem Street and was told, her concern was regarding the condition of the lot out there.

3058
03:36:51,405 --> 03:36:53,346
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in deplorable condition.

3059
03:36:54,187 --> 03:36:57,789
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a blighted area, that particular lot.

3060
03:36:58,449 --> 03:37:03,192
[SPEAKER_04]: And she was told by the business owner that they are going to be repaving

3061
03:37:04,003 --> 03:37:05,224
[SPEAKER_04]: that whole particular lot.

3062
03:37:05,844 --> 03:37:13,987
[SPEAKER_04]: And she mentioned to the owner, is it possible to plant some shrubs and bushes and something to spruce up the area?

3063
03:37:14,807 --> 03:37:19,349
[SPEAKER_04]: And at that point, they said they had no plans to do so.

3064
03:37:19,909 --> 03:37:30,853
[SPEAKER_04]: So at this point, Mr. President, I would ask that this council send a letter to the property owner of the stop and shop and that parcel of stores there.

3065
03:37:31,552 --> 03:37:44,478
[SPEAKER_04]: asking that when the lot get repaved, that pavers go around the perimeter of the lot, that shrubs be planted, some small fruit trees, anything to spruce up that particular area.

3066
03:37:45,159 --> 03:37:47,140
[SPEAKER_04]: There's an 18-wheeler that parks in there.

3067
03:37:47,460 --> 03:37:50,141
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a giant tow truck that parks at the corner over there.

3068
03:37:50,661 --> 03:37:56,244
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's the gateway from Malden and that area to come into Method, and it's really an eyesore.

3069
03:37:56,751 --> 03:38:06,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Across the street, you have a Chinese food restaurant that had a fire, I think it was about a year ago, and it's still boarded up with big action signs all over it.

3070
03:38:07,196 --> 03:38:15,000
[SPEAKER_04]: It really looks like an area that's downtrodden and hasn't had any attention in a long time, Mr. President.

3071
03:38:15,621 --> 03:38:20,703
[SPEAKER_04]: And residents of that particular area are very upset with the lack of attention.

3072
03:38:21,384 --> 03:38:23,605
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm hoping that a letter from this council

3073
03:38:23,958 --> 03:38:26,920
[SPEAKER_04]: will at least help spruce up the stop and shopping area.

3074
03:38:27,300 --> 03:38:32,963
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe we can get the office of community development rather than build a peace garden.

3075
03:38:33,504 --> 03:38:34,484
[SPEAKER_04]: That's unnecessary.

3076
03:38:34,804 --> 03:38:38,827
[SPEAKER_04]: In my opinion, at a million three to go into our neighborhoods.

3077
03:38:39,607 --> 03:38:46,549
[SPEAKER_04]: and look at the awnings, and look at the businesses that have been out of business for a year because of a fire, and see what's going on.

3078
03:38:47,070 --> 03:38:52,452
[SPEAKER_04]: See what's happening on Forest Street, the business on Forest Street that's been vacant for years, Mr. President.

3079
03:38:52,972 --> 03:38:57,993
[SPEAKER_04]: The Office of Community Development should be providing incentives for businesses to come into this community.

3080
03:38:58,274 --> 03:39:03,315
[SPEAKER_04]: The ones that are already here should be providing incentives to stay here and do business, Mr. President.

3081
03:39:03,595 --> 03:39:07,577
[SPEAKER_04]: And in my opinion, an office that's manned with one and a half persons

3082
03:39:08,057 --> 03:39:18,222
[SPEAKER_04]: It's inadequate in a city this size, and it's evident in every business district in this community with the lack of attention and the lack of development in this community, Mr. President.

3083
03:39:18,542 --> 03:39:23,024
[SPEAKER_04]: And it comes from the corner office on down to the department head, Mr. President.

3084
03:39:23,345 --> 03:39:28,287
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a shame when you have a department that does absolutely nothing, Mr. President.

3085
03:39:29,028 --> 03:39:32,190
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll say it when Lauren DiLorenzo pop is up here too, Mr. President.

3086
03:39:32,610 --> 03:39:36,552
[SPEAKER_04]: That office does absolutely nothing to move this community forward.

3087
03:39:36,812 --> 03:39:45,317
[SPEAKER_04]: They've been working on the revitalization of Meffitt Square three master plans later, 25 years later, and this administration is still talking about

3088
03:39:45,657 --> 03:39:49,699
[SPEAKER_04]: the master plan in Meffitt Square, the pearl necklace around the river.

3089
03:39:49,979 --> 03:39:51,780
[SPEAKER_04]: He's still talking about a water taxi.

3090
03:39:51,980 --> 03:39:53,660
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes no sense, Mr. President.

3091
03:39:53,980 --> 03:39:57,522
[SPEAKER_04]: But when he goes into the business districts, he doesn't see the vacant storefronts.

3092
03:39:57,762 --> 03:40:00,743
[SPEAKER_04]: He doesn't see the trash strewn throughout the squares.

3093
03:40:01,003 --> 03:40:02,844
[SPEAKER_04]: He doesn't see any of that, Mr. President.

3094
03:40:03,264 --> 03:40:07,186
[SPEAKER_04]: It's amazing the blinders that this administration has on.

3095
03:40:07,606 --> 03:40:08,907
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's time for a change.

3096
03:40:09,167 --> 03:40:10,227
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Counselor Marks.

3097
03:40:10,307 --> 03:40:11,368
[SPEAKER_16]: Counselor Caraviello.

3098
03:40:12,728 --> 03:40:13,388
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3099
03:40:13,428 --> 03:40:15,009
[SPEAKER_16]: I agree with Counselor Marks 100 percent.

3100
03:40:16,013 --> 03:40:22,036
[SPEAKER_16]: If I can recall, I think we made a motion a year ago about the tow truck that's been there as long as I can remember.

3101
03:40:22,516 --> 03:40:25,718
[SPEAKER_16]: But he's right, the parking lot, it's always been in deplorable shape.

3102
03:40:26,078 --> 03:40:28,639
[SPEAKER_16]: They never, who actually owns that property?

3103
03:40:30,480 --> 03:40:32,961
[SPEAKER_16]: If we could find out who actually owns that property, I mean.

3104
03:40:35,362 --> 03:40:36,602
[SPEAKER_16]: We're stopping shoppers and sales.

3105
03:40:36,663 --> 03:40:37,523
[SPEAKER_16]: Mike's Jim.

3106
03:40:37,943 --> 03:40:42,125
[SPEAKER_14]: That was Johnny's food master and turned stopper years ago.

3107
03:40:42,775 --> 03:40:50,737
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's see, but he's right, the parking lot has been in deplorable shape for many years, and there's no reason why that tow truck should be there every single day and night of the week.

3108
03:40:51,397 --> 03:40:59,979
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's like, that's right, you're right, there is no commercial parking every night, but again, they're parking on private property and no one says anything.

3109
03:41:00,259 --> 03:41:04,559
[SPEAKER_16]: But, and also, those stores have been burnt out for, I think it's going on two years now.

3110
03:41:05,380 --> 03:41:07,100
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a tremendous eyesore on the community.

3111
03:41:08,300 --> 03:41:10,781
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's see, it's been close to two years and nothing's happened there.

3112
03:41:12,427 --> 03:41:19,968
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know why nothing's happened, but why isn't the landlord of that building at least either tear the building down and put up a new one or open something up there?

3113
03:41:19,988 --> 03:41:21,569
[SPEAKER_04]: The city's doing nothing.

3114
03:41:21,629 --> 03:41:24,189
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure we're not.

3115
03:41:24,969 --> 03:41:28,790
[SPEAKER_16]: We have no enforcement officer to enforce all these ordinances that we have.

3116
03:41:31,610 --> 03:41:33,151
[SPEAKER_16]: Point of information, Councilor Marks.

3117
03:41:33,511 --> 03:41:33,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Good point.

3118
03:41:33,971 --> 03:41:40,792
[SPEAKER_04]: What about the clean it or lean it ordinance that was enacted some years ago by then representative Paul Donato?

3119
03:41:41,601 --> 03:41:44,963
[SPEAKER_04]: How can you have an establishment there two years with action signs?

3120
03:41:45,784 --> 03:41:47,485
[SPEAKER_04]: What does that do for the surrounding businesses?

3121
03:41:47,525 --> 03:41:53,148
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you like to own a restaurant, like the Italian restaurant that's a few doors down next to this particular place?

3122
03:41:54,489 --> 03:41:57,531
[SPEAKER_04]: God knows what's inside that place after two years of being vacant.

3123
03:41:57,931 --> 03:42:04,796
[SPEAKER_14]: Could we perhaps amend your motion to include a notification to the code enforcement officer?

3124
03:42:04,856 --> 03:42:06,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Does the mayor ever drive by these areas?

3125
03:42:10,055 --> 03:42:12,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, does he ever drive by and see what's going on in this city?

3126
03:42:13,407 --> 03:42:14,628
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't understand, Mr. President.

3127
03:42:14,928 --> 03:42:19,671
[SPEAKER_04]: Residents have to make calls, personal calls and e-mails to business owners to ask them to do stuff.

3128
03:42:20,032 --> 03:42:21,232
[SPEAKER_04]: And the business owners say, you know what?

3129
03:42:21,472 --> 03:42:24,134
[SPEAKER_04]: The city has never reached out to us once since we've been here.

3130
03:42:24,394 --> 03:42:25,295
[SPEAKER_14]: You've made your point.

3131
03:42:25,515 --> 03:42:26,076
[SPEAKER_14]: And, Counselor?

3132
03:42:26,116 --> 03:42:27,036
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, loud and clear.

3133
03:42:27,477 --> 03:42:28,757
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

3134
03:42:28,878 --> 03:42:31,099
[SPEAKER_11]: And thank you, Counselor Marks, for bringing this resolution forward.

3135
03:42:31,499 --> 03:42:35,922
[SPEAKER_11]: I think if, in fact, we're going to send code enforcement down there, it may also make sense to send the Board of Health down there.

3136
03:42:36,683 --> 03:42:37,984
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a vacant building boarded up.

3137
03:42:38,024 --> 03:42:42,507
[SPEAKER_11]: Who knows what rodents are inside or what else for that matter, Mr. President.

3138
03:42:43,015 --> 03:42:47,037
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd ask that if in fact we are going to send somebody down there to take a look at the property that we also include the Board of Health.

3139
03:42:47,897 --> 03:42:51,739
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of approval by Councilor Marks, amended by Councilors Marks and Knight.

3140
03:42:52,159 --> 03:42:53,040
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

3141
03:42:53,800 --> 03:42:54,660
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

3142
03:42:54,680 --> 03:42:56,921
[SPEAKER_14]: The motion passes.

3143
03:42:57,202 --> 03:42:58,742
[SPEAKER_14]: Offered by Councilor Penta.

3144
03:42:59,683 --> 03:43:07,546
[SPEAKER_14]: Be it resolved that in light of the recently enacted NSTAR's 30% electric rate increase and now a 37% electric rate increase,

3145
03:43:11,275 --> 03:43:36,385
[SPEAKER_14]: And now with their NSTAR proposed gas rate increase of an average of $11.95 per month, we, the city council, vote to forward to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities our displeasure on behalf of our Medford citizens to such a proposed rate increase, knowing that NSTAR is the monopoly of both our gas and electric service.

3146
03:43:37,305 --> 03:43:40,006
[SPEAKER_14]: It is with disadvantage that we,

3147
03:43:42,380 --> 03:43:49,326
[SPEAKER_14]: as a city of customers are subject to these back-to-back rate increases.

3148
03:43:49,906 --> 03:44:06,800
[SPEAKER_14]: Be it further resolved that a copy of this vote be forwarded to Mark DiMarini, Secretary, State Department of Public Utilities, 1 South Station, 5th floor, Boston, Mass, 02110, Councillor Penta.

3149
03:44:07,100 --> 03:44:10,183
[SPEAKER_05]: This was a notice sent out from the Department of Public Utilities

3150
03:44:11,028 --> 03:44:13,209
[SPEAKER_05]: for a hearing that's going to be forthcoming in January.

3151
03:44:13,710 --> 03:44:15,351
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's a whole other bunch of locations.

3152
03:44:15,371 --> 03:44:21,974
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to be in Worcester, and Dedham, and Keith Middle School, and New Bedford, Plymouth, and then one in Boston.

3153
03:44:22,935 --> 03:44:27,157
[SPEAKER_05]: The rate increase of 37% I think we've all felt it in our electric bills.

3154
03:44:27,978 --> 03:44:39,624
[SPEAKER_05]: And the gas company basically gets their money or their proposals that are associated with the sale of the company's appliance business and their operation of home heating protection plans.

3155
03:44:40,895 --> 03:44:41,736
[SPEAKER_05]: It goes like this.

3156
03:44:42,557 --> 03:44:49,262
[SPEAKER_05]: During the winter months, if you use 160 therms of gas per month, your bill will increase by $25.90, which will be a 13.1% increase.

3157
03:44:49,282 --> 03:44:54,066
[SPEAKER_05]: And then during the summer months, if you use more than 31 therms a month, your bill will increase by $8.38, which is a 19.6% increase.

3158
03:45:09,098 --> 03:45:10,158
[SPEAKER_05]: The 8% was wrong.

3159
03:45:12,219 --> 03:45:13,079
[SPEAKER_05]: It's wrong.

3160
03:45:13,159 --> 03:45:13,839
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more than that.

3161
03:45:14,460 --> 03:45:21,782
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess between, unfortunately, I took the increase from the summer months rather than the winter, put it together.

3162
03:45:22,042 --> 03:45:23,083
[SPEAKER_05]: The fact of the matter is this.

3163
03:45:23,423 --> 03:45:24,703
[SPEAKER_05]: The rate increase is going to go up.

3164
03:45:24,963 --> 03:45:28,745
[SPEAKER_05]: In your winter bill, it's going to go up by a minimum of $25.90 a month.

3165
03:45:29,205 --> 03:45:32,506
[SPEAKER_05]: And in the summer, it's going to go up by a minimum of $8.38 a month.

3166
03:45:32,986 --> 03:45:37,248
[SPEAKER_05]: And on top of the 37% that you're being charged for the electric bill, it's just crazy.

3167
03:45:37,716 --> 03:45:47,959
[SPEAKER_05]: As I said before, when we were talking about these electric rates, the top administrators from the president town received in excess of $1 million bonuses while they were enacting these rate increases.

3168
03:45:48,139 --> 03:45:49,560
[SPEAKER_05]: We have no choice over this.

3169
03:45:50,260 --> 03:45:53,701
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a monopoly that NSTAR seems to have over our gas and electric bills.

3170
03:45:54,321 --> 03:46:05,165
[SPEAKER_05]: And the only one way to stop this is if cities and towns just respond back to Mr. Marini, the secretary, so he would have that in front of him before the State Department of Public Utilities makes their

3171
03:46:06,123 --> 03:46:06,903
[SPEAKER_05]: final decision.

3172
03:46:07,443 --> 03:46:16,906
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would hope that our state legislature would likewise be on board with this because, you know, people are just getting taxed and taxed and taxed and more taxed to death.

3173
03:46:17,546 --> 03:46:32,670
[SPEAKER_05]: And here's a situation where there are two companies, gas and electric, where the people who run it are just making hundreds of thousands of dollars in their salaries over and beyond that for which people are struggling just to stay alive.

3174
03:46:34,793 --> 03:46:44,420
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of a shame, too, at the conclusion of a administration that this sort of rolled out as someone was walking down the statehouse stairs.

3175
03:46:44,721 --> 03:46:44,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

3176
03:46:45,301 --> 03:46:45,821
[SPEAKER_05]: He rolled out.

3177
03:46:46,002 --> 03:46:46,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

3178
03:46:46,602 --> 03:46:47,923
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll tell you one thing about this governor.

3179
03:46:47,943 --> 03:46:56,670
[SPEAKER_05]: The first day in office, what he did is he took $100 million that the then-governor, Patrick, wouldn't do, and he put it back into road and bridges in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

3180
03:46:56,990 --> 03:46:57,750
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's a big plus.

3181
03:46:58,231 --> 03:47:01,814
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's keeping his commitment to local aid, which is something that Patrick wouldn't do.

3182
03:47:02,094 --> 03:47:03,695
[SPEAKER_05]: So those are two big pluses right now.

3183
03:47:04,130 --> 03:47:04,950
[SPEAKER_05]: for cities and towns.

3184
03:47:05,090 --> 03:47:09,732
[SPEAKER_14]: Hire and freeze and a performance evaluation for all the departments.

3185
03:47:09,792 --> 03:47:09,972
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep.

3186
03:47:10,473 --> 03:47:11,073
[SPEAKER_14]: Excellent.

3187
03:47:12,253 --> 03:47:12,894
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Citizen.

3188
03:47:14,574 --> 03:47:15,575
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3189
03:47:15,615 --> 03:47:17,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Bob Capucci, 71 Evans street.

3190
03:47:18,176 --> 03:47:25,599
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, I don't know what good it would do, but just to expand a little bit on the excellent effort that council append is trying to make, and he brings a very good point.

3191
03:47:26,099 --> 03:47:32,582
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, during the other discussion tonight, we've heard the one business owner talking about the rise of price and food and everything else.

3192
03:47:33,020 --> 03:47:34,321
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is a great initiative.

3193
03:47:34,421 --> 03:47:37,883
[SPEAKER_06]: Soon, our representatives up in Washington, D.C.

3194
03:47:37,923 --> 03:47:43,607
[SPEAKER_06]: are going to be voting on the Keystone Pipeline and other things.

3195
03:47:44,087 --> 03:47:51,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, our representation in Washington, probably across the borders, is going to vote against it, but this is a way to

3196
03:47:51,736 --> 03:47:53,897
[SPEAKER_06]: help alleviate costs right here in Medford.

3197
03:47:54,117 --> 03:48:20,668
[SPEAKER_06]: If we could maybe further the letter to our two state senators, our Congresswoman, was it Catherine Clark, to maybe support expansion of energy deciphering and drilling and pipelines that are gonna come so that these costs, I mean, that's where these increases are coming from, Councilor Pinter.

3198
03:48:21,042 --> 03:48:22,763
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the denial of pipelines.

3199
03:48:22,843 --> 03:48:27,384
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the denial of permits for oil drilling because it's killing jobs and everything else.

3200
03:48:28,024 --> 03:48:42,069
[SPEAKER_06]: We have been getting a break on our gas prices because of the oil war that's going on now between fracking states and the Middle East lowering their prices to try to hurt.

3201
03:48:42,389 --> 03:48:46,190
[SPEAKER_06]: And it is hurting jobs already in North Dakota.

3202
03:48:47,445 --> 03:48:48,986
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to bottom out pretty soon.

3203
03:48:49,266 --> 03:48:51,987
[SPEAKER_06]: And Councillor Pinto brings up an excellent point.

3204
03:48:52,647 --> 03:49:06,714
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope that we could maybe as a City Council send something to our Washington representatives and any citizens at home watching, maybe we can call some of our Washington representatives because these issues are going to be coming up in the new Congress.

3205
03:49:06,814 --> 03:49:12,897
[SPEAKER_06]: And I hope that the right decisions are made on behalf of the people that vote.

3206
03:49:13,466 --> 03:49:18,368
[SPEAKER_06]: you good folks in our state and our national representation into office.

3207
03:49:18,448 --> 03:49:18,788
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

3208
03:49:19,408 --> 03:49:26,070
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. Capucci on the motion of for approval by counselor night, counselor night.

3209
03:49:26,410 --> 03:49:31,252
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I was just wondering if the clerk or the president would be so kind as to read that back one more time.

3210
03:49:31,832 --> 03:49:32,532
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd be delighted.

3211
03:49:34,773 --> 03:49:39,935
[SPEAKER_14]: It's amended by counselor, not counselor.

3212
03:49:43,835 --> 03:49:44,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

3213
03:49:44,495 --> 03:49:44,635
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

3214
03:49:44,796 --> 03:49:45,116
[SPEAKER_05]: Federal.

3215
03:49:45,976 --> 03:49:48,678
[SPEAKER_14]: So if I could, um, may I be seated counselor?

3216
03:49:48,698 --> 03:49:49,618
[SPEAKER_14]: I hope so.

3217
03:49:49,718 --> 03:49:50,118
[SPEAKER_05]: You tired.

3218
03:49:50,138 --> 03:49:50,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.

3219
03:49:52,159 --> 03:49:59,983
[SPEAKER_14]: Offered by counselor Penta be resolved that in light of the recently enacted and start 30% electric rate increase.

3220
03:50:00,464 --> 03:50:12,490
[SPEAKER_14]: And now with their end stock proposed gas rate increase of an average of $11 and 95 cents per month, we, the Medford city council vote to forward to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts

3221
03:50:13,015 --> 03:50:20,238
[SPEAKER_14]: Department of Public Utilities, our displeasure on behalf of our Medford citizens to such a proposed rate increase.

3222
03:50:20,918 --> 03:50:34,204
[SPEAKER_14]: Knowing that NSTAR is the monopoly of both our gas and electric service, it is with disadvantage that we, as a city of customers, are subject to these back-to-back rate increases.

3223
03:50:34,844 --> 03:50:41,447
[SPEAKER_14]: Be it further resolved that a copy of this vote be forwarded to Mark DiMarini, Secretary, State,

3224
03:50:41,857 --> 03:50:48,459
[SPEAKER_14]: Department of Public Utilities, 1 South Station, 5th Floor, Boston Mass, 02110.

3225
03:50:49,019 --> 03:50:52,539
[SPEAKER_14]: It's amended to send this to our Washington delegation as well.

3226
03:50:52,900 --> 03:50:53,640
[SPEAKER_14]: Counselor Knight.

3227
03:50:56,120 --> 03:51:03,682
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, I certainly support the resolution in theory, in substance, pretty much except for

3228
03:51:05,131 --> 03:51:08,593
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't like the tone that it sets forth, saying, knowing that NSTAR is the monopoly.

3229
03:51:08,613 --> 03:51:11,195
[SPEAKER_11]: It just seems like it's very argumentative, though.

3230
03:51:11,215 --> 03:51:25,526
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think if we're going to be going to these people and asking them to work with us and to maybe provide us with a little bit more information, or to come into our community and repair our streets the way that they're supposed to be repaired, or coming before us and asking for permits, that we have a good, strong working relationship with them, Mr. President.

3231
03:51:25,827 --> 03:51:29,269
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, I don't disagree saying that NSTAR is the monopoly.

3232
03:51:29,289 --> 03:51:33,873
[SPEAKER_11]: I just think that the tone, if we're going to send this to our federal delegation, has to show a little bit more respect, Mr. President.

3233
03:51:34,452 --> 03:51:40,994
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd be willing to support the resolution provided that the knowing the N star is a monopoly language was stricken from the resolution.

3234
03:51:41,174 --> 03:51:46,475
[SPEAKER_11]: If not, I'd just like to be recorded in opposition as supporting the resolution in theory, but not based upon the language submitted.

3235
03:51:47,296 --> 03:51:47,836
[SPEAKER_11]: Councillor Knight.

3236
03:51:50,797 --> 03:51:50,937
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

3237
03:51:53,017 --> 03:51:56,338
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion for approval as amended, all those in favour?

3238
03:51:56,358 --> 03:51:56,778
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, no.

3239
03:51:56,878 --> 03:51:57,818
[SPEAKER_05]: I want the original motion.

3240
03:51:58,319 --> 03:51:59,279
[SPEAKER_14]: To send it to the federal government?

3241
03:51:59,379 --> 03:51:59,559
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

3242
03:51:59,859 --> 03:52:00,539
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't want it to go there?

3243
03:52:01,059 --> 03:52:01,960
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I do want it to go there.

3244
03:52:01,980 --> 03:52:02,580
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the amendment.

3245
03:52:02,600 --> 03:52:03,320
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the amendment.

3246
03:52:03,977 --> 03:52:04,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

3247
03:52:04,277 --> 03:52:05,037
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the main motion.

3248
03:52:05,818 --> 03:52:06,418
[SPEAKER_11]: The motion is amended.

3249
03:52:06,438 --> 03:52:07,198
[SPEAKER_11]: You're not amending it, are you?

3250
03:52:07,218 --> 03:52:08,299
[SPEAKER_11]: He did not have to amend it.

3251
03:52:08,319 --> 03:52:09,739
[SPEAKER_11]: I said if you're willing to strike it, that's great.

3252
03:52:09,759 --> 03:52:10,240
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll vote for it.

3253
03:52:10,260 --> 03:52:12,681
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're not willing to strike it, then I'd just like to be recorded in the opposition.

3254
03:52:12,701 --> 03:52:13,501
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'm not going to strike it.

3255
03:52:13,621 --> 03:52:15,562
[SPEAKER_11]: Supporting it in theory, however, I have a problem with the language.

3256
03:52:16,362 --> 03:52:17,863
[SPEAKER_14]: So the motion as it stood.

3257
03:52:18,183 --> 03:52:18,363
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

3258
03:52:18,643 --> 03:52:21,964
[SPEAKER_14]: With the amendation that it be sent to the Washington delegation.

3259
03:52:21,984 --> 03:52:22,064
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

3260
03:52:22,525 --> 03:52:23,345
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

3261
03:52:23,365 --> 03:52:23,425
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

3262
03:52:23,745 --> 03:52:24,565
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

3263
03:52:25,506 --> 03:52:26,446
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

3264
03:52:26,826 --> 03:52:28,447
[SPEAKER_11]: Ask the clerk that it be recorded in the opposition.

3265
03:52:32,419 --> 03:52:36,665
[SPEAKER_14]: We have that, Councilors Knight and Camuso, recorded in the opposition.

3266
03:52:36,826 --> 03:52:37,887
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm in favor, by the way.

3267
03:52:42,594 --> 03:52:47,815
[SPEAKER_14]: The tabled records of December 16, 2014, were passed to Counselor Knight.

3268
03:52:48,055 --> 03:52:48,456
[SPEAKER_14]: Counselor?

3269
03:52:48,496 --> 03:52:51,176
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to need one more shot at these, Mr. President.

3270
03:52:51,196 --> 03:52:57,478
[SPEAKER_11]: I see a couple of errors that I'm trying to work out based upon the tape that I have at my house, and I'm getting there, but it's going to take me one more week.

3271
03:52:57,898 --> 03:52:58,858
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'd ask that those records be tabled.

3272
03:52:58,878 --> 03:53:00,238
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion to table those records.

3273
03:53:00,358 --> 03:53:01,298
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

3274
03:53:01,458 --> 03:53:02,199
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

3275
03:53:02,259 --> 03:53:03,339
[SPEAKER_14]: Motions records tabled.

3276
03:53:04,019 --> 03:53:06,379
[SPEAKER_14]: The tabled records of December 23, 2014, were passed to

3277
03:53:09,075 --> 03:53:15,477
[SPEAKER_14]: vice president on the motion of approval by council along the current.

3278
03:53:15,517 --> 03:53:17,438
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor, all those opposed.

3279
03:53:17,538 --> 03:53:24,360
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes and the records of January 6, 2015 were passed to council marks.

3280
03:53:24,700 --> 03:53:25,340
[SPEAKER_14]: Counsel marks.

3281
03:53:25,400 --> 03:53:26,700
[SPEAKER_14]: How did you find those records?

3282
03:53:27,641 --> 03:53:32,182
[SPEAKER_04]: I find another Mr. President, uh, paper 15 dash zero zero two.

3283
03:53:33,142 --> 03:53:35,563
[SPEAKER_04]: It is the nomination of the vice president.

3284
03:53:36,675 --> 03:53:43,199
[SPEAKER_04]: And midway through it says six in the affirmative for Frederick N. De La Russo Jr., the president of 2015.

3285
03:53:43,779 --> 03:53:47,621
[SPEAKER_04]: On the vice president.

3286
03:53:48,522 --> 03:53:50,223
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm both president and vice president.

3287
03:53:50,243 --> 03:53:51,424
[SPEAKER_04]: And vice, according to the minutes.

3288
03:53:53,665 --> 03:53:55,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Congratulations.

3289
03:53:55,186 --> 03:53:55,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

3290
03:53:55,906 --> 03:53:57,347
[SPEAKER_24]: You deserve it.

3291
03:53:57,587 --> 03:53:59,368
[SPEAKER_19]: You deserve it.

3292
03:53:59,768 --> 03:54:00,109
[SPEAKER_16]: $4,000 raise.

3293
03:54:00,289 --> 03:54:00,549
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

3294
03:54:03,010 --> 03:54:08,094
[SPEAKER_14]: Those are corrected, and so the corrected minutes are moved for approval, Mr. Councillor.

3295
03:54:08,134 --> 03:54:12,077
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion to approve?

3296
03:54:15,620 --> 03:54:16,761
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion to approve.

3297
03:54:17,041 --> 03:54:19,383
[SPEAKER_14]: The corrected records, all those in favour?

3298
03:54:19,724 --> 03:54:20,404
[SPEAKER_18]: All those opposed?

3299
03:54:20,424 --> 03:54:21,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Councillor Camuso?

3300
03:54:23,367 --> 03:54:28,110
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd like to make a motion to send a letter of congratulations to our Congresswoman, Catherine

3301
03:54:30,652 --> 03:54:36,834
[SPEAKER_18]: appointed an assistant minority whip, and she's moving up pretty quick, right away.

3302
03:54:38,155 --> 03:54:45,177
[SPEAKER_18]: And she did keep her office here in Medford Square, and she does a better job getting her trash out than the previous proprietor.

3303
03:54:47,358 --> 03:54:48,639
[SPEAKER_18]: A motion to Councilor Camuso.

3304
03:54:48,659 --> 03:54:49,359
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favour?

3305
03:54:49,379 --> 03:54:52,040
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

3306
03:54:53,200 --> 03:54:53,860
[SPEAKER_14]: Regarding the heat.

3307
03:54:56,262 --> 03:54:57,843
[SPEAKER_14]: Council Penter, if you have one more?

3308
03:54:57,863 --> 03:55:10,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we got a document here tonight from Mass Development as it relates to Tufts University making a request for $100 million in tax-exempt bonds to do a project.

3309
03:55:11,089 --> 03:55:24,515
[SPEAKER_05]: It says here that they financed Interior to Robinson Hall on the Medford-Sumnerville campus and the Biomedical Research and Public Health Building on the Boston campus, including relocation of the Information Technology Department and the Sterns Wing

3310
03:55:25,141 --> 03:55:34,085
[SPEAKER_05]: and the acquisition of an apartment building located at 119 College Avenue, Somerville, near the Somerville campus, as well as the other routine Capitol level.

3311
03:55:34,606 --> 03:55:46,852
[SPEAKER_05]: I think what's concerning to me is, if I remember correctly, they appeared before the council some time ago looking for, I believe, an easement to cross over a street down on the Somerville line.

3312
03:55:47,252 --> 03:55:54,035
[SPEAKER_05]: There was no mention at the time of their expansion to include buying an apartment building

3313
03:55:54,453 --> 03:55:55,954
[SPEAKER_05]: at 119 College Ave.

3314
03:55:56,354 --> 03:55:59,496
[SPEAKER_05]: So could we get an update on 119 from Tufts?

3315
03:55:59,756 --> 03:56:01,377
[SPEAKER_05]: What is 119 College Ave?

3316
03:56:01,397 --> 03:56:07,580
[SPEAKER_05]: How many students do they intend to put in there?

3317
03:56:07,600 --> 03:56:08,280
[SPEAKER_05]: 119 College Ave.

3318
03:56:09,281 --> 03:56:10,581
[SPEAKER_15]: What's presently there today?

3319
03:56:10,641 --> 03:56:11,842
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I don't know what it says.

3320
03:56:13,323 --> 03:56:14,103
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a combination.

3321
03:56:14,183 --> 03:56:16,264
[SPEAKER_14]: What's their intention for the property?

3322
03:56:16,544 --> 03:56:18,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's on the Medford-Sumner line.

3323
03:56:18,265 --> 03:56:19,186
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just don't know.

3324
03:56:20,426 --> 03:56:22,167
[SPEAKER_05]: We could send that to Bob Arubel's office.

3325
03:56:23,268 --> 03:56:23,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

3326
03:56:24,055 --> 03:56:25,776
[SPEAKER_15]: Does it tell you right there?

3327
03:56:25,856 --> 03:56:39,607
[SPEAKER_05]: No, all it says that the acquisition of an apartment building located at 119 in the Somerville-Metford slash Somerville-Metford-Boston and Grafton campuses, the bonds financing the property acquisition will be used on a taxable basis.

3328
03:56:40,648 --> 03:56:48,273
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that goes to the regional, which is OCD for us.

3329
03:56:50,008 --> 03:56:53,997
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motion of Councilor Penter, all those in favor, all those opposed, motion passes.

3330
03:56:54,639 --> 03:56:56,664
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion to adjourn from Councilor Caviello.

3331
03:56:56,744 --> 03:56:57,947
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor, all those opposed.
