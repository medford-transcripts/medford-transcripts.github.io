    <p>[DiRico]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=583.903s">Good</a>  evening, and welcome to the 2023 Medford Chamber of Commerce Mayoral Debate. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=589.988s">My</a>  name is Rocco DiRico. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=590.969s">I'm</a>  the president of the Medford Chamber of Commerce. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=593.697s">The</a>  Medford Chamber of Commerce provides a unified voice for the business community and for business districts of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=600.565s">Today</a>  the chamber is bigger, better, and stronger than ever. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=604.289s">We</a>  have over 250 members and more than 20 platinum members. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=609.255s">And</a>  every day the chamber fights to preserve, protect, and promote all the businesses of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=616.1s">It</a>  is so great to have this year's debate at the McGlynn School. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=619.863s">I</a>  wanna publicly thank Principal Nick Tucci and Medford Public Schools for hosting this year's debate. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=626.809s">We're</a>  so thankful, they've been wonderful hosts for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=631.853s">Tonight's</a>  debate is also the most accessible debate that we've had of these debates. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=636.376s">It's</a>  being broadcast live on Medford Community Media and YouTube, and a big thank you to Kevin Harrington and his team from Medford Community Media. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=645.452s">It</a>  took a lot of people to put this debate together. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=648.615s">I</a>  want to thank the Government Affairs Committee of the Chamber, Co-Chairs Stephen Pompeo and Dominic Camara, Maury Carroll, Natalie Breen, and Jamie Thompson. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=659.382s">I</a>  also want to thank our Executive Director, Laura O'Neill. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=664.786s">She</a>  is like a one-woman multinational corporation. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=668.389s">She</a>  is our only staff member and runs everything that the Chamber does, so thank you, Laura, for all you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=674.293s">I</a>  also want to thank Laurel Siegel, who helped us promote this debate, and tonight's ushers, Sam Tarabelsi, Justin Lasko, Rosemary Adania, and Christina Del Sol. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=686.157s">Tonight's</a>  debate really would not be possible without all their hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=689.478s">We</a>  are a totally volunteer organization, aside from Laura and all these folks have donated a lot of hours over the last two months to make that happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=698.393s">We're</a>  also thrilled tonight because Jim Morelli from Fox 25 is our moderator. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=704.236s">As</a>  many of you know, Carrie Kavanaugh has moderated this debate in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=709.139s">She</a>  was not available tonight because she's receiving a very prestigious award in Washington, D.C. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=714.282s">But</a>  I want to thank Carrie because she convinced Jim to help us out tonight, so I really appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=719.725s">I</a>  also want to thank offstage Bill O'Keefe, who's going to be our timekeeper for tonight, which is a very stressful job. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=728.174s">And</a>  a big thank you to our panel. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=730.036s">Dan</a>  Kennedy has done this for us a number of times. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=732.719s">Dan</a>  Kennedy is from Northeastern University. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=735.241s">Penny</a>  Outlaw from the DeMock Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=737.504s">Mark</a>  Shanahan of the Boston Globe. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=740.126s">and</a>  Anne-Marie Gallagher of the Medford Historical Society. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=743.288s">We're</a>  so fortunate to have so many of these talented people serving on our panel. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=750.392s">And</a>  I want to make it clear, they are the only people who have seen the questions for tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=755.034s">Nobody</a>  on the board, none of the candidates, nobody has seen the questions that have been submitted except for the panel. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=761.331s">And</a>  of course, I really want to thank both candidates. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=765.512s">I've</a>  known both of these candidates for a very long time, and they are both incredibly dedicated public servants, and I have tremendous respect for both of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=774.675s">It</a>  takes a lot of courage and incredible dedication and time away from your family to run for public office, and I think they're two amazing candidates. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=784.757s">But</a>  I do want to emphasize that the Medford Chamber of Commerce is a nonpartisan organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=790.999s">We</a>  have not and we will not endorse either candidate. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=795.3s">No</a>  member of the Chamber of Commerce has seen any of tonight's questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=799.722s">Neither</a>  candidate has seen any of tonight's questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=803.003s">The</a>  questions that you hear tonight are all questions that were submitted by Medford residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=811.496s">This</a>  debate is for you, the residents of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=815.419s">So</a>  I ask that you please do not boo or cheer for any candidate. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=820.902s">That'll</a>  only take away from your candidate's time. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=824.125s">We're</a>  just hoping for a peaceful civil debate here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=828.307s">And</a>  now I'm gonna introduce Steven Pompeo, who is the co-chair of our Government Affairs Committee, and his grandniece, Cece.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=844.52s">Thank</a>  you, Rocco. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=845.961s">If</a>  you would all please rise as we recite the Pledge of Allegiance, led by Cecilia Pompeo, second grade student at the Brooks School. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=857.711s">I'm</a>  going to have to use this one.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=871.67s">Pledge</a>  allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=889.646s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=891.248s">And</a>  now, Dominic Camara will sing God Bless America.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=896.553s">Join</a>  in. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=897.553s">Three.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=898.825s">2,</a>  1, God bless America, land that I love. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=907.696s">Stand</a>  beside her and guide her through the night with the light from above. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=916.608s">From</a>  the mountains, to the prairies, to the oceans, wide with foam, God bless America, my home sweet home. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=933.632s">God</a>  bless America, my home sweet home.</p>

    <p>[DiRico]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=947.11s">Thank</a>  you so much, Dominic. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=949.551s">And</a>  again, thank you all for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=951.392s">It's</a>  now my great pleasure to introduce Jim Morelli from Fox 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=955.994s">Thank</a>  you, sir.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=957.615s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=962.068s">Before</a>  I bring out the candidates, I just want to let you know I've never done this before. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=966.651s">The</a>  only thing I've ever moderated are arguments between my son and my wife, and they basically usually ignored me. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=972.895s">I</a>  have a high bar from Carrie to try to aspire to. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=976.498s">I</a>  probably won't get quite there. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=978.079s">She</a>  is a Medford native after all. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=980.36s">And</a>  the low bar was given to me last week by the Fox Channel's Republican debate. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=987.181s">I</a>  don't know if anyone saw it, but if you did, you know what I mean. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=990.102s">It</a>  was pretty much a disaster. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=992.502s">Hopefully,</a>  we will rise above that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=994.603s">And</a>  with that, I'd like to introduce our candidates. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=996.763s">The</a>  mayor, Breonna Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1002.264s">And</a>  City Councilor Richard Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1013.763s">I</a>  want to go over the rules here, and the way it's going to work is like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1017.745s">First</a>  of all, the mayor will be giving an opening statement, which means the first question will go to the Councilor, and each candidate will have two minutes to answer, and then candidate A will have a chance to rebuttal, followed by candidate B will also have a chance to rebuttal, and then we'll take turns answering questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1036.533s">and</a>  we'll take turns with our panel as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1039.335s">And</a>  then we will have a lightning round in which each candidate will have 30 seconds to answer questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1045.259s">And</a>  so with that, I'd like to introduce our panel. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1047.681s">Dan.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1050.438s">Thank</a>  you, Jim. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1051.839s">You</a>  know, it's really an honor for me and the rest of our panelists to take part in this debate, and we thank the Medford Chamber of Commerce for organizing it once again. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1061.65s">All</a>  of us have been here before. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1064.893s">I'm</a>  going to skip the introduction because Rocco already did that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1068.797s">We're</a>  all Medford residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1070.459s">I</a>  did want to point that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1073.022s">As</a>  with past debates, we compiled our questions based on suggestions by members of the public who submitted their ideas through an email account that could be accessed only by the four members of the panel. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1085.773s">More</a>  than 60 people responded, and we thank all of them for taking the time to identify the issues that they want the candidates to discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1094.68s">Later,</a>  the panel met and narrowed those suggestions down to a series of full-length questions and some lightning round questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1103.525s">We</a>  also have a few questions in reserve in the unlikely event that we're looking to fill time, so we'll see how that goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1111.83s">So</a>  with that, let's get on with the debate.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1116.973s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1117.674s">Before</a>  we begin, though, I do want to say this. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1120.609s">As</a>  has already been stated, running for office is a huge sacrifice. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1124.831s">I</a>  mean, I am sure you guys have spent many, many late, late, late, late nights away from family. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1129.774s">It's</a>  a lot of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1131.335s">And</a>  this is what basically makes our democracy run, people who are willing to run for office. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1136.517s">So</a>  please keep that in mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1138.238s">Please</a>  keep respect in mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1140.279s">And</a>  be nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1143.493s">First</a>  question goes to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1144.914s">Two</a>  minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1147.135s">Opening.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1148.096s">Opening.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1148.556s">Oh,</a>  I'm so sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1149.416s">Opening.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1149.697s">Go</a>  ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1150.417s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1151.718s">Again,</a>  I just, sorry.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1154.619s">Thank</a>  you to the chamber, to the panelists, to Jim for the opportunity tonight to talk about the issues facing our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1161.383s">My</a>  name is Breanna Lungo-Koehn and I am proud to have served as your mayor since 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1167.205s">I'm</a>  proud to call Medford home, raise my family here, and serve my neighbors first as city councilor and now as your mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1175.548s">I</a>  have led the city with the same values that this community instilled in me. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1179.79s">that</a>  integrity, hard work, and helping the people of Medford come first. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1184.833s">Over</a>  the past three and a half years, we have worked together to deliver key wins for Medford, recovering from the pandemic by delivering the supports to our businesses, schools, neighbors in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1197.319s">We</a>  did a street and sidewalk audit assessment to start working on the backloads <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1201.943s">backlog</a>  of decades of neglect. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1204.485s">We've</a>  developed Medford's first comprehensive multi-year capital improvement plan, including millions of dollars for improvements to our streets, sidewalks, fire stations, schools, parks, tree canopy, and so much more. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1217.497s">We</a>  drafted the first ever master plan to create a 30-year vision for our future. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1223.12s">We</a>  finalized the Climate Action and Adaptation Plan and have been hard at work implementing so we can meet our climate goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1230.705s">We</a>  reworked the city's website and budget process. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1234.588s">We</a>  received the city's first ever Distinguished Budget Award. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1238.711s">We</a>  have completed a housing production plan to help guide us in our work to make Medford more affordable for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1245.215s">We</a>  hired the first Economic Development Director <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1248.497s">and</a>  the city's first facilities maintenance director, and I have built a team that gets things done. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1255.739s">There</a>  is still important work that remains as our city faces great opportunities and tough challenges, which is why I'm running for another term as your mayor of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1265.702s">I'm</a>  looking forward to answering your questions tonight, and I hope to earn your vote on November 7th. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1270.083s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1274.332s">Thank</a>  you, and on behalf of myself, thank you to the panel, thank you to everyone here. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1279.135s">So</a>  I would like to thank the chamber for hosting this debate, for all of you in attendance tonight, and for those of you watching from home. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1285.919s">My</a>  name is Rick Caraviello, and I'm running for mayor out of a genuine love and concern for our city, and I want to help keep Medford to be a great place to live, work, and raise a family. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1297.265s">I</a>  bring a consistent, transparent, and hands-on approach to Medford City government. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1302.088s">Too</a>  many of us know there's a distinct lack of vision coming out of City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1306.291s">Our</a>  economic growth lags behind neighboring communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1309.673s">Our</a>  schools are underperforming and lack proper safety protocols. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1314.096s">Our</a>  roads and sidewalks are in complete disrepair. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1317.299s">Too</a>  many critical positions in City Hall are left unfilled. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1321.422s">Our</a>  public employees are frustrated. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1324.103s">And</a>  our squares need to be reinvigorated. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1326.55s">I'm</a>  a 12-year veteran of the Medford City Council, serving as president for three times. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1331.252s">I</a>  have never been one to seek out the limelight. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1333.813s">I</a>  just get the job done. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1335.954s">As</a>  many of you said along the campaign trail, Rick answers the call. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1339.896s">And</a>  right now, people are calling me from across Medford, calling for new leadership. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1345.287s">One</a>  of my proudest public service accomplishments is bringing a new state-of-the-art public library to the city of Medford, along with being the co-chair of the Medford Public Library Foundation. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1354.811s">Another</a>  accomplishment was partnering with Councilor Marks, Arts Collaborative Medford, and Theory Wellness to deliver a long-awaited arts center that will offer a fresh, safe, and long-awaited center for Medford residents of all ages. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1369.699s">I</a>  understand what we need to move Metro forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1372.16s">And</a>  to do that, we need real leadership in the mayor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1375.442s">And</a>  I am running for mayor for each and every one of you, whether you are a lifetime resident or just chose Metro to be your home now. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1382.885s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1391.969s">And</a>  Dan Kennedy has the first question for Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1395.291s">Two</a>  minutes to answer.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1396.758s">Tonight</a>  we're going to be asking both of you to react to questions about various issues that residents of Medford have shared with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1404.803s">But</a>  we'd like to begin by asking a question that is proactive. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1408.906s">What</a>  will be your number one priority, your single priority as mayor during the next two years, understanding that you'll do more than one thing, but what is number one?</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1420.114s">Number</a>  one priority would be filling vacancies that are in City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1423.816s">We</a>  have no city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1426.482s">We</a>  have no building commissioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1429.464s">We</a>  have a part-time economic development director. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1434.487s">So</a>  those are my first three priorities as soon as I walk into office.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1446.156s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1446.537s">That's</a>  a great question. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1448.358s">First</a>  of all, I think all the work we've been doing is so important, so it's a hard question to answer, but I'll start with answering it with regards to housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1457.766s">I</a>  think we see a crisis in the Commonwealth, and we also see the crisis here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1464.751s">So</a>  what we've been able to do is create a master plan as well as a housing production plan that we are enacting currently and want to continue to enact. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1474.778s">We</a>  work with the council, we got that approved, and we also built in an affordable housing trust, which was also approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1483.143s">That</a>  trust is gonna, we're gonna create a board of members of our city, experts to help create more affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1490.928s">We're</a>  also going to continue to work with our 40B developments. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1494.33s">The</a>  first one we just finalized was Mill Creek. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1497.451s">That</a>  is going to add 350 new units to Medford, 88 of which will be affordable. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1503.715s">We</a>  are going to continue to work with the Medford Housing Authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1506.816s">They</a>  are rehabbing all the units on Riverside Ave, and they are adding 22 additional units. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1512.879s">We've</a>  supported them through the city with helping offset some of their permit costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1517.802s">We</a>  also have the development at Walkland Court. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1521.223s">We</a>  have a hundred additional affordable housing units that will be added and then a rehab for all of our seniors and disabled population to have a quality living situation and to add 122 units. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1534.346s">So</a>  we're going to continue to support the Housing Authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1538.607s">We're</a>  going to continue to bring in development like we have over the last <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1542.888s">several</a>  years. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1543.808s">We</a>  did a lot of planning to get here and right now we have about 10 additional projects bringing in over 185 additional units to create housing in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1554.391s">We</a>  have commissioned a team with MAPC and our planning and development team to redo Medford Square to also bring in new housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1563.994s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1565.615s">Council,</a>  you have one minute to rebut.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1567.655s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1568.395s">So</a>  we talk about housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1571.212s">Why</a>  have we waited three years to get our 240B projects off the ground? <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1576.6s">These</a>  are projects that should have been started three years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1579.725s">They</a>  would have been probably been up now generating taxes and housing families. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1584.312s">So</a>  that's been an issue from day one. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1589.164s">I've</a>  agreed with the mayor, with all the housing authority, I've supported the walking club project, redoing all the 121 Riverside Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1599.569s">So</a>  we do need more housing because Medford is an unaffordable community. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1604.472s">And</a>  we need to do what we need to do to make Medford more affordable by providing more affordable housing.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1612.616s">Mayor,</a>  you have a minute? <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1613.657s">Yes,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1615.376s">When</a>  I came into office January 2020, I had three 40B developments dropped on our table. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1623.299s">So</a>  we commissioned the team led by Director Hunt and myself, as well as help from engineering and other departments, and we created, we assessed our landmass area. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1637.125s">and</a>  we met that threshold. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1638.866s">That</a>  gave us the leverage to push these 40 bees and have a seat at the table so they just didn't come in and do whatever they wanted in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1648.33s">We</a>  made sure that the buildings are sustainable. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1652.132s">We</a>  want updates to walkability around the facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1655.713s">We</a>  want to make sure the residents in those <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1658.395s">complexes</a>  have green space. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1660.457s">By</a>  doing the tough work, we were able to turn what was promised 12-story high-rise luxury apartment complex on Mystic Ave into a $1 billion life science proposal that is before us today. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1672.968s">We</a>  did it right, and I'm proud of it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1677.361s">Any</a>  question for the mayor? <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1679.962s">A</a>  number of residents who contacted us want to know about your approach to property taxes and whether you support a Proposition 2.5 override, either a general override or a debt exclusion to build a new fire station in high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1694.828s">Would</a>  you allow such a question to go to the voters?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1699.03s">Thank</a>  you, Penny. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1700.311s">That's</a>  a great question. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1701.331s">And</a>  we have a lot of needs, as I saw when we came into office, a lot of infrastructure needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1707.053s">So</a>  I think the top priority for me as your mayor is what we've been doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1711.914s">The</a>  school committee and I commissioned a consultant to review Medford High School and to submit a high-quality application to the MSBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1722.157s">We</a>  were 14th in line last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1724.571s">because</a>  of inflation, they only took 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1726.994s">We</a>  resubmitted in April, and we have our fingers crossed in such high hopes that we will get the MSBA loan to fund potentially half of a new construction of a new high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1739.29s">That</a>  would be almost $200 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1740.431s">So</a>  for me, <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1743.775s">We</a>  need to obviously see where our taxpayers are at, but we will need a debt exclusion for a new high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1750.601s">Our</a>  children deserve it, and our faculty deserve it, and it is in deplorable condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1756.525s">We're</a>  working on updates, but it's just not enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1759.648s">So</a>  I do feel that the top priority is a debt exclusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1763.591s">I</a>  also plan, we have a meeting scheduled with the president and vice president of the council, because <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1770.376s">priority</a>  number one for me when I came in was a new fire station. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1774.5s">We</a>  need a new fire station. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1776.042s">I</a>  always planned to go out to Bond and we'd put the debt service on our general fund budget, but the Councilors want to explore debt exclusion for that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1786.992s">My</a>  stance has always been we need to <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1789.875s">to</a>  know where our taxpayers are. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1792.636s">We</a>  need to give them the facts on what it will cost to do those two things and decide if we have the ability to additionally, I know there's a push on the council for additional override for the general fund budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1805.582s">That's</a>  something we need to explore. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1807.202s">I</a>  have people that <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1808.943s">you</a>  know, hate us that we won't do, we won't do it immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1811.485s">And</a>  then we have people calling saying they can't afford food for their table or these high rents. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1816.689s">So</a>  we need to take a approach where the council and the school in the school committee and myself, as well as the residents make those tough, tough decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1826.055s">Councilor,</a>  you have two minutes.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1827.697s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1828.477s">So</a>  the question is, do we support a new high school? <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1831.74s">A</a>  high school is 52 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1833.241s">I'm</a>  the second graduating class out of there. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1835.562s">Um,</a>  I was there last week talking to students, <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1838.59s">And</a>  it looks the same as when I moved in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1841.873s">When</a>  we were on the council with the mayor, in the last 10 years, the state has given us millions of dollars to redo our science labs, our vocational school, and the pool, and different other projects there. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1854.864s">So</a>  with our declining enrollment at Medford High School, which is about 1,100 students, <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1862.068s">I</a>  feel that there's room for improvement there. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1863.872s">I</a>  think we could shut down sections of the building, rehab them properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1870.202s">Because</a>  as I said, there's plenty of room. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1871.963s">The</a>  school was built for four to 5,000 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1874.425s">And</a>  we also have many other priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1875.827s">We</a>  have a crumbling infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1877.148s">We</a>  have a water and sewer system that I think we all agree that's ready to crumble over years in neglect. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1883.793s">We</a>  need roads, we need sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1886.635s">This</a>  city needs a lot of things, and along with our fire station, that's been promised. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1891.279s">So</a>  we have to get out, before we start making decisions for $300 million, I think we need to sit and figure out what our real priorities are.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1900.615s">Mayor,</a>  you have a minute.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1902.436s">I'll</a>  have to unload there. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1904.137s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1906.118s">With</a>  regards to the MSBA loan, I think it's important to point out that if we desperately need that funding and we need to match that funding 50%, and the MSBA doesn't allow us to choose where to put the high school or how to rebuild, they're gonna tell us what belongs in a high school built for 1,200, 1,300 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1926.767s">And</a>  that is a $350 million price tag. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1929.929s">So</a>  we have to be serious about committing to our students, committing to our educators, and get a new high school built the right way, and let the MSBA lead that process. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1941.197s">I'm</a>  very hopeful. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1942.338s">We're</a>  not certain, but I'm very hopeful that we'll be able to be successful in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1945.781s">And</a>  we need leadership that can get the job done. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1949.043s">And</a>  I think I've proven that over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1952.345s">You</a>  know, we talk about infrastructure, our roads, our sidewalks, our trees, we're getting it done. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1957.049s">This</a>  construction season alone, we've done two miles of sidewalk, two miles. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1962.773s">That</a>  doesn't come easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1963.814s">It</a>  comes with hard work, it comes with leadership, and it comes with a team that can get it done. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1968.178s">And</a>  they have been doing a lot of work, our engineers and our Department of Public Works, and we're getting it done. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1974.162s">Councilwoman?</a> </p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1975.684s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1977.025s">The</a>  mayor's right, we have started doing it, but we started doing it now. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1982.11s">Where</a>  have we been the last couple of years when these projects should have been going on? <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1986.433s">So</a>  yes, I agree with you, we're doing it now, and we're doing roads, and we're doing sidewalks, just too little too late.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=1997.16s">May</a>  I just ask a question, Mayor, since we have a little time? <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2002.84s">A</a>  recent rating showed that the proficiency rating of students at Medford High was 41% for math, 62% for reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2012.488s">Will</a>  the new building help that, do you think?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2015.516s">I</a>  think the ratings show what students have gone through with the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2023.719s">And</a>  a lot of that has to do with mental health. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2026.46s">And</a>  to be in a building that's 60 years old that doesn't have the proper AC and ventilation and heating at times can do wonders for students' mental health and create an atmosphere that is more conducive to learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2040.805s">Yes,</a>  I do. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2043.018s">Councilor,</a>  you have any thought on that?</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2044.499s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2047.88s">A</a>  new building will always bring new morale, but the children are taught from the teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2052.682s">Those</a>  are the ones whose morale are low. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2055.023s">Those</a>  are the ones that need the help. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2061.325s">They're</a>  the ones that need the help. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2063.826s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2066.42s">I'd</a>  love to see a new high school built, but I just think we need to bring our teachers in, give them the tools that they need to teach the students what they have to teach them, and they're the ones that'll bring the proficiency up, not a new building.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2083.115s">All</a>  right, please, if you could refrain from cheering, it just takes up time. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2087.978s">Mark,</a>  you have a question for the councilor.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2090.259s">Yeah,</a>  can you, is this working? <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2092.78s">Yeah,</a>  it's working. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2094.361s">So</a>  last December, the city agreed to a new contract with the teachers union after a year of tough negotiations. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2102.165s">The</a>  firefighters union, who I think you may have seen outside, has been without a contract for a few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2110.609s">How</a>  or where do you propose to find the money to pay fair wages and salaries to city employees, union and non-union, at a time of high inflation and limited resources?</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2127.597s">So</a>  a lot of my extra money we get comes from new growth in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2131.518s">We</a>  need to push for new growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2133.199s">We</a>  need building permit fees. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2135.08s">These</a>  are the things, and new taxes, when buildings go up, <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2138.206s">This</a>  is where we get the money to pay the raises. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2141.628s">And</a>  we shouldn't be waiting three years to negotiate contracts, because now we're looking for back pay to pay these people. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2149.011s">And</a>  they're signing contracts today, and next year they're up. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2152.913s">So</a>  we're not gaining any ground at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2155.834s">So</a>  my priority is to sit at the table in the beginning, not let them fester for two and three years, negotiate them soon, and give everybody a fair and equal contract.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2166.779s">Mayor,</a>  two minutes.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2169.192s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2170.196s">I'll</a>  start by saying that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2174.436s">About</a>  a year ago, most of the contracts in the city, in the school side, became due. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2179.979s">And</a>  it was, other than fire, it was the first time we had 20 contracts that we were trying to negotiate. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2187.584s">We</a>  have since settled with our teachers, we've settled with clerical, we've settled with our Department of Public Works, we've settled with our security monitors, we've settled with a whole host of unions, and there are still a few that we're working on. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2204.013s">We've</a>  been going through good-faith negotiations with all of our unions. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2210.156s">A</a>  few were held up due to, once the leadership changed with the Teamsters, we were doing flying with settling contracts, especially over the last couple months. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2220.281s">But</a>  I think the question, Mark, comes down to the very way you approach the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2226.444s">It's</a>  how do you fund what our employees deserve? <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2231.686s">You</a>  know, if you're in the private sector, <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2234.568s">There's</a>  sometimes more money out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2236.95s">When</a>  you're in the city side, you tax to 2.5%, and you have the responsibility of people tugging and pulling from 25 directions, in my case, 25 different departments wanting more, wanting different things in the contract, and I have to be the one to make tough decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2255.766s">I</a>  have to be the one to do a number of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2258.047s">First,</a>  to be fiscally responsible to the people we serve, to treat our employees well, and to be fair to our employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2266.85s">So</a>  I had unions at one time asking for, and it wasn't too far away, 9.1 percent a year, where we only taxed at 2.5 percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2275.693s">So</a>  it's important that we take that collective picture <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2278.954s">And</a>  I know, it's an election season. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2281.675s">I</a>  respect the push that is on me to get additional contracts settled, and all I can say is we're doing it in good faith while trying to be fiscally responsible.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2292.42s">Councilor,</a>  a minute.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2293.46s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2294.261s">Well,</a>  the mayor is the chief negotiator for our city, not KP Law. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2300.203s">The</a>  mayor should be at the table at the meetings negotiating, not an outside law firm. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2305.866s">This</a>  is an issue for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2309.017s">I've</a>  talked to teachers, I've talked to policemen, I've talked to firemen, and I've talked to other different groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2315.06s">They're</a>  tired of no one from the city showing up to represent them with an outside law firm doing the bulk of the negotiations. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2321.943s">I</a>  am the chief negotiator. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2323.464s">If</a>  I am mayor, I will sit there and I will negotiate contracts along with our in-house solicitor.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2331.048s">Mayor,</a>  you have one minute.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2334.987s">I</a>  think I'll respond with a compliment. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2338.708s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello is a very nice guy and I don't think it's in him to say no. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2344.129s">So</a>  negotiation strategies, whether it's sitting at the table every time or sitting in a side room, or sitting in a side room.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2355.372s">Okay,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2359.913s">Please,</a>  don't make my life hard.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2368.356s">You</a>  have about 40 seconds. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2371.581s">I'm</a>  always present. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2372.962s">I</a>  sit usually in a room with my chief of staff, we have our human resource director, and we have an attorney. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2380.653s">In</a>  my case, we choose to have Copeland and Page <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2384.218s">who</a>  have 40 attorneys on staff that are experts in their field. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2388.4s">It's</a>  the reason why you see Medford moving forward at the rapid pace you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2393.603s">They're</a>  helping planning, they're helping engineering, they're helping the police department, they're helping a number of, all of our departments to get things done. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2402.228s">So</a>  I'm doing my best on a strategy to negotiate in good faith. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2407.811s">It</a>  shows because we've been able to settle contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2410.152s">That's</a>  time. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2410.952s">Okay,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2412.653s">Amory</a>  is going to start our lightning round, and this is a 30-second answer each. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2418.577s">And</a>  yes, I've lost track. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2419.917s">Who</a>  does it go to? <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2421.999s">The</a>  mayor?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2422.459s">Oh,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2423.299s">Oh,</a>  I'm not sure, actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2425.821s">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2426.261s">Me?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2426.701s">Well,</a>  we started one, two, three. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2428.182s">I</a>  believe it goes to the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2431.404s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2432.305s">30</a>  seconds, remember.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2433.765s">What</a>  do you think Medford's greatest challenge is?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2439.949s">I've</a>  already spoken about housing, so I think our next greatest challenge is infrastructure, from buildings to streets to equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2452.112s">It's</a>  why we've commissioned a capital improvement plan back in 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2455.113s">It</a>  was complete in 2022, end of 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2456.654s">We</a>  just recently updated that plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2457.814s">It</a>  took a year's time. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2466.136s">200</a>  million in needs and hundreds of projects in queue.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2472.142s">30</a>  seconds. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2473.383s">30</a>  seconds, that's right, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2475.465s">Councilor,</a>  what do you believe is Medford's greatest challenge in 30 seconds?</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2480.009s">Our</a>  greatest challenge is making Medford affordable for families to live in. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2484.352s">As</a>  I said earlier, our housing costs are rising. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2488.676s">interest</a>  rates are rising, and people need to have places to live. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2492.818s">We</a>  have seniors who need to age in place, and they're struggling to decide whether I pay my rent or my house payments, or do I pay taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2503.402s">So</a>  I want our seniors to age in place, and I want new families to be able to come here and live. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2509.464s">And</a>  I also want businesses to move here so their workers can live here also.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2518.425s">You</a>  have both served in elective office in Medford for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2523.132s">What</a>  one city project or issue are you most proud of that you personally affected in a positive way?</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2531.1s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2531.86s">For</a>  me, that's an easy one. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2534.341s">My</a>  proudest accomplishment is bringing the library to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2539.022s">I</a>  worked probably four years back and forth, finally to get them to come here, and they came, and under Mayor Burke, <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2548.065s">She</a>  agreed to sit down and find the funding to get it done. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2552.229s">And</a>  I also am proud that I sit on the library foundation to help raise an additional $6 million to help fund that project. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2560.077s">So</a>  in a sense, in an essence- That's 30 seconds there. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2563.4s">In</a>  an essence, we own that library for almost 50 cents on the dollar, which is a steal. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2568.374s">So</a>  that's my proudest accomplishment.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2569.735s">Mayor,</a>  30 seconds, proudest accomplishment. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2571.636s">Oh,</a>  it's hard to pick one. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2572.857s">I</a>  think back when I was younger, starting a girls hockey team to getting through a global pandemic, creating the plans that need to be put in place to move the city forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2583.348s">We</a>  also have our pride events that we've celebrated the last two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2587.232s">We</a>  have our run Medford events, community aggregation, saving Medford residents a boatload on their bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2594.959s">We've</a>  built a team that gets things done. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2597.282s">We</a>  have work being done on municipal vulnerability preparedness work that I'm very, very proud of.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2602.347s">All</a>  right, Penny, you have a lightning round question?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2609.082s">Many</a>  Medford residents depend on public transportation, and we all know that the MBTA is having massive problems with commuter rail, subways, and buses. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2617.308s">What</a>  improvements will you advocate for? <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2619.63s">The</a>  mayor.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2623.001s">transportation.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2626.622s">Representative</a>  Barber is working to do an environmental study, pushing to do an environmental study to expand the Green Line. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2634.725s">We</a>  also want to make sure that the current Green Line that just opened is moving at a speed that our residents deserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2643.108s">And</a>  if we do need to do upgrades, we need to make sure that we have leadership in place to push the T to not only communicate <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2649.991s">but</a>  to make sure our residents and all commuters are safe.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2657.751s">As</a>  you know, the City of Medford is in the top five or six in what we're assessed for our services. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2664.253s">And</a>  over the years, we've been getting our services cut. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2667.274s">As</a>  many of you take the bus to work every day, you see the elimination of bus lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2672.376s">We</a>  now have a new train station at Medford that almost is working now, but the tracks don't work. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2679.478s">But</a>  the problem with that is <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2681.659s">people</a>  that have disabilities have nowhere to park there. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2684.56s">And</a>  I've asked in the last few weeks to make sure that there's handicap parking for people there.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2689.842s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2690.983s">And</a>  we're going to go back to regular questions now. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2694.184s">Mark,</a>  this one goes to the Councilor and this is again, a two minute response followed by a two minute response.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2703.607s">Can</a>  you hear? <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2704.048s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2704.268s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2704.628s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2705.926s">Bicycles,</a>  vehicles, pedestrians all coexist uneasily in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2714.471s">Unsafe</a>  driving can be a threat to the safety of people whether they're walking in crosswalks or riding their bicycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2723.176s">Is</a>  the city doing enough to improve safety and what can be done to ensure that those who drive in the city do so safely?</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2734.031s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2734.531s">Well,</a>  as many of us know, we've just put in some new bike lanes and bump-outs throughout the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2741.456s">They're</a>  both good and bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2743.718s">They've</a>  helped safety, but they've also caused us to have major traffic problems, especially if you live in the West Medford area, you see the traffic in the morning backing up and down to the tracks, into Winchester and into the square because of the rotary that's there, and people can't get onto Route 16 to get to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2764.371s">So</a>  that's a giant one. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2765.412s">But</a>  I don't think what people don't realize is that part of the problem with that traffic is we have hundreds of thousands of rideshare rides that start in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2775.638s">And</a>  I think the Mayor can attest to this, that we get paid $0.10 for every rideshare that starts in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2781.242s">And</a>  I think last year we had over 300,000 rides that started here. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2785.665s">So</a>  you're putting cars on the road <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2787.779s">with</a>  people that have no idea what this community is about. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2790.061s">They're</a>  driving by, their ways, and they're going through communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2794.364s">You</a>  have Grubhub now. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2795.706s">You've</a>  got Amazon trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2797.587s">So</a>  we have, it isn't so much coming from our people, it's coming from outside sources that are coming to measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2804.212s">So</a>  that's really what we have to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2806.955s">We</a>  could use more police at certain times of the day, helping with traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2812.559s">So,</a>  like I said, we've been doing our bike lanes, and I wish more riders would take advantage of the bike lanes because I don't see many people in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2820.741s">So,</a>  again, I think the biggest problem comes from just too many cars on the road and not necessarily from people from MidFed.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2829.343s">Do</a>  you mind repeating the question, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2831.403s">Oh,</a>  sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2831.823s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2833.024s">Well,</a>  we were just talking about <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2836.775s">Cars,</a>  bikes, pedestrians all trying to share the road and often doing so in a way that is dangerous. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2846.522s">Unsafe</a>  driving is a threat to the people who are walking. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2850.205s">We</a>  get a lot of questions about folks who talk about being panicked about walking downtown and trying to cross the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2859.912s">and</a>  also folks on their bicycles. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2862.054s">And</a>  the question is, is the city doing enough to improve safety and enforcing whatever can be done to ensure that folks drive safely?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2874.807s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2875.107s">I</a>  think I agree with the Councilor with regards to trying to get cars off the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2880.152s">Not</a>  only is it going to make things safer, but it's going to help with our climate change issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2886.238s">What</a>  we have in place, and I cannot take credit, is Director Todd Blake. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2890.343s">He's</a>  Director of Traffic and Transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2892.885s">And</a>  the work he does on a day-to-day basis for the last five years is <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2898.43s">something</a>  you can't even write about. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2900.291s">There</a>  are 730 streets in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2903.071s">There</a>  are 16 intersections. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2905.112s">Since</a>  he's been here, we've updated, with safety improvements, 200 of those intersections. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2911.253s">So</a>  as you can see, there's a lot done, but there's a lot more to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2914.674s">We</a>  also have been working very hard to create alternate means of transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2920.395s">Not</a>  only do we have the Green Line that opened, but we have implemented <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2924.597s">10</a>  blue bike stations throughout our community and more to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2929.301s">I</a>  know Tufts University, I'll give them a shout out, is dedicating, they're gonna donate two to the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2936.747s">We</a>  also are exploring any and every location for EV charging stations to try to push people to drive hybrid. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2945.294s">We're</a>  trying to electrify our vehicles as well as a way to help with the climate change issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2952.72s">But</a>  transportation, we have drivers, we have walkers, we have people in wheelchairs, people trying to get to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2963.007s">So</a>  there's a balance. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2964.328s">And</a>  I think our traffic commission is doing the best they can to, through Director Blake's advisement, to make sure we accommodate, you know, some parking, but then also make sure we have travel lanes for all means of transportation so that people can get safely to and from work. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2982.421s">and</a>  we've been doing that work for a long time and we need to continue that work. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2986.346s">So</a>  you'll see Winthrop Street, South Street, Main Street, Mystic Ave, we have Haines Square, two complete street projects that we're doing, Haines Square and Riverside Ave, and the work's not done.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2998.281s">Councilor,</a>  one minute.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=2999.542s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3001.718s">your</a>  streets can never be safe enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3003.539s">There's</a>  no, there's really no magic cure to get them done. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3007.081s">Um,</a>  we, we have a traffic engineer who needs to look at our, our traffic causing things as we've caused now, because what's happening is people are sitting in traffic, they're being frustrated and now they're going on to our side streets and which makes it even more dangerous. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3022.811s">And</a>  so our side streets are becoming cutthroats, uh, where people, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3027.774s">are</a>  walking to school, and cars are racing through the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3031.076s">So</a>  I think we really need to figure out ways of fixing our traffic, along with getting people to use alternative means of transportation, bicycles, walkers, and things like that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3047.247s">Mayor,</a>  one minute for you? <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3049.368s">No,</a>  no follow-up. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3051.029s">Good.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3053.071s">Anne</a>  Marie?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3056.48s">What</a>  to do about Medford Square is a perennial question. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3059.921s">The</a>  Chevalier Theatre and Deep Cuts have brought music and entertainment to the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3063.483s">And</a>  there are several good restaurants, including a new one people know as El Tecuba, finally open. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3070.746s">But</a>  the square can be hard to get around, and business development isn't ideal. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3075.608s">What</a>  is your vision for Medford Square, and what sort of deadline would you put on that in order to make it happen?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3082.399s">Mayor,</a>  I think that goes for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3083.68s">It's</a>  me? <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3085.04s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3085.4s">Medford</a>  Square has been talked about for many, many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3087.822s">We've</a>  had a number of studies done, and I feel like the last study, which took into account what was done in 2017, was that that was done by our planning department. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3097.346s">We've</a>  partnered with the MAPC, Mass Development, to reimagine our downtown. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3104.589s">We</a>  have three parcels. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3106.97s">in</a>  Medford Square that we are gonna go out to bid with an RFP on. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3111.835s">Now</a>  that's after months and months long of communication, surveying, community meetings, listening sessions with all of our residents, especially our seniors at the senior center who have needs, as well as the Chevalier Theater, because it just needs to be done right. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3127.869s">So</a>  my vision is multi-use on two of those properties, <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3132.473s">I</a>  would like to see affordability on housing at all different levels on at least one of the properties, commercial on the bottom floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3140.535s">Then</a>  you have the parcel, which is in between the Hyatt and City Hall, where we could create some parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3146.777s">We</a>  could create potentially a rec center. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3148.797s">I'd</a>  love to see a nice restaurant up top. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3151.438s">Then</a>  we also have an unactivated riverfront that is going unused. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3157.139s">So</a>  we've partnered with a consultant and we have created a vision for the waterfront from the senior center all the way down to Sleepy Hollow. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3165.782s">And</a>  it's important to me that we get that done. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3168.822s">I</a>  envision, you know, a bear garden and an art mural and a safe place for our children to play and then a dock out to the water with some art floating in the water. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3179.665s">Then</a>  you have Sleepy Hollow that definitely needs some updating. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3183.487s">So</a>  there is so much to do, but we're getting ready to release an RFP for the three parcels, and I hope to see a lot of action on the waterfront by next spring, summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3193.712s">And</a>  we're able to get that done. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3194.992s">We've</a>  doubled our planning staff since I've taken office. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3198.034s">We</a>  have the planners. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3199.495s">We</a>  have the people in place, which Director Hunt leads, to get the job done.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3205.848s">Councilor,</a>  two minutes.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3206.928s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3207.508s">So</a>  we talk about Bedford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3210.689s">Since</a>  I've been on the council, I've seen multiple plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3214.69s">They</a>  all seem to be the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3216.11s">Some</a>  of them going back, I had one that went back to 2003, which is almost identical to the one we're putting out now. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3222.612s">We</a>  have a waterfront that other cities die for that really isn't talked to about in the plans up until recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3231.694s">We</a>  have housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3233.547s">that's</a>  in the square that could double in size, because the buildings, they're low, and you could get people to move into the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3241.777s">Part</a>  of our problem with our square talk is we always go out to committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3246.143s">We're</a>  always on committee and committee and committee, but we never, ever, ever <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3249.887s">Go</a>  to the property owner and say, how can I help you develop your property? <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3255.151s">What</a>  is your vision? <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3255.872s">What</a>  do you want to see? <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3256.613s">Everybody</a>  in this room has got great ideas for other people's property. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3259.975s">I</a>  want to talk to the property owners and see what they want to do with their property. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3262.838s">Let's</a>  find out how we can help them develop their property. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3265.38s">Let's</a>  give them some ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3266.801s">This</a>  is how we invigorate the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3269.54s">I</a>  was with my wife over the summer in Melrose Center, and we stopped in the middle of the street, and I said to her, what do you see? <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3274.725s">And</a>  she says, what are you talking about? <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3275.926s">He</a>  says, look, stand in the middle. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3277.867s">I</a>  see a square lined with trees on both sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3282.231s">Look</a>  at our square. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3283.479s">It's</a>  full of concrete, it's barren, it's not friendly. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3287.022s">I</a>  want a warm, inviting square. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3289.283s">We</a>  have a Catalyst in Chevalier Auditorium that's bringing business in. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3293.206s">We</a>  finally have a new restaurant open. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3295.188s">Let's</a>  work with, if we had an economic development working full time, we'd have somebody that maybe could drive some more business into the square so we can get more restaurants and more businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3305.055s">That's</a>  what we really need to do.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3308.658s">Mayor?</a> </p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3310.803s">I'll</a>  just respond with things do take time. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3315.408s">I've</a>  been in office a little bit over three years, and I've explained during my opening statement all the plans we put in place, all the work that we've been doing over the last three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3326.078s">I</a>  don't think it goes unnoticed. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3329.301s">by</a>  me saying we are at the point where we're gonna put an RFP out for Medford Square, we are at the point. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3336.542s">We've</a>  done the hard work, the finalized work, and we will be putting out an RFP, we will be activating our waterfront, and thankfully, we do have the people that can get that done, and that's something I'm very proud of. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3351.105s">So,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3354.106s">Similar</a>  to affordable housing, <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3356.24s">Here</a>  we are, three and a half years later, and now we're starting the process of looking at what we need to do in the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3362.786s">Should</a>  have been started on day one. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3363.987s">That</a>  should have been a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3365.688s">So</a>  why we have no development is our own fault because we're not out there trying to pull it in.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3373.78s">Before</a>  we get to the last question of this half, I just wanted to ask, Council, I'll start with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3378.764s">Are</a>  municipalities trying to discourage people from driving into cities? <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3382.868s">Because</a>  we've got these bike lanes, and one of the biggest complaints we have as reporters and photographers down in Boston is there's nowhere to park anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3390.154s">And</a>  this is an effect on everything.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3393.001s">Well,</a>  when I was on the council, there was a proposal to put in a parking garage. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3398.969s">I</a>  was one of the four councilors who supported putting a parking garage in. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3403.895s">It</a>  needed five votes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3406.499s">Mayor,</a>  any thoughts on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3409.285s">Just</a>  repeat the question, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3410.346s">I'm</a>  just wondering if municipalities are trying to discourage automobile traffic in favor of bicycle traffic and the effect that's having on parking.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3419.292s">No,</a>  I don't think so. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3420.413s">There's</a>  so many people that don't have the means or the ability to ride a bike, so I think it's about creating that balance. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3428.358s">We</a>  had a project on Winthrop that spans the whole stretch of the street, and our director came up with a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3437.064s">People</a>  were <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3438.665s">for</a>  the plan, they were against the plan, we were able to, the Traffic Commission was able to tweak it and really think about the different properties that were along the route so that we could create the parking where needed for the American Legion and for our residents that live in the high-rise development. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3454.55s">So</a>  it's about creating balance and it's about creating a space for all of Medford residents, whether you're walking, whether you're pushing a stroller, riding a bike, driving a car, <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3466.713s">We</a>  want to be able to share our roads and share it safely. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3469.594s">And</a>  that's the work we've been doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3471.515s">And</a>  we try to listen to everybody and create that balance.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3475.537s">So</a>  we have one more question for this half, and then we're going to take a break. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3479.64s">And</a>  who's next? <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3481.32s">Dan.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3481.54s">Yes,</a>  this will be our last question before the break. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3484.582s">And</a>  it's an issue that has already come up a couple of times in your discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3489.324s">But</a>  I guess this will give both of you a chance to drill down on it even more specifically. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3495.047s">The</a>  skyrocketing cost of housing, including rental housing, is making it increasingly difficult for people of modest means to live in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3504.492s">Young</a>  people in particular are forced to move farther and farther from Boston in order to find a place they can afford. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3512.516s">How</a>  can you bring more affordable housing to the city for young people, for seniors, everybody?</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3521.431s">My</a>  question? <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3522.852s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3523.052s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3523.592s">So</a>  on our current path, Medford is an unaffordable community. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3527.814s">You</a>  can ask any parent that has a child in daycare or a young family looking for an apartment to rent. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3534.158s">We</a>  need more affordable housing to support working families. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3538.92s">Our</a>  current administration stopped <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3542.341s">our</a>  40B projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3543.581s">I</a>  know we can give all the reasons why, but historically, the city does not prevail in those two cases in court, and we spent millions of dollars fighting them. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3553.225s">And</a>  we also need code enforcement to step up on our short-term rentals. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3558.807s">Airbnbs</a>  are becoming more and more prevalent in the city, which is becoming a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3564.709s">People</a>  are taking good units off the market to make them essentially hotels. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3569.03s">And</a>  that's happening especially up in the Hillside area. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3572.051s">But</a>  now you're starting to see Airbnbs creeping into the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3576.696s">There's</a>  two in my neighborhood where I live, of single family. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3580.18s">So</a>  they're out there, and we have to figure out a way to fix those. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3590.066s">We</a>  have plans for our affordable housing, and they're a bit away. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3595.571s">I</a>  know we have a housing plan, but we don't have money to fund the housing plan, and that's a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3600.495s">So</a>  I think we have to look for other means of funding to get more housing to come here. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3605.92s">And</a>  our housing authority is adding apartments on both Riverside Avenue and Walking Court.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3614.059s">Mayor,</a>  two minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3615.26s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3615.62s">I</a>  think I spent two minutes talking a lot about affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3619.261s">It</a>  was my, I think when the question was asked about the top priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3622.783s">So</a>  I don't want to repeat myself, but maybe go into a little bit about the trust and bringing in revenue for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3632.248s">And</a>  just to set the record straight on a few things, new growth is how we do a lot of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3638.831s">It's</a>  how we increase our budget and how we fund <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3642.792s">infrastructure</a>  needs as well as funds different things that will help with affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3647.535s">So</a>  just some facts. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3648.515s">In</a>  2011, we brought in $688,000 in new growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3654.73s">In</a>  2015, we're at $999,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3655.35s">New</a>  growth was just projected. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3656.791s">It's</a>  on the DLS website. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3657.912s">For</a>  fiscal year 24, which is the year we're in, we're projecting $2.75 million in new growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3662.294s">And</a>  we have gone over $2 million <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3673.979s">for</a>  the first time in 2021, and we've gone over three years so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3679.503s">So</a>  it's just something I'm proud of, and it's something that our assessing department and our building department have all worked to make a reality, coupled with our planning department. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3689.231s">And</a>  what's best about the planning that we're doing and <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3693.834s">20,</a>  40 shovels in the ground because you took two years to get to that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3701.036s">The</a>  great thing about it, it is bringing in the new growth and it's not going to stop here. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3706.137s">So</a>  I had to point that out as something that's important for budgetary purposes.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3714.779s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3715.419s">So</a>  we talk about new growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3718.56s">Look</a>  what's happened around us. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3720.799s">Look</a>  at Malden, thriving downtown. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3723.661s">Look</a>  at Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3724.762s">Look</a>  at Everett. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3727.184s">When</a>  did we become the poor sister to Malden and all these other communities? <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3731.547s">Where's</a>  our new growth? <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3733.129s">We</a>  keep talking about new growth, but all we see is little small things. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3737.732s">Downtown</a>  Malden has got a thriving <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3740.848s">downtown</a>  with housing and restaurants and shopping. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3743.73s">That's</a>  what I want to see here. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3744.911s">Look</a>  at Everett. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3745.911s">Everett</a>  finally figured it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3748.113s">Developers</a>  are swarming Everett. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3752.076s">They</a>  still have cranes in the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3753.537s">Every</a>  time you turn around, they're building new housing there. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3757.659s">Where</a>  is ours? <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3760.001s">We've</a>  waited too long. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3761.502s">I</a>  mean, there's a lot of talk, but no action happening here. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3765.324s">I</a>  want to see shovels in the ground over the last three years, and we really haven't seen that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3772.301s">Mayor,</a>  you have one minute.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3776.834s">This</a>  is actually one of the top three reasons I ran in 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3780.596s">It</a>  was the fact that our commercial tax base was declining, steadily declining. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3786.277s">And</a>  since I took office, it is now increasing. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3790.258s">We</a>  also had an issue with public trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3793.159s">We</a>  had a zoning board of appeals that violated open meeting law. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3796.94s">They</a>  ended up resigning. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3798.681s">And</a>  over the first year in my term, while going through a pandemic, we were building that trust back. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3804.202s">As</a>  I met with developers, with our planning team and our economic development team, we sat with them and we said, please, just have a community meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3813.811s">We</a>  need to build trust back among our residents, and that's what we do every time. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3818.356s">So</a>  the 20 or 30 properties, including the eight-story life science complex that's going above the Bertucci site, <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3826.503s">It's</a>  finally out of a court with a neighbor, and that is moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3830.325s">That's</a>  just one of tens and 20, 30 different projects that we are moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3835.628s">It</a>  takes time. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3838.829s">It's</a>  not something I could fix overnight with the snap of a finger. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzVMKD4eu5I&t=3841.811s">But</a>  we're doing it right, and we're going to continue to do it.</p>
