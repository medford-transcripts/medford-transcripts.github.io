1
00:03:34,628 --> 00:03:37,750
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is all before we get to any of this?

2
00:03:38,311 --> 00:03:39,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

3
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:45,636
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'll come at 7, I'll start off, we'll do all this stuff, get it all done, and then I'll introduce you.

4
00:03:54,121 --> 00:03:54,221
[SPEAKER_11]: th th

5
00:05:54,884 --> 00:05:55,965
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you sing professionally?

6
00:05:55,985 --> 00:05:56,726
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

7
00:05:56,866 --> 00:05:57,786
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.

8
00:05:58,167 --> 00:06:15,661
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, is that it, Steve?

00:06:55,229 --> 00:06:55,269
th

00:07:29,906 --> 00:07:31,048
Thank you.

11
00:07:48,216 --> 00:07:51,999
[SPEAKER_09]: So, Steve, are they going to wait off stage?

12
00:07:52,779 --> 00:07:55,181
[SPEAKER_09]: Because Jim's going to introduce them.

13
00:07:55,501 --> 00:07:58,183
[SPEAKER_09]: You can do it that way.

14
00:07:59,544 --> 00:08:00,625
[SPEAKER_09]: Natalie's going to get them now.

15
00:08:00,765 --> 00:08:01,206
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, she is?

16
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:02,667
[SPEAKER_09]: And then as soon as they hear.

th th

19
00:09:31,651 --> 00:09:35,375
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll just have you guys off stage, and then I'll do the welcome and bring you guys on.

20
00:09:35,415 --> 00:09:42,561
[SPEAKER_09]: Does that work?

21
00:09:43,903 --> 00:09:49,307
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening, and welcome to the 2023 Medford Chamber of Commerce Mayoral Debate.

22
00:09:49,988 --> 00:09:50,949
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Rocco DiRico.

23
00:09:50,969 --> 00:09:52,731
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm the president of the Medford Chamber of Commerce.

24
00:09:53,697 --> 00:09:59,784
[SPEAKER_08]: The Medford Chamber of Commerce provides a unified voice for the business community and for business districts of Medford.

25
00:10:00,565 --> 00:10:03,608
[SPEAKER_08]: Today the chamber is bigger, better, and stronger than ever.

26
00:10:04,289 --> 00:10:08,574
[SPEAKER_08]: We have over 250 members and more than 20 platinum members.

27
00:10:09,255 --> 00:10:14,621
[SPEAKER_08]: And every day the chamber fights to preserve, protect, and promote all the businesses of the city of Medford.

28
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,303
[SPEAKER_08]: It is so great to have this year's debate at the McGlynn School.

29
00:10:19,863 --> 00:10:26,308
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanna publicly thank Principal Nick Tucci and Medford Public Schools for hosting this year's debate.

30
00:10:26,809 --> 00:10:31,632
[SPEAKER_08]: We're so thankful, they've been wonderful hosts for us.

31
00:10:31,853 --> 00:10:36,076
[SPEAKER_08]: Tonight's debate is also the most accessible debate that we've had of these debates.

32
00:10:36,376 --> 00:10:43,742
[SPEAKER_08]: It's being broadcast live on Medford Community Media and YouTube, and a big thank you to Kevin Harrington and his team from Medford Community Media.

33
00:10:45,452 --> 00:10:47,874
[SPEAKER_08]: It took a lot of people to put this debate together.

34
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:58,242
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to thank the Government Affairs Committee of the Chamber, Co-Chairs Stephen Pompeo and Dominic Camara, Maury Carroll, Natalie Breen, and Jamie Thompson.

35
00:10:59,382 --> 00:11:04,086
[SPEAKER_08]: I also want to thank our Executive Director, Laura O'Neill.

36
00:11:04,786 --> 00:11:07,809
[SPEAKER_08]: She is like a one-woman multinational corporation.

37
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:13,212
[SPEAKER_08]: She is our only staff member and runs everything that the Chamber does, so thank you, Laura, for all you do.

38
00:11:14,293 --> 00:11:24,617
[SPEAKER_08]: I also want to thank Laurel Siegel, who helped us promote this debate, and tonight's ushers, Sam Tarabelsi, Justin Lasko, Rosemary Adania, and Christina Del Sol.

39
00:11:26,157 --> 00:11:29,438
[SPEAKER_08]: Tonight's debate really would not be possible without all their hard work.

40
00:11:29,478 --> 00:11:37,541
[SPEAKER_08]: We are a totally volunteer organization, aside from Laura and all these folks have donated a lot of hours over the last two months to make that happen.

41
00:11:38,393 --> 00:11:43,256
[SPEAKER_08]: We're also thrilled tonight because Jim Morelli from Fox 25 is our moderator.

42
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:48,619
[SPEAKER_08]: As many of you know, Carrie Kavanaugh has moderated this debate in the past.

43
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:53,742
[SPEAKER_08]: She was not available tonight because she's receiving a very prestigious award in Washington, D.C.

44
00:11:54,282 --> 00:11:58,925
[SPEAKER_08]: But I want to thank Carrie because she convinced Jim to help us out tonight, so I really appreciate it.

45
00:11:59,725 --> 00:12:06,953
[SPEAKER_08]: I also want to thank offstage Bill O'Keefe, who's going to be our timekeeper for tonight, which is a very stressful job.

46
00:12:08,174 --> 00:12:09,575
[SPEAKER_08]: And a big thank you to our panel.

47
00:12:10,036 --> 00:12:12,659
[SPEAKER_08]: Dan Kennedy has done this for us a number of times.

48
00:12:12,719 --> 00:12:14,641
[SPEAKER_08]: Dan Kennedy is from Northeastern University.

49
00:12:15,241 --> 00:12:16,983
[SPEAKER_08]: Penny Outlaw from the DeMock Center.

50
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:19,385
[SPEAKER_08]: Mark Shanahan of the Boston Globe.

51
00:12:20,126 --> 00:12:23,268
[SPEAKER_08]: and Anne-Marie Gallagher of the Medford Historical Society.

52
00:12:23,288 --> 00:12:29,211
[SPEAKER_08]: We're so fortunate to have so many of these talented people serving on our panel.

53
00:12:30,392 --> 00:12:34,654
[SPEAKER_08]: And I want to make it clear, they are the only people who have seen the questions for tonight.

54
00:12:35,034 --> 00:12:40,357
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody on the board, none of the candidates, nobody has seen the questions that have been submitted except for the panel.

55
00:12:41,331 --> 00:12:44,252
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course, I really want to thank both candidates.

56
00:12:45,512 --> 00:12:54,094
[SPEAKER_08]: I've known both of these candidates for a very long time, and they are both incredibly dedicated public servants, and I have tremendous respect for both of them.

57
00:12:54,675 --> 00:13:04,057
[SPEAKER_08]: It takes a lot of courage and incredible dedication and time away from your family to run for public office, and I think they're two amazing candidates.

58
00:13:04,757 --> 00:13:10,239
[SPEAKER_08]: But I do want to emphasize that the Medford Chamber of Commerce is a nonpartisan organization.

59
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:14,520
[SPEAKER_08]: We have not and we will not endorse either candidate.

60
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:19,002
[SPEAKER_08]: No member of the Chamber of Commerce has seen any of tonight's questions.

61
00:13:19,722 --> 00:13:22,443
[SPEAKER_08]: Neither candidate has seen any of tonight's questions.

62
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:29,865
[SPEAKER_08]: The questions that you hear tonight are all questions that were submitted by Medford residents.

63
00:13:31,496 --> 00:13:34,718
[SPEAKER_08]: This debate is for you, the residents of Medford.

64
00:13:35,419 --> 00:13:40,342
[SPEAKER_08]: So I ask that you please do not boo or cheer for any candidate.

65
00:13:40,902 --> 00:13:43,664
[SPEAKER_08]: That'll only take away from your candidate's time.

66
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:47,247
[SPEAKER_08]: We're just hoping for a peaceful civil debate here tonight.

67
00:13:48,307 --> 00:13:56,293
[SPEAKER_08]: And now I'm gonna introduce Steven Pompeo, who is the co-chair of our Government Affairs Committee, and his grandniece, Cece.

68
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,141
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Rocco.

69
00:14:05,961 --> 00:14:15,509
[SPEAKER_10]: If you would all please rise as we recite the Pledge of Allegiance, led by Cecilia Pompeo, second grade student at the Brooks School.

70
00:14:17,711 --> 00:14:18,592
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to have to use this one.

71
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:45,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

72
00:14:49,646 --> 00:14:50,047
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

73
00:14:51,248 --> 00:14:54,811
[SPEAKER_10]: And now, Dominic Camara will sing God Bless America.

74
00:14:56,553 --> 00:14:57,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Join in.

75
00:14:57,553 --> 00:14:57,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Three.

76
00:14:58,825 --> 00:15:07,176
[SPEAKER_04]: 2, 1, God bless America, land that I love.

77
00:15:07,696 --> 00:15:15,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Stand beside her and guide her through the night with the light from above.

78
00:15:16,608 --> 00:15:33,172
[SPEAKER_04]: From the mountains, to the prairies, to the oceans, wide with foam, God bless America, my home sweet home.

79
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:39,474
[SPEAKER_04]: God bless America, my home sweet home.

80
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,471
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much, Dominic.

81
00:15:49,551 --> 00:15:51,232
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, thank you all for being here.

82
00:15:51,392 --> 00:15:55,954
[SPEAKER_08]: It's now my great pleasure to introduce Jim Morelli from Fox 25.

83
00:15:55,994 --> 00:15:56,454
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, sir.

84
00:15:57,615 --> 00:15:59,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

85
00:16:02,068 --> 00:16:06,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Before I bring out the candidates, I just want to let you know I've never done this before.

86
00:16:06,651 --> 00:16:12,195
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing I've ever moderated are arguments between my son and my wife, and they basically usually ignored me.

87
00:16:12,895 --> 00:16:16,418
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a high bar from Carrie to try to aspire to.

88
00:16:16,498 --> 00:16:17,999
[SPEAKER_02]: I probably won't get quite there.

89
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:19,580
[SPEAKER_02]: She is a Medford native after all.

90
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:27,121
[SPEAKER_02]: And the low bar was given to me last week by the Fox Channel's Republican debate.

91
00:16:27,181 --> 00:16:30,042
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if anyone saw it, but if you did, you know what I mean.

92
00:16:30,102 --> 00:16:32,422
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty much a disaster.

93
00:16:32,502 --> 00:16:34,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully, we will rise above that.

94
00:16:34,603 --> 00:16:36,603
[SPEAKER_02]: And with that, I'd like to introduce our candidates.

95
00:16:36,763 --> 00:16:38,304
[SPEAKER_02]: The mayor, Breonna Lungo-Koehn.

96
00:16:42,264 --> 00:16:44,125
[SPEAKER_02]: And City Councilor Richard Caraviello.

97
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:57,585
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to go over the rules here, and the way it's going to work is like this.

98
00:16:57,745 --> 00:17:15,992
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, the mayor will be giving an opening statement, which means the first question will go to the counselor, and each candidate will have two minutes to answer, and then candidate A will have a chance to rebuttal, followed by candidate B will also have a chance to rebuttal, and then we'll take turns answering questions.

99
00:17:16,533 --> 00:17:18,675
[SPEAKER_02]: and we'll take turns with our panel as well.

100
00:17:19,335 --> 00:17:24,859
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we will have a lightning round in which each candidate will have 30 seconds to answer questions.

101
00:17:25,259 --> 00:17:27,441
[SPEAKER_02]: And so with that, I'd like to introduce our panel.

102
00:17:27,681 --> 00:17:27,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan.

103
00:17:30,438 --> 00:17:31,179
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Jim.

104
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:40,869
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's really an honor for me and the rest of our panelists to take part in this debate, and we thank the Medford Chamber of Commerce for organizing it once again.

105
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:43,252
[SPEAKER_06]: All of us have been here before.

106
00:17:44,893 --> 00:17:48,337
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to skip the introduction because Rocco already did that.

107
00:17:48,797 --> 00:17:50,359
[SPEAKER_06]: We're all Medford residents.

108
00:17:50,459 --> 00:17:51,841
[SPEAKER_06]: I did want to point that out.

109
00:17:53,022 --> 00:18:05,092
[SPEAKER_06]: As with past debates, we compiled our questions based on suggestions by members of the public who submitted their ideas through an email account that could be accessed only by the four members of the panel.

110
00:18:05,773 --> 00:18:13,779
[SPEAKER_06]: More than 60 people responded, and we thank all of them for taking the time to identify the issues that they want the candidates to discuss.

111
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:23,005
[SPEAKER_06]: Later, the panel met and narrowed those suggestions down to a series of full-length questions and some lightning round questions.

112
00:18:23,525 --> 00:18:30,970
[SPEAKER_06]: We also have a few questions in reserve in the unlikely event that we're looking to fill time, so we'll see how that goes.

113
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:34,372
[SPEAKER_06]: So with that, let's get on with the debate.

114
00:18:36,973 --> 00:18:37,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

115
00:18:37,674 --> 00:18:39,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we begin, though, I do want to say this.

116
00:18:40,609 --> 00:18:44,711
[SPEAKER_02]: As has already been stated, running for office is a huge sacrifice.

117
00:18:44,831 --> 00:18:49,694
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I am sure you guys have spent many, many late, late, late, late nights away from family.

118
00:18:49,774 --> 00:18:50,714
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot of time.

119
00:18:51,335 --> 00:18:56,057
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is what basically makes our democracy run, people who are willing to run for office.

120
00:18:56,517 --> 00:18:58,118
[SPEAKER_02]: So please keep that in mind.

121
00:18:58,238 --> 00:18:59,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Please keep respect in mind.

122
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:01,380
[SPEAKER_02]: And be nice.

123
00:19:03,493 --> 00:19:04,894
[SPEAKER_02]: First question goes to the council.

124
00:19:04,914 --> 00:19:05,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Two minutes.

125
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:07,415
[SPEAKER_02]: Opening.

126
00:19:08,096 --> 00:19:08,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Opening.

127
00:19:08,556 --> 00:19:09,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm so sorry.

128
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:09,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Opening.

129
00:19:09,697 --> 00:19:10,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.

130
00:19:10,417 --> 00:19:10,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

131
00:19:11,718 --> 00:19:13,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I just, sorry.

132
00:19:14,619 --> 00:19:20,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you to the chamber, to the panelists, to Jim for the opportunity tonight to talk about the issues facing our city.

133
00:19:21,383 --> 00:19:25,825
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Breanna Lungo-Koehn and I am proud to have served as your mayor since 2020.

134
00:19:27,205 --> 00:19:34,608
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm proud to call Medford home, raise my family here, and serve my neighbors first as city councilor and now as your mayor.

135
00:19:35,548 --> 00:19:39,130
[SPEAKER_05]: I have led the city with the same values that this community instilled in me.

136
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:43,612
[SPEAKER_05]: that integrity, hard work, and helping the people of Medford come first.

137
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:56,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Over the past three and a half years, we have worked together to deliver key wins for Medford, recovering from the pandemic by delivering the supports to our businesses, schools, neighbors in the city.

138
00:19:57,319 --> 00:20:01,621
[SPEAKER_05]: We did a street and sidewalk audit assessment to start working on the backloads

139
00:20:01,943 --> 00:20:03,725
[SPEAKER_05]: backlog of decades of neglect.

140
00:20:04,485 --> 00:20:16,576
[SPEAKER_05]: We've developed Medford's first comprehensive multi-year capital improvement plan, including millions of dollars for improvements to our streets, sidewalks, fire stations, schools, parks, tree canopy, and so much more.

141
00:20:17,497 --> 00:20:22,322
[SPEAKER_05]: We drafted the first ever master plan to create a 30-year vision for our future.

142
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:29,825
[SPEAKER_05]: We finalized the Climate Action and Adaptation Plan and have been hard at work implementing so we can meet our climate goals.

143
00:20:30,705 --> 00:20:33,807
[SPEAKER_05]: We reworked the city's website and budget process.

144
00:20:34,588 --> 00:20:37,850
[SPEAKER_05]: We received the city's first ever Distinguished Budget Award.

145
00:20:38,711 --> 00:20:44,214
[SPEAKER_05]: We have completed a housing production plan to help guide us in our work to make Medford more affordable for all.

146
00:20:45,215 --> 00:20:47,897
[SPEAKER_05]: We hired the first Economic Development Director

147
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:54,119
[SPEAKER_05]: and the city's first facilities maintenance director, and I have built a team that gets things done.

148
00:20:55,739 --> 00:21:05,042
[SPEAKER_05]: There is still important work that remains as our city faces great opportunities and tough challenges, which is why I'm running for another term as your mayor of Medford.

149
00:21:05,702 --> 00:21:09,763
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking forward to answering your questions tonight, and I hope to earn your vote on November 7th.

150
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:10,363
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

151
00:21:14,332 --> 00:21:18,915
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, and on behalf of myself, thank you to the panel, thank you to everyone here.

152
00:21:19,135 --> 00:21:25,378
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would like to thank the chamber for hosting this debate, for all of you in attendance tonight, and for those of you watching from home.

153
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:36,625
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Rick Caraviello, and I'm running for mayor out of a genuine love and concern for our city, and I want to help keep Medford to be a great place to live, work, and raise a family.

154
00:21:37,265 --> 00:21:41,348
[SPEAKER_00]: I bring a consistent, transparent, and hands-on approach to Medford City government.

155
00:21:42,088 --> 00:21:45,731
[SPEAKER_00]: Too many of us know there's a distinct lack of vision coming out of City Hall.

156
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:49,053
[SPEAKER_00]: Our economic growth lags behind neighboring communities.

157
00:21:49,673 --> 00:21:53,476
[SPEAKER_00]: Our schools are underperforming and lack proper safety protocols.

158
00:21:54,096 --> 00:21:56,518
[SPEAKER_00]: Our roads and sidewalks are in complete disrepair.

159
00:21:57,299 --> 00:22:00,721
[SPEAKER_00]: Too many critical positions in City Hall are left unfilled.

160
00:22:01,422 --> 00:22:03,203
[SPEAKER_00]: Our public employees are frustrated.

161
00:22:04,103 --> 00:22:05,925
[SPEAKER_00]: And our squares need to be reinvigorated.

162
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:10,532
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a 12-year veteran of the Medford City Council, serving as president for three times.

163
00:22:11,252 --> 00:22:13,593
[SPEAKER_00]: I have never been one to seek out the limelight.

164
00:22:13,813 --> 00:22:14,914
[SPEAKER_00]: I just get the job done.

165
00:22:15,954 --> 00:22:19,876
[SPEAKER_00]: As many of you said along the campaign trail, Rick answers the call.

166
00:22:19,896 --> 00:22:24,418
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now, people are calling me from across Medford, calling for new leadership.

167
00:22:25,287 --> 00:22:34,331
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my proudest public service accomplishments is bringing a new state-of-the-art public library to the city of Medford, along with being the co-chair of the Medford Public Library Foundation.

168
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:48,658
[SPEAKER_00]: Another accomplishment was partnering with Councilor Marks, Arts Collaborative Medford, and Theory Wellness to deliver a long-awaited arts center that will offer a fresh, safe, and long-awaited center for Medford residents of all ages.

169
00:22:49,699 --> 00:22:52,060
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand what we need to move Metro forward.

170
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,141
[SPEAKER_00]: And to do that, we need real leadership in the mayor's office.

171
00:22:55,442 --> 00:23:02,205
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am running for mayor for each and every one of you, whether you are a lifetime resident or just chose Metro to be your home now.

172
00:23:02,885 --> 00:23:03,185
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

173
00:23:11,969 --> 00:23:14,550
[SPEAKER_02]: And Dan Kennedy has the first question for Councilor Caraviello.

174
00:23:15,291 --> 00:23:16,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Two minutes to answer.

175
00:23:16,758 --> 00:23:24,263
[SPEAKER_06]: Tonight we're going to be asking both of you to react to questions about various issues that residents of Medford have shared with us.

176
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:28,286
[SPEAKER_06]: But we'd like to begin by asking a question that is proactive.

177
00:23:28,906 --> 00:23:39,493
[SPEAKER_06]: What will be your number one priority, your single priority as mayor during the next two years, understanding that you'll do more than one thing, but what is number one?

178
00:23:40,114 --> 00:23:43,056
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one priority would be filling vacancies that are in City Hall.

179
00:23:43,816 --> 00:23:44,977
[SPEAKER_00]: We have no city solicitor.

180
00:23:46,482 --> 00:23:48,423
[SPEAKER_00]: We have no building commissioner.

181
00:23:49,464 --> 00:23:54,427
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a part-time economic development director.

182
00:23:54,487 --> 00:23:59,370
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are my first three priorities as soon as I walk into office.

183
00:24:06,156 --> 00:24:06,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

184
00:24:06,537 --> 00:24:07,337
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a great question.

185
00:24:08,358 --> 00:24:17,585
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, I think all the work we've been doing is so important, so it's a hard question to answer, but I'll start with answering it with regards to housing.

186
00:24:17,766 --> 00:24:23,911
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we see a crisis in the Commonwealth, and we also see the crisis here in Medford.

187
00:24:24,751 --> 00:24:34,157
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we've been able to do is create a master plan as well as a housing production plan that we are enacting currently and want to continue to enact.

188
00:24:34,778 --> 00:24:42,643
[SPEAKER_05]: We work with the council, we got that approved, and we also built in an affordable housing trust, which was also approved.

189
00:24:43,143 --> 00:24:50,448
[SPEAKER_05]: That trust is gonna, we're gonna create a board of members of our city, experts to help create more affordable housing.

190
00:24:50,928 --> 00:24:53,810
[SPEAKER_05]: We're also going to continue to work with our 40B developments.

191
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:56,971
[SPEAKER_05]: The first one we just finalized was Mill Creek.

192
00:24:57,451 --> 00:25:03,194
[SPEAKER_05]: That is going to add 350 new units to Medford, 88 of which will be affordable.

193
00:25:03,715 --> 00:25:06,236
[SPEAKER_05]: We are going to continue to work with the Medford Housing Authority.

194
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:12,779
[SPEAKER_05]: They are rehabbing all the units on Riverside Ave, and they are adding 22 additional units.

195
00:25:12,879 --> 00:25:17,181
[SPEAKER_05]: We've supported them through the city with helping offset some of their permit costs.

196
00:25:17,802 --> 00:25:20,223
[SPEAKER_05]: We also have the development at Walkland Court.

197
00:25:21,223 --> 00:25:34,326
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a hundred additional affordable housing units that will be added and then a rehab for all of our seniors and disabled population to have a quality living situation and to add 122 units.

198
00:25:34,346 --> 00:25:38,527
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to continue to support the Housing Authority.

199
00:25:38,607 --> 00:25:41,788
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to continue to bring in development like we have over the last

200
00:25:42,888 --> 00:25:43,568
[SPEAKER_05]: several years.

201
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:53,651
[SPEAKER_05]: We did a lot of planning to get here and right now we have about 10 additional projects bringing in over 185 additional units to create housing in this city.

202
00:25:54,391 --> 00:26:03,274
[SPEAKER_05]: We have commissioned a team with MAPC and our planning and development team to redo Medford Square to also bring in new housing.

203
00:26:03,994 --> 00:26:04,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

204
00:26:05,615 --> 00:26:06,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Council, you have one minute to rebut.

205
00:26:07,655 --> 00:26:07,995
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

206
00:26:08,395 --> 00:26:09,796
[SPEAKER_00]: So we talk about housing.

207
00:26:11,212 --> 00:26:15,138
[SPEAKER_00]: Why have we waited three years to get our 240B projects off the ground?

208
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,384
[SPEAKER_00]: These are projects that should have been started three years ago.

209
00:26:19,725 --> 00:26:23,771
[SPEAKER_00]: They would have been probably been up now generating taxes and housing families.

210
00:26:24,312 --> 00:26:27,036
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's been an issue from day one.

211
00:26:29,164 --> 00:26:39,549
[SPEAKER_00]: I've agreed with the mayor, with all the housing authority, I've supported the walking club project, redoing all the 121 Riverside Avenue.

212
00:26:39,569 --> 00:26:44,032
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do need more housing because Medford is an unaffordable community.

213
00:26:44,472 --> 00:26:50,695
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to do what we need to do to make Medford more affordable by providing more affordable housing.

214
00:26:52,616 --> 00:26:53,216
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor, you have a minute?

215
00:26:53,657 --> 00:26:54,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, thank you.

216
00:26:55,376 --> 00:27:02,659
[SPEAKER_05]: When I came into office January 2020, I had three 40B developments dropped on our table.

217
00:27:03,299 --> 00:27:16,465
[SPEAKER_05]: So we commissioned the team led by Director Hunt and myself, as well as help from engineering and other departments, and we created, we assessed our landmass area.

218
00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:18,626
[SPEAKER_05]: and we met that threshold.

219
00:27:18,866 --> 00:27:27,830
[SPEAKER_05]: That gave us the leverage to push these 40 bees and have a seat at the table so they just didn't come in and do whatever they wanted in our community.

220
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:31,892
[SPEAKER_05]: We made sure that the buildings are sustainable.

221
00:27:32,132 --> 00:27:35,633
[SPEAKER_05]: We want updates to walkability around the facility.

222
00:27:35,713 --> 00:27:37,214
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to make sure the residents in those

223
00:27:38,395 --> 00:27:40,016
[SPEAKER_05]: complexes have green space.

224
00:27:40,457 --> 00:27:52,508
[SPEAKER_05]: By doing the tough work, we were able to turn what was promised 12-story high-rise luxury apartment complex on Mystic Ave into a $1 billion life science proposal that is before us today.

225
00:27:52,968 --> 00:27:54,630
[SPEAKER_05]: We did it right, and I'm proud of it.

226
00:27:57,361 --> 00:27:58,442
[SPEAKER_07]: Any question for the mayor?

227
00:27:59,962 --> 00:28:14,548
[SPEAKER_07]: A number of residents who contacted us want to know about your approach to property taxes and whether you support a Proposition 2.5 override, either a general override or a debt exclusion to build a new fire station in high school.

228
00:28:14,828 --> 00:28:17,730
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you allow such a question to go to the voters?

229
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:19,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Penny.

230
00:28:20,311 --> 00:28:21,151
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a great question.

231
00:28:21,331 --> 00:28:26,933
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have a lot of needs, as I saw when we came into office, a lot of infrastructure needs.

232
00:28:27,053 --> 00:28:31,854
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think the top priority for me as your mayor is what we've been doing.

233
00:28:31,914 --> 00:28:41,537
[SPEAKER_05]: The school committee and I commissioned a consultant to review Medford High School and to submit a high-quality application to the MSBA.

234
00:28:42,157 --> 00:28:43,938
[SPEAKER_05]: We were 14th in line last year.

235
00:28:44,571 --> 00:28:46,513
[SPEAKER_05]: because of inflation, they only took 10.

236
00:28:46,994 --> 00:28:58,769
[SPEAKER_05]: We resubmitted in April, and we have our fingers crossed in such high hopes that we will get the MSBA loan to fund potentially half of a new construction of a new high school.

237
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:00,411
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be almost $200 million.

238
00:29:00,431 --> 00:29:00,651
[SPEAKER_05]: So for me,

239
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:10,500
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to obviously see where our taxpayers are at, but we will need a debt exclusion for a new high school.

240
00:29:10,601 --> 00:29:16,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Our children deserve it, and our faculty deserve it, and it is in deplorable condition.

241
00:29:16,525 --> 00:29:19,407
[SPEAKER_05]: We're working on updates, but it's just not enough.

242
00:29:19,648 --> 00:29:23,471
[SPEAKER_05]: So I do feel that the top priority is a debt exclusion.

243
00:29:23,591 --> 00:29:29,635
[SPEAKER_05]: I also plan, we have a meeting scheduled with the president and vice president of the council, because

244
00:29:30,376 --> 00:29:34,360
[SPEAKER_05]: priority number one for me when I came in was a new fire station.

245
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,002
[SPEAKER_05]: We need a new fire station.

246
00:29:36,042 --> 00:29:45,871
[SPEAKER_05]: I always planned to go out to Bond and we'd put the debt service on our general fund budget, but the counselors want to explore debt exclusion for that as well.

247
00:29:46,992 --> 00:29:49,615
[SPEAKER_05]: My stance has always been we need to

248
00:29:49,875 --> 00:29:52,276
[SPEAKER_05]: to know where our taxpayers are.

249
00:29:52,636 --> 00:30:05,222
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to give them the facts on what it will cost to do those two things and decide if we have the ability to additionally, I know there's a push on the council for additional override for the general fund budget.

250
00:30:05,582 --> 00:30:07,182
[SPEAKER_05]: That's something we need to explore.

251
00:30:07,202 --> 00:30:08,063
[SPEAKER_05]: I have people that

252
00:30:08,943 --> 00:30:11,425
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, hate us that we won't do, we won't do it immediately.

253
00:30:11,485 --> 00:30:16,308
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we have people calling saying they can't afford food for their table or these high rents.

254
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:25,355
[SPEAKER_05]: So we need to take a approach where the council and the school in the school committee and myself, as well as the residents make those tough, tough decisions.

255
00:30:26,055 --> 00:30:26,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor, you have two minutes.

256
00:30:27,697 --> 00:30:28,037
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

257
00:30:28,477 --> 00:30:30,739
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, do we support a new high school?

258
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,161
[SPEAKER_00]: A high school is 52 years old.

259
00:30:33,241 --> 00:30:34,982
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the second graduating class out of there.

260
00:30:35,562 --> 00:30:37,824
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I was there last week talking to students,

261
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:40,532
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looks the same as when I moved in there.

262
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:53,923
[SPEAKER_00]: When we were on the council with the mayor, in the last 10 years, the state has given us millions of dollars to redo our science labs, our vocational school, and the pool, and different other projects there.

263
00:30:54,864 --> 00:31:00,169
[SPEAKER_00]: So with our declining enrollment at Medford High School, which is about 1,100 students,

264
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:03,851
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel that there's room for improvement there.

265
00:31:03,872 --> 00:31:07,017
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we could shut down sections of the building, rehab them properly.

266
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:11,383
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as I said, there's plenty of room.

267
00:31:11,963 --> 00:31:13,905
[SPEAKER_00]: The school was built for four to 5,000 students.

268
00:31:14,425 --> 00:31:15,726
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also have many other priorities.

269
00:31:15,827 --> 00:31:17,128
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a crumbling infrastructure.

270
00:31:17,148 --> 00:31:23,333
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a water and sewer system that I think we all agree that's ready to crumble over years in neglect.

271
00:31:23,793 --> 00:31:25,454
[SPEAKER_00]: We need roads, we need sidewalks.

272
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:30,718
[SPEAKER_00]: This city needs a lot of things, and along with our fire station, that's been promised.

273
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:38,745
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to get out, before we start making decisions for $300 million, I think we need to sit and figure out what our real priorities are.

274
00:31:40,615 --> 00:31:41,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Mayor, you have a minute.

275
00:31:42,436 --> 00:31:43,296
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll have to unload there.

276
00:31:44,137 --> 00:31:44,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

277
00:31:46,118 --> 00:32:04,946
[SPEAKER_05]: With regards to the MSBA loan, I think it's important to point out that if we desperately need that funding and we need to match that funding 50%, and the MSBA doesn't allow us to choose where to put the high school or how to rebuild, they're gonna tell us what belongs in a high school built for 1,200, 1,300 students.

278
00:32:06,767 --> 00:32:09,489
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is a $350 million price tag.

279
00:32:09,929 --> 00:32:20,677
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have to be serious about committing to our students, committing to our educators, and get a new high school built the right way, and let the MSBA lead that process.

280
00:32:21,197 --> 00:32:22,298
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm very hopeful.

281
00:32:22,338 --> 00:32:25,681
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not certain, but I'm very hopeful that we'll be able to be successful in that.

282
00:32:25,781 --> 00:32:28,983
[SPEAKER_05]: And we need leadership that can get the job done.

283
00:32:29,043 --> 00:32:31,605
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think I've proven that over the years.

284
00:32:32,345 --> 00:32:36,889
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we talk about infrastructure, our roads, our sidewalks, our trees, we're getting it done.

285
00:32:37,049 --> 00:32:42,173
[SPEAKER_05]: This construction season alone, we've done two miles of sidewalk, two miles.

286
00:32:42,773 --> 00:32:43,774
[SPEAKER_05]: That doesn't come easy.

287
00:32:43,814 --> 00:32:47,717
[SPEAKER_05]: It comes with hard work, it comes with leadership, and it comes with a team that can get it done.

288
00:32:48,178 --> 00:32:52,581
[SPEAKER_05]: And they have been doing a lot of work, our engineers and our Department of Public Works, and we're getting it done.

289
00:32:54,162 --> 00:32:54,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilwoman?

290
00:32:55,684 --> 00:32:56,644
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

291
00:32:57,025 --> 00:33:01,068
[SPEAKER_00]: The mayor's right, we have started doing it, but we started doing it now.

292
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:05,992
[SPEAKER_00]: Where have we been the last couple of years when these projects should have been going on?

293
00:33:06,433 --> 00:33:14,958
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, I agree with you, we're doing it now, and we're doing roads, and we're doing sidewalks, just too little too late.

294
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:20,582
[SPEAKER_02]: May I just ask a question, Mayor, since we have a little time?

295
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:30,826
[SPEAKER_02]: A recent rating showed that the proficiency rating of students at Medford High was 41% for math, 62% for reading.

296
00:33:32,488 --> 00:33:34,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Will the new building help that, do you think?

297
00:33:35,516 --> 00:33:43,039
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the ratings show what students have gone through with the pandemic.

298
00:33:43,719 --> 00:33:45,740
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of that has to do with mental health.

299
00:33:46,460 --> 00:34:00,785
[SPEAKER_05]: And to be in a building that's 60 years old that doesn't have the proper AC and ventilation and heating at times can do wonders for students' mental health and create an atmosphere that is more conducive to learning.

300
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:01,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I do.

301
00:34:03,018 --> 00:34:04,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor, you have any thought on that?

302
00:34:04,499 --> 00:34:04,699
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

303
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:12,602
[SPEAKER_00]: A new building will always bring new morale, but the children are taught from the teachers.

304
00:34:12,682 --> 00:34:14,542
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the ones whose morale are low.

305
00:34:15,023 --> 00:34:16,223
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the ones that need the help.

306
00:34:21,325 --> 00:34:22,385
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the ones that need the help.

307
00:34:23,826 --> 00:34:23,946
[SPEAKER_00]: So,

308
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:40,320
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to see a new high school built, but I just think we need to bring our teachers in, give them the tools that they need to teach the students what they have to teach them, and they're the ones that'll bring the proficiency up, not a new building.

309
00:34:43,115 --> 00:34:47,938
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, please, if you could refrain from cheering, it just takes up time.

310
00:34:47,978 --> 00:34:50,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Mark, you have a question for the councilor.

311
00:34:50,259 --> 00:34:52,660
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, can you, is this working?

312
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:53,300
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's working.

313
00:34:54,361 --> 00:35:01,905
[SPEAKER_11]: So last December, the city agreed to a new contract with the teachers union after a year of tough negotiations.

314
00:35:02,165 --> 00:35:09,129
[SPEAKER_11]: The firefighters union, who I think you may have seen outside, has been without a contract for a few years.

315
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:25,576
[SPEAKER_11]: How or where do you propose to find the money to pay fair wages and salaries to city employees, union and non-union, at a time of high inflation and limited resources?

316
00:35:27,597 --> 00:35:31,018
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of my extra money we get comes from new growth in our community.

317
00:35:31,518 --> 00:35:32,939
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to push for new growth.

318
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:34,379
[SPEAKER_00]: We need building permit fees.

319
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,361
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the things, and new taxes, when buildings go up,

320
00:35:38,206 --> 00:35:40,347
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where we get the money to pay the raises.

321
00:35:41,628 --> 00:35:48,571
[SPEAKER_00]: And we shouldn't be waiting three years to negotiate contracts, because now we're looking for back pay to pay these people.

322
00:35:49,011 --> 00:35:52,492
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're signing contracts today, and next year they're up.

323
00:35:52,913 --> 00:35:55,174
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not gaining any ground at all.

324
00:35:55,834 --> 00:36:05,078
[SPEAKER_00]: So my priority is to sit at the table in the beginning, not let them fester for two and three years, negotiate them soon, and give everybody a fair and equal contract.

325
00:36:06,779 --> 00:36:07,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Mayor, two minutes.

326
00:36:09,192 --> 00:36:09,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

327
00:36:10,196 --> 00:36:12,486
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll start by saying that.

328
00:36:14,436 --> 00:36:19,719
[SPEAKER_05]: About a year ago, most of the contracts in the city, in the school side, became due.

329
00:36:19,979 --> 00:36:26,123
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was, other than fire, it was the first time we had 20 contracts that we were trying to negotiate.

330
00:36:27,584 --> 00:36:43,073
[SPEAKER_05]: We have since settled with our teachers, we've settled with clerical, we've settled with our Department of Public Works, we've settled with our security monitors, we've settled with a whole host of unions, and there are still a few that we're working on.

331
00:36:44,013 --> 00:36:49,916
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been going through good-faith negotiations with all of our unions.

332
00:36:50,156 --> 00:36:59,680
[SPEAKER_05]: A few were held up due to, once the leadership changed with the Teamsters, we were doing flying with settling contracts, especially over the last couple months.

333
00:37:00,281 --> 00:37:06,244
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think the question, Mark, comes down to the very way you approach the question.

334
00:37:06,444 --> 00:37:11,246
[SPEAKER_05]: It's how do you fund what our employees deserve?

335
00:37:11,686 --> 00:37:13,307
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, if you're in the private sector,

336
00:37:14,568 --> 00:37:16,870
[SPEAKER_05]: There's sometimes more money out there.

337
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:35,246
[SPEAKER_05]: When you're in the city side, you tax to 2.5%, and you have the responsibility of people tugging and pulling from 25 directions, in my case, 25 different departments wanting more, wanting different things in the contract, and I have to be the one to make tough decisions.

338
00:37:35,766 --> 00:37:37,727
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to be the one to do a number of things.

339
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:46,370
[SPEAKER_05]: First, to be fiscally responsible to the people we serve, to treat our employees well, and to be fair to our employees.

340
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:55,113
[SPEAKER_05]: So I had unions at one time asking for, and it wasn't too far away, 9.1 percent a year, where we only taxed at 2.5 percent.

341
00:37:55,693 --> 00:37:58,514
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's important that we take that collective picture

342
00:37:58,954 --> 00:38:01,515
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know, it's an election season.

343
00:38:01,675 --> 00:38:11,440
[SPEAKER_05]: I respect the push that is on me to get additional contracts settled, and all I can say is we're doing it in good faith while trying to be fiscally responsible.

344
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,020
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor, a minute.

345
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:13,821
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

346
00:38:14,261 --> 00:38:19,323
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the mayor is the chief negotiator for our city, not KP Law.

347
00:38:20,203 --> 00:38:25,466
[SPEAKER_00]: The mayor should be at the table at the meetings negotiating, not an outside law firm.

348
00:38:25,866 --> 00:38:26,646
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an issue for me.

349
00:38:29,017 --> 00:38:33,839
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked to teachers, I've talked to policemen, I've talked to firemen, and I've talked to other different groups.

350
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:41,283
[SPEAKER_00]: They're tired of no one from the city showing up to represent them with an outside law firm doing the bulk of the negotiations.

351
00:38:41,943 --> 00:38:43,084
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the chief negotiator.

352
00:38:43,464 --> 00:38:49,427
[SPEAKER_00]: If I am mayor, I will sit there and I will negotiate contracts along with our in-house solicitor.

353
00:38:51,048 --> 00:38:51,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Mayor, you have one minute.

354
00:38:54,987 --> 00:38:57,508
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I'll respond with a compliment.

355
00:38:58,708 --> 00:39:03,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Caraviello is a very nice guy and I don't think it's in him to say no.

356
00:39:04,129 --> 00:39:15,352
[SPEAKER_05]: So negotiation strategies, whether it's sitting at the table every time or sitting in a side room, or sitting in a side room.

357
00:39:15,372 --> 00:39:17,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, okay.

358
00:39:19,913 --> 00:39:22,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Please, don't make my life hard.

359
00:39:28,356 --> 00:39:31,040
[SPEAKER_05]: You have about 40 seconds.

360
00:39:31,581 --> 00:39:32,662
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm always present.

361
00:39:32,962 --> 00:39:40,172
[SPEAKER_05]: I sit usually in a room with my chief of staff, we have our human resource director, and we have an attorney.

362
00:39:40,653 --> 00:39:43,818
[SPEAKER_05]: In my case, we choose to have Copeland and Page

363
00:39:44,218 --> 00:39:48,280
[SPEAKER_05]: who have 40 attorneys on staff that are experts in their field.

364
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:53,103
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the reason why you see Medford moving forward at the rapid pace you do.

365
00:39:53,603 --> 00:40:01,747
[SPEAKER_05]: They're helping planning, they're helping engineering, they're helping the police department, they're helping a number of, all of our departments to get things done.

366
00:40:02,228 --> 00:40:07,490
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm doing my best on a strategy to negotiate in good faith.

367
00:40:07,811 --> 00:40:10,092
[SPEAKER_05]: It shows because we've been able to settle contracts.

368
00:40:10,152 --> 00:40:10,932
[SPEAKER_05]: That's time.

369
00:40:10,952 --> 00:40:11,393
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you.

370
00:40:12,653 --> 00:40:17,476
[SPEAKER_02]: Amory is going to start our lightning round, and this is a 30-second answer each.

371
00:40:18,577 --> 00:40:19,877
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, I've lost track.

372
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Who does it go to?

373
00:40:21,999 --> 00:40:22,359
[SPEAKER_02]: The mayor?

374
00:40:22,459 --> 00:40:23,139
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

375
00:40:23,299 --> 00:40:24,240
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'm not sure, actually.

376
00:40:25,821 --> 00:40:26,061
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

377
00:40:26,261 --> 00:40:26,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Me?

378
00:40:26,701 --> 00:40:28,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we started one, two, three.

379
00:40:28,182 --> 00:40:29,143
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it goes to the mayor.

380
00:40:31,404 --> 00:40:32,285
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

381
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:33,065
[SPEAKER_02]: 30 seconds, remember.

382
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:36,187
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think Medford's greatest challenge is?

383
00:40:39,949 --> 00:40:51,332
[SPEAKER_05]: I've already spoken about housing, so I think our next greatest challenge is infrastructure, from buildings to streets to equipment.

384
00:40:52,112 --> 00:40:55,073
[SPEAKER_05]: It's why we've commissioned a capital improvement plan back in 2021.

385
00:40:55,113 --> 00:40:56,413
[SPEAKER_05]: It was complete in 2022, end of 2021.

386
00:40:56,654 --> 00:40:57,774
[SPEAKER_05]: We just recently updated that plan.

387
00:40:57,814 --> 00:40:58,594
[SPEAKER_05]: It took a year's time.

388
00:41:06,136 --> 00:41:12,122
[SPEAKER_05]: 200 million in needs and hundreds of projects in queue.

389
00:41:12,142 --> 00:41:12,522
[SPEAKER_02]: 30 seconds.

390
00:41:13,383 --> 00:41:14,544
[SPEAKER_02]: 30 seconds, that's right, sorry.

391
00:41:15,465 --> 00:41:19,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor, what do you believe is Medford's greatest challenge in 30 seconds?

392
00:41:20,009 --> 00:41:23,572
[SPEAKER_00]: Our greatest challenge is making Medford affordable for families to live in.

393
00:41:24,352 --> 00:41:28,376
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said earlier, our housing costs are rising.

394
00:41:28,676 --> 00:41:32,578
[SPEAKER_00]: interest rates are rising, and people need to have places to live.

395
00:41:32,818 --> 00:41:43,362
[SPEAKER_00]: We have seniors who need to age in place, and they're struggling to decide whether I pay my rent or my house payments, or do I pay taxes.

396
00:41:43,402 --> 00:41:49,024
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want our seniors to age in place, and I want new families to be able to come here and live.

397
00:41:49,464 --> 00:41:52,986
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also want businesses to move here so their workers can live here also.

398
00:41:58,425 --> 00:42:02,571
[SPEAKER_06]: You have both served in elective office in Medford for a number of years.

399
00:42:03,132 --> 00:42:08,981
[SPEAKER_06]: What one city project or issue are you most proud of that you personally affected in a positive way?

400
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:11,380
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

401
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:12,721
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, that's an easy one.

402
00:42:14,341 --> 00:42:18,122
[SPEAKER_00]: My proudest accomplishment is bringing the library to Medford.

403
00:42:19,022 --> 00:42:27,005
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked probably four years back and forth, finally to get them to come here, and they came, and under Mayor Burke,

404
00:42:28,065 --> 00:42:31,809
[SPEAKER_00]: She agreed to sit down and find the funding to get it done.

405
00:42:32,229 --> 00:42:39,657
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also am proud that I sit on the library foundation to help raise an additional $6 million to help fund that project.

406
00:42:40,077 --> 00:42:43,120
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a sense, in an essence- That's 30 seconds there.

407
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:47,024
[SPEAKER_00]: In an essence, we own that library for almost 50 cents on the dollar, which is a steal.

408
00:42:48,374 --> 00:42:49,575
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my proudest accomplishment.

409
00:42:49,735 --> 00:42:51,456
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor, 30 seconds, proudest accomplishment.

410
00:42:51,636 --> 00:42:52,576
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's hard to pick one.

411
00:42:52,857 --> 00:43:02,602
[SPEAKER_05]: I think back when I was younger, starting a girls hockey team to getting through a global pandemic, creating the plans that need to be put in place to move the city forward.

412
00:43:03,348 --> 00:43:07,132
[SPEAKER_05]: We also have our pride events that we've celebrated the last two years.

413
00:43:07,232 --> 00:43:13,998
[SPEAKER_05]: We have our run Medford events, community aggregation, saving Medford residents a boatload on their bill.

414
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:16,901
[SPEAKER_05]: We've built a team that gets things done.

415
00:43:17,282 --> 00:43:22,327
[SPEAKER_05]: We have work being done on municipal vulnerability preparedness work that I'm very, very proud of.

416
00:43:22,347 --> 00:43:27,772
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Penny, you have a lightning round question?

417
00:43:29,082 --> 00:43:37,088
[SPEAKER_07]: Many Medford residents depend on public transportation, and we all know that the MBTA is having massive problems with commuter rail, subways, and buses.

418
00:43:37,308 --> 00:43:39,610
[SPEAKER_07]: What improvements will you advocate for?

419
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:41,772
[SPEAKER_07]: The mayor.

420
00:43:43,001 --> 00:43:45,882
[SPEAKER_05]: transportation.

421
00:43:46,622 --> 00:43:54,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Representative Barber is working to do an environmental study, pushing to do an environmental study to expand the Green Line.

422
00:43:54,725 --> 00:44:03,048
[SPEAKER_05]: We also want to make sure that the current Green Line that just opened is moving at a speed that our residents deserve.

423
00:44:03,108 --> 00:44:09,510
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we do need to do upgrades, we need to make sure that we have leadership in place to push the T to not only communicate

424
00:44:09,991 --> 00:44:13,218
[SPEAKER_05]: but to make sure our residents and all commuters are safe.

425
00:44:17,751 --> 00:44:23,693
[SPEAKER_00]: As you know, the City of Medford is in the top five or six in what we're assessed for our services.

426
00:44:24,253 --> 00:44:26,314
[SPEAKER_00]: And over the years, we've been getting our services cut.

427
00:44:27,274 --> 00:44:31,996
[SPEAKER_00]: As many of you take the bus to work every day, you see the elimination of bus lines.

428
00:44:32,376 --> 00:44:39,178
[SPEAKER_00]: We now have a new train station at Medford that almost is working now, but the tracks don't work.

429
00:44:39,478 --> 00:44:40,819
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem with that is

430
00:44:41,659 --> 00:44:44,040
[SPEAKER_00]: people that have disabilities have nowhere to park there.

431
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:49,822
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've asked in the last few weeks to make sure that there's handicap parking for people there.

432
00:44:49,842 --> 00:44:50,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

433
00:44:50,983 --> 00:44:54,084
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to go back to regular questions now.

434
00:44:54,184 --> 00:45:00,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Mark, this one goes to the counselor and this is again, a two minute response followed by a two minute response.

435
00:45:03,607 --> 00:45:04,028
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you hear?

436
00:45:04,048 --> 00:45:04,248
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

437
00:45:04,268 --> 00:45:04,588
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

438
00:45:04,628 --> 00:45:04,868
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

439
00:45:05,926 --> 00:45:12,850
[SPEAKER_11]: Bicycles, vehicles, pedestrians all coexist uneasily in Medford.

440
00:45:14,471 --> 00:45:21,475
[SPEAKER_11]: Unsafe driving can be a threat to the safety of people whether they're walking in crosswalks or riding their bicycle.

441
00:45:23,176 --> 00:45:32,241
[SPEAKER_11]: Is the city doing enough to improve safety and what can be done to ensure that those who drive in the city do so safely?

442
00:45:34,031 --> 00:45:34,351
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

443
00:45:34,531 --> 00:45:40,295
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as many of us know, we've just put in some new bike lanes and bump-outs throughout the city.

444
00:45:41,456 --> 00:45:42,417
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both good and bad.

445
00:45:43,718 --> 00:46:03,511
[SPEAKER_00]: They've helped safety, but they've also caused us to have major traffic problems, especially if you live in the West Medford area, you see the traffic in the morning backing up and down to the tracks, into Winchester and into the square because of the rotary that's there, and people can't get onto Route 16 to get to work.

446
00:46:04,371 --> 00:46:05,212
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a giant one.

447
00:46:05,412 --> 00:46:15,578
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think what people don't realize is that part of the problem with that traffic is we have hundreds of thousands of rideshare rides that start in Medford.

448
00:46:15,638 --> 00:46:21,222
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the Mayor can attest to this, that we get paid $0.10 for every rideshare that starts in Medford.

449
00:46:21,242 --> 00:46:25,365
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think last year we had over 300,000 rides that started here.

450
00:46:25,665 --> 00:46:27,246
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're putting cars on the road

451
00:46:27,779 --> 00:46:30,041
[SPEAKER_00]: with people that have no idea what this community is about.

452
00:46:30,061 --> 00:46:34,344
[SPEAKER_00]: They're driving by, their ways, and they're going through communities.

453
00:46:34,364 --> 00:46:35,425
[SPEAKER_00]: You have Grubhub now.

454
00:46:35,706 --> 00:46:37,567
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got Amazon trucks.

455
00:46:37,587 --> 00:46:44,192
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have, it isn't so much coming from our people, it's coming from outside sources that are coming to measure.

456
00:46:44,212 --> 00:46:46,154
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really what we have to look at.

457
00:46:46,955 --> 00:46:51,679
[SPEAKER_00]: We could use more police at certain times of the day, helping with traffic.

458
00:46:52,559 --> 00:47:00,361
[SPEAKER_00]: So, like I said, we've been doing our bike lanes, and I wish more riders would take advantage of the bike lanes because I don't see many people in there.

459
00:47:00,741 --> 00:47:07,742
[SPEAKER_00]: So, again, I think the biggest problem comes from just too many cars on the road and not necessarily from people from MidFed.

460
00:47:09,343 --> 00:47:10,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you mind repeating the question, please?

461
00:47:11,403 --> 00:47:11,803
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, sure.

462
00:47:11,823 --> 00:47:12,143
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

463
00:47:13,024 --> 00:47:14,044
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we were just talking about

464
00:47:16,775 --> 00:47:25,401
[SPEAKER_11]: Cars, bikes, pedestrians all trying to share the road and often doing so in a way that is dangerous.

465
00:47:26,522 --> 00:47:30,124
[SPEAKER_11]: Unsafe driving is a threat to the people who are walking.

466
00:47:30,205 --> 00:47:38,751
[SPEAKER_11]: We get a lot of questions about folks who talk about being panicked about walking downtown and trying to cross the street.

467
00:47:39,912 --> 00:47:41,513
[SPEAKER_11]: and also folks on their bicycles.

468
00:47:42,054 --> 00:47:53,808
[SPEAKER_11]: And the question is, is the city doing enough to improve safety and enforcing whatever can be done to ensure that folks drive safely?

469
00:47:54,807 --> 00:47:55,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

470
00:47:55,107 --> 00:48:00,012
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I agree with the Councilor with regards to trying to get cars off the road.

471
00:48:00,152 --> 00:48:05,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Not only is it going to make things safer, but it's going to help with our climate change issues.

472
00:48:06,238 --> 00:48:10,303
[SPEAKER_05]: What we have in place, and I cannot take credit, is Director Todd Blake.

473
00:48:10,343 --> 00:48:12,284
[SPEAKER_05]: He's Director of Traffic and Transportation.

474
00:48:12,885 --> 00:48:16,489
[SPEAKER_05]: And the work he does on a day-to-day basis for the last five years is

475
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:20,171
[SPEAKER_05]: something you can't even write about.

476
00:48:20,291 --> 00:48:22,651
[SPEAKER_05]: There are 730 streets in the city.

477
00:48:23,071 --> 00:48:24,672
[SPEAKER_05]: There are 16 intersections.

478
00:48:25,112 --> 00:48:31,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Since he's been here, we've updated, with safety improvements, 200 of those intersections.

479
00:48:31,253 --> 00:48:33,994
[SPEAKER_05]: So as you can see, there's a lot done, but there's a lot more to do.

480
00:48:34,674 --> 00:48:39,935
[SPEAKER_05]: We also have been working very hard to create alternate means of transportation.

481
00:48:40,395 --> 00:48:43,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Not only do we have the Green Line that opened, but we have implemented

482
00:48:44,597 --> 00:48:49,200
[SPEAKER_05]: 10 blue bike stations throughout our community and more to come.

483
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:56,286
[SPEAKER_05]: I know Tufts University, I'll give them a shout out, is dedicating, they're gonna donate two to the city of Medford.

484
00:48:56,747 --> 00:49:05,234
[SPEAKER_05]: We also are exploring any and every location for EV charging stations to try to push people to drive hybrid.

485
00:49:05,294 --> 00:49:12,160
[SPEAKER_05]: We're trying to electrify our vehicles as well as a way to help with the climate change issue.

486
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:22,526
[SPEAKER_05]: But transportation, we have drivers, we have walkers, we have people in wheelchairs, people trying to get to school.

487
00:49:23,007 --> 00:49:24,268
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a balance.

488
00:49:24,328 --> 00:49:41,899
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think our traffic commission is doing the best they can to, through Director Blake's advisement, to make sure we accommodate, you know, some parking, but then also make sure we have travel lanes for all means of transportation so that people can get safely to and from work.

489
00:49:42,421 --> 00:49:46,226
[SPEAKER_05]: and we've been doing that work for a long time and we need to continue that work.

490
00:49:46,346 --> 00:49:57,139
[SPEAKER_05]: So you'll see Winthrop Street, South Street, Main Street, Mystic Ave, we have Haines Square, two complete street projects that we're doing, Haines Square and Riverside Ave, and the work's not done.

491
00:49:58,281 --> 00:49:59,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor, one minute.

492
00:49:59,542 --> 00:49:59,843
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

493
00:50:01,718 --> 00:50:02,999
[SPEAKER_00]: your streets can never be safe enough.

494
00:50:03,539 --> 00:50:06,561
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no, there's really no magic cure to get them done.

495
00:50:07,081 --> 00:50:22,491
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we, we have a traffic engineer who needs to look at our, our traffic causing things as we've caused now, because what's happening is people are sitting in traffic, they're being frustrated and now they're going on to our side streets and which makes it even more dangerous.

496
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:27,074
[SPEAKER_00]: And so our side streets are becoming cutthroats, uh, where people, uh,

497
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:31,056
[SPEAKER_00]: are walking to school, and cars are racing through the neighborhood.

498
00:50:31,076 --> 00:50:44,825
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we really need to figure out ways of fixing our traffic, along with getting people to use alternative means of transportation, bicycles, walkers, and things like that.

499
00:50:47,247 --> 00:50:48,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Mayor, one minute for you?

500
00:50:49,368 --> 00:50:49,968
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no follow-up.

501
00:50:51,029 --> 00:50:51,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.

502
00:50:53,071 --> 00:50:53,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Anne Marie?

503
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:59,181
[SPEAKER_01]: What to do about Medford Square is a perennial question.

504
00:50:59,921 --> 00:51:03,463
[SPEAKER_01]: The Chevalier Theatre and Deep Cuts have brought music and entertainment to the square.

505
00:51:03,483 --> 00:51:09,785
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are several good restaurants, including a new one people know as El Tecuba, finally open.

506
00:51:10,746 --> 00:51:14,807
[SPEAKER_01]: But the square can be hard to get around, and business development isn't ideal.

507
00:51:15,608 --> 00:51:20,690
[SPEAKER_01]: What is your vision for Medford Square, and what sort of deadline would you put on that in order to make it happen?

508
00:51:22,399 --> 00:51:23,340
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor, I think that goes for you.

509
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:23,900
[SPEAKER_05]: It's me?

510
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:25,200
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

511
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:27,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Medford Square has been talked about for many, many years.

512
00:51:27,822 --> 00:51:37,266
[SPEAKER_05]: We've had a number of studies done, and I feel like the last study, which took into account what was done in 2017, was that that was done by our planning department.

513
00:51:37,346 --> 00:51:44,449
[SPEAKER_05]: We've partnered with the MAPC, Mass Development, to reimagine our downtown.

514
00:51:44,589 --> 00:51:46,090
[SPEAKER_05]: We have three parcels.

515
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:51,494
[SPEAKER_05]: in Medford Square that we are gonna go out to bid with an RFP on.

516
00:51:51,835 --> 00:52:07,509
[SPEAKER_05]: Now that's after months and months long of communication, surveying, community meetings, listening sessions with all of our residents, especially our seniors at the senior center who have needs, as well as the Chevalier Theater, because it just needs to be done right.

517
00:52:07,869 --> 00:52:11,833
[SPEAKER_05]: So my vision is multi-use on two of those properties,

518
00:52:12,473 --> 00:52:20,035
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to see affordability on housing at all different levels on at least one of the properties, commercial on the bottom floor.

519
00:52:20,535 --> 00:52:26,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you have the parcel, which is in between the Hyatt and City Hall, where we could create some parking.

520
00:52:26,777 --> 00:52:28,737
[SPEAKER_05]: We could create potentially a rec center.

521
00:52:28,797 --> 00:52:30,738
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd love to see a nice restaurant up top.

522
00:52:31,438 --> 00:52:37,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we also have an unactivated riverfront that is going unused.

523
00:52:37,139 --> 00:52:45,302
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've partnered with a consultant and we have created a vision for the waterfront from the senior center all the way down to Sleepy Hollow.

524
00:52:45,782 --> 00:52:48,802
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's important to me that we get that done.

525
00:52:48,822 --> 00:52:59,165
[SPEAKER_05]: I envision, you know, a bear garden and an art mural and a safe place for our children to play and then a dock out to the water with some art floating in the water.

526
00:52:59,665 --> 00:53:03,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you have Sleepy Hollow that definitely needs some updating.

527
00:53:03,487 --> 00:53:12,951
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is so much to do, but we're getting ready to release an RFP for the three parcels, and I hope to see a lot of action on the waterfront by next spring, summer.

528
00:53:13,712 --> 00:53:14,952
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're able to get that done.

529
00:53:14,992 --> 00:53:17,954
[SPEAKER_05]: We've doubled our planning staff since I've taken office.

530
00:53:18,034 --> 00:53:19,094
[SPEAKER_05]: We have the planners.

531
00:53:19,495 --> 00:53:24,377
[SPEAKER_05]: We have the people in place, which Director Hunt leads, to get the job done.

532
00:53:25,848 --> 00:53:26,588
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor, two minutes.

533
00:53:26,928 --> 00:53:27,288
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

534
00:53:27,508 --> 00:53:29,549
[SPEAKER_00]: So we talk about Bedford Square.

535
00:53:30,689 --> 00:53:34,250
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I've been on the council, I've seen multiple plans.

536
00:53:34,690 --> 00:53:35,750
[SPEAKER_00]: They all seem to be the same.

537
00:53:36,110 --> 00:53:42,132
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them going back, I had one that went back to 2003, which is almost identical to the one we're putting out now.

538
00:53:42,612 --> 00:53:49,813
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a waterfront that other cities die for that really isn't talked to about in the plans up until recently.

539
00:53:51,694 --> 00:53:52,254
[SPEAKER_00]: We have housing.

540
00:53:53,547 --> 00:54:01,257
[SPEAKER_00]: that's in the square that could double in size, because the buildings, they're low, and you could get people to move into the square.

541
00:54:01,777 --> 00:54:06,022
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of our problem with our square talk is we always go out to committee.

542
00:54:06,143 --> 00:54:09,326
[SPEAKER_00]: We're always on committee and committee and committee, but we never, ever, ever

543
00:54:09,887 --> 00:54:14,931
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the property owner and say, how can I help you develop your property?

544
00:54:15,151 --> 00:54:15,852
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your vision?

545
00:54:15,872 --> 00:54:16,372
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you want to see?

546
00:54:16,613 --> 00:54:19,255
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody in this room has got great ideas for other people's property.

547
00:54:19,975 --> 00:54:22,577
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk to the property owners and see what they want to do with their property.

548
00:54:22,838 --> 00:54:25,360
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's find out how we can help them develop their property.

549
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:26,400
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's give them some ideas.

550
00:54:26,801 --> 00:54:28,122
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how we invigorate the square.

551
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:34,384
[SPEAKER_00]: I was with my wife over the summer in Melrose Center, and we stopped in the middle of the street, and I said to her, what do you see?

552
00:54:34,725 --> 00:54:35,906
[SPEAKER_00]: And she says, what are you talking about?

553
00:54:35,926 --> 00:54:37,127
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, look, stand in the middle.

554
00:54:37,867 --> 00:54:41,110
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a square lined with trees on both sides.

555
00:54:42,231 --> 00:54:42,892
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at our square.

556
00:54:43,479 --> 00:54:46,301
[SPEAKER_00]: It's full of concrete, it's barren, it's not friendly.

557
00:54:47,022 --> 00:54:48,943
[SPEAKER_00]: I want a warm, inviting square.

558
00:54:49,283 --> 00:54:52,886
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a Catalyst in Chevalier Auditorium that's bringing business in.

559
00:54:53,206 --> 00:54:54,627
[SPEAKER_00]: We finally have a new restaurant open.

560
00:54:55,188 --> 00:55:04,074
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's work with, if we had an economic development working full time, we'd have somebody that maybe could drive some more business into the square so we can get more restaurants and more businesses.

561
00:55:05,055 --> 00:55:06,436
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we really need to do.

562
00:55:08,658 --> 00:55:08,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Mayor?

563
00:55:10,803 --> 00:55:15,348
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll just respond with things do take time.

564
00:55:15,408 --> 00:55:26,058
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been in office a little bit over three years, and I've explained during my opening statement all the plans we put in place, all the work that we've been doing over the last three years.

565
00:55:26,078 --> 00:55:27,960
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it goes unnoticed.

566
00:55:29,301 --> 00:55:36,462
[SPEAKER_05]: by me saying we are at the point where we're gonna put an RFP out for Medford Square, we are at the point.

567
00:55:36,542 --> 00:55:50,525
[SPEAKER_05]: We've done the hard work, the finalized work, and we will be putting out an RFP, we will be activating our waterfront, and thankfully, we do have the people that can get that done, and that's something I'm very proud of.

568
00:55:51,105 --> 00:55:53,586
[SPEAKER_05]: So, thank you.

569
00:55:54,106 --> 00:55:55,366
[SPEAKER_00]: Similar to affordable housing,

570
00:55:56,240 --> 00:56:02,185
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we are, three and a half years later, and now we're starting the process of looking at what we need to do in the square.

571
00:56:02,786 --> 00:56:03,967
[SPEAKER_00]: Should have been started on day one.

572
00:56:03,987 --> 00:56:04,948
[SPEAKER_00]: That should have been a priority.

573
00:56:05,688 --> 00:56:11,794
[SPEAKER_00]: So why we have no development is our own fault because we're not out there trying to pull it in.

574
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:17,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we get to the last question of this half, I just wanted to ask, Council, I'll start with you.

575
00:56:18,764 --> 00:56:22,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Are municipalities trying to discourage people from driving into cities?

576
00:56:22,868 --> 00:56:29,534
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we've got these bike lanes, and one of the biggest complaints we have as reporters and photographers down in Boston is there's nowhere to park anymore.

577
00:56:30,154 --> 00:56:32,076
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is an effect on everything.

578
00:56:33,001 --> 00:56:38,028
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when I was on the council, there was a proposal to put in a parking garage.

579
00:56:38,969 --> 00:56:43,595
[SPEAKER_00]: I was one of the four councilors who supported putting a parking garage in.

580
00:56:43,895 --> 00:56:44,676
[SPEAKER_00]: It needed five votes.

581
00:56:46,499 --> 00:56:47,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Mayor, any thoughts on that?

582
00:56:49,285 --> 00:56:50,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Just repeat the question, sorry.

583
00:56:50,346 --> 00:56:58,672
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just wondering if municipalities are trying to discourage automobile traffic in favor of bicycle traffic and the effect that's having on parking.

584
00:56:59,292 --> 00:57:00,353
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't think so.

585
00:57:00,413 --> 00:57:08,078
[SPEAKER_05]: There's so many people that don't have the means or the ability to ride a bike, so I think it's about creating that balance.

586
00:57:08,358 --> 00:57:16,023
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a project on Winthrop that spans the whole stretch of the street, and our director came up with a plan.

587
00:57:17,064 --> 00:57:17,945
[SPEAKER_05]: People were

588
00:57:18,665 --> 00:57:34,189
[SPEAKER_05]: for the plan, they were against the plan, we were able to, the Traffic Commission was able to tweak it and really think about the different properties that were along the route so that we could create the parking where needed for the American Legion and for our residents that live in the high-rise development.

589
00:57:34,550 --> 00:57:45,593
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's about creating balance and it's about creating a space for all of Medford residents, whether you're walking, whether you're pushing a stroller, riding a bike, driving a car,

590
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:49,514
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to be able to share our roads and share it safely.

591
00:57:49,594 --> 00:57:51,495
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the work we've been doing.

592
00:57:51,515 --> 00:57:54,297
[SPEAKER_05]: And we try to listen to everybody and create that balance.

593
00:57:55,537 --> 00:57:58,499
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have one more question for this half, and then we're going to take a break.

594
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:01,040
[SPEAKER_02]: And who's next?

595
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:01,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan.

596
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:04,242
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, this will be our last question before the break.

597
00:58:04,582 --> 00:58:08,644
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's an issue that has already come up a couple of times in your discussion.

598
00:58:09,324 --> 00:58:14,147
[SPEAKER_06]: But I guess this will give both of you a chance to drill down on it even more specifically.

599
00:58:15,047 --> 00:58:23,952
[SPEAKER_06]: The skyrocketing cost of housing, including rental housing, is making it increasingly difficult for people of modest means to live in Medford.

600
00:58:24,492 --> 00:58:31,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Young people in particular are forced to move farther and farther from Boston in order to find a place they can afford.

601
00:58:32,516 --> 00:58:40,300
[SPEAKER_06]: How can you bring more affordable housing to the city for young people, for seniors, everybody?

602
00:58:41,431 --> 00:58:41,751
[SPEAKER_00]: My question?

603
00:58:42,852 --> 00:58:43,012
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

604
00:58:43,052 --> 00:58:43,352
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

605
00:58:43,592 --> 00:58:47,394
[SPEAKER_00]: So on our current path, Medford is an unaffordable community.

606
00:58:47,814 --> 00:58:53,577
[SPEAKER_00]: You can ask any parent that has a child in daycare or a young family looking for an apartment to rent.

607
00:58:54,158 --> 00:58:58,100
[SPEAKER_00]: We need more affordable housing to support working families.

608
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:01,542
[SPEAKER_00]: Our current administration stopped

609
00:59:02,341 --> 00:59:03,461
[SPEAKER_00]: our 40B projects.

610
00:59:03,581 --> 00:59:12,725
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we can give all the reasons why, but historically, the city does not prevail in those two cases in court, and we spent millions of dollars fighting them.

611
00:59:13,225 --> 00:59:18,647
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also need code enforcement to step up on our short-term rentals.

612
00:59:18,807 --> 00:59:24,488
[SPEAKER_00]: Airbnbs are becoming more and more prevalent in the city, which is becoming a problem.

613
00:59:24,709 --> 00:59:28,990
[SPEAKER_00]: People are taking good units off the market to make them essentially hotels.

614
00:59:29,030 --> 00:59:31,751
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's happening especially up in the Hillside area.

615
00:59:32,051 --> 00:59:36,676
[SPEAKER_00]: But now you're starting to see Airbnbs creeping into the neighborhood.

616
00:59:36,696 --> 00:59:39,600
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two in my neighborhood where I live, of single family.

617
00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:45,406
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're out there, and we have to figure out a way to fix those.

618
00:59:50,066 --> 00:59:54,570
[SPEAKER_00]: We have plans for our affordable housing, and they're a bit away.

619
00:59:55,571 --> 00:59:59,854
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we have a housing plan, but we don't have money to fund the housing plan, and that's a problem.

620
01:00:00,495 --> 01:00:05,239
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we have to look for other means of funding to get more housing to come here.

621
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:12,085
[SPEAKER_00]: And our housing authority is adding apartments on both Riverside Avenue and Walking Court.

622
01:00:14,059 --> 01:00:14,819
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor, two minutes.

623
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:15,600
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

624
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:19,241
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I spent two minutes talking a lot about affordable housing.

625
01:00:19,261 --> 01:00:22,703
[SPEAKER_05]: It was my, I think when the question was asked about the top priority.

626
01:00:22,783 --> 01:00:31,667
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't want to repeat myself, but maybe go into a little bit about the trust and bringing in revenue for the city.

627
01:00:32,248 --> 01:00:38,791
[SPEAKER_05]: And just to set the record straight on a few things, new growth is how we do a lot of things.

628
01:00:38,831 --> 01:00:41,512
[SPEAKER_05]: It's how we increase our budget and how we fund

629
01:00:42,792 --> 01:00:47,295
[SPEAKER_05]: infrastructure needs as well as funds different things that will help with affordable housing.

630
01:00:47,535 --> 01:00:48,495
[SPEAKER_05]: So just some facts.

631
01:00:48,515 --> 01:00:50,096
[SPEAKER_05]: In 2011, we brought in $688,000 in new growth.

632
01:00:54,730 --> 01:00:55,310
[SPEAKER_05]: In 2015, we're at $999,000.

633
01:00:55,350 --> 01:00:56,731
[SPEAKER_05]: New growth was just projected.

634
01:00:56,791 --> 01:00:57,851
[SPEAKER_05]: It's on the DLS website.

635
01:00:57,912 --> 01:01:02,274
[SPEAKER_05]: For fiscal year 24, which is the year we're in, we're projecting $2.75 million in new growth.

636
01:01:02,294 --> 01:01:03,574
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have gone over $2 million

637
01:01:13,979 --> 01:01:19,063
[SPEAKER_05]: for the first time in 2021, and we've gone over three years so far.

638
01:01:19,503 --> 01:01:28,831
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's just something I'm proud of, and it's something that our assessing department and our building department have all worked to make a reality, coupled with our planning department.

639
01:01:29,231 --> 01:01:32,074
[SPEAKER_05]: And what's best about the planning that we're doing and

640
01:01:33,834 --> 01:01:39,595
[SPEAKER_05]: 20, 40 shovels in the ground because you took two years to get to that point.

641
01:01:41,036 --> 01:01:45,957
[SPEAKER_05]: The great thing about it, it is bringing in the new growth and it's not going to stop here.

642
01:01:46,137 --> 01:01:52,818
[SPEAKER_05]: So I had to point that out as something that's important for budgetary purposes.

643
01:01:54,779 --> 01:01:55,079
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

644
01:01:55,419 --> 01:01:56,939
[SPEAKER_00]: So we talk about new growth.

645
01:01:58,560 --> 01:01:59,960
[SPEAKER_00]: Look what's happened around us.

646
01:02:00,799 --> 01:02:03,161
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at Malden, thriving downtown.

647
01:02:03,661 --> 01:02:04,402
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at Somerville.

648
01:02:04,762 --> 01:02:05,343
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at Everett.

649
01:02:07,184 --> 01:02:10,987
[SPEAKER_00]: When did we become the poor sister to Malden and all these other communities?

650
01:02:11,547 --> 01:02:12,368
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's our new growth?

651
01:02:13,129 --> 01:02:16,812
[SPEAKER_00]: We keep talking about new growth, but all we see is little small things.

652
01:02:17,732 --> 01:02:19,654
[SPEAKER_00]: Downtown Malden has got a thriving

653
01:02:20,848 --> 01:02:23,430
[SPEAKER_00]: downtown with housing and restaurants and shopping.

654
01:02:23,730 --> 01:02:24,671
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I want to see here.

655
01:02:24,911 --> 01:02:25,431
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at Everett.

656
01:02:25,911 --> 01:02:27,713
[SPEAKER_00]: Everett finally figured it out.

657
01:02:28,113 --> 01:02:29,734
[SPEAKER_00]: Developers are swarming Everett.

658
01:02:32,076 --> 01:02:33,517
[SPEAKER_00]: They still have cranes in the ground.

659
01:02:33,537 --> 01:02:36,358
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time you turn around, they're building new housing there.

660
01:02:37,659 --> 01:02:38,280
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is ours?

661
01:02:40,001 --> 01:02:40,881
[SPEAKER_00]: We've waited too long.

662
01:02:41,502 --> 01:02:45,044
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a lot of talk, but no action happening here.

663
01:02:45,324 --> 01:02:48,867
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see shovels in the ground over the last three years, and we really haven't seen that.

664
01:02:52,301 --> 01:02:53,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Mayor, you have one minute.

665
01:02:56,834 --> 01:02:59,995
[SPEAKER_05]: This is actually one of the top three reasons I ran in 2020.

666
01:03:00,596 --> 01:03:05,617
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the fact that our commercial tax base was declining, steadily declining.

667
01:03:06,277 --> 01:03:09,838
[SPEAKER_05]: And since I took office, it is now increasing.

668
01:03:10,258 --> 01:03:12,779
[SPEAKER_05]: We also had an issue with public trust.

669
01:03:13,159 --> 01:03:16,740
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a zoning board of appeals that violated open meeting law.

670
01:03:16,940 --> 01:03:18,160
[SPEAKER_05]: They ended up resigning.

671
01:03:18,681 --> 01:03:23,602
[SPEAKER_05]: And over the first year in my term, while going through a pandemic, we were building that trust back.

672
01:03:24,202 --> 01:03:33,711
[SPEAKER_05]: As I met with developers, with our planning team and our economic development team, we sat with them and we said, please, just have a community meeting.

673
01:03:33,811 --> 01:03:37,755
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to build trust back among our residents, and that's what we do every time.

674
01:03:38,356 --> 01:03:45,282
[SPEAKER_05]: So the 20 or 30 properties, including the eight-story life science complex that's going above the Bertucci site,

675
01:03:46,503 --> 01:03:50,285
[SPEAKER_05]: It's finally out of a court with a neighbor, and that is moving forward.

676
01:03:50,325 --> 01:03:55,508
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just one of tens and 20, 30 different projects that we are moving forward.

677
01:03:55,628 --> 01:03:56,568
[SPEAKER_05]: It takes time.

678
01:03:58,829 --> 01:04:01,511
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not something I could fix overnight with the snap of a finger.

679
01:04:01,811 --> 01:04:03,612
[SPEAKER_05]: But we're doing it right, and we're going to continue to do it.

680
01:04:03,632 --> 01:04:04,152
[SPEAKER_02]: All in 30 seconds.

681
01:04:06,073 --> 01:04:07,314
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

682
01:04:07,414 --> 01:04:10,415
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is the last question of the first half.

683
01:04:10,595 --> 01:04:11,776
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to take a 10-minute break.

684
01:04:11,816 --> 01:04:12,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you both.

685
01:04:13,177 --> 01:04:14,977
[SPEAKER_02]: And you will be back, and I will too.

686
01:04:15,058 --> 01:04:15,778
[SPEAKER_02]: So 10-minute break.

687
01:07:44,645 --> 01:07:44,927
Yeah.

688
01:09:32,652 --> 01:09:33,092
Thank you.

689
01:10:04,338 --> 01:10:04,398
you

690
01:11:38,131 --> 01:11:38,253
you

691
01:16:01,138 --> 01:16:07,104
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's like, once you get past Sherbourne, things start to drop off a little bit, price-wise.

692
01:16:07,204 --> 01:16:08,445
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's still expensive.

693
01:16:08,545 --> 01:16:11,988
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, how do people afford to, if you were thinking about buying a house?

694
01:16:12,028 --> 01:16:13,610
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how they do it.

695
01:16:13,730 --> 01:16:15,291
[SPEAKER_02]: It's huge.

696
01:16:15,692 --> 01:16:16,452
[SPEAKER_02]: It's discouraging.

697
01:16:19,655 --> 01:16:21,816
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

698
01:16:21,956 --> 01:16:32,740
[SPEAKER_02]: If we had lived in Georgia, where we were after the Olympics, the market picked up, and we were in the house, we'd never have been able to come out here.

699
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:33,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Never.

700
01:16:33,641 --> 01:16:33,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Never.

701
01:16:33,901 --> 01:16:35,821
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just amazing.

702
01:16:35,841 --> 01:16:42,064
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, my cousin just moved down to Georgia.

703
01:16:42,164 --> 01:16:44,325
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, really?

704
01:17:00,239 --> 01:17:02,219
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we're going to get started with the second half.

705
01:17:03,220 --> 01:17:05,280
[SPEAKER_02]: If everybody could have a seat, please.

706
01:17:11,461 --> 01:17:12,802
[SPEAKER_02]: I forget who goes next.

707
01:17:13,162 --> 01:17:13,702
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you next?

708
01:17:13,742 --> 01:17:14,202
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you are.

709
01:17:27,910 --> 01:17:29,271
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, thank you very much.

710
01:17:31,092 --> 01:17:40,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Just want to remind you all, I know it's great to have an excited electorate, but if we could just tone it down, no catcalls and hissing and that kind of stuff.

711
01:17:41,718 --> 01:17:45,220
[SPEAKER_02]: It just takes up time, and it's also just not really appropriate.

712
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:47,101
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you for doing that.

713
01:17:48,242 --> 01:17:48,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan, are you next?

714
01:17:49,963 --> 01:17:51,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

715
01:17:51,143 --> 01:17:55,126
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have a regular question, so this will be one of our two-minute questions, and this goes to the mayor.

716
01:17:56,610 --> 01:18:05,937
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, the city's charter has not been updated in many years and currently there is a committee studying possible changes to Medford's governing document.

717
01:18:06,137 --> 01:18:08,678
[SPEAKER_07]: Will you support the recommendations of the charter committee?

718
01:18:09,099 --> 01:18:12,121
[SPEAKER_07]: What are the changes that you would like to most like to see?

719
01:18:12,998 --> 01:18:13,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Penny.

720
01:18:14,299 --> 01:18:16,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Charter review is extremely important.

721
01:18:16,601 --> 01:18:20,524
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a 40-plus-year-old charter.

722
01:18:20,604 --> 01:18:22,045
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about a page and a half.

723
01:18:22,426 --> 01:18:28,351
[SPEAKER_05]: It only references the male gender and to name another whole host of other issues with the charter.

724
01:18:28,471 --> 01:18:33,995
[SPEAKER_05]: So early on, I committed to doing charter review as a counselor.

725
01:18:34,015 --> 01:18:36,537
[SPEAKER_05]: It was proposed by Councilor Marks in 2016, and I was one of four.

726
01:18:38,739 --> 01:18:40,080
[SPEAKER_05]: that approved charter review.

727
01:18:40,581 --> 01:18:47,246
[SPEAKER_05]: I then put it forward to the city council twice during my first year and a half.

728
01:18:47,567 --> 01:18:52,331
[SPEAKER_05]: I thank the four that voted to move forward with the charter.

729
01:18:52,471 --> 01:18:59,697
[SPEAKER_05]: It just wasn't enough in the state house to get it moved through that way, so I chose another way and we commissioned

730
01:19:00,357 --> 01:19:26,276
[SPEAKER_05]: a task force of 11 capable individuals, Medford residents, led by our chair, Milva, to create, it's gonna take 12 to 18 months, but we're already deep in, at least halfway through, and we've done, we have a community survey out now that's due in December, it's open for many months, so that we can get as much input from our business owners, our residents,

731
01:19:27,456 --> 01:19:43,342
[SPEAKER_05]: in the city, and it's exploring everything that has to do with our charter, including term limits, ward representation, how many members should be on the council, should there be at-large members, and a number of those things I do support.

732
01:19:43,362 --> 01:19:47,623
[SPEAKER_05]: I was interviewed for the Charter Commission, and it was very basic for me.

733
01:19:48,063 --> 01:19:49,084
[SPEAKER_05]: What do the people want?

734
01:19:50,104 --> 01:19:52,267
[SPEAKER_05]: What do the people want to see in our government?

735
01:19:52,587 --> 01:19:55,590
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we can figure that out, I will support it.

736
01:19:55,730 --> 01:19:56,130
[SPEAKER_05]: And I do.

737
01:19:56,211 --> 01:19:57,232
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to see term limits.

738
01:19:57,272 --> 01:19:58,333
[SPEAKER_05]: I've said that for years.

739
01:19:58,433 --> 01:19:59,414
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to see term limits.

740
01:20:00,014 --> 01:20:04,699
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see what happens when somebody's been in office for 30 years, and that needs to change.

741
01:20:04,979 --> 01:20:05,460
[SPEAKER_05]: So, thank you.

742
01:20:07,048 --> 01:20:07,748
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilor, two minutes.

743
01:20:08,368 --> 01:20:11,609
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was one of the last two interviewed for the charter.

744
01:20:11,889 --> 01:20:19,271
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of my concerns for the charter committee was we made up a committee that did not reflect the community.

745
01:20:19,911 --> 01:20:21,751
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no one of color on the community.

746
01:20:22,191 --> 01:20:26,052
[SPEAKER_00]: Our largest growing population in the city of Mephit is Asian.

747
01:20:26,072 --> 01:20:30,253
[SPEAKER_00]: There was nobody from the Asian people there, nobody from the Haitian community.

748
01:20:30,273 --> 01:20:32,634
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a bunch of all white people.

749
01:20:33,633 --> 01:20:35,534
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not what our community is made up of.

750
01:20:35,774 --> 01:20:42,619
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a diverse community and we didn't learn from the mistakes we made when we changed the name of the Columbus School to the Mississippi Tech School.

751
01:20:42,899 --> 01:20:45,580
[SPEAKER_00]: We put a committee together that didn't reflect the community.

752
01:20:47,041 --> 01:20:49,783
[SPEAKER_00]: So my opinion of the charter change, that's the will of the people.

753
01:20:49,863 --> 01:20:51,884
[SPEAKER_00]: If the people want the charter change, so be it.

754
01:20:53,405 --> 01:20:59,109
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I talked about in my interview was I thought that the council should have more power that they don't have.

755
01:21:00,350 --> 01:21:03,351
[SPEAKER_00]: I, for one, am not a proponent of ward representation.

756
01:21:03,371 --> 01:21:06,072
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you get bigger governments and less representation.

757
01:21:06,793 --> 01:21:08,853
[SPEAKER_00]: So childhood change does need to happen.

758
01:21:08,993 --> 01:21:12,235
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a long way away, and it's a long process.

759
01:21:12,275 --> 01:21:18,977
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think if we had a more diverse community, we would have got better questions than what we got.

760
01:21:20,378 --> 01:21:20,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Mayor, one minute.

761
01:21:21,451 --> 01:21:21,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

762
01:21:21,892 --> 01:21:33,006
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's clear with my vote in 2016, the fact that I put it before the council twice, and the fact that I put a committee together to do it another way, that I am for charter change.

763
01:21:33,547 --> 01:21:35,410
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't believe my council colleague

764
01:21:36,531 --> 01:21:41,836
[SPEAKER_05]: to my left, has supported charter change on the council those three times, so I just want that to be clear.

765
01:21:42,617 --> 01:21:50,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Secondly, we have hundreds of people serving on our boards and commissions, and my number one priority is diversity.

766
01:21:52,086 --> 01:21:57,451
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to also take in what was before me as far as who applied.

767
01:21:58,892 --> 01:22:03,075
[SPEAKER_05]: And you also have to remember that diversity is not just about the color of somebody's skin.

768
01:22:03,636 --> 01:22:06,638
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about LGBTQ, disabled.

769
01:22:07,799 --> 01:22:13,103
[SPEAKER_05]: It has a whole host of things that we need to think about and review when putting a committee together.

770
01:22:13,483 --> 01:22:15,104
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm proud of the committee we put together.

771
01:22:15,184 --> 01:22:24,571
[SPEAKER_05]: I know two of, one is running for city council, one got a job in Medford, thankfully, and we have replaced those members, and those replacements are also diverse.

772
01:22:25,572 --> 01:22:26,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilwoman.

773
01:22:26,132 --> 01:22:26,372
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

774
01:22:28,496 --> 01:22:31,017
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned all the diversity on the Charter Convention.

775
01:22:31,317 --> 01:22:34,878
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I didn't see those members in the group there.

776
01:22:35,298 --> 01:22:41,940
[SPEAKER_00]: So I apologize if I spoke out of turn, but that wasn't the group that I seemed to interview with.

777
01:22:44,081 --> 01:22:44,361
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

778
01:22:45,982 --> 01:22:50,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Mark, a two-minute question for the counselor.

779
01:22:52,382 --> 01:23:13,064
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so this is certainly not an issue that's unique to Medford, but there have been several acts of violence at Medford High School, and I guess we're wondering what is the best way to handle those incidents and perhaps even to prevent them?

780
01:23:14,415 --> 01:23:25,681
[SPEAKER_11]: And what role should the police play, especially given that some people find the presence of police in schools to be controversial?

781
01:23:26,502 --> 01:23:26,862
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

782
01:23:28,823 --> 01:23:42,271
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, as a parent, when you send your child to school in the morning, the last thing you want to get is a phone call saying that your child was assaulted or something is happening in school.

783
01:23:44,286 --> 01:23:46,367
[SPEAKER_00]: Our children need to be in safe environments.

784
01:23:47,828 --> 01:23:52,531
[SPEAKER_00]: We have gotten better, but we're not good enough.

785
01:23:53,532 --> 01:24:00,196
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the opportunity to speak at the school last week, and the students themselves had concerns about their safety.

786
01:24:01,717 --> 01:24:05,699
[SPEAKER_00]: The schools don't have enough resources to address safety.

787
01:24:06,747 --> 01:24:09,048
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel this law enforcement should be in the building.

788
01:24:09,769 --> 01:24:20,394
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we've had them there before, whether it be the deer officer or somebody, but, um, we can't depend on the teachers to be a teacher and to be a hall monitor and to be a policeman.

789
01:24:20,635 --> 01:24:26,678
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, we have to figure out a better way to get our hallways and buildings safe.

790
01:24:26,718 --> 01:24:34,402
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I think, uh, having a policeman there is, is a good thing because it's a, it's just law enforcement is the way to go.

791
01:24:36,806 --> 01:24:37,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Two minutes.

792
01:24:37,466 --> 01:24:37,667
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

793
01:24:39,288 --> 01:24:43,590
[SPEAKER_05]: The safety of our students is our number one priority.

794
01:24:43,771 --> 01:24:51,836
[SPEAKER_05]: So when that incident happened at the high school, I think the first thing that we had to do was listen to our students.

795
01:24:51,916 --> 01:24:57,700
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was lucky to have a number walk on over to City Hall, and I welcomed them in.

796
01:24:57,740 --> 01:24:59,381
[SPEAKER_05]: And for three hours, we discussed

797
01:25:00,121 --> 01:25:03,603
[SPEAKER_05]: everything from A to Z as it relates to Medford High School.

798
01:25:04,283 --> 01:25:15,908
[SPEAKER_05]: We then had the superintendent and the leadership created, not only did a survey go out in the spring to learn more, but we had listening sessions at the high school that I also went to.

799
01:25:16,768 --> 01:25:19,290
[SPEAKER_05]: It was important to assess leadership.

800
01:25:19,571 --> 01:25:26,356
[SPEAKER_05]: It was important to assess the handbook and the rules and how they were being administrated and followed.

801
01:25:26,376 --> 01:25:32,641
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm very happy and have very high hopes for the new principal of the high school, Ms.

802
01:25:32,681 --> 01:25:33,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Cabral.

803
01:25:33,242 --> 01:25:40,428
[SPEAKER_05]: She seems to be creating, making sure that handbook is fulfilled, and I think it's creating a great atmosphere.

804
01:25:40,908 --> 01:25:45,749
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's not to say that we didn't necessarily have good leadership.

805
01:25:45,869 --> 01:25:50,951
[SPEAKER_05]: It's that we had a global pandemic where our students' lives were turned upside down.

806
01:25:51,731 --> 01:25:58,033
[SPEAKER_05]: Our students were the ones that suffered the most, from mental health to being isolated in their homes.

807
01:25:58,693 --> 01:26:01,474
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's something that we need to deal with.

808
01:26:01,574 --> 01:26:05,335
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been able to hire staff and social workers and guidance counselors.

809
01:26:05,775 --> 01:26:09,876
[SPEAKER_05]: We put a 10-point plan in place, led by our superintendent of schools.

810
01:26:10,696 --> 01:26:15,197
[SPEAKER_05]: to create a safe environment the best way we could right after that incident.

811
01:26:15,357 --> 01:26:21,298
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's, it's been, we've been successful and we're gonna keep making sure we make security upgrades.

812
01:26:21,418 --> 01:26:25,579
[SPEAKER_05]: I've commissioned a team, city and school staff, to make sure that gets done.

813
01:26:26,259 --> 01:26:29,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Now the team at City Hall is, wheels are turning pretty fast.

814
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:35,000
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a lot that still needs to be done and that just has to be our top priority, safety of our students.

815
01:26:35,821 --> 01:26:36,481
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilor, one minute.

816
01:26:36,521 --> 01:26:36,781
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

817
01:26:38,598 --> 01:26:51,726
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a handbook in place for years, and it took a grave accident for the school to start using the handbook, which to me is a little disheartening.

818
01:26:52,787 --> 01:26:54,108
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's our superintendent in this?

819
01:26:55,428 --> 01:27:00,812
[SPEAKER_00]: Why wasn't our superintendent held accountable when a young woman was beat?

820
01:27:01,512 --> 01:27:05,895
[SPEAKER_00]: Where was our superintendent when someone got stabbed in the bathroom?

821
01:27:07,714 --> 01:27:09,297
[SPEAKER_00]: we need better leadership at our school.

822
01:27:09,998 --> 01:27:13,183
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that will be a top priority of mine.

823
01:27:17,711 --> 01:27:18,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Mayor, one minute.

824
01:27:22,338 --> 01:27:31,722
[SPEAKER_05]: To respond to that, I don't think anybody does a perfect job at anything, but I take just offense to treating our superintendent that way.

825
01:27:32,962 --> 01:27:38,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Our superintendent has great skills, and she cares about our students.

826
01:27:39,205 --> 01:27:43,426
[SPEAKER_05]: What we dealt with before her was on a whole other level.

827
01:27:43,966 --> 01:27:47,828
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Maurice Edward Vincent cares about our students, and you said

828
01:27:49,568 --> 01:27:52,070
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think we can blame the principal either.

829
01:27:52,190 --> 01:28:01,335
[SPEAKER_05]: He was, which I think is what you did, but the current principal was leading a student body of 1,100 that just went through a global pandemic.

830
01:28:01,855 --> 01:28:02,996
[SPEAKER_05]: Our students are suffering.

831
01:28:03,036 --> 01:28:03,736
[SPEAKER_05]: They still are.

832
01:28:04,136 --> 01:28:06,398
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why we have the extra supports in our schools.

833
01:28:06,858 --> 01:28:08,779
[SPEAKER_05]: And not one person was to blame.

834
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:17,804
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to take responsibility as parents, as educators, as principals and administrators, and as a superintendent.

835
01:28:18,764 --> 01:28:19,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody was to blame.

836
01:28:19,905 --> 01:28:23,366
[SPEAKER_05]: That incident was an unfortunate, awful incident.

837
01:28:23,686 --> 01:28:30,388
[SPEAKER_05]: They were in the bathroom, they were kicked out of the bathroom, and then when the monitors walked away, they were back in the bathroom.

838
01:28:31,049 --> 01:28:33,429
[SPEAKER_05]: It was an awful, awful situation.

839
01:28:35,130 --> 01:28:37,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Anne Marie, you have a question for the mayor for two minutes.

840
01:28:40,171 --> 01:28:44,013
[SPEAKER_01]: The state and the city are in the early stages of reimagining Wellington Circle.

841
01:28:44,773 --> 01:28:50,736
[SPEAKER_01]: What is your vision for how that would be done in a way that will make that area vibrant economically as well as safe?

842
01:28:51,737 --> 01:28:54,538
[SPEAKER_01]: And how would you handle the air rights over Wellington Station?

843
01:28:56,755 --> 01:28:57,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for the question.

844
01:28:57,735 --> 01:28:58,896
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a great question.

845
01:28:58,936 --> 01:29:03,958
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it goes along the lines of what we've been doing for economic development and new growth.

846
01:29:04,738 --> 01:29:11,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Two years ago, we commissioned a consultant along with our economic development director to review the air rights.

847
01:29:11,821 --> 01:29:15,082
[SPEAKER_05]: We own 28 acres above the Wellington T stop.

848
01:29:15,522 --> 01:29:19,806
[SPEAKER_05]: It was, we've had these air rights since the 60s and nothing was ever done.

849
01:29:20,366 --> 01:29:33,437
[SPEAKER_05]: So we commissioned an RFI, request for information, and we were able to solicit, it was months long, but we were able to solicit eight developers that came forward with their plans and ideas.

850
01:29:33,677 --> 01:29:35,459
[SPEAKER_05]: All can be reviewed in our city website.

851
01:29:36,119 --> 01:29:47,048
[SPEAKER_05]: And what we're doing now is we went out to bid with an RFP to hire a consultant so we can do an RFP for the air rights.

852
01:29:47,608 --> 01:30:01,299
[SPEAKER_05]: I envision multi-use, all levels of affordability, retail, restaurants, potential hotel on that site, working with the T building on that property.

853
01:30:03,404 --> 01:30:03,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, thank you.

854
01:30:04,505 --> 01:30:07,669
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't remember the second part of the question now that I... Thank you.

855
01:30:08,510 --> 01:30:10,852
[SPEAKER_00]: Believe it or not, I share the same vision as the mayor in that question.

856
01:30:12,654 --> 01:30:19,622
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a project that Jack McGlynn did way back in, I think, the 70s when the T bought the station.

857
01:30:19,962 --> 01:30:23,366
[SPEAKER_00]: He had the foresight to keep the air rights.

858
01:30:25,041 --> 01:30:28,423
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody knew what they were back then, but now they've turned into something valuable.

859
01:30:30,584 --> 01:30:34,606
[SPEAKER_00]: There are obstacles to go with the air rights as far as building on top there.

860
01:30:35,227 --> 01:30:37,968
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked to the developers and they've given me some of their concerns.

861
01:30:38,769 --> 01:30:47,133
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the T is going to fight us on that because they want to keep that space for their electric bus repair station.

862
01:30:48,914 --> 01:30:50,355
[SPEAKER_00]: The mayor and I do share that vision.

863
01:30:50,915 --> 01:30:51,495
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same thing.

864
01:30:51,955 --> 01:30:52,955
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to see some growth there.

865
01:30:52,975 --> 01:30:53,996
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to see some housing.

866
01:30:54,036 --> 01:30:55,376
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to see restaurants.

867
01:30:57,557 --> 01:30:59,758
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to see what Somerville has next door to us.

868
01:30:59,958 --> 01:31:01,358
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to see what Malden has.

869
01:31:01,758 --> 01:31:04,379
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know you think we don't.

870
01:31:04,439 --> 01:31:04,699
[SPEAKER_00]: We do.

871
01:31:04,879 --> 01:31:06,040
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do agree on a lot of things.

872
01:31:06,240 --> 01:31:06,920
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is one of them.

873
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:09,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Mayor, I cut you at one minute.

874
01:31:10,141 --> 01:31:11,641
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounded like you were ready to go on.

875
01:31:12,702 --> 01:31:13,122
[SPEAKER_02]: One minute, yes.

876
01:31:21,861 --> 01:31:30,646
[SPEAKER_05]: We also have the MBTA Communities Act that we need to comply with, and we are complying, and that's extremely important.

877
01:31:30,666 --> 01:31:31,406
[SPEAKER_05]: We've done the work.

878
01:31:31,466 --> 01:31:32,887
[SPEAKER_05]: We have the planners in place.

879
01:31:33,427 --> 01:31:37,510
[SPEAKER_05]: I know Danielle Evans and Director Hunt have been working on this diligently.

880
01:31:39,132 --> 01:31:48,043
[SPEAKER_05]: through the MBTA Communities Act, we have to create thousands of units next to transit.

881
01:31:48,123 --> 01:31:52,368
[SPEAKER_05]: So the Wellington location is the perfect spot to do that.

882
01:31:52,428 --> 01:31:56,714
[SPEAKER_05]: So between going out to bid with an RFP for those air rights,

883
01:31:57,394 --> 01:32:04,019
[SPEAKER_05]: and complying with this MBTA Communities Act, we'll be able to really revitalize and redevelop that area.

884
01:32:04,219 --> 01:32:10,604
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, community input and community meetings will be powder that as it always was.

885
01:32:11,084 --> 01:32:14,626
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll just add, this is work we've been doing over the three years.

886
01:32:15,207 --> 01:32:18,969
[SPEAKER_05]: Malden and Everett, and Somerville started 30 years ago, and you're seeing it.

887
01:32:19,690 --> 01:32:22,992
[SPEAKER_05]: Everett, Malden started 10 years ago, and now you're seeing it.

888
01:32:23,412 --> 01:32:25,474
[SPEAKER_05]: I've started three years ago, and you're seeing it.

889
01:32:29,861 --> 01:32:30,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor, you have a minute.

890
01:32:31,425 --> 01:32:31,765
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

891
01:32:33,109 --> 01:32:37,599
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the common denominator between Medford, Everett, Malden, and Somerville?

892
01:32:38,510 --> 01:32:43,353
[SPEAKER_00]: They have an outstanding economic development director who drives business into the city.

893
01:32:44,334 --> 01:32:53,220
[SPEAKER_00]: We did have one in Victor Schrader, but he was gone in a short period of time, which decided me that I thought that was a good hire by you, but I'm very disappointed that he left.

894
01:32:54,601 --> 01:32:56,783
[SPEAKER_00]: I was there for the opening.

895
01:32:57,103 --> 01:33:00,886
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be a bridge going over the water for more bike lanes.

896
01:33:01,466 --> 01:33:05,268
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the obstacles we also have to talk about is the traffic at Wellington Circle.

897
01:33:05,828 --> 01:33:09,049
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of cars, Route 16, Route 28.

898
01:33:09,449 --> 01:33:14,591
[SPEAKER_00]: You get two major highways all coming together in one spot.

899
01:33:14,811 --> 01:33:16,192
[SPEAKER_00]: So the building is going to be great.

900
01:33:16,532 --> 01:33:20,334
[SPEAKER_00]: I do share the mayor's vision, but there are obstacles that we do need to overcome.

901
01:33:20,654 --> 01:33:25,416
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them is bringing in our economic development director on a full-time basis.

902
01:33:26,616 --> 01:33:31,301
[SPEAKER_02]: So the next question is lightning round, the next couple of questions, which is the 30 seconds for each.

903
01:33:31,562 --> 01:33:34,525
[SPEAKER_02]: And Dan, that would be first one will go to the counselor.

904
01:33:35,626 --> 01:33:40,832
[SPEAKER_06]: My question is, what can you do to improve relations between the mayor and the city council?

905
01:33:43,519 --> 01:33:51,986
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, well, I'm going to tell you as a city councilor, I believe that the mayor should meet with us on a regular basis.

906
01:33:52,226 --> 01:33:58,951
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not something that this mayor has done, but this goes back to my first day in the council.

907
01:33:59,511 --> 01:34:09,659
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought we should meet once a month so the council is informed and we know what's going on and we need more communication and we need more transparency between the council and the mayor's office.

908
01:34:09,879 --> 01:34:11,941
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now, we're not getting that.

909
01:34:13,423 --> 01:34:13,964
[SPEAKER_05]: 30 seconds mayor.

910
01:34:14,665 --> 01:34:14,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

911
01:34:16,527 --> 01:34:27,882
[SPEAKER_05]: For quite some time I did meet with the president and vice president monthly and I do try to present the budget and present different things, go once in a while to the council.

912
01:34:29,003 --> 01:34:30,544
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a tough political environment.

913
01:34:30,804 --> 01:34:38,408
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish I had the answers, but what we're going to do with regards to budgeting and council relationships, we're going to start meeting again.

914
01:34:38,428 --> 01:34:43,171
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a meeting next week, and it's important that we try to collaborate.

915
01:34:43,231 --> 01:34:46,933
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have been collaborating, even if I don't attend every single meeting.

916
01:34:49,001 --> 01:34:52,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Penny, a lightning round question for the mayor.

917
01:34:53,104 --> 01:34:53,424
[SPEAKER_02]: 30 seconds.

918
01:34:54,065 --> 01:34:58,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Gasoline-powered leaf blowers are a significant contributor to noise and air pollution.

919
01:34:59,028 --> 01:35:01,530
[SPEAKER_07]: Should the city ban or limit their use?

920
01:35:04,132 --> 01:35:15,401
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you have to, again, balance the need of local landscapers with the noise element and pollution element, so I think maybe

921
01:35:16,642 --> 01:35:24,990
[SPEAKER_05]: either doing time frames or staggering it out where they would have to go electric in hopes that there would be less noise would be the answer.

922
01:35:26,071 --> 01:35:37,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Let landscapers get new equipment over a three or five year time frame while limiting potential hours or seasons would probably be the best answer the council will decide on.

923
01:35:38,188 --> 01:35:39,369
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

924
01:35:40,691 --> 01:35:42,954
[SPEAKER_00]: Gas blowers versus electric.

925
01:35:43,294 --> 01:35:49,982
[SPEAKER_00]: If you talk to the landscapers, they'll tell you that electric does not do the job that the gas does.

926
01:35:53,027 --> 01:35:53,527
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.

927
01:35:53,688 --> 01:35:59,512
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we maybe should set some timeframes of when, uh, gas blowers should be used.

928
01:35:59,992 --> 01:36:07,578
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if you talk to the landscapers, they'll tell you that your cost of landscaping is going to go up drastically if they don't have the use of the, the leaf blower.

929
01:36:07,999 --> 01:36:15,124
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you see them in many houses, uh, they're in there and five guys come in there and they're out there like in five, 10 minutes, cause they blew everything away.

930
01:36:15,564 --> 01:36:20,068
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, otherwise they're going to be staying with breaks and everyone's cost of landscaping is going to go up.

931
01:36:21,474 --> 01:36:24,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Mark, a question for the counselor, a 30-second question.

932
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:33,488
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you tell us what is the personal quality that you possess that makes you an effective leader?

933
01:36:33,508 --> 01:36:34,809
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry?

934
01:36:35,590 --> 01:36:41,397
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you name, can you identify the personal quality that you possess that makes you an effective leader?

935
01:36:42,366 --> 01:36:43,347
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

936
01:36:43,807 --> 01:36:47,970
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you look at my resume, I'm a small business owner.

937
01:36:49,351 --> 01:36:50,332
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran a union business.

938
01:36:51,533 --> 01:36:53,654
[SPEAKER_00]: I negotiated union contracts many years ago.

939
01:36:54,835 --> 01:37:05,343
[SPEAKER_00]: If you continue on my resume, you'll see that I've led many organizations in this community, along with being the executive director and president of this chamber that's hosting this debate tonight.

940
01:37:05,363 --> 01:37:09,566
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been president of a youth hockey association that had over 900 kids in it.

941
01:37:11,002 --> 01:37:15,965
[SPEAKER_00]: I currently chair the Massachusetts Mitigation Committee for the Gaming Commission, which I'm the chairman.

942
01:37:15,985 --> 01:37:16,465
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Councilor.

943
01:37:16,485 --> 01:37:17,026
[SPEAKER_02]: That's 30 seconds.

944
01:37:17,446 --> 01:37:17,706
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor?

945
01:37:19,867 --> 01:37:34,976
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's a number of qualities you need as mayor, but I think having integrity is probably one of the top, and integrity leads to being fair to all, being fair to all of our employees.

946
01:37:35,696 --> 01:37:55,342
[SPEAKER_05]: being fair and making sure every developer has a seat at the table, not just a select few, being fair to our residents, listening to all, making sure like streets and sidewalks, we don't just do a sidewalk because we know somebody, we do a sidewalk because we did an assessment and that outlined how we get the work done.

947
01:37:56,570 --> 01:38:00,273
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, next one is a regular question, so that's the two-minute question plus rebuttal.

948
01:38:00,433 --> 01:38:01,353
[SPEAKER_02]: And Anne-Marie.

949
01:38:03,435 --> 01:38:08,619
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy to look at climate change as a global issue, and that needs to be solved on a global basis.

950
01:38:09,659 --> 01:38:13,142
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are steps that local communities can take as well.

951
01:38:13,702 --> 01:38:17,365
[SPEAKER_01]: What efforts will you undertake to address the climate crisis?

952
01:38:19,093 --> 01:38:21,394
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor, two minutes.

953
01:38:21,514 --> 01:38:24,836
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we have a climate crisis on our hands.

954
01:38:24,916 --> 01:38:26,537
[SPEAKER_05]: We all see it in the news every day.

955
01:38:26,557 --> 01:38:34,822
[SPEAKER_05]: It happens close to home now, too, with what we saw over the last month, especially in Lemonster and Andover.

956
01:38:35,502 --> 01:38:41,406
[SPEAKER_05]: But what we've done is we did a climate action and adaptation plan back in 2022.

957
01:38:41,446 --> 01:38:43,387
[SPEAKER_05]: It outlines 32 strategies and four focus areas.

958
01:38:47,129 --> 01:39:05,484
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have been actively, while it was being prepared and continuing to this day, and we need to continue it into the future, we've been actively initiating that from transportation to our municipal vulnerability preparedness work, composting contract that we signed, our recycling contract.

959
01:39:06,124 --> 01:39:06,665
[SPEAKER_05]: We also have a

960
01:39:07,305 --> 01:39:20,576
[SPEAKER_05]: textile contract with help see But I think the most important part of this this work as well as electrifying and making sure we start buying hybrid vehicles Which we we've done Is the work that we're putting in?

961
01:39:21,497 --> 01:39:30,964
[SPEAKER_05]: To make sure that all residents know what's going on that we're able to communicate with all residents we were able to secure $400,000 for municipal vulnerability

962
01:39:33,406 --> 01:39:34,007
[SPEAKER_05]: preparedness.

963
01:39:34,067 --> 01:39:45,937
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a grant that has come in and through some ARPA funding we've been able to hire over 10 community liaisons and connectors and those liaisons and connectors speak other languages.

964
01:39:46,178 --> 01:39:49,861
[SPEAKER_05]: It's something the city's never had before and it's something that we so desperately needed.

965
01:39:50,301 --> 01:39:53,224
[SPEAKER_05]: We are able to reach all communities

966
01:39:53,612 --> 01:40:00,658
[SPEAKER_05]: We are able to translate things, we're able to find out what the needs are, and we're able to prepare to be resilient in the future.

967
01:40:01,258 --> 01:40:14,128
[SPEAKER_05]: If there is an emergency, we've built trust, so now our residents have people they can lean on, they know they can trust the city, they know where they can find help, where our shelters will be, where our food sources will be, and water.

968
01:40:15,689 --> 01:40:18,852
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a crisis, but we're working on it, and we're gonna continue to work on it.

969
01:40:20,093 --> 01:40:20,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor, two minutes.

970
01:40:21,154 --> 01:40:21,434
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

971
01:40:23,803 --> 01:40:26,565
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last 12 years, I've come a long way in the environment.

972
01:40:28,165 --> 01:40:29,526
[SPEAKER_00]: My position has changed.

973
01:40:29,546 --> 01:40:33,728
[SPEAKER_00]: I've become a lot more educated than I was when I was first elected to Council in 2011.

974
01:40:34,409 --> 01:40:40,112
[SPEAKER_00]: So I believe that we need all we can do to increase Medford' resilience against climate change.

975
01:40:40,832 --> 01:40:43,414
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to invest in a new green future.

976
01:40:44,554 --> 01:40:49,197
[SPEAKER_00]: As many of you know, we are in a floodplain district, and I want to make sure that our floodplain

977
01:40:49,617 --> 01:41:02,820
[SPEAKER_00]: It's updated annually, and as we face the rising levels of the seawater, and many of you who live along the Mystic knows how close it is, and if the weather is right, the water comes up real high.

978
01:41:03,220 --> 01:41:13,503
[SPEAKER_00]: But our businesses should take advantage of the programs established by the governments and by utilities to go green, like installing solar panels and using solar energy.

979
01:41:13,763 --> 01:41:18,164
[SPEAKER_00]: I supported our energy director for

980
01:41:19,404 --> 01:41:23,309
[SPEAKER_00]: solar panels on all new buildings and making sure that they're all environmentally safe.

981
01:41:23,670 --> 01:41:27,835
[SPEAKER_00]: But battling climate change isn't an empty business.

982
01:41:28,336 --> 01:41:32,541
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the decision to be at the start of a new energy revolution.

983
01:41:35,265 --> 01:41:35,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor, one minute.

984
01:41:37,045 --> 01:41:37,385
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

985
01:41:37,405 --> 01:41:45,068
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to point out some good work from not only the Board of Health, but our communications director, who's a jack-of-all-trades.

986
01:41:45,528 --> 01:41:57,632
[SPEAKER_05]: We applied for a $2 million grant from the federal government that's hopefully in queue to create a municipal vulnerability preparedness site, and that is the Hegner Center.

987
01:41:57,672 --> 01:42:00,673
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a building that the city owns that needs to be rehabbed.

988
01:42:01,193 --> 01:42:08,937
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're hoping to get that 2 million so that we can create a site to create a safe space in case of a climate emergency.

989
01:42:08,957 --> 01:42:16,660
[SPEAKER_05]: And that will be important, too, because we have the additional time where there isn't an emergency, we'll be able to use

990
01:42:17,140 --> 01:42:22,081
[SPEAKER_05]: that as rec space or senior space, and our rec director has been hard at work.

991
01:42:22,221 --> 01:42:28,303
[SPEAKER_05]: He's always there when we need a helping hand, and what we need now is some help with our after-school crisis.

992
01:42:29,283 --> 01:42:38,906
[SPEAKER_05]: We have hundreds on the wait list, and that site would be able to allow Medford Recreation to house and create a program, which we already have the plans for.

993
01:42:39,186 --> 01:42:43,227
[SPEAKER_05]: We just need the space to create an after-school program.

994
01:42:44,127 --> 01:42:44,927
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilor, one minute.

995
01:42:45,608 --> 01:42:45,948
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

996
01:42:46,708 --> 01:42:52,170
[SPEAKER_00]: So energy is always a topic in everyone's mind, and education is the key.

997
01:42:53,430 --> 01:42:55,371
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to educate more people in our community.

998
01:42:56,511 --> 01:43:04,774
[SPEAKER_00]: Our problem is we keep putting out these studies and things and programs, but they reach such a small amount of people.

999
01:43:05,675 --> 01:43:09,296
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time we do a study, it's the same 300 or 400 people that keep responding.

1000
01:43:09,616 --> 01:43:11,137
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to reach out into the communities.

1001
01:43:12,677 --> 01:43:16,860
[SPEAKER_00]: bring our energy program to different schools every month, let the people know what's available to them.

1002
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:23,143
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people don't even know that we have an aggregate plan to save them almost 50% of the electricity from national grid.

1003
01:43:23,944 --> 01:43:28,487
[SPEAKER_00]: And I call, I probably get two or three calls a month from people saying, I didn't know I could do that.

1004
01:43:29,187 --> 01:43:36,289
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think education is the key and we need to branch it out, not just a little to the people who are on social media.

1005
01:43:37,369 --> 01:43:43,111
[SPEAKER_00]: Many, many people in this community don't have social media and don't have access to it or don't know how to use it.

1006
01:43:45,351 --> 01:43:45,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1007
01:43:46,131 --> 01:43:48,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan, question for the council.

1008
01:43:50,209 --> 01:44:01,694
[SPEAKER_06]: With the end of federal pandemic relief money in sight, what is your plan for budgeting positions and functions that are being paid for with that money once it's no longer available?

1009
01:44:02,972 --> 01:44:09,479
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know at the schools, we have issues with the ESSA money running out and other problems.

1010
01:44:09,900 --> 01:44:15,286
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could be facing the layoff of 30 plus teachers this year, which is a grave concern.

1011
01:44:15,966 --> 01:44:21,893
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we all knew that all the money was going to come to an end at some point, and now the end is here.

1012
01:44:23,817 --> 01:44:27,860
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of our issue as councilors in doing this is city has asked for a budget.

1013
01:44:28,941 --> 01:44:33,624
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were given a budget this year that our own budget director said was wrong.

1014
01:44:34,605 --> 01:44:41,009
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've never seen an updated budget, so I don't know exactly what our financial status is in the city.

1015
01:44:42,070 --> 01:44:51,197
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to see an independent audit done now to see where we stand for funds going toward the end of the year, so we know we can plan for our schools.

1016
01:44:53,732 --> 01:45:00,598
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to point out, because I know there was a council meeting last night, and it's been talked about the last week.

1017
01:45:00,698 --> 01:45:06,483
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure who did the homework, but there was talks about how the budget was wrong.

1018
01:45:06,983 --> 01:45:15,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, the budget was done by my chief of staff, budget director, and CFO, and it was given to the council the earliest I ever recall.

1019
01:45:15,370 --> 01:45:16,631
[SPEAKER_05]: So we gave the budget in May.

1020
01:45:17,532 --> 01:45:20,655
[SPEAKER_05]: What's being talked about over the last week is that the actuals were wrong.

1021
01:45:21,596 --> 01:45:25,300
[SPEAKER_05]: The actuals were as of the May timeframe.

1022
01:45:25,560 --> 01:45:30,546
[SPEAKER_05]: We still had another month and a half to bring that up to what we actually budgeted.

1023
01:45:30,627 --> 01:45:32,188
[SPEAKER_05]: So we did budget correctly.

1024
01:45:33,170 --> 01:45:34,932
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to point that out.

1025
01:45:36,974 --> 01:45:37,715
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you repeat the question?

1026
01:45:40,186 --> 01:45:42,008
[SPEAKER_06]: With the end of federal... Got it.

1027
01:45:42,028 --> 01:45:45,411
[SPEAKER_05]: With the federal pandemic relief money.

1028
01:45:45,431 --> 01:45:45,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1029
01:45:45,511 --> 01:45:45,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1030
01:45:46,012 --> 01:45:46,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.

1031
01:45:47,453 --> 01:45:50,036
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have ESSER funding that has been spent.

1032
01:45:50,096 --> 01:45:52,018
[SPEAKER_05]: You can only use it through September of 2024.

1033
01:45:52,058 --> 01:45:52,218
[SPEAKER_05]: We have

1034
01:45:55,461 --> 01:46:00,323
[SPEAKER_05]: ARPA funding that can be spent through December 31st, 2024.

1035
01:46:01,923 --> 01:46:06,325
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are strategically budgeting in preparation for that.

1036
01:46:06,825 --> 01:46:07,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it going to be difficult?

1037
01:46:07,905 --> 01:46:08,425
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it is.

1038
01:46:08,905 --> 01:46:20,069
[SPEAKER_05]: But we have gone from a $12 million revenue loss in fiscal year 21 down to $4 million this year.

1039
01:46:20,309 --> 01:46:23,050
[SPEAKER_05]: And what we've done is we've saved $2 million

1040
01:46:23,770 --> 01:46:27,034
[SPEAKER_05]: to continue to go down for fiscal year 25.

1041
01:46:27,434 --> 01:46:29,176
[SPEAKER_05]: That doesn't mean we don't have a problem.

1042
01:46:29,256 --> 01:46:37,204
[SPEAKER_05]: We've put on positions in our schools and in our city that are funded through this revenue, but we've already started thinking about it.

1043
01:46:37,465 --> 01:46:43,171
[SPEAKER_05]: With our social worker, we're going to transition her to the opioid settlement, $830,000 that we've been able to receive over 18 years.

1044
01:46:45,773 --> 01:46:56,799
[SPEAKER_05]: With our economic development planner, we are going to be able to use some of our CDBG money because we've been able to be strategic with that funding.

1045
01:46:57,099 --> 01:47:04,003
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to do everything we can to keep positions in place, but it will be a struggle, which is why it's another pull of the budget.

1046
01:47:05,704 --> 01:47:06,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor, one minute.

1047
01:47:06,866 --> 01:47:07,186
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1048
01:47:07,767 --> 01:47:15,295
[SPEAKER_00]: So while the mayor was hiring people, other cities like Malden were buying DPW trucks and upgrading their DPW.

1049
01:47:17,077 --> 01:47:18,518
[SPEAKER_00]: Lowell bought fire trucks.

1050
01:47:20,819 --> 01:47:22,440
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't invest in anything tangible.

1051
01:47:22,820 --> 01:47:24,682
[SPEAKER_00]: We did minimal, tangible investment.

1052
01:47:25,002 --> 01:47:27,043
[SPEAKER_00]: We invested in employees and programs.

1053
01:47:27,744 --> 01:47:32,968
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, other cities use their money, I think, in a much better way than we use.

1054
01:47:33,008 --> 01:47:36,350
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would have liked to have seen us buy a fire truck like Lowell did.

1055
01:47:36,390 --> 01:47:37,291
[SPEAKER_00]: Lowell bought eight.

1056
01:47:38,411 --> 01:47:39,412
[SPEAKER_00]: Quincy bought fire trucks.

1057
01:47:39,913 --> 01:47:43,815
[SPEAKER_00]: Baldwin, again, showed up their DBW with all new equipment.

1058
01:47:45,436 --> 01:47:50,440
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't see no new equipment coming to our city from the ARPA funding like they did.

1059
01:47:53,605 --> 01:47:55,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor, if I could just clear the record.

1060
01:47:56,066 --> 01:48:03,712
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole list of what we have done with our upper funding is on the website, and I have come to the council with any expenditure over about $200,000.

1061
01:48:04,452 --> 01:48:11,637
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll just leave it with, I know I only have a minute, but fire alone, we've spent over $500,000 on engine three bay floor.

1062
01:48:11,677 --> 01:48:15,300
[SPEAKER_05]: We've spent over $500,000 to enhance communication systems between stations.

1063
01:48:21,924 --> 01:48:23,706
[SPEAKER_05]: six hybrid police cruisers.

1064
01:48:24,106 --> 01:48:27,588
[SPEAKER_05]: We've bought multiple pieces of equipment for DPW.

1065
01:48:27,969 --> 01:48:33,973
[SPEAKER_05]: We have money saved aside for fire turnout gear.

1066
01:48:35,654 --> 01:48:38,877
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole list, there are hundreds of projects that we've been able to do.

1067
01:48:38,937 --> 01:48:44,061
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been putting money towards mitigation in our Board of Health, a whole host of things.

1068
01:48:44,081 --> 01:48:45,502
[SPEAKER_05]: We've had community meetings.

1069
01:48:45,522 --> 01:48:47,223
[SPEAKER_05]: We've had presentations to the council.

1070
01:48:47,683 --> 01:48:52,988
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I'm not sure where you've been, but I just hope you take a look at the website.

1071
01:48:53,008 --> 01:48:55,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mayor.

1072
01:48:55,670 --> 01:48:57,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Penny, a question for the Mayor.

1073
01:48:57,071 --> 01:48:57,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Two minutes.

1074
01:48:59,974 --> 01:49:02,576
[SPEAKER_07]: The demographics of the city have changed over time.

1075
01:49:02,836 --> 01:49:10,242
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think the city is making a sufficient effort to engage with communities of color, immigrants, and the LGBTQ community?

1076
01:49:10,703 --> 01:49:15,987
[SPEAKER_07]: What steps will you take over the next two years to enlarge the city's outreach to these communities?

1077
01:49:18,217 --> 01:49:18,537
[SPEAKER_00]: My question?

1078
01:49:19,178 --> 01:49:19,478
[SPEAKER_00]: One minute.

1079
01:49:19,558 --> 01:49:19,818
[SPEAKER_07]: Mayor.

1080
01:49:20,639 --> 01:49:21,019
[SPEAKER_05]: My question?

1081
01:49:21,900 --> 01:49:22,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Could you repeat one more time?

1082
01:49:22,780 --> 01:49:23,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

1083
01:49:27,884 --> 01:49:30,305
[SPEAKER_07]: The demographics of the city have changed over time.

1084
01:49:30,365 --> 01:49:37,190
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think the city is making a sufficient effort to engage with communities of color, immigrants, and the LGBTQ community?

1085
01:49:37,530 --> 01:49:42,934
[SPEAKER_07]: What steps will you take over the next two years to enlarge the city's outreach to those communities?

1086
01:49:43,134 --> 01:49:43,495
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Penny.

1087
01:49:45,316 --> 01:49:51,581
[SPEAKER_05]: We have hired, it's been about a year and a half, where we've hired a fabulous DEI director.

1088
01:49:52,222 --> 01:49:56,945
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a great person in place that was working HR and diversity during the pandemic.

1089
01:49:57,166 --> 01:50:08,495
[SPEAKER_05]: And over the last almost two years, we've hired Francis Wajai to be our DEI director, who is doing amazing work from working with our pride committee to plan

1090
01:50:10,207 --> 01:50:19,395
[SPEAKER_05]: 20 plus events during the month of June to working closely with our Board of Health and Office of Prevention and Outreach on that municipal vulnerability preparedness work.

1091
01:50:19,836 --> 01:50:33,408
[SPEAKER_05]: We have trying to make everybody feel inclusive with different, I know Councilor and I were at the Hispanic Heritage Month event this past weekend, and then I've also attended the Black History Month event.

1092
01:50:34,368 --> 01:50:40,951
[SPEAKER_05]: We've had Arabic Heritage Month that had 200 people there, and I think that work is so important.

1093
01:50:40,991 --> 01:50:47,294
[SPEAKER_05]: I brought my daughter to Arabic Heritage Month, and just to tell her, you know, it wasn't because it was me.

1094
01:50:47,334 --> 01:50:50,656
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was just because it's the mayor, but people want to take pictures and want to meet you.

1095
01:50:53,637 --> 01:51:06,590
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a feeling of acceptance when leaders show up at these events and not only show up at these events, communicate these events out, help plan them, help push for them, help make everybody in our community feel welcome and valued.

1096
01:51:09,953 --> 01:51:17,636
[SPEAKER_05]: accepted, and not only that, but making sure people have what they need to live in Medford.

1097
01:51:18,596 --> 01:51:22,838
[SPEAKER_05]: Municipal work is making sure that people have what they need, have the support they need.

1098
01:51:23,238 --> 01:51:27,000
[SPEAKER_05]: It's important work, and we've done a lot, and we need to do more, of course.

1099
01:51:27,580 --> 01:51:33,042
[SPEAKER_05]: The translation piece, we've made great strides, but I think that's one place where we definitely can improve.

1100
01:51:34,212 --> 01:51:34,913
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor, two minutes.

1101
01:51:35,153 --> 01:51:35,473
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1102
01:51:35,513 --> 01:51:42,399
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Medford is well on its way to staff a City Hall that is more representative of the people it serves.

1103
01:51:42,880 --> 01:51:45,782
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe that we should continue doing that, as the Mayor said.

1104
01:51:46,043 --> 01:51:51,488
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, we have too many vacancies in City Hall and jobs that are crucial for the City of Medford.

1105
01:51:52,048 --> 01:52:03,415
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, LGBTQ individuals deserve equal protections in a workplace and a city solicitor is an essential position we need in order to protect workers legally against discrimination.

1106
01:52:03,915 --> 01:52:10,559
[SPEAKER_00]: A fully staffed method can serve all of method and discrimination is too important to ignore.

1107
01:52:11,180 --> 01:52:13,741
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gone to the same events that the mayor has gone.

1108
01:52:13,761 --> 01:52:14,582
[SPEAKER_00]: We've gone there together.

1109
01:52:14,602 --> 01:52:18,244
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I, I think, uh,

1110
01:52:21,118 --> 01:52:24,780
[SPEAKER_00]: I like where we've gone for the inclusion.

1111
01:52:25,740 --> 01:52:29,741
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we need more translators in different languages.

1112
01:52:30,682 --> 01:52:34,443
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I brought one in for the Asian people.

1113
01:52:34,463 --> 01:52:38,305
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we need to grow more in those departments.

1114
01:52:38,785 --> 01:52:41,666
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think we are a welcoming community.

1115
01:52:41,886 --> 01:52:45,508
[SPEAKER_00]: You saw the Pakistani group had it, the Indian group had it at the time.

1116
01:52:45,948 --> 01:52:47,889
[SPEAKER_00]: So people are coming here.

1117
01:52:48,831 --> 01:52:50,353
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we are a diverse community.

1118
01:52:50,794 --> 01:52:52,717
[SPEAKER_00]: And people will say that we're not wrong.

1119
01:52:52,797 --> 01:52:55,301
[SPEAKER_00]: We are diverse and we do embrace diversity.

1120
01:52:57,164 --> 01:52:57,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor, one minute.

1121
01:52:59,245 --> 01:53:07,912
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just going to touch upon the staffing, not only on a diversity lens, but also just in general, because it's been brought up many times tonight.

1122
01:53:08,633 --> 01:53:13,136
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, we've done everything we can to professionalize how we hire.

1123
01:53:14,177 --> 01:53:22,724
[SPEAKER_05]: For the first time since I took office, we have a human resource department, where the hiring goes through, and Francis Wojcicki has helped us.

1124
01:53:24,305 --> 01:53:25,725
[SPEAKER_05]: create an even better process.

1125
01:53:25,805 --> 01:53:27,006
[SPEAKER_05]: We have interview panels.

1126
01:53:27,186 --> 01:53:28,086
[SPEAKER_05]: We take notes.

1127
01:53:28,206 --> 01:53:31,847
[SPEAKER_05]: We make sure that the best candidate gets the position.

1128
01:53:32,447 --> 01:53:49,351
[SPEAKER_05]: There was also a time where Vivian Wright was working for us, and I asked her to just take a look at the last six months, nine months, what is the percentage of diversity that we've hired, and we were over 25% for the first time in what I think is Medford's history, and that's something that takes

1129
01:53:50,663 --> 01:53:56,667
[SPEAKER_05]: thought, it takes making sure that the right person gets the job, and it takes work, and we're doing it.

1130
01:53:57,007 --> 01:54:00,489
[SPEAKER_05]: And as far as staffing, I am in charge of 400 people.

1131
01:54:00,809 --> 01:54:05,252
[SPEAKER_05]: There is always going to be 12 job postings on our human resource board.

1132
01:54:05,612 --> 01:54:10,436
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we've been able to hire such a great crew, and we're continuing to do that.

1133
01:54:10,756 --> 01:54:13,237
[SPEAKER_05]: There are a couple vacancies, but we're working through them.

1134
01:54:13,317 --> 01:54:18,981
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a great economic development director we've been interviewing, and we're taking one step at a time.

1135
01:54:19,264 --> 01:54:20,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor, one minute on that.

1136
01:54:21,548 --> 01:54:21,888
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1137
01:54:22,890 --> 01:54:24,693
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, too little too late.

1138
01:54:25,474 --> 01:54:32,246
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you've been in the office over three years, and again, we're taking steps now that should have been taken in day one.

1139
01:54:33,516 --> 01:54:36,879
[SPEAKER_00]: So I applaud your hiring of Frances.

1140
01:54:36,939 --> 01:54:39,681
[SPEAKER_00]: I think she's an outstanding person for the job.

1141
01:54:39,781 --> 01:54:43,784
[SPEAKER_00]: But we went all that time without a diversity director.

1142
01:54:44,045 --> 01:54:46,987
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a slash diversity director, HR director.

1143
01:54:47,187 --> 01:54:48,068
[SPEAKER_00]: We never really had that.

1144
01:54:48,108 --> 01:54:51,611
[SPEAKER_00]: We did have one, I think, under Mayor McGlynn at some point.

1145
01:54:52,111 --> 01:54:54,916
[SPEAKER_00]: But I still think we need a long way to go.

1146
01:54:55,778 --> 01:54:58,643
[SPEAKER_00]: We have key positions, again, that aren't filled.

1147
01:54:59,124 --> 01:55:03,873
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to fill these positions in order to bring more people of diversity into our city.

1148
01:55:05,165 --> 01:55:05,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1149
01:55:05,545 --> 01:55:07,946
[SPEAKER_02]: We have time for one more question from Mark.

1150
01:55:08,407 --> 01:55:09,747
[SPEAKER_02]: And Mark, this goes to the counselor.

1151
01:55:13,329 --> 01:55:33,399
[SPEAKER_11]: So many people in the country are feeling fed up or hopeless about politics because of the polarization that is characterized by incivility and anger and alternative facts.

1152
01:55:35,261 --> 01:55:38,064
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that a problem in Medford?

1153
01:55:39,225 --> 01:55:54,598
[SPEAKER_11]: And if so, what can you do as mayor to deal with that sort of polarization to address issues affecting real people and to get things done?

1154
01:55:56,966 --> 01:56:01,669
[SPEAKER_00]: I think over the years, when I first got on the council, the council was a lot more contentious.

1155
01:56:02,509 --> 01:56:06,311
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot more fighting in-house amongst the councilors.

1156
01:56:07,051 --> 01:56:12,414
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in the last probably six or seven years, that has stopped.

1157
01:56:12,654 --> 01:56:18,057
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're much more civil as a group than we have ever been.

1158
01:56:18,277 --> 01:56:25,181
[SPEAKER_00]: We may disagree on stuff, but I like the way we do work now versus the way when I first got on the council.

1159
01:56:25,541 --> 01:56:32,683
[SPEAKER_00]: people used to tease me that they used to watch the council meetings just because they used to call it the greatest show on earth.

1160
01:56:33,303 --> 01:56:35,544
[SPEAKER_00]: And they used to anger me.

1161
01:56:36,424 --> 01:56:45,847
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm proud that we've become a lot more civil, especially with the councilors and the mayor, and I think everybody in the city.

1162
01:56:46,147 --> 01:56:47,228
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the mayor's going to tell you that

1163
01:56:49,368 --> 01:56:51,809
[SPEAKER_00]: department heads are afraid to come to the council meeting.

1164
01:56:52,469 --> 01:57:03,351
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where that comes from because asking questions is the job of the city council and I don't think anyone's ever, I've tried to never make anyone feel uncomfortable as a councilor.

1165
01:57:05,152 --> 01:57:05,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor, two minutes.

1166
01:57:07,052 --> 01:57:07,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1167
01:57:08,152 --> 01:57:14,314
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the question was about our residents and

1168
01:57:16,720 --> 01:57:22,144
[SPEAKER_05]: not only in Medford, but the Commonwealth and the country, and how people are feeling.

1169
01:57:22,444 --> 01:57:27,167
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just want to bring it back and bring a little bit of hope.

1170
01:57:28,268 --> 01:57:38,615
[SPEAKER_05]: What I see in Medford, because that's where I lead, I do, I see two sides fighting on social media to the point where sometimes you just got to put it down.

1171
01:57:40,083 --> 01:58:01,742
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you put that aside, I see a community of which I know is 90 to 95% of the people that have values where we care about others, where we are kind, where we have the same concerns like building a new high school and

1172
01:58:02,402 --> 01:58:08,846
[SPEAKER_05]: fixing, making sure we go net zero by 2050, and making sure we have transportation for our residents.

1173
01:58:09,587 --> 01:58:14,350
[SPEAKER_05]: And I see people stepping up every day, whether that's serving on a board or commission.

1174
01:58:14,370 --> 01:58:20,214
[SPEAKER_05]: I see people putting food in the food pantry, and now we have nine of them.

1175
01:58:20,714 --> 01:58:24,057
[SPEAKER_05]: I see our Department of Public Works who built those food pantries.

1176
01:58:24,737 --> 01:58:32,041
[SPEAKER_05]: I see us coming together as a community, being more accepting and welcoming and inclusive than we have ever been.

1177
01:58:32,061 --> 01:58:49,710
[SPEAKER_05]: So yes, there's turmoil in the world, there's turmoil in Medford, but I like to, and I get it in my office, you know, my poor secretary gets abused, and especially during election time, it's just extra.

1178
01:58:50,870 --> 01:59:11,650
[SPEAKER_05]: So we did we do we deal with those we do deal with the bad But I try to leave the office and I try to drive home give her give her it's gonna be okay But and think about the good think about the people that we do have in place the residents that are doing Helping us move this city forward every day Thank you, so I'm one I

1179
01:59:15,856 --> 01:59:17,417
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm one who steps up to do the job.

1180
01:59:17,837 --> 01:59:19,178
[SPEAKER_00]: I answer the call when people call me.

1181
01:59:19,678 --> 01:59:23,481
[SPEAKER_00]: I continue to work at the food bank on a weekly basis since COVID.

1182
01:59:24,041 --> 01:59:26,223
[SPEAKER_00]: I made the phone calls to the people in their homes.

1183
01:59:26,243 --> 01:59:27,503
[SPEAKER_00]: So I step up.

1184
01:59:27,964 --> 01:59:28,604
[SPEAKER_00]: I do the work.

1185
01:59:28,744 --> 01:59:33,487
[SPEAKER_00]: I volunteer in this community for the youth, for the seniors, and for everybody.

1186
01:59:33,927 --> 01:59:39,891
[SPEAKER_00]: No one can say that Rick Caraviello hasn't stepped up in this community whenever asked and whenever needed, ever.

1187
01:59:39,911 --> 01:59:42,493
[SPEAKER_05]: One minute.

1188
01:59:46,701 --> 01:59:50,862
[SPEAKER_05]: I too think Councilor Caraviello has stepped up, and I thank him for that.

1189
01:59:51,042 --> 01:59:56,304
[SPEAKER_05]: You were out delivering groceries with my husband when people were afraid to leave their homes.

1190
01:59:56,444 --> 02:00:00,725
[SPEAKER_05]: So I give you tremendous credit, and I thank you for that.

1191
02:00:01,085 --> 02:00:03,346
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't insinuating otherwise.

1192
02:00:03,366 --> 02:00:07,487
[SPEAKER_05]: I too do what is best for the community.

1193
02:00:07,547 --> 02:00:08,827
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I lead a city.

1194
02:00:08,847 --> 02:00:11,488
[SPEAKER_05]: I am really digging into school issues.

1195
02:00:12,648 --> 02:00:21,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Three children, they don't even do Girls on the Run, but I coach 27 little cuties every week because I want to make an impact.

1196
02:00:22,053 --> 02:00:24,915
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that's one thing we have in common, Councilor.

1197
02:00:25,355 --> 02:00:30,538
[SPEAKER_05]: You're always stepping up, and I always try to be the best person I can, no matter how tired I am.

1198
02:00:30,558 --> 02:00:40,864
[SPEAKER_05]: My poor family is the one that probably suffers the most if I'm, you know, exhausted on the couch by Friday night, but that is something we do have in common, and I'm proud of that.

1199
02:00:44,109 --> 02:00:44,710
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1200
02:00:45,231 --> 02:00:46,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Great question to end on

1201
02:00:54,673 --> 02:00:54,993
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1202
02:00:56,073 --> 02:01:04,136
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I want to thank the chamber, again, for which I was proud to be a director, president, and executive director of.

1203
02:01:04,576 --> 02:01:08,337
[SPEAKER_00]: So my unwavering commitment to the city of Medford shows in my civic engagement.

1204
02:01:08,717 --> 02:01:11,898
[SPEAKER_00]: I have served in leadership as council president for three different terms.

1205
02:01:12,498 --> 02:01:15,321
[SPEAKER_00]: I am an active member of the Meffitt Kiwanis, which I have served as president.

1206
02:01:15,721 --> 02:01:18,163
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a past president of Meffitt Utaki.

1207
02:01:18,604 --> 02:01:22,367
[SPEAKER_00]: I serve on the gaming commission for the mitigation.

1208
02:01:22,827 --> 02:01:30,655
[SPEAKER_00]: I continue to this day to volunteer at the Meffitt Food Pantry on a weekly basis, and I co-chair the Meffitt Public Library Foundation.

1209
02:01:30,695 --> 02:01:33,857
[SPEAKER_00]: So many people ask me, why am I running for mayor?

1210
02:01:33,978 --> 02:01:34,818
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer is simple.

1211
02:01:35,199 --> 02:01:36,059
[SPEAKER_00]: We need new leadership.

1212
02:01:36,420 --> 02:01:37,401
[SPEAKER_00]: We need someone who will act.

1213
02:01:38,308 --> 02:01:46,193
[SPEAKER_00]: Our firefighters have gone 826 days without a contract, and several other unions recently settled contracts after years of neglected negotiation.

1214
02:01:46,233 --> 02:01:47,854
[SPEAKER_00]: When elected, I will act.

1215
02:01:48,775 --> 02:01:54,878
[SPEAKER_00]: Critical offices in City Hall remain vacant, costing taxpayers millions of dollars per year in outsourced work.

1216
02:01:55,599 --> 02:01:58,320
[SPEAKER_00]: The current administration has sat back and has allowed this to happen.

1217
02:01:58,901 --> 02:02:00,142
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's time to act.

1218
02:02:01,622 --> 02:02:05,345
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't believe Meffitt has properly utilized our Chapter 90 funds, and it shows.

1219
02:02:06,283 --> 02:02:10,146
[SPEAKER_00]: Our new growth is limited with developers talking instead of building.

1220
02:02:10,587 --> 02:02:16,391
[SPEAKER_00]: And others are being stopped in court to stop affordable housing, which we are not even at our 10% yet.

1221
02:02:17,192 --> 02:02:21,316
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to act to move Medford in the direction of progress, not just stabilization.

1222
02:02:22,096 --> 02:02:26,100
[SPEAKER_00]: As a councilor, I've seen how little is communicated from the administration to us.

1223
02:02:26,380 --> 02:02:30,463
[SPEAKER_00]: As your mayor, I will bring a new level of transparency to Medford.

1224
02:02:30,743 --> 02:02:32,565
[SPEAKER_00]: I will partner with the Medford City Council

1225
02:02:33,240 --> 02:02:37,344
[SPEAKER_00]: the community, and those seeking to do business in our city, in order to bring the change that we need.

1226
02:02:38,645 --> 02:02:44,049
[SPEAKER_00]: I am running to answer the call for new leadership that I hear in every corner of Medford, so I ask you to join me.

1227
02:02:44,770 --> 02:02:46,932
[SPEAKER_00]: I am running, we can do better.

1228
02:02:48,053 --> 02:02:49,474
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be better, you must be better.

1229
02:02:49,955 --> 02:02:51,236
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe I am the better candidate.

1230
02:02:51,716 --> 02:02:54,338
[SPEAKER_00]: I respectfully ask you for your vote on Tuesday, November 7th.

1231
02:02:54,979 --> 02:02:56,200
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's change and act together.

1232
02:02:56,320 --> 02:02:56,961
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.

1233
02:03:04,039 --> 02:03:05,200
[SPEAKER_02]: Mayor, you have two minutes.

1234
02:03:06,040 --> 02:03:12,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Jim, moderators, the chamber, and Kevin at Medford Community Media, and the audience for tuning in.

1235
02:03:12,684 --> 02:03:22,750
[SPEAKER_05]: When I came into office, the city was not only facing incredible challenges like a global pandemic, but we were contending with lack of plans and long overdue investments to our infrastructure.

1236
02:03:23,650 --> 02:03:28,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Since 2020, I have focused on leading in a way that was fair to all and accountable to Medford residents.

1237
02:03:29,737 --> 02:03:40,829
[SPEAKER_05]: While navigating us through the pandemic, my team and I also focused on doing the planning and the work needed to secure state and federal funding to address our infrastructure needs and address decades of neglect.

1238
02:03:41,950 --> 02:03:46,651
[SPEAKER_05]: And most importantly, I focused on delivering for Medford by hiring highly qualified professionals.

1239
02:03:47,491 --> 02:03:49,112
[SPEAKER_05]: We focus on smart budgeting.

1240
02:03:49,552 --> 02:03:56,214
[SPEAKER_05]: We are professionalizing city services and embed accountability and transparency in all we do.

1241
02:03:57,054 --> 02:04:07,476
[SPEAKER_05]: It's because of my record of getting things done that I've been endorsed by Governor Healey, Lieutenant Governor Driscoll, Congresswoman Clark, Representative Barber, organized labor, school committee members, Ms.

1242
02:04:07,517 --> 02:04:09,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Stone, McLaughlin, and Hayes.

1243
02:04:10,751 --> 02:04:11,371
[SPEAKER_05]: to name a few.

1244
02:04:12,231 --> 02:04:27,854
[SPEAKER_05]: With all that we have accomplished in just two terms, we all know there is still so much work to do and so many challenges ahead of us, from the impacts of climate change and increasing mobility through our streets and public transportation to addressing our housing crisis and improving our public schools.

1245
02:04:28,935 --> 02:04:36,516
[SPEAKER_05]: We need experienced leadership, trusted leadership that can continue this work and continue moving Medford forward.

1246
02:04:37,372 --> 02:04:46,985
[SPEAKER_05]: In the past, there was a culture within the city where connections were valued over community, which led to an unfair system and missed opportunities for the growth we need.

1247
02:04:47,806 --> 02:04:49,409
[SPEAKER_05]: We cannot go backwards.

1248
02:04:50,049 --> 02:04:50,790
[SPEAKER_05]: We just can't.

1249
02:04:51,952 --> 02:04:53,634
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember, you have two important decisions.

1250
02:04:54,397 --> 02:05:05,942
[SPEAKER_05]: You have ahead of you the decision to get out and vote and the decision to vote for which candidates you think will make a positive difference in the lives of all Medford residents.

1251
02:05:06,522 --> 02:05:13,845
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be an honor to earn your vote on November 7th so I can continue leading this city and our strong team in the right direction.

1252
02:05:14,165 --> 02:05:14,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1253
02:05:14,485 --> 02:05:20,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mayor.

1254
02:05:21,448 --> 02:05:21,788
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's it.

1255
02:05:22,915 --> 02:05:23,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

1256
02:05:24,576 --> 02:05:25,976
[SPEAKER_02]: That does conclude this debate.

1257
02:05:26,156 --> 02:05:31,958
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just want to say thank you all for making my virgin stint as a moderator painless.

1258
02:05:32,018 --> 02:05:32,518
[SPEAKER_02]: It was great.

1259
02:05:33,218 --> 02:05:41,221
[SPEAKER_02]: And how great it was to have a civil issues-based debate here.

1260
02:05:41,461 --> 02:05:43,502
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we don't see this very often lately.

1261
02:05:44,042 --> 02:05:50,304
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I would say that even though just one of these people can win, everybody here won, because you got to hear the issues.

1262
02:05:50,324 --> 02:05:52,505
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you both very much.

1263
02:05:55,834 --> 02:05:58,580
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you to our panel as well, and to the chamber.

1264
02:05:59,201 --> 02:05:59,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you all.

1265
02:06:00,323 --> 02:06:00,644
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1266
02:06:00,844 --> 02:06:01,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good night.

1267
02:06:06,175 --> 02:06:06,997
[SPEAKER_03]: So nice to meet you.
