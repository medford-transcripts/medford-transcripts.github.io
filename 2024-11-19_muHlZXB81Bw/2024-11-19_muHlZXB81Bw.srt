1
00:00:06,215 --> 00:00:08,976
[SPEAKER_02]: I see that he's on zoom vice president bears.

2
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:14,578
[SPEAKER_12]: He's waving hello.

3
00:00:15,859 --> 00:00:17,720
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Collins? Here.

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:19,460
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Knight.

5
00:00:20,121 --> 00:00:20,821
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Scarpelli.

6
00:00:21,301 --> 00:00:26,743
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Tseng, President Morell, President, and Councilor Carvaviello.

7
00:00:27,024 --> 00:00:28,884
[SPEAKER_07]: So the affirmative please rise to the flag.

8
00:00:35,757 --> 00:00:39,620
[SPEAKER_07]: One nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

9
00:00:40,981 --> 00:00:42,262
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

10
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:45,485
[SPEAKER_07]: Motions, orders, and resolutions.

11
00:00:45,505 --> 00:00:49,187
[SPEAKER_07]: 22050 offered by Council of Knights.

12
00:00:49,728 --> 00:00:58,474
[SPEAKER_07]: We are so resolved that the Medford City Council extend its appreciation, gratitude, and well wishes to the Salvato family, owners and proprietors of Espresso Pizza,

13
00:00:59,675 --> 00:01:14,722
[SPEAKER_07]: for efforts in support of the community spanning over four decades in the city of Medford and be it further resolved that the Salvato family be recognized by the city of Medford by way of dedicating the corner of Winthrop and Boston Avenue in recognition of the Salvato family.

14
00:01:15,562 --> 00:01:17,000
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight?

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,728
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, thank you very much and I know that you and I was supposed to be co sponsors on this I apologize for leaving you off.

15
00:01:22,988 --> 00:01:26,290
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that you and I spoke about.

16
00:01:26,751 --> 00:01:30,834
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's the Sobato family are owners and operators of Expressos pizzeria on Boston Ave.

17
00:01:30,854 --> 00:01:33,736
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, but just that just closed very recently.

18
00:01:34,336 --> 00:01:40,501
[SPEAKER_09]: And for 40 years they operated at that corner and they were one of the first businesses in this community to get an extended hours license.

19
00:01:41,661 --> 00:01:42,942
[SPEAKER_09]: And they really set a trend up there.

20
00:01:42,962 --> 00:01:49,827
[SPEAKER_09]: They serviced my neighborhood that I grew up in, as well as I'm sure Councilor Collins will tell us, Tufts University population for a great deal.

21
00:01:49,868 --> 00:01:52,229
[SPEAKER_09]: But they've always been a great neighbor and a great partner in the community.

22
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:55,332
[SPEAKER_09]: And after 40 years, they're hanging up the aprons and the pizza wheel.

23
00:01:55,892 --> 00:02:01,716
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think it goes without saying that they deserve some recognition for the community building that they did here in this city.

24
00:02:01,756 --> 00:02:04,098
[SPEAKER_09]: And they've offered this community, Mr. President.

25
00:02:04,118 --> 00:02:05,459
[SPEAKER_09]: They're great people, a great family.

26
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:09,442
[SPEAKER_09]: I had the opportunity to grow up with some nephews, some of our nephews in the Davises as well.

27
00:02:10,042 --> 00:02:12,923
[SPEAKER_09]: great kids, great people, all giving to this community now.

28
00:02:13,363 --> 00:02:17,503
[SPEAKER_09]: So with that being said, I'd ask my council colleagues to support this resolution and send it to the administration for the request.

29
00:02:18,244 --> 00:02:18,584
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

30
00:02:18,624 --> 00:02:22,924
[SPEAKER_07]: And personally myself, I want to thank Councilor for putting me on with this.

31
00:02:23,024 --> 00:02:32,806
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think there's anybody that lives, either went to Tufts or lives in probably most areas of West Medford that haven't had an expresso pizza.

32
00:02:32,826 --> 00:02:37,467
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, Friday, Saturday nights, they used to turn their phone off.

33
00:02:38,707 --> 00:02:41,350
[SPEAKER_07]: The calls are coming in so fast and furious.

34
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:45,614
[SPEAKER_07]: I think at one point they had like 17, 18 drivers on the weekend.

35
00:02:45,634 --> 00:02:52,822
[SPEAKER_07]: So, good family, been there for many years and I just want to thank them for all the things they've done for our community.

36
00:02:53,023 --> 00:02:53,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President.

37
00:02:54,104 --> 00:02:54,825
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli.

38
00:02:54,865 --> 00:02:55,425
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you again.

39
00:02:55,545 --> 00:02:56,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for bringing this forward, Councilor.

40
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:05,728
[SPEAKER_05]: Council President, this is, this is a family that again you have to celebrate because although they owned a successful business.

41
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:13,418
[SPEAKER_05]: They were always one of the first businesses get back to the youth of the community so often you go in there, and you'd see a new plaque.

42
00:03:15,219 --> 00:03:19,641
[SPEAKER_05]: express those representing and sponsoring another youth team or activity.

43
00:03:19,721 --> 00:03:33,525
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've had the pleasure to know a lot of this Salvato family, and I know that they've done so much for our community, and I would support and second Councilor Knight's motion.

44
00:03:33,865 --> 00:03:34,565
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

45
00:03:34,806 --> 00:03:35,766
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, any further discussion?

46
00:03:36,426 --> 00:03:42,368
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the motion by Councilor Knight and Councilor Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

47
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:47,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President bears.

48
00:03:48,321 --> 00:03:48,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

49
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:52,544
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Collins.

50
00:03:53,165 --> 00:03:53,405
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

51
00:03:54,146 --> 00:03:54,626
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Knight.

52
00:04:00,694 --> 00:04:01,314
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Scarpelli.

53
00:04:01,495 --> 00:04:02,455
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, 7 in the affirmative.

54
00:04:02,915 --> 00:04:24,189
[SPEAKER_07]: Zero in the negative, motion passes. 22-051, offered by Councilor Knight be a result that the city, the Medford City Council require recordings of all city boards and commissions who are conducting proceedings virtually on the city website for no less than 36 months and be a further resolve that the city solicitor provide a draft ordinance requiring such

55
00:04:25,695 --> 00:04:27,577
[SPEAKER_07]: in search for council deliberation.

56
00:04:27,997 --> 00:04:28,598
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

57
00:04:28,778 --> 00:04:30,099
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

58
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:40,929
[SPEAKER_09]: I've gotten a number of complaints recently from members of the community seeking copies of minutes or copies of meetings related to especially the Cannabis Advisory Commission as well as the Historic Commission.

59
00:04:41,589 --> 00:04:44,312
[SPEAKER_09]: And these documents or records are not available readily on the website.

60
00:04:44,972 --> 00:04:58,443
[SPEAKER_09]: So after multiple calls, I thought it might make sense for us to reach out to the administration and ask them to take the appropriate steps to ensure that this material gets posted publicly and transparently, and that the council take the appropriate steps to ensure that this is a standard and a norm, not an anomaly.

61
00:04:59,324 --> 00:04:59,664
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

62
00:04:59,945 --> 00:05:00,325
[SPEAKER_07]: Second.

63
00:05:01,326 --> 00:05:02,227
[SPEAKER_07]: Any further discussion?

64
00:05:02,247 --> 00:05:03,368
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clark, anybody want to speak?

65
00:05:04,589 --> 00:05:05,509
[SPEAKER_03]: No hands raised.

66
00:05:10,396 --> 00:05:16,781
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, both in terms of transparency and in terms of community participation, I think this measure is important.

67
00:05:17,222 --> 00:05:25,309
[SPEAKER_04]: I also think it's helpful for our community when we have more people participating so they can give us their ideas and help us reach more innovative solutions.

68
00:05:25,369 --> 00:05:26,590
[SPEAKER_04]: So I definitely support this.

69
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:27,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

70
00:05:27,731 --> 00:05:33,375
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so on the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

71
00:05:34,256 --> 00:05:35,717
[SPEAKER_07]: No further discussion, Mr. Clerk.

72
00:05:35,817 --> 00:05:36,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President.

73
00:05:38,787 --> 00:05:41,748
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, I don't have a camera.

74
00:05:41,768 --> 00:05:43,508
[SPEAKER_07]: So just speak up if I don't see you.

75
00:05:44,049 --> 00:05:44,549
[SPEAKER_08]: You're all right.

76
00:05:45,469 --> 00:05:54,671
[SPEAKER_08]: I would just if, if Councilor Knight would be so amenable to amend this to include that minutes be posted, even if the meetings are occurring in person.

77
00:05:57,152 --> 00:05:58,993
[SPEAKER_09]: We certainly have no problem with that, sir.

78
00:05:59,353 --> 00:05:59,753
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

79
00:06:01,233 --> 00:06:07,455
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli as amended by vice president bears.

80
00:06:09,053 --> 00:06:10,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

81
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:17,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Bears.

82
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:18,596
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

83
00:06:20,557 --> 00:06:21,217
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Collins.

84
00:06:21,478 --> 00:06:21,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

85
00:06:22,798 --> 00:06:23,298
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Knight.

86
00:06:23,578 --> 00:06:23,798
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

87
00:06:24,038 --> 00:06:24,779
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Scarpelli.

88
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:25,099
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

89
00:06:25,339 --> 00:06:25,859
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Tseng.

90
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:26,199
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

91
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:27,320
[SPEAKER_12]: President Morell.

92
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:27,960
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

93
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,881
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Kerrio-Long.

94
00:06:30,361 --> 00:06:30,581
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

95
00:06:32,081 --> 00:06:35,983
[SPEAKER_07]: Semi-affirmative, none the negative, motion passes.

96
00:06:38,243 --> 00:06:51,539
[SPEAKER_07]: 22052 offered by Councilor Knight be it so resolved that the Medford City Council in the executive session for the purpose of discussing the administration's data and IT vulnerabilities as identified in the 111.22 Medford transcript article.

97
00:06:54,758 --> 00:06:57,019
[SPEAKER_09]: Council night, Mister President, thank you very much.

98
00:06:57,299 --> 00:07:04,081
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, yet again, a nice personnel issue has made its way to the newspaper that's identified a number of issues that are going on here at City Hall.

99
00:07:04,862 --> 00:07:07,363
[SPEAKER_09]: One of those issues, I believe, would be an IP vulnerability.

100
00:07:07,883 --> 00:07:19,527
[SPEAKER_09]: It's my understanding that our IT director, after 24 years of employment in the city of Medford with an exemplary record, was removed from his position based upon some certain IT vulnerabilities that the council has not been made aware of.

101
00:07:20,287 --> 00:07:24,811
[SPEAKER_09]: This is very concerning to me, Mr. President, because of their IT vulnerabilities.

102
00:07:25,272 --> 00:07:33,258
[SPEAKER_09]: Similar to what we saw in the past, the administration wouldn't disclose to us when the number of personal information was taken from the city website maybe nine or 10 months ago.

103
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:41,725
[SPEAKER_09]: It just raises cause for concern, number one, and it also raises cause for liability for the city.

104
00:07:41,805 --> 00:07:48,431
[SPEAKER_09]: And if there's going to be a liability that's placed upon the city, it's going to end up costing the city money, and the council should know about it, because we're the steward of the taxpayer dollar.

105
00:07:49,193 --> 00:08:02,401
[SPEAKER_09]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I'd ask that this motion to move forward that we set up an executive session with the city administration for us to discuss these it vulnerabilities to see what steps we need to take to ensure that the personal information and data of the taxpayers in this community is protected appropriately.

106
00:08:02,942 --> 00:08:03,402
[SPEAKER_07]: Second.

107
00:08:03,662 --> 00:08:04,022
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

108
00:08:04,823 --> 00:08:06,224
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, any further discussion.

109
00:08:10,695 --> 00:08:11,376
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

110
00:08:11,396 --> 00:08:13,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I support this resolution.

111
00:08:13,957 --> 00:08:26,626
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can just work just to make sure that this notice is narrowly worded because if we do, if we were to, we don't want to, if we were to venture into the personnel, then we would have to make sure that we're inviting the proper people.

112
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:36,153
[SPEAKER_06]: So making sure it's worded in a way that we're getting the update on the IT vulnerabilities and not in a personnel sense is my opinion and just the need to make sure it's properly noticed.

113
00:08:37,954 --> 00:08:38,275
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

114
00:08:39,075 --> 00:08:39,856
[SPEAKER_07]: Any further discussion?

115
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:44,910
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the motion by Councilor Knight seconded by Councilor Scott belly.

116
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:47,190
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clerk, please call the role.

117
00:08:47,671 --> 00:08:48,471
[SPEAKER_12]: Vice President bears.

118
00:08:50,151 --> 00:08:50,411
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

119
00:08:52,112 --> 00:08:52,772
[SPEAKER_12]: Council Collins.

120
00:08:53,012 --> 00:08:53,232
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

121
00:08:53,672 --> 00:08:54,192
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Knight.

122
00:08:54,572 --> 00:08:54,952
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

123
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:55,713
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor scruffy.

124
00:08:55,733 --> 00:08:55,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

125
00:08:56,293 --> 00:08:57,153
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Tseng yes.

126
00:08:57,853 --> 00:08:58,493
[SPEAKER_02]: President Morell.

127
00:09:03,214 --> 00:09:03,714
[SPEAKER_02]: President.

128
00:09:04,635 --> 00:09:04,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

129
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:08,056
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

130
00:09:08,476 --> 00:09:09,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Kerrio.

131
00:09:09,436 --> 00:09:10,477
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, 70 affirmative.

132
00:09:10,977 --> 00:09:12,617
[SPEAKER_07]: Another negative motion passes.

133
00:09:12,858 --> 00:09:15,578
[SPEAKER_07]: 22053 offered by Councilor Knight.

134
00:09:16,499 --> 00:09:22,320
[SPEAKER_07]: We have so resolved that the Municipal City Council will establish a subcommittee on litigation.

135
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,021
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

136
00:09:23,501 --> 00:09:24,741
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

137
00:09:25,001 --> 00:09:28,322
[SPEAKER_09]: Litigation and representation has been the topic of discussion.

138
00:09:28,962 --> 00:09:34,424
[SPEAKER_09]: Most of those terms so far, Mr. President, for the last four or five weeks, that's all we've been talking about is litigation and representation.

139
00:09:35,425 --> 00:09:49,382
[SPEAKER_09]: And recently, this council passed a money bill to amend the fiscal year budget to allow the mayor's private legal counsel to really have an open checkbook for litigation.

140
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:53,648
[SPEAKER_09]: And when we look at what's going on here in the community and you think about the litigation that's pending,

141
00:09:54,426 --> 00:10:04,931
[SPEAKER_09]: and the amount of money that's been appropriated, and whether or not that amount of money is going to be able to stretch to cover the issues that are in dispute right now, it raises some concern for me financially.

142
00:10:04,951 --> 00:10:15,836
[SPEAKER_09]: So when you think about the more than 25 labor charges that are against the city right now, when you think about the 340 developments that the city's fighting right now, that doesn't look like we're fighting a winning battle.

143
00:10:16,936 --> 00:10:18,417
[SPEAKER_09]: When you look at the potential

144
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:25,275
[SPEAKER_09]: issue with the cannabis advisory commission in the conflict of interest concerning one of the members of the selection committee.

145
00:10:26,135 --> 00:10:35,560
[SPEAKER_09]: It just puts me in a position as the president to sit here and think about what we're doing with our money and whether or not we should be planning appropriately for future spending.

146
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:46,985
[SPEAKER_09]: You know since this term started I think we've spent a lot of dough in 4 or 5 weeks and I'm hoping that you know we can kind of responsibly manage

147
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:51,349
[SPEAKER_09]: our budgets, our plans, our finances.

148
00:10:51,829 --> 00:11:08,655
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that by establishing a subcommittee on litigation, that will give the council a better idea going forward as to what steps we need to take to fund the law department in an appropriate fashion to ensure that we secure our legal representation moving forward, to be sure that we secure our zoning consultant moving forward.

149
00:11:08,675 --> 00:11:12,236
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that this will help us address a number of the concerns and issues that we've raised, Mr. President.

150
00:11:12,276 --> 00:11:13,897
[SPEAKER_09]: May I ask for my council colleagues' support?

151
00:11:14,597 --> 00:11:14,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

152
00:11:16,798 --> 00:11:17,918
[SPEAKER_07]: Any discussion on this matter?

153
00:11:19,158 --> 00:11:21,039
[SPEAKER_07]: Second.

154
00:11:21,319 --> 00:11:27,061
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clark any customer or what comes up is, I think, see any hands raised.

155
00:11:27,321 --> 00:11:27,822
[SPEAKER_07]: It's me.

156
00:11:27,942 --> 00:11:30,222
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Council.

157
00:11:31,783 --> 00:11:33,024
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

158
00:11:33,604 --> 00:11:35,245
[SPEAKER_08]: Definitely support the intent of this.

159
00:11:35,805 --> 00:11:43,808
[SPEAKER_08]: If the counselor would be so amenable to refer this to the committee on rules and ordinances I think we could have the discussion in there by the end of February and get this set up.

160
00:11:47,612 --> 00:11:58,916
[SPEAKER_09]: If I'm with me, I know that the president's strong pencil also has the power to strike and create the subcommittees as we discussed at the beginning of the session, but I personally have no objections.

161
00:11:59,156 --> 00:12:03,558
[SPEAKER_09]: What direction this council chooses to go with that direction, I want to go for transparency purposes.

162
00:12:03,578 --> 00:12:05,538
[SPEAKER_09]: So be it, I have no problem with that whatsoever.

163
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:10,060
[SPEAKER_08]: Then I would move to refer to that committee on ordinances and rules.

164
00:12:11,801 --> 00:12:15,722
[SPEAKER_07]: So Councilor Bears has moved to move this to where, I'm sorry, Vice President Baez.

165
00:12:16,483 --> 00:12:18,663
[SPEAKER_08]: the subcommittee on ordinances and rules.

166
00:12:20,324 --> 00:12:22,464
[SPEAKER_07]: Move to ordinances.

167
00:12:22,484 --> 00:12:25,225
[SPEAKER_07]: Subcommittee on ordinances.

168
00:12:26,965 --> 00:12:43,488
[SPEAKER_07]: So, the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, and as amended by Councilor Bears to move this to the subcommittee on ordinances.

169
00:12:43,528 --> 00:12:45,629
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

170
00:12:47,449 --> 00:12:48,269
[SPEAKER_12]: Vice President Bears.

171
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:49,210
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

172
00:12:51,091 --> 00:12:51,811
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Collins.

173
00:12:52,151 --> 00:12:52,371
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

174
00:12:53,612 --> 00:12:54,132
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Knight.

175
00:12:56,113 --> 00:12:56,353
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

176
00:12:57,093 --> 00:12:57,834
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Scarpelli.

177
00:12:58,054 --> 00:12:58,334
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

178
00:12:58,694 --> 00:12:59,254
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Tseng.

179
00:12:59,354 --> 00:12:59,554
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

180
00:12:59,894 --> 00:13:00,555
[SPEAKER_12]: President Morell.

181
00:13:00,955 --> 00:13:01,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

182
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:03,296
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Kerrio.

183
00:13:03,336 --> 00:13:04,356
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, affirmative.

184
00:13:05,177 --> 00:13:05,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

185
00:13:06,157 --> 00:13:09,239
[SPEAKER_07]: At this time, I yield the chair to Councilor Layton.

186
00:13:13,801 --> 00:13:14,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Kerrio.

187
00:13:14,601 --> 00:13:16,622
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give you a moment to get back to your chair.

188
00:13:28,971 --> 00:13:32,612
[SPEAKER_09]: Paper 22054 offered by Councilor Caraviello.

189
00:13:32,793 --> 00:13:40,576
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it resolved the Medford City Council will have the mayor start looking into purchasing vehicles for the Medford Police Department, most patrol cars are now four plus years old with high mileage.

190
00:13:40,656 --> 00:13:41,356
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Caraviello.

191
00:13:42,677 --> 00:13:43,397
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

192
00:13:44,677 --> 00:13:50,039
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, this is something that's been discussed over many, many, many times in the city.

193
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:57,603
[SPEAKER_07]: I think four years ago, we purchased a whole bunch of new cars, and all those cars now have over 100,000 miles on it.

194
00:13:58,942 --> 00:14:05,124
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember at the time we talked about setting up a plan where we be purchasing cars every year.

195
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:10,206
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're not in a point like this where we have to go out and buy seven or eight cars.

196
00:14:12,047 --> 00:14:15,228
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, that plan never materialized.

197
00:14:15,268 --> 00:14:24,212
[SPEAKER_07]: So at this point, I'm asking us, I'm asking the administration to set up a plan to buy police cars every year.

198
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:30,603
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you don't have to buy 10 a year, but if you move two or three every year, we're not in the dream world now.

199
00:14:30,683 --> 00:14:35,466
[SPEAKER_07]: So we don't have all these cars sitting there with hundreds of thousands of miles, even though we have an in-house mechanic.

200
00:14:36,087 --> 00:14:40,928
[SPEAKER_07]: We're just spending money repairing cars, because these are cars that run 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

201
00:14:41,369 --> 00:14:47,871
[SPEAKER_07]: So I asked the administration to look into this purchase, especially where cars are in high demand right now.

202
00:14:48,651 --> 00:14:53,472
[SPEAKER_07]: It may take you longer than normal to even maybe even find a car, if there are any police cars available.

203
00:14:53,912 --> 00:14:59,154
[SPEAKER_07]: So I asked the mayor to look into this, and for the administration to come up with a plan

204
00:15:00,135 --> 00:15:07,247
[SPEAKER_07]: We're constantly purchasing cars every year, one or two at a time, so we don't have to do this backlog of waiting to do this.

205
00:15:14,476 --> 00:15:16,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for introducing this.

206
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:33,829
[SPEAKER_04]: I know there are constituents out there who may be skeptical, right, of given national trends or national discussions, but I think we should look at the history here in our city, and we should look at the fact that our cars are over 100,000, you know, the mileage is over 100,000.

207
00:15:33,869 --> 00:15:34,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are the new ones.

208
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:36,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

209
00:15:36,731 --> 00:15:43,756
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, and 100,000 for clarity is usually the median of where cars start to be, patrol vehicles start to be replaced.

210
00:15:44,736 --> 00:16:01,766
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, in order, you know, I think this is a reasonable request, although if the council would be so amenable, if, if you'd be able to amend this to say that we come up with a that the city administration come up with the capital, a complete capital plan.

211
00:16:03,627 --> 00:16:08,230
[SPEAKER_07]: So, so that it's, I don't have a problem with us coming up with a complete capital plan.

212
00:16:08,831 --> 00:16:09,891
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll take some time.

213
00:16:10,152 --> 00:16:11,272
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, yeah.

214
00:16:11,352 --> 00:16:13,614
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, but I'd like to come up with a plan just for this.

215
00:16:13,634 --> 00:16:17,216
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I said, I don't have a problem with this being part of a capital plan.

216
00:16:17,517 --> 00:16:17,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

217
00:16:18,137 --> 00:16:23,561
[SPEAKER_04]: And as a second amendment of mine would be to make sure that we are

218
00:16:24,501 --> 00:16:27,803
[SPEAKER_04]: exploring patrol vehicle policies.

219
00:16:27,943 --> 00:16:31,024
[SPEAKER_04]: This is something I've done a little bit of research on just looking into this.

220
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:45,631
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems that in municipalities across the country, the cities have negotiated deals with police unions, with the police officers where, you know, the police have a little bit more agency and a little bit more initiative.

221
00:16:46,752 --> 00:16:48,733
[SPEAKER_04]: And this research has shown that

222
00:16:49,963 --> 00:16:56,948
[SPEAKER_04]: the longevity of patrol vehicles is longer and that cities save up on costs a little bit more.

223
00:16:57,008 --> 00:17:05,635
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm talking about cities, Miami is a very big example of one, but these policies are pretty common in the Midwest and the South.

224
00:17:05,975 --> 00:17:09,998
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would just ask that the city administration explore some of these policies.

225
00:17:10,018 --> 00:17:13,661
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have to adopt anything, but I think it'd be worth our time to explore.

226
00:17:13,681 --> 00:17:15,122
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, no problem.

227
00:17:19,008 --> 00:17:19,850
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, if I could.

228
00:17:30,751 --> 00:17:31,492
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

229
00:17:32,573 --> 00:17:34,334
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello for bringing this forward.

230
00:17:34,494 --> 00:17:46,104
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm curious, I would like to amend if you'd be amenable, just to also include any updates, get an update from the administration on seeking hybrid or EV vehicles to meet these needs.

231
00:17:46,344 --> 00:17:47,605
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I brought up both budgets.

232
00:17:47,705 --> 00:17:49,227
[SPEAKER_06]: The chief has said it's something he's looking into.

233
00:17:49,247 --> 00:17:51,609
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just curious any progress we've had on that.

234
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:54,351
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not a problem.

235
00:18:02,193 --> 00:18:05,757
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, and thank you Councilor Caraviello for bringing this forward today.

236
00:18:05,777 --> 00:18:14,886
[SPEAKER_10]: I think this resolution is important, obviously we need to make sure that every city vehicle is a safe vehicle, and I support measures to ensure that.

237
00:18:14,906 --> 00:18:19,311
[SPEAKER_10]: I also want to thank Councilor Tseng and President Morell for their

238
00:18:20,157 --> 00:18:40,469
[SPEAKER_10]: amendments, you know, of course, as we all know, resources are finite, needs are many, so I support, you know, I'd be interested to see this purchase plan, a phased in purchasing plan in the context of an overall capital budget, just to see how it interacts with other funding priorities, including other funding priorities within the MPD, which I know are many at this point.

239
00:18:41,772 --> 00:18:50,355
[SPEAKER_10]: I also wanted to note, you know, kind of to President Murrell's point, of course, yearly vehicle purchases, even if they're phased in, they're no small thing environmentally.

240
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:56,117
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, there is a huge emissions cost baked into high volume vehicle manufacturing, you know, even for EV vehicles.

241
00:18:56,157 --> 00:19:01,339
[SPEAKER_10]: So regardless of how this goes forward, obviously, patrol cars are a bit of a non-negotiable.

242
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:07,442
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think that that's something that I'd really like to see acknowledged and accounted for in our overall path to net zero emissions.

243
00:19:07,883 --> 00:19:16,186
[SPEAKER_10]: So just wanted to note that for the record, regardless of how we go forward, I think that'd be a valuable thing for us to, for the administration to consider in their purchase plan of these vehicles.

244
00:19:16,206 --> 00:19:16,707
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

245
00:19:29,652 --> 00:19:30,993
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

246
00:19:31,013 --> 00:19:31,353
[SPEAKER_08]: I think

247
00:19:32,484 --> 00:19:34,406
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Collins made a good statement.

248
00:19:35,066 --> 00:19:36,788
[SPEAKER_08]: Every city vehicle should be a safe vehicle.

249
00:19:36,828 --> 00:19:44,774
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would just like to, if folks are comfortable with this as an amendment, just ask, there's been a shift.

250
00:19:44,974 --> 00:19:47,476
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember when I was younger, we actually had patrol cars.

251
00:19:47,816 --> 00:19:50,838
[SPEAKER_08]: They were cars and now we've moved more to SUVs.

252
00:19:51,519 --> 00:20:00,406
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just would like to amend this to ask going forward, if the plan is to continue with SUV size vehicles and ask why that is.

253
00:20:01,889 --> 00:20:07,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Bears, I think that's all they're making for the police departments right at this particular moment.

254
00:20:07,813 --> 00:20:10,855
[SPEAKER_07]: Very few companies make four-door sedans anymore.

255
00:20:11,256 --> 00:20:16,699
[SPEAKER_07]: So the four-door SUV, small SUV, is the way of most cars in the country.

256
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:25,385
[SPEAKER_07]: I said, I don't think most cars, Ford seems to be the choice of police car, and they no longer make a four-door sedan.

257
00:20:26,146 --> 00:20:30,309
[SPEAKER_07]: So that seems to be the trend in police cars throughout the whole country.

258
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:42,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, and I do see the chief of staff has her hand raised recognizes the chief of staff in this area.

259
00:20:43,234 --> 00:20:52,657
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President, just a couple pieces of information for the council, just as a part of this conversation, just to provide some input.

260
00:20:54,676 --> 00:21:05,084
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to make sure that the we shared with the council that we have free cash requests coming before the council in March, and that would include to police cruisers.

261
00:21:05,825 --> 00:21:12,791
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, that's consistent with the capital plan and also further funding is

262
00:21:13,812 --> 00:21:17,574
[SPEAKER_01]: has been identified for future years for cruisers as well.

263
00:21:17,674 --> 00:21:26,380
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course we are also at the same time need to go through the capital plan, review the further review and update the capital plan at this point.

264
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:37,446
[SPEAKER_01]: So just also can't really comment too much on some of the other comments or questions that have been presented, but certainly electric vehicles sound great.

265
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:38,407
[SPEAKER_01]: Just need to make sure that

266
00:21:39,136 --> 00:21:44,362
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we are able to do that, and I can't speak for the chief to see if there are any operational reasons.

267
00:21:44,843 --> 00:21:47,927
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, all of those things are items.

268
00:21:47,987 --> 00:21:57,298
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure that will be taken into consideration, and we can certainly comment on those at the time in which we come before the council to request the funding from free cash.

269
00:22:09,264 --> 00:22:09,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

270
00:22:09,564 --> 00:22:09,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

271
00:22:09,684 --> 00:22:10,004
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

272
00:22:11,465 --> 00:22:11,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

273
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:52,360
[SPEAKER_09]: seven the affirmative zero and the negative the motion passes Council paper to to 055 offered by Councilor Caraviello be resolved the city council request the administration please provide the council with the findings of its review of the clerk's office along with all legal costs associated counselor caveat.

274
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:53,830
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

275
00:22:54,671 --> 00:23:07,116
[SPEAKER_07]: This is something that we, we had discussed last year when the administration did a review of the clerk's office and they said it was only gonna take a couple of weeks and we're almost at the end of January.

276
00:23:07,757 --> 00:23:22,283

[SPEAKER_07]: Respectfully submitted.

298
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:18,373
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, this is an appropriation request that I support wholeheartedly I certainly have no problem with the appropriations that are requested here by the administration.

299
00:26:19,253 --> 00:26:27,276
[SPEAKER_09]: In particular, the walking clock project, I think we're very lucky to have Jeffrey Driscoll running the Metro Housing Authority, the premier housing authority director in the state of Massachusetts.

300
00:26:27,956 --> 00:26:31,877
[SPEAKER_09]: He's the housing authority director that trains the other housing authority directors across the state.

301
00:26:32,737 --> 00:26:34,078
[SPEAKER_09]: He's done an excellent job he's really.

302
00:26:35,936 --> 00:26:40,917
[SPEAKER_09]: moved our housing authority forward, very similar to the way that Mike Durham has moved that veterans office forward.

303
00:26:40,937 --> 00:26:41,677
[SPEAKER_09]: He's done a great job.

304
00:26:42,197 --> 00:26:43,878
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've been looking at this request.

305
00:26:43,918 --> 00:26:47,718
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this is what the CPA is really intended for.

306
00:26:47,738 --> 00:26:48,439
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a perfect use.

307
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:50,939
[SPEAKER_09]: So with that being said, I support it wholeheartedly.

308
00:26:51,339 --> 00:27:02,461
[SPEAKER_09]: In terms of the Riverbed Park project and the accessibility improvements to Chevallier Auditorium, again, two items that we've been talking about for a long time, two things that I think are important to this community.

309
00:27:02,501 --> 00:27:04,982
[SPEAKER_09]: So without being said, I'd move for approval on the table.

310
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:09,053
[SPEAKER_07]: Second.

311
00:27:09,133 --> 00:27:15,098
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just seconding second second accounts of his console columns.

312
00:27:17,019 --> 00:27:23,604
[SPEAKER_10]: I was also just seconding but I agree with everything and I'd said I think these are four extremely worthy projects, very excited to support them.

313
00:27:28,476 --> 00:27:43,926
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President, yeah I just want to note that for those watching who maybe weren't at our meeting on Wednesday we didn't have a meeting on Wednesday on each of these projects with a great overview on all of them and again I also wholeheartedly support them I think it's a great mix of projects and we did get word from.

314
00:27:44,807 --> 00:27:53,214
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm friends with the CPC that there are other projects that will be forthcoming that they are still reviewing based on the amount of projects that came in and the amount of funding that is available.

315
00:27:53,254 --> 00:28:01,982
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just want to note that there will be more coming because I know if people have been attending those meetings, there's many other very worthy projects and I look forward to those coming before this body.

316
00:28:02,442 --> 00:28:02,803
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

317
00:28:03,743 --> 00:28:05,425
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for myself.

318
00:28:06,065 --> 00:28:06,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

319
00:28:06,506 --> 00:28:11,750
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree wholeheartedly with Councilor Layton on Mr. Driscoll and the housing.

320
00:28:13,164 --> 00:28:17,247
[SPEAKER_07]: Walking quarters goes back to the 1960s and very little money has ever been appropriated there.

321
00:28:18,087 --> 00:28:25,853
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad we're finally going to do something with that, bring it up, bring it up standards and we'll be adding housing there for people who need it.

322
00:28:25,993 --> 00:28:29,155
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, thank you, Jeff, for the great work you do.

323
00:28:29,755 --> 00:28:37,481
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, all these other projects are saying they're all good projects, but I think that one there stands out as the, as the key one of this group.

324
00:28:37,761 --> 00:28:39,242
[SPEAKER_07]: So any further discussion?
