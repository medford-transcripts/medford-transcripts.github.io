    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=6.215s">I</a>  see that he's on zoom vice president bears.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=13.798s">He's</a>  waving hello. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=15.859s">Councilor</a>  Collins? Here. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=18.96s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=20.121s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=21.301s">Councilor</a>  Tseng, President Morell, President, and Councilor Carvaviello.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=27.024s">So</a>  the affirmative please rise to the flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=35.757s">One</a>  nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=40.981s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=43.743s">Motions,</a>  orders, and resolutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=45.505s">22050</a>  offered by Council of Knights. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=49.728s">We</a>  are so resolved that the Medford City Council extend its appreciation, gratitude, and well wishes to the Salvato family, owners and proprietors of Espresso Pizza, <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=59.675s">for</a>  efforts in support of the community spanning over four decades in the city of Method and be it further resolved that the Salvato family be recognized by the city of Method by way of dedicating the corner of Winthrop and Boston Avenue in recognition of the Salvato family. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=75.562s">Councilor</a>  Knight?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=77.0s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much and I know that you and I was supposed to be co sponsors on this I apologize for leaving you off. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=82.988s">I</a>  know that you and I spoke about. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=86.751s">But</a>  it's the Sobato family are owners and operators of Expressos pizzeria on Boston Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=90.854s">Mr.</a>  President, but just that just closed very recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=94.336s">And</a>  for 40 years they operated at that corner and they were one of the first businesses in this community to get an extended hours license. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=101.661s">And</a>  they really set a trend up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=102.962s">They</a>  serviced my neighborhood that I grew up in, as well as I'm sure Councilor Collins will tell us, Tufts University population for a great deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=109.868s">But</a>  they've always been a great neighbor and a great partner in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=112.57s">And</a>  after 40 years, they're hanging up the aprons and the pizza wheel. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=115.892s">So</a>  I think it goes without saying that they deserve some recognition for the community building that they did here in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=121.756s">And</a>  they've offered this community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=124.118s">They're</a>  great people, a great family. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=125.519s">I</a>  had the opportunity to grow up with some nephews, some of our nephews in the Davises as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=130.042s">great</a>  kids, great people, all giving to this community now. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=133.363s">So</a>  with that being said, I'd ask my council colleagues to support this resolution and send it to the administration for the request.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=138.244s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=138.624s">And</a>  personally myself, I want to thank Councilor for putting me on with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=143.024s">I</a>  don't think there's anybody that lives, either went to Tufts or lives in probably most areas of West Medford that haven't had an expresso pizza. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=152.826s">I</a>  mean, Friday, Saturday nights, they used to turn their phone off. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=158.707s">The</a>  calls are coming in so fast and furious. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=162.13s">I</a>  think at one point they had like 17, 18 drivers on the weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=165.634s">So,</a>  good family, been there for many years and I just want to thank them for all the things they've done for our community.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=173.023s">Mr.</a>  President.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=174.104s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=174.865s">Thank</a>  you again. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=175.545s">Thanks</a>  for bringing this forward, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=178.919s">Council</a>  President, this is, this is a family that again you have to celebrate because although they owned a successful business. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=186.229s">They</a>  were always one of the first businesses get back to the youth of the community so often you go in there, and you'd see a new plaque. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=195.219s">express</a>  those representing and sponsoring another youth team or activity. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=199.721s">So</a>  I've had the pleasure to know a lot of this Salvato family, and I know that they've done so much for our community, and I would support and second Councilor Knight's motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=213.865s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=214.806s">Oh,</a>  any further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=216.426s">So</a>  on the motion by Councilor Knight and Councilor Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=226.94s">Vice</a>  President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=228.321s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=231.864s">Councilor</a>  Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=233.165s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=234.146s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=240.694s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=241.495s">Yes,</a>  7 in the affirmative. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=242.915s">Zero</a>  in the negative, motion passes. 22-051, offered by Councilor Knight be a result that the city, the Medford City Council require recordings of all city boards and commissions who are conducting proceedings virtually on the city website for no less than 36 months and be a further resolve that the city solicitor provide a draft ordinance requiring such <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=265.695s">in</a>  search for council deliberation.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=267.997s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=268.778s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=270.139s">I've</a>  gotten a number of complaints recently from members of the community seeking copies of minutes or copies of meetings related to especially the Cannabis Advisory Commission as well as the Historic Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=281.589s">And</a>  these documents or records are not available readily on the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=284.972s">So</a>  after multiple calls, I thought it might make sense for us to reach out to the administration and ask them to take the appropriate steps to ensure that this material gets posted publicly and transparently, and that the council take the appropriate steps to ensure that this is a standard and a norm, not an anomaly.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=299.324s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=299.945s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=301.326s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=302.247s">Mr.</a>  Clark, anybody want to speak?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=304.589s">No</a>  hands raised.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=310.396s">All</a>  right, both in terms of transparency and in terms of community participation, I think this measure is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=317.222s">I</a>  also think it's helpful for our community when we have more people participating so they can give us their ideas and help us reach more innovative solutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=325.369s">So</a>  I definitely support this.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=326.91s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=327.731s">Okay,</a>  so on the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=334.256s">No</a>  further discussion, Mr. Clerk.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=335.817s">Mr.</a>  President.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=338.787s">Mr.</a>  President, I don't have a camera. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=341.768s">So</a>  just speak up if I don't see you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=344.049s">You're</a>  all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=345.469s">I</a>  would just if, if Councilor Knight would be so amenable to amend this to include that minutes be posted, even if the meetings are occurring in person.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=357.152s">We</a>  certainly have no problem with that, sir.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=359.353s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=361.233s">So</a>  on the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli as amended by vice president bears.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=369.053s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=376.916s">Vice</a>  President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=378.336s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=380.557s">Councilor</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=381.478s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=382.798s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=383.578s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=384.038s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=384.839s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=385.339s">Councilor</a>  Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=385.979s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=386.699s">President</a>  Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=387.72s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=387.98s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello-Long. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=390.361s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=392.081s">Semi-affirmative,</a>  none the negative, motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=398.243s">22052</a>  offered by Councilor Knight be it so resolved that the Medford City Council in the executive session for the purpose of discussing the administration's data and IT vulnerabilities as identified in the 111.22 Medford transcript article.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=414.758s">Council</a>  night, Mister President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=417.299s">Yes,</a>  yet again, a nice personnel issue has made its way to the newspaper that's identified a number of issues that are going on here at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=424.862s">One</a>  of those issues, I believe, would be an IP vulnerability. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=427.883s">It's</a>  my understanding that our IT director, after 24 years of employment in the city of Method with an exemplary record, was removed from his position based upon some certain IT vulnerabilities that the council has not been made aware of. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=440.287s">This</a>  is very concerning to me, Mr. President, because of their IT vulnerabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=445.272s">Similar</a>  to what we saw in the past, the administration wouldn't disclose to us when the number of personal information was taken from the city website maybe nine or 10 months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=453.919s">It</a>  just raises cause for concern, number one, and it also raises cause for liability for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=461.805s">And</a>  if there's going to be a liability that's placed upon the city, it's going to end up costing the city money, and the council should know about it, because we're the steward of the taxpayer dollar. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=469.193s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, I'd ask that this motion to move forward that we set up an executive session with the city administration for us to discuss these it vulnerabilities to see what steps we need to take to ensure that the personal information and data of the taxpayers in this community is protected appropriately.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=482.942s">Second.</a> </p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=483.662s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=484.823s">Um,</a>  any further discussion.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=490.695s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=491.396s">Yeah,</a>  I support this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=493.957s">And</a>  I can just work just to make sure that this notice is narrowly worded because if we do, if we were to, we don't want to, if we were to venture into the personnel, then we would have to make sure that we're inviting the proper people. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=506.666s">So</a>  making sure it's worded in a way that we're getting the update on the IT vulnerabilities and not in a personnel sense is my opinion and just the need to make sure it's properly noticed.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=517.954s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=519.075s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=521.049s">So</a>  on the motion by Councilor Knight seconded by Councilor Scott belly. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=525.93s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the role.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=563.501s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=565.001s">Litigation</a>  and representation has been the topic of discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=568.962s">Most</a>  of those terms so far, Mr. President, for the last four or five weeks, that's all we've been talking about is litigation and representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=575.425s">And</a>  recently, this council passed a money bill to amend the fiscal year budget to allow the mayor's private legal counsel to really have an open checkbook for litigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=590.023s">And</a>  when we look at what's going on here in the community and you think about the litigation that's pending, <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=594.426s">and</a>  the amount of money that's been appropriated, and whether or not that amount of money is going to be able to stretch to cover the issues that are in dispute right now, it raises some concern for me financially. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=604.951s">So</a>  when you think about the more than 25 labor charges that are against the city right now, when you think about the 340 developments that the city's fighting right now, that doesn't look like we're fighting a winning battle. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=616.936s">When</a>  you look at the potential <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=619.552s">issue</a>  with the cannabis advisory commission in the conflict of interest concerning one of the members of the selection committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=626.135s">It</a>  just puts me in a position as the president to sit here and think about what we're doing with our money and whether or not we should be planning appropriately for future spending. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=636.38s">You</a>  know since this term started I think we've spent a lot of dough in 4 or 5 weeks and I'm hoping that you know we can kind of responsibly manage <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=649.048s">our</a>  budgets, our plans, our finances. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=651.829s">And</a>  I think that by establishing a subcommittee on litigation, that will give the council a better idea going forward as to what steps we need to take to fund the law department in an appropriate fashion to ensure that we secure our legal representation moving forward, to be sure that we secure our zoning consultant moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=668.675s">So</a>  I think that this will help us address a number of the concerns and issues that we've raised, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=672.276s">May</a>  I ask for my council colleagues' support?</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=674.597s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=676.798s">Any</a>  discussion on this matter? <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=679.158s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=681.319s">Mr.</a>  Clark any customer or what comes up is, I think, see any hands raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=687.321s">It's</a>  me. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=687.942s">It's</a>  Council.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=691.783s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=693.604s">Definitely</a>  support the intent of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=695.805s">If</a>  the Councilor would be so amenable to refer this to the committee on rules and ordinances I think we could have the discussion in there by the end of February and get this set up.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=707.612s">If</a>  I'm with me, I know that the president's strong pencil also has the power to strike and create the subcommittees as we discussed at the beginning of the session, but I personally have no objections. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=719.156s">What</a>  direction this council chooses to go with that direction, I want to go for transparency purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=723.578s">So</a>  be it, I have no problem with that whatsoever.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=727.159s">Then</a>  I would move to refer to that committee on ordinances and rules.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=731.801s">So</a>  Councilor Bears has moved to move this to where, I'm sorry, Vice President Baez.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=736.483s">the</a>  subcommittee on ordinances and rules.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=740.324s">Move</a>  to ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=742.484s">Subcommittee</a>  on ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=746.965s">So,</a>  the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, and as amended by Councilor Bears to move this to the subcommittee on ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=763.528s">So,</a>  Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=793.801s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=794.601s">I'll</a>  give you a moment to get back to your chair.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=808.971s">Paper</a>  22054 offered by Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=812.793s">Be</a>  it resolved the Medford City Council will have the mayor start looking into purchasing vehicles for the Medford Police Department, most patrol cars are now four plus years old with high mileage. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=820.656s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=822.677s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=824.677s">Mr.</a>  President, this is something that's been discussed over many, many, many times in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=831.8s">I</a>  think four years ago, we purchased a whole bunch of new cars, and all those cars now have over 100,000 miles on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=838.942s">I</a>  remember at the time we talked about setting up a plan where we be purchasing cars every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=845.625s">So</a>  we're not in a point like this where we have to go out and buy seven or eight cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=852.047s">And</a>  again, that plan never materialized. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=855.268s">So</a>  at this point, I'm asking us, I'm asking the administration to set up a plan to buy police cars every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=865.239s">No,</a>  you don't have to buy 10 a year, but if you move two or three every year, we're not in the dream world now. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=870.683s">So</a>  we don't have all these cars sitting there with hundreds of thousands of miles, even though we have an in-house mechanic. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=876.087s">We're</a>  just spending money repairing cars, because these are cars that run 24 hours a day, seven days a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=881.369s">So</a>  I asked the administration to look into this purchase, especially where cars are in high demand right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=888.651s">It</a>  may take you longer than normal to even maybe even find a car, if there are any police cars available. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=893.912s">So</a>  I asked the mayor to look into this, and for the administration to come up with a plan <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=900.135s">We're</a>  constantly purchasing cars every year, one or two at a time, so we don't have to do this backlog of waiting to do this.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=914.476s">Thank</a>  you for introducing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=916.498s">I</a>  know there are constituents out there who may be skeptical, right, of given national trends or national discussions, but I think we should look at the history here in our city, and we should look at the fact that our cars are over 100,000, you know, the mileage is over 100,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=933.869s">Those</a>  are the new ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=935.19s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=936.731s">And</a>  so, and 100,000 for clarity is usually the median of where cars start to be, patrol vehicles start to be replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=944.736s">And</a>  so, in order, you know, I think this is a reasonable request, although if the council would be so amenable, if, if you'd be able to amend this to say that we come up with a that the city administration come up with the capital, a complete capital plan.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=963.627s">So,</a>  so that it's, I don't have a problem with us coming up with a complete capital plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=968.831s">That'll</a>  take some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=970.152s">Of</a>  course, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=971.352s">But,</a>  you know, but I'd like to come up with a plan just for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=973.634s">Like</a>  I said, I don't have a problem with this being part of a capital plan.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=977.517s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=978.137s">And</a>  as a second amendment of mine would be to make sure that we are <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=984.501s">exploring</a>  patrol vehicle policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=987.943s">This</a>  is something I've done a little bit of research on just looking into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=991.424s">It</a>  seems that in municipalities across the country, the cities have negotiated deals with police unions, with the police officers where, you know, the police have a little bit more agency and a little bit more initiative. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1006.752s">And</a>  this research has shown that <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1009.963s">the</a>  longevity of patrol vehicles is longer and that cities save up on costs a little bit more. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1017.008s">I'm</a>  talking about cities, Miami is a very big example of one, but these policies are pretty common in the Midwest and the South. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1025.975s">And</a>  I would just ask that the city administration explore some of these policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1030.018s">We</a>  don't have to adopt anything, but I think it'd be worth our time to explore. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1033.681s">Right,</a>  no problem.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1039.008s">Mr.</a>  President, if I could.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1050.751s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1052.573s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1054.494s">I'm</a>  curious, I would like to amend if you'd be amenable, just to also include any updates, get an update from the administration on seeking hybrid or EV vehicles to meet these needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1066.344s">I</a>  know I brought up both budgets. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1067.705s">The</a>  chief has said it's something he's looking into. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1069.247s">I'm</a>  just curious any progress we've had on that.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1073.67s">That's</a>  not a problem.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1082.193s">Thank</a>  you, and thank you Councilor Caraviello for bringing this forward today. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1085.777s">I</a>  think this resolution is important, obviously we need to make sure that every city vehicle is a safe vehicle, and I support measures to ensure that. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1094.906s">I</a>  also want to thank Councilor Tseng and President Morell for their <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1100.157s">amendments,</a>  you know, of course, as we all know, resources are finite, needs are many, so I support, you know, I'd be interested to see this purchase plan, a phased in purchasing plan in the context of an overall capital budget, just to see how it interacts with other funding priorities, including other funding priorities within the MPD, which I know are many at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1121.772s">I</a>  also wanted to note, you know, kind of to President Morell's point, of course, yearly vehicle purchases, even if they're phased in, they're no small thing environmentally. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1130.395s">And,</a>  you know, there is a huge emissions cost baked into high volume vehicle manufacturing, you know, even for EV vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1136.157s">So</a>  regardless of how this goes forward, obviously, patrol cars are a bit of a non-negotiable. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1141.86s">But</a>  I think that that's something that I'd really like to see acknowledged and accounted for in our overall path to net zero emissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1147.883s">So</a>  just wanted to note that for the record, regardless of how we go forward, I think that'd be a valuable thing for us to, for the administration to consider in their purchase plan of these vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1156.206s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1169.652s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1171.013s">I</a>  think <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1172.484s">Councilor</a>  Collins made a good statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1175.066s">Every</a>  city vehicle should be a safe vehicle. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1176.828s">And</a>  I would just like to, if folks are comfortable with this as an amendment, just ask, there's been a shift. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1184.974s">I</a>  remember when I was younger, we actually had patrol cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1187.816s">They</a>  were cars and now we've moved more to SUVs. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1191.519s">And</a>  I just would like to amend this to ask going forward, if the plan is to continue with SUV size vehicles and ask why that is.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1201.889s">Councilor</a>  Bears, I think that's all they're making for the police departments right at this particular moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1207.813s">Very</a>  few companies make four-door sedans anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1211.256s">So</a>  the four-door SUV, small SUV, is the way of most cars in the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1217.5s">I</a>  said, I don't think most cars, Ford seems to be the choice of police car, and they no longer make a four-door sedan. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1226.146s">So</a>  that seems to be the trend in police cars throughout the whole country.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1231.55s">Thank</a>  you, and I do see the chief of staff has her hand raised recognizes the chief of staff in this area.</p>

    <p>[Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1243.234s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President, just a couple pieces of information for the council, just as a part of this conversation, just to provide some input. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1254.676s">wanted</a>  to make sure that the we shared with the council that we have free cash requests coming before the council in March, and that would include to police cruisers. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1265.825s">And</a>  also, that's consistent with the capital plan and also further funding is <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1273.812s">has</a>  been identified for future years for cruisers as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1277.674s">But</a>  of course we are also at the same time need to go through the capital plan, review the further review and update the capital plan at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1286.46s">So</a>  just also can't really comment too much on some of the other comments or questions that have been presented, but certainly electric vehicles sound great. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1297.546s">Just</a>  need to make sure that <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1299.136s">Um,</a>  we are able to do that, and I can't speak for the chief to see if there are any operational reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1304.843s">But</a>  you know, all of those things are items. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1307.987s">I'm</a>  sure that will be taken into consideration, and we can certainly comment on those at the time in which we come before the council to request the funding from free cash.</p>
