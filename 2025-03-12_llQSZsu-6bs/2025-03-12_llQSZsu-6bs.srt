[SPEAKER_52]: He was a deeply caring person who spent his personal and professional lives, making a positive impact on people through his work in medical care and his loyalty.

00:00:29,854 --> 00:00:30,294
[SPEAKER_52]: I'm going to start.

00:00:30,334 --> 00:00:31,634
[SPEAKER_52]: I'm going to start again.

5
00:00:31,654 --> 00:00:44,520
[SPEAKER_52]: Thank you.

00:00:55,536 --> 00:01:01,861
[SPEAKER_52]: Be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we send our deepest condolences to the family, friends, and loved ones of Maxwell Leiner.

7
00:01:02,842 --> 00:01:10,869
[SPEAKER_52]: Max was my friend of over 15 years, and together we were both graduates of the Medford High School class of 2011 and University of Massachusetts Amherst class of 2015.

8
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:21,477
[SPEAKER_52]: He was a deeply caring person who spent his personal and professional lives making a positive impact on people through his work in medical care and his loyalty and devotion to family and friends.

00:01:22,258 --> 00:01:24,900
[SPEAKER_52]: Be it further resolved that we dedicate this meeting in his honor.

10
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:26,920
[SPEAKER_52]: President Bears.

11
00:01:31,603 --> 00:01:34,345
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you, Vice President Collins for reading this resolution.

12
00:01:36,506 --> 00:01:37,947
[SPEAKER_47]: I lost a friend who's very close to me.

13
00:01:37,967 --> 00:01:43,330
[SPEAKER_47]: A lot of people in this city are very sad that he passed away.

14
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:45,472
[SPEAKER_47]: It's obviously hard to talk about.

15
00:01:45,492 --> 00:01:51,555
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm not going to speak too much about it because I think we're going to be here for a few hours and I want to be able to run this meeting.

16
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:53,877
[SPEAKER_47]: But I appreciate

17
00:01:55,394 --> 00:02:07,261
[SPEAKER_47]: all the support that people have said over the past week, and my thoughts are with his family and our Medford High School class of 2011, who is missing him very much.

18
00:02:07,741 --> 00:02:08,101
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

19
00:02:11,243 --> 00:02:12,083
[SPEAKER_52]: Thank you, President Bears.

20
00:02:14,224 --> 00:02:15,445
[SPEAKER_52]: Any further comment from Councilors?

21
00:02:17,464 --> 00:02:24,369
[SPEAKER_52]: I will just say, only knowing a little bit about Maxwell, what a deep, deep loss that our community has suffered through his untimely passing.

22
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:29,433
[SPEAKER_52]: We are going to dedicate this meeting and its offer, and I'd like for us to all stand for a moment of silence.

23
00:02:44,945 --> 00:02:45,205

[SPEAKER_52]: Shall I continue.

28
00:03:04,707 --> 00:03:13,171
[SPEAKER_52]: All right, reports of committees to five dash 023 offered by George Scarpelli city councilor education and culture committee, February 25 2025.

29
00:03:21,015 --> 00:03:21,275
[SPEAKER_52]: Thank you.

30
00:03:21,295 --> 00:03:24,196
[SPEAKER_52]: You can see I don't run meetings very often.

31
00:03:25,036 --> 00:03:28,998
[SPEAKER_52]: The records of the February 25th meeting were passed to Councilor Leming.

32
00:03:29,118 --> 00:03:30,098
[SPEAKER_52]: Councilor Leming, how did you find them?

33
00:03:33,699 --> 00:03:33,959
[SPEAKER_52]: Thank you.

34
00:03:33,979 --> 00:03:37,981

38
00:03:48,664 --> 00:03:50,005
[SPEAKER_52]: Who is the vice chair for this committee?

39
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:57,057
[SPEAKER_52]: May I recognize you to give a brief summary of this meeting?

40
00:03:58,528 --> 00:03:59,328
[SPEAKER_53]: Yes, thanks.

41
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:01,489
[SPEAKER_53]: We had a really great meeting.

42
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:05,972
[SPEAKER_53]: We invited the parents of students with disabilities to come and speak.

43
00:04:06,572 --> 00:04:18,338
[SPEAKER_53]: We discussed possibilities of how Medford can provide more activities for their children, covered many things between having it through the rec department and having it through more of a citywide effort.

44
00:04:19,518 --> 00:04:26,081
[SPEAKER_53]: And I think that was the discussion and we're moving forward with trying to support those children here in Medford.

45
00:04:27,823 --> 00:04:34,450
[SPEAKER_52]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan on the motion by Councilor Callahan to approve seconded by Councilor Tseng all in favor.

46
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:46,161
[SPEAKER_47]: All opposed motion passes to 4033 offered by Vice President Collins planning and permitting committee February 26 2025 report to follow.

47
00:04:52,866 --> 00:05:05,368
[SPEAKER_52]: Thank you President Bears this was our final of four meetings in the planning and permitting committee on the neighborhood and urban residential topic which proposes an updated and modernized framework for residential neighborhoods of the city.

48
00:05:06,229 --> 00:05:10,489
[SPEAKER_52]: Like I mentioned, it was preceded by three other topics during which we workshop this proposal.

49
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:18,911
[SPEAKER_52]: And at the February 26 meeting we referred it out to the city council for its immediate procedural referral to the Community Development Board for further

50
00:05:19,491 --> 00:05:29,835
[SPEAKER_52]: public meetings, public feedback and promulgation of recommendations motion to approve on the motion to approve of Vice President Collins seconded by seconded by Councilor Callahan.

51
00:05:30,155 --> 00:05:40,979
[SPEAKER_47]: All those in favor, I oppose the motion passes to 4468 offered by Councilor Tseng committee of the whole March 4 2025 report to follow I guess technically this should be me but I'll go to you.

52
00:05:43,761 --> 00:05:44,461
[SPEAKER_35]: Any combo works.

53
00:05:45,661 --> 00:05:47,862
[SPEAKER_35]: This will be on our agenda later tonight.

54
00:05:48,022 --> 00:05:56,484
[SPEAKER_35]: So I don't want to go too much in depth into it, but the committee of the whole reviewed the draft charter as amended by the governance committee.

55
00:05:56,904 --> 00:05:59,325
[SPEAKER_35]: We made a few more technical amendments.

56
00:05:59,365 --> 00:06:12,208
[SPEAKER_35]: We also had a very long three and a half hour conversation on board representation and what that looks like and sent the draft to this regular meeting.

57
00:06:13,357 --> 00:06:13,997
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you, Councilor Leming.

58
00:06:14,037 --> 00:06:19,799
[SPEAKER_47]: On the motion to approve the committee report by Councilor Tseng, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

59
00:06:19,999 --> 00:06:20,739
[SPEAKER_47]: All those in favor?

60
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:21,880
[SPEAKER_47]: Opposed?

61
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:22,740
[SPEAKER_47]: Motion passes.

62
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,922
[SPEAKER_47]: Now to Councilor Leming.

63
00:06:27,942 --> 00:06:32,863
[SPEAKER_47]: 24069, 24073, 24354, offered by Councilor Leming, Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee, March 5th, 2025.

64
00:06:33,763 --> 00:06:41,806
[SPEAKER_47]: I can't, I don't know if there's something going on, but this is Councilor Leming, March 5th, 2025, Resident Services and Public Engagement, Councilor Leming.

65
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:54,378
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you at the President services and public engagement committee, we talked about current one second got quieter.

66
00:06:55,854 --> 00:07:10,482
[SPEAKER_41]: But we discussed the current draft of the Human Rights Commission updated ordinance and ended up deciding to continue that on to the next meeting.

67
00:07:10,502 --> 00:07:12,924
[SPEAKER_41]: I'd like to thank my colleague, Councilor Tseng for his work on that.

68
00:07:14,364 --> 00:07:28,671
[SPEAKER_41]: We then discussed some of the recent listening sessions that Councilors have been holding at the Medford Senior Center, as well as just comparing notes on them and coming up with ways to improve these.

69
00:07:29,611 --> 00:07:42,337
[SPEAKER_41]: And we worked on the February Medford City Council newsletter, which can now be found on the Medford City Council webpage if you're interested in reading it.

70
00:07:42,817 --> 00:07:43,117
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you.

71
00:07:44,336 --> 00:07:47,000
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you on the motion of Councilor Leming to approve, seconded by.

72
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:49,403
[SPEAKER_47]: Seconded by Councilor Tseng, all those in favor?

73
00:07:50,064 --> 00:07:50,464
[SPEAKER_47]: Opposed?

74
00:07:50,525 --> 00:07:51,386
[SPEAKER_47]: Motion passes.

75
00:07:52,527 --> 00:07:53,689
[SPEAKER_47]: Councilor Lazzaro.

76
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:58,235
[SPEAKER_51]: Motion to suspend the rules and take paper 25-043 out of order.

77
00:08:01,223 --> 00:08:06,871
[SPEAKER_47]: On the motion of councils are to take paper to 5043 out of order seconded by Councilor Tseng all those in favor.

78
00:08:07,311 --> 00:08:14,962
[SPEAKER_47]: I opposed motion passes to 4053 petition for amendment to a common victors license by Mrs. Murphy's.

79
00:08:16,697 --> 00:08:23,784
[SPEAKER_47]: Excuse me, Mrs. Murphy's is requesting Barry Rafferty writing seeking to extend business hours to 1am.

80
00:08:24,405 --> 00:08:31,672
[SPEAKER_47]: As you're aware liquor license already allows for that and it's crucial for my business, we find ourselves particularly on Chevalier nights asking our customers to vacate the premises.

81
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:33,653
[SPEAKER_47]: and it is upsetting for all parties.

82
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:35,875
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you for your consideration, best, Barry Rafferty.

83
00:08:36,615 --> 00:08:44,461
[SPEAKER_47]: And I also note for the discussion from the clerk is that there's especially a desire for them to be open late on St.

84
00:08:44,481 --> 00:08:45,202
[SPEAKER_47]: Patrick's Day.

85
00:08:45,262 --> 00:08:46,403
[SPEAKER_47]: This is their first St.

86
00:08:46,423 --> 00:08:48,945
[SPEAKER_47]: Patrick's Day open in Medford Square.

87
00:08:50,026 --> 00:08:51,907
[SPEAKER_47]: So I'll go to Barry, who I now see is here.

88
00:08:52,427 --> 00:08:54,609
[SPEAKER_47]: If he wants to share anything, yes, if you don't mind.

89
00:08:54,869 --> 00:08:59,553
[SPEAKER_47]: If he wants to share anything more, and then I can talk a little bit about where we are procedurally with all of this.

90
00:09:01,367 --> 00:09:02,068
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President.

91
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:08,092
[SPEAKER_18]: So, in truth, the ABCC, you know, they give us a license until 1am.

92
00:09:08,832 --> 00:09:13,236
[SPEAKER_18]: I would hope to get to there as quickly as possible.

93
00:09:13,796 --> 00:09:18,339
[SPEAKER_18]: It does put us at a disadvantage in relation to what you just specified.

94
00:09:18,359 --> 00:09:25,745
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, there's people coming from outside of Medford looking for a drink post-show, and we're not in a situation where we can

95
00:09:26,658 --> 00:09:27,718
[SPEAKER_18]: We can help them with that.

96
00:09:28,199 --> 00:09:30,239
[SPEAKER_18]: On top of which, as you stated, it is St.

97
00:09:30,259 --> 00:09:31,080
[SPEAKER_18]: Patrick's week.

98
00:09:33,561 --> 00:09:34,261
[SPEAKER_18]: It used to be St.

99
00:09:34,281 --> 00:09:34,861
[SPEAKER_18]: Patrick's Day.

100
00:09:34,901 --> 00:09:35,321
[SPEAKER_18]: It'll be St.

101
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:37,062
[SPEAKER_18]: Patrick's month next year, perhaps.

102
00:09:38,302 --> 00:09:40,603
[SPEAKER_18]: But, you know, you know, let's be clear.

103
00:09:41,383 --> 00:09:42,964
[SPEAKER_18]: Closing the doors at 11 a.m.

104
00:09:44,164 --> 00:09:47,866
[SPEAKER_18]: I would like that decision to be mine as against being told to do it.

105
00:09:48,746 --> 00:09:50,747
[SPEAKER_18]: I may well do that, but.

106
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:56,766
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, if there's a demand and people want more and they're being well behaved, I'd like to be in a position to do that.

107
00:09:57,386 --> 00:09:58,347
[SPEAKER_47]: Great, thank you.

108
00:09:59,487 --> 00:10:10,613
[SPEAKER_47]: So I will note that the clerk's office and the planning office have reviewed the city's zoning and special permits for extended hours for restaurants are not for our zoning.

109
00:10:10,793 --> 00:10:13,535
[SPEAKER_47]: All we need to do here is amend common victors licenses.

110
00:10:14,816 --> 00:10:18,638
[SPEAKER_47]: In terms of doing that going forward, the clerk's office and the planning department are working to develop

111
00:10:19,414 --> 00:10:20,575
[SPEAKER_47]: a set of paperwork for that.

112
00:10:22,037 --> 00:10:22,837
[SPEAKER_47]: It's not done yet.

113
00:10:23,118 --> 00:10:25,440
[SPEAKER_47]: So that's why we're, we have this email from you right here.

114
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:32,907
[SPEAKER_47]: I know you've filled out a ton of forms for the city and wouldn't have minded filling out one more, but that's why this is presented the way it's being presented right now.

115
00:10:34,048 --> 00:10:37,071
[SPEAKER_47]: So with that, I will turn it over to councillors for discussion.

116
00:10:37,212 --> 00:10:38,373
[SPEAKER_47]: Councilor Lazzaro.

117
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:54,911
[SPEAKER_51]: I think this is a great moment to begin talking about the potential for Medford Square to have some restaurants that are open a little bit later, especially when we have shows at the Chevalier and holidays where it's appropriate.

118
00:10:55,031 --> 00:10:56,412
[SPEAKER_51]: So I would motion to approve.

119
00:10:56,452 --> 00:10:58,694
[SPEAKER_51]: I think it's perfectly fine and normal.

120
00:10:59,194 --> 00:10:59,474
[SPEAKER_51]: Thank you.

121
00:11:00,955 --> 00:11:01,196
[SPEAKER_47]: Great.

122
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:07,980
[SPEAKER_47]: Council Lazzaro has moved to approve the amendment to the common mixers license to extend the hours to 1 a.m.

123
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:11,131
[SPEAKER_47]: I got a second from Councilor Tseng.

124
00:11:11,151 --> 00:11:12,031
[SPEAKER_47]: Would you like to speak on it?

125
00:11:14,992 --> 00:11:15,312
[SPEAKER_47]: Okay.

126
00:11:15,973 --> 00:11:16,693
[SPEAKER_47]: Everyone wants a second.

127
00:11:17,113 --> 00:11:20,334
[SPEAKER_47]: Is there any further discussion by members of the Council on the motion to approve?

128
00:11:22,055 --> 00:11:23,976
[SPEAKER_47]: Seeing none, is there any discussion by members of the public?

129
00:11:24,136 --> 00:11:30,999
[SPEAKER_47]: If you want to say anything else, Barry, or if there's anyone else who'd like to say anything, you can either make a line behind the podium or raise your hand on Zoom.

130
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,620
[SPEAKER_47]: None from Barry.

131
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,541
[SPEAKER_47]: He said his piece.

132
00:11:35,701 --> 00:11:36,101
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

133
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,562
[SPEAKER_47]: Anyone else want to comment on this vote?

134
00:11:41,997 --> 00:11:42,497
[SPEAKER_47]: We got one.

135
00:11:45,698 --> 00:11:46,019
[SPEAKER_47]: Okay.

136
00:11:46,719 --> 00:11:48,119
[SPEAKER_47]: We've got some people in favor.

137
00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:49,060
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

138
00:11:52,581 --> 00:11:55,262
[SPEAKER_47]: Nice to start on something I think we can seemingly all agree on.

139
00:11:57,723 --> 00:11:59,644
[SPEAKER_47]: I think no hands on zoom.

140
00:11:59,904 --> 00:12:04,546
[SPEAKER_47]: So, no further discussion by members of the council on the motion.

141

[SPEAKER_47]: The Community Development Board held a public hearing across three meetings on this matter in January, February, and March.

[SPEAKER_47]: The City Council opened its public hearing February 11 2025 and continue to this meeting, March 11 2025.

158
00:14:44,928 --> 00:14:50,451
[SPEAKER_47]: We have two papers before us tonight, paper 24515 and 24499.

00:14:50,511 --> 00:14:56,334
[SPEAKER_47]: The first is 515 on the Salem Street neighborhood quarter district and 499 on the green score.

162
00:15:11,522 --> 00:15:15,305
[SPEAKER_47]: open the public hearing on each item.

163
00:15:15,345 --> 00:15:16,485
[SPEAKER_47]: Well, I'm gonna open the public hearing.

164
00:15:17,286 --> 00:15:23,450
[SPEAKER_47]: We'll hear first on Salem Street, and then we'll hear from councillors from the public.

165
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:33,617
[SPEAKER_47]: There'll be motions made, and we'll take a vote on that, and I will close the public hearing portion of the public hearing on Salem Street, and then we'll move to the portion of the public hearing on the green score.

166
00:15:34,577 --> 00:15:35,899
[SPEAKER_47]: and follow the same process.

167
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:44,067
[SPEAKER_47]: So with that, I'm going to reopen the public hearing and recognize Vice President Collins, Vice President Collins.

168
00:15:45,849 --> 00:15:48,211
[SPEAKER_52]: Thank you so much, President Bears, for the overview.

169
00:15:51,467 --> 00:15:53,468
[SPEAKER_52]: I know a lot of people are here tonight for this topic.

170
00:15:53,508 --> 00:15:55,370
[SPEAKER_52]: I'm really excited that we've made it to this point.

171
00:15:55,410 --> 00:16:01,093
[SPEAKER_52]: I'm excited that so many people are here engaging with the comprehensive zoning overhaul.

172
00:16:01,574 --> 00:16:04,156
[SPEAKER_52]: Before we get into discussion, I'm sure there will be a lot of discussion.

173
00:16:04,176 --> 00:16:12,821
[SPEAKER_52]: I want to give a brief overview of the proposal before us, how we got to this point, the meetings that we had, what the proposal says.

174
00:16:12,841 --> 00:16:19,406
[SPEAKER_52]: I'm then going to ask President Bears to recognize Emily Innis from Innes Associates to walk us through on a more

175
00:16:20,006 --> 00:16:21,207
[SPEAKER_52]: the planning and permitting committee meetings.

176
00:16:21,227 --> 00:16:30,132
[SPEAKER_52]: Detail technically technical level and overview of the proposal before us tonight now that it's come back from the CD board, and then I am eager to hear discussion from my fellow Councilors and from the community.

177
00:16:32,193 --> 00:16:36,056
[SPEAKER_52]: So I'll start with a quick outline of the public meetings on this topic that got us to today.

178
00:16:36,636 --> 00:16:41,178
[SPEAKER_52]: This proposal was developed as all of the other zoning proposals were in this process.

179
00:16:41,939 --> 00:16:43,620
[SPEAKER_52]: Um in the planning and permitting

180
00:16:49,223 --> 00:16:53,605
[SPEAKER_52]: The CDB began its public hearing on this topic on January 22nd.

181
00:16:54,045 --> 00:16:58,387
[SPEAKER_52]: That is a step that we always take with any zoning proposal or any zoning change or amendment.

182
00:16:58,727 --> 00:17:06,130
[SPEAKER_52]: It always goes from the city council to the CDB board for their public hearings before it comes back to the city council and that's what that last step is what's happening tonight.

183
00:17:07,452 --> 00:17:10,333
[SPEAKER_52]: but the CDB began its public hearing on January 22nd.

184
00:17:10,994 --> 00:17:12,314
[SPEAKER_52]: There was a lot of community feedback.

185
00:17:12,354 --> 00:17:13,395
[SPEAKER_52]: A lot of people in this room know.

186
00:17:13,915 --> 00:17:20,838
[SPEAKER_52]: So the public hearing was continued to March 5th to allow more time for the board to consider and deliberate and to allow for more opportunities for public comment.

187
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:26,201
[SPEAKER_52]: In the interim, we added a new step to our review timeline, which is a public Q&A.

188
00:17:26,241 --> 00:17:27,641
[SPEAKER_52]: We had that on February 10th.

189
00:17:28,482 --> 00:17:31,463
[SPEAKER_52]: This wasn't something that we did for our phase one zoning updates.

190
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:35,565
[SPEAKER_52]: It wasn't something that we did for the Mystic Avenue corridor district proposal, which passed in December.

191
00:17:36,353 --> 00:17:40,456
[SPEAKER_52]: But with Salem Street, we heard really loud, really clear that people wanted more information.

192
00:17:40,496 --> 00:17:42,417
[SPEAKER_52]: They wanted more opportunities to ask questions.

193
00:17:42,857 --> 00:17:44,918
[SPEAKER_52]: They wanted more opportunities to give public comment.

194
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:55,765
[SPEAKER_52]: So I want to thank city staff and Innes Associates for their flexibility and making sure that we got a local in-person Q&A on the calendar, which I understand a lot of residents attended, and I'm so glad that they did.

195
00:17:57,106 --> 00:18:02,252
[SPEAKER_52]: On March 5th, the CDB had the continuation of its public hearing on the Salem Street Corridor District.

196
00:18:02,853 --> 00:18:13,565
[SPEAKER_52]: They reviewed updated recommendations from the zoning consultant that were put forward after all of the public feedback that was heard on February 10th, and they heard additional public comment on that night.

197
00:18:14,386 --> 00:18:15,507
[SPEAKER_52]: So that brings us to today.

198
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:28,215
[SPEAKER_52]: And in addition to this public meetings, these public meetings, they also want to note, I know for I as one Councilor, I've been receiving a lot of public feedback throughout the process of the zoning, through emails, through phone calls, through texts.

199
00:18:28,795 --> 00:18:30,496
[SPEAKER_52]: I'm sure that all of my colleagues have too.

200
00:18:30,937 --> 00:18:34,059
[SPEAKER_52]: And I want to again, thank everybody for engaging with us on this topic.

201
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:37,881
[SPEAKER_52]: And I hope that you'll continue to do so as we approach other topics through the spring.

202
00:18:39,987 --> 00:18:46,889
[SPEAKER_52]: Another important part of this process, I think, are the new resources that we added during the Salem Street phase of the zoning overhaul.

203
00:18:48,430 --> 00:19:01,274
[SPEAKER_52]: While Salem Street was working its way through the committee to CBB back to City Council process, city staff have worked alongside myself and President Bears to overhaul the communications and online resources that we publish about zoning.

204
00:19:02,175 --> 00:19:05,999
[SPEAKER_52]: creating new ones and making sure that we're using all of the communication channels that the city has.

205
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:18,795
[SPEAKER_52]: We spent many hours on a total redesign of the zoning website so that it's easier for residents to learn about proposals, upcoming meeting dates, look at visuals and graphics, and separate fact from fiction.

206
00:19:19,495 --> 00:19:41,643
[SPEAKER_52]: I say it a lot, I know that zoning is really detailed, it's really technical, it's often confusing, and not just for residents, for city staff and Councilors alike, but I also know that Medford residents don't scare off that easy, and I'm really glad that the community has encouraged us to overhaul the information that we have online so that it's easier for residents to be informed and involved, and we're continuing to work with the mayor's office to keep making that better and better.

207
00:19:42,924 --> 00:19:44,705
[SPEAKER_52]: So onto this specific proposal.

208
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:51,693
[SPEAKER_52]: I will give a high level like I said I'll give a high level overview of what's before us before Emily will walk us through more of the details.

209
00:19:52,533 --> 00:19:58,299
[SPEAKER_52]: The Salem Street corridor district proposal is one part of our comprehensive and citywide zoning overhaul.

210
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,761
[SPEAKER_52]: This began in the spring of 2024.

211
00:20:01,342 --> 00:20:07,046
[SPEAKER_52]: Green Score and the Salem Street Corridor District are the third and fourth major packages to come out of this process.

212
00:20:07,066 --> 00:20:12,049
[SPEAKER_52]: They were predated by the phase one technical updates and the Mystic Ave Corridor District proposal.

213
00:20:12,989 --> 00:20:22,775
[SPEAKER_52]: Overall, the goal of this process is to take the goals and the visions of the Housing Production Plan, the Comprehensive Plan, and the Climate Action and Adaptation Plan and help make them real in our community.

214
00:20:23,512 --> 00:20:25,453
[SPEAKER_52]: These plans were not written by the city council.

215
00:20:25,573 --> 00:20:26,794
[SPEAKER_52]: They didn't come out of this room.

216
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:31,998
[SPEAKER_52]: These plans were the product of years of community feedback, community meetings, and community feedback.

217
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:35,400
[SPEAKER_52]: They speak to our shared goals for the future that we all love.

218
00:20:36,081 --> 00:20:39,063
[SPEAKER_52]: A future of the city where there are homes for young adults who can afford to settle.

219
00:20:39,843 --> 00:20:43,745
[SPEAKER_52]: Apartments where students and workers can live comfortably and where our elders can downsize.

220
00:20:44,245 --> 00:20:51,689
[SPEAKER_52]: Neighborhood squares that are lively and full of businesses and people running errands and meeting friends close to where they live and where we are more climate resilient than we are today.

221
00:20:52,729 --> 00:20:55,250
[SPEAKER_52]: So what do these goals look like for Salem Street specifically?

222
00:20:55,511 --> 00:20:57,652
[SPEAKER_52]: How does this end up in the proposal that we're talking about tonight?

223
00:20:58,692 --> 00:21:05,654
[SPEAKER_52]: This proposal allows for moderately increased residential housing on Salem Street from the 93 Rotary up through Haines Square.

224
00:21:06,435 --> 00:21:09,956
[SPEAKER_52]: We can do that by regulating density, height, and lot size principally.

225
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:13,277
[SPEAKER_52]: By-right densities are moderately changing.

226
00:21:13,977 --> 00:21:17,758
[SPEAKER_52]: By-right heights are also moderately changing, but they are not always increasing.

227
00:21:18,699 --> 00:21:22,400
[SPEAKER_52]: Right now, maximum by-right heights for most of the corridor is three stories.

228
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:28,723
[SPEAKER_52]: Under this proposal, that's staying much the same everywhere except for in mixed-use two sub-districts.

229
00:21:29,283 --> 00:21:35,807
[SPEAKER_52]: In mixed-use two sub-districts, it's proposed to go up by one story, so you can build to four stories as your buy-right maximum.

230
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:40,190
[SPEAKER_52]: In Haines Square, this proposal would actually lower maximum heights.

231
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:48,214
[SPEAKER_52]: Right now, if you wanted to, which I don't think a lot of residents would want to, you could be building a six-story apartment building or a 15-story hotel.

232
00:21:48,795 --> 00:21:50,876
[SPEAKER_52]: This proposal will bring that down to scale.

233
00:21:52,696 --> 00:21:54,157
[SPEAKER_52]: I next want to quickly touch on commercial.

234
00:21:55,058 --> 00:22:05,544
[SPEAKER_52]: Salem Street, we all know, is characterized by many beloved small businesses from convenience stores to karate dojos to bike shops, and all of them are nonconforming under our current zoning.

235
00:22:06,285 --> 00:22:15,171
[SPEAKER_52]: This proposal allows for ground level commercial buy right to encourage small business development and make it easier to see more of these things and these types of businesses that we already love.

236
00:22:15,191 --> 00:22:18,733
[SPEAKER_52]: I'll quickly touch on incentive zoning.

237
00:22:20,624 --> 00:22:27,671
[SPEAKER_52]: Through incentive zoning under this proposal, it is possible to build above the three-story maximum and the four-story maximum by right.

238
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:40,823
[SPEAKER_52]: Developers could build up to four stories in mixed-use one sub-districts and up to six stories in mixed-use two and commercial sub-districts if they maximally satisfy a certain community benefit conditions.

239
00:22:41,804 --> 00:22:45,868
[SPEAKER_52]: Incentive zoning increases are not allowed in multi-unit residential sub-districts.

240
00:22:46,328 --> 00:22:49,170
[SPEAKER_52]: those areas top out at three stories permanently.

241
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:51,152
[SPEAKER_52]: There's no opportunity for going above three there.

242
00:22:52,533 --> 00:22:56,335
[SPEAKER_52]: I do want to stress that incentive zoning is not a blank check for developers.

243
00:22:57,056 --> 00:23:09,245
[SPEAKER_52]: Any uses that are not by right uses will still go through site plan review and public permitting procedures that involve studies and negotiation of community benefits and impact mitigation agreements on a case-by-case basis.

244
00:23:10,709 --> 00:23:22,197
[SPEAKER_52]: This proposal also includes development context standards, regulations for how upper floors must be built and shaped to ensure that new buildings don't feel out of place nor block light from existing residential homes.

245
00:23:24,344 --> 00:23:31,453
[SPEAKER_52]: The committee, the consultant, and the CDB also paid special consideration to what kind of uses the community did and did not want on Salem Street.

246
00:23:32,154 --> 00:23:43,387
[SPEAKER_52]: And Emily Ennis will speak more about that next, but I'll just quickly mention this zoning proposal does reflect changes to allowed uses based on a lot of community feedback that we heard throughout January and February.

247
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:50,331
[SPEAKER_52]: Under this proposal, the only medical uses in the district will be quote-unquote neighborhood medical, which is a new defined term.

248
00:23:50,992 --> 00:23:54,974
[SPEAKER_52]: They are no more than 1,500 square feet and no more than five employees.

249
00:23:55,734 --> 00:24:00,336
[SPEAKER_52]: Neighborhood medical will be allowed by special permit only in mixed use two and commercial sub-districts.

250
00:24:01,257 --> 00:24:06,880
[SPEAKER_52]: Hotels, which are allowed under our current zoning, would be prohibited under this proposal throughout the entire corridor.

251
00:24:08,521 --> 00:24:15,586
[SPEAKER_52]: And I want to quickly speak to what this proposal does not allow, because there's been a lot of talk about this proposal in this community, and not all of it is accurate.

252
00:24:15,606 --> 00:24:16,988
[SPEAKER_52]: I want us to be armed with the facts.

253
00:24:18,809 --> 00:24:23,172
[SPEAKER_52]: I know that there's been a lot of concern about what zoning in the city will allow for large dorms.

254
00:24:24,493 --> 00:24:28,797
[SPEAKER_52]: This zoning proposal does not create conditions for large dorms on Salem Street.

255
00:24:29,257 --> 00:24:34,101
[SPEAKER_52]: In fact, this proposal recommends no dorms at all, and no sub-district all along the corridor.

256
00:24:35,441 --> 00:24:48,983
[SPEAKER_52]: Neither would it create the conditions for pot shops, all marijuana commercial uses, including retail are prohibited along this corridor boarding houses are allowed only by special permit, they are disallowed in multi unit residential sub districts.

257
00:24:51,083 --> 00:24:53,044
[SPEAKER_52]: I know there's some concern about historic buildings.

258
00:24:53,605 --> 00:24:58,147
[SPEAKER_52]: Buildings over 75 years old are protected by the city's demolition delay ordinance.

259
00:24:59,007 --> 00:25:06,251
[SPEAKER_52]: Buildings can be further protected by the establishment of historic districts, whereby changes can be regulated by the Historic District Commission.

260
00:25:07,011 --> 00:25:10,773
[SPEAKER_52]: This council this term has been supportive of those districting measures.

261
00:25:11,673 --> 00:25:17,859
[SPEAKER_52]: and I'm sure would welcome further collaboration on historic preservation along Salem Street and along other corridors.

262
00:25:18,921 --> 00:25:29,131
[SPEAKER_52]: Broadly speaking, and this applies not only to historic structures, but to structures in general, if any use or structure is rendered nonconforming because of zoning changes, they can continue.

263
00:25:29,952 --> 00:25:35,357
[SPEAKER_52]: There are specific rules that govern nonconforming uses, but right now, Salem Street and much of the city

264
00:25:35,955 --> 00:25:43,182
[SPEAKER_52]: is peppered with nonconforming buildings and lots, which may remain in perpetuity except as outlined under Mass General Law, Chapter 40A.

265
00:25:46,266 --> 00:25:52,809
[SPEAKER_52]: Lastly, I'll quickly speak to a concern that I know a lot of people have around traffic, traffic impact along Salem Street.

266
00:25:53,289 --> 00:25:57,590
[SPEAKER_52]: First, I will note there are no parking changes proposed in this proposal.

267
00:25:59,531 --> 00:26:13,236
[SPEAKER_52]: I know that a lot of folks have been concerned about impact on existing uses and structures through traffic on Salem Street and eager to see the impact on traffic because of changes that might come about through zoning.

268
00:26:13,256 --> 00:26:14,737
[SPEAKER_52]: When we talk about zoning,

269
00:26:15,257 --> 00:26:17,799
[SPEAKER_52]: We're talking about changes that will occur over the long term.

270
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,482
[SPEAKER_52]: Some changes might occur relatively quickly within the next five years.

271
00:26:22,002 --> 00:26:24,344
[SPEAKER_52]: Some changes might not become manifest for decades.

272
00:26:25,245 --> 00:26:35,193
[SPEAKER_52]: That is why in the review process, it is more effective, more beneficial to the community to keep traffic and impact mitigation studies where they currently reside, which is at the point of permitting.

273
00:26:36,153 --> 00:26:49,245
[SPEAKER_52]: A traffic study done today or done this year might be completely outdated, irrelevant, unhelpful to the community when a new proposal is proposed under the current zoning in five years, in 10 years, in 20 years.

274
00:26:49,805 --> 00:27:01,916
[SPEAKER_52]: Those type of impact studies are located at the time of permitting so that the community has the best information it can use when it's doing those negotiation, impact study, and community benefit negotiations with developers.

275
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:05,560
[SPEAKER_52]: I've spoken a lot.

276
00:27:06,481 --> 00:27:07,261
[SPEAKER_52]: I want to pass the mic.

277
00:27:07,321 --> 00:27:12,563
[SPEAKER_52]: I'll ask President Bears to next recognize Emily Innis from Innes Associates, a familiar face to most of us.

278
00:27:12,603 --> 00:27:21,047
[SPEAKER_52]: She is going to walk us through a more detailed, more technical overview of the recommendations to this proposal that have come out of the Community Development Board.

279
00:27:22,788 --> 00:27:28,830
[SPEAKER_52]: I thank my fellow councilors for giving me this time to give an overview of this proposal, and I look forward to our discussion.

280
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:30,851
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you, Vice President Collins.

281
00:27:30,911 --> 00:27:32,852
[SPEAKER_47]: Chair recognizes Emily Innis, Innes Associates.

282
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:39,390
[SPEAKER_84]: Thank you very much, Councilors, people who are in the room and people online.

283
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:41,431
[SPEAKER_84]: Thank you for having me tonight.

284
00:27:41,571 --> 00:27:51,557
[SPEAKER_84]: As requested, I'm going to walk through the changes that happened over the course of the review of this document once City Council sent it to the CD board.

285
00:27:52,917 --> 00:27:56,680
[SPEAKER_84]: As Councilor Collins noted, there were changes from

286
00:27:57,810 --> 00:28:08,279
[SPEAKER_84]: The original staff recommendations to the CD board at their first public hearing, we heard public comments, staff made additional recommendations to the CD board.

287
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:17,667
[SPEAKER_84]: The community development board itself at the last meeting made some changes, and then there were some final technical changes that are recommended for tonight.

288
00:28:17,827 --> 00:28:24,193
[SPEAKER_84]: So I believe that the document that is online has all of these changes, so I'm just going to walk through them.

289
00:28:24,833 --> 00:28:25,613
[SPEAKER_84]: one by one.

290
00:28:25,793 --> 00:28:39,476
[SPEAKER_84]: So starting at the January 22nd Community Development Board, city staff recommended some changes to the development incentive bonuses and section 94-9.x.4.

291
00:28:40,037 --> 00:28:50,359
[SPEAKER_84]: And this was to clarify that the height that controls the incentive is in the table of dimensional standards that are for

292
00:28:51,387 --> 00:28:58,530
[SPEAKER_84]: Developers cannot just simply add development or incentive bonuses on top of each other to reach the height that they want.

293
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:02,212
[SPEAKER_84]: The height is limited in that table of dimensional standards.

294
00:29:03,833 --> 00:29:15,898
[SPEAKER_84]: The next recommendation from city staff on January 22nd was to delete the existing definitions for clinic, hospital, and medical office and replace them with the definitions that you see here.

295
00:29:16,318 --> 00:29:20,580
[SPEAKER_84]: So clinic and hospital now refer to state law for the definitions.

296
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:29,345
[SPEAKER_84]: neighborhood medical office, as Councilor Collins stated, is limited by the area and by the number of employees.

297
00:29:29,385 --> 00:29:33,307
[SPEAKER_84]: You're going to see that there's an additional change coming up on that.

298
00:29:33,887 --> 00:29:41,272
[SPEAKER_84]: And then a standard medical office is one that is not limited by the square footage or by the number of employees.

299
00:29:41,652 --> 00:29:46,655
[SPEAKER_84]: And that becomes important when we do the changes and uses that Councilor Collins alluded to earlier.

300
00:29:48,332 --> 00:30:02,256
[SPEAKER_84]: You can see those changes here is that at the time we were recommending that neighborhood medical office be allowed in the Salem Street Corridor District for MX1, MX2, and commercial, and allowed by special permit in those same districts.

301
00:30:02,336 --> 00:30:07,977
[SPEAKER_84]: Again, this is a subsequent change, or this is a change prior to the community meeting.

302
00:30:08,037 --> 00:30:15,539
[SPEAKER_84]: We have a subsequent change, but we want to show you the history of the changes from when the city council referred this to the CD board.

303
00:30:16,516 --> 00:30:23,418
[SPEAKER_84]: We also added step back requirements based on city staff recommendations and a step back waiver.

304
00:30:23,818 --> 00:30:34,002
[SPEAKER_84]: This was the first attempt to reduce the impact on the smaller scale residential adjacent to Salem Street.

305
00:30:34,402 --> 00:30:38,827
[SPEAKER_84]: Again, you're going to see some changes to this in response to community input.

306
00:30:40,108 --> 00:30:52,901
[SPEAKER_84]: And then staff recommended removing adult-use marijuana, including cultivation, manufacture, processing, retail, and laboratory from the Salem Street District.

307
00:30:55,847 --> 00:31:17,795
[SPEAKER_84]: So when we move to the next Community Development Board, so coming out of January 22nd and into March 5th, after the public meeting added and shall operate only between the hours of 8am and 7pm, so now neighborhood medical office is limited by the square footage, by the number of employees and the hours of operation.

308
00:31:18,389 --> 00:31:21,332
[SPEAKER_84]: standard medical office is not limited by those.

309
00:31:22,133 --> 00:31:24,575
[SPEAKER_84]: You'll see here that this is why this is important.

310
00:31:24,655 --> 00:31:28,139
[SPEAKER_84]: Neighborhood medical office is now prohibited from MX-1.

311
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:34,685
[SPEAKER_84]: Medical office itself is prohibited from all three, MX-1, MX-2, and commercial.

312
00:31:35,265 --> 00:31:41,672
[SPEAKER_84]: And neighborhood medical office is allowed by special permit, which is the most restrictive of the permitting processes.

313
00:31:42,312 --> 00:32:05,890
[SPEAKER_84]: uh in mx2 and commercial so changing the definition placed additional conditions on that neighborhood medical use and then adding it by special permit places additional restrictions on how it is permitted uh in listening to the community there were a number of voices that did not want a medical office use at all on salem street but we did hear from some people

314
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:12,072
[SPEAKER_84]: that being able to easily access medical services was desirable.

315
00:32:12,172 --> 00:32:34,818
[SPEAKER_84]: And so we felt by putting it in MX2 and Commercial, which are at the Felsway end of Salem Street, and removing it from MX1, which is now applied to most of the rest of Salem Street, that would be an acceptable, we hope, compromise between a wide variety of voices that we heard at all of the public meetings, including the public Q&A.

316
00:32:36,782 --> 00:32:52,990
[SPEAKER_84]: Next March 5th Community Development Board, we had recommended that the multi-unit residential sub-district be made closer to what will be the neighborhood residential three district.

317
00:32:53,491 --> 00:32:56,952
[SPEAKER_84]: So that is coming up in our next package of changes.

318
00:32:57,012 --> 00:32:59,834
[SPEAKER_84]: We are looking at residential throughout the city right now.

319
00:33:00,835 --> 00:33:05,098
[SPEAKER_84]: And one of the sub districts is called in our three or neighborhood residential three.

320
00:33:06,039 --> 00:33:21,452
[SPEAKER_84]: We had through city staff, the recommendation was to make the original Mr. Sub district that was proposed for Salem Street to have all of the uses all the dimensional standards match to in our three, you're going to see a change to that as well.

321
00:33:21,812 --> 00:33:26,576
[SPEAKER_84]: But you can see here the types of residential uses that would be allowed.

322
00:33:26,957 --> 00:33:32,922
[SPEAKER_84]: Again, this is a residential-only district, so no commercial was proposed for this district in any of the iterations.

323
00:33:33,482 --> 00:33:37,446
[SPEAKER_84]: And you can see through here what would be allowed.

324
00:33:38,226 --> 00:33:39,468
[SPEAKER_84]: Again, this should all be online.

325
00:33:40,348 --> 00:33:55,232
[SPEAKER_84]: Um, in MX1, MX2, and, uh, commercial districts, uh, we recommended that, uh, as Councilor Collins already suggested, uh, that hotel not be permitted in any of these sub-districts, that brewery or taproom would not be permitted in MX1.

326
00:33:55,512 --> 00:34:07,675
[SPEAKER_84]: Uh, we made some changes to parking areas or garages that were accessory to a principal use, whether they were within 500 feet, um, or on the same, uh, lot as the non-conforming use.

327
00:34:08,975 --> 00:34:10,896
[SPEAKER_84]: and created special permits for those.

328
00:34:11,297 --> 00:34:15,499
[SPEAKER_84]: We removed distillery or winery from MX1 and MX2.

329
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:23,042
[SPEAKER_84]: We removed, we clarified that home occupation was by special permit in MX1 and MX2.

330
00:34:24,603 --> 00:34:30,568
[SPEAKER_84]: And then these are the dimensions, again, being lined up with the Neighborhood Residential 3.

331
00:34:30,948 --> 00:34:34,251
[SPEAKER_84]: Neighborhood Residential 3 allows a maximum of three units.

332
00:34:34,271 --> 00:34:36,733
[SPEAKER_84]: So you can see that here.

333
00:34:37,573 --> 00:34:44,819
[SPEAKER_84]: It does also allow for historic conversion from a single unit up to four units.

334
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:49,282
[SPEAKER_84]: So that was included in the concepts.

335
00:34:50,403 --> 00:34:54,546
[SPEAKER_84]: uh, setbacks, stormwater, and landscaping, again, all consistent with NR3.

336
00:34:55,446 --> 00:35:15,179
[SPEAKER_84]: And then in MX1, MX2, and commercial, there was a step-back requirement for MX1 along Salem Street, um, that had the disadvantage of pushing the upper floors closer to the residential, uh, parcels behind, um, uh, or on the other side of Salem Street.

337
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:19,662
[SPEAKER_84]: So if you have Salem Street, you have the building going in, you have the residential parcels behind,

338
00:35:20,102 --> 00:35:26,187
[SPEAKER_84]: a step back at the upper floor pushes that upper floor towards the residential lots.

339
00:35:26,627 --> 00:35:30,010
[SPEAKER_84]: So we deleted that step back requirement in MX-1.

340
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:33,413
[SPEAKER_84]: MX-1 is also a lower height than MX-2 in commercial.

341
00:35:33,993 --> 00:35:42,340
[SPEAKER_84]: So we don't want somebody going up three stories and then just having to step back that fourth story in MX-1 and again push that building

342
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,461
[SPEAKER_84]: closer to the residential.

343
00:35:44,922 --> 00:35:57,913
[SPEAKER_84]: We also added a minimum rear setback of 10 feet in MX1, MX2 and commercial again to give more of a buffer between the new districts along Salem Street and the existing residential behind.

344
00:36:00,587 --> 00:36:07,549
[SPEAKER_84]: So this here is the multi-unit residential subdistrict coming in at one to three units.

345
00:36:07,589 --> 00:36:12,430
[SPEAKER_84]: So you have to change it in the table and you also have to change it in the definitions here.

346
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:20,592
[SPEAKER_84]: And then we found that the side and rear setback language was confusing to people.

347
00:36:20,692 --> 00:36:21,292
[SPEAKER_84]: It included a

348
00:36:21,992 --> 00:36:31,254
[SPEAKER_84]: a fence that read as though that the fence was implied or what we heard from people was that it implied that the setback was only five feet.

349
00:36:31,295 --> 00:36:48,359
[SPEAKER_84]: We did not want to create that misunderstanding, so we actually removed the fence altogether and require that the applicant provide not just the landscape, not just the setback of 10 feet, but that the buffer actually has to be landscaped as well.

350
00:36:49,046 --> 00:36:52,849
[SPEAKER_84]: Of course, they could have a fence within that, but the fence is not required within that.

351
00:36:52,949 --> 00:36:55,530
[SPEAKER_84]: It doesn't have a separate set of dimensional standards.

352
00:36:56,731 --> 00:37:11,401
[SPEAKER_84]: And then we amended the Salem Street neighborhood corridor map to show that the area around Park Street and Salem, that corner which had been zoned for MX2 is now rezoned to MX1 or proposed to be rezoned to MX1.

353
00:37:12,261 --> 00:37:29,211
[SPEAKER_84]: that has the effect of reducing the height and also including the new restrictions on uses that we just discussed and again changing the MR to allow for the lining that up with the NR3.

354
00:37:29,271 --> 00:37:32,092
[SPEAKER_84]: There are a couple of minor modifications to parcels.

355
00:37:32,453 --> 00:37:35,675
[SPEAKER_84]: All of those are viewable on the map which is on the WIT Cities website.

356
00:37:36,815 --> 00:37:45,760
[SPEAKER_84]: The Community Development Board had some additional recommendations at the March 5th meeting, so they accepted all of those recommendations and then they had some additional ones.

357
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:56,346
[SPEAKER_84]: There was a discussion of whether or not NR3 would be more appropriate for the MR, what we're calling the MR District now, or Urban Residential 1.

358
00:37:56,506 --> 00:37:59,968
[SPEAKER_84]: Urban Residential 1 allows up to six units.

359
00:38:00,808 --> 00:38:11,874
[SPEAKER_84]: Um, uh, during the meeting, we went and looked at, um, some of the map analyses that we did, primarily the analysis of what is on the ground now in terms of residential units.

360
00:38:12,714 --> 00:38:25,061
[SPEAKER_84]: And after some discussion, the CA, Community Development Board has recommended that the MR residential sub-district, instead of following NR3, should follow, uh, UR1, Urban Residential 1.

361
00:38:25,827 --> 00:38:29,248
[SPEAKER_84]: So this pink are the changes that would be allowed.

362
00:38:30,589 --> 00:38:42,133
[SPEAKER_84]: Primarily, it just allows that slightly additional level of density from two to six units, and then some minor changes to some of the other dimensional standards.

363
00:38:42,834 --> 00:38:48,296
[SPEAKER_84]: Again, within the definition of the district that it is now two to six instead of one to three.

364
00:38:49,716 --> 00:38:57,479
[SPEAKER_84]: Uh, we did, uh, in response to community development board requests, uh, also modify the development incentives.

365
00:38:57,519 --> 00:39:02,880
[SPEAKER_84]: They were concerned that some of the incentives were not properly tailored to Salem street.

366
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:05,341
[SPEAKER_84]: And so, and the, the needs of Salem street.

367
00:39:05,821 --> 00:39:11,243
[SPEAKER_84]: So we reduce the, um, uh, amount of, um, additional floor area.

368
00:39:11,797 --> 00:39:14,940
[SPEAKER_84]: that some of the incentives could have.

369
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:21,425
[SPEAKER_84]: So the indoor pedestrian seating or outdoor pedestrian plaza was reduced to a quarter story from a half story.

370
00:39:21,866 --> 00:39:25,469
[SPEAKER_84]: Same thing for the fountain water element, an additional quarter story.

371
00:39:25,509 --> 00:39:34,717
[SPEAKER_84]: They have asked the consultant team to work with city staff to come up with some additional thoughts around incentives

372
00:39:35,197 --> 00:39:50,924
[SPEAKER_84]: but they felt if the CD board members don't mind my summarizing, they were more concerned about affordability levels and environmental and energy efficiency than some of these other elements.

373
00:39:51,325 --> 00:40:03,170
[SPEAKER_84]: And then parking concealed below grade or within a building structure because of the emphasis of walkability and pedestrian friendliness along Salem Street, they wanted to make that a full additional story.

374
00:40:03,543 --> 00:40:07,710
[SPEAKER_84]: to create a bigger incentive for not having open parking along Salem Street.

375
00:40:09,275 --> 00:40:18,097
[SPEAKER_84]: uh, in terms of additional, um, uh, recommendations from, uh, ourselves through city staff to the, uh, city, um, uh, council.

376
00:40:18,657 --> 00:40:30,520
[SPEAKER_84]: Uh, we also recommended, uh, removing dormitory fraternity or sorority house from both MX one and MX two, uh, and research and testing laboratory, um, also townhouse from MX one and MX two.

377
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:38,922
[SPEAKER_84]: Um, and then, uh, under stormwater and landscaping, increasing the ideal score for the green score.

378
00:40:39,743 --> 00:40:40,543
[SPEAKER_84]: in those areas.

379
00:40:41,104 --> 00:40:59,560
[SPEAKER_84]: And then finally, we noted that in the conversations about setbacks, one of the earlier paragraphs about transitioning to the adjacent residential districts because of the changes that we made earlier about how to step back from the rear and the side lot line.

380
00:41:00,981 --> 00:41:04,705
[SPEAKER_84]: This F is no longer relevant.

381
00:41:04,805 --> 00:41:09,950
[SPEAKER_84]: It's been superseded by changes that were made before City Council sent this to the CD board.

382
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:13,894
[SPEAKER_84]: So we just caught that and recommend removing that.

383
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:18,439
[SPEAKER_84]: And that is what I have for the changes to the Salem Street sounding board.

384
00:41:22,735 --> 00:41:23,135
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

385
00:41:24,936 --> 00:41:25,256
[SPEAKER_47]: All right.

386
00:41:25,276 --> 00:41:30,457
[SPEAKER_47]: That's some great information, Vice President Collins and Planner Ennis.

387
00:41:31,938 --> 00:41:36,279
[SPEAKER_47]: With that, I will go to members of the council for comments or questions, please.

388
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:38,380
[SPEAKER_47]: Councilor Leming.

389
00:41:40,622 --> 00:41:54,987
[SPEAKER_41]: I just like to thank my colleagues for doing this as well as the staff consultants who put so much work into this and especially the residents who are pushing for any kind of new zoning to happen in the area for many years.

390
00:41:56,862 --> 00:42:02,506
[SPEAKER_41]: This really does present the culmination of a lot of effort in this area.

391
00:42:02,526 --> 00:42:21,661
[SPEAKER_41]: This is a response to the constant calls that we get about making businesses better in Medford, about welcoming in new businesses, about building up more affordable housing in the city.

392
00:42:21,681 --> 00:42:23,823
[SPEAKER_41]: And I'm just, I'm

393
00:42:25,016 --> 00:42:25,976
[SPEAKER_41]: very proud of my colleagues.

394
00:42:25,996 --> 00:42:29,797
[SPEAKER_41]: I'm very proud of everybody who came together to make this happen.

395
00:42:29,817 --> 00:42:45,160
[SPEAKER_41]: I'm really excited about the overwhelming wave of support that we've seen in our inboxes and in the community, particularly in the in the last week about this.

396
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:52,041
[SPEAKER_41]: This body has been talking about fixing the

397
00:42:52,904 --> 00:43:08,152
[SPEAKER_41]: many issues that Medford has with our budget with with the affordable housing situation for a very long period of time and zoning is probably the most powerful lever that a local council can do to to change that.

398
00:43:08,912 --> 00:43:12,794
[SPEAKER_41]: And this is the first time really in a

399
00:43:14,095 --> 00:43:19,262
[SPEAKER_41]: generation or two that we've seen this body act to make some change happen.

400
00:43:19,442 --> 00:43:27,652
[SPEAKER_41]: I understand that change is not something that everybody is necessarily

401
00:43:28,899 --> 00:43:30,140
[SPEAKER_41]: that everybody necessarily likes.

402
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:41,984
[SPEAKER_41]: It's not always something that everybody can agree upon, but I think that the community does agree that doing nothing has been the answer for a very long period of time, and it simply hasn't worked.

403
00:43:42,724 --> 00:43:51,388
[SPEAKER_41]: So, once again, I'd like to thank everybody for all the years of effort and advocacy put into this, as well as all of the work that was done.

404
00:43:51,448 --> 00:43:51,788
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you.

405
00:43:53,108 --> 00:43:53,868
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you, Councilor Leming.

406
00:43:53,908 --> 00:43:55,189
[SPEAKER_47]: Any further comments by members of the Council?

407
00:43:58,065 --> 00:44:02,648
[SPEAKER_47]: Seeing none, we will open the public hearing on the Salem Street Neighborhood Corridor District.

408
00:44:03,568 --> 00:44:06,450
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm going to go through a little bit of how this is going to work.

409
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:10,732
[SPEAKER_47]: So we are going to talk about the Salem Street Neighborhood Corridor District.

410
00:44:11,692 --> 00:44:14,114
[SPEAKER_47]: Each person speaking will have three minutes to speak.

411
00:44:14,594 --> 00:44:18,356
[SPEAKER_47]: If you're in the room and you'd like to speak, you can make a line behind the podium.

412
00:44:18,676 --> 00:44:22,038
[SPEAKER_47]: If you'd like to bring a chair out, if that is helpful for you, that's absolutely fine.

413
00:44:22,978 --> 00:44:26,019
[SPEAKER_47]: If you'd like to speak on Zoom, please raise your hand.

414
00:44:26,999 --> 00:44:33,041
[SPEAKER_47]: If you are on Zoom and you would like to speak, I please ask you to rename yourself to a first and last name.

415
00:44:33,602 --> 00:44:42,084
[SPEAKER_47]: We have had issues in the past with people whose names were not listed on Zoom not being real people and causing us a little trouble.

416
00:44:42,244 --> 00:44:44,845
[SPEAKER_47]: So if you could please rename yourselves.

417
00:44:45,245 --> 00:44:47,486
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm going to turn that power on right now.

418
00:44:50,435 --> 00:44:51,576
[SPEAKER_47]: if you'd like to speak, but yes.

419
00:44:52,656 --> 00:44:54,077
[SPEAKER_47]: So we'll move to public comment.

420
00:44:54,117 --> 00:44:54,878
[SPEAKER_47]: It'll be three minutes.

421
00:44:55,218 --> 00:44:55,998
[SPEAKER_47]: There'll be a timer.

422
00:44:56,018 --> 00:45:03,222
[SPEAKER_47]: I will give you a 30 second warning and we will hear from everyone once before we hear from anyone again.

423
00:45:03,543 --> 00:45:05,984
[SPEAKER_47]: If you were speaking a second time, you'll be able to speak for one minute.

424
00:45:07,165 --> 00:45:11,887
[SPEAKER_47]: So with that, if you'd like to speak, please make a line at the podium and we'll get started.

425
00:45:14,529 --> 00:45:18,291
[SPEAKER_47]: And this is for people in favor, against, or who have a more complicated position on the issue.

426
00:45:19,855 --> 00:45:23,498
[SPEAKER_47]: I will also note that we received a large number of email comments today.

427
00:45:23,518 --> 00:45:29,183
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm asking the clerk to include those as part of the record, which he will do.

428
00:45:29,863 --> 00:45:33,506
[SPEAKER_47]: Only two of those email comments actually requested that I read those comments.

429
00:45:33,586 --> 00:45:37,510
[SPEAKER_47]: And one of them messaged me that they're here tonight and they'll just be speaking to them.

430
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:43,555
[SPEAKER_47]: So I will read one comment into the record sometime, maybe when we need a break.

431
00:45:44,876 --> 00:45:46,537
[SPEAKER_47]: With that, we'll go to the podium.

432
00:45:47,177 --> 00:45:48,639
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record, please.

433
00:45:49,808 --> 00:45:51,849
[SPEAKER_47]: and you have three minutes.

434
00:45:54,730 --> 00:45:57,572
[SPEAKER_32]: William Navarre, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

435
00:45:58,352 --> 00:46:06,216
[SPEAKER_32]: Mr. President, I rise to support the zoning and I rise in resolute pursuit of a more urban and less car-dependent future.

436
00:46:07,117 --> 00:46:15,421
[SPEAKER_32]: For far too long, the people of our city have been harmed by a housing shortage imposed in part by zoning codes that holds back a city ready to grow.

437
00:46:16,141 --> 00:46:17,642
[SPEAKER_32]: Nobody can find an apartment

438
00:46:18,535 --> 00:46:19,856
[SPEAKER_32]: Medford's ready for new zoning.

439
00:46:19,896 --> 00:46:21,218
[SPEAKER_32]: We are demanding new zoning.

440
00:46:21,678 --> 00:46:26,683
[SPEAKER_32]: We are ready for you to go back and reevaluate the lack of wisdom behind costly parking mandates.

441
00:46:27,203 --> 00:46:32,128
[SPEAKER_32]: We are talking about Salem Street tonight, but it's part of the city wide zoning update.

442
00:46:32,228 --> 00:46:33,429
[SPEAKER_32]: And that's why I support it.

443
00:46:33,469 --> 00:46:37,713
[SPEAKER_32]: I would not support it if the proposal were to concentrate the development on Salem Street.

444
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:39,335
[SPEAKER_32]: That's not what's happening tonight.

445
00:46:39,675 --> 00:46:41,217
[SPEAKER_32]: City wide update.

446
00:46:42,401 --> 00:46:44,142
[SPEAKER_32]: People talk about traffic and parking.

447
00:46:44,403 --> 00:46:50,668
[SPEAKER_32]: When we limit housing in our cities, don't we just push people further out into the suburbs and exurbs while they drive more?

448
00:46:51,609 --> 00:46:55,772
[SPEAKER_32]: Have you not heard a million times, Mr. President, that Bedford is a cut through town?

449
00:46:56,573 --> 00:46:59,895
[SPEAKER_32]: That traffic isn't going anywhere when we ship people out to the sticks.

450
00:47:00,276 --> 00:47:05,800
[SPEAKER_32]: They are still coming through here, through our neighborhoods, causing traffic jams, pollution, et cetera.

451
00:47:07,001 --> 00:47:09,804
[SPEAKER_32]: And the consultants have been listening to the community, Mr. President.

452
00:47:09,884 --> 00:47:11,405
[SPEAKER_32]: I've been involved with this from the beginning.

453
00:47:12,296 --> 00:47:19,820
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't think they needed to reduce the MX2 node at Park Street and Salem Street down to MX1, but they did, and they're listening.

454
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:22,041
[SPEAKER_32]: They're listening to the concerns of the community.

455
00:47:22,741 --> 00:47:24,502
[SPEAKER_32]: What they're proposing, it's not radical.

456
00:47:24,582 --> 00:47:32,947
[SPEAKER_32]: It simply makes it possible for more housing, more shops, and more walkable streets to grow, to go up where people want to live, work, and shop.

457
00:47:33,947 --> 00:47:36,989
[SPEAKER_32]: And I'm joyful at the vision of our future that the planners represent.

458
00:47:37,767 --> 00:47:40,868
[SPEAKER_32]: Wide sidewalks, trees, benches, maybe some outdoor dining.

459
00:47:41,069 --> 00:47:44,170
[SPEAKER_32]: These are the things they mentioned and they give us optimism for the future.

460
00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:52,694
[SPEAKER_32]: But while I'm joyful and optimistic for the future, I must admit how deeply I regret the status quo and how much we deeply need change.

461
00:47:53,534 --> 00:47:57,016
[SPEAKER_32]: Americans are no longer moving toward opportunity in our cities.

462
00:47:57,316 --> 00:47:58,877
[SPEAKER_32]: They're moving away from opportunities.

463
00:47:58,917 --> 00:48:01,538
[SPEAKER_32]: They're moving away from our cities so they can afford housing.

464
00:48:01,858 --> 00:48:06,040
[SPEAKER_32]: That's what we're talking about when we hear about people getting displaced from Bedford.

465
00:48:07,025 --> 00:48:10,187
[SPEAKER_32]: away from opportunity, away from the cities.

466
00:48:10,787 --> 00:48:11,227
[SPEAKER_32]: And for what?

467
00:48:11,527 --> 00:48:13,388
[SPEAKER_32]: For more parking for cars in our cities?

468
00:48:14,489 --> 00:48:15,229
[SPEAKER_32]: Is that the plan?

469
00:48:16,970 --> 00:48:20,892
[SPEAKER_32]: What is to become of our commonwealth or our republic if we don't make a change?

470
00:48:21,967 --> 00:48:27,652
[SPEAKER_32]: The state government estimates we gotta have 222,000 units by 2035 just to stay competitive.

471
00:48:28,032 --> 00:48:28,893
[SPEAKER_32]: Let's do our part.

472
00:48:29,374 --> 00:48:30,655
[SPEAKER_32]: Let's plan for more people.

473
00:48:31,215 --> 00:48:36,280
[SPEAKER_32]: Let's plan for more people and not just more cars because Medford isn't full.

474
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:37,301
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you, Mr. President.

475
00:48:38,061 --> 00:48:38,402
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

476
00:48:43,830 --> 00:48:46,272
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm going to go to Alex on Zoom.

477
00:48:46,572 --> 00:48:49,634
[SPEAKER_47]: Alex, name and address for the record, please.

478
00:48:49,674 --> 00:48:50,595
[SPEAKER_47]: And you'll have three minutes.

479
00:48:50,775 --> 00:48:54,658
[SPEAKER_47]: And then iPad on Zoom, if you could please rename yourself to give us your name.

480
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,021
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

481
00:48:58,061 --> 00:49:00,943
[SPEAKER_85]: I can turn my video on if you, either way.

482
00:49:01,764 --> 00:49:02,044
[SPEAKER_47]: Go ahead.

483
00:49:02,184 --> 00:49:02,484
[SPEAKER_47]: Here you go.

484
00:49:02,504 --> 00:49:03,185
[SPEAKER_47]: You should be able to now.

485
00:49:04,944 --> 00:49:05,164
[SPEAKER_47]: Great.

486
00:49:05,244 --> 00:49:05,565
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

487
00:49:06,466 --> 00:49:06,806
[SPEAKER_85]: Thank you.

488
00:49:07,106 --> 00:49:10,390
[SPEAKER_85]: My name's Alex Lessenhop, 30 Right Ave.

489
00:49:11,251 --> 00:49:11,811
[SPEAKER_85]: My address.

490
00:49:11,992 --> 00:49:18,118
[SPEAKER_85]: I am just writing, speaking today in strong support of the updated zoning on Salem Street and the Salem Street corridor.

491
00:49:18,819 --> 00:49:22,343
[SPEAKER_85]: This zoning overall is strongly needed to allow organic growth.

492
00:49:22,763 --> 00:49:24,405
[SPEAKER_47]: His address is 30 Right Ave in Medford.

493
00:49:24,465 --> 00:49:24,805
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

494
00:49:24,905 --> 00:49:25,406
[SPEAKER_47]: Continue.

495
00:49:25,947 --> 00:49:26,167
[SPEAKER_47]: Thanks.

496
00:49:26,487 --> 00:49:26,888
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

497
00:49:28,491 --> 00:49:35,996
[SPEAKER_85]: This type of zoning overhaul is sorely needed to allow organic growth on Salem Street and help Medford grow and welcome more people to this lovely city.

498
00:49:36,016 --> 00:49:48,065
[SPEAKER_85]: I was also in favor of the previous version of the zoning before the CDB's adjustments, supporting the original density on Park Street, because we need the extra housing and businesses to achieve our goal of a walkable, vibrant community.

499
00:49:49,362 --> 00:49:56,206
[SPEAKER_85]: I also understand we may need to reduce or eliminate parking minimums to make the zoning as good as possible, which I also strongly support.

500
00:49:57,167 --> 00:50:05,993
[SPEAKER_85]: In some, we need more housing, more neighbors, fewer cars to make Medford even more of a vibrant, walkable, welcoming community than we already are.

501
00:50:06,294 --> 00:50:08,535
[SPEAKER_85]: So I urge you to support this zoning and to pass it tonight.

502
00:50:08,575 --> 00:50:09,116
[SPEAKER_85]: Thank you very much.

503
00:50:10,597 --> 00:50:11,057
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

504
00:50:11,077 --> 00:50:13,819
[SPEAKER_47]: Go to the podium, name and address for the record, please.

505
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:14,640
[SPEAKER_47]: And you'll have three minutes.

506
00:50:15,245 --> 00:50:15,745
[SPEAKER_59]: Yes, hi.

507
00:50:15,845 --> 00:50:18,006
[SPEAKER_59]: Marie Izzo, Pilgrim Road, Medford, Mass.

508
00:50:18,726 --> 00:50:21,368
[SPEAKER_59]: It's been said that we have had no growth here in Medford.

509
00:50:21,488 --> 00:50:27,030
[SPEAKER_59]: I believe that this citywide zoning will create new growth and will help small businesses thrive.

510
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:34,753
[SPEAKER_59]: I strongly urge, however, that we do increase our housing stock for affordability that match the income of our community.

511
00:50:34,773 --> 00:50:43,717
[SPEAKER_59]: I want to thank the council for taking into consideration the concerns that came from the neighborhood with the current changes that reflected the final zoning.

512
00:50:44,017 --> 00:50:44,337
[SPEAKER_59]: Thank you.

513
00:50:45,817 --> 00:50:46,257
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

514
00:50:46,277 --> 00:50:50,299
[SPEAKER_47]: Going to go to Miranda on Zoom.

515
00:50:50,339 --> 00:50:52,220
[SPEAKER_47]: Miranda, name and address for the record, please.

516
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:53,701
[SPEAKER_47]: And you have three minutes.

517
00:50:58,403 --> 00:50:59,523
[SPEAKER_83]: Hi, Miranda Briseno.

518
00:50:59,883 --> 00:51:01,504
[SPEAKER_83]: I live at 2 Taylor Street in Medford.

519
00:51:03,025 --> 00:51:04,005
[SPEAKER_83]: Thank you, Mr. President.

520
00:51:04,445 --> 00:51:06,926
[SPEAKER_83]: I've been a renter in Medford for six and a half years.

521
00:51:07,407 --> 00:51:09,928
[SPEAKER_83]: I've loved living in Medford and I love calling it home.

522
00:51:10,688 --> 00:51:12,609
[SPEAKER_83]: The reality for me is that as a renter,

523
00:51:13,127 --> 00:51:23,335
[SPEAKER_83]: I'm currently trying to find a new apartment that meets my changing needs, and I'm finding it extremely difficult to find a suitable place that will allow me to stay here in this place that's welcoming.

524
00:51:24,076 --> 00:51:25,837
[SPEAKER_83]: I'd love to call home for six and a half years.

525
00:51:26,618 --> 00:51:32,583
[SPEAKER_83]: To that end, I am disappointed to see the multi-use residential drop down from three to six units to one to three.

526
00:51:33,403 --> 00:51:42,751
[SPEAKER_83]: If we want Medford to be affordable and for people to stay in Medford, we need to allow more housing to be built and implement other measures to ensure that rental and home prices stay affordable.

527
00:51:43,495 --> 00:51:51,478
[SPEAKER_83]: This includes whether through zoning or another mechanism, removing parking requirements and minimums, supporting transit, pedestrian and cyclist infrastructure.

528
00:51:53,139 --> 00:51:58,260
[SPEAKER_83]: Additionally, I think there's some short-sightedness with limiting only specific business uses.

529
00:51:58,741 --> 00:52:04,903
[SPEAKER_83]: I think it'll limit the city's ability to generate more tax revenue, in particular with relation to dispensaries and hotels.

530
00:52:05,963 --> 00:52:09,725
[SPEAKER_83]: I recognize for the siting of a dispensary, it's limited to what is around.

531
00:52:10,845 --> 00:52:27,092
[SPEAKER_83]: So maybe a dispensary isn't appropriate in Salem Street, but thinking about the city-wide zoning update, dispensaries have unequivocally across the Commonwealth generated immense revenue for the state and for communities that have worked with companies to allow for their existence.

532
00:52:28,673 --> 00:52:29,934
[SPEAKER_83]: And similarly for hotels.

533
00:52:30,914 --> 00:52:38,878
[SPEAKER_83]: I think if we're truly committed to climate resiliency, one of those is creating truly mixed use areas where people can go to the grocery store, eat a meal with friends,

534
00:52:39,523 --> 00:52:48,791
[SPEAKER_83]: go to a park, exist in third person places where they are free to exist as people, or go to their doctor or receive substance abuse disorder treatment.

535
00:52:49,312 --> 00:53:00,401
[SPEAKER_83]: And when we force these uses to be so far away from each other, we are forcing our neighbors to rely on cars, or if they have no access to a car to simply go without access to necessary destinations, which will be detrimental and fatal.

536
00:53:01,162 --> 00:53:04,665
[SPEAKER_83]: I hope to see more opportunities for housing to be built with less parking required.

537
00:53:05,086 --> 00:53:08,028
[SPEAKER_83]: more medical offices and more business to come to Medford in the future.

538
00:53:08,048 --> 00:53:11,409
[SPEAKER_83]: Doning proposals, I'm looking forward to the one for my area.

539
00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:24,596
[SPEAKER_83]: And I hope that, you know, we're also taking into account the Commonwealth's 3A updates that require MBTA communities to update their housing stock.

540
00:53:25,597 --> 00:53:30,820
[SPEAKER_83]: And also just wanna thank all that have worked hard, both, you know, city staff, the council and as associates.

541
00:53:31,788 --> 00:53:36,213
[SPEAKER_83]: This work is not easy, and I thank you for all that you do to balance all the resident input.

542
00:53:36,473 --> 00:53:36,774
[SPEAKER_83]: Thank you.

543
00:53:38,115 --> 00:53:38,616
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

544
00:53:41,239 --> 00:53:46,465
[SPEAKER_47]: Just very quickly on that, on the 3A, we passed the zoning in 2023 on the 3A zoning.

545
00:53:48,247 --> 00:53:48,988
[SPEAKER_47]: Just wanted to note that.

546
00:53:49,448 --> 00:53:52,632
[SPEAKER_47]: Go to the podium, name and address for the record, please, and you'll have three minutes.

547
00:53:53,011 --> 00:53:55,192
[SPEAKER_76]: Carlin Campbell, Hagerty 49, Elmont Street.

548
00:53:55,272 --> 00:54:00,574
[SPEAKER_76]: I'm here to oppose the current zoning for the Salem Street Corridor.

549
00:54:01,394 --> 00:54:19,501
[SPEAKER_76]: I have to admit participating in the Community Development Board meeting last week, I was very pleased that listening to the communities, the community who's gonna be most affected by these changes, making those changes in the proposal to kind of align more with what the neighborhood wanted, what the neighborhood needed.

550
00:54:20,081 --> 00:54:39,263
[SPEAKER_76]: Unfortunately, what happened at that meeting about eight people spoke against it, two of them were only being directly affected and the CB CDB went with their recommendation and said it took everything that the community said we would like to see out when it comes to how heights of buildings, especially

551
00:54:39,884 --> 00:54:51,473
[SPEAKER_76]: changing the MR to urban one, which will be the highest allowed buildings to go, that's going to fall directly into all of our street, my street, where I live with my mother.

552
00:54:52,053 --> 00:54:57,658
[SPEAKER_76]: So with that, I can, on top of all that we all know that Salem Street is a major thoroughfare.

553
00:54:58,198 --> 00:54:59,739
[SPEAKER_76]: Traffic is horrible.

554
00:55:00,179 --> 00:55:01,880
[SPEAKER_76]: It is busy night and day.

555
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:03,821
[SPEAKER_76]: We're putting more density.

556
00:55:04,041 --> 00:55:08,464
[SPEAKER_76]: You want to put more apartments, more buildings, more people, more cars into a location.

557
00:55:08,924 --> 00:55:11,826
[SPEAKER_76]: However, no one has done a traffic study.

558
00:55:12,146 --> 00:55:13,527
[SPEAKER_76]: No one's done a parking study.

559
00:55:13,807 --> 00:55:15,188
[SPEAKER_76]: No one has done a shadow study.

560
00:55:15,588 --> 00:55:19,470
[SPEAKER_76]: All of these were requested in the master plan for zoning, has not been done yet.

561
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:22,111
[SPEAKER_76]: And nobody's looked at the infrastructure, i.e.

562
00:55:22,211 --> 00:55:23,052
[SPEAKER_76]: water, sewage.

563
00:55:23,432 --> 00:55:24,593
[SPEAKER_76]: Can the city

564
00:55:25,213 --> 00:55:30,918
[SPEAKER_76]: with our old infrastructure be able to handle this increase in density.

565
00:55:31,799 --> 00:55:36,042
[SPEAKER_76]: And at the meetings, I've heard that we couldn't do that because it was out of our scope.

566
00:55:36,602 --> 00:55:37,863
[SPEAKER_76]: It costs too much.

567
00:55:38,824 --> 00:55:46,711
[SPEAKER_76]: The zoning proposed can't happen unless you change parking, but you're not changing parking, so what they're proposing in the CDB won't fit there.

568
00:55:47,431 --> 00:55:47,651
[SPEAKER_76]: So

569
00:55:49,177 --> 00:55:55,222
[SPEAKER_76]: I'm just telling everybody here who lives in this neighborhood, what you're proposing is a bait and switch.

570
00:55:55,822 --> 00:55:57,404
[SPEAKER_76]: And I'm really disheartened by it.

571
00:55:58,064 --> 00:55:59,545
[SPEAKER_76]: And I can't support this.

572
00:55:59,645 --> 00:56:04,889
[SPEAKER_76]: And my mother, who's Susan Campbell, also Susan Campbell, couldn't be here tonight.

573
00:56:04,949 --> 00:56:06,010
[SPEAKER_76]: She does not support this.

574
00:56:06,351 --> 00:56:11,555
[SPEAKER_76]: And I know there is a petition with over 900 people in the community, in the neighborhood, against this.

575
00:56:12,155 --> 00:56:15,577
[SPEAKER_76]: Please, I implore you, do not vote for the zoning the way it is.

576
00:56:15,957 --> 00:56:17,018
[SPEAKER_76]: I'm not against zoning.

577
00:56:17,118 --> 00:56:18,198
[SPEAKER_76]: I'm against good zoning.

578
00:56:18,239 --> 00:56:19,699
[SPEAKER_76]: And right now we're not there yet.

579
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:22,121
[SPEAKER_76]: And it's going to be detrimental to our neighborhood.

580
00:56:23,742 --> 00:56:24,162
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

581
00:56:24,182 --> 00:56:30,666
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm going to go to Sneha on Zoom.

582
00:56:31,946 --> 00:56:33,787
[SPEAKER_47]: Sneha, name and address for the record, please.

583
00:56:33,827 --> 00:56:34,868
[SPEAKER_47]: And you'll have three minutes.

584
00:56:42,611 --> 00:56:45,952
[SPEAKER_78]: Hello, I'm Sneha Kound, 108 Medford Street.

585
00:56:47,172 --> 00:56:48,032
[SPEAKER_78]: Good evening, everyone.

586
00:56:48,052 --> 00:56:49,273
[SPEAKER_78]: Good evening, council.

587
00:56:49,753 --> 00:56:52,494
[SPEAKER_78]: I speak in strong support of the proposed rezoning.

588
00:56:52,774 --> 00:57:02,416
[SPEAKER_78]: I'm happy that the city council is responding to the housing crisis we face and urge you to keep up your efforts so Medford can have housing abundance and be a truly welcoming city for all.

589
00:57:02,436 --> 00:57:09,178
[SPEAKER_78]: I also urge you to abolish parking minimums so we are climate resilient and prioritize people over cars.

590
00:57:11,279 --> 00:57:14,401
[SPEAKER_78]: And I thank you all for your excellent service to the community.

591
00:57:14,661 --> 00:57:15,041
[SPEAKER_78]: Thank you.

592
00:57:16,502 --> 00:57:17,023
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

593
00:57:18,564 --> 00:57:20,845
[SPEAKER_47]: Go to the podium, name and address for the record, please.

594
00:57:20,865 --> 00:57:21,806
[SPEAKER_47]: And you'll have three minutes.

595
00:57:22,166 --> 00:57:23,067
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm Ian McGullum.

596
00:57:23,367 --> 00:57:24,688
[SPEAKER_16]: I live at 20 Pleasant Street.

597
00:57:24,828 --> 00:57:29,531
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm close enough to the Salem Street corridor that we walk and bike up there frequently.

598
00:57:29,651 --> 00:57:32,253
[SPEAKER_16]: And also we get lots of cut through traffic on our street.

599
00:57:33,133 --> 00:57:35,715
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm speaking in strong support of the zoning proposal.

600
00:57:38,237 --> 00:57:49,768
[SPEAKER_16]: When we bought our house here in 2018, we were just able to afford the smallest house we could possibly find, and there's no way we'd be able to afford living here if we were buying right now.

601
00:57:50,328 --> 00:57:59,517
[SPEAKER_16]: And I've seen many friends and people we know who have solid jobs in nursing, in carpentry, working in the government, struggle to

602
00:58:01,578 --> 00:58:02,819
[SPEAKER_16]: struggle to afford to live here.

603
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:09,104
[SPEAKER_16]: And obviously the housing crisis is bigger than Medford, but this is our chance to do our part here.

604
00:58:09,585 --> 00:58:18,892
[SPEAKER_16]: And as part of a zoning overhaul through the entire city, I think this is going to be a real step towards housing affordability.

605
00:58:20,185 --> 00:58:30,648
[SPEAKER_16]: And the other thing I wanted to mention was that in Medford, I've seen the most enthusiasm towards new businesses that I've ever seen anywhere I've ever lived.

606
00:58:31,028 --> 00:58:35,449
[SPEAKER_16]: Whenever something opens, people really flock to support it as we saw from Mrs. Murphy's.

607
00:58:36,029 --> 00:58:47,492
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm really hopeful that the rationalization of the commercial zoning, we'll see a vibrant new businesses open up on the Salem Street corridor that I will be able to frequent

608
00:58:48,927 --> 00:58:52,428
[SPEAKER_16]: every week, and I'm just really excited to see that potential.

609
00:58:53,729 --> 00:58:54,209
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

610
00:58:54,229 --> 00:58:58,030
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

611
00:58:58,050 --> 00:58:59,551
[SPEAKER_47]: We'll go back to Zoom.

612
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:01,271
[SPEAKER_47]: We'll go to Zachary Chertok.

613
00:59:01,451 --> 00:59:03,052
[SPEAKER_47]: Zachary, name and address for the record.

614
00:59:03,092 --> 00:59:03,752
[SPEAKER_47]: You have three minutes.

615
00:59:05,528 --> 00:59:11,973
[SPEAKER_86]: Zachary church talk five all month street, literally right at the corner of all month and Salem in the middle of where this is taking place.

616
00:59:13,014 --> 00:59:18,297
[SPEAKER_86]: First I want to express my condolences to the city in particular President Bears on the untimely passing of your friend and colleague.

617
00:59:19,138 --> 00:59:22,641
[SPEAKER_86]: No one should suffer that kind of loss and I sincerely offer my condolences.

618
00:59:24,942 --> 00:59:25,963
[SPEAKER_86]: Shifting to the zoning.

619
00:59:26,603 --> 00:59:39,569
[SPEAKER_86]: I want to preface and clarify that I think my position as we've come through these meetings has been pretty clear that I don't rebut the expectation that there will be new density and that there's a need for increased density coming to Medford, and that it's on our horizon.

620
00:59:39,589 --> 00:59:44,391
[SPEAKER_86]: The problem continues to lie with the process and proposal so far in terms of how it's being managed.

621
00:59:45,832 --> 01:00:00,403
[SPEAKER_86]: The current proposal still continues to have discrepancies regarding a data-backed approach, proffering real concerns about contravention of measurement and public engagement procedures outlined by the American Institute of Certified Planners and with the city's own comprehensive plan.

622
01:00:00,943 --> 01:00:06,767
[SPEAKER_86]: This isn't a new concern as multiple notices and outreach for these concerns have been sent to the appropriate parties throughout the process.

623
01:00:07,688 --> 01:00:16,599
[SPEAKER_86]: Per ethics obligations for reporting report to that has been filed with the to request information and to look into this with the proper parties named.

624
01:00:16,639 --> 01:00:22,425
[SPEAKER_86]: It's an unfortunate measure, but it's 1 that became unaffordable because I'm bound by my own engineering ethics obligations.

625
01:00:23,707 --> 01:00:39,778
[SPEAKER_86]: Cursory review with industry professionals and peers has indicated that the current density draws away from transit quarters and risks going against the tenants of the MBTA Communities Act, even if legally the city's density profile might prove to be satisfactory for the actual conditions of the act.

626
01:00:40,938 --> 01:00:53,231
[SPEAKER_86]: Examining the available materials that are deemed current for the zoning proposals on a neighborhood by neighborhood basis has also continued to make it difficult to examine how the proposal fits into the broader multi-neighborhood efforts across Medford.

627
01:00:53,892 --> 01:01:01,739
[SPEAKER_86]: But the consensus across those same peer professionals that was noted previously in my own public participation in the CD board meetings

628
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:21,279
[SPEAKER_86]: is that density is being drawn away from transit nodes and that lot size reduction, potential future parking reductions following this proposal, noted not included in this proposal here, and no clear plans for transit diversification in the Salem Street area still raises concerns for access, particularly for the economic demography of the area.

629
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:30,266
[SPEAKER_86]: Urban planning and land use regulations are complex in their nature and they have far-reaching design consequences and are not simply a matter of adding housing stock.

630
01:01:31,167 --> 01:01:48,399
[SPEAKER_86]: As a studied field, urban planning rooted in several engineering principles and economics have bedrock considerations that have not been fully examined here to manage the density flow coming in, despite the fact that I respect and appreciate the efforts that have been made on the part of the participating groups.

631
01:01:49,340 --> 01:01:54,561
[SPEAKER_86]: Due diligence still has to be completed for existing conditions, benchmarks into public safety and infrastructure.

632
01:01:54,581 --> 01:01:55,861
[SPEAKER_86]: 30 seconds.

633
01:01:55,981 --> 01:02:01,982
[SPEAKER_86]: And not build out, but existing capacities to guarantee equity and how the current planning density can be accommodated.

634
01:02:02,422 --> 01:02:02,843
[SPEAKER_86]: Thank you.

635
01:02:04,703 --> 01:02:05,183
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

636
01:02:05,203 --> 01:02:13,765
[SPEAKER_47]: We'll go back to the podium.

637
01:02:13,825 --> 01:02:15,025
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record, please.

638
01:02:15,085 --> 01:02:16,065
[SPEAKER_47]: And you'll have three minutes.

639
01:02:17,260 --> 01:02:18,600
[SPEAKER_87]: My name is Mark Davidson.

640
01:02:19,601 --> 01:02:23,522
[SPEAKER_87]: I'm from 63 West Street on the hillside.

641
01:02:25,382 --> 01:02:31,343
[SPEAKER_87]: My daughter and her family live in the Salem Street neighborhood on Farragut Avenue.

642
01:02:31,363 --> 01:02:35,724
[SPEAKER_87]: They have two kids, two of my grandchildren.

643
01:02:38,805 --> 01:02:40,185
[SPEAKER_87]: All of my kids grew up here.

644
01:02:41,006 --> 01:02:42,186
[SPEAKER_87]: Only one lives in Medford,

645
01:02:43,584 --> 01:02:51,030
[SPEAKER_87]: I think the housing shortage keeps maybe one or two of the others from living in Medford affordability.

646
01:02:51,190 --> 01:02:54,833
[SPEAKER_87]: So I'd like to lend my voice in support of this initiative.

647
01:02:55,494 --> 01:03:10,325
[SPEAKER_87]: I think also for the neighborhood itself, having a variety of businesses is walkable businesses in the neighborhood would improve the neighborhood significantly.

648
01:03:12,487 --> 01:03:21,451
[SPEAKER_87]: There's not a possibility of a grocery store on that street because of the current zoning restrictions.

649
01:03:22,711 --> 01:03:30,334
[SPEAKER_87]: And I think of increased affordable housing is an important need for the whole city, not just for that quarter, but for the whole city.

650
01:03:31,835 --> 01:03:46,367
[SPEAKER_87]: we need to welcome younger and more vibrant citizens from not only who had been residents of Medford but from outside just adding new life and vibrancy to the community I think is important.

651
01:03:46,707 --> 01:03:52,372
[SPEAKER_87]: I'd also like to say that I believe that a more walkable business-friendly

652
01:03:55,034 --> 01:04:02,800
[SPEAKER_87]: housing-friendly Salem Street would actually attenuate the traffic, would slow it down, make it more walkable.

653
01:04:03,521 --> 01:04:07,544
[SPEAKER_87]: And I believe that that's something that should be considered as well.

654
01:04:08,104 --> 01:04:15,309
[SPEAKER_87]: A more walkable, business-friendly, neighborhood-friendly neighborhood, I think is what I'd like to see.

655
01:04:15,509 --> 01:04:17,351
[SPEAKER_87]: And I think this initiative addresses that.

656
01:04:17,831 --> 01:04:18,171
[SPEAKER_87]: Thank you.

657
01:04:19,372 --> 01:04:19,773
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

658
01:04:21,671 --> 01:04:22,372
[SPEAKER_47]: We'll go back to zoom.

659
01:04:22,392 --> 01:04:26,918
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm going to go to Caitlin Robinson, Caitlin name and address for the record and you'll have three minutes.

660
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:32,525
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Caitlin Robinson 31 Everett Street.

661
01:04:32,645 --> 01:04:39,414
[SPEAKER_00]: First I want to say thank you to everyone who has been involved in this and to the city council for taking our comments tonight.

662
01:04:41,397 --> 01:04:44,158
[SPEAKER_00]: I am speaking in support of this rezoning proposal.

663
01:04:44,918 --> 01:04:52,579
[SPEAKER_00]: I too was disappointed by the shift down to MR1 instead of MR2 at the Park Street mode.

664
01:04:52,639 --> 01:04:54,620
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish that we had retained density there.

665
01:04:56,280 --> 01:05:02,782
[SPEAKER_00]: I am also disappointed that parking minimums have not been addressed in this process.

666
01:05:02,822 --> 01:05:08,943
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that there might be a later process, but as part of this zoning now, I'm concerned about how those parking minimums

667
01:05:09,384 --> 01:05:13,688
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to negatively impact these attempts at rezoning.

668
01:05:15,349 --> 01:05:29,421
[SPEAKER_00]: We heard that some of the goals of this rezoning are to increase housing units, to have more affordable housing, increased walkability and climate resiliency, and parking minimums actively work against all of those things.

669
01:05:30,062 --> 01:05:34,486
[SPEAKER_00]: Parking minimums work to limit competition for public space.

670
01:05:34,947 --> 01:05:47,690
[SPEAKER_00]: but there are other tools that the city could explore to limit that competition for public space if that's what the priority is, tools that won't work against the other goals that were set forth as part of this zoning.

671
01:05:48,590 --> 01:05:52,591
[SPEAKER_00]: But I am overall strongly in support of the plan.

672
01:05:52,711 --> 01:05:53,111
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

673
01:05:55,292 --> 01:05:55,852
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

674
01:05:56,952 --> 01:05:59,973
[SPEAKER_47]: We'll go to the podium, name and address for the record, and you'll have three minutes.

675
01:06:01,113 --> 01:06:03,154
[SPEAKER_11]: Charles Fenton, 26 Kearney Street,

676
01:06:04,838 --> 01:06:09,421
[SPEAKER_11]: I live two blocks from Main Square, and I bond and brought up in Medford.

677
01:06:10,662 --> 01:06:25,991
[SPEAKER_11]: And I am against the project as it is, because there were no actual studies done on traffic impact, utility impact, and I don't know.

678
01:06:28,362 --> 01:06:46,429
[SPEAKER_11]: Traffic on Salem Street will be a mess because Salem Street is a thoroughfare, a state road, and many, many, I'd say about 50% of the traffic is from going through Malden Revere into Medford to Route 93.

679
01:06:49,090 --> 01:06:56,213
[SPEAKER_11]: We have no transportation mode near Salem Street either, unlike West Medford, the hillside,

680
01:06:59,969 --> 01:07:06,573
[SPEAKER_11]: This part of Medford, especially off of Haines Square is one of the densest areas in Medford.

681
01:07:08,674 --> 01:07:10,516
[SPEAKER_11]: All packed with two families.

682
01:07:15,339 --> 01:07:23,864
[SPEAKER_11]: Other areas of the city are much more open to more packing as what you're trying to do here is pack more people into the area.

683
01:07:24,704 --> 01:07:25,605
[SPEAKER_11]: I understand that.

684
01:07:25,885 --> 01:07:28,567
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate the work that Innis Group did

685
01:07:29,790 --> 01:07:34,515
[SPEAKER_11]: The CD board and you councilors did a great job with all this.

686
01:07:34,535 --> 01:07:46,166
[SPEAKER_11]: This is very complicated, but I am against it and I will be disappointed in the city councilors that vote for this.

687
01:07:47,667 --> 01:07:50,410
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think hundreds of other people will be as well.

688
01:07:51,011 --> 01:07:51,371
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

689
01:07:52,472 --> 01:07:52,792
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

690
01:07:58,702 --> 01:08:10,553
[SPEAKER_47]: I just want to say before we go back to Zoom, we haven't had a chance to hear from you, Mr. Fenton, but I personally want to say I appreciate you do some great posting on Facebook of the history of Medford, photos of Medford, and I, for one, just really appreciate it.

691
01:08:10,593 --> 01:08:10,973
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

692
01:08:10,993 --> 01:08:14,937
[SPEAKER_47]: We'll go back to Zoom.

693
01:08:15,378 --> 01:08:20,062
[SPEAKER_47]: I have, yep, I have Michael von Korf.

694
01:08:20,963 --> 01:08:21,984
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record.

695
01:08:22,004 --> 01:08:22,905
[SPEAKER_47]: Michael, you have three minutes.

696
01:08:25,639 --> 01:08:26,420
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, thank you.

697
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:31,443
[SPEAKER_15]: Michael von Korf, 44 Petra in Medford, just want to support the new zoning.

698
01:08:31,983 --> 01:08:42,649
[SPEAKER_15]: As the rezoning effort continues, I would really love to see more density, less restrictive zoning, a lower emphasis on cars, and that includes reducing parking minimums.

699
01:08:43,630 --> 01:08:49,613
[SPEAKER_15]: Like a lot of folks in this meeting, I live in a home that I could only afford to purchase because I got in before

700
01:08:50,832 --> 01:08:53,635
[SPEAKER_15]: the recent drastic rise in home prices.

701
01:08:53,795 --> 01:09:01,002
[SPEAKER_15]: I really wanna live in a community that my friends and my coworkers can afford to live in and that someday my children can afford to live in.

702
01:09:01,242 --> 01:09:08,309
[SPEAKER_15]: So thanks so much to everyone involved in the rezoning process and thanks for your work to make Medford more affordable and prosperous.

703
01:09:09,690 --> 01:09:10,051
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

704
01:09:14,376 --> 01:09:23,010
[SPEAKER_47]: Before I go back to the podium just if Rebecca and iPad if you could please rename yourselves, so that to a first and last name I'll recognize you once you do that.

705
01:09:23,731 --> 01:09:27,137
[SPEAKER_47]: But we'll go back to the podium, name and address for the record please and you'll have three minutes.

706
01:09:28,466 --> 01:09:34,649
[SPEAKER_77]: Hi, I'm Joan Lemler and I live at 56 Farragut Avenue, which is very close to Salem Street.

707
01:09:35,209 --> 01:09:43,473
[SPEAKER_77]: I'd like to applaud everyone for all the efforts that they have made to recognize the need for affordable housing and rezoning.

708
01:09:44,493 --> 01:09:49,936
[SPEAKER_77]: Unfortunately, I think the product that is before us now is incomplete.

709
01:09:51,277 --> 01:09:56,560
[SPEAKER_77]: And I could echo some of the statements that have been made by Zach that are on record.

710
01:09:57,541 --> 01:10:01,063
[SPEAKER_77]: Also, the previous man who spoke at the podium.

711
01:10:04,036 --> 01:10:16,687
[SPEAKER_77]: What I'm really concerned about is that the appropriate licensed professionals, such as engineers, traffic study, health people, infrastructure people, have not weighed in on this.

712
01:10:17,147 --> 01:10:19,549
[SPEAKER_77]: I don't want to be a licensure snob.

713
01:10:19,950 --> 01:10:22,692
[SPEAKER_77]: However, I think this is a big

714
01:10:23,733 --> 01:10:29,579
[SPEAKER_77]: project, and it's much harder to undo mistakes that get made.

715
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:39,249
[SPEAKER_77]: And I'm very worried that these individuals are either not on the city payrolls or going to be around on a consistent basis.

716
01:10:41,131 --> 01:10:55,663
[SPEAKER_77]: Just to cite one example, the idea that you have to, over time, look at traffic studies and safety studies, that's very true, but everyone knows how congested our particular street is there.

717
01:10:56,003 --> 01:11:07,933
[SPEAKER_77]: As a matter of fact, I walk two miles a day in the area, which is almost on Salem Street, and I can tell you that the pollution level is so great

718
01:11:08,642 --> 01:11:26,065
[SPEAKER_77]: That I avoid walking along Salem Street because the pollution from the traffic on 93 and Salem Street is really severe and I'm from the Bronx density and pollution don't really

719
01:11:26,825 --> 01:11:43,000
[SPEAKER_77]: bother me as a general rule, but I can tell you, it's one of the worst areas I've lived in the country, and I've lived in many areas, and how is the increase of density going to help this particular situation?

720
01:11:43,660 --> 01:11:45,983
[SPEAKER_77]: And if we're looking at some of those incentives

721
01:11:46,563 --> 01:11:54,930
[SPEAKER_77]: of people sitting outdoors and having like a little cafe scene going on, I question whether that would really be viable.

722
01:11:55,410 --> 01:12:07,200
[SPEAKER_77]: So I'm very concerned about the weighing in of the appropriate professionals so that we could get a rezoning that would really address and long-term have a positive impact.

723
01:12:07,220 --> 01:12:12,844
[SPEAKER_77]: So I just register my opposition at this time for the right reasons that I have cited.

724
01:12:12,864 --> 01:12:13,745
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

725
01:12:18,951 --> 01:12:20,194
[SPEAKER_47]: We'll go back to Zoom.

726
01:12:20,554 --> 01:12:23,500
[SPEAKER_47]: Rebecca Davidson, name and address for the record.

727
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:24,943
[SPEAKER_47]: You have three minutes.

728
01:12:27,108 --> 01:12:27,869
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much.

729
01:12:29,048 --> 01:12:34,933
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm a resident of the Salem Street neighborhood and have been raising my family here for the last few years.

730
01:12:35,533 --> 01:12:37,295
[SPEAKER_10]: I grew up in Medford as well.

731
01:12:38,056 --> 01:12:41,038
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm directly affected by this zoning.

732
01:12:42,279 --> 01:12:44,301
[SPEAKER_10]: I also really love this neighborhood.

733
01:12:44,361 --> 01:12:52,087
[SPEAKER_10]: And what I love most about it is my ability to walk to so many great businesses, bakeries, hair salons, restaurants, and others.

734
01:12:52,648 --> 01:12:57,211
[SPEAKER_10]: Walkability is good for your health, for safety, and for the environment.

735
01:12:58,072 --> 01:13:04,257
[SPEAKER_10]: Zoning changes like this are so important in this neighborhood, especially since this is an environmental justice community.

736
01:13:04,817 --> 01:13:18,147
[SPEAKER_10]: For example, having walkable close access to healthy food is really important, and a small grocery store or other healthy food outlet would be a great addition, which wouldn't be allowable without these important zoning changes.

737
01:13:18,967 --> 01:13:22,990
[SPEAKER_10]: When we moved here, I did some research to learn about the history of this incredible neighborhood.

738
01:13:23,891 --> 01:13:30,375
[SPEAKER_10]: In many ways, it was built with public transit in mind, as well as a tram station that used to exist on Washington Street.

739
01:13:30,956 --> 01:13:37,480
[SPEAKER_10]: At that time, there was a diversity of businesses that allowed people not to have to travel far to meet many of their needs.

740
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:41,462
[SPEAKER_10]: Our current zoning doesn't reflect that neighborhood character.

741
01:13:41,743 --> 01:13:47,666
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, most of the businesses that we all appreciate would not have been allowable under current zoning.

742
01:13:48,687 --> 01:13:56,368
[SPEAKER_10]: We also desperately need to address the housing crisis so that future generations and current residents can afford to live here.

743
01:13:56,988 --> 01:14:03,710
[SPEAKER_10]: It's too expensive to buy a home, rent a home, and the only way to address that is to build more housing.

744
01:14:04,690 --> 01:14:17,952
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm also really disappointed that what I heard at the last Community Development Board meeting is that some of our parking minimums are getting in the way of our housing goals, and I'm looking forward to seeing how that can be addressed.

745
01:14:19,462 --> 01:14:25,969
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to say that I realize and share many of the traffic and safety concerns that have been raised in this entire process.

746
01:14:26,569 --> 01:14:31,674
[SPEAKER_10]: The recent pedestrian fatalities have been both tragic and they never should have happened.

747
01:14:32,335 --> 01:14:36,979
[SPEAKER_10]: I also understand that zoning and calming measures are not mutually exclusive.

748
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:40,143
[SPEAKER_10]: We heard that those safety concerns are really important.

749
01:14:41,064 --> 01:14:45,168
[SPEAKER_10]: but we can have a thriving neighborhood and safe streets at the same time.

750
01:14:45,749 --> 01:14:51,895
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm advocating and hope that my neighbors join me in advocating for better crosswalks and safer streets.

751
01:14:52,696 --> 01:14:56,501
[SPEAKER_10]: That's important right now, but it's separate from this zoning proposal.

752
01:14:57,041 --> 01:14:57,722
[SPEAKER_10]: And hopefully that...

753
01:14:58,863 --> 01:14:59,143
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks.

754
01:14:59,343 --> 01:15:04,945
[SPEAKER_10]: That's hopefully something good that comes from this process is more community advocacy in this area.

755
01:15:05,525 --> 01:15:11,586
[SPEAKER_10]: There are current initiatives to address these serious issues, and I'm looking forward to working with my neighbors on that.

756
01:15:12,347 --> 01:15:21,709
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm in support of this zoning proposal, as I think it will improve our neighborhood now and in the future, bring our great businesses into compliance and help with our community goals.

757
01:15:22,309 --> 01:15:22,689
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

758
01:15:22,709 --> 01:15:24,550
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

759
01:15:29,686 --> 01:15:30,870
[SPEAKER_47]: We'll go back to the podium.

760
01:15:31,191 --> 01:15:32,235
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record.

761
01:15:32,295 --> 01:15:32,998
[SPEAKER_47]: You'll have three minutes.

762
01:15:34,310 --> 01:15:37,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening, Claudia Fennelly, 36 Farragut Ave.

763
01:15:37,793 --> 01:15:41,215
[SPEAKER_02]: I am a homeowner and a resident very close to Salem Street.

764
01:15:41,255 --> 01:16:02,652
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do oppose this rezoning because while change is inevitable, proper change done with feasibility studies, including the city, fire department, police department, safety, water pressure concerns, et cetera, hasn't been included in this before approval of the vote tonight.

765
01:16:03,593 --> 01:16:12,664
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'm concerned is that I've heard stories that, and maybe you could correct me, is it true that West Medford and South Medford have had feasibility studies done already?

766
01:16:13,285 --> 01:16:20,233
[SPEAKER_02]: And if that's true, then why a highly congested area like Salem Street wouldn't have those feasibility studies in place?

767
01:16:20,634 --> 01:16:21,915
[SPEAKER_02]: But with that said,

768
01:16:24,745 --> 01:16:29,210
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a very unique neighborhood, it does need change, it does need upgrade.

769
01:16:29,711 --> 01:16:39,362
[SPEAKER_02]: When Innes Associates came up with the reduced three-story height, I was more favorable to it, and there was more of an inclination to include parking.

770
01:16:39,982 --> 01:16:56,720
[SPEAKER_02]: My concerns stem from the fact that you the city council and the mayor have no problem delegating the feasibility studies to be conducted at the discretion and at the profit interests of the city building contractor and that to me does not represent people.

771
01:16:57,240 --> 01:17:02,346
[SPEAKER_02]: They are not the elected by the people and that is why we look forward

772
01:17:02,826 --> 01:17:12,496
[SPEAKER_02]: We're here tonight because you are the legislative branch that would assist the voters in this area with these concerns of feasibility.

773
01:17:12,917 --> 01:17:23,007
[SPEAKER_02]: And the fact that it hasn't been done is why I cannot vote for this proposed rezoning, even though I think the area desperately needs to be upgraded.

774
01:17:23,628 --> 01:17:47,016
[SPEAKER_02]: I just feel that the study was, you have a good company that you could be working with, but there's a lot of pressure that in demanding what the certain people, some of which don't even live in the area, want to see in that area that there's constant adjustment to that when really feasibility studies should be dictating how we proceed in rezoning the area.

775
01:17:47,836 --> 01:17:53,629
[SPEAKER_02]: not people from other communities or even cities or towns.

776
01:17:54,711 --> 01:17:55,694
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's it.

777
01:17:55,774 --> 01:17:56,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

778
01:17:56,927 --> 01:17:57,307
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

779
01:17:57,407 --> 01:18:10,752
[SPEAKER_47]: And just to your point, I'm not aware of, certainly not as part of this process studies of the kind that you're, exactly what you're talking about have not been done for South Medford or West Medford that have not been done for Salem Street.

780
01:18:11,173 --> 01:18:12,253
[SPEAKER_47]: That has not happened.

781
01:18:12,653 --> 01:18:17,495
[SPEAKER_47]: There have been studies that have been done throughout this process through the comprehensive plan process by the consultant.

782
01:18:18,035 --> 01:18:22,297
[SPEAKER_47]: And I think the general consensus and what Councilor Collins said is

783
01:18:22,897 --> 01:18:30,961
[SPEAKER_47]: we could say, if everything that could possibly be built under this zoning were to exist, what would the conditions look like?

784
01:18:31,401 --> 01:18:35,924
[SPEAKER_47]: But that would not be an accurate representation of what's actually going to happen.

785
01:18:35,944 --> 01:18:39,346
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm sorry, that's the buzzer, because you had a little extra time left.

786
01:18:40,886 --> 01:18:46,349
[SPEAKER_47]: And when we talk about the studies that happen when specific projects are put forward,

787
01:18:48,030 --> 01:19:07,383
[SPEAKER_47]: Those are done, yes, the person who pays for them is the person the proponent of the project, but they are reviewed by the city staff and the city's boards and commissions that review those applications so there is a public element of that process as well city experts and the city's boards and commissions.

788
01:19:07,763 --> 01:19:20,477
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically you are reaffirming that the city will take in a vested interest in the density of traffic in Salem Street and how these building developers carry out these programs.

789
01:19:20,497 --> 01:19:22,940
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes, but it will happen on a project by project basis.

790
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:27,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Project by project and how will the city and how will the residents be notified?

791
01:19:27,847 --> 01:19:49,507
[SPEAKER_47]: On all of the notifications, a site plan review process or a special permit, there are state laws that govern that, direct abutters are notified, but also all of those projects appear on, it's direct abutters and abutters within a certain radius, but also all of those projects appear on a public agenda, either of the Zoning Board of Appeals or the Community Development Board, and very occasionally of this body.

792
01:19:50,762 --> 01:19:53,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much for answering the concerns.

793
01:19:53,404 --> 01:19:57,806
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I still like to see certain things in place before proceeding.

794
01:19:58,286 --> 01:19:58,646
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

795
01:19:58,847 --> 01:19:59,747
[SPEAKER_47]: Appreciate your comment.

796
01:20:03,769 --> 01:20:06,071
[SPEAKER_47]: I'll go to Benjamin on Zoom.

797
01:20:06,111 --> 01:20:09,953
[SPEAKER_47]: Benjamin, name and address for the record and iPad, if you could please rename yourself.

798
01:20:12,733 --> 01:20:13,074
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

799
01:20:13,154 --> 01:20:16,817
[SPEAKER_23]: Benjamin Strime, 76 Marion Street, Medford.

800
01:20:17,197 --> 01:20:27,647
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm speaking in full support of the proposed updates to the city zoning and welcome updates across Medford to allow for taller residential buildings with more units.

801
01:20:28,768 --> 01:20:34,553
[SPEAKER_23]: This will help create more affordable housing and more housing in general, which is very much needed here and across the state.

802
01:20:35,807 --> 01:20:45,972
[SPEAKER_23]: And it will allow more people to live closer to public transit options and be able to live their lives without relying on cars, which is a small but important step that we can take here in Bedford to fight climate change.

803
01:20:47,180 --> 01:20:55,145
[SPEAKER_23]: Um, so I'm in favor of this particular change of zoning, and I'm also in favor of like general changes in zoning across the city to allow for more density.

804
01:20:55,826 --> 01:21:02,790
[SPEAKER_23]: And I'm also, I was surprised and disappointed to see that there was a change to that zoning around Park Street because of parking minimums.

805
01:21:03,431 --> 01:21:08,574
[SPEAKER_23]: I strongly think that we should first think about housing and then think about parking.

806
01:21:09,155 --> 01:21:11,716
[SPEAKER_23]: So thank you to the councillors and everyone involved in this effort.

807
01:21:11,736 --> 01:21:13,778
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

808
01:21:17,581 --> 01:21:19,763
[SPEAKER_47]: We'll go back to the podium, name and address for the record.

809
01:21:19,823 --> 01:21:21,584
[SPEAKER_47]: You have three minutes.

810
01:21:23,726 --> 01:21:25,707
[SPEAKER_47]: Oh, sorry, Ken, go ahead.

811
01:21:25,747 --> 01:21:27,329
[SPEAKER_17]: Ken Garrow, 52 Lambert Street.

812
01:21:28,529 --> 01:21:31,632
[SPEAKER_17]: I am more or less a resident of Salem Street.

813
01:21:31,652 --> 01:21:35,034
[SPEAKER_17]: I live mostly a stone's throw away.

814
01:21:35,195 --> 01:21:38,137
[SPEAKER_17]: I can see Salem Street from my window in my living room.

815
01:21:39,363 --> 01:21:41,304
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm speaking in full support of this.

816
01:21:42,004 --> 01:21:45,925
[SPEAKER_17]: I have been very excited since this came in front of the council in December.

817
01:21:46,825 --> 01:21:48,046
[SPEAKER_17]: I've been tracking it since.

818
01:21:48,946 --> 01:21:54,847
[SPEAKER_17]: I think Planner Innes has done a fantastic job listening to community feedback.

819
01:21:56,028 --> 01:21:59,189
[SPEAKER_17]: I do fully support the neighborhood chats.

820
01:21:59,269 --> 01:22:04,110
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that was an absolutely correct move for communication to the city.

821
01:22:05,030 --> 01:22:05,610
[SPEAKER_17]: and its residents.

822
01:22:07,151 --> 01:22:13,992
[SPEAKER_17]: I also think that as I said, I mean, Vice President Collins can absolutely attest.

823
01:22:14,392 --> 01:22:26,495
[SPEAKER_17]: I know that we in Salem Street have a little bit of tight quarters and I was kind of one of the louder voices I think she probably had to deal with to bring up that point because right now it is true.

824
01:22:26,575 --> 01:22:28,115
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't have the greatest public transit.

825
01:22:28,675 --> 01:22:31,656
[SPEAKER_17]: When the MBTA redesign happens, we're gonna have a much

826
01:22:32,356 --> 01:22:37,899
[SPEAKER_17]: more robust option, taking that 96 bus that'll connect the orange line, the green line, and the red line.

827
01:22:38,019 --> 01:22:39,980
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm perfectly excited for that, honestly.

828
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:44,002
[SPEAKER_17]: I look forward to hopefully being able to commute to work on the bus.

829
01:22:46,223 --> 01:22:49,744
[SPEAKER_17]: And I have been in Medford since 2010.

830
01:22:50,245 --> 01:22:53,126
[SPEAKER_17]: I started looking to purchase a place in 2018.

831
01:22:54,127 --> 01:23:00,450
[SPEAKER_17]: I found my condo in 2019 and was exceptionally fortunate because by the time I

832
01:23:01,962 --> 01:23:09,810
[SPEAKER_17]: had decided to start looking, I had almost certainly just realized I was not going to be living in Medford, a place that I had considered my home for almost a decade.

833
01:23:09,830 --> 01:23:14,415
[SPEAKER_17]: And I absolutely lucked out.

834
01:23:14,435 --> 01:23:15,576
[SPEAKER_17]: I love the concept of

835
01:23:16,897 --> 01:23:22,260
[SPEAKER_17]: more housing being available for people who are okay with smaller, tighter quarters.

836
01:23:23,321 --> 01:23:28,743
[SPEAKER_17]: Personally, I live in one of those 3,000 square foot, three-story multifamily units.

837
01:23:30,084 --> 01:23:32,305
[SPEAKER_17]: It is absolutely fantastic for me in my life.

838
01:23:34,566 --> 01:23:44,271
[SPEAKER_17]: And as Councilor Leming had said earlier, the fact that this also streamlines businesses in such a way that they'll be easier and I can walk to a bunch of things.

839
01:23:44,851 --> 01:23:45,532
[SPEAKER_17]: I walked here tonight,

840
01:23:46,667 --> 01:23:55,215
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not impossible, but it would certainly be nicer if we had wider sidewalks, greener sidewalks, and availability in that way.

841
01:23:56,196 --> 01:23:56,536
[SPEAKER_12]: 30 seconds.

842
01:23:57,177 --> 01:23:59,118
[SPEAKER_17]: I, again, just fully support it.

843
01:23:59,278 --> 01:24:01,460
[SPEAKER_17]: I think this has actually done a fantastic job.

844
01:24:01,540 --> 01:24:07,786
[SPEAKER_17]: I've had concerns where I have voiced them and have been listened to, and I am in full support for this.

845
01:24:09,267 --> 01:24:09,588
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

846
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,382
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm going to go back to Zoom.

847
01:24:18,002 --> 01:24:21,286
[SPEAKER_47]: Go to Jared Nussbaum, name and address for the record, please.

848
01:24:22,347 --> 01:24:24,089
[SPEAKER_47]: And you'll have three minutes.

849
01:24:25,571 --> 01:24:35,101
[SPEAKER_44]: I'm Jared Nussbaum, 76 Jerome Street, and I'm speaking in full support of this zoning change as a renter in Medford.

850
01:24:36,979 --> 01:24:39,940
[SPEAKER_44]: Housing prices are crazy and renting prices are crazy.

851
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:50,284
[SPEAKER_44]: So Medford needs to go forward with these incremental zoning changes throughout Medford, including the Salem Street change.

852
01:24:50,964 --> 01:24:53,966
[SPEAKER_44]: And I also think that parking shouldn't be getting in the way of housing.

853
01:24:53,986 --> 01:25:03,369
[SPEAKER_44]: So we should definitely look at getting rid of or reducing parking minimums or getting rid of them altogether.

854
01:25:04,269 --> 01:25:04,850
[SPEAKER_44]: That's all I got.

855
01:25:09,028 --> 01:25:09,588
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

856
01:25:12,449 --> 01:25:16,350
[SPEAKER_47]: iPad, once again, if you'd like to speak, email me your name, change your name.

857
01:25:17,090 --> 01:25:19,771
[SPEAKER_47]: Otherwise, I'm not gonna recognize you, but we're gonna go to the podium.

858
01:25:20,732 --> 01:25:22,012
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record, please.

859
01:25:22,032 --> 01:25:22,752
[SPEAKER_47]: You have three minutes.

860
01:25:24,213 --> 01:25:25,573
[SPEAKER_31]: Hi, Jim Sampson.

861
01:25:26,413 --> 01:25:28,894
[SPEAKER_31]: I live at 14 Revere Place.

862
01:25:29,814 --> 01:25:35,176
[SPEAKER_31]: Some of you people I'm sure know that Revere Place is a dead end off of Salem Street.

863
01:25:36,242 --> 01:25:42,087
[SPEAKER_31]: And I should mention that I have lived and worked in Medford all my life.

864
01:25:42,968 --> 01:25:51,516
[SPEAKER_31]: And now in the twilight of my life, I don't want to be fighting traffic to get off of my street.

865
01:25:52,657 --> 01:25:53,938
[SPEAKER_31]: I love Medford.

866
01:25:54,138 --> 01:25:57,941
[SPEAKER_31]: Medford is the city I just love.

867
01:25:59,002 --> 01:26:01,765
[SPEAKER_31]: I wouldn't live nowhere else in this world.

868
01:26:02,698 --> 01:26:03,998
[SPEAKER_31]: I love Medford.

869
01:26:04,618 --> 01:26:11,020
[SPEAKER_31]: I do agree Medford needs some change, but I do not think that this is it.

870
01:26:11,340 --> 01:26:21,062
[SPEAKER_31]: And I am opposed to them changing even the texture, the body of Medford and Salem Street is a big part of that.

871
01:26:21,402 --> 01:26:22,302
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you very much.

872
01:26:23,703 --> 01:26:24,103
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

873
01:26:28,860 --> 01:26:30,966
[SPEAKER_47]: We're going to go to William Clark on Zoom.

874
01:26:31,007 --> 01:26:32,591
[SPEAKER_47]: William, name and address for the record, please.

875
01:26:32,611 --> 01:26:33,374
[SPEAKER_47]: You have three minutes.

876
01:26:38,131 --> 01:26:40,713
[SPEAKER_39]: William Clark and 59 Warner Street.

877
01:26:41,513 --> 01:26:44,675
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm speaking here today in favor of the rezoning on Salem Street.

878
01:26:44,695 --> 01:26:50,098
[SPEAKER_39]: In Massachusetts, we have a housing crisis that is hurting all of us and driving cost of living up.

879
01:26:50,639 --> 01:26:55,442
[SPEAKER_39]: Housing costs were the driving force of inflation in 2024, and it's going to continue to get worse.

880
01:26:55,842 --> 01:27:01,866
[SPEAKER_39]: We need to build 220,000 units statewide to just remain competitive nationwide.

881
01:27:02,788 --> 01:27:07,570
[SPEAKER_39]: Medford cannot exist in a bubble, and we have to act and do our part in fixing the housing shortage.

882
01:27:07,911 --> 01:27:12,993
[SPEAKER_39]: Our neighbors in Cambridge are already doing these reforms and legalized six stories by right.

883
01:27:14,674 --> 01:27:17,575
[SPEAKER_39]: Medford needs to do our part and help build more housing.

884
01:27:18,296 --> 01:27:18,636
[SPEAKER_39]: That's all.

885
01:27:20,397 --> 01:27:20,857
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

886
01:27:23,458 --> 01:27:24,279
[SPEAKER_47]: We'll go to the podium.

887
01:27:24,319 --> 01:27:25,459
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record, please.

888
01:27:25,499 --> 01:27:26,380
[SPEAKER_47]: And you have three minutes.

889
01:27:29,023 --> 01:27:31,925
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi, I'm Courtney Botello, 49 Edward Street.

890
01:27:33,026 --> 01:27:35,727
[SPEAKER_19]: I've really enjoyed living in Medford for the past two years.

891
01:27:35,927 --> 01:27:39,430
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not quite sure whether I'll be able to afford doing that in the fall.

892
01:27:39,990 --> 01:27:45,494
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm really in support of any zoning changes, any updates that'll help provide more housing.

893
01:27:45,514 --> 01:27:54,139
[SPEAKER_19]: I also would like you to consider for incentive programs, additional stormwater infrastructure or stormwater

894
01:27:55,544 --> 01:28:00,008
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know, retention-based, anything that developers can do to increase storage on sites.

895
01:28:00,248 --> 01:28:03,150
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that goes hand in hand with zoning and development.

896
01:28:04,611 --> 01:28:05,072
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

897
01:28:05,092 --> 01:28:11,077
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm going to go to Rebecca on Zoom.

898
01:28:11,537 --> 01:28:15,740
[SPEAKER_47]: Rebecca, name and address for the record, and you'll have three minutes.

899
01:28:24,728 --> 01:28:25,088
[SPEAKER_47]: You're on.

900
01:28:29,081 --> 01:28:31,342
[SPEAKER_47]: Rebecca, we can't hear you, but you are unmuted.

901
01:28:31,482 --> 01:28:32,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, sorry, I'm here.

902
01:28:32,863 --> 01:28:35,083
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, I'm Rebecca Lee.

903
01:28:35,123 --> 01:28:40,066
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a resident of Grove Street in Medford, and I'm speaking in support of the zoning.

904
01:28:40,686 --> 01:28:53,551
[SPEAKER_04]: And I really hope that we continue to focus on increasing housing and decrease our focus on parking availability to increase the amount of housing we have in the city.

905
01:28:53,651 --> 01:28:53,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

906
01:28:55,292 --> 01:28:55,632
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

907
01:28:58,812 --> 01:29:01,133
[SPEAKER_47]: Go to the podium, name and address for the record, please.

908
01:29:01,153 --> 01:29:01,793
[SPEAKER_47]: You have three minutes.

909
01:29:02,753 --> 01:29:03,113
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.

910
01:29:03,653 --> 01:29:04,553
[SPEAKER_36]: My name is Gil Gabay.

911
01:29:04,573 --> 01:29:06,974
[SPEAKER_36]: I'm at 48 Almond Street, Medford.

912
01:29:07,754 --> 01:29:13,895
[SPEAKER_36]: I'm a new resident and I'm just taking part in understanding and learning about this process and this project.

913
01:29:13,935 --> 01:29:19,537
[SPEAKER_36]: And I thank the council for undertaking all of these big policy improvements.

914
01:29:19,737 --> 01:29:22,858
[SPEAKER_36]: I am speaking in support of the rezoning project.

915
01:29:23,758 --> 01:29:24,638
[SPEAKER_36]: I hope the project

916
01:29:25,298 --> 01:29:31,485
[SPEAKER_36]: will continue to prioritize walkability, climate resiliency, bikeability, and small businesses.

917
01:29:32,125 --> 01:29:45,119
[SPEAKER_36]: I second what a few other commentators have already stated, and that is to ensure that parking minimums do not undo the core functions of the rezoning project.

918
01:29:45,859 --> 01:29:46,180
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.

919
01:29:47,621 --> 01:29:47,981
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.

920
01:29:52,335 --> 01:29:53,176
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm going to go to Zoom.

921
01:29:53,236 --> 01:29:55,238
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm going to go to Cynthia Estramera.

922
01:29:55,338 --> 01:29:57,380
[SPEAKER_47]: Cynthia, name and address for the record, please.

923
01:29:57,440 --> 01:29:58,541
[SPEAKER_47]: And you'll have three minutes.

924
01:30:02,125 --> 01:30:02,625
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi there.

925
01:30:02,725 --> 01:30:04,547
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Cynthia Estramera.

926
01:30:04,847 --> 01:30:09,132
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a resident at 18 Webster Street.

927
01:30:09,952 --> 01:30:12,715
[SPEAKER_06]: I am speaking in support of the zoning.

928
01:30:12,735 --> 01:30:16,219
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm very thankful for all of the hard work that went into this.

929
01:30:17,765 --> 01:30:32,131
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to speak to a community that's going to modernize itself, that's going to prioritize creating more housing for the home crisis, walkability and bikeability.

930
01:30:32,151 --> 01:30:38,594
[SPEAKER_06]: I want a thriving community where I can go to cafes, restaurants, shops.

931
01:30:39,916 --> 01:31:00,052
[SPEAKER_06]: I want a city that can prioritize pedestrian safety by creating dense neighborhoods where there is going to be, and research shows, a slowdown because people are more interested in looking around, seeing what's available, and stopping in.

932
01:31:02,005 --> 01:31:15,450
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to increase attractability to Medford as we modernize and move forward and change and hopefully bring our home values up while addressing many of the housing shortages.

933
01:31:16,230 --> 01:31:27,975
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, I'm speaking in favor of the zoning that's happening and I'm really proud of all the support and people listening to comments for this.

934
01:31:28,295 --> 01:31:28,715
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

935
01:31:28,735 --> 01:31:30,956
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you very much.

936
01:31:34,362 --> 01:31:35,542
[SPEAKER_47]: going to go to the podium.

937
01:31:35,942 --> 01:31:37,042
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record, please.

938
01:31:37,062 --> 01:31:37,783
[SPEAKER_47]: You have three minutes.

939
01:31:39,423 --> 01:31:41,943
[SPEAKER_13]: Ralph Klein, 172 Park Street in Medford.

940
01:31:42,563 --> 01:31:46,004
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm totally opposed to this, A, calling the Salem Street corridor.

941
01:31:46,024 --> 01:31:47,764
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a Salem Street neighborhood.

942
01:31:48,625 --> 01:31:49,865
[SPEAKER_13]: We have neighbors there.

943
01:31:51,165 --> 01:31:51,945
[SPEAKER_13]: We all live there.

944
01:31:52,705 --> 01:31:53,585
[SPEAKER_13]: We cross the street.

945
01:31:53,665 --> 01:31:56,006
[SPEAKER_13]: Crossing Salem Street, you take your life in your hands.

946
01:31:57,306 --> 01:32:01,407
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, Salem Street has not been surveyed since the 1920s.

947
01:32:03,278 --> 01:32:08,159
[SPEAKER_13]: I found this out when they put in the East Cambridge Savings Bank behind my home.

948
01:32:08,919 --> 01:32:14,061
[SPEAKER_13]: They said they owned five feet in the back portion of my property that I was an abutter.

949
01:32:14,301 --> 01:32:16,801
[SPEAKER_13]: Although it's not listed on the deed, they say they are.

950
01:32:17,001 --> 01:32:18,262
[SPEAKER_13]: The city of Medford surveyed it.

951
01:32:18,982 --> 01:32:22,583
[SPEAKER_13]: So what's gonna happen all the way down the lake to Salem Street?

952
01:32:23,283 --> 01:32:24,723
[SPEAKER_13]: Is everybody gonna lose property?

953
01:32:26,104 --> 01:32:26,784
[SPEAKER_13]: Are they gonna take it?

954
01:32:26,804 --> 01:32:28,884
[SPEAKER_13]: They said it was a scrivener's error is what they quoted.

955
01:32:30,465 --> 01:32:32,025
[SPEAKER_13]: So you need to start looking at

956
01:32:32,765 --> 01:32:38,490
[SPEAKER_13]: what is actually owned on Salem Street, how big Salem Street is, for all the residents.

957
01:32:39,090 --> 01:32:39,791
[SPEAKER_13]: People live there.

958
01:32:39,831 --> 01:32:40,692
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not a corridor.

959
01:32:40,732 --> 01:32:41,452
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a neighborhood.

960
01:32:42,133 --> 01:32:44,375
[SPEAKER_13]: I know Jimmy, who just testified here.

961
01:32:45,356 --> 01:32:46,817
[SPEAKER_13]: I know half the people who came up here.

962
01:32:47,297 --> 01:32:51,861
[SPEAKER_13]: And what I don't like is people from the other side of Medford saying, oh, this is good for your neighborhood.

963
01:32:52,722 --> 01:32:55,745
[SPEAKER_13]: The reason why they're saying that is because they don't live there.

964
01:32:55,845 --> 01:32:57,226
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not going to affect them.

965
01:32:57,686 --> 01:32:58,367
[SPEAKER_13]: It affects us.

966
01:32:59,708 --> 01:33:05,492
[SPEAKER_13]: as being an abutment to Salem Street, even though I'm the fifth house down on Park Street, I'm an abutment to Salem Street?

967
01:33:06,813 --> 01:33:07,614
[SPEAKER_13]: How does that happen?

968
01:33:09,175 --> 01:33:10,276
[SPEAKER_13]: What are you people looking at?

969
01:33:11,476 --> 01:33:14,078
[SPEAKER_13]: The whole traffic corridor on Salem Street is horrible.

970
01:33:15,299 --> 01:33:21,404
[SPEAKER_13]: The other thing is, Salem Street is an east-west district, runs from the east to the west, the solar.

971
01:33:21,924 --> 01:33:25,607
[SPEAKER_13]: If you put up these buildings, you're depriving the neighbor of solar for 60,

972
01:33:26,963 --> 01:33:28,945
[SPEAKER_13]: maybe even 70% of their day.

973
01:33:29,385 --> 01:33:33,248
[SPEAKER_13]: They can't have solar put in because it's not feasible, not cost effective.

974
01:33:34,029 --> 01:33:34,909
[SPEAKER_13]: Have you looked into that?

975
01:33:35,210 --> 01:33:35,430
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

976
01:33:36,050 --> 01:33:37,992
[SPEAKER_13]: Have you looked into the traffic on Salem Street?

977
01:33:38,292 --> 01:33:38,532
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

978
01:33:39,313 --> 01:33:40,274
[SPEAKER_13]: What have you looked into?

979
01:33:41,195 --> 01:33:42,175
[SPEAKER_13]: How to put up buildings.

980
01:33:42,536 --> 01:33:49,641
[SPEAKER_13]: The Nelson Group owns two sides of Salem Street, between Park Street, Revere Place, and Park and Court.

981
01:33:50,762 --> 01:33:51,623
[SPEAKER_13]: What are they going to put up?

982
01:33:52,446 --> 01:33:57,687
[SPEAKER_13]: The other thing I want to say is, don't just look at the aesthetics from Salem Street for the parking, look at the side streets.

983
01:33:58,287 --> 01:34:00,768
[SPEAKER_13]: I have JRA Cycles parking down Park Street.

984
01:34:01,328 --> 01:34:04,989
[SPEAKER_13]: I have the people from the Parter building parking their cars all down Park Street.

985
01:34:05,289 --> 01:34:06,870
[SPEAKER_13]: The people who live there can't park there.

986
01:34:07,450 --> 01:34:07,730
[SPEAKER_13]: Why?

987
01:34:08,230 --> 01:34:09,030
[SPEAKER_13]: There's no parking.

988
01:34:09,050 --> 01:34:11,651
[SPEAKER_13]: What are you going to do when you put these in with 0.08 spaces?

989
01:34:11,871 --> 01:34:15,392
[SPEAKER_13]: What are you going to fit in there, a smart car?

990
01:34:16,412 --> 01:34:19,793
[SPEAKER_13]: Businesses that have five employees, are they going to all take the bus?

991
01:34:20,213 --> 01:34:20,393
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

992
01:34:21,532 --> 01:34:22,313
[SPEAKER_47]: You have 30 seconds.

993
01:34:24,134 --> 01:34:24,854
[SPEAKER_13]: What are we gonna do?

994
01:34:25,094 --> 01:34:25,855
[SPEAKER_13]: What do you look at?

995
01:34:26,795 --> 01:34:28,456
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't call it a corridor, it's a neighborhood.

996
01:34:28,677 --> 01:34:35,361
[SPEAKER_13]: You should take the people who live in that neighborhood seriously, not the people who live in the other side of Medford or 15 blocks away.

997
01:34:36,241 --> 01:34:38,243
[SPEAKER_13]: Take into account the people it affects directly.

998
01:34:38,923 --> 01:34:39,283
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

999
01:34:39,944 --> 01:34:40,344
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you.

1000
01:34:40,664 --> 01:34:49,390
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm gonna go to Anna Gunning on Zoom.

1001
01:34:52,544 --> 01:34:54,304
[SPEAKER_47]: Ada, name and address for the record, please.

1002
01:34:54,324 --> 01:34:55,165
[SPEAKER_47]: You have three minutes.

1003
01:34:58,125 --> 01:34:58,165
[SPEAKER_34]: Hi.

1004
01:34:59,405 --> 01:35:01,046
[SPEAKER_34]: I can't turn my video on.

1005
01:35:01,746 --> 01:35:02,326
[SPEAKER_34]: Ada Gunning.

1006
01:35:02,446 --> 01:35:03,726
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll turn that on in just a second.

1007
01:35:04,227 --> 01:35:06,707
[SPEAKER_34]: Ada Gunning, Forty Magoon Ave.

1008
01:35:07,747 --> 01:35:10,648
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm speaking in support of the Rezoning Initiative.

1009
01:35:11,308 --> 01:35:20,310
[SPEAKER_34]: I live in the Wellington area and I love the Salem Street Strip and walking to all the local businesses there, Dance Haven, JRA, Hair Passion, Fjord Italy.

1010
01:35:20,882 --> 01:35:30,784
[SPEAKER_34]: just a few that I have enjoyed and I'm looking forward to having even more walkable businesses and community gathering spots and hopefully a cute coffee shop.

1011
01:35:31,724 --> 01:35:37,506
[SPEAKER_34]: If we don't invest in more affordable housing in Medford, our city will soon become unaffordable to everyone.

1012
01:35:37,526 --> 01:35:48,388
[SPEAKER_34]: I think there's a perception that not changing zoning would keep things the same when in fact doing nothing would turn us into an exclusive suburb like Winchester, which I don't think anyone here wants.

1013
01:35:49,150 --> 01:35:54,451
[SPEAKER_34]: To keep things in perspective, one month ago, Cambridge eliminated single-family zoning entirely.

1014
01:35:55,051 --> 01:35:59,052
[SPEAKER_34]: And I hope we can keep that in mind when we consider this comparatively moderate plan.

1015
01:35:59,393 --> 01:36:01,373
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you very much for everything you guys have done.

1016
01:36:02,293 --> 01:36:02,753
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1017
01:36:02,773 --> 01:36:07,355
[SPEAKER_47]: We'll go back to the podium.

1018
01:36:07,375 --> 01:36:08,235
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record.

1019
01:36:08,255 --> 01:36:08,915
[SPEAKER_47]: You have three minutes.

1020
01:36:10,218 --> 01:36:10,919
[SPEAKER_49]: Great, thank you.

1021
01:36:11,299 --> 01:36:14,241
[SPEAKER_49]: Penny Taylor, I'm a proud renter at 29 Martin Street.

1022
01:36:15,562 --> 01:36:25,069
[SPEAKER_49]: I decided to stop by after going to my gym on Salem Street, shout out Reimagine, and I have never had trouble parking there, but more importantly, I can get there any which way.

1023
01:36:25,089 --> 01:36:32,654
[SPEAKER_49]: It is well-connected for walking and biking, soon to be all the more so with the Clippership Connector Path, which I will get back to, very exciting.

1024
01:36:33,895 --> 01:36:35,096
[SPEAKER_49]: Allow me a brief aside.

1025
01:36:35,356 --> 01:36:39,319
[SPEAKER_49]: I feel like seeing changes to the Salem Street area is in my family history.

1026
01:36:39,944 --> 01:36:43,965
[SPEAKER_49]: My great-great-grandparents, Sarepta and Irvine Woodward, lived in Medford.

1027
01:36:44,385 --> 01:36:52,948
[SPEAKER_49]: When I looked them up in the Medford archives of the library when I moved here, in the city directory circa 1894 or so, I wanted to see where it was that they lived.

1028
01:36:53,668 --> 01:36:54,269
[SPEAKER_49]: I looked it up.

1029
01:36:55,049 --> 01:36:56,229
[SPEAKER_49]: The address did not exist.

1030
01:36:56,930 --> 01:37:01,731
[SPEAKER_49]: I learned that it had been a house that, after my family moved out, got torn down to build 93.

1031
01:37:02,411 --> 01:37:04,352
[SPEAKER_49]: I'm so glad that I live in Medford now.

1032
01:37:05,891 --> 01:37:13,001
[SPEAKER_49]: And to keep people from being displaced from this great city, we need to see big changes to the Salem Street neighborhood again for 2025 and beyond.

1033
01:37:15,437 --> 01:37:24,421
[SPEAKER_49]: We also need to be sure to match our needs and values to work with all the other work the city is doing to encourage affordable housing development, utilize incentives.

1034
01:37:24,721 --> 01:37:33,145
[SPEAKER_49]: We need more housing, full stop, and hampering that by not allowing creative and maximal uses at this critical opportunity is unacceptable.

1035
01:37:33,585 --> 01:37:37,207
[SPEAKER_49]: So I say a big yes to maximizing our options with density.

1036
01:37:37,907 --> 01:37:39,728
[SPEAKER_49]: I want to see the intersection at park

1037
01:37:40,232 --> 01:37:42,355
[SPEAKER_49]: be an anchor with the new bike connector path.

1038
01:37:42,956 --> 01:37:46,060
[SPEAKER_49]: I think that can be really, I could see that flowing so beautifully.

1039
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:48,003
[SPEAKER_49]: It'd be a really exciting opportunity.

1040
01:37:49,446 --> 01:37:51,567
[SPEAKER_49]: I also want to comment on blocking medical businesses.

1041
01:37:51,927 --> 01:37:57,108
[SPEAKER_49]: I'm really against creating barriers to access for people and honestly seems borderline illegal.

1042
01:37:57,368 --> 01:37:59,768
[SPEAKER_49]: It certainly doesn't improve access to important services.

1043
01:37:59,788 --> 01:38:05,450
[SPEAKER_49]: I was a little disturbed that we have a green light for banks in the neighborhood while blocking medical services.

1044
01:38:05,650 --> 01:38:09,891
[SPEAKER_49]: That's not, to me, the foundation of a neighborhood that I want to see our city strive for.

1045
01:38:09,911 --> 01:38:15,132
[SPEAKER_49]: We want places for people to live happy, healthy lives, not cars and banks.

1046
01:38:15,292 --> 01:38:15,912
[SPEAKER_49]: So thank you guys.

1047
01:38:17,793 --> 01:38:18,193
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1048
01:38:20,307 --> 01:38:21,849
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm going to take us back to Zoom.

1049
01:38:22,590 --> 01:38:30,100
[SPEAKER_47]: Once again, I'm going to ask IPAD and JMN, please rename yourselves with your first and last name if you want to be recognized.

1050
01:38:30,681 --> 01:38:32,043
[SPEAKER_47]: We'll go to Andrew McRobert.

1051
01:38:32,884 --> 01:38:34,566
[SPEAKER_47]: Andrew, name and address for the record.

1052
01:38:34,626 --> 01:38:35,508
[SPEAKER_47]: You have three minutes.

1053
01:38:36,912 --> 01:38:39,534
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Andrew McRobert, 63 Kenmere Road.

1054
01:38:39,554 --> 01:38:43,838
[SPEAKER_25]: I want to add my voice as a strong support for the proposed rezoning.

1055
01:38:44,318 --> 01:39:04,915
[SPEAKER_25]: I think the compromises that have been made to the proposal along the way throughout this lengthy process have made a very fair balance between the needs of the neighborhood, the needs and wants of the neighborhood as it is now, and what it needs to grow and develop and welcome people into our community and welcome businesses.

1056
01:39:05,715 --> 01:39:17,261
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm looking forward to a more business-friendly Salem Street in Haines Square specifically, with more restaurants, cafe, retail, and community amenities for me and my wife as we raise our new family here.

1057
01:39:18,501 --> 01:39:33,109
[SPEAKER_25]: I know that street reconfiguration is not covered in zoning, but I hope additionally that multimodal complete streets are prioritized as this area develops, and I think that's probably reflected in the setback allowing 12-foot sidewalks.

1058
01:39:34,223 --> 01:39:42,288
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, and because a bunch of people have already said it, I'll also throw in my support for removing parking minimums.

1059
01:39:42,689 --> 01:39:43,009
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1060
01:39:44,970 --> 01:39:45,510
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1061
01:39:49,473 --> 01:39:51,034
[SPEAKER_47]: Going to go back to the podium.

1062
01:39:51,074 --> 01:39:52,335
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record, please.

1063
01:39:52,355 --> 01:39:53,235
[SPEAKER_47]: And you have three minutes.

1064
01:39:55,637 --> 01:39:57,158
[SPEAKER_75]: My name is Marion Tomazuk.

1065
01:39:57,318 --> 01:40:03,002
[SPEAKER_75]: I live at 29 Garfield Avenue, which is right off Salem Street across from Nappy's Restaurant.

1066
01:40:04,338 --> 01:40:08,602
[SPEAKER_75]: And I want to say, of course you already know, I am opposed to this.

1067
01:40:09,302 --> 01:40:17,549
[SPEAKER_75]: I'm opposed because number one, the misinformation that the city has been and continues to spread is a disgrace.

1068
01:40:18,670 --> 01:40:23,594
[SPEAKER_75]: You pat yourselves on the back that this is wonderful and you're helping the neighborhood, you are not.

1069
01:40:24,835 --> 01:40:31,201
[SPEAKER_75]: And these people that keep calling in and saying how wonderful it is because it's gonna have affordable housing,

1070
01:40:32,356 --> 01:40:35,419
[SPEAKER_75]: It does not promote affordable housing.

1071
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:45,609
[SPEAKER_75]: The lots are only 3000 square feet, and therefore, it will not allow any affordable housing at all.

1072
01:40:46,468 --> 01:40:52,172
[SPEAKER_75]: we will have all luxury apartments or condos built on these lots.

1073
01:40:52,632 --> 01:40:54,893
[SPEAKER_75]: And Nelson owns most of them.

1074
01:40:55,133 --> 01:40:59,956
[SPEAKER_75]: He builds only luxury apartments, condos, houses.

1075
01:41:00,917 --> 01:41:05,900
[SPEAKER_75]: Okay, the second is people keep saying, I want this walkable neighborhood.

1076
01:41:06,520 --> 01:41:10,042
[SPEAKER_75]: It is now a walkable, beautiful area.

1077
01:41:10,763 --> 01:41:13,965
[SPEAKER_75]: I walk it every day that it's not freezing.

1078
01:41:15,071 --> 01:41:25,615
[SPEAKER_75]: But when we change it with the new upzoning you want to put in, it is going to destroy the local businesses because you are going to change the area.

1079
01:41:25,655 --> 01:41:28,696
[SPEAKER_75]: Most of these local businesses do not own the buildings.

1080
01:41:29,076 --> 01:41:31,617
[SPEAKER_75]: They are owned by LLCs.

1081
01:41:31,917 --> 01:41:39,160
[SPEAKER_75]: The LLCs will take over, and they will be sold, and the businesses will be gone, and apartments will be in their places.

1082
01:41:40,173 --> 01:41:50,780
[SPEAKER_75]: No business is going to come in and be told they will not have parking, that they will be on the bottom of a big apartment complex.

1083
01:41:51,801 --> 01:41:54,162
[SPEAKER_75]: The traffic on Salem Street is horrendous.

1084
01:41:54,883 --> 01:42:02,088
[SPEAKER_75]: It is not going to be any better when you put in 1,000 or 500, we're talking really 1,000 at least, units.

1085
01:42:05,493 --> 01:42:07,595
[SPEAKER_75]: We are not a rapid transit area.

1086
01:42:08,216 --> 01:42:10,298
[SPEAKER_75]: West Bedford is a rapid transit area.

1087
01:42:10,578 --> 01:42:12,360
[SPEAKER_75]: You are not putting density there.

1088
01:42:12,741 --> 01:42:15,343
[SPEAKER_75]: You are not putting density in any other area.

1089
01:42:15,483 --> 01:42:19,187
[SPEAKER_75]: Only the most dense part of West of Bedford are you doing it.

1090
01:42:19,808 --> 01:42:24,793
[SPEAKER_75]: And you seem to forget, like the other person said, this is not a quarter.

1091
01:42:24,913 --> 01:42:25,834
[SPEAKER_75]: This is a neighborhood.

1092
01:42:25,894 --> 01:42:26,555
[SPEAKER_75]: We are people.

1093
01:42:26,615 --> 01:42:28,357
[SPEAKER_75]: We deserve quality of life.

1094
01:42:28,947 --> 01:42:29,747
[SPEAKER_47]: You have 30 seconds.

1095
01:42:30,068 --> 01:42:33,229
[SPEAKER_75]: This area cannot support the necessary services.

1096
01:42:33,329 --> 01:42:39,272
[SPEAKER_75]: The police, the fire department, the water department, all of these areas should have been considered.

1097
01:42:39,332 --> 01:42:40,613
[SPEAKER_75]: We have brownouts now.

1098
01:42:40,953 --> 01:42:42,354
[SPEAKER_75]: We have a lot of problems.

1099
01:42:42,454 --> 01:42:43,654
[SPEAKER_75]: We have lots of problems.

1100
01:42:44,054 --> 01:42:45,195
[SPEAKER_75]: Nobody is considering it.

1101
01:42:45,575 --> 01:42:46,376
[SPEAKER_75]: Thank you very much.

1102
01:42:46,396 --> 01:42:48,156
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1103
01:42:48,176 --> 01:42:54,520
[SPEAKER_47]: Before I go back to Zoom,

1104
01:42:55,695 --> 01:43:00,139
[SPEAKER_47]: Once again, iPad and D Silva, please rename yourselves with a thank you.

1105
01:43:00,259 --> 01:43:04,783
[SPEAKER_47]: Donna, iPad, if you could please rename yourself with a first and last name to be recognized.

1106
01:43:05,203 --> 01:43:06,624
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm going to go to Martha Andrus.

1107
01:43:06,704 --> 01:43:09,026
[SPEAKER_47]: Martha, name and address for the record, please.

1108
01:43:13,170 --> 01:43:15,632
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, hello, I'm Martha Andrus.

1109
01:43:15,732 --> 01:43:19,715
[SPEAKER_09]: I live at 45 Kilgore Avenue in Medford.

1110
01:43:19,775 --> 01:43:20,656
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a bad cold.

1111
01:43:20,676 --> 01:43:22,097
[SPEAKER_09]: I apologize for my voice.

1112
01:43:23,042 --> 01:43:26,645
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I support the zoning proposal that's before you.

1113
01:43:27,746 --> 01:43:41,356
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I think it fits with the overall plan for Medford, which has some areas with fairly high density and some more residential village, what I would call village centers.

1114
01:43:41,796 --> 01:43:43,597
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's a very modest plan.

1115
01:43:43,657 --> 01:43:47,020
[SPEAKER_09]: I know the planners have listened to, um,

1116
01:43:47,618 --> 01:43:53,045
[SPEAKER_09]: the community concerns and have lowered some of the...

1117
01:43:54,684 --> 01:43:58,586
[SPEAKER_09]: dimensional limits in some of the districts.

1118
01:43:58,646 --> 01:44:03,228
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think it's really important.

1119
01:44:03,348 --> 01:44:05,009
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a very modest plan.

1120
01:44:05,029 --> 01:44:11,072
[SPEAKER_09]: It will allow some good things to happen in terms of businesses and housing.

1121
01:44:11,992 --> 01:44:18,675
[SPEAKER_09]: And it also, you know, it's one piece of improvement to the area.

1122
01:44:18,735 --> 01:44:19,536
[SPEAKER_09]: We still need

1123
01:44:21,108 --> 01:44:24,030
[SPEAKER_09]: parking and traffic improvements.

1124
01:44:24,491 --> 01:44:33,538
[SPEAKER_09]: That's obvious to anyone who has been there and we need obviously infrastructure, but those are not things that go in the zoning.

1125
01:44:33,559 --> 01:44:38,203
[SPEAKER_09]: The zoning is just one piece and I think this is well done and I support it.

1126
01:44:38,263 --> 01:44:38,723
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1127
01:44:40,244 --> 01:44:40,705
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1128
01:44:40,725 --> 01:44:44,388
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm going to go back to the podium.

1129
01:44:44,608 --> 01:44:45,789
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record, please.

1130
01:44:45,829 --> 01:44:46,450
[SPEAKER_47]: You have three minutes.

1131
01:44:47,527 --> 01:44:49,028
[SPEAKER_63]: Yes, I'm Elizabeth Kramer.

1132
01:44:49,328 --> 01:44:56,572
[SPEAKER_63]: I live at 60 Pleasant Street in Medford, and I am opposed to the rezoning plan for Salem Street.

1133
01:44:58,453 --> 01:45:03,515
[SPEAKER_63]: I'm concerned about the density, the traffic, particularly the traffic.

1134
01:45:05,076 --> 01:45:07,598
[SPEAKER_63]: I'm not opposed to change.

1135
01:45:07,798 --> 01:45:09,839
[SPEAKER_63]: I've lived in Medford for

1136
01:45:11,209 --> 01:45:16,398
[SPEAKER_63]: Almost 65 years when we came here, it was 93 was just being constructed.

1137
01:45:16,578 --> 01:45:17,619
[SPEAKER_63]: We watched all of that.

1138
01:45:18,261 --> 01:45:19,442
[SPEAKER_63]: I've raised a family here.

1139
01:45:20,187 --> 01:45:22,669
[SPEAKER_63]: I have grandchildren that would love to live in Medford.

1140
01:45:22,969 --> 01:45:31,256
[SPEAKER_63]: I agree there's not enough housing, but they also work outside of the city and they have cars.

1141
01:45:31,857 --> 01:45:33,298
[SPEAKER_63]: Traffic is going to get worse.

1142
01:45:33,498 --> 01:45:44,067
[SPEAKER_63]: And I really believe there should be studies done for traffic and other things when you're moving forward and consider the people that live in that neighborhood.

1143
01:45:44,588 --> 01:45:45,008
[SPEAKER_63]: Thank you.

1144
01:45:46,609 --> 01:45:46,930
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1145
01:45:50,049 --> 01:45:51,350
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm going to go back to Zoom.

1146
01:45:51,370 --> 01:45:54,031
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm going to go to Nathan Kando.

1147
01:45:54,111 --> 01:45:55,871
[SPEAKER_47]: Nathan, name and address for the record, please.

1148
01:45:55,891 --> 01:45:56,652
[SPEAKER_47]: You have three minutes.

1149
01:45:58,793 --> 01:46:01,114
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, my name is Nathan Kando, 94th Street.

1150
01:46:01,694 --> 01:46:05,555
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm just calling in in strong support of the proposed rezoning project.

1151
01:46:06,596 --> 01:46:13,059
[SPEAKER_21]: I am for a less restrictive zoning for affordable housing for protesting access.

1152
01:46:13,479 --> 01:46:17,520
[SPEAKER_21]: And I do not believe that parking minimums should be a detriment to this plan.

1153
01:46:18,081 --> 01:46:18,681
[SPEAKER_21]: That is all, thank you.

1154
01:46:22,075 --> 01:46:22,415
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1155
01:46:24,077 --> 01:46:25,058
[SPEAKER_47]: We'll return to the podium.

1156
01:46:25,099 --> 01:46:26,180
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record, please.

1157
01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:26,941
[SPEAKER_47]: You have three minutes.

1158
01:46:28,843 --> 01:46:31,025
[SPEAKER_20]: Mark Curtis, 89 Traincroft Street in Medford.

1159
01:46:33,062 --> 01:46:57,787
[SPEAKER_20]: I just want to say that I really appreciate all of the work that has been done by the City Council and the staff, and also all of the community engagement that has happened here in a very respectful way tonight with people that have strong opinions, but are stating them very respectfully.

1160
01:46:57,807 --> 01:46:59,187
[SPEAKER_20]: This is a

1161
01:47:00,207 --> 01:47:01,608
[SPEAKER_20]: really hard process.

1162
01:47:02,108 --> 01:47:05,630
[SPEAKER_20]: There's a reason that this hasn't been done in over 50 years in Medford.

1163
01:47:06,611 --> 01:47:07,932
[SPEAKER_20]: It is intimidating.

1164
01:47:08,732 --> 01:47:14,996
[SPEAKER_20]: And it brings out a lot of fear and apprehension in people.

1165
01:47:15,016 --> 01:47:23,281
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think that this proposal is a pretty moderate change.

1166
01:47:24,913 --> 01:47:29,676
[SPEAKER_20]: to this neighborhood and also to the other two neighborhoods that have been done before.

1167
01:47:29,696 --> 01:47:47,445
[SPEAKER_20]: I just want to make one point, which is that every neighborhood in Medford has to have changes to their zoning in order to promote a modest amount of additional housing and in order to

1168
01:47:48,652 --> 01:48:02,512
[SPEAKER_20]: allow our community to continue to be an affordable place to raise a family, and in my case, to have adult children move back, which I would love them both to be able to do.

1169
01:48:03,553 --> 01:48:08,495
[SPEAKER_20]: So I just want to say how much I appreciate your efforts and I support this proposal.

1170
01:48:08,616 --> 01:48:12,818
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not perfect, but it's much better than what we have now.

1171
01:48:13,238 --> 01:48:18,160
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think that is something that will make a positive difference in Medford.

1172
01:48:18,460 --> 01:48:18,820
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1173
01:48:19,701 --> 01:48:20,141
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1174
01:48:20,161 --> 01:48:24,903
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm going to go back to Zoom.

1175
01:48:24,943 --> 01:48:26,844
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm going to go to Donna Silva.

1176
01:48:27,024 --> 01:48:29,725
[SPEAKER_47]: Donna, name and address for the record, please.

1177
01:48:29,745 --> 01:48:30,546
[SPEAKER_47]: And you have three minutes.

1178
01:48:38,067 --> 01:48:40,228
[SPEAKER_47]: Donna, I've requested that you unmute yourself.

1179
01:48:42,309 --> 01:48:44,450
[SPEAKER_47]: You should see a button on your screen that says unmute.

1180
01:48:53,514 --> 01:48:54,875
[SPEAKER_47]: All right, Donna, we'll come back to you.

1181
01:48:54,895 --> 01:48:56,395
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm gonna go to Jennifer O'Callaghan.

1182
01:48:56,475 --> 01:48:58,716
[SPEAKER_47]: Jennifer, name and address for the record.

1183
01:48:58,736 --> 01:48:59,577
[SPEAKER_47]: You have three minutes.

1184
01:49:04,885 --> 01:49:12,607
[SPEAKER_50]: Hi, this is Jennifer Callahan, 19 Paris Street, and I'm calling in to express my concern about the current proposal.

1185
01:49:13,447 --> 01:49:32,712
[SPEAKER_50]: It's not sufficient in terms of addressing the concerns that have been raised by the neighborhood regarding the lack of studies, as well as concerns around the extent to which

1186
01:49:33,298 --> 01:49:37,080
[SPEAKER_50]: The zoning will only address by right.

1187
01:49:37,760 --> 01:49:52,786
[SPEAKER_50]: That does nothing to speak to the level of greedy developers who are going to come and seek additional variances and, um, utilize incentive zoning to the fullest extent.

1188
01:49:54,147 --> 01:49:57,608
[SPEAKER_50]: It's disappointing that Medford has become the pick me city.

1189
01:50:00,018 --> 01:50:08,481
[SPEAKER_50]: to just allow things for free by those who want to change and diminish our quality of life.

1190
01:50:09,602 --> 01:50:10,022
[SPEAKER_50]: Thank you.

1191
01:50:11,543 --> 01:50:12,183
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1192
01:50:13,444 --> 01:50:15,484
[SPEAKER_47]: Go back to the podium, name and address for the record.

1193
01:50:15,544 --> 01:50:16,565
[SPEAKER_47]: You have three minutes.

1194
01:50:17,763 --> 01:50:21,486
[SPEAKER_55]: Hi, I'm Stephanie Gernsmeyer, 54 Whitney Road.

1195
01:50:22,267 --> 01:50:26,430
[SPEAKER_55]: My husband and I were lucky enough to buy our house back in 2002.

1196
01:50:26,470 --> 01:50:29,953
[SPEAKER_55]: I last owned a car in 1989.

1197
01:50:31,734 --> 01:50:35,057
[SPEAKER_55]: So I will just speak on a high level.

1198
01:50:35,978 --> 01:50:45,846
[SPEAKER_55]: I have not done sufficient homework to speak to Same Old Street, but it is imperative that we upgrade the zoning in every part of Medford.

1199
01:50:46,543 --> 01:50:52,829
[SPEAKER_55]: to allow the gradual increase in density to occur with the turnover housing.

1200
01:50:52,869 --> 01:50:58,154
[SPEAKER_55]: It's not like anybody comes in with the bulldozers tomorrow when you change the zoning.

1201
01:51:00,683 --> 01:51:07,230
[SPEAKER_55]: You know, I also want to sign on to, you know, I don't think there should be parking minimums at all.

1202
01:51:08,511 --> 01:51:21,204
[SPEAKER_55]: What there should be are parking maximums and very strong incentives so that you have a critical mass of people who just do not have cars.

1203
01:51:26,597 --> 01:51:31,618
[SPEAKER_55]: you know, that isn't feasible for everyone, but you know, people should pay for their own parking.

1204
01:51:33,079 --> 01:51:43,121
[SPEAKER_55]: And there should be very strong benefits to those who do not bring a car into their neighborhood, you know, to just not have any car at all.

1205
01:51:43,161 --> 01:51:46,482
[SPEAKER_55]: You should pay less for an apartment if you have no car.

1206
01:51:48,462 --> 01:51:50,923
[SPEAKER_47]: Please, please take your comments outside.

1207
01:51:50,963 --> 01:51:56,024
[SPEAKER_47]: If you're gonna comment, there's been a lot of conversation and everyone's gonna be respectful and I'll give you another 15 seconds.

1208
01:51:57,347 --> 01:52:01,130
[SPEAKER_55]: But yeah, I guess the bottom line is people like me, we're not traffic.

1209
01:52:01,330 --> 01:52:05,434
[SPEAKER_55]: You could bring hundreds of us in and you're the traffic, we are not.

1210
01:52:06,115 --> 01:52:08,537
[SPEAKER_55]: You can have a high density of people without cars.

1211
01:52:08,557 --> 01:52:12,120
[SPEAKER_55]: And I'll leave it there.

1212
01:52:12,140 --> 01:52:13,701
[SPEAKER_55]: Thanks.

1213
01:52:13,841 --> 01:52:14,482
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you very much.

1214
01:52:18,995 --> 01:52:20,236
[SPEAKER_47]: We've had a good night, y'all.

1215
01:52:20,637 --> 01:52:21,538
[SPEAKER_47]: We've had a good night.

1216
01:52:21,838 --> 01:52:24,742
[SPEAKER_47]: And I just want us to try to respect everybody who comments.

1217
01:52:26,404 --> 01:52:30,128
[SPEAKER_47]: We've had claps at the end, depending on who we support, that's fine.

1218
01:52:30,228 --> 01:52:35,094
[SPEAKER_47]: Please just keep the rest of the disruptions to a minimum so that we can hear from everyone in an equitable manner.

1219
01:52:35,294 --> 01:52:36,055
[SPEAKER_47]: And I appreciate.

1220
01:52:37,007 --> 01:52:41,010
[SPEAKER_47]: your respect for the process and for civic engagement.

1221
01:52:41,630 --> 01:52:42,991
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm going to go back to Zoom.

1222
01:52:43,672 --> 01:52:53,598
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm going to go to Jean Mizzo in one second, but iPad and Janine's iPad, please rename yourselves to a first and last name to be recognized on Zoom.

1223
01:52:54,319 --> 01:52:58,842
[SPEAKER_47]: Jean, name and address for the record, and you'll have three minutes.

1224
01:53:01,524 --> 01:53:02,985
[SPEAKER_80]: Mr. President, can you hear me okay?

1225
01:53:03,785 --> 01:53:04,406
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes, we can.

1226
01:53:04,982 --> 01:53:05,303
[SPEAKER_80]: Thank you.

1227
01:53:05,343 --> 01:53:09,158
[SPEAKER_80]: First, let me take the opportunity to also extend my condolences on the loss of your friend.

1228
01:53:10,363 --> 01:53:11,484
[SPEAKER_80]: My name's Jean Nuzzo.

1229
01:53:12,785 --> 01:53:16,749
[SPEAKER_80]: I live at 35 Parris Street in the heart of the Glenwood neighborhood being discussed tonight.

1230
01:53:17,670 --> 01:53:29,100
[SPEAKER_80]: The recently released state housing report indicates that we need 220,000 units in this state by 2035, but it doesn't indicate that all of that needs to come from the city of Medford and specifically this Glenwood neighborhood.

1231
01:53:29,861 --> 01:53:33,525
[SPEAKER_80]: Affordable housing is important, but so is the question, affordable to whom?

1232
01:53:34,245 --> 01:53:35,907
[SPEAKER_80]: I want to be clear and on the record.

1233
01:53:36,347 --> 01:53:46,274
[SPEAKER_80]: A yes vote tonight will gentrify out the marginalized in our environmental justice neighborhood currently living in affordable homes in favor of developer profit and the affluent who want to come here.

1234
01:53:46,955 --> 01:53:58,523
[SPEAKER_80]: I find the need to again iterate tonight that parcel along side streets should not be included in corridor nor urban zones as side streets do not qualify elsewhere in the city in proximity to actual transit.

1235
01:53:59,163 --> 01:54:06,747
[SPEAKER_80]: The MBTA is not improving our transit here, they're splitting our single bus route and assuming everyone is going to be able to take a bus is wishful thinking.

1236
01:54:07,247 --> 01:54:12,010
[SPEAKER_80]: The differently abled don't get the same spoons as you do, and not all of them get a blue placard.

1237
01:54:12,630 --> 01:54:23,196
[SPEAKER_80]: The fact that we are on the precipice of this proposal to further densify and exacerbate the inequities and density in this area relative to the remainder of the city is deeply unjust.

1238
01:54:23,976 --> 01:54:42,765
[SPEAKER_80]: that we are going to pass the zoning without even the most baseline of industry standards and documentation such as existing conditions, infrastructure impact, and constructability within your proposed minimums, which will open the city to a variety of liabilities you're going to learn about later on, and not even the most rudimentary of an urban master plan is mind-boggling.

1239
01:54:43,345 --> 01:54:46,408
[SPEAKER_80]: The studies that need to be done aren't completed parcel by parcel.

1240
01:54:46,728 --> 01:54:50,852
[SPEAKER_80]: That is death by paper cuts, and it puts the price squarely on the taxpayer.

1241
01:54:51,293 --> 01:55:00,581
[SPEAKER_80]: Cambridge, yes, has just passed landmark changes to zoning with four-story multifamily by right, but it's a 5,000 square foot lot, and here we're at 3,000.

1242
01:55:01,082 --> 01:55:07,428
[SPEAKER_80]: So even Cambridge thinks it's utterly inappropriate to have anything less than 5,000 square feet anywhere.

1243
01:55:07,868 --> 01:55:27,544
[SPEAKER_80]: Truly, we must take a step back to move forward properly and assure that we're following industry best practices, looking out for the marginalized within our community, all while figuring out the way to find the balance between affordability, density, human scale development, activated places, placeholders, and an interesting place to live.

1244
01:55:28,465 --> 01:55:29,506
[SPEAKER_80]: I appreciate the time.

1245
01:55:29,826 --> 01:55:36,349
[SPEAKER_80]: I know that this won't happen swiftly for some, but the idea that it won't happen swiftly in Glenwood is a farce.

1246
01:55:36,829 --> 01:55:40,611
[SPEAKER_80]: For the developers, it's all about the financial modeling and return on investment.

1247
01:55:41,032 --> 01:55:47,215
[SPEAKER_80]: As I look out my window tonight, I see a new backhoe across the street in the side yard on the corner of Tainter.

1248
01:55:47,735 --> 01:55:50,817
[SPEAKER_80]: The lot is clear and ready for their permits in the coming days.

1249
01:55:51,197 --> 01:55:57,100
[SPEAKER_80]: So yes, it in fact is coming to Glenwood and it is burgeoning and just waiting for those new permit applications

1250
01:55:57,400 --> 01:55:58,500
[SPEAKER_80]: to be able to be filed.

1251
01:55:58,840 --> 01:55:59,681
[SPEAKER_80]: Thank you very much.

1252
01:56:01,561 --> 01:56:02,021
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1253
01:56:02,041 --> 01:56:09,803
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm going to go back to the podium.

1254
01:56:09,823 --> 01:56:11,063
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record, please.

1255
01:56:11,103 --> 01:56:11,743
[SPEAKER_47]: You have three minutes.

1256
01:56:15,104 --> 01:56:18,125
[SPEAKER_68]: Hi, my name is Rosemary Missick, 36 Pool Street.

1257
01:56:20,025 --> 01:56:22,146
[SPEAKER_68]: I am a lifelong resident of

1258
01:56:23,558 --> 01:56:29,763
[SPEAKER_68]: actually my grandfather bought the house in 1922 when it was only two years old, so it's been in the family for years.

1259
01:56:31,264 --> 01:56:40,511
[SPEAKER_68]: As a senior and a lifelong resident of the Glenwood section of Medford, I am asking that studies be done before making a final decision on zoning.

1260
01:56:40,932 --> 01:56:48,998
[SPEAKER_68]: Traffic studies are needed for this section of Route 60 since it's part of a major thoroughfare and truck route between 93 and Malden.

1261
01:56:50,339 --> 01:56:50,720
[SPEAKER_68]: Also,

1262
01:56:51,917 --> 01:56:58,823
[SPEAKER_68]: Parking, yes, parking does need to be addressed, but I tend to go a little the other way.

1263
01:57:00,004 --> 01:57:13,254
[SPEAKER_68]: There are seniors and handicapped and physically challenged residents who need to drive to Haines Square from the outskirts to visit local businesses.

1264
01:57:14,916 --> 01:57:17,718
[SPEAKER_68]: Not everyone can walk or ride a bike.

1265
01:57:19,783 --> 01:57:21,744
[SPEAKER_68]: You have to take that into consideration.

1266
01:57:22,224 --> 01:57:24,885
[SPEAKER_68]: There has to be parking of some sort.

1267
01:57:25,525 --> 01:57:31,387
[SPEAKER_68]: Getting rid of parking minimums just isn't going to do it, as long as there's handicapped and elderly.

1268
01:57:31,668 --> 01:57:35,109
[SPEAKER_68]: What are we supposed to do, stay home?

1269
01:57:37,090 --> 01:57:38,130
[SPEAKER_68]: We're more than just numbers.

1270
01:57:40,331 --> 01:57:40,711
[SPEAKER_68]: Thank you.

1271
01:57:40,731 --> 01:57:45,673
[SPEAKER_68]: I really, for on the record, I cannot

1272
01:57:47,020 --> 01:57:57,504
[SPEAKER_68]: I cannot be in favor of the zoning as it is until the traffic studies are done and until handicap parking.

1273
01:57:57,584 --> 01:58:01,865
[SPEAKER_68]: And even I personally have issues with my knees.

1274
01:58:03,466 --> 01:58:11,789
[SPEAKER_68]: I don't feel maybe it's a little bit of pride or whatever, but I do not feel qualified for a handicap placard, but I need to be close to where I'm going.

1275
01:58:13,483 --> 01:58:14,704
[SPEAKER_68]: I can't walk to the square.

1276
01:58:14,844 --> 01:58:21,107
[SPEAKER_68]: It's a half a mile from my house to Haines Square, because I used to be able to walk it all the time.

1277
01:58:21,207 --> 01:58:22,107
[SPEAKER_68]: I can't do that anymore.

1278
01:58:22,187 --> 01:58:23,148
[SPEAKER_68]: I have to drive down there.

1279
01:58:24,489 --> 01:58:25,249
[SPEAKER_68]: So what am I going to do?

1280
01:58:25,609 --> 01:58:30,592
[SPEAKER_68]: And my neighborhood is full of elderly people, and they're handicapped people.

1281
01:58:31,612 --> 01:58:33,373
[SPEAKER_68]: And not once have I heard anything.

1282
01:58:33,453 --> 01:58:34,754
[SPEAKER_68]: Everybody's for walkability.

1283
01:58:34,814 --> 01:58:36,915
[SPEAKER_68]: Ride your bike.

1284
01:58:37,035 --> 01:58:38,816
[SPEAKER_68]: Unicorns will be blowing rainbows.

1285
01:58:40,953 --> 01:58:43,074
[SPEAKER_68]: You know, it is what it is.

1286
01:58:43,274 --> 01:58:50,675
[SPEAKER_68]: There's old people in these neighborhoods, in the outskirt neighborhoods that use Haines Square, that use the businesses on Salem Street.

1287
01:58:51,616 --> 01:58:52,976
[SPEAKER_68]: They have to have a way of getting there.

1288
01:58:53,016 --> 01:58:55,717
[SPEAKER_68]: They have to have, they have to be able to park somewhere.

1289
01:58:57,177 --> 01:58:59,477
[SPEAKER_68]: So that's it for me.

1290
01:59:00,918 --> 01:59:01,278
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1291
01:59:06,998 --> 01:59:15,544
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm going to go in a second to Megan on Zoom, but if iPad and Eunice could just rename themselves to a first and last name to be recognized.

1292
01:59:15,664 --> 01:59:18,386
[SPEAKER_47]: Megan, name and address for the record.

1293
01:59:18,426 --> 01:59:19,647
[SPEAKER_47]: Megan, you have three minutes.

1294
01:59:23,863 --> 01:59:25,344
[SPEAKER_57]: Hi there, my name is Megan Mars.

1295
01:59:25,404 --> 01:59:26,845
[SPEAKER_57]: I'm at 71 Clark Street.

1296
01:59:27,285 --> 01:59:30,647
[SPEAKER_57]: I'm speaking today in strong support of the Salem Street zoning changes.

1297
01:59:31,347 --> 01:59:36,070
[SPEAKER_57]: And really, I did prefer the original proposal, but I will gladly take the current proposal.

1298
01:59:36,810 --> 01:59:42,514
[SPEAKER_57]: Our city is way behind when it comes to the kind of growth our neighbors have done, and I know as a city, we can do more.

1299
01:59:42,534 --> 01:59:49,218
[SPEAKER_57]: I hope to see similar zoning changes like this proposed all across the city, as well as an elimination of parking mandates.

1300
01:59:49,998 --> 01:59:52,840
[SPEAKER_57]: As many of you know, our country is in the middle of a loneliness epidemic.

1301
01:59:53,200 --> 02:00:03,127
[SPEAKER_57]: We're all struggling to build and maintain community when so much of our focus is driven to apps and online interactions that just breed more division and encourage fear mongering.

1302
02:00:03,787 --> 02:00:10,472
[SPEAKER_57]: The way we build and foster community in Medford is by creating small local businesses, citizens can safely walk,

1303
02:00:11,052 --> 02:00:19,299
[SPEAKER_57]: and bike to and by creating more housing so that we can keep living in Medford accessible for people of all kinds of backgrounds and careers.

1304
02:00:20,180 --> 02:00:28,948
[SPEAKER_57]: I've heard a lot of concerns about car traffic, which I understand, but I just want to say building better walkability infrastructure is how we can reduce car traffic.

1305
02:00:29,468 --> 02:00:37,055
[SPEAKER_57]: And if we're open to better pedestrian and cyclist infrastructure, we can worry less about being slaves to our cars and imagine a more exciting future.

1306
02:00:37,815 --> 02:00:41,658
[SPEAKER_57]: I want a city that focuses on growth, and that's why I support the Salem Street zoning.

1307
02:00:41,858 --> 02:00:42,719
[SPEAKER_57]: Thank you, that's all.

1308
02:00:45,041 --> 02:00:45,621
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1309
02:00:45,641 --> 02:00:46,722
[SPEAKER_47]: We'll go back to the podium.

1310
02:00:46,742 --> 02:00:48,083
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record.

1311
02:00:48,103 --> 02:00:48,784
[SPEAKER_47]: You have three minutes.

1312
02:00:50,565 --> 02:00:52,387
[SPEAKER_69]: Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street.

1313
02:00:52,747 --> 02:00:58,611
[SPEAKER_69]: So I have here the petition from change.org with over 1100 signatures opposed to the Salem Street corridor zoning.

1314
02:01:06,510 --> 02:01:08,450
[SPEAKER_69]: We're not asking for no zoning changes.

1315
02:01:08,510 --> 02:01:12,671
[SPEAKER_69]: We're asking for the studies to be conducted and the zoning to be written based on that data.

1316
02:01:13,031 --> 02:01:14,211
[SPEAKER_69]: This isn't about opinions.

1317
02:01:14,271 --> 02:01:16,532
[SPEAKER_69]: It isn't about how many people raise their hands and say, yay.

1318
02:01:16,992 --> 02:01:19,192
[SPEAKER_69]: This isn't just about creating housing.

1319
02:01:19,572 --> 02:01:26,654
[SPEAKER_69]: There is a large scale increase in zoning concentrated into an area that is already dense and lacking in transit access.

1320
02:01:27,454 --> 02:01:34,195
[SPEAKER_69]: Our quality of life, existing conditions and results of the necessary studies are what should largely shape this zoning.

1321
02:01:35,055 --> 02:01:38,696
[SPEAKER_69]: The only argument for packing it all in here is that it's already dense.

1322
02:01:38,916 --> 02:01:39,597
[SPEAKER_69]: So who cares?

1323
02:01:40,117 --> 02:01:49,640
[SPEAKER_69]: If the density was spread more equitably, then our less dense neighbors with larger lots would be able to relieve us of some of the burden to focus so much density here.

1324
02:01:50,556 --> 02:02:08,071
[SPEAKER_69]: Residents have been saying that reducing lot size from 10k to 3k makes the planned zoning impossible and at the March 5th CDB meeting Emily Ennis from Innes Associates admitted that there are several infeasibilities in the current zoning proposal which are not resolved before passing it back to you.

1325
02:02:09,210 --> 02:02:18,241
[SPEAKER_69]: So one of the reasons she gave for the failure was the small lots that made it impossible to add parking and hope to change the parking minimums after the zoning has passed.

1326
02:02:18,581 --> 02:02:23,787
[SPEAKER_69]: Those small lots though also make the buildings too small to require affordable units.

1327
02:02:24,148 --> 02:02:25,890
[SPEAKER_69]: So there's no affordable housing coming here.

1328
02:02:31,178 --> 02:02:37,046
[SPEAKER_69]: Parking is already difficult here, and a second reduction in the parking minimums will have a profound impact on our quality of life.

1329
02:02:37,507 --> 02:02:40,611
[SPEAKER_69]: That 0.8 spaces isn't sounding so far-fetched now, is it?

1330
02:02:41,685 --> 02:02:53,131
[SPEAKER_69]: The studies required and outlined in the comprehensive plan, which I urge you to go back and conduct, and not pass impossible zoning, only to later take out parking minimums to try to squeeze it in.

1331
02:02:53,712 --> 02:03:03,977
[SPEAKER_69]: These studies should include projected development volume, traffic analysis, shadow studies, environmental impact estimates, and the other studies deemed appropriate to the area.

1332
02:03:04,377 --> 02:03:10,641
[SPEAKER_69]: The full picture should be clear before a neighborhood is targeted, or as you like to say, up-zoned moderately.

1333
02:03:11,381 --> 02:03:15,869
[SPEAKER_69]: Despite the call for more density near transit, you will note that we aren't near transit.

1334
02:03:16,430 --> 02:03:21,419
[SPEAKER_69]: The most frequent bus that runs down Salem Street is the out-of-service bus on the way to the bus yard.

1335
02:03:22,577 --> 02:03:25,278
[SPEAKER_69]: Please recognize that we are a neighborhood.

1336
02:03:25,458 --> 02:03:30,361
[SPEAKER_69]: We deserve to have quality of life and so do the people you claim to want to build housing for.

1337
02:03:30,441 --> 02:03:31,482
[SPEAKER_47]: So you have 30 seconds.

1338
02:03:31,702 --> 02:03:49,211
[SPEAKER_69]: No one dreams of living in an apartment building with little to no green space because 80% lot coverage is allowed and the green score can be waved away with 12 foot sidewalks that'll exacerbate the heat islands that are already here and to have to play where, where can I park every time they drive their car.

1339
02:03:50,051 --> 02:03:54,634
[SPEAKER_69]: Impacts are important to identify and that work, among others, has not been done here.

1340
02:03:55,254 --> 02:03:58,076
[SPEAKER_69]: Conduct the studies and use them to inform the zoning.

1341
02:03:58,456 --> 02:04:00,258
[SPEAKER_69]: Don't pass impossible zoning.

1342
02:04:00,658 --> 02:04:09,163
[SPEAKER_69]: Oh, and give the Glenwood neighborhood a call when you decide to zone transit proximate High Street at the same level that we're getting.

1343
02:04:09,643 --> 02:04:11,925
[SPEAKER_69]: But alas, that's not in your zoning plan.

1344
02:04:12,305 --> 02:04:13,286
[SPEAKER_69]: One wonders why.

1345
02:04:13,566 --> 02:04:14,006
[SPEAKER_69]: Thank you.

1346
02:04:14,026 --> 02:04:14,827
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you, Cheryl.

1347
02:04:19,441 --> 02:04:22,082
[SPEAKER_47]: We'll go to Zoom, go to Janine.

1348
02:04:26,084 --> 02:04:27,825
[SPEAKER_47]: Janine, name and address for the record, please.

1349
02:04:27,845 --> 02:04:28,505
[SPEAKER_47]: You have three minutes.

1350
02:04:36,449 --> 02:04:38,110
[SPEAKER_47]: Janine, I've hit the ask to unmute button.

1351
02:04:38,150 --> 02:04:39,431
[SPEAKER_47]: If you could hit the unmute button.

1352
02:04:39,451 --> 02:04:44,813
[SPEAKER_47]: All right, we'll come back to Janine.

1353
02:04:44,933 --> 02:04:46,614
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm gonna try Donna Silva again.

1354
02:04:46,674 --> 02:04:48,295
[SPEAKER_47]: Donna, I'm going to ask you to unmute.

1355
02:04:53,152 --> 02:04:56,233
[SPEAKER_47]: Hi Donna you have three minutes, name and address for the record please.

1356
02:04:57,414 --> 02:04:58,034
[SPEAKER_81]: Can you hear me.

1357
02:04:59,155 --> 02:04:59,675
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes, we can.

1358
02:04:59,775 --> 02:05:03,477
[SPEAKER_47]: Oh, we could for a second but then you muted.

1359
02:05:03,517 --> 02:05:04,818
[SPEAKER_47]: We can hear, we can hear you now.

1360
02:05:05,478 --> 02:05:08,560
[SPEAKER_81]: Great my iPad wasn't working so I'm on my laptop.

1361
02:05:10,101 --> 02:05:13,543
[SPEAKER_81]: I am Donna Silva 1536 mystic Valley Parkway.

1362
02:05:14,691 --> 02:05:19,952
[SPEAKER_81]: pretty much almost a lifelong resident of Medford, raised two daughters here, have grandchildren.

1363
02:05:20,192 --> 02:05:21,852
[SPEAKER_81]: And I do love Medford.

1364
02:05:22,672 --> 02:05:28,033
[SPEAKER_81]: And I do want to see my grandchildren grow up in safe neighborhoods.

1365
02:05:28,354 --> 02:05:35,235
[SPEAKER_81]: And yes, I do love the whole concept of having some affordable housing in Medford.

1366
02:05:35,915 --> 02:05:39,936
[SPEAKER_81]: I don't live in the Salem Street neighborhood.

1367
02:05:40,096 --> 02:05:41,236
[SPEAKER_81]: I overlook Mystic Lake.

1368
02:05:42,581 --> 02:05:48,764
[SPEAKER_81]: I mean, and so I have, it's not congested where I live.

1369
02:05:50,065 --> 02:05:50,825
[SPEAKER_81]: Would I like it?

1370
02:05:51,085 --> 02:05:51,285
[SPEAKER_81]: No.

1371
02:05:52,826 --> 02:06:05,773
[SPEAKER_81]: However, I'm concerned for the people, the neighbors that live there in the congestion that's going to happen as one gentleman did bring up both solar.

1372
02:06:06,613 --> 02:06:10,195
[SPEAKER_81]: That is concerned because I just had someone at my house for solar panels.

1373
02:06:12,115 --> 02:06:17,636
[SPEAKER_81]: The next thing is the restaurants and the businesses on Salem Street.

1374
02:06:17,856 --> 02:06:30,358
[SPEAKER_81]: If we start to congest the area with parking, and again, I can't speak as a resident of that neighborhood, but I am going to speak as someone who frequents the area for restaurants.

1375
02:06:31,959 --> 02:06:32,959
[SPEAKER_81]: Where are we going to park?

1376
02:06:32,999 --> 02:06:34,379
[SPEAKER_81]: Are we going to have to walk there?

1377
02:06:34,399 --> 02:06:36,699
[SPEAKER_81]: Well, it's like a four-mile walk for me probably.

1378
02:06:38,460 --> 02:06:39,180
[SPEAKER_81]: How do we get there?

1379
02:06:39,200 --> 02:06:40,200
[SPEAKER_81]: Do we have to Uber it?

1380
02:06:42,058 --> 02:06:46,759
[SPEAKER_81]: What are we proposing for the businesses because now we may push them out.

1381
02:06:47,640 --> 02:06:56,963
[SPEAKER_81]: I know and I'm under the impression that when you're not going to have certain types of medical clinics that are going to

1382
02:06:58,943 --> 02:07:06,787
[SPEAKER_81]: affect the neighborhood as well, because as some people weren't concerned about it, I would be because they were young children in that neighborhood.

1383
02:07:06,967 --> 02:07:17,953
[SPEAKER_81]: And I walked Canal Street on my way to my office, I got off at Knott Station, and I walked Canal Street every day, morning, and then on the way back.

1384
02:07:19,577 --> 02:07:22,780
[SPEAKER_81]: And it was a sight, and a sight for sore eyes.

1385
02:07:23,480 --> 02:07:25,282
[SPEAKER_81]: Sadly, very sadly.

1386
02:07:25,982 --> 02:07:40,233
[SPEAKER_81]: But it's not something that I would want to live next door to, or live near, or would I ever want my children, or grandchildren especially, or any child to have to see that.

1387
02:07:41,341 --> 02:07:44,383
[SPEAKER_81]: and it's an urgent situation.

1388
02:07:44,863 --> 02:07:52,467
[SPEAKER_81]: I can't say I'm fully opposed to affordable housing and bringing housing in.

1389
02:07:52,507 --> 02:07:53,388
[SPEAKER_81]: No, of course not.

1390
02:07:53,908 --> 02:07:57,590
[SPEAKER_81]: But we have to really look at and you have Medford Square.

1391
02:07:58,891 --> 02:08:00,352
[SPEAKER_81]: Medford Square is amazing.

1392
02:08:00,612 --> 02:08:02,113
[SPEAKER_81]: Look at all the space you have there.

1393
02:08:02,713 --> 02:08:04,514
[SPEAKER_81]: Why aren't you looking at that as well?

1394
02:08:05,254 --> 02:08:05,534
[SPEAKER_81]: I'm sorry.

1395
02:08:05,574 --> 02:08:06,415
[SPEAKER_81]: Thank you very much.

1396
02:08:11,693 --> 02:08:12,133
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1397
02:08:12,153 --> 02:08:23,659
[SPEAKER_47]: And I do want to note that this is part of a citywide rezoning, we are looking at Medford Square and West Medford and every part of the city.

1398
02:08:23,859 --> 02:08:24,220
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1399
02:08:24,240 --> 02:08:27,681
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm going to go back to the podium name and address for the record, please.

1400
02:08:27,721 --> 02:08:28,662
[SPEAKER_47]: You have three minutes.

1401
02:08:30,370 --> 02:08:31,390
[SPEAKER_70]: Good evening, everyone.

1402
02:08:32,131 --> 02:08:33,471
[SPEAKER_70]: My name is Sharon Diesso.

1403
02:08:33,531 --> 02:08:35,912
[SPEAKER_70]: I'm a longtime resident of the city of Medford.

1404
02:08:36,772 --> 02:08:39,293
[SPEAKER_70]: And I have some comments to make.

1405
02:08:39,373 --> 02:08:42,054
[SPEAKER_70]: I'm at 130 Circuit in Mass Ave in Medford.

1406
02:08:43,134 --> 02:08:45,915
[SPEAKER_70]: I'd like to start by just telling a little story, too.

1407
02:08:46,035 --> 02:08:53,558
[SPEAKER_70]: I know it's a long night, and probably the council members anticipated it and said, boy, I really dread tonight.

1408
02:08:53,618 --> 02:08:55,259
[SPEAKER_70]: It's going to be one of those nights again.

1409
02:08:55,959 --> 02:08:59,200
[SPEAKER_70]: Some of you at home may have already shut it off and got into something.

1410
02:09:00,080 --> 02:09:24,412
[SPEAKER_70]: more interesting, but being a longtime member, and I'm probably older than about 75 to 80% of the people in this room, when I was a young girl, my mom and my grandmother who had come here after waiting three to four years of paper approvals, et cetera, much like Mr. Castagnetti's family,

1411
02:09:25,112 --> 02:09:34,164
[SPEAKER_70]: were very proud to come to Malden, and from there they wanted to upgrade and Medford was very lovely at that time at the Felsway.

1412
02:09:35,345 --> 02:09:40,351
[SPEAKER_70]: Some of you may remember, there was no stop and shop, there was no Felsway Plaza.

1413
02:09:41,773 --> 02:09:52,429
[SPEAKER_70]: The traffic island that you see now was a gorgeous tree ridden trolley route that went I believe from Stoneham all the way to Sullivan Square.

1414
02:09:53,851 --> 02:09:56,234
[SPEAKER_70]: We then moved over to the Lawrence Estates.

1415
02:09:56,955 --> 02:10:01,677
[SPEAKER_70]: So I'm going to give you one warning, some people are out there, you're much younger than I am.

1416
02:10:02,037 --> 02:10:04,838
[SPEAKER_70]: You don't have experience in seeing change.

1417
02:10:05,738 --> 02:10:08,619
[SPEAKER_70]: Does Salem Street need a perk and a facelift?

1418
02:10:08,759 --> 02:10:15,542
[SPEAKER_70]: Yes, I'm doing the same thing in the first floor of my home right now, just with simple painting and some different ideas.

1419
02:10:17,103 --> 02:10:20,404
[SPEAKER_70]: Look at the stop and shop, but when it came we dreaded it coming.

1420
02:10:21,925 --> 02:10:24,206
[SPEAKER_70]: If you do this in the wrong way.

1421
02:10:24,226 --> 02:10:34,490
[SPEAKER_70]: You're hearing children, they're not going to be here, they're going to be up and out of here and moving to the record or someplace because it's going to end up like a fells way.

1422
02:10:35,850 --> 02:10:37,452
[SPEAKER_70]: Not planned like Assembly Row.

1423
02:10:37,492 --> 02:10:38,533
[SPEAKER_70]: What's the big difference?

1424
02:10:39,314 --> 02:10:40,616
[SPEAKER_70]: Somerville had land.

1425
02:10:41,036 --> 02:10:43,359
[SPEAKER_70]: We don't have land, which is a disadvantage.

1426
02:10:43,820 --> 02:10:46,543
[SPEAKER_70]: Do some people deserve good affordable housing?

1427
02:10:46,783 --> 02:10:47,083
[SPEAKER_70]: Yes.

1428
02:10:47,544 --> 02:10:49,186
[SPEAKER_70]: It's not going to happen this way.

1429
02:10:49,346 --> 02:10:50,768
[SPEAKER_70]: I really truly believe that.

1430
02:10:51,608 --> 02:11:06,352
[SPEAKER_70]: I'm also interested in the commission or the company you hired to consult with this, how much it costs the taxpayers to bring that company, Mr. President, to the city, how much is that costing us?

1431
02:11:06,492 --> 02:11:07,733
[SPEAKER_70]: How much is that costing us?

1432
02:11:08,273 --> 02:11:08,973
[SPEAKER_47]: I'll answer when you're done.

1433
02:11:09,852 --> 02:11:10,172
[SPEAKER_70]: Okay.

1434
02:11:10,673 --> 02:11:14,476
[SPEAKER_70]: Um, also I just want to tell you that you're not going to get great supermarkets.

1435
02:11:14,496 --> 02:11:16,257
[SPEAKER_70]: You're going to get more convenience stores.

1436
02:11:16,617 --> 02:11:17,938
[SPEAKER_70]: You won't be sitting outside.

1437
02:11:18,278 --> 02:11:19,799
[SPEAKER_70]: There were three cafes there already.

1438
02:11:19,819 --> 02:11:24,243
[SPEAKER_70]: I haven't seen one chair, but I want to thank everyone who worked diligently.

1439
02:11:24,823 --> 02:11:31,128
[SPEAKER_70]: This needs to be done from the bottom up safety first play in the ambulance doesn't have to get through that.

1440
02:11:31,808 --> 02:11:33,129
[SPEAKER_70]: Um, it's going to be very sad.

1441
02:11:33,149 --> 02:11:34,310
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1442
02:11:40,156 --> 02:11:42,236
[SPEAKER_47]: And Councilor Collins can correct me if I'm wrong.

1443
02:11:42,777 --> 02:11:50,258
[SPEAKER_47]: I believe this is a $100,000 contract over 18 months for NS Associates.

1444
02:11:50,838 --> 02:11:51,758
[SPEAKER_47]: Go to the podium.

1445
02:11:52,038 --> 02:11:53,319
[SPEAKER_47]: Actually, I gotta go to Zoom, sorry.

1446
02:11:53,339 --> 02:11:59,740
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm gonna go to iPad who has hopefully emailed me that they are Pat Hanson.

1447
02:11:59,840 --> 02:12:00,780
[SPEAKER_47]: So thank you, Pat.

1448
02:12:01,340 --> 02:12:02,500
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm asking you to unmute.

1449
02:12:03,621 --> 02:12:05,041
[SPEAKER_47]: If you could click the unmute button.

1450
02:12:10,761 --> 02:12:13,143
[SPEAKER_47]: Pat Hanson, iPad on Zoom.

1451
02:12:18,287 --> 02:12:19,828
[SPEAKER_47]: All right, Pat, we'll come back to you.

1452
02:12:19,848 --> 02:12:21,969
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm gonna go to Janine Senkabaugh.

1453
02:12:22,089 --> 02:12:24,771
[SPEAKER_47]: Janine, name and address for the record, please.

1454
02:12:24,811 --> 02:12:26,693
[SPEAKER_47]: I've asked you to unmute and you'll have three minutes.

1455
02:12:28,922 --> 02:12:30,344
[SPEAKER_74]: Hi, my name is Janine Sensible.

1456
02:12:30,364 --> 02:12:35,269
[SPEAKER_74]: I live at 40 Fountain Street, and I'm a extremely longtime resident.

1457
02:12:35,369 --> 02:12:36,350
[SPEAKER_74]: I've lived here all my life.

1458
02:12:36,851 --> 02:12:38,693
[SPEAKER_74]: I live pretty close to Salem Street.

1459
02:12:39,473 --> 02:12:44,719
[SPEAKER_74]: And honestly, all the people that oppose this, I feel strongly that I would say the same thing.

1460
02:12:46,060 --> 02:12:50,502
[SPEAKER_74]: I do also feel we need change, and I think zoning is a good start.

1461
02:12:51,343 --> 02:12:54,284
[SPEAKER_74]: But to be honest with you, this is not a walkable city.

1462
02:12:54,924 --> 02:12:58,106
[SPEAKER_74]: You can't walk anywhere from my home and feel safe.

1463
02:12:58,646 --> 02:13:00,987
[SPEAKER_74]: There are no crosswalks that you feel safe in.

1464
02:13:01,488 --> 02:13:05,309
[SPEAKER_74]: The traffic, the speed of the cars is just insane.

1465
02:13:05,329 --> 02:13:08,991
[SPEAKER_74]: I had a neighbor who lived on Fountain Street who died at that rotary.

1466
02:13:09,351 --> 02:13:12,373
[SPEAKER_74]: We just had another death recently in the past few months.

1467
02:13:13,093 --> 02:13:18,115
[SPEAKER_74]: Honestly, these are the things that you should be focusing on to protect your residents.

1468
02:13:18,595 --> 02:13:20,415
[SPEAKER_74]: I realize housing is a shortage.

1469
02:13:21,536 --> 02:13:28,138
[SPEAKER_74]: But honestly, this isn't the right way to go about it, packing more people in and pretending like they're never going to have a car.

1470
02:13:28,673 --> 02:13:31,834
[SPEAKER_74]: and you're never going to need to have parking, you're in La La Land.

1471
02:13:32,515 --> 02:13:33,995
[SPEAKER_74]: That's not even feasible.

1472
02:13:34,055 --> 02:13:35,196
[SPEAKER_74]: That's not even possible.

1473
02:13:35,696 --> 02:13:43,760
[SPEAKER_74]: Everyone has cars for all their needs, and you can't build and put that many people in a condensed, already dense area

1474
02:13:44,220 --> 02:13:49,202
[SPEAKER_74]: and not expect them to have cars, and they will overflow into the neighborhoods that we have.

1475
02:13:49,682 --> 02:13:56,925
[SPEAKER_74]: And we are a neighborhood, especially those of us that have been there for a long time, and even the newcomers that have come on board as well.

1476
02:13:57,526 --> 02:13:59,106
[SPEAKER_74]: People want a neighborhood.

1477
02:13:59,627 --> 02:14:07,010
[SPEAKER_74]: We don't want six-story buildings with no parking, with tens of thousands of people,

1478
02:14:07,889 --> 02:14:11,731
[SPEAKER_74]: in an area that is too dense as it is.

1479
02:14:12,612 --> 02:14:20,016
[SPEAKER_74]: And it's just extremely upsetting that safety, walkability and safety aren't hand in hand.

1480
02:14:20,636 --> 02:14:27,140
[SPEAKER_74]: And we're more concerned about making sure about things that aren't a priority for the majority of us.

1481
02:14:28,120 --> 02:14:30,862
[SPEAKER_74]: Granted, I have a home, I'm lucky to have a home.

1482
02:14:32,043 --> 02:14:39,950
[SPEAKER_74]: And I'm sorry that it's unaffordable, but please don't ruin it for the rest of us so that we won't be able to go anywhere or do anything.

1483
02:14:40,471 --> 02:14:41,552
[SPEAKER_74]: We don't need housing.

1484
02:14:42,012 --> 02:14:43,073
[SPEAKER_74]: We need restaurants.

1485
02:14:43,393 --> 02:14:53,543
[SPEAKER_74]: We need things to go to because the majority of us go to other towns and cities to go to their restaurants because they either have parking or they have more choices.

1486
02:14:54,659 --> 02:15:00,946
[SPEAKER_74]: And I just strongly feel that this is something that should happen, but you need to put more thought into it.

1487
02:15:01,006 --> 02:15:05,331
[SPEAKER_74]: And you need to care about your residents that live here and protect us.

1488
02:15:06,892 --> 02:15:07,593
[SPEAKER_74]: And I'm all set.

1489
02:15:07,693 --> 02:15:08,074
[SPEAKER_74]: Thank you.

1490
02:15:08,975 --> 02:15:09,595
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1491
02:15:09,615 --> 02:15:11,417
[SPEAKER_47]: And I just wanted...

1492
02:15:16,338 --> 02:15:21,983
[SPEAKER_47]: Just wanted to note that we had a meeting at six o'clock today, specifically on the traffic and safety issue.

1493
02:15:22,043 --> 02:15:36,955
[SPEAKER_47]: We focused on the Salem Street Rotary, and we received an update from our traffic and transportation director, as well as I read out an update from MassDOT about their plans for construction this season to address safety concerns at the Salem Street Rotary.

1494
02:15:37,075 --> 02:15:43,260
[SPEAKER_47]: So you can go back and watch that on YouTube right now, or on Medford Community Media in a day or two.

1495
02:15:43,920 --> 02:15:46,063
[SPEAKER_47]: Go to the podium, name and address for the record, please.

1496
02:15:46,083 --> 02:15:48,606
[SPEAKER_47]: You have three minutes and then we'll come back to you, Pat Hanson.

1497
02:15:49,387 --> 02:15:50,488
[SPEAKER_67]: My name is Paul Morgan.

1498
02:15:50,528 --> 02:15:51,629
[SPEAKER_67]: I live on Brewster Road.

1499
02:15:51,649 --> 02:15:57,076
[SPEAKER_67]: I want to go on record as being opposed to the Salem Street zoning changes as they are now.

1500
02:15:57,637 --> 02:16:02,022
[SPEAKER_67]: The area is already congested and this will just make it much worse.

1501
02:16:02,468 --> 02:16:05,950
[SPEAKER_67]: But for the people that live there, it means that their life is going to be more difficult.

1502
02:16:06,490 --> 02:16:09,892
[SPEAKER_67]: I've been in this city for over 62 years.

1503
02:16:10,752 --> 02:16:14,134
[SPEAKER_67]: And so I've seen the housing prices change.

1504
02:16:14,635 --> 02:16:18,016
[SPEAKER_67]: Most of these people that have these houses now bought them when they could afford them.

1505
02:16:18,257 --> 02:16:21,418
[SPEAKER_67]: They're going to be forced out financially somehow.

1506
02:16:22,919 --> 02:16:24,640
[SPEAKER_67]: And it's not going to be good.

1507
02:16:24,680 --> 02:16:30,063
[SPEAKER_67]: They're going to end up paying more for a condo fee somewhere else, not in Medford, outside where they could park.

1508
02:16:31,124 --> 02:16:34,747
[SPEAKER_67]: you know, and it's probably gonna cost them as much as their mortgage.

1509
02:16:35,147 --> 02:16:41,391
[SPEAKER_67]: So they don't deserve to be thrown out of their neighborhoods, which is what's gonna happen, I'm afraid, if this thing goes through.

1510
02:16:41,932 --> 02:16:44,274
[SPEAKER_67]: Not to everybody all at once, but one at a time.

1511
02:16:45,034 --> 02:16:45,795
[SPEAKER_67]: Thank you very much.

1512
02:16:47,356 --> 02:16:47,856
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1513
02:16:47,876 --> 02:16:50,958
[SPEAKER_47]: We're gonna go back to Zoom.

1514
02:16:51,199 --> 02:16:52,580
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm gonna go to Pat Hanson.

1515
02:16:52,660 --> 02:16:54,101
[SPEAKER_47]: Pat, you have three minutes.

1516
02:16:54,161 --> 02:16:55,622
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record, please.

1517
02:16:56,539 --> 02:16:57,220
[SPEAKER_71]: Thank you so much.

1518
02:16:58,561 --> 02:17:01,363
[SPEAKER_71]: My name is Mitchell.

1519
02:17:01,543 --> 02:17:03,745
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes, if you can just shut off your other device.

1520
02:17:04,105 --> 02:17:04,525
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1521
02:17:06,887 --> 02:17:13,813
[SPEAKER_47]: Oh, yeah, you're gonna you're gonna need to mute your other computer or TV.

1522
02:17:13,833 --> 02:17:17,076
[SPEAKER_71]: All right.

1523
02:17:17,156 --> 02:17:17,716
[SPEAKER_71]: Is that better?

1524
02:17:19,358 --> 02:17:19,618
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes.

1525
02:17:20,370 --> 02:17:20,970
[SPEAKER_71]: Thank you so much.

1526
02:17:21,611 --> 02:17:24,493
[SPEAKER_71]: So thank you so much for allowing me to speak.

1527
02:17:24,573 --> 02:17:25,934
[SPEAKER_47]: Sorry, the echo is still there.

1528
02:17:26,034 --> 02:17:27,215
[SPEAKER_47]: I may have spoken too soon.

1529
02:17:30,997 --> 02:17:36,041
[SPEAKER_47]: If you have another computer or a TV that's putting out sound, that's the issue.

1530
02:17:36,061 --> 02:17:38,703
[SPEAKER_71]: Sorry, I hope that helps.

1531
02:17:38,723 --> 02:17:41,825
[SPEAKER_47]: Is that clear?

1532
02:17:41,845 --> 02:17:42,465
[SPEAKER_47]: That sounds good.

1533
02:17:42,505 --> 02:17:43,766
[SPEAKER_47]: I'll give you three minutes starting now.

1534
02:17:43,866 --> 02:17:45,007
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record, please.

1535
02:17:45,473 --> 02:17:46,033
[SPEAKER_71]: Thank you so much.

1536
02:17:46,053 --> 02:17:47,114
[SPEAKER_71]: My name is Pat Hanson.

1537
02:17:47,154 --> 02:17:48,856
[SPEAKER_71]: I live at 22 Toro Avenue.

1538
02:17:48,876 --> 02:17:52,979
[SPEAKER_71]: I'm on the other side of Medford, but I've lived here almost four decades.

1539
02:17:53,920 --> 02:17:57,543
[SPEAKER_71]: And I have many friends that live in that area and I feel bad for them.

1540
02:17:59,825 --> 02:18:09,212
[SPEAKER_71]: So as I support them in the opposition to this proposal as it is right now, that it wasn't done properly,

1541
02:18:10,860 --> 02:18:19,926
[SPEAKER_71]: So could you please consider putting a hold on this and put it in writing to help support them?

1542
02:18:25,330 --> 02:18:25,810
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1543
02:18:26,731 --> 02:18:30,554
[SPEAKER_47]: Councilors will speak once the public comment period has concluded.

1544
02:18:31,274 --> 02:18:33,035
[SPEAKER_47]: You have two minutes if you'd like to say anything else.

1545
02:18:34,076 --> 02:18:34,596
[SPEAKER_71]: No, that's great.

1546
02:18:34,636 --> 02:18:35,237
[SPEAKER_71]: Thank you so much.

1547
02:18:36,169 --> 02:18:40,351
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you, and I appreciate your working with me to make sure you can speak.

1548
02:18:40,451 --> 02:18:40,831
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1549
02:18:40,851 --> 02:18:44,552
[SPEAKER_47]: All right, I'm going to go back to the podium.

1550
02:18:44,752 --> 02:18:45,833
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record, please.

1551
02:18:45,853 --> 02:18:46,513
[SPEAKER_47]: You have three minutes.

1552
02:18:48,534 --> 02:18:53,376
[SPEAKER_37]: David McKenna to Vine Street, which is right next to Salem Street.

1553
02:18:54,516 --> 02:19:01,139
[SPEAKER_37]: I believe this new zoning is a win-win-win for walkability, for the city budget, and for addressing the housing crisis.

1554
02:19:02,258 --> 02:19:08,541
[SPEAKER_37]: The new zoning will allow commercial to be built on most of Salem Street, where it is not currently allowed.

1555
02:19:09,422 --> 02:19:12,703
[SPEAKER_37]: Businesses are grandfathered in, but new businesses have difficulty coming in.

1556
02:19:13,564 --> 02:19:21,648
[SPEAKER_37]: The zoning will allow housing to be built on top of commercial, which is not currently allowed, which improves walkability.

1557
02:19:22,248 --> 02:19:29,691
[SPEAKER_37]: One of the reasons why the neighborhood is currently walkable is because there are so many grandfathered in, like Eddie's Pizza, with the apartments on top.

1558
02:19:34,867 --> 02:19:41,510
[SPEAKER_37]: The zoning will expand housing options because it's currently way too hard for families to stay in Medford when they're looking for an apartment.

1559
02:19:41,910 --> 02:19:43,690
[SPEAKER_37]: Many of my friends are struggling to find an apartment.

1560
02:19:44,391 --> 02:19:49,132
[SPEAKER_37]: Like some of the earlier speakers, my wife and I bought, you know, about a decade ago.

1561
02:19:49,192 --> 02:19:52,294
[SPEAKER_37]: And so before the prices went just totally out of control.

1562
02:19:53,814 --> 02:19:58,436
[SPEAKER_37]: New growth will expand the tax revenue for the city budget to improve public services for everybody.

1563
02:19:59,552 --> 02:20:12,506
[SPEAKER_37]: The reason that Cambridge and Somerville have some of the highest paid teachers, the highest paid public servants, excellent pre-K, despite never doing a tax override is because they have robust new development.

1564
02:20:12,546 --> 02:20:20,055
[SPEAKER_37]: And so this is an opportunity throughout the city for us to not need to raise taxes while bringing in new tax revenue.

1565
02:20:21,594 --> 02:20:27,557
[SPEAKER_37]: This zoning also fits perfectly with the MBTA's plan to triple the service levels on the 101 bus, renaming it the 96.

1566
02:20:28,338 --> 02:20:36,802
[SPEAKER_37]: And for the first time, the Salem Street Corridor will be connected by a very frequent bus to the Orange Line, Green Line, and Red Line.

1567
02:20:37,323 --> 02:20:41,545
[SPEAKER_37]: So that's a huge improvement that aligns with the zoning proposal.

1568
02:20:42,628 --> 02:20:54,979
[SPEAKER_37]: New development will not overburden our infrastructure because developers pay traffic impact fees, sewer and water impact fees, public safety impact fees, to make sure that they are contributing when they come to Medford.

1569
02:20:56,020 --> 02:20:57,481
[SPEAKER_37]: In addition to the new tax revenue.

1570
02:20:59,930 --> 02:21:10,159
[SPEAKER_37]: The plan also has thoughtful incentives where developers can only go up to three or four stories unless they provide extra community benefits, including improving our streets, sidewalks and crosswalks.

1571
02:21:10,799 --> 02:21:16,604
[SPEAKER_37]: So yes, those do need improvement for pedestrian safety, but that is in this plan.

1572
02:21:18,105 --> 02:21:22,309
[SPEAKER_37]: Extra affordable housing, extra green space, public green space.

1573
02:21:22,329 --> 02:21:22,749
[SPEAKER_37]: 30 seconds.

1574
02:21:25,085 --> 02:21:26,506
[SPEAKER_37]: Don't believe the misinformation.

1575
02:21:27,727 --> 02:21:36,333
[SPEAKER_37]: The city staff has repeatedly corrected commenters who say there's no studies because the studies are paid for by developers whenever they propose a project.

1576
02:21:36,914 --> 02:21:41,177
[SPEAKER_37]: Site plan review requires the fire department to review and approve all of the designs.

1577
02:21:41,337 --> 02:21:45,860
[SPEAKER_37]: So that is in the current regulations.

1578
02:21:46,641 --> 02:21:49,643
[SPEAKER_37]: And I encourage you to please pass this.

1579
02:21:51,460 --> 02:21:51,960
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1580
02:21:51,980 --> 02:21:53,981
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm gonna go back to Zoom.

1581
02:21:54,202 --> 02:21:57,443
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm going to go to Teresa Marzilli on Zoom.

1582
02:21:57,503 --> 02:21:59,445
[SPEAKER_47]: Teresa, name and address for the record, please.

1583
02:21:59,485 --> 02:22:00,385
[SPEAKER_47]: You'll have three minutes.

1584
02:22:06,048 --> 02:22:08,390
[SPEAKER_45]: Thank you, Mr. President, for noticing me.

1585
02:22:08,650 --> 02:22:09,771
[SPEAKER_45]: My name is Teresa.

1586
02:22:09,811 --> 02:22:15,494
[SPEAKER_45]: I live at 48 Medford Street, and I just wanna speak briefly in support

1587
02:22:16,440 --> 02:22:17,301
[SPEAKER_45]: of the plan.

1588
02:22:17,321 --> 02:22:21,704
[SPEAKER_45]: I just want to note that, you know, I really love Medford.

1589
02:22:21,724 --> 02:22:27,387
[SPEAKER_45]: It's been a wonderful home for my wife and I. There's really nowhere else in Massachusetts I'd rather live.

1590
02:22:27,407 --> 02:22:36,854
[SPEAKER_45]: I know that change is emotional and that right now there's a lot of uncertainty about the future generally, but I just see this as a value add to the entire city.

1591
02:22:38,208 --> 02:22:45,414
[SPEAKER_45]: And I also want to note that Salem Street zoning is part of a, it's a puzzle piece and a larger matrix.

1592
02:22:46,135 --> 02:22:51,059
[SPEAKER_45]: All of the city will be rezoned and I welcome the rezoning of the entire city.

1593
02:22:51,079 --> 02:22:55,303
[SPEAKER_45]: I think changes are necessary to ensure that people can age in place.

1594
02:22:56,384 --> 02:23:01,128
[SPEAKER_45]: As previous commenters have said, they want their adult children to move back.

1595
02:23:01,688 --> 02:23:08,525
[SPEAKER_45]: We want teachers and city staff and police officers to be able to stay in Medford and live in the place that they serve.

1596
02:23:09,551 --> 02:23:21,743
[SPEAKER_45]: Um, I know that people are concerned about the project review, but as it's already been noted, every time a project comes up, there is a review on a project by process basis.

1597
02:23:22,504 --> 02:23:29,010
[SPEAKER_45]: Um, this is in current regulations about development and also development doesn't happen all at once.

1598
02:23:29,030 --> 02:23:33,735
[SPEAKER_45]: Um, there are going to be many opportunities that we will have as a community to shape.

1599
02:23:34,421 --> 02:23:37,502
[SPEAKER_45]: the future of what Medford gets to be.

1600
02:23:38,042 --> 02:23:44,443
[SPEAKER_45]: And I hope that we will continue to do that together, um, as, as neighbors and as a collective.

1601
02:23:44,523 --> 02:23:51,565
[SPEAKER_45]: And thank you to those who have also lent their voice tonight and definitely thank you to city council for taking up this issue.

1602
02:23:51,625 --> 02:23:52,605
[SPEAKER_45]: It's really important.

1603
02:23:52,685 --> 02:24:02,007
[SPEAKER_45]: And yeah, I'd really just love to see Medford being a part of the solution, um, to a, both state and really nationwide housing crisis.

1604
02:24:02,147 --> 02:24:02,467
[SPEAKER_45]: Thank you.

1605
02:24:04,064 --> 02:24:04,524
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1606
02:24:04,545 --> 02:24:10,130
[SPEAKER_47]: You go to the podium name and address the record please you have three minutes.

1607
02:24:10,150 --> 02:24:13,554
[SPEAKER_54]: Hi, Melanie Trangali 116 Forest Street.

1608
02:24:14,535 --> 02:24:21,823
[SPEAKER_54]: I also own a piece of property at the corner of Park and Salem Street, and I do want to say that I'm in favor of rezoning especially

1609
02:24:23,668 --> 02:24:26,869
[SPEAKER_54]: anything that increases our businesses and commercial businesses.

1610
02:24:26,949 --> 02:24:32,890
[SPEAKER_54]: However, at this current zoning, I'm not in favor of right now for a number of reasons.

1611
02:24:33,670 --> 02:24:42,232
[SPEAKER_54]: One, just looking at the website, one of the goals that says moderately increase residential housing and ensure neighborhood compatibility.

1612
02:24:42,873 --> 02:24:48,054
[SPEAKER_54]: Under the current zoning, I don't think the increase in residential housing is moderate.

1613
02:24:48,114 --> 02:24:50,434
[SPEAKER_54]: I think it's much larger than moderate.

1614
02:24:50,454 --> 02:24:53,215
[SPEAKER_54]: We could be talking about possibly thousands of houses and units.

1615
02:24:54,356 --> 02:24:57,038
[SPEAKER_54]: In top of that, none of these houses and units are affordable.

1616
02:24:57,779 --> 02:25:02,263
[SPEAKER_54]: There's nothing saying that they're affordable, that it's going to reduce the cost of living in Medford.

1617
02:25:02,624 --> 02:25:10,091
[SPEAKER_54]: There are currently 489 apartments listed on Zillow right now in Medford, and that has not brought down the price at all.

1618
02:25:12,053 --> 02:25:13,134
[SPEAKER_54]: Parking is an issue.

1619
02:25:13,674 --> 02:25:16,397
[SPEAKER_54]: As I stated, I do have a piece of property on Park and Salem Street.

1620
02:25:16,477 --> 02:25:17,117
[SPEAKER_54]: I have tenants.

1621
02:25:17,318 --> 02:25:18,078
[SPEAKER_54]: They all have cars.

1622
02:25:18,799 --> 02:25:19,699
[SPEAKER_54]: They all need parking.

1623
02:25:20,039 --> 02:25:21,520
[SPEAKER_54]: They all drive to their jobs.

1624
02:25:21,920 --> 02:25:25,301
[SPEAKER_54]: They don't take the 101 bus or walk around in Salem Street.

1625
02:25:25,361 --> 02:25:26,861
[SPEAKER_54]: They drive to other destinations.

1626
02:25:28,161 --> 02:25:35,703
[SPEAKER_54]: Two, I think that I'm concerned of the businesses and gentrification of these buildings.

1627
02:25:35,963 --> 02:25:39,624
[SPEAKER_54]: All these businesses, the majority of them do not own the buildings that they're renting.

1628
02:25:40,164 --> 02:25:40,984
[SPEAKER_54]: Rents could increase.

1629
02:25:41,244 --> 02:25:42,144
[SPEAKER_54]: And we saw that.

1630
02:25:42,184 --> 02:25:43,965
[SPEAKER_54]: We saw that with the Best Sellers Cafe.

1631
02:25:44,565 --> 02:25:48,586
[SPEAKER_54]: It was displaced for years and years, came in, and then couldn't afford the rent to stay there anymore.

1632
02:25:49,126 --> 02:25:52,948
[SPEAKER_54]: So there's a very good chance that a lot of these local businesses will be out of business.

1633
02:25:54,889 --> 02:25:56,670
[SPEAKER_54]: And again, just we need to consider parking.

1634
02:25:57,350 --> 02:26:00,651
[SPEAKER_54]: If you're gonna have businesses, you need to have places to park.

1635
02:26:01,092 --> 02:26:01,652
[SPEAKER_54]: So that's it.

1636
02:26:01,852 --> 02:26:02,512
[SPEAKER_54]: Thank you very much.

1637
02:26:03,232 --> 02:26:03,673
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1638
02:26:03,693 --> 02:26:06,594
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm gonna go to Zoom, Jessica Parks.

1639
02:26:07,054 --> 02:26:09,235
[SPEAKER_47]: Jessica, name and address for the record, please.

1640
02:26:09,255 --> 02:26:11,016
[SPEAKER_47]: And you'll have three minutes.

1641
02:26:13,457 --> 02:26:14,397
[SPEAKER_82]: Jessica Parks, 38 Corey Street.

1642
02:26:16,699 --> 02:26:25,145
[SPEAKER_82]: I just want to thank you all for doing this and for also working so hard to take into consideration all of the feedback you've received to date.

1643
02:26:26,266 --> 02:26:41,517
[SPEAKER_82]: During the override campaign, there was a recognition from both proponents and opponents of the override that the override was a stopgap for immediate needs, but the city ultimately needed to focus on new growth to thrive.

1644
02:26:42,408 --> 02:26:57,035
[SPEAKER_82]: The citywide zoning plan is a critical first step in doing this to bring in higher density and mixed use development that in a way that is responsible and not done in a haphazard or ad hoc way.

1645
02:26:57,355 --> 02:27:06,440
[SPEAKER_82]: And I think that just the back and forth that has occurred to date really shows that we need to

1646
02:27:06,756 --> 02:27:12,317
[SPEAKER_82]: the city is taking this seriously and trying to listen to the concerns of residents.

1647
02:27:13,298 --> 02:27:31,082
[SPEAKER_82]: Obviously not everyone is going to be 100% happy, but I think that in order for us to bring in the much needed development for a stronger financial base for the city, we do need to bring in development and make it easier for developers to do such.

1648
02:27:31,102 --> 02:27:31,902
[SPEAKER_82]: Thank you.

1649
02:27:34,123 --> 02:27:34,543
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1650
02:27:35,534 --> 02:27:36,595
[SPEAKER_47]: Go back to the podium.

1651
02:27:38,516 --> 02:27:41,057
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record please you have three minutes.

1652
02:27:41,517 --> 02:27:58,407
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, my name is Eileen learner and I live at 3920 mystic Valley Parkway, and I'm here to speak strongly in favor of this zoning proposal, and to thank the city Councilors who worked on this and everybody who worked on this for their fine work.

1653
02:28:00,088 --> 02:28:15,340
[SPEAKER_14]: I was dismayed to hear some of the opponents stating that they think that having more affordable housing and increasing the population of our city is going to undermine the quality of life.

1654
02:28:15,701 --> 02:28:26,430
[SPEAKER_14]: I feel just the opposite, that we will be increasing the quality of life to bring more people in, more viable businesses, and also

1655
02:28:27,478 --> 02:28:29,979
[SPEAKER_14]: it will represent more money in the budget.

1656
02:28:30,199 --> 02:28:38,362
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, people want to have more money in the budget, but it seems like when there are proposals that will increase the budget, they're against them.

1657
02:28:40,862 --> 02:28:46,484
[SPEAKER_14]: And I've also noticed that most of the people who are in opposition are older people.

1658
02:28:47,104 --> 02:28:50,766
[SPEAKER_14]: And a lot of the people who have spoken favor are younger people.

1659
02:28:52,937 --> 02:28:57,260
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wanna say, I'm an older person, but I feel we have to make way for the young.

1660
02:28:57,320 --> 02:29:00,703
[SPEAKER_14]: We have to have places for them to live that they can afford.

1661
02:29:01,644 --> 02:29:09,370
[SPEAKER_14]: And yeah, I am worried about developers who develop luxury housing.

1662
02:29:09,450 --> 02:29:17,676
[SPEAKER_14]: And I do hope that the city council will really make sure that we do have affordable housing and not more luxury housing.

1663
02:29:18,476 --> 02:29:20,358
[SPEAKER_14]: But again, I thank you all for your work.

1664
02:29:22,528 --> 02:29:23,029
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1665
02:29:23,049 --> 02:29:30,095
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm going to go to Gary Marinelli on Zoom.

1666
02:29:30,175 --> 02:29:32,077
[SPEAKER_47]: Gary, name and address for the record, please.

1667
02:29:32,097 --> 02:29:32,977
[SPEAKER_47]: You have three minutes.

1668
02:29:40,104 --> 02:29:40,484
[SPEAKER_47]: Gary?

1669
02:29:44,508 --> 02:29:46,489
[SPEAKER_47]: Gary, you're unmuted, but we can't hear you.

1670
02:29:46,509 --> 02:29:48,111
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm going to try to ask you to unmute again.

1671
02:29:53,430 --> 02:29:55,430
[SPEAKER_47]: Gary, if you could speak now, you are unmuted.

1672
02:29:55,450 --> 02:30:03,292
[SPEAKER_47]: All right, Gary, it seems like you're having a technical issue, so we'll come back to you.

1673
02:30:03,312 --> 02:30:06,313
[SPEAKER_47]: I will go to Jessica Healy on Zoom.

1674
02:30:06,353 --> 02:30:07,713
[SPEAKER_47]: Jessica, name and address for the record.

1675
02:30:07,733 --> 02:30:08,474
[SPEAKER_47]: You have three minutes.

1676
02:30:12,955 --> 02:30:19,076
[SPEAKER_64]: I just have, hello, can you hear me?

1677
02:30:19,156 --> 02:30:20,536
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record, please.

1678
02:30:25,558 --> 02:30:30,699
[SPEAKER_64]: So we're saying affordable housing, is this gonna be affordable housing or low income housing?

1679
02:30:32,319 --> 02:30:34,680
[SPEAKER_64]: And who's saying that it's gonna be affordable?

1680
02:30:34,700 --> 02:30:42,061
[SPEAKER_64]: Because they just- If you could just finish your comment.

1681
02:30:42,081 --> 02:30:44,001
[SPEAKER_64]: Sorry, they just did in West Med.

1682
02:30:45,081 --> 02:30:45,361
[SPEAKER_64]: Okay.

1683
02:30:46,522 --> 02:30:51,703
[SPEAKER_64]: The building they just put up in West Medford is nine luxury apartments.

1684
02:30:52,543 --> 02:30:54,183
[SPEAKER_64]: Obviously those are not affordable.

1685
02:30:55,128 --> 02:30:56,969
[SPEAKER_64]: for your everyday person.

1686
02:30:57,029 --> 02:31:09,996
[SPEAKER_64]: So I'm just concerned that the ones that they're going to build on Salem Street is not going to be affordable for your everyday average person and they're going to build the luxury condos.

1687
02:31:11,236 --> 02:31:17,840
[SPEAKER_64]: Also, I'm definitely not in favor of it due to the part of the people in the area aren't in favor of it.

1688
02:31:18,780 --> 02:31:23,182
[SPEAKER_64]: So I'm definitely supporting how they feel because it is their neighborhood.

1689
02:31:23,883 --> 02:31:24,263
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you.

1690
02:31:25,838 --> 02:31:28,847
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1691
02:31:28,907 --> 02:31:31,675
[SPEAKER_47]: Go to the podium, name and address for the record.

1692
02:31:31,695 --> 02:31:32,317
[SPEAKER_47]: You have three minutes.

1693
02:31:37,183 --> 02:31:37,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1694
02:31:37,603 --> 02:31:37,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

1695
02:31:38,403 --> 02:31:40,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Roberta Cameron, 12 North Street.

1696
02:31:41,524 --> 02:31:47,405
[SPEAKER_03]: And I am coming here to wholeheartedly support a citywide zoning effort.

1697
02:31:47,465 --> 02:31:59,427
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that we need to incrementally increase the density and create opportunities for new investment in all of our neighborhoods throughout the city.

1698
02:31:59,887 --> 02:32:05,908
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hope that Salem Street is not going to be left behind the rest of the city in creating

1699
02:32:06,628 --> 02:32:14,815
[SPEAKER_03]: better opportunities for people to use their own properties to meet their own needs, which is what rezoning is going to do.

1700
02:32:15,735 --> 02:32:28,586
[SPEAKER_03]: And I also wanted to note that Medford's neighborhoods are fairly small and fairly similar so that most of us live in neighborhoods that look very much like the Salem Street neighborhood and

1701
02:32:30,367 --> 02:32:34,268
[SPEAKER_03]: What happens in one neighborhood affects all of us.

1702
02:32:34,368 --> 02:32:36,349
[SPEAKER_03]: We all live in the same Medford.

1703
02:32:37,009 --> 02:32:38,129
[SPEAKER_03]: I do my shopping.

1704
02:32:38,189 --> 02:32:39,129
[SPEAKER_03]: I go to restaurants.

1705
02:32:39,189 --> 02:32:40,990
[SPEAKER_03]: I go to the gym on Salem Street.

1706
02:32:41,210 --> 02:32:44,091
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's part of my neighborhood, too.

1707
02:32:44,671 --> 02:32:58,615
[SPEAKER_03]: So all of Medford is going to benefit from investment in new buildings, new housing, and higher quality public spaces on Salem Street and the other corridors, of which I live along one of the other corridors.

1708
02:32:59,235 --> 02:33:05,863
[SPEAKER_03]: So the proposed rules are going to give, as I mentioned, better choices for what to do with what people can do with their properties.

1709
02:33:06,283 --> 02:33:11,909
[SPEAKER_03]: But I also wanted to mention one other thing about how this is going to improve affordable housing.

1710
02:33:12,230 --> 02:33:17,035
[SPEAKER_03]: I recently heard an analogy given by a colleague who is talking about

1711
02:33:17,976 --> 02:33:24,525
[SPEAKER_03]: How housing development in general is going to improve housing affordability, it's kind of like cars.

1712
02:33:25,206 --> 02:33:28,992
[SPEAKER_03]: If used cars are always cheaper than new cars.

1713
02:33:29,933 --> 02:33:32,236
[SPEAKER_03]: If we stop making new cars.

1714
02:33:33,037 --> 02:33:43,782
[SPEAKER_03]: then used cars are going to become a rare commodity and they're going to go up in value so that you won't be able to afford to buy a used car and new cars don't exist.

1715
02:33:43,802 --> 02:33:47,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's the situation that's happening in Massachusetts today and in Medford.

1716
02:33:48,123 --> 02:33:50,164
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not creating new homes.

1717
02:33:50,745 --> 02:33:56,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Thus, our old homes are becoming unaffordable because they're such a rare commodity.

1718
02:33:56,767 --> 02:34:07,429
[SPEAKER_03]: So it will help to make housing more affordable if we do our part in Medford to make what this is a modest increase.

1719
02:34:07,729 --> 02:34:08,149
[SPEAKER_03]: 30 seconds.

1720
02:34:08,269 --> 02:34:08,569
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1721
02:34:08,589 --> 02:34:09,650
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I have to say.

1722
02:34:09,710 --> 02:34:10,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

1723
02:34:10,670 --> 02:34:11,150
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1724
02:34:11,170 --> 02:34:16,311
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm gonna go back to Zoom.

1725
02:34:16,451 --> 02:34:18,711
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm gonna try Gary again, Gary Marinelli.

1726
02:34:19,392 --> 02:34:21,412
[SPEAKER_47]: Gary, I'm gonna ask you to unmute and we'll try again.

1727
02:34:21,432 --> 02:34:25,933
[SPEAKER_47]: If you say something into your microphone,

1728
02:34:28,904 --> 02:34:31,705
[SPEAKER_47]: Sorry, Gary, for some reason your microphone's not working.

1729
02:34:32,446 --> 02:34:33,186
[SPEAKER_47]: I apologize.

1730
02:34:33,866 --> 02:34:37,948
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm gonna go to Eunice, Eunice Brown on Zoom.

1731
02:34:38,008 --> 02:34:39,909
[SPEAKER_47]: Eunice, name and address for the record, please.

1732
02:34:39,929 --> 02:34:40,790
[SPEAKER_47]: You have three minutes.

1733
02:34:42,878 --> 02:34:43,799
[SPEAKER_79]: Hi, thanks very much.

1734
02:34:44,139 --> 02:34:45,880
[SPEAKER_79]: Eunice Brown, Greenleaf Avenue.

1735
02:34:45,900 --> 02:34:52,984
[SPEAKER_79]: I'd like to go on record as being opposed to this zoning project.

1736
02:34:54,204 --> 02:35:02,449
[SPEAKER_79]: It's very hard to support something that the actual local people that live there are opposed to.

1737
02:35:02,469 --> 02:35:07,592
[SPEAKER_79]: And I'm opposed to it for all the various reasons that have been brought about already.

1738
02:35:07,672 --> 02:35:09,293
[SPEAKER_79]: It hasn't been properly studied.

1739
02:35:09,873 --> 02:35:20,776
[SPEAKER_79]: the possibility of horrendous traffic that's worse than what's there now, the fact that people are indeed going to bring cars.

1740
02:35:21,356 --> 02:35:25,217
[SPEAKER_79]: And if there's not parking for them, where are they going to go?

1741
02:35:25,797 --> 02:35:38,281
[SPEAKER_79]: And particularly when you have a elementary school in that area where that requires parking as well, both during school hours and for afternoon and evening events,

1742
02:35:39,182 --> 02:35:40,983
[SPEAKER_79]: concerning the students there.

1743
02:35:41,844 --> 02:35:57,672
[SPEAKER_79]: But one thing that I want to point out, and I've sat here now for the last couple of hours and I've made a list of everybody who is in favor and everybody who is opposed, and I've noted their address.

1744
02:35:58,313 --> 02:36:07,578
[SPEAKER_79]: Of all of the people that are in favor of it, all but less than a third do not live in the area.

1745
02:36:08,703 --> 02:36:13,926
[SPEAKER_79]: of those opposed, all but a couple, don't live in the area.

1746
02:36:14,307 --> 02:36:23,773
[SPEAKER_79]: So it's very hard to support something that the people that live clear across the city seem to be in favor of.

1747
02:36:24,593 --> 02:36:32,138
[SPEAKER_79]: And I don't understand why you're not listening to the people living directly in the area far more closely.

1748
02:36:32,158 --> 02:36:37,842
[SPEAKER_79]: And as I look at the rest of the parade of people at the podium, in line for the podium,

1749
02:36:38,903 --> 02:36:47,991
[SPEAKER_79]: And knowing some of them personally, I can pretty much tell what they're going to say, where they fall on the spectrum here when they get up there to speak.

1750
02:36:49,052 --> 02:36:57,220
[SPEAKER_79]: And I know from listening to them speak prior and giving their address that I know that they also don't live in the area.

1751
02:36:57,800 --> 02:37:01,984
[SPEAKER_79]: So you need to be listening to the people that are directly affected.

1752
02:37:02,425 --> 02:37:02,745
[SPEAKER_79]: Thank you.

1753
02:37:07,351 --> 02:37:07,951
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1754
02:37:07,971 --> 02:37:09,951
[SPEAKER_47]: Go to the podium.

1755
02:37:10,732 --> 02:37:12,172
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record, please.

1756
02:37:12,212 --> 02:37:13,332
[SPEAKER_47]: You have three minutes.

1757
02:37:14,092 --> 02:37:18,433
[SPEAKER_40]: Hello, David Zabner, 107 Bowdoin Street.

1758
02:37:18,453 --> 02:37:23,434
[SPEAKER_40]: I want to speak in support of this zoning change and of the zoning change across the city.

1759
02:37:24,874 --> 02:37:29,595
[SPEAKER_40]: I think Medford is ready to welcome more neighbors, to have more people living here.

1760
02:37:30,595 --> 02:37:36,496
[SPEAKER_40]: I think it's vitally important that we do our part to fix the housing crisis in the state and in our city.

1761
02:37:38,190 --> 02:37:41,513
[SPEAKER_40]: I don't think it makes any sense to trade less housing for more parking.

1762
02:37:42,033 --> 02:37:48,778
[SPEAKER_40]: I don't think it makes any sense to say that somehow more parking will make the city more walkable or more welcoming.

1763
02:37:49,758 --> 02:37:52,280
[SPEAKER_40]: I find nothing less welcoming than a Walmart parking lot.

1764
02:37:52,780 --> 02:37:57,664
[SPEAKER_40]: As somebody who grew up in the Midwest, I have seen what parking minimums do to small towns.

1765
02:37:57,864 --> 02:38:02,187
[SPEAKER_40]: And what they do is empty them entirely of people and fill them with cars.

1766
02:38:05,156 --> 02:38:08,239
[SPEAKER_40]: Salem Street is already has many commercial businesses.

1767
02:38:08,659 --> 02:38:14,003
[SPEAKER_40]: It's crazy to have an area where most of your businesses are actually out of zone.

1768
02:38:14,924 --> 02:38:17,766
[SPEAKER_40]: I think it makes a lot of sense to change the zoning to bring them in line.

1769
02:38:18,587 --> 02:38:26,774
[SPEAKER_40]: And I think it's super important that we increase Medford's tax base so that we can have the services that we hope for in the city.

1770
02:38:28,935 --> 02:38:35,059
[SPEAKER_40]: The last thing I'll say is I want to thank Eunice for pointing out the kind of classic case of nimbyism we're seeing here.

1771
02:38:35,619 --> 02:38:38,701
[SPEAKER_40]: People coming up and saying, listen, I'm all for more housing.

1772
02:38:38,761 --> 02:38:40,062
[SPEAKER_40]: I'm all for affordable housing.

1773
02:38:40,102 --> 02:38:41,643
[SPEAKER_40]: I think people deserve a place to live.

1774
02:38:41,703 --> 02:38:45,145
[SPEAKER_40]: I want my kids to be able to live here, just like not in my neighborhood.

1775
02:38:45,605 --> 02:38:50,146
[SPEAKER_40]: not near me, not near my school, not near the businesses I like to go to.

1776
02:38:51,526 --> 02:38:53,826
[SPEAKER_40]: That's a national and worldwide epidemic.

1777
02:38:53,886 --> 02:38:58,427
[SPEAKER_40]: And I thank Eunice for pointing out that we're seeing that really, really enforced here tonight.

1778
02:38:59,227 --> 02:39:00,188
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you so much for your time.

1779
02:39:00,228 --> 02:39:01,088
[SPEAKER_40]: I hope you vote yes.

1780
02:39:01,388 --> 02:39:02,528
[SPEAKER_40]: And thanks again.

1781
02:39:04,048 --> 02:39:05,368
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1782
02:39:06,469 --> 02:39:07,369
[SPEAKER_47]: We'll go back to Zoom.

1783
02:39:07,449 --> 02:39:08,689
[SPEAKER_47]: Gary, we're going to try again.

1784
02:39:08,749 --> 02:39:10,829
[SPEAKER_47]: Gary Marinelli, we're going to try you once more.

1785
02:39:11,129 --> 02:39:12,450
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm requesting you to unmute.

1786
02:39:13,150 --> 02:39:13,650
[SPEAKER_47]: Can you hear me now?

1787
02:39:14,733 --> 02:39:16,054
[SPEAKER_47]: We can hear you now, Gary.

1788
02:39:16,074 --> 02:39:17,595
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record, please.

1789
02:39:17,615 --> 02:39:18,356
[SPEAKER_47]: You have three minutes.

1790
02:39:18,816 --> 02:39:19,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks.

1791
02:39:19,257 --> 02:39:19,797
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening.

1792
02:39:19,897 --> 02:39:21,138
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Gary Marinelli.

1793
02:39:21,439 --> 02:39:29,866
[SPEAKER_07]: I live on Parrish Street, which is right off of Salem Street, and I am directly impacted by this plan, and I do strongly support the plan.

1794
02:39:30,847 --> 02:39:36,992
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm very happy that the city is looking at and proposing new zoning as part of the citywide zoning review.

1795
02:39:37,712 --> 02:39:40,835
[SPEAKER_07]: This is long overdue, and I'm happy to see this move forward.

1796
02:39:41,871 --> 02:39:48,874
[SPEAKER_07]: As we all know, Medford has a serious lack of housing and we need to increase density as a way to address that.

1797
02:39:49,835 --> 02:40:06,463
[SPEAKER_07]: Although this plan is not perfect, it's a very modest plan with modest increases and I'm happy that throughout the process, the committee took public feedback into account and we saw many changes to the plan along the way based on public feedback.

1798
02:40:07,568 --> 02:40:15,230
[SPEAKER_07]: I personally walk and drive on Salem Street every day, and we need to plan for the future and build a thriving Medford.

1799
02:40:16,290 --> 02:40:31,854
[SPEAKER_07]: By enabling more housing development, this increases the tax revenue and overall revenue base for the city so that hopefully we don't need additional citywide overrides in the future like the ones we just recently had.

1800
02:40:33,297 --> 02:40:38,663
[SPEAKER_07]: By changing this zoning, it also will draw new businesses to want to come into the area.

1801
02:40:39,764 --> 02:40:49,113
[SPEAKER_07]: I personally support a neighborhood with more commercial, more restaurants, more entertainment options, cafes, shops, and generally more things to do.

1802
02:40:50,155 --> 02:40:51,796
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to be able to walk to those things.

1803
02:40:52,757 --> 02:40:56,800
[SPEAKER_07]: To do that, we need more housing and we need to increase density.

1804
02:40:57,601 --> 02:41:04,907
[SPEAKER_07]: Businesses don't move to areas where there's a lack of housing, where there aren't people or areas that are not growing.

1805
02:41:05,688 --> 02:41:07,109
[SPEAKER_47]: Someone has a phone going off.

1806
02:41:07,169 --> 02:41:08,610
[SPEAKER_47]: Could you please just take it outside?

1807
02:41:08,850 --> 02:41:09,270
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1808
02:41:09,691 --> 02:41:16,957
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to zone for more businesses along Salem Street and generally speaking throughout the entire city of Medford.

1809
02:41:17,943 --> 02:41:24,605
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of businesses, many of the current businesses on Salem Street are currently non-conforming to our current zoning.

1810
02:41:26,165 --> 02:41:32,567
[SPEAKER_07]: If we update this zoning as proposed here tonight, these businesses will be in compliance, which only makes sense.

1811
02:41:33,727 --> 02:41:36,948
[SPEAKER_07]: What we are talking about now is preparing to grow for the future.

1812
02:41:37,949 --> 02:41:42,150
[SPEAKER_07]: We also need to keep in mind that just because zoning might allow more stories,

1813
02:41:43,595 --> 02:41:47,636
[SPEAKER_07]: That doesn't mean all the buildings overnight are going to grow to that size.

1814
02:41:48,517 --> 02:41:51,077
[SPEAKER_07]: We are planning now for the next 30 years.

1815
02:41:51,938 --> 02:41:55,759
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, I hope that the city council will support moving this forward tonight.

1816
02:41:56,539 --> 02:41:59,500
[SPEAKER_07]: Many compromises have been made along the way.

1817
02:41:59,580 --> 02:42:04,502
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, this is not perfect, but this is the best that we have.

1818
02:42:04,662 --> 02:42:07,343
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, thanks for your time and thanks for listening to me.

1819
02:42:07,363 --> 02:42:08,603
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you, Gary.

1820
02:42:10,632 --> 02:42:22,897
[SPEAKER_29]: Going to go back to the podium name and address for the record please give three minutes, which are 10 the street is a rude rude awakening rude wake up call here for everyone with what wants to bring businesses back to Salem Street.

1821
02:42:24,601 --> 02:42:27,383
[SPEAKER_29]: You're not gonna get any businesses back at Salem Street if there's no place to park.

1822
02:42:27,703 --> 02:42:30,705
[SPEAKER_29]: There's not gonna be enough people there to sustain business.

1823
02:42:31,245 --> 02:42:32,106
[SPEAKER_29]: Wake up.

1824
02:42:32,606 --> 02:42:34,947
[SPEAKER_29]: This is just natural stupidity.

1825
02:42:34,987 --> 02:42:36,348
[SPEAKER_29]: That's all I can call it, okay?

1826
02:42:36,749 --> 02:42:37,989
[SPEAKER_29]: You have to think about this stuff.

1827
02:42:38,049 --> 02:42:42,032
[SPEAKER_29]: No one in this room, no one in this city is against growth and development, including me.

1828
02:42:42,592 --> 02:42:43,973
[SPEAKER_29]: I want to see the city flourish.

1829
02:42:44,814 --> 02:42:46,915
[SPEAKER_29]: You have to be creative about where you're gonna do it.

1830
02:42:48,350 --> 02:42:51,171
[SPEAKER_29]: The members of this board are as much experts in zoning as I am.

1831
02:42:51,191 --> 02:42:53,052
[SPEAKER_29]: But you know what I am an expert at?

1832
02:42:53,232 --> 02:42:58,074
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm an expert at living in Salem Street, in the Salem Street neighborhood, living there over 45 years, 46 years.

1833
02:43:02,056 --> 02:43:06,678
[SPEAKER_29]: Many of those who are opposed to this zoning proposal are also expert living there, along, along with me.

1834
02:43:07,238 --> 02:43:11,340
[SPEAKER_29]: They're trying diligently to explain to you how this will negatively impact them.

1835
02:43:11,881 --> 02:43:16,223
[SPEAKER_29]: We have a vested interest in this district, and we have the residents whose lives will be impacted.

1836
02:43:16,623 --> 02:43:22,826
[SPEAKER_29]: There was a huge disconnect here between the city council and the actual residents who will suffer the consequences of poor zoning decisions.

1837
02:43:23,707 --> 02:43:27,848
[SPEAKER_29]: saying the developers have been doing the studies is like letting the fox guide the hen house.

1838
02:43:28,388 --> 02:43:31,988
[SPEAKER_29]: This is not, not, not going to bring affordable housing.

1839
02:43:32,629 --> 02:43:34,169
[SPEAKER_29]: It's just another empty sales pitch.

1840
02:43:34,649 --> 02:43:35,709
[SPEAKER_29]: People are falling for it.

1841
02:43:36,069 --> 02:43:40,950
[SPEAKER_29]: It will absolutely bring more congestion to an already crowded, dangerous area.

1842
02:43:41,070 --> 02:43:52,212
[SPEAKER_29]: So for this and many of the reasons that we'd be opposed to this plan, it would ask that your better judgment allows more study and reconsideration for a plan that the people who actually reside in that area can be more on board with.

1843
02:43:52,692 --> 02:43:56,197
[SPEAKER_29]: And again, whoever's saying not in my backyard, it's bull, you know what?

1844
02:43:56,517 --> 02:43:58,519
[SPEAKER_29]: It has nothing to do with not in my backyard.

1845
02:43:58,539 --> 02:44:02,564
[SPEAKER_29]: It has everything to do with making the right decisions in the right areas.

1846
02:44:02,604 --> 02:44:04,407
[SPEAKER_29]: That place is an old built area.

1847
02:44:04,427 --> 02:44:05,788
[SPEAKER_29]: It was built a long time ago.

1848
02:44:06,149 --> 02:44:10,794
[SPEAKER_29]: It wasn't built for the type of congestion you are starting to, trying to propose here.

1849
02:44:11,375 --> 02:44:21,040
[SPEAKER_29]: Please just think about it because you're listening to people who are experts but you're the ones making the decisions, you need to use your heads here.

1850
02:44:21,740 --> 02:44:30,344
[SPEAKER_29]: Go to Salem Street, don't tell me that that place can suspend sustain higher buildings and more congestion and more dense densely dense population.

1851
02:44:30,684 --> 02:44:31,064
[SPEAKER_29]: It can't.

1852
02:44:31,825 --> 02:44:34,046
[SPEAKER_29]: It needs help, unless you take the sidewalks out.

1853
02:44:35,098 --> 02:44:37,399
[SPEAKER_29]: What about the people who are disabled?

1854
02:44:37,559 --> 02:44:38,459
[SPEAKER_29]: What about the elderly?

1855
02:44:38,499 --> 02:44:40,339
[SPEAKER_29]: Not everybody's gonna be able to walk there.

1856
02:44:40,359 --> 02:44:45,681
[SPEAKER_29]: There are people who will need vehicles, whether they're electric or fossil fuel powered.

1857
02:44:46,181 --> 02:44:51,882
[SPEAKER_29]: There will be vehicles in the future, moving forward in the near future until someone else invents a spaceship.

1858
02:44:52,262 --> 02:44:53,462
[SPEAKER_29]: But- 30 seconds, Tony.

1859
02:44:53,682 --> 02:44:54,022
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

1860
02:44:54,503 --> 02:45:00,124
[SPEAKER_29]: But the fact of the matter is we need to consider that in our moving forward in the plans for the city.

1861
02:45:00,664 --> 02:45:04,065
[SPEAKER_29]: So again, I hope you just reconsider and no one is against

1862
02:45:04,933 --> 02:45:06,393
[SPEAKER_29]: the rezoning for the redevelopment.

1863
02:45:06,714 --> 02:45:10,355
[SPEAKER_29]: We don't want businesses that are not going to suit the neighborhood there.

1864
02:45:10,675 --> 02:45:14,776
[SPEAKER_29]: And we don't want to have to trip over each other when we're trying to walk down the damn street.

1865
02:45:15,196 --> 02:45:15,857
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you so much.

1866
02:45:16,417 --> 02:45:17,157
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1867
02:45:18,638 --> 02:45:25,640
[SPEAKER_47]: We'll go back to zoom out to go to Ren Bean Ren name and address for the record you have three minutes.

1868
02:45:26,927 --> 02:45:29,169
[SPEAKER_28]: Hi there run being 37 Woodrow Avenue.

1869
02:45:30,950 --> 02:45:33,532
[SPEAKER_28]: I just want to speak in favor of this zoning proposal.

1870
02:45:33,572 --> 02:45:38,396
[SPEAKER_28]: I've been following along with it over the past many months attended many meetings.

1871
02:45:38,516 --> 02:45:40,197
[SPEAKER_28]: I recognize a lot of the names and faces here.

1872
02:45:40,217 --> 02:45:45,321
[SPEAKER_28]: So, I appreciate how engaged the community has been and how open to feedback the.

1873
02:45:46,621 --> 02:45:54,288
[SPEAKER_28]: City Council and Community Development Board and the planners that the city has hired have been incorporating feedback from the community.

1874
02:45:54,368 --> 02:45:57,791
[SPEAKER_28]: I've seen the proposal evolve based on that feedback.

1875
02:45:57,851 --> 02:46:00,493
[SPEAKER_28]: And I just think the process has been really deliberate and thoughtful.

1876
02:46:00,553 --> 02:46:02,855
[SPEAKER_28]: So I want to recognize and thank everybody involved for that.

1877
02:46:04,590 --> 02:46:19,670
[SPEAKER_28]: I just also want to echo a lot of what's been said here tonight that we all know we're living in a housing shortage crisis and an affordability crisis in this country, but especially in Massachusetts and in Middlesex County and greater Boston.

1878
02:46:20,611 --> 02:46:21,612
[SPEAKER_28]: This is a great place to live.

1879
02:46:21,632 --> 02:46:22,832
[SPEAKER_28]: A lot of people want to live here.

1880
02:46:22,952 --> 02:46:23,893
[SPEAKER_28]: It drives up prices.

1881
02:46:24,153 --> 02:46:30,856
[SPEAKER_28]: And as a father of two young kids, I'd love to see a future where they could afford to stay in this general area if they would like to.

1882
02:46:30,956 --> 02:46:32,476
[SPEAKER_28]: And I'm not even just thinking about Medford.

1883
02:46:32,536 --> 02:46:34,797
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm thinking about a 50-mile radius near here.

1884
02:46:35,278 --> 02:46:44,442
[SPEAKER_28]: And Medford really has an opportunity here to take action and set an example for the future neighborhoods that are going to go through the same process.

1885
02:46:44,482 --> 02:46:46,503
[SPEAKER_28]: It's a citywide effort that I fully support.

1886
02:46:47,383 --> 02:46:49,624
[SPEAKER_28]: and a region-wide effort.

1887
02:46:49,644 --> 02:46:56,006
[SPEAKER_28]: A couple of people have talked about the need for nearly a quarter million new units in the next 10 years.

1888
02:46:56,066 --> 02:46:58,907
[SPEAKER_28]: I did some quick math at about 60,000 residents.

1889
02:46:59,728 --> 02:47:02,649
[SPEAKER_28]: Medford needs to create about 2,000 units over the next 10 years.

1890
02:47:04,009 --> 02:47:05,130
[SPEAKER_28]: That's really not that many.

1891
02:47:05,230 --> 02:47:07,951
[SPEAKER_28]: It's like one new unit for every 12 units that we have.

1892
02:47:09,211 --> 02:47:10,412
[SPEAKER_28]: I would happily welcome

1893
02:47:11,752 --> 02:47:20,138
[SPEAKER_28]: a couple new neighbors on my block, someone could turn their double-decker into a triple-decker, or their single family into a multi-family.

1894
02:47:20,658 --> 02:47:24,160
[SPEAKER_28]: And over 10 years, that's a really incremental change.

1895
02:47:24,240 --> 02:47:26,102
[SPEAKER_28]: And I think this zoning feels

1896
02:47:26,962 --> 02:47:35,289
[SPEAKER_28]: the headlines and the numbers maybe look more extreme than they are, because one, this only happens as people sell and renovate their properties.

1897
02:47:36,150 --> 02:47:44,116
[SPEAKER_28]: In order to meet the housing targets that we need to provide housing for people that want to live in this area, we need to allow it.

1898
02:47:44,216 --> 02:47:50,401
[SPEAKER_28]: And we need to allow what on paper would be a lot more than we will actually achieve, because a lot of people aren't going to renovate their homes.

1899
02:47:50,421 --> 02:47:52,002
[SPEAKER_28]: A lot of people aren't going to sell their houses.

1900
02:47:52,483 --> 02:47:55,585
[SPEAKER_28]: So by allowing more units on each parcel,

1901
02:47:56,957 --> 02:48:02,118
[SPEAKER_28]: small percentage, not 100% of them, will change to the maximum allowable amount.

1902
02:48:02,178 --> 02:48:03,839
[SPEAKER_28]: So I just think that's worth considering.

1903
02:48:04,119 --> 02:48:19,423
[SPEAKER_28]: Nobody knows exactly how much will change, but I think what's proposed here will allow about the right amount of change, and I hope other neighborhoods will follow suit and will grow the tax base for projects and other priorities that the city has.

1904
02:48:20,664 --> 02:48:23,865
[SPEAKER_28]: Roads, streets, teacher salaries, fire, police, all those resources

1905
02:48:25,665 --> 02:48:27,727
[SPEAKER_28]: you know, we're losing to inflation in Act 250.

1906
02:48:27,787 --> 02:48:30,529
[SPEAKER_28]: So thank you very much, and I hope this passes tonight.

1907
02:48:31,069 --> 02:48:31,750
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1908
02:48:31,770 --> 02:48:33,511
[SPEAKER_47]: Go back to the podium.

1909
02:48:35,312 --> 02:48:36,493
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record, please.

1910
02:48:36,513 --> 02:48:39,035
[SPEAKER_47]: And if folks could please take their conversations outside.

1911
02:48:41,457 --> 02:48:42,718
[SPEAKER_47]: One second, Barry, go ahead.

1912
02:48:43,318 --> 02:48:45,220
[SPEAKER_05]: Barry Ingbern, 9 Draper Street.

1913
02:48:46,060 --> 02:48:51,905
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wanted to really thank and appreciate the City Council and Innos Associates.

1914
02:48:52,921 --> 02:49:00,964
[SPEAKER_05]: and the planning department for countless hours and evenings and meetings that you have spent on this process.

1915
02:49:01,064 --> 02:49:05,146
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's been really hard work over a really extended period of time.

1916
02:49:05,546 --> 02:49:08,267
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think you're doing good work.

1917
02:49:09,828 --> 02:49:14,410
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm here to fully support the Salem Street rezoning project.

1918
02:49:15,215 --> 02:49:22,721
[SPEAKER_05]: I would ideally support a plan that was closer to the original plan with greater density around the Park Street area.

1919
02:49:23,981 --> 02:49:27,464
[SPEAKER_05]: And I also support greatly reducing parking minimums.

1920
02:49:30,046 --> 02:49:40,133
[SPEAKER_05]: A good zoning plan with less deference to cars will set the stage for growing a more livable, vibrant, equitable, affordable, and walkable city.

1921
02:49:40,153 --> 02:49:42,275
[SPEAKER_05]: It will increase the tax base.

1922
02:49:43,046 --> 02:49:50,429
[SPEAKER_05]: will increase the number of housing units, and it'll increase the services that people who live in those housing units have.

1923
02:49:50,449 --> 02:49:55,450
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to clarify a couple of things that I think people aren't understanding.

1924
02:49:56,571 --> 02:50:01,973
[SPEAKER_05]: One is by decreasing parking minimums, you're not decreasing parking.

1925
02:50:02,753 --> 02:50:04,674
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not outlawing parking.

1926
02:50:05,294 --> 02:50:09,835
[SPEAKER_05]: No developer is going to build housing units without building parking.

1927
02:50:10,335 --> 02:50:11,196
[SPEAKER_05]: What you're saying is,

1928
02:50:12,439 --> 02:50:21,765
[SPEAKER_05]: that parking should not be required beyond what a developer thinks is needed to support their business or residential property.

1929
02:50:22,685 --> 02:50:24,966
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes sense.

1930
02:50:25,727 --> 02:50:34,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Set-asides for parking that we don't have set-asides for people does not make any sense at all.

1931
02:50:39,103 --> 02:50:49,928
[SPEAKER_05]: I also want to note that I live in Fulton Heights, and it's a place where we definitely need more commercial and mixed-use zoning and development.

1932
02:50:50,849 --> 02:51:04,575
[SPEAKER_05]: We have zero restaurants, almost no shops of any kind, almost no services, and since public transport up where I live is seriously lacking, I can't do anything except go for a walk without driving.

1933
02:51:05,825 --> 02:51:06,986
[SPEAKER_05]: that needs to be changed.

1934
02:51:07,046 --> 02:51:16,671
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to have commercial hubs in every part of the city so people can go shopping and do the things that they have to do without getting into their car.

1935
02:51:16,691 --> 02:51:17,151
[SPEAKER_47]: 30 seconds.

1936
02:51:18,012 --> 02:51:28,538
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just enthusiastic about creating a Medford that makes space for people and that treats everybody respectfully and equitably, and I thank you all.

1937
02:51:29,799 --> 02:51:30,119
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1938
02:51:34,307 --> 02:51:35,468
[SPEAKER_47]: We're going to go back to Zoom.

1939
02:51:36,068 --> 02:51:36,668
[SPEAKER_47]: Going to Zoom.

1940
02:51:37,809 --> 02:51:39,150
[SPEAKER_47]: I've carried Denny on Zoom.

1941
02:51:39,190 --> 02:51:40,831
[SPEAKER_47]: Carrie, name and address for the record, please.

1942
02:51:40,871 --> 02:51:41,712
[SPEAKER_47]: You have three minutes.

1943
02:51:45,971 --> 02:51:47,772
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi there, my name is Carrie Denny.

1944
02:51:48,132 --> 02:51:57,677
[SPEAKER_08]: I grew up here in Medford and I currently live at the house that I grew up in on 36 Parris Street, which is directly affected by this motion.

1945
02:51:58,898 --> 02:52:07,082
[SPEAKER_08]: As someone who grew up here and decided to come back by my family's home and raise my family here in the public school district,

1946
02:52:07,522 --> 02:52:17,855
[SPEAKER_08]: that is already the most densely populated school district in our region and for sure the Roberts is going to have the highest population of students in the area.

1947
02:52:18,697 --> 02:52:24,264
[SPEAKER_08]: My concern is that we're doing a disservice for the people who actually live here.

1948
02:52:24,684 --> 02:52:38,428
[SPEAKER_08]: So as someone who is directly affected by any events at the school or any events of the things that happen on Salem Street and for sure I want to be someone who is participatory in local businesses.

1949
02:52:38,668 --> 02:52:41,849
[SPEAKER_08]: I value the local businesses and things like that.

1950
02:52:42,509 --> 02:52:47,070
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out to Nappies who is a local business for the last 30 years in our community for sure.

1951
02:52:47,925 --> 02:52:53,770
[SPEAKER_08]: But the thing is, we're doing this in a way that negatively impacts the people who are here.

1952
02:52:54,291 --> 02:53:06,802
[SPEAKER_08]: As someone who has lived in this neighborhood and has seen what happens when developers buy up the properties in my neighborhood, I've seen an outrageous amount of more cars in the neighborhood.

1953
02:53:07,142 --> 02:53:07,823
[SPEAKER_08]: In order to

1954
02:53:09,423 --> 02:53:23,567
[SPEAKER_08]: fill these new condos and things like that that are coming into this neighborhood, you're having four, five, six people renting an apartment that's probably supposed to be for two or three people, but you're having four or five cars in the street.

1955
02:53:23,787 --> 02:53:26,608
[SPEAKER_08]: These people need a place to live.

1956
02:53:26,688 --> 02:53:27,369
[SPEAKER_08]: I 100% understand that.

1957
02:53:27,709 --> 02:53:31,550
[SPEAKER_08]: And I want to encourage that, the growth, but it needs to be in a place where

1958
02:53:32,555 --> 02:53:33,416
[SPEAKER_08]: It makes sense.

1959
02:53:33,636 --> 02:53:42,965
[SPEAKER_08]: So we need to make sure that those parking spots are there for people so that they can be in their homes and don't have to carry groceries for two blocks.

1960
02:53:43,365 --> 02:53:56,518
[SPEAKER_08]: It does not make sense for young families to have to have situations where they're going into the store and then carrying their groceries for three blocks because they can't get to their homes because there's a million cars on the street.

1961
02:53:57,352 --> 02:54:02,556
[SPEAKER_08]: The other thing is this is a neighborhood where we're trying to grow and foster things where it's walkable.

1962
02:54:02,736 --> 02:54:03,997
[SPEAKER_08]: I totally understand that.

1963
02:54:04,437 --> 02:54:13,943
[SPEAKER_08]: But we're also seeing things where you're asking people to say, yep, we're going to put six stories on a street that was a walkable people-based neighborhood.

1964
02:54:14,283 --> 02:54:14,804
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, great.

1965
02:54:15,804 --> 02:54:21,048
[SPEAKER_08]: What's all that traffic going to do to Route 60 that's already congested from 7 a.m.

1966
02:54:21,248 --> 02:54:22,329
[SPEAKER_08]: to 10 a.m.

1967
02:54:22,689 --> 02:54:26,512
[SPEAKER_08]: for school traffic and people trying to get to 93 or towards the Felsway?

1968
02:54:27,872 --> 02:54:31,236
[SPEAKER_08]: Same traffic happens from three o'clock to seven o'clock.

1969
02:54:32,017 --> 02:54:33,278
[SPEAKER_08]: I love Medford.

1970
02:54:33,338 --> 02:54:38,083
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so proud to be a Medford girl born and raised, but we need to do this ethically.

1971
02:54:38,123 --> 02:54:43,109
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to use the studies in a way that makes sense for Medford.

1972
02:54:43,409 --> 02:54:45,651
[SPEAKER_08]: And I appreciate everyone's candor on this.

1973
02:54:46,072 --> 02:54:47,553
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much for your time.

1974
02:54:47,573 --> 02:54:49,516
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1975
02:54:50,898 --> 02:54:51,799
[SPEAKER_47]: We're gonna go to the podium.

1976
02:54:51,899 --> 02:54:53,239
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record, please.

1977
02:54:53,279 --> 02:54:55,601
[SPEAKER_47]: You have three minutes.

1978
02:54:56,561 --> 02:54:57,082
[SPEAKER_26]: Good evening.

1979
02:54:57,122 --> 02:54:58,582
[SPEAKER_26]: My name is Matthew Page Lieberman.

1980
02:54:58,602 --> 02:55:00,203
[SPEAKER_26]: I live at 15 Canal Street.

1981
02:55:01,224 --> 02:55:10,869
[SPEAKER_26]: First, I really appreciate tonight that no matter where people were, they actually showed their humanity in expressing their condolences to you, President Pierce.

1982
02:55:11,069 --> 02:55:11,410
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1983
02:55:11,910 --> 02:55:15,172
[SPEAKER_26]: There was an event a few, I don't know, a few meetings back

1984
02:55:15,992 --> 02:55:23,557
[SPEAKER_26]: in which a member of the council had really kind of choked up about having experienced a loss.

1985
02:55:24,418 --> 02:55:28,881
[SPEAKER_26]: And I was hoping some of the councillors could call for a break.

1986
02:55:29,542 --> 02:55:31,023
[SPEAKER_26]: As a resident, it was not my position.

1987
02:55:31,758 --> 02:55:32,758
[SPEAKER_26]: position to do that.

1988
02:55:33,619 --> 02:55:39,881
[SPEAKER_26]: But there is a reason that there was no break, and that was because this was also tied into another initiative.

1989
02:55:40,761 --> 02:55:42,721
[SPEAKER_26]: Does that, does that need to be muted?

1990
02:55:42,761 --> 02:55:47,503
[SPEAKER_26]: This was also tied to another initiative because somebody had been killed by a motorist.

1991
02:55:48,083 --> 02:55:55,625
[SPEAKER_26]: And this was how, you know, it was tied, the resolution also had an action about how to address, you know, these, these deaths of pedestrians.

1992
02:55:56,146 --> 02:55:59,947
[SPEAKER_26]: If I recall correctly, a person was crossing in the crosswalk, they were killed, and their

1993
02:56:00,787 --> 02:56:02,649
[SPEAKER_26]: was hospitalized but I think survived.

1994
02:56:03,670 --> 02:56:07,693
[SPEAKER_26]: That kind of, it loops back to tonight.

1995
02:56:08,534 --> 02:56:12,657
[SPEAKER_26]: Somebody said that you all should be working on pedestrian safety.

1996
02:56:13,718 --> 02:56:17,041
[SPEAKER_26]: And you, Councilmember Perez, you pointed out that you actually are.

1997
02:56:17,121 --> 02:56:19,623
[SPEAKER_26]: There's this law on the internet, it's called Cunningham's Law,

1998
02:56:20,103 --> 02:56:26,027
[SPEAKER_26]: that if you want to get the correct answer, you should not ask a question, you should just say something that's incorrect, and a lot of people correct you.

1999
02:56:26,528 --> 02:56:28,009
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think that it's really good.

2000
02:56:28,069 --> 02:56:35,334
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, I, for me, if we care about, you know, safety, then we follow what's going on, and we get involved in that kind of stuff.

2001
02:56:35,734 --> 02:56:40,978
[SPEAKER_26]: And I'm glad that this this council really is and can rebut these kinds of attacks that the priorities are wrong.

2002
02:56:41,018 --> 02:56:42,619
[SPEAKER_26]: We don't care about people's safety.

2003
02:56:44,360 --> 02:56:47,864
[SPEAKER_26]: I am supporting this because I care about people's safety.

2004
02:56:47,984 --> 02:56:52,509
[SPEAKER_26]: I understand people's arguments are saying that these people from outside do not care.

2005
02:56:52,809 --> 02:56:54,471
[SPEAKER_26]: They're saying, what's better for you?

2006
02:56:54,551 --> 02:56:55,992
[SPEAKER_26]: You people don't understand it.

2007
02:56:56,353 --> 02:56:58,154
[SPEAKER_26]: But I think that there's something missing.

2008
02:56:58,615 --> 02:57:01,498
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't like for-profit development.

2009
02:57:02,018 --> 02:57:03,760
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm a subset of YIMBYs.

2010
02:57:03,820 --> 02:57:07,364
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm a SHIMBY, which is social housing in my backyard, or a FIMBY.

2011
02:57:07,724 --> 02:57:09,065
[SPEAKER_26]: public housing in my backyard.

2012
02:57:09,445 --> 02:57:16,491
[SPEAKER_26]: However, because of for-profit development, rather than just trying to shut it down, there's things that we can harness.

2013
02:57:17,011 --> 02:57:19,933
[SPEAKER_26]: And as Dave pointed out, those are community benefits.

2014
02:57:20,614 --> 02:57:22,775
[SPEAKER_26]: And that's why I really, really support this.

2015
02:57:22,835 --> 02:57:26,898
[SPEAKER_26]: If people say, well, it's so dangerous, you're only going to get worse.

2016
02:57:27,219 --> 02:57:32,783
[SPEAKER_26]: No, I mean, you have developers in, you harness the strength, the community meets with them and say, we want safety.

2017
02:57:32,803 --> 02:57:33,423
[SPEAKER_26]: 30 seconds.

2018
02:57:34,644 --> 02:57:36,025
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, well, that's about it.

2019
02:57:36,165 --> 02:57:41,189
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think that we should consider how to see things as opportunities rather than just things to shut down.

2020
02:57:41,650 --> 02:57:44,932
[SPEAKER_26]: For my last 30 seconds, I just think we should talk about this animosity.

2021
02:57:46,033 --> 02:57:51,478
[SPEAKER_26]: One resident really believes it's somehow significant that they can predict how people will fall.

2022
02:57:52,398 --> 02:57:57,042
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, I think you can also predict where people will sit here based on, you know, where their allegiances are.

2023
02:57:57,442 --> 02:57:59,184
[SPEAKER_26]: And we know that there's a lot of animosity.

2024
02:57:59,484 --> 02:58:11,733
[SPEAKER_26]: For instance, I think that when somebody has a roller coaster or roller skating fundraiser to prevent the opening of a shelter for victims of domestic violence, we know who will probably attend and who will not.

2025
02:58:11,953 --> 02:58:13,494
[SPEAKER_26]: There's nothing magical about that.

2026
02:58:13,594 --> 02:58:14,095
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

2027
02:58:17,014 --> 02:58:23,599
[SPEAKER_47]: to go to zoom I have Donna Messina on zoom Donna name and address for the record please you have three minutes.

2028
02:58:24,640 --> 02:58:28,983
[SPEAKER_66]: Hi, my name is Donna Messina I live at 302 Salem Street, right next to the pit.

2029
02:58:29,503 --> 02:58:35,348
[SPEAKER_66]: I live across from Eddie's which does not have apartments on top of it, and Douglas bakery and I just want to say,

2030
02:58:36,258 --> 02:58:38,859
[SPEAKER_66]: I'm so opposed to this rezoning.

2031
02:58:39,340 --> 02:58:41,341
[SPEAKER_66]: The traffic is ridiculous.

2032
02:58:41,561 --> 02:58:43,041
[SPEAKER_66]: I can't get out of my driveway.

2033
02:58:43,382 --> 02:58:45,142
[SPEAKER_66]: That's if nobody's parked across it.

2034
02:58:45,322 --> 02:58:50,645
[SPEAKER_66]: Every day I have to go to all the businesses and ask who's parked across my driveway.

2035
02:58:50,685 --> 02:58:52,126
[SPEAKER_66]: The city has put up signs.

2036
02:58:52,706 --> 02:58:56,612
[SPEAKER_66]: But yet, nobody cares about the goddamn signs, they just park there anyways.

2037
02:58:57,192 --> 02:58:58,354
[SPEAKER_66]: And it doesn't matter.

2038
02:58:58,534 --> 02:59:01,058
[SPEAKER_66]: I mean, there's no parking for these businesses.

2039
02:59:01,478 --> 02:59:06,526
[SPEAKER_66]: Now you want to put all these more businesses and all these other housing.

2040
02:59:06,926 --> 02:59:07,687
[SPEAKER_66]: We are so

2041
02:59:08,446 --> 02:59:22,587
[SPEAKER_66]: densely populated right now, we don't have any room for this, and all these people that don't live in the neighborhood that think that you know there's so much parking here, where is it come to my house and tell me where.

2042
02:59:23,603 --> 02:59:27,987
[SPEAKER_66]: stand up front of my house and tell the people where to park so they're not parked in my driveway.

2043
02:59:28,328 --> 02:59:29,609
[SPEAKER_66]: My husband is handicapped.

2044
02:59:29,929 --> 02:59:34,213
[SPEAKER_66]: He comes home and he can't get in the driveway because somebody's parked across my driveway.

2045
02:59:34,494 --> 02:59:36,335
[SPEAKER_66]: He has to go try to find parking.

2046
02:59:37,036 --> 02:59:39,539
[SPEAKER_66]: I'm just, I want to say I'm so opposed.

2047
02:59:39,859 --> 02:59:42,822
[SPEAKER_66]: There's been no traffic studies and they say, oh no,

2048
02:59:43,573 --> 02:59:45,214
[SPEAKER_66]: We'll do that after it's zoned.

2049
02:59:45,514 --> 02:59:49,395
[SPEAKER_66]: So you zone it, and then once it's zoned, you do the traffic studies.

2050
02:59:49,535 --> 02:59:50,415
[SPEAKER_66]: I just don't get it.

2051
02:59:50,815 --> 02:59:52,516
[SPEAKER_66]: I've lived in Medford most of my life.

2052
02:59:52,636 --> 02:59:53,596
[SPEAKER_66]: I was born here.

2053
02:59:53,616 --> 02:59:54,796
[SPEAKER_66]: I was raised here.

2054
02:59:54,896 --> 02:59:56,257
[SPEAKER_66]: I was raised on Hadley Place.

2055
02:59:56,717 --> 03:00:01,559
[SPEAKER_66]: I mean, I just don't understand how you can do this to the people that live here.

2056
03:00:03,499 --> 03:00:05,040
[SPEAKER_66]: I'm just so opposed.

2057
03:00:06,680 --> 03:00:07,080
[SPEAKER_66]: I don't know.

2058
03:00:07,380 --> 03:00:07,720
[SPEAKER_66]: I don't know.

2059
03:00:08,041 --> 03:00:11,962
[SPEAKER_66]: I'm just, I want to go on record as saying I'm opposed, and I guess that's all I have to say.

2060
03:00:12,302 --> 03:00:12,622
[SPEAKER_66]: Thank you.

2061
03:00:14,445 --> 03:00:15,226
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

2062
03:00:15,246 --> 03:00:19,469
[SPEAKER_47]: Go to the podium, name and address for the record, please.

2063
03:00:19,509 --> 03:00:20,269
[SPEAKER_47]: You have three minutes.

2064
03:00:21,030 --> 03:00:21,791
[SPEAKER_58]: Hi, good evening.

2065
03:00:21,851 --> 03:00:24,473
[SPEAKER_58]: Patricia Ciappelli, 53 Garfield Avenue.

2066
03:00:24,493 --> 03:00:35,281
[SPEAKER_58]: I would like to say that the zoning is climate action and it's going to meet our climate goals is laughable.

2067
03:00:35,781 --> 03:00:39,584
[SPEAKER_58]: It's also laughable to say that it's going to meet our affordable housing.

2068
03:00:39,684 --> 03:00:40,265
[SPEAKER_58]: It is not.

2069
03:00:41,085 --> 03:00:44,029
[SPEAKER_58]: And to say that it's going to raise tax money, it will not.

2070
03:00:44,550 --> 03:00:57,988
[SPEAKER_58]: And the simple reason is the infrastructure studies haven't been done and the cost that it's going to take on wear and tear on our electric grids, on our sewer, on our water is going to be insurmountable and somebody is going to have to pay for that.

2071
03:00:58,308 --> 03:01:02,091
[SPEAKER_58]: And at the end of the day, if we're at a break-even, I would consider us lucky.

2072
03:01:02,652 --> 03:01:06,215
[SPEAKER_58]: So I think we do need to stick to, I am opposed to this.

2073
03:01:06,695 --> 03:01:09,497
[SPEAKER_58]: I think you need to go back and do the feasibility studies.

2074
03:01:09,597 --> 03:01:10,658
[SPEAKER_58]: Start from the beginning.

2075
03:01:11,099 --> 03:01:12,900
[SPEAKER_58]: Do it the right way.

2076
03:01:13,361 --> 03:01:14,481
[SPEAKER_58]: Don't cut corners.

2077
03:01:14,942 --> 03:01:17,924
[SPEAKER_58]: I understand this is a big project and we haven't done this before.

2078
03:01:18,545 --> 03:01:22,068
[SPEAKER_58]: All the more reason to do it the right way so we have the right knowledge.

2079
03:01:22,988 --> 03:01:24,990
[SPEAKER_58]: And so again, I'm against this.

2080
03:01:25,590 --> 03:01:26,891
[SPEAKER_58]: I am right in the thick of it.

2081
03:01:27,511 --> 03:01:31,113
[SPEAKER_58]: I love the neighborhood, but there's a better way to do it than this.

2082
03:01:31,534 --> 03:01:34,596
[SPEAKER_58]: And we are already in the hot, hot zone.

2083
03:01:34,656 --> 03:01:39,258
[SPEAKER_58]: If you look at a climate map, we are red, red, red.

2084
03:01:39,639 --> 03:01:43,661
[SPEAKER_58]: So to say we're gonna flip to green by adding more people doesn't work.

2085
03:01:45,542 --> 03:01:45,963
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

2086
03:01:49,755 --> 03:01:53,036
[SPEAKER_47]: We're gonna go to Sue Brown on Zoom, the last hand on Zoom.

2087
03:01:53,156 --> 03:01:54,677
[SPEAKER_47]: Sue, name and address for the record.

2088
03:01:54,697 --> 03:01:55,557
[SPEAKER_47]: You have three minutes.

2089
03:01:58,338 --> 03:01:59,319
[SPEAKER_61]: Hi, good evening.

2090
03:01:59,339 --> 03:02:08,883
[SPEAKER_61]: I just wanted to thank the Medford City Council for taking on the hard work to recodify Medford zoning across the city.

2091
03:02:09,863 --> 03:02:17,086
[SPEAKER_61]: The process has included multiple points of entry for public participation, both for education and for comment.

2092
03:02:19,253 --> 03:02:37,799
[SPEAKER_61]: For myself, in watching the rezoning efforts progress, I've become more in favor of denser zoning in all of the city's urban corridors, including Salem Street, and including my neighborhood, which is in West Medford, dressed for the record as Pine Ridge Road, Medford.

2093
03:02:39,920 --> 03:02:48,323
[SPEAKER_61]: I'm also in favor of protecting and investing in the city's open spaces, thereby becoming a greener Medford,

2094
03:02:48,737 --> 03:02:50,517
[SPEAKER_61]: I think the two can go hand in hand.

2095
03:02:52,378 --> 03:03:15,283
[SPEAKER_61]: I urge the city council to vote in favor of zoning changes that do not require parking minimums, that do provide the way for owners to invest in their property by building more housing and by protecting open spaces by increasing in density, the density in urban corridors.

2096
03:03:16,083 --> 03:03:16,743
[SPEAKER_61]: Thank you very much.

2097
03:03:19,345 --> 03:03:19,846
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

2098
03:03:22,593 --> 03:03:25,079
[SPEAKER_47]: There's another hand on Zoom, but we'll go to the podium first.

2099
03:03:25,159 --> 03:03:26,542
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record, please.

2100
03:03:26,562 --> 03:03:27,886
[SPEAKER_47]: You have three minutes.

2101
03:03:28,187 --> 03:03:30,488
[SPEAKER_62]: Paulette Vartabedian, Central Lab Medford.

2102
03:03:30,808 --> 03:03:35,171
[SPEAKER_62]: And let me just start again to say my condolences to you, Zach, and the loss of your friends.

2103
03:03:35,611 --> 03:03:48,257
[SPEAKER_62]: And to also thank everyone that's been involved, both the Planning Commission and the City Councilors, and also all the residents, both pro and con, that have come and given an opinion on our city.

2104
03:03:48,537 --> 03:03:49,098
[SPEAKER_62]: So thank you.

2105
03:03:50,979 --> 03:03:56,341
[SPEAKER_62]: You probably know I am opposed to some parts of this zoning.

2106
03:03:56,681 --> 03:03:59,562
[SPEAKER_62]: I am not opposed to change the opposite.

2107
03:03:59,582 --> 03:04:01,883
[SPEAKER_62]: I am opposed to the six story heights.

2108
03:04:02,503 --> 03:04:05,184
[SPEAKER_62]: The three stories I think are fine in this neighborhood.

2109
03:04:06,144 --> 03:04:08,865
[SPEAKER_62]: As far as parking goes, you have to have some parking.

2110
03:04:08,985 --> 03:04:13,607
[SPEAKER_62]: Otherwise, the local businesses that you're trying to bring in or keep

2111
03:04:14,330 --> 03:04:20,752
[SPEAKER_62]: are not going to have enough customers that will sustain them.

2112
03:04:21,112 --> 03:04:26,653
[SPEAKER_62]: If some person, I'm not sure who it was, was saying, oh, when I drive by, I would love to see all the new businesses.

2113
03:04:27,433 --> 03:04:31,354
[SPEAKER_62]: You're not going to do that if there's nowhere to stop and go in.

2114
03:04:31,374 --> 03:04:40,916
[SPEAKER_62]: A lot of the things that have been brought up are contradictory to each other, such as this is going to be low income.

2115
03:04:40,996 --> 03:04:42,357
[SPEAKER_62]: It's not going to be low income.

2116
03:04:42,517 --> 03:04:43,557
[SPEAKER_62]: As it said, it's going to be

2117
03:04:44,517 --> 03:04:46,779
[SPEAKER_62]: um expensive units.

2118
03:04:48,040 --> 03:04:52,804
[SPEAKER_62]: That's fine but don't promote it as a low income affordable area.

2119
03:04:53,445 --> 03:05:05,755
[SPEAKER_62]: The other thing I do find very insulting is that people that do not live in the area and that also are not directly affected by this zoning change are making these comments

2120
03:05:06,527 --> 03:05:07,587
[SPEAKER_62]: They don't live there.

2121
03:05:07,708 --> 03:05:12,129
[SPEAKER_62]: I've lived there for my whole life, and I don't want to say how old, but a long time.

2122
03:05:12,550 --> 03:05:14,931
[SPEAKER_62]: My family has lived there for over 100 years.

2123
03:05:15,391 --> 03:05:19,873
[SPEAKER_62]: I grew up in Medford, went to public schools there, and I love Medford.

2124
03:05:20,093 --> 03:05:26,255
[SPEAKER_62]: But I will tell you that if I wasn't as old as I am, I have been looking to move out of Medford.

2125
03:05:26,516 --> 03:05:30,077
[SPEAKER_62]: But because of my age, it really restricts me.

2126
03:05:30,237 --> 03:05:31,538
[SPEAKER_62]: I have to have access to

2127
03:05:32,696 --> 03:05:34,277
[SPEAKER_62]: medical facilities, etc.

2128
03:05:35,197 --> 03:05:40,419
[SPEAKER_62]: Saying that I am 100% opposed to the medical facility approval in this area.

2129
03:05:40,759 --> 03:05:50,604
[SPEAKER_62]: We strong the residents strongly objected to that, mainly because I think this is your way of sneaking in the methadone dispensary.

2130
03:05:51,044 --> 03:05:53,125
[SPEAKER_62]: I don't trust that that's not going to happen.

2131
03:05:54,345 --> 03:06:03,132
[SPEAKER_62]: I also feel that we do want to keep local businesses, but Citizens Bank has already closed there because the rents went up.

2132
03:06:03,352 --> 03:06:04,513
[SPEAKER_62]: I know that for a fact.

2133
03:06:05,014 --> 03:06:09,877
[SPEAKER_62]: These landlords are thinking about getting these high rises.

2134
03:06:10,138 --> 03:06:11,499
[SPEAKER_62]: So this is what's happening.

2135
03:06:12,099 --> 03:06:14,101
[SPEAKER_62]: I've lived in Japan for many years.

2136
03:06:14,161 --> 03:06:15,262
[SPEAKER_62]: I've been there four times.

2137
03:06:15,602 --> 03:06:20,706
[SPEAKER_62]: In Tokyo, you cannot buy a car unless you prove where you can park it.

2138
03:06:22,232 --> 03:06:24,013
[SPEAKER_62]: Do we wanna be Tokyo?

2139
03:06:24,193 --> 03:06:25,414
[SPEAKER_62]: No, we're not Tokyo.

2140
03:06:25,814 --> 03:06:30,637
[SPEAKER_62]: But do we wanna become Somerville or Cambridge where it's a cement corridor?

2141
03:06:30,977 --> 03:06:32,658
[SPEAKER_62]: No, I don't think that is the way.

2142
03:06:32,938 --> 03:06:34,959
[SPEAKER_62]: So please do not vote on this tonight.

2143
03:06:35,219 --> 03:06:42,863
[SPEAKER_62]: Consider the residents that this directly impacts and those should be a majority of the people you listen to.

2144
03:06:43,083 --> 03:06:43,804
[SPEAKER_62]: Thank you very much.

2145
03:06:44,244 --> 03:06:44,764
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

2146
03:06:44,784 --> 03:06:47,846
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm gonna go back to Zoom.

2147
03:06:47,946 --> 03:06:50,708
[SPEAKER_47]: Harrison Green, name and address for the record please.

2148
03:06:50,748 --> 03:06:51,228
[SPEAKER_47]: Harrison.

2149
03:06:53,435 --> 03:06:57,137
[SPEAKER_30]: Hello, yes, Harrison Green to Ronaleigh Road, Medford.

2150
03:06:58,118 --> 03:07:01,800
[SPEAKER_30]: I'd like to start by addressing the previous comment about Tokyo.

2151
03:07:01,920 --> 03:07:12,166
[SPEAKER_30]: Tokyo has one of the best world-class public transit options and systems that allows itself to have a low car percentage or a low car amount in the city.

2152
03:07:13,186 --> 03:07:18,530
[SPEAKER_30]: But going on from that, I am very encouraged that the city council is looking into

2153
03:07:19,450 --> 03:07:21,390
[SPEAKER_30]: upzoning the city starting with Salem Street.

2154
03:07:21,490 --> 03:07:29,012
[SPEAKER_30]: I understand that there is a perception of inequity, and rightfully so, about doing this one at a time.

2155
03:07:29,932 --> 03:07:45,735
[SPEAKER_30]: Personally, I look forward to having this continue into the neighborhood near to me in West Medford, and I look forward to the advocates that are pushing for less density in their neighborhood, for pushing for more density in other neighborhoods when it doesn't affect them.

2156
03:07:47,275 --> 03:07:54,958
[SPEAKER_30]: But yes, I acknowledge that this proposal in the Salem Street corridor is imperfect.

2157
03:07:55,078 --> 03:07:58,659
[SPEAKER_30]: It is an attempt to address the housing crisis, to address the climate crisis.

2158
03:08:00,260 --> 03:08:07,923
[SPEAKER_30]: But one more thing is that the businesses on Salem Street are not as dependent on car business as the

2159
03:08:09,244 --> 03:08:18,910
[SPEAKER_30]: As previous commenters have said, I believe that cars do not buy goods from businesses and that people are the ones going into businesses and buying things.

2160
03:08:19,090 --> 03:08:26,295
[SPEAKER_30]: And that if we reduce the number of parking spaces, we will not actually see a reduction in business.

2161
03:08:26,315 --> 03:08:27,696
[SPEAKER_30]: We will see an increase in business.

2162
03:08:27,956 --> 03:08:28,256
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you.

2163
03:08:30,477 --> 03:08:30,878
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

2164
03:08:32,723 --> 03:08:35,006
[SPEAKER_47]: All right, I think we're in person from here on out.

2165
03:08:35,466 --> 03:08:39,932
[SPEAKER_47]: Of course, someone can always raise their hand and prove me wrong but name and address for the record please.

2166
03:08:40,272 --> 03:08:48,041
[SPEAKER_73]: You have three minutes, Diana Santiago 19 Paris Street, I'm right in the corridor that we're talking about I want to thank you for

2167
03:08:48,802 --> 03:08:52,386
[SPEAKER_73]: the work that you have done to try to be thoughtful of both sides.

2168
03:08:53,087 --> 03:08:58,833
[SPEAKER_73]: I have sat here tonight and I've seen eye rolls and comments and all sorts of stuff sitting over there.

2169
03:08:59,454 --> 03:09:05,801
[SPEAKER_73]: And I do feel that with two sides of the coin, there are good reasons on both sides.

2170
03:09:06,341 --> 03:09:09,125
[SPEAKER_73]: I don't think it's one side or like nothing.

2171
03:09:10,426 --> 03:09:12,947
[SPEAKER_73]: Yes, I think we need affordable housing.

2172
03:09:13,348 --> 03:09:17,951
[SPEAKER_73]: I also think we need to be thoughtful about each district and how we do that.

2173
03:09:18,432 --> 03:09:23,735
[SPEAKER_73]: There are some things that I've seen being a resident there with my children in the schools.

2174
03:09:23,775 --> 03:09:26,558
[SPEAKER_73]: And when we talk about traffic, everybody thinks about parking cars.

2175
03:09:27,058 --> 03:09:34,764
[SPEAKER_73]: I've seen it where the emergency vehicles and the fire department have not been able to get through when you go over by the Roberts Elementary School.

2176
03:09:37,085 --> 03:09:40,666
[SPEAKER_73]: I've seen that the kids don't have like a green field and stuff.

2177
03:09:40,726 --> 03:09:42,707
[SPEAKER_73]: And so the play spills out into the streets.

2178
03:09:43,547 --> 03:09:46,988
[SPEAKER_73]: So I find it very belittling when I hear not in my backyard.

2179
03:09:47,008 --> 03:09:48,429
[SPEAKER_73]: I'm not saying one way or another.

2180
03:09:48,529 --> 03:09:50,430
[SPEAKER_73]: I think this plan is better than the first plan.

2181
03:09:51,152 --> 03:09:59,177
[SPEAKER_73]: But there are pieces of information that the residents have that others who don't live there or have children in the school don't know.

2182
03:09:59,877 --> 03:10:13,164
[SPEAKER_73]: So I think there's a way to move forward being very thoughtful about that and trying to protect not building up the area around the Roberts Elementary School and thinking very carefully about what's coming in and out.

2183
03:10:13,304 --> 03:10:19,008
[SPEAKER_73]: Because if someone's having a heart attack, you want the fire truck if your house is burning down or the ambulance to get through.

2184
03:10:20,289 --> 03:10:24,675
[SPEAKER_73]: And so I just want you guys to value what both sides are saying.

2185
03:10:24,695 --> 03:10:34,249
[SPEAKER_73]: I feel like some people are not being heard and are being called fear mongers, but I also think that we do need to move forward.

2186
03:10:34,930 --> 03:10:37,551
[SPEAKER_73]: and thoughtfully build up more housing.

2187
03:10:38,111 --> 03:10:43,572
[SPEAKER_73]: So please listen to both sides of the coin and don't dismiss one side versus the other.

2188
03:10:44,012 --> 03:10:46,293
[SPEAKER_73]: It sounds like some people in here would like to happen.

2189
03:10:46,733 --> 03:10:50,694
[SPEAKER_73]: I think you guys have been very thoughtful by having FAQs in the community.

2190
03:10:50,714 --> 03:10:55,956
[SPEAKER_73]: And I've heard both sides have very good points for pro and against.

2191
03:10:56,656 --> 03:11:00,717
[SPEAKER_73]: So I just think there can be a thoughtful medium in between.

2192
03:11:01,357 --> 03:11:12,178
[SPEAKER_73]: Yes, not everybody's going to be 100% happy because they want their side and not the other, but we can be thoughtful and come together, and we can try to really figure out a way

2193
03:11:12,843 --> 03:11:23,730
[SPEAKER_73]: to make the most of the area, make it safe for emergency vehicles, for our children, and for the residents that are there, but also bring Medford forward.

2194
03:11:23,830 --> 03:11:25,151
[SPEAKER_18]: So- 30 seconds.

2195
03:11:25,552 --> 03:11:32,236
[SPEAKER_73]: I hope that you guys will not rush through anything and feel pressure one way or the other and make it really thoughtful.

2196
03:11:32,256 --> 03:11:36,479
[SPEAKER_73]: If we need more time to get this done, then we need more time to get this done to truly hear people.

2197
03:11:37,299 --> 03:11:37,660
[SPEAKER_73]: Thank you.

2198
03:11:38,780 --> 03:11:39,161
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

2199
03:11:42,775 --> 03:11:45,876
[SPEAKER_47]: Stay at the podium, name and address for the record, please, you have three minutes.

2200
03:11:46,896 --> 03:11:50,017
[SPEAKER_56]: Laurie Spinney-Flave, 55 Garfield Avenue.

2201
03:11:50,938 --> 03:11:59,621
[SPEAKER_56]: Nobody in the Salem Street area is against any kind of zoning changes.

2202
03:12:00,441 --> 03:12:07,223
[SPEAKER_56]: As you've admitted yourself, it's taken over almost 60 years since the city last looked at zoning.

2203
03:12:07,743 --> 03:12:11,525
[SPEAKER_56]: So I guess my first question is why are you trying to,

2204
03:12:12,505 --> 03:12:18,669
[SPEAKER_56]: throw it down everybody's throat so quickly, instead of, we've had one community meeting.

2205
03:12:19,510 --> 03:12:30,177
[SPEAKER_56]: You can spout how we've had 21 meetings so far, but only one of those were with the actual residents and taxpayers on Salem Street area.

2206
03:12:32,187 --> 03:12:46,350
[SPEAKER_56]: The second thing I'd like to point out is, like others have said, you'd have to bring the businesses in for Salem Street to be the walkable area that everybody envisions, but it never has been.

2207
03:12:46,370 --> 03:12:49,391
[SPEAKER_56]: I have been born and raised in this area.

2208
03:12:49,891 --> 03:12:52,432
[SPEAKER_56]: I lived off of Riverside Avenue when I grew up.

2209
03:12:55,089 --> 03:13:00,955
[SPEAKER_56]: Michael McGlynn did the ring road down here in the square, it demolished the square.

2210
03:13:01,736 --> 03:13:05,340
[SPEAKER_56]: All those businesses left and none of them ever came back.

2211
03:13:06,441 --> 03:13:09,604
[SPEAKER_56]: And how disappointing Medford Square is today.

2212
03:13:10,813 --> 03:13:15,114
[SPEAKER_56]: You have open space that you could be looking at housing, but you're not.

2213
03:13:15,714 --> 03:13:19,255
[SPEAKER_56]: You've taken away the things that people would actually walk to.

2214
03:13:19,775 --> 03:13:24,096
[SPEAKER_56]: Medford Square, right across from the Salton Stall, there used to be a supermarket.

2215
03:13:24,896 --> 03:13:29,017
[SPEAKER_56]: Salem Street, we used to have a supermarket that you could walk to.

2216
03:13:29,497 --> 03:13:35,598
[SPEAKER_56]: And I can't tell you how many residents who have lived in that area for a very long time

2217
03:13:36,425 --> 03:13:40,706
[SPEAKER_56]: Even today, talk about how sad it was when Johnny's left.

2218
03:13:41,747 --> 03:13:51,450
[SPEAKER_56]: If you think Target and that little microscopic little food area that they have qualifies as a shopping area, it's not.

2219
03:13:52,050 --> 03:13:57,032
[SPEAKER_56]: The closest supermarket for Salem Street residents is down at Stop and Shop.

2220
03:13:58,332 --> 03:14:01,073
[SPEAKER_56]: I am not riding my bike down to Stop and Shop.

2221
03:14:01,553 --> 03:14:03,774
[SPEAKER_56]: I am not walking down to Stop and Shop.

2222
03:14:05,778 --> 03:14:16,800
[SPEAKER_56]: My son is in the hospital right now with double pneumonia from walking from Cappy's to Salem Street because he can't get bus service half the time.

2223
03:14:17,400 --> 03:14:21,481
[SPEAKER_56]: And he can't afford by the end of the week to pay for Ubers anymore.

2224
03:14:21,501 --> 03:14:24,101
[SPEAKER_47]: 30 seconds and I'm sorry to hear that.

2225
03:14:24,341 --> 03:14:29,542
[SPEAKER_56]: I really would like to see this council take a big step back on all this zoning.

2226
03:14:30,082 --> 03:14:32,262
[SPEAKER_56]: It's taken 60 years to look at it.

2227
03:14:32,823 --> 03:14:34,803
[SPEAKER_56]: Then it's gonna take more than a few months

2228
03:14:35,985 --> 03:14:39,467
[SPEAKER_56]: to discuss it and make a plan that's good for everyone.

2229
03:14:40,227 --> 03:14:42,568
[SPEAKER_56]: Because that's not gonna be affordable housing.

2230
03:14:43,348 --> 03:14:49,051
[SPEAKER_56]: If it's not luxury housing, it's gonna be transient apartment housing.

2231
03:14:49,571 --> 03:14:51,492
[SPEAKER_56]: It's not housing, it's apartments.

2232
03:14:52,312 --> 03:14:52,712
[SPEAKER_56]: Thank you.

2233
03:14:53,253 --> 03:14:53,953
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

2234
03:14:59,115 --> 03:15:00,236
[SPEAKER_43]: Name and address for the record, please.

2235
03:15:00,276 --> 03:15:01,216
[SPEAKER_43]: You have three minutes.

2236
03:15:02,237 --> 03:15:04,778
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you, Sam Goldstein, 29 Martin Street.

2237
03:15:07,099 --> 03:15:09,900
[SPEAKER_43]: Thanks for allowing me to be here tonight.

2238
03:15:11,080 --> 03:15:21,865
[SPEAKER_43]: I've wanted to voice some general support for the Salem Street zoning proposal.

2239
03:15:22,005 --> 03:15:30,448
[SPEAKER_43]: Frankly, I preferred it before it went to the CDB and do want to express that.

2240
03:15:33,209 --> 03:15:36,130
[SPEAKER_43]: I think that, you know,

2241
03:15:37,690 --> 03:15:49,818
[SPEAKER_43]: I think this is a great opportunity for both, you know, Salem Street, for the city as a whole, as we go through, you know, the entirety of Medford in this process.

2242
03:15:50,519 --> 03:15:54,261
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm looking forward to what the built environment will be like in a few years.

2243
03:15:54,361 --> 03:16:02,247
[SPEAKER_43]: I think that, you know, we're talking about this like it's going to, like this is going to pass and then, you know, we're gonna have all of this development happening all at once.

2244
03:16:02,327 --> 03:16:07,270
[SPEAKER_43]: It's gonna take time, but I think that, you know, we're going to end up with a city that,

2245
03:16:08,400 --> 03:16:13,483
[SPEAKER_43]: you know, is going to, you know, frankly, just have more stuff for residents to do.

2246
03:16:14,443 --> 03:16:24,509
[SPEAKER_43]: You know, the density helps support more shops and businesses that give, you know, there'll be more of these closer to where folks live.

2247
03:16:24,829 --> 03:16:27,550
[SPEAKER_43]: It'll make it easier to live your life here.

2248
03:16:28,811 --> 03:16:32,233
[SPEAKER_43]: You know, it's not something I fear in that regard.

2249
03:16:32,253 --> 03:16:35,574
[SPEAKER_43]: I also think that, you know, as some others have said tonight,

2250
03:16:37,664 --> 03:16:44,387
[SPEAKER_43]: You know, this is stuff that's going to, these businesses, at least, are going to generate more tax revenue for the city.

2251
03:16:44,768 --> 03:16:55,013
[SPEAKER_43]: That's going to allow the city of Medford to better maintain its roads, to better, you know, install public safety infrastructure, which I think we do so desperately need.

2252
03:16:56,474 --> 03:17:00,836
[SPEAKER_43]: And, you know, ultimately, the world is changing around us, and we have to change with it.

2253
03:17:01,696 --> 03:17:06,839
[SPEAKER_43]: And I think that this is a, you know, a good effort to do that.

2254
03:17:09,113 --> 03:17:28,838
[SPEAKER_43]: I will offer a little bit of pushback, frankly, against the proposal that's been put forward to remove clinics and medical facilities from the neighborhood from this zoning proposal.

2255
03:17:28,878 --> 03:17:34,640
[SPEAKER_43]: I think given the conversation around this, the fact is at the end of the day, this is

2256
03:17:36,271 --> 03:17:42,854
[SPEAKER_43]: you know, basically being done to discriminate against folks with substance use challenges.

2257
03:17:43,294 --> 03:17:56,879
[SPEAKER_43]: And, you know, doing that is, I think, you know, it looks an awful lot like some of zoning's worst practices, like, you know, redlining.

2258
03:17:56,899 --> 03:18:04,923
[SPEAKER_43]: And I think maybe, you know, Robert Moses would have a smirk looking up on us if he was thinking about that.

2259
03:18:04,983 --> 03:18:05,783
[SPEAKER_43]: So thank you.

2260
03:18:07,415 --> 03:18:07,855
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you.

2261
03:18:07,875 --> 03:18:13,697
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record, please.

2262
03:18:13,717 --> 03:18:14,377
[SPEAKER_47]: You have three minutes.

2263
03:18:15,857 --> 03:18:17,458
[SPEAKER_42]: Nate Mara, 373 Riverside Ave.

2264
03:18:18,538 --> 03:18:22,139
[SPEAKER_42]: So I know we had a speaker who was from the Midwest.

2265
03:18:22,199 --> 03:18:23,700
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm not from that far out west.

2266
03:18:23,760 --> 03:18:24,980
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm just from Western Mass.

2267
03:18:25,340 --> 03:18:27,180
[SPEAKER_42]: But some people here might think it's the Midwest.

2268
03:18:27,821 --> 03:18:29,361
[SPEAKER_42]: And that's OK.

2269
03:18:29,441 --> 03:18:30,901
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm all right with people laughing at that.

2270
03:18:32,422 --> 03:18:36,123
[SPEAKER_42]: That said, there's plenty of housing out and availability for housing in Western Mass.

2271
03:18:37,800 --> 03:18:42,722
[SPEAKER_42]: The issue of affordable housing is not just a Medford issue, it's a statewide issue.

2272
03:18:42,782 --> 03:18:44,083
[SPEAKER_42]: So it's a tough nut to crack.

2273
03:18:45,543 --> 03:18:49,465
[SPEAKER_42]: There's a lot of merit on all sides for trying to handle that.

2274
03:18:50,586 --> 03:18:53,887
[SPEAKER_42]: But part of that is we wanna make sure what's good for the city, right?

2275
03:18:53,907 --> 03:18:55,908
[SPEAKER_42]: There's people that live here and call this place home.

2276
03:18:58,029 --> 03:19:06,173
[SPEAKER_42]: I was in emergency management myself at one point, I'm an EMT still, anyone's ever taken an airplane, it's the first thing they do when they say, when they do the emergency procedures.

2277
03:19:06,872 --> 03:19:06,992
[SPEAKER_42]: right?

2278
03:19:07,372 --> 03:19:09,954
[SPEAKER_42]: You put your mask on first before you go help out your neighbor.

2279
03:19:10,735 --> 03:19:14,038
[SPEAKER_42]: We need to make sure that the city and the residents are taken care of here first.

2280
03:19:14,978 --> 03:19:16,299
[SPEAKER_42]: Then we can help out other people.

2281
03:19:17,540 --> 03:19:20,463
[SPEAKER_42]: That's just common sense.

2282
03:19:21,964 --> 03:19:34,013
[SPEAKER_42]: So that said, my concern with Salem Street and especially biting the apple really big the way you are, you can call me an NB, but you've already developed my area before any of you were on the council, right?

2283
03:19:34,033 --> 03:19:35,975
[SPEAKER_42]: They did the 61 Locust Street project.

2284
03:19:37,058 --> 03:19:38,758
[SPEAKER_42]: It was not handled properly to procedure.

2285
03:19:38,798 --> 03:19:46,860
[SPEAKER_42]: In fact, the city violated open meeting laws for all sorts of, the city council got their own attorney to sue the city.

2286
03:19:48,060 --> 03:19:49,160
[SPEAKER_42]: Oh yeah, you should look into this.

2287
03:19:49,200 --> 03:19:51,381
[SPEAKER_42]: So when they say, don't worry, the process is in place.

2288
03:19:51,421 --> 03:19:55,902
[SPEAKER_42]: There's a history in this city where the processes don't always work out for the people that live there.

2289
03:19:57,582 --> 03:20:02,003
[SPEAKER_42]: So I do have some concerns in that and what's happening on Salem Street affects the whole city.

2290
03:20:02,643 --> 03:20:03,883
[SPEAKER_42]: Medford has roads.

2291
03:20:04,564 --> 03:20:05,904
[SPEAKER_42]: Medford has an interstate highway, 93.

2292
03:20:07,744 --> 03:20:09,165
[SPEAKER_42]: You know what you don't have in Cambridge?

2293
03:20:10,366 --> 03:20:12,207
[SPEAKER_42]: Interstate 93 and easy access.

2294
03:20:13,468 --> 03:20:19,853
[SPEAKER_42]: So I love commercial business because it offsets the residential taxes, two to one.

2295
03:20:20,854 --> 03:20:22,795
[SPEAKER_42]: We want commercial business to thrive.

2296
03:20:23,035 --> 03:20:24,436
[SPEAKER_42]: Salem Street's a great place for that.

2297
03:20:26,078 --> 03:20:28,299
[SPEAKER_42]: I don't think you're gonna get that with this particular plan.

2298
03:20:29,020 --> 03:20:33,283
[SPEAKER_42]: I'd love to see maybe a portion of it taken on.

2299
03:20:33,303 --> 03:20:35,585
[SPEAKER_42]: Affordable housing, I can barely afford what I got.

2300
03:20:35,885 --> 03:20:37,086
[SPEAKER_42]: I got two kids.

2301
03:20:37,855 --> 03:20:39,055
[SPEAKER_42]: Daycare $3,000 a month.

2302
03:20:40,255 --> 03:20:42,916
[SPEAKER_42]: Rent, mortgage, whatever you want to call it, $2,500 a month.

2303
03:20:42,956 --> 03:20:47,337
[SPEAKER_42]: You start talking, you need $200,000 a year just to afford that.

2304
03:20:47,497 --> 03:20:48,277
[SPEAKER_42]: That's affordable.

2305
03:20:49,417 --> 03:20:49,977
[SPEAKER_47]: 30 seconds, Nate.

2306
03:20:50,337 --> 03:20:54,798
[SPEAKER_42]: So versus just having luxury housing, which I have behind my house.

2307
03:20:55,638 --> 03:20:56,539
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm sure people like it.

2308
03:20:56,979 --> 03:20:59,539
[SPEAKER_42]: We fought for having them to have parking, and they use it.

2309
03:21:01,080 --> 03:21:02,840
[SPEAKER_42]: So I guess I'd say, please consider

2310
03:21:03,823 --> 03:21:08,267
[SPEAKER_42]: maybe scaling this back, and I know this is the gateway, and then you're gonna do it for the rest of the city.

2311
03:21:09,588 --> 03:21:16,033
[SPEAKER_42]: I wanna see Medford thrive also, economically, not just by a number of people in there.

2312
03:21:17,074 --> 03:21:17,374
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

2313
03:21:18,115 --> 03:21:18,616
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

2314
03:21:18,636 --> 03:21:22,419
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record, please.

2315
03:21:22,439 --> 03:21:23,199
[SPEAKER_47]: You have three minutes.

2316
03:21:25,141 --> 03:21:25,521
[SPEAKER_33]: Yes, sir.

2317
03:21:25,541 --> 03:21:26,062
[SPEAKER_33]: How are you doing?

2318
03:21:26,082 --> 03:21:27,243
[SPEAKER_33]: Bob Jones, 5 St.

2319
03:21:27,263 --> 03:21:28,464
[SPEAKER_33]: Mary Street, Method Bass.

2320
03:21:29,084 --> 03:21:32,027
[SPEAKER_33]: By a show of hands, who lives in the Sandal Street area?

2321
03:21:35,608 --> 03:21:35,988
[SPEAKER_33]: Interesting.

2322
03:21:36,028 --> 03:21:36,728
[SPEAKER_33]: I don't see anybody.

2323
03:21:36,748 --> 03:21:37,348
[SPEAKER_33]: Oh, you do.

2324
03:21:37,688 --> 03:21:37,988
[SPEAKER_33]: Okay.

2325
03:21:38,008 --> 03:21:41,749
[SPEAKER_33]: So out of the six votes that are here, we have one person that actually lives in the district.

2326
03:21:42,409 --> 03:21:42,669
[SPEAKER_33]: Okay.

2327
03:21:42,789 --> 03:21:43,189
[SPEAKER_33]: Interesting.

2328
03:21:44,050 --> 03:21:44,250
[SPEAKER_33]: All right.

2329
03:21:44,270 --> 03:21:47,210
[SPEAKER_33]: So I have a few questions on this development.

2330
03:21:47,910 --> 03:21:52,671
[SPEAKER_33]: Correct me if I'm wrong, but there is no requirement for affordable housing in any of these zoning laws.

2331
03:21:53,131 --> 03:21:53,771
[SPEAKER_33]: Is that correct?

2332
03:21:55,912 --> 03:21:56,292
[SPEAKER_33]: There is?

2333
03:21:56,832 --> 03:21:57,112
[SPEAKER_33]: Okay.

2334
03:21:57,452 --> 03:21:59,793
[SPEAKER_33]: Well, all right.

2335
03:22:00,113 --> 03:22:00,393
[SPEAKER_33]: Let's see.

2336
03:22:02,442 --> 03:22:07,265
[SPEAKER_33]: location for the new school, by new I mean additional, in addition to the schools that we have.

2337
03:22:07,285 --> 03:22:08,766
[SPEAKER_33]: I didn't see anything on there.

2338
03:22:09,667 --> 03:22:11,648
[SPEAKER_33]: Nor did I see anything for the new fire station.

2339
03:22:12,148 --> 03:22:15,490
[SPEAKER_33]: Again, in addition to the fire station that we already have.

2340
03:22:15,510 --> 03:22:22,535
[SPEAKER_33]: I don't see any plan for the upgrade of water, sewer, electrical, any of the infrastructure.

2341
03:22:23,375 --> 03:22:26,557
[SPEAKER_33]: Was that looked at or thought about at all?

2342
03:22:29,039 --> 03:22:29,699
[SPEAKER_33]: I don't think it was.

2343
03:22:32,257 --> 03:22:36,099
[SPEAKER_33]: Has anybody tried to drive down Salem Street at five o'clock?

2344
03:22:36,899 --> 03:22:37,439
[SPEAKER_33]: I know I have.

2345
03:22:38,960 --> 03:22:39,880
[SPEAKER_33]: It's pretty impossible.

2346
03:22:40,841 --> 03:22:44,843
[SPEAKER_33]: Anybody that tried to get a space in the Target parking lot at about five o'clock?

2347
03:22:46,583 --> 03:22:47,984
[SPEAKER_33]: Again, near impossible.

2348
03:22:48,945 --> 03:22:51,966
[SPEAKER_33]: Traffic and parking is horrendous today.

2349
03:22:53,186 --> 03:22:57,048
[SPEAKER_33]: This is gonna put a huge burden on that area and on that city.

2350
03:22:57,869 --> 03:23:00,930
[SPEAKER_33]: So we're gonna go from virtually no development in Medford

2351
03:23:01,478 --> 03:23:03,378
[SPEAKER_33]: to overdevelopment in one boat.

2352
03:23:04,559 --> 03:23:13,200
[SPEAKER_33]: And I was just wondering why none of these zoning requirements were rolled out for the Mystic Ave area, where there is virtually nobody, it's already commercially zoned.

2353
03:23:13,520 --> 03:23:16,321
[SPEAKER_33]: We did do this already on Mystic Ave, it passed in December.

2354
03:23:17,041 --> 03:23:18,641
[SPEAKER_33]: How about the commercial street area?

2355
03:23:19,501 --> 03:23:21,281
[SPEAKER_47]: That's on our agenda for a couple months.

2356
03:23:21,301 --> 03:23:22,282
[SPEAKER_47]: That's our agenda, so yeah.

2357
03:23:23,302 --> 03:23:25,782
[SPEAKER_47]: This is happening in every part of the city.

2358
03:23:26,182 --> 03:23:27,903
[SPEAKER_33]: Gentrifying an entire neighborhood.

2359
03:23:28,283 --> 03:23:30,163
[SPEAKER_33]: It's really way too much.

2360
03:23:31,340 --> 03:23:36,365
[SPEAKER_33]: It's a huge impact in this area that people don't want.

2361
03:23:36,385 --> 03:23:40,509
[SPEAKER_33]: The majority of people that are speaking for this project live in West Medford.

2362
03:23:40,869 --> 03:23:41,690
[SPEAKER_33]: I wonder why that is.

2363
03:23:42,731 --> 03:23:47,696
[SPEAKER_33]: But I would just ask you to give a little more credence to the people that live in the area.

2364
03:23:48,337 --> 03:23:49,858
[SPEAKER_33]: They're the ones that are going to be affected.

2365
03:23:50,579 --> 03:23:53,602
[SPEAKER_33]: And I think it makes zero sense to gentrify an area

2366
03:23:54,564 --> 03:23:58,967
[SPEAKER_33]: for affordable housing, which in, I don't understand how that's gonna happen.

2367
03:23:59,027 --> 03:24:03,589
[SPEAKER_33]: I think that's gonna cause housing prices to increase substantially.

2368
03:24:04,089 --> 03:24:04,790
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

2369
03:24:04,850 --> 03:24:05,410
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

2370
03:24:10,473 --> 03:24:11,974
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record, please.

2371
03:24:13,175 --> 03:24:14,976
[SPEAKER_48]: Andrew from Salem Street.

2372
03:24:17,657 --> 03:24:20,879
[SPEAKER_48]: I'm glad someone did a great call to arms.

2373
03:24:21,239 --> 03:24:23,901
[SPEAKER_48]: This side of the room is like the Congress in Washington DC.

2374
03:24:24,629 --> 03:24:34,243
[SPEAKER_48]: They're all speaking for this proposal development, and not one of them, as far as I can tell, gave an address of Sill Street, not even close.

2375
03:24:35,104 --> 03:24:35,505
[SPEAKER_48]: Good job.

2376
03:24:37,096 --> 03:24:40,237
[SPEAKER_47]: There were several people who were given the address of Salem Street.

2377
03:24:40,257 --> 03:24:42,878
[SPEAKER_48]: You don't want to waste my time and tell me where the addresses are, I'll listen.

2378
03:24:43,138 --> 03:24:50,241
[SPEAKER_47]: There's Lambert Street, Garfield Street, Farragut Avenue, Vine Street, Everett Street, Almont Street.

2379
03:24:50,581 --> 03:24:51,921
[SPEAKER_47]: I can continue to name the streets if you want.

2380
03:24:51,941 --> 03:24:52,921
[SPEAKER_48]: I can stand to be corrected.

2381
03:24:53,322 --> 03:24:55,202
[SPEAKER_48]: But it was a good call to arms, regardless.

2382
03:24:55,922 --> 03:24:56,883
[SPEAKER_48]: That you cannot deny.

2383
03:24:56,903 --> 03:25:03,225
[SPEAKER_48]: I'm usually in favor of new development if it's smart development.

2384
03:25:05,740 --> 03:25:08,601
[SPEAKER_48]: But Salem Street is already too congested.

2385
03:25:09,021 --> 03:25:10,402
[SPEAKER_48]: Stop this, please.

2386
03:25:10,422 --> 03:25:16,804
[SPEAKER_48]: Or let them vote on the issue from Lambert Street and Salem Street and other connected streets.

2387
03:25:17,004 --> 03:25:18,744
[SPEAKER_48]: Let them vote on it and not you.

2388
03:25:18,764 --> 03:25:22,266
[SPEAKER_48]: Because they have to live with this.

2389
03:25:25,427 --> 03:25:28,808
[SPEAKER_48]: Presume all your councilors still reside in Medford.

2390
03:25:32,048 --> 03:25:36,089
[SPEAKER_48]: While you don't reside in Medford and everyone here lives in Medford.

2391
03:25:36,209 --> 03:25:36,589
[SPEAKER_47]: Okay.

2392
03:25:36,989 --> 03:25:39,750
[SPEAKER_48]: Anyone reside on on selling street.

2393
03:25:40,070 --> 03:25:41,030
[SPEAKER_48]: He took my question.

2394
03:25:42,871 --> 03:25:44,771
[SPEAKER_48]: What street is to the chair.

2395
03:25:46,032 --> 03:25:48,672
[SPEAKER_47]: So, Washington Street.

2396
03:25:48,932 --> 03:25:49,112
[SPEAKER_48]: All right.

2397
03:25:54,453 --> 03:25:58,395
[SPEAKER_48]: I told you once and I told you twice, but you never listened to my advice.

2398
03:25:58,836 --> 03:26:00,797
[SPEAKER_48]: Mystic Avenue is the only place.

2399
03:26:01,317 --> 03:26:01,978
[SPEAKER_48]: It's the best.

2400
03:26:03,218 --> 03:26:04,259
[SPEAKER_48]: It's your ace in the hole.

2401
03:26:04,539 --> 03:26:10,263
[SPEAKER_48]: You can do eminent domain through the government power, and you could have seven buildings, 10 stories high.

2402
03:26:10,563 --> 03:26:13,865
[SPEAKER_48]: First floor is around the clock, 7-Elevens, coffee shops.

2403
03:26:14,405 --> 03:26:19,528
[SPEAKER_48]: Second floor and the third floor can be offices and things of that nature.

2404
03:26:19,808 --> 03:26:22,250
[SPEAKER_48]: And the third, fourth floor up to the 10th,

2405
03:26:22,946 --> 03:26:24,907
[SPEAKER_48]: could be truly affordable housing?

2406
03:26:25,868 --> 03:26:27,529
[SPEAKER_48]: Because I don't know what affordable housing is.

2407
03:26:27,569 --> 03:26:28,669
[SPEAKER_48]: I'm sure I can't afford.

2408
03:26:28,930 --> 03:26:32,772
[SPEAKER_48]: How much is affordable housing, Mr. Pierce, right now in this city?

2409
03:26:33,552 --> 03:26:33,893
[SPEAKER_48]: How much?

2410
03:26:35,413 --> 03:26:36,614
[SPEAKER_47]: That's a complicated question.

2411
03:26:37,194 --> 03:26:37,375
[SPEAKER_48]: No, no.

2412
03:26:38,395 --> 03:26:38,976
[SPEAKER_48]: Simple answer.

2413
03:26:39,016 --> 03:26:42,638
[SPEAKER_48]: Give me a simple answer.

2414
03:26:42,658 --> 03:26:45,539
[SPEAKER_48]: 100 bucks, 10,000 bucks a month, ballpark.

2415
03:26:47,521 --> 03:26:49,622
[SPEAKER_47]: Well, let's just have you finish it up.

2416
03:26:51,661 --> 03:26:54,782
[SPEAKER_48]: Well, I'd like to know, because it's not affordable to me.

2417
03:26:54,842 --> 03:26:58,004
[SPEAKER_48]: I can't even afford cigarettes at $16 a pack.

2418
03:27:00,445 --> 03:27:05,767
[SPEAKER_48]: Okay, the worst thing, the whole thing, which really fries my rear end is this.

2419
03:27:06,007 --> 03:27:15,271
[SPEAKER_48]: You're gonna collect millions of dollars, tens of millions of dollars of real estate tax, additional real estate tax on top of the present tax.

2420
03:27:16,092 --> 03:27:21,414
[SPEAKER_48]: And it's not gonna have our real estate come back down even a dollar, as Dr. Sorella begged you.

2421
03:27:22,556 --> 03:27:30,559
[SPEAKER_48]: It's gonna increase, every year you're gonna add 2.5% to the levy, then the levy is gonna be much higher.

2422
03:27:30,959 --> 03:27:35,020
[SPEAKER_48]: So it's progressive forever and ever until we get to Oak Grove.

2423
03:27:35,240 --> 03:27:38,141
[SPEAKER_48]: It's not fair to Salem Street, period.

2424
03:27:39,282 --> 03:27:46,384
[SPEAKER_47]: And as regards Mystic Avenue, I'd recommend folks go to medfordma.org slash zoning.

2425
03:27:46,924 --> 03:27:48,845
[SPEAKER_47]: You can see the zoning we passed for Mystic Avenue.

2426
03:27:50,064 --> 03:27:51,325
[SPEAKER_47]: Andy described it pretty well.

2427
03:27:51,725 --> 03:27:58,108
[SPEAKER_47]: It's a first floor commercial and then up to, I believe, 10 stories with four more incentive stories up to 14.

2428
03:27:58,248 --> 03:28:00,790
[SPEAKER_47]: So it's a pretty intense proposal for Mystic Avenue.

2429
03:28:01,950 --> 03:28:05,232
[SPEAKER_47]: We'll go to the podium and then back to Zoom and then the podium again.

2430
03:28:05,272 --> 03:28:06,573
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record, please.

2431
03:28:06,653 --> 03:28:07,313
[SPEAKER_47]: You have three minutes.

2432
03:28:07,333 --> 03:28:08,414
[SPEAKER_60]: My name is Jennifer Yanko.

2433
03:28:08,454 --> 03:28:11,916
[SPEAKER_60]: I live at 16 Monument Street in West Medford.

2434
03:28:12,596 --> 03:28:19,320
[SPEAKER_60]: And I wanna thank the council for taking on this really important and long overdue project.

2435
03:28:20,439 --> 03:28:25,561
[SPEAKER_60]: citywide and I look forward to its arrival in West Medford.

2436
03:28:26,022 --> 03:28:26,462
[SPEAKER_60]: Thank you.

2437
03:28:27,982 --> 03:28:28,323
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you.

2438
03:28:28,443 --> 03:28:34,505
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm going to go to Zoom and then I'll come back to Zoom.

2439
03:28:34,525 --> 03:28:35,886
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm going to go to James Torres.

2440
03:28:35,926 --> 03:28:37,627
[SPEAKER_47]: James, name and address for the record, please.

2441
03:28:40,815 --> 03:28:41,896
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, my name is James Torres.

2442
03:28:41,936 --> 03:28:43,236
[SPEAKER_01]: I live at 48 Everett Street.

2443
03:28:44,197 --> 03:29:00,845
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to call in and say that while I know many people are supporting from West Medford, I live on Everett Street, which is in Glenwood directly right off of Salem Street, and I support this as well as I have noted several of my neighbors, both on Everett Street and several other

2444
03:29:02,852 --> 03:29:03,612
[SPEAKER_01]: streets nearby.

2445
03:29:03,632 --> 03:29:10,375
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not exclusively the people outside of this area hoping for this update in housing.

2446
03:29:10,615 --> 03:29:12,636
[SPEAKER_01]: So just wanted to clarify that.

2447
03:29:12,716 --> 03:29:12,976
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

2448
03:29:14,056 --> 03:29:14,597
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

2449
03:29:16,537 --> 03:29:20,559
[SPEAKER_47]: And before I come back to you, we haven't had anyone speak for a second time yet.

2450
03:29:20,679 --> 03:29:25,501
[SPEAKER_47]: Is there anyone else in person or on zoom who would like to speak for the first time?

2451
03:29:27,061 --> 03:29:28,082
[SPEAKER_47]: Please raise your hand now.

2452
03:29:32,115 --> 03:29:34,436
[SPEAKER_47]: All right, seeing none, we'll go to the podium for one minute.

2453
03:29:35,096 --> 03:29:36,356
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record, please.

2454
03:29:36,516 --> 03:29:38,637
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, Matthew Page Liman, 15 Canal Street.

2455
03:29:39,077 --> 03:29:40,278
[SPEAKER_26]: I just really appreciate it.

2456
03:29:40,358 --> 03:29:41,978
[SPEAKER_26]: Earlier, I talked about the Cunningham Law.

2457
03:29:42,438 --> 03:29:48,200
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think we did see quite a few instances of that when we say that nobody from the area supports this.

2458
03:29:48,280 --> 03:29:54,102
[SPEAKER_26]: And then all these addresses are cited people actually in the area that do want to see this development.

2459
03:29:55,742 --> 03:29:59,164
[SPEAKER_26]: I also, I'm not sure if I was clear earlier about community benefits.

2460
03:29:59,664 --> 03:30:07,408
[SPEAKER_26]: These community benefits can be used by the for profit developers to make sure that that area is more safe when people are very concerned about the danger.

2461
03:30:07,868 --> 03:30:10,369
[SPEAKER_26]: As far as this question about what is affordable housing.

2462
03:30:10,770 --> 03:30:15,432
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm in the Medford community land trust advisory group and we have these questions, what is affordable housing.

2463
03:30:15,752 --> 03:30:17,053
[SPEAKER_26]: what is low and median income.

2464
03:30:17,413 --> 03:30:21,997
[SPEAKER_26]: Affordable housing is quite frequently just cited as no more than 30% of one's income.

2465
03:30:22,377 --> 03:30:24,498
[SPEAKER_26]: So that really depends on how much somebody makes.

2466
03:30:24,719 --> 03:30:29,962
[SPEAKER_26]: However, low and median income, we could specify that as some percentage of area median income.

2467
03:30:30,323 --> 03:30:30,663
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

2468
03:30:30,743 --> 03:30:31,323
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

2469
03:30:31,343 --> 03:30:34,686
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm going to go for a second time to the podium.

2470
03:30:34,706 --> 03:30:35,566
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record.

2471
03:30:35,586 --> 03:30:36,167
[SPEAKER_47]: You have one minute.

2472
03:30:37,508 --> 03:30:39,790
[SPEAKER_13]: Ralph Klein, 172 Park Street in Medford.

2473
03:30:40,330 --> 03:30:44,333
[SPEAKER_13]: One thing you haven't addressed at all is the backs of these buildings.

2474
03:30:45,147 --> 03:30:49,910
[SPEAKER_13]: You go behind the new building on High Street and West Medford, look at the back of that building.

2475
03:30:50,711 --> 03:30:53,012
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what the residents of that area are going to look at.

2476
03:30:53,753 --> 03:30:58,836
[SPEAKER_13]: Look at the condo between Everett and Court Street, that ugly building.

2477
03:30:58,936 --> 03:30:59,957
[SPEAKER_13]: Look at the back of that building.

2478
03:30:59,977 --> 03:31:02,238
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what the residents of the street have to look at every day.

2479
03:31:02,258 --> 03:31:03,519
[SPEAKER_13]: They get out of their house and look at it.

2480
03:31:03,999 --> 03:31:06,481
[SPEAKER_13]: Go down Dudley Street, look at the one that's on Park Street.

2481
03:31:06,501 --> 03:31:07,682
[SPEAKER_13]: Look at the back of that building.

2482
03:31:08,282 --> 03:31:10,744
[SPEAKER_13]: You say, oh, we're going to make it look good for Salem Street.

2483
03:31:11,244 --> 03:31:13,686
[SPEAKER_13]: It's all right for me and the hell with all of you.

2484
03:31:14,785 --> 03:31:15,625
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what you're looking at.

2485
03:31:16,026 --> 03:31:16,886
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's what you're saying.

2486
03:31:17,546 --> 03:31:19,507
[SPEAKER_13]: Look at all these buildings and look at the proposals.

2487
03:31:21,688 --> 03:31:24,749
[SPEAKER_13]: In West Medford, they're saying, oh yeah, let's do it down Salem Street.

2488
03:31:24,829 --> 03:31:26,370
[SPEAKER_13]: It'll delay them coming to us.

2489
03:31:27,150 --> 03:31:29,431
[SPEAKER_13]: They have one building there that has nine luxury units.

2490
03:31:29,631 --> 03:31:32,793
[SPEAKER_13]: And you say affordable housing, where is that?

2491
03:31:33,813 --> 03:31:34,153
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

2492
03:31:34,193 --> 03:31:36,895
[SPEAKER_47]: All right.

2493
03:31:41,036 --> 03:31:42,437
[SPEAKER_47]: They've been addressed record of one minute.

2494
03:31:43,278 --> 03:31:44,839
[SPEAKER_42]: State Mayor, 373 Riverside Ave.

2495
03:31:45,479 --> 03:31:49,501
[SPEAKER_42]: Just a comment in terms of the benefits that this might bring.

2496
03:31:50,142 --> 03:31:51,082
[SPEAKER_42]: Yeah, we've heard that before.

2497
03:31:51,883 --> 03:31:55,945
[SPEAKER_42]: When they built what's now Windsor Place on the 61 Locust Street project, right?

2498
03:31:55,985 --> 03:31:57,986
[SPEAKER_42]: And Wegmans and all that, there was gonna be linkage.

2499
03:31:58,046 --> 03:31:59,567
[SPEAKER_42]: There was all these terms thrown around.

2500
03:31:59,587 --> 03:32:00,628
[SPEAKER_42]: It's gonna improve the area.

2501
03:32:02,008 --> 03:32:02,949
[SPEAKER_42]: My street still sucks.

2502
03:32:04,430 --> 03:32:08,212
[SPEAKER_42]: You drive down Riverside Ave, it's pothole city and it still sucks.

2503
03:32:08,792 --> 03:32:09,933
[SPEAKER_42]: So just,

2504
03:32:11,398 --> 03:32:11,999
[SPEAKER_42]: Be careful.

2505
03:32:12,399 --> 03:32:13,160
[SPEAKER_42]: It sounds good.

2506
03:32:14,281 --> 03:32:15,762
[SPEAKER_42]: Unintended consequences happen.

2507
03:32:17,283 --> 03:32:18,324
[SPEAKER_42]: Just consider this.

2508
03:32:19,445 --> 03:32:20,446
[SPEAKER_42]: Maybe take a little more time.

2509
03:32:20,907 --> 03:32:21,147
[SPEAKER_42]: Thanks.

2510
03:32:21,447 --> 03:32:21,928
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

2511
03:32:21,948 --> 03:32:25,891
[SPEAKER_47]: Lisa Serio.

2512
03:32:26,011 --> 03:32:27,653
[SPEAKER_47]: Lisa, you haven't spoken yet.

2513
03:32:28,794 --> 03:32:30,776
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record, please, Lisa.

2514
03:32:30,916 --> 03:32:31,657
[SPEAKER_47]: You have three minutes.

2515
03:32:32,660 --> 03:32:40,586
[SPEAKER_72]: Hi, my name is Lisa Sario, and I live at 19 Paul Road in Medford, and I'm not an abutter to the Haines Square area, Salem Street.

2516
03:32:41,246 --> 03:32:52,495
[SPEAKER_72]: But I just want, before you take the vote, I just want to say, I heard a city councilor once say, if the people in Medford aren't happy in Medford, why don't they move to another community?

2517
03:32:53,115 --> 03:32:59,660
[SPEAKER_72]: And I just want to say that I think that if you don't listen to the people who abut the area,

2518
03:33:00,473 --> 03:33:03,014
[SPEAKER_72]: then maybe you should move to another community.

2519
03:33:03,454 --> 03:33:06,615
[SPEAKER_72]: Because to me, their voices are very loud and clear.

2520
03:33:07,355 --> 03:33:15,138
[SPEAKER_72]: And I know when you take the vote, there is only one person that may have heard this, but the rest of you I know are going to vote yes.

2521
03:33:16,027 --> 03:33:25,995
[SPEAKER_72]: And it's going to be a shame that you didn't listen to all these people who spoke the truth about Medford, you know, who spoke what's really happening in Medford.

2522
03:33:26,556 --> 03:33:27,477
[SPEAKER_72]: We've all been here.

2523
03:33:27,797 --> 03:33:29,158
[SPEAKER_72]: We were here with the flare.

2524
03:33:29,498 --> 03:33:30,419
[SPEAKER_72]: It's a dead zone.

2525
03:33:30,819 --> 03:33:33,181
[SPEAKER_72]: We were here with Johnny's Foodmaster.

2526
03:33:33,502 --> 03:33:34,422
[SPEAKER_72]: We got Target now.

2527
03:33:34,583 --> 03:33:36,024
[SPEAKER_72]: Exactly what everybody said.

2528
03:33:36,064 --> 03:33:36,744
[SPEAKER_72]: That's the truth.

2529
03:33:36,784 --> 03:33:37,985
[SPEAKER_72]: We've watched changes.

2530
03:33:38,406 --> 03:33:39,206
[SPEAKER_72]: Some of them work.

2531
03:33:39,247 --> 03:33:39,987
[SPEAKER_72]: Some of them don't.

2532
03:33:40,668 --> 03:33:40,848
[SPEAKER_72]: But

2533
03:33:42,491 --> 03:33:48,454
[SPEAKER_72]: That's about the only thing I want to say is that if you don't listen to these people, then maybe you should move to another community.

2534
03:33:49,114 --> 03:33:49,515
[SPEAKER_72]: Thank you.

2535
03:33:49,535 --> 03:33:51,375
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

2536
03:33:51,395 --> 03:33:52,876
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm going to go to the podium.

2537
03:33:52,896 --> 03:33:54,197
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record.

2538
03:33:54,217 --> 03:33:54,837
[SPEAKER_47]: You have three minutes.

2539
03:33:56,927 --> 03:33:59,049
[SPEAKER_65]: Ellen Epstein, 15 Grove Street.

2540
03:33:59,289 --> 03:34:02,772
[SPEAKER_65]: And yes, I live in West Medford.

2541
03:34:03,473 --> 03:34:12,941
[SPEAKER_65]: And that's part of the reason why I'm here tonight, to support this proposal and to support good zoning regulations throughout the whole city.

2542
03:34:13,541 --> 03:34:19,126
[SPEAKER_65]: And when it comes time to look at West Medford, I will stand here again and speak in support.

2543
03:34:20,267 --> 03:34:25,971
[SPEAKER_65]: I think that we're forgetting that zoning regulations also protect.

2544
03:34:26,512 --> 03:34:33,658
[SPEAKER_65]: They don't only encourage new building, but having regulations in place, which we don't have now,

2545
03:34:34,734 --> 03:34:47,801
[SPEAKER_65]: will protect against, I'm sorry, I can't think of the word, but it'll protect us against things we don't want to happen as well as encourage things we do want to happen.

2546
03:34:47,861 --> 03:34:49,602
[SPEAKER_65]: So thank you for your work on this.

2547
03:34:49,782 --> 03:34:50,483
[SPEAKER_65]: I support it 100%.

2548
03:34:50,523 --> 03:34:50,923
[SPEAKER_65]: Thank you.

2549
03:34:50,983 --> 03:34:54,405
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm gonna go back to the Zoom.

2550
03:34:56,426 --> 03:34:57,627
[SPEAKER_47]: Carrie, you'll have one minute.

2551
03:35:01,409 --> 03:35:01,689
[SPEAKER_47]: Go ahead.

2552
03:35:02,780 --> 03:35:03,380
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, guys.

2553
03:35:03,400 --> 03:35:05,101
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to circle back.

2554
03:35:05,161 --> 03:35:11,103
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you heard from me earlier as someone who grew up on Power Street who will be directly affected.

2555
03:35:11,123 --> 03:35:16,545
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to zone in on what the day-to-day looks like in this area.

2556
03:35:16,805 --> 03:35:24,108
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is that Route 60 is directly impacted from the traffic from 93, but also the Felsway.

2557
03:35:24,569 --> 03:35:27,590
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a school that serves 600 students in this area.

2558
03:35:27,750 --> 03:35:30,191
[SPEAKER_08]: And as parents in this area, we all know

2559
03:35:31,151 --> 03:35:35,499
[SPEAKER_08]: That traffic line is a disaster for pickup, for drop-off, for all of us.

2560
03:35:35,679 --> 03:35:36,301
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a nightmare.

2561
03:35:37,417 --> 03:35:41,360
[SPEAKER_08]: We're also looking at a new facility going up in Malden.

2562
03:35:41,620 --> 03:35:47,704
[SPEAKER_08]: It is currently being built as a hospital in the area, which will increase traffic on Route 60.

2563
03:35:48,304 --> 03:35:49,966
[SPEAKER_08]: We do not have the infrastructure.

2564
03:35:50,346 --> 03:35:51,587
[SPEAKER_08]: Salem Street's a disaster.

2565
03:35:51,807 --> 03:36:00,453
[SPEAKER_08]: Pothole City, if you live here, you know you've popped a tire or got damage to your car's chassis and all that things on this area.

2566
03:36:00,913 --> 03:36:06,517
[SPEAKER_08]: So what I want you guys to think about is day-to-day traffic in this area is horrible.

2567
03:36:07,413 --> 03:36:26,100
[SPEAKER_08]: adding another potentially 25 units, even 25 units will directly impact the people who currently live here, the people who currently use the facilities that are in this area, Target, Ronnie's Place, the Silvestro's Barbers and things like that.

2568
03:36:26,180 --> 03:36:27,320
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much for your time.

2569
03:36:27,400 --> 03:36:30,301
[SPEAKER_08]: Please think about the direct impact of the people who are here.

2570
03:36:30,321 --> 03:36:31,682
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you, Carrie.

2571
03:36:39,215 --> 03:36:40,836
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record you have one minute.

2572
03:36:41,597 --> 03:36:45,360
[SPEAKER_37]: David McKenna to vine street also directly affected by this project.

2573
03:36:46,041 --> 03:36:57,110
[SPEAKER_37]: I just want to speak about the traffic I agree that traffic is out of control with the schools, and that is a direct result of the city not providing enough buses for families.

2574
03:36:58,472 --> 03:37:08,803
[SPEAKER_37]: within any reasonable distance of the school and so everyone does have to drive again this brings in new revenue to the city and the developers pay traffic impact fees, which could improve the buses.

2575
03:37:09,304 --> 03:37:14,069
[SPEAKER_37]: And if we offered school buses to more families that would directly cut down on the traffic.

2576
03:37:14,766 --> 03:37:17,789
[SPEAKER_37]: So there is a win-win possible here.

2577
03:37:19,751 --> 03:37:25,337
[SPEAKER_37]: Also, the former governor took away two of the express buses that ran down Salem Street.

2578
03:37:25,878 --> 03:37:34,527
[SPEAKER_37]: Again, with new revenue, we can revitalize our public transportation, which is already partially planned by the MBTA, but we could do more.

2579
03:37:35,107 --> 03:37:40,749
[SPEAKER_37]: Again, with more revenue so the traffic is a concern, but we have tools.

2580
03:37:41,550 --> 03:37:45,191
[SPEAKER_37]: We have more tools through this project than without it.

2581
03:37:45,391 --> 03:37:45,751
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

2582
03:37:45,831 --> 03:37:46,471
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you, Dave.

2583
03:37:48,532 --> 03:37:55,415
[SPEAKER_47]: All right, I got two emails to specifically requested that I read them into the record and then I'm going to declare this portion of the public hearing closed.

2584
03:37:56,545 --> 03:38:02,428
[SPEAKER_47]: We have Tina LaVoy, dear President Bears, I'm emailing you with my opposition of the current new zoning on Salem Street.

2585
03:38:02,508 --> 03:38:04,429
[SPEAKER_47]: I apologize, I'm having issue with my Zoom.

2586
03:38:04,449 --> 03:38:06,970
[SPEAKER_47]: I wanted to email you with my opposition.

2587
03:38:07,010 --> 03:38:09,752
[SPEAKER_47]: My name is Tina LaVoy, 128 Sheridan Ave, Medford.

2588
03:38:09,852 --> 03:38:10,292
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

2589
03:38:12,759 --> 03:38:14,380
[SPEAKER_47]: Then I had Nick Ulig.

2590
03:38:15,080 --> 03:38:16,081
[SPEAKER_47]: Hello, Councilors.

2591
03:38:16,581 --> 03:38:23,485
[SPEAKER_47]: In advance of tonight's Council meeting, which I will unfortunately not be able to attend, I wanted to voice my very strong support for the Salem Street zoning proposal.

2592
03:38:23,965 --> 03:38:27,267
[SPEAKER_47]: I'd like to request that Councilor Bears reads these comments into the record if possible.

2593
03:38:27,287 --> 03:38:31,910
[SPEAKER_47]: I moved to Medford last year and I live in the Salem Street corridor just a block away on Tainter Street.

2594
03:38:32,390 --> 03:38:37,031
[SPEAKER_47]: My family chose Medford for its schools, parks, friendly neighborhoods, and good mix of urban forms.

2595
03:38:37,191 --> 03:38:43,553
[SPEAKER_47]: We love the lively character of Medford Square and High Street, but also the quieter tree-lined streets in historic districts.

2596
03:38:44,093 --> 03:38:51,395
[SPEAKER_47]: We want to see Medford continue to develop while maintaining its unique charm, and this means incremental densification on streets just like Salem.

2597
03:38:52,115 --> 03:38:57,056
[SPEAKER_47]: We moved here from a city which, while very dense, is experiencing its own housing crisis, Toronto, Ontario.

2598
03:38:57,617 --> 03:39:03,698
[SPEAKER_47]: That city has been plagued for years by setbacks, resistance, foot-dragging, and political whiplash concerning building new housing and transit.

2599
03:39:04,318 --> 03:39:11,500
[SPEAKER_47]: It is finally making progress on this front, and I want to see our new home of Medford avoid the decades of delays caused by this irrational resistance to change.

2600
03:39:12,140 --> 03:39:17,062
[SPEAKER_47]: I encourage Medford City Council to act boldly and say yes to more density today, not 20 years from now.

2601
03:39:17,822 --> 03:39:19,023
[SPEAKER_47]: Some things I want to highlight.

2602
03:39:19,303 --> 03:39:28,430
[SPEAKER_47]: One, Salem Street is perfectly positioned to add density to coincide with its improved transit corridor as part of the MBTA Better Bus Program and the changes to Routes 101 and 96.

2603
03:39:29,571 --> 03:39:34,715
[SPEAKER_47]: Reduced parking, greater density, and more variety in the mix of homes and businesses on the street is what we need.

2604
03:39:35,852 --> 03:39:41,953
[SPEAKER_47]: Two, the CD board's disappointing attempt to water down the proposal by removing the density node at Park Street is unnecessary.

2605
03:39:42,473 --> 03:39:44,694
[SPEAKER_47]: The MX2 zoning should be restored for this node.

2606
03:39:45,014 --> 03:39:48,755
[SPEAKER_47]: One visible reason is the unsightly open pit that has been present there for a long time.

2607
03:39:49,335 --> 03:39:53,056
[SPEAKER_47]: The more options available to develop that land, the better and the faster it will get done.

2608
03:39:53,696 --> 03:39:56,677
[SPEAKER_47]: The same goes for adjacent lots as they come up for redevelopment in the future.

2609
03:39:57,297 --> 03:40:02,398
[SPEAKER_47]: Artificially restricting density is not the way to address housing needs or the desire for a vibrant and walkable community.

2610
03:40:02,938 --> 03:40:11,417
[SPEAKER_47]: the community development board went too far in scaling back this proposal and the original proposal for mx2 zoning for the park street node should be approved three

2611
03:40:12,038 --> 03:40:17,900
[SPEAKER_47]: In parallel with the proposed rezoning, the Council must enable these rezoning initiatives to succeed by removing parking minimums citywide.

2612
03:40:18,480 --> 03:40:33,005
[SPEAKER_47]: A previous hometown of mine, Edmonton, Alberta, a notoriously car-dependent city, boldly removed not only all exclusionary single-family district zoning, but also all parking minimums several years ago to enable its goal of pushing infill development and avoiding further urban sprawl.

2613
03:40:33,685 --> 03:40:37,228
[SPEAKER_47]: These two measures have fundamentally changed the development patterns of the city for the better.

2614
03:40:37,748 --> 03:40:39,649
[SPEAKER_47]: This is exactly what we need to do in Medford.

2615
03:40:40,110 --> 03:40:45,673
[SPEAKER_47]: Parking minimums are an outdated policy measure that encourage unsustainable development and get in the way of building the housing we need.

2616
03:40:46,354 --> 03:40:49,016
[SPEAKER_47]: My thanks for the hard work you do to make Medford the best it can be.

2617
03:40:49,176 --> 03:40:54,019
[SPEAKER_47]: I look forward to more neighbors, more vibrancy, and more things that make Medford a great place to live.

2618
03:40:54,619 --> 03:40:58,442
[SPEAKER_47]: Enthusiastically, Nicholas Ullig, 62 Taylor Street, Medford, MA 02155.

2619
03:41:02,060 --> 03:41:05,803
[SPEAKER_47]: With that, I'm declaring this portion of the public hearing closed.

2620
03:41:13,330 --> 03:41:21,117
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm going to now recognize Council Vice President Collins, Vice President Collins, and then Councilor Leming and then Councilor Sanders.

2621
03:41:22,873 --> 03:41:23,695
[SPEAKER_52]: Thank you, President Bears.

2622
03:41:23,735 --> 03:41:29,868
[SPEAKER_52]: And before I begin, I want to say thank you to every person who attended and spoke and shared your perspective with us.

2623
03:41:29,888 --> 03:41:33,416
[SPEAKER_52]: I know it takes a lot to spend your evenings this way, and it's really appreciated.

2624
03:41:35,080 --> 03:41:48,270
[SPEAKER_52]: Not everybody will feel represented by this, but in listening to public comment over the past few hours I noted that many speakers, even when they were here to explain why they were not in favor of this proposal, affirmed that they agree that zoning in principle is needed.

2625
03:41:49,251 --> 03:41:56,196
[SPEAKER_52]: We also heard a lot about concerns about problems that zoning may worsen, or that zoning will not help us to make progress on.

2626
03:41:57,357 --> 03:42:02,439
[SPEAKER_52]: I again want to quickly restate and affirm that changing zoning is not the same as flipping a switch.

2627
03:42:03,179 --> 03:42:05,200
[SPEAKER_52]: Some lots may be developed very quickly.

2628
03:42:05,980 --> 03:42:06,641
[SPEAKER_52]: Many will not.

2629
03:42:07,141 --> 03:42:07,961
[SPEAKER_52]: Many will take years.

2630
03:42:08,281 --> 03:42:10,182
[SPEAKER_52]: This is a long-term plan.

2631
03:42:12,743 --> 03:42:17,905
[SPEAKER_52]: As we deliberate, I urge my colleagues and my fellow community members to not mistake standing still for moving forward.

2632
03:42:19,225 --> 03:42:22,387
[SPEAKER_52]: And I want to make really clear that neglecting to rezone for the 21st century

2633
03:42:23,629 --> 03:42:50,238
[SPEAKER_52]: will not allow us to improve parking enforcement, slow traffic, get cars off the road, improve sidewalks, improve crosswalks, improve infrastructure capacity, prevent businesses from getting displaced due to escalating commercial rents, prevent people from getting displaced due to escalating residential rents, make it easier to buy homes in Medford, improve heat islands or pollution, or force the MBTA to speed up the bus network redesign rollout.

2634
03:42:51,199 --> 03:42:52,079
[SPEAKER_52]: Zoning alone

2635
03:42:53,067 --> 03:42:54,163
[SPEAKER_52]: will fix none of these things.

2636
03:42:55,037 --> 03:42:57,317
[SPEAKER_52]: zoning is one part of a multi-part strategy.

2637
03:42:58,098 --> 03:43:22,922
[SPEAKER_52]: It must fit in with, and it does fit in with, linkage fees, impact fees, increasing our school capacity, improving our water and sewer infrastructure, improving our roads, holding electricity utilities accountable, expanding our tree canopy, holding developers to higher environmental standards citywide, making it easier for businesses to find a home in Medford, traffic calming, road improvements, holding the DOT and the DCR accountable to making state roads safer,

2638
03:43:24,162 --> 03:43:26,443
[SPEAKER_52]: All of these projects are currently underway.

2639
03:43:27,323 --> 03:43:38,746
[SPEAKER_52]: They occur parallel to the zoning effort at the same time as we contemplate rezoning and stopping a decades overdue zoning project will not help any of these projects that are occurring in tandem.

2640
03:43:39,406 --> 03:43:41,486
[SPEAKER_52]: They're also towards goals that I believe we all share.

2641
03:43:42,626 --> 03:43:44,387
[SPEAKER_52]: It will much more likely help us.

2642
03:43:45,587 --> 03:43:53,089
[SPEAKER_52]: I know a lot of people have tonight talked about the revenue that we will enjoy because of uptoning through permitting fees and for new growth.

2643
03:43:54,495 --> 03:43:58,857
[SPEAKER_52]: That is not the reason that we zone, or at least it's not the reason that I come to the zoning effort.

2644
03:43:59,677 --> 03:44:01,878
[SPEAKER_52]: I think that that's true for most people.

2645
03:44:01,918 --> 03:44:03,199
[SPEAKER_52]: We don't zone because of the revenue.

2646
03:44:03,839 --> 03:44:16,404
[SPEAKER_52]: But it is true that the development will raise our commercial tax base and help us pay for the things that we know we need, many of the things that were mentioned tonight, from infrastructure improvements to paying our public workers better,

2647
03:44:16,837 --> 03:44:24,303
[SPEAKER_52]: and attracting great new workers to City Hall, to stump removal and planting trees and parking enforcement, and being able to fund more school buses.

2648
03:44:24,724 --> 03:44:27,366
[SPEAKER_52]: We need funding to do these things, and this will help.

2649
03:44:27,386 --> 03:44:31,990
[SPEAKER_52]: I also want to touch again on studies because those were talked about a lot tonight.

2650
03:44:33,817 --> 03:44:39,059
[SPEAKER_52]: Not to be repetitive, but site plan review process and special permit process is governed by state law.

2651
03:44:39,719 --> 03:44:41,280
[SPEAKER_52]: Direct debuttors are always notified.

2652
03:44:41,800 --> 03:44:43,521
[SPEAKER_52]: These projects appear on public agendas.

2653
03:44:44,001 --> 03:44:48,883
[SPEAKER_52]: They're reviewed in public meetings of the ZBA, the CDB, or the city council, depending on the project.

2654
03:44:50,283 --> 03:44:54,685
[SPEAKER_52]: Impact studies such as traffic impacts reviewed by police and fire safety inspections.

2655
03:44:55,285 --> 03:44:55,726
[SPEAKER_52]: These are done.

2656
03:44:56,666 --> 03:45:04,370
[SPEAKER_52]: It is current practice for developers to take on the cost of their studies, which are then reviewed by city staff, including our public safety officials, boards and commissions.

2657
03:45:05,450 --> 03:45:10,112
[SPEAKER_52]: They are done on a project by project basis because that is the point of decision for the city and the community.

2658
03:45:10,552 --> 03:45:13,794
[SPEAKER_52]: A traffic study done in 2024 would not be useful nation.

2659
03:45:14,214 --> 03:45:23,317
[SPEAKER_52]: useful information when in 2020, sorry, would not be useful information when, for example, in 2034, a developer might want to develop on Salem Street.

2660
03:45:23,717 --> 03:45:35,520
[SPEAKER_52]: It would not be useful information for when we are negotiating with that developer for what parking and traffic mitigation they are going to do then to address the traffic patterns, congestion level, and parking needs for that development at that point in time.

2661
03:45:37,160 --> 03:45:40,361
[SPEAKER_52]: And finally, regarding gentrification and displacement.

2662
03:45:41,142 --> 03:45:42,522
[SPEAKER_52]: The displacement that people are

2663
03:45:43,942 --> 03:45:50,365
[SPEAKER_52]: so afraid of and offended by and saddened by is already happening commercially and residentially.

2664
03:45:51,586 --> 03:45:54,207
[SPEAKER_52]: Refusing change is not a solution to gentrification.

2665
03:45:54,227 --> 03:45:59,170
[SPEAKER_52]: The solution to increasing housing stock, the solution is increasing housing stock.

2666
03:45:59,850 --> 03:46:18,338
[SPEAKER_52]: while expanding public housing, while growing our affordable housing trust portfolio, while considering a residential property tax exemption, while doing first-time homebuyer support, while pursuing rent stabilization, because otherwise there is no backstop in the world that will prevent out-of-town corporate landlords from cheating tenants like numbers on a spreadsheet.

2667
03:46:19,058 --> 03:46:23,500
[SPEAKER_52]: It would be wishful thinking to say that rezoning is a panacea for housing affordability.

2668
03:46:23,940 --> 03:46:25,661
[SPEAKER_52]: That is why nobody behind this rail has said that.

2669
03:46:26,341 --> 03:46:28,743
[SPEAKER_52]: This is one piece of the puzzle.

2670
03:46:29,303 --> 03:46:32,524
[SPEAKER_52]: It is not our only strategy for increasing affordable housing.

2671
03:46:33,165 --> 03:46:41,569
[SPEAKER_52]: And to all those who are upset that this proposal is not bullish enough on affordable housing, I would welcome your partnership with this council on any and all of those other strategies.

2672
03:46:42,169 --> 03:46:44,350
[SPEAKER_52]: Thank you, and I look forward to the discussion with my fellow councilors.

2673
03:46:48,270 --> 03:46:50,051
[SPEAKER_47]: Vice President Collins, Councilor Lemme.

2674
03:46:52,673 --> 03:46:53,053
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you.

2675
03:46:55,854 --> 03:47:03,158
[SPEAKER_41]: Phrase that I've been thinking about a lot throughout the zoning process is think globally, act locally.

2676
03:47:04,771 --> 03:47:13,854
[SPEAKER_41]: Throughout this process, the consultants, the elected officials, city staff have had public meetings.

2677
03:47:14,214 --> 03:47:16,015
[SPEAKER_41]: They have taken feedback from residents.

2678
03:47:17,795 --> 03:47:29,339
[SPEAKER_41]: And when they can't implement that feedback, we've offered fact-based explanations repeatedly of why we may or may not be able to do something.

2679
03:47:30,532 --> 03:47:41,578
[SPEAKER_41]: This entire process was done not only with years worth of feedback from the entire community that was painstakingly collected, this is only the execution phase right now.

2680
03:47:41,598 --> 03:47:42,998
[SPEAKER_41]: It was

2681
03:47:51,670 --> 03:48:08,865
[SPEAKER_41]: point that I'm getting at is that if I did honestly believe that addressing some of the concerns that were brought up tonight, some of the changing concerns that have continued to hear over the past couple of months, then

2682
03:48:10,046 --> 03:48:16,312
[SPEAKER_41]: And I believe that that would get more folks on the side of rezoning, then I would then I would support that.

2683
03:48:16,593 --> 03:48:19,796
[SPEAKER_41]: But I think that if a traffic study were done it would be something else.

2684
03:48:20,436 --> 03:48:25,301
[SPEAKER_41]: And at the end of the day, you know, a lot of folks are just uncomfortable with, with the idea of change, and

2685
03:48:25,781 --> 03:48:29,425
[SPEAKER_41]: Anytime you have any sort of rezoning process that happens.

2686
03:48:29,946 --> 03:48:35,171
[SPEAKER_41]: This is not just a Medford thing, you can see that neighboring communities, you can see that anywhere you go.

2687
03:48:35,471 --> 03:48:36,372
[SPEAKER_41]: And what's interesting.

2688
03:48:37,073 --> 03:48:40,216
[SPEAKER_41]: What's what's always will strange to me is that anytime.

2689
03:48:42,717 --> 03:48:46,318
[SPEAKER_41]: residents talk, they speak about what they don't like about a neighborhood.

2690
03:48:46,358 --> 03:48:52,480
[SPEAKER_41]: They speak about, you know, things that they oppose, but it's rarely ever, what do I want to see happen instead?

2691
03:48:52,520 --> 03:48:55,240
[SPEAKER_41]: It's rarely ever an alternative solution.

2692
03:48:57,401 --> 03:49:07,943
[SPEAKER_41]: And, you know, we're not going to solve any of the problems, any of the many challenges that Medford faces by doing nothing, by more delays.

2693
03:49:08,023 --> 03:49:10,064
[SPEAKER_41]: This has been delayed for decades already.

2694
03:49:11,067 --> 03:49:14,689
[SPEAKER_41]: All right, and that's something that people really need to understand.

2695
03:49:14,749 --> 03:49:23,954
[SPEAKER_41]: This council is the first one that is really trying to do something for the benefit of the city instead of just offering rhetoric.

2696
03:49:24,894 --> 03:49:37,161
[SPEAKER_41]: So, frankly, I think that throughout this process, as was echoed by a lot of folks in the public comment process, we already did quite a bit to water down this proposal from what it was.

2697
03:49:37,221 --> 03:49:39,222
[SPEAKER_41]: Frankly, I think that if we did,

2698
03:49:40,183 --> 03:49:45,468
[SPEAKER_41]: the feasibility studies that many people have been asking, the engineers would say that we could build like 10 stories on Salem Street.

2699
03:49:45,688 --> 03:49:51,433
[SPEAKER_41]: All right, so it's already a fairly modest proposal, all things considered as is.

2700
03:49:52,994 --> 03:50:06,466
[SPEAKER_41]: So all that being said, because I do think it has been watered down, I'm gonna motion to revert the intersection between Salem and Park Street from MX1 back to MX2.

2701
03:50:10,804 --> 03:50:20,227
[SPEAKER_47]: There's a motion to amend the proposal to revert the Salem and Park intersection from MX1 back to the MX2 in the original proposal by Councilor Leming.

2702
03:50:22,728 --> 03:50:25,689
[SPEAKER_47]: Is there a second on that amendment?

2703
03:50:29,931 --> 03:50:31,191
[SPEAKER_47]: Seconded by Councilor Tseng.

2704
03:50:32,832 --> 03:50:36,773
[SPEAKER_47]: We'll take a vote on that and then we'll take a vote on the

2705
03:50:38,071 --> 03:50:41,554
[SPEAKER_47]: proposal as amended, but I do want to go to Councilor Tseng.

2706
03:50:43,255 --> 03:50:43,675
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

2707
03:50:44,176 --> 03:50:52,482
[SPEAKER_35]: I've been diligently taking notes throughout this whole whole meeting about what people have been saying, the arguments for and against the concerns that residents have.

2708
03:50:53,383 --> 03:50:58,267
[SPEAKER_35]: So pardon me if I take a bit because there's just a lot on the stage.

2709
03:51:00,048 --> 03:51:04,352
[SPEAKER_35]: I want to situate us in the process, the greater zoning process first.

2710
03:51:05,418 --> 03:51:19,568
[SPEAKER_35]: This is a part of a large rezoning project that seeks to transform how our city approaches affordability, how our city approaches business growth, and makes our city a more thriving, livable place.

2711
03:51:20,508 --> 03:51:29,254
[SPEAKER_35]: We started this process, we did phase one during the last term, where we started out with basic changes, technical changes mostly.

2712
03:51:30,335 --> 03:51:34,218
[SPEAKER_35]: We've passed a Mystic Avenue rezoning,

2713
03:51:35,441 --> 03:51:39,204
[SPEAKER_35]: plan earlier in this term in December, as was noted before.

2714
03:51:40,905 --> 03:51:54,454
[SPEAKER_35]: And this is the culmination of years and years of public participation and feedback of community engagement, especially reaching out to communities that don't always get their say.

2715
03:51:55,395 --> 03:52:04,601
[SPEAKER_35]: And we see those ideas contained in our city's comprehensive plan, in our housing production plan, and in the climate action and adaptation plan.

2716
03:52:06,665 --> 03:52:21,186
[SPEAKER_35]: You know, I think the public feedback part is important, and I have been really grateful that we've done more during the Salem Street project than before, you know, we held information sessions we heard from the public.

2717
03:52:22,718 --> 03:52:44,282
[SPEAKER_35]: And like the changes that are not, NS Associates did respond to feedback and they made adjustments to things like medical definitions, the hotels, they added more regulations to make sure that the rear setbacks are better for lighting in the neighborhood and for curb appeal as well.

2718
03:52:45,324 --> 03:52:50,565
[SPEAKER_35]: So that public engagement process I think is really important to note here tonight.

2719
03:52:52,266 --> 03:53:04,789
[SPEAKER_35]: You know this isn't also also really important to note that this isn't the only neighborhood that we're working on, that there's a incremental that we're seeking incremental increases across the board making sure that all neighborhoods

2720
03:53:05,670 --> 03:53:11,195
[SPEAKER_35]: are participating and contributing to our solution to the housing crisis here.

2721
03:53:11,775 --> 03:53:21,224
[SPEAKER_35]: And, you know, I think to also mention in that grand scheme of things is that we have side projects meant to address a lot of concerns that people brought tonight.

2722
03:53:21,284 --> 03:53:28,511
[SPEAKER_35]: For example, I know that we've communicated with the Planning Development Sustainability Office and Innes Associates

2723
03:53:29,310 --> 03:53:35,034
[SPEAKER_35]: about traffic demand management, which could help us a lot when it comes to the traffic problem.

2724
03:53:36,615 --> 03:53:49,345
[SPEAKER_35]: This reform also closes loopholes that would that allow us to build the equivalent of 15 story buildings and actually aligns us much more with what is currently informed in the neighborhood.

2725
03:53:50,148 --> 03:53:56,251
[SPEAKER_35]: Now, there's so many reasons to consider with regards to this project.

2726
03:53:57,192 --> 03:54:01,054
[SPEAKER_35]: And for me, at the core is the problem of affordability.

2727
03:54:01,574 --> 03:54:05,096
[SPEAKER_35]: Now, I'm someone who is young, that's evident.

2728
03:54:05,156 --> 03:54:07,137
[SPEAKER_35]: I think people made a point of that a lot.

2729
03:54:08,618 --> 03:54:09,879
[SPEAKER_35]: And I'd like to say I'm Medford.

2730
03:54:11,300 --> 03:54:15,282
[SPEAKER_35]: I feel like I've contributed a fair share to this community.

2731
03:54:15,482 --> 03:54:17,223
[SPEAKER_35]: My family lives here, my friends live here.

2732
03:54:18,295 --> 03:54:21,836
[SPEAKER_35]: my support network is here, my shopping is here, you know, I do my grocery runs here.

2733
03:54:22,956 --> 03:54:23,996
[SPEAKER_35]: I have my appointments here.

2734
03:54:24,576 --> 03:54:26,036
[SPEAKER_35]: And I want to be able to stay here.

2735
03:54:26,556 --> 03:54:31,717
[SPEAKER_35]: But that prospect is threatened by the state of the cost of living crisis nowadays.

2736
03:54:32,157 --> 03:54:34,578
[SPEAKER_35]: It's threatened by the housing crisis as well.

2737
03:54:35,018 --> 03:54:36,498
[SPEAKER_35]: And we've it's not just me, right?

2738
03:54:36,678 --> 03:54:46,860
[SPEAKER_35]: We've heard time and time again, from residents whose doors were knocking from participants, public participants at this podium, about how

2739
03:54:47,695 --> 03:54:54,139
[SPEAKER_35]: They want to stay here, they want their family to stay here, they have cousins or aunts and uncles who also are feeling the pressure.

2740
03:54:54,719 --> 03:55:04,785
[SPEAKER_35]: And, you know, I think it shouldn't go unnoticed that many of those folks who can't afford the privilege of being here at this meeting are the ones who feel it the hardest.

2741
03:55:05,986 --> 03:55:09,330
[SPEAKER_35]: And, you know, this affordability crisis extends further to.

2742
03:55:10,451 --> 03:55:23,947
[SPEAKER_35]: It's according to studies, the main reason why people are moving out of Massachusetts and why Massachusetts isn't reaching the economic growth that we want to be seeing because we're not maximizing the potential of people being able to live close to their jobs.

2743
03:55:25,526 --> 03:55:29,607
[SPEAKER_35]: We are not recognizing that people want diversity in housing options.

2744
03:55:29,687 --> 03:55:34,689
[SPEAKER_35]: I know this is really surprising, maybe really surprising to older folks, but I think this is a great example.

2745
03:55:34,789 --> 03:55:42,672
[SPEAKER_35]: I was at a PowerPoint night a few weeks ago where we were designing or we were identifying dream homes for people.

2746
03:55:43,172 --> 03:55:46,313
[SPEAKER_35]: And a number of those homes, at least a third of those homes were apartments.

2747
03:55:46,913 --> 03:55:48,534
[SPEAKER_35]: And that's a generational change.

2748
03:55:48,614 --> 03:55:51,895
[SPEAKER_35]: And that's a generational change that we have to account for in urban planning as well.

2749
03:55:53,080 --> 03:56:09,271
[SPEAKER_35]: It's also really important to note that this zoning reform not only has affordable housing requirements, it actually strengthens those requirements by creating a really innovative dual track system where there are different tracks that you can take for incentives.

2750
03:56:09,311 --> 03:56:13,553
[SPEAKER_35]: For example, you can believe it's 80% of area median income and 15% of area or 65% of area median income where

2751
03:56:22,180 --> 03:56:32,786
[SPEAKER_35]: someone choosing to build can choose one of those tracks, and that broadens affordability for more people who've traditionally been just on the cusp of getting affordable housing but not enough to qualify.

2752
03:56:33,426 --> 03:56:36,588
[SPEAKER_35]: And that's really important as well, and we're incentivizing that in this plan.

2753
03:56:38,344 --> 03:56:43,009
[SPEAKER_35]: I've heard the used car analogy from Miss Cameron and I actually think that's very apt.

2754
03:56:43,629 --> 03:56:59,826
[SPEAKER_35]: I understand the concern that maybe a lot of the units that will be built are luxury units but I think we think back to that analogy and the economics research has been super clear that even when you do build luxury housing, not that that's our preference, but even when you do that,

2755
03:57:00,957 --> 03:57:10,380
[SPEAKER_35]: people who can afford that choose the better housing, right, or they choose luxury housing, so they move out of the market for people who need normal housing.

2756
03:57:10,860 --> 03:57:15,142
[SPEAKER_35]: And I think that's something that data has shown time and time again this decade.

2757
03:57:15,802 --> 03:57:24,545
[SPEAKER_35]: And speaking about data, it's really important to look at the success stories in our country where housing has gotten more affordable, where people have been able to stay.

2758
03:57:25,263 --> 03:57:35,146
[SPEAKER_35]: I think Minneapolis is the best example of that, but there are multiple examples around this country where, you know, cities have kept housing, regions have kept housing prices down.

2759
03:57:35,586 --> 03:57:42,969
[SPEAKER_35]: Every single one of them dramatically increases affordable units or housing units in general, even more than what we see here today.

2760
03:57:45,090 --> 03:57:47,352
[SPEAKER_35]: I believe that this is good for business growth as well.

2761
03:57:48,212 --> 03:57:59,480
[SPEAKER_35]: I've talked to people looking to open businesses in Medford, and a huge concern that they bring up is the lack of a consumer base that lives close to where they would open their shops.

2762
03:58:00,100 --> 03:58:02,342
[SPEAKER_35]: I think that's something that we really have to consider.

2763
03:58:02,942 --> 03:58:06,004
[SPEAKER_35]: Now, it'd be great, too, to get cafes and entertainment.

2764
03:58:07,792 --> 03:58:13,757
[SPEAKER_35]: I've heard, we've heard a lot about grocery stores to hopefully solve our food desert-like problem.

2765
03:58:14,297 --> 03:58:28,449
[SPEAKER_35]: And I truly believe that folks who need food close to them and at a walkable distance will appreciate that this zoning law gives us the ability to open up that option for them.

2766
03:58:29,630 --> 03:58:31,512
[SPEAKER_35]: Understand, you know, people

2767
03:58:32,452 --> 03:58:35,074
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm upset that Johnny's Foodmaster isn't there anymore.

2768
03:58:35,094 --> 03:58:36,555
[SPEAKER_35]: I used to go there too when I was growing up.

2769
03:58:36,975 --> 03:58:41,978
[SPEAKER_35]: But government doesn't control whether a supermarket remains open or not.

2770
03:58:42,538 --> 03:58:46,581
[SPEAKER_35]: But we can control where food is available to our residents.

2771
03:58:49,116 --> 03:58:53,757
[SPEAKER_35]: This, I believe the zoning plan would put us on a path to more financial stability.

2772
03:58:54,218 --> 03:59:12,882
[SPEAKER_35]: We've heard a lot about how this will grow, you know, not that this is the goal, but it will grow our revenue base, it will increase investment in our city, in our city services, which in turn, we can use that fund to make safer streets, to have better city services,

2773
03:59:13,783 --> 03:59:19,448
[SPEAKER_35]: impact fees and studies and the fees that cover those will really help our city, in my opinion.

2774
03:59:19,969 --> 03:59:24,473
[SPEAKER_35]: When it comes to walkability, even though it isn't walkable right now, it doesn't mean it can't be.

2775
03:59:25,034 --> 03:59:32,942
[SPEAKER_35]: And it is really important too to note that with this whole, you know, environmental walkability traffic point that

2776
03:59:33,682 --> 03:59:41,955
[SPEAKER_35]: The young people who we are targeting, the young people who we want to be able to stay in Medford, a huge bulk of them don't own cars and choose not to own cars.

2777
03:59:42,596 --> 03:59:45,660
[SPEAKER_35]: The car ownership rates with people my generation are down over 25%.

2778
03:59:45,700 --> 03:59:46,041
[SPEAKER_35]: That's a choice.

2779
03:59:50,717 --> 03:59:59,482
[SPEAKER_35]: This zoning plan implements better energy efficiency standards and incentives to reach those standards.

2780
03:59:59,502 --> 04:00:01,984
[SPEAKER_35]: 70% of our emissions in the city come from buildings and houses.

2781
04:00:02,664 --> 04:00:07,988
[SPEAKER_35]: And studies again have shown time and time again, the way to reduce those emissions is to build denser housing.

2782
04:00:08,628 --> 04:00:14,952
[SPEAKER_35]: And we can argue over what density is right, but that is the science.

2783
04:00:15,152 --> 04:00:16,393
[SPEAKER_35]: So we have to account for that.

2784
04:00:17,254 --> 04:00:17,694
[SPEAKER_35]: Furthermore,

2785
04:00:18,628 --> 04:00:38,793
[SPEAKER_35]: when it comes to the traffic point, in maybe even a year, but at least two or three years, the MBTA will be running the 96 bus down and up this corridor during rush hours at a peak time of seven minutes, and even off rush hour within 15 minutes, I believe.

2786
04:00:38,853 --> 04:00:44,455
[SPEAKER_35]: And that's gonna provide connections to the red line, to the orange line, and to the D and E lines of the Green Line Express.

2787
04:00:46,480 --> 04:00:53,186
[SPEAKER_35]: The science shows that when you up zone like this, trip rates go down because life gets more convenient.

2788
04:00:53,286 --> 04:00:54,207
[SPEAKER_35]: People choose to walk.

2789
04:00:54,567 --> 04:00:56,408
[SPEAKER_35]: People choose to walk to things that are close to them.

2790
04:00:59,491 --> 04:01:03,374
[SPEAKER_35]: There's lots to say with regards to accessibility.

2791
04:01:04,215 --> 04:01:13,123
[SPEAKER_35]: I think a resident wrote me and was very compelling about how actually three or four story buildings aren't enough because there aren't, you know, people don't build elevators for those buildings.

2792
04:01:13,623 --> 04:01:20,885
[SPEAKER_35]: But anything over that level, people will build elevators for them, which means that people who can't get around easily will have a place to live.

2793
04:01:21,485 --> 04:01:24,226
[SPEAKER_35]: And I think that's something to consider as well.

2794
04:01:25,387 --> 04:01:36,630
[SPEAKER_35]: In fact, if you prevent walkability, if you make this less walkable, it is more restrictive and keeps folks stuck in their homes as well.

2795
04:01:36,650 --> 04:01:41,232
[SPEAKER_35]: And that's something that we're looking at with the transportation task force.

2796
04:01:42,581 --> 04:01:45,964
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm going on way too long, but I just want to end with this.

2797
04:01:46,624 --> 04:01:55,231
[SPEAKER_35]: This is a regional issue, I hear that you know there are residents who really do support this, who live nearby and residents who don't support this and live nearby as well.

2798
04:01:56,312 --> 04:01:57,933
[SPEAKER_35]: But we all have stakes in this issue.

2799
04:01:58,474 --> 04:02:03,678
[SPEAKER_35]: This is a regional issue we're all you know we are all affected by the lack of housing in one area.

2800
04:02:05,493 --> 04:02:08,777
[SPEAKER_35]: And we're all affected by the lack of housing in Medford as a whole.

2801
04:02:09,198 --> 04:02:11,761
[SPEAKER_35]: And so it does make sense for all of us to be commenting on this.

2802
04:02:12,102 --> 04:02:12,462
[SPEAKER_35]: In fact,

2803
04:02:13,310 --> 04:02:18,072
[SPEAKER_35]: You know, if you don't like this, you should go to Wayland.

2804
04:02:18,272 --> 04:02:19,772
[SPEAKER_35]: You should go to Acton.

2805
04:02:19,953 --> 04:02:21,273
[SPEAKER_35]: You should go to Haverhill.

2806
04:02:21,673 --> 04:02:29,056
[SPEAKER_35]: You should go to those communities and ask them to build more housing as well, because that's going to help us reach our regional goal.

2807
04:02:29,596 --> 04:02:42,361
[SPEAKER_35]: I find any comment asking people to move away because they don't like something despicable, but I have to note that the context in which we heard that tonight was asking young people who can't afford to live here to move away.

2808
04:02:42,943 --> 04:02:45,725
[SPEAKER_35]: And I think that's really important to note as well.

2809
04:02:46,066 --> 04:02:47,627
[SPEAKER_35]: We want young people to be able to stay.

2810
04:02:47,667 --> 04:02:49,188
[SPEAKER_35]: We want all people to be able to stay.

2811
04:02:49,649 --> 04:02:52,771
[SPEAKER_35]: And not addressing the housing crisis pushes all people out.

2812
04:02:52,811 --> 04:02:53,872
[SPEAKER_35]: It pushes young people out.

2813
04:02:54,252 --> 04:02:55,233
[SPEAKER_35]: I've talked about that here.

2814
04:02:55,774 --> 04:02:57,555
[SPEAKER_35]: But it also pushes old people out.

2815
04:02:57,595 --> 04:02:58,996
[SPEAKER_35]: It pushes middle-aged people out.

2816
04:02:59,016 --> 04:03:00,097
[SPEAKER_35]: It pushes families out.

2817
04:03:01,318 --> 04:03:06,843
[SPEAKER_35]: And that's something that we have to consider as well.

2818
04:03:07,223 --> 04:03:09,205
[SPEAKER_35]: I do actually hear a lot of these concerns.

2819
04:03:09,285 --> 04:03:12,007
[SPEAKER_35]: I think a lot of the concerns can be addressed in the future.

2820
04:03:13,163 --> 04:03:15,924
[SPEAKER_35]: with greater resources, greater revenue.

2821
04:03:16,345 --> 04:03:36,113
[SPEAKER_35]: But ultimately, I think what I have to say is that I got elected on a platform to increase housing, to invest in our communities, to work on environmental standards and raising those, and to make our city centers more lively and thriving.

2822
04:03:36,613 --> 04:03:38,934
[SPEAKER_35]: And it would betray my platform to vote against this.

2823
04:03:40,095 --> 04:03:40,495
[SPEAKER_35]: We can't,

2824
04:03:41,596 --> 04:03:43,176
[SPEAKER_35]: help kicking this down the road.

2825
04:03:43,677 --> 04:03:45,177
[SPEAKER_35]: We can't keep kicking this down the road.

2826
04:03:45,197 --> 04:03:47,958
[SPEAKER_35]: I think if not us, then who?

2827
04:03:48,478 --> 04:03:49,478
[SPEAKER_35]: If not now, then when?

2828
04:03:50,298 --> 04:03:51,618
[SPEAKER_35]: And I'll leave it at that.

2829
04:03:52,319 --> 04:03:54,239
[SPEAKER_35]: And I do want to thank Vice President Collins.

2830
04:03:54,339 --> 04:04:00,801
[SPEAKER_35]: I want to thank Planning Development Sustainability staff and to NS Associates for working so hard on this.

2831
04:04:00,881 --> 04:04:11,443
[SPEAKER_35]: I want to thank the members of the public on both sides of this issue for commenting, because it does, you know, even the criticism helps us identify things for the city to be working on in the future.

2832
04:04:13,265 --> 04:04:15,046
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you, Councilor Lazzaro.

2833
04:04:16,388 --> 04:04:16,748
[SPEAKER_51]: Thank you.

2834
04:04:17,109 --> 04:04:20,372
[SPEAKER_51]: I wanted to address a couple of things that I heard tonight.

2835
04:04:20,632 --> 04:04:27,739
[SPEAKER_51]: The first was a resident who spoke about not being able to walk places.

2836
04:04:28,600 --> 04:04:31,783
[SPEAKER_51]: And when we talk about wanting to increase walkability,

2837
04:04:32,468 --> 04:04:38,790
[SPEAKER_51]: in a certain neighborhood that that leaves out a subset of our residents.

2838
04:04:38,930 --> 04:04:46,153
[SPEAKER_51]: And I think that's a really valuable and important thing to keep in mind when we have these conversations that many of our residents have disabilities.

2839
04:04:46,213 --> 04:04:52,695
[SPEAKER_51]: Many of our residents are older, can't or even may choose not to walk somewhere.

2840
04:04:52,815 --> 04:04:59,398
[SPEAKER_51]: And those are those residents preferences and abilities are just as valid.

2841
04:05:01,015 --> 04:05:05,236
[SPEAKER_51]: and that is part of the fabric of our neighborhoods and our city.

2842
04:05:05,876 --> 04:05:14,358
[SPEAKER_51]: And I think it's really important to weigh those concerns with everything that we're talking about all the time.

2843
04:05:14,998 --> 04:05:21,340
[SPEAKER_51]: And I think that goes hand in hand with something that I find really concerning about some of the edits that were made when

2844
04:05:25,073 --> 04:05:39,802
[SPEAKER_51]: the medical offices were changed and it was moved from something being a standard medical office to a neighborhood medical office with only five employees and it has to be very small and it's only able to open with

2845
04:05:40,622 --> 04:05:47,428
[SPEAKER_51]: CDB approval in mixed-use 2 and the commercial region of this corridor.

2846
04:05:48,509 --> 04:06:04,664
[SPEAKER_51]: I think that was a direct response to the proposed medication-assisted treatment site that ended up pulling its application due to community resistance and bad PR, and they didn't

2847
04:06:06,686 --> 04:06:13,649
[SPEAKER_51]: introduce themselves appropriately and the stigma against people with substance use disorder took over that conversation.

2848
04:06:13,669 --> 04:06:20,653
[SPEAKER_51]: I find that really frustrating because I think that it is discriminatory.

2849
04:06:20,673 --> 04:06:24,635
[SPEAKER_51]: I think that the conversation got really deeply off track.

2850
04:06:26,035 --> 04:06:28,337
[SPEAKER_51]: And what came out of that is

2851
04:06:30,087 --> 04:06:35,668
[SPEAKER_51]: a whole street now with almost no opportunity for doctor's offices.

2852
04:06:36,968 --> 04:06:49,071
[SPEAKER_51]: And I think that's kind of crazy, including a clinic where people can go get treatment for substance use disorder, which is a disease that you cannot discriminate against.

2853
04:06:49,691 --> 04:06:56,272
[SPEAKER_51]: And now we are not allowing, we're not allowing anybody to get that treatment on Salem Street.

2854
04:06:57,258 --> 04:07:01,281
[SPEAKER_51]: So I can't really do anything about that tonight.

2855
04:07:01,742 --> 04:07:03,003
[SPEAKER_51]: I'm not going to propose an amendment.

2856
04:07:03,643 --> 04:07:08,587
[SPEAKER_51]: I'm just really disappointed because I know a lot of people who deal with that.

2857
04:07:08,627 --> 04:07:13,651
[SPEAKER_51]: I think a lot of us know a lot of people that deal with that, and I think we've allowed

2858
04:07:15,002 --> 04:07:21,927
[SPEAKER_51]: that stigma to become something that has entered into our conversation about zoning.

2859
04:07:23,268 --> 04:07:25,030
[SPEAKER_51]: And I don't think it's appropriate.

2860
04:07:26,050 --> 04:07:41,362
[SPEAKER_51]: So that being said, I'm happy to support Councilor Leming's amendment to move back to mixed use two in the intersection in the center.

2861
04:07:42,011 --> 04:07:47,143
[SPEAKER_51]: of the corridor and at least then there would be the opportunity for there to be

2862
04:07:47,998 --> 04:07:51,081
[SPEAKER_51]: a CDB approved neighborhood medical office.

2863
04:07:51,841 --> 04:07:58,947
[SPEAKER_51]: Um, because as the resident who, okay, I think a couple of residents mentioned that they do need access to medical offices.

2864
04:07:59,247 --> 04:08:01,009
[SPEAKER_51]: So I think that's important.

2865
04:08:01,449 --> 04:08:07,594
[SPEAKER_51]: Um, I think it's a community good, and I think it would be a good thing to have at least available for somebody.

2866
04:08:08,255 --> 04:08:13,179
[SPEAKER_51]: Um, I, I do also just want to say thank you again to everybody for all of the hard work.

2867
04:08:13,219 --> 04:08:14,540
[SPEAKER_51]: It took a lot of time and energy.

2868
04:08:15,350 --> 04:08:18,611
[SPEAKER_51]: to put all of this together, and a lot of careful thought went into it.

2869
04:08:21,132 --> 04:08:23,292
[SPEAKER_51]: And I'm proud of all of the work that everybody's done.

2870
04:08:25,053 --> 04:08:26,433
[SPEAKER_51]: And I'm proud of everybody who spoke tonight.

2871
04:08:26,634 --> 04:08:32,295
[SPEAKER_51]: I think everybody was thoughtful and careful in their comments, and I appreciate it.

2872
04:08:32,875 --> 04:08:33,176
[SPEAKER_51]: Thank you.

2873
04:08:35,956 --> 04:08:38,317
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you, Councilor Lazzaro.

2874
04:08:39,257 --> 04:08:40,818
[SPEAKER_47]: Any further discussion by members of the Council?

2875
04:08:42,745 --> 04:08:43,646
[SPEAKER_47]: PB, Harmon Zuckerman, he or her.

2876
04:08:59,107 --> 04:09:03,451
[SPEAKER_47]: into the comprehensive plan and these iterations of our zoning recodification.

2877
04:09:03,471 --> 04:09:05,713
[SPEAKER_47]: This is the process.

2878
04:09:05,753 --> 04:09:07,035
[SPEAKER_47]: This is the public process.

2879
04:09:07,075 --> 04:09:10,738
[SPEAKER_47]: This is what representative government looks like.

2880
04:09:13,000 --> 04:09:17,985
[SPEAKER_47]: And we have a product before us that is the culmination of that process.

2881
04:09:18,125 --> 04:09:20,748
[SPEAKER_47]: So I just want to thank everybody again for their participation.

2882
04:09:22,324 --> 04:09:24,685
[SPEAKER_47]: We had over 70 people speak tonight.

2883
04:09:26,766 --> 04:09:37,951
[SPEAKER_47]: And that's in addition to dozens of public comments by email and all of the previous comments at Community Development Board hearings, City Council meetings, City Council Committee meetings.

2884
04:09:38,952 --> 04:09:50,277
[SPEAKER_47]: And that's just the part of this process we've just been doing for the past 13 months, never mind the two years of the comprehensive plan and the two years of zoning recodification we did before that.

2885
04:09:51,224 --> 04:09:53,225
[SPEAKER_47]: When we talk about how long have we been talking about this?

2886
04:09:53,265 --> 04:09:53,845
[SPEAKER_47]: A long time.

2887
04:09:55,346 --> 04:09:57,206
[SPEAKER_47]: We talked about how extensive the process was.

2888
04:09:57,466 --> 04:10:02,128
[SPEAKER_47]: The answer is unequivocally extensive, and that's how we got to where we are.

2889
04:10:03,409 --> 04:10:08,951
[SPEAKER_47]: There's a motion on the floor from Councilor Leming to amend.

2890
04:10:09,231 --> 04:10:18,634
[SPEAKER_47]: Essentially, I believe there's a motion to adopt the recommendations of the Community Development Board

2891
04:10:21,310 --> 04:10:28,152
[SPEAKER_47]: and approve the zoning ordinance except for the recommendation to shift from MX2 to MX1.

2892
04:10:28,713 --> 04:10:32,834
[SPEAKER_47]: So I think it's important to note the current proposal is still MX2.

2893
04:10:33,934 --> 04:10:38,156
[SPEAKER_47]: If we accepted the recommendations of the Community Development Board, it would go to MX1.

2894
04:10:38,216 --> 04:10:46,599
[SPEAKER_47]: So technically how we need to word this is that we're accepting all of the recommendations except for the recommendation to go to MX1 at Park Street and Salem Street.

2895
04:10:48,519 --> 04:10:50,820
[SPEAKER_47]: Now we could vote on the amendment.

2896
04:10:53,028 --> 04:10:54,789
[SPEAKER_47]: and then vote on the final motion.

2897
04:10:54,809 --> 04:10:58,612
[SPEAKER_47]: It looks like Council Member has a question.

2898
04:11:00,454 --> 04:11:07,479
[SPEAKER_41]: Sorry, just to clarify, would voting yes would be voting yes for the Community Development Board's amendment?

2899
04:11:08,260 --> 04:11:09,000
[SPEAKER_41]: No.

2900
04:11:09,120 --> 04:11:14,405
[SPEAKER_41]: Or would voting yes be supporting moving Park Street and Salem back from MX 1 to 2?

2901
04:11:15,612 --> 04:11:19,154
[SPEAKER_47]: So it's not back and that's the important thing to recognize here.

2902
04:11:19,835 --> 04:11:23,417
[SPEAKER_47]: We would be essentially you're saying, we'll do it this way.

2903
04:11:24,458 --> 04:11:30,762
[SPEAKER_47]: You're voting we're voting not to adopt the recommendation to move from MX two to MX one at Park Street and Salem Street.

2904
04:11:31,505 --> 04:11:37,707
[SPEAKER_47]: And then we will vote yes to approve the zoning ordinance with all of the other recommendations from the Community Development Board.

2905
04:11:37,747 --> 04:11:38,667
[SPEAKER_47]: So we'll take two votes.

2906
04:11:39,627 --> 04:11:45,348
[SPEAKER_47]: A yes vote on the first will be to keep MX2 at Parkin Salem.

2907
04:11:45,688 --> 04:11:55,691
[SPEAKER_47]: And then a yes vote on the second vote will be to adopt all of the other recommendations except for the shift from MX2 to MX1 and to approve the zoning ordinance.

2908
04:11:56,071 --> 04:11:58,392
[SPEAKER_47]: Does that make sense to everybody?

2909
04:11:58,412 --> 04:11:59,932
[SPEAKER_47]: All right.

2910
04:12:01,083 --> 04:12:13,351
[SPEAKER_47]: So the first vote is to not adopt the recommendation of the Community Development Board to go from MX2 zoning to MX1 zoning at Salem Street and Park Street.

2911
04:12:14,872 --> 04:12:17,614
[SPEAKER_47]: So that's a yes vote, keeps MX2.

2912
04:12:20,996 --> 04:12:22,977
[SPEAKER_47]: I see Vice President Collins.

2913
04:12:27,020 --> 04:12:30,542
[SPEAKER_47]: On that motion, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2914
04:12:33,025 --> 04:12:33,645
[SPEAKER_46]: Councilor Kelly.

2915
04:12:35,726 --> 04:12:36,486
[SPEAKER_46]: Vice President Collins.

2916
04:12:36,506 --> 04:12:40,367
[SPEAKER_46]: That's a little czar.

2917
04:12:41,608 --> 04:12:44,308
[SPEAKER_46]: Councilor Leming, yes, Councilor Scarpelli is absent.

2918
04:12:44,928 --> 04:12:46,969
[SPEAKER_46]: Councilor Tseng, President Bears.

2919
04:12:47,289 --> 04:12:49,610
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes, 60 affirmative no negative the motion passes.

2920
04:12:52,717 --> 04:13:03,382
[SPEAKER_47]: On the motion by Councilor Leming to adopt the remainder of the Community Development Board's recommendations and approve the Zoning Ordinance Amendment, seconded by.

2921
04:13:05,002 --> 04:13:07,063
[SPEAKER_47]: Seconded by Councilor Callahan.

2922
04:13:09,344 --> 04:13:12,806
[SPEAKER_47]: This is to adopt all of the other recommendations and approve.

2923
04:13:27,078 --> 04:13:28,479
[SPEAKER_47]: The second is Councilor Callahan.

2924
04:13:31,841 --> 04:13:32,822
[SPEAKER_47]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2925
04:13:33,222 --> 04:13:33,903
[SPEAKER_46]: Councilor Callahan.

2926
04:13:36,424 --> 04:13:37,245
[SPEAKER_46]: Vice President Collins.

2927
04:13:37,485 --> 04:13:37,585
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes.

2928
04:13:38,106 --> 04:13:38,806
[SPEAKER_46]: Councilor Lazzaro.

2929
04:13:38,846 --> 04:13:38,966
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes.

2930
04:13:39,607 --> 04:13:40,147
[SPEAKER_46]: Councilor Leming.

2931
04:13:40,247 --> 04:13:40,487
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes.

2932
04:13:40,848 --> 04:13:41,988
[SPEAKER_46]: Councilor Scarpelli is absent.

2933
04:13:42,549 --> 04:13:43,129
[SPEAKER_46]: Councilor Tseng.

2934
04:13:43,289 --> 04:13:43,429
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes.

2935
04:13:44,170 --> 04:13:44,770
[SPEAKER_46]: President Bears.

2936
04:13:44,990 --> 04:13:45,211
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes.

2937
04:13:45,371 --> 04:13:47,252
[SPEAKER_47]: Six in the affirmative, none in the negative, one absent.

2938
04:13:47,732 --> 04:13:48,533
[SPEAKER_47]: The motion passes.

2939
04:13:50,895 --> 04:13:52,316
[SPEAKER_47]: Nope, we're not done.

2940
04:13:53,576 --> 04:13:54,057
[SPEAKER_47]: Green score.

2941
04:13:55,782 --> 04:14:00,186
[SPEAKER_47]: So we still have to consider green score as part of this public hearing.

2942
04:14:00,226 --> 04:14:09,474
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm going to go to Council Vice President Collins to present on the green score element, and then I will reopen the public hearing on the green score.

2943
04:14:09,754 --> 04:14:10,595
[SPEAKER_47]: Councilor Collins.

2944
04:14:11,774 --> 04:14:12,834
[SPEAKER_52]: Thank you, President Bears.

2945
04:14:13,575 --> 04:14:20,797
[SPEAKER_52]: Now for a zoning proposal that will undoubtedly garner the same level of excitement as the prior.

2946
04:14:22,057 --> 04:14:34,722
[SPEAKER_52]: The green score proposal is a rubric for grading and essentially rewarding developers based on various requirements incentives that they meet for meeting environmental standards in their building projects.

2947
04:14:36,262 --> 04:14:38,383
[SPEAKER_52]: It does this by incorporating the new green score rubric

2948
04:14:38,903 --> 04:14:43,588
[SPEAKER_52]: into our site plan review process, and it defines new development waivers.

2949
04:14:44,489 --> 04:14:47,732
[SPEAKER_52]: Green Score is not a grading rubric that applies to every development.

2950
04:14:48,413 --> 04:14:55,961
[SPEAKER_52]: It applies only to projects that are located in certain zones within the FEMA National Flood Hazard Layer and projects that are subject to site plan review.

2951
04:14:57,342 --> 04:15:03,785
[SPEAKER_52]: The green score zoning proposal includes and then builds upon Medford's existing environmental standards for developers.

2952
04:15:04,706 --> 04:15:21,314
[SPEAKER_52]: It goes upon these existing standards such as stormwater management and permeable surfaces or open space and permeable surfaces to include additional flexible new ways for developers to meet environmental standards that we already know we want developers to be meeting in Medford.

2953
04:15:22,585 --> 04:15:26,966
[SPEAKER_52]: from meeting these specific and defined environmental and climate resiliency criteria.

2954
04:15:27,647 --> 04:15:33,688
[SPEAKER_52]: Developers may receive, I'm going to say quote unquote rewards, such as development waivers or bonuses.

2955
04:15:34,208 --> 04:15:36,529
[SPEAKER_52]: These waivers or bonuses are very clearly defined.

2956
04:15:36,569 --> 04:15:42,291
[SPEAKER_52]: It's not just anything, it's things that we have decided are worth trading for these specific environmental

2957
04:15:45,375 --> 04:15:51,943
[SPEAKER_52]: achievements that developers would probably not find it economically feasible or enticing to do otherwise.

2958
04:15:52,504 --> 04:16:04,379
[SPEAKER_52]: This is our way of encouraging developers to be more climate friendly than they would be otherwise, within this defined structure of waivers and rewards that still fit our vision, vision, sorry, long night, for our community.

2959
04:16:05,599 --> 04:16:13,128
[SPEAKER_52]: The incentive structure is a menu of different landscape and infrastructural elements that provide options that can be tailored to different building and site conditions.

2960
04:16:13,969 --> 04:16:22,078
[SPEAKER_52]: So it's designed to be flexible to different developers' needs and what conditions are on different lots, so that there's something that every developer can take us up on.

2961
04:16:22,618 --> 04:16:26,343
[SPEAKER_52]: They might include, just for example, planted areas, different types of plantings.

2962
04:16:27,403 --> 04:16:31,565
[SPEAKER_52]: green or blue roofs, vegetated walls, permeable paving.

2963
04:16:31,605 --> 04:16:33,746
[SPEAKER_52]: And there's quite a long list if folks are interested.

2964
04:16:33,766 --> 04:16:38,108
[SPEAKER_52]: This is laid out in the meeting materials that are linked on our public portal.

2965
04:16:38,768 --> 04:16:41,429
[SPEAKER_52]: And for the environmental set, you'll probably find it quite interesting.

2966
04:16:42,049 --> 04:16:51,153
[SPEAKER_52]: Lastly, I just want to clarify, green score does not allow developers to exceed our existing height or story maximums.

2967
04:16:52,073 --> 04:16:59,315
[SPEAKER_52]: Um, any incentives or waivers earned through green score or incentive zoning are still constrained by our total height maximums.

2968
04:17:00,355 --> 04:17:07,817
[SPEAKER_52]: Um, and I also want to clarify because we get this question a lot that green score is a separate process from building energy efficiency standards.

2969
04:17:08,217 --> 04:17:12,558
[SPEAKER_52]: We have already adopted the state specialized energy code, and this is different from that.

2970
04:17:13,899 --> 04:17:14,159
[SPEAKER_52]: Thank you.

2971
04:17:16,139 --> 04:17:17,740
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you, Vice President Collins.

2972
04:17:17,800 --> 04:17:18,480
[SPEAKER_47]: Councilor Callahan.

2973
04:17:20,183 --> 04:17:20,423
[SPEAKER_53]: Thank you.

2974
04:17:20,483 --> 04:17:24,528
[SPEAKER_53]: I just want to express how excited I am that we are including green score in our zoning.

2975
04:17:25,529 --> 04:17:27,411
[SPEAKER_53]: I think it's going to help us meet our climate goals.

2976
04:17:28,393 --> 04:17:34,199
[SPEAKER_53]: I live relatively close to Vistacab and it is an absolute tree and greenness desert.

2977
04:17:35,300 --> 04:17:36,141
[SPEAKER_53]: It is an incredibly

2978
04:17:37,703 --> 04:17:42,708
[SPEAKER_53]: this incredible heat island and deeply unpleasant to walk by.

2979
04:17:42,728 --> 04:17:54,901
[SPEAKER_53]: And I think that having this and especially the way that we have incorporated into Mystic Avenue and the way that we will be able to incorporate it into all of our zoning is just incredibly important.

2980
04:17:55,061 --> 04:17:55,902
[SPEAKER_53]: And I'm very excited about it.

2981
04:17:56,142 --> 04:17:56,583
[SPEAKER_53]: Thank you so much.

2982
04:17:56,603 --> 04:17:57,864
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

2983
04:17:57,924 --> 04:17:58,685
[SPEAKER_35]: Councilor Tseng.

2984
04:18:00,325 --> 04:18:02,906
[SPEAKER_35]: I have very similar sentiments to Councilor Callahan.

2985
04:18:03,606 --> 04:18:08,689
[SPEAKER_35]: This was one of the core planks of my environmental platform running for this term.

2986
04:18:09,369 --> 04:18:14,211
[SPEAKER_35]: And I think Vice President Collins did a superb job explaining it.

2987
04:18:15,391 --> 04:18:28,157
[SPEAKER_35]: This is really meant to get us and get developers in Medford to be much more accountable and much more incentivized to be innovative in how they address environmental issues and in making our city more livable.

2988
04:18:29,738 --> 04:18:38,764
[SPEAKER_35]: the numerous aspects of the green score with regards to vegetation, with regards to blue roofs and green walls, et cetera.

2989
04:18:39,584 --> 04:18:49,050
[SPEAKER_35]: All of those things are things that 21st century cities should be doing, that Medford can be doing, that we can do by passing this.

2990
04:18:50,892 --> 04:18:53,553
[SPEAKER_35]: I'll just end really quickly with a quick anecdote.

2991
04:18:55,300 --> 04:19:10,066
[SPEAKER_35]: This kind of stuff, the stormwater, the vegetarian mutation, all of this is so important because many of us live in neighborhoods or have lived in neighborhoods where the flooding gets really crazy when there's a heavy rain, where heat islands are a particular problem.

2992
04:19:10,546 --> 04:19:14,167
[SPEAKER_35]: These are all effects of climate change that we're seeing and facing now and today.

2993
04:19:14,667 --> 04:19:16,948
[SPEAKER_35]: This global issue really does affect us locally.

2994
04:19:17,188 --> 04:19:23,791
[SPEAKER_35]: And this is a core way for us to address this taken from our climate action adaptation plan.

2995
04:19:27,525 --> 04:19:28,466
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

2996
04:19:29,507 --> 04:19:32,569
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm going to, the public hearing remains open.

2997
04:19:32,589 --> 04:19:35,271
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm opening it back up on the green score question.

2998
04:19:36,812 --> 04:19:43,877
[SPEAKER_47]: If you'd like to speak in favor or in opposition or in any other way about the green score proposal, you can come to the podium or raise your hand on Zoom.

2999
04:19:44,978 --> 04:19:46,379
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record, you have three minutes.

3000
04:19:46,499 --> 04:19:50,022
[SPEAKER_48]: Castagnetti, Andrew, Cushion Street, Medford, Mass.

3001
04:19:50,803 --> 04:19:56,727
[SPEAKER_48]: I just wanted to, I'm saddened by something that's been happening for the last half a century.

3002
04:19:58,126 --> 04:20:02,248
[SPEAKER_48]: I don't know how the hell we ended up in this situation, supply and demand.

3003
04:20:02,288 --> 04:20:15,933
[SPEAKER_48]: When I went to elementary school, I recollect the teacher saying this economic system, capitalism, I guess, is basically built on supply and demand and that will dictate the price.

3004
04:20:15,953 --> 04:20:17,674
[SPEAKER_48]: That make sense?

3005
04:20:18,714 --> 04:20:24,016
[SPEAKER_48]: Maybe, mostly, but anyways, I kind of understand how,

3006
04:20:26,111 --> 04:20:41,134
[SPEAKER_48]: the prices became a million dollars and the developers, they didn't develop it back when they were in the mid price range or was it the government was the problem or a combination of both.

3007
04:20:41,714 --> 04:20:46,195
[SPEAKER_48]: And now with the Canadian plywood going through the roof, we'll never get out of this jam.

3008
04:20:48,796 --> 04:20:49,456
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

3009
04:20:50,476 --> 04:20:51,376
[SPEAKER_47]: Go to the podium.

3010
04:20:51,396 --> 04:20:52,296
[SPEAKER_47]: There's no hands on zoom.

3011
04:20:52,376 --> 04:20:53,156
[SPEAKER_47]: So we'll stay at the podium.

3012
04:20:53,196 --> 04:20:54,697
[SPEAKER_47]: Maybe the rest of the record, please.

3013
04:20:54,757 --> 04:20:55,377
[SPEAKER_47]: You have three minutes.

3014
04:20:56,581 --> 04:20:58,585
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you Mr. President.

3015
04:20:59,407 --> 04:21:04,338
[SPEAKER_38]: So, in theory, I definitely support the green score requirements.

3016
04:21:06,968 --> 04:21:10,809
[SPEAKER_38]: I was looking for, you know, in life there's no solutions, there are only trade-offs.

3017
04:21:11,549 --> 04:21:22,971
[SPEAKER_38]: And I was looking for a study showing how imposing the green score requirement will affect both the upfront and maintenance cost of housing.

3018
04:21:24,592 --> 04:21:28,452
[SPEAKER_38]: In other words, how does imposing a green score requirement affect housing affordability?

3019
04:21:28,812 --> 04:21:31,393
[SPEAKER_38]: Because there are things like, for example, a blue roof

3020
04:21:32,268 --> 04:21:40,206
[SPEAKER_38]: which collects water and it says that, for example, it needs to get inspected every time that there's a range of over an inch, which means pretty much in the summer, every rain.

3021
04:21:41,168 --> 04:21:46,152
[SPEAKER_38]: So, and other aspects of this will have an impact on construction costs.

3022
04:21:46,732 --> 04:22:07,568
[SPEAKER_38]: So I would like to know where the study that got conducted to determine how this will affect construction costs that then will get passed into upfront costs for buyers or renters, and also will affect HOAs and maintenance costs for residents, where is the study?

3023
04:22:09,711 --> 04:22:10,151
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

3024
04:22:10,171 --> 04:22:12,472
[SPEAKER_47]: I don't know, Vice President Collins, if you have anything on that.

3025
04:22:13,112 --> 04:22:21,895
[SPEAKER_47]: I know that this was based on the similar green score systems in Somerville and Cambridge, but I don't know if you have more.

3026
04:22:21,915 --> 04:22:27,236
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, so Somerville and Cambridge have houses that are, we consider the ones in Medford unaffordable.

3027
04:22:27,596 --> 04:22:31,057
[SPEAKER_38]: The ones in Somerville and Cambridge are stratospherically not affordable.

3028
04:22:31,398 --> 04:22:35,219
[SPEAKER_38]: So that's why I think a study that examines the impact

3029
04:22:36,157 --> 04:22:43,280
[SPEAKER_38]: practically of green score requirements on construction costs that again, then get passed on to residents will be helpful.

3030
04:22:43,540 --> 04:22:51,024
[SPEAKER_38]: And it's part of the trade off again, in theory, I support this, of course, but I think we need to study the holistic picture.

3031
04:22:52,064 --> 04:22:53,185
[SPEAKER_38]: Council Vice President Collins.

3032
04:22:54,095 --> 04:22:55,155
[SPEAKER_52]: Yeah, thank you for the question.

3033
04:22:55,175 --> 04:22:56,456
[SPEAKER_52]: I think that's a really thoughtful one.

3034
04:22:58,977 --> 04:23:05,780
[SPEAKER_52]: The planners may know they might have studies that accompanied their study of the municipalities where this has been rolled out before.

3035
04:23:05,800 --> 04:23:07,361
[SPEAKER_52]: I would have to follow up and ask them.

3036
04:23:07,381 --> 04:23:09,582
[SPEAKER_52]: I believe they dropped off the call a couple hours ago.

3037
04:23:10,102 --> 04:23:11,643
[SPEAKER_52]: We can try and get that information for you.

3038
04:23:12,043 --> 04:23:15,844
[SPEAKER_52]: What I will say is that, and again, I would want to fact check myself on this, I

3039
04:23:19,287 --> 04:23:43,683
[SPEAKER_52]: Green score is so multifactorial because essentially what it is, and I know you understand what it is we're saying, over here are a fairly long list of environmental or climate resiliency improvements that we would have developers do on a quite broad constraint, but still quite broad type of structures on a quite broad type of surfaces, not all commercial, not all residential.

3040
04:23:44,184 --> 04:23:45,925
[SPEAKER_52]: And over here, we have a series of

3041
04:23:47,104 --> 04:23:51,465
[SPEAKER_52]: you know, again, quote unquote, rewards or waivers or bonuses that they might get in return.

3042
04:23:51,605 --> 04:23:55,886
[SPEAKER_52]: Those are the reason that they're doing the increased environmental stuff over here.

3043
04:23:57,026 --> 04:24:07,369
[SPEAKER_52]: Because of the level of permutations just in that kind of framework alone, if there's a study on the economic impact overall, I'd be really curious to see it.

3044
04:24:07,409 --> 04:24:09,509
[SPEAKER_52]: I'm sure if there's one, our planners have consulted it.

3045
04:24:10,170 --> 04:24:15,771
[SPEAKER_52]: But I think this entire project for developers is an exercise in saying,

3046
04:24:17,171 --> 04:24:23,893
[SPEAKER_52]: What should we do over here that will make this a net positive for us economically over here because of what we will get in return?

3047
04:24:23,913 --> 04:24:30,275
[SPEAKER_52]: I feel like the example of this that we talk about most frequently is kind of pick any environmental criteria.

3048
04:24:30,675 --> 04:24:33,316
[SPEAKER_52]: Okay, we'll do a green roof.

3049
04:24:34,057 --> 04:24:37,378
[SPEAKER_52]: And in addition, you get to build one more story than you would otherwise.

3050
04:24:37,398 --> 04:24:38,658
[SPEAKER_52]: I'm not pulling that from the proposal.

3051
04:24:38,678 --> 04:24:41,159
[SPEAKER_52]: I'm just using kind of like round numbers such as it were.

3052
04:24:41,179 --> 04:24:44,280
[SPEAKER_52]: The developer in choosing

3053
04:24:45,891 --> 04:25:04,105
[SPEAKER_52]: which kind of environmental add-ons can they feasibly do, do they think is worthwhile, they're doing that calculation to say what can I do to meet green score at the minimum or optimal level to meet the minimum waiver structure to try to level up for increased benefits.

3054
04:25:05,205 --> 04:25:06,566
[SPEAKER_52]: I feel pretty confident that

3055
04:25:10,985 --> 04:25:11,705
[SPEAKER_52]: put this another way.

3056
04:25:13,446 --> 04:25:22,008
[SPEAKER_52]: Developers are interacting with the system in a way to increase their net gain in a way that also increases our net gain in terms of climate resiliency benefits that we wouldn't see otherwise.

3057
04:25:22,969 --> 04:25:28,230
[SPEAKER_52]: We can look into if there's plans that augmented in associate's study of the topic.

3058
04:25:28,930 --> 04:25:35,232
[SPEAKER_52]: But I don't have a clear answer for you because this could go in so many permutations of ways when it's implemented.

3059
04:25:35,672 --> 04:25:36,793
[SPEAKER_52]: Sorry, I don't have a clear answer for you.

3060
04:25:38,253 --> 04:25:50,323
[SPEAKER_47]: I do think the short answer is try to raise funds to do the nexus study, which will be around linkage, fee changes, inclusionary housing, and would also include the impact of this.

3061
04:25:50,563 --> 04:25:53,005
[SPEAKER_47]: So we're establishing the program.

3062
04:25:53,025 --> 04:26:01,933
[SPEAKER_47]: I think this is a best initial draft, but the nexus study piece is what's going to be needed to update inclusionary and linkage.

3063
04:26:02,013 --> 04:26:06,276
[SPEAKER_47]: And I could see it being applicable to this topic as well in terms of fine tuning.

3064
04:26:07,282 --> 04:26:13,404
[SPEAKER_47]: all of those programs and systems based on what the study says the market can bear in terms of costs.

3065
04:26:14,064 --> 04:26:14,124
[SPEAKER_38]: OK.

3066
04:26:14,864 --> 04:26:16,465
[SPEAKER_38]: And then there's two typos.

3067
04:26:17,125 --> 04:26:18,325
[SPEAKER_38]: I know that they corrected some.

3068
04:26:18,405 --> 04:26:20,666
[SPEAKER_38]: I don't know whether you want to correct them or you're not interested.

3069
04:26:21,066 --> 04:26:22,926
[SPEAKER_38]: Oh, yeah, if you want to point to them.

3070
04:26:22,966 --> 04:26:28,108
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, so on page 30, section 5, calculation, bullet 5.

3071
04:26:30,488 --> 04:26:31,469
[SPEAKER_47]: Sorry, 30.

3072
04:26:31,869 --> 04:26:35,590
[SPEAKER_38]: Page 30, section 5, calculation, bullet number 5.

3073
04:26:36,598 --> 04:26:42,262
[SPEAKER_38]: Table 5.1, I believe, should be table 5.3, because it's a bonus scores.

3074
04:26:43,943 --> 04:26:48,726
[SPEAKER_47]: This is if the landscape elements in table, if following conditions presented in table 5.1, it should say 5.3.

3075
04:26:48,826 --> 04:26:51,308
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, because it's a bonus, they get added.

3076
04:26:52,168 --> 04:26:53,529
[SPEAKER_47]: As a bonus credit, got it.

3077
04:26:53,930 --> 04:26:58,613
[SPEAKER_38]: And then the second one is page 37 in blue roofs, under blue roofs.

3078
04:27:01,875 --> 04:27:02,055
[SPEAKER_38]: Yep.

3079
04:27:02,415 --> 04:27:04,797
[SPEAKER_38]: Line 2, HEP should be HULP.

3080
04:27:09,867 --> 04:27:11,528
[SPEAKER_38]: Page 37, line two.

3081
04:27:13,729 --> 04:27:16,391
[SPEAKER_47]: Line two, flooding to surrounding area and help.

3082
04:27:16,671 --> 04:27:17,231
[SPEAKER_47]: It says help.

3083
04:27:17,571 --> 04:27:17,872
[SPEAKER_47]: Got it.

3084
04:27:18,092 --> 04:27:18,432
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

3085
04:27:18,512 --> 04:27:18,792
[SPEAKER_47]: That's it.

3086
04:27:18,812 --> 04:27:19,172
[SPEAKER_47]: No problem.

3087
04:27:19,192 --> 04:27:19,613
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

3088
04:27:19,633 --> 04:27:20,433
[SPEAKER_47]: You definitely read it.

3089
04:27:24,475 --> 04:27:25,036
[SPEAKER_47]: Fantastic.

3090
04:27:25,116 --> 04:27:28,378
[SPEAKER_47]: Is there any other comment on this item as part of the public hearing?

3091
04:27:28,778 --> 04:27:32,040
[SPEAKER_48]: Someone called me and said that this was not transmitted.

3092
04:27:32,220 --> 04:27:34,081
[SPEAKER_48]: This meeting was black followed.

3093
04:27:34,181 --> 04:27:35,522
[SPEAKER_48]: It didn't go over the airways.

3094
04:27:37,643 --> 04:27:39,124
[SPEAKER_47]: Kevin, are we transmitting?

3095
04:27:42,394 --> 04:27:42,694
[SPEAKER_47]: All right.

3096
04:27:45,017 --> 04:27:47,899
[SPEAKER_48]: And the Committee of the Whole did not go through at 6 p.m.

3097
04:27:48,100 --> 04:27:50,282
[SPEAKER_48]: That I can guarantee you.

3098
04:27:50,302 --> 04:27:51,503
[SPEAKER_47]: For TV?

3099
04:27:53,004 --> 04:27:54,406
[SPEAKER_47]: For Medford Community Media?

3100
04:27:54,426 --> 04:27:57,829
[SPEAKER_48]: It's on Channel 22.

3101
04:27:58,750 --> 04:28:02,294
[SPEAKER_47]: Kevin, Committee of the Whole on Channel 22?

3102
04:28:02,334 --> 04:28:02,434
[SPEAKER_47]: Okay.

3103
04:28:07,143 --> 04:28:09,064
[SPEAKER_47]: It did start late, started about 10 minutes late.

3104
04:28:09,084 --> 04:28:11,246
[SPEAKER_47]: This meeting also started about 10 minutes late.

3105
04:28:12,607 --> 04:28:16,950
[SPEAKER_47]: Can someone just go on YouTube and tell me if the file's there under the streaming?

3106
04:28:18,672 --> 04:28:19,332
[SPEAKER_47]: Councilor Tseng.

3107
04:28:21,093 --> 04:28:21,534
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

3108
04:28:22,114 --> 04:28:24,716
[SPEAKER_35]: This might help get at Mr. Fiori's questions.

3109
04:28:26,458 --> 04:28:29,541
[SPEAKER_35]: I think the simple answer is that it is very factor-based.

3110
04:28:29,681 --> 04:28:43,392
[SPEAKER_35]: So the green score, the way it works is that it adjusts flexibly for different beneficial landscapes that might come up, which means that there are different requirements as well.

3111
04:28:44,532 --> 04:28:51,238
[SPEAKER_35]: So that's something to factor into our thinking when we think about the economic concerns that were brought up.

3112
04:28:52,439 --> 04:29:03,111
[SPEAKER_35]: Part of the way of doing this is to also make it way clearer to developers how we approach our environmental standards.

3113
04:29:04,052 --> 04:29:08,617
[SPEAKER_35]: Instead of having to find all these things in different places, this makes it a really easy rubric and calculation.

3114
04:29:10,363 --> 04:29:20,457
[SPEAKER_35]: There, I think it also depends on the baseline you're comparing this to the baseline we have in Medford is really low so I think I'm still optimistic that it's going to create housing units.

3115
04:29:22,798 --> 04:29:26,562
[SPEAKER_35]: I think it's also worth saying that much of this is incentives.

3116
04:29:28,523 --> 04:29:41,295
[SPEAKER_35]: So there are a lot of things in here that developers aren't required to be building, but are ways for us to essentially give them the carrot and ask them to do the best for Redbird.

3117
04:29:43,247 --> 04:29:56,142
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you just we did check in on the stream stream has been up on YouTube for four and a half hours for this meeting, the committee, the whole is available if you go to city of Medford mass YouTube and you go to the live tab it's there.

3118
04:29:56,162 --> 04:30:03,031
[SPEAKER_47]: Our video tech and obviously if you're watching this you're you're experiencing this in real time.

3119
04:30:04,012 --> 04:30:13,925
[SPEAKER_47]: But our video tech, not just video tech, our MCM director, Kevin, says that it has been going out on the channels as well, and also a recording will be uploaded.

3120
04:30:14,418 --> 04:30:14,878
[SPEAKER_22]: That's correct.

3121
04:30:14,898 --> 04:30:17,241
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll be able to edit it and upload it tomorrow.

3122
04:30:17,421 --> 04:30:27,369
[SPEAKER_22]: And I we I can say with certainty that our current meeting is on I can see as I'm monitoring here that it's being broadcast to Comcast 22 and Verizon 43.

3123
04:30:28,010 --> 04:30:34,336
[SPEAKER_22]: And I believe the committee of the whole was also broadcast, but I don't have an easy way of verifying that.

3124
04:30:34,396 --> 04:30:37,819
[SPEAKER_22]: But both meetings will be made available to the public on medfordtv.org.

3125
04:30:38,822 --> 04:30:39,443
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you, Kevin.

3126
04:30:39,483 --> 04:30:44,106
[SPEAKER_47]: And if you're still with us, the daily numbers were three, six.

3127
04:30:48,529 --> 04:30:50,811
[SPEAKER_47]: All right, any further comment on the public hearing?

3128
04:30:53,753 --> 04:30:54,834
[SPEAKER_47]: Council Vice President Collins.

3129
04:30:56,075 --> 04:30:59,558
[SPEAKER_47]: All right, then I'm going to close the public hearing seeing no hands and no one at the podium.

3130
04:30:59,598 --> 04:31:02,340
[SPEAKER_47]: The public hearing on this portion is closed for the green score.

3131
04:31:03,921 --> 04:31:04,822
[SPEAKER_47]: Vice President Collins.

3132
04:31:07,300 --> 04:31:12,002
[SPEAKER_52]: I would motion to adopt the CDB's recommendations and approve the zoning ordinance amendment.

3133
04:31:13,142 --> 04:31:20,766
[SPEAKER_47]: On the motion to approve this zoning ordinance amendment with the recommendations of the Community Development Board by Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.

3134
04:31:23,887 --> 04:31:26,808
[SPEAKER_47]: When you're ready, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

3135
04:31:39,900 --> 04:31:40,500
[SPEAKER_46]: Councilor Callahan?

04:31:42,841 --> 04:31:42,901

04:31:43,702 --> 04:31:44,382
[SPEAKER_46]: Councilor Lazzaro?

3139
04:31:44,402 --> 04:31:44,502

04:31:45,182 --> 04:31:45,703
[SPEAKER_46]: Councilor Leming?

3141
04:31:45,723 --> 04:31:46,683
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes.

3142
04:31:46,703 --> 04:31:47,823
[SPEAKER_46]: Councilor Scarpelli is absent.

3143
04:31:48,504 --> 04:31:49,004
[SPEAKER_46]: Councilor Tseng?

3144
04:31:49,024 --> 04:31:49,084
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes.

3145
04:31:49,764 --> 04:31:50,425
[SPEAKER_47]: President Bears?

3146
04:31:50,525 --> 04:31:50,885
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes.

3147
04:31:50,925 --> 04:31:52,866
[SPEAKER_47]: Six in the affirmative, one absent.

3148
04:31:53,006 --> 04:31:53,986
[SPEAKER_47]: The motion passes.

3149
04:31:55,247 --> 04:31:56,447
[SPEAKER_47]: Vice President Collins?

3150
04:31:58,688 --> 04:31:59,509
[SPEAKER_52]: Thank you, President Bears.

3151
04:31:59,629 --> 04:32:04,050
[SPEAKER_52]: Motion to suspend the rules to take 25-042 out of order.

3152
04:32:04,471 --> 04:32:08,893
[SPEAKER_47]: On the motion to suspend the rules to paper 25042 out of order by Vice President Collins.

3153
04:32:08,913 --> 04:32:09,533
[SPEAKER_47]: Seconded by?

3154
04:32:11,010 --> 04:32:28,120
[SPEAKER_47]: seconded by councilor Leming all those in favor oppose motion passes 2, 5, 0, 4, 2, submitted by interim superintendent Suzanne Galusi, Metropolitan Public Schools, Massachusetts School Building Authority, accelerated repair statements of interest for roof and HVAC systems at the Roberts, Missittuck, and Brooks Elementary Schools.

3155
04:32:28,680 --> 04:32:37,165
[SPEAKER_47]: We have with us the assistant superintendent, Peter Cushing, who will still be ready for our school day tomorrow to present on this item.

3156
04:32:37,645 --> 04:32:40,127
[SPEAKER_47]: I also do have a memorandum, which I can

3157
04:32:41,007 --> 04:32:56,516
[SPEAKER_47]: attempt to read and summarize quickly, which is to say that the city of Medford and Medford Public Schools completed five school building projects between 2001 and 2003 phase one the Andrews and McGlynn complex phase two the Brooks, Mississippi and Roberts elementary schools.

3158
04:32:57,096 --> 04:32:59,117
[SPEAKER_47]: While these are the new schools they are 25 years old.

3159
04:33:01,218 --> 04:33:09,140
[SPEAKER_47]: We have moved forward on refurbishing the roof and HVAC systems at the phase one Andrews and McGlynn complex.

3160
04:33:11,040 --> 04:33:23,443
[SPEAKER_47]: And now the MSBA has opened a short window of the accelerated repair statement of interest period for our school districts to submit projects focused on things like deferred maintenance.

3161
04:33:24,863 --> 04:33:28,484
[SPEAKER_47]: And that is somewhere that we're looking at for the

3162
04:33:30,657 --> 04:33:43,040
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm going to turn it over to Assistant Superintendent Cushing at this time because he can speak to all of this better than I can and can probably summarize this memorandum better than I can.

3163
04:33:45,153 --> 04:33:47,475
[SPEAKER_27]: Good evening, Council President and members of the Council.

3164
04:33:47,575 --> 04:33:51,818
[SPEAKER_27]: Really appreciate you having me this evening and hopefully not this morning.

3165
04:33:53,179 --> 04:34:01,346
[SPEAKER_27]: I do want to say that the Metro Public Schools and the City Council has been very supportive of the projects of the Andrews and McGlynn.

3166
04:34:02,326 --> 04:34:08,231
[SPEAKER_27]: Those renovation projects are really about to hit the fast acceleration pace.

3167
04:34:08,950 --> 04:34:24,538
[SPEAKER_27]: What's really critical on these is for the Roberts, the Missituk, and the Brooks, these are three separate statements of interest that will address similar projects to what we're working on at the McGlynn and the Andrews.

3168
04:34:24,778 --> 04:34:35,004
[SPEAKER_27]: So looking at roof refurbishments or replacements and upgrading slash addressing HVAC concerns that are also at those schools.

3169
04:34:35,826 --> 04:34:41,110
[SPEAKER_27]: Um, and we anticipate will accelerate rapidly over the next five year period.

3170
04:34:41,931 --> 04:34:46,175
[SPEAKER_27]: Ah, a failure of us to submit a statement of interest once again, a statement of interest.

3171
04:34:46,335 --> 04:35:01,247
[SPEAKER_27]: There's no guarantee that we will be selected by MSBA, but it is really critical that we submit these in every attempt to make sure that we are, um, accessing whatever dollars we can to defer

3172
04:35:02,707 --> 04:35:07,112
[SPEAKER_27]: payments from, I'm sorry, to defray costs to the Medford taxpayers.

3173
04:35:08,213 --> 04:35:09,895
[SPEAKER_27]: So this evening I'm asking that...

3174
04:35:11,330 --> 04:35:14,132
[SPEAKER_27]: The MSBA is very specific in their request.

3175
04:35:15,173 --> 04:35:24,159
[SPEAKER_27]: The language that is submitted for the full text and description is specific and needs to be voted on for each of the three.

3176
04:35:24,239 --> 04:35:33,446
[SPEAKER_27]: The Medford School Committee last Wednesday voted on each of these three to be approved, and I'm requesting the same of this body tonight.

3177
04:35:33,546 --> 04:35:34,827
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm happy to answer any questions.

3178
04:35:35,327 --> 04:35:51,627
[SPEAKER_27]: But this basically authorizes the Metro Public Schools to submit statements of interest and hopefully receive an invitation to funding to really help defray the costs associated with these renovations.

3179
04:35:53,886 --> 04:35:54,686
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you, Superintendent.

3180
04:35:54,726 --> 04:35:56,768
[SPEAKER_47]: We do have questions from a few council members.

3181
04:35:56,808 --> 04:35:59,969
[SPEAKER_47]: I just wanted to ask you one myself.

3182
04:36:00,650 --> 04:36:13,877
[SPEAKER_47]: Essentially, this is a program where the MSBA will pay for some portion, if we are accepted on our statement of interest, and if we are approved, the MSBA will pay for a portion of the costs to replace the roof and the HVAC at the elementary schools.

3183
04:36:14,718 --> 04:36:31,478
[SPEAKER_47]: And we are already undergoing that process for the K through eight McGlynn and Andrews middle school and had no idea that this process was potentially going to reopen at the time that we were moving forward on that, and that the conditions are worse at those schools than the elementary schools.

3184
04:36:32,327 --> 04:36:37,849
[SPEAKER_27]: Correct, we really had no choice but to move forward with the Andrews and the McGlynn.

3185
04:36:38,569 --> 04:36:46,752
[SPEAKER_27]: And this is to really look at what we can do to make sure we're accessing whatever funding is available.

3186
04:36:48,092 --> 04:36:48,472
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

3187
04:36:48,572 --> 04:36:52,674
[SPEAKER_47]: I'll go to Councilor Callahan, Councilor Lazzaro, Councilor Collins, Councilor Callahan.

3188
04:36:53,404 --> 04:36:53,704
[SPEAKER_53]: Thank you.

3189
04:36:53,724 --> 04:36:56,606
[SPEAKER_53]: I have a very simple question, which is on this request.

3190
04:36:56,726 --> 04:37:05,250
[SPEAKER_53]: It does say that the facilities assessment is being conducted by Habib Associates, who is an approved on-call house doctor for the city.

3191
04:37:05,710 --> 04:37:08,992
[SPEAKER_53]: And I just, I will say, found that a little bit confusing.

3192
04:37:09,132 --> 04:37:10,573
[SPEAKER_53]: Do we have an on-call house doctor?

3193
04:37:11,593 --> 04:37:21,042
[SPEAKER_53]: which my understanding from the internet is an actual doctor, like who works for a hospital or an institution, which could be the city, and a doctor is conducting a facilities assessment.

3194
04:37:21,142 --> 04:37:27,588
[SPEAKER_53]: I just didn't seem to, I was wondering if there's a typo.

3195
04:37:28,409 --> 04:37:31,412
[SPEAKER_47]: I assume house doctor is a term of art, Superintendent Cushing.

3196
04:37:32,712 --> 04:37:38,376
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, so the city has numerous house doctors who are basically on call.

3197
04:37:38,396 --> 04:37:40,838
[SPEAKER_27]: They've gone through the procurement approval process.

3198
04:37:42,299 --> 04:37:51,825
[SPEAKER_27]: Our architect, Copley Wolfe for the McGlynn Playground, was one of three house doctors available to us to select.

3199
04:37:52,405 --> 04:37:55,828
[SPEAKER_27]: It's still a competitive process or, you know, the ability to

3200
04:37:57,048 --> 04:38:05,630
[SPEAKER_27]: reach out to one of the three and see where their pricing would be, but a lot of the procurement pieces have been pre-vetted.

3201
04:38:06,510 --> 04:38:09,731
[SPEAKER_47]: So these are people who are essentially on, potentially on retainer.

3202
04:38:10,151 --> 04:38:15,292
[SPEAKER_47]: There are three firms that do assessments of facility conditions and let us know their recommendation.

3203
04:38:15,832 --> 04:38:16,152
[SPEAKER_16]: Correct.

3204
04:38:17,072 --> 04:38:17,272
[SPEAKER_47]: Great.

3205
04:38:17,532 --> 04:38:17,692
Okay.

3206
04:38:18,032 --> 04:38:18,312
[SPEAKER_47]: All right.

3207
04:38:18,672 --> 04:38:18,893
[SPEAKER_47]: Great.

3208
04:38:20,813 --> 04:38:21,313
[SPEAKER_47]: Councilor Lazzaro.

3209
04:38:24,174 --> 04:38:30,477
[SPEAKER_51]: It is becoming clear to me that these things are going to start happening really quickly all at once now.

3210
04:38:30,857 --> 04:38:32,578
[SPEAKER_51]: Is that accurate, Superintendent?

3211
04:38:33,938 --> 04:38:39,240
[SPEAKER_27]: What I would say is that I think it's really great the way that Medford built its schools in 2001 and 2003.

3212
04:38:39,321 --> 04:38:40,061
[SPEAKER_27]: However, as building systems age,

3213
04:38:45,882 --> 04:39:06,314
[SPEAKER_27]: we are now entering that window of failure or aging where deferred maintenance, I would definitely say that the roofs have a lifespan as they do on our houses and HVAC systems have a lifespan and we are entering that end of life period.

3214
04:39:07,735 --> 04:39:09,676
[SPEAKER_51]: Understood, motion to approve.

3215
04:39:10,556 --> 04:39:12,717
[SPEAKER_47]: On the motion of, we're gonna have to take three votes.

3216
04:39:14,415 --> 04:39:15,698
[SPEAKER_47]: but I'll go to Vice President.

3217
04:39:15,718 --> 04:39:16,560
[SPEAKER_47]: There's a motion to approve.

3218
04:39:16,841 --> 04:39:23,135
[SPEAKER_47]: We'll take three votes separately, one on each school by Councilor Lazzaro, seconded by Councilor Tseng, Vice President Collins.

3219
04:39:26,224 --> 04:39:35,293
[SPEAKER_52]: Thank you, Councilor Lazzaro beat me to the motion but I just want to say thank you so much Superintendent Cushing especially for hanging with us to present this paper so late in the evening.

3220
04:39:35,313 --> 04:39:46,444
[SPEAKER_52]: And, you know, all of these projects happening at the same time and the prioritization efforts speaks to how diligent the school's administration is about making sure that

3221
04:39:47,204 --> 04:40:00,131
[SPEAKER_52]: what needs to happen on what timeline is being paid attention to so closely by the school's administration to make sure that students will enjoy the upgraded buildings that they need on the timeline, that they need to not be impacted by a building problem.

3222
04:40:00,151 --> 04:40:02,813
[SPEAKER_52]: So just thank you so much for your work and excited to get to vote on this.

3223
04:40:06,955 --> 04:40:10,177
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you, Vice President Collins.

3224
04:40:10,217 --> 04:40:11,077
[SPEAKER_47]: Any further discussion?

3225
04:40:11,097 --> 04:40:14,139
[SPEAKER_47]: Any discussion on this by members of the public?

3226
04:40:17,537 --> 04:40:19,918
[SPEAKER_47]: Seeing none, anything further you'd like to say, Superintendent Cushing?

3227
04:40:22,179 --> 04:40:26,220
[SPEAKER_27]: I really appreciate, actually, all of the discussion that happened tonight.

3228
04:40:26,920 --> 04:40:35,424
[SPEAKER_27]: And I think it really shows a robust environment that we're privileged to work in here for the students at Medford.

3229
04:40:35,484 --> 04:40:37,104
[SPEAKER_27]: So I do want to just say thank you.

3230
04:40:38,485 --> 04:40:47,148
[SPEAKER_27]: And I appreciate the hopeful, successful passage of this so that I can get to work authoring these statements of interest.

3231
04:40:48,321 --> 04:40:48,581
[SPEAKER_47]: Great.

3232
04:40:49,382 --> 04:40:49,723
[SPEAKER_47]: All right.

3233
04:40:50,624 --> 04:40:56,931

04:41:46,936 --> 04:41:48,397
[SPEAKER_47]: One absent, the motion passes.

3256
04:41:48,477 --> 04:41:51,099
[SPEAKER_47]: It's a motion to approve for Roberts Elementary School.

3257
04:41:51,119 --> 04:41:56,343
[SPEAKER_47]: A motion of Councilor Lazzaro, seconded by Councilor Callahan to approve for the Roberts School.

3258
04:41:57,664 --> 04:41:58,985
[SPEAKER_47]: Mr. Clerk, when you're ready, please call the roll.

3259
04:42:02,588 --> 04:42:09,854
[SPEAKER_46]: That's Kellyanne vice president Collins Council was our Councilor Leming concert Scarpelli is absent.

3260
04:42:10,134 --> 04:42:12,076
[SPEAKER_46]: Councilor Tseng President Bears.

3261
04:42:12,136 --> 04:42:16,679
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes, 60 affirmative one absent the motion passes is approved.

3262
04:42:16,759 --> 04:42:18,381
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you, Superintendent cushion.

3263
04:42:19,161 --> 04:42:19,702
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you very much.

3264
04:42:22,568 --> 04:42:24,669
[SPEAKER_47]: Motions, orders, and resolutions.

3265
04:42:24,909 --> 04:42:27,190
[SPEAKER_47]: 24468, offered by Councilor Tseng.

3266
04:42:27,210 --> 04:42:29,311
[SPEAKER_47]: Draft city charter is amended by the committee of the whole.

3267
04:42:29,531 --> 04:42:35,935
[SPEAKER_47]: The draft city charter proposal is amended by the city council and committee of the whole after the governance committees can review processes attached.

3268
04:42:36,455 --> 04:42:41,197
[SPEAKER_47]: If approved by the council, the draft will be submitted to the mayor for her consideration for submission to the legislature.

3269
04:42:41,677 --> 04:42:47,260
[SPEAKER_47]: If approved by the legislature, the voters of the city of Medford will approve or deny the draft charter on the November 4th, 2025 municipal election ballot.

3270
04:42:49,571 --> 04:42:56,635
[SPEAKER_47]: This is our final meeting, at least of the process so far on the draft city charter.

3271
04:42:57,636 --> 04:43:05,340
[SPEAKER_47]: We have held several meetings in the governance committee as well as a meeting committee of the whole to discuss amendments to the city charter.

3272
04:43:07,021 --> 04:43:09,222
[SPEAKER_47]: Essentially, the main principles of the charter are

3273
04:43:10,783 --> 04:43:19,911
[SPEAKER_47]: what they were coming in, which is maintaining a strong mayor-weak council form of government with a slight shift of some power from the mayor to the council.

3274
04:43:20,852 --> 04:43:31,541
[SPEAKER_47]: This creates a charter that is a special act charter, not an adoption of different sections of state law, so essentially a charter that is a coherent document that is easily accessible and readable by the voters.

3275
04:43:32,653 --> 04:43:40,602
[SPEAKER_47]: This shifts from an all at large council to a hybrid of at large seats and local district seats.

3276
04:43:42,104 --> 04:43:44,226
[SPEAKER_47]: And it shifts

3277
04:43:45,636 --> 04:43:51,398
[SPEAKER_47]: some that essentially reduces the mayor's role on the school committee by not requiring the mayor to be the chair.

3278
04:43:52,559 --> 04:43:57,101
[SPEAKER_47]: But in general, it does shift some power away from the mayor in regards to the school committee.

3279
04:43:57,641 --> 04:44:07,145
[SPEAKER_47]: And with that, I will turn it over to Councilor Tseng, who is the chair of the Governance Committee, who has shepherded this through the process so far and can provide additional summary.

3280
04:44:08,276 --> 04:44:08,636
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

3281
04:44:09,256 --> 04:44:12,917
[SPEAKER_35]: President Bears, I think you covered the substantive changes very well.

3282
04:44:14,437 --> 04:44:29,701
[SPEAKER_35]: Just to give a quick overview of the process, we as a governance committee received the recommendations from the mayor after her review from the Charter Study Commission who prepared a bunch of recommendations.

3283
04:44:31,082 --> 04:44:45,052
[SPEAKER_35]: During this whole process, we have been doing our best to make sure that the stakeholders who have been working on this so much have been included in our discussions, including inviting members of the Charter Study Committee to our meetings.

3284
04:44:45,693 --> 04:44:49,295
[SPEAKER_35]: The Collins Center was here at a number of governance committee meetings as well.

3285
04:44:49,816 --> 04:44:57,822
[SPEAKER_35]: And I've also been in contact with mayor's office throughout the process, even before we started in the governance committee.

3286
04:44:58,882 --> 04:45:20,091
[SPEAKER_35]: In the Governance Committee, as President Bayer has acknowledged or noted, we made several edits, all in the spirit of the Charter, but after very long discussions about what we thought aligned with the values of Charter review, notably promoting equity.

3287
04:45:21,672 --> 04:45:32,989
[SPEAKER_35]: In doing that, we made, in addition to the technical edits we made, we passed a new recommendation for what that more local representation would look like.

3288
04:45:33,638 --> 04:45:53,471
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm ending up with a four district five at large model, as you said, and by removing the mayor's the school committee chair, which is a change that most residents in our community have been telling the people on the on the charter study committee and in governments that they wanted to see.

3289
04:45:55,567 --> 04:46:02,690
[SPEAKER_35]: to quickly, there's been a lot of conversation and discourse over ward representation, what that looks like here.

3290
04:46:02,750 --> 04:46:14,334
[SPEAKER_35]: And I know there are even Councilors who, myself included, have noted that there are even better systems out there that we would like to see, like ranked choice voting, like multiple member districts.

3291
04:46:14,354 --> 04:46:14,514
[SPEAKER_35]: But

3292
04:46:17,455 --> 04:46:28,160
[SPEAKER_35]: The charter as it stands today, I think is a fair distillation of the conversations that we had on the governance committee and in the committee the whole meeting last week.

3293
04:46:29,440 --> 04:46:33,902
[SPEAKER_35]: And what is politically feasible for us to get something through the state house.

3294
04:46:37,140 --> 04:46:40,061
[SPEAKER_35]: I think a quick note on equity, we've talked a lot about it.

3295
04:46:40,121 --> 04:46:42,643
[SPEAKER_35]: I know there's been more conversations online about it.

3296
04:46:43,263 --> 04:47:01,492
[SPEAKER_35]: I spent time today talking to, there's one article in particular that's become a subject of conversation or article written by my professor, my advising professor who I talked to today, whose recommendation, whose interpretation of what she wrote.

3297
04:47:02,072 --> 04:47:08,297
[SPEAKER_35]: is the same as my interpretation of what was written, which is that we have to be careful not to take the easy way out.

3298
04:47:08,778 --> 04:47:24,431
[SPEAKER_35]: We have to be careful to make sure that we're not incentivizing politicians to isolate certain voting groups and constituencies in the city, that it makes sense for us to keep politicians accountable to more diverse constituency groups.

3299
04:47:26,596 --> 04:47:31,619
[SPEAKER_35]: There's a news article in God of Nomad for about the conversation that we had.

3300
04:47:31,639 --> 04:47:33,439
[SPEAKER_35]: I know Tufts Daily is working on something as well.

3301
04:47:33,900 --> 04:47:35,460
[SPEAKER_35]: So I'll leave that there.

3302
04:47:36,781 --> 04:47:48,907
[SPEAKER_35]: I did get feedback from the school committee counsel, Howard Greenspan, Attorney Greenspan, about the two sections that our governance committee noted to ask for his feedback.

3303
04:47:48,947 --> 04:47:50,228
[SPEAKER_35]: So I'll quickly

3304
04:47:51,477 --> 04:47:59,644
[SPEAKER_35]: tell you guys, I've also sent this to the clerk and President Bears, who the clerk heard of these has distributed this to everyone.

3305
04:48:01,565 --> 04:48:13,615
[SPEAKER_35]: So on the specific wording around appointment authority of positions under the superintendent in section 4-5, B1, we raised this for Attorney Greenspan to look at because

3306
04:48:17,338 --> 04:48:22,701
[SPEAKER_35]: The state charter, DSEE regulations, and mass general law all say slightly different things.

3307
04:48:23,302 --> 04:48:32,387
[SPEAKER_35]: His recommendation is that the specifics of the positions are removed from the charter, and the reference conferring all the authority of the MGL is sufficient.

3308
04:48:33,468 --> 04:48:37,371
[SPEAKER_35]: He recommended against duplication where there could end up being discrepancy.

3309
04:48:37,451 --> 04:48:49,703
[SPEAKER_35]: He further said that if that clause must remain, there are other additional positions that need to be included, which Vice Chair Graham included in her prior comments.

3310
04:48:50,550 --> 04:49:08,181
[SPEAKER_35]: With that being the advice from Attorney Greenspan, I would make a motion to approve this, but strike section 4-5B1, and to renumber the rest of the section accordingly.

3311
04:49:09,521 --> 04:49:10,822
[SPEAKER_35]: Yeah, yeah, the whole section.

3312
04:49:13,939 --> 04:49:18,861
[SPEAKER_35]: So that is the main edit that Attorney Greenspan has recommended to us.

3313
04:49:19,941 --> 04:49:33,327
[SPEAKER_35]: The other section that we had Attorney Greenspan look at was 8-43 about ineligible measures to be put on a referendum ballot.

3314
04:49:34,327 --> 04:49:48,653
[SPEAKER_35]: We amended that in our last Committee of the Whole meeting to read in addition to the city budget or the school committee budget as a whole, we added the words or any part thereof.

3315
04:49:49,193 --> 04:49:55,276
[SPEAKER_35]: And Attorney Greenspan said that the change that we made as the Committee of the Whole is sufficient.

3316
04:49:58,179 --> 04:50:17,473
[SPEAKER_47]: Great, so there's a motion on the floor to approve this draft as amended by Councilor Tseng to strike section 45B1 and renumber the following two sections as one and two.

3317
04:50:18,754 --> 04:50:20,795
[SPEAKER_47]: All right, on that motion seconded by.

3318
04:50:21,656 --> 04:50:24,097
[SPEAKER_47]: Seconded by Vice President Collins, Councilor Callahan.

3319
04:50:24,117 --> 04:50:27,880
[SPEAKER_53]: I'm not gonna speak on that motion, but I'll speak

3320
04:50:28,439 --> 04:50:32,982
[SPEAKER_53]: on the more general topic of the charter?

3321
04:50:33,283 --> 04:50:33,523
[SPEAKER_47]: Sure.

3322
04:50:33,543 --> 04:50:34,824
[SPEAKER_47]: The motion is the whole thing.

3323
04:50:35,504 --> 04:50:37,686
[SPEAKER_47]: So right now, the motion is to adopt everything.

3324
04:50:37,706 --> 04:50:38,186
[SPEAKER_47]: Beautiful.

3325
04:50:38,406 --> 04:50:38,626
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes.

3326
04:50:38,667 --> 04:50:39,067
[SPEAKER_47]: So you're good.

3327
04:50:39,087 --> 04:50:39,427
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

3328
04:50:40,268 --> 04:50:41,088
[SPEAKER_53]: It is late at night.

3329
04:50:41,709 --> 04:50:43,370
[SPEAKER_53]: I apologize to my fellow city councilors.

3330
04:50:43,410 --> 04:50:44,911
[SPEAKER_53]: I'm going to keep you up for another few minutes.

3331
04:50:45,171 --> 04:50:48,374
[SPEAKER_53]: I have been very interested in voting systems for decades.

3332
04:50:48,454 --> 04:50:52,357
[SPEAKER_53]: I studied the mathematics of voting systems while getting my undergraduate degree in math.

3333
04:50:53,357 --> 04:50:56,399
[SPEAKER_53]: And so I think I really want to take this opportunity since I haven't

3334
04:50:57,200 --> 04:51:08,350
[SPEAKER_53]: previously spoken very much about the charter to talk about why I am in favor of the four districts and five at large system for the city council.

3335
04:51:09,711 --> 04:51:13,875
[SPEAKER_53]: So if you look at both national and international organizations that study voting systems.

3336
04:51:15,176 --> 04:51:25,486
[SPEAKER_53]: It is well understood that multi seat systems are better than single seat systems and within single seat elections that first past the post is one of the worst possible electoral systems.

3337
04:51:25,947 --> 04:51:30,311
[SPEAKER_53]: I'm going to catch people up on what these terms mean single seat versus multi seat.

3338
04:51:31,545 --> 04:51:40,671
[SPEAKER_53]: So in a single-seat election, people in a localized geographic area, usually called a district or a ward, they only get to vote for one person, who usually is required to live in that ward.

3339
04:51:41,452 --> 04:51:43,233
[SPEAKER_53]: And only one person represents those people.

3340
04:51:43,453 --> 04:51:46,775
[SPEAKER_53]: So ward representation is single-seat representation.

3341
04:51:48,056 --> 04:51:55,921
[SPEAKER_53]: In a multi-seat election, people in a geographic area, like a city or a state, get to vote for multiple people, and multiple people represent them.

3342
04:51:56,261 --> 04:51:59,844
[SPEAKER_53]: So at-large representation is multi-seat representation.

3343
04:52:01,265 --> 04:52:06,970
[SPEAKER_53]: I want to talk about the terms proportional representation versus winner-take-all representation.

3344
04:52:08,491 --> 04:52:11,754
[SPEAKER_53]: So first, all single-seat elections are by definition winner-take-all elections.

3345
04:52:12,695 --> 04:52:16,838
[SPEAKER_53]: But multi-seat elections can be proportional, or they can be winner-take-all.

3346
04:52:17,519 --> 04:52:24,785
[SPEAKER_53]: So if you think about how the Democratic and Republican presidential primaries work, and you may not know how they work, but I'm going to tell you how they work.

3347
04:52:25,845 --> 04:52:33,467
[SPEAKER_53]: In the Democratic presidential primary, delegates in each state are allocated proportionally to the candidates based on the statewide vote.

3348
04:52:33,948 --> 04:52:40,069
[SPEAKER_53]: So if a candidate wins 40% of the vote, that candidate gets 40% of the delegates from that state.

3349
04:52:40,870 --> 04:52:41,490
[SPEAKER_53]: It's proportional.

3350
04:52:42,310 --> 04:52:52,293
[SPEAKER_53]: In most states in the Republican primary, all of a state's delegates are allocated to the candidate who receives the majority of votes in that state's primary election.

3351
04:52:53,213 --> 04:52:57,176
[SPEAKER_53]: Or I think it's actually the plurality of votes in that state's election.

3352
04:52:57,657 --> 04:53:04,202
[SPEAKER_53]: So if you were to get 52% of the vote in that state, you would get 100% of the delegates from that state.

3353
04:53:04,222 --> 04:53:05,923
[SPEAKER_53]: That's called winner-take-all.

3354
04:53:06,564 --> 04:53:14,289
[SPEAKER_53]: And the third set of terms I'm going to talk about are first-past-the-post, runoff elections, and rank-choice voting.

3355
04:53:14,530 --> 04:53:18,473
[SPEAKER_53]: There are lots of different ways to run a single-seat election.

3356
04:53:19,093 --> 04:53:21,795
[SPEAKER_53]: But these three are the only ones that really we do in America.

3357
04:53:21,815 --> 04:53:22,955
[SPEAKER_53]: So I'll talk about those.

3358
04:53:24,336 --> 04:53:28,598
[SPEAKER_53]: In single seat elections in America, you most often see what's called first past the post.

3359
04:53:29,399 --> 04:53:37,243
[SPEAKER_53]: So everybody votes for one, whoever gets the most votes wins, even if you have five candidates and the highest vote getter only gets 25% of the vote.

3360
04:53:38,424 --> 04:53:44,567
[SPEAKER_53]: That means the 75% of people who voted for those other four candidates don't get their preferred choice.

3361
04:53:45,808 --> 04:53:47,069
[SPEAKER_53]: Now, if you have a runoff election,

3362
04:53:47,767 --> 04:53:58,089
[SPEAKER_53]: then, and you have five candidates running and one of them, the top voter gets only 25%, then there's a runoff later with the top two vote getters.

3363
04:53:58,549 --> 04:54:02,190
[SPEAKER_53]: And during that runoff, since there's only two, somebody is gonna get over 50% of the vote.

3364
04:54:03,310 --> 04:54:09,831
[SPEAKER_53]: Ranked choice voting is also called instant runoff voting because voters rank the candidates in their order of preference.

3365
04:54:11,051 --> 04:54:14,052
[SPEAKER_53]: And essentially you're asking the voter to tell you their

3366
04:54:14,935 --> 04:54:18,357
[SPEAKER_53]: took their vote and their runoff vote on the same ballot.

3367
04:54:18,377 --> 04:54:20,399
[SPEAKER_53]: And that's why it's called instant runoff voting.

3368
04:54:22,040 --> 04:54:41,413
[SPEAKER_53]: And so what I'm going to talk about is how groups and researchers who study these different voting systems, what they see as outcomes for these different voting systems, or at least for the one considered to get the best representation and the one considered to get the worst representation.

3369
04:54:43,015 --> 04:54:51,701
[SPEAKER_53]: Multi-seat proportional representation is associated with a greater likelihood that each constituent has at least one elected official who agrees with them on policy.

3370
04:54:52,782 --> 04:54:56,685
[SPEAKER_53]: It is not possible to gerrymander in this system.

3371
04:54:57,466 --> 04:55:02,890
[SPEAKER_53]: Minority representation tends to improve under proportional multi-seat systems.

3372
04:55:04,891 --> 04:55:09,555
[SPEAKER_53]: They tend to be more competitive with more seats in contention per district.

3373
04:55:12,178 --> 04:55:16,061
[SPEAKER_53]: They create space for more than two parties, and they lower polarization.

3374
04:55:17,663 --> 04:55:20,565
[SPEAKER_53]: They tend to have less extremism in the general population.

3375
04:55:21,446 --> 04:55:31,455
[SPEAKER_53]: And the elected officials in multi-seat proportional representation systems tend to be more likely to problem solve with people from other parties or platforms, and they tend to maintain democratic norms.

3376
04:55:33,047 --> 04:55:45,892
[SPEAKER_53]: Winner-take-all elections, which only, sorry, winner-take-all single-seat elections, have a greater likelihood that a constituent's policy beliefs are not represented by their elected official.

3377
04:55:47,333 --> 04:55:48,854
[SPEAKER_53]: They are susceptible to gerrymandering.

3378
04:55:50,795 --> 04:55:58,818
[SPEAKER_53]: They uniquely disadvantage racial, ethnic, religious, and other political minorities, especially when they are not concentrated geographically.

3379
04:56:00,841 --> 04:56:02,766
[SPEAKER_53]: They also reduce political competition.

3380
04:56:03,929 --> 04:56:07,478
[SPEAKER_53]: They create safe zones by creating safe districts.

3381
04:56:09,150 --> 04:56:13,554
[SPEAKER_53]: They increase effective polarization, which is also called negative partisanship.

3382
04:56:13,594 --> 04:56:17,997
[SPEAKER_53]: And that means that voters from opposing parties don't just disagree with one another.

3383
04:56:18,418 --> 04:56:23,602
[SPEAKER_53]: They actually come to believe that people, voters from the other party are bad people.

3384
04:56:24,202 --> 04:56:36,012
[SPEAKER_53]: And I will say, I've read about this particular thing, negative partisanship, because it is an indication when you have high negative partisanship, it is an indication of a failing democracy.

3385
04:56:36,712 --> 04:56:45,563
[SPEAKER_53]: So we are beginning to have in America high levels of this effective polarization or negative partisanship, which is not a good sign.

3386
04:56:47,465 --> 04:56:48,106
[SPEAKER_53]: They are

3387
04:56:49,895 --> 04:56:51,216
[SPEAKER_53]: They're high stakes elections.

3388
04:56:52,397 --> 04:56:55,460
[SPEAKER_53]: Politicians are worse at problem solving.

3389
04:56:56,161 --> 04:56:57,823
[SPEAKER_53]: They're worse at maintaining democratic norms.

3390
04:56:58,243 --> 04:57:08,333
[SPEAKER_53]: And voters and politicians who lose in win or take all elections are less likely to trust democratic institutions and more likely to resort to violence.

3391
04:57:09,894 --> 04:57:15,498
[SPEAKER_53]: I'll just take one quote from one of the organizations that does this kind of research, the organization called Protect Democracy.

3392
04:57:15,999 --> 04:57:23,124
[SPEAKER_53]: It says, researchers are especially concerned about the use of winner-take-all elections in highly polarized and diverse societies like the United States.

3393
04:57:23,784 --> 04:57:35,333
[SPEAKER_53]: As one global study of democratization concluded, winner-take-all electoral systems are ill-advised for countries with deep ethnic, regional, religious, or other emotional and polarizing divisions.

3394
04:57:37,658 --> 04:57:45,380
[SPEAKER_53]: So if you've fallen asleep because of the wonkiness of all these terms, I'm going to tell you the conclusion.

3395
04:57:45,400 --> 04:57:47,881
[SPEAKER_53]: So this is the part to really pay attention to.

3396
04:57:48,921 --> 04:57:59,504
[SPEAKER_53]: Single-seat, first-past-the-post elections are known, according to experts and researchers, to be among the worst possible methods for getting people appropriately represented in politics.

3397
04:58:00,484 --> 04:58:02,485
[SPEAKER_53]: I'm going to rephrase it.

3398
04:58:03,604 --> 04:58:16,431
[SPEAKER_53]: Single-seat first-past-the-post elections, otherwise known as ward or district seats, are, according to most experts, known to be among the worst possible methods for political representation.

3399
04:58:18,047 --> 04:58:24,428
[SPEAKER_53]: Okay, I'm gonna guess that a lot of progressive heads are spinning around right now because this is not what you hear in progressive circles, right?

3400
04:58:25,569 --> 04:58:28,069
[SPEAKER_53]: We've been told that wards are better than at-large.

3401
04:58:28,089 --> 04:58:37,732
[SPEAKER_53]: So why is it that in America, research shows that ward-based is a better system at the city council level, right?

3402
04:58:38,132 --> 04:58:40,932
[SPEAKER_53]: And I think there are two important reasons why.

3403
04:58:41,893 --> 04:58:47,274
[SPEAKER_53]: One is the distinction between identity-based representation and policy-based representation.

3404
04:58:48,294 --> 04:58:50,696
[SPEAKER_53]: And the other one is historical redlining.

3405
04:58:52,176 --> 04:58:55,939
[SPEAKER_53]: So in America, we have a skewed understanding of what representation is.

3406
04:58:57,720 --> 04:59:00,821
[SPEAKER_53]: We think that to be represented, you elect someone similar to you.

3407
04:59:01,522 --> 04:59:03,383
[SPEAKER_53]: To have women's issues represented, you elect a woman.

3408
04:59:03,923 --> 04:59:08,586
[SPEAKER_53]: To have black or LGBTQ or immigrant issues represented, you elect someone from one of those groups.

3409
04:59:09,346 --> 04:59:12,368
[SPEAKER_53]: If you want to be represented in your city, you elect someone who lives in your ward.

3410
04:59:13,667 --> 04:59:19,812
[SPEAKER_53]: This is a fundamentally different understanding from what people in other countries understand to be the essence of representation.

3411
04:59:20,493 --> 04:59:31,402
[SPEAKER_53]: Now, I believe, and people in many other countries believe, that true representation politically is when you elect someone who is going to vote the way that you want them to vote on policy, because that is the job that you are electing them to do.

3412
04:59:32,641 --> 04:59:38,887
[SPEAKER_53]: The argument for wards is based almost entirely on an identity politics viewpoint.

3413
04:59:39,688 --> 04:59:50,399
[SPEAKER_53]: And this is also why most of the time in cities across America, it is typically Democrats and progressives who want more wards, and Republicans and pro-establishment people who want more at-large representation.

3414
04:59:51,941 --> 04:59:55,665
[SPEAKER_53]: Research on wards looks for outcomes based upon identity.

3415
04:59:57,300 --> 05:00:10,031
[SPEAKER_53]: You have to understand that ward representation research also exists in the reality of American cities that have had historic redlining, meaning that we force minorities to be concentrated in certain districts.

3416
05:00:13,393 --> 05:00:21,100
[SPEAKER_53]: From an identity politics perspective, wards hold up pretty well in research in cities that are highly geographically segregated.

3417
05:00:22,264 --> 05:00:26,868
[SPEAKER_53]: people from these historically underrepresented identities are in fact elected more often in these cities.

3418
05:00:28,310 --> 05:00:32,253
[SPEAKER_53]: There's not a lot of research on whether it's true from a policy perspective.

3419
05:00:32,794 --> 05:00:36,737
[SPEAKER_53]: In terms of policy representation, it would be good for more research to be done.

3420
05:00:38,207 --> 05:00:47,774
[SPEAKER_53]: But it's important to note that when minorities are spread throughout the population, word representation does not even do a good job of bringing in different identities.

3421
05:00:48,535 --> 05:00:50,957
[SPEAKER_53]: And in fact, it has shown to be the opposite.

3422
05:00:51,397 --> 05:00:57,261
[SPEAKER_53]: Multi-seat representation does a better job of electing representatives from minority communities than single-seat districts.

3423
05:00:58,442 --> 05:01:02,265
[SPEAKER_53]: So I think that's something that's important to understand.

3424
05:01:04,590 --> 05:01:06,432
[SPEAKER_53]: I think I will go ahead and stop here.

3425
05:01:07,732 --> 05:01:18,078
[SPEAKER_53]: Those are my main reasons why I'm very happy with the idea that we are going to have a nice even mix of award representation and at-large representation.

3426
05:01:19,159 --> 05:01:32,449
[SPEAKER_53]: I wrote a blog article for people who want more detail and who want to understand a little bit better and have some insight into what I actually have spent a lot of my time as my day job doing for the last eight years in terms of reinvigorating democracy.

3427
05:01:32,470 --> 05:01:33,831
[SPEAKER_53]: I'm not going to bore you with that here.

3428
05:01:33,871 --> 05:01:34,431
[SPEAKER_53]: It's late at night.

3429
05:01:34,491 --> 05:01:35,732
[SPEAKER_53]: It's, in fact, not even late at night.

3430
05:01:35,792 --> 05:01:36,633
[SPEAKER_53]: It's early in the morning.

3431
05:01:37,674 --> 05:01:40,776
[SPEAKER_53]: But you can see my blog for those things.

3432
05:01:41,136 --> 05:01:43,218
[SPEAKER_53]: I wanted to say a couple of things.

3433
05:01:43,498 --> 05:01:50,404
[SPEAKER_53]: A final point, one is just that most cities in Massachusetts have larger wards than we do.

3434
05:01:50,524 --> 05:02:01,173
[SPEAKER_53]: And there are many cities, I believe Somerville and Lowell are among them, that have wards that are twice our size, which basically means they are wards that are equal to the size of the district in the current city council proposal.

3435
05:02:01,894 --> 05:02:08,500
[SPEAKER_53]: The other thing I want to say is I find it quite frustrating that the dialogue in the city council meetings has turned into this.

3436
05:02:09,618 --> 05:02:13,821
[SPEAKER_53]: If you're for eight wards and three at large, then you are a good and righteous and virtuous person.

3437
05:02:14,201 --> 05:02:19,545
[SPEAKER_53]: But if you vote for four districts and five at large, then you're an evil, power-hungry, and dishonest person.

3438
05:02:20,305 --> 05:02:24,188
[SPEAKER_53]: And I want to mark this as that rhetoric

3439
05:02:25,188 --> 05:02:40,421
[SPEAKER_53]: is exactly the kind of polarization that we have come to in America, because we don't have very good electoral systems, and we have this, you know, effective political of a negative partisanship problem, right, this is what these things lead to.

3440
05:02:41,201 --> 05:02:43,724
[SPEAKER_53]: I am hoping that we can all try to

3441
05:02:44,384 --> 05:02:59,291
[SPEAKER_53]: to understand that we don't need to accuse others of being evil and bad, and hopefully also understand that the difference between—these are both hybrid systems—the difference between 8 and 3 and 4 and 5 is not a gigantic difference.

3442
05:02:59,631 --> 05:03:06,895
[SPEAKER_53]: I personally think that 4 and 5 is in fact better representation for all the reasons that I said, and I would love it if we can, you know,

3443
05:03:07,659 --> 05:03:13,382
[SPEAKER_53]: try and tone down a little bit the rhetoric that paints people as being bad people.

3444
05:03:14,203 --> 05:03:15,564
[SPEAKER_53]: So that's what I have to say.

3445
05:03:15,584 --> 05:03:16,024
[SPEAKER_53]: Thanks so much.

3446
05:03:17,285 --> 05:03:19,066
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you, Chancellor Callahan.

3447
05:03:19,126 --> 05:03:22,928
[SPEAKER_47]: And I really encourage folks to read the blog post.

3448
05:03:22,968 --> 05:03:30,752
[SPEAKER_47]: I read it earlier, so I felt comfortable stepping out for my first break in five hours, only because I had read what I thought you were going to say, and I think you said most of it.

3449
05:03:31,613 --> 05:03:36,436
[SPEAKER_47]: And I just wanted to say that I think the point

3450
05:03:37,358 --> 05:03:45,507
[SPEAKER_47]: especially about the fact that if you're in a 51-49 race and 51% wins and 49% loses, half of people feel pretty bad about that and don't feel represented.

3451
05:03:45,547 --> 05:03:45,607
[SPEAKER_47]: And

3452
05:03:54,811 --> 05:04:00,355
[SPEAKER_47]: you know, given the special act process that we're in, we can't look at models that really do address that more seriously.

3453
05:04:00,375 --> 05:04:10,862
[SPEAKER_47]: Um, but we can have a balance of having this winner take all single member district seats and having, um, the at large seats.

3454
05:04:11,142 --> 05:04:13,424
[SPEAKER_47]: So thank you, councilor Leming.

3455
05:04:13,884 --> 05:04:18,427
[SPEAKER_47]: And then Councilor Tseng, thank you.

3456
05:04:18,447 --> 05:04:20,128
[SPEAKER_41]: It's just a bit of housekeeping.

3457
05:04:20,589 --> 05:04:22,370
[SPEAKER_41]: I think it's something we discussed in a

3458
05:04:23,133 --> 05:04:31,500
[SPEAKER_41]: governance committee meeting and then sort of forgot about in section 8-4 ineligible measures number 12.

3459
05:04:32,641 --> 05:04:37,965
[SPEAKER_41]: It still says a change in the title of a city agency or multiple member body.

3460
05:04:37,985 --> 05:04:50,196
[SPEAKER_41]: I'd like to motion first to change that to a change in the title of a city agency or any body, department, division, office, or school of the Metro Public Schools.

3461
05:04:51,818 --> 05:04:56,960
[SPEAKER_41]: just because City agency does City agency does include multiple member bodies.

3462
05:04:56,980 --> 05:05:03,824
[SPEAKER_41]: So that's that's redundant, but it I don't believe I don't believe it includes the public school system.

3463
05:05:05,724 --> 05:05:06,505
[SPEAKER_41]: Yeah, yeah, I can.

3464
05:05:06,625 --> 05:05:07,225
[SPEAKER_41]: I can email that.

3465
05:05:07,945 --> 05:05:19,571
[SPEAKER_41]: Additionally, I just had also tack on to that just a motion to alphabetize the definition section because with the change to new initiative measure that now D alphabetizes the

3466
05:05:20,289 --> 05:05:24,812
[SPEAKER_41]: the definitions, and it's just kind of annoying me.

3467
05:05:24,872 --> 05:05:26,493
[SPEAKER_41]: So we should fix that.

3468
05:05:26,513 --> 05:05:29,194
[SPEAKER_41]: They need to be alphabetized.

3469
05:05:29,735 --> 05:05:33,857
[SPEAKER_35]: Yeah, now I'll just.

3470
05:06:06,549 --> 05:06:07,970
[SPEAKER_47]: Sorry, I thought my microphone was on.

3471
05:06:08,610 --> 05:06:11,992
[SPEAKER_47]: Okay, I think I understand where we're at here with the definitions.

3472
05:06:13,112 --> 05:06:14,213
[SPEAKER_47]: We can move those two around.

3473
05:06:22,225 --> 05:06:23,505
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

3474
05:06:23,825 --> 05:06:28,407
[SPEAKER_35]: I just wanted to thank Councilor Callaghan for sharing what she wrote.

3475
05:06:29,327 --> 05:06:51,714
[SPEAKER_35]: Again, what Councilor Callaghan wrote is about, you know, research that has been done for a very long time in this country, because, you know, we always seek to improve our electoral systems to better match both the identity, but also especially the policy objectives of our communities.

3476
05:06:53,859 --> 05:06:57,240
[SPEAKER_35]: I think what Councilor Callaghan wrote is super meaningful.

3477
05:06:57,661 --> 05:07:01,782
[SPEAKER_35]: It very much overlaps with a lot of the research I've done on this topic as well.

3478
05:07:02,322 --> 05:07:12,505
[SPEAKER_35]: And a lot of the conversations that I've had with political scientists and lawyers who are working on electoral systems, trying to make them more equitable.

3479
05:07:15,406 --> 05:07:18,087
[SPEAKER_35]: So I encourage everyone to read that post.

3480
05:07:19,951 --> 05:07:36,215
[SPEAKER_35]: I think another thing that I've been talking about too that I haven't gotten to mention tonight is the need, again, returning to the policy argument, the need to align our greater objectives with our local desires as well.

3481
05:07:36,295 --> 05:07:38,195
[SPEAKER_35]: And I think we see that a lot tonight.

3482
05:07:39,936 --> 05:07:49,798
[SPEAKER_35]: We've talked a lot about parochialism and how if we overly shift to another model of governance,

3483
05:07:50,275 --> 05:07:57,420
[SPEAKER_35]: that can create unintended consequences as well.

3484
05:07:57,760 --> 05:08:14,071
[SPEAKER_35]: And those consequences are what I've been phrasing as, it's really a democratic paradox, because you can have commitment to pro-housing policies, but yet still have a situation where every single neighborhood doesn't want that policy there.

3485
05:08:15,782 --> 05:08:26,724
[SPEAKER_35]: Um, the I believe the 4-5 balance by making it more more closer to half and half, um, allows for both sides of the argument to be heard and to be expressed and to be voted on.

3486
05:08:27,224 --> 05:08:31,865
[SPEAKER_35]: Um, and to not, you know, overly weigh the conversations in favor of one over the other.

3487
05:08:32,385 --> 05:08:40,087
[SPEAKER_35]: Um, I'll leave it there because there might be more to say with, um, after, but I think a lot has been said already.

3488
05:08:40,227 --> 05:08:40,927
[SPEAKER_35]: So thank you.

3489
05:08:42,648 --> 05:08:44,288
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you, Councilor Sagan.

3490
05:08:45,843 --> 05:08:54,806
[SPEAKER_47]: on the motion by Councilor Tseng to approve this draft as amended by Councilor Tseng and Councilor Leming and it's discussed.

3491
05:08:56,447 --> 05:08:57,727
[SPEAKER_47]: Is there any public comment?

3492
05:08:57,747 --> 05:09:02,849
[SPEAKER_47]: I have two, I'm gonna go to Gaston just because he has been standing up a while.

3493
05:09:05,410 --> 05:09:08,591
[SPEAKER_47]: Please raise your hand on Zoom or come to the podium in person.

3494
05:09:10,431 --> 05:09:11,972
[SPEAKER_47]: Gaston, name and address for the record, please.

3495
05:09:11,992 --> 05:09:12,592
[SPEAKER_47]: You have three minutes.

3496
05:09:12,612 --> 05:09:13,112
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3497
05:09:15,395 --> 05:09:17,457
[SPEAKER_38]: I just had a comment.

3498
05:09:17,737 --> 05:09:19,899
[SPEAKER_38]: I mean, I follow this process as much as I could.

3499
05:09:19,919 --> 05:09:22,362
[SPEAKER_38]: I think I had input in the areas.

3500
05:09:23,344 --> 05:09:25,125
[SPEAKER_38]: that were more concerning to me.

3501
05:09:25,186 --> 05:09:35,294
[SPEAKER_38]: And unfortunately, I didn't follow this as much as I would have liked to, but related to the number of city councilors, I'm still not convinced by the number nine.

3502
05:09:35,714 --> 05:09:46,463
[SPEAKER_38]: I think I sent an email because I couldn't come to the meeting where this was covered that I supported the proposal of President Bears.

3503
05:09:47,192 --> 05:09:54,035
[SPEAKER_38]: where the number was actually left at seven, and it had four district councilors and three at large.

3504
05:09:55,355 --> 05:09:58,697
[SPEAKER_38]: And I was very pleasantly to read your reasons, which was efficiency.

3505
05:09:58,757 --> 05:10:12,422
[SPEAKER_38]: Like, you know, we go from seven to nine, to me, the gain of just, you know, having five and four just doesn't, you know, we're gonna have to increase the cost of changing the council chamber.

3506
05:10:12,502 --> 05:10:16,264
[SPEAKER_38]: We have more councilors, more salary, and it's,

3507
05:10:17,264 --> 05:10:19,026
[SPEAKER_38]: Midnight, and 20 minutes.

3508
05:10:19,546 --> 05:10:21,867
[SPEAKER_38]: We're going to have two extra Councilors I have to talk.

3509
05:10:21,888 --> 05:10:24,169
[SPEAKER_38]: I mean you can see how this is.

3510
05:10:24,830 --> 05:10:27,051
[SPEAKER_38]: I just don't cut Councilor say it's time.

3511
05:10:29,673 --> 05:10:33,275
[SPEAKER_38]: I. Yeah, I mean I understand the ratio you know fight before.

3512
05:10:34,416 --> 05:10:48,782
[SPEAKER_38]: It's a little bit more even in particularly if you want more Councilors at large compared to three to four, but I'm, you know, there's other things I could have done like for example, I don't know, changing the words a little bit and maybe reduce the, you know, the district number and put it like four and three.

3513
05:10:50,903 --> 05:10:56,347
[SPEAKER_38]: So yeah, I mean, I still support your idea, Mr. President.

3514
05:10:56,367 --> 05:10:57,548
[SPEAKER_38]: Just the two of us, my friend.

3515
05:10:57,628 --> 05:11:09,596
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, I just think that nine is just going to introduce some things not desirable and it's really not going to make a difference compared to just leaving it at seven with four district councilors and three at large.

3516
05:11:10,016 --> 05:11:14,940
[SPEAKER_47]: Personally, I love the idea of putting our two least favorite colleagues at the little desks on the side.

3517
05:11:17,021 --> 05:11:18,202
[SPEAKER_47]: That's a complete joke.

3518
05:11:18,422 --> 05:11:18,902
[SPEAKER_47]: I mean, hey,

3519
05:11:21,195 --> 05:11:24,398
[SPEAKER_47]: I am all in favor of the original proposal.

3520
05:11:24,438 --> 05:11:27,981
[SPEAKER_47]: I think it basically is similar to what we have now, just the balances.

3521
05:11:28,081 --> 05:11:28,862
[SPEAKER_47]: It's still balanced.

3522
05:11:28,922 --> 05:11:30,543
[SPEAKER_47]: It's just balanced the other way a little bit.

3523
05:11:32,245 --> 05:11:41,533
[SPEAKER_47]: And you save, I think you have the same composition of both bodies and you don't have to maybe do a renovation in this room and maybe you don't have people speaking longer.

3524
05:11:41,673 --> 05:11:42,453
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm right there with you.

3525
05:11:42,854 --> 05:11:44,135
[SPEAKER_47]: I seriously think we might be the only two.

3526
05:11:45,010 --> 05:11:46,631
[SPEAKER_47]: the city who are 100% there.

3527
05:11:46,651 --> 05:11:51,674
[SPEAKER_47]: I hope I probably wrong on that, but certainly we're the only two have really spoken on it.

3528
05:11:51,974 --> 05:12:02,961
[SPEAKER_47]: I don't want to represent everyone else, but I'm pretty sure basically the reason it went up to the nine is that the study committee said a larger council would be more in line with what other cities have.

3529
05:12:04,242 --> 05:12:07,284
[SPEAKER_47]: If anyone else wants to speak to that, I'm yeah.

3530
05:12:07,604 --> 05:12:08,445
[SPEAKER_47]: Councilor Callahan.

3531
05:12:10,166 --> 05:12:12,247
[SPEAKER_53]: It's about number of constituents per councilor, I believe.

3532
05:12:14,519 --> 05:12:14,779
[SPEAKER_47]: Okay.

3533
05:12:15,139 --> 05:12:15,379
[SPEAKER_47]: Okay.

3534
05:12:15,740 --> 05:12:28,031
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, I'm okay and the last comment is that I would have preferred, I will mature I prefer and then I send an email to the mid for charter study, I did it, I made a comment about this when they when they were collecting.

3535
05:12:28,799 --> 05:12:33,583
[SPEAKER_38]: information ranked as voting and they explained to me very well why it wasn't covered.

3536
05:12:34,043 --> 05:12:39,607
[SPEAKER_38]: But to everyone listening out there, I might actually be pushing for this in the future.

3537
05:12:40,067 --> 05:12:45,371
[SPEAKER_38]: So if anyone is interested and would like to join forces, then I'm looking forward.

3538
05:12:45,692 --> 05:12:45,932
[SPEAKER_47]: Cool.

3539
05:12:48,328 --> 05:12:53,411
[SPEAKER_47]: And I will say again, this process allows for a lot more frequent review.

3540
05:12:53,851 --> 05:13:02,955
[SPEAKER_47]: This charter, if it passes, there's a frequent review process included within it, and hopefully we could look at stuff like rank choice and other items, proportional, et cetera.

3541
05:13:03,836 --> 05:13:04,516
[SPEAKER_47]: Great, thank you.

3542
05:13:04,536 --> 05:13:07,378
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record, please.

3543
05:13:07,398 --> 05:13:07,918
[SPEAKER_47]: You have three minutes.

3544
05:13:08,538 --> 05:13:11,139
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, this is Matthew Page Lieberman, 15 Connell Street.

3545
05:13:12,440 --> 05:13:15,902
[SPEAKER_26]: I have kind of lamented some of the rhetoric

3546
05:13:16,597 --> 05:13:22,563
[SPEAKER_26]: by people about the nefarious motives of councillors to want to consider another model.

3547
05:13:23,043 --> 05:13:38,778
[SPEAKER_26]: I felt that with the budget, there were certain things that were really presented about why we should do the overrides, but that there were some conversations online, there were some things communicated here, but still there were residents who kind of felt like the case isn't really

3548
05:13:39,418 --> 05:13:40,059
[SPEAKER_26]: being made.

3549
05:13:40,699 --> 05:13:50,928
[SPEAKER_26]: So there have been some comments made here and there are referencing research, and so I was extremely happy today to see Representative Callahan's post a lot of things.

3550
05:13:51,588 --> 05:13:56,092
[SPEAKER_26]: I agree with this, particularly about multi member districts.

3551
05:13:56,632 --> 05:14:03,038
[SPEAKER_26]: And if we really think about it, a presidency or a mayor's office, a single member district, we will wind up seeing a lot of these.

3552
05:14:03,758 --> 05:14:05,380
[SPEAKER_26]: The perils about how even

3553
05:14:06,140 --> 05:14:20,024
[SPEAKER_26]: Even with ruling coalitions and parliaments, how they work together when they try to capitalize on the presidency with the coattail work with them, we can wind up seeing the polarization within legislatures as well because of the executive.

3554
05:14:21,024 --> 05:14:26,246
[SPEAKER_26]: So, you know, perhaps someday we can consider about multi-member presidencies, multi-member mayors.

3555
05:14:28,387 --> 05:14:34,269
[SPEAKER_26]: So I think that there are trade-offs about everything rather than seeing anything superior.

3556
05:14:34,289 --> 05:14:42,633
[SPEAKER_26]: I think a lot of times we should consider the trade-offs or the trade-offs of this or that, and I don't know if that was really kind of made clear.

3557
05:14:42,993 --> 05:14:44,934
[SPEAKER_26]: If we think about a council kind of as a

3558
05:14:45,774 --> 05:14:52,321
[SPEAKER_26]: meeting is like a court case, you know, they're like attorneys, basically, tell the judge what they'll present.

3559
05:14:52,662 --> 05:15:02,532
[SPEAKER_26]: A lot of times, it seems like while people are wonks, and this is great to present stuff at the moment, it's more ideal to kind of present things and more transparency.

3560
05:15:02,753 --> 05:15:06,377
[SPEAKER_26]: This is the data that I'll be presenting this evening for the people can look over.

3561
05:15:06,917 --> 05:15:11,581
[SPEAKER_26]: I think that going with trade offs, there is a trade off as far as adopting the district model.

3562
05:15:12,382 --> 05:15:20,890
[SPEAKER_26]: Some things were not selected because of the worries about the legislature, not wanting, you know, feeling that was complicated, and that as well with the district model.

3563
05:15:21,591 --> 05:15:25,975
[SPEAKER_26]: When we consider the possible disagreement with the mayor, the lack of support

3564
05:15:26,535 --> 05:15:39,878
[SPEAKER_26]: because of rhetoric with the community, and the kind of results that that could be in less people wanting to mobilize for the passage of the charter or for testifying and hearing for the home rule petition.

3565
05:15:39,918 --> 05:15:41,198
[SPEAKER_26]: So those are just all.

3566
05:15:41,998 --> 05:15:43,179
[SPEAKER_26]: I hope the charter passes.

3567
05:15:43,339 --> 05:15:44,439
[SPEAKER_26]: I like the district model.

3568
05:15:44,459 --> 05:15:45,539
[SPEAKER_26]: I think the arguments have been made.

3569
05:15:45,799 --> 05:15:49,020
[SPEAKER_26]: But I think we should still be honest about the risks that are made.

3570
05:15:50,400 --> 05:15:57,203
[SPEAKER_26]: by doing it, and when there could possibly be disagreement and lack of public support at this late stage in the game.

3571
05:15:57,703 --> 05:15:58,163
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

3572
05:15:59,684 --> 05:16:00,024
[SPEAKER_47]: All right.

3573
05:16:00,044 --> 05:16:02,465
[SPEAKER_47]: You coming up?

3574
05:16:03,586 --> 05:16:04,126
[SPEAKER_47]: Oh, boy.

3575
05:16:04,146 --> 05:16:06,727
[SPEAKER_47]: David and Tress are working.

3576
05:16:07,567 --> 05:16:09,488
[SPEAKER_47]: You have three minutes.

3577
05:16:13,145 --> 05:16:14,948
[SPEAKER_43]: Hi, Sam Goldstein, 29 Martin Street.

3578
05:16:15,108 --> 05:16:17,711
[SPEAKER_43]: I just wanted to speak in favor of passing this.

3579
05:16:17,771 --> 05:16:31,808
[SPEAKER_43]: I think that, you know, Anna, through the president, Councilor Callahan's explanation of, you know, the present cons of various systems was very informative and enlightening.

3580
05:16:33,433 --> 05:16:36,735
[SPEAKER_43]: And yeah, I mean, I think there's a good rationale for that.

3581
05:16:36,775 --> 05:16:39,876
[SPEAKER_43]: I think there's a lot of other good stuff in this charter that we should be excited about.

3582
05:16:39,896 --> 05:16:50,141
[SPEAKER_43]: I think we're passing a new charter for the first time in decades, many decades, a few decades.

3583
05:16:50,181 --> 05:16:51,722
[SPEAKER_43]: It's been- 39 years.

3584
05:16:51,742 --> 05:16:54,283
[SPEAKER_43]: Yeah, it's four decades about.

3585
05:16:55,083 --> 05:16:57,665
[SPEAKER_43]: So, that's a big step.

3586
05:16:57,865 --> 05:17:00,406
[SPEAKER_43]: And I think that this council and this city should be

3587
05:17:01,227 --> 05:17:02,207
[SPEAKER_43]: Very excited about that.

3588
05:17:02,247 --> 05:17:18,155
[SPEAKER_43]: I think a lot of bit and hay has been made over some fairly small differences that at the end of the day, I think will produce what will end up being very similar outcomes with, yeah, not to go back there.

3589
05:17:18,395 --> 05:17:19,776
[SPEAKER_43]: Anyway, congratulations.

3590
05:17:20,196 --> 05:17:22,137
[SPEAKER_43]: Assuming this passes, looking forward to it.

3591
05:17:24,098 --> 05:17:24,438
[SPEAKER_43]: One minute.

3592
05:17:25,375 --> 05:17:26,756
[SPEAKER_26]: There's something I forgot to say.

3593
05:17:26,896 --> 05:17:31,940
[SPEAKER_26]: So as far as this hyper-partisanship, there's also, you know, threat of demagogues.

3594
05:17:31,960 --> 05:17:38,425
[SPEAKER_26]: A lot of people take a look at this stuff from 1920s, they think was first articulated, but actually ancient Greeks even went upon this.

3595
05:17:38,465 --> 05:17:41,967
[SPEAKER_26]: And there's no system that kind of insulates us from the rise of demagogues.

3596
05:17:42,007 --> 05:17:43,788
[SPEAKER_26]: However, there are things that we know.

3597
05:17:44,229 --> 05:17:48,652
[SPEAKER_26]: And that is like, if you even similarly, this is tangential, but if you take a look at ancient Egypt,

3598
05:17:49,132 --> 05:17:59,796
[SPEAKER_26]: when you have these pantheistic gods, a temporary point in which there was an emperor, a king who said, we will have a monotheism, in which things became more rigid.

3599
05:18:00,576 --> 05:18:02,297
[SPEAKER_26]: And that's just, that's kind of a fact.

3600
05:18:02,317 --> 05:18:05,138
[SPEAKER_26]: When we have one individual, you're either for or against.

3601
05:18:05,298 --> 05:18:15,542
[SPEAKER_26]: And yeah, we should definitely move away from this, including what Councilor Callahan said today about when there's a ward, there's one person, and you feel that person's going to ignore you.

3602
05:18:16,142 --> 05:18:18,584
[SPEAKER_26]: that really removes a lot of options from people.

3603
05:18:18,604 --> 05:18:21,807
[SPEAKER_26]: They say, well, Trump, these Republicans, I'm a Democrat, they'll never listen to me.

3604
05:18:22,087 --> 05:18:23,809
[SPEAKER_26]: I shouldn't even talk to my representative.

3605
05:18:24,069 --> 05:18:30,774
[SPEAKER_26]: That creates massive problems when people feel that there's nobody that represents them that will listen to them because they're enemies.

3606
05:18:31,715 --> 05:18:32,075
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

3607
05:18:34,357 --> 05:18:34,638
[SPEAKER_47]: All right.

3608
05:18:35,038 --> 05:18:43,045
[SPEAKER_47]: On the motion of Councilor Tseng, as amended by Councilor Tseng and Councilor Leming and seconded by, who do we have as a second?

3609
05:18:44,245 --> 05:18:45,386
[SPEAKER_47]: I know but we might already have one.

3610
05:18:45,406 --> 05:18:52,670
[SPEAKER_47]: I think I just want to make sure it was Vice President Collins, sorry.

3611
05:18:57,552 --> 05:19:00,694
[SPEAKER_47]: Nope, it's Vice President Collins, nobody else.

3612
05:19:01,534 --> 05:19:02,395
[SPEAKER_47]: You're going in those chairs.

3613
05:19:03,776 --> 05:19:08,778
[SPEAKER_47]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

3614
05:19:13,918 --> 05:19:18,942
[SPEAKER_46]: Vice President Collins, Councilor Lazzaro, Councilor Leming.

[SPEAKER_46]: Councilor Tseng.

3617
05:19:27,850 --> 05:19:27,990
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes.

05:19:28,411 --> 05:19:29,071
[SPEAKER_46]: President Bears.

3619
05:19:29,231 --> 05:19:29,432

[SPEAKER_47]: The affirmative.

3621

[SPEAKER_47]: One absent.

3622
05:19:30,993 --> 05:19:31,774
[SPEAKER_47]: The motion passes.

3623
05:19:36,753 --> 05:19:56,083

3625
05:20:01,471 --> 05:20:02,852
[SPEAKER_47]: Nope, I gotta read the whole thing.

3626

[SPEAKER_47]: For consideration in a committee of the whole meeting next Tuesday, March 18th at 6pm.
