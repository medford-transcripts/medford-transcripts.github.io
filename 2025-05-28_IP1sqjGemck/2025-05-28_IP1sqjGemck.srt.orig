[SPEAKER_03]: the Metro Public Schools and our Department of Public Works.

[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to start with the police department.

19
00:22:26,132 --> 00:22:26,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, Tim.

20
00:22:27,773 --> 00:22:31,815
[SPEAKER_03]: There's really no winning.

21
00:22:31,835 --> 00:22:32,235
Oh God.

22
00:22:47,702 --> 00:22:47,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

23
00:22:48,022 --> 00:22:49,242
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll recognize the chief of staff.

24
00:22:49,282 --> 00:22:51,783
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you could just introduce the team and then we'll get going.

25
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:52,803
[SPEAKER_00]: I was happy to.

26
00:22:52,823 --> 00:22:55,044
[SPEAKER_00]: Nina Nazarian, chief of staff.

27
00:22:55,224 --> 00:22:58,985
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just here to present the members of the police department who are gonna present this evening.

28
00:22:59,585 --> 00:23:01,206
[SPEAKER_00]: The chief has a family matter.

29
00:23:01,266 --> 00:23:02,786
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's unable to attend, unfortunately.

30
00:23:03,266 --> 00:23:04,487
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Captain Clemente here.

31
00:23:04,827 --> 00:23:12,029
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Lieutenant Gagliardi, and I know that we have Captain Covino as well, and other members of the department, including Captain Brooks.

32
00:23:13,049 --> 00:23:14,830
[SPEAKER_00]: And Sergeant Gilbreath here as well.

33
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:15,950
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.

34
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:16,910
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

35
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:26,696
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, I'm just going to read quickly from the budget and then I'm going to kind of give you three general framing questions and then we'll go to questions from councillors after your presentation.

36
00:23:27,797 --> 00:23:38,644
[SPEAKER_03]: So tonight we have the Medford Police Department budget and for fiscal 25, this is a lot of line items, it's going to take me a minute to find it.

37
00:23:39,638 --> 00:23:42,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Fiscal 25, we had a $14,632,263 and proposed for fiscal 26 $15,177,397 for an increase of $545,134.

38
00:23:42,479 --> 00:23:46,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of these changes are in fixed cost growth, highlighting $119,000 for step increases in promotion.

39
00:24:04,268 --> 00:24:17,334
[SPEAKER_03]: and promotions, about $90,000 in overtime, $47,000 for differential, $50,000 in fringe, $62,000 in holiday pay, and then various inflationary costs.

40
00:24:18,115 --> 00:24:22,857
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have new expenses, $25,000 for legal costs, $5,000 for training.

41
00:24:23,877 --> 00:24:29,640
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that, the three questions are just tell me more about that budget, what you want to talk about,

42
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:40,266
[SPEAKER_03]: talk a bit about your highlights for fiscal 25 for the past year, goals for next year, and then let us know something that might not be in the budget this year that you'd like to see included in the future.

43
00:24:41,807 --> 00:24:46,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the first thing I wanted to talk about was the number of offices that we are looking for.

44
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:47,230
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking for 107.

45
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:49,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Currently, we have 90.

46
00:24:49,432 --> 00:24:53,134
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just been through retirements.

47
00:24:53,194 --> 00:24:54,455
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had a lot of retirements.

48
00:24:54,475 --> 00:24:55,555
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had some people leave.

49
00:24:57,089 --> 00:25:04,851
[SPEAKER_02]: The good news is we do have three in the academy that are going to be retiring next, not retiring, hopefully they're not retiring.

50
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:09,112
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll be, sure.

51
00:25:09,352 --> 00:25:12,993
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll be graduating next week, in a week and a half.

52
00:25:13,473 --> 00:25:15,273
[SPEAKER_02]: So it'll bring our total up to 93.

53
00:25:15,893 --> 00:25:20,754
[SPEAKER_02]: So currently we, we're striving to get closer to that 107 number.

54
00:25:21,455 --> 00:25:22,435
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying very hard.

55
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:29,403
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually have a, actually police interviews tomorrow, as a matter of fact, and we're moving forward.

56
00:25:29,443 --> 00:25:31,184
[SPEAKER_02]: Captain Brooks is heading that up.

57
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:37,427
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's also a hiring model that is in compliance with civil service rules.

58
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:45,711
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are aggressively looking to place eight in an academy in Plymouth in October, and that will bring our compliment up.

59
00:25:46,631 --> 00:25:50,733
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, in February, we're probably looking to put another six on in February.

60
00:25:51,574 --> 00:25:53,116
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we'll get close.

61
00:25:53,416 --> 00:25:55,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, we're gonna have some retirements next year.

62
00:25:55,358 --> 00:25:59,942
[SPEAKER_02]: So it seems like every time we get ahead, we have some retirements and yours truly.

63
00:26:01,763 --> 00:26:02,124
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

64
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:03,005
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say it ain't so.

65
00:26:04,186 --> 00:26:05,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's so.

66
00:26:06,428 --> 00:26:07,329
[SPEAKER_02]: They kicked me out.

67
00:26:07,509 --> 00:26:09,090
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.

68
00:26:09,831 --> 00:26:13,554
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what we're looking at as far as like our numbers right now.

69
00:26:14,115 --> 00:26:17,478
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're feeling pretty good, pretty positive about that.

70
00:26:18,771 --> 00:26:24,655
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd certainly like to publicly commend our officers, our detectives, and our dispatchers for the job they're doing.

71
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:27,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Doing a fantastic job, very professional.

72
00:26:28,418 --> 00:26:30,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Every year our calls for service go up.

73
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:33,962
[SPEAKER_02]: And this year it's well over 30,000 calls that they get.

74
00:26:34,683 --> 00:26:38,545
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of them are 911 emergency calls as well.

75
00:26:39,506 --> 00:26:43,029
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a rising number of mental health interactions as well with those calls.

76
00:26:43,729 --> 00:26:47,792
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're very fortunate to have a clinician program

77
00:26:48,595 --> 00:26:52,619
[SPEAKER_02]: And Lieutenant Gagliardi wrote a grant for the Department of Mental Health.

78
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,121
[SPEAKER_02]: We have currently three clinicians.

79
00:26:55,241 --> 00:26:57,884
[SPEAKER_02]: One's on leave right now, but hopefully will be coming back soon.

80
00:26:58,464 --> 00:27:00,126
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's part of a co-response unit.

81
00:27:01,227 --> 00:27:02,749
[SPEAKER_02]: And these clinicians are fantastic.

82
00:27:03,149 --> 00:27:10,075
[SPEAKER_02]: If you had told me years ago that we're gonna have civilians helping in behavioral areas, I would have said, that's absolutely never gonna happen.

83
00:27:10,516 --> 00:27:12,458
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's how we've changed and we've grown.

84
00:27:12,991 --> 00:27:13,871
[SPEAKER_02]: throughout the years.

85
00:27:14,291 --> 00:27:22,314
[SPEAKER_02]: These clinicians are trained to assess individuals on scene, provide immediate support, implement de-escalation strategies and crisis intervention.

86
00:27:22,754 --> 00:27:30,436
[SPEAKER_02]: They're also equipped to determine whether an individual's condition warrants hospitalization or can be addressed through alternative services.

87
00:27:31,556 --> 00:27:41,039
[SPEAKER_02]: Beyond emergency response, clinicians conduct follow-up outreach to individuals and families affected by mental health or substance use issues, offering continued support

88
00:27:41,527 --> 00:27:43,088
[SPEAKER_02]: and connecting them to appropriate care.

89
00:27:43,589 --> 00:27:50,554
[SPEAKER_02]: They're a vital, vital component with our efforts to enhance public safety and it reduces the risk of adverse outcomes.

90
00:27:51,414 --> 00:27:55,898
[SPEAKER_02]: And people receive compassionate, professional and effective care.

91
00:27:56,898 --> 00:28:03,143
[SPEAKER_02]: Continued investment in this unit supports our broader goals of community wellness, officer safety and resource efficiency.

92
00:28:04,524 --> 00:28:08,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Lieutenant Gagliardi wrote the grant again and we're hoping the funding's there.

93
00:28:10,521 --> 00:28:13,803
[SPEAKER_02]: We should find out relatively soon if that funding's there.

94
00:28:13,843 --> 00:28:17,525
[SPEAKER_02]: We're hoping it, we're praying it's there because it's such a vital program.

95
00:28:19,966 --> 00:28:25,108
[SPEAKER_02]: We maintain a commitment to provide for the safety and wellbeing of our own police officers as well.

96
00:28:25,549 --> 00:28:30,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Chief Buckley has put into place some, a peer support unit.

97
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:36,875
[SPEAKER_02]: It requires us to provide training, equipment, support, mental and physical resources.

98
00:28:36,935 --> 00:28:39,756
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to take care of our own officers so they can take care of the public.

99
00:28:41,037 --> 00:28:43,258
[SPEAKER_02]: Our employees are our most important asset.

100
00:28:44,198 --> 00:28:53,500
[SPEAKER_02]: Stress and physical health are epidemic problems in policing around the world, around the country, both for the officers and dispatchers.

101
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,501
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have training, peer support.

102
00:28:56,921 --> 00:28:58,141
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lot of training.

103
00:28:58,181 --> 00:29:01,222
[SPEAKER_02]: The courses that we put on are stress-related.

104
00:29:02,102 --> 00:29:05,143
[SPEAKER_02]: We put on the dangers of suicide.

105
00:29:05,883 --> 00:29:08,424
[SPEAKER_02]: We put on mental health courses and first aid.

106
00:29:08,464 --> 00:29:10,244
[SPEAKER_02]: We do de-escalation techniques.

107
00:29:11,714 --> 00:29:15,577
[SPEAKER_02]: We also do crisis intervention training.

108
00:29:16,377 --> 00:29:17,498
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a lot of training.

109
00:29:17,538 --> 00:29:20,361
[SPEAKER_02]: We're well-vested in keeping our officers well-trained.

110
00:29:22,762 --> 00:29:29,988
[SPEAKER_02]: And just one more thing about those officers, those soon-to-be officers that are graduating the academy.

111
00:29:30,529 --> 00:29:35,653
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as they graduate, they'll be in an FTO program that's actually headed by Lieutenant McGilvery.

112
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:39,476
[SPEAKER_02]: And for a couple of months, they'll be out there riding with seasoned officers,

113
00:29:40,317 --> 00:29:48,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, learning how to use our report writing system, learning how to take calls, um, just being shown everything there is to know about Medford.

114
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,661
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a, it's a really good program.

115
00:29:50,701 --> 00:29:56,142
[SPEAKER_02]: So about two or three months, they'll be doing that and then we'll have them to, to be able to, uh, to put out on their own.

116
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:58,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we're still on track.

117
00:29:59,035 --> 00:30:02,419
[SPEAKER_02]: for the state accreditation from the State Accreditation Commission.

118
00:30:02,879 --> 00:30:04,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, this is Lieutenant Harry McGilvery.

119
00:30:04,961 --> 00:30:05,842
[SPEAKER_02]: He's in charge of that.

120
00:30:06,703 --> 00:30:09,405
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an extensive, extensive project.

121
00:30:11,487 --> 00:30:17,593
[SPEAKER_02]: This basically is our department coming in line with the standards and best practices for police agencies.

122
00:30:18,271 --> 00:30:20,992
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good for liability purpose and for professionalism.

123
00:30:21,732 --> 00:30:30,254
[SPEAKER_02]: It's exhaustive and definitely establishes more directives and more policies and procedures for our personnel to follow.

124
00:30:30,314 --> 00:30:32,754
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's moving along pretty well with that.

125
00:30:33,195 --> 00:30:37,215
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm expecting that in this next year that it's going to happen.

126
00:30:38,576 --> 00:30:40,616
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been moving pretty strong with that.

127
00:30:40,656 --> 00:30:42,137
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a lot of policies in place.

128
00:30:42,177 --> 00:30:43,557
[SPEAKER_02]: He's put a lot of work into this.

129
00:30:43,937 --> 00:30:45,177
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're looking forward to that.

130
00:30:46,098 --> 00:30:47,278
[SPEAKER_02]: I mentioned training.

131
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:54,316
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, another short-term goal and actually long-term as well, a community engagement unit.

132
00:30:55,457 --> 00:31:00,561
[SPEAKER_02]: As everyone knows, we've been, we have National Night Out.

133
00:31:00,701 --> 00:31:01,682
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming up in August.

134
00:31:01,982 --> 00:31:04,044
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a personal invite for everybody to come down there.

135
00:31:05,124 --> 00:31:11,730
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good time to meet some of the officers, see how the officers interact with, you know, with the families and the kids.

136
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,372
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of family-oriented things down there.

137
00:31:15,705 --> 00:31:19,187
[SPEAKER_02]: We have other things such as Community Inclusion Day, which we just had.

138
00:31:19,967 --> 00:31:27,410
[SPEAKER_02]: It provides individuals with autism and other disabilities a chance to meet the police officers.

139
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:28,590
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Touch-a-Truck there.

140
00:31:28,931 --> 00:31:32,012
[SPEAKER_02]: We just had this a couple weeks ago and it worked out very, very well.

141
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:34,873
[SPEAKER_02]: We always do a Thanksgiving food drive.

142
00:31:34,913 --> 00:31:36,414
[SPEAKER_02]: We do a holiday toy drive.

143
00:31:39,694 --> 00:31:44,938
[SPEAKER_02]: We just did a charity hockey game with the fire department, raised $10,000 for Make-A-Wish.

144
00:31:45,558 --> 00:31:46,919
[SPEAKER_02]: Police won that game, by the way.

145
00:31:48,541 --> 00:31:50,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Movie night, we just had that as well.

146
00:31:50,843 --> 00:31:51,663
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a big hit.

147
00:31:51,683 --> 00:31:53,204
[SPEAKER_02]: And we always have coffee with a cop.

148
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:55,046
[SPEAKER_02]: We have several of them throughout the year.

149
00:31:55,106 --> 00:31:58,709
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're continuing with that and moving with that.

150
00:31:58,729 --> 00:32:03,112
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, that invite, we'd love to see you guys there down there at that.

151
00:32:03,353 --> 00:32:04,413
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it's August 5th.

152
00:32:06,395 --> 00:32:07,556
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, our body camera.

153
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:09,734
[SPEAKER_02]: program is still going on.

154
00:32:09,754 --> 00:32:11,696
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no issues with that.

155
00:32:11,736 --> 00:32:13,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything's been working very well with that.

156
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:20,724
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are kind of the long-term and short-term goals that we have, that we've been doing, and we look forward to continuing them.

157
00:32:22,165 --> 00:32:30,612
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's any other questions in regards to the budget itself, I think with all of us here, we can certainly answer, you know, some of those questions that you might have.

158
00:32:31,733 --> 00:32:36,597
[SPEAKER_02]: One more thing, we have dispatcher interviews as well tomorrow, because we are down at dispatcher as well.

159
00:32:37,607 --> 00:32:40,290
[SPEAKER_02]: and may soon be down to two dispatches.

160
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:44,814
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're actually conducting interviews on that tomorrow, along with the police interviews.

161
00:32:45,495 --> 00:32:47,657
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're looking forward to getting that up to speed as well.

162
00:32:49,138 --> 00:32:57,446
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of a snapshot of the health of the department right now, as far as manpower and some of the short term and long term goals that we have.

163
00:32:58,915 --> 00:32:59,115
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

164
00:32:59,255 --> 00:32:59,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Captain.

165
00:32:59,916 --> 00:33:00,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

166
00:33:00,377 --> 00:33:04,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Gonna go to Councilor Scarpelli and then Councilor Leme.

167
00:33:05,182 --> 00:33:06,083
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Council President.

168
00:33:07,064 --> 00:33:07,685
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

169
00:33:07,705 --> 00:33:08,346
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

170
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:14,092
[SPEAKER_08]: First of all, I want to thank the team

171
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:18,654
[SPEAKER_08]: And what method police has done the city of Medford I know it's been very contentious.

172
00:33:19,435 --> 00:33:30,549
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's been a lot of not a lot of unsettled thoughts, and the chief has always been attentive, and his team has always been there to answer any questions at least.

173
00:33:31,396 --> 00:33:33,298
[SPEAKER_08]: from what I hear everybody on this council.

174
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:37,183
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I want to really thank you guys for everybody.

175
00:33:37,243 --> 00:33:44,191
[SPEAKER_08]: The team has done such an amazing job because it is difficult what's happening and your professionalism stands out.

176
00:33:44,552 --> 00:33:46,534
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that that's admirable.

177
00:33:50,133 --> 00:33:53,595
[SPEAKER_08]: you've seen the different issues that have come about, right?

178
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:54,996
[SPEAKER_08]: Internal issues.

179
00:33:55,057 --> 00:33:59,740
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember the contentiousness between the dispatchers and who's doing this and who's doing that.

180
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:03,663
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's been so settled now and you hear such a strength now.

181
00:34:04,223 --> 00:34:12,429
[SPEAKER_08]: And you see the different concerns when you talk about race issues and you talk about other issues that are happening throughout the country.

182
00:34:13,229 --> 00:34:16,752
[SPEAKER_08]: And what I love to see is that our department has stood above it all.

183
00:34:17,534 --> 00:34:24,197
[SPEAKER_08]: and really with their arms open, welcomed everybody in and saying, hey, listen, let's have a cup of coffee with a cop, right?

184
00:34:24,517 --> 00:34:27,678
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's hold special events and programs for kids with autism.

185
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:29,259
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go into the community.

186
00:34:29,279 --> 00:34:32,260
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's have an open dialogue with anybody that comes to the chief's office.

187
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:38,223
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why I think the chief is so special because he'll say it all the time, but he talks, he walks the walk.

188
00:34:38,883 --> 00:34:42,325
[SPEAKER_08]: When he says, I'm always here to speak, just let me know.

189
00:34:43,066 --> 00:34:43,466
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll come up.

190
00:34:43,506 --> 00:34:44,546
[SPEAKER_08]: He doesn't hide from anybody.

191
00:34:44,606 --> 00:34:45,507
[SPEAKER_08]: He stands right there.

192
00:34:46,087 --> 00:34:48,207
[SPEAKER_08]: And I take it the same from his whole team.

193
00:34:48,948 --> 00:34:56,169
[SPEAKER_08]: And I want to just commend you for that, because I think it's important that where there's good, there's some bad.

194
00:34:57,110 --> 00:35:05,092
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm proud to say that our Methodist Police Department has done nothing but made a great example on how we should act.

195
00:35:07,558 --> 00:35:17,903
[SPEAKER_08]: You're content that the issues that we're seeing right now then, you know, working in Somerville, we just saw their four year contract, just catch up for three years, they got a three year contract.

196
00:35:18,644 --> 00:35:25,087
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think it was 14% with some concessions and they got some hikes and some other side, some other little things but they

197
00:35:25,567 --> 00:35:51,732
[SPEAKER_08]: they understood the whole they they talked about the you know flag men and making sure that our officers and our retirees come first and then open it up for the flag people and I I see that's happening and I I I'm just a little concerned that as we're moving forward what happened over there they're down now no more community policing officers are leaving to neighborhood neighboring communities because they don't feel like

198
00:35:52,531 --> 00:35:57,435
[SPEAKER_08]: they're being supported, not by their team in-house, but the administration.

199
00:35:58,216 --> 00:36:00,098
[SPEAKER_08]: And money talks, unfortunately, right?

200
00:36:00,651 --> 00:36:08,453
[SPEAKER_08]: when you're working four years without a contract, three years without a contract, you still got to support your family and inflation and cost of living now.

201
00:36:09,073 --> 00:36:12,735
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that's my, how is the team handling so far?

202
00:36:13,415 --> 00:36:16,336
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, not, not having a contract for a few years.

203
00:36:16,396 --> 00:36:24,938
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it, do we hear any, um, is the morale still, still as expected or everyone's professional, right?

204
00:36:25,078 --> 00:36:27,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, they go out, they do their job and, um,

205
00:36:28,742 --> 00:36:29,602
[SPEAKER_02]: And they do a good job.

206
00:36:30,143 --> 00:36:34,204
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a situation where everything's increasing.

207
00:36:34,264 --> 00:36:35,685
[SPEAKER_02]: The number of calls are increasing.

208
00:36:36,365 --> 00:36:40,367
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just I'm proud of everybody, the way they've handled everything.

209
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,661
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, listen, that's another one too.

210
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:49,904
[SPEAKER_08]: When you first heard you're going to have a civilian interact with our police officers and you hear how nervous that could be.

211
00:36:50,504 --> 00:36:54,306
[SPEAKER_08]: And I heard it's been nothing but flawless and it's been such a positive.

212
00:36:54,646 --> 00:36:55,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Unbelievable.

213
00:36:55,907 --> 00:36:57,888
[SPEAKER_02]: In the 80s, that would have never happened.

214
00:36:57,968 --> 00:36:58,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

215
00:36:58,328 --> 00:37:10,674
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was there in the 80s and it shows how much things have changed and the clinicians have done a fabulous job in our offices and the clinicians work very, very well together.

216
00:37:11,351 --> 00:37:13,512
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's good for the city of Medford.

217
00:37:14,252 --> 00:37:16,293
[SPEAKER_08]: I commend you all on that.

218
00:37:16,333 --> 00:37:21,135
[SPEAKER_08]: And then again, I think the last piece is my most important piece is, you know, the staffing level.

219
00:37:21,375 --> 00:37:24,376
[SPEAKER_08]: And I didn't realize we're down, we're gonna be down to 90 police officers.

220
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:36,261
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I know that you put forth a plan that looks like we're gonna be up there, but how are we with our, I'm okay with that.

221
00:37:36,281 --> 00:37:37,662
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm gonna live with that and say, okay,

222
00:37:39,347 --> 00:37:45,188
[SPEAKER_08]: The famous voice of Barry Clemente has said that we're gonna be, we're still working on that.

223
00:37:45,528 --> 00:37:46,268
[SPEAKER_08]: How's our fleet?

224
00:37:46,968 --> 00:37:48,989
[SPEAKER_08]: Our cruisers, we're turning those over?

225
00:37:49,009 --> 00:37:49,829
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing all right.

226
00:37:49,909 --> 00:37:53,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them, we have some high mileage on them.

227
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:58,411
[SPEAKER_02]: We just released one into traffic east a couple of weeks ago, 337.

228
00:37:58,451 --> 00:38:02,951
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm told we're getting another vehicle next week, 338.

229
00:38:03,672 --> 00:38:05,632
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be released to traffic west.

230
00:38:06,403 --> 00:38:14,768
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like a little shot of B-12 into the fleet, into the aging fleet, but we're doing okay.

231
00:38:14,828 --> 00:38:15,488
[SPEAKER_08]: But we're doing okay.

232
00:38:15,508 --> 00:38:16,409
[SPEAKER_08]: It's nothing to be alarmed.

233
00:38:16,869 --> 00:38:27,855
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, the last piece I have is when we talked about the library when our librarian was here, but when you're talking about the fight at the police station, new police station, are we maintaining its integrity?

234
00:38:28,035 --> 00:38:30,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Lieutenant Gagliardi takes care of everything.

235
00:38:30,957 --> 00:38:32,357
[SPEAKER_02]: He has everything down to a science.

236
00:38:32,377 --> 00:38:34,378
[SPEAKER_02]: He knows every nook and cranny of the police station.

237
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:39,303
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just thrilled that we're in there, and it's a beautiful building.

238
00:38:40,304 --> 00:38:46,189
[SPEAKER_08]: So we've gone a long way where it took a tour one year of the old station, and we had three detectives change the light bulbs.

239
00:38:46,209 --> 00:38:51,713
[SPEAKER_02]: I look outside my window, I can see the old station, and it helps me to remind us where we came from.

240
00:38:51,934 --> 00:38:56,417
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't think I'd get to see it, but fortunately everything worked out, and it's beautiful.

241
00:38:58,619 --> 00:38:59,960
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I said, I commend you.

242
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,903
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that we have some contentious

243
00:39:05,415 --> 00:39:26,235
[SPEAKER_08]: issues that are happening throughout the world but especially in our country right now and so many questions of ice and I know, give chief a lot of credit, how he stands up and explains what the duty of a law enforcement officer is and what the limitations are and what they can and what they can't do and I appreciate that.

244
00:39:27,103 --> 00:39:31,007
[SPEAKER_08]: you, uh, you and the team and chief and the team stay professional and stay above it all.

245
00:39:31,027 --> 00:39:32,909
[SPEAKER_08]: So I appreciate that he does.

246
00:39:33,149 --> 00:39:49,066
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, I, I, I think that, you know, I, I, there's been times when you guys have been here and I've kind of had to call things out and, but I will tell you, I'm, I'm, I'm proud of our method police department and, uh, all the men and women that serve and,

247
00:39:49,898 --> 00:39:51,579
[SPEAKER_08]: and just keep making us proud.

248
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:54,480
[SPEAKER_08]: And like I said, I think that I'll still be advocating.

249
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:59,601
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that we'll be having resolutions coming up and looking at non-union raises.

250
00:39:59,701 --> 00:40:12,826
[SPEAKER_08]: And I, again, will stand against it until every union officer and union position in the city gets their contract caught up to date before we give anybody else their due.

251
00:40:12,886 --> 00:40:14,326
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you.

252
00:40:14,927 --> 00:40:15,727
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate you guys.

253
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:16,107
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

254
00:40:16,887 --> 00:40:17,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor.

255
00:40:17,588 --> 00:40:18,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

256
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,061
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, thank you for coming out here.

257
00:40:22,081 --> 00:40:25,021
[SPEAKER_10]: Very impressed by your presentation, very thorough.

258
00:40:25,401 --> 00:40:29,382
[SPEAKER_10]: So just appreciate that whenever I see it.

259
00:40:30,443 --> 00:40:34,284
[SPEAKER_10]: Mainly just, question was just due to the staff, was just around the staffing levels.

260
00:40:34,344 --> 00:40:37,924
[SPEAKER_10]: So the 93 versus the 107 goal.

261
00:40:37,964 --> 00:40:43,146
[SPEAKER_10]: Would you say that that's kind of more of a statewide or national issue?

262
00:40:43,666 --> 00:40:47,107
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, is that just something Medford's running into or is other?

263
00:40:48,782 --> 00:40:54,365
[SPEAKER_02]: wasn't showing my age, but I got on and sworn in in 84 and started in 85.

264
00:40:54,705 --> 00:40:55,726
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not a day above 30.

265
00:40:55,806 --> 00:40:57,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

266
00:40:57,287 --> 00:40:58,807
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't feel that good.

267
00:40:58,927 --> 00:41:00,248
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

268
00:41:00,888 --> 00:41:03,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Back then, they used to put big groups of officers on.

269
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:05,031
[SPEAKER_02]: They put on like maybe 10, 12, 15.

270
00:41:06,932 --> 00:41:08,613
[SPEAKER_02]: And they did that throughout the 80s.

271
00:41:10,414 --> 00:41:16,897
[SPEAKER_02]: And now all those officers are now hitting their 30 year mark, 32, 35, maybe even 40 years.

272
00:41:17,357 --> 00:41:18,558
[SPEAKER_02]: We've seen a lot of retirements.

273
00:41:19,781 --> 00:41:21,402
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what's kind of happening right now.

274
00:41:22,482 --> 00:41:23,822
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost like the perfect storm.

275
00:41:24,963 --> 00:41:31,265
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's been some retirements, offices that have reached their retirement age.

276
00:41:31,805 --> 00:41:33,465
[SPEAKER_02]: We lost some offices there.

277
00:41:34,426 --> 00:41:41,468
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like we're getting three in a couple of weeks, but we're losing three next year in 26.

278
00:41:42,568 --> 00:41:47,350
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to, making strides to stay with that number, 107.

279
00:41:49,483 --> 00:42:00,057
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know Captain Brooks is working on that and he told me today unequivocally was the word that he used that we're absolutely going to be able to get these offices so.

280
00:42:01,722 --> 00:42:16,009
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, no, I just, I just like to understand with these initiatives, how much like, cause you could come up with the best recruitment plan in the world, but you're still kind of fighting against, you know, a lot of outside influences, like what you just described.

281
00:42:16,069 --> 00:42:19,291
[SPEAKER_10]: So just a lot of officers coming to retirement.

282
00:42:19,331 --> 00:42:25,414
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would like, I just, I just like the model that's in place now, the way it's explained to me, it's going to help as well.

283
00:42:26,062 --> 00:42:32,624
[SPEAKER_02]: civil service approved and have people on a list of civil service and from this hybrid model as well.

284
00:42:32,724 --> 00:42:34,545
[SPEAKER_02]: So there'll be more candidates.

285
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:37,306
[SPEAKER_02]: We just don't hire to just check a box.

286
00:42:38,006 --> 00:42:39,347
[SPEAKER_02]: They go through a rigorous

287
00:42:40,143 --> 00:42:40,643
[SPEAKER_02]: process.

288
00:42:41,324 --> 00:42:44,785
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, background, we definitely look, we definitely like to hear that.

289
00:42:44,845 --> 00:42:46,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

290
00:42:47,066 --> 00:42:55,029
[SPEAKER_02]: extensive background tests, they go through psychological tests, they have to do medicals, they have to do a physical ability test interviews.

291
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:57,250
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a process.

292
00:42:57,810 --> 00:43:04,033
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we just don't hire fortunately, just to check a box to say we hired, we make sure that they're actually

293
00:43:04,994 --> 00:43:07,935
[SPEAKER_02]: good candidates, not great candidates.

294
00:43:08,055 --> 00:43:11,936
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they get a conditional offer of employment.

295
00:43:12,576 --> 00:43:14,756
[SPEAKER_02]: And we go from there, and then we set them up in an academy.

296
00:43:15,436 --> 00:43:26,339
[SPEAKER_02]: But sometimes if you have 10 people on a list, and maybe like two of them are good, two of them are real good, you'll just take those two.

297
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:29,459
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's another issue as well.

298
00:43:29,499 --> 00:43:32,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes there's not many people on that list in the past.

299
00:43:33,328 --> 00:43:39,971
[SPEAKER_02]: And civil service now, as you know, gives the test every year, as opposed to two years as it did in prior years.

300
00:43:41,231 --> 00:43:46,033
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason maybe for that is they just can't get enough people to sit for the exam.

301
00:43:46,873 --> 00:43:52,375
[SPEAKER_02]: When I took the exam back in, I took one in 83, and I remember I took it at Medford High School.

302
00:43:52,555 --> 00:43:54,396
[SPEAKER_02]: The line was from the high school

303
00:43:54,886 --> 00:44:00,628
[SPEAKER_02]: all the way down to Winthrop Street, that was the line just to get into the building to take the exam.

304
00:44:00,848 --> 00:44:02,029
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how things have changed.

305
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:09,371
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like that today for whatever reason, but we're making strides.

306
00:44:09,411 --> 00:44:10,392
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna hit that 107.

307
00:44:10,852 --> 00:44:13,413
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel pretty good about it.

308
00:44:13,513 --> 00:44:22,636
[SPEAKER_10]: If you had to sort of estimate a timeline, so it sounds like it's not necessarily gonna be solved by the next year, but do you think that this could be addressed in five years, 10 years?

309
00:44:22,676 --> 00:44:23,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a good question.

310
00:44:25,031 --> 00:44:33,037
[SPEAKER_02]: I think October, Captain Brooks told me today that there's a Plymouth Academy, and we can get eight in there.

311
00:44:33,357 --> 00:44:37,880
[SPEAKER_02]: If we can find eight great candidates, we'll have eight spots.

312
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:43,324
[SPEAKER_02]: And then again, in 2026, possible February, there'll be another six.

313
00:44:44,244 --> 00:44:48,267
[SPEAKER_02]: So I feel pretty good about that.

314
00:44:49,348 --> 00:44:50,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I feel real good about it.

315
00:44:52,339 --> 00:44:53,339
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to add something to that.

316
00:44:53,739 --> 00:45:02,481
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's essential that we stay competitive, but based on this hybrid model that we're talking about, the candidates are gonna be looking around at a lot of other communities.

317
00:45:02,721 --> 00:45:10,803
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we wanna pick up the best recruitment possible, we're gonna have to be competitive or we'll lose them.

318
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:14,024
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's probably the most vital part of this whole hiring process.

319
00:45:14,284 --> 00:45:17,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Several communities may be looking at someone on that hybrid model.

320
00:45:18,404 --> 00:45:20,665
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's an issue.

321
00:45:21,455 --> 00:45:23,716
[SPEAKER_10]: No, and these are selection processes, everything.

322
00:45:23,736 --> 00:45:32,442
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd argue that I'd rather have a lower number of very quality officers than just trying to select everybody you can to fill the 107.

323
00:45:32,642 --> 00:45:35,704
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm glad to hear that y'all are doing that.

324
00:45:35,784 --> 00:45:37,805
[SPEAKER_10]: But that was the only question I had.

325
00:45:37,845 --> 00:45:38,726
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for coming out here.

326
00:45:40,267 --> 00:45:40,707
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

327
00:45:40,727 --> 00:45:42,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have any more questions from members of the council?

328
00:45:45,144 --> 00:45:52,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Seeing that I have a few, and then we're going to quickly after I'm done go through traffic commission and traffic supervisors if that's okay it's, those will be easy.

329
00:45:53,329 --> 00:45:56,852
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, if there's members of the public who want to comment we'll take after that.

330
00:45:58,313 --> 00:45:59,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a couple of quick things.

331
00:46:02,877 --> 00:46:08,520
[SPEAKER_03]: there's potentially 17 slots between now and February, 2026 in the Academy.

332
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:12,122
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what would get us up close to that 107 number, even with a few retirements.

333
00:46:12,182 --> 00:46:14,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Just wanna get that right.

334
00:46:14,163 --> 00:46:15,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we were 93 right now.

335
00:46:15,983 --> 00:46:20,266
[SPEAKER_02]: If we count the ones that are graduating in about a week and a half from Cambridge, that'll bring us to 93.

336
00:46:20,646 --> 00:46:24,868
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna lose three definite hits next year.

337
00:46:25,408 --> 00:46:28,410
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's three we got to kind of put out there and just think of that.

338
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:30,170
[SPEAKER_02]: If we put 14 on,

339
00:46:31,783 --> 00:46:37,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're fortunate enough to get the fine 14 throughout this hiring process.

340
00:46:37,428 --> 00:46:43,633
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, in February, that's yeah, that's 1493 and 14, that'd be 107.

341
00:46:43,673 --> 00:46:44,794
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're going to be down again.

342
00:46:44,834 --> 00:46:45,815
[SPEAKER_02]: So 104.

343
00:46:46,215 --> 00:46:49,618
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, it's kind of like a moving target, kind of.

344
00:46:50,807 --> 00:46:52,988
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be back on the under that again.

345
00:46:53,008 --> 00:46:54,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, before you know it.

346
00:46:55,088 --> 00:46:55,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, okay.

347
00:46:57,409 --> 00:47:12,333
[SPEAKER_03]: And it sounds like one of the problems was that lists were short, and then if people weren't passing everything, right, then they weren't eligible and then this hybrid model has created bigger lists, but it also means that other communities are we've seen people, unfortunately, they cannot do the run.

348
00:47:13,557 --> 00:47:29,746
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've seen, I've seen people that you look at them and they're like in great shape and they just, I don't know if they just don't practice, but I've seen them several times fail and that has stopped a lot of probably good candidates from moving further, but it's all part of the process.

349
00:47:29,806 --> 00:47:31,046
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not an easy process.

350
00:47:31,587 --> 00:47:38,250
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure I'd want to go through it right now myself, but it's, you know, it's interesting.

351
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:39,191
[SPEAKER_02]: It's quite the process.

352
00:47:39,751 --> 00:47:39,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

353
00:47:40,671 --> 00:47:41,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for that.

354
00:47:42,082 --> 00:47:47,703
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple other things on the mental health grant, is that every year it comes up or does it's every year?

355
00:47:48,064 --> 00:47:48,864
[SPEAKER_03]: That's an annual.

356
00:47:49,104 --> 00:47:50,704
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a state grant, right?

357
00:47:50,884 --> 00:47:51,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

358
00:47:51,224 --> 00:47:52,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Department of Mental Health.

359
00:47:52,645 --> 00:47:52,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

360
00:47:52,905 --> 00:47:53,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

361
00:47:53,145 --> 00:47:54,345
[SPEAKER_02]: We're hoping the funding's there.

362
00:47:54,365 --> 00:48:00,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Because like I say, this program, this co-response program has been fantastic.

363
00:48:01,347 --> 00:48:01,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

364
00:48:01,808 --> 00:48:10,955
[SPEAKER_03]: And so in the long term, we might want to look at, given the situation, if the state is in a funding crunch, we might want to bring that in house so that we can keep it going if the grant dries up.

365
00:48:10,975 --> 00:48:12,576
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just think that's a huge, huge program.

366
00:48:12,856 --> 00:48:14,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, important for us to keep in mind.

367
00:48:16,170 --> 00:48:21,953
[SPEAKER_03]: The legal costs item that new 25,000, it just says new 25,000 for legal costs.

368
00:48:21,993 --> 00:48:23,813
[SPEAKER_03]: Could you go into a little bit more what that might go?

369
00:48:23,833 --> 00:48:29,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's, that's actually just a reallocation, which is trying to, if you look at last year's accreditation was 40,000.

370
00:48:30,176 --> 00:48:30,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

371
00:48:31,536 --> 00:48:33,997
[SPEAKER_04]: And the only thing we did, we just tried to break it up.

372
00:48:34,737 --> 00:48:38,459
[SPEAKER_04]: The 16, the 16,000 is gonna be for assessment centers for sergeants.

373
00:48:38,739 --> 00:48:38,919
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

374
00:48:39,019 --> 00:48:42,760
[SPEAKER_04]: So we kind of wanted to break assessment centers away from the professional services admin portion.

375
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:44,681
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically, we were level funded there.

376
00:48:45,081 --> 00:48:46,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thanks.

377
00:48:48,764 --> 00:48:52,466
[SPEAKER_03]: But I go one that's maybe a little harder and then I think one that tells a really good story.

378
00:48:52,626 --> 00:48:59,551
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, take it even with what's going on right now, certainly ice but other federal agencies.

379
00:48:59,571 --> 00:49:12,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Could you talk a little bit about how it seems to me, and this is an opinion, but I think it's shared by a lot of people in the city.

380
00:49:13,230 --> 00:49:18,873
[SPEAKER_03]: that there's some element of intimidation coming in from some agencies that are coming into the city.

381
00:49:19,633 --> 00:49:22,375
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not wearing, they're not identifying themselves.

382
00:49:22,815 --> 00:49:23,975
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes they're wearing masks.

383
00:49:25,276 --> 00:49:32,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes they're, you know, we've seen in other neighboring communities, smashing a car window to get into a car, things like that.

384
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:42,025
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you guys working through being able to know when they're coming here, you know, and you have to partner with them on some things.

385
00:49:43,365 --> 00:49:49,589
[SPEAKER_03]: a big criminal racket and something going on in the city, we'd want local police and the FBI to be working together, right?

386
00:49:50,249 --> 00:49:56,973
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's other times where it seems now that federal law enforcement is being used as an instrument of intimidation.

387
00:49:57,494 --> 00:50:09,461
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm wondering how you guys are working through that to understand when it makes sense to work together and when you might say, ask more questions and say, well, what's going on here and why are we doing this?

388
00:50:10,088 --> 00:50:15,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, I know what they they have shown up at the courts, we don't know that they're showing up there.

389
00:50:17,132 --> 00:50:24,036
[SPEAKER_02]: The case will happen, you know, our officers will go in testifying in court, but they don't know that they're there.

390
00:50:24,156 --> 00:50:25,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently they're outside.

391
00:50:25,277 --> 00:50:26,077
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

392
00:50:26,157 --> 00:50:27,618
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how they get there.

393
00:50:27,658 --> 00:50:31,000
[SPEAKER_02]: How they, you know, just I don't know.

394
00:50:31,561 --> 00:50:31,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

395
00:50:33,101 --> 00:50:33,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I guess I mean, like,

396
00:50:34,469 --> 00:50:38,872
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we had an incident over in Haines Square, two or three weeks ago.

397
00:50:39,532 --> 00:50:43,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Residents said, there's these people in my community, they're wearing masks.

398
00:50:43,375 --> 00:50:44,175
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know who they are.

399
00:50:44,195 --> 00:50:45,416
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't feel safe.

400
00:50:46,016 --> 00:50:46,537
[SPEAKER_03]: What do we do?

401
00:50:46,557 --> 00:50:55,182
[SPEAKER_03]: How are we trying to engage with that situation, understanding there are limits on what you guys can do, but also understanding that the community, we're here to keep people safe.

402
00:50:55,282 --> 00:50:57,904
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if we received any calls on that.

403
00:50:58,204 --> 00:51:01,146
[SPEAKER_02]: I would think that, you know, I don't know if they're properly marked or...

404
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:03,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that I don't know.

405
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:07,211
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I would think that there should be some proper identification.

406
00:51:07,711 --> 00:51:08,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

407
00:51:09,352 --> 00:51:10,032
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

408
00:51:10,072 --> 00:51:12,213
[SPEAKER_03]: I received two or three calls myself about it.

409
00:51:12,393 --> 00:51:12,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Captain Camino.

410
00:51:13,013 --> 00:51:13,873
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

411
00:51:13,993 --> 00:51:19,095
[SPEAKER_18]: I always see the operations division, which is patrol detectives in traffic.

412
00:51:19,455 --> 00:51:20,215
[SPEAKER_18]: We do have them.

413
00:51:20,355 --> 00:51:21,575
[SPEAKER_18]: They usually come in and check in.

414
00:51:21,916 --> 00:51:25,837
[SPEAKER_18]: It's early in the morning and say, okay, we're going to be in the city in a certain area.

415
00:51:25,857 --> 00:51:26,777
[SPEAKER_18]: And they'll tell us what area.

416
00:51:27,298 --> 00:51:29,819
[SPEAKER_18]: they always are identified by badges.

417
00:51:30,479 --> 00:51:34,581
[SPEAKER_18]: Even if you see them on the news and you hear people saying they're not identifying themselves, they have a badge.

418
00:51:35,122 --> 00:51:38,423
[SPEAKER_18]: By law, that's about all you have to display at that point in time.

419
00:51:39,364 --> 00:51:50,809
[SPEAKER_18]: Everyone I've seen has a vest on that's marked and usually says some sort of agency on the back, whether it's ICE, FBI, ATF, some just say police on them, but they all carry a badge.

420
00:51:52,409 --> 00:51:53,950
[SPEAKER_18]: So they're identified in that sense.

421
00:51:56,661 --> 00:51:58,522
[SPEAKER_18]: Things were smashing the window.

422
00:52:01,264 --> 00:52:03,505
[SPEAKER_18]: What's going down is an officer, they're making an arrest.

423
00:52:05,347 --> 00:52:10,090
[SPEAKER_18]: An argument, we're not going to dispute, but it's a lawful arrest based on what information they have.

424
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:15,433
[SPEAKER_18]: And whether it's a warrant or a detainer, they have the lawful right to arrest that person.

425
00:52:15,953 --> 00:52:20,336
[SPEAKER_18]: When the person refused to get out of the car, that's when the window got broken.

426
00:52:20,356 --> 00:52:26,500
[SPEAKER_18]: And I understand, in that particular case you're talking about, it was several minutes, maybe even up to 30 minutes before they

427
00:52:27,808 --> 00:52:31,853
[SPEAKER_18]: By law, we aren't allowed to use force to arrest someone.

428
00:52:31,934 --> 00:52:35,118
[SPEAKER_18]: Once I say you're under arrest, you're under arrest, there's no changing that, right?

429
00:52:35,298 --> 00:52:39,364
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't want to have to chase you, put my hands on you, do anything other than put the handcuffs on and take you.

430
00:52:39,944 --> 00:52:42,768
[SPEAKER_18]: So this is what is being portrayed on the news.

431
00:52:44,762 --> 00:52:51,045
[SPEAKER_18]: Arrest warrant does not have to be displayed and arrest warrant is just you're under arrest and you come with me.

432
00:52:51,326 --> 00:52:57,949
[SPEAKER_18]: This is due process is bringing you through the system into courts where if I'm wrong and I make a mistake and I arrest you.

433
00:52:58,356 --> 00:53:00,538
[SPEAKER_18]: and put you in court and detain you.

434
00:53:00,718 --> 00:53:09,106
[SPEAKER_18]: And each step of the way that I keep you, each step, that violation of a civil matter gets bigger and bigger.

435
00:53:09,166 --> 00:53:11,809
[SPEAKER_18]: So... Sorry, could you step a little closer to the microphone?

436
00:53:11,849 --> 00:53:12,189
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

437
00:53:12,209 --> 00:53:21,638
[SPEAKER_18]: So each step away, each step into the process that I hold someone illegally, each time, basically the price that they're gonna get on a lawsuit gets higher and higher.

438
00:53:21,998 --> 00:53:23,139
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're very careful about

439
00:53:24,049 --> 00:53:25,991
[SPEAKER_18]: making arrest so are the federal agents.

440
00:53:26,091 --> 00:53:26,372
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure.

441
00:53:26,492 --> 00:53:33,420
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, so they are lawfully here, they are lawfully arresting people, they're not just kidnapping people.

442
00:53:34,621 --> 00:53:36,563
[SPEAKER_18]: They do come in check with us.

443
00:53:37,044 --> 00:53:39,266
[SPEAKER_18]: Now we do not enforce their laws.

444
00:53:39,607 --> 00:53:41,929
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, they enforce them we enforce state laws.

445
00:53:42,490 --> 00:53:54,200
[SPEAKER_18]: The we will get in the middle, if somebody tries to interfere with them and assault them or disrupt that in any way we will have to, just like any other citizen anybody else in the community, we have to protect everybody.

446
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:56,662
[SPEAKER_18]: And if they're doing their job in a lawful way.

447
00:53:57,996 --> 00:54:13,912
[SPEAKER_18]: and people attack them or something we're gonna have to intervene and keep the peace, and hopefully not have to arrest somebody know our goals and not to arrest people, but we do have to get in the middle, and would be the same as if any other type of employee was trying to do their job if you're out there.

448
00:54:14,803 --> 00:54:20,565
[SPEAKER_18]: campaigning and somebody doesn't like what you're campaigning about and they're going to, we're going to, we're going to protect you.

449
00:54:20,745 --> 00:54:26,648
[SPEAKER_18]: So, in that sense, they're on their own as far as enforcing federal laws and federal practices.

450
00:54:27,208 --> 00:54:37,352
[SPEAKER_18]: We're just on the periphery in case somebody attacks them or assaults them in some way, and let's hope that we don't get to that point let's hope that people in our city.

451
00:54:38,272 --> 00:54:46,762
[SPEAKER_18]: smart enough to say, let them do their job and do process will play out do it do process is done through the whole system it's not just, you know what happens in the street.

452
00:54:47,303 --> 00:54:54,431
[SPEAKER_18]: So, as far as our job goes, our job is to enforce the laws of the Commonwealth in the ordinance of the city.

453
00:54:56,273 --> 00:55:03,615
[SPEAKER_18]: and uphold the Constitution, obviously, but the Constitution of the United States, as well as the state of Massachusetts.

454
00:55:03,635 --> 00:55:05,595
[SPEAKER_18]: But we are stuck in the middle.

455
00:55:06,395 --> 00:55:21,379
[SPEAKER_18]: And politically, if you notice, in years past, going before 2020, whenever protests came up and stuff, our job, and I've always been very clear with that, and the chief has too, is to intervene only to keep the peace.

456
00:55:22,039 --> 00:55:22,780
[SPEAKER_18]: keep people safe.

457
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:27,844
[SPEAKER_18]: We're not taking a political stance, we do not take a political stance, we never have, we never will.

458
00:55:28,905 --> 00:55:33,269
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't like getting put in the middle too, there are people that say we're here protesting for you.

459
00:55:33,910 --> 00:55:39,095
[SPEAKER_18]: I appreciate that, but my job is very specific in what we're supposed to do.

460
00:55:39,155 --> 00:55:41,377
[SPEAKER_18]: We are here to keep everybody safe, keep the peace.

461
00:55:42,058 --> 00:55:44,079
[SPEAKER_18]: And we're not here to be

462
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:56,787
[SPEAKER_18]: politicized and get in the middle of different opinions and, and I understand where you are coming from your viewpoint is is contained to what you just saw on the news, and what somebody close by gave an opinion of.

463
00:55:57,448 --> 00:56:00,570
[SPEAKER_18]: And so you're limited to some of the facts there.

464
00:56:01,310 --> 00:56:17,145
[SPEAKER_18]: I see those facts too but I see them differently because I understand how police work is done, and how things get escalated, no matter how much you try to de escalate or keep it down to a point so just to answer your question, in a sense, exactly as our, our job is to keep everybody safe.

465
00:56:17,925 --> 00:56:19,307
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't enforce federal laws.

466
00:56:19,847 --> 00:56:24,652
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't arrest people on federal laws, right, the only time we might arrest someone is if there's a federal warrant.

467
00:56:25,624 --> 00:56:28,666
[SPEAKER_18]: In that case, we would probably arrest them as a fugitive from justice.

468
00:56:28,846 --> 00:56:33,069
[SPEAKER_18]: Bring them to our court where they'd be charged as a fugitive from justice, and then they would get into that system.

469
00:56:33,489 --> 00:56:34,710
[SPEAKER_18]: Detainers, we don't arrest.

470
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:35,691
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't hold people on.

471
00:56:36,151 --> 00:56:39,113
[SPEAKER_18]: We do notify people if we're told there's a detainer.

472
00:56:40,454 --> 00:56:41,874
[SPEAKER_18]: We tell them there's a detainer for you.

473
00:56:42,235 --> 00:56:43,716
[SPEAKER_18]: But they still go through our process.

474
00:56:43,756 --> 00:56:44,116
[SPEAKER_03]: You tell them.

475
00:56:44,156 --> 00:56:46,297
[SPEAKER_03]: If someone comes in, you say, hey, this is in our system.

476
00:56:46,357 --> 00:56:46,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

477
00:56:46,618 --> 00:56:47,638
[SPEAKER_18]: So we arrest somebody.

478
00:56:47,778 --> 00:56:50,320
[SPEAKER_18]: We have to fingerprint everybody we arrest now by state law.

479
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:54,943
[SPEAKER_18]: It's called a digital identification, a biomedical identification, what we call it.

480
00:56:56,524 --> 00:57:02,087
[SPEAKER_18]: And so when that happens, that those electronic fingerprints go through the state system and then to the federal.

481
00:57:02,647 --> 00:57:05,128
[SPEAKER_18]: Obviously the feds get notified somehow.

482
00:57:05,248 --> 00:57:08,550
[SPEAKER_18]: So they'll send us a detainer and say, we have a detainer for that person.

483
00:57:08,930 --> 00:57:09,971
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll hand it to that person.

484
00:57:09,991 --> 00:57:10,791
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll put it with their property.

485
00:57:10,811 --> 00:57:12,272
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll tell them there's a detainer for you.

486
00:57:12,753 --> 00:57:18,516
[SPEAKER_18]: So they'll either get bailed out as per normal process, or they'll go to Somerville District Court the next morning.

487
00:57:18,936 --> 00:57:22,558
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's usually there where the federal agents will go looking for them.

488
00:57:24,055 --> 00:57:31,640
[SPEAKER_18]: One other thing, I know there was some controversy in another city where other agents were out there, and the police were assisting them.

489
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:43,307
[SPEAKER_18]: And it was because those particular agents were going after someone for human trafficking, who happened to also have some sort of ICE immigration violations, but there were FBI agents, and they were going after them for human trafficking.

490
00:57:43,327 --> 00:57:45,889
[SPEAKER_18]: So there's a confusion there when people see that in the news.

491
00:57:45,909 --> 00:57:46,129
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

492
00:57:46,429 --> 00:57:52,313
[SPEAKER_02]: The ones I have seen, they are, like I think Avino said, they do have identification on them.

493
00:57:53,073 --> 00:57:59,057
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why I was kind of- And it might be the unmarked vehicle maybe is what I'm trying to- It's the whole perception of the unmarked vehicle.

494
00:57:59,077 --> 00:58:04,280
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe they should start having at least one marked vehicle with them and one or two officers in uniform.

495
00:58:04,341 --> 00:58:21,312
[SPEAKER_03]: They do have some sort of, I know ICE has some sort of uniform division, so maybe that's what they should, but that's- And we've seen a few, I've seen a lot of photos with the vest and the police, ICE or police, FBI or whatever, but I've also seen some with maybe just the badge, nothing on the back.

496
00:58:21,852 --> 00:58:23,093
[SPEAKER_03]: unmarked vehicle, the mask.

497
00:58:23,173 --> 00:58:24,854
[SPEAKER_18]: And our detectors would be the same thing.

498
00:58:24,934 --> 00:58:31,098
[SPEAKER_18]: If our detectors are out there in plain clothes, their badge would either be hanging or clipped to their belt.

499
00:58:31,238 --> 00:58:33,099
[SPEAKER_18]: We do carry our identification with us.

500
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:37,582
[SPEAKER_18]: By state law, we have to carry our identification with us, our police identification.

501
00:58:37,722 --> 00:58:37,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

502
00:58:38,123 --> 00:58:41,545
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really appreciate the answer and giving the details of how it works.

503
00:58:41,565 --> 00:58:46,068
[SPEAKER_03]: And I understand it's difficult to be in the middle of stuff like this.

504
00:58:46,128 --> 00:58:47,088
[SPEAKER_03]: So I appreciate it.

505
00:58:48,228 --> 00:58:52,570
[SPEAKER_03]: And mostly I'm, it seems like all of this might make things even harder to discern.

506
00:58:52,990 --> 00:58:59,233
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, what's in the middle is we've always had some immigrant population in the city and we have always worked with them.

507
00:58:59,533 --> 00:59:11,538
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, and there's always a certain amount of distrust because many of them come from countries where they don't trust the police to right now we're, we're facing not only their, their distress from their past countries they live them.

508
00:59:11,858 --> 00:59:14,961
[SPEAKER_18]: but now they're afraid of being deported.

509
00:59:15,201 --> 00:59:20,265
[SPEAKER_18]: And some of them likely wouldn't even be deported or wouldn't be on that list, but they're still afraid.

510
00:59:20,745 --> 00:59:24,068
[SPEAKER_18]: So they think we're part of that as soon as they see law enforcement, they're afraid of us.

511
00:59:24,589 --> 00:59:29,452
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're doing the best we can to try and reach out and see that everybody gets the help they need out there.

512
00:59:31,214 --> 00:59:35,217
[SPEAKER_18]: But it's just not an easy process.

513
00:59:35,617 --> 00:59:36,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.

514
00:59:36,198 --> 00:59:38,540
[SPEAKER_03]: No, and I appreciate you really going through the details on that.

515
00:59:39,961 --> 00:59:40,401
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the

516
00:59:41,665 --> 00:59:57,298
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing for me is that safety element right whether it's immigrants who don't feel safe for people in general, in the community who see something and think is this safe is this not safe is this legitimate is this, you know, many of these immigrants are being misinformed and how the legal process works.

517
00:59:57,458 --> 00:59:57,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

518
00:59:58,679 --> 01:00:01,722
[SPEAKER_18]: We've had one gentleman that was arrested for OUI drunk driving.

519
01:00:02,362 --> 01:00:09,587
[SPEAKER_18]: And he wouldn't go for the identification booking process, and he continued to claim the his fifth amendment right.

520
01:00:10,087 --> 01:00:18,752
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, the Fifth Amendment doesn't apply to the identification process and bookings sure and trying to explain that to him was difficult, and he didn't want to hear it.

521
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:21,674
[SPEAKER_18]: So he's been when when people are misinformed on the outside.

522
01:00:22,614 --> 01:00:23,435
[SPEAKER_18]: It makes it difficult.

523
01:00:24,312 --> 01:00:28,638
[SPEAKER_18]: for everybody to do the job and to get, he would have been processed much sooner, sent to court.

524
01:00:28,658 --> 01:00:35,447
[SPEAKER_18]: Instead, he had to wait because until he cooperated and then finished the booking process and then get him over to court.

525
01:00:36,168 --> 01:00:38,491
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's another dilemma that we run into.

526
01:00:40,967 --> 01:00:44,308
[SPEAKER_18]: We're here to help people, we're here to keep them safe and make them feel safe.

527
01:00:44,748 --> 01:00:53,411
[SPEAKER_18]: And unfortunately, we can't always be in that right position when they feel that way, because we're all sometimes we have to be the bad, we look like the bad person anyway.

528
01:00:53,991 --> 01:01:02,654
[SPEAKER_18]: And when you have to use force to apprehend someone, even though you're in a lawful position to use a certain amount of force to whatever is necessary to

529
01:01:04,475 --> 01:01:08,438
[SPEAKER_18]: bring that person to in possession, so to speak, handcuff them.

530
01:01:08,959 --> 01:01:10,501
[SPEAKER_18]: Force is ugly no matter how it's used.

531
01:01:11,061 --> 01:01:13,263
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's why we don't like using it if we don't have to.

532
01:01:13,624 --> 01:01:20,851
[SPEAKER_18]: But it is ugly when it's used, even if you're lawfully using the amount of force that's necessary to subdue someone.

533
01:01:22,615 --> 01:01:27,498
[SPEAKER_18]: But we're always here willing to answer any questions for all of you and anyone in the city that has questions.

534
01:01:28,479 --> 01:01:28,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

535
01:01:28,839 --> 01:01:29,620
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate that.

536
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:35,463
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that that's the ultimate question I'm trying to get at is how do we get people the best information we can get them?

537
01:01:35,483 --> 01:01:38,365
[SPEAKER_18]: That would be, you know, we all need to be on the same page with that.

538
01:01:38,505 --> 01:01:38,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

539
01:01:39,106 --> 01:01:43,529
[SPEAKER_18]: And, you know, there are organizations out there that want to spew out people's rights, which is great.

540
01:01:43,669 --> 01:01:51,714
[SPEAKER_18]: But let's get the right information out to people, because I think some of the people that are repeating that information do not know what they're talking about.

541
01:01:52,523 --> 01:01:56,411
[SPEAKER_18]: They know a little bit as a good friend of mine once said, a little bit of knowledge is dangerous.

542
01:01:57,153 --> 01:02:02,665
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think any organization out there that is on the legal end of it.

543
01:02:04,653 --> 01:02:13,199
[SPEAKER_18]: they would know exactly what the person's rights are and how to, in most cases, you know, we always tell people, just cooperate, cooperate with the police.

544
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:16,622
[SPEAKER_18]: And we're not looking to arrest you for nothing.

545
01:02:17,282 --> 01:02:18,623
[SPEAKER_18]: We have a reason to arrest you.

546
01:02:19,164 --> 01:02:25,448
[SPEAKER_18]: If our information is wrong, it'll be brought out in the process and you'll either be released or go through court and be released.

547
01:02:25,489 --> 01:02:33,615
[SPEAKER_18]: But, you know, we've had people we've arrested on a warrant, let's say, and let's say the warrant says Paul Covino,

548
01:02:34,375 --> 01:02:49,162
[SPEAKER_18]: and this person's using my name for some reason, and they get arrested, and next thing you know, that warrant exists because he never goes back to court, then there's arrest warrant for me, I get arrested, and my claim is I've never done that, I don't know.

549
01:02:49,463 --> 01:02:51,664
[SPEAKER_18]: So it has to, those things happen.

550
01:02:52,624 --> 01:02:57,687
[SPEAKER_18]: And as I said before, the big thing is we identify the problem and fix it.

551
01:02:58,527 --> 01:03:02,971
[SPEAKER_18]: And between our own systems and the court systems, we're usually pretty good about that.

552
01:03:03,031 --> 01:03:05,093
[SPEAKER_18]: But it is a process.

553
01:03:05,353 --> 01:03:10,698
[SPEAKER_18]: So if you have someone that's using your identification, that could really screw your life up for a while, too.

554
01:03:10,838 --> 01:03:12,800
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there's a couple of Paul Caminos in the city, too.

555
01:03:15,522 --> 01:03:17,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Luckily, they seem to know each other.

556
01:03:17,544 --> 01:03:19,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Fortunately, the other one is a good guy.

557
01:03:20,867 --> 01:03:21,848
[SPEAKER_03]: I know him pretty well, too.

558
01:03:22,429 --> 01:03:22,849
[SPEAKER_03]: As well as you.

559
01:03:24,998 --> 01:03:33,844
[SPEAKER_03]: My last thing and I think you know it's just something I, I, I know and I think it's just important to talk about and I think Captain Clemente you kind of even we're getting at it a little bit.

560
01:03:35,205 --> 01:03:43,690
[SPEAKER_03]: We live in a time when crime is way down, you know, over the past 30 years since the 80s over the last 30 years you know crime has really gone down.

561
01:03:45,653 --> 01:03:50,695
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think somewhat because of the way that the news works these days and social media and all this.

562
01:03:50,715 --> 01:04:05,180
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people think crime is going up when it's going down and I just wanted to wonder if you guys could talk a little bit about what we've seen in the city over the last 20 30 years around safety and how safe we are I can give you an answer partial answer that number one is

563
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:14,028
[SPEAKER_18]: back in the 80s when we came on through the 90s, you still had several younger groups, not all juveniles, but younger groups hanging around the city.

564
01:04:14,728 --> 01:04:24,498
[SPEAKER_18]: And it was not unusual for us to have to go to a park, a corner where a corner store was, where a large group of youth, people, like young people in their 20s would be hanging around.

565
01:04:25,193 --> 01:04:29,474
[SPEAKER_18]: and who's drinking on the corner, who's selling drugs from that corner.

566
01:04:30,234 --> 01:04:32,595
[SPEAKER_18]: The drug dealing operation is very different nowadays.

567
01:04:32,615 --> 01:04:36,376
[SPEAKER_18]: It used to be a certain house, a certain corner, a certain location, they would move.

568
01:04:37,076 --> 01:04:38,777
[SPEAKER_18]: That type of drug dealing is different.

569
01:04:38,817 --> 01:04:44,659
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's not located on the street as much other than it travels, they bring it to you, they'll meet you somewhere.

570
01:04:44,699 --> 01:04:48,980
[SPEAKER_18]: Now these people would hang on the corners and eventually some of them would become a problem.

571
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:51,581
[SPEAKER_18]: problem mostly to the neighborhood there.

572
01:04:51,681 --> 01:04:53,102
[SPEAKER_18]: That's where our complaints would be coming.

573
01:04:53,442 --> 01:04:59,405
[SPEAKER_18]: We would have to arrest many more disorderly conduct arrests, more fighting, more drinking in public.

574
01:04:59,445 --> 01:05:01,026
[SPEAKER_18]: Those types of arrests have gone down.

575
01:05:01,787 --> 01:05:07,690
[SPEAKER_18]: And because of what was going on with the large groups of people still hanging around the city, the fights became violent.

576
01:05:07,730 --> 01:05:11,132
[SPEAKER_18]: Sometimes there were more assaults and serious assaults and stabbings and things like that.

577
01:05:12,312 --> 01:05:16,335
[SPEAKER_18]: On the other side of the coin, because there's less people out there, there's less

578
01:05:17,477 --> 01:05:21,081
[SPEAKER_18]: street crime type arrests like that, but other types of crimes are going up.

579
01:05:21,542 --> 01:05:30,431
[SPEAKER_18]: And the biggest, one of the bigger problems right now that we have is young kids, juveniles, 14, 15, 16, 17 years old, carrying guns.

580
01:05:30,912 --> 01:05:32,213
[SPEAKER_18]: And they have guns better than us.

581
01:05:32,554 --> 01:05:33,735
[SPEAKER_18]: They have more bullets than us.

582
01:05:34,155 --> 01:05:36,978
[SPEAKER_18]: And over the years, we used to see all, if someone had a gun, it was like a little,

583
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:40,361
[SPEAKER_18]: they call a Saturday night special piece of junk falling apart.

584
01:05:40,781 --> 01:05:46,644
[SPEAKER_18]: And then when they did finally start getting their hands on good guns did have a handful of bullets and they didn't match like they were mixing.

585
01:05:46,944 --> 01:05:50,066
[SPEAKER_18]: Now they got everything and they're carrying 30 round clips that go in a gun.

586
01:05:50,687 --> 01:06:01,293
[SPEAKER_18]: And, you know, most of these kids don't know what they're doing they don't want to do it but they're doing it because they're part of a group and, you know, we've had an incident up on the hillside, not long ago in January, I believe it was, where

587
01:06:01,893 --> 01:06:04,656
[SPEAKER_18]: A couple of kids pulled guns out at one or two in the morning.

588
01:06:05,096 --> 01:06:09,961
[SPEAKER_18]: A lot of kids out, college kids there from getting pizza after having a party.

589
01:06:10,001 --> 01:06:12,383
[SPEAKER_18]: And next thing you know, multiple shots fired.

590
01:06:12,683 --> 01:06:13,844
[SPEAKER_18]: Fortunately, they didn't hit anybody.

591
01:06:14,365 --> 01:06:17,047
[SPEAKER_18]: But those are the types of crimes.

592
01:06:17,828 --> 01:06:20,070
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's what puts officers more on edge.

593
01:06:20,571 --> 01:06:24,314
[SPEAKER_18]: Because day in and day out, we're out trying to help people.

594
01:06:24,855 --> 01:06:25,896
[SPEAKER_18]: But while we're trying to help people,

595
01:06:27,448 --> 01:06:30,549
[SPEAKER_18]: dealing with their own problems so it's dealing with their problems, so to speak.

596
01:06:30,949 --> 01:06:41,053
[SPEAKER_18]: And then, you know, crimes come up and you get juveniles with guns because there are people giving them guns and directing them what to do because when the juvenile gets caught, he's not going to go to jail.

597
01:06:41,894 --> 01:06:45,675
[SPEAKER_18]: The adult that's telling them to do it will go to jail so now we're on a problem with

598
01:06:46,055 --> 01:06:55,937
[SPEAKER_18]: You get juveniles who have guns, you have juveniles who don't know better, and you have juveniles that they don't understand death, they don't understand it's final, they don't really get it.

599
01:06:56,437 --> 01:07:09,260
[SPEAKER_18]: So, it puts an officer on edge when they're out there, and they get a call in the middle of the night that there's five people out and you don't know if they're juveniles, when you get these calls, there's five people dressed in dark clothing wearing masks, looking into cars, and

600
01:07:10,882 --> 01:07:11,842
[SPEAKER_18]: and trying to open doors.

601
01:07:12,163 --> 01:07:20,071
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, I shouldn't have to explain that, but that's people that go out on a nightly basis and they try to open car doors, break in, steal things out of your cars.

602
01:07:20,491 --> 01:07:22,433
[SPEAKER_18]: If your key's in there, they're going to take your car too.

603
01:07:22,853 --> 01:07:23,934
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's what we're up against.

604
01:07:23,954 --> 01:07:28,299
[SPEAKER_18]: So now we also know that many of these people in those groups are carrying guns.

605
01:07:28,679 --> 01:07:31,942
[SPEAKER_18]: So it puts the officers on edge when they're out there and they're confronting people.

606
01:07:33,260 --> 01:07:39,604
[SPEAKER_18]: When you say crime is down, yes, the numbers might be down, but a certain amount of violence is right there.

607
01:07:40,164 --> 01:07:45,947
[SPEAKER_18]: And we've never saw that much like we see in the city now as far as juveniles with guns.

608
01:07:46,007 --> 01:07:50,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, for sure.

609
01:07:50,530 --> 01:07:55,492
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the proliferation of guns in this society is certainly worrying.

610
01:07:55,532 --> 01:08:01,095
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that you guys probably see that more directly than a lot of other people because you're interacting with them.

611
01:08:01,115 --> 01:08:02,116
[SPEAKER_03]: But more I was trying to,

612
01:08:02,693 --> 01:08:09,979
[SPEAKER_03]: to get to the point to remind people right and we're at the lowest homicides in this region and decades we're at the lowest.

613
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:12,361
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people feel unsafe.

614
01:08:12,802 --> 01:08:22,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and I'm not saying that there's no no violence and that there's no crime right now, but in general violent crime especially is significantly down compared to I'm going to say something.

615
01:08:23,508 --> 01:08:24,689
[SPEAKER_18]: We live in a very safe city.

616
01:08:25,130 --> 01:08:25,310
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

617
01:08:25,450 --> 01:08:27,352
[SPEAKER_18]: And I said that once to someone before.

618
01:08:28,613 --> 01:08:30,374
[SPEAKER_18]: It didn't work out so well, but we do.

619
01:08:30,775 --> 01:08:37,001
[SPEAKER_18]: And as you said, like you look at like the problem with violence is every time you turn the television on or you look at your phone.

620
01:08:37,241 --> 01:08:37,601
[SPEAKER_18]: Exactly.

621
01:08:37,701 --> 01:08:38,142
[SPEAKER_18]: It's there.

622
01:08:39,023 --> 01:08:41,124
[SPEAKER_18]: And the numbers may be down, but it's being put out

623
01:08:41,805 --> 01:08:52,029
[SPEAKER_18]: all the time by the news, and and they're out there they grab and every time there's a violent crime or somebody gets shot, it's it's it's at your fingertips, even if it's not even this part of the world.

624
01:08:52,469 --> 01:08:57,891
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, that's another problem so it just reinforces that negative feeling the community policing

625
01:08:59,050 --> 01:09:09,179
[SPEAKER_18]: One of the philosophy of community policing is to try and make people feel safer by letting them participate and work with the police and setting up programs and so forth.

626
01:09:09,540 --> 01:09:11,381
[SPEAKER_18]: But the idea is to feel safer.

627
01:09:11,401 --> 01:09:16,967
[SPEAKER_18]: You don't necessarily reduce crime, but you make people feel safer about their environment and being involved.

628
01:09:17,227 --> 01:09:21,571
[SPEAKER_18]: And they become more open to the police to work with us as far as fighting violence.

629
01:09:21,711 --> 01:09:21,931
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure.

630
01:09:23,552 --> 01:09:32,176
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, back when we had 136 offices, we had people everywhere we're falling over each other but you could be involved more directly with the community.

631
01:09:32,696 --> 01:09:42,000
[SPEAKER_18]: And we talked about hiring, and I don't mean to contradict anything but I believe the hiring process is here to stay the recruiting process things that we never had to do.

632
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:45,221
[SPEAKER_18]: We need professional recruitment is one of the things here.

633
01:09:45,722 --> 01:09:47,984
[SPEAKER_18]: for, if not forever for a very long time.

634
01:09:48,504 --> 01:09:59,273
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's as we lose people, we hire people we lose people, and it's becoming an open market now because we had one officer just a few officers leave but one went to Cambridge.

635
01:09:59,973 --> 01:10:01,795
[SPEAKER_18]: He's great there, right, it's a big department.

636
01:10:02,135 --> 01:10:03,135
[SPEAKER_18]: State police, a lot of difference.

637
01:10:03,156 --> 01:10:03,656
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of money.

638
01:10:03,676 --> 01:10:08,898
[SPEAKER_18]: State police, but now you don't have to take, you don't have to take an exam to get there now.

639
01:10:09,198 --> 01:10:10,959
[SPEAKER_18]: You can just, they have an opening.

640
01:10:11,019 --> 01:10:12,780
[SPEAKER_18]: They're looking for lateral offices.

641
01:10:12,860 --> 01:10:15,681
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not a lateral that a chief has to signed off on.

642
01:10:16,001 --> 01:10:18,803
[SPEAKER_18]: So as much as we can hire these people, we have to retain them.

643
01:10:19,063 --> 01:10:19,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

644
01:10:19,503 --> 01:10:21,104
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's a whole different discussion.

645
01:10:21,124 --> 01:10:25,126
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think you would find, you know, around our schools or our DPW or anyone else here tonight.

646
01:10:25,726 --> 01:10:28,367
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Cambridge has 35,000 more people.

647
01:10:28,507 --> 01:10:28,687
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

648
01:10:28,987 --> 01:10:33,289
[SPEAKER_03]: And the budgets for those departments are two, three, four times bigger than what we have here.

649
01:10:33,329 --> 01:10:41,371
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's, you know, that's a bigger regional problem, but I appreciate the discussion and I appreciate you saying it right to say we live in a very safe city does not mean there's no risk.

650
01:10:42,052 --> 01:10:45,673
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, the anxiety that's out there.

651
01:10:45,693 --> 01:10:50,274
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's important to remind people that everybody should pay attention to their surroundings, no matter where they are.

652
01:10:50,714 --> 01:10:52,195
[SPEAKER_18]: And you should be aware of what's going on.

653
01:10:52,652 --> 01:10:58,255
[SPEAKER_18]: You're walking around with your ears plugged up with ear headphones and you're listening to music and well, you know what?

654
01:10:58,915 --> 01:11:04,358
[SPEAKER_18]: I hope nothing happens to you, but you're opening yourself up to victimization if it's there, if the crime is gonna happen.

655
01:11:04,758 --> 01:11:06,559
[SPEAKER_18]: You make it easier for someone to target you.

656
01:11:07,139 --> 01:11:10,961
[SPEAKER_18]: So at least have one ear open so you can hear what's going on around you.

657
01:11:10,981 --> 01:11:19,565
[SPEAKER_18]: And oftentimes just the matter of looking at someone will defer them away if they know you're alert and willing to at least see them.

658
01:11:20,925 --> 01:11:22,206
[SPEAKER_18]: So, you know, people have,

659
01:11:23,047 --> 01:11:27,109
[SPEAKER_18]: an obligation of their own to try and do little things to keep themselves safe.

660
01:11:27,570 --> 01:11:36,135
[SPEAKER_18]: But in general, this is a very safe city, and you don't have to worry about where you're walking around, but some of us do by nature, so.

661
01:11:36,175 --> 01:11:36,735
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I get it.

662
01:11:37,636 --> 01:11:46,881
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, I have a few, I'm gonna go to Councilor Sanz, then Councilor Zara, then back to Councilor Lemming, and then we gotta move this along, y'all.

663
01:11:46,901 --> 01:11:47,541
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be quicker.

664
01:11:49,142 --> 01:11:51,344
[SPEAKER_06]: I do appreciate all your answers, and for,

665
01:11:53,055 --> 01:11:53,815
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a running joke now.

666
01:11:53,875 --> 01:11:58,517
[SPEAKER_06]: I thank you for your service to the city as well.

667
01:11:58,617 --> 01:12:04,718
[SPEAKER_06]: My quick question was, we all know that the federal landscape is a little insecure when it comes to funding.

668
01:12:05,619 --> 01:12:09,460
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have a lot of departments here in the city that rely on federal grant funding.

669
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:17,302
[SPEAKER_06]: I was wondering if you knew of any federal grants that you guys rely on, and if that is... I do a grant right now.

670
01:12:17,322 --> 01:12:20,883
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a full approved best partnership grant where we output

671
01:12:22,561 --> 01:12:28,844
[SPEAKER_02]: our offices with the best possible ballistic armor that we can actually give them.

672
01:12:28,864 --> 01:12:32,925
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

673
01:12:32,945 --> 01:12:34,546
[SPEAKER_02]: And part of that's federal funding.

674
01:12:34,986 --> 01:12:37,447
[SPEAKER_02]: And as of right now, we've not had a problem with that.

675
01:12:37,927 --> 01:12:42,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time I do purchase vests, I do get all the money back.

676
01:12:42,309 --> 01:12:48,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Once the federal side of things gives us 50% of the money for that vest, usually the vest costs almost $1,200.

677
01:12:49,990 --> 01:12:58,932
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I applied to the state executive office of public safety and they'll pay 50%, but only when the federal side pays 50%.

678
01:12:59,992 --> 01:13:03,733
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've never, I haven't experienced any problems yet.

679
01:13:03,753 --> 01:13:10,794
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been doing it since 2001 up until just recently, I just did a reimbursement recently and we got everything.

680
01:13:11,214 --> 01:13:13,755
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that, that's the only federal one that I deal with.

681
01:13:13,815 --> 01:13:15,055
[SPEAKER_02]: I deal with a lot of state grants.

682
01:13:17,048 --> 01:13:21,089
[SPEAKER_02]: 9-1-1 grants, training grants, support and incentive grants, all for 9-1-1.

683
01:13:21,690 --> 01:13:22,690
[SPEAKER_02]: No problem with the state.

684
01:13:23,370 --> 01:13:27,371
[SPEAKER_02]: But the only federal one that I have is that one, and I've not had a problem yet.

685
01:13:28,672 --> 01:13:29,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Knock on wood.

686
01:13:29,272 --> 01:13:30,412
[SPEAKER_02]: And we replace those vests.

687
01:13:30,472 --> 01:13:32,093
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to replace them every five years.

688
01:13:33,936 --> 01:13:44,121
[SPEAKER_02]: because of wear and tear and you know, the National Institute of Justice deemed after testing that we have to replace it after five years to keep everybody up with the latest and greatest.

689
01:13:44,801 --> 01:13:50,564
[SPEAKER_02]: So everybody has, there's no cost to the city whatsoever, but we can provide the right equipment to all the officers.

690
01:13:52,604 --> 01:13:52,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

691
01:13:53,205 --> 01:13:53,625
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else?

692
01:13:53,905 --> 01:13:54,265
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all.

693
01:13:54,285 --> 01:13:54,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

694
01:13:54,605 --> 01:13:54,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

695
01:13:54,825 --> 01:13:55,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

696
01:13:55,286 --> 01:13:56,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Zaro.

697
01:13:57,518 --> 01:13:58,618
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, thank you guys for being here.

698
01:13:58,839 --> 01:14:01,039
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate the presentation.

699
01:14:01,740 --> 01:14:14,665
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to say that there aren't that many opportunities for our residents who sometimes have, as you, Officer Covino mentioned, may hear rumors or see things on the news, social media.

700
01:14:14,985 --> 01:14:20,807
[SPEAKER_11]: I just think, I really appreciate your candid response to what President Barras was asking about.

701
01:14:23,388 --> 01:14:24,389
[SPEAKER_11]: Trust is really important.

702
01:14:24,929 --> 01:14:26,730
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a really big budget and

703
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:36,109
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't make sense for our residents to mistrust the police department when its whole job is to take care of them.

704
01:14:38,250 --> 01:14:46,675
[SPEAKER_11]: if they're nervous, we should openly explain, answer their questions, explain what's going on to the best of our ability.

705
01:14:46,755 --> 01:14:50,958
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is a great, I mean, not that many people watch these meetings, but they could.

706
01:14:52,138 --> 01:14:59,062
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's a great opportunity to talk really openly and honestly about the things that you all know that we may not and answer

707
01:15:00,143 --> 01:15:00,743
[SPEAKER_11]: their concerns.

708
01:15:01,264 --> 01:15:05,446
[SPEAKER_11]: So I really, really, really appreciate you doing that.

709
01:15:06,566 --> 01:15:07,987
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that's how we build trust.

710
01:15:08,047 --> 01:15:12,689
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's really important to build trust because you're what we have.

711
01:15:14,090 --> 01:15:15,290
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're very lucky to have that.

712
01:15:16,631 --> 01:15:18,111
[SPEAKER_11]: We're very lucky to have that partnership.

713
01:15:18,151 --> 01:15:25,135
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's really wonderful to be able to ask a question, get a straight answer from you, and know that

714
01:15:26,476 --> 01:15:28,297
[SPEAKER_11]: that that honesty and that exchange is there.

715
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:30,038
[SPEAKER_11]: So I really appreciated that.

716
01:15:30,879 --> 01:15:46,832
[SPEAKER_11]: I really think that what you said about like cooperation and trust being the thing that's gonna get us sort of through the uncertainty is very true.

717
01:15:47,232 --> 01:15:49,594
[SPEAKER_11]: So I appreciate that very much and thank you.

718
01:15:49,614 --> 01:15:50,195
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

719
01:15:51,996 --> 01:15:52,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Lemming.

720
01:15:55,713 --> 01:15:57,475
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd also like to repeat that as well.

721
01:15:57,535 --> 01:16:03,983
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you all very much for your service and I do appreciate that oftentimes y'all are between a rock and a hard place.

722
01:16:04,003 --> 01:16:11,193
[SPEAKER_10]: There's been a couple of instances where I've seen something reported on the news, and then I'll have a conversation with the police chief and then he kind of

723
01:16:11,833 --> 01:16:18,277
[SPEAKER_10]: will explain the logistics behind what actually happened and how it was misreported, just as you did during this meeting.

724
01:16:18,317 --> 01:16:24,000
[SPEAKER_10]: So things like that happen cyclically and very often.

725
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:27,401
[SPEAKER_10]: My only question is, would it be any

726
01:16:29,590 --> 01:16:57,194
[SPEAKER_10]: what do you think would be something you'd be able to do logistically to periodically report to the city or let the city know in an official form when those instances when you do have run-ins with ICE or when you are aware after the fact of their activity, you're explaining it to us publicly right now, so do you think it would be a possibility to put that into some kind of a periodic report just so that we don't have to keep asking y'all to

727
01:16:57,794 --> 01:17:02,559
[SPEAKER_10]: come back here and let us know what happened and these sorts in these formats.

728
01:17:03,559 --> 01:17:18,013
[SPEAKER_18]: To answer that I know, working with Chief Buckley he's been, we've been in the process of trying to come up with a way to keep count of that we don't normally keep count of it because they don't, they may check in with us in the morning but they don't call us and say hey, we grabbed three people in your city.

729
01:17:18,373 --> 01:17:18,873
[SPEAKER_18]: See you later.

730
01:17:19,874 --> 01:17:21,476
[SPEAKER_18]: They take their prisoners and they leave.

731
01:17:22,036 --> 01:17:28,961
[SPEAKER_18]: So, sometimes we may see them and say okay they've got some people but they don't bring them back to our station for processing.

732
01:17:29,341 --> 01:17:32,244
[SPEAKER_18]: So we really don't know what their outcome is when they leave.

733
01:17:33,064 --> 01:17:44,132
[SPEAKER_18]: It is something we're trying to get a grip on at least to try and maybe give you some numbers of how many times that they've arrested someone in our city, but we have to work with the Immigration Department on that.

734
01:17:44,813 --> 01:17:46,614
[SPEAKER_18]: And we're certainly looking into it.

735
01:17:47,755 --> 01:17:47,875
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

736
01:17:49,305 --> 01:18:07,997
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, I'm mainly asking because we, we have a resolution later on tonight's agenda about that explicitly and I just, while you're here I just want to know how, like I just want your thoughts on how well you're, you'd be able to carry that out or if you think that that would be

737
01:18:08,757 --> 01:18:31,369
[SPEAKER_10]: um an issue logistically on your end like I don't think it would be too much trouble for you to say like hey we you know we saw ice break a window on this car this is you know this is what happened I understand there's some arrests that you can't speak as publicly about or which are I mean sometimes like we talked about the incident where you saw that the agent break the window um

738
01:18:33,417 --> 01:18:36,681
[SPEAKER_18]: behind the scenes, what happened was, as I said, you're under arrest.

739
01:18:37,302 --> 01:18:38,363
[SPEAKER_18]: Nope, I'm not coming out.

740
01:18:38,564 --> 01:18:43,930
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, the law allows you to use a certain amount of force to obtain that person.

741
01:18:44,391 --> 01:18:46,513
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, you already explained that situation.

742
01:18:46,533 --> 01:18:48,816
[SPEAKER_18]: The public doesn't get that.

743
01:18:48,956 --> 01:18:51,860
[SPEAKER_18]: What the portrayal out there is they just smash the window in and done it.

744
01:18:52,904 --> 01:18:55,908
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're, I think we're going back over some ground we've already covered.

745
01:18:56,388 --> 01:19:05,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and I want to get to our DPW in our schools, because I have about 50 middle school and high school orchestra students waiting out there to play us music.

746
01:19:05,639 --> 01:19:09,183
[SPEAKER_18]: The answer to you, I believe what you're asking is if we could try and keep track of it.

747
01:19:09,684 --> 01:19:11,466
[SPEAKER_18]: Right now we do not have the ability to

748
01:19:11,886 --> 01:19:17,107
[SPEAKER_18]: keep an accurate count of how many times they come in the city and take someone.

749
01:19:17,727 --> 01:19:24,648
[SPEAKER_18]: But I know Chief Buckley has worked in the past with somebody from the Immigration Department about trying to get that information.

750
01:19:25,108 --> 01:19:33,010
[SPEAKER_18]: And if we can work, get a count from them, we could weekly say, okay, they were here this many times they arrested this many people a monthly whatever it is.

751
01:19:33,910 --> 01:19:34,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so it is.

752
01:19:34,570 --> 01:19:36,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it sounds like the answer is yes.

753
01:19:36,610 --> 01:19:38,271
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're working on it where exactly.

754
01:19:38,491 --> 01:19:38,831
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

755
01:19:38,951 --> 01:19:39,171
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

756
01:19:39,191 --> 01:19:39,931
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all I wanted to know.

757
01:19:41,111 --> 01:19:53,458
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's when I was talking about information, that was another piece I was saying, I think being able to, if residents have questions and concerns to be able to say, here's the information we have, here's the things we don't know and can't provide, here's what we do know.

758
01:19:54,019 --> 01:19:56,480
[SPEAKER_03]: They checked in three times this week, you know, things like that.

759
01:19:57,300 --> 01:19:58,101
[SPEAKER_03]: And I appreciate that.

760
01:19:58,121 --> 01:19:59,262
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's helpful too.

761
01:19:59,842 --> 01:20:03,564
[SPEAKER_03]: I just really quickly, because we do have a public comment on this as well.

762
01:20:05,245 --> 01:20:08,767
[SPEAKER_03]: You mind if I go over the traffic commission and the traffic supervisor budget really quickly?

763
01:20:09,725 --> 01:20:09,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

764
01:20:10,385 --> 01:20:17,829
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have the traffic commission fiscal 25 budget $30,500 fiscal 26 proposed $30,500.

765
01:20:18,429 --> 01:20:24,292
[SPEAKER_03]: So no change for the traffic commission and traffic supervisors.

766
01:20:25,312 --> 01:20:31,695
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are our part time folks who are out there keeping kids safe after school crossing guards.

767
01:20:31,715 --> 01:20:35,037
[SPEAKER_03]: This is another name people might know them by we have fiscal 25 budget

768
01:20:37,263 --> 01:20:44,047
[SPEAKER_03]: 361,525 and fiscal 26 proposed 370,500 for a change of 7,775.

769
01:20:44,568 --> 01:20:49,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anything you'd like to talk about our traffic supervisors or the traffic commission, either of you guys?

770
01:20:50,011 --> 01:20:55,395
[SPEAKER_04]: No, just the difference in the traffic supervisors was just a 2% raise effective July 1st.

771
01:20:55,935 --> 01:20:56,135
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

772
01:20:56,656 --> 01:20:58,077
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's barely the only variance.

773
01:20:58,217 --> 01:21:01,519
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's part of the non-union, because they're non-union, right?

774
01:21:01,579 --> 01:21:01,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Union.

775
01:21:02,059 --> 01:21:02,600
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, they're union.

776
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:04,061
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is part of their contract.

777
01:21:04,101 --> 01:21:04,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

778
01:21:04,581 --> 01:21:04,801
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

779
01:21:04,901 --> 01:21:05,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry about that.

780
01:21:05,602 --> 01:21:05,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

781
01:21:07,914 --> 01:21:11,776
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, do we have any questions from members of the council about the Traffic Supervisors and Traffic Commission?

782
01:21:14,597 --> 01:21:19,179
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we'll go to public comment on the Police Budget, Traffic Commission and Traffic Supervisors.

783
01:21:19,199 --> 01:21:21,500
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyone in the chambers who would like to speak?

784
01:21:23,622 --> 01:21:25,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Seeing none, we'll go to Zoom.

785
01:21:25,282 --> 01:21:32,446
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll recognize Micah Kesselman, name and address for the record, and you'll have three minutes.

786
01:21:32,486 --> 01:21:34,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Give me one second to get the timer going.

787
01:21:39,022 --> 01:21:39,522
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, there we go.

788
01:21:39,662 --> 01:21:40,843
[SPEAKER_15]: Cool.

789
01:21:40,883 --> 01:21:43,804
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, my name is Micah Kesselman, and I live at 499 Main Street.

790
01:21:45,405 --> 01:21:52,909
[SPEAKER_15]: So first, just thanks for showing up and giving us these answers from the police department.

791
01:21:52,929 --> 01:21:53,589
[SPEAKER_15]: I appreciate it.

792
01:21:53,609 --> 01:21:54,989
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sure a lot of residents do.

793
01:21:55,910 --> 01:22:01,793
[SPEAKER_15]: I will try and be fast, because I have three things I would like to at least make comment on or get an answer to, if possible.

794
01:22:02,133 --> 01:22:04,774
[SPEAKER_15]: So the first one is,

795
01:22:07,413 --> 01:22:12,721
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you have any mechanisms in your hiring process to guard against applicants who

796
01:22:25,002 --> 01:22:30,047
[SPEAKER_15]: were dismissed from other positions in other cities from being hired into our police force.

797
01:22:30,808 --> 01:22:41,661
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that's a really important thing to try and tackle because this is a, maybe it's not as much of an issue for those in the know, but at least the public perception is that this is a major concern and problem with police forces today.

798
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:58,844
[SPEAKER_15]: The other thing I wanted to mention was that, as the counselor said, and as you all even sort of attested to, violent crime and crime overall is down across the board across the country.

799
01:22:59,904 --> 01:23:08,466
[SPEAKER_15]: However, just like you said, nevertheless, we do live in an age and time where it is constantly

800
01:23:10,639 --> 01:23:20,072
[SPEAKER_15]: thrown at us and put in our faces and forced down our throats, whether we want to see it or not, and we're saturated with over-reporting on it.

801
01:23:21,082 --> 01:23:29,726
[SPEAKER_15]: And my concern when it comes to that is just like you said, this puts our police officers on edge.

802
01:23:30,706 --> 01:23:35,929
[SPEAKER_15]: This creates an environment of fear from our law enforcement, which isn't good for anyone.

803
01:23:36,529 --> 01:23:41,171
[SPEAKER_15]: You don't want the folks with the state-sanctioned authority to shoot people to be scared all the time.

804
01:23:41,771 --> 01:23:43,832
[SPEAKER_15]: So in your mental health

805
01:23:44,817 --> 01:23:57,145
[SPEAKER_15]: upkeep and assistance internally is dealing with this totally disproportionate overemphasis of how violent crime is nowadays.

806
01:23:57,465 --> 01:23:58,445
[SPEAKER_15]: Is this addressed?

807
01:23:58,546 --> 01:24:05,890
[SPEAKER_15]: Is this something that you actually try to help counsel police officers through and understand and get a grip on?

808
01:24:07,671 --> 01:24:12,014
[SPEAKER_15]: And the final thing I'll say with like 30 seconds on the clock,

809
01:24:13,094 --> 01:24:20,142
[SPEAKER_15]: is that there were some misstatements made about whether or not arrests can be made.

810
01:24:20,642 --> 01:24:27,650
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a fundamental right in this country, everyone has a fundamental right in this country, to be free from unlawful arrest.

811
01:24:28,422 --> 01:24:32,704
[SPEAKER_15]: What makes an arrest lawful is very strictly defined, very narrowly defined.

812
01:24:33,284 --> 01:24:50,030
[SPEAKER_15]: You have to be able to provide proof of an lawful order of arrest, or in very narrow circumstances, if there's, for ICE in particular, if there is reason to believe that the person would flee should you get a warrant, then they can make an unwarranted arrest, right?

813
01:24:50,710 --> 01:24:56,372
[SPEAKER_15]: However, that flies in the face of if you have time to plan and ambush a person to make an arrest,

814
01:24:57,092 --> 01:25:03,320
[SPEAKER_15]: Obviously, you have time to make, to get an order for it and be able to produce that order upon request.

815
01:25:04,725 --> 01:25:16,390
[SPEAKER_15]: And likewise, there's some very clearly incorrect stuff being said by both sides about what happened in New Bedford with the smashing grab through the windshield by ICE.

816
01:25:18,711 --> 01:25:21,572
[SPEAKER_15]: They had a warrant for the wrong person there.

817
01:25:21,712 --> 01:25:22,532
[SPEAKER_15]: This is all on video.

818
01:25:22,873 --> 01:25:24,373
[SPEAKER_15]: So they had a warrant for the wrong person.

819
01:25:24,833 --> 01:25:27,014
[SPEAKER_15]: And he was calling his attorney when they broke his window.

820
01:25:27,474 --> 01:25:29,615
[SPEAKER_15]: So that is very problematic.

821
01:25:29,695 --> 01:25:31,836
[SPEAKER_15]: It wasn't him just resisting arrest.

822
01:25:32,636 --> 01:25:33,317
[SPEAKER_15]: That's it for me.

823
01:25:33,417 --> 01:25:33,777
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks, guys.

824
01:25:35,383 --> 01:25:35,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

825
01:25:37,597 --> 01:25:39,419
[SPEAKER_03]: I had two questions there.

826
01:25:39,599 --> 01:25:46,484
[SPEAKER_03]: I had, are there mechanisms to guard against advocates dismissed from other police forces in the hiring process?

827
01:25:47,405 --> 01:25:57,874
[SPEAKER_03]: And how are we dealing with this oversaturation of like crime in our media, social media, and how that impacts mental health for officers?

828
01:25:58,134 --> 01:25:59,795
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can feel free to respond to them.

829
01:25:59,815 --> 01:26:00,696
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to restate them.

830
01:26:00,716 --> 01:26:01,276
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to.

831
01:26:01,296 --> 01:26:05,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think as far as that first question there, we do an extensive background

832
01:26:06,667 --> 01:26:24,893
[SPEAKER_02]: And if, you know, part of that background is looking at prior employment, if somebody is dismissed for whatever reason from another, I think the gentleman said another police agency, you know, we do an extensive background, that's a red flag, obviously, that person's not gonna get hired.

833
01:26:26,754 --> 01:26:35,977
[SPEAKER_02]: So the people we put on, they pass that background investigation, they pass everything, and they're strong candidates going in.

834
01:26:36,835 --> 01:26:38,797
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we wouldn't have to worry about that.

835
01:26:40,980 --> 01:26:48,769
[SPEAKER_13]: And so just to clarify one point on this, we're a post, in Massachusetts we have post.

836
01:26:49,870 --> 01:26:53,374
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's something called a National De-Certification Index.

837
01:26:54,227 --> 01:27:00,954
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, when I do a back, when I begin a background investigation on somebody, they're run through the national decertification index.

838
01:27:01,475 --> 01:27:07,481
[SPEAKER_13]: So if they have been decertified by any state in the union, they will not get on the Medford Police Department.

839
01:27:07,942 --> 01:27:11,185
[SPEAKER_13]: So that first question is easily answered.

840
01:27:11,245 --> 01:27:12,507
[SPEAKER_13]: There is no revolving door.

841
01:27:12,547 --> 01:27:16,311
[SPEAKER_13]: If you're dismissed from another police department, you're not getting on the police department here in Medford.

842
01:27:17,615 --> 01:27:19,256
[SPEAKER_02]: That's part of the investigation.

843
01:27:19,636 --> 01:27:21,657
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to happen.

844
01:27:21,757 --> 01:27:22,958
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's not going to happen.

845
01:27:22,998 --> 01:27:24,059
[SPEAKER_13]: What was the second question?

846
01:27:25,059 --> 01:27:31,923
[SPEAKER_03]: It was when we're talking about providing mental health support and treatment for our officers, how are we talking about, you know,

847
01:27:32,829 --> 01:27:42,971
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of this culture of fear that we're all living in, for lack of a better term, where we see a lot of violence on our phones and on TV and on the media that isn't really as reflective of our day-to-day experience.

848
01:27:43,191 --> 01:27:46,492
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, we do a lot as far as mental health for our officers.

849
01:27:46,812 --> 01:27:56,674
[SPEAKER_13]: One of the statistics that a lot of people don't realize is although officers are injured and killed on duty a lot, the number one cause of death for police officers is suicide.

850
01:27:56,974 --> 01:27:57,154
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

851
01:27:57,514 --> 01:27:59,355
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's something that we have to clarify.

852
01:27:59,915 --> 01:28:00,955
[SPEAKER_13]: We do do extensive

853
01:28:01,635 --> 01:28:03,676
[SPEAKER_13]: mental health training at the Metro Police Department.

854
01:28:04,736 --> 01:28:09,458
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're hoping with this new budget to do a lot more and some robust training.

855
01:28:11,059 --> 01:28:13,260
[SPEAKER_13]: So as far as that goes, we're doing quite a bit.

856
01:28:14,020 --> 01:28:16,822
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we're doing a lot more than a lot of the communities around us.

857
01:28:18,262 --> 01:28:20,703
[SPEAKER_13]: And the third question, I think that was more of a statement than anything else.

858
01:28:20,803 --> 01:28:21,043
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.

859
01:28:21,223 --> 01:28:21,504
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

860
01:28:22,284 --> 01:28:22,464
[SPEAKER_18]: Great.

861
01:28:24,315 --> 01:28:25,976
[SPEAKER_18]: Regards to the mental health is one of the thing.

862
01:28:26,717 --> 01:28:38,667
[SPEAKER_18]: The biggest component is that is the officers that respond to seriously, mostly violent crimes, even if it's a crime or even a motor vehicle accident or a sure a suicide.

863
01:28:39,488 --> 01:28:42,530
[SPEAKER_18]: They're all impacted somehow we now belong to the greater Boston.

864
01:28:43,031 --> 01:28:47,775
[SPEAKER_18]: So the system unit which is made up of several cities and towns around Boston.

865
01:28:48,555 --> 01:29:01,302
[SPEAKER_18]: It's, there are police officers involved, civilian clinicians clergy, and when you have an incident where you could, we've had some where our whole shift was involved with a suicide of a juvenile, and we had them come in.

866
01:29:02,006 --> 01:29:11,569
[SPEAKER_18]: And they're great and what they do is, is it in the beginning it's called the diffusion, and they bring everybody in in a group they talk, they come up.

867
01:29:12,049 --> 01:29:20,992
[SPEAKER_18]: And if the person running it thinks there's usually a group of them involved there's not just one officer there there might be an officer that might be usually a civilian clinician that could

868
01:29:21,732 --> 01:29:24,134
[SPEAKER_18]: a clergy, and it might be a couple officers involved.

869
01:29:24,154 --> 01:29:30,639
[SPEAKER_18]: They're all trained at certain levels of running these diffusions, debriefings, and peer support groups.

870
01:29:31,099 --> 01:29:34,522
[SPEAKER_18]: So they would obviously leave contact information.

871
01:29:34,622 --> 01:29:35,883
[SPEAKER_18]: It's all privileged information.

872
01:29:35,923 --> 01:29:39,606
[SPEAKER_18]: It doesn't come back to us, the command staff, unless somebody needs more help.

873
01:29:40,146 --> 01:29:42,748
[SPEAKER_18]: And then we would go up to a next level to get them more help.

874
01:29:43,209 --> 01:29:48,593
[SPEAKER_18]: But that is one of the biggest problems that law enforcement has overlooked for many years, and now we're part of that.

875
01:29:49,173 --> 01:29:59,567
[SPEAKER_18]: Hopefully, in many ways to we have offices that are certified to respond to other cities and towns to help out with programs and as because you don't use offices from your own city to do this.

876
01:30:00,128 --> 01:30:03,933
[SPEAKER_18]: So, that's one of our biggest upgrades in the last couple years.

877
01:30:05,417 --> 01:30:07,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for both of you for the helpful answers, all of you.

878
01:30:08,059 --> 01:30:14,684
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know also, you know, when we talk about guns, death by suicide is the most common thing that happens.

879
01:30:14,824 --> 01:30:17,906
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we see someone die on the other end of a gun as well.

880
01:30:17,986 --> 01:30:26,432
[SPEAKER_03]: So appreciate you bringing that up and that we're working on it in a really seemingly, it seems like it's an intense and intensive way.

881
01:30:28,950 --> 01:30:36,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Seeing no more questions or public comments, unless there's anyone who wants to raise their hand on Zoom or stand up in the chamber.

882
01:30:37,258 --> 01:30:37,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, you guys.

883
01:30:37,819 --> 01:30:38,679
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, thank you.

884
01:30:38,820 --> 01:30:39,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for having us.

885
01:30:39,480 --> 01:30:43,644
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Tim and Owen.

886
01:30:48,711 --> 01:30:50,572
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotta do the schools too, so we're going over.

887
01:30:50,592 --> 01:30:53,053
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, that's just half the budget, right?

888
01:30:53,073 --> 01:30:53,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Four minutes.

889
01:30:55,375 --> 01:30:56,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Jerry's got a PowerPoint, so.

890
01:31:01,198 --> 01:31:02,998
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, I will go through this.

891
01:31:07,641 --> 01:31:09,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just go through alphabetically.

892
01:31:10,393 --> 01:31:17,137
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's anything you want to talk about introduction wise at the beginning for overall departmental operations to Commissioner McGivern.

893
01:31:17,818 --> 01:31:22,361
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll see the floor to you and then we can go through on each, each section of your department.

894
01:31:22,381 --> 01:31:25,823
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, I have just a quick presentation oral presentation, great.

895
01:31:26,203 --> 01:31:28,785
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll be quick about it, it's not too long, page and a half.

896
01:31:29,465 --> 01:31:33,508
[SPEAKER_07]: So, quick overview of the DPW total budgets $44.3 million.

897
01:31:34,309 --> 01:31:36,611
[SPEAKER_07]: That's about a 3% increase from FY 25.

898
01:31:37,251 --> 01:31:46,378
[SPEAKER_07]: It's funded 38% by general funds 61% by water enterprise, and then about a combined 1% for perpetual care and sale of lots and graves.

899
01:31:47,258 --> 01:32:01,521
[SPEAKER_07]: The Water Division, which is 61% of the budget, we maintain 135 miles of water distribution pipe, sewer piping, 14,700 services with their meters, provide water quality services, retail supplier of MWRA water.

900
01:32:02,401 --> 01:32:13,243
[SPEAKER_07]: The Highway Division, which is 31% of our budget, maintain and operate 95 miles of public roadways, the city's public parking lots, and we have limited services on the 29 miles of private ways as well.

901
01:32:16,377 --> 01:32:18,118
[SPEAKER_07]: Cemetery, 3% of our budget.

902
01:32:18,359 --> 01:32:20,380
[SPEAKER_07]: We maintain and operate the Oak Grove Cemetery.

903
01:32:20,440 --> 01:32:22,202
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about a hundred acres in size.

904
01:32:22,222 --> 01:32:24,463
[SPEAKER_07]: 65,000 loved ones are buried there.

905
01:32:24,483 --> 01:32:29,327
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a couple of buildings that need work and we're working on some burial expansion.

906
01:32:30,308 --> 01:32:32,650
[SPEAKER_07]: Parks, that's 2% of our budget.

907
01:32:32,670 --> 01:32:43,899
[SPEAKER_07]: We maintain and operate 23 parks, 14 playgrounds, athletic facilities, nine baseball fields, seven softball fields, four soccer fields, 13 basketball courts, nine tennis courts, and a pickleball court.

908
01:32:44,993 --> 01:32:50,817
[SPEAKER_07]: Forestry, we have close to 10,000 public trees that was recently completed in an inventory that we just did.

909
01:32:50,877 --> 01:32:52,578
[SPEAKER_07]: So now we know how many trees we have.

910
01:32:53,479 --> 01:32:57,982
[SPEAKER_07]: We're working on completing an urban forest master plan to help guide the forestry division and our canopy.

911
01:32:58,662 --> 01:32:59,943
[SPEAKER_07]: And we've planted over 200 trees this year.

912
01:33:01,370 --> 01:33:06,172
[SPEAKER_07]: Fleet maintenance, we oversee 240 vehicles, the maintenance of them.

913
01:33:06,792 --> 01:33:12,414
[SPEAKER_07]: That includes 27 fire apparatus, 51 police vehicles, and 20 pieces of heavy equipment.

914
01:33:13,334 --> 01:33:15,935
[SPEAKER_07]: Engineering, which is approximately 2% of our budget.

915
01:33:16,276 --> 01:33:16,756
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I'm sorry.

916
01:33:17,276 --> 01:33:18,396
[SPEAKER_07]: Nope, that was right.

917
01:33:18,596 --> 01:33:19,617
[SPEAKER_07]: About 2% of our budget.

918
01:33:20,157 --> 01:33:24,519
[SPEAKER_07]: Many accomplishments, I'll let Owen talk about those, but maybe we'll just pause on that for a second.

919
01:33:24,539 --> 01:33:25,779
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll take that separately, yeah.

920
01:33:25,819 --> 01:33:26,679
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we'll just finish this.

921
01:33:28,494 --> 01:33:29,995
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll see some changes in the budget this year.

922
01:33:30,755 --> 01:33:36,838
[SPEAKER_07]: We've increased training budgets for highway and forestry for both skills and safety.

923
01:33:37,718 --> 01:33:44,701
[SPEAKER_07]: We have increases in waste, and it's primarily because of new contracts that we negotiated, new 10-year contracts.

924
01:33:44,741 --> 01:33:50,604
[SPEAKER_07]: So we went from a 10-year contract to a new set of 10-year contracts, and we are including composting services now.

925
01:33:51,525 --> 01:33:52,785
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's a significant change.

926
01:33:57,207 --> 01:34:11,295
[SPEAKER_07]: personnel from the override we're still working on that and we've done all the internal movements basically now we have three new positions from that override available outward facing so we're accepting applications and interviewing.

927
01:34:13,436 --> 01:34:22,621
[SPEAKER_07]: We also transferred one position from cemetery to highway we're doing all kinds of lead work we have a whole all kinds of stormwater work that we're doing with ms4 a new permit coming

928
01:34:23,967 --> 01:34:31,335
[SPEAKER_07]: We unfortunately had two members of the DPW pass away over this past year, relatively close together, William Ogonowski and Anthony Pompeo.

929
01:34:31,956 --> 01:34:41,306
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we've had a number of retirements, Earl Philbrook, Joe Souza, Mary Menezes, who's retiring at the end of June, and Richard Eckhart also in June.

930
01:34:42,805 --> 01:34:44,585
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a number of new employees that have joined us.

931
01:34:45,346 --> 01:34:50,667
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a lot of open positions in highway, water, and engineering specifically.

932
01:34:50,767 --> 01:34:54,248
[SPEAKER_07]: We are looking for folks to work in those three divisions.

933
01:34:55,228 --> 01:35:00,709
[SPEAKER_07]: Next year, a couple of things you're going to see, we're significantly ramping up lead removals.

934
01:35:01,189 --> 01:35:05,770
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a huge effort that Owen can talk more about and answer more questions on.

935
01:35:06,270 --> 01:35:12,152
[SPEAKER_07]: We have significant stormwater rules coming down from the EPA having to do with the discharges to the river and our stormwater system.

936
01:35:13,472 --> 01:35:15,653
[SPEAKER_07]: over the next year or so, we're gonna be hearing a lot more about that.

937
01:35:16,973 --> 01:35:25,376
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, we have an increased focus on water quality, distribution, just basically water projects in general.

938
01:35:25,496 --> 01:35:32,618
[SPEAKER_07]: We have had for the last few years, we did water meters, and now we're moving on to all kinds of things that Owen can talk about.

939
01:35:32,678 --> 01:35:38,220
[SPEAKER_07]: We're gonna see Arlington Street next, right now we're doing Willis Avenue, Arlington Street's the next big project.

940
01:35:39,058 --> 01:35:39,518
[SPEAKER_07]: for water.

941
01:35:40,519 --> 01:35:53,023
[SPEAKER_07]: And then up at the cemetery we're continuing the capital improvements up there just working towards some some projects up there, preserving historic buildings, improving the roads and expanding burial space.

942
01:35:53,943 --> 01:35:59,125
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that, you know, we also have some very specific goals that we that we've outlined.

943
01:36:00,145 --> 01:36:02,366
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know, I've just given you guys a lot.

944
01:36:02,426 --> 01:36:04,047
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know you also have our budget sheet.

945
01:36:04,107 --> 01:36:04,247
[SPEAKER_07]: So

946
01:36:04,687 --> 01:36:10,028
[SPEAKER_07]: I think any remaining time we can focus on questions after we give Owen a couple minutes.

947
01:36:11,489 --> 01:36:16,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, okay we can start with engineering and I'm just going to read the engineering budget sheet.

948
01:36:17,310 --> 01:36:17,810
[SPEAKER_03]: Fiscal 25 budget 547,752.

949
01:36:17,850 --> 01:36:20,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Fiscal 26 budget proposed 719.82 for an increase of 171,330 and we have here

950
01:36:32,753 --> 01:36:42,339
[SPEAKER_03]: casino funded position, permanent employees, there's a significant fixed cost growth there, a new project manager position, and those are the main drivers.

951
01:36:42,399 --> 01:36:45,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything else is essentially inflationary.

952
01:36:45,721 --> 01:36:53,947
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a little bit of new training for GIS and a new monitor and laptop system in the conference room.

953
01:36:55,388 --> 01:36:55,608
[SPEAKER_03]: So

954
01:36:56,827 --> 01:37:01,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Three things I know Tim kind of went over this a little bit more, but we do have you here as our city engineer.

955
01:37:02,313 --> 01:37:05,816
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to talk anything more about the speak to those changes anymore.

956
01:37:06,016 --> 01:37:10,001
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so our big focus right now is getting the lead out.

957
01:37:10,661 --> 01:37:11,642
[SPEAKER_09]: We've instituted.

958
01:37:12,043 --> 01:37:16,647
[SPEAKER_09]: We're just beginning a project that's going to be multi year to get all the lead out by

959
01:37:17,989 --> 01:37:22,094
[SPEAKER_09]: 2032.

960
01:37:19,231 --> 01:37:22,094
[SPEAKER_09]: Along with that, we are going to be replacing the water mains.

961
01:37:22,595 --> 01:37:33,309
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're kind of like working our way in, doing water lines, service lines, doing the water mains, and we have multiple-year projects building off of that to replace at least two or three miles a year.

962
01:37:34,130 --> 01:37:39,971
[SPEAKER_09]: We've worked with the Water Commission to update the rates to allow us to fund these projects.

963
01:37:40,432 --> 01:37:43,532
[SPEAKER_09]: We've updated the floodplain ordinances with you all, your help.

964
01:37:43,832 --> 01:37:51,154
[SPEAKER_09]: We've updated the water sewer regulations to help us get in line with a lot of these upgrades to, with better water quality.

965
01:37:52,194 --> 01:38:03,477
[SPEAKER_09]: On top of that, we have also worked with the Highway Department to expand our roadway restoration backlog to decrease it.

966
01:38:04,318 --> 01:38:10,024
[SPEAKER_09]: and to expand the amount of repaving that we're doing and sidewalk work that we're doing.

967
01:38:10,404 --> 01:38:19,654
[SPEAKER_09]: We're also working with utility companies to get them to come back in to do restoration work that was owed to us.

968
01:38:21,056 --> 01:38:22,998
[SPEAKER_09]: National Grid should be wrapping that up this year.

969
01:38:25,538 --> 01:38:26,198
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's about it.

970
01:38:26,358 --> 01:38:29,479
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, also with stormwater, we're doing stormwater and sewer.

971
01:38:29,639 --> 01:38:35,560
[SPEAKER_09]: I and I, we're basically ramping up and just, we're ramping up is the big thing.

972
01:38:35,940 --> 01:38:38,601
[SPEAKER_09]: We're doing about four to five times the amount of work this year.

973
01:38:38,661 --> 01:38:40,481
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's, we're really getting going.

974
01:38:40,501 --> 01:38:42,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Compared to the current year or?

975
01:38:42,122 --> 01:38:43,722
[SPEAKER_09]: Just to years in the past.

976
01:38:43,742 --> 01:38:44,622
[SPEAKER_09]: We're starting to, yeah.

977
01:38:44,903 --> 01:38:46,263
[SPEAKER_09]: We're starting, you're going to start seeing it.

978
01:38:46,363 --> 01:38:48,743
[SPEAKER_09]: So before it was like a lot of studies, design work.

979
01:38:49,164 --> 01:38:51,524
[SPEAKER_09]: Now it's construction, construction, construction.

980
01:38:51,604 --> 01:38:54,505
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're going to see a lot of the roadways

981
01:38:57,207 --> 01:39:11,301
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we have openings in engineering in their higher level system city engineer, for example, so we're, you know, really looking for folks to fill those positions because basically every construction project you see out there needs full time engineers on those projects.

982
01:39:11,481 --> 01:39:12,462
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, right.

983
01:39:13,183 --> 01:39:16,847
[SPEAKER_03]: And is that part of what's driving this project manager position addition as well.

984
01:39:17,147 --> 01:39:17,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

985
01:39:17,687 --> 01:39:17,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

986
01:39:19,208 --> 01:39:20,889
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to jump the line here really quickly.

987
01:39:21,469 --> 01:39:33,893
[SPEAKER_03]: You brought up the two big things right, you guys, manage and do the design work on probably our two biggest capital assets which are all of the water and sewer pipes for everybody, and all of our streets and sidewalks.

988
01:39:35,993 --> 01:39:43,216
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been doing these studies these assessments, certainly on the road we've talked a little bit about pavement condition, you've been doing something similar for water sewer.

989
01:39:46,307 --> 01:39:48,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are we on a capital need basis?

990
01:39:48,628 --> 01:39:51,068
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it sounds like we're going to be doing a lot more now.

991
01:39:51,228 --> 01:39:58,910
[SPEAKER_03]: And it sounds like on the water sewer side that there's money coming from the fee structure for the water and sewer enterprise fund to help do that.

992
01:39:59,010 --> 01:39:59,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.

993
01:39:59,891 --> 01:40:02,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Roadside comes from the general fund and from state funds.

994
01:40:02,411 --> 01:40:05,732
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's not as easy a way to do the revenue element of that.

995
01:40:06,412 --> 01:40:07,773
[SPEAKER_03]: Could you talk a little bit more about

996
01:40:08,734 --> 01:40:13,396
[SPEAKER_03]: expectations and how are we really going to start seeing an improvement in these conditions?

997
01:40:13,456 --> 01:40:13,936
[SPEAKER_09]: We should.

998
01:40:14,837 --> 01:40:19,519
[SPEAKER_09]: With every water main project we're going to be coming in the following year to do the roadway restoration.

999
01:40:20,099 --> 01:40:26,802
[SPEAKER_09]: We're currently using chapter 90 funding to do that and we're going to get creative to figure out how to keep up with the water main replacement work.

1000
01:40:27,182 --> 01:40:32,007
[SPEAKER_07]: So and that's going to have chapter 90 increase their funding, not by a ton, but it's significant.

1001
01:40:32,207 --> 01:40:35,070
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll have a little bit more to spend in coming years.

1002
01:40:35,790 --> 01:40:39,554
[SPEAKER_07]: And I believe there's even talk in state budget now to make it even more.

1003
01:40:40,014 --> 01:40:42,717
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're one time doubling stuff like that.

1004
01:40:42,957 --> 01:40:49,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so and I think this different whether it's governor Haley's budget or the Senate houses I think there are some differences.

1005
01:40:50,201 --> 01:41:00,666
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, but I know the governor's budget did have an increased funding for roadway projects chapter nine specifically as part of the millionaires tax it.

1006
01:41:00,866 --> 01:41:01,887
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, a number of years ago.

1007
01:41:02,427 --> 01:41:03,588
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're looking forward to that.

1008
01:41:03,688 --> 01:41:04,388
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that

1009
01:41:04,928 --> 01:41:08,892
[SPEAKER_07]: our plans, I wouldn't say hinge on that, but we're looking forward to it.

1010
01:41:09,012 --> 01:41:12,234
[SPEAKER_03]: You could do significantly more if the state provided that investment.

1011
01:41:12,575 --> 01:41:14,056
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1012
01:41:14,156 --> 01:41:17,659
[SPEAKER_07]: And like going to like, so that rate study that we did with water that is just wrapping up now.

1013
01:41:18,740 --> 01:41:22,263
[SPEAKER_07]: That tells us a lot that came with the capital project recommendation.

1014
01:41:22,583 --> 01:41:30,249
[SPEAKER_07]: So we kind of have years one through six or so kind of worked out as far as what we're going to be doing for water capital projects to increase

1015
01:41:32,331 --> 01:41:43,898
[SPEAKER_07]: operations of our system, things like pressure, things like reducing unaccountable water, leaking pipes, things like that, improving water quality, getting unlined pipes out of the ground, getting lined good pipes in the ground.

1016
01:41:44,318 --> 01:41:48,121
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's on a very long-term look.

1017
01:41:48,701 --> 01:41:54,585
[SPEAKER_07]: So we took some time to study, now we know, and we're kind of easing into it.

1018
01:41:54,725 --> 01:41:58,147
[SPEAKER_07]: So year two is bigger than year one, year three is bigger than year two.

1019
01:41:58,993 --> 01:42:05,697
[SPEAKER_07]: if you kind of get my drift here, and we can take this for 30 years, 20 years, or 50 years, depending on how fast we move.

1020
01:42:06,097 --> 01:42:08,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's been going downhill for, what, 100, so.

1021
01:42:08,959 --> 01:42:15,403
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we have a pretty good road map now, and if folks are interested in learning more, they can contact the engineering officer in my office.

1022
01:42:15,883 --> 01:42:17,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, and there's materials posted on the website as well.

1023
01:42:18,345 --> 01:42:19,265
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1024
01:42:19,445 --> 01:42:24,008
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to go through and read the budget lines, since we've lumped it all together.

1025
01:42:24,028 --> 01:42:25,109
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just going to do that really quickly.

1026
01:42:26,502 --> 01:42:28,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Cemetery, we had $1,118,050 for fiscal 25.

1027
01:42:28,824 --> 01:42:29,544
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a reduction to $1,071,342.

1028
01:42:29,604 --> 01:42:30,565
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a reduction of $46,708.

1029
01:42:30,645 --> 01:42:31,466
[SPEAKER_03]: I already did engineering.

1030
01:42:31,506 --> 01:42:32,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Forestry, we had fiscal 25, $623,989.

1031
01:42:32,746 --> 01:42:34,448
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a small reduction to $618,365.

1032
01:42:53,299 --> 01:43:04,065
[SPEAKER_03]: There are reduced costs for arborist support and as well as some step increases and just generally some staffing funding there.

1033
01:43:04,966 --> 01:43:09,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Parks, we had fiscal 25, 950,578 and fiscal 26 proposed 954,765 and there's a net decrease of 2,813 there.

1034
01:43:23,082 --> 01:43:25,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Highway we had fiscal 25 budgeted $12,839,686.

1035
01:43:25,583 --> 01:43:27,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Fiscal 26 budget $13,984,161 for an increase of $1,104,000.

1036
01:43:39,643 --> 01:43:45,905
[SPEAKER_03]: $475.

1037
01:43:40,583 --> 01:43:45,905
[SPEAKER_03]: A huge chunk of this is our waste contract.

1038
01:43:45,945 --> 01:43:48,506
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like it's about $9.4 million this year.

1039
01:43:48,526 --> 01:43:51,987
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's an increase of $700,000 from last year.

1040
01:43:55,201 --> 01:44:09,836
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that's all the general fund departments and then we had water and sewer, which is the enterprise fund and that's, you know, funded by the, you know, rates the water and sewer rates fiscal 26 sorry fiscal 25 total was 26,937,511.

1041
01:44:15,361 --> 01:44:18,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Fiscal 26 is $26,966,670 for an increase of $29,159, which from a percentage basis actually rounds down to a 0% increase.

1042
01:44:28,576 --> 01:44:31,778
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the all of the budgets for our dpw.

1043
01:44:31,798 --> 01:44:40,103
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you at the beginning for going over and saying this is what percentage of your total dpw is enterprise fund and then the other department.

1044
01:44:40,743 --> 01:44:52,250
[SPEAKER_07]: So I realized in previous years I may not have been clear on that and so what I've been trying to do, and I'll do this moving forward as well as this year I have a full summary sheet with a breakdown of all those percentages and everything like that so

1045
01:44:53,090 --> 01:44:56,791
[SPEAKER_07]: We know how big DPW is and how each, how big each division is.

1046
01:44:56,911 --> 01:44:57,111
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

1047
01:44:57,212 --> 01:44:59,772
[SPEAKER_03]: If you could forward that to the clerk, he can distribute it to us.

1048
01:44:59,912 --> 01:45:02,373
[SPEAKER_03]: We can add it to the packet for this meeting online.

1049
01:45:02,613 --> 01:45:04,314
[SPEAKER_03]: And also I think it'd be great to put on the website.

1050
01:45:04,694 --> 01:45:04,894
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

1051
01:45:05,074 --> 01:45:05,234
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1052
01:45:05,274 --> 01:45:09,636
[SPEAKER_07]: It's basically the same data you have in front of you, but just synthesizes in a graph, a pie chart.

1053
01:45:09,796 --> 01:45:11,476
[SPEAKER_07]: Some sort of pie chart.

1054
01:45:11,656 --> 01:45:12,036
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

1055
01:45:12,056 --> 01:45:13,117
[SPEAKER_07]: Beautiful pie chart.

1056
01:45:13,277 --> 01:45:18,919
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was thinking about putting it in a presentation, but I want to make sure that it's, it's matches all, all the numbers match.

1057
01:45:19,079 --> 01:45:19,319
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

1058
01:45:19,399 --> 01:45:19,659
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1059
01:45:20,575 --> 01:45:20,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

1060
01:45:20,896 --> 01:45:26,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'm going to go to counselor saying counselors are and then counselor Scarpelli counselor saying.

1061
01:45:27,420 --> 01:45:27,780
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1062
01:45:28,661 --> 01:45:29,401
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll be quick.

1063
01:45:29,541 --> 01:45:30,422
[SPEAKER_06]: That was very efficient.

1064
01:45:31,783 --> 01:45:33,724
[SPEAKER_06]: President Behrs asked the first part of my question.

1065
01:45:33,784 --> 01:45:39,848
[SPEAKER_06]: I know a lot of residents are very excited about the construction projects, water and streets and sidewalks.

1066
01:45:40,689 --> 01:45:47,233
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just wanted to know where we are when it comes to capital needs and where we see ourselves on that timeline.

1067
01:45:47,753 --> 01:45:48,494
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was helpful.

1068
01:45:48,794 --> 01:45:52,236
[SPEAKER_06]: My second question is about, you mentioned that there are open positions.

1069
01:45:53,981 --> 01:45:55,523
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's going to be important to fill.

1070
01:45:56,525 --> 01:45:58,849
[SPEAKER_06]: How competitive do you think we are?

1071
01:45:58,909 --> 01:46:01,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think there are problems with recruitment?

1072
01:46:01,573 --> 01:46:06,902
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think that we need more money in the budget eventually for those positions?

1073
01:46:07,828 --> 01:46:10,151
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, you know, it's a good set of questions for sure.

1074
01:46:10,171 --> 01:46:13,394
[SPEAKER_07]: Our list of open positions is large right now.

1075
01:46:13,955 --> 01:46:22,785
[SPEAKER_07]: It's large, mostly due to some employees that were here leaving for better opportunities, especially in engineering, and that happens.

1076
01:46:23,385 --> 01:46:24,807
[SPEAKER_07]: So, just the timing is bad.

1077
01:46:26,329 --> 01:46:28,771
[SPEAKER_07]: So good for them bad for us really, you know.

1078
01:46:30,717 --> 01:46:36,598
[SPEAKER_07]: We have had some of the positions open for a while and we are trying to get creative, especially water superintendent.

1079
01:46:37,298 --> 01:46:39,639
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a big one that's been open for quite some time.

1080
01:46:40,239 --> 01:46:41,239
[SPEAKER_07]: We've increased it.

1081
01:46:41,619 --> 01:46:49,461
[SPEAKER_07]: We've added some benefits, but we're still having some trouble, but we'll see how things go.

1082
01:46:49,501 --> 01:46:52,661
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully there's an internal people that are working on licenses.

1083
01:46:53,001 --> 01:46:55,342
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll see, you need a very specific license for that.

1084
01:46:56,042 --> 01:46:58,225
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, you know, how do we compare it.

1085
01:46:58,726 --> 01:47:11,260
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you know we have some pros to working in the public sector that I think not, not a lot of folks realize so you know our salaries could be a little bit higher comparing to other municipalities but I think the competitive.

1086
01:47:12,640 --> 01:47:16,801
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, I think that some of it is just the market.

1087
01:47:17,322 --> 01:47:29,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Somerville is also having troubles, without naming other municipalities, I just named one, but other municipalities around us, not just Somerville, but other ones are also having trouble finding people to work in the water division, as well as mechanics.

1088
01:47:29,405 --> 01:47:30,445
[SPEAKER_07]: That's another big one.

1089
01:47:31,245 --> 01:47:34,146
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now, out in the private world, mechanics are hot.

1090
01:47:34,646 --> 01:47:35,586
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're paying $50 an hour.

1091
01:47:35,606 --> 01:47:36,167
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't pay $50 an hour.

1092
01:47:38,577 --> 01:47:40,078
[SPEAKER_07]: But that job is very different.

1093
01:47:40,538 --> 01:47:53,886
[SPEAKER_07]: Working at Verizon or Penske Fleet or whatever, U-Haul Fleet, that's very different than working in the public sector fleet and all the different types of vehicles that we work on, our state-of-the-art shop, how we track our work.

1094
01:47:54,326 --> 01:47:55,166
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all very different.

1095
01:47:55,246 --> 01:47:59,789
[SPEAKER_07]: So we do have some perks there that we're hoping to leverage.

1096
01:48:00,589 --> 01:48:01,650
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully that answers your question.

1097
01:48:03,511 --> 01:48:03,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1098
01:48:03,851 --> 01:48:04,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1099
01:48:04,171 --> 01:48:05,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Lazaro.

1100
01:48:07,171 --> 01:48:08,072
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, thanks for being here.

1101
01:48:08,993 --> 01:48:10,134
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you coordinate your outfits?

1102
01:48:10,654 --> 01:48:11,215
[SPEAKER_11]: First question.

1103
01:48:12,416 --> 01:48:13,777
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they always look like that.

1104
01:48:14,718 --> 01:48:15,659
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm no time for jokes.

1105
01:48:15,679 --> 01:48:18,041
[SPEAKER_11]: There's no time for jokes.

1106
01:48:19,182 --> 01:48:24,907
[SPEAKER_11]: Second question is, is the EPA grant still happening for the water main replacements?

1107
01:48:26,028 --> 01:48:26,469
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, great.

1108
01:48:26,529 --> 01:48:27,249
[SPEAKER_11]: Then we assume yes.

1109
01:48:27,950 --> 01:48:29,051
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1110
01:48:30,933 --> 01:48:31,113
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

1111
01:48:31,475 --> 01:48:33,056
[SPEAKER_03]: We have neither been denied nor approved.

1112
01:48:33,396 --> 01:48:36,097
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, just because the microphone wasn't picking you up.

1113
01:48:36,677 --> 01:48:41,579
[SPEAKER_11]: The reason I ask is because I heard some things just weren't happening, just weren't manifesting.

1114
01:48:42,199 --> 01:48:44,380
[SPEAKER_11]: Like people were expecting to get them and they just wouldn't come.

1115
01:48:44,400 --> 01:48:48,641
[SPEAKER_09]: My understanding is that nobody in this community got that grant.

1116
01:48:49,042 --> 01:48:50,202
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, nobody got it.

1117
01:48:50,402 --> 01:48:50,622
[SPEAKER_09]: Correct.

1118
01:48:51,102 --> 01:48:52,263
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, so it never happened.

1119
01:48:52,283 --> 01:48:55,644
[SPEAKER_09]: No, nobody was approved for the EBA grant.

1120
01:48:55,924 --> 01:49:00,126
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I thought that was why we were doing the... That is exactly why we were doing it.

1121
01:49:00,166 --> 01:49:01,086
[SPEAKER_11]: And now we're doing it anyway.

1122
01:49:01,388 --> 01:49:01,669
[SPEAKER_07]: correct.

1123
01:49:02,011 --> 01:49:04,481
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, but you know what, but we're doing it.

1124
01:49:05,077 --> 01:49:21,129
[SPEAKER_07]: We're doing it and our strategies just was tweaked a little bit really, because instead of a gigantic grant that we can do all at once, now we have a 75% loan, 25% grant from the MWRA, which we are executing currently.

1125
01:49:21,309 --> 01:49:21,589
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

1126
01:49:21,750 --> 01:49:32,758
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're getting the ball rolling, we're hoping, and we're gonna need some additional funding, whether it's state revolving fund through DEP or an EPA grant, it's gonna have to be something.

1127
01:49:33,218 --> 01:49:34,218
[SPEAKER_11]: It needed to happen.

1128
01:49:34,238 --> 01:49:35,699
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm glad it's happening.

1129
01:49:35,719 --> 01:49:41,641
[SPEAKER_11]: Unfortunately, you know, whatever's happening with that is unfortunate.

1130
01:49:41,761 --> 01:49:44,382
[SPEAKER_11]: But I am happy that it's moving forward.

1131
01:49:44,762 --> 01:49:45,743
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever got us here.

1132
01:49:46,563 --> 01:49:49,324
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, you know, it's in the past in the past.

1133
01:49:49,384 --> 01:49:51,845
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, we can only move forward.

1134
01:49:51,865 --> 01:49:51,845
2032.

1135
01:49:52,005 --> 01:49:53,465
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the goal all the way out.

1136
01:49:53,685 --> 01:49:54,005
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.

1137
01:49:54,085 --> 01:50:00,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it possible that in a future federal administration, future Congress that maybe we could

1138
01:50:01,952 --> 01:50:03,273
[SPEAKER_03]: the grant might come back to life?

1139
01:50:03,493 --> 01:50:04,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that something you're thinking about?

1140
01:50:05,214 --> 01:50:08,596
[SPEAKER_09]: It might, but we're moving forward.

1141
01:50:08,616 --> 01:50:09,516
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not going to wait around.

1142
01:50:09,576 --> 01:50:10,957
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to get the lead out.

1143
01:50:11,177 --> 01:50:12,858
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's the process we're doing.

1144
01:50:12,958 --> 01:50:24,264
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's so we can always the first, as Tim mentioned before, the first year, it's going to be, you know, X amount of lead, then we're going to be like doing more and more the third year, then more and more.

1145
01:50:24,564 --> 01:50:29,086
[SPEAKER_09]: We can always ramp up, but it's just getting that ball rolling and getting going.

1146
01:50:29,246 --> 01:50:30,467
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what we're trying to do.

1147
01:50:30,802 --> 01:50:32,024
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and we have a very good partner.

1148
01:50:32,064 --> 01:50:35,288
[SPEAKER_07]: The MWRA is a very good partner in this effort.

1149
01:50:35,408 --> 01:50:36,589
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a huge stake in it.

1150
01:50:37,550 --> 01:50:39,232
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you tell us what that stands for?

1151
01:50:39,573 --> 01:50:41,235
[SPEAKER_07]: Massachusetts Water Resources Authority.

1152
01:50:41,515 --> 01:50:44,899
[SPEAKER_07]: They provide the water for this side of Massachusetts, more or less.

1153
01:50:45,740 --> 01:50:48,584
[SPEAKER_07]: And we are a retailer of their water.

1154
01:50:49,480 --> 01:50:53,362
[SPEAKER_03]: And the tune of $22 million or so the tune of $22 million.

1155
01:50:53,402 --> 01:50:54,102
[SPEAKER_07]: That's correct.

1156
01:50:54,243 --> 01:50:56,164
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, that's our biggest buy for sure.

1157
01:50:57,404 --> 01:51:03,167
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, they're working with the state at the state level on funding as well.

1158
01:51:03,307 --> 01:51:11,571
[SPEAKER_07]: That may include federal funding at the state level when it before it eventually comes to us, but we're hoping that you know, it comes to us.

1159
01:51:11,611 --> 01:51:13,552
[SPEAKER_07]: So when I say they have a stake in it.

1160
01:51:15,295 --> 01:51:19,309
[SPEAKER_07]: Medford has a relatively large amount of lead and unknowns in the ground.

1161
01:51:19,854 --> 01:51:23,457
[SPEAKER_07]: So that impacts how they treat their water.

1162
01:51:23,857 --> 01:51:38,169
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we don't get all the lead out by 2032, and it's not just Medford, but if all the lead doesn't get out to a certain level, then the MWRA has to add a treatment process to their process, which will impact all of their water users.

1163
01:51:38,509 --> 01:51:42,072
[SPEAKER_07]: And that obviously goes on the backs of the rate payers at some point.

1164
01:51:42,812 --> 01:51:47,296
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're working with them in partnership to try to make that 2032 goal.

1165
01:51:48,842 --> 01:51:49,002
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

1166
01:51:49,862 --> 01:51:50,162
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1167
01:51:50,582 --> 01:51:50,783
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

1168
01:51:50,823 --> 01:51:51,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1169
01:51:52,923 --> 01:51:56,184
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think I'll be a little more critical.

1170
01:51:56,404 --> 01:52:01,085
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that what we're seeing right now is my first question is staffing.

1171
01:52:01,566 --> 01:52:05,787
[SPEAKER_08]: I know we glossed over it, and I know that the mayor presents the budget and you have to live with it, correct?

1172
01:52:06,347 --> 01:52:10,008
[SPEAKER_08]: But how drastically understaffed are we?

1173
01:52:11,185 --> 01:52:19,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we have, we're understaffed in those three, so highway, fleet, and water and engineering.

1174
01:52:19,632 --> 01:52:28,499
[SPEAKER_07]: So, and fleet is part of highway really, but we have, you know, the superintendent, the foreman, and one mechanic operating right now.

1175
01:52:28,819 --> 01:52:32,122
[SPEAKER_07]: So we are significantly understaffed in fleet.

1176
01:52:32,976 --> 01:52:39,361
[SPEAKER_07]: Highway, we're trying to, I'm calling it understaffed, but we're trying to get three new hires on board.

1177
01:52:40,181 --> 01:52:42,163
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're interviewing some folks, we've got some candidates.

1178
01:52:42,883 --> 01:52:45,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Engineers are tough though, I will tell you, as well as water operators.

1179
01:52:46,286 --> 01:52:50,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Both of those markets are terrible for hiring right now.

1180
01:52:51,990 --> 01:52:59,435
[SPEAKER_08]: I can directly feel what you're saying because I work in that community that you mentioned, but that community also has

1181
01:53:00,978 --> 01:53:02,739
[SPEAKER_08]: an infrastructure of 10 people.

1182
01:53:03,259 --> 01:53:05,100
[SPEAKER_08]: We have Mr. Baker who's by himself.

1183
01:53:05,160 --> 01:53:09,802
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, the other day I saw him walk in the street checking a water leak.

1184
01:53:10,482 --> 01:53:15,364
[SPEAKER_08]: And I said, what is our number one person walking the streets?

1185
01:53:15,864 --> 01:53:16,985
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what I find amazing.

1186
01:53:17,025 --> 01:53:18,466
[SPEAKER_08]: I said, this is like counterproductive.

1187
01:53:19,546 --> 01:53:24,408
[SPEAKER_08]: We have to look at really putting together a plan in place that's a little bit more robust.

1188
01:53:24,488 --> 01:53:28,310
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm not saying you, I'm saying as a partnership, the council,

1189
01:53:28,971 --> 01:53:31,855
[SPEAKER_08]: the department, the mayor's office, to see what we can do.

1190
01:53:31,915 --> 01:53:40,506
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I look at the parks department and Somerville has one baseball field, they have four soccer fields, they have two softball fields.

1191
01:53:41,227 --> 01:53:45,052
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a crew of three that just lined fields in Molons, three.

1192
01:53:45,832 --> 01:53:48,033
[SPEAKER_07]: not including six, six people, right?

1193
01:53:48,053 --> 01:53:49,034
[SPEAKER_07]: You have eight altogether.

1194
01:53:49,054 --> 01:53:49,214
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1195
01:53:49,254 --> 01:53:49,734
[SPEAKER_07]: Eight altogether.

1196
01:53:49,774 --> 01:53:49,954
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

1197
01:53:50,114 --> 01:53:55,117
[SPEAKER_08]: And neighboring communities, they have like 12 to 15 with, with quarter of what we have in Medford.

1198
01:53:55,477 --> 01:53:55,698
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

1199
01:53:55,798 --> 01:54:01,521
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that it's, it's, it's something that has to be said and identified, not just glossed over.

1200
01:54:01,561 --> 01:54:13,527
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that we have to understand what we're seeing right now is a serious issue and concern of, you know, the override, you brought it up, you know, we had $500,000 and mocked back from the beginning of July one.

1201
01:54:13,547 --> 01:54:13,587
[SPEAKER_08]: So,

1202
01:54:15,158 --> 01:54:16,479
[SPEAKER_08]: Did we hire those three people?

1203
01:54:16,499 --> 01:54:17,360
[SPEAKER_08]: Are they new people?

1204
01:54:17,380 --> 01:54:18,521
[SPEAKER_08]: Are we just moving people in?

1205
01:54:19,061 --> 01:54:20,802
[SPEAKER_08]: Did we purchase the equipment?

1206
01:54:21,243 --> 01:54:25,626
[SPEAKER_08]: Because the mayor said that's gonna fix no more potholes, no more sidewalks.

1207
01:54:25,706 --> 01:54:27,628
[SPEAKER_08]: The sidewalk problems are all set.

1208
01:54:28,528 --> 01:54:33,752
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're anticipating, because the 20% increase in workforce, we're anticipating a 20% increase in productivity.

1209
01:54:33,853 --> 01:54:35,094
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's my expectations.

1210
01:54:35,374 --> 01:54:39,577
[SPEAKER_07]: We haven't hired new people on yet because we actually just finished the internal promotions and movements.

1211
01:54:40,217 --> 01:54:41,759
[SPEAKER_07]: Those jobs are posted.

1212
01:54:42,579 --> 01:54:46,481
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's a strategy in place that the mayor is working with me on.

1213
01:54:46,901 --> 01:54:53,304
[SPEAKER_07]: It started with forestry in my first year, I identified that forestry needed to be bigger, so we doubled the size of forestry.

1214
01:54:53,964 --> 01:54:58,086
[SPEAKER_07]: Water happened next, and I sat with the mayor and we came up with a strategy for water.

1215
01:54:58,686 --> 01:55:00,287
[SPEAKER_07]: Water happened in 2024-23 I feel like.

1216
01:55:02,368 --> 01:55:02,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.

1217
01:55:03,209 --> 01:55:09,154
[SPEAKER_07]: So, that has what are what has a lot of open positions right now me oh threes supervisor superintendent.

1218
01:55:09,574 --> 01:55:12,616
[SPEAKER_07]: So the open positions are there we're just going to film, Ron.

1219
01:55:13,477 --> 01:55:17,921
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry Mr Baker is the meter technician, he does have an assistant.

1220
01:55:18,881 --> 01:55:23,704
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're trying to get another assistant in there as part of the strategy.

1221
01:55:23,724 --> 01:55:27,507
[SPEAKER_07]: You know if we can if we can work that I don't disagree.

1222
01:55:27,907 --> 01:55:30,949
[SPEAKER_07]: As far as right sizing other divisions go for example parks.

1223
01:55:31,409 --> 01:55:34,531
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not quite there yet highway we can do some more.

1224
01:55:35,652 --> 01:55:37,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, so cemetery is right size.

1225
01:55:37,813 --> 01:55:39,214
[SPEAKER_07]: So I do have some good things to report.

1226
01:55:39,234 --> 01:55:42,635
[SPEAKER_07]: We actually moved a person from cemetery to highway because they're right size.

1227
01:55:43,635 --> 01:55:44,336
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's good.

1228
01:55:45,176 --> 01:55:47,577
[SPEAKER_07]: And how big should water be?

1229
01:55:47,637 --> 01:55:48,918
[SPEAKER_07]: How big should parks be?

1230
01:55:49,198 --> 01:55:50,478
[SPEAKER_07]: How big should forestry be?

1231
01:55:51,199 --> 01:55:52,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are very good questions.

1232
01:55:52,479 --> 01:56:01,243
[SPEAKER_07]: So I do spend time researching what other municipalities have, what they do, what the APWA recommends, what best practices are.

1233
01:56:01,823 --> 01:56:03,184
[SPEAKER_07]: And we do fall short

1234
01:56:03,877 --> 01:56:12,944
[SPEAKER_07]: for some of our divisions and we have for a very long time, and I'm pretty sure I've talked about that quite a bit, but both this Council and the executive.

1235
01:56:12,984 --> 01:56:16,066
[SPEAKER_08]: So back to the override question with your crew that was presented.

1236
01:56:16,586 --> 01:56:23,952
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a hot top sidewalk crew of three people plus, plus the equipment that's needed the truck.

1237
01:56:24,474 --> 01:56:24,614
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

1238
01:56:24,854 --> 01:56:33,476
[SPEAKER_08]: Where are we with those three people in the truck that was presented as an override fix all for us for hot top potholes inside?

1239
01:56:33,596 --> 01:56:33,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

1240
01:56:33,956 --> 01:56:36,777
[SPEAKER_07]: I've always presented as a 20 percent increase in highways productivity.

1241
01:56:36,797 --> 01:56:40,318
[SPEAKER_07]: So that means an increase and a focus on roadways and larger patches.

1242
01:56:40,758 --> 01:56:41,818
[SPEAKER_07]: So not just potholes.

1243
01:56:42,678 --> 01:56:44,979
[SPEAKER_07]: Potholes are definitely something that we have to keep up with.

1244
01:56:45,279 --> 01:56:49,980
[SPEAKER_07]: But removing large areas of potholes that need to be fixed, for example, and we keep returning to.

1245
01:56:50,280 --> 01:56:51,740
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have the equipment.

1246
01:56:51,960 --> 01:56:53,901
[SPEAKER_07]: The equipment includes a

1247
01:56:54,961 --> 01:57:08,291
[SPEAKER_07]: a specialized grinder with an asphalt spreader, a concrete planer, and then we have a dump truck that we're trying to make sure works with the paver that is working out pretty good.

1248
01:57:09,171 --> 01:57:10,652
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think we're on track.

1249
01:57:10,873 --> 01:57:18,958
[SPEAKER_07]: It did take a while to kind of do the internal movements of personnel to get to a place where we could turn the three new positions outside.

1250
01:57:19,619 --> 01:57:21,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are required by the union contract?

1251
01:57:22,482 --> 01:57:23,163
[SPEAKER_03]: internal movements.

1252
01:57:23,443 --> 01:57:23,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.

1253
01:57:23,763 --> 01:57:23,964
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1254
01:57:24,024 --> 01:57:26,666
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had to follow the contracts to move.

1255
01:57:27,327 --> 01:57:30,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, people had the positions had to be available to people already working for your department.

1256
01:57:31,010 --> 01:57:36,135
[SPEAKER_03]: And now that all of that is complete, what remains open is now available for the public to apply for.

1257
01:57:36,255 --> 01:57:36,616
[SPEAKER_07]: You got it.

1258
01:57:36,636 --> 01:57:37,617
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what we're doing right now.

1259
01:57:37,697 --> 01:57:39,599
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you just wanted to clarify.

1260
01:57:39,699 --> 01:57:42,842
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, to that point, yes, the perception that

1261
01:57:43,662 --> 01:57:53,010
[SPEAKER_08]: We have the equipment, the grinder per se, is a staff finally is it are they trained the staff that you need staff like council business, they're trained and ready to go we have that equipment.

1262
01:57:53,591 --> 01:57:54,932
[SPEAKER_07]: We have the equipment and we're doing trainings.

1263
01:57:55,152 --> 01:57:55,292
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1264
01:57:55,392 --> 01:57:58,034
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so, but this is this, how long we have that equipment.

1265
01:57:58,395 --> 01:57:59,135
[SPEAKER_08]: When do we.

1266
01:57:59,916 --> 01:58:06,442
[SPEAKER_07]: We got the equipment actually, I think, maybe a year ago, about a year ago, before the override so.

1267
01:58:07,937 --> 01:58:15,459
[SPEAKER_08]: This is what the confusion is where perceptions, not the reality, because what was said and what was led, this is what I'm trying to, people want questions.

1268
01:58:15,479 --> 01:58:17,780
[SPEAKER_08]: They're saying potholes are still not being filled.

1269
01:58:17,960 --> 01:58:19,020
[SPEAKER_08]: Sidewalks is still a mess.

1270
01:58:19,040 --> 01:58:20,101
[SPEAKER_08]: There's still questions, right?

1271
01:58:20,621 --> 01:58:28,303
[SPEAKER_08]: But the override, this is a story, and I'm not blaming you, I'm just sharing what has been presented to me when it comes to this budget.

1272
01:58:28,343 --> 01:58:30,003
[SPEAKER_08]: This $500,000 is gonna fix this.

1273
01:58:30,043 --> 01:58:32,384
[SPEAKER_08]: That was quote unquote, she said, it's gonna fix it.

1274
01:58:32,744 --> 01:58:34,945
[SPEAKER_08]: Now what we're saying is,

1275
01:58:36,025 --> 01:58:43,266
[SPEAKER_08]: the structure of understanding that, oh, this is just gonna be internal taking 20% of what we have and moving people to right positions.

1276
01:58:43,526 --> 01:58:44,146
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that's incorrect.

1277
01:58:44,166 --> 01:58:44,446
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no.

1278
01:58:44,486 --> 01:58:47,207
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have to, we added three new positions.

1279
01:58:47,467 --> 01:58:47,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1280
01:58:48,047 --> 01:58:50,948
[SPEAKER_07]: So we increased how many people are in highway by about 20%.

1281
01:58:51,068 --> 01:58:51,508
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1282
01:58:52,808 --> 01:58:59,089
[SPEAKER_07]: So in order to fill those positions, we have to promote people that are internal into those positions.

1283
01:58:59,649 --> 01:59:05,330
[SPEAKER_07]: So that took, I don't know, half a dozen or so internal movements of positions, people to positions.

1284
01:59:05,710 --> 01:59:07,272
[SPEAKER_07]: So that process is now done.

1285
01:59:07,713 --> 01:59:14,842
[SPEAKER_07]: And now we're looking to hire three brand new people that have never worked with the DPW before and bring them in, because we haven't got those new people yet.

1286
01:59:15,162 --> 01:59:19,007
[SPEAKER_07]: So we haven't been able to put out two puddle crews yet.

1287
01:59:19,347 --> 01:59:20,288
[SPEAKER_07]: But we're getting there.

1288
01:59:20,308 --> 01:59:23,472
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't think I don't think I've ever said that this is going to fix it.

1289
01:59:24,133 --> 01:59:24,594
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't say you

1290
01:59:24,834 --> 01:59:27,815
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't say, but I've never presented it that way either.

1291
01:59:28,175 --> 01:59:31,556
[SPEAKER_07]: I've always been presenting this as an increase in productivity.

1292
01:59:31,877 --> 01:59:33,617
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's also I've also been very clear.

1293
01:59:33,737 --> 01:59:34,918
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a piece of the puzzle.

1294
01:59:35,158 --> 01:59:40,300
[SPEAKER_07]: It's in-house work to do more cost effective spot repair work.

1295
01:59:40,660 --> 01:59:43,841
[SPEAKER_07]: But then the capital work needs to be production work.

1296
01:59:43,881 --> 01:59:46,562
[SPEAKER_07]: So longer stretches of asphalt, longer stretches of sidewalk.

1297
01:59:46,942 --> 01:59:53,228
[SPEAKER_07]: So those are the two components of improving our pavement condition index and our sidewalk condition index.

1298
01:59:53,929 --> 01:59:56,972
[SPEAKER_07]: So those are the two strategies that we are moving forward with.

1299
01:59:57,433 --> 01:59:59,675
[SPEAKER_07]: So both capital and in house capacity.

1300
01:59:59,875 --> 02:00:02,157
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so just so you share with where we're getting at.

1301
02:00:02,438 --> 02:00:02,658
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

1302
02:00:02,718 --> 02:00:06,642
[SPEAKER_08]: The perception of residents that said when you go through Somerville, you go through Cambridge,

1303
02:00:07,288 --> 02:00:09,910
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a hot top truck, right, there's a there's a crew out there.

1304
02:00:10,010 --> 02:00:13,313
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, we have to that they're they're doing that on a regular basis.

1305
02:00:13,373 --> 02:00:20,659
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not doing the hot top three to four days, they're replacing the sidewalks that so and these are the questions that people want to know where that's going.

1306
02:00:20,679 --> 02:00:21,960
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's that that's where it comes from.

1307
02:00:21,980 --> 02:00:28,845
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we do that to just reassure everybody out there we do we have a fairly large city there's 100 or so miles of road more than that.

1308
02:00:29,506 --> 02:00:30,166
[SPEAKER_07]: So when

1309
02:00:31,027 --> 02:00:33,669
[SPEAKER_07]: When you don't see pothole crews out there, it doesn't mean they're not out there.

1310
02:00:33,929 --> 02:00:34,790
[SPEAKER_07]: They are out there.

1311
02:00:34,830 --> 02:00:37,192
[SPEAKER_07]: We're out there three to four days a week a lot of the times.

1312
02:00:38,433 --> 02:00:41,896
[SPEAKER_07]: And I personally can't wait until we see that increase in production.

1313
02:00:41,956 --> 02:00:46,820
[SPEAKER_07]: It's one of my major goals here at the city of Medford because I feel the same as everybody else.

1314
02:00:46,900 --> 02:00:47,380
[SPEAKER_07]: I live here too.

1315
02:00:47,641 --> 02:00:48,341
[SPEAKER_07]: There's too many potholes.

1316
02:00:48,802 --> 02:00:50,583
[SPEAKER_07]: The roads have been neglected for far too long.

1317
02:00:50,843 --> 02:00:53,005
[SPEAKER_07]: The water pipes have been neglected for far too long.

1318
02:00:53,045 --> 02:00:58,630
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of the reasons I am where I am is because I would like to use my skills to fix that.

1319
02:00:58,830 --> 02:00:59,510
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate that.

1320
02:00:59,530 --> 02:01:00,051
[SPEAKER_08]: Because again,

1321
02:01:00,735 --> 02:01:19,396
[SPEAKER_08]: Your team, you guys are doing a great job yeoman's where you can set into consideration what we're seeing here right yeah so I mean what we have in comparison with other communities and what we have to fix is a lot so I appreciate that that's not the question I think that just understanding as we go through the budget so we can answer some questions the other piece that you brought up earlier.

1322
02:01:20,040 --> 02:01:22,622
[SPEAKER_08]: was now the confusion where it's coming in.

1323
02:01:22,662 --> 02:01:25,805
[SPEAKER_08]: I know we talked about it ourselves is the private public way.

1324
02:01:25,905 --> 02:01:29,507
[SPEAKER_08]: So now I know we talked about what we can and what we can't do.

1325
02:01:29,567 --> 02:01:33,090
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we need to really have a true outline.

1326
02:01:33,490 --> 02:01:43,418
[SPEAKER_08]: So our residents understand, because I think there's a lot, there's a lot of confusion when I'm getting phone calls saying, George, I have an, I have an issue on my street, but I was told I cannot, they cannot touch it because I'm a private way.

1327
02:01:43,879 --> 02:01:44,679
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'll give you an example.

1328
02:01:44,719 --> 02:01:49,283
[SPEAKER_08]: We're talking about one neighborhood who hot top this street on their own, this, the private way,

1329
02:01:50,010 --> 02:01:52,482
[SPEAKER_08]: The community on that street paid for the hot tub.

1330
02:01:53,230 --> 02:01:58,231
[SPEAKER_08]: There's been some issues where the streets have been dug up, plows have gone through, taken up potholes.

1331
02:01:58,631 --> 02:02:01,072
[SPEAKER_08]: But then the question is, why isn't that being fixed?

1332
02:02:01,552 --> 02:02:02,972
[SPEAKER_08]: So these are the confusion things.

1333
02:02:02,992 --> 02:02:05,013
[SPEAKER_08]: And listen, Tim, you've been very reactive.

1334
02:02:05,033 --> 02:02:09,054
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate how creative you tried to be, and I know it's difficult.

1335
02:02:09,574 --> 02:02:15,235
[SPEAKER_08]: But when we have residents calling and they're saying, the confusion comes in, and I'm a city councilor, and I'm confused.

1336
02:02:15,775 --> 02:02:21,877
[SPEAKER_08]: Because when you look at it, it does sound reasonable when it says, well, we did pay for that private way.

1337
02:02:23,065 --> 02:02:26,707
[SPEAKER_08]: the city did come in and somehow it was a main issue.

1338
02:02:26,727 --> 02:02:29,229
[SPEAKER_08]: So the water department came in and fix something there.

1339
02:02:29,269 --> 02:02:30,369
[SPEAKER_08]: So they dug up that road.

1340
02:02:30,789 --> 02:02:30,990
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

1341
02:02:31,210 --> 02:02:35,152
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever happened after that, when the plow started coming in, started tearing up that road.

1342
02:02:36,012 --> 02:02:37,373
[SPEAKER_08]: So they've already fixed it.

1343
02:02:38,014 --> 02:02:43,737
[SPEAKER_08]: So now where do we stand as a city when it comes to private ways to correct issues that we're part of?

1344
02:02:45,269 --> 02:02:51,174
[SPEAKER_07]: Well if we damage something in a private way we are responsible to fix it and we have a list of like berms that we've taken out with plows and things like that.

1345
02:02:52,094 --> 02:02:56,398
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, because we've talked about a limited amount of funds that we have.

1346
02:02:57,098 --> 02:03:08,787
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm really really aware of every dollar that I can get going to the public, the roads ones that by law we are responsible for and the city taxpayers responsible for.

1347
02:03:10,375 --> 02:03:15,381
[SPEAKER_07]: A document or a web page that describes what a private way is versus public way.

1348
02:03:16,642 --> 02:03:26,353
[SPEAKER_07]: There, you know, there are resources, resources out there we haven't put one together except for for parking we do have a resources for private ways and parking, so that's out there folks want to see it.

1349
02:03:26,734 --> 02:03:29,157
[SPEAKER_07]: As far as who's responsible for exactly what.

1350
02:03:29,657 --> 02:03:30,437
[SPEAKER_07]: in a private way.

1351
02:03:31,198 --> 02:03:32,178
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not always clear.

1352
02:03:32,458 --> 02:03:32,738
[SPEAKER_07]: It isn't.

1353
02:03:33,159 --> 02:03:34,099
[SPEAKER_07]: It has to do with title.

1354
02:03:34,839 --> 02:03:39,942
[SPEAKER_07]: It has to do with whether or not there's a homeowner's association, whether or not there's derelict fee involved.

1355
02:03:40,042 --> 02:03:42,223
[SPEAKER_07]: There's so many factors involved.

1356
02:03:42,803 --> 02:03:47,005
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little bit of a legal gray area, almost all of it.

1357
02:03:48,166 --> 02:03:52,027
[SPEAKER_07]: So what now that we have a city solicitor on board, I haven't talked to him about it yet.

1358
02:03:52,087 --> 02:03:53,108
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know,

1359
02:03:53,788 --> 02:03:59,873
[SPEAKER_07]: I had talked about with a previous city solicitor quite a while ago about putting together some resource.

1360
02:04:00,073 --> 02:04:00,553
[SPEAKER_07]: That'd be great.

1361
02:04:00,853 --> 02:04:01,094
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1362
02:04:01,394 --> 02:04:13,443
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think until that happens, I direct folks to Massachusetts, the Commonwealth's website that has tons of information about the difference between public and private ways.

1363
02:04:14,724 --> 02:04:19,447
[SPEAKER_07]: And if any questions arise out of that, Owen and I are happy to answer questions.

1364
02:04:19,928 --> 02:04:22,890
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of people wonder how to make a private way into a public way.

1365
02:04:23,230 --> 02:04:26,152
[SPEAKER_07]: We know how we can we can talk about that.

1366
02:04:26,672 --> 02:04:41,819
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I have a very good idea, just based off of working here and working as an engineer have to do with land rights and who can do what and who has what rights to do what it can be a legal tangle.

1367
02:04:42,960 --> 02:04:48,663
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just want to make sure that everybody understands that the public tax dollars are for

1368
02:04:49,203 --> 02:04:54,952
[SPEAKER_07]: public rights of way which is why the process of public way acceptance exists to begin with.

1369
02:04:55,733 --> 02:04:57,656
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's just very important for people to know.

1370
02:04:58,236 --> 02:05:04,045
[SPEAKER_08]: So, so I know that and I appreciate that I think that I know people don't understand that the funding we get.

1371
02:05:04,775 --> 02:05:08,416
[SPEAKER_08]: that we don't get because a lot of our roads are private hurt us.

1372
02:05:08,516 --> 02:05:20,478
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's something maybe we should, as a council, as an administration, work together, try to find a way, how can we make more of our private ways, public ways to help us fund these concerns?

1373
02:05:20,518 --> 02:05:21,758
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's a big issue.

1374
02:05:21,958 --> 02:05:27,139
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I know we're spending a lot of time on these private ways because of situations like we've talked about.

1375
02:05:27,479 --> 02:05:30,600
[SPEAKER_08]: And I appreciate you picking up that phone because I know sometimes you see my phone ring.

1376
02:05:31,121 --> 02:05:44,223
[SPEAKER_07]: And nine out of 10 times about a private way so that's okay let me everyone you're not the only counselor does that and I think that the more questions that are answered when it comes to private ways the better in Medford because I think we had a lot of time here in the city.

1377
02:05:44,664 --> 02:05:48,145
[SPEAKER_07]: where private ways were treated like public ways.

1378
02:05:49,086 --> 02:05:51,406
[SPEAKER_07]: We do provide limited services on private ways.

1379
02:05:51,727 --> 02:05:57,169
[SPEAKER_07]: And we can talk about that more in the future because we probably have to clear something up legally.

1380
02:05:57,249 --> 02:06:01,650
[SPEAKER_07]: But we do plow the private ways and we do fill potholes in private ways.

1381
02:06:02,150 --> 02:06:08,933
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've actually recently been involved with trying to discuss private way conditions with the private way owners.

1382
02:06:09,567 --> 02:06:13,750
[SPEAKER_07]: There are savvy folks out there, they understand what the rules are.

1383
02:06:15,151 --> 02:06:22,257
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, talking with those people, there's an interest in a knowledge base growing out in Medford.

1384
02:06:23,078 --> 02:06:25,700
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think a resource like you suggest would only help that.

1385
02:06:25,820 --> 02:06:29,242
[SPEAKER_07]: So like I said, now that Mr. Foley is on board, maybe we can put something together.

1386
02:06:29,262 --> 02:06:32,205
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, last is something that I think that

1387
02:06:33,138 --> 02:06:49,436
[SPEAKER_08]: We've all talked about, we've had the President of the Union here, I mean the representatives from Teamstiz, it seems like it's DPW is seeing a lot of grievances and then appeals and arbitrations and

1388
02:06:50,435 --> 02:06:52,677
[SPEAKER_08]: How's that working with the morale of the team?

1389
02:06:52,737 --> 02:06:54,939
[SPEAKER_08]: I know it's not, it must be difficult.

1390
02:06:55,319 --> 02:07:07,548
[SPEAKER_08]: My biggest thing is morale, first of all, second of all, is most important that we're seeing for the community is the money that we're spending with, let's say there's a situation where someone bids for a job.

1391
02:07:09,089 --> 02:07:12,692
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't think, the city doesn't think they get the job, so now you go through the whole process, right?

1392
02:07:13,133 --> 02:07:17,456
[SPEAKER_08]: It goes to arbitration, the arbitrator says, okay, we support this employee.

1393
02:07:18,523 --> 02:07:20,505
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, normally that would stop and we move forward.

1394
02:07:21,245 --> 02:07:23,908
[SPEAKER_08]: Now we're seeing situations where, what, we're going to appeal it now.

1395
02:07:24,468 --> 02:07:27,311
[SPEAKER_08]: How does that, how does the morale there hurt?

1396
02:07:27,691 --> 02:07:40,923
[SPEAKER_08]: And then how is it affecting the whole budget process when we're A, leaving positions open, and then B, keep fighting these issues when it comes to arbitration cases, which cost money.

1397
02:07:41,648 --> 02:07:49,557
[SPEAKER_08]: So is that coming out of your budget when it's when it's coming a legal issue when it comes arbitrations and stuff.

1398
02:07:50,218 --> 02:07:54,763
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we do have, we do pay some legal bills out of the DBW budget.

1399
02:07:54,903 --> 02:07:58,207
[SPEAKER_07]: It is in there that have to do with DBW employees.

1400
02:07:58,667 --> 02:08:02,432
[SPEAKER_07]: So you know those those legal matters that I'm not

1401
02:08:03,486 --> 02:08:07,590
[SPEAKER_07]: know, prepared to talk about today as far as personnel and the legal matters.

1402
02:08:07,810 --> 02:08:12,354
[SPEAKER_07]: I know but no I do want to get to your question about morale.

1403
02:08:12,414 --> 02:08:12,994
[SPEAKER_07]: It could be better.

1404
02:08:13,014 --> 02:08:14,295
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean it always could be better.

1405
02:08:14,596 --> 02:08:16,857
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's better in some divisions than others.

1406
02:08:17,898 --> 02:08:22,002
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's different multitude of reasons it's not just grievances.

1407
02:08:22,362 --> 02:08:25,184
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes it's, you know, things like I

1408
02:08:26,093 --> 02:08:31,557
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have enough colleagues in the mechanic shop, and it's really bumming me out because I'm doing too much overtime.

1409
02:08:32,138 --> 02:08:42,946
[SPEAKER_07]: Or, you know, maybe it's coming out of the engineering office when, you know, so and so, I saw that so and so is getting paid more than me over, you know, at this other place.

1410
02:08:43,046 --> 02:08:45,928
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, it's reminding them, you have benefits here too.

1411
02:08:45,988 --> 02:08:51,372
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, you know, there's different reasons, I think, besides just grievances from the union that are

1412
02:08:51,793 --> 02:08:58,648
[SPEAKER_07]: impacting morale, you know and I think a good chunk of it is the fact that we're.

1413
02:08:59,263 --> 02:09:13,768
[SPEAKER_07]: We're working out there with a whole bunch of open positions waters comes to mind because we have basically me and deputy deputy bring, and then we have multiple positions before we get to labor that are open supervisor and superintendent.

1414
02:09:14,228 --> 02:09:16,849
[SPEAKER_07]: So, that's not good for morale either.

1415
02:09:17,349 --> 02:09:21,831
[SPEAKER_07]: So you know this, like I said, the answer your question there are many many different things that impact morale.

1416
02:09:22,391 --> 02:09:31,256
[SPEAKER_07]: And just one more thing, I do try to do things that will increase morale, making sure that I'm recognizing folks who do great things.

1417
02:09:32,116 --> 02:09:37,839
[SPEAKER_07]: And even recognizing folks just coming to work every day and recognizing those good employees.

1418
02:09:38,439 --> 02:09:39,300
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a lot of them.

1419
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:47,044
[SPEAKER_07]: So I do my best to try to acknowledge them and make sure that we know that we value what they give to the city.

1420
02:09:48,104 --> 02:09:48,705
[SPEAKER_07]: Does it always work?

1421
02:09:48,725 --> 02:09:49,145
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1422
02:09:50,012 --> 02:09:50,532
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope it does.

1423
02:09:50,993 --> 02:09:54,534
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, I had some tough questions and I appreciate it.

1424
02:09:54,574 --> 02:09:57,835
[SPEAKER_08]: And here's the thing, Tim, you've always, you've always picked up the phone.

1425
02:09:58,335 --> 02:09:59,416
[SPEAKER_08]: You've always guided us.

1426
02:09:59,936 --> 02:10:05,018
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the team that you do have are doing a great job for the numbers that we do have.

1427
02:10:05,118 --> 02:10:17,223
[SPEAKER_08]: So I know there are issues with potholes and sidewalks on and so forth, but I think for what we have right now, and I think that, you know, that it's important that I appreciate you recognize that with your staff and you support them and,

1428
02:10:17,923 --> 02:10:20,025
[SPEAKER_08]: And I appreciate you sitting there and answering these questions.

1429
02:10:20,065 --> 02:10:29,753
[SPEAKER_08]: I know they're not, they weren't easy, but I know that, you know, for one counselor, if there's anything that DPW needs and be a champion for, we're here.

1430
02:10:29,794 --> 02:10:30,694
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm here for you.

1431
02:10:30,714 --> 02:10:31,195
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you.

1432
02:10:32,976 --> 02:10:33,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1433
02:10:34,822 --> 02:10:38,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Seeing no further questions from members of the council, just have one for you.

1434
02:10:38,543 --> 02:10:40,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Could you talk a little bit more about the trash contract?

1435
02:10:41,944 --> 02:10:44,945
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nearly 25% of the DPW budget.

1436
02:10:44,985 --> 02:10:48,186
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the vast majority of certainly the general fund side of the DPW budget.

1437
02:10:48,806 --> 02:10:50,026
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going up very fast.

1438
02:10:51,046 --> 02:10:51,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Could you talk about that?

1439
02:10:51,887 --> 02:11:00,229
[SPEAKER_03]: And then could you talk about why some of the renegotiated the new contract, for example, why we have a fee for bulk pickup now and some of the other changes?

1440
02:11:01,209 --> 02:11:04,030
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, I can talk about that specific change first if you want.

1441
02:11:04,070 --> 02:11:04,991
[SPEAKER_07]: So don't lose track of it.

1442
02:11:05,951 --> 02:11:10,253
[SPEAKER_07]: So before there was no fee everybody got a certain number I think was two free.

1443
02:11:11,333 --> 02:11:14,914
[SPEAKER_07]: So, folks didn't have skin in the game, so there was a lot of abuse of that.

1444
02:11:15,695 --> 02:11:26,039
[SPEAKER_07]: So one of that cost falls back on the city again so it's free for the residents but it costs the city more money, because things are, it's not done correctly people are, you know,

1445
02:11:26,879 --> 02:11:31,144
[SPEAKER_07]: putting putting things out there that maybe they shouldn't be or whatever those.

1446
02:11:31,965 --> 02:11:37,031
[SPEAKER_07]: So when folks don't have some sort of responsibility to pay for it.

1447
02:11:39,698 --> 02:11:49,901
[SPEAKER_07]: hold them accountable for the trash that they're putting out basically, we're not charging the full cost just half the cost might even be less than half so it's $15, so we felt that was a reasonable cost.

1448
02:11:50,921 --> 02:11:54,662
[SPEAKER_07]: As far as why it's a lot more as we had 10 year contracts, there was only.

1449
02:11:56,843 --> 02:11:59,626
[SPEAKER_07]: the escalation in the 10-year contract doesn't match inflation.

1450
02:12:00,267 --> 02:12:07,054
[SPEAKER_07]: So probably by the end of our 10-year contract with waste management, they probably were losing money.

1451
02:12:07,434 --> 02:12:10,197
[SPEAKER_07]: They weren't making as much as they were in the first years of the contract.

1452
02:12:10,677 --> 02:12:17,464
[SPEAKER_07]: So now we have a new contract, and the inflation and other escalations are represented in that new contract.

1453
02:12:17,705 --> 02:12:19,907
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's one big reason why it's more money.

1454
02:12:20,647 --> 02:12:23,069
[SPEAKER_07]: The other reason is because we're adding a service.

1455
02:12:23,109 --> 02:12:24,650
[SPEAKER_07]: We're adding composting service right now.

1456
02:12:25,050 --> 02:12:27,712
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's an additional cost as well.

1457
02:12:28,252 --> 02:12:30,434
[SPEAKER_07]: And that has to do with the cost of trash disposal.

1458
02:12:31,194 --> 02:12:35,377
[SPEAKER_07]: Trash disposal costs are going way up and they're going to continue to go way, way up.

1459
02:12:35,537 --> 02:12:37,459
[SPEAKER_03]: You mean trash as opposed to recycling?

1460
02:12:37,579 --> 02:12:37,919
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.

1461
02:12:38,419 --> 02:12:39,000
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, yes, yes.

1462
02:12:39,060 --> 02:12:40,601
[SPEAKER_07]: Trash, recycling and compost.

1463
02:12:40,681 --> 02:12:42,162
[SPEAKER_07]: So those are our three buckets.

1464
02:12:42,942 --> 02:12:47,084
[SPEAKER_07]: Trash is very, very expensive and will continue to get more expensive to dispose of.

1465
02:12:47,684 --> 02:12:49,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Recycling, there's a market for that.

1466
02:12:49,385 --> 02:12:53,026
[SPEAKER_07]: It goes up and down, the different products that are in the recycling.

1467
02:12:53,446 --> 02:12:54,227
[SPEAKER_07]: And then compost.

1468
02:12:54,627 --> 02:13:00,969
[SPEAKER_07]: Compost is the heavy, wet, smelly portion of your trash, basically.

1469
02:13:01,049 --> 02:13:07,332
[SPEAKER_07]: So removing that and composting it, turning it back into soil is the inexpensive, sustainable,

1470
02:13:07,752 --> 02:13:08,513
[SPEAKER_07]: way to go.

1471
02:13:08,853 --> 02:13:18,157
[SPEAKER_07]: So then we're only disposing of the lighter, easier to dispose of trash that doesn't stink up your garage or whatever.

1472
02:13:18,558 --> 02:13:20,359
[SPEAKER_07]: But it also reduces the weight.

1473
02:13:21,359 --> 02:13:21,919
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yes, yes.

1474
02:13:21,959 --> 02:13:23,720
[SPEAKER_07]: We pay by the ton, so it reduces the weight.

1475
02:13:23,840 --> 02:13:24,541
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, exactly.

1476
02:13:24,581 --> 02:13:31,004
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're disposing of and paying for less trash disposal and paying for more compost disposal.

1477
02:13:31,024 --> 02:13:32,065
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're tipping the scales.

1478
02:13:33,185 --> 02:13:34,546
[SPEAKER_07]: In the long run, the hope is that

1479
02:13:35,885 --> 02:13:38,646
[SPEAKER_03]: that might end up being more cost effective to go in that direction?

1480
02:13:38,666 --> 02:13:40,447
[SPEAKER_07]: We pretty much think it will be.

1481
02:13:40,527 --> 02:13:46,770
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of one of those things, if you look at landfills and how much space is left to put trash and bury it, we're running out.

1482
02:13:46,870 --> 02:13:49,711
[SPEAKER_07]: So we burn a lot of it now, and the ratio of burn is going up.

1483
02:13:50,072 --> 02:13:51,852
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're incinerating more and more trash.

1484
02:13:52,152 --> 02:13:54,494
[SPEAKER_07]: It's simple why, we're running out of room to put it in the landfill.

1485
02:13:55,754 --> 02:13:57,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, Councilor Collins.

1486
02:13:59,065 --> 02:13:59,345
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1487
02:13:59,525 --> 02:14:00,186
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for being here.

1488
02:14:00,226 --> 02:14:01,426
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for the presentation.

1489
02:14:01,927 --> 02:14:05,109
[SPEAKER_16]: I thought I wasn't going to ask any questions about the waste contract but who am I kidding.

1490
02:14:06,349 --> 02:14:12,553
[SPEAKER_16]: Just quickly, and I know we discussed this when I was on the Solid Waste Task Force a couple years ago when the new waste contract was being negotiated.

1491
02:14:12,573 --> 02:14:16,716
[SPEAKER_16]: I remember at that time, this was a couple years ago now, there was some discussion of

1492
02:14:17,897 --> 02:14:25,783
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, for municipalities like ours, there is potentially ways for to be reimbursed for the recycling of certain recyclables.

1493
02:14:25,843 --> 02:14:27,785
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that something that's come to fruition in this contract?

1494
02:14:27,845 --> 02:14:31,568
[SPEAKER_16]: And is that a negligible or non negligible number?

1495
02:14:31,928 --> 02:14:32,769
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not negligible.

1496
02:14:32,989 --> 02:14:33,529
[SPEAKER_07]: That's so

1497
02:14:34,710 --> 02:14:40,574
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the same as the previous contract, really, if there's a formula involved for the streams.

1498
02:14:40,814 --> 02:14:47,919
[SPEAKER_07]: So once the single stream is split up to cardboard, plastic and metal, we get market rates for those.

1499
02:14:48,279 --> 02:14:51,021
[SPEAKER_07]: So if cardboard is doing really well, which I think it is right now,

1500
02:14:51,585 --> 02:14:52,865
[SPEAKER_07]: We might get paid for cardboard.

1501
02:14:52,885 --> 02:14:54,286
[SPEAKER_07]: So weird.

1502
02:14:54,306 --> 02:14:55,326
[SPEAKER_07]: You see what I mean?

1503
02:14:55,586 --> 02:14:55,786
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1504
02:14:56,286 --> 02:14:56,786
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you saying it?

1505
02:14:56,826 --> 02:14:57,386
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it's not.

1506
02:14:57,466 --> 02:14:57,826
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1507
02:14:57,887 --> 02:14:58,127
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.

1508
02:14:58,307 --> 02:14:59,387
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I believe you.

1509
02:14:59,447 --> 02:15:01,107
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just weird that it is.

1510
02:15:01,147 --> 02:15:01,967
[SPEAKER_07]: Cardboard might be up.

1511
02:15:02,087 --> 02:15:04,488
[SPEAKER_07]: Aluminum was down for a long time.

1512
02:15:04,688 --> 02:15:06,128
[SPEAKER_07]: So aluminum was down for a long time.

1513
02:15:06,248 --> 02:15:09,769
[SPEAKER_07]: So no one was buying aluminum cans and recycling.

1514
02:15:09,809 --> 02:15:14,670
[SPEAKER_07]: So last couple of years have been tough for recycling, I will say.

1515
02:15:14,830 --> 02:15:15,331
[SPEAKER_07]: Last few years.

1516
02:15:16,391 --> 02:15:17,151
[SPEAKER_07]: In terms of the market?

1517
02:15:17,491 --> 02:15:18,831
[SPEAKER_07]: In terms of the market, yep.

1518
02:15:18,971 --> 02:15:21,292
[SPEAKER_07]: We're ending up paying for disposal.

1519
02:15:22,212 --> 02:15:27,636
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to the same places, but the market is such that we have to pay them to take it away.

1520
02:15:28,496 --> 02:15:28,956
[SPEAKER_16]: Interesting.

1521
02:15:29,116 --> 02:15:44,726
[SPEAKER_16]: It is so interesting to me that the solid waste contract and transacting for the city is maybe one of our clearest examples of how the city is impacted by the free market when there are other ways in which we are not able to participate in the free market ie capping of property taxes and a proposition two and a half but we are

1522
02:15:45,286 --> 02:15:49,469
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, now I think it's good that the waste contract is tied to cost of inflation.

1523
02:15:50,409 --> 02:15:58,094
[SPEAKER_16]: That seems fair for both parties, you know, in an equal system and our potential reimbursement subject to what different recyclables are being traded for.

1524
02:15:58,154 --> 02:16:05,579
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just, I think for residents, it's an interesting case study within a local economy where there's usually more of these artificial constraints.

1525
02:16:06,680 --> 02:16:11,363
[SPEAKER_16]: My other question also pertaining to the waste contract.

1526
02:16:12,383 --> 02:16:13,164
[SPEAKER_16]: I know part of the,

1527
02:16:14,044 --> 02:16:32,514
[SPEAKER_16]: One of the many great things about redoing the contract, renegotiating that, is that being able to factor in better recycling, opening ourselves up to better compost service was to make us eligible for more grants through the state because of our waste and recycling practices becoming more aligned with best practices.

1528
02:16:33,114 --> 02:16:38,057
[SPEAKER_16]: Are there any major grants that we have applied to or received in the past couple of years since the new contract started?

1529
02:16:38,813 --> 02:16:44,558
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, so DEP has a couple of grants and right now we're working on securing one of them.

1530
02:16:44,598 --> 02:16:45,559
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called pay as you throw.

1531
02:16:46,120 --> 02:16:46,940
[SPEAKER_07]: So you are correct.

1532
02:16:46,960 --> 02:16:53,886
[SPEAKER_07]: We are not eligible for that because we have incorporated compost and we have a multi-year strategy when it comes to solid waste.

1533
02:16:54,967 --> 02:16:56,909
[SPEAKER_07]: We're eligible for grants like that.

1534
02:16:57,029 --> 02:17:02,994
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, when it comes to buying new compost carts, for example, we need to buy those and there's lots of them.

1535
02:17:03,075 --> 02:17:05,557
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have to, we're looking for grants for that, for example.

1536
02:17:05,937 --> 02:17:13,836
[SPEAKER_16]: okay great thank you and then last thing really quickly i know there was kind of a tiered approach to rolling out uh free composting citywide through this contract when is the next

1537
02:17:14,422 --> 02:17:14,882
[SPEAKER_16]: expansion.

1538
02:17:14,902 --> 02:17:18,104
[SPEAKER_16]: I know we're kind of expanding in concentric circles for different types of residences.

1539
02:17:18,184 --> 02:17:19,465
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that a couple years down the pike?

1540
02:17:19,805 --> 02:17:22,707
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we're in between phases right now.

1541
02:17:23,248 --> 02:17:28,651
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're working with some folks at Tufts University to help us plan this out.

1542
02:17:29,331 --> 02:17:33,974
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's going to be a little bit of a ramp up coming soon here.

1543
02:17:34,034 --> 02:17:38,817
[SPEAKER_07]: We're reaching that difficult phase in the transition where most of the people who are

1544
02:17:40,153 --> 02:17:42,836
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, pretty easy to get onto the program happened already now.

1545
02:17:43,576 --> 02:17:47,340
[SPEAKER_07]: So now we're kind of climbing that steeper hill to get more people on board.

1546
02:17:47,760 --> 02:17:54,627
[SPEAKER_07]: They're coming on, but we have to have a certain rate to get every, you know, everybody in the city on board by a certain time.

1547
02:17:55,087 --> 02:17:55,268
[SPEAKER_07]: So.

1548
02:17:55,668 --> 02:17:56,869
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, great.

1549
02:17:57,189 --> 02:17:57,650
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much.

1550
02:17:57,670 --> 02:17:58,291
[SPEAKER_07]: You're welcome.

1551
02:17:59,071 --> 02:17:59,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1552
02:17:59,692 --> 02:18:05,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have any comments from councillors, questions from councillors or any comments from members of the public on the DPW budget?

1553
02:18:09,671 --> 02:18:12,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Seeing no one in the chamber and no hands raised on zoom.

1554
02:18:12,913 --> 02:18:15,074
[SPEAKER_03]: I thank you guys very much All right.

1555
02:18:15,114 --> 02:18:16,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you going to our public schools.

1556
02:18:16,455 --> 02:18:16,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Next.

1557
02:18:16,815 --> 02:18:19,817
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the superintendent and finance team with us

1558
02:18:21,995 --> 02:18:29,659
[SPEAKER_03]: And as folks know, Metro Public Schools is a little bit different than all of our other city departments because they are governed by the school committee.

1559
02:18:30,200 --> 02:18:35,042
[SPEAKER_03]: We, both the mayor and the city council do not have any line item authority over the school budget.

1560
02:18:35,062 --> 02:18:40,165
[SPEAKER_03]: We simply can, we provide the full general fund allocation.

1561
02:18:40,626 --> 02:18:45,488
[SPEAKER_03]: The mayor makes a proposal and the city council could approve or reduce or reject that proposal.

1562
02:18:46,049 --> 02:18:48,270
[SPEAKER_03]: And given that we do have a budget book

1563
02:18:49,610 --> 02:18:59,013
[SPEAKER_03]: The fiscal year 25 budget so the year ending next month June 30 was 83 million, and the proposed fiscal 26 budget is 87,583,290.

1564
02:18:59,674 --> 02:19:04,575
[SPEAKER_03]: And is that also the allocation proposed by the mayor.

1565
02:19:05,396 --> 02:19:06,496
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll double check that but.

1566
02:19:07,276 --> 02:19:11,818
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so that's the request from the school committee, have they voted on that yet.

1567
02:19:12,862 --> 02:19:16,043
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the voted request from the school committee for the general fund.

1568
02:19:16,703 --> 02:19:18,903
[SPEAKER_03]: With that, I'll turn it over to you, Madam Superintendent.

1569
02:19:20,224 --> 02:19:20,864
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

1570
02:19:21,664 --> 02:19:26,225
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seriously edited my opening remarks, because I know we're pressed for time.

1571
02:19:26,345 --> 02:19:39,268
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just am here to kind of like start the, I'm going to kick it over to Mr. Noel Velez and Mr. Jeremy Q, who have worked tirelessly on the budget, and I thank them very much.

1572
02:19:40,148 --> 02:19:43,772
[SPEAKER_01]: for their partnership and their dedication to this work.

1573
02:19:44,092 --> 02:19:47,395
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also just wanted to say thank you to all of you.

1574
02:19:47,596 --> 02:19:56,865
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you to the mayor and the school committee and the Medford community for the support, the ongoing and the continuous support for Medford Public Schools.

1575
02:19:57,665 --> 02:19:58,907
[SPEAKER_01]: It is greatly appreciated.

1576
02:19:58,987 --> 02:20:00,428
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes in this work,

1577
02:20:02,810 --> 02:20:12,795
[SPEAKER_01]: the needs of the district, the needs of the students, because we do work on behalf of students, can sometimes exceed what the available funding is.

1578
02:20:12,815 --> 02:20:17,617
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have adapted a little bit of our presentation due to the time constraints.

1579
02:20:18,037 --> 02:20:21,519
[SPEAKER_01]: You have the entire presentation, but I'm going to start sharing if

1580
02:20:22,359 --> 02:20:23,680
[SPEAKER_01]: You've allowed me as a co host.

1581
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:24,281
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

1582
02:20:24,981 --> 02:20:26,542
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to start sharing.

1583
02:20:27,603 --> 02:20:38,091
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're following along, halfway through on slide 13 so that Mr McHugh and Mr Velez can just get right down to the nitty gritty of your questions and why we're here.

1584
02:20:38,111 --> 02:20:39,852
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that seem reasonable.

1585
02:20:40,092 --> 02:20:40,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds great.

1586
02:20:40,713 --> 02:20:41,113
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, great.

1587
02:20:41,173 --> 02:20:41,554
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1588
02:20:41,574 --> 02:20:45,477
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there's been a very extensive many public meetings at the school committee that people can go.

1589
02:20:49,377 --> 02:20:50,277
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you all very much.

1590
02:20:50,558 --> 02:20:53,499
[SPEAKER_14]: My name is Norval S, Director of Finance of Medford Public Schools.

1591
02:20:55,240 --> 02:20:57,281
[SPEAKER_14]: And we'll just, once she puts the slide up.

1592
02:21:02,263 --> 02:21:09,207
[SPEAKER_14]: So what you're reading here is, as we were talking about a little bit earlier, the school committee approved the budget of $87,582,290.

1593
02:21:09,247 --> 02:21:10,528
[SPEAKER_14]: We had two committee meetings of the whole.

1594
02:21:16,137 --> 02:21:19,321
[SPEAKER_14]: in which this budget was approved and passed on March 24th.

1595
02:21:21,388 --> 02:21:27,751
[SPEAKER_14]: As you were referring to earlier, the mayor's proposed target budget is $85,490,000.

1596
02:21:27,951 --> 02:21:34,914
[SPEAKER_14]: That is an increase of 3% from the fiscal year 25 budget for the school department.

1597
02:21:36,034 --> 02:21:41,017
[SPEAKER_14]: Right now we're just sitting with an early variance of $2,093,290.

1598
02:21:41,437 --> 02:21:48,320
[SPEAKER_14]: And over the next few slides, Gerald McHugh and myself will be talking about how we'll be

1599
02:21:49,735 --> 02:22:01,108
[SPEAKER_14]: shrinking those gaps, as one would say, and also being creative with the finances of the city and our revenue to make sure that we meet the needs of the community.

1600
02:22:02,309 --> 02:22:05,893
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1601
02:22:06,182 --> 02:22:07,503
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Noel.

1602
02:22:08,203 --> 02:22:09,604
[SPEAKER_17]: And thank you, councillors.

1603
02:22:11,346 --> 02:22:19,872
[SPEAKER_17]: We did have a lot of information on the basis of the $87 million budget.

1604
02:22:20,152 --> 02:22:26,336
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's all pretty much detailed in our public hearing presentation, which is on the website.

1605
02:22:27,057 --> 02:22:31,540
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're certainly available to answer any questions you might have on that.

1606
02:22:33,320 --> 02:22:56,677
[SPEAKER_17]: We do have this variance between the budget that was approved by the school committee and the allocation that we got from the city, which we are not here to have an issue with, but we're committed to working with the city to see how we can kind of reconcile the two budgets and get what we need for FY26.

1607
02:22:59,351 --> 02:23:14,805
[SPEAKER_17]: In this exercise, we begin to look at available balances in our evolving funds that could be used to offset general fund appropriations, other special revenue funds as well.

1608
02:23:16,506 --> 02:23:22,231
[SPEAKER_17]: We do have some new spending that is now part of our proposal.

1609
02:23:22,291 --> 02:23:23,933
[SPEAKER_17]: So for the original budget,

1610
02:23:24,609 --> 02:23:30,931
[SPEAKER_17]: We took the position that we would keep any new positions requested to a minimum.

1611
02:23:30,991 --> 02:23:34,832
[SPEAKER_17]: We did add two in the $87 million budget.

1612
02:23:34,912 --> 02:23:45,715
[SPEAKER_17]: But since that time, we have a better understanding of where we are with federal grants, to the extent one can have a better understanding.

1613
02:23:47,518 --> 02:23:57,762
[SPEAKER_17]: And we have reached agreement with the Medford Teachers Union on the new schedule.

1614
02:23:57,982 --> 02:24:04,884
[SPEAKER_17]: So we were concerned would there be new positions that would be required from the new schedule.

1615
02:24:04,904 --> 02:24:11,987
[SPEAKER_17]: So we kind of postponed any new positions and we'll go over what those are in a moment.

1616
02:24:13,132 --> 02:24:21,681
[SPEAKER_17]: But we also identified some savings in the budget that was passed to offset some of those new costs that we're now proposing.

1617
02:24:22,321 --> 02:24:31,691
[SPEAKER_17]: And the big thing that we need to work together with the city on this will be a bigger conversation I think that will involve

1618
02:24:32,774 --> 02:24:40,057
[SPEAKER_17]: the mayor and the finance director is around the $4 million from question eight.

1619
02:24:40,657 --> 02:24:44,739
[SPEAKER_17]: So there were specific costs associated with that.

1620
02:24:45,459 --> 02:24:47,520
[SPEAKER_17]: The implementation of the new schedule.

1621
02:24:48,260 --> 02:24:52,822
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're going to have longer school days as a result of the new schedule.

1622
02:24:52,842 --> 02:25:00,965
[SPEAKER_17]: There's extra teacher days involved in the new contract.

1623
02:25:01,786 --> 02:25:01,986
[SPEAKER_17]: But

1624
02:25:03,845 --> 02:25:22,392
[SPEAKER_17]: Because we had contracts in place in FY25, and we had new contracts being negotiated at the end of this year, some of the question eight funds are spent in FY25, but some will be spent in FY26.

1625
02:25:22,452 --> 02:25:31,295
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're trying to come up with a way to, first of all, calculate how much is left in that $4 million.

1626
02:25:32,836 --> 02:25:37,660
[SPEAKER_17]: that could be made available to support the school budget in FY26.

1627
02:25:39,382 --> 02:25:55,676
[SPEAKER_17]: One idea we have that we'll talk about tonight is to create a stabilization fund to take that balance and reserve it for what the voters intended to use the money for.

1628
02:25:55,696 --> 02:25:57,037
[SPEAKER_17]: And then,

1629
02:26:01,340 --> 02:26:21,524
[SPEAKER_17]: Separately, we've proposed to kind of draw that money down over the three years of the contracts in order to avoid creating a fiscal cliff when it comes time to replace those stabilization funds, since they will be supporting the base budget.

1630
02:26:22,144 --> 02:26:25,645
[SPEAKER_17]: So we have a detailed slide on that as well.

1631
02:26:31,864 --> 02:26:43,809
[SPEAKER_17]: So for our revolving funds and special revenue funds, the state does provide reimbursement to communities for homeless transportation.

1632
02:26:43,829 --> 02:26:49,911
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a balance right now in that account of $391,000.

1633
02:26:49,951 --> 02:26:58,095
[SPEAKER_17]: We propose to use that to lower our homeless transportation appropriation.

1634
02:26:58,710 --> 02:27:01,733
[SPEAKER_17]: that will help close this variance that we have.

1635
02:27:02,413 --> 02:27:15,866
[SPEAKER_17]: We have some flexibility with our circuit breaker funds that are used for special education to offset appropriation increase in special education.

1636
02:27:16,506 --> 02:27:17,207
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we have

1637
02:27:18,344 --> 02:27:31,733
[SPEAKER_17]: balances in our Culinary Arts Fund revolving account and our MEAP revolving account that takes tuition in from parents in Medford.

1638
02:27:32,273 --> 02:27:39,898
[SPEAKER_17]: And we would be able to shift four positions that are currently in the general fund onto those revolving accounts.

1639
02:27:40,438 --> 02:27:40,859
[SPEAKER_17]: So that

1640
02:27:41,586 --> 02:27:43,650
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll allow savings of $955,000.

1641
02:27:43,690 --> 02:27:45,433
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll use that to try to close that variance that we have.

1642
02:27:53,148 --> 02:28:00,510
[SPEAKER_17]: The next item was some of the things that came up during budget hearings that we deferred until now.

1643
02:28:02,090 --> 02:28:07,332
[SPEAKER_17]: The high school principal has proposed creating an alternative learning program at the high school.

1644
02:28:07,372 --> 02:28:18,035
[SPEAKER_17]: So this is a small group instruction for students that have need to, have not earned,

1645
02:28:19,715 --> 02:28:32,023
[SPEAKER_17]: sufficient credits to graduate on time so this will be more lower student teacher ratios that will help them get back on track.

1646
02:28:33,284 --> 02:28:35,906
[SPEAKER_17]: This proposal has a English language arts

1647
02:28:36,752 --> 02:28:41,116
[SPEAKER_17]: a math science teacher and a social worker attached to this program.

1648
02:28:41,756 --> 02:28:44,358
[SPEAKER_17]: And if it's successful, we might expand it.

1649
02:28:45,639 --> 02:28:55,267
[SPEAKER_17]: But the vision right now would be for about 10 to 12 students that would be identified by staff.

1650
02:28:57,609 --> 02:29:01,993
[SPEAKER_17]: We proposing a part-time band teacher for the elementary schools.

1651
02:29:03,461 --> 02:29:13,509
[SPEAKER_17]: We kind of lost this position in FY 25 because we created a full-time band teacher at the high school.

1652
02:29:15,551 --> 02:29:24,779
[SPEAKER_17]: That position had some responsibilities for the elementary band, so this re-establishes that position in the budget.

1653
02:29:26,700 --> 02:29:35,305
[SPEAKER_17]: having to add back a guidance counselor at the middle school as a result of an arbitration award.

1654
02:29:37,166 --> 02:29:42,829
[SPEAKER_17]: We're projecting that we may need two teachers at the high school due to the new schedule.

1655
02:29:43,469 --> 02:29:46,671
[SPEAKER_17]: One is fairly firm in science.

1656
02:29:47,191 --> 02:29:50,693
[SPEAKER_17]: A second one is still to be determined.

1657
02:29:50,753 --> 02:29:52,975
[SPEAKER_17]: So that could possibly

1658
02:29:53,911 --> 02:29:59,172
[SPEAKER_17]: reduce the variance, but right now I think it's prudent to plan for two.

1659
02:30:00,493 --> 02:30:10,375
[SPEAKER_17]: And similarly, we think we might need an additional teacher for coverage, a specialist teacher at the Roberts for coverage.

1660
02:30:13,236 --> 02:30:27,742
[SPEAKER_17]: at that school that the specialists are fully scheduled, and they are necessary to cover prep time that the teachers are eligible to have.

1661
02:30:28,423 --> 02:30:33,765
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're proposing a BCBA position for the Andrews.

1662
02:30:33,845 --> 02:30:39,227
[SPEAKER_17]: And this is because one of our para behavior specialists

1663
02:30:43,078 --> 02:30:48,902
[SPEAKER_17]: earned her a college degree and credentials to become a full-fledged behavior analyst.

1664
02:30:49,443 --> 02:31:04,073
[SPEAKER_17]: And so you'll see on the next slide, we have some savings to offset that and a new lead stipend for college in Korea responsibilities within the guidance department.

1665
02:31:08,415 --> 02:31:13,677
[SPEAKER_17]: So we have identified some savings to offset those spending increases.

1666
02:31:15,178 --> 02:31:25,703
[SPEAKER_17]: We found that we provided for two extra Nexus specialist positions in the elementary.

1667
02:31:26,763 --> 02:31:30,865
[SPEAKER_17]: We had for two schools, we had two each.

1668
02:31:32,506 --> 02:31:35,067
[SPEAKER_17]: It should be one each, so we were kind of over,

1669
02:31:38,020 --> 02:31:39,321
[SPEAKER_17]: budgeted in that area.

1670
02:31:41,243 --> 02:31:47,908
[SPEAKER_17]: This year we added a teacher in grade one for EL strand with at McGlynn.

1671
02:31:50,249 --> 02:31:55,954
[SPEAKER_17]: We finding because of enrollment that we do not need that second teacher in FY 26.

1672
02:31:57,635 --> 02:31:59,615
[SPEAKER_17]: So we took a savings there.

1673
02:32:00,516 --> 02:32:04,137
[SPEAKER_17]: We talked about the behavior specialists that we'll just continue.

1674
02:32:05,857 --> 02:32:13,819
[SPEAKER_17]: We had, there was a, there was an effort to create positions called Serranquia paras in FY24.

1675
02:32:14,579 --> 02:32:22,201
[SPEAKER_17]: And the idea here would be that these, some of these paras would start later in the day around 1030 or 11, and then we'd work

1676
02:32:24,684 --> 02:32:32,088
[SPEAKER_17]: till about five and provide some time for the before and after school program.

1677
02:32:32,509 --> 02:32:37,272
[SPEAKER_17]: And that was not well received by the paras.

1678
02:32:37,332 --> 02:32:41,074
[SPEAKER_17]: There was only one person that opted to take that schedule.

1679
02:32:41,134 --> 02:32:45,537
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're gonna discontinue this ground care para in FY26.

1680
02:32:45,637 --> 02:32:49,299
[SPEAKER_17]: And we do have one more

1681
02:32:51,923 --> 02:32:59,427
[SPEAKER_17]: kindergarten para at the McGlynn than we need for the four kindergarten classrooms next year.

1682
02:33:05,490 --> 02:33:12,033
[SPEAKER_17]: And then this is a little more detail of what we were talking about for stabilization fund.

1683
02:33:13,794 --> 02:33:18,656
[SPEAKER_17]: The $4 million was added to the budget in FY25.

1684
02:33:22,428 --> 02:33:48,940
[SPEAKER_17]: As part of the new contracts that got negotiated, there's stipends available to certain departments to redesign the scope and sequence of how instruction is delivered during the day because there'll be a different number of periods and a different number of minutes per period

1685
02:33:49,688 --> 02:33:52,731
[SPEAKER_17]: and the day will be extended by 15 minutes.

1686
02:33:53,853 --> 02:33:59,238
[SPEAKER_17]: And the same thing happens with students that are on IEPs.

1687
02:33:59,899 --> 02:34:04,063
[SPEAKER_17]: All the IEPs have to be kind of rewritten around the new schedule.

1688
02:34:04,103 --> 02:34:12,352
[SPEAKER_17]: There'll be no loss of services, of course, to the students, but they might get allocated out on a slightly different schedule.

1689
02:34:14,493 --> 02:34:23,397
[SPEAKER_17]: And then there was a portion of the new teacher contract will be paid on the on June 30 of this year.

1690
02:34:24,417 --> 02:34:26,198
[SPEAKER_17]: And so that's going to leave.

1691
02:34:31,145 --> 02:34:45,557
[SPEAKER_17]: that we would want to preserve to make available in future fiscal years to offset the costs of the teachers and the paraprofessional contracts.

1692
02:34:47,239 --> 02:34:49,400
[SPEAKER_17]: And so we proposed this schedule.

1693
02:34:49,541 --> 02:34:55,025
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a number of different ways to do it, but if we utilized fully the 2.185,

1694
02:34:57,587 --> 02:35:05,814
[SPEAKER_17]: in FY26, in FY27, we would have to replace those funds.

1695
02:35:06,915 --> 02:35:12,300
[SPEAKER_17]: So it would operate similar to a grant in that respect.

1696
02:35:13,221 --> 02:35:22,929
[SPEAKER_17]: So one way to do it would be to just draw down that $2.1 million over three years, and that would minimize

1697
02:35:24,690 --> 02:35:31,313
[SPEAKER_17]: the annual replacement of funds in the subsequent year.

1698
02:35:36,115 --> 02:35:43,059
[SPEAKER_17]: So all those, this is just a summary sheet.

1699
02:35:43,539 --> 02:35:44,900
[SPEAKER_17]: We saved the 955,000, we added 367,000.

1700
02:35:49,557 --> 02:35:50,638
[SPEAKER_17]: due to new spending.

1701
02:35:51,378 --> 02:36:01,783
[SPEAKER_17]: We have this proposal for using stabilization fund to help support the FY 26 budget.

1702
02:36:02,563 --> 02:36:05,905
[SPEAKER_17]: We still are a little bit short

1703
02:36:06,454 --> 02:36:08,577
[SPEAKER_17]: in closing that variance.

1704
02:36:09,858 --> 02:36:11,941
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're continuing to work on that.

1705
02:36:14,464 --> 02:36:25,196
[SPEAKER_17]: And we have, you know, we'll have to wait until the mayor and the city council approve our

1706
02:36:26,117 --> 02:36:32,983
[SPEAKER_17]: and then we'll, uh, we still want to talk, you know, work with the city.

1707
02:36:33,643 --> 02:36:39,248
[SPEAKER_17]: To see how we can preserve those question eight funds for use in FY 26.

1708
02:36:40,990 --> 02:36:47,035
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we'll work on, uh, a recommendation to close up that remaining 400,000.

1709
02:36:47,615 --> 02:36:51,819
[SPEAKER_17]: And it could be we'll we'll have to go back and

1710
02:36:53,479 --> 02:37:05,672
[SPEAKER_17]: rethink our original budget proposal, is this spending that maybe we could defer to the following year or start in January, February.

1711
02:37:06,613 --> 02:37:15,882
[SPEAKER_17]: If we have any wiggle room in FY25, is this spending that we're planning for in FY26 that we could take care of in FY25 and

1712
02:37:17,438 --> 02:37:22,600
[SPEAKER_17]: and allow us to kind of be able to reduce the budget in FY26.

1713
02:37:23,120 --> 02:37:41,628
[SPEAKER_17]: And it might be a little bit more we could do with circuit breaker funds and revolving funds, but we are of course committed to producing a balanced budget for FY26.

1714
02:37:45,340 --> 02:37:45,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Jerry.

1715
02:37:45,860 --> 02:37:46,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Noel.

1716
02:37:46,521 --> 02:37:47,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Madam Superintendent.

1717
02:37:47,962 --> 02:37:53,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Appreciate the work you've done to get this down to 419,000.

1718
02:37:53,325 --> 02:37:59,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, that's still a number that is meaningful for staff and services for our students in our schools.

1719
02:37:59,510 --> 02:38:00,791
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm hoping we can do something.

1720
02:38:00,811 --> 02:38:03,993
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have a question from Councillor Collins, but I did want to ask you before that.

1721
02:38:04,942 --> 02:38:12,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, are there any one time or capital items built into the proposed operating budget approved by the school committee?

1722
02:38:13,509 --> 02:38:19,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, that we could look at potentially use of one time funds for funding those.

1723
02:38:20,415 --> 02:38:28,042
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, so we we've, um so building the grounds has been big focus of attention.

1724
02:38:28,402 --> 02:38:29,983
[SPEAKER_17]: And in the $87 million budget, we

1725
02:38:32,289 --> 02:38:37,756
[SPEAKER_17]: we're able to fully fund a variety of ongoing maintenance needs.

1726
02:38:39,542 --> 02:38:43,404
[SPEAKER_17]: that present themselves over the course of the year.

1727
02:38:44,945 --> 02:38:58,211
[SPEAKER_17]: We did establish a extraordinary maintenance budget as well to fund some of those one-time expenses within the school budget.

1728
02:38:58,291 --> 02:39:02,053
[SPEAKER_17]: Of course, the city's very generous with

1729
02:39:03,353 --> 02:39:15,361
[SPEAKER_17]: providing the school department with some of their capital money to do larger projects, but we wanna build some capacity within the school department budget to tackle some of those projects too.

1730
02:39:15,861 --> 02:39:26,047
[SPEAKER_17]: And we've just, it's in draft form now, but we did a complete assessment of all our elementary schools.

1731
02:39:26,107 --> 02:39:30,590
[SPEAKER_17]: We did not do one for the high school because the plans around the high school,

1732
02:39:31,675 --> 02:39:42,058
[SPEAKER_17]: we will have a document that will list kind of immediate needs for our buildings, immediate future and then future needs.

1733
02:39:42,138 --> 02:39:47,920
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's gonna give us a good roadmap for capital planning going forward.

1734
02:39:48,440 --> 02:39:54,122
[SPEAKER_17]: There's always gonna be one-time expenses in every fiscal year.

1735
02:39:56,401 --> 02:40:08,348
[SPEAKER_17]: But we did have a plan to replace the air conditioning systems that are inside our network rooms at all the schools.

1736
02:40:08,948 --> 02:40:16,612
[SPEAKER_17]: They were all pretty much non-functioning, and those rooms get very warm, could damage the equipment.

1737
02:40:18,593 --> 02:40:21,195
[SPEAKER_17]: So there was that, there was...

1738
02:40:24,937 --> 02:40:47,767
[SPEAKER_17]: servers, all our servers and power supplies for our network at or beyond their useful life so there was plan to replace those so there are areas that that we could use some additional funding and target those one time expenses.

1739
02:40:54,191 --> 02:40:54,431
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1740
02:40:54,451 --> 02:40:55,592
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you so much for the presentation.

1741
02:40:55,632 --> 02:40:56,292
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for being here.

1742
02:40:56,352 --> 02:40:57,993
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you also to the superintendent.

1743
02:40:59,214 --> 02:41:04,336
[SPEAKER_16]: I know a lot of work has gone into this recommendation already in your extensive process with the school committee, so thank you so much.

1744
02:41:05,217 --> 02:41:10,540
[SPEAKER_16]: Just to follow up quickly on a couple major line items from your presentation, it sounded to me like

1745
02:41:11,200 --> 02:41:22,972
[SPEAKER_16]: The educator and support staff positions that are being eliminated or deferred are ones that were calculated to be removable because of decreases in student enrollment.

1746
02:41:23,293 --> 02:41:28,818
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't hear a lot about positions being cut purely out of regard for the bottom line.

1747
02:41:28,839 --> 02:41:29,479
[SPEAKER_16]: Can you confirm that?

1748
02:41:30,540 --> 02:41:50,746
[SPEAKER_17]: So part of the original presentation was to let people know that this budget does not rely on kind of district-wide position cuts to fund the budget.

1749
02:41:50,806 --> 02:41:57,648
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's a bit of good news and kind of a relief for our staff to hear that.

1750
02:42:00,118 --> 02:42:11,801
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, our enrollment is fairly stable, and then there's, you know, pockets of, there is a concern around the EL program, you know, for obvious reasons.

1751
02:42:12,461 --> 02:42:14,261
[SPEAKER_17]: And so we're monitoring that.

1752
02:42:15,662 --> 02:42:22,743
[SPEAKER_17]: We certainly want those students to come to school where they can get the support services they need.

1753
02:42:25,624 --> 02:42:28,505
[SPEAKER_17]: But we may not see

1754
02:42:32,107 --> 02:42:36,231
[SPEAKER_17]: the flow of students into that program that we've seen in the past.

1755
02:42:37,472 --> 02:42:39,774
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's something that we're watching.

1756
02:42:41,035 --> 02:42:42,616
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, that's helpful and certainly it is.

1757
02:42:44,718 --> 02:42:51,765
[SPEAKER_16]: It's great to have a budget cycle where we don't have to balance the school budget on potentially removing position so thank you for your hard work and very grateful.

1758
02:42:53,226 --> 02:42:57,991
[SPEAKER_16]: For the passage of questions, seven to me which helped us get to this happy position as well.

1759
02:43:00,313 --> 02:43:15,628
[SPEAKER_16]: staying on the topic of the recommended reallocations to get those savings that are helping us bring that gap down to the roughly 500k number down from 2 million, moving some of those programs and they mentioned the circuit breaker

1760
02:43:17,329 --> 02:43:19,311
[SPEAKER_16]: And a couple other bullet points that are off the top of my head.

1761
02:43:20,351 --> 02:43:36,261
[SPEAKER_16]: These were previously in the school's operating budget now they're going to these other funding sources do these feel stable to you and we're talking about obviously this budget is avoidant of major quote unquote fiscal cliffs and that's important just curious about these specific programs that are being moved on to other funding sources.

1762
02:43:39,143 --> 02:43:41,485
[SPEAKER_17]: So for the revolving funds, you know, the

1763
02:43:43,127 --> 02:43:53,529
[SPEAKER_17]: Part of what we're doing is we want to work with the city to kind of make our budget line up with their ability to fund the budget.

1764
02:43:54,289 --> 02:44:03,230
[SPEAKER_17]: And the culinary arts program, for instance, is doing great.

1765
02:44:03,570 --> 02:44:06,011
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, there's new staff there.

1766
02:44:06,311 --> 02:44:07,931
[SPEAKER_17]: There's students that are excited.

1767
02:44:07,951 --> 02:44:10,592
[SPEAKER_17]: A lot of people are using that program.

1768
02:44:10,632 --> 02:44:12,352
[SPEAKER_17]: So there's money coming into the program.

1769
02:44:12,932 --> 02:44:25,517
[SPEAKER_17]: So those positions that you know I'm confident that they'll be, you know, those moves will be sustainable in the future on the meat program.

1770
02:44:26,307 --> 02:44:27,908
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, we'd have to keep an eye on that.

1771
02:44:27,948 --> 02:44:32,871
[SPEAKER_17]: They do have a fund balance that can absorb the two positions we proposed.

1772
02:44:33,812 --> 02:44:41,136
[SPEAKER_17]: And of course that fund balance will be supported by tuition payments this year.

1773
02:44:41,677 --> 02:44:44,758
[SPEAKER_17]: We're looking at the tuition rates that we're charging.

1774
02:44:46,319 --> 02:44:53,024
[SPEAKER_17]: So, but you know, there could come a time when we might have to bring one of those positions back into the general fund.

1775
02:44:54,685 --> 02:45:00,448
[SPEAKER_17]: And so those are the, that's the type of budget administration that you have to continuously do.

1776
02:45:01,329 --> 02:45:02,529
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, thank you very much.

1777
02:45:02,550 --> 02:45:05,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1778
02:45:05,411 --> 02:45:07,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have any further questions from members of the Council?

1779
02:45:09,574 --> 02:45:16,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Seeing none, do we have any comments on the Medford Public Schools budget from any members of the public, either in person or on Zoom?

1780
02:45:20,580 --> 02:45:34,296
[SPEAKER_03]: Also seeing none, I will will continue to work with you guys sounds like we have some work on a stabilization fund creation and appropriation to make sure that we can have that available for the fiscal plan that you've drawn up.

1781
02:45:35,056 --> 02:45:41,223
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that for one counselor and I'm think I speak, you know was in our budget recommendation to the mayor, two months ago.

1782
02:45:43,445 --> 02:45:56,394
[SPEAKER_03]: We certainly want to see as much as possible funded the school committee recommended budget versus the allocation from the city so that's something we're going to continue to advocate for and

1783
02:45:57,314 --> 02:46:04,456
[SPEAKER_03]: try to see what we can do to help provide fundings to limit the reductions that you guys have to make.

1784
02:46:05,116 --> 02:46:10,898
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think I speak for everyone city side, we really appreciate the hard work you put into getting that gap down.

1785
02:46:11,158 --> 02:46:12,838
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll continue to work on that.

1786
02:46:12,858 --> 02:46:16,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anything else that you guys like to add, or the superintendent?

1787
02:46:18,852 --> 02:46:19,312
[SPEAKER_17]: Good.

1788
02:46:19,352 --> 02:46:20,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

1789
02:46:20,213 --> 02:46:20,993
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, thank you.

[SPEAKER_03]: Just a reminder to everyone, this is the start of, well, not the start of, but we have a budget, initial proposal of the budget tonight on our agenda.

1793
02:46:34,822 --> 02:46:40,005
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll probably be looking at budget and finance items tonight and for both of our regular meetings on June 10th and June 24th.

1794
02:46:40,305 --> 02:46:42,846
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the end of our committee of the whole.

1795
