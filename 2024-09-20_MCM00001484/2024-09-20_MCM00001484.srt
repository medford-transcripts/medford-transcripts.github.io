[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

4
00:00:13,378 --> 00:00:26,607
[SPEAKER_02]: I will now call to order this meeting of the Ad Hoc Small Cell Committee of the City of Medford to hold hearings for Verizon applications for 18 proposed small cell infrastructure in the City of Medford.

5
00:00:26,627 --> 00:00:27,668
[SPEAKER_02]: This meeting is being recorded.

6
00:00:29,295 --> 00:00:40,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Pursuant to Chapter 20 of the Acts of 2021, this meeting of the Medford Ad Hoc Small Cell Committee will be conducted via remote participation to the greatest extent possible.

[SPEAKER_02]: So welcome.

13
00:01:37,803 --> 00:01:38,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Continue.

14
00:01:41,425 --> 00:01:42,985
[SPEAKER_02]: I did click continue on the record.

15
00:01:43,045 --> 00:01:44,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully everybody can hear me.

16
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:46,743
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so welcome.

17
00:01:47,643 --> 00:02:00,186
[SPEAKER_02]: This committee and this hearing is operated pursuant to the interim policy for small cell wireless installations, which is a result of an FCC declaratory ruling and order.

18
00:02:01,106 --> 00:02:02,366
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to introduce the committee.

19
00:02:03,146 --> 00:02:13,548
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you can see everybody's name there on the screen, the committee members are Paul Moki, the building commissioner, Mary Ann O'Connor, the director of public health, Alicia Hunt,

20
00:02:14,485 --> 00:02:16,266
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have to change this.

21
00:02:16,466 --> 00:02:19,467
[SPEAKER_02]: She's now the Director of Planning, Development and Sustainability.

22
00:02:19,487 --> 00:02:24,910
[SPEAKER_02]: And me, Tim McGibbon, City Engineer and Chair of the Committee.

23
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:32,333
[SPEAKER_02]: We're here to consider the following locations Verizon has applied for under the City of Medford Interim Policy.

24
00:02:32,353 --> 00:02:34,994
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just gonna read those locations real quickly.

25
00:02:35,014 --> 00:02:38,215
[SPEAKER_02]: So folks know they're at the right place.

26
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:42,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Yale Street at Dartmouth Street, Brookside Parkway,

27
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:59,863
[SPEAKER_02]: West Street, 39 Charnwood Road, 48 Clark Street, Gorley Road, 18 Fleming Street, 24 Pearl Street, 26 Royal Street, 40 Ashland Street, 23 Woodrow Avenue, 163 Forest Street, 199 Forest Street, 12 Fulton Street, 123 Grant Avenue, Logan Avenue,

28
00:03:11,809 --> 00:03:14,491
[SPEAKER_02]: 83 Washington Street and 59 Jerome Street.

29
00:03:23,056 --> 00:03:30,341
[SPEAKER_02]: As stated in the policy, the FCC declaratory ruling significantly limits the ability of cities and towns to regulate small cell wireless.

30
00:03:31,787 --> 00:03:38,211
[SPEAKER_02]: The committee's purview is limited to the policy, and we're not able to consider concerns.

31
00:03:38,691 --> 00:03:42,153
[SPEAKER_02]: A big one that a lot of folks I know are concerned about is the potential health impacts.

32
00:03:42,573 --> 00:03:45,155
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's outside the purview of this committee.

33
00:03:46,735 --> 00:03:52,879
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, what is outside the purview of this committee is whether or not the FCC standards do what they are supposed to do.

34
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:57,902
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're not here to discuss whether or not the FCC standards are appropriate.

35
00:04:00,557 --> 00:04:15,199
[SPEAKER_02]: With that said, if you are here because of health related concerns, we will certainly hear you and we certainly understand your concerns, but we recommend you contact your state and federal legislation as this law comes from the federal level of government.

36
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:23,808
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd also like to state up front that the city does not choose these locations.

37
00:04:23,989 --> 00:04:38,044
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we received some comments and also during the last round of hearings, there was seems to be this idea that the city has chosen locations that we don't, we are just reviewing them under the policy and whether or not they are approvable under this policy.

38
00:04:39,557 --> 00:04:45,100
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the last thing I'd like to do at the moment, we have our lawyer here, Robin Stein.

39
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:54,924
[SPEAKER_02]: I would just ask her to give a quick introduction of the purview of this committee and how it relates to that FCC declaratory ruling, specifically what is not within our purview.

40
00:04:55,384 --> 00:04:58,626
[SPEAKER_02]: So Robin, if you could just take a couple minutes and summarize that, that would be fantastic.

41
00:04:59,717 --> 00:05:02,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, I think you pretty much summed it up already, Tim.

42
00:05:02,239 --> 00:05:03,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening, everyone.

43
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,501
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Robin Stein.

44
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:08,464
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm an attorney at KP Law, a more special counsel to the city of Medford.

45
00:05:09,965 --> 00:05:22,175
[SPEAKER_05]: As Tim said, essentially, there is federal law that regulates the imposition of the provision of personal wireless services, personal wireless service facilities.

46
00:05:23,136 --> 00:05:28,320
[SPEAKER_05]: That law allows cities and towns to regulate those services and that infrastructure

47
00:05:29,051 --> 00:05:36,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so long as the application of the regulations doesn't materially inhibit or prohibit those services.

48
00:05:36,974 --> 00:05:40,395
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the city has a policy in place.

49
00:05:40,835 --> 00:05:43,436
[SPEAKER_05]: It can apply that policy to the applications.

50
00:05:43,956 --> 00:05:47,997
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so long as it doesn't create, uh, essentially a material prohibition of the services.

51
00:05:48,597 --> 00:05:53,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and that's, I'm sure a concept that we'll, we'll talk about a bit tonight, um, in undertaking that review.

52
00:05:54,704 --> 00:06:02,607
[SPEAKER_05]: As Tim said, one of the things that this committee is not permitted to consider are potential health impacts from the installations.

53
00:06:02,687 --> 00:06:05,148
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that something that is set by federal law?

54
00:06:06,148 --> 00:06:10,269
[SPEAKER_05]: So, certainly available if more questions come up, but that is the basic framework.

55
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,090
[SPEAKER_05]: The city's gonna apply its policy.

56
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:17,112
[SPEAKER_05]: It can't apply its policy in a way that materially prohibits the provision of the wireless services.

57
00:06:18,332 --> 00:06:19,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Robin, appreciate it.

58
00:06:19,273 --> 00:06:20,213
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course.

59
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,942
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so I'm just gonna summarize the agenda so people know what to expect.

60
00:06:26,163 --> 00:06:29,605
[SPEAKER_02]: After this introduction, Verizon will be given an opportunity to make a presentation.

61
00:06:31,206 --> 00:06:35,709
[SPEAKER_02]: After the presentation, the committee members will be given an opportunity to ask questions to Verizon.

62
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:42,554
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be a public comment period for non-site specific, or in other words, general comments.

63
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:49,939
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll go into, at the beginning of that, there'll be, we'll look at email comments as well, because I know comments came in via email.

64
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:59,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I'll call on voices in favor of the applications and then I'll call on voices in opposition of the applications, everyone who speaks will receive two minutes.

65
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,501
[SPEAKER_02]: and questions to Verizon should be directed to the chair.

66
00:07:04,282 --> 00:07:09,785
[SPEAKER_02]: And also while you're speaking, we'll give you a warning when it gets close to the end of the two minutes, so folks can wrap things up.

67
00:07:10,725 --> 00:07:14,047
[SPEAKER_02]: After this public comment period, we will discuss each application location.

68
00:07:14,707 --> 00:07:18,389
[SPEAKER_02]: After the committee discusses, the public will be able to make site-specific comments.

69
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, that'll be two minutes per speaker.

70
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:24,593
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, if you have site-specific comments, please try to save those until the site comes up.

71
00:07:26,425 --> 00:07:36,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Then there'll be more discussion by the committee or there may be, and then we'll move into a motion and I'll open the floor for a motion by committee member to vote on the applications one at a time.

72
00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:45,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Presuming the motion carries, the chair will indicate the members may grant, grant with conditions or deny each application and the vote will be taken through roll call.

73
00:07:47,293 --> 00:07:48,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Here are the rules of the hearing.

74
00:07:49,477 --> 00:07:53,500
[SPEAKER_02]: Please use the raise hand function if you'd like to comment during the public participation periods.

75
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:59,304
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have an issue with that, or if you'd like to submit your comment through the chat, the chat is available to do that.

76
00:08:00,525 --> 00:08:02,646
[SPEAKER_02]: But please try not to abuse that.

77
00:08:02,846 --> 00:08:05,228
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it worked out well when we've done this before.

78
00:08:05,248 --> 00:08:08,050
[SPEAKER_02]: So we will be looking there.

79
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:15,055
[SPEAKER_02]: If folks have trouble with the raise hand, technical issues, don't want to speak for some reason, they want to put it in writing, that's OK.

80
00:08:16,983 --> 00:08:19,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Please direct comments and questions to the chair through me.

81
00:08:20,227 --> 00:08:24,292
[SPEAKER_02]: No profanity, no name calling, no other rude or disruptive behavior.

82
00:08:25,032 --> 00:08:26,074
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just not acceptable.

83
00:08:26,594 --> 00:08:30,179
[SPEAKER_02]: The chair reserves the right to mute participants who become disruptive to the proceedings.

84
00:08:32,681 --> 00:08:37,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Each speaker will receive two minutes, as I stated before, and then a couple of ground rules for time.

85
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:41,125
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna set an end time at 10 p.m.

86
00:08:41,485 --> 00:08:42,866
[SPEAKER_02]: If this reaches 10 p.m.

87
00:08:42,906 --> 00:08:49,272
[SPEAKER_02]: and there's still applications left, we will look to continue the hearing to a specific date certain.

88
00:08:50,173 --> 00:08:51,714
[SPEAKER_02]: We also take a break at 8 p.m.

89
00:08:51,814 --> 00:08:54,817
[SPEAKER_02]: for just five minute break so people can do what they need to do.

90
00:08:57,526 --> 00:09:00,648
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the next piece in the agenda, introduce map locations.

91
00:09:00,928 --> 00:09:06,733
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the city's website, not only did we include the applications themselves, but we also mapped all the locations.

92
00:09:06,953 --> 00:09:07,653
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's available.

93
00:09:07,693 --> 00:09:13,798
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we go through each location, we'll be bringing up the map to look at them on the map for discussion.

94
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:28,763
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I'm now going to ask the applicant to introduce themselves to the committee, and if they have a presentation to make, they're welcome to make that on these 18 applications.

95
00:09:29,504 --> 00:09:33,544
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after the presentation, we'll ask some questions before going into the public comment period.

96
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:36,325
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Lyson?

97
00:09:36,885 --> 00:09:37,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, very good.

98
00:09:37,685 --> 00:09:37,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

99
00:09:37,965 --> 00:09:39,425
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we do have a presentation.

100
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:41,846
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, Stan, are you running that presentation?

101
00:09:41,866 --> 00:09:45,846
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Stan is muted now.

102
00:09:49,447 --> 00:09:51,811
[SPEAKER_12]: This is Kathleen Finn from Verizon.

103
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:56,958
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't seem to have the privilege to be able to share the screen.

104
00:09:58,801 --> 00:09:59,662
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, I do now.

105
00:10:01,124 --> 00:10:01,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Kathleen.

106
00:10:06,244 --> 00:10:07,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thank you.

107
00:10:07,465 --> 00:10:14,152
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you for hearing our applications tonight to the committee and to the people who were in attendance here.

108
00:10:15,594 --> 00:10:27,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Similar to the group that the committee addressed last spring, these are all applications for attaching equipment to existing utility poles and slide.

109
00:10:30,141 --> 00:10:33,783
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna explain to you more about it as we go along.

110
00:10:33,863 --> 00:10:36,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Verizon has a public information website.

111
00:10:37,485 --> 00:10:57,535
[SPEAKER_03]: So in addition to the information that's on the city's website, you can go to improveyourwireless.com Medford, and you also can email Verizon if you have direct questions or comments at the address that's on the screen now, vzw.medford.small.cell.program at verizonwireless.com.

112
00:10:58,756 --> 00:10:59,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Slide.

113
00:11:01,531 --> 00:11:03,832
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to introduce the team we have here tonight.

114
00:11:03,892 --> 00:11:08,555
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Mike Chima with the law firm Robinson and Cole, and I'm legal counsel on this application.

115
00:11:09,175 --> 00:11:16,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Stan Yusevich is the Verizon Government Affairs representative, and he'll be speaking to you after me.

116
00:11:16,999 --> 00:11:19,821
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Jason Flanagan, who's a radio frequency engineer.

117
00:11:19,861 --> 00:11:23,663
[SPEAKER_03]: That means he helps design the network from a technical standpoint.

118
00:11:24,524 --> 00:11:30,747
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Sean Conway, who's a Verizon engineer, and he will describe the small cell equipment and the process

119
00:11:31,612 --> 00:11:34,195
[SPEAKER_03]: that Verizon went through to determine poll locations.

120
00:11:34,915 --> 00:11:41,122
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we've invited Dr. Eric Swanson, who is a professor of physics at the University of Pittsburgh.

121
00:11:41,522 --> 00:11:46,828
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dr. Swanson will cover the safety of small cells and answer questions if folks have them.

122
00:11:47,909 --> 00:11:48,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Slide, please, Kathleen.

123
00:11:50,163 --> 00:11:56,468
[SPEAKER_03]: And the chair went through a little of this, I'm just gonna be very brief, but there's a legal context for these applications.

124
00:11:56,929 --> 00:12:05,977
[SPEAKER_03]: First, Medford has a small cell policy, and that policy governs the committee on these to the extent not inconsistent with federal law.

125
00:12:06,948 --> 00:12:12,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Federal law does govern a lot of aspects of these types of installations.

126
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:18,212
[SPEAKER_03]: The federal law imposes a 60-day time limit to approve or deny the small cell applications.

127
00:12:18,692 --> 00:12:21,053
[SPEAKER_03]: In this case, we've given the city an extension.

128
00:12:21,113 --> 00:12:23,454
[SPEAKER_03]: We filed these applications back in June.

129
00:12:24,253 --> 00:12:27,836
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've given the city an extension so we could be heard tonight.

130
00:12:29,377 --> 00:12:34,460
[SPEAKER_03]: Federal law also controls the extent to which a city can regulate the design of small cells.

131
00:12:35,201 --> 00:12:44,327
[SPEAKER_03]: And it prohibits municipalities from placing a moratorium on small cell deployment or from prohibiting service from being provided in an area.

132
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:51,752
[SPEAKER_03]: And federal law also says municipalities may not evaluate small cell applications based on health concerns.

133
00:12:52,993 --> 00:12:53,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Slide, please.

134
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Stan's gonna speak to you now.

135
00:12:59,290 --> 00:12:59,831
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mike.

136
00:13:00,751 --> 00:13:01,912
[SPEAKER_18]: I hope I'm off mute.

137
00:13:01,992 --> 00:13:02,712
[SPEAKER_18]: I believe I am.

138
00:13:03,113 --> 00:13:10,517
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to thank the members of the ad hoc committee and the members of the public that are here today watching via Zoom.

139
00:13:11,538 --> 00:13:25,827
[SPEAKER_18]: As you're aware, Verizon is prepared to make a significant investment in Medford's technology infrastructure, as we have in other neighboring communities, such as Somerville, Cambridge, Revere, Malden, and Boston.

140
00:13:26,627 --> 00:13:34,210
[SPEAKER_18]: In recent years, Verizon started bringing the next generation of wireless technology to the region's larger cities like Boston.

141
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:37,071
[SPEAKER_18]: Now we're expanding to new cities and towns.

142
00:13:37,452 --> 00:13:40,953
[SPEAKER_18]: We've chosen Medford to provide better wireless coverage.

143
00:13:41,913 --> 00:13:47,996
[SPEAKER_18]: This effort is to better serve your residents, schoolchildren, and businesses.

144
00:13:49,137 --> 00:13:57,265
[SPEAKER_18]: The applications we've submitted are a starting point to provide these benefits to the neighborhoods of Medford.

145
00:13:57,805 --> 00:14:05,813
[SPEAKER_18]: Our plan, however, will provide improved wireless service for the entire city.

146
00:14:06,834 --> 00:14:07,655
[SPEAKER_18]: Next slide, please.

147
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:13,641
[SPEAKER_18]: We have all witnessed the rapid growth in demand for wireless services.

148
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:21,123
[SPEAKER_18]: This demand for wireless technology has increased dramatically since the COVID-19 outbreak.

149
00:14:21,303 --> 00:14:26,026
[SPEAKER_18]: People are working from their homes and their children are being educated remotely.

150
00:14:27,026 --> 00:14:33,990
[SPEAKER_18]: As we see from tonight's hearing, technology is making it possible for the important work of local government to continue.

151
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:35,050
[SPEAKER_18]: Slide.

152
00:14:37,071 --> 00:14:42,734
[SPEAKER_18]: Wireless technology has quickly progressed since the first cell phones were introduced

153
00:14:43,753 --> 00:14:50,156
[SPEAKER_18]: Each generation of cell phone technology has expanded technology capabilities.

154
00:14:51,117 --> 00:14:56,539
[SPEAKER_18]: Second generation technology enabled us to view emails on our phones.

155
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:03,883
[SPEAKER_18]: And the third generation brought us GPS, enabling us to use our phones to help us navigate.

156
00:15:04,984 --> 00:15:08,546
[SPEAKER_18]: 4G technology enabled streaming of videos.

157
00:15:08,966 --> 00:15:13,108
[SPEAKER_18]: Now we are migrating to the fifth generation, or 5G technology.

158
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:18,283
[SPEAKER_18]: that will greatly enhance the speed and capability of our cell phones.

159
00:15:18,923 --> 00:15:19,284
[SPEAKER_18]: Slide.

160
00:15:21,105 --> 00:15:24,647
[SPEAKER_18]: The promise and benefit of the future of 5G is bright.

161
00:15:25,068 --> 00:15:41,919
[SPEAKER_18]: Collectively, we can imagine and create opportunities for greater energy efficiencies in our buildings, traffic signaling coordination, communication reliability for our first responders, and increased access for remote learning.

162
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:42,900
[SPEAKER_18]: Slide.

163
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:52,324
[SPEAKER_18]: The 5G economy will have a significant impact on America's cities and towns, large and small.

164
00:15:53,025 --> 00:16:05,711
[SPEAKER_18]: Over the next 10 years, we will see benefits across the country, including $43 billion in economic growth and the creation of 100,000 new jobs in Massachusetts alone.

165
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:07,152
[SPEAKER_18]: Slide.

166
00:16:11,073 --> 00:16:21,377
[SPEAKER_18]: A May 2001 research study asked homeowners what they prioritize when it came to buying a new home.

167
00:16:21,857 --> 00:16:32,262
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's clear that homeowners prioritize 5G and high speed internet, eight out of 10, saying that having 5G as a home internet

168
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,870
[SPEAKER_18]: creates greater value.

169
00:16:35,431 --> 00:16:46,294
[SPEAKER_18]: Over the past year, realtors have also been fielding more questions from homeowners about access to broadband, home internet, and cellular service.

170
00:16:46,774 --> 00:16:47,174
[SPEAKER_18]: Slide.

171
00:16:48,954 --> 00:16:54,316
[SPEAKER_18]: You can see here that homebuyers prioritize fast, reliable home internet.

172
00:16:55,449 --> 00:17:04,637
[SPEAKER_18]: as good cellular service over modern appliances, nearby attractions and amenities, commute time, and good schools.

173
00:17:05,418 --> 00:17:09,262
[SPEAKER_18]: These are the reasons that we are here and these are the reasons why

174
00:17:10,408 --> 00:17:12,630
[SPEAKER_18]: you have these applications before you.

175
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:17,673
[SPEAKER_18]: I respectfully ask that you support and improve these applications.

176
00:17:18,194 --> 00:17:22,837
[SPEAKER_18]: I wanna thank you for your time and I appreciate your service to this community.

177
00:17:23,538 --> 00:17:27,761
[SPEAKER_18]: Next, I'll turn to Jason Flanagan, Verizon RF engineer.

178
00:17:31,243 --> 00:17:32,524
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi, my name is Jason Flanagan.

179
00:17:32,604 --> 00:17:34,646
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm the RF engineer for the city of Medford.

180
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:40,110
[SPEAKER_17]: This slide gives you an example of how far one of the cells we're talking about will cover.

181
00:17:40,967 --> 00:17:47,632
[SPEAKER_17]: Our Verizon's 5G Ultra Wideband technology uses a much higher frequency than we previously used with our 4G technology.

182
00:17:47,652 --> 00:17:53,256
[SPEAKER_17]: A higher frequency will not travel as far as a lower frequency due to the physics and how a signal travels through the air.

183
00:17:54,297 --> 00:17:58,961
[SPEAKER_17]: This works similarly to how you hear a car with a loud stereo driving by when you're walking down the street.

184
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:04,925
[SPEAKER_17]: First, you hear the low frequency bass notes, and then as the car gets closer, you'll hear the high frequency vocal notes.

185
00:18:05,645 --> 00:18:08,888
[SPEAKER_17]: High frequency notes are also the first to fade as the car drives away from you.

186
00:18:10,236 --> 00:18:12,677
[SPEAKER_17]: Next, we will have Sean Conway with some sighting notes.

187
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,320
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, everyone.

188
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:21,201
[SPEAKER_16]: Sean Conway, an engineer at Verizon Wireless.

189
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:23,742
[SPEAKER_16]: I work on the real estate for small cells.

190
00:18:25,043 --> 00:18:32,887
[SPEAKER_16]: As you can see from what Jason showed us there with the map, we have a very small area to go out and select a location that will work for our 5G network.

191
00:18:33,467 --> 00:18:39,470
[SPEAKER_16]: So once Jason selects a location, we go out and try to select a good pole to attach our antennas and equipment to.

192
00:18:40,942 --> 00:18:43,825
[SPEAKER_16]: Shown here is an example of what a 5G location looks like.

193
00:18:44,445 --> 00:18:47,488
[SPEAKER_16]: Our antennas and radios will be up top of the pole in this case.

194
00:18:48,308 --> 00:18:50,931
[SPEAKER_16]: We have our fiber connection down in the middle of the pole.

195
00:18:51,932 --> 00:18:55,074
[SPEAKER_16]: And then lower on the pole, we have a power disconnect and the power meter.

196
00:18:55,515 --> 00:19:03,962
[SPEAKER_16]: The power disconnect is to allow anyone that's working in the area that needed to go up onto the pole, they could shut down the site without asking us.

197
00:19:04,002 --> 00:19:07,625
[SPEAKER_16]: They could just shut it down, go up, do their work, and then turn it back on when they left.

198
00:19:11,012 --> 00:19:15,596
[SPEAKER_16]: And basically our only design options that we're looking for in Medford are utility poles.

199
00:19:15,656 --> 00:19:18,818
[SPEAKER_16]: But we have in other areas used streetlights and traffic signals.

200
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,199
[SPEAKER_16]: Slide, please.

201
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:30,687
[SPEAKER_16]: And just to give you guys a representation of the size of the antennas that are up on the telephone pole, it's about the size of a small parking sign.

202
00:19:31,067 --> 00:19:32,388
[SPEAKER_16]: This one taken from the city of Boston.

203
00:19:32,408 --> 00:19:34,250
[SPEAKER_16]: You can see it's about the same size as that.

204
00:19:35,671 --> 00:19:38,573
[SPEAKER_16]: Next, I'm going to pass it on to Dr. Eric Swanson.

205
00:19:42,532 --> 00:19:45,495
[SPEAKER_19]: Good evening, Mr. Chair and members of the committee and everyone else.

206
00:19:46,876 --> 00:19:49,559
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm happy to talk to you tonight about the safety of this equipment.

207
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:57,766
[SPEAKER_19]: As we noted, I am a professor of physics at the University of Pittsburgh and just a bit more information about me.

208
00:19:58,347 --> 00:20:00,829
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm also a fellow of the American Physical Society.

209
00:20:00,849 --> 00:20:06,254
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm a member of the Union of Concerned Scientists and a former resident of Dorchester.

210
00:20:07,464 --> 00:20:13,808
[SPEAKER_19]: The information I'll be giving you is the consensus scientific view on the health effects of radiofrequency radiation.

211
00:20:14,028 --> 00:20:19,152
[SPEAKER_19]: In other words, it's what the broad scientific community believes about that issue.

212
00:20:19,612 --> 00:20:20,292
[SPEAKER_19]: Next slide, please.

213
00:20:22,994 --> 00:20:27,357
[SPEAKER_19]: As you know, cell phones receive and transmit electromagnetic waves.

214
00:20:28,298 --> 00:20:33,321
[SPEAKER_19]: Those waves can be described by the frequency or energy of them or by their wavelength.

215
00:20:33,481 --> 00:20:35,943
[SPEAKER_19]: And if you think about ocean waves, that's a good analog.

216
00:20:37,435 --> 00:20:45,721
[SPEAKER_19]: The figure here shows what's called the spectrum, which is the totality of all the possible waves labeled by their wavelengths or their frequency.

217
00:20:46,281 --> 00:20:48,082
[SPEAKER_19]: And parts of this are very familiar to you.

218
00:20:48,182 --> 00:20:50,984
[SPEAKER_19]: So that little slice in the middle there is visible light.

219
00:20:51,224 --> 00:20:52,805
[SPEAKER_19]: Light is electromagnetic waves.

220
00:20:53,265 --> 00:20:55,727
[SPEAKER_19]: And you see it broken out into the colors of the rainbow.

221
00:20:56,628 --> 00:21:02,073
[SPEAKER_19]: If you go higher in frequency or higher in energy, you hit ultraviolet light, which we're also familiar with.

222
00:21:02,614 --> 00:21:07,198
[SPEAKER_19]: Higher still in frequency or energy is X-rays, and higher than that is gamma rays.

223
00:21:07,578 --> 00:21:17,647
[SPEAKER_19]: If you go down, you also hit familiar things, thermal radiation that you may have seen in movies with these night image cameras, microwaves, radio waves, and so on.

224
00:21:18,448 --> 00:21:19,089
[SPEAKER_19]: Next slide, please.

225
00:21:21,004 --> 00:21:27,507
[SPEAKER_19]: 5G, just for our information, sits there somewhere between radio and thermal in the spectrum.

226
00:21:28,268 --> 00:21:28,988
[SPEAKER_19]: Next slide, please.

227
00:21:31,129 --> 00:21:38,312
[SPEAKER_19]: Some parts of the spectrum are dangerous in a way that I'll describe to people and to animals.

228
00:21:38,773 --> 00:21:40,814
[SPEAKER_19]: It's called the ionizing spectrum.

229
00:21:41,654 --> 00:21:43,015
[SPEAKER_19]: It's indicated in red there.

230
00:21:43,515 --> 00:21:47,757
[SPEAKER_19]: It starts at frequencies associated with ultraviolet radiation.

231
00:21:48,668 --> 00:21:55,697
[SPEAKER_19]: The way it works is that this radiation, these waves, are energetic enough that they can actually strip electrons off of atoms.

232
00:21:56,137 --> 00:22:01,824
[SPEAKER_19]: And if you do that to the wrong molecules in your skin cells, for instance, that can cause tissue damage.

233
00:22:03,326 --> 00:22:05,549
[SPEAKER_19]: That, by the way, is what leads to tanning of skin.

234
00:22:07,151 --> 00:22:07,752
[SPEAKER_19]: Next slide, please.

235
00:22:09,818 --> 00:22:13,019
[SPEAKER_19]: The waves we're talking about are below that threshold.

236
00:22:13,059 --> 00:22:18,640
[SPEAKER_19]: There actually is a threshold above which that effect can happen and below which it doesn't happen.

237
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,560
[SPEAKER_19]: It's indicated in green here.

238
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,721
[SPEAKER_19]: The green is called non-ionizing radiation.

239
00:22:24,261 --> 00:22:28,582
[SPEAKER_19]: It doesn't have sufficient energy to actually strip electrons from atoms.

240
00:22:28,622 --> 00:22:31,282
[SPEAKER_19]: And because of that, it can't do things like damage DNA.

241
00:22:31,742 --> 00:22:34,883
[SPEAKER_19]: And you're actually familiar with this on an intuitive level.

242
00:22:35,906 --> 00:22:45,518
[SPEAKER_19]: artificial lights like the ones I'm sitting under and everyone else is sitting under right now only produce waves in the visible part of the spectrum that's below the threshold.

243
00:22:45,979 --> 00:22:51,867
[SPEAKER_19]: And as you know, you don't get tan from sitting underneath those lights and certainly don't get things like skin cancer.

244
00:22:53,282 --> 00:23:02,168
[SPEAKER_19]: The physics of how that works tells us that it doesn't matter how long you were underneath the lights, which you also know, and it doesn't matter how intense those lights are.

245
00:23:02,768 --> 00:23:08,251
[SPEAKER_19]: What would happen if I were to turn up the intensity of the lights over me right now is that I would feel heat from those lights.

246
00:23:08,672 --> 00:23:15,636
[SPEAKER_19]: And in fact, that is the only verified effect of non-ionizing radiation is that it heats the material.

247
00:23:16,576 --> 00:23:17,237
[SPEAKER_19]: Next slide, please.

248
00:23:19,238 --> 00:23:20,539
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, so I already covered that.

249
00:23:21,479 --> 00:23:22,120
[SPEAKER_19]: Next slide, please.

250
00:23:24,223 --> 00:23:37,688
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, and just to fill in a bit more details again, so I already mentioned 5G, 5G is near microwave, 4G is a little bit below that, and standard radio like your AM and FM stations operate a little bit below that.

251
00:23:38,648 --> 00:23:53,793
[SPEAKER_19]: 5G itself is about a factor of 30,000 below this threshold, which is reassuring, it's a big number, but I want to stress that even if you were only a factor of two or one and a half below the threshold, it's a threshold, it's non-ionizing,

252
00:23:54,303 --> 00:23:57,586
[SPEAKER_19]: it's still safe in terms of damage to skin cells.

253
00:23:58,586 --> 00:23:59,327
[SPEAKER_19]: Next slide, please.

254
00:24:00,828 --> 00:24:06,752
[SPEAKER_19]: So I mentioned that the effect that this non-ionizing radiation does have is thermal, it heats things.

255
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:15,559
[SPEAKER_19]: And again, you know this, if you step out into the sun, you'll feel warm, or if you step underneath a very bright light, you'll feel heat from that light.

256
00:24:16,866 --> 00:24:23,272
[SPEAKER_19]: The FCC, because of this, the FCC regulates this radiation, these non-ionizing waves.

257
00:24:24,192 --> 00:24:25,454
[SPEAKER_19]: Their limits are very strict.

258
00:24:25,734 --> 00:24:29,077
[SPEAKER_19]: There are thousands upon thousands of studies that are done on the effects of this.

259
00:24:29,557 --> 00:24:38,685
[SPEAKER_19]: And what they do is that they take the minimal levels where anything can happen, anything is detectable, and reduce those by an additional factor of 50 to set their limits.

260
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,621
[SPEAKER_19]: All the equipment that is installed meets these equipments.

261
00:24:42,821 --> 00:24:47,023
[SPEAKER_19]: And even if more equipment is installed, it still needs to meet these limits.

262
00:24:48,024 --> 00:25:00,870
[SPEAKER_19]: Just for comparison, a typical heating pad, I show a heating pad here, one of those red rubbery things that you fill with hot water, those would violate FCC limits by about a factor of 50, 50 times higher than they would permit.

263
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:06,272
[SPEAKER_19]: And by the way, I kind of like those heating pads, so I'm not exactly alarmed by them.

264
00:25:06,933 --> 00:25:07,633
[SPEAKER_19]: Next slide, please.

265
00:25:10,105 --> 00:25:15,146
[SPEAKER_19]: There is this myth that the FCC is behind in its regulation of this equipment, but that's not true.

266
00:25:15,186 --> 00:25:17,627
[SPEAKER_19]: They regularly update their regulations.

267
00:25:17,947 --> 00:25:22,709
[SPEAKER_19]: They regularly consult with the agencies that deal with these things.

268
00:25:22,829 --> 00:25:24,109
[SPEAKER_19]: FCC doesn't do it directly.

269
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:31,351
[SPEAKER_19]: Things like people like the FDA do and the IEEE and American Medical Association, and they regularly review.

270
00:25:32,291 --> 00:25:34,932
[SPEAKER_19]: Just recently, several hundred new studies were examined.

271
00:25:36,323 --> 00:25:47,591
[SPEAKER_19]: And the last point I'd like to make is that typical 5G small cells on your streets will be operating at about 250 times below the strict FCC limits.

272
00:25:48,752 --> 00:25:50,433
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, with that, I'll turn it back to Mike.

273
00:25:50,593 --> 00:25:51,353
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you very much.

274
00:25:58,058 --> 00:26:03,642
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.

275
00:26:05,318 --> 00:26:06,198
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thanks, great.

276
00:26:07,059 --> 00:26:16,902
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a list of the addresses for the small cell pole attachments that we've applied to the city for and are being heard tonight.

277
00:26:16,922 --> 00:26:21,723
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll leave that up for a few seconds.

278
00:26:23,284 --> 00:26:24,684
[SPEAKER_03]: And then slide, please.

279
00:26:26,405 --> 00:26:28,086
[SPEAKER_03]: And this concludes our presentation.

280
00:26:28,446 --> 00:26:29,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for your attention.

281
00:26:30,006 --> 00:26:32,207
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole panel will remain available

282
00:26:32,852 --> 00:26:38,034
[SPEAKER_03]: for questions that the committee or the public may have throughout the hearing tonight.

283
00:26:38,374 --> 00:26:38,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

284
00:26:45,477 --> 00:26:47,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much, Team Verizon.

285
00:26:47,478 --> 00:26:53,140
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so now we'll take questions and comments from the committee members.

286
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:57,022
[SPEAKER_02]: So Paul, Marianne, and Alicia, if you have questions, I'll let you guys go first.

287
00:27:05,348 --> 00:27:16,575
[SPEAKER_10]: Dr. Swanson, could you speak to the distance and the impact of distance as far as the radio frequency waves go?

288
00:27:18,431 --> 00:27:19,091
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, thank you.

289
00:27:19,131 --> 00:27:19,852
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd be happy to.

290
00:27:20,452 --> 00:27:21,293
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a good question.

291
00:27:22,533 --> 00:27:24,194
[SPEAKER_19]: The distance does matter.

292
00:27:24,695 --> 00:27:39,163
[SPEAKER_19]: So the further away you are from the equipment, the further underneath the FCC limits you are, for every factor of two you move away, the safety factor grows by a factor of four.

293
00:27:39,763 --> 00:27:42,305
[SPEAKER_19]: So the figures I gave you were if you were

294
00:27:42,625 --> 00:27:48,330
[SPEAKER_19]: as close as you can reasonably get to one of these 5G small cell things, which will be standing underneath it.

295
00:27:50,011 --> 00:27:52,253
[SPEAKER_19]: As you move further away, it'll just get less and less.

296
00:27:57,237 --> 00:28:00,060
[SPEAKER_10]: And are there limitations set on by the FCC?

297
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,982
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry, I missed the first part of what you said.

298
00:28:03,142 --> 00:28:07,586
[SPEAKER_10]: Are there distance limits put on by the regulations by the FCC?

299
00:28:08,207 --> 00:28:09,248
[SPEAKER_19]: Are there distance limits?

300
00:28:09,348 --> 00:28:10,769
[SPEAKER_19]: No, they don't specifically

301
00:28:11,668 --> 00:28:14,109
[SPEAKER_19]: regulate how close you can get to one of these.

302
00:28:14,689 --> 00:28:20,470
[SPEAKER_19]: What they do is regulate the exposure that you're allowed to get, the amount of heating you're allowed to get.

303
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:22,891
[SPEAKER_19]: And that has to be below a certain amount.

304
00:28:24,611 --> 00:28:25,771
[SPEAKER_10]: That's time related?

305
00:28:27,212 --> 00:28:28,732
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not actually time related.

306
00:28:28,792 --> 00:28:32,453
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just it's how much you receive in total.

307
00:28:34,333 --> 00:28:37,574
[SPEAKER_19]: So, you know, how much energy

308
00:28:38,321 --> 00:28:42,685
[SPEAKER_19]: basically how much heating you get is what it regulates.

309
00:28:44,966 --> 00:28:58,037
[SPEAKER_06]: If I might, Miriam, what I think I'm, I, that makes me ask if I was a resident and I felt like I was too close to one for a lane, how do I know if I'm too close?

310
00:28:58,297 --> 00:29:01,960
[SPEAKER_06]: We assume, I assume a Verizon worker has something that they wear, right?

311
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:05,383
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you go into a radiation room or something, right?

312
00:29:05,403 --> 00:29:05,703
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a,

313
00:29:06,228 --> 00:29:08,615
[SPEAKER_06]: thing that tells you if you've had too much exposure?

314
00:29:09,237 --> 00:29:13,088
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, how would somebody know that they've been too close for too long?

315
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,961
[SPEAKER_19]: I can answer that too, if that's okay.

316
00:29:18,061 --> 00:29:19,842
[SPEAKER_19]: And maybe one of our engineers can chip in too.

317
00:29:21,223 --> 00:29:30,068
[SPEAKER_19]: The way it works, if you're repairing this stuff, the FCC, you know, if you're right next to it, you're going to be pushing the limits.

318
00:29:30,428 --> 00:29:33,010
[SPEAKER_19]: So the FCC, I mean, they just recommend to turn it off.

319
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:36,352
[SPEAKER_19]: So when people go in to repair these things, they shut them off.

320
00:29:36,372 --> 00:29:40,574
[SPEAKER_19]: They don't have to wear special meters or clothing or anything like that.

321
00:29:40,614 --> 00:29:42,035
[SPEAKER_19]: They just turn it off.

322
00:29:42,932 --> 00:29:45,694
[SPEAKER_19]: You also asked about the length of time you're exposed to it.

323
00:29:45,734 --> 00:29:56,660
[SPEAKER_19]: That actually doesn't matter because the light at the end, the waves are not sufficiently energetic to do any damage to you.

324
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:04,085
[SPEAKER_19]: All they do is this incredibly mild amount of heating and your body naturally dissipates that heat the way it normally does.

325
00:30:05,566 --> 00:30:09,468
[SPEAKER_19]: So it doesn't matter how long you're exposed to this stuff.

326
00:30:12,004 --> 00:30:14,066
[SPEAKER_06]: So then can you repeat the distance you said?

327
00:30:14,086 --> 00:30:16,527
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you just said it, but it would help to hear it.

328
00:30:16,808 --> 00:30:18,669
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, I didn't give a specific one.

329
00:30:18,709 --> 00:30:28,096
[SPEAKER_19]: If you're underneath a typical installation, these things are, I think the ones, all the ones we're talking about here today are 30 feet high or higher.

330
00:30:28,116 --> 00:30:30,558
[SPEAKER_19]: I was going with 20 feet high.

331
00:30:31,238 --> 00:30:32,639
[SPEAKER_19]: So, you know, a little bit closer.

332
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:35,782
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm imagining that you're within 20 feet of one of these things.

333
00:30:36,678 --> 00:30:48,983
[SPEAKER_06]: So one of the things that has come up for us in the past is that some of them, these are many are in residential neighborhoods, and some may be horizontal distance from somebody's second or third floor.

334
00:30:49,863 --> 00:30:52,044
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that was something that we were watching.

335
00:30:52,184 --> 00:31:06,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this 10 feet from the front of their house, 20 feet, 30 feet at a horizontal level, which is I think part of why we're asking, because even if it's 30 feet up, but your bedroom is only 10 feet away horizontally, you might have a concern there.

336
00:31:07,155 --> 00:31:08,676
[SPEAKER_19]: No, you're right, you're right.

337
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:18,683
[SPEAKER_19]: So these things, when you certify them to be safe, it's the closest a person can reasonably get.

338
00:31:19,144 --> 00:31:24,728
[SPEAKER_19]: So if this is 10 feet from someone's bedroom window, then it should be certified at 10 feet for being safe.

339
00:31:26,411 --> 00:31:36,979
[SPEAKER_19]: I think the communities I've worked in within the past typically have a third party engineering outfit actually certify each piece of equipment at this closest distance.

340
00:31:37,499 --> 00:31:39,361
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not sure if they do that in Medford or not.

341
00:31:40,462 --> 00:31:45,846
[SPEAKER_19]: But yeah, they should be certified for the reason of the closest reasonable distance that you can get.

342
00:31:46,686 --> 00:31:47,187
[SPEAKER_19]: By the way, 10 feet.

343
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:50,031
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, these things are very low power.

344
00:31:50,151 --> 00:32:02,299
[SPEAKER_19]: So a factor of 250 that you're below at 20 feet would reduce to a factor of about 70 below the limit when you're 10 feet away.

345
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:04,981
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's still, it's unbelievably safe.

346
00:32:05,101 --> 00:32:08,303
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not even, it's hardly even measurable, the effect of these things.

347
00:32:10,405 --> 00:32:16,969
[SPEAKER_15]: Doctor, when you say these different equipment are certified for specific distances, could you comment on

348
00:32:17,588 --> 00:32:21,469
[SPEAKER_15]: How exactly, what's the process for doing these type of certifications?

349
00:32:21,909 --> 00:32:26,390
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, the ones I've seen, again, I guess it might depend on the community.

350
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:39,993
[SPEAKER_19]: They'll hire a third party company that comes in and what they do is they take all the specifications associated with the piece of equipment, its antenna, configuration, distances to the closest houses.

351
00:32:40,033 --> 00:32:43,593
[SPEAKER_19]: They'll even take trees into account and the power going into it.

352
00:32:44,114 --> 00:32:46,094
[SPEAKER_19]: And they'll run their software to figure out

353
00:32:46,625 --> 00:32:51,687
[SPEAKER_19]: what the exposures are as a fraction of the FCC.

354
00:32:51,727 --> 00:33:01,092
[SPEAKER_19]: And there'll be some little table they give to the town engineers at the end of this.

355
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:08,335
[SPEAKER_15]: And I know in the past, in a lot of residential neighborhoods, when the poles were installed, they tried to put them at the corner of the lot lines.

356
00:33:08,355 --> 00:33:11,377
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you know if a lot of the applications we're looking at tonight

357
00:33:12,575 --> 00:33:20,400
[SPEAKER_15]: on the corners, which would be in between, usually the separation between the houses, or do we have any that are directly in front of the house itself?

358
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:20,880
[SPEAKER_15]: Do we know?

359
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,921
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be a question for Sean.

360
00:33:31,746 --> 00:33:33,067
[SPEAKER_16]: I got myself unmuted there.

361
00:33:33,107 --> 00:33:39,230
[SPEAKER_16]: So I believe the majority of these locations are in between or across the street from properties.

362
00:33:39,651 --> 00:33:41,652
[SPEAKER_16]: There might be one or two that are in front of,

363
00:33:42,165 --> 00:33:47,078
[SPEAKER_16]: directly in front of the house, but majority are in between or across the street from a residence.

364
00:33:49,776 --> 00:34:01,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Sean, you also submitted a graphic that gives some offset distances and how it relates to the percent safety, what the professor was alluding to.

365
00:34:01,738 --> 00:34:06,399
[SPEAKER_02]: The number of offsets we have are eight and a half feet, and one is 3.9 feet.

366
00:34:06,619 --> 00:34:15,901
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe one is for workers and one is, and this is just from my memory from last time, and one is for the safe zone for the general public.

367
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:20,852
[SPEAKER_02]: So do I have that right?

368
00:34:21,453 --> 00:34:22,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I interpreting that right?

369
00:34:24,694 --> 00:34:26,094
[SPEAKER_16]: Dr. Swanson, can you speak to that?

370
00:34:27,675 --> 00:34:28,575
[SPEAKER_19]: I suspect you are.

371
00:34:28,635 --> 00:34:32,716
[SPEAKER_19]: The FCC does have less stringent regulations for line workers.

372
00:34:33,176 --> 00:34:41,079
[SPEAKER_19]: It's about a factor of five, which would give you about this factor of two between the eight feet and the, I think, eight, four feet, you said, for the other people.

373
00:34:41,419 --> 00:34:42,480
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think that makes sense.

374
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:46,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was with the application package.

375
00:34:46,121 --> 00:34:47,661
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the offsets, basically.

376
00:34:48,222 --> 00:34:48,722
[SPEAKER_16]: Right, yep.

377
00:34:49,142 --> 00:34:49,622
[SPEAKER_16]: That's right.

378
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:58,904
[SPEAKER_02]: So that, yeah, and that's one of the things, you know, I was looking at is offset distances, basically making sure that we're not within that eight and a half feet.

379
00:34:59,744 --> 00:35:04,406
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll get into that in the site-specific stuff.

380
00:35:04,526 --> 00:35:09,807
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a couple of questions.

381
00:35:11,348 --> 00:35:16,109
[SPEAKER_02]: One question is, if you look at the map of how the applications are spread out,

382
00:35:17,346 --> 00:35:24,968
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's pretty clear that some neighborhoods are being focused on and other neighborhoods don't have any proposals.

383
00:35:25,469 --> 00:35:28,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you just speak to sort of the plan moving forward?

384
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:39,553
[SPEAKER_02]: How many, you know, is the plan to roll this out citywide and why, you know, why are there neighborhoods missing like North Medford, for example?

385
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:41,981
[SPEAKER_16]: So yes, I can take that.

386
00:35:42,101 --> 00:35:46,444
[SPEAKER_16]: The plan is to roll this network out citywide for sure.

387
00:35:47,004 --> 00:35:57,551
[SPEAKER_16]: And just the way that we rolled it out was just how we went into the city, did our reviews, got our stuff done and got our applications into utilities and got licensing and stuff back in that order.

388
00:35:57,591 --> 00:36:01,674
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's just the way we happen to work the city from a real estate perspective.

389
00:36:01,714 --> 00:36:04,696
[SPEAKER_16]: It wasn't like we chose any area of the city over another.

390
00:36:07,057 --> 00:36:10,380
[SPEAKER_02]: And is the plan to continue the rollout in other neighborhoods?

391
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:11,880
[SPEAKER_16]: Absolutely.

392
00:36:12,501 --> 00:36:12,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

393
00:36:14,322 --> 00:36:14,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

394
00:36:14,943 --> 00:36:25,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then, um, from the approvals that you had last round, do you have a rough percentage about how many have been installed at this time?

395
00:36:26,815 --> 00:36:34,178
[SPEAKER_16]: So yeah, at this point, about 90% of them are currently in construction and a percentage of those are fully installed.

396
00:36:34,198 --> 00:36:47,023
[SPEAKER_16]: They might not be on the air, but they're up on the pole and it takes a little bit more work behind the scenes to officially turn them on the air, but 90% of them are in construction and a good percentage of those are up on the pole at this point.

397
00:36:47,043 --> 00:36:48,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you.

398
00:36:50,485 --> 00:36:52,786
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, any other questions from committee members?

399
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:01,598
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't look like it.

400
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:06,981
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will say that we've had the opportunity to ask Verizon questions at previous hearings.

401
00:37:07,502 --> 00:37:12,384
[SPEAKER_02]: So if the public has questions for Verizon, we can certainly take those as well.

402
00:37:12,404 --> 00:37:20,129
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so unless there are any more questions from the committee, we'll go into the general non-site specific public comment portion of the hearing.

403
00:37:20,889 --> 00:37:26,472
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll open the floor to general comments not related to any specific site from the public.

404
00:37:26,792 --> 00:37:28,993
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have questions for Verizon, please go through me.

405
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:33,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold your site-specific comments until the sites come up.

406
00:37:33,495 --> 00:37:37,417
[SPEAKER_02]: First, we're going to deal with comments from email.

407
00:37:37,657 --> 00:37:46,582
[SPEAKER_02]: So Anna, if you want to address any general comments that came in via email, that would be great if we could do that now.

408
00:37:48,712 --> 00:37:49,172
[SPEAKER_08]: for Tim.

409
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:56,293
[SPEAKER_08]: So as of 6 p.m., 26 comments had been sent to the city's 5G specific comments inbox.

410
00:37:56,373 --> 00:38:14,436
[SPEAKER_08]: Five comments voiced general opposition to any 5G equipment proposals in Medford, and those included, I'm sorry, six comments, and those included comments from Leonard Hanley, street unknown, Natalia Sapita, street unknown, Tim Timerson, street unknown, M.E.

411
00:38:14,516 --> 00:38:17,697
[SPEAKER_08]: Russell, 5 Ellingport, Dave and Stacey Whitaker,

412
00:38:19,364 --> 00:38:23,347
[SPEAKER_08]: 2729 Anglehead Road and James Chambers 20 Usher Road.

413
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:25,969
[SPEAKER_08]: And then two comments voice general support.

414
00:38:26,529 --> 00:38:32,654
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are from John Siebert, 48 Vernon Street and Janice Brash, Street Unknown.

415
00:38:33,975 --> 00:38:44,122
[SPEAKER_08]: Six comments then questioned why South Medford and or East Medford had the majority of proposals and if North and or West Medford would see a similar number of proposals in the future.

416
00:38:44,783 --> 00:38:46,984
[SPEAKER_08]: And those were from Bonnie Wargo, 26 College Ave

417
00:38:48,520 --> 00:39:05,625
[SPEAKER_08]: John Sieber, 48 Vernon Street, Tom Lincoln, 27 Gleason Street, Jim Vermille, 111 Cedar Road, Stephen Chin, Ronnell Road, and Claudette Collery, 207 Main Street.

418
00:39:06,345 --> 00:39:15,608
[SPEAKER_08]: Other comments included Luke Preissner at 100 Forest Street had a concern about increasing power levels as the technology progresses,

419
00:39:16,246 --> 00:39:19,549
[SPEAKER_08]: acoustic noise from the transceivers and effect on natural foliage.

420
00:39:20,209 --> 00:39:26,194
[SPEAKER_08]: He requests that all small cell towers disclose the frequency and peak transmitter powered as required to do by law.

421
00:39:26,735 --> 00:39:42,728
[SPEAKER_08]: He requests that Verizon be limited to fans that do not produce noise over 55 decibels at 20 feet and 45 decibels heard from indoors and requests that the city required the permittee to pay for the cost of the city planting one new tree for each small cell installation.

422
00:39:44,579 --> 00:39:52,185
[SPEAKER_08]: Other questions included, could it be a condition to Verizon that they must give equal coverage to all parts of the city?

423
00:39:52,305 --> 00:39:55,327
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was from John Seaver at 48 Vernon Street.

424
00:39:56,248 --> 00:40:02,693
[SPEAKER_08]: Tim, should I pause between these for Verizon to answer those questions or should I list out all of the questions?

425
00:40:03,794 --> 00:40:05,535
[SPEAKER_02]: I think some of them they've addressed.

426
00:40:06,176 --> 00:40:12,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we can pause for a moment to see if they could address the fans and the noise question because I know

427
00:40:13,993 --> 00:40:15,593
[SPEAKER_02]: folks who are concerned about that.

428
00:40:16,334 --> 00:40:35,138
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say from the applications and the policy that, and the conditions, I think we said last time, no audible noise from the ground, but I believe they have a passive ventilation system anyway, and I will ask Verizon to address that if they can, please.

429
00:40:35,158 --> 00:40:38,299
[SPEAKER_16]: I can confirm that, Tim.

430
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:41,300
[SPEAKER_16]: There's no fans on these outdoor equipment.

431
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

432
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:56,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much, and I believe, um, I believe Mr. Conway addressed the plan that Verizon has so just to summarize and Sean please stop me if I'm incorrect or correct me that they will continue to roll out in the city of Medford.

433
00:40:58,836 --> 00:41:09,923
[SPEAKER_02]: communities like North Medford and West Medford should be seeing a similar spread of proposals for these types of antennas in the upcoming future.

434
00:41:10,303 --> 00:41:15,646
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a good way to put it, and that South Medford wasn't necessarily singled out.

435
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:21,910
[SPEAKER_02]: It's how Verizon decided to roll out their new 5G network in Medford.

436
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:26,493
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully that addresses those comments and those questions.

437
00:41:27,547 --> 00:41:31,068
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, Anna, was there any other questions that were unique?

438
00:41:31,188 --> 00:41:34,649
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we caught them all, but I wanna make sure we did.

439
00:41:35,949 --> 00:41:43,071
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a question from Natalia Cepeda that said, how can residents learn if a proposal has been approved or rejected by the committee?

440
00:41:43,831 --> 00:41:44,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, yeah, I can answer that.

441
00:41:45,912 --> 00:41:48,552
[SPEAKER_02]: So there'll be, you know, this meeting will be recorded.

442
00:41:48,612 --> 00:41:53,153
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna, you know, do that action tonight as long as we don't go past 10.

443
00:41:53,233 --> 00:41:54,214
[SPEAKER_02]: And then,

444
00:41:55,847 --> 00:42:11,615
[SPEAKER_02]: the, if you are located, one of the conditions we put it on the prior batch, I'm gonna try to put it on this batch too as a notification to the residents that live within a hundred feet that it was approved and then some basic information associated with it and a contact number for Verizon.

445
00:42:11,635 --> 00:42:17,218
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're gonna propose that same condition, I think, or I'm going to for these applications.

446
00:42:18,458 --> 00:42:21,380
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the last unique question was,

447
00:42:22,138 --> 00:42:26,162
[SPEAKER_08]: voiced by both Maria DiRemo Castagnolo and Kathleen Rourke.

448
00:42:26,803 --> 00:42:30,447
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, Maria from Thatcher Street and Kathleen Rourke from Street Unknown.

449
00:42:30,467 --> 00:42:40,358
[SPEAKER_08]: And they asked, why are more units being added in Medford, especially if a home is already within a 300 foot of a small cell 5G tower?

450
00:42:41,878 --> 00:42:42,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotcha.

451
00:42:42,158 --> 00:42:42,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

452
00:42:42,558 --> 00:42:51,940
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Verizon did touch upon that a bit, but maybe Sean, if you just want to address that specific question, I think you already did, but maybe just hone in on the answer there.

453
00:42:53,161 --> 00:42:53,281
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

454
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:59,382
[SPEAKER_16]: As Jason explained, the 5G ultra wideband network doesn't reach as far as our 4G LTE.

455
00:42:59,502 --> 00:43:03,603
[SPEAKER_16]: So when Jason showed us that map, basically that's where a 5G node is going to cover.

456
00:43:03,663 --> 00:43:06,664
[SPEAKER_16]: So we need to find another one just on the outside of that one.

457
00:43:07,004 --> 00:43:11,745
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's contiguous coverage, you know, connecting itself over and over again.

458
00:43:13,855 --> 00:43:14,715
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much.

459
00:43:16,636 --> 00:43:18,816
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Anna, whatever you get.

460
00:43:19,676 --> 00:43:20,116
[SPEAKER_08]: Excuse me.

461
00:43:20,176 --> 00:43:22,937
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all the general comments that I had.

462
00:43:23,037 --> 00:43:23,237
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

463
00:43:23,857 --> 00:43:25,317
[SPEAKER_02]: Robin, go ahead.

464
00:43:25,537 --> 00:43:33,379
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I just clarify one of the comments about the prior conditions, if that's OK with you?

465
00:43:34,419 --> 00:43:35,179
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely, please do.

466
00:43:35,239 --> 00:43:37,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm just yelling at a kid.

467
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:43,321
[SPEAKER_05]: So just to address the question of how folks will know, I believe what happened last time, obviously, is you'll take a vote publicly.

468
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:51,621
[SPEAKER_05]: And then last time the board authorized him to go ahead and get the decisions written up and they'll be filed with the city clerk.

469
00:43:52,242 --> 00:43:57,086
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the condition itself that we included last time had to do with notice prior to installation.

470
00:43:58,047 --> 00:44:03,051
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't believe we had a condition of notice of the decision itself.

471
00:44:03,691 --> 00:44:04,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you're right.

472
00:44:04,692 --> 00:44:07,835
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a good clarification, prior to installation, right?

473
00:44:07,995 --> 00:44:09,296
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not necessarily.

474
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:12,859
[SPEAKER_05]: And then a written decision will follow and it'll get filed.

475
00:44:13,546 --> 00:44:21,870
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, we can discuss conditions, you know, when you get closer to probably the first specific application, but just wanted to clarify.

476
00:44:22,751 --> 00:44:23,291
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it.

477
00:44:23,311 --> 00:44:24,031
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good clarification.

478
00:44:24,051 --> 00:44:24,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

479
00:44:24,872 --> 00:44:25,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

480
00:44:26,552 --> 00:44:26,833
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

481
00:44:28,453 --> 00:44:33,896
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we will open the floor for people who are generally in favor of the application who would like to speak.

482
00:44:33,936 --> 00:44:36,677
[SPEAKER_02]: And please, if you could limit yourself to a couple minutes, that would be much appreciated.

483
00:44:37,498 --> 00:44:38,058
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been Ken.

484
00:44:38,078 --> 00:44:42,120
[SPEAKER_09]: Did the peak transmission question get answered?

485
00:44:43,041 --> 00:44:43,941
[SPEAKER_02]: The peak transmission.

486
00:44:44,862 --> 00:44:46,263
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, there was a question.

487
00:44:48,544 --> 00:44:52,186
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, about the... I can re-read that if you'd like.

488
00:44:57,909 --> 00:45:01,311
[SPEAKER_08]: That was from Luke Prasner, 144th Street, I believe.

489
00:45:02,251 --> 00:45:08,094
[SPEAKER_08]: And he requested that all small cell towers disclose the frequency and peak transmitter power as required to do so by law.

490
00:45:08,354 --> 00:45:09,475
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that what you were talking about, Marianne?

491
00:45:12,832 --> 00:45:15,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that's what- Yes, thank you, sorry, yeah.

492
00:45:16,034 --> 00:45:20,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, so maybe if Verizon could just speak to that a little bit.

493
00:45:20,137 --> 00:45:36,108
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you guys provided a bunch of information in the applications, and I went and found some of the testing, but is that information, the information that will be included on some of the signage, or is there a different way for the public to get ahold of that information?

494
00:45:37,535 --> 00:45:44,437
[SPEAKER_03]: frequencies are all established in Verizon's licenses, so they're allowed to use whatever frequencies they're licensed to use.

495
00:45:46,298 --> 00:45:54,620
[SPEAKER_03]: The power level is really also a question of federal regulation and the equipment being used.

496
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:59,302
[SPEAKER_03]: The equipment would have a limit in terms of the power that it can

497
00:46:00,203 --> 00:46:12,951
[SPEAKER_03]: be used with and the federal regulations address the concerns that Dr. Swanson addressed in terms of power output in relation to workers and the public.

498
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:27,540
[SPEAKER_03]: But as long as it's operating within the limits set by the FCC for the radio frequency emissions and it's operating within Verizon's licensed spectrum and Verizon's allowed to operate that equipment.

499
00:46:29,302 --> 00:46:53,973
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that the question, we have a lot of very technical residents here in the city, and I don't think that the question was whether or not it was within the allowed spectrum, but whether or not Verizon would be disclosing the specific frequencies and peak transmitter power, peak, sorry, transmitter power for each one, such that a resident could in fact themselves see what it was somewhere.

500
00:46:55,653 --> 00:46:58,495
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not aware that they would do that on a site-by-site basis.

501
00:46:58,575 --> 00:47:00,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, Sean may have something to add to that, I don't know.

502
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:06,201
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't have anything further to add to that, Mike.

503
00:47:07,422 --> 00:47:11,064
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not something that we've done in the past or been asked to.

504
00:47:14,567 --> 00:47:16,068
[SPEAKER_18]: If I may, I think there

505
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:19,502
[SPEAKER_18]: maybe a little confusion with this particular question.

506
00:47:19,562 --> 00:47:26,828
[SPEAKER_18]: I think the question is generated as a result of cell towers, not necessarily small cell nodes.

507
00:47:27,429 --> 00:47:32,493
[SPEAKER_18]: So there's a different standard for cell tower, of course.

508
00:47:35,515 --> 00:47:40,799
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say, I know that the equipment gets tested and there are ranges of power output.

509
00:47:41,655 --> 00:47:46,260
[SPEAKER_02]: which are specific for the equipment based off the testing.

510
00:47:47,221 --> 00:47:51,586
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the frequencies, they are licensed and they are arranged.

511
00:47:52,227 --> 00:48:03,239
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think if we could get the range of the power output, and if we get the range of frequencies that we're operating under, I think that's what the question is asking for.

512
00:48:04,312 --> 00:48:10,878
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's good information for us to have, because if the questions are going to be answered by one person of the public, they will be asked by others.

513
00:48:11,539 --> 00:48:18,166
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would like to see if we can get that information from you guys, whether it's after a part of the condition or something like that.

514
00:48:18,446 --> 00:48:19,867
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's good information.

515
00:48:21,389 --> 00:48:22,029
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just information.

516
00:48:22,049 --> 00:48:24,271
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

517
00:48:25,892 --> 00:48:29,653
[SPEAKER_02]: With that said, let's open it up for comments.

518
00:48:29,693 --> 00:48:34,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have hands up, Anna, for public participation, for in favor?

519
00:48:36,816 --> 00:48:38,456
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see any hands up currently, no.

520
00:48:39,277 --> 00:48:47,139
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, if you'd like to speak in favor of the petitions, please use the raise hand function or put it in the chat.

521
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:48,800
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just check the chat real quick.

522
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:51,221
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just give a minute for that.

523
00:48:54,006 --> 00:48:57,068
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say there's some neutral questions in the chat.

524
00:48:58,489 --> 00:48:59,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Should I read them all?

525
00:48:59,229 --> 00:49:00,710
[SPEAKER_11]: I also do see a hand up right now.

526
00:49:02,171 --> 00:49:02,512
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yes.

527
00:49:02,612 --> 00:49:04,613
[SPEAKER_13]: I saw that video.

528
00:49:05,093 --> 00:49:06,394
[SPEAKER_13]: Paul, I'm going to ask you to unmute.

529
00:49:13,859 --> 00:49:14,419
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.

530
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:14,980
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

531
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:15,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Paul.

532
00:49:16,441 --> 00:49:16,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

533
00:49:18,925 --> 00:49:19,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

534
00:49:19,345 --> 00:49:22,387
[SPEAKER_04]: I just left a message in the chat.

535
00:49:22,467 --> 00:49:26,269
[SPEAKER_04]: My question was, when are we going to have 5G rollout in the West Medford area?

536
00:49:26,429 --> 00:49:29,391
[SPEAKER_04]: It is glaringly obvious that there's nothing there.

537
00:49:30,431 --> 00:49:32,733
[SPEAKER_04]: The coverage is spotty at best.

538
00:49:33,453 --> 00:49:41,777
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thought it was just the result of being at a higher elevation or the number of large older trees that may affect transmission.

539
00:49:41,857 --> 00:49:44,899
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know the tech behind it, but that was my main question.

540
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:46,900
[SPEAKER_04]: When are we going to get 5G in West Medford?

541
00:49:48,566 --> 00:49:49,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, thank you.

542
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:53,829
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to use the rest, we'll see if Verizon can respond with the rest of your minute, Verizon.

543
00:49:55,410 --> 00:49:57,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Sean, do you have thoughts on that?

544
00:49:58,272 --> 00:49:59,013
[SPEAKER_16]: I can respond to that.

545
00:49:59,053 --> 00:50:02,975
[SPEAKER_16]: So our plan right now is to roll the 5G network out over Medford.

546
00:50:02,995 --> 00:50:11,421
[SPEAKER_16]: I really can't talk about our future plans and where we're going next, but eventually we do have plans to cover all of Medford with the 5G ultra wideband network.

547
00:50:11,441 --> 00:50:13,142
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

548
00:50:13,242 --> 00:50:13,502
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

549
00:50:14,314 --> 00:50:17,477
[SPEAKER_02]: So no, probably not as good as you want, Paul, but... Not right.

550
00:50:18,158 --> 00:50:18,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, I know.

551
00:50:18,978 --> 00:50:24,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, if I don't mind, there's a piece of clarification that I'm actually interested in.

552
00:50:24,664 --> 00:50:31,731
[SPEAKER_06]: They're now starting to sell 5G phones and 5G cell coverage from different cell companies and

553
00:50:33,455 --> 00:50:51,349
[SPEAKER_06]: If somebody were to have some parts of Medford don't have great cell coverage today, right, with your regular 4G phone, if these were installed, does this also improve those cell phone coverages if they don't have the new 5G phones, or will only people with the 5G equipment benefit from this?

554
00:50:51,830 --> 00:50:52,390
Good question.

555
00:50:53,671 --> 00:51:01,097
[SPEAKER_16]: These cells right here will be for 5G ultra-wideband phones that are capable of using the 5G ultra-wideband network.

556
00:51:04,385 --> 00:51:12,087
[SPEAKER_06]: So we would actually need additional cell phone towers that cover 4G in order to improve the 4G coverage in the city.

557
00:51:14,588 --> 00:51:15,188
[SPEAKER_16]: Right now, yes.

558
00:51:15,308 --> 00:51:21,650
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

559
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:25,451
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to the, do we have another person with their hand up?

560
00:51:28,971 --> 00:51:30,252
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not seeing anything.

561
00:51:30,332 --> 00:51:34,754
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a reminder that people can find the hand raise function under reactions.

562
00:51:34,854 --> 00:51:37,155
[SPEAKER_08]: It should be that smiley face at the bottom of your screen.

563
00:51:37,275 --> 00:51:41,517
[SPEAKER_08]: Or if you just want to put your video on and raise your hand, I can call on you.

564
00:51:43,738 --> 00:51:47,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't we read the neutral comments from the chat?

565
00:51:47,579 --> 00:51:55,963
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a question from Kinga Brody of the transcript asking if these would add to the heat island effect.

566
00:51:59,662 --> 00:52:02,747
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think that's a question for Dr. Swanson, if he can address that.

567
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:12,302
[SPEAKER_06]: She's referring to the, you know, climate change and Yeah, so fair question.

568
00:52:13,037 --> 00:52:23,164
[SPEAKER_19]: Anything that you install in a city is going to contribute to the heat island effect and tall buildings contribute to it too because they help trap the heat in the city.

569
00:52:24,485 --> 00:52:31,969
[SPEAKER_19]: The amount of energy that's being used in these 5Gs is really very small compared to running a car.

570
00:52:32,990 --> 00:52:33,791
[SPEAKER_19]: It's nothing.

571
00:52:34,511 --> 00:52:38,554
[SPEAKER_19]: So in principle, yes, it adds to the heat island effect.

572
00:52:38,594 --> 00:52:43,578
[SPEAKER_19]: But in practice, it's so tiny that it's not even worth talking about.

573
00:52:50,202 --> 00:52:50,963
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you very much.

574
00:52:51,023 --> 00:52:52,564
[SPEAKER_20]: We have another one?

575
00:52:52,584 --> 00:52:52,764
[SPEAKER_20]: Anymore?

576
00:52:55,340 --> 00:53:04,862
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I think there is just one or two people who are asking for clarification about why we can't talk about the health concerns.

577
00:53:04,922 --> 00:53:06,943
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know that Robin explained that.

578
00:53:07,163 --> 00:53:09,043
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm wondering if it would be helpful.

579
00:53:09,483 --> 00:53:19,926
[SPEAKER_06]: And I feel like there was a question in the chat asking just for clarification and confirmation that we cannot blanketly prohibit these and we cannot put

580
00:53:22,288 --> 00:53:26,990
[SPEAKER_06]: prohibitions, we can't put rules in place that would effectively prohibit these.

581
00:53:27,290 --> 00:53:35,253
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know we discussed that at length in the spring and our other hearings, but it doesn't hurt to reiterate that, I think.

582
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:37,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

583
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:40,816
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'll take a stab at it.

584
00:53:41,976 --> 00:53:48,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, the FCC declaratory ruling is big and it's clear in a lot of ways.

585
00:53:48,999 --> 00:53:50,880
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the elements that it's very clear on

586
00:53:51,434 --> 00:54:07,312
[SPEAKER_02]: is that the municipality's purview is, you know, we're not allowed to blanket prohibit these, but we're also not allowed to create restrictions that end up fundamentally, you know, restricting these.

587
00:54:08,173 --> 00:54:09,375
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're not allowed to do that either.

588
00:54:09,932 --> 00:54:14,194
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's categories of things we're not allowed to review.

589
00:54:14,394 --> 00:54:16,995
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of them is the health impacts.

590
00:54:17,195 --> 00:54:19,896
[SPEAKER_02]: So the reason why is because it's federal law.

591
00:54:20,676 --> 00:54:21,537
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the reason.

592
00:54:22,117 --> 00:54:25,818
[SPEAKER_02]: So we will abide by federal law.

593
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:35,582
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why I said earlier today, if you have an issue with that, then please contact your state and federal representatives.

594
00:54:38,438 --> 00:54:42,921
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, now we can go into general comments against this in opposition.

595
00:54:43,302 --> 00:54:49,086
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you'd like to speak in general opposition, please use the raise hand function and we'll take you one at a time.

596
00:54:50,507 --> 00:55:00,335
[SPEAKER_11]: Tim, before we get to that one, there was another question in the chat that was, it says my bedroom window is 30 feet from the 5G cell tower.

597
00:55:00,375 --> 00:55:02,336
[SPEAKER_11]: Will these microwaves pass through my walls?

598
00:55:03,237 --> 00:55:06,840
[SPEAKER_11]: And can I put protective coverings on my windows to prevent microwaves?

599
00:55:07,875 --> 00:55:09,396
[SPEAKER_11]: like in microwave oven door?

600
00:55:12,058 --> 00:55:24,248
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will let Verizon handle that question as far as private property goes and what this person puts up that is within their freedom to do so.

601
00:55:24,949 --> 00:55:32,355
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we could have Verizon speak to the comparison to microwaves and that 30 foot distance.

602
00:55:32,735 --> 00:55:33,636
[SPEAKER_02]: So 20 to 30 feet is, you know,

603
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:44,184
[SPEAKER_02]: a pretty common offset that we're looking at with utility poles and residential dwellings here in the city of Medford.

604
00:55:44,264 --> 00:55:45,565
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, it's a good question.

605
00:55:45,965 --> 00:55:46,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

606
00:55:47,266 --> 00:55:53,749
[SPEAKER_03]: So Dr. Swanson, I think you addressed some of this earlier, but you could maybe answer that gentleman's question.

607
00:55:53,769 --> 00:55:55,550
[SPEAKER_19]: Sure.

608
00:55:55,951 --> 00:55:58,572
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, 30 feet is a nice distance.

609
00:55:58,672 --> 00:56:03,495
[SPEAKER_19]: You are probably a factor of a thousand or more below the FCC regulations.

610
00:56:05,982 --> 00:56:16,846
[SPEAKER_19]: You probably can buy material that you can put on your walls that could screen these waves of these frequencies.

611
00:56:18,086 --> 00:56:34,412
[SPEAKER_19]: But I would suggest to you to think carefully about this because the waves that are produced by the light bulbs in your house are far higher in frequency and far more intense, thousands of times more intense.

612
00:56:35,341 --> 00:56:39,985
[SPEAKER_19]: So if you're worried about the 5G, you should be much more worried about the light bulbs in your house.

613
00:56:40,686 --> 00:56:47,352
[SPEAKER_19]: Honestly, in my opinion, you would be wasting your money trying to install some sort of shielding in your house.

614
00:56:50,255 --> 00:56:50,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

615
00:56:51,516 --> 00:57:00,584
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to the first speaker, if we could, please.

616
00:57:00,664 --> 00:57:01,405
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyone raising their hand?

617
00:57:05,865 --> 00:57:09,528
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it looks like we still don't have any hand raises.

618
00:57:10,909 --> 00:57:25,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so with that said, we took care of comments, we took care of email, and now we can move on to the applications themselves.

619
00:57:25,781 --> 00:57:31,786
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so the first one is Yale Street at Dartmouth Street, so we'll give

620
00:57:33,843 --> 00:57:36,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Lisa, we'll give you a minute to find that on the map.

621
00:57:36,965 --> 00:57:39,887
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll just, while you're doing that, I'm gonna go through my measurements.

622
00:57:42,109 --> 00:57:43,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Pull the application up here.

623
00:57:43,310 --> 00:57:50,855
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so the way that this portion of the hearing is going to go.

624
00:57:50,875 --> 00:57:53,797
[SPEAKER_11]: I apologize for interrupting.

625
00:57:53,837 --> 00:57:55,038
[SPEAKER_11]: I do see one hand raised.

626
00:57:55,879 --> 00:57:56,079
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

627
00:57:57,887 --> 00:58:02,108
[SPEAKER_22]: If we want to hear that person speak, we can do it right now before we dive into the next one.

628
00:58:02,128 --> 00:58:03,808
[SPEAKER_22]: So, Susan Lee Woods.

629
00:58:03,828 --> 00:58:04,388
[SPEAKER_22]: Hello, Susan.

630
00:58:05,409 --> 00:58:06,909
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, hello, hello.

631
00:58:07,029 --> 00:58:07,669
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you hear me?

632
00:58:07,689 --> 00:58:07,729
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.

633
00:58:08,749 --> 00:58:09,249
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

634
00:58:10,410 --> 00:58:21,392
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that you said, I know that talking about health concerns is not, you're not allowed to take it into consideration.

635
00:58:22,072 --> 00:58:25,374
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe you said that we could still voice opinions about that.

636
00:58:25,995 --> 00:58:26,655
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I correct?

637
00:58:27,296 --> 00:58:27,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you can.

638
00:58:28,196 --> 00:58:30,898
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as it's not a whole bunch of people.

639
00:58:30,938 --> 00:58:33,700
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I know a lot of people in general are concerned about health impacts.

640
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:40,144
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're definitely open to hearing it and we wanna know what your concerns are.

641
00:58:40,484 --> 00:58:50,271
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so even though Dr. Swanson cited evidence as cited statistics

642
00:58:52,957 --> 00:58:54,998
[SPEAKER_01]: indicating that the safety of 5G.

643
00:58:55,398 --> 00:59:09,523
[SPEAKER_01]: Nonetheless, it's well known that there are studies showing negative impacts of 5G, cancer, cardiac and neurological issues, pregnancy and children's health.

644
00:59:10,284 --> 00:59:19,727
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want to say that I think that the fact that the federal legislation has

645
00:59:20,308 --> 00:59:26,071
[SPEAKER_01]: have forbidden us to take this health concerns into consideration is absurd.

646
00:59:26,091 --> 00:59:29,953
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that why don't we test that law?

647
00:59:30,153 --> 00:59:31,173
[SPEAKER_01]: It is absurd.

648
00:59:33,134 --> 00:59:37,976
[SPEAKER_01]: But also, why can't we have an open debate about the health risks?

649
00:59:38,457 --> 00:59:48,021
[SPEAKER_01]: Why can't we have a pro and con forum, Dr. Swenson on the one hand and the other side on the other hand, so that we could

650
00:59:49,781 --> 00:59:51,262
[SPEAKER_01]: hearing about that.

651
00:59:53,804 --> 00:59:58,427
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, can we, as Medford residents, can we test the law?

652
00:59:59,248 --> 01:00:05,412
[SPEAKER_01]: Another consideration is I believe that Lexington and Concord have been able to reject 5G.

653
01:00:05,932 --> 01:00:06,813
[SPEAKER_01]: And how did they do it?

654
01:00:07,974 --> 01:00:10,315
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the issues for me.

655
01:00:10,936 --> 01:00:11,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

656
01:00:11,616 --> 01:00:12,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Susan.

657
01:00:12,877 --> 01:00:13,517
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it.

658
01:00:14,218 --> 01:00:14,518
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

659
01:00:15,431 --> 01:00:24,518
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's hard, we just, as you know, it's not within the purview, but again, I highly recommend you contact your state and federal legislatures.

660
01:00:25,378 --> 01:00:32,944
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, I don't think that there would be anything stopping residents from trying to have some sort of debate like that.

661
01:00:34,925 --> 01:00:43,932
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and it just depends on how it's organized, who leads it, what the city's role is, but I don't think you should shy away from activities like that.

662
01:00:44,638 --> 01:00:46,199
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, for what it's worth.

663
01:00:46,279 --> 01:00:46,659
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

664
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:47,640
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

665
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:48,921
[SPEAKER_02]: You're welcome.

666
01:00:50,462 --> 01:00:50,742
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

667
01:00:51,703 --> 01:00:53,184
[SPEAKER_08]: We do now have another hint.

668
01:00:53,764 --> 01:00:55,925
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, we will take we will take Kapita.

669
01:00:56,926 --> 01:00:59,167
[SPEAKER_20]: Do I have that right?

670
01:00:59,608 --> 01:00:59,988
[SPEAKER_20]: And Kapita?

671
01:01:02,567 --> 01:01:03,627
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, hi, thank you.

672
01:01:04,207 --> 01:01:21,892
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to voice similarly to what Susan said that, well, first of all, it's not clear if the decision is going to happen now, but the way this meeting is set up, there's very little space for actually voicing really not wanting this, especially with kids in the house.

673
01:01:23,332 --> 01:01:27,413
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really worried and I'm just very upset about it.

674
01:01:27,473 --> 01:01:31,714
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know how this meeting is relevant for

675
01:01:32,246 --> 01:01:36,891
[SPEAKER_00]: those of us who opposed it at this time, it looks like it's just going to go ahead regardless.

676
01:01:37,411 --> 01:01:40,294
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to voice it and ask about the voting.

677
01:01:40,495 --> 01:01:40,835
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

678
01:01:41,504 --> 01:01:43,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, so I'll tell you about the process.

679
01:01:43,286 --> 01:01:43,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for your comment.

680
01:01:44,286 --> 01:01:47,069
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll go, we'll go through each individual location.

681
01:01:47,089 --> 01:01:47,649
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk about it.

682
01:01:47,689 --> 01:01:49,231
[SPEAKER_02]: This committee talks about the policy.

683
01:01:49,271 --> 01:01:51,813
[SPEAKER_02]: So is it ADA compliant?

684
01:01:52,494 --> 01:01:57,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it sitting on top of the pole like it's supposed to and not offset in some unsafe manner?

685
01:01:57,758 --> 01:02:00,160
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the pole structurally sound to handle it?

686
01:02:00,961 --> 01:02:05,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it roughly meet the requirements of the ADA?

687
01:02:06,367 --> 01:02:09,708
[SPEAKER_02]: not roughly, does it meet the aesthetic standards that the policy has set?

688
01:02:09,788 --> 01:02:13,610
[SPEAKER_02]: So things like that, as opposed to the health impacts.

689
01:02:13,890 --> 01:02:15,571
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, of course, I have children too.

690
01:02:15,891 --> 01:02:18,132
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know everybody's concerned about the health impact.

691
01:02:18,152 --> 01:02:25,995
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, the really the best way to get productivity out of those comments is through your public legislature.

692
01:02:26,015 --> 01:02:27,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

693
01:02:27,796 --> 01:02:29,796
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

694
01:02:30,417 --> 01:02:31,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much, by the way.

695
01:02:32,217 --> 01:02:34,438
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna we're gonna move on.

696
01:02:34,478 --> 01:02:35,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like we don't have any hands.

697
01:02:35,699 --> 01:02:35,799
[SPEAKER_02]: So

698
01:02:39,163 --> 01:02:40,884
[SPEAKER_02]: So first one, Yale Street and Dartmouth Street.

699
01:02:41,004 --> 01:02:45,267
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically what we're gonna do is we're going to discuss each location.

700
01:02:45,307 --> 01:02:52,092
[SPEAKER_02]: The committee will discuss each location and I have some measurements I'll read off and then we'll have public participation for each one.

701
01:02:52,533 --> 01:03:03,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, two minute limit and then some discussion and then we'll wait for a motion and our options are either to approve, approve with conditions or deny and we'll do one at a time.

702
01:03:03,801 --> 01:03:05,382
[SPEAKER_02]: So first one, Yale Street at Dartmouth Street.

703
01:03:05,662 --> 01:03:07,003
[SPEAKER_02]: This is on utility poll number 686.

704
01:03:09,768 --> 01:03:10,628
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, Nia.

705
01:03:11,589 --> 01:03:21,272
[SPEAKER_06]: As I'm finding that, Tim, in the past, we actually stated some blanket conditions before we went through each and every one of them.

706
01:03:21,792 --> 01:03:22,373
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

707
01:03:23,013 --> 01:03:24,854
[SPEAKER_06]: I failed to look those up myself.

708
01:03:25,314 --> 01:03:25,834
[SPEAKER_06]: I got it.

709
01:03:26,274 --> 01:03:36,138
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have them, should we read off the ones that we had before and then so that everybody knows what our bottom, like where we're, our baseline here?

710
01:03:36,889 --> 01:03:37,529
[SPEAKER_02]: But that sounds good.

711
01:03:37,749 --> 01:03:38,369
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll do that right now.

712
01:03:39,029 --> 01:03:46,551
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had about 12 general conditions and actually Verizon proactively submitted information on these 18 to eliminate a couple of them.

713
01:03:47,191 --> 01:03:50,551
[SPEAKER_02]: So for example, we had one that was, that read as follows.

714
01:03:50,992 --> 01:04:04,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Prior to installation of any small cell or related equipment, the applicant shall provide to the city engineer a certification by a registered professional engineer that the poll will safely support the new equipment as required by paragraph 2F of the policy.

715
01:04:04,934 --> 01:04:10,434
[SPEAKER_02]: So, not only did they do that for the ones that they submitted before to satisfy the condition but

716
01:04:11,442 --> 01:04:18,064
[SPEAKER_02]: This application package, these 18, have the stamped certification from a structural engineer for the locations.

717
01:04:18,505 --> 01:04:19,465
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't need that one anymore.

718
01:04:20,345 --> 01:04:38,112
[SPEAKER_02]: The next one, prior to installation of any small cell or related equipment, the applicant shall provide to the city engineer a signed affidavit from a radio frequency engineer or radio frequency safety officer with Massachusetts experience that demonstrates that the resulting radio frequency emission levels from the small cell or related equipment

719
01:04:38,572 --> 01:04:54,477
[SPEAKER_02]: to be installed pursuant hereto complies with the applicable FCC radio frequency emission regulations, as well as any Commonwealth of Massachusetts health and safety standards at the street level and at the nearest occupied building as required by paragraph 2H of the policy.

720
01:04:55,217 --> 01:05:03,979
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, Verizon did submit that information for the last applications to satisfy the condition and they included it in these applications here.

721
01:05:04,159 --> 01:05:06,160
[SPEAKER_02]: So they have that affidavit covered.

722
01:05:07,710 --> 01:05:11,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Then here are the ones that we may want to consider to continue with.

723
01:05:13,473 --> 01:05:22,638
[SPEAKER_02]: Prior to installation of any small cell or related equipment, the applicant shall provide to the city engineer updated insurance certificates as required by paragraph 2i of the policy.

724
01:05:23,099 --> 01:05:26,501
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is just because their certificate expired in June.

725
01:05:27,401 --> 01:05:31,463
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just an updated expiration date on their insurance certificate.

726
01:05:31,503 --> 01:05:34,385
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically a clerical item, a bookkeeping item.

727
01:05:35,375 --> 01:05:48,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Number four, the applicant shall pay for the costs of preparation or quote make ready work related to moving or relocating any city owned streetlights or other infrastructure related to the installation of any small cell or related equipment.

728
01:05:52,227 --> 01:05:57,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Number five, installation of any small cell or related equipment on double poles is strictly prohibited.

729
01:05:58,129 --> 01:06:10,534
[SPEAKER_02]: If a new or replacement pole is installed in the future to accommodate that equipment, the applicant will remove or cause the removal of the old pole prior to installing any small cell or related equipment on the new or replacement pole.

730
01:06:11,596 --> 01:06:33,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Number six, prior to installation of any small cell or related equipment on the pole, the applicant shall document and submit to the city engineer field measurements that demonstrate the horizontal and vertical clearances of any small cell or related equipment and of the existing pole or replacement pole, if any, are in compliance with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act and applicable Massachusetts regulations.

731
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:40,961
[SPEAKER_02]: So they did provide a summary table that provides these offsets, but I found one that was off

732
01:06:41,820 --> 01:06:52,335
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that this is a good one to have in there to make sure that those measurements happen, even though I double checked them.

733
01:06:54,515 --> 01:07:06,503
[SPEAKER_02]: So then number eight was prior to installation of any small cell related equipment, the applicant shall provide to the city engineer a signed affidavit certifying that it will one, maintain that equipment in good repair and according to the FCC standards.

734
01:07:07,103 --> 01:07:14,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Two, remove any such equipment that is not in good repair or not in use within 30 days of being no longer in good repair or no longer in use.

735
01:07:14,708 --> 01:07:20,172
[SPEAKER_02]: And three, in fact, keep that equipment in good repair and in accordance with FCC standards.

736
01:07:20,932 --> 01:07:21,052
[SPEAKER_02]: So,

737
01:07:21,993 --> 01:07:28,020
[SPEAKER_02]: They included that affidavit in the applications as well this time, so we can probably strike that condition as well.

738
01:07:28,981 --> 01:07:36,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Number nine, prior to installation of any small cell or related equipment, the ground surface at the base of the pole must be in or restored to good condition.

739
01:07:36,710 --> 01:07:38,993
[SPEAKER_02]: This includes repairing concrete sidewalk to city standards.

740
01:07:39,554 --> 01:07:40,555
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to recommend that one stay there.

741
01:07:40,575 --> 01:07:42,257
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a few of these that need cleanup and concrete.

742
01:07:43,396 --> 01:07:59,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Number 10, the applicant shall complete installation of the small cell and related equipment within one year of the date hereof, failing which this approval shall expire and a new application and approval will be necessary before any small cell or related equipment may be installed on the pole or used at this location.

743
01:07:59,794 --> 01:08:04,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Upon request of the applicant, the committee may approve one extension of that time period not to exceed six months.

744
01:08:05,468 --> 01:08:16,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Number 11, a minimum of 30 days prior to installation of any small cell or related equipment on the pole, the applicant shall provide written notice of the intended installation to abutters within 100 feet of the intended installation.

745
01:08:17,194 --> 01:08:30,380
[SPEAKER_02]: The notice shall include information about the work to be done, the type of equipment to be installed, and a description of the applicable standards that the equipment complies with, and contact information to reach the applicant in the event there is a problem or an issue with the functioning of the equipment.

746
01:08:31,628 --> 01:08:40,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Number 12, the applicant shall comply with the policy and any additional applicable state, local, and federal requirements, including but not limited to obtaining an electrical permit.

747
01:08:42,710 --> 01:08:53,033
[SPEAKER_02]: So those were the 12 conditions, and it looks like, in my opinion, we can strike number one, number two, and number eight, because they have provided that information ahead of time.

748
01:08:55,833 --> 01:08:58,454
[SPEAKER_11]: Tim, there is one item in the chat for clarification.

749
01:08:59,353 --> 01:09:08,358
[SPEAKER_11]: The request is please define what a cell tower is as opposed to a 5G mini transmitter, if my terminology is correct, and the power output of each.

750
01:09:12,460 --> 01:09:21,525
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're asking what's the difference between a cell tower and a small cell installation and what are the differences in the power output of each one?

751
01:09:21,545 --> 01:09:26,008
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's a Dr. Swanson question or Jason Flanagan.

752
01:09:26,808 --> 01:09:29,291
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, yeah, guys and if you guys have an answer for that, that'd be good.

753
01:09:31,734 --> 01:09:34,117
[SPEAKER_19]: I can say something and maybe Jason can correct me.

754
01:09:35,579 --> 01:09:42,287
[SPEAKER_19]: There's no specific answer to these because each installation is different but I can give you typical numbers.

755
01:09:43,066 --> 01:09:49,110
[SPEAKER_19]: A typical tower will operate at, say, 200 watts or 400 watts.

756
01:09:49,550 --> 01:09:57,094
[SPEAKER_19]: And just for comparison, my laptop is probably about 200 watts or four old-fashioned light bulbs.

757
01:09:58,235 --> 01:10:05,219
[SPEAKER_19]: The small g also varies, but it'll be down at 20 watts or 30 watts, something like that.

758
01:10:08,793 --> 01:10:13,156
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's the difference between a cell tower and a small cell installation.

759
01:10:13,176 --> 01:10:13,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

760
01:10:15,297 --> 01:10:15,898
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, sorry.

761
01:10:16,278 --> 01:10:16,618
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

762
01:10:16,638 --> 01:10:17,659
[SPEAKER_19]: I forgot to answer that part.

763
01:10:17,679 --> 01:10:20,921
[SPEAKER_19]: So the cell towers are the ones you see when you're driving along the highway.

764
01:10:21,542 --> 01:10:25,064
[SPEAKER_19]: Usually you don't notice them, but if you're paying attention, there'll be these.

765
01:10:25,804 --> 01:10:32,205
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, these metal towers that go up for 100 or 200 feet with some flat panels at the top of them.

766
01:10:32,905 --> 01:10:34,626
[SPEAKER_19]: Those are the 4G towers.

767
01:10:35,246 --> 01:10:40,207
[SPEAKER_19]: These 5G installations are very different because they're low power and they're very small.

768
01:10:40,667 --> 01:10:44,067
[SPEAKER_19]: So they're sort of the size of a toaster or something like that.

769
01:10:44,507 --> 01:10:47,448
[SPEAKER_19]: And you have up on the screen, it looks like a light pole.

770
01:10:47,988 --> 01:10:52,349
[SPEAKER_19]: There'd be just a sort of a toaster attached to the side of that light pole up there.

771
01:10:52,749 --> 01:10:54,209
[SPEAKER_19]: That's what a 5G would look like.

772
01:10:56,918 --> 01:11:01,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and you guys went through approximately the size of the size of a parking sign.

773
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:09,644
[SPEAKER_02]: And the few that have been installed in Medford, the committee has looked at, you know, they're, they're way up there.

774
01:11:10,724 --> 01:11:16,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually people don't really notice transformers on poles, you're probably not going to notice these, they're higher than transformers.

775
01:11:16,767 --> 01:11:18,528
[SPEAKER_02]: So once you start looking above your

776
01:11:19,634 --> 01:11:22,015
[SPEAKER_02]: eye line above your eyebrow line at the city sky.

777
01:11:22,035 --> 01:11:23,856
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll notice quite a few things.

778
01:11:24,396 --> 01:11:28,819
[SPEAKER_02]: In my personal opinion, it's ugly, but it's there.

779
01:11:29,039 --> 01:11:30,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of wires and equipment.

780
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:33,361
[SPEAKER_02]: So at least it'll blend in.

781
01:11:33,381 --> 01:11:34,622
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

782
01:11:34,682 --> 01:11:43,906
[SPEAKER_06]: Why don't I actually, I'm gonna just briefly share a photo of a 5G installation in Medford.

783
01:11:43,927 --> 01:11:45,207
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, yep.

784
01:11:45,307 --> 01:11:47,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually our first, so people understand, right?

785
01:11:49,777 --> 01:11:51,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Oops, sorry, share screen.

786
01:11:51,679 --> 01:11:54,781
[SPEAKER_06]: Take this image on my screen.

787
01:11:55,702 --> 01:12:00,025
[SPEAKER_06]: This is, in fact, in front of 200 Boston Ave.

788
01:12:00,145 --> 01:12:02,007
[SPEAKER_06]: I took this photo earlier today.

789
01:12:02,027 --> 01:12:06,691
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can see this at the very top.

790
01:12:08,592 --> 01:12:15,798
[SPEAKER_06]: And I actually would have to stop that share and share this very quickly.

791
01:12:18,336 --> 01:12:19,236
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the box.

792
01:12:19,416 --> 01:12:23,938
[SPEAKER_06]: So that crossing sign, you can even see how it's a little bent there.

793
01:12:24,458 --> 01:12:26,399
[SPEAKER_06]: These are the boxes that go behind it.

794
01:12:27,119 --> 01:12:33,262
[SPEAKER_06]: When we had our hearings in the spring, the presentation indicated this equipment would be a lot larger than this.

795
01:12:33,842 --> 01:12:37,563
[SPEAKER_06]: So it turns out that the actual installed equipment was pretty small.

796
01:12:40,924 --> 01:12:41,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Alicia.

797
01:12:41,645 --> 01:12:42,285
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very helpful.

798
01:12:43,568 --> 01:12:47,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the original proposal they had, that box was about the size of a mini fridge.

799
01:12:48,019 --> 01:12:51,768
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like a quarter of the size, so much less impactful.

800
01:12:52,336 --> 01:12:58,418
[SPEAKER_06]: I tried to grab a photo of a cell tower, but I couldn't find it that quickly right now.

801
01:12:59,118 --> 01:13:00,299
[SPEAKER_06]: Cell towers are all different.

802
01:13:00,399 --> 01:13:01,499
[SPEAKER_02]: They come in all different shapes and sizes.

803
01:13:01,559 --> 01:13:07,281
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some that look like trees, some that look like flagpoles, some that look like steel arrays.

804
01:13:07,441 --> 01:13:11,263
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's hard to pin down what a cell tower is and looks like.

805
01:13:11,543 --> 01:13:15,464
[SPEAKER_02]: But we at least know what these 5G antennas that are going up in Medford look like.

806
01:13:17,345 --> 01:13:19,686
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is the first location, if you're ready.

807
01:13:20,646 --> 01:13:22,047
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm ready I'll just read off my numbers.

808
01:13:22,447 --> 01:13:24,529
[SPEAKER_02]: So, this one at 43 feet to the top.

809
01:13:24,569 --> 01:13:27,571
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's Robin.

810
01:13:27,931 --> 01:13:43,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I just ask that, make a suggestion you can totally ignore me if you don't want to do it this way but since you just ran through the conditions and we're in the general discussion session, just to see if there are any members of the public wanted to comment on those conditions because I know ultimately, they're going to be referred to a standard conditions in your vote.

811
01:13:44,585 --> 01:13:44,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

812
01:13:44,925 --> 01:13:46,266
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yeah, that's a good idea.

813
01:13:46,286 --> 01:13:54,111
[SPEAKER_02]: If anybody in the public has any comments on those conditions, those were what were the general conditions for the last round of applications.

814
01:13:56,853 --> 01:14:02,016
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm assuming Verizon is still okay with those, but if there was anything they wanted to discuss as well.

815
01:14:04,713 --> 01:14:09,515
[SPEAKER_06]: And for the public, we were able to see you physically raising your hand in a room before.

816
01:14:10,535 --> 01:14:20,058
[SPEAKER_06]: With the shared screen up, we need you to go to the bottom of your screen and click on, it doesn't look the same on my screen.

817
01:14:20,078 --> 01:14:24,559
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm able to go between.

818
01:14:24,779 --> 01:14:25,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

819
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:26,200
[SPEAKER_13]: No problem.

820
01:14:26,220 --> 01:14:28,020
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can see people if they raise their hand.

821
01:14:28,541 --> 01:14:31,181
[SPEAKER_06]: It says reactions and you can click raise hand.

822
01:14:31,742 --> 01:14:32,942
[SPEAKER_06]: We would be able to see those.

823
01:14:36,521 --> 01:14:38,263
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a number of ways you can get our attention.

824
01:14:38,283 --> 01:14:44,130
[SPEAKER_11]: If you raise your hand on the reactions, you can also turn your video on and just show us your hand.

825
01:14:44,150 --> 01:14:46,312
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't see any hands at this point.

826
01:14:50,357 --> 01:14:52,119
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well, let's move on.

827
01:14:52,159 --> 01:14:56,504
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we get into the discussion piece, we can go over those conditions again.

828
01:14:58,538 --> 01:15:02,681
[SPEAKER_02]: confirm with Verizon that they're still okay with them or if they need to change anything or whatever.

829
01:15:02,701 --> 01:15:03,582
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll do that.

830
01:15:04,083 --> 01:15:12,069
[SPEAKER_02]: So 43 feet to the top of the pole, there's an existing permit parking sign and an existing city light on this pole.

831
01:15:12,890 --> 01:15:17,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Concrete is missing at the base and we'll need an expansion joint down there.

832
01:15:18,254 --> 01:15:24,579
[SPEAKER_02]: And it appears to meet ADA clearances and the closest dwelling is more than 75 feet away across the street.

833
01:15:24,599 --> 01:15:27,882
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so discussion questions from the committee.

834
01:15:35,035 --> 01:15:37,736
[SPEAKER_02]: have any questions or want to discuss this one at all.

835
01:15:41,897 --> 01:15:47,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to public participation, do we have any folks that would like to speak on this location?

836
01:15:47,338 --> 01:15:55,621
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure if it's a comment on this location, but in the chat there is a question.

837
01:15:56,401 --> 01:16:01,942
[SPEAKER_11]: Would some judicious tree cutting help with extending transmission range of 5G devices?

838
01:16:08,202 --> 01:16:09,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe, but I don't know if we'd allow it.

839
01:16:10,703 --> 01:16:12,384
[SPEAKER_02]: But we like our trees.

840
01:16:13,284 --> 01:16:22,267
[SPEAKER_02]: So we try to, when utility companies want to trim our trees, then they can, they have actually requirements that they have to meet and obligations for tree trimming when it comes to overhead wires.

841
01:16:22,407 --> 01:16:24,848
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not, doesn't always work out great for the trees.

842
01:16:26,473 --> 01:16:36,178
[SPEAKER_02]: So anybody who's had this happen to the house probably knows is a big V cut in the tree over time, some of the branches start to die and the trees suffers they're suffering anyway because they're urban street trees.

843
01:16:36,578 --> 01:16:45,762
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, I don't know technically if the answer to your question but I don't think that the city would want tree trimming to increase service, unless it was a real need to.

844
01:16:45,782 --> 01:16:49,764
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, hopefully that answers the question.

845
01:16:52,728 --> 01:16:54,209
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so that's the information for this one.

846
01:16:54,570 --> 01:17:00,055
[SPEAKER_02]: And so just before there's any motion, I just want to revisit those conditions again.

847
01:17:00,075 --> 01:17:05,940
[SPEAKER_02]: And the ones that remain and we'll just renumber them.

848
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:09,163
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to renumber them and

849
01:17:10,155 --> 01:17:11,516
[SPEAKER_02]: go forth and then we can talk about them.

850
01:17:11,536 --> 01:17:18,182
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so number one, basically the certificate of insurance liability is expired.

851
01:17:18,282 --> 01:17:20,244
[SPEAKER_02]: So we just need ones that aren't expired.

852
01:17:20,785 --> 01:17:31,174
[SPEAKER_02]: So prior to installation of any small cell or related equipment, the applicant shall provide to the city, the city engineer updated insurance certificates as required by paragraph two I of the policy.

853
01:17:32,315 --> 01:17:33,877
[SPEAKER_02]: That's number one, number two.

854
01:17:36,288 --> 01:17:49,955
[SPEAKER_02]: The applicant shall pay for the costs of preparation or quote make ready work related to moving or relocating any city on streetlights or other infrastructure related to the installation of any small cell or related equipment.

855
01:17:50,315 --> 01:17:54,717
[SPEAKER_02]: So an example of this one committee is when we did 200 Boston Avenue, which is the one Alicia showed us.

856
01:17:55,337 --> 01:18:06,788
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to, and I trust that they're still going to do this is take that sign off give us a new sign and put it where it's supposed to be in front of the crosswalk so in other words this condition is says that the proponent pays for that.

857
01:18:06,808 --> 01:18:09,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Number three.

858
01:18:10,757 --> 01:18:14,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Installation of any small cell or related equipment on double poles is strictly prohibited.

859
01:18:14,979 --> 01:18:27,605
[SPEAKER_02]: If a new or replacement pole is installed in the future to accommodate that equipment, the applicant will remove or cause the removal of the old pole prior to installing any small cell or related equipment on the new or replacement pole.

860
01:18:29,106 --> 01:18:30,567
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a double pole.

861
01:18:30,627 --> 01:18:34,809
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not allowed anyway, but sometimes they're in transition and there's one pole in transition here.

862
01:18:36,333 --> 01:18:51,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Number four, prior to installation of any small cell or related equipment on the poll, the applicant shall document and submit to the city engineer field measurements that demonstrate the horizontal and vertical clearances, any small cell or related equipment of the end of the existing poll.

863
01:18:52,238 --> 01:18:58,240
[SPEAKER_02]: or a placement poll, if any, on compliance with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act and applicable Massachusetts regulations.

864
01:18:59,081 --> 01:19:14,786
[SPEAKER_02]: This one came about, I think I know, this one came about because the boxes were bigger, we weren't sure exactly the clearances height wise, and we measure the width, but we wanted to confirm that the proponent was making those measurements, which is why we require that one.

865
01:19:15,627 --> 01:19:18,448
[SPEAKER_02]: So that one was number four.

866
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:29,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Number five, the new small cell or related equipment shall not create any noise detectable to the human ear at the pole location on the ground and at the nearest residence.

867
01:19:31,451 --> 01:19:33,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Number six, remember I renumbered these.

868
01:19:34,793 --> 01:19:42,739
[SPEAKER_02]: Prior to installation of any small cell or related equipment, the ground surface at the base of the pole must be in or restored to good condition.

869
01:19:42,859 --> 01:19:45,440
[SPEAKER_02]: This includes repairing concrete sidewalk to city standards.

870
01:19:46,481 --> 01:19:46,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Number seven,

871
01:19:48,082 --> 01:20:04,085
[SPEAKER_02]: The applicant shall complete installation of the small cell and related equipment within one year of the date hereof, failing which this approval shall expire and a new application and approval will be necessary before any small cell or related equipment may be installed on the pole or used at this location.

872
01:20:04,866 --> 01:20:09,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Upon request of the applicant, the committee may approve one extension of that time period, not to exceed six months.

873
01:20:11,027 --> 01:20:11,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Number eight.

874
01:20:12,315 --> 01:20:22,979
[SPEAKER_02]: A minimum of 30 days prior to installation of any small cell or related equipment on the pole, the applicant shall provide written notice of the intended installation to abutters within 100 feet of the intended installation.

875
01:20:23,399 --> 01:20:37,964
[SPEAKER_02]: The notice shall include information about the work to be done, the type of equipment to be installed, and a description of the applicable standards that the equipment complies with, and contact information to reach the applicant in the event there is a problem or an issue with the functioning of the equipment.

876
01:20:39,892 --> 01:20:48,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Number nine, the applicant shall comply with the policy and any additional applicable state, local and federal requirements, including, but not limited to obtaining an electrical permit.

877
01:20:52,621 --> 01:20:54,923
[SPEAKER_02]: So does the committee have any comments on those?

878
01:20:54,983 --> 01:20:57,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Wanna change any of those, add to them or anything like that?

879
01:20:59,426 --> 01:21:09,113
[SPEAKER_10]: No, Tim, but can I make a motion that we accept those and not have to do a review on every single application that we accept

880
01:21:10,492 --> 01:21:23,239
[SPEAKER_10]: ones that Verizon has already addressed, and that we go on that new numbered list that you have, but that we know that those going forward instead of every single application going through that.

881
01:21:23,779 --> 01:21:23,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

882
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:37,027
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it needs to be a motion, but what we can do is ask Verizon if they have any objections to those nine conditions, and we can call those our general conditions, and we can reference the general conditions for the poll locations if we want to approve with conditions.

883
01:21:38,629 --> 01:21:41,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are fine, Mr. Chairman.

884
01:21:42,851 --> 01:21:45,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the same as the last ones, and we were fine with those.

885
01:21:45,832 --> 01:21:46,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, okay.

886
01:21:46,573 --> 01:21:47,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

887
01:21:47,093 --> 01:21:52,035
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so those will be called our general conditions, those nine, and we'll move forward like that with that language.

888
01:21:52,436 --> 01:21:55,257
[SPEAKER_02]: So, here we go.

889
01:21:55,357 --> 01:21:56,978
[SPEAKER_15]: Excuse me, just a quick question on that.

890
01:21:57,018 --> 01:22:06,382
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if we implemented this before, but do we have any requirement for Verizon to notify the committee members when they're actually starting construction?

891
01:22:06,542 --> 01:22:07,903
[SPEAKER_15]: Because as you know, we'll get

892
01:22:08,620 --> 01:22:19,128
[SPEAKER_15]: I have various calls from residents about different construction projects and they don't know if it's a building permit project or if it's a public works project in the street when they see trucks pulling up.

893
01:22:19,168 --> 01:22:23,772
[SPEAKER_15]: Do we have any notification that the community members will be getting prior to these installations?

894
01:22:25,813 --> 01:22:28,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Not in those conditions, but let me see if there's anything in the poll.

895
01:22:28,375 --> 01:22:30,177
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if we did that last time online.

896
01:22:30,990 --> 01:22:37,012
[SPEAKER_21]: There's a recertification process, and that has to happen.

897
01:22:37,032 --> 01:22:37,532
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's see.

898
01:22:38,313 --> 01:22:39,193
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think so.

899
01:22:39,213 --> 01:22:41,094
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, go ahead, Alicia.

900
01:22:41,534 --> 01:22:44,955
[SPEAKER_06]: They were supposed to notify us as the committee members.

901
01:22:45,115 --> 01:22:52,618
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe they notified somebody in the administration, pulled a permit or something, but I was not aware that they were being installed.

902
01:22:52,698 --> 01:22:59,400
[SPEAKER_06]: And that could have been on our side, but it wouldn't hurt if they had to email the four of us that they were starting.

903
01:23:00,362 --> 01:23:09,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think it's just that maybe in condition 11 that you just say they have to provide notice to the abutters and to the members of the committee.

904
01:23:09,927 --> 01:23:14,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Or I'm sorry, it's now condition eight, sorry, former condition 11.

905
01:23:14,090 --> 01:23:16,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the 100 foot one, okay.

906
01:23:16,511 --> 01:23:20,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me just read the language real quick.

907
01:23:20,153 --> 01:23:22,074
[SPEAKER_05]: If that works, unless you want something else.

908
01:23:23,135 --> 01:23:24,255
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a good suggestion, Robin.

909
01:23:24,275 --> 01:23:28,998
[SPEAKER_02]: What I wanna do is just look at the language, see if we can squeeze it in there and see if Verizon has any objections.

910
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:43,782
[SPEAKER_06]: And to be clear, I don't need a paper letter for everyone for each of 100 installations, but the email would be appreciated.

911
01:23:43,802 --> 01:23:47,563
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe we don't wrap it up into this condition, Alicia.

912
01:23:47,583 --> 01:23:56,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we just have a new condition that says prior to installation of the antennas, we're notified via email.

913
01:23:56,445 --> 01:23:57,605
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Sean could do that via email.

914
01:23:59,587 --> 01:24:02,889
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that's a problem, Mr. Chair.

915
01:24:03,010 --> 01:24:11,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Just for clarity's sake, we would provide you with one notice before we went out and started construction in a particular part of the city.

916
01:24:11,875 --> 01:24:12,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that the idea?

917
01:24:13,036 --> 01:24:23,203
[SPEAKER_03]: The way we do the notices to the public, it's more efficient to send them out at once and then they're built as they're built.

918
01:24:23,543 --> 01:24:25,545
[SPEAKER_03]: We would propose to do the same thing, I think, with...

919
01:24:26,365 --> 01:24:27,165
[SPEAKER_03]: the emails to you.

920
01:24:27,505 --> 01:24:35,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, if you ever have any questions, you can also, you know, reach out to any of us and we're happy to try to get answers for you very quickly.

921
01:24:36,168 --> 01:24:36,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

922
01:24:36,468 --> 01:24:36,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

923
01:24:36,608 --> 01:24:37,228
[SPEAKER_02]: I've reached out to Sean.

924
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:51,933
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think it's, I think it's maybe an email with a tentative schedule or a schedule, you know, when you think you're going to start that route, you know, start what applications and then when you think you'll be done.

925
01:24:53,393 --> 01:24:54,593
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that would be good information.

926
01:24:54,613 --> 01:25:00,755
[SPEAKER_02]: The other committees member, instead of getting, like Alicia, like you said, we don't want emails for every single one.

927
01:25:00,795 --> 01:25:02,115
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's going tomorrow, it's going tomorrow, whatever.

928
01:25:02,995 --> 01:25:12,317
[SPEAKER_02]: One email that says we're going to start installing in this neighborhood or this round of applications, and then we intend to complete by some date in the future.

929
01:25:12,337 --> 01:25:14,618
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that that would be helpful to me.

930
01:25:15,730 --> 01:25:15,910
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

931
01:25:15,970 --> 01:25:28,719
[SPEAKER_06]: What we're trying to avoid though, is you sent mail in September that you were starting installation and then, but then you stopped and you started again in March and you know, and then you stopped and you started again.

932
01:25:29,179 --> 01:25:29,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

933
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:33,663
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we wouldn't, you know, we're just trying to like, you're actively doing them.

934
01:25:34,243 --> 01:25:39,467
[SPEAKER_06]: And then if you stop, we would like to know that you have re re-engaged, you know.

935
01:25:39,487 --> 01:25:44,250
[SPEAKER_10]: I think one point of contact would be sufficient.

936
01:25:44,715 --> 01:25:47,316
[SPEAKER_10]: Like probably Tim would make more sense for your office.

937
01:25:47,956 --> 01:25:54,458
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think my office needs to be notified of that.

938
01:25:54,578 --> 01:25:57,919
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah.

939
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:04,342
[SPEAKER_10]: I think just one notification, if Tim wants to notify the committee, that's great.

940
01:26:04,502 --> 01:26:10,784
[SPEAKER_10]: But I don't think Verizon needs to email us all every time they stop and start and do this.

941
01:26:11,104 --> 01:26:13,805
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think we need to move on to the actual,

942
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:16,221
[SPEAKER_10]: applications at hand.

943
01:26:17,042 --> 01:26:20,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I mean, so just to cover this here.

944
01:26:22,966 --> 01:26:24,708
[SPEAKER_02]: We could do a couple of different things here.

945
01:26:24,728 --> 01:26:37,098
[SPEAKER_02]: I could just put myself on the list so every time they send out notification to the 100 feet, one goes to me, and I know, and I can email you guys, or we could have another condition that says,

946
01:26:38,198 --> 01:26:42,699
[SPEAKER_02]: when you're starting on this date, we think we're gonna end on this date.

947
01:26:43,319 --> 01:26:48,000
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they have to stop for a long period of time, they'll also let us know.

948
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:49,400
[SPEAKER_02]: We could have a condition like that.

949
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:52,581
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that's fine too.

950
01:26:52,681 --> 01:26:58,082
[SPEAKER_15]: If we get specific concerns on a specific site, we can just reach out to you and get a status update on it.

951
01:26:58,102 --> 01:26:58,922
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that would be fine.

952
01:26:59,562 --> 01:27:05,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and the contact team for Verizon has been the same basically for all these applications and they've been pretty open for questions.

953
01:27:05,955 --> 01:27:08,577
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm okay with that, if Verizon's okay with that.

954
01:27:08,937 --> 01:27:20,887
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I could get one of you guys to float that condition here, and then, well, first Verizon, do you have an issue?

955
01:27:20,907 --> 01:27:23,509
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanna make sure I understand where you ended up on that.

956
01:27:23,529 --> 01:27:28,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we notifying you, Mr. Chairman, as part of our group notification?

957
01:27:28,312 --> 01:27:28,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that the idea?

958
01:27:29,482 --> 01:27:46,507
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, I think it just notify me when you begin installing and then when you plan to end installing a group of applications, like say these 18, and then if you have to stop and it is going to be, you have to stop for multiple weeks, then we'd want to know that as well.

959
01:27:47,047 --> 01:27:50,728
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so, so just basically inform you of the schedule ahead of time, I think.

960
01:27:51,228 --> 01:27:51,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

961
01:27:52,128 --> 01:27:53,488
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's, I think that's fine.

962
01:27:53,528 --> 01:27:54,249
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and again, um,

963
01:27:56,312 --> 01:28:05,434
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, not to belabor it, but as a condition versus just as a courtesy, we're also just happy to give you that information on a, you know, courtesy basis.

964
01:28:05,734 --> 01:28:07,054
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fine if it's in a condition.

965
01:28:07,074 --> 01:28:13,756
[SPEAKER_03]: I just would urge you to not make it too specific so we get tied up in technicalities or anything like that.

966
01:28:14,096 --> 01:28:20,797
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's a condition that says we'd notify you of the intended schedule before we start construction, I think that's fine.

967
01:28:21,417 --> 01:28:23,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, yeah, and that's what I'm getting at.

968
01:28:24,918 --> 01:28:25,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you.

969
01:28:25,558 --> 01:28:30,081
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, so schedule for installation.

970
01:28:31,262 --> 01:28:39,906
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can word that condition, a general schedule of installation, including if the schedule needs to end.

971
01:28:40,647 --> 01:28:42,748
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can now word it something like that.

972
01:28:42,808 --> 01:28:44,469
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, sound good?

973
01:28:44,509 --> 01:28:45,930
[SPEAKER_02]: I would also like to move on as well.

974
01:28:46,010 --> 01:28:49,912
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that said, we have 10 conditions now, general conditions.

975
01:28:50,712 --> 01:28:53,734
[SPEAKER_02]: And do I hear a motion on this particular location?

976
01:28:56,609 --> 01:29:00,810
[SPEAKER_15]: I make a motion to approve this particular location with the standing conditions.

977
01:29:02,171 --> 01:29:02,851
[SPEAKER_23]: Do I have a second?

978
01:29:03,491 --> 01:29:03,831
[SPEAKER_11]: Second.

979
01:29:05,612 --> 01:29:07,192
[SPEAKER_23]: All right, we'll do a roll call vote.

980
01:29:07,332 --> 01:29:07,752
[SPEAKER_23]: Alicia?

981
01:29:07,772 --> 01:29:07,852
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah.

982
01:29:13,134 --> 01:29:13,494
[SPEAKER_21]: Paul?

983
01:29:14,514 --> 01:29:14,794
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

984
01:29:16,555 --> 01:29:17,115
[SPEAKER_21]: Mary Ann?

985
01:29:17,635 --> 01:29:17,875
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

986
01:29:19,836 --> 01:29:20,696
[SPEAKER_21]: And me, yes.

987
01:29:23,727 --> 01:29:25,589
[SPEAKER_02]: Brookside Parkway, which is the next one.

988
01:29:25,829 --> 01:29:28,491
[SPEAKER_02]: So that one passes with conditions or general conditions.

989
01:29:29,452 --> 01:29:30,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Brookside Parkway.

990
01:29:31,394 --> 01:29:35,458
[SPEAKER_02]: So while we're navigating to that on the map, I'll read off my measurements.

991
01:29:36,544 --> 01:29:38,084
[SPEAKER_02]: This is on utility pole 930.

992
01:29:38,805 --> 01:29:46,347
[SPEAKER_02]: So I should clarify to the height to the top of the pole and utility pole number are taken off the application and I just verified them.

993
01:29:47,087 --> 01:29:51,108
[SPEAKER_02]: So, actually didn't verify the height I didn't measure the height, but 33.7 reported to the top of the pole.

994
01:29:54,309 --> 01:29:55,850
[SPEAKER_02]: This pole has an existing city light.

995
01:29:56,371 --> 01:29:58,472
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no adjacent sidewalk.

996
01:29:58,492 --> 01:30:00,133
[SPEAKER_02]: The base needs some cleanup.

997
01:30:00,594 --> 01:30:03,416
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like there's some tillings from the augering.

998
01:30:03,436 --> 01:30:07,759
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's an existing, the existing dwelling is more than 50 feet away across the street.

999
01:30:07,979 --> 01:30:09,681
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's Brookside Parkway.

1000
01:30:09,701 --> 01:30:13,283
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't have any concerns with this one.

1001
01:30:25,643 --> 01:30:33,906
[SPEAKER_06]: Because this is Brookside Parkway and it's the poll, the address we were given is 0 Brookside Parkway, I'm having a bit of, oh, is this the one?

1002
01:30:33,966 --> 01:30:36,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Could somebody from Verizon confirm with me?

1003
01:30:36,447 --> 01:30:39,128
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, you're looking at it.

1004
01:30:39,228 --> 01:30:40,289
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

1005
01:30:40,989 --> 01:30:41,549
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the one.

1006
01:30:41,569 --> 01:30:42,870
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1007
01:30:42,950 --> 01:30:44,611
[SPEAKER_07]: Not great.

1008
01:30:54,155 --> 01:30:56,317
[SPEAKER_07]: And it looks like it's straight out of the 70s.

1009
01:30:57,678 --> 01:30:59,639
[SPEAKER_07]: There we go.

1010
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:01,701
[SPEAKER_07]: That's much better.

1011
01:31:01,721 --> 01:31:04,022
[SPEAKER_07]: That one?

1012
01:31:07,525 --> 01:31:07,925
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1013
01:31:09,827 --> 01:31:12,409
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's the existing pole, correct?

1014
01:31:13,269 --> 01:31:15,511
[SPEAKER_16]: The pole has actually been replaced at this point.

1015
01:31:16,151 --> 01:31:20,214
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not the one we're looking at, but a newer pole is now located there?

1016
01:31:20,895 --> 01:31:21,295
[SPEAKER_16]: Correct.

1017
01:31:21,315 --> 01:31:22,036
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

1018
01:31:24,670 --> 01:31:26,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, this street here is from 2012.

1019
01:31:26,511 --> 01:31:33,513
[SPEAKER_06]: No wonder I thought I was looking at something in the 70s.

1020
01:31:33,994 --> 01:31:41,176
[SPEAKER_06]: And it'll be 35 feet high, and this is the location, and it's across the street from Holmes.

1021
01:31:43,217 --> 01:31:43,597
[SPEAKER_13]: That's correct.

1022
01:31:43,697 --> 01:31:51,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, as we go through each one, Anna, I'll remind you if we had any emails on these specific addresses.

1023
01:31:51,787 --> 01:31:54,629
[SPEAKER_06]: You should speak up, we may forget to ask you each time.

1024
01:31:54,649 --> 01:32:04,374
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, actually for this one, we did have an email, but it looks like we also have the person emailed here.

1025
01:32:04,734 --> 01:32:08,256
[SPEAKER_08]: Cindy, would you be willing to speak or would you like me to read off your comments?

1026
01:32:09,737 --> 01:32:11,418
[SPEAKER_08]: You can just chat or raise your hand.

1027
01:32:16,981 --> 01:32:18,542
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, I'll read off the comments then.

1028
01:32:18,682 --> 01:32:20,303
[SPEAKER_08]: So Cindy Simas,

1029
01:32:21,605 --> 01:32:23,906
[SPEAKER_08]: resides at 205 Brookside Parkway.

1030
01:32:24,506 --> 01:32:28,567
[SPEAKER_08]: And first, she had a question of if her service will be interrupted during the upgrade.

1031
01:32:32,408 --> 01:32:33,989
[SPEAKER_16]: No, there would be no interruption in service.

1032
01:32:34,529 --> 01:32:35,109
[SPEAKER_08]: Fantastic.

1033
01:32:35,249 --> 01:32:37,650
[SPEAKER_08]: And then she had two comments.

1034
01:32:37,810 --> 01:32:41,111
[SPEAKER_08]: First, she was concerned about the effects to the environment and people's houses.

1035
01:32:42,291 --> 01:32:46,612
[SPEAKER_08]: And she also would not like any equipment to be placed on her street or that close to her house.

1036
01:32:46,692 --> 01:32:49,193
[SPEAKER_08]: So she opposes displacement.

1037
01:32:51,693 --> 01:32:52,333
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, thank you.

1038
01:32:56,776 --> 01:32:59,677
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we hear her comment.

1039
01:33:00,197 --> 01:33:02,259
[SPEAKER_06]: I think those questions were answered earlier.

1040
01:33:02,279 --> 01:33:09,522
[SPEAKER_06]: And we can't say no just because somebody doesn't want them on the street.

1041
01:33:10,283 --> 01:33:13,004
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no ADA reason not to approve this.

1042
01:33:13,064 --> 01:33:14,505
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no aesthetic reason.

1043
01:33:15,045 --> 01:33:16,466
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no distance reason.

1044
01:33:20,383 --> 01:33:20,823
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's correct.

1045
01:33:20,963 --> 01:33:24,724
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would just await a motion at this point.

1046
01:33:24,804 --> 01:33:28,825
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, it's going to go on the top of that pole and the distance from.

1047
01:33:28,845 --> 01:33:36,166
[SPEAKER_02]: 33.7 is the ground to top of pole.

1048
01:33:37,647 --> 01:33:39,087
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the height.

1049
01:33:39,127 --> 01:33:42,468
[SPEAKER_06]: And the distance to the homes is clearly further than that.

1050
01:33:42,488 --> 01:33:43,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1051
01:33:43,808 --> 01:33:43,988
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

1052
01:33:47,048 --> 01:33:49,289
[SPEAKER_06]: Move approval with our standard conditions.

1053
01:33:50,527 --> 01:33:51,187
[SPEAKER_23]: Do you have a second?

1054
01:33:53,368 --> 01:33:53,868
[SPEAKER_23]: I'll second.

1055
01:33:54,948 --> 01:33:55,208
[SPEAKER_23]: All right.

1056
01:33:55,848 --> 01:33:56,548
[SPEAKER_23]: Roll call vote.

1057
01:33:56,648 --> 01:33:56,988
[SPEAKER_23]: Alicia?

1058
01:33:57,669 --> 01:33:57,949
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1059
01:33:59,069 --> 01:33:59,329
[SPEAKER_23]: Paul?

1060
01:34:00,149 --> 01:34:00,369
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes.

1061
01:34:03,090 --> 01:34:03,510
[SPEAKER_23]: Mary Ann?

1062
01:34:08,791 --> 01:34:14,212
[SPEAKER_11]: It appears like she may be having some... Oh, internet.

1063
01:34:14,672 --> 01:34:15,212
[SPEAKER_11]: She looks frozen.

1064
01:34:15,232 --> 01:34:18,853
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to have to wait a minute.

1065
01:34:19,659 --> 01:34:30,217
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, she might be logging back in.

1066
01:34:31,319 --> 01:34:33,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Coming up on our break too, so I'm looking forward to that.

1067
01:34:43,861 --> 01:34:46,662
[SPEAKER_06]: In the spring, didn't she have a power outage during one of our meetings?

1068
01:34:46,682 --> 01:34:48,784
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, same problem, exactly, yeah.

1069
01:34:49,064 --> 01:34:52,926
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, it's just a little deja vu.

1070
01:35:09,174 --> 01:35:10,975
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to take our five minute break now.

1071
01:35:11,573 --> 01:35:14,035
[SPEAKER_06]: it's 745 and allow her to log in.

1072
01:35:14,055 --> 01:35:18,259
[SPEAKER_06]: And she doesn't get it.

1073
01:35:18,939 --> 01:35:19,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1074
01:35:20,801 --> 01:35:26,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, saving as last time brings up the ironic idea of coverage.

1075
01:35:26,646 --> 01:35:30,329
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyway, if only coverage were better.

1076
01:35:30,349 --> 01:35:33,592
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm messaging with her right now.

1077
01:35:33,652 --> 01:35:35,994
[SPEAKER_11]: And she said she lost internet.

1078
01:35:36,654 --> 01:35:39,337
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm just trying to seek clarification if it's all together or

1079
01:35:41,104 --> 01:35:43,605
[SPEAKER_11]: if she's able to log back on.

1080
01:35:43,685 --> 01:35:46,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well, maybe we'll take our five minute break now.

1081
01:35:46,265 --> 01:35:47,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Are folks okay with that, committee?

1082
01:35:48,306 --> 01:35:49,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's fine.

1083
01:35:49,026 --> 01:35:51,267
[SPEAKER_13]: It is now, just switched to 746.

1084
01:35:51,347 --> 01:35:53,548
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll meet back here at 751.

1085
01:35:53,588 --> 01:35:53,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Sound good?

1086
01:35:53,928 --> 01:35:54,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds good, sir.

1087
01:35:54,848 --> 01:35:55,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1088
01:35:55,908 --> 01:35:55,888
52.

1089
01:35:55,968 --> 01:35:56,488
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1090
01:35:56,548 --> 01:35:56,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Ready?

1091
01:36:19,233 --> 01:36:19,313
oh

1092
01:38:31,125 --> 01:38:37,367
Okay.

1093
01:41:17,081 --> 01:41:18,543
[SPEAKER_20]: Mary Ann able to make it back?

1094
01:41:18,563 --> 01:41:25,114
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't see her.

1095
01:41:46,225 --> 01:41:49,026
[SPEAKER_15]: I just sent her a text, Tim, to see what's going on.

1096
01:41:49,046 --> 01:41:57,048
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, here she is.

1097
01:41:59,609 --> 01:41:59,909
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, good.

1098
01:42:02,309 --> 01:42:02,810
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, we have her.

1099
01:42:02,830 --> 01:42:05,110
[SPEAKER_21]: Is that you, Marianne?

1100
01:42:08,171 --> 01:42:11,512
[SPEAKER_11]: And then she was going to try to enter by her cell phone, so it looks like she's still connected.

1101
01:42:33,278 --> 01:42:34,239
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1102
01:42:35,200 --> 01:42:36,141
[SPEAKER_02]: We got we got your Marianne.

1103
01:42:40,064 --> 01:42:40,624
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm here.

1104
01:42:40,644 --> 01:42:41,625
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm on my phone.

1105
01:42:42,766 --> 01:42:43,167
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, great.

1106
01:42:43,227 --> 01:42:47,690
[SPEAKER_10]: Curious that this only happens to me doing my Verizon 5g.

1107
01:42:48,431 --> 01:42:50,453
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm kidding.

1108
01:42:50,613 --> 01:42:50,993
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm kidding.

1109
01:42:54,907 --> 01:43:01,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm not sure when it cut off for you, but we opened the vote for Brookside Parkway, the roll call vote.

1110
01:43:01,232 --> 01:43:06,816
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had a yes from Alicia, a yes from Paul, and then you are up.

1111
01:43:08,097 --> 01:43:08,357
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1112
01:43:08,377 --> 01:43:09,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1113
01:43:10,399 --> 01:43:11,460
[SPEAKER_02]: And I vote yes as well.

1114
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:17,465
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's an approval with conditions for Brookside Parkway, application 24.

1115
01:43:17,565 --> 01:43:20,427
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, next one is,

1116
01:43:22,022 --> 01:43:26,523
[SPEAKER_02]: West Street, it's another zero, but it's that one.

1117
01:43:27,583 --> 01:43:28,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Pins right on it.

1118
01:43:29,844 --> 01:43:32,084
[SPEAKER_02]: This one's on utility pole 1110.

1119
01:43:33,845 --> 01:43:44,167
[SPEAKER_02]: It's reported to be 34.8 feet to the top of the pole.

1120
01:43:44,667 --> 01:43:46,227
[SPEAKER_02]: No city assets on this pole.

1121
01:43:47,107 --> 01:43:48,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Appears to meet ADA clearances.

1122
01:43:49,666 --> 01:43:52,768
[SPEAKER_02]: existing dwelling more than 50 feet away across the street.

1123
01:43:54,369 --> 01:43:55,290
[SPEAKER_02]: So there it is right there.

1124
01:44:00,893 --> 01:44:01,674
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the poll.

1125
01:44:01,734 --> 01:44:05,016
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we will take any site-specific comments.

1126
01:44:06,297 --> 01:44:10,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, is there any discussion from the committee before we go into any site-specific comments?

1127
01:44:20,270 --> 01:44:23,393
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, and do we have anybody raising their hand for this one?

1128
01:44:25,915 --> 01:44:27,896
[SPEAKER_08]: No, and there are no comments in the email either.

1129
01:44:28,917 --> 01:44:33,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so at this point we are awaiting any discussion or a motion from the committee.

1130
01:44:39,426 --> 01:44:46,332
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll make a motion to approve zero West Street pole 1110 with standard conditions.

1131
01:44:47,893 --> 01:44:48,674
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, do we hear a second?

1132
01:44:51,634 --> 01:44:52,234
[SPEAKER_07]: I second.

1133
01:44:55,015 --> 01:44:56,836
[SPEAKER_23]: All right, and roll call vote.

1134
01:44:56,916 --> 01:44:57,316
[SPEAKER_23]: Alicia?

1135
01:44:58,096 --> 01:44:58,357
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1136
01:44:59,397 --> 01:44:59,697
[SPEAKER_23]: Paul?

1137
01:45:00,437 --> 01:45:00,697
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes.

1138
01:45:02,058 --> 01:45:02,538
[SPEAKER_23]: Mary Ann?

1139
01:45:02,558 --> 01:45:07,000
[SPEAKER_23]: Uh oh.

1140
01:45:08,840 --> 01:45:10,641
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, is she a co-host?

1141
01:45:12,402 --> 01:45:13,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Mary Ann, can you hear us?

1142
01:45:13,329 --> 01:45:15,710
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, now you can, now it was unmuted, yeah.

1143
01:45:15,850 --> 01:45:17,750
[SPEAKER_10]: I couldn't unmute myself before, can you hear me now?

1144
01:45:18,271 --> 01:45:19,111
[SPEAKER_10]: I just made a comment.

1145
01:45:19,131 --> 01:45:20,231
[SPEAKER_02]: I can hear you.

1146
01:45:20,251 --> 01:45:20,771
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, yes.

1147
01:45:21,492 --> 01:45:22,232
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, okay.

1148
01:45:24,032 --> 01:45:27,653
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm a yes, so that's approved with conditions, application number 54.

1149
01:45:30,374 --> 01:45:35,216
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, 39 Charnwood Road is next.

1150
01:45:35,976 --> 01:45:38,617
[SPEAKER_02]: This is on utility pole 5099, 34.3 feet to the top of the pole.

1151
01:45:43,664 --> 01:45:45,746
[SPEAKER_02]: There's an existing city light on this pole.

1152
01:45:46,346 --> 01:45:47,748
[SPEAKER_02]: The base concrete is missing.

1153
01:45:47,768 --> 01:45:54,514
[SPEAKER_02]: It does appear to meet 88 clearances and it's 22 feet to an existing dwelling, which is two stories.

1154
01:46:05,544 --> 01:46:06,865
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the more of the typical type.

1155
01:46:21,822 --> 01:46:25,944
[SPEAKER_08]: If there are no questions from the committee, there are a few comments on this one.

1156
01:46:26,784 --> 01:46:26,944
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

1157
01:46:28,125 --> 01:46:30,265
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's three oppositions.

1158
01:46:30,486 --> 01:46:47,212
[SPEAKER_08]: There's one from Elson Ekden-Genzer at 16 Greenleaf, one from Emra Genzer at 16 Greenleaf, and then one from Carol Valenti-Passey at 18 Greenleaf Avenue, and they all oppose this on the grounds of environmental and health issues.

1159
01:46:47,232 --> 01:46:51,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and are those via email or are those via chat?

1160
01:46:52,045 --> 01:46:52,966
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are via email.

1161
01:46:53,526 --> 01:46:54,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Via email, okay.

1162
01:46:54,807 --> 01:47:04,014
[SPEAKER_02]: And do we have anybody, first, do we have anybody on the committee who would like to discuss this location before we see if there's anybody from the public?

1163
01:47:04,955 --> 01:47:09,958
[SPEAKER_06]: I just would like Verizon to confirm that the one I have on the screen is correct.

1164
01:47:10,999 --> 01:47:12,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of them are a little harder to figure out.

1165
01:47:13,561 --> 01:47:13,981
[SPEAKER_16]: That's correct.

1166
01:47:14,001 --> 01:47:14,081
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1167
01:47:14,121 --> 01:47:14,281
[SPEAKER_16]: It is.

1168
01:47:17,397 --> 01:47:21,801
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's above the height of the residential dwelling.

1169
01:47:22,021 --> 01:47:25,564
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, it's a two-story dwelling.

1170
01:47:29,366 --> 01:47:33,369
[SPEAKER_15]: It's kind of like a one and a half type of bungalow.

1171
01:47:33,810 --> 01:47:37,112
[SPEAKER_15]: Tim, what did you say the horizontal distance to that was?

1172
01:47:37,172 --> 01:47:39,874
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry, I didn't remember what you said there.

1173
01:47:39,894 --> 01:47:40,195
[SPEAKER_15]: 22 feet.

1174
01:47:40,215 --> 01:47:42,316
[SPEAKER_15]: 22 feet, okay, thanks.

1175
01:47:45,336 --> 01:47:46,817
[SPEAKER_02]: And all those measurements are approximate.

1176
01:47:46,877 --> 01:47:51,300
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did them using Google Earth.

1177
01:47:51,460 --> 01:47:53,281
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't measure all of these with a measuring tape.

1178
01:47:56,463 --> 01:48:01,106
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, I should mention to you that Verizon included these measurements as well.

1179
01:48:01,486 --> 01:48:02,747
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of these I confirmed.

1180
01:48:04,188 --> 01:48:07,350
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, do we have anybody with their hand up from the public who would like to speak?

1181
01:48:14,330 --> 01:48:15,410
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't look like there are any.

1182
01:48:16,210 --> 01:48:16,491
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1183
01:48:17,751 --> 01:48:18,451
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

1184
01:48:19,111 --> 01:48:21,772
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we will just await a motion.

1185
01:48:21,812 --> 01:48:23,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further discussion from the committee?

1186
01:48:25,793 --> 01:48:26,053
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1187
01:48:28,013 --> 01:48:30,334
[SPEAKER_06]: I move approval with our standard conditions.

1188
01:48:32,374 --> 01:48:32,494
[SPEAKER_23]: OK.

1189
01:48:32,534 --> 01:48:32,814
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1190
01:48:32,854 --> 01:48:33,415
[SPEAKER_23]: Do I hear a second?

1191
01:48:35,695 --> 01:48:36,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Second.

1192
01:48:38,436 --> 01:48:38,756
[SPEAKER_23]: All right.

1193
01:48:39,056 --> 01:48:39,956
[SPEAKER_02]: And roll call vote.

1194
01:48:40,036 --> 01:48:40,496
[SPEAKER_02]: Alicia Hunt?

1195
01:48:41,156 --> 01:48:41,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1196
01:48:43,357 --> 01:48:43,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Paul Moki?

1197
01:48:44,719 --> 01:48:44,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1198
01:48:46,659 --> 01:48:46,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1199
01:48:46,760 --> 01:48:46,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1200
01:48:46,840 --> 01:48:46,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1201
01:48:46,920 --> 01:48:47,020
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1202
01:48:47,040 --> 01:48:47,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1203
01:48:47,320 --> 01:48:47,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1204
01:48:48,040 --> 01:48:48,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1205
01:48:49,880 --> 01:48:50,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1206
01:48:50,140 --> 01:48:50,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1207
01:48:50,280 --> 01:48:50,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1208
01:48:50,380 --> 01:48:50,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1209
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:50,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1210
01:48:50,781 --> 01:48:50,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1211
01:48:50,961 --> 01:48:51,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1212
01:48:51,241 --> 01:48:52,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1213
01:48:52,921 --> 01:48:52,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1214
01:48:53,081 --> 01:48:53,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1215
01:48:53,201 --> 01:48:53,261
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1216
01:48:53,281 --> 01:48:53,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1217
01:48:53,441 --> 01:48:53,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1218
01:48:53,541 --> 01:48:53,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1219
01:48:53,861 --> 01:48:54,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1220
01:48:54,081 --> 01:48:54,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1221
01:48:54,321 --> 01:48:54,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1222
01:48:54,641 --> 01:48:54,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1223
01:48:54,801 --> 01:48:54,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1224
01:48:54,902 --> 01:48:55,142
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1225
01:48:55,162 --> 01:48:55,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1226
01:48:57,042 --> 01:48:57,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1227
01:48:57,742 --> 01:48:57,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1228
01:48:58,122 --> 01:48:58,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1229
01:48:58,842 --> 01:48:59,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1230
01:48:59,083 --> 01:48:59,183
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1231
01:48:59,203 --> 01:48:59,283
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1232
01:48:59,303 --> 01:48:59,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1233
01:48:59,523 --> 01:48:59,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1234
01:48:59,603 --> 01:48:59,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1235
01:49:13,582 --> 01:49:15,844
[SPEAKER_02]: is on utility pole 5711.

1236
01:49:17,525 --> 01:49:24,130
[SPEAKER_02]: The reported measurement at the top of the pole is 29 feet, no signs, no light, no city assets.

1237
01:49:25,431 --> 01:49:28,694
[SPEAKER_02]: The base concrete is missing and a sidewalk panel is cracked.

1238
01:49:29,574 --> 01:49:33,457
[SPEAKER_02]: So there'll need to be a new panel with an expansion joint for this pole.

1239
01:49:34,658 --> 01:49:40,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Appears to meet ADA clearances and it's 24 feet to an existing three-story dwelling.

1240
01:49:44,902 --> 01:49:53,291
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, I have it's so it doesn't make the 33 feet minimum height.

1241
01:49:53,311 --> 01:49:55,373
[SPEAKER_02]: It is 29 feet to the top of the ball.

1242
01:50:17,776 --> 01:50:22,558
[SPEAKER_10]: I object because I want the 33 feet minimum.

1243
01:50:22,858 --> 01:50:30,381
[SPEAKER_10]: Although I know our policy has a typo right now that says 10 feet instead of 10 meters, it should be 33 feet.

1244
01:50:30,461 --> 01:50:35,543
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what all the recommendations are for health and safety.

1245
01:50:35,603 --> 01:50:38,884
[SPEAKER_10]: So I will not approve of this site.

1246
01:50:41,879 --> 01:50:47,263
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, any other discussion on this one from the committee before we open up to public?

1247
01:50:48,303 --> 01:50:51,806
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to, same thing with me, Mr. Chairman.

1248
01:50:51,926 --> 01:50:54,567
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not going to approve this because of the height either.

1249
01:50:56,028 --> 01:50:56,369
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1250
01:50:58,230 --> 01:50:58,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I just be clear?

1251
01:50:59,010 --> 01:51:01,652
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not approving it for health and safety reasons.

1252
01:51:01,712 --> 01:51:02,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that what's being said?

1253
01:51:03,253 --> 01:51:08,757
[SPEAKER_03]: There is no 33 foot height minimum health and safety standard.

1254
01:51:08,797 --> 01:51:10,058
[SPEAKER_03]: We talked about that the last time.

1255
01:51:11,265 --> 01:51:15,948
[SPEAKER_03]: an actual requirement for wireless facilities or for small cells?

1256
01:51:17,089 --> 01:51:18,690
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it is for me.

1257
01:51:29,157 --> 01:51:33,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I know that we did talk about this before.

1258
01:51:34,060 --> 01:51:36,442
[SPEAKER_02]: The 10 meters did come from somewhere and

1259
01:51:40,563 --> 01:51:42,304
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know specifically where it came from.

1260
01:51:42,324 --> 01:51:44,525
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that policy is 10 feet.

1261
01:51:46,265 --> 01:51:55,009
[SPEAKER_02]: And I agree that I think the movement was the changes to 10 meters, but that's not what it says now.

1262
01:51:56,269 --> 01:52:09,735
[SPEAKER_02]: And anyway, so I'm not sure we can, I'm not sure what the grounds would be if we were to- They can file an objection if they'd like,

1263
01:52:11,527 --> 01:52:14,969
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I can clarify a bit if you if you would like.

1264
01:52:15,829 --> 01:52:16,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, if you can clarify a bit.

1265
01:52:16,910 --> 01:52:17,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1266
01:52:17,230 --> 01:52:18,731
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll move to public comment.

1267
01:52:18,851 --> 01:52:27,396
[SPEAKER_19]: And then, okay, so I believe that this figure is coming from the FCC guidance for local governments.

1268
01:52:28,336 --> 01:52:28,856
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly.

1269
01:52:29,477 --> 01:52:29,637
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

1270
01:52:29,797 --> 01:52:32,859
[SPEAKER_19]: So there is this reference to 10 meters.

1271
01:52:33,639 --> 01:52:34,720
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm just looking it up now.

1272
01:52:36,203 --> 01:52:43,765
[SPEAKER_19]: It's, there's some, unfortunately some very bad wording in the document they talk about categorically excluding certain equipment.

1273
01:52:44,626 --> 01:52:56,270
[SPEAKER_19]: And what I would mean by that is absolutely this is excluded and what they mean by it is something is excluded from further consideration, if it falls into a certain category.

1274
01:52:58,765 --> 01:53:01,686
[SPEAKER_19]: that the thing that delineates that is the 10 meters.

1275
01:53:01,726 --> 01:53:07,408
[SPEAKER_19]: So things above 10 meters are categorically excluded, meaning you don't even have to consider them.

1276
01:53:08,588 --> 01:53:13,789
[SPEAKER_19]: And what that means is that things below 10 meters are still okay.

1277
01:53:14,330 --> 01:53:17,851
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just that they need to be discussed more thoroughly.

1278
01:53:19,051 --> 01:53:21,512
[SPEAKER_19]: That's what the guidance is saying.

1279
01:53:24,706 --> 01:53:28,988
[SPEAKER_15]: So the 10 meters is an FCC recommendation, is that correct?

1280
01:53:29,689 --> 01:53:34,332
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a distance above which you don't even have to think about the equipment.

1281
01:53:34,512 --> 01:53:35,352
[SPEAKER_19]: That's what they're saying.

1282
01:53:36,153 --> 01:53:36,533
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1283
01:53:39,214 --> 01:53:51,882
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think if we're discussing earlier FCC standards, why they're safe to go in, I think we have just as much right to discuss FCC standards for why we don't want to approve any of these specific sites.

1284
01:53:57,298 --> 01:54:04,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we would just if, if the committee votes to deny it, we have to have a specific reason to deny it.

1285
01:54:05,981 --> 01:54:10,663
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have to, we have to know what that reason is.

1286
01:54:12,604 --> 01:54:16,225
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't.

1287
01:54:17,426 --> 01:54:20,327
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going by the guidelines for what they recommend for

1288
01:54:20,875 --> 01:54:26,217
[SPEAKER_10]: local municipalities, and that's all we have to go on, we don't have another leg to stand on at this point.

1289
01:54:26,797 --> 01:54:38,000
[SPEAKER_10]: So, for any of this so it makes all of this really frustrating but so the guidelines, the guidelines that they put out, at least we can adhere to that.

1290
01:54:38,760 --> 01:54:46,462
[SPEAKER_10]: And hopefully in the future amend policy that typo to to reflect the 10 meters as opposed to the 10 feet.

1291
01:54:48,986 --> 01:55:13,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so for now, I'm going to go with the guidelines that we have because it's all we have, we don't have any other, you know, these meetings make you really frustrated because there's nothing really that, you know, we, you know, just throwing it out there but we could condition it to be 33 feet high so like a pole extension or something like that.

1292
01:55:18,278 --> 01:55:20,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we'll take it for a vote and see where it lands.

1293
01:55:23,661 --> 01:55:30,784
[SPEAKER_11]: Before the committee votes, perhaps the committee could ask council to provide some guidance or provide some input.

1294
01:55:31,745 --> 01:55:34,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we can do that.

1295
01:55:36,167 --> 01:55:43,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Should we hear the public first, if there's anyone from the public, and then we'll dive into that to see if there's public that wanna speak on this one.

1296
01:55:43,371 --> 01:55:44,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Anna, we have any public?

1297
01:55:46,072 --> 01:55:47,173
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I don't see any comments.

1298
01:55:48,781 --> 01:55:56,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Chair, I'd love to hear what your counsel says, and I'd also like a chance to address it after she's spoken.

1299
01:55:56,765 --> 01:55:57,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, absolutely.

1300
01:55:57,766 --> 01:55:58,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1301
01:55:58,466 --> 01:55:59,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, totally cool.

1302
01:55:59,387 --> 01:56:08,492
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so Robin, could you give us an opinion regarding the 10 meter offset, if you have that, and the guidance, if you have one on that?

1303
01:56:11,473 --> 01:56:13,674
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, so let me just unmute myself there.

1304
01:56:15,733 --> 01:56:27,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, and I think Tim already said this, to the extent that, well, first of all, you know, we've already discussed the general concept that you can't apply local regulations to materially prohibit the services.

1305
01:56:28,482 --> 01:56:37,148
[SPEAKER_05]: But in addition to the extent that you were to deny them based on some ground, it would need to be found within your local policy.

1306
01:56:38,069 --> 01:56:44,294
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm looking at the aesthetic requirement antenna section of your local policy that does say that,

1307
01:56:45,626 --> 01:56:49,328
[SPEAKER_05]: it needs to be at least 10 feet above ground level at its lowest point.

1308
01:56:49,448 --> 01:56:51,750
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is on page three of the policy.

1309
01:56:51,770 --> 01:57:05,759
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, obviously I can't predict what would ultimately happen in a court, but it at least sounds as though you are contemplating denying this for a reason that's not stated in your local policy.

1310
01:57:06,888 --> 01:57:17,817
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, and that local policy is a typo that we've been asking to be corrected, and needs to be corrected and obviously wasn't done in time for these applications, but 10 feet makes absolutely no sense.

1311
01:57:18,278 --> 01:57:21,640
[SPEAKER_10]: And we all know that so it should be 10 meters in that policy.

1312
01:57:22,901 --> 01:57:29,947
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's not so I agree with that and we're at this point where our hands are probably tied but that needs to be addressed and addressed.

1313
01:57:31,066 --> 01:57:32,027
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, so.

1314
01:57:33,087 --> 01:57:44,055
[SPEAKER_05]: The other comment I was going to make is perhaps it's worth a discussion of the chairman suggested about whether or not it's possible to get a little bit of extra height on this poll, because it does seem like it's pretty close.

1315
01:57:45,056 --> 01:57:47,658
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a good suggestion to discuss.

1316
01:57:49,439 --> 01:57:56,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and so that is my suggestion to deal with this one.

1317
01:57:57,485 --> 01:57:58,425
[SPEAKER_02]: But Mr.

1318
01:58:00,861 --> 01:58:01,921
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all my saying that right.

1319
01:58:02,902 --> 01:58:03,702
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1320
01:58:04,422 --> 01:58:05,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, thank you for that.

1321
01:58:06,923 --> 01:58:20,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, and I'm looking at this local officials guide to RF and I do agree with Dr Swanson, that it's poorly written in a sense and it's, you know, it probably is to somebody who's not in this field.

1322
01:58:22,276 --> 01:58:24,137
[SPEAKER_03]: could be read in a lot of different ways.

1323
01:58:24,498 --> 01:58:37,065
[SPEAKER_03]: But what this is talking about is whether a tower, it's page six to seven of this document, which was published, I guess, republished in June 2nd, 2000.

1324
01:58:38,006 --> 01:58:40,647
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's pages six to seven of this document.

1325
01:58:40,767 --> 01:58:51,714
[SPEAKER_03]: And what it's talking about is what facilities are required to conduct a federal environmental assessment, an EA under the federal NEPA statute.

1326
01:58:52,379 --> 01:58:56,782
[SPEAKER_03]: And as Dr. Swanson talked about it, it uses the terms categorically excluded.

1327
01:58:56,902 --> 01:59:11,950
[SPEAKER_03]: So what it talks about is the exclusion is for facilities that by their nature are highly unlikely to exceed the guidance, the guideline limits, the FCC standards.

1328
01:59:11,990 --> 01:59:16,413
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have a few different categories of things that are categorically excluded.

1329
01:59:16,433 --> 01:59:18,034
[SPEAKER_03]: The first one, which is in the middle

1330
01:59:18,902 --> 01:59:25,227
[SPEAKER_03]: page seven, it says if all the channels operated by the licensee at a site is 1000 watts or less.

1331
01:59:25,648 --> 01:59:31,092
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we heard Dr. Swanson say that a small cell like this is something like 20 or 30 watts.

1332
01:59:31,713 --> 01:59:33,454
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll let him correct me if that's wrong.

1333
01:59:33,494 --> 01:59:37,958
[SPEAKER_03]: But the threshold here for the first category of exclusion is 1000 watts or less.

1334
01:59:38,799 --> 01:59:43,263
[SPEAKER_03]: If you are not excluded on that basis, in other words, if you're 1000 feet or more,

1335
01:59:44,278 --> 01:59:56,606
[SPEAKER_03]: then it says, in addition, a cellular facility is categorically excluded regardless of power if it is not on a building and the lowest point of the antenna is at least 10 meters above ground level.

1336
01:59:57,308 --> 02:00:07,254
[SPEAKER_03]: So it would only be if you had a thousand watts or more that you'd need to worry about whether you were categorically excluded because you weren't 10 meters above the ground.

1337
02:00:07,794 --> 02:00:15,359
[SPEAKER_03]: If you were under a thousand meters, a thousand watts, you never get to that question because you're categorically excluded anyway.

1338
02:00:16,019 --> 02:00:18,481
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how that structure is set up.

1339
02:00:19,121 --> 02:00:25,184
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I wonder, I don't know what Verizon's thought is about

1340
02:00:27,049 --> 02:00:28,431
[SPEAKER_03]: about extending the poll.

1341
02:00:29,652 --> 02:00:33,076
[SPEAKER_03]: If they're willing to do that, I guess that resolves the problem.

1342
02:00:33,356 --> 02:00:43,527
[SPEAKER_03]: If not, I guess I have another suggestion, which is maybe if you went past this one for the time being and moved on to some others, and then if we're able to close things out tonight.

1343
02:00:44,222 --> 02:00:55,190
[SPEAKER_03]: you could come back to it, but if there's going to be a continuation, which I hope there won't be, you know, this would be one to continue so we can, you know, give you more information on this if need be.

1344
02:00:55,250 --> 02:01:00,614
[SPEAKER_03]: But if the pull top works for Verizon, the pull extension, maybe that's the way to resolve this.

1345
02:01:03,276 --> 02:01:03,797
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thank you.

1346
02:01:05,670 --> 02:01:16,856
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I would ask that question to Verizon if it's possible to extend it up to at least 33.3 feet, which is 10 meters.

1347
02:01:16,876 --> 02:01:16,856
33.33.

1348
02:01:18,616 --> 02:01:19,297
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey Tim, it's John.

1349
02:01:19,637 --> 02:01:25,480
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, as a condition of approval, we would mount a pole top extension here if required, requested of us.

1350
02:01:26,500 --> 02:01:26,720
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

1351
02:01:29,542 --> 02:01:29,722
[SPEAKER_02]: So,

1352
02:01:30,965 --> 02:01:33,365
[SPEAKER_02]: With that said, we gave the public an opportunity.

1353
02:01:33,846 --> 02:01:43,147
[SPEAKER_02]: We received a response that a condition to say at least 33.33 feet or 10 meters is acceptable to Verizon.

1354
02:01:43,687 --> 02:01:50,189
[SPEAKER_02]: So any motions that the committee brings up, just please include that with our standard conditions.

1355
02:01:50,829 --> 02:01:56,970
[SPEAKER_02]: And with that said, we can have this one open for a motion.

1356
02:02:03,479 --> 02:02:09,460
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll put forward a motion to accept with the pole extension to above 33 feet.

1357
02:02:10,681 --> 02:02:11,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, do we hear a second?

1358
02:02:13,421 --> 02:02:16,142
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, sorry, Marianne, and the standard conditions as well?

1359
02:02:16,702 --> 02:02:19,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and the standard conditions as well.

1360
02:02:19,682 --> 02:02:19,802
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1361
02:02:22,303 --> 02:02:29,845
[SPEAKER_15]: Marianne, that's a minimum of 33 feet, so the specific condition you're adding to this site, correct?

1362
02:02:29,985 --> 02:02:30,285
[SPEAKER_15]: Minimum 33?

1363
02:02:30,365 --> 02:02:30,685
[SPEAKER_15]: Correct.

1364
02:02:36,058 --> 02:02:36,819
[SPEAKER_23]: Is that a second, Paul?

1365
02:02:36,919 --> 02:02:38,040
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll second it.

1366
02:02:38,480 --> 02:02:39,781
[SPEAKER_23]: Alicia seconds, okay.

1367
02:02:41,643 --> 02:02:42,523
[SPEAKER_23]: And we'll call vote.

1368
02:02:42,543 --> 02:02:42,864
[SPEAKER_23]: Alicia?

1369
02:02:43,604 --> 02:02:43,824
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1370
02:02:46,327 --> 02:02:46,587
[SPEAKER_23]: Paul?

1371
02:02:47,467 --> 02:02:47,708
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes.

1372
02:02:48,748 --> 02:02:49,289
[SPEAKER_23]: Mary Ann?

1373
02:02:50,070 --> 02:02:50,330
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1374
02:02:51,931 --> 02:02:52,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Tim?

1375
02:02:52,371 --> 02:02:54,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1376
02:02:54,793 --> 02:02:58,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Approved with standard conditions plus a condition that

1377
02:02:59,656 --> 02:03:05,380
[SPEAKER_02]: sets a minimum height of 33.33 feet, which is equivalent to 10 meters above grade.

1378
02:03:05,400 --> 02:03:18,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, the next one is Gorley Road, application number 58, utility pole 1799, 33.4 feet to the top of the pole.

1379
02:03:18,830 --> 02:03:21,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Base concrete is missing, cleanup, expansion joint.

1380
02:03:23,694 --> 02:03:27,197
[SPEAKER_02]: One city street sign, the Gorley Road street sign is on it.

1381
02:03:27,217 --> 02:03:28,778
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, that one in the corner.

1382
02:03:30,005 --> 02:03:39,529
[SPEAKER_02]: It appears to me to 88 clearances and more than 75 feet to dwellings and 35 feet to the edge of the tennis court.

1383
02:03:40,410 --> 02:03:42,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Some approximate measurements there.

1384
02:03:43,551 --> 02:03:45,672
[SPEAKER_02]: So discussion by the committee.

1385
02:03:45,692 --> 02:03:55,917
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll move approval with our standard conditions.

1386
02:03:57,333 --> 02:03:57,973
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, just hold on.

1387
02:03:58,073 --> 02:04:01,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have anyone from the public who would like to comment on this one here?

1388
02:04:04,575 --> 02:04:07,936
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see any raised hands or comments and there are no comments over email.

1389
02:04:08,897 --> 02:04:10,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'll open the floor to a motion.

1390
02:04:10,397 --> 02:04:14,498
[SPEAKER_06]: Move approval with standard conditions.

1391
02:04:16,819 --> 02:04:17,439
[SPEAKER_02]: We hear a second?

1392
02:04:18,519 --> 02:04:19,060
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll second.

1393
02:04:19,640 --> 02:04:20,740
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, go ahead.

1394
02:04:21,880 --> 02:04:22,561
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll give it to Paul.

1395
02:04:22,581 --> 02:04:23,341
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1396
02:04:23,461 --> 02:04:25,221
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll beat you, Miriam.

1397
02:04:25,842 --> 02:04:26,302
[SPEAKER_10]: That's fine.

1398
02:04:29,098 --> 02:04:30,819
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so bring it to a vote, Alicia?

1399
02:04:31,540 --> 02:04:31,780
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

1400
02:04:33,701 --> 02:04:33,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Paul?

1401
02:04:34,702 --> 02:04:34,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1402
02:04:36,103 --> 02:04:36,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Mary Ann?

1403
02:04:37,084 --> 02:04:37,324
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1404
02:04:39,125 --> 02:04:39,826
[SPEAKER_02]: And I am a yes.

1405
02:04:41,287 --> 02:04:44,969
[SPEAKER_02]: That one passes, Gorley Road, application 58 with standard conditions.

1406
02:04:45,390 --> 02:04:49,152
[SPEAKER_02]: Next one is Fleming Street, 18 Fleming Street, application number 59.

1407
02:04:57,883 --> 02:05:04,769
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so this one, utility pole 2726, 29.5 feet to the top of the pole.

1408
02:05:04,889 --> 02:05:06,791
[SPEAKER_02]: So Marianne, that one's under the 33.3.

1409
02:05:07,291 --> 02:05:16,559
[SPEAKER_02]: And then this one, I field checked this one, because it wasn't clear if it was ADA accessible, the passing around it.

1410
02:05:17,120 --> 02:05:18,401
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is actually not.

1411
02:05:19,662 --> 02:05:23,245
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you show the bottom there, Alicia, to the bottom of the pole.

1412
02:05:27,563 --> 02:05:33,807
[SPEAKER_02]: The pole is actually in the ADA walkway of the driveway apron.

1413
02:05:33,887 --> 02:05:39,490
[SPEAKER_02]: So the pole is actually an obstruction to ADA clearances for the sidewalk.

1414
02:05:40,591 --> 02:05:43,013
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is not ADA compliant, this one.

1415
02:05:44,794 --> 02:05:45,934
[SPEAKER_15]: How far are they off, Tim?

1416
02:05:45,994 --> 02:05:46,555
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you know roughly?

1417
02:05:48,255 --> 02:05:56,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yes, it's about 16 inches of clear path that's less than 2% by the pole.

1418
02:05:57,202 --> 02:06:00,165
[SPEAKER_02]: So at a pinch point, it's supposed to be 36 inches.

1419
02:06:02,467 --> 02:06:07,971
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, it's kind of hard to tell, but you can see where the driveway slopes down.

1420
02:06:08,947 --> 02:06:10,008
[SPEAKER_02]: That's more than 2%.

1421
02:06:10,528 --> 02:06:19,975
[SPEAKER_02]: So the three to four feet of sidewalk that is the walkway goes from the back of the walk to where that warp begins to slope down to the street.

1422
02:06:20,055 --> 02:06:28,921
[SPEAKER_02]: So this pole in and of itself would be considered and classified as an obstruction to the accessible route over this driveway apron.

1423
02:06:30,242 --> 02:06:32,504
[SPEAKER_02]: So this pole doesn't meet the standards of the policy.

1424
02:06:39,415 --> 02:06:45,837
[SPEAKER_02]: There's three city signs on it and one city light, and it's about 20 feet from existing dwellings right there.

1425
02:06:45,857 --> 02:06:48,058
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about equally spaced between those.

1426
02:06:48,118 --> 02:06:49,279
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, it might have been close to a little bit.

1427
02:06:49,759 --> 02:06:52,160
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them in those buildings are two stories in height.

1428
02:06:54,041 --> 02:06:54,941
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1429
02:06:54,961 --> 02:06:59,403
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess I feel like we need to ask Verizon to consider another poll.

1430
02:07:00,983 --> 02:07:02,864
[SPEAKER_06]: That one looks like it's on Tufts property.

1431
02:07:02,884 --> 02:07:05,485
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not obstructing an ADA.

1432
02:07:07,810 --> 02:07:13,494
[SPEAKER_06]: And I definitely have a problem with a pole that is an obstruction to the sidewalk that is a problem for us.

1433
02:07:15,235 --> 02:07:18,057
[SPEAKER_06]: We would prefer to have, we would like to have that pole moved.

1434
02:07:19,878 --> 02:07:22,400
[SPEAKER_06]: I see, I understand the wires.

1435
02:07:22,480 --> 02:07:29,244
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not gonna be easy for anybody to move that pole because look at all, not impossible though, but.

1436
02:07:29,264 --> 02:07:34,488
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go down the street to the left of the screen to the next pole,

1437
02:07:35,423 --> 02:07:42,430
[SPEAKER_02]: The next pole represents what a typical ADA accessible pole or a non obstructed pole would be.

1438
02:07:42,770 --> 02:07:46,994
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see between back of sidewalk and the pole is your minimum three foot clearance.

1439
02:07:47,034 --> 02:07:48,756
[SPEAKER_02]: That looks probably about closer to four or five.

1440
02:07:49,296 --> 02:07:54,201
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on our side, the camera side of the pole, it slopes down the driveway apron.

1441
02:07:54,681 --> 02:07:57,464
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's actually a better spot for a pole.

1442
02:07:58,265 --> 02:07:59,225
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the greatest, but.

1443
02:08:01,085 --> 02:08:05,129
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but at least that one actually has a walkway past it that's ADA accessible.

1444
02:08:05,670 --> 02:08:09,553
[SPEAKER_06]: And that from the pole to that fence is three feet?

1445
02:08:11,075 --> 02:08:15,399
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't measure that one specifically, but just looking at it, it looks like it's probably about four or five feet, actually.

1446
02:08:16,320 --> 02:08:16,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

1447
02:08:17,381 --> 02:08:19,263
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a good judge of distance.

1448
02:08:21,653 --> 02:08:26,278
[SPEAKER_06]: Can we ask Verizon to reconsider which poll they're using on the street?

1449
02:08:26,298 --> 02:08:37,449
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I've heard in the past all the reasons they can't use a poll and this one, it doesn't have transformers on it, it doesn't have any of those other things that have been a problem for them.

1450
02:08:39,751 --> 02:08:43,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Sean or Jason, do you know anything about this other poll?

1451
02:08:47,988 --> 02:08:50,029
[SPEAKER_16]: Harmon Zuckerman, PB – Peter Vitale PB, He, Him, His): I don't know if you could take a look at that.

1452
02:08:50,069 --> 02:08:56,192
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I think part of what our, our measurements in the field where we didn't calculate that downslope.

1453
02:08:56,272 --> 02:09:02,095
[SPEAKER_16]: So we thought that this one was in the middle of the sidewalk where that other one is to the side, leaving enough space for people to get by.

1454
02:09:02,135 --> 02:09:04,556
[SPEAKER_16]: Harmon Zuckerman, PB – Peter Vitale PB, He, Him, His.:

1455
02:09:04,556 --> 02:09:06,837
[SPEAKER_16]: : We could certainly look into this pole.

1456
02:09:06,857 --> 02:09:08,238
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1457
02:09:08,438 --> 02:09:10,919
[SPEAKER_02]: Peter Vitale PB, Humane Solutions, City of Boulder

1458
02:09:11,393 --> 02:09:20,079
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it would have to be a different application and all that, but I think... It would be six to 12 months to come back for this location.

1459
02:09:20,099 --> 02:09:24,382
[SPEAKER_16]: We have to go through applications with the utilities and have to do their surveys and all that.

1460
02:09:24,443 --> 02:09:30,067
[SPEAKER_16]: So this one goes away, it goes away for a while so we can get it refiled with the utilities and then back into you guys.

1461
02:09:30,992 --> 02:09:31,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotcha, gotcha.

1462
02:09:32,253 --> 02:09:37,517
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would say it does seem like a fine point, but ADA, there are no fine points.

1463
02:09:37,777 --> 02:09:39,118
[SPEAKER_02]: It's usually black and white.

1464
02:09:39,918 --> 02:09:42,840
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and it's definitely the poll you guys selected.

1465
02:09:42,880 --> 02:09:48,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, it is not in a spot that I can approve as far as ADA access goes.

1466
02:09:48,244 --> 02:09:55,429
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, with that said, is there anybody here from the public that would like to speak on this particular one?

1467
02:09:56,910 --> 02:10:00,593
[SPEAKER_08]: There is one comment from Cindy Simmons.

1468
02:10:01,268 --> 02:10:02,629
[SPEAKER_08]: And she said my thoughts exactly.

1469
02:10:02,649 --> 02:10:06,012
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's not good for Verizon, why is it good for people walking by?

1470
02:10:06,032 --> 02:10:06,112
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1471
02:10:07,933 --> 02:10:09,094
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1472
02:10:09,134 --> 02:10:10,836
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think this one is easy in my mind.

1473
02:10:10,896 --> 02:10:13,678
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll ask them.

1474
02:10:13,698 --> 02:10:20,384
[SPEAKER_06]: Would Verizon be willing to withdraw that one because it's not ADA compliant rather than making us vote it down?

1475
02:10:22,405 --> 02:10:25,628
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got to ask Sean if that's OK, but I think so.

1476
02:10:27,978 --> 02:10:29,038
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, that would be fine, Mike.

1477
02:10:29,418 --> 02:10:29,779
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1478
02:10:29,799 --> 02:10:30,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, there we go.

1479
02:10:30,699 --> 02:10:35,820
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Mr. Chairman, we request to withdraw this application so we can consider another poll.

1480
02:10:36,420 --> 02:10:36,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.

1481
02:10:36,601 --> 02:10:37,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

1482
02:10:37,541 --> 02:10:38,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Application withdrawn.

1483
02:10:38,261 --> 02:10:40,362
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1484
02:10:41,942 --> 02:10:49,624
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, moving on to 24 Pearl Street, application number 60.

1485
02:10:52,245 --> 02:10:53,545
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is utility poll 6053.

1486
02:10:56,508 --> 02:10:58,450
[SPEAKER_02]: 34.7 feet to the top of the pole.

1487
02:10:59,231 --> 02:11:02,673
[SPEAKER_02]: The base of the pole needs to clean up from the install.

1488
02:11:03,394 --> 02:11:07,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Loam and seed needs to be freshened up or concrete with an expansion joint.

1489
02:11:07,417 --> 02:11:08,678
[SPEAKER_02]: Either one is fine for this one.

1490
02:11:11,120 --> 02:11:19,627
[SPEAKER_02]: It appears to meet 88 clearances and there is an existing city light and it's about 28 feet from existing dwelling.

1491
02:11:20,688 --> 02:11:21,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Just three stories, you can see it there.

1492
02:11:23,230 --> 02:11:25,152
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that said, discussion by the committee.

1493
02:11:29,650 --> 02:11:30,970
[SPEAKER_06]: Am I showing the right poll?

1494
02:11:31,951 --> 02:11:33,091
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure that I am.

1495
02:11:33,111 --> 02:11:33,751
[SPEAKER_22]: I believe you are.

1496
02:11:33,771 --> 02:11:34,812
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, that one looks correct.

1497
02:11:34,872 --> 02:11:36,212
[SPEAKER_22]: That does look like the correct poll.

1498
02:11:36,833 --> 02:11:37,853
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, I can confirm that.

1499
02:11:38,693 --> 02:11:43,495
[SPEAKER_06]: I just see a fire hydrant in your images, and I'm not seeing that here.

1500
02:11:43,955 --> 02:11:44,515
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, there it is.

1501
02:11:44,555 --> 02:11:49,597
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually a matter of perspective and a chair.

1502
02:11:49,617 --> 02:11:50,978
[SPEAKER_03]: It's next to the chair.

1503
02:11:52,238 --> 02:11:54,119
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good looking hydrant right there.

1504
02:11:54,139 --> 02:11:55,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice and painted.

1505
02:12:00,167 --> 02:12:08,173
[SPEAKER_06]: So when we say this poll is 34, 35, 34.7 feet to the top.

1506
02:12:10,155 --> 02:12:15,279
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, that condition about cleaning up the base is going to apply for this one as well.

1507
02:12:15,980 --> 02:12:23,025
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of these, I think, you know, they put in new polls in anticipation of, of this, it's what it looks like anyway.

1508
02:12:24,186 --> 02:12:29,871
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyone from the public have a comment on this one?

1509
02:12:32,378 --> 02:12:43,065
[SPEAKER_08]: There is a public comment that was submitted through email on this from Claudette Callery at 217 Main Street, and she's opposed to the placement of equipment near her home.

1510
02:12:43,085 --> 02:12:44,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1511
02:12:46,967 --> 02:12:47,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much, Anna.

1512
02:12:49,689 --> 02:12:54,812
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if there's no further discussion by the committee, I can await a motion.

1513
02:12:57,434 --> 02:13:00,476
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll make a motion to approve this with standard conditions.

1514
02:13:02,633 --> 02:13:07,334
[SPEAKER_06]: And they have to clean up the, or that's part of our standard conditions.

1515
02:13:07,574 --> 02:13:08,835
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, that's part of the standard.

1516
02:13:09,555 --> 02:13:11,415
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just making a special note on this one.

1517
02:13:15,477 --> 02:13:15,837
[SPEAKER_06]: Second.

1518
02:13:20,078 --> 02:13:20,358
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1519
02:13:20,558 --> 02:13:23,999
[SPEAKER_02]: That was Alicia seconding and we'll take it for a roll call.

1520
02:13:24,039 --> 02:13:24,399
[SPEAKER_02]: Alicia?

1521
02:13:25,139 --> 02:13:25,359
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1522
02:13:27,060 --> 02:13:27,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Paul?

1523
02:13:28,300 --> 02:13:28,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1524
02:13:32,200 --> 02:13:32,480
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1525
02:13:33,841 --> 02:13:34,722
[SPEAKER_02]: And I am a yes.

1526
02:13:36,704 --> 02:13:40,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Application number 6024 Pearl Street is approved with general conditions.

1527
02:13:41,568 --> 02:13:43,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Next application is 26 Royal Street.

1528
02:13:43,850 --> 02:13:45,231
[SPEAKER_02]: It's application number 61.

1529
02:13:45,331 --> 02:13:52,717
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on utility pole 4659, 35 feet to the top of the pole.

1530
02:13:53,518 --> 02:13:56,260
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a one-way sign in an existing city light.

1531
02:13:58,171 --> 02:14:02,074
[SPEAKER_02]: It appears to meet 88 clearances, about 30 feet to the closest dwelling.

1532
02:14:02,094 --> 02:14:07,018
[SPEAKER_02]: And it could use a new one-way sign.

1533
02:14:10,161 --> 02:14:14,464
[SPEAKER_02]: So my suggestion for condition is going to be a new one-way sign on this.

1534
02:14:29,592 --> 02:14:38,094
[SPEAKER_06]: Move approval with our standard conditions and a new one-way sign on it.

1535
02:14:38,114 --> 02:14:41,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, just hold on one second.

1536
02:14:41,655 --> 02:14:46,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see if we have any people from the public who would like to speak on this one.

1537
02:14:48,337 --> 02:14:57,420
[SPEAKER_08]: We have one question submitted through email that I believe was already answered, but... Sorry, I lost it.

1538
02:14:59,434 --> 02:15:03,576
[SPEAKER_08]: Bonnie Wargo at 56 College said there's already a 5G poll.

1539
02:15:03,596 --> 02:15:04,776
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm George here on the corner.

1540
02:15:04,836 --> 02:15:06,537
[SPEAKER_08]: Why do we need another one so close by?

1541
02:15:06,917 --> 02:15:08,658
[SPEAKER_08]: But I believe that was already answered by Verizon.

1542
02:15:09,339 --> 02:15:09,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1543
02:15:09,719 --> 02:15:10,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I would agree.

1544
02:15:12,600 --> 02:15:12,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1545
02:15:12,901 --> 02:15:14,101
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Alicia, we're ready for your motion.

1546
02:15:15,862 --> 02:15:21,725
[SPEAKER_06]: Move approval with the addition of our standard conditions and a new one-way sign on the poll.

1547
02:15:22,465 --> 02:15:23,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1548
02:15:23,306 --> 02:15:27,148
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we move forward, Verizon, any objections to a new one-way sign on the poll?

1549
02:15:28,002 --> 02:15:29,763
[SPEAKER_03]: We do not object to that condition.

1550
02:15:30,223 --> 02:15:30,824
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you.

1551
02:15:31,264 --> 02:15:32,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I have a second on that motion?

1552
02:15:34,866 --> 02:15:35,447
[SPEAKER_10]: No second.

1553
02:15:36,567 --> 02:15:40,149
[SPEAKER_10]: I beat you this time, Paul.

1554
02:15:40,229 --> 02:15:41,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Quicker to the punch there.

1555
02:15:42,551 --> 02:15:45,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Marianne second and roll call vote.

1556
02:15:45,252 --> 02:15:45,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Alicia?

1557
02:15:46,353 --> 02:15:46,593
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1558
02:15:48,374 --> 02:15:48,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Paul?

1559
02:15:49,355 --> 02:15:49,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1560
02:15:52,277 --> 02:15:52,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Marianne?

1561
02:15:52,777 --> 02:15:53,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1562
02:15:54,958 --> 02:15:55,879
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm a yes as well.

1563
02:15:57,563 --> 02:16:05,868
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so 26 Royal Street, application 61 is approved with conditions, standard conditions, plus a new one-way sign to be secured to the pole.

1564
02:16:07,569 --> 02:16:16,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, next one is 40 Ashland Street, application number 63, utility pole 189, 39 feet to the top of the pole.

1565
02:16:17,495 --> 02:16:20,977
[SPEAKER_02]: There's an existing permit parking sign and an existing city light.

1566
02:16:21,878 --> 02:16:24,099
[SPEAKER_02]: Base concrete is missing, panel is cracked.

1567
02:16:24,779 --> 02:16:27,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Replace panel and expansion joint for the pole.

1568
02:16:39,505 --> 02:16:40,785
[SPEAKER_20]: Any discussion by the committee?

1569
02:16:41,646 --> 02:16:47,168
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like this was taken during, is this the pole?

1570
02:16:49,368 --> 02:16:50,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it's in transition.

1571
02:16:51,402 --> 02:16:52,463
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it a double poll?

1572
02:16:53,023 --> 02:16:56,045
[SPEAKER_06]: This photo is from November 2020.

1573
02:16:56,245 --> 02:17:01,408
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same condition that's in the application.

1574
02:17:01,488 --> 02:17:03,310
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a poll in transition.

1575
02:17:03,350 --> 02:17:07,612
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see that the old poll is on some brick pedestal there.

1576
02:17:08,413 --> 02:17:16,138
[SPEAKER_02]: And it looks like the communications companies still got to maybe do their transition.

1577
02:17:17,458 --> 02:17:18,419
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like power is done.

1578
02:17:20,873 --> 02:17:23,294
[SPEAKER_02]: This would be that double pole condition.

1579
02:17:23,414 --> 02:17:27,977
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's prohibited in the policy and we have a condition for it.

1580
02:17:28,357 --> 02:17:36,322
[SPEAKER_02]: So they would have to have this completely transitioned to a single pole and the double pole removed before they can put up the 5G equipment.

1581
02:17:36,342 --> 02:17:39,043
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is covered in one of our standard conditions.

1582
02:17:40,064 --> 02:17:43,346
[SPEAKER_10]: And when it's replaced, it would be the same height as it is now or?

1583
02:17:44,056 --> 02:17:48,078
[SPEAKER_02]: They'd have to do it to the application, which is 39 feet to the top of the pole.

1584
02:17:48,158 --> 02:17:55,002
[SPEAKER_02]: So the new pole, Marianne, is the tall one, and the old pole with the X on it is the one that they are phasing away.

1585
02:17:55,702 --> 02:17:56,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you.

1586
02:17:56,943 --> 02:17:57,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

1587
02:17:59,764 --> 02:18:01,785
[SPEAKER_06]: Marianne may be viewing these on her phone.

1588
02:18:02,446 --> 02:18:02,766
[SPEAKER_02]: I am.

1589
02:18:02,886 --> 02:18:03,406
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

1590
02:18:03,426 --> 02:18:10,990
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so let's see if there's any public comment for this one.

1591
02:18:13,715 --> 02:18:19,980
[SPEAKER_08]: There's one comment submitted through email from Tom Fitzpatrick at 38 Ashland Street.

1592
02:18:20,400 --> 02:18:22,962
[SPEAKER_08]: He's opposed to 5G open being placed near his home.

1593
02:18:25,864 --> 02:18:26,184
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1594
02:18:27,245 --> 02:18:32,809
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think folks can see there's a one-way sign and there's a no parking sign.

1595
02:18:35,551 --> 02:18:39,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Those would go back the way they are, which is OK by me.

1596
02:18:42,376 --> 02:18:45,838
[SPEAKER_02]: This one, the quality of the sign is not poor like that other one.

1597
02:18:45,918 --> 02:18:48,239
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have no issues.

1598
02:18:48,259 --> 02:18:50,741
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just waiting on a motion.

1599
02:18:55,043 --> 02:18:58,525
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll make a motion to approve this with the standing conditions.

1600
02:18:58,545 --> 02:19:02,127
[SPEAKER_10]: Second.

1601
02:19:04,002 --> 02:19:06,083
[SPEAKER_10]: and that includes the pole, obviously.

1602
02:19:06,103 --> 02:19:07,364
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

1603
02:19:07,404 --> 02:19:13,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the standard conditions require the double pole to be completely transitioned away before installation.

1604
02:19:14,149 --> 02:19:14,909
[SPEAKER_10]: And I agree too.

1605
02:19:15,670 --> 02:19:15,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1606
02:19:18,171 --> 02:19:19,272
[SPEAKER_02]: And all right, roll call vote.

1607
02:19:19,472 --> 02:19:19,852
[SPEAKER_23]: Alicia?

1608
02:19:19,872 --> 02:19:19,932
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes.

1609
02:19:22,654 --> 02:19:22,954
[SPEAKER_23]: Paul?

1610
02:19:23,895 --> 02:19:24,175
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes.

1611
02:19:25,556 --> 02:19:26,036
[SPEAKER_23]: Mary Ann?

1612
02:19:26,637 --> 02:19:26,817
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1613
02:19:29,178 --> 02:19:31,378
[SPEAKER_02]: And me, yes.

1614
02:19:31,398 --> 02:19:35,979
[SPEAKER_02]: So application number 63, 40 Ashton Street is approved with standard conditions.

1615
02:19:37,139 --> 02:19:47,281
[SPEAKER_02]: Next one is 23 Woodrow Avenue, number 65, application 65, utility pole 1554, 38.8 feet to the top of the pole.

1616
02:19:48,901 --> 02:19:52,682
[SPEAKER_02]: There's an existing city light, 20 feet to the closest structure, appears to meet 88 clearances.

1617
02:20:22,437 --> 02:20:23,617
[SPEAKER_21]: That I believe is the one.

1618
02:20:24,058 --> 02:20:25,638
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I can see the poll number.

1619
02:20:27,238 --> 02:20:29,019
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, I don't see any.

1620
02:20:29,039 --> 02:20:32,240
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no concerns.

1621
02:20:34,741 --> 02:20:36,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other discussion points from the committee?

1622
02:20:38,622 --> 02:20:39,022
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1623
02:20:39,662 --> 02:20:40,463
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll go to public.

1624
02:20:40,943 --> 02:20:42,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Any public comments on this one?

1625
02:20:42,043 --> 02:20:44,324
[SPEAKER_08]: There are no public comments on this one.

1626
02:20:45,524 --> 02:20:46,764
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so just a weight of motion.

1627
02:20:49,405 --> 02:20:51,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Move approval with their standard conditions.

1628
02:20:55,418 --> 02:20:56,038
[SPEAKER_21]: Can we hear a second?

1629
02:21:00,561 --> 02:21:02,923
[SPEAKER_11]: Second.

1630
02:21:03,003 --> 02:21:03,343
[SPEAKER_11]: Second.

1631
02:21:03,363 --> 02:21:05,004
[SPEAKER_21]: I put a P. Second.

1632
02:21:05,024 --> 02:21:05,985
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, roll call vote.

1633
02:21:06,005 --> 02:21:06,505
[SPEAKER_21]: Alicia?

1634
02:21:06,525 --> 02:21:06,645
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1635
02:21:06,805 --> 02:21:06,925
[SPEAKER_21]: Paul?

1636
02:21:06,945 --> 02:21:07,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1637
02:21:07,105 --> 02:21:07,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Mary Ann?

1638
02:21:07,646 --> 02:21:09,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1639
02:21:18,950 --> 02:21:25,273
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, application number 6523 Woodrow Avenue is approved with standard conditions.

1640
02:21:25,833 --> 02:21:29,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Next application is 163 Forest Street, application 66.

1641
02:21:31,576 --> 02:21:37,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Utility pole number is 4167, 33.4 feet to the top of the pole.

1642
02:21:37,638 --> 02:21:41,140
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a street sign, the faded seal.

1643
02:21:41,380 --> 02:21:44,321
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna recommend that that be replaced.

1644
02:21:47,278 --> 02:21:48,758
[SPEAKER_02]: The base is a mess from the auger.

1645
02:21:48,778 --> 02:21:53,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Appears to meet ADA offset clearances, 38 feet to the closest structure.

1646
02:21:53,739 --> 02:22:06,621
[SPEAKER_10]: Go ahead, Alicia.

1647
02:22:06,661 --> 02:22:07,341
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

1648
02:22:07,461 --> 02:22:12,502
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just going to say, this is the most congested pole I've ever seen the mask for so far.

1649
02:22:12,522 --> 02:22:14,683
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't look that congested.

1650
02:22:14,983 --> 02:22:15,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this it?

1651
02:22:15,723 --> 02:22:16,603
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this the right one?

1652
02:22:17,245 --> 02:22:18,606
[SPEAKER_16]: poles across the street, Alicia.

1653
02:22:19,166 --> 02:22:19,807
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1654
02:22:19,827 --> 02:22:23,029
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say, it doesn't match exactly.

1655
02:22:23,869 --> 02:22:25,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1656
02:22:26,391 --> 02:22:28,512
[SPEAKER_06]: This looks more like a pole they would choose.

1657
02:22:29,013 --> 02:22:29,893
[SPEAKER_22]: That's the one.

1658
02:22:31,194 --> 02:22:31,754
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1659
02:22:37,798 --> 02:22:40,760
[SPEAKER_10]: Tim, did you say the base was a mess?

1660
02:22:40,800 --> 02:22:42,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this is Tillings from the augering there.

1661
02:22:44,336 --> 02:22:48,019
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but they have to restore the base as a general condition.

1662
02:22:49,299 --> 02:22:55,444
[SPEAKER_06]: You mean the ground, not the poles base, not the bottom part portion of the pole.

1663
02:22:55,484 --> 02:22:56,945
[SPEAKER_06]: You mean the ground around the pole?

1664
02:22:57,565 --> 02:22:58,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, exactly.

1665
02:22:58,366 --> 02:22:58,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

1666
02:23:00,347 --> 02:23:00,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

1667
02:23:00,848 --> 02:23:03,189
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see the results of the augering there.

1668
02:23:03,950 --> 02:23:07,312
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but that's, again, that's a standard condition for them to restore that.

1669
02:23:08,613 --> 02:23:10,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Needs somebody to adopt that storm drain there.

1670
02:23:12,115 --> 02:23:12,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1671
02:23:13,395 --> 02:23:16,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and if you could see the street sign there, see that white circle?

1672
02:23:17,378 --> 02:23:20,621
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Medford's seal, so that one's faded.

1673
02:23:21,221 --> 02:23:27,767
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was suggesting if Verizon opened to it to replace that sign with a new one without a faded seal.

1674
02:23:32,691 --> 02:23:34,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you guys have any objection to that?

1675
02:23:35,293 --> 02:23:37,215
[SPEAKER_03]: We can do that, Mr. Chairman.

1676
02:23:37,235 --> 02:23:37,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1677
02:23:37,835 --> 02:23:40,898
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so with that said, do we have public comment on this?

1678
02:23:45,221 --> 02:23:49,603
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, yes, there are a few public comments on this that came through email.

1679
02:23:51,605 --> 02:23:57,268
[SPEAKER_08]: We have three comments opposing replacement of the 5G tower near people's homes.

1680
02:23:57,688 --> 02:24:08,574
[SPEAKER_08]: Arianna Chappin from 67 Clifton Street, Joseph Twomey from 67 Clifton Street, and Jim and Anne Girolamo from Grover Circle.

1681
02:24:10,055 --> 02:24:10,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you, Anna.

1682
02:24:12,216 --> 02:24:13,277
[SPEAKER_22]: Anybody here wish to speak?

1683
02:24:13,317 --> 02:24:13,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Any hands up?

1684
02:24:17,570 --> 02:24:18,551
[SPEAKER_20]: No, okay.

1685
02:24:20,172 --> 02:24:25,357
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, with that said, unless there's further discussion, the floor is open for a motion from the committee.

1686
02:24:28,520 --> 02:24:40,230
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would say in the motion, please reference standard conditions plus condition specific to replace the street sign with a new one, the Forest Street sign.

1687
02:24:40,844 --> 02:24:49,047
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to acknowledge that we hear that the residents don't want it, but there are no grounds for us to deny this location regardless.

1688
02:24:50,127 --> 02:24:50,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1689
02:24:51,728 --> 02:24:59,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Make a motion to approve it with the condition of replacing the forest street nine with a new, new one.

1690
02:24:59,350 --> 02:25:02,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and our standard conditions.

1691
02:25:05,092 --> 02:25:06,252
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll second that motion.

1692
02:25:06,273 --> 02:25:10,694
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Paul.

1693
02:25:13,098 --> 02:25:14,459
[SPEAKER_23]: And roll call vote, Alicia?

1694
02:25:14,479 --> 02:25:15,499
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1695
02:25:17,040 --> 02:25:17,260
[SPEAKER_23]: Paul?

1696
02:25:18,201 --> 02:25:18,461
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes.

1697
02:25:19,401 --> 02:25:19,841
[SPEAKER_23]: Mary Ann?

1698
02:25:20,742 --> 02:25:20,962
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes.

1699
02:25:22,723 --> 02:25:23,383
[SPEAKER_02]: And me, yes.

1700
02:25:25,064 --> 02:25:38,330
[SPEAKER_02]: So 163 Forest Street, application 66 passes with conditions, standard conditions, plus a new Forest Street sign with a seal, city seal, okay.

1701
02:25:42,750 --> 02:25:45,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Next one is 199 Forest Street, application number 67.

1702
02:25:47,755 --> 02:25:50,158
[SPEAKER_02]: The pole is actually on Valley Street, right around the corner.

1703
02:25:50,178 --> 02:25:52,761
[SPEAKER_02]: It's utility pole 1834.

1704
02:25:53,642 --> 02:25:57,265
[SPEAKER_02]: The top of the pole is reported at 34.8 feet.

1705
02:25:57,986 --> 02:26:00,629
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no signs, but there is a light on this one.

1706
02:26:00,649 --> 02:26:04,553
[SPEAKER_02]: And the base needs an expansion joint.

1707
02:26:05,007 --> 02:26:06,108
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no expansion joint.

1708
02:26:06,688 --> 02:26:09,290
[SPEAKER_02]: And that one actually, we should zoom in on it to see, yeah.

1709
02:26:09,911 --> 02:26:13,133
[SPEAKER_02]: So that one, the concrete looks fine, but there's no expansion joint.

1710
02:26:13,153 --> 02:26:17,236
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm gonna suggest that as a condition that an expansion joint be installed.

1711
02:26:18,798 --> 02:26:25,843
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's to protect the rest of the concrete panel around it if it shifts, which they do.

1712
02:26:27,364 --> 02:26:29,226
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's gonna be my suggestion for this one.

1713
02:26:29,246 --> 02:26:31,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have any other discussion from the committee?

1714
02:26:37,185 --> 02:26:40,366
[SPEAKER_06]: I assume there's no problem with the ADA compliance.

1715
02:26:41,006 --> 02:26:44,207
[SPEAKER_06]: It's right at the car also, but it's not obstructing it in any way.

1716
02:26:44,227 --> 02:26:44,987
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that correct?

1717
02:26:45,888 --> 02:26:46,788
[SPEAKER_02]: That is correct.

1718
02:26:46,828 --> 02:26:51,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's not obstructing the passageway of the walkway. 34.8.

1719
02:27:09,818 --> 02:27:11,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Any comments from the public?

1720
02:27:12,859 --> 02:27:26,363
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, there's one from Carol Gordonstein at 6 Cook Circle, who's opposed to being placed on this particular utility pole because it is close to her driveway and has lots of electrical wiring that could come down in a storm.

1721
02:27:26,383 --> 02:27:37,227
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think any more than any other pole necessarily.

1722
02:27:41,534 --> 02:27:52,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I would actually say that this is a lower amount of wiring, usually, than you see in the poll.

1723
02:27:54,257 --> 02:27:55,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, the comment is heard, for sure.

1724
02:27:55,978 --> 02:28:05,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Move approval with our standard conditions, plus the emphasis of needing to put the expansion joint on this one.

1725
02:28:06,521 --> 02:28:07,021
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, OK.

1726
02:28:10,582 --> 02:28:10,902
[SPEAKER_09]: Second.

1727
02:28:12,805 --> 02:28:14,566
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so that's a second from Marianne.

1728
02:28:15,247 --> 02:28:21,411
[SPEAKER_02]: And just to clarify, Alicia, that condition was to install an expansion joint, is that correct?

1729
02:28:21,431 --> 02:28:31,678
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, do I hear a... I should have asked Verizon if they're okay with that, but they have to be, it's a standard thing.

1730
02:28:31,958 --> 02:28:38,462
[SPEAKER_02]: So the poles need expansion joints to protect our sidewalk, so should be there anyway.

1731
02:28:38,663 --> 02:28:41,204
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so we'll take it to a vote.

1732
02:28:41,344 --> 02:28:42,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Roll call, Alicia.

1733
02:28:42,808 --> 02:28:43,008
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1734
02:28:44,228 --> 02:28:44,489
[SPEAKER_23]: Paul?

1735
02:28:45,309 --> 02:28:45,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1736
02:28:48,570 --> 02:28:48,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Mary Ann?

1737
02:28:49,670 --> 02:28:49,910
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1738
02:28:51,331 --> 02:28:51,831
[SPEAKER_02]: And me?

1739
02:28:53,291 --> 02:28:53,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1740
02:28:53,792 --> 02:29:03,455
[SPEAKER_02]: So 199 Forest Street, application 67 is approved with standard conditions plus one special condition to install an expansion joint at the base.

1741
02:29:05,873 --> 02:29:08,554
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, next application is 12 Fulton Street.

1742
02:29:09,534 --> 02:29:12,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Application number 68, utility pole number 156.

1743
02:29:13,156 --> 02:29:17,237
[SPEAKER_02]: The top of the pole is at 34 feet above grade.

1744
02:29:18,078 --> 02:29:20,539
[SPEAKER_02]: No city assets on this one, no signs, no lights.

1745
02:29:21,299 --> 02:29:22,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Appears to meet ADA offsets.

1746
02:29:25,181 --> 02:29:30,102
[SPEAKER_02]: The base of the pole, let me read my own writing.

1747
02:29:30,723 --> 02:29:33,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Base of the pole needs concrete cut out with expansion joint.

1748
02:29:34,668 --> 02:29:37,109
[SPEAKER_02]: If existing adjacent panels are cracked, they should be replaced.

1749
02:29:37,369 --> 02:29:37,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1750
02:29:37,669 --> 02:29:39,150
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to look at this one.

1751
02:29:40,130 --> 02:29:40,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

1752
02:29:41,530 --> 02:29:44,712
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what you're looking at.

1753
02:29:44,732 --> 02:29:46,332
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, this image is split.

1754
02:29:46,672 --> 02:29:47,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

1755
02:29:47,112 --> 02:29:49,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.

1756
02:29:49,813 --> 02:29:50,033
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

1757
02:29:50,374 --> 02:29:50,594
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

1758
02:29:50,614 --> 02:29:51,974
[SPEAKER_22]: So this, yeah.

1759
02:29:52,234 --> 02:29:57,136
[SPEAKER_02]: So this one, it's got just a messy bottom.

1760
02:29:59,837 --> 02:30:02,778
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to read our condition.

1761
02:30:08,101 --> 02:30:09,882
[SPEAKER_06]: And is that enough space?

1762
02:30:09,902 --> 02:30:11,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it clear?

1763
02:30:12,944 --> 02:30:13,184
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1764
02:30:17,407 --> 02:30:23,210
[SPEAKER_02]: So our condition says that the ground surface at the base of the pole must be in or restored to good condition.

1765
02:30:23,250 --> 02:30:26,552
[SPEAKER_02]: This includes repairing concrete sidewalk to city standards.

1766
02:30:26,572 --> 02:30:33,416
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would say for this one, that would include the whole panel because the panel is cracked and they would need to

1767
02:30:34,538 --> 02:30:35,998
[SPEAKER_02]: cut out for an expansion joint anyway.

1768
02:30:36,018 --> 02:30:39,679
[SPEAKER_02]: So that panel would need to be replaced.

1769
02:30:39,699 --> 02:30:45,581
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think from a condition standpoint, we can just specifically say that the panel needs to be replaced that it's in.

1770
02:30:47,281 --> 02:30:49,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless Verizon has any objections.

1771
02:30:52,903 --> 02:30:54,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Any public wanna speak for this one?

1772
02:30:55,184 --> 02:30:55,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1773
02:30:57,584 --> 02:31:00,625
[SPEAKER_02]: This one is closer to that structure than some of the other ones.

1774
02:31:00,645 --> 02:31:02,686
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 15 feet basically from that structure.

1775
02:31:04,511 --> 02:31:09,834
[SPEAKER_02]: count the entryway there from the home, 15 feet for what it's worth.

1776
02:31:11,314 --> 02:31:15,576
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyone from the public on this one, Anna?

1777
02:31:16,717 --> 02:31:18,118
[SPEAKER_08]: There are no public comments on this one.

1778
02:31:18,138 --> 02:31:23,360
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so with that said, any further discussion from the committee or?

1779
02:31:23,480 --> 02:31:25,721
[SPEAKER_10]: It's above the height of the residence.

1780
02:31:26,042 --> 02:31:32,765
[SPEAKER_10]: And okay, this is gonna be a really silly thing, but the metal pole that doesn't,

1781
02:31:34,818 --> 02:31:35,480
[SPEAKER_02]: That the riser?

1782
02:31:35,500 --> 02:31:36,503
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1783
02:31:38,187 --> 02:31:42,198
[SPEAKER_10]: That doesn't qualify it as like a double pull or anything, right?

1784
02:31:42,278 --> 02:31:42,378
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

1785
02:31:44,164 --> 02:31:48,605
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that brings things up and down from the pole.

1786
02:31:48,645 --> 02:31:59,387
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you see risers like that, it's either bringing a service down to a home or a business, or it's transitioning from underground mains to overhead mains.

1787
02:31:59,907 --> 02:32:02,227
[SPEAKER_02]: So this one probably is a service or something.

1788
02:32:02,247 --> 02:32:03,208
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll actually know that.

1789
02:32:03,508 --> 02:32:08,069
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not exactly sure what it is, but they're pretty standard features on poles.

1790
02:32:09,309 --> 02:32:09,589
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1791
02:32:10,149 --> 02:32:10,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1792
02:32:12,265 --> 02:32:15,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it looks like speed up a little bit.

1793
02:32:16,226 --> 02:32:16,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1794
02:32:16,446 --> 02:32:22,869
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we could have a, that could be a condition to clean up the riser as well.

1795
02:32:23,449 --> 02:32:27,030
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the image here is so bad.

1796
02:32:27,090 --> 02:32:32,592
[SPEAKER_06]: I was trying to get one that didn't involve the double it making it look like the plate Paul was split.

1797
02:32:33,252 --> 02:32:33,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1798
02:32:34,833 --> 02:32:35,753
[SPEAKER_02]: You go to the other side of it.

1799
02:32:39,033 --> 02:32:44,495
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the side you want to see with the riser that makes it look like it's a ghost.

1800
02:32:45,255 --> 02:32:47,955
[SPEAKER_02]: What if you go one step that way?

1801
02:32:49,796 --> 02:32:53,016
[SPEAKER_10]: So the base needs to be addressed then, right?

1802
02:32:53,196 --> 02:32:54,157
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly, too, right?

1803
02:32:54,657 --> 02:32:55,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.

1804
02:32:55,557 --> 02:33:00,798
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm suggesting, that the base be restored, including the panel that it's in.

1805
02:33:02,796 --> 02:33:05,538
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a good example of risers that we'd want to clean up.

1806
02:33:05,578 --> 02:33:06,678
[SPEAKER_02]: This one is kind of borderline.

1807
02:33:06,738 --> 02:33:08,059
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like a functional riser.

1808
02:33:08,079 --> 02:33:15,424
[SPEAKER_16]: I could share a picture if you want that's not split.

1809
02:33:16,685 --> 02:33:19,347
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, yeah, if you want to share a picture, that'd be great.

1810
02:33:19,367 --> 02:33:21,008
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, stop share for a sec.

1811
02:33:21,108 --> 02:33:21,749
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

1812
02:33:23,170 --> 02:33:23,550
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's see.

1813
02:33:36,422 --> 02:33:37,783
[SPEAKER_16]: Can you guys see the picture?

1814
02:33:38,504 --> 02:33:39,165
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1815
02:33:39,625 --> 02:33:40,546
[SPEAKER_15]: Much better, thank you.

1816
02:33:41,126 --> 02:33:45,270
[SPEAKER_22]: Any idea what that the black capped thing is next to the riser?

1817
02:33:47,352 --> 02:33:48,773
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm not sure to be honest with you.

1818
02:33:48,793 --> 02:33:49,894
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, me neither.

1819
02:33:51,616 --> 02:33:58,022
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I think for communications, but we can look into what the capped

1820
02:33:59,721 --> 02:34:12,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was gonna say, I'll suggest not only the panel replacement, but for this one to determine if that's something abandoned and if it is, it should be removed.

1821
02:34:16,470 --> 02:34:20,512
[SPEAKER_02]: So unless there are any objections, I think that's pretty simple.

1822
02:34:22,193 --> 02:34:28,856
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's a use for it, I'd like to know what it is, but more importantly, if it's abandoned, it should be removed off the ball.

1823
02:34:32,290 --> 02:34:33,171
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know what to call it.

1824
02:34:33,651 --> 02:34:35,293
[SPEAKER_02]: That black thing that's next to the riser.

1825
02:34:36,715 --> 02:34:37,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever it is messy.

1826
02:34:38,496 --> 02:34:39,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1827
02:34:39,998 --> 02:34:41,219
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so we get.

1828
02:34:41,740 --> 02:34:44,623
[SPEAKER_02]: So my suggestion for motion.

1829
02:34:45,123 --> 02:34:47,986
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, special condition would be.

1830
02:34:49,559 --> 02:34:52,101
[SPEAKER_02]: A clarification that the panel sidewalk panel should be replaced.

1831
02:34:52,482 --> 02:34:57,606
[SPEAKER_02]: This is basically a clarification on one of our conditions that exists for surface restoration.

1832
02:34:58,027 --> 02:35:04,132
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if the black capped riser, if it's abandoned or not in use, it should be removed.

1833
02:35:04,152 --> 02:35:09,637
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so do we have any public comments on this one?

1834
02:35:15,582 --> 02:35:16,163
[SPEAKER_08]: No, we do not.

1835
02:35:17,032 --> 02:35:20,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so with that said, the floor is open for motion.

1836
02:35:23,818 --> 02:35:38,230
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll make a motion to approve this with the standard conditions plus also that the panel, sidewalk panel be replaced and the black cap rises to be investigated and if it is not active or in use that be removed.

1837
02:35:38,250 --> 02:35:39,211
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1838
02:35:39,771 --> 02:35:41,693
[SPEAKER_15]: How about everything with that, Tim?

1839
02:35:42,338 --> 02:35:43,499
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1840
02:35:43,639 --> 02:35:51,065
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Chairman, could we ask for a clarification that we'll remove it if we're allowed to do so, if it's ours or something we have permission to remove?

1841
02:35:51,726 --> 02:35:54,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's a good point.

1842
02:35:54,368 --> 02:36:00,413
[SPEAKER_02]: And if allowed to move.

1843
02:36:00,913 --> 02:36:01,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1844
02:36:01,514 --> 02:36:03,075
[SPEAKER_02]: You wouldn't be able to do it if you're not allowed.

1845
02:36:06,725 --> 02:36:06,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1846
02:36:07,566 --> 02:36:10,168
[SPEAKER_02]: And when it's investigated, I'm sure you'll find out who owns it.

1847
02:36:10,248 --> 02:36:11,969
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll at least have that information.

1848
02:36:12,650 --> 02:36:13,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1849
02:36:14,511 --> 02:36:14,712
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1850
02:36:14,732 --> 02:36:15,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I have a second on that?

1851
02:36:17,134 --> 02:36:17,634
[SPEAKER_10]: A second.

1852
02:36:18,295 --> 02:36:19,395
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, there you go, Alicia.

1853
02:36:22,378 --> 02:36:22,658
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay.

1854
02:36:22,838 --> 02:36:23,979
[SPEAKER_23]: And roll call vote.

1855
02:36:24,099 --> 02:36:24,500
[SPEAKER_23]: Alicia?

1856
02:36:24,520 --> 02:36:25,320
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1857
02:36:27,702 --> 02:36:28,022
[SPEAKER_23]: Paul?

1858
02:36:28,763 --> 02:36:29,003
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes.

1859
02:36:30,865 --> 02:36:31,325
[SPEAKER_23]: Mary Ann?

1860
02:36:31,786 --> 02:36:32,066
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1861
02:36:33,487 --> 02:36:33,767
[SPEAKER_23]: Me.

1862
02:36:34,067 --> 02:36:34,328
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes.

1863
02:36:35,666 --> 02:36:43,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, 12 Fulton Street, application number 68 is approved with standard conditions, plus two specific conditions.

1864
02:36:43,529 --> 02:36:49,932
[SPEAKER_02]: One, to clarify that the surface restoration will include a new panel because the existing one is cracked.

1865
02:36:50,612 --> 02:36:59,396
[SPEAKER_02]: And if the black capped riser should be investigated and if horizon is allowed and it is inactive or abandoned, it should be removed.

1866
02:37:02,677 --> 02:37:03,578
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, next one is,

1867
02:37:05,192 --> 02:37:07,593
[SPEAKER_02]: 123 Grant Avenue, application number 71.

1868
02:37:07,633 --> 02:37:11,415
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a utility pole 1487.

1869
02:37:11,995 --> 02:37:15,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Top of the pole is at 37.8 feet above grade.

1870
02:37:16,777 --> 02:37:20,839
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to suggest that the slow children sign that's on it be replaced.

1871
02:37:21,639 --> 02:37:29,363
[SPEAKER_02]: The city has one light on it, appears to meet ADA offsets and it's about 30 feet to the closest home.

1872
02:37:31,112 --> 02:37:36,877
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, maybe, I mean, I'm just not seeing a sign, a poll with slow children on it.

1873
02:37:38,418 --> 02:37:39,599
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I think that's one of them.

1874
02:37:41,300 --> 02:37:50,968
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not, so in the application package, the sign is there, but on Google Street View, it is not.

1875
02:37:51,548 --> 02:37:53,490
[SPEAKER_02]: It is on the next poll down.

1876
02:37:54,791 --> 02:37:57,213
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know what happened.

1877
02:37:58,694 --> 02:37:59,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, interesting.

1878
02:38:00,533 --> 02:38:00,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1879
02:38:00,633 --> 02:38:12,000
[SPEAKER_06]: And do we have updated, like, MuttTV or whatever it is, have something that's better than slow children, like careful children or children at play?

1880
02:38:12,020 --> 02:38:16,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I don't know.

1881
02:38:16,023 --> 02:38:19,165
[SPEAKER_06]: I've always disliked slow children.

1882
02:38:19,185 --> 02:38:19,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1883
02:38:20,146 --> 02:38:26,790
[SPEAKER_02]: You can, you know what I say to my son sometimes, son sometimes is you should raise the kids in this neighborhood because you'll win because it's slow.

1884
02:38:27,675 --> 02:38:44,959
[SPEAKER_06]: but you know that's a good this actually shows it says caution children oh caution children i'm much more comfortable with caution it's a little thing but i agree to replace it it is funny wording so slow children careful

1885
02:38:49,936 --> 02:38:52,518
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree, but it's not on the, it is in the application.

1886
02:38:52,538 --> 02:38:53,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the right poll?

1887
02:38:53,800 --> 02:38:55,281
[SPEAKER_02]: I do want to go by the application.

1888
02:38:55,301 --> 02:38:56,682
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it is the right poll.

1889
02:38:56,702 --> 02:39:00,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but something happened in between or I don't know.

1890
02:39:01,346 --> 02:39:03,648
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to know what happened, but the application shows the sign.

1891
02:39:04,509 --> 02:39:06,150
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to go with what the application shows.

1892
02:39:06,571 --> 02:39:11,655
[SPEAKER_06]: And this poll number, we can see the poll 1487 here on the poll.

1893
02:39:12,116 --> 02:39:13,577
[SPEAKER_06]: So we know that that's the one.

1894
02:39:13,597 --> 02:39:16,940
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, so I'm just going to pull the application.

1895
02:39:19,073 --> 02:39:24,656
[SPEAKER_09]: And the height on this one again, I'm sorry.

1896
02:39:24,696 --> 02:39:24,916
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

1897
02:39:24,976 --> 02:39:28,218
[SPEAKER_23]: The height is, uh, 37.8.

1898
02:39:28,518 --> 02:39:29,059
[SPEAKER_23]: Yep.

1899
02:39:39,265 --> 02:39:45,348
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, I mean, it's also the right pole, um, here in the application package and it has the caution children sign on it.

1900
02:39:46,266 --> 02:39:46,646
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

1901
02:39:47,887 --> 02:39:49,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody moved the sign.

1902
02:39:50,089 --> 02:39:53,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it may have just been moved to a different poll.

1903
02:39:54,312 --> 02:39:55,533
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

1904
02:39:55,633 --> 02:40:06,001
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, I don't know if there's supposed to be two out there or what, but I do want to go by what the application shows if it was moved.

1905
02:40:06,902 --> 02:40:10,905
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's my two cents on it.

1906
02:40:11,605 --> 02:40:13,907
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're asking for a new caution children sign.

1907
02:40:13,927 --> 02:40:14,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1908
02:40:18,392 --> 02:40:24,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Chairman, can we say if it's supposed to be on the poll, we'll replace it?

1909
02:40:25,596 --> 02:40:26,416
[SPEAKER_02]: We can do that.

1910
02:40:26,496 --> 02:40:29,718
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I'm not sure how I've been thinking about that.

1911
02:40:29,738 --> 02:40:31,919
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, I'm not sure how to do that.

1912
02:40:33,760 --> 02:40:43,545
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can investigate through either the police or the traffic division.

1913
02:40:44,637 --> 02:40:46,458
[SPEAKER_02]: to see if they have knowledge of the sign.

1914
02:40:46,518 --> 02:40:50,301
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have a per sign inventory in the city, so we can't look it up.

1915
02:40:51,822 --> 02:40:53,804
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but yeah, I would agree.

1916
02:40:54,044 --> 02:40:58,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, if it's supposed to be there, we can use that language.

1917
02:41:00,149 --> 02:41:07,214
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking, you know, I am looking at these diagrams and it actually looks like the equipment is located where the sign was.

1918
02:41:08,035 --> 02:41:11,177
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wonder if the sign was moved in connection with that.

1919
02:41:11,217 --> 02:41:12,358
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, maybe Sean knows.

1920
02:41:14,691 --> 02:41:18,873
[SPEAKER_03]: In other words, the proposed equipment appears to be on the side where the sign is now.

1921
02:41:19,393 --> 02:41:23,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, maybe it was pulled off of there in anticipation or something.

1922
02:41:23,976 --> 02:41:24,276
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1923
02:41:24,296 --> 02:41:24,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, hopefully not.

1924
02:41:25,436 --> 02:41:31,079
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like that's why it would be nice to put one on this pole, because obviously the people in this neighborhood had one there.

1925
02:41:31,099 --> 02:41:38,102
[SPEAKER_06]: And usually people would not ask to have a cautioned children's sign.

1926
02:41:38,162 --> 02:41:43,205
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, I'm looking at the, they've put their own little cautioned children's sign out in the road.

1927
02:41:44,827 --> 02:41:45,027
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

1928
02:41:47,330 --> 02:41:53,956
[SPEAKER_05]: Tim, do you want to say that they'll replace it if feasible, and if required by the city's traffic.

1929
02:41:55,318 --> 02:42:00,904
[SPEAKER_05]: Not sure the right I think we did this last time on a couple of signs we defer to the was it the traffic coordinator or.

1930
02:42:01,760 --> 02:42:04,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Traffic director of traffic and transportation.

1931
02:42:04,142 --> 02:42:04,722
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can do that.

1932
02:42:04,742 --> 02:42:07,404
[SPEAKER_02]: We could just defer to him on that.

1933
02:42:07,465 --> 02:42:12,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause there is another, I don't know if they relocated that or there is another one on the next poll.

1934
02:42:12,849 --> 02:42:18,393
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but if it's supposed to be there and the residents wanted it there and the city put it there, then it should go back there.

1935
02:42:18,753 --> 02:42:18,953
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

1936
02:42:19,634 --> 02:42:23,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want to say feasible and required by the traffic?

1937
02:42:25,378 --> 02:42:26,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I like that.

1938
02:42:26,099 --> 02:42:27,500
[SPEAKER_02]: If feasible and.

1939
02:42:27,520 --> 02:42:31,203
[SPEAKER_02]: About deemed appropriate.

1940
02:42:36,912 --> 02:42:37,432
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, all right.

1941
02:42:37,872 --> 02:42:52,357
[SPEAKER_02]: If appropriate, and per direction of the director of traffic and transportation.

1942
02:42:54,197 --> 02:42:59,559
[SPEAKER_02]: There might be an email file somewhere that says, that has a resident requesting it, that happened somewhat recently.

1943
02:43:00,039 --> 02:43:00,379
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1944
02:43:00,459 --> 02:43:02,860
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's have that loop closed before,

1945
02:43:05,642 --> 02:43:07,143
[SPEAKER_02]: before Verizon does anything.

1946
02:43:07,163 --> 02:43:07,964
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that makes sense.

1947
02:43:08,084 --> 02:43:12,868
[SPEAKER_02]: If appropriate and per the direction of the director of traffic and transportation.

1948
02:43:14,109 --> 02:43:17,833
[SPEAKER_03]: How does that sound?

1949
02:43:17,873 --> 02:43:18,934
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's fine with Verizon.

1950
02:43:18,954 --> 02:43:23,959
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, I wanted to point out this Google street view is from November, 2020.

1951
02:43:24,159 --> 02:43:29,744
[SPEAKER_03]: It's quite possible that those pictures on the application predate November, 2020.

1952
02:43:31,230 --> 02:43:32,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotcha, gotcha.

1953
02:43:32,331 --> 02:43:38,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well, I think regardless, I think we've worded this to see if we can suss it out, figure out what's supposed to be there and get it there if we need it, so.

1954
02:43:39,079 --> 02:43:39,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1955
02:43:39,259 --> 02:43:46,046
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, with that said, there's no more discussion, public comment?

1956
02:43:46,667 --> 02:43:47,808
[SPEAKER_08]: There is no public comment.

1957
02:43:48,909 --> 02:43:53,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so with that said, any more discussion from the committee or open to a motion?

1958
02:43:57,797 --> 02:44:09,123
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you would like to include that condition in the motion, it's if the caution children sign is appropriate at this location and per the direction of the director of traffic and transportation.

1959
02:44:10,664 --> 02:44:11,605
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1960
02:44:14,806 --> 02:44:15,747
[SPEAKER_23]: Alicia, so moved.

1961
02:44:15,887 --> 02:44:16,207
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay.

1962
02:44:16,227 --> 02:44:17,428
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll hear a second.

1963
02:44:19,049 --> 02:44:23,071
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's that motion included the standard conditions as well?

1964
02:44:23,631 --> 02:44:23,831
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1965
02:44:24,492 --> 02:44:24,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1966
02:44:24,892 --> 02:44:25,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1967
02:44:25,252 --> 02:44:25,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Just clarifying.

1968
02:44:26,453 --> 02:44:26,993
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll hear a second.

1969
02:44:29,140 --> 02:44:29,480
[SPEAKER_09]: Second.

1970
02:44:30,801 --> 02:44:34,123
[SPEAKER_23]: Marianne seconds that motion and roll call vote.

1971
02:44:34,523 --> 02:44:34,883
[SPEAKER_23]: Alicia?

1972
02:44:34,903 --> 02:44:36,704
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1973
02:44:38,004 --> 02:44:38,285
[SPEAKER_23]: Paul?

1974
02:44:39,105 --> 02:44:39,385
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes.

1975
02:44:40,726 --> 02:44:41,206
[SPEAKER_23]: Marianne?

1976
02:44:42,086 --> 02:44:42,327
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1977
02:44:44,187 --> 02:44:44,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Tim, yes.

1978
02:44:45,980 --> 02:45:02,626
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so 123 Grand Avenue, application 71 is approved with conditions, standard conditions, plus one special condition that the caution children's sign be replaced if it's appropriate per the direction of the director of traffic and transportation for the city.

1979
02:45:04,167 --> 02:45:06,588
[SPEAKER_02]: Next one is Logan Avenue, no address.

1980
02:45:07,999 --> 02:45:10,903
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's application number 73, utility pole 4307.

1981
02:45:11,784 --> 02:45:17,931
[SPEAKER_02]: The top of the pole above grade is 33.5 feet.

1982
02:45:19,013 --> 02:45:21,335
[SPEAKER_02]: No signs, but there's a city light to remain.

1983
02:45:21,355 --> 02:45:26,662
[SPEAKER_02]: It appears to meet ADA offsets and it is next to a park and a playground.

1984
02:45:31,561 --> 02:45:32,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Logan Park right there.

1985
02:45:33,102 --> 02:45:34,404
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's actually the park.

1986
02:45:35,044 --> 02:45:37,086
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a tree there, kind of in the middle of the park.

1987
02:45:37,166 --> 02:45:39,668
[SPEAKER_02]: It's obscured by the tree there, so.

1988
02:45:41,510 --> 02:45:41,950
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait.

1989
02:45:43,552 --> 02:45:45,773
[SPEAKER_06]: It appears to be obscured by a fingerprint.

1990
02:45:45,954 --> 02:45:47,115
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not that one.

1991
02:45:47,455 --> 02:45:47,695
[SPEAKER_22]: There.

1992
02:45:48,035 --> 02:45:48,836
[SPEAKER_22]: I believe it's this one here.

1993
02:45:48,856 --> 02:45:49,016
[SPEAKER_22]: This one?

1994
02:45:49,817 --> 02:45:50,498
[SPEAKER_22]: I believe it's that one.

1995
02:45:50,938 --> 02:45:51,438
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, OK.

1996
02:45:53,480 --> 02:45:53,660
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah.

1997
02:45:54,801 --> 02:45:55,422
[SPEAKER_23]: Let's double check.

1998
02:46:00,512 --> 02:46:02,513
[SPEAKER_07]: I kicked my paperwork too, sorry.

1999
02:46:05,655 --> 02:46:06,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's the one.

2000
02:46:08,836 --> 02:46:10,057
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the poll right there.

2001
02:46:11,837 --> 02:46:13,798
[SPEAKER_02]: So any discussion?

2002
02:46:20,762 --> 02:46:22,603
[SPEAKER_07]: It's tall, it's far from houses.

2003
02:46:22,723 --> 02:46:29,426
[SPEAKER_06]: It's in a green space, so it's not blocking anything.

2004
02:46:32,633 --> 02:46:33,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Any public comment, Anna?

2005
02:46:35,115 --> 02:46:36,636
[SPEAKER_08]: There are no public comments on this one.

2006
02:46:37,757 --> 02:46:38,117
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

2007
02:46:39,558 --> 02:46:42,561
[SPEAKER_22]: So the floor is open for any more discussion or a motion.

2008
02:46:44,462 --> 02:46:47,204
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll make a motion to approve with standard conditions.

2009
02:46:47,224 --> 02:46:50,667
[SPEAKER_15]: Do we have a second?

2010
02:46:55,170 --> 02:46:55,830
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll second.

2011
02:46:58,933 --> 02:46:59,213
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry.

2012
02:46:59,852 --> 02:47:01,133
[SPEAKER_23]: Roll call vote, Alicia?

2013
02:47:01,794 --> 02:47:02,034
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

2014
02:47:04,616 --> 02:47:04,997
[SPEAKER_23]: Paul?

2015
02:47:05,817 --> 02:47:06,078
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes.

2016
02:47:07,139 --> 02:47:07,759
[SPEAKER_23]: Mary Ann?

2017
02:47:08,300 --> 02:47:08,580
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2018
02:47:10,081 --> 02:47:11,082
[SPEAKER_23]: And me, Tim?

2019
02:47:11,703 --> 02:47:12,043
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes.

2020
02:47:13,664 --> 02:47:19,229
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Logan Avenue, number 73, application number 73 is approved with standard conditions.

2021
02:47:19,810 --> 02:47:22,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Next one is 83 Washington Street, application number 75.

2022
02:47:25,752 --> 02:47:26,793
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one more after this one.

2023
02:47:27,993 --> 02:47:32,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's check the time, nine o'clock, we're almost nine, so we're in good shape.

2024
02:47:33,356 --> 02:47:36,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, this is utility pole 3697, it's actually on Park Street.

2025
02:47:36,678 --> 02:47:38,279
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the top of the pole is 33.8 feet above ground level.

2026
02:47:48,590 --> 02:47:50,631
[SPEAKER_02]: No signs, no city assets.

2027
02:47:51,391 --> 02:47:54,693
[SPEAKER_02]: It appears to meet ADA offsets, clearances.

2028
02:47:54,713 --> 02:47:56,794
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the one I did a while ago.

2029
02:47:57,595 --> 02:47:59,436
[SPEAKER_02]: And closest building is about 43 feet.

2030
02:48:00,976 --> 02:48:01,877
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's not it.

2031
02:48:03,818 --> 02:48:06,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't know if you caught it, Alicia, but it's actually on Park Street.

2032
02:48:06,699 --> 02:48:07,280
[SPEAKER_02]: It's around the corner.

2033
02:48:09,581 --> 02:48:10,881
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is Park Street.

2034
02:48:12,142 --> 02:48:12,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, OK.

2035
02:48:13,903 --> 02:48:15,724
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not that one.

2036
02:48:16,304 --> 02:48:17,625
[SPEAKER_07]: So how far down is it?

2037
02:48:18,448 --> 02:48:19,089
[SPEAKER_16]: Turn around.

2038
02:48:19,109 --> 02:48:21,090
[SPEAKER_13]: Turn around.

2039
02:48:21,190 --> 02:48:21,470
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

2040
02:48:21,510 --> 02:48:21,811
[SPEAKER_16]: Here?

2041
02:48:22,611 --> 02:48:26,394
[SPEAKER_16]: Yep, it's that first one right there.

2042
02:48:26,574 --> 02:48:26,734
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh.

2043
02:48:30,017 --> 02:48:31,738
[SPEAKER_07]: That's Washington Street.

2044
02:48:35,561 --> 02:48:36,541
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

2045
02:48:36,561 --> 02:48:36,722
[SPEAKER_13]: It's.

2046
02:48:38,223 --> 02:48:39,724
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the red house.

2047
02:48:42,896 --> 02:48:44,177
[SPEAKER_16]: You don't have the pole in the picture.

2048
02:48:44,197 --> 02:48:46,399
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, let's see if it's right, right here across.

2049
02:48:46,419 --> 02:48:46,999
[SPEAKER_16]: There you go.

2050
02:48:47,040 --> 02:48:48,281
[SPEAKER_16]: That pole right in front of it.

2051
02:48:48,881 --> 02:48:51,223
[SPEAKER_16]: It's in front of the fence near the pseudo bridge.

2052
02:48:52,064 --> 02:48:52,584
[SPEAKER_13]: This one?

2053
02:48:55,246 --> 02:48:57,308
[SPEAKER_22]: There's a PVC fence on Park Street.

2054
02:48:59,510 --> 02:48:59,770
[SPEAKER_02]: There.

2055
02:49:00,991 --> 02:49:01,712
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's this one?

2056
02:49:01,732 --> 02:49:02,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there you go.

2057
02:49:03,073 --> 02:49:03,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, OK.

2058
02:49:03,813 --> 02:49:05,655
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's really that far down Park Street.

2059
02:49:09,338 --> 02:49:09,738
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah.

2060
02:49:09,818 --> 02:49:11,940
[SPEAKER_15]: So that is the pole right

2061
02:49:12,273 --> 02:49:12,854
[SPEAKER_15]: There, yep.

2062
02:49:12,874 --> 02:49:20,181
[SPEAKER_15]: And that looks a little tight, but you're okay with the ADA clearance on that?

2063
02:49:20,301 --> 02:49:21,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's right up against that.

2064
02:49:22,303 --> 02:49:27,268
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't field check this one because it's right up against the back of the guardrail.

2065
02:49:27,669 --> 02:49:30,171
[SPEAKER_02]: And between the guardrail and the pass looks about five feet or so.

2066
02:49:30,191 --> 02:49:33,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that should be okay.

2067
02:49:34,602 --> 02:49:36,922
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks tight, but okay.

2068
02:49:37,042 --> 02:49:37,843
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, they look tight.

2069
02:49:37,883 --> 02:49:39,023
[SPEAKER_22]: It's deceiving.

2070
02:49:39,643 --> 02:49:48,384
[SPEAKER_22]: But if you look at thousands of them, you start to, I walked down the street and I know for over 2% and we don't have that three foot clearance.

2071
02:49:51,965 --> 02:49:53,245
[SPEAKER_02]: So this one is good.

2072
02:49:53,265 --> 02:50:01,227
[SPEAKER_02]: And I should clarify too, when I do this, it's, you know, I say the word appear because, you know,

2073
02:50:03,418 --> 02:50:08,920
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's the proponent's job to confirm and make sure that all those 88 clearances are there.

2074
02:50:09,420 --> 02:50:14,102
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'm looking at, does it appear to meet those clearances, is really what I'm looking at.

2075
02:50:14,443 --> 02:50:17,164
[SPEAKER_02]: And I field check if I have a question.

2076
02:50:18,004 --> 02:50:30,689
[SPEAKER_06]: I think actually we're not showing their application on the screen, but the image in there is taken from a better angle that when you look at that angle with the person in there, it's clearly enough space.

2077
02:50:32,110 --> 02:50:32,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2078
02:50:34,094 --> 02:50:35,655
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so public comment on this one.

2079
02:50:35,675 --> 02:50:41,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually, I mean, there's more discussion, but Anna, if you want to check with this public comment, we can continue the discussion if needed.

2080
02:50:42,802 --> 02:50:44,763
[SPEAKER_08]: There is no public comment at this time.

2081
02:50:44,783 --> 02:50:48,767
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so with that said, we can continue discussion and the floor is open for a motion.

2082
02:50:51,589 --> 02:50:53,170
[SPEAKER_15]: That looks like it's got plenty of clearance.

2083
02:50:53,210 --> 02:51:00,597
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll make a motion to, unless there's any other concerns by the committee, I'll make a motion to approve this with the standing conditions.

2084
02:51:01,623 --> 02:51:04,604
[SPEAKER_09]: Was the base okay, Tim and you?

2085
02:51:06,284 --> 02:51:09,625
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it would fall under the standard condition of basic restoration.

2086
02:51:10,826 --> 02:51:14,687
[SPEAKER_02]: This one's a little patch of green space, so I'll probably need to brush it up a little bit.

2087
02:51:14,967 --> 02:51:18,328
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so that's standard conditions, all right, okay.

2088
02:51:18,368 --> 02:51:21,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, it's a general restoration of the surface.

2089
02:51:22,389 --> 02:51:30,572
[SPEAKER_02]: So if it's something like this, then that might, you may hit it with a rake or something, remove any of the large pebbles and cobbles

2090
02:51:33,504 --> 02:51:33,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

2091
02:51:33,684 --> 02:51:38,028
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so we got a motion on the cable from Paul.

2092
02:51:38,068 --> 02:51:39,209
[SPEAKER_02]: Did we get a second?

2093
02:51:39,229 --> 02:51:40,750
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll second.

2094
02:51:41,351 --> 02:51:43,352
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Marianne seconds that motion.

2095
02:51:44,013 --> 02:51:45,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Roll call vote, Alicia?

2096
02:51:45,714 --> 02:51:45,974
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

2097
02:51:47,476 --> 02:51:47,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Paul?

2098
02:51:48,657 --> 02:51:48,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2099
02:51:49,798 --> 02:51:50,258
[SPEAKER_02]: Marianne?

2100
02:51:51,039 --> 02:51:51,279
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2101
02:51:52,740 --> 02:51:53,801
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm a yes as well.

2102
02:51:54,501 --> 02:52:02,068
[SPEAKER_02]: So 83 Washington Street, application number 75, approved with conditions, standard conditions.

2103
02:52:03,307 --> 02:52:06,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, last one on the agenda for tonight.

2104
02:52:06,548 --> 02:52:09,789
[SPEAKER_02]: 59 Jerome Street, application number 82.

2105
02:52:09,829 --> 02:52:10,489
[SPEAKER_02]: The poll is number 872.

2106
02:52:11,509 --> 02:52:13,809
[SPEAKER_02]: The top of the poll is 34.1 feet above grade level, ground level.

2107
02:52:13,829 --> 02:52:15,230
[SPEAKER_02]: I did this one a while ago.

2108
02:52:15,270 --> 02:52:17,630
[SPEAKER_02]: It says there's an old Slow Children's sign on it.

2109
02:52:29,435 --> 02:52:31,716
[SPEAKER_02]: that we may want to replace.

2110
02:52:32,717 --> 02:52:34,117
[SPEAKER_02]: It appears to meet ADA offsets.

2111
02:52:34,618 --> 02:52:35,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Closest building is about 20 feet.

2112
02:52:35,998 --> 02:52:43,082
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember this one.

2113
02:52:43,522 --> 02:52:47,424
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just triangulating here.

2114
02:52:47,444 --> 02:52:50,045
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll compare it to my paper notes.

2115
02:52:53,913 --> 02:53:04,261
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a non, not really a material question, but I was sort of curious why this one outlier way on the other side of Medford from all the others.

2116
02:53:04,342 --> 02:53:09,406
[SPEAKER_06]: I assume that means more will be coming over here, but it seemed odd.

2117
02:53:11,207 --> 02:53:11,668
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.

2118
02:53:11,828 --> 02:53:12,748
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a good question.

2119
02:53:14,270 --> 02:53:18,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone from Verizon want to address that, why this is an outlier in the West Medford area.

2120
02:53:18,593 --> 02:53:19,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have a reason for that?

2121
02:53:21,976 --> 02:53:23,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Sean, do you know?

2122
02:53:24,001 --> 02:53:30,244
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I mean, we've filed applications with the utility companies and they work through them based on how we file.

2123
02:53:30,285 --> 02:53:33,446
[SPEAKER_16]: This one might've just got in front of some other applications.

2124
02:53:33,526 --> 02:53:37,308
[SPEAKER_16]: So we, you know, once we got our licenses, we're ready to move and get these things built.

2125
02:53:38,349 --> 02:53:38,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotcha.

2126
02:53:38,669 --> 02:53:41,411
[SPEAKER_02]: So it could be a little bit of a foreshadowing for the next round.

2127
02:53:42,691 --> 02:53:43,312
[SPEAKER_02]: So, okay.

2128
02:53:45,153 --> 02:53:49,815
[SPEAKER_06]: So the base of that, is that what you would call an expansion joint, the way we're looking at it there?

2129
02:53:50,596 --> 02:53:50,776
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

2130
02:53:52,817 --> 02:53:58,700
[SPEAKER_06]: Can we request that the slow children's sign be replaced with a caution children's sign?

2131
02:53:58,720 --> 02:54:03,381
[SPEAKER_06]: That does look like it's from the 1970s.

2132
02:54:03,401 --> 02:54:05,502
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with that suggestion.

2133
02:54:05,923 --> 02:54:08,764
[SPEAKER_02]: So when the motion comes up, include that.

2134
02:54:09,084 --> 02:54:10,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Does Verizon have any objections to that?

2135
02:54:12,325 --> 02:54:13,686
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think so, Mr. Chairman.

2136
02:54:14,266 --> 02:54:14,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you.

2137
02:54:15,687 --> 02:54:16,847
[SPEAKER_02]: So caution children.

2138
02:54:16,887 --> 02:54:17,728
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so,

2139
02:54:20,954 --> 02:54:25,137
[SPEAKER_02]: when it comes time for a motion, I'll remind us of that.

2140
02:54:26,458 --> 02:54:30,541
[SPEAKER_02]: And do we have any public comment on this one?

2141
02:54:30,641 --> 02:54:34,044
[SPEAKER_02]: And discussion can continue, but any public?

2142
02:54:35,285 --> 02:54:35,445
[SPEAKER_02]: No?

2143
02:54:36,205 --> 02:54:37,166
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

2144
02:54:38,090 --> 02:54:56,505
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so either continue the discussion or the floor is open to a motion and I would recommend that motion include the standard conditions plus a condition that says replace the older slow children's sign with a newer caution children's sign.

2145
02:54:56,525 --> 02:55:04,011
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll make a motion to approve it.

2146
02:55:08,032 --> 02:55:17,235
[SPEAKER_06]: with the condition that they replace the slow children's sign with a modern new caution children's sign.

2147
02:55:18,936 --> 02:55:20,476
[SPEAKER_06]: And our standard conditions.

2148
02:55:20,496 --> 02:55:22,477
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2149
02:55:23,457 --> 02:55:24,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I hear a second?

2150
02:55:24,137 --> 02:55:24,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Paul, you want to second that one?

2151
02:55:25,938 --> 02:55:26,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I do.

2152
02:55:26,478 --> 02:55:26,998
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll second it.

2153
02:55:27,819 --> 02:55:28,419
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2154
02:55:29,079 --> 02:55:30,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Wonder who got the most seconds tonight.

2155
02:55:30,339 --> 02:55:33,320
[SPEAKER_02]: Tally it up.

2156
02:55:33,501 --> 02:55:35,981
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2157
02:55:36,061 --> 02:55:36,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Roll call vote.

2158
02:55:36,862 --> 02:55:37,182
[SPEAKER_02]: Alicia?

2159
02:55:40,821 --> 02:55:41,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Paul?

2160
02:55:41,902 --> 02:55:42,122
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

2161
02:55:43,202 --> 02:55:43,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Mary Ann?

2162
02:55:44,263 --> 02:55:44,503
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

2163
02:55:45,604 --> 02:55:46,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Amy, yes.

2164
02:55:47,204 --> 02:56:02,292
[SPEAKER_02]: So 59 Jerome Street, application number 82 is approved with standard conditions and one site-specific condition to replace the old existing slow children's sign with a new caution children's sign.

2165
02:56:08,219 --> 02:56:11,780
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the next item would be adjournment.

2166
02:56:12,741 --> 02:56:27,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Tim, before we adjourn, I don't know that it's necessary, but do you wanna just do entertain a motion to have the board authorize you to write up the decisions, consult with council if necessary and file them on behalf of the board?

2167
02:56:28,537 --> 02:56:29,897
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a very good idea, thank you.

2168
02:56:30,098 --> 02:56:35,879
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is definitely something I'd like to, someone else would need to make that motion.

2169
02:56:37,540 --> 02:56:52,105
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, if committee members heard that and understood it, I would definitely entertain a motion like that, basically giving me the authority as the chair to write up these decisions and issue them without further committee involvement.

2170
02:56:52,345 --> 02:56:54,086
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically as an administrative task.

2171
02:56:54,106 --> 02:56:56,226
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how we did it last time.

2172
02:56:56,926 --> 02:56:57,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2173
02:56:59,623 --> 02:57:00,423
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, do we have a second?

2174
02:57:02,364 --> 02:57:02,684
[SPEAKER_10]: Second.

2175
02:57:03,745 --> 02:57:05,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

2176
02:57:05,745 --> 02:57:06,766
[SPEAKER_02]: And take a roll call vote.

2177
02:57:06,806 --> 02:57:07,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Alicia?

2178
02:57:09,026 --> 02:57:09,227
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

2179
02:57:11,147 --> 02:57:11,447
[SPEAKER_23]: Paul?

2180
02:57:12,508 --> 02:57:12,728
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes.

2181
02:57:15,349 --> 02:57:15,769
[SPEAKER_23]: Mary Ann?

2182
02:57:16,309 --> 02:57:16,549
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

2183
02:57:21,671 --> 02:57:22,131
[SPEAKER_21]: Amy?

2184
02:57:22,391 --> 02:57:22,672
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

2185
02:57:22,692 --> 02:57:25,152
[SPEAKER_21]: So just catching up with myself, writing down votes.

2186
02:57:27,119 --> 02:57:33,742
[SPEAKER_11]: And while you're writing, Tim, could Verizon please send us a copy of the presentation that was utilized today?

2187
02:57:33,762 --> 02:57:37,764
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll make sure that happens.

2188
02:57:38,504 --> 02:57:39,204
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

2189
02:57:39,745 --> 02:57:40,225
[SPEAKER_02]: You're welcome.

2190
02:57:40,425 --> 02:57:40,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

2191
02:57:41,345 --> 02:57:44,866
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think everybody knows too that this was recorded.

2192
02:57:45,526 --> 02:57:48,327
[SPEAKER_02]: So I need to go back for reference at all.

2193
02:57:49,468 --> 02:57:52,148
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, so, okay, so that passed.

2194
02:57:52,729 --> 02:57:57,090
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll take care of the administrative task of issuing the decisions.

2195
02:57:58,690 --> 02:57:58,990
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2196
02:58:01,531 --> 02:58:04,232
[SPEAKER_02]: And the next item is adjournment.

2197
02:58:04,272 --> 02:58:07,293
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will entertain a motion for adjournment.

2198
02:58:10,394 --> 02:58:11,215
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to adjourn.

2199
02:58:11,235 --> 02:58:13,856
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, Marianne.

2200
02:58:13,876 --> 02:58:15,277
[SPEAKER_21]: Adjourn.

2201
02:58:15,297 --> 02:58:17,218
[SPEAKER_21]: Do we hear a second?

2202
02:58:19,760 --> 02:58:20,120
[SPEAKER_13]: I second.

2203
02:58:21,802 --> 02:58:22,202
[SPEAKER_13]: We vote.

2204
02:58:22,262 --> 02:58:22,862
[SPEAKER_02]: A second there.

2205
02:58:22,882 --> 02:58:23,443
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.

2206
02:58:23,463 --> 02:58:24,363
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.

2207
02:58:24,543 --> 02:58:25,244
[SPEAKER_02]: The double second.

2208
02:58:25,284 --> 02:58:27,265
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to note that down as Paul.

2209
02:58:27,325 --> 02:58:28,126
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard his voice first.

2210
02:58:30,327 --> 02:58:31,588
[SPEAKER_02]: And roll call vote.

2211
02:58:31,728 --> 02:58:32,088
[SPEAKER_23]: Alicia?

2212
02:58:32,709 --> 02:58:32,909
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

2213
02:58:34,850 --> 02:58:35,150
[SPEAKER_23]: Paul?

2214
02:58:35,931 --> 02:58:36,171
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes.

2215
02:58:37,752 --> 02:58:38,212
[SPEAKER_23]: Marianne?

2216
02:58:38,793 --> 02:58:38,993
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

2217
02:58:42,834 --> 02:58:44,576
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will say yes as well.

2218
02:58:45,236 --> 02:58:47,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much, everybody.

2219
02:58:47,418 --> 02:58:50,601
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 910.

2220
02:58:50,721 --> 02:58:54,885
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think much different than last time.

2221
02:58:54,905 --> 02:58:57,067
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank everybody for their patience.

2222
02:58:57,527 --> 02:59:00,871
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, the next phase is getting those decisions out.

2223
02:59:00,971 --> 02:59:01,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Verizon.

2224
02:59:01,691 --> 02:59:03,493
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you to members of the public who hung on
