    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=625.007s">Councilor</a>  Callahan, Vice President Collins, Councilor Lazzaro, Councilor Leming, present. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=633.21s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli, Councilor Tseng, President Bears, present, seven present, none absent.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=638.311s">The</a>  meeting is called to order. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=639.192s">Please</a>  rise to salute the flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=654.229s">Before</a>  we start, this is our last meeting of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=657.13s">And</a>  I do ask my colleagues for limited indulgence and welcome the crowd for being here as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=665.111s">I</a>  just wanna thank my colleagues for an incredible 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=668.452s">It's</a>  been a busy year of nearly a hundred meetings of this body and committee and in regular session. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=677.194s">And</a>  I don't think anyone can say that this council has not been outspoken and spoken its mind on a variety of topics. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=683.888s">In</a>  January, I spoke about three leadership principles, collaboration, planning, and trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=689.973s">This</a>  council has worked together collaboratively within our committees with the city administration, city staff, community organizations, businesses, educational institutions, and thousands of residents to implement and discuss a clear and transparent governing agenda created and published in February. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=710.117s">Tomorrow</a>  night we're going to conduct our one year review of that plan and suggest updates for the year ahead and I encourage everyone in our city to join us. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=719.16s">I</a>  firmly believe that this open and direct approach to governance is foundational to good governance and to trust, and I'm going to continue to lead with these principles in 2025. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=730.365s">There's</a>  always disagreement, and we've had some tough meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=734.761s">I'm</a>  always open to meet with anyone, whether that's Councilors, residents, employees of the city and others to hear from them. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=741.665s">And</a>  of course, this council will always hear from anyone who speaks at this podium under our rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=747.509s">I'm</a>  excited for 2025. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=750.65s">Earlier</a>  this week, released our January to June schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=753.872s">There</a>  are 60 meetings scheduled on topics including the budget, a new city charter, zoning and much more. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=762.284s">And</a>  I really just want to implore and invite the community to join us in the process of building a better Medford together. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=768.776s">So</a>  thank you for your indulgence. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=770.479s">And</a>  with that, we'll move to the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=774.44s">Announcements,</a>  accolades, remembrances, reports, and records. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=778.303s">24-512</a>  offered by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=781.946s">Be</a>  it resolved that the Medford City Council commend and congratulate Barbara Kerr for her 40 years of tireless and selfless service at the Medford Public Library. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=790.072s">We</a>  thank her for her work with our residents and for providing a welcoming hub for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=795.236s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=796.956s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=798.297s">And</a>  when you talk about, imagine doing anything for 40 years, how impressive that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=804.343s">And</a>  what Barbara has endured for 40 years at <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=810.506s">The</a>  beginning is a library, it's running a library and then a subpar library, then a failing library with ceilings caving in and then going through the process of a new library and maintaining an opportunity in pilot libraries across the city and working together with former City Council President Caraviello to bring to fruition a new library in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=838.116s">a</a>  cornerstone now, a great piece of our Medford Square entrance, and to see what Barbara has given to our community, something needs to be commended. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=850.851s">If</a>  I can, if I could, I would recommend, Council President, that <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=854.515s">We</a>  have Barbara here at one of our upcoming meetings so we can present her with a citation with appreciation for all of our hard work for the citizens and the residents of Medford and working at our Medford Public Library for 40 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=869.805s">Very</a>  impressive. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=870.526s">So</a>  thank you, Barbara, for all your hard work.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=872.868s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=874.208s">Councilor</a>  Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=875.834s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=876.534s">Um,</a>  thank you, Councilor Scarpelli for putting this on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=880.537s">Barbara</a>  is such a foundational part of what makes the public library tick. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=886.06s">And</a>  as you noted, and I think as we can all agree, our library is a gem of Medford Square and it's a gem of the Medford community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=895.103s">Tons</a>  of people come from out of the city to use it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=898.245s">Our</a>  residents, I think, very much treasure it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=901.067s">And</a>  Barbara's hard work is what makes it tick. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=904.989s">She</a>  works so hard when it comes to making sure the library has the resources she needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=909.932s">It</a>  needs making sure that there's enough programming for <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=915.769s">of</a>  wide range of Medford residents, despite their age, their background, making sure that people feel welcome in that space as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=923.418s">Her</a>  hard work on getting the new library built, as is, is also something that our city council should really recognize and be thankful for. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=935.051s">also</a>  relevant to the City Council is the work that she puts into letting us know what resources the library needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=942.493s">I</a>  know a lot of us have been at the annual sit-downs before the budget season with the library staff and the Board of Trustees where they let us know what they need. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=953.437s">And</a>  that's a testament to her organization and her energy doing that work and fighting for the public library. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=961.563s">I'm</a>  very grateful for this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=963.205s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli for introducing it.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=966.188s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=967.129s">Vice</a>  President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=969.633s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=970.534s">Thank</a>  you as well, Councilor Scarpelli for putting this on and making sure that we properly recognized Director Kerr for her 40 incredible years leading the Medford Public Library. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=981.841s">You</a>  know, a lot great has been said about Barbara. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=985.223s">We</a>  could go on all night just talking about Barbara, but what really strikes me about her from all the meetings we've had with her over the past three years is she brings <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=993.007s">Obviously,</a>  so much skill so much knowledge so much experience to run the library and she's been doing this for four decades and she's made sure that our library remains contemporary over the years and she really fought to make sure that we can now enjoy a public modern contemporary public library and. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1009.744s">You</a>  know, some people know really well just how, just how much hard work and advocacy and how many risks it took to make it the incredible, you know, really model library that it is today. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1020.032s">So</a>  we can't thank her enough, not just for the recent, you know, really, really visible accomplishments, but for all of the work that preceded that to bring us to the community space that we get to enjoy and that we'll get to enjoy for so many years to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1030.76s">So</a>  thank you, Barbara. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1031.901s">We</a>  could truly go on all night talking about her. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1034.083s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1036.397s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins, and I just want to note certainly to thank Barbara, and I think Barbara would also want us to thank her staff, the trustees, the Library Foundation, which has been so instrumental in the construction of and outfitting of the new library, the friends of the Medford Public Library, and all of the folks who walk through those doors or use the online resources or take out a book <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1063.329s">or</a>  other material at the library has really become so much more than just a place to go and get a book, but it really provides essential community services to so many people in our community, especially our kids and our teens. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1075.975s">So</a>  just thank you to Barbara and the whole library team. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1080.377s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Tseng, and we will invite Director Kerr for a citation in the new year. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1088.561s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1653.706s">I</a>  have slides that we showed last night, but what I was going to offer is that I would give you a brief summary and why now. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1662.112s">And</a>  then if the city council would like to do a committee of the whole with the materials that we had last night at the early January before the third reading, assuming that the council is willing to do the first reading tonight, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1678.484s">We'd</a>  be happy to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1680.025s">We</a>  also, the timing of this is that we're asking for $5 million now to get the project, we've been started, but to get a number of the design work done and long lead time items purchased. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1694.469s">There</a>  are some items we would like to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1696.51s">We</a>  expect to have the air conditioning working by September. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1699.571s">To</a>  do that, some of the equipment has more than 16 weekly times. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1703.973s">And</a>  so we would like to order that equipment as quickly as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1707.574s">So</a>  we're asking for the $5 million now for the early work and the funding to take the design to 100% design and to bring the construction manager at risk on. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1718.978s">And</a>  then our intention is to come back <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1721.141s">either</a>  in late March or early April and ask for additional money that would be the rest of the money for this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1726.803s">This</a>  is not a $5 million project. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1728.944s">This</a>  is more like a $25 million project. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1733.125s">And</a>  we would be happy to do a committee of the whole first week of January, second week of January, if you'd like. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1739.671s">or</a>  we can end or we could do a more complete once we have 100% construction documents in March, a committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1747.618s">I'm</a>  also prepared to share some slides this evening or go into some more of the details this evening, but I didn't wanna take an hour out of a city council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1754.665s">I</a>  wanted to give you the basics tonight and then schedule something longer in early January.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1784.605s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1785.506s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1786.146s">I'm</a>  glad that <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1791.391s">I</a>  would welcome that we go, we revert this to a committee of the whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1795.655s">I</a>  think that when you're talking something about in the process of a $25 million project, I think this is where we need to sit down before we vote on anything and just look into the finances and what <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1807.216s">where</a>  we're going in our community and where we are since the override. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1811.278s">I</a>  know that there are big questions out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1814.3s">What</a>  are we still doing with the fire department? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1816.201s">What</a>  are we doing with the new high school if that comes down the line? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1819.563s">How</a>  much money will we be able to bond? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1821.504s">So</a>  it'll be interesting to get those questions answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1823.485s">And</a>  to approve $5 million not knowing, with some clarity for the other $20 million, I think that would <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1829.997s">that</a>  would be irresponsible for us to move that forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1833.478s">So</a>  I would recommend that we move this completely to a committee of the whole meeting so we can look at the different options. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1839.081s">I</a>  know there's been some talk that there's been some money freed up from ARPA due to the override success. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1846.623s">So</a>  it'd be interesting to see if we can use other avenues to look into possible ways to fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1853.506s">So</a>  I know it's needed, not saying that I wouldn't support it, but I think that <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1858.768s">for</a>  one council, and we're talking about being stewards of our budgetary process, I think it's important that we sit down and evaluate the whole financial process. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1868.634s">It's</a>  nice that the school committee voted 7-0 because they should. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1873.117s">They</a>  want everything fixed, but they don't control the budgetary process, and I think it's important that this council really understands our whole, because I believe we talked about this too, Council President, is understanding our <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1887.785s">capital</a>  plan and understanding where we're going with that capital plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1891.028s">So</a>  I would recommend, I appreciate your thoughts and your leadership, but I would recommend we go directly to community to the whole with this process from beginning to end. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1901.416s">So</a>  thank you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1902.745s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1903.105s">Before</a>  I recognize Councilor Collins and Councilor Callahan, I do just want to note on the ARPA funding that has to be encumbered by December 31st. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1912.251s">And</a>  we did receive a communication from the mayor at a large chunk of that 800,000 plus dollars that we were able to buy a fire engine from the city of Lynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1921.796s">So</a>  there's a new fire engine coming through that money. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1925.018s">So</a>  a large chunk of that money has been appropriated. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1927.9s">It</a>  does have to be encumbered by the end of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1929.601s">I'll</a>  go to Vice President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1933.837s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1934.537s">Thank</a>  you so much for being with us tonight and thank you for being with the school committee yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1938.718s">I</a>  know it's a really busy time of year, but it's really exciting to see that this project is being pushed forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1945.9s">We've</a>  been hearing about the HVAC issues in Medford Public Schools for a really long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1951.701s">It</a>  feels like forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1953.001s">And</a>  it's exciting to be at a point where we can be talking about pre-implementation and implementation of the projects that will <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1960.923s">allow</a>  the schools to remain the comfortable temperatures that students can learn and thrive in. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1967.346s">Before</a>  any motions are made, I'd be eager to hear that kind of like brief synopsis about the bird's eye view, why now to kind of get our heads around the urgency around this. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1977.711s">To</a>  me, we've been hearing from parents and educators for such a long time about the really severe heating and cooling issues in the Medford public schools that I feel pretty comfortable taking a vote on this ASAP. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1987.715s">but</a>  I'd like to hear your presentation first. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1989.436s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1989.956s">Or</a>  the short form your presentation first, to be clear, not the hour long version. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1993.318s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1996.199s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1996.459s">I'll</a>  go to Councilor Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1999.701s">Steal</a>  my thunder. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2000.621s">I</a>  basically was going to see if you had, like, how short is your short version of your presentation? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2004.823s">And</a>  if there's something you can give that's five minutes or less that can really give us an overview. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2009.965s">And</a>  as well, if you can also give us a little bit of an understanding of <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2016.669s">exactly</a>  how important the timing is and whether getting something, you know, obviously this is a process, it would not be approved tonight, it has three readings, whether us bringing it forward tonight is crucial to the timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2030.463s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2038.52s">Council</a>  President, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2039.96s">We</a>  have with us tonight our owners project manager, Tom Ellis, and I believe that it would make sense for him to actually address the questions of the timing and the urgency that it feels like he's prepared to speak to why and how that timing would work. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2057.045s">And</a>  I think that's better than trying to go through all the materials about the whole thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2062.766s">So</a>  why don't I introduce Tom and I'll let him explain.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2066.121s">Thank</a>  you, Tom. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2066.962s">Go</a>  ahead.</p>

    <p>[Ellis]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2067.784s">Thank</a>  you for inviting me today. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2070.068s">Yes,</a>  the timing of the project financing is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2074.859s">We've</a>  started the design process and have learned a lot about what the needs are for the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2079.523s">It's</a>  a very complex effort to try to keep the schools occupied, as well as make these adjustments in the mechanical systems and replacing them. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2089.911s">Basically,</a>  replacing the engine while you're trying to keep the car moving. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2093.814s">So</a>  it's going to be a challenge to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2096.076s">But</a>  to do so, we're using a construction management risk delivery method, which allows <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2101.488s">the</a>  builder to be engaged in the process because there's a lot of logistics involved with keeping the schools open, how we're going to do the work to keep it safe, to keep the air quality in the school correct as we do the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2114.718s">But</a>  to do so, we need to engage the construction manager early in 2025. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2122.249s">2025.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2123.009s">And</a>  to do so, we need the funding to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2125.03s">So</a>  we need the pre-construction services fee to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2128.491s">We</a>  need to keep the design team moving forward with additional funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2132.912s">And</a>  we also need funds for early purchasing of the mechanical equipment, and it's in excess of $3 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2140.755s">And</a>  because of the supply chain issues with mechanical systems that could take anywhere 16 to 20 weeks to whenever, we need to get that material and equipment ordered quickly and soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2153.462s">So</a>  that's the urgency involved is to get the equipment there so that we can start the work over the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2159.045s">and</a>  get most of the work done, it will continue into the fall, but to get the air conditioning systems operational. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2165.011s">So</a>  hopefully in August, the school will have air conditioning available. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2170.977s">So</a>  that's the urgency of the issue of trying to get the funding to start the work soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2175.902s">So</a>  I think that's kind of the big overview at this point.</p>

    <p>[Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2181.431s">And</a>  so I'll just, I think that this council knows this, I will sort of repeat it for the public, that in approving something like this, there would be a first reading, there would be an advertising period, and there would be a third reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2193.905s">So</a>  it wouldn't necessarily, and like this evening there was a third reading that went through very, very quickly because you were all very well briefed on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2201.253s">at</a>  the first reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2203.213s">I</a>  would respectfully request that you consider a first reading tonight and a committee of the whole in January and the advertising to be able to then consider this on the January 15th meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2214.656s">I</a>  think it's the 15th, 14th. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2217.916s">Just</a>  to keep this moving, I think your next meeting in January would be around the 31st, 28th. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2224.798s">My</a>  apologies, I didn't put a calendar up. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2227.762s">And</a>  it would be great to be able to get these things because the contracting can take a couple weeks, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2233.45s">So</a>  that's the timeline that we're really looking on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2240.114s">I</a>  had one other thing, but it slipped my mind, so sorry.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2243.675s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2243.915s">I'll</a>  go to Vice President Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2245.435s">Oh,</a>  sorry, Mr. Cushing, then Vice President Collins and Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2247.776s">I</a>  also just really want to talk about the why. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2250.396s">So</a>  as I have mentioned numerous times before the distinguished school body, the reality is that Medford still sees these buildings as the new schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2260.878s">As</a>  Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, hopefully they will be supplanted by a new Med or renovated Medford High School in a few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2269.5s">These</a>  buildings have a lifespan at 23 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2274.383s">There</a>  are significant challenges with the HVAC systems in those buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2279.346s">This</a>  project initially started with a comprehensive review of the Andrews Middle School, and not to be outdone, the McGlynn systems failed significantly more rapidly over the last few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2292.975s">There</a>  are large swaths of that building, including gyms, auditorium, cafeteria, that have little to no air conditioning whatsoever. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2300.978s">Classroom</a>  units, rooftop units that cool the classrooms have failed. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2307.821s">And</a>  the Andrews Middle School has had problems since the building was first opened. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2313.963s">It</a>  has been termed by our engineers who work on it from a vendor as just having consistent gremlins over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2322.726s">There</a>  are issues with both of these buildings that cause a substantial detriment to student learning, staff functionality, and potentially giving climate change the health and safety of our students and staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2336.271s">There's</a>  a moment to act where that can be put on the table for the upcoming FY26 academic year. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2347.194s">If</a>  we wait, if we wait, that will delay our ability to deploy these systems so that classrooms are cooled. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2355.338s">The</a>  gyms and other large areas will come online shortly thereafter, probably middle-ish of September. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2362.402s">I</a>  want to be clear that the first systems that will be completed will be the water side, which services the classrooms, and then will be the large spaces that are done by forced air. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2377.765s">I've</a>  presented in front of the school committee numerous times on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2380.766s">It</a>  has consumed a large part of the school district's energies over the past several years. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2386.267s">And</a>  I'm here to basically beg on behalf of the staff and students of these schools that we advance this project with multiple readings. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2399.721s">you'll</a>  have the opportunity to pull back if our presentations don't meet your expectations. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2404.743s">But</a>  this is what I would consider to be a moral obligation to make sure that these facilities that service our students, many of whom may be vulnerable for any number of reasons, provide the environment that is needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2419.049s">There</a>  is also, hopefully, that we can slide in ahead with some of this ordering to avoid the impending tariffs <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2427.873s">that</a>  have been described by the incoming administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2431.016s">It</a>  is a significant, the audience may laugh, but it is a significant concern of our team putting this together about what the cost implications may be moving forward.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2443.287s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Cushing. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2444.127s">I</a>  don't think anyone's excited for the 30 percent cost increases we're all about to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2448.071s">Vice</a>  President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2452.438s">Thank</a>  you for the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2454.02s">Thank</a>  you for the succinctness. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2457.743s">Certainly,</a>  I don't think that any of us think that our students and educators and school staff should be put in the position of having to beg for classrooms that are a temperature at which you can focus and deliver good education and learn and be comfortable enough to get through the day and really get something out of <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2472.857s">the</a>  education that Medford Public Schools offers. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2476.298s">And</a>  I would be really happy to work with President Bears to make sure that we can get a committee of the whole on the January schedule as quickly as possible so that we can advance this tonight, if it is the will of the council, do our due diligence, and then try to get this out the door. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2488.703s">Because</a>  I do understand, you know, I think anybody who has any passing familiarity with projects of this scale, you know, I know that we have a really tight timeframe that you're trying to get this done in so that these improvements are up and running for the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2500.167s">of</a>  the next school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2501.248s">And</a>  if we miss that window, that manifests in unhappy students and unhappy educators and unhappy families. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2507.534s">So</a>  with that, I would motion to approve for first reading and for city council leadership to work to schedule a committee of the whole for more in-depth conversation at our first opportunity in January.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2520.905s">Council</a>  Vice President Collins has motioned to approve for first reading and to schedule a committee of the whole in early January prior to third reading for a more in-depth presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2529.688s">Is</a>  there a second on that motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2530.728s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2532.929s">Several.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2533.93s">I'll</a>  go with Councilor Lazzaro and then I will go to Councilor Scarpelli for further discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2543.953s">Yeah,</a>  I'm just gonna go to Councilor Scarpelli and then Councilor</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2552.29s">Oh,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2553.05s">Can</a>  you hear me? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2554.751s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2555.252s">I</a>  can just see social media today saying, quote, Councilor Scarpelli doesn't want to keep the kids warm and the teachers cool in the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2562.315s">So</a>  let's be realistic. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2565.737s">That's</a>  number one priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2567.138s">We</a>  all know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2568.058s">But</a>  we also want to make sure that when I taught there 15 years ago, we had the same issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2574.182s">So</a>  we understand that have to get done. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2575.903s">But</a>  what I'm saying is I don't see a few weeks <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2579.349s">to</a>  track back and really understand the total process. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2582.39s">Now,</a>  all due respect, Tom, thank you for your presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2585.131s">I</a>  don't even know who you are. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2585.931s">Are</a>  we paying you? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2587.572s">Like</a>  we don't, there's processes like, you know, how is the procurement process look? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2593.874s">How</a>  are we going to, has issues with the MSBA been approved yet for 25 million? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2600.117s">Have</a>  we <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2600.877s">have</a>  we looked at other avenues do we look at the trajectory of our city's finances when we're looking to how we're going to bomb this so i think that this is this isn't something that we're saying at least this council saying that i don't want this this is council wants to just bring it back and look at this in totality not because the city school committee voted seven nothing because we have issues like the air condition is not going to work in august <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2625.196s">This</a>  is a few weeks that we slow things down and go through the process the correct way. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2629.322s">And</a>  that's to see the full health of our financial future here in the city of Medford because I'd like to know, there might be more. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2637.252s">There</a>  might be more that we don't know about because this is coming up <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2641.323s">that</a>  we have to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2641.803s">We</a>  have to look at what's relatively new and how quick this is and how much it's going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2644.586s">Where</a>  as we look forward, there might be more that the mayor has has planned, but we don't know about that says, Well, there's another five million that we have to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2652.412s">So</a>  the kids can go into a safe school. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2654.914s">Maybe</a>  something's wrong with the doors. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2656.876s">We</a>  don't know yet because we haven't been discussing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2659.658s">All</a>  we received is this this motion for a loan order and to <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2669.85s">my</a>  council vice president bring that forward and was seconded, but I won't be supporting it for the fact that I'd rather have the meeting before we put five, move $5 million that we can start the process before we know truly what our fiscal overview looks like in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2685.664s">Cause</a>  that's something that's been questioned multiple times in the last few months. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2690.028s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2691.589s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2692.049s">Councilor</a>  Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2695.273s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2696.294s">Um,</a>  I do feel comfortable voting yes on the first reading tonight, and I'll explain why I've been following this conversation for, as you've noted, this has been a conversation for years, and especially in recent months with school committee meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2710.488s">There</a>  are materials out there for us to look at and I know they haven't come straight to the city council yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2715.393s">Um,</a>  this is <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2717.976s">an</a>  issue of urgency for a lot of our students for, as you said, for health, for safety, for student performance, for functionality, for our teachers sake. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2729.518s">I</a>  know a lot of, you know, things were, in my experience, they're having problems in the past with the HVAC system from what teachers and students have told me and parents have told me that things have only gotten worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2743.48s">I</a>  think Councilor Scarpelli does raise good questions about how this fits into our financial plan going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2751.447s">And</a>  I do know that this is something that has been at the forefront of financial planning for our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2756.552s">We've</a>  known about this cost that was going to come before us for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2762.23s">for</a>  longer than I've been on the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2765.193s">But</a>  you know what, there are questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2767.535s">And</a>  I think all of us behind the rail are in agreement that a committee, the whole meeting would be good and helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2774.262s">The</a>  reason why I feel comfortable voting yes on the first reading is as you noted, votes can change. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2778.967s">We</a>  can decide to vote this down on the third reading if our answers aren't resolved or questions aren't resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2787.063s">Um,</a>  I think, functionally voting yes on a first reading tonight and both voting for cancer, Scarf Ellie's motion on lead us to very similar places, the difference being the two week gap, the, the, the potentially even more than two weeks gap. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2804.565s">that</a>  pushing this off would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2807.026s">I</a>  think it's really important to underscore to everyone watching at home and here that that time does matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2813.609s">That</a>  timeline does matter for the success of a city's project. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2818.391s">There</a>  are tons of projects out there that we've had to wait a cycle or put on hold because we weren't able to get the bids out in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2826.654s">We</a>  weren't able to do X, Y, Z. And it's really important that we meet the timelines as is. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2833.891s">I</a>  think it'd be helpful for the council going forward if we could submit some questions to city staff before the committee, the whole meeting, if we could see some of the slides before that meeting as well, just to expedite that conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2848.08s">I</a>  think we can have a very rich and deep conversation about, you know, the questions that my fellow councillors have raised about the need and urgency for this going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2858.947s">And</a>  I think we can have that depth of conversation as long as we're prepared for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2865.694s">Thank</a>  you counsel is our.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2868.456s">Thank</a>  you, thank you for your presentation, I think we can also probably watch the school committee meeting from yesterday in between now and when we have our committee of the whole and review that presentation as well which could be really beneficial to all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2880.883s">I</a>  feel comfortable voting yes for this I also think that when you mentioned the gremlins. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2885.302s">There</a>  may have been, I'm not sure if this happened, but there may have been some measures taken in the prior projects being done that we could avoid this time around. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2897.969s">Hopefully</a>  we won't have gremlins in this project and we can have just a really solid foundation with this HVAC system. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2906.354s">I</a>  would hope we could avoid that this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2909.516s">So</a>  thank you, I appreciate you coming here and presenting this. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2913.518s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2915.687s">On</a>  the motion of Vice President Collins as amended to request a committee of the whole in January, please wait, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2923.17s">On</a>  the motion of Vice President Collins to request a committee of the whole and also amended by Councilor Tseng to request the slides be shared with the council by email and also that councilors can submit questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2936.817s">Should</a>  they submit them to you Director Hunt and Assistant Superintendent Cushing directly? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2940.678s">Great,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2943.039s">Vice</a>  President Collins, do you have anything further? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2947.403s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2948.485s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2948.805s">Before</a>  we vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2949.346s">I</a>  just wanted to appreciate my Councilor discussion of this item. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2952.59s">I'm</a>  very much looking forward to the committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2954.713s">I</a>  also just wanted to follow up and <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2957.571s">to</a>  make clear just because of the way that it's being talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2961.334s">This</a>  is a request for a loan order for $5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2966.057s">I</a>  don't want people to come away with the impression that the city is, after this vote, writing a check for $5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2971.081s">That's</a>  not the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2972.722s">The</a>  loan order, you know, this is a process that we very, very, very commonly use for large capital expenses like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2979.327s">This</a>  is normal to take out a loan order for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2981.288s">It's</a>  like the way this is normally done. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2982.769s">We're</a>  not just writing a check from some <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2985.491s">city</a>  checking account. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2986.372s">That's</a>  not how this works. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2987.992s">Um,</a>  and I just, you know, I've had so many conversations with constituents about heating and cooling in MPS buildings for so many years that I really would be remiss to not just affirm that this is not a new project. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2999.437s">This</a>  is really a harm that people have been feeling for years, and I'm glad that we're acting on it now, but we're actually we're acting on it late. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3007.18s">So</a>  thank you for getting us to this point where we can be acting on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3010.362s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3011.383s">Thank</a>  you, and I know you guys wanted to maybe respond or answer any further questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3015.026s">I</a>  just wanted to note that this project has been on the radar. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3018.008s">It</a>  was in a previous capital improvement plan, and it was one of the reasons for the question six vote, because it was a large project that came up. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3028.675s">The</a>  proposed question six did not succeed, but it was why it was on the ballot.</p>

    <p>[Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3034.039s">Thank</a>  you, Council President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3036.16s">I</a>  did want to just clarify two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3038.421s">So</a>  we do actually have Bob Dickinson on the Zoom this evening because of this, if there were specific questions for him. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3045.504s">And</a>  I did just want to clarify the roles that Tom is our owner's project manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3050.766s">He</a>  was hired in June and has been working with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3053.347s">We've</a>  been meeting weekly since mid-August. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3055.908s">Our</a>  designers came on board in August. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3058.349s">We've</a>  been using ARPA funding to fund the early work on this as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3064.111s">So</a>  the designers, Dr. Cushing, myself, our climate planner, and the designers in OPM have been meeting weekly since August on this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3075.26s">We</a>  did need to get to a certain point in design. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3077.642s">We</a>  are right now at 30% design, which is complete schematics. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3083.507s">And</a>  we needed to have that information in order to know <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3087.55s">how</a>  much to ask for in this bond and how much to be able to predict in the future one. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3092.693s">So</a>  I do feel like this is why, why didn't you come like a month ago? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3096.795s">Because</a>  we needed the 30% design or also known as the schematic design to be completed before we could ask for this money. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3105.179s">And</a>  now we'll be moving into the next steps in design development. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3109.382s">I</a>  just sort of thought that was very helpful to clarify that.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3112.81s">Thank</a>  you, Director Hunt. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3113.671s">Any</a>  further questions by members of the Council for Director Hunt, Dr. Cushing, or for Director Dickinson on Zoom? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3123.6s">Seeing</a>  none, we'll go to open this up for any public comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3128.264s">You</a>  can either show up at the podium or raise your hand on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3130.826s">This</a>  is only for this paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3132.588s">If</a>  you have comment on this specific paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3135.631s">Seeing</a>  no hands on Zoom, we'll go to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3137.532s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3138.553s">You</a>  have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Nuzzo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3140.792s">Hi,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3141.333s">I</a>  don't need three minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3142.695s">My</a>  name is Jean Nuzzo. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3143.536s">I</a>  live at Parr Street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3145.398s">I</a>  just have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3146.52s">I'd</a>  like to know where the technical documentation and feasibility study and projected budget for this can be found for consumption. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3154.069s">Is</a>  it available online or does a FOIA request need to be submitted?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3158.697s">I</a>  believe the materials are available in the school committee packet from last night. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3162.941s">I'll</a>  defer to Director Hunt.</p>

    <p>[Nuzzo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3164.001s">The</a>  technical documents? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3165.423s">I'm</a>  sorry, I'm deferring to, excuse me.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3167.304s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3167.664s">Director</a>  Hunt, do you have an answer to that question? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3169.766s">Or</a>  Mr. Ellis?</p>

    <p>[Nuzzo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3172.088s">And</a>  the feasibility study through the chair.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3175.31s">You</a>  need to speak into the microphone. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3177.552s">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ellis]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3179.053s">Sure,</a>  yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3179.593s">The</a>  feasibility study was initially done, I believe it was over a year ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3184.537s">So</a>  that document is <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3186.03s">is</a>  available. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3186.85s">I</a>  don't know exactly where. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3188.551s">I</a>  didn't put it on the web.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3190.612s">But</a>  it's on the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3191.552s">It</a>  was considered by the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3192.913s">It's</a>  on the school website.</p>

    <p>[Ellis]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3193.813s">It's</a>  a public document because it's part of our solicitation. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3197.995s">So</a>  yes, that information is out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3199.896s">We</a>  just received the schematic design documents from the design team. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3203.838s">So</a>  that's being used right now as a process. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3205.979s">We</a>  haven't posted that anywhere at this time.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3208.24s">But</a>  it will be posted on the Medford Public Schools website.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3214.082s">So</a>  we have not contemplated right now how we're going to publicize and follow through with this, but we will, as we've done in previous projects, and as you'll see coming up in a few days here, right now the Brooks is going through a complete hot water replacement because that failed back in May. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3234.648s">Thank</a>  you very much for supporting that effort as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3237.55s">You'll</a>  be seeing pictures and you'll be seeing that project being updated on our Facebook page. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3242.993s">And</a>  we will also have the construction page somewhere on our website. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3246.375s">I'm</a>  happy to put all the documents up. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3248.556s">They</a>  are mostly on the school committee page. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3253.399s">So</a>  if you go and you search the school committee package, you're able to find it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3256.861s">Person</a>  does not need to file a four-year request. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3258.862s">I'm</a>  happy to share anyone who wants to go through schematic design documents and electrical engineering documents. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3264.186s">I</a>  welcome it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3265.227s">Maybe</a>  they can find some efficiencies.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3267.311s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nuzzo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3267.731s">I</a>  would, and thank you for the answer.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3269.855s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3270.416s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Cushing. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3272.018s">Is</a>  your email pcushing at medford.k12.ma.us? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3274.963s">It</a>  is. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3275.184s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3278.815s">Any</a>  further public comments, name and address for the record please you have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Merritt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3284.48s">Nate</a>  Merritt, 373 Riverside Ave. I'm sure everyone's aware that, you know, the members of the city residents are maybe a little nervous concern you know upcoming tax hikes and all that, want to make sure that our dollars are spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3296.525s">most</a>  efficiently possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3298.365s">Was</a>  there a course of action given for just say replacement of the existing systems that, you know, replacement parts versus upgrades and it's not clear from the paper, what's an upgrade? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3311.748s">Is</a>  it, you know, is the roof currently leaking now or is the roof upgrade because of the solar panel installation that's also planned and is that an upgrade versus replacing the parts that are broken for the system? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3324.71s">And</a>  was there a cost associated with that, like a spectrum? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3328.538s">Option</a>  A, $5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3330.001s">Option</a>  B, $15 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3331.564s">Option</a>  C is what we have here, which is what, $25 million?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3336.847s">My</a>  understanding is a feasibility study was conducted, and I'll leave the specifics to Dr. Cushing.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3342.409s">So</a>  we recently had an infrared scan. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3344.85s">We</a>  first had a visual inspection of the McGlynn roof completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3348.371s">We</a>  then had an infrared scan. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3350.431s">The</a>  visual inspection by our roofing contractor who does this work felt that the roof was probably 10% wet, as it's termed. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3360.414s">The</a>  infrared scan revealed 25% wetness. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3364.215s">So</a>  the roof needs significant work as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3367.397s">As</a>  part of this project, we examined the costs associated with a full roof replacement, which under the 2011 building code standards would increase the level of insulation. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3378.263s">We</a>  then had Brenda Pike crunch the numbers on that to see what the cost savings over the 20 year life of the roof would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3386.207s">And</a>  it pales in comparison to the cost of a replacement. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3389.289s">What</a>  we can do is a refurbishment, a treatment, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3393.091s">Similar</a>  to what director hunt led about five years ago now, four years ago now at the Andrews Middle School which is called a white knight application, which they go in they repair the wet spots they repair any damage to the roof, and then they put essentially for lack of a better term, a film heavily durable film that has a 20 year warranty on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3414.575s">So</a>  that's what we will more than likely do at the McGlynn at 50% the cost same warranty same lifespan 50% the cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3423.037s">So,</a>  to answer that question on the roof. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3426.358s">Also,</a>  to speak directly to your question around, you know, could these units be repaired. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3432.02s">Unfortunately,</a>  no. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3434.061s">The</a>  Environmental Protection Agency has banned the manufacture and importation of the refrigerant that powers these units. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3444.051s">The</a>  refrigerant that powers these units is R22 refrigerant. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3448.035s">It</a>  was banned about <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3450.506s">Four</a>  and a half years ago at this point, sorry, I used to be a real academic person and help lift schools out of turnaround. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3457.929s">I</a>  now know HVAC and other systems which it's just part of what school systems do. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3463.472s">So</a>  R22 was banned, I think it was during 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3466.973s">We</a>  did significant work on the Roberts, the Misatoch, and the Brooks in the summer of 2019 to replace a significant amount of compressors. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3476.902s">That</a>  was funded by a free cash award just prior to my arrival in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3482.907s">These</a>  systems operating on R22 would be cost prohibitive <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3488.132s">All</a>  right, the only way to get R-22 is to reclaim it from other units that are being decommissioned or from existing stores. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3498.061s">The</a>  costs associated with that are exorbitant. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3501.704s">I</a>  have actually the numbers in a previous school committee report. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3504.327s">They're</a>  just slipping me right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3506.108s">So</a>  to do any type of repair or upgrade on, I'm sorry, any type of repair or retrofit of these units really kicks the can down the road and leads us to maintaining 23-year-old systems that are unfortunately at the end of their lifespan.</p>

    <p>[Merritt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3526.613s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3530.081s">And</a>  to that, that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3531.201s">And</a>  I think, you know, please don't misunderstand. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3533.302s">I</a>  want schools to, right, but just saying form fit replacement versus the solar panels that weren't there, that's an upgrade. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3542.267s">Is</a>  there a dollar cost? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3543.387s">How</a>  many dollars is that, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3545.949s">Are</a>  there other upgrades? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3546.869s">If</a>  they make sense, that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3548.27s">Just</a>  hoping that that cost breakdown for those options has been presented so people can understand the rationale. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3554.693s">And</a>  if it makes sense to buy, buy. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3556.594s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3557.675s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3559.229s">I</a>  will just share that the full feasibility study looks at these sorts of comparisons of various items, but does address the fact that a retrofit is just not possible, really, at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3570.776s">An</a>  interesting thing with the solar is that we are putting it forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3575.939s">I</a>  am recommending it as an ad alternate on this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3579.021s">And</a>  that is actually because what I have done when we've worked on the last several construction projects, the police, the library, et cetera, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3585.525s">When</a>  solar is an ad alternate, it comes in at a much lower price than if it was a standalone project, and it comes in surprisingly low, typically because the electrical sub doesn't want to lose the work, and so they give a really good price on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3599.394s">So</a>  we will put it forward as an ad alternate. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3601.316s">If</a>  it comes in as too pricey or there's some issue with it, then we'll hold that for a later separately funded project. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3608.18s">If</a>  it comes in at a significantly good price, which is in fact what happened with the police and the library, then we would move forward with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3615.585s">So</a>  I just felt that that was useful to know up front. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3618.126s">But</a>  these are also some of the things that we would get into both in a short committee of the whole, but also in an in-depth one when we are at 100% design.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3627.089s">It</a>  sounds like it's fair to say that maximizing the lifespan, minimizing the cost, and maximizing the efficiency of this project has been the touchstone of the feasibility study and the design process. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3639.013s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3640.512s">I'd</a>  also like to say that through our meeting since August, we've had to make serious decisions about this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3648.473s">And</a>  the two things guiding our work are energy efficiency, all right, and making sure that we're helping Medford meet its climate goals, but also fiscal responsibility to the taxpayers of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3661.496s">We've</a>  made conscientious decisions on this project for these two schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3668.357s">that</a>  are fiscally responsible and, you know, sacrifice quicker delivery in some cases and extend the timeline a little bit because of the extraordinarily high cost for that quicker delivery of certain units.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3686.456s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3687.957s">Seeing</a>  no hands on Zoom, we'll go to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3689.699s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3690.74s">You</a>  have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Vienneau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3692.389s">Hi,</a>  my name is Lisa Vienneau and I live at 19 Paul Road in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3697.194s">I</a>  was just wondering where this problem has existed for a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3700.898s">How</a>  extensively or creatively have you looked for resources on the <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3706.877s">federal</a>  level, on the private level to fund this or to help fund this project so that it doesn't always just lean on the taxpayer to have to pay it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3717.663s">Just</a>  curious where it's been around for at least five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3721.385s">You've</a>  had time to think, oh, perhaps <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3724.167s">we</a>  should look for funding in other places, not just locally in the city, but maybe federal or private. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3733.795s">I</a>  don't know if construction is considered a way to get funding, but I'm just curious about that.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3741.06s">My</a>  understanding, and I'm sure Dr. Cushing and Director Hunt can add to it, is that federal money has been used up until this point to fund the process up until this point, the federal ARPA money that came to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3752.889s">and</a>  there's not really private grants out there for this kind of project. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3757.193s">And</a>  also I believe it was presented to the school committee that the MSBA was approached and they said that this project wouldn't apply under the MSBA, but.</p>

    <p>[Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3764.077s">So</a>  I think that a full robust answer on this, I would like to defer to the committee of the whole, because I would be happy to go on at length about the difficulty with federal funding where we apply for grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3774.685s">I</a>  think it's too much for tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3776.246s">Suffice</a>  it to say, Brendan and I have been looking at that for two and a half years. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3781.65s">The</a>  MSBA is not eligible because we are working on a new school, the new high school, and they said we could not fund this project with MSBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3790.433s">At</a>  the same time, we would have to put the new high school on hold. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3793.654s">Nobody</a>  is willing to put the new high school on hold. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3795.815s">Nobody</a>  is willing to work in a building without air conditioning. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3799.937s">in</a>  buildings that were designed for air conditioning. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3801.879s">So</a>  that's a problem with MSBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3804.341s">We've</a>  looked at smaller grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3806.623s">When</a>  you're looking at a project of this scale, some of the smaller things that are available barely touch this project.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3815.687s">So</a>  the mass MSBA is the Massachusetts School Building Authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3819.188s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3819.908s">And</a>  that's the that's the funding authority that will hopefully fund a large portion of the work that's expected to be done in Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3829.231s">Also,</a>  over the past several years, as everyone is aware, construction costs have spiked excessively. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3838.594s">And</a>  that actually caused several projects in Massachusetts under MSBA authority to either pause their deployment or to refigure their plans into what's called value engineer, eliminate things as the construction moved forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3856.938s">MSBA</a>  also shut down several of their programs over the last several years to make sure that funding was being driven to the core program. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3866.42s">MSBA</a>  is considering and I understand will be reopening some accelerated repair projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3873.383s">That</a>  funding would be for over two years from now, which means another two plus heating seasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3880.906s">And</a>  we're considering those for future work with our other schools that are of similar age. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3888.028s">The</a>  timeline does not fit for these schools where the systems have largely failed.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3894.52s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Cushing.</p>

    <p>[Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3896.16s">Tom</a>  reminded me that we do anticipate $2.5 million in utility rebates on this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3901.822s">So</a>  I just want to put that out there.</p>

    <p>[McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4023.823s">Wonderful.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4024.763s">Hello,</a>  everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4025.823s">Thank</a>  you for taking this on tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4028.844s">So</a>  this is relatively simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4030.645s">So</a>  we are running out of money that we have set aside for our lead line rebate program. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4037.466s">And</a>  we are trying to actually change that program, how we do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4041.147s">But</a>  we're waiting for some information on a grant that we're trying to get from the EPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4046.485s">So</a>  in the meantime, we need a little bit more money to help that account. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4051.248s">And</a>  that number is 100,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4052.468s">So</a>  we think that'll hold us over until we know more information on how we're either going to continue this program or change it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4061.774s">I'm</a>  happy to answer questions on our plans or whatever comes up.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4065.896s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4066.156s">I'm</a>  going to Vice President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4068.971s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4069.711s">Thank</a>  you, Commissioner McGibbon for being with us this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4072.432s">I</a>  know that the lead line replacement rebate program is something that I've heard a lot about from a lot of constituents. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4078.715s">I</a>  think there's a lot of enthusiasm for this program as homeowners are really happy to know that there are rebates available for replacing lead lines that really ought to be replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4088.138s">So</a>  thank you for your work on that program in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4092.26s">I</a>  think that this is a really worthy program and it makes sense to use monies from the Water and Sewer Stabilization Fund, which, you know, is a way of making sure that our retained earnings can remain useful throughout the year to be put towards this. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4103.488s">And</a>  it sounds to me like it's, you know, essentially just a stopgap, a kind of safety measure until hopefully some federal monies start to augment that program as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4115.396s">So</a>  I would happy to make a motion to approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4117.598s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4119.875s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4120.276s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Collins to approve, seconded by Councilor Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4123.261s">Any</a>  further discussion by members of the Council? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4127.83s">Seeing</a>  none, is there any discussion by members of the public on the lead line? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4130.775s">Oh,</a>  Councilor Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4133.615s">Real</a>  quick, this was something that I have dealt with a lot being a renter, living in a lot of different houses, all of which I led when my child was under six years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4143.101s">And</a>  I do think that it's crucially important. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4147.364s">I'm</a>  very excited that Medford is incentivizing people and giving people this opportunity to get those fixed and providing a little bit of help with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4154.708s">I</a>  also understand that this is simply <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4157.85s">putting</a>  it in place so that it can be used by the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4162.133s">Obviously,</a>  that'll depend on how many applications come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4164.575s">So</a>  I'm very happy to support this.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4306.621s">Thank</a>  you, Council President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4308.022s">Thanks</a>  for allowing this to go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4309.922s">I</a>  think that as we've spoken about in the past, I think that with the passing of the override, I think every dollar that is going to come through the city coffers I'm going to bring forward because of the lack of transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4325.467s">You'll</a>  see that there's a trend tonight as we look at different resolutions that lack of transparency or <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4336.027s">lack</a>  of information for our residents to understand the process as we move forward have been a big issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4343.211s">So</a>  I think that understanding phone calls I received as soon as we get the news that the superintendent's contract has just been bought out, and mutually, by the way, I don't know what that means, but when you have someone for a contract, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4361.022s">so</a>  especially someone that's worked so hard for the community you'd want to see that to the end and i think that not knowing what that that number is that dollar number is and how much these ramifications are going to hit our community i think it's important when you have all these questions about the override and where the money's going where it's truly going and as the mayor said she would have a transparent process i'm just moving this forward to ask that we get a detailed report from the mayor's office <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4388.612s">And,</a>  uh, describing the cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4392.438s">Um</a>  impact that's going to hit this city by paying off a superintendent, um, to go home now and, um. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4403.399s">collective</a>  paycheck to do nothing while we're now moving an assistant superintendent forward an interim role and what that cost will be in the trickle down effect to costs that are going to have to now pick up her slack financially in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4417.024s">So,</a>  um, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4419.005s">This</a>  isn't a secret. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4421.126s">I</a>  hope no one here is offended. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4422.987s">I</a>  told everybody here I will question every single penny moving forward, especially after the override vote and anything that would be a little questionable when it comes to processes that as soon as the override is passed, we settle a buyout for a superintendent to move her out. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4442.676s">So</a>  I think that is going to be super important that we have that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4447.339s">So</a>  I request that from our administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4451.024s">The</a>  second is I'm glad to hear that Mia did respond back to us about our bond rating for Moody's that people didn't know that <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4462.091s">we</a>  were taken off the bond rating by Moody's, one of our investment companies that give us our bond rating because of some technical issues with filing. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4474.78s">I</a>  believe I was told, I'm not sure, but I think that we're here that <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4480.004s">that</a>  is back on, we're back on top and our bond rating has been restored. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4484.468s">It's</a>  also good to know that we truly don't use Moody's too often or if any, when we look at our bonds, but I think it's important that when something goes out, especially when we're talking about what? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4496.759s">financial</a>  mismanagement, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4498.801s">And</a>  what do we hear? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4499.802s">All</a>  of a sudden, Moody's has dropped Medford because of A, B and C. So I appreciate the mayor's response today, letting us know that that has been restored. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4510.692s">But</a>  I would amend this paper, if we could, to ask a report to be presented to the City Council on the reasoning why <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4518.886s">we</a>  would lose a bond rating, because I think that's more alarming in totality to not just getting the bond back. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4527.694s">I</a>  think, yay, we got it back. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4528.855s">But</a>  I think what's important, we talk about the issues we had, especially during the time of the override. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4533.959s">We</a>  talked about mismanagement of our city's finances. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4536.521s">So</a>  I think that we need to see if we can, Mr. President, to amend the paper to ask for that report. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4545.309s">I</a>  would appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4547.951s">Next</a>  is to be resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4549.432s">The</a>  city administration cease and desist the use of private investigators. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4553.515s">I</a>  was told that we have had multiple employees that under contract are being followed by private investigators, and this is getting to be a real problem because what's happening in our community, whether you want to see it or not, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4570.991s">Our</a>  community is being divided in so many different levels, and the administration is the catalyst behind this. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4576.753s">And</a>  we're seeing practices of following hard-working members of our community off of rumors to follow them around the Commonwealth to see if they're doing something wrong during their contractual sick days, and that's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4594.085s">I'm</a>  sure everybody here has said and they fight for unions. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4596.786s">But</a>  if you truly fight for unions, I hope you stand with me to get a true indication of where our tax dollars are going. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4603.508s">Because</a>  if these rumors again, the reason why we hear the mayor is sent out private investigators because of rumors. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4610.73s">And</a>  I as one Councilor, if we're going to play that game, I am now responding to rumors. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4617.321s">that</a>  I want to report back. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4618.983s">If</a>  this is a practice, I need an update and understand the cost that's attributed to these these, um, these private investigators and where what line item they're coming from and <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4633.241s">want</a>  a full report, what this practice, how much it's cost us from the beginning to the end, and if they have found anything dealing with any private investigators. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4642.427s">I</a>  know that, you know, we have one DPW member that's now gone, that has settled for a big number, that's, he's home now, counting his money. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4651.953s">And</a>  I think that was one of the instances that, looking back, I'd love to see what it's cost us. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4657.036s">Again,</a>  I'm gonna bring it forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4660.856s">We</a>  had an override, $500,000 to fix all of our streets and sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4665.538s">Well,</a>  let's see where this money is going. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4667.459s">So</a>  I think this is important that we see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4669.501s">And</a>  last but not least, what I heard the other day, I find it appalling. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4673.182s">And</a>  I think that this is, again, another example of the division of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4680.632s">Everybody</a>  wants that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4681.632s">What</a>  do we have the other day? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4682.993s">We</a>  have DPW members. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4684.914s">We</a>  were commending DPW members because of their hard work and their commitment to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4690.395s">But</a>  in the same breath, we're gonna hear that in this resolution that just the other day, I was informed that I believe 45 DPW members, staff members were brought in to do drug testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4707.742s">And</a>  that's a blatant <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4709.482s">blatant</a>  problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4712.063s">So</a>  my question that I can ask right now is how much did it cost us? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4716.445s">And</a>  what do we find with these these these processes? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4721.287s">Because</a>  I think it's important that we need to know because these members that are here are the people that get up every day and go to work without any question. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4729.711s">Now</a>  they're understaffed. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4731.131s">They're</a>  underpaid. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4733.266s">These</a>  are the people that, remember, we plotted because, what, while everybody was sleeping and doors were shut and everything was buckled down during the pandemic? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4742.389s">Well,</a>  they were fired, there were police, and there were DPW workers that were killing themselves every single day for this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4748.27s">So</a>  I know the mayor talks about the pandemic, and we want to talk about it when it sounds good, but these men and women, what happened last week, that's a serious problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4756.432s">And</a>  for one member of this leadership team in this city, I think that we have to have <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4762.558s">emotion.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4763.079s">We</a>  have to have information that stops this from happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4766.083s">Enough</a>  is enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4768.245s">Our</a>  city is damaged. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4769.767s">Our</a>  state is damaged. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4770.788s">Our</a>  nation is damaged as it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4772.35s">We</a>  don't need any more. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4775.214s">So</a>  I know that there is a representative here from the Teamsters that's represented the union that could explain some important information. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4781.536s">And</a>  I welcome that when it's time, Council President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4784.457s">But</a>  again, I think it's important for this council right now to understand this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4789.158s">And</a>  we all know that, you know, we can't come from the city because of personnel issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4793.319s">But</a>  I will tell you what I can ask for is what the funding what it costs this this community by I believe it was drug testing and alcohol testing, I believe, for <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4805.783s">all</a>  of the city employees that were, by the way, working on our streets, in our schools, in our parks, on our sidewalks, that were called back to the yard, that had to sit in a room and then be embarrassed and disgraced to get drug tested for no reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4825.007s">So</a>  again, Mr. President, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4827.407s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4828.248s">I</a>  have two documents from the administration that I'll read, and then I'll go to members of the council, and then we can go to public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4836.052s">First,</a>  I was on the bond rating we received a message from the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4839.935s">Hello</a>  President Bears and city council members after a great deal of preparation and bond rating call last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4845.098s">I'm</a>  pleased to report that our a three bond rating was reaffirmed by Moody's financial services company upon receiving updated documentation related to our fiscal year 23 audit. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4854.805s">As</a>  you're likely aware the AA3 rating is regarded as a quote high grade rating and per Moody's analysis the city is in line for an elevated credit rating in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4863.788s">You</a>  can read about Moody's outlook on the city's financial health and borrowing strength in a press release on the city website. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4869.469s">While</a>  this is welcome news it comes with opportunities for us to shore up our financial reporting operations and strive to increase our rating in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4876.011s">If</a>  you have any questions please feel free to contact my office. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4880.196s">We</a>  then also received a message regarding Council Resolution 24518, which is what we're currently considering. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4887.358s">The</a>  mayor said, hello, President Bears, I wanted to provide some insight on Council Resolution 24518. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4891.139s">Quote,</a>  my responsibility as mayor is to the residents and taxpayers of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4896.6s">When</a>  I receive allegations from multiple parties alleging various employee matters, including potential misconduct, fraud, et cetera, I believe our community expects that I investigate these allegations to the fullest extent possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4907.603s">Additionally,</a>  depending on the specific nature of the allegations at issue, our human resources department does not have the bandwidth to undertake investigations that are broad in scope or are too cumbersome that such efforts would impede daily office duties and responsibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4920.705s">Also,</a>  as it relates to school items, please refer all school matters to the school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4925.066s">With</a>  respect to the portion of the proposed resolution pertaining to drug testing, this is a confidential personnel matter and due to individual privacy considerations, we cannot comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4933.487s">If</a>  you have any questions, feel free to contact me. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4937.318s">Brianna</a>  Lugo, current mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4941.88s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4942.48s">Any</a>  and if any other Councilors, please, you know, just signal if you'd like to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4947.123s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4948.103s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4948.603s">So,</a>  Clarity, you're saying the mayor says that so to ask for a a report from the school department, is she is she saying that <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4959.136s">Are</a>  we going to get a report financially so we can understand the ramifications financially for buying out the superintendent? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4966.357s">I</a>  know that you have nothing to do with it, but did she give you any indication? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4969.298s">Because</a>  to me it sounds like, you know, go pound sand. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4972.558s">We're</a>  moving on.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4973.659s">It</a>  says, as it relates to school items, please refer school matters to the school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4977.819s">That's</a>  what the email says. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4979.06s">So</a>  we can send requests to the school.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4981.82s">As</a>  the budgetary stewards of this community that vote on that budget, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4986.753s">I'm</a>  demanding a report, Council President, if you may, to the mayor to break down the financial ramifications of the buyout to the superintendent and what that means to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4998.744s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4999.604s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5000.705s">Any</a>  further questions or comments? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5002.227s">Councilor,</a>  Vice President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5005.253s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5006.134s">I</a>  appreciate the discussion being put forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5008.697s">I</a>  do wish that these topics were separated into disparate resolutions so we could take them up individually and vote on them individually. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5013.862s">A</a>  lot to get into here, but I do just feel that we need to <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5020.569s">be</a>  more clear with the language that we're using. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5022.871s">And</a>  I didn't want people to use, I wouldn't want people to leave the meeting thinking that the city has offered the superintendent a buyout. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5029.977s">That's</a>  not accurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5031.018s">It's</a>  my understanding again, we are not the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5033.3s">I</a>  don't think that we should be taking up matters that are germane to the school committee because that is not our body. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5038.164s">Um,</a>  but it is my understanding that it is pretty common when a superintendent contract is not renewed that the superintendent does step back from the full extent of their responsibilities before their contract is officially over to allow for that transition. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5052.774s">This</a>  isn't abnormal. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5053.814s">It</a>  doesn't indicate that there's any sort of expensive <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5058.314s">illicit,</a>  fraudulent buyout going on, I think that this is normal. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5062.436s">So</a>  I want to put that out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5063.856s">I</a>  wouldn't, you know, I know that sometimes using these words makes for better TV, but I don't think that it's respectful to the residents to mischaracterize what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5073.78s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5075.114s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5076.535s">Any</a>  further comments from members of the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5078.596s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5079.697s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5079.957s">I</a>  don't want to get the tip of tap, but as the mayor just said in her response, when you hear a rumor, she takes up full responsibility to make sure we know what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5090.043s">As</a>  fiscal stewards of this community, when the city council, when the school committee mutually ends a contract, and yes, there is a bio with it, there is a financial <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5103.647s">a</a>  financial responsibility to the city by the superintendent leaving early. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5108.569s">This</a>  is why I'm asking for the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5110.31s">This</a>  is why I'm asking the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5111.971s">I'm</a>  not asking for anything bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5113.032s">I'm</a>  not saying anybody did anything wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5114.773s">All</a>  I'm asking for is a report so we can see what the financial ramifications are <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5120.655s">by</a>  having this buyout, not just with the superintendent, whatever it costs us, if it costs us anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5125.657s">They</a>  come back and say it costs us nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5127.718s">But</a>  what is it going to cost us for an interim? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5130.88s">What's</a>  that increase? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5132.08s">What</a>  is the trickle-down effect? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5133.281s">Who's</a>  going to take up those responsibilities? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5135.201s">Who's</a>  going to pay those people? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5137.042s">Are</a>  they going to get paid? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5138.263s">So</a>  I don't think this is something that's very confusing. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5141.344s">This,</a>  believe me, this is pretty clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5144.866s">So</a>  when I asked for a resolution, the resolution doesn't seem to be too dumbfounding, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5149.568s">I</a>  think it's pretty self-explanatory. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5151.389s">All</a>  this council is asking for, ladies and gentlemen, is just a report on the breakdown of the mutual buyout or the mutual dismissal of the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5161.093s">That's</a>  all. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5165.225s">I'm</a>  not trying to make this more than it is.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5166.486s">I'll</a>  go to Councilor Tseng and Councilor Callaghan. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5170.709s">Councilor</a>  Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5172.911s">I</a>  believe Councilor Callaghan. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5175.153s">Sorry,</a>  I didn't see the order.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5176.213s">Councilor</a>  Callaghan.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5177.962s">I</a>  actually would make a motion to sever. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5179.903s">I</a>  would sever it into five. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5181.203s">Perhaps</a>  we can do that after public discussion or whatever before or after either one is fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5186.504s">But</a>  I think there's one that's about the essentially lines two and four, which are the cost of terminating. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5194.246s">Then</a>  the one in the middle, that line three, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5198.207s">Uh</a>  inviting all communications. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5199.708s">I</a>  think that's a a separate one. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5202.209s">Um</a>  there's a question of the bond rating is a third. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5205.651s">The</a>  question of the private investigators is the fourth and the question of the drug testing is a fifth. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5210.313s">That</a>  would be my suggestion to sever it into those five.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5213.255s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5213.555s">Yeah,</a>  we can take that up when we move to the voting if that's okay so we can hear just since it was presented as one, I think it's fair to hear it as one.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5222.557s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5224.44s">I</a>  believe that what is more confusing to me, and I believe I'll... <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5229.304s">is</a>  also confusing to people at home, is using the word buyout for something that I assume is quite contractual. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5236.167s">If</a>  the criticism, and I understand Councilor Scarpelli is not saying that anyone has necessarily done anything wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5244.79s">And,</a>  you know, it's always good to have more information, but I do, I think the word is what is confusing, but not the resolution itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5255.638s">When</a>  it comes to the topic of the school superintendent I think it's really important to preface anything by saying that there is a clear separation of powers in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5264.726s">When</a>  it comes to school governance. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5266.788s">However,</a>  I understand where the Councilors coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5270.971s">I</a>  just, I worry that we slip into a logical situation where, you know, this is the standard procedure right, the school board the school committee chooses not to renew something, the contract with the superintendent, and there's a transition period. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5287.548s">This</a>  is also from my understanding very standard. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5290.952s">Now,</a>  if we, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5293.599s">If</a>  the school committee, and that's up to their discretion, doesn't want to renew a contract with the superintendent, this is the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5300.585s">There</a>  isn't any other way that we could do it that would cost less. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5305.49s">And</a>  if there then becomes criticism that this is how it was done, then we foreclose any accountability we have over a hypothetical superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5315.138s">So</a>  that's that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5316.7s">And</a>  I haven't decided. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5320.103s">I</a>  think that's just my logical qualm with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5323.685s">But</a>  I understand the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5325.506s">I</a>  understand that it wasn't meant poorly. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5329.668s">With</a>  regards to, and I'll be brief about everything else because I understand there are folks in the audience who want to talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5337.513s">I</a>  do think it's important that in the administration of the city and how we carry out our duties, I understand the need for accountability. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5346.398s">I</a>  also understand that we, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5349.848s">we</a>  have a responsibility to the dignity of our workers as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5354.091s">I'll</a>  keep it simple in that, at that, because I know there are a lot of people here who are looking to give us more information to speak as well.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5365.459s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5365.86s">Any</a>  further comment by members of the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5367.961s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5370.223s">I</a>  just think that, I think I'll say it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5372.725s">And</a>  I, and I, for what this community has just gone through in November, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5378.331s">I</a>  think it's important that we do question everything because everybody's asking. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5384.873s">So</a>  either it's on the city side, school side, it comes, it's coming out of our city's budget and there are questions that aren't being asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5393.537s">So</a>  when residents come to me and say, what are the implications financially, especially after an override, it just doesn't smell right. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5401.199s">That's</a>  why I'm saying these are the, these are the important things that all that is, is just, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5405.968s">showing</a>  the information, understanding the information moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5409.49s">So</a>  when we talk about accountability, don't you think it's about time that the mayor is held accountable? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5414.953s">I</a>  mean, don't we think that this administration is held accountable? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5419.696s">This</a>  is the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5421.857s">So</a>  she's getting a free pass by hiding behind different levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5427.28s">And</a>  the bottom line is enough is enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5429.942s">We</a>  need to fix this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5431.643s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Campbell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5460.575s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5462.035s">My</a>  name is Nancy Campbell, 544 Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5465.416s">I'm</a>  a field representative with the Teamsters Local 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5469.177s">I'm</a>  one of three agents assigned to represent the City of Medford Union employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5475.518s">We're</a>  here today because this past week, the mayor singled out our DPW workers, violating their rights, and broke the law again. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5484.71s">This</a>  time the mayor demanded that 28 of our DPW members, almost the entire bargaining unit, take a mandatory drug test. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5493.053s">The</a>  28 DPW members were lined up outside in broad daylight for all the world to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5499.395s">One</a>  by one, they were loaded into the back of a drug testing van like criminals. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5504.844s">They</a>  were forced to sign away their rights, a violation of mass DOT regulations, and then they were told to pee in a cup with a stranger peering over their shoulder. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5515.408s">The</a>  stranger took each test in rapid succession with so much as non-sanitizing his hands between each. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5526.592s">This</a>  sort of mass drug testing is unheard of. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5530.473s">It</a>  was humiliating, inhumane, and illegal. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5535.359s">To</a>  be clear, there was absolutely no just cause or reasonable suspicion for any of these members to be tested, let alone all 28 of them at once. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5546.243s">By</a>  the mayor's own account, a single unused needle found in the bathroom on Monday morning justified the mass testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5556.667s">But</a>  let's call a spade a spade here. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5559.048s">The</a>  bathroom where the needle was found <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5561.946s">wasn't</a>  only used by DPW workers. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5566.228s">It</a>  was used by the public and other city employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5569.87s">So</a>  why then were only DPW workers singled out? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5574.913s">I'm</a>  sure the mayor will be scrambling around to come up with a good answer for that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5580.155s">The</a>  mayor's despicable actions last week demonstrated poor leadership, bad judgment, and a failed labor relation policy that has become typical for her administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5592.517s">but</a>  that serves absolutely no one but the management attorneys who line their pockets with taxpayer dollars defending the mayor's unlawful actions. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5604.022s">In</a>  one fell swoop, the mayor managed to violate the collective bargaining agreement, state labor law, DOT regulations, the city's own drug policy, and most importantly, the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5617.427s">Constitution.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5619.128s">The</a>  Fourth Amendment protects all citizens from unreasonable government search and seizure. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5625.211s">If</a>  a police officer wants to give somebody a breathalyzer to see whether they have been drinking and driving, they need probable cause, reasonable suspicion. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5635.617s">They</a>  can't just shove a tube down their throat because they feel like it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5639.8s">And</a>  they certainly can't start pulling over random passerby after finding a single beer can on the side of the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5648.277s">Yet</a>  here in MedFed, that effectively is exactly what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5652.68s">Without</a>  reasonable bias whatsoever, upon finding a single unused needle in a public bathroom, the mayor subjected 28 city employees to drug tests. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5664.528s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5665.528s">Because</a>  she felt like it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5668.439s">She</a>  did not have any reason or evidence to suspect that any of the needles belonging to any one of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5674.983s">So</a>  it should come as no surprise that the drug test results show that every single tested employee passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5684.149s">Again,</a>  I wanna be clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5686.231s">Every</a>  single employee who was tested passed not only a drug test, but also a breathalyzer. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5692.995s">Not</a>  one of our members showed up to work <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5695.877s">under</a>  the influence of drug or alcohol. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5698.86s">Here</a>  in Medford, you have a mayor who thinks she is above the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5702.262s">You</a>  have a mayor who thinks the US Constitution means absolutely nothing.</p>

    <p>[Campbell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5708.325s">The</a>  mayor, an attorney by trade, feels as though these employees, citizens of Medford, should not be afforded the same rights as all Americans. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5717.188s">But</a>  to our members, who were the ones subjected to the embarrassment of being forced to take these invasive tests against their will or lose their job in the face of embarrassment of residents thinking that these hardworking men <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5733.234s">dedicated</a>  in keeping your city street running safely are using drugs at work. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5738.438s">Under</a>  the mayor's tenure, the city has already spent hundreds of thousands of dollars fighting unions across the city rather than giving them fair wage adjustment and benefits. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5748.604s">The</a>  message is clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5749.905s">The</a>  mayor would rather spend your money fighting her employees than supporting them. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5754.829s">The</a>  council spends time talking about the council, the mayor, the school committee raises, but no one <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5761.593s">No</a>  one discusses the regular employees like police, fire, dispatchers, Teamster employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5767.037s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5768.077s">She</a>  got three raises this year, but she doesn't think they deserve one.</p>

experience that they felt very uncomfortable and felt was unjust. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6303.584s">We've</a>  heard that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6304.645s">We</a>  have a short response from the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6307.429s">I'm</a>  going to guess that most of the people behind this rail would like to learn more about what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6312.252s">And</a>  also just to be honest and direct, our role in this process is we do not, I am not the boss of any employee in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6319.617s">No</a>  one behind this rail is the manager of any employee in the city, except for this person right next to us is the only person in the city who works for the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6327.562s">Everybody</a>  else who works for the city of Medford works for the mayor of Medford or the superintendent of schools of the Medford public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6334.927s">So</a>  that's the role that we play here. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6338.01s">I'm</a>  sure many of us would feel dismayed and feel that the experience that was described by the representative was not something that they would want to go through. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6345.578s">I</a>  think everyone in the crowd would probably say the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6349.022s">Now</a>  the rest of the facts that come out of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6351.724s">We</a>  don't know all the answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6352.985s">We</a>  just have what has been presented so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6355.908s">And</a>  our action simply would be to say, we do not like that you did that mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6360.452s">When</a>  we talk about accountability for the mayor, that happens at the ballot box every two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6365.376s">And</a>  that is how she's held accountable. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6368.959s">Beyond</a>  that, there is nothing in the city charter, the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, federal law that empowers this council to order the mayor to not do what she did. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6378.992s">The</a>  union has filed a suit, as is their right, on behalf of their members, disputing what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6386.218s">Individuals</a>  filed the suit. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6387.339s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6387.679s">Then</a>  the individuals filed the suit themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6389.501s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6389.841s">And</a>  the representative presented it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6391.822s">I</a>  assumed that Teamsters Local 25 represented, but the members have filed suit. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6396.026s">That's</a>  their right. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6397.146s">Beyond</a>  that, their recourse is we can hear facts here. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6399.889s">We</a>  can hear statements made here. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6401.63s">People</a>  can speak at the podium and the Councilors can look for additional information, but that's why we're having the discussion that we're having. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6410.277s">And</a>  no one behind the rail is obligated at this point to say, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6413.672s">their</a>  opinion, whether they feel like they have enough information to make an informed discussion, all I can say is that the experience that was described is not something I would want to experience, and I'm sure we all would like to find out more information about why it happened and to make sure that whatever recourse is available to the people who experienced it is there. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6433.726s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6434.226s">And</a>  one of the reasons that we have rules is so that we maintain decorum and that I can explain the process and what this council has the power to do and not do. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6443.249s">So</a>  I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6445.969s">I'll</a>  go to Zoom and then we'll come back to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6449.07s">On</a>  Zoom, we have Nadeen. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6450.411s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6451.831s">You</a>  have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Moretti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6461.754s">Hi,</a>  can you hear me? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6464.991s">Oh,</a>  hello?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6468.574s">Nadeen,</a>  we can hear you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6469.455s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Moretti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6471.176s">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6471.897s">Thank</a>  you, Nadeen Moretti, Birgit Av. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6473.418s">I</a>  just want to say something brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6476.941s">Of</a>  course, what's going on is just disgusting, and it just seems to always compound with every week, every meeting, every issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6487.83s">What</a>  I do want to point out, though, the level of maturity that is missing <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6493.317s">oftentimes</a>  from the response with people that are behind the podium or that come up to the podium to speak, it's just, it's unthinkable. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6500.484s">I</a>  just can't get over the response sometimes, the laughing, you know, not from every single council member, but I just don't think it's appropriate when you have people that have deep, real feelings what's going on and people are upset and we're constantly upset coming to this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6516.66s">That's</a>  all we ever are. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6519.455s">I</a>  just don't think it's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6520.516s">I</a>  think it's very unbecoming of what a council, I'm not talking about everybody, I'm talking about one person right now, should act. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6526.658s">And</a>  I just think that you really have to dial it down because it's just not appropriate to laugh at people who are coming up with deep-rooted feelings of the stuff that's going on, which is not right by the mayor and most of the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6541.485s">So</a>  I just wanna make a point of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6542.825s">I</a>  think that you really need to, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6545.538s">think</a>  before you laugh or think before you speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6548.721s">You</a>  know, there has to be a level of maturity that is just unfound. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6552.604s">So</a>  thank you for your time.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6556.527s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6557.048s">Um,</a>  we'll go to the podium, name and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6559.65s">Mr.</a>  Castagnetti, you have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6564.154s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6565.415s">Uh,</a>  I, I'm very confused and <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6569.565s">It's</a>  sad to hear this. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6571.086s">It's</a>  a new method happening, I guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6573.749s">I</a>  never heard of this before. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6574.87s">But</a>  I just have one question for, I believe, for a Councilor, and hopefully that Councilor can respond this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6584.418s">Did</a>  I hear a Councilor say that a needle was found in the bathroom in the City Hall premises?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6595.567s">I</a>  believe the representative from Local 25 said that a needle was found, an unused needle was found in the bathroom at the DPW facility.</p>

    <p>[Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6603.271s">I</a>  see. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6605.653s">OK,</a>  could that have been a false flag? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6608.746s">could</a>  have been planted by anyone and could that happen again and do emergency testing all over again in the future if that's the case?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6616.151s">I</a>  do not have information. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6618.032s">I</a>  mean, I don't have that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6619.273s">Um,</a>  all I have is the statement that we received from the mayor, their resolution by the Councilor and what we've heard at the podium.</p>

    <p>[Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6624.736s">Do</a>  you know the location?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6627.078s">I</a>  was, I've heard from the representative that it was at, uh, the DPW bathroom.</p>

    <p>[Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6633.322s">Where's</a>  that located?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6634.543s">At</a>  James street.</p>

    <p>[Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6635.543s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6636.144s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6641.431s">Name</a>  and address for the record please. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6642.372s">You</a>  have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Spinney-Flagg]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6643.292s">Lori</a>  55 Garfield Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6645.874s">I</a>  just want to make a point. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6648.115s">I</a>  didn't even know this had happened and I think it's disgusting for a star but more disgusting was just three months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6658.322s">We</a>  as the residents on Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6661.843s">were</a>  picketing and fighting a methadone dispensary being put on Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6669.735s">And</a>  the mayor now finds that she has the authority to go after employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6676.823s">because</a>  a needle was found? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6678.644s">Does</a>  she even start to think of how many needles would be lining Salem Street if that dispensary had been approved there, which I understand is still on the table somewhere along the authority's ruling to put somewhere else in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6697.829s">Just</a>  wanted to point that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6699.47s">It's</a>  kind of, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6701.892s">You</a>  can put a dispensary in, but now you're going after your employees because a needle was found? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6709.82s">I</a>  don't understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6711.281s">Dispensaries</a>  are okay, needles are okay there, but. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6715.353s">I</a>  mean, I don't think needles anywhere in the city are good, but it's kind of funny that the mayor would go and go after her employees for a needle that they don't even know where it came from. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6727.939s">It</a>  was said earlier, it's not just DPW, it's a public bathroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6733.461s">I</a>  mean, just doesn't make a lot of sense, the management of this city these days. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6738.944s">And</a>  if you guys don't understand, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6741.923s">that</a>  the residents are not happy with what you're putting forward these days. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6748.327s">And</a>  maybe you should start listening to some of the residents because two years is coming soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6756.672s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6759.393s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6759.854s">Any</a>  further comment by members of the public? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6765.877s">Name</a>  and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6766.818s">You</a>  have three minutes, Nate, and I'll wait till you get to the phone.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6802.719s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Martin. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6803.38s">In</a>  terms of the specifics, I mean, it sounds like this is going to be litigated and evidence will be presented on that litigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6811.746s">Any</a>  further public comments? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6815.489s">Seeing</a>  none, I will go to Councilor Callahan and then Councilor Scarpelli and then Councilor Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6821.153s">Councilor</a>  Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6825.176s">Oops,</a>  sorry.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6828.433s">comment</a>  was actually from earlier just to explain. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6831.915s">To</a>  the person who's asking us to respond that like actually, I think I at least for one Councilor was really hoping to hear from the public first. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6839.539s">I</a>  did not want to interrupt and put in my own comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6842.441s">I</a>  really wanted to hear a little bit more about what people had gone through and experienced. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6846.703s">That</a>  was why I was not responding to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6849.264s">I</a>  also do hope that we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6853.386s">Are</a>  we going to sever before we discuss each one or are we going to sever at the very last second? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6858.968s">I</a>  think it might be easier to sever and then discuss each piece.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6862.089s">I'm</a>  just going to take the discussion that's on the table and then we can take any motions. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6872.113s">Go</a>  to Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6874.434s">If</a>  I can, Mr. President, I think that if I can have the representative from local 25 <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6882.133s">And</a>  I think that part of this process, I think that there was a clear trend in meaning behind my resolutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6891.92s">And</a>  I know it was something that's horrible and it's something that would be vetted out properly in the courts. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6900.825s">But</a>  I think that what was clear is making sure that our community understood a few things. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6908.365s">is</a>  one, we get a report that breaks down the funding mechanism and how money's being spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6914.989s">That's</a>  the first thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6916.71s">The</a>  second thing is that understanding the process that our leadership in this community in the mayor's office is lacking and it's causing a huge divide in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6927.335s">I</a>  mean, we've talked about the police today, 900 days without a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6931.618s">We're</a>  talking about the firefighters having some serious issues right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6936.184s">Um,</a>  and then right. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6937.864s">And</a>  what we're talking about right now is what I need to know is how much just this one is an issue cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6945.166s">And</a>  then you brought up a good point, Mr. Hatch. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6946.887s">You</a>  said that, you know, how many communities do you work with? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6950.228s">If</a>  you can, can you, what, what are they? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6952.468s">If</a>  you can, do you know what, what communities...</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6978.452s">Okay,</a>  I think that the question I need to ask you, you've obviously represented those communities and you've had leaders in those communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6988.703s">Is</a>  it an anomaly? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6990.324s">Is</a>  this a trend that we're seeing just because we're in Medford, we're isolated? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6993.707s">I</a>  know by working in a municipality for the last 18 years, I see the difference, but most people don't understand that some people actually come to the city of Medford say, this is the norm. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7005.438s">This</a>  is what a mayor is supposed to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7007.475s">can</a>  you just shed just a little light on your experience and your other communities? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7013.88s">Do</a>  you see the same trends and do you see the same financial impact to their communities that we're seeing here in Medford?</p>

    <p>[Campbell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7019.804s">Well,</a>  I can tell you that me specifically, I worked for over 23 years in a municipality, in several, Concord and more recently for a while in Cambridge, one of the biggest cities in the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7035.951s">And</a>  now I represent all of these cities here with Local 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7040.773s">And</a>  I can honestly tell you Medford is hands down the worst city to work with. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7047.816s">I</a>  can call any other community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7049.557s">I</a>  can call a city manager, a mayor, a town manager, no matter what, and ask a question, get an answer, work together, get our contracts done in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7061.707s">For</a>  somebody to violate somebody's constitutional rights, we've never seen it in Local 25, that any of us have been here. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7068.91s">Some</a>  of us have been here over 25 years, fighting for these cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7072.892s">It</a>  has absolutely never happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7074.353s">Our</a>  attorneys are in awe that this just happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7078.135s">We</a>  don't see it anywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7080.136s">It's</a>  wasteful spending, and it's like nobody has control here.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7083.897s">OK,</a>  so that's my final question is this, because this is what the point is. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7088.168s">The</a>  amount of money we spent on drug testing and breathalyzers for these employees is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7094.15s">I</a>  wanna see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7096.191s">But</a>  I would love to see the cost that to the Teamsters, because we're not getting the true indication of what the city is paying for our attorneys, because we don't have a city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7105.635s">So</a>  I would like, if you can, if you could report back to the council and just give us an idea of what the Teamsters pay, their council, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7114.924s">and</a>  fighting method issues, because that will at least give us a true indication that in the last five and a half years, we've seen that the teams have paid X amount of dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7126.333s">And</a>  from what I gather, it should be pretty equivalent to see where our money is going. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7131.296s">Again,</a>  I'm bringing this forward to the community so we can understand a major impact to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7137.281s">And</a>  I bring up the override every time because we talk about mismanagement of funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7142.569s">And</a>  when we have the representatives of 14 other communities, and we hear that this doesn't happen anywhere else, that's a red flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7151.476s">So</a>  again, I know what was happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7153.798s">We</a>  don't like it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7155.6s">We</a>  stand against it 1,000% as human beings. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7158.762s">But</a>  truly, the intent for this resolution is really to understand, A, the financial impact that we're seeing in all of my other resolutions I put in place, and then B, again, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7171.696s">the</a>  lack of true transparency and true leadership with the mayor of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7177.638s">So</a>  again, I thank you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7179.579s">Again,</a>  I apologize that things are getting heated again, but I know it's something that's very emotional. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7186.262s">I</a>  talked to at least 10 DPW workers that call me directly that I've grown up with, I've been friends with, that were absolutely appalled and embarrassed. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7194.585s">Their</a>  wives called me and said, this is a disgrace. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7197.647s">What</a>  my husband had to endure today was a disgrace. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7201.776s">And</a>  I can't speak to that more than I can, or I wish I could because I would have called the city solicitor and asked him how far I can go with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7210.04s">But</a>  I know that you have put forth the civil rights lawsuit, I believe against the mayor and against the city, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7217.604s">So</a>  that's going to be interesting to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7219.585s">And</a>  again, another financial impact to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7223.727s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Campbell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7231.609s">plus,</a>  just to our members, aside from other unions. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7234.711s">But</a>  we'll be more than happy to get you that information.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7236.752s">That'll</a>  be interesting, because I know that this administration, what they love to do is they like to come back and say, oh, in Everett, they pay this much, and in Malden, they pay this much. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7246.276s">What</a>  I'd like to see is what you pay out to fight issues legally with Everett, with Melrose, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7255.699s">Chelsea</a>  with Cambridge, just to get a true indication how poorly mismanaged this community is when it comes to fiscal transparency.</p>

    <p>[Campbell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7263.001s">Just</a>  a quick side note on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7264.441s">A</a>  lot of those cities, so you know, have city solicitors on the payroll. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7268.442s">The</a>  city of Medford doesn't, so he works by hour, but he's more controllable than a city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7276.004s">So</a>  we'll get you all that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7278.545s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7279.005s">I</a>  would just note that we have received <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7283.001s">dozens</a>  of warrant articles, multiple reports about the legal costs paid out by the city, from the city administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7289.225s">It's</a>  public documents. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7291.506s">We</a>  can provide them. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7292.447s">They're</a>  sent to us by email on a monthly basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7294.588s">The</a>  administration can provide them. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7297.13s">And</a>  the city has never spent more than the budgeted amount for the law department, budgeted in our fiscal year budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7306.616s">there</a>  has been no additional spending or major financial impact on the city beyond the legal budget that is budgeted every year through the fiscal year budget process and that is proven out by the financial documents.</p>

    <p>[Campbell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7316.739s">I</a>  think all of our legal payouts should be accounted for. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7319.54s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7319.94s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7320.5s">All</a>  the settlements. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7321.08s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7322.701s">I'm</a>  speaking right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7323.581s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7328.86s">Any</a>  further comments from members of council? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7330.221s">I'm</a>  going to go to Councilor Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7333.082s">I'm</a>  going to go to Councilor Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7334.723s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7335.484s">Councilor</a>  Leming.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7338.585s">Yes,</a>  thank you, Council President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7340.887s">So</a>  I didn't do this earlier because I wanted to hear what the folks from the DBW in the room had to say during public comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7351.953s">And</a>  it is a point that I have a lot of sympathy with considering that I work a job where I get <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7358.426s">uh,</a>  urinalysis testing in front of my colleagues at least three times a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7362.668s">So,</a>  um, but there are, there are, uh, other issues with this resolution that I have mainly OML considerations, which has been discussed in this council before. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7374.173s">And</a>  I want more information about the private investigator issue, uh, as well as, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7382.998s">the</a>  fact that I'm not sure about the city council stepping into strictly school committee issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7388.843s">So</a>  I'm going to go and invoke rule 21 on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7390.845s">We</a>  can move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7392.266s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7428.675s">It's</a>  talking about when we talk about when you're voting on funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7433.557s">This</a>  isn't a financial paper voting on funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7436.538s">This</a>  is a resolution asking for financial documents that are spent by the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7441.5s">We're</a>  not asking for spending money. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7443.101s">That's</a>  a negative way to get out of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7446.982s">And</a>  I tell you, I'm embarrassed that that just happened.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7595.929s">On</a>  a motion to question the ruling of the chair by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by, seconded by Councilor Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7604.536s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7604.716s">Clerk,</a>  please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7613.603s">I'm</a>  not sure what the motion is. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7614.724s">It's</a>  just a... <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7622.473s">I</a>  have said that I believe that there are financial elements to this paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7634.46s">My</a>  ruling that there are finance elements to the paper that rule 21 would apply here. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7639.383s">Vice</a>  President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7643.407s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7644.988s">I</a>  would note that it wouldn't be my preference to rule 21 this resolution, but I do think that we should separate it out into at least four resolutions and then proceed from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7656.215s">The</a>  first four lines as one resolution, and then the next four paragraphs as one resolution each, and we should, that would be my preference to go from there.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7668.345s">Sounds</a>  like there's two options in front of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7670.885s">One</a>  is I have ruled that there are financial elements to this paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7675.086s">Um,</a>  we could move forward with questioning that, that any of this counts as a finance paper, um, or we could consider the motion to sever prior to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7685.388s">Uh,</a>  that's up to, um, councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7690.769s">Councilor</a>  Callahan did indicate their decision wanting a motion to sever. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7696.95s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7698.821s">um</a>  then uh there's but it was after the second there was already a motion to question the ruling of the chair the motion to sever was was that we would do it after discussion you didn't make a motion to sever you said it was a recommended course of action there was no second there's a second emotion to overrule the ruling of the chair that there are financial elements in this paper that qualify under rule 21 <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7728.962s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7730.022s">If</a>  they want to reach out to me now, I would be happy to hear their interpretation.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7737.067s">My</a>  mic is on. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7738.027s">Does</a>  that mean I am allowed to speak?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7741.25s">Is</a>  there further discussion on the motion of question really in the chair?</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7745.172s">I</a>  would just say that I, I think rule 21 is <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7749.25s">very</a>  unhealthy for us to use. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7752.132s">I</a>  think that we should use it incredibly sparingly. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7755.634s">I</a>  believe that a financial paper is in fact one that moves funding, and we are not doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7760.137s">This</a>  does not actually move any funding anywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7763.319s">So</a>  to me, classifying this as a finance paper with regards to Rule 21 really makes Rule 21 far more broad than I am comfortable with. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7774.405s">I</a>  did not think that was what, like, I don't read rule 21 as saying that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7779.888s">So,</a>  you know, I think a ton of people have come here to hear our thoughts on this and to hear us make, you know, either move this forward or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7787.793s">And</a>  I think it is, it's not really the best, I think, for anyone if we do not allow this discussion to have a conclusion tonight.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7797.918s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7798.458s">And</a>  I would just note that I am actually operating under <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7802.332s">legal</a>  opinions that I received that rule 21 stems from the charter right. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7806.173s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli invoked the charter right in June, and I had to go to legal counsel to discuss that charter right, and legal counsel informed me that the charter right under this rule applies to any motion, order, or resolution under consideration by the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7821.277s">So</a>  it's kind of a catch-22 situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7823.798s">I</a>  don't like it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7824.578s">It's</a>  one of the reasons I think we need to have a charter change. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7828.504s">And</a>  I believe I misinterpreted it last time by being too restrictive. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7831.705s">And</a>  that's why I'm not being restrictive now, based on advice of counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7837.647s">So,</a>  we are where we are because this has been invoked multiple times by multiple Councilors, and given the council opinion that I received in July. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7847.512s">I</a>  believe that under mass general law is the charter that's been adopted by the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7851.394s">The</a>  interpretation that I received from the city's legal counsel was that literally any paper could be postponed by any Councilor until the next meeting for any reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7858.019s">So,</a>  um, huh? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7864.002s">Yeah,</a>  it wasn't from the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7864.963s">It</a>  was from the council at KP law. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7868.825s">So,</a>  um, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7871.786s">We</a>  could take a motion on the ruling of the chair, but again, that's the council advice that advice I received from council. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7876.75s">I've</a>  been on both sides of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7877.851s">I</a>  was too restrictive last time when I ruled something one way, and now I'm trying to go the other way because of the advice I received.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7886.597s">It</a>  seems like it's kind of a no-win scenario for the chair.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7895.184s">He</a>  said that he wanted more information. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7896.685s">He</a>  wanted more time to receive more information. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7898.286s">I</a>  don't know if he can speak to it, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7901.545s">If</a>  we want to go on the motion overall, the ruling of the chair by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Callahan, that's the motion that's on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7908.13s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli has not withdrawn, so I will take the vote on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7916.917s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7918.218s">Councilor</a>  Callahan? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7919.098s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7920.039s">Vice</a>  President Collins? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7920.819s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7923.001s">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7923.622s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7925.663s">Councilor</a>  Leming?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7932.775s">I</a>  can't vote to overrule my own ruling, can I? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7940.121s">I'm</a>  going to vote yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7945.705s">Actually,</a>  that's a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7947.206s">I</a>  will vote present. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7948.107s">3-3,</a>  the motion fails. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7949.988s">So</a>  we'll go to the next motion, which is the motion to sever. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7960.339s">Is</a>  there a motion, there's a motion to sever, Councilor Callahan, do you want to go further into that?</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7964.88s">It's</a>  her motion to sever. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7965.96s">Can</a>  you please repeat exactly how you want to sever it?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7974.321s">Vice</a>  President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7976.102s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7977.242s">My</a>  proposal would be to sever into four resolutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7984.483s">The</a>  first one comprising the first four lines, the second one being the second paragraph, or sorry, the fifth line. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7991.718s">The</a>  third one being the second to last paragraph and the fourth one being the last paragraph.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7997.722s">So</a>  they're divided by topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7999.584s">The</a>  motions would be the first vote would be on requesting those from the school department, the following information, the cost associated with terminating the school superintendent's contract, course communications, correspondence, meeting minutes, records, and reports regarding the separation and the anticipated costs of the search committee and interim appointment.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8016.956s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8018.103s">All</a>  right, the second is the finance director appear before the council to articulate a plan to restore the bond rating that was amended, I believe by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8028.253s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8029.093s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8040.355s">The</a>  third one is regarding private investigators and resolve that the administration report back to the council that identified line in the budget where we are paying private investigators and a complete financial report from the start of this practice to the present. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8053.881s">And</a>  then the fourth is the administrative reporting to the council on the cost of questionable drug testing and a report outlining the reasons for these tests. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8062.724s">I'm</a>  being further resolve the council move to executive session if the issues are confidential. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8068.507s">Does</a>  that sound right, Councilor Collins?</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8070.009s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8070.389s">Is</a>  there a second on the motion to sever? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8071.691s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8073.573s">On</a>  the motion to sever by Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8076.556s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8076.617s">Clerk,</a>  please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8080.421s">Before</a>  we call the roll, Councilor Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8086.642s">The</a>  reason I had split it into five was because the first and third sentences, their cost associated with terminating school superintendent's contract and anticipated costs of superintendent search committee and interim appointment, those to me seem to go together. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8101.951s">Asking</a>  for any and all communications, corresponding meeting minutes, I may have a very different opinion of that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8108.054s">So</a>  I would start. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8110.435s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8259.035s">No,</a>  I said that what has been presented to the council and the legal fees paid to outside lawyers hasn't been paid out of the law budget and has not exceeded the law budget in any prior fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8270.746s">based</a>  on the reports given to us by the administration.</p>

    <p>[Jones]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8272.587s">All</a>  right, so the law budget, as I understand it, is for the law department, which has solicitor, city solicitor, and an assistant.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8280.313s">It</a>  also includes ordinary expenses for settlements. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8283.816s">How</a>  much is that? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8285.056s">I</a>  think it's $100,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8286.598s">Very</a>  small, $100,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8288.099s">It's</a>  a quarter to a fifth of the law department budget.</p>

    <p>[Jones]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8292.082s">OK,</a>  so we're talking about $100,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8293.282s">I</a>  have documented $880,000 of KP law expenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8299.898s">There</a>  is $500,000 in lawful termination suits. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8303.259s">There</a>  are many millions of dollars that are being spent on legal fees. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8308.42s">I</a>  don't think anybody knows where they're coming from, because they're not coming from the law department. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8312.621s">I,</a>  as well as many of you city councils, have been to many a budget hearing, and I have never discussed claims paid, line item, of a million dollars plus in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8323.783s">So</a>  I would love to know where they're coming from, because it can't be coming out of $100,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8326.284s">It's</a>  not coming out of the law department. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8328.973s">This</a>  is not enough money there. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8330.596s">I</a>  don't think anybody knows. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8331.918s">And</a>  I'd like to get a clear answer on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8333.962s">From</a>  the discussion Scarpelli's motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8337.915s">It's</a>  not coming out of the law department, I'll tell you right now.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8340.295s">From</a>  the discussions we've had and several of them in public session, there are claims paid by insurance that are paid by the city's insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8354.078s">Which</a>  type of insurance? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8356.739s">I</a>  would have to look into the specific insurance policies that they're paid out under.</p>

    <p>[Jones]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8361.18s">I've</a>  looked at the budget many times. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8363.78s">I</a>  have a degree in accounting. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8364.84s">I've</a>  been the treasurer for 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8366.501s">I</a>  can't figure it out.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8367.728s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jones]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8368.168s">So,</a>  I must not be the only one. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8369.329s">I</a>  don't think anybody knows. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8371.17s">So,</a>  I'd love to get an answer.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8372.871s">We</a>  have been presented the warrant.</p>

    <p>[Jones]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8373.991s">Where</a>  are these are coming from? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8375.472s">Can</a>  I see the warrants? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8377.013s">What</a>  line item are they coming out of?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8378.473s">You</a>  can absolutely see the warrant articles. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8379.734s">What</a>  I'm telling you is that inside the warrant articles, there have not been settlements paid in those amounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8383.916s">So,</a>  they're not coming from the city's general fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8385.397s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8385.497s">So,</a>  where are they coming from? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8386.357s">We</a>  have been advised by the administration that there have been settlements paid by the city's insurance.</p>

    <p>[Jones]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8390.819s">says</a>  insurance.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8391.58s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8392.16s">So</a>  we have a policy with an insurance company that's paying these out. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8394.923s">There</a>  are several policies that the city has with insurance companies on a number of issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8398.826s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jones]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8399.447s">What,</a>  then what line item does that come out of to pay for those?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8402.69s">The</a>  premiums for the insurance are paid and there's an insurance section in the city budget.</p>

    <p>[Jones]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8407.154s">There's</a>  a group insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8408.815s">That's</a>  part of the city budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8410.297s">I'm</a>  not sure of any other insurance type of, there are, I, we could, I could talk to you about it after the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8415.581s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8416.082s">I'd</a>  love to know because it seems like, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8418.274s">Nobody</a>  knows where this money's coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8419.456s">If</a>  it's an insurance company, then I don't know how we're still getting covered by this insurance company and what type of policy that we're paying into. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8427.387s">I</a>  thought we were self-insured in that regard. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8430.672s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Jones. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8431.573s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8431.893s">Appreciate</a>  the answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8433.295s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8437.611s">Councilor</a>  Villes isn't wrong that the line item for the legal department is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8442.715s">But</a>  the warrant articles that we have, I'll give you an example. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8445.638s">I</a>  have them all right here because I have them ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8448.82s">And</a>  from month to month, I could break it down with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8452.063s">I'm</a>  coming with you tomorrow, Mr. Jones, and I'll show you, I'll give you an example right off the bat, which was alarming. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8457.187s">In</a>  June of 2023, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8460.808s">the</a>  city of method paid KP law through the warrant articles, not in the law, not in the law item in different, different departments over $230,000 just for that one month. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8471.317s">So</a>  I will come and I'll share this information with you just to see council bears isn't wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8476.481s">The</a>  line item for the legal department isn't, they take exactly what they're supposed to. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8480.084s">It's</a>  correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8481.081s">But</a>  the Warren articles that we get month to month, you could see the breakdown. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8485.305s">You</a>  could see the expenditures to KP law for different departments for hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>

    <p>[Jones]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8492.111s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8492.571s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8493.151s">I</a>  understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8493.832s">But</a>  what line item in the departments are they coming from? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8497.895s">I'll</a>  bring it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8498.416s">I'll</a>  bring it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8498.876s">You</a>  can break it down yourself.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8501.837s">It's</a>  not meant to be a back and forth.</p>

    <p>[Jones]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8506.039s">I</a>  think it should because we're talking about millions of dollars that nobody knows where they're going.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8509.761s">We</a>  do literally audited in the city ward articles. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8512.863s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8513.623s">We</a>  do. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8514.223s">It's</a>  not accurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8522.427s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8522.728s">Is</a>  there any further discussion on the item regarding the school superintendent?</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8529.845s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8532.967s">I</a>  understand that the, the resolution at hand is not. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8539.654s">meant</a>  particularly in ill will. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8543.197s">Having</a>  been on a superintendent search committee before, I just worry that this past City Council saying this, passing this, hinders the ability of that body to perform its duties with confidence. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8558.268s">I</a>  understand that it's, in my view, this is <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8564.192s">testing</a>  the waters with separation of powers. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8567.253s">And</a>  so that's why I plan to vote no on this.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8573.676s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Senna. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8577.198s">And</a>  I just did pull up the Mass General Law, Chapter 43, Section 22. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8582.703s">which</a>  was invoked by Councilor Scarpelli in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8587.889s">I</a>  did seek legal counsel advice after my interpretation of that rule, and I would just say again, legal counsel essentially informed me that any member can postpone any resolution, motion, or order for any reason if they want to. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8603.167s">It's</a>  chapter 43, section 22. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8605.828s">He</a>  said rule 21. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8609.629s">He</a>  didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8610.109s">He</a>  didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8610.65s">He</a>  didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8611.21s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8612.03s">But</a>  he said rule 21. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8613.211s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8613.811s">And</a>  I'm glad you figured out what you made a mistake by when I invoked rule 21.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8622.094s">I</a>  sought further opinion.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8623.074s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8624.154s">I</a>  appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8627.247s">I</a>  will say some other lawyers disagree with the interpretation of council, but I will go with the interpretation of the city's legal council, even if I don't agree with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8644.361s">Any</a>  further discussion on the motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8647.264s">Is</a>  there a motion to approve? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8649.426s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Collins to approve <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8656.186s">Paper</a>  24-518A regarding the school superintendent's contract, seconded by? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8664.731s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Gallagher. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8665.951s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8670.534s">This</a>  is now the be it resolved that the school department respond, report back to the council the information of the cost associated with terminating the school superintendent's contract and the anticipated costs of the superintendent search committee and interim appointment.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8785.535s">Yes,</a>  60 affirmative, one of the negative, the motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8790.192s">24-518-C</a>  which is be it resolved that the city administration cease and desist the use of private investigators to follow and harass employees utilizing contractually afforded leave benefits be it further resolved the city administration report back to the council with the identified line in the budget where we are paying private investigators in a complete financial report from the start of this practice to the present. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8809.94s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8815.622s">Councilor</a>  Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8820.785s">I</a>  would be in favor of something that was not exactly this, but that requested from the administration to understand what is our policy? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8830.471s">What</a>  is the reason which we are doing this? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8832.212s">I</a>  mean, for me, both of these last two paragraphs are, I will say, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8839.184s">I</a>  hope we have a really good reason if we are doing either of these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8844.867s">I</a>  looked a little bit into different state laws, in different states, different state laws on drug testing, for example. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8856.632s">And</a>  it has to be only under certain circumstances. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8863.436s">So</a>  I think for me, I really want to have an explanation of what our policy is as a city for both of these. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8874.289s">And</a>  if we are doing either of these, what the reasoning is behind it, I don't think that I am completely ready to vote yes on this before I have more information, a flat-out cease and desist, although it does, like, I mean, hearing the language, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8896.714s">may</a>  seem attractive, but before I have more information, I'm not willing to vote yes on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8900.918s">I</a>  would vote yes if this were amended to say we want to know a full policy, we want to understand, you know, when this is used, and then the cost as well.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8913.484s">If</a>  that would help to get the information that we're looking for, I would be amenable to changing the language so we can get some information through the administration to see if these are the practices and if they are where we stand as a council. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8929.518s">So</a>  I would be willing to make those amendments.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8932.881s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8933.622s">Councilor</a>  Callahan, could you articulate those amendments?</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8936.186s">let</a>  me do my best to request that the city administration provide its policy regarding the use of private investigators with regards to any city all any or all its city employees and then I'm okay with the second sentence be it further resolved that the city administration report back with the identified line items in the budget</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8985.023s">Any</a>  further discussion on the item? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8987.344s">Councilor</a>  Tseng?</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8989.406s">I</a>  agree with Councilor Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8992.407s">I</a>  wanted to chime in and request that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8994.649s">I</a>  wasn't comfortable, and I am not, I'm not comfortable with <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8999.318s">with</a>  language that I think is overstepped that line, the separation of powers line. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9006.1s">And</a>  this is the way that it was worded in the first place, I think, overstepped that line. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9013.143s">I</a>  appreciate your suggested amendments. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9017.116s">And</a>  I agree with what you said about, we should have a very good reason for why we're doing things like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9023.558s">We</a>  should, but it's not our role as a council to step in and say what we can or can't do and compel a mayor to do something that's within her charter right to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9039.262s">We'll</a>  talk about charter review next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9041.822s">But</a>  I think we need to follow the letter of the law, and I'm much more comfortable with the amendment.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9050.709s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Callahan, if you have more comments, Councilor Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9054.175s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9054.955s">If</a>  I may, I have to say, I am overall, whenever I have looked into specific questions, things like how much free cash we get at the end of the budget year, and whether that is something that is viewed by the state of Massachusetts, by bond agencies, et cetera, as is that something positive or negative? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9080.942s">There</a>  are other things that I have looked into that the city has done that have been questions about what the city is doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9086.725s">And</a>  when I've looked into very specific things like those, I am usually, I find that what, or for example, the other one is like creating capital stabilization funds, these sorts of things, I have found that <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9105.928s">the</a>  city administration is actually doing things that are considered, in those two cases, considered best practice by the state of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9116.018s">And</a>  that being said, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9123.135s">I,</a>  if, if we were a city council where I genuinely believed that the mayor or the administration were doing something that I disagreed with, even if it were the purview of the mayor, I, as a city Councilor, I would feel comfortable making a motion that says the city council does not agree with X, Y, Z practice if that were the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9146.014s">Um,</a>  so I just want to make it clear that I don't think that we as a city council are <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9151.918s">in</a>  any way trapped against saying what we believe our opinion of what the administration should be doing is. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9158.602s">I</a>  think that we can say the same thing to Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9160.423s">We</a>  can't control Tufts, but we sure can say we wish Tufts were doing something different. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9164.606s">We</a>  would like Tufts to do something different. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9166.047s">I</a>  think we can say that to the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9169.769s">So</a>  a slight disagreement, I think, with my fellow Councilor, or maybe not, but if I was understanding you correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9177.293s">I</a>  just think I don't have the information, and I really want to have a lot more information before I make any kind of decision on something that would say something so strongly worded as that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9192.616s">But</a>  I'm happy that I think we're going to get a wording change, and we'll be able to get a little more information.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9197.917s">Just</a>  to quickly clarify, that's not completely correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9201.098s">I</a>  meant a compulsion order. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9202.358s">I</a>  think that's over the line.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9206.761s">Yeah,</a>  I don't think we have the authority to require the cease and desist.</p>

    <p>[Rafferty]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9210.945s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9219.773s">Sorry,</a>  can you just repeat what the amended for me, what the amended motion was?</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9227.199s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, whatever you have. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9230.1s">What</a>  I have is a request that the administration provide a policy regarding use of private investigators with regard to any and all city employees and have the administration report back with the identified line item in the budget from which that expenditure is made.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9328.42s">I</a>  actually, to be honest, I would like to know what our drug policy testing is for all city employees.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9336.806s">and</a>  report back what our drug policies are for all city employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9340.467s">It's</a>  a good idea.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9370.741s">I</a>  do think that the reasons for these particular tests, I would be interested in that as well.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9378.934s">I'll</a>  be honest. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9379.855s">I</a>  do not believe that we will ever receive that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9383.34s">And</a>  I personally do not feel comfortable asking for it.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9386.021s">I</a>  honestly I think that we might because of the reading that I did on drug testing in different states in the United States. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9395.806s">There</a>  are certain, there are only certain times that it can be done, it is not at the whim of the mayor or anyone else in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9403.809s">there,</a>  you know, it falls into certain categories where it is legal and then other categories where it is not legal. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9409.714s">So</a>  I imagine that we will, we will get an answer that at least will fall into like some vague category. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9415.418s">And</a>  I would be happy with that.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9416.679s">What</a>  are Councilors saying?</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9417.459s">Then</a>  Councilor Scarpelli from my reading, from my legal reading and research into this, there are splits between different federal courts, state courts, circuit splits on this particular issue for when it comes to public employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9430.828s">There</a>  are public and private factors to weigh. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9434.533s">That's</a>  all to say it's actually very not clear-cut. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9437.577s">There</a>  are restrictions on the government's ability to do this, of course, but it's not very clear-cut.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9447.27s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9448.291s">I</a>  think the union representative was very clear in the process and the policies when to be drug tested. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9454.314s">So,</a>  um, regardless what the federal laws are, but there are agreements and laws that were made, uh, in, in negotiation to make sure that these weren't violated. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9465.58s">So</a>  I think that the mayor has that, uh, to be honest with you, that would be very clear and understandable for everybody here. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9472.883s">Cause</a>  she definitely violated that.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9475.205s">I</a>  would just note that regardless of any of that, this is very clearly the subject of litigation and the city will reply that because it's the subject of litigation, they're not going to be providing any information that could be detrimental to their case. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9488.191s">So</a>  if we could stick to things <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9491.758s">Yeah,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9492.958s">So</a>  we're going to stick to the drug policy and the cost associated with drug testing employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9501.742s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9503.202s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, as amended by Councilor Callahan, I seconded by. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9511.325s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9512.626s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9601.856s">I</a>  wanna have some clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9604.758s">Um</a>  the requested meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9607.28s">So,</a>  I'm assuming this is a meeting between the administration and the fire department that you're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9614.326s">Like,</a>  can you be a little bit more clear?</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9616.007s">Council</a>  asked for when we had the the chief chief Evans here when we talked about the <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9627.145s">And</a>  the report then was presented to the deputies and the chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9631.849s">And</a>  we were waiting on a meeting to inform the council of what their findings were with that meeting.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9639.115s">So</a>  you're asking that the meeting with the council also include the fire chief and the union leadership.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9647.922s">The</a>  administration.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9649.923s">But</a>  that if there needs to be an executive session, we would have that without those folks.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9656.711s">they</a>  would be included in that executive session because you're bringing them in to discuss personal. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9662.193s">They</a>  have to be there for talking about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9663.894s">So</a>  that's the intent of executive session.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9668.236s">I'm</a>  not sure what the executive session exemption would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9670.577s">I</a>  think we're going to have to consult council on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9679.66s">I</a>  believe we move forward with this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9682.664s">Did</a>  we make a motion to request a meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9684.886s">We</a>  did that that evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9686.368s">That</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9686.889s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9688.13s">That</a>  was a motion that we've got nothing back. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9690.753s">And</a>  this is a motion to request a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9692.856s">Request</a>  an update on the meeting requests regarding the MRI report for the fire department.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9698.262s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9701.485s">And</a>  the second piece, Council President, if you want to leave it open-ended, after consulting the legal team, that we then have the ability to go to executive sessions so they see fit, or they deem it approved.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9720.566s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9720.806s">So,</a>  amend to the second session to be that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9722.827s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9723.568s">Uh</a>  the council will, council leadership will speak to the city's legal council to determine if there's a valid executive session. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9732.413s">Option.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9733.313s">Option.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9733.794s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9734.234s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9735.635s">I'll</a>  go to</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9739.866s">I</a>  support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9741.187s">I</a>  think that that would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9743.429s">I</a>  would also say if it would make sense, we could hold it in the public health and community safety committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9749.313s">And</a>  then if we could leave the committee to executive session, I don't know if that's common, but that way we would avoid any open meeting on violations. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9756.179s">I</a>  don't know if that's, if this meeting would be in open, in an open session or not, but the, it seems to me as a community, as a public safety, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9767.688s">organization,</a>  the fire department, we could do it in committee if that makes more sense.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9778.536s">I</a>  think that the process that this council's totality voted to fund this report and having an open forum, having the report presented to the public and then go to executive session through open meeting</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9795.447s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9795.687s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9795.888s">All</a>  of all meetings have to start as open meetings.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9798.091s">So,</a>  but as a committee, a committee, a meeting with all the, all the members of this council, because they think that committee of the whole versus the public health and safety committee, I'd rather, I'd rather that if that was the option.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9811.508s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9811.968s">So</a>  this is a motion to request an update on the requested meeting, uh, to review the MRI report regarding the Medford fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9819.672s">And</a>  the amended resolution is to, uh, request a committee of the whole meeting and to determine on advice of legal counsel, uh, whether or not, uh, the city council can enter executive session to discuss elements of that report.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9834.12s">Perfect.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9834.521s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9835.101s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9838.217s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, as amended by Councilor Lazzaro, as seconded by Councilor Tseng, is there any further discussion by members of the Council? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9845.703s">Seeing</a>  none, we'll go to public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9847.945s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9849.206s">You</a>  have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Jones]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9851.408s">I</a>  say, Mayor Sridhar, I believe the night that we, the Council so graciously appropriated the money for this report, I requested a copy of the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9859.395s">I</a>  have not seen one as of yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9861.156s">Plain</a>  and simple, the union would like a seat at the table to see what the consultant <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9866.3s">decided</a>  when information was discussed and what we need to do to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9872.382s">As</a>  of yet, we have not seen anything from the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9876.284s">Just</a>  asking the union has a seat at the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9878.685s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9879.385s">Uh,</a>  just to clarify, has that not been provided with?</p>

    <p>[Jones]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9889.189s">No,</a>  I have not seen anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9890.909s">I'd</a>  like to be a present at the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9892.51s">Union</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9893.337s">union</a>  leadership.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9894.898s">Yeah,</a>  it'll be a public meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9896.259s">So</a>  you can absolutely be present. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9897.88s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9899.181s">And</a>  the report is public record. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9901.543s">It</a>  was sent to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9902.203s">I'm</a>  happy to forward it to you.</p>

    <p>[Jones]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9903.504s">That</a>  would be great.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9904.545s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9905.626s">I</a>  believe there's any issues with the name tells us have any issues with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9909.769s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9910.149s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9912.31s">Yes,</a>  it's still Yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9916.073s">I</a>  don't think a further amendment is needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9921.706s">Yeah,</a>  no, it's it's public record. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9923.667s">It's</a>  public document. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9930.353s">And</a>  you have you have a copy of that, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9932.014s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9934.036s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9934.616s">Alright.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9936.598s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9938.379s">On</a>  the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9939.0s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9946.306s">I</a>  believe the second was <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9952.341s">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro Bennett and Councilor Tseng is the second. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9954.103s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9960.967s">Councilor</a>  Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9964.409s">Vice</a>  President Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9965.89s">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9967.491s">Councilor</a>  Leming.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9975.116s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9977.179s">7</a>  affirmative, none negative, the motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9981.222s">24490,</a>  this is a continued public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9983.363s">We</a>  open this public hearing on December 3rd, 2024 in our regular meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9987.987s">This</a>  is regarding the Mystic Avenue Corridor District zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9993.03s">I'm</a>  reopening the public hearing now. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9997.543s">We</a>  did receive a report. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9999.744s">This</a>  was reported. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10001.045s">Recommendations</a>  were reported to us from the community development board. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10004.807s">So</a>  we have Mystic Avenue corridor district in front of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10011.891s">And</a>  with that, I will entertain any motions or discussion from the council before we hear from members of the public in the public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10020.557s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10022.592s">that</a>  I know that had a great discussion with our director, that there were some questions with the process of notification in our processes through the city council, whether they were done legally, and they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10043.113s">Unfortunately,</a>  the software that we have <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10045.461s">When</a>  the resolution is opened and moves forward, it's not written out in totality. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10051.045s">So</a>  people didn't see that tonight's would be the final vote for Mystic Ave rezoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10059.672s">We're</a>  informed that the process was done correctly and that if there is a way that we can look in the future to try to share that information to make sure that there aren't any questions moving forward, I think that'll be helpful.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10072.472s">Yeah,</a>  it is in page six of the packet here, public hearing notices, it's amendments to add the Mystic Avenue corridor district. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10080.579s">And</a>  we've now have joint advertising of community development board and zoning city council public hearings. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10087.785s">So</a>  we opened this hearing on December 3rd and it was continued by a vote of the council to today's meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10096.113s">Council</a>  Vice President Collins and then Councilor Kelly.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10100.316s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10100.816s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10102.858s">And</a>  I do appreciate the discussion, the clarity around the noticing. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10105.881s">I</a>  think especially with these zoning ordinances, I think the process is clear, but it's complicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10110.926s">It's</a>  one of those things that is wonky and technical and it has to procedurally, legally, it must kind of go from body to body. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10118.493s">So</a>  I think it's really understandable that, you know, there's for <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10122.984s">folks</a>  who aren't intimately familiar with the zoning referral process. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10126.13s">It's</a>  not intuitive, and that makes a lot of sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10128.915s">And</a>  due to, you know, continued collaboration, especially between members of the planning and permitting committee, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10134.778s">We're</a>  kind of continually trying to make sure that we're messaging these meetings ever better and making it easier for folks to know where we are in the process and I think that this is an easy thing that we can add to kind of the increased levels of communication and flyering that we're doing around our ongoing zoning work just to try and do what we can to make this important, technical, complicated, you know, very interesting process a little more legible for <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10159.04s">just</a>  regular folks in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10161.902s">Having</a>  said that, just if you'll indulge me for just a little bit of retrospective before I make a motion, really excited that Mystic Avenue Corridor District zoning proposal has come back to the City Council tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10174.671s">It's</a>  taken, you know, as with any zoning proposal, it's taken a thorough and storied road to get here. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10182.176s">We</a>  had a mapping workshop back in July. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10184.217s">We</a>  decided that Mystic Avenue Corridor District was going to be one of the first things that we took a deep dive into because, you know, between our housing production plan, between our comprehensive plan, from so many comments that me and my colleagues have received from constituents over the years talking about just, it's so visible, I think for so many people, the untapped potential on Mystic Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10205.665s">I</a>  think that the kind of, there was a very clear vision for how we could do more. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10211.334s">even</a>  more with this really valuable property in Medford and Leverage. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10215.515s">It's</a>  a transit corridor. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10217.235s">There's</a>  some really big lots. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10218.896s">It's</a>  good for a lot of things and we should be doing more with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10221.436s">This</a>  council has been really focused on doing what we can to try and set the stage for more commercial development so that we are building our commercial tax base as much as possible and having that trickle into things like schools and roads and public services. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10236.559s">So</a>  we began our discussions of the Mystic Avenue Corridor District in August. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10240.282s">We</a>  workshopped it for a couple months with city staff, with our zoning consultant in committee, receiving feedback from the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10248.467s">We</a>  looked at a lot of different options. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10250.148s">We</a>  took in feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10251.108s">We</a>  made tweaks after committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10252.909s">It</a>  was referred to the Community Development Board. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10254.71s">It</a>  came back to us tonight with some recommendations to just further tweak it and make it <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10262.859s">more</a>  legible for developers, make more sense, be easier to understand, and just be easier to achieve some of the requirements, incentives that we're really hoping that developers will take us up on on Mystic App, so that we'll both get great development along Mystic App that's in the line of what the community really wants to see there, but is also, you know, simple and clear enough that <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10284.733s">People</a>  can look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10285.614s">Residents</a>  can look at it and developers can look at and say, OK, it's obvious to me what they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10290.381s">It's</a>  obvious to me how to meet these requirements so that we can partner with the city to do more on this to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10300.555s">Having</a>  said that, I think, you know, happy to have more of a discussion on the specific amendments that the CD board is recommending that we adopt tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10309.584s">They</a>  are in our packets. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10311.305s">I</a>  think they're pretty straightforward and intuitive tweaks, but I would motion to approve for first reading the Mystic Avenue Corridor District zoning proposal and adopt the recommended amendments. <a

special permit granting authority on adult uses to the City Council to maintain consistency with the rest of the zoning ordinance.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10420.715s">Just</a>  go to the, that's the hearing notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10422.416s">Go</a>  under the meeting files. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10424.237s">You</a>  see them under the meeting files. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10430.354s">I'll</a>  go to Director Hunt to describe the Community Development Board memorandum. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10442.799s">We</a>  also do have Danielle Evans still with us at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10445.941s">If</a>  you want to go to Danielle.</p>

    <p>[Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10447.942s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10449.482s">Danielle</a>  and I are communicating. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10450.843s">She's</a>  available for questions but said she was happy to have me speak since I was here in the room.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10454.745s">Thanks</a>  for sticking it out.</p>

    <p>[Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10457.554s">Pardon</a>  me if I'm a little punchy. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10459.714s">So</a>  the recommendations of the Community Development Board were pretty straightforward. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10465.016s">We</a>  changed up the table of development incentives for the affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10471.458s">The</a>  way it was written was very confusing and was very hard to interpret. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10476.14s">And</a>  so what we did was turned it into a table format that is a little bit easier to understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10481.762s">It</a>  was actually a recommendation that came from the <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10484.683s">our</a>  consultant. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10486.204s">And</a>  in fact, if you saw the Salem Street zoning in our public meetings, it's the table that you saw in the Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10492.427s">So</a>  we've been kind of leapfrogging each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10495.089s">So</a>  because we figured it out in between, it had to come as a CD board recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10501.952s">The</a>  other changes, I believe, are all things you saw in that <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10505.674s">the</a>  development bonuses that we're removing certified as LEED Gold or equivalent standard for as an incentive because that's almost essentially required by our building code right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10520.426s">And</a>  so we would be giving them a floor for doing something they kind of have to do anyhow. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10524.67s">But</a>  we kept to meet LEED Platinum or equivalent and as one floor, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10534.477s">And</a>  what we are saying is that we change the word certified to certifiable because you don't get certified until a year after the building is open. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10544.0s">And</a>  in fact, we don't literally care if they get the plaque, we care that they meet all the standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10549.461s">So</a>  it's changing that language from certified to certifiable. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10555.929s">Another</a>  thing that had gotten carried over, so these are the same incentives that were in the zoning that we did for the Wellington area MBTA zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10567.817s">And</a>  one of them we weren't allowed to make required in that area was to have 75% of the ground floor as commercial. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10575.382s">So</a>  we were in that neighborhood in Wellington giving an extra floor to incentivize it because it was MBTA zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10583.027s">In</a>  this area, we're actually requiring 75% active first floor throughout. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10589.451s">So</a>  we're not giving it again, we had to, that was essentially a typo, we were not giving a bonus for something that's required. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10597.596s">And</a>  then <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10599.644s">Oh,</a>  yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10600.485s">Dimensional</a>  waivers. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10603.247s">It</a>  came to our attention that there might be opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10605.749s">So</a>  we actually in this zoning have a minimum height as well as a max. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10609.712s">And</a>  so we said with a special permit, the CD board should be able to waive the minimum height requirement because you might have a fantastic project that everybody wants to see, but it's not going to be three stories high. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10623.321s">And</a>  so that in the languages there, that if it's consistent with the purpose of the district and the goals of the Medford Comprehensive Plan, the board could waive the minimum height requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10636.864s">And</a>  those are the recommendations from the board on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10642.606s">And</a>  then, yes, Councilor Collins caught the typos that we had.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10647.587s">It's</a>  in height, not stories.</p>

    <p>[Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10650.068s">There</a>  are height and stories.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10652.432s">So</a>  the recommended is height though, and best practice is height?</p>

    <p>[Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10656.754s">So</a>  we actually are doing a minimum of three stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10661.656s">And</a>  I believe there's a minimum height in there as well.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10664.418s">So</a>  it shows both?</p>

    <p>[Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10669.52s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10671.161s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10672.681s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10673.342s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10673.962s">The</a>  minimum for height is only in stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10677.083s">The</a>  maximums are in height and stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10682.136s">So</a>  how many, sorry, the amount of stories you, sorry, my brain, I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10692.623s">It</a>  is late. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10693.564s">The</a>  height for a ground floor story has a minimum of 14 feet and a maximum of 18 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10699.428s">For</a>  an upper floor story, a minimum of 10 feet and a maximum of 12 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10703.611s">So</a>  there is in fact maximum heights, but it's per story. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10707.853s">It's</a>  not like you could just make one 30-story first floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10712.036s">And</a>  frankly, somebody said to us, but what about the Great American Beer Hall? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10715.499s">It's</a>  amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10716.62s">It's</a>  kind of one story and like kind of like it's got a balcony. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10720.383s">Like,</a>  how would you consider that? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10722.445s">And</a>  I said, we said, well, actually, maybe for the really great projects that have a really great design and make sense, you shouldn't hold them so strictly to some of these items. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10733.467s">But</a>  overall, for design and look and feel, you would want to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10737.848s">So</a>  those were the things. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10739.248s">And</a>  then the typos that we caught with regards to who is the permit granting authority.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10747.151s">And</a>  generally, you're talking about situations where projects would already be undergoing a special permit process or site plan review?</p>

    <p>[Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10754.245s">It</a>  is so we have minimum of 10,000 square feet building goes to site plan review. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10760.37s">So</a>  it is a high expectation that projects along this corridor will end up in site plan review.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10766.295s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10767.476s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli, anything else?</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10770.285s">I</a>  just, I know that we've been, I'm going to be redundant and I know that this is my, my cry from the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10776.968s">Um,</a>  and I know the director has tried and we've, we've talked about this and informing the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10782.71s">I</a>  know we've done, um, you know, what you feel is due diligence, but I'm going to stick with what, what this council prior really wanted to see was really bringing <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10794.028s">these</a>  meetings to the neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10796.55s">When</a>  I did talk to residents of the corridor and business owners, and I know that you've corrected me a few times and said, George, we put it in the water bill, we've gone directly to the businesses, but the members that have reached out to me, the neighbors that I've talked to, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10816.451s">truly</a>  don't understand the process still. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10818.132s">And</a>  I think that there are some restrictions. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10820.053s">I</a>  mean, when you look at our zoning process, we still, we're only Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10824.075s">So</a>  that really hurts. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10826.296s">So</a>  people really can't get involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10828.137s">And</a>  I think, again, I think this is my biggest battle is that <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10835.393s">As</a>  we're moving forward, I really would like to see us go into the neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10838.474s">I</a>  know Innes said they would look to see if it's possible to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10841.736s">I</a>  know that that was part of the RFP that I read that we looked at back in the day when we first started this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10846.818s">So</a>  again, I just think that's important, especially when you're making these changes that we haven't done in 100 years, that residents feel like they've been listened to. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10856.342s">I</a>  know that we've done a lot of listening sessions. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10859.023s">We've</a>  had a lot of meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10860.843s">But</a>  again, I think that that last piece, I feel, is a big void. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10864.878s">I</a>  think that we need to go to the neighborhood, and I'm gonna stand on my soapbox to the end with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10870.121s">So</a>  thank you for listening.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10872.462s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10873.463s">I'm</a>  gonna go back to Councilor Callahan, then to Councilor Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10877.465s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10878.525s">The</a>  one change I would additionally like to make is I am hoping, I know that we have not had a chance yet to discuss co-living, which as far as I understand it is really just people who are not related to each other living, renting an apartment. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10893.753s">And</a>  I feel a little bit uncomfortable with the fact that that is disallowed in certain sections of MSTICAV. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10899.355s">So</a>  I'm hoping that we can just remove that definition and everywhere it appears for this particular approval tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10906.217s">And</a>  that'll give us time to talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10908.878s">And</a>  we can always add that definition later. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10910.439s">I</a>  don't think it's going to delay anything or be problematic to simply remove that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10914.9s">But</a>  I'd love to ask you your opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10916.581s">Do</a>  you think that we could just</p>

    <p>[Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10918.813s">For</a>  this evening, I think it would be simpler to say strike line A8 of the use table, and that way it wouldn't be explicitly allowed, it wouldn't be specifically not allowed, and then we can sort of work out the clear understandings of what that means.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10935.844s">Yeah,</a>  I would also just note, I don't think that <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10939.577s">people</a>  who are unrelated are allowed to live in an apartment regardless of whether co-living as a specific use is allowed or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10944.041s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10945.383s">But</a>  okay, is that a motion to strike line A8? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10947.705s">Yes,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10948.806s">There's</a>  an amendment motion to add to the motion of Councilor Collins to strike line A8 from the use table by Councilor Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10956.713s">Is</a>  there a second? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10958.034s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10960.476s">Is</a>  there any, I guess really, is there any opposition to that amendment? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10964.167s">Seeing</a>  none, that'll be included in Councilor Collins' motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10967.928s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10968.729s">I'll</a>  go to Councilor Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10972.59s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10974.231s">I</a>  want to thank you for your hard work on this, to thank the team at Innes Associates for their hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10981.254s">I</a>  know a lot of us on the City Council have been working really hard, but I do want to give a special shout out to our planning and permitting committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10990.897s">this</a>  is a huge, huge deal for our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10994.359s">Any</a>  zoning change is, but this one is one of many that are coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11000.201s">I</a>  know people in the neighborhood who are very excited about this, and especially with this being one of the corridors into the heart of our city, one of the gateways into our city, to have a more thriving scene there, to have more <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11017.188s">business</a>  in Medford to have more residences in Medford, these are all good things. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11022.971s">When</a>  we consider the environmental impact that this will have, this is a really great thing for the environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11028.174s">When</a>  we make changes like this, and you know, this is a reckoning that a lot of cities have been having, is that we can actually win on housing, we can win on the environment, we can win on business development. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11040.48s">And</a>  I think this is one of those proposals that will move our city in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11043.841s">So</a>  I'm very grateful for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11045.502s">I</a>  think this is something that we should celebrate as a city. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11049.726s">It's</a>  great to be ending the year with something like this, and I very happily support this.</p>

    <p>[Thompson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11293.438s">The</a>  Medford Chamber of Commerce is encouraged by the proposed zoning changes aimed at fostering commercial development and strengthening the Medford business community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11300.74s">These</a>  efforts represent an important step forward, taking Medford a more attractive and accessible place for businesses to grow and thrive. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11307.582s">However,</a>  as plans as the Mystic Ave corridor district move forward, it is essential to ensure that existing locally owned small businesses in the area are supported and included in the discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11317.285s">The</a>  current restrictions and in some cases outright prohibitions on parking facilities pose significant challenges for these businesses, many of which are already struggling to meet customer parking demands, specifically in the mixed use three zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11329.674s">We</a>  strongly recommend that non residential parking garages and additional parking areas be permitted to better accommodate businesses neighbors and their customers. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11337.799s">Furthermore,</a>  the Mystic Avenue corridor district's proximity to I-93 offers a unique opportunity to attract and serve drivers seeking convenient access to local food and business establishments. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11348.668s">Unfortunately,</a>  the current prohibition on drive-thru facilities undermines this potential. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11353.453s">Allowing</a>  drive-thru options would enable businesses to better cater to highway travelers and capitalize on the district's prime location. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11359.915s">Mystic</a>  Avenue already has multiple drive-thru businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11362.777s">We</a>  respectfully request that the drive-thru prohibition be reconsidered or removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11368.862s">Thank</a>  you for consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11370.643s">Laura</a>  O'Neill, Executive Director, Medford Chamber of Commerce.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11435.046s">Yeah,</a>  I'm happy to answer that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11436.107s">We're</a>  going to be considering the community solar program as the discussion and the zoning project continues. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11442.833s">We</a>  need to look into some specifics on it, but the plan is to include it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11448.058s">Right</a>  now, I'm actually taking some information provided to me from some community activists, providing it to the zoning team that's working on this, and then it's likely that that, excuse me, will be included. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11459.051s">as</a>  an incentive piece across all of the districts where there's incentive zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11462.472s">We</a>  just want to get it right. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11465.053s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11469.994s">Any</a>  further comment on this public hearing? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11475.816s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11477.396s">And</a>  you have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11545.209s">Uh</a>  thank you, Paulette. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11545.909s">I</a>  just want to note both of those projects were private projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11548.87s">So,</a>  the private property owner decided who they wanted to work with and then they were the ones who submitted the plans to the city and and the city doesn't have any choice as to who we would get to <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11560.751s">representing</a>  private property owners and they are allowed to. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11563.803s">petition</a>  the city within the zoning ordinance and the Massachusetts general laws for whatever they need to do on their private property. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11570.267s">So,</a>  so we don't have any.</p>

    <p>[Vartabedian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11571.827s">We</a>  don't have, we don't have any right to refuse a company that has a horrible reputation. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11578.151s">We're</a>  going to bring them into our community.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11580.332s">Only</a>  the private property landowner has the right. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11582.553s">They</a>  have their unlimited right to choose who they want to represent them when making petitions to the city regarding permits, licenses, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11590.417s">We</a>  don't have any control over that.</p>

    <p>[Vartabedian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11591.638s">So</a>  the only thing we would do is to, um, if we didn't want a particular party to come to our city is to not license them or, uh, they, any, any party has any right to ask for relief or any of the city's processes.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11607.601s">That's,</a>  that's, um, pretty, pretty foundational, um, under the current way that the state and federal laws work for private property.</p>

    <p>[Vartabedian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11616.323s">I</a>  understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11617.043s">Um,</a>  you don't want to restrict in the prejudicial things and such, but, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11621.414s">I</a>  think we should have some type of say into the reputation of a business that's coming into our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11628.497s">But</a>  that being said, I'm assuming that when these construction starts, whether it's Salem Street or Mystic Ave, that we're going to put out a bid to different companies to bid on the projects.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11640.983s">No,</a>  so that would be if the city owned land and was then trying to build a project in these areas, then we would have to go through this process, the bidding process procurement. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11651.21s">Zoning</a>  affects private property owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11653.111s">I</a>  mean, it affects public property nominally, but most of the property in the city is owned by private entities, individuals, corporations, groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11661.578s">So</a>  when we change the zoning, that changes the laws about what we allow private property owners to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11668.042s">um</a>  private property owners can pick any construction company any lawyer or any designer any architect that they want to make a proposal make a design um and the city just has the process of outlined here like a site plan review process or special permitting process <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11684.721s">where</a>  the city has some limited, in some cases limited, in some cases significant discretionary choice as to what to allow, but we do not control who owns private property and we do not control who private property owners choose to hire to design projects, to construct projects, to make proposals to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11704.911s">So,</a>  and I don't think there's any law that would allow us to change that.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11793.185s">It's</a>  all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11793.926s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11797.068s">It's</a>  chicken, man. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11797.828s">There's</a>  not so much you can do.</p>

    <p>[Merritt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11798.789s">Yeah,</a>  the sauce is pretty good. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11803.932s">So</a>  they put it in my neighborhood, which is fine.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11805.633s">It</a>  is Councilor Lazzaro's birthday, so let's give a little. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11810.036s">And</a>  we have a big crowd, but.</p>

    <p>[Merritt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11811.117s">What,</a>  do you not like the sauce?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11813.558s">I</a>  think she just doesn't want any more comments on the sauce.</p>

    <p>[Merritt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11815.279s">Chair,</a>  do you not like the sauce? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11818.248s">So</a>  that said, it's in my neighborhood, and I don't think my neighborhood is necessarily any less safe or any more safe because of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11825.57s">And</a>  my neighborhood has had a lot of development over the past few years since I've moved in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11830.731s">So</a>  now you have a major corridor on Mystic Ave, and we say, you can't have a drive-through at all? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11837.693s">I</a>  mean, what if Chick-fil-A opened up, which, by the way, is a gold mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11841.134s">And</a>  if you like King's Chicken, Chick-fil-A is awesome. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11844.882s">just</a>  my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11846.022s">And</a>  rightfully so, in Woburn, a lot of other people think so, and they get off the highway, and they go to Chick-fil-A, and they pick up their food, and they leave, and they're very prompt. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11856.285s">And</a>  considering commercial business is part of the lifeblood of this city, I think that restricting, you know, because of this particular issue, right, with drive-thrus, might not be a wise choice given our fiscal situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11872.11s">So</a>  maybe I don't know if that's something that can be amended or not to reconsider that particular part of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11879.112s">You</a>  might wanna reconsider it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11880.532s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11881.232s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11883.473s">Any</a>  further public comment? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11884.673s">I</a>  see one hand on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11885.773s">I</a>  will go to, oh, that hand has gone down. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11889.314s">So</a>  I will, if there's no further public comment in this public hearing, I will declare the public hearing closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11900.672s">Any</a>  comments on the motion by Councilor Collins as amended by Councilor Callahan and seconded by Councilor Tseng to adopt the recommendations of the Community Development Board and to typos and strike line A8 of the use table Councilor Callahan</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11918.615s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11919.215s">I</a>  just wanted to say how much I appreciated the comment about our values. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11922.957s">I</a>  think it's always really important to discuss our values. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11926.699s">And</a>  I agree that in the comprehensive plan, it really is sort of filled with that kind of discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11932.482s">And</a>  you can read about what people in the community, what values other folks who live here wanted to bring. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11938.746s">I</a>  know for myself, one of my highest values is a sense of community and vibrancy and people being able to walk to a place that they <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11948.271s">meet</a>  with their neighbors and really love. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11950.573s">So</a>  that's something I'm always thinking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11952.354s">I</a>  know for Mystic Ave, it really is not a place that people just love to walk down. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11959.92s">So</a>  it's something that we've really been trying to work on is to make Mystic Ave something that serves us as a community and as residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11970.409s">But</a>  another underlying thing that we understand that people want is there to be <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11977.034s">more</a>  new growth right so that new growth is both going to be commercial businesses moving in it's also going to be about new housing that brings in new revenue to the city they both bring in revenue to the city so I think those are among the many different things as well as well as you know we have these new green score that is going to bring more places which I think were mentioned about like <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12000.836s">where</a>  young and old people can, you know, spend time together where there's trees, where there's benches to sit on and places to, you know, to chat. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12008.741s">We're</a>  going to be incentivizing that from developers. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12011.182s">So</a>  these are all things that I think we have, we have brought forward as, as values. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12016.566s">Each</a>  of us individually has values, but we also have some values that came out of the comprehensive plan that we are trying to make happen through the zoning process. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12024.671s">So</a>  thank you so much for asking about that.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12027.052s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12027.512s">Councilor</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12030.421s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12033.103s">I'll</a>  keep it brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12033.904s">I</a>  have a lot to say about this proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12035.225s">I'm</a>  really proud of it, really grateful to all of the staff, the Planning, Development and Sustainability Office that worked on it with us and the zoning consultant and continues to work on it with us and really laid the groundwork for this and other zoning proposals with work in the community over the course of years to really gather the information and the desires from the community that inform <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12057.543s">what</a>  we're doing here, what we know that people want to see around Medford, and how to articulate that in the, yes, rather sterile, but incredibly impactful language of zoning, which when you look at the proposals, looks, you know, if you were like me, not a zoning lawyer, it looks like nothing at first. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12078.858s">But</a>  if you're one of those people who wants to know more and wants to know how our community values, or just you know what you want to see in your community is showing up in the zoning proposals I really do implore you to join us at our planning and permitting committee meetings where this work will be will continue throughout the rest of the fiscal year and possibly beyond that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12095.415s">We</a>  usually meet twice a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12097.577s">Please</a>  do join us. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12099.359s">I</a>  also, and I'm sorry, but just a really minor point. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12101.92s">It's</a>  not the case that you can never ever have a drive-through on Mystic Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12106.043s">In</a>  the commercial district, you could apply for a special permit through the CDB. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12109.505s">So</a>  just a, I believe a very minor fact check to round out this agenda item. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12116.629s">Thank</a>  you for indulging me. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12117.61s">And</a>  with that, I would move the question.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12119.511s">Thank</a>  you, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12120.232s">And</a>  I think, you know, appreciate that correction that, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12124.09s">There</a>  is one of the districts within this corridor, a sub-district that does allow special permit for the drive-thru, that's the commercial district, that is south of Mystic Valley Parkway-Harvard Street intersection and bordering the highway, which tends to be the area with the least possibility of becoming a more walkable area in this district. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12143.849s">The</a>  rest of the district is really primed for becoming a much safer and much less of a, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12149.754s">um</a>  strode as people call them which is a very very wide street that people drive down very very fast and is very very dangerous for anyone who's not in a car and quite frankly is dangerous for people who are in cars um so that is uh some of the values that we put in here um i just want to uh note that this is a long meeting um appreciate folks who've stuck around sometimes these kind of major changes get lost <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12172.893s">in</a>  the sauce of meetings like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12174.454s">That's</a>  happened really a lot this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12176.755s">We've</a>  made a ton of progress this year, and this is a really important ordinance that I think, for me, advances values of safe, well-maintained, and climate-resilient streets and open spaces, housing affordability and stability, and a number of other values that I hold and that I know were part of the reason that I ran for office and continue to run. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12203.812s">It's</a>  a big moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12205.113s">We</a>  have a motion to adopt this proposed amendment to the Medford Zoning Ordinance as amended by adopting the recommendations for amendment by the Community Development Board and the further amendments by Vice President Collins and Councilor Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12220.645s">And</a>  that is as seconded by Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12222.666s">So</a>  on this resolution, the first of many to come in this zoning updates project, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12673.038s">If</a>  you, there we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12675.738s">I'll</a>  give a very brief summary and then Councilor Leming has some amendments that we got sent earlier before this meeting, technical amendments. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12686.724s">I</a>  mean, first, I really just need to thank Councilor Leming and the resident advocates for our immigrant community here in Medford for all the hard work and persistence in trying to get this passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12704.033s">When</a>  I introduced this years ago, I introduced this because I had talked to a lot of friends and a lot of residents who feared for their safety and feared interacting with City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12716.942s">with</a>  our city government and with our institutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12720.511s">And</a>  they didn't know that we have an existing non-cooperative <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12725.683s">a</a>  non-cooperation agreement policy with ICE when it comes to non-criminal matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12732.827s">And,</a>  you know, that's really technical language, but so many cities put it out there and codify it and make it clear where they stand when it comes to the fundamental truths and values of dignity, of community, and of compassion. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12748.254s">I</a>  believe then and I believe now that it's important for Medford to state where we lie, where we stand on these values, on these fundamental truths. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12758.636s">The</a>  next four years are going to be very trying for a lot of people who are so foundational to our community, to our neighbors, to our friends, to our family. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12768.839s">And</a>  it's important, in my opinion, to codify the policies and to give them that security that <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12775.598s">We</a>  already one already have in place but to expand that secure that sense of safety and security for them and give residents a chance to feel safe in their own homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12787.558s">Being</a>  brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12790.077s">about</a>  the content of this resolution is really not that much different from what our city already has in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12796.222s">Our</a>  city administration has reviewed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12798.805s">We've</a>  met about it in committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12800.006s">This</a>  is essentially just codifying and making sure that in the future, this policy can't just be overturned, that residents can know that there is a formality, there is longevity to this policy, and that will be put on the books. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12817.12s">So</a>  I'll stop there and let Councilor Leming provide the amendments. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12824.607s">Going</a>  to Councilor Leming.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12827.95s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12828.27s">I'm</a>  just going to share my screen really quickly to this Google document that I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12834.656s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12836.497s">Can</a>  everybody see that? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12840.841s">Hello?</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12842.042s">It</a>  is visible on the screen.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12843.143s">All</a>  right, great. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12844.837s">So</a>  we went over the text of this in the most recent meeting of the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12854.521s">Following</a>  that meeting, I had some lengthy discussions and feedback from the City's legal teams, as well as some lawyers that work with the ACLU who are involved with Medford People Power. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12870.325s">And</a>  I was kind of doing a little bit of back and forth to figure out what sort of language both parties could agree upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12878.33s">Before</a>  I get into it, I'll also quickly add that this version that I'm working with contains a slight change from what was forwarded to my colleagues earlier today, because just before the meeting, I believe it was Councilor Callaghan who noticed some misspellings under whistleblower protection. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12897.04s">I</a>  ended up amending that in this current draft. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12899.762s">But</a>  essentially, the reviews by the city's legal team <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12908.923s">clarified</a>  the relationship throughout a lot of this ordinance with respect to the city's working relationship with federal agents and federal law and sort of how that works out in practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12922.17s">So</a>  there's a couple of points here. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12925.231s">For</a>  instance, the use of local resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12927.813s">What</a>  you can see here is in green, these are the edits that were provided. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12931.975s">And</a>  these are sort of edits that <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12935.542s">This</a>  kind of covers situations where if someone is detained and they end up getting fingerprinted as a result of a criminal proceeding, then that biometric data would end up going into a sort of a centralized government database, which is just how criminal <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12962.808s">enforcement</a>  works, both on the federal and local level. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12966.391s">But</a>  that doesn't really say, but that's kind of like separate from its potential relationship with ICE. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12974.898s">And</a>  there's just a few, there's a few other things here that <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12980.729s">kind</a>  of that site-specific federal laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12984.352s">One</a>  thing that came up that the ACLU lawyers pointed out was this phrase right here, an officer employee of Medford Police Department may participate or assist with an operation led by a federal immigration agency to detain persons for civil immigration enforcement purposes unless it is in direct response to a request for immediate response on a temporary basis for officer safety purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13009.313s">or</a>  assistance in the apprehension of an individual for whom there is an active arrest warrant issued by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13017.038s">This</a>  officer safety phrase in quotes is actually fairly common to include in these sorts of ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13026.083s">And</a>  there is a history of court decisions about the use of officer safety and asking for assistance. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13034.188s">So</a>  I'm comfortable including that in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13039.78s">Otherwise</a>  the most the biggest changes that Yes.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13045.542s">If</a>  I could just is it fair to say that these amendments reflect the view of legal counsel to ensure that this policy aligns with federal law while maintaining the intent and integrity of the Of the ordinance proposed and the <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13061.38s">policy</a>  that has been in place through the Medford Police Department for the last eight years?</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13066.281s">Yes,</a>  yes, it does. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13067.922s">The</a>  main, so I'll get to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13071.123s">So</a>  the main points that the city brought up was the complaints enforcement, et cetera, bits that were added in there at a point in the editing process where <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13090.26s">We</a>  originally had this complaints, this complaints procedure, but that actually that actually was redundant to the internal policies of the Medford Police Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13101.807s">So</a>  we ended up deleting that and this other cause of action that there that ended up that turns out that that just replicates things that are already in involved in state and federal law. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13113.534s">But</a>  otherwise, yeah, this replicates state and federal laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13116.816s">But</a>  otherwise, these changes <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13120.291s">basically</a>  just make this ordinance consistent with, um, just clarifies the relationship of the ordinance with federal law. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13130.574s">I'd</a>  be pleased to answer any specific questions from my colleagues about it.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13134.515s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Lemmie. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13135.256s">If</a>  you could, um, save a copy of this with no track changes and submit a clean version to the clerk for inclusion in the council records, that would be much appreciated.</p>

    <p>[Encolada]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13144.078s">Will</a>  do. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13144.438s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13146.499s">And</a>  also we need it for the advertisement for second reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13151.921s">With</a>  that, I will go to Councilor Lazzaro, then Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13156.746s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13157.106s">I</a>  just wanted to clarify one thing that this is something that is already in practice for the Medford Police Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13163.432s">We</a>  discussed this in our committee meeting at length, but I did want to say for folks gathered here today that may not have been at the committee meeting that <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13174.989s">When</a>  we put something like this in an ordinance, it's much more difficult if something were to change down the road to, you know, change a policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13186.872s">is</a>  something you can do kind of quickly to change an ordinance, it would be much more complicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13190.714s">So</a>  we're enshrining something that is practiced now in our city ordinances so that it's something that we are affirming and saying that it is something that we believe in very firmly, that this is something that is part of our local laws and it will be hard to <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13212.486s">turn</a>  around. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13214.328s">It's</a>  something that I think is very important, and I think it's important that we're doing it tonight, and I appreciate all the work that's gone into it thus far. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13220.773s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13222.414s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13222.774s">I'll</a>  go to Councilor Scarpelli, then Vice President Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13224.756s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13225.876s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13226.977s">First,</a>  I want to thank Barry and Marie. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13232.506s">having</a>  a conversation and really having an open dialogue. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13236.168s">I</a>  think that we expressed a lot of information about this ordinance and having my support. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13243.353s">And</a>  I think that my biggest concern are two basic issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13247.896s">And</a>  one thing I'll ask is, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13250.397s">as</a>  I get started is I'd like to see this to be tabled so we can sit with the chief because I don't think that we've had a conversation with the chief and understand the impacts with the police department when we make an ordinance and how it could conflict with the city ordinance and what his job requires him to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13269.083s">So</a>  I think that he, you know, I think that that's, you know, the understanding that the ACLU, the support and the involvement of the ACLU has left some residents questioning, you know, their beliefs in what policing is and what this means with this ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13287.629s">So</a>  I think that <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13290.495s">the</a>  understanding the slippery slopes when we talk about, we talk about this, this ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13296.299s">And</a>  when I've talked to the chief and I've talked to city officials, when chief Sacco put together the federal immigration enforcement plan and really put this in place, you know, they shared that, you know, the number one priority is our community safety and comfort of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13312.131s">And</a>  I think it's important because I think this is very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13315.554s">I</a>  don't think I can sit here <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13320.006s">and</a>  attest that as a city councilor, I've sat in a house, I've stood in a house with six ICE agents and a family of undocumented members of a community and, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13332.6s">I</a>  know the fear. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13333.301s">I</a>  understand it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13334.102s">But</a>  I also think that when we move something toward an ordinance, I think we need to do our due diligence and make sure that we really have the information and we're all coming into this as a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13345.352s">And</a>  I talked to the chief and the chief has been part of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13350.277s">This</a>  is a very important piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13351.658s">I</a>  think that having the chief of police sit down with our body and say, what are some limitations? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13359.322s">What</a>  are some concerns? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13360.662s">How</a>  do we fix that? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13361.763s">How</a>  do we express it? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13363.284s">How</a>  do we bring it forward so we can move forward? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13366.145s">That</a>  hasn't been done yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13367.185s">So</a>  I think that's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13368.886s">I</a>  think before we move forward, I think <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13370.607s">that</a>  table moving into a meeting to sit with the chief and understand that this is a process so we can all understand what the ramification is as a law enforcement officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13380.591s">Because</a>  we don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13381.711s">We're</a>  doing something that means well, and we want to do something to protect people, which is good. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13387.213s">But</a>  I think we're talking about an ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13388.733s">I</a>  think we need all the information. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13390.034s">I</a>  don't think we have done that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13390.914s">And</a>  the other piece, and I would also like to invite the administration, the financial director, for the other impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13400.729s">it</a>  is gonna be a different time in a few weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13406.271s">And</a>  we've seen it openly discussed how communities that put ordinances or rules in place like this, that the national agenda is to harm us financially with federal funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13421.676s">So</a>  I think we need to also understand that platform. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13424.978s">So</a>  again, it's not something that, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13429.332s">this</a>  council is not supporting for the good reasons, but I think it's important that we get all the information out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13434.217s">I</a>  know it's goodwill. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13436.299s">It</a>  feels good. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13437.02s">People</a>  have done some great work and really put a lot of passion into this, and I commend them. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13442.665s">But</a>  again, I can't support this unless we do our due diligence and sit down with the <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13448.703s">probably</a>  the most important person in this community, the person that actually does our policing. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13453.007s">And</a>  he's always been involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13455.09s">He's</a>  always been welcoming to come sit down with us and share his opinion and see what our police department and what those impacts means when you talk about <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13466.596s">changing</a>  an ordinance to what they do every day by law and how that might be intertwined in a negative fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13473.679s">So</a>  I think that's something that I'm going to stand with and I hope my colleagues can understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13479.622s">So</a>  thank you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13483.723s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13485.203s">I</a>  want to first start by thanking the community members that have been advocating this for a very long time, and then Councilors Tseng and Leming for leading on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13495.226s">To</a>  me, what this ordinance project says is the city's existing policy of non-cooperation with federal ICE agents is so good and makes so much sense and is so common sense that we should enshrine that as a city ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13511.391s">And</a>  I just agree with that wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13513.672s">To</a>  me, what this says is we want to protect Medford resources for the purpose of taking care of Medford residents, not for carrying out orders or agendas that were promulgated somewhere far away from here, not in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13530.076s">Our</a>  resources, our personnel, the expertise and the time of our public safety officials, people doing that work in our community, that should be for us, not for a national agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13544.641s">and</a>  not for the agenda of any other state or entity. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13547.924s">So</a>  for that reason, I think it's really the right time. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13549.665s">I</a>  think any time would be a good time to enshrine that existing policy as an ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13553.708s">I</a>  think this is, I think the moment is now. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13556.85s">I'm</a>  really proud of my fellow Councilors for putting this together and making sure that <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13562.374s">you</a>  know, this policy that the current administration and city staff and public safety officers have been doing just because it's the right thing to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13569.339s">And</a>  it was obviously the right policy to have that we can make sure that that is protected for the future, come what may. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13576.905s">With</a>  that, I'd motion to approve for our first reading.</p>
