    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=625.007s">Councilor</a>  Callahan, Vice President Collins, Councilor Lazzaro, Councilor Leming, present. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=633.21s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli, Councilor Tseng, President Bears, present, seven present, none absent.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=638.311s">The</a>  meeting is called to order. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=639.192s">Please</a>  rise to salute the flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=654.229s">Before</a>  we start, this is our last meeting of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=657.13s">And</a>  I do ask my colleagues for limited indulgence and welcome the crowd for being here as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=665.111s">I</a>  just wanna thank my colleagues for an incredible 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=668.452s">It's</a>  been a busy year of nearly a hundred meetings of this body and committee and in regular session. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=677.194s">And</a>  I don't think anyone can say that this council has not been outspoken and spoken its mind on a variety of topics. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=683.888s">In</a>  January, I spoke about three leadership principles, collaboration, planning, and trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=689.973s">This</a>  council has worked together collaboratively within our committees with the city administration, city staff, community organizations, businesses, educational institutions, and thousands of residents to implement and discuss a clear and transparent governing agenda created and published in February. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=710.117s">Tomorrow</a>  night we're going to conduct our one year review of that plan and suggest updates for the year ahead and I encourage everyone in our city to join us. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=719.16s">I</a>  firmly believe that this open and direct approach to governance is foundational to good governance and to trust, and I'm going to continue to lead with these principles in 2025. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=730.365s">There's</a>  always disagreement, and we've had some tough meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=734.761s">I'm</a>  always open to meet with anyone, whether that's Councilors, residents, employees of the city and others to hear from them. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=741.665s">And</a>  of course, this council will always hear from anyone who speaks at this podium under our rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=747.509s">I'm</a>  excited for 2025. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=750.65s">Earlier</a>  this week, released our January to June schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=753.872s">There</a>  are 60 meetings scheduled on topics including the budget, a new city charter, zoning and much more. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=762.284s">And</a>  I really just want to implore and invite the community to join us in the process of building a better Medford together. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=768.776s">So</a>  thank you for your indulgence. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=770.479s">And</a>  with that, we'll move to the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=774.44s">Announcements,</a>  accolades, remembrances, reports, and records. <a href="../resolutions/24-512.pdf"><font color="green">24-512</font></a> offered by Councilor Scarpelli.
 <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=781.946s">Be</a>  it resolved that the Medford City Council commend and congratulate Barbara Kerr for her 40 years of tireless and selfless service at the Medford Public Library. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=790.072s">We</a>  thank her for her work with our residents and for providing a welcoming hub for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=795.236s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=796.956s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=798.297s">And</a>  when you talk about, imagine doing anything for 40 years, how impressive that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=804.343s">And</a>  what Barbara has endured for 40 years at <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=810.506s">The</a>  beginning is a library, it's running a library and then a subpar library, then a failing library with ceilings caving in and then going through the process of a new library and maintaining an opportunity in pilot libraries across the city and working together with former City Council President Caraviello to bring to fruition a new library in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=838.116s">a</a>  cornerstone now, a great piece of our Medford Square entrance, and to see what Barbara has given to our community, something needs to be commended. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=850.851s">If</a>  I can, if I could, I would recommend, Council President, that <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=854.515s">We</a>  have Barbara here at one of our upcoming meetings so we can present her with a citation with appreciation for all of our hard work for the citizens and the residents of Medford and working at our Medford Public Library for 40 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=869.805s">Very</a>  impressive. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=870.526s">So</a>  thank you, Barbara, for all your hard work.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=872.868s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=874.208s">Councilor</a>  Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=875.834s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=876.534s">Um,</a>  thank you, Councilor Scarpelli for putting this on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=880.537s">Barbara</a>  is such a foundational part of what makes the public library tick. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=886.06s">And</a>  as you noted, and I think as we can all agree, our library is a gem of Medford Square and it's a gem of the Medford community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=895.103s">Tons</a>  of people come from out of the city to use it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=898.245s">Our</a>  residents, I think, very much treasure it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=901.067s">And</a>  Barbara's hard work is what makes it tick. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=904.989s">She</a>  works so hard when it comes to making sure the library has the resources she needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=909.932s">It</a>  needs making sure that there's enough programming for <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=915.769s">of</a>  wide range of Medford residents, despite their age, their background, making sure that people feel welcome in that space as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=923.418s">Her</a>  hard work on getting the new library built, as is, is also something that our city council should really recognize and be thankful for. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=935.051s">also</a>  relevant to the City Council is the work that she puts into letting us know what resources the library needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=942.493s">I</a>  know a lot of us have been at the annual sit-downs before the budget season with the library staff and the Board of Trustees where they let us know what they need. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=953.437s">And</a>  that's a testament to her organization and her energy doing that work and fighting for the public library. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=961.563s">I'm</a>  very grateful for this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=963.205s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli for introducing it.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=966.188s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=967.129s">Vice</a>  President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=969.633s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=970.534s">Thank</a>  you as well, Councilor Scarpelli for putting this on and making sure that we properly recognized Director Kerr for her 40 incredible years leading the Medford Public Library. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=981.841s">You</a>  know, a lot great has been said about Barbara. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=985.223s">We</a>  could go on all night just talking about Barbara, but what really strikes me about her from all the meetings we've had with her over the past three years is she brings <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=993.007s">Obviously,</a>  so much skill so much knowledge so much experience to run the library and she's been doing this for four decades and she's made sure that our library remains contemporary over the years and she really fought to make sure that we can now enjoy a public modern contemporary public library and. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1009.744s">You</a>  know, some people know really well just how, just how much hard work and advocacy and how many risks it took to make it the incredible, you know, really model library that it is today. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1020.032s">So</a>  we can't thank her enough, not just for the recent, you know, really, really visible accomplishments, but for all of the work that preceded that to bring us to the community space that we get to enjoy and that we'll get to enjoy for so many years to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1030.76s">So</a>  thank you, Barbara. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1031.901s">We</a>  could truly go on all night talking about her. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1034.083s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1036.397s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins, and I just want to note certainly to thank Barbara, and I think Barbara would also want us to thank her staff, the trustees, the Library Foundation, which has been so instrumental in the construction of and outfitting of the new library, the friends of the Medford Public Library, and all of the folks who walk through those doors or use the online resources or take out a book <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1063.329s">or</a>  other material at the library has really become so much more than just a place to go and get a book, but it really provides essential community services to so many people in our community, especially our kids and our teens. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1075.975s">So</a>  just thank you to Barbara and the whole library team. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1080.377s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Tseng, and we will invite Director Kerr for a citation in the new year. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1088.561s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1653.706s">I</a>  have slides that we showed last night, but what I was going to offer is that I would give you a brief summary and why now. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1662.112s">And</a>  then if the city council would like to do a committee of the whole with the materials that we had last night at the early January before the third reading, assuming that the council is willing to do the first reading tonight, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1678.484s">We'd</a>  be happy to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1680.025s">We</a>  also, the timing of this is that we're asking for $5 million now to get the project, we've been started, but to get a number of the design work done and long lead time items purchased. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1694.469s">There</a>  are some items we would like to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1696.51s">We</a>  expect to have the air conditioning working by September. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1699.571s">To</a>  do that, some of the equipment has more than 16 weekly times. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1703.973s">And</a>  so we would like to order that equipment as quickly as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1707.574s">So</a>  we're asking for the $5 million now for the early work and the funding to take the design to 100% design and to bring the construction manager at risk on. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1718.978s">And</a>  then our intention is to come back <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1721.141s">either</a>  in late March or early April and ask for additional money that would be the rest of the money for this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1726.803s">This</a>  is not a $5 million project. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1728.944s">This</a>  is more like a $25 million project. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1733.125s">And</a>  we would be happy to do a committee of the whole first week of January, second week of January, if you'd like. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1739.671s">or</a>  we can end or we could do a more complete once we have 100% construction documents in March, a committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1747.618s">I'm</a>  also prepared to share some slides this evening or go into some more of the details this evening, but I didn't wanna take an hour out of a city council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1754.665s">I</a>  wanted to give you the basics tonight and then schedule something longer in early January.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1784.605s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1785.506s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1786.146s">I'm</a>  glad that <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1791.391s">I</a>  would welcome that we go, we revert this to a committee of the whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1795.655s">I</a>  think that when you're talking something about in the process of a $25 million project, I think this is where we need to sit down before we vote on anything and just look into the finances and what <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1807.216s">where</a>  we're going in our community and where we are since the override. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1811.278s">I</a>  know that there are big questions out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1814.3s">What</a>  are we still doing with the fire department? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1816.201s">What</a>  are we doing with the new high school if that comes down the line? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1819.563s">How</a>  much money will we be able to bond? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1821.504s">So</a>  it'll be interesting to get those questions answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1823.485s">And</a>  to approve $5 million not knowing, with some clarity for the other $20 million, I think that would <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1829.997s">that</a>  would be irresponsible for us to move that forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1833.478s">So</a>  I would recommend that we move this completely to a committee of the whole meeting so we can look at the different options. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1839.081s">I</a>  know there's been some talk that there's been some money freed up from ARPA due to the override success. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1846.623s">So</a>  it'd be interesting to see if we can use other avenues to look into possible ways to fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1853.506s">So</a>  I know it's needed, not saying that I wouldn't support it, but I think that <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1858.768s">for</a>  one council, and we're talking about being stewards of our budgetary process, I think it's important that we sit down and evaluate the whole financial process. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1868.634s">It's</a>  nice that the school committee voted 7-0 because they should. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1873.117s">They</a>  want everything fixed, but they don't control the budgetary process, and I think it's important that this council really understands our whole, because I believe we talked about this too, Council President, is understanding our <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1887.785s">capital</a>  plan and understanding where we're going with that capital plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1891.028s">So</a>  I would recommend, I appreciate your thoughts and your leadership, but I would recommend we go directly to community to the whole with this process from beginning to end. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1901.416s">So</a>  thank you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1902.745s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1903.105s">Before</a>  I recognize Councilor Collins and Councilor Callahan, I do just want to note on the ARPA funding that has to be encumbered by December 31st. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1912.251s">And</a>  we did receive a communication from the mayor at a large chunk of that 800,000 plus dollars that we were able to buy a fire engine from the city of Lynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1921.796s">So</a>  there's a new fire engine coming through that money. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1925.018s">So</a>  a large chunk of that money has been appropriated. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1927.9s">It</a>  does have to be encumbered by the end of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1929.601s">I'll</a>  go to Vice President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1933.837s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1934.537s">Thank</a>  you so much for being with us tonight and thank you for being with the school committee yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1938.718s">I</a>  know it's a really busy time of year, but it's really exciting to see that this project is being pushed forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1945.9s">We've</a>  been hearing about the HVAC issues in Medford Public Schools for a really long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1951.701s">It</a>  feels like forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1953.001s">And</a>  it's exciting to be at a point where we can be talking about pre-implementation and implementation of the projects that will <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1960.923s">allow</a>  the schools to remain the comfortable temperatures that students can learn and thrive in. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1967.346s">Before</a>  any motions are made, I'd be eager to hear that kind of like brief synopsis about the bird's eye view, why now to kind of get our heads around the urgency around this. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1977.711s">To</a>  me, we've been hearing from parents and educators for such a long time about the really severe heating and cooling issues in the Medford public schools that I feel pretty comfortable taking a vote on this ASAP. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1987.715s">but</a>  I'd like to hear your presentation first. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1989.436s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1989.956s">Or</a>  the short form your presentation first, to be clear, not the hour long version. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1993.318s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1996.199s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1996.459s">I'll</a>  go to Councilor Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1999.701s">Steal</a>  my thunder. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2000.621s">I</a>  basically was going to see if you had, like, how short is your short version of your presentation? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2004.823s">And</a>  if there's something you can give that's five minutes or less that can really give us an overview. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2009.965s">And</a>  as well, if you can also give us a little bit of an understanding of <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2016.669s">exactly</a>  how important the timing is and whether getting something, you know, obviously this is a process, it would not be approved tonight, it has three readings, whether us bringing it forward tonight is crucial to the timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2030.463s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2038.52s">Council</a>  President, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2039.96s">We</a>  have with us tonight our owners project manager, Tom Ellis, and I believe that it would make sense for him to actually address the questions of the timing and the urgency that it feels like he's prepared to speak to why and how that timing would work. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2057.045s">And</a>  I think that's better than trying to go through all the materials about the whole thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2062.766s">So</a>  why don't I introduce Tom and I'll let him explain.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2066.121s">Thank</a>  you, Tom. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2066.962s">Go</a>  ahead.</p>

    <p>[Ellis]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2067.784s">Thank</a>  you for inviting me today. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2070.068s">Yes,</a>  the timing of the project financing is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2074.859s">We've</a>  started the design process and have learned a lot about what the needs are for the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2079.523s">It's</a>  a very complex effort to try to keep the schools occupied, as well as make these adjustments in the mechanical systems and replacing them. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2089.911s">Basically,</a>  replacing the engine while you're trying to keep the car moving. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2093.814s">So</a>  it's going to be a challenge to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2096.076s">But</a>  to do so, we're using a construction management risk delivery method, which allows <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2101.488s">the</a>  builder to be engaged in the process because there's a lot of logistics involved with keeping the schools open, how we're going to do the work to keep it safe, to keep the air quality in the school correct as we do the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2114.718s">But</a>  to do so, we need to engage the construction manager early in 2025. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2122.249s">2025.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2123.009s">And</a>  to do so, we need the funding to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2125.03s">So</a>  we need the pre-construction services fee to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2128.491s">We</a>  need to keep the design team moving forward with additional funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2132.912s">And</a>  we also need funds for early purchasing of the mechanical equipment, and it's in excess of $3 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2140.755s">And</a>  because of the supply chain issues with mechanical systems that could take anywhere 16 to 20 weeks to whenever, we need to get that material and equipment ordered quickly and soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2153.462s">So</a>  that's the urgency involved is to get the equipment there so that we can start the work over the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2159.045s">and</a>  get most of the work done, it will continue into the fall, but to get the air conditioning systems operational. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2165.011s">So</a>  hopefully in August, the school will have air conditioning available. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2170.977s">So</a>  that's the urgency of the issue of trying to get the funding to start the work soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2175.902s">So</a>  I think that's kind of the big overview at this point.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2181.431s">And</a>  so I'll just, I think that this council knows this, I will sort of repeat it for the public, that in approving something like this, there would be a first reading, there would be an advertising period, and there would be a third reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2193.905s">So</a>  it wouldn't necessarily, and like this evening there was a third reading that went through very, very quickly because you were all very well briefed on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2201.253s">at</a>  the first reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2203.213s">I</a>  would respectfully request that you consider a first reading tonight and a committee of the whole in January and the advertising to be able to then consider this on the January 15th meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2214.656s">I</a>  think it's the 15th, 14th. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2217.916s">Just</a>  to keep this moving, I think your next meeting in January would be around the 31st, 28th. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2224.798s">My</a>  apologies, I didn't put a calendar up. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2227.762s">And</a>  it would be great to be able to get these things because the contracting can take a couple weeks, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2233.45s">So</a>  that's the timeline that we're really looking on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2240.114s">I</a>  had one other thing, but it slipped my mind, so sorry.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2243.675s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2243.915s">I'll</a>  go to Vice President Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2245.435s">Oh,</a>  sorry, Mr. Cushing, then Vice President Collins and Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2247.776s">I</a>  also just really want to talk about the why. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2250.396s">So</a>  as I have mentioned numerous times before the distinguished school body, the reality is that Medford still sees these buildings as the new schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2260.878s">As</a>  Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, hopefully they will be supplanted by a new Med or renovated Medford High School in a few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2269.5s">These</a>  buildings have a lifespan at 23 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2274.383s">There</a>  are significant challenges with the HVAC systems in those buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2279.346s">This</a>  project initially started with a comprehensive review of the Andrews Middle School, and not to be outdone, the McGlynn systems failed significantly more rapidly over the last few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2292.975s">There</a>  are large swaths of that building, including gyms, auditorium, cafeteria, that have little to no air conditioning whatsoever. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2300.978s">Classroom</a>  units, rooftop units that cool the classrooms have failed. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2307.821s">And</a>  the Andrews Middle School has had problems since the building was first opened. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2313.963s">It</a>  has been termed by our engineers who work on it from a vendor as just having consistent gremlins over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2322.726s">There</a>  are issues with both of these buildings that cause a substantial detriment to student learning, staff functionality, and potentially giving climate change the health and safety of our students and staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2336.271s">There's</a>  a moment to act where that can be put on the table for the upcoming FY26 academic year. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2347.194s">If</a>  we wait, if we wait, that will delay our ability to deploy these systems so that classrooms are cooled. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2355.338s">The</a>  gyms and other large areas will come online shortly thereafter, probably middle-ish of September. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2362.402s">I</a>  want to be clear that the first systems that will be completed will be the water side, which services the classrooms, and then will be the large spaces that are done by forced air. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2377.765s">I've</a>  presented in front of the school committee numerous times on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2380.766s">It</a>  has consumed a large part of the school district's energies over the past several years. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2386.267s">And</a>  I'm here to basically beg on behalf of the staff and students of these schools that we advance this project with multiple readings. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2399.721s">you'll</a>  have the opportunity to pull back if our presentations don't meet your expectations. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2404.743s">But</a>  this is what I would consider to be a moral obligation to make sure that these facilities that service our students, many of whom may be vulnerable for any number of reasons, provide the environment that is needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2419.049s">There</a>  is also, hopefully, that we can slide in ahead with some of this ordering to avoid the impending tariffs <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2427.873s">that</a>  have been described by the incoming administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2431.016s">It</a>  is a significant, the audience may laugh, but it is a significant concern of our team putting this together about what the cost implications may be moving forward.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2443.287s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Cushing. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2444.127s">I</a>  don't think anyone's excited for the 30 percent cost increases we're all about to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2448.071s">Vice</a>  President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2452.438s">Thank</a>  you for the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2454.02s">Thank</a>  you for the succinctness. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2457.743s">Certainly,</a>  I don't think that any of us think that our students and educators and school staff should be put in the position of having to beg for classrooms that are a temperature at which you can focus and deliver good education and learn and be comfortable enough to get through the day and really get something out of <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2472.857s">the</a>  education that Medford Public Schools offers. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2476.298s">And</a>  I would be really happy to work with President Bears to make sure that we can get a committee of the whole on the January schedule as quickly as possible so that we can advance this tonight, if it is the will of the council, do our due diligence, and then try to get this out the door. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2488.703s">Because</a>  I do understand, you know, I think anybody who has any passing familiarity with projects of this scale, you know, I know that we have a really tight timeframe that you're trying to get this done in so that these improvements are up and running for the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2500.167s">of</a>  the next school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2501.248s">And</a>  if we miss that window, that manifests in unhappy students and unhappy educators and unhappy families. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2507.534s">So</a>  with that, I would motion to approve for first reading and for city council leadership to work to schedule a committee of the whole for more in-depth conversation at our first opportunity in January.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2520.905s">Council</a>  Vice President Collins has motioned to approve for first reading and to schedule a committee of the whole in early January prior to third reading for a more in-depth presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2529.688s">Is</a>  there a second on that motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2530.728s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2532.929s">Several.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2533.93s">I'll</a>  go with Councilor Lazzaro and then I will go to Councilor Scarpelli for further discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2543.953s">Yeah,</a>  I'm just gonna go to Councilor Scarpelli and then Councilor</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2552.29s">Oh,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2553.05s">Can</a>  you hear me? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2554.751s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2555.252s">I</a>  can just see social media today saying, quote, Councilor Scarpelli doesn't want to keep the kids warm and the teachers cool in the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2562.315s">So</a>  let's be realistic. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2565.737s">That's</a>  number one priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2567.138s">We</a>  all know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2568.058s">But</a>  we also want to make sure that when I taught there 15 years ago, we had the same issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2574.182s">So</a>  we understand that have to get done. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2575.903s">But</a>  what I'm saying is I don't see a few weeks <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2579.349s">to</a>  track back and really understand the total process. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2582.39s">Now,</a>  all due respect, Tom, thank you for your presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2585.131s">I</a>  don't even know who you are. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2585.931s">Are</a>  we paying you? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2587.572s">Like</a>  we don't, there's processes like, you know, how is the procurement process look? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2593.874s">How</a>  are we going to, has issues with the MSBA been approved yet for 25 million? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2600.117s">Have</a>  we <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2600.877s">have</a>  we looked at other avenues do we look at the trajectory of our city's finances when we're looking to how we're going to bomb this so i think that this is this isn't something that we're saying at least this council saying that i don't want this this is council wants to just bring it back and look at this in totality not because the city school committee voted seven nothing because we have issues like the air condition is not going to work in august <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2625.196s">This</a>  is a few weeks that we slow things down and go through the process the correct way. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2629.322s">And</a>  that's to see the full health of our financial future here in the city of Medford because I'd like to know, there might be more. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2637.252s">There</a>  might be more that we don't know about because this is coming up <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2641.323s">that</a>  we have to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2641.803s">We</a>  have to look at what's relatively new and how quick this is and how much it's going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2644.586s">Where</a>  as we look forward, there might be more that the mayor has has planned, but we don't know about that says, Well, there's another five million that we have to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2652.412s">So</a>  the kids can go into a safe school. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2654.914s">Maybe</a>  something's wrong with the doors. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2656.876s">We</a>  don't know yet because we haven't been discussing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2659.658s">All</a>  we received is this this motion for a loan order and to <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2669.85s">my</a>  council vice president bring that forward and was seconded, but I won't be supporting it for the fact that I'd rather have the meeting before we put five, move $5 million that we can start the process before we know truly what our fiscal overview looks like in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2685.664s">Cause</a>  that's something that's been questioned multiple times in the last few months. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2690.028s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2691.589s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2692.049s">Councilor</a>  Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2695.273s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2696.294s">Um,</a>  I do feel comfortable voting yes on the first reading tonight, and I'll explain why I've been following this conversation for, as you've noted, this has been a conversation for years, and especially in recent months with school committee meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2710.488s">There</a>  are materials out there for us to look at and I know they haven't come straight to the city council yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2715.393s">Um,</a>  this is <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2717.976s">an</a>  issue of urgency for a lot of our students for, as you said, for health, for safety, for student performance, for functionality, for our teachers sake. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2729.518s">I</a>  know a lot of, you know, things were, in my experience, they're having problems in the past with the HVAC system from what teachers and students have told me and parents have told me that things have only gotten worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2743.48s">I</a>  think Councilor Scarpelli does raise good questions about how this fits into our financial plan going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2751.447s">And</a>  I do know that this is something that has been at the forefront of financial planning for our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2756.552s">We've</a>  known about this cost that was going to come before us for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2762.23s">for</a>  longer than I've been on the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2765.193s">But</a>  you know what, there are questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2767.535s">And</a>  I think all of us behind the rail are in agreement that a committee, the whole meeting would be good and helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2774.262s">The</a>  reason why I feel comfortable voting yes on the first reading is as you noted, votes can change. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2778.967s">We</a>  can decide to vote this down on the third reading if our answers aren't resolved or questions aren't resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2787.063s">Um,</a>  I think, functionally voting yes on a first reading tonight and both voting for cancer, Scarf Ellie's motion on lead us to very similar places, the difference being the two week gap, the, the, the potentially even more than two weeks gap. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2804.565s">that</a>  pushing this off would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2807.026s">I</a>  think it's really important to underscore to everyone watching at home and here that that time does matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2813.609s">That</a>  timeline does matter for the success of a city's project. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2818.391s">There</a>  are tons of projects out there that we've had to wait a cycle or put on hold because we weren't able to get the bids out in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2826.654s">We</a>  weren't able to do X, Y, Z. And it's really important that we meet the timelines as is. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2833.891s">I</a>  think it'd be helpful for the council going forward if we could submit some questions to city staff before the committee, the whole meeting, if we could see some of the slides before that meeting as well, just to expedite that conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2848.08s">I</a>  think we can have a very rich and deep conversation about, you know, the questions that my fellow councillors have raised about the need and urgency for this going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2858.947s">And</a>  I think we can have that depth of conversation as long as we're prepared for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2865.694s">Thank</a>  you counsel is our.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2868.456s">Thank</a>  you, thank you for your presentation, I think we can also probably watch the school committee meeting from yesterday in between now and when we have our committee of the whole and review that presentation as well which could be really beneficial to all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2880.883s">I</a>  feel comfortable voting yes for this I also think that when you mentioned the gremlins. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2885.302s">There</a>  may have been, I'm not sure if this happened, but there may have been some measures taken in the prior projects being done that we could avoid this time around. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2897.969s">Hopefully</a>  we won't have gremlins in this project and we can have just a really solid foundation with this HVAC system. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2906.354s">I</a>  would hope we could avoid that this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2909.516s">So</a>  thank you, I appreciate you coming here and presenting this. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2913.518s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2915.687s">On</a>  the motion of Vice President Collins as amended to request a committee of the whole in January, please wait, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2923.17s">On</a>  the motion of Vice President Collins to request a committee of the whole and also amended by Councilor Tseng to request the slides be shared with the council by email and also that councilors can submit questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2936.817s">Should</a>  they submit them to you Director Hunt and Assistant Superintendent Cushing directly? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2940.678s">Great,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2943.039s">Vice</a>  President Collins, do you have anything further? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2947.403s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2948.485s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2948.805s">Before</a>  we vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2949.346s">I</a>  just wanted to appreciate my Councilor discussion of this item. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2952.59s">I'm</a>  very much looking forward to the committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2954.713s">I</a>  also just wanted to follow up and <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2957.571s">to</a>  make clear just because of the way that it's being talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2961.334s">This</a>  is a request for a loan order for $5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2966.057s">I</a>  don't want people to come away with the impression that the city is, after this vote, writing a check for $5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2971.081s">That's</a>  not the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2972.722s">The</a>  loan order, you know, this is a process that we very, very, very commonly use for large capital expenses like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2979.327s">This</a>  is normal to take out a loan order for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2981.288s">It's</a>  like the way this is normally done. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2982.769s">We're</a>  not just writing a check from some <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2985.491s">city</a>  checking account. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2986.372s">That's</a>  not how this works. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2987.992s">Um,</a>  and I just, you know, I've had so many conversations with constituents about heating and cooling in MPS buildings for so many years that I really would be remiss to not just affirm that this is not a new project. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2999.437s">This</a>  is really a harm that people have been feeling for years, and I'm glad that we're acting on it now, but we're actually we're acting on it late. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3007.18s">So</a>  thank you for getting us to this point where we can be acting on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3010.362s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3011.383s">Thank</a>  you, and I know you guys wanted to maybe respond or answer any further questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3015.026s">I</a>  just wanted to note that this project has been on the radar. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3018.008s">It</a>  was in a previous capital improvement plan, and it was one of the reasons for the question six vote, because it was a large project that came up. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3028.675s">The</a>  proposed question six did not succeed, but it was why it was on the ballot.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3034.039s">Thank</a>  you, Council President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3036.16s">I</a>  did want to just clarify two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3038.421s">So</a>  we do actually have Bob Dickinson on the Zoom this evening because of this, if there were specific questions for him. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3045.504s">And</a>  I did just want to clarify the roles that Tom is our owner's project manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3050.766s">He</a>  was hired in June and has been working with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3053.347s">We've</a>  been meeting weekly since mid-August. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3055.908s">Our</a>  designers came on board in August. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3058.349s">We've</a>  been using ARPA funding to fund the early work on this as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3064.111s">So</a>  the designers, Dr. Cushing, myself, our climate planner, and the designers in OPM have been meeting weekly since August on this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3075.26s">We</a>  did need to get to a certain point in design. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3077.642s">We</a>  are right now at 30% design, which is complete schematics. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3083.507s">And</a>  we needed to have that information in order to know <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3087.55s">how</a>  much to ask for in this bond and how much to be able to predict in the future one. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3092.693s">So</a>  I do feel like this is why, why didn't you come like a month ago? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3096.795s">Because</a>  we needed the 30% design or also known as the schematic design to be completed before we could ask for this money. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3105.179s">And</a>  now we'll be moving into the next steps in design development. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3109.382s">I</a>  just sort of thought that was very helpful to clarify that.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3112.81s">Thank</a>  you, Director Hunt. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3113.671s">Any</a>  further questions by members of the Council for Director Hunt, Dr. Cushing, or for Director Dickinson on Zoom? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3123.6s">Seeing</a>  none, we'll go to open this up for any public comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3128.264s">You</a>  can either show up at the podium or raise your hand on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3130.826s">This</a>  is only for this paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3132.588s">If</a>  you have comment on this specific paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3135.631s">Seeing</a>  no hands on Zoom, we'll go to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3137.532s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3138.553s">You</a>  have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Jean Nuzzo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3140.792s">Hi,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3141.333s">I</a>  don't need three minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3142.695s">My</a>  name is Jean Nuzzo. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3143.536s">I</a>  live at Parr Street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3145.398s">I</a>  just have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3146.52s">I'd</a>  like to know where the technical documentation and feasibility study and projected budget for this can be found for consumption. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3154.069s">Is</a>  it available online or does a FOIA request need to be submitted?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3158.697s">I</a>  believe the materials are available in the school committee packet from last night. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3162.941s">I'll</a>  defer to Director Hunt.</p>

    <p>[Jean Nuzzo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3164.001s">The</a>  technical documents? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3165.423s">I'm</a>  sorry, I'm deferring to, excuse me.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3167.304s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3167.664s">Director</a>  Hunt, do you have an answer to that question? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3169.766s">Or</a>  Mr. Ellis?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3175.31s">You</a>  need to speak into the microphone. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3177.552s">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ellis]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3179.053s">Sure,</a>  yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3179.593s">The</a>  feasibility study was initially done, I believe it was over a year ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3184.537s">So</a>  that document is <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3186.03s">is</a>  available. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3186.85s">I</a>  don't know exactly where. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3188.551s">I</a>  didn't put it on the web.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3190.612s">But</a>  it's on the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3191.552s">It</a>  was considered by the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3192.913s">It's</a>  on the school website.</p>

    <p>[Ellis]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3193.813s">It's</a>  a public document because it's part of our solicitation. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3197.995s">So</a>  yes, that information is out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3199.896s">We</a>  just received the schematic design documents from the design team. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3203.838s">So</a>  that's being used right now as a process. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3205.979s">We</a>  haven't posted that anywhere at this time.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3208.24s">But</a>  it will be posted on the Medford Public Schools website.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3214.082s">So</a>  we have not contemplated right now how we're going to publicize and follow through with this, but we will, as we've done in previous projects, and as you'll see coming up in a few days here, right now the Brooks is going through a complete hot water replacement because that failed back in May. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3234.648s">Thank</a>  you very much for supporting that effort as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3237.55s">You'll</a>  be seeing pictures and you'll be seeing that project being updated on our Facebook page. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3242.993s">And</a>  we will also have the construction page somewhere on our website. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3246.375s">I'm</a>  happy to put all the documents up. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3248.556s">They</a>  are mostly on the school committee page. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3253.399s">So</a>  if you go and you search the school committee package, you're able to find it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3256.861s">Person</a>  does not need to file a four-year request. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3258.862s">I'm</a>  happy to share anyone who wants to go through schematic design documents and electrical engineering documents. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3264.186s">I</a>  welcome it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3265.227s">Maybe</a>  they can find some efficiencies.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3267.311s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Jean Nuzzo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3267.731s">I</a>  would, and thank you for the answer.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3269.855s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3270.416s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Cushing. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3272.018s">Is</a>  your email pcushing at medford.k12.ma.us? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3274.963s">It</a>  is. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3275.184s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3278.815s">Any</a>  further public comments, name and address for the record please you have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Nate Merritt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3284.48s">Nate</a>  Merritt, 373 Riverside Ave. I'm sure everyone's aware that, you know, the members of the city residents are maybe a little nervous concern you know upcoming tax hikes and all that, want to make sure that our dollars are spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3296.525s">most</a>  efficiently possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3298.365s">Was</a>  there a course of action given for just say replacement of the existing systems that, you know, replacement parts versus upgrades and it's not clear from the paper, what's an upgrade? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3311.748s">Is</a>  it, you know, is the roof currently leaking now or is the roof upgrade because of the solar panel installation that's also planned and is that an upgrade versus replacing the parts that are broken for the system? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3324.71s">And</a>  was there a cost associated with that, like a spectrum? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3328.538s">Option</a>  A, $5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3330.001s">Option</a>  B, $15 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3331.564s">Option</a>  C is what we have here, which is what, $25 million?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3336.847s">My</a>  understanding is a feasibility study was conducted, and I'll leave the specifics to Dr. Cushing.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3342.409s">So</a>  we recently had an infrared scan. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3344.85s">We</a>  first had a visual inspection of the McGlynn roof completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3348.371s">We</a>  then had an infrared scan. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3350.431s">The</a>  visual inspection by our roofing contractor who does this work felt that the roof was probably 10% wet, as it's termed. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3360.414s">The</a>  infrared scan revealed 25% wetness. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3364.215s">So</a>  the roof needs significant work as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3367.397s">As</a>  part of this project, we examined the costs associated with a full roof replacement, which under the 2011 building code standards would increase the level of insulation. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3378.263s">We</a>  then had Brenda Pike crunch the numbers on that to see what the cost savings over the 20 year life of the roof would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3386.207s">And</a>  it pales in comparison to the cost of a replacement. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3389.289s">What</a>  we can do is a refurbishment, a treatment, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3393.091s">Similar</a>  to what director hunt led about five years ago now, four years ago now at the Andrews Middle School which is called a white knight application, which they go in they repair the wet spots they repair any damage to the roof, and then they put essentially for lack of a better term, a film heavily durable film that has a 20 year warranty on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3414.575s">So</a>  that's what we will more than likely do at the McGlynn at 50% the cost same warranty same lifespan 50% the cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3423.037s">So,</a>  to answer that question on the roof. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3426.358s">Also,</a>  to speak directly to your question around, you know, could these units be repaired. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3432.02s">Unfortunately,</a>  no. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3434.061s">The</a>  Environmental Protection Agency has banned the manufacture and importation of the refrigerant that powers these units. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3444.051s">The</a>  refrigerant that powers these units is R22 refrigerant. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3448.035s">It</a>  was banned about <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3450.506s">Four</a>  and a half years ago at this point, sorry, I used to be a real academic person and help lift schools out of turnaround. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3457.929s">I</a>  now know HVAC and other systems which it's just part of what school systems do. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3463.472s">So</a>  R22 was banned, I think it was during 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3466.973s">We</a>  did significant work on the Roberts, the Misatoch, and the Brooks in the summer of 2019 to replace a significant amount of compressors. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3476.902s">That</a>  was funded by a free cash award just prior to my arrival in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3482.907s">These</a>  systems operating on R22 would be cost prohibitive <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3488.132s">All</a>  right, the only way to get R-22 is to reclaim it from other units that are being decommissioned or from existing stores. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3498.061s">The</a>  costs associated with that are exorbitant. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3501.704s">I</a>  have actually the numbers in a previous school committee report. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3504.327s">They're</a>  just slipping me right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3506.108s">So</a>  to do any type of repair or upgrade on, I'm sorry, any type of repair or retrofit of these units really kicks the can down the road and leads us to maintaining 23-year-old systems that are unfortunately at the end of their lifespan.</p>

    <p>[Nate Merritt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3526.613s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3530.081s">And</a>  to that, that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3531.201s">And</a>  I think, you know, please don't misunderstand. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3533.302s">I</a>  want schools to, right, but just saying form fit replacement versus the solar panels that weren't there, that's an upgrade. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3542.267s">Is</a>  there a dollar cost? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3543.387s">How</a>  many dollars is that, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3545.949s">Are</a>  there other upgrades? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3546.869s">If</a>  they make sense, that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3548.27s">Just</a>  hoping that that cost breakdown for those options has been presented so people can understand the rationale. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3554.693s">And</a>  if it makes sense to buy, buy. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3556.594s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3557.675s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3559.229s">I</a>  will just share that the full feasibility study looks at these sorts of comparisons of various items, but does address the fact that a retrofit is just not possible, really, at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3570.776s">An</a>  interesting thing with the solar is that we are putting it forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3575.939s">I</a>  am recommending it as an ad alternate on this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3579.021s">And</a>  that is actually because what I have done when we've worked on the last several construction projects, the police, the library, et cetera, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3585.525s">When</a>  solar is an ad alternate, it comes in at a much lower price than if it was a standalone project, and it comes in surprisingly low, typically because the electrical sub doesn't want to lose the work, and so they give a really good price on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3599.394s">So</a>  we will put it forward as an ad alternate. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3601.316s">If</a>  it comes in as too pricey or there's some issue with it, then we'll hold that for a later separately funded project. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3608.18s">If</a>  it comes in at a significantly good price, which is in fact what happened with the police and the library, then we would move forward with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3615.585s">So</a>  I just felt that that was useful to know up front. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3618.126s">But</a>  these are also some of the things that we would get into both in a short committee of the whole, but also in an in-depth one when we are at 100% design.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3627.089s">It</a>  sounds like it's fair to say that maximizing the lifespan, minimizing the cost, and maximizing the efficiency of this project has been the touchstone of the feasibility study and the design process. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3639.013s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3640.512s">I'd</a>  also like to say that through our meeting since August, we've had to make serious decisions about this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3648.473s">And</a>  the two things guiding our work are energy efficiency, all right, and making sure that we're helping Medford meet its climate goals, but also fiscal responsibility to the taxpayers of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3661.496s">We've</a>  made conscientious decisions on this project for these two schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3668.357s">that</a>  are fiscally responsible and, you know, sacrifice quicker delivery in some cases and extend the timeline a little bit because of the extraordinarily high cost for that quicker delivery of certain units.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3686.456s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3687.957s">Seeing</a>  no hands on Zoom, we'll go to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3689.699s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3690.74s">You</a>  have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Vienneau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3692.389s">Hi,</a>  my name is Lisa Vienneau and I live at 19 Paul Road in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3697.194s">I</a>  was just wondering where this problem has existed for a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3700.898s">How</a>  extensively or creatively have you looked for resources on the <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3706.877s">federal</a>  level, on the private level to fund this or to help fund this project so that it doesn't always just lean on the taxpayer to have to pay it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3717.663s">Just</a>  curious where it's been around for at least five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3721.385s">You've</a>  had time to think, oh, perhaps <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3724.167s">we</a>  should look for funding in other places, not just locally in the city, but maybe federal or private. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3733.795s">I</a>  don't know if construction is considered a way to get funding, but I'm just curious about that.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3741.06s">My</a>  understanding, and I'm sure Dr. Cushing and Director Hunt can add to it, is that federal money has been used up until this point to fund the process up until this point, the federal ARPA money that came to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3752.889s">and</a>  there's not really private grants out there for this kind of project. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3757.193s">And</a>  also I believe it was presented to the school committee that the MSBA was approached and they said that this project wouldn't apply under the MSBA, but.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3764.077s">So</a>  I think that a full robust answer on this, I would like to defer to the committee of the whole, because I would be happy to go on at length about the difficulty with federal funding where we apply for grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3774.685s">I</a>  think it's too much for tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3776.246s">Suffice</a>  it to say, Brendan and I have been looking at that for two and a half years. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3781.65s">The</a>  MSBA is not eligible because we are working on a new school, the new high school, and they said we could not fund this project with MSBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3790.433s">At</a>  the same time, we would have to put the new high school on hold. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3793.654s">Nobody</a>  is willing to put the new high school on hold. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3795.815s">Nobody</a>  is willing to work in a building without air conditioning. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3799.937s">in</a>  buildings that were designed for air conditioning. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3801.879s">So</a>  that's a problem with MSBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3804.341s">We've</a>  looked at smaller grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3806.623s">When</a>  you're looking at a project of this scale, some of the smaller things that are available barely touch this project.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3815.687s">So</a>  the mass MSBA is the Massachusetts School Building Authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3819.188s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3819.908s">And</a>  that's the that's the funding authority that will hopefully fund a large portion of the work that's expected to be done in Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3829.231s">Also,</a>  over the past several years, as everyone is aware, construction costs have spiked excessively. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3838.594s">And</a>  that actually caused several projects in Massachusetts under MSBA authority to either pause their deployment or to refigure their plans into what's called value engineer, eliminate things as the construction moved forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3856.938s">MSBA</a>  also shut down several of their programs over the last several years to make sure that funding was being driven to the core program. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3866.42s">MSBA</a>  is considering and I understand will be reopening some accelerated repair projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3873.383s">That</a>  funding would be for over two years from now, which means another two plus heating seasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3880.906s">And</a>  we're considering those for future work with our other schools that are of similar age. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3888.028s">The</a>  timeline does not fit for these schools where the systems have largely failed.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4023.823s">Wonderful.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4024.763s">Hello,</a>  everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4025.823s">Thank</a>  you for taking this on tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4028.844s">So</a>  this is relatively simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4030.645s">So</a>  we are running out of money that we have set aside for our lead line rebate program. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4037.466s">And</a>  we are trying to actually change that program, how we do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4041.147s">But</a>  we're waiting for some information on a grant that we're trying to get from the EPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4046.485s">So</a>  in the meantime, we need a little bit more money to help that account. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4051.248s">And</a>  that number is 100,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4052.468s">So</a>  we think that'll hold us over until we know more information on how we're either going to continue this program or change it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4061.774s">I'm</a>  happy to answer questions on our plans or whatever comes up.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4065.896s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4066.156s">I'm</a>  going to Vice President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4068.971s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4069.711s">Thank</a>  you, Commissioner McGibbon for being with us this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4072.432s">I</a>  know that the lead line replacement rebate program is something that I've heard a lot about from a lot of constituents. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4078.715s">I</a>  think there's a lot of enthusiasm for this program as homeowners are really happy to know that there are rebates available for replacing lead lines that really ought to be replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4088.138s">So</a>  thank you for your work on that program in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4092.26s">I</a>  think that this is a really worthy program and it makes sense to use monies from the Water and Sewer Stabilization Fund, which, you know, is a way of making sure that our retained earnings can remain useful throughout the year to be put towards this. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4103.488s">And</a>  it sounds to me like it's, you know, essentially just a stopgap, a kind of safety measure until hopefully some federal monies start to augment that program as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4115.396s">So</a>  I would happy to make a motion to approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4117.598s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4306.621s">Thank</a>  you, Council President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4308.022s">Thanks</a>  for allowing this to go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4309.922s">I</a>  think that as we've spoken about in the past, I think that with the passing of the override, I think every dollar that is going to come through the city coffers I'm going to bring forward because of the lack of transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4325.467s">You'll</a>  see that there's a trend tonight as we look at different resolutions that lack of transparency or <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4336.027s">lack</a>  of information for our residents to understand the process as we move forward have been a big issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4343.211s">So</a>  I think that understanding phone calls I received as soon as we get the news that the superintendent's contract has just been bought out, and mutually, by the way, I don't know what that means, but when you have someone for a contract, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4361.022s">so</a>  especially someone that's worked so hard for the community you'd want to see that to the end and i think that not knowing what that that number is that dollar number is and how much these ramifications are going to hit our community i think it's important when you have all these questions about the override and where the money's going where it's truly going and as the mayor said she would have a transparent process i'm just moving this forward to ask that we get a detailed report from the mayor's office <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4388.612s">And,</a>  uh, describing the cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4392.438s">Um</a>  impact that's going to hit this city by paying off a superintendent, um, to go home now and, um. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4403.399s">collective</a>  paycheck to do nothing while we're now moving an assistant superintendent forward an interim role and what that cost will be in the trickle down effect to costs that are going to have to now pick up her slack financially in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4417.024s">So,</a>  um, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4419.005s">This</a>  isn't a secret. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4421.126s">I</a>  hope no one here is offended. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4422.987s">I</a>  told everybody here I will question every single penny moving forward, especially after the override vote and anything that would be a little questionable when it comes to processes that as soon as the override is passed, we settle a buyout for a superintendent to move her out. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4442.676s">So</a>  I think that is going to be super important that we have that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4447.339s">So</a>  I request that from our administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4451.024s">The</a>  second is I'm glad to hear that Mia did respond back to us about our bond rating for Moody's that people didn't know that <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4462.091s">we</a>  were taken off the bond rating by Moody's, one of our investment companies that give us our bond rating because of some technical issues with filing. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4474.78s">I</a>  believe I was told, I'm not sure, but I think that we're here that <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4480.004s">that</a>  is back on, we're back on top and our bond rating has been restored. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4484.468s">It's</a>  also good to know that we truly don't use Moody's too often or if any, when we look at our bonds, but I think it's important that when something goes out, especially when we're talking about what? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4496.759s">financial</a>  mismanagement, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4498.801s">And</a>  what do we hear? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4499.802s">All</a>  of a sudden, Moody's has dropped Medford because of A, B and C. So I appreciate the mayor's response today, letting us know that that has been restored. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4510.692s">But</a>  I would amend this paper, if we could, to ask a report to be presented to the City Council on the reasoning why <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4518.886s">we</a>  would lose a bond rating, because I think that's more alarming in totality to not just getting the bond back. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4527.694s">I</a>  think, yay, we got it back. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4528.855s">But</a>  I think what's important, we talk about the issues we had, especially during the time of the override. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4533.959s">We</a>  talked about mismanagement of our city's finances. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4536.521s">So</a>  I think that we need to see if we can, Mr. President, to amend the paper to ask for that report. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4545.309s">I</a>  would appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4547.951s">Next</a>  is to be resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4549.432s">The</a>  city administration cease and desist the use of private investigators. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4553.515s">I</a>  was told that we have had multiple employees that under contract are being followed by private investigators, and this is getting to be a real problem because what's happening in our community, whether you want to see it or not, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4570.991s">Our</a>  community is being divided in so many different levels, and the administration is the catalyst behind this. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4576.753s">And</a>  we're seeing practices of following hard-working members of our community off of rumors to follow them around the Commonwealth to see if they're doing something wrong during their contractual sick days, and that's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4594.085s">I'm</a>  sure everybody here has said and they fight for unions. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4596.786s">But</a>  if you truly fight for unions, I hope you stand with me to get a true indication of where our tax dollars are going. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4603.508s">Because</a>  if these rumors again, the reason why we hear the mayor is sent out private investigators because of rumors. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4610.73s">And</a>  I as one Councilor, if we're going to play that game, I am now responding to rumors. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4617.321s">that</a>  I want to report back. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4618.983s">If</a>  this is a practice, I need an update and understand the cost that's attributed to these these, um, these private investigators and where what line item they're coming from and <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4633.241s">want</a>  a full report, what this practice, how much it's cost us from the beginning to the end, and if they have found anything dealing with any private investigators. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4642.427s">I</a>  know that, you know, we have one DPW member that's now gone, that has settled for a big number, that's, he's home now, counting his money. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4651.953s">And</a>  I think that was one of the instances that, looking back, I'd love to see what it's cost us. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4657.036s">Again,</a>  I'm gonna bring it forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4660.856s">We</a>  had an override, $500,000 to fix all of our streets and sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4665.538s">Well,</a>  let's see where this money is going. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4667.459s">So</a>  I think this is important that we see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4669.501s">And</a>  last but not least, what I heard the other day, I find it appalling. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4673.182s">And</a>  I think that this is, again, another example of the division of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4680.632s">Everybody</a>  wants that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4681.632s">What</a>  do we have the other day? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4682.993s">We</a>  have DPW members. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4684.914s">We</a>  were commending DPW members because of their hard work and their commitment to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4690.395s">But</a>  in the same breath, we're gonna hear that in this resolution that just the other day, I was informed that I believe 45 DPW members, staff members were brought in to do drug testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4707.742s">And</a>  that's a blatant <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4709.482s">blatant</a>  problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4712.063s">So</a>  my question that I can ask right now is how much did it cost us? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4716.445s">And</a>  what do we find with these these these processes? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4721.287s">Because</a>  I think it's important that we need to know because these members that are here are the people that get up every day and go to work without any question. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4729.711s">Now</a>  they're understaffed. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4731.131s">They're</a>  underpaid. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4733.266s">These</a>  are the people that, remember, we plotted because, what, while everybody was sleeping and doors were shut and everything was buckled down during the pandemic? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4742.389s">Well,</a>  they were fired, there were police, and there were DPW workers that were killing themselves every single day for this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4748.27s">So</a>  I know the mayor talks about the pandemic, and we want to talk about it when it sounds good, but these men and women, what happened last week, that's a serious problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4756.432s">And</a>  for one member of this leadership team in this city, I think that we have to have <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4762.558s">emotion.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4763.079s">We</a>  have to have information that stops this from happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4766.083s">Enough</a>  is enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4768.245s">Our</a>  city is damaged. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4769.767s">Our</a>  state is damaged. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4770.788s">Our</a>  nation is damaged as it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4772.35s">We</a>  don't need any more. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4775.214s">So</a>  I know that there is a representative here from the Teamsters that's represented the union that could explain some important information. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4781.536s">And</a>  I welcome that when it's time, Council President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4784.457s">But</a>  again, I think it's important for this council right now to understand this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4789.158s">And</a>  we all know that, you know, we can't come from the city because of personnel issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4793.319s">But</a>  I will tell you what I can ask for is what the funding what it costs this this community by I believe it was drug testing and alcohol testing, I believe, for <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4805.783s">all</a>  of the city employees that were, by the way, working on our streets, in our schools, in our parks, on our sidewalks, that were called back to the yard, that had to sit in a room and then be embarrassed and disgraced to get drug tested for no reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4825.007s">So</a>  again, Mr. President, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4827.407s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4828.248s">I</a>  have two documents from the administration that I'll read, and then I'll go to members of the council, and then we can go to public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4836.052s">First,</a>  I was on the bond rating we received a message from the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4839.935s">Hello</a>  President Bears and city council members after a great deal of preparation and bond rating call last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4845.098s">I'm</a>  pleased to report that our a three bond rating was reaffirmed by Moody's financial services company upon receiving updated documentation related to our fiscal year 23 audit. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4854.805s">As</a>  you're likely aware the AA3 rating is regarded as a quote high grade rating and per Moody's analysis the city is in line for an elevated credit rating in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4863.788s">You</a>  can read about Moody's outlook on the city's financial health and borrowing strength in a press release on the city website. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4869.469s">While</a>  this is welcome news it comes with opportunities for us to shore up our financial reporting operations and strive to increase our rating in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4876.011s">If</a>  you have any questions please feel free to contact my office. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4880.196s">We</a>  then also received a message regarding Council Resolution <a href="../resolutions/24-518.pdf"><font color="green">24-518</font></a>, which is what we're currently considering. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4887.358s">The</a>  mayor said, hello, President Bears, I wanted to provide some insight on Council Resolution <a href="../resolutions/24-518.pdf"><font color="green">24-518</font></a>. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4891.139s">Quote,</a>  my responsibility as mayor is to the residents and taxpayers of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4896.6s">When</a>  I receive allegations from multiple parties alleging various employee matters, including potential misconduct, fraud, et cetera, I believe our community expects that I investigate these allegations to the fullest extent possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4907.603s">Additionally,</a>  depending on the specific nature of the allegations at issue, our human resources department does not have the bandwidth to undertake investigations that are broad in scope or are too cumbersome that such efforts would impede daily office duties and responsibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4920.705s">Also,</a>  as it relates to school items, please refer all school matters to the school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4925.066s">With</a>  respect to the portion of the proposed resolution pertaining to drug testing, this is a confidential personnel matter and due to individual privacy considerations, we cannot comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4933.487s">If</a>  you have any questions, feel free to contact me. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4937.318s">Brianna</a>  Lugo, current mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4941.88s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4942.48s">Any</a>  and if any other Councilors, please, you know, just signal if you'd like to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4947.123s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4948.103s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4948.603s">So,</a>  Clarity, you're saying the mayor says that so to ask for a a report from the school department, is she is she saying that <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4959.136s">Are</a>  we going to get a report financially so we can understand the ramifications financially for buying out the superintendent? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4966.357s">I</a>  know that you have nothing to do with it, but did she give you any indication? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4969.298s">Because</a>  to me it sounds like, you know, go pound sand. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4972.558s">We're</a>  moving on.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4973.659s">It</a>  says, as it relates to school items, please refer school matters to the school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4977.819s">That's</a>  what the email says. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4979.06s">So</a>  we can send requests to the school.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4981.82s">As</a>  the budgetary stewards of this community that vote on that budget, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4986.753s">I'm</a>  demanding a report, Council President, if you may, to the mayor to break down the financial ramifications of the buyout to the superintendent and what that means to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4998.744s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4999.604s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5000.705s">Any</a>  further questions or comments? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5002.227s">Councilor,</a>  Vice President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5005.253s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5006.134s">I</a>  appreciate the discussion being put forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5008.697s">I</a>  do wish that these topics were separated into disparate resolutions so we could take them up individually and vote on them individually. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5013.862s">A</a>  lot to get into here, but I do just feel that we need to <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5020.569s">be</a>  more clear with the language that we're using. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5022.871s">And</a>  I didn't want people to use, I wouldn't want people to leave the meeting thinking that the city has offered the superintendent a buyout. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5029.977s">That's</a>  not accurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5031.018s">It's</a>  my understanding again, we are not the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5033.3s">I</a>  don't think that we should be taking up matters that are germane to the school committee because that is not our body. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5038.164s">Um,</a>  but it is my understanding that it is pretty common when a superintendent contract is not renewed that the superintendent does step back from the full extent of their responsibilities before their contract is officially over to allow for that transition. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5052.774s">This</a>  isn't abnormal. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5053.814s">It</a>  doesn't indicate that there's any sort of expensive <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5058.314s">illicit,</a>  fraudulent buyout going on, I think that this is normal. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5062.436s">So</a>  I want to put that out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5063.856s">I</a>  wouldn't, you know, I know that sometimes using these words makes for better TV, but I don't think that it's respectful to the residents to mischaracterize what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5073.78s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5079.697s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5079.957s">I</a>  don't want to get the tip of tap, but as the mayor just said in her response, when you hear a rumor, she takes up full responsibility to make sure we know what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5090.043s">As</a>  fiscal stewards of this community, when the city council, when the school committee mutually ends a contract, and yes, there is a bio with it, there is a financial <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5103.647s">a</a>  financial responsibility to the city by the superintendent leaving early. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5108.569s">This</a>  is why I'm asking for the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5110.31s">This</a>  is why I'm asking the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5111.971s">I'm</a>  not asking for anything bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5113.032s">I'm</a>  not saying anybody did anything wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5114.773s">All</a>  I'm asking for is a report so we can see what the financial ramifications are <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5120.655s">by</a>  having this buyout, not just with the superintendent, whatever it costs us, if it costs us anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5125.657s">They</a>  come back and say it costs us nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5127.718s">But</a>  what is it going to cost us for an interim? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5130.88s">What's</a>  that increase? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5132.08s">What</a>  is the trickle-down effect? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5133.281s">Who's</a>  going to take up those responsibilities? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5135.201s">Who's</a>  going to pay those people? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5137.042s">Are</a>  they going to get paid? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5138.263s">So</a>  I don't think this is something that's very confusing. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5141.344s">This,</a>  believe me, this is pretty clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5144.866s">So</a>  when I asked for a resolution, the resolution doesn't seem to be too dumbfounding, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5149.568s">I</a>  think it's pretty self-explanatory. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5151.389s">All</a>  this council is asking for, ladies and gentlemen, is just a report on the breakdown of the mutual buyout or the mutual dismissal of the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5161.093s">That's</a>  all. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5165.225s">I'm</a>  not trying to make this more than it is.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5166.486s">I'll</a>  go to Councilor Tseng and Councilor Callaghan. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5170.709s">Councilor</a>  Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5172.911s">I</a>  believe Councilor Callaghan. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5175.153s">Sorry,</a>  I didn't see the order.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5176.213s">Councilor</a>  Callaghan.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5177.962s">I</a>  actually would make a motion to sever. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5179.903s">I</a>  would sever it into five. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5181.203s">Perhaps</a>  we can do that after public discussion or whatever before or after either one is fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5186.504s">But</a>  I think there's one that's about the essentially lines two and four, which are the cost of terminating. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5194.246s">Then</a>  the one in the middle, that line three, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5198.207s">Uh</a>  inviting all communications. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5199.708s">I</a>  think that's a a separate one. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5202.209s">Um</a>  there's a question of the bond rating is a third. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5205.651s">The</a>  question of the private investigators is the fourth and the question of the drug testing is a fifth. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5210.313s">That</a>  would be my suggestion to sever it into those five.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5213.255s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5213.555s">Yeah,</a>  we can take that up when we move to the voting if that's okay so we can hear just since it was presented as one, I think it's fair to hear it as one.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5222.557s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5224.44s">I</a>  believe that what is more confusing to me, and I believe I'll... <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5229.304s">is</a>  also confusing to people at home, is using the word buyout for something that I assume is quite contractual. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5236.167s">If</a>  the criticism, and I understand Councilor Scarpelli is not saying that anyone has necessarily done anything wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5244.79s">And,</a>  you know, it's always good to have more information, but I do, I think the word is what is confusing, but not the resolution itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5255.638s">When</a>  it comes to the topic of the school superintendent I think it's really important to preface anything by saying that there is a clear separation of powers in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5264.726s">When</a>  it comes to school governance. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5266.788s">However,</a>  I understand where the Councilors coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5270.971s">I</a>  just, I worry that we slip into a logical situation where, you know, this is the standard procedure right, the school board the school committee chooses not to renew something, the contract with the superintendent, and there's a transition period. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5287.548s">This</a>  is also from my understanding very standard. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5290.952s">Now,</a>  if we, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5293.599s">If</a>  the school committee, and that's up to their discretion, doesn't want to renew a contract with the superintendent, this is the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5300.585s">There</a>  isn't any other way that we could do it that would cost less. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5305.49s">And</a>  if there then becomes criticism that this is how it was done, then we foreclose any accountability we have over a hypothetical superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5315.138s">So</a>  that's that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5316.7s">And</a>  I haven't decided. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5320.103s">I</a>  think that's just my logical qualm with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5323.685s">But</a>  I understand the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5325.506s">I</a>  understand that it wasn't meant poorly. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5329.668s">With</a>  regards to, and I'll be brief about everything else because I understand there are folks in the audience who want to talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5337.513s">I</a>  do think it's important that in the administration of the city and how we carry out our duties, I understand the need for accountability. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5346.398s">I</a>  also understand that we, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5349.848s">we</a>  have a responsibility to the dignity of our workers as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5354.091s">I'll</a>  keep it simple in that, at that, because I know there are a lot of people here who are looking to give us more information to speak as well.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5365.459s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5365.86s">Any</a>  further comment by members of the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5367.961s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5370.223s">I</a>  just think that, I think I'll say it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5372.725s">And</a>  I, and I, for what this community has just gone through in November, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5378.331s">I</a>  think it's important that we do question everything because everybody's asking. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5384.873s">So</a>  either it's on the city side, school side, it comes, it's coming out of our city's budget and there are questions that aren't being asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5393.537s">So</a>  when residents come to me and say, what are the implications financially, especially after an override, it just doesn't smell right. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5401.199s">That's</a>  why I'm saying these are the, these are the important things that all that is, is just, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5405.968s">showing</a>  the information, understanding the information moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5409.49s">So</a>  when we talk about accountability, don't you think it's about time that the mayor is held accountable? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5414.953s">I</a>  mean, don't we think that this administration is held accountable? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5419.696s">This</a>  is the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5421.857s">So</a>  she's getting a free pass by hiding behind different levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5427.28s">And</a>  the bottom line is enough is enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5429.942s">We</a>  need to fix this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5431.643s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Campbell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5460.575s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5462.035s">My</a>  name is Nancy Campbell, 544 Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5465.416s">I'm</a>  a field representative with the Teamsters Local 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5469.177s">I'm</a>  one of three agents assigned to represent the City of Medford Union employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5475.518s">We're</a>  here today because this past week, the mayor singled out our DPW workers, violating their rights, and broke the law again. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5484.71s">This</a>  time the mayor demanded that 28 of our DPW members, almost the entire bargaining unit, take a mandatory drug test. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5493.053s">The</a>  28 DPW members were lined up outside in broad daylight for all the world to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5499.395s">One</a>  by one, they were loaded into the back of a drug testing van like criminals. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5504.844s">They</a>  were forced to sign away their rights, a violation of mass DOT regulations, and then they were told to pee in a cup with a stranger peering over their shoulder. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5515.408s">The</a>  stranger took each test in rapid succession with so much as non-sanitizing his hands between each. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5526.592s">This</a>  sort of mass drug testing is unheard of. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5530.473s">It</a>  was humiliating, inhumane, and illegal. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5535.359s">To</a>  be clear, there was absolutely no just cause or reasonable suspicion for any of these members to be tested, let alone all 28 of them at once. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5546.243s">By</a>  the mayor's own account, a single unused needle found in the bathroom on Monday morning justified the mass testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5556.667s">But</a>  let's call a spade a spade here. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5559.048s">The</a>  bathroom where the needle was found <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5561.946s">wasn't</a>  only used by DPW workers. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5566.228s">It</a>  was used by the public and other city employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5569.87s">So</a>  why then were only DPW workers singled out? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5574.913s">I'm</a>  sure the mayor will be scrambling around to come up with a good answer for that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5580.155s">The</a>  mayor's despicable actions last week demonstrated poor leadership, bad judgment, and a failed labor relation policy that has become typical for her administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5592.517s">but</a>  that serves absolutely no one but the management attorneys who line their pockets with taxpayer dollars defending the mayor's unlawful actions. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5604.022s">In</a>  one fell swoop, the mayor managed to violate the collective bargaining agreement, state labor law, DOT regulations, the city's own drug policy, and most importantly, the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5617.427s">Constitution.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5619.128s">The</a>  Fourth Amendment protects all citizens from unreasonable government search and seizure. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5625.211s">If</a>  a police officer wants to give somebody a breathalyzer to see whether they have been drinking and driving, they need probable cause, reasonable suspicion. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5635.617s">They</a>  can't just shove a tube down their throat because they feel like it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5639.8s">And</a>  they certainly can't start pulling over random passerby after finding a single beer can on the side of the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5648.277s">Yet</a>  here in MedFed, that effectively is exactly what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5652.68s">Without</a>  reasonable bias whatsoever, upon finding a single unused needle in a public bathroom, the mayor subjected 28 city employees to drug tests. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5664.528s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5665.528s">Because</a>  she felt like it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5668.439s">She</a>  did not have any reason or evidence to suspect that any of the needles belonging to any one of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5674.983s">So</a>  it should come as no surprise that the drug test results show that every single tested employee passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5684.149s">Again,</a>  I wanna be clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5686.231s">Every</a>  single employee who was tested passed not only a drug test, but also a breathalyzer. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5692.995s">Not</a>  one of our members showed up to work <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5695.877s">under</a>  the influence of drug or alcohol. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5698.86s">Here</a>  in Medford, you have a mayor who thinks she is above the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5702.262s">You</a>  have a mayor who thinks the US Constitution means absolutely nothing.</p>

    <p>[Campbell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5708.325s">The</a>  mayor, an attorney by trade, feels as though these employees, citizens of Medford, should not be afforded the same rights as all Americans. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5717.188s">But</a>  to our members, who were the ones subjected to the embarrassment of being forced to take these invasive tests against their will or lose their job in the face of embarrassment of residents thinking that these hardworking men <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5733.234s">dedicated</a>  in keeping your city street running safely are using drugs at work. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5738.438s">Under</a>  the mayor's tenure, the city has already spent hundreds of thousands of dollars fighting unions across the city rather than giving them fair wage adjustment and benefits. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5748.604s">The</a>  message is clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5749.905s">The</a>  mayor would rather spend your money fighting her employees than supporting them. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5754.829s">The</a>  council spends time talking about the council, the mayor, the school committee raises, but no one <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5761.593s">No</a>  one discusses the regular employees like police, fire, dispatchers, Teamster employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5767.037s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5768.077s">She</a>  got three raises this year, but she doesn't think they deserve one.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5773.061s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5773.481s">That's</a>  time. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5774.101s">And</a>  we went two minutes over.</p>

    <p>[Campbell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5775.362s">Lastly,</a>  we are calling on the mayor.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5779.407s">I'll</a>  let her finish her sentence, but I just want you to acknowledge the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5782.731s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Campbell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5783.111s">Finish</a>  the sentence. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5784.332s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5784.572s">I'd</a>  like to finish. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5786.334s">Excuse</a>  me. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5789.237s">The</a>  city has paid another many hundreds of thousands of dollars to employees throughout the city for mass wage violations, as well as employment lawsuits. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5801.147s">What</a>  are you doing as city councils waiting for? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5804.849s">Are</a>  you waiting for additional civil rights lawsuits like the one that was just filed today or more wage violations so the city finally goes into bankruptcy? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5814.409s">Because</a>  I can assure you that is exactly the direction you're headed in. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5818.291s">You</a>  have asked the residents of this great city for overrides under the guise of keeping their schools properly staffed, but also while paying for her constant and deliberate mishandling of their money for attorney fees lawsuit settlement and wage violations. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5835.541s">If</a>  the city was being properly managed by a competent mayor, instead of a mayor playing favoritism and using city funds to finance her personal vendettas against her employees, you wouldn't need any overrides. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5848.913s">When</a>  will you start doing your jobs that you were elected to do and protect the resident and employees from this constant harassment and mistreatment from the mayor? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5858.641s">I</a>  urge all of you to take a step back and reassess if you're really stepping up to the plate and doing the very best you can as elected city councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5868.724s">I</a>  wanna urge the residents here in Medford to start doing the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5872.405s">Is</a>  the mayor doing the job you elected her to do by wasting your hard earned money on attorney fees, private investigators, unlawful drug testing to settle personal scores of the employees? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5884.329s">Wake</a>  up everybody and start paying attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5887.99s">and</a>  put a stop to this once and for all because we will not stop fighting to protect our members, their rights, their jobs and their dignities. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5896.438s">Lastly,</a>  we are calling on the mayor to take a urine drug test in the front parking lot of the DPW in an unsanitary van. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5906.874s">with</a>  the door wide open, with a line of people outside watching, which is exactly the humiliating conditions our members, your hardworking DPW employees, were mandated to in the last test on Monday, as a condition of their employment, by the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5925.445s">And</a>  if she refuses, she should face the same repercussions they were threatened with. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5931.608s">She</a>  should be fired.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5934.599s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5935.039s">I</a>  just want to acknowledge, I know you were speaking for a number of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5938.202s">We</a>  do have rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5939.002s">I</a>  did extensively go beyond those rules to hear the comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5942.064s">That's</a>  going to be the one time that I do that tonight on this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5944.686s">If</a>  there are other people who would like to speak, there'll be a three minute time limit.</p>

experience that they felt very uncomfortable and felt was unjust. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6303.584s">We've</a>  heard that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6304.645s">We</a>  have a short response from the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6307.429s">I'm</a>  going to guess that most of the people behind this rail would like to learn more about what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6312.252s">And</a>  also just to be honest and direct, our role in this process is we do not, I am not the boss of any employee in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6319.617s">No</a>  one behind this rail is the manager of any employee in the city, except for this person right next to us is the only person in the city who works for the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6327.562s">Everybody</a>  else who works for the city of Medford works for the mayor of Medford or the superintendent of schools of the Medford public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6334.927s">So</a>  that's the role that we play here. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6338.01s">I'm</a>  sure many of us would feel dismayed and feel that the experience that was described by the representative was not something that they would want to go through. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6345.578s">I</a>  think everyone in the crowd would probably say the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6349.022s">Now</a>  the rest of the facts that come out of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6351.724s">We</a>  don't know all the answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6352.985s">We</a>  just have what has been presented so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6355.908s">And</a>  our action simply would be to say, we do not like that you did that mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6360.452s">When</a>  we talk about accountability for the mayor, that happens at the ballot box every two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6365.376s">And</a>  that is how she's held accountable. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6368.959s">Beyond</a>  that, there is nothing in the city charter, the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, federal law that empowers this council to order the mayor to not do what she did. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6378.992s">The</a>  union has filed a suit, as is their right, on behalf of their members, disputing what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6386.218s">Individuals</a>  filed the suit. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6387.339s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6387.679s">Then</a>  the individuals filed the suit themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6389.501s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6389.841s">And</a>  the representative presented it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6391.822s">I</a>  assumed that Teamsters Local 25 represented, but the members have filed suit. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6396.026s">That's</a>  their right. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6397.146s">Beyond</a>  that, their recourse is we can hear facts here. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6399.889s">We</a>  can hear statements made here. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6401.63s">People</a>  can speak at the podium and the Councilors can look for additional information, but that's why we're having the discussion that we're having. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6410.277s">And</a>  no one behind the rail is obligated at this point to say, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6413.672s">their</a>  opinion, whether they feel like they have enough information to make an informed discussion, all I can say is that the experience that was described is not something I would want to experience, and I'm sure we all would like to find out more information about why it happened and to make sure that whatever recourse is available to the people who experienced it is there. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6433.726s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6434.226s">And</a>  one of the reasons that we have rules is so that we maintain decorum and that I can explain the process and what this council has the power to do and not do. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6443.249s">So</a>  I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6445.969s">I'll</a>  go to Zoom and then we'll come back to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6449.07s">On</a>  Zoom, we have Nadeen. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6450.411s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6451.831s">You</a>  have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Nadeen Moretti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6461.754s">Hi,</a>  can you hear me? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6464.991s">Oh,</a>  hello?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6468.574s">Nadeen,</a>  we can hear you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6469.455s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Nadeen Moretti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6471.176s">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6471.897s">Thank</a>  you, Nadeen Moretti, Birgit Av. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6473.418s">I</a>  just want to say something brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6476.941s">Of</a>  course, what's going on is just disgusting, and it just seems to always compound with every week, every meeting, every issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6487.83s">What</a>  I do want to point out, though, the level of maturity that is missing <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6493.317s">oftentimes</a>  from the response with people that are behind the podium or that come up to the podium to speak, it's just, it's unthinkable. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6500.484s">I</a>  just can't get over the response sometimes, the laughing, you know, not from every single council member, but I just don't think it's appropriate when you have people that have deep, real feelings what's going on and people are upset and we're constantly upset coming to this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6516.66s">That's</a>  all we ever are. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6519.455s">I</a>  just don't think it's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6520.516s">I</a>  think it's very unbecoming of what a council, I'm not talking about everybody, I'm talking about one person right now, should act. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6526.658s">And</a>  I just think that you really have to dial it down because it's just not appropriate to laugh at people who are coming up with deep-rooted feelings of the stuff that's going on, which is not right by the mayor and most of the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6541.485s">So</a>  I just wanna make a point of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6542.825s">I</a>  think that you really need to, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6545.538s">think</a>  before you laugh or think before you speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6548.721s">You</a>  know, there has to be a level of maturity that is just unfound. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6552.604s">So</a>  thank you for your time.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6556.527s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6557.048s">Um,</a>  we'll go to the podium, name and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6559.65s">Mr.</a>  Castagnetti, you have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6564.154s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6565.415s">Uh,</a>  I, I'm very confused and <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6569.565s">It's</a>  sad to hear this. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6571.086s">It's</a>  a new method happening, I guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6573.749s">I</a>  never heard of this before. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6574.87s">But</a>  I just have one question for, I believe, for a Councilor, and hopefully that Councilor can respond this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6584.418s">Did</a>  I hear a Councilor say that a needle was found in the bathroom in the City Hall premises?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6595.567s">I</a>  believe the representative from Local 25 said that a needle was found, an unused needle was found in the bathroom at the DPW facility.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6603.271s">I</a>  see. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6605.653s">OK,</a>  could that have been a false flag? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6608.746s">could</a>  have been planted by anyone and could that happen again and do emergency testing all over again in the future if that's the case?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6616.151s">I</a>  do not have information. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6618.032s">I</a>  mean, I don't have that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6619.273s">Um,</a>  all I have is the statement that we received from the mayor, their resolution by the Councilor and what we've heard at the podium.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6624.736s">Do</a>  you know the location?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6627.078s">I</a>  was, I've heard from the representative that it was at, uh, the DPW bathroom.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6633.322s">Where's</a>  that located?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6634.543s">At</a>  James street.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6635.543s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6636.144s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6641.431s">Name</a>  and address for the record please. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6642.372s">You</a>  have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Lori Spinney-Flagg]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6643.292s">Lori</a>  55 Garfield Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6645.874s">I</a>  just want to make a point. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6648.115s">I</a>  didn't even know this had happened and I think it's disgusting for a star but more disgusting was just three months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6658.322s">We</a>  as the residents on Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6661.843s">were</a>  picketing and fighting a methadone dispensary being put on Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6669.735s">And</a>  the mayor now finds that she has the authority to go after employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6676.823s">because</a>  a needle was found? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6678.644s">Does</a>  she even start to think of how many needles would be lining Salem Street if that dispensary had been approved there, which I understand is still on the table somewhere along the authority's ruling to put somewhere else in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6697.829s">Just</a>  wanted to point that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6699.47s">It's</a>  kind of, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6701.892s">You</a>  can put a dispensary in, but now you're going after your employees because a needle was found? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6709.82s">I</a>  don't understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6711.281s">Dispensaries</a>  are okay, needles are okay there, but. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6715.353s">I</a>  mean, I don't think needles anywhere in the city are good, but it's kind of funny that the mayor would go and go after her employees for a needle that they don't even know where it came from. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6727.939s">It</a>  was said earlier, it's not just DPW, it's a public bathroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6733.461s">I</a>  mean, just doesn't make a lot of sense, the management of this city these days. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6738.944s">And</a>  if you guys don't understand, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6741.923s">that</a>  the residents are not happy with what you're putting forward these days. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6748.327s">And</a>  maybe you should start listening to some of the residents because two years is coming soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6756.672s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6759.393s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6759.854s">Any</a>  further comment by members of the public? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6765.877s">Name</a>  and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6766.818s">You</a>  have three minutes, Nate, and I'll wait till you get to the phone.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6802.719s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Martin. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6803.38s">In</a>  terms of the specifics, I mean, it sounds like this is going to be litigated and evidence will be presented on that litigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6811.746s">Any</a>  further public comments? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6815.489s">Seeing</a>  none, I will go to Councilor Callahan and then Councilor Scarpelli and then Councilor Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6821.153s">Councilor</a>  Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6825.176s">Oops,</a>  sorry.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6828.433s">comment</a>  was actually from earlier just to explain. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6831.915s">To</a>  the person who's asking us to respond that like actually, I think I at least for one Councilor was really hoping to hear from the public first. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6839.539s">I</a>  did not want to interrupt and put in my own comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6842.441s">I</a>  really wanted to hear a little bit more about what people had gone through and experienced. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6846.703s">That</a>  was why I was not responding to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6849.264s">I</a>  also do hope that we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6853.386s">Are</a>  we going to sever before we discuss each one or are we going to sever at the very last second? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6858.968s">I</a>  think it might be easier to sever and then discuss each piece.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6862.089s">I'm</a>  just going to take the discussion that's on the table and then we can take any motions. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6872.113s">Go</a>  to Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6874.434s">If</a>  I can, Mr. President, I think that if I can have the representative from local 25 <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6882.133s">And</a>  I think that part of this process, I think that there was a clear trend in meaning behind my resolutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6891.92s">And</a>  I know it was something that's horrible and it's something that would be vetted out properly in the courts. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6900.825s">But</a>  I think that what was clear is making sure that our community understood a few things. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6908.365s">is</a>  one, we get a report that breaks down the funding mechanism and how money's being spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6914.989s">That's</a>  the first thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6916.71s">The</a>  second thing is that understanding the process that our leadership in this community in the mayor's office is lacking and it's causing a huge divide in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6927.335s">I</a>  mean, we've talked about the police today, 900 days without a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6931.618s">We're</a>  talking about the firefighters having some serious issues right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6936.184s">Um,</a>  and then right. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6937.864s">And</a>  what we're talking about right now is what I need to know is how much just this one is an issue cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6945.166s">And</a>  then you brought up a good point, Mr. Hatch. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6946.887s">You</a>  said that, you know, how many communities do you work with? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6950.228s">If</a>  you can, can you, what, what are they? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6952.468s">If</a>  you can, do you know what, what communities...</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6978.452s">Okay,</a>  I think that the question I need to ask you, you've obviously represented those communities and you've had leaders in those communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6988.703s">Is</a>  it an anomaly? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6990.324s">Is</a>  this a trend that we're seeing just because we're in Medford, we're isolated? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6993.707s">I</a>  know by working in a municipality for the last 18 years, I see the difference, but most people don't understand that some people actually come to the city of Medford say, this is the norm. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7005.438s">This</a>  is what a mayor is supposed to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7007.475s">can</a>  you just shed just a little light on your experience and your other communities? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7013.88s">Do</a>  you see the same trends and do you see the same financial impact to their communities that we're seeing here in Medford?</p>

    <p>[Campbell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7019.804s">Well,</a>  I can tell you that me specifically, I worked for over 23 years in a municipality, in several, Concord and more recently for a while in Cambridge, one of the biggest cities in the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7035.951s">And</a>  now I represent all of these cities here with Local 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7040.773s">And</a>  I can honestly tell you Medford is hands down the worst city to work with. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7047.816s">I</a>  can call any other community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7049.557s">I</a>  can call a city manager, a mayor, a town manager, no matter what, and ask a question, get an answer, work together, get our contracts done in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7061.707s">For</a>  somebody to violate somebody's constitutional rights, we've never seen it in Local 25, that any of us have been here. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7068.91s">Some</a>  of us have been here over 25 years, fighting for these cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7072.892s">It</a>  has absolutely never happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7074.353s">Our</a>  attorneys are in awe that this just happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7078.135s">We</a>  don't see it anywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7080.136s">It's</a>  wasteful spending, and it's like nobody has control here.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7083.897s">OK,</a>  so that's my final question is this, because this is what the point is. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7088.168s">The</a>  amount of money we spent on drug testing and breathalyzers for these employees is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7094.15s">I</a>  wanna see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7096.191s">But</a>  I would love to see the cost that to the Teamsters, because we're not getting the true indication of what the city is paying for our attorneys, because we don't have a city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7105.635s">So</a>  I would like, if you can, if you could report back to the council and just give us an idea of what the Teamsters pay, their council, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7114.924s">and</a>  fighting method issues, because that will at least give us a true indication that in the last five and a half years, we've seen that the teams have paid X amount of dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7126.333s">And</a>  from what I gather, it should be pretty equivalent to see where our money is going. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7131.296s">Again,</a>  I'm bringing this forward to the community so we can understand a major impact to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7137.281s">And</a>  I bring up the override every time because we talk about mismanagement of funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7142.569s">And</a>  when we have the representatives of 14 other communities, and we hear that this doesn't happen anywhere else, that's a red flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7151.476s">So</a>  again, I know what was happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7153.798s">We</a>  don't like it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7155.6s">We</a>  stand against it 1,000% as human beings. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7158.762s">But</a>  truly, the intent for this resolution is really to understand, A, the financial impact that we're seeing in all of my other resolutions I put in place, and then B, again, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7171.696s">the</a>  lack of true transparency and true leadership with the mayor of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7177.638s">So</a>  again, I thank you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7179.579s">Again,</a>  I apologize that things are getting heated again, but I know it's something that's very emotional. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7186.262s">I</a>  talked to at least 10 DPW workers that call me directly that I've grown up with, I've been friends with, that were absolutely appalled and embarrassed. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7194.585s">Their</a>  wives called me and said, this is a disgrace. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7197.647s">What</a>  my husband had to endure today was a disgrace. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7201.776s">And</a>  I can't speak to that more than I can, or I wish I could because I would have called the city solicitor and asked him how far I can go with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7210.04s">But</a>  I know that you have put forth the civil rights lawsuit, I believe against the mayor and against the city, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7217.604s">So</a>  that's going to be interesting to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7219.585s">And</a>  again, another financial impact to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7223.727s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Campbell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7231.609s">plus,</a>  just to our members, aside from other unions. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7234.711s">But</a>  we'll be more than happy to get you that information.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7236.752s">That'll</a>  be interesting, because I know that this administration, what they love to do is they like to come back and say, oh, in Everett, they pay this much, and in Malden, they pay this much. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7246.276s">What</a>  I'd like to see is what you pay out to fight issues legally with Everett, with Melrose, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7255.699s">Chelsea</a>  with Cambridge, just to get a true indication how poorly mismanaged this community is when it comes to fiscal transparency.</p>

    <p>[Campbell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7263.001s">Just</a>  a quick side note on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7264.441s">A</a>  lot of those cities, so you know, have city solicitors on the payroll. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7268.442s">The</a>  city of Medford doesn't, so he works by hour, but he's more controllable than a city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7276.004s">So</a>  we'll get you all that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7278.545s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7279.005s">I</a>  would just note that we have received <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7283.001s">dozens</a>  of warrant articles, multiple reports about the legal costs paid out by the city, from the city administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7289.225s">It's</a>  public documents. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7291.506s">We</a>  can provide them. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7292.447s">They're</a>  sent to us by email on a monthly basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7294.588s">The</a>  administration can provide them. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7297.13s">And</a>  the city has never spent more than the budgeted amount for the law department, budgeted in our fiscal year budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7306.616s">there</a>  has been no additional spending or major financial impact on the city beyond the legal budget that is budgeted every year through the fiscal year budget process and that is proven out by the financial documents.</p>

    <p>[Campbell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7316.739s">I</a>  think all of our legal payouts should be accounted for. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7319.54s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7319.94s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7320.5s">All</a>  the settlements. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7321.08s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7322.701s">I'm</a>  speaking right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7323.581s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7328.86s">Any</a>  further comments from members of council? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7330.221s">I'm</a>  going to go to Councilor Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7333.082s">I'm</a>  going to go to Councilor Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7334.723s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7335.484s">Councilor</a>  Leming.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7338.585s">Yes,</a>  thank you, Council President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7340.887s">So</a>  I didn't do this earlier because I wanted to hear what the folks from the DBW in the room had to say during public comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7351.953s">And</a>  it is a point that I have a lot of sympathy with considering that I work a job where I get <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7358.426s">uh,</a>  urinalysis testing in front of my colleagues at least three times a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7362.668s">So,</a>  um, but there are, there are, uh, other issues with this resolution that I have mainly OML considerations, which has been discussed in this council before. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7374.173s">And</a>  I want more information about the private investigator issue, uh, as well as, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7382.998s">the</a>  fact that I'm not sure about the city council stepping into strictly school committee issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7388.843s">So</a>  I'm going to go and invoke rule 21 on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7390.845s">We</a>  can move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7392.266s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7394.708s">Councilor</a>  Leming has invoked rule 21. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7396.73s">I</a>  think we have a number of financial items. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7405.097s">We</a>  talked about, we talked about <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7408.786s">Hold</a>  on a minute, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7409.547s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7410.147s">Cost</a>  associated with terminating the school and superintendent's contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7414.21s">Finance</a>  director appeared articulate dropping bond rating. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7418.993s">Utilization</a>  of a complete financial report. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7420.874s">I</a>  mean, there's multiple financial items in this paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7427.495s">I'll</a>  read the rule.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7428.675s">It's</a>  talking about when we talk about when you're voting on funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7433.557s">This</a>  isn't a financial paper voting on funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7436.538s">This</a>  is a resolution asking for financial documents that are spent by the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7441.5s">We're</a>  not asking for spending money. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7443.101s">That's</a>  a negative way to get out of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7446.982s">And</a>  I tell you, I'm embarrassed that that just happened.</p>
