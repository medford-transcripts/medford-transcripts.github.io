[SPEAKER_24]: I just wanna thank my colleagues for an incredible 2024.

11
00:11:08,452 --> 00:11:16,374
[SPEAKER_24]: It's been a busy year of nearly a hundred meetings of this body and committee and in regular session.

12
00:11:17,194 --> 00:11:22,615
[SPEAKER_24]: And I don't think anyone can say that this council has not been outspoken and spoken its mind on a variety of topics.

13
00:11:23,888 --> 00:11:29,033
[SPEAKER_24]: In January, I spoke about three leadership principles, collaboration, planning, and trust.

14
00:11:29,973 --> 00:11:49,010
[SPEAKER_24]: This council has worked together collaboratively within our committees with the city administration, city staff, community organizations, businesses, educational institutions, and thousands of residents to implement and discuss a clear and transparent governing agenda created and published in February.

15
00:11:50,117 --> 00:11:57,980
[SPEAKER_24]: Tomorrow night we're going to conduct our one year review of that plan and suggest updates for the year ahead and I encourage everyone in our city to join us.

16
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:09,424
[SPEAKER_24]: I firmly believe that this open and direct approach to governance is foundational to good governance and to trust, and I'm going to continue to lead with these principles in 2025.

17
00:12:10,365 --> 00:12:13,266
[SPEAKER_24]: There's always disagreement, and we've had some tough meetings.

18
00:12:14,761 --> 00:12:21,325
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm always open to meet with anyone, whether that's Councilors, residents, employees of the city and others to hear from them.

19
00:12:21,665 --> 00:12:26,248
[SPEAKER_24]: And of course, this council will always hear from anyone who speaks at this podium under our rules.

20
00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:29,270
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm excited for 2025.

21
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:33,832
[SPEAKER_24]: Earlier this week, released our January to June schedule.

22
00:12:33,872 --> 00:12:41,357
[SPEAKER_24]: There are 60 meetings scheduled on topics including the budget, a new city charter, zoning and much more.

23
00:12:42,284 --> 00:12:48,676
[SPEAKER_24]: And I really just want to implore and invite the community to join us in the process of building a better Medford together.

24
00:12:48,776 --> 00:12:50,339
[SPEAKER_24]: So thank you for your indulgence.

25
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:52,183
[SPEAKER_24]: And with that, we'll move to the agenda.

26
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,283
[SPEAKER_24]: Announcements, accolades, remembrances, reports, and records.

27
00:12:58,303 --> 00:13:01,425
[SPEAKER_24]: 24-512 offered by Councilor Scarpelli.

28
00:13:01,946 --> 00:13:09,612
[SPEAKER_24]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council commend and congratulate Barbara Kerr for her 40 years of tireless and selfless service at the Medford Public Library.

29
00:13:10,072 --> 00:13:14,536
[SPEAKER_24]: We thank her for her work with our residents and for providing a welcoming hub for our community.

30
00:13:15,236 --> 00:13:16,097
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Scarpelli.

31
00:13:16,956 --> 00:13:18,257
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

32
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:24,323
[SPEAKER_29]: And when you talk about, imagine doing anything for 40 years, how impressive that is.

33
00:13:24,343 --> 00:13:28,026
[SPEAKER_29]: And what Barbara has endured for 40 years at

34
00:13:30,506 --> 00:13:56,095
[SPEAKER_29]: The beginning is a library, it's running a library and then a subpar library, then a failing library with ceilings caving in and then going through the process of a new library and maintaining an opportunity in pilot libraries across the city and working together with former City Council President Caraviello to bring to fruition a new library in Medford.

35
00:13:58,116 --> 00:14:09,990
[SPEAKER_29]: a cornerstone now, a great piece of our Medford Square entrance, and to see what Barbara has given to our community, something needs to be commended.

36
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:13,975
[SPEAKER_29]: If I can, if I could, I would recommend, Council President, that

37
00:14:14,515 --> 00:14:29,525
[SPEAKER_29]: We have Barbara here at one of our upcoming meetings so we can present her with a citation with appreciation for all of our hard work for the citizens and the residents of Medford and working at our Medford Public Library for 40 years.

38
00:14:29,805 --> 00:14:30,506
[SPEAKER_29]: Very impressive.

39
00:14:30,526 --> 00:14:32,347
[SPEAKER_29]: So thank you, Barbara, for all your hard work.

40
00:14:32,868 --> 00:14:34,148
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

41
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:34,829
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Tseng.

42
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:36,254
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

43
00:14:36,534 --> 00:14:39,356
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, thank you, Councilor Scarpelli for putting this on the agenda.

44
00:14:40,537 --> 00:14:45,500
[SPEAKER_19]: Barbara is such a foundational part of what makes the public library tick.

45
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:53,605
[SPEAKER_19]: And as you noted, and I think as we can all agree, our library is a gem of Medford Square and it's a gem of the Medford community.

46
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:57,445
[SPEAKER_19]: Tons of people come from out of the city to use it.

47
00:14:58,245 --> 00:15:00,486
[SPEAKER_19]: Our residents, I think, very much treasure it.

48
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:03,668
[SPEAKER_19]: And Barbara's hard work is what makes it tick.

49
00:15:04,989 --> 00:15:09,352
[SPEAKER_19]: She works so hard when it comes to making sure the library has the resources she needs.

50
00:15:09,932 --> 00:15:14,535
[SPEAKER_19]: It needs making sure that there's enough programming for

51
00:15:15,769 --> 00:15:22,517
[SPEAKER_19]: of wide range of Medford residents, despite their age, their background, making sure that people feel welcome in that space as well.

52
00:15:23,418 --> 00:15:32,509
[SPEAKER_19]: Her hard work on getting the new library built, as is, is also something that our city council should really recognize and be thankful for.

53
00:15:35,051 --> 00:15:42,333
[SPEAKER_19]: also relevant to the City Council is the work that she puts into letting us know what resources the library needs.

54
00:15:42,493 --> 00:15:52,877
[SPEAKER_19]: I know a lot of us have been at the annual sit-downs before the budget season with the library staff and the Board of Trustees where they let us know what they need.

55
00:15:53,437 --> 00:16:00,399
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's a testament to her organization and her energy doing that work and fighting for the public library.

56
00:16:01,563 --> 00:16:03,185
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm very grateful for this resolution.

57
00:16:03,205 --> 00:16:05,988
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli for introducing it.

58
00:16:06,188 --> 00:16:07,089
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

59
00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:08,130
[SPEAKER_24]: Vice President Collins.

60
00:16:09,633 --> 00:16:09,813
[SPEAKER_18]: Great.

61
00:16:10,534 --> 00:16:19,960
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you as well, Councilor Scarpelli for putting this on and making sure that we properly recognized Director Kerr for her 40 incredible years leading the Medford Public Library.

62
00:16:21,841 --> 00:16:24,823
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, a lot great has been said about Barbara.

63
00:16:25,223 --> 00:16:31,167
[SPEAKER_18]: We could go on all night just talking about Barbara, but what really strikes me about her from all the meetings we've had with her over the past three years is she brings

64
00:16:33,007 --> 00:16:48,492
[SPEAKER_18]: Obviously, so much skill so much knowledge so much experience to run the library and she's been doing this for four decades and she's made sure that our library remains contemporary over the years and she really fought to make sure that we can now enjoy a public modern contemporary public library and.

65
00:16:49,744 --> 00:16:59,972
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, some people know really well just how, just how much hard work and advocacy and how many risks it took to make it the incredible, you know, really model library that it is today.

66
00:17:00,032 --> 00:17:10,740
[SPEAKER_18]: So we can't thank her enough, not just for the recent, you know, really, really visible accomplishments, but for all of the work that preceded that to bring us to the community space that we get to enjoy and that we'll get to enjoy for so many years to come.

67
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,821
[SPEAKER_18]: So thank you, Barbara.

68
00:17:11,901 --> 00:17:13,622
[SPEAKER_18]: We could truly go on all night talking about her.

69
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:14,283
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

70
00:17:16,397 --> 00:17:41,913
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Councilor Collins, and I just want to note certainly to thank Barbara, and I think Barbara would also want us to thank her staff, the trustees, the Library Foundation, which has been so instrumental in the construction of and outfitting of the new library, the friends of the Medford Public Library, and all of the folks who walk through those doors or use the online resources or take out a book

71
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:55,095
[SPEAKER_24]: or other material at the library has really become so much more than just a place to go and get a book, but it really provides essential community services to so many people in our community, especially our kids and our teens.

72
00:17:55,975 --> 00:17:59,097
[SPEAKER_24]: So just thank you to Barbara and the whole library team.

73
00:18:00,377 --> 00:18:07,380
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Tseng, and we will invite Director Kerr for a citation in the new year.

211
00:25:24,876 --> 00:25:27,677
[SPEAKER_24]: Loan order, school HVAC infrastructure and roof bonds.

212
00:25:27,917 --> 00:25:34,020
[SPEAKER_24]: Dear President Bears and members of the city council, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve the below loan order.

213
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:40,502
[SPEAKER_24]: By way of some background, the Andrews and McGlynn Middle Schools are in need of extensive HVAC work, as well as at least repairs to the McGlynn School roof.

214
00:25:41,102 --> 00:25:49,706
[SPEAKER_24]: The city has hired an owner's project manager and designer with the goal of conducting the majority of the construction work during the summer months to further the project and keep the timetable for construction

215
00:25:50,342 --> 00:26:01,110
[SPEAKER_24]: In January, the city needs to pre-order equipment, continue to design with the designer and OPM and the pre-construction services of the construction manager to accomplish this, a fundering authorization of about $5 million is needed.

216
00:26:01,671 --> 00:26:09,817
[SPEAKER_24]: In the future, after further designing cost estimates have been finalized, we will likely return for the rest of the cost to complete construction, which is expected to be about an additional $20 million.

217
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:41,060
[SPEAKER_24]: City of Medford loan order, school HVAC infrastructure and roof bonds, be it ordered that $5 million is appropriated for the purpose of replacing boilers and cooling systems with new condensing boilers and heat pumps, including associated automatic controls, structural and architectural work, electrical work and weatherization at the McGlynn School and Andrew School, and the acquisition and installation of solar panels for a new roof and a new roof or roof repairs at the McGlynn School, including the cost of planning, design, architectural and engineering services and all other costs incidental and related thereto.

218
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:56,757
[SPEAKER_24]: And that this appropriation to meet this appropriation the treasurer, with the approval of the mayor is authorized to borrow the set amount pursuant to chapter 44 section seven subsection one of the Massachusetts general laws or pursuant to any other enabling authority, and to issue the bonds or notes of the city therefore.

219
00:26:57,398 --> 00:27:15,983
[SPEAKER_24]: and further ordered that the treasurer is authorized to file an application with the appropriate officials of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the Commonwealth to qualify under chapter 44A of the general laws, any and all bonds of the city authorized to be borrowed pursuant to this loan order and to provide such information and execute such documents as officials of the Commonwealth may require in connection therewith.

220
00:27:16,543 --> 00:27:18,563
[SPEAKER_24]: Respectfully submitted, Breanna Lungo-Koehn, Mayor.

221
00:27:19,163 --> 00:27:25,165
[SPEAKER_24]: We have Director Hunt and Assistant Superintendent Cushing with us tonight to further discuss the project.

222
00:27:26,963 --> 00:27:31,284
[SPEAKER_24]: do you have a presentation before we move to questions from the council?

223
00:27:33,706 --> 00:27:41,432
[SPEAKER_14]: I have slides that we showed last night, but what I was going to offer is that I would give you a brief summary and why now.

224
00:27:42,112 --> 00:27:58,164
[SPEAKER_14]: And then if the city council would like to do a committee of the whole with the materials that we had last night at the early January before the third reading, assuming that the council is willing to do the first reading tonight,

225
00:27:58,484 --> 00:27:59,644
[SPEAKER_14]: We'd be happy to do that.

226
00:28:00,025 --> 00:28:13,749
[SPEAKER_14]: We also, the timing of this is that we're asking for $5 million now to get the project, we've been started, but to get a number of the design work done and long lead time items purchased.

227
00:28:14,469 --> 00:28:16,390
[SPEAKER_14]: There are some items we would like to have.

228
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:19,091
[SPEAKER_14]: We expect to have the air conditioning working by September.

229
00:28:19,571 --> 00:28:23,332
[SPEAKER_14]: To do that, some of the equipment has more than 16 weekly times.

230
00:28:23,973 --> 00:28:27,134
[SPEAKER_14]: And so we would like to order that equipment as quickly as possible.

231
00:28:27,574 --> 00:28:38,358
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're asking for the $5 million now for the early work and the funding to take the design to 100% design and to bring the construction manager at risk on.

232
00:28:38,978 --> 00:28:40,659
[SPEAKER_14]: And then our intention is to come back

233
00:28:41,141 --> 00:28:46,763
[SPEAKER_14]: either in late March or early April and ask for additional money that would be the rest of the money for this project.

234
00:28:46,803 --> 00:28:48,684
[SPEAKER_14]: This is not a $5 million project.

235
00:28:48,944 --> 00:28:51,905
[SPEAKER_14]: This is more like a $25 million project.

236
00:28:53,125 --> 00:28:59,007
[SPEAKER_14]: And we would be happy to do a committee of the whole first week of January, second week of January, if you'd like.

237
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:06,878
[SPEAKER_14]: or we can end or we could do a more complete once we have 100% construction documents in March, a committee of the whole.

238
00:29:07,618 --> 00:29:14,625
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm also prepared to share some slides this evening or go into some more of the details this evening, but I didn't wanna take an hour out of a city council meeting.

239
00:29:14,665 --> 00:29:20,150
[SPEAKER_14]: I wanted to give you the basics tonight and then schedule something longer in early January.

240
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:20,811
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

241
00:29:20,851 --> 00:29:24,774
[SPEAKER_24]: And just to confirm the school committee did discuss this last night and there was a vote of the school committee.

242
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:25,877
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

243
00:29:26,017 --> 00:29:26,417
[SPEAKER_20]: Good evening.

244
00:29:26,497 --> 00:29:28,698
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for allowing me to speak this evening.

245
00:29:29,139 --> 00:29:38,803
[SPEAKER_20]: Last night, the school committee voted 7 to 0 in full support of this critical repair project for these two schools where the systems are failing or failed.

246
00:29:39,383 --> 00:29:39,763
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

247
00:29:39,843 --> 00:29:42,804
[SPEAKER_24]: With that, I will go to the council for questions and further discussion.

248
00:29:43,245 --> 00:29:44,085
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Scarpelli.

249
00:29:44,605 --> 00:29:45,406
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Mr. President.

250
00:29:45,506 --> 00:29:45,826
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

251
00:29:46,146 --> 00:29:48,907
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm glad that

252
00:29:51,391 --> 00:29:55,595
[SPEAKER_29]: I would welcome that we go, we revert this to a committee of the whole meeting.

253
00:29:55,655 --> 00:30:06,666
[SPEAKER_29]: I think that when you're talking something about in the process of a $25 million project, I think this is where we need to sit down before we vote on anything and just look into the finances and what

254
00:30:07,216 --> 00:30:11,158
[SPEAKER_29]: where we're going in our community and where we are since the override.

255
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:14,280
[SPEAKER_29]: I know that there are big questions out there.

256
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,181
[SPEAKER_29]: What are we still doing with the fire department?

257
00:30:16,201 --> 00:30:19,162
[SPEAKER_29]: What are we doing with the new high school if that comes down the line?

258
00:30:19,563 --> 00:30:21,023
[SPEAKER_29]: How much money will we be able to bond?

259
00:30:21,504 --> 00:30:23,465
[SPEAKER_29]: So it'll be interesting to get those questions answered.

260
00:30:23,485 --> 00:30:29,488
[SPEAKER_29]: And to approve $5 million not knowing, with some clarity for the other $20 million, I think that would

261
00:30:29,997 --> 00:30:33,458
[SPEAKER_29]: that would be irresponsible for us to move that forward.

262
00:30:33,478 --> 00:30:39,041
[SPEAKER_29]: So I would recommend that we move this completely to a committee of the whole meeting so we can look at the different options.

263
00:30:39,081 --> 00:30:46,583
[SPEAKER_29]: I know there's been some talk that there's been some money freed up from ARPA due to the override success.

264
00:30:46,623 --> 00:30:53,446
[SPEAKER_29]: So it'd be interesting to see if we can use other avenues to look into possible ways to fund.

265
00:30:53,506 --> 00:30:57,968
[SPEAKER_29]: So I know it's needed, not saying that I wouldn't support it, but I think that

266
00:30:58,768 --> 00:31:08,614
[SPEAKER_29]: for one council, and we're talking about being stewards of our budgetary process, I think it's important that we sit down and evaluate the whole financial process.

267
00:31:08,634 --> 00:31:12,636
[SPEAKER_29]: It's nice that the school committee voted 7-0 because they should.

268
00:31:13,117 --> 00:31:27,225
[SPEAKER_29]: They want everything fixed, but they don't control the budgetary process, and I think it's important that this council really understands our whole, because I believe we talked about this too, Council President, is understanding our

269
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:31,008
[SPEAKER_29]: capital plan and understanding where we're going with that capital plan.

270
00:31:31,028 --> 00:31:41,356
[SPEAKER_29]: So I would recommend, I appreciate your thoughts and your leadership, but I would recommend we go directly to community to the whole with this process from beginning to end.

271
00:31:41,416 --> 00:31:42,357
[SPEAKER_29]: So thank you, Mr. President.

272
00:31:42,745 --> 00:31:43,085
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

273
00:31:43,105 --> 00:31:51,990
[SPEAKER_24]: Before I recognize Councilor Collins and Councilor Callahan, I do just want to note on the ARPA funding that has to be encumbered by December 31st.

274
00:31:52,251 --> 00:32:01,576
[SPEAKER_24]: And we did receive a communication from the mayor at a large chunk of that 800,000 plus dollars that we were able to buy a fire engine from the city of Lynn.

275
00:32:01,796 --> 00:32:03,777
[SPEAKER_24]: So there's a new fire engine coming through that money.

276
00:32:05,018 --> 00:32:07,880
[SPEAKER_24]: So a large chunk of that money has been appropriated.

277
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,581
[SPEAKER_24]: It does have to be encumbered by the end of the year.

278
00:32:09,601 --> 00:32:11,202
[SPEAKER_24]: I'll go to Vice President Collins.

279
00:32:13,837 --> 00:32:14,517
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Bears.

280
00:32:14,537 --> 00:32:18,698
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you so much for being with us tonight and thank you for being with the school committee yesterday.

281
00:32:18,718 --> 00:32:25,880
[SPEAKER_18]: I know it's a really busy time of year, but it's really exciting to see that this project is being pushed forward.

282
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:30,941
[SPEAKER_18]: We've been hearing about the HVAC issues in Medford Public Schools for a really long time.

283
00:32:31,701 --> 00:32:32,981
[SPEAKER_18]: It feels like forever.

284
00:32:33,001 --> 00:32:40,323
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's exciting to be at a point where we can be talking about pre-implementation and implementation of the projects that will

285
00:32:40,923 --> 00:32:45,725
[SPEAKER_18]: allow the schools to remain the comfortable temperatures that students can learn and thrive in.

286
00:32:47,346 --> 00:32:56,650
[SPEAKER_18]: Before any motions are made, I'd be eager to hear that kind of like brief synopsis about the bird's eye view, why now to kind of get our heads around the urgency around this.

287
00:32:57,711 --> 00:33:06,875
[SPEAKER_18]: To me, we've been hearing from parents and educators for such a long time about the really severe heating and cooling issues in the Medford public schools that I feel pretty comfortable taking a vote on this ASAP.

288
00:33:07,715 --> 00:33:09,156
[SPEAKER_18]: but I'd like to hear your presentation first.

289
00:33:09,436 --> 00:33:09,716
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

290
00:33:09,956 --> 00:33:13,218
[SPEAKER_18]: Or the short form your presentation first, to be clear, not the hour long version.

291
00:33:13,318 --> 00:33:13,618
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

292
00:33:16,199 --> 00:33:16,439
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

293
00:33:16,459 --> 00:33:17,460
[SPEAKER_24]: I'll go to Councilor Callahan.

294
00:33:19,701 --> 00:33:20,281
[SPEAKER_37]: Steal my thunder.

295
00:33:20,621 --> 00:33:24,803
[SPEAKER_37]: I basically was going to see if you had, like, how short is your short version of your presentation?

296
00:33:24,823 --> 00:33:28,004
[SPEAKER_37]: And if there's something you can give that's five minutes or less that can really give us an overview.

297
00:33:29,965 --> 00:33:34,207
[SPEAKER_37]: And as well, if you can also give us a little bit of an understanding of

298
00:33:36,669 --> 00:33:50,243
[SPEAKER_37]: exactly how important the timing is and whether getting something, you know, obviously this is a process, it would not be approved tonight, it has three readings, whether us bringing it forward tonight is crucial to the timeline.

299
00:33:50,463 --> 00:33:50,644
[SPEAKER_37]: Thanks.

300
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,920
[SPEAKER_14]: Council President, thank you.

301
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:16,004
[SPEAKER_14]: We have with us tonight our owners project manager, Tom Ellis, and I believe that it would make sense for him to actually address the questions of the timing and the urgency that it feels like he's prepared to speak to why and how that timing would work.

302
00:34:17,045 --> 00:34:22,746
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that's better than trying to go through all the materials about the whole thing.

303
00:34:22,766 --> 00:34:25,607
[SPEAKER_14]: So why don't I introduce Tom and I'll let him explain.

304
00:34:26,121 --> 00:34:26,782
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Tom.

305
00:34:26,962 --> 00:34:27,263
[SPEAKER_24]: Go ahead.

306
00:34:27,784 --> 00:34:29,887
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you for inviting me today.

307
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:34,215
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, the timing of the project financing is important.

308
00:34:34,859 --> 00:34:39,042
[SPEAKER_28]: We've started the design process and have learned a lot about what the needs are for the project.

309
00:34:39,523 --> 00:34:49,891
[SPEAKER_28]: It's a very complex effort to try to keep the schools occupied, as well as make these adjustments in the mechanical systems and replacing them.

310
00:34:49,911 --> 00:34:53,374
[SPEAKER_28]: Basically, replacing the engine while you're trying to keep the car moving.

311
00:34:53,814 --> 00:34:55,696
[SPEAKER_28]: So it's going to be a challenge to do that.

312
00:34:56,076 --> 00:35:00,940
[SPEAKER_28]: But to do so, we're using a construction management risk delivery method, which allows

313
00:35:01,488 --> 00:35:14,018
[SPEAKER_28]: the builder to be engaged in the process because there's a lot of logistics involved with keeping the schools open, how we're going to do the work to keep it safe, to keep the air quality in the school correct as we do the work.

314
00:35:14,718 --> 00:35:19,402
[SPEAKER_28]: But to do so, we need to engage the construction manager early in 2025.

315
00:35:22,249 --> 00:35:25,009
[SPEAKER_28]: 2025.

316
00:35:23,009 --> 00:35:25,009
[SPEAKER_28]: And to do so, we need the funding to do so.

317
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:28,371
[SPEAKER_28]: So we need the pre-construction services fee to do that.

318
00:35:28,491 --> 00:35:32,352
[SPEAKER_28]: We need to keep the design team moving forward with additional funding.

319
00:35:32,912 --> 00:35:39,795
[SPEAKER_28]: And we also need funds for early purchasing of the mechanical equipment, and it's in excess of $3 million.

320
00:35:40,755 --> 00:35:53,342
[SPEAKER_28]: And because of the supply chain issues with mechanical systems that could take anywhere 16 to 20 weeks to whenever, we need to get that material and equipment ordered quickly and soon.

321
00:35:53,462 --> 00:35:58,605
[SPEAKER_28]: So that's the urgency involved is to get the equipment there so that we can start the work over the summer.

322
00:35:59,045 --> 00:36:04,971
[SPEAKER_28]: and get most of the work done, it will continue into the fall, but to get the air conditioning systems operational.

323
00:36:05,011 --> 00:36:10,677
[SPEAKER_28]: So hopefully in August, the school will have air conditioning available.

324
00:36:10,977 --> 00:36:14,861
[SPEAKER_28]: So that's the urgency of the issue of trying to get the funding to start the work soon.

325
00:36:15,902 --> 00:36:20,547
[SPEAKER_28]: So I think that's kind of the big overview at this point.

326
00:36:21,431 --> 00:36:33,204
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I'll just, I think that this council knows this, I will sort of repeat it for the public, that in approving something like this, there would be a first reading, there would be an advertising period, and there would be a third reading.

327
00:36:33,905 --> 00:36:40,733
[SPEAKER_14]: So it wouldn't necessarily, and like this evening there was a third reading that went through very, very quickly because you were all very well briefed on that.

328
00:36:41,253 --> 00:36:42,213
[SPEAKER_14]: at the first reading.

329
00:36:43,213 --> 00:36:54,636
[SPEAKER_14]: I would respectfully request that you consider a first reading tonight and a committee of the whole in January and the advertising to be able to then consider this on the January 15th meeting.

330
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:57,596
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's the 15th, 14th.

331
00:36:57,916 --> 00:37:04,617
[SPEAKER_14]: Just to keep this moving, I think your next meeting in January would be around the 31st, 28th.

332
00:37:04,798 --> 00:37:06,378
[SPEAKER_14]: My apologies, I didn't put a calendar up.

333
00:37:07,762 --> 00:37:13,430
[SPEAKER_14]: And it would be great to be able to get these things because the contracting can take a couple weeks, et cetera.

334
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:18,036
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's the timeline that we're really looking on here.

335
00:37:20,114 --> 00:37:23,115
[SPEAKER_14]: I had one other thing, but it slipped my mind, so sorry.

336
00:37:23,675 --> 00:37:23,875
[SPEAKER_24]: Thanks.

337
00:37:23,915 --> 00:37:25,335
[SPEAKER_24]: I'll go to Vice President Collins.

338
00:37:25,435 --> 00:37:27,756
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, sorry, Mr. Cushing, then Vice President Collins and Councilor Scarpelli.

339
00:37:27,776 --> 00:37:29,416
[SPEAKER_20]: I also just really want to talk about the why.

340
00:37:30,396 --> 00:37:40,238
[SPEAKER_20]: So as I have mentioned numerous times before the distinguished school body, the reality is that Medford still sees these buildings as the new schools.

341
00:37:40,878 --> 00:37:48,720
[SPEAKER_20]: As Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, hopefully they will be supplanted by a new Med or renovated Medford High School in a few years.

342
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:53,263
[SPEAKER_20]: These buildings have a lifespan at 23 years old.

343
00:37:54,383 --> 00:37:58,826
[SPEAKER_20]: There are significant challenges with the HVAC systems in those buildings.

344
00:37:59,346 --> 00:38:11,855
[SPEAKER_20]: This project initially started with a comprehensive review of the Andrews Middle School, and not to be outdone, the McGlynn systems failed significantly more rapidly over the last few years.

345
00:38:12,975 --> 00:38:20,138
[SPEAKER_20]: There are large swaths of that building, including gyms, auditorium, cafeteria, that have little to no air conditioning whatsoever.

346
00:38:20,978 --> 00:38:26,860
[SPEAKER_20]: Classroom units, rooftop units that cool the classrooms have failed.

347
00:38:27,821 --> 00:38:33,223
[SPEAKER_20]: And the Andrews Middle School has had problems since the building was first opened.

348
00:38:33,963 --> 00:38:41,866
[SPEAKER_20]: It has been termed by our engineers who work on it from a vendor as just having consistent gremlins over the years.

349
00:38:42,726 --> 00:38:55,151
[SPEAKER_20]: There are issues with both of these buildings that cause a substantial detriment to student learning, staff functionality, and potentially giving climate change the health and safety of our students and staff.

350
00:38:56,271 --> 00:39:04,054
[SPEAKER_20]: There's a moment to act where that can be put on the table for the upcoming FY26 academic year.

351
00:39:07,194 --> 00:39:14,858
[SPEAKER_20]: If we wait, if we wait, that will delay our ability to deploy these systems so that classrooms are cooled.

352
00:39:15,338 --> 00:39:21,962
[SPEAKER_20]: The gyms and other large areas will come online shortly thereafter, probably middle-ish of September.

353
00:39:22,402 --> 00:39:34,708
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to be clear that the first systems that will be completed will be the water side, which services the classrooms, and then will be the large spaces that are done by forced air.

354
00:39:37,765 --> 00:39:40,286
[SPEAKER_20]: I've presented in front of the school committee numerous times on this.

355
00:39:40,766 --> 00:39:45,467
[SPEAKER_20]: It has consumed a large part of the school district's energies over the past several years.

356
00:39:46,267 --> 00:39:58,811
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm here to basically beg on behalf of the staff and students of these schools that we advance this project with multiple readings.

357
00:39:59,721 --> 00:40:04,143
[SPEAKER_20]: you'll have the opportunity to pull back if our presentations don't meet your expectations.

358
00:40:04,743 --> 00:40:18,529
[SPEAKER_20]: But this is what I would consider to be a moral obligation to make sure that these facilities that service our students, many of whom may be vulnerable for any number of reasons, provide the environment that is needed.

359
00:40:19,049 --> 00:40:27,153
[SPEAKER_20]: There is also, hopefully, that we can slide in ahead with some of this ordering to avoid the impending tariffs

360
00:40:27,873 --> 00:40:30,115
[SPEAKER_20]: that have been described by the incoming administration.

361
00:40:31,016 --> 00:40:41,986
[SPEAKER_20]: It is a significant, the audience may laugh, but it is a significant concern of our team putting this together about what the cost implications may be moving forward.

362
00:40:43,287 --> 00:40:44,107
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Mr. Cushing.

363
00:40:44,127 --> 00:40:47,611
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't think anyone's excited for the 30 percent cost increases we're all about to see.

364
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:49,072
[SPEAKER_24]: Vice President Collins.

365
00:40:52,438 --> 00:40:54,000
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for the presentation.

366
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:56,362
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for the succinctness.

367
00:40:57,743 --> 00:41:12,157
[SPEAKER_18]: Certainly, I don't think that any of us think that our students and educators and school staff should be put in the position of having to beg for classrooms that are a temperature at which you can focus and deliver good education and learn and be comfortable enough to get through the day and really get something out of

368
00:41:12,857 --> 00:41:15,158
[SPEAKER_18]: the education that Medford Public Schools offers.

369
00:41:16,298 --> 00:41:28,663
[SPEAKER_18]: And I would be really happy to work with President Bears to make sure that we can get a committee of the whole on the January schedule as quickly as possible so that we can advance this tonight, if it is the will of the council, do our due diligence, and then try to get this out the door.

370
00:41:28,703 --> 00:41:39,527
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I do understand, you know, I think anybody who has any passing familiarity with projects of this scale, you know, I know that we have a really tight timeframe that you're trying to get this done in so that these improvements are up and running for the beginning.

371
00:41:40,167 --> 00:41:41,228
[SPEAKER_18]: of the next school year.

372
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:47,013
[SPEAKER_18]: And if we miss that window, that manifests in unhappy students and unhappy educators and unhappy families.

373
00:41:47,534 --> 00:41:58,663
[SPEAKER_18]: So with that, I would motion to approve for first reading and for city council leadership to work to schedule a committee of the whole for more in-depth conversation at our first opportunity in January.

374
00:42:00,905 --> 00:42:09,588
[SPEAKER_24]: Council Vice President Collins has motioned to approve for first reading and to schedule a committee of the whole in early January prior to third reading for a more in-depth presentation.

375
00:42:09,688 --> 00:42:10,708
[SPEAKER_24]: Is there a second on that motion?

376
00:42:10,728 --> 00:42:11,229
[SPEAKER_24]: Second.

377
00:42:12,929 --> 00:42:13,269
[SPEAKER_24]: Several.

378
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:18,011
[SPEAKER_24]: I'll go with Councilor Lazzaro and then I will go to Councilor Scarpelli for further discussion.

379
00:42:23,953 --> 00:42:26,454
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, I'm just gonna go to Councilor Scarpelli and then Councilor

380
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:32,770
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh, thank you.

381
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:33,451
[SPEAKER_29]: Can you hear me?

382
00:42:34,751 --> 00:42:35,172
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

383
00:42:35,252 --> 00:42:42,255
[SPEAKER_29]: I can just see social media today saying, quote, Councilor Scarpelli doesn't want to keep the kids warm and the teachers cool in the summer.

384
00:42:42,315 --> 00:42:45,257
[SPEAKER_29]: So let's be realistic.

385
00:42:45,737 --> 00:42:46,818
[SPEAKER_29]: That's number one priority.

386
00:42:47,138 --> 00:42:47,698
[SPEAKER_29]: We all know that.

387
00:42:48,058 --> 00:42:53,521
[SPEAKER_29]: But we also want to make sure that when I taught there 15 years ago, we had the same issues.

388
00:42:54,182 --> 00:42:55,863
[SPEAKER_29]: So we understand that have to get done.

389
00:42:55,903 --> 00:42:58,224
[SPEAKER_29]: But what I'm saying is I don't see a few weeks

390
00:42:59,349 --> 00:43:02,350
[SPEAKER_29]: to track back and really understand the total process.

391
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:05,111
[SPEAKER_29]: Now, all due respect, Tom, thank you for your presentation.

392
00:43:05,131 --> 00:43:05,911
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't even know who you are.

393
00:43:05,931 --> 00:43:06,792
[SPEAKER_29]: Are we paying you?

394
00:43:07,572 --> 00:43:13,834
[SPEAKER_29]: Like we don't, there's processes like, you know, how is the procurement process look?

395
00:43:13,874 --> 00:43:20,077
[SPEAKER_29]: How are we going to, has issues with the MSBA been approved yet for 25 million?

396
00:43:20,117 --> 00:43:20,317
[SPEAKER_29]: Have we

397
00:43:20,877 --> 00:43:43,835
[SPEAKER_29]: have we looked at other avenues do we look at the trajectory of our city's finances when we're looking to how we're going to bomb this so i think that this is this isn't something that we're saying at least this council saying that i don't want this this is council wants to just bring it back and look at this in totality not because the city school committee voted seven nothing because we have issues like the air condition is not going to work in august

398
00:43:45,196 --> 00:43:48,941
[SPEAKER_29]: This is a few weeks that we slow things down and go through the process the correct way.

399
00:43:49,322 --> 00:43:56,471
[SPEAKER_29]: And that's to see the full health of our financial future here in the city of Method because I'd like to know, there might be more.

400
00:43:57,252 --> 00:44:00,497
[SPEAKER_29]: There might be more that we don't know about because this is coming up

401
00:44:01,323 --> 00:44:01,783
[SPEAKER_29]: that we have to look at.

402
00:44:01,803 --> 00:44:04,125
[SPEAKER_29]: We have to look at what's relatively new and how quick this is and how much it's going to be.

403
00:44:04,586 --> 00:44:12,032
[SPEAKER_29]: Where as we look forward, there might be more that the mayor has has planned, but we don't know about that says, Well, there's another five million that we have to look at.

404
00:44:12,412 --> 00:44:14,894
[SPEAKER_29]: So the kids can go into a safe school.

405
00:44:14,914 --> 00:44:16,355
[SPEAKER_29]: Maybe something's wrong with the doors.

406
00:44:16,876 --> 00:44:19,218
[SPEAKER_29]: We don't know yet because we haven't been discussing this.

407
00:44:19,658 --> 00:44:23,281
[SPEAKER_29]: All we received is this this motion for a loan order and to

408
00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:44,943
[SPEAKER_29]: my council vice president bring that forward and was seconded, but I won't be supporting it for the fact that I'd rather have the meeting before we put five, move $5 million that we can start the process before we know truly what our fiscal overview looks like in this community.

409
00:44:45,664 --> 00:44:49,827
[SPEAKER_29]: Cause that's something that's been questioned multiple times in the last few months.

410
00:44:50,028 --> 00:44:50,508
[SPEAKER_29]: So thank you.

411
00:44:51,589 --> 00:44:51,989
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

412
00:44:52,049 --> 00:44:52,690
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Tseng.

413
00:44:55,273 --> 00:44:55,653
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

414
00:44:56,294 --> 00:45:09,788
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, I do feel comfortable voting yes on the first reading tonight, and I'll explain why I've been following this conversation for, as you've noted, this has been a conversation for years, and especially in recent months with school committee meetings.

415
00:45:10,488 --> 00:45:14,732
[SPEAKER_19]: There are materials out there for us to look at and I know they haven't come straight to the city council yet.

416
00:45:15,393 --> 00:45:16,694
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, this is

417
00:45:17,976 --> 00:45:28,558
[SPEAKER_19]: an issue of urgency for a lot of our students for, as you said, for health, for safety, for student performance, for functionality, for our teachers sake.

418
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:41,061
[SPEAKER_19]: I know a lot of, you know, things were, in my experience, they're having problems in the past with the HVAC system from what teachers and students have told me and parents have told me that things have only gotten worse.

419
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:50,667
[SPEAKER_19]: I think Councilor Scarpelli does raise good questions about how this fits into our financial plan going forward.

420
00:45:51,447 --> 00:45:55,891
[SPEAKER_19]: And I do know that this is something that has been at the forefront of financial planning for our city.

421
00:45:56,552 --> 00:46:00,435
[SPEAKER_19]: We've known about this cost that was going to come before us for years.

422
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:04,192
[SPEAKER_19]: for longer than I've been on the city council.

423
00:46:05,193 --> 00:46:07,455
[SPEAKER_19]: But you know what, there are questions.

424
00:46:07,535 --> 00:46:13,281
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think all of us behind the rail are in agreement that a committee, the whole meeting would be good and helpful.

425
00:46:14,262 --> 00:46:18,426
[SPEAKER_19]: The reason why I feel comfortable voting yes on the first reading is as you noted, votes can change.

426
00:46:18,967 --> 00:46:26,214
[SPEAKER_19]: We can decide to vote this down on the third reading if our answers aren't resolved or questions aren't resolved.

427
00:46:27,063 --> 00:46:43,424
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, I think, functionally voting yes on a first reading tonight and both voting for cancer, Scarf Ellie's motion on lead us to very similar places, the difference being the two week gap, the, the, the potentially even more than two weeks gap.

428
00:46:44,565 --> 00:46:45,886
[SPEAKER_19]: that pushing this off would be.

429
00:46:47,026 --> 00:46:53,549
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it's really important to underscore to everyone watching at home and here that that time does matter.

430
00:46:53,609 --> 00:46:57,791
[SPEAKER_19]: That timeline does matter for the success of a city's project.

431
00:46:58,391 --> 00:47:06,614
[SPEAKER_19]: There are tons of projects out there that we've had to wait a cycle or put on hold because we weren't able to get the bids out in time.

432
00:47:06,654 --> 00:47:11,236
[SPEAKER_19]: We weren't able to do X, Y, Z. And it's really important that we meet the timelines as is.

433
00:47:13,891 --> 00:47:27,660
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it'd be helpful for the council going forward if we could submit some questions to city staff before the committee, the whole meeting, if we could see some of the slides before that meeting as well, just to expedite that conversation.

434
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:37,686
[SPEAKER_19]: I think we can have a very rich and deep conversation about, you know, the questions that my fellow councillors have raised about the need and urgency for this going forward.

435
00:47:38,947 --> 00:47:43,450
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think we can have that depth of conversation as long as we're prepared for it.

436
00:47:45,694 --> 00:47:46,795
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you counsel is our.

437
00:47:48,456 --> 00:47:59,763
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you, thank you for your presentation, I think we can also probably watch the school committee meeting from yesterday in between now and when we have our committee of the whole and review that presentation as well which could be really beneficial to all of us.

438
00:48:00,883 --> 00:48:04,786
[SPEAKER_40]: I feel comfortable voting yes for this I also think that when you mentioned the gremlins.

439
00:48:05,302 --> 00:48:17,569
[SPEAKER_40]: There may have been, I'm not sure if this happened, but there may have been some measures taken in the prior projects being done that we could avoid this time around.

440
00:48:17,969 --> 00:48:25,694
[SPEAKER_40]: Hopefully we won't have gremlins in this project and we can have just a really solid foundation with this HVAC system.

441
00:48:26,354 --> 00:48:27,835
[SPEAKER_40]: I would hope we could avoid that this time.

442
00:48:29,516 --> 00:48:31,857
[SPEAKER_40]: So thank you, I appreciate you coming here and presenting this.

443
00:48:33,518 --> 00:48:33,759
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

444
00:48:35,687 --> 00:48:42,570
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion of Vice President Collins as amended to request a committee of the whole in January, please wait, thank you.

445
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:56,416
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion of Vice President Collins to request a committee of the whole and also amended by Councilor Tseng to request the slides be shared with the council by email and also that councilors can submit questions.

446
00:48:56,817 --> 00:49:00,058
[SPEAKER_24]: Should they submit them to you Director Hunt and Assistant Superintendent Cushing directly?

447
00:49:00,678 --> 00:49:01,619
[SPEAKER_24]: Great, thank you.

448
00:49:03,039 --> 00:49:04,340
[SPEAKER_24]: Vice President Collins, do you have anything further?

449
00:49:07,403 --> 00:49:07,784
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

450
00:49:08,485 --> 00:49:08,765
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

451
00:49:08,805 --> 00:49:09,306
[SPEAKER_18]: Before we vote.

452
00:49:09,346 --> 00:49:12,530
[SPEAKER_18]: I just wanted to appreciate my Councilor discussion of this item.

453
00:49:12,590 --> 00:49:14,272
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm very much looking forward to the committee of the whole.

454
00:49:14,713 --> 00:49:16,375
[SPEAKER_18]: I also just wanted to follow up and

455
00:49:17,571 --> 00:49:21,014
[SPEAKER_18]: to make clear just because of the way that it's being talked about.

456
00:49:21,334 --> 00:49:25,557
[SPEAKER_18]: This is a request for a loan order for $5 million.

457
00:49:26,057 --> 00:49:31,061
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't want people to come away with the impression that the city is, after this vote, writing a check for $5 million.

458
00:49:31,081 --> 00:49:31,761
[SPEAKER_18]: That's not the case.

459
00:49:32,722 --> 00:49:38,166
[SPEAKER_18]: The loan order, you know, this is a process that we very, very, very commonly use for large capital expenses like this.

460
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:41,268
[SPEAKER_18]: This is normal to take out a loan order for this.

461
00:49:41,288 --> 00:49:42,749
[SPEAKER_18]: It's like the way this is normally done.

462
00:49:42,769 --> 00:49:44,651
[SPEAKER_18]: We're not just writing a check from some

463
00:49:45,491 --> 00:49:46,332
[SPEAKER_18]: city checking account.

464
00:49:46,372 --> 00:49:47,252
[SPEAKER_18]: That's not how this works.

465
00:49:47,992 --> 00:49:59,397
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, and I just, you know, I've had so many conversations with constituents about heating and cooling in MPS buildings for so many years that I really would be remiss to not just affirm that this is not a new project.

466
00:49:59,437 --> 00:50:06,980
[SPEAKER_18]: This is really a harm that people have been feeling for years, and I'm glad that we're acting on it now, but we're actually we're acting on it late.

467
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:10,162
[SPEAKER_18]: So thank you for getting us to this point where we can be acting on it.

468
00:50:10,362 --> 00:50:10,602
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

469
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:14,985
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, and I know you guys wanted to maybe respond or answer any further questions.

470
00:50:15,026 --> 00:50:17,988
[SPEAKER_24]: I just wanted to note that this project has been on the radar.

471
00:50:18,008 --> 00:50:26,593
[SPEAKER_24]: It was in a previous capital improvement plan, and it was one of the reasons for the question six vote, because it was a large project that came up.

472
00:50:28,675 --> 00:50:31,757
[SPEAKER_24]: The proposed question six did not succeed, but it was why it was on the ballot.

473
00:50:34,039 --> 00:50:35,740
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Council President.

474
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,381
[SPEAKER_14]: I did want to just clarify two things.

475
00:50:38,421 --> 00:50:44,643
[SPEAKER_14]: So we do actually have Bob Dickinson on the Zoom this evening because of this, if there were specific questions for him.

476
00:50:45,504 --> 00:50:50,666
[SPEAKER_14]: And I did just want to clarify the roles that Tom is our owner's project manager.

477
00:50:50,766 --> 00:50:53,107
[SPEAKER_14]: He was hired in June and has been working with us.

478
00:50:53,347 --> 00:50:55,328
[SPEAKER_14]: We've been meeting weekly since mid-August.

479
00:50:55,908 --> 00:50:58,309
[SPEAKER_14]: Our designers came on board in August.

480
00:50:58,349 --> 00:51:03,491
[SPEAKER_14]: We've been using ARPA funding to fund the early work on this as well.

481
00:51:04,111 --> 00:51:14,880
[SPEAKER_14]: So the designers, Dr. Cushing, myself, our climate planner, and the designers in OPM have been meeting weekly since August on this project.

482
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:17,582
[SPEAKER_14]: We did need to get to a certain point in design.

483
00:51:17,642 --> 00:51:22,886
[SPEAKER_14]: We are right now at 30% design, which is complete schematics.

484
00:51:23,507 --> 00:51:26,890
[SPEAKER_14]: And we needed to have that information in order to know

485
00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:32,373
[SPEAKER_14]: how much to ask for in this bond and how much to be able to predict in the future one.

486
00:51:32,693 --> 00:51:36,255
[SPEAKER_14]: So I do feel like this is why, why didn't you come like a month ago?

487
00:51:36,795 --> 00:51:45,159
[SPEAKER_14]: Because we needed the 30% design or also known as the schematic design to be completed before we could ask for this money.

488
00:51:45,179 --> 00:51:49,322
[SPEAKER_14]: And now we'll be moving into the next steps in design development.

489
00:51:49,382 --> 00:51:51,743
[SPEAKER_14]: I just sort of thought that was very helpful to clarify that.

490
00:51:52,810 --> 00:51:53,591
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Director Hunt.

491
00:51:53,671 --> 00:52:00,377
[SPEAKER_24]: Any further questions by members of the Council for Director Hunt, Dr. Cushing, or for Director Dickinson on Zoom?

492
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:07,163
[SPEAKER_24]: Seeing none, we'll go to open this up for any public comment.

493
00:52:08,264 --> 00:52:10,766
[SPEAKER_24]: You can either show up at the podium or raise your hand on Zoom.

494
00:52:10,826 --> 00:52:12,528
[SPEAKER_24]: This is only for this paper.

495
00:52:12,588 --> 00:52:14,189
[SPEAKER_24]: If you have comment on this specific paper.

496
00:52:15,631 --> 00:52:17,152
[SPEAKER_24]: Seeing no hands on Zoom, we'll go to the podium.

497
00:52:17,532 --> 00:52:18,533
[SPEAKER_24]: Name and address for the record, please.

498
00:52:18,553 --> 00:52:19,194
[SPEAKER_24]: You have three minutes.

499
00:52:20,792 --> 00:52:21,293
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, thank you.

500
00:52:21,333 --> 00:52:22,234
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't need three minutes.

501
00:52:22,695 --> 00:52:23,516
[SPEAKER_16]: My name is Jean Nuzzo.

502
00:52:23,536 --> 00:52:24,857
[SPEAKER_16]: I live at Parr Street in Medford.

503
00:52:25,398 --> 00:52:26,419
[SPEAKER_16]: I just have a question.

504
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:33,689
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd like to know where the technical documentation and feasibility study and projected budget for this can be found for consumption.

505
00:52:34,069 --> 00:52:36,973
[SPEAKER_16]: Is it available online or does a FOIA request need to be submitted?

506
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:42,740
[SPEAKER_24]: I believe the materials are available in the school committee packet from last night.

507
00:52:42,941 --> 00:52:43,981
[SPEAKER_24]: I'll defer to Director Hunt.

508
00:52:44,001 --> 00:52:45,102
[SPEAKER_16]: The technical documents?

509
00:52:45,423 --> 00:52:46,944
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry, I'm deferring to, excuse me.

510
00:52:47,304 --> 00:52:47,624
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

511
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:49,185
[SPEAKER_24]: Director Hunt, do you have an answer to that question?

512
00:52:49,766 --> 00:52:51,147
[SPEAKER_24]: Or Mr. Ellis?

513
00:52:52,088 --> 00:52:55,290
[SPEAKER_16]: And the feasibility study through the chair.

514
00:52:55,310 --> 00:52:57,192
[SPEAKER_24]: You need to speak into the microphone.

515
00:52:57,552 --> 00:52:58,372
[SPEAKER_24]: Sure.

516
00:52:59,053 --> 00:52:59,493
[SPEAKER_28]: Sure, yes.

517
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:04,137
[SPEAKER_28]: The feasibility study was initially done, I believe it was over a year ago.

518
00:53:04,537 --> 00:53:05,418
[SPEAKER_28]: So that document is

519
00:53:06,030 --> 00:53:06,610
[SPEAKER_28]: is available.

520
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:08,131
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know exactly where.

521
00:53:08,551 --> 00:53:10,152
[SPEAKER_28]: I didn't put it on the web.

522
00:53:10,612 --> 00:53:11,512
[SPEAKER_24]: But it's on the school.

523
00:53:11,552 --> 00:53:12,893
[SPEAKER_24]: It was considered by the school committee.

524
00:53:12,913 --> 00:53:13,713
[SPEAKER_24]: It's on the school website.

525
00:53:13,813 --> 00:53:17,935
[SPEAKER_28]: It's a public document because it's part of our solicitation.

526
00:53:17,995 --> 00:53:19,556
[SPEAKER_28]: So yes, that information is out there.

527
00:53:19,896 --> 00:53:23,758
[SPEAKER_28]: We just received the schematic design documents from the design team.

528
00:53:23,838 --> 00:53:25,939
[SPEAKER_28]: So that's being used right now as a process.

529
00:53:25,979 --> 00:53:28,200
[SPEAKER_28]: We haven't posted that anywhere at this time.

530
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,761
[SPEAKER_24]: But it will be posted on the Medford Public Schools website.

531
00:53:34,082 --> 00:53:53,628
[SPEAKER_20]: So we have not contemplated right now how we're going to publicize and follow through with this, but we will, as we've done in previous projects, and as you'll see coming up in a few days here, right now the Brooks is going through a complete hot water replacement because that failed back in May.

532
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:57,130
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you very much for supporting that effort as well.

533
00:53:57,550 --> 00:54:02,793
[SPEAKER_20]: You'll be seeing pictures and you'll be seeing that project being updated on our Facebook page.

534
00:54:02,993 --> 00:54:05,955
[SPEAKER_20]: And we will also have the construction page somewhere on our website.

535
00:54:06,375 --> 00:54:08,376
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm happy to put all the documents up.

536
00:54:08,556 --> 00:54:12,098
[SPEAKER_20]: They are mostly on the school committee page.

537
00:54:13,399 --> 00:54:16,361
[SPEAKER_20]: So if you go and you search the school committee package, you're able to find it.

538
00:54:16,861 --> 00:54:18,842
[SPEAKER_20]: Person does not need to file a four-year request.

539
00:54:18,862 --> 00:54:23,605
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm happy to share anyone who wants to go through schematic design documents and electrical engineering documents.

540
00:54:24,186 --> 00:54:24,706
[SPEAKER_20]: I welcome it.

541
00:54:25,227 --> 00:54:27,070
[SPEAKER_20]: Maybe they can find some efficiencies.

542
00:54:27,311 --> 00:54:27,711
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

543
00:54:27,731 --> 00:54:29,574
[SPEAKER_16]: I would, and thank you for the answer.

544
00:54:29,855 --> 00:54:30,256
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

545
00:54:30,416 --> 00:54:31,478
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

546
00:54:32,018 --> 00:54:34,943
[SPEAKER_24]: Is your email pcushing at medford.k12.ma.us?

547
00:54:34,963 --> 00:54:35,144
[SPEAKER_24]: It is.

548
00:54:35,184 --> 00:54:35,424
[SPEAKER_24]: All right.

549
00:54:38,815 --> 00:54:44,159
[SPEAKER_24]: Any further public comments, name and address for the record please you have three minutes.

550
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:55,529
[SPEAKER_22]: Nate Merritt, 373 Riverside Ave. I'm sure everyone's aware that, you know, the members of the city residents are maybe a little nervous concern you know upcoming tax hikes and all that, want to make sure that our dollars are spent.

551
00:54:56,525 --> 00:54:57,705
[SPEAKER_22]: most efficiently possible.

552
00:54:58,365 --> 00:55:11,208
[SPEAKER_22]: Was there a course of action given for just say replacement of the existing systems that, you know, replacement parts versus upgrades and it's not clear from the paper, what's an upgrade?

553
00:55:11,748 --> 00:55:23,731
[SPEAKER_22]: Is it, you know, is the roof currently leaking now or is the roof upgrade because of the solar panel installation that's also planned and is that an upgrade versus replacing the parts that are broken for the system?

554
00:55:24,710 --> 00:55:27,235
[SPEAKER_22]: And was there a cost associated with that, like a spectrum?

555
00:55:28,538 --> 00:55:29,560
[SPEAKER_22]: Option A, $5 million.

556
00:55:30,001 --> 00:55:31,484
[SPEAKER_22]: Option B, $15 million.

557
00:55:31,564 --> 00:55:34,550
[SPEAKER_22]: Option C is what we have here, which is what, $25 million?

558
00:55:36,847 --> 00:55:42,389
[SPEAKER_24]: My understanding is a feasibility study was conducted, and I'll leave the specifics to Dr. Cushing.

559
00:55:42,409 --> 00:55:44,449
[SPEAKER_20]: So we recently had an infrared scan.

560
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:47,610
[SPEAKER_20]: We first had a visual inspection of the McGlynn roof completed.

561
00:55:48,371 --> 00:55:50,371
[SPEAKER_20]: We then had an infrared scan.

562
00:55:50,431 --> 00:55:59,534
[SPEAKER_20]: The visual inspection by our roofing contractor who does this work felt that the roof was probably 10% wet, as it's termed.

563
00:56:00,414 --> 00:56:02,315
[SPEAKER_20]: The infrared scan revealed 25% wetness.

564
00:56:04,215 --> 00:56:07,017
[SPEAKER_20]: So the roof needs significant work as well.

565
00:56:07,397 --> 00:56:17,783
[SPEAKER_20]: As part of this project, we examined the costs associated with a full roof replacement, which under the 2011 building code standards would increase the level of insulation.

566
00:56:18,263 --> 00:56:25,607
[SPEAKER_20]: We then had Brenda Pike crunch the numbers on that to see what the cost savings over the 20 year life of the roof would be.

567
00:56:26,207 --> 00:56:28,869
[SPEAKER_20]: And it pales in comparison to the cost of a replacement.

568
00:56:29,289 --> 00:56:32,291
[SPEAKER_20]: What we can do is a refurbishment, a treatment,

569
00:56:33,091 --> 00:56:53,694
[SPEAKER_20]: Similar to what director hunt led about five years ago now, four years ago now at the Andrews Middle School which is called a white knight application, which they go in they repair the wet spots they repair any damage to the roof, and then they put essentially for lack of a better term, a film heavily durable film that has a 20 year warranty on it.

570
00:56:54,575 --> 00:57:02,317
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's what we will more than likely do at the McGlynn at 50% the cost same warranty same lifespan 50% the cost.

571
00:57:03,037 --> 00:57:05,918
[SPEAKER_20]: So, to answer that question on the roof.

572
00:57:06,358 --> 00:57:11,520
[SPEAKER_20]: Also, to speak directly to your question around, you know, could these units be repaired.

573
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:12,940
[SPEAKER_20]: Unfortunately, no.

574
00:57:14,061 --> 00:57:23,430
[SPEAKER_20]: The Environmental Protection Agency has banned the manufacture and importation of the refrigerant that powers these units.

575
00:57:24,051 --> 00:57:27,354
[SPEAKER_20]: The refrigerant that powers these units is R22 refrigerant.

576
00:57:28,035 --> 00:57:29,536
[SPEAKER_20]: It was banned about

577
00:57:30,506 --> 00:57:37,149
[SPEAKER_20]: Four and a half years ago at this point, sorry, I used to be a real academic person and help lift schools out of turnaround.

578
00:57:37,929 --> 00:57:42,211
[SPEAKER_20]: I now know HVAC and other systems which it's just part of what school systems do.

579
00:57:43,472 --> 00:57:45,753
[SPEAKER_20]: So R22 was banned, I think it was during 2020.

580
00:57:46,973 --> 00:57:56,222
[SPEAKER_20]: We did significant work on the Roberts, the Misatoch, and the Brooks in the summer of 2019 to replace a significant amount of compressors.

581
00:57:56,902 --> 00:58:01,827
[SPEAKER_20]: That was funded by a free cash award just prior to my arrival in Medford.

582
00:58:02,907 --> 00:58:07,712
[SPEAKER_20]: These systems operating on R22 would be cost prohibitive

583
00:58:08,132 --> 00:58:17,200
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, the only way to get R-22 is to reclaim it from other units that are being decommissioned or from existing stores.

584
00:58:18,061 --> 00:58:21,124
[SPEAKER_20]: The costs associated with that are exorbitant.

585
00:58:21,704 --> 00:58:24,267
[SPEAKER_20]: I have actually the numbers in a previous school committee report.

586
00:58:24,327 --> 00:58:25,568
[SPEAKER_20]: They're just slipping me right now.

587
00:58:26,108 --> 00:58:44,992
[SPEAKER_20]: So to do any type of repair or upgrade on, I'm sorry, any type of repair or retrofit of these units really kicks the can down the road and leads us to maintaining 23-year-old systems that are unfortunately at the end of their lifespan.

588
00:58:46,613 --> 00:58:46,933
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

589
00:58:50,081 --> 00:58:51,181
[SPEAKER_22]: And to that, that's great.

590
00:58:51,201 --> 00:58:53,242
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think, you know, please don't misunderstand.

591
00:58:53,302 --> 00:59:02,227
[SPEAKER_22]: I want schools to, right, but just saying form fit replacement versus the solar panels that weren't there, that's an upgrade.

592
00:59:02,267 --> 00:59:03,307
[SPEAKER_22]: Is there a dollar cost?

593
00:59:03,387 --> 00:59:05,108
[SPEAKER_22]: How many dollars is that, right?

594
00:59:05,949 --> 00:59:06,789
[SPEAKER_22]: Are there other upgrades?

595
00:59:06,869 --> 00:59:08,170
[SPEAKER_22]: If they make sense, that's great.

596
00:59:08,270 --> 00:59:13,873
[SPEAKER_22]: Just hoping that that cost breakdown for those options has been presented so people can understand the rationale.

597
00:59:14,693 --> 00:59:16,014
[SPEAKER_22]: And if it makes sense to buy, buy.

598
00:59:16,594 --> 00:59:16,994
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

599
00:59:17,675 --> 00:59:17,875
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

600
00:59:19,229 --> 00:59:30,196
[SPEAKER_14]: I will just share that the full feasibility study looks at these sorts of comparisons of various items, but does address the fact that a retrofit is just not possible, really, at this point.

601
00:59:30,776 --> 00:59:35,799
[SPEAKER_14]: An interesting thing with the solar is that we are putting it forward.

602
00:59:35,939 --> 00:59:38,481
[SPEAKER_14]: I am recommending it as an ad alternate on this project.

603
00:59:39,021 --> 00:59:44,805
[SPEAKER_14]: And that is actually because what I have done when we've worked on the last several construction projects, the police, the library, et cetera,

604
00:59:45,525 --> 00:59:58,714
[SPEAKER_14]: When solar is an ad alternate, it comes in at a much lower price than if it was a standalone project, and it comes in surprisingly low, typically because the electrical sub doesn't want to lose the work, and so they give a really good price on that.

605
00:59:59,394 --> 01:00:01,196
[SPEAKER_14]: So we will put it forward as an ad alternate.

606
01:00:01,316 --> 01:00:07,800
[SPEAKER_14]: If it comes in as too pricey or there's some issue with it, then we'll hold that for a later separately funded project.

607
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:15,225
[SPEAKER_14]: If it comes in at a significantly good price, which is in fact what happened with the police and the library, then we would move forward with it.

608
01:00:15,585 --> 01:00:17,566
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just felt that that was useful to know up front.

609
01:00:18,126 --> 01:00:25,868
[SPEAKER_14]: But these are also some of the things that we would get into both in a short committee of the whole, but also in an in-depth one when we are at 100% design.

610
01:00:27,089 --> 01:00:38,212
[SPEAKER_24]: It sounds like it's fair to say that maximizing the lifespan, minimizing the cost, and maximizing the efficiency of this project has been the touchstone of the feasibility study and the design process.

611
01:00:39,013 --> 01:00:39,333
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

612
01:00:40,512 --> 01:00:47,853
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd also like to say that through our meeting since August, we've had to make serious decisions about this project.

613
01:00:48,473 --> 01:01:00,796
[SPEAKER_20]: And the two things guiding our work are energy efficiency, all right, and making sure that we're helping Medford meet its climate goals, but also fiscal responsibility to the taxpayers of the city.

614
01:01:01,496 --> 01:01:06,857
[SPEAKER_20]: We've made conscientious decisions on this project for these two schools.

615
01:01:08,357 --> 01:01:25,715
[SPEAKER_20]: that are fiscally responsible and, you know, sacrifice quicker delivery in some cases and extend the timeline a little bit because of the extraordinarily high cost for that quicker delivery of certain units.

616
01:01:26,456 --> 01:01:26,796
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

617
01:01:27,957 --> 01:01:29,459
[SPEAKER_24]: Seeing no hands on Zoom, we'll go to the podium.

618
01:01:29,699 --> 01:01:30,720
[SPEAKER_24]: Name and address for the record, please.

619
01:01:30,740 --> 01:01:31,401
[SPEAKER_24]: You have three minutes.

620
01:01:32,389 --> 01:01:36,593
[SPEAKER_43]: Hi, my name is Lisa Vienneau and I live at 19 Paul Road in Medford.

621
01:01:37,194 --> 01:01:40,357
[SPEAKER_43]: I was just wondering where this problem has existed for a while.

622
01:01:40,898 --> 01:01:46,143
[SPEAKER_43]: How extensively or creatively have you looked for resources on the

623
01:01:46,877 --> 01:01:57,203
[SPEAKER_43]: federal level, on the private level to fund this or to help fund this project so that it doesn't always just lean on the taxpayer to have to pay it.

624
01:01:57,663 --> 01:02:01,005
[SPEAKER_43]: Just curious where it's been around for at least five years.

625
01:02:01,385 --> 01:02:03,687
[SPEAKER_43]: You've had time to think, oh, perhaps

626
01:02:04,167 --> 01:02:13,374
[SPEAKER_43]: we should look for funding in other places, not just locally in the city, but maybe federal or private.

627
01:02:13,795 --> 01:02:20,140
[SPEAKER_43]: I don't know if construction is considered a way to get funding, but I'm just curious about that.

628
01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:31,048
[SPEAKER_24]: My understanding, and I'm sure Dr. Cushing and Director Hunt can add to it, is that federal money has been used up until this point to fund the process up until this point, the federal ARPA money that came to the city.

629
01:02:32,889 --> 01:02:36,732
[SPEAKER_24]: and there's not really private grants out there for this kind of project.

630
01:02:37,193 --> 01:02:43,597
[SPEAKER_24]: And also I believe it was presented to the school committee that the MSBA was approached and they said that this project wouldn't apply under the MSBA, but.

631
01:02:44,077 --> 01:02:54,365
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think that a full robust answer on this, I would like to defer to the committee of the whole, because I would be happy to go on at length about the difficulty with federal funding where we apply for grants.

632
01:02:54,685 --> 01:02:55,906
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's too much for tonight.

633
01:02:56,246 --> 01:02:59,949
[SPEAKER_14]: Suffice it to say, Brendan and I have been looking at that for two and a half years.

634
01:03:01,650 --> 01:03:10,113
[SPEAKER_14]: The MSBA is not eligible because we are working on a new school, the new high school, and they said we could not fund this project with MSBA.

635
01:03:10,433 --> 01:03:13,154
[SPEAKER_14]: At the same time, we would have to put the new high school on hold.

636
01:03:13,654 --> 01:03:15,475
[SPEAKER_14]: Nobody is willing to put the new high school on hold.

637
01:03:15,815 --> 01:03:18,736
[SPEAKER_14]: Nobody is willing to work in a building without air conditioning.

638
01:03:19,937 --> 01:03:21,859
[SPEAKER_14]: in buildings that were designed for air conditioning.

639
01:03:21,879 --> 01:03:23,280
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's a problem with MSBA.

640
01:03:24,341 --> 01:03:26,243
[SPEAKER_14]: We've looked at smaller grants.

641
01:03:26,623 --> 01:03:33,630
[SPEAKER_14]: When you're looking at a project of this scale, some of the smaller things that are available barely touch this project.

642
01:03:35,687 --> 01:03:39,108
[SPEAKER_20]: So the mass MSBA is the Massachusetts School Building Authority.

643
01:03:39,188 --> 01:03:39,568
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

644
01:03:39,908 --> 01:03:48,671
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's the that's the funding authority that will hopefully fund a large portion of the work that's expected to be done in Medford High School.

645
01:03:49,231 --> 01:03:57,574
[SPEAKER_20]: Also, over the past several years, as everyone is aware, construction costs have spiked excessively.

646
01:03:58,594 --> 01:04:16,438
[SPEAKER_20]: And that actually caused several projects in Massachusetts under MSBA authority to either pause their deployment or to refigure their plans into what's called value engineer, eliminate things as the construction moved forward.

647
01:04:16,938 --> 01:04:24,920
[SPEAKER_20]: MSBA also shut down several of their programs over the last several years to make sure that funding was being driven to the core program.

648
01:04:26,420 --> 01:04:32,663
[SPEAKER_20]: MSBA is considering and I understand will be reopening some accelerated repair projects.

649
01:04:33,383 --> 01:04:39,405
[SPEAKER_20]: That funding would be for over two years from now, which means another two plus heating seasons.

650
01:04:40,906 --> 01:04:47,388
[SPEAKER_20]: And we're considering those for future work with our other schools that are of similar age.

651
01:04:48,028 --> 01:04:52,650
[SPEAKER_20]: The timeline does not fit for these schools where the systems have largely failed.

652
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:55,440
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

653
01:04:56,160 --> 01:05:01,442
[SPEAKER_14]: Tom reminded me that we do anticipate $2.5 million in utility rebates on this project.

654
01:05:01,822 --> 01:05:03,382
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just want to put that out there.

655
01:05:03,883 --> 01:05:04,643
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Director Hunt.

656
01:05:05,903 --> 01:05:07,884
[SPEAKER_24]: Any further questions from members of the Council?

657
01:05:07,924 --> 01:05:12,145
[SPEAKER_24]: Any further comment from members of the public on this item on the loan order for the school HVAC project?

658
01:05:14,826 --> 01:05:21,728
[SPEAKER_24]: Seeing none, on the motion of Vice President Collins, as amended by Councilor Tseng and seconded by Councilor Lazzaro to approve for first reading.

659
01:05:21,908 --> 01:05:22,988
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

660
01:05:25,782 --> 01:05:33,211
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Callahan, Vice President Collins, Councilor Lazzaro, Councilor Leming.

661
01:05:34,153 --> 01:05:34,433
[SPEAKER_35]: Yes.

662
01:05:35,494 --> 01:05:36,215
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Scarpelli.

663
01:05:36,436 --> 01:05:36,616
[SPEAKER_36]: No.

664
01:05:37,697 --> 01:05:38,238
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Tseng.

665
01:05:38,358 --> 01:05:38,999
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes.

666
01:05:39,019 --> 01:05:39,600
[SPEAKER_36]: President Bears.

667
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:39,940
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

668
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:41,182
[SPEAKER_24]: Six in the affirmative, one in the negative.

669
01:05:41,202 --> 01:05:42,043
[SPEAKER_24]: The motion passes.

670
01:05:43,507 --> 01:06:01,080
[SPEAKER_24]: Paper 24 slash five one dash 517 water and sewer capital stabilization fund appropriation request, dear President Bears and members of the city council I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve the following appropriation from the water and sewer capital stabilization fund lead line replacement rebate program.

671
01:06:01,940 --> 01:06:07,763
[SPEAKER_24]: $100,000.

672
01:06:02,180 --> 01:06:07,763
[SPEAKER_24]: As your honorable body knows, the water and sewer capital stabilization fund presently has a balance of $2 million.

673
01:06:08,263 --> 01:06:14,906
[SPEAKER_24]: This was from retained earnings and appropriation from a stabilization account requires a two thirds majority vote of the City Council.

674
01:06:15,366 --> 01:06:18,067
[SPEAKER_24]: DPW Commissioner McGivern is present to answer any questions.

675
01:06:19,048 --> 01:06:20,068
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you for your kind attention.

676
01:06:20,108 --> 01:06:22,549
[SPEAKER_24]: This matter respectfully submitted Mayor Breanna Lungo-Koehn.

677
01:06:23,630 --> 01:06:25,971
[SPEAKER_24]: We have Commissioner McGivern, I believe, on Zoom.

678
01:06:39,667 --> 01:06:41,088
[SPEAKER_24]: Did you make him a co-host, Mr. Quinn?

679
01:06:41,308 --> 01:06:41,508
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

680
01:06:57,359 --> 01:06:58,459
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Commissioner McGibbon.

681
01:06:58,479 --> 01:06:59,520
[SPEAKER_24]: You should be able to unmute.

682
01:06:59,940 --> 01:07:02,582
[SPEAKER_24]: And if you want to share anything about this project before we go to questions.

683
01:07:03,823 --> 01:07:04,163
[SPEAKER_49]: Wonderful.

684
01:07:04,763 --> 01:07:05,343
[SPEAKER_49]: Hello, everybody.

685
01:07:05,823 --> 01:07:08,084
[SPEAKER_49]: Thank you for taking this on tonight.

686
01:07:08,844 --> 01:07:10,064
[SPEAKER_49]: So this is relatively simple.

687
01:07:10,645 --> 01:07:16,506
[SPEAKER_49]: So we are running out of money that we have set aside for our lead line rebate program.

688
01:07:17,466 --> 01:07:21,067
[SPEAKER_49]: And we are trying to actually change that program, how we do it.

689
01:07:21,147 --> 01:07:25,648
[SPEAKER_49]: But we're waiting for some information on a grant that we're trying to get from the EPA.

690
01:07:26,485 --> 01:07:30,047
[SPEAKER_49]: So in the meantime, we need a little bit more money to help that account.

691
01:07:31,248 --> 01:07:32,028
[SPEAKER_49]: And that number is 100,000.

692
01:07:32,468 --> 01:07:39,613
[SPEAKER_49]: So we think that'll hold us over until we know more information on how we're either going to continue this program or change it.

693
01:07:41,774 --> 01:07:44,896
[SPEAKER_49]: I'm happy to answer questions on our plans or whatever comes up.

694
01:07:45,896 --> 01:07:46,116
[SPEAKER_24]: Thanks.

695
01:07:46,156 --> 01:07:47,257
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm going to Vice President Collins.

696
01:07:48,971 --> 01:07:49,691
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Burris.

697
01:07:49,711 --> 01:07:52,412
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Commissioner McGibbon for being with us this evening.

698
01:07:52,432 --> 01:07:58,695
[SPEAKER_18]: I know that the lead line replacement rebate program is something that I've heard a lot about from a lot of constituents.

699
01:07:58,715 --> 01:08:07,578
[SPEAKER_18]: I think there's a lot of enthusiasm for this program as homeowners are really happy to know that there are rebates available for replacing lead lines that really ought to be replaced.

700
01:08:08,138 --> 01:08:09,919
[SPEAKER_18]: So thank you for your work on that program in general.

701
01:08:12,260 --> 01:08:23,448
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that this is a really worthy program and it makes sense to use monies from the Water and Sewer Stabilization Fund, which, you know, is a way of making sure that our retained earnings can remain useful throughout the year to be put towards this.

702
01:08:23,488 --> 01:08:34,436
[SPEAKER_18]: And it sounds to me like it's, you know, essentially just a stopgap, a kind of safety measure until hopefully some federal monies start to augment that program as well.

703
01:08:35,396 --> 01:08:37,258
[SPEAKER_18]: So I would happy to make a motion to approve.

704
01:08:37,598 --> 01:08:37,818
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

705
01:08:39,875 --> 01:08:40,236
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

706
01:08:40,276 --> 01:08:43,221
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion of Councilor Collins to approve, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

707
01:08:43,261 --> 01:08:45,105
[SPEAKER_24]: Any further discussion by members of the Council?

708
01:08:47,830 --> 01:08:50,635
[SPEAKER_24]: Seeing none, is there any discussion by members of the public on the lead line?

709
01:08:50,775 --> 01:08:51,697
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, Councilor Callahan.

710
01:08:53,615 --> 01:09:01,840
[SPEAKER_37]: Real quick, this was something that I have dealt with a lot being a renter, living in a lot of different houses, all of which I led when my child was under six years old.

711
01:09:03,101 --> 01:09:07,283
[SPEAKER_37]: And I do think that it's crucially important.

712
01:09:07,364 --> 01:09:14,048
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm very excited that Medford is incentivizing people and giving people this opportunity to get those fixed and providing a little bit of help with that.

713
01:09:14,708 --> 01:09:17,050
[SPEAKER_37]: I also understand that this is simply

714
01:09:17,850 --> 01:09:21,713
[SPEAKER_37]: putting it in place so that it can be used by the residents.

715
01:09:22,133 --> 01:09:24,215
[SPEAKER_37]: Obviously, that'll depend on how many applications come in.

716
01:09:24,575 --> 01:09:26,237
[SPEAKER_37]: So I'm very happy to support this.

717
01:09:27,157 --> 01:09:27,678
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

718
01:09:27,778 --> 01:09:28,559
[SPEAKER_24]: Any further discussion?

719
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,102
[SPEAKER_24]: Seeing none on the motion of Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

720
01:09:33,122 --> 01:09:34,043
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

721
01:09:34,463 --> 01:09:35,084
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Callahan.

722
01:09:35,904 --> 01:09:36,705
[SPEAKER_36]: Vice President Collins.

723
01:09:37,466 --> 01:09:38,346
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Lazzaro.

724
01:09:38,967 --> 01:09:39,507
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Leming.

725
01:09:39,868 --> 01:09:40,148
[SPEAKER_35]: Yes.

726
01:09:41,048 --> 01:09:41,689
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Scarpelli.

727
01:09:43,157 --> 01:09:44,697
[SPEAKER_36]: I'll just saying president bears.

728
01:09:44,957 --> 01:09:46,378
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, 70 affirmative done the negative.

729
01:09:46,398 --> 01:09:47,298
[SPEAKER_24]: The motion passes.

730
01:09:47,538 --> 01:09:48,478
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Scarpelli.

731
01:09:48,498 --> 01:09:49,338
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

732
01:09:50,339 --> 01:09:54,580
[SPEAKER_29]: Can we hear papers 24-518, 24-519 please.

733
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:59,041
[SPEAKER_24]: While under suspension, Councilor Scarpelli has called papers 24-518 and 24-519.

734
01:09:59,061 --> 01:10:03,342
[SPEAKER_24]: Is there a second?

735
01:10:04,302 --> 01:10:04,662
[SPEAKER_35]: Second.

736
01:10:05,862 --> 01:10:07,083
[SPEAKER_24]: On the second by Councilor Leming.

737
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:08,003
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

738
01:10:17,190 --> 01:10:17,871
[SPEAKER_19]: second.

739
01:10:18,752 --> 01:10:18,972
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah.

740
01:10:19,893 --> 01:10:23,436
[SPEAKER_29]: I didn't say just it's been on the agenda.

741
01:10:30,623 --> 01:10:35,387
[SPEAKER_36]: Council Callahan, Vice President Collins, Councilor Zorro, Councilor Leming.

742
01:10:35,968 --> 01:10:36,248
[SPEAKER_35]: Yes.

743
01:10:37,149 --> 01:10:37,850
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Scarpelli.

744
01:10:38,090 --> 01:10:38,230
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes.

745
01:10:38,769 --> 01:10:40,372
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Tseng, President Bears.

746
01:10:40,612 --> 01:10:43,436
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, having the affirmative, none the negative, the motion passes.

747
01:10:43,456 --> 01:10:49,846
[SPEAKER_24]: 2-4-518, offered by Councilor Scarpelli, be it resolved that the City Administration report back to the Council on the following information.

748
01:10:50,711 --> 01:11:17,094
[SPEAKER_24]: costs associated with terminating the superintendent's contract, any communications, correspondences, meeting minutes, records, and reports regarding the separation, anticipated costs of the superintendent search committee, and interim appointment, be it so resolved that the finance director appear before the council to articulate a plan to restore our dropping bond rating, be it so resolved that the city administration cease and desist the use of private investigators to follow and harass employees, utilizing contractually afforded leave benefits,

749
01:11:17,734 --> 01:11:35,406
[SPEAKER_24]: Be it further resolved in the city administration report back to the council with the identified line in the budget where we are paying private investigators and a complete financial report from the start of this practice to the present and be it resolved at the city administration report to the council, the cost associated for the drug testing of questionable drug testing of our DPW staff and a report outlining the reasons for these tests.

750
01:11:35,947 --> 01:11:40,490
[SPEAKER_24]: Be it further resolved the council request to move to executive session if these issues are confidential.

751
01:11:41,070 --> 01:11:45,994
[SPEAKER_24]: I'll recognize councilor Scarpelli and also note that I do have a response from the mayor which I will read after your presentation.

752
01:11:46,621 --> 01:11:48,001
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Council President.

753
01:11:48,022 --> 01:11:49,862
[SPEAKER_29]: Thanks for allowing this to go forward.

754
01:11:49,922 --> 01:12:05,427
[SPEAKER_29]: I think that as we've spoken about in the past, I think that with the passing of the override, I think every dollar that is going to come through the city coffers I'm going to bring forward because of the lack of transparency.

755
01:12:05,467 --> 01:12:14,631
[SPEAKER_29]: You'll see that there's a trend tonight as we look at different resolutions that lack of transparency or

756
01:12:16,027 --> 01:12:22,651
[SPEAKER_29]: lack of information for our residents to understand the process as we move forward have been a big issue.

757
01:12:23,211 --> 01:12:38,881
[SPEAKER_29]: So I think that understanding phone calls I received as soon as we get the news that the superintendent's contract has just been bought out, and mutually, by the way, I don't know what that means, but when you have someone for a contract,

758
01:12:41,022 --> 01:13:07,931
[SPEAKER_29]: so especially someone that's worked so hard for the community you'd want to see that to the end and i think that not knowing what that that number is that dollar number is and how much these ramifications are going to hit our community i think it's important when you have all these questions about the override and where the money's going where it's truly going and as the mayor said she would have a transparent process i'm just moving this forward to ask that we get a detailed report from the mayor's office

759
01:13:08,612 --> 01:13:11,637
[SPEAKER_29]: And, uh, describing the cost.

760
01:13:12,438 --> 01:13:22,614
[SPEAKER_29]: Um impact that's going to hit this city by paying off a superintendent, um, to go home now and, um.

761
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:36,944
[SPEAKER_29]: collective paycheck to do nothing while we're now moving an assistant superintendent forward an interim role and what that cost will be in the trickle down effect to costs that are going to have to now pick up her slack financially in the city.

762
01:13:37,024 --> 01:13:37,965
[SPEAKER_29]: So, um,

763
01:13:39,005 --> 01:13:39,825
[SPEAKER_29]: This isn't a secret.

764
01:13:41,126 --> 01:13:42,327
[SPEAKER_29]: I hope no one here is offended.

765
01:13:42,987 --> 01:14:02,596
[SPEAKER_29]: I told everybody here I will question every single penny moving forward, especially after the override vote and anything that would be a little questionable when it comes to processes that as soon as the override is passed, we settle a buyout for a superintendent to move her out.

766
01:14:02,676 --> 01:14:06,398
[SPEAKER_29]: So I think that is going to be super important that we have that, Mr. President.

767
01:14:07,339 --> 01:14:10,423
[SPEAKER_29]: So I request that from our administration.

768
01:14:11,024 --> 01:14:20,377
[SPEAKER_29]: The second is I'm glad to hear that Mia did respond back to us about our bond rating for Moody's that people didn't know that

769
01:14:22,091 --> 01:14:34,280
[SPEAKER_29]: we were taken off the bond rating by Moody's, one of our investment companies that give us our bond rating because of some technical issues with filing.

770
01:14:34,780 --> 01:14:39,264
[SPEAKER_29]: I believe I was told, I'm not sure, but I think that we're here that

771
01:14:40,004 --> 01:14:44,008
[SPEAKER_29]: that is back on, we're back on top and our bond rating has been restored.

772
01:14:44,468 --> 01:14:56,179
[SPEAKER_29]: It's also good to know that we truly don't use Moody's too often or if any, when we look at our bonds, but I think it's important that when something goes out, especially when we're talking about what?

773
01:14:56,759 --> 01:14:58,201
[SPEAKER_29]: financial mismanagement, right?

774
01:14:58,801 --> 01:14:59,682
[SPEAKER_29]: And what do we hear?

775
01:14:59,802 --> 01:15:10,612
[SPEAKER_29]: All of a sudden, Moody's has dropped Medford because of A, B and C. So I appreciate the mayor's response today, letting us know that that has been restored.

776
01:15:10,692 --> 01:15:18,079
[SPEAKER_29]: But I would amend this paper, if we could, to ask a report to be presented to the City Council on the reasoning why

777
01:15:18,886 --> 01:15:27,654
[SPEAKER_29]: we would lose a bond rating, because I think that's more alarming in totality to not just getting the bond back.

778
01:15:27,694 --> 01:15:28,815
[SPEAKER_29]: I think, yay, we got it back.

779
01:15:28,855 --> 01:15:33,539
[SPEAKER_29]: But I think what's important, we talk about the issues we had, especially during the time of the override.

780
01:15:33,959 --> 01:15:36,481
[SPEAKER_29]: We talked about mismanagement of our city's finances.

781
01:15:36,521 --> 01:15:44,228
[SPEAKER_29]: So I think that we need to see if we can, Mr. President, to amend the paper to ask for that report.

782
01:15:45,309 --> 01:15:46,190
[SPEAKER_29]: I would appreciate that.

783
01:15:47,951 --> 01:15:49,412
[SPEAKER_29]: Next is to be resolved.

784
01:15:49,432 --> 01:15:53,475
[SPEAKER_29]: The city administration cease and desist the use of private investigators.

785
01:15:53,515 --> 01:16:10,027
[SPEAKER_29]: I was told that we have had multiple employees that under contract are being followed by private investigators, and this is getting to be a real problem because what's happening in our community, whether you want to see it or not,

786
01:16:10,991 --> 01:16:16,033
[SPEAKER_29]: Our community is being divided in so many different levels, and the administration is the catalyst behind this.

787
01:16:16,753 --> 01:16:33,440
[SPEAKER_29]: And we're seeing practices of following hard-working members of our community off of rumors to follow them around the Commonwealth to see if they're doing something wrong during their contractual sick days, and that's wrong.

788
01:16:34,085 --> 01:16:36,446
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm sure everybody here has said and they fight for unions.

789
01:16:36,786 --> 01:16:43,128
[SPEAKER_29]: But if you truly fight for unions, I hope you stand with me to get a true indication of where our tax dollars are going.

790
01:16:43,508 --> 01:16:49,970
[SPEAKER_29]: Because if these rumors again, the reason why we hear the mayor is sent out private investigators because of rumors.

791
01:16:50,730 --> 01:16:56,512
[SPEAKER_29]: And I as one Councilor, if we're going to play that game, I am now responding to rumors.

792
01:16:57,321 --> 01:16:58,723
[SPEAKER_29]: that I want to report back.

793
01:16:58,983 --> 01:17:11,720
[SPEAKER_29]: If this is a practice, I need an update and understand the cost that's attributed to these these, um, these private investigators and where what line item they're coming from and

794
01:17:13,241 --> 01:17:22,367
[SPEAKER_29]: want a full report, what this practice, how much it's cost us from the beginning to the end, and if they have found anything dealing with any private investigators.

795
01:17:22,427 --> 01:17:31,392
[SPEAKER_29]: I know that, you know, we have one DPW member that's now gone, that has settled for a big number, that's, he's home now, counting his money.

796
01:17:31,953 --> 01:17:36,976
[SPEAKER_29]: And I think that was one of the instances that, looking back, I'd love to see what it's cost us.

797
01:17:37,036 --> 01:17:39,117
[SPEAKER_29]: Again, I'm gonna bring it forward.

798
01:17:40,856 --> 01:17:44,738
[SPEAKER_29]: We had an override, $500,000 to fix all of our streets and sidewalks.

799
01:17:45,538 --> 01:17:47,419
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, let's see where this money is going.

800
01:17:47,459 --> 01:17:49,020
[SPEAKER_29]: So I think this is important that we see that.

801
01:17:49,501 --> 01:17:52,562
[SPEAKER_29]: And last but not least, what I heard the other day, I find it appalling.

802
01:17:53,182 --> 01:17:59,726
[SPEAKER_29]: And I think that this is, again, another example of the division of this community.

803
01:18:00,632 --> 01:18:01,592
[SPEAKER_29]: Everybody wants that.

804
01:18:01,632 --> 01:18:02,933
[SPEAKER_29]: What do we have the other day?

805
01:18:02,993 --> 01:18:04,433
[SPEAKER_29]: We have DPW members.

806
01:18:04,914 --> 01:18:09,855
[SPEAKER_29]: We were commending DPW members because of their hard work and their commitment to Medford.

807
01:18:10,395 --> 01:18:24,921
[SPEAKER_29]: But in the same breath, we're gonna hear that in this resolution that just the other day, I was informed that I believe 45 DPW members, staff members were brought in to do drug testing.

808
01:18:27,742 --> 01:18:28,802
[SPEAKER_29]: And that's a blatant

809
01:18:29,482 --> 01:18:30,963
[SPEAKER_29]: blatant problem.

810
01:18:32,063 --> 01:18:35,785
[SPEAKER_29]: So my question that I can ask right now is how much did it cost us?

811
01:18:36,445 --> 01:18:41,227
[SPEAKER_29]: And what do we find with these these these processes?

812
01:18:41,287 --> 01:18:49,451
[SPEAKER_29]: Because I think it's important that we need to know because these members that are here are the people that get up every day and go to work without any question.

813
01:18:49,711 --> 01:18:50,811
[SPEAKER_29]: Now they're understaffed.

814
01:18:51,131 --> 01:18:52,012
[SPEAKER_29]: They're underpaid.

815
01:18:53,266 --> 01:19:01,848
[SPEAKER_29]: These are the people that, remember, we plotted because, what, while everybody was sleeping and doors were shut and everything was buckled down during the pandemic?

816
01:19:02,389 --> 01:19:07,230
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, they were fired, there were police, and there were DPW workers that were killing themselves every single day for this city.

817
01:19:08,270 --> 01:19:15,972
[SPEAKER_29]: So I know the mayor talks about the pandemic, and we want to talk about it when it sounds good, but these men and women, what happened last week, that's a serious problem.

818
01:19:16,432 --> 01:19:21,594
[SPEAKER_29]: And for one member of this leadership team in this city, I think that we have to have

819
01:19:22,558 --> 01:19:23,059
[SPEAKER_29]: emotion.

820
01:19:23,079 --> 01:19:25,742
[SPEAKER_29]: We have to have information that stops this from happening.

821
01:19:26,083 --> 01:19:26,884
[SPEAKER_29]: Enough is enough.

822
01:19:28,245 --> 01:19:29,287
[SPEAKER_29]: Our city is damaged.

823
01:19:29,767 --> 01:19:30,708
[SPEAKER_29]: Our state is damaged.

824
01:19:30,788 --> 01:19:32,030
[SPEAKER_29]: Our nation is damaged as it is.

825
01:19:32,350 --> 01:19:33,252
[SPEAKER_29]: We don't need any more.

826
01:19:35,214 --> 01:19:41,156
[SPEAKER_29]: So I know that there is a representative here from the Teamsters that's represented the union that could explain some important information.

827
01:19:41,536 --> 01:19:44,097
[SPEAKER_29]: And I welcome that when it's time, Council President.

828
01:19:44,457 --> 01:19:48,598
[SPEAKER_29]: But again, I think it's important for this council right now to understand this process.

829
01:19:49,158 --> 01:19:52,899
[SPEAKER_29]: And we all know that, you know, we can't come from the city because of personnel issues.

830
01:19:53,319 --> 01:20:04,643
[SPEAKER_29]: But I will tell you what I can ask for is what the funding what it costs this this community by I believe it was drug testing and alcohol testing, I believe, for

831
01:20:05,783 --> 01:20:23,927
[SPEAKER_29]: all of the city employees that were, by the way, working on our streets, in our schools, in our parks, on our sidewalks, that were called back to the yard, that had to sit in a room and then be embarrassed and disgraced to get drug tested for no reason.

832
01:20:25,007 --> 01:20:26,407
[SPEAKER_29]: So again, Mr. President, thank you.

833
01:20:27,407 --> 01:20:28,228
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

834
01:20:28,248 --> 01:20:34,769
[SPEAKER_24]: I have two documents from the administration that I'll read, and then I'll go to members of the council, and then we can go to public participation.

835
01:20:36,052 --> 01:20:38,854
[SPEAKER_24]: First, I was on the bond rating we received a message from the mayor.

836
01:20:39,935 --> 01:20:44,538
[SPEAKER_24]: Hello President Bears and city council members after a great deal of preparation and bond rating call last week.

837
01:20:45,098 --> 01:20:53,584
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm pleased to report that our a three bond rating was reaffirmed by Moody's financial services company upon receiving updated documentation related to our fiscal year 23 audit.

838
01:20:54,805 --> 01:21:03,247
[SPEAKER_24]: As you're likely aware the AA3 rating is regarded as a quote high grade rating and per Moody's analysis the city is in line for an elevated credit rating in the future.

839
01:21:03,788 --> 01:21:08,949
[SPEAKER_24]: You can read about Moody's outlook on the city's financial health and borrowing strength in a press release on the city website.

840
01:21:09,469 --> 01:21:15,991
[SPEAKER_24]: While this is welcome news it comes with opportunities for us to shore up our financial reporting operations and strive to increase our rating in the future.

841
01:21:16,011 --> 01:21:18,952
[SPEAKER_24]: If you have any questions please feel free to contact my office.

842
01:21:20,196 --> 01:21:26,358
[SPEAKER_24]: We then also received a message regarding Council Resolution 24518, which is what we're currently considering.

843
01:21:27,358 --> 01:21:30,919
[SPEAKER_24]: The mayor said, hello, President Bears, I wanted to provide some insight on Council Resolution 24518.

844
01:21:31,139 --> 01:21:36,160
[SPEAKER_24]: Quote, my responsibility as mayor is to the residents and taxpayers of the city of Medford.

845
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:46,923
[SPEAKER_24]: When I receive allegations from multiple parties alleging various employee matters, including potential misconduct, fraud, et cetera, I believe our community expects that I investigate these allegations to the fullest extent possible.

846
01:21:47,603 --> 01:21:59,825
[SPEAKER_24]: Additionally, depending on the specific nature of the allegations at issue, our human resources department does not have the bandwidth to undertake investigations that are broad in scope or are too cumbersome that such efforts would impede daily office duties and responsibilities.

847
01:22:00,705 --> 01:22:04,486
[SPEAKER_24]: Also, as it relates to school items, please refer all school matters to the school department.

848
01:22:05,066 --> 01:22:13,347
[SPEAKER_24]: With respect to the portion of the proposed resolution pertaining to drug testing, this is a confidential personnel matter and due to individual privacy considerations, we cannot comment.

849
01:22:13,487 --> 01:22:16,828
[SPEAKER_24]: If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.

850
01:22:17,318 --> 01:22:18,499
[SPEAKER_24]: Brianna Lugo, current mayor.

851
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:22,140
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

852
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:26,943
[SPEAKER_24]: Any and if any other Councilors, please, you know, just signal if you'd like to speak.

853
01:22:27,123 --> 01:22:27,883
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Scarpelli.

854
01:22:28,103 --> 01:22:28,463
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

855
01:22:28,603 --> 01:22:37,948
[SPEAKER_29]: So, Clarity, you're saying the mayor says that so to ask for a a report from the school department, is she is she saying that

856
01:22:39,136 --> 01:22:46,337
[SPEAKER_29]: Are we going to get a report financially so we can understand the ramifications financially for buying out the superintendent?

857
01:22:46,357 --> 01:22:49,278
[SPEAKER_29]: I know that you have nothing to do with it, but did she give you any indication?

858
01:22:49,298 --> 01:22:52,298
[SPEAKER_29]: Because to me it sounds like, you know, go pound sand.

859
01:22:52,558 --> 01:22:53,159
[SPEAKER_29]: We're moving on.

860
01:22:53,659 --> 01:22:57,399
[SPEAKER_24]: It says, as it relates to school items, please refer school matters to the school department.

861
01:22:57,819 --> 01:22:59,000
[SPEAKER_24]: That's what the email says.

862
01:22:59,060 --> 01:23:01,500
[SPEAKER_24]: So we can send requests to the school.

863
01:23:01,820 --> 01:23:05,921
[SPEAKER_29]: As the budgetary stewards of this community that vote on that budget,

864
01:23:06,753 --> 01:23:17,142
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm demanding a report, Council President, if you may, to the mayor to break down the financial ramifications of the buyout to the superintendent and what that means to the city.

865
01:23:18,744 --> 01:23:19,084
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

866
01:23:19,604 --> 01:23:19,965
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

867
01:23:20,705 --> 01:23:22,066
[SPEAKER_24]: Any further questions or comments?

868
01:23:22,227 --> 01:23:23,528
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor, Vice President Collins.

869
01:23:25,253 --> 01:23:26,094
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Bears.

870
01:23:26,134 --> 01:23:27,816
[SPEAKER_18]: I appreciate the discussion being put forward.

871
01:23:28,697 --> 01:23:33,842
[SPEAKER_18]: I do wish that these topics were separated into disparate resolutions so we could take them up individually and vote on them individually.

872
01:23:33,862 --> 01:23:39,228
[SPEAKER_18]: A lot to get into here, but I do just feel that we need to

873
01:23:40,569 --> 01:23:42,271
[SPEAKER_18]: be more clear with the language that we're using.

874
01:23:42,871 --> 01:23:49,257
[SPEAKER_18]: And I didn't want people to use, I wouldn't want people to leave the meeting thinking that the city has offered the superintendent a buyout.

875
01:23:49,977 --> 01:23:50,778
[SPEAKER_18]: That's not accurate.

876
01:23:51,018 --> 01:23:53,280
[SPEAKER_18]: It's my understanding again, we are not the school committee.

877
01:23:53,300 --> 01:23:57,183
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't think that we should be taking up matters that are germane to the school committee because that is not our body.

878
01:23:58,164 --> 01:24:12,734
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, but it is my understanding that it is pretty common when a superintendent contract is not renewed that the superintendent does step back from the full extent of their responsibilities before their contract is officially over to allow for that transition.

879
01:24:12,774 --> 01:24:13,774
[SPEAKER_18]: This isn't abnormal.

880
01:24:13,814 --> 01:24:16,816
[SPEAKER_18]: It doesn't indicate that there's any sort of expensive

881
01:24:18,314 --> 01:24:22,275
[SPEAKER_18]: illicit, fraudulent buyout going on, I think that this is normal.

882
01:24:22,436 --> 01:24:23,836
[SPEAKER_18]: So I want to put that out there.

883
01:24:23,856 --> 01:24:33,620
[SPEAKER_18]: I wouldn't, you know, I know that sometimes using these words makes for better TV, but I don't think that it's respectful to the residents to mischaracterize what's going on.

884
01:24:33,780 --> 01:24:34,020
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

885
01:24:35,114 --> 01:24:35,674
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

886
01:24:36,535 --> 01:24:37,916
[SPEAKER_24]: Any further comments from members of the council?

887
01:24:38,596 --> 01:24:39,477
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Scarpelli.

888
01:24:39,697 --> 01:24:39,937
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

889
01:24:39,957 --> 01:24:49,483
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't want to get the tip of tap, but as the mayor just said in her response, when you hear a rumor, she takes up full responsibility to make sure we know what's going on.

890
01:24:50,043 --> 01:25:02,891
[SPEAKER_29]: As fiscal stewards of this community, when the city council, when the school committee mutually ends a contract, and yes, there is a bio with it, there is a financial

891
01:25:03,647 --> 01:25:08,169
[SPEAKER_29]: a financial responsibility to the city by the superintendent leaving early.

892
01:25:08,569 --> 01:25:10,290
[SPEAKER_29]: This is why I'm asking for the resolution.

893
01:25:10,310 --> 01:25:11,391
[SPEAKER_29]: This is why I'm asking the report.

894
01:25:11,971 --> 01:25:12,992
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm not asking for anything bad.

895
01:25:13,032 --> 01:25:14,352
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm not saying anybody did anything wrong.

896
01:25:14,773 --> 01:25:19,495
[SPEAKER_29]: All I'm asking for is a report so we can see what the financial ramifications are

897
01:25:20,655 --> 01:25:25,457
[SPEAKER_29]: by having this buyout, not just with the superintendent, whatever it costs us, if it costs us anything.

898
01:25:25,657 --> 01:25:27,158
[SPEAKER_29]: They come back and say it costs us nothing.

899
01:25:27,718 --> 01:25:30,419
[SPEAKER_29]: But what is it going to cost us for an interim?

900
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:31,620
[SPEAKER_29]: What's that increase?

901
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:33,241
[SPEAKER_29]: What is the trickle-down effect?

902
01:25:33,281 --> 01:25:34,921
[SPEAKER_29]: Who's going to take up those responsibilities?

903
01:25:35,201 --> 01:25:36,942
[SPEAKER_29]: Who's going to pay those people?

904
01:25:37,042 --> 01:25:37,903
[SPEAKER_29]: Are they going to get paid?

905
01:25:38,263 --> 01:25:40,684
[SPEAKER_29]: So I don't think this is something that's very confusing.

906
01:25:41,344 --> 01:25:44,445
[SPEAKER_29]: This, believe me, this is pretty clear.

907
01:25:44,866 --> 01:25:49,528
[SPEAKER_29]: So when I asked for a resolution, the resolution doesn't seem to be too dumbfounding, I believe.

908
01:25:49,568 --> 01:25:51,028
[SPEAKER_29]: I think it's pretty self-explanatory.

909
01:25:51,389 --> 01:26:00,853
[SPEAKER_29]: All this council is asking for, ladies and gentlemen, is just a report on the breakdown of the mutual buyout or the mutual dismissal of the superintendent.

910
01:26:01,093 --> 01:26:01,413
[SPEAKER_29]: That's all.

911
01:26:05,225 --> 01:26:06,446
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm not trying to make this more than it is.

912
01:26:06,486 --> 01:26:10,609
[SPEAKER_24]: I'll go to Councilor Tseng and Councilor Callaghan.

913
01:26:10,709 --> 01:26:11,290
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Tseng.

914
01:26:12,911 --> 01:26:15,133
[SPEAKER_19]: I believe Councilor Callaghan.

915
01:26:15,153 --> 01:26:16,173
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry, I didn't see the order.

916
01:26:16,213 --> 01:26:16,834
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Callaghan.

917
01:26:17,962 --> 01:26:19,482
[SPEAKER_37]: I actually would make a motion to sever.

918
01:26:19,903 --> 01:26:20,963
[SPEAKER_37]: I would sever it into five.

919
01:26:21,203 --> 01:26:26,064
[SPEAKER_37]: Perhaps we can do that after public discussion or whatever before or after either one is fine.

920
01:26:26,504 --> 01:26:34,226
[SPEAKER_37]: But I think there's one that's about the essentially lines two and four, which are the cost of terminating.

921
01:26:34,246 --> 01:26:37,407
[SPEAKER_37]: Then the one in the middle, that line three,

922
01:26:38,207 --> 01:26:39,668
[SPEAKER_37]: Uh inviting all communications.

923
01:26:39,708 --> 01:26:41,609
[SPEAKER_37]: I think that's a a separate one.

924
01:26:42,209 --> 01:26:45,191
[SPEAKER_37]: Um there's a question of the bond rating is a third.

925
01:26:45,651 --> 01:26:50,233
[SPEAKER_37]: The question of the private investigators is the fourth and the question of the drug testing is a fifth.

926
01:26:50,313 --> 01:26:52,614
[SPEAKER_37]: That would be my suggestion to sever it into those five.

927
01:26:53,255 --> 01:26:53,535
[SPEAKER_24]: Thanks.

928
01:26:53,555 --> 01:27:00,318
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, we can take that up when we move to the voting if that's okay so we can hear just since it was presented as one, I think it's fair to hear it as one.

929
01:27:02,557 --> 01:27:02,898
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

930
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:08,486
[SPEAKER_19]: I believe that what is more confusing to me, and I believe I'll...

931
01:27:09,304 --> 01:27:15,306
[SPEAKER_19]: is also confusing to people at home, is using the word buyout for something that I assume is quite contractual.

932
01:27:16,167 --> 01:27:24,170
[SPEAKER_19]: If the criticism, and I understand Councilor Scarpelli is not saying that anyone has necessarily done anything wrong.

933
01:27:24,790 --> 01:27:34,894
[SPEAKER_19]: And, you know, it's always good to have more information, but I do, I think the word is what is confusing, but not the resolution itself.

934
01:27:35,638 --> 01:27:44,005
[SPEAKER_19]: When it comes to the topic of the school superintendent I think it's really important to preface anything by saying that there is a clear separation of powers in the city.

935
01:27:44,726 --> 01:27:45,907
[SPEAKER_19]: When it comes to school governance.

936
01:27:46,788 --> 01:27:49,130
[SPEAKER_19]: However, I understand where the Councilors coming from.

937
01:27:50,971 --> 01:28:07,508
[SPEAKER_19]: I just, I worry that we slip into a logical situation where, you know, this is the standard procedure right, the school board the school committee chooses not to renew something, the contract with the superintendent, and there's a transition period.

938
01:28:07,548 --> 01:28:09,991
[SPEAKER_19]: This is also from my understanding very standard.

939
01:28:10,952 --> 01:28:12,734
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, if we, you know,

940
01:28:13,599 --> 01:28:20,565
[SPEAKER_19]: If the school committee, and that's up to their discretion, doesn't want to renew a contract with the superintendent, this is the process.

941
01:28:20,585 --> 01:28:24,209
[SPEAKER_19]: There isn't any other way that we could do it that would cost less.

942
01:28:25,490 --> 01:28:34,578
[SPEAKER_19]: And if there then becomes criticism that this is how it was done, then we foreclose any accountability we have over a hypothetical superintendent.

943
01:28:35,138 --> 01:28:36,559
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's that.

944
01:28:36,700 --> 01:28:37,620
[SPEAKER_19]: And I haven't decided.

945
01:28:40,103 --> 01:28:43,205
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that's just my logical qualm with it.

946
01:28:43,685 --> 01:28:45,486
[SPEAKER_19]: But I understand the resolution.

947
01:28:45,506 --> 01:28:47,387
[SPEAKER_19]: I understand that it wasn't meant poorly.

948
01:28:49,668 --> 01:28:55,392
[SPEAKER_19]: With regards to, and I'll be brief about everything else because I understand there are folks in the audience who want to talk.

949
01:28:57,513 --> 01:29:06,378
[SPEAKER_19]: I do think it's important that in the administration of the city and how we carry out our duties, I understand the need for accountability.

950
01:29:06,398 --> 01:29:08,679
[SPEAKER_19]: I also understand that we,

951
01:29:09,848 --> 01:29:13,651
[SPEAKER_19]: we have a responsibility to the dignity of our workers as well.

952
01:29:14,091 --> 01:29:22,617
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll keep it simple in that, at that, because I know there are a lot of people here who are looking to give us more information to speak as well.

953
01:29:25,459 --> 01:29:25,820
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

954
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:27,521
[SPEAKER_24]: Any further comment by members of the council?

955
01:29:27,961 --> 01:29:28,902
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Scarpelli.

956
01:29:30,223 --> 01:29:32,685
[SPEAKER_29]: I just think that, I think I'll say it again.

957
01:29:32,725 --> 01:29:37,448
[SPEAKER_29]: And I, and I, for what this community has just gone through in November,

958
01:29:38,331 --> 01:29:43,613
[SPEAKER_29]: I think it's important that we do question everything because everybody's asking.

959
01:29:44,873 --> 01:29:52,996
[SPEAKER_29]: So either it's on the city side, school side, it comes, it's coming out of our city's budget and there are questions that aren't being asked.

960
01:29:53,537 --> 01:30:00,779
[SPEAKER_29]: So when residents come to me and say, what are the implications financially, especially after an override, it just doesn't smell right.

961
01:30:01,199 --> 01:30:05,221
[SPEAKER_29]: That's why I'm saying these are the, these are the important things that all that is, is just,

962
01:30:05,968 --> 01:30:08,830
[SPEAKER_29]: showing the information, understanding the information moving forward.

963
01:30:09,490 --> 01:30:14,933
[SPEAKER_29]: So when we talk about accountability, don't you think it's about time that the mayor is held accountable?

964
01:30:14,953 --> 01:30:19,055
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, don't we think that this administration is held accountable?

965
01:30:19,696 --> 01:30:20,676
[SPEAKER_29]: This is the problem.

966
01:30:21,857 --> 01:30:27,200
[SPEAKER_29]: So she's getting a free pass by hiding behind different levels.

967
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:29,862
[SPEAKER_29]: And the bottom line is enough is enough.

968
01:30:29,942 --> 01:30:31,222
[SPEAKER_29]: We need to fix this community.

969
01:30:31,643 --> 01:30:32,123
[SPEAKER_29]: So thank you.

970
01:30:34,540 --> 01:30:36,101
[SPEAKER_24]: Any further discussion by members of the council?

971
01:30:37,222 --> 01:30:39,284
[SPEAKER_24]: Seeing none, we'll go to public participation on this item.

972
01:30:40,185 --> 01:30:43,268
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll take alternating public participation at the podium and on Zoom.

973
01:30:43,328 --> 01:30:45,310
[SPEAKER_24]: Please raise your hand on Zoom if you'd like to participate.

974
01:30:45,890 --> 01:30:46,771
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll start at the podium.

975
01:30:46,831 --> 01:30:47,912
[SPEAKER_24]: Name and address for the record, please.

976
01:30:47,932 --> 01:30:48,573
[SPEAKER_24]: You have three minutes.

977
01:30:53,717 --> 01:30:56,440
[SPEAKER_24]: It's all one item, so whichever items were included in that

978
01:31:00,575 --> 01:31:01,075
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening.

979
01:31:02,035 --> 01:31:04,876
[SPEAKER_11]: My name is Nancy Campbell, 544 Main Street.

980
01:31:05,416 --> 01:31:08,177
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a field representative with the Teamsters Local 25.

981
01:31:09,177 --> 01:31:14,278
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm one of three agents assigned to represent the City of Medford Union employees.

982
01:31:15,518 --> 01:31:23,700
[SPEAKER_11]: We're here today because this past week, the mayor singled out our DPW workers, violating their rights, and broke the law again.

983
01:31:24,710 --> 01:31:32,233
[SPEAKER_11]: This time the mayor demanded that 28 of our DPW members, almost the entire bargaining unit, take a mandatory drug test.

984
01:31:33,053 --> 01:31:38,935
[SPEAKER_11]: The 28 DPW members were lined up outside in broad daylight for all the world to see.

985
01:31:39,395 --> 01:31:43,797
[SPEAKER_11]: One by one, they were loaded into the back of a drug testing van like criminals.

986
01:31:44,844 --> 01:31:54,687
[SPEAKER_11]: They were forced to sign away their rights, a violation of mass DOT regulations, and then they were told to pee in a cup with a stranger peering over their shoulder.

987
01:31:55,408 --> 01:32:04,971
[SPEAKER_11]: The stranger took each test in rapid succession with so much as non-sanitizing his hands between each.

988
01:32:06,592 --> 01:32:09,372
[SPEAKER_11]: This sort of mass drug testing is unheard of.

989
01:32:10,473 --> 01:32:13,694
[SPEAKER_11]: It was humiliating, inhumane, and illegal.

990
01:32:15,359 --> 01:32:25,183
[SPEAKER_11]: To be clear, there was absolutely no just cause or reasonable suspicion for any of these members to be tested, let alone all 28 of them at once.

991
01:32:26,243 --> 01:32:35,967
[SPEAKER_11]: By the mayor's own account, a single unused needle found in the bathroom on Monday morning justified the mass testing.

992
01:32:36,667 --> 01:32:38,468
[SPEAKER_11]: But let's call a spade a spade here.

993
01:32:39,048 --> 01:32:40,649
[SPEAKER_11]: The bathroom where the needle was found

994
01:32:41,946 --> 01:32:45,888
[SPEAKER_11]: wasn't only used by DPW workers.

995
01:32:46,228 --> 01:32:49,330
[SPEAKER_11]: It was used by the public and other city employees.

996
01:32:49,870 --> 01:32:54,132
[SPEAKER_11]: So why then were only DPW workers singled out?

997
01:32:54,913 --> 01:32:59,155
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure the mayor will be scrambling around to come up with a good answer for that one.

998
01:33:00,155 --> 01:33:11,341
[SPEAKER_11]: The mayor's despicable actions last week demonstrated poor leadership, bad judgment, and a failed labor relation policy that has become typical for her administration.

999
01:33:12,517 --> 01:33:22,881
[SPEAKER_11]: but that serves absolutely no one but the management attorneys who line their pockets with taxpayer dollars defending the mayor's unlawful actions.

1000
01:33:24,022 --> 01:33:37,367
[SPEAKER_11]: In one fell swoop, the mayor managed to violate the collective bargaining agreement, state labor law, DOT regulations, the city's own drug policy, and most importantly, the U.S.

1001
01:33:37,427 --> 01:33:38,248
[SPEAKER_11]: Constitution.

1002
01:33:39,128 --> 01:33:44,371
[SPEAKER_11]: The Fourth Amendment protects all citizens from unreasonable government search and seizure.

1003
01:33:45,211 --> 01:33:55,177
[SPEAKER_11]: If a police officer wants to give somebody a breathalyzer to see whether they have been drinking and driving, they need probable cause, reasonable suspicion.

1004
01:33:55,617 --> 01:33:59,359
[SPEAKER_11]: They can't just shove a tube down their throat because they feel like it.

1005
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:07,344
[SPEAKER_11]: And they certainly can't start pulling over random passerby after finding a single beer can on the side of the road.

1006
01:34:08,277 --> 01:34:11,879
[SPEAKER_11]: Yet here in MedFed, that effectively is exactly what happened.

1007
01:34:12,680 --> 01:34:24,167
[SPEAKER_11]: Without reasonable bias whatsoever, upon finding a single unused needle in a public bathroom, the mayor subjected 28 city employees to drug tests.

1008
01:34:24,528 --> 01:34:24,868
[SPEAKER_11]: Why?

1009
01:34:25,528 --> 01:34:26,569
[SPEAKER_11]: Because she felt like it.

1010
01:34:28,439 --> 01:34:34,503
[SPEAKER_11]: She did not have any reason or evidence to suspect that any of the needles belonging to any one of them.

1011
01:34:34,983 --> 01:34:43,209
[SPEAKER_11]: So it should come as no surprise that the drug test results show that every single tested employee passed.

1012
01:34:44,149 --> 01:34:45,570
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, I wanna be clear.

1013
01:34:46,231 --> 01:34:52,475
[SPEAKER_11]: Every single employee who was tested passed not only a drug test, but also a breathalyzer.

1014
01:34:52,995 --> 01:34:55,477
[SPEAKER_11]: Not one of our members showed up to work

1015
01:34:55,877 --> 01:34:58,059
[SPEAKER_11]: under the influence of drug or alcohol.

1016
01:34:58,860 --> 01:35:01,962
[SPEAKER_11]: Here in Medford, you have a mayor who thinks she is above the law.

1017
01:35:02,262 --> 01:35:06,646
[SPEAKER_11]: You have a mayor who thinks the US Constitution means absolutely nothing.

1018
01:35:06,806 --> 01:35:07,507
[SPEAKER_24]: You have one minute.

1019
01:35:08,325 --> 01:35:16,588
[SPEAKER_11]: The mayor, an attorney by trade, feels as though these employees, citizens of Medford, should not be afforded the same rights as all Americans.

1020
01:35:17,188 --> 01:35:32,354
[SPEAKER_11]: But to our members, who were the ones subjected to the embarrassment of being forced to take these invasive tests against their will or lose their job in the face of embarrassment of residents thinking that these hardworking men

1021
01:35:33,234 --> 01:35:37,957
[SPEAKER_11]: dedicated in keeping your city street running safely are using drugs at work.

1022
01:35:38,438 --> 01:35:48,444
[SPEAKER_11]: Under the mayor's tenure, the city has already spent hundreds of thousands of dollars fighting unions across the city rather than giving them fair wage adjustment and benefits.

1023
01:35:48,604 --> 01:35:49,605
[SPEAKER_11]: The message is clear.

1024
01:35:49,905 --> 01:35:54,368
[SPEAKER_11]: The mayor would rather spend your money fighting her employees than supporting them.

1025
01:35:54,829 --> 01:36:00,853
[SPEAKER_11]: The council spends time talking about the council, the mayor, the school committee raises, but no one

1026
01:36:01,593 --> 01:36:06,937
[SPEAKER_11]: No one discusses the regular employees like police, fire, dispatchers, Teamster employees.

1027
01:36:07,037 --> 01:36:07,397
[SPEAKER_11]: Why?

1028
01:36:08,077 --> 01:36:12,901
[SPEAKER_11]: She got three raises this year, but she doesn't think they deserve one.

1029
01:36:13,061 --> 01:36:13,421
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1030
01:36:13,481 --> 01:36:14,081
[SPEAKER_24]: That's time.

1031
01:36:14,101 --> 01:36:15,322
[SPEAKER_24]: And we went two minutes over.

1032
01:36:15,362 --> 01:36:17,564
[SPEAKER_11]: Lastly, we are calling on the mayor.

1033
01:36:19,407 --> 01:36:22,691
[SPEAKER_24]: I'll let her finish her sentence, but I just want you to acknowledge the time.

1034
01:36:22,731 --> 01:36:23,091
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1035
01:36:23,111 --> 01:36:24,312
[SPEAKER_11]: Finish the sentence.

1036
01:36:24,332 --> 01:36:24,552
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1037
01:36:24,572 --> 01:36:25,333
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to finish.

1038
01:36:26,334 --> 01:36:29,037
[SPEAKER_11]: Excuse me.

1039
01:36:29,237 --> 01:36:39,507
[SPEAKER_11]: The city has paid another many hundreds of thousands of dollars to employees throughout the city for mass wage violations, as well as employment lawsuits.

1040
01:36:41,147 --> 01:36:44,569
[SPEAKER_11]: What are you doing as city councils waiting for?

1041
01:36:44,849 --> 01:36:53,653
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you waiting for additional civil rights lawsuits like the one that was just filed today or more wage violations so the city finally goes into bankruptcy?

1042
01:36:54,409 --> 01:36:57,671
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I can assure you that is exactly the direction you're headed in.

1043
01:36:58,291 --> 01:37:14,881
[SPEAKER_11]: You have asked the residents of this great city for overrides under the guise of keeping their schools properly staffed, but also while paying for her constant and deliberate mishandling of their money for attorney fees lawsuit settlement and wage violations.

1044
01:37:15,541 --> 01:37:28,112
[SPEAKER_11]: If the city was being properly managed by a competent mayor, instead of a mayor playing favoritism and using city funds to finance her personal vendettas against her employees, you wouldn't need any overrides.

1045
01:37:28,913 --> 01:37:38,261
[SPEAKER_11]: When will you start doing your jobs that you were elected to do and protect the resident and employees from this constant harassment and mistreatment from the mayor?

1046
01:37:38,641 --> 01:37:48,204
[SPEAKER_11]: I urge all of you to take a step back and reassess if you're really stepping up to the plate and doing the very best you can as elected city councilors.

1047
01:37:48,724 --> 01:37:52,065
[SPEAKER_11]: I wanna urge the residents here in Medford to start doing the same.

1048
01:37:52,405 --> 01:38:03,829
[SPEAKER_11]: Is the mayor doing the job you elected her to do by wasting your hard earned money on attorney fees, private investigators, unlawful drug testing to settle personal scores of the employees?

1049
01:38:04,329 --> 01:38:07,150
[SPEAKER_11]: Wake up everybody and start paying attention.

1050
01:38:07,990 --> 01:38:15,857
[SPEAKER_11]: and put a stop to this once and for all because we will not stop fighting to protect our members, their rights, their jobs and their dignities.

1051
01:38:16,438 --> 01:38:25,306
[SPEAKER_11]: Lastly, we are calling on the mayor to take a urine drug test in the front parking lot of the DPW in an unsanitary van.

1052
01:38:26,874 --> 01:38:44,884
[SPEAKER_11]: with the door wide open, with a line of people outside watching, which is exactly the humiliating conditions our members, your hardworking DPW employees, were mandated to in the last test on Monday, as a condition of their employment, by the way.

1053
01:38:45,445 --> 01:38:51,208
[SPEAKER_11]: And if she refuses, she should face the same repercussions they were threatened with.

1054
01:38:51,608 --> 01:38:52,829
[SPEAKER_11]: She should be fired.

1055
01:38:54,599 --> 01:38:54,999
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1056
01:38:55,039 --> 01:38:57,761
[SPEAKER_24]: I just want to acknowledge, I know you were speaking for a number of people.

1057
01:38:58,202 --> 01:38:58,922
[SPEAKER_24]: We do have rules.

1058
01:38:59,002 --> 01:39:01,704
[SPEAKER_24]: I did extensively go beyond those rules to hear the comment.

1059
01:39:02,064 --> 01:39:04,286
[SPEAKER_24]: That's going to be the one time that I do that tonight on this matter.

1060
01:39:04,686 --> 01:39:07,949
[SPEAKER_24]: If there are other people who would like to speak, there'll be a three minute time limit.

1061
01:39:09,350 --> 01:39:11,171
[SPEAKER_23]: Brian Hatch, Local 25 Teamsters.

1062
01:39:11,191 --> 01:39:11,752
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1063
01:39:11,772 --> 01:39:12,492
[SPEAKER_24]: You have three minutes.

1064
01:39:13,313 --> 01:39:19,917
[SPEAKER_23]: I have eight copies of a lawsuit filed today in US District Court against the Mayor and the HR Director by our members at the DPW.

1065
01:39:20,778 --> 01:39:21,879
[SPEAKER_23]: I'll give you those copies.

1066
01:39:22,827 --> 01:39:26,088
[SPEAKER_23]: Teamsters Local 25 represents over 14 communities.

1067
01:39:26,988 --> 01:39:33,549
[SPEAKER_23]: We have never seen such an egregious act and disregard of a member's rights and dignity.

1068
01:39:34,789 --> 01:39:35,710
[SPEAKER_23]: I'll leave it at that.

1069
01:39:36,450 --> 01:39:38,990
[SPEAKER_23]: Here's your lawsuits from the members.

1070
01:39:39,610 --> 01:39:40,891
[SPEAKER_23]: Right here, there's eight copies.

1071
01:39:41,151 --> 01:39:41,531
[SPEAKER_23]: Read them.

1072
01:39:42,451 --> 01:39:42,811
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1073
01:39:43,071 --> 01:39:44,591
[SPEAKER_24]: If you could place them on that desk over there.

1074
01:39:44,671 --> 01:39:45,792
[SPEAKER_23]: You can place them on the desk.

1075
01:39:45,812 --> 01:39:46,432
[SPEAKER_23]: Wish you the best.

1076
01:39:46,452 --> 01:39:48,092
[SPEAKER_24]: If you could please place them on the desk over there.

1077
01:39:48,372 --> 01:39:48,792
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1078
01:39:49,392 --> 01:39:52,213
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor, you can place them on the desk over there.

1079
01:39:52,373 --> 01:39:52,633
[SPEAKER_24]: Thanks.

1080
01:39:56,442 --> 01:39:57,003
[SPEAKER_24]: Sure.

1081
01:39:57,763 --> 01:39:59,684
[SPEAKER_24]: Do we have any other public participation on the matter?

1082
01:40:03,645 --> 01:40:04,585
[SPEAKER_24]: Seeing none on Zoom.

1083
01:40:05,306 --> 01:40:05,666
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

1084
01:40:07,106 --> 01:40:08,427
[SPEAKER_24]: Name and address for the record, you have three minutes.

1085
01:40:08,527 --> 01:40:11,068
[SPEAKER_07]: John Flagg, 55 Garfield Ave, Medford.

1086
01:40:11,508 --> 01:40:15,409
[SPEAKER_07]: Through the chair, I'd like to know what the councilors think about the mayor's actions.

1087
01:40:17,650 --> 01:40:19,271
[SPEAKER_07]: Did anybody have a comment on this?

1088
01:40:20,311 --> 01:40:22,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Forcing people to take drug tests on rumors?

1089
01:40:27,662 --> 01:40:28,722
[SPEAKER_07]: Zach, got anything?

1090
01:40:29,303 --> 01:40:30,963
[SPEAKER_24]: You have your time, I'm waiting for you to.

1091
01:40:30,983 --> 01:40:34,025
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't need three minutes, I asked a question, anybody gonna answer it?

1092
01:40:34,145 --> 01:40:36,226
[SPEAKER_24]: You are allowed to make a public comment, thank you.

1093
01:40:38,287 --> 01:40:42,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Public comment means asking a representative questions.

1094
01:40:42,228 --> 01:40:44,789
[SPEAKER_24]: No, it doesn't, it means that you have three minutes to share your perspective.

1095
01:40:44,809 --> 01:40:45,930
[SPEAKER_07]: You can make up any rules you want.

1096
01:40:45,950 --> 01:40:47,210
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, it's not made up.

1097
01:40:49,872 --> 01:40:50,852
[SPEAKER_24]: Any further public comment?

1098
01:40:56,263 --> 01:40:57,483
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, you relinquished the chair.

1099
01:40:59,224 --> 01:41:00,744
[SPEAKER_24]: You relinquished the podium.

1100
01:41:02,885 --> 01:41:04,106
[SPEAKER_24]: You relinquished the podium.

1101
01:41:04,646 --> 01:41:06,006
[SPEAKER_24]: You walked away from the podium.

1102
01:41:06,046 --> 01:41:09,147
[SPEAKER_24]: If you'd like to speak again, you can speak after anyone else who'd like to speak.

1103
01:41:09,687 --> 01:41:10,268
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1104
01:41:10,808 --> 01:41:11,408
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1105
01:41:12,288 --> 01:41:13,209
[SPEAKER_24]: Please follow the rules.

1106
01:41:13,389 --> 01:41:15,849
[SPEAKER_24]: It's how we maintain decorum and have civil discussion.

1107
01:41:15,869 --> 01:41:21,551
[SPEAKER_24]: It's fun, right?

1108
01:41:21,571 --> 01:41:21,831
[SPEAKER_24]: So fun.

1109
01:41:24,073 --> 01:41:25,374
[SPEAKER_24]: Any further public comment.

1110
01:41:25,934 --> 01:41:27,795
[SPEAKER_24]: Any further public comment we'd like to have here.

1111
01:41:34,757 --> 01:41:38,319
[SPEAKER_00]: Reno 158 Concord road, thank you have three minutes, you know, I

1112
01:41:39,975 --> 01:41:47,377
[SPEAKER_00]: I too have a problem with this I've never seen anything like this with my 28 years and the team says local 25 to sit there and be embarrassed.

1113
01:41:47,837 --> 01:41:58,419
[SPEAKER_00]: Have these hard workers essential workers who busted their butts to coven any problems that were thrown their way, as well as the fire department, and the police department as well.

1114
01:41:58,859 --> 01:42:00,640
[SPEAKER_00]: And for you to sit up there and think it's funny.

1115
01:42:01,460 --> 01:42:03,001
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I kind of resent that.

1116
01:42:03,021 --> 01:42:03,922
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think this is funny at all.

1117
01:42:03,982 --> 01:42:05,263
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think people should be disrespected.

1118
01:42:05,303 --> 01:42:06,264
[SPEAKER_00]: Rad, rad, rad, that's not funny.

1119
01:42:06,284 --> 01:42:07,505
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what just came out of the crowd.

1120
01:42:07,725 --> 01:42:08,726
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what just came out of the crowd.

1121
01:42:08,786 --> 01:42:13,390
[SPEAKER_00]: Our problem is, you know, these workers were treated unfair, unjust.

1122
01:42:14,070 --> 01:42:18,334
[SPEAKER_00]: It's embarrassing to be sit there and lined up like they're criminals.

1123
01:42:18,374 --> 01:42:23,098
[SPEAKER_00]: They come to work every day and they work a hard day's work for a hard day's wage.

1124
01:42:24,379 --> 01:42:29,663
[SPEAKER_00]: They showed up every day and to be treated because they, because the mayor heard a rumor,

1125
01:42:30,529 --> 01:42:31,989
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what goes on?

1126
01:42:32,309 --> 01:42:41,311
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have taken that $7,500 or $8,000 it costs to do those tests and gave it to the schools to start the HVAC program.

1127
01:42:43,091 --> 01:42:46,572
[SPEAKER_00]: Gentlemen said about watching where every penny goes through this city.

1128
01:42:47,652 --> 01:42:57,454
[SPEAKER_00]: It's embarrassing to have these guys stand up and have to go one by one in a band and then have to get up here and to fight for their jobs.

1129
01:42:58,285 --> 01:43:07,096
[SPEAKER_00]: and they don't take that drug test, they lose their job immediately, I find it very uneasy.

1130
01:43:07,817 --> 01:43:13,805
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ask the members of this council, does that seem right?

1131
01:43:15,327 --> 01:43:16,408
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were asked today,

1132
01:43:17,366 --> 01:43:28,672
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, all five of you or seven of you to sit there and one by one go up and have to take a drug test in front of your coworkers and everybody in the public's eye.

1133
01:43:30,453 --> 01:43:32,954
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very serious issue.

1134
01:43:33,614 --> 01:43:41,839
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully the council will sit there and act appropriately and come to this resolution so it never happens again.

1135
01:43:42,999 --> 01:43:44,300
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unconstitutional.

1136
01:43:45,100 --> 01:43:46,401
[SPEAKER_00]: It's against their contract.

1137
01:43:47,684 --> 01:43:49,805
[SPEAKER_00]: It's against the American way of life.

1138
01:43:49,905 --> 01:43:53,227
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like being treated like a piece of dirt on the ground.

1139
01:43:53,947 --> 01:44:00,450
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys show up day after day, every day, and they do their job to make this city better.

1140
01:44:01,830 --> 01:44:12,475
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really don't think that our mayor here in this town is standing up for what the people voted her in for, spending money relentlessly, ridiculously.

1141
01:44:13,632 --> 01:44:16,374
[SPEAKER_00]: There's issues that have to be dealt with in this city.

1142
01:44:16,674 --> 01:44:24,320
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really don't think putting 28 guys in the middle of a van to take a drug test and a breathalyzer is one of them.

1143
01:44:24,761 --> 01:44:25,721
[SPEAKER_24]: You have 30 more seconds.

1144
01:44:25,741 --> 01:44:27,163
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 more seconds.

1145
01:44:27,243 --> 01:44:28,263
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for listening to me.

1146
01:44:28,283 --> 01:44:28,684
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1147
01:44:28,964 --> 01:44:32,547
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm gonna just reiterate how the process works here.

1148
01:44:34,614 --> 01:44:39,677
[SPEAKER_24]: What has been described is not something that I would be comfortable with as a person, my role as the chairs.

1149
01:44:40,297 --> 01:44:50,924
[SPEAKER_24]: I shouldn't even be saying what I'm saying right now, till we've heard from the public till we've heard from all the Councilors until we that's that's the rules of this process are here, so that we can hear from the members of the Council I'm chairing the meeting.

1150
01:44:51,304 --> 01:44:54,569
[SPEAKER_24]: We can hear from members of the public under the rules, and then we can make comments.

1151
01:44:54,990 --> 01:44:56,893
[SPEAKER_24]: We've heard a case has been made.

1152
01:44:57,654 --> 01:45:03,203
[SPEAKER_24]: Folks have had an experience and said they had an experience that they felt very uncomfortable and felt was unjust.

1153
01:45:03,584 --> 01:45:04,245
[SPEAKER_24]: We've heard that.

1154
01:45:04,645 --> 01:45:06,148
[SPEAKER_24]: We have a short response from the mayor.

1155
01:45:07,429 --> 01:45:11,652
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm going to guess that most of the people behind this rail would like to learn more about what happened.

1156
01:45:12,252 --> 01:45:19,537
[SPEAKER_24]: And also just to be honest and direct, our role in this process is we do not, I am not the boss of any employee in the city.

1157
01:45:19,617 --> 01:45:27,022
[SPEAKER_24]: No one behind this rail is the manager of any employee in the city, except for this person right next to us is the only person in the city who works for the city council.

1158
01:45:27,562 --> 01:45:34,427
[SPEAKER_24]: Everybody else who works for the city of Medford works for the mayor of Medford or the superintendent of schools of the Medford public schools.

1159
01:45:34,927 --> 01:45:36,268
[SPEAKER_24]: So that's the role that we play here.

1160
01:45:38,010 --> 01:45:45,558
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sure many of us would feel dismayed and feel that the experience that was described by the representative was not something that they would want to go through.

1161
01:45:45,578 --> 01:45:48,262
[SPEAKER_24]: I think everyone in the crowd would probably say the same.

1162
01:45:49,022 --> 01:45:50,744
[SPEAKER_24]: Now the rest of the facts that come out of that.

1163
01:45:51,724 --> 01:45:52,945
[SPEAKER_24]: We don't know all the answers.

1164
01:45:52,985 --> 01:45:55,367
[SPEAKER_24]: We just have what has been presented so far.

1165
01:45:55,908 --> 01:46:00,332
[SPEAKER_24]: And our action simply would be to say, we do not like that you did that mayor.

1166
01:46:00,452 --> 01:46:04,735
[SPEAKER_24]: When we talk about accountability for the mayor, that happens at the ballot box every two years.

1167
01:46:05,376 --> 01:46:07,778
[SPEAKER_24]: And that is how she's held accountable.

1168
01:46:08,959 --> 01:46:17,627
[SPEAKER_24]: Beyond that, there is nothing in the city charter, the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, federal law that empowers this council to order the mayor to not do what she did.

1169
01:46:18,992 --> 01:46:25,012
[SPEAKER_24]: The union has filed a suit, as is their right, on behalf of their members, disputing what happened.

1170
01:46:26,218 --> 01:46:27,299
[SPEAKER_24]: Individuals filed the suit.

1171
01:46:27,339 --> 01:46:27,659
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1172
01:46:27,679 --> 01:46:29,461
[SPEAKER_24]: Then the individuals filed the suit themselves.

1173
01:46:29,501 --> 01:46:29,821
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1174
01:46:29,841 --> 01:46:31,782
[SPEAKER_24]: And the representative presented it.

1175
01:46:31,822 --> 01:46:35,485
[SPEAKER_24]: I assumed that Teamsters Local 25 represented, but the members have filed suit.

1176
01:46:36,026 --> 01:46:36,666
[SPEAKER_24]: That's their right.

1177
01:46:37,146 --> 01:46:39,849
[SPEAKER_24]: Beyond that, their recourse is we can hear facts here.

1178
01:46:39,889 --> 01:46:41,190
[SPEAKER_24]: We can hear statements made here.

1179
01:46:41,630 --> 01:46:49,136
[SPEAKER_24]: People can speak at the podium and the Councilors can look for additional information, but that's why we're having the discussion that we're having.

1180
01:46:50,277 --> 01:46:52,819
[SPEAKER_24]: And no one behind the rail is obligated at this point to say,

1181
01:46:53,672 --> 01:47:12,445
[SPEAKER_24]: their opinion, whether they feel like they have enough information to make an informed discussion, all I can say is that the experience that was described is not something I would want to experience, and I'm sure we all would like to find out more information about why it happened and to make sure that whatever recourse is available to the people who experienced it is there.

1182
01:47:13,726 --> 01:47:14,166
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1183
01:47:14,226 --> 01:47:22,689
[SPEAKER_24]: And one of the reasons that we have rules is so that we maintain decorum and that I can explain the process and what this council has the power to do and not do.

1184
01:47:23,249 --> 01:47:24,089
[SPEAKER_24]: So I appreciate that.

1185
01:47:25,969 --> 01:47:28,430
[SPEAKER_24]: I'll go to Zoom and then we'll come back to the podium.

1186
01:47:29,070 --> 01:47:30,371
[SPEAKER_24]: On Zoom, we have Nadeen.

1187
01:47:30,411 --> 01:47:31,791
[SPEAKER_24]: Name and address for the record, please.

1188
01:47:31,831 --> 01:47:32,631
[SPEAKER_24]: You have three minutes.

1189
01:47:41,754 --> 01:47:42,394
[SPEAKER_42]: Hi, can you hear me?

1190
01:47:44,991 --> 01:47:45,892
[SPEAKER_42]: Oh, hello?

1191
01:47:48,574 --> 01:47:49,415
[SPEAKER_24]: Nadeen, we can hear you.

1192
01:47:49,455 --> 01:47:50,676
[SPEAKER_24]: Name and address for the record, please.

1193
01:47:51,176 --> 01:47:51,716
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay, great.

1194
01:47:51,897 --> 01:47:53,398
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you, Nadeen Moretti, Birgit Av.

1195
01:47:53,418 --> 01:47:56,180
[SPEAKER_42]: I just want to say something brief.

1196
01:47:56,941 --> 01:48:06,769
[SPEAKER_42]: Of course, what's going on is just disgusting, and it just seems to always compound with every week, every meeting, every issue.

1197
01:48:07,830 --> 01:48:11,873
[SPEAKER_42]: What I do want to point out, though, the level of maturity that is missing

1198
01:48:13,317 --> 01:48:20,424
[SPEAKER_42]: oftentimes from the response with people that are behind the podium or that come up to the podium to speak, it's just, it's unthinkable.

1199
01:48:20,484 --> 01:48:36,580
[SPEAKER_42]: I just can't get over the response sometimes, the laughing, you know, not from every single council member, but I just don't think it's appropriate when you have people that have deep, real feelings what's going on and people are upset and we're constantly upset coming to this council.

1200
01:48:36,660 --> 01:48:37,821
[SPEAKER_42]: That's all we ever are.

1201
01:48:39,455 --> 01:48:40,476
[SPEAKER_42]: I just don't think it's right.

1202
01:48:40,516 --> 01:48:46,558
[SPEAKER_42]: I think it's very unbecoming of what a council, I'm not talking about everybody, I'm talking about one person right now, should act.

1203
01:48:46,658 --> 01:49:01,445
[SPEAKER_42]: And I just think that you really have to dial it down because it's just not appropriate to laugh at people who are coming up with deep-rooted feelings of the stuff that's going on, which is not right by the mayor and most of the committee.

1204
01:49:01,485 --> 01:49:02,785
[SPEAKER_42]: So I just wanna make a point of that.

1205
01:49:02,825 --> 01:49:03,986
[SPEAKER_42]: I think that you really need to,

1206
01:49:05,538 --> 01:49:07,920
[SPEAKER_42]: think before you laugh or think before you speak.

1207
01:49:08,721 --> 01:49:12,464
[SPEAKER_42]: You know, there has to be a level of maturity that is just unfound.

1208
01:49:12,604 --> 01:49:13,665
[SPEAKER_42]: So thank you for your time.

1209
01:49:16,527 --> 01:49:17,028
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1210
01:49:17,048 --> 01:49:19,630
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, we'll go to the podium, name and address for the record, please.

1211
01:49:19,650 --> 01:49:21,051
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Castagnetti, you have three minutes.

1212
01:49:24,154 --> 01:49:25,395
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

1213
01:49:25,415 --> 01:49:28,718
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, I, I'm very confused and

1214
01:49:29,565 --> 01:49:30,906
[SPEAKER_09]: It's sad to hear this.

1215
01:49:31,086 --> 01:49:33,088
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a new method happening, I guess.

1216
01:49:33,749 --> 01:49:34,850
[SPEAKER_09]: I never heard of this before.

1217
01:49:34,870 --> 01:49:43,377
[SPEAKER_09]: But I just have one question for, I believe, for a Councilor, and hopefully that Councilor can respond this time.

1218
01:49:44,418 --> 01:49:52,625
[SPEAKER_09]: Did I hear a Councilor say that a needle was found in the bathroom in the City Hall premises?

1219
01:49:55,567 --> 01:50:03,251
[SPEAKER_24]: I believe the representative from Local 25 said that a needle was found, an unused needle was found in the bathroom at the DPW facility.

1220
01:50:03,271 --> 01:50:04,652
[SPEAKER_09]: I see.

1221
01:50:05,653 --> 01:50:08,014
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, could that have been a false flag?

1222
01:50:08,746 --> 01:50:15,510
[SPEAKER_09]: could have been planted by anyone and could that happen again and do emergency testing all over again in the future if that's the case?

1223
01:50:16,151 --> 01:50:17,972
[SPEAKER_24]: I do not have information.

1224
01:50:18,032 --> 01:50:19,253
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, I don't have that information.

1225
01:50:19,273 --> 01:50:24,716
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, all I have is the statement that we received from the mayor, their resolution by the Councilor and what we've heard at the podium.

1226
01:50:24,736 --> 01:50:25,757
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you know the location?

1227
01:50:27,078 --> 01:50:31,741
[SPEAKER_24]: I was, I've heard from the representative that it was at, uh, the DPW bathroom.

1228
01:50:33,322 --> 01:50:34,102
[SPEAKER_09]: Where's that located?

1229
01:50:34,543 --> 01:50:35,163
[SPEAKER_24]: At James street.

1230
01:50:35,543 --> 01:50:35,864
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1231
01:50:36,144 --> 01:50:36,444
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1232
01:50:41,431 --> 01:50:42,352
[SPEAKER_24]: Name and address for the record please.

1233
01:50:42,372 --> 01:50:42,992
[SPEAKER_24]: You have three minutes.

1234
01:50:43,292 --> 01:50:45,334
[SPEAKER_01]: Lori 55 Garfield Avenue.

1235
01:50:45,874 --> 01:50:47,355
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to make a point.

1236
01:50:48,115 --> 01:50:57,121
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even know this had happened and I think it's disgusting for a star but more disgusting was just three months ago.

1237
01:50:58,322 --> 01:51:00,944
[SPEAKER_01]: We as the residents on Salem Street.

1238
01:51:01,843 --> 01:51:08,713
[SPEAKER_01]: were picketing and fighting a methadone dispensary being put on Salem Street.

1239
01:51:09,735 --> 01:51:15,824
[SPEAKER_01]: And the mayor now finds that she has the authority to go after employees.

1240
01:51:16,823 --> 01:51:18,043
[SPEAKER_01]: because a needle was found?

1241
01:51:18,644 --> 01:51:36,349
[SPEAKER_01]: Does she even start to think of how many needles would be lining Salem Street if that dispensary had been approved there, which I understand is still on the table somewhere along the authority's ruling to put somewhere else in Medford.

1242
01:51:37,829 --> 01:51:39,130
[SPEAKER_01]: Just wanted to point that out.

1243
01:51:39,470 --> 01:51:40,030
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of,

1244
01:51:41,892 --> 01:51:47,758
[SPEAKER_01]: You can put a dispensary in, but now you're going after your employees because a needle was found?

1245
01:51:49,820 --> 01:51:50,801
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't understand that.

1246
01:51:51,281 --> 01:51:54,044
[SPEAKER_01]: Dispensaries are okay, needles are okay there, but.

1247
01:51:55,353 --> 01:52:06,958
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't think needles anywhere in the city are good, but it's kind of funny that the mayor would go and go after her employees for a needle that they don't even know where it came from.

1248
01:52:07,939 --> 01:52:12,061
[SPEAKER_01]: It was said earlier, it's not just DPW, it's a public bathroom.

1249
01:52:13,461 --> 01:52:18,404
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, just doesn't make a lot of sense, the management of this city these days.

1250
01:52:18,944 --> 01:52:20,765
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you guys don't understand,

1251
01:52:21,923 --> 01:52:27,006
[SPEAKER_01]: that the residents are not happy with what you're putting forward these days.

1252
01:52:28,327 --> 01:52:36,011
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe you should start listening to some of the residents because two years is coming soon.

1253
01:52:36,672 --> 01:52:37,112
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1254
01:52:39,393 --> 01:52:39,794
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1255
01:52:39,854 --> 01:52:41,935
[SPEAKER_24]: Any further comment by members of the public?

1256
01:52:45,877 --> 01:52:46,798
[SPEAKER_24]: Name and address for the record.

1257
01:52:46,818 --> 01:52:48,859
[SPEAKER_24]: You have three minutes, Nate, and I'll wait till you get to the phone.

1258
01:52:50,523 --> 01:52:52,023
[SPEAKER_22]: Nate Merritt, 373 Riverside Ave.

1259
01:52:52,424 --> 01:52:54,344
[SPEAKER_22]: Just a point of information for you all.

1260
01:52:54,364 --> 01:52:58,125
[SPEAKER_22]: There's a number of reasons why needles can be used for very legitimate purposes.

1261
01:52:59,566 --> 01:53:02,947
[SPEAKER_22]: Some people use them to administer fertility treatments on themselves.

1262
01:53:04,728 --> 01:53:05,228
[SPEAKER_22]: Diabetes.

1263
01:53:05,968 --> 01:53:09,069
[SPEAKER_22]: There's another number of legitimate medical concerns.

1264
01:53:10,229 --> 01:53:17,792
[SPEAKER_22]: Maybe it's something that y'all could maybe get more specifics on the needle that was found and perhaps if it had a potential alternate

1265
01:53:18,556 --> 01:53:21,118
[SPEAKER_22]: use for something non-nefarious.

1266
01:53:22,199 --> 01:53:22,379
Thank you.

1267
01:53:22,719 --> 01:53:23,340
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Mr. Martin.

1268
01:53:23,380 --> 01:53:29,384
[SPEAKER_24]: In terms of the specifics, I mean, it sounds like this is going to be litigated and evidence will be presented on that litigation.

1269
01:53:31,746 --> 01:53:32,867
[SPEAKER_24]: Any further public comments?

1270
01:53:35,489 --> 01:53:41,093
[SPEAKER_24]: Seeing none, I will go to Councilor Callahan and then Councilor Scarpelli and then Councilor Leming.

1271
01:53:41,153 --> 01:53:41,954
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Callahan.

1272
01:53:45,176 --> 01:53:45,657
[SPEAKER_24]: Oops, sorry.

1273
01:53:48,433 --> 01:53:51,095
[SPEAKER_37]: comment was actually from earlier just to explain.

1274
01:53:51,915 --> 01:53:59,399
[SPEAKER_37]: To the person who's asking us to respond that like actually, I think I at least for one Councilor was really hoping to hear from the public first.

1275
01:53:59,539 --> 01:54:02,401
[SPEAKER_37]: I did not want to interrupt and put in my own comments.

1276
01:54:02,441 --> 01:54:06,002
[SPEAKER_37]: I really wanted to hear a little bit more about what people had gone through and experienced.

1277
01:54:06,703 --> 01:54:08,944
[SPEAKER_37]: That was why I was not responding to that.

1278
01:54:09,264 --> 01:54:12,065
[SPEAKER_37]: I also do hope that we can.

1279
01:54:13,386 --> 01:54:18,868
[SPEAKER_37]: Are we going to sever before we discuss each one or are we going to sever at the very last second?

1280
01:54:18,968 --> 01:54:22,069
[SPEAKER_37]: I think it might be easier to sever and then discuss each piece.

1281
01:54:22,089 --> 01:54:30,772
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm just going to take the discussion that's on the table and then we can take any motions.

1282
01:54:32,113 --> 01:54:33,393
[SPEAKER_24]: Go to Councilor Scarpelli.

1283
01:54:34,434 --> 01:54:39,936
[SPEAKER_29]: If I can, Mr. President, I think that if I can have the representative from local 25

1284
01:54:42,133 --> 01:54:51,739
[SPEAKER_29]: And I think that part of this process, I think that there was a clear trend in meaning behind my resolutions.

1285
01:54:51,920 --> 01:54:59,585
[SPEAKER_29]: And I know it was something that's horrible and it's something that would be vetted out properly in the courts.

1286
01:55:00,825 --> 01:55:07,590
[SPEAKER_29]: But I think that what was clear is making sure that our community understood a few things.

1287
01:55:08,365 --> 01:55:14,849
[SPEAKER_29]: is one, we get a report that breaks down the funding mechanism and how money's being spent.

1288
01:55:14,989 --> 01:55:15,829
[SPEAKER_29]: That's the first thing.

1289
01:55:16,710 --> 01:55:26,455
[SPEAKER_29]: The second thing is that understanding the process that our leadership in this community in the mayor's office is lacking and it's causing a huge divide in our community.

1290
01:55:27,335 --> 01:55:31,078
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, we've talked about the police today, 900 days without a contract.

1291
01:55:31,618 --> 01:55:35,320
[SPEAKER_29]: We're talking about the firefighters having some serious issues right now.

1292
01:55:36,184 --> 01:55:37,644
[SPEAKER_29]: Um, and then right.

1293
01:55:37,864 --> 01:55:44,666
[SPEAKER_29]: And what we're talking about right now is what I need to know is how much just this one is an issue cost.

1294
01:55:45,166 --> 01:55:46,867
[SPEAKER_29]: And then you brought up a good point, Mr. Hatch.

1295
01:55:46,887 --> 01:55:49,927
[SPEAKER_29]: You said that, you know, how many communities do you work with?

1296
01:55:50,228 --> 01:55:52,408
[SPEAKER_29]: If you can, can you, what, what are they?

1297
01:55:52,468 --> 01:56:00,090
[SPEAKER_29]: If you can, do you know what, what communities...

1297
01:55:52,468 --> 01:56:00,090
[SPEAKER_11]: uh, we have the city of Newton city of walled dam.

1298
01:56:00,779 --> 01:56:17,471
[SPEAKER_11]: Cambridge, which is where I came from, Concord, Stowe, we have Hingham, we have, I said Watertown, Waltham is another big one, Chelsea, Billerica, Malden, Everett.

1299
01:56:18,452 --> 01:56:27,399
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay, I think that the question I need to ask you, you've obviously represented those communities and you've had leaders in those communities.

1300
01:56:28,703 --> 01:56:29,604
[SPEAKER_29]: Is it an anomaly?

1301
01:56:30,324 --> 01:56:33,127
[SPEAKER_29]: Is this a trend that we're seeing just because we're in Medford, we're isolated?

1302
01:56:33,707 --> 01:56:45,277
[SPEAKER_29]: I know by working in a municipality for the last 18 years, I see the difference, but most people don't understand that some people actually come to the city of Medford say, this is the norm.

1303
01:56:45,438 --> 01:56:46,879
[SPEAKER_29]: This is what a mayor is supposed to do.

1304
01:56:47,475 --> 01:56:52,339
[SPEAKER_29]: can you just shed just a little light on your experience and your other communities?

1305
01:56:53,880 --> 01:56:59,284
[SPEAKER_29]: Do you see the same trends and do you see the same financial impact to their communities that we're seeing here in Medford?

1306
01:56:59,804 --> 01:57:14,295
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I can tell you that me specifically, I worked for over 23 years in a municipality, in several, Concord and more recently for a while in Cambridge, one of the biggest cities in the state.

1307
01:57:15,951 --> 01:57:20,233
[SPEAKER_11]: And now I represent all of these cities here with Local 25.

1308
01:57:20,773 --> 01:57:26,956
[SPEAKER_11]: And I can honestly tell you Medford is hands down the worst city to work with.

1309
01:57:27,816 --> 01:57:29,437
[SPEAKER_11]: I can call any other community.

1310
01:57:29,557 --> 01:57:40,221
[SPEAKER_11]: I can call a city manager, a mayor, a town manager, no matter what, and ask a question, get an answer, work together, get our contracts done in the city of Medford.

1311
01:57:41,707 --> 01:57:48,470
[SPEAKER_11]: For somebody to violate somebody's constitutional rights, we've never seen it in Local 25, that any of us have been here.

1312
01:57:48,910 --> 01:57:52,592
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of us have been here over 25 years, fighting for these cities and towns.

1313
01:57:52,892 --> 01:57:54,333
[SPEAKER_11]: It has absolutely never happened.

1314
01:57:54,353 --> 01:57:57,815
[SPEAKER_11]: Our attorneys are in awe that this just happened.

1315
01:57:58,135 --> 01:57:59,535
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't see it anywhere.

1316
01:58:00,136 --> 01:58:03,397
[SPEAKER_11]: It's wasteful spending, and it's like nobody has control here.

1317
01:58:03,897 --> 01:58:06,979
[SPEAKER_29]: OK, so that's my final question is this, because this is what the point is.

1318
01:58:08,168 --> 01:58:14,130
[SPEAKER_29]: The amount of money we spent on drug testing and breathalyzers for these employees is important.

1319
01:58:14,150 --> 01:58:14,710
[SPEAKER_29]: I wanna see that.

1320
01:58:16,191 --> 01:58:24,874
[SPEAKER_29]: But I would love to see the cost that to the Teamsters, because we're not getting the true indication of what the city is paying for our attorneys, because we don't have a city solicitor.

1321
01:58:25,635 --> 01:58:33,978
[SPEAKER_29]: So I would like, if you can, if you could report back to the council and just give us an idea of what the Teamsters pay, their council,

1322
01:58:34,924 --> 01:58:45,752
[SPEAKER_29]: and fighting method issues, because that will at least give us a true indication that in the last five and a half years, we've seen that the teams have paid X amount of dollars.

1323
01:58:46,333 --> 01:58:50,876
[SPEAKER_29]: And from what I gather, it should be pretty equivalent to see where our money is going.

1324
01:58:51,296 --> 01:58:56,920
[SPEAKER_29]: Again, I'm bringing this forward to the community so we can understand a major impact to our community.

1325
01:58:57,281 --> 01:59:01,364
[SPEAKER_29]: And I bring up the override every time because we talk about mismanagement of funds.

1326
01:59:02,569 --> 01:59:10,475
[SPEAKER_29]: And when we have the representatives of 14 other communities, and we hear that this doesn't happen anywhere else, that's a red flag.

1327
01:59:11,476 --> 01:59:13,578
[SPEAKER_29]: So again, I know what was happening.

1328
01:59:13,798 --> 01:59:14,499
[SPEAKER_29]: We don't like it.

1329
01:59:15,600 --> 01:59:18,162
[SPEAKER_29]: We stand against it 1,000% as human beings.

1330
01:59:18,762 --> 01:59:30,612
[SPEAKER_29]: But truly, the intent for this resolution is really to understand, A, the financial impact that we're seeing in all of my other resolutions I put in place, and then B, again,

1331
01:59:31,696 --> 01:59:36,818
[SPEAKER_29]: the lack of true transparency and true leadership with the mayor of this community.

1332
01:59:37,638 --> 01:59:38,939
[SPEAKER_29]: So again, I thank you so much.

1333
01:59:39,579 --> 01:59:46,222
[SPEAKER_29]: Again, I apologize that things are getting heated again, but I know it's something that's very emotional.

1334
01:59:46,262 --> 01:59:54,565
[SPEAKER_29]: I talked to at least 10 DPW workers that call me directly that I've grown up with, I've been friends with, that were absolutely appalled and embarrassed.

1335
01:59:54,585 --> 01:59:57,006
[SPEAKER_29]: Their wives called me and said, this is a disgrace.

1336
01:59:57,647 --> 02:00:00,368
[SPEAKER_29]: What my husband had to endure today was a disgrace.

1337
02:00:01,776 --> 02:00:09,980
[SPEAKER_29]: And I can't speak to that more than I can, or I wish I could because I would have called the city solicitor and asked him how far I can go with this.

1338
02:00:10,040 --> 02:00:17,104
[SPEAKER_29]: But I know that you have put forth the civil rights lawsuit, I believe against the mayor and against the city, correct?

1339
02:00:17,604 --> 02:00:19,225
[SPEAKER_29]: So that's going to be interesting to see.

1340
02:00:19,585 --> 02:00:22,987
[SPEAKER_29]: And again, another financial impact to our community.

1341
02:00:23,727 --> 02:00:25,588
[SPEAKER_29]: So thank you.

1342
02:00:31,609 --> 02:00:34,531
[SPEAKER_11]: plus, just to our members, aside from other unions.

1343
02:00:34,711 --> 02:00:36,732
[SPEAKER_11]: But we'll be more than happy to get you that information.

1344
02:00:36,752 --> 02:00:45,936
[SPEAKER_29]: That'll be interesting, because I know that this administration, what they love to do is they like to come back and say, oh, in Everett, they pay this much, and in Malden, they pay this much.

1345
02:00:46,276 --> 02:00:54,080
[SPEAKER_29]: What I'd like to see is what you pay out to fight issues legally with Everett, with Melrose,

1346
02:00:55,699 --> 02:01:02,801
[SPEAKER_29]: Chelsea with Cambridge, just to get a true indication how poorly mismanaged this community is when it comes to fiscal transparency.

1347
02:01:03,001 --> 02:01:04,421
[SPEAKER_11]: Just a quick side note on that.

1348
02:01:04,441 --> 02:01:08,102
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of those cities, so you know, have city solicitors on the payroll.

1349
02:01:08,442 --> 02:01:15,944
[SPEAKER_11]: The city of Medford doesn't, so he works by hour, but he's more controllable than a city solicitor.

1350
02:01:16,004 --> 02:01:18,505
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'll get you all that information.

1351
02:01:18,545 --> 02:01:18,945
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1352
02:01:19,005 --> 02:01:20,826
[SPEAKER_24]: I would just note that we have received

1353
02:01:23,001 --> 02:01:29,205
[SPEAKER_24]: dozens of warrant articles, multiple reports about the legal costs paid out by the city, from the city administration.

1354
02:01:29,225 --> 02:01:30,526
[SPEAKER_24]: It's public documents.

1355
02:01:31,506 --> 02:01:32,407
[SPEAKER_24]: We can provide them.

1356
02:01:32,447 --> 02:01:34,468
[SPEAKER_24]: They're sent to us by email on a monthly basis.

1357
02:01:34,588 --> 02:01:36,390
[SPEAKER_24]: The administration can provide them.

1358
02:01:37,130 --> 02:01:44,155
[SPEAKER_24]: And the city has never spent more than the budgeted amount for the law department, budgeted in our fiscal year budget.

1359
02:01:46,616 --> 02:01:56,399
[SPEAKER_24]: there has been no additional spending or major financial impact on the city beyond the legal budget that is budgeted every year through the fiscal year budget process and that is proven out by the financial documents.

1360
02:01:56,739 --> 02:01:59,420
[SPEAKER_11]: I think all of our legal payouts should be accounted for.

1361
02:01:59,540 --> 02:01:59,920
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1362
02:01:59,940 --> 02:02:00,200
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1363
02:02:00,500 --> 02:02:01,060
[SPEAKER_11]: All the settlements.

1364
02:02:01,080 --> 02:02:01,880
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

1365
02:02:02,701 --> 02:02:03,521
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm speaking right now.

1366
02:02:03,581 --> 02:02:03,921
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1367
02:02:08,860 --> 02:02:10,201
[SPEAKER_24]: Any further comments from members of council?

1368
02:02:10,221 --> 02:02:13,042
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm going to go to Councilor Leming.

1369
02:02:13,082 --> 02:02:14,683
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm going to go to Councilor Leming.

1370
02:02:14,723 --> 02:02:15,404
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1371
02:02:15,484 --> 02:02:17,305
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Leming.

1372
02:02:18,585 --> 02:02:20,727
[SPEAKER_33]: Yes, thank you, Council President.

1373
02:02:20,887 --> 02:02:31,433
[SPEAKER_33]: So I didn't do this earlier because I wanted to hear what the folks from the DBW in the room had to say during public comment.

1374
02:02:31,953 --> 02:02:37,556
[SPEAKER_33]: And it is a point that I have a lot of sympathy with considering that I work a job where I get

1375
02:02:38,426 --> 02:02:42,648
[SPEAKER_33]: uh, urinalysis testing in front of my colleagues at least three times a year.

1376
02:02:42,668 --> 02:02:53,333
[SPEAKER_33]: So, um, but there are, there are, uh, other issues with this resolution that I have mainly OML considerations, which has been discussed in this council before.

1377
02:02:54,173 --> 02:03:00,856
[SPEAKER_33]: And I want more information about the private investigator issue, uh, as well as, uh,

1378
02:03:02,998 --> 02:03:08,823
[SPEAKER_33]: the fact that I'm not sure about the city council stepping into strictly school committee issues.

1379
02:03:08,843 --> 02:03:10,745
[SPEAKER_33]: So I'm going to go and invoke rule 21 on this.

1380
02:03:10,845 --> 02:03:11,485
[SPEAKER_33]: We can move on.

1381
02:03:12,266 --> 02:03:12,626
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

1382
02:03:14,708 --> 02:03:16,470
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Leming has invoked rule 21.

1383
02:03:16,730 --> 02:03:20,393
[SPEAKER_24]: I think we have a number of financial items.

1384
02:03:25,097 --> 02:03:27,459
[SPEAKER_24]: We talked about, we talked about

1385
02:03:28,786 --> 02:03:29,527
[SPEAKER_24]: Hold on a minute, please.

1386
02:03:29,547 --> 02:03:29,927
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1387
02:03:30,147 --> 02:03:33,249
[SPEAKER_24]: Cost associated with terminating the school and superintendent's contract.

1388
02:03:34,210 --> 02:03:37,012
[SPEAKER_24]: Finance director appeared articulate dropping bond rating.

1389
02:03:38,993 --> 02:03:40,854
[SPEAKER_24]: Utilization of a complete financial report.

1390
02:03:40,874 --> 02:03:42,856
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, there's multiple financial items in this paper.

1391
02:03:47,495 --> 02:03:48,315
[SPEAKER_24]: I'll read the rule.

1392
02:03:48,675 --> 02:03:52,737
[SPEAKER_29]: It's talking about when we talk about when you're voting on funding.

1393
02:03:53,557 --> 02:03:56,198
[SPEAKER_29]: This isn't a financial paper voting on funding.

1394
02:03:56,538 --> 02:04:01,100
[SPEAKER_29]: This is a resolution asking for financial documents that are spent by the city.

1395
02:04:01,500 --> 02:04:03,041
[SPEAKER_29]: We're not asking for spending money.

1396
02:04:03,101 --> 02:04:06,642
[SPEAKER_29]: That's a negative way to get out of this.

1397
02:04:06,982 --> 02:04:10,944
[SPEAKER_29]: And I tell you, I'm embarrassed that that just happened.

1398
02:04:11,444 --> 02:04:13,645
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm just, I'm... Any councillor...

1399
02:04:15,615 --> 02:04:16,576
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm going to read the rules.

1400
02:04:17,176 --> 02:04:17,937
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm going to read the rules.

1401
02:04:17,997 --> 02:04:18,317
[SPEAKER_24]: Thanks.

1402
02:04:21,460 --> 02:04:23,862
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll take a look and I can ask for an interpretation.

1403
02:04:23,882 --> 02:04:29,707
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, that's our parliamentarian.

1404
02:04:29,727 --> 02:04:30,848
[SPEAKER_24]: The clerk needed.

1405
02:04:31,028 --> 02:04:31,388
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1406
02:04:43,834 --> 02:04:46,276
[SPEAKER_24]: does any finance paper related?

1407
02:04:46,296 --> 02:04:48,758
[SPEAKER_29]: This isn't a finance paper, Mr. President.

1408
02:04:49,058 --> 02:04:54,263
[SPEAKER_29]: This is a resolution asking for not to fund a finance paper.

1409
02:04:54,863 --> 02:04:58,506
[SPEAKER_29]: It's to ask, inquire of how much was funded.

1410
02:04:58,586 --> 02:05:02,730
[SPEAKER_29]: That has nothing to do with financial intent for the rule.

1411
02:05:02,750 --> 02:05:03,991
[SPEAKER_29]: And you know what it is, Mr. President.

1412
02:05:04,011 --> 02:05:05,812
[SPEAKER_29]: So I don't know why we're doing this on a phone show.

1413
02:05:06,112 --> 02:05:07,013
[SPEAKER_29]: You're smarter than this.

1414
02:05:07,053 --> 02:05:09,075
[SPEAKER_29]: Don't embarrass this council like this.

1415
02:05:09,605 --> 02:05:13,267
[SPEAKER_29]: This is nothing to do about calling for rule 21.

1416
02:05:13,487 --> 02:05:17,889
[SPEAKER_29]: They're talking about moving money forward in a financial resolution.

1417
02:05:18,049 --> 02:05:19,129
[SPEAKER_29]: This is not the intent of it.

1418
02:05:19,390 --> 02:05:20,470
[SPEAKER_29]: Please don't do this again.

1419
02:05:20,550 --> 02:05:22,251
[SPEAKER_24]: Please hold on a minute, Councilor Scarpa.

1420
02:05:22,271 --> 02:05:24,112
[SPEAKER_24]: Please just take a breath.

1421
02:05:26,073 --> 02:05:30,975
[SPEAKER_24]: If we would be willing to discuss the financial elements or sever out the financial elements of the paper.

1422
02:05:32,424 --> 02:05:37,006
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, the rule is really broad and it's been used incredibly broadly in this council for a very long time.

1423
02:05:37,807 --> 02:05:41,368
[SPEAKER_24]: So, um, yeah, it has been several times.

1424
02:05:43,810 --> 02:05:45,050
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Scarpelli, please.

1425
02:05:45,951 --> 02:05:46,791
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1426
02:05:46,811 --> 02:05:50,133
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1427
02:05:50,653 --> 02:05:51,453
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1428
02:05:59,411 --> 02:06:00,311
[SPEAKER_24]: What are you talking about?

1429
02:06:02,752 --> 02:06:05,892
[SPEAKER_24]: You have done rule 21 multiple times as well, Councilor Scarpelli.

1430
02:06:07,292 --> 02:06:07,613
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

1431
02:06:09,453 --> 02:06:15,334
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm going to rule that we're not going to invoke rule 21 if we sever out financial elements from non-financial elements of the paper.

1432
02:06:15,474 --> 02:06:21,275
[SPEAKER_24]: Is there a motion to sever the paper into at least elements regarding finances and non-finances?

1433
02:06:22,855 --> 02:06:26,216
[SPEAKER_24]: Or does the Councilor want to pull back rule 21?

1434
02:06:29,744 --> 02:06:33,467
[SPEAKER_33]: No, I'm keeping, I'm keeping my rule 21 invocation.

1435
02:06:33,687 --> 02:06:34,027
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

1436
02:06:35,929 --> 02:06:42,234
[SPEAKER_24]: On a motion to question the ruling of the chair by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

1437
02:06:44,536 --> 02:06:44,696
[SPEAKER_24]: Ms.

1438
02:06:44,716 --> 02:06:45,677
[SPEAKER_24]: Clerk, please call the roll.

1439
02:06:53,603 --> 02:06:54,564
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm not sure what the motion is.

1440
02:06:54,724 --> 02:06:55,184
[SPEAKER_24]: It's just a...

1441
02:07:02,473 --> 02:07:05,515
[SPEAKER_24]: I have said that I believe that there are financial elements to this paper.

1442
02:07:14,460 --> 02:07:17,702
[SPEAKER_24]: My ruling that there are finance elements to the paper that rule 21 would apply here.

1443
02:07:19,383 --> 02:07:20,244
[SPEAKER_24]: Vice President Collins.

1444
02:07:23,407 --> 02:07:23,787
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1445
02:07:24,988 --> 02:07:33,273
[SPEAKER_18]: I would note that it wouldn't be my preference to rule 21 this resolution, but I do think that we should separate it out into at least four resolutions and then proceed from there.

1446
02:07:36,215 --> 02:07:44,920
[SPEAKER_18]: The first four lines as one resolution, and then the next four paragraphs as one resolution each, and we should, that would be my preference to go from there.

1447
02:07:48,345 --> 02:07:50,665
[SPEAKER_24]: Sounds like there's two options in front of us.

1448
02:07:50,885 --> 02:07:53,666
[SPEAKER_24]: One is I have ruled that there are financial elements to this paper.

1449
02:07:55,086 --> 02:08:04,208
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, we could move forward with questioning that, that any of this counts as a finance paper, um, or we could consider the motion to sever prior to that.

1450
02:08:05,388 --> 02:08:08,749
[SPEAKER_24]: Uh, that's up to, um, councilor Scarpelli.

1451
02:08:10,769 --> 02:08:14,530
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Callahan did indicate their decision wanting a motion to sever.

1452
02:08:16,950 --> 02:08:17,110
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

1453
02:08:18,821 --> 02:08:39,892
[SPEAKER_24]: um then uh there's but it was after the second there was already a motion to question the ruling of the chair the motion to sever was was that we would do it after discussion you didn't make a motion to sever you said it was a recommended course of action there was no second there's a second emotion to overrule the ruling of the chair that there are financial elements in this paper that qualify under rule 21

1454
02:08:48,962 --> 02:08:49,842
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

1455
02:08:50,022 --> 02:08:54,225
[SPEAKER_24]: If they want to reach out to me now, I would be happy to hear their interpretation.

1456
02:08:57,067 --> 02:08:58,007
[SPEAKER_37]: My mic is on.

1457
02:08:58,027 --> 02:09:00,209
[SPEAKER_37]: Does that mean I am allowed to speak?

1458
02:09:01,250 --> 02:09:04,592
[SPEAKER_24]: Is there further discussion on the motion of question really in the chair?

1459
02:09:05,172 --> 02:09:07,233
[SPEAKER_37]: I would just say that I, I think rule 21 is

1460
02:09:09,250 --> 02:09:11,692
[SPEAKER_37]: very unhealthy for us to use.

1461
02:09:12,132 --> 02:09:15,154
[SPEAKER_37]: I think that we should use it incredibly sparingly.

1462
02:09:15,634 --> 02:09:19,857
[SPEAKER_37]: I believe that a financial paper is in fact one that moves funding, and we are not doing that.

1463
02:09:20,137 --> 02:09:22,978
[SPEAKER_37]: This does not actually move any funding anywhere.

1464
02:09:23,319 --> 02:09:33,585
[SPEAKER_37]: So to me, classifying this as a finance paper with regards to Rule 21 really makes Rule 21 far more broad than I am comfortable with.

1465
02:09:34,405 --> 02:09:38,067
[SPEAKER_37]: I did not think that was what, like, I don't read rule 21 as saying that.

1466
02:09:39,888 --> 02:09:47,653
[SPEAKER_37]: So, you know, I think a ton of people have come here to hear our thoughts on this and to hear us make, you know, either move this forward or not.

1467
02:09:47,793 --> 02:09:57,118
[SPEAKER_37]: And I think it is, it's not really the best, I think, for anyone if we do not allow this discussion to have a conclusion tonight.

1468
02:09:57,918 --> 02:09:58,098
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

1469
02:09:58,458 --> 02:10:00,860
[SPEAKER_24]: And I would just note that I am actually operating under

1470
02:10:02,332 --> 02:10:05,653
[SPEAKER_24]: legal opinions that I received that rule 21 stems from the charter right.

1471
02:10:06,173 --> 02:10:19,537
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Scarpelli invoked the charter right in June, and I had to go to legal counsel to discuss that charter right, and legal counsel informed me that the charter right under this rule applies to any motion, order, or resolution under consideration by the council.

1472
02:10:21,277 --> 02:10:23,778
[SPEAKER_24]: So it's kind of a catch-22 situation.

1473
02:10:23,798 --> 02:10:24,498
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't like it.

1474
02:10:24,578 --> 02:10:26,859
[SPEAKER_24]: It's one of the reasons I think we need to have a charter change.

1475
02:10:28,504 --> 02:10:31,185
[SPEAKER_24]: And I believe I misinterpreted it last time by being too restrictive.

1476
02:10:31,705 --> 02:10:34,886
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's why I'm not being restrictive now, based on advice of counsel.

1477
02:10:37,647 --> 02:10:46,349
[SPEAKER_24]: So, we are where we are because this has been invoked multiple times by multiple Councilors, and given the council opinion that I received in July.

1478
02:10:47,512 --> 02:10:50,654
[SPEAKER_24]: I believe that under mass general law is the charter that's been adopted by the city.

1479
02:10:51,394 --> 02:10:57,899
[SPEAKER_24]: The interpretation that I received from the city's legal counsel was that literally any paper could be postponed by any Councilor until the next meeting for any reason.

1480
02:10:58,019 --> 02:11:01,581
[SPEAKER_24]: So, um, huh?

1481
02:11:04,002 --> 02:11:04,943
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, it wasn't from the mayor.

1482
02:11:04,963 --> 02:11:07,344
[SPEAKER_24]: It was from the council at KP law.

1483
02:11:08,825 --> 02:11:09,166
[SPEAKER_24]: So, um,

1484
02:11:11,786 --> 02:11:16,470
[SPEAKER_24]: We could take a motion on the ruling of the chair, but again, that's the council advice that advice I received from council.

1485
02:11:16,750 --> 02:11:17,811
[SPEAKER_24]: I've been on both sides of this.

1486
02:11:17,851 --> 02:11:26,517
[SPEAKER_24]: I was too restrictive last time when I ruled something one way, and now I'm trying to go the other way because of the advice I received.

1487
02:11:26,597 --> 02:11:34,703
[SPEAKER_29]: It seems like it's kind of a no-win scenario for the chair.

1488
02:11:35,184 --> 02:11:36,645
[SPEAKER_24]: He said that he wanted more information.

1489
02:11:36,685 --> 02:11:38,266
[SPEAKER_24]: He wanted more time to receive more information.

1490
02:11:38,286 --> 02:11:40,488
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know if he can speak to it,

1491
02:11:41,545 --> 02:11:47,229
[SPEAKER_24]: If we want to go on the motion overall, the ruling of the chair by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Callahan, that's the motion that's on the floor.

1492
02:11:48,130 --> 02:11:53,054
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Scarpelli has not withdrawn, so I will take the vote on that.

1493
02:11:56,917 --> 02:11:57,857
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1494
02:11:58,218 --> 02:11:58,898
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Callahan?

1495
02:11:59,098 --> 02:11:59,278
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes.

1496
02:12:00,039 --> 02:12:00,799
[SPEAKER_36]: Vice President Collins?

1497
02:12:00,819 --> 02:12:00,879
[SPEAKER_36]: No.

1498
02:12:03,001 --> 02:12:03,602
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Lazzaro?

1499
02:12:03,622 --> 02:12:03,742
[SPEAKER_36]: No.

1500
02:12:05,663 --> 02:12:06,183
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Leming?

1501
02:12:06,724 --> 02:12:06,924
[SPEAKER_24]: No.

1502
02:12:08,185 --> 02:12:08,946
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1503
02:12:09,066 --> 02:12:09,266
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes.

1504
02:12:09,926 --> 02:12:10,507
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Tseng?

1505
02:12:12,775 --> 02:12:16,438
[SPEAKER_24]: I can't vote to overrule my own ruling, can I?

1506
02:12:20,121 --> 02:12:24,964
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm going to vote yes.

1507
02:12:25,705 --> 02:12:26,586
[SPEAKER_24]: Actually, that's a great idea.

1508
02:12:27,206 --> 02:12:28,087
[SPEAKER_24]: I will vote present.

1509
02:12:28,107 --> 02:12:29,928
[SPEAKER_24]: 3-3, the motion fails.

1510
02:12:29,988 --> 02:12:33,751
[SPEAKER_24]: So we'll go to the next motion, which is the motion to sever.

1511
02:12:40,339 --> 02:12:44,760
[SPEAKER_24]: Is there a motion, there's a motion to sever, Councilor Callahan, do you want to go further into that?

1512
02:12:44,880 --> 02:12:45,920
[SPEAKER_37]: It's her motion to sever.

1513
02:12:45,960 --> 02:12:48,240
[SPEAKER_37]: Can you please repeat exactly how you want to sever it?

1514
02:12:54,321 --> 02:12:55,262
[SPEAKER_24]: Vice President Collins.

1515
02:12:56,102 --> 02:12:56,442
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1516
02:12:57,242 --> 02:13:04,023
[SPEAKER_18]: My proposal would be to sever into four resolutions.

1517
02:13:04,483 --> 02:13:09,664
[SPEAKER_18]: The first one comprising the first four lines, the second one being the second paragraph, or sorry, the fifth line.

1518
02:13:11,718 --> 02:13:16,702
[SPEAKER_18]: The third one being the second to last paragraph and the fourth one being the last paragraph.

1519
02:13:17,722 --> 02:13:19,263
[SPEAKER_24]: So they're divided by topic.

1520
02:13:19,584 --> 02:13:36,255
[SPEAKER_24]: The motions would be the first vote would be on requesting those from the school department, the following information, the cost associated with terminating the school superintendent's contract, course communications, correspondence, meeting minutes, records, and reports regarding the separation and the anticipated costs of the search committee and interim appointment.

1521
02:13:36,956 --> 02:13:37,156
[SPEAKER_18]: Correct.

1522
02:13:38,103 --> 02:13:46,631
[SPEAKER_24]: All right, the second is the finance director appear before the council to articulate a plan to restore the bond rating that was amended, I believe by Councilor Scarpelli.

1523
02:13:48,253 --> 02:13:48,773
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

1524
02:13:49,093 --> 02:13:49,354
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

1525
02:14:00,355 --> 02:14:13,261
[SPEAKER_24]: The third one is regarding private investigators and resolve that the administration report back to the council that identified line in the budget where we are paying private investigators and a complete financial report from the start of this practice to the present.

1526
02:14:13,881 --> 02:14:21,684
[SPEAKER_24]: And then the fourth is the administrative reporting to the council on the cost of questionable drug testing and a report outlining the reasons for these tests.

1527
02:14:22,724 --> 02:14:26,566
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm being further resolve the council move to executive session if the issues are confidential.

1528
02:14:28,507 --> 02:14:29,909
[SPEAKER_24]: Does that sound right, Councilor Collins?

1529
02:14:30,009 --> 02:14:30,209
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1530
02:14:30,389 --> 02:14:31,671
[SPEAKER_24]: Is there a second on the motion to sever?

1531
02:14:31,691 --> 02:14:31,811
[SPEAKER_24]: Second.

1532
02:14:33,573 --> 02:14:36,536
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion to sever by Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

1533
02:14:36,556 --> 02:14:36,597
[SPEAKER_24]: Ms.

1534
02:14:36,617 --> 02:14:38,178
[SPEAKER_24]: Clerk, please call the roll.

1535
02:14:40,421 --> 02:14:42,764
[SPEAKER_24]: Before we call the roll, Councilor Callahan.

1536
02:14:46,642 --> 02:15:00,830
[SPEAKER_37]: The reason I had split it into five was because the first and third sentences, their cost associated with terminating school superintendent's contract and anticipated costs of superintendent search committee and interim appointment, those to me seem to go together.

1537
02:15:01,951 --> 02:15:07,594
[SPEAKER_37]: Asking for any and all communications, corresponding meeting minutes, I may have a very different opinion of that one.

1538
02:15:08,054 --> 02:15:09,495
[SPEAKER_37]: So I would start.

1539
02:15:10,435 --> 02:15:11,396
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you very much.

1540
02:15:11,436 --> 02:15:13,038
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Scarpelli has struck that.

1541
02:15:13,458 --> 02:15:17,221
[SPEAKER_24]: So on the motion to sever as amended, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1542
02:15:24,487 --> 02:15:25,127
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Callahan?

1543
02:15:25,768 --> 02:15:25,968
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes.

1544
02:15:27,849 --> 02:15:28,650
[SPEAKER_36]: Vice President Collins?

1545
02:15:28,670 --> 02:15:28,870
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes.

1546
02:15:29,771 --> 02:15:30,632
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Lazzaro?

1547
02:15:30,652 --> 02:15:30,772
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes.

1548
02:15:31,292 --> 02:15:31,873
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Leming?

1549
02:15:32,413 --> 02:15:32,693
[SPEAKER_35]: Yes.

1550
02:15:33,994 --> 02:15:34,615
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1551
02:15:34,635 --> 02:15:34,695
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes.

1552
02:15:36,988 --> 02:15:37,568
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Tseng.

1553
02:15:37,628 --> 02:15:37,789
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes.

1554
02:15:38,209 --> 02:15:38,789
[SPEAKER_36]: President Fares.

1555
02:15:39,009 --> 02:15:39,330
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

1556
02:15:40,570 --> 02:15:41,711
[SPEAKER_24]: Six in the affirmative, one in the negative.

1557
02:15:41,811 --> 02:15:42,392
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion severed.

1558
02:15:42,412 --> 02:15:43,172
[SPEAKER_24]: Or is that 5-2?

1559
02:15:43,192 --> 02:15:43,392
[SPEAKER_24]: 6-1.

1560
02:15:43,412 --> 02:15:45,153
[SPEAKER_24]: 6-1.

1561
02:15:45,193 --> 02:15:45,594
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1562
02:15:46,554 --> 02:15:55,880
[SPEAKER_24]: So we'll take the first one, which is regarding the cost associated in terminating the superintendent's contract and the anticipated cost of the superintendent search committee and interim appointment.

1563
02:15:59,103 --> 02:16:00,343
[SPEAKER_24]: Any discussion on that item?

1564
02:16:02,825 --> 02:16:04,286
[SPEAKER_24]: I think we can label these 518A, B, C, and D.

1565
02:16:10,680 --> 02:16:14,521
[SPEAKER_40]: Councilor Lazzaro.

1566
02:16:14,881 --> 02:16:24,764
[SPEAKER_40]: The only reason I will vote no on this first issue is because it's a school committee issue and because of the separation of powers in our city.

1567
02:16:25,744 --> 02:16:31,426
[SPEAKER_40]: Not because it's not interesting, not because it doesn't, it may not have a budgetary impact on us.

1568
02:16:31,586 --> 02:16:35,807
[SPEAKER_40]: We will see the budgetary impact when it is pertinent to our body.

1569
02:16:37,724 --> 02:16:48,253
[SPEAKER_40]: It's it's it's like the main job of school committee is to oversee hire non-renew, rehire, start a search committee, this whole thing.

1570
02:16:48,293 --> 02:16:49,354
[SPEAKER_40]: That is what school committee does.

1571
02:16:49,414 --> 02:16:50,515
[SPEAKER_40]: That's not what City Council does.

1572
02:16:51,016 --> 02:16:51,316
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

1573
02:16:52,737 --> 02:16:53,157
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1574
02:16:53,358 --> 02:16:54,699
[SPEAKER_24]: Any further discussion on that item?

1575
02:16:55,239 --> 02:16:57,101
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Jones, do you want to talk about the superintendent?

1576
02:17:03,371 --> 02:17:19,579
[SPEAKER_24]: Is it regarding the bond rating, the private investigators, or the... Sure.

1577
02:17:19,699 --> 02:17:20,860
[SPEAKER_24]: Let me just recognize you.

1578
02:17:21,240 --> 02:17:22,481
[SPEAKER_24]: Public participation, three minutes.

1579
02:17:23,201 --> 02:17:23,521
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

1580
02:17:23,941 --> 02:17:24,962
[SPEAKER_25]: Bob Jones, 5 St.

1581
02:17:25,002 --> 02:17:25,522
[SPEAKER_25]: Mary Street.

1582
02:17:25,702 --> 02:17:26,743
[SPEAKER_25]: As you said earlier,

1583
02:17:27,864 --> 02:17:36,753
[SPEAKER_25]: The legal fees, wrongful termination suits, all those type of monies that have been paid out have been paid out of the legal fees account.

1584
02:17:36,973 --> 02:17:38,494
[SPEAKER_25]: Legal department account, is that what you stated?

1585
02:17:39,035 --> 02:17:50,466
[SPEAKER_24]: No, I said that what has been presented to the council and the legal fees paid to outside lawyers hasn't been paid out of the law budget and has not exceeded the law budget in any prior fiscal year.

1586
02:17:50,746 --> 02:17:52,567
[SPEAKER_24]: based on the reports given to us by the administration.

1587
02:17:52,587 --> 02:18:00,133
[SPEAKER_25]: All right, so the law budget, as I understand it, is for the law department, which has solicitor, city solicitor, and an assistant.

1588
02:18:00,313 --> 02:18:03,275
[SPEAKER_24]: It also includes ordinary expenses for settlements.

1589
02:18:03,816 --> 02:18:04,436
[SPEAKER_24]: How much is that?

1590
02:18:05,056 --> 02:18:06,237
[SPEAKER_24]: I think it's $100,000.

1591
02:18:06,598 --> 02:18:07,158
[SPEAKER_24]: Very small, $100,000.

1592
02:18:08,099 --> 02:18:11,981
[SPEAKER_24]: It's a quarter to a fifth of the law department budget.

1593
02:18:12,082 --> 02:18:13,242
[SPEAKER_25]: OK, so we're talking about $100,000.

1594
02:18:13,282 --> 02:18:14,783
[SPEAKER_25]: I have documented $880,000 of KP law expenses.

1595
02:18:19,898 --> 02:18:22,739
[SPEAKER_25]: There is $500,000 in lawful termination suits.

1596
02:18:23,259 --> 02:18:27,500
[SPEAKER_25]: There are many millions of dollars that are being spent on legal fees.

1597
02:18:28,420 --> 02:18:31,961
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't think anybody knows where they're coming from, because they're not coming from the law department.

1598
02:18:32,621 --> 02:18:43,223
[SPEAKER_25]: I, as well as many of you city councils, have been to many a budget hearing, and I have never discussed claims paid, line item, of a million dollars plus in the budget.

1599
02:18:43,783 --> 02:18:46,244
[SPEAKER_25]: So I would love to know where they're coming from, because it can't be coming out of $100,000.

1600
02:18:46,284 --> 02:18:48,484
[SPEAKER_25]: It's not coming out of the law department.

1601
02:18:48,973 --> 02:18:50,015
[SPEAKER_25]: This is not enough money there.

1602
02:18:50,596 --> 02:18:51,477
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't think anybody knows.

1603
02:18:51,918 --> 02:18:53,681
[SPEAKER_25]: And I'd like to get a clear answer on that.

1604
02:18:53,962 --> 02:18:55,464
[SPEAKER_25]: From the discussion Scarpelli's motion.

1605
02:18:57,915 --> 02:19:00,095
[SPEAKER_25]: It's not coming out of the law department, I'll tell you right now.

1606
02:19:00,295 --> 02:19:12,738
[SPEAKER_24]: From the discussions we've had and several of them in public session, there are claims paid by insurance that are paid by the city's insurance.

1607
02:19:14,078 --> 02:19:15,099
[SPEAKER_24]: Which type of insurance?

1608
02:19:16,739 --> 02:19:19,759
[SPEAKER_24]: I would have to look into the specific insurance policies that they're paid out under.

1609
02:19:21,180 --> 02:19:23,240
[SPEAKER_25]: I've looked at the budget many times.

1610
02:19:23,780 --> 02:19:24,820
[SPEAKER_25]: I have a degree in accounting.

1611
02:19:24,840 --> 02:19:26,081
[SPEAKER_25]: I've been the treasurer for 20 years.

1612
02:19:26,501 --> 02:19:27,281
[SPEAKER_25]: I can't figure it out.

1613
02:19:27,728 --> 02:19:27,948
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

1614
02:19:28,168 --> 02:19:29,309
[SPEAKER_25]: So, I must not be the only one.

1615
02:19:29,329 --> 02:19:30,309
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't think anybody knows.

1616
02:19:31,170 --> 02:19:32,670
[SPEAKER_25]: So, I'd love to get an answer.

1617
02:19:32,871 --> 02:19:33,951
[SPEAKER_24]: We have been presented the warrant.

1618
02:19:33,991 --> 02:19:34,952
[SPEAKER_25]: Where are these are coming from?

1619
02:19:35,472 --> 02:19:36,892
[SPEAKER_25]: Can I see the warrants?

1620
02:19:37,013 --> 02:19:38,193
[SPEAKER_25]: What line item are they coming out of?

1621
02:19:38,473 --> 02:19:39,694
[SPEAKER_24]: You can absolutely see the warrant articles.

1622
02:19:39,734 --> 02:19:43,716
[SPEAKER_24]: What I'm telling you is that inside the warrant articles, there have not been settlements paid in those amounts.

1623
02:19:43,916 --> 02:19:45,377
[SPEAKER_24]: So, they're not coming from the city's general fund.

1624
02:19:45,397 --> 02:19:45,477
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

1625
02:19:45,497 --> 02:19:46,337
[SPEAKER_24]: So, where are they coming from?

1626
02:19:46,357 --> 02:19:50,019
[SPEAKER_24]: We have been advised by the administration that there have been settlements paid by the city's insurance.

1627
02:19:50,819 --> 02:19:51,500
[SPEAKER_25]: says insurance.

1628
02:19:51,580 --> 02:19:51,920
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

1629
02:19:52,160 --> 02:19:54,803
[SPEAKER_24]: So we have a policy with an insurance company that's paying these out.

1630
02:19:54,923 --> 02:19:58,566
[SPEAKER_24]: There are several policies that the city has with insurance companies on a number of issues.

1631
02:19:58,826 --> 02:19:59,187
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

1632
02:19:59,447 --> 02:20:01,909
[SPEAKER_25]: What, then what line item does that come out of to pay for those?

1633
02:20:02,690 --> 02:20:07,074
[SPEAKER_24]: The premiums for the insurance are paid and there's an insurance section in the city budget.

1634
02:20:07,154 --> 02:20:08,075
[SPEAKER_25]: There's a group insurance.

1635
02:20:08,815 --> 02:20:09,916
[SPEAKER_25]: That's part of the city budget.

1636
02:20:10,297 --> 02:20:15,441
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm not sure of any other insurance type of, there are, I, we could, I could talk to you about it after the meeting.

1637
02:20:15,581 --> 02:20:15,942
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

1638
02:20:16,082 --> 02:20:17,443
[SPEAKER_25]: I'd love to know because it seems like,

1639
02:20:18,274 --> 02:20:19,416
[SPEAKER_25]: Nobody knows where this money's coming from.

1640
02:20:19,456 --> 02:20:27,127
[SPEAKER_25]: If it's an insurance company, then I don't know how we're still getting covered by this insurance company and what type of policy that we're paying into.

1641
02:20:27,387 --> 02:20:29,810
[SPEAKER_25]: I thought we were self-insured in that regard.

1642
02:20:30,672 --> 02:20:31,333
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Mr. Jones.

1643
02:20:31,573 --> 02:20:31,873
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

1644
02:20:31,893 --> 02:20:33,255
[SPEAKER_25]: Appreciate the answer.

1645
02:20:33,295 --> 02:20:33,576
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1646
02:20:37,611 --> 02:20:42,115
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Villes isn't wrong that the line item for the legal department is correct.

1647
02:20:42,715 --> 02:20:45,037
[SPEAKER_29]: But the warrant articles that we have, I'll give you an example.

1648
02:20:45,638 --> 02:20:48,040
[SPEAKER_29]: I have them all right here because I have them ready.

1649
02:20:48,820 --> 02:20:52,023
[SPEAKER_29]: And from month to month, I could break it down with you.

1650
02:20:52,063 --> 02:20:56,647
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm coming with you tomorrow, Mr. Jones, and I'll show you, I'll give you an example right off the bat, which was alarming.

1651
02:20:57,187 --> 02:20:58,308
[SPEAKER_29]: In June of 2023,

1652
02:21:00,808 --> 02:21:10,817
[SPEAKER_29]: the city of method paid KP law through the warrant articles, not in the law, not in the law item in different, different departments over $230,000 just for that one month.

1653
02:21:11,317 --> 02:21:15,761
[SPEAKER_29]: So I will come and I'll share this information with you just to see council bears isn't wrong.

1654
02:21:16,481 --> 02:21:20,044
[SPEAKER_29]: The line item for the legal department isn't, they take exactly what they're supposed to.

1655
02:21:20,084 --> 02:21:20,465
[SPEAKER_29]: It's correct.

1656
02:21:21,081 --> 02:21:25,285
[SPEAKER_29]: But the Warren articles that we get month to month, you could see the breakdown.

1657
02:21:25,305 --> 02:21:31,850
[SPEAKER_29]: You could see the expenditures to KP law for different departments for hundreds of thousands of dollars.

1658
02:21:32,111 --> 02:21:32,311
[SPEAKER_25]: Right.

1659
02:21:32,571 --> 02:21:32,911
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1660
02:21:33,151 --> 02:21:33,792
[SPEAKER_25]: I understand that.

1661
02:21:33,832 --> 02:21:37,195
[SPEAKER_25]: But what line item in the departments are they coming from?

1662
02:21:37,895 --> 02:21:38,336
[SPEAKER_25]: I'll bring it.

1663
02:21:38,416 --> 02:21:38,796
[SPEAKER_25]: I'll bring it.

1664
02:21:38,876 --> 02:21:40,036
[SPEAKER_25]: You can break it down yourself.

1665
02:21:41,837 --> 02:21:46,019
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not meant to be a back and forth.

1666
02:21:46,039 --> 02:21:49,721
[SPEAKER_25]: I think it should because we're talking about millions of dollars that nobody knows where they're going.

1667
02:21:49,761 --> 02:21:52,803
[SPEAKER_24]: We do literally audited in the city ward articles.

1668
02:21:52,863 --> 02:21:53,343
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1669
02:21:53,623 --> 02:21:54,203
[SPEAKER_24]: We do.

1670
02:21:54,223 --> 02:22:01,287
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not accurate.

1671
02:22:02,427 --> 02:22:02,668
[SPEAKER_24]: All right.

1672
02:22:02,728 --> 02:22:05,289
[SPEAKER_24]: Is there any further discussion on the item regarding the school superintendent?

1673
02:22:09,845 --> 02:22:12,767
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1674
02:22:12,967 --> 02:22:18,793
[SPEAKER_19]: I understand that the, the resolution at hand is not.

1675
02:22:19,654 --> 02:22:22,396
[SPEAKER_19]: meant particularly in ill will.

1676
02:22:23,197 --> 02:22:37,407
[SPEAKER_19]: Having been on a superintendent search committee before, I just worry that this past City Council saying this, passing this, hinders the ability of that body to perform its duties with confidence.

1677
02:22:38,268 --> 02:22:42,531
[SPEAKER_19]: I understand that it's, in my view, this is

1678
02:22:44,192 --> 02:22:46,093
[SPEAKER_19]: testing the waters with separation of powers.

1679
02:22:47,253 --> 02:22:49,274
[SPEAKER_19]: And so that's why I plan to vote no on this.

1680
02:22:53,676 --> 02:22:54,957
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Councilor Senna.

1681
02:22:57,198 --> 02:23:00,499
[SPEAKER_24]: And I just did pull up the Mass General Law, Chapter 43, Section 22.

1682
02:23:02,703 --> 02:23:06,267
[SPEAKER_24]: which was invoked by Councilor Scarpelli in June.

1683
02:23:07,889 --> 02:23:21,325
[SPEAKER_24]: I did seek legal counsel advice after my interpretation of that rule, and I would just say again, legal counsel essentially informed me that any member can postpone any resolution, motion, or order for any reason if they want to.

1684
02:23:23,167 --> 02:23:25,128
[SPEAKER_24]: It's chapter 43, section 22.

1685
02:23:25,828 --> 02:23:26,848
[SPEAKER_24]: He said rule 21.

1686
02:23:29,629 --> 02:23:30,009
[SPEAKER_24]: He didn't.

1687
02:23:30,109 --> 02:23:30,470
[SPEAKER_24]: He didn't.

1688
02:23:30,650 --> 02:23:31,010
[SPEAKER_24]: He didn't.

1689
02:23:31,210 --> 02:23:31,910
[SPEAKER_24]: Correct.

1690
02:23:32,030 --> 02:23:33,151
[SPEAKER_29]: But he said rule 21.

1691
02:23:33,211 --> 02:23:33,431
[SPEAKER_29]: Right.

1692
02:23:33,811 --> 02:23:41,794
[SPEAKER_29]: And I'm glad you figured out what you made a mistake by when I invoked rule 21.

1693
02:23:42,094 --> 02:23:43,054
[SPEAKER_24]: I sought further opinion.

1694
02:23:43,074 --> 02:23:43,714
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

1695
02:23:44,154 --> 02:23:45,295
[SPEAKER_29]: I appreciate it.

1696
02:23:47,247 --> 02:23:54,613
[SPEAKER_24]: I will say some other lawyers disagree with the interpretation of council, but I will go with the interpretation of the city's legal council, even if I don't agree with it.

1697
02:24:04,361 --> 02:24:07,244
[SPEAKER_24]: Any further discussion on the motion?

1698
02:24:07,264 --> 02:24:09,406
[SPEAKER_24]: Is there a motion to approve?

1699
02:24:09,426 --> 02:24:15,651
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion of Councilor Collins to approve

1700
02:24:16,186 --> 02:24:22,129
[SPEAKER_24]: Paper 24-518A regarding the school superintendent's contract, seconded by?

1701
02:24:24,731 --> 02:24:25,911
[SPEAKER_24]: Seconded by Councilor Gallagher.

1702
02:24:25,951 --> 02:24:26,992
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1703
02:24:30,534 --> 02:24:43,881
[SPEAKER_24]: This is now the be it resolved that the school department respond, report back to the council the information of the cost associated with terminating the school superintendent's contract and the anticipated costs of the superintendent search committee and interim appointment.

1704
02:24:49,292 --> 02:24:49,772
[SPEAKER_36]: You ready for me?

1705
02:24:50,213 --> 02:24:50,513
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes.

1706
02:24:51,653 --> 02:24:52,254
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Callahan.

1707
02:24:54,615 --> 02:24:55,416
[SPEAKER_36]: Vice President Collins.

1708
02:24:57,097 --> 02:24:57,937
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Lazzaro.

1709
02:24:59,338 --> 02:24:59,859
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Leming.

1710
02:25:00,479 --> 02:25:00,719
[SPEAKER_33]: No.

1711
02:25:02,420 --> 02:25:03,141
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1712
02:25:03,381 --> 02:25:03,581
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes.

1713
02:25:04,301 --> 02:25:04,782
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Tseng.

1714
02:25:04,802 --> 02:25:04,842
[SPEAKER_36]: No.

1715
02:25:06,723 --> 02:25:07,303
[SPEAKER_36]: President Bears.

1716
02:25:07,884 --> 02:25:08,964
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

1717
02:25:08,984 --> 02:25:10,725
[SPEAKER_24]: Three in the affirmative, four in the negative.

1718
02:25:10,745 --> 02:25:15,448
[SPEAKER_24]: The motion fails.

1719
02:25:15,568 --> 02:25:15,989
[SPEAKER_24]: 254518B.

1720
02:25:16,149 --> 02:25:18,170
[SPEAKER_24]: This is regarding the bond rating.

1721
02:25:20,460 --> 02:25:21,942
[SPEAKER_24]: Do we want to amend that to something else?

1722
02:25:22,202 --> 02:25:25,224
[SPEAKER_24]: You had said earlier, Councilor Scarpel, you wanted to amend that to request a meeting?

1723
02:25:33,611 --> 02:25:44,741
[SPEAKER_24]: So this is amended to be resolved that the City Council requests a report on why the bond rating was temporarily rescinded.

1724
02:25:47,170 --> 02:25:49,111
[SPEAKER_24]: On that motion by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by.

1725
02:25:49,812 --> 02:25:50,953
[SPEAKER_24]: Seconded by Councilor Tseng.

1726
02:25:50,973 --> 02:25:52,154
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1727
02:25:52,374 --> 02:25:52,714
[SPEAKER_36]: Hang on.

1728
02:26:12,268 --> 02:26:12,848
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Callahan.

1729
02:26:12,868 --> 02:26:12,928
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes.

1730
02:26:14,409 --> 02:26:15,170
[SPEAKER_36]: Vice President Collins.

1731
02:26:16,476 --> 02:26:18,861
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Lazzaro, Councilor Leming.

1732
02:26:19,402 --> 02:26:19,623
[SPEAKER_49]: No.

1733
02:26:21,627 --> 02:26:22,328
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1734
02:26:22,709 --> 02:26:22,849
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes.

1735
02:26:23,531 --> 02:26:23,972
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Tseng.

1736
02:26:23,992 --> 02:26:24,052
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes.

1737
02:26:24,893 --> 02:26:25,455
[SPEAKER_36]: President Ferris.

1738
02:26:25,535 --> 02:26:27,739
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, 60 affirmative, one of the negative, the motion passes.

1739
02:26:30,192 --> 02:26:48,039
[SPEAKER_24]: 24-518-C which is be it resolved that the city administration cease and desist the use of private investigators to follow and harass employees utilizing contractually afforded leave benefits be it further resolved the city administration report back to the council with the identified line in the budget where we are paying private investigators in a complete financial report from the start of this practice to the present.

1740
02:26:49,940 --> 02:26:50,800
[SPEAKER_24]: Any further discussion?

1741
02:26:55,622 --> 02:26:56,262
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Callahan.

1742
02:27:00,785 --> 02:27:09,790
[SPEAKER_37]: I would be in favor of something that was not exactly this, but that requested from the administration to understand what is our policy?

1743
02:27:10,471 --> 02:27:11,971
[SPEAKER_37]: What is the reason which we are doing this?

1744
02:27:12,212 --> 02:27:16,774
[SPEAKER_37]: I mean, for me, both of these last two paragraphs are, I will say,

1745
02:27:19,184 --> 02:27:24,847
[SPEAKER_37]: I hope we have a really good reason if we are doing either of these things.

1746
02:27:24,867 --> 02:27:35,472
[SPEAKER_37]: I looked a little bit into different state laws, in different states, different state laws on drug testing, for example.

1747
02:27:36,632 --> 02:27:41,374
[SPEAKER_37]: And it has to be only under certain circumstances.

1748
02:27:43,436 --> 02:27:52,576
[SPEAKER_37]: So I think for me, I really want to have an explanation of what our policy is as a city for both of these.

1749
02:27:54,289 --> 02:28:15,654
[SPEAKER_37]: And if we are doing either of these, what the reasoning is behind it, I don't think that I am completely ready to vote yes on this before I have more information, a flat-out cease and desist, although it does, like, I mean, hearing the language, you know,

1750
02:28:16,714 --> 02:28:20,558
[SPEAKER_37]: may seem attractive, but before I have more information, I'm not willing to vote yes on it.

1751
02:28:20,918 --> 02:28:30,647
[SPEAKER_37]: I would vote yes if this were amended to say we want to know a full policy, we want to understand, you know, when this is used, and then the cost as well.

1752
02:28:33,484 --> 02:28:48,818
[SPEAKER_29]: If that would help to get the information that we're looking for, I would be amenable to changing the language so we can get some information through the administration to see if these are the practices and if they are where we stand as a council.

1753
02:28:49,518 --> 02:28:52,501
[SPEAKER_29]: So I would be willing to make those amendments.

1754
02:28:52,881 --> 02:28:53,201
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1755
02:28:53,622 --> 02:28:55,884
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Callahan, could you articulate those amendments?

1756
02:28:56,186 --> 02:29:23,313
[SPEAKER_37]: let me do my best to request that the city administration provide its policy regarding the use of private investigators with regards to any city all any or all its city employees and then I'm okay with the second sentence be it further resolved that the city administration report back with the identified line items in the budget

1757
02:29:45,023 --> 02:29:46,124
[SPEAKER_24]: Any further discussion on the item?

1758
02:29:47,344 --> 02:29:47,845
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Tseng?

1759
02:29:49,406 --> 02:29:51,447
[SPEAKER_19]: I agree with Councilor Callahan.

1760
02:29:52,407 --> 02:29:54,228
[SPEAKER_19]: I wanted to chime in and request that.

1761
02:29:54,649 --> 02:29:58,311
[SPEAKER_19]: I wasn't comfortable, and I am not, I'm not comfortable with

1762
02:29:59,318 --> 02:30:04,680
[SPEAKER_19]: with language that I think is overstepped that line, the separation of powers line.

1763
02:30:06,100 --> 02:30:11,782
[SPEAKER_19]: And this is the way that it was worded in the first place, I think, overstepped that line.

1764
02:30:13,143 --> 02:30:16,064
[SPEAKER_19]: I appreciate your suggested amendments.

1765
02:30:17,116 --> 02:30:23,318
[SPEAKER_19]: And I agree with what you said about, we should have a very good reason for why we're doing things like this.

1766
02:30:23,558 --> 02:30:38,561
[SPEAKER_19]: We should, but it's not our role as a council to step in and say what we can or can't do and compel a mayor to do something that's within her charter right to do.

1767
02:30:39,262 --> 02:30:40,602
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll talk about charter review next year.

1768
02:30:41,822 --> 02:30:47,826
[SPEAKER_19]: But I think we need to follow the letter of the law, and I'm much more comfortable with the amendment.

1769
02:30:50,709 --> 02:30:53,571
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan, if you have more comments, Councilor Callahan.

1770
02:30:54,175 --> 02:30:54,535
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

1771
02:30:54,955 --> 02:31:19,942
[SPEAKER_37]: If I may, I have to say, I am overall, whenever I have looked into specific questions, things like how much free cash we get at the end of the budget year, and whether that is something that is viewed by the state of Massachusetts, by bond agencies, et cetera, as is that something positive or negative?

1772
02:31:20,942 --> 02:31:26,445
[SPEAKER_37]: There are other things that I have looked into that the city has done that have been questions about what the city is doing.

1773
02:31:26,725 --> 02:31:43,913
[SPEAKER_37]: And when I've looked into very specific things like those, I am usually, I find that what, or for example, the other one is like creating capital stabilization funds, these sorts of things, I have found that

1774
02:31:45,928 --> 02:31:54,096
[SPEAKER_37]: the city administration is actually doing things that are considered, in those two cases, considered best practice by the state of Massachusetts.

1775
02:31:56,018 --> 02:31:59,161
[SPEAKER_37]: And that being said,

1776
02:32:03,135 --> 02:32:25,453
[SPEAKER_37]: I, if, if we were a city council where I genuinely believed that the mayor or the administration were doing something that I disagreed with, even if it were the purview of the mayor, I, as a city Councilor, I would feel comfortable making a motion that says the city council does not agree with X, Y, Z practice if that were the case.

1777
02:32:26,014 --> 02:32:31,398
[SPEAKER_37]: Um, so I just want to make it clear that I don't think that we as a city council are

1778
02:32:31,918 --> 02:32:38,562
[SPEAKER_37]: in any way trapped against saying what we believe our opinion of what the administration should be doing is.

1779
02:32:38,602 --> 02:32:40,403
[SPEAKER_37]: I think that we can say the same thing to Tufts.

1780
02:32:40,423 --> 02:32:44,386
[SPEAKER_37]: We can't control Tufts, but we sure can say we wish Tufts were doing something different.

1781
02:32:44,606 --> 02:32:46,027
[SPEAKER_37]: We would like Tufts to do something different.

1782
02:32:46,047 --> 02:32:49,409
[SPEAKER_37]: I think we can say that to the administration.

1783
02:32:49,769 --> 02:32:56,233
[SPEAKER_37]: So a slight disagreement, I think, with my fellow Councilor, or maybe not, but if I was understanding you correctly.

1784
02:32:57,293 --> 02:33:10,656
[SPEAKER_37]: I just think I don't have the information, and I really want to have a lot more information before I make any kind of decision on something that would say something so strongly worded as that.

1785
02:33:12,616 --> 02:33:17,697
[SPEAKER_37]: But I'm happy that I think we're going to get a wording change, and we'll be able to get a little more information.

1786
02:33:17,917 --> 02:33:21,078
[SPEAKER_19]: Just to quickly clarify, that's not completely correct.

1787
02:33:21,098 --> 02:33:22,338
[SPEAKER_19]: I meant a compulsion order.

1788
02:33:22,358 --> 02:33:25,699
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that's over the line.

1789
02:33:26,761 --> 02:33:29,944
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, I don't think we have the authority to require the cease and desist.

1790
02:33:30,945 --> 02:33:31,125
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

1791
02:33:33,987 --> 02:33:35,749
[SPEAKER_24]: Any further discussion on this item as amended?

1792
02:33:37,891 --> 02:33:38,652
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Lazzaro.

1793
02:33:39,773 --> 02:33:47,119
[SPEAKER_40]: Sorry, can you just repeat what the amended for me, what the amended motion was?

1794
02:33:47,199 --> 02:33:48,801
[SPEAKER_36]: Mr. Clerk, whatever you have.

1795
02:33:50,100 --> 02:34:06,570
[SPEAKER_36]: What I have is a request that the administration provide a policy regarding use of private investigators with regard to any and all city employees and have the administration report back with the identified line item in the budget from which that expenditure is made.

1796
02:34:10,046 --> 02:34:10,746
[SPEAKER_24]: Does that sound about right?

1797
02:34:11,887 --> 02:34:12,127
[SPEAKER_24]: Great.

1798
02:34:13,148 --> 02:34:21,732
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion by Councilor Scarpelli as amended by Councilor Callahan as seconded by Councilor Collins.

1799
02:34:22,572 --> 02:34:23,533
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1800
02:34:31,697 --> 02:34:39,181
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Callahan, Vice President Collins, Councilor Lazzaro, Councilor Leming,

1801
02:34:39,793 --> 02:34:40,113
[SPEAKER_35]: Yes.

1802
02:34:41,735 --> 02:34:42,495
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1803
02:34:43,656 --> 02:34:44,197
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Tseng.

1804
02:34:44,857 --> 02:34:45,438
[SPEAKER_36]: President Bears.

1805
02:34:45,758 --> 02:34:45,978
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

1806
02:34:45,998 --> 02:34:47,119
[SPEAKER_24]: I have any affirmative, none the negative.

1807
02:34:47,139 --> 02:34:48,000
[SPEAKER_24]: The motion passes.

1808
02:34:49,461 --> 02:35:03,493
[SPEAKER_24]: 24 518 D be resolved by the city of minutes that the city administration report to the council, the costs associated for questionable drug testing of DPW staff and report outlining the reasons for these tests and for the result of the council request to move to executive session.

1809
02:35:04,074 --> 02:35:05,335
[SPEAKER_24]: If these issues are confidential.

1810
02:35:07,976 --> 02:35:09,737
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Scarpelli, then Councilor Callahan.

1811
02:35:10,657 --> 02:35:23,399
[SPEAKER_29]: If you want to look at this process and make sure that the wording is correct, just to get some information, the truth of the matter is just understanding the cost impact on drug tests for DPW employees.

1812
02:35:25,020 --> 02:35:26,460
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1813
02:35:26,600 --> 02:35:27,480
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Callahan.

1814
02:35:28,420 --> 02:35:34,162
[SPEAKER_37]: I actually, to be honest, I would like to know what our drug policy testing is for all city employees.

1815
02:35:36,806 --> 02:35:39,667
[SPEAKER_29]: and report back what our drug policies are for all city employees.

1816
02:35:40,467 --> 02:35:40,987
[SPEAKER_29]: It's a good idea.

1817
02:35:42,108 --> 02:35:43,568
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1818
02:35:43,588 --> 02:35:53,611
[SPEAKER_24]: So it sounds like the amended resolution is being resolved that the council requests the administration report on the city's drug policy and the cost of drug testing of employees.

1819
02:35:53,992 --> 02:35:54,152
[SPEAKER_24]: Right.

1820
02:35:55,152 --> 02:35:55,452
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

1821
02:35:56,532 --> 02:35:56,832
Thank you.

1822
02:35:57,053 --> 02:35:58,353
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Clerk, when you have that, let me know.

1823
02:36:09,198 --> 02:36:09,999
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Kelly.

1824
02:36:10,741 --> 02:36:18,914
[SPEAKER_37]: I do think that the reasons for these particular tests, I would be interested in that as well.

1825
02:36:18,934 --> 02:36:19,835
[SPEAKER_24]: I'll be honest.

1826
02:36:19,855 --> 02:36:22,119
[SPEAKER_24]: I do not believe that we will ever receive that information.

1827
02:36:23,340 --> 02:36:25,681
[SPEAKER_24]: And I personally do not feel comfortable asking for it.

1828
02:36:26,021 --> 02:36:34,885
[SPEAKER_37]: I honestly I think that we might because of the reading that I did on drug testing in different states in the United States.

1829
02:36:35,806 --> 02:36:43,429
[SPEAKER_37]: There are certain, there are only certain times that it can be done, it is not at the whim of the mayor or anyone else in the city.

1830
02:36:43,809 --> 02:36:49,493
[SPEAKER_37]: there, you know, it falls into certain categories where it is legal and then other categories where it is not legal.

1831
02:36:49,714 --> 02:36:55,338
[SPEAKER_37]: So I imagine that we will, we will get an answer that at least will fall into like some vague category.

1832
02:36:55,418 --> 02:36:56,279
[SPEAKER_37]: And I would be happy with that.

1833
02:36:56,679 --> 02:36:57,439
[SPEAKER_24]: What are Councilors saying?

1834
02:36:57,459 --> 02:37:09,789
[SPEAKER_19]: Then Councilor Scarpelli from my reading, from my legal reading and research into this, there are splits between different federal courts, state courts, circuit splits on this particular issue for when it comes to public employees.

1835
02:37:10,828 --> 02:37:12,930
[SPEAKER_19]: There are public and private factors to weigh.

1836
02:37:14,533 --> 02:37:17,437
[SPEAKER_19]: That's all to say it's actually very not clear-cut.

1837
02:37:17,577 --> 02:37:25,187
[SPEAKER_19]: There are restrictions on the government's ability to do this, of course, but it's not very clear-cut.

1838
02:37:27,270 --> 02:37:28,271
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1839
02:37:28,291 --> 02:37:34,274
[SPEAKER_29]: I think the union representative was very clear in the process and the policies when to be drug tested.

1840
02:37:34,314 --> 02:37:45,540
[SPEAKER_29]: So, um, regardless what the federal laws are, but there are agreements and laws that were made, uh, in, in negotiation to make sure that these weren't violated.

1841
02:37:45,580 --> 02:37:52,263
[SPEAKER_29]: So I think that the mayor has that, uh, to be honest with you, that would be very clear and understandable for everybody here.

1842
02:37:52,883 --> 02:37:54,004
[SPEAKER_29]: Cause she definitely violated that.

1843
02:37:55,205 --> 02:38:07,851
[SPEAKER_24]: I would just note that regardless of any of that, this is very clearly the subject of litigation and the city will reply that because it's the subject of litigation, they're not going to be providing any information that could be detrimental to their case.

1844
02:38:08,191 --> 02:38:10,732
[SPEAKER_24]: So if we could stick to things

1845
02:38:11,758 --> 02:38:12,818
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, great.

1846
02:38:12,958 --> 02:38:21,021
[SPEAKER_24]: So we're going to stick to the drug policy and the cost associated with drug testing employees.

1847
02:38:21,742 --> 02:38:22,022
[SPEAKER_24]: Great.

1848
02:38:23,202 --> 02:38:28,684
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, as amended by Councilor Callahan, I seconded by.

1849
02:38:31,325 --> 02:38:32,566
[SPEAKER_24]: Seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.

1850
02:38:32,626 --> 02:38:33,606
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1851
02:38:41,067 --> 02:38:48,050
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Callahan, Vice President Collins, Councilor Lazzaro, Councilor Leming.

1852
02:38:48,431 --> 02:38:48,711
[SPEAKER_35]: Yes.

1853
02:38:50,692 --> 02:38:54,053
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Tseng, President Bears.

1854
02:38:54,794 --> 02:38:55,054
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

1855
02:38:57,375 --> 02:38:59,036
[SPEAKER_24]: Senator, another negative motion passes.

1856
02:38:59,056 --> 02:39:02,137
[SPEAKER_24]: 24-519, be it resolved that the city

1857
02:39:09,993 --> 02:39:28,120
[SPEAKER_24]: City Administration give an update on the request of meeting to review the report compiled Medford Fire Department report compiled by the consultants of the City Council voted approve for its funding for the resolve that the administration include Fire Chief and MFD Union leadership to review the report and be prepared to meet an executive session to have a discussion with its findings.

1858
02:39:29,320 --> 02:39:30,101
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1859
02:40:00,195 --> 02:40:00,775
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1860
02:40:00,995 --> 02:40:01,836
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Callahan.

1861
02:40:01,856 --> 02:40:04,738
[SPEAKER_37]: I wanna have some clarification.

1862
02:40:04,758 --> 02:40:06,940
[SPEAKER_37]: Um the requested meeting.

1863
02:40:07,280 --> 02:40:14,286
[SPEAKER_37]: So, I'm assuming this is a meeting between the administration and the fire department that you're talking about.

1864
02:40:14,326 --> 02:40:15,747
[SPEAKER_37]: Like, can you be a little bit more clear?

1865
02:40:16,007 --> 02:40:23,694
[SPEAKER_29]: Council asked for when we had the the chief chief Evans here when we talked about the

1866
02:40:27,145 --> 02:40:31,048
[SPEAKER_29]: And the report then was presented to the deputies and the chief.

1867
02:40:31,849 --> 02:40:38,114
[SPEAKER_29]: And we were waiting on a meeting to inform the council of what their findings were with that meeting.

1868
02:40:39,115 --> 02:40:47,681
[SPEAKER_37]: So you're asking that the meeting with the council also include the fire chief and the union leadership.

1869
02:40:47,922 --> 02:40:48,662
[SPEAKER_29]: The administration.

1870
02:40:49,923 --> 02:40:53,366
[SPEAKER_37]: But that if there needs to be an executive session, we would have that without those folks.

1871
02:40:56,711 --> 02:41:01,553
[SPEAKER_29]: they would be included in that executive session because you're bringing them in to discuss personal.

1872
02:41:02,193 --> 02:41:03,774
[SPEAKER_29]: They have to be there for talking about that.

1873
02:41:03,894 --> 02:41:07,376
[SPEAKER_29]: So that's the intent of executive session.

1874
02:41:08,236 --> 02:41:10,517
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm not sure what the executive session exemption would be.

1875
02:41:10,577 --> 02:41:12,578
[SPEAKER_24]: I think we're going to have to consult council on that.

1876
02:41:19,660 --> 02:41:22,624
[SPEAKER_24]: I believe we move forward with this resolution.

1877
02:41:22,664 --> 02:41:24,466
[SPEAKER_24]: Did we make a motion to request a meeting?

1878
02:41:24,886 --> 02:41:26,128
[SPEAKER_24]: We did that that evening.

1879
02:41:26,368 --> 02:41:26,809
[SPEAKER_24]: That evening.

1880
02:41:26,889 --> 02:41:27,309
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

1881
02:41:28,130 --> 02:41:29,912
[SPEAKER_24]: That was a motion that we've got nothing back.

1882
02:41:30,753 --> 02:41:32,836
[SPEAKER_24]: And this is a motion to request a meeting.

1883
02:41:32,856 --> 02:41:38,222
[SPEAKER_24]: Request an update on the meeting requests regarding the MRI report for the fire department.

1884
02:41:38,262 --> 02:41:38,522
[SPEAKER_29]: Correct.

1885
02:41:41,485 --> 02:41:59,877
[SPEAKER_29]: And the second piece, Council President, if you want to leave it open-ended, after consulting the legal team, that we then have the ability to go to executive sessions so they see fit, or they deem it approved.

1886
02:42:00,566 --> 02:42:00,766
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

1887
02:42:00,806 --> 02:42:02,807
[SPEAKER_24]: So, amend to the second session to be that.

1888
02:42:02,827 --> 02:42:03,348
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

1889
02:42:03,568 --> 02:42:12,393
[SPEAKER_24]: Uh the council will, council leadership will speak to the city's legal council to determine if there's a valid executive session.

1890
02:42:12,413 --> 02:42:12,533
[SPEAKER_24]: Option.

1891
02:42:13,313 --> 02:42:13,674
[SPEAKER_24]: Option.

1892
02:42:13,794 --> 02:42:14,094
[SPEAKER_24]: Got it.

1893
02:42:14,234 --> 02:42:14,514
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

1894
02:42:15,635 --> 02:42:16,175
[SPEAKER_24]: I'll go to

1895
02:42:19,866 --> 02:42:21,127
[SPEAKER_40]: I support this.

1896
02:42:21,187 --> 02:42:22,488
[SPEAKER_40]: I think that that would be great.

1897
02:42:23,429 --> 02:42:29,273
[SPEAKER_40]: I would also say if it would make sense, we could hold it in the public health and community safety committee.

1898
02:42:29,313 --> 02:42:36,159
[SPEAKER_40]: And then if we could leave the committee to executive session, I don't know if that's common, but that way we would avoid any open meeting on violations.

1899
02:42:36,179 --> 02:42:46,847
[SPEAKER_40]: I don't know if that's, if this meeting would be in open, in an open session or not, but the, it seems to me as a community, as a public safety,

1900
02:42:47,688 --> 02:42:56,995
[SPEAKER_40]: organization, the fire department, we could do it in committee if that makes more sense.

1901
02:42:58,536 --> 02:43:14,849
[SPEAKER_29]: I think that the process that this council's totality voted to fund this report and having an open forum, having the report presented to the public and then go to executive session through open meeting

1902
02:43:15,447 --> 02:43:15,667
[SPEAKER_24]: Right.

1903
02:43:15,687 --> 02:43:15,848
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

1904
02:43:15,888 --> 02:43:18,031
[SPEAKER_24]: All of all meetings have to start as open meetings.

1905
02:43:18,091 --> 02:43:30,688
[SPEAKER_29]: So, but as a committee, a committee, a meeting with all the, all the members of this council, because they think that committee of the whole versus the public health and safety committee, I'd rather, I'd rather that if that was the option.

1906
02:43:31,508 --> 02:43:31,788
[SPEAKER_24]: All right.

1907
02:43:31,968 --> 02:43:38,832
[SPEAKER_24]: So this is a motion to request an update on the requested meeting, uh, to review the MRI report regarding the Medford fire department.

1908
02:43:39,672 --> 02:43:54,040
[SPEAKER_24]: And the amended resolution is to, uh, request a committee of the whole meeting and to determine on advice of legal counsel, uh, whether or not, uh, the city council can enter executive session to discuss elements of that report.

1909
02:43:54,120 --> 02:43:54,460
[SPEAKER_29]: Perfect.

1910
02:43:54,521 --> 02:43:54,861
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

1911
02:43:55,101 --> 02:43:55,361
[SPEAKER_29]: All right.

1912
02:43:58,217 --> 02:44:05,163
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, as amended by Councilor Lazzaro, as seconded by Councilor Tseng, is there any further discussion by members of the Council?

1913
02:44:05,703 --> 02:44:07,585
[SPEAKER_24]: Seeing none, we'll go to public participation.

1914
02:44:07,945 --> 02:44:09,186
[SPEAKER_24]: Name and address for the record, please.

1915
02:44:09,206 --> 02:44:10,107
[SPEAKER_24]: You have three minutes.

1916
02:44:11,408 --> 02:44:19,075
[SPEAKER_25]: I say, Mayor Sridhar, I believe the night that we, the Council so graciously appropriated the money for this report, I requested a copy of the report.

1917
02:44:19,395 --> 02:44:20,976
[SPEAKER_25]: I have not seen one as of yet.

1918
02:44:21,156 --> 02:44:25,440
[SPEAKER_25]: Plain and simple, the union would like a seat at the table to see what the consultant

1919
02:44:26,300 --> 02:44:32,062
[SPEAKER_25]: decided when information was discussed and what we need to do to move forward.

1920
02:44:32,382 --> 02:44:35,584
[SPEAKER_25]: As of yet, we have not seen anything from the report.

1921
02:44:36,284 --> 02:44:38,305
[SPEAKER_25]: Just asking the union has a seat at the table.

1922
02:44:38,685 --> 02:44:39,365
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you very much.

1923
02:44:39,385 --> 02:44:49,129
[SPEAKER_24]: Uh, just to clarify, has that not been provided with?

1924
02:44:49,189 --> 02:44:50,509
[SPEAKER_25]: No, I have not seen anything.

1925
02:44:50,909 --> 02:44:52,490
[SPEAKER_25]: I'd like to be a present at the meeting.

1926
02:44:52,510 --> 02:44:52,750
[SPEAKER_25]: Union

1927
02:44:53,337 --> 02:44:54,418
[SPEAKER_25]: union leadership.

1928
02:44:54,898 --> 02:44:56,219
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, it'll be a public meeting.

1929
02:44:56,259 --> 02:44:57,460
[SPEAKER_24]: So you can absolutely be present.

1930
02:44:57,880 --> 02:44:58,461
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

1931
02:44:59,181 --> 02:45:01,503
[SPEAKER_24]: And the report is public record.

1932
02:45:01,543 --> 02:45:02,143
[SPEAKER_24]: It was sent to us.

1933
02:45:02,203 --> 02:45:03,184
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm happy to forward it to you.

1934
02:45:03,504 --> 02:45:04,245
[SPEAKER_25]: That would be great.

1935
02:45:04,545 --> 02:45:04,765
[SPEAKER_24]: Great.

1936
02:45:05,626 --> 02:45:09,008
[SPEAKER_24]: I believe there's any issues with the name tells us have any issues with that.

1937
02:45:09,769 --> 02:45:10,009
[SPEAKER_24]: Great.

1938
02:45:10,149 --> 02:45:10,769
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1939
02:45:12,310 --> 02:45:13,671
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, it's still Yeah.

1940
02:45:16,073 --> 02:45:17,534
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't think a further amendment is needed.

1941
02:45:21,706 --> 02:45:23,607
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, no, it's it's public record.

1942
02:45:23,667 --> 02:45:24,488
[SPEAKER_24]: It's public document.

1943
02:45:30,353 --> 02:45:31,974
[SPEAKER_24]: And you have you have a copy of that, correct?

1944
02:45:32,014 --> 02:45:32,755
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1945
02:45:34,036 --> 02:45:34,336
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

1946
02:45:34,616 --> 02:45:34,876
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright.

1947
02:45:36,598 --> 02:45:36,978
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1948
02:45:38,379 --> 02:45:38,980
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion.

1949
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:41,061
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1950
02:45:46,306 --> 02:45:47,006
[SPEAKER_24]: I believe the second was

1951
02:45:52,341 --> 02:45:54,083
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Lazzaro Bennett and Councilor Tseng is the second.

1952
02:45:54,103 --> 02:45:54,483
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1953
02:46:00,967 --> 02:46:01,587
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Callahan.

1954
02:46:04,409 --> 02:46:05,249
[SPEAKER_36]: Vice President Collins.

1955
02:46:05,890 --> 02:46:06,710
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Lazzaro.

1956
02:46:07,491 --> 02:46:08,031
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Leming.

1957
02:46:08,652 --> 02:46:08,952
[SPEAKER_35]: Yes.

1958
02:46:10,273 --> 02:46:11,033
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1959
02:46:11,173 --> 02:46:11,313
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes.

1960
02:46:12,354 --> 02:46:12,914
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Tseng.

1961
02:46:13,094 --> 02:46:13,234
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes.

1962
02:46:13,975 --> 02:46:14,575
[SPEAKER_36]: President Bears.

1963
02:46:15,116 --> 02:46:15,336
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

1964
02:46:17,179 --> 02:46:21,202
[SPEAKER_24]: 7 affirmative, none negative, the motion passes.

1965
02:46:21,222 --> 02:46:22,843
[SPEAKER_24]: 24490, this is a continued public hearing.

1966
02:46:23,363 --> 02:46:27,947
[SPEAKER_24]: We open this public hearing on December 3rd, 2024 in our regular meeting.

1967
02:46:27,987 --> 02:46:31,289
[SPEAKER_24]: This is regarding the Mystic Avenue Corridor District zoning.

1968
02:46:33,030 --> 02:46:35,092
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm reopening the public hearing now.

1969
02:46:37,543 --> 02:46:39,424
[SPEAKER_24]: We did receive a report.

1970
02:46:39,744 --> 02:46:40,365
[SPEAKER_24]: This was reported.

1971
02:46:41,045 --> 02:46:43,487
[SPEAKER_24]: Recommendations were reported to us from the community development board.

1972
02:46:44,807 --> 02:46:47,629
[SPEAKER_24]: So we have Mystic Avenue corridor district in front of us.

1973
02:46:51,891 --> 02:46:58,515
[SPEAKER_24]: And with that, I will entertain any motions or discussion from the council before we hear from members of the public in the public hearing.

1974
02:47:00,557 --> 02:47:01,297
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1975
02:47:02,592 --> 02:47:21,371
[SPEAKER_29]: that I know that had a great discussion with our director, that there were some questions with the process of notification in our processes through the city council, whether they were done legally, and they are.

1976
02:47:23,113 --> 02:47:24,715
[SPEAKER_29]: Unfortunately, the software that we have

1977
02:47:25,461 --> 02:47:31,025
[SPEAKER_29]: When the resolution is opened and moves forward, it's not written out in totality.

1978
02:47:31,045 --> 02:47:37,950
[SPEAKER_29]: So people didn't see that tonight's would be the final vote for Mystic Ave rezoning.

1979
02:47:39,672 --> 02:47:52,141
[SPEAKER_29]: We're informed that the process was done correctly and that if there is a way that we can look in the future to try to share that information to make sure that there aren't any questions moving forward, I think that'll be helpful.

1980
02:47:52,472 --> 02:48:00,459
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, it is in page six of the packet here, public hearing notices, it's amendments to add the Mystic Avenue corridor district.

1981
02:48:00,579 --> 02:48:07,685
[SPEAKER_24]: And we've now have joint advertising of community development board and zoning city council public hearings.

1982
02:48:07,785 --> 02:48:13,190
[SPEAKER_24]: So we opened this hearing on December 3rd and it was continued by a vote of the council to today's meeting.

1983
02:48:16,113 --> 02:48:18,375
[SPEAKER_24]: Council Vice President Collins and then Councilor Kelly.

1984
02:48:20,316 --> 02:48:20,496
[SPEAKER_18]: Great.

1985
02:48:20,816 --> 02:48:21,617
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Bears.

1986
02:48:22,858 --> 02:48:25,801
[SPEAKER_18]: And I do appreciate the discussion, the clarity around the noticing.

1987
02:48:25,881 --> 02:48:30,866
[SPEAKER_18]: I think especially with these zoning ordinances, I think the process is clear, but it's complicated.

1988
02:48:30,926 --> 02:48:38,113
[SPEAKER_18]: It's one of those things that is wonky and technical and it has to procedurally, legally, it must kind of go from body to body.

1989
02:48:38,493 --> 02:48:42,477
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think it's really understandable that, you know, there's for

1990
02:48:42,984 --> 02:48:46,070
[SPEAKER_18]: folks who aren't intimately familiar with the zoning referral process.

1991
02:48:46,130 --> 02:48:48,614
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not intuitive, and that makes a lot of sense.

1992
02:48:48,915 --> 02:48:54,084
[SPEAKER_18]: And due to, you know, continued collaboration, especially between members of the planning and permitting committee,

1993
02:48:54,778 --> 02:49:17,539
[SPEAKER_18]: We're kind of continually trying to make sure that we're messaging these meetings ever better and making it easier for folks to know where we are in the process and I think that this is an easy thing that we can add to kind of the increased levels of communication and flyering that we're doing around our ongoing zoning work just to try and do what we can to make this important, technical, complicated, you know, very interesting process a little more legible for

1994
02:49:19,040 --> 02:49:20,321
[SPEAKER_18]: just regular folks in the community.

1995
02:49:21,902 --> 02:49:34,451
[SPEAKER_18]: Having said that, just if you'll indulge me for just a little bit of retrospective before I make a motion, really excited that Mystic Avenue Corridor District zoning proposal has come back to the City Council tonight.

1996
02:49:34,671 --> 02:49:40,615
[SPEAKER_18]: It's taken, you know, as with any zoning proposal, it's taken a thorough and storied road to get here.

1997
02:49:42,176 --> 02:49:44,137
[SPEAKER_18]: We had a mapping workshop back in July.

1998
02:49:44,217 --> 02:50:04,525
[SPEAKER_18]: We decided that Mystic Avenue Corridor District was going to be one of the first things that we took a deep dive into because, you know, between our housing production plan, between our comprehensive plan, from so many comments that me and my colleagues have received from constituents over the years talking about just, it's so visible, I think for so many people, the untapped potential on Mystic Ave.

1999
02:50:05,665 --> 02:50:10,107
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that the kind of, there was a very clear vision for how we could do more.

2000
02:50:11,334 --> 02:50:15,295
[SPEAKER_18]: even more with this really valuable property in Medford and Leverage.

2001
02:50:15,515 --> 02:50:16,955
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a transit corridor.

2002
02:50:17,235 --> 02:50:18,215
[SPEAKER_18]: There's some really big lots.

2003
02:50:18,896 --> 02:50:21,096
[SPEAKER_18]: It's good for a lot of things and we should be doing more with it.

2004
02:50:21,436 --> 02:50:34,459
[SPEAKER_18]: This council has been really focused on doing what we can to try and set the stage for more commercial development so that we are building our commercial tax base as much as possible and having that trickle into things like schools and roads and public services.

2005
02:50:36,559 --> 02:50:40,202
[SPEAKER_18]: So we began our discussions of the Mystic Avenue Corridor District in August.

2006
02:50:40,282 --> 02:50:47,686
[SPEAKER_18]: We workshopped it for a couple months with city staff, with our zoning consultant in committee, receiving feedback from the community.

2007
02:50:48,467 --> 02:50:50,128
[SPEAKER_18]: We looked at a lot of different options.

2008
02:50:50,148 --> 02:50:51,068
[SPEAKER_18]: We took in feedback.

2009
02:50:51,108 --> 02:50:52,769
[SPEAKER_18]: We made tweaks after committee.

2010
02:50:52,909 --> 02:50:54,430
[SPEAKER_18]: It was referred to the Community Development Board.

2011
02:50:54,710 --> 02:50:59,994
[SPEAKER_18]: It came back to us tonight with some recommendations to just further tweak it and make it

2012
02:51:02,859 --> 02:51:23,552
[SPEAKER_18]: more legible for developers, make more sense, be easier to understand, and just be easier to achieve some of the requirements, incentives that we're really hoping that developers will take us up on on Mystic App, so that we'll both get great development along Mystic App that's in the line of what the community really wants to see there, but is also, you know, simple and clear enough that

2013
02:51:24,733 --> 02:51:25,554
[SPEAKER_18]: People can look at it.

2014
02:51:25,614 --> 02:51:30,361
[SPEAKER_18]: Residents can look at it and developers can look at and say, OK, it's obvious to me what they want.

2015
02:51:30,381 --> 02:51:36,390
[SPEAKER_18]: It's obvious to me how to meet these requirements so that we can partner with the city to do more on this to have.

2016
02:51:40,555 --> 02:51:48,603
[SPEAKER_18]: Having said that, I think, you know, happy to have more of a discussion on the specific amendments that the CD board is recommending that we adopt tonight.

2017
02:51:49,584 --> 02:51:50,504
[SPEAKER_18]: They are in our packets.

2018
02:51:51,305 --> 02:52:03,136
[SPEAKER_18]: I think they're pretty straightforward and intuitive tweaks, but I would motion to approve for first reading the Mystic Avenue Corridor District zoning proposal and adopt the recommended amendments.

2019
02:52:05,078 --> 02:52:20,215
[SPEAKER_18]: by the Community Development Board, as well as to change the special permit granting authority on cannabis uses to the ZBA and to change the special permit granting authority on adult uses to the City Council to maintain consistency with the rest of the zoning ordinance.

2020
02:52:21,897 --> 02:52:22,397
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2021
02:52:22,497 --> 02:52:24,680
[SPEAKER_24]: And just for clarification, those last two items are

2022
02:52:25,959 --> 02:52:28,720
[SPEAKER_24]: keeping in how it is currently in the ordinance.

2023
02:52:29,060 --> 02:52:31,741
[SPEAKER_24]: And there was just a typographic error in the final document.

2024
02:52:32,141 --> 02:52:34,582
[SPEAKER_24]: Great, I'm seeing a nod from the- That is correct.

2025
02:52:34,602 --> 02:52:35,882
[SPEAKER_24]: Director of Planning, Development and Sustainability.

2026
02:52:35,902 --> 02:52:37,002
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

2027
02:52:37,202 --> 02:52:39,543
[SPEAKER_24]: Is there a second on the motion by Councilor Collins?

2028
02:52:40,843 --> 02:52:41,564
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Tseng?

2029
02:52:45,625 --> 02:52:48,205
[SPEAKER_24]: This is for final approval because there's not three readings on zoning.

2030
02:52:49,546 --> 02:52:49,706
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

2031
02:52:50,990 --> 02:52:52,871
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, technically there's like five readings on zoning.

2032
02:52:54,031 --> 02:52:54,912
[SPEAKER_24]: And this is the end of it.

2033
02:52:54,932 --> 02:52:57,553
[SPEAKER_24]: There's a lot of public hearings on zoning.

2034
02:52:58,513 --> 02:53:04,435
[SPEAKER_24]: So I will go to Councilor Callahan, Councilor Tseng, Councilor Scarpelli.

2035
02:53:05,376 --> 02:53:07,036
[SPEAKER_24]: Sorry, Councilor Callahan, Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Tseng.

2036
02:53:07,236 --> 02:53:07,916
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Callahan.

2037
02:53:07,976 --> 02:53:08,757
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

2038
02:53:09,137 --> 02:53:09,977
[SPEAKER_37]: I apologize.

2039
02:53:10,557 --> 02:53:12,698
[SPEAKER_37]: I don't see where the zoning board.

2040
02:53:12,718 --> 02:53:15,099
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm on page six.

2041
02:53:15,139 --> 02:53:15,920
[SPEAKER_24]: That's the hearing.

2042
02:53:16,300 --> 02:53:19,781
[SPEAKER_24]: The documents were distributed to the council by email and are attached online.

2043
02:53:21,323 --> 02:53:22,143
[SPEAKER_37]: They're not in the pocket.

2044
02:53:22,464 --> 02:53:23,304
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, they were not.

2045
02:53:23,764 --> 02:53:24,465
[SPEAKER_37]: My computer is dead.

2046
02:53:24,725 --> 02:53:37,693
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah.

2047
02:53:37,833 --> 02:53:39,414
[SPEAKER_37]: So, I see page six, I see.

2048
02:53:39,434 --> 02:53:40,675
[SPEAKER_37]: That's it.

2049
02:53:40,715 --> 02:53:42,356
[SPEAKER_24]: Just go to the, that's the hearing notice.

2050
02:53:42,416 --> 02:53:43,777
[SPEAKER_24]: Go under the meeting files.

2051
02:53:44,237 --> 02:53:45,518
[SPEAKER_24]: You see them under the meeting files.

2052
02:53:50,354 --> 02:54:02,759
[SPEAKER_24]: I'll go to Director Hunt to describe the Community Development Board memorandum.

2053
02:54:02,799 --> 02:54:05,901
[SPEAKER_24]: We also do have Danielle Evans still with us at this point.

2054
02:54:05,941 --> 02:54:07,001
[SPEAKER_24]: If you want to go to Danielle.

2055
02:54:07,942 --> 02:54:08,422
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2056
02:54:09,482 --> 02:54:10,803
[SPEAKER_14]: Danielle and I are communicating.

2057
02:54:10,843 --> 02:54:14,604
[SPEAKER_14]: She's available for questions but said she was happy to have me speak since I was here in the room.

2058
02:54:14,745 --> 02:54:15,605
[SPEAKER_24]: Thanks for sticking it out.

2059
02:54:17,554 --> 02:54:18,854
[SPEAKER_14]: Pardon me if I'm a little punchy.

2060
02:54:19,714 --> 02:54:23,976
[SPEAKER_14]: So the recommendations of the Community Development Board were pretty straightforward.

2061
02:54:25,016 --> 02:54:30,878
[SPEAKER_14]: We changed up the table of development incentives for the affordable housing.

2062
02:54:31,458 --> 02:54:35,740
[SPEAKER_14]: The way it was written was very confusing and was very hard to interpret.

2063
02:54:36,140 --> 02:54:41,702
[SPEAKER_14]: And so what we did was turned it into a table format that is a little bit easier to understand.

2064
02:54:41,762 --> 02:54:43,703
[SPEAKER_14]: It was actually a recommendation that came from the

2065
02:54:44,683 --> 02:54:45,804
[SPEAKER_14]: our consultant.

2066
02:54:46,204 --> 02:54:52,367
[SPEAKER_14]: And in fact, if you saw the Salem Street zoning in our public meetings, it's the table that you saw in the Salem Street.

2067
02:54:52,427 --> 02:54:54,628
[SPEAKER_14]: So we've been kind of leapfrogging each other.

2068
02:54:55,089 --> 02:55:00,912
[SPEAKER_14]: So because we figured it out in between, it had to come as a CD board recommendation.

2069
02:55:01,952 --> 02:55:04,634
[SPEAKER_14]: The other changes, I believe, are all things you saw in that

2070
02:55:05,674 --> 02:55:20,266
[SPEAKER_14]: the development bonuses that we're removing certified as LEED Gold or equivalent standard for as an incentive because that's almost essentially required by our building code right now.

2071
02:55:20,426 --> 02:55:24,189
[SPEAKER_14]: And so we would be giving them a floor for doing something they kind of have to do anyhow.

2072
02:55:24,670 --> 02:55:33,617
[SPEAKER_14]: But we kept to meet LEED Platinum or equivalent and as one floor,

2073
02:55:34,477 --> 02:55:42,679
[SPEAKER_14]: And what we are saying is that we change the word certified to certifiable because you don't get certified until a year after the building is open.

2074
02:55:44,000 --> 02:55:48,501
[SPEAKER_14]: And in fact, we don't literally care if they get the plaque, we care that they meet all the standards.

2075
02:55:49,461 --> 02:55:53,222
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's changing that language from certified to certifiable.

2076
02:55:55,929 --> 02:56:07,377
[SPEAKER_14]: Another thing that had gotten carried over, so these are the same incentives that were in the zoning that we did for the Wellington area MBTA zoning.

2077
02:56:07,817 --> 02:56:15,262
[SPEAKER_14]: And one of them we weren't allowed to make required in that area was to have 75% of the ground floor as commercial.

2078
02:56:15,382 --> 02:56:22,547
[SPEAKER_14]: So we were in that neighborhood in Wellington giving an extra floor to incentivize it because it was MBTA zoning.

2079
02:56:23,027 --> 02:56:28,971
[SPEAKER_14]: In this area, we're actually requiring 75% active first floor throughout.

2080
02:56:29,451 --> 02:56:36,175
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're not giving it again, we had to, that was essentially a typo, we were not giving a bonus for something that's required.

2081
02:56:37,596 --> 02:56:37,976
[SPEAKER_14]: And then

2082
02:56:39,644 --> 02:56:40,025
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, yes.

2083
02:56:40,485 --> 02:56:41,586
[SPEAKER_14]: Dimensional waivers.

2084
02:56:43,247 --> 02:56:45,709
[SPEAKER_14]: It came to our attention that there might be opportunities.

2085
02:56:45,749 --> 02:56:48,991
[SPEAKER_14]: So we actually in this zoning have a minimum height as well as a max.

2086
02:56:49,712 --> 02:57:02,241
[SPEAKER_14]: And so we said with a special permit, the CD board should be able to waive the minimum height requirement because you might have a fantastic project that everybody wants to see, but it's not going to be three stories high.

2087
02:57:03,321 --> 02:57:15,744
[SPEAKER_14]: And so that in the languages there, that if it's consistent with the purpose of the district and the goals of the Medford Comprehensive Plan, the board could waive the minimum height requirement.

2088
02:57:16,864 --> 02:57:22,366
[SPEAKER_14]: And those are the recommendations from the board on this.

2089
02:57:22,606 --> 02:57:27,347
[SPEAKER_14]: And then, yes, Councilor Collins caught the typos that we had.

2090
02:57:27,587 --> 02:57:28,707
[SPEAKER_29]: It's in height, not stories.

2091
02:57:30,068 --> 02:57:31,808
[SPEAKER_14]: There are height and stories.

2092
02:57:32,432 --> 02:57:36,094
[SPEAKER_29]: So the recommended is height though, and best practice is height?

2093
02:57:36,754 --> 02:57:40,796
[SPEAKER_14]: So we actually are doing a minimum of three stories.

2094
02:57:41,656 --> 02:57:44,397
[SPEAKER_14]: And I believe there's a minimum height in there as well.

2095
02:57:44,418 --> 02:57:46,418
[SPEAKER_29]: So it shows both?

2096
02:57:49,520 --> 02:57:49,700
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2097
02:57:51,161 --> 02:57:51,301
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.

2098
02:57:52,681 --> 02:57:53,202
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

2099
02:57:53,342 --> 02:57:53,682
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2100
02:57:53,962 --> 02:57:56,463
[SPEAKER_14]: The minimum for height is only in stories.

2101
02:57:57,083 --> 02:58:00,505
[SPEAKER_14]: The maximums are in height and stories.

2102
02:58:02,136 --> 02:58:12,543
[SPEAKER_14]: So how many, sorry, the amount of stories you, sorry, my brain, I apologize.

2103
02:58:12,623 --> 02:58:13,043
[SPEAKER_14]: It is late.

2104
02:58:13,564 --> 02:58:18,907
[SPEAKER_14]: The height for a ground floor story has a minimum of 14 feet and a maximum of 18 feet.

2105
02:58:19,428 --> 02:58:23,571
[SPEAKER_14]: For an upper floor story, a minimum of 10 feet and a maximum of 12 feet.

2106
02:58:23,611 --> 02:58:27,473
[SPEAKER_14]: So there is in fact maximum heights, but it's per story.

2107
02:58:27,853 --> 02:58:31,136
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not like you could just make one 30-story first floor.

2108
02:58:32,036 --> 02:58:35,099
[SPEAKER_14]: And frankly, somebody said to us, but what about the Great American Beer Hall?

2109
02:58:35,499 --> 02:58:36,260
[SPEAKER_14]: It's amazing.

2110
02:58:36,620 --> 02:58:40,283
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of one story and like kind of like it's got a balcony.

2111
02:58:40,383 --> 02:58:42,024
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, how would you consider that?

2112
02:58:42,445 --> 02:58:52,453
[SPEAKER_14]: And I said, we said, well, actually, maybe for the really great projects that have a really great design and make sense, you shouldn't hold them so strictly to some of these items.

2113
02:58:53,467 --> 02:58:56,848
[SPEAKER_14]: But overall, for design and look and feel, you would want to do that.

2114
02:58:57,848 --> 02:58:59,168
[SPEAKER_14]: So those were the things.

2115
02:58:59,248 --> 02:59:06,570
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the typos that we caught with regards to who is the permit granting authority.

2116
02:59:07,151 --> 02:59:12,652
[SPEAKER_24]: And generally, you're talking about situations where projects would already be undergoing a special permit process or site plan review?

2117
02:59:14,245 --> 02:59:19,970
[SPEAKER_14]: It is so we have minimum of 10,000 square feet building goes to site plan review.

2118
02:59:20,370 --> 02:59:26,015
[SPEAKER_14]: So it is a high expectation that projects along this corridor will end up in site plan review.

2119
02:59:26,295 --> 02:59:26,695
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2120
02:59:27,476 --> 02:59:28,497
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Scarpelli, anything else?

2121
02:59:30,285 --> 02:59:36,088
[SPEAKER_29]: I just, I know that we've been, I'm going to be redundant and I know that this is my, my cry from the beginning.

2122
02:59:36,968 --> 02:59:42,670
[SPEAKER_29]: Um, and I know the director has tried and we've, we've talked about this and informing the public.

2123
02:59:42,710 --> 02:59:53,375
[SPEAKER_29]: I know we've done, um, you know, what you feel is due diligence, but I'm going to stick with what, what this council prior really wanted to see was really bringing

2124
02:59:54,028 --> 02:59:55,449
[SPEAKER_29]: these meetings to the neighborhoods.

2125
02:59:56,550 --> 03:00:15,529
[SPEAKER_29]: When I did talk to residents of the corridor and business owners, and I know that you've corrected me a few times and said, George, we put it in the water bill, we've gone directly to the businesses, but the members that have reached out to me, the neighbors that I've talked to,

2126
03:00:16,451 --> 03:00:18,092
[SPEAKER_29]: truly don't understand the process still.

2127
03:00:18,132 --> 03:00:20,013
[SPEAKER_29]: And I think that there are some restrictions.

2128
03:00:20,053 --> 03:00:23,155
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, when you look at our zoning process, we still, we're only Zoom.

2129
03:00:24,075 --> 03:00:25,216
[SPEAKER_29]: So that really hurts.

2130
03:00:26,296 --> 03:00:28,097
[SPEAKER_29]: So people really can't get involved.

2131
03:00:28,137 --> 03:00:34,681
[SPEAKER_29]: And I think, again, I think this is my biggest battle is that

2132
03:00:35,393 --> 03:00:38,454
[SPEAKER_29]: As we're moving forward, I really would like to see us go into the neighborhoods.

2133
03:00:38,474 --> 03:00:41,696
[SPEAKER_29]: I know Innes said they would look to see if it's possible to do that.

2134
03:00:41,736 --> 03:00:46,798
[SPEAKER_29]: I know that that was part of the RFP that I read that we looked at back in the day when we first started this process.

2135
03:00:46,818 --> 03:00:56,142
[SPEAKER_29]: So again, I just think that's important, especially when you're making these changes that we haven't done in 100 years, that residents feel like they've been listened to.

2136
03:00:56,342 --> 03:00:58,563
[SPEAKER_29]: I know that we've done a lot of listening sessions.

2137
03:00:59,023 --> 03:01:00,283
[SPEAKER_29]: We've had a lot of meetings.

2138
03:01:00,843 --> 03:01:04,505
[SPEAKER_29]: But again, I think that that last piece, I feel, is a big void.

2139
03:01:04,878 --> 03:01:10,081
[SPEAKER_29]: I think that we need to go to the neighborhood, and I'm gonna stand on my soapbox to the end with that.

2140
03:01:10,121 --> 03:01:11,421
[SPEAKER_29]: So thank you for listening.

2141
03:01:12,462 --> 03:01:13,362
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

2142
03:01:13,463 --> 03:01:15,584
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm gonna go back to Councilor Callahan, then to Councilor Sanz.

2143
03:01:17,465 --> 03:01:17,725
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

2144
03:01:18,525 --> 03:01:32,713
[SPEAKER_37]: The one change I would additionally like to make is I am hoping, I know that we have not had a chance yet to discuss co-living, which as far as I understand it is really just people who are not related to each other living, renting an apartment.

2145
03:01:33,753 --> 03:01:38,975
[SPEAKER_37]: And I feel a little bit uncomfortable with the fact that that is disallowed in certain sections of MSTICAV.

2146
03:01:39,355 --> 03:01:46,077
[SPEAKER_37]: So I'm hoping that we can just remove that definition and everywhere it appears for this particular approval tonight.

2147
03:01:46,217 --> 03:01:48,758
[SPEAKER_37]: And that'll give us time to talk about it.

2148
03:01:48,878 --> 03:01:50,419
[SPEAKER_37]: And we can always add that definition later.

2149
03:01:50,439 --> 03:01:54,660
[SPEAKER_37]: I don't think it's going to delay anything or be problematic to simply remove that.

2150
03:01:54,900 --> 03:01:56,521
[SPEAKER_37]: But I'd love to ask you your opinion.

2151
03:01:56,581 --> 03:01:57,481
[SPEAKER_37]: Do you think that we could just

2152
03:01:58,813 --> 03:02:15,544
[SPEAKER_14]: For this evening, I think it would be simpler to say strike line A8 of the use table, and that way it wouldn't be explicitly allowed, it wouldn't be specifically not allowed, and then we can sort of work out the clear understandings of what that means.

2153
03:02:15,844 --> 03:02:17,486
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, I would also just note, I don't think that

2154
03:02:19,577 --> 03:02:24,021
[SPEAKER_24]: people who are unrelated are allowed to live in an apartment regardless of whether co-living as a specific use is allowed or not.

2155
03:02:24,041 --> 03:02:24,582
[SPEAKER_24]: Right.

2156
03:02:25,383 --> 03:02:27,685
[SPEAKER_24]: But okay, is that a motion to strike line A8?

2157
03:02:27,705 --> 03:02:28,786
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, thank you.

2158
03:02:28,806 --> 03:02:36,693
[SPEAKER_24]: There's an amendment motion to add to the motion of Councilor Collins to strike line A8 from the use table by Councilor Callahan.

2159
03:02:36,713 --> 03:02:38,014
[SPEAKER_24]: Is there a second?

2160
03:02:38,034 --> 03:02:40,456
[SPEAKER_24]: All right.

2161
03:02:40,476 --> 03:02:42,939
[SPEAKER_24]: Is there any, I guess really, is there any opposition to that amendment?

2162
03:02:44,167 --> 03:02:46,708
[SPEAKER_24]: Seeing none, that'll be included in Councilor Collins' motion.

2163
03:02:47,928 --> 03:02:48,709
[SPEAKER_24]: Any further discussion?

2164
03:02:48,729 --> 03:02:49,669
[SPEAKER_24]: I'll go to Councilor Tseng.

2165
03:02:52,590 --> 03:02:52,930
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

2166
03:02:54,231 --> 03:03:00,133
[SPEAKER_19]: I want to thank you for your hard work on this, to thank the team at Innis Associates for their hard work.

2167
03:03:01,254 --> 03:03:09,537
[SPEAKER_19]: I know a lot of us on the City Council have been working really hard, but I do want to give a special shout out to our planning and permitting committee.

2168
03:03:10,897 --> 03:03:13,158
[SPEAKER_19]: this is a huge, huge deal for our city.

2169
03:03:14,359 --> 03:03:19,341
[SPEAKER_19]: Any zoning change is, but this one is one of many that are coming.

2170
03:03:20,201 --> 03:03:35,267
[SPEAKER_19]: I know people in the neighborhood who are very excited about this, and especially with this being one of the corridors into the heart of our city, one of the gateways into our city, to have a more thriving scene there, to have more

2171
03:03:37,188 --> 03:03:41,650
[SPEAKER_19]: business in Medford to have more residences in Medford, these are all good things.

2172
03:03:42,971 --> 03:03:47,833
[SPEAKER_19]: When we consider the environmental impact that this will have, this is a really great thing for the environment.

2173
03:03:48,174 --> 03:04:00,059
[SPEAKER_19]: When we make changes like this, and you know, this is a reckoning that a lot of cities have been having, is that we can actually win on housing, we can win on the environment, we can win on business development.

2174
03:04:00,480 --> 03:04:03,821
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think this is one of those proposals that will move our city in the right direction.

2175
03:04:03,841 --> 03:04:05,002
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm very grateful for this.

2176
03:04:05,502 --> 03:04:08,925
[SPEAKER_19]: I think this is something that we should celebrate as a city.

2177
03:04:09,726 --> 03:04:15,731
[SPEAKER_19]: It's great to be ending the year with something like this, and I very happily support this.

2178
03:04:16,631 --> 03:04:18,033
[SPEAKER_24]: Great, thank you.

2179
03:04:18,673 --> 03:04:23,317
[SPEAKER_24]: As I noted, the public hearing is open unless there's any further comments by members of the Council or Director Hunt.

2180
03:04:24,578 --> 03:04:31,704
[SPEAKER_24]: The public hearing is open and we can hear from anyone who is in favor or opposed or otherwise has comments on this proposal.

2181
03:04:31,724 --> 03:04:33,766
[SPEAKER_24]: You can come to the podium and you'll have three minutes.

2182
03:04:35,259 --> 03:04:39,241
[SPEAKER_43]: Hi, my name is Lisa Serio, Lisa Vienneau, and I come from 19 Paul Road.

2183
03:04:39,861 --> 03:04:47,265
[SPEAKER_43]: I was just wondering, when you design a neighborhood, what values are you looking for?

2184
03:04:47,325 --> 03:04:49,826
[SPEAKER_43]: Like, are you looking for resourcefulness?

2185
03:04:49,946 --> 03:04:51,427
[SPEAKER_43]: Are you looking for safety?

2186
03:04:51,447 --> 03:05:01,251
[SPEAKER_43]: I mean, I'm just thinking, we're designing a neighborhood, you call it a corridor or whatever it is, but like, don't you like want to know what the value of

2187
03:05:02,523 --> 03:05:15,700
[SPEAKER_43]: Like what you're trying to bring to the neighborhood like we want it to be safe, and we wanted to just seems like you're designing stuff beer gardens this that I don't know what the value is I'm trying to figure out like.

2188
03:05:16,496 --> 03:05:33,203
[SPEAKER_43]: What are you looking for what do you want in method, I'm trying to see if we could find common ground on what we value, like in a neighborhood, safety, shared shared areas where children and older people and younger people can.

2189
03:05:33,623 --> 03:05:34,324
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm just trying to.

2190
03:05:34,944 --> 03:05:46,490
[SPEAKER_43]: figure out like why I have like reservations on the Salem Street and the Mystic Ave because I can't find common values.

2191
03:05:47,070 --> 03:05:52,112
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm looking for the common value on this and I just don't know what you value.

2192
03:05:52,372 --> 03:05:55,474
[SPEAKER_43]: It seems like you just pop things up and it's like, you know,

2193
03:05:56,613 --> 03:05:57,594
[SPEAKER_43]: What are you bringing?

2194
03:05:57,674 --> 03:05:58,974
[SPEAKER_43]: Where's the neighborhood?

2195
03:05:59,034 --> 03:06:01,136
[SPEAKER_43]: Like, that's kind of like my question.

2196
03:06:01,176 --> 03:06:08,140
[SPEAKER_43]: I don't, with all of the stuff that you're doing, I'm just trying to figure out what are we trying to achieve?

2197
03:06:08,960 --> 03:06:18,266
[SPEAKER_43]: That's all, I'm just, I know it's 100 years old and it's gotta be modernized and all this, but I just don't see, I don't see the common ground.

2198
03:06:18,286 --> 03:06:19,907
[SPEAKER_43]: I think that's a problem.

2199
03:06:19,987 --> 03:06:21,748
[SPEAKER_43]: I don't know, just my thought.

2200
03:06:22,969 --> 03:06:23,329
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2201
03:06:25,978 --> 03:06:32,143
[SPEAKER_24]: And I would just point to the city's comprehensive plan talks about shared vision and values for the future.

2202
03:06:32,163 --> 03:06:36,807
[SPEAKER_24]: That's the document where a lot of the zoning comes from.

2203
03:06:37,568 --> 03:06:39,990
[SPEAKER_24]: Name and address for the record, please name, you have three minutes.

2204
03:06:40,643 --> 03:06:43,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street.

2205
03:06:44,305 --> 03:06:47,067
[SPEAKER_04]: I reviewed the zoning, pardon my blindness.

2206
03:06:48,348 --> 03:07:05,058
[SPEAKER_04]: And what stuck out to me was, I couldn't find the answer to this question, which is, what commercial to residential ratio is required on this corridor, not only for it to be self-sufficient from a taxation standpoint, but to also provide a net benefit to the city finances?

2207
03:07:05,638 --> 03:07:11,640
[SPEAKER_04]: As we all know, heavy residential is detrimental to municipal finances without guardrails in place.

2208
03:07:12,040 --> 03:07:13,760
[SPEAKER_04]: There seem to be no guardrails.

2209
03:07:14,020 --> 03:07:27,844
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you add hundreds of units of housing here with very small first floor commercial, a little coffee shop or something, we're going to find ourself in a bad financial situation because we're not going to be able to afford this density.

2210
03:07:28,324 --> 03:07:32,625
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm wondering why that was not considered since we paid an outside consultant.

2211
03:07:33,586 --> 03:07:33,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2212
03:07:34,426 --> 03:07:34,726
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2213
03:07:37,128 --> 03:07:38,189
[SPEAKER_24]: Name and address for the record, please.

2214
03:07:38,209 --> 03:07:38,889
[SPEAKER_24]: You have three minutes.

2215
03:07:39,650 --> 03:07:41,331
[SPEAKER_34]: Jamie Thompson, 86 Lawrence Road.

2216
03:07:41,751 --> 03:07:52,660
[SPEAKER_34]: I just want to follow up with Councilor Scarpelli's comment about getting into the communities, especially with the upcoming zoning for Salem Street, West Medford, Medford Square.

2217
03:07:53,800 --> 03:08:01,366
[SPEAKER_34]: And then separately, as a representative from the Medford Chamber of Commerce, just wanted to read in a letter that they put together, but they weren't able to submit in time.

2218
03:08:02,607 --> 03:08:06,290
[SPEAKER_34]: Dear Medford City Council, the Medford Chamber of Commerce is encouraged by the

2219
03:08:06,806 --> 03:08:09,177
[SPEAKER_34]: proposed zoning changes aimed at fostering.

2220
03:08:09,197 --> 03:08:11,989
[SPEAKER_24]: Jamie, if you could get a little closer to the microphone and we're going to turn you up a little bit.

2221
03:08:13,438 --> 03:08:20,220
[SPEAKER_34]: The Medford Chamber of Commerce is encouraged by the proposed zoning changes aimed at fostering commercial development and strengthening the Medford business community.

2222
03:08:20,740 --> 03:08:26,782
[SPEAKER_34]: These efforts represent an important step forward, taking Medford a more attractive and accessible place for businesses to grow and thrive.

2223
03:08:27,582 --> 03:08:36,465
[SPEAKER_34]: However, as plans as the Mystic Ave corridor district move forward, it is essential to ensure that existing locally owned small businesses in the area are supported and included in the discussion.

2224
03:08:37,285 --> 03:08:49,073
[SPEAKER_34]: The current restrictions and in some cases outright prohibitions on parking facilities pose significant challenges for these businesses, many of which are already struggling to meet customer parking demands, specifically in the mixed use three zone.

2225
03:08:49,674 --> 03:08:56,939
[SPEAKER_34]: We strongly recommend that non residential parking garages and additional parking areas be permitted to better accommodate businesses neighbors and their customers.

2226
03:08:57,799 --> 03:09:08,088
[SPEAKER_34]: Furthermore, the Mystic Avenue corridor district's proximity to I-93 offers a unique opportunity to attract and serve drivers seeking convenient access to local food and business establishments.

2227
03:09:08,668 --> 03:09:12,812
[SPEAKER_34]: Unfortunately, the current prohibition on drive-thru facilities undermines this potential.

2228
03:09:13,453 --> 03:09:19,238
[SPEAKER_34]: Allowing drive-thru options would enable businesses to better cater to highway travelers and capitalize on the district's prime location.

2229
03:09:19,915 --> 03:09:22,377
[SPEAKER_34]: Mystic Avenue already has multiple drive-thru businesses.

2230
03:09:22,777 --> 03:09:28,421
[SPEAKER_34]: We respectfully request that the drive-thru prohibition be reconsidered or removed.

2231
03:09:28,862 --> 03:09:30,163
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you for consideration.

2232
03:09:30,643 --> 03:09:33,125
[SPEAKER_34]: Laura O'Neill, Executive Director, Medford Chamber of Commerce.

2233
03:09:34,066 --> 03:09:34,346
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2234
03:09:36,387 --> 03:09:37,188
[SPEAKER_24]: Any further comments?

2235
03:09:37,668 --> 03:09:38,669
[SPEAKER_24]: Name and address for the record, please.

2236
03:09:38,709 --> 03:09:39,430
[SPEAKER_24]: You have three minutes.

2237
03:09:41,550 --> 03:09:45,874
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Josh Eckert Lee 347 Main Street, just near the corridor.

2238
03:09:47,034 --> 03:09:50,537
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm also a planner, I love this plan I think it's really impressive.

2239
03:09:51,278 --> 03:10:00,866
[SPEAKER_21]: I have to have one question and first, just a response to that comment from the Chamber of Commerce, I think prohibitions on parking are essential for

2240
03:10:01,826 --> 03:10:04,668
[SPEAKER_21]: safe and multimodal transit across our city.

2241
03:10:04,748 --> 03:10:10,272
[SPEAKER_21]: I would really love to see even more aggressive parking regulations to keep me.

2242
03:10:10,352 --> 03:10:11,513
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, sorry, Director Hunt.

2243
03:10:14,075 --> 03:10:22,641
[SPEAKER_21]: More parking regulations and more support for us as pedestrians and cyclists in the city is welcomed and encouraged completely.

2244
03:10:23,853 --> 03:10:24,153
[SPEAKER_21]: Truly.

2245
03:10:24,954 --> 03:10:34,558
[SPEAKER_21]: And I just want to also ask for additional clarification on the low-income solar co-op program that is discussed, but given a sort of to-be-continued point in the table.

2246
03:10:35,046 --> 03:10:36,047
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, I'm happy to answer that.

2247
03:10:36,107 --> 03:10:42,793
[SPEAKER_24]: We're going to be considering the community solar program as the discussion and the zoning project continues.

2248
03:10:42,833 --> 03:10:47,198
[SPEAKER_24]: We need to look into some specifics on it, but the plan is to include it.

2249
03:10:48,058 --> 03:10:57,748
[SPEAKER_24]: Right now, I'm actually taking some information provided to me from some community activists, providing it to the zoning team that's working on this, and then it's likely that that, excuse me, will be included.

2250
03:10:59,051 --> 03:11:02,452
[SPEAKER_24]: as an incentive piece across all of the districts where there's incentive zoning.

2251
03:11:02,472 --> 03:11:03,892
[SPEAKER_24]: We just want to get it right.

2252
03:11:05,053 --> 03:11:05,333
[SPEAKER_24]: Thanks.

2253
03:11:09,994 --> 03:11:14,435
[SPEAKER_24]: Any further comment on this public hearing?

2254
03:11:15,816 --> 03:11:17,256
[SPEAKER_24]: Name and address for the record, please.

2255
03:11:17,396 --> 03:11:18,476
[SPEAKER_24]: And you have three minutes.

2256
03:11:19,537 --> 03:11:21,797
[SPEAKER_03]: Paulette Vardabedian, Central Ave, Medford.

2257
03:11:21,937 --> 03:11:26,999
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to make a very strong suggestion that when this may be,

2258
03:11:28,038 --> 03:11:30,340
[SPEAKER_03]: moving forward beyond this meeting.

2259
03:11:30,640 --> 03:11:40,066
[SPEAKER_03]: But when we look for contractors for this upcoming, whether it's Salem Street or Mystic Ave, that we do much more due diligence in who we're working with.

2260
03:11:40,667 --> 03:11:47,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Because from what I've gathered, both the methadone dispensary and this

2261
03:11:49,386 --> 03:11:49,586
[SPEAKER_03]: St.

2262
03:11:49,626 --> 03:12:04,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Francis proposal, the people that we were planning to work with were undesirable, have bad reputations, or had no prior knowledge or experience with the project that they were going to work on.

2263
03:12:05,100 --> 03:12:10,866
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we are choosing what builders we're going to work with, et cetera, I hope that we

2264
03:12:11,286 --> 03:12:23,228
[SPEAKER_03]: don't just go with the cheapest one and we go with the one that is the best suited for our community and that has a good reputation and is able to work with us and again, not just the cheapest one.

2265
03:12:23,529 --> 03:12:23,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

2266
03:12:25,209 --> 03:12:25,889
[SPEAKER_24]: Uh thank you, Paulette.

2267
03:12:25,909 --> 03:12:28,770
[SPEAKER_24]: I just want to note both of those projects were private projects.

2268
03:12:28,870 --> 03:12:37,771
[SPEAKER_24]: So, the private property owner decided who they wanted to work with and then they were the ones who submitted the plans to the city and and the city doesn't have any choice as to who we would get to

2269
03:12:40,751 --> 03:12:43,243
[SPEAKER_24]: representing private property owners and they are allowed to.

2270
03:12:43,803 --> 03:12:50,226
[SPEAKER_24]: petition the city within the zoning ordinance and the Massachusetts general laws for whatever they need to do on their private property.

2271
03:12:50,267 --> 03:12:51,247
[SPEAKER_24]: So, so we don't have any.

2272
03:12:51,827 --> 03:12:58,131
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have, we don't have any right to refuse a company that has a horrible reputation.

2273
03:12:58,151 --> 03:13:00,212
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to bring them into our community.

2274
03:13:00,332 --> 03:13:02,473
[SPEAKER_24]: Only the private property landowner has the right.

2275
03:13:02,553 --> 03:13:10,377
[SPEAKER_24]: They have their unlimited right to choose who they want to represent them when making petitions to the city regarding permits, licenses, et cetera.

2276
03:13:10,417 --> 03:13:11,538
[SPEAKER_24]: We don't have any control over that.

2277
03:13:11,638 --> 03:13:27,581
[SPEAKER_03]: So the only thing we would do is to, um, if we didn't want a particular party to come to our city is to not license them or, uh, they, any, any party has any right to ask for relief or any of the city's processes.

2278
03:13:27,601 --> 03:13:36,123
[SPEAKER_24]: That's, that's, um, pretty, pretty foundational, um, under the current way that the state and federal laws work for private property.

2279
03:13:36,323 --> 03:13:36,883
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand.

2280
03:13:37,043 --> 03:13:40,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you don't want to restrict in the prejudicial things and such, but,

2281
03:13:41,414 --> 03:13:48,237
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we should have some type of say into the reputation of a business that's coming into our community.

2282
03:13:48,497 --> 03:14:00,102
[SPEAKER_03]: But that being said, I'm assuming that when these construction starts, whether it's Salem Street or Mystic Ave, that we're going to put out a bid to different companies to bid on the projects.

2283
03:14:00,983 --> 03:14:10,249
[SPEAKER_24]: No, so that would be if the city owned land and was then trying to build a project in these areas, then we would have to go through this process, the bidding process procurement.

2284
03:14:11,210 --> 03:14:13,091
[SPEAKER_24]: Zoning affects private property owners.

2285
03:14:13,111 --> 03:14:20,437
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, it affects public property nominally, but most of the property in the city is owned by private entities, individuals, corporations, groups.

2286
03:14:21,578 --> 03:14:27,182
[SPEAKER_24]: So when we change the zoning, that changes the laws about what we allow private property owners to do.

2287
03:14:28,042 --> 03:14:43,934
[SPEAKER_24]: um private property owners can pick any construction company any lawyer or any designer any architect that they want to make a proposal make a design um and the city just has the process of outlined here like a site plan review process or special permitting process

2288
03:14:44,721 --> 03:15:04,330
[SPEAKER_24]: where the city has some limited, in some cases limited, in some cases significant discretionary choice as to what to allow, but we do not control who owns private property and we do not control who private property owners choose to hire to design projects, to construct projects, to make proposals to the city.

2289
03:15:04,911 --> 03:15:09,333
[SPEAKER_24]: So, and I don't think there's any law that would allow us to change that.

2290
03:15:09,753 --> 03:15:17,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's good to know, but hopefully it will be someone good and it will be historically appropriate for our city and not just another.

2291
03:15:17,696 --> 03:15:37,525
[SPEAKER_24]: I know that between the performance standards and the other things that are set in the zoning ordinance, the different boards, community development board especially, and other site plan review and special permit granting authorities will use the power allowed to us by the state zoning law to

2292
03:15:38,800 --> 03:15:39,721
[SPEAKER_24]: from these processes.

2293
03:15:39,761 --> 03:15:39,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.

2294
03:15:40,001 --> 03:15:40,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

2295
03:15:40,401 --> 03:15:41,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

2296
03:15:43,964 --> 03:15:45,005
[SPEAKER_24]: Name and address for the record, please.

2297
03:15:45,025 --> 03:15:45,706
[SPEAKER_24]: You have three minutes.

2298
03:15:46,446 --> 03:15:50,510
[SPEAKER_08]: William Navarre, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

2299
03:15:50,910 --> 03:15:58,776
[SPEAKER_08]: I mainly wanted to get up and say that I support this because it will allow the city to grow and welcome new people in the new housing.

2300
03:15:59,377 --> 03:16:04,341
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's a very important thing because Medford isn't full, and people need a place to live.

2301
03:16:04,541 --> 03:16:04,881
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2302
03:16:06,462 --> 03:16:06,903
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2303
03:16:07,143 --> 03:16:07,924
[SPEAKER_24]: Any further comment?

2304
03:16:09,204 --> 03:16:10,445
[SPEAKER_24]: Name and address for the record, please.

2305
03:16:10,465 --> 03:16:13,527
[SPEAKER_22]: You have three minutes.

2306
03:16:13,607 --> 03:16:19,091
[SPEAKER_22]: Just something that came up with this last ordinance, I guess, is zoning change.

2307
03:16:19,912 --> 03:16:20,312
[SPEAKER_22]: Drive-thrus.

2308
03:16:21,032 --> 03:16:24,755
[SPEAKER_22]: So I live on Riverside Ave, literally down the street from a new drive-thru that opened.

2309
03:16:24,795 --> 03:16:25,676
[SPEAKER_22]: Some of you may know it.

2310
03:16:25,976 --> 03:16:26,656
[SPEAKER_22]: Raising Canes.

2311
03:16:28,482 --> 03:16:29,022
[SPEAKER_22]: They haven't been yet?

2312
03:16:29,303 --> 03:16:29,583
[SPEAKER_22]: I haven't.

2313
03:16:29,843 --> 03:16:30,123
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know.

2314
03:16:30,143 --> 03:16:30,363
[SPEAKER_22]: I have.

2315
03:16:30,743 --> 03:16:31,084
[SPEAKER_22]: Is it good?

2316
03:16:31,344 --> 03:16:32,204
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm sure people assumed.

2317
03:16:32,465 --> 03:16:32,805
[SPEAKER_22]: Is it good?

2318
03:16:33,185 --> 03:16:33,585
[SPEAKER_24]: It's all right.

2319
03:16:33,926 --> 03:16:34,146
[SPEAKER_24]: OK.

2320
03:16:37,068 --> 03:16:37,788
[SPEAKER_24]: It's chicken, man.

2321
03:16:37,828 --> 03:16:38,769
[SPEAKER_24]: There's not so much you can do.

2322
03:16:38,789 --> 03:16:43,772
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, the sauce is pretty good.

2323
03:16:43,932 --> 03:16:45,593
[SPEAKER_22]: So they put it in my neighborhood, which is fine.

2324
03:16:45,633 --> 03:16:48,295
[SPEAKER_24]: It is Councilor Lazzaro's birthday, so let's give a little.

2325
03:16:50,036 --> 03:16:51,057
[SPEAKER_24]: And we have a big crowd, but.

2326
03:16:51,117 --> 03:16:52,197
[SPEAKER_22]: What, do you not like the sauce?

2327
03:16:53,558 --> 03:16:55,259
[SPEAKER_24]: I think she just doesn't want any more comments on the sauce.

2328
03:16:55,279 --> 03:16:56,120
[SPEAKER_22]: Chair, do you not like the sauce?

2329
03:16:58,248 --> 03:17:05,390
[SPEAKER_22]: So that said, it's in my neighborhood, and I don't think my neighborhood is necessarily any less safe or any more safe because of it.

2330
03:17:05,570 --> 03:17:10,031
[SPEAKER_22]: And my neighborhood has had a lot of development over the past few years since I've moved in here.

2331
03:17:10,731 --> 03:17:16,773
[SPEAKER_22]: So now you have a major corridor on Mystic Ave, and we say, you can't have a drive-through at all?

2332
03:17:17,693 --> 03:17:21,034
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, what if Chick-fil-A opened up, which, by the way, is a gold mine.

2333
03:17:21,134 --> 03:17:23,435
[SPEAKER_22]: And if you like King's Chicken, Chick-fil-A is awesome.

2334
03:17:24,882 --> 03:17:25,462
[SPEAKER_22]: just my opinion.

2335
03:17:26,022 --> 03:17:35,304
[SPEAKER_22]: And rightfully so, in Woburn, a lot of other people think so, and they get off the highway, and they go to Chick-fil-A, and they pick up their food, and they leave, and they're very prompt.

2336
03:17:36,285 --> 03:17:51,108
[SPEAKER_22]: And considering commercial business is part of the lifeblood of this city, I think that restricting, you know, because of this particular issue, right, with drive-thrus, might not be a wise choice given our fiscal situation.

2337
03:17:52,110 --> 03:17:58,091
[SPEAKER_22]: So maybe I don't know if that's something that can be amended or not to reconsider that particular part of this.

2338
03:17:59,112 --> 03:18:00,092
[SPEAKER_22]: You might wanna reconsider it.

2339
03:18:00,532 --> 03:18:00,832
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

2340
03:18:01,232 --> 03:18:01,712
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2341
03:18:03,473 --> 03:18:04,653
[SPEAKER_24]: Any further public comment?

2342
03:18:04,673 --> 03:18:05,733
[SPEAKER_24]: I see one hand on Zoom.

2343
03:18:05,773 --> 03:18:08,534
[SPEAKER_24]: I will go to, oh, that hand has gone down.

2344
03:18:09,314 --> 03:18:18,776
[SPEAKER_24]: So I will, if there's no further public comment in this public hearing, I will declare the public hearing closed.

2345
03:18:20,672 --> 03:18:35,516
[SPEAKER_24]: Any comments on the motion by Councilor Collins as amended by Councilor Callahan and seconded by Councilor Tseng to adopt the recommendations of the Community Development Board and to typos and strike line A8 of the use table Councilor Callahan

2346
03:18:38,615 --> 03:18:39,115
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you so much.

2347
03:18:39,215 --> 03:18:42,837
[SPEAKER_37]: I just wanted to say how much I appreciated the comment about our values.

2348
03:18:42,957 --> 03:18:45,819
[SPEAKER_37]: I think it's always really important to discuss our values.

2349
03:18:46,699 --> 03:18:51,562
[SPEAKER_37]: And I agree that in the comprehensive plan, it really is sort of filled with that kind of discussion.

2350
03:18:52,482 --> 03:18:57,865
[SPEAKER_37]: And you can read about what people in the community, what values other folks who live here wanted to bring.

2351
03:18:58,746 --> 03:19:07,290
[SPEAKER_37]: I know for myself, one of my highest values is a sense of community and vibrancy and people being able to walk to a place that they

2352
03:19:08,271 --> 03:19:09,552
[SPEAKER_37]: meet with their neighbors and really love.

2353
03:19:10,573 --> 03:19:12,254
[SPEAKER_37]: So that's something I'm always thinking about.

2354
03:19:12,354 --> 03:19:19,280
[SPEAKER_37]: I know for Mystic Ave, it really is not a place that people just love to walk down.

2355
03:19:19,920 --> 03:19:29,368
[SPEAKER_37]: So it's something that we've really been trying to work on is to make Mystic Ave something that serves us as a community and as residents.

2356
03:19:30,409 --> 03:19:35,693
[SPEAKER_37]: But another underlying thing that we understand that people want is there to be

2357
03:19:37,034 --> 03:20:00,436
[SPEAKER_37]: more new growth right so that new growth is both going to be commercial businesses moving in it's also going to be about new housing that brings in new revenue to the city they both bring in revenue to the city so I think those are among the many different things as well as well as you know we have these new green score that is going to bring more places which I think were mentioned about like

2358
03:20:00,836 --> 03:20:07,940
[SPEAKER_37]: where young and old people can, you know, spend time together where there's trees, where there's benches to sit on and places to, you know, to chat.

2359
03:20:08,741 --> 03:20:11,142
[SPEAKER_37]: We're going to be incentivizing that from developers.

2360
03:20:11,182 --> 03:20:15,465
[SPEAKER_37]: So these are all things that I think we have, we have brought forward as, as values.

2361
03:20:16,566 --> 03:20:24,631
[SPEAKER_37]: Each of us individually has values, but we also have some values that came out of the comprehensive plan that we are trying to make happen through the zoning process.

2362
03:20:24,671 --> 03:20:26,132
[SPEAKER_37]: So thank you so much for asking about that.

2363
03:20:27,052 --> 03:20:27,452
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2364
03:20:27,512 --> 03:20:28,193
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Collins.

2365
03:20:30,421 --> 03:20:31,062
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you so much.

2366
03:20:33,103 --> 03:20:33,704
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll keep it brief.

2367
03:20:33,904 --> 03:20:35,205
[SPEAKER_18]: I have a lot to say about this proposal.

2368
03:20:35,225 --> 03:20:57,003
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm really proud of it, really grateful to all of the staff, the Planning, Development and Sustainability Office that worked on it with us and the zoning consultant and continues to work on it with us and really laid the groundwork for this and other zoning proposals with work in the community over the course of years to really gather the information and the desires from the community that inform

2369
03:20:57,543 --> 03:21:17,177
[SPEAKER_18]: what we're doing here, what we know that people want to see around Medford, and how to articulate that in the, yes, rather sterile, but incredibly impactful language of zoning, which when you look at the proposals, looks, you know, if you were like me, not a zoning lawyer, it looks like nothing at first.

2370
03:21:18,858 --> 03:21:34,735
[SPEAKER_18]: But if you're one of those people who wants to know more and wants to know how our community values, or just you know what you want to see in your community is showing up in the zoning proposals I really do implore you to join us at our planning and permitting committee meetings where this work will be will continue throughout the rest of the fiscal year and possibly beyond that.

2371
03:21:35,415 --> 03:21:36,497
[SPEAKER_18]: We usually meet twice a month.

2372
03:21:37,577 --> 03:21:38,298
[SPEAKER_18]: Please do join us.

2373
03:21:39,359 --> 03:21:41,620
[SPEAKER_18]: I also, and I'm sorry, but just a really minor point.

2374
03:21:41,920 --> 03:21:45,643
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not the case that you can never ever have a drive-through on Mystic Ave.

2375
03:21:46,043 --> 03:21:49,425
[SPEAKER_18]: In the commercial district, you could apply for a special permit through the CDB.

2376
03:21:49,505 --> 03:21:55,329
[SPEAKER_18]: So just a, I believe a very minor fact check to round out this agenda item.

2377
03:21:56,629 --> 03:21:57,570
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for indulging me.

2378
03:21:57,610 --> 03:21:58,771
[SPEAKER_18]: And with that, I would move the question.

2379
03:21:59,511 --> 03:22:00,192
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, yes.

2380
03:22:00,232 --> 03:22:03,374
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think, you know, appreciate that correction that,

2381
03:22:04,090 --> 03:22:23,809
[SPEAKER_24]: There is one of the districts within this corridor, a sub-district that does allow special permit for the drive-thru, that's the commercial district, that is south of Mystic Valley Parkway-Harvard Street intersection and bordering the highway, which tends to be the area with the least possibility of becoming a more walkable area in this district.

2382
03:22:23,849 --> 03:22:28,813
[SPEAKER_24]: The rest of the district is really primed for becoming a much safer and much less of a,

2383
03:22:29,754 --> 03:22:52,553
[SPEAKER_24]: um strode as people call them which is a very very wide street that people drive down very very fast and is very very dangerous for anyone who's not in a car and quite frankly is dangerous for people who are in cars um so that is uh some of the values that we put in here um i just want to uh note that this is a long meeting um appreciate folks who've stuck around sometimes these kind of major changes get lost

2384
03:22:52,893 --> 03:22:54,394
[SPEAKER_24]: in the sauce of meetings like this.

2385
03:22:54,454 --> 03:22:56,095
[SPEAKER_24]: That's happened really a lot this year.

2386
03:22:56,755 --> 03:23:20,770
[SPEAKER_24]: We've made a ton of progress this year, and this is a really important ordinance that I think, for me, advances values of safe, well-maintained, and climate-resilient streets and open spaces, housing affordability and stability, and a number of other values that I hold and that I know were part of the reason that I ran for office and continue to run.

2387
03:23:23,812 --> 03:23:24,532
[SPEAKER_24]: It's a big moment.

2388
03:23:25,113 --> 03:23:39,364
[SPEAKER_24]: We have a motion to adopt this proposed amendment to the Medford Zoning Ordinance as amended by adopting the recommendations for amendment by the Community Development Board and the further amendments by Vice President Collins and Councilor Callahan.

2389
03:23:40,645 --> 03:23:42,546
[SPEAKER_24]: And that is as seconded by Councilor Tseng.

2390
03:23:42,666 --> 03:23:49,411
[SPEAKER_24]: So on this resolution, the first of many to come in this zoning updates project, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2391
03:23:50,832 --> 03:23:51,433
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Callahan.

2392
03:23:52,659 --> 03:23:53,540
[SPEAKER_36]: Vice President Collins.

2393
03:23:54,660 --> 03:23:55,521
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Lazzaro.

2394
03:23:56,441 --> 03:23:57,022
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Leming.

2395
03:23:57,542 --> 03:23:57,862
[SPEAKER_35]: Yes.

2396
03:23:59,143 --> 03:23:59,863
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Scarpelli.

2397
03:23:59,883 --> 03:23:59,943
[SPEAKER_36]: No.

2398
03:24:01,824 --> 03:24:02,365
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Tseng.

2399
03:24:02,385 --> 03:24:02,445
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes.

2400
03:24:03,505 --> 03:24:04,086
[SPEAKER_36]: President Bears.

2401
03:24:04,346 --> 03:24:05,226
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, it's the affirmative.

2402
03:24:05,266 --> 03:24:06,567
[SPEAKER_24]: One of the negative, the motion passes.

2403
03:24:07,367 --> 03:24:16,193
[SPEAKER_24]: At this point, I would like to, quite frankly, given the late hour, I'd like to run a quick unofficial poll on the remaining items.

2404
03:24:16,373 --> 03:24:20,095
[SPEAKER_24]: How many people are here for the special permit for signs at the Meadow Glen?

2405
03:24:23,649 --> 03:24:24,029
[SPEAKER_24]: He's gone.

2406
03:24:24,370 --> 03:24:25,430
[SPEAKER_24]: So, all right.

2407
03:24:26,071 --> 03:24:27,892
[SPEAKER_24]: Is there a motion to table that to the next regular meeting?

2408
03:24:27,912 --> 03:24:30,654
[SPEAKER_30]: Is that a special permit?

2409
03:24:31,054 --> 03:24:31,675
[SPEAKER_24]: It's a continuance?

2410
03:24:41,806 --> 03:24:42,887
[SPEAKER_24]: All right, we'll do that.

2411
03:24:43,427 --> 03:24:44,648
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll do that and then I'll take my poll.

2412
03:24:45,769 --> 03:24:50,572
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion to continue the amendment to the special permit for signs, paper 24514 to the next regular meeting.

2413
03:24:51,332 --> 03:24:52,293
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2414
03:24:55,415 --> 03:24:55,655
[SPEAKER_24]: Sure.

2415
03:24:59,918 --> 03:25:01,219
[SPEAKER_24]: It's Scarpelli Callahan.

2416
03:25:06,482 --> 03:25:07,083
[SPEAKER_24]: You want my job?

2417
03:25:07,963 --> 03:25:08,884
[SPEAKER_24]: You might both need to do it.

2418
03:25:18,151 --> 03:25:23,292
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Callahan, Vice President Collins, Councilor Lazzaro, Councilor Leming.

2419
03:25:23,752 --> 03:25:24,052
[SPEAKER_35]: Yes.

2420
03:25:25,092 --> 03:25:25,772
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Scarpelli.

2421
03:25:26,232 --> 03:25:26,393
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes.

2422
03:25:26,833 --> 03:25:27,313
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Tseng.

2423
03:25:27,333 --> 03:25:27,393
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes.

2424
03:25:27,813 --> 03:25:28,413
[SPEAKER_36]: President Bears.

2425
03:25:28,953 --> 03:25:29,193
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

2426
03:25:29,273 --> 03:25:30,853
[SPEAKER_24]: I've been affirming the negative motion passes.

2427
03:25:30,873 --> 03:25:32,194
[SPEAKER_24]: Let's continue to the next regular meeting.

2428
03:25:32,214 --> 03:25:34,574
[SPEAKER_24]: 24, 516, Barry's back.

2429
03:25:34,614 --> 03:25:35,374
[SPEAKER_24]: Let's take this quick.

2430
03:25:35,414 --> 03:25:36,374
[SPEAKER_24]: I think everything's in order.

2431
03:25:36,894 --> 03:25:39,475
[SPEAKER_24]: This is common victors license for Mrs. Murphy's.

2432
03:25:39,535 --> 03:25:41,455
[SPEAKER_24]: Barry, if you want to talk about the business for a second.

2433
03:25:44,836 --> 03:25:45,016
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

2434
03:25:46,949 --> 03:25:50,751
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, I've got very little to say other than we're very excited to get it opened.

2435
03:25:50,931 --> 03:25:59,035
[SPEAKER_26]: I think the community have been asking us for a long time when that opening date will be, and we're hoping sometime around mid-January.

2436
03:25:59,315 --> 03:26:01,216
[SPEAKER_24]: And this is a pub in Medford Square.

2437
03:26:01,816 --> 03:26:02,196
[SPEAKER_24]: Correct.

2438
03:26:02,796 --> 03:26:04,777
[SPEAKER_24]: A pub in Medford Square.

2439
03:26:04,817 --> 03:26:06,098
[SPEAKER_24]: They said it could never happen.

2440
03:26:08,619 --> 03:26:09,560
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2441
03:26:09,780 --> 03:26:10,100
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

2442
03:26:10,220 --> 03:26:10,560
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

2443
03:26:11,000 --> 03:26:11,481
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

2444
03:26:13,381 --> 03:26:16,163
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Scarpelli, recognize you on the speaker.

2445
03:26:16,183 --> 03:26:16,503
[SPEAKER_24]: Go ahead.

2446
03:26:19,118 --> 03:26:19,798
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, here you go.

2447
03:26:19,858 --> 03:26:20,238
[SPEAKER_24]: I gotcha.

2448
03:26:20,258 --> 03:26:20,999
[SPEAKER_24]: There you go.

2449
03:26:21,039 --> 03:26:28,243
[SPEAKER_29]: You're gonna be sick of hearing me tonight, but we see everything in its order, Mr. Rafferty, and I really drove by today.

2450
03:26:28,483 --> 03:26:30,004
[SPEAKER_29]: The front door looks amazing.

2451
03:26:30,184 --> 03:26:31,045
[SPEAKER_29]: It's really inviting.

2452
03:26:31,565 --> 03:26:34,867
[SPEAKER_29]: And I'm so happy that you're gonna have Saria A games there.

2453
03:26:35,087 --> 03:26:36,548
[SPEAKER_29]: It's so funny that- Yes, sir.

2454
03:26:36,608 --> 03:26:37,329
[SPEAKER_29]: I appreciate that.

2455
03:26:37,529 --> 03:26:38,089
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes, sir.

2456
03:26:38,409 --> 03:26:42,892
[SPEAKER_29]: But I see everything, so I move approval as long as my fellow colleagues have no other questions.

2457
03:26:42,912 --> 03:26:45,614
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, do you have a comment?

2458
03:26:46,725 --> 03:26:49,088
[SPEAKER_24]: seconded by or comment by, is there a second?

2459
03:26:49,448 --> 03:26:49,889
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll second it.

2460
03:26:50,189 --> 03:26:51,811
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Collins, comment by Councilor Collins.

2461
03:26:54,293 --> 03:26:55,835
[SPEAKER_18]: Really excited to see the sign go up.

2462
03:26:55,875 --> 03:26:57,116
[SPEAKER_18]: Can't wait to visit in January.

2463
03:26:57,136 --> 03:27:00,961
[SPEAKER_18]: And just to confirm, you will be keeping like extra late hours on Tuesday nights, right?

2464
03:27:02,482 --> 03:27:03,924
[SPEAKER_26]: Apparently so.

2465
03:27:03,944 --> 03:27:04,905
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

2466
03:27:06,062 --> 03:27:09,327
[SPEAKER_26]: You can come back for that for not to.

2467
03:27:09,888 --> 03:27:14,655
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, we're working on that to wait a few months.

2468
03:27:14,915 --> 03:27:17,879
[SPEAKER_24]: And I do want to recognize the clerk who rarely speaks but would like to speak tonight.

2469
03:27:18,440 --> 03:27:20,904
[SPEAKER_36]: I Barry I just want to reiterate.

2470
03:27:22,531 --> 03:27:25,692
[SPEAKER_36]: What a privilege and a pleasure it's been on behalf of the clerk's office to work with you.

2471
03:27:25,712 --> 03:27:31,075
[SPEAKER_36]: You're always just so, so much fun and so professional and so kind when you come into our office.

2472
03:27:31,236 --> 03:27:35,438
[SPEAKER_36]: And everybody in our office really appreciates it when you come in there.

2473
03:27:35,478 --> 03:27:43,042
[SPEAKER_36]: And I don't normally speak on these kinds of things, but your kindnesses to the team in my office have been noticed.

2474
03:27:43,122 --> 03:27:48,125
[SPEAKER_36]: And I just wanted you to know, and I wanted to say publicly what a pleasure it's been to work with you on this.

2475
03:27:49,426 --> 03:27:49,806
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2476
03:27:49,847 --> 03:28:01,378
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, and I just want to echo that there are a lot of people in this building who have difficult jobs dealing with folks who want things to happen faster and when you hear from the clerk and representing his clerks about someone who

2477
03:28:02,438 --> 03:28:08,002
[SPEAKER_24]: was calm and patient with the government process over many months, including tonight.

2478
03:28:09,823 --> 03:28:10,904
[SPEAKER_24]: It doesn't go unnoticed.

2479
03:28:10,944 --> 03:28:12,265
[SPEAKER_36]: I mean, I asked him a couple of questions.

2480
03:28:12,285 --> 03:28:14,186
[SPEAKER_36]: He just said, come on across the street with me.

2481
03:28:14,206 --> 03:28:15,947
[SPEAKER_36]: We walked over and he showed me what was going on.

2482
03:28:16,888 --> 03:28:23,933
[SPEAKER_36]: The level of involvement was outstanding, but it wasn't just the professionalism.

2483
03:28:23,973 --> 03:28:26,415
[SPEAKER_36]: I don't think I've ever spoken on a Common Vic license before.

2484
03:28:26,815 --> 03:28:32,537
[SPEAKER_36]: But the level of kindness and professionalism, you just got it.

2485
03:28:32,597 --> 03:28:34,437
[SPEAKER_36]: And it was such a privilege to work with you.

2486
03:28:34,457 --> 03:28:35,117
[SPEAKER_36]: I just want to say that.

2487
03:28:35,998 --> 03:28:36,298
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2488
03:28:36,318 --> 03:28:37,138
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm grateful.

2489
03:28:37,158 --> 03:28:37,438
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2490
03:28:37,678 --> 03:28:41,299
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Vice President Collins, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2491
03:28:44,400 --> 03:28:44,860

2492
03:28:44,880 --> 03:28:45,020
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes.

2493
03:28:46,201 --> 03:28:47,001
[SPEAKER_36]: Vice President Collins?

2494
03:28:47,021 --> 03:28:47,081
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes.

2495
03:28:47,521 --> 03:28:48,221
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Lazzaro?

2496
03:28:48,261 --> 03:28:48,341
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes.

2497
03:28:48,701 --> 03:28:49,341
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Leming?

2498
03:28:49,621 --> 03:28:49,902
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

2499
03:28:50,702 --> 03:28:51,462
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Scarpelli?

2500
03:28:51,702 --> 03:28:51,862
Yes.

2501
03:28:53,042 --> 03:28:53,563
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Tseng?

2502
03:28:54,083 --> 03:28:54,243
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes.

2503
03:28:55,171 --> 03:28:57,233
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, 70 affirmative, none negative, the motion passes.

2504
03:28:57,373 --> 03:28:57,793
[SPEAKER_24]: Good luck.

2505
03:28:58,193 --> 03:28:58,514
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2506
03:28:59,354 --> 03:29:00,255
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you, folks.

2507
03:29:00,716 --> 03:29:01,396
[SPEAKER_24]: He thought about it.

2508
03:29:01,917 --> 03:29:03,037
[SPEAKER_24]: He thought about saying more.

2509
03:29:04,098 --> 03:29:05,660
[SPEAKER_24]: Vice President Collins, you're recognized.

2510
03:29:07,721 --> 03:29:08,602
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, you're recognized.

2511
03:29:10,984 --> 03:29:14,287
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I was gonna make a motion that might supersede the poll that you're about to take.

2512
03:29:14,307 --> 03:29:16,488
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, there's three items left.

2513
03:29:17,289 --> 03:29:23,674
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm guessing on the poll of the three items left, how many people are here for the Safe Communities Ordinance and the Community Control Republic Surveillance Ordinance?

2514
03:29:23,694 --> 03:29:24,415
[SPEAKER_24]: If you could raise your hands.

2515
03:29:25,475 --> 03:29:26,676
[SPEAKER_24]: How many folks are here on Tufts?

2516
03:29:27,657 --> 03:29:29,978
[SPEAKER_24]: And how many folks are here on Salem Street Corridor referral?

2517
03:29:30,919 --> 03:29:32,280
[SPEAKER_24]: All right, got it.

2518
03:29:32,360 --> 03:29:36,783
[SPEAKER_24]: So, and that, if you could just move to take the, let's just get the folks out of here.

2519
03:29:37,063 --> 03:29:40,866
[SPEAKER_18]: Great, I'll move to suspend the rules to take 23055 and 24502.

2520
03:29:41,106 --> 03:29:44,769
[SPEAKER_18]: On the motion to suspend to take 23055 and 24502 by Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

2521
03:29:44,789 --> 03:29:45,669
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2522
03:30:09,889 --> 03:30:14,692
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Kelly, Vice President Collins, Councilor Lazzaro, Councilor Leming.

2523
03:30:15,092 --> 03:30:15,372
[SPEAKER_35]: Yes.

2524
03:30:15,392 --> 03:30:19,495
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Kelly, Councilor Tseng, President Bears.

2525
03:30:19,855 --> 03:30:22,016
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, Assembly Member Nunn and negative motion passes 23-055.

2526
03:30:22,317 --> 03:30:27,640
[SPEAKER_24]: This is the welcoming city ordinance.

2527
03:30:27,760 --> 03:30:31,843
[SPEAKER_24]: Is there a motion to waive the reading in favor of a brief summary from the proponent?

2528
03:30:32,583 --> 03:30:35,565
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion of Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

2529
03:30:35,605 --> 03:30:37,406
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Clerk, once again, please call the roll.

2530
03:30:49,704 --> 03:30:54,327
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Callahan, Vice President Collins, Councilor Lazzaro, Councilor Fleming.

2531
03:30:55,948 --> 03:30:56,188
[SPEAKER_35]: Yes.

2532
03:30:57,429 --> 03:31:00,390
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Kelly, Councilor Tseng, President Paris.

2533
03:31:00,791 --> 03:31:02,912
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, I have the affirmative and the negative, the motion passes.

2534
03:31:04,493 --> 03:31:10,877
[SPEAKER_24]: All right, so Councilor Tseng, if you want to give a summary and then we can move into Councilor discussion and then public participation.

2535
03:31:11,357 --> 03:31:12,618
[SPEAKER_24]: Great.

2536
03:31:13,038 --> 03:31:14,499
[SPEAKER_19]: If you, there we go.

2537
03:31:15,738 --> 03:31:25,217
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll give a very brief summary and then Councilor Leming has some amendments that we got sent earlier before this meeting, technical amendments.

2538
03:31:26,724 --> 03:31:42,913
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, first, I really just need to thank Councilor Leming and the resident advocates for our immigrant community here in Medford for all the hard work and persistence in trying to get this passed.

2539
03:31:44,033 --> 03:31:55,940
[SPEAKER_19]: When I introduced this years ago, I introduced this because I had talked to a lot of friends and a lot of residents who feared for their safety and feared interacting with City Hall.

2540
03:31:56,942 --> 03:31:59,649
[SPEAKER_19]: with our city government and with our institutions.

2541
03:32:00,511 --> 03:32:04,983
[SPEAKER_19]: And they didn't know that we have an existing non-cooperative

2542
03:32:05,683 --> 03:32:11,947
[SPEAKER_19]: a non-cooperation agreement policy with ICE when it comes to non-criminal matters.

2543
03:32:12,827 --> 03:32:26,356
[SPEAKER_19]: And, you know, that's really technical language, but so many cities put it out there and codify it and make it clear where they stand when it comes to the fundamental truths and values of dignity, of community, and of compassion.

2544
03:32:28,254 --> 03:32:36,896
[SPEAKER_19]: I believe then and I believe now that it's important for Medford to state where we lie, where we stand on these values, on these fundamental truths.

2545
03:32:38,636 --> 03:32:48,018
[SPEAKER_19]: The next four years are going to be very trying for a lot of people who are so foundational to our community, to our neighbors, to our friends, to our family.

2546
03:32:48,839 --> 03:32:54,520
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's important, in my opinion, to codify the policies and to give them that security that

2547
03:32:55,598 --> 03:33:05,555
[SPEAKER_19]: We already one already have in place but to expand that secure that sense of safety and security for them and give residents a chance to feel safe in their own homes.

2548
03:33:07,558 --> 03:33:08,079
[SPEAKER_19]: Being brief.

2549
03:33:10,077 --> 03:33:15,222
[SPEAKER_19]: about the content of this resolution is really not that much different from what our city already has in place.

2550
03:33:16,222 --> 03:33:17,724
[SPEAKER_19]: Our city administration has reviewed it.

2551
03:33:18,805 --> 03:33:19,986
[SPEAKER_19]: We've met about it in committee.

2552
03:33:20,006 --> 03:33:36,520
[SPEAKER_19]: This is essentially just codifying and making sure that in the future, this policy can't just be overturned, that residents can know that there is a formality, there is longevity to this policy, and that will be put on the books.

2553
03:33:37,120 --> 03:33:44,327
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'll stop there and let Councilor Leming provide the amendments.

2554
03:33:44,607 --> 03:33:45,608
[SPEAKER_19]: Going to Councilor Leming.

2555
03:33:47,950 --> 03:33:48,250
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

2556
03:33:48,270 --> 03:33:54,636
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm just going to share my screen really quickly to this Google document that I have.

2557
03:33:54,656 --> 03:33:56,297
[SPEAKER_33]: All right.

2558
03:33:56,497 --> 03:33:57,258
[SPEAKER_33]: Can everybody see that?

2559
03:34:00,841 --> 03:34:01,442
[SPEAKER_33]: Hello?

2560
03:34:02,042 --> 03:34:03,123
[SPEAKER_24]: It is visible on the screen.

2561
03:34:03,143 --> 03:34:04,064
[SPEAKER_33]: All right, great.

2562
03:34:04,837 --> 03:34:13,720
[SPEAKER_33]: So we went over the text of this in the most recent meeting of the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee meeting.

2563
03:34:14,521 --> 03:34:28,286
[SPEAKER_33]: Following that meeting, I had some lengthy discussions and feedback from the City's legal teams, as well as some lawyers that work with the ACLU who are involved with Medford People Power.

2564
03:34:30,325 --> 03:34:37,409
[SPEAKER_33]: And I was kind of doing a little bit of back and forth to figure out what sort of language both parties could agree upon.

2565
03:34:38,330 --> 03:34:55,459
[SPEAKER_33]: Before I get into it, I'll also quickly add that this version that I'm working with contains a slight change from what was forwarded to my colleagues earlier today, because just before the meeting, I believe it was Councilor Callaghan who noticed some misspellings under whistleblower protection.

2566
03:34:57,040 --> 03:34:59,402
[SPEAKER_33]: I ended up amending that in this current draft.

2567
03:34:59,762 --> 03:35:05,187
[SPEAKER_33]: But essentially, the reviews by the city's legal team

2568
03:35:08,923 --> 03:35:22,150
[SPEAKER_33]: clarified the relationship throughout a lot of this ordinance with respect to the city's working relationship with federal agents and federal law and sort of how that works out in practice.

2569
03:35:22,170 --> 03:35:25,011
[SPEAKER_33]: So there's a couple of points here.

2570
03:35:25,231 --> 03:35:27,773
[SPEAKER_33]: For instance, the use of local resources.

2571
03:35:27,813 --> 03:35:30,794
[SPEAKER_33]: What you can see here is in green, these are the edits that were provided.

2572
03:35:31,975 --> 03:35:34,396
[SPEAKER_33]: And these are sort of edits that

2573
03:35:35,542 --> 03:35:55,100
[SPEAKER_33]: This kind of covers situations where if someone is detained and they end up getting fingerprinted as a result of a criminal proceeding, then that biometric data would end up going into a sort of a centralized government database, which is just how criminal

2574
03:36:02,808 --> 03:36:05,650
[SPEAKER_33]: enforcement works, both on the federal and local level.

2575
03:36:06,391 --> 03:36:13,677
[SPEAKER_33]: But that doesn't really say, but that's kind of like separate from its potential relationship with ICE.

2576
03:36:14,898 --> 03:36:19,742
[SPEAKER_33]: And there's just a few, there's a few other things here that

2577
03:36:20,729 --> 03:36:23,852
[SPEAKER_33]: kind of that site-specific federal laws.

2578
03:36:24,352 --> 03:36:48,753
[SPEAKER_33]: One thing that came up that the ACLU lawyers pointed out was this phrase right here, an officer employee of Medford Police Department may participate or assist with an operation led by a federal immigration agency to detain persons for civil immigration enforcement purposes unless it is in direct response to a request for immediate response on a temporary basis for officer safety purposes.

2579
03:36:49,313 --> 03:36:56,538
[SPEAKER_33]: or assistance in the apprehension of an individual for whom there is an active arrest warrant issued by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

2580
03:36:57,038 --> 03:37:06,023
[SPEAKER_33]: This officer safety phrase in quotes is actually fairly common to include in these sorts of ordinances.

2581
03:37:06,083 --> 03:37:14,168
[SPEAKER_33]: And there is a history of court decisions about the use of officer safety and asking for assistance.

2582
03:37:14,188 --> 03:37:18,191
[SPEAKER_33]: So I'm comfortable including that in there.

2583
03:37:19,780 --> 03:37:24,462
[SPEAKER_33]: Otherwise the most the biggest changes that Yes.

2584
03:37:25,542 --> 03:37:40,148
[SPEAKER_24]: If I could just is it fair to say that these amendments reflect the view of legal counsel to ensure that this policy aligns with federal law while maintaining the intent and integrity of the Of the ordinance proposed and the

2585
03:37:41,380 --> 03:37:45,541
[SPEAKER_24]: policy that has been in place through the Medford Police Department for the last eight years?

2586
03:37:46,281 --> 03:37:47,282
[SPEAKER_33]: Yes, yes, it does.

2587
03:37:47,922 --> 03:37:51,103
[SPEAKER_33]: The main, so I'll get to that.

2588
03:37:51,123 --> 03:38:09,128
[SPEAKER_33]: So the main points that the city brought up was the complaints enforcement, et cetera, bits that were added in there at a point in the editing process where

2589
03:38:10,260 --> 03:38:21,727
[SPEAKER_33]: We originally had this complaints, this complaints procedure, but that actually that actually was redundant to the internal policies of the Medford Police Department.

2590
03:38:21,807 --> 03:38:32,073
[SPEAKER_33]: So we ended up deleting that and this other cause of action that there that ended up that turns out that that just replicates things that are already in involved in state and federal law.

2591
03:38:33,534 --> 03:38:36,776
[SPEAKER_33]: But otherwise, yeah, this replicates state and federal laws.

2592
03:38:36,816 --> 03:38:38,998
[SPEAKER_33]: But otherwise, these changes

2593
03:38:40,291 --> 03:38:49,694
[SPEAKER_33]: basically just make this ordinance consistent with, um, just clarifies the relationship of the ordinance with federal law.

2594
03:38:50,574 --> 03:38:53,495
[SPEAKER_33]: I'd be pleased to answer any specific questions from my colleagues about it.

2595
03:38:54,515 --> 03:38:55,196
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Councilor Lemmie.

2596
03:38:55,256 --> 03:39:03,338
[SPEAKER_24]: If you could, um, save a copy of this with no track changes and submit a clean version to the clerk for inclusion in the council records, that would be much appreciated.

2597
03:39:04,078 --> 03:39:04,378
[SPEAKER_32]: Will do.

2598
03:39:04,438 --> 03:39:06,399
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

2599
03:39:06,499 --> 03:39:09,920
[SPEAKER_24]: And also we need it for the advertisement for second reading.

2600
03:39:11,921 --> 03:39:15,445
[SPEAKER_24]: With that, I will go to Councilor Lazzaro, then Councilor Scarpelli.

2601
03:39:16,746 --> 03:39:17,046
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

2602
03:39:17,106 --> 03:39:22,791
[SPEAKER_40]: I just wanted to clarify one thing that this is something that is already in practice for the Medford Police Department.

2603
03:39:23,432 --> 03:39:33,361
[SPEAKER_40]: We discussed this in our committee meeting at length, but I did want to say for folks gathered here today that may not have been at the committee meeting that

2604
03:39:34,989 --> 03:39:44,768
[SPEAKER_40]: When we put something like this in an ordinance, it's much more difficult if something were to change down the road to, you know, change a policy.

2605
03:39:46,872 --> 03:39:50,654
[SPEAKER_40]: is something you can do kind of quickly to change an ordinance, it would be much more complicated.

2606
03:39:50,714 --> 03:40:11,486
[SPEAKER_40]: So we're enshrining something that is practiced now in our city ordinances so that it's something that we are affirming and saying that it is something that we believe in very firmly, that this is something that is part of our local laws and it will be hard to

2607
03:40:12,486 --> 03:40:12,926
[SPEAKER_40]: turn around.

2608
03:40:14,328 --> 03:40:20,612
[SPEAKER_40]: It's something that I think is very important, and I think it's important that we're doing it tonight, and I appreciate all the work that's gone into it thus far.

2609
03:40:20,773 --> 03:40:21,073
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

2610
03:40:22,414 --> 03:40:22,734
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2611
03:40:22,774 --> 03:40:24,696
[SPEAKER_24]: I'll go to Councilor Scarpelli, then Vice President Collins.

2612
03:40:24,756 --> 03:40:25,776
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Scarpelli.

2613
03:40:25,876 --> 03:40:26,957
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2614
03:40:26,977 --> 03:40:29,179
[SPEAKER_29]: First, I want to thank Barry and Marie.

2615
03:40:32,506 --> 03:40:36,128
[SPEAKER_29]: having a conversation and really having an open dialogue.

2616
03:40:36,168 --> 03:40:43,333
[SPEAKER_29]: I think that we expressed a lot of information about this ordinance and having my support.

2617
03:40:43,353 --> 03:40:47,796
[SPEAKER_29]: And I think that my biggest concern are two basic issues.

2618
03:40:47,896 --> 03:40:49,897
[SPEAKER_29]: And one thing I'll ask is,

2619
03:40:50,397 --> 03:41:08,463
[SPEAKER_29]: as I get started is I'd like to see this to be tabled so we can sit with the chief because I don't think that we've had a conversation with the chief and understand the impacts with the police department when we make an ordinance and how it could conflict with the city ordinance and what his job requires him to do.

2620
03:41:09,083 --> 03:41:27,609
[SPEAKER_29]: So I think that he, you know, I think that that's, you know, the understanding that the ACLU, the support and the involvement of the ACLU has left some residents questioning, you know, their beliefs in what policing is and what this means with this ordinance.

2621
03:41:27,629 --> 03:41:28,250
[SPEAKER_29]: So I think that

2622
03:41:30,495 --> 03:41:35,499
[SPEAKER_29]: the understanding the slippery slopes when we talk about, we talk about this, this ordinance.

2623
03:41:36,299 --> 03:41:52,111
[SPEAKER_29]: And when I've talked to the chief and I've talked to city officials, when chief Sacco put together the federal immigration enforcement plan and really put this in place, you know, they shared that, you know, the number one priority is our community safety and comfort of this community.

2624
03:41:52,131 --> 03:41:55,454
[SPEAKER_29]: And I think it's important because I think this is very important.

2625
03:41:55,554 --> 03:41:58,176
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't think I can sit here

2626
03:42:00,006 --> 03:42:12,129
[SPEAKER_29]: and attest that as a city councilor, I've sat in a house, I've stood in a house with six ICE agents and a family of undocumented members of a community and, um,

2627
03:42:12,600 --> 03:42:13,261
[SPEAKER_29]: I know the fear.

2628
03:42:13,301 --> 03:42:13,941
[SPEAKER_29]: I understand it.

2629
03:42:14,102 --> 03:42:25,172
[SPEAKER_29]: But I also think that when we move something toward an ordinance, I think we need to do our due diligence and make sure that we really have the information and we're all coming into this as a plan.

2630
03:42:25,352 --> 03:42:28,976
[SPEAKER_29]: And I talked to the chief and the chief has been part of this.

2631
03:42:30,277 --> 03:42:31,558
[SPEAKER_29]: This is a very important piece.

2632
03:42:31,658 --> 03:42:39,282
[SPEAKER_29]: I think that having the chief of police sit down with our body and say, what are some limitations?

2633
03:42:39,322 --> 03:42:40,302
[SPEAKER_29]: What are some concerns?

2634
03:42:40,662 --> 03:42:41,703
[SPEAKER_29]: How do we fix that?

2635
03:42:41,763 --> 03:42:43,143
[SPEAKER_29]: How do we express it?

2636
03:42:43,284 --> 03:42:45,064
[SPEAKER_29]: How do we bring it forward so we can move forward?

2637
03:42:46,145 --> 03:42:47,045
[SPEAKER_29]: That hasn't been done yet.

2638
03:42:47,185 --> 03:42:48,866
[SPEAKER_29]: So I think that's important.

2639
03:42:48,886 --> 03:42:50,087
[SPEAKER_29]: I think before we move forward, I think

2640
03:42:50,607 --> 03:43:00,571
[SPEAKER_29]: that table moving into a meeting to sit with the chief and understand that this is a process so we can all understand what the ramification is as a law enforcement officer.

2641
03:43:00,591 --> 03:43:01,671
[SPEAKER_29]: Because we don't.

2642
03:43:01,711 --> 03:43:06,633
[SPEAKER_29]: We're doing something that means well, and we want to do something to protect people, which is good.

2643
03:43:07,213 --> 03:43:08,693
[SPEAKER_29]: But I think we're talking about an ordinance.

2644
03:43:08,733 --> 03:43:10,014
[SPEAKER_29]: I think we need all the information.

2645
03:43:10,034 --> 03:43:10,854
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't think we have done that.

2646
03:43:10,914 --> 03:43:18,637
[SPEAKER_29]: And the other piece, and I would also like to invite the administration, the financial director, for the other impact.

2647
03:43:20,729 --> 03:43:25,691
[SPEAKER_29]: it is gonna be a different time in a few weeks.

2648
03:43:26,271 --> 03:43:41,116
[SPEAKER_29]: And we've seen it openly discussed how communities that put ordinances or rules in place like this, that the national agenda is to harm us financially with federal funding.

2649
03:43:41,676 --> 03:43:44,217
[SPEAKER_29]: So I think we need to also understand that platform.

2650
03:43:44,978 --> 03:43:48,319
[SPEAKER_29]: So again, it's not something that,

2651
03:43:49,332 --> 03:43:54,197
[SPEAKER_29]: this council is not supporting for the good reasons, but I think it's important that we get all the information out there.

2652
03:43:54,217 --> 03:43:56,219
[SPEAKER_29]: I know it's goodwill.

2653
03:43:56,299 --> 03:43:56,960
[SPEAKER_29]: It feels good.

2654
03:43:57,020 --> 03:44:02,125
[SPEAKER_29]: People have done some great work and really put a lot of passion into this, and I commend them.

2655
03:44:02,665 --> 03:44:07,991
[SPEAKER_29]: But again, I can't support this unless we do our due diligence and sit down with the

2656
03:44:08,703 --> 03:44:12,447
[SPEAKER_29]: probably the most important person in this community, the person that actually does our policing.

2657
03:44:13,007 --> 03:44:14,990
[SPEAKER_29]: And he's always been involved.

2658
03:44:15,090 --> 03:44:25,921
[SPEAKER_29]: He's always been welcoming to come sit down with us and share his opinion and see what our police department and what those impacts means when you talk about

2659
03:44:26,596 --> 03:44:33,639
[SPEAKER_29]: changing an ordinance to what they do every day by law and how that might be intertwined in a negative fashion.

2660
03:44:33,679 --> 03:44:39,542
[SPEAKER_29]: So I think that's something that I'm going to stand with and I hope my colleagues can understand that.

2661
03:44:39,622 --> 03:44:40,502
[SPEAKER_29]: So thank you, Mr. President.

2662
03:44:43,723 --> 03:44:44,523
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Bears.

2663
03:44:45,203 --> 03:44:52,666
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to first start by thanking the community members that have been advocating this for a very long time, and then Councilors Tseng and Leming for leading on this.

2664
03:44:55,226 --> 03:45:09,951
[SPEAKER_18]: To me, what this ordinance project says is the city's existing policy of non-cooperation with federal ICE agents is so good and makes so much sense and is so common sense that we should enshrine that as a city ordinance.

2665
03:45:11,391 --> 03:45:13,512
[SPEAKER_18]: And I just agree with that wholeheartedly.

2666
03:45:13,672 --> 03:45:29,456
[SPEAKER_18]: To me, what this says is we want to protect Medford resources for the purpose of taking care of Medford residents, not for carrying out orders or agendas that were promulgated somewhere far away from here, not in our community.

2667
03:45:30,076 --> 03:45:43,379
[SPEAKER_18]: Our resources, our personnel, the expertise and the time of our public safety officials, people doing that work in our community, that should be for us, not for a national agenda.

2668
03:45:44,641 --> 03:45:46,943
[SPEAKER_18]: and not for the agenda of any other state or entity.

2669
03:45:47,924 --> 03:45:49,645
[SPEAKER_18]: So for that reason, I think it's really the right time.

2670
03:45:49,665 --> 03:45:53,688
[SPEAKER_18]: I think any time would be a good time to enshrine that existing policy as an ordinance.

2671
03:45:53,708 --> 03:45:56,069
[SPEAKER_18]: I think this is, I think the moment is now.

2672
03:45:56,850 --> 03:46:00,853
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm really proud of my fellow Councilors for putting this together and making sure that

2673
03:46:02,374 --> 03:46:09,319
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, this policy that the current administration and city staff and public safety officers have been doing just because it's the right thing to do.

2674
03:46:09,339 --> 03:46:16,424
[SPEAKER_18]: And it was obviously the right policy to have that we can make sure that that is protected for the future, come what may.

2675
03:46:16,905 --> 03:46:18,766
[SPEAKER_18]: With that, I'd motion to approve for our first reading.

2676
03:46:18,786 --> 03:46:24,891
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion of Councilor Collins to approve for first reading, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro, Councilor Sanz.

2677
03:46:25,728 --> 03:46:26,068
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

2678
03:46:26,549 --> 03:46:34,736
[SPEAKER_19]: I also, um, I believe that in working with Councilor Leming, he wanted to motion to waive the three readings as well.

2679
03:46:37,118 --> 03:46:47,046
[SPEAKER_19]: To respond to some of the points that have been brought up, both I and Councilor Leming have reached out to the police chief over the last few years about this.

2680
03:46:49,002 --> 03:46:56,388
[SPEAKER_19]: when we were meeting about it years ago, and in the lead up to the recent meetings about it, I was DCed on an email.

2681
03:46:56,408 --> 03:47:00,851
[SPEAKER_19]: I know Chair Leming reached out as chair of the committee this was in.

2682
03:47:02,472 --> 03:47:10,998
[SPEAKER_19]: We didn't receive, or I hadn't received in my inbox any notes to the contrary.

2683
03:47:13,300 --> 03:47:15,582
[SPEAKER_19]: That's why we felt comfortable moving forward with it.

2684
03:47:16,663 --> 03:47:31,396
[SPEAKER_19]: As the executive branch that's in charge of community safety, policing, and the like, we did make sure to cooperate with the executive branch on this since they will be carrying out this policy.

2685
03:47:32,277 --> 03:47:36,020
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's where Councilor Leming's proposed amendments come from tonight as well.

2686
03:47:39,958 --> 03:47:43,320
[SPEAKER_19]: I believe there's another point I might be slightly forgetting.

2687
03:47:43,400 --> 03:47:47,022
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, we did talk about the federal funding piece.

2688
03:47:48,523 --> 03:47:54,266
[SPEAKER_19]: Lots of that was overturned in federal litigation.

2689
03:47:55,387 --> 03:48:01,490
[SPEAKER_19]: Many components of the Trump, first Trump administration's course of policies against municipalities were overturned.

2690
03:48:03,431 --> 03:48:10,928
[SPEAKER_19]: We also need to note that, you know, this is about values and to understand that there is a

2691
03:48:12,040 --> 03:48:16,861
[SPEAKER_19]: even if there is a monetary impact that, number one, that that is limited.

2692
03:48:17,281 --> 03:48:25,924
[SPEAKER_19]: During the first administration, they tried a lot to see what they could do to coerce municipalities to align with their federal agenda on this.

2693
03:48:27,024 --> 03:48:27,904
[SPEAKER_19]: The answer was not a lot.

2694
03:48:29,224 --> 03:48:31,325
[SPEAKER_19]: And the restrictions on funding were minimal.

2695
03:48:31,765 --> 03:48:35,466
[SPEAKER_19]: And the second is just a realization that our values are worth more than that.

2696
03:48:37,673 --> 03:48:43,095
[SPEAKER_19]: The federal impact is limited to certain, very, very certain streams of funding.

2697
03:48:43,135 --> 03:48:50,098
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not limited, it's not so expansive as to include much of what we actually get from the federal government.

2698
03:48:51,439 --> 03:49:01,984
[SPEAKER_19]: On Councilor Collins' points, I think it underscores one other thing, the importance of this to the taxpayer.

2699
03:49:02,844 --> 03:49:04,726
[SPEAKER_19]: there's lots that our city is doing.

2700
03:49:05,187 --> 03:49:11,033
[SPEAKER_19]: There's no doubt that there's more to do than we have the capacity for.

2701
03:49:11,454 --> 03:49:13,676
[SPEAKER_19]: And so that's the situation that we're in.

2702
03:49:14,597 --> 03:49:21,305
[SPEAKER_19]: It shouldn't be on our local police department that is already working so hard on local safety.

2703
03:49:22,085 --> 03:49:31,192
[SPEAKER_19]: to enforce federal laws, especially given the nature of federalism in our country, especially given the separation of powers on different levels of government.

2704
03:49:31,592 --> 03:49:32,653
[SPEAKER_19]: And so that's what I would say.

2705
03:49:32,673 --> 03:49:38,978
[SPEAKER_19]: And I do appreciate the positive feedback and the strong support of our residents here.

2706
03:49:42,837 --> 03:49:47,581
[SPEAKER_29]: If I can, I would request that at least you not waive the three readings.

2707
03:49:48,442 --> 03:49:48,982
[SPEAKER_29]: I would hate.

2708
03:49:49,042 --> 03:49:49,422
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

2709
03:49:49,482 --> 03:49:50,543
[SPEAKER_24]: All right.

2710
03:49:51,204 --> 03:49:51,504
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2711
03:49:51,524 --> 03:49:57,709
[SPEAKER_29]: I just, I, again, I think that I talked to the chief.

2712
03:49:57,909 --> 03:50:02,753
[SPEAKER_29]: I think that it'd be something that it would be fruitful for us to understand the process.

2713
03:50:02,813 --> 03:50:03,153
[SPEAKER_29]: That's all.

2714
03:50:03,934 --> 03:50:08,898
[SPEAKER_29]: And again, with the last administration, both the house and the Senate now fall

2715
03:50:10,071 --> 03:50:10,811
[SPEAKER_29]: with one party.

2716
03:50:10,871 --> 03:50:28,519
[SPEAKER_29]: So, there's going to be a that's something that when I've talked to my my contacts at the higher level, this is what the fair is now is understanding that there isn't an option to stop the process.

2717
03:50:28,759 --> 03:50:30,040
[SPEAKER_24]: So, so, okay.

2718
03:50:30,920 --> 03:50:31,200
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2719
03:50:31,221 --> 03:50:31,621
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2720
03:50:31,661 --> 03:50:31,941
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll go to

2721
03:50:37,287 --> 03:50:41,232
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah, I also not inclined to agree with any sort of waiving of three readings.

2722
03:50:41,272 --> 03:50:42,393
[SPEAKER_37]: I think the three readings are good.

2723
03:50:42,613 --> 03:50:45,076
[SPEAKER_37]: Also, there were a lot of changes that just came in recently.

2724
03:50:45,176 --> 03:50:48,600
[SPEAKER_37]: So I think, you know, I'm comfortable passing it for first reading.

2725
03:50:49,701 --> 03:50:55,508
[SPEAKER_37]: It'll, you know, give me a chance to go through line by line every single change that was made, which I know was recommended by KP law.

2726
03:50:57,433 --> 03:51:08,633
[SPEAKER_37]: And I would be perfectly fine if we want to make an official request that in between our first reading and the third reading that we ask the police chief to come to a

2727
03:51:10,029 --> 03:51:12,510
[SPEAKER_24]: I believe he's been invited, but he can continue to be invited again.

2728
03:51:12,610 --> 03:51:13,571
[SPEAKER_24]: I understand that, yeah.

2729
03:51:13,771 --> 03:51:18,454
[SPEAKER_37]: But I think it's a different request when it's past first reading.

2730
03:51:18,674 --> 03:51:28,840
[SPEAKER_37]: So if we want to make a request that he show up to a committee meeting where we can discuss this and any reservations he has, I would be open to that as well.

2731
03:51:29,740 --> 03:51:35,964
[SPEAKER_24]: Because this is moving for a first reading, there can't be a committee meeting on it, but we could discuss it when it's up for third reading.

2732
03:51:36,844 --> 03:51:37,885
[SPEAKER_37]: So we get it in between.

2733
03:51:38,305 --> 03:51:40,647
[SPEAKER_24]: We can't hold a committee meeting on a paper that's not in queue.

2734
03:51:42,048 --> 03:51:42,829
[SPEAKER_37]: Ah, yeah, right.

2735
03:51:43,169 --> 03:51:43,309
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

2736
03:51:43,329 --> 03:51:45,210
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm also happy.

2737
03:51:46,631 --> 03:51:52,416
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, that whether you do or don't, it's not happening.

2738
03:51:52,736 --> 03:51:54,557
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, I hear you.

2739
03:51:54,597 --> 03:51:57,439
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm just saying it doesn't, there's no extra vote that's needed on it.

2740
03:51:57,660 --> 03:51:59,121
[SPEAKER_24]: So it doesn't save 10 seconds.

2741
03:52:00,442 --> 03:52:05,045
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, any further discussion by members of the council, like councilor Leming.

2742
03:52:06,324 --> 03:52:21,630
[SPEAKER_33]: Yeah, so I just would like to reiterate that I did reach out to all members of the school committee as well as Chief Buckley and asked all of them to submit their feedback.

2743
03:52:22,030 --> 03:52:31,234
[SPEAKER_33]: I invited the chief over to the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee meeting with any concerns or feedback that he might have.

2744
03:52:31,274 --> 03:52:33,775
[SPEAKER_33]: I did not receive a reply.

2745
03:52:34,594 --> 03:52:48,857
[SPEAKER_33]: to that request and I did receive some from the from the school committee and their feedback was incorporated into it into this draft.

2746
03:52:48,877 --> 03:52:55,619
[SPEAKER_33]: The concern that I had, the concern that I ran into from the administration regarding the

2747
03:52:57,766 --> 03:53:06,431
[SPEAKER_33]: regarding the police mainly had to do with the enforcement clause, which I was told could interfere with police union negotiations.

2748
03:53:06,511 --> 03:53:10,853
[SPEAKER_33]: And in this current draft, that ended up being nixed.

2749
03:53:11,413 --> 03:53:21,879
[SPEAKER_33]: So I would like to point out that there were efforts to include that feedback into this draft.

2750
03:53:24,125 --> 03:53:30,230
[SPEAKER_33]: The other thing I'd like to point out is that there is a timeliness issue to this.

2751
03:53:31,652 --> 03:53:47,345
[SPEAKER_33]: The new administration takes office in late January, so I do think that more so than other ordinances, having a policy that protects our undocumented populations in early is essential to me.

2752
03:53:49,793 --> 03:53:54,536
[SPEAKER_33]: Um, I don't see I don't really see the need to try to weigh the three readings.

2753
03:53:54,556 --> 03:53:55,596
[SPEAKER_33]: That's unanimous.

2754
03:53:55,676 --> 03:53:58,898
[SPEAKER_33]: And, you know, obviously, my colleague is voiced his concern.

2755
03:53:58,938 --> 03:54:05,522
[SPEAKER_33]: So I would be fine with going for the with just approving the first reading tonight.

2756
03:54:05,582 --> 03:54:17,228
[SPEAKER_33]: I would ask that that motion be amended to specifically accept the edits that were that were proposed in this in this current draft because I didn't hear that.

2757
03:54:18,246 --> 03:54:20,267
[SPEAKER_33]: that that was explicitly said in the motion.

2758
03:54:20,507 --> 03:54:20,768
[SPEAKER_33]: Okay.

2759
03:54:20,928 --> 03:54:21,188
[SPEAKER_33]: Okay.

2760
03:54:22,129 --> 03:54:22,309
[SPEAKER_33]: Yeah.

2761
03:54:22,849 --> 03:54:24,110
[SPEAKER_33]: Otherwise, that's all I got.

2762
03:54:24,170 --> 03:54:24,490
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

2763
03:54:25,451 --> 03:54:25,691
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2764
03:54:25,711 --> 03:54:27,312
[SPEAKER_24]: Any further discussion by members of the Council?

2765
03:54:28,352 --> 03:54:44,082
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm just going to say very quickly that on this and the next ordinance, a very dangerous federal administration with a very particular and specific agenda is going to be coming into place in about a month.

2766
03:54:44,803 --> 03:54:44,983
[SPEAKER_24]: And

2767
03:54:48,402 --> 03:55:10,234
[SPEAKER_24]: As a council, I think it is responsible and essential of us to act by passing a law that lets the people in this community know that the police of this city are not going to enact an agenda that weaponizes people's identities, people's documentation status, people's very livelihoods.

2768
03:55:12,175 --> 03:55:13,116
[SPEAKER_24]: And that is essential.

2769
03:55:14,954 --> 03:55:16,695
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, there might be consequences.

2770
03:55:17,215 --> 03:55:27,719
[SPEAKER_24]: We may not get the FBI grant for, I don't know, whatever, more, we might not get the weapons that come for a discounted rate or something, right?

2771
03:55:28,180 --> 03:55:32,782
[SPEAKER_24]: These certain things that the Department of Justice and other agencies send to municipalities.

2772
03:55:34,322 --> 03:55:43,426
[SPEAKER_24]: To me, that is a very small cost to standing up for what's right, standing up for our values and letting, again, the people of this community know that they will be safe

2773
03:55:44,130 --> 03:55:53,776
[SPEAKER_24]: If they want to report an incident to a Medford police officer, that they don't have to be afraid for their livelihoods and their ability to stay in this country.

2774
03:55:54,756 --> 03:56:00,639
[SPEAKER_24]: If they want to be a witness in another case, if they just want to be a good citizen, right?

2775
03:56:00,659 --> 03:56:02,681
[SPEAKER_24]: And there's a lot of other reasons too.

2776
03:56:03,661 --> 03:56:06,503
[SPEAKER_24]: Folks who are pulled over, folks who are questioned or whatever those might be.

2777
03:56:07,332 --> 03:56:23,276
[SPEAKER_24]: They shouldn't also have to have that added fear that they may well not be going home to their kids, because what we've heard over and over again in the last administration, and quite frankly, this administration seems dangerously more competent to implement this horrific agenda, is that kids went home after school and their parents were gone.

2778
03:56:24,096 --> 03:56:26,937
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's not something that we should have in this city.

2779
03:56:28,438 --> 03:56:30,058
[SPEAKER_24]: With that, I will go to the podium.

2780
03:56:30,078 --> 03:56:31,238
[SPEAKER_24]: Name and address for the record, please.

2781
03:56:31,278 --> 03:56:31,898
[SPEAKER_24]: You have three minutes.

2782
03:56:31,938 --> 03:56:33,919
[SPEAKER_24]: If you'd like to speak on this item, you can raise your hand on Zoom.

2783
03:56:36,189 --> 03:56:49,396
[SPEAKER_43]: But my name is Lisa Vienneau and I live at 19 Paul Road and I just wanted to say that I work in a sanctuary city in Chelsea and I also worked as a teacher in Cambridge.

2784
03:56:50,096 --> 03:56:55,639
[SPEAKER_43]: So I know what sanctuary cities kind of feel like and I think it's a huge undertaking to just

2785
03:56:56,679 --> 03:56:58,540
[SPEAKER_43]: say that we can be a sanctuary city.

2786
03:56:58,580 --> 03:57:15,205
[SPEAKER_43]: I think I kind of like agree with Mr. Scarpelli that it has to be a little thought out because even though it's the correct thing to do, I think we have to know like just like what the police chief thinks and what the, how much money is involved.

2787
03:57:15,245 --> 03:57:23,267
[SPEAKER_43]: And just like, I think that you just can't accept something like that as big as that without some thought.

2788
03:57:23,287 --> 03:57:26,228
[SPEAKER_43]: I mean, we just got like a really bad report from

2789
03:57:27,153 --> 03:57:32,657
[SPEAKER_43]: saying that we really don't look good as a city with a lot of things that we do.

2790
03:57:32,817 --> 03:57:38,141
[SPEAKER_43]: So I would want us to have a really good plan in place if we take this on.

2791
03:57:38,661 --> 03:57:50,369
[SPEAKER_43]: I don't think that we can just always embrace everything and say, yeah, that girl just said something really bad about the city, that we don't have a good mark when it comes to

2792
03:57:51,584 --> 03:57:52,705
[SPEAKER_43]: like presenting.

2793
03:57:52,865 --> 03:57:58,190
[SPEAKER_43]: So I just think that if you're going to take on a big project like this, you have to think about it.

2794
03:57:58,710 --> 03:57:59,791
[SPEAKER_43]: It's correct to do it.

2795
03:57:59,952 --> 03:58:03,775
[SPEAKER_43]: It is correct to do it, but you have to think about it and execute it correctly.

2796
03:58:03,935 --> 03:58:06,097
[SPEAKER_43]: You can't just be, wow, this is great.

2797
03:58:06,137 --> 03:58:06,678
[SPEAKER_43]: Let's do it.

2798
03:58:06,738 --> 03:58:07,038
[SPEAKER_43]: Yeah.

2799
03:58:08,279 --> 03:58:09,900
[SPEAKER_43]: We get bad grades everywhere else.

2800
03:58:10,181 --> 03:58:12,963
[SPEAKER_43]: Let's make sure we do this one appropriately.

2801
03:58:13,063 --> 03:58:14,424
[SPEAKER_43]: So it doesn't look bad.

2802
03:58:15,746 --> 03:58:16,086
[SPEAKER_43]: That's all.

2803
03:58:16,684 --> 03:58:17,144
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2804
03:58:17,764 --> 03:58:19,165
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm going to switch to Zoom.

2805
03:58:19,205 --> 03:58:20,165
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll go to Munir Germanis.

2806
03:58:20,966 --> 03:58:22,226
[SPEAKER_24]: Name and address for the record, please.

2807
03:58:22,266 --> 03:58:22,967
[SPEAKER_24]: You have three minutes.

2808
03:58:28,129 --> 03:58:29,649
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Munir Germanis.

2809
03:58:30,030 --> 03:58:32,250
[SPEAKER_02]: I live at 3 Summit Road in Medford.

2810
03:58:33,971 --> 03:58:40,234
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm here to really enthusiastically support this effort.

2811
03:58:40,974 --> 03:58:43,735
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not a random effort.

2812
03:58:43,835 --> 03:58:45,616
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a well thought out effort.

2813
03:58:46,095 --> 03:58:54,400
[SPEAKER_02]: We are just confirming what our current police policies right now is doing.

2814
03:58:55,841 --> 03:59:15,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, we're here to help the police not waste their time on following rumors and potential immigrants who may or may not be documented, just to make sure that we satisfy some

2815
03:59:16,348 --> 03:59:18,409
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody way up high in the federal government.

2816
03:59:19,369 --> 03:59:21,249
[SPEAKER_02]: I myself am an immigrant.

2817
03:59:21,990 --> 03:59:27,191
[SPEAKER_02]: I worked for many years in research with a lot of people.

2818
03:59:27,211 --> 03:59:38,994
[SPEAKER_02]: I had colleagues from New Zealand, from England, from India, from Russia, from Ukraine, from all over the world.

2819
03:59:39,975 --> 03:59:44,936
[SPEAKER_02]: And our company was first class because of their contributions.

2820
03:59:45,882 --> 04:00:00,772
[SPEAKER_02]: I already hear rumors and news, not only rumors, but news, actual news of businesses closing down because some of the employees are afraid to show up because of this.

2821
04:00:01,633 --> 04:00:05,355
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are a lot of positive things that will come out of this.

2822
04:00:05,935 --> 04:00:13,881
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wholeheartedly support this and I implore the entire city council to support it right now.

2823
04:00:14,441 --> 04:00:15,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks very much for your attention.

2824
04:00:17,861 --> 04:00:18,362
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2825
04:00:19,763 --> 04:00:21,285
[SPEAKER_24]: I'll go to the podium.

2826
04:00:21,325 --> 04:00:22,467
[SPEAKER_24]: Name and address for the record, please.

2827
04:00:22,507 --> 04:00:24,089
[SPEAKER_24]: You have three minutes and then we'll go back to Zoom.

2828
04:00:26,837 --> 04:00:27,217
[SPEAKER_46]: Good evening.

2829
04:00:27,257 --> 04:00:28,397
[SPEAKER_46]: My name is Laura Rotolo.

2830
04:00:28,437 --> 04:00:31,658
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm 14, Rita Drive, and I'm here wearing two hats this evening.

2831
04:00:31,818 --> 04:00:40,740
[SPEAKER_46]: One is a proud Medford resident, and also as part of the American Civil Liberties Union, where I work as field director and representing our 3,700 members here in Medford.

2832
04:00:41,240 --> 04:00:48,602
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm very proud to stand before you today to put our full support behind this ordinance, which has been many, many years in coming.

2833
04:00:49,082 --> 04:00:56,787
[SPEAKER_46]: There is nothing in this ordinance, I believe, that is at all inconsistent with what is current policy of the police and of the schools.

2834
04:00:57,147 --> 04:01:00,249
[SPEAKER_46]: That is what we have been told and that is what the police order says.

2835
04:01:00,750 --> 04:01:07,374
[SPEAKER_46]: That the current policies and practices are simply to focus on local issues and serving our local communities.

2836
04:01:07,774 --> 04:01:16,177
[SPEAKER_46]: and not doing the work of the federal government and not voluntarily collaborating with the federal government's deportation and immigration enforcement efforts.

2837
04:01:16,637 --> 04:01:19,879
[SPEAKER_46]: We believe this is wholly consistent with current practice.

2838
04:01:19,899 --> 04:01:21,819
[SPEAKER_46]: It has been looked at by KP law.

2839
04:01:23,020 --> 04:01:30,042
[SPEAKER_46]: And I think the moment that we're in right now, we're going back to the idea of what are our values as a welcoming city.

2840
04:01:30,623 --> 04:01:33,604
[SPEAKER_46]: It's important to enshrine those values in law.

2841
04:01:34,622 --> 04:01:40,167
[SPEAKER_46]: First of all, to let the community know what those values are, but also to let people know that this exists.

2842
04:01:40,267 --> 04:01:44,450
[SPEAKER_46]: If this policy is not well known in the community, then no one will take advantage of it.

2843
04:01:45,031 --> 04:01:51,336
[SPEAKER_46]: And the police will not be able to gain the trust of the residents who may not know this as current practice.

2844
04:01:52,237 --> 04:01:58,903
[SPEAKER_46]: And to the question about consequences and perhaps losing funding, I just want us to know that Medford is not alone here.

2845
04:01:59,483 --> 04:02:17,171
[SPEAKER_46]: The city of Boston has recently reaffirmed its trust act, which is very similar in nature, and many of our surrounding communities, including Somerville, Cambridge, Arlington, Chelsea, and Everett have similar policies, whether as an ordinance or as a police policy or as a practice.

2846
04:02:17,531 --> 04:02:18,612
[SPEAKER_46]: We are not alone here.

2847
04:02:19,492 --> 04:02:22,054
[SPEAKER_46]: anyone's going to defund Medford, they're going to defund all of us.

2848
04:02:23,255 --> 04:02:30,160
[SPEAKER_46]: We are not alone, and yet about a quarter of our residents are foreign born, and they do need these protections and this statement of our values.

2849
04:02:30,480 --> 04:02:37,366
[SPEAKER_46]: So thank you again for the City Council's willingness to take this up after, again, many years of work by many residents.

2850
04:02:37,426 --> 04:02:37,726
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

2851
04:02:38,546 --> 04:02:38,987
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2852
04:02:39,007 --> 04:02:40,468
[SPEAKER_24]: I will go to Zoom.

2853
04:02:41,248 --> 04:02:42,409
[SPEAKER_24]: Name and address for the record.

2854
04:02:43,450 --> 04:02:45,892
[SPEAKER_24]: Jamie Tallarita, you have three minutes on this item.

2855
04:02:47,515 --> 04:02:51,939
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just going to take, I'm 68 Charnwood Road, Janie Tallarita.

2856
04:02:52,019 --> 04:02:57,383
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just going to take 10 seconds and just say that I want to express my support as well.

2857
04:02:58,784 --> 04:02:59,424
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you so much.

2858
04:03:01,866 --> 04:03:02,827
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll go back to the podium.

2859
04:03:02,847 --> 04:03:05,289
[SPEAKER_24]: Name and address for the record, please.

2860
04:03:05,309 --> 04:03:06,410
[SPEAKER_24]: You have three minutes.

2861
04:03:07,150 --> 04:03:09,092
[SPEAKER_15]: Nick Giurleo, 40 Robinson Road.

2862
04:03:09,989 --> 04:03:10,489
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening.

2863
04:03:10,509 --> 04:03:20,854
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to comment tonight for the public, primarily coming before you as a licensed attorney just what exactly is in this welcoming city ordinance as I read it.

2864
04:03:21,774 --> 04:03:27,037
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's common for legislators and not just the city council, but really all legislators in general to use kind of

2865
04:03:27,947 --> 04:03:32,550
[SPEAKER_15]: soft kind of flowery language to describe what laws are really saying.

2866
04:03:32,990 --> 04:03:35,792
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think this welcoming ordinance is a pretty good example of that.

2867
04:03:36,592 --> 04:03:52,883
[SPEAKER_15]: What you might not realize, unless you actually read the fine print like I did, is that really the crux of it is not really to welcome anybody, but actually to just significantly hamper the police department's ability to do its job of working with fellow law enforcement to keep the community safe.

2868
04:03:53,803 --> 04:03:55,104
[SPEAKER_15]: So what do I mean by that?

2869
04:03:55,544 --> 04:04:03,350
[SPEAKER_15]: I think the ordinance essentially prevents the Medford Police Department from cooperating with all federal law enforcement and enforcing immigration laws.

2870
04:04:04,050 --> 04:04:14,277
[SPEAKER_15]: I think, in my opinion, this is not only illegal, but also a seriously concerning violation of the concept of limited government, or as we've been hearing a lot tonight, separation of powers.

2871
04:04:15,196 --> 04:04:25,361
[SPEAKER_15]: The ordinance, for example, says that Medford PD can't comply with immigration detainers, detainers being requests from the federal government to hold a person who's in the country unlawfully.

2872
04:04:26,331 --> 04:04:44,949
[SPEAKER_15]: So this means even if the Medford PD became aware a person was violating a federal immigration law, Medford PD wouldn't be allowed to do anything about it, which is confusing to me because it's the job of law enforcement agencies to enforce the laws and our city council and mayor making it essentially unlawful for them to do their jobs.

2873
04:04:46,359 --> 04:04:58,263
[SPEAKER_15]: The previous draft of the ordinance that I read mentioned a cause of action, basically giving an opportunity to sue the city at the taxpayer's expense if this ordinance were to be violated.

2874
04:04:58,343 --> 04:05:00,943
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm grateful to see that that's out of the ordinance now.

2875
04:05:01,404 --> 04:05:05,605
[SPEAKER_15]: But it was in there before, which I do think speaks to the motive behind this ordinance.

2876
04:05:06,885 --> 04:05:18,393
[SPEAKER_15]: Another thing that concerns me is the very end where it talks about the Medford Police Department, having to report data on its detainers, and you think that data would go to write to this legislator the city council but.

2877
04:05:19,507 --> 04:05:20,328
[SPEAKER_15]: That's not what it says.

2878
04:05:20,368 --> 04:05:22,829
[SPEAKER_15]: It goes right to the mayor, which is a little suspicious to me.

2879
04:05:23,770 --> 04:05:27,593
[SPEAKER_15]: So my legal opinion is I think this is a legal ordinance.

2880
04:05:28,233 --> 04:05:30,154
[SPEAKER_15]: And even if it isn't, it shouldn't be.

2881
04:05:30,514 --> 04:05:32,616
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think it just is a matter of policy, too.

2882
04:05:32,816 --> 04:05:33,456
[SPEAKER_15]: It's terrible.

2883
04:05:34,337 --> 04:05:35,197
[SPEAKER_15]: Shouldn't be on the books.

2884
04:05:35,638 --> 04:05:36,238
[SPEAKER_15]: That's my take.

2885
04:05:36,518 --> 04:05:36,899
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2886
04:05:37,599 --> 04:05:38,019
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2887
04:05:38,039 --> 04:05:41,682
[SPEAKER_24]: Go to the podium.

2888
04:05:41,722 --> 04:05:42,642
[SPEAKER_24]: Name and address for the record, please.

2889
04:05:42,662 --> 04:05:43,263
[SPEAKER_24]: You have three minutes.

2890
04:05:44,121 --> 04:05:53,028
[SPEAKER_38]: Elizabeth Burke from 12 Stephen Street, and I want to thank Councilors Tseng and Leming very much for their work on this, as well as the entire council for addressing this ordinance so quickly.

2891
04:05:53,628 --> 04:06:00,233
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm speaking today as part of Medford People Power, and this ordinance codifies what is already best practice in Medford.

2892
04:06:00,393 --> 04:06:07,819
[SPEAKER_38]: The Medford Police Department has had this policy in place since 2018, and it is a policy that Medford People Power advocated for then.

2893
04:06:08,479 --> 04:06:09,660
[SPEAKER_38]: It is not new for Medford.

2894
04:06:10,060 --> 04:06:17,905
[SPEAKER_38]: Codifying and expanding it to other departments in Medford sends a message to our immigrant communities, of which we have many, that they are safe and supported in Medford.

2895
04:06:18,586 --> 04:06:23,949
[SPEAKER_38]: This ordinance restricts Medford from cooperating in mass deportations that have nothing to do with criminal behavior.

2896
04:06:24,330 --> 04:06:27,432
[SPEAKER_38]: This ordinance does not interfere with criminal laws or a judicial warrant.

2897
04:06:27,852 --> 04:06:33,396
[SPEAKER_38]: It only restricts cooperation with ICE on administrative detainers and providing logistical support for raids.

2898
04:06:33,896 --> 04:06:37,699
[SPEAKER_38]: It also restricts Medford from cooperating with ICE on solely immigration matters.

2899
04:06:38,559 --> 04:06:46,823
[SPEAKER_38]: This matter is urgent because Trump plans to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants, which is the estimated total number of undocumented immigrants living in the U.S.

2900
04:06:47,564 --> 04:06:50,945
[SPEAKER_38]: Almost all of these immigrants will have no criminal history starting on day one.

2901
04:06:51,626 --> 04:06:57,869
[SPEAKER_38]: We don't know what this will look like, but based on the past administration, we know it will result in significant harm to families.

2902
04:06:59,085 --> 04:07:01,428
[SPEAKER_38]: Medford is not alone in passing these types of ordinances.

2903
04:07:01,888 --> 04:07:08,735
[SPEAKER_38]: Medford will join many other Massachusetts cities that are vowing to protect immigrants, including Boston, Cambridge, Somerville, and Arlington.

2904
04:07:09,716 --> 04:07:11,859
[SPEAKER_38]: Protecting our immigrant neighbors is the right thing to do.

2905
04:07:12,139 --> 04:07:14,802
[SPEAKER_38]: We need a functioning immigration system, and we don't have it.

2906
04:07:15,222 --> 04:07:17,404
[SPEAKER_38]: However, mass deportations are not the solution.

2907
04:07:17,785 --> 04:07:19,667
[SPEAKER_38]: This approach is mean-spirited and hateful.

2908
04:07:19,907 --> 04:07:21,489
[SPEAKER_38]: It treats people like they are less than human.

2909
04:07:22,029 --> 04:07:23,131
[SPEAKER_38]: Medford is better than that.

2910
04:07:23,191 --> 04:07:26,096
[SPEAKER_38]: We value community and coming together to solve problems.

2911
04:07:26,176 --> 04:07:27,598
[SPEAKER_38]: We value respect for each other.

2912
04:07:27,979 --> 04:07:29,781
[SPEAKER_38]: This ordinance brings out the best in Medford.

2913
04:07:30,162 --> 04:07:30,442
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

2914
04:07:31,564 --> 04:07:31,985
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2915
04:07:32,005 --> 04:07:33,787
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll stay at the podium.

2916
04:07:34,388 --> 04:07:35,630
[SPEAKER_24]: Name and address for the record, please.

2917
04:07:35,650 --> 04:07:36,371
[SPEAKER_24]: You have three minutes.

2918
04:07:37,901 --> 04:07:52,746
[SPEAKER_39]: Hi, my name is Anna Meyer I live at six Douglas Road, and I'm here tonight as a high school history teacher, and it's really important me to speak on this even though it's way too late for a school night, but I really want to just kind of share some experiences of my students.

2919
04:07:53,866 --> 04:07:57,869
[SPEAKER_39]: I used to work in Providence with newcomer students, many of whom were seeking asylum.

2920
04:07:57,889 --> 04:08:01,511
[SPEAKER_39]: And I would have students taking calls from lawyers during the school day.

2921
04:08:01,531 --> 04:08:05,314
[SPEAKER_39]: A lot of them were from rural Guatemala.

2922
04:08:05,334 --> 04:08:09,497
[SPEAKER_39]: They'd ridden trains, on the top of trains, through Mexico to reach the US.

2923
04:08:10,117 --> 04:08:16,761
[SPEAKER_39]: And I just saw firsthand what that instability looked like for them and the way that it affected their ability to concentrate in the classroom.

2924
04:08:17,402 --> 04:08:19,283
[SPEAKER_39]: I also taught in New York City for four years.

2925
04:08:19,323 --> 04:08:21,405
[SPEAKER_39]: I had students from the Dominican Republic and West Africa.

2926
04:08:22,625 --> 04:08:23,986
[SPEAKER_39]: Central America and other places.

2927
04:08:24,827 --> 04:08:34,054
[SPEAKER_39]: And I also saw firsthand from them what it did to face immigration uncertainty, to be separated from their families, to not know when they could travel there or their families could travel back to see them in New York.

2928
04:08:35,015 --> 04:08:41,881
[SPEAKER_39]: And the way that detention and incarceration just like was so deeply distressing to students and to see how hard it was to concentrate in school.

2929
04:08:42,942 --> 04:09:01,378
[SPEAKER_39]: And I stand in favor of this resolution because I think it will do so much to at least alleviate that burden the way that we can in Medford, just to make sure that students and families have a little bit of that fear alleviated so that they can interact with services in the city and schools and just know that their community is doing what it can to protect them.

2930
04:09:02,158 --> 04:09:10,724
[SPEAKER_39]: And then I think beyond that, it sends a really important message to our immigrant community that we care about them and we'll do what we can in Medford to protect them.

2931
04:09:11,224 --> 04:09:29,356
[SPEAKER_39]: And I think in addition to all that's been said about the potential of deportations, I also just think the anti-immigrant rhetoric that's happening in this country is obviously as old as the United States itself, but the way that it's increased recently, I think that also takes a really important stand just to saying to our residents and our students in particular that we don't stand for that in Medford.

2932
04:09:30,016 --> 04:09:31,378
[SPEAKER_39]: And it's a way of taking a stand there.

2933
04:09:31,438 --> 04:09:32,979
[SPEAKER_39]: So thank you so much for consideration.

2934
04:09:33,019 --> 04:09:34,100
[SPEAKER_39]: I hope you'll vote for it tonight.

2935
04:09:34,541 --> 04:09:36,142
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you so much, and good luck tomorrow morning.

2936
04:09:36,162 --> 04:09:41,668
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm going to go to Zoom to the Reverend Wendy Villarola-Padre.

2937
04:09:41,928 --> 04:09:43,149
[SPEAKER_24]: Name and address for the record, please.

2938
04:09:43,169 --> 04:09:44,631
[SPEAKER_24]: You have three minutes, Reverend Wendy.

2939
04:09:46,933 --> 04:09:47,453
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello.

2940
04:09:47,533 --> 04:09:48,494
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you hear me all right?

2941
04:09:49,896 --> 04:09:50,056
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

2942
04:09:50,629 --> 04:09:54,311
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much for staying up this late.

2943
04:09:54,351 --> 04:09:57,352
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening, members of the city council and dear neighbors.

2944
04:09:57,913 --> 04:10:02,555
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm Reverend Wendy Miller, well, I'm Wendy Miller Olapade and I live at 105 Brook Street.

2945
04:10:03,956 --> 04:10:08,538
[SPEAKER_10]: And I had the opportunity to share these thoughts with the committee.

2946
04:10:08,598 --> 04:10:12,760
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to say them kind of again, cause it's important.

2947
04:10:12,800 --> 04:10:15,622
[SPEAKER_10]: I've heard people asking about

2948
04:10:16,788 --> 04:10:17,909
[SPEAKER_10]: our values.

2949
04:10:19,550 --> 04:10:24,874
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm here to testify as an advocate for this ordinance for beloved community.

2950
04:10:24,894 --> 04:10:29,416
[SPEAKER_10]: I work really hard at making love and justice real.

2951
04:10:29,476 --> 04:10:33,819
[SPEAKER_10]: And I believe that we have to do that through our actions, our policies and our laws.

2952
04:10:34,640 --> 04:10:43,265
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm here as the president of the Medford Interfaith Clergy Association, where I am often asked to support immigrants in their faith communities.

2953
04:10:43,385 --> 04:10:44,226
[SPEAKER_10]: We have many

2954
04:10:44,710 --> 04:10:46,812
[SPEAKER_10]: immigrant faith communities in our city.

2955
04:10:47,613 --> 04:10:52,958
[SPEAKER_10]: I am the mother of two young men whose father is an immigrant, and I'm a proud resident of Medford.

2956
04:10:53,598 --> 04:11:01,185
[SPEAKER_10]: So I speak in support of this ordinance because of the values that I think we want to practice in our city.

2957
04:11:01,666 --> 04:11:02,767
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the right thing to do.

2958
04:11:03,442 --> 04:11:14,214
[SPEAKER_10]: And I want to say a word about how across our diverse social and faith traditions, there's one message that I hear constantly, it resonates clearly.

2959
04:11:14,735 --> 04:11:24,206
[SPEAKER_10]: And that is the call to welcome, protect, and uphold the dignity of all people, especially the stranger, the immigrant, and the marginalized.

2960
04:11:24,932 --> 04:11:34,776
[SPEAKER_10]: So becoming a welcoming city is not just an ordinance, it's a moral and spiritual imperative that's rooted in the shared values of all of our spiritual and faith traditions.

2961
04:11:35,617 --> 04:11:39,138
[SPEAKER_10]: In Christianity, the call to hospitality is unequivocal.

2962
04:11:39,218 --> 04:11:42,020
[SPEAKER_10]: The words of Jesus and the gospel of Matthew are clear.

2963
04:11:42,460 --> 04:11:45,381
[SPEAKER_10]: He said, I was a stranger and you welcomed me.

2964
04:11:46,001 --> 04:11:53,705
[SPEAKER_10]: And Paul writes in Hebrew, do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers for by doing that, some have entertained angels.

2965
04:11:54,195 --> 04:11:55,056
[SPEAKER_10]: without knowing it.

2966
04:11:55,756 --> 04:11:59,799
[SPEAKER_10]: In Judaism, the command to welcome the stranger is foundational.

2967
04:12:00,259 --> 04:12:05,082
[SPEAKER_10]: The Torah repeats it no fewer than 36 times, more than any other commandment.

2968
04:12:05,142 --> 04:12:10,406
[SPEAKER_10]: You shall love the stranger as yourself, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.

2969
04:12:11,066 --> 04:12:17,330
[SPEAKER_10]: This isn't about remembering our history, but about cultivating empathy and justice in our communities today.

2970
04:12:17,791 --> 04:12:22,534
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a reminder that our humanity is bound together by shared vulnerabilities,

2971
04:12:23,055 --> 04:12:24,596
[SPEAKER_10]: and shared aspirations.

2972
04:12:25,337 --> 04:12:29,819
[SPEAKER_10]: In Islam, the principles of hospitality and equity are deeply ingrained.

2973
04:12:29,839 --> 04:12:34,022
[SPEAKER_10]: The Quran commands believers to act with compassion and justice.

2974
04:12:34,582 --> 04:12:41,947
[SPEAKER_10]: Do good to parents, relatives, orphans, the needy, the neighbor who is near, the neighbor who is a stranger, and the traveler.

2975
04:12:42,808 --> 04:12:51,433
[SPEAKER_10]: And in Buddhism, the practice of metta, or loving kindness, teaches us to extend compassion to all beings without distinction.

2976
04:12:52,148 --> 04:13:10,793
[SPEAKER_10]: These shared spiritual values call us to act now, not out of fear or division, or worried about whether there'll be enough money, but out of love, justice and equity, becoming a welcoming city aligns Medford with the highest aspirations of our traditions of our values.

2977
04:13:11,158 --> 04:13:18,805
[SPEAKER_10]: to be a place where every resident, regardless of origin, is treated with dignity, and is free to live without fear.

2978
04:13:19,446 --> 04:13:29,575
[SPEAKER_10]: It also reflects the very foundation of our democracy and the history of America, as a nation built on the ideals of equality, inclusion,

2979
04:13:30,000 --> 04:13:32,721
[SPEAKER_10]: and the belief that all people are created equal.

2980
04:13:33,362 --> 04:13:42,446
[SPEAKER_10]: This ordinance reflects the heart of all of our faith traditions, our shared humanity, and the values that our city says it wants to live by.

2981
04:13:42,926 --> 04:13:51,450
[SPEAKER_10]: It strengthens our community by affirming that everyone is valued, all are welcome, and all deserve safety and respect.

2982
04:13:52,030 --> 04:13:56,132
[SPEAKER_10]: Let us live up to these sacred values and make this happen now.

2983
04:13:56,593 --> 04:13:58,393
[SPEAKER_10]: Declare Medford a welcoming city.

2984
04:13:59,054 --> 04:13:59,434
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

2985
04:14:01,854 --> 04:14:02,334
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2986
04:14:02,354 --> 04:14:06,356
[SPEAKER_08]: Go to the podium, name and address for the record, please.

2987
04:14:06,396 --> 04:14:07,036
[SPEAKER_08]: You have three minutes.

2988
04:14:07,896 --> 04:14:11,338
[SPEAKER_08]: William Navarre, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

2989
04:14:15,119 --> 04:14:25,143
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to make a different point that others have made, and that's that we really want to avoid getting swept up in Trump's plan for mass deportations.

2990
04:14:26,363 --> 04:14:30,225
[SPEAKER_08]: Our mayor and our chief of staff have wisely put in these policies.

2991
04:14:31,192 --> 04:14:44,278
[SPEAKER_08]: And we should recognize that Trump and the right-wing media and so on, his whole apparatus has a really good skill of making the unthinkable thinkable.

2992
04:14:45,038 --> 04:14:48,740
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's why we need to say, no, we're sticking to these policies.

2993
04:14:48,840 --> 04:14:52,902
[SPEAKER_08]: We're sticking to our liberal values and we're not going back on that.

2994
04:14:52,922 --> 04:14:54,203
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not backsliding.

2995
04:14:54,243 --> 04:14:55,663
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the term that's sometimes used.

2996
04:14:55,883 --> 04:14:58,845
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's why I think it's so important that this be passed, that it be an ordinance.

2997
04:14:59,656 --> 04:15:10,681
[SPEAKER_08]: because it's so easy to just whittle away at these things, get swept up in a trend, get swept up in the national rhetoric.

2998
04:15:11,161 --> 04:15:18,345
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe the unthinkable will not just be thinkable, it'll be moderate in a year, in two years.

2999
04:15:20,446 --> 04:15:23,487
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you have a chance now to make the unthinkable illegal.

3000
04:15:24,448 --> 04:15:28,970
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what you need to do to make sure that you don't get caught up into that craziness

3001
04:15:30,718 --> 04:15:32,679
[SPEAKER_08]: that Trump wants to visit upon our country.

3002
04:15:32,719 --> 04:15:33,099
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

3003
04:15:33,559 --> 04:15:33,980
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

3004
04:15:34,000 --> 04:15:37,321
[SPEAKER_24]: Go to the podium, name and address for the record, please.

3005
04:15:37,341 --> 04:15:38,002
[SPEAKER_24]: You have three minutes.

3006
04:15:39,262 --> 04:15:39,783
[SPEAKER_48]: Good evening.

3007
04:15:41,324 --> 04:15:43,325
[SPEAKER_48]: Jean Zotter, 36 Saunders Street.

3008
04:15:43,345 --> 04:15:47,087
[SPEAKER_48]: It's way past my bedtime, so I'm going to cut to the chase.

3009
04:15:48,368 --> 04:15:53,412
[SPEAKER_48]: It was hard to tell what the amendments were that I couldn't really see it on the screen.

3010
04:15:53,432 --> 04:15:58,395
[SPEAKER_48]: I know that KP Law had some concerns around the enforcement section.

3011
04:15:59,276 --> 04:16:00,697
[SPEAKER_48]: Those changes are fine with us.

3012
04:16:01,617 --> 04:16:05,540
[SPEAKER_48]: There were some changes KP Law suggested for order section 5103.

3013
04:16:09,302 --> 04:16:12,644
[SPEAKER_48]: that seem to weaken what is our current policy.

3014
04:16:12,664 --> 04:16:25,609
[SPEAKER_48]: So while we don't know what the final edits were to the ordinance, we would just encourage that it not weaken what is already our existing policy and has been enforced for at least six years.

3015
04:16:26,209 --> 04:16:34,952
[SPEAKER_48]: So without knowing that, we just wanted to make that one comment and appreciate you taking this up quickly and understanding the urgency of this matter.

3016
04:16:34,972 --> 04:16:36,053
[SPEAKER_48]: Thank you for your time.

3017
04:16:36,613 --> 04:16:37,353
[SPEAKER_24]: I appreciate that.

3018
04:16:37,393 --> 04:16:37,954
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Jean.

3019
04:16:40,267 --> 04:16:45,972
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Leming, do you want to, I really don't think, I would really prefer that you stop sharing the screen.

3020
04:16:46,012 --> 04:16:50,815
[SPEAKER_24]: At this point, I personally cannot handle looking at the lines of legal text.

3021
04:16:50,956 --> 04:17:02,044
[SPEAKER_24]: If you could explain changes or explain who you've communicated with about those changes beyond KP law, or that we could have a further discussion between now and the third reading, I think that would be my preference.

3022
04:17:02,485 --> 04:17:08,470
[SPEAKER_24]: I just appreciate folks dealing with the fact that I just can't look at green line changes at this point.

3023
04:17:12,092 --> 04:17:28,922
[SPEAKER_33]: No, so I corresponded with the folks at both the folks at KP Law and Medford People Power, including Lauren Jean about this earlier today.

3024
04:17:28,942 --> 04:17:36,487
[SPEAKER_33]: So the, I believe it was Jean was talking about 5103C.

3025
04:17:37,087 --> 04:17:38,728
[SPEAKER_33]: Was that what she mentioned?

3026
04:17:39,474 --> 04:17:40,215
[SPEAKER_24]: or nodding yes.

3027
04:17:41,115 --> 04:17:42,256
[SPEAKER_33]: Yeah.

3028
04:17:44,378 --> 04:18:03,713
[SPEAKER_33]: Yeah, so I put into this current draft the one change that was proposed for that, that they proposed for that, which was that no Asian officer employee of the city in performance of official duties shall make any inquiry about citizenship, immigration, or residency status.

3029
04:18:03,754 --> 04:18:07,016
[SPEAKER_33]: And they specifically wanted to make it so that they couldn't

3030
04:18:09,631 --> 04:18:12,552
[SPEAKER_33]: ask about immigration status.

3031
04:18:14,553 --> 04:18:24,178
[SPEAKER_33]: But I am not 100% sure where else this would have weakened it.

3032
04:18:24,198 --> 04:18:24,838
[SPEAKER_33]: So yeah, I did respond.

3033
04:18:24,938 --> 04:18:29,060
[SPEAKER_33]: I did respond.

3034
04:18:29,080 --> 04:18:29,280
[SPEAKER_33]: Yeah.

3035
04:18:37,865 --> 04:18:49,122
[SPEAKER_48]: The current police policy that the Medford Police Department is enforcing says that they cannot ask about immigration status unless relevant to a criminal case.

3036
04:18:50,543 --> 04:18:51,844
[SPEAKER_48]: So that's the current policy.

3037
04:18:51,864 --> 04:19:06,609
[SPEAKER_48]: The changes for KP law, and I can read it to you, say that they can only not ask about immigration status if a person is seeking to enforce their rights or attain benefits.

3038
04:19:07,429 --> 04:19:27,262
[SPEAKER_48]: So it's not clear what enforcing rights means, but it's very different to have a blanket policy that, if it's not relevant to a criminal investigation, you don't ask about immigration status, to changing it to, if a person, an immigrant, is seeking to enforce their rights,

3039
04:19:28,203 --> 04:19:32,028
[SPEAKER_48]: the police can't ask about their immigration status.

3040
04:19:32,468 --> 04:19:33,730
[SPEAKER_48]: So I'll give you an example.

3041
04:19:34,410 --> 04:19:38,936
[SPEAKER_48]: Say I have a busted taillight and I'm pulled over by the police.

3042
04:19:39,636 --> 04:19:45,443
[SPEAKER_48]: I'm not enforcing my rights, but the police, when they come to my car and say, your taillight is busted,

3043
04:19:46,524 --> 04:19:55,690
[SPEAKER_48]: Can they then ask about the immigration status of a person with a busted taillight, even though it's not relevant to why they pulled the person over?

3044
04:19:56,151 --> 04:20:06,878
[SPEAKER_48]: It's not clear from the changes from KP law that that, I don't know if this is making sense, and I know we're all tired, but their changes seem to weaken what the police can do.

3045
04:20:07,381 --> 04:20:13,245
[SPEAKER_24]: I think Matt, if you could read that sentence and then Jean, if you could read that existing sentence from the existing policy.

3046
04:20:14,505 --> 04:20:35,038
[SPEAKER_33]: So the deleted one was the struck through version was no officers or employees of the city of Medford may inquire about the immigration status of a victim, suspect, arrestee, 911 caller or other member of the public with whom they have contact except as required by state law or to provide a public benefit and the

3047
04:20:36,152 --> 04:20:53,677
[SPEAKER_33]: replacement was no agent, officer or employee of the city in the performance of official duties shall make any inquiry about the citizenship, immigration or residency status of any person seeking to enforce rights or obtain benefits or discriminate in the enforcement of rights or the granting

3048
04:20:54,306 --> 04:21:06,448
[SPEAKER_33]: of benefits on such basis, unless federal or Massachusetts law so requires for the termination of eligibility of benefits or as may otherwise be required by law or a court of competent jurisdiction.

3049
04:21:06,468 --> 04:21:16,510
[SPEAKER_33]: No police officer or any city employee shall inquire about the citizenship or immigration status of any victim or witness of domestic violence or any other crime except as required by law.

3050
04:21:16,530 --> 04:21:18,811
[SPEAKER_33]: That's it.

3051
04:21:21,928 --> 04:21:22,728
[SPEAKER_46]: Jean or Laura.

3052
04:21:22,888 --> 04:21:24,389
[SPEAKER_46]: Yeah, I can jump in on that as well.

3053
04:21:24,469 --> 04:21:24,809
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

3054
04:21:25,309 --> 04:21:37,672
[SPEAKER_46]: So the current police policy says that officers shall not question any person, so any person, about their specific citizenship or immigration status unless such information is required by law.

3055
04:21:37,692 --> 04:21:49,136
[SPEAKER_46]: And the changes to the ordinance by KP law said that only, as Jean said, if a person is seeking to enforce their rights, would that prohibition apply?

3056
04:21:49,196 --> 04:21:50,256
[SPEAKER_46]: It's much narrower.

3057
04:21:50,856 --> 04:22:03,402
[SPEAKER_46]: We want to make sure that the police cannot ask about immigration status of anyone that they come into contact with, whether it's somebody they pull over, somebody they're investigating, interrogating, or someone who's seeking to enforce their rights.

3058
04:22:03,442 --> 04:22:10,885
[SPEAKER_24]: Was the language that Councilor Leming read prior to the amendment received late today by KP Law in line with the policy in your opinion?

3059
04:22:11,805 --> 04:22:13,926
[SPEAKER_48]: The previous language was.

3060
04:22:14,086 --> 04:22:14,186
[SPEAKER_24]: OK.

3061
04:22:14,206 --> 04:22:14,446
[SPEAKER_24]: Got it.

3062
04:22:14,586 --> 04:22:19,048
[SPEAKER_48]: The changes proposed significantly weakened.

3063
04:22:19,569 --> 04:22:19,889
[SPEAKER_24]: Got it.

3064
04:22:20,209 --> 04:22:20,369
[SPEAKER_24]: OK.

3065
04:22:23,233 --> 04:22:24,554
[SPEAKER_24]: I'll go to Councilor Callahan.

3066
04:22:27,716 --> 04:22:39,927
[SPEAKER_37]: I was just going to suggest that maybe public comment at this meeting is not the best, like given that late hour and everything else is maybe not exactly when we want to be line by lining, you know, specific wording and that

3067
04:22:41,943 --> 04:22:48,806
[SPEAKER_37]: you know, the sponsors of the legislation working with, you know, like between now and third reading.

3068
04:22:48,826 --> 04:22:55,209
[SPEAKER_37]: Does that make sense that that might be a better way to make edits that may be doing it right now?

3069
04:22:55,229 --> 04:22:59,551
[SPEAKER_24]: I think at this point, we've talked through the one I agree with you going forward on the rest of it.

3070
04:23:00,492 --> 04:23:08,796
[SPEAKER_24]: It does sound like maybe if someone wanted to make the motion to adopt all of the amendments from KPLL except for that amendment, and then we can do the rest.

3071
04:23:09,436 --> 04:23:10,757
[SPEAKER_24]: I think it's working.

3072
04:23:15,904 --> 04:23:17,084
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3073
04:23:18,084 --> 04:23:20,945
[SPEAKER_24]: So, Councilor Collins, are you making a motion?

3074
04:23:20,965 --> 04:23:26,387
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I'm sorry.

3075
04:23:26,427 --> 04:23:29,168
[SPEAKER_18]: I lost track of the 5013C.

3076
04:23:29,188 --> 04:23:32,649
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry, couldn't hear that.

3077
04:23:33,830 --> 04:23:36,171
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll just finish my sentence.

3078
04:23:36,191 --> 04:23:36,551
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

3079
04:23:36,571 --> 04:23:37,851
[SPEAKER_24]: Give Councilor Collins a floor.

3080
04:23:37,871 --> 04:23:38,231
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

3081
04:23:39,412 --> 04:23:43,013
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd be happy to make the motion to approve

3082
04:23:45,180 --> 04:23:46,540
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry, late.

3083
04:23:48,581 --> 04:24:01,223
[SPEAKER_18]: Take a vote for approved for first reading with the amendments presented tonight adopted with the exception of that one amendment that Councilor Leming knows the number of.

3084
04:24:06,344 --> 04:24:09,565
[SPEAKER_24]: Jean, could you just say the section number for me again?

3085
04:24:12,899 --> 04:24:15,201
[SPEAKER_24]: 50-103 subsection C. Thank you.

3086
04:24:20,225 --> 04:24:20,505
[SPEAKER_24]: Got it.

3087
04:24:20,585 --> 04:24:20,785
[SPEAKER_24]: All right.

3088
04:24:20,805 --> 04:24:21,866
[SPEAKER_24]: We're going to go back to the podium.

3089
04:24:23,207 --> 04:24:24,368
[SPEAKER_24]: Name and address for the record, please.

3090
04:24:24,388 --> 04:24:25,129
[SPEAKER_24]: You have three minutes.

3091
04:24:27,050 --> 04:24:28,592
[SPEAKER_22]: Nate Merritt, 373 Riverside Ave.

3092
04:24:29,927 --> 04:24:36,371
[SPEAKER_22]: I guess I'm a little confused at this, where, first off, is this a sanctuary city policy or not?

3093
04:24:36,572 --> 04:24:38,173
[SPEAKER_24]: This is a welcoming city ordinance.

3094
04:24:38,193 --> 04:24:38,433
[SPEAKER_22]: No, no, no.

3095
04:24:38,513 --> 04:24:40,334
[SPEAKER_22]: Is it a sanctuary city policy or not?

3096
04:24:40,374 --> 04:24:41,475
[SPEAKER_22]: You can call it whatever you want.

3097
04:24:41,515 --> 04:24:42,555
[SPEAKER_22]: Is it a sanctuary city policy?

3098
04:24:42,575 --> 04:24:43,876
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Merritt, I'm just going to give you your time.

3099
04:24:45,417 --> 04:24:46,138
[SPEAKER_22]: No, it was a question.

3100
04:24:46,918 --> 04:24:47,659
[SPEAKER_22]: You have three minutes.

3101
04:24:48,339 --> 04:24:49,600
[SPEAKER_22]: So you won't answer yes or no.

3102
04:24:49,720 --> 04:24:51,461
[SPEAKER_22]: Two minutes and 30 seconds you have, Mr. Merritt.

3103
04:24:51,661 --> 04:24:52,362
[SPEAKER_22]: It's been 15.

3104
04:24:52,862 --> 04:24:53,082
[SPEAKER_22]: OK.

3105
04:24:53,543 --> 04:24:58,466
[SPEAKER_22]: So how you do something is just as important as what you do.

3106
04:25:00,086 --> 04:25:02,988
[SPEAKER_22]: I come from a family of immigrants.

3107
04:25:03,148 --> 04:25:04,169
[SPEAKER_22]: My wife is an immigrant.

3108
04:25:04,209 --> 04:25:05,430
[SPEAKER_22]: She was not born in this country.

3109
04:25:05,490 --> 04:25:08,652
[SPEAKER_22]: My in-laws were not born in this country.

3110
04:25:09,253 --> 04:25:10,573
[SPEAKER_22]: They are not in fear of anything.

3111
04:25:10,654 --> 04:25:17,478
[SPEAKER_22]: They're not in fear of getting, my wife gets, you know, she has had a car accident, never got hauled away.

3112
04:25:18,159 --> 04:25:23,923
[SPEAKER_22]: You have a city Councilor who's held to a higher standard to serve and protect this country, right?

3113
04:25:24,103 --> 04:25:29,527
[SPEAKER_22]: And he comes under a whole different set of rules, federal rules, Uniform Code of Military Justice.

3114
04:25:31,035 --> 04:25:36,677
[SPEAKER_22]: What are we saying if we say we're going to choose to enforce some rules that we like and not the others?

3115
04:25:37,937 --> 04:25:39,177
[SPEAKER_22]: I have to teach my kids this.

3116
04:25:40,278 --> 04:25:41,558
[SPEAKER_22]: And there are laws for a reason.

3117
04:25:41,758 --> 04:25:53,221
[SPEAKER_22]: I think it's a slippery slope when this city chooses to get involved in certain things that they like with a current administration and then others that they won't stand with because the administration is going to change.

3118
04:25:53,781 --> 04:25:59,143
[SPEAKER_22]: Why not just stay out of it, in a sense, and let the federal government and things at the federal level work?

3119
04:26:00,117 --> 04:26:00,958
[SPEAKER_22]: the way they're going to work.

3120
04:26:00,978 --> 04:26:01,739
[SPEAKER_22]: There's federal laws.

3121
04:26:01,759 --> 04:26:04,361
[SPEAKER_22]: If we don't like them, elect new people.

3122
04:26:04,821 --> 04:26:07,003
[SPEAKER_22]: That's been said tonight over and over.

3123
04:26:07,644 --> 04:26:14,450
[SPEAKER_22]: This council won't pass a resolution to say, don't drug test people in a line, right?

3124
04:26:14,811 --> 04:26:16,072
[SPEAKER_24]: We did pass that.

3125
04:26:17,553 --> 04:26:18,974
[SPEAKER_22]: No, I don't think they said not to.

3126
04:26:19,215 --> 04:26:20,236
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't think that was the resolution.

3127
04:26:20,256 --> 04:26:23,819
[SPEAKER_22]: It was to find out the financial impacts, but not to actually do it as a policy.

3128
04:26:24,778 --> 04:26:31,644
[SPEAKER_22]: And it certainly didn't pass when it says don't follow people around or private investigators when they're using their civil liberties, your own citizens.

3129
04:26:33,226 --> 04:26:39,131
[SPEAKER_22]: Definitely citizens, because I don't believe that the city can employ people who are not legal citizens.

3130
04:26:39,151 --> 04:26:39,792
[SPEAKER_22]: Is that true?

3131
04:26:40,012 --> 04:26:42,614
[SPEAKER_24]: The city can employ people who are not residents of the city of Medford.

3132
04:26:43,115 --> 04:26:45,417
[SPEAKER_22]: Can they employ foreign nationals?

3133
04:26:46,098 --> 04:26:46,238
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

3134
04:26:46,298 --> 04:26:46,658
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know.

3135
04:26:46,818 --> 04:26:47,759
[SPEAKER_22]: Absolutely.

3136
04:26:48,019 --> 04:26:49,701
[SPEAKER_22]: But legal documented foreign nationals.

3137
04:26:50,168 --> 04:26:52,889
[SPEAKER_22]: Can they employ undocumented people?

3138
04:26:53,329 --> 04:26:54,730
[SPEAKER_22]: Because that's what this is talking about.

3139
04:26:54,810 --> 04:26:55,711
[SPEAKER_24]: I apologize for interrupting.

3140
04:26:57,211 --> 04:27:03,234
[SPEAKER_22]: So if you're not willing to go to bat for your own employees, why are we doing this?

3141
04:27:04,735 --> 04:27:12,078
[SPEAKER_22]: And literally, what's on the table is to pass a law to potentially ignore some law.

3142
04:27:12,818 --> 04:27:13,939
[SPEAKER_22]: This doesn't make sense.

3143
04:27:15,140 --> 04:27:16,020
[SPEAKER_22]: I get the intent.

3144
04:27:17,677 --> 04:27:19,739
[SPEAKER_22]: but it doesn't make fundamental sense.

3145
04:27:19,779 --> 04:27:21,080
[SPEAKER_22]: We're a nation of laws or we're not.

3146
04:27:21,140 --> 04:27:22,542
[SPEAKER_22]: We're a community of laws or not.

3147
04:27:23,983 --> 04:27:24,323
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

3148
04:27:24,724 --> 04:27:25,124
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

3149
04:27:25,144 --> 04:27:29,348
[SPEAKER_24]: I will just note there are a lot of things that have been legal that have not been moral.

3150
04:27:30,576 --> 04:27:32,457
[SPEAKER_24]: in the history of this country and many other countries.

3151
04:27:32,537 --> 04:27:41,500
[SPEAKER_24]: And I will also note that I have multiple people very important to me who are naturalized citizens of this country who are very afraid of being deported because the president has said he's going to do it.

3152
04:27:42,101 --> 04:27:43,141
[SPEAKER_24]: Or the president-elect, sorry.

3153
04:27:43,441 --> 04:27:44,782
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank God for another four weeks.

3154
04:27:44,882 --> 04:27:50,444
[SPEAKER_24]: So yeah, I'm grateful that your experiences, that the people in your life who have that identity are not afraid.

3155
04:27:51,204 --> 04:28:05,515
[SPEAKER_24]: There are people very close to me who are citizens of this country, who were not born citizens of this country, who are deeply afraid that they will not be allowed to remain here because of the words and actions, promised actions of the person who's going to be taking the office of the president.

3156
04:28:05,995 --> 04:28:13,261
[SPEAKER_24]: So, yeah, I like that Medford's not going to do his bidding because I want people I love to stay here.

3157
04:28:13,601 --> 04:28:14,041
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

3158
04:28:14,662 --> 04:28:15,282
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you very much.

3159
04:28:15,302 --> 04:28:15,983
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll go to the podium.

3160
04:28:16,003 --> 04:28:16,863
[SPEAKER_24]: Name and address for the record, please.

3161
04:28:16,883 --> 04:28:17,484
[SPEAKER_24]: You have three minutes.

3162
04:28:18,328 --> 04:28:20,370
[SPEAKER_43]: Yes, it's Lisa Vienneau, 19 Paul Road.

3163
04:28:20,991 --> 04:28:23,174
[SPEAKER_43]: I want to agree with him that it's a slippery slope.

3164
04:28:23,354 --> 04:28:25,497
[SPEAKER_43]: I work in property management in Chelsea.

3165
04:28:25,797 --> 04:28:26,998
[SPEAKER_43]: It's a sanctuary city.

3166
04:28:27,439 --> 04:28:29,001
[SPEAKER_43]: All the documentation I get is

3167
04:28:31,417 --> 04:28:40,442
[SPEAKER_43]: I would say 60% to 70% illegal, which means the applicant's name on my application and all the pay stubs that I get do not match.

3168
04:28:40,923 --> 04:28:45,405
[SPEAKER_43]: Social security numbers names don't match to the applicant name.

3169
04:28:45,705 --> 04:28:49,968
[SPEAKER_43]: That's just one slippery slope that I'm on as a property manager.

3170
04:28:50,648 --> 04:28:54,931
[SPEAKER_43]: My apartments alluded, it's a two bedroom apartment.

3171
04:28:55,291 --> 04:28:56,311
[SPEAKER_43]: I've got at least 15 people.

3172
04:28:57,752 --> 04:28:59,033
[SPEAKER_43]: living in my apartments.

3173
04:28:59,973 --> 04:29:01,194
[SPEAKER_43]: MedFed has not seen that.

3174
04:29:01,414 --> 04:29:03,836
[SPEAKER_43]: MedFed has not seen what's happening.

3175
04:29:04,596 --> 04:29:13,261
[SPEAKER_43]: RAFT and all of the federal money that pays for their rent, because they're allowed to apply for federal money to get their first and last month's rent.

3176
04:29:13,661 --> 04:29:17,123
[SPEAKER_43]: But the rent they're after is their responsibility.

3177
04:29:17,343 --> 04:29:21,586
[SPEAKER_43]: And they have to come up with, you know, in MedFed, what is the going rate for an apartment?

3178
04:29:21,906 --> 04:29:23,507
[SPEAKER_43]: Approximately $2,000, maybe 1,500 for an apartment.

3179
04:29:26,485 --> 04:29:30,788
[SPEAKER_43]: Where are they getting that money to live in an apartment in Method?

3180
04:29:31,108 --> 04:29:32,289
[SPEAKER_43]: Where is that money coming from?

3181
04:29:32,689 --> 04:29:43,956
[SPEAKER_43]: That money has to come from somebody else's social security that allows them to use it so they can work in a job that then allows them to make some money so they can pay the rent.

3182
04:29:44,196 --> 04:29:44,637
[SPEAKER_43]: Think about it.

3183
04:29:44,937 --> 04:29:48,119
[SPEAKER_43]: Where is the money coming from for these undocumented people?

3184
04:29:48,579 --> 04:29:49,499
[SPEAKER_43]: Where is the money?

3185
04:29:50,220 --> 04:29:51,100
[SPEAKER_43]: Where is the job?

3186
04:29:51,140 --> 04:29:52,561
[SPEAKER_43]: They have no Social Security card.

3187
04:29:52,861 --> 04:29:53,701
[SPEAKER_43]: How can they work?

3188
04:29:54,142 --> 04:29:56,823
[SPEAKER_43]: They can't work legally in the United States.

3189
04:29:56,843 --> 04:29:57,923
[SPEAKER_43]: My parents were immigrants.

3190
04:29:58,103 --> 04:30:00,725
[SPEAKER_43]: I understand what it's like to have immigrants as parents.

3191
04:30:01,005 --> 04:30:02,826
[SPEAKER_43]: I am not against sanctuary cities.

3192
04:30:02,906 --> 04:30:03,326
[SPEAKER_43]: I am not.

3193
04:30:03,686 --> 04:30:09,232
[SPEAKER_43]: But it is a slippery slope that the landlords are not going to be able to deal with coming.

3194
04:30:09,612 --> 04:30:17,580
[SPEAKER_43]: If you allow everybody to just come in here and think that they can live in our apartments, I'm not saying that everyone's like this, I'm not.

3195
04:30:17,880 --> 04:30:21,204
[SPEAKER_43]: It's just that that's what I look at daily, and when we go to court.

3196
04:30:22,216 --> 04:30:23,797
[SPEAKER_43]: The courts are not on my side.

3197
04:30:24,557 --> 04:30:25,818
[SPEAKER_43]: This is Massachusetts.

3198
04:30:25,958 --> 04:30:27,439
[SPEAKER_43]: The court's on the tenant's side.

3199
04:30:28,059 --> 04:30:29,960
[SPEAKER_43]: So I lose again in court.

3200
04:30:30,440 --> 04:30:32,761
[SPEAKER_43]: So just so you know, it is a very slippery slope.

3201
04:30:33,301 --> 04:30:37,043
[SPEAKER_43]: And that is just with property management and real estate.

3202
04:30:37,163 --> 04:30:38,984
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm just talking about that right now.

3203
04:30:40,205 --> 04:30:42,186
[SPEAKER_43]: In school, I'm sure the kids are going to be OK.

3204
04:30:43,867 --> 04:30:45,529
[SPEAKER_43]: In other ways, probably they'll be okay.

3205
04:30:45,950 --> 04:30:49,374
[SPEAKER_43]: I agree, the police will probably not be problematic.

3206
04:30:49,394 --> 04:30:52,979
[SPEAKER_43]: I don't see that in Chelsea at all, that the police are problematic with the population.

3207
04:30:53,400 --> 04:30:54,942
[SPEAKER_43]: Nor are the teachers problematic.

3208
04:30:55,583 --> 04:30:58,246
[SPEAKER_43]: The problem is, where is the money coming from?

3209
04:30:59,868 --> 04:31:01,008
[SPEAKER_43]: They're illegal.

3210
04:31:01,028 --> 04:31:04,849
[SPEAKER_43]: They're using all fake documents, all fake documents.

3211
04:31:05,469 --> 04:31:08,450
[SPEAKER_43]: I just want to let you know that it's not as clean as you think it's going to be.

3212
04:31:08,730 --> 04:31:11,390
[SPEAKER_43]: It's a great, great thing to be a sanctuary.

3213
04:31:11,450 --> 04:31:12,430
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm not saying it isn't.

3214
04:31:12,990 --> 04:31:14,971
[SPEAKER_43]: It's just not as clean as you think it's going to be.

3215
04:31:15,371 --> 04:31:15,831
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

3216
04:31:17,731 --> 04:31:20,132
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sure they'd love to use real documents if they could.

3217
04:31:22,192 --> 04:31:25,272
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sure that they would love to be using real documents if they were legally allowed to.

3218
04:31:25,733 --> 04:31:27,393
[SPEAKER_24]: I'll go to Councilor Collins.

3219
04:31:27,593 --> 04:31:28,013
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

3220
04:31:30,697 --> 04:31:45,632
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Bears genuinely appreciate all the discussion around this item I'm glad that we're putting in the work to get this done this month I think this really is urgent I'm really proud of us for doing the hard work to move this from policy to an ordinance.

3221
04:31:46,572 --> 04:31:48,833
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, I'd like to move the question.

3222
04:31:48,853 --> 04:31:55,195
[SPEAKER_18]: I also did just want to note just just again for the record that undocumented immigrants like do have tax ID numbers.

3223
04:31:55,816 --> 04:32:00,317
[SPEAKER_18]: So, um, you know, that's just wanted to correct the record on that.

3224
04:32:00,798 --> 04:32:01,058
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

3225
04:32:01,098 --> 04:32:01,718
[SPEAKER_18]: I move the question.

3226
04:32:02,558 --> 04:32:03,459
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

3227
04:32:07,180 --> 04:32:09,201
[SPEAKER_24]: Thanks, and we will, but I'm going to say something first.

3228
04:32:10,081 --> 04:32:15,303
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, something I've been sitting with up here for a couple hours that I've just want to voice

3229
04:32:18,630 --> 04:32:27,994
[SPEAKER_24]: When we talk about dehumanizing rhetoric, when we talk about a dehumanizing politics that is infecting civil discourse at all levels, we experience that here.

3230
04:32:28,995 --> 04:32:33,437
[SPEAKER_24]: I really don't mean to personalize this, but this ordinance is one thing.

3231
04:32:33,457 --> 04:32:35,118
[SPEAKER_24]: We're talking about a surveillance ordinance in a minute.

3232
04:32:35,698 --> 04:32:39,000
[SPEAKER_24]: I just want to say that a member of the community tonight wrote about me in a public forum.

3233
04:32:39,600 --> 04:32:41,501
[SPEAKER_24]: If Zach turned up dead, I would not mind it.

3234
04:32:42,952 --> 04:32:44,354
[SPEAKER_24]: So that was written about me tonight.

3235
04:32:45,596 --> 04:32:57,452
[SPEAKER_24]: And I'm just raising that point, it's not really exactly relevant to the core principles of this ordinance, but it is relevant to the idea of a welcoming city and about just horrifically dehumanizing rhetoric that is

3236
04:32:59,244 --> 04:33:00,545
[SPEAKER_24]: pervading civil discourse.

3237
04:33:00,665 --> 04:33:17,535
[SPEAKER_24]: So when we talk about maybe not disrupting a public meeting and following the rules and listening to the rules of the chair and making sure that people feel safe to talk to their government officials, whether that's police or city councilors or anybody else, it is a local issue.

3238
04:33:18,836 --> 04:33:22,378
[SPEAKER_24]: And so I've stood here for two hours after having had to read that.

3239
04:33:22,438 --> 04:33:24,900
[SPEAKER_24]: And I just felt like, quite frankly, people

3240
04:33:25,967 --> 04:33:30,548
[SPEAKER_24]: deserve to know that this isn't just about a police policy and putting it into law.

3241
04:33:31,969 --> 04:33:41,091
[SPEAKER_24]: It's about some really harmful things that are happening in this community, some really harmful approaches and words and actions that are being brought to the forefront of a politics that I don't think any of us benefit from.

3242
04:33:41,311 --> 04:33:43,412
[SPEAKER_24]: So when we talk about division, that's what's dividing us.

3243
04:33:43,692 --> 04:33:44,052
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

3244
04:33:44,832 --> 04:33:51,494
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion of Councilor Collins to adopt this ordinance for first reading as amended, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

3245
04:33:52,334 --> 04:33:53,315
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

3246
04:33:55,319 --> 04:33:59,461
[SPEAKER_36]: Vice President Collins, Councilor Lazzaro, Councilor Leming.

3247
04:33:59,921 --> 04:34:00,221
[SPEAKER_33]: Yes.

3248
04:34:01,341 --> 04:34:05,723
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Tseng, President Bears.

3249
04:34:06,903 --> 04:34:08,324
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, six in affirmative, one in the negative.

3250
04:34:08,344 --> 04:34:18,848
[SPEAKER_24]: The motion passes and the ordinance is moved for first reading.

3251
04:34:18,868 --> 04:34:18,848
24502.

3252
04:34:20,308 --> 04:34:21,869
[SPEAKER_24]: Offered by Vice President Collins.

3253
04:34:21,909 --> 04:34:24,310
[SPEAKER_24]: Amendments to the Community Control of Republic Surveillance Ordinance.

3254
04:34:25,779 --> 04:34:26,734
[SPEAKER_24]: Vice President Collins.

3255
04:34:28,629 --> 04:34:30,010
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Bears.

3256
04:34:31,031 --> 04:34:38,698
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to try to keep this brief, but I do think that this project, like any other ordinance, benefits from just a teeny bit of exposition.

3257
04:34:39,739 --> 04:34:46,584
[SPEAKER_18]: So let me just orient these proposed amendments in the context of this ordinance and how long it's been on the books.

3258
04:34:47,845 --> 04:34:56,233
[SPEAKER_18]: These proposed amendments are tweaks to the Community Control over Public Surveillance Ordinance, which was passed by the City Council

3259
04:34:57,013 --> 04:35:04,077
[SPEAKER_18]: in March of 2023, and the amendments are proposed to make sure that the ordinance does a better job of reflecting its original intent.

3260
04:35:05,298 --> 04:35:08,580
[SPEAKER_18]: So this ordinance was worked on in City Council from 2022 to 2023.

3261
04:35:08,640 --> 04:35:09,300
[SPEAKER_18]: It was collaborated on

3262
04:35:12,962 --> 04:35:16,183
[SPEAKER_18]: by city councilors, residents, city staff.

3263
04:35:16,263 --> 04:35:21,404
[SPEAKER_18]: The police chief was present with us at many, many subcommittee meetings throughout the process of crafting us.

3264
04:35:22,785 --> 04:35:32,707
[SPEAKER_18]: We had sit downs in subcommittee with the mayor, chief of staff, and the chief of police was really grateful to them for putting so much time and conversation into this ordinance.

3265
04:35:32,927 --> 04:35:35,928
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not in a way, it's really simple.

3266
04:35:36,508 --> 04:35:46,437
[SPEAKER_18]: In another way, there was a lot to talk about, and I'm really grateful for them for doing that work with us over the course of months, which was predated by literally years of advocacy for such an ordinance by residents in the community.

3267
04:35:48,118 --> 04:35:51,121
[SPEAKER_18]: So what is the Community Control over Public Surveillance Ordinance?

3268
04:35:52,082 --> 04:35:54,364
[SPEAKER_18]: This is an ordinance that is in no way unique to Medford.

3269
04:35:54,884 --> 04:35:58,948
[SPEAKER_18]: They've been passed in many communities around Massachusetts and elsewhere throughout the country.

3270
04:36:00,749 --> 04:36:07,974
[SPEAKER_18]: They provide a way for local communities to have oversight over what surveillance technologies may be used by our municipal governments.

3271
04:36:08,455 --> 04:36:19,123
[SPEAKER_18]: They empower city councils and through the venue of the council, the public, to essentially ask the questions, why does the city want to use surveillance technology in our community?

3272
04:36:19,223 --> 04:36:20,964
[SPEAKER_18]: What problem is this supposed to solve?

3273
04:36:21,104 --> 04:36:22,025
[SPEAKER_18]: How will it solve it?

3274
04:36:22,065 --> 04:36:22,645
[SPEAKER_18]: How will it help?

3275
04:36:23,186 --> 04:36:24,307
[SPEAKER_18]: What are the potential risks?

3276
04:36:24,827 --> 04:36:25,547
[SPEAKER_18]: What are the costs?

3277
04:36:26,368 --> 04:36:35,475
[SPEAKER_18]: The City Council may then through the ordinance make a determination of whether the benefits outweigh the potential costs and whether to improve the technology or that use of surveillance data.

3278
04:36:36,816 --> 04:36:41,499
[SPEAKER_18]: Or not, or you know potentially condition it or put certain stipulations on it, etc.

3279
04:36:41,839 --> 04:36:48,144
[SPEAKER_18]: It creates a forum to have these discussions over this extremely new rapidly proliferating

3280
04:36:48,865 --> 04:37:05,364
[SPEAKER_18]: form of technology that has known, demonstrated, documented bad implications for civil liberties, for privacy, especially for marginalized populations, but not only for marginalized populations.

3281
04:37:08,107 --> 04:37:22,080
[SPEAKER_18]: creates a way for the community to have more of a listening ear and more of a voice in these conversations that often have to do with incredibly expensive things that cities are being lobbied to purchase from private corporations.

3282
04:37:23,381 --> 04:37:30,047
[SPEAKER_18]: A lot of these technologies are being very, very aggressively marketed to municipalities like ours by the corporations that develop them.

3283
04:37:30,928 --> 04:37:48,050
[SPEAKER_18]: And, you know, as one Councilor my goal with this ordinance is to make sure that in in one year and five year and 25 years, we're still spending public dollars on things that actually truly help Medford's public safety, more than they enrich the bottom lines of technology corporations.

3284
04:37:51,044 --> 04:37:59,067
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's, that's the briefest overview I can give, but if anybody wants to talk at length about surveillance technology and civil liberties with me hit me up.

3285
04:38:01,708 --> 04:38:08,850
[SPEAKER_18]: The amendments that we're putting forward tonight that we workshopped in community that came from suggestions, sorry, that we workshopped in committee.

3286
04:38:09,310 --> 04:38:11,392
[SPEAKER_18]: that came out of suggestions from the community.

3287
04:38:12,793 --> 04:38:16,856
[SPEAKER_18]: These are two amendments that just constitute two ways that we can further tighten up this ordinance.

3288
04:38:18,717 --> 04:38:27,263
[SPEAKER_18]: I also want to note just again for background, it's not at all unusual to return to a fairly recent ordinance or an old one and make amendments to it.

3289
04:38:27,323 --> 04:38:37,851
[SPEAKER_18]: We did this with our kind of technical zoning tweaks over the past couple years after we put forward some like technical amendments, we put them into use and that putting it into use alerted us to things that

3290
04:38:38,331 --> 04:38:40,314
[SPEAKER_18]: We're having unintended consequences.

3291
04:38:40,754 --> 04:38:45,400
[SPEAKER_18]: So we go back and you know now that we've like put it on the road a little bit we go back and fix it, tighten the screws.

3292
04:38:45,880 --> 04:38:52,448
[SPEAKER_18]: I see that as being part of this process, making amendments that help us to better embody the original intent of the ordinance.

3293
04:38:54,292 --> 04:39:04,256
[SPEAKER_18]: So there are two sections that I'm proposing changes to tonight that we worked on in public health and community safety committee that was circulated to Councilors.

3294
04:39:05,056 --> 04:39:13,960
[SPEAKER_18]: The proposed addition to section 5079, which covers enforcement, remedies, penalties, and whistleblower protections.

3295
04:39:15,000 --> 04:39:18,722
[SPEAKER_18]: That is to, that's additional language.

3296
04:39:21,226 --> 04:39:24,449
[SPEAKER_18]: That says, I read this all out of the committee meeting last week.

3297
04:39:24,849 --> 04:39:43,887
[SPEAKER_18]: To the extent permitted by law, including but not limited to, the requirements of the Massachusetts Public Records Law or the Municipal Records Retention Schedule, any video footage or other data recorded or obtained illegally or in violation of this ordinance shall be immediately destroyed and not introduced as evidence in any criminal or civil proceeding, except in those proceedings related to violations of this ordinance.

3298
04:39:44,708 --> 04:39:45,448
[SPEAKER_18]: What's the point of that?

3299
04:39:45,468 --> 04:39:46,549
[SPEAKER_24]: Vice President Collins.

3300
04:39:47,210 --> 04:40:03,244
[SPEAKER_24]: Would it be fair to say that to summarize these two amendments, the amendment to Section 5079 requires that any records kept by surveillance technologies that are not exempt, that are not required to be kept by the state or local law would not be kept?

3301
04:40:08,326 --> 04:40:11,430
[SPEAKER_18]: I think, yeah, I think that is comprised within it.

3302
04:40:11,530 --> 04:40:17,638
[SPEAKER_24]: And then 5080, that this is amending essentially that it was unlawful for the city.

3303
04:40:17,658 --> 04:40:18,780
[SPEAKER_18]: I can go faster, but I can.

3304
04:40:18,980 --> 04:40:19,681
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, thank you.

3305
04:40:21,243 --> 04:40:22,144
[SPEAKER_18]: So you can just say that.

3306
04:40:25,543 --> 04:40:28,265
[SPEAKER_18]: Section 59, there is an oversight in the original ordinance.

3307
04:40:29,305 --> 04:40:31,467
[SPEAKER_18]: It states how surveillance data can and cannot be used.

3308
04:40:31,487 --> 04:40:36,951
[SPEAKER_18]: It doesn't say what happens if we find ourselves having surveillance data that we oughtn't.

3309
04:40:37,531 --> 04:40:39,153
[SPEAKER_18]: This says it's got to be deleted.

3310
04:40:40,213 --> 04:40:44,897
[SPEAKER_18]: Similar to how if evidence is obtained without a warrant, it can't be used in a trial, the similar principle.

3311
04:40:46,518 --> 04:40:47,338
[SPEAKER_18]: In Section 5080, this covers

3312
04:40:50,999 --> 04:40:56,664
[SPEAKER_18]: uh, contracts that might result in surveillance data being generated elsewhere, being used by a municipality.

3313
04:40:57,525 --> 04:41:07,933
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, this is to remove an exception, um, that bulk commercially generated surveillance data may be used if it's in service of law enforcement.

3314
04:41:09,114 --> 04:41:15,100
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, it's, it's still being wrestled with by state and federal courts, um, if it's constitutional for this to happen at all.

3315
04:41:16,040 --> 04:41:22,762
[SPEAKER_18]: But by removing this exception, we're just making this section consistent with the intent of the rest of the ordinance.

3316
04:41:23,202 --> 04:41:24,782
[SPEAKER_18]: No carve-outs, just one process.

3317
04:41:25,282 --> 04:41:29,203
[SPEAKER_18]: If we're going to use surveillance tech or surveillance data, it's going to be subject to a public process.

3318
04:41:30,084 --> 04:41:35,705
[SPEAKER_18]: And I do have one really small tweak to make to the section in 5080 that is really just a semantic change.

3319
04:41:36,285 --> 04:41:38,446
[SPEAKER_18]: But I can, well, I'll just say it now.

3320
04:41:41,403 --> 04:41:44,844
[SPEAKER_18]: The change to 5080 would be to strike the word bulk.

3321
04:41:45,724 --> 04:41:48,205
[SPEAKER_18]: That appears bulk surveillance data.

3322
04:41:48,325 --> 04:41:49,105
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't need the word bulk.

3323
04:41:49,125 --> 04:41:49,845
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to strike that.

3324
04:41:50,665 --> 04:42:01,048
[SPEAKER_18]: And I would also add the phrase or any information derived from such data after the words surveillance data.

3325
04:42:01,068 --> 04:42:03,509
[SPEAKER_24]: Is that in the first sentence?

3326
04:42:03,729 --> 04:42:08,730
[SPEAKER_18]: In the first sentence and then in the last sentence, which is an addition.

3327
04:42:11,246 --> 04:42:15,210
[SPEAKER_24]: So could you send an amended version to the clerk, please?

3328
04:42:15,430 --> 04:42:15,790
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

3329
04:42:19,713 --> 04:42:21,915
[SPEAKER_24]: I think they're the same change in both sentences.

3330
04:42:21,955 --> 04:42:23,177
[SPEAKER_18]: Same change.

3331
04:42:23,377 --> 04:42:32,265
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just to clarify that we're talking about both surveillance data or any information that might be derived from such data.

3332
04:42:34,587 --> 04:42:38,410
[SPEAKER_18]: And I will email that to the clerk right now.

3333
04:42:40,300 --> 04:42:45,604
[SPEAKER_18]: I would motion to, after consideration by my fellow councillors, I would motion to approve for first reading.

3334
04:42:47,906 --> 04:42:48,166
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

3335
04:42:48,186 --> 04:42:53,190
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion of Councilor Collins to approve for first reading, seconded by Councilor Tseng, we'll go to Councilor Scarpelli.

3336
04:42:54,291 --> 04:42:54,731
[SPEAKER_24]: As amended.

3337
04:42:56,152 --> 04:42:57,093
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3338
04:42:57,253 --> 04:43:05,579
[SPEAKER_29]: If you recall, this process was very well vetted by the chief.

3339
04:43:06,560 --> 04:43:08,361
[SPEAKER_29]: And there were so many concerns that

3340
04:43:09,136 --> 04:43:10,777
[SPEAKER_29]: he talked about with public safety.

3341
04:43:11,917 --> 04:43:24,643
[SPEAKER_29]: And I know this was in subcommittee, and we're coming right to the floor with this and understanding that this is clearly politics over public safety.

3342
04:43:24,683 --> 04:43:25,483
[SPEAKER_29]: This is frightening.

3343
04:43:27,464 --> 04:43:29,845
[SPEAKER_29]: This is a process without having the chief involved.

3344
04:43:30,926 --> 04:43:36,188
[SPEAKER_29]: I think it's where you're stepping overbound, because I remember those days, he was heavily involved, Councilor.

3345
04:43:37,907 --> 04:43:46,913
[SPEAKER_29]: to hear that he wasn't part of this because these are some of the things he definitely talked about that helped him keep our residents safe and our community safe.

3346
04:43:47,554 --> 04:43:48,815
[SPEAKER_29]: I remember that specifically.

3347
04:43:49,936 --> 04:43:54,219
[SPEAKER_29]: And him not being here and us just pushing these through, I just think it's wrong right now.

3348
04:43:55,620 --> 04:44:01,304
[SPEAKER_29]: Again, I wish that you would table this to sit with the chief and have him review this to see the impacts.

3349
04:44:02,090 --> 04:44:03,371
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, we're seeing what's going on.

3350
04:44:03,391 --> 04:44:20,904
[SPEAKER_29]: I, you know, I've talked to neighboring communities and understanding that, you know, I understand the process and the understanding where, um, how it can affect people in a negative way, but the pros outweigh the cons in so many ways.

3351
04:44:20,925 --> 04:44:26,509
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, look how they look, look how they found the murder, the gentleman who killed the, uh,

3352
04:44:28,413 --> 04:44:29,094
[SPEAKER_29]: in New York City.

3353
04:44:29,414 --> 04:44:31,954
[SPEAKER_29]: It was all by surveillance camera, by following him around.

3354
04:44:32,754 --> 04:44:34,575
[SPEAKER_29]: They took a murder off the street that way.

3355
04:44:35,195 --> 04:44:44,338
[SPEAKER_29]: You're looking to put into action policies that take away that ability for our police and our community.

3356
04:44:45,178 --> 04:44:48,639
[SPEAKER_29]: I just think this is stepping over a line.

3357
04:44:48,679 --> 04:44:53,480
[SPEAKER_29]: This is something that, you know, we just don't do this at 12 o'clock at night.

3358
04:44:54,756 --> 04:45:07,052
[SPEAKER_29]: I know, but to do it at 12 o'clock at night and not have the process over just a subcommittee meeting where everybody wasn't privy to it and then come to here today and start moving these ordinances.

3359
04:45:09,187 --> 04:45:15,008
[SPEAKER_24]: Sure, and I would just note that the CCOPS ordinance exempts CCTV cameras on public buildings.

3360
04:45:15,189 --> 04:45:23,791
[SPEAKER_24]: It exempts the ability of our police department to receive data from private cameras, which is what most of the data was in the case that you mentioned.

3361
04:45:23,831 --> 04:45:25,751
[SPEAKER_24]: So it actually doesn't do any of that.

3362
04:45:25,911 --> 04:45:26,691
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Collins.

3363
04:45:28,292 --> 04:45:30,052
[SPEAKER_24]: You can't help it.

3364
04:45:32,493 --> 04:45:33,513
[SPEAKER_24]: Truth matters, George.

3365
04:45:33,573 --> 04:45:34,493
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry, George.

3366
04:45:34,953 --> 04:45:36,054
[SPEAKER_24]: But don't do what you're doing.

3367
04:45:36,074 --> 04:45:37,374
[SPEAKER_24]: It's just the truth.

3368
04:45:38,430 --> 04:45:39,753
[SPEAKER_24]: George, please stop.

3369
04:45:39,793 --> 04:45:40,876
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Collins has the floor.

3370
04:45:40,896 --> 04:45:42,199
[SPEAKER_24]: It's embarrassing.

3371
04:45:48,517 --> 04:45:50,658
[SPEAKER_18]: A couple points to clarify.

3372
04:45:50,678 --> 04:45:54,720
[SPEAKER_18]: One, I didn't state that the chief wasn't involved.

3373
04:45:54,941 --> 04:45:55,661
[SPEAKER_18]: I reached out to him.

3374
04:45:55,681 --> 04:45:56,762
[SPEAKER_18]: He didn't respond.

3375
04:45:58,262 --> 04:45:59,043
[SPEAKER_18]: I know he's a busy guy.

3376
04:46:00,544 --> 04:46:07,387
[SPEAKER_18]: We involved him every step of the way when the 99.9% of the ordinance that isn't changing was crafted between 2022 and 2023.

3377
04:46:09,328 --> 04:46:26,178
[SPEAKER_18]: And another thing that I do remember specifically from those months of meetings in the previous term was that the chief repeatedly emphasized that the city of Medford currently does not have a practice of purchasing surveillance data targeted or in bulk, and also has no plans to do so in the future.

3378
04:46:26,338 --> 04:46:35,363
[SPEAKER_18]: So this would have, unless that is no longer correct or wasn't correct at the time, this would have no impact on the work of public safety in our community.

3379
04:46:40,572 --> 04:46:45,074
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you on the motion of Councilor Collins to adopt for first reading, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

3380
04:46:45,634 --> 04:46:47,255
[SPEAKER_24]: Any further discussion by members of the Council?

3381
04:46:48,196 --> 04:46:49,877
[SPEAKER_24]: Seeing none, we'll go to public participation.

3382
04:46:49,897 --> 04:46:51,217
[SPEAKER_24]: Name and address for the record, please.

3383
04:46:51,237 --> 04:46:51,998
[SPEAKER_24]: You have three minutes.

3384
04:46:54,059 --> 04:46:56,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, Barry Ingber, 9 Draper Street, North Midford.

3385
04:46:57,780 --> 04:47:08,746
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to thank President Bears for joining us on this journey five years ago, and then to Vice President Collins for

3386
04:47:09,591 --> 04:47:15,314
[SPEAKER_05]: carrying the banner for God knows how long, for us.

3387
04:47:16,274 --> 04:47:33,722
[SPEAKER_05]: This CCOPS ordinance exists because city council and Medford residents have a shared concern and interest around civil liberties, public safety, privacy, transparency in government, and sound decision-making around major financial decisions.

3388
04:47:34,875 --> 04:47:43,841
[SPEAKER_05]: It reflects the widespread public opinion that the use of surveillance technology should be made public and the government should protect people's privacy.

3389
04:47:44,402 --> 04:47:50,066
[SPEAKER_05]: This ordinance doesn't outlaw any surveillance tools.

3390
04:47:50,506 --> 04:47:58,992
[SPEAKER_05]: It just says that city council and residents should be involved in the decision making around that acquisition and purchase.

3391
04:48:00,163 --> 04:48:14,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Members of Medford People Power spent over four years working on it in partnership with the ACLU, with the chief, and gaining the endorsement of a wide range of community organizations, institutions, and faith organizations.

3392
04:48:16,106 --> 04:48:29,649
[SPEAKER_05]: While the passage of the CCOPS ordinance in 2023 was a great victory for Medford residents, a loophole remains regarding the city's potential purchase of commercially available surveillance data.

3393
04:48:30,458 --> 04:48:40,185
[SPEAKER_05]: This type of contract potentially threatens both public accountability and civil liberties and threatens to undermine the entire purpose of the ordinance.

3394
04:48:40,766 --> 04:48:54,876
[SPEAKER_05]: We strongly encourage the city council to restore the original language of section 5080 that included the Medford Police Department along with all other city departments as prohibited from surveillance data purchases or exchanges.

3395
04:48:55,711 --> 04:49:07,257
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to make sure that our dollars are being spent going towards true public safety, not on expensive gadgets and software that enriches corporations more than they actually help us.

3396
04:49:09,479 --> 04:49:10,059
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

3397
04:49:14,581 --> 04:49:16,182
[SPEAKER_24]: Go to the podium, name and address for the record, please.

3398
04:49:16,202 --> 04:49:16,923
[SPEAKER_24]: You have three minutes.

3399
04:49:16,943 --> 04:49:19,084
[SPEAKER_24]: And if you'd like to speak in your own Zoom, please raise your hand.

3400
04:49:20,933 --> 04:49:21,253
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

3401
04:49:21,513 --> 04:49:24,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Paulette Bardabedian, 27 Central Ave, Medford.

3402
04:49:25,414 --> 04:49:41,239
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to say that I agree with Councilor Scarpelli that we all have said many times, I'm so tired, I'm so tired, it's so late, that this doesn't, this ordinance that we're dealing with now doesn't seem like it has to be pushed through tonight.

3403
04:49:41,599 --> 04:49:43,480
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that really should take some time.

3404
04:49:43,860 --> 04:49:46,341
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand it's been going on for years,

3405
04:49:46,701 --> 04:49:48,184
[SPEAKER_03]: but there have been changes in it.

3406
04:49:48,645 --> 04:49:56,138
[SPEAKER_03]: And to not be able to use some surveillance cameras or have them there, I feel it's really

3407
04:49:57,378 --> 04:49:58,839
[SPEAKER_03]: against public safety.

3408
04:49:59,439 --> 04:50:05,562
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree with with Councilor Scarpelli, the cameras got a murderer.

3409
04:50:05,882 --> 04:50:07,783
[SPEAKER_03]: If something's, I watch court TV.

3410
04:50:07,883 --> 04:50:10,865
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not talking about your Judge Judy and those things.

3411
04:50:10,925 --> 04:50:14,207
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking about real court cases live.

3412
04:50:14,767 --> 04:50:16,528
[SPEAKER_03]: I watch it like every single day.

3413
04:50:17,348 --> 04:50:18,569
[SPEAKER_03]: And so much is

3414
04:50:20,316 --> 04:50:22,758
[SPEAKER_03]: solved by surveillance cameras.

3415
04:50:23,038 --> 04:50:39,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I don't want someone watching me like, you know, walking down the street, talking to myself or whatever, but it's very important to have these things and to say we have this, but we can't use it in a criminal case is, I'm afraid for my safety.

3416
04:50:39,410 --> 04:50:41,712
[SPEAKER_03]: It has nothing to do with, um,

3417
04:50:42,557 --> 04:50:44,037
[SPEAKER_03]: dignity or things like that.

3418
04:50:44,238 --> 04:50:46,278
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, it's common sense.

3419
04:50:47,138 --> 04:50:51,260
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't get it how we're pushing through all these things, quick, quick, quick, quick.

3420
04:50:52,740 --> 04:50:56,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there any public input into your decisions?

3421
04:50:56,101 --> 04:50:58,862
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, I feel like it's almost none now.

3422
04:50:58,882 --> 04:51:01,383
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I've been in residence for Medford my whole life.

3423
04:51:01,723 --> 04:51:02,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, my family.

3424
04:51:02,563 --> 04:51:07,405
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, I know, but you're not the only one.

3425
04:51:07,865 --> 04:51:09,145
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not the only one.

3426
04:51:09,485 --> 04:51:11,626
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't, I just feel it's just,

3427
04:51:13,526 --> 04:51:14,467
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

3428
04:51:14,567 --> 04:51:17,449
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just very disturbing to me to hear this.

3429
04:51:17,969 --> 04:51:25,754
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, maybe the previous ordinance you wanted to get through, but this one, I don't think it needs to be pushed through tonight.

3430
04:51:25,794 --> 04:51:28,235
[SPEAKER_03]: It can be postponed till the next meeting.

3431
04:51:28,516 --> 04:51:32,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Give people a chance to talk and see what they think about it.

3432
04:51:32,878 --> 04:51:34,599
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have to just say this too.

3433
04:51:36,827 --> 04:51:46,510
[SPEAKER_03]: I like living in this part of the country because of diversity of everything, whether it's religion or ethnicity, language, I love it.

3434
04:51:46,670 --> 04:51:51,371
[SPEAKER_03]: I could never live in what my term is, a white bread place.

3435
04:51:51,791 --> 04:52:05,255
[SPEAKER_03]: I want all this diversity, but to have someone come in and speak their opinion about religion and politics, our country is founded on a separation of church and state, and it should remain that way.

3436
04:52:05,595 --> 04:52:05,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

3437
04:52:06,391 --> 04:52:06,811
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

3438
04:52:07,212 --> 04:52:17,919
[SPEAKER_24]: Paulette, I hope I can allay some of your concerns just to say this does not ban surveillance cameras, does not ban the police from asking private businesses that have surveillance cameras to provide that information to them.

3439
04:52:18,719 --> 04:52:21,861
[SPEAKER_24]: It does not ban the city from having surveillance cameras for a number of purposes.

3440
04:52:23,142 --> 04:52:30,867
[SPEAKER_24]: And this ordinance is an amendment to an ordinance that already exists and has existed for over a year and has not impacted criminal enforcement and cases in the city.

3441
04:52:31,308 --> 04:52:33,229
[SPEAKER_24]: So I hope that allays some of the fears that you just raised.

3442
04:52:34,790 --> 04:52:39,313
[SPEAKER_24]: for, you know, when information goes out there, sometimes it can be interpreted in different ways.

3443
04:52:39,353 --> 04:52:55,524
[SPEAKER_24]: I just want to tell you all of these two paragraphs are amending is about the city being able to go and buy everybody's data from Amazon and then use that for some purpose other than, you know, I don't even know what purpose, but essentially going to a company and buying everything that the Internet knows about you.

3444
04:52:56,406 --> 04:52:58,467
[SPEAKER_24]: and then using that to try to control your life.

3445
04:52:59,148 --> 04:53:00,288
[SPEAKER_24]: That's what this is about tonight.

3446
04:53:00,688 --> 04:53:01,129
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

3447
04:53:01,689 --> 04:53:03,090
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not about surveillance cameras.

3448
04:53:03,170 --> 04:53:09,593
[SPEAKER_24]: If you read the existing surveillance ordinance that's in place, it exempts CCTV cameras that protect public property.

3449
04:53:10,294 --> 04:53:18,678
[SPEAKER_24]: It doesn't mean that private businesses can't have their surveillance cameras like the hostile in the case recently that the mask down.

3450
04:53:18,758 --> 04:53:19,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

3451
04:53:19,479 --> 04:53:20,539
[SPEAKER_24]: It doesn't do anything like that.

3452
04:53:20,659 --> 04:53:21,720
[SPEAKER_24]: So that's not what this does.

3453
04:53:21,740 --> 04:53:23,201
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't want you to be afraid.

3454
04:53:24,541 --> 04:53:25,462
[SPEAKER_24]: This ordinance is about

3455
04:53:25,822 --> 04:53:36,351
[SPEAKER_24]: the government and its access to information about its residents and not abusing residents by buying information in bulk to try to use that for some purpose.

3456
04:53:37,112 --> 04:53:38,473
[SPEAKER_24]: Who knows what purpose they might use it for.

3457
04:53:38,733 --> 04:53:39,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

3458
04:53:39,173 --> 04:53:40,314
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for clarifying that.

3459
04:53:40,354 --> 04:53:40,715
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

3460
04:53:42,556 --> 04:53:43,317
[SPEAKER_24]: Stay at the podium.

3461
04:53:43,657 --> 04:53:44,758
[SPEAKER_24]: Name and address for the record, please.

3462
04:53:44,778 --> 04:53:45,499
[SPEAKER_24]: You have three minutes.

3463
04:53:45,879 --> 04:53:47,900
[SPEAKER_39]: Hi, Anna Meyer, 6 Douglas Road.

3464
04:53:47,920 --> 04:53:58,985
[SPEAKER_39]: I just wanted to share briefly that I think that taking a stance to close any gaps on the COPS ordinance actually does a lot to reinforce Medford's stance as a welcoming city as we just passed.

3465
04:53:59,605 --> 04:54:05,868
[SPEAKER_39]: And I think it's really important to do this in response to some of the actions of the Boston City Council last week that just passed

3466
04:54:06,408 --> 04:54:22,914
[SPEAKER_39]: millions of dollars that will go to the Boston Regional Intelligence Center that will affect so many of our neighboring communities, including like Everett and Cambridge and Somerville that actually does a lot to like increase its funding of surveillance, which can then be sent to immigration enforcement, including ICE.

3467
04:54:22,934 --> 04:54:31,317
[SPEAKER_39]: I don't know that's not specifically what we're discussing, but I just really appreciate that Medford is taking so seriously the use of surveillance data to protect its citizens from that.

3468
04:54:31,397 --> 04:54:33,678
[SPEAKER_39]: And so just thank you for introducing us tonight.

3469
04:54:34,118 --> 04:54:34,478
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

3470
04:54:35,493 --> 04:54:36,513
[SPEAKER_24]: Name and address for the record, please.

3471
04:54:36,533 --> 04:54:37,194
[SPEAKER_24]: You have three minutes.

3472
04:54:37,854 --> 04:54:39,755
[SPEAKER_21]: Josh Eckert-Lee, 347 Main Street.

3473
04:54:40,075 --> 04:54:42,416
[SPEAKER_21]: I want to echo Anna and Barry's words.

3474
04:54:42,536 --> 04:54:45,557
[SPEAKER_21]: I am grateful for this update, Vice President Collins.

3475
04:54:45,817 --> 04:54:47,937
[SPEAKER_21]: I thank you for your work and your words.

3476
04:54:48,618 --> 04:54:57,241
[SPEAKER_21]: As an immigrant and a naturalized citizen, I'm grateful for your vote also earlier this evening and want to say as a municipal employee, I know how

3477
04:54:58,782 --> 04:55:14,594
[SPEAKER_21]: limited our cybersecurity training is as public employees, and our ability to be a vector for getting this private security sort of data out to hackers by being a kind of weak point is super real.

3478
04:55:14,634 --> 04:55:18,397
[SPEAKER_21]: So minimizing that risk is super important, and I'm grateful for the closing of that loophole.

3479
04:55:18,417 --> 04:55:18,978
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

3480
04:55:20,719 --> 04:55:21,140
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

3481
04:55:21,360 --> 04:55:23,021
[SPEAKER_24]: Any further discussion by members of the public?

3482
04:55:24,382 --> 04:55:26,464
[SPEAKER_24]: Seeing none, is there any further discussion by members of the Council?

3483
04:55:28,382 --> 04:55:34,626
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion of Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Tseng to approve these amendments to the CCOPS ordinance for first reading.

3484
04:55:35,447 --> 04:55:36,067
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Clerk, please.

3485
04:55:36,127 --> 04:55:36,407
[SPEAKER_24]: As amended.

3486
04:55:36,548 --> 04:55:37,068
[SPEAKER_24]: As amended.

3487
04:55:37,688 --> 04:55:39,049
[SPEAKER_24]: Please call the roll, Mr. Clerk.

3488
04:55:40,650 --> 04:55:41,251
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Callahan.

3489
04:55:43,592 --> 04:55:44,453
[SPEAKER_36]: Vice President Collins.

3490
04:55:45,794 --> 04:55:46,674
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Lazzaro.

3491
04:55:47,875 --> 04:55:48,416
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Leming.

3492
04:55:48,916 --> 04:55:49,216
[SPEAKER_35]: Yes.

3493
04:55:50,477 --> 04:55:51,157
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Scarpelli.

3494
04:55:51,177 --> 04:55:51,258
[SPEAKER_36]: No.

3495
04:55:52,819 --> 04:55:53,379
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Tseng.

3496
04:55:54,240 --> 04:55:54,800
[SPEAKER_36]: President Bears.

3497
04:55:55,865 --> 04:55:56,586
[SPEAKER_24]: Absolutely.

3498
04:55:57,026 --> 04:55:59,088
[SPEAKER_24]: Six in the affirmative, one in the negative, the motion passes.

3499
04:56:06,554 --> 04:56:09,977
[SPEAKER_24]: So that brings us, I believe, a reversion to the regular order of business.

3500
04:56:10,037 --> 04:56:11,319
[SPEAKER_24]: There's two items left.

3501
04:56:13,120 --> 04:56:16,543
[SPEAKER_24]: We have whatever is left of the regular order of business, I guess I could say.

3502
04:56:18,785 --> 04:56:20,687
[SPEAKER_24]: We have mine, which I can't find right now.

3503
04:56:23,780 --> 04:56:30,755
[SPEAKER_24]: And I'm going to turn this over to Councilor Collins to read and control.

3504
04:56:30,775 --> 04:56:33,000
[SPEAKER_24]: If you could leave your copy down there, you can use my copy up here.

3505
04:56:51,256 --> 04:56:58,021
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, paper 24513 offered by President Barrett's resolution to request changes to propose Tufts Dormitory Project.

3506
04:56:58,862 --> 04:57:07,529
[SPEAKER_18]: Whereas Tufts University has proposed a new dormitory project at 401 Boston Ave, and whereas the City Council strongly supports legislative efforts to pass fairer state laws

3507
04:57:08,149 --> 04:57:36,261
[SPEAKER_18]: to encourage collaboration and partnership between large nonprofit institutions like Tufts and municipalities like Medford, and whereas the City Council also strongly supports the goal and intent of providing significant additional on-campus housing by Tufts, and whereas the City Council thanks area residents for voicing their concerns and attempting to have more robust and collaborative public input on the Tufts dormitory proposal, and whereas the City Council does not have a decision-making role regarding this project,

3508
04:57:36,881 --> 04:57:53,470
[SPEAKER_18]: Now therefore be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we request that Tufts University use an alternative site plan or add another site to the project to reduce height and impact of shadows on the surrounding neighborhood while also increasing the tree canopy and adding additional streetscape improvements to their project.

3509
04:57:54,537 --> 04:58:15,393
[SPEAKER_18]: be it further resolved that we request that Tufts University drop opposition to and or state their support for state legislation to implement the Institutional Master Plan Home Rule petitions proposed for nearly a decade by the cities of Medford and Somerville and state legislation to create a mandatory pilot payment in lieu of taxes law for large educational and medical nonprofit institutions.

3510
04:58:16,074 --> 04:58:24,020
[SPEAKER_18]: Be it further resolved that we thank the Community Development Board and our city staff team for their work as this proposal moves through the public process.

3511
04:58:25,250 --> 04:58:25,751
[SPEAKER_18]: President Barras.

3512
04:58:34,042 --> 04:58:39,208
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Vice President Collins, for your presentation.

3513
04:58:39,389 --> 04:58:40,570
[SPEAKER_24]: I think it really speaks to

3514
04:58:42,256 --> 04:58:45,057
[SPEAKER_24]: all of the issues, or at least some of the issues around 401 Boston Avenue.

3515
04:58:45,097 --> 04:58:48,099
[SPEAKER_24]: I do know we have a number of residents still on Zoom who wanted to speak to this.

3516
04:58:49,220 --> 04:58:51,881
[SPEAKER_24]: I just want to note that tomorrow night is the Community Development Board.

3517
04:58:51,901 --> 04:58:58,124
[SPEAKER_24]: The Community Development Board is the authority that is reviewing this application.

3518
04:59:00,025 --> 04:59:01,986
[SPEAKER_24]: And I just wanted to also note a couple of things here.

3519
04:59:02,006 --> 04:59:02,406
[SPEAKER_24]: To me,

3520
04:59:05,262 --> 04:59:10,745
[SPEAKER_24]: I am grateful that Tufts is taking on this responsibility to add housing on its campus.

3521
04:59:10,785 --> 04:59:13,687
[SPEAKER_24]: That is something that this community has wanted Tufts to do for a long time.

3522
04:59:15,408 --> 04:59:24,133
[SPEAKER_24]: But every project that Tufts does falls under a greater scope of the balance of power between municipalities and large educational nonprofits.

3523
04:59:24,653 --> 04:59:27,215
[SPEAKER_24]: That is way out of whack when it comes to our state laws.

3524
04:59:27,855 --> 04:59:29,456
[SPEAKER_24]: When it comes to our state laws around

3525
04:59:31,697 --> 04:59:38,900
[SPEAKER_24]: site plan, Dover amendment, and what these institutions have to do to collaborate with municipalities and their neighbors.

3526
04:59:39,580 --> 04:59:50,945
[SPEAKER_24]: When it comes to the pilot legislation, payments in lieu of taxes and the, you know, five years ago we analyzed the Tufts on its non-taxable property would be paying $8 million.

3527
04:59:52,145 --> 04:59:53,947
[SPEAKER_24]: and it is paying $500,000.

3528
04:59:55,828 --> 05:00:05,616
[SPEAKER_24]: It's a huge loss for us when it comes to the city services that we need to provide, and the city services that institutions like that consume, both on campus and off campus.

3529
05:00:05,676 --> 05:00:14,103
[SPEAKER_24]: So this really does fit into this larger question, which is why a big piece of this resolution is about the state legislation that this body has supported.

3530
05:00:14,663 --> 05:00:36,192
[SPEAKER_24]: both the home rule petitions around institutional master plans that we have submitted along with our neighbors in Somerville to ask Tufts and require Tufts to provide a master plan for their growth and development so that we can be aware of that and inform our community about that, as well as the pilot legislation to require a 25% pilot versus the completely voluntary system we have now.

3531
05:00:37,105 --> 05:00:47,773
[SPEAKER_24]: One reason I bring up the institutional master plan is that around this Tufts proposal, you know, couple of years ago we had Tufts initially doing the storm proposal at around seven stories and 400 beds.

3532
05:00:48,754 --> 05:00:56,139
[SPEAKER_24]: It's now 10 stories and 700 beds and I am actually a fan of more beds I think Tufts taking on more responsibility for on campus housing is a good thing.

3533
05:00:56,900 --> 05:01:12,213
[SPEAKER_24]: But I can understand how residents feel that the maybe the scope of the site plan and the height of the building and the shadows are a major issue, or even residents who just feel that the process itself, where it was seven stories now it's 10 stories, how do we get there.

3534
05:01:13,635 --> 05:01:19,260
[SPEAKER_24]: And what what's the city's role in trying to mitigate and mediate and collaborate and negotiate in that process.

3535
05:01:21,331 --> 05:01:23,033
[SPEAKER_24]: City doesn't really seem to have much leverage.

3536
05:01:23,854 --> 05:01:30,821
[SPEAKER_24]: So I really just respect the residents in the area who have advocated for changes to this project.

3537
05:01:31,042 --> 05:01:34,245
[SPEAKER_24]: I want to put ourselves on record as supporting those efforts.

3538
05:01:35,827 --> 05:01:40,652
[SPEAKER_24]: I also did speak to the mayor earlier today about this issue.

3539
05:01:40,672 --> 05:01:40,732
[SPEAKER_24]: She

3540
05:01:41,813 --> 05:02:02,812
[SPEAKER_24]: and noted that she had sent a letter and that she supports our efforts and advocacy around this issue, but also that she has had some good conversations with Tufts and is hopeful for an outcome that has more mitigation, more community benefits than the initial Tufts proposal of three or four months ago.

3541
05:02:04,154 --> 05:02:06,135
[SPEAKER_24]: That process is ongoing in the Community Development Board.

3542
05:02:06,155 --> 05:02:14,883
[SPEAKER_24]: I also spoke with Rocco DiRico from Tufts, and I do have want to just read an email that he sent over.

3543
05:02:17,475 --> 05:02:25,885
[SPEAKER_24]: This is to the Honorable President, Zach Bears, Medford City Council regarding Resolution 24-513 to request changes to the proposed Tufts Dormitory project.

3544
05:02:26,746 --> 05:02:30,149
[SPEAKER_24]: Dear President Bears, I ask that the following statement be read at tonight's City Council meeting.

3545
05:02:30,610 --> 05:02:35,295
[SPEAKER_24]: Tufts University is proposing a new residence hall to be operated by Capstone Management on Boston Avenue.

3546
05:02:35,896 --> 05:02:40,321
[SPEAKER_24]: The proposed project is part of an ongoing effort that meets many of the city's and the university's shared goals.

3547
05:02:40,882 --> 05:02:48,170
[SPEAKER_24]: More on campus housing, mixed use development, density near public transit, and an energy efficient building design that meets the city's specialized stretch energy code.

3548
05:02:48,790 --> 05:02:52,755
[SPEAKER_24]: The university has spent the last four months meeting with neighbors, government officials, the Community Development Board,

3549
05:02:53,255 --> 05:02:54,135
[SPEAKER_24]: and other stakeholders.

3550
05:02:54,716 --> 05:02:57,837
[SPEAKER_24]: As a result of those meetings, we have added several community benefits to the project.

3551
05:02:58,057 --> 05:03:04,759
[SPEAKER_24]: Those improvements include new sidewalks on both sides of Boston Avenue, new crosswalks, new trees, new retail options, and a blue bike station.

3552
05:03:05,319 --> 05:03:08,541
[SPEAKER_24]: All these improvements will make Boston Avenue greener, more walkable, and more accessible.

3553
05:03:09,101 --> 05:03:11,502
[SPEAKER_24]: Tufts University has hosted three community meetings on this project.

3554
05:03:12,042 --> 05:03:15,603
[SPEAKER_24]: At these meetings, we listened to our neighbors, acknowledged their concerns, and acted upon feedback.

3555
05:03:16,123 --> 05:03:20,525
[SPEAKER_24]: The university has also agreed to a $500,000 one-time payment to create a neighborhood improvement fund

3556
05:03:21,025 --> 05:03:22,706
[SPEAKER_24]: for the neighborhood impacted by the project.

3557
05:03:23,207 --> 05:03:26,789
[SPEAKER_24]: We look forward to working with the neighbors and the city to determine the best way to utilize these funds.

3558
05:03:27,349 --> 05:03:31,312
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you for the city's partnership with Tufts University on this project and many other initiatives.

3559
05:03:31,372 --> 05:03:36,415
[SPEAKER_24]: The university remains committed to building more housing, revitalizing Boston Avenue, and improving accessibility.

3560
05:03:36,895 --> 05:03:39,677
[SPEAKER_24]: This project will have a positive impact on the city and the university.

3561
05:03:40,137 --> 05:03:44,280
[SPEAKER_24]: Sincerely, Rocco DiRico, Executive Director of Government and Community Relations, Tufts University.

3562
05:03:45,131 --> 05:03:46,252
[SPEAKER_24]: So I wanted to read that to note.

3563
05:03:47,552 --> 05:03:49,133
[SPEAKER_24]: That is the position of Tufts University.

3564
05:03:51,035 --> 05:04:00,880
[SPEAKER_24]: And Rocco and I have disagreed on many issues over the years, and we are able to have amicable discussions based on the positions that we both hold.

3565
05:04:02,361 --> 05:04:10,526
[SPEAKER_24]: And I just say that because, again, commenting on civil discourse, I think, and what that means and how the truth plays a part in it.

3566
05:04:12,387 --> 05:04:14,749
[SPEAKER_24]: And I also just want to say I have some honest disagreements.

3567
05:04:15,134 --> 05:04:18,639
[SPEAKER_24]: with Rocco, especially when it comes to

3568
05:04:20,450 --> 05:04:26,792
[SPEAKER_24]: what is the responsibility of these large educational nonprofit institutions to the municipalities, the cities, and the towns that they call home.

3569
05:04:27,313 --> 05:04:30,334
[SPEAKER_24]: And I don't think state law reflects what the best arrangement of that should look like.

3570
05:04:30,814 --> 05:04:46,120
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think until we have changes there and until Tufts and cities like Benford are able to work together as partners to rebalance that relationship, it's going to poison processes, community processes around construction, around pilot, around expansion, around

3571
05:04:46,640 --> 05:04:51,324
[SPEAKER_24]: what these institutions mean to the communities that they call home.

3572
05:04:51,684 --> 05:04:53,565
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think that's what's happened here.

3573
05:04:54,306 --> 05:04:56,328
[SPEAKER_24]: I think there's a lot of good that can come out of this project.

3574
05:04:58,289 --> 05:05:06,956
[SPEAKER_24]: I think there's some things that could change, and I would hope would change, and there's some things that maybe just can't change, and that's going to be really difficult to deal with.

3575
05:05:09,421 --> 05:05:20,387
[SPEAKER_24]: I know that a lot of folks don't feel heard in the process, even, even with everything that Rocco said, people don't feel heard and people feel like Tufts just has so much power that it feels like a bully institution.

3576
05:05:21,507 --> 05:05:22,568
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's really difficult.

3577
05:05:22,928 --> 05:05:26,130
[SPEAKER_24]: And I don't think Tufts wants to be seen as that I don't think they want to act like that.

3578
05:05:26,730 --> 05:05:42,042
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think because, sadly, everyone in our society seems married to the idea that we just have to do whatever the law requires and nothing more, because the law is so imbalanced in Tufts' favor, they may not even realize how they're appearing and presenting to the community.

3579
05:05:43,524 --> 05:05:46,746
[SPEAKER_24]: So I really hope we can see some systemic change here.

3580
05:05:46,786 --> 05:05:52,231
[SPEAKER_24]: I think this project is sitting in that larger context.

3581
05:05:53,071 --> 05:05:55,914
[SPEAKER_24]: But I do hope that our Community Development Board can work

3582
05:05:56,454 --> 05:06:02,481
[SPEAKER_24]: to get to a project approval that also reflects as much mitigation as possible.

3583
05:06:03,202 --> 05:06:09,829
[SPEAKER_24]: And that in some ways, this resolution enhances the negotiating position of the city to secure additional community benefits.

3584
05:06:10,089 --> 05:06:10,470
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

3585
05:06:14,094 --> 05:06:14,895
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Barris.

3586
05:06:14,955 --> 05:06:17,878
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll go next to Councilor Tseng and then Councilor Scarpelli.

3587
05:06:18,576 --> 05:06:23,197
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll be so brief because I think President Baird has captured a lot of what I think very well.

3588
05:06:23,898 --> 05:06:25,038
[SPEAKER_19]: I think two things can be true.

3589
05:06:25,358 --> 05:06:30,480
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a lot of, there are good things about this project, adding beds is something that our city has set as a goal.

3590
05:06:31,120 --> 05:06:39,682
[SPEAKER_19]: And I know a lot of Councilors ran on and that's something that will alleviate housing costs and address much, much of the problems in the hillside.

3591
05:06:40,042 --> 05:06:44,724
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, the things that energy efficiency is good and all of that to mixed use development is good.

3592
05:06:45,645 --> 05:06:50,235
[SPEAKER_19]: I think the other thing can be true too, that there are real concerns about

3593
05:06:51,218 --> 05:07:00,962
[SPEAKER_19]: shade about the for-profit management company that's going to come in, what that means for the students who are going to live there, their rights, and the accountability process there.

3594
05:07:02,643 --> 05:07:13,368
[SPEAKER_19]: There's the process concerns that Councilor Bears mentioned, and the need for trust and social trust in a big institution like that, that many of us call neighbors.

3595
05:07:14,728 --> 05:07:18,770
[SPEAKER_19]: And that means to patch up that trust and to work on that trust means doing things

3596
05:07:19,190 --> 05:07:24,857
[SPEAKER_19]: that you don't have to do not do more than the bare minimum and doing being a good neighbor.

3597
05:07:25,397 --> 05:07:27,420
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think that's the definition of being a good neighbor.

3598
05:07:27,440 --> 05:07:30,563
[SPEAKER_19]: So engaging with community, addressing resident concerns and all of that.

3599
05:07:31,604 --> 05:07:33,787
[SPEAKER_19]: Look, we don't have a lot, a lot of tools as a city.

3600
05:07:35,449 --> 05:07:39,834
[SPEAKER_19]: And there isn't, as Councilor, as President Barrett said, there's a power imbalance here.

3601
05:07:40,754 --> 05:07:44,476
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think that's something that we all need to get innovative about.

3602
05:07:44,856 --> 05:07:51,798
[SPEAKER_19]: But I think that's something that this council has been intent on with the many steps that President Perez lays out in this resolution.

3603
05:07:53,038 --> 05:07:56,520
[SPEAKER_19]: I think our residents deserve to be heard by a big institution.

3604
05:07:57,120 --> 05:08:00,541
[SPEAKER_19]: They deserve to feel like they were heard and were engaged in the process.

3605
05:08:03,302 --> 05:08:04,082
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Councilor Sheng.

3606
05:08:05,083 --> 05:08:05,783
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Scarpelli.

3607
05:08:07,804 --> 05:08:08,304
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, wait, sorry.

3608
05:08:08,424 --> 05:08:09,024
[SPEAKER_18]: I did your mic wrong.

3609
05:08:12,907 --> 05:08:14,348
[SPEAKER_29]: I too talked to Rocco DiRico.

3610
05:08:14,388 --> 05:08:23,029
[SPEAKER_29]: First, I think we're very fortunate both between Barbara and Rocco and having liaisons from Tufts University that pick up the phone the minute we call them.

3611
05:08:23,089 --> 05:08:25,670
[SPEAKER_29]: So I think that's a huge benefit.

3612
05:08:26,550 --> 05:08:35,792
[SPEAKER_29]: But I truly believe what our neighbors are saying when you talk about, you know, these different corridors and you look at

3613
05:08:36,383 --> 05:08:42,666
[SPEAKER_29]: you know, 12 stories, and how frightening that is, and Tufts even conceding to 10 stories.

3614
05:08:44,387 --> 05:08:55,433
[SPEAKER_29]: And I've seen all the concessions that Tufts made, and I've been fortunate enough to be involved with a mayor that was directly involved with Tufts University.

3615
05:08:55,913 --> 05:09:02,177
[SPEAKER_29]: And he allowed me to watch him be a partner, but make sure that

3616
05:09:04,622 --> 05:09:08,923
[SPEAKER_29]: his community was present and getting the best with that community needed.

3617
05:09:09,703 --> 05:09:16,645
[SPEAKER_29]: And what's frightening to me is what we see, and I'm gonna be critical and I could care less if anybody cares or not.

3618
05:09:17,506 --> 05:09:19,426
[SPEAKER_29]: It's 1215, so who cares?

3619
05:09:20,066 --> 05:09:33,250
[SPEAKER_29]: But when we are talking about this mayor and the process that's been happening since August, and all of a sudden she comes out now, well, she should have been present from the beginning when you talk about our neighbors.

3620
05:09:34,184 --> 05:09:36,345
[SPEAKER_29]: and their impact of the quality of life.

3621
05:09:37,305 --> 05:09:39,205
[SPEAKER_29]: You're seeing it all over the community, by the way.

3622
05:09:40,186 --> 05:09:54,449
[SPEAKER_29]: That's why the community is now focused on creating groups and paying attorneys and fighting because they don't believe that this administration can fight for their rights and their beliefs.

3623
05:09:57,030 --> 05:09:58,090
[SPEAKER_29]: So, um,

3624
05:09:59,958 --> 05:10:05,799
[SPEAKER_29]: I too disagree with the size of this dormitory.

3625
05:10:06,019 --> 05:10:19,082
[SPEAKER_29]: I appreciate the fact that everybody is focused on housing and how important it is, but I truly don't think it's going to impact the housing like people think.

3626
05:10:19,142 --> 05:10:24,343
[SPEAKER_29]: I have two kids in college, and the first thing they wanted to do is get out of a dorm.

3627
05:10:28,682 --> 05:10:32,605
[SPEAKER_29]: I wish that it's gonna open up some housing around that area.

3628
05:10:32,845 --> 05:10:39,731
[SPEAKER_29]: I just don't see it happening, but I also see the impact that this is gonna make for residents.

3629
05:10:39,771 --> 05:10:54,262
[SPEAKER_29]: So, but again, I did see and had discussions with Mr. DeRico and understanding the information that was put out there.

3630
05:10:55,109 --> 05:10:58,291
[SPEAKER_29]: and how many people they touched to make sure that everybody knew about it.

3631
05:10:58,791 --> 05:11:04,475
[SPEAKER_29]: One thing you knew in that neighborhood, people knew that Tufts was putting forth this development.

3632
05:11:05,815 --> 05:11:09,317
[SPEAKER_29]: And people were talking about it, but it seemed like nobody was listening until the 12th hour.

3633
05:11:09,858 --> 05:11:11,038
[SPEAKER_29]: Now all of a sudden, we're scrambling.

3634
05:11:11,619 --> 05:11:18,503
[SPEAKER_29]: Because I think the truth of the matter is, if you talk to Tufts University and you said, as much as we love our environmental plan,

3635
05:11:20,112 --> 05:11:30,182
[SPEAKER_29]: Maybe some concessions would have been made to alleviate some of those big ticket items that could have supported maybe dropping it down to eight stories.

3636
05:11:31,363 --> 05:11:35,247
[SPEAKER_29]: And it wouldn't affected a quarter of the shading for the neighbors.

3637
05:11:36,728 --> 05:11:37,869
[SPEAKER_29]: But there were no discussions.

3638
05:11:38,330 --> 05:11:42,394
[SPEAKER_29]: We're coming in right now and hoping that people do the right thing.

3639
05:11:43,422 --> 05:11:54,925
[SPEAKER_29]: So again, when it comes time, I think this community should really wake up and understand what has this administration done in the last five and a half years?

3640
05:11:56,485 --> 05:11:59,266
[SPEAKER_29]: And are you willing to give these people another two years?

3641
05:11:59,426 --> 05:12:01,506
[SPEAKER_29]: Because it's not working.

3642
05:12:02,246 --> 05:12:04,307
[SPEAKER_29]: That office is not working for this community.

3643
05:12:05,487 --> 05:12:05,807
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

3644
05:12:08,052 --> 05:12:09,112
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

3645
05:12:09,132 --> 05:12:12,093
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to go next to seeing no further comment from City Councilors.

3646
05:12:12,113 --> 05:12:14,074
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to go next to public participation.

3647
05:12:15,054 --> 05:12:17,015
[SPEAKER_18]: Seeing nobody at the podium, we'll go first to Zoom.

3648
05:12:17,095 --> 05:12:19,375
[SPEAKER_18]: Every speaker will have three minutes.

3649
05:12:22,656 --> 05:12:27,318
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll go in order that I see you in.

3650
05:12:27,778 --> 05:12:31,819
[SPEAKER_18]: Jeremy Martin, please state your name and address for the record, and you have three minutes.

3651
05:12:33,052 --> 05:12:33,792
[SPEAKER_45]: Good evening, everyone.

3652
05:12:33,812 --> 05:12:34,953
[SPEAKER_45]: My name is Jeremy Martin.

3653
05:12:34,973 --> 05:12:36,854
[SPEAKER_45]: I live at 65 Burgett Ave.

3654
05:12:36,874 --> 05:12:41,016
[SPEAKER_45]: I also serve as a Medford Conservation Commissioner.

3655
05:12:41,677 --> 05:12:45,639
[SPEAKER_45]: Thanks for the opportunity to speak tonight in your consideration of this resolution.

3656
05:12:46,159 --> 05:12:49,201
[SPEAKER_45]: It's late, and I'll try to speak quickly, even though that's not my usual style.

3657
05:12:50,161 --> 05:12:54,403
[SPEAKER_45]: I appreciate the support of City Council President Bears in proposing this resolution.

3658
05:12:54,463 --> 05:13:06,868
[SPEAKER_45]: I also want to thank Director Alicia Hunt, her staff, and the Community Development Board for all of the really difficult work that they do to review complex projects like Tufts' proposed high-rise residential building on Boston Avenue.

3659
05:13:07,588 --> 05:13:13,571
[SPEAKER_45]: And to the Mayor's credit, she has met with the community members and has written a letter on our behalf, and we appreciate that as well.

3660
05:13:14,389 --> 05:13:26,896
[SPEAKER_45]: In my professional life, I've worked on many large development projects, often on university campuses, and I have never experienced a community engagement process that has been as disingenuous and disappointing as what we've experienced on this project.

3661
05:13:27,517 --> 05:13:34,661
[SPEAKER_45]: I want to be clear, the only reason that this neighborhood knows about this project is because we, the neighbors, have socialized it.

3662
05:13:35,161 --> 05:13:36,261
[SPEAKER_45]: We've gotten the word out.

3663
05:13:37,282 --> 05:13:44,124
[SPEAKER_45]: You should see the map that shows the distribution of CDB hearing announcements.

3664
05:13:44,364 --> 05:13:45,025
[SPEAKER_45]: It's pathetic.

3665
05:13:45,165 --> 05:13:50,947
[SPEAKER_45]: It goes all the way to Main Street, and it excludes my house, which is literally in the shadow of this building.

3666
05:13:51,027 --> 05:13:54,448
[SPEAKER_45]: So first and foremost, the process has to change.

3667
05:13:54,568 --> 05:13:55,528
[SPEAKER_45]: It has to be better.

3668
05:13:56,208 --> 05:13:58,369
[SPEAKER_45]: And that can start in a lot of places.

3669
05:13:58,849 --> 05:14:01,150
[SPEAKER_45]: I appreciate that there's an opportunity to speak about it.

3670
05:14:01,710 --> 05:14:02,050
[SPEAKER_45]: tonight.

3671
05:14:03,051 --> 05:14:09,053
[SPEAKER_45]: Tufts continues to say that they respect their neighbors and care about the community's concerns, but this is a misrepresentation.

3672
05:14:09,893 --> 05:14:16,636
[SPEAKER_45]: We have made repeated calls to make changes to this building design and not a single thing about the building design has changed.

3673
05:14:17,176 --> 05:14:24,038
[SPEAKER_45]: What has changed is the addition of street trees to the plan only after neighbors called for those trees, not on Tufts' behalf.

3674
05:14:24,478 --> 05:14:26,439
[SPEAKER_45]: They did it because we put pressure on them to do it.

3675
05:14:26,499 --> 05:14:30,180
[SPEAKER_45]: And that should be a baseline criteria for a project of this scale.

3676
05:14:30,800 --> 05:14:35,501
[SPEAKER_45]: In 2024, are we really having to fight for street trees and for better sidewalks?

3677
05:14:35,541 --> 05:14:36,281
[SPEAKER_45]: That's ridiculous.

3678
05:14:37,121 --> 05:14:45,984
[SPEAKER_45]: Hopefully, you've seen and read the numerous letters from residents, including the letter that garnered over 50 signatures in opposition specifically to the height of the proposed building.

3679
05:14:46,804 --> 05:14:53,095
[SPEAKER_45]: We have continually stated our support for development on this site and our support for increasing student housing on campus.

3680
05:14:53,515 --> 05:14:59,325
[SPEAKER_45]: We would all agree, and we do agree, that improving housing availability and affordability in our city is a critical goal.

3681
05:15:00,336 --> 05:15:09,598
[SPEAKER_45]: But as Councilors have said tonight, that's not guaranteed, that's not promised, especially if Tufts doesn't change their policy about housing juniors and seniors on campus.

3682
05:15:10,039 --> 05:15:10,959
[SPEAKER_45]: It's wishful thinking.

3683
05:15:11,379 --> 05:15:16,120
[SPEAKER_45]: We also see a pattern of Tufts buying residential and commercial properties in our neighborhood.

3684
05:15:16,520 --> 05:15:20,902
[SPEAKER_45]: What happens when more rental units can't be rented and become available for sale?

3685
05:15:20,942 --> 05:15:21,802
[SPEAKER_45]: What's gonna happen then?

3686
05:15:23,590 --> 05:15:28,933
[SPEAKER_45]: However, the direct impacts of this massive and out-of-scale building are real and tangible.

3687
05:15:29,174 --> 05:15:38,940
[SPEAKER_45]: Blocked sun exposure for multiple months out of the year, increased nighttime light and noise pollution, and the exacerbation of safety issues on this already underperforming street.

3688
05:15:39,380 --> 05:15:49,646
[SPEAKER_45]: These will be lifelong impacts to residents' finances, property values, health, safety, and privacy, and a $500,000 payoff is not going to solve them.

3689
05:15:50,267 --> 05:15:50,827
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Jeremy.

3690
05:15:50,847 --> 05:15:52,588
[SPEAKER_18]: We appreciate your comments today.

3691
05:15:54,480 --> 05:15:56,782
[SPEAKER_45]: After all of that, you'll cut me off now, okay.

3692
05:15:57,883 --> 05:15:59,824
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I would encourage you to vote yes.

3693
05:15:59,844 --> 05:16:00,825
[SPEAKER_18]: You can finish your sentence.

3694
05:16:00,905 --> 05:16:01,886
[SPEAKER_18]: It sounded like you were at the end.

3695
05:16:02,767 --> 05:16:13,656
[SPEAKER_45]: No, I'll just say that until they come to the table with real options, real improvements, we need the city to continue to support us using every tool possible.

3696
05:16:14,056 --> 05:16:17,539
[SPEAKER_45]: This resolution is a great way of doing that, and I ask that you vote yes without delay.

3697
05:16:17,719 --> 05:16:17,919
[SPEAKER_45]: Thanks.

3698
05:16:22,352 --> 05:16:25,013
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll go next to James on Zoom.

3699
05:16:25,313 --> 05:16:26,213
[SPEAKER_18]: Name and address for the record.

3700
05:16:26,233 --> 05:16:28,714
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm gonna also have three minutes.

3701
05:16:28,834 --> 05:16:29,194
[SPEAKER_18]: Go for it.

3702
05:16:30,174 --> 05:16:30,514
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

3703
05:16:31,454 --> 05:16:32,755
[SPEAKER_32]: My name is James Encolada.

3704
05:16:32,815 --> 05:16:35,075
[SPEAKER_32]: I live at 135 Brigette Ave.

3705
05:16:38,336 --> 05:16:43,878
[SPEAKER_32]: A lot of what I wanna say really has already been said, but there are some other things I wanted to add to it as well.

3706
05:16:45,958 --> 05:16:47,719
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm almost insulted when I hear

3707
05:16:48,669 --> 05:16:53,891
[SPEAKER_32]: Tufts University, especially at last night's meeting, that this building will be a benefit to the community.

3708
05:16:54,911 --> 05:17:03,155
[SPEAKER_32]: I wanna say, I wanted to tell you what some of the benefits that I'm going to get from this building as well as my neighbors.

3709
05:17:04,315 --> 05:17:17,140
[SPEAKER_32]: First of all is that this building is gonna block the sun for probably over, for about 60 homes in the neighborhood for two to three hours a day, every day for the rest of our lives.

3710
05:17:18,223 --> 05:17:23,946
[SPEAKER_32]: Some of us with solar panels and things like that, they're gonna be losing energy.

3711
05:17:24,986 --> 05:17:33,891
[SPEAKER_32]: A Tufts representative last night said to, I believe it was Jeremy last night at the meeting, oh, well, it's only gonna block the sun for a couple of hours a day.

3712
05:17:33,971 --> 05:17:35,131
[SPEAKER_32]: It's not that big of a deal.

3713
05:17:35,191 --> 05:17:36,592
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, to Jeremy, it is a big deal.

3714
05:17:36,612 --> 05:17:39,694
[SPEAKER_32]: And to everyone else who has solar panels, that is a big deal.

3715
05:17:41,255 --> 05:17:45,997
[SPEAKER_32]: And it's frustrating when you're met with that brick wall of a response.

3716
05:17:47,051 --> 05:17:49,593
[SPEAKER_32]: and we don't feel like we're hurting.

3717
05:17:51,114 --> 05:17:55,296
[SPEAKER_32]: The next thing I'm gonna bring up is what I call an invasion of privacy.

3718
05:17:56,717 --> 05:18:06,904
[SPEAKER_32]: For the rest of my life, I'm gonna go out into my backyard and look up and see 600 students staring down into my property.

3719
05:18:07,785 --> 05:18:11,527
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm sure this building is gonna have cameras all over it, surveillance cameras.

3720
05:18:11,647 --> 05:18:12,968
[SPEAKER_32]: Every building built now is gonna

3721
05:18:14,693 --> 05:18:18,554
[SPEAKER_32]: And so now I'm under 24 hours surveillance, both by students and cameras.

3722
05:18:19,055 --> 05:18:20,195
[SPEAKER_32]: Who wants to live like that?

3723
05:18:20,255 --> 05:18:22,616
[SPEAKER_32]: That's not a good quality of life for your neighbors.

3724
05:18:26,057 --> 05:18:28,178
[SPEAKER_32]: The next thing I'm gonna say is the light pollution.

3725
05:18:30,079 --> 05:18:37,782
[SPEAKER_32]: They're stealing the sun from us during the day, and then they're gonna be blasting us with electronic light at night.

3726
05:18:38,162 --> 05:18:38,962
[SPEAKER_32]: When does it stop?

3727
05:18:41,823 --> 05:18:46,365
[SPEAKER_32]: And of course, now the neighborhood has to sit through another two years of construction.

3728
05:18:47,386 --> 05:18:51,608
[SPEAKER_32]: I bought my house in 2015, and the construction hasn't stopped since.

3729
05:18:53,189 --> 05:19:01,213
[SPEAKER_32]: From all the Tufts buildings all around us, from the Cummings Center, to the power plant, to the fitness center, to Halligan Hall, it doesn't stop.

3730
05:19:01,414 --> 05:19:03,635
[SPEAKER_32]: We are living in a permanent construction zone.

3731
05:19:04,275 --> 05:19:05,576
[SPEAKER_32]: At least that's the way I feel.

3732
05:19:06,636 --> 05:19:07,657
[SPEAKER_18]: You got 20 seconds, James.

3733
05:19:08,798 --> 05:19:09,678
[SPEAKER_32]: Very frustrating.

3734
05:19:10,253 --> 05:19:14,475
[SPEAKER_32]: And I'm going to say that the last thing I'm going to say is don't be fooled by Tufts.

3735
05:19:15,496 --> 05:19:21,859
[SPEAKER_32]: They're not, the rental, taking students out of the rental population is not really going to change anything.

3736
05:19:22,139 --> 05:19:25,081
[SPEAKER_32]: They're just going to increase their student population in the years to come.

3737
05:19:25,141 --> 05:19:32,645
[SPEAKER_32]: And we're going to be right back to where we started, except we're going to have to live in the shadow of this building, literally for the rest of our lives.

3738
05:19:33,125 --> 05:19:33,505
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

3739
05:19:33,525 --> 05:19:35,346
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for your comments, James.

3740
05:19:36,820 --> 05:19:39,804
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll go next to Laurel name and address for the record, please.

3741
05:19:39,904 --> 05:19:40,605
[SPEAKER_18]: You have three minutes.

3742
05:19:42,126 --> 05:19:42,647
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks, everyone.

3743
05:19:43,067 --> 05:19:44,950
[SPEAKER_13]: Laurel Ruma 149 Burgett Avenue.

3744
05:19:45,390 --> 05:19:49,996
[SPEAKER_13]: So let me just clear up some misunderstanding the city councilors have.

3745
05:19:52,503 --> 05:19:53,763
[SPEAKER_13]: This isn't the 12th hour.

3746
05:19:54,323 --> 05:19:57,384
[SPEAKER_13]: This is the 90th day this plan has been submitted.

3747
05:19:57,884 --> 05:20:08,487
[SPEAKER_13]: We found out about this plan September 28th and have been moving every single day, going to meetings, writing letters, like non-stop.

3748
05:20:09,387 --> 05:20:10,488
[SPEAKER_13]: This is not the 12th hour.

3749
05:20:10,608 --> 05:20:14,509
[SPEAKER_13]: This is Tufts spending 90 days to push this through.

3750
05:20:14,929 --> 05:20:16,769
[SPEAKER_13]: And in 90 days, they're gonna break ground.

3751
05:20:21,066 --> 05:20:30,454
[SPEAKER_13]: What business in this city has ever been able to build two 10-story buildings in 90 days?

3752
05:20:30,915 --> 05:20:32,116
[SPEAKER_13]: It's absurd.

3753
05:20:36,239 --> 05:20:37,801
[SPEAKER_13]: Tufts does not feel like a bully.

3754
05:20:38,401 --> 05:20:39,222
[SPEAKER_13]: Tufts is a bully.

3755
05:20:39,923 --> 05:20:46,128
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm Cassandra here telling you, for all these years, with the Green Line extension,

3756
05:20:48,779 --> 05:21:00,203
[SPEAKER_13]: If you want value-engineered architecture, which is what we have at the bottom of this hill, because we are the back end of Tufts campus, that part of campus Tufts does not care about, this is what we have.

3757
05:21:00,643 --> 05:21:07,565
[SPEAKER_13]: We have a cogeneration plant, we have the parking garage, and now we'll have the two dorm buildings dumping out.

3758
05:21:08,445 --> 05:21:13,049
[SPEAKER_13]: We already have a 10-story building at Cummings Building.

3759
05:21:13,630 --> 05:21:17,393
[SPEAKER_13]: We are one of the seven houses that are in shadow because of the building.

3760
05:21:17,794 --> 05:21:18,854
[SPEAKER_13]: And guess what?

3761
05:21:18,955 --> 05:21:25,821
[SPEAKER_13]: At the end of Burgett, because the shadows affect from Charnwood to Burgett, Brookings, Hume, Sunset,

3762
05:21:27,513 --> 05:21:28,294
[SPEAKER_13]: 67 houses.

3763
05:21:28,974 --> 05:21:43,545
[SPEAKER_13]: We get shadows from those two 10-story buildings, which I refuse to call dorms because they're apartment buildings, rented at market rates for 12-month leases to a company that is not a non-profit, right?

3764
05:21:43,926 --> 05:21:46,628
[SPEAKER_13]: Their partner is a for-profit company.

3765
05:21:47,148 --> 05:21:53,413
[SPEAKER_13]: So what we're talking about here is Tufts has offered zero concessions, zero.

3766
05:21:54,702 --> 05:21:58,684
[SPEAKER_13]: As Jeremy said, street trees don't count because they have to get approval from the MBTA.

3767
05:21:59,524 --> 05:22:00,445
[SPEAKER_13]: Try doing that.

3768
05:22:00,745 --> 05:22:05,287
[SPEAKER_13]: Listen, some of you may remember I spent 12 years working with the MBTA just to get the green light here.

3769
05:22:05,647 --> 05:22:06,547
[SPEAKER_13]: There's no street trees.

3770
05:22:06,587 --> 05:22:08,748
[SPEAKER_13]: They took all the trees intentionally, right?

3771
05:22:10,849 --> 05:22:11,970
[SPEAKER_13]: This is not the bare minimum.

3772
05:22:12,290 --> 05:22:14,031
[SPEAKER_13]: This is how bad it is.

3773
05:22:14,751 --> 05:22:18,192
[SPEAKER_13]: We're not exaggerating the seriousness of the situation.

3774
05:22:18,533 --> 05:22:19,993
[SPEAKER_13]: The city has opportunities.

3775
05:22:20,453 --> 05:22:21,754
[SPEAKER_13]: The city can work.

3776
05:22:22,796 --> 05:22:28,100
[SPEAKER_13]: to our benefit, it just takes a lot of energy and money for the city to do that.

3777
05:22:28,760 --> 05:22:34,224
[SPEAKER_13]: And I understand why the city would not want to do that, but I have to tell you, zero concessions, zero.

3778
05:22:34,985 --> 05:22:38,147
[SPEAKER_13]: The $500,000 fund they're proposing does not exist.

3779
05:22:38,548 --> 05:22:42,390
[SPEAKER_13]: And how are they possibly going to distribute $500,000 to residents?

3780
05:22:42,511 --> 05:22:43,851
[SPEAKER_13]: That's completely unfair.

3781
05:22:44,792 --> 05:22:47,514
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, it's just, I would please read our letters.

3782
05:22:47,654 --> 05:22:49,796
[SPEAKER_13]: Like we are not hysterical here.

3783
05:22:52,881 --> 05:22:54,462
[SPEAKER_13]: This is another bad deal.

3784
05:22:54,803 --> 05:22:57,105
[SPEAKER_13]: Three 10-story buildings on one block.

3785
05:22:58,486 --> 05:22:59,667
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not fair to everyone.

3786
05:22:59,827 --> 05:23:03,571
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you so much for your comments.

3787
05:23:05,152 --> 05:23:07,454
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to go next to Lori on Zoom.

3788
05:23:07,474 --> 05:23:09,416
[SPEAKER_18]: Name and address for the record, please.

3789
05:23:09,456 --> 05:23:10,036
[SPEAKER_18]: You have three minutes.

3790
05:23:10,657 --> 05:23:11,137
[SPEAKER_44]: Hi there.

3791
05:23:11,157 --> 05:23:13,800
[SPEAKER_44]: I'm Lori Krieger, 124 Brookings Street.

3792
05:23:14,080 --> 05:23:18,264
[SPEAKER_44]: I get to go to bed to that building that exists there now with all the lights on.

3793
05:23:18,988 --> 05:23:20,329
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you for doing this.

3794
05:23:20,389 --> 05:23:23,131
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you, Zach and everyone for being here.

3795
05:23:24,292 --> 05:23:28,335
[SPEAKER_44]: Everyone that's spoken so far has just told the truth, and we really need your help.

3796
05:23:29,816 --> 05:23:33,999
[SPEAKER_44]: Each time we've met, Tufts presents the same structure without mitigation of any kind.

3797
05:23:34,619 --> 05:23:43,406
[SPEAKER_44]: Our biggest concern as a neighborhood is the bulk and height of the building is out of scale with any other buildings on the campus or in the immediate area to an extreme level.

3798
05:23:44,184 --> 05:24:00,414
[SPEAKER_44]: While Tufts has a significant amount of property upon which they could build multiple dorms that would accommodate the same number of students and retain the character of the neighborhood, Tufts is choosing to act as a bully without regard or concern to the negative impact they would inflict on its neighbors.

3799
05:24:00,994 --> 05:24:07,058
[SPEAKER_44]: They have grown so attached to this project they refuse to come to the table to negotiate or provide mitigation of any kind.

3800
05:24:08,015 --> 05:24:15,939
[SPEAKER_44]: Rather than being a pillar of the community, Tufts is choosing to assault the community with its will valuing only itself.

3801
05:24:16,579 --> 05:24:20,761
[SPEAKER_44]: The intention of the Dover Amendment was to protect nonprofits from discrimination.

3802
05:24:21,501 --> 05:24:31,466
[SPEAKER_44]: Somehow this has become so turned around that Tufts as a nonprofit is using it to discriminate against us and render us impotent to protect our lives and homes.

3803
05:24:32,066 --> 05:24:35,468
[SPEAKER_44]: The inversion is cruel and inhumane and it needs to end here.

3804
05:24:36,337 --> 05:24:42,959
[SPEAKER_44]: We all want housing for Tufts students on the Tufts campus and we've demonstrated there are many locations on the body of the campus to do that.

3805
05:24:43,720 --> 05:24:49,141
[SPEAKER_44]: There is no essential need for Tufts to build 210 story buildings that cause detriment to their neighbors.

3806
05:24:49,582 --> 05:24:53,363
[SPEAKER_44]: It's simply that people who work at Tufts refuse to entertain other solutions.

3807
05:24:54,204 --> 05:25:01,147
[SPEAKER_44]: The Community Development Board is able to limit the building's bulk and height, and we recommend that they do such.

3808
05:25:01,707 --> 05:25:06,449
[SPEAKER_44]: Please let the city protect the citizens from being harmed by callous behavior.

3809
05:25:07,189 --> 05:25:11,191
[SPEAKER_44]: It's appropriate to mitigate height, noise, and light related to the proposed buildings.

3810
05:25:11,951 --> 05:25:17,374
[SPEAKER_44]: And it's appropriate to keep the height and scale such that we retain the current amount of sun we have all year.

3811
05:25:17,954 --> 05:25:22,496
[SPEAKER_44]: Some body needs to take a protective stance toward the people who live here.

3812
05:25:23,544 --> 05:25:28,868
[SPEAKER_44]: I'm a butter and will live in the shadow of these buildings should they be allowed to go forward without constraint.

3813
05:25:29,368 --> 05:25:34,491
[SPEAKER_44]: We've been meeting with Tufts regularly since they invited the public to be present at their meetings.

3814
05:25:34,971 --> 05:25:39,574
[SPEAKER_44]: We've brought up issues regarding heights, loss of sunlight, increased noise, ambient light, et cetera.

3815
05:25:40,015 --> 05:25:45,198
[SPEAKER_44]: Tufts hasn't changed the proposal to meet any of the community requests, not any, or our needs.

3816
05:25:45,698 --> 05:25:49,501
[SPEAKER_44]: They have demonstrated they do not value us as a community or a partner.

3817
05:25:50,077 --> 05:25:55,859
[SPEAKER_44]: They're not acting in good faith with those who would be significantly impacted by these buildings.

3818
05:25:56,379 --> 05:25:58,219
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you for drafting this resolution.

3819
05:25:58,279 --> 05:25:58,980
[SPEAKER_44]: We support it.

3820
05:25:59,180 --> 05:25:59,920
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you so much.

3821
05:26:02,661 --> 05:26:03,561
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for your comments.

3822
05:26:04,781 --> 05:26:06,382
[SPEAKER_18]: Go next to Lisa on Zoom.

3823
05:26:06,622 --> 05:26:07,902
[SPEAKER_18]: Name and address for the record, please.

3824
05:26:07,942 --> 05:26:08,562
[SPEAKER_18]: You have three minutes.

3825
05:26:10,483 --> 05:26:12,164
[SPEAKER_47]: Hi, my name is Lisa DiMatteo.

3826
05:26:12,244 --> 05:26:14,544
[SPEAKER_47]: My address is 138 Brookings Street.

3827
05:26:18,863 --> 05:26:39,073
[SPEAKER_47]: And to be specific, that's the very end of Brookings Street that faces, well, it used to face a bank, a small bank of forest that is no longer there due to the MBTA project and the removal of all of the trees.

3828
05:26:39,173 --> 05:26:46,016
[SPEAKER_47]: So now I face the backside of Tufts campus and

3829
05:26:49,505 --> 05:27:09,666
[SPEAKER_47]: Tufts is proposing that I'll now face 300 windows and 700 residents in a brick building that will remove any visible sky from my view.

3830
05:27:11,835 --> 05:27:20,381
[SPEAKER_47]: All of the neighbors that have spoken up tonight have said it better than I could possibly say it at 1230 in the morning.

3831
05:27:21,702 --> 05:27:25,045
[SPEAKER_47]: We're not hysterical, we're just tired.

3832
05:27:26,786 --> 05:27:30,329
[SPEAKER_47]: This has been 90 days of insanity.

3833
05:27:30,349 --> 05:27:38,315
[SPEAKER_47]: And I really don't know what else I can add except to say that

3834
05:27:40,180 --> 05:27:50,447
[SPEAKER_47]: Underline that Tufts hasn't provided anything that they will have you believe that they are providing.

3835
05:27:54,049 --> 05:27:54,589
[SPEAKER_47]: Nothing.

3836
05:27:56,331 --> 05:28:04,256
[SPEAKER_47]: And there's no way for any of us who are going to be life alteringly impacted

3837
05:28:05,757 --> 05:28:11,001
[SPEAKER_47]: to receive any mitigation, including the rumored mitigation.

3838
05:28:11,942 --> 05:28:14,303
[SPEAKER_47]: And that's all it is, is rumors.

3839
05:28:17,405 --> 05:28:30,295
[SPEAKER_47]: So whatever this resolution is about, I just really hope that it could act in support of the residents because

3840
05:28:32,336 --> 05:28:41,200
[SPEAKER_47]: Tufts expansion into the neighborhood that has a particular character will not stop.

3841
05:28:43,901 --> 05:28:45,662
[SPEAKER_47]: It will not stop.

3842
05:28:47,462 --> 05:28:48,423
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you for listening.

3843
05:28:48,443 --> 05:28:51,344
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you so much.

3844
05:28:52,244 --> 05:28:56,006
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll go next to, one second.

3845
05:28:56,766 --> 05:28:58,447
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll go next to Janie.

3846
05:28:58,467 --> 05:29:00,348
[SPEAKER_18]: Name and address for the record, please.

3847
05:29:00,388 --> 05:29:01,128
[SPEAKER_18]: You have three minutes.

3848
05:29:04,497 --> 05:29:04,997
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

3849
05:29:05,277 --> 05:29:09,278
[SPEAKER_12]: It's Janie Tallarita, 68 Charnwood Road.

3850
05:29:11,218 --> 05:29:25,221
[SPEAKER_12]: And I, there's nothing I can add that my friends and neighbors haven't already said, but I wanted to speak in support of this resolution.

3851
05:29:25,481 --> 05:29:33,762
[SPEAKER_12]: And so that you all understand how important this is and that the imbalance of power

3852
05:29:34,534 --> 05:29:38,197
[SPEAKER_12]: between Tufts and Medford is so significant.

3853
05:29:38,377 --> 05:29:40,198
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm one of the lucky ones.

3854
05:29:40,278 --> 05:29:42,940
[SPEAKER_12]: My house is just outside the shadow.

3855
05:29:45,542 --> 05:29:52,428
[SPEAKER_12]: But as it is, I've had to move bedrooms because of the lights from the existing buildings shining in.

3856
05:29:52,468 --> 05:29:56,211
[SPEAKER_12]: I've had to move to where I had some tree cover.

3857
05:29:56,511 --> 05:29:57,552
[SPEAKER_12]: I've had to plant trees.

3858
05:30:00,174 --> 05:30:01,074
[SPEAKER_12]: That's all fine.

3859
05:30:01,895 --> 05:30:02,375
[SPEAKER_12]: Not really.

3860
05:30:04,890 --> 05:30:09,011
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, I really just want, I care about this community.

3861
05:30:09,071 --> 05:30:10,271
[SPEAKER_12]: I care about my neighbors.

3862
05:30:10,371 --> 05:30:11,871
[SPEAKER_12]: I care about this community.

3863
05:30:11,971 --> 05:30:23,054
[SPEAKER_12]: And so it's important to me that we don't have two gargantuan 10 story buildings that are so completely out of scale.

3864
05:30:24,014 --> 05:30:27,715
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, architecture is really important in a, in a community.

3865
05:30:27,795 --> 05:30:34,376
[SPEAKER_12]: It's an, this is, this is the built environment is what we look at, what we exist in, what we see.

3866
05:30:36,979 --> 05:30:43,462
[SPEAKER_12]: Love the idea of students being on campus and the vibrancy that they bring to a neighborhood.

3867
05:30:43,542 --> 05:30:50,766
[SPEAKER_12]: Love the idea of, you know, ground floor bringing businesses in.

3868
05:30:52,027 --> 05:30:53,447
[SPEAKER_12]: We can do it with six stories.

3869
05:30:53,928 --> 05:30:57,710
[SPEAKER_12]: We can do it without having to have 10 stories.

3870
05:30:58,330 --> 05:31:01,992
[SPEAKER_12]: We can do it, Tufts can do it by utilizing

3871
05:31:03,789 --> 05:31:08,551
[SPEAKER_12]: all the other properties that they've bought and left empty, like the hillside hardware.

3872
05:31:10,151 --> 05:31:21,215
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, if we want to increase housing, let's get Tufts building and they're using the property that they already have and let us have our sunlight.

3873
05:31:23,336 --> 05:31:28,878
[SPEAKER_12]: Let us have our, let us have our community as it should be.

3874
05:31:28,898 --> 05:31:31,419
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think that's it.

3875
05:31:31,559 --> 05:31:31,839
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks.

3876
05:31:33,524 --> 05:31:34,465
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you so much for your comments.

3877
05:31:37,227 --> 05:31:40,469
[SPEAKER_18]: I see, Elizabeth, your hand up again.

3878
05:31:40,529 --> 05:31:43,071
[SPEAKER_18]: Is this a hand from before, or do you want to speak for an additional minute?

3879
05:31:47,794 --> 05:31:49,696
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't mean to put my hand down.

3880
05:31:49,896 --> 05:31:50,436
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

3881
05:31:50,516 --> 05:31:53,718
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Janie still on.

3882
05:31:54,439 --> 05:31:54,919
[SPEAKER_18]: OK, great.

3883
05:31:54,959 --> 05:31:56,160
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll give you one additional minute.

3884
05:31:56,901 --> 05:31:57,221
[SPEAKER_18]: Go for it.

3885
05:32:01,212 --> 05:32:05,637
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry, did you say that you did mean to put your hand down or you'd like to speak again on this topic?

3886
05:32:07,198 --> 05:32:08,339
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't spoken on it.

3887
05:32:09,401 --> 05:32:10,041
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, I'm sorry.

3888
05:32:10,061 --> 05:32:10,822
[SPEAKER_18]: It's really late.

3889
05:32:11,002 --> 05:32:15,147
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought that I clicked my mouse and my hand went down.

3890
05:32:15,207 --> 05:32:18,190
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't mean to put my hand down, but I haven't spoken yet.

3891
05:32:19,657 --> 05:32:20,237
[SPEAKER_18]: My mistake.

3892
05:32:20,697 --> 05:32:21,938
[SPEAKER_18]: Name and address for the record, please.

3893
05:32:21,998 --> 05:32:23,279
[SPEAKER_18]: And you have three whole minutes.

3894
05:32:24,240 --> 05:32:29,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Elizabeth Bayle, 34 Emery Street.

3895
05:32:29,384 --> 05:32:39,213
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish you all could have been at the Tufts community meeting last night where I think all the people that spoke tonight

3896
05:32:40,345 --> 05:32:53,890
[SPEAKER_06]: were and Tufts had invited people to submit questions when they RSVP to the meeting and didn't address any of those to my knowledge.

3897
05:32:53,930 --> 05:32:57,571
[SPEAKER_06]: They certainly didn't address mine, so I read it at the meeting.

3898
05:32:59,648 --> 05:33:01,809
[SPEAKER_06]: they're not going to change anything.

3899
05:33:02,009 --> 05:33:02,770
[SPEAKER_06]: It's clear.

3900
05:33:03,170 --> 05:33:04,551
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so obvious.

3901
05:33:04,991 --> 05:33:11,455
[SPEAKER_06]: And as far as communication, I think George Scarpelli said that people have known about this project.

3902
05:33:12,015 --> 05:33:18,499
[SPEAKER_06]: I did not know about this project, and I live, you know, like a block from it.

3903
05:33:20,340 --> 05:33:23,662
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not a direct-to-butter, but I care about the

3904
05:33:26,141 --> 05:33:32,946
[SPEAKER_06]: I've lived here since 1987, and we were very active on trying to get the green line here.

3905
05:33:32,966 --> 05:33:38,369
[SPEAKER_06]: And I care about Medford hillside and the feel of the place.

3906
05:33:39,250 --> 05:33:44,294
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is just, you know, plopping a high rise down in the middle of

3907
05:33:45,606 --> 05:33:46,987
[SPEAKER_06]: a residential neighborhood.

3908
05:33:47,107 --> 05:33:52,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Tufts doesn't want this building in their interior of their campus where they could put it.

3909
05:33:52,632 --> 05:33:58,978
[SPEAKER_06]: They've got all those temporary buildings where the tennis courts used to be along Professor's Row.

3910
05:33:59,058 --> 05:34:04,782
[SPEAKER_06]: They've got space on Packard Ave and Talbot Ave where they could put dorms.

3911
05:34:04,923 --> 05:34:06,644
[SPEAKER_06]: They could put multiple buildings.

3912
05:34:06,724 --> 05:34:10,908
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't want a high-rise sticking in the middle of their campus.

3913
05:34:10,948 --> 05:34:11,688
[SPEAKER_06]: They're putting it

3914
05:34:12,609 --> 05:34:15,611
[SPEAKER_06]: where they don't really have to see it.

3915
05:34:15,731 --> 05:34:36,401
[SPEAKER_06]: And they've just been building up this area with the Cummings Center and whatever that building is that has all the utilities and stuff, and buying residences around here and transforming them into university properties, like the building that used to be an artist building.

3916
05:34:37,345 --> 05:34:44,970
[SPEAKER_06]: and multiple other, that wasn't a residence obviously, but a lot of the residences, it just takes them off the tax rolls.

3917
05:34:45,890 --> 05:34:52,454
[SPEAKER_06]: And I found out about this on October 28th.

3918
05:34:52,535 --> 05:34:55,316
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't even know about the September meeting.

3919
05:34:55,536 --> 05:35:05,122
[SPEAKER_06]: And I do try to stay, I get the Tufts newsletter and do try to stay up on what they're doing, but there's no time.

3920
05:35:06,869 --> 05:35:11,812
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no time that we've had to understand or make changes in this.

3921
05:35:11,912 --> 05:35:15,935
[SPEAKER_06]: I think six stories is even too big for this area.

3922
05:35:16,355 --> 05:35:31,545
[SPEAKER_06]: If you look at the sphere, that building on the way to Ball Square on Boston Ave, that's a sort of transit-oriented development, which there isn't much space for around because Tufts owns all of the property.

3923
05:35:31,645 --> 05:35:35,588
[SPEAKER_06]: So we can't have real retail or things that would contribute

3924
05:35:36,168 --> 05:35:37,169
[SPEAKER_06]: to the community.

3925
05:35:37,709 --> 05:35:39,831
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to give you just another moment to finish your thought.

3926
05:35:39,851 --> 05:35:40,351
[SPEAKER_18]: Apologies.

3927
05:35:40,391 --> 05:35:48,377
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I guess I just thank you for doing the resolution and I hope you pass it because we need all the help we can get.

3928
05:35:48,437 --> 05:35:54,481
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not getting anywhere and it's going to be a permanent blight on the neighborhood.

3929
05:35:55,982 --> 05:35:56,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

3930
05:35:56,363 --> 05:35:58,284
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you so much for your comments.

3931
05:36:01,496 --> 05:36:04,862
[SPEAKER_18]: Seeing no additional public comment on zoom or in the chambers.

3932
05:36:04,962 --> 05:36:07,246
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there any additional comment by city councilors?

3933
05:36:10,512 --> 05:36:21,040
[SPEAKER_18]: I would just say for myself as one Councilor, I am a staunch proponent of Tufts working to take more responsibility for housing the students that it enrolls.

3934
05:36:21,460 --> 05:36:32,449
[SPEAKER_18]: And I very much resent this process, which has led so many neighbors and abutters feeling so left out and unconsidered in this process.

3935
05:36:34,190 --> 05:36:41,296
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we're all aware that Tufts is a very large, very wealthy institution, and there are many ways to solve this problem of needing to house more students on campus.

3936
05:36:44,138 --> 05:36:52,445
[SPEAKER_18]: On the motion of President Bears, seconded by Councilor Callahan, Mr. Clerk, when you're ready, please call the roll.

3937
05:37:04,943 --> 05:37:05,544
[SPEAKER_36]: President Bears.

3938
05:37:08,227 --> 05:37:08,908
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Callahan.

3939
05:37:10,590 --> 05:37:11,471
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Lazzaro.

3940
05:37:12,292 --> 05:37:12,832
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Leming.

3941
05:37:13,273 --> 05:37:13,573
[SPEAKER_35]: Yes.

3942
05:37:14,434 --> 05:37:15,135
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Scarpelli.

3943
05:37:15,335 --> 05:37:15,535
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes.

3944
05:37:16,236 --> 05:37:16,757
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Tseng.

3945
05:37:17,818 --> 05:37:18,639
[SPEAKER_36]: Vice President Collins.

3946
05:37:19,100 --> 05:37:19,320
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

3947
05:37:20,001 --> 05:37:21,162
[SPEAKER_18]: Seven in favor, none opposed.

3948
05:37:21,182 --> 05:37:22,223
[SPEAKER_18]: The resolution passes.

3949
05:37:22,263 --> 05:37:25,167
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you so much to all the constituents who wait on us.

3950
05:37:35,188 --> 05:37:41,133
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, it's funny, the name bears derives from Pierce, and this picks it up as Pierce, which is so interesting.

3951
05:37:42,173 --> 05:37:43,895
[SPEAKER_24]: We should talk about that for 15 minutes, I think.

3952
05:37:47,297 --> 05:37:51,260
[SPEAKER_24]: All right, last item on the agenda, legally required referral.

3953
05:37:51,701 --> 05:38:01,268
[SPEAKER_24]: This is our proposed amendments to the Benford Zoning Ordinance, Salem Street Corridor District for referral to the Community Development Board.

3954
05:38:08,584 --> 05:38:16,028
[SPEAKER_24]: Is there a motion to first we need a motion to waive the reading for a brief summary.

3955
05:38:17,688 --> 05:38:23,011
[SPEAKER_24]: So moved on that motion by Councilor Collins seconded by Councilor let me Mr. Clerk please call the roll.

3956
05:38:44,861 --> 05:38:45,441
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Callahan.

3957
05:38:46,982 --> 05:38:47,762
[SPEAKER_36]: Vice President Collins.

3958
05:38:48,543 --> 05:38:49,363
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Lazzaro.

3959
05:38:50,003 --> 05:38:50,544
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Leming.

3960
05:38:51,004 --> 05:38:51,284
[SPEAKER_35]: Yes.

3961
05:38:52,224 --> 05:38:52,765
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Scarpelli.

3962
05:38:52,785 --> 05:38:52,845
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes.

3963
05:38:53,945 --> 05:38:54,466
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Tseng.

3964
05:38:54,626 --> 05:38:54,746
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes.

3965
05:38:55,166 --> 05:38:55,726
[SPEAKER_36]: President Bears.

3966
05:38:55,846 --> 05:38:56,126
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

3967
05:38:56,226 --> 05:38:58,307
[SPEAKER_24]: I have a negative motion passes.

3968
05:38:58,447 --> 05:39:03,110
[SPEAKER_24]: So this is the proposed Salem Street Corridor Zoning District.

3969
05:39:03,170 --> 05:39:05,791
[SPEAKER_24]: This is the product of several meetings of the Planning and Permitting Committee.

3970
05:39:06,731 --> 05:39:10,113
[SPEAKER_24]: The memorandum contains the draft text for the following proposed zoning changes.

3971
05:39:10,785 --> 05:39:20,113
[SPEAKER_24]: to amend 94 dash 2.1 division into districts to amend 94 dash 3.2 table of use regulations and dimensional standards to end table.

3972
05:39:21,101 --> 05:39:27,303
[SPEAKER_24]: of dimensional requirements to amend the definitions and to insert the section 94-9X Salem Street Corridor District.

3973
05:39:28,924 --> 05:39:32,125
[SPEAKER_24]: And so that is the summary of this.

3974
05:39:32,785 --> 05:39:37,607
[SPEAKER_24]: There's obviously much more detail here in this document of proposed zoning changes.

3975
05:39:38,347 --> 05:39:41,448
[SPEAKER_24]: But what I'm going to do for now is I'm just going to outline the process here.

3976
05:39:42,288 --> 05:39:51,571
[SPEAKER_24]: So, um, two years ago, uh, the city released a comprehensive plan that comprehensive plan includes a number of recommendations around updates to the city zoning.

3977
05:39:51,591 --> 05:39:59,673
[SPEAKER_24]: Uh, last year, the city council received funding and issued an RFP for proposals for zoning consultant.

3978
05:39:59,753 --> 05:40:06,435
[SPEAKER_24]: We were able to choose the proposal of Innis associates, which is a group that has a lot of done a lot of great work.

3979
05:40:06,455 --> 05:40:07,195
[SPEAKER_24]: They are, um,

3980
05:40:07,918 --> 05:40:15,744
[SPEAKER_24]: the proponent primary writers of the regulations for the MBTA Communities Act and also we're our consultant on the comprehensive plan.

3981
05:40:15,764 --> 05:40:19,266
[SPEAKER_24]: So they have intimate knowledge of the city's comprehensive plan and its zoning requirements.

3982
05:40:20,307 --> 05:40:28,833
[SPEAKER_24]: Since then, the planning and permitting committee has held 16 or 17 meetings this year with Innis Associates regarding a zoning updates project.

3983
05:40:28,893 --> 05:40:33,597
[SPEAKER_24]: It's reported out a number of items including this, the Salem Street Corridor District.

3984
05:40:34,346 --> 05:40:38,308
[SPEAKER_24]: At this point, this is a vote to refer to the Community Development Board this initial proposal.

3985
05:40:39,008 --> 05:40:41,869
[SPEAKER_24]: From this point forward, there will be two public hearings.

3986
05:40:42,549 --> 05:40:48,652
[SPEAKER_24]: Community Development Board will open a public hearing, followed by the City Council opening a public hearing, which people can be heard.

3987
05:40:48,672 --> 05:41:01,276
[SPEAKER_24]: Community Development Board will review this and make recommendations to the City Council, and the City Council will then consider this, consider those recommendations, consider any other amendments, and then take a final vote on whether to amend the city's zoning ordinance.

3988
05:41:04,099 --> 05:41:08,524
[SPEAKER_24]: Similarly, earlier tonight if folks are paying attention or were attending this meeting earlier.

3989
05:41:09,786 --> 05:41:16,834
[SPEAKER_24]: We approved the Mystic Avenue corridor district, which followed the same process, and this amendment and other amendments will also have

3990
05:41:18,129 --> 05:41:28,959
[SPEAKER_24]: several public meetings, generally at least two of the council before the public hearings, followed by at least two public hearings, and sometimes those public hearings occur over multiple meetings as well.

3991
05:41:29,239 --> 05:41:34,644
[SPEAKER_24]: So this proposal will go to the Community Development Board for a public hearing in the new year.

3992
05:41:36,986 --> 05:41:39,348
[SPEAKER_24]: Recognizing Councilor Collins and then Councilor Scarpelli.

3993
05:41:41,411 --> 05:41:42,192
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Bears.

3994
05:41:42,632 --> 05:41:45,434
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to restate the timeline that you just laid out.

3995
05:41:46,274 --> 05:41:59,323
[SPEAKER_18]: Very grateful to city staff, residents, and our zoning consultant that joined us for our two recent meetings on the draft zoning proposal for the Salem Street Corridor District in the Planning and Permitting Committee.

3996
05:42:00,003 --> 05:42:02,965
[SPEAKER_18]: And this is really just a midway point in the process.

3997
05:42:05,607 --> 05:42:07,809
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll go to the Community Development Board for public hearings.

3998
05:42:07,829 --> 05:42:09,050
[SPEAKER_18]: They will promulgate recommendations.

3999
05:42:09,090 --> 05:42:11,632
[SPEAKER_18]: We will hear those before the City Council again before we take a vote.

4000
05:42:12,173 --> 05:42:14,314
[SPEAKER_18]: So I have a motion to refer this to the Community Development Board.

4001
05:42:14,695 --> 05:42:17,557
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry, motion to refer this to the Community Development Board.

4002
05:42:18,298 --> 05:42:23,262
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion of Councilor Collins to refer to the Community Development Board, seconded by Councilor Tseng, I will recognize Councilor Skarpuk.

4003
05:42:24,537 --> 05:42:25,338
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Mr. President.

4004
05:42:25,518 --> 05:42:34,787
[SPEAKER_29]: Again, as we start this process, you know, we're now seeing that we're now delving into more residential neighborhoods.

4005
05:42:34,927 --> 05:42:47,400
[SPEAKER_29]: So my request and recommendation would be to hold our next public meeting at the Roberts Elementary School, where it could be a process for all the people that feel that

4006
05:42:48,109 --> 05:42:58,177
[SPEAKER_29]: they haven't been heard, or they feel that they haven't been able to come to these meetings, that we put this meeting into their backyard as requested back when we wrote the RFP.

4007
05:42:59,337 --> 05:43:14,389
[SPEAKER_29]: Again, I know we've been trying our best to be more transparent and give more people an opportunity to share and be part of the process, but I would truly recommend as a motion that we ask to move

4008
05:43:15,965 --> 05:43:24,829
[SPEAKER_29]: one of the final meetings to the neighborhood directly so we can hear from the neighbors in their backyard.

4009
05:43:24,849 --> 05:43:27,990
[SPEAKER_29]: So I would make that as a form of motion if I can.

4010
05:43:30,151 --> 05:43:30,992
[SPEAKER_24]: Is that a B paper?

4011
05:43:31,352 --> 05:43:31,812
[SPEAKER_29]: If I can.

4012
05:43:32,372 --> 05:43:32,572
[SPEAKER_24]: Sure.

4013
05:43:32,632 --> 05:43:38,795
[SPEAKER_24]: That's a B paper from Councilor Scarpelli to hold a regular meeting or sorry, what meeting?

4014
05:43:39,796 --> 05:43:43,037
[SPEAKER_29]: Whichever, I know that we have, when is that next?

4015
05:43:44,815 --> 05:44:11,565
[SPEAKER_29]: Right after CD, if we can, after that, if we can come back and get some input from the neighbors that we can present that the CB, their ideas and their input, and then really get the neighbors' involvement and at least be part of that final solution and the changes that are gonna be made there.

4016
05:44:12,025 --> 05:44:13,446
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, sorry, what?

4017
05:44:15,012 --> 05:44:32,232
[SPEAKER_24]: i guess the public hearing of the council after the community development board that'd be great i will have to check to see if that's possible with the tv station and hybrid meetings any further comment on the resolution or the b paper i'll go to councillor callahan

4018
05:44:35,023 --> 05:44:46,233
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah, I would simply request that we do the same thing we did for the last thing, which is just remove strike table abuse regulations line eight.

4019
05:44:47,734 --> 05:44:50,016
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, this is just for referral to Community Development Board.

4020
05:44:50,476 --> 05:44:56,081
[SPEAKER_24]: If we want to include as an amendment that there's a recommendation to strike A8.

4021
05:44:56,141 --> 05:44:58,923
[SPEAKER_24]: All right.

4022
05:45:00,825 --> 05:45:01,606
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Collins.

4023
05:45:04,358 --> 05:45:06,259
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, sorry, my mic was on before.

4024
05:45:07,520 --> 05:45:10,261
[SPEAKER_18]: But just want to note, I support the intent of the B paper.

4025
05:45:10,281 --> 05:45:23,867
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not sure if logistically it'll be possible to have a CDB meeting or a city council regular meeting at the Roberts School, but I think it's in the spirit of making sure that we're continuing to improve our efforts of involving local abutters and neighbors in the process.

4026
05:45:24,068 --> 05:45:29,090
[SPEAKER_18]: So if that results in a meeting at the Roberts, we're just continuing to try to do a better and better job each time and inviting the neighbors.

4027
05:45:29,850 --> 05:45:31,111
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm more than happy to do that.

4028
05:45:32,315 --> 05:45:38,818
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, and I would just note that we're 2,500 feet from the Roberts School right now in this chamber.

4029
05:45:40,259 --> 05:45:49,523
[SPEAKER_24]: And I would just also note that the proposal that we accepted didn't include the number of meetings that we're talking about here.

4030
05:45:49,743 --> 05:45:56,766
[SPEAKER_24]: So I'll see what we can do around the logistics of it.

4031
05:45:58,167 --> 05:45:58,947
[SPEAKER_24]: But Councilor Lazzaro?

4032
05:46:00,771 --> 05:46:06,396
[SPEAKER_40]: I think that would have been a great idea for one of the many planning and permitting committee meetings that we've had already.

4033
05:46:07,077 --> 05:46:09,459
[SPEAKER_40]: But I mean, well, it was never a motion.

4034
05:46:09,479 --> 05:46:11,020
[SPEAKER_40]: It was never proposed as a motion.

4035
05:46:11,040 --> 05:46:13,242
[SPEAKER_24]: All right, guys, like, let's just close it up here.

4036
05:46:13,262 --> 05:46:15,304
[SPEAKER_24]: Literally the proposal that we accepted.

4037
05:46:15,324 --> 05:46:17,045
[SPEAKER_40]: The Community Development Board is not this body.

4038
05:46:17,065 --> 05:46:17,926
[SPEAKER_24]: If I could, thank you.

4039
05:46:23,531 --> 05:46:26,614
[SPEAKER_24]: The proposal that we accepted regarding the zoning consultant

4040
05:46:27,355 --> 05:46:29,917
[SPEAKER_24]: did not include the meetings that have been discussed.

4041
05:46:30,017 --> 05:46:38,965
[SPEAKER_24]: Even though they were in the request for proposal, the proposal that this council, not even this council, the previous council voted to accept, it's just in the proposal.

4042
05:46:39,885 --> 05:46:41,527
[SPEAKER_24]: You can't disagree with the document.

4043
05:46:42,007 --> 05:46:42,968
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not possible.

4044
05:46:49,913 --> 05:46:51,295
[SPEAKER_24]: I went back and read the document.

4045
05:46:53,056 --> 05:46:53,617
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, I did.

4046
05:46:54,257 --> 05:46:55,058
[SPEAKER_24]: What do you mean I didn't?

4047
05:46:56,587 --> 05:46:57,908
[SPEAKER_24]: What are you talking about?

4048
05:46:59,489 --> 05:47:00,229
[SPEAKER_24]: Good Lord.

4049
05:47:01,550 --> 05:47:01,830
[SPEAKER_24]: Go.

4050
05:47:04,492 --> 05:47:18,341
[SPEAKER_24]: It's just like, if there's no commitment to the truth, I have a duty as the chair to ensure that the members of this body have accurate factual information.

4051
05:47:18,661 --> 05:47:20,142
[SPEAKER_24]: It's a fundamental duty of this role.

4052
05:47:21,403 --> 05:47:23,144
[SPEAKER_24]: And I will not abrogate it.

4053
05:47:23,484 --> 05:47:24,565
[SPEAKER_24]: Public participation.

4054
05:47:25,362 --> 05:47:26,442
[SPEAKER_24]: Name and address for the record, please.

4055
05:47:26,462 --> 05:47:27,302
[SPEAKER_24]: You have three minutes.

4056
05:47:30,903 --> 05:47:31,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you ready?

4057
05:47:31,243 --> 05:47:31,843
[SPEAKER_24]: You have three minutes.

4058
05:47:32,644 --> 05:47:35,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street.

4059
05:47:35,244 --> 05:47:37,645
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty much a direct abutter to this.

4060
05:47:37,685 --> 05:47:41,206
[SPEAKER_04]: There were a lot of neighbors that were here and left.

4061
05:47:41,266 --> 05:47:47,067
[SPEAKER_04]: This meeting started yesterday, five hours and 46 minutes ago, and they couldn't stay any longer.

4062
05:47:47,587 --> 05:47:52,348
[SPEAKER_04]: I really don't think this should be voted to go forward today without their input.

4063
05:47:52,788 --> 05:48:02,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Because much like you, the last resolution where you say Tufts is bullying the city, many residents in that neighborhood feel that this committee, the planning committee, is bullying us.

4064
05:48:02,973 --> 05:48:12,557
[SPEAKER_04]: This zoning is a 70% reduction in the lot size needed to build an apartment building on Salem Street and the side streets.

4065
05:48:13,755 --> 05:48:22,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Somerville is the densest city in our nation with a population density of 19,656.8 people per square mile.

4066
05:48:23,404 --> 05:48:26,727
[SPEAKER_04]: That translates to 30.7 people per acre.

4067
05:48:27,447 --> 05:48:31,671
[SPEAKER_04]: A side street zoning off of Salem Street that was proposed by your committee

4068
05:48:32,552 --> 05:48:34,633
[SPEAKER_04]: will have 87 families per acre.

4069
05:48:34,834 --> 05:48:35,774
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the side street.

4070
05:48:36,415 --> 05:48:46,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Even a family of two would make the minimum you are proposing six times the density that exists in Somerville, the nation's densest city.

4071
05:48:47,342 --> 05:48:53,646
[SPEAKER_04]: The Salem Street zoning of six floors on a 3,000 square foot lot would be 174 families per acre.

4072
05:48:57,876 --> 05:49:03,078
[SPEAKER_04]: if we guess at 12 units per building, and 12 times what Somerville has.

4073
05:49:03,998 --> 05:49:11,821
[SPEAKER_04]: The MBCA Communities Act that many cities are suing to avoid complying with is only 15 units per acre.

4074
05:49:12,761 --> 05:49:17,023
[SPEAKER_04]: The minimum zoning on side streets is six times that much.

4075
05:49:18,177 --> 05:49:20,999
[SPEAKER_04]: and about 12 times in the six-story zoning.

4076
05:49:21,759 --> 05:49:29,044
[SPEAKER_04]: All these buildings are proposed on lots too small for a single family home to be built on.

4077
05:49:30,168 --> 05:49:38,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't laugh as you live in West Medford with 6,000 square feet to build a single, and my neighborhood is going to have dozens of units.

4078
05:49:39,257 --> 05:49:41,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Please direct her not to make faces at me.

4079
05:49:41,899 --> 05:49:43,541
[SPEAKER_24]: Please be an adult.

4080
05:49:43,601 --> 05:49:50,368
[SPEAKER_04]: The lots are so small that most of these lots will add zero affordable units.

4081
05:49:50,388 --> 05:49:51,949
[SPEAKER_04]: 10% of six units is zero.

4082
05:49:52,990 --> 05:49:53,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Zero units.

4083
05:49:53,771 --> 05:49:54,692
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a full unit.

4084
05:49:56,141 --> 05:49:58,523
[SPEAKER_04]: These will all be luxury priced units.

4085
05:49:59,224 --> 05:50:02,707
[SPEAKER_04]: The zoning also allows by special permit pot shops.

4086
05:50:03,428 --> 05:50:08,512
[SPEAKER_04]: With all this dense residential housing, you have allowed pot shops on this street.

4087
05:50:09,974 --> 05:50:12,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Car ownership in Massachusetts is at 87.9%.

4088
05:50:13,417 --> 05:50:19,843
[SPEAKER_04]: In Medford specifically, the average car ownership is two cars per household.

4089
05:50:20,694 --> 05:50:22,457
[SPEAKER_04]: We are not near rapid transit.

4090
05:50:23,058 --> 05:50:28,506
[SPEAKER_04]: We only have one low-frequency bus that takes you to the T. They will own cars.

4091
05:50:29,588 --> 05:50:35,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Reducing or removing parking will lead to hundreds of cars on the street looking for parking.

4092
05:50:35,919 --> 05:50:38,220
[SPEAKER_04]: These lots are too small for large amounts of parking.

4093
05:50:38,240 --> 05:50:41,681
[SPEAKER_04]: 23.6% of households have school age children.

4094
05:50:41,801 --> 05:50:44,402
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't support that amount of children added to our schools.

4095
05:50:44,782 --> 05:50:47,383
[SPEAKER_04]: This neighborhood can't handle all the density.

4096
05:50:47,764 --> 05:50:54,986
[SPEAKER_04]: This is gross negligence and shows a complete lack of care for quality of life for current and future residents in this area.

4097
05:50:55,427 --> 05:51:01,729
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lack of understanding of the fact that residential is a negative return for a municipality

4098
05:51:02,089 --> 05:51:07,654
[SPEAKER_04]: And if this goes through, we cannot financially support the density you are proposing.

4099
05:51:07,674 --> 05:51:08,114
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

4100
05:51:08,134 --> 05:51:09,715
[SPEAKER_24]: That's three minutes.

4101
05:51:09,855 --> 05:51:10,736
[SPEAKER_04]: One more sentence, please.

4102
05:51:10,756 --> 05:51:10,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

4103
05:51:11,016 --> 05:51:11,437
[SPEAKER_24]: Go ahead.

4104
05:51:12,738 --> 05:51:20,484
[SPEAKER_04]: There is no commercial percentage requirements to help make this zoning self-sufficient and is far too dense.

4105
05:51:20,944 --> 05:51:25,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Please don't push this forward without the community having a chance to survive.

4106
05:51:25,888 --> 05:51:26,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

4107
05:51:28,491 --> 05:51:29,111
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

4108
05:51:29,451 --> 05:51:30,352
[SPEAKER_24]: Name and address for the record, please.

4109
05:51:30,372 --> 05:51:31,053
[SPEAKER_24]: You have three minutes.

4110
05:51:32,810 --> 05:51:35,151
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Paulette Vardabedi, 27th Central Lab.

4111
05:51:35,411 --> 05:51:45,616
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to reiterate something that I brought up two or three meetings ago, that this Salem Street corridor is already a huge traffic jam.

4112
05:51:46,436 --> 05:51:50,979
[SPEAKER_03]: From Felsway all the way on to the Rotary, it's a traffic jam.

4113
05:51:51,559 --> 05:52:00,843
[SPEAKER_03]: I asked, have there been a traffic study done to see if Salem Street can accommodate these extra cars that are 100% going to be

4114
05:52:02,503 --> 05:52:05,545
[SPEAKER_03]: adding to both Salem Street and the Felsway.

4115
05:52:06,426 --> 05:52:14,150
[SPEAKER_03]: And the response at that time was, oh, they're not going to be a problem because we're on a bus line.

4116
05:52:14,190 --> 05:52:16,592
[SPEAKER_03]: They're either going to ride the bus or take their bikes.

4117
05:52:17,512 --> 05:52:21,495
[SPEAKER_03]: That is idealism in the utmost.

4118
05:52:22,796 --> 05:52:23,636
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to happen.

4119
05:52:23,656 --> 05:52:24,777
[SPEAKER_03]: There's going to be more cars.

4120
05:52:25,297 --> 05:52:28,840
[SPEAKER_03]: My other question at that time, again, two or three meetings ago was,

4121
05:52:30,255 --> 05:52:36,618
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe at that meeting, we talked about the three schools in Medford that are already overcapacity.

4122
05:52:37,218 --> 05:52:43,180
[SPEAKER_03]: Roberts Junior High, Roberts, whatever it is now, is one of those three overcapacity schools.

4123
05:52:43,741 --> 05:52:51,124
[SPEAKER_03]: These students that are going to be in these houses, I mean, they're not going to just be one bedroom that you're going to exclude kids.

4124
05:52:52,796 --> 05:52:57,206
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are you going to put these kids if Roberts is already over capacity?

4125
05:52:57,607 --> 05:53:00,935
[SPEAKER_03]: So the traffic and the children need to be addressed.

4126
05:53:01,542 --> 05:53:05,745
[SPEAKER_03]: if you're going to increase the housing on this stretch.

4127
05:53:05,865 --> 05:53:18,135
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other thing as a personal level that I brought up last time is my street, Central Ave, which is parallel one block in from Salem Street, is already affected by cars using it as a cut-through street.

4128
05:53:19,156 --> 05:53:26,802
[SPEAKER_03]: So this increased traffic is going to also increase the traffic on Central Avenue, which is a family, a lot of kids,

4129
05:53:27,537 --> 05:53:28,978
[SPEAKER_03]: going to change the whole dynamics.

4130
05:53:29,098 --> 05:53:35,481
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not opposed to having apartments or redeveloping this section.

4131
05:53:35,561 --> 05:53:36,181
[SPEAKER_03]: It's old.

4132
05:53:36,922 --> 05:53:38,242
[SPEAKER_03]: It needs to be brought up.

4133
05:53:38,863 --> 05:53:43,805
[SPEAKER_03]: But it can't just be the spoke of the wheel.

4134
05:53:44,145 --> 05:53:46,806
[SPEAKER_03]: The spoke of the wheel could be a great, great idea.

4135
05:53:47,106 --> 05:53:50,008
[SPEAKER_03]: But you have to look at the hub of the wheel.

4136
05:53:50,908 --> 05:53:52,489
[SPEAKER_03]: The hub of the wheel could be great.

4137
05:53:52,749 --> 05:53:55,971
[SPEAKER_03]: But you have to look at what the spokes are

4138
05:53:57,025 --> 05:54:00,227
[SPEAKER_03]: doing as well to see what they're impacting.

4139
05:54:00,708 --> 05:54:06,291
[SPEAKER_03]: You could have a great idea, but if it doesn't have good impact, it's not a great idea.

4140
05:54:06,652 --> 05:54:18,220
[SPEAKER_03]: So just I'm asking you to look into the traffic study, look into the schooling and also the dynamics that this is going to affect the neighboring streets.

4141
05:54:18,480 --> 05:54:18,820
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

4142
05:54:19,040 --> 05:54:19,481
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

4143
05:54:19,501 --> 05:54:23,804
[SPEAKER_24]: Any further public comment?

4144
05:54:27,085 --> 05:54:30,768
[SPEAKER_24]: Seeing none, is there any further discussion on this referral to the Community Development Board?

4145
05:54:31,088 --> 05:54:32,650
[SPEAKER_24]: We do have one more public comment on Zoom.

4146
05:54:33,070 --> 05:54:35,112
[SPEAKER_24]: I will go to Zoom.

4147
05:54:36,052 --> 05:54:42,258
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Castagnetti, you have three minutes.

4148
05:54:42,338 --> 05:54:43,599
[SPEAKER_24]: Name and address for the record, please.

4149
05:54:58,868 --> 05:55:01,110
[SPEAKER_24]: Trying to unmute you, but we're only, there you go.

4150
05:55:01,370 --> 05:55:03,772
[SPEAKER_24]: All right, thank you, please.

4151
05:55:04,773 --> 05:55:05,794
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, we can hear you, please.

4152
05:55:07,275 --> 05:55:07,575
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

4153
05:55:07,615 --> 05:55:09,937
[SPEAKER_09]: Andrew Castagnetti, Cushman Street, Method Mass.

4154
05:55:11,538 --> 05:55:21,546
[SPEAKER_09]: Just wanted to ask you, where do we stand with my donation to the city about hanging the Christmas lights from the footbridge on Mystic River?

4155
05:55:22,067 --> 05:55:23,568
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you know where we stand with that?

4156
05:55:23,608 --> 05:55:24,649
[SPEAKER_09]: Was the check accepted?

4157
05:55:26,349 --> 05:55:27,470
[SPEAKER_24]: The donation was accepted.

4158
05:55:28,070 --> 05:55:29,031
[SPEAKER_24]: We did accept it.

4159
05:55:29,111 --> 05:55:32,793
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm not sure what the next steps are from the administration in terms of lights.

4160
05:55:33,473 --> 05:55:37,395
[SPEAKER_24]: If any member of the council would like to volunteer to follow up on that.

4161
05:55:37,635 --> 05:55:43,238
[SPEAKER_24]: If not, I will see if I can get a follow-up from the administration and I could try to email it to you, Andy.

4162
05:55:45,019 --> 05:55:45,759
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate it.

4163
05:55:45,779 --> 05:55:52,063
[SPEAKER_09]: If you can just get the answer because I'm hoping it would be hanging there from the memory of Larry Lepore.

4164
05:55:53,346 --> 05:55:56,969
[SPEAKER_09]: our messenger and also before Christmas will be sweet, you know.

4165
05:55:59,031 --> 05:56:08,980
[SPEAKER_09]: So anyways, I want to wish you all good holidays and a Merry Christmas, if the shoe fits, and a happy, healthy new year for everyone.

4166
05:56:09,400 --> 05:56:09,760
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

4167
05:56:09,940 --> 05:56:10,341
[SPEAKER_09]: Good night.

4168
05:56:11,422 --> 05:56:11,982
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

4169
05:56:12,182 --> 05:56:13,924
[SPEAKER_24]: And Councilor Lazzaro is going to follow up on that.

4170
05:56:13,984 --> 05:56:15,025
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Councilor Lazzaro.

4171
05:56:18,167 --> 05:56:18,428
[SPEAKER_35]: Yes.

4172
05:56:19,304 --> 05:56:26,885
[SPEAKER_24]: James D, I'm just gonna have to ask you to change your last name so I can see it before I recognize you.

4173
05:56:34,027 --> 05:56:36,687
[SPEAKER_24]: All right, I'm gonna recognize James, Darren.

4174
05:56:38,028 --> 05:56:39,388
[SPEAKER_24]: Name and address for the record, please.

[SPEAKER_24]: You have three minutes.

4176
05:56:58,539 --> 05:57:00,200
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, that's about how this meeting's gone.

4177
05:57:00,220 --> 05:57:11,903
[SPEAKER_24]: I think probably not, but there is public participation.

4178
05:57:11,923 --> 05:57:13,404

4185
05:57:32,616 --> 05:57:34,856
[SPEAKER_36]: 4 in the affirmative, 3 in the negative.

05:59:08,111 --> 05:59:10,894
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to say that it's disgusting that you just passed that.

4203
05:59:11,614 --> 05:59:13,195
[SPEAKER_04]: You should be considering the neighborhood.

4204
05:59:13,215 --> 05:59:14,637
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't care about the neighborhood.

4205
05:59:14,657 --> 05:59:16,798
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't care about what your density is going to bring.

4206
05:59:16,818 --> 05:59:18,099
[SPEAKER_04]: You think it's funny.

4207
05:59:18,440 --> 05:59:22,523
[SPEAKER_04]: You're giggling at people that stay here till one in the morning, and it's not nice.

4208
05:59:22,903 --> 05:59:23,684
[SPEAKER_04]: It's disgusting.

4209
05:59:23,724 --> 05:59:27,627
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to destroy the neighborhood, and you don't even care because you don't live there.

4210
05:59:30,196 --> 05:59:30,976
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you for your comments.

4211
