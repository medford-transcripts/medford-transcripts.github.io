[SPEAKER_05]: Present, seven present, none absent.

14
00:00:13,418 --> 00:00:15,019

[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

21
00:00:39,643 --> 00:00:40,464
[SPEAKER_05]: April 3rd meeting?

22
00:00:41,264 --> 00:00:41,424
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

23
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,643
[SPEAKER_07]: But I just want to make sure that he realizes that we voted to buy and purchase those.

24
00:00:52,683 --> 00:00:56,564
[SPEAKER_07]: So if the ambulance company doesn't purchase them soon, we need them for this.

25
00:00:56,824 --> 00:00:57,685
[SPEAKER_05]: They have ordered them.

26
00:00:58,365 --> 00:00:59,946
[SPEAKER_05]: We just don't have a date of delivery yet.

27
00:01:00,066 --> 00:01:00,766
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, great.

28
00:01:00,846 --> 00:01:01,186
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

[SPEAKER_05]: Van de Kloot.

[SPEAKER_15]: There is none.

52
00:01:34,687 --> 00:01:35,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Report of committees.

53
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:37,549
[SPEAKER_05]: None.

54
00:01:37,569 --> 00:01:38,790
[SPEAKER_05]: Community participation.

55
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:41,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Hearing and seeing none.

56
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:47,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Report of the superintendent, report on Connors Scholarship Program.

57
00:01:47,642 --> 00:01:48,522
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Superintendent.

58
00:01:49,002 --> 00:01:53,844
[SPEAKER_00]: Mayor and members of the school committee, you have heard undoubtedly about the Connors Scholarship Program.

59
00:01:54,964 --> 00:02:00,466
[SPEAKER_00]: It was created through the generosity of James and Thelma Connors.

60
00:02:01,186 --> 00:02:02,827
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the information in front of you.

61
00:02:04,147 --> 00:02:10,930
[SPEAKER_00]: People of modest means or apparently of modest means until the very end when their investments became

62
00:02:12,303 --> 00:02:20,065
[SPEAKER_00]: available to the city and through the work of Attorney John Granara, former Mayor Mike McGlynn, and Stephen Andrew.

63
00:02:20,805 --> 00:02:23,826
[SPEAKER_00]: It was put together into a scholarship program.

64
00:02:24,506 --> 00:02:32,668
[SPEAKER_00]: Amelia Jensen is here, our Director of Guidance, and she is reaching out to students to apply for this program.

65
00:02:33,429 --> 00:02:38,370
[SPEAKER_00]: The details are here, and happy to answer any questions you have.

66
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:43,567
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than go through it, but it's obviously a very generous activity and we're pleased to have it.

67
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:48,364
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, good evening, Mayor Burke, Superintendent Belson, and members of the school committee.

68
00:02:49,304 --> 00:02:52,927
[SPEAKER_13]: We had a pretty successful turnout for students applying for the scholarship.

69
00:02:53,427 --> 00:03:06,037
[SPEAKER_13]: While we don't know exact final numbers, since we do not collect the scholarship applications, we've had between 50 to 60 students ask counselors for the recommendation forms to be filled out.

70
00:03:06,097 --> 00:03:09,660
[SPEAKER_13]: So we expect at least 50 or 60 students to apply for the scholarship.

71
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,381
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a wonderful scholarship.

72
00:03:12,881 --> 00:03:20,003
[SPEAKER_13]: Like Mr. Bellson said, there are $33,000 scholarships that could go to Medford students.

73
00:03:20,324 --> 00:03:24,425
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're really hoping that many from Medford High School will be able to be awarded.

74
00:03:25,485 --> 00:03:25,905
[SPEAKER_13]: Excellent.

75
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:27,346
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

76
00:03:27,366 --> 00:03:27,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Disceri?

77
00:03:27,926 --> 00:03:29,327
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

78
00:03:32,075 --> 00:03:34,658
[SPEAKER_15]: This is such a wonderful thing.

79
00:03:34,718 --> 00:03:39,524
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like a dream come true for our Medford students.

80
00:03:40,745 --> 00:03:43,569
[SPEAKER_15]: Obviously, we can't express our appreciation to

81
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:50,510
[SPEAKER_15]: Jim and Thelma Connors, but we certainly owe them a huge debt of thanks for our students.

82
00:03:51,091 --> 00:03:58,514
[SPEAKER_15]: And I appreciate all the people who are working on this to make sure that it is administered correctly and that our students will benefit.

83
00:03:58,874 --> 00:04:02,835
[SPEAKER_15]: I do hope that we receive a list of all the students who receive them.

84
00:04:03,295 --> 00:04:03,455
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

85
00:04:04,016 --> 00:04:04,676
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

86
00:04:05,116 --> 00:04:05,496
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

87
00:04:06,617 --> 00:04:07,337
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Benedetto.

88
00:04:08,734 --> 00:04:14,920
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to thank your office for taking on this responsibility and getting this information out to our students.

89
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:33,636
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope it helps a lot of students that normally wouldn't get a high end scholarship because the GPA is very reasonable and it's for the average working hard student and I'm really glad to see that.

90
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:35,253
[SPEAKER_13]: One of the, yeah, I'm sorry.

91
00:04:35,273 --> 00:04:36,494
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for your office and your help.

92
00:04:36,514 --> 00:04:37,094
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, you're welcome.

93
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:52,607
[SPEAKER_13]: One of, um, one of the things that was really exciting about this scholarship is although they'd look at academic record and demonstrated leadership, um, they also look at work experience and any type of hardships that students have overcome and, um, they weigh those things somewhat equally.

94
00:04:53,067 --> 00:05:01,373
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, so some of our students who may have had to take a job to help support family or take care of their siblings, um, aren't going to be ruled out for the scholarship.

95
00:05:02,414 --> 00:05:02,755
[SPEAKER_13]: Excellent.

96
00:05:02,775 --> 00:05:03,155
[SPEAKER_12]: Amazing.

97
00:05:04,074 --> 00:05:04,614
[SPEAKER_12]: Miss Kurtz.

98
00:05:05,154 --> 00:05:05,494
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, hi.

99
00:05:05,754 --> 00:05:06,895
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Miss Jensen.

100
00:05:06,915 --> 00:05:08,375
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a great report.

101
00:05:08,955 --> 00:05:23,599
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't want to duplicate what Aaron said, but I was going to say that, you know, I thought it was a really fair grade point average where it ranged from two point three to higher levels, which is good for some students who might not be at the same grade level as others.

102
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:27,020
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's just a wonderful, generous opportunity.

103
00:05:27,513 --> 00:05:28,713
[SPEAKER_12]: for our students.

104
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:30,194
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much for the report.

105
00:05:30,214 --> 00:05:31,034
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

106
00:05:32,554 --> 00:05:32,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

107
00:05:32,754 --> 00:05:33,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Cuno.

108
00:05:34,115 --> 00:05:34,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Ms.

109
00:05:34,575 --> 00:05:38,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Jensen, to you and to your staff for being involved in this.

110
00:05:39,116 --> 00:05:44,957
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope, though, that as the students are applying for this scholarship, they really understand how they're receiving this money.

111
00:05:45,657 --> 00:05:46,998
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's a huge lesson here.

112
00:05:47,078 --> 00:05:49,858
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just, it's an incredible story.

113
00:05:50,278 --> 00:05:50,939
[SPEAKER_03]: It really is.

114
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:56,840
[SPEAKER_03]: And for people that are listening and maybe don't know the whole story, the bottom line is that

115
00:05:57,321 --> 00:06:09,565
[SPEAKER_03]: We had two people in our own city that lived very modestly and have now given, you know, they were over, like, the modest life yields, $4 million.

116
00:06:10,406 --> 00:06:11,446
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a huge lesson.

117
00:06:12,286 --> 00:06:21,110
[SPEAKER_03]: And the lesson I hope that our students get from this and for everyone, actually, that listens is this is why you always treat everybody equally, because you just don't know what happens and what's underneath anything.

118
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:23,731
[SPEAKER_03]: And to read the story, it was just a fabulous story.

119
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:25,051
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually shared it a little bit.

120
00:06:25,448 --> 00:06:43,857
[SPEAKER_03]: today with some people that I work with, and they said, I hope the city really promotes this story, because not only what they have done, but also to give the opportunity to all students, because sometimes students don't feel that they could apply for all scholarships.

121
00:06:44,258 --> 00:06:47,599
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is something really tremendous, but I thank you.

122
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,500
[SPEAKER_05]: It is wonderful.

123
00:06:49,638 --> 00:06:50,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.

124
00:06:50,058 --> 00:06:50,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

125
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:53,060
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a motion to receive in place on file?

126
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to receive in place on file.

127
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,401
[SPEAKER_05]: Seconded by Ms.

128
00:06:55,441 --> 00:06:55,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Van de Kloot.

129
00:06:56,281 --> 00:06:57,001
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

130
00:06:57,502 --> 00:06:57,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

131
00:06:57,722 --> 00:06:58,422
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

132
00:06:58,502 --> 00:06:59,223
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

133
00:07:00,703 --> 00:07:04,825
[SPEAKER_05]: Report on class of 2017 college university acceptances.

134
00:07:04,885 --> 00:07:10,288
[SPEAKER_00]: Making a return appearance is Amelia Jensen to tell you about the college acceptances to date.

135
00:07:10,308 --> 00:07:14,630
[SPEAKER_00]: This is still preliminary, but we wanted to give you a sense of what was happening out there for the time being.

136
00:07:15,466 --> 00:07:17,907
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, so the students inform the guidance department.

137
00:07:17,927 --> 00:07:19,107
[SPEAKER_13]: Their deadline is May 11.

138
00:07:19,387 --> 00:07:27,529
[SPEAKER_13]: And they inform us of all of the places that they were accepted, as well as where they have chosen to go, and their post-secondary plans.

139
00:07:28,689 --> 00:07:38,612
[SPEAKER_13]: So right now, again, this is preliminary numbers, but we've had 220 students report that they have been accepted to over 225 different colleges and universities.

140
00:07:38,712 --> 00:07:43,033
[SPEAKER_13]: And there should be an attachment that lists all of the colleges and universities.

141
00:07:43,633 --> 00:07:46,577
[SPEAKER_13]: I did want to highlight a few because this was an exceptional year.

142
00:07:47,138 --> 00:07:59,156
[SPEAKER_13]: We have had a student get into Brown University, Duke University, Harvard, Tufts University, Wellesley College, Yale University, all of the UMass schools, and many, many state schools.

143
00:07:59,616 --> 00:08:03,897
[SPEAKER_13]: and many more schools that you can look at on the attached sheet.

144
00:08:04,297 --> 00:08:09,039
[SPEAKER_13]: We also have some students who are waitlisted at some pretty good schools, so we're still waiting to hear if they have been accepted.

145
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:18,662
[SPEAKER_13]: Decision day is May 1st, so students will be making that decision, or should have already made that decision, and again should be letting us know where they're going.

146
00:08:19,527 --> 00:08:23,031
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's where we stand with colleges.

147
00:08:23,912 --> 00:08:27,175
[SPEAKER_13]: Many students also have received scholarships and awards already.

148
00:08:28,076 --> 00:08:31,039
[SPEAKER_13]: We had one student who became a national merit finalist.

149
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,047
[SPEAKER_13]: One student won a Posse scholarship, which is a full-ride scholarship, and this student will be attending Bucknell University.

150
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:47,036
[SPEAKER_13]: We had a student receive a Fulbright scholarship to Duke University because of soccer, one to Tufts University because of academics, and many more.

151
00:08:47,116 --> 00:08:50,538
[SPEAKER_13]: So again, that's also a list that we will be collecting.

152
00:08:52,319 --> 00:08:58,464
[SPEAKER_13]: Two Medford vocational technical students are currently enrolled in apprenticeship programs at night to become plumbers.

153
00:08:59,024 --> 00:09:01,846
[SPEAKER_13]: So what they're doing is they're already a year ahead of their peers.

154
00:09:02,146 --> 00:09:04,628
[SPEAKER_13]: So they're going to school during the day and at night.

155
00:09:05,389 --> 00:09:06,930
[SPEAKER_13]: So that is also very exceptional.

156
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:18,593
[SPEAKER_13]: And this was the first year that many students, I believe over 35 students, have chosen alternative post-secondary plans and options for their future.

157
00:09:19,293 --> 00:09:33,196
[SPEAKER_13]: And by this, what I mean is these are students who have below a 2.5 GPA and historically would not have been accepted to a four-year school, so they would have gone to community college or they would have chosen some other route.

158
00:09:33,976 --> 00:09:44,122
[SPEAKER_13]: Instead of that, we were able to offer them other programs and opportunities through the Rockland Earn and Learn program, Year Up, Match Beyond, and many more.

159
00:09:44,342 --> 00:09:51,126
[SPEAKER_13]: And what these programs offer is work experience and scholarships to go to college.

160
00:09:52,367 --> 00:09:54,989
[SPEAKER_13]: And I can go into more detail if you have specific questions on this.

161
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:57,270
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.

162
00:09:58,191 --> 00:09:58,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

163
00:10:00,463 --> 00:10:00,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

164
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:01,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Cuno.

165
00:10:01,504 --> 00:10:01,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

166
00:10:02,085 --> 00:10:02,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you again, Ms.

167
00:10:02,805 --> 00:10:03,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Jensen, for this report.

168
00:10:04,327 --> 00:10:08,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, extremely proud of our students.

169
00:10:09,051 --> 00:10:16,458
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just encourage, I know that we did it last year for the graduation pamphlet, if we could add this on to the graduation pamphlet again.

170
00:10:16,478 --> 00:10:17,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

171
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,403
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe even a little bit of the, you know, where the students

172
00:10:22,042 --> 00:10:25,284
[SPEAKER_03]: that received a couple of scholarships, just to give an idea.

173
00:10:26,085 --> 00:10:42,915
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason I say that is that we had had this discussion, I was on the psych council for the high school and the vocational school for many years, and what happened is that our students do get accepted to great schools, but sometimes, because of financial reasons, they choose other schools.

174
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:49,761
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard people in the audience that were saying, oh, our Meffitt students are all going to this school or that school.

175
00:10:49,801 --> 00:10:51,904
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not saying that one school is better than the other.

176
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:57,009
[SPEAKER_03]: But they were leaving the graduation just thinking that our students were going to particular schools.

177
00:10:57,689 --> 00:11:00,072
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I, when we approached it,

178
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:12,510
[SPEAKER_03]: we said it's not fair to the students because parents or relatives that come or people that just come to the graduation or just see where our students end up going doesn't necessarily mean that's where they've only been accepted to.

179
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:21,177
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's very important for the school but also for the students to let people know how hard they've worked and where they've been accepted to.

180
00:11:21,517 --> 00:11:23,899
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, we definitely plan on putting that on the graduation booklet.

181
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:24,420
[SPEAKER_13]: I agree.

182
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:24,700
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

183
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:32,292
[SPEAKER_06]: Just out of curiosity, do you know how many students have been accepted to Tufts University this year?

184
00:11:33,332 --> 00:11:35,973
[SPEAKER_13]: Seven or nine.

185
00:11:36,093 --> 00:11:40,214
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, the last time I heard, I thought it was seven, but it could have, there could be more.

186
00:11:40,234 --> 00:11:44,355
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there were seven accepted and there were multiple wait lists.

187
00:11:45,035 --> 00:11:46,936
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so we're still waiting to hear on this.

188
00:11:47,156 --> 00:11:47,556
[SPEAKER_06]: Good to know.

189
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:55,718
[SPEAKER_06]: I really, since we have one of the best colleges in the world here in our city, I really like

190
00:11:56,162 --> 00:11:58,583
[SPEAKER_06]: that partnership with Tufts University.

191
00:11:58,623 --> 00:12:02,944
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know that they look closely at taking both Method and some of those students.

192
00:12:02,984 --> 00:12:08,666
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm just always curious as to how many get accepted and then how many can afford to go after that.

193
00:12:08,766 --> 00:12:15,168
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know that Tufts can be generous at times with our students, having a daughter who graduated from there.

194
00:12:17,229 --> 00:12:23,731
[SPEAKER_06]: But also because I want to keep that opportunity for our children in our community.

195
00:12:23,971 --> 00:12:24,671
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's a great

196
00:12:25,173 --> 00:12:27,395
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a world-renowned school now.

197
00:12:27,615 --> 00:12:31,138
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's got people from all over the world coming.

198
00:12:31,678 --> 00:12:31,879
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

199
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:33,920
[SPEAKER_13]: They've been working very well with our department.

200
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,123
[SPEAKER_13]: They reach out to us monthly.

201
00:12:37,703 --> 00:12:41,046
[SPEAKER_13]: They ask for names of students who are on the Honor Society.

202
00:12:41,607 --> 00:12:43,508
[SPEAKER_13]: And they do personal outreach to our students.

203
00:12:43,528 --> 00:12:46,731
[SPEAKER_13]: So they're very good with our population.

204
00:12:47,412 --> 00:12:47,772
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

205
00:12:48,492 --> 00:12:49,073
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Skerry.

206
00:12:49,638 --> 00:12:55,601
[SPEAKER_09]: Has the guidance office been apprised of any students who received substantial scholarships to go to their schools?

207
00:12:56,161 --> 00:12:56,622
[SPEAKER_13]: Not yet.

208
00:12:56,642 --> 00:13:01,804
[SPEAKER_13]: So they'll fill that information out when they get their graduation caps and gowns, which is mid-May.

209
00:13:02,225 --> 00:13:02,665
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, great.

210
00:13:02,825 --> 00:13:03,005
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

211
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:04,526
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

212
00:13:04,546 --> 00:13:04,986
[SPEAKER_13]: van de Kloot.

213
00:13:05,646 --> 00:13:08,628
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I just, it's always nice to see the list.

214
00:13:08,668 --> 00:13:16,352
[SPEAKER_15]: It's particularly nice to see that we've got a student accepted into Yale this year, because that's a very difficult school to have an acceptance.

215
00:13:16,412 --> 00:13:17,933
[SPEAKER_15]: So I was particularly happy to see

216
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:20,070
[SPEAKER_15]: that a Medford student had made it to Yale.

217
00:13:20,391 --> 00:13:22,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think it's been a while since that's happened.

218
00:13:23,451 --> 00:13:23,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.

219
00:13:23,911 --> 00:13:27,893
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a motion to receive and place on file by Mr. Skerry, seconded by Ms.

220
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:28,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Cunha.

221
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:29,113
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

222
00:13:29,793 --> 00:13:30,493
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

223
00:13:30,533 --> 00:13:31,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

224
00:13:32,134 --> 00:13:32,654
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

225
00:13:32,814 --> 00:13:33,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Ms.

226
00:13:33,254 --> 00:13:33,654
[SPEAKER_05]: Jensen.

227
00:13:34,114 --> 00:13:35,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Report on opiate prevention grant.

228
00:13:36,035 --> 00:13:36,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Superintendent.

229
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:42,296
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we all realize that the opiate issue is becoming very, very substantial.

230
00:13:43,057 --> 00:13:44,197
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been very substantial.

231
00:13:44,217 --> 00:13:48,078
[SPEAKER_00]: The Massachusetts amount of opiate exceeds the national aperture.

232
00:13:49,058 --> 00:13:51,199
[SPEAKER_00]: So for opiate deaths and the like.

233
00:13:51,259 --> 00:13:58,761
[SPEAKER_00]: And it affects marriages, it affects jobs, families, neighborhoods, and all kinds of things out there that are not good.

234
00:14:00,362 --> 00:14:05,563
[SPEAKER_00]: So through the work of Tony and Rachel, we have another grant.

235
00:14:06,184 --> 00:14:10,845
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll let them explain it because I think it's a really good item for us right now.

236
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:11,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.

237
00:14:12,006 --> 00:14:12,086
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

238
00:14:12,526 --> 00:14:13,066
[SPEAKER_05]: Bento?

239
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:16,287
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening, Mayor Burke, Superintendent, and school committee members.

240
00:14:16,921 --> 00:14:20,484
[SPEAKER_11]: Rachel and I are here to talk about the Youth Opioid Prevention Grant.

241
00:14:21,224 --> 00:14:29,991
[SPEAKER_11]: This grant was funded by a settlement with CVS and Walgreen over fraudulent practices around opioid prescriptions.

242
00:14:31,572 --> 00:14:45,663
[SPEAKER_11]: And Attorney General Maura Healey used $500,000 to fund the program, and they were looking for programs that would address the opioid addiction and dependence.

243
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,191
[SPEAKER_11]: programs that would be sustainable.

244
00:14:48,711 --> 00:15:00,336
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're very happy to announce that we were awarded $18,000 for our programs here to augment the many different things we've been doing.

245
00:15:00,396 --> 00:15:07,018
[SPEAKER_11]: But we're really focusing now on building skills, as Rachel will talk about, with our younger elementary students.

246
00:15:09,719 --> 00:15:13,521
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so we're looking to use the grant funding kind of a four-prong approach.

247
00:15:14,681 --> 00:15:16,322
[SPEAKER_01]: First, education of our students.

248
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:22,414
[SPEAKER_01]: education of our faculty, education of our parents, and education of our community.

249
00:15:23,034 --> 00:15:26,457
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing we're looking to do is purchase more Michigan model kits.

250
00:15:26,977 --> 00:15:31,700
[SPEAKER_01]: At this point, we have kits at the elementary schools, but they are shared between the teachers.

251
00:15:32,261 --> 00:15:38,906
[SPEAKER_01]: By using this money, we can purchase one kit for every teacher so that they all have all of their own kits, all of their own information.

252
00:15:39,746 --> 00:15:46,431
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd also like to provide yearly parent education forums about substance use and prevention,

253
00:15:48,308 --> 00:15:54,513
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd also like to do faculty training on identification of substance use, risky behaviors, and preventative strategies.

254
00:15:54,793 --> 00:15:56,774
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be a yearly training that we would offer.

255
00:15:58,175 --> 00:16:09,764
[SPEAKER_01]: Increasing community awareness by having resources for education and student support actually posted on our school website, our health website, that will help people in the community that are looking for information.

256
00:16:09,784 --> 00:16:14,688
[SPEAKER_01]: And then strengthening our partnerships with community organizations.

257
00:16:15,004 --> 00:16:26,046
[SPEAKER_01]: the youth soccer leagues, the youth basketball leagues, working with their coaches to actually teach them some of the information within the Michigan model so they can share it with their athletes and with their parents as well.

258
00:16:27,326 --> 00:16:29,567
[SPEAKER_01]: We will be assessing the program as well.

259
00:16:29,587 --> 00:16:43,869
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to actually start to look at the survey results for the communities that care survey so we can make a comparison 2017 and 2019 to see what we have done, see if it has made a difference within the survey results.

260
00:16:44,568 --> 00:16:46,469
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll also be assessing each program.

261
00:16:46,489 --> 00:16:52,293
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have surveys after each program is done to kind of assess how it went and where we're going from there.

262
00:16:53,914 --> 00:16:56,896
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll also be doing pre and post assessments of the Michigan model.

263
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:58,017
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.

264
00:16:58,117 --> 00:16:58,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent work.

265
00:16:58,977 --> 00:16:59,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

266
00:16:59,318 --> 00:16:59,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.

267
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:02,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Benedetto.

268
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:02,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

269
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,041
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

270
00:17:04,061 --> 00:17:11,546
[SPEAKER_06]: $18,000 towards educational services regarding drug addiction in any way, shape, or form.

271
00:17:11,566 --> 00:17:13,367
[SPEAKER_06]: There's money coming in, and we don't

272
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:21,704
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really happy to see that they've allocated funds throughout the community, and we were recipient of such a large sum.

273
00:17:22,705 --> 00:17:29,488
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to talk to you a little bit about working with Penny from the city side, because she's an amazing, and her department is amazing.

274
00:17:29,588 --> 00:17:31,489
[SPEAKER_05]: They do work very closely now.

275
00:17:31,729 --> 00:17:34,230
[SPEAKER_06]: So she might have some ideas.

276
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:38,652
[SPEAKER_11]: Penny sat on the planning board when we wrote this grant.

277
00:17:38,952 --> 00:17:39,192
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

278
00:17:39,272 --> 00:17:42,594
[SPEAKER_11]: So we were able to listen to her,

279
00:17:43,044 --> 00:17:48,646
[SPEAKER_11]: feedback about it and she was very helpful for us in putting together the application.

280
00:17:49,906 --> 00:17:56,148
[SPEAKER_11]: They also funded our parent forum with Dr. Ruth Poteet that we had a couple weeks ago.

281
00:17:57,268 --> 00:18:01,169
[SPEAKER_11]: So we were very pleased to be able to do that for our community.

282
00:18:02,329 --> 00:18:10,732
[SPEAKER_06]: My other only suggestion is as far as the community piece, we have a group in the community, Method Against Addiction, and it's really well run and well

283
00:18:12,035 --> 00:18:16,776
[SPEAKER_06]: developed and they really have the hands on what's happening in that community.

284
00:18:17,836 --> 00:18:21,217
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would reach out to that group as well.

285
00:18:21,417 --> 00:18:24,638
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they're phenomenal and they're very receptive and very helpful.

286
00:18:25,198 --> 00:18:27,779
[SPEAKER_06]: And my last piece is for the parents.

287
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:33,160
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that Cheryl just received an award from the- Citizen of the Year.

288
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,400
[SPEAKER_06]: Citizen of the Year.

289
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:40,362
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've attended her, I've been to her group to observe what goes on there.

290
00:18:40,762 --> 00:18:41,802
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's for the parents.

291
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:43,671
[SPEAKER_06]: of people who are addicted.

292
00:18:44,071 --> 00:18:45,551
[SPEAKER_06]: And everybody thinks it's the older.

293
00:18:46,032 --> 00:18:50,493
[SPEAKER_06]: It could also be students within our district.

294
00:18:51,114 --> 00:18:54,495
[SPEAKER_06]: And just get that perspective as well.

295
00:18:54,515 --> 00:19:05,660
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're getting both the school, the city side, the great program, Method Against Addiction, which brings people together, make them feel like a family.

296
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:10,482
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're also getting adults that are struggling with, how do I cope with this?

297
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,520
[SPEAKER_06]: type of thing.

298
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:18,123
[SPEAKER_06]: So we could really, you know, unite as one with, I know it's only 18,000, but that's, that's a good amount of money.

299
00:19:18,203 --> 00:19:19,504
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's just some different ideas.

300
00:19:19,584 --> 00:19:27,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause if you do an outreach, speak to the people that you're going to outreach to, the parents, the people in the citizen street, et cetera.

301
00:19:28,445 --> 00:19:28,845
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

302
00:19:29,365 --> 00:19:33,046
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to add a couple of comments that I just heard at the start.

303
00:19:33,386 --> 00:19:35,726
[SPEAKER_05]: It's way beyond a start.

304
00:19:35,866 --> 00:19:40,587
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been spending a lot of money, a lot of commitment to this topic from a city perspective.

305
00:19:41,027 --> 00:19:52,650
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that Penny and her team, there's quite a few that are part of her team now, and they do outreach, they do coaching, they connect people with beds if need be to get them in for treatment, and the post.

306
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,510
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a lot going on.

307
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:58,914
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you've been working closely with them as it is, so keep up the good work.

308
00:19:58,934 --> 00:19:59,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

309
00:19:59,294 --> 00:20:00,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

310
00:20:00,554 --> 00:20:01,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Good grant.

311
00:20:01,195 --> 00:20:01,735
[SPEAKER_06]: One more thing.

312
00:20:02,055 --> 00:20:03,895
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, sorry.

313
00:20:04,535 --> 00:20:05,716
[SPEAKER_06]: Can she just finish?

314
00:20:06,836 --> 00:20:20,420
[SPEAKER_06]: So I also, uh, about two years ago, the governor had, um, people come out to the community and I went to a few of the meetings, um, they were in Somerville and they were trying to figure out what the state needed to do as a team and they,

315
00:20:21,028 --> 00:20:28,696
[SPEAKER_06]: They were talking about mandates for schools and stuff and I rose my hand and I was like, are they going to be funded mandates or are they going to be burdened to the cities?

316
00:20:29,217 --> 00:20:32,440
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was assured that of course they would be funded mandates.

317
00:20:32,837 --> 00:20:34,738
[SPEAKER_06]: But I haven't seen those mandates yet.

318
00:20:34,758 --> 00:20:38,360
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was wondering if the superintendent had gotten any mandates yet from.

319
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:39,701
[SPEAKER_06]: Funded mandates.

320
00:20:40,461 --> 00:20:42,422
[SPEAKER_06]: Or unfunded.

321
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:47,305
[SPEAKER_00]: The word fun is not really a good way to begin the word funded.

322
00:20:47,445 --> 00:20:48,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Or even unfunded.

323
00:20:48,386 --> 00:20:50,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Are there any new mandates within the school district?

324
00:20:50,807 --> 00:20:51,667
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be several.

325
00:20:51,707 --> 00:20:52,828
[SPEAKER_06]: But they haven't come out yet.

326
00:20:52,888 --> 00:20:53,588
[SPEAKER_06]: The governor was doing.

327
00:20:53,608 --> 00:20:55,249
[SPEAKER_00]: They're starting to emerge right now.

328
00:20:55,329 --> 00:20:59,792
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think the biggest thing you have to understand is a lot of things coming out, but they're always underfunded.

329
00:21:00,531 --> 00:21:01,392
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?

330
00:21:01,412 --> 00:21:04,754
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a few dollars put to them, but then there's not enough to really carry them out.

331
00:21:04,794 --> 00:21:07,735
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see some of the budget report that we're going to talk about.

332
00:21:08,276 --> 00:21:08,496
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

333
00:21:08,536 --> 00:21:12,778
[SPEAKER_11]: And I mean, one of them recently was the expert screening that the training was funded for.

334
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:23,485
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, but we were able to conduct the screening at no cost to the district, just using our resources that we have in the health services and guidance counseling, um, departments.

335
00:21:24,123 --> 00:21:24,983
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good.

336
00:21:25,003 --> 00:21:25,203
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

337
00:21:25,323 --> 00:21:25,924
[SPEAKER_07]: Van de Kloot.

338
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:31,665
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to thank you both for writing the grant.

339
00:21:31,725 --> 00:21:34,546
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to, since you mentioned her,

340
00:21:51,222 --> 00:21:59,764
[SPEAKER_15]: that I know Mrs. Kretz and myself were able to attend Dr. Ruth Pote's talk, which was just exceptional.

341
00:22:00,324 --> 00:22:05,645
[SPEAKER_15]: Everybody in the audience who, and I've talked to people since, have said it was one of the best things that they've attended.

342
00:22:06,065 --> 00:22:09,165
[SPEAKER_15]: I hope that at some point we might be able to bring her back again.

343
00:22:09,765 --> 00:22:14,426
[SPEAKER_15]: She truly was, it was a wonderful event and I'm so glad that I was able to attend.

344
00:22:14,926 --> 00:22:15,286
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

345
00:22:15,326 --> 00:22:16,227
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm glad you enjoyed it.

346
00:22:17,427 --> 00:22:17,587
[SPEAKER_12]: Ms.

347
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:17,867
[SPEAKER_12]: Kretz.

348
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:23,484
[SPEAKER_12]: I wanted to mention that I went to the forum, you know, with Paula and I, and it was just amazing.

349
00:22:23,544 --> 00:22:24,965
[SPEAKER_12]: And she was a great, great speaker.

350
00:22:25,025 --> 00:22:26,826
[SPEAKER_12]: And everybody was so engaged.

351
00:22:26,886 --> 00:22:27,627
[SPEAKER_12]: It was wonderful.

352
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,408
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a great grant.

353
00:22:29,488 --> 00:22:30,449
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just terrific.

354
00:22:31,509 --> 00:22:38,514
[SPEAKER_12]: And I love how there's going to be more parent forums and more facility training, increased community awareness.

355
00:22:39,635 --> 00:22:45,119
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just wanted to make sure, because I know when the original grant was written, the expenses added up to $20,000.

356
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:46,320
[SPEAKER_12]: So I wanted to make sure that

357
00:22:48,057 --> 00:23:00,726
[SPEAKER_12]: there was going to be enough funding available, or if you had to add something to the budget this year, so that you could continue with the new teacher training and prevention, the presentations.

358
00:23:01,566 --> 00:23:08,011
[SPEAKER_12]: I wasn't sure if, you know, was this like kind of a little bit of an estimate, or do you think you'll find out?

359
00:23:08,311 --> 00:23:11,913
[SPEAKER_11]: No, this is the grant, the total that we will receive.

360
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:16,256
[SPEAKER_11]: But we looked through, and we were able to slim down on some administrative costs.

361
00:23:17,996 --> 00:23:23,384
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I just want to make sure that you get to put through everything that you want to put through because it's so wonderful.

362
00:23:23,844 --> 00:23:30,834
[SPEAKER_11]: The most important piece of it, the Michigan model kits we kept because that really starts building the foundation at the kindergarten level.

363
00:23:32,738 --> 00:23:40,563
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to say again, as my colleagues have said, thank you for your hard work and for getting us this grant.

364
00:23:41,403 --> 00:23:44,765
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that you have collaborated with different organizations.

365
00:23:45,086 --> 00:23:57,754
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just curious in knowing, I know that the city council has their meetings once a month with the police chief and the police department, and they're going from one community, well, one part of our city to another.

366
00:23:58,134 --> 00:23:59,035
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was just curious if

367
00:23:59,575 --> 00:24:05,118
[SPEAKER_03]: If it was something that you guys have ever attended, maybe just to get the word out of when you're going to have a parent meeting?

368
00:24:06,638 --> 00:24:08,059
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

369
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:13,081
[SPEAKER_11]: We attended and did a presentation a couple of years ago at a city council meeting.

370
00:24:14,782 --> 00:24:21,866
[SPEAKER_11]: I also attend a monthly National Alliance of Mental Illness meeting that is held at the police station.

371
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:24,967
[SPEAKER_11]: So we share a lot of ideas at that monthly meeting.

372
00:24:25,767 --> 00:24:28,849
[SPEAKER_11]: Stacey Shulman also attends with me from the school side.

373
00:24:29,445 --> 00:24:34,727
[SPEAKER_03]: This wasn't necessarily just to show it to the city council, but where they're having their meetings in the different sections of the city.

374
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:45,492
[SPEAKER_03]: I know your schedules are, you know, they're piled as it is, but just to like, you don't have to stay there the whole night, but just to get the word out, maybe when they do have their meetings of giving them

375
00:24:46,154 --> 00:25:00,339
[SPEAKER_03]: the information of what you're working on, maybe the next time you are having a parent meeting, or when you're scheduling a yearly meeting, just to, even if you could bring a flyer, or just give it to the chief and have him bring it to those meetings, just to get the word out again.

376
00:25:01,747 --> 00:25:08,313
[SPEAKER_05]: The police chief has been having community meetings the first Wednesday of every month, ongoing for years and years and years.

377
00:25:08,353 --> 00:25:12,097
[SPEAKER_05]: What he's done differently now is he's actually going into the neighborhoods to host them.

378
00:25:12,698 --> 00:25:18,363
[SPEAKER_05]: So people, a little more localized, but I believe it's Wednesday night at 6 at the senior center.

379
00:25:18,523 --> 00:25:20,365
[SPEAKER_03]: This week it's going to be tomorrow night.

380
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:21,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Senior center at 6, Wednesday.

381
00:25:21,967 --> 00:25:22,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Wednesday.

382
00:25:22,367 --> 00:25:23,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Today's Tuesday.

383
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:23,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

384
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:24,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

385
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:30,134
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, a motion to receive this report and place on file by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Ms.

386
00:25:30,174 --> 00:25:30,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Kretz.

387
00:25:30,494 --> 00:25:31,315
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

388
00:25:31,695 --> 00:25:31,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

389
00:25:31,935 --> 00:25:32,676
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

390
00:25:32,896 --> 00:25:33,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

391
00:25:34,578 --> 00:25:38,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Recommendation to approve school committee meeting schedule for the school year 17-18.

392
00:25:39,181 --> 00:25:40,122
[SPEAKER_05]: Superintendent.

393
00:25:41,183 --> 00:25:42,044
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in front of you.

394
00:25:42,084 --> 00:25:43,245
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a standard schedule.

395
00:25:44,346 --> 00:25:47,128
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a motion on the floor for approval, seconded by Ms.

396
00:25:47,168 --> 00:25:47,728
[SPEAKER_05]: Mustone.

397
00:25:48,989 --> 00:25:49,430
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call.

398
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:00,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

399
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,281
[SPEAKER_05]: 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

400
00:26:02,321 --> 00:26:03,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

401
00:26:04,122 --> 00:26:06,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Recommendation to reject school choice for year 17-18.

402
00:26:06,824 --> 00:26:10,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion for approval by Ms.

403
00:26:10,426 --> 00:26:11,467
[SPEAKER_05]: Vanden Heuvel, seconded by Ms.

404
00:26:11,507 --> 00:26:11,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Cuno.

405
00:26:12,888 --> 00:26:13,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call.

406
00:26:14,609 --> 00:26:15,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call vote, please.

407
00:26:24,107 --> 00:26:25,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

408
00:26:25,888 --> 00:26:26,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

409
00:26:27,809 --> 00:26:30,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Report on TechEdge technology study.

410
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:31,330
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Superintendent.

411
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:44,654
[SPEAKER_00]: So this report we commissioned earlier this year to get us a robust look at our network and all the infrastructure that's necessary to support the expanded use of technology in the schools.

412
00:26:44,754 --> 00:26:47,655
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you have is, I think, a very thorough report.

413
00:26:48,476 --> 00:26:49,376
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives us

414
00:26:50,158 --> 00:26:54,919
[SPEAKER_00]: some pathways to pursue and strengthen our capacities to use technology efficiently.

415
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:00,201
[SPEAKER_00]: It also enables us to access our tier two funding in support of upgrades.

416
00:27:01,341 --> 00:27:04,542
[SPEAKER_00]: These reports, as I mentioned, are very technical and extensive.

417
00:27:05,542 --> 00:27:16,606
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're provided to you so that you can take your time to go through them and perhaps develop a deeper understanding of the complexity it will take to integrate technology into our programs in the public schools.

418
00:27:18,863 --> 00:27:23,885
[SPEAKER_00]: The recommendations provide several key steps that we can take without a burdensome cost.

419
00:27:23,905 --> 00:27:25,385
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these things are just doable.

420
00:27:25,505 --> 00:27:26,385
[SPEAKER_00]: We just have to do them.

421
00:27:27,166 --> 00:27:33,988
[SPEAKER_00]: And still, it's important for us to recognize that there are heavy requirements of testing, state reporting, electronic data management.

422
00:27:34,248 --> 00:27:39,489
[SPEAKER_00]: Communication requires we have finely tuned, robust, and reliable capacity to meet our obligations.

423
00:27:39,549 --> 00:27:48,072
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, well, it's not part of this report, some staffing that has to be done so that we can maintain these systems the way we need to.

424
00:27:48,857 --> 00:27:50,138
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a one-time thing.

425
00:27:50,899 --> 00:27:51,339
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do it.

426
00:27:51,379 --> 00:28:04,189
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be with us for a while in terms of the infrastructure, but there'll be many upgrades that will always be required as more things are added and more people are trying to do things and more devices are played with.

427
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:06,630
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a very, very good investment.

428
00:28:07,451 --> 00:28:15,157
[SPEAKER_00]: So I recommend, first of all, that you would read the executive summaries because that gives you enough of a background to understand what's being involved.

429
00:28:15,998 --> 00:28:21,860
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, you'll find some materials that talk about the category two E-rate funding estimates.

430
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:30,362
[SPEAKER_00]: And under this program, we can access $398,100 of federal funds with a $265,000, $400 match.

431
00:28:32,402 --> 00:28:35,543
[SPEAKER_00]: We're currently soliciting bids and completing E-rate applications.

432
00:28:36,543 --> 00:28:41,305
[SPEAKER_00]: We will seek capital funding to meet this infrastructure need in the weeks ahead.

433
00:28:43,518 --> 00:28:51,020
[SPEAKER_00]: It's clear that other things need to be done in terms of devices and equipment, but that's not part of this particular activity.

434
00:28:52,740 --> 00:29:03,243
[SPEAKER_00]: If we don't do it this year, I have a feeling some of this stuff may not be available to school systems or libraries next year because of some of the domestic cutbacks that are being considered in Washington.

435
00:29:04,143 --> 00:29:06,443
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd like to act on this now.

436
00:29:06,543 --> 00:29:11,605
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to let you know that we're working actively on this.

437
00:29:11,885 --> 00:29:13,285
[SPEAKER_00]: Christine is working closely.

438
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:22,406
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, on the financial part and on the technical part as well with Steve Kelly of tech edge and, uh, look forward to moving this forward.

439
00:29:22,926 --> 00:29:28,290
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy to take any questions and Christine's here as well.

440
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:43,240
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, that I had, um, an opportunity to review this report in detail and I did look at all of the, uh, findings and although there was much that I didn't understand as, as a novice in this area, there were other parts that just make common sense as they were talking about,

441
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:57,779
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, areas where all of a sudden it would get too crowded, if you would, and somehow or another it just seemed one of the most comprehensive and clearly it's something we need to move ahead on.

442
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:02,242
[SPEAKER_15]: Is the next appropriate step to have a committee of the whole to review this?

443
00:30:03,122 --> 00:30:04,463
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we can do that if you want.

444
00:30:04,723 --> 00:30:05,264
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we need to?

445
00:30:05,284 --> 00:30:10,807
[SPEAKER_00]: We certainly, you know, want to move forward because, you know, we want to be able to file our applications and

446
00:30:11,285 --> 00:30:12,946
[SPEAKER_00]: and take advantage of bids that are out there.

447
00:30:12,986 --> 00:30:14,867
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want to come into the hall, we can schedule it.

448
00:30:14,907 --> 00:30:24,211
[SPEAKER_00]: We do are going to have a very busy schedule in the month of May and early June because of a number of things, including school council reports and the like, but happy to schedule it if this is what you want to do.

449
00:30:24,451 --> 00:30:28,773
[SPEAKER_15]: Personally, I'm comfortable with just moving at authorizing the administration to move ahead.

450
00:30:29,193 --> 00:30:39,297
[SPEAKER_05]: If my colleagues are, we would still have to come back for a formal vote in any case and then send it for an appropriation paper to the city council.

451
00:30:40,718 --> 00:30:40,838
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

452
00:30:41,299 --> 00:30:41,980
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a motion?

453
00:30:43,802 --> 00:30:44,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Benedetto.

454
00:30:45,363 --> 00:30:46,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

455
00:30:47,646 --> 00:30:52,551
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is the recommendation that we have to move forward.

456
00:30:52,731 --> 00:30:56,274
[SPEAKER_06]: And if we move forward with this, we would need to receive $265,400 match.

457
00:30:56,294 --> 00:30:57,335
[SPEAKER_06]: And we would get close to $400,000.

458
00:30:57,416 --> 00:30:57,816
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

459
00:30:57,836 --> 00:30:57,936
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

460
00:31:04,242 --> 00:31:14,444
[SPEAKER_06]: I also would like to know what we're budgeting in addition to this on an annual basis to make sure that we're also making a commitment on a line item in our budget as well.

461
00:31:14,744 --> 00:31:23,906
[SPEAKER_06]: Because this, like we did the $3 million bond a few years ago for technology and then we had a few slow years and then we're asking for more.

462
00:31:24,246 --> 00:31:32,027
[SPEAKER_06]: What I'd like to see is a commitment to technology throughout our system throughout every year so that way we don't, you know,

463
00:31:32,673 --> 00:31:36,854
[SPEAKER_06]: when these opportunities arise, it's for bonus stuff, not the everyday stuff.

464
00:31:37,474 --> 00:31:40,215
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you understand what I'm saying, superintendent?

465
00:31:40,575 --> 00:31:49,037
[SPEAKER_00]: So what our plans are internally, of course, we're still refining them somewhat because we still have to figure out how much money is available to us operationally.

466
00:31:49,517 --> 00:32:00,380
[SPEAKER_00]: But we will plan to buy devices with a regular budget in addition to some of the other things we've typically done, because in order to use the network, you have to have more devices.

467
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:02,851
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably a lot of Chromebooks.

468
00:32:02,871 --> 00:32:06,974
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see this in the school council reports.

469
00:32:07,014 --> 00:32:08,134
[SPEAKER_00]: People are asking for these things.

470
00:32:08,154 --> 00:32:09,015
[SPEAKER_00]: We need them for testing.

471
00:32:09,055 --> 00:32:09,975
[SPEAKER_00]: We need them for reporting.

472
00:32:09,995 --> 00:32:12,057
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few other devices we will need.

473
00:32:12,637 --> 00:32:15,579
[SPEAKER_00]: But the infrastructure is something that we can bond.

474
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:18,461
[SPEAKER_00]: And the infrastructure is something that we can get E-rate money for.

475
00:32:18,521 --> 00:32:25,946
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we need to really go after right now, because that's money that we wouldn't typically put in an operating budget.

476
00:32:26,446 --> 00:32:29,168
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, you'll see substantial dollars

477
00:32:29,775 --> 00:32:31,696
[SPEAKER_00]: put to this, plus there's also some staff needs.

478
00:32:32,276 --> 00:32:35,657
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to have to try and put that in place and work that around as well.

479
00:32:37,277 --> 00:32:37,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

480
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:37,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Cuno.

481
00:32:38,497 --> 00:32:38,717
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

482
00:32:38,737 --> 00:32:39,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Just point of clarification.

483
00:32:39,978 --> 00:32:41,698
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to make sure that I'm understanding this.

484
00:32:42,138 --> 00:32:47,380
[SPEAKER_03]: So the 265.4, that comes out of, that will come out of the capital plan money.

485
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,580
[SPEAKER_03]: That does not touch the budget.

486
00:32:49,921 --> 00:32:50,761
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the plan.

487
00:32:50,961 --> 00:32:53,181
[SPEAKER_00]: Christine, did you want to come up and comment on any of these things?

488
00:32:53,201 --> 00:32:55,342
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's financial stuff that she's working closely with.

489
00:32:59,370 --> 00:32:59,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

490
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:10,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, just also a clarification that we are in the process of reviewing the major procurements that are involved with the E-Rate Priority 2 funding.

491
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:15,043
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a substantial process of which we have a federal deadline of May 11th.

492
00:33:15,443 --> 00:33:24,110
[SPEAKER_02]: So timing is of great importance in this particular case to make sure that we can maximize their major matching funding piece.

493
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:26,752
[SPEAKER_02]: What we have on our procurement

494
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:33,875
[SPEAKER_02]: are the infrastructure switches, the major firewalls, and all of the wireless access points throughout the entire district.

495
00:33:34,415 --> 00:33:45,824
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are looking at analyzing the best case scenarios that we can utilize the funds and or maximize what the contribution will be.

496
00:33:45,944 --> 00:33:55,371
[SPEAKER_02]: So some of our bids are coming in, well, they were much better than they had been projected out from a rough calculation.

497
00:33:56,323 --> 00:34:01,864
[SPEAKER_02]: The competitive process is definitely very good in terms of getting best pricing.

498
00:34:02,244 --> 00:34:18,247
[SPEAKER_02]: We are seeing that based on the quantities that are needed and the level of extensions and infrastructure renovations that we're looking at do cause a couple of overages in certain categories.

499
00:34:18,607 --> 00:34:22,408
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are still in the process of having that final analysis done.

500
00:34:22,768 --> 00:34:26,109
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting clarifications back from the vendors as well.

501
00:34:26,691 --> 00:34:34,535
[SPEAKER_02]: So although this is an estimated figure, I would advise that we do not hang our hat on this exact number at this point in time.

502
00:34:35,675 --> 00:34:36,916
[SPEAKER_05]: When is the application due?

503
00:34:37,896 --> 00:34:38,277
[SPEAKER_02]: May 11th.

504
00:34:38,317 --> 00:34:46,000
[SPEAKER_02]: May 11th in terms of what we would be identifying as our project in terms of going forward with the funding.

505
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Not funding approval.

506
00:34:47,401 --> 00:34:47,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.

507
00:34:48,041 --> 00:34:55,965
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not a commitment to actual the purchasing and procurement process, but it is saying that

508
00:34:56,452 --> 00:34:57,493
[SPEAKER_02]: to the federal government.

509
00:34:57,533 --> 00:35:07,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we are identifying that this is a priority and we anticipate in fiscal year 18 to provide X, Y, Z amount for this purpose.

510
00:35:07,501 --> 00:35:10,123
[SPEAKER_03]: So when would the deadline be after this?

511
00:35:10,683 --> 00:35:14,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if we have May 11th, we have, okay, everything goes through.

512
00:35:14,626 --> 00:35:18,649
[SPEAKER_03]: This is us just basically saying that we are interested in this.

513
00:35:18,669 --> 00:35:19,570
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what we want to do.

514
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:20,871
[SPEAKER_03]: When is the deadline?

515
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:25,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I just want to make sure we have plenty of time to come back to the board here

516
00:35:26,523 --> 00:35:32,967
[SPEAKER_03]: and take the vote the proper way and make sure that you have enough time to get all the information you need.

517
00:35:33,408 --> 00:35:35,949
[SPEAKER_03]: But if I'm not mistaken, we also have to go to the city council.

518
00:35:36,229 --> 00:35:40,252
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just don't want to have another fiasco at the last, not, not that we're doing it.

519
00:35:40,552 --> 00:35:42,333
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying, I don't want to hear another fiasco.

520
00:35:42,573 --> 00:35:44,034
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's, let's go over this now.

521
00:35:44,114 --> 00:35:44,415
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

522
00:35:44,795 --> 00:35:50,779
[SPEAKER_00]: The federal government, we put this report in, we put an E-rate, you know, a funding request in every year, the general E-rate.

523
00:35:50,819 --> 00:35:51,739
[SPEAKER_00]: This is tier two.

524
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:53,660
[SPEAKER_00]: Tier one, we generally get 50 to $60,000.

525
00:35:53,761 --> 00:35:56,022
[SPEAKER_00]: It's changed a little bit because of the,

526
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:58,719
[SPEAKER_00]: change from telecommunications to other things.

527
00:35:58,759 --> 00:36:01,279
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally, that's independent of this, okay?

528
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:08,561
[SPEAKER_00]: Tier 2 is a special infrastructure type funding that's designed to give us more robust capability.

529
00:36:09,201 --> 00:36:16,123
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll put this in on May 11th, and then we've got to wait for the federal government to actually formally approve it, okay?

530
00:36:16,663 --> 00:36:24,765
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, if we don't put it in on May 11th, and we don't put this in, we won't be eligible to ask for the money later on.

531
00:36:24,845 --> 00:36:26,385
[SPEAKER_00]: So the actual spending

532
00:36:26,821 --> 00:36:31,325
[SPEAKER_00]: process will take place after we have a more, more of a discussion on the details.

533
00:36:31,905 --> 00:36:32,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is fine.

534
00:36:32,486 --> 00:36:33,607
[SPEAKER_03]: And I totally understand that.

535
00:36:33,647 --> 00:36:42,274
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just trying to figure out how much time though we have from May 11th to the actual time that we have to hold patent until we hear back from the federal government.

536
00:36:42,434 --> 00:36:45,196
[SPEAKER_05]: We could go in with an estimate to the council to get the bulk.

537
00:36:45,516 --> 00:36:48,219
[SPEAKER_05]: We could do that if we wanted to just secure it.

538
00:36:48,399 --> 00:36:48,819
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.

539
00:36:48,859 --> 00:36:50,000
[SPEAKER_02]: A little earlier than later.

540
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:50,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.

541
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:54,704
[SPEAKER_02]: So that we could actually have the work and service done.

542
00:36:55,331 --> 00:36:57,793
[SPEAKER_02]: identified and ready to go forward.

543
00:36:57,813 --> 00:36:57,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

544
00:36:58,053 --> 00:37:02,716
[SPEAKER_03]: If I'm not mistaken, it has to be done also before the budget is, oh no, because there's nothing to do with it.

545
00:37:02,796 --> 00:37:03,637
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize for that.

546
00:37:03,697 --> 00:37:09,800
[SPEAKER_00]: You just want to get an authorization to move forward if you can, because otherwise you lose the opportunity to access it.

547
00:37:10,141 --> 00:37:17,085
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm willing to bet, not willing to bet, but I think it's a pretty good bet that this funding will start to disappear with the next federal budget.

548
00:37:18,046 --> 00:37:22,048
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think if we don't act, we won't have this opportunity.

549
00:37:23,129 --> 00:37:23,289
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

550
00:37:23,309 --> 00:37:23,709
[SPEAKER_14]: Mustone.

551
00:37:25,031 --> 00:37:31,577
[SPEAKER_14]: On page 16 from the back, I think it's the easiest way to see it from the back page 16 from the back.

552
00:37:32,117 --> 00:37:32,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

553
00:37:33,078 --> 00:37:39,023
[SPEAKER_14]: So in under traffic to and from different schools, I'd list our schools and devices.

554
00:37:41,465 --> 00:37:42,846
[SPEAKER_14]: Those are handheld devices.

555
00:37:43,226 --> 00:37:48,231
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have high school, three 11 Andrews, two 39 Brooks, 95 Columbus, 82 McGlynn, six 93 and Roberts 99.

556
00:37:52,748 --> 00:37:57,494
[SPEAKER_14]: So what accounts for such a drastic difference in the number of devices at schools?

557
00:37:57,674 --> 00:37:58,415
[SPEAKER_00]: People using.

558
00:37:59,276 --> 00:38:00,758
[SPEAKER_00]: It's used.

559
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:04,162
[SPEAKER_00]: Some places will be more technologically involved than other places.

560
00:38:04,362 --> 00:38:10,210
[SPEAKER_14]: Right, but we've always heard that the Andrews was like our IT school to go to, but this is Sabbath and McGlynn.

561
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:11,972
[SPEAKER_00]: McGlynn is two schools in one, remember?

562
00:38:13,049 --> 00:38:18,073
[SPEAKER_14]: So even if we cut it in half, it still seems like it's substantially more.

563
00:38:18,153 --> 00:38:19,154
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, just the way it is.

564
00:38:19,234 --> 00:38:20,855
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, some places use technology.

565
00:38:21,475 --> 00:38:24,818
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the traffic for a snapshot in time.

566
00:38:25,038 --> 00:38:26,419
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not in totality.

567
00:38:26,659 --> 00:38:29,061
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was a day of monitoring.

568
00:38:29,321 --> 00:38:32,703
[SPEAKER_02]: So not all of your devices would be on in one particular day.

569
00:38:32,783 --> 00:38:35,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Not all of them would be captured for every single school.

570
00:38:35,966 --> 00:38:41,490
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't think that that's a clear delineation that that's the number of devices

571
00:38:42,122 --> 00:38:44,042
[SPEAKER_02]: period in each of those schools.

572
00:38:44,382 --> 00:38:50,704
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what was captured on the activity for the log that they were monitoring the traffic across the Internet connections.

573
00:38:51,264 --> 00:38:52,904
[SPEAKER_14]: Is anyone else shocked, though?

574
00:38:52,964 --> 00:38:58,765
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm assuming that we took a snapshot at about the same time at each school, right?

575
00:38:58,805 --> 00:39:01,906
[SPEAKER_14]: People work—they probably worked 7 to 3 in school hours.

576
00:39:02,526 --> 00:39:09,367
[SPEAKER_14]: So, as a parent who's now worried about kids and their device usage at school as well as home, it seems

577
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:12,831
[SPEAKER_14]: So the percentage-wise goes from 1% to 67%.

578
00:39:13,912 --> 00:39:15,913
[SPEAKER_14]: That seems like a red flag.

579
00:39:15,973 --> 00:39:18,074
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm not an IT person, so I don't know what I'm missing.

580
00:39:19,395 --> 00:39:22,016
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we're talking about a snapshot in time.

581
00:39:22,496 --> 00:39:27,018
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about an attempt to find out the capacity of the network to handle traffic.

582
00:39:27,659 --> 00:39:29,900
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was done on a few days here and there.

583
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:36,043
[SPEAKER_00]: It can't be done every day, because obviously we'd be paying a lot of money for a study that would happen every day.

584
00:39:36,688 --> 00:39:38,529
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just happens this is what's coming through.

585
00:39:38,589 --> 00:39:45,974
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gives us an idea of what traffic would look like on maybe a normal day, but maybe it doesn't totally reflect every day.

586
00:39:45,994 --> 00:39:48,676
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks really low for the most part, besides the McGlynn.

587
00:39:48,696 --> 00:39:49,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Something's missing.

588
00:39:49,296 --> 00:39:50,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of information, Ms.

589
00:39:51,598 --> 00:39:51,818
[SPEAKER_05]: Pugno.

590
00:40:11,513 --> 00:40:13,014
[SPEAKER_03]: happen that day, but it could be a possibility.

591
00:40:14,215 --> 00:40:17,618
[SPEAKER_05]: But even the high school 7% looks tremendously low.

592
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:19,920
[SPEAKER_14]: Could we talk to the TechEdge people?

593
00:40:20,361 --> 00:40:21,341
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

594
00:40:21,381 --> 00:40:23,543
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get some comment on that, and they'll follow me.

595
00:40:23,563 --> 00:40:31,750
[SPEAKER_14]: Because then on page 8 from the beginning, finding one, that we're paying internet connection at the high school and at the McGlen.

596
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:39,517
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know that I have heard at the Andrews, it's very slow, their connection a lot of days.

597
00:40:40,128 --> 00:40:42,571
[SPEAKER_14]: So why isn't a finding for the Andrews as well?

598
00:40:42,892 --> 00:40:45,455
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess it would have been helpful to have a Tech Edge person here.

599
00:40:45,535 --> 00:40:47,378
[SPEAKER_14]: So we can bring them in.

600
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,521
[SPEAKER_05]: That might be easier.

601
00:40:49,541 --> 00:40:51,924
[SPEAKER_05]: Bring them to a school committee meeting versus a committee in the hall.

602
00:40:52,645 --> 00:40:53,286
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that'd be great.

603
00:40:53,306 --> 00:40:53,827
[SPEAKER_14]: We can do that.

604
00:40:54,207 --> 00:40:57,592
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to table the report until Tech Edge can come in.

605
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

606
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:05,423
[SPEAKER_14]: They already did without us.

607
00:41:06,804 --> 00:41:09,746
[SPEAKER_05]: Christine, do you want a formal vote to submit?

608
00:41:09,786 --> 00:41:10,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it's a good idea.

609
00:41:10,866 --> 00:41:11,246
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

610
00:41:11,286 --> 00:41:15,169
[SPEAKER_04]: So that we can move forward with the federal deadline.

611
00:41:15,209 --> 00:41:18,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a motion to submit a formal request to the federal government?

612
00:41:19,191 --> 00:41:19,651
[SPEAKER_05]: So moved.

613
00:41:20,212 --> 00:41:20,952
[SPEAKER_05]: So moved by Ms.

614
00:41:20,992 --> 00:41:22,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Vanden Heuvel, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

615
00:41:22,673 --> 00:41:23,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call.

616
00:41:33,205 --> 00:41:34,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

617
00:41:35,005 --> 00:41:35,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

618
00:41:35,845 --> 00:41:36,565
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Kirsten.

619
00:41:37,966 --> 00:41:39,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Pre-budget report, building and grounds.

620
00:41:40,486 --> 00:41:41,967
[SPEAKER_00]: So, John, where are you?

621
00:41:43,967 --> 00:41:49,588
[SPEAKER_14]: Now appearing on our stage, John.

622
00:41:50,809 --> 00:41:56,670
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, buildings and grounds obviously is a big area for us.

623
00:41:57,567 --> 00:42:03,450
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, you have a lot of interest in this and I just want to comment before John talks about his specifics.

624
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:16,937
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, as I told you in a prior meeting that it's my intent to augment the building repair of mine by 200,000, which would then be distributed among the schools for the various projects that we've all been talking about.

625
00:42:17,517 --> 00:42:21,459
[SPEAKER_00]: Because quite frankly, the budget that we have will get used up for,

626
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:28,651
[SPEAKER_00]: general maintenance and it will be used up for things that, you know, go boom in the night.

627
00:42:29,212 --> 00:42:34,413
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would give us some flexibility in doing some of the repairs.

628
00:42:34,473 --> 00:42:51,997
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the major piece for the high school, we want to see where the SOI takes us, you know, and there's some other aspects of the high school which John will address, but the SOI is what we submitted to the MSBA and see where that goes because obviously if we get money from them, you know, that's going to be a

629
00:42:52,833 --> 00:42:56,095
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot bigger amount than we would be able to fund ourselves internally.

630
00:42:56,575 --> 00:43:01,418
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot going on, but I wanted to have a chance to take a look at some of the things moving through this area.

631
00:43:01,979 --> 00:43:03,760
[SPEAKER_00]: And John, you have your copy of your report?

632
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:04,120
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

633
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:09,083
[SPEAKER_00]: So why don't you talk a little bit about what's in your report and I'll be happy to augment it as we go.

634
00:43:09,103 --> 00:43:09,363
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Benedetto.

635
00:43:09,383 --> 00:43:17,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Galston, the $200,000 that you're adding to the budget this year, is that going to be annually from this point on?

636
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:18,989
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't know.

637
00:43:19,009 --> 00:43:20,970
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we have to sit down and have that discussion.

638
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:22,011
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, I think that,

639
00:43:22,652 --> 00:43:31,599
[SPEAKER_00]: particular line item should grow, whether it should grow $200,000, $300,000, or $150,000 is something we can look at.

640
00:43:31,999 --> 00:43:35,682
[SPEAKER_00]: It also depends to some degree on what else we can get funding for.

641
00:43:36,243 --> 00:43:43,548
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the concept is to put a few more dollars in this thing so we can address very specific topics that you have an interest in.

642
00:43:44,589 --> 00:43:52,255
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can do it with assurance rather than have to wait to see how many things go bum in the night, which we have to deal with emergency funding.

643
00:43:53,115 --> 00:44:12,472
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we did got a couple of pipes like this year and be here before and so on so forth So it would give us more flexibility, but how much that really depends on you know the projects we identify and where we go with it Mr. McLaughlin good evening mayor Burke superintendent Dawson committee so our district is 1.1 to 1.2 million square feet

644
00:44:16,798 --> 00:44:17,458
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're busy.

645
00:44:17,619 --> 00:44:19,079
[SPEAKER_10]: We're very busy at all times.

646
00:44:19,259 --> 00:44:23,922
[SPEAKER_10]: We take, uh, we take a lot of work orders, um, a lot of requests.

647
00:44:24,902 --> 00:44:43,272
[SPEAKER_10]: And, um, this year we were busy at Medford high school with, uh, a building pipe replacement, which was, um, something that we had hoped to take on with the capital plan, but it just, uh, so happened that we, we had to make the repairs and, um,

648
00:44:44,673 --> 00:44:59,284
[SPEAKER_10]: Mayor Burke has come up with the money to replace the front doors up in Medford High School and door 31, that's the pool door, which is gonna be a big improvement, especially where we have the new studio vestibule and matching everything up.

649
00:44:59,324 --> 00:45:11,874
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think we're gonna look into probably some signage too for the main entrance of Medford High School, because I think that sometimes it can be a little confusing for people when they do come to the entrance.

650
00:45:11,914 --> 00:45:13,635
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that the signage is something

651
00:45:14,347 --> 00:45:21,248
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that we can probably work with the vocational school to get something done that would be appropriate.

652
00:45:22,509 --> 00:45:24,829
[SPEAKER_10]: And everybody's had a chance to read the report.

653
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:27,369
[SPEAKER_10]: If there's any questions, I'd be happy to answer them.

654
00:45:29,410 --> 00:45:29,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

655
00:45:29,650 --> 00:45:30,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Mustone.

656
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:41,232
[SPEAKER_14]: And I also want to thank Carolyn Montello, a mom from the Brooks, who had reached out to me with some great ideas about how to improve the

657
00:45:41,749 --> 00:45:47,633
[SPEAKER_14]: facade of the high school, and we had the opportunity to meet with John and the mayor at different times, and Mr. Belson.

658
00:45:48,313 --> 00:45:57,359
[SPEAKER_14]: So one concern was the pool door that whacks you when you walk in, and the staircase about trying to make that look better.

659
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:00,041
[SPEAKER_14]: And you had mentioned that you would try to get a quote for us?

660
00:46:00,362 --> 00:46:00,662
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

661
00:46:00,762 --> 00:46:07,686
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I've been in discussions with Superintendent Belson, and we're trying to come up with a plan.

662
00:46:07,726 --> 00:46:09,868
[SPEAKER_10]: I have received a couple of quotes.

663
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:16,402
[SPEAKER_10]: So it'll just be a decision process whether we decide to move forward on it.

664
00:46:17,183 --> 00:46:18,583
[SPEAKER_10]: I will recommend that we do.

665
00:46:19,624 --> 00:46:27,227
[SPEAKER_10]: And then maybe if we do, we can have in-house staff make some of the floor repairs that need to be made.

666
00:46:27,267 --> 00:46:34,490
[SPEAKER_10]: But I do wanna get a couple more opinions or a couple more quotes and then see where we can go from there.

667
00:46:35,158 --> 00:46:38,321
[SPEAKER_05]: Would it be going over the asbestos?

668
00:46:38,401 --> 00:46:49,290
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I think we've talked about the possibility of doing that, but at this point in time, it may just be better off to abate that area.

669
00:46:51,291 --> 00:46:55,354
[SPEAKER_10]: The first quote that came in, it wasn't as much as I thought it was going to be, truthfully.

670
00:46:55,955 --> 00:46:58,937
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll hash it out and we'll discuss it.

671
00:47:00,184 --> 00:47:03,646
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully, if it works out, maybe it'll be a good summer project.

672
00:47:03,666 --> 00:47:08,069
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll have to close the entrance down for a few days and work with it.

673
00:47:08,269 --> 00:47:14,374
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, like I said, I think we can have our in-house staff take over after they complete.

674
00:47:14,994 --> 00:47:17,716
[SPEAKER_14]: The other was the community school entrance.

675
00:47:17,896 --> 00:47:22,039
[SPEAKER_14]: When you're walking in, the blue paint and the rebar was showing in the wall.

676
00:47:22,059 --> 00:47:23,360
[SPEAKER_14]: It's been fixed.

677
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:25,121
[SPEAKER_14]: And scaffolding.

678
00:47:25,141 --> 00:47:26,782
[SPEAKER_10]: It needs to be painted, but it's been fixed.

679
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:27,803
[SPEAKER_10]: But the scaffolding.

680
00:47:29,143 --> 00:47:32,725
[SPEAKER_14]: So scaffolding, can that be done for the light fixtures that are broken in the ceiling?

681
00:47:32,745 --> 00:47:34,326
[SPEAKER_10]: The construction kids are going to do it for us.

682
00:47:35,126 --> 00:47:38,368
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm hoping that they have it set up before the end of school.

683
00:47:38,768 --> 00:47:40,589
[SPEAKER_10]: But either way, we'll have it set up for the summer.

684
00:47:42,890 --> 00:47:46,732
[SPEAKER_10]: Director Riccio's kids are going to set it up for us, and then we'll go up.

685
00:47:47,312 --> 00:47:56,437
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm hoping that maybe we can do some painting, too, in the ceiling, as well as take down the fans and do a couple of other things, yeah.

686
00:47:56,921 --> 00:48:00,403
[SPEAKER_14]: Should I, Carolyn, if you're watching, text me what else I'm forgetting.

687
00:48:00,423 --> 00:48:01,784
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to video that, John.

688
00:48:03,045 --> 00:48:03,625
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, John.

689
00:48:03,665 --> 00:48:11,811
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I know that she did have a request about the baseboard up around the gymnastics area.

690
00:48:11,851 --> 00:48:12,811
[SPEAKER_10]: And I had it tested.

691
00:48:13,392 --> 00:48:15,213
[SPEAKER_10]: So we can remove it ourselves.

692
00:48:15,693 --> 00:48:20,456
[SPEAKER_10]: So we don't have to worry about any problems with it.

693
00:48:21,257 --> 00:48:22,157
[SPEAKER_10]: It's non-asbestos.

694
00:48:22,258 --> 00:48:22,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, great.

695
00:48:22,678 --> 00:48:22,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

696
00:48:23,018 --> 00:48:24,439
[SPEAKER_10]: We can work on that, too.

697
00:48:26,005 --> 00:48:28,207
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it does depend on time.

698
00:48:29,608 --> 00:48:47,539
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, I did request a carpenter, but he has been around for a long time, so he does get time off in the summer, and the summer is a short window, so if he could ever, he's been around for 30 years, he does a great job, and if there's ever a time, maybe we can get him some help, that would be good.

699
00:48:47,559 --> 00:48:48,200
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be great.

700
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:48,460
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

701
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:50,461
[SPEAKER_14]: How many carpenters did you used to have?

702
00:48:54,313 --> 00:48:56,555
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been up to high school for 30 years.

703
00:48:58,196 --> 00:49:01,819
[SPEAKER_10]: There was probably four or five of them, I think, in 1987 when I came on.

704
00:49:03,521 --> 00:49:04,362
[SPEAKER_10]: He does a good job.

705
00:49:05,182 --> 00:49:06,263
[SPEAKER_10]: He does a real good job.

706
00:49:06,403 --> 00:49:09,846
[SPEAKER_10]: Mary Jo, our secretary, she does a fantastic job.

707
00:49:10,146 --> 00:49:11,648
[SPEAKER_10]: We're very lucky.

708
00:49:12,248 --> 00:49:13,549
[SPEAKER_10]: We have some really good people.

709
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:17,801
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

710
00:49:17,861 --> 00:49:24,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Just for clarification, when you're talking about the pool door, you're talking about the door that actually goes up, the entrance to the pool upstairs?

711
00:49:24,129 --> 00:49:25,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the pool entrance.

712
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:26,471
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, from the outside.

713
00:49:26,552 --> 00:49:27,152
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, door 31.

714
00:49:28,198 --> 00:49:31,459
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the outside door that you go along the ramp and go in.

715
00:49:31,479 --> 00:49:32,359
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay.

716
00:49:32,399 --> 00:49:32,999
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the door.

717
00:49:33,059 --> 00:49:33,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

718
00:49:33,279 --> 00:49:34,619
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's the door I want.

719
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:34,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

720
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:35,360
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

721
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:40,281
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, and when you were talking about the floor, were you talking about that carpet that was there for a while?

722
00:49:40,301 --> 00:49:43,742
[SPEAKER_10]: We took it out because it was starting to get a little bit beat up.

723
00:49:43,882 --> 00:49:53,924
[SPEAKER_10]: So, um, now we're just talking about removing the tile and then we'll put brand new tile down and it's put some pitches hung up inside there and some paint.

724
00:49:54,583 --> 00:49:57,245
[SPEAKER_10]: So that would be the nice finishing touch at this point.

725
00:49:57,405 --> 00:49:57,645
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

726
00:49:57,745 --> 00:50:16,139
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other thing I want to ask is, when you were doing this report, have you had a list, or maybe I want to call it a wish list, but over the years we've all had the opportunity as a committee and singly to go to all the schools and see what needs to be done, what maintenance needs to be done, what needs to be upgraded.

727
00:50:16,599 --> 00:50:22,584
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was just curious in knowing, when you wrote the report, did you have the wish list from the schools?

728
00:50:24,045 --> 00:50:34,294
[SPEAKER_10]: From the other schools, I haven't really talked enough to the principals to really find out if they have anything in the wish list.

729
00:50:34,334 --> 00:50:40,439
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, I know that we did have a discussion on the bleachers in the various schools.

730
00:50:40,499 --> 00:50:47,205
[SPEAKER_10]: And we did have Frank go out, and I did submit a report that we're in pretty good shape in most of the schools.

731
00:50:47,642 --> 00:50:58,227
[SPEAKER_10]: but over the summer, again, it might be a good time to maybe have a company come out and replace some of the nuts and bolts that are making the bleachers come in and out and work and things like that.

732
00:50:58,627 --> 00:51:09,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, over the years, it's basically been two just to make sure like, you know, the bathrooms are back up to date because there were a lot of things that were missing when we had walked through the playgrounds.

733
00:51:10,293 --> 00:51:12,434
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that's something that we've all looked at.

734
00:51:12,874 --> 00:51:13,395
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we did.

735
00:51:13,415 --> 00:51:16,096
[SPEAKER_10]: And now we've been, that would be probably, you know, a capital,

736
00:51:17,034 --> 00:51:28,262
[SPEAKER_10]: capital wish list or improvement, even some of the paving that needs to be done in some of the parking lots and things like that, it probably would fall more under the capital in the area.

737
00:51:28,602 --> 00:51:38,089
[SPEAKER_03]: And just the regular maintenance that we've needed in general, like keeping up with the paint, keeping up with the ceilings, keeping up with, you know, all of it.

738
00:51:38,909 --> 00:51:40,951
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we are, you know, we're working towards it.

739
00:51:41,011 --> 00:51:45,414
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I said, I've been very lucky to be able to use the Department of Corrections

740
00:51:46,056 --> 00:51:47,936
[SPEAKER_10]: And they've helped us out at the Curtis Tufts.

741
00:51:48,417 --> 00:51:50,157
[SPEAKER_10]: They were at the Brooks earlier this year.

742
00:51:50,577 --> 00:51:55,878
[SPEAKER_10]: I have some plans, hopefully this summer, to bring them down to the Roberts because they had some requests.

743
00:51:55,998 --> 00:52:02,400
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we'll move them, you know, if we can get them, the longer we can get them, obviously the better.

744
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:07,841
[SPEAKER_10]: So we can keep moving around in the buildings, doing common areas, doing classrooms, doing anything.

745
00:52:08,632 --> 00:52:10,133
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's the same thing with the flooring.

746
00:52:10,153 --> 00:52:14,974
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of the flooring needs to be looked at again in the different classrooms.

747
00:52:14,994 --> 00:52:16,614
[SPEAKER_10]: There may be some tiles popping up.

748
00:52:17,035 --> 00:52:26,717
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's just part of our everyday kind of routine that we make our way around town and try to keep it honest, I guess you could say.

749
00:52:26,737 --> 00:52:27,578
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

750
00:52:27,618 --> 00:52:30,659
[SPEAKER_03]: And what about the contractors that we have at the high school for the cleaning?

751
00:52:31,039 --> 00:52:32,299
[SPEAKER_10]: Prospect contractors.

752
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:33,479
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, they've been doing a good job.

753
00:52:33,499 --> 00:52:34,220
[SPEAKER_10]: They've been very good.

754
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,580
[SPEAKER_03]: They're the ones that we still have?

755
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:35,680
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

756
00:52:36,033 --> 00:52:37,574
[SPEAKER_10]: they were the ones that we hired this year.

757
00:52:37,614 --> 00:52:38,155
[SPEAKER_10]: They were new.

758
00:52:38,255 --> 00:52:40,376
[SPEAKER_10]: We had a empire before.

759
00:52:40,396 --> 00:52:53,086
[SPEAKER_10]: Now prospect was awarded the, um, the bid after we did an extensive interview process, the superintendent, um, there was a few of us there and, um, they've been doing a pretty good job there.

760
00:52:53,386 --> 00:52:55,348
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, they're resourceful.

761
00:52:55,468 --> 00:53:01,052
[SPEAKER_10]: They, they answer the phone, they take care of our needs, you know, when we need them for extra, uh,

762
00:53:02,635 --> 00:53:06,637
[SPEAKER_10]: issues and you know that sometimes you have your regular everyday issue.

763
00:53:07,057 --> 00:53:09,799
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe something was missed or something, something else.

764
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:11,980
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're really good about responding to everything.

765
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,921
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't had a problem with them at all.

766
00:53:13,961 --> 00:53:17,243
[SPEAKER_10]: I couldn't, couldn't say that, you know, they haven't been good.

767
00:53:18,604 --> 00:53:20,204
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Benedetto.

768
00:53:20,224 --> 00:53:21,105
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

769
00:53:21,868 --> 00:53:28,310
[SPEAKER_06]: John, first of all, I want to shout out to you and to Alicia Hunt on the new lighting at the Curtis Tough School.

770
00:53:28,430 --> 00:53:29,830
[SPEAKER_10]: Alicia does a fabulous job.

771
00:53:29,990 --> 00:53:38,452
[SPEAKER_06]: That was requested a few years ago and that took a lot of work to get the grant and get the money and all the work that's been done at that school.

772
00:53:38,792 --> 00:53:41,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't forget to bring the prisoners back and finish the paint job there.

773
00:53:42,213 --> 00:53:44,114
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we'll get them back in there again and I think we're

774
00:53:45,488 --> 00:53:49,550
[SPEAKER_10]: we're going to try to knock off a couple of more of the floors down there this summer.

775
00:53:49,570 --> 00:53:55,712
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, we did make a, uh, we did make a change, a personnel change down at that building.

776
00:53:55,812 --> 00:54:00,234
[SPEAKER_10]: So, um, I think he, he's done a very good job.

777
00:54:00,934 --> 00:54:06,256
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that they were talking about relocating some office space and do you have any updates on that?

778
00:54:06,296 --> 00:54:10,418
[SPEAKER_06]: Like where the kitchen is and the cabinets of, yeah, well it's like,

779
00:54:11,464 --> 00:54:13,245
[SPEAKER_10]: We're gonna have to get back down there again.

780
00:54:13,465 --> 00:54:13,946
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?

781
00:54:13,966 --> 00:54:15,186
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe we'll talk about it.

782
00:54:15,306 --> 00:54:16,787
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it's it's funny.

783
00:54:16,927 --> 00:54:20,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it could be a program like the kitchen area.

784
00:54:22,090 --> 00:54:23,391
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I said, we'll see what we can do.

785
00:54:23,891 --> 00:54:25,171
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, you get me that carpenter?

786
00:54:25,392 --> 00:54:27,373
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's my point.

787
00:54:28,273 --> 00:54:33,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Not only do we need the carpenter, we could also use a vocational if they plan it as a project.

788
00:54:33,856 --> 00:54:39,259
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe we could start now talking to the director of... Yeah, absolutely.

789
00:54:39,698 --> 00:54:51,164
[SPEAKER_06]: And maybe have that be a work project that throughout the city and have our own children learning right there and interacting with the other students that go to that school at the same time.

790
00:54:51,244 --> 00:54:54,566
[SPEAKER_10]: I really, whatever we could do, that'd be, that'd be fantastic.

791
00:54:54,626 --> 00:54:59,289
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, um, so building has come a long way in the last year or so.

792
00:54:59,649 --> 00:55:02,010
[SPEAKER_10]: And, um, well, you know, we'll keep plugging away.

793
00:55:02,251 --> 00:55:06,913
[SPEAKER_06]: So I, I support a hundred percent your request for an additional carpenter.

794
00:55:07,173 --> 00:55:08,394
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of buildings.

795
00:55:09,677 --> 00:55:13,039
[SPEAKER_06]: and a lot of maintenance and our buildings are aging every year.

796
00:55:13,579 --> 00:55:27,790
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and as the superintendent has committed funds to maintaining and upkeeping and grading, I as committee member are gonna support your requests that you have asked for in this budget request.

797
00:55:27,810 --> 00:55:34,395
[SPEAKER_06]: I also wanted to ask you, you listed that at the Andrews Middle School, you're in need of a floor scupper.

798
00:55:34,616 --> 00:55:35,676
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you know how much that is?

799
00:55:38,677 --> 00:55:41,979
[SPEAKER_10]: 6,000 or so in that vicinity, maybe even a little less.

800
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:46,723
[SPEAKER_10]: We purchased one this past year for the Roberts, so.

801
00:55:47,583 --> 00:55:48,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Good to know.

802
00:55:49,324 --> 00:55:52,887
[SPEAKER_06]: Just because I had no idea, like, a cost value of that.

803
00:55:53,347 --> 00:56:01,753
[SPEAKER_06]: So you need a carpenter and $6,000 in addition to the $200,000 that the superintendent is going to add to the light items.

804
00:56:02,173 --> 00:56:05,115
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure, we'll take whatever we need.

805
00:56:05,915 --> 00:56:08,197
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever it is, you'll get a chance to vote on it.

806
00:56:08,709 --> 00:56:08,849
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

807
00:56:08,869 --> 00:56:09,149
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

808
00:56:09,769 --> 00:56:09,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

809
00:56:09,969 --> 00:56:10,270
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.

810
00:56:10,650 --> 00:56:13,511
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, John, for all your work.

811
00:56:14,091 --> 00:56:20,813
[SPEAKER_09]: John, John, is there any chance of, uh, getting the auto body shop on your list of places to be painted?

812
00:56:21,454 --> 00:56:34,819
[SPEAKER_09]: The, the ceiling is really, really tough and I guess they want to replace the floor, but they don't want to do anything with the floor until the ceiling gets done because they want the place to be a showcase, but it hasn't been painted.

813
00:56:35,099 --> 00:56:36,059
[SPEAKER_09]: The walls have been painted.

814
00:56:36,099 --> 00:56:36,759
[SPEAKER_09]: They look great.

815
00:56:36,959 --> 00:56:38,380
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of work has been done there, but,

816
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:42,422
[SPEAKER_09]: The ceiling in the auto body shop is just, it's time.

817
00:56:42,823 --> 00:56:44,003
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I can look into it.

818
00:56:44,043 --> 00:56:51,508
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I said, it would probably be, you know, that would probably have to be sprayed.

819
00:56:51,528 --> 00:56:51,608
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

820
00:56:51,648 --> 00:56:52,789
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?

821
00:56:52,889 --> 00:57:04,536
[SPEAKER_10]: So I can certainly get a price and find out, you know, I know that the DOC wouldn't be something that they would do, you know, spraying and stuff.

822
00:57:04,676 --> 00:57:06,838
[SPEAKER_09]: You just take a look at it when you get a chance.

823
00:57:07,555 --> 00:57:10,296
[SPEAKER_09]: see if we can put our heads together and come up with a solution.

824
00:57:10,476 --> 00:57:15,477
[SPEAKER_10]: We use a guy to paint around the school sometimes and he's pretty reasonable.

825
00:57:15,517 --> 00:57:17,497
[SPEAKER_10]: He's done some work in the vocational school.

826
00:57:18,097 --> 00:57:22,378
[SPEAKER_10]: So I can, I can, um, I can call him up and see if you get a price.

827
00:57:22,978 --> 00:57:23,219
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

828
00:57:23,319 --> 00:57:24,139
[SPEAKER_09]: The very least.

829
00:57:24,179 --> 00:57:24,379
[SPEAKER_09]: Good.

830
00:57:24,639 --> 00:57:24,819
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

831
00:57:25,239 --> 00:57:25,879
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

832
00:57:26,679 --> 00:57:26,839
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

833
00:57:26,859 --> 00:57:27,359
[SPEAKER_15]: Van de Kloot.

834
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:30,780
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, I think mayor Burke, this is actually a question for you.

835
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,981
[SPEAKER_15]: Earlier this year we started out by putting together,

836
00:57:34,626 --> 00:57:49,139
[SPEAKER_15]: items that we thought were part of a capital improvement plan, including the edging along at the middle school complex, all of that edging along the roads that were sidewalk, which were a concern.

837
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:52,002
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think also the playgrounds.

838
00:57:52,522 --> 00:57:59,068
[SPEAKER_15]: But I haven't, we're really sort of talking about individual projects again and not the capital improvement plan.

839
00:57:59,269 --> 00:58:00,490
[SPEAKER_15]: Where are we on that?

840
00:58:01,038 --> 00:58:04,320
[SPEAKER_05]: We have pretty much nailed down the city side of things.

841
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:09,143
[SPEAKER_05]: We're waiting to have another committee of the whole to finalize the school side of everything.

842
00:58:09,763 --> 00:58:18,788
[SPEAKER_05]: But as far as freedom way goes, I'm having the engineering department looking at seeing if we can create it as a public way because then it's applicable for check to 90 funding.

843
00:58:19,629 --> 00:58:25,112
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have a Cassandra could lead us working on that as we speak because if we can get that, then we could get that whole.

844
00:58:25,693 --> 00:58:26,433
[SPEAKER_05]: road done.

845
00:58:27,174 --> 00:58:28,814
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm keeping my fingers crossed.

846
00:58:29,294 --> 00:58:36,697
[SPEAKER_15]: And would a project like, I mean, again, we've, we've sort of had ongoing concerns ultimately about the play surfaces and the playgrounds.

847
00:58:36,877 --> 00:58:46,420
[SPEAKER_15]: And I know that much work was done and there were patches and whatever, but you know, it's still out there as a project, which we, we need to take a look at.

848
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:49,642
[SPEAKER_05]: So finishing up fine tuning pretty soon.

849
00:58:50,402 --> 00:58:51,002
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

850
00:58:51,262 --> 00:58:51,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

851
00:58:52,042 --> 00:58:52,383
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

852
00:58:53,063 --> 00:58:53,363
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

853
00:58:54,942 --> 00:58:55,622
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a citizen.

854
00:58:58,724 --> 00:59:00,165
[SPEAKER_05]: Name and address for the record, please.

855
00:59:00,745 --> 00:59:02,586
[SPEAKER_08]: David McKillop, 94 Rockland Road.

856
00:59:02,986 --> 00:59:03,766
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening everyone.

857
00:59:04,627 --> 00:59:13,071
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I was actually at the, um, city council meeting about the capital improvement in the SOI and we were kind of, there were some things being bantered back and forth.

858
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:19,594
[SPEAKER_08]: My question is, uh, in the capital improvement program, is there an opportunity to usurp some of that money?

859
00:59:20,228 --> 00:59:23,072
[SPEAKER_08]: for maintenance for an extended amount of time.

860
00:59:35,906 --> 00:59:40,227
[SPEAKER_08]: create some sort of a bucket of money, if you will, for this.

861
00:59:40,247 --> 00:59:44,149
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the superintendent's fine-tuning the plan for the school side.

862
00:59:44,229 --> 00:59:47,910
[SPEAKER_05]: And once we get that, then we'll develop the dollars that are needed.

863
00:59:47,950 --> 00:59:51,471
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we'll try to put together the puzzle of money to pay for it.

864
00:59:51,791 --> 01:00:00,414
[SPEAKER_08]: One suggestion or one idea might be where you had done a tremendous job collecting taxes on property that did not have taxes collected on.

865
01:00:00,454 --> 01:00:02,154
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it was over $2.8, $2.9 million this year.

866
01:00:05,075 --> 01:00:14,763
[SPEAKER_08]: That may not happen every single year, but is there a possibility where we could actually take some of that instead of putting it into the general fund and applying that to the maintenance of the schools?

867
01:00:14,803 --> 01:00:17,485
[SPEAKER_08]: Because to be honest with you, I feel bad for John.

868
01:00:17,625 --> 01:00:18,826
[SPEAKER_08]: I think he needs two carpenters.

869
01:00:19,747 --> 01:00:24,631
[SPEAKER_08]: I have an 11,000 square foot building and I could never do what he does with one person.

870
01:00:25,211 --> 01:00:32,437
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just a suggestion, but there has to be something to take these schools to a different level because I remember I was here

871
01:00:32,941 --> 01:00:40,448
[SPEAKER_08]: when we built the middle schools and we were kind of fighting, you know, we're taking them out of the neighborhoods and putting them into a general area.

872
01:00:41,009 --> 01:00:42,790
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't about the schools that I was fighting.

873
01:00:42,830 --> 01:00:43,751
[SPEAKER_08]: It was about the maintenance.

874
01:00:43,931 --> 01:00:46,854
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause we were complaining that the older schools were not habitable.

875
01:00:46,994 --> 01:00:49,797
[SPEAKER_08]: They make great condos now, but they're not habitable for schools.

876
01:00:50,417 --> 01:00:54,061
[SPEAKER_08]: So here we are now 15, 20 years, however many years it was.

877
01:00:54,121 --> 01:00:58,445
[SPEAKER_08]: And I made the same point, you know, now some of these schools need some dramatic maintenance.

878
01:00:59,002 --> 01:01:06,586
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can get $10 million in capital improvement, but if you don't have a maintenance plan, you're going to be back in the same boat 10 and 15 years from now.

879
01:01:07,106 --> 01:01:08,927
[SPEAKER_08]: So you need to create a plan for this.

880
01:01:09,507 --> 01:01:20,392
[SPEAKER_08]: And that has to be something that has to be discussed and scrutinized and scrutinized, because that money is money that's not going to be wasted, but is certainly going to be spent unwisely 5, 10, 15 years from now.

881
01:01:20,952 --> 01:01:21,292
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

882
01:01:21,412 --> 01:01:21,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

883
01:01:24,552 --> 01:01:27,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a motion to accept the pre-budget report as reported?

884
01:01:27,713 --> 01:01:31,513
[SPEAKER_05]: So moved by Mr. Benner, seconded by Mr. Skerry.

885
01:01:31,573 --> 01:01:32,293
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

886
01:01:32,313 --> 01:01:32,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

887
01:01:33,214 --> 01:01:33,974
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

888
01:01:34,334 --> 01:01:35,134
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

889
01:01:35,554 --> 01:01:35,914
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

890
01:01:36,654 --> 01:01:40,555
[SPEAKER_05]: Report on state proposed budget for the fiscal year 18, Mr. Superintendent.

891
01:01:40,935 --> 01:01:47,396
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a good opportunity for me to wrap a few things together and also talk about some of the things that just came up.

892
01:01:48,637 --> 01:01:50,657
[SPEAKER_00]: The Massachusetts House of Representatives

893
01:01:51,390 --> 01:01:58,052
[SPEAKER_00]: passed its initial version of the FY 2018 state budget last Tuesday, April 25th.

894
01:01:59,952 --> 01:02:06,294
[SPEAKER_00]: The House version will now go to the State Senate for their deliberations, ways and means, and then the floor.

895
01:02:07,334 --> 01:02:11,255
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would expect the Senate version to emerge sometime in late May.

896
01:02:12,635 --> 01:02:19,857
[SPEAKER_00]: Since there will be differences between the two legislative bodies, there will be a joint conference committee consisting of three members from each chamber.

897
01:02:21,033 --> 01:02:27,919
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll try to reconcile their differences and then go to the full body in each chamber to get an up or down vote.

898
01:02:27,959 --> 01:02:30,361
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't make changes once it comes out of conference committee.

899
01:02:32,363 --> 01:02:36,727
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the changes, once it comes out from the full legislature, will go to the governor.

900
01:02:36,747 --> 01:02:38,949
[SPEAKER_00]: The governor undoubtedly will veto some line items.

901
01:02:39,530 --> 01:02:44,254
[SPEAKER_00]: The legislature historically will override most of his vetoes, give or take a few here and there.

902
01:02:46,585 --> 01:02:51,929
[SPEAKER_00]: and the state budget should be completed sometime by the end of June.

903
01:02:51,989 --> 01:03:04,179
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we have to start doing our budgets well in advance of that, so we start to look at what the House and the Senate will do, because typically there are pretty good guidelines as to what will happen.

904
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:06,922
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't know.

905
01:03:07,282 --> 01:03:13,267
[SPEAKER_00]: The Senate tends to be a little bit more financially generous than the House, although items vary from area to area.

906
01:03:14,313 --> 01:03:20,457
[SPEAKER_00]: For the first time, the initial budget from the House exceeds $40 billion.

907
01:03:21,417 --> 01:03:32,204
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually less than what the governor proposed, slightly, but it still exceeds $40 billion to support the various line items and any new programs and services.

908
01:03:32,664 --> 01:03:41,750
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of the new money goes to mass health, pensions, and a modest increase in local aid.

909
01:03:42,350 --> 01:03:42,730
[SPEAKER_05]: Limited.

910
01:03:43,171 --> 01:03:43,711
[SPEAKER_00]: Very limited.

911
01:03:44,307 --> 01:03:44,607
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

912
01:03:44,707 --> 01:03:52,051
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go into some of that in a way, but 40% of the budget typically or more right now is mass health.

913
01:03:53,351 --> 01:04:01,976
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gives you an idea of, you know, it may be $40 billion, but so much of it is eaten up by certain entitlements that, uh, there isn't a lot of discretionary funding.

914
01:04:02,856 --> 01:04:10,580
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main limitation on the budget is the availability of money, uh, to support the various line items.

915
01:04:11,239 --> 01:04:14,080
[SPEAKER_00]: any new programs and services, just like we're talking about right now.

916
01:04:14,121 --> 01:04:18,663
[SPEAKER_00]: How much money is going to be available to do all the things that you think should be done?

917
01:04:19,523 --> 01:04:22,965
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the new money, as I say, goes for certain items.

918
01:04:23,986 --> 01:04:28,888
[SPEAKER_00]: During FY 2016, the state found the budget was initially short $455 million.

919
01:04:28,908 --> 01:04:32,970
[SPEAKER_00]: And this year, revenue, as the end of March, is running $220 million below estimates.

920
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:41,120
[SPEAKER_00]: April receipt should be higher.

921
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:42,761
[SPEAKER_00]: April is usually a very good month.

922
01:04:42,781 --> 01:04:44,081
[SPEAKER_00]: The beginning of the month was good.

923
01:04:44,541 --> 01:04:48,042
[SPEAKER_00]: But until we get the final figures, we don't know.

924
01:04:48,142 --> 01:04:51,602
[SPEAKER_00]: But typically, we should be able to close a good portion of that gap.

925
01:04:52,363 --> 01:04:55,403
[SPEAKER_00]: But closing that gap doesn't give us any surplus, doesn't give any excess.

926
01:04:55,463 --> 01:04:57,444
[SPEAKER_00]: It just gives us a gap close.

927
01:04:58,504 --> 01:05:03,845
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no guarantee that how much money will come in, actually, in June, in May and June.

928
01:05:05,165 --> 01:05:07,846
[SPEAKER_00]: Originally, the projection for this year was a 3.1%

929
01:05:09,570 --> 01:05:11,411
[SPEAKER_00]: growth factor at the state level.

930
01:05:12,051 --> 01:05:13,591
[SPEAKER_00]: And through March, it's 1.7%.

931
01:05:14,392 --> 01:05:15,052
[SPEAKER_00]: Gives you an idea.

932
01:05:16,152 --> 01:05:17,193
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's nationally, too.

933
01:05:17,213 --> 01:05:20,614
[SPEAKER_00]: 2% growth is sort of like, you know, a hallmark.

934
01:05:21,754 --> 01:05:30,377
[SPEAKER_00]: A study by the Federal Reserve explained that while Massachusetts unemployment was down, there was a significant drop in wages and hours worked.

935
01:05:31,457 --> 01:05:34,598
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means that the overall personal income was lower.

936
01:05:36,439 --> 01:05:39,420
[SPEAKER_00]: Spending was higher, most notably in the health sector.

937
01:05:40,252 --> 01:05:46,576
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, a sales tax on merchandise was affected by increased online buying, for which there is no tax.

938
01:05:47,476 --> 01:05:53,159
[SPEAKER_00]: Furthermore, it's impossible that the income tax rate will drop again because of the automatic trigger built into the state.

939
01:05:54,980 --> 01:06:01,884
[SPEAKER_00]: The drop in the income tax cost the Commonwealth more of a billion dollars a year since that trigger was put in place.

940
01:06:04,866 --> 01:06:08,928
[SPEAKER_00]: There appears to be no appetite for increased taxation

941
01:06:09,915 --> 01:06:16,459
[SPEAKER_00]: Although there may be some proposal out of the Senate, as Senate President Rosenberg seems to put this forward a little bit.

942
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:20,141
[SPEAKER_00]: Although tax proposals have to emanate from the House first.

943
01:06:21,261 --> 01:06:27,745
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, we can expect some cutbacks from Washington on domestic spending, including various education items.

944
01:06:29,152 --> 01:06:32,433
[SPEAKER_00]: So the following items are things to think about in the house budget.

945
01:06:32,973 --> 01:06:40,155
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, they haven't printed the whole house budget, so I can't get every nickel and dime figured out a hundred percent, but I've gone behind the numbers as much as I can.

946
01:06:40,895 --> 01:06:44,976
[SPEAKER_00]: Chapter 70 is $30 per pupil in the house budget.

947
01:06:45,516 --> 01:06:47,557
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year it was $55 per pupil.

948
01:06:49,037 --> 01:06:50,438
[SPEAKER_00]: The governor's proposing $20 per pupil.

949
01:06:52,608 --> 01:06:54,850
[SPEAKER_00]: That's approximately $145,000.

950
01:06:55,751 --> 01:07:01,576
[SPEAKER_00]: Unrestricted municipal aid is up statewide by 40 million, but when it's distributed, it isn't that much.

951
01:07:02,757 --> 01:07:06,200
[SPEAKER_00]: The special education circuit breaker was level funded in the house budget.

952
01:07:07,180 --> 01:07:11,404
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be short somewhere between 10 and $15 million for full funding.

953
01:07:12,325 --> 01:07:17,009
[SPEAKER_00]: And as more students qualify, there's a greater demand on this account.

954
01:07:18,708 --> 01:07:20,669
[SPEAKER_00]: We're projecting less funding in fiscal 2017.

955
01:07:20,729 --> 01:07:22,951
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in there in 2016.

956
01:07:23,771 --> 01:07:26,353
[SPEAKER_00]: We've already given you some of those numbers in the last financial report.

957
01:07:27,434 --> 01:07:29,195
[SPEAKER_00]: And there could be a further reduction in fiscal 2018.

958
01:07:29,676 --> 01:07:32,598
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's for extraordinary special ed costs.

959
01:07:32,638 --> 01:07:34,159
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to pay attention to that.

960
01:07:34,979 --> 01:07:36,740
[SPEAKER_00]: Charter school funding is level funded.

961
01:07:37,601 --> 01:07:43,305
[SPEAKER_00]: We expect the statewide entitlement to be $60 million below need, maybe more, depending on how much expansion.

962
01:07:44,005 --> 01:07:47,688
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the number of students who opt for charter schools, we could see an increase

963
01:07:48,353 --> 01:07:53,715
[SPEAKER_00]: in our local cost, although I think we've leveled pretty well and we're bringing people back.

964
01:07:55,716 --> 01:08:06,160
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also know that Washington is very heavy on pro-choice with Secretary DeVos, and we'll see what comes out of there for the choice issues in support of charter schools.

965
01:08:07,060 --> 01:08:13,623
[SPEAKER_00]: Homeless transportation is level funded, 50% of what we think entitlement would be, if that.

966
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:17,061
[SPEAKER_00]: No funding, new funding came back for kindergarten.

967
01:08:17,081 --> 01:08:22,323
[SPEAKER_00]: We lost $143,000 last year, and there's nothing in that line item this year.

968
01:08:23,524 --> 01:08:26,445
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of district, non-resident transportation is cut.

969
01:08:27,646 --> 01:08:30,467
[SPEAKER_00]: Could lose about $30,000 in that particular line item.

970
01:08:31,527 --> 01:08:35,469
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no new funding for technology that we've seen outside of what I presented this evening.

971
01:08:36,710 --> 01:08:39,631
[SPEAKER_00]: We will be able to get some significant federal dollars, as I explained.

972
01:08:40,771 --> 01:08:43,852
[SPEAKER_00]: The Department of Public Health funding should be reasonably stable.

973
01:08:43,872 --> 01:08:48,154
[SPEAKER_00]: That funds a nurse and some of the work that's done on health prevention.

974
01:08:48,874 --> 01:08:59,198
[SPEAKER_00]: Early childhood funding through the grant account is expected to lose 30% of current level as priorities shift from programs to workforce development support.

975
01:08:59,599 --> 01:09:08,282
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, increasing the salaries of people in the nonprofit sector and providing additional training for them because they're well underfunded.

976
01:09:08,722 --> 01:09:10,283
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's certainly a worthy priority

977
01:09:10,828 --> 01:09:12,468
[SPEAKER_00]: But they didn't say we'll do both.

978
01:09:12,508 --> 01:09:15,769
[SPEAKER_00]: They said we'll take the money from the programs and move it over there.

979
01:09:16,310 --> 01:09:19,430
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a little bit more there, but it's not clear.

980
01:09:20,011 --> 01:09:25,072
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just got through talking a little bit about maintenance and things of that type.

981
01:09:25,912 --> 01:09:27,833
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a finite pot of gold out there.

982
01:09:28,673 --> 01:09:31,374
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just can't say we'll just do everything.

983
01:09:32,174 --> 01:09:35,935
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll try to provide you with options across the board so you can select.

984
01:09:36,615 --> 01:09:39,416
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully, we'll continue to search out new sources of funding

985
01:09:40,113 --> 01:09:45,435
[SPEAKER_00]: like we have with the vocational school and other things and opiate prevention to augment what we have.

986
01:09:45,975 --> 01:09:52,137
[SPEAKER_00]: But the general distributions coming from the state place a tremendous burden on the locality.

987
01:09:52,717 --> 01:09:54,998
[SPEAKER_00]: The cost of health care keeps going up.

988
01:09:55,478 --> 01:09:57,378
[SPEAKER_00]: We just don't know, you know, where it's coming.

989
01:09:57,398 --> 01:10:01,940
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what Washington's going to do and what's going to happen to that situation yet.

990
01:10:02,380 --> 01:10:03,380
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes back and forth.

991
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:06,681
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are a lot of other factors that have to come into play.

992
01:10:07,441 --> 01:10:08,982
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also have

993
01:10:09,590 --> 01:10:18,016
[SPEAKER_00]: to carry at least a 2.5% increase in salary negotiations, which isn't outrageous, but it's money.

994
01:10:19,717 --> 01:10:26,602
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you also have step increases that people who are starting, the young teachers move up the steps, that's on top of the 2.5.

995
01:10:26,642 --> 01:10:28,904
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of factors.

996
01:10:29,564 --> 01:10:35,428
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be easy for me to get up and say, sure, tell me whatever you want me to fix, tell me whatever you want me to do, go add this, add that.

997
01:10:35,969 --> 01:10:37,310
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that simple and you know it.

998
01:10:37,907 --> 01:10:43,992
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what it is is that we have to lay it all out and decide what's most important to us and move forward with that.

999
01:10:44,373 --> 01:10:48,536
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a lot of great things going on in this community and go a lot of great things going on in the school system.

1000
01:10:48,977 --> 01:10:50,398
[SPEAKER_00]: Should be very proud of the work you've done.

1001
01:10:50,818 --> 01:10:53,661
[SPEAKER_00]: Very proud of the administration and city hall supporting us.

1002
01:10:54,061 --> 01:10:59,746
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you know, there will be some limitations and we'll have to make some tough choices, forced choices.

1003
01:10:59,766 --> 01:11:02,709
[SPEAKER_00]: So the budget process is beginning at the state house.

1004
01:11:03,621 --> 01:11:04,742
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll keep watching the Senate.

1005
01:11:04,922 --> 01:11:07,163
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go up and lobby, you know, for other things.

1006
01:11:07,644 --> 01:11:08,985
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk to people about things.

1007
01:11:09,025 --> 01:11:11,526
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll look for additional grants, look for additional revenue.

1008
01:11:12,007 --> 01:11:19,872
[SPEAKER_00]: We've recaptured some revenue through the minute man activity, the revenue coming in through the vocational school, but still it's going to be spread out.

1009
01:11:20,112 --> 01:11:23,995
[SPEAKER_00]: So just wanted to give you a quick snapshot of the state budget so far.

1010
01:11:24,295 --> 01:11:28,458
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll keep you posted and we'll keep talking budget as we go forward and try to set priorities.

1011
01:11:29,459 --> 01:11:29,619
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

1012
01:11:29,639 --> 01:11:29,819
[SPEAKER_14]: Stone.

1013
01:11:31,007 --> 01:11:35,908
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Bellson, can you just explain the out-of-district non-resident transportation could lose about $30,000.

1014
01:11:36,368 --> 01:11:38,088
[SPEAKER_14]: So who does that transport?

1015
01:11:38,189 --> 01:11:39,509
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, that's the Minuteman bus.

1016
01:11:39,909 --> 01:11:40,229
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

1017
01:11:40,609 --> 01:11:45,670
[SPEAKER_00]: So in another year from now, we won't have a bus going to Minuteman.

1018
01:11:46,130 --> 01:11:49,331
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to try and get a smaller vehicle, which may cost less.

1019
01:11:50,011 --> 01:11:55,212
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I lose the reimbursement for non-resident last year, two years ago, it was almost $3 million.

1020
01:11:55,612 --> 01:11:56,832
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it went down to half of that.

1021
01:11:57,232 --> 01:11:59,173
[SPEAKER_00]: And this year in the House budget, it's $250,000 for that line item.

1022
01:12:00,648 --> 01:12:03,289
[SPEAKER_14]: So how many students are at Minuteman right now?

1023
01:12:03,329 --> 01:12:05,010
[SPEAKER_00]: This year, there's about 16 students.

1024
01:12:05,450 --> 01:12:06,630
[SPEAKER_00]: Next year, I would expect eight.

1025
01:12:06,890 --> 01:12:07,991
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, they could fit in my van.

1026
01:12:08,171 --> 01:12:08,971
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll take them in my van.

1027
01:12:09,011 --> 01:12:09,651
[SPEAKER_00]: You could do it.

1028
01:12:09,932 --> 01:12:10,632
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll get you licensed.

1029
01:12:11,112 --> 01:12:14,894
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, hey, listen, if you can't go one way, we'll must own the other way.

1030
01:12:15,574 --> 01:12:15,834
OK?

1031
01:12:15,894 --> 01:12:16,214
[SPEAKER_00]: How's that?

1032
01:12:16,734 --> 01:12:17,094
[SPEAKER_00]: OK?

1033
01:12:17,955 --> 01:12:18,375
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good.

1034
01:12:18,415 --> 01:12:18,835
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1035
01:12:19,195 --> 01:12:19,495
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.

1036
01:12:19,675 --> 01:12:19,915
[SPEAKER_00]: What else?

1037
01:12:19,935 --> 01:12:20,035
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

1038
01:12:20,055 --> 01:12:20,596
[SPEAKER_15]: Van de Kloot.

1039
01:12:20,956 --> 01:12:21,496
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1040
01:12:21,596 --> 01:12:23,697
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. Superintendent, for your report.

1041
01:12:24,077 --> 01:12:29,480
[SPEAKER_15]: You touched on possible federal impacts, and of course that picture is not clear to us at this time.

1042
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:47,910
[SPEAKER_15]: However, today the National School Boards Association did send out an alert because of the concern about the legislation to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act and the impact on Medicaid funding for public school students.

1043
01:12:48,971 --> 01:12:51,672
[SPEAKER_15]: If passed at this point, it would

1044
01:12:53,093 --> 01:13:02,795
[SPEAKER_15]: limit Medicaid funding and it says the impact the ability of students with disabilities and students in poverty to receive critical necessary health services in public schools.

1045
01:13:03,355 --> 01:13:13,057
[SPEAKER_15]: The legislation will require schools to compete for limited Medicaid funding and result in the institution of arbitrary caps and how much Medicaid reimbursements are made to public schools.

1046
01:13:13,437 --> 01:13:20,358
[SPEAKER_15]: Again this would be another area where I know that money comes back to the city but it's another place where we would

1047
01:13:22,005 --> 01:13:22,645
[SPEAKER_15]: find a loss.

1048
01:13:22,825 --> 01:13:24,025
[SPEAKER_05]: It impacts the pie.

1049
01:13:24,045 --> 01:13:26,526
[SPEAKER_15]: It impacts the pie.

1050
01:13:26,626 --> 01:13:31,367
[SPEAKER_15]: They urge us to call our House of Representatives people.

1051
01:13:31,387 --> 01:13:36,328
[SPEAKER_15]: Of course, we understand where they already sit in our state.

1052
01:13:37,208 --> 01:13:38,908
[SPEAKER_15]: However, I did want to bring it to your attention.

1053
01:13:39,008 --> 01:13:40,528
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's definitely an issue.

1054
01:13:40,828 --> 01:13:46,609
[SPEAKER_00]: Just so you know, the Medicaid funding is generated by students who are eligible through disabilities and the like.

1055
01:13:46,969 --> 01:13:47,930
[SPEAKER_00]: The money comes back.

1056
01:13:48,170 --> 01:13:49,170
[SPEAKER_00]: Short Collaborative is our

1057
01:13:50,869 --> 01:13:54,230
[SPEAKER_00]: broker, if you will, it comes back through it, but it goes into the city treasury.

1058
01:13:54,270 --> 01:14:00,693
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the mayor points out, it adds to the total pie that's then available for redistribution to the schools, to the city and other things.

1059
01:14:00,713 --> 01:14:03,634
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's factored into the overall who gets what kind of thing.

1060
01:14:03,934 --> 01:14:06,415
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's some people that say they wanted to come to them, but

1061
01:14:06,799 --> 01:14:10,260
[SPEAKER_00]: quite frankly, it's the same pot of gold we just simply work with.

1062
01:14:10,621 --> 01:14:13,562
[SPEAKER_00]: But it could be $400,000, $500,000 that we could lose.

1063
01:14:14,102 --> 01:14:18,524
[SPEAKER_00]: And the state could lose that much more because they're dependent on it as well.

1064
01:14:19,104 --> 01:14:26,147
[SPEAKER_00]: And that could drive the cost of health care right through the roof, which will also impact our employees as they have to pay more for health insurance and the like.

1065
01:14:26,587 --> 01:14:27,047
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, that

1066
01:14:27,744 --> 01:14:35,549
[SPEAKER_00]: would bring them to the bargaining table, because next year, while we're covered for next year, bargaining for the successor contracts will start all over again.

1067
01:14:35,949 --> 01:14:42,973
[SPEAKER_00]: And as they lose money in terms of the health care costs and things of that type, they're going to be looking for something to make it up in salary.

1068
01:14:43,374 --> 01:14:49,357
[SPEAKER_00]: So all this stuff has triggers that are going to be thought about, planned.

1069
01:14:49,838 --> 01:14:51,619
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to understand what it means.

1070
01:14:52,239 --> 01:14:56,462
[SPEAKER_00]: When we commence something going forward, we've got to realize it might have ripple effect

1071
01:14:57,127 --> 01:14:58,267
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple years down the road.

1072
01:14:58,327 --> 01:14:59,828
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just, you know, any one year.

1073
01:14:59,868 --> 01:15:03,649
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that year, maybe, but then there's more going on down the road.

1074
01:15:04,589 --> 01:15:11,390
[SPEAKER_00]: And as it, as it stands now, we're, you know, we're using a lot of generated revenue to support our operations.

1075
01:15:12,311 --> 01:15:15,391
[SPEAKER_00]: Some point in time that generated revenue will hit a wall.

1076
01:15:15,851 --> 01:15:17,612
[SPEAKER_00]: We can only make so much at any given time.

1077
01:15:18,152 --> 01:15:23,433
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's all kinds of issues, but Washington, you know, is a, is a real black hole.

1078
01:15:23,473 --> 01:15:25,214
[SPEAKER_00]: You really don't know a lot of the programs.

1079
01:15:25,254 --> 01:15:26,674
[SPEAKER_00]: Title two is a,

1080
01:15:27,528 --> 01:15:29,109
[SPEAKER_00]: 150,000 go into salaries.

1081
01:15:29,969 --> 01:15:33,170
[SPEAKER_00]: That could disappear, you know, for class size reduction.

1082
01:15:34,490 --> 01:15:40,812
[SPEAKER_00]: Other programs like that for supplies, materials, bilingual, you know, money could come down.

1083
01:15:41,412 --> 01:15:44,633
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, our population is significantly growing in that area.

1084
01:15:46,574 --> 01:15:55,176
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, you know, I think the issue of, and I know it's unpopular, the millionaire's tax is out there someplace, whether that actually goes through in a year from now certainly would be helpful.

1085
01:15:56,033 --> 01:16:01,396
[SPEAKER_00]: to the revenue pie, but then again, if that money gets generated, who will get it?

1086
01:16:02,477 --> 01:16:09,000
[SPEAKER_00]: The issue of any money generated through the marijuana bill, sales taxes, other things like that, all up in the air.

1087
01:16:09,260 --> 01:16:11,302
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole group out there that want to cut the sales tax.

1088
01:16:11,902 --> 01:16:13,163
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to bring it back down again.

1089
01:16:13,763 --> 01:16:16,705
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of discussions that are going on right now.

1090
01:16:18,312 --> 01:16:19,974
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we've got to balance it all.

1091
01:16:20,014 --> 01:16:23,617
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I love it when people come up and say, we need this and need that.

1092
01:16:23,637 --> 01:16:28,961
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, you know, and I really respect that because they're telling, they're advocating for what they want and that you should.

1093
01:16:30,062 --> 01:16:38,730
[SPEAKER_00]: But then our job becomes how to balance it out, how to, how to do as much as we can and fairly apportionate to the things that, you know, they're important to us.

1094
01:16:41,610 --> 01:16:42,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Benedetto.

1095
01:16:42,390 --> 01:16:51,154
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to touch base on what my colleague was talking about, because I do mass health billing for the school I work at.

1096
01:16:51,694 --> 01:16:58,738
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's actually for speech therapy, physical therapy, occupational therapy.

1097
01:16:59,678 --> 01:17:03,340
[SPEAKER_06]: That's refunding for those services that we provide students.

1098
01:17:03,380 --> 01:17:08,482
[SPEAKER_06]: And instead of them going back to their doctor's office or outpatient visits, we do them in the schools.

1099
01:17:08,542 --> 01:17:10,603
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have those people in the schools so that they can not

1100
01:17:11,617 --> 01:17:15,878
[SPEAKER_06]: the children that specifically need it, but they're in the school, so they help all children.

1101
01:17:16,939 --> 01:17:25,441
[SPEAKER_06]: And when we don't receive those fundings, we're less likely to have funds to employ those type of people in our school systems.

1102
01:17:25,861 --> 01:17:26,882
[SPEAKER_06]: And it does matter.

1103
01:17:26,942 --> 01:17:40,326
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't think people realize it when you're just talking about funding being cut, unless you tell them how it affects our children every day, and the development and growth that people make early in their lives with OT, with speech,

1104
01:17:40,736 --> 01:17:47,139
[SPEAKER_06]: and the abundance of how quickly they learn and no longer need those services because they get them well.

1105
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:56,844
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you treat well and treat early is how I look at things, and then you don't have to treat later, you know, because you have the skills.

1106
01:17:56,924 --> 01:18:01,187
[SPEAKER_06]: You have mastered some of those skills, so you no longer need those services.

1107
01:18:01,687 --> 01:18:04,228
[SPEAKER_06]: But I just wanted it to be relatable.

1108
01:18:04,748 --> 01:18:05,909
[SPEAKER_06]: It matters to our children.

1109
01:18:06,029 --> 01:18:09,831
[SPEAKER_06]: It matters not only in dollars to our city, but it matters to services

1110
01:18:10,577 --> 01:18:12,858
[SPEAKER_06]: among our children, and that's what we're here for.

1111
01:18:14,739 --> 01:18:15,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.

1112
01:18:15,460 --> 01:18:18,121
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a motion to accept this report and place it on file?

1113
01:18:18,981 --> 01:18:19,462
[SPEAKER_05]: So moved.

1114
01:18:19,482 --> 01:18:20,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Seconded by Ms.

1115
01:18:20,202 --> 01:18:20,522
[SPEAKER_05]: Kretz.

1116
01:18:21,043 --> 01:18:21,803
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

1117
01:18:22,243 --> 01:18:22,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

1118
01:18:22,443 --> 01:18:23,144
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

1119
01:18:23,364 --> 01:18:24,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

1120
01:18:27,326 --> 01:18:28,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Negotiations and legal matters, none?

1121
01:18:29,427 --> 01:18:29,587
Right.

1122
01:18:31,746 --> 01:18:33,867
[SPEAKER_05]: On the back, we have school committee resolution.

1123
01:18:34,107 --> 01:18:38,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee expresses sincere condolences to the family of Irene Hagee.

1124
01:18:39,248 --> 01:18:45,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Mrs. Hagee was the mother of Carolyn Hagee, former administrative assistant to the superintendent and secretary to the school committee.

1125
01:18:46,110 --> 01:18:47,970
