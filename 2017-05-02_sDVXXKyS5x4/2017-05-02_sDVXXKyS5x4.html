    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=56.824s">They</a>  have ordered them. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=58.365s">We</a>  just don't have a date of delivery yet.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=92.906s">There</a>  is none.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=94.687s">Report</a>  of committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=95.488s">None.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=97.569s">Community</a>  participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=100.892s">Hearing</a>  and seeing none. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=102.86s">Report</a>  of the superintendent, report on Connors Scholarship Program. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=107.642s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=109.002s">Mayor</a>  and members of the school committee, you have heard undoubtedly about the Connors Scholarship Program. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=114.964s">It</a>  was created through the generosity of James and Thelma Connors. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=121.186s">You've</a>  got the information in front of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=124.147s">People</a>  of modest means or apparently of modest means until the very end when their investments became <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=132.303s">available</a>  to the city and through the work of Attorney John Granara, former Mayor Mike McGlynn, and Stephen Andrew. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=140.805s">It</a>  was put together into a scholarship program. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=144.506s">Amelia</a>  Jensen is here, our Director of Guidance, and she is reaching out to students to apply for this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=153.429s">The</a>  details are here, and happy to answer any questions you have. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=159.333s">rather</a>  than go through it, but it's obviously a very generous activity and we're pleased to have it.</p>

    <p>[7DUlBp6f_Us_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=165.081s">Hi,</a>  good evening, Mayor Burke, Superintendent Belson, and members of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=169.304s">We</a>  had a pretty successful turnout for students applying for the scholarship. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=173.427s">While</a>  we don't know exact final numbers, since we do not collect the scholarship applications, we've had between 50 to 60 students ask Councilors for the recommendation forms to be filled out. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=186.097s">So</a>  we expect at least 50 or 60 students to apply for the scholarship. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=190.84s">It's</a>  a wonderful scholarship. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=192.881s">Like</a>  Mr. Bellson said, there are $33,000 scholarships that could go to Medford students. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=200.324s">So</a>  we're really hoping that many from Medford High School will be able to be awarded. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=205.485s">Excellent.</a> </p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=207.206s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=207.366s">Disceri?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=207.926s">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=212.075s">This</a>  is such a wonderful thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=214.718s">It's</a>  like a dream come true for our Medford students. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=220.745s">Obviously,</a>  we can't express our appreciation to <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=224.768s">Jim</a>  and Thelma Connors, but we certainly owe them a huge debt of thanks for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=231.091s">And</a>  I appreciate all the people who are working on this to make sure that it is administered correctly and that our students will benefit. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=238.874s">I</a>  do hope that we receive a list of all the students who receive them.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=243.295s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=244.016s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=245.116s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=246.617s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=248.734s">I</a>  just want to thank your office for taking on this responsibility and getting this information out to our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=255.4s">I</a>  hope it helps a lot of students that normally wouldn't get a high end scholarship because the GPA is very reasonable and it's for the average working hard student and I'm really glad to see that.</p>

    <p>[7DUlBp6f_Us_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=274.232s">One</a>  of the, yeah, I'm sorry.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=275.273s">Thank</a>  you for your office and your help.</p>

    <p>[7DUlBp6f_Us_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=276.514s">Oh,</a>  you're welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=277.194s">One</a>  of, um, one of the things that was really exciting about this scholarship is although they'd look at academic record and demonstrated leadership, um, they also look at work experience and any type of hardships that students have overcome and, um, they weigh those things somewhat equally. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=293.067s">Um,</a>  so some of our students who may have had to take a job to help support family or take care of their siblings, um, aren't going to be ruled out for the scholarship. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=302.414s">Excellent.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=302.775s">Amazing.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=304.074s">Miss</a>  Kurtz. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=305.154s">Oh,</a>  hi. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=305.754s">Thank</a>  you, Miss Jensen. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=306.915s">This</a>  is a great report. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=308.955s">I</a>  don't want to duplicate what Aaron said, but I was going to say that, you know, I thought it was a really fair grade point average where it ranged from two point three to higher levels, which is good for some students who might not be at the same grade level as others. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=324.759s">And</a>  it's just a wonderful, generous opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=327.513s">for</a>  our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=328.953s">Thank</a>  you very much for the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=330.214s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=332.554s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=332.754s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=334.115s">Thank</a>  you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=334.575s">Jensen,</a>  to you and to your staff for being involved in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=339.116s">I</a>  hope, though, that as the students are applying for this scholarship, they really understand how they're receiving this money. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=345.657s">I</a>  think there's a huge lesson here. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=347.078s">This</a>  is just, it's an incredible story. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=350.278s">It</a>  really is. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=351.059s">And</a>  for people that are listening and maybe don't know the whole story, the bottom line is that <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=357.321s">We</a>  had two people in our own city that lived very modestly and have now given, you know, they were over, like, the modest life yields, $4 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=370.406s">That's</a>  a huge lesson. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=372.286s">And</a>  the lesson I hope that our students get from this and for everyone, actually, that listens is this is why you always treat everybody equally, because you just don't know what happens and what's underneath anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=381.49s">And</a>  to read the story, it was just a fabulous story. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=383.791s">I</a>  actually shared it a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=385.448s">today</a>  with some people that I work with, and they said, I hope the city really promotes this story, because not only what they have done, but also to give the opportunity to all students, because sometimes students don't feel that they could apply for all scholarships. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=404.258s">And</a>  this is something really tremendous, but I thank you.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=407.92s">It</a>  is wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=409.638s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=410.058s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=410.819s">Is</a>  there a motion to receive in place on file? <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=413.14s">Motion</a>  to receive in place on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=414.76s">Seconded</a>  by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=415.441s">Van</a>  der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=416.281s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=417.502s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=417.722s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=418.502s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=420.703s">Report</a>  on class of 2017 college university acceptances.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=424.885s">Making</a>  a return appearance is Amelia Jensen to tell you about the college acceptances to date. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=430.308s">This</a>  is still preliminary, but we wanted to give you a sense of what was happening out there for the time being.</p>

    <p>[7DUlBp6f_Us_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=435.466s">Yes,</a>  so the students inform the guidance department. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=437.927s">Their</a>  deadline is May 11. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=439.387s">And</a>  they inform us of all of the places that they were accepted, as well as where they have chosen to go, and their post-secondary plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=448.689s">So</a>  right now, again, this is preliminary numbers, but we've had 220 students report that they have been accepted to over 225 different colleges and universities. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=458.712s">And</a>  there should be an attachment that lists all of the colleges and universities. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=463.633s">I</a>  did want to highlight a few because this was an exceptional year. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=467.138s">We</a>  have had a student get into Brown University, Duke University, Harvard, Tufts University, Wellesley College, Yale University, all of the UMass schools, and many, many state schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=479.616s">and</a>  many more schools that you can look at on the attached sheet. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=484.297s">We</a>  also have some students who are waitlisted at some pretty good schools, so we're still waiting to hear if they have been accepted. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=490.239s">Decision</a>  day is May 1st, so students will be making that decision, or should have already made that decision, and again should be letting us know where they're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=499.527s">So</a>  that's where we stand with colleges. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=503.912s">Many</a>  students also have received scholarships and awards already. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=508.076s">We</a>  had one student who became a national merit finalist. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=512.0s">One</a>  student won a Posse scholarship, which is a full-ride scholarship, and this student will be attending Bucknell University. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=518.91s">We</a>  had a student receive a Fulbright scholarship to Duke University because of soccer, one to Tufts University because of academics, and many more. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=527.116s">So</a>  again, that's also a list that we will be collecting. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=532.319s">Two</a>  Medford vocational technical students are currently enrolled in apprenticeship programs at night to become plumbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=539.024s">So</a>  what they're doing is they're already a year ahead of their peers. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=542.146s">So</a>  they're going to school during the day and at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=545.389s">So</a>  that is also very exceptional. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=548.15s">And</a>  this was the first year that many students, I believe over 35 students, have chosen alternative post-secondary plans and options for their future. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=559.293s">And</a>  by this, what I mean is these are students who have below a 2.5 GPA and historically would not have been accepted to a four-year school, so they would have gone to community college or they would have chosen some other route. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=573.976s">Instead</a>  of that, we were able to offer them other programs and opportunities through the Rockland Earn and Learn program, Year Up, Match Beyond, and many more. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=584.342s">And</a>  what these programs offer is work experience and scholarships to go to college. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=592.367s">And</a>  I can go into more detail if you have specific questions on this.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=596.93s">Very</a>  good.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=598.191s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=600.463s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=600.683s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=601.504s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=602.085s">Thank</a>  you again, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=602.805s">Jensen,</a>  for this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=604.327s">Again,</a>  extremely proud of our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=609.051s">And</a>  I just encourage, I know that we did it last year for the graduation pamphlet, if we could add this on to the graduation pamphlet again. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=616.478s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=617.88s">And</a>  maybe even a little bit of the, you know, where the students <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=622.042s">that</a>  received a couple of scholarships, just to give an idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=626.085s">And</a>  the reason I say that is that we had had this discussion, I was on the psych council for the high school and the vocational school for many years, and what happened is that our students do get accepted to great schools, but sometimes, because of financial reasons, they choose other schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=643.935s">I</a>  heard people in the audience that were saying, oh, our Medford students are all going to this school or that school. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=649.801s">And</a>  I'm not saying that one school is better than the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=652.284s">But</a>  they were leaving the graduation just thinking that our students were going to particular schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=657.689s">And</a>  when I, when we approached it, <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=660.66s">we</a>  said it's not fair to the students because parents or relatives that come or people that just come to the graduation or just see where our students end up going doesn't necessarily mean that's where they've only been accepted to. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=672.79s">So</a>  I think it's very important for the school but also for the students to let people know how hard they've worked and where they've been accepted to.</p>

    <p>[7DUlBp6f_Us_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=681.517s">Yes,</a>  we definitely plan on putting that on the graduation booklet. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=684.059s">I</a>  agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=684.44s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=686.71s">Just</a>  out of curiosity, do you know how many students have been accepted to Tufts University this year?</p>

    <p>[7DUlBp6f_Us_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=693.332s">Seven</a>  or nine. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=696.093s">Yeah,</a>  the last time I heard, I thought it was seven, but it could have, there could be more.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=700.234s">I</a>  think there were seven accepted and there were multiple wait lists. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=705.035s">Okay,</a>  so we're still waiting to hear on this.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=707.156s">Good</a>  to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=707.916s">I</a>  really, since we have one of the best colleges in the world here in our city, I really like <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=716.162s">that</a>  partnership with Tufts University. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=718.623s">And</a>  I know that they look closely at taking both Method and some of those students. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=722.984s">So</a>  I'm just always curious as to how many get accepted and then how many can afford to go after that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=728.766s">And</a>  I know that Tufts can be generous at times with our students, having a daughter who graduated from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=737.229s">But</a>  also because I want to keep that opportunity for our children in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=743.971s">I</a>  mean, it's a great <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=745.173s">It's</a>  like a world-renowned school now. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=747.615s">And</a>  it's got people from all over the world coming.</p>

    <p>[7DUlBp6f_Us_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=751.678s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=752.019s">They've</a>  been working very well with our department. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=753.96s">They</a>  reach out to us monthly. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=757.703s">They</a>  ask for names of students who are on the Honor Society. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=761.607s">And</a>  they do personal outreach to our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=763.528s">So</a>  they're very good with our population. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=767.412s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=768.492s">Mr.</a>  Skerry.</p>
