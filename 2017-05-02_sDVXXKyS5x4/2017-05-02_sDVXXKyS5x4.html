    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=56.824s">They</a>  have ordered them. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=58.365s">We</a>  just don't have a date of delivery yet.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=92.906s">There</a>  is none.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=94.687s">Report</a>  of committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=95.488s">None.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=97.569s">Community</a>  participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=100.892s">Hearing</a>  and seeing none. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=102.86s">Report</a>  of the superintendent, report on Connors Scholarship Program. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=107.642s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=109.002s">Mayor</a>  and members of the school committee, you have heard undoubtedly about the Connors Scholarship Program. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=114.964s">It</a>  was created through the generosity of James and Thelma Connors. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=121.186s">You've</a>  got the information in front of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=124.147s">People</a>  of modest means or apparently of modest means until the very end when their investments became <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=132.303s">available</a>  to the city and through the work of Attorney John Granara, former Mayor Mike McGlynn, and Stephen Andrew. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=140.805s">It</a>  was put together into a scholarship program. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=144.506s">Amelia</a>  Jensen is here, our Director of Guidance, and she is reaching out to students to apply for this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=153.429s">The</a>  details are here, and happy to answer any questions you have. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=159.333s">rather</a>  than go through it, but it's obviously a very generous activity and we're pleased to have it.</p>

    <p>[7DUlBp6f_Us_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=165.081s">Hi,</a>  good evening, Mayor Burke, Superintendent Belson, and members of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=169.304s">We</a>  had a pretty successful turnout for students applying for the scholarship. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=173.427s">While</a>  we don't know exact final numbers, since we do not collect the scholarship applications, we've had between 50 to 60 students ask Councilors for the recommendation forms to be filled out. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=186.097s">So</a>  we expect at least 50 or 60 students to apply for the scholarship. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=190.84s">It's</a>  a wonderful scholarship. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=192.881s">Like</a>  Mr. Bellson said, there are $33,000 scholarships that could go to Medford students. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=200.324s">So</a>  we're really hoping that many from Medford High School will be able to be awarded. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=205.485s">Excellent.</a> </p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=207.206s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=207.366s">Disceri?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=207.926s">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=212.075s">This</a>  is such a wonderful thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=214.718s">It's</a>  like a dream come true for our Medford students. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=220.745s">Obviously,</a>  we can't express our appreciation to <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=224.768s">Jim</a>  and Thelma Connors, but we certainly owe them a huge debt of thanks for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=231.091s">And</a>  I appreciate all the people who are working on this to make sure that it is administered correctly and that our students will benefit. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=238.874s">I</a>  do hope that we receive a list of all the students who receive them.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=243.295s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=244.016s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=245.116s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=246.617s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=248.734s">I</a>  just want to thank your office for taking on this responsibility and getting this information out to our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=255.4s">I</a>  hope it helps a lot of students that normally wouldn't get a high end scholarship because the GPA is very reasonable and it's for the average working hard student and I'm really glad to see that.</p>

    <p>[7DUlBp6f_Us_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=274.232s">One</a>  of the, yeah, I'm sorry.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=275.273s">Thank</a>  you for your office and your help.</p>

    <p>[7DUlBp6f_Us_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=276.514s">Oh,</a>  you're welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=277.194s">One</a>  of, um, one of the things that was really exciting about this scholarship is although they'd look at academic record and demonstrated leadership, um, they also look at work experience and any type of hardships that students have overcome and, um, they weigh those things somewhat equally. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=293.067s">Um,</a>  so some of our students who may have had to take a job to help support family or take care of their siblings, um, aren't going to be ruled out for the scholarship. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=302.414s">Excellent.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=302.775s">Amazing.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=304.074s">Miss</a>  Kurtz. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=305.154s">Oh,</a>  hi. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=305.754s">Thank</a>  you, Miss Jensen. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=306.915s">This</a>  is a great report. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=308.955s">I</a>  don't want to duplicate what Aaron said, but I was going to say that, you know, I thought it was a really fair grade point average where it ranged from two point three to higher levels, which is good for some students who might not be at the same grade level as others. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=324.759s">And</a>  it's just a wonderful, generous opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=327.513s">for</a>  our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=328.953s">Thank</a>  you very much for the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=330.214s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=332.554s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=332.754s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=334.115s">Thank</a>  you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=334.575s">Jensen,</a>  to you and to your staff for being involved in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=339.116s">I</a>  hope, though, that as the students are applying for this scholarship, they really understand how they're receiving this money. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=345.657s">I</a>  think there's a huge lesson here. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=347.078s">This</a>  is just, it's an incredible story. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=350.278s">It</a>  really is. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=351.059s">And</a>  for people that are listening and maybe don't know the whole story, the bottom line is that <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=357.321s">We</a>  had two people in our own city that lived very modestly and have now given, you know, they were over, like, the modest life yields, $4 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=370.406s">That's</a>  a huge lesson. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=372.286s">And</a>  the lesson I hope that our students get from this and for everyone, actually, that listens is this is why you always treat everybody equally, because you just don't know what happens and what's underneath anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=381.49s">And</a>  to read the story, it was just a fabulous story. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=383.791s">I</a>  actually shared it a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=385.448s">today</a>  with some people that I work with, and they said, I hope the city really promotes this story, because not only what they have done, but also to give the opportunity to all students, because sometimes students don't feel that they could apply for all scholarships. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=404.258s">And</a>  this is something really tremendous, but I thank you.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=407.92s">It</a>  is wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=409.638s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=410.058s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=410.819s">Is</a>  there a motion to receive in place on file? <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=413.14s">Motion</a>  to receive in place on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=414.76s">Seconded</a>  by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=415.441s">Van</a>  der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=416.281s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=417.502s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=417.722s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=418.502s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=420.703s">Report</a>  on class of 2017 college university acceptances.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=424.885s">Making</a>  a return appearance is Amelia Jensen to tell you about the college acceptances to date. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=430.308s">This</a>  is still preliminary, but we wanted to give you a sense of what was happening out there for the time being.</p>

    <p>[7DUlBp6f_Us_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=435.466s">Yes,</a>  so the students inform the guidance department. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=437.927s">Their</a>  deadline is May 11. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=439.387s">And</a>  they inform us of all of the places that they were accepted, as well as where they have chosen to go, and their post-secondary plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=448.689s">So</a>  right now, again, this is preliminary numbers, but we've had 220 students report that they have been accepted to over 225 different colleges and universities. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=458.712s">And</a>  there should be an attachment that lists all of the colleges and universities. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=463.633s">I</a>  did want to highlight a few because this was an exceptional year. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=467.138s">We</a>  have had a student get into Brown University, Duke University, Harvard, Tufts University, Wellesley College, Yale University, all of the UMass schools, and many, many state schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=479.616s">and</a>  many more schools that you can look at on the attached sheet. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=484.297s">We</a>  also have some students who are waitlisted at some pretty good schools, so we're still waiting to hear if they have been accepted. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=490.239s">Decision</a>  day is May 1st, so students will be making that decision, or should have already made that decision, and again should be letting us know where they're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=499.527s">So</a>  that's where we stand with colleges. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=503.912s">Many</a>  students also have received scholarships and awards already. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=508.076s">We</a>  had one student who became a national merit finalist. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=512.0s">One</a>  student won a Posse scholarship, which is a full-ride scholarship, and this student will be attending Bucknell University. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=518.91s">We</a>  had a student receive a Fulbright scholarship to Duke University because of soccer, one to Tufts University because of academics, and many more. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=527.116s">So</a>  again, that's also a list that we will be collecting. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=532.319s">Two</a>  Medford vocational technical students are currently enrolled in apprenticeship programs at night to become plumbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=539.024s">So</a>  what they're doing is they're already a year ahead of their peers. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=542.146s">So</a>  they're going to school during the day and at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=545.389s">So</a>  that is also very exceptional. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=548.15s">And</a>  this was the first year that many students, I believe over 35 students, have chosen alternative post-secondary plans and options for their future. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=559.293s">And</a>  by this, what I mean is these are students who have below a 2.5 GPA and historically would not have been accepted to a four-year school, so they would have gone to community college or they would have chosen some other route. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=573.976s">Instead</a>  of that, we were able to offer them other programs and opportunities through the Rockland Earn and Learn program, Year Up, Match Beyond, and many more. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=584.342s">And</a>  what these programs offer is work experience and scholarships to go to college. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=592.367s">And</a>  I can go into more detail if you have specific questions on this.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=596.93s">Very</a>  good.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=598.191s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=600.463s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=600.683s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=601.504s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=602.085s">Thank</a>  you again, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=602.805s">Jensen,</a>  for this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=604.327s">Again,</a>  extremely proud of our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=609.051s">And</a>  I just encourage, I know that we did it last year for the graduation pamphlet, if we could add this on to the graduation pamphlet again. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=616.478s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=617.88s">And</a>  maybe even a little bit of the, you know, where the students <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=622.042s">that</a>  received a couple of scholarships, just to give an idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=626.085s">And</a>  the reason I say that is that we had had this discussion, I was on the psych council for the high school and the vocational school for many years, and what happened is that our students do get accepted to great schools, but sometimes, because of financial reasons, they choose other schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=643.935s">I</a>  heard people in the audience that were saying, oh, our Medford students are all going to this school or that school. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=649.801s">And</a>  I'm not saying that one school is better than the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=652.284s">But</a>  they were leaving the graduation just thinking that our students were going to particular schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=657.689s">And</a>  when I, when we approached it, <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=660.66s">we</a>  said it's not fair to the students because parents or relatives that come or people that just come to the graduation or just see where our students end up going doesn't necessarily mean that's where they've only been accepted to. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=672.79s">So</a>  I think it's very important for the school but also for the students to let people know how hard they've worked and where they've been accepted to.</p>

    <p>[7DUlBp6f_Us_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=681.517s">Yes,</a>  we definitely plan on putting that on the graduation booklet. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=684.059s">I</a>  agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=684.44s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=686.71s">Just</a>  out of curiosity, do you know how many students have been accepted to Tufts University this year?</p>

    <p>[7DUlBp6f_Us_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=693.332s">Seven</a>  or nine. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=696.093s">Yeah,</a>  the last time I heard, I thought it was seven, but it could have, there could be more.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=700.234s">I</a>  think there were seven accepted and there were multiple wait lists. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=705.035s">Okay,</a>  so we're still waiting to hear on this.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=707.156s">Good</a>  to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=707.916s">I</a>  really, since we have one of the best colleges in the world here in our city, I really like <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=716.162s">that</a>  partnership with Tufts University. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=718.623s">And</a>  I know that they look closely at taking both Method and some of those students. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=722.984s">So</a>  I'm just always curious as to how many get accepted and then how many can afford to go after that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=728.766s">And</a>  I know that Tufts can be generous at times with our students, having a daughter who graduated from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=737.229s">But</a>  also because I want to keep that opportunity for our children in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=743.971s">I</a>  mean, it's a great <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=745.173s">It's</a>  like a world-renowned school now. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=747.615s">And</a>  it's got people from all over the world coming.</p>

    <p>[7DUlBp6f_Us_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=751.678s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=752.019s">They've</a>  been working very well with our department. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=753.96s">They</a>  reach out to us monthly. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=757.703s">They</a>  ask for names of students who are on the Honor Society. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=761.607s">And</a>  they do personal outreach to our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=763.528s">So</a>  they're very good with our population. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=767.412s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=768.492s">Mr.</a>  Skerry.</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=769.638s">Has</a>  the guidance office been apprised of any students who received substantial scholarships to go to their schools?</p>

    <p>[7DUlBp6f_Us_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=776.161s">Not</a>  yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=776.642s">So</a>  they'll fill that information out when they get their graduation caps and gowns, which is mid-May.</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=782.225s">OK,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=782.825s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[7DUlBp6f_Us_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=784.366s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=784.546s">van</a>  de Kloot.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=785.646s">No,</a>  I just, it's always nice to see the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=788.668s">It's</a>  particularly nice to see that we've got a student accepted into Yale this year, because that's a very difficult school to have an acceptance. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=796.412s">So</a>  I was particularly happy to see <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=798.39s">that</a>  a Medford student had made it to Yale.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=800.391s">Yeah,</a>  I think it's been a while since that's happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=803.451s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=803.911s">There's</a>  a motion to receive and place on file by Mr. Skerry, seconded by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=807.933s">Cunha.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=808.333s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=809.793s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=810.533s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=812.134s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=812.814s">Thank</a>  you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=813.254s">Jensen.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=814.114s">Report</a>  on opiate prevention grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=816.035s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=816.875s">So</a>  I think we all realize that the opiate issue is becoming very, very substantial. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=823.057s">It</a>  has been very substantial. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=824.217s">The</a>  Massachusetts amount of opiate exceeds the national aperture. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=829.058s">So</a>  for opiate deaths and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=831.259s">And</a>  it affects marriages, it affects jobs, families, neighborhoods, and all kinds of things out there that are not good. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=840.362s">So</a>  through the work of Tony and Rachel, we have another grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=846.184s">And</a>  I'll let them explain it because I think it's a really good item for us right now.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=851.685s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=852.006s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=852.526s">Bento?</a> </p>

    <p>[Toni Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=853.186s">Good</a>  evening, Mayor Burke, Superintendent, and school committee members. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=856.921s">Rachel</a>  and I are here to talk about the Youth Opioid Prevention Grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=861.224s">This</a>  grant was funded by a settlement with CVS and Walgreen over fraudulent practices around opioid prescriptions. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=871.572s">And</a>  Attorney General Maura Healey used $500,000 to fund the program, and they were looking for programs that would address the opioid addiction and dependence. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=886.63s">programs</a>  that would be sustainable. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=888.711s">So</a>  we're very happy to announce that we were awarded $18,000 for our programs here to augment the many different things we've been doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=900.396s">But</a>  we're really focusing now on building skills, as Rachel will talk about, with our younger elementary students.</p>

    <p>[Rachel Perry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=909.719s">All</a>  right, so we're looking to use the grant funding kind of a four-prong approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=914.681s">First,</a>  education of our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=916.93s">education</a>  of our faculty, education of our parents, and education of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=923.034s">The</a>  first thing we're looking to do is purchase more Michigan model kits. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=926.977s">At</a>  this point, we have kits at the elementary schools, but they are shared between the teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=932.261s">By</a>  using this money, we can purchase one kit for every teacher so that they all have all of their own kits, all of their own information. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=939.746s">We'd</a>  also like to provide yearly parent education forums about substance use and prevention, <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=948.308s">We'd</a>  also like to do faculty training on identification of substance use, risky behaviors, and preventative strategies. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=954.793s">That</a>  would be a yearly training that we would offer. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=958.175s">Increasing</a>  community awareness by having resources for education and student support actually posted on our school website, our health website, that will help people in the community that are looking for information. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=969.784s">And</a>  then strengthening our partnerships with community organizations. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=975.004s">the</a>  youth soccer leagues, the youth basketball leagues, working with their coaches to actually teach them some of the information within the Michigan model so they can share it with their athletes and with their parents as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=987.326s">We</a>  will be assessing the program as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=989.587s">We're</a>  going to actually start to look at the survey results for the communities that care survey so we can make a comparison 2017 and 2019 to see what we have done, see if it has made a difference within the survey results. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1004.568s">And</a>  we'll also be assessing each program. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1006.489s">We'll</a>  have surveys after each program is done to kind of assess how it went and where we're going from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1013.914s">And</a>  then we'll also be doing pre and post assessments of the Michigan model.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1017.517s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1018.117s">Excellent</a>  work. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1018.977s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1019.318s">Thank</a>  you so much.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1021.479s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1022.38s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1023.24s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1024.061s">$18,000</a>  towards educational services regarding drug addiction in any way, shape, or form. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1031.566s">There's</a>  money coming in, and we don't <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1034.701s">I'm</a>  really happy to see that they've allocated funds throughout the community, and we were recipient of such a large sum. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1042.705s">I</a>  just wanted to talk to you a little bit about working with Penny from the city side, because she's an amazing, and her department is amazing.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1049.588s">They</a>  do work very closely now.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1051.729s">So</a>  she might have some ideas.</p>

    <p>[Toni Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1054.71s">Penny</a>  sat on the planning board when we wrote this grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1058.952s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1059.272s">So</a>  we were able to listen to her, <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1063.044s">feedback</a>  about it and she was very helpful for us in putting together the application. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1069.906s">They</a>  also funded our parent forum with Dr. Ruth Poteet that we had a couple weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1077.268s">So</a>  we were very pleased to be able to do that for our community.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1082.329s">My</a>  other only suggestion is as far as the community piece, we have a group in the community, Method Against Addiction, and it's really well run and well <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1092.035s">developed</a>  and they really have the hands on what's happening in that community. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1097.836s">So</a>  I would reach out to that group as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1101.417s">I</a>  mean, they're phenomenal and they're very receptive and very helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1105.198s">And</a>  my last piece is for the parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1108.519s">I</a>  know that Cheryl just received an award from the- Citizen of the Year. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1113.66s">Citizen</a>  of the Year. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1114.46s">And</a>  I've attended her, I've been to her group to observe what goes on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1120.762s">And</a>  it's for the parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1122.49s">of</a>  people who are addicted. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1124.071s">And</a>  everybody thinks it's the older. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1126.032s">It</a>  could also be students within our district. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1131.114s">And</a>  just get that perspective as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1134.515s">So</a>  you're getting both the school, the city side, the great program, Method Against Addiction, which brings people together, make them feel like a family. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1146.14s">And</a>  you're also getting adults that are struggling with, how do I cope with this? <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1150.96s">type</a>  of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1151.56s">So</a>  we could really, you know, unite as one with, I know it's only 18,000, but that's, that's a good amount of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1158.203s">And</a>  it's just some different ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1159.584s">Cause</a>  if you do an outreach, speak to the people that you're going to outreach to, the parents, the people in the citizen street, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1168.445s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1169.365s">I</a>  just want to add a couple of comments that I just heard at the start. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1173.386s">It's</a>  way beyond a start. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1175.866s">We've</a>  been spending a lot of money, a lot of commitment to this topic from a city perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1181.027s">And</a>  I know that Penny and her team, there's quite a few that are part of her team now, and they do outreach, they do coaching, they connect people with beds if need be to get them in for treatment, and the post. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1193.35s">So</a>  there's a lot going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1195.833s">I</a>  know you've been working closely with them as it is, so keep up the good work. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1198.934s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1199.294s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1200.554s">Good</a>  grant.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1201.195s">One</a>  more thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1202.055s">Oh,</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1204.535s">Can</a>  she just finish? <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1206.836s">So</a>  I also, uh, about two years ago, the governor had, um, people come out to the community and I went to a few of the meetings, um, they were in Somerville and they were trying to figure out what the state needed to do as a team and they, <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1221.028s">They</a>  were talking about mandates for schools and stuff and I rose my hand and I was like, are they going to be funded mandates or are they going to be burdened to the cities? <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1229.217s">And</a>  I was assured that of course they would be funded mandates. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1232.837s">But</a>  I haven't seen those mandates yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1234.758s">And</a>  I was wondering if the superintendent had gotten any mandates yet from. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1238.86s">Funded</a>  mandates. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1240.461s">Or</a>  unfunded.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1242.783s">The</a>  word fun is not really a good way to begin the word funded.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1247.445s">Or</a>  even unfunded. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1248.386s">Are</a>  there any new mandates within the school district?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1250.807s">There</a>  will be several.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1251.707s">But</a>  they haven't come out yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1252.888s">The</a>  governor was doing.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1253.608s">They're</a>  starting to emerge right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1255.329s">Because</a>  I think the biggest thing you have to understand is a lot of things coming out, but they're always underfunded. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1260.531s">You</a>  know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1261.412s">So</a>  there's a few dollars put to them, but then there's not enough to really carry them out. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1264.794s">You'll</a>  see some of the budget report that we're going to talk about.</p>

    <p>[Toni Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1268.276s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1268.536s">And</a>  I mean, one of them recently was the expert screening that the training was funded for. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1273.319s">Um,</a>  but we were able to conduct the screening at no cost to the district, just using our resources that we have in the health services and guidance counseling, um, departments.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1284.123s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1285.003s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1285.323s">Van</a>  der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1285.984s">I</a>  just want to thank you both for writing the grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1291.725s">I</a>  wanted to, since you mentioned her,</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1311.222s">that</a>  I know Mrs. Kreatz and myself were able to attend Dr. Ruth Pote's talk, which was just exceptional. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1320.324s">Everybody</a>  in the audience who, and I've talked to people since, have said it was one of the best things that they've attended. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1326.065s">I</a>  hope that at some point we might be able to bring her back again. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1329.765s">She</a>  truly was, it was a wonderful event and I'm so glad that I was able to attend.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1334.926s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1335.326s">I'm</a>  glad you enjoyed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1337.427s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1337.627s">Kreatz.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1338.7s">I</a>  wanted to mention that I went to the forum, you know, with Paula and I, and it was just amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1343.544s">And</a>  she was a great, great speaker. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1345.025s">And</a>  everybody was so engaged. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1346.886s">It</a>  was wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1348.347s">This</a>  is a great grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1349.488s">It's</a>  just terrific. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1351.509s">And</a>  I love how there's going to be more parent forums and more facility training, increased community awareness. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1359.635s">And</a>  I just wanted to make sure, because I know when the original grant was written, the expenses added up to $20,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1365.159s">So</a>  I wanted to make sure that <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1368.057s">there</a>  was going to be enough funding available, or if you had to add something to the budget this year, so that you could continue with the new teacher training and prevention, the presentations. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1381.566s">I</a>  wasn't sure if, you know, was this like kind of a little bit of an estimate, or do you think you'll find out?</p>

    <p>[Toni Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1388.311s">No,</a>  this is the grant, the total that we will receive. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1391.973s">But</a>  we looked through, and we were able to slim down on some administrative costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1397.996s">Because</a>  I just want to make sure that you get to put through everything that you want to put through because it's so wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1403.844s">The</a>  most important piece of it, the Michigan model kits we kept because that really starts building the foundation at the kindergarten level.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1412.738s">I</a>  just want to say again, as my colleagues have said, thank you for your hard work and for getting us this grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1421.403s">I</a>  know that you have collaborated with different organizations. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1425.086s">I'm</a>  just curious in knowing, I know that the city council has their meetings once a month with the police chief and the police department, and they're going from one community, well, one part of our city to another. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1438.134s">And</a>  I was just curious if <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1439.575s">If</a>  it was something that you guys have ever attended, maybe just to get the word out of when you're going to have a parent meeting?</p>

    <p>[Toni Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1446.638s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1448.279s">We</a>  attended and did a presentation a couple of years ago at a city council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1454.782s">I</a>  also attend a monthly National Alliance of Mental Illness meeting that is held at the police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1462.166s">So</a>  we share a lot of ideas at that monthly meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1465.767s">Stacey</a>  Shulman also attends with me from the school side.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1469.445s">This</a>  wasn't necessarily just to show it to the city council, but where they're having their meetings in the different sections of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1475.207s">I</a>  know your schedules are, you know, they're piled as it is, but just to like, you don't have to stay there the whole night, but just to get the word out, maybe when they do have their meetings of giving them <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1486.154s">the</a>  information of what you're working on, maybe the next time you are having a parent meeting, or when you're scheduling a yearly meeting, just to, even if you could bring a flyer, or just give it to the chief and have him bring it to those meetings, just to get the word out again.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1501.747s">The</a>  police chief has been having community meetings the first Wednesday of every month, ongoing for years and years and years. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1508.353s">What</a>  he's done differently now is he's actually going into the neighborhoods to host them. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1512.698s">So</a>  people, a little more localized, but I believe it's Wednesday night at 6 at the senior center.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1518.523s">This</a>  week it's going to be tomorrow night. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1520.385s">Senior</a>  center at 6, Wednesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1521.967s">Wednesday.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1522.367s">Today's</a>  Tuesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1523.088s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1523.889s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1592.09s">So</a>  this report we commissioned earlier this year to get us a robust look at our network and all the infrastructure that's necessary to support the expanded use of technology in the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1604.754s">And</a>  what you have is, I think, a very thorough report. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1608.476s">It</a>  gives us <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1610.158s">some</a>  pathways to pursue and strengthen our capacities to use technology efficiently. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1615.6s">It</a>  also enables us to access our tier two funding in support of upgrades. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1621.341s">These</a>  reports, as I mentioned, are very technical and extensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1625.542s">But</a>  they're provided to you so that you can take your time to go through them and perhaps develop a deeper understanding of the complexity it will take to integrate technology into our programs in the public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1638.863s">The</a>  recommendations provide several key steps that we can take without a burdensome cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1643.905s">Some</a>  of these things are just doable. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1645.505s">We</a>  just have to do them. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1647.166s">And</a>  still, it's important for us to recognize that there are heavy requirements of testing, state reporting, electronic data management. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1654.248s">Communication</a>  requires we have finely tuned, robust, and reliable capacity to meet our obligations. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1659.549s">And</a>  also, well, it's not part of this report, some staffing that has to be done so that we can maintain these systems the way we need to. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1668.857s">This</a>  is not a one-time thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1670.899s">We'll</a>  do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1671.379s">It'll</a>  be with us for a while in terms of the infrastructure, but there'll be many upgrades that will always be required as more things are added and more people are trying to do things and more devices are played with. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1684.249s">But</a>  this is a very, very good investment. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1687.451s">So</a>  I recommend, first of all, that you would read the executive summaries because that gives you enough of a background to understand what's being involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1695.998s">Additionally,</a>  you'll find some materials that talk about the category two E-rate funding estimates. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1702.38s">And</a>  under this program, we can access $398,100 of federal funds with a $265,000, $400 match. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1712.402s">We're</a>  currently soliciting bids and completing E-rate applications. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1716.543s">We</a>  will seek capital funding to meet this infrastructure need in the weeks ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1723.518s">It's</a>  clear that other things need to be done in terms of devices and equipment, but that's not part of this particular activity. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1732.74s">If</a>  we don't do it this year, I have a feeling some of this stuff may not be available to school systems or libraries next year because of some of the domestic cutbacks that are being considered in Washington. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1744.143s">So</a>  I'd like to act on this now. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1746.543s">I'd</a>  like to let you know that we're working actively on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1751.885s">Christine</a>  is working closely. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1754.04s">uh,</a>  on the financial part and on the technical part as well with Steve Kelly of tech edge and, uh, look forward to moving this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1762.926s">Happy</a>  to take any questions and Christine's here as well.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1768.67s">Yes,</a>  that I had, um, an opportunity to review this report in detail and I did look at all of the, uh, findings and although there was much that I didn't understand as, as a novice in this area, there were other parts that just make common sense as they were talking about, <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1784.491s">you</a>  know, areas where all of a sudden it would get too crowded, if you would, and somehow or another it just seemed one of the most comprehensive and clearly it's something we need to move ahead on. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1798.3s">Is</a>  the next appropriate step to have a committee of the whole to review this?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1803.122s">Well,</a>  we can do that if you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1804.723s">Do</a>  we need to? <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1805.284s">We</a>  certainly, you know, want to move forward because, you know, we want to be able to file our applications and <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1811.285s">and</a>  take advantage of bids that are out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1812.986s">But</a>  if you want to come into the hall, we can schedule it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1814.907s">We</a>  do are going to have a very busy schedule in the month of May and early June because of a number of things, including school council reports and the like, but happy to schedule it if this is what you want to do.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1824.451s">Personally,</a>  I'm comfortable with just moving at authorizing the administration to move ahead.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1829.193s">If</a>  my colleagues are, we would still have to come back for a formal vote in any case and then send it for an appropriation paper to the city council.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1840.718s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1841.299s">Is</a>  there a motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1843.802s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1845.363s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1847.646s">So</a>  this is the recommendation that we have to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1852.731s">And</a>  if we move forward with this, we would need to receive $265,400 match. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1856.294s">And</a>  we would get close to $400,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1857.416s">That's</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1857.836s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1864.242s">I</a>  also would like to know what we're budgeting in addition to this on an annual basis to make sure that we're also making a commitment on a line item in our budget as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1874.744s">Because</a>  this, like we did the $3 million bond a few years ago for technology and then we had a few slow years and then we're asking for more. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1884.246s">What</a>  I'd like to see is a commitment to technology throughout our system throughout every year so that way we don't, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1892.673s">when</a>  these opportunities arise, it's for bonus stuff, not the everyday stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1897.474s">Do</a>  you understand what I'm saying, superintendent?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1900.575s">So</a>  what our plans are internally, of course, we're still refining them somewhat because we still have to figure out how much money is available to us operationally. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1909.517s">But</a>  we will plan to buy devices with a regular budget in addition to some of the other things we've typically done, because in order to use the network, you have to have more devices. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1921.61s">Probably</a>  a lot of Chromebooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1922.871s">You'll</a>  see this in the school council reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1927.014s">People</a>  are asking for these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1928.154s">We</a>  need them for testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1929.055s">We</a>  need them for reporting. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1929.995s">There</a>  are a few other devices we will need. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1932.637s">But</a>  the infrastructure is something that we can bond. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1936.059s">And</a>  the infrastructure is something that we can get E-rate money for. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1938.521s">And</a>  that's what we need to really go after right now, because that's money that we wouldn't typically put in an operating budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1946.446s">So</a>  yes, you'll see substantial dollars <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1949.775s">put</a>  to this, plus there's also some staff needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1952.276s">And</a>  we're going to have to try and put that in place and work that around as well.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1957.277s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1957.497s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1958.497s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1958.737s">Just</a>  point of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1959.978s">I</a>  want to make sure that I'm understanding this. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1962.138s">So</a>  the 265.4, that comes out of, that will come out of the capital plan money. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1967.58s">That</a>  does not touch the budget.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1969.921s">That's</a>  the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1970.961s">Christine,</a>  did you want to come up and comment on any of these things? <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1973.201s">Cause</a>  it's financial stuff that she's working closely with.</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1979.37s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1979.77s">Yes,</a>  just also a clarification that we are in the process of reviewing the major procurements that are involved with the E-Rate Priority 2 funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1990.919s">So</a>  it's a substantial process of which we have a federal deadline of May 11th. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1995.443s">So</a>  timing is of great importance in this particular case to make sure that we can maximize their major matching funding piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2004.63s">What</a>  we have on our procurement <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2007.21s">are</a>  the infrastructure switches, the major firewalls, and all of the wireless access points throughout the entire district. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2014.415s">So</a>  we are looking at analyzing the best case scenarios that we can utilize the funds and or maximize what the contribution will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2025.944s">So</a>  some of our bids are coming in, well, they were much better than they had been projected out from a rough calculation. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2036.323s">The</a>  competitive process is definitely very good in terms of getting best pricing. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2042.244s">We</a>  are seeing that based on the quantities that are needed and the level of extensions and infrastructure renovations that we're looking at do cause a couple of overages in certain categories. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2058.607s">So</a>  we are still in the process of having that final analysis done. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2062.768s">We're</a>  getting clarifications back from the vendors as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2066.691s">So</a>  although this is an estimated figure, I would advise that we do not hang our hat on this exact number at this point in time.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2075.675s">When</a>  is the application due?</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2077.896s">May</a>  11th. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2078.317s">May</a>  11th in terms of what we would be identifying as our project in terms of going forward with the funding.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2086.06s">Not</a>  funding approval.</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2087.401s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2088.041s">It</a>  is not a commitment to actual the purchasing and procurement process, but it is saying that <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2096.452s">to</a>  the federal government. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2097.533s">Yes,</a>  we are identifying that this is a priority and we anticipate in fiscal year 18 to provide X, Y, Z amount for this purpose.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2107.501s">So</a>  when would the deadline be after this? <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2110.683s">Like</a>  if we have May 11th, we have, okay, everything goes through. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2114.626s">This</a>  is us just basically saying that we are interested in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2118.669s">This</a>  is what we want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2119.99s">When</a>  is the deadline? <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2120.911s">Because</a>  I just want to make sure we have plenty of time to come back to the board here <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2126.523s">and</a>  take the vote the proper way and make sure that you have enough time to get all the information you need. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2133.408s">But</a>  if I'm not mistaken, we also have to go to the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2136.229s">So</a>  I just don't want to have another fiasco at the last, not, not that we're doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2140.552s">I'm</a>  just saying, I don't want to hear another fiasco.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2142.573s">Well,</a>  let's, let's go over this now. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2144.114s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2144.795s">The</a>  federal government, we put this report in, we put an E-rate, you know, a funding request in every year, the general E-rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2150.819s">This</a>  is tier two. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2152.079s">Tier</a>  one, we generally get 50 to $60,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2153.761s">It's</a>  changed a little bit because of the, <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2156.738s">change</a>  from telecommunications to other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2158.759s">But</a>  generally, that's independent of this, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2161.859s">Tier</a>  2 is a special infrastructure type funding that's designed to give us more robust capability. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2169.201s">We'll</a>  put this in on May 11th, and then we've got to wait for the federal government to actually formally approve it, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2176.663s">But,</a>  you know, if we don't put it in on May 11th, and we don't put this in, we won't be eligible to ask for the money later on. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2184.845s">So</a>  the actual spending <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2186.821s">process</a>  will take place after we have a more, more of a discussion on the details.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2191.905s">Which</a>  is fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2192.486s">And</a>  I totally understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2193.647s">I'm</a>  just trying to figure out how much time though we have from May 11th to the actual time that we have to hold patent until we hear back from the federal government.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2202.434s">We</a>  could go in with an estimate to the council to get the bulk. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2205.516s">We</a>  could do that if we wanted to just secure it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2208.399s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2208.859s">A</a>  little earlier than later. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2210.18s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2210.841s">So</a>  that we could actually have the work and service done. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2215.331s">identified</a>  and ready to go forward.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2217.813s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2218.053s">If</a>  I'm not mistaken, it has to be done also before the budget is, oh no, because there's nothing to do with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2222.796s">I</a>  apologize for that.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2223.697s">You</a>  just want to get an authorization to move forward if you can, because otherwise you lose the opportunity to access it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2230.141s">And</a>  I'm willing to bet, not willing to bet, but I think it's a pretty good bet that this funding will start to disappear with the next federal budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2238.046s">And</a>  I think if we don't act, we won't have this opportunity.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2243.129s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2243.309s">Mustone.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2245.031s">On</a>  page 16 from the back, I think it's the easiest way to see it from the back page 16 from the back.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2252.117s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2253.078s">So</a>  in under traffic to and from different schools, I'd list our schools and devices. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2261.465s">Those</a>  are handheld devices. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2263.226s">So</a>  we have high school, three 11 Andrews, two 39 Brooks, 95 Columbus, 82 McGlynn, six 93 and Roberts 99. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2272.748s">So</a>  what accounts for such a drastic difference in the number of devices at schools?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2277.674s">People</a>  using. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2279.276s">It's</a>  used. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2280.778s">Some</a>  places will be more technologically involved than other places.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2284.362s">Right,</a>  but we've always heard that the Andrews was like our IT school to go to, but this is Sabbath and McGlynn.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2290.43s">McGlynn</a>  is two schools in one, remember?</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2293.049s">So</a>  even if we cut it in half, it still seems like it's substantially more.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2298.153s">Well,</a>  just the way it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2299.234s">I</a>  mean, some places use technology.</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2301.475s">That</a>  was the traffic for a snapshot in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2305.038s">That's</a>  not in totality. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2306.659s">So</a>  it was a day of monitoring. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2309.321s">So</a>  not all of your devices would be on in one particular day. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2312.783s">Not</a>  all of them would be captured for every single school. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2315.966s">So</a>  I don't think that that's a clear delineation that that's the number of devices <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2322.122s">period</a>  in each of those schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2324.382s">It's</a>  what was captured on the activity for the log that they were monitoring the traffic across the Internet connections.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2331.264s">Is</a>  anyone else shocked, though? <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2332.964s">I'm</a>  assuming that we took a snapshot at about the same time at each school, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2338.805s">People</a>  work—they probably worked 7 to 3 in school hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2342.526s">So,</a>  as a parent who's now worried about kids and their device usage at school as well as home, it seems <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2349.83s">So</a>  the percentage-wise goes from 1% to 67%. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2353.912s">That</a>  seems like a red flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2355.973s">And</a>  I'm not an IT person, so I don't know what I'm missing.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2359.395s">Again,</a>  we're talking about a snapshot in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2362.496s">We're</a>  talking about an attempt to find out the capacity of the network to handle traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2367.659s">And</a>  it was done on a few days here and there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2370.12s">It</a>  can't be done every day, because obviously we'd be paying a lot of money for a study that would happen every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2376.688s">And</a>  it just happens this is what's coming through. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2378.589s">So</a>  it gives us an idea of what traffic would look like on maybe a normal day, but maybe it doesn't totally reflect every day.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2385.994s">It</a>  looks really low for the most part, besides the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2388.696s">Something's</a>  missing. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2389.296s">Point</a>  of information, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2391.598s">Pugno.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2411.513s">happen</a>  that day, but it could be a possibility.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2414.215s">But</a>  even the high school 7% looks tremendously low.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2418.079s">Could</a>  we talk to the TechEdge people?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2420.361s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2421.381s">We</a>  can get some comment on that, and they'll follow me.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2423.563s">Because</a>  then on page 8 from the beginning, finding one, that we're paying internet connection at the high school and at the McGlen. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2431.77s">And</a>  I know that I have heard at the Andrews, it's very slow, their connection a lot of days. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2440.128s">So</a>  why isn't a finding for the Andrews as well? <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2442.892s">I</a>  guess it would have been helpful to have a Tech Edge person here. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2445.535s">So</a>  we can bring them in.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2448.84s">That</a>  might be easier. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2449.541s">Bring</a>  them to a school committee meeting versus a committee in the hall.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2452.645s">Yeah,</a>  that'd be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2453.306s">We</a>  can do that.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2454.207s">Motion</a>  to table the report until Tech Edge can come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2460.6s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2462.961s">They</a>  already did without us.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2466.804s">Christine,</a>  do you want a formal vote to submit? <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2469.786s">Maybe</a>  it's a good idea.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2470.866s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2471.286s">So</a>  that we can move forward with the federal deadline.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2475.209s">Is</a>  there a motion to submit a formal request to the federal government? <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2479.191s">So</a>  moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2480.212s">So</a>  moved by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2480.992s">Vanden</a>  Heuvel, seconded by Mr. Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2482.673s">Roll</a>  call. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2493.205s">Yes,</a>  seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2495.005s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2495.845s">Thank</a>  you, Kirsten. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2497.966s">Pre-budget</a>  report, building and grounds.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2500.486s">So,</a>  John, where are you?</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2503.967s">Now</a>  appearing on our stage, John.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2510.809s">You</a>  know, buildings and grounds obviously is a big area for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2517.567s">And,</a>  um, you have a lot of interest in this and I just want to comment before John talks about his specifics. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2523.53s">But,</a>  uh, as I told you in a prior meeting that it's my intent to augment the building repair of mine by 200,000, which would then be distributed among the schools for the various projects that we've all been talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2537.517s">Because</a>  quite frankly, the budget that we have will get used up for, <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2542.61s">general</a>  maintenance and it will be used up for things that, you know, go boom in the night. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2549.212s">So</a>  this would give us some flexibility in doing some of the repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2554.473s">Now</a>  the major piece for the high school, we want to see where the SOI takes us, you know, and there's some other aspects of the high school which John will address, but the SOI is what we submitted to the MSBA and see where that goes because obviously if we get money from them, you know, that's going to be a <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2572.833s">a</a>  lot bigger amount than we would be able to fund ourselves internally. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2576.575s">So</a>  there's a lot going on, but I wanted to have a chance to take a look at some of the things moving through this area. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2581.979s">And</a>  John, you have your copy of your report? <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2583.82s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2584.14s">So</a>  why don't you talk a little bit about what's in your report and I'll be happy to augment it as we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2589.103s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2589.383s">Mr.</a>  Galston, the $200,000 that you're adding to the budget this year, is that going to be annually from this point on?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2598.429s">Well,</a>  I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2599.009s">I</a>  mean, we have to sit down and have that discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2601.01s">I</a>  mean, you know, I think that, <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2602.652s">particular</a>  line item should grow, whether it should grow $200,000, $300,000, or $150,000 is something we can look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2611.999s">It</a>  also depends to some degree on what else we can get funding for. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2616.243s">So</a>  I think the concept is to put a few more dollars in this thing so we can address very specific topics that you have an interest in. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2624.589s">And</a>  we can do it with assurance rather than have to wait to see how many things go bum in the night, which we have to deal with emergency funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2633.115s">Like</a>  we did got a couple of pipes like this year and be here before and so on so forth So it would give us more flexibility, but how much that really depends on you know the projects we identify and where we go with it Mr. McLaughlin good evening mayor Burke superintendent Dawson committee so our district is 1.1 to 1.2 million square feet</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2656.798s">And</a>  we're busy. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2657.619s">We're</a>  very busy at all times. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2659.259s">We</a>  take, uh, we take a lot of work orders, um, a lot of requests. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2664.902s">And,</a>  um, this year we were busy at Medford high school with, uh, a building pipe replacement, which was, um, something that we had hoped to take on with the capital plan, but it just, uh, so happened that we, we had to make the repairs and, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2684.673s">Mayor</a>  Burke has come up with the money to replace the front doors up in Medford High School and door 31, that's the pool door, which is gonna be a big improvement, especially where we have the new studio vestibule and matching everything up. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2699.324s">And</a>  I think we're gonna look into probably some signage too for the main entrance of Medford High School, because I think that sometimes it can be a little confusing for people when they do come to the entrance. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2711.914s">So</a>  I think that the signage is something <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2714.347s">I</a>  think that we can probably work with the vocational school to get something done that would be appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2722.509s">And</a>  everybody's had a chance to read the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2725.389s">If</a>  there's any questions, I'd be happy to answer them.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2729.41s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2729.65s">Mustone.</a> </p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2733.19s">And</a>  I also want to thank Carolyn Montello, a mom from the Brooks, who had reached out to me with some great ideas about how to improve the <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2741.749s">facade</a>  of the high school, and we had the opportunity to meet with John and the mayor at different times, and Mr. Belson. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2748.313s">So</a>  one concern was the pool door that whacks you when you walk in, and the staircase about trying to make that look better. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2757.42s">And</a>  you had mentioned that you would try to get a quote for us?</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2760.362s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2760.762s">Well,</a>  I've been in discussions with Superintendent Belson, and we're trying to come up with a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2767.726s">I</a>  have received a couple of quotes. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2770.52s">So</a>  it'll just be a decision process whether we decide to move forward on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2777.183s">I</a>  will recommend that we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2779.624s">And</a>  then maybe if we do, we can have in-house staff make some of the floor repairs that need to be made. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2787.267s">But</a>  I do wanna get a couple more opinions or a couple more quotes and then see where we can go from there.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2795.158s">Would</a>  it be going over the asbestos?</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2798.401s">No,</a>  I think we've talked about the possibility of doing that, but at this point in time, it may just be better off to abate that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2811.291s">The</a>  first quote that came in, it wasn't as much as I thought it was going to be, truthfully. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2815.955s">So</a>  we'll hash it out and we'll discuss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2820.184s">Hopefully,</a>  if it works out, maybe it'll be a good summer project. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2823.666s">We'll</a>  have to close the entrance down for a few days and work with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2828.269s">And</a>  then, like I said, I think we can have our in-house staff take over after they complete.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2834.994s">The</a>  other was the community school entrance. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2837.896s">When</a>  you're walking in, the blue paint and the rebar was showing in the wall. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2842.059s">It's</a>  been fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2844.06s">And</a>  scaffolding.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2845.141s">It</a>  needs to be painted, but it's been fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2846.802s">But</a>  the scaffolding.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2849.143s">So</a>  scaffolding, can that be done for the light fixtures that are broken in the ceiling?</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2852.745s">The</a>  construction kids are going to do it for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2855.126s">I'm</a>  hoping that they have it set up before the end of school. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2858.768s">But</a>  either way, we'll have it set up for the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2862.89s">Director</a>  Riccio's kids are going to set it up for us, and then we'll go up. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2867.312s">And</a>  I'm hoping that maybe we can do some painting, too, in the ceiling, as well as take down the fans and do a couple of other things, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2876.921s">Should</a>  I, Carolyn, if you're watching, text me what else I'm forgetting.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2880.423s">You</a>  have to video that, John.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2883.045s">Thank</a>  you, John.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2883.665s">Well,</a>  I know that she did have a request about the baseboard up around the gymnastics area. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2891.851s">And</a>  I had it tested. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2893.392s">So</a>  we can remove it ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2895.693s">So</a>  we don't have to worry about any problems with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2901.257s">It's</a>  non-asbestos.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2902.258s">Oh,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2902.678s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2903.018s">We</a>  can work on that, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2906.005s">You</a>  know, it does depend on time. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2909.608s">Now,</a>  I did request a carpenter, but he has been around for a long time, so he does get time off in the summer, and the summer is a short window, so if he could ever, he's been around for 30 years, he does a great job, and if there's ever a time, maybe we can get him some help, that would be good. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2927.559s">That</a>  would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2928.28s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2928.94s">How</a>  many carpenters did you used to have?</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2934.313s">I've</a>  been up to high school for 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2938.196s">There</a>  was probably four or five of them, I think, in 1987 when I came on. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2943.521s">He</a>  does a good job. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2945.182s">He</a>  does a real good job. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2946.403s">Mary</a>  Jo, our secretary, she does a fantastic job. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2950.146s">We're</a>  very lucky. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2952.248s">We</a>  have some really good people.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2957.48s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2957.861s">Just</a>  for clarification, when you're talking about the pool door, you're talking about the door that actually goes up, the entrance to the pool upstairs? <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2964.129s">Yes,</a>  the pool entrance.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2965.23s">No,</a>  no, no, from the outside.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2966.552s">Yeah,</a>  door 31. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2968.198s">That's</a>  the outside door that you go along the ramp and go in. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2971.479s">Oh,</a>  okay.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2972.399s">That's</a>  the door. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2973.059s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2973.279s">That's,</a>  that's the door I want. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2974.72s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2975.16s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2975.46s">And</a>  so, and when you were talking about the floor, were you talking about that carpet that was there for a while?</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2980.301s">We</a>  took it out because it was starting to get a little bit beat up. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2983.882s">So,</a>  um, now we're just talking about removing the tile and then we'll put brand new tile down and it's put some pitches hung up inside there and some paint. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2994.583s">So</a>  that would be the nice finishing touch at this point.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2997.405s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2997.745s">And</a>  the other thing I want to ask is, when you were doing this report, have you had a list, or maybe I want to call it a wish list, but over the years we've all had the opportunity as a committee and singly to go to all the schools and see what needs to be done, what maintenance needs to be done, what needs to be upgraded. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3016.599s">And</a>  I was just curious in knowing, when you wrote the report, did you have the wish list from the schools?</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3024.045s">From</a>  the other schools, I haven't really talked enough to the principals to really find out if they have anything in the wish list. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3034.334s">Now,</a>  I know that we did have a discussion on the bleachers in the various schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3040.499s">And</a>  we did have Frank go out, and I did submit a report that we're in pretty good shape in most of the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3047.642s">but</a>  over the summer, again, it might be a good time to maybe have a company come out and replace some of the nuts and bolts that are making the bleachers come in and out and work and things like that.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3058.627s">Well,</a>  I mean, over the years, it's basically been two just to make sure like, you know, the bathrooms are back up to date because there were a lot of things that were missing when we had walked through the playgrounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3070.293s">I</a>  know that's something that we've all looked at.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3072.874s">Well,</a>  we did. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3073.415s">And</a>  now we've been, that would be probably, you know, a capital, <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3077.034s">capital</a>  wish list or improvement, even some of the paving that needs to be done in some of the parking lots and things like that, it probably would fall more under the capital in the area.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3088.602s">And</a>  just the regular maintenance that we've needed in general, like keeping up with the paint, keeping up with the ceilings, keeping up with, you know, all of it.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3098.909s">Well,</a>  we are, you know, we're working towards it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3101.011s">Like</a>  I said, I've been very lucky to be able to use the Department of Corrections <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3106.056s">And</a>  they've helped us out at the Curtis Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3108.417s">They</a>  were at the Brooks earlier this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3110.577s">I</a>  have some plans, hopefully this summer, to bring them down to the Roberts because they had some requests. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3115.998s">And</a>  then we'll move them, you know, if we can get them, the longer we can get them, obviously the better. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3122.96s">So</a>  we can keep moving around in the buildings, doing common areas, doing classrooms, doing anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3128.632s">And</a>  it's the same thing with the flooring. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3130.153s">Some</a>  of the flooring needs to be looked at again in the different classrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3134.994s">There</a>  may be some tiles popping up. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3137.035s">But</a>  it's just part of our everyday kind of routine that we make our way around town and try to keep it honest, I guess you could say.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3146.737s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3147.618s">And</a>  what about the contractors that we have at the high school for the cleaning?</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3151.039s">Prospect</a>  contractors. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3152.319s">Yeah,</a>  they've been doing a good job. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3153.499s">They've</a>  been very good.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3154.24s">They're</a>  the ones that we still have?</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3155.6s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3156.033s">they</a>  were the ones that we hired this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3157.614s">They</a>  were new. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3158.255s">We</a>  had a empire before. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3160.396s">Now</a>  prospect was awarded the, um, the bid after we did an extensive interview process, the superintendent, um, there was a few of us there and, um, they've been doing a pretty good job there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3173.386s">Uh,</a>  they're resourceful. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3175.468s">They,</a>  they answer the phone, they take care of our needs, you know, when we need them for extra, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3182.635s">issues</a>  and you know that sometimes you have your regular everyday issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3187.057s">Maybe</a>  something was missed or something, something else. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3189.839s">And</a>  they're really good about responding to everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3192.0s">I</a>  haven't had a problem with them at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3193.961s">I</a>  couldn't, couldn't say that, you know, they haven't been good.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3198.604s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3200.224s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3201.868s">John,</a>  first of all, I want to shout out to you and to Alicia Hunt on the new lighting at the Curtis Tough School.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3208.43s">Alicia</a>  does a fabulous job.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3209.99s">That</a>  was requested a few years ago and that took a lot of work to get the grant and get the money and all the work that's been done at that school. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3218.792s">Don't</a>  forget to bring the prisoners back and finish the paint job there.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3222.213s">Well,</a>  we'll get them back in there again and I think we're <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3225.488s">we're</a>  going to try to knock off a couple of more of the floors down there this summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3229.57s">Uh,</a>  we did make a, uh, we did make a change, a personnel change down at that building. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3235.812s">So,</a>  um, I think he, he's done a very good job.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3240.934s">I</a>  know that they were talking about relocating some office space and do you have any updates on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3246.296s">Like</a>  where the kitchen is and the cabinets of, yeah, well it's like,</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3251.464s">We're</a>  gonna have to get back down there again. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3253.465s">You</a>  know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3253.966s">Maybe</a>  we'll talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3255.306s">You</a>  know, it's it's funny.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3256.927s">Maybe</a>  it could be a program like the kitchen area.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3262.09s">Like</a>  I said, we'll see what we can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3263.891s">You</a>  know, you get me that carpenter?</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3265.392s">Well,</a>  that's my point. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3268.273s">Not</a>  only do we need the carpenter, we could also use a vocational if they plan it as a project. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3273.856s">So</a>  maybe we could start now talking to the director of... Yeah, absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3279.698s">And</a>  maybe have that be a work project that throughout the city and have our own children learning right there and interacting with the other students that go to that school at the same time.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3291.244s">I</a>  really, whatever we could do, that'd be, that'd be fantastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3294.626s">I</a>  mean, um, so building has come a long way in the last year or so. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3299.649s">And,</a>  um, well, you know, we'll keep plugging away.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3302.251s">So</a>  I, I support a hundred percent your request for an additional carpenter. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3307.173s">There's</a>  a lot of buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3309.677s">and</a>  a lot of maintenance and our buildings are aging every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3313.579s">So,</a>  and as the superintendent has committed funds to maintaining and upkeeping and grading, I as committee member are gonna support your requests that you have asked for in this budget request. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3327.81s">I</a>  also wanted to ask you, you listed that at the Andrews Middle School, you're in need of a floor scupper. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3334.616s">Do</a>  you know how much that is?</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3338.677s">6,000</a>  or so in that vicinity, maybe even a little less. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3342.62s">We</a>  purchased one this past year for the Roberts, so.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3347.583s">Good</a>  to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3349.324s">Just</a>  because I had no idea, like, a cost value of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3353.347s">So</a>  you need a carpenter and $6,000 in addition to the $200,000 that the superintendent is going to add to the light items.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3362.173s">Sure,</a>  we'll take whatever we need.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3365.915s">Whatever</a>  it is, you'll get a chance to vote on it.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3368.709s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3368.869s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3369.769s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3369.969s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3370.65s">Thank</a>  you, John, for all your work.</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3374.091s">John,</a>  John, is there any chance of, uh, getting the auto body shop on your list of places to be painted? <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3381.454s">The,</a>  the ceiling is really, really tough and I guess they want to replace the floor, but they don't want to do anything with the floor until the ceiling gets done because they want the place to be a showcase, but it hasn't been painted. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3395.099s">The</a>  walls have been painted. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3396.099s">They</a>  look great. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3396.959s">A</a>  lot of work has been done there, but, <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3398.76s">The</a>  ceiling in the auto body shop is just, it's time.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3402.823s">Well,</a>  I can look into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3404.043s">Like</a>  I said, it would probably be, you know, that would probably have to be sprayed. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3411.528s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3411.648s">You</a>  know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3412.889s">So</a>  I can certainly get a price and find out, you know, I know that the DOC wouldn't be something that they would do, you know, spraying and stuff.</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3424.676s">You</a>  just take a look at it when you get a chance. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3427.555s">see</a>  if we can put our heads together and come up with a solution.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3430.476s">We</a>  use a guy to paint around the school sometimes and he's pretty reasonable. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3435.517s">He's</a>  done some work in the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3438.097s">So</a>  I can, I can, um, I can call him up and see if you get a price.</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3442.978s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3443.319s">The</a>  very least. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3444.179s">Good.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3444.639s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3445.239s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3446.679s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3446.859s">Van</a>  der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3447.98s">Um,</a>  I think mayor Burke, this is actually a question for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3451.28s">Earlier</a>  this year we started out by putting together, <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3454.626s">items</a>  that we thought were part of a capital improvement plan, including the edging along at the middle school complex, all of that edging along the roads that were sidewalk, which were a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3470.24s">And</a>  I think also the playgrounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3472.522s">But</a>  I haven't, we're really sort of talking about individual projects again and not the capital improvement plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3479.269s">Where</a>  are we on that?</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3481.038s">We</a>  have pretty much nailed down the city side of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3484.72s">We're</a>  waiting to have another committee of the whole to finalize the school side of everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3489.763s">But</a>  as far as freedom way goes, I'm having the engineering department looking at seeing if we can create it as a public way because then it's applicable for check to 90 funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3499.629s">So</a>  I have a Cassandra could lead us working on that as we speak because if we can get that, then we could get that whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3505.693s">road</a>  done. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3507.174s">So</a>  I'm keeping my fingers crossed.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3509.294s">And</a>  would a project like, I mean, again, we've, we've sort of had ongoing concerns ultimately about the play surfaces and the playgrounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3516.877s">And</a>  I know that much work was done and there were patches and whatever, but you know, it's still out there as a project, which we, we need to take a look at.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3526.46s">So</a>  finishing up fine tuning pretty soon.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3530.402s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3531.262s">Yep.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3532.042s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3533.063s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3534.942s">We</a>  have a citizen. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3538.724s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[McKillop]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3540.745s">David</a>  McKillop, 94 Rockland Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3542.986s">Good</a>  evening everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3544.627s">Um,</a>  I was actually at the, um, city council meeting about the capital improvement in the SOI and we were kind of, there were some things being bantered back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3553.091s">My</a>  question is, uh, in the capital improvement program, is there an opportunity to usurp some of that money? <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3560.228s">for</a>  maintenance for an extended amount of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3575.906s">create</a>  some sort of a bucket of money, if you will, for this.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3580.247s">Well,</a>  the superintendent's fine-tuning the plan for the school side. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3584.229s">And</a>  once we get that, then we'll develop the dollars that are needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3587.95s">And</a>  then we'll try to put together the puzzle of money to pay for it.</p>

    <p>[McKillop]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3591.791s">One</a>  suggestion or one idea might be where you had done a tremendous job collecting taxes on property that did not have taxes collected on. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3600.454s">I</a>  think it was over $2.8, $2.9 million this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3605.075s">That</a>  may not happen every single year, but is there a possibility where we could actually take some of that instead of putting it into the general fund and applying that to the maintenance of the schools? <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3614.803s">Because</a>  to be honest with you, I feel bad for John. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3617.625s">I</a>  think he needs two carpenters. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3619.747s">I</a>  have an 11,000 square foot building and I could never do what he does with one person. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3625.211s">It's</a>  just a suggestion, but there has to be something to take these schools to a different level because I remember I was here <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3632.941s">when</a>  we built the middle schools and we were kind of fighting, you know, we're taking them out of the neighborhoods and putting them into a general area. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3641.009s">It</a>  wasn't about the schools that I was fighting. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3642.83s">It</a>  was about the maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3643.931s">Cause</a>  we were complaining that the older schools were not habitable. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3646.994s">They</a>  make great condos now, but they're not habitable for schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3650.417s">So</a>  here we are now 15, 20 years, however many years it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3654.121s">And</a>  I made the same point, you know, now some of these schools need some dramatic maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3659.002s">So</a>  you can get $10 million in capital improvement, but if you don't have a maintenance plan, you're going to be back in the same boat 10 and 15 years from now. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3667.106s">So</a>  you need to create a plan for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3669.507s">And</a>  that has to be something that has to be discussed and scrutinized and scrutinized, because that money is money that's not going to be wasted, but is certainly going to be spent unwisely 5, 10, 15 years from now. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3680.952s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3681.412s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3684.552s">Is</a>  there a motion to accept the pre-budget report as reported? <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3687.713s">So</a>  moved by Mr. Benner, seconded by Mr. Skerry. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3691.573s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3692.313s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3693.214s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3694.334s">Motion</a>  passes.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3695.554s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3696.654s">Report</a>  on state proposed budget for the fiscal year 18, Mr. Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3700.935s">So</a>  this is a good opportunity for me to wrap a few things together and also talk about some of the things that just came up. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3708.637s">The</a>  Massachusetts House of Representatives <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3711.39s">passed</a>  its initial version of the FY 2018 state budget last Tuesday, April 25th. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3719.952s">The</a>  House version will now go to the State Senate for their deliberations, ways and means, and then the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3727.334s">And</a>  we would expect the Senate version to emerge sometime in late May. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3732.635s">Since</a>  there will be differences between the two legislative bodies, there will be a joint conference committee consisting of three members from each chamber. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3741.033s">And</a>  they'll try to reconcile their differences and then go to the full body in each chamber to get an up or down vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3747.959s">They</a>  can't make changes once it comes out of conference committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3752.363s">Then</a>  the changes, once it comes out from the full legislature, will go to the governor. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3756.747s">The</a>  governor undoubtedly will veto some line items. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3759.53s">The</a>  legislature historically will override most of his vetoes, give or take a few here and there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3766.585s">and</a>  the state budget should be completed sometime by the end of June. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3771.989s">However,</a>  we have to start doing our budgets well in advance of that, so we start to look at what the House and the Senate will do, because typically there are pretty good guidelines as to what will happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3785.3s">But</a>  we don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3787.282s">The</a>  Senate tends to be a little bit more financially generous than the House, although items vary from area to area. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3794.313s">For</a>  the first time, the initial budget from the House exceeds $40 billion. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3801.417s">It's</a>  actually less than what the governor proposed, slightly, but it still exceeds $40 billion to support the various line items and any new programs and services. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3812.664s">But</a>  most of the new money goes to mass health, pensions, and a modest increase in local aid.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3822.35s">Limited.</a> </p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3823.171s">Very</a>  limited. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3824.307s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3824.707s">We'll</a>  go into some of that in a way, but 40% of the budget typically or more right now is mass health. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3833.351s">So</a>  it gives you an idea of, you know, it may be $40 billion, but so much of it is eaten up by certain entitlements that, uh, there isn't a lot of discretionary funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3842.856s">So</a>  the main limitation on the budget is the availability of money, uh, to support the various line items. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3851.239s">any</a>  new programs and services, just like we're talking about right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3854.121s">How</a>  much money is going to be available to do all the things that you think should be done? <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3859.523s">Most</a>  of the new money, as I say, goes for certain items. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3863.986s">During</a>  FY 2016, the state found the budget was initially short $455 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3868.908s">And</a>  this year, revenue, as the end of March, is running $220 million below estimates. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3879.68s">April</a>  receipt should be higher. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3881.44s">April</a>  is usually a very good month. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3882.781s">The</a>  beginning of the month was good. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3884.541s">But</a>  until we get the final figures, we don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3888.142s">But</a>  typically, we should be able to close a good portion of that gap. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3892.363s">But</a>  closing that gap doesn't give us any surplus, doesn't give any excess. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3895.463s">It</a>  just gives us a gap close. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3898.504s">And</a>  there's no guarantee that how much money will come in, actually, in June, in May and June. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3905.165s">Originally,</a>  the projection for this year was a 3.1% <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3909.57s">growth</a>  factor at the state level. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3912.051s">And</a>  through March, it's 1.7%. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3914.392s">Gives</a>  you an idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3916.152s">And</a>  that's nationally, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3917.213s">2%</a>  growth is sort of like, you know, a hallmark. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3921.754s">A</a>  study by the Federal Reserve explained that while Massachusetts unemployment was down, there was a significant drop in wages and hours worked. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3931.457s">And</a>  that means that the overall personal income was lower. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3936.439s">Spending</a>  was higher, most notably in the health sector. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3940.252s">Additionally,</a>  a sales tax on merchandise was affected by increased online buying, for which there is no tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3947.476s">Furthermore,</a>  it's impossible that the income tax rate will drop again because of the automatic trigger built into the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3954.98s">The</a>  drop in the income tax cost the Commonwealth more of a billion dollars a year since that trigger was put in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3964.866s">There</a>  appears to be no appetite for increased taxation <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3969.915s">Although</a>  there may be some proposal out of the Senate, as Senate President Rosenberg seems to put this forward a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3977.139s">Although</a>  tax proposals have to emanate from the House first. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3981.261s">Lastly,</a>  we can expect some cutbacks from Washington on domestic spending, including various education items. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3989.152s">So</a>  the following items are things to think about in the house budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3992.973s">And</a>  again, they haven't printed the whole house budget, so I can't get every nickel and dime figured out a hundred percent, but I've gone behind the numbers as much as I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4000.895s">Chapter</a>  70 is $30 per pupil in the house budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4005.516s">Last</a>  year it was $55 per pupil. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4009.037s">The</a>  governor's proposing $20 per pupil. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4012.608s">That's</a>  approximately $145,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4015.751s">Unrestricted</a>  municipal aid is up statewide by 40 million, but when it's distributed, it isn't that much. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4022.757s">The</a>  special education circuit breaker was level funded in the house budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4027.18s">It</a>  could be short somewhere between 10 and $15 million for full funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4032.325s">And</a>  as more students qualify, there's a greater demand on this account. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4038.708s">We're</a>  projecting less funding in fiscal 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4040.729s">We're</a>  in there in 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4043.771s">We've</a>  already given you some of those numbers in the last financial report. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4047.434s">And</a>  there could be a further reduction in fiscal 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4049.676s">And</a>  that's for extraordinary special ed costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4052.638s">So</a>  you have to pay attention to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4054.979s">Charter</a>  school funding is level funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4057.601s">We</a>  expect the statewide entitlement to be $60 million below need, maybe more, depending on how much expansion. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4064.005s">Depending</a>  on the number of students who opt for charter schools, we could see an increase <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4068.353s">in</a>  our local cost, although I think we've leveled pretty well and we're bringing people back. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4075.716s">But</a>  we also know that Washington is very heavy on pro-choice with Secretary DeVos, and we'll see what comes out of there for the choice issues in support of charter schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4087.06s">Homeless</a>  transportation is level funded, 50% of what we think entitlement would be, if that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4094.88s">No</a>  funding, new funding came back for kindergarten. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4097.081s">We</a>  lost $143,000 last year, and there's nothing in that line item this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4103.524s">Out</a>  of district, non-resident transportation is cut. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4107.646s">Could</a>  lose about $30,000 in that particular line item. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4111.527s">And</a>  there's no new funding for technology that we've seen outside of what I presented this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4116.71s">We</a>  will be able to get some significant federal dollars, as I explained. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4120.771s">The</a>  Department of Public Health funding should be reasonably stable. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4123.872s">That</a>  funds a nurse and some of the work that's done on health prevention. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4128.874s">Early</a>  childhood funding through the grant account is expected to lose 30% of current level as priorities shift from programs to workforce development support. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4139.599s">In</a>  other words, increasing the salaries of people in the nonprofit sector and providing additional training for them because they're well underfunded. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4148.722s">And</a>  it's certainly a worthy priority <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4150.828s">But</a>  they didn't say we'll do both. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4152.508s">They</a>  said we'll take the money from the programs and move it over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4156.31s">So</a>  there's a little bit more there, but it's not clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4160.011s">So</a>  we just got through talking a little bit about maintenance and things of that type. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4165.912s">There's</a>  a finite pot of gold out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4168.673s">And</a>  you just can't say we'll just do everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4172.174s">We'll</a>  try to provide you with options across the board so you can select. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4176.615s">And</a>  hopefully, we'll continue to search out new sources of funding <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4180.113s">like</a>  we have with the vocational school and other things and opiate prevention to augment what we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4185.975s">But</a>  the general distributions coming from the state place a tremendous burden on the locality. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4192.717s">The</a>  cost of health care keeps going up. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4195.478s">We</a>  just don't know, you know, where it's coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4197.398s">We</a>  don't know what Washington's going to do and what's going to happen to that situation yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4202.38s">It</a>  goes back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4204.04s">And</a>  there are a lot of other factors that have to come into play. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4207.441s">So</a>  we also have <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4209.59s">to</a>  carry at least a 2.5% increase in salary negotiations, which isn't outrageous, but it's money. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4219.717s">And</a>  then you also have step increases that people who are starting, the young teachers move up the steps, that's on top of the 2.5. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4226.642s">So</a>  there's a lot of factors. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4229.564s">It</a>  would be easy for me to get up and say, sure, tell me whatever you want me to fix, tell me whatever you want me to do, go add this, add that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4235.969s">It's</a>  not that simple and you know it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4237.907s">You</a>  know, what it is is that we have to lay it all out and decide what's most important to us and move forward with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4244.373s">I</a>  think there's a lot of great things going on in this community and go a lot of great things going on in the school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4248.977s">Should</a>  be very proud of the work you've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4250.818s">Very</a>  proud of the administration and city hall supporting us. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4254.061s">However,</a>  you know, there will be some limitations and we'll have to make some tough choices, forced choices. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4259.766s">So</a>  the budget process is beginning at the state house. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4263.621s">We'll</a>  keep watching the Senate. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4264.922s">We'll</a>  go up and lobby, you know, for other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4267.644s">We'll</a>  talk to people about things. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4269.025s">We'll</a>  look for additional grants, look for additional revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4272.007s">We've</a>  recaptured some revenue through the minute man activity, the revenue coming in through the vocational school, but still it's going to be spread out. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4280.112s">So</a>  just wanted to give you a quick snapshot of the state budget so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4284.295s">We'll</a>  keep you posted and we'll keep talking budget as we go forward and try to set priorities.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4298.189s">OK,</a>  that's the Minuteman bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4299.909s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4300.609s">So</a>  in another year from now, we won't have a bus going to Minuteman. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4306.13s">We're</a>  going to try and get a smaller vehicle, which may cost less. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4310.011s">But</a>  if I lose the reimbursement for non-resident last year, two years ago, it was almost $3 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4315.612s">Then</a>  it went down to half of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4317.232s">And</a>  this year in the House budget, it's $250,000 for that line item.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4320.648s">So</a>  how many students are at Minuteman right now?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4323.329s">This</a>  year, there's about 16 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4325.45s">Next</a>  year, I would expect eight.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4326.89s">Oh,</a>  they could fit in my van. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4328.171s">I'll</a>  take them in my van.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4329.011s">You</a>  could do it.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4329.932s">I'll</a>  get you licensed.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4331.112s">So,</a>  you know, hey, listen, if you can't go one way, we'll must own the other way. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4335.894s">How's</a>  that? <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4336.734s">OK?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4337.955s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4338.415s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4339.195s">You're</a>  welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4339.675s">What</a>  else?</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4339.935s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4340.055s">Van</a>  der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4340.956s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4341.596s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Superintendent, for your report. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4344.077s">You</a>  touched on possible federal impacts, and of course that picture is not clear to us at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4349.88s">However,</a>  today the National School Boards Association did send out an alert because of the concern about the legislation to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act and the impact on Medicaid funding for public school students. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4368.971s">If</a>  passed at this point, it would <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4373.093s">limit</a>  Medicaid funding and it says the impact the ability of students with disabilities and students in poverty to receive critical necessary health services in public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4383.355s">The</a>  legislation will require schools to compete for limited Medicaid funding and result in the institution of arbitrary caps and how much Medicaid reimbursements are made to public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4393.437s">Again</a>  this would be another area where I know that money comes back to the city but it's another place where we would <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4402.005s">find</a>  a loss.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4402.825s">It</a>  impacts the pie.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4404.045s">It</a>  impacts the pie. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4406.626s">They</a>  urge us to call our House of Representatives people. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4411.387s">Of</a>  course, we understand where they already sit in our state. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4417.208s">However,</a>  I did want to bring it to your attention.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4419.008s">No,</a>  it's definitely an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4420.828s">Just</a>  so you know, the Medicaid funding is generated by students who are eligible through disabilities and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4426.969s">The</a>  money comes back. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4428.17s">Short</a>  Collaborative is our <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4430.869s">broker,</a>  if you will, it comes back through it, but it goes into the city treasury. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4434.27s">And</a>  as the mayor points out, it adds to the total pie that's then available for redistribution to the schools, to the city and other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4440.713s">So</a>  it's factored into the overall who gets what kind of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4443.934s">You</a>  know, there's some people that say they wanted to come to them, but <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4446.799s">quite</a>  frankly, it's the same pot of gold we just simply work with. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4450.621s">But</a>  it could be $400,000, $500,000 that we could lose. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4454.102s">And</a>  the state could lose that much more because they're dependent on it as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4459.104s">And</a>  that could drive the cost of health care right through the roof, which will also impact our employees as they have to pay more for health insurance and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4466.587s">And</a>  of course, that <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4467.744s">would</a>  bring them to the bargaining table, because next year, while we're covered for next year, bargaining for the successor contracts will start all over again. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4475.949s">And</a>  as they lose money in terms of the health care costs and things of that type, they're going to be looking for something to make it up in salary. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4483.374s">So</a>  all this stuff has triggers that are going to be thought about, planned. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4489.838s">We've</a>  got to understand what it means. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4492.239s">When</a>  we commence something going forward, we've got to realize it might have ripple effect <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4497.127s">multiple</a>  years down the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4498.327s">It's</a>  not just, you know, any one year. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4499.868s">It's</a>  that year, maybe, but then there's more going on down the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4504.589s">And</a>  as it, as it stands now, we're, you know, we're using a lot of generated revenue to support our operations. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4512.311s">Some</a>  point in time that generated revenue will hit a wall. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4515.851s">We</a>  can only make so much at any given time. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4518.152s">So</a>  there's all kinds of issues, but Washington, you know, is a, is a real black hole. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4523.473s">You</a>  really don't know a lot of the programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4525.254s">Title</a>  two is a, <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4527.528s">150,000</a>  go into salaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4529.969s">That</a>  could disappear, you know, for class size reduction. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4534.49s">Other</a>  programs like that for supplies, materials, bilingual, you know, money could come down. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4541.412s">And</a>  as you can see, our population is significantly growing in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4546.574s">I</a>  think, you know, I think the issue of, and I know it's unpopular, the millionaire's tax is out there someplace, whether that actually goes through in a year from now certainly would be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4556.033s">to</a>  the revenue pie, but then again, if that money gets generated, who will get it? <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4562.477s">The</a>  issue of any money generated through the marijuana bill, sales taxes, other things like that, all up in the air. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4569.26s">There's</a>  a whole group out there that want to cut the sales tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4571.902s">You</a>  don't want to bring it back down again. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4573.763s">So</a>  there's a lot of discussions that are going on right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4578.312s">You</a>  know, we've got to balance it all. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4580.014s">So,</a>  you know, I love it when people come up and say, we need this and need that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4583.637s">And</a>  I, you know, and I really respect that because they're telling, they're advocating for what they want and that you should. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4590.062s">But</a>  then our job becomes how to balance it out, how to, how to do as much as we can and fairly apportionate to the things that, you know, they're important to us.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4601.61s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4602.39s">I</a>  just wanted to touch base on what my colleague was talking about, because I do mass health billing for the school I work at. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4611.694s">And</a>  that's actually for speech therapy, physical therapy, occupational therapy. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4619.678s">That's</a>  refunding for those services that we provide students. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4623.38s">And</a>  instead of them going back to their doctor's office or outpatient visits, we do them in the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4628.542s">And</a>  we have those people in the schools so that they can not <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4631.617s">the</a>  children that specifically need it, but they're in the school, so they help all children. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4636.939s">And</a>  when we don't receive those fundings, we're less likely to have funds to employ those type of people in our school systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4645.861s">And</a>  it does matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4646.942s">So</a>  I don't think people realize it when you're just talking about funding being cut, unless you tell them how it affects our children every day, and the development and growth that people make early in their lives with OT, with speech, <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4660.736s">and</a>  the abundance of how quickly they learn and no longer need those services because they get them well. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4668.3s">And</a>  if you treat well and treat early is how I look at things, and then you don't have to treat later, you know, because you have the skills. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4676.924s">You</a>  have mastered some of those skills, so you no longer need those services. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4681.687s">But</a>  I just wanted it to be relatable. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4684.748s">It</a>  matters to our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4686.029s">It</a>  matters not only in dollars to our city, but it matters to services <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4690.577s">among</a>  our children, and that's what we're here for.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4694.739s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4695.46s">Is</a>  there a motion to accept this report and place it on file? <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4698.981s">So</a>  moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4699.482s">Seconded</a>  by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4700.202s">Kreatz.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4701.043s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4702.243s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4702.443s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4703.364s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4707.326s">Negotiations</a>  and legal matters, none? <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4711.746s">On</a>  the back, we have school committee resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4714.107s">Be</a>  it resolved that the Medford School Committee expresses sincere condolences to the family of Irene Hagee. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4719.248s">Mrs.</a>  Hagee was the mother of Carolyn Hagee, former administrative assistant to the superintendent and secretary to the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4726.11s">And</a>  we have another item in the addendum. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4728.33s">Be</a>  it resolved that the Medford School Committee expresses sincere condolences to the family of Ahmed Azizi. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4733.312s">Mr.</a>  Azizi was a former Medford Public Schools custodian. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4736.112s">If</a>  you could all please rise for a moment of silence. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4754.504s">Motion</a>  to adjourn. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4756.371s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4756.551s">Van</a>  der Kloot.</p>
