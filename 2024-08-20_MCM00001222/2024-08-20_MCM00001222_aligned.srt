00:00:00,071 --> 00:00:02,433
Hi everybody, this is the Medford Historical Commission.

2
00:00:02,533 --> 00:00:05,095
Today is Monday, August 19th.

3
00:00:05,195 --> 00:00:06,116
It's 630.

4
00:00:06,897 --> 00:00:15,524
We have a special meeting tonight to vote to lift a demo delay for the property at 38 Pearl Street.

5
00:00:15,604 --> 00:00:19,288
So before we get started, let me just read our little official

6
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:28,935
Notice here, pursuant to Chapter 20 of the Acts of 2021, this meeting of the City of Medford Historical Commission will be conducted via remote means.

7
00:00:29,435 --> 00:00:34,759
Members of the public who wish to access the meeting may do so by using the Zoom link provided for in the agenda.

8
00:00:35,379 --> 00:00:43,285
No in-person attendance or members of the public will be permitted and public participation in any public hearing during this meeting shall be by remote means only.

9
00:00:46,355 --> 00:00:53,918
So as I mentioned tonight, we are going to look at 38 Pearl Street and the intention is to vote to lift the demo delay.

10
00:00:53,938 --> 00:00:57,240
This was continued from our meeting last week.

11
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,341
We did not have a quorum to vote.

12
00:01:00,261 --> 00:01:03,702
So apologies to Attorney Desmond and Nelson for that and hiccup last week.

13
00:01:04,043 --> 00:01:06,724
We had two members of the commission.

14
00:01:06,764 --> 00:01:09,745
I had three members of the commission out and then one of the members that was here.

15
00:01:10,225 --> 00:01:18,628
had a conflict and had to recuse themselves so I have all the voting members here tonight and the two that are not able to vote are not here so we should be good to go.

16
00:01:20,309 --> 00:01:35,935
So I just wanted to just do a brief recap of kind of where we started and where we got to and I'll kind of turn it over to Doug and Eleni and Peter as the demo delay kind of review board from that and

17
00:01:36,595 --> 00:01:42,338
We can kind of review that and then I'll put it out for discussion in a vote to the rest of the board.

18
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:45,480
So, Doug, Peter, Eleni, I will turn it over to you.

19
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:53,065
All right, Peter, let's put the drawings up so we can look at those.

20
00:01:53,085 --> 00:01:53,865
Oh, good.

21
00:01:53,885 --> 00:01:56,467
Give me a second here.

22
00:01:57,087 --> 00:02:01,209
And I'm sorry, is this a full demo or is this partial?

23
00:02:01,369 --> 00:02:02,210
This is partial.

24
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:03,660
partial.

25
00:02:04,081 --> 00:02:06,042
Can you guys see that screen?

26
00:02:06,062 --> 00:02:06,483
We can.

27
00:02:06,603 --> 00:02:06,883
Yes.

28
00:02:07,023 --> 00:02:07,283
Okay.

29
00:02:12,308 --> 00:02:15,370
Can you walk through the massing changes and some of the things we talked about?

30
00:02:16,491 --> 00:02:17,612
Yeah.

31
00:02:18,473 --> 00:02:24,739
So in the previous iteration, this side mass was kind of,

32
00:02:28,614 --> 00:02:29,935
more or less an extrusion.

33
00:02:31,396 --> 00:02:34,358
There was a slight step back on one side.

34
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:44,364
I don't know where that other facade is, but anyway.

35
00:02:45,285 --> 00:02:56,732
And so there were some comments about trying to break up the math a little bit so that the edition read more like an edition, sort of in a New England style.

36
00:02:57,938 --> 00:03:01,481
and not as much as an extrusion.

37
00:03:02,221 --> 00:03:16,132
And there was some comments that perhaps the addition could look more like an, along with that kind of a, not quite as, not quite as elaborate in its detail.

38
00:03:16,772 --> 00:03:21,496
So it's not to compete with the front, the original mass here in the front.

39
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:24,899
What else?

40
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:35,266
This particular facade, even though it's existing, had a lot of blank surface, so we requested they add some fenestration, and they did.

41
00:03:35,286 --> 00:03:41,010
Sorry, I can't hear what he's saying.

42
00:03:44,912 --> 00:03:48,434
Sorry, I couldn't quite hear you there.

43
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:49,095
Was that you, Doug?

44
00:03:51,964 --> 00:03:56,047
Yeah, somebody was trying to speak and it was really like the internet was kind of struggling.

45
00:03:56,067 --> 00:03:58,708
I'm not sure who that was.

46
00:03:59,249 --> 00:03:59,809
It might've been.

47
00:04:00,389 --> 00:04:01,550
Oh, Doug just dropped off.

48
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:03,151
So let's see if we can get him back.

49
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:05,753
Oh, there.

50
00:04:06,834 --> 00:04:07,094
Anyway.

51
00:04:07,694 --> 00:04:08,214
Okay.

52
00:04:09,275 --> 00:04:14,759
Yeah, so this, the other sides, the front, and then the left side.

53
00:04:15,862 --> 00:04:25,710
I think we had like a one foot setback before on the left side, and now they kind of added this little connector segment here.

54
00:04:26,631 --> 00:04:31,615
And the rear portion of the addition kind of reads like a separate mass.

55
00:04:33,116 --> 00:04:36,999
So we're still keeping the porch on the side here on the corner.

56
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:38,980
I'm just looking at the Google Earth.

57
00:04:41,792 --> 00:04:43,955
image from how it is today.

58
00:04:43,975 --> 00:04:46,918
So this is staying, this is there today.

59
00:04:46,938 --> 00:04:53,846
I'd have to have confirmation of that.

60
00:04:54,607 --> 00:04:58,872
It's been a while since I looked at that, but I believe so.

61
00:04:58,892 --> 00:04:59,934
This part here.

62
00:05:01,212 --> 00:05:06,755
Yeah, so when you're looking at the front of the house, there's this little wrap around porch here.

63
00:05:06,775 --> 00:05:11,958
Yeah, and then the addition's gonna come off the rear, off to the side, okay.

64
00:05:12,238 --> 00:05:13,519
That's my understanding.

65
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:24,546
If any of the development team wants to chime in on that, let us know.

66
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:27,928
I thought all those were good moves.

67
00:05:29,181 --> 00:05:34,364
We're maintaining the integrity of the original home, actually improving it, I think.

68
00:05:35,885 --> 00:05:37,706
And then the addition looks like an addition.

69
00:05:41,648 --> 00:05:42,408
I was pleased with that.

70
00:05:43,789 --> 00:05:44,970
Other commissioner comments?

71
00:05:48,912 --> 00:05:57,096
Yeah, I think the applicant really listened to our comments before, and I'm pretty happy with the changes.

72
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:58,217
I don't really have any other

73
00:05:58,867 --> 00:06:00,427
comments to add.

74
00:06:00,487 --> 00:06:01,687
It just, I think, looks good.

75
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:09,709
And yes, I think maintaining the identity and integrity of the individual building or the original house as a separate entity is important.

76
00:06:09,749 --> 00:06:13,570
I think that was accomplished in this updated design.

77
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:19,031
Great.

78
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:20,131
I concur as well.

79
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:27,052
So I think the subcommittee is pretty much

80
00:06:28,573 --> 00:06:37,581
satisfied at this point, I think, Jen, with the responsiveness and the quality of the resubmission.

81
00:06:37,601 --> 00:06:43,566
So I think unless other commissioners have any comments, like Ed or yourself, I think we're ready to vote.

82
00:06:43,586 --> 00:06:46,348
Ed, do you have any comments?

83
00:06:49,831 --> 00:06:52,193
Not a street I know well, although I live close to it.

84
00:06:52,914 --> 00:06:53,735
So I'm going to open.

85
00:06:54,878 --> 00:06:58,799
I'm not gonna pass anything further.

86
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,800
Okay, I think it looks great.

87
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,001
Thank you to everybody for your hard work on this.

88
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:09,323
Attorney Desmond or Nelson, do you have anything that you'd like to say before we vote?

89
00:07:12,704 --> 00:07:13,885
I'm gonna stop the share here.

90
00:07:15,665 --> 00:07:18,646
No, I'm fine, Janet, thank you so much.

91
00:07:19,267 --> 00:07:21,367
Okay, Attorney Desmond.

92
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:22,288
Thanks for everything.

93
00:07:22,688 --> 00:07:22,928
You good?

94
00:07:24,241 --> 00:07:26,922
I'm good, except for to say thank you for doing this.

95
00:07:27,542 --> 00:07:29,623
Yeah, no problem.

96
00:07:29,703 --> 00:07:30,944
Happy to help.

97
00:07:31,464 --> 00:07:44,229
Okay, so then as it pertains to the matter of 38 Pearl Street to vote to lift the demo delay based on the plans that were presented tonight, I will go around for a roll call vote as I see folks on my screen.

98
00:07:44,849 --> 00:07:45,209
Peter.

99
00:07:45,269 --> 00:07:46,730
Do we need to make a motion?

100
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,110
Oh yes, I'm sorry.

101
00:07:48,971 --> 00:07:51,291
I'll get a formal motion from one of the commissioners.

102
00:07:52,052 --> 00:07:52,552
So moved.

103
00:07:53,631 --> 00:07:54,372
Thank you, Peter.

104
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:55,733
Second.

105
00:07:56,333 --> 00:08:04,699
Okay, so as to the motion to vote to lift the demo delay based on the plans presented tonight, I will go around for a roll call vote.

106
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:05,459
Peter?

107
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:06,360
Yes.

108
00:08:07,261 --> 00:08:07,461
Ed?

109
00:08:09,122 --> 00:08:10,203
Yes to remove delay.

110
00:08:11,223 --> 00:08:11,624
Elainey?

111
00:08:12,204 --> 00:08:12,464
Yes.

112
00:08:13,245 --> 00:08:13,645
And Doug?

113
00:08:14,226 --> 00:08:14,406
Yes.

114
00:08:15,251 --> 00:08:17,332
and I am a yes as well, five, zero.

115
00:08:18,133 --> 00:08:19,113
So thank you so much.

116
00:08:19,393 --> 00:08:28,418
Nelson, if you could just upload the plans with your permit, we will draft your letter and I will get that over to you, Attorney Desmond, and you will be on your way.

117
00:08:28,438 --> 00:08:30,239
Thank you so much.

118
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:30,719
Thank you very much.

119
00:08:30,739 --> 00:08:31,780
Thank you, everyone, and have a great evening.

120
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,000
Thank you.

121
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,361
Thank you so much.

122
00:08:33,421 --> 00:08:36,843
Enjoy the rest of your weekend, or your week, I guess, it's Monday.

123
00:08:39,364 --> 00:08:42,866
Commissioner, is there anything else that we need to talk about since we have

124
00:08:44,133 --> 00:08:52,336
Us here tonight, I sent around the draft letter approving the Riverside Plaza design, which some people were part of that meeting.

125
00:08:52,376 --> 00:08:54,477
Some weren't, but I guess I would like to see.

126
00:08:54,497 --> 00:08:56,498
I don't know if I received any edits so far.

127
00:08:56,658 --> 00:08:57,678
I want to get that letter to the.

128
00:08:58,498 --> 00:08:59,379
Yeah, you know what?

129
00:08:59,419 --> 00:09:02,700
I literally just before I signed on to zoom, I was like, oh, I have to do that for dad.

130
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:07,562
Um, Eleni and Peter, just so, you know, we had a presentation from.

131
00:09:08,342 --> 00:09:12,743
Amanda Centrala last week about some changes to the Riverside Ave Plaza.

132
00:09:13,163 --> 00:09:15,524
We all commented on and Doug has drafted a letter.

133
00:09:15,964 --> 00:09:17,164
So I know you weren't there.

134
00:09:17,384 --> 00:09:25,246
You're welcome to go back and either watch the recording or take a look at the plans are in our Google Drive under section 106 review.

135
00:09:27,407 --> 00:09:30,688
And then we have some comments, and we'll get that letter off to Amanda.

136
00:09:31,729 --> 00:09:36,111
I'll try to read that tonight, Doug, and get you comments and see if we can't just wrap that up.

137
00:09:36,131 --> 00:09:42,233
It wasn't the exact graphics that she presented, but they have the renderings in the PDF that I attached to the draft letter.

138
00:09:42,274 --> 00:09:43,834
So if you want to, you can find them there, too.

139
00:09:44,374 --> 00:09:44,635
OK, great.

140
00:09:44,655 --> 00:09:44,795
Great.

141
00:09:46,483 --> 00:09:46,883
Okay, good.

142
00:09:48,143 --> 00:09:50,504
Yeah, I don't think I have anything else on my end.

143
00:09:51,884 --> 00:09:55,585
Thank you all for doing this in between meeting here.

144
00:09:55,605 --> 00:10:06,388
And we will chat and I will motion to end the meeting at 6.41 p.m.

145
00:10:06,928 --> 00:10:09,688
Move to adjourn as promptly as possible.

146
00:10:09,868 --> 00:10:10,149
Yes.

147
00:10:11,129 --> 00:10:11,829
Second.

148
00:10:12,109 --> 00:10:12,469
Okay.

149
00:10:12,929 --> 00:10:13,809
Motion to adjourn.

150
00:10:13,869 --> 00:10:14,229
Peter?

151
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:14,310
Yes.

152
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:15,090
Ed?

153
00:10:17,581 --> 00:10:18,622
Dinnertime, yes.

154
00:10:19,163 --> 00:10:19,663
Eleni.

155
00:10:20,204 --> 00:10:20,504
Yes.

156
00:10:21,045 --> 00:10:21,465
And Doug.

157
00:10:21,986 --> 00:10:23,768
Yes, 11 minutes, world record, thank you.

158
00:10:23,848 --> 00:10:25,850
All right, thank you all, have a good night.

159
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:26,971
Bye, have a great evening.

160
00:10:27,192 --> 00:10:27,592
Thank you.

161
00:10:27,672 --> 00:10:28,012
Adios.
