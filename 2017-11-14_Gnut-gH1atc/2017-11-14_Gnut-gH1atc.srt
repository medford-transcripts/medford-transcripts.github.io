[SPEAKER_09]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

15

[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to suspend the rules, to take papers under suspension.

16
00:06:50,515 --> 00:06:51,936
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Del Russo, all in favor?

17
00:06:53,476 --> 00:06:58,181
[SPEAKER_09]: paper 17 dash seven five one offered by council a night be resolved.

18
00:06:58,241 --> 00:07:14,318
[SPEAKER_09]: City solicitor in conjunction with the chief of police and building commissioner provide the council with a draft ordinance establishing safety standards, regulating the commercial display and storage of firearms, ammunition and firearm accessories in the city of method.

19
00:07:15,118 --> 00:07:15,699
[SPEAKER_09]: Council night.

20
00:07:16,301 --> 00:07:17,662
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

21
00:07:18,362 --> 00:07:26,088
[SPEAKER_16]: Looking back in the newspaper over the summer, I think if we all recall a police standoff up in Saugus along Route 1.

22
00:07:26,348 --> 00:07:33,132
[SPEAKER_16]: And what happened was the gentleman had made his way into a Dick's Sporting Goods up in Route 1 and got his hands on some firearms, Mr. President.

23
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:34,953
[SPEAKER_16]: And this resulted in a police standoff.

24
00:07:34,973 --> 00:07:36,734
[SPEAKER_16]: They closed down Route 1 for a number of hours.

25
00:07:37,535 --> 00:07:40,577
[SPEAKER_16]: Recently in our community, we were very lucky to open up a Dick's Sporting Goods.

26
00:07:41,187 --> 00:07:44,711
[SPEAKER_16]: And this Dick's Sporting Goods is a great, great facility.

27
00:07:44,771 --> 00:07:50,156
[SPEAKER_16]: However, they do sell some questionable material that I don't personally support, which would be firearms, Mr. President.

28
00:07:50,276 --> 00:07:55,461
[SPEAKER_16]: But this is in no way, shape, or form an attempt to push back on people's Second Amendment rights.

29
00:07:55,521 --> 00:07:59,145
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, what it is is an effort to regulate

30
00:08:00,168 --> 00:08:06,429
[SPEAKER_16]: The safe storage and sale and display of firearms, ammunition, and firearm accessories in the city of Medford.

31
00:08:06,709 --> 00:08:09,030
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, the cat's out of the barn, the horse is out of the barn.

32
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:11,270
[SPEAKER_16]: We have a facility here in the community that's selling firearms.

33
00:08:11,731 --> 00:08:17,492
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's incumbent upon us as a council to take all the steps that are necessary to ensure that we maintain that the community remains safe.

34
00:08:18,172 --> 00:08:27,614
[SPEAKER_16]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I bring this forward as a conversation starter, a spot for us to jump off from a launching pad, if you want to call it that, for us to start this discussion and have this conversation.

35
00:08:28,317 --> 00:08:32,780
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, so with that being said, Mr. President asked my council colleagues to support the measure and move for approvals.

36
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:35,821
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

37
00:08:35,861 --> 00:08:36,442
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

38
00:08:38,203 --> 00:08:39,864
[SPEAKER_09]: Second by Councilor Falco.

39
00:08:39,944 --> 00:08:40,784
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Del Russo.

40
00:08:40,884 --> 00:08:45,167
[SPEAKER_09]: I support this as a conversation, uh, started Mr. Chairman.

41
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:48,168
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion.

42
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:49,349
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

43
00:08:49,649 --> 00:08:49,809
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

44
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:50,830
[SPEAKER_09]: Opposed?

45
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,151
[SPEAKER_09]: The ayes have it.

46
00:08:52,831 --> 00:08:54,112
[SPEAKER_09]: The motion is adopted.

47
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:58,201
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to take papers in the hands of the city clerk.

48
00:09:00,462 --> 00:09:02,123
[SPEAKER_09]: Second motion.

49
00:09:02,343 --> 00:09:05,325
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have any other papers?

50
00:09:07,407 --> 00:09:07,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

51
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:10,329
[SPEAKER_09]: So papers in the hands of the city clerk.

52
00:09:11,729 --> 00:09:12,550
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there's three more.

53
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:14,311
[SPEAKER_13]: You've got 17, seven 52 under suspension.

54
00:09:21,496 --> 00:09:28,018
[SPEAKER_09]: Under suspension 17-752, administration refund taxpayers in the city council, November 14th, 2017.

55
00:09:28,598 --> 00:09:35,880
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll move after this.

56
00:09:39,061 --> 00:09:39,601
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

57
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,236
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

58
00:09:44,516 --> 00:09:57,183
[SPEAKER_16]: This paper here is paper 17752, which reads, be it resolved the city administration refund taxpayers all convenience fees incurred during the current fiscal year as a result of the online payment of tax bills issued by the city.

59
00:09:57,704 --> 00:10:03,327
[SPEAKER_16]: And be it further resolved that the city administration take the necessary steps to eliminate or assume such fees going forward.

60
00:10:04,108 --> 00:10:11,197
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, I've run into several situations, gotten several phone calls, bumped into people that have attempted to pay their property tax bills online.

61
00:10:11,738 --> 00:10:16,604
[SPEAKER_16]: And when they go in there to pay their property tax bill, they are assessed a convenience fee.

62
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,108
[SPEAKER_16]: The last one that I heard was upwards of close to $50, Mr. President.

63
00:10:20,849 --> 00:10:22,410
[SPEAKER_16]: And that doesn't sound too convenient to me.

64
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:23,711
[SPEAKER_16]: We're sitting here in the community.

65
00:10:23,731 --> 00:10:25,092
[SPEAKER_16]: We're asking robocalls to go out.

66
00:10:25,112 --> 00:10:26,714
[SPEAKER_16]: We're asking things to get posted on the website.

67
00:10:26,734 --> 00:10:29,636
[SPEAKER_16]: We're asking people to utilize technology more and more.

68
00:10:29,956 --> 00:10:31,337
[SPEAKER_16]: We shouldn't be charging them to do it.

69
00:10:31,357 --> 00:10:33,839
[SPEAKER_16]: We should be encouraging it, not discouraging it, Mr. President.

70
00:10:33,859 --> 00:10:39,843
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm asking that the administration look into this and to take the appropriate steps to either waive the fee, assume the fee, or eliminate the fee.

71
00:10:42,105 --> 00:10:42,866
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Chairman.

72
00:10:43,486 --> 00:10:44,327
[SPEAKER_09]: Counsel Del Rosso.

73
00:10:47,196 --> 00:10:58,419
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a little R after my name, so I'm the last person that wants to see people taxed, especially when they get taxed that come up from behind them.

74
00:10:59,019 --> 00:11:15,884
[SPEAKER_14]: So this could be construed at that, but I would want to hear an explanation about this from either the treasurer or Alicia Nunley on what our expenses are and how this is something that can, if not,

75
00:11:16,317 --> 00:11:20,040
[SPEAKER_14]: I wouldn't want to see people pay $50 every just to pay a bill.

76
00:11:20,861 --> 00:11:43,578
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, but I certainly, uh, uh, know that at some point, uh, to provide that, uh, so I support this, but I'd like it, uh, uh, to, uh, amend it that, uh, we get an explanation in person from, uh, the appropriate person from the, uh, city administration regarding these financial matters.

77
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:45,039
[SPEAKER_14]: If that's,

78
00:11:46,603 --> 00:11:49,326
[SPEAKER_14]: amenable to the presenter of the resolution.

79
00:11:51,467 --> 00:11:52,828
[SPEAKER_14]: In the spirit thereof.

80
00:11:53,109 --> 00:11:54,850
[SPEAKER_16]: I certainly have no problem with that, Mr. President.

81
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:58,913
[SPEAKER_16]: If we're going to take a vote, I want it to be an informed vote, and I want everybody behind the rail to be comfortable with it.

82
00:11:59,894 --> 00:12:09,742
[SPEAKER_16]: With that being said, I'd be happy to even withhold the request until we have the presentation from the treasurer or the financial director, whatever the council feels comfortable with.

83
00:12:09,802 --> 00:12:13,726
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, I just think this is an opportunity for us to get... They can be simultaneous.

84
00:12:16,044 --> 00:12:19,145
[SPEAKER_14]: most things move.

85
00:12:19,165 --> 00:12:20,405
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to refer to subcommittee?

86
00:12:22,285 --> 00:12:24,086
[SPEAKER_16]: We can do that too.

87
00:12:24,146 --> 00:12:24,986
[SPEAKER_09]: Audit and finance.

88
00:12:25,086 --> 00:12:25,346
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that?

89
00:12:27,206 --> 00:12:28,186
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that's moving along.

90
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,207
[SPEAKER_16]: That's fine.

91
00:12:30,307 --> 00:12:34,468
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, my motion is to have it passed, but, um, you know, go to the administration.

92
00:12:34,508 --> 00:12:41,469
[SPEAKER_16]: But if the council has questions, then I have no problem, um, going along with whatever it is that it will take to make sure that this comes to fruition.

93
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:46,884
[SPEAKER_09]: So the motion on the floor is by Councilor Knight to have this submitted to the city administration.

94
00:12:47,264 --> 00:12:48,044
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

95
00:12:49,105 --> 00:12:49,505
[SPEAKER_09]: Opposed?

96
00:12:49,525 --> 00:12:52,106
[SPEAKER_16]: Did you amend it, Councilor?

97
00:12:52,126 --> 00:12:52,746
[SPEAKER_14]: I amended it, yes.

98
00:12:52,826 --> 00:12:57,288
[SPEAKER_14]: Just to ask that we have an in-person explanation of why this is going on.

99
00:12:58,849 --> 00:13:00,349
[SPEAKER_09]: Before we send it to the administration?

100
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:01,970
[SPEAKER_14]: Simultaneously.

101
00:13:04,831 --> 00:13:05,651
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

102
00:13:05,811 --> 00:13:06,092
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

103
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:06,932
[SPEAKER_09]: Opposed?

104
00:13:07,552 --> 00:13:09,353
[SPEAKER_09]: The ayes have it, the motion is adopted.

105
00:13:10,365 --> 00:13:11,706
[SPEAKER_14]: efficiency, Mr. President.

106
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:17,372
[SPEAKER_09]: Papers in the hands of the clerk offered by Councilor Moxby resolved that the sidewalk in front of one 10, one 12,

107
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,420
[SPEAKER_09]: Warren Street be replaced in the interest of public safety?

108
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:22,241
[SPEAKER_09]: Move approval.

109
00:13:22,521 --> 00:13:23,341
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion for approval.

110
00:13:23,661 --> 00:13:24,381
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

111
00:13:25,081 --> 00:13:25,521
[SPEAKER_09]: Opposed?

112
00:13:25,561 --> 00:13:26,161
[SPEAKER_09]: The ayes have it.

113
00:13:26,281 --> 00:13:27,441
[SPEAKER_09]: The motion is adopted.

114
00:13:27,942 --> 00:13:39,143
[SPEAKER_09]: Offered by Councilor Marks, we resolve that the electronic speed sign be placed after Winthrop Circle heading toward West Meffitt Square on High Street in the interest of public safety.

115
00:13:39,824 --> 00:13:41,164
[SPEAKER_14]: Move approval, Mr. President.

116
00:13:41,524 --> 00:13:47,985
[SPEAKER_14]: If I may, Mr. President, as you're well aware, and I'm sure has been reported to you in why you put this on there,

117
00:13:48,465 --> 00:13:56,752
[SPEAKER_14]: is that we have certainly a lot of hasty driving there that has resulted in a number of bad situations, Mr. President.

118
00:13:57,293 --> 00:14:00,095
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that would be a good place for that monitoring.

119
00:14:00,595 --> 00:14:08,082
[SPEAKER_14]: It serves to quell and remind people of their own behaviors, especially since there's been a citywide adjustment in the speed limit.

120
00:14:08,755 --> 00:14:09,475
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor.

121
00:14:09,535 --> 00:14:11,096
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion, all those in favor?

122
00:14:11,316 --> 00:14:11,456
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

123
00:14:11,757 --> 00:14:12,177
[SPEAKER_09]: Opposed?

124
00:14:12,857 --> 00:14:13,498
[SPEAKER_09]: The ayes have it.

125
00:14:13,558 --> 00:14:14,738
[SPEAKER_09]: The motion is adopted.

126
00:14:15,419 --> 00:14:25,124
[SPEAKER_09]: Offered by Councilor Marks, be resolved that the street pole number 4354 at 41 Mangles be replaced in the interest of public safety.

127
00:14:25,344 --> 00:14:25,824
[SPEAKER_09]: Move the pole.

128
00:14:26,344 --> 00:14:27,145
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

129
00:14:27,165 --> 00:14:27,225
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

130
00:14:28,145 --> 00:14:28,586
[SPEAKER_09]: Opposed?

131
00:14:29,426 --> 00:14:30,066
[SPEAKER_09]: The ayes have it.

134
00:14:35,598 --> 00:14:36,319
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

135
00:14:36,619 --> 00:14:36,719
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

136
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:37,400
[SPEAKER_09]: Opposed?

137
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,041
[SPEAKER_09]: The ayes have it.

138
00:14:38,901 --> 00:14:50,133
[SPEAKER_09]: Motions, orders, and resolutions 17-750 offered by vice president Mox, be resolved that the construction work on Harvard street from main street to Benton road be discussed.

139
00:15:14,957 --> 00:15:15,978
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

140
00:15:16,398 --> 00:15:28,542
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, we all received, uh, uh, several emails regarding the, uh, national grid, uh, is determined that a gas main on Harvard street for main street to Benton road will be replaced.

141
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:39,286
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, starting Monday, November 13th, uh, which was yesterday lasting four weeks, taking a place Monday through Friday from 7.00 PM to 5.00 AM.

142
00:15:40,006 --> 00:15:41,487
[SPEAKER_09]: That was the original request.

143
00:15:42,142 --> 00:15:50,284
[SPEAKER_09]: uh, since then, uh, there's been some, uh, emails going back and forth, uh, that the work will now take place during the day.

144
00:15:51,185 --> 00:15:57,326
[SPEAKER_09]: And, um, I have yet to get confirmation from chief Sacco who needs to make that decision.

145
00:15:57,907 --> 00:16:10,090
[SPEAKER_09]: But, um, the concerns I've heard from residents, and I know many of my colleagues have, uh, was really the lack of notification of residents in the area and the lack of input from any residents.

146
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:17,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Some residents found out through finding a flyer on the street that this work was going to take place.

147
00:16:18,427 --> 00:16:36,997
[SPEAKER_09]: And many homes in the area that directly abut this and whose bedroom windows are located within 20 feet from potential construction at night naturally would have some grave concerns about sleep disruption during a four week span.

148
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:39,598
[SPEAKER_09]: I know there's a number of residents

149
00:16:40,131 --> 00:16:43,413
[SPEAKER_09]: here that would like to speak on the issue, Mr. President.

150
00:16:44,114 --> 00:17:01,745
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, I would ask that this project be duly notified through Reverse 911 in the city, Mr. President, alerting residents when this work will take place, how long the work will take, and when it will be done.

151
00:17:02,525 --> 00:17:08,449
[SPEAKER_09]: If it's going to be during the day or the evening is extremely important, Mr. President, that residents are aware of this.

152
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:14,040
[SPEAKER_09]: So at this time I'd open the floor if anyone from the direct abuttance would like to speak.

153
00:17:17,881 --> 00:17:18,841
[SPEAKER_17]: Good evening.

154
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:19,741
[SPEAKER_17]: Good evening.

155
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:20,261
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

156
00:17:20,461 --> 00:17:21,901
[SPEAKER_24]: My name is Angela Ferrari.

157
00:17:22,061 --> 00:17:24,702
[SPEAKER_24]: I live at two 15 Harvard street and my unit is 19.

158
00:17:24,862 --> 00:17:34,823
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm directly on Harvard street and most certainly the entire area right up outside my door and bedroom will be affected by this.

159
00:17:35,624 --> 00:17:37,724
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, as you mentioned, we learned of this.

160
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:44,791
[SPEAKER_24]: by a flyer, this flyer being taped to my outside door on last Friday afternoon.

161
00:17:45,091 --> 00:17:47,532
[SPEAKER_24]: So that was literally four days, five, four days ago.

162
00:17:48,312 --> 00:17:50,092
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, I knew nothing about this until then.

163
00:17:50,572 --> 00:18:00,454
[SPEAKER_24]: And clearly I don't think any of the other, uh, condo owners at the Lincoln Kennedy school, um, complex learned about it either until we got these notices.

164
00:18:01,294 --> 00:18:04,195
[SPEAKER_24]: This opens up obviously a whole plethora of issues.

165
00:18:04,675 --> 00:18:06,495
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, not only the,

166
00:18:07,251 --> 00:18:12,574
[SPEAKER_24]: original idea of working overnight, which still has yet to be resolved.

167
00:18:13,094 --> 00:18:18,598
[SPEAKER_24]: So we as residents don't know if we're going to be disrupted overnight or in the day.

168
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:28,623
[SPEAKER_24]: But clearly we all object to the overnight work because that means none of us will get any sleep for four or five weeks, whatever this work is slated to be done by.

169
00:18:30,796 --> 00:18:36,713
[SPEAKER_24]: But even if it does go in the daytime, and I understand that they need to upgrade this work.

170
00:18:36,753 --> 00:18:38,137
[SPEAKER_24]: I understand that it needs to be done.

171
00:18:38,632 --> 00:18:49,016
[SPEAKER_24]: What they didn't do is get the residents input as to how that's going to affect us by way of the fact that we are a private association.

172
00:18:49,056 --> 00:18:51,677
[SPEAKER_24]: We are a private property.

173
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:59,640
[SPEAKER_24]: So what happens is a lot of times we get individuals cutting through our property to turn around and go the alternate way.

174
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:05,602
[SPEAKER_24]: It didn't take into effect that the workers will be there extremely early in the morning.

175
00:19:06,161 --> 00:19:15,308
[SPEAKER_24]: to with big trucks digging or needing to park or causing dust up or issues for people that might have health problems.

176
00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:21,413
[SPEAKER_24]: None of that was discussed or even brought to the property owners and gotten input by.

177
00:19:21,453 --> 00:19:24,235
[SPEAKER_24]: There were a lot of families in these units.

178
00:19:25,216 --> 00:19:32,562
[SPEAKER_24]: So clearly both people who work and people who have families are going to be disrupted not only with needing to reroute

179
00:19:33,786 --> 00:19:36,767
[SPEAKER_24]: going in and out of the homes or our parking spaces.

180
00:19:38,908 --> 00:19:42,429
[SPEAKER_24]: And in addition to that, it's over the holidays.

181
00:19:43,149 --> 00:19:45,829
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, they've chosen a very difficult time of year.

182
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:54,092
[SPEAKER_24]: It's holidays, it's, you know, now we potentially could be faced with weather issues that could delay the construction from being finished.

183
00:19:54,492 --> 00:20:01,034
[SPEAKER_24]: So now we're looking potentially going into like, you know, mid to late December, if that's the case, you know, if we do have some weather issues.

184
00:20:03,427 --> 00:20:20,021
[SPEAKER_24]: Beyond that, I think there's a part of this notice that says, temporary or permanent restoration of disturbed areas will be in accordance with the town ordinance.

185
00:20:21,002 --> 00:20:31,071
[SPEAKER_24]: So that doesn't give us a lot of faith that the street being ripped up is going to be returned to the current state that it's in.

186
00:20:32,984 --> 00:20:44,911
[SPEAKER_24]: Myself, as a resident, had a problem with a manhole cover that was constantly banging, and I raised the issue and complained about it for the last year and a half, almost two years.

187
00:20:45,431 --> 00:20:55,357
[SPEAKER_24]: And less than a month or two ago, I finally got that manhole cover fixed, and I finally was able to start getting a good night's sleep with it banging constantly.

188
00:20:55,917 --> 00:20:59,479
[SPEAKER_24]: What this is now saying is it's going to rip up the entire street over again.

189
00:21:00,114 --> 00:21:08,966
[SPEAKER_24]: And when is, you know, then we're dealing with when are these original, the original state of the road going to be back to normal, somewhat normal.

190
00:21:09,587 --> 00:21:14,914
[SPEAKER_24]: In addition, recently over the summer, the intersection of Main Street and Harvard

191
00:21:16,037 --> 00:21:24,223
[SPEAKER_24]: that had had terrible bumps and divots in the road right by a business on the corner there, finally got repaired.

192
00:21:24,643 --> 00:21:26,405
[SPEAKER_24]: And now that's going to be all ripped up.

193
00:21:26,525 --> 00:21:29,287
[SPEAKER_24]: So I guess there's a number of concerns.

194
00:21:29,327 --> 00:21:32,570
[SPEAKER_24]: The disruption, the noise, the lack of notice.

195
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:36,933
[SPEAKER_24]: We're not confirmed when they're going to do the work, whether it's day or night.

196
00:21:38,834 --> 00:21:47,159
[SPEAKER_24]: potential delays in case there's weather, and then of course what the road status is gonna be back to normal if and when it's gonna finally be back after they rip it all up.

197
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:56,224
[SPEAKER_24]: And then we all have to make individual appointments for National Grid to connect our service again.

198
00:21:56,664 --> 00:22:01,447
[SPEAKER_24]: So there's like a number of steps that is going to take place according to their notice.

199
00:22:01,747 --> 00:22:06,950
[SPEAKER_24]: And I don't know if you've received a copy of the notice, which if you haven't, I'd be happy to give you mine or make a copy.

200
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:07,170
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

201
00:22:10,738 --> 00:22:11,018
[SPEAKER_24]: Great.

202
00:22:11,138 --> 00:22:11,518
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

203
00:22:14,179 --> 00:22:17,400
[SPEAKER_24]: I think it would be important for you to have that so that you can refer to it.

204
00:22:17,841 --> 00:22:29,465
[SPEAKER_24]: But you know, I for one understand and I'm happy that they're doing an upgrade, but I think that it just completely could have been, been handled more appropriately and gotten input from the residents.

205
00:22:30,086 --> 00:22:31,806
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you very much for my hearing.

206
00:22:32,447 --> 00:22:33,227
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

207
00:22:33,387 --> 00:22:34,007
[SPEAKER_24]: Any questions?

208
00:22:34,067 --> 00:22:34,207
[SPEAKER_24]: No.

209
00:22:34,387 --> 00:22:34,467
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

210
00:22:34,487 --> 00:22:34,668
[SPEAKER_24]: Thanks.

211
00:22:34,948 --> 00:22:35,548
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

212
00:22:38,643 --> 00:22:39,083
[SPEAKER_17]: Good evening.

213
00:22:39,103 --> 00:22:40,725
[SPEAKER_17]: Your name and address for the record.

214
00:22:41,045 --> 00:22:41,265
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello.

215
00:22:41,285 --> 00:22:44,067
[SPEAKER_10]: My name is Christopher Donovan, uh, full of rain road, Bedford mass.

216
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:45,468
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, just one question.

217
00:22:45,488 --> 00:22:53,214
[SPEAKER_10]: Are we getting a new sidewalk up at, at winter path through this mitigation money through national grid to go back to the prior incident?

218
00:22:53,234 --> 00:22:54,635
[SPEAKER_17]: We did discuss that.

219
00:22:54,715 --> 00:23:00,780
[SPEAKER_17]: That's part of the 200 feet that we were told that Winthrop street will now have sidewalk throughout the,

220
00:23:01,522 --> 00:23:03,083
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's national grid is going to take care of that.

221
00:23:03,323 --> 00:23:04,064
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not a national grid.

222
00:23:04,084 --> 00:23:05,905
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe it was ever source.

223
00:23:06,326 --> 00:23:07,506
[SPEAKER_17]: That was already set.

224
00:23:07,606 --> 00:23:08,687
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that something?

225
00:23:09,648 --> 00:23:12,570
[SPEAKER_17]: And we'll be, that'll be part of next week's meeting too, I believe.

226
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:14,471
[SPEAKER_17]: So we can see this part of the MOU.

227
00:23:14,511 --> 00:23:15,572
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe it was in the MOU.

228
00:23:15,832 --> 00:23:15,993
[SPEAKER_17]: Good.

229
00:23:16,113 --> 00:23:16,493
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you all.

230
00:23:16,513 --> 00:23:17,213
[SPEAKER_17]: Congratulations.

231
00:23:17,674 --> 00:23:17,974
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

232
00:23:20,196 --> 00:23:20,576
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyone else?

233
00:23:23,404 --> 00:23:23,684
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.

234
00:23:24,225 --> 00:23:29,149
[SPEAKER_05]: I was kind of waiting to be the last one speaking because I'm the newest resident of Medford.

235
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:32,833
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe not the newest, but we moved in at the end of July.

236
00:23:32,853 --> 00:23:33,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations.

237
00:23:34,374 --> 00:23:36,296
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe an address for the record.

238
00:23:36,316 --> 00:23:37,497
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm Rod Marden.

239
00:23:37,517 --> 00:23:41,321
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm at 215 Harvard street, unit 17.

240
00:23:42,482 --> 00:23:46,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, the honored neighbor of Angela who gave, uh,

241
00:23:47,262 --> 00:23:50,424
[SPEAKER_05]: thorough, comprehensive presentation of the problems.

242
00:23:51,864 --> 00:24:08,793
[SPEAKER_05]: The only thing that I would like to add to that is standing here, I'm very fortunate to be standing here today because when I moved in, for about five weeks in a row, I was not able to sleep because of that manhole cover.

243
00:24:10,114 --> 00:24:11,436
[SPEAKER_05]: and my health deteriorated.

244
00:24:12,397 --> 00:24:14,781
[SPEAKER_05]: My arrhythmia got much worse.

245
00:24:15,543 --> 00:24:19,349
[SPEAKER_05]: I had to get an emergency appointment with Dr. Felton's office.

246
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:40,058
[SPEAKER_05]: My concern when I saw this flyer and it was shoved into my door, I had a few questions, ones that were addressed by Angela, and also how much coordination was there between National Grid and the city of Medford?

247
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:46,220
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure if there was coordination with Chief Sacco, his department, regarding this.

248
00:24:47,661 --> 00:24:50,082
[SPEAKER_05]: Many unanswered questions as to what's going to happen.

249
00:24:51,900 --> 00:25:04,666
[SPEAKER_05]: I was very glad to see that things were changed to the daytime, but I'm not sure whether the change happened because of some pressure from emails or whether there was any sort of effort and coordination with the city.

250
00:25:05,366 --> 00:25:06,927
[SPEAKER_05]: We have no information about that.

251
00:25:07,847 --> 00:25:12,610
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think before work begins, there should be coordination with the city about this.

252
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:17,972
[SPEAKER_05]: One other point, this is a street that's used by school buses.

253
00:25:20,509 --> 00:25:23,911
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a concern of what's going to happen with the rerouting of those school buses.

254
00:25:24,792 --> 00:25:31,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, if the work was done over the summertime, there would probably, probably be a lot less disruption to the local public schools here.

255
00:25:31,717 --> 00:25:38,101
[SPEAKER_05]: There's something that should be considered unless there's an emergency situation with the gas leak that they have to explore.

256
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:46,947
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, the fire gave some hint that they have to drill some holes or find out where the, uh, where the pipe is.

257
00:25:47,747 --> 00:25:49,669
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm wondering whether they're doing anything about,

258
00:25:50,902 --> 00:25:53,224
[SPEAKER_05]: whether there's a report of a gas leak or not.

259
00:25:54,264 --> 00:25:59,748
[SPEAKER_05]: There's so many questions that have been left unanswered that the residents don't have the answers to.

260
00:26:00,769 --> 00:26:17,840
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that we need to take a look as Medford residents and as our elected representatives to make sure that this work proceeds in the healthiest and best way possible for the residents and for the city.

261
00:26:18,361 --> 00:26:18,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

262
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:32,495
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, for one, I know that this council has worked very hard with making sure that our, uh, our natural grid never source and other utilities do what they need to do.

263
00:26:32,535 --> 00:26:33,555
[SPEAKER_17]: So I find this disheartening.

264
00:26:34,036 --> 00:26:36,837
[SPEAKER_17]: This will be the first time I'll see that, that announcement.

265
00:26:36,857 --> 00:26:40,738
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think this is something that we'll, we'll get on as soon as we can.

266
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:44,900
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you for coming out tonight and, uh, and sharing your opinions.

267
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:45,260
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

268
00:26:46,061 --> 00:26:46,941
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, we have a motion.

269
00:26:48,541 --> 00:26:49,721
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you have any other, anyone else?

270
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:50,101
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry.

271
00:26:50,162 --> 00:27:00,885
[SPEAKER_17]: How's it going?

272
00:27:01,185 --> 00:27:03,646
[SPEAKER_08]: Rick Giganti, Hobbit street, one 39.

273
00:27:05,086 --> 00:27:06,887
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, there's, there's a ton of things for us.

274
00:27:06,927 --> 00:27:09,688
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank God for the local coffee shop.

275
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:11,368
[SPEAKER_08]: Otherwise I wouldn't have even known about this.

276
00:27:11,968 --> 00:27:12,629
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Tony.

277
00:27:13,489 --> 00:27:13,589
[SPEAKER_08]: Um,

278
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:23,264
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm on the other side of the world on this one because I'm on the other side of main street, but that's going to impact me tremendously, whether it's night or day.

279
00:27:24,165 --> 00:27:34,912
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, if you don't know Harvard street, and I'm sure you guys all know, uh, me trying to get out of my driveway at a normal day is a task, let alone trying to do something like this.

280
00:27:35,953 --> 00:27:43,458
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, if it's at nighttime, I have an issue because I have rental property and I, and unfortunately I've been trying,

281
00:27:44,008 --> 00:27:46,110
[SPEAKER_08]: very desperately to try to get parking permits.

282
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:53,076
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't get a parking permit because Harvard street doesn't have parking permits, but where I'm located, they're saying I can park on the street.

283
00:27:53,136 --> 00:27:56,239
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, no, I can't park on the street, not in front of my house.

284
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:59,222
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't have a sign that says no parking both sides.

285
00:27:59,882 --> 00:28:05,167
[SPEAKER_08]: So what we ended up doing with my tenants is they're parking up in front of two 15 on the opposite side.

286
00:28:05,748 --> 00:28:07,029
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, if they're going to rip up the road,

287
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:08,550
[SPEAKER_08]: How are we going to park?

288
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:09,310
[SPEAKER_08]: Where are we going to park?

289
00:28:09,631 --> 00:28:14,712
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I get a parking permit for these tenants of mine, which are two, two females that work.

290
00:28:15,152 --> 00:28:21,454
[SPEAKER_08]: One works at, um, Leahy clinic on, on, uh, she's a nurse and she does 12 hour shifts.

291
00:28:21,494 --> 00:28:24,355
[SPEAKER_08]: So she's getting in at seven and leave it at seven or six.

292
00:28:24,895 --> 00:28:26,235
[SPEAKER_08]: And sometimes she does overtime.

293
00:28:26,275 --> 00:28:28,756
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I have another one that works at Raytheon who does overtime.

294
00:28:29,236 --> 00:28:30,757
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to have an issue with parking.

295
00:28:32,121 --> 00:28:35,184
[SPEAKER_08]: Great things were mentioned here tonight.

296
00:28:35,924 --> 00:28:40,948
[SPEAKER_08]: Weather's going to be coming up, four weeks, daytime, nighttime, school buses.

297
00:28:42,069 --> 00:28:46,372
[SPEAKER_08]: We see it all, never mind just even the fire apparatuses.

298
00:28:47,353 --> 00:28:49,274
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a major state road.

299
00:28:49,855 --> 00:28:53,678
[SPEAKER_08]: I was told when I tried to get a sign for just stopping

300
00:28:55,539 --> 00:29:06,524
[SPEAKER_08]: 200 feet or 100 feet from the red line, from the red light in the four corners, so that I could get out of my driveway on a red light, figuring maybe they could stop here on red.

301
00:29:07,244 --> 00:29:12,307
[SPEAKER_08]: That was against my law and all the laws and rules because it's a state road.

302
00:29:12,987 --> 00:29:16,669
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this going to be a state-funded project?

303
00:29:17,069 --> 00:29:20,170
[SPEAKER_08]: Are we gonna get anything, be in Harvard Street, be in the state road?

304
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:21,331
[SPEAKER_08]: Has that come up?

305
00:29:22,251 --> 00:29:27,177
[SPEAKER_08]: because that was an issue when I went up against a traffic commission before on Havard Street.

306
00:29:27,237 --> 00:29:31,421
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's a lot of issues and I'm looking around.

307
00:29:31,922 --> 00:29:37,528
[SPEAKER_08]: There's not a lot of people here and for Havard Street, you know the traffic on Havard Street and you know the people on Havard Street.

308
00:29:39,062 --> 00:29:45,565
[SPEAKER_08]: There should be a lot more people up here other than just four or five of us talking, especially with the impact that this is going to have.

309
00:29:46,446 --> 00:29:51,249
[SPEAKER_08]: School buses alone, it's a big safety issue, and you're coming into holiday season.

310
00:29:52,149 --> 00:30:06,238
[SPEAKER_08]: So try to push it out a little bit more and get some more people, some more thoughts, but there needs to be some more action for this particular construction to go on.

311
00:30:07,216 --> 00:30:07,516
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

312
00:30:07,656 --> 00:30:07,997
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

313
00:30:13,461 --> 00:30:13,921
[SPEAKER_19]: Good evening.

314
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:15,162
[SPEAKER_19]: Congratulations everybody.

315
00:30:15,722 --> 00:30:20,226
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, the concern I have is, you know, what Harvard is a very, very busy street.

316
00:30:21,126 --> 00:30:22,347
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a lot of traffic every day.

317
00:30:22,367 --> 00:30:24,088
[SPEAKER_19]: Do we have a plan?

318
00:30:24,108 --> 00:30:31,494
[SPEAKER_19]: Has anybody seen a plan on what they would do for alternative routes for people to take, you know, regardless of school buses or,

319
00:30:32,619 --> 00:30:37,804
[SPEAKER_19]: construction trucks with the green line going up, the concrete trucks that you see every day going up there.

320
00:30:39,405 --> 00:30:40,006
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a concern.

321
00:30:40,406 --> 00:30:41,407
[SPEAKER_19]: Where's the traffic going to go?

322
00:30:41,447 --> 00:30:48,393
[SPEAKER_19]: Because right now, Bonner Avenue, tremendously overcrowded in the mornings, in the afternoons.

323
00:30:49,554 --> 00:30:50,975
[SPEAKER_19]: Golden Avenue, all those areas.

324
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:56,640
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's going to affect people driving around in the area trying to make it back and forth to work.

325
00:30:57,361 --> 00:31:01,863
[SPEAKER_19]: get back home, and I just wish that before they started this.

326
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:15,390
[SPEAKER_19]: First of all, I don't agree with the time frame when they're going to do it, because based on some of the previous work that they've done, it hasn't been broom cleaned and has to be re-repaired.

327
00:31:17,831 --> 00:31:19,052
[SPEAKER_19]: Winter time is going to be tough.

328
00:31:19,592 --> 00:31:26,796
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, I might as well just put sand back in the holes there, because the concrete or whatever they put there, I don't think it's going to make it through the winter season.

329
00:31:27,662 --> 00:31:29,969
[SPEAKER_19]: The most important thing, I think, is the people that have stores.

330
00:31:32,858 --> 00:31:34,182
[SPEAKER_19]: This is a busy season for them.

331
00:31:34,222 --> 00:31:34,985
[SPEAKER_19]: You have the Oasis.

332
00:31:38,885 --> 00:31:45,029
[SPEAKER_19]: This is when a lot of people make their money because of all the different parties they have for the holiday season and everything.

333
00:31:45,629 --> 00:31:50,271
[SPEAKER_19]: So, I mean, I don't even know that these people, the store owners, were made aware of this.

334
00:31:50,291 --> 00:31:55,214
[SPEAKER_19]: The most important thing is, where are you going to get your cannolis for Thanksgiving?

335
00:31:55,294 --> 00:31:57,635
[SPEAKER_19]: That's what I'm more concerned about, Mr. Theodore.

336
00:31:57,715 --> 00:31:58,436
[SPEAKER_19]: That's right.

337
00:31:58,676 --> 00:32:01,417
[SPEAKER_19]: But anyways, I would expect more from National Grid.

338
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:06,839
[SPEAKER_19]: And I know you guys will do what you have to do to get things squared away.

339
00:32:06,919 --> 00:32:07,299
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

340
00:32:07,779 --> 00:32:08,579
[SPEAKER_17]: We appreciate it.

341
00:32:09,199 --> 00:32:15,901
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, I think this is, we just had a Committee of the Whole meeting with the project being done with Eversource.

342
00:32:16,001 --> 00:32:23,983
[SPEAKER_17]: And one of the biggest things we talked about is, as we move forward with that before we approve it, is having more of community input and making sure we have community meetings.

343
00:32:24,503 --> 00:32:28,166
[SPEAKER_17]: So I find this disheartening that this has happened again to this neighborhood.

344
00:32:28,206 --> 00:32:31,709
[SPEAKER_17]: So, um, I know that you have champions behind this rail.

345
00:32:31,729 --> 00:32:34,031
[SPEAKER_17]: They're going to make sure that we can do what we can right now.

346
00:32:34,091 --> 00:32:36,433
[SPEAKER_17]: So, uh, Mr. Vice president, if you can.

347
00:32:36,553 --> 00:32:40,416
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, if I could, and I want to thank the residents for coming up tonight.

348
00:32:40,436 --> 00:32:45,020
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, where, where this is a non emergent job.

349
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,502
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I know it's dealing with a gas line.

350
00:32:48,123 --> 00:32:53,287
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, I think it's crucial that, uh, the city and I'm not going to point the finger at

351
00:32:53,909 --> 00:32:54,930
[SPEAKER_09]: uh, the utility company.

352
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:59,813
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the city that represents the residents of this community, not the utility company.

353
00:33:00,293 --> 00:33:03,556
[SPEAKER_09]: The city should have a clerk of the work assigned to the project.

354
00:33:04,156 --> 00:33:11,921
[SPEAKER_09]: Residents should be aware of exactly who in the city is the contact person for every project that's taken place in this community.

355
00:33:12,662 --> 00:33:18,446
[SPEAKER_09]: And, uh, if a traffic plan, as, uh, uh, Mr. D Antonio mentioned, uh, is out there,

356
00:33:19,016 --> 00:33:27,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone should be aware if they're going to be closing off certain sections, if they're going to be diverting traffic, everyone in that area should be aware, Mr. President.

357
00:33:28,108 --> 00:33:32,233
[SPEAKER_09]: And I have yet to hear anyone that's aware of anything that's going on with this project.

358
00:33:32,914 --> 00:33:36,959
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, the fact that it is not an emergency project, to me,

359
00:33:37,489 --> 00:33:42,313
[SPEAKER_09]: The city should be sitting down with National Grid and talking about mitigation.

360
00:33:42,974 --> 00:33:43,875
[SPEAKER_09]: What can we do?

361
00:33:44,696 --> 00:33:48,739
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we realize lines get older and so forth and need replacement.

362
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,961
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think anyone doubts that.

363
00:33:51,562 --> 00:34:00,210
[SPEAKER_09]: But on behalf of the residents of this community, we should be able to sit down with these utility companies and request certain things, Mr. President.

364
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:07,003
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know on Harvard, uh, you know, we've talked about broken sidewalks at nauseam, uh, up and down Harvard street.

365
00:34:07,443 --> 00:34:17,050
[SPEAKER_09]: Wouldn't it be nice to be able to go to the utility company and say, you know what, uh, because of the inconvenience, we would ask that you replace, you know, 30 different sidewalks on Harvard.

366
00:34:17,771 --> 00:34:25,276
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, you know, to me that that's a no brainer that that should, those discussions should be happening between the city and the utility companies.

367
00:34:25,937 --> 00:34:29,960
[SPEAKER_09]: And, uh, I think all they're doing is approving things and no follow up.

368
00:34:30,529 --> 00:34:32,510
[SPEAKER_09]: and we're seeing it time and time again.

369
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:48,177
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would ask Mr. President in the form of a motion that a clerk of the works be assigned to this project immediately and the residents be notified who in the city is going to be the contact person for this particular project.

370
00:34:48,557 --> 00:35:00,182
[SPEAKER_09]: The traffic plan be provided also, Mr. President, whether it's on the website so city residents can view it or that the director butters receive a copy of the traffic plan

371
00:35:00,714 --> 00:35:05,535
[SPEAKER_09]: And also that, going forward, that the city discuss mitigation.

372
00:35:06,136 --> 00:35:17,919
[SPEAKER_09]: When a project of this size comes in and it's going to be an impact to the community through traffic, through noise, through disruption of everyday quality of life, as was mentioned, you get the holidays coming up.

373
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:29,482
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, these are the things that we should be using as leverage with the utility companies to get them, Mr. President, to do curb to curb, as we've talked about, restoration,

374
00:35:29,938 --> 00:35:38,510
[SPEAKER_09]: rather than just restoration in the area where they're digging, new sidewalks, new handicap ramps, improved lighting, whatever it might be.

375
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:41,995
[SPEAKER_09]: But this is the time to hit up these multi-billion dollar companies.

376
00:35:42,729 --> 00:35:44,391
[SPEAKER_09]: on behalf of the residents of this community.

377
00:35:44,731 --> 00:35:48,995
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would offer those three initiatives, Mr. President, in the form of a motion.

378
00:35:49,475 --> 00:35:49,895
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

379
00:35:49,935 --> 00:36:02,526
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion, Vice President Mast, that we amend the paper that be forwarded, the mitigation, the Traffic Plan, and the Clerk of the Works.

380
00:36:03,687 --> 00:36:04,628
[SPEAKER_17]: neighbor communication.

381
00:36:04,668 --> 00:36:08,771
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's the four pieces I believe that we need to send to the administration.

382
00:36:09,771 --> 00:36:11,072
[SPEAKER_17]: It's amended.

383
00:36:11,132 --> 00:36:11,453
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

384
00:36:11,473 --> 00:36:14,875
[SPEAKER_17]: So second, uh, Councilor Knight, all in favor.

385
00:36:15,375 --> 00:36:15,455
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

386
00:36:16,036 --> 00:36:16,616
[SPEAKER_17]: All opposed.

387
00:36:17,837 --> 00:36:18,497
[SPEAKER_17]: The ayes have it.

388
00:36:20,839 --> 00:36:21,440
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President.

389
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:24,402
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

390
00:36:24,442 --> 00:36:32,107
[SPEAKER_09]: We received the correspondence, um, from the, uh, city solicitor, uh, to Mayor Burke regarding council resolution.

391
00:36:33,137 --> 00:36:34,238
[SPEAKER_09]: 16 dash seven eight three.

392
00:36:34,838 --> 00:36:50,126
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, this was a resolution I offered well over a year ago that the city and the city, the city council and their wisdom, uh, asked that, uh, an ordinance be drafted up by the city solicitor who I am very grateful, uh, took the time to draft this up.

393
00:36:50,706 --> 00:36:59,531
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I would like to send this particular paper to the subcommittee on business and economic development, uh, just for the edification of the viewing audience.

394
00:37:00,191 --> 00:37:02,132
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, this is a consumer protection ordinance.

395
00:37:02,897 --> 00:37:05,759
[SPEAKER_09]: And if I could just read it briefly, Mr. President, please do.

396
00:37:05,999 --> 00:37:30,276
[SPEAKER_09]: It says dear mayor Burke and the above caption resolution, the city council requested that the city solicitor draft an ordinance requiring any retail or wholesale business, which is made aware of an incorrect store price that has the ability to communicate with the customer through the offering of a store savings card or other method method be required to refund or credit

397
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:34,183
[SPEAKER_09]: all customers who purchase an item marked incorrectly.

398
00:37:35,465 --> 00:37:46,796
[SPEAKER_09]: It goes on to say the code of mass regulations already requires prompt payment be made to customers who have been overcharged and the store owners maintain a price accuracy and missing price report.

399
00:37:47,256 --> 00:37:53,242
[SPEAKER_09]: This takes it one step further, Mr. President, and I think it really is a consumer-friendly ordinance

400
00:37:53,837 --> 00:37:58,199
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm not aware of anyone in this state that has an ordinance like this.

401
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:07,363
[SPEAKER_09]: But once a store is on notice of an incorrect price, you can go up and talk to the store manager and they'll reimburse you the difference.

402
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:10,324
[SPEAKER_09]: Some stores will even give you the item for free.

403
00:38:10,985 --> 00:38:13,526
[SPEAKER_09]: What I'm asking, Mr. President, we take it one step further.

404
00:38:13,886 --> 00:38:16,467
[SPEAKER_09]: In this day and age with technology and store cards and

405
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:32,076
[SPEAKER_09]: credit and debit cards and everything else, that store, once they're on notice that a price is incorrectly marked, they should be able to go through that day's worth of receipts and see who else bought that item and maybe wasn't savvy enough to pick up on the incorrect price.

406
00:38:32,636 --> 00:38:44,265
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they reach out to the customer and either a debit credit, their debit card or their charge card, or send them out, uh, the difference in the meal, Mr. President, um, on the difference,

407
00:38:44,804 --> 00:38:47,004
[SPEAKER_09]: uh, and price that was incorrectly marked.

408
00:38:47,645 --> 00:39:04,168
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, Steve, uh, Champoli, who's our, uh, director of seal of weights and measures, uh, reviewed this language and, uh, his, I don't want to quote him, but he said he can't wait to get this enacted so he can start enforcing it, Mr. President.

409
00:39:04,968 --> 00:39:13,130
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so I would ask that it be sent to the subcommittee for, uh, its due diligence and vetting and, uh, eventual passage.

410
00:39:13,906 --> 00:39:18,248
[SPEAKER_09]: of this very important consumer-friendly protection ordinance, Mr. President.

411
00:39:18,268 --> 00:39:18,888
[SPEAKER_09]: Second, Mr. Chairman.

412
00:39:19,468 --> 00:39:21,149
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

413
00:39:21,369 --> 00:39:23,350
[SPEAKER_17]: I remember the resolution is very important.

414
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:25,030
[SPEAKER_17]: Consumers appreciate it.

415
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:33,634
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're going to, on the motion, seconded by Councilor Dela Russo that this go to subcommittee on economics.

416
00:39:33,874 --> 00:39:34,934
[SPEAKER_17]: Business and economic development.

417
00:39:34,954 --> 00:39:36,295
[SPEAKER_17]: Business and economic development.

418
00:39:36,615 --> 00:39:38,356
[SPEAKER_17]: Name and address for the record.

419
00:39:39,336 --> 00:39:39,576
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

420
00:39:41,247 --> 00:39:50,251
[SPEAKER_21]: On that vein of overcharging consumers, I would like to share a story that happened to me.

421
00:39:50,331 --> 00:39:59,255
[SPEAKER_21]: I bought $20 worth of gasoline a few weeks back in this city at a gas station.

422
00:40:00,676 --> 00:40:02,217
[SPEAKER_21]: Mathematics, I sort of know.

423
00:40:02,897 --> 00:40:05,078
[SPEAKER_21]: It was 7.5 gallons.

424
00:40:05,918 --> 00:40:09,400
[SPEAKER_21]: I thought it should have been 8 gallons because it was exactly

425
00:40:10,543 --> 00:40:12,664
[SPEAKER_21]: $2.49 and nine-tenths per gallon.

426
00:40:13,164 --> 00:40:16,645
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm thinking there should be eight gallons for $20.

427
00:40:17,585 --> 00:40:26,148
[SPEAKER_21]: And I questioned the attendant who poured the gas into my vehicle, and he says, I just work here, you know.

428
00:40:27,048 --> 00:40:33,370
[SPEAKER_21]: And so I guess what I'm trying to say is people should probably pay attention at the gas pumps.

429
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:37,971
[SPEAKER_21]: And I brought gas to the following same station weeks later,

430
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:42,797
[SPEAKER_21]: And it came out exactly eight gallons at $2.50 a gallon.

431
00:40:43,018 --> 00:40:44,018
[SPEAKER_21]: So it was corrected.

432
00:40:44,919 --> 00:40:50,003
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not sure about the weights and measures, if that was just an abnormality or what.

433
00:40:50,584 --> 00:40:51,545
[SPEAKER_21]: That's all I wanted to say.

434
00:40:51,665 --> 00:40:52,045
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

435
00:40:52,065 --> 00:41:03,555
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe at the end of the meeting, Mr. Cassin, if you could give us the name of that company that we can actually, not publicly, but ask the weights and measures director, Mr. Champoli, to look into that.

436
00:41:03,595 --> 00:41:06,998
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what his job is, to make sure those ones

437
00:41:08,056 --> 00:41:09,816
[SPEAKER_21]: I understand, but I'm a sub-Method graduate.

438
00:41:09,836 --> 00:41:13,237
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't like to be so-called Mr. Belgian rat.

439
00:41:13,497 --> 00:41:13,957
[SPEAKER_17]: Leave a note.

440
00:41:14,397 --> 00:41:17,078
[SPEAKER_21]: But I will keep an eye on that station.

441
00:41:17,098 --> 00:41:17,418
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

442
00:41:17,618 --> 00:41:17,998
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

443
00:41:18,118 --> 00:41:29,461
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, just if I could, just for the education of the viewing audience, Mr. Champoli is responsible for all scales in the community, as well as pumps.

444
00:41:29,961 --> 00:41:35,802
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you look at any of the gas pumps, it should have a dated sticker on it that shows that it was re-inspected

445
00:41:36,377 --> 00:41:40,740
[SPEAKER_09]: uh, not only for accuracy, but also the octane level, uh, is checked at the pumps too.

446
00:41:41,201 --> 00:41:44,943
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you provide that information, uh, we can definitely add that to his list.

447
00:41:45,404 --> 00:41:45,644
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

448
00:41:45,664 --> 00:41:48,586
[SPEAKER_17]: They also do the oil trucks and all our cabs too.

449
00:41:48,706 --> 00:41:50,667
[SPEAKER_17]: So, um, okay.

450
00:41:50,727 --> 00:41:57,272
[SPEAKER_17]: On that, on that motion seconded by council dollar Russo to, uh, move this paper to subcommittee.

451
00:41:57,777 --> 00:41:59,158
[SPEAKER_17]: On economic development, all in favor?

472
00:43:04,026 --> 00:43:10,509

473
00:43:10,529 --> 00:43:16,791
[SPEAKER_15]: So maybe we can mark that up to make sure that we get a report back from our code enforcement officer to make sure that there have been no complaints filed.
