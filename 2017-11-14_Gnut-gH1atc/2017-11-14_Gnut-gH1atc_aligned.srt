1
00:01:14,974 --> 00:01:15,037
you

2
00:05:53,183 --> 00:05:56,647
The 35th regular meeting of the Meffitt City Council will be called to order.

3
00:06:01,572 --> 00:06:02,473
Clerk, call the roll.

4
00:06:03,914 --> 00:06:04,655
Councilor DelaRosso.

5
00:06:04,695 --> 00:06:04,955
Present.

6
00:06:05,035 --> 00:06:07,638
Councilor Falcone.

7
00:06:07,698 --> 00:06:07,958
Present.

8
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:08,959
Councilor Layton.

9
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,320
Present.

10
00:06:24,934 --> 00:06:25,754
Chairman Marks.

11
00:06:26,255 --> 00:06:26,595
Present.

12
00:06:27,015 --> 00:06:28,356
Five present, two absent.

13
00:06:28,717 --> 00:06:30,158
Please rise to salute the flag.

14
00:06:31,659 --> 00:06:42,468
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

15
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:49,294
Motion to suspend the rules, to take papers under suspension.

16
00:06:50,515 --> 00:06:51,936
Councilor Del Russo, all in favor?

17
00:06:53,476 --> 00:06:58,181
paper 17 dash seven five one offered by council a night be resolved.

18
00:06:58,241 --> 00:07:14,318
City solicitor in conjunction with the chief of police and building commissioner provide the council with a draft ordinance establishing safety standards, regulating the commercial display and storage of firearms, ammunition and firearm accessories in the city of method.

19
00:07:15,118 --> 00:07:15,699
Council night.

20
00:07:16,301 --> 00:07:17,662
Mr. President, thank you very much.

21
00:07:18,362 --> 00:07:26,088
Looking back in the newspaper over the summer, I think if we all recall a police standoff up in Saugus along Route 1.

22
00:07:26,348 --> 00:07:33,132
And what happened was the gentleman had made his way into a Dick's Sporting Goods up in Route 1 and got his hands on some firearms, Mr. President.

23
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:34,953
And this resulted in a police standoff.

24
00:07:34,973 --> 00:07:36,734
They closed down Route 1 for a number of hours.

25
00:07:37,535 --> 00:07:40,577
Recently in our community, we were very lucky to open up a Dick's Sporting Goods.

26
00:07:41,187 --> 00:07:44,711
And this Dick's Sporting Goods is a great, great facility.

27
00:07:44,771 --> 00:07:50,156
However, they do sell some questionable material that I don't personally support, which would be firearms, Mr. President.

28
00:07:50,276 --> 00:07:55,461
But this is in no way, shape, or form an attempt to push back on people's Second Amendment rights.

29
00:07:55,521 --> 00:07:59,145
Mr. President, what it is is an effort to regulate

30
00:08:00,168 --> 00:08:06,429
The safe storage and sale and display of firearms, ammunition, and firearm accessories in the city of Medford.

31
00:08:06,709 --> 00:08:09,030
You know, the cat's out of the barn, the horse is out of the barn.

32
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:11,270
We have a facility here in the community that's selling firearms.

33
00:08:11,731 --> 00:08:17,492
I think it's incumbent upon us as a council to take all the steps that are necessary to ensure that we maintain that the community remains safe.

34
00:08:18,172 --> 00:08:27,614
So with that being said, Mr. President, I bring this forward as a conversation starter, a spot for us to jump off from a launching pad, if you want to call it that, for us to start this discussion and have this conversation.

35
00:08:28,317 --> 00:08:32,780
Um, so with that being said, Mr. President asked my council colleagues to support the measure and move for approvals.

36
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:35,821
Thank you.

37
00:08:35,861 --> 00:08:36,442
Councilor Knight.

38
00:08:38,203 --> 00:08:39,864
Second by Councilor Falco.

39
00:08:39,944 --> 00:08:40,784
Councilor Del Russo.

40
00:08:40,884 --> 00:08:45,167
I support this as a conversation, uh, started Mr. Chairman.

41
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:48,168
On the motion.

42
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:49,349
All those in favor?

43
00:08:49,649 --> 00:08:49,809
Aye.

44
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:50,830
Opposed?

45
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,151
The ayes have it.

46
00:08:52,831 --> 00:08:54,112
The motion is adopted.

47
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:58,201
Motion to take papers in the hands of the city clerk.

48
00:09:00,462 --> 00:09:02,123
Second motion.

49
00:09:02,343 --> 00:09:05,325
Do we have any other papers?

50
00:09:07,407 --> 00:09:07,587
Right.

51
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:10,329
So papers in the hands of the city clerk.

52
00:09:11,729 --> 00:09:12,550
I think there's three more.

53
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:14,311
You've got 17, seven 52 under suspension.

54
00:09:21,496 --> 00:09:28,018
Under suspension 17-752, administration refund taxpayers in the city council, November 14th, 2017.

55
00:09:28,598 --> 00:09:35,880
I'll move after this.

56
00:09:39,061 --> 00:09:39,601
Councilor Knight.

57
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,236
Mr. President, thank you very much.

58
00:09:44,516 --> 00:09:57,183
This paper here is paper 17752, which reads, be it resolved the city administration refund taxpayers all convenience fees incurred during the current fiscal year as a result of the online payment of tax bills issued by the city.

59
00:09:57,704 --> 00:10:03,327
And be it further resolved that the city administration take the necessary steps to eliminate or assume such fees going forward.

60
00:10:04,108 --> 00:10:11,197
Mr. President, I've run into several situations, gotten several phone calls, bumped into people that have attempted to pay their property tax bills online.

61
00:10:11,738 --> 00:10:16,604
And when they go in there to pay their property tax bill, they are assessed a convenience fee.

62
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,108
The last one that I heard was upwards of close to $50, Mr. President.

63
00:10:20,849 --> 00:10:22,410
And that doesn't sound too convenient to me.

64
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:23,711
We're sitting here in the community.

65
00:10:23,731 --> 00:10:25,092
We're asking robocalls to go out.

66
00:10:25,112 --> 00:10:26,714
We're asking things to get posted on the website.

67
00:10:26,734 --> 00:10:29,636
We're asking people to utilize technology more and more.

68
00:10:29,956 --> 00:10:31,337
We shouldn't be charging them to do it.

69
00:10:31,357 --> 00:10:33,839
We should be encouraging it, not discouraging it, Mr. President.

70
00:10:33,859 --> 00:10:39,843
So I'm asking that the administration look into this and to take the appropriate steps to either waive the fee, assume the fee, or eliminate the fee.

71
00:10:42,105 --> 00:10:42,866
Mr. Chairman.

72
00:10:43,486 --> 00:10:44,327
Counsel Del Rosso.

73
00:10:47,196 --> 00:10:58,419
I have a little R after my name, so I'm the last person that wants to see people taxed, especially when they get taxed that come up from behind them.

74
00:10:59,019 --> 00:11:15,884
So this could be construed at that, but I would want to hear an explanation about this from either the treasurer or Alicia Nunley on what our expenses are and how this is something that can, if not,

75
00:11:16,317 --> 00:11:20,040
I wouldn't want to see people pay $50 every just to pay a bill.

76
00:11:20,861 --> 00:11:43,578
Um, but I certainly, uh, uh, know that at some point, uh, to provide that, uh, so I support this, but I'd like it, uh, uh, to, uh, amend it that, uh, we get an explanation in person from, uh, the appropriate person from the, uh, city administration regarding these financial matters.

77
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:45,039
If that's,

78
00:11:46,603 --> 00:11:49,326
amenable to the presenter of the resolution.

79
00:11:51,467 --> 00:11:52,828
In the spirit thereof.

80
00:11:53,109 --> 00:11:54,850
I certainly have no problem with that, Mr. President.

81
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:58,913
If we're going to take a vote, I want it to be an informed vote, and I want everybody behind the rail to be comfortable with it.

82
00:11:59,894 --> 00:12:09,742
With that being said, I'd be happy to even withhold the request until we have the presentation from the treasurer or the financial director, whatever the council feels comfortable with.

83
00:12:09,802 --> 00:12:13,726
Again, I just think this is an opportunity for us to get... They can be simultaneous.

84
00:12:16,044 --> 00:12:19,145
most things move.

85
00:12:19,165 --> 00:12:20,405
You want to refer to subcommittee?

86
00:12:22,285 --> 00:12:24,086
We can do that too.

87
00:12:24,146 --> 00:12:24,986
Audit and finance.

88
00:12:25,086 --> 00:12:25,346
Is that?

89
00:12:27,206 --> 00:12:28,186
No, that's moving along.

90
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,207
That's fine.

91
00:12:30,307 --> 00:12:34,468
I mean, my motion is to have it passed, but, um, you know, go to the administration.

92
00:12:34,508 --> 00:12:41,469
But if the council has questions, then I have no problem, um, going along with whatever it is that it will take to make sure that this comes to fruition.

93
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:46,884
So the motion on the floor is by Council Light to have this submitted to the city administration.

94
00:12:47,264 --> 00:12:48,044
All those in favor?

95
00:12:49,105 --> 00:12:49,505
Opposed?

96
00:12:49,525 --> 00:12:52,106
Did you amend it, Councilor?

97
00:12:52,126 --> 00:12:52,746
I amended it, yes.

98
00:12:52,826 --> 00:12:57,288
Just to ask that we have an in-person explanation of why this is going on.

99
00:12:58,849 --> 00:13:00,349
Before we send it to the administration?

100
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:01,970
Simultaneously.

101
00:13:04,831 --> 00:13:05,651
All those in favor?

102
00:13:05,811 --> 00:13:06,092
Aye.

103
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:06,932
Opposed?

104
00:13:07,552 --> 00:13:09,353
The ayes have it, the motion is adopted.

105
00:13:10,365 --> 00:13:11,706
efficiency, Mr. President.

106
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:17,372
Papers in the hands of the clerk offered by Councilor Moxby resolved that the sidewalk in front of one 10, one 12,

107
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,420
Warren Street be replaced in the interest of public safety?

108
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:22,241
Move approval.

109
00:13:22,521 --> 00:13:23,341
Motion for approval.

110
00:13:23,661 --> 00:13:24,381
All those in favor?

111
00:13:25,081 --> 00:13:25,521
Opposed?

112
00:13:25,561 --> 00:13:26,161
The ayes have it.

113
00:13:26,281 --> 00:13:27,441
The motion is adopted.

114
00:13:27,942 --> 00:13:39,143
Offered by Councilor Marks, we resolve that the electronic speed sign be placed after Winthrop Circle heading toward West Meffitt Square on High Street in the interest of public safety.

115
00:13:39,824 --> 00:13:41,164
Move approval, Mr. President.

116
00:13:41,524 --> 00:13:47,985
If I may, Mr. President, as you're well aware, and I'm sure has been reported to you in why you put this on there,

117
00:13:48,465 --> 00:13:56,752
is that we have certainly a lot of hasty driving there that has resulted in a number of bad situations, Mr. President.

118
00:13:57,293 --> 00:14:00,095
And I think that would be a good place for that monitoring.

119
00:14:00,595 --> 00:14:08,082
It serves to quell and remind people of their own behaviors, especially since there's been a citywide adjustment in the speed limit.

120
00:14:08,755 --> 00:14:09,475
Thank you, Councilor.

121
00:14:09,535 --> 00:14:11,096
On the motion, all those in favor?

122
00:14:11,316 --> 00:14:11,456
Aye.

123
00:14:11,757 --> 00:14:12,177
Opposed?

124
00:14:12,857 --> 00:14:13,498
The ayes have it.

125
00:14:13,558 --> 00:14:14,738
The motion is adopted.

126
00:14:15,419 --> 00:14:25,124
Offered by Councilor Marks, be resolved that the street pole number 4354 at 41 Mangles be replaced in the interest of public safety.

127
00:14:25,344 --> 00:14:25,824
Move the pole.

128
00:14:26,344 --> 00:14:27,145
All those in favor?

129
00:14:27,165 --> 00:14:27,225
Aye.

130
00:14:28,145 --> 00:14:28,586
Opposed?

131
00:14:29,426 --> 00:14:30,066
The ayes have it.

132
00:14:30,086 --> 00:14:31,407
The motion is adopted.

133
00:14:32,488 --> 00:14:34,489
Motion to revert back to regular order of business.

134
00:14:35,598 --> 00:14:36,319
All those in favor?

135
00:14:36,619 --> 00:14:36,719
Aye.

136
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:37,400
Opposed?

137
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,041
The ayes have it.

138
00:14:38,901 --> 00:14:50,133
Motions, orders, and resolutions 17-750 offered by vice president Mox, be resolved that the construction work on Harvard street from main street to Benton road be discussed.

139
00:15:14,957 --> 00:15:15,978
Thank you, Mr. President.

140
00:15:16,398 --> 00:15:28,542
Um, we all received, uh, uh, several emails regarding the, uh, national grid, uh, is determined that a gas main on Harvard street for main street to Benton road will be replaced.

141
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:39,286
Um, starting Monday, November 13th, uh, which was yesterday lasting four weeks, taking a place Monday through Friday from 7.00 PM to 5.00 AM.

142
00:15:40,006 --> 00:15:41,487
That was the original request.

143
00:15:42,142 --> 00:15:50,284
uh, since then, uh, there's been some, uh, emails going back and forth, uh, that the work will now take place during the day.

144
00:15:51,185 --> 00:15:57,326
And, um, I have yet to get confirmation from chief Sacco who needs to make that decision.

145
00:15:57,907 --> 00:16:10,090
But, um, the concerns I've heard from residents, and I know many of my colleagues have, uh, was really the lack of notification of residents in the area and the lack of input from any residents.

146
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:17,587
Some residents found out through finding a flyer on the street that this work was going to take place.

147
00:16:18,427 --> 00:16:36,997
And many homes in the area that directly abut this and whose bedroom windows are located within 20 feet from potential construction at night naturally would have some grave concerns about sleep disruption during a four week span.

148
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:39,598
I know there's a number of residents

149
00:16:40,131 --> 00:16:43,413
here that would like to speak on the issue, Mr. President.

150
00:16:44,114 --> 00:17:01,745
And again, I would ask that this project be duly notified through Reverse 911 in the city, Mr. President, alerting residents when this work will take place, how long the work will take, and when it will be done.

151
00:17:02,525 --> 00:17:08,449
If it's going to be during the day or the evening is extremely important, Mr. President, that residents are aware of this.

152
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:14,040
So at this time I'd open the floor if anyone from the direct abuttance would like to speak.

153
00:17:17,881 --> 00:17:18,841
Good evening.

154
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:19,741
Good evening.

155
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:20,261
Yes.

156
00:17:20,461 --> 00:17:21,901
My name is Angela Ferrari.

157
00:17:22,061 --> 00:17:24,702
I live at two 15 Harvard street and my unit is 19.

158
00:17:24,862 --> 00:17:34,823
I'm directly on Harvard street and most certainly the entire area right up outside my door and bedroom will be affected by this.

159
00:17:35,624 --> 00:17:37,724
Um, as you mentioned, we learned of this.

160
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:44,791
by a flyer, this flyer being taped to my outside door on last Friday afternoon.

161
00:17:45,091 --> 00:17:47,532
So that was literally four days, five, four days ago.

162
00:17:48,312 --> 00:17:50,092
Um, I knew nothing about this until then.

163
00:17:50,572 --> 00:18:00,454
And clearly I don't think any of the other, uh, condo owners at the Lincoln Kennedy school, um, complex learned about it either until we got these notices.

164
00:18:01,294 --> 00:18:04,195
This opens up obviously a whole plethora of issues.

165
00:18:04,675 --> 00:18:06,495
Um, not only the,

166
00:18:07,251 --> 00:18:12,574
original idea of working overnight, which still has yet to be resolved.

167
00:18:13,094 --> 00:18:18,598
So we as residents don't know if we're going to be disrupted overnight or in the day.

168
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:28,623
But clearly we all object to the overnight work because that means none of us will get any sleep for four or five weeks, whatever this work is slated to be done by.

169
00:18:30,796 --> 00:18:36,713
But even if it does go in the daytime, and I understand that they need to upgrade this work.

170
00:18:36,753 --> 00:18:38,137
I understand that it needs to be done.

171
00:18:38,632 --> 00:18:49,016
What they didn't do is get the residents input as to how that's going to affect us by way of the fact that we are a private association.

172
00:18:49,056 --> 00:18:51,677
We are a private property.

173
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:59,640
So what happens is a lot of times we get individuals cutting through our property to turn around and go the alternate way.

174
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:05,602
It didn't take into effect that the workers will be there extremely early in the morning.

175
00:19:06,161 --> 00:19:15,308
to with big trucks digging or needing to park or causing dust up or issues for people that might have health problems.

176
00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:21,413
None of that was discussed or even brought to the property owners and gotten input by.

177
00:19:21,453 --> 00:19:24,235
There were a lot of families in these units.

178
00:19:25,216 --> 00:19:32,562
So clearly both people who work and people who have families are going to be disrupted not only with needing to reroute

179
00:19:33,786 --> 00:19:36,767
going in and out of the homes or our parking spaces.

180
00:19:38,908 --> 00:19:42,429
And in addition to that, it's over the holidays.

181
00:19:43,149 --> 00:19:45,829
I mean, they've chosen a very difficult time of year.

182
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:54,092
It's holidays, it's, you know, now we potentially could be faced with weather issues that could delay the construction from being finished.

183
00:19:54,492 --> 00:20:01,034
So now we're looking potentially going into like, you know, mid to late December, if that's the case, you know, if we do have some weather issues.

184
00:20:03,427 --> 00:20:20,021
Beyond that, I think there's a part of this notice that says, temporary or permanent restoration of disturbed areas will be in accordance with the town ordinance.

185
00:20:21,002 --> 00:20:31,071
So that doesn't give us a lot of faith that the street being ripped up is going to be returned to the current state that it's in.

186
00:20:32,984 --> 00:20:44,911
Myself, as a resident, had a problem with a manhole cover that was constantly banging, and I raised the issue and complained about it for the last year and a half, almost two years.

187
00:20:45,431 --> 00:20:55,357
And less than a month or two ago, I finally got that manhole cover fixed, and I finally was able to start getting a good night's sleep with it banging constantly.

188
00:20:55,917 --> 00:20:59,479
What this is now saying is it's going to rip up the entire street over again.

189
00:21:00,114 --> 00:21:08,966
And when is, you know, then we're dealing with when are these original, the original state of the road going to be back to normal, somewhat normal.

190
00:21:09,587 --> 00:21:14,914
In addition, recently over the summer, the intersection of Main Street and Harvard

191
00:21:16,037 --> 00:21:24,223
that had had terrible bumps and divots in the road right by a business on the corner there, finally got repaired.

192
00:21:24,643 --> 00:21:26,405
And now that's going to be all ripped up.

193
00:21:26,525 --> 00:21:29,287
So I guess there's a number of concerns.

194
00:21:29,327 --> 00:21:32,570
The disruption, the noise, the lack of notice.

195
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:36,933
We're not confirmed when they're going to do the work, whether it's day or night.

196
00:21:38,834 --> 00:21:47,159
potential delays in case there's weather, and then of course what the road status is gonna be back to normal if and when it's gonna finally be back after they rip it all up.

197
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:56,224
And then we all have to make individual appointments for National Grid to connect our service again.

198
00:21:56,664 --> 00:22:01,447
So there's like a number of steps that is going to take place according to their notice.

199
00:22:01,747 --> 00:22:06,950
And I don't know if you've received a copy of the notice, which if you haven't, I'd be happy to give you mine or make a copy.

200
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:07,170
Yeah.

201
00:22:10,738 --> 00:22:11,018
Great.

202
00:22:11,138 --> 00:22:11,518
Thank you.

203
00:22:14,179 --> 00:22:17,400
I think it would be important for you to have that so that you can refer to it.

204
00:22:17,841 --> 00:22:29,465
But you know, I for one understand and I'm happy that they're doing an upgrade, but I think that it just completely could have been, been handled more appropriately and gotten input from the residents.

205
00:22:30,086 --> 00:22:31,806
Thank you very much for my hearing.

206
00:22:32,447 --> 00:22:33,227
Thank you.

207
00:22:33,387 --> 00:22:34,007
Any questions?

208
00:22:34,067 --> 00:22:34,207
No.

209
00:22:34,387 --> 00:22:34,467
Okay.

210
00:22:34,487 --> 00:22:34,668
Thanks.

211
00:22:34,948 --> 00:22:35,548
Thank you.

212
00:22:38,643 --> 00:22:39,083
Good evening.

213
00:22:39,103 --> 00:22:40,725
Your name and address for the record.

214
00:22:41,045 --> 00:22:41,265
Hello.

215
00:22:41,285 --> 00:22:44,067
My name is Christopher Donovan, uh, full of rain road, Bedford mass.

216
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:45,468
Uh, just one question.

217
00:22:45,488 --> 00:22:53,214
Are we getting a new sidewalk up at, at winter path through this mitigation money through national grid to go back to the prior incident?

218
00:22:53,234 --> 00:22:54,635
We did discuss that.

219
00:22:54,715 --> 00:23:00,780
That's part of the 200 feet that we were told that Winthrop street will now have sidewalk throughout the,

220
00:23:01,522 --> 00:23:03,083
And that's national grid is going to take care of that.

221
00:23:03,323 --> 00:23:04,064
It's not a national grid.

222
00:23:04,084 --> 00:23:05,905
I believe it was ever source.

223
00:23:06,326 --> 00:23:07,506
That was already set.

224
00:23:07,606 --> 00:23:08,687
Is that something?

225
00:23:09,648 --> 00:23:12,570
And we'll be, that'll be part of next week's meeting too, I believe.

226
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:14,471
So we can see this part of the MOU.

227
00:23:14,511 --> 00:23:15,572
I believe it was in the MOU.

228
00:23:15,832 --> 00:23:15,993
Good.

229
00:23:16,113 --> 00:23:16,493
Thank you all.

230
00:23:16,513 --> 00:23:17,213
Congratulations.

231
00:23:17,674 --> 00:23:17,974
Thank you.

232
00:23:20,196 --> 00:23:20,576
Anyone else?

233
00:23:23,404 --> 00:23:23,684
Go ahead.

234
00:23:24,225 --> 00:23:29,149
I was kind of waiting to be the last one speaking because I'm the newest resident of Medford.

235
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:32,833
Maybe not the newest, but we moved in at the end of July.

236
00:23:32,853 --> 00:23:33,874
Congratulations.

237
00:23:34,374 --> 00:23:36,296
So maybe an address for the record.

238
00:23:36,316 --> 00:23:37,497
I'm Rod Marden.

239
00:23:37,517 --> 00:23:41,321
I'm at 215 Harvard street, unit 17.

240
00:23:42,482 --> 00:23:46,606
Uh, the honored neighbor of Angela who gave, uh,

241
00:23:47,262 --> 00:23:50,424
thorough, comprehensive presentation of the problems.

242
00:23:51,864 --> 00:24:08,793
The only thing that I would like to add to that is standing here, I'm very fortunate to be standing here today because when I moved in, for about five weeks in a row, I was not able to sleep because of that manhole cover.

243
00:24:10,114 --> 00:24:11,436
and my health deteriorated.

244
00:24:12,397 --> 00:24:14,781
My arrhythmia got much worse.

245
00:24:15,543 --> 00:24:19,349
I had to get an emergency appointment with Dr. Felton's office.

246
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:40,058
My concern when I saw this flyer and it was shoved into my door, I had a few questions, ones that were addressed by Angela, and also how much coordination was there between National Grid and the city of Medford?

247
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:46,220
I'm not sure if there was coordination with Chief Sacco, his department, regarding this.

248
00:24:47,661 --> 00:24:50,082
Many unanswered questions as to what's going to happen.

249
00:24:51,900 --> 00:25:04,666
I was very glad to see that things were changed to the daytime, but I'm not sure whether the change happened because of some pressure from emails or whether there was any sort of effort and coordination with the city.

250
00:25:05,366 --> 00:25:06,927
We have no information about that.

251
00:25:07,847 --> 00:25:12,610
And I think before work begins, there should be coordination with the city about this.

252
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:17,972
One other point, this is a street that's used by school buses.

253
00:25:20,509 --> 00:25:23,911
I have a concern of what's going to happen with the rerouting of those school buses.

254
00:25:24,792 --> 00:25:31,697
Uh, if the work was done over the summertime, there would probably, probably be a lot less disruption to the local public schools here.

255
00:25:31,717 --> 00:25:38,101
There's something that should be considered unless there's an emergency situation with the gas leak that they have to explore.

256
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:46,947
Uh, the fire gave some hint that they have to drill some holes or find out where the, uh, where the pipe is.

257
00:25:47,747 --> 00:25:49,669
I'm wondering whether they're doing anything about,

258
00:25:50,902 --> 00:25:53,224
whether there's a report of a gas leak or not.

259
00:25:54,264 --> 00:25:59,748
There's so many questions that have been left unanswered that the residents don't have the answers to.

260
00:26:00,769 --> 00:26:17,840
And I think that we need to take a look as Medford residents and as our elected representatives to make sure that this work proceeds in the healthiest and best way possible for the residents and for the city.

261
00:26:18,361 --> 00:26:18,641
Thank you.

262
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:32,495
Um, for one, I know that this council has worked very hard with making sure that our, uh, our natural grid never source and other utilities do what they need to do.

263
00:26:32,535 --> 00:26:33,555
So I find this disheartening.

264
00:26:34,036 --> 00:26:36,837
This will be the first time I'll see that, that announcement.

265
00:26:36,857 --> 00:26:40,738
So I think this is something that we'll, we'll get on as soon as we can.

266
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:44,900
So thank you for coming out tonight and, uh, and sharing your opinions.

267
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:45,260
Thank you.

268
00:26:46,061 --> 00:26:46,941
Um, we have a motion.

269
00:26:48,541 --> 00:26:49,721
Do you have any other, anyone else?

270
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:50,101
Sorry.

271
00:26:50,162 --> 00:27:00,885
How's it going?

272
00:27:01,185 --> 00:27:03,646
Rick Giganti, Hobbit street, one 39.

273
00:27:05,086 --> 00:27:06,887
Oh, there's, there's a ton of things for us.

274
00:27:06,927 --> 00:27:09,688
Thank God for the local coffee shop.

275
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:11,368
Otherwise I wouldn't have even known about this.

276
00:27:11,968 --> 00:27:12,629
Thank you, Tony.

277
00:27:13,489 --> 00:27:13,589
Um,

278
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:23,264
I'm on the other side of the world on this one because I'm on the other side of main street, but that's going to impact me tremendously, whether it's night or day.

279
00:27:24,165 --> 00:27:34,912
Uh, if you don't know Harvard street, and I'm sure you guys all know, uh, me trying to get out of my driveway at a normal day is a task, let alone trying to do something like this.

280
00:27:35,953 --> 00:27:43,458
Um, if it's at nighttime, I have an issue because I have rental property and I, and unfortunately I've been trying,

281
00:27:44,008 --> 00:27:46,110
very desperately to try to get parking permits.

282
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:53,076
I can't get a parking permit because Harvard street doesn't have parking permits, but where I'm located, they're saying I can park on the street.

283
00:27:53,136 --> 00:27:56,239
Well, no, I can't park on the street, not in front of my house.

284
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:59,222
I can't have a sign that says no parking both sides.

285
00:27:59,882 --> 00:28:05,167
So what we ended up doing with my tenants is they're parking up in front of two 15 on the opposite side.

286
00:28:05,748 --> 00:28:07,029
Now, if they're going to rip up the road,

287
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:08,550
How are we going to park?

288
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:09,310
Where are we going to park?

289
00:28:09,631 --> 00:28:14,712
Can I get a parking permit for these tenants of mine, which are two, two females that work.

290
00:28:15,152 --> 00:28:21,454
One works at, um, Leahy clinic on, on, uh, she's a nurse and she does 12 hour shifts.

291
00:28:21,494 --> 00:28:24,355
So she's getting in at seven and leave it at seven or six.

292
00:28:24,895 --> 00:28:26,235
And sometimes she does overtime.

293
00:28:26,275 --> 00:28:28,756
And then I have another one that works at Raytheon who does overtime.

294
00:28:29,236 --> 00:28:30,757
So I'm going to have an issue with parking.

295
00:28:32,121 --> 00:28:35,184
Great things were mentioned here tonight.

296
00:28:35,924 --> 00:28:40,948
Weather's going to be coming up, four weeks, daytime, nighttime, school buses.

297
00:28:42,069 --> 00:28:46,372
We see it all, never mind just even the fire apparatuses.

298
00:28:47,353 --> 00:28:49,274
That's a major state road.

299
00:28:49,855 --> 00:28:53,678
I was told when I tried to get a sign for just stopping

300
00:28:55,539 --> 00:29:06,524
200 feet or 100 feet from the red line, from the red light in the four corners, so that I could get out of my driveway on a red light, figuring maybe they could stop here on red.

301
00:29:07,244 --> 00:29:12,307
That was against my law and all the laws and rules because it's a state road.

302
00:29:12,987 --> 00:29:16,669
Is this going to be a state-funded project?

303
00:29:17,069 --> 00:29:20,170
Are we gonna get anything, be in Harvard Street, be in the state road?

304
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:21,331
Has that come up?

305
00:29:22,251 --> 00:29:27,177
because that was an issue when I went up against a traffic commission before on Havard Street.

306
00:29:27,237 --> 00:29:31,421
So there's a lot of issues and I'm looking around.

307
00:29:31,922 --> 00:29:37,528
There's not a lot of people here and for Havard Street, you know the traffic on Havard Street and you know the people on Havard Street.

308
00:29:39,062 --> 00:29:45,565
There should be a lot more people up here other than just four or five of us talking, especially with the impact that this is going to have.

309
00:29:46,446 --> 00:29:51,249
School buses alone, it's a big safety issue, and you're coming into holiday season.

310
00:29:52,149 --> 00:30:06,238
So try to push it out a little bit more and get some more people, some more thoughts, but there needs to be some more action for this particular construction to go on.

311
00:30:07,216 --> 00:30:07,516
Thank you.

312
00:30:07,656 --> 00:30:07,997
Thank you.

313
00:30:13,461 --> 00:30:13,921
Good evening.

314
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:15,162
Congratulations everybody.

315
00:30:15,722 --> 00:30:20,226
Um, the concern I have is, you know, what Harvard is a very, very busy street.

316
00:30:21,126 --> 00:30:22,347
There's a lot of traffic every day.

317
00:30:22,367 --> 00:30:24,088
Do we have a plan?

318
00:30:24,108 --> 00:30:31,494
Has anybody seen a plan on what they would do for alternative routes for people to take, you know, regardless of school buses or,

319
00:30:32,619 --> 00:30:37,804
construction trucks with the green line going up, the concrete trucks that you see every day going up there.

320
00:30:39,405 --> 00:30:40,006
It's a concern.

321
00:30:40,406 --> 00:30:41,407
Where's the traffic going to go?

322
00:30:41,447 --> 00:30:48,393
Because right now, Bonner Avenue, tremendously overcrowded in the mornings, in the afternoons.

323
00:30:49,554 --> 00:30:50,975
Golden Avenue, all those areas.

324
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:56,640
And it's going to affect people driving around in the area trying to make it back and forth to work.

325
00:30:57,361 --> 00:31:01,863
get back home, and I just wish that before they started this.

326
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:15,390
First of all, I don't agree with the time frame when they're going to do it, because based on some of the previous work that they've done, it hasn't been broom cleaned and has to be re-repaired.

327
00:31:17,831 --> 00:31:19,052
Winter time is going to be tough.

328
00:31:19,592 --> 00:31:26,796
I mean, I might as well just put sand back in the holes there, because the concrete or whatever they put there, I don't think it's going to make it through the winter season.

329
00:31:27,662 --> 00:31:29,969
The most important thing, I think, is the people that have stores.

330
00:31:32,858 --> 00:31:34,182
This is a busy season for them.

331
00:31:34,222 --> 00:31:34,985
You have the Oasis.

332
00:31:38,885 --> 00:31:45,029
This is when a lot of people make their money because of all the different parties they have for the holiday season and everything.

333
00:31:45,629 --> 00:31:50,271
So, I mean, I don't even know that these people, the store owners, were made aware of this.

334
00:31:50,291 --> 00:31:55,214
The most important thing is, where are you going to get your cannolis for Thanksgiving?

335
00:31:55,294 --> 00:31:57,635
That's what I'm more concerned about, Mr. Theodore.

336
00:31:57,715 --> 00:31:58,436
That's right.

337
00:31:58,676 --> 00:32:01,417
But anyways, I would expect more from National Grid.

338
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:06,839
And I know you guys will do what you have to do to get things squared away.

339
00:32:06,919 --> 00:32:07,299
Thank you.

340
00:32:07,779 --> 00:32:08,579
We appreciate it.

341
00:32:09,199 --> 00:32:15,901
Again, I think this is, we just had a Committee of the Whole meeting with the project being done with Eversource.

342
00:32:16,001 --> 00:32:23,983
And one of the biggest things we talked about is, as we move forward with that before we approve it, is having more of community input and making sure we have community meetings.

343
00:32:24,503 --> 00:32:28,166
So I find this disheartening that this has happened again to this neighborhood.

344
00:32:28,206 --> 00:32:31,709
So, um, I know that you have champions behind this rail.

345
00:32:31,729 --> 00:32:34,031
They're going to make sure that we can do what we can right now.

346
00:32:34,091 --> 00:32:36,433
So, uh, Mr. Vice president, if you can.

347
00:32:36,553 --> 00:32:40,416
Mr. President, if I could, and I want to thank the residents for coming up tonight.

348
00:32:40,436 --> 00:32:45,020
Um, where, where this is a non emergent job.

349
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,502
Um, I know it's dealing with a gas line.

350
00:32:48,123 --> 00:32:53,287
Uh, I think it's crucial that, uh, the city and I'm not going to point the finger at

351
00:32:53,909 --> 00:32:54,930
uh, the utility company.

352
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:59,813
It's the city that represents the residents of this community, not the utility company.

353
00:33:00,293 --> 00:33:03,556
The city should have a clerk of the work assigned to the project.

354
00:33:04,156 --> 00:33:11,921
Residents should be aware of exactly who in the city is the contact person for every project that's taken place in this community.

355
00:33:12,662 --> 00:33:18,446
And, uh, if a traffic plan, as, uh, uh, Mr. D Antonio mentioned, uh, is out there,

356
00:33:19,016 --> 00:33:27,587
Everyone should be aware if they're going to be closing off certain sections, if they're going to be diverting traffic, everyone in that area should be aware, Mr. President.

357
00:33:28,108 --> 00:33:32,233
And I have yet to hear anyone that's aware of anything that's going on with this project.

358
00:33:32,914 --> 00:33:36,959
Also, the fact that it is not an emergency project, to me,

359
00:33:37,489 --> 00:33:42,313
The city should be sitting down with National Grid and talking about mitigation.

360
00:33:42,974 --> 00:33:43,875
What can we do?

361
00:33:44,696 --> 00:33:48,739
You know, we realize lines get older and so forth and need replacement.

362
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,961
I don't think anyone doubts that.

363
00:33:51,562 --> 00:34:00,210
But on behalf of the residents of this community, we should be able to sit down with these utility companies and request certain things, Mr. President.

364
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:07,003
And I know on Harvard, uh, you know, we've talked about broken sidewalks at nauseam, uh, up and down Harvard street.

365
00:34:07,443 --> 00:34:17,050
Wouldn't it be nice to be able to go to the utility company and say, you know what, uh, because of the inconvenience, we would ask that you replace, you know, 30 different sidewalks on Harvard.

366
00:34:17,771 --> 00:34:25,276
Um, you know, to me that that's a no brainer that that should, those discussions should be happening between the city and the utility companies.

367
00:34:25,937 --> 00:34:29,960
And, uh, I think all they're doing is approving things and no follow up.

368
00:34:30,529 --> 00:34:32,510
and we're seeing it time and time again.

369
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:48,177
So I would ask Mr. President in the form of a motion that a clerk of the works be assigned to this project immediately and the residents be notified who in the city is going to be the contact person for this particular project.

370
00:34:48,557 --> 00:35:00,182
The traffic plan be provided also, Mr. President, whether it's on the website so city residents can view it or that the director butters receive a copy of the traffic plan

371
00:35:00,714 --> 00:35:05,535
And also that, going forward, that the city discuss mitigation.

372
00:35:06,136 --> 00:35:17,919
When a project of this size comes in and it's going to be an impact to the community through traffic, through noise, through disruption of everyday quality of life, as was mentioned, you get the holidays coming up.

373
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:29,482
You know, these are the things that we should be using as leverage with the utility companies to get them, Mr. President, to do curb to curb, as we've talked about, restoration,

374
00:35:29,938 --> 00:35:38,510
rather than just restoration in the area where they're digging, new sidewalks, new handicap ramps, improved lighting, whatever it might be.

375
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:41,995
But this is the time to hit up these multi-billion dollar companies.

376
00:35:42,729 --> 00:35:44,391
on behalf of the residents of this community.

377
00:35:44,731 --> 00:35:48,995
So I would offer those three initiatives, Mr. President, in the form of a motion.

378
00:35:49,475 --> 00:35:49,895
Okay.

379
00:35:49,935 --> 00:36:02,526
On the motion, Vice President Mast, that we amend the paper that be forwarded, the mitigation, the Traffic Plan, and the Clerk of the Works.

380
00:36:03,687 --> 00:36:04,628
neighbor communication.

381
00:36:04,668 --> 00:36:08,771
So that's the four pieces I believe that we need to send to the administration.

382
00:36:09,771 --> 00:36:11,072
It's amended.

383
00:36:11,132 --> 00:36:11,453
Okay.

384
00:36:11,473 --> 00:36:14,875
So second, uh, Councilor Knight, all in favor.

385
00:36:15,375 --> 00:36:15,455
Aye.

386
00:36:16,036 --> 00:36:16,616
All opposed.

387
00:36:17,837 --> 00:36:18,497
The ayes have it.

388
00:36:20,839 --> 00:36:21,440
Mr. President.

389
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:24,402
Thank you, Mr. President.

390
00:36:24,442 --> 00:36:32,107
We received the correspondence, um, from the, uh, city solicitor, uh, to Mayor Burke regarding council resolution.

391
00:36:33,137 --> 00:36:34,238
16 dash seven eight three.

392
00:36:34,838 --> 00:36:50,126
Uh, this was a resolution I offered well over a year ago that the city and the city, the city council and their wisdom, uh, asked that, uh, an ordinance be drafted up by the city solicitor who I am very grateful, uh, took the time to draft this up.

393
00:36:50,706 --> 00:36:59,531
Um, I would like to send this particular paper to the subcommittee on business and economic development, uh, just for the edification of the viewing audience.

394
00:37:00,191 --> 00:37:02,132
Uh, this is a consumer protection ordinance.

395
00:37:02,897 --> 00:37:05,759
And if I could just read it briefly, Mr. President, please do.

396
00:37:05,999 --> 00:37:30,276
It says dear mayor Burke and the above caption resolution, the city council requested that the city solicitor draft an ordinance requiring any retail or wholesale business, which is made aware of an incorrect store price that has the ability to communicate with the customer through the offering of a store savings card or other method method be required to refund or credit

397
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:34,183
all customers who purchase an item marked incorrectly.

398
00:37:35,465 --> 00:37:46,796
It goes on to say the code of mass regulations already requires prompt payment be made to customers who have been overcharged and the store owners maintain a price accuracy and missing price report.

399
00:37:47,256 --> 00:37:53,242
This takes it one step further, Mr. President, and I think it really is a consumer-friendly ordinance

400
00:37:53,837 --> 00:37:58,199
And I'm not aware of anyone in this state that has an ordinance like this.

401
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:07,363
But once a store is on notice of an incorrect price, you can go up and talk to the store manager and they'll reimburse you the difference.

402
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:10,324
Some stores will even give you the item for free.

403
00:38:10,985 --> 00:38:13,526
What I'm asking, Mr. President, we take it one step further.

404
00:38:13,886 --> 00:38:16,467
In this day and age with technology and store cards and

405
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:32,076
credit and debit cards and everything else, that store, once they're on notice that a price is incorrectly marked, they should be able to go through that day's worth of receipts and see who else bought that item and maybe wasn't savvy enough to pick up on the incorrect price.

406
00:38:32,636 --> 00:38:44,265
And then they reach out to the customer and either a debit credit, their debit card or their charge card, or send them out, uh, the difference in the meal, Mr. President, um, on the difference,

407
00:38:44,804 --> 00:38:47,004
uh, and price that was incorrectly marked.

408
00:38:47,645 --> 00:39:04,168
Um, Steve, uh, Champoli, who's our, uh, director of seal of weights and measures, uh, reviewed this language and, uh, his, I don't want to quote him, but he said he can't wait to get this enacted so he can start enforcing it, Mr. President.

409
00:39:04,968 --> 00:39:13,130
Um, so I would ask that it be sent to the subcommittee for, uh, its due diligence and vetting and, uh, eventual passage.

410
00:39:13,906 --> 00:39:18,248
of this very important consumer-friendly protection ordinance, Mr. President.

411
00:39:18,268 --> 00:39:18,888
Second, Mr. Chairman.

412
00:39:19,468 --> 00:39:21,149
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

413
00:39:21,369 --> 00:39:23,350
I remember the resolution is very important.

414
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:25,030
Consumers appreciate it.

415
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:33,634
So we're going to, on the motion, seconded by Councilor Dela Russo that this go to subcommittee on economics.

416
00:39:33,874 --> 00:39:34,934
Business and economic development.

417
00:39:34,954 --> 00:39:36,295
Business and economic development.

418
00:39:36,615 --> 00:39:38,356
Name and address for the record.

419
00:39:39,336 --> 00:39:39,576
Thank you.

420
00:39:41,247 --> 00:39:50,251
On that vein of overcharging consumers, I would like to share a story that happened to me.

421
00:39:50,331 --> 00:39:59,255
I bought $20 worth of gasoline a few weeks back in this city at a gas station.

422
00:40:00,676 --> 00:40:02,217
Mathematics, I sort of know.

423
00:40:02,897 --> 00:40:05,078
It was 7.5 gallons.

424
00:40:05,918 --> 00:40:09,400
I thought it should have been 8 gallons because it was exactly

425
00:40:10,543 --> 00:40:12,664
$2.49 and nine-tenths per gallon.

426
00:40:13,164 --> 00:40:16,645
So I'm thinking there should be eight gallons for $20.

427
00:40:17,585 --> 00:40:26,148
And I questioned the attendant who poured the gas into my vehicle, and he says, I just work here, you know.

428
00:40:27,048 --> 00:40:33,370
And so I guess what I'm trying to say is people should probably pay attention at the gas pumps.

429
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:37,971
And I brought gas to the following same station weeks later,

430
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:42,797
And it came out exactly eight gallons at $2.50 a gallon.

431
00:40:43,018 --> 00:40:44,018
So it was corrected.

432
00:40:44,919 --> 00:40:50,003
I'm not sure about the weights and measures, if that was just an abnormality or what.

433
00:40:50,584 --> 00:40:51,545
That's all I wanted to say.

434
00:40:51,665 --> 00:40:52,045
Thank you.

435
00:40:52,065 --> 00:41:03,555
Maybe at the end of the meeting, Mr. Cassin, if you could give us the name of that company that we can actually, not publicly, but ask the weights and measures director, Mr. Champoli, to look into that.

436
00:41:03,595 --> 00:41:06,998
That's what his job is, to make sure those ones

437
00:41:08,056 --> 00:41:09,816
I understand, but I'm a sub-Method graduate.

438
00:41:09,836 --> 00:41:13,237
I don't like to be so-called Mr. Belgian rat.

439
00:41:13,497 --> 00:41:13,957
Leave a note.

440
00:41:14,397 --> 00:41:17,078
But I will keep an eye on that station.

441
00:41:17,098 --> 00:41:17,418
Thank you.

442
00:41:17,618 --> 00:41:17,998
Thank you.

443
00:41:18,118 --> 00:41:29,461
Mr. President, just if I could, just for the education of the viewing audience, Mr. Champoli is responsible for all scales in the community, as well as pumps.

444
00:41:29,961 --> 00:41:35,802
And if you look at any of the gas pumps, it should have a dated sticker on it that shows that it was re-inspected

445
00:41:36,377 --> 00:41:40,740
uh, not only for accuracy, but also the octane level, uh, is checked at the pumps too.

446
00:41:41,201 --> 00:41:44,943
So if you provide that information, uh, we can definitely add that to his list.

447
00:41:45,404 --> 00:41:45,644
Thank you.

448
00:41:45,664 --> 00:41:48,586
They also do the oil trucks and all our cabs too.

449
00:41:48,706 --> 00:41:50,667
So, um, okay.

450
00:41:50,727 --> 00:41:57,272
On that, on that motion seconded by council dollar Russo to, uh, move this paper to subcommittee.

451
00:41:57,777 --> 00:41:59,158
On economic development, all in favor?

452
00:41:59,379 --> 00:41:59,479
Aye.

453
00:42:00,139 --> 00:42:00,680
All opposed?

454
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:01,781
The ayes have it.

455
00:42:02,221 --> 00:42:18,176
If we can go to unfinished business, uh, 17-571, um, to dispose of its common vehicular license, City Bazaar, 466 Main Street, City Council since July 18th.

456
00:42:18,256 --> 00:42:19,096
So it's been tabled.

457
00:42:19,857 --> 00:42:21,899
Um, they're not coming.

458
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:23,941
So we have the motion to, uh,

459
00:42:26,787 --> 00:42:28,268
to receive and place on file.

460
00:42:28,328 --> 00:42:31,849
Okay, on the motion to be seconded by Councilor Knight, all in favor?

461
00:42:32,249 --> 00:42:33,269
All opposed?

462
00:42:33,329 --> 00:42:35,049
The ayes have it.

463
00:42:35,129 --> 00:42:39,531
Next is 17-726, council meeting October 31st, 2017.

464
00:42:39,951 --> 00:42:41,991
Push to eight o'clock, city council October 24th.

465
00:42:42,031 --> 00:42:45,312
Motion to be seconded by Councilor Knight.

466
00:42:45,733 --> 00:42:46,313
All in favor?

467
00:42:46,333 --> 00:42:46,913
All opposed?

468
00:42:47,873 --> 00:42:49,254
And the motion passes.

469
00:42:51,994 --> 00:42:53,855
Yes, Councilor Knight.

470
00:42:56,523 --> 00:42:58,084
report due here.

471
00:42:58,124 --> 00:43:03,986
It looks like the next report for the university accountability ordinance would be due November, Mr. President.

472
00:43:04,026 --> 00:43:10,509
If we could mark that up for a... It's come and gone.

473
00:43:10,529 --> 00:43:16,791
So maybe we can mark that up to make sure that we get a report back from our code enforcement officer to make sure that there have been no complaints filed.

474
00:43:16,991 --> 00:43:18,112
We can, Mr. Clerk.

475
00:43:18,692 --> 00:43:19,953
Okay, thank you.

476
00:43:21,053 --> 00:43:25,355
Next, records were passed to

477
00:43:27,025 --> 00:43:27,666
Who were they passed?

478
00:43:27,706 --> 00:43:28,427
I'm sorry.

479
00:43:28,508 --> 00:43:30,210
I took them from Councilor Moxley.

480
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:31,573
Records were stolen by Councilor Knight.

481
00:43:32,374 --> 00:43:37,022
There were tabled records of meeting October 17th were passed to Councilor.

482
00:43:37,438 --> 00:43:38,039
Mungo Kern.

483
00:43:38,059 --> 00:43:38,719
She's not here.

484
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,921
Records of the meeting, October 31st, 2017.

485
00:43:41,642 --> 00:43:44,284
We'll pass to vice president marks.

486
00:43:44,324 --> 00:43:44,945
How do you find those?

487
00:43:45,405 --> 00:43:46,826
I didn't have a chance to review them.

488
00:43:46,866 --> 00:43:48,688
Mr. President asked that they'd be tabled for one week.

489
00:43:48,708 --> 00:43:49,248
Okay.

490
00:43:49,789 --> 00:43:52,351
On the motion table, those records all in favor.

491
00:43:52,711 --> 00:43:54,393
Opposed guys have it.

492
00:43:54,413 --> 00:43:56,635
So motion motion to adjourn.

493
00:43:56,755 --> 00:43:59,177
Councilor Del Russo seconded.

494
00:43:59,578 --> 00:44:01,399
Councilor Falco all in favor.

495
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:01,779
Aye.

496
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,541
And meeting is adjourned.

497
00:44:39,025 --> 00:44:47,391
On the 10th of March 1985, Mikhail Gorbachev was elected General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union by members of the Politburo.

498
00:44:48,111 --> 00:44:53,575
The reforms he introduced led to a shift in policy in many Soviet satellites, including Poland.

499
00:44:55,296 --> 00:45:00,680
Hundreds of political prisoners with solidarity connections were released in the months after Gorbachev's appointment.

500
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:08,145
But with the Polish economy in free fall, even hardliners like General Kiscak believed that something had to give.

501
00:45:08,587 --> 00:45:13,809
I came to the conclusion that Poland needed radical political reforms.

502
00:45:14,509 --> 00:45:18,491
But for that to happen, the government needed public support.

503
00:45:19,191 --> 00:45:23,173
And no communist government would get that public support.

504
00:45:24,645 --> 00:45:36,071
between Lech Wałęsa, leader of the banned Polish Union Solidarity, Two months later, an historic pact was signed which re-legalized Solidarity

505
00:53:07,874 --> 00:53:08,314
families.

506
00:53:08,415 --> 00:53:13,178
He was very alone, isolated, and he didn't break, he didn't give up.

507
00:53:13,398 --> 00:53:14,419
Many others did.

508
00:53:14,679 --> 00:53:22,924
For that, I believe, we really owe him our support with whatever he's going to take from his political enemies nowadays.

509
00:53:23,565 --> 00:53:29,849
And Jacek, you probably were amongst those who thought, I won't see the end of communism in my lifetime.

510
00:53:29,869 --> 00:53:37,434
I thought it's absolutely clear that we must continue our fight, and I went to my friend's

511
01:01:06,385 --> 01:01:10,187
warned that he might order a nuclear strike wildly out of step with U.S.

512
01:01:10,227 --> 01:01:11,487
national security interests.

513
01:01:12,128 --> 01:01:15,169
Some want legislation to alter the president's nuclear authority.

514
01:01:15,569 --> 01:01:18,330
Others, though, suggested such talk weakened U.S.

515
01:01:18,370 --> 01:01:18,931
deterrence.

516
01:01:19,591 --> 01:01:25,474
The Republican senator who called for the hearing, Bob Corker, said it was about new nuclear scenarios, not about Mr. Trump.

517
01:01:25,874 --> 01:01:28,995
But he has previously warned that the president might be putting the U.S.

518
01:01:29,115 --> 01:01:30,336
on a path to World War III.

519
01:01:31,553 --> 01:01:39,559
More than 48 hours after a powerful earthquake on Iran's border with Iraq, tens of thousands of people are still in desperate need of help.

520
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:50,348
The vast majority of the casualties and the damage were on the Iranian side of the frontier, and survivors there have complained bitterly about the slow pace of the relief effort.

521
01:01:51,990 --> 01:01:53,491
World News from the BBC.

522
01:01:56,078 --> 01:02:04,523
At least four people were killed and a number of children hurt in Northern California when a gunman opened fire in several locations, including a primary school.

523
01:02:05,164 --> 01:02:11,588
The shooting began at a private residence, but the gunman then began randomly firing elsewhere into Hamer County.

524
01:02:12,188 --> 01:02:16,491
The local assistant sheriff, Phil Johnston, told reporters that the suspect was dead.

525
01:02:16,952 --> 01:02:22,195
The suspected shooter is deceased by law enforcement bullets.

526
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:23,636
That's what I'm told.

527
01:02:24,056 --> 01:02:30,644
We are aware that there was a domestic violence incident as reported by neighbors involving the suspected shooter.

528
01:02:30,684 --> 01:02:32,486
We're not releasing his name at this time.

529
01:02:33,688 --> 01:02:40,736
We have recovered suspected used by the shooter a semi-automatic rifle and two handguns.

530
01:02:41,909 --> 01:02:50,692
The Venezuelan government says it has begun repaying interest on its foreign debt after two major credit ratings agencies said the country had partially defaulted.

531
01:02:51,292 --> 01:03:00,755
The communications minister, Jorge Rodriguez, criticised the declaration of what's known as selective default and said Venezuela would continue to honour its commitments.

532
01:03:01,295 --> 01:03:05,857
He said the government is currently renegotiating all its foreign debt, estimated to be $100

533
01:10:35,011 --> 01:10:39,392
And they have voted overwhelmingly yes for marriage equality.

534
01:10:40,313 --> 01:10:42,053
They voted yes for fairness.

535
01:10:43,353 --> 01:10:45,034
They voted yes for commitment.

536
01:10:46,054 --> 01:10:47,815
They voted yes for love.

537
01:10:49,175 --> 01:10:54,817
And now it is up to us, here in the Parliament of Australia, to get on with it.

538
01:10:55,796 --> 01:11:03,348
to get on with the job the Australian people have tasked us to do and get this done this year before Christmas.

539
01:18:33,706 --> 01:18:36,867
think scholars have been thinking about a lot, and this is just coming to light.

540
01:18:37,328 --> 01:18:44,331
And it's one of those things where I don't think a whole lot of people familiar with Zimbabwe are shaking their head thinking, how could this happen?

541
01:18:44,351 --> 01:18:46,252
I think they're saying, of course, this is what's happening.

542
01:18:47,299 --> 01:18:50,141
David, I've got the website open in front of me of the U.S.

543
01:18:50,201 --> 01:18:52,022
Embassy in Zimbabwe.

544
01:18:52,322 --> 01:18:54,584
I'll just quote briefly from a statement from the ambassadors.

545
01:19:09,333 --> 01:19:11,854
minimally staffed and closed to the public.

546
01:19:12,014 --> 01:19:13,654
The statement does continue.

547
01:19:14,454 --> 01:19:18,875
A lot of turbulence clearly to be observed, even from a distance.

548
01:19:19,655 --> 01:19:20,215
Oh, quite right.

549
01:19:20,275 --> 01:19:28,617
And I think, you know, it's difficult times for the people in Zimbabwe and also for, you know, the people who are not indigenous to Zimbabwe.

550
01:19:28,657 --> 01:19:31,158
I mean, all the foreign workers in Zimbabwe.

551
01:19:31,178 --> 01:19:34,778
So I think, you know, it is tough times for them.

552
01:19:34,818 --> 01:19:38,359
And I think what you really need to do is to just sort of keep your head down right now.

553
01:19:38,769 --> 01:20:02,318
and just let the dust settle but ultimately Andy is right you know there is an election coming next year and I think one of the big problems that some of the leaders have in developing countries is that they want to hang on to power I mean if you've done your job just step down and let the next person take over I mean why is it so difficult to do that why do you have to actually sort of hang on to power

554
01:20:02,745 --> 01:20:05,006
Unless, of course, you know, you have something to fear yourself.

555
01:20:05,086 --> 01:20:13,990
I mean, have you done something wrong during your time in power that you need to actually consolidate your power and to make sure that whoever takes over is going to protect you?

556
01:20:14,050 --> 01:20:16,632
I mean, it is just such a ludicrous situation.

557
01:20:17,332 --> 01:20:18,032
OK, thanks both.

558
01:20:18,052 --> 01:20:18,873
We're going to press on.

559
01:20:18,913 --> 01:20:23,635
We've got more straightforwardly business headlines to get through as well here on Business Matters.

560
01:28:00,583 --> 01:28:01,444
Hello, welcome back.

561
01:28:01,764 --> 01:28:03,125
Business Matters continues.

562
01:28:03,165 --> 01:28:05,407
We're going to hear in a minute from the new U.S.

563
01:28:05,468 --> 01:28:06,709
ambassador to Britain.

564
01:28:07,009 --> 01:28:09,431
He's a respected businessman in his own right.

565
01:28:09,812 --> 01:28:13,235
He's a big Republican donor, and he's a friend of the president.

566
01:28:13,595 --> 01:28:18,479
From India, we're going to hear about the latest chapter in the saga of the goods and services tax.

567
01:28:18,860 --> 01:28:19,741
And can it be true?

568
01:28:20,181 --> 01:28:22,103
Are Americans going off soda?

569
01:28:26,667 --> 01:28:28,491
BBC News with Julie Candler.

570
01:28:29,132 --> 01:28:32,258
Loud explosions have been heard in the Zimbabwean capital Hariri.

571
01:36:00,879 --> 01:36:02,940
Three agencies are represented in our embassy.

572
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:05,402
I see how closely they work together.

573
01:36:05,602 --> 01:36:12,486
We've got people embedded, British and our intelligence, and we've got ours and theirs, MI5 and all the intelligence groups.

574
01:36:13,586 --> 01:36:17,188
You can't have a closer relationship that we have, a more trusting relationship.

575
01:36:17,469 --> 01:36:21,611
We focus and concentrate and work hard together with an optimistic attitude.

576
01:36:22,491 --> 01:36:28,235
Ambassador Woody Johnson, who's just presented his credentials to Her Majesty the Queen,

577
01:36:28,975 --> 01:36:30,295
And then he came to talk to the BBC.

578
01:36:30,335 --> 01:36:30,616
Hooray.

579
01:36:30,936 --> 01:36:34,337
Hugh Edwards doing the interview on our behalf there.

580
01:36:34,397 --> 01:36:38,538
So let's pick that up with Andy Euler of Marketplace in Austin, Texas.

581
01:36:38,558 --> 01:36:41,459
David Kwoh is with us from Singapore in the Motley Fool.

582
01:36:42,079 --> 01:36:46,780
And well, I'll tell you what, Andy, I'll start with you, a home question, I guess, with the U.S.

583
01:36:46,840 --> 01:36:47,361
ambassador.

584
01:36:47,661 --> 01:36:48,721
Just give us an overview.

585
01:36:49,081 --> 01:36:54,003
An interesting, a lot of, quite a wide range of questions.

586
01:36:54,263 --> 01:36:55,403
Where would you want to pick up first?

587
01:36:56,331 --> 01:37:04,640
Well, it's one of those things where I think what we've been thinking about a lot and talking about a lot, certainly on Marketplace and also just as business journalists, is regulation.

588
01:37:04,700 --> 01:37:10,847
I think that sort of line of inquiry that the ambassador was talking about and certainly the interviewer was talking about.

589
01:44:40,059 --> 01:44:45,938
You can't turn around and say hey, you know, the American car industry is being disadvantaged in some way.

590
01:44:46,893 --> 01:45:07,117
By by Japanese legislation, it's not it's just the Japanese people don't really want to buy American cars Is it disingenuous though Andy for the ambassador say of course mr. Trump says America first but he really means America first and Trade partners kind of first equal or a really close second.

591
01:45:07,177 --> 01:45:09,638
Otherwise, you're not going to be able to buy our good stuff.

592
01:45:09,658 --> 01:45:09,678
I

593
01:45:10,603 --> 01:45:13,649
That is one of those things that sort of put me back as well.

594
01:45:14,089 --> 01:45:15,712
You know, sort of fair on both sides.

595
01:45:16,614 --> 01:45:19,539
That doesn't seem like, at all, the narrative.
