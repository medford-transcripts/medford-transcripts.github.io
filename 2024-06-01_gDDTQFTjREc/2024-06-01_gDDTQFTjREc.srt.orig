1
00:00:00,349 --> 00:00:03,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so this is the, I guess we can go ahead and start.

2
00:00:03,371 --> 00:00:14,996
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the first meeting of the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee of the Medford City Council.

3
00:00:16,357 --> 00:00:27,963
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't quite remember from the last time if it's procedure to say the Pledge of Allegiance for a committee meeting

4
00:00:33,342 --> 00:00:37,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Chair, you want to, you want me to interrupt?

5
00:00:38,186 --> 00:00:40,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Customarily, there is no pledge of allegiance at a committee meeting.

6
00:00:41,269 --> 00:00:43,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Customarily, but not by requirement.

7
00:00:43,231 --> 00:00:45,493
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a roll call, but again, that's not required.

8
00:00:45,953 --> 00:00:46,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, no.

9
00:00:46,534 --> 00:00:47,855
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just wondering for my own.

10
00:00:48,115 --> 00:00:50,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, clerk, can you call the roll?

11
00:00:50,937 --> 00:00:51,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

12
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:59,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli, who I know is here.

13
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,841
[SPEAKER_03]: I called him first because he's the vice chair, but I felt sorry.

14
00:01:05,901 --> 00:01:06,302
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here.

15
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:07,242
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here.

16
00:01:07,282 --> 00:01:07,962
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, Adam.

17
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:09,242
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

18
00:01:09,282 --> 00:01:09,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Callahan?

19
00:01:10,983 --> 00:01:11,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Present.

20
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:13,924
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Lazaro?

21
00:01:14,424 --> 00:01:14,864
[SPEAKER_05]: Present.

22
00:01:15,624 --> 00:01:16,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Stang?

23
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:17,225
[SPEAKER_03]: Present.

24
00:01:17,985 --> 00:01:18,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Chair Lemming?

25
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:19,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Present.

26
00:01:21,086 --> 00:01:21,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Good to go.

27
00:01:21,526 --> 00:01:21,926
[SPEAKER_03]: You're meeting.

28
00:01:22,527 --> 00:01:22,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

29
00:01:23,707 --> 00:01:24,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

30
00:01:24,287 --> 00:01:30,049
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first thing, the first discussion item is

31
00:01:31,395 --> 00:01:51,080
[SPEAKER_02]: 24-006, a resolution that each council committee review the 2024 to 2025 council governing agenda as amended at the January 24th, 2024 committee of the full meeting.

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,322
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's see, but I know that right now we have

33
00:02:00,713 --> 00:02:02,161
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a bit of limited.

34
00:02:03,559 --> 00:02:11,443
[SPEAKER_02]: time and I'm not seeing not seeing a counselor bears here at the moment to discuss that.

35
00:02:11,563 --> 00:02:17,707
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would propose and again, if this isn't procedurally right, just feel free to correct me.

36
00:02:18,227 --> 00:02:29,933
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just propose that we go to go straight to 24 dash 015 the resolution to discuss modernizing council communications and outreach strategy.

37
00:02:29,953 --> 00:02:29,993
[SPEAKER_02]: Um,

38
00:02:32,887 --> 00:02:36,469
[SPEAKER_02]: which yeah, Councilor Sang.

39
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:49,997
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can, I think the intention of that resolution was just for us to discuss it within our own committee without the Council President or Council Vice President needing to be present.

40
00:02:50,077 --> 00:03:00,963
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to generally talk through timeline and just the kind of specific items in there if there was anything we wanted to prioritize.

41
00:03:01,943 --> 00:03:11,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, yep, then we'll just go to 24-006, Councilor Callahan, see you have your hand raised.

42
00:03:13,029 --> 00:03:25,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, I was just saying if you prefer to do these other two first, we can, because we know the better, then we can have more general discussion after, but then we can just move to move 006 to after those, if you prefer that.

43
00:03:25,815 --> 00:03:29,037
[SPEAKER_05]: But I also am fine if we do the sort of general discussion first.

44
00:03:30,307 --> 00:03:38,736
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're quite similar, too, given how much my presentation will overlap with the items in 24-006.

45
00:03:40,578 --> 00:03:48,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Perhaps we move it to move 006 to the end and we get your stuff, do all of your stuff, and then 006, if there's anything left over in 006, we can cover it at the end.

46
00:03:49,642 --> 00:03:51,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a, so is that a motion to?

47
00:03:51,903 --> 00:03:59,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so motion to suspend the regular rules and move 2406 to the end and go straight to the 24015.

48
00:03:59,568 --> 00:03:59,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.

49
00:03:59,968 --> 00:04:04,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I hear a second?

50
00:04:05,692 --> 00:04:06,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Second.

51
00:04:06,492 --> 00:04:07,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Second from?

52
00:04:08,113 --> 00:04:09,194
[SPEAKER_02]: Scarbelli.

53
00:04:09,394 --> 00:04:10,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, Scarbelli.

54
00:04:11,935 --> 00:04:12,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, all those in favor?

55
00:04:13,677 --> 00:04:13,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

56
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,251
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you have to call.

57
00:04:16,271 --> 00:04:19,854
[SPEAKER_03]: It needs to be a roll call vote.

58
00:04:21,195 --> 00:04:26,899
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to call alphabetically and then by Robert's rules.

59
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:27,960
[SPEAKER_03]: So Councilor Callahan?

60
00:04:28,761 --> 00:04:28,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

61
00:04:30,122 --> 00:04:30,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Lozaro?

62
00:04:31,263 --> 00:04:31,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

63
00:04:33,324 --> 00:04:34,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli?

64
00:04:34,966 --> 00:04:35,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

65
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:37,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Stang?

66
00:04:37,848 --> 00:04:38,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

67
00:04:38,829 --> 00:04:39,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Chair Lemmon?

68
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:40,210
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

69
00:04:41,771 --> 00:04:42,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion is

70
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:49,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Approved on a committee meeting, you don't necessarily have to have to make motions to suspend.

71
00:04:49,325 --> 00:04:51,566
[SPEAKER_03]: You can committee meetings are less formal.

72
00:04:51,586 --> 00:04:55,009
[SPEAKER_03]: You can just jump around the items that you want you want to do in a council meeting.

73
00:04:55,029 --> 00:04:56,470
[SPEAKER_03]: You would have to take votes on all these things.

74
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:00,533
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're in a committee agenda, you can just jump around and go go back and forth.

75
00:05:01,354 --> 00:05:02,194
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

76
00:05:02,334 --> 00:05:03,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

77
00:05:03,275 --> 00:05:04,336
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to save you some time.

78
00:05:06,384 --> 00:05:08,925
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, 24 dash, well, thank you clerk.

79
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:11,367
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, learning experience for all of us.

80
00:05:11,387 --> 00:05:19,714
[SPEAKER_02]: 24-015 resolution to discuss modernizing council communications and outreach strategy.

81
00:05:20,094 --> 00:05:23,236
[SPEAKER_02]: We have any discussion items on that?

82
00:05:24,497 --> 00:05:25,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Sang.

83
00:05:26,769 --> 00:05:27,230
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

84
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:46,523
[SPEAKER_01]: If the committee will indulge me in a short presentation of a lot of the ideas that I had for modernizing our city council communications outreach, I have a short presentation for everyone with some questions for the committee to think about as we talk about these different proposals.

85
00:05:47,143 --> 00:05:50,145
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of them are also already in the governing agenda.

86
00:05:50,165 --> 00:05:51,766
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I said there was an overlap with 24-06.

87
00:05:56,589 --> 00:06:10,513
[SPEAKER_01]: My intention for this meeting is to move forward things that we think we might be ready for as a committee, and to just start discussions on things that we think might need more time, which is probably most of these ideas.

88
00:06:12,253 --> 00:06:16,914
[SPEAKER_01]: With that being said, let me go to the slides.

89
00:06:17,134 --> 00:06:18,055
[SPEAKER_01]: Can folks see them?

90
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:20,926
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

91
00:06:21,827 --> 00:06:26,712
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, okay, so these are just some proposals for our committee to consider.

92
00:06:30,794 --> 00:06:43,586
[SPEAKER_01]: Following what I had in the governing agenda, I put in press releases, short-form videos, social media content, city website updates, input surveys and forums, and meetings with underrepresented groups.

93
00:06:44,006 --> 00:06:50,412
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't meant to be a deep dive into... I know there are some of these that I've talked with

94
00:06:52,475 --> 00:06:57,442
[SPEAKER_01]: individual counselors about that, especially the meetings with other representative groups.

95
00:06:57,662 --> 00:07:06,593
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't to start that process necessarily, but just to talk about and get feedback from this committee about where things are, where we think things are at.

96
00:07:07,234 --> 00:07:10,579
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for us to move in future meetings on it.

97
00:07:11,881 --> 00:07:36,655
[SPEAKER_01]: Going to our first slide, I think the big thing that I was thinking for our committee was that we could create press releases in order to update residents about our work generally, to keep residents informed about opportunities where they can provide feedback on resolutions, ordinances, our work, ahead of big meetings, and in response to our work as well.

98
00:07:38,536 --> 00:07:49,784
[SPEAKER_01]: To keep residents up to date about news in Medford, we know that oftentimes there is a gap between what we know as counselors and what is released out to the public.

99
00:07:50,665 --> 00:07:56,729
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of public information, most of that's not intentional.

100
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:58,811
[SPEAKER_01]: This is to bridge that gap.

101
00:07:59,871 --> 00:08:12,435
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in terms of execution, I think it'd be realistic for our committee to approve monthly updates, essentially monthly summaries of what we've done as a city council in the last month.

102
00:08:13,896 --> 00:08:20,238
[SPEAKER_01]: And so basically the idea is that we would rotate this responsibility among members.

103
00:08:21,374 --> 00:08:29,857
[SPEAKER_01]: Every month, a different one of us would create that summary and bring it to our committee meeting.

104
00:08:29,877 --> 00:08:34,939
[SPEAKER_01]: We would review it quickly together and vote it out to be published.

105
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:41,041
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea behind rotating responsibilities among members is that

106
00:08:41,801 --> 00:08:50,888
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that a lot of us, Councilor Behrs, Councilor Collins, Councilor Leving, me, we've tried at different times to do these regular updates.

107
00:08:51,068 --> 00:08:59,394
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be a lot for a singular councilor to do it repeatedly, regularly across different months.

108
00:08:59,634 --> 00:09:09,541
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the idea is that by dispersing the responsibility, it would be less pressure for us, less of a workload for us.

109
00:09:09,761 --> 00:09:14,248
[SPEAKER_01]: yet still give all of us a chance to write something, all of us a chance to communicate with the public.

110
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:22,280
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think having us bring it to this committee meeting would essentially

111
00:09:23,692 --> 00:09:30,678
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially be like a work responsibility for us to keep us to make sure we're doing this.

112
00:09:31,258 --> 00:09:40,406
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, there are some, I think, questions I had for the committee around the execution of this.

113
00:09:40,967 --> 00:09:50,875
[SPEAKER_01]: So essentially, I think the first big question is, do we do this as a resident services public engagement committee as a complete committee?

114
00:09:51,836 --> 00:10:05,406
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, where each of us are rotating responsibilities, or do we form a special committee, a subcommittee for this that meets at a separate time very quickly, maybe a 30 minute meeting 15 minute 30 minute meeting.

115
00:10:06,887 --> 00:10:08,849
[SPEAKER_01]: I think another question is, I know there are.

116
00:10:10,658 --> 00:10:15,982
[SPEAKER_01]: um, counselors who aren't standing members of this committee who have been working on updates as well.

117
00:10:16,743 --> 00:10:21,727
[SPEAKER_01]: Should we invite them to join our rotating group of counselors?

118
00:10:21,847 --> 00:10:27,472
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think in the same vein of questions, I know that certain counselors are busy at different times of the year.

119
00:10:28,613 --> 00:10:34,777
[SPEAKER_01]: Should we create a system where counselors can pass off their responsibilities to the next counselor or to another counselor?

120
00:10:35,658 --> 00:10:38,483
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then the final questions are around distribution.

121
00:10:38,523 --> 00:10:41,307
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the clerk has an email list for the city council.

122
00:10:42,129 --> 00:10:45,414
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you could use that with the clerk could chime in as well.

123
00:10:45,915 --> 00:10:46,295
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we.

124
00:10:49,062 --> 00:10:56,228
[SPEAKER_01]: Carol Lemming invited Steve Schmierdi, our communications director, to this meeting as well.

125
00:10:56,388 --> 00:11:09,238
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a question about whether we can use the city email list for some of this, for some of these regular press releases, maybe including it as a shorter section in the mayor's regular updates.

126
00:11:11,658 --> 00:11:17,380
[SPEAKER_01]: In order, we also know that the formats in which we reach people have to be accessible as well.

127
00:11:18,321 --> 00:11:23,063
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, for younger folks, social media might be a better way to do that.

128
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:27,305
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a whole section later in this presentation about social media, creating social media.

129
00:11:27,805 --> 00:11:33,087
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that a lot of seniors might not be subscribed to the email list as well.

130
00:11:33,147 --> 00:11:39,450
[SPEAKER_01]: So wondering if we could get a print version to be a shortened print version to be put in the senior center newsletter.

131
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:44,040
[SPEAKER_01]: But with that being said, open to remarks, feedbacks, ideas.

132
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:50,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Saw a hand from Councilor Callahan earlier, but she put it down.

133
00:11:51,602 --> 00:11:59,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, I was just curious if, like, if we have a subcommittee, are only people who are on this committee allowed to be on the subcommittee?

134
00:11:59,265 --> 00:12:01,986
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a question for Adam.

135
00:12:03,506 --> 00:12:05,247
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe that's the case, yes, Councilor.

136
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:06,847
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm curious, yep.

137
00:12:08,248 --> 00:12:09,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scarpelli?

138
00:12:10,752 --> 00:12:11,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, thank you.

139
00:12:11,513 --> 00:12:14,895
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still a little, I'm still a little confused.

140
00:12:14,955 --> 00:12:19,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Justin, if a council saying, as we're looking at this, we're looking to.

141
00:12:19,618 --> 00:12:27,464
[SPEAKER_04]: To an essence, sending out a press release that the city has a whole department that does this.

142
00:12:28,937 --> 00:12:33,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, for one counselor, I'm not afraid to work, but I have two kids in college.

143
00:12:33,258 --> 00:12:34,498
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm working three jobs.

144
00:12:34,818 --> 00:12:54,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, to, uh, it just, to me, it's, it's, uh, you know, and adding another meeting and I, you know, I, I completely, you know, understand what you're looking at, but I still, I'm still a little confused of what, what, you know, the goals of the city council that, um,

145
00:12:55,458 --> 00:13:11,565
[SPEAKER_04]: we're sending out separately now do we have all the the other question I would have is the accessibility issue that who is it getting to is it getting just to the people that you know that that have access to to what we have or you know the mayor does

146
00:13:13,266 --> 00:13:24,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Her monthly video, we have a city communications department that we fund.

147
00:13:26,231 --> 00:13:26,791
[SPEAKER_04]: My question is,

148
00:13:27,757 --> 00:13:30,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we doing, is this too redundant?

149
00:13:30,398 --> 00:13:45,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I think that, um, I don't want to water down messages that it's coming from where, I mean, it's, you know, that's, I have, I have a few concerns with this because I think that, you know, sometimes, sometimes more isn't better.

150
00:13:45,081 --> 00:13:49,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, the city sometimes doesn't do a great job.

151
00:13:50,114 --> 00:13:54,438
[SPEAKER_04]: or really a good job or actually even a decent job getting out information.

152
00:13:54,478 --> 00:14:01,523
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is something where local communities work hand in hand with their communications department.

153
00:14:03,445 --> 00:14:06,948
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you don't, you know, we get

154
00:14:07,811 --> 00:14:19,954
[SPEAKER_04]: We get communications from the city council on a weekly basis through the communications director and the mayor's liaison in Somerville, and that goes out to everybody.

155
00:14:21,534 --> 00:14:30,016
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't want to be redundant, and we don't want to put... Listen, if we put too much out there, sometimes we kind of...

156
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:51,733
[SPEAKER_04]: we kind of bury things that we need, messages we need to send out, and it makes it more difficult for the common citizen, not the person that's there at our meeting every day, not the person that's watching our meetings and chiming in or emailing us all the time, but I think this is something that, you know,

157
00:14:52,694 --> 00:14:58,237
[SPEAKER_04]: If I'm having a difficult time understanding it, I can't imagine our residents.

158
00:14:58,477 --> 00:15:00,658
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's my concern.

159
00:15:00,818 --> 00:15:01,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

160
00:15:02,098 --> 00:15:02,879
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Councillor.

161
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:05,400
[SPEAKER_01]: Chair, let me, if I can respond.

162
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,302
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, respond and then Councillor Zara.

163
00:15:10,374 --> 00:15:28,204
[SPEAKER_01]: um, so I I did think through a lot of those concerns beforehand, um, The intent behind these releases would be to be a compliment basically to the mayors now the way that our comms department is set up in medford Is that it's a really it's really a one-person department falling under the mayor's office.

164
00:15:28,764 --> 00:15:35,528
[SPEAKER_01]: And so oftentimes the publications are more relevant to what the mayor is doing specifically like with

165
00:15:36,641 --> 00:15:43,163
[SPEAKER_01]: Mayor Longo Kern specifically is doing and to do items that are originating from her office.

166
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:57,108
[SPEAKER_01]: Now going forward, we have zoning, we have budgeting, a lot of these bigger processes going forward that are much more council specific rather than mayor specific, and it's currently not in the responsibilities of the comms director.

167
00:15:57,888 --> 00:16:00,490
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, to put out releases that speak to any of that.

168
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:03,851
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we've seen in the last few years, there hasn't been any of it.

169
00:16:04,212 --> 00:16:21,721
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is the idea is that this isn't to, um, bought heads with any city messaging, but this is basically to let residents know when things are coming up and what, when we are working on things, um, separate from what the mayor's office in the city departments are working on.

170
00:16:22,542 --> 00:16:22,642
[SPEAKER_01]: Um,

171
00:16:23,542 --> 00:16:26,785
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can talk about which lists this goes out to.

172
00:16:26,825 --> 00:16:29,267
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we just keep it on the clerk's email list.

173
00:16:29,727 --> 00:16:32,569
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the essence of this is keep it simple.

174
00:16:32,669 --> 00:16:37,713
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, just summarize what we've done and what's coming ahead in terms of meetings that we have.

175
00:16:38,834 --> 00:16:42,137
[SPEAKER_01]: Just things like posting the meeting schedule that we have.

176
00:16:42,337 --> 00:16:48,582
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can coordinate with the president and the vice president of the council to see when these releases go out.

177
00:16:49,858 --> 00:16:56,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Zara, you were next, and then Councilor Scarpelli after, and then Councilor Callahan.

178
00:16:59,428 --> 00:17:00,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

179
00:17:00,929 --> 00:17:05,994
[SPEAKER_06]: I really like the idea of communicating with people.

180
00:17:06,094 --> 00:17:13,742
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we can do it in conjunction with the mayor's office method of communication, not at the same time, but since we are not

181
00:17:14,762 --> 00:17:22,805
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, we don't, we don't do the same thing as the mayor, just like what counselor saying was saying, you know, we're, we're, we're working in tandem, but not doing the same things.

182
00:17:23,106 --> 00:17:30,429
[SPEAKER_06]: So it seems beneficial to me to be able to communicate in sort of a broad, um, generalized.

183
00:17:31,169 --> 00:17:38,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Manner sort of big picture stuff that we're working on what we have going on next, um, seems like based on what.

184
00:17:39,864 --> 00:17:52,341
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems to me like what we're trying to address here isn't, sorry about my cat, what we're trying to address here isn't that we are trying to make up for people, you know,

185
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:56,871
[SPEAKER_06]: trying to over-communicate.

186
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:58,991
[SPEAKER_06]: It's that we don't have a newspaper in town.

187
00:17:59,051 --> 00:18:04,413
[SPEAKER_06]: It's that we're trying to make sure people have a high-level understanding of what we're trying to accomplish.

188
00:18:05,313 --> 00:18:17,417
[SPEAKER_06]: There seems to be maybe a lot of confusion on social media about what we do and how people can access information from us.

189
00:18:17,537 --> 00:18:20,958
[SPEAKER_06]: And we can probably communicate high-level,

190
00:18:22,498 --> 00:18:28,901
[SPEAKER_06]: information to them in a way that's sort of similar to maybe the newsletter that the planning department puts out.

191
00:18:30,162 --> 00:18:34,344
[SPEAKER_06]: They put out information about events related to planning and environment.

192
00:18:34,484 --> 00:18:37,966
[SPEAKER_06]: They put out information that's relevant to the public.

193
00:18:39,146 --> 00:18:41,247
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's high level and it's visually interesting.

194
00:18:42,228 --> 00:18:42,848
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's

195
00:18:43,508 --> 00:18:51,715
[SPEAKER_06]: testament to how their office is able to thoughtfully communicate with their constituents in a way that makes sense.

196
00:18:51,735 --> 00:18:53,216
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we can do like that level.

197
00:18:54,157 --> 00:19:04,185
[SPEAKER_06]: I really like the idea of both communicating on social media and also via the senior center newsletter, maybe just a link in the newsletter that people are already getting or something like that.

198
00:19:05,846 --> 00:19:08,507
[SPEAKER_06]: And rotating who is in charge of it, I also like that idea.

199
00:19:10,268 --> 00:19:26,116
[SPEAKER_06]: Something low key that's not, it doesn't have to go into detail and it doesn't have to editorialize, I think is a really, I think that we can make this happen in a way that says like, you know, this vote was taken, this is what will happen next.

200
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:30,758
[SPEAKER_06]: Simplicity and high level communication.

201
00:19:33,493 --> 00:19:37,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

202
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:38,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

203
00:19:39,216 --> 00:19:43,498
[SPEAKER_04]: And this, this is why these meetings are great, I think, because we can.

204
00:19:44,098 --> 00:19:48,040
[SPEAKER_04]: We can vet some some issues and concerns of my 2 with those comments.

205
00:19:50,191 --> 00:19:59,415
[SPEAKER_04]: I too share those, those concerns, but I think that we have to look at a, trying to find out what that mechanism is going to be.

206
00:19:59,435 --> 00:20:12,121
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, this council is very limited in what we, what, what we control when it, when it comes to, uh, what outlets we can use through the city, unless we have buy-in with the city.

207
00:20:12,861 --> 00:20:14,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, because I, um,

208
00:20:15,842 --> 00:20:24,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Even our page, it's not really understood to most constituents, I think, and where to find information.

209
00:20:24,344 --> 00:20:28,085
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that poses one problem that I think we have to vet out.

210
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:38,127
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I think the other piece is, again, we can use what Councilor Zaro mentioned with the newsletter that she mentioned.

211
00:20:39,307 --> 00:20:41,429
[SPEAKER_04]: it's who gets those newsletters.

212
00:20:42,089 --> 00:20:52,778
[SPEAKER_04]: When we have engaged constituents that are involved in the planning and development, or there's an issue in their neighborhood, they're involved.

213
00:20:53,778 --> 00:20:57,942
[SPEAKER_04]: But like you said, there isn't a main

214
00:20:59,312 --> 00:21:22,817
[SPEAKER_04]: newspaper or or identified uh link that we can use that's going to get out to every resident that's what i'm that's what i'm trying to say when i said that it's is it who who can we reach um you know the the engaged resident they're they're going to see that but what we're seeing is that people that

215
00:21:24,008 --> 00:21:34,650
[SPEAKER_04]: that unfortunately aren't engaged, but when they need to be and they can't, they're not tied in with any group or any, um, um, site that, that we're seeing.

216
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:50,433
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we need to find, you know, work with the city and maybe work with the clerk and our president to see what can we do to start or have that type of messaging that's going to go out throughout the community, not, not specific, um,

217
00:21:51,457 --> 00:21:53,399
[SPEAKER_04]: already engaged constituents.

218
00:21:53,819 --> 00:22:12,013
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think, you know, as we're vetting it, this is great, but I think that these are two concerns that I'm hearing from people that don't know anything until it's already passed because they're not tied into a specific group or newsletter.

219
00:22:12,314 --> 00:22:14,135
[SPEAKER_04]: So just sharing.

220
00:22:15,456 --> 00:22:16,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

221
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:17,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Calhoun.

222
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:19,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

223
00:22:20,097 --> 00:22:35,848
[SPEAKER_05]: So I definitely think it's, I love the idea of having something that is, you know, unbiased, sort of lets people know about what has been passed recently, and especially opportunities for people to get engaged before things are passed.

224
00:22:36,489 --> 00:22:37,950
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the part I'm most excited about.

225
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:38,870
[SPEAKER_05]: I am,

226
00:22:41,232 --> 00:22:53,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Curious if we have talked to the communications department and seen whether we can sort of fold this into what they're doing, like we come up with sort of the brief description.

227
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:55,601
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I don't think it has to be long either.

228
00:22:55,641 --> 00:22:58,283
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're talking, it's simple.

229
00:22:59,824 --> 00:23:05,687
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, I don't know, can you quick answer that before I make a couple more comments?

230
00:23:07,368 --> 00:23:08,469
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that directed to me?

231
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:09,970
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

232
00:23:11,531 --> 00:23:12,292
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

233
00:23:12,752 --> 00:23:13,492
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

234
00:23:14,553 --> 00:23:16,994
[SPEAKER_01]: So to Yeah, it doesn't have to be long.

235
00:23:17,535 --> 00:23:18,015
[SPEAKER_01]: We did.

236
00:23:18,475 --> 00:23:26,720
[SPEAKER_01]: I did ask chair Lemming and I know chair Lemming did reach out to Steve Spirity to come to this meeting.

237
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:37,485
[SPEAKER_01]: We've mentioned some of the some of the ideas that we at least I have mentioned some of the ideas that I'm presenting today to him before and think he seems pretty receptive to a lot of it.

238
00:23:37,505 --> 00:23:37,525
[SPEAKER_01]: I

239
00:23:38,846 --> 00:23:50,348
[SPEAKER_01]: I think to both Councillor Scarpelli's point and to your point, I do think that this is a continuous process where we should try all the avenues that we can think of.

240
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:53,529
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now we have some avenues that are more obvious.

241
00:23:53,589 --> 00:23:55,930
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think we can try with those first.

242
00:23:56,130 --> 00:24:06,472
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, as we continue to meet in these meetings, we can come up with motions to add or subtract this to certain sources or take away from certain sources.

243
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:07,557
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

244
00:24:08,037 --> 00:24:21,655
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to finish up, I'm someone who thinks very deeply and has for seven or eight years thought very deeply about how to engage people who are not currently engaged in city politics.

245
00:24:22,556 --> 00:24:27,358
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not worried that if we send it to some people, there are people who aren't getting it.

246
00:24:27,438 --> 00:24:29,419
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's the way all newsletters are.

247
00:24:29,479 --> 00:24:32,861
[SPEAKER_05]: You start with with the people who you know you can access.

248
00:24:33,721 --> 00:24:36,702
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think this kind of update is

249
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:41,385
[SPEAKER_05]: just trying to get a certain piece of information out.

250
00:24:41,725 --> 00:24:46,508
[SPEAKER_05]: The question of how do you engage more people, I think, is something that we reach differently.

251
00:24:46,708 --> 00:24:47,989
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not what we discuss now.

252
00:24:48,289 --> 00:24:56,174
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what we discussed specifically when we were discussing, hey, how do we reach those people and bring them into any of these discussions?

253
00:24:57,435 --> 00:25:01,298
[SPEAKER_05]: To me, that's what the meetings with underrepresented groups is really

254
00:25:01,838 --> 00:25:05,559
[SPEAKER_05]: dedicated to as well as the community liaisons and other things.

255
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:11,142
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not, I'm not really concerned about, you know, having a newsletter that does not go to every single person in the city.

256
00:25:11,162 --> 00:25:13,142
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you start, you know, that's how newsletters are, right?

257
00:25:13,202 --> 00:25:14,643
[SPEAKER_05]: You start with what you can.

258
00:25:15,663 --> 00:25:25,587
[SPEAKER_05]: I just, I would love it if we can also talk to the communications department and see if that's one of the avenues that, you know, we can sort of fold this into if it's something nice and simple.

259
00:25:26,027 --> 00:25:26,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

260
00:25:28,857 --> 00:25:31,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scarbell, I wasn't sure if you had another comment to raise your hand.

261
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:33,610
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

262
00:25:34,711 --> 00:25:42,174
[SPEAKER_04]: I think when we're thinking of being accessible, I think, sure, you start at, we need a starting point.

263
00:25:42,194 --> 00:25:42,834
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree with you.

264
00:25:43,334 --> 00:25:56,420
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, don't we want the mechanisms in place that we are going to reach everyone, everyone that we can and making sure that we're getting it to the families and the residents that don't have access.

265
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:57,500
[SPEAKER_04]: So I,

266
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:04,961
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't, when we try, we want to do this because it's something that's very important, it's needed.

267
00:26:05,001 --> 00:26:05,462
[SPEAKER_04]: We know that.

268
00:26:05,982 --> 00:26:18,765
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that we need a partner in the city that's going to sit with us and hold our hands and walk us through the processes so we can make sure that we're making sure we're reaching everybody.

269
00:26:19,445 --> 00:26:33,514
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it'll be a disservice, truthfully, because of what we're hearing and how divided our community is right now, and the haves and the have-nots that they say the city council has now a newsletter.

270
00:26:34,014 --> 00:26:34,975
[SPEAKER_04]: And who is it reaching?

271
00:26:35,295 --> 00:26:36,576
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's reaching to the haves.

272
00:26:37,296 --> 00:26:39,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, why isn't it reaching the have-nots?

273
00:26:39,057 --> 00:26:42,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we haven't vetted out properly how to get it to those avenues.

274
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:50,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, it could be a simple, it could be a simple resolution, but everybody in this meeting doesn't have, we don't have control of that.

275
00:26:50,762 --> 00:26:51,542
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what I'm saying.

276
00:26:51,582 --> 00:27:01,487
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that, you know, I appreciate a chairperson reaching out to Mr. Smerdy, but, and I understand that the mayor has their own message, but

277
00:27:02,532 --> 00:27:05,074
[SPEAKER_04]: We're the city council for the city in Medford.

278
00:27:05,534 --> 00:27:10,177
[SPEAKER_04]: That is the department that has to work for us to make sure that our message gets out.

279
00:27:10,657 --> 00:27:28,189
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not saying put our message in with the mayor's, but having the avenues in place that it's reaching everybody that we can conceivably reach so there aren't concerns or questions or people that are divided against saying, here we go again.

280
00:27:28,809 --> 00:27:30,730
[SPEAKER_04]: How many times have we heard this?

281
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,071
[SPEAKER_04]: People in West Medford know about it.

282
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:35,852
[SPEAKER_04]: How come the people at Middlesex Ave don't know about it?

283
00:27:36,853 --> 00:27:37,913
[SPEAKER_04]: We hear this every day.

284
00:27:38,533 --> 00:27:40,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, at least I have for the last 16 years.

285
00:27:41,135 --> 00:27:45,116
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just don't want to add another layer until we vet the process out.

286
00:27:46,577 --> 00:28:05,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds great, and I appreciate it just for the fact that I can't tell you, I'm sure we all have heard, the lack of a local newspaper has absolutely crippled our community for getting information and really sharing and celebrating some really big news in our community.

287
00:28:05,662 --> 00:28:15,784
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, I think that, you know, as we move forward with these meetings, I think it's imperative that we meet with the city representatives that are going to sit with us and say, hey,

288
00:28:16,664 --> 00:28:24,230
[SPEAKER_04]: We might not hit every group, but we did everything we possibly could to reach these the the underprivileged groups.

289
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:31,955
[SPEAKER_04]: And the message is getting out to everybody, at least with an effort that was that was put forth by this council.

290
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:34,837
[SPEAKER_04]: Not at least that's how I feel.

291
00:28:34,877 --> 00:28:36,278
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, thank you.

292
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:38,470
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you.

293
00:28:39,131 --> 00:28:40,692
[SPEAKER_02]: I would, I see two more hands.

294
00:28:40,792 --> 00:29:02,311
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to let Councillor Sang finish his presentation because this, I think there, I believe there are a few more slides and leave enough time because we have, we have another, just another half an hour before we have a very strict cutoff to this meeting prior to that.

295
00:29:02,351 --> 00:29:03,572
[SPEAKER_02]: And also get enough time.

296
00:29:05,185 --> 00:29:05,745
[SPEAKER_01]: Councilor Lemming.

297
00:29:06,726 --> 00:29:16,993
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I'm, I'm happy to, if we don't get to the other things on this PowerPoint, I'm happy to send this around to other members via the clerk.

298
00:29:18,034 --> 00:29:21,576
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm, I would also, I can make a motion right now.

299
00:29:23,617 --> 00:29:38,204
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'd like to motion to get feedback from the communications director on the ideas in this, um, in this PowerPoint, uh, before our next meeting, our next standing meeting.

300
00:29:39,224 --> 00:29:40,765
[SPEAKER_01]: I would send that.

301
00:29:40,785 --> 00:29:41,265
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

302
00:29:42,165 --> 00:29:44,666
[SPEAKER_02]: And a second from Councilor Scarapelli.

303
00:29:44,746 --> 00:29:45,847
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

304
00:29:46,607 --> 00:29:46,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

305
00:29:47,328 --> 00:29:48,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we have to do a roll call.

306
00:29:48,668 --> 00:29:50,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, roll call.

307
00:29:53,385 --> 00:29:55,406
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll make a default on you tonight, Matt.

308
00:29:56,846 --> 00:29:58,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, this is a learning experience.

309
00:29:58,846 --> 00:30:03,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of these votes are roll call, some of these- Listen, I've been doing this, I've been doing this 16 years, I still butcher it.

310
00:30:06,508 --> 00:30:12,590
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have- I'm ready whenever you are.

311
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:15,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Ready.

312
00:30:17,491 --> 00:30:18,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Callahan.

313
00:30:18,711 --> 00:30:18,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

314
00:30:19,732 --> 00:30:20,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Lozano.

315
00:30:21,112 --> 00:30:21,332
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

316
00:30:22,517 --> 00:30:23,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli?

317
00:30:24,098 --> 00:30:24,378
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

318
00:30:25,079 --> 00:30:25,779
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Stang?

319
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:26,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

320
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:27,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Chair Lemming?

321
00:30:28,521 --> 00:30:28,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

322
00:30:30,322 --> 00:30:42,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes and let's go to Councilor Lozaro and then let Councilor Sang finish his presentation.

323
00:30:44,512 --> 00:30:48,415
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, Councilor Lozaro.

324
00:30:52,902 --> 00:31:15,876
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to say, after what Councillor Scarpelli mentioned, that it seemed like a good moment to mention that it sort of felt like a good bridge to the discussion of the diversity, equity, and inclusion conversation we were going to maybe get to at some point during this meeting, maybe today.

325
00:31:16,797 --> 00:31:20,019
[SPEAKER_06]: But because if what we wanted

326
00:31:22,231 --> 00:31:39,095
[SPEAKER_06]: With the understanding that not letting perfect be the enemy of good, that if we want to make sure that we're reaching everybody, even when there was a newspaper, that would have been maybe a barrier, that it would only be people that were subscribing to a newspaper that were able to access that information.

327
00:31:39,135 --> 00:31:44,957
[SPEAKER_06]: So there would never be a situation where literally everybody would have access to information at the same level.

328
00:31:45,097 --> 00:31:48,378
[SPEAKER_06]: But that being said, I think we would be able to address

329
00:31:49,958 --> 00:31:58,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, the possibility that, uh, you know, maybe Francis would be able to tell us, like, how are people getting information?

330
00:31:58,143 --> 00:31:59,604
[SPEAKER_06]: How are people best accessing?

331
00:32:02,893 --> 00:32:13,599
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, public information about how they can, you know, find out what's happening in City Hall and how can we best access the people that need to hear about it.

332
00:32:13,879 --> 00:32:20,743
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, that's, there are resources that we have access to in the city that we can utilize for those purposes.

333
00:32:20,823 --> 00:32:25,245
[SPEAKER_06]: And maybe that can be a step one before we get into the newsletter.

334
00:32:26,686 --> 00:32:27,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a thought.

335
00:32:28,306 --> 00:32:30,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Sang, how fast can you

336
00:32:32,051 --> 00:32:32,391
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll stop.

337
00:32:32,551 --> 00:32:34,492
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll stop.

338
00:32:34,532 --> 00:32:39,033
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's realistic to get through all of them today, but we can we can do some pretty quickly.

339
00:32:39,213 --> 00:32:48,735
[SPEAKER_01]: And President Bares has reminded me that this meeting can run long and the next meeting can start late as well.

340
00:32:49,055 --> 00:32:50,396
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think we can

341
00:32:52,122 --> 00:32:53,083
[SPEAKER_01]: have a cutoff point.

342
00:32:53,183 --> 00:33:06,212
[SPEAKER_01]: I think generally hearing back from this, well, I'll either chair Lemming or I, we can coordinate on getting feedback from Steve and it sounds like we, it might not be

343
00:33:07,847 --> 00:33:11,188
[SPEAKER_01]: favorable to do a special subcommittee for this, because it adds meetings.

344
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:20,272
[SPEAKER_01]: We can also just have a sign up list of counselors who are interested in doing it, because every counselor is, you know, we have different family situations, different job situations as well.

345
00:33:20,953 --> 00:33:28,736
[SPEAKER_01]: And so perhaps it makes more sense to have a list of counselors who want to take on this responsibility.

346
00:33:30,052 --> 00:33:31,794
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm moving on to the next slide.

347
00:33:32,755 --> 00:33:38,861
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so short form videos, this is basically just a summary of those of the monthly updates.

348
00:33:40,402 --> 00:33:42,104
[SPEAKER_01]: My idea for it is basically just

349
00:33:43,134 --> 00:33:44,235
[SPEAKER_01]: keep it very simple.

350
00:33:45,696 --> 00:33:48,017
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't editorialize, just tell people what we did.

351
00:33:48,858 --> 00:33:54,521
[SPEAKER_01]: And then to post these wherever we can, basically, I think we need to determine what that looks like.

352
00:33:55,642 --> 00:34:09,831
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I wanted to make sure that we got to this slide when while Kevin was still in the room, because I was wondering what the possibility of partnering with Medford Community Media would be like on this.

353
00:34:15,251 --> 00:34:17,756
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, would you like me to speak to that really?

354
00:34:18,136 --> 00:34:18,858
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be great.

355
00:34:18,878 --> 00:34:19,338
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be great.

356
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,260
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

357
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:27,452
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so just at least for like, from like a nuts and bolts perspective, um, you know,

358
00:34:28,655 --> 00:34:33,137
[SPEAKER_00]: Medford community media is, you know, membership is open to Medford residents, right?

359
00:34:33,457 --> 00:34:44,562
[SPEAKER_00]: And so provided that, you know, any, any and all counselors are Medford residents, you are just as welcome as anyone else to, uh, to apply for membership.

360
00:34:45,242 --> 00:34:50,904
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, the only requirements are filling out some paperwork, uh, submitting for a Corey is the, is the big one.

361
00:34:51,765 --> 00:34:51,865
[SPEAKER_00]: Um,

362
00:34:53,217 --> 00:34:58,040
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so you would be able to and any of you would be able to create a membership.

363
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:08,786
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, within available hours, you know, get trained up on equipment, use the studio space, take out cameras, microphones, that kind of thing.

364
00:35:09,546 --> 00:35:17,570
[SPEAKER_00]: You also some people, you know, kind of produce their own stuff with their own equipment on their own time, and then just give it to us.

365
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:19,992
[SPEAKER_00]: So often, as an example,

366
00:35:20,552 --> 00:35:29,237
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the mayor's office will record a short video and they'll just be like, here's the video file, um, you know, to be put, to be put on the channels.

367
00:35:30,078 --> 00:35:45,227
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so yeah, like, I mean, it would be pretty, pretty wide open, um, for that to, to sort of also add some clarity, you know, in terms of our role in it, you know, we, uh, the MCM staff is essentially in a,

368
00:35:46,969 --> 00:35:54,363
[SPEAKER_00]: We are essentially providing the services, we're providing the availability of equipment, assisting and troubleshooting, right?

369
00:35:55,385 --> 00:35:59,767
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not really meant to be a production company per se.

370
00:36:01,048 --> 00:36:05,730
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there are plenty of things we do around the city in terms of city events.

371
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:22,037
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you folks want to do some kind of a weekly, monthly video thing, our role would be training you up on the equipment, helping you out if you run into any snags, scheduling time if you want to do studio time, that kind of a thing.

372
00:36:23,817 --> 00:36:31,619
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, so I want to keep that brief but that's essentially, you know, what it would look like from just a kind of practical standpoint.

373
00:36:33,319 --> 00:36:33,979
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.

374
00:36:34,479 --> 00:36:35,160
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very helpful.

375
00:36:41,301 --> 00:36:46,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any answer saying is there any, any other presentation you'd like to make on this.

376
00:36:47,953 --> 00:36:48,834
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, not really.

377
00:36:48,854 --> 00:37:06,666
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think the other question I had in terms of short form videos was, I know there, um, some counselors who want to get publicity back, uh, like, or just basically publicize some of the projects that they want to work on and get feedback ahead of introducing it to the council or working on it in committee.

378
00:37:07,166 --> 00:37:13,010
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like, um, we can separate that from the idea of just doing general monthly summaries.

379
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:16,692
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe that's something that individual counselors can take up on their own time.

380
00:37:20,455 --> 00:37:21,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scarpelli.

381
00:37:23,136 --> 00:37:24,056
[SPEAKER_04]: That brings a good point.

382
00:37:24,137 --> 00:37:44,083
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that community channels, it's a little bit different, but I believe we can, to this point where we have a big issue or a big meeting coming up or needing to send a message, that we can add it to the loop.

383
00:37:46,257 --> 00:37:54,664
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if we wrote something up and sent it to communications, could that be added to the loop on the public access that because in the past we used to do that.

384
00:37:54,684 --> 00:37:59,848
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilor saying if I may.

385
00:38:02,792 --> 00:38:03,833
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Councilor Lemming, you should.

386
00:38:04,354 --> 00:38:04,794
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sorry.

387
00:38:04,914 --> 00:38:05,595
[SPEAKER_00]: Apologies.

388
00:38:05,755 --> 00:38:06,295
[SPEAKER_00]: Apologies.

389
00:38:07,517 --> 00:38:09,098
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also new to the procedures.

390
00:38:10,359 --> 00:38:22,470
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, so to answer you, Councilor Scarpelli, yeah, you know, I can even, I can send an email to all of y'all with the specifications, but pretty much any image file.

391
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:26,953
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then, you know, that you want to have on that digital bulletin board.

392
00:38:27,433 --> 00:38:31,976
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have a timeframe of when you want it to be, you know, date wise, send those along.

393
00:38:32,276 --> 00:38:41,021
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's worth mentioning, even though it won't come up as long as it meets like the, the, the kind of acceptability standards for, for broadcasting.

394
00:38:41,061 --> 00:38:41,222
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

395
00:38:41,522 --> 00:38:46,005
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you don't have anything lewd or lascivious on the notice, it's going to go up.

396
00:38:46,125 --> 00:38:46,365
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

397
00:38:46,925 --> 00:38:48,506
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so that's definitely available.

398
00:38:48,546 --> 00:38:49,347
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there was.

399
00:38:49,987 --> 00:39:07,178
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had a one to two or even three like slide kind of presentation that was just like very punchy and telling you, telling folks what's coming up and you want to send me a series of three images, I can put those three in line, uh, on our digital bulletin board and you're good to go.

400
00:39:07,198 --> 00:39:09,339
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that, that's, that's great.

401
00:39:09,379 --> 00:39:10,580
[SPEAKER_04]: So that might help.

402
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:17,104
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we, we can chip away at this, uh, council chair, uh, lemon.

403
00:39:17,284 --> 00:39:18,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me see what we can do.

404
00:39:20,643 --> 00:39:22,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

405
00:39:23,464 --> 00:39:27,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any further discussions or motions on the topic?

406
00:39:30,346 --> 00:39:40,589
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well, I suppose since we have about, technically about, well, 19 minutes left, I'd like to open this up for, is there any public comment?

407
00:39:40,609 --> 00:39:46,531
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I don't see anybody.

408
00:39:47,927 --> 00:40:05,298
[SPEAKER_02]: They're hand raised, so let's move on to 24-022 offered by Councillor Zaro resolution on biannual training on diversity, equity and inclusion.

409
00:40:07,419 --> 00:40:10,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any discussion on this topic?

410
00:40:14,425 --> 00:40:22,010
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd love to just open this up for the committee to discuss possibilities.

411
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:26,312
[SPEAKER_06]: I spoke with our diversity, equity and inclusion.

412
00:40:26,332 --> 00:40:28,394
[SPEAKER_06]: My God, my I'm so sorry.

413
00:40:30,475 --> 00:40:34,797
[SPEAKER_06]: Our diversity, equity and inclusion director a few times and.

414
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:45,586
[SPEAKER_06]: she and I are both really excited about the prospect of talking about it as a council.

415
00:40:46,547 --> 00:40:54,775
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing I have thoughts and concerns about is how to do it with the knowledge that we are subject to open meeting law.

416
00:40:55,696 --> 00:41:01,562
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe there's possibility that we could do it either in smaller groups or

417
00:41:03,224 --> 00:41:05,870
[SPEAKER_06]: Online or with.

418
00:41:07,112 --> 00:41:11,300
[SPEAKER_06]: Council president, I know we don't have a city solicitor, but maybe we could do it with.

419
00:41:11,863 --> 00:41:14,024
[SPEAKER_06]: somebody from KP Law or just like an advisor.

420
00:41:14,044 --> 00:41:20,406
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't want to do it if it would cost us additional funds to like, you know, contract out.

421
00:41:21,626 --> 00:41:31,970
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do think that it would be really beneficial for us to utilize Director Nwaje because she is such a wonderful resource for us in the city.

422
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:41,173
[SPEAKER_06]: And because so much of our work has to do with the way that we relate to the people of Medford and the way that we interact with the public.

423
00:41:41,853 --> 00:41:49,322
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so, uh, I'd love to hear thoughts and feedback from the other, um, counselors and, um.

424
00:41:51,144 --> 00:41:52,826
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's that's that's where I'm at.

425
00:41:57,611 --> 00:41:57,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Um.

426
00:42:00,937 --> 00:42:01,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

427
00:42:02,177 --> 00:42:19,801
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is something that I found when I first started having our first meeting with the school committee, the Massachusetts School Committee Association, and giving us like a tutorial.

428
00:42:19,881 --> 00:42:20,661
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was great.

429
00:42:21,182 --> 00:42:21,982
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that when

430
00:42:23,527 --> 00:42:47,122
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, when, uh, when Mark Rumley was our city solicitor, he would often bring us in individually and give us a, uh, you know, checks and balances the way of the world and legal and, um, and, uh, common, common practices of city counselors, little course, but I don't know, maybe the clerk can help me with this.

431
00:42:47,142 --> 00:42:50,204
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can ask, um, legal about this.

432
00:42:50,384 --> 00:42:51,945
[SPEAKER_04]: If we had a, um,

433
00:42:52,665 --> 00:43:15,419
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the word I'm looking for that we had, um, you know, uh, I'm, I'm, I'm drawing a blank, but it's, we would get together and have a, um, like a meeting together, like a learning, um, seminar where it really didn't affect the open meeting law because we called it, um,

434
00:43:16,883 --> 00:43:17,905
[SPEAKER_04]: a certain gathering.

435
00:43:18,727 --> 00:43:19,990
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm having a brain freeze, Adam.

436
00:43:20,251 --> 00:43:21,934
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a training session might be...

437
00:43:24,204 --> 00:43:48,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Might be exempt you just you would still not be able to deliberate you would still not you know, I mean there would be um But and you wouldn't be able to discuss any pending council business or anything like that, but I think training sessions you can do so if we did that if we brought in our our staff from the city that can come in the diversity staff that comes in and present us with a presentation as a group

438
00:43:49,272 --> 00:44:09,201
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we can share, you know, we can, um, you know, separate the two groups with them and then even share some issues, but then not discuss them until, you know, maybe, uh, a committee of the whole meeting to describe, um, diversity inclusion subcommittee or committee of the whole.

439
00:44:09,322 --> 00:44:11,963
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's gotta be a way that we can do this, that, that.

440
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:19,027
[SPEAKER_04]: that I know when we were in the school committee, we used to have training together and it wouldn't affect us.

441
00:44:19,167 --> 00:44:21,768
[SPEAKER_04]: So, because I think this is a good idea.

442
00:44:21,808 --> 00:44:28,832
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that anything will help and make sure that we stay on track of what we're trying to deliver here in Medford, so.

443
00:44:31,774 --> 00:44:33,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Councillor Zara.

444
00:44:34,806 --> 00:44:43,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, so my understanding of open meeting laws is if you're not discussing what's on an agenda, then you're not subject to open meeting laws.

445
00:44:43,711 --> 00:44:56,057
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess the only thing would be if somebody can monitor it and kind of keep you off the agenda, then you'd be OK, right?

446
00:44:56,097 --> 00:44:59,198
[SPEAKER_06]: That's probably, if you do a very specific training,

447
00:45:01,059 --> 00:45:07,516
[SPEAKER_06]: then it doesn't have to touch anything that's pertinent to an agenda for that term.

448
00:45:11,129 --> 00:45:12,369
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a question, actually.

449
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:16,471
[SPEAKER_06]: You get to talk any time, I think, because you're the chair.

450
00:45:17,091 --> 00:45:17,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, great.

451
00:45:18,971 --> 00:45:29,714
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, do you think that these trainings would involve people talking at the counselors or would involve more in-depth discussions?

452
00:45:29,874 --> 00:45:34,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, I mean, my understanding is that it's essentially an informational session.

453
00:45:34,575 --> 00:45:37,556
[SPEAKER_02]: What would the format look like in that sense?

454
00:45:44,828 --> 00:45:47,249
[SPEAKER_02]: Councillor Lazaro.

455
00:45:47,669 --> 00:45:51,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, my internet connection is unstable.

456
00:45:51,891 --> 00:45:57,474
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you say, are the training sessions people talking at the council, or is it interaction?

457
00:45:58,034 --> 00:46:10,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I just wanted to kind of get a sense of how much interaction, just like inner discussion among the councillors there would be, or if it's more of an information sort of thing.

458
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:12,421
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that they would all,

459
00:46:13,539 --> 00:46:22,188
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that probably what it would be would be different depending on what the topic is and what Director Nwaje would be bringing to the table.

460
00:46:24,350 --> 00:46:34,580
[SPEAKER_06]: Based on my conversation with her, we were talking about different topics that would be pertinent to the time period that we would be having it.

461
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:35,581
[SPEAKER_06]: So it could be

462
00:46:38,666 --> 00:46:50,159
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, every year there's something that kind of comes up, maybe something that's an issue that's prominent in in Medford, particularly during that time, maybe something that might have happened in town.

463
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:51,821
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it would be.

464
00:46:53,164 --> 00:46:53,905
[SPEAKER_06]: really variable.

465
00:46:55,567 --> 00:47:11,162
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think we could speak with her, or if she would be hiring somebody that would be coming in as like a like a special kind of training, it might be there's so many different ways to look at diversity, it could be disability, it could be, you know, mental illness, it could be like,

466
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:37,499
[SPEAKER_06]: uh income diversity and it could be racial so there's there's or or sexuality or gender there's like a lot of different stuff that you would be doing and it could be like informational or it could be sort of like uh going through like um uh role playing so i i'm not sure i think there are a lot of different ways that it could be done okay thank you is there any public comment

467
00:47:44,206 --> 00:47:47,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry, I didn't see the cameras.

468
00:47:48,607 --> 00:47:49,107
[SPEAKER_02]: No worries.

469
00:47:49,407 --> 00:47:51,248
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm so sorry.

470
00:47:52,068 --> 00:47:56,449
[SPEAKER_02]: The little leaves in the corner were camouflaging your hand.

471
00:47:57,289 --> 00:47:58,950
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't log on to my Zoom account.

472
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:02,591
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the only background that's on this Zoom account.

473
00:48:02,691 --> 00:48:06,112
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm like, it's awful.

474
00:48:06,412 --> 00:48:08,272
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to use a different background most days.

475
00:48:11,813 --> 00:48:33,552
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess my comment was I was wondering if we could invite Frances to one of our meetings to talk about what she thinks would be best for a training like this and what this might look like if, again, like I talked about during the regular meeting, she mentioned to me possibly

476
00:48:34,813 --> 00:48:38,334
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing some commissions in to do this training with us as well.

477
00:48:38,834 --> 00:48:43,635
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think it would be helpful if we were to meet with her to talk about this a bit more.

478
00:48:44,835 --> 00:48:57,857
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you wouldn't mind Councilor Lazaro, I'd like to make that in a form of a motion to invite Director Nwaje to come to our next meeting to talk about this.

479
00:48:58,797 --> 00:48:59,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a second?

480
00:49:00,297 --> 00:49:00,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Second.

481
00:49:01,958 --> 00:49:02,238
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

482
00:49:02,498 --> 00:49:03,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Clerk, please call the roll.

483
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:05,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's the second?

484
00:49:06,501 --> 00:49:07,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Emily.

485
00:49:07,542 --> 00:49:07,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor.

486
00:49:07,922 --> 00:49:08,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

487
00:49:08,963 --> 00:49:09,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

488
00:49:11,345 --> 00:49:11,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Hang on a second.

489
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:18,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Second the motion.

490
00:49:19,091 --> 00:49:20,192
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm seconding the motion.

491
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:22,514
[SPEAKER_03]: I got it.

492
00:49:22,654 --> 00:49:23,014
[SPEAKER_03]: I got it.

493
00:49:23,154 --> 00:49:24,616
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, I just, I'm just still typing.

494
00:49:25,536 --> 00:49:27,898
[SPEAKER_02]: I was, I was pointing out the pun.

495
00:49:33,905 --> 00:49:34,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Here comes the roll call.

496
00:49:36,826 --> 00:49:37,686
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Callaghan.

497
00:49:38,706 --> 00:49:38,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

498
00:49:39,966 --> 00:49:40,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Lozaro.

499
00:49:41,506 --> 00:49:41,786
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

500
00:49:42,987 --> 00:49:43,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli.

501
00:49:44,547 --> 00:49:44,847
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

502
00:49:45,507 --> 00:49:46,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Stang.

503
00:49:46,567 --> 00:49:46,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

504
00:49:47,407 --> 00:49:47,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Chair Lemmon.

505
00:49:48,808 --> 00:49:49,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

506
00:49:49,748 --> 00:49:50,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

507
00:49:52,668 --> 00:49:53,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Once again, okay.

508
00:49:54,448 --> 00:49:56,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any public comment?

509
00:49:58,429 --> 00:50:03,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, seeing none, motion to, oh, I freeze this.

510
00:50:04,807 --> 00:50:07,049
[SPEAKER_02]: reinstate the rules of order and go back to 24-006.

511
00:50:07,069 --> 00:50:13,594
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need to vote on that because it's a committee meeting.

512
00:50:13,634 --> 00:50:14,755
[SPEAKER_03]: You can just jump back and forth.

513
00:50:15,075 --> 00:50:16,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, got it.

514
00:50:16,797 --> 00:50:19,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, I don't think you can make motions, Councilor.

515
00:50:19,779 --> 00:50:20,099
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I?

516
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:24,443
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well, it's my first meeting, everybody.

517
00:50:24,683 --> 00:50:27,285
[SPEAKER_02]: You're doing great.

518
00:50:27,405 --> 00:50:32,870
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm asking for your flexibility here as I try to wrap everything up in about,

519
00:50:34,168 --> 00:50:36,549
[SPEAKER_02]: about eight more minutes.

520
00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:53,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so is there, okay, 24-006 resolution that each council committee review the 2024 to 2025 council governing agenda as amended at the January 24th, 2024 committee of the full meeting.

521
00:50:53,918 --> 00:50:56,159
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any discussion on this?

522
00:51:06,172 --> 00:51:06,993
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Sang.

523
00:51:07,693 --> 00:51:09,514
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

524
00:51:09,994 --> 00:51:12,236
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is pretty straightforward.

525
00:51:12,436 --> 00:51:33,126
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what the other committees have just been doing is basically going through the items that have been assigned to them and basically seeing, I guess, like maybe seeing if there will be lead counselors that want to take up certain projects or whether we want to adjust the timelines that we see in the doc.

526
00:51:35,891 --> 00:51:38,813
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's a good place to start, I'm open.

527
00:51:39,574 --> 00:51:46,038
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's some projects that are also already in this, that are already referred to this committee.

528
00:51:46,118 --> 00:51:51,041
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm happy to talk about timelines for those existing projects as well.

529
00:51:51,882 --> 00:52:04,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Callahan and Clerk, I know this is a, is it possible to get the relevant part of the governing agenda up on the screen, have it handy in a digital form?

530
00:52:05,697 --> 00:52:06,498
[SPEAKER_01]: just yet.

531
00:52:06,958 --> 00:52:09,300
[SPEAKER_01]: Chair Leming, I have it handy if you want me to share.

532
00:52:09,761 --> 00:52:10,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, go ahead.

533
00:52:11,162 --> 00:52:12,443
[SPEAKER_02]: And Councilor Callahan.

534
00:52:13,665 --> 00:52:14,385
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

535
00:52:14,585 --> 00:52:29,800
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just hoping because I know we're short on time, but it would be great if the ordinance those that are listed here would major partisan ordinances if someone could simply give like a very basic sort of status of those that would be very helpful.

536
00:52:32,742 --> 00:52:32,962
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

537
00:52:33,503 --> 00:52:43,130
[SPEAKER_01]: I chair let me if I can I know I have a bunch of these ordinances, I can give an update as to most of them actually absolutely work.

538
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:49,074
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so for the gender equity commission the Youth Commission on there under the same paper number.

539
00:52:49,094 --> 00:52:55,279
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm currently meeting, so the in our last committee meeting subcommittee meeting.

540
00:52:56,099 --> 00:53:03,026
[SPEAKER_01]: The committee voted for me to meet with relevant department heads to work out certain questions that they had for us.

541
00:53:04,527 --> 00:53:08,110
[SPEAKER_01]: The department heads were largely very, very enthusiastic about these ideas.

542
00:53:08,671 --> 00:53:16,918
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some logistical questions to work through, and so the hope is for me to meet with them sometime in the next few weeks and get a

543
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:38,371
[SPEAKER_01]: uh updated drafts for this committee um in the next few for for either the next meeting or the meeting after that um we've just had some scheduling difficulties for the welcoming city ordinance um that is something that um has that i think on the timeline we've put in the spring um it has

544
00:53:39,111 --> 00:53:44,153
[SPEAKER_01]: The paper is created, it passed through regular committee, so it's sent to our committee.

545
00:53:45,374 --> 00:53:46,754
[SPEAKER_01]: We just have not met on it yet.

546
00:53:46,874 --> 00:53:50,076
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we will probably do an introductory meeting.

547
00:53:51,021 --> 00:53:57,064
[SPEAKER_01]: probably when we're done with the commission ordinances, but perhaps slightly overlapping.

548
00:53:58,464 --> 00:54:05,187
[SPEAKER_01]: The data equity idea, that also has a paper number already attached to it.

549
00:54:06,087 --> 00:54:08,268
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that will take time, to be honest.

550
00:54:08,288 --> 00:54:14,531
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we'll need to work a lot with the chief of staff and with the mayor's office to see

551
00:54:15,111 --> 00:54:16,331
[SPEAKER_01]: what that actually looks like.

552
00:54:16,452 --> 00:54:23,734
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want it to be punitive for the city government or overly bureaucratic, and so I think that will take time.

553
00:54:23,854 --> 00:54:30,897
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the state has passed something last year that will help us comply with the possible ordinance much more easier, but

554
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:45,222
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that's an idea that I requested be placed later on in the timeline.

555
00:54:46,423 --> 00:54:51,885
[SPEAKER_01]: I think open data is a similar situation, although there has not been... Sorry to interrupt.

556
00:54:52,125 --> 00:54:56,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so you mentioned the cheapest apps, the point person for the data equity and open data laws.

557
00:54:57,047 --> 00:55:04,790
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, is it... I mean, do you think it would be appropriate to go, like, you know, do another request for sort of information about this?

558
00:55:04,810 --> 00:55:06,971
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not even sure how that would be phrased.

559
00:55:07,851 --> 00:55:08,572
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we can...

560
00:55:09,662 --> 00:55:29,601
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the so it's not as much that she's a lead I just think she, I think the chief of staff in general, whoever's in that position would be a good person to work with before it before we either before we formally introduce this proposal to the committee, or walking like to have at our first meeting on this.

561
00:55:30,482 --> 00:55:34,065
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so that's that's just what I mean it's nothing so I mean.

562
00:55:35,467 --> 00:55:43,597
[SPEAKER_01]: I think perhaps it'd be smarter to bang out some of the draft language with the mayor's office beforehand.

563
00:55:44,558 --> 00:55:46,480
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's similar with the open data ordinance.

564
00:55:48,894 --> 00:55:57,960
[SPEAKER_01]: I think some of these other ones that I've proposed, they don't have paper numbers attached to them yet.

565
00:55:58,340 --> 00:56:02,402
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we should finish some of the projects that are open first before we get to them.

566
00:56:03,783 --> 00:56:11,808
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the language access policy or slash ordinances in a similar place to the data ones, similar situation.

567
00:56:12,188 --> 00:56:16,591
[SPEAKER_01]: The Immigrants Commission is something that I would love to get started.

568
00:56:18,712 --> 00:56:24,339
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we have put that on this, perhaps, as a goal for next year.

569
00:56:26,301 --> 00:56:34,651
[SPEAKER_01]: And Human Rights Commission reform, so essentially, members of the Human Rights Commission and former members of the Human Rights Commission have asked

570
00:56:35,191 --> 00:56:41,553
[SPEAKER_01]: me as a counselor to initiate a review of the enabling ordinance that created the commission and gives it its powers.

571
00:56:42,654 --> 00:56:48,896
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm currently meeting with those members to find out what reforms exactly are being asked of us.

572
00:56:49,796 --> 00:57:03,301
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that's going to require talking to the DEI director, talking to the members of the HRC and former members of the HRC to see what changes that entails before we present it to this committee.

573
00:57:05,307 --> 00:57:14,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think it would be good if those discussions are done one-on-one, or can we just ask Francis about that the next time?

574
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:18,329
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it would be easier if they were done one-on-one, to be frank.

575
00:57:18,349 --> 00:57:22,770
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we can invite them to our committee meetings when we actually work through a draft together with the councilors.

576
00:57:22,810 --> 00:57:32,092
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think it would be hard for, at least if I were to take the lead on this, it'd be hard for me to present you guys with the draft if I hadn't done those meetings yet.

577
00:57:33,467 --> 00:57:36,869
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm doing the first round of them tomorrow actually.

578
00:57:36,949 --> 00:57:41,452
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but I think it's a project down the road, like in a few months.

579
00:57:44,875 --> 00:57:47,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that's all right.

580
00:57:47,296 --> 00:57:48,057
[SPEAKER_02]: That's everything.

581
00:57:48,077 --> 00:57:53,320
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a and we are right at 659.

582
00:57:53,641 --> 00:57:55,342
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I have a motion to adjourn?

583
00:57:56,738 --> 00:57:59,739
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I, we actually, sorry, chair Loving.

584
00:57:59,959 --> 00:58:03,500
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we, we have some procedural motions that we need to do first.

585
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:04,340
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

586
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:05,961
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's, let's do those.

587
00:58:06,401 --> 00:58:09,802
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I would like to motion to keep papers.

588
00:58:10,362 --> 00:58:11,522
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me one second.

589
00:58:12,263 --> 00:58:13,223
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, papers.

590
00:58:13,243 --> 00:58:18,865
[SPEAKER_01]: 24 dash 0 1 5 and 24 dash 0 2, 2 in committee.

591
00:58:21,145 --> 00:58:21,705
[SPEAKER_02]: We have second.

592
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:23,686
[SPEAKER_02]: I got second.

593
00:58:25,319 --> 00:58:27,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, second from Councilor Callahan.

594
00:58:28,081 --> 00:58:30,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Clerk, is this a roll call?

595
00:58:30,823 --> 00:58:31,163
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

596
00:58:32,444 --> 00:58:33,705
[SPEAKER_01]: All Zoom votes are roll calls.

597
00:58:35,686 --> 00:58:37,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, yeah, okay.

598
00:58:37,528 --> 00:58:38,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Clerk, please call the roll.

599
00:58:41,931 --> 00:58:42,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Callahan.

600
00:58:43,452 --> 00:58:43,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

601
00:58:44,693 --> 00:58:45,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Lazaro.

602
00:58:46,194 --> 00:58:46,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

603
00:58:47,155 --> 00:58:48,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli.

604
00:58:48,676 --> 00:58:48,976
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

605
00:58:49,616 --> 00:58:50,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Stang.

606
00:58:50,797 --> 00:58:51,037
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

607
00:58:51,658 --> 00:58:52,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Chair Lemmon.

608
00:58:52,558 --> 00:58:52,799
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

609
00:58:54,846 --> 00:58:58,689
[SPEAKER_01]: If I may, Chair, let me make another motion.

610
00:59:00,350 --> 00:59:10,759
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd also motion that councilors submit feedback and ideas about modernizing city council communications before the next meeting to the clerk and the chair.

611
00:59:10,779 --> 00:59:15,623
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that way we can save some time going into our next meeting.

612
00:59:15,643 --> 00:59:17,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have a second?

613
00:59:19,166 --> 00:59:19,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

614
00:59:20,988 --> 00:59:21,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Second.

615
00:59:23,135 --> 00:59:26,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, second from counselor was our Oh, please.

616
00:59:26,599 --> 00:59:26,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

617
00:59:40,441 --> 00:59:41,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scott Kelly.

618
00:59:41,881 --> 00:59:42,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

619
00:59:42,742 --> 00:59:43,362
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Stang.

620
00:59:43,742 --> 00:59:43,982
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

621
00:59:44,582 --> 00:59:45,062
[SPEAKER_03]: Chair Lemons.

622
00:59:45,603 --> 00:59:45,863
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

623
00:59:46,843 --> 00:59:53,245
[SPEAKER_01]: And sorry, I just have a lot of procedural things that we unfortunately have to go through.

624
00:59:56,166 --> 01:00:07,449
[SPEAKER_01]: I was wondering if we felt comfortable enough with the governing agenda to receive and place on file or whether we wanna keep it open as a paper and committee.

625
01:00:08,169 --> 01:00:10,090
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll defer to the other councilors on that.

626
01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:16,983
[SPEAKER_06]: If we receive in place on file, does that mean we don't access it in committee anymore?

627
01:00:17,003 --> 01:00:19,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Or can we still access it in committee?

628
01:00:19,744 --> 01:00:27,548
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I mean, I believe the president and vice president of the council have said that every few months we'll review it.

629
01:00:28,889 --> 01:00:35,032
[SPEAKER_01]: It certainly doesn't, I guess, it just means, I think the clerk has something to say.

630
01:00:35,112 --> 01:00:35,853
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

631
01:00:36,333 --> 01:00:40,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor saying, I believe that if you receive in place on file, you dispose of the paper.

632
01:00:41,519 --> 01:00:54,469
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't think we would talk about the governing agenda or amending it right now until the city council creates another paper to discuss it again.

633
01:00:59,233 --> 01:01:01,595
[SPEAKER_02]: So do we want to discuss the governing agenda?

634
01:01:01,635 --> 01:01:05,978
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like the governing agenda is something that we might want to take.

635
01:01:06,759 --> 01:01:07,279
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

636
01:01:08,757 --> 01:01:14,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we still allowed to look at it in future resident services and public engagement meetings?

637
01:01:18,211 --> 01:01:22,815
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just, I'm just, I'm just not like, are you, are you, are you asking me?

638
01:01:23,536 --> 01:01:24,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sorry.

639
01:01:24,096 --> 01:01:28,340
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just, I'm just not, I'm just not, I'm still like, sorry, I'm still like not, not, not a hundred percent clear.

640
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:31,582
[SPEAKER_02]: I like what the consequences of totally, totally cool.

641
01:01:32,163 --> 01:01:37,787
[SPEAKER_03]: My, I believe that if you receive and placed on file that you are disposing of the paper, you would have to vote.

642
01:01:37,807 --> 01:01:40,289
[SPEAKER_03]: You would actually have to file a new resolution, but I,

643
01:01:41,070 --> 01:01:48,617
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought the The council needs to correct me on this because it's it's not it's it's not my document But I thought that this was supposed to be a working document.

644
01:01:48,677 --> 01:02:03,169
[SPEAKER_04]: It was supposed to be That's what I I'm under the same Understanding if we if we we dispose this paper if we do that that that's been practiced I believe adam for for a while if you receive in place on file.

645
01:02:03,329 --> 01:02:06,272
[SPEAKER_04]: It's we have to re um re-enter it

646
01:02:07,110 --> 01:02:09,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I think, yeah, sorry.

647
01:02:10,272 --> 01:02:13,314
[SPEAKER_04]: We just continue it.

648
01:02:15,016 --> 01:02:15,576
[SPEAKER_04]: What can we do?

649
01:02:16,817 --> 01:02:18,438
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to take any vote on it.

650
01:02:18,558 --> 01:02:19,579
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in the committee already.

651
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:21,120
[SPEAKER_03]: It just stays there until you move it out.

652
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:21,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

653
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:21,881
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

654
01:02:21,941 --> 01:02:22,261
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.

655
01:02:22,441 --> 01:02:35,751
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all we have to do is leave it alone because I think this is a working document because we could bring it up at our next meeting and that could be modified by asking for the certain guests that we want to come and help us

656
01:02:36,611 --> 01:02:38,513
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, get to some sort of resolution.

657
01:02:38,593 --> 01:02:41,895
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, that, that sounds good to me.

658
01:02:42,336 --> 01:02:45,538
[SPEAKER_01]: I only suggested it because I know other committees have disposed of the paper.

659
01:02:45,718 --> 01:02:52,744
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I was, uh, that's the only reason in that case, I'll move to adjourn second.

660
01:02:54,746 --> 01:02:54,926
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

661
01:02:54,986 --> 01:02:57,568
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't say, no, I said, do we have a second?

662
01:02:57,588 --> 01:02:58,388
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought you were second.

663
01:02:58,889 --> 01:02:59,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

664
01:03:02,046 --> 01:03:02,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Clerk, please call the roll.

665
01:03:03,687 --> 01:03:04,568
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, who's the second?

666
01:03:04,748 --> 01:03:05,208
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't hear it.

667
01:03:05,228 --> 01:03:06,129
[SPEAKER_03]: Councillor Scarpelli.
