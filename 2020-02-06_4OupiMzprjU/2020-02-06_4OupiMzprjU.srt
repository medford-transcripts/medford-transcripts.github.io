[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

54
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:14,061
[SPEAKER_18]: Member Kreatz?

55
00:06:14,501 --> 00:06:14,781
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yes.

56
00:06:15,382 --> 00:06:22,344
[SPEAKER_10]: I just have a question, and I'm familiar with the report and the reimbursement process.

57
00:06:22,824 --> 00:06:28,146
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to explain to the new committee members, and maybe, Christine, if you could explain, Ms.

58
00:06:28,186 --> 00:06:38,249
[SPEAKER_10]: Patterson, how a teacher or administrator submits a reimbursement, like what's required in order for them to get reimbursed, and do they get full reimbursement?

59
00:06:38,749 --> 00:06:39,109
[SPEAKER_22]: Certainly.

60
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:48,638
[SPEAKER_22]: So for anybody to be paid or reimbursed through the city, we require W-9 for them to be established as a vendor.

61
00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:52,481
[SPEAKER_22]: They would not be submitting or receiving a 1099.

62
00:06:52,821 --> 00:06:55,203
[SPEAKER_22]: It would be documented that this is for reimbursement.

63
00:06:56,184 --> 00:07:01,549
[SPEAKER_22]: We do discourage initial purchases that would include any sales tax.

64
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:10,447
[SPEAKER_22]: we cannot reimburse sales tax and meals tax, but that's not usually what is submitted.

65
00:07:10,808 --> 00:07:16,754
[SPEAKER_22]: But per Mass General Law, we are an exempt entity, so therefore we cannot reimburse for tax.

66
00:07:17,114 --> 00:07:25,222
[SPEAKER_22]: So we highly encourage everybody to utilize the purchase order system in order to request the goods or materials that they need.

67
00:07:25,836 --> 00:07:36,923
[SPEAKER_22]: or contracted service so that they are not, number one, putting out any of their own funds, and number two, so that there is a full reimbursement as needed.

68
00:07:36,943 --> 00:07:39,004
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

69
00:07:39,825 --> 00:07:40,105
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

70
00:07:49,867 --> 00:08:01,476
[SPEAKER_18]: Prior to the report of secretary, I'd like to make a motion to suspend the rules for the purposes of discussing a proclamation to make Medford hunger-free and also to move up community participation.

71
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:24,370
[SPEAKER_27]: Hunger Free Pledge.

72
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:31,414
[SPEAKER_27]: I know we have Sarah McGiven and Carol present.

73
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:52,124
[SPEAKER_27]: And I will read the proclamation to make Medford hunger free, whereas hunger and poverty are issues of grave concern in the United States, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and the city of Method, whereas Medford is committed to educating people about food insecurity,

74
00:08:52,657 --> 00:09:21,478
[SPEAKER_27]: and the importance of food banks in alleviating hunger in our communities, whereas food insecurity is a persistent and significant reality in Medford, where one in 10 people, one in eight children, and one in 14 seniors do not know where the next meal will come from, whereas the Greater Boston Food Bank and its member agencies provide vital hunger relief services to our most vulnerable neighbors, whereas Medford shall work with hunger relief organizations to make eastern Massachusetts hunger-free

75
00:09:21,957 --> 00:09:25,840
[SPEAKER_27]: by supporting access to three healthy meals a day for our residents in need.

76
00:09:26,361 --> 00:09:43,535
[SPEAKER_27]: Now, therefore, be it resolved that the Medford School Committee does hereby proclaim no later than January 1st, 2028, Medford will be hunger-free and urge all the residents of Medford to take note of this proclamation and participate fittingly in achieving this important goal.

77
00:09:44,456 --> 00:09:49,360
[SPEAKER_27]: And an advisory committee shall be created to provide specific recommendations for achieving this goal.

78
00:09:50,617 --> 00:10:00,181
[SPEAKER_27]: with appointments for one year to include at least a teacher, school administrator, nursing representative, adjustment Councilor, food services representative, and three school committee members.

79
00:10:00,821 --> 00:10:17,208
[SPEAKER_27]: The advisory committee shall provide at least an interim status report within six months of their first meeting and provide a final report to the school committee prior to the end of the one-year term of this advisory committee, given at the City Hall in Medford, Massachusetts this third day in February in the year 2020.

80
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:25,202
[SPEAKER_29]: Honorable Mayor, Dr. Edouard Vincent, honorable members of the school committee.

81
00:10:25,242 --> 00:10:26,422
[SPEAKER_29]: My name is Carol Tinkin.

82
00:10:26,762 --> 00:10:27,943
[SPEAKER_29]: I am a Medford resident.

83
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:30,024
[SPEAKER_29]: I live at 261 Governors Avenue.

84
00:10:30,604 --> 00:10:36,968
[SPEAKER_29]: I am also the Chief Operating Officer and the Senior Vice President of Distribution Services at the Greater Boston Food Bank.

85
00:10:37,728 --> 00:10:51,601
[SPEAKER_29]: I am here to commend the city of Method on this bold step that it's taking to stand up and take leadership to end hunger in Medford and hopefully lead other cities and towns in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to do the same and take the same step.

86
00:10:52,341 --> 00:10:57,726
[SPEAKER_29]: We all know that children in particular cannot function, cannot think, cannot act without decent food.

87
00:10:58,467 --> 00:11:08,819
[SPEAKER_29]: Their families cannot support them either without good support and good food and healthy food and nutritious food every day and have access.

88
00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:11,122
[SPEAKER_29]: We also want to thank and commend

89
00:11:11,601 --> 00:11:15,083
[SPEAKER_29]: the City of Medford for the food security task force that it created.

90
00:11:15,503 --> 00:11:35,014
[SPEAKER_29]: The Greater Boston Food Bank has been doing this work for two and a half years, and I want to share that we have seen Medford go from the third most underserved community in eastern Massachusetts by 36%, meaning that they only were processing about one meal a day in the City of Medford to now being over 70% in less than a year.

91
00:11:36,815 --> 00:11:39,056
[SPEAKER_29]: We believe we can continue to close this gap.

92
00:11:40,276 --> 00:11:43,358
[SPEAKER_29]: We want to thank Project Bread, our colleagues.

93
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:49,260
[SPEAKER_29]: We also want to thank the Unitarian Universalist, sorry, St.

94
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,081
[SPEAKER_29]: Ray's and St.

95
00:11:50,121 --> 00:11:51,781
[SPEAKER_29]: Francis for the work that they've done.

96
00:11:51,981 --> 00:12:00,865
[SPEAKER_29]: And we also, I would be remiss in not recognizing members of the school committee, especially Mia Mostone, who's been working with us very closely during this time.

97
00:12:01,225 --> 00:12:01,765
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Mayor.

98
00:12:01,925 --> 00:12:02,206
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

99
00:12:03,406 --> 00:12:05,207
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh, the YMCA in Malden, sorry.

100
00:12:05,228 --> 00:12:07,169
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, YMCA, it's great.

101
00:12:07,689 --> 00:12:13,393
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, I'm Sara McGivern, 63 Watervale Road.

102
00:12:13,453 --> 00:12:19,138
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm the Mass in Motion Coordinator in the Board of Health, and I'm the coordinator of the Medford Food Security Task Force.

103
00:12:19,818 --> 00:12:30,426
[SPEAKER_13]: We convened about two years ago because we saw that there was need for different entities in the community to work together and to have common goals on getting our city hunger-free.

104
00:12:31,369 --> 00:12:32,411
[SPEAKER_13]: Just past two years.

105
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:33,232
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been amazing.

106
00:12:33,292 --> 00:12:41,882
[SPEAKER_13]: We actually just published this food plan about two months ago Short versions of it There are some

107
00:12:47,481 --> 00:12:53,844
[SPEAKER_13]: some recommendations in there for what we can do to work on getting our city to become hunger free.

108
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:58,165
[SPEAKER_13]: I think this year is going to be a really great year of action.

109
00:12:58,205 --> 00:13:03,227
[SPEAKER_13]: We've been doing planning and now we're going to be taking steps to really eradicate hunger.

110
00:13:04,748 --> 00:13:10,871
[SPEAKER_13]: There's already a lot of action taking place, but it's going to be a unified group effort.

111
00:13:14,542 --> 00:13:16,908
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess don't have anything else to say.

112
00:13:16,928 --> 00:13:17,369
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks.

113
00:13:20,076 --> 00:13:20,798
[SPEAKER_27]: Member McLaughlin.

114
00:13:22,499 --> 00:13:35,042
[SPEAKER_24]: I wanted to thank you and Mia for introducing me to the Food Security Task Force and Shira and Carol and Sarah Klugisch and all the folks in Medford who are working on this really important issue.

115
00:13:35,082 --> 00:13:41,064
[SPEAKER_24]: I learned two very important things from the Food Security Task Force when I attended their meeting.

116
00:13:41,124 --> 00:13:45,145
[SPEAKER_24]: And one was that I said, you know, why don't you just call it hunger?

117
00:13:45,962 --> 00:13:48,683
[SPEAKER_24]: And you know, why do you keep calling it food insecurity?

118
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:49,724
[SPEAKER_24]: What does that actually mean?

119
00:13:49,764 --> 00:13:57,847
[SPEAKER_24]: And they shared with me that we're all hungry every day, but food insecurity is very different than being hungry.

120
00:13:57,947 --> 00:14:00,649
[SPEAKER_24]: Hungry, we know when our next meal is coming.

121
00:14:00,669 --> 00:14:04,570
[SPEAKER_24]: Food insecurity is when you don't know where your next meal is coming from and how you'll get it.

122
00:14:05,071 --> 00:14:06,331
[SPEAKER_24]: And that really stood out to me.

123
00:14:06,411 --> 00:14:13,114
[SPEAKER_24]: And also where they were sharing the one in nine Medford households experience food insecurity.

124
00:14:13,174 --> 00:14:14,255
[SPEAKER_24]: And one of the things that the food,

125
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:28,028
[SPEAKER_24]: task force really wanted to work on was de-stigmatizing food insecurity because often it's the case that we know people that are experiencing food insecurity and they're not sharing that with us because of the stigma attached to

126
00:14:28,999 --> 00:14:30,640
[SPEAKER_24]: having food insecurity and being hungry.

127
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,261
[SPEAKER_24]: So I really applaud the work of the Food Security Task Force.

128
00:14:34,301 --> 00:14:37,482
[SPEAKER_24]: And thank you, Mia, and all for bringing it forward.

129
00:14:37,522 --> 00:14:44,885
[SPEAKER_24]: And I would encourage community members to attend the meetings and get involved as much as you can, because I know that none of us want to see a child hungry.

130
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:45,625
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

131
00:14:45,905 --> 00:14:46,185
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

132
00:14:47,285 --> 00:14:47,986
[SPEAKER_18]: Member van de Kloot.

133
00:14:48,006 --> 00:14:50,887
[SPEAKER_18]: I just want to say thank you to all those involved.

134
00:14:50,907 --> 00:14:51,827
[SPEAKER_18]: This is a great thing.

135
00:14:52,067 --> 00:14:54,648
[SPEAKER_18]: And motion for approval.

136
00:14:57,309 --> 00:14:57,829
[SPEAKER_27]: Member Ruseau?

137
00:14:58,450 --> 00:14:59,510
[SPEAKER_34]: I'll second the motion.

138
00:15:00,031 --> 00:15:04,912
[SPEAKER_34]: And I also wanted to add that I look forward to the advisory committee.

139
00:15:06,053 --> 00:15:14,576
[SPEAKER_34]: I've been pretty vocal on this proclamation that as much as the proclamation feels good, the proclamation won't help anybody.

140
00:15:16,294 --> 00:15:17,514
[SPEAKER_34]: with their food insecurity.

141
00:15:17,594 --> 00:15:32,717
[SPEAKER_34]: So it's important that we have actions coming out of this, and I look forward to hopefully being part of this advisory committee to figure out what we can do in our schools, understanding what it would cost, and really making sure that we are closing the gap as needed here.

142
00:15:33,517 --> 00:15:33,817
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

143
00:15:34,357 --> 00:15:34,657
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

144
00:15:35,197 --> 00:15:39,698

[SPEAKER_18]: Member Graham?

148
00:15:45,138 --> 00:15:45,798
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

149
00:15:45,818 --> 00:15:46,318
[SPEAKER_18]: Member Kreatz?

150
00:15:46,338 --> 00:15:46,398
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

151
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:48,059
[SPEAKER_18]: Member McLaughlin?

152
00:15:48,439 --> 00:15:48,579
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

153
00:15:48,979 --> 00:15:49,639
[SPEAKER_18]: Member Mustone?

154
00:15:49,659 --> 00:15:49,719
[SPEAKER_35]: Yes.

155
00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:51,179
[SPEAKER_18]: Member Ruseau?

156
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,120
[SPEAKER_34]: Yes.

157
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:54,860
[SPEAKER_18]: Member Van der Kloot?

158
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,140
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

159
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,341
[SPEAKER_18]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn?

160
00:15:56,401 --> 00:15:56,621
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes.

161
00:15:56,641 --> 00:15:59,761
[SPEAKER_27]: 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

162
00:16:00,281 --> 00:16:01,322
[SPEAKER_27]: The paper passes.

163
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:06,723
[SPEAKER_27]: This proclamation will now go to the City Council tomorrow night and hopefully as one unified

164
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:27,914
[SPEAKER_27]: While we're under suspension, member Van der Kloot, resolution number five, as well as participation from our students that we have here.

165
00:16:27,934 --> 00:16:29,175
[SPEAKER_27]: Is that correct?

166
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:38,059
[SPEAKER_27]: Be it resolved that the Medford, this is offered by myself, with regards to the minimum wage question that a number of us have been asked.

167
00:16:38,479 --> 00:16:43,981
[SPEAKER_27]: Be it resolved that the school committee hold a committee of the whole meeting to discuss minimum wage for all employees.

168
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:48,063
[SPEAKER_27]: Be it further resolved that the administration provide the school committee with a list of all

169
00:16:48,522 --> 00:16:52,627
[SPEAKER_27]: do not receive minimum wage and what the cost per year would be to make that change.

170
00:16:53,969 --> 00:17:04,743
[SPEAKER_27]: I know there are a number of people that want to speak on that so we'll open up the floor to you and hopefully within the next 30 to 40 days we will hold a committee of the whole to get all the facts and figures before us as well as the law.

171
00:17:11,271 --> 00:17:18,022
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello, my name is Brenna Christensen, and I'm a senior at Medford High School, and I've had the wonderful opportunity to work at the Brooks Afterschool Program for two years.

172
00:17:18,623 --> 00:17:25,235
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to thank the mayor, the superintendent, assistant superintendent, and school committee members for listening to our concerns regarding our wages.

173
00:17:26,035 --> 00:17:29,378
[SPEAKER_12]: Working at the Brooks Afterschool Program is truly my favorite part of the day.

174
00:17:29,838 --> 00:17:33,782
[SPEAKER_12]: I've had the pleasure of working there and grew such a strong bond with my co-workers and the students.

175
00:17:34,462 --> 00:17:41,248
[SPEAKER_12]: As a high school assistant, we are the ones who fill in for when group leaders are out sick or when there is a day where the program is severely understaffed.

176
00:17:41,829 --> 00:17:48,514
[SPEAKER_12]: I have missed countless practices, school events, and more because I knew how badly understaffed work was and how desperately they needed our help.

177
00:17:49,555 --> 00:17:53,680
[SPEAKER_12]: As a Mustang, I've always been told that when there's a concern or an issue, to use your voice.

178
00:17:54,220 --> 00:18:04,691
[SPEAKER_12]: When the high school afterschool workers and I had been continuously given dismissive answers to our minimum wage questions, it was clear that we were getting taken advantage of and it was time to come together and raise our concerns.

179
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:10,477
[SPEAKER_12]: Because there is no afterschool union, us teams have formed our own group to work together to try and seek a resolution.

180
00:18:10,997 --> 00:18:17,083
[SPEAKER_12]: The Medford public school system should be proud that they have taught us to ask questions, seek clarification, and to stand up for what is right.

181
00:18:17,603 --> 00:18:23,368
[SPEAKER_12]: As I know how much the after-school program means to the city, transparency and fair wages within our job means as much to us.

182
00:18:23,889 --> 00:18:32,537
[SPEAKER_12]: Myself, along with many of my co-workers, will be heading off to college soon, and I want to make this important job, one that I love so much, fair to those who will eventually take my place.

183
00:18:32,837 --> 00:18:33,157
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

184
00:18:33,778 --> 00:18:34,058
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

185
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:39,752
[SPEAKER_23]: Hi, my name is Sawong Ansah, and I'm a senior at Medford High School.

186
00:18:40,313 --> 00:18:43,694
[SPEAKER_23]: I, along with Brenna, started working at the Brooks Afterschool in September of 2018.

187
00:18:45,135 --> 00:18:51,757
[SPEAKER_23]: When many of us first started working at the afterschool, we were making $11 an hour, which was the minimum wage at the time.

188
00:18:52,178 --> 00:19:01,602
[SPEAKER_23]: We were told when we took the job that we would be getting paid minimum wage, and none of us had any idea that our wage would not rise when the minimum wage increased in January of 2019.

189
00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:08,390
[SPEAKER_23]: We made repeated inquiries during the 2019 year, but it seemed like no one had answers to give us.

190
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:15,811
[SPEAKER_23]: In retrospect, it seems like everyone was taking advantage of the fact that we were kids and unwilling to question authority.

191
00:19:16,591 --> 00:19:23,433
[SPEAKER_23]: Finally, the issue of our pay was brought up at the November 18, 2019 school committee meeting, which many of you took issue with.

192
00:19:23,973 --> 00:19:29,654
[SPEAKER_23]: Mayor Burke then went on record saying that as of January 2020, we must be paid $13 an hour.

193
00:19:31,786 --> 00:19:39,530
[SPEAKER_23]: We were overjoyed to hear this, and many of us did not raise the issue further, assuming that our wages would increase, as was promised to us.

194
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:46,234
[SPEAKER_23]: Now that it is 2020 and our wages have not increased, many of us have had enough.

195
00:19:46,694 --> 00:19:56,359
[SPEAKER_23]: We keep getting told to wait, or to consider how expensive it is to increase our wages, and that everyone is on our side, despite the fact that this issue has been going on for over a year.

196
00:19:56,919 --> 00:19:58,420
[SPEAKER_23]: At the end of the day, it is not fair

197
00:19:59,662 --> 00:20:05,626
[SPEAKER_23]: that we are doing a job that the city needs us to do, and we are not getting compensated fairly for it.

198
00:20:06,647 --> 00:20:06,967
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

199
00:20:09,589 --> 00:20:10,149
[SPEAKER_33]: Good evening.

200
00:20:10,249 --> 00:20:12,110
[SPEAKER_33]: My name is Rachel Klein, and I'm also a senior.

201
00:20:12,891 --> 00:20:15,253
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you for the opportunity to address you this evening.

202
00:20:16,113 --> 00:20:21,577
[SPEAKER_33]: As previously mentioned, the afterschool aides waited for a year to get any response back about our situation.

203
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:26,140
[SPEAKER_33]: It is only now that we were told that Medford is supposedly exempt from minimum wage law.

204
00:20:26,513 --> 00:20:31,455
[SPEAKER_33]: because of section 454.27.06 in the Code of Massachusetts Regulations.

205
00:20:32,256 --> 00:20:40,340
[SPEAKER_33]: If Medford is exempt, this is something that we should have been told the minute our wages stopped corresponding with the minimum wage, but we were only told this two weeks ago.

206
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:46,202
[SPEAKER_33]: The law states that to be exempt from minimum wage law, the city needs to have a waiver from the state.

207
00:20:46,763 --> 00:20:49,004
[SPEAKER_33]: When we were told this, we asked to see that certificate.

208
00:20:49,504 --> 00:20:50,544
[SPEAKER_33]: We still have not seen it.

209
00:20:51,145 --> 00:20:55,867
[SPEAKER_33]: So we're gonna ask again today that you guys produce the certificate without delay.

210
00:20:57,622 --> 00:21:00,823
[SPEAKER_33]: But at the end of the day, this is more than about just the law.

211
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:02,944
[SPEAKER_33]: This is about fundamental fairness.

212
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:16,449
[SPEAKER_33]: Over the course of the past year, representations were continually made to us that the wage issue would be taken care of, culminating at that school committee meeting in November, where we were promised to get $13 an hour for our work.

213
00:21:17,269 --> 00:21:21,130
[SPEAKER_33]: Many of you went on record taking issue with the situation at the afterschool.

214
00:21:22,351 --> 00:21:26,012
[SPEAKER_33]: We work hard in the afterschool every day, and we are an essential part of the program.

215
00:21:26,567 --> 00:21:34,572
[SPEAKER_33]: We often come in at a moment's notice because the program is short-staffed on that particular day, yet we still continue to be undervalued and underpaid.

216
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:43,318
[SPEAKER_33]: We are performing a job that the city needs us to do, and we're giving up our free days to help make sure this program runs, and yet we are making less than minimum wage.

217
00:21:44,517 --> 00:21:52,321
[SPEAKER_33]: We have patiently waited for over a year only to be told at the 11th hour that the program and the city are exempt from minimum wage.

218
00:21:52,921 --> 00:21:59,864
[SPEAKER_33]: We had continued to work this past year based on representations made to us that the wage issue was being taken care of.

219
00:22:01,065 --> 00:22:08,969
[SPEAKER_33]: In order to make this right, we deserve to be paid minimum wage going forward and to get retroactive pay starting from when the issue first began.

220
00:22:09,878 --> 00:22:19,241
[SPEAKER_33]: We truly do want to reach a resolution quietly and as soon as possible, but going forward in this process, we need to be much more informed and involved with these decisions.

221
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:22,902
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you for your time and consideration, and I hope we can work things out.

222
00:22:23,622 --> 00:22:28,924
[SPEAKER_33]: We also have a letter from a parent at the afterschool who wanted to, who couldn't be here tonight.

223
00:22:37,048 --> 00:22:38,409
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Nancy Donlan.

224
00:22:38,489 --> 00:22:43,831
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm one of the teachers at the high school and I'm here because I'm familiar with the issue.

225
00:22:44,592 --> 00:22:49,014
[SPEAKER_01]: Many, if not most of the students involved in this, I'm familiar with.

226
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:50,195
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had them in class.

227
00:22:50,315 --> 00:22:52,316
[SPEAKER_01]: I've taught in Medford for 19 years.

228
00:22:52,916 --> 00:23:03,722
[SPEAKER_01]: They are without question the most intelligent, lovely, um, extremely valued young people that you could meet anywhere.

229
00:23:04,642 --> 00:23:06,023
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm, but I'm here because,

230
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:13,011
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the students involved in this said last week that she wished she'd never signed the petition.

231
00:23:14,272 --> 00:23:27,615
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I inquired about that, she said, I wish I never signed it because we're getting so much negativity directed to us by administrators, by faculty, by our fellow students.

232
00:23:28,055 --> 00:23:31,035
[SPEAKER_01]: And quite honestly, that upsets me to no end.

233
00:23:31,655 --> 00:23:34,316
[SPEAKER_01]: These are young people that have

234
00:23:35,217 --> 00:23:39,718
[SPEAKER_01]: have really gone way out of their way to advocate for themselves.

235
00:23:39,778 --> 00:23:48,199
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a teacher, I feel that that's one of my most primary responsibilities, to get my students to be able to advocate for themselves.

236
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:57,221
[SPEAKER_01]: Secondarily, the social studies curriculum is changing in a fundamental way to incorporate civics into the new instruction.

237
00:23:57,661 --> 00:24:01,282
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't pick and choose what civic issues

238
00:24:01,806 --> 00:24:05,549
[SPEAKER_01]: we think are important for our students to engage in and which ones aren't.

239
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:19,139
[SPEAKER_01]: If the advocacy that they take for themselves happens to be with language that we may feel is inappropriate or not quite at an adult or professional level, they're young people.

240
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:26,365
[SPEAKER_01]: And our job is to teach them how to bring their ideas and how to bring their concerns to a place where

241
00:24:26,835 --> 00:24:38,346
[SPEAKER_01]: they can engage civically and ultimately resolve the issue, perhaps to their advantage or not, but to really take those steps to advocate for themselves.

242
00:24:38,726 --> 00:24:49,196
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very disheartening to hear a student say that I wished I never put my name to the petition because of the way in which we're being treated for our advocacy.

243
00:24:49,636 --> 00:24:51,398
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you very sincerely

244
00:24:52,534 --> 00:25:00,017
[SPEAKER_01]: recognize and applaud the advocacy steps that they've taken, irregardless of how this issue is resolved.

245
00:25:00,117 --> 00:25:02,338
[SPEAKER_01]: They are outstanding students.

246
00:25:02,398 --> 00:25:04,158
[SPEAKER_01]: We all should be proud of them.

247
00:25:04,518 --> 00:25:16,102
[SPEAKER_01]: And we should really applaud that they're doing the steps that we've taught them in a civil society as to how people resolve their issues.

248
00:25:16,722 --> 00:25:17,102
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

249
00:25:17,142 --> 00:25:18,763
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate the opportunity to speak.

250
00:25:19,343 --> 00:25:19,683
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

251
00:25:20,924 --> 00:25:21,444
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Kreatz.

252
00:25:27,589 --> 00:25:43,606
[SPEAKER_10]: First, I have to disclose that my sister works as an assistant group leader in the after school program and I already completed a disclosure of appearance of conflict of interest form and I submitted it with the city clerk's office last Thursday so I could speak this evening.

253
00:25:46,741 --> 00:25:59,366
[SPEAKER_10]: After learning, immediately after the school committee meeting in November, I heard from some students and they had told me that they were still making the minimum wage, which was the $11 an hour.

254
00:25:59,827 --> 00:26:07,290
[SPEAKER_10]: So I was a little confused because I thought that everybody was making above that, which was between the 12 and then going up to the 13.

255
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:09,831
[SPEAKER_10]: So I had sent a message off to the

256
00:26:10,851 --> 00:26:24,342
[SPEAKER_10]: assistant superintendent's office, and she was, sorry, assistant superintendent of finance, and she was going to look into, let's see, look into an option and explore a way

257
00:26:24,741 --> 00:26:27,503
[SPEAKER_10]: that we can increase it in the budget level.

258
00:26:28,103 --> 00:26:33,387
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just want to say that I really appreciate everything that you do in the after school program.

259
00:26:33,828 --> 00:26:38,431
[SPEAKER_10]: I volunteered at the Brooks, the Roberts, and I've been to the McGlynn after school programs.

260
00:26:38,851 --> 00:26:42,174
[SPEAKER_10]: And I've observed and participated and helped out in the program.

261
00:26:42,674 --> 00:26:44,075
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's very well structured.

262
00:26:44,135 --> 00:26:44,996
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a curriculum.

263
00:26:45,476 --> 00:27:03,294
[SPEAKER_10]: It starts off with physical education, either inside or outside, then everybody goes back indoors and they're doing either story time in the younger groups, arts and crafts activities, then there's homework time, and then there's some free time, and I've spent the afternoon

264
00:27:04,415 --> 00:27:08,019
[SPEAKER_10]: until it's pickup time with the classrooms that I've been in.

265
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,683
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's just been a wonderful experience for me.

266
00:27:11,723 --> 00:27:26,819
[SPEAKER_10]: And I've seen and see exactly what you do on the floor and in the schools working with the students and how they look up to you as role models and how they really appreciate everything that you're doing and just that you're a student working with another student.

267
00:27:27,259 --> 00:27:31,145
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just wonderful seeing everything that you're doing in the program.

268
00:27:31,526 --> 00:27:40,119
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just wanted to say thank you and I am very proud of everything that you do in the program and for coming out here tonight and advocating for the after school program.

269
00:27:40,419 --> 00:27:40,800
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

270
00:27:42,122 --> 00:27:42,803
[SPEAKER_27]: Member McLaughlin.

271
00:27:46,553 --> 00:27:53,256
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank the students for coming out tonight and their family and say that I'm proud of you for your self-advocacy skills.

272
00:27:53,776 --> 00:28:05,321
[SPEAKER_24]: Advocating and getting up in a microphone with lots of people looking at you in a whole room full of adults can be intimidating and it's really shows us all something that Medford should be proud of.

273
00:28:05,762 --> 00:28:10,184
[SPEAKER_24]: teaching you all to do this, and we appreciate that you came out in front of everybody to do that.

274
00:28:11,684 --> 00:28:31,872
[SPEAKER_24]: If I understood what you were saying correctly, you were looking for the retroactive for the $13 an hour that the mayor had, previous mayor, Mayor Burke, had suggested in January 2020 would be the current rate and a waiver of the certificate that you were wanting to see.

275
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:34,513
[SPEAKER_24]: I think those were the three items.

276
00:28:35,134 --> 00:28:36,255
[SPEAKER_24]: Wanted to clarify on that.

277
00:28:36,355 --> 00:28:43,120
[SPEAKER_24]: And then also wanted to make sure, Mayor Kern, that the students know what a committee of the whole meeting is.

278
00:28:44,081 --> 00:28:47,344
[SPEAKER_24]: And maybe, I don't know if you want to explain that so that they could understand.

279
00:28:47,424 --> 00:28:55,610
[SPEAKER_24]: And that if you're interested in participating, that's a public meeting and something that you get to see a lot of what happens behind the scenes in those meetings.

280
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,372
[SPEAKER_24]: And they're good to come to to learn more as well.

281
00:28:59,433 --> 00:29:02,775
[SPEAKER_27]: Committee of the whole meeting is a meeting that we have that isn't so formal.

282
00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:05,911
[SPEAKER_27]: Sometimes we had one today at 5.30.

283
00:29:05,971 --> 00:29:08,292
[SPEAKER_27]: That one was televised.

284
00:29:08,632 --> 00:29:10,093
[SPEAKER_27]: This may be a little bit different.

285
00:29:10,154 --> 00:29:33,330
[SPEAKER_27]: We were talking about personnel, so we may have to go into executive session where we have to speak about personnel matters behind closed doors, but we can reconvene after we figure things out and make a full report, whether it's that night or after that night, letting the public know what facts and figures, anything that's public, we can release that afterwards.

286
00:29:34,165 --> 00:29:48,712
[SPEAKER_27]: Also, I know this may affect other positions in the budget, so we really need to give our finance department a little, even if it's a couple of weeks, just to get facts and figures before us so that we have the answers to the questions we're all going to have in committee of the whole meeting.

287
00:29:49,373 --> 00:29:53,195
[SPEAKER_27]: I think two weeks, maybe Ms.

288
00:29:53,555 --> 00:29:57,837
[SPEAKER_27]: Patterson can enlighten us on how long that might take just

289
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:03,856
[SPEAKER_27]: make sure we know every single position that will be affected, how many we have in that position, just like my motion reads.

290
00:30:04,717 --> 00:30:09,878
[SPEAKER_27]: So I would hope within two weeks.

291
00:30:09,978 --> 00:30:16,820
[SPEAKER_24]: So point of clarification, the committee of the whole meeting is actually going to be an executive committee meeting, not a committee of the whole meeting.

292
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:25,802
[SPEAKER_27]: Not necessarily, but if we're going to talk about different people in different positions, then yes, parts of it would have to go into executive session.

293
00:30:26,963 --> 00:30:27,963
[SPEAKER_24]: But then the other parts are?

294
00:30:28,581 --> 00:30:37,986
[SPEAKER_27]: We can just, yep, whatever has to go into executive session, whether that's five, 10, 20 minutes to an hour, and then you can open it up to the general public.

295
00:30:38,927 --> 00:30:39,567
[SPEAKER_27]: Member van de Kloot.

296
00:30:40,168 --> 00:30:46,953
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, I think my colleagues have summed up many of the discussion points, but I feel particularly disheartened to hear from Ms.

297
00:30:46,973 --> 00:30:53,198
[SPEAKER_18]: Donlon that any student felt that they were getting negative feedback because of this.

298
00:30:53,398 --> 00:30:58,782
[SPEAKER_18]: And I just want to say, and add my voice, that I applaud you for coming forward and for advocating for yourself.

299
00:30:59,122 --> 00:31:01,124
[SPEAKER_18]: That is exactly what we want you to do.

300
00:31:01,524 --> 00:31:05,006
[SPEAKER_18]: And we're appreciative of your time and presence here this evening.

301
00:31:05,867 --> 00:31:06,167
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

302
00:31:06,548 --> 00:31:06,968
[SPEAKER_27]: Member Graham.

303
00:31:09,243 --> 00:31:11,524
[SPEAKER_19]: I mostly echo what Paulette had to say.

304
00:31:11,785 --> 00:31:19,168
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think one of the hardest things about advocacy is it takes a lot of personal conviction.

305
00:31:19,268 --> 00:31:23,631
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think you guys all quite clearly have that level of personal conviction.

306
00:31:24,391 --> 00:31:35,076
[SPEAKER_19]: So regardless of what anybody says to you or what the answer is, I think the cornerstone of advocacy is that if you believe in what you're advocating for,

307
00:31:36,528 --> 00:31:38,070
[SPEAKER_19]: Don't let anybody tell you differently.

308
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:40,873
[SPEAKER_19]: So please keep doing what you're doing.

309
00:31:41,293 --> 00:31:42,595
[SPEAKER_19]: We've clearly taught you well.

310
00:31:43,336 --> 00:31:52,626
[SPEAKER_19]: And I would also say that there's lots of ways to feel regret and to feel like you're getting messages.

311
00:31:52,646 --> 00:31:56,430
[SPEAKER_19]: And some of those feelings can come from unspoken.

312
00:31:57,935 --> 00:32:07,382
[SPEAKER_19]: comments or unspoken body language, and others can come from actual direct communication that has made you feel that way.

313
00:32:07,882 --> 00:32:18,730
[SPEAKER_19]: And what I would encourage you all to do is that if there are things being directly spoken to you that make you feel like you are being penalized, I would ask you to think about

314
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:32,728
[SPEAKER_19]: coming forward to either Superintendent Edouard-Vincent or Superintendent Diane Caldwell, Assistant Superintendent Diane Caldwell, and to make sure that they understand where that's coming from so that if there is a systemic issue, we can address it.

315
00:32:36,193 --> 00:32:36,714
[SPEAKER_27]: Member Ruseau.

316
00:32:38,345 --> 00:32:52,214
[SPEAKER_34]: I just would like to quickly point out, though, that when we have our committee of the whole, the only moment we will be talking in executive session is when we are discussing something that is allowed, and we will not also talk about other stuff.

317
00:32:52,955 --> 00:32:54,036
[SPEAKER_34]: That's a really important point.

318
00:32:54,076 --> 00:33:04,823
[SPEAKER_34]: We can't go into executive session to discuss employees that perhaps are under a contract and then also talk about employees that are not under a contract.

319
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:20,568
[SPEAKER_34]: we have to literally divide our conversation very clearly, so there won't be any like, you come into the room, we're talking, we're gonna go to executive session, and we come out and we've talked about you or what this topic.

320
00:33:20,628 --> 00:33:25,611
[SPEAKER_34]: So it's really important to note that executive session has very strict rules that we

321
00:33:26,294 --> 00:33:30,497
[SPEAKER_34]: have to always kind of enforce with each other, like, no, you can't talk about that.

322
00:33:31,398 --> 00:33:37,003
[SPEAKER_34]: We really do that, because the law is very explicit about what we can and cannot talk about in those meetings.

323
00:33:38,164 --> 00:33:44,108
[SPEAKER_34]: So I do think the committee of the whole, obviously, I would make a motion to approve this.

324
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:54,897
[SPEAKER_34]: But if we do have executive session portion, which we may have to have, because if there's an effect on employees with a contract, we can't discuss that in the public.

325
00:33:56,655 --> 00:33:58,016
[SPEAKER_34]: it won't be most of the meeting.

326
00:33:58,136 --> 00:33:59,378
[SPEAKER_34]: You definitely want to stick around.

327
00:34:00,739 --> 00:34:06,686
[SPEAKER_27]: Motion for approval by Member Ruseau, seconded by Member Kreatz.

328
00:34:06,867 --> 00:34:07,648
[SPEAKER_27]: All those in favor?

329
00:34:07,668 --> 00:34:08,208
[SPEAKER_27]: Aye.

330
00:34:08,469 --> 00:34:10,631
[SPEAKER_27]: All those opposed?

331
00:34:11,432 --> 00:34:11,873
[SPEAKER_27]: Superintendent?

332
00:34:13,911 --> 00:34:25,373
[SPEAKER_32]: And I just want to address our students and say that yes, we definitely, Medford Public Schools really endorses and believes strongly in leadership skills.

333
00:34:27,094 --> 00:34:35,415
[SPEAKER_32]: The teacher in me was listening to your persuasive arguments and how well written and how wonderfully you all presented this evening.

334
00:34:36,196 --> 00:34:38,976
[SPEAKER_32]: And again, advocacy is truly important.

335
00:34:39,116 --> 00:34:42,817
[SPEAKER_32]: It's an important skill that we want to continue to develop in all of our students.

336
00:34:43,717 --> 00:35:03,422
[SPEAKER_32]: And again, we will take everything that was said this evening and the previous meetings that have already taken place and moving forward with the future committee of the whole to truly reflect on everything and address many of the concerns that were said this morning.

337
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:22,492
[SPEAKER_32]: I do not want anyone leaving here thinking that we do not support and encourage student advocacy and leadership skills and that is definitely a strong skill set that is developed in Medford and I want to see more of that skill set developed.

338
00:35:22,892 --> 00:35:24,132
[SPEAKER_32]: I also want to thank Ms.

339
00:35:24,152 --> 00:35:24,933
[SPEAKER_32]: Donlin for

340
00:35:25,993 --> 00:35:34,999
[SPEAKER_32]: sharing and also being a courageous teacher to come up and share with us this evening, you know, her thoughts and the information that she had.

341
00:35:35,439 --> 00:35:36,179
[SPEAKER_32]: So thank you.

342
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,461
[SPEAKER_32]: And thank you to parents for supporting their children.

343
00:35:40,262 --> 00:35:43,364
[SPEAKER_32]: This is a wonderful family community and engagement.

344
00:35:43,684 --> 00:35:44,064
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

345
00:35:44,744 --> 00:35:45,045
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

346
00:35:46,526 --> 00:35:47,186
[SPEAKER_27]: Member McLaughlin.

347
00:35:48,377 --> 00:35:54,484
[SPEAKER_24]: Just another point of clarification, I'm wondering how the students will be informed of the committee of the whole meeting date.

348
00:35:55,505 --> 00:35:59,629
[SPEAKER_24]: They are posted online, but that means you have to go and look and check online.

349
00:35:59,689 --> 00:36:05,295
[SPEAKER_24]: Is there a way that we can push information to the students and to the after school program about the date?

350
00:36:05,595 --> 00:36:06,576
[SPEAKER_32]: Once it's scheduled, yes.

351
00:36:07,096 --> 00:36:08,258
[SPEAKER_32]: I can actually work with Ms.

352
00:36:08,278 --> 00:36:09,199
[SPEAKER_32]: Donlin as well.

353
00:36:09,479 --> 00:36:09,819
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

354
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:10,420
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

355
00:36:13,556 --> 00:36:19,020
[SPEAKER_18]: While we heard from students involved in the after school program, we have other students who work for us.

356
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:24,704
[SPEAKER_18]: And it would only be equitable to understand the full breadth of student employees.

357
00:36:26,705 --> 00:36:28,507
[SPEAKER_18]: For instance, we have students who are lifeguards.

358
00:36:28,527 --> 00:36:31,369
[SPEAKER_18]: That's part of the motion.

359
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:39,735
[SPEAKER_27]: That all those paid under minimum wage, we get a tally of that, how much that's going to cost to

360
00:36:40,276 --> 00:36:40,636
[SPEAKER_27]: increase.

361
00:36:40,877 --> 00:36:41,637
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

362
00:36:42,898 --> 00:36:45,541
[SPEAKER_27]: Motion for approval has been passed.

363
00:36:46,061 --> 00:36:47,442
[SPEAKER_27]: Motion approval set.

364
00:36:48,083 --> 00:36:48,303
[SPEAKER_27]: Thanks.

365
00:36:49,024 --> 00:37:04,798
[SPEAKER_27]: While we're under suspension, we have Toni Wray in the audience for an update from the nursing department.

366
00:37:12,426 --> 00:37:20,009
[SPEAKER_07]: information coming out of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and the CDC around the coronavirus.

367
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:28,793
[SPEAKER_07]: I have some handouts.

368
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:29,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

369
00:37:29,573 --> 00:37:32,934
[SPEAKER_07]: We are continuing to monitor this information very closely.

370
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:41,538
[SPEAKER_07]: This morning, Mary Ann O'Connor, who is the director of the Medford Board of Health, Janet Leahy, who is a public health nurse,

371
00:37:41,889 --> 00:37:48,110
[SPEAKER_07]: and myself participated in a teleconference with the officials from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.

372
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:56,831
[SPEAKER_07]: At this time, they informed us that the risk for Massachusetts citizens to become ill with the coronavirus is very low.

373
00:37:59,072 --> 00:38:11,634
[SPEAKER_07]: What we learned from this teleconference this morning, the CDC is conducting screening for illness among passengers who are traveling from China to the United States at 11 designated airports.

374
00:38:13,174 --> 00:38:21,159
[SPEAKER_07]: Travelers who are arriving from the Hubei province will be screened and subject to mandatory quarantine for 14 days.

375
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:36,268
[SPEAKER_07]: Federal officials are advising travelers who arrive from mainland China to the United States anytime after February 2nd, which was yesterday, to self-quarantine at home for 14 days.

376
00:38:36,588 --> 00:38:36,908
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

377
00:38:39,431 --> 00:38:51,921
[SPEAKER_07]: The CDC is monitoring this rapidly changing situation and they provide regular updates through their websites and also to local public health authorities across the nation.

378
00:38:52,381 --> 00:38:57,065
[SPEAKER_07]: There are two links to information that I gave you.

379
00:38:59,383 --> 00:39:00,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Both of them are the handouts.

380
00:39:00,784 --> 00:39:22,525
[SPEAKER_07]: One of them is the novel coronavirus and you, which provides information about the virus and how you can help prevent it, as well as what should the public do, which has some very concrete steps for the public to use to avoid getting the virus.

381
00:39:24,201 --> 00:39:33,726
[SPEAKER_07]: At this time, I have to mention that this is also influenza season, so we are seeing a lot of influenza-like illness in our schools and in the community.

382
00:39:34,727 --> 00:39:46,353
[SPEAKER_07]: School nurses are closely monitoring symptoms from students and reminding parents to keep children home if they are symptomatic with a fever and other signs of influenza.

383
00:39:47,153 --> 00:39:50,435
[SPEAKER_07]: We're also asking people to practice good hand washing and coughing.

384
00:39:51,096 --> 00:39:56,181
[SPEAKER_07]: techniques and these are being enforced with the students in school by the school nurses.

385
00:39:57,542 --> 00:40:06,489
[SPEAKER_07]: Any students who are ill such as having a fever or symptoms are being sent home as a way to contain the infection in the community.

386
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:17,619
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to remind you that students can return to school once they're fever free for 24 hours without medication and as well that there's still time to get a flu vaccine.

387
00:40:20,011 --> 00:40:30,677
[SPEAKER_07]: We also want to reassure you that we are monitoring this situation very closely and staying informed of the latest recommendations out of our public health authorities.

388
00:40:31,117 --> 00:40:34,579
[SPEAKER_07]: And we will continue to share this with you as it unfolds to us.

389
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:36,860
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

390
00:40:37,301 --> 00:40:37,861
[SPEAKER_34]: Member Ruseau.

391
00:40:38,822 --> 00:40:39,662
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you for that report.

392
00:40:39,682 --> 00:40:40,763
[SPEAKER_34]: I really do appreciate it.

393
00:40:43,038 --> 00:40:51,122
[SPEAKER_34]: If somebody's identified as needing quarantine, I presume, or self-quarantine, is Medford notified that this is a resident?

394
00:40:51,922 --> 00:40:52,102
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

395
00:40:53,443 --> 00:40:53,663
[SPEAKER_34]: No.

396
00:40:54,363 --> 00:40:55,564
[SPEAKER_07]: Not to my knowledge, no.

397
00:40:55,964 --> 00:40:56,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Medford meaning?

398
00:40:56,785 --> 00:41:06,689
[SPEAKER_34]: I mean, does the town, wherever the person lives, they get off the plane and they are identified as somebody who does need to be self-quarantined?

399
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:09,851
[SPEAKER_34]: Maybe I don't understand self-quarantine then.

400
00:41:10,382 --> 00:41:21,309
[SPEAKER_07]: They're being given handouts from the CDC screeners at the airports that outlines the steps to be taken and explains what that is.

401
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:26,392
[SPEAKER_07]: I probably shouldn't have jumped to say no, that they're not notified.

402
00:41:26,732 --> 00:41:39,900
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think the local boards of health are notified of those who are self-quarantining, because most of those people may be coming from that region, but they may be likely asymptomatic.

403
00:41:41,403 --> 00:41:44,485
[SPEAKER_34]: And so, but when somebody is quarantined because they're symptomatic.

404
00:41:45,126 --> 00:41:45,666
[SPEAKER_07]: That's different.

405
00:41:46,367 --> 00:41:47,288
[SPEAKER_34]: They don't get to go home.

406
00:41:48,268 --> 00:41:48,509
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

407
00:41:48,629 --> 00:41:49,629
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

408
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:50,410
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

409
00:41:51,291 --> 00:41:56,274
[SPEAKER_07]: At the airports, they're quarantining them on military bases and those type of facilities.

410
00:41:56,675 --> 00:41:56,975
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

411
00:41:58,536 --> 00:41:59,237
[SPEAKER_27]: Member McLaughlin.

412
00:42:00,037 --> 00:42:01,138
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you for your report.

413
00:42:01,158 --> 00:42:01,779
[SPEAKER_24]: You're welcome.

414
00:42:01,999 --> 00:42:02,299
[SPEAKER_24]: Tony.

415
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:07,223
[SPEAKER_24]: I had a question on the communication that you sent out where

416
00:42:07,833 --> 00:42:15,599
[SPEAKER_24]: It says federal officials are advising travelers who arrive in the US after February 2nd from mainland China to self-quarantine at home for 14 days.

417
00:42:15,659 --> 00:42:18,941
[SPEAKER_24]: So this is getting to Member Ruseau's point about the self-quarantine.

418
00:42:20,302 --> 00:42:29,429
[SPEAKER_24]: So do we have any mechanism in our school to understand if we have school community members that have traveled to China in the past 14 days?

419
00:42:31,671 --> 00:42:31,971
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

420
00:42:32,191 --> 00:42:36,114
[SPEAKER_07]: If parents have reported to their administration that they are

421
00:42:36,667 --> 00:42:38,148
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, away for a vacation.

422
00:42:38,569 --> 00:42:43,993
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a really typical time for Chinese families to return for Chinese New Year.

423
00:42:44,674 --> 00:42:46,916
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have people who may be over there on business.

424
00:42:47,016 --> 00:42:50,839
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there's many different reasons people, you know, travel to China.

425
00:42:53,461 --> 00:42:55,523
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes we do, you know, we are aware of that.

426
00:42:57,444 --> 00:43:03,990
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're doing our best to work with those families and provide education so that they understand what constitutes

427
00:43:04,802 --> 00:43:08,624
[SPEAKER_07]: symptomatic and what all of these recommendations mean.

428
00:43:09,144 --> 00:43:16,707
[SPEAKER_24]: And if I understand the correspondence, though, it's whether they're symptomatic or asymptomatic that they're recommending a 14-day self-quarantine.

429
00:43:16,747 --> 00:43:17,627
[SPEAKER_24]: Is that right?

430
00:43:18,667 --> 00:43:19,748
[SPEAKER_24]: Right, asymptomatic.

431
00:43:20,308 --> 00:43:20,548
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

432
00:43:21,528 --> 00:43:23,309
[SPEAKER_24]: And so, but there's no real enforcement of it.

433
00:43:24,149 --> 00:43:24,970
[SPEAKER_24]: Is that accurate?

434
00:43:30,089 --> 00:43:33,211
[SPEAKER_07]: Those that we are aware of, yes, we're monitoring.

435
00:43:33,271 --> 00:43:35,293
[SPEAKER_07]: We're watching that they're staying home.

436
00:43:35,373 --> 00:43:37,174
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we're doing the best we can.

437
00:43:37,374 --> 00:43:38,355
[SPEAKER_24]: Sure, of course.

438
00:43:38,795 --> 00:43:47,581
[SPEAKER_24]: But I mean, there's no, from the public health officials or anything like that, there's no way to track or enforce or anything like that, right?

439
00:43:47,761 --> 00:43:48,802
[SPEAKER_24]: Not to my knowledge.

440
00:43:49,262 --> 00:43:50,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Is Marianne O'Connor still here?

441
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:52,564
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no.

442
00:43:52,885 --> 00:43:54,346
[SPEAKER_24]: And is this more significant?

443
00:43:54,366 --> 00:43:54,646
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know.

444
00:43:55,743 --> 00:44:01,067
[SPEAKER_24]: been watching it all on the news, because sometimes I feel like there can be elements of hysteria to these things, too.

445
00:44:01,127 --> 00:44:03,869
[SPEAKER_24]: But is there... There are a lot of elements to hysteria.

446
00:44:04,689 --> 00:44:07,211
[SPEAKER_24]: Is this different from a typical flu?

447
00:44:08,852 --> 00:44:15,017
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, you're at more risk of contracting the flu right now than you are of contracting coronavirus.

448
00:44:15,157 --> 00:44:15,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

449
00:44:15,597 --> 00:44:25,124
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially influenza B. That seems to be what is being cultured out with people who are symptomatic with flu-like illness symptoms.

450
00:44:26,746 --> 00:44:27,967
[SPEAKER_07]: you're much more at risk of that.

451
00:44:28,027 --> 00:44:33,788
[SPEAKER_07]: And more people in the United States die of influenza than people who have died of coronavirus.

452
00:44:33,908 --> 00:44:34,308
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

453
00:44:34,348 --> 00:44:37,509
[SPEAKER_24]: That helps, I think, with a little bit, perhaps, with the hysteria piece of it.

454
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:43,350
[SPEAKER_24]: And then is the symptomatic, are the symptoms, you know, more severe than the average flu or?

455
00:44:43,790 --> 00:44:46,091
[SPEAKER_24]: They tend to be lower respiratory symptoms.

456
00:44:46,371 --> 00:44:54,033
[SPEAKER_07]: So a deep cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, which is often a little bit different than flu.

457
00:44:54,153 --> 00:44:55,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Flu, you'll have the cough,

458
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:58,462
[SPEAKER_07]: The cough, sneezing, the body aches, the fever.

459
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:05,848
[SPEAKER_07]: But the lower respiratory symptoms seem to be what delineate this from other respiratory illnesses.

460
00:45:05,868 --> 00:45:08,009
[SPEAKER_24]: »» Thank you so much for your expertise.

461
00:45:08,029 --> 00:45:08,490
[SPEAKER_24]: Appreciate it.

462
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:10,171
[SPEAKER_27]: »» Thank you.

463
00:45:10,792 --> 00:45:12,493
[SPEAKER_27]: Motion to receive and place on file?

464
00:45:12,513 --> 00:45:13,854
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay.

465
00:45:14,334 --> 00:45:14,674
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

466
00:45:14,935 --> 00:45:15,415
[SPEAKER_27]: Member Graham.

467
00:45:15,435 --> 00:45:18,938
[SPEAKER_19]: »» Can I just ask one more question before you leave the microphone?

468
00:45:19,518 --> 00:45:19,958
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe two?

469
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:23,561
[SPEAKER_19]: Is Logan one of the 11 designated airports?

470
00:45:23,581 --> 00:45:23,781
[SPEAKER_19]: »» No.

471
00:45:25,328 --> 00:45:49,455
[SPEAKER_19]: And for those families who are returning that we're aware of, I think what I heard you say, and I just want to make sure I understand, is you're attempting to get in touch with those families, making sure they're aware of the federal recommendation that they self-quarantine, but they can choose not to, and they can choose to send their children to school.

472
00:45:49,515 --> 00:45:50,856
[SPEAKER_19]: Is that what I heard?

473
00:45:52,665 --> 00:46:06,748
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, and the word we had from this phone, this teleconference this morning is for children that who are symptomatic, asymptomatic, excuse me, there are no restrictions on their activity.

474
00:46:07,428 --> 00:46:12,009
[SPEAKER_07]: So people are being voluntarily, you know, asked to voluntary self-quarantine.

475
00:46:13,169 --> 00:46:21,171
[SPEAKER_07]: And so... So there's many other communities across the Commonwealth that are in a similar situation as we are.

476
00:46:21,556 --> 00:46:34,186
[SPEAKER_19]: And are they all sort of approaching this the same way, which is it sounds like to make sure the families are aware of the recommendation and then the families make that decision to either send or not?

477
00:46:34,526 --> 00:46:40,911
[SPEAKER_07]: We're all trying to transmit the same message that's coming from the CDC and the local boards of health.

478
00:46:42,172 --> 00:46:47,817
[SPEAKER_19]: And do you have any words of comfort maybe to offer

479
00:46:48,663 --> 00:47:04,670
[SPEAKER_19]: the community that has not traveled to China but hears about, back to the hysteria, but hears about students returning from China who may be attending school, whether that's parents of students or staff or administrators.

480
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:15,595
[SPEAKER_07]: I think what's helpful is looking at when families have returned because the CDC has designated February 2nd

481
00:47:16,656 --> 00:47:20,079
[SPEAKER_07]: as the date for the quarantines to start.

482
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:32,709
[SPEAKER_07]: The further backwards that you came into the country from February 2nd, let's say you came in mid-January or early January, those people are less likely.

483
00:47:33,030 --> 00:47:39,935
[SPEAKER_07]: Their risk of contracting that disease was very low compared to people who are coming, maybe coming in after February 2nd.

484
00:47:40,196 --> 00:47:45,400
[SPEAKER_07]: There's more disease in China right now, and it has been slowly increasing.

485
00:47:46,855 --> 00:47:52,417
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you came in three weeks ago, two weeks ago, one week ago, the risk of your infection was less.

486
00:47:56,859 --> 00:47:57,179
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

487
00:47:57,879 --> 00:48:03,301
[SPEAKER_27]: Motion to receive and place on file by Member Van der Kloot, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

488
00:48:03,521 --> 00:48:04,161
[SPEAKER_27]: All those in favor?

489
00:48:04,762 --> 00:48:05,442
[SPEAKER_27]: All those opposed?

490
00:48:05,902 --> 00:48:11,424
[SPEAKER_27]: Motion to revert back to the regular order of business by Member Van der Kloot, report of secretary.

491
00:48:14,273 --> 00:48:16,354
[SPEAKER_18]: I have several things to bring to your attention.

492
00:48:17,434 --> 00:48:35,681
[SPEAKER_18]: At our last school committee meeting, Member McLaughlin asked, and it was reflected in our minutes, about the conversations with non-English speaking families from the health office, and we talked about a translation service that were used.

493
00:48:36,081 --> 00:48:39,703
[SPEAKER_18]: So I pulled one of the bills so that you could see it.

494
00:48:40,103 --> 00:48:43,304
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to note that the names that are on it are not student names.

495
00:48:43,644 --> 00:48:44,885
[SPEAKER_18]: They are, in fact, the employees.

496
00:48:45,185 --> 00:48:46,966
[SPEAKER_18]: But I thought you would just be interested.

497
00:48:47,026 --> 00:48:52,850
[SPEAKER_18]: You can see that sometimes the conference is only two minutes, and sometimes it's 14 minutes.

498
00:48:53,571 --> 00:48:57,994
[SPEAKER_18]: But this is that we employ a service to help with the translation.

499
00:48:58,074 --> 00:48:59,155
[SPEAKER_18]: So I brought that in.

500
00:48:59,195 --> 00:49:00,336
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to pass them around.

501
00:49:00,396 --> 00:49:04,739
[SPEAKER_18]: And I would ask that they all, they are copies, but if you just return them to me, I'd appreciate it.

502
00:49:05,399 --> 00:49:16,769
[SPEAKER_18]: Secondarily, and this is kind of an ode to my former colleague, our former colleague, Erinda Benedetto, I pulled a bill that was for professional cleaning.

503
00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:23,836
[SPEAKER_18]: Whenever I see professional odor remediation services that piqued my interest so I followed it up.

504
00:49:24,436 --> 00:49:26,158
[SPEAKER_18]: It had to do with the Curtis-Tufts.

505
00:49:26,878 --> 00:49:29,621
[SPEAKER_18]: They had a problem in the library classroom.

506
00:49:30,702 --> 00:49:39,528
[SPEAKER_18]: So on December 26th, when students were not in the building, they brought in ServPro to help remediate that issue.

507
00:49:39,889 --> 00:49:42,611
[SPEAKER_18]: And so you'll see that bill.

508
00:49:43,251 --> 00:49:50,256
[SPEAKER_18]: Lastly, I just thought you might be interested that we have received new textbooks for our students for our civic education in grade 7.

509
00:49:51,537 --> 00:49:53,477
[SPEAKER_18]: And I brought in the bills for you to see that.

510
00:49:53,978 --> 00:50:01,579
[SPEAKER_18]: Unfortunately, much to my dismay, I realized that they are already out of date as I couldn't help but look under impeach.

511
00:50:01,799 --> 00:50:06,040
[SPEAKER_18]: And it mentioned that only, you know, two presidents have been impeached.

512
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:11,561
[SPEAKER_18]: And so, we are obviously, our teachers are going to have to update that information.

513
00:50:11,601 --> 00:50:12,701
[SPEAKER_18]: But there is also a teacher.

514
00:50:12,981 --> 00:50:18,162
[SPEAKER_18]: So, I brought them in just so you could see and know that these resources have been brought to our students.

515
00:50:18,843 --> 00:50:19,123
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

516
00:50:25,492 --> 00:50:27,757
[SPEAKER_27]: Motion for approval of the report?

517
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:29,301
[SPEAKER_27]: Please on file.

518
00:50:30,163 --> 00:50:33,430
[SPEAKER_27]: Motion to receive and place on file by Member Van der Kloot, seconded by Member Kreatz.

519
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:34,152
[SPEAKER_27]: All those in favor?

520
00:50:34,172 --> 00:50:35,294
[SPEAKER_27]: All those opposed?

521
00:50:36,021 --> 00:50:37,741
[SPEAKER_27]: Motion is received and placed on file.

522
00:50:38,802 --> 00:50:39,482
[SPEAKER_18]: One further thing.

523
00:50:40,342 --> 00:50:43,503
[SPEAKER_18]: I just want to extend again an invitation to any other member.

524
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:45,863
[SPEAKER_18]: I've been getting there on Wednesdays about 10, 15.

525
00:50:47,263 --> 00:50:51,884
[SPEAKER_18]: And if anybody does want to join me, if you give me a heads up, then I'll make sure my timing's more exact.

526
00:50:51,944 --> 00:50:56,445
[SPEAKER_18]: But please do feel free to come and join on Wednesdays up at the high school.

527
00:50:57,445 --> 00:50:57,625
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

528
00:50:57,645 --> 00:50:57,966
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

529
00:50:59,046 --> 00:51:01,406
[SPEAKER_27]: We have community participation.

530
00:51:04,027 --> 00:51:05,027
[SPEAKER_27]: Hearing and seeing none.

531
00:51:06,499 --> 00:51:07,759
[SPEAKER_27]: report of superintendent.

532
00:51:14,802 --> 00:51:15,742
[SPEAKER_32]: Good evening, everyone.

533
00:51:18,043 --> 00:51:24,386
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm pleased to announce that last Friday, the Medford Public Schools unveiled its brand new website.

534
00:51:25,646 --> 00:51:27,787
[SPEAKER_32]: The former website was developed in 2007.

535
00:51:27,867 --> 00:51:30,688
[SPEAKER_32]: Over the course of the past two years,

536
00:51:33,559 --> 00:51:52,183
[SPEAKER_32]: Allison Goldsberry, our webmaster, has been very busy, diligently researching other school system websites, discussing what works as well as what doesn't work with different focus groups, which included staff, parents, and students.

537
00:51:53,463 --> 00:52:02,425
[SPEAKER_32]: She worked both with Tufts University students and our own vocational media students to put together a comprehensive

538
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:05,393
[SPEAKER_32]: more visual, and user-friendly site.

539
00:52:06,714 --> 00:52:17,527
[SPEAKER_32]: As we are all aware, a website is a constant work in progress, but we feel the new site is very welcoming and helps to address many more of our needs.

540
00:52:18,548 --> 00:52:22,232
[SPEAKER_32]: We encourage everyone to visit it and let us know what you think.

541
00:52:23,308 --> 00:52:38,542
[SPEAKER_32]: I'd like to thank Allison Goldsberry, our webmaster, Tufts University students, and our own vocational media technology students for all of their time, hard work, efforts in updating the new website.

542
00:52:40,979 --> 00:52:46,403
[SPEAKER_32]: As we just heard, I want to just highlight again the important health update on coronavirus.

543
00:52:46,883 --> 00:52:58,091
[SPEAKER_32]: And I want to just thank our nursing director, Toni Wray, supervisor of health services for Medford Public Schools for presenting that timely information to the community this evening.

544
00:53:00,569 --> 00:53:24,071
[SPEAKER_32]: Additionally, I want to recognize Team Medford, Maryann O'Connor, and I know your Chief of Staff, Mr. Rodriguez, and the Nursing Director here, Janet Leahy, for working collaboratively with Medford Public Schools to come up with an official, formal response as a city.

545
00:53:25,728 --> 00:53:31,433
[SPEAKER_32]: Moving along, I want to recognize some of our CCSR students at the McGlynn Middle School.

546
00:53:33,074 --> 00:53:36,177
[SPEAKER_32]: McGlynn Middle School was recently featured on Channel 4.

547
00:53:37,779 --> 00:53:41,762
[SPEAKER_32]: The program, The Lookup Challenge, does just that.

548
00:53:42,142 --> 00:53:52,632
[SPEAKER_32]: It challenges students to put down their phones and head out to play, read a good book, or just have a conversation with family and friends.

549
00:53:53,991 --> 00:54:03,037
[SPEAKER_32]: Look Up Live is a non-profit startup whose mission is to support youth design solutions for technology and real life balance.

550
00:54:04,218 --> 00:54:16,626
[SPEAKER_32]: Since before the holiday vacation, McGlynn Middle School students have been challenged to reflect upon how they can take a more balanced approach with their use of technology.

551
00:54:17,253 --> 00:54:29,604
[SPEAKER_32]: In addition to that, this project was funded by the Cummings Foundation and the Crystal Campbell Community Betterment Fund, so we would like to thank them also for their continued support of Medford Public Schools.

552
00:54:31,186 --> 00:54:39,854
[SPEAKER_32]: I also want to thank Brookline Bank and Members Plus Credit Union for their introduction to financial literacy.

555
00:54:52,019 --> 00:55:04,243
[SPEAKER_32]: They engaged students in discussions on topics related to personal finance while making important connections with math in the classroom to their everyday lives.

556
00:55:05,244 --> 00:55:08,625
[SPEAKER_32]: The bankers intend on making this an annual event.

572
00:57:12,202 --> 00:57:24,385
[SPEAKER_32]: The girls team just finished and they were at eight and two, but actually since they just won the game this evening, they played against Everett and the girls won this evening, 34-32.

573
00:57:25,065 --> 00:57:27,165
[SPEAKER_32]: That would have been a nail biter.

574
00:57:27,185 --> 00:57:29,166
[SPEAKER_32]: A great game to have watched.

575
00:57:29,206 --> 00:57:33,467

[SPEAKER_32]: Tristan Howard, our own Mustang,

580
00:58:04,042 --> 00:58:08,858

581
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:20,862

582
00:58:21,402 --> 00:58:23,422
[SPEAKER_32]: They finished together in a dead heat.

583
00:58:23,722 --> 00:58:35,505
[SPEAKER_32]: So the people who were at Reggie Lewis said it was another nail-biter, fascinating, exciting race, but just wonderful things that are happening with our own Mustangs.

584
00:58:37,496 --> 00:58:44,622

597
00:59:34,890 --> 00:59:38,753

598
00:59:39,294 --> 00:59:43,277
[SPEAKER_32]: The Columbus School participated in Pennies for Patients.

599
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:47,842
[SPEAKER_32]: which raises money for Leukemia Society.

600
00:59:49,142 --> 00:59:50,863
[SPEAKER_32]: And the Columbus School collected $3,336.59.

601
00:59:50,903 --> 00:59:54,445

602
00:59:54,465 --> 00:59:59,687
[SPEAKER_32]: Her classroom alone raised $936 in pennies, which is truly outstanding for the school.

[SPEAKER_32]: They were awarded a pizza party from the Leukemia Society for their outstanding efforts.

604
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:25,359
[SPEAKER_32]: And we want to say a special thank you to Assistant Principal Nancy Sherman Hudson, who led this important fundraising event.

605
01:00:25,939 --> 01:00:27,640
[SPEAKER_32]: Great job, Columbus School.

606
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:29,200
[SPEAKER_32]: Please keep up the good work.

607
01:00:31,001 --> 01:00:32,481
[SPEAKER_32]: So at the beginning of January,

624
01:03:33,459 --> 01:03:43,507
[SPEAKER_32]: Medford has had a number of students receive honorable mentions, but being named gold and silver key winners is a great honor.

631
01:04:22,201 --> 01:04:22,741
[SPEAKER_32]: Last week,

632
01:04:23,385 --> 01:04:27,806
[SPEAKER_32]: I had the opportunity to participate in cookies in Convo at the high school.

633
01:04:28,626 --> 01:04:40,688
[SPEAKER_32]: And I just had an opportunity to connect with staff and teachers during their lunch break over cookies and just talk and hear feedback and just have wonderful conversation.

634
01:04:41,388 --> 01:04:45,389
[SPEAKER_32]: And I look forward to spreading that out to additional schools.

635
01:04:45,869 --> 01:04:51,070
[SPEAKER_32]: But I was very pleased with the teachers who were able to avail themselves to participate in that.

636
01:04:52,321 --> 01:05:07,292
[SPEAKER_32]: Additionally, earlier today, I had the opportunity to be with Global Scholars, which is one of our special programs that runs at the middle school levels, along with Dr. Riccardelli, our Director of Curriculum.

637
01:05:07,993 --> 01:05:19,622
[SPEAKER_32]: We were able to look at instruction, teachers got to talk and really listen to students during their student panel, getting feedback from eighth graders on what they thought were the strengths

638
01:05:20,362 --> 01:05:25,110
[SPEAKER_32]: and suggestions for how that special program can continue to improve.

639
01:05:25,631 --> 01:05:30,278
[SPEAKER_32]: And so that was a wonderful opportunity that happened just earlier today.

[SPEAKER_32]: For anyone who may want to join the volunteer crew, we're looking for interested parties.

642
01:05:57,128 --> 01:06:05,710

657
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:35,644
[SPEAKER_10]: Since the casino just opened last summer, this is the first time the city has made awards based on the surrounding community agreement.

658
01:07:36,085 --> 01:07:40,627
[SPEAKER_10]: And we want to do this in a legal and in transparent way.

659
01:07:41,547 --> 01:07:44,589
[SPEAKER_10]: So if everybody, we really appreciate your patience.

01:09:29,576 --> 01:09:34,500
[SPEAKER_14]: The SBE manual is Mustang Travels at states this year.

691
01:09:34,741 --> 01:09:40,105
[SPEAKER_14]: The SBE manual has won states and internationals in the previous year.

692
01:09:41,485 --> 01:09:45,428
[SPEAKER_14]: Mustang Travels is managed by students.

693
01:09:46,388 --> 01:09:47,869
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a service for teachers.

694
01:09:49,030 --> 01:09:57,396
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a easier and affordable process to rent vehicles for field trips.

695
01:09:58,196 --> 01:10:01,739
[SPEAKER_14]: And it will soon be available for surrounding Medford Public Schools.

696
01:10:03,849 --> 01:10:04,169
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

697
01:10:04,229 --> 01:10:04,629
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

698
01:10:05,450 --> 01:10:12,412
[SPEAKER_06]: So in a nutshell, we have school vans that we rent out to the community for field trips or for other schools.

699
01:10:12,452 --> 01:10:14,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes the middle schools will borrow some vans.

700
01:10:14,613 --> 01:10:17,815
[SPEAKER_06]: And these guys came up with a plan to have it almost like a rental agency.

701
01:10:18,555 --> 01:10:21,736
[SPEAKER_06]: So the manual that they created for this before has won in previous years.

702
01:10:22,216 --> 01:10:23,817
[SPEAKER_06]: So they'll be competing on this at the state level.

703
01:10:23,937 --> 01:10:27,498
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're seeking approval for the hotel and the registration costs.

704
01:10:28,239 --> 01:10:28,419
[SPEAKER_27]: Great.

705
01:10:29,919 --> 01:10:31,060
[SPEAKER_27]: Motion for approval by?

706
01:10:32,048 --> 01:10:34,509
[SPEAKER_27]: Member Van der Kloot, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

707
01:10:35,169 --> 01:10:35,669
[SPEAKER_27]: Member Kreatz.

708
01:10:36,209 --> 01:10:42,390
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I just wanted to say, you know, thank you for bringing this report and thank you for coming out and explaining that.

709
01:10:42,891 --> 01:11:01,555
[SPEAKER_10]: I did, and the superintendent answered already, I did have a question like who was going to be competing and she explained it was like the various different programs, the automotive and the, I forget where my list went, but so that answered my other question and I just want to wish the students good luck and I hope to hear

710
01:11:02,202 --> 01:11:04,624
[SPEAKER_10]: and hear back from you after the competition.

711
01:11:05,665 --> 01:11:06,085
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

712
01:11:06,105 --> 01:11:07,746
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.

713
01:11:08,327 --> 01:11:08,807
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll be going.

714
01:11:08,867 --> 01:11:09,408
[SPEAKER_10]: I've never been.

715
01:11:10,028 --> 01:11:12,270
[SPEAKER_27]: Through the chair, how many days is the competition?

716
01:11:12,870 --> 01:11:15,052
[SPEAKER_06]: Thursday night, Friday night, the awards are Saturday.

717
01:11:15,592 --> 01:11:17,374
[SPEAKER_27]: So they stay two nights in a hotel.

718
01:11:17,394 --> 01:11:20,116
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

719
01:11:21,417 --> 01:11:21,777
[SPEAKER_27]: Good luck.

720
01:11:21,997 --> 01:11:22,377
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

721
01:11:22,417 --> 01:11:22,778
[SPEAKER_27]: Good luck.

722
01:11:24,479 --> 01:11:26,000
[SPEAKER_27]: Motion for approval.

723
01:11:27,601 --> 01:11:27,882
[SPEAKER_27]: All set.

724
01:11:28,581 --> 01:11:33,144
[SPEAKER_27]: Number four, recommendation to approve donation to Medford Vocational Technical High School.

725
01:11:40,830 --> 01:11:41,190
[SPEAKER_28]: Field trip.

726
01:11:41,570 --> 01:11:42,291
[SPEAKER_28]: Field trip.

727
01:11:44,232 --> 01:11:44,973
[SPEAKER_28]: We did, I believe.

728
01:11:45,813 --> 01:11:46,154
[SPEAKER_28]: We did.

729
01:11:46,174 --> 01:11:49,136
[SPEAKER_28]: A roll call for the field trip.

730
01:11:50,277 --> 01:11:50,957
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Graham.

731
01:11:51,417 --> 01:11:51,618
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

732
01:11:51,878 --> 01:11:52,478
[SPEAKER_18]: Member Franks.

733
01:11:52,638 --> 01:11:52,879
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

734
01:11:53,159 --> 01:11:54,720
[SPEAKER_18]: Member McLaughlin.

735
01:11:54,780 --> 01:11:55,040
Yes.

736
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:56,341
Member Mustone.

737
01:11:56,461 --> 01:11:56,641
Yes.

738
01:11:56,701 --> 01:11:57,102
Member Ruseau.

739
01:11:57,242 --> 01:11:57,382
Yes.

740
01:11:59,744 --> 01:12:00,004
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes.

741
01:12:03,026 --> 01:12:05,207
[SPEAKER_27]: All in favor and none in the negative, paper passes.

742
01:12:06,047 --> 01:12:09,869
[SPEAKER_27]: Now number four, recommendation to approve donation to Medford Vocational Technical High School.

743
01:12:10,836 --> 01:12:11,336
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, again.

744
01:12:11,396 --> 01:12:22,658
[SPEAKER_06]: So Steve Nardone, a Medford Vocational Technical High School graduate from the class of 1979, a longtime friend of the school and a successful business owner in the area, has donated some equipment to our program.

745
01:12:22,718 --> 01:12:27,439
[SPEAKER_06]: This isn't the first time, but this is one of the largest donations in a while.

746
01:12:27,499 --> 01:12:31,840
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's worth Adam explaining a little bit more to you about what it is.

747
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:33,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Adam Burns, electrical instructor.

748
01:12:34,181 --> 01:12:35,221
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, my name is Adam Burns.

749
01:12:35,241 --> 01:12:38,802
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm one of the electrical instructors at Medford Vocational Technical High School.

750
01:12:40,064 --> 01:12:43,645
[SPEAKER_05]: The equipment that was donated is in three pieces.

751
01:12:43,785 --> 01:12:45,025
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll go smallest to largest.

752
01:12:45,386 --> 01:12:53,728
[SPEAKER_05]: Smallest is a cordless bandsaw, which the students used to cut steel members and conduit and pipe with.

753
01:12:54,708 --> 01:13:05,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Next up is a seven-foot, 60-position Cat6 rack, which is used to terminate network wiring.

754
01:13:08,442 --> 01:13:14,984
[SPEAKER_05]: The third is the largest is a firearm system that is up to date.

755
01:13:15,024 --> 01:13:15,724
[SPEAKER_05]: It's addressable.

756
01:13:16,464 --> 01:13:19,125
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more advanced than is in most buildings.

757
01:13:20,205 --> 01:13:29,467
[SPEAKER_05]: It was custom made by Nardone Electric and it is mounted on a portable system where students can create

758
01:13:31,297 --> 01:13:38,604
[SPEAKER_05]: addressable firearm systems which are computer controlled and they also send signals out to the fire department.

759
01:13:39,184 --> 01:13:45,189
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's all a big system and each component is addressable.

760
01:13:45,229 --> 01:13:48,092
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have a whole system plus a lot of components for that.

761
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:53,517
[SPEAKER_05]: And hopefully we're gonna start using it soon.

762
01:14:01,420 --> 01:14:02,081
[SPEAKER_27]: Member Ruseau.

763
01:14:04,543 --> 01:14:05,263
[SPEAKER_34]: This is amazing.

764
01:14:05,424 --> 01:14:10,148
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm looking at this stuff thinking, like, can we get that in our school?

765
01:14:10,208 --> 01:14:11,989
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm sure we need more than one, though, for our school.

766
01:14:12,009 --> 01:14:17,134
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they looked at the system for the school buildings, the older school buildings, and it's extremely expensive.

767
01:14:17,254 --> 01:14:19,136
[SPEAKER_34]: That's what I was going to imagine.

768
01:14:19,836 --> 01:14:21,398
[SPEAKER_34]: So I would certainly motion to approve this.

769
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:24,115
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Kreatz.

770
01:14:24,675 --> 01:14:24,896
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

771
01:14:25,696 --> 01:14:37,680
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just wanted to know, so the state-of-the-art fire alarm control panel, so does that, like, are the students going to be learning, like, you know, where they can detect where a fire might be or, yeah, that's what I thought.

772
01:14:37,700 --> 01:14:44,043
[SPEAKER_10]: So, like, it will, like, identify, like, where, like, the location of the fire and then pin it off to the fire department?

773
01:14:44,323 --> 01:14:44,743
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

774
01:14:44,803 --> 01:14:48,125
[SPEAKER_05]: So in an older system, like in this building, you have zones.

775
01:14:48,445 --> 01:14:49,525
[SPEAKER_05]: This room would be a zone.

776
01:14:50,505 --> 01:14:51,386
[SPEAKER_05]: In newer systems, each,

777
01:14:52,523 --> 01:14:53,764
[SPEAKER_05]: detector is addressable.

778
01:14:54,804 --> 01:15:02,048
[SPEAKER_05]: So each detector can not only tell if there's a fire, it can also tell if it's in trouble.

779
01:15:03,189 --> 01:15:05,270
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone may be tampered with it or if it needs servicing.

780
01:15:06,212 --> 01:15:09,595
[SPEAKER_05]: So the fire department knows exactly which detector to go to.

781
01:15:10,335 --> 01:15:14,819
[SPEAKER_05]: So say they're going to the electrical shop, and the old system would be the electrical shop.

782
01:15:15,419 --> 01:15:16,700
[SPEAKER_05]: So they would have to find it.

783
01:15:17,201 --> 01:15:21,324
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, they would get a signal that would tell them exactly where to go in that building.

784
01:15:21,745 --> 01:15:24,567
[SPEAKER_05]: So that saves time and saves lives eventually.

785
01:15:25,219 --> 01:15:27,240
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep, and that's just, it's amazing.

786
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:32,903
[SPEAKER_10]: And thank you very much to the Nadon electrical support and for their support.

787
01:15:33,043 --> 01:15:34,564
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's just, it is incredible.

788
01:15:34,904 --> 01:15:37,326
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just thought it was incredible myself.

789
01:15:37,426 --> 01:15:40,968
[SPEAKER_10]: And what does the data rack do?

790
01:15:40,988 --> 01:15:44,410
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, is that like a, like I'm not sure what that is either.

791
01:15:44,490 --> 01:15:44,990
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, yeah.

792
01:15:45,010 --> 01:15:53,275
[SPEAKER_05]: So in a building, every single data port where every single person plugs in their computer or Wi-Fi port,

793
01:15:54,815 --> 01:15:59,318
[SPEAKER_05]: That is connected to a cable that has to run back to a server.

794
01:16:00,059 --> 01:16:03,501
[SPEAKER_05]: So every single cable on a floor will run back to one server.

795
01:16:04,482 --> 01:16:07,965
[SPEAKER_05]: And those cables have to be punched down to a rack.

796
01:16:08,025 --> 01:16:12,968
[SPEAKER_05]: So it looks sort of like an old-fashioned operating switchboard where you see a lot of plugs.

797
01:16:14,189 --> 01:16:18,232
[SPEAKER_05]: And what this does is it connects the users to the servers in the building.

798
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:22,221
[SPEAKER_05]: Every building has them.

799
01:16:23,001 --> 01:16:38,170
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is very important now, even though it's not in our frameworks, our advisory board has recommended that our kids learn this stuff, because every single light fixture, from now to the future, forever, is going to be cloud-based computer controlled.

800
01:16:38,790 --> 01:16:45,995
[SPEAKER_05]: So they need, this stuff is not only for data, it's also for lights, fire alarm, cameras, everything.

801
01:16:46,055 --> 01:16:48,256
[SPEAKER_05]: So these electricians have to know this.

802
01:16:49,780 --> 01:16:50,503
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very interesting.

803
01:16:50,543 --> 01:16:51,285
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

804
01:16:51,305 --> 01:16:51,807
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

805
01:16:55,409 --> 01:16:56,270
[SPEAKER_27]: What are these things?

806
01:16:57,531 --> 01:17:04,000
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I just I really didn't know and I didn't Google because I thought I would ask and find out from the experts Thank you very much.

806
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,000
[SPEAKER_27]: member Van der Kloot?

806
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:21,508
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd like to say thank you to Mr. Nardone and ask that we send out a letter to him I know that I've seen his name for many years giving us different different things and and donations so very appreciative to him. Thank you.

807
01:17:24,124 --> 01:17:25,925
[SPEAKER_18]: We need to do a roll call vote to accept this.

808
01:17:25,965 --> 01:17:31,230
[SPEAKER_27]: Motion for approval by him.

809
01:17:31,270 --> 01:17:32,331
[SPEAKER_27]: Seconded by Member Kreatz.

810
01:17:32,411 --> 01:17:33,111
[SPEAKER_27]: Roll call vote.

811
01:17:34,392 --> 01:17:34,973
[SPEAKER_18]: Member Graham.

812
01:17:35,733 --> 01:17:36,354
[SPEAKER_18]: Member Kreatz.

813
01:17:36,994 --> 01:17:37,815
[SPEAKER_18]: Member McLaughlin.

814
01:17:38,475 --> 01:17:39,176
[SPEAKER_18]: Member Mustone.

815
01:17:39,796 --> 01:17:40,497
[SPEAKER_18]: Member Ruseau.

816
01:17:40,997 --> 01:17:41,718
[SPEAKER_18]: Member Van der Kloot.

817
01:17:41,778 --> 01:17:42,058
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

818
01:17:42,118 --> 01:17:43,259
[SPEAKER_18]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn.

819
01:17:43,519 --> 01:17:43,780
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes.

820
01:17:45,381 --> 01:17:47,022
[SPEAKER_27]: All in favor and opposed.

821
01:17:47,322 --> 01:17:48,043
[SPEAKER_27]: Paper passes.

822
01:17:48,543 --> 01:17:51,846
[SPEAKER_27]: Number five, recommendation to approve donation from Exxon Mobil.

823
01:17:52,264 --> 01:17:52,404
[SPEAKER_27]: Ms.

824
01:17:52,424 --> 01:17:53,304
[SPEAKER_27]: Christine Patterson.

825
01:17:53,565 --> 01:17:54,405
[SPEAKER_27]: Good evening, thank you.

826
01:17:54,865 --> 01:18:09,331
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, so this is a unique circumstance whereby one of our business partners, the Medford Square Mobile Gas Station, submitted a nomination through the ExxonMobil Education Alliance Grant for Medford High School.

827
01:18:09,951 --> 01:18:18,995
[SPEAKER_22]: So I was contacted by the Global Partners Territory Manager that we had been selected through this nomination to receive a $500 grant

828
01:18:21,161 --> 01:18:23,023
[SPEAKER_22]: for Medford High School purposes.

829
01:18:23,603 --> 01:18:36,015
[SPEAKER_22]: So there is a slight additional piece of paperwork that's required for Global Partners to be able to provide and distribute that grant if we do choose to accept it.

830
01:18:36,635 --> 01:18:44,923
[SPEAKER_22]: So the recommendation is to accept the generous donation and to send a thank you letter to Medford Square Mobile Station for its nomination.

831
01:18:45,504 --> 01:18:45,764
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

832
01:18:45,824 --> 01:18:46,144
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

833
01:18:46,344 --> 01:18:46,845
[SPEAKER_22]: Member Kreatz.

834
01:18:48,857 --> 01:18:49,877
[SPEAKER_10]: I just had a quick question.

835
01:18:49,937 --> 01:18:54,218
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to know now, can this award be used for anything?

836
01:18:54,878 --> 01:18:58,319
[SPEAKER_10]: Are there any plans for the award, what they're going to use it for?

837
01:18:58,339 --> 01:19:00,000
[SPEAKER_10]: I did look through it, and I wasn't sure.

838
01:19:00,020 --> 01:19:04,561
[SPEAKER_10]: It says something in math and science for higher education.

839
01:19:04,581 --> 01:19:07,401
[SPEAKER_10]: So I wasn't sure if it was going to a certain department, or was it?

840
01:19:07,421 --> 01:19:16,484
[SPEAKER_22]: No, so this would be a general school donation that we would identify through the math and science departments that that was the stipulation of this grant.

841
01:19:16,844 --> 01:19:17,884
[SPEAKER_22]: We have not earmarked it.

842
01:19:18,368 --> 01:19:21,230
[SPEAKER_22]: as of yet, prior to acceptance.

843
01:19:21,930 --> 01:19:22,290
Thank you.

844
01:19:24,411 --> 01:19:26,272
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm assuming roll call vote is required.

845
01:19:26,672 --> 01:19:32,855
[SPEAKER_27]: Motion for approval by Member Graham, seconded by Member Van der Kloot.

846
01:19:33,576 --> 01:19:35,337
[SPEAKER_27]: Roll call vote is required.

847
01:19:35,557 --> 01:19:36,097
[SPEAKER_18]: Member Graham?

848
01:19:36,117 --> 01:19:36,737
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

849
01:19:36,757 --> 01:19:37,318
[SPEAKER_18]: Member Kreatz?

850
01:19:37,658 --> 01:19:37,798
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

851
01:19:38,058 --> 01:19:38,878
[SPEAKER_18]: Member McLaughlin?

852
01:19:39,579 --> 01:19:39,639
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

853
01:19:39,659 --> 01:19:40,279
[SPEAKER_18]: Member Mustone?

854
01:19:40,299 --> 01:19:40,899
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

855
01:19:40,919 --> 01:19:41,520
[SPEAKER_18]: Member Ruseau?

856
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:41,620
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

857
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:43,061
[SPEAKER_18]: Member Van der Kloot, yes.

858
01:19:43,401 --> 01:19:44,521
[SPEAKER_18]: Member Lungo-Koehn?

859
01:19:44,541 --> 01:19:44,641
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

860
01:19:44,661 --> 01:19:45,342
[SPEAKER_18]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn.

861
01:19:46,147 --> 01:19:48,769
[SPEAKER_27]: All those in favor and on the negative, paper passes.

862
01:19:49,210 --> 01:19:52,072
[SPEAKER_27]: Number six, report on personnel activity.

863
01:19:52,112 --> 01:19:52,272
[SPEAKER_27]: Ms.

864
01:19:52,292 --> 01:19:53,153
[SPEAKER_27]: Christine Patterson.

865
01:19:53,253 --> 01:19:53,713
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

866
01:19:54,614 --> 01:20:04,502
[SPEAKER_22]: Again, provided just for your awareness is an activity report for this fiscal year beginning July 1st of 2019.

867
01:20:04,822 --> 01:20:13,449
[SPEAKER_22]: And it was current through the January 30th timeframe prior to sending out this packet.

868
01:20:14,229 --> 01:20:26,534
[SPEAKER_22]: I think it's noteworthy to indicate, and I want to thank the business center team, human resources and payroll for processing all of these.

869
01:20:26,714 --> 01:20:30,856
[SPEAKER_22]: As you hear the number of activity, it's quite significant.

870
01:20:30,976 --> 01:20:42,801
[SPEAKER_22]: So the team has onboarded 185 new hires, and that was not including additional pending hires that have not finalized all of their requirements to be entered into payroll.

871
01:20:43,246 --> 01:20:49,930
[SPEAKER_22]: So we've had a significant amount of onboarding, which this is for all employee groups.

872
01:20:49,990 --> 01:21:02,438
[SPEAKER_22]: So this is not just identifying teachers and paras, this is, these are daily subs, these are after school program workers, all categories, 185 new hires.

873
01:21:03,258 --> 01:21:09,322
[SPEAKER_22]: In addition to the new hires, we've processed 38 retirements and or resignations through the district.

874
01:21:10,407 --> 01:21:25,654
[SPEAKER_22]: We've also had significant activity with a total of 61 cases of long-term illnesses, full-year leaves of absence, and workers' compensation cases, of which those we've had to provide additional staffing.

875
01:21:25,714 --> 01:21:35,239
[SPEAKER_22]: So the 185 is also a result of some of this activity based on full-year leaves and long-term leaves.

876
01:21:35,299 --> 01:21:38,000
[SPEAKER_22]: So we still need to cover classrooms, we need to cover

877
01:21:38,427 --> 01:21:43,708
[SPEAKER_22]: the other functions throughout the district when an individual is on said leave.

878
01:21:44,168 --> 01:21:56,832
[SPEAKER_22]: So we have had significant activity and I believe this report is just for your review.

879
01:21:57,832 --> 01:21:58,172
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

880
01:21:58,512 --> 01:21:58,992
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Kreatz.

881
01:21:59,312 --> 01:22:02,593
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I just had a quick question because I know this question comes up a lot.

882
01:22:03,393 --> 01:22:06,194
[SPEAKER_10]: What is the difference between a long-term substitute

883
01:22:06,661 --> 01:22:08,602
[SPEAKER_10]: a daily sub and a per diem sub.

884
01:22:09,262 --> 01:22:13,924
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm just curious, even at my own work where I work at MTRS, it comes up a lot.

885
01:22:14,365 --> 01:22:19,447
[SPEAKER_10]: And each school district has a different definition for what it is in their school district.

886
01:22:20,267 --> 01:22:24,829
[SPEAKER_10]: Some require DESE certification for long-term subs, some don't.

887
01:22:25,690 --> 01:22:28,151
[SPEAKER_10]: The same for per diem and daily subs.

888
01:22:28,211 --> 01:22:32,253
[SPEAKER_10]: So I was just wondering what Medford's definition was.

889
01:22:32,453 --> 01:22:32,673
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

890
01:22:33,218 --> 01:22:35,800
[SPEAKER_22]: We do have per diem and daily subs.

891
01:22:35,860 --> 01:22:37,221
[SPEAKER_22]: That term is synonymous.

892
01:22:37,321 --> 01:22:52,392
[SPEAKER_22]: So that means that the substitute calls into the sub pool that is open each day as staff members need to call out sick and or be absent for any reason.

893
01:22:52,472 --> 01:22:57,216
[SPEAKER_22]: So our sub pool is active and they are just daily subs.

894
01:22:57,316 --> 01:23:01,379
[SPEAKER_22]: They are not necessarily licensed in that capacity, but they are

895
01:23:01,809 --> 01:23:04,610
[SPEAKER_22]: covering for classes for absences.

896
01:23:05,131 --> 01:23:23,360
[SPEAKER_22]: The long-term subcategory is for a situation where we have an extended leave, that we know somebody may be out due to illness or due to maternity leave, and dependent on the candidate, if they are licensed or not, they would have a different pay rate.

897
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:29,583
[SPEAKER_22]: So it's dependent on their licensure and the timeline of their coverage.

898
01:23:31,793 --> 01:23:41,418
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I just had one question, because some of the locations were listed as male, like for example, like M-A-I-L for the location.

899
01:23:41,578 --> 01:23:43,459
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was just wondering, what does that mean?

900
01:23:43,499 --> 01:23:47,521
[SPEAKER_10]: It was really just miscellaneous throughout the spreadsheet.

901
01:23:47,621 --> 01:23:50,082
[SPEAKER_22]: So this is a report from payroll.

902
01:23:50,522 --> 01:24:00,147
[SPEAKER_22]: So the location just indicates the method on which any checks would be distributed if they received a live check.

903
01:24:00,632 --> 01:24:06,955
[SPEAKER_22]: It would either be mailed, it would be dispersed to each of the building locations based on where that employee was located.

904
01:24:07,736 --> 01:24:14,899
[SPEAKER_22]: And there are some employees that are considered district-wide, so they do move from building to building.

905
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:16,160
[SPEAKER_22]: OK, thank you.

906
01:24:17,121 --> 01:24:17,741
[SPEAKER_34]: Member Ruseau.

907
01:24:20,462 --> 01:24:22,743
[SPEAKER_34]: I have three questions, since one of them has already been covered.

908
01:24:22,904 --> 01:24:24,885
[SPEAKER_34]: How many hours did it take to create this report?

909
01:24:26,105 --> 01:24:27,786
[SPEAKER_34]: I mean, a ballpark?

910
01:24:30,154 --> 01:24:34,657
[SPEAKER_22]: between fine-tuning the report and staff a couple hours.

911
01:24:35,077 --> 01:24:35,477
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

912
01:24:37,118 --> 01:24:42,702
[SPEAKER_34]: On page two, one of the positions is just listed as the title being school.

913
01:24:44,063 --> 01:24:46,304
[SPEAKER_34]: About seven or eight up from the bottom.

914
01:24:55,871 --> 01:24:59,373
[SPEAKER_22]: So they would be non-unit members and

915
01:25:00,976 --> 01:25:14,091
[SPEAKER_22]: Again, that's a category that's in the payroll system, and it would likely be referring to a daily sub and just got a school identifier rather than a sub.

916
01:25:14,591 --> 01:25:15,032
[SPEAKER_34]: Oh, I see.

917
01:25:15,092 --> 01:25:15,352
[SPEAKER_34]: OK.

918
01:25:15,372 --> 01:25:16,734
[SPEAKER_34]: That makes sense, because they could be anywhere.

919
01:25:16,894 --> 01:25:17,234
[SPEAKER_34]: Correct.

920
01:25:17,354 --> 01:25:21,339
[SPEAKER_34]: And then on the very last page of the new hires,

921
01:25:23,686 --> 01:25:26,548
[SPEAKER_34]: The first column says non-unit ISS.

922
01:25:26,628 --> 01:25:27,488
[SPEAKER_34]: What's the ISS?

923
01:25:27,769 --> 01:25:30,370
[SPEAKER_22]: So the ISS is Instructional Support Staff.

924
01:25:30,410 --> 01:25:30,671
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

925
01:25:30,691 --> 01:25:33,712
[SPEAKER_22]: So it's basically a building-based substitute.

926
01:25:34,173 --> 01:25:37,435
[SPEAKER_22]: So that person is considered a full year.

927
01:25:38,496 --> 01:25:48,902
[SPEAKER_22]: They are assigned to that building, and they are able to be dispersed from the principal based on the need in the building if there's not enough coverage.

928
01:25:49,543 --> 01:25:49,823
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

929
01:25:53,095 --> 01:25:53,635
[SPEAKER_22]: Member Graham.

930
01:25:56,897 --> 01:26:07,622
[SPEAKER_19]: I noticed that in the report there were a number of retirements and about 60% of those retirements were not happening in the summer, but they were happening after the start of the school year.

931
01:26:07,662 --> 01:26:10,243
[SPEAKER_19]: And I was just wondering, is that normal?

932
01:26:11,544 --> 01:26:13,585
[SPEAKER_19]: Is 60% typical?

933
01:26:13,905 --> 01:26:16,507
[SPEAKER_19]: Or is this sort of an anomaly of the year?

934
01:26:17,387 --> 01:26:19,188
[SPEAKER_22]: So again, the header is

935
01:26:19,978 --> 01:26:22,119
[SPEAKER_22]: resignations slash retirements.

936
01:26:22,299 --> 01:26:31,381
[SPEAKER_22]: So not all of those are retirements, but we do have retirements that happen outside of just the July and August months.

937
01:26:31,561 --> 01:26:39,623
[SPEAKER_22]: It's dependent on their date of birth in some cases where they're not eligible until certain times of the year.

938
01:26:40,024 --> 01:26:42,744
[SPEAKER_22]: So that is, that's a normal occurrence.

939
01:26:43,685 --> 01:26:48,526
[SPEAKER_22]: But again, all of these are not considered retirements.

940
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:58,856
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's normal that 60% of our resignations slash retirements would happen during the school, the operating school year, or is that unusual in some way?

941
01:27:00,129 --> 01:27:08,753
[SPEAKER_22]: It's definitely, it shows you the significance of turnover in certain categories of the workforce and that's a norm.

942
01:27:09,094 --> 01:27:10,614
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, that's helpful.

943
01:27:12,695 --> 01:27:21,640
[SPEAKER_19]: And then I was also reading that we have like 60, I think it's like 61 people on leave of absence, is that correct?

944
01:27:22,913 --> 01:27:27,114
[SPEAKER_22]: No, again, that was total of different types of activity.

945
01:27:27,274 --> 01:27:31,616
[SPEAKER_22]: So we had 11 that are on a full year leave of absence.

946
01:27:32,116 --> 01:27:37,798
[SPEAKER_22]: We had 18 that were on leaves of absence, but we are expecting them to return at some point during the year.

947
01:27:38,638 --> 01:27:43,180
[SPEAKER_22]: 25 have been on a leave of absence and have since returned.

948
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:46,021
[SPEAKER_22]: And the others were workers comp cases.

949
01:27:46,581 --> 01:27:47,061
[SPEAKER_19]: And is that

950
01:27:47,566 --> 01:27:52,128
[SPEAKER_19]: Again, is that like a typical year, or is this unusual in some way?

951
01:27:52,168 --> 01:27:53,249
[SPEAKER_22]: This has been a bubble year.

952
01:27:53,749 --> 01:27:53,969
[SPEAKER_19]: OK.

953
01:27:54,289 --> 01:27:54,469
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes.

954
01:27:56,530 --> 01:27:56,810
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

955
01:27:57,130 --> 01:27:57,851
[SPEAKER_27]: Member McLaughlin.

956
01:27:58,551 --> 01:27:58,911
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

957
01:27:59,011 --> 01:28:02,613
[SPEAKER_24]: Thanks for the report, Assistant Superintendent Patterson.

958
01:28:03,393 --> 01:28:07,695
[SPEAKER_24]: I have a few questions on the resignation and retirements.

959
01:28:09,796 --> 01:28:11,757
[SPEAKER_24]: It looks like since July, we've had

960
01:28:12,903 --> 01:28:16,805
[SPEAKER_24]: eight paras retire or resign?

961
01:28:16,845 --> 01:28:19,106
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm wondering which those are.

962
01:28:19,146 --> 01:28:20,807
[SPEAKER_24]: Are they resign or retire, or do you know?

963
01:28:21,568 --> 01:28:23,509
[SPEAKER_22]: The majority are resignations.

964
01:28:23,949 --> 01:28:24,589
[SPEAKER_24]: Resignations.

965
01:28:25,410 --> 01:28:28,631
[SPEAKER_24]: And do you know, are we filling those positions, or what the status is?

966
01:28:28,651 --> 01:28:31,713
[SPEAKER_22]: We've been actively trying to fill all positions.

967
01:28:32,413 --> 01:28:32,613
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

968
01:28:33,253 --> 01:28:35,355
[SPEAKER_24]: So are we down eight paras right now?

969
01:28:35,675 --> 01:28:36,015
[SPEAKER_24]: Do you know?

970
01:28:36,075 --> 01:28:37,476
[SPEAKER_22]: We're not down eight paras, no.

971
01:28:37,936 --> 01:28:38,096
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

972
01:28:38,756 --> 01:28:39,617
[SPEAKER_24]: How many are we down?

973
01:28:39,817 --> 01:28:41,518
[SPEAKER_22]: I believe we're down two.

974
01:28:42,680 --> 01:28:45,441
[SPEAKER_22]: I think we've got some pending hires taking place.

975
01:28:45,781 --> 01:28:51,263
[SPEAKER_24]: OK, so you've hired six of the eight that have, you've replaced six of the eight that have, OK.

976
01:28:51,803 --> 01:29:04,048
[SPEAKER_24]: And so then for substitutes, for the daily substitutes, and the per diem substitutes, and the long term substitutes, I was given information, and I'm wondering if this is helpful or accurate.

977
01:29:04,088 --> 01:29:09,690
[SPEAKER_24]: If there's a para that calls in sick to the special education classrooms,

978
01:29:10,199 --> 01:29:13,241
[SPEAKER_24]: the system comes up as no substitute required.

979
01:29:13,541 --> 01:29:14,261
[SPEAKER_24]: Is that accurate?

980
01:29:14,461 --> 01:29:18,123
[SPEAKER_22]: It's dependent on where the para is assigned.

981
01:29:18,703 --> 01:29:22,345
[SPEAKER_22]: So a Gen Ed para is not necessarily filled.

982
01:29:22,925 --> 01:29:28,188
[SPEAKER_22]: We try to go with the high needs groups that we do open a slot for filling.

983
01:29:28,608 --> 01:29:37,373
[SPEAKER_22]: But it's noteworthy to indicate that even without the paras or just the general, the teaching, that it's difficult to fill.

984
01:29:37,853 --> 01:29:39,934
[SPEAKER_22]: And sometimes the nature of when

985
01:29:40,458 --> 01:29:46,862
[SPEAKER_22]: they are providing a sick day or a day that they'll be out, it's too late for the sub-pool to activate.

986
01:29:47,603 --> 01:30:01,572
[SPEAKER_22]: So there's a number of things that are indicative of whether or not a classroom environment is going to be fully covered, and that's where we have the ISSs in the building to provide that additional support.

987
01:30:02,352 --> 01:30:09,977
[SPEAKER_24]: So how does that work if there's an IEP that's requiring paras in the classroom, if the para's not being replaced if they're out sick?

988
01:30:10,982 --> 01:30:16,605
[SPEAKER_22]: That's a totally different scope outside of just this personnel report.

989
01:30:17,045 --> 01:30:21,247
[SPEAKER_22]: I can't speak to that in terms of the IEP requirements.

990
01:30:23,728 --> 01:30:28,371
[SPEAKER_24]: But in terms of replacing substitutes in the classroom, so regarding the personnel report.

991
01:30:28,451 --> 01:30:40,577
[SPEAKER_24]: So if a para's out, and they're saying no substitute required on the personnel list when a para calls in sick, there's no substitute going into that classroom.

992
01:30:41,007 --> 01:30:43,228
[SPEAKER_24]: And I guess these are also high needs classrooms.

993
01:30:43,248 --> 01:30:44,948
[SPEAKER_24]: They're not gen ed.

994
01:30:46,248 --> 01:30:50,469
[SPEAKER_22]: If they are high needs, it is usually open to the sub pool.

995
01:30:50,989 --> 01:31:00,692
[SPEAKER_22]: Whether or not we get an active substitute for that, it's not determined if it's actually filled.

996
01:31:01,052 --> 01:31:03,632
[SPEAKER_22]: We don't dictate those slots.

997
01:31:04,072 --> 01:31:10,554
[SPEAKER_22]: So the pool is open to anybody that's assigned as a daily sub, and they actually select which

998
01:31:11,294 --> 01:31:13,536
[SPEAKER_22]: placements that they will go on a given day.

999
01:31:14,016 --> 01:31:20,741
[SPEAKER_22]: So even if a para position opened up that a substitute was required, there's no guarantee that it would get filled.

1000
01:31:21,001 --> 01:31:21,782
[SPEAKER_22]: Sure, I understand that.

1001
01:31:21,802 --> 01:31:27,806
[SPEAKER_22]: It's not guaranteed that an elementary teacher at one of the other schools would be filled either.

1002
01:31:28,087 --> 01:31:29,087
[SPEAKER_24]: Sure, I understand that.

1003
01:31:29,247 --> 01:31:39,155
[SPEAKER_24]: But is the system, is the software system coming up saying no substitute required, which obviously if that's what it's saying then there's definitely not going to be a substitute, never mind whether there are any

1004
01:31:39,730 --> 01:31:41,251
[SPEAKER_24]: available or not, that's what I'm asking.

1005
01:31:41,271 --> 01:31:44,453
[SPEAKER_22]: No, the majority are open for substitutes.

1006
01:31:45,293 --> 01:31:46,614
[SPEAKER_24]: Are open no substitutes?

1007
01:31:46,754 --> 01:31:48,055
[SPEAKER_22]: Are open for substitutes.

1008
01:31:48,115 --> 01:31:48,895
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, open for substitutes.

1009
01:31:48,935 --> 01:31:51,336
[SPEAKER_24]: In what instance would it say no substitute required?

1010
01:31:52,257 --> 01:31:57,220
[SPEAKER_22]: If it was identified as a gen ed and not required for the para coverage.

1011
01:31:57,540 --> 01:32:04,884
[SPEAKER_22]: So the initial intent of the system was to provide coverage for the teachers in the classroom.

1012
01:32:05,444 --> 01:32:06,845
[SPEAKER_22]: So that had been the

1013
01:32:07,912 --> 01:32:10,693
[SPEAKER_22]: the focus to provide coverage as the teacher.

1014
01:32:11,134 --> 01:32:23,080
[SPEAKER_22]: So in terms of the paras, those with the exception of the high needs classrooms that they always need coverage, it had been closed off that a para might not necessarily have coverage.

1015
01:32:24,220 --> 01:32:24,461
[SPEAKER_24]: OK.

1016
01:32:25,061 --> 01:32:34,726
[SPEAKER_24]: So I guess I'm wondering, is it a personnel question or a special ed question that I should be directing this if there are high needs classrooms where a para is calling in sick and the personnel

1017
01:32:35,726 --> 01:32:42,028
[SPEAKER_24]: memo that comes up on the, whatever your software system is on the website, that says no substitute required.

1018
01:32:42,208 --> 01:32:43,628
[SPEAKER_24]: How is that addressed?

1019
01:32:44,108 --> 01:32:44,928
[SPEAKER_24]: Would that be personnel?

1020
01:32:44,948 --> 01:32:45,949
[SPEAKER_24]: Would that be special education?

1021
01:32:45,969 --> 01:32:46,129
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1022
01:32:46,249 --> 01:32:53,851
[SPEAKER_22]: We would certainly, if there was somebody that was erroneously categorized as not requiring a sub, we would certainly change that.

1023
01:32:54,331 --> 01:32:54,551
[SPEAKER_24]: OK.

1024
01:32:54,871 --> 01:32:55,611
[SPEAKER_24]: And so who's we?

1025
01:32:55,651 --> 01:32:57,412
[SPEAKER_24]: We let you know if we see that?

1026
01:32:57,852 --> 01:32:58,052
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1027
01:32:58,272 --> 01:33:00,372
[SPEAKER_22]: Working with the special ed director.

1028
01:33:00,492 --> 01:33:00,752
[SPEAKER_24]: OK.

1029
01:33:00,833 --> 01:33:01,893
[SPEAKER_24]: So if powers are getting

1030
01:33:03,092 --> 01:33:17,003
[SPEAKER_24]: If information is coming up when a para calls in sick and the system says no substitute required and we know it's a substantially separate or high needs classroom, they should be letting folks know that that's a glitch in the system and that shouldn't be happening.

1031
01:33:17,104 --> 01:33:17,984
[SPEAKER_24]: Is that what I'm hearing you say?

1032
01:33:18,024 --> 01:33:18,785
[SPEAKER_22]: It's not a glitch.

1033
01:33:19,085 --> 01:33:29,474
[SPEAKER_22]: They would just need to notify the special ed director and we can certainly meet on that to revisit those paras that have been assigned to the high needs groups.

1034
01:33:29,714 --> 01:33:30,374
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, great.

1035
01:33:30,535 --> 01:33:30,815
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1036
01:33:33,766 --> 01:33:39,791
[SPEAKER_27]: Maybe in your behavior health, special ed, and public service subcommittee can go over that.

1037
01:33:40,031 --> 01:33:40,251
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes.

1038
01:33:40,612 --> 01:33:40,952
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

1039
01:33:42,333 --> 01:33:42,633
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

1040
01:33:43,154 --> 01:33:52,502
[SPEAKER_27]: Motion to receive and place on file offered by motion by member Kreatz, seconded by member Vandekloot.

1041
01:33:52,582 --> 01:33:53,322
[SPEAKER_27]: All those in favor?

1042
01:33:53,343 --> 01:33:53,963
[SPEAKER_27]: Aye.

1043
01:33:53,983 --> 01:33:54,644
[SPEAKER_27]: Paper passes.

1044
01:33:55,945 --> 01:33:59,548
[SPEAKER_27]: Number seven, report on 2020 middle school lottery.

1045
01:33:59,588 --> 01:34:00,849
[SPEAKER_27]: Dr. Bernadette Brickadeli.

1046
01:34:09,633 --> 01:34:10,113
[SPEAKER_16]: Good evening.

1047
01:34:11,874 --> 01:34:29,679
[SPEAKER_16]: Just about a year ago, on February 11, 2019, the Medford School Committee voted unanimously, it was a 7-0 vote, to implement a random lottery system with the goal of balancing the racial and socioeconomic differences between the Andrews Middle School and the McGlynn Middle School.

1048
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:38,882
[SPEAKER_16]: Current middle school socioeconomic data indicate a more balanced grade 6 student population as compared to grade 7 and 8.

1049
01:34:40,222 --> 01:34:48,104
[SPEAKER_16]: suggesting that last year's lottery has helped the district move toward the goal of a better balanced student population.

1050
01:34:49,384 --> 01:34:53,905
[SPEAKER_16]: I did attach those numbers to this report, so hopefully you've had a chance to take a look at that.

1051
01:34:55,025 --> 01:35:09,348
[SPEAKER_16]: This year, in 2020, the district will continue with those efforts toward creating a more equitable school community and embracing Medford's diversity while continuing to build upon its strengths and to encourage all families to believe in one Medford.

1052
01:35:10,438 --> 01:35:25,951
[SPEAKER_16]: For this year's lottery and consistent with the 2019 protocol, an equitable number of students from each elementary school will be assigned to each of the two middle schools while controlling for sibling preference and programmatic needs.

1053
01:35:27,032 --> 01:35:34,198
[SPEAKER_16]: The district will also follow a similar protocol for sibling preference as it did last year in 2019.

1054
01:35:36,004 --> 01:35:54,195
[SPEAKER_16]: The district has already begun pre-identifying those sibling students, and this year, which is a change from last year, based on suggestions from members of this committee, both an opt-in and an opt-out option will be on the form that will be distributed to applicable students on February 26, 2020.

1055
01:35:56,136 --> 01:36:04,681
[SPEAKER_16]: So again, this year, those identified with the option for a sibling preference will be asked to either opt-in or opt-out.

1056
01:36:06,667 --> 01:36:13,971
[SPEAKER_16]: The district has contracted Douglas M. Thorpe, CPA, from the firm of Johnson O'Connor and Wakefield to conduct the lottery drawing.

1057
01:36:14,691 --> 01:36:21,695
[SPEAKER_16]: Parents and guardians are invited to attend the drawing, and it is scheduled for Thursday, March 26, 2020, from 3 p.m.

1058
01:36:21,735 --> 01:36:22,475
[SPEAKER_16]: to 4 p.m.

1059
01:36:23,056 --> 01:36:24,676
[SPEAKER_16]: in the library at Medford High School.

1060
01:36:25,377 --> 01:36:28,418
[SPEAKER_16]: This is roughly one month earlier than occurred last year.

1061
01:36:29,519 --> 01:36:35,062
[SPEAKER_16]: Results will be posted on our website and on our blog, and will be available to view within hours of the drawing.

1062
01:36:36,112 --> 01:36:41,616
[SPEAKER_16]: Letters confirming each student's middle school assignment will go out to all grade five students by April 1st, 2020.

1063
01:36:44,518 --> 01:36:56,707
[SPEAKER_16]: Following the lottery, grade five students and their parents are invited to attend their assigned middle school orientation program at the McGlynn Middle School on May 6th and at the Andrews Middle School on May 7th.

1064
01:36:58,373 --> 01:37:08,359
[SPEAKER_16]: During these orientation programs, students will tour the building, learn about programs and activities, and meet their principal, assistant principal, teachers, and other school staff.

1065
01:37:09,602 --> 01:37:11,944
[SPEAKER_16]: I've also included a timeline of events.

1066
01:37:12,725 --> 01:37:21,932
[SPEAKER_16]: Superintendent Edward Vinson mentioned the superintendent information sessions that will occur between Tuesday, March 3rd and Tuesday, March 10th.

1067
01:37:23,233 --> 01:37:27,676
[SPEAKER_16]: Those events will occur, as she indicated, between those dates.

1068
01:37:28,096 --> 01:37:32,340
[SPEAKER_16]: These dates will be posted on our website and will be available for parents to see.

1069
01:37:33,240 --> 01:37:39,185
[SPEAKER_16]: Other lottery dates include the February 26th sibling opt-in, opt-out form.

1070
01:37:41,004 --> 01:37:45,006
[SPEAKER_16]: Those forms will be due the following week on Tuesday, March 4th.

1071
01:37:45,986 --> 01:37:54,569
[SPEAKER_16]: On Wednesday, March 18th, each fifth grade student will receive a lottery number in a letter addressed to the parent guardian and sent home with the student.

1072
01:37:54,890 --> 01:37:56,930
[SPEAKER_16]: So again, we do not announce student names.

1073
01:37:57,411 --> 01:37:58,951
[SPEAKER_16]: Students are identified by number.

1074
01:38:00,152 --> 01:38:01,492
[SPEAKER_16]: Each school will have a series.

1075
01:38:02,092 --> 01:38:05,694
[SPEAKER_16]: I think last year we did the Brooks School with the 200 series.

1076
01:38:07,657 --> 01:38:15,899
[SPEAKER_16]: the McGlynn School with the 300 series, and so on, so that numbers are specifically identified for specific elementary schools.

1077
01:38:18,360 --> 01:38:21,981
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, the drawing will occur on Thursday, March 26th, from 3 p.m.

1078
01:38:22,001 --> 01:38:22,681
[SPEAKER_16]: to 4 p.m.

1079
01:38:22,781 --> 01:38:29,743
[SPEAKER_16]: in the high school, and on Wednesday, April 1st, those assignments will go out to the students.

1080
01:38:30,163 --> 01:38:36,565
[SPEAKER_16]: And again, May 6th and May 7th at the McGlynn and the Andrew schools, respectively, the open house.

1081
01:38:38,120 --> 01:38:40,162
[SPEAKER_16]: So again, we've attached the data sheets.

1082
01:38:40,222 --> 01:38:44,346
[SPEAKER_16]: The data sheets do indicate that some change has occurred.

1083
01:38:44,406 --> 01:38:59,720
[SPEAKER_16]: If you look at the grade six results versus the grade seven and eight data information on the students, you will see that there is a difference in the demographic data, the free lunch, reduced lunch, and other categories.

1084
01:39:00,581 --> 01:39:03,223
[SPEAKER_16]: At this point, I would be happy to take any questions that you may have.

1085
01:39:03,644 --> 01:39:03,944
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1086
01:39:04,833 --> 01:39:05,514
[SPEAKER_18]: Member van de Kloot.

1087
01:39:06,734 --> 01:39:09,376
[SPEAKER_18]: Just one thing in the timeline that doesn't make sense to me.

1088
01:39:10,157 --> 01:39:16,641
[SPEAKER_18]: I note that the sibling opt-in, opt-out form is due on March 4th.

1089
01:39:17,322 --> 01:39:23,726
[SPEAKER_18]: But the open houses, the three of them occur after that deadline.

1090
01:39:24,247 --> 01:39:33,834
[SPEAKER_18]: So for me, it would make more sense for the sibling opt-in, opt-out form to be sent home, to be due on March 11th.

1091
01:39:41,112 --> 01:39:43,693
[SPEAKER_16]: You're not incorrect.

1092
01:39:43,713 --> 01:39:50,734
[SPEAKER_16]: The dates were chosen because they coincide with, I believe, PTO meetings, as I have been told.

1093
01:39:51,354 --> 01:39:56,935
[SPEAKER_16]: So based on the work that we did last year, we needed three weeks to back up into the sibling.

1094
01:39:57,436 --> 01:39:59,136
[SPEAKER_16]: We can fast forward that.

1095
01:39:59,156 --> 01:40:04,477
[SPEAKER_16]: I will tell you with our team, it is a lot of work to do that.

1096
01:40:05,257 --> 01:40:12,521
[SPEAKER_16]: We were hoping to get this information out via the principles about the sibling opt-in, sibling opt-out.

1097
01:40:13,261 --> 01:40:22,966
[SPEAKER_16]: So this year, where it is not simply a sibling opt-out, we felt like the form would be very specific.

1098
01:40:23,086 --> 01:40:24,287
[SPEAKER_16]: We want an answer.

1099
01:40:24,347 --> 01:40:29,870
[SPEAKER_16]: If we don't get an answer from the family on whether they want to opt-in or opt-out, we're going to follow up with that family.

1100
01:40:30,737 --> 01:40:31,758
[SPEAKER_16]: more work on that end.

1101
01:40:32,478 --> 01:40:39,944
[SPEAKER_16]: But I do understand that the dates for the information sessions were selected because they coincide with PTO meetings.

1102
01:40:40,704 --> 01:40:47,149
[SPEAKER_18]: But, you know, with... If it would work such that the sibling opt-in, opt-out form

1103
01:40:47,749 --> 01:40:54,631
[SPEAKER_18]: is not a drop-dead, but which is to say that instead they'd be collected with the ideal on March 4th.

1104
01:40:54,731 --> 01:41:00,433
[SPEAKER_18]: But if there were forms that were not turned in, there would be follow-up with the parent.

1105
01:41:00,473 --> 01:41:01,673
[SPEAKER_18]: I would be comfortable with that.

1106
01:41:04,274 --> 01:41:05,854
[SPEAKER_18]: But that's a procedural thing.

1107
01:41:06,014 --> 01:41:11,956
[SPEAKER_18]: If it's meant that if the parent doesn't return the form by that date,

1108
01:41:12,859 --> 01:41:17,784
[SPEAKER_18]: then I'm not particular, you know, one way or the other, then I'm not particularly comfortable with it.

1109
01:41:17,825 --> 01:41:20,548
[SPEAKER_18]: But I assume you'd be following up with it?

1110
01:41:20,848 --> 01:41:28,236
[SPEAKER_16]: So we've discussed this and we are going to follow up with each parent to make sure that there is no question as to do they want in or out.

1111
01:41:29,133 --> 01:41:29,393
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1112
01:41:30,214 --> 01:41:34,799
[SPEAKER_18]: If you can make that, that makes them more comfortable with it.

1113
01:41:35,400 --> 01:41:35,760
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1114
01:41:36,361 --> 01:41:36,901
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Kreatz.

1115
01:41:37,482 --> 01:41:37,582
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi.

1116
01:41:37,902 --> 01:41:39,063
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Dr. Vicazelli.

1117
01:41:39,083 --> 01:41:39,624
[SPEAKER_10]: You're welcome.

1118
01:41:39,824 --> 01:41:50,375
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to say, you know, I noticed last year the feedback we got was we didn't communicate, you know, timely, early, and I'm happy to see that we're getting this information out, all the dates out.

1119
01:41:50,825 --> 01:41:51,445
[SPEAKER_10]: so early.

1120
01:41:51,605 --> 01:41:53,146
[SPEAKER_10]: It's only beginning.

1121
01:41:53,306 --> 01:41:53,926
[SPEAKER_10]: It's February.

1122
01:41:54,686 --> 01:41:57,447
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just wanted to check.

1123
01:41:57,647 --> 01:41:59,088
[SPEAKER_10]: I have just a couple of questions.

1124
01:41:59,188 --> 01:42:00,108
[SPEAKER_10]: Two are really simple.

1125
01:42:00,669 --> 01:42:03,430
[SPEAKER_10]: Are the open houses going to have the student-led tours?

1126
01:42:03,810 --> 01:42:10,332
[SPEAKER_10]: I know they had them last year where the students also participated in the tours along with the teachers and staff.

1127
01:42:11,472 --> 01:42:18,255
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was something that I think a lot of the students really appreciated seeing and meeting other students that are in the middle schools.

1128
01:42:19,321 --> 01:42:24,066
[SPEAKER_16]: So I have not discussed the details yet with the principals.

1129
01:42:24,226 --> 01:42:27,989
[SPEAKER_16]: My understanding is that those open houses are going to be similar.

1130
01:42:28,010 --> 01:42:30,172
[SPEAKER_16]: I know the curriculum directors were there.

1131
01:42:30,192 --> 01:42:31,593
[SPEAKER_16]: I attended.

1132
01:42:31,613 --> 01:42:35,757
[SPEAKER_16]: I thought they were quite smooth and people liked it.

1133
01:42:35,857 --> 01:42:38,360
[SPEAKER_16]: So certainly we want to repeat what was good.

1134
01:42:38,380 --> 01:42:41,483
[SPEAKER_16]: And if there's anything that can be improved upon, certainly we want to do that.

1135
01:42:42,403 --> 01:42:43,604
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening, everybody.

1136
01:42:43,644 --> 01:42:45,664
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm happy to take that question right there.

1137
01:42:46,245 --> 01:42:51,067
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the hallmarks of our open house last year were those student ambassador-led tours.

1138
01:42:51,467 --> 01:42:57,609
[SPEAKER_09]: And we are very interested in not only having them once again, but also adding on to them and incorporating the students as much as we can.

1139
01:42:57,949 --> 01:43:00,670
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that was one of the best pieces of feedback that we received.

1140
01:43:00,850 --> 01:43:09,234
[SPEAKER_09]: The students leading the effort and showing the way and exercising those great leadership opportunities to brag about their school and how much they're really proud to be a part of.

1141
01:43:10,234 --> 01:43:11,235
[SPEAKER_10]: Great, thank you.

1142
01:43:12,496 --> 01:43:14,218
[SPEAKER_10]: And then these are kind of fun questions.

1143
01:43:14,979 --> 01:43:22,306
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just wanted to know, last year we had the middle school barbecue in the summer and it was a great, I thought it was a great success.

1144
01:43:22,886 --> 01:43:26,730
[SPEAKER_10]: I went, I helped serve, and Peter, he did a lot of burgers.

1145
01:43:28,311 --> 01:43:30,854
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just wanted to know if that was maybe in the plans.

1146
01:43:30,914 --> 01:43:34,117
[SPEAKER_10]: I know it's early, but if we were planning to do something like that again this summer.

1147
01:43:36,341 --> 01:43:55,682
[SPEAKER_03]: So actually, following February vacation, I'm planning to work with 6th and 7th graders to form a committee between the two middle schools to not only see how we can do the barbecue, but what are the things we might be able to add to maybe make that more of an overall fun day and an approach to the introduction to the new middle schools.

1148
01:43:56,172 --> 01:43:56,832
[SPEAKER_10]: Great, great.

1149
01:43:57,413 --> 01:44:01,294
[SPEAKER_10]: And keep us up to date, because I know a lot of us want to help out and volunteer.

1150
01:44:01,554 --> 01:44:01,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

1151
01:44:01,915 --> 01:44:06,797
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll be probably looking for donations and other support to make it really awesome.

1152
01:44:06,837 --> 01:44:07,177
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1153
01:44:15,097 --> 01:44:15,817
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you all set, Kathy?

1154
01:44:16,118 --> 01:44:17,418
[SPEAKER_10]: I just had one other question.

1155
01:44:17,498 --> 01:44:31,427
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just wanted to know if the auditing company was going to be doing anything differently to ensure the equitable number of students from each elementary school assigned to the two middle schools?

1156
01:44:33,708 --> 01:44:38,191
[SPEAKER_10]: I've heard that one school didn't have a lot of students in that middle school.

1157
01:44:38,271 --> 01:44:40,712
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was still a little bit fuzzy last year.

1158
01:44:42,313 --> 01:44:53,780
[SPEAKER_10]: So I was just wondering if there was any plan to do anything a little bit differently to balance it out a little bit better or... So the plan is to do the process similar to what we did last year.

1159
01:44:54,201 --> 01:44:54,901
[SPEAKER_16]: So it is...

1160
01:44:57,290 --> 01:44:57,530
[SPEAKER_16]: True.

1161
01:44:57,610 --> 01:45:04,677
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you'll notice, I put in there that there's an equitable distribution within the lottery.

1162
01:45:05,278 --> 01:45:08,361
[SPEAKER_16]: But we need to control for students who need specific programs.

1163
01:45:08,401 --> 01:45:14,686
[SPEAKER_16]: If a specific program is housed at one of the two middle schools, we need to take that into consideration.

1164
01:45:17,492 --> 01:45:18,533
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's big.

1165
01:45:18,553 --> 01:45:20,894
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what takes the most amount of time.

1166
01:45:21,635 --> 01:45:26,197
[SPEAKER_16]: So the director of student services has been working on the list.

1167
01:45:26,237 --> 01:45:31,000
[SPEAKER_16]: We really revet these lists to make sure that we're doing it the right way.

1168
01:45:31,260 --> 01:45:42,966
[SPEAKER_16]: That's less a function of the CPA than it is a function of us knowing our students going through and making sure that they're going to the school that's most appropriate for their needs.

1169
01:45:43,747 --> 01:45:46,128
[SPEAKER_16]: So I understand that there were

1170
01:45:47,046 --> 01:45:48,507
[SPEAKER_16]: There were questions last year.

1171
01:45:50,728 --> 01:45:56,571
[SPEAKER_16]: In the interest of transparency, our numbers are there and we're comfortable sharing them with anybody.

1172
01:45:57,231 --> 01:46:00,393
[SPEAKER_16]: We also have a reason for what we're doing.

1173
01:46:01,814 --> 01:46:07,917
[SPEAKER_16]: The CPA's role, they met with us and they went over the process with us.

1174
01:46:09,738 --> 01:46:15,702
[SPEAKER_16]: probably three weeks before the lottery last year, but their primary function was to be there on that day.

1175
01:46:15,722 --> 01:46:36,634
[SPEAKER_16]: I was there behind the scenes, as was our data manager, so we were there running around, making sure that if there were questions, the CPA, they did a pretty smooth job, but their job really is to pull those numbers from StatTracker, which is that computer-generated random number

1176
01:46:38,186 --> 01:46:39,750
[SPEAKER_16]: generated system for us.

1177
01:46:41,474 --> 01:46:41,755
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1178
01:46:41,795 --> 01:46:43,299
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Madam Superintendent.

1179
01:46:43,988 --> 01:47:00,156
[SPEAKER_32]: I just was going to echo what Dr. Riccadeli just shared, that in our individualized, the school presentations, we say that it is not an equal balance, but we do try to do it in an equitable way, a fair way.

1180
01:47:00,656 --> 01:47:10,881
[SPEAKER_32]: So again, English learners would be assigned to the McGlynn school, depending on what the specific programmatic areas are.

1181
01:47:11,221 --> 01:47:13,002
[SPEAKER_32]: So we don't have control over

1182
01:47:13,682 --> 01:47:25,287
[SPEAKER_32]: those numbers, it could be a fluctuation from one year to another year, but that was the most, I would say, equitable way to be able to try to balance the numbers.

1183
01:47:25,387 --> 01:47:33,150
[SPEAKER_32]: So that piece does need to remain intact so that students are assigned to the right programmatic area.

1184
01:47:34,050 --> 01:47:34,471
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

1185
01:47:34,691 --> 01:47:37,252
[SPEAKER_27]: School committee woman McLaughlin.

1186
01:47:39,353 --> 01:47:39,713
Thank you.

1187
01:47:39,753 --> 01:47:40,073
[SPEAKER_27]: You're welcome.

1188
01:47:46,743 --> 01:47:51,544
[SPEAKER_24]: A lot of hard work and work in progress, so thank you for the report.

1189
01:47:52,284 --> 01:48:01,367
[SPEAKER_24]: I do have some questions around the equitable piece of it, and I appreciate you acknowledging that we're doing the best we can with what we have in terms of the programmatic elements.

1190
01:48:01,407 --> 01:48:02,668
[SPEAKER_24]: You had said that

1191
01:48:03,755 --> 01:48:12,141
[SPEAKER_24]: We have to ensure that the children are going to the school that's most appropriate for their needs, which I think begs a bigger question in our district around equity.

1192
01:48:12,341 --> 01:48:16,504
[SPEAKER_24]: All of our schools should be able to deliver for each of our children's needs.

1193
01:48:16,904 --> 01:48:21,588
[SPEAKER_24]: And I know that that's a process that we're working towards and that I hope that the school committee continues to work towards.

1194
01:48:22,368 --> 01:48:23,749
[SPEAKER_24]: But I have questions in that realm.

1195
01:48:24,730 --> 01:48:25,971
[SPEAKER_24]: And we get a lot of these questions.

1196
01:48:26,011 --> 01:48:28,192
[SPEAKER_24]: So getting back to what was happening last year with the

1197
01:48:29,193 --> 01:48:30,574
[SPEAKER_24]: with the audit.

1198
01:48:31,194 --> 01:48:39,359
[SPEAKER_24]: Some of our schools have disproportionately more high-need students, whether they be English learners, students with disabilities, economically disadvantaged students.

1199
01:48:39,899 --> 01:48:54,548
[SPEAKER_24]: And so if you're coming from a pool of elementary school students that have a higher population of high-need students, and then they're rounding out the number, or everyone's getting the same amount of students that are in the lottery.

1200
01:48:55,449 --> 01:48:57,750
[SPEAKER_24]: One school has a disproportionate amount of

1201
01:48:58,969 --> 01:49:04,534
[SPEAKER_24]: English learners or students with disabilities, and then their numbers are skewed because they are going to a particular environment.

1202
01:49:04,574 --> 01:49:09,418
[SPEAKER_24]: And so how is that being adjusted for is one question that I have.

1203
01:49:09,478 --> 01:49:12,521
[SPEAKER_24]: Another is we talk about sibling preference.

1204
01:49:13,141 --> 01:49:17,886
[SPEAKER_24]: What happens if you have a sibling that is a student with a disability that's going to a programmatic piece?

1205
01:49:18,606 --> 01:49:21,889
[SPEAKER_24]: Or if you have a sibling who you've aged out of the

1206
01:49:23,476 --> 01:49:29,817
[SPEAKER_24]: specific English learner program that might be applied for that program or for that school and you're going to another.

1207
01:49:29,857 --> 01:49:35,959
[SPEAKER_24]: So how are we addressing sibling preference for our students with high needs or that have siblings with high needs.

1208
01:49:36,399 --> 01:49:41,280
[SPEAKER_24]: And then the third is what if students are identified after the fact.

1209
01:49:41,960 --> 01:49:53,142
[SPEAKER_24]: What if you know the lottery happens and they're enrolled into a school and then they're subsequently identified as having a particular disability or they enroll into our schools initially and they're in one school

1210
01:49:53,749 --> 01:49:55,350
[SPEAKER_24]: And then they're subsequently identified.

1211
01:49:55,390 --> 01:49:56,191
[SPEAKER_24]: How are we addressing that?

1212
01:49:56,211 --> 01:50:00,954
[SPEAKER_24]: Are we taking them out of a school mid-year to deal with programmatic elements?

1213
01:50:01,035 --> 01:50:03,216
[SPEAKER_24]: Or how is that being addressed?

1214
01:50:03,817 --> 01:50:04,077
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

1215
01:50:04,257 --> 01:50:05,378
[SPEAKER_16]: I should have written down.

1216
01:50:05,398 --> 01:50:07,299
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, no, I can go through them again.

1217
01:50:07,419 --> 01:50:08,000
[SPEAKER_16]: One, two, and three.

1218
01:50:08,040 --> 01:50:12,063
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, let me start with number three, where you said, what if a student is identified after the fact?

1219
01:50:12,083 --> 01:50:12,323
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure.

1220
01:50:12,743 --> 01:50:16,206
[SPEAKER_16]: OK, first and foremost, we need to look at student needs.

1221
01:50:16,866 --> 01:50:17,667
[SPEAKER_16]: And it has happened.

1222
01:50:18,522 --> 01:50:29,409
[SPEAKER_16]: So if there's a specific need for a student and a student needs a specific program at one of the two schools, that's what's going to drive where that student is going to go.

1223
01:50:30,690 --> 01:50:34,272
[SPEAKER_16]: We like to think we're going to catch that ahead of time, but things happen.

1224
01:50:35,232 --> 01:50:40,816
[SPEAKER_16]: So the intent is not to shift students from one school to the other.

1225
01:50:41,206 --> 01:50:48,608
[SPEAKER_16]: but situations come up, and if that comes up, we're open-minded enough to do what is in the best interest of the child.

1226
01:50:50,449 --> 01:50:52,709
[SPEAKER_16]: The second question, I believe, was about sibling preference.

1227
01:50:53,530 --> 01:51:00,231
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so there are a number of cases where a student can fall in a number of different categories.

1228
01:51:00,632 --> 01:51:09,234
[SPEAKER_16]: So it is possible, there's a student that is an EL student, a student that has a special education programmatic requirement,

1229
01:51:09,890 --> 01:51:11,652
[SPEAKER_16]: and perhaps they are a sibling.

1230
01:51:13,093 --> 01:51:18,218
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think that did happen last year where there was at least one student that fell into three different categories.

1231
01:51:18,919 --> 01:51:23,664
[SPEAKER_16]: So first we go to what's the programmatic need of the student.

1232
01:51:23,684 --> 01:51:25,225
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're looking at the need of the student.

1233
01:51:26,306 --> 01:51:32,232
[SPEAKER_16]: And in many cases, that is what's going to drive this.

1234
01:51:32,622 --> 01:51:37,764
[SPEAKER_16]: But there's a possibility that it's the sibling preference.

1235
01:51:39,044 --> 01:51:42,525
[SPEAKER_16]: We had a number of conversations with parents last year about this.

1236
01:51:42,545 --> 01:51:51,189
[SPEAKER_16]: I think there may have been one that opted the sibling preference over the programmatic recommendation.

1237
01:51:51,769 --> 01:51:57,351
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think the bottom line in this case is that we need to look at each case individually.

1238
01:51:58,071 --> 01:52:00,992
[SPEAKER_16]: And again, it's what the child needs.

1239
01:52:01,590 --> 01:52:04,252
[SPEAKER_16]: So I can't say it's going to happen this way.

1240
01:52:04,472 --> 01:52:05,793
[SPEAKER_16]: We'd need to look at the situation.

1241
01:52:06,874 --> 01:52:07,254
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1242
01:52:07,414 --> 01:52:09,395
[SPEAKER_16]: And then the first one, I'm sorry, if you can.

1243
01:52:09,415 --> 01:52:22,244
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, it was just how are we going to address the equity for students with high needs so that if we're being random and trying to be equitable across the schools, that we're not addressing all of the students in terms of the equity for the lottery because of the programmatic elements.

1244
01:52:22,284 --> 01:52:26,667
[SPEAKER_24]: But I think that's probably a much bigger question than you can address tonight, Dr. O'Keefe.

1245
01:52:26,687 --> 01:52:30,770
[SPEAKER_16]: We did not control for high needs unless that need was

1246
01:52:31,451 --> 01:52:36,713
[SPEAKER_16]: a programmatic need, if it was EL, if it was a certain special ed need.

1247
01:52:36,773 --> 01:52:40,213
[SPEAKER_16]: So we did not look at the socioeconomics.

1248
01:52:40,254 --> 01:52:55,318
[SPEAKER_16]: But what I think, when you look at those results, when you look at the difference of grade 6, the current grade 6 differentiation between two schools, and you look at grade 7 and 8, you see much less of a difference in grade 6.

1249
01:52:56,727 --> 01:53:02,310
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think that's a result that's probably a byproduct of this lottery.

1250
01:53:02,650 --> 01:53:06,553
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not perfect, but I think there's a better balance.

1251
01:53:07,593 --> 01:53:19,120
[SPEAKER_24]: So could we get comparable data, or perhaps this is a motion that I need to make for comparable data on those populations so we can see what that distribution is among our schools?

1252
01:53:20,701 --> 01:53:22,702
[SPEAKER_16]: Of the socioeconomic

1253
01:53:23,280 --> 01:53:31,622
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, the economic, yeah, sure, if we have the data, economically disadvantaged, but also our students with disabilities and our English learners, like what's the distribution across the schools?

1254
01:53:31,662 --> 01:53:39,704
[SPEAKER_24]: And so for the, if we know that the McGlynn is getting all of our English learners, then clearly they're going to have a higher need for English learners.

1255
01:53:39,744 --> 01:53:45,506
[SPEAKER_24]: So then equity is not that everybody gets the same, it's that everybody gets what they need, right?

1256
01:53:45,586 --> 01:53:50,947
[SPEAKER_24]: So if we know that the McGlynn's going to have a higher need, are they getting more resources to support their need?

1257
01:53:51,893 --> 01:53:53,135
[SPEAKER_24]: versus other schools.

1258
01:53:53,215 --> 01:53:55,437
[SPEAKER_24]: So I guess I'm looking for similar data.

1259
01:53:55,457 --> 01:54:10,191
[SPEAKER_24]: So I guess I'm making a motion that if we could, this is a great report, if we could have, make a motion to have the same sort of data breakout for our students with disabilities, our English learners, and our economically disadvantaged among the middle schools.

1260
01:54:10,832 --> 01:54:11,472
[SPEAKER_24]: If we could do that.

1261
01:54:11,813 --> 01:54:12,854
[SPEAKER_24]: I make a motion for that.

1262
01:54:14,375 --> 01:54:14,736
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1263
01:54:15,276 --> 01:54:15,556
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1264
01:54:21,571 --> 01:54:32,280
[SPEAKER_27]: Motion, I was just gonna say from the chair, economic status is in here a bit through free and reduced lunch, but we can ask for further data.

1265
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:33,020
[SPEAKER_27]: We can drill down.

1266
01:54:33,461 --> 01:54:34,521
[SPEAKER_27]: We can drill down a little bit, okay.

1267
01:54:35,682 --> 01:54:45,430
[SPEAKER_27]: Motion by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Mustone for comparable data based on the ELL disabilities and economic status.

1268
01:54:46,791 --> 01:54:47,352
[SPEAKER_27]: All those in favor?

1269
01:54:47,372 --> 01:54:48,272
[SPEAKER_27]: Aye.

1270
01:54:48,292 --> 01:54:48,873
[SPEAKER_27]: All those opposed?

1271
01:54:49,551 --> 01:54:50,472
[SPEAKER_27]: That motion passes.

1272
01:54:50,792 --> 01:54:51,152
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

1273
01:54:51,353 --> 01:54:51,873
[SPEAKER_27]: Member Graham.

1274
01:54:53,615 --> 01:55:02,242
[SPEAKER_19]: Is there a district driven communication plan to families prior to the info sessions?

1275
01:55:04,324 --> 01:55:05,665
[SPEAKER_16]: So we are going to communicate.

1276
01:55:05,685 --> 01:55:07,967
[SPEAKER_16]: We actually have administrative meetings tomorrow morning.

1277
01:55:08,067 --> 01:55:11,831
[SPEAKER_16]: So this information will be disseminated to the administrators tomorrow.

1278
01:55:12,791 --> 01:55:15,674
[SPEAKER_16]: And we will ask them to disseminate it to their families.

1279
01:55:16,663 --> 01:55:26,927
[SPEAKER_16]: It's gonna go on our website, it'll go on the blog, it'll go on the other communication that routinely goes out to parents so that they know about those information sessions that begin on March 3rd.

1280
01:55:28,387 --> 01:55:36,210
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, so I'd like to make a motion that something central comes from the district no later than February 14th.

1281
01:55:37,509 --> 01:55:56,556
[SPEAKER_19]: that includes a number of items just so that families who may not have been paying attention to this last year because their kid was a distant fourth grader and now they're a fifth grader has some sort of backdrop information and some clarity in addition to the dates, which it's great that we have all of that stuff.

1282
01:55:56,576 --> 01:56:06,040
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'd like to see a communication that includes our rationale for the lottery process selection, a description and rationale of any student exemptions from the lottery,

1283
01:56:06,998 --> 01:56:13,763
[SPEAKER_19]: An outline of all lottery pools, including school-specific breakdowns and sub-lotteries for students on IEPs and 504s if they apply.

1284
01:56:14,304 --> 01:56:16,385
[SPEAKER_19]: And then a schedule and timeline of key dates.

1285
01:56:17,066 --> 01:56:21,569
[SPEAKER_19]: I think a consistent communication with all of that information is super important.

1286
01:56:21,669 --> 01:56:25,092
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm making a motion to ask the district to do that.

1287
01:56:27,394 --> 01:56:29,195
[SPEAKER_27]: Do you have an extra copy of that for Emily?

1288
01:56:29,215 --> 01:56:29,796
[SPEAKER_27]: Yep.

1289
01:56:30,796 --> 01:56:33,619
[SPEAKER_27]: If you could just read that one more time so we can all digest it.

1290
01:56:33,679 --> 01:56:33,939
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

1291
01:56:36,269 --> 01:56:43,595
[SPEAKER_19]: So I make a motion that the district send a communication to all fifth grade families no later than February 14th, 2020 to outline the lottery as follows.

1292
01:56:44,315 --> 01:56:47,178
[SPEAKER_19]: Number one, the rationale for lottery process of selection.

1293
01:56:47,658 --> 01:56:50,860
[SPEAKER_19]: Number two, a description and rationale of any student exemptions.

1294
01:56:51,501 --> 01:57:01,729
[SPEAKER_19]: Number three, an outline of all lottery pools, including school specific breakdowns and sub lotteries for students on IEPs or 504s if they exist, and a schedule and timeline of key dates.

1295
01:57:05,710 --> 01:57:07,331
[SPEAKER_27]: Approval by.

1296
01:57:08,911 --> 01:57:11,892
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, point of clarification member McLaughlin.

1297
01:57:12,192 --> 01:57:14,272
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you just point of clarification.

1298
01:57:14,312 --> 01:57:19,033
[SPEAKER_24]: Are you asking for this member Graham annually and then also for the sub lottery?

1299
01:57:19,073 --> 01:57:20,414
[SPEAKER_24]: Can you qualify what you mean by that?

1300
01:57:21,734 --> 01:57:25,195
[SPEAKER_19]: I think last year there was some conversation about.

1301
01:57:27,108 --> 01:57:40,339
[SPEAKER_19]: some students on IEPs were part of a separate lottery than the students without IEPs so that there was balancing happening, or 504 is potentially right.

1302
01:57:40,759 --> 01:57:45,883
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think if there are sub-lotteries, I just want people to clearly understand

1303
01:57:46,704 --> 01:57:58,067
[SPEAKER_19]: what those components and factors are so that when they get to the info session with you, they can come with informed questions.

1304
01:57:58,628 --> 01:58:04,929
[SPEAKER_19]: And if they can't get there, we have given them the top to bottom understanding of what our plan is.

1305
01:58:06,750 --> 01:58:11,433
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think this is such a huge improvement over the communication path of last year.

1306
01:58:11,453 --> 01:58:14,495
[SPEAKER_19]: As a fifth grade parent myself, thank you.

1307
01:58:14,515 --> 01:58:17,076
[SPEAKER_19]: And I get a lot of questions about this.

1308
01:58:17,136 --> 01:58:18,477
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's the motion.

1309
01:58:18,597 --> 01:58:20,779
[SPEAKER_19]: And so that's the clarification on that.

1310
01:58:21,579 --> 01:58:25,802
[SPEAKER_27]: Motion by member Graham, seconded by member McLaughlin.

1311
01:58:25,822 --> 01:58:26,802
[SPEAKER_27]: All those in favor?

1312
01:58:26,822 --> 01:58:28,183
[SPEAKER_27]: All those opposed?

1313
01:58:28,423 --> 01:58:29,504
[SPEAKER_27]: The motion passes.

1314
01:58:32,926 --> 01:58:34,527
[SPEAKER_27]: Your button was on, so I didn't know.

1315
01:58:36,837 --> 01:58:43,244
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes, and the rationale and the sub lottery, a lot of that was also explained in person.

1316
01:58:43,805 --> 01:58:51,894
[SPEAKER_32]: We had sample PowerPoints for every single school, so a lot of that, it's just

1317
01:58:53,355 --> 01:59:03,904
[SPEAKER_32]: packaging it, putting it together, but definitely to explain that what we were talking about, trying to get a greater balance between the schools, that did take place.

1318
01:59:03,964 --> 01:59:07,227
[SPEAKER_32]: So that's something that I would gladly provide.

1319
01:59:14,946 --> 01:59:15,987
[SPEAKER_19]: member Graham.

1320
01:59:16,767 --> 01:59:31,814
[SPEAKER_19]: I would also like to make a motion that we refer our middle school lottery process to the communications community engagement and strategic planning subcommittee for a view of our current communications and onboarding practices related to middle school selection.

1321
01:59:32,875 --> 01:59:42,540
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd like to further ask that the subcommittee report back to the school committee no later than October 31st of 2020 with any recommendations for the upcoming school year.

1322
01:59:42,560 --> 01:59:43,060
[SPEAKER_19]: Great.

1323
01:59:43,834 --> 01:59:50,619
[SPEAKER_27]: Great, motion by Member Graham, seconded by... Everybody, yep.

1324
01:59:51,159 --> 01:59:51,879
[SPEAKER_27]: Member Kreatz.

1325
01:59:52,660 --> 02:00:02,967
[SPEAKER_27]: And that subcommittee, Engagement, Communication, and Strategic Planning is chaired by Member Graham, also Member Kreatz, and Member McLaughlin serve on that committee.

1326
02:00:03,447 --> 02:00:04,128
[SPEAKER_27]: All those in favor?

1327
02:00:04,888 --> 02:00:05,709
[SPEAKER_27]: All those opposed?

1328
02:00:06,229 --> 02:00:06,990
[SPEAKER_27]: Paper passes.

1329
02:00:09,011 --> 02:00:09,311
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

1330
02:00:09,331 --> 02:00:10,332
[SPEAKER_27]: You're welcome.

1331
02:00:11,173 --> 02:00:11,833
[SPEAKER_27]: Dr. Cadelli.

1332
02:00:13,925 --> 02:00:16,669
[SPEAKER_27]: report on building bridges to kindergarten.

1333
02:00:16,689 --> 02:00:16,729
[SPEAKER_27]: Ms.

1334
02:00:17,089 --> 02:00:17,931
[SPEAKER_27]: Diane Caldwell.

1335
02:00:18,992 --> 02:00:19,493
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening.

1336
02:00:21,155 --> 02:00:22,597
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's that time of year again.

1337
02:00:22,637 --> 02:00:26,583
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to get our kindergartners or our pre-kindergarteners ready for

1338
02:00:27,276 --> 02:00:28,256
[SPEAKER_08]: our kindergarten.

1339
02:00:28,816 --> 02:00:33,738
[SPEAKER_08]: Medford Public Schools will begin the registration process the week of March 4th.

1340
02:00:34,318 --> 02:00:46,661
[SPEAKER_08]: Informational packets with required documentation for registration will be available on the Medford Public Schools website or in our Parent Information Center at Medford High School by mid-February.

1341
02:00:47,461 --> 02:00:51,242
[SPEAKER_08]: In addition, we will present building bridges to kindergarten on the following dates.

1342
02:00:52,042 --> 02:01:06,787
[SPEAKER_08]: Thursday, March 4th, from 6.30 to 7.30 at Medford High School, Tuesday, April 7th, from 6.30 to 7.30 at Medford High School, and on Wednesday, April 29th, from 6.30 to 7.30 at the Columbus Elementary School.

1343
02:01:09,767 --> 02:01:15,909
[SPEAKER_08]: Marie Cassidy from Medford Family Network will offer childcare services on March 4th and on April 7th.

1344
02:01:16,850 --> 02:01:18,610
[SPEAKER_08]: Parents should contact Marie at 781-393-2142

1345
02:01:22,347 --> 02:01:30,329
[SPEAKER_08]: or email her at mcassidy at medford.k12.ma.us if they require these services.

1346
02:01:32,610 --> 02:01:39,472
[SPEAKER_08]: The Columbus Elementary School will host a building bridges to kindergarten on Wednesday, April 29th from 630 to 730.

1347
02:01:40,712 --> 02:01:45,493
[SPEAKER_08]: And if parents need childcare, they can contact Kathleen Kay at 393-2177.

1348
02:01:48,152 --> 02:01:51,475
[SPEAKER_08]: or at kk.method.k12.ma.us.

1349
02:01:52,276 --> 02:02:00,404
[SPEAKER_08]: A letter will be sent home at the end of February reminding parents to register for child care prior to the building bridges to kindergarten.

1350
02:02:01,325 --> 02:02:09,533
[SPEAKER_08]: As always, Marie Michelli, who is a veteran kindergarten teacher at the Brooks School, will do a PowerPoint presentation at all three

1351
02:02:10,117 --> 02:02:20,821
[SPEAKER_08]: presentations where she'll discuss the curriculum, busing, before and after school programs, and answer any questions that parents might have.

1352
02:02:22,465 --> 02:02:29,090
[SPEAKER_08]: Meghan Fidler-Carey, who is our director of before and after school program, will begin registration the week of March 30th.

1353
02:02:29,871 --> 02:02:37,378
[SPEAKER_08]: And in her efforts to make the registration process more accessible, Meghan will be meeting at each elementary school.

1354
02:02:38,098 --> 02:02:43,343
[SPEAKER_08]: She is finalizing the dates and times and will provide this information by mid-February.

1355
02:02:44,484 --> 02:02:46,706
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that I spoke to Meghan earlier today

1356
02:02:47,395 --> 02:02:53,939
[SPEAKER_08]: She is trying to streamline the process because last year there were many questions about long lines at Medford High School.

1357
02:02:54,439 --> 02:02:57,601
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is the reason why she's going to each school individually.

1358
02:02:58,121 --> 02:03:04,384
[SPEAKER_08]: She's also looking into doing a lottery process so it's a little more equitable for our kiddos and families.

1359
02:03:05,465 --> 02:03:12,929
[SPEAKER_08]: Kindergarten open house is going to be on Wednesday, May 6th at each of our elementary schools from 2 to 3 o'clock.

1360
02:03:13,469 --> 02:03:16,371
[SPEAKER_08]: Each family will receive a welcome to kindergarten packet.

1361
02:03:16,670 --> 02:03:20,931
[SPEAKER_08]: This is something that we do every single school year at each elementary school.

1362
02:03:21,951 --> 02:03:25,552
[SPEAKER_08]: So in your packet, there's a copy of a registration form.

1363
02:03:25,572 --> 02:03:29,493
[SPEAKER_08]: There's the flyer for building bridges to kindergarten.

1364
02:03:30,453 --> 02:03:39,575
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the back page is a letter from Toni Wray about what is required for our entering kindergartners for health.

1365
02:03:40,815 --> 02:03:42,336
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm happy to answer any questions.

1366
02:03:42,356 --> 02:03:42,736
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1367
02:03:42,756 --> 02:03:43,236
[SPEAKER_08]: Member McLaughlin.

1368
02:03:44,636 --> 02:03:48,277
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Assistant Superintendent Caldwell for this report.

1369
02:03:49,898 --> 02:03:50,878
[SPEAKER_24]: And the flyer looks great.

1370
02:03:50,898 --> 02:03:54,159
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm happy to see the child care interpreter available by request.

1371
02:03:54,859 --> 02:04:04,382
[SPEAKER_24]: And I really appreciate at the bottom of the flyer for the Medford Family Network that the interpretation services are actually offered in the language.

1372
02:04:05,027 --> 02:04:08,448
[SPEAKER_24]: of folks, or at least three of the languages folks.

1373
02:04:08,468 --> 02:04:11,969
[SPEAKER_24]: So I'm wondering, can that information also be shared on our website if it's not already?

1374
02:04:11,989 --> 02:04:13,470
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it will all be shared on the website.

1375
02:04:13,530 --> 02:04:16,751
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, so in the language that folks need for the number?

1376
02:04:16,771 --> 02:04:16,831
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

1377
02:04:16,891 --> 02:04:17,331
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, great.

1378
02:04:17,771 --> 02:04:28,874
[SPEAKER_24]: And then for the health department document, folks will get that translated as needed based on whether they let you know that they need translation?

1379
02:04:28,894 --> 02:04:29,134
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.

1380
02:04:29,174 --> 02:04:31,135
[SPEAKER_08]: The evening presentations, we actually have

1381
02:04:32,011 --> 02:04:35,574
[SPEAKER_08]: people who can translate there at the meetings in case our families need that.

1382
02:04:35,874 --> 02:04:36,775
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, thank you.

1383
02:04:37,015 --> 02:04:37,495
[SPEAKER_08]: You're welcome.

1384
02:04:38,075 --> 02:04:38,536
[SPEAKER_27]: Member Graham.

1385
02:04:38,556 --> 02:04:42,679
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for this report.

1386
02:04:43,099 --> 02:04:44,480
[SPEAKER_19]: Just a couple of quick questions.

1387
02:04:45,521 --> 02:04:57,690
[SPEAKER_19]: Are all the forms that are needed on our website, it seemed like as I read this, that the caregiver authorization affidavit is not on the website, but available in the Parent Information Center only?

1388
02:04:59,457 --> 02:05:00,658
[SPEAKER_08]: I can check on that for you.

1389
02:05:00,858 --> 02:05:01,479
[SPEAKER_08]: Perfect.

1390
02:05:01,639 --> 02:05:02,099
[SPEAKER_08]: Caregiver?

1391
02:05:02,460 --> 02:05:05,542
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, the caregiver authorization affidavit.

1392
02:05:05,982 --> 02:05:06,823
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1393
02:05:07,443 --> 02:05:13,607
[SPEAKER_19]: And then just a couple of other things about the form that sort of prompted some questions.

1394
02:05:13,747 --> 02:05:25,776
[SPEAKER_19]: So when we talk about school assignment, perhaps we can provide a more precise web link than medfordpublicschools.org because I think once they land there, it's not

1395
02:05:26,363 --> 02:05:33,085
[SPEAKER_19]: particularly clear how they would get to that listing of streets and school assignments.

1396
02:05:33,185 --> 02:05:36,126
[SPEAKER_19]: So there's probably a more precise path.

1397
02:05:36,146 --> 02:05:37,326
[SPEAKER_08]: There is a street listing.

1398
02:05:37,346 --> 02:05:39,207
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you saying it's not on the website?

1399
02:05:39,347 --> 02:05:44,829
[SPEAKER_19]: No, what I'm saying is this instructs people to go to www.medfordpublicschools.org.

1400
02:05:45,669 --> 02:05:49,590
[SPEAKER_19]: They would then have to hunt to get to the street listing.

1401
02:05:50,820 --> 02:05:52,922
[SPEAKER_19]: So if we if exactly so.

1402
02:05:53,623 --> 02:05:58,669
[SPEAKER_19]: So I just want to make sure that we can provide sort of a clear path for people.

1403
02:06:00,732 --> 02:06:04,797
[SPEAKER_19]: And then the flyer also says our after school program is first come first serve.

1404
02:06:05,635 --> 02:06:08,657
[SPEAKER_19]: And it sounds like that may not entirely be true.

1405
02:06:08,757 --> 02:06:10,818
[SPEAKER_08]: That may not entirely be true right now.

1406
02:06:11,018 --> 02:06:12,779
[SPEAKER_08]: In the past, that's what it had been.

1407
02:06:13,419 --> 02:06:17,541
[SPEAKER_08]: But Megan's looking to streamline it, line it, and make it more equitable.

1408
02:06:17,622 --> 02:06:19,943
[SPEAKER_08]: And so she may be changing the process.

1409
02:06:20,123 --> 02:06:27,627
[SPEAKER_19]: So can we make sure that this flyer is updated so that it at least doesn't lead us down a path that is inaccurate potentially?

1410
02:06:27,647 --> 02:06:29,048
[SPEAKER_19]: She's doing that right now as we speak.

1411
02:06:29,108 --> 02:06:30,248
[SPEAKER_19]: OK, perfect.

1412
02:06:31,109 --> 02:06:31,649
[SPEAKER_19]: And then the

1413
02:06:35,676 --> 02:06:50,147
[SPEAKER_19]: Other comment that I had about the process in general is there's just been a tremendous amount of discussion about kindergarten in the last few weeks all over social media and specifically there are a large number of parents weighing charter schools versus Medford public schools.

1414
02:06:51,308 --> 02:07:00,335
[SPEAKER_19]: This is happening in particular this year because some surrounding communities are at their charter caps so now Medford families are being selected in the lottery in larger numbers than in the past.

1415
02:07:00,956 --> 02:07:05,198
[SPEAKER_19]: I believe some families have already had to commit to a charter based on the charter school's deadlines.

1416
02:07:05,919 --> 02:07:10,201
[SPEAKER_19]: And all this has happened prior to any rollout of our kindergarten related communication.

1417
02:07:11,042 --> 02:07:17,926
[SPEAKER_19]: The questions from families, from new families are similar at this year, year over year over year at this time.

1418
02:07:18,826 --> 02:07:23,529
[SPEAKER_19]: But one recurring thing that I continue to hear and I get emails about all the time is that

1419
02:07:24,147 --> 02:07:33,999
[SPEAKER_19]: Medford does not seem to be super responsive to parent inquiries and requests for information or even tours of the schools outside of this official kindergarten rollout.

1420
02:07:35,300 --> 02:07:39,786
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's not allowing us to put our best foot forward and I think we have a really great

1421
02:07:40,205 --> 02:07:45,826
[SPEAKER_19]: best foot to put forward at the right time when parents are making kindergarten decisions.

1422
02:07:46,346 --> 02:07:57,369
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think a question that I have for you is what are our protocols and policies around fielding requests for information from incoming families as well as tours?

1423
02:07:59,529 --> 02:08:04,770
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would have to say I think that we're pretty informative to any parent who makes phone calls.

1424
02:08:06,130 --> 02:08:08,231
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't get too many phone calls in my office.

1425
02:08:09,592 --> 02:08:12,614
[SPEAKER_08]: Maria Ibrahim maybe get some at the Parent Information Center.

1426
02:08:13,375 --> 02:08:15,417
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'd like to speak for the principals if I may.

1427
02:08:16,998 --> 02:08:27,667
[SPEAKER_08]: They are, if someone calls a principal and says that they're thinking about looking into going to that school, our principals will say to them that we'd be happy to talk to you.

1428
02:08:28,508 --> 02:08:30,109
[SPEAKER_08]: Would you like to come in and visit?

1429
02:08:30,510 --> 02:08:32,892
[SPEAKER_08]: There may be some problems around

1430
02:08:33,867 --> 02:08:45,434
[SPEAKER_08]: the timing of the visits but our schools are very welcoming and I know that all of the principals would say we're happy to give you a tour of the school and show you what it's like.

1431
02:08:46,134 --> 02:08:58,782
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm not sure where that is coming from but as early as sometimes December and January we get phone calls and I'm sure that our principals always are responsive to their needs.

1432
02:08:59,691 --> 02:09:01,933
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm not hearing that.

1433
02:09:02,834 --> 02:09:09,378
[SPEAKER_19]: And of course, I'm assuming that that is happening in some cases, but I think there's a number of cases where that is also not happening.

1434
02:09:10,359 --> 02:09:19,686
[SPEAKER_19]: So I guess the question is, if we are hearing from families who are saying, I reached out in some way and I didn't get a response, who should we direct those folks to?

1435
02:09:19,706 --> 02:09:23,069
[SPEAKER_08]: So it would be helpful for me to know to whom they reached out.

1436
02:09:23,769 --> 02:09:28,793
[SPEAKER_08]: So if they said, I reached out to the associate superintendent and she never called me back,

1437
02:09:29,451 --> 02:09:30,191
[SPEAKER_08]: then I would know.

1438
02:09:31,332 --> 02:09:33,893
[SPEAKER_08]: But I would need to know who that person might be.

1439
02:09:35,053 --> 02:09:38,654
[SPEAKER_08]: It's hard for me to even think that our principals would not be responsive.

1440
02:09:39,775 --> 02:09:41,075
[SPEAKER_19]: And I agree.

1441
02:09:41,155 --> 02:09:43,736
[SPEAKER_19]: I've never personally had that experience.

1442
02:09:44,916 --> 02:09:50,418
[SPEAKER_19]: However, I've seen it and been contacted by lots of people who have had that experience.

1443
02:09:50,839 --> 02:09:57,361
[SPEAKER_19]: And I just want to make sure that, particularly in that super anxious time, especially for our first time families, that

1444
02:09:58,561 --> 02:10:11,827
[SPEAKER_19]: they get to see in action how amazing our programs are before they are forced to make decisions to go somewhere else that may not necessarily be the best fit.

1445
02:10:11,927 --> 02:10:23,971
[SPEAKER_19]: So whether that is or not is I think for parents to decide in that context, but I also want to make sure that they don't make those decisions because they couldn't hear from us or get their questions answered.

1446
02:10:23,991 --> 02:10:27,513
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I would hope that they would at least contact me because that's

1447
02:10:28,191 --> 02:10:29,052
[SPEAKER_08]: Where am I for is?

1448
02:10:29,132 --> 02:10:29,412
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1449
02:10:29,773 --> 02:10:30,013
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1450
02:10:30,253 --> 02:10:34,197
[SPEAKER_19]: So when people reach out to me, I will make sure that I direct them to you in the future.

1451
02:10:35,078 --> 02:10:44,028
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, and then I also would like to make the motion that we refer our kindergarten orientation practices to the communications community engagement and strategic planning subcommittee for review.

1452
02:10:44,688 --> 02:10:50,755
[SPEAKER_19]: The subcommittee will review current communication and community engagement practices related to kindergarten orientation.

1453
02:10:51,696 --> 02:11:00,022
[SPEAKER_19]: And the subcommittee will report or recommend any revisions to the current plan and approach to the school committee here by no later than September 30th of 2020.

1454
02:11:04,886 --> 02:11:05,486
[SPEAKER_27]: Member Ruseau.

1455
02:11:06,047 --> 02:11:06,447
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

1456
02:11:06,467 --> 02:11:11,991
[SPEAKER_34]: I mean, I also have received these and again, it's not my experience with the principals either.

1457
02:11:12,872 --> 02:11:19,277
[SPEAKER_34]: I think that, you know, the day of, I've seen enough of what a principal has to do to know that it's a,

1458
02:11:19,895 --> 02:11:23,736
[SPEAKER_34]: remarkable job that I wouldn't do for all the money in the world.

1459
02:11:24,977 --> 02:11:38,961
[SPEAKER_34]: And, you know, there's fires starting up every day in every building, not literal fires, you know, emergencies and crises that you have to deal with.

1460
02:11:39,221 --> 02:11:47,243
[SPEAKER_34]: And I do dislike very much that we have to have the conversation that not prioritizing these incoming kindergarten parents or potential kindergarten parents

1461
02:11:47,844 --> 02:11:56,408
[SPEAKER_34]: who are being very actively recruited is going to cost us $12,700 a year for 13 years.

1462
02:11:57,509 --> 02:12:01,811
[SPEAKER_34]: None of us are going to have an easier job in any of our buildings if we keep losing more and more kids.

1463
02:12:03,052 --> 02:12:15,018
[SPEAKER_34]: And I just hate the idea that we have to say, you know, the message needs to be crystal clear from the administration down to the principals that these people need to be prioritized like, you know,

1464
02:12:16,004 --> 02:12:17,565
[SPEAKER_34]: like the governor's at your front door.

1465
02:12:18,146 --> 02:12:20,748
[SPEAKER_34]: It's like, because it's so much money.

1466
02:12:21,248 --> 02:12:29,495
[SPEAKER_34]: And they're making their choices on their first kid, and they have four kids, all four are gonna go there, and it's just, we can't get them back.

1467
02:12:29,996 --> 02:12:31,317
[SPEAKER_34]: It's just so much money.

1468
02:12:32,098 --> 02:12:35,500
[SPEAKER_34]: And I know it's, in your day-to-day lives as principals, it's,

1469
02:12:37,615 --> 02:13:06,469
[SPEAKER_34]: There's kids here now, and there's real problems you have to deal with, and worrying about a kid that may or may not show up in September seems hard to prioritize, but we are losing so much money to the charter schools, so I just wanna urge everybody to sort of repeat this over and over again, that we have to have an incredibly robust and very, very strict protocol around,

1470
02:13:07,202 --> 02:13:16,929
[SPEAKER_34]: kindergarten parent is interested, we need to respond in a very, very like excessive way almost, in my opinion.

1471
02:13:17,350 --> 02:13:17,590
[SPEAKER_34]: So.

1472
02:13:18,591 --> 02:13:18,871
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1473
02:13:20,052 --> 02:13:20,352
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

1474
02:13:20,372 --> 02:13:21,453
[SPEAKER_27]: Member Van der Kloot.

1475
02:13:24,832 --> 02:13:26,213
[SPEAKER_18]: I support the resolution.

1476
02:13:26,713 --> 02:13:36,840
[SPEAKER_18]: It sounds like where we're heading is that we're going to need to do some specialized preschool information directed to preschool parents.

1477
02:13:36,980 --> 02:13:39,021
[SPEAKER_18]: Especially, we have the Medford Family Network.

1478
02:13:39,061 --> 02:13:41,643
[SPEAKER_18]: We have parents we can outreach to.

1479
02:13:42,383 --> 02:13:52,630
[SPEAKER_18]: And I know one year I went and I was very disheartened by how many of those parents, it just happened that year, were going to charter schools.

1480
02:13:53,214 --> 02:14:01,984
[SPEAKER_18]: So it seems like with the feedback from my colleagues that it's definitely time to think about an earlier outreach.

1481
02:14:02,384 --> 02:14:04,306
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that these presentations are great.

1482
02:14:04,466 --> 02:14:07,790
[SPEAKER_18]: I know the staff does a fabulous job on them.

1483
02:14:08,491 --> 02:14:12,175
[SPEAKER_18]: But clearly, we're going to need to think about sooner.

1484
02:14:13,116 --> 02:14:13,276
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure.

1485
02:14:15,069 --> 02:14:15,749
[SPEAKER_27]: Member McLaughlin.

1486
02:14:16,890 --> 02:14:18,191
[SPEAKER_24]: I also support the resolution.

1487
02:14:18,251 --> 02:14:18,631
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1488
02:14:18,651 --> 02:14:24,094
[SPEAKER_24]: I just, um, I'm wondering though, um, um, assistant superintendent call.

1489
02:14:24,114 --> 02:14:29,377
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, do we have data on how many kindergartners there are and how many were actually

1490
02:14:30,461 --> 02:14:33,082
[SPEAKER_24]: are choosing Medford Public Schools or choosing other schools?

1491
02:14:33,722 --> 02:14:34,802
[SPEAKER_24]: Do we even know that?

1492
02:14:35,382 --> 02:14:39,723
[SPEAKER_08]: We have data on, of course, the people that are coming, the children who are coming to us.

1493
02:14:40,983 --> 02:14:44,524
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have any data of children going off to charter schools.

1494
02:14:44,544 --> 02:14:44,684
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

1495
02:14:44,984 --> 02:14:48,425
[SPEAKER_24]: So we don't even know, really, how much money we may or may not be losing, or do we?

1496
02:14:48,645 --> 02:14:48,905
[SPEAKER_28]: We do.

1497
02:14:49,245 --> 02:14:49,505
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, we do.

1498
02:14:50,566 --> 02:14:51,866
[SPEAKER_24]: Because we have to pay it, right?

1499
02:14:52,686 --> 02:14:53,006
[SPEAKER_24]: Right.

1500
02:14:53,166 --> 02:14:53,706
[SPEAKER_24]: So we know.

1501
02:14:54,987 --> 02:14:57,927
[SPEAKER_24]: So are we getting retroactive data on that?

1502
02:14:58,108 --> 02:14:58,908
[SPEAKER_24]: That's what I'm asking.

1503
02:14:59,168 --> 02:14:59,888
[SPEAKER_24]: Not to my knowledge.

1504
02:15:00,262 --> 02:15:02,564
[SPEAKER_24]: No, that would be interesting too.

1505
02:15:07,568 --> 02:15:09,130
[SPEAKER_24]: But it would be good for the school committee to know.

1506
02:15:10,891 --> 02:15:23,301
[SPEAKER_24]: And frankly, the staff and assistant superintendent and principals, if we're talking about what these numbers really are translating into, and people should know how great our schools are, because we do, right?

1507
02:15:23,321 --> 02:15:24,603
[SPEAKER_08]: We definitely do.

1508
02:15:24,643 --> 02:15:24,963
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1509
02:15:25,023 --> 02:15:25,283
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1510
02:15:25,423 --> 02:15:25,743
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

1511
02:15:27,265 --> 02:15:27,525
[SPEAKER_24]: OK.

1512
02:15:28,125 --> 02:15:28,606
[SPEAKER_34]: Member Ruseau.

1513
02:15:29,349 --> 02:15:40,279
[SPEAKER_34]: I believe we know exactly how many students for each grade level, because while we're not actually cutting a check, we know because we didn't get the check from the state.

1514
02:15:40,379 --> 02:15:42,001
[SPEAKER_34]: So we know exactly that information.

1515
02:15:42,081 --> 02:15:46,585
[SPEAKER_34]: I believe it's even reported on the DESE website, although I'm not sure it's broken down by grade level.

1516
02:15:47,626 --> 02:15:47,847
[SPEAKER_34]: Ms.

1517
02:15:47,907 --> 02:15:50,169
[SPEAKER_34]: Patterson may actually know that.

1518
02:15:52,162 --> 02:15:57,346
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, so the charter information is provided annually, and that is through the DESE portal.

1519
02:15:57,466 --> 02:16:06,612
[SPEAKER_22]: It is not active for any member of the community to just go and review, but we do have that access and that ability to poll by grade level.

1520
02:16:07,113 --> 02:16:13,898
[SPEAKER_22]: It's also noteworthy to understand that we have done outreach to the preschools that we did over the summer.

1521
02:16:14,398 --> 02:16:19,662
[SPEAKER_22]: We have been engaging at that level to reach out to our local

1522
02:16:20,643 --> 02:16:24,926
[SPEAKER_22]: preschool providers in order to get the message out about Medford Public Schools.

1523
02:16:24,986 --> 02:16:31,549
[SPEAKER_22]: We've done flyers to the households that have identified and focused on the elementary schools themselves.

1524
02:16:32,030 --> 02:16:49,380
[SPEAKER_22]: So there has been outreach and we do continue to monitor this and try to actively reach out to those families that this is not a new issue, a new item, but we are certainly reviewing that and trying to put our resources towards again, maybe not

1525
02:16:50,137 --> 02:17:00,648
[SPEAKER_22]: recapturing those that are already there, but trying to send the message of the greatness of Medford Public Schools for those that are on the cusp of making a decision.

1526
02:17:03,331 --> 02:17:03,672
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1527
02:17:05,293 --> 02:17:05,934
[SPEAKER_27]: Member McLaughlin?

1528
02:17:08,072 --> 02:17:24,439
[SPEAKER_24]: Just a point of clarification, since the data is available or if it's available, that it could be referred to the subcommittee on this matter so that we could further drill down into that as we're making some planning.

1529
02:17:26,279 --> 02:17:32,482
[SPEAKER_27]: Member Graham, would you mind reading your resolution one more time and we can vote on it?

1530
02:17:35,299 --> 02:17:44,722
[SPEAKER_19]: So I make a motion that the school committee refers our kindergarten orientation practices to the communications, community engagement, and strategic planning subcommittee for review.

1531
02:17:45,222 --> 02:17:51,224
[SPEAKER_19]: The subcommittee will also review current communication and community engagement practices related to kindergarten orientation.

1532
02:17:51,624 --> 02:17:55,846
[SPEAKER_19]: The subcommittee will recommend revisions to the current plan and approach to the school committee by September 30, 2020.

1533
02:17:57,264 --> 02:17:57,924
[SPEAKER_27]: Perfect, thank you.

1534
02:17:58,205 --> 02:18:05,448
[SPEAKER_27]: Motion by Member Graham, seconded by... That was a tie.

1535
02:18:06,229 --> 02:18:08,250
[SPEAKER_27]: Member McLaughlin.

1536
02:18:09,110 --> 02:18:10,091
[SPEAKER_27]: All those in favor?

1537
02:18:10,751 --> 02:18:11,552
[SPEAKER_27]: All those opposed?

1538
02:18:12,792 --> 02:18:13,493
[SPEAKER_27]: Motion passes.

1539
02:18:15,734 --> 02:18:16,094
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

1540
02:18:18,556 --> 02:18:22,898
[SPEAKER_27]: Report on draft of strategic plan by Dr. Maurice-Edouard Vincent.

1541
02:18:32,987 --> 02:18:34,742
[SPEAKER_31]: Oh, I'm going to slide, okay.

1542
02:19:07,842 --> 02:19:19,987
[SPEAKER_32]: As the PowerPoint is being pulled up, I wanted to just share that this draft strategic plan has been a compilation of work that has taken place over the past year.

1543
02:19:21,968 --> 02:19:28,190
[SPEAKER_32]: This work has been comprised of a diverse group of our district administrators.

1544
02:19:29,891 --> 02:19:37,294
[SPEAKER_32]: And in order to create this plan, we're going to show it to you through a PowerPoint slide deck.

1545
02:19:40,053 --> 02:19:42,815
[SPEAKER_32]: And I'm going to just highlight some of our key points.

1546
02:19:44,236 --> 02:19:51,422
[SPEAKER_32]: I do want to make mention that a lot of the research from this refers back to my work with NISP.

1547
02:19:53,583 --> 02:19:59,928
[SPEAKER_32]: And in NISP, it's actually officially referred to as a strategy for district improvement.

1548
02:20:00,809 --> 02:20:04,712
[SPEAKER_32]: And we've abbreviated it to call it our strategic plan.

1549
02:20:05,796 --> 02:20:29,613
[SPEAKER_32]: The supporting documentation, as you can see, has been built upon our Medford Public Schools District Improvement Plans, existing DESE data, city and district surveys, district administrators' feedback, the Mayor's Education Transition Subcommittee meeting,

1550
02:20:30,831 --> 02:20:37,739
[SPEAKER_32]: that took place at the McGlynn School and the Medford Mayoral Transition Committee recommendations.

1551
02:20:38,961 --> 02:20:44,007
[SPEAKER_32]: I do want to say that as this presentation takes place, I was going to hope that

1552
02:20:44,724 --> 02:20:57,992
[SPEAKER_32]: you would allow the entire team, as diverse administrators that you see here this evening, for us to be able to present the overview in full.

1553
02:20:58,712 --> 02:21:10,840
[SPEAKER_32]: And then at the conclusion of our presentation that you can ask all of us questions because many of your questions may be responded, answered in the presentation that takes place.

1554
02:21:17,315 --> 02:21:33,026
[SPEAKER_32]: The genesis of this plan, again, as I started to say, was from our new superintendent's induction program, which is a three-year program that I am part of in a cohort of 40 superintendents across the Commonwealth.

1555
02:21:35,408 --> 02:21:45,575
[SPEAKER_32]: This is a compilation and a reinvention of our existing Medford Public Schools district improvement plans.

1556
02:21:48,309 --> 02:21:55,592
[SPEAKER_32]: The data also took place from leadership retreats and meetings that have taken place over the past year.

1557
02:21:56,833 --> 02:22:15,482
[SPEAKER_32]: And this cross-disciplinary team of administrators that are here this evening, they represent both elementary, actually all, elementary, middle, and high school levels, special education, social emotional learning, curriculum, and central office.

1558
02:22:19,545 --> 02:22:30,228
[SPEAKER_32]: Our core values, when I came to Medford Public Schools, I talked about my core values of ACE, achievement, collaboration, and equity.

1559
02:22:31,368 --> 02:22:41,011
[SPEAKER_32]: Over the course of this year and working with the team, we've expanded that core value

1560
02:22:41,772 --> 02:22:44,153
[SPEAKER_32]: to also incorporate support.

1561
02:22:45,054 --> 02:22:58,281
[SPEAKER_32]: And this evening, as we give you the overview, you will see that our pillars, our core values, our achievement, collaboration, equity, and support.

1562
02:23:02,764 --> 02:23:06,646
[SPEAKER_32]: To give you an overview on achievement this evening,

1563
02:23:07,270 --> 02:23:16,655
[SPEAKER_32]: We have both Dr. Riccadeli and Headmaster Paul DeLeva, who are going to give you an overview of what achievement is all about.

1564
02:23:18,536 --> 02:23:19,436
[SPEAKER_32]: Is it possible to?

1565
02:23:27,337 --> 02:23:27,838
[SPEAKER_16]: Good evening.

1566
02:23:28,498 --> 02:23:32,461
[SPEAKER_16]: So our first core value tonight is that of achievement.

1567
02:23:32,921 --> 02:23:36,923
[SPEAKER_16]: We are a school district and educating children is what we do.

1568
02:23:36,944 --> 02:23:38,825
[SPEAKER_16]: It's very important.

1569
02:23:39,365 --> 02:23:48,171
[SPEAKER_16]: So as a school district, educating our youth and providing them with a quality education that challenges them and nurtures their growth is paramount to our mission.

1570
02:23:48,671 --> 02:23:54,555
[SPEAKER_16]: And therefore, the A in ACE stands for the core value of achievement.

1571
02:23:56,280 --> 02:24:00,584
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you look at everything, we've broken down into objectives as well as initiatives.

1572
02:24:00,985 --> 02:24:19,122
[SPEAKER_04]: And our objective for achievement is Medford Public Schools will develop and implement cohesive district-wide curricula and instruction assessed through various methods designed to help learners reach their potential as knowledgeable, ethical, and critical thinking citizens.

1573
02:24:20,509 --> 02:24:30,413
[SPEAKER_16]: So when we look at achievement and we look at what's driving us, the following initiatives are what we worked on, what we think we need to pursue.

1574
02:24:31,093 --> 02:24:47,499
[SPEAKER_16]: So we want to pursue instruction that focuses on evidence-based responses, on productive struggle, that is making our students stretch in their learning, academic discourse and having those discussions that are fruitful and

1575
02:24:49,880 --> 02:24:52,403
[SPEAKER_16]: rich in academic content.

1576
02:24:53,484 --> 02:24:56,407
[SPEAKER_16]: We want them to be accessible for all.

1577
02:24:57,168 --> 02:24:59,851
[SPEAKER_16]: We want there to be rich feedback.

1578
02:25:00,251 --> 02:25:03,275
[SPEAKER_16]: So we call these five the five core actions.

1579
02:25:03,315 --> 02:25:06,218
[SPEAKER_16]: We've been doing a lot of professional development on the five core actions.

1580
02:25:06,518 --> 02:25:07,699
[SPEAKER_16]: We've been going into classes.

1581
02:25:07,739 --> 02:25:11,003
[SPEAKER_16]: We've been doing learning walks on these core actions.

1582
02:25:12,564 --> 02:25:19,669
[SPEAKER_16]: Teaching in this manner and this way of instruction is important as we implement the Massachusetts curriculum frameworks.

1583
02:25:20,776 --> 02:25:27,440
[SPEAKER_04]: If you look at the second initiative, provide instructional technology that meets the curricular needs of educators and learners.

1584
02:25:28,080 --> 02:25:31,602
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not just looking for instructional technology just for testing.

1585
02:25:32,143 --> 02:25:38,407
[SPEAKER_04]: In some cases, that's what we utilize it for, but we're also looking for ways to enhance our instructional practices.

1586
02:25:38,967 --> 02:25:47,112
[SPEAKER_04]: So that there are different, meeting the needs of everybody that can learn through different modes, medians, modalities, and all of that nature.

1587
02:25:48,755 --> 02:25:53,822
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's important that we assess what we're doing and having come assessments and having benchmarks.

1588
02:25:54,242 --> 02:26:05,016
[SPEAKER_16]: The development of the critically important so that we understand when we have success and when we need to try something else to reach success.

1589
02:26:06,906 --> 02:26:11,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Then the last initiative is to recruit and retain an effective and diverse staff.

1590
02:26:11,487 --> 02:26:24,410
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you look at the demographics in Medford, you want to make sure that you're having staff members that meet the needs of those students, depending of where their backgrounds are or their learning styles or anything like that.

1591
02:26:24,950 --> 02:26:30,571
[SPEAKER_04]: So we really want to hone in on recruiting and hiring staff here in Medford to meet those needs, those diverse needs.

1592
02:26:32,031 --> 02:26:40,894
[SPEAKER_16]: So one thing that is important that you haven't seen yet is that under the initiatives, you're going to see that it looks like it's hyperlinked, and it is hyperlinked.

1593
02:26:41,574 --> 02:26:50,257
[SPEAKER_16]: So the next step, and when we get to it, Assistant Superintendent Cushing is going to delve into that.

1594
02:26:50,317 --> 02:26:59,340
[SPEAKER_16]: So what you see are just the initiatives, but deeper into that, you're going to see that there really is a process, there's a template for each one of them.

1595
02:27:00,100 --> 02:27:00,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1596
02:27:06,161 --> 02:27:08,102
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm gonna speak to the collaboration.

1597
02:27:08,442 --> 02:27:12,665
[SPEAKER_09]: So one of the goals, our objective, is to foster collaborative relationships.

1598
02:27:13,425 --> 02:27:19,209
[SPEAKER_09]: So the Medford Public Schools will create a culture of collaboration through consistent community engagement.

1599
02:27:19,829 --> 02:27:28,214
[SPEAKER_09]: That is our goal, that is our objective, and we have several initiatives that we are going to propose in order to accomplish our objective.

1600
02:27:28,634 --> 02:27:33,417
[SPEAKER_09]: First one is to build mutually beneficial community partnerships in order to increase school effectiveness.

1601
02:27:34,616 --> 02:27:43,023
[SPEAKER_09]: The second one is to actively ensure that all families are welcome members of the school community who contribute to the classroom, school, and community effectiveness.

1602
02:27:44,124 --> 02:28:02,638
[SPEAKER_09]: The third one, which Dr. Cushing will delve into a little bit later on with a hyperlink, so this is one of the examples Dr. Riccadeli spoke to earlier that we are going to go ahead and present to, is to engage in timely, thoughtful, to a culturally proficient communication with the Medford Mustang community, and then finally,

1603
02:28:03,619 --> 02:28:09,767
[SPEAKER_09]: Our last initiative is to work collaboratively with community stakeholders to funnel appropriate budgetary resources.

1604
02:28:10,308 --> 02:28:14,713
[SPEAKER_09]: Once again, trying to work collaboratively with one another in order to get the best resources for our students.

1605
02:28:14,733 --> 02:28:18,939
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm going to turn it over to the E equity team.

1606
02:28:22,776 --> 02:28:25,137
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening, that would be me, Suzanne Galussi, Principal of the Brooks.

1607
02:28:26,138 --> 02:28:29,699
[SPEAKER_15]: The E in our ACES core objectives stands for equity.

1608
02:28:30,500 --> 02:28:34,662
[SPEAKER_15]: Within education, the term equity means that every student will get what they need.

1609
02:28:35,482 --> 02:28:47,648
[SPEAKER_15]: Therefore, Medford Public Schools fosters equitable learning environments by understanding the needs of our diverse population and supporting the academic, social, emotional, and physical needs of our students.

1610
02:28:48,468 --> 02:28:50,950
[SPEAKER_15]: We have four initiatives to address this objective.

1611
02:28:51,730 --> 02:28:54,635
[SPEAKER_15]: Please remember that these initiatives are a work in progress.

1612
02:28:55,496 --> 02:29:06,873
[SPEAKER_15]: So the first is to ensure equitable access through the implementation of the multi-tiered system of support and enrichment MTSSE, formerly known as RTI.

1613
02:29:08,328 --> 02:29:16,654
[SPEAKER_15]: To encompass a growth mindset, this initiative has expanded our focus beyond just RTI, which stands for response to intervention.

1614
02:29:17,614 --> 02:29:23,758
[SPEAKER_15]: So in other words, an MTSSE system is not just limited to interventions.

1615
02:29:24,599 --> 02:29:30,283
[SPEAKER_15]: It also focuses on meeting the social, emotional, and physical needs of our learners.

1616
02:29:32,199 --> 02:29:39,045
[SPEAKER_15]: The second initiative is to use data from ongoing assessments to support teaching and learning in order to close the achievement gap.

1617
02:29:39,725 --> 02:29:43,369
[SPEAKER_15]: This will be a comprehensive approach within school buildings and throughout the district.

1618
02:29:44,449 --> 02:29:50,034
[SPEAKER_15]: Promote and enhance the activities and resources that address the needs of the whole child.

1619
02:29:51,195 --> 02:29:56,700
[SPEAKER_15]: It should be noted that when addressing the needs of the whole child, we're looking at the complete picture of what that means.

1620
02:29:58,286 --> 02:30:04,310
[SPEAKER_15]: And that will encompass multiple intelligences, athletics, fine arts, et cetera.

1621
02:30:05,290 --> 02:30:07,692
[SPEAKER_15]: And to promote the health and wellness of students.

1622
02:30:08,492 --> 02:30:12,375
[SPEAKER_15]: When students are happy and healthy and their needs are met, they're ready to learn.

1623
02:30:13,455 --> 02:30:24,402
[SPEAKER_15]: And this segues beautifully into our final core value, the S of support, which Susanna Campbell and Stacey Shulman will discuss.

1624
02:30:28,897 --> 02:30:31,218
[SPEAKER_21]: Support is our foundational core value.

1625
02:30:32,058 --> 02:30:37,020
[SPEAKER_21]: Originally, we started with three core values, achievement, collaboration, and equity.

1626
02:30:38,001 --> 02:30:52,547
[SPEAKER_21]: We decided to add support as our foundational core value since we recognize that in order to meet our achievement, collaboration, and equity core value objectives, we must provide safe and supportive environments for our students.

1627
02:30:54,209 --> 02:31:07,234
[SPEAKER_21]: We considered Maslow's hierarchy of needs, which indicates that in order to achieve, individuals must have their more fundamental needs met, including food, safety, and a sense of belonging.

1628
02:31:08,494 --> 02:31:17,678
[SPEAKER_21]: Our team intentionally chose the color green for this level to represent a safe, calm, welcoming, and supportive learning environment.

1629
02:31:18,737 --> 02:31:32,789
[SPEAKER_21]: Our objective states, to foster a safe and supportive learning environment, Medford Public Schools will continually assess, review, and provide a safe, secure teaching and learning environment.

1630
02:31:33,389 --> 02:31:33,529
[SPEAKER_21]: Ms.

1631
02:31:33,549 --> 02:31:38,293
[SPEAKER_21]: Shulman will now review the initiatives that correspond to this core value.

1632
02:31:39,294 --> 02:31:39,795
[SPEAKER_20]: Good evening.

1633
02:31:39,975 --> 02:31:42,337
[SPEAKER_20]: Under support, we have five initiatives.

1634
02:31:43,311 --> 02:31:47,194
[SPEAKER_20]: The first is to continue to use and refine consistent safety protocols.

1635
02:31:48,155 --> 02:31:54,060
[SPEAKER_20]: Secondly, we have to increase supports and also the understanding for the social emotional needs of Medford students.

1636
02:31:55,541 --> 02:32:04,108
[SPEAKER_20]: We also have sustain and build upon partnerships with community safety stakeholders and use evidence-based practices to develop a positive school culture.

1637
02:32:04,929 --> 02:32:08,952
[SPEAKER_20]: Lastly, to audit and improve the physical infrastructure of all of our school buildings.

1638
02:32:10,199 --> 02:32:15,362
[SPEAKER_20]: Dr. Cushing will now provide an in-depth example of the action plans behind each of these initiatives.

1639
02:32:15,382 --> 02:32:35,213
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I'm handing out to you right now is a fully fleshed out document that expands upon the template that you have.

1640
02:32:46,949 --> 02:32:55,292
[SPEAKER_03]: So every single hyperlink that you see on the first page of the strategic plan leads to a specific action plan.

1641
02:32:56,233 --> 02:33:03,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Within that action plan, there is the header that lists 2020 to 2023 strategic plan phase one.

1642
02:33:03,895 --> 02:33:12,899
[SPEAKER_03]: So as we enter phase one, these are the primary objectives and initiatives that we see as fundamentally important.

1643
02:33:13,679 --> 02:33:19,487
[SPEAKER_03]: And so each one will have fostering collaborative relationships for this one, and this is initiative three.

1644
02:33:19,547 --> 02:33:20,868
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the third one listed.

1645
02:33:21,309 --> 02:33:23,812
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they will each list the initiative again.

1646
02:33:23,832 --> 02:33:26,135
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there are four critical elements here.

1647
02:33:26,235 --> 02:33:28,698
[SPEAKER_03]: So what are our early indicators of success?

1648
02:33:29,479 --> 02:33:30,701
[SPEAKER_03]: What are the resources needed?

1649
02:33:32,179 --> 02:33:34,401
[SPEAKER_03]: What are our anticipated or hoped outcomes?

1650
02:33:34,781 --> 02:33:36,203
[SPEAKER_03]: And who's the project manager?

1651
02:33:36,703 --> 02:33:44,911
[SPEAKER_03]: So who are we looking to to make sure that we're accountable for our initiatives and then the action items underneath?

1652
02:33:45,391 --> 02:33:48,054
[SPEAKER_03]: So here you can see early indicators of success quickly.

1653
02:33:48,474 --> 02:34:04,068
[SPEAKER_03]: establish a district marcom, marketing communications plan, establishing district controlled social media accounts, new website deployed, interestingly enough that just actually happened, and district wide smartphone application, something that is currently in the works.

1654
02:34:04,849 --> 02:34:09,673
[SPEAKER_03]: The resources needed, obviously financial appropriations, community input, social media sites,

1655
02:34:10,183 --> 02:34:17,931
[SPEAKER_03]: And SIMS, which stands for School Information, Student Information Management System Support and Training.

1656
02:34:18,171 --> 02:34:24,156
[SPEAKER_03]: So that ongoing training and support to basically use our SIMS system.

1657
02:34:25,518 --> 02:34:34,026
[SPEAKER_03]: And then our Anticipated Outcomes, Improved Experiences, Improved Communication with Caregivers and Stakeholders.

1658
02:34:34,567 --> 02:34:43,543
[SPEAKER_03]: increase trust and support, pick streamlined to onboard families quickly and seamlessly as possible.

1659
02:34:45,663 --> 02:34:47,864
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you move down to the lower portion of the page.

1660
02:34:48,684 --> 02:34:52,065
[SPEAKER_03]: This can be one page, it can be two pages, it's whatever the action items need.

1661
02:34:52,485 --> 02:34:58,966
[SPEAKER_03]: It gives specifically what the action item is, what the initial desired outputs are, who the responsibility is.

1662
02:35:00,367 --> 02:35:09,089
[SPEAKER_03]: We've gone with titles here to make sure that if there's transition, that we're not having to go back and change individuals, but we're focusing on titles.

1663
02:35:09,609 --> 02:35:13,170
[SPEAKER_03]: And then specific timelines for when things will be completed.

1664
02:35:13,730 --> 02:35:16,074
[SPEAKER_03]: or when major milestones should be met.

1665
02:35:17,316 --> 02:35:26,190
[SPEAKER_03]: It's focused, it's driven on outputs and timeliness, and once again, who's working underneath the overall project manager.

1666
02:35:27,648 --> 02:35:29,048
[SPEAKER_03]: to provide specifics.

1667
02:35:30,529 --> 02:35:32,689
[SPEAKER_03]: My eyesight in my later years is failing me.

1668
02:35:32,749 --> 02:35:37,930
[SPEAKER_03]: You have it right there, but you can see specifics of the things that we are fleshing out.

1669
02:35:38,991 --> 02:35:45,552
[SPEAKER_03]: This is like many that are at a good level of development.

1670
02:35:45,932 --> 02:35:53,394
[SPEAKER_03]: There are others that do need some work, but that we have been focusing on and have been working diligently on in the development.

1671
02:35:53,714 --> 02:35:54,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. DeLeva.

1672
02:35:56,555 --> 02:36:01,058
[SPEAKER_03]: So, in education, there's a lot of jargon and a lot of eduspeak.

1673
02:36:01,779 --> 02:36:12,466
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you'll notice on the very first page that you were given, down in the lower left hand corner, there's another hyperlink for a glossary of terms.

1674
02:36:13,167 --> 02:36:17,270
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this just gives you an example of the Medford eduspeak.

1675
02:36:18,271 --> 02:36:22,773
[SPEAKER_03]: glossary of terms that is being developed by members of our staff.

1676
02:36:22,813 --> 02:36:34,617
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been shared out with Toni Wray, with Jen Hollenbeck, with principals, with other directors, other people, and it will continue to be shared out so that we can refine and provide the best definition.

1677
02:36:34,817 --> 02:36:40,419
[SPEAKER_03]: One, let me give you one example of a very Medford specific that's up there is credit for life.

1678
02:36:41,020 --> 02:36:43,100
[SPEAKER_03]: So that has been shared out with Gail Trainor.

1679
02:36:43,120 --> 02:36:47,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Gail Trainor has provided a more in-depth definition than what is currently up there.

1680
02:36:48,422 --> 02:36:55,125
[SPEAKER_03]: as the online document is being continuously updated, and I know that she worked on that this past Friday.

1681
02:36:55,806 --> 02:37:14,434
[SPEAKER_03]: But so if people ask, what is a 504, what is a BCBA, what is an IEP later in the document, these things are defined specifically so that as people are reading the document, things that may come up, they don't have to go searching for in other places, they don't have to Google search, they can if they want, but it's provided for them.

1682
02:37:15,825 --> 02:37:24,951
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that gives us a real opportunity for transparency in our language and not to try to hide things in jargon.

1683
02:37:36,459 --> 02:37:42,403
[SPEAKER_32]: So what we have now is what are our next steps for engagement?

1684
02:37:43,570 --> 02:38:05,379
[SPEAKER_32]: As you can see, our core values are in the middle, and our intention for engagement is to engage all that's listed, to engage our subcommittee that will be addressing strategic planning, the school committee, our community at large, faculty and staff, caregivers, and school leaders.

1685
02:38:09,420 --> 02:38:28,076
[SPEAKER_32]: for collaboration, working together, making this a shared experience, a living document that we will all be able to refer to and to really make it something that when we talk about Medford Public Schools and we talk about our mustang country,

1686
02:38:29,016 --> 02:38:34,821
[SPEAKER_32]: that people will also be able to say that we represent ACES and what that stands for.

1687
02:38:35,701 --> 02:38:41,546
[SPEAKER_32]: We would like to market this widely and really have it owned by the entire community at large.

1688
02:38:46,150 --> 02:38:57,459
[SPEAKER_32]: And so our tagline for ACES, what we're committed to, our core values, our four pillars, our achievement, collaboration,

1689
02:38:58,470 --> 02:39:00,251
[SPEAKER_32]: equity, and support.

1690
02:39:03,093 --> 02:39:04,533
[SPEAKER_32]: I open the floor for questions.

1691
02:39:15,459 --> 02:39:18,281
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you very much, Superintendent, Administrators.

1692
02:39:19,102 --> 02:39:20,102
[SPEAKER_27]: Do we have any questions?

1693
02:39:20,542 --> 02:39:21,443
[SPEAKER_27]: Member Van der Kloot.

1694
02:39:22,335 --> 02:39:27,539
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, so thank you for all the work to the team who's been putting and working on this document.

1695
02:39:28,620 --> 02:39:40,909
[SPEAKER_18]: Just for our clarity, I believe my understanding is that for each of the bullets, you'd hyperlink to a page that would outline in detail the steps needed

1696
02:39:41,454 --> 02:39:45,757
[SPEAKER_18]: to achieve and the person in charge.

1697
02:39:47,178 --> 02:39:56,565
[SPEAKER_18]: Of the bullets that we have here, roughly 16, 17, how many have we done that next step for?

1698
02:39:56,585 --> 02:39:59,727
[SPEAKER_18]: Or is that the next step?

1699
02:40:05,040 --> 02:40:20,772
[SPEAKER_32]: So different initiatives are at different levels of completion as this is a fluid document in terms of initiatives that are taking place right now and initiatives that we would like to do in the future.

1700
02:40:22,093 --> 02:40:23,695
[SPEAKER_32]: So it is a fluid document.

1701
02:40:24,715 --> 02:40:32,061
[SPEAKER_32]: Some may be 80% completed, the sample that Dr. Cushing shared about

1702
02:40:34,119 --> 02:40:42,023
[SPEAKER_32]: two-way communication So they are at different levels of completion because we know that

1703
02:40:44,560 --> 02:41:11,367
[SPEAKER_32]: it is a fluid document it is a work in progress but again looking at all the data that was available and taking everything that Medford Public is doing and espouses to do and trying to bring it into one document where we're able to state our core values we're able to say this is the work that we're doing to have this be our guiding driving document as a district

1704
02:41:13,777 --> 02:41:17,860
[SPEAKER_32]: that I feel is the majority of the work that has taken place.

1705
02:41:18,081 --> 02:41:30,391
[SPEAKER_32]: And any member of this wonderfully gifted group of administrators that I get to work with, feel free to add to my remarks.

1706
02:41:32,012 --> 02:41:33,093
[SPEAKER_18]: If I can just follow up.

1707
02:41:33,793 --> 02:41:36,235
[SPEAKER_18]: Moving forward, what do you envision now?

1708
02:41:36,576 --> 02:41:39,598
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you envision it going to the subcommittee?

1709
02:41:41,044 --> 02:41:46,569
[SPEAKER_32]: So we do have professional development scheduled tomorrow with all administrators.

1710
02:41:47,250 --> 02:41:54,877
[SPEAKER_32]: This group of diverse administrators that you see here took on a lot of the

1711
02:41:56,599 --> 02:42:01,682
[SPEAKER_32]: the work of pulling together multiple initiatives and things that are taking place in the district.

1712
02:42:01,782 --> 02:42:24,113
[SPEAKER_32]: The larger administrative team meets monthly, and so this is also going to be presented to them at this state tomorrow, and we know that we will also be prepared to start meeting with the subcommittee as we continue to

1713
02:42:26,039 --> 02:42:29,942
[SPEAKER_32]: flesh this out and continue to build the glossary of terms.

1714
02:42:30,882 --> 02:42:36,606
[SPEAKER_32]: This was really an opportunity because there was a lot of questions about what was the strategic plan.

1715
02:42:36,686 --> 02:42:37,827
[SPEAKER_32]: What were we working on.

1716
02:42:39,588 --> 02:42:41,309
[SPEAKER_32]: What does it represent.

1717
02:42:41,429 --> 02:42:46,652
[SPEAKER_32]: And I really wanted the opportunity to present it to this entire body for you to see.

1718
02:42:47,401 --> 02:42:53,324
[SPEAKER_32]: that this is a combination of a year's work and where we are right now.

1719
02:42:53,604 --> 02:43:04,468
[SPEAKER_32]: So I would see us having a little bit more additional administrator input on some of the initiatives, knowing that it's not complete, that it will be a fluid document.

1720
02:43:04,608 --> 02:43:06,249
[SPEAKER_32]: It's a multi-year document.

1721
02:43:06,769 --> 02:43:08,070
[SPEAKER_32]: It's very ambitious.

1722
02:43:08,950 --> 02:43:12,532
[SPEAKER_32]: There are some things that will be able to happen immediately, like our

1723
02:43:13,512 --> 02:43:23,776
[SPEAKER_32]: website that was able to just be launched but it's that too is still going to be tweaked and there are other things that we have to schedule further out.

1724
02:43:24,136 --> 02:43:35,200
[SPEAKER_32]: So it will be fluid but it will be a kind of roadmap to guide the work that we are doing and will aspire to do in the future.

1725
02:43:36,201 --> 02:43:36,481
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1726
02:43:38,367 --> 02:44:00,597
[SPEAKER_04]: So to answer your question to regarding the action items which are filled or not I think what what I wanted to state was when we started this we were looking at things that we previously had And so it's sort of been a build from what we've previously had things that we had done when dr. Vincent had come in to the district, so this has been a long

1727
02:44:01,457 --> 02:44:16,289
[SPEAKER_04]: going process, and there's a lot of initiatives that Medford had down, but I don't think we were as organized as we probably could be, and this is really kind of honing down into directly what needs to be addressed and giving us timelines.

1728
02:44:16,829 --> 02:44:17,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

1729
02:44:17,950 --> 02:44:27,298
[SPEAKER_04]: It's given us timelines and things like that, so we're making sure that it's not just a document that's been said, it's something that we're following and we're updating every year if we need to.

1730
02:44:27,904 --> 02:44:29,285
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just wanted to kind of throw that.

1731
02:44:29,325 --> 02:44:31,646
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a grander picture all the way through.

1732
02:44:32,427 --> 02:44:41,813
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing, too, that's really important as the team, as we've been working together, is the thing we've realized is there are a tremendous amount of things that need to be done.

1733
02:44:42,553 --> 02:44:47,557
[SPEAKER_03]: And the question is, what is the capacity to actually carry these things out in a very good fashion?

1734
02:44:48,077 --> 02:44:51,799
[SPEAKER_03]: And so while it's 2020 to 2023, we're looking at things in almost an 18-month block.

1735
02:44:58,112 --> 02:45:00,274
[SPEAKER_03]: and then 18 months out to that three years.

1736
02:45:00,354 --> 02:45:16,911
[SPEAKER_03]: And like how do we actually build the timelines and the action items so that we don't create an impossible task, but we create things that can be achieved, can be done very well, and can show marked results to student improvement.

1737
02:45:18,135 --> 02:45:28,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything in here is about improving the student experience and making sure that student outcomes are what we see improved.

1738
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:34,041
[SPEAKER_03]: And for lack of saying in a lot of words, for all students.

1739
02:45:34,701 --> 02:45:44,365
[SPEAKER_03]: That we ensure that all students, regardless of who they are, regardless of their ability level, regardless of anything, that this plan speaks to them.

1740
02:45:45,496 --> 02:45:53,242
[SPEAKER_03]: speaks to their caregivers and speaks to our ability as a district to have the capacity to achieve greatness for them.

1741
02:45:55,303 --> 02:45:55,723
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

1742
02:45:56,464 --> 02:46:01,587
[SPEAKER_27]: We have our student rep, Mr. Mark Allen Jean Mary, who would like to

1743
02:46:03,126 --> 02:46:04,447
[SPEAKER_27]: Ask a question, go ahead.

1744
02:46:04,547 --> 02:46:20,273
[SPEAKER_30]: Okay, so I was looking at the mission statement and a part that really caught my attention was the focus on academic and personal potential, but I was looking at it more on the family basis and what that would mean for a family that might not have English as their first language.

1745
02:46:20,693 --> 02:46:26,555
[SPEAKER_30]: Personally, as an interpreter, I go and usually interpret for families that might not have English as their first language.

1746
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:46,008
[SPEAKER_30]: And I feel like what would be the improvements that are being made to have a sort of point person for these families to refer to, because as committee member Vendacrew was saying, it's important to get the support early on, to make sure that they feel that they have the support early on.

1747
02:46:46,628 --> 02:46:49,029
[SPEAKER_30]: And as Paolo was saying,

1748
02:46:49,970 --> 02:47:06,383
[SPEAKER_30]: that decision can affect the children, because the parents make the decision based on the first children, that could also affect what that would look like for the second, third, fourth, and that might make them change decision as to putting the kids in the Medford public school system.

1749
02:47:06,744 --> 02:47:12,409
[SPEAKER_30]: So I think it's really important to look at that aspect of how do we support them better earlier on.

1750
02:47:13,309 --> 02:47:13,950
[SPEAKER_30]: Great question.

1751
02:47:15,947 --> 02:47:16,207
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know.

1752
02:47:17,087 --> 02:47:18,408
[SPEAKER_27]: Does anybody have the answer to that?

1753
02:47:19,868 --> 02:47:29,930
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an action item that, I mean, as you know in the document, I know it seems general in the front, Mark, but what we try to do is we try to isolate those things in our action items.

1754
02:47:30,030 --> 02:47:36,412
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the second sheet that Dr. Cushing showed you, there's going to be a link for support on that end of it as well.

1755
02:47:37,321 --> 02:47:48,669
[SPEAKER_27]: And it probably would be, from the chair, it probably would be a lot in the communication aspect, how we give out communication, ensuring that it's in different languages, like Dr. Vincent had mentioned.

1756
02:47:48,709 --> 02:47:53,173
[SPEAKER_27]: So I'm sure you're working on that, absolutely.

1757
02:47:53,193 --> 02:47:54,353
[SPEAKER_27]: Great question, thank you.

1758
02:47:54,534 --> 02:47:54,834
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1759
02:47:55,254 --> 02:47:58,697
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, so if I can just try to answer your question.

1760
02:47:59,157 --> 02:48:04,381
[SPEAKER_16]: So as we mentioned, we have hyperlink strategic

1761
02:48:05,342 --> 02:48:07,143
[SPEAKER_16]: a strategic plan for each one of these.

1762
02:48:07,183 --> 02:48:29,413
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you look under fostering equitable learning environments, and you look at the initiatives, if you go down to one, two, the third bullet, I believe this is where, this is where we're, I'm not sure if this one was finished, I know we have the discussion, but promote and enhance activities and resources that address the needs of the whole child.

1763
02:48:29,933 --> 02:48:31,914
[SPEAKER_16]: So the resources, so a resource

1764
02:48:32,654 --> 02:48:39,817
[SPEAKER_16]: would be the translation, anything that would help a student access the curriculum.

1765
02:48:40,298 --> 02:48:45,960
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think what's important to note is that we wordsmithed each one of these over and over and over.

1766
02:48:46,020 --> 02:48:47,301
[SPEAKER_16]: We met many hours.

1767
02:48:48,021 --> 02:48:59,590
[SPEAKER_16]: Each word here may look on the face of it like, you know, oh, it's, you know, resource or, you know, but I do want to tell you that each word in here really is loaded with a specific meaning.

1768
02:49:00,050 --> 02:49:05,654
[SPEAKER_16]: So when you brought up that question, the first thing that jumped to me was that equitable learning environment.

1769
02:49:05,975 --> 02:49:14,461
[SPEAKER_16]: So that would be a resource that the district would want to provide to its students, its families to make it accessible to them.

1770
02:49:16,411 --> 02:49:28,678
[SPEAKER_27]: And Dr. Cadelli, too, under fostering collaborative relationships, engage in timely, thoughtful, two-way, culturally proficient communication with the Medford Mustang community.

1771
02:49:28,738 --> 02:49:33,461
[SPEAKER_27]: So I bet there will be a number of links that relate to.

1772
02:49:33,501 --> 02:49:34,261
[SPEAKER_16]: You're absolutely correct.

1773
02:49:34,281 --> 02:49:39,804
[SPEAKER_16]: There are a number of places where there's some duality, where there's some crossover.

1774
02:49:39,864 --> 02:49:41,245
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm glad you pointed that out.

1775
02:49:45,718 --> 02:49:48,059
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

1776
02:49:48,139 --> 02:49:48,259
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1777
02:49:48,499 --> 02:49:49,439
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Graham.

1778
02:49:49,479 --> 02:49:59,163
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you guys for all of your work so far.

1779
02:49:59,663 --> 02:50:04,345
[SPEAKER_19]: I am really excited that we are pursuing a strategic planning effort as a district.

1780
02:50:04,845 --> 02:50:10,867
[SPEAKER_19]: I feel like we've heard about a lot of strategic plans or the need for strategic plans in Medford over the last few months.

1781
02:50:11,448 --> 02:50:18,970
[SPEAKER_19]: And I really do believe that it's because we are sort of at this proverbial tipping point where we all recognize that we cannot continue without a strategic plan.

1782
02:50:20,331 --> 02:50:28,393
[SPEAKER_19]: Our strategic plan is an important roadmap and not something we can or should expect to come together quickly or easily, as you guys know because you've been at this for quite some time.

1783
02:50:30,034 --> 02:50:34,135
[SPEAKER_19]: But with our strategic plan process, we have an opportunity to listen to our many constituents

1784
02:50:34,673 --> 02:50:38,878
[SPEAKER_19]: and revisit things we've long accepted, including things like simply our mission statement.

1785
02:50:39,599 --> 02:50:46,968
[SPEAKER_19]: Our strategic plan, when it is completed, is also an overarching communication to the community about who we are, where we are going, and when we will get there.

1786
02:50:47,890 --> 02:50:51,214
[SPEAKER_19]: It allows us to be open and transparent about what we plan to do and when.

1787
02:50:52,113 --> 02:50:59,218
[SPEAKER_19]: It also sets the foundation for us all when the community asks, have we ever thought about X, or what does Medford do about Y?

1788
02:50:59,939 --> 02:51:05,543
[SPEAKER_19]: It will allow us to say, yes, we have thought about X, and we're going to complete that in year 20, fill in the blank.

1789
02:51:06,064 --> 02:51:11,308
[SPEAKER_19]: Because before we can get there, we have to do A, B, and C for that to be meaningful.

1790
02:51:12,509 --> 02:51:21,936
[SPEAKER_19]: Perhaps most importantly, it provides guidance to our spending choices so that we can spend wisely, and we can have real dialogue about the resources we need to execute the plans,

1791
02:51:22,532 --> 02:51:25,072
[SPEAKER_19]: accelerate certain parts, or add new ideas to it.

1792
02:51:25,793 --> 02:51:35,654
[SPEAKER_19]: So I want to thank you guys for all of this work, and I'm super excited that I get to be the chair of the communications, community engagement, and strategic planning subcommittee as we embark on this effort.

1793
02:51:36,554 --> 02:51:51,877
[SPEAKER_19]: I would like to make a motion to move this draft strategic plan to that committee so that we can start that process of that more in-depth look and work on our discussion around strategic planning and the entire process moving forward.

1794
02:51:52,577 --> 02:51:53,037
[SPEAKER_27]: Sounds great.

1795
02:51:54,859 --> 02:51:57,200
[SPEAKER_27]: Seconded by Member McLaughlin.

1796
02:51:57,541 --> 02:51:58,481
[SPEAKER_27]: All those in favor?

1797
02:51:58,501 --> 02:51:59,082
[SPEAKER_27]: Aye.

1798
02:51:59,162 --> 02:52:00,023
[SPEAKER_27]: All those opposed?

1799
02:52:00,043 --> 02:52:02,424
[SPEAKER_27]: We've got a busy committee, Ms.

1800
02:52:02,464 --> 02:52:02,825
[SPEAKER_27]: Graham.

1801
02:52:04,066 --> 02:52:06,868
[SPEAKER_27]: Closed for business after this meeting.

1802
02:52:07,828 --> 02:52:08,829
[SPEAKER_27]: Tap out, yeah.

1803
02:52:10,590 --> 02:52:11,491
[SPEAKER_27]: Member McLaughlin.

1804
02:52:12,572 --> 02:52:14,573
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you all very much for this.

1805
02:52:14,653 --> 02:52:16,615
[SPEAKER_24]: I can see that there's a lot of hard work put into it.

1806
02:52:17,536 --> 02:52:19,297
[SPEAKER_24]: I love the edgespeak, right?

1807
02:52:19,317 --> 02:52:21,839
[SPEAKER_24]: We've had lots of conversations about that over time.

1808
02:52:23,947 --> 02:52:25,928
[SPEAKER_24]: Send it to all the grad schools around town, please.

1809
02:52:26,148 --> 02:52:26,288
[SPEAKER_24]: No.

1810
02:52:27,548 --> 02:52:37,353
[SPEAKER_24]: But no, the edgespeak is really important, especially when families are having conversations and the acronyms roll off our tongues like we don't even notice anymore.

1811
02:52:37,553 --> 02:52:43,856
[SPEAKER_24]: And it's really important for people to be able to stop and remind us that we can tell them what those acronyms mean.

1812
02:52:43,876 --> 02:52:45,437
[SPEAKER_24]: So thank you for including that.

1813
02:52:45,537 --> 02:52:47,618
[SPEAKER_24]: I think the hyperlinks are really great.

1814
02:52:47,658 --> 02:52:48,298
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm glad to see it.

1815
02:52:48,318 --> 02:52:50,139
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm excited that I'm also on the subcommittee.

1816
02:52:50,598 --> 02:52:52,641
[SPEAKER_24]: So I'll be excited to be working with folks.

1817
02:52:52,681 --> 02:52:53,662
[SPEAKER_24]: I did have a couple of questions.

1818
02:52:53,702 --> 02:53:01,132
[SPEAKER_24]: I wanted to ask how you guys were chosen as district administrators to work on this particular strategic plan.

1819
02:53:02,419 --> 02:53:07,683
[SPEAKER_24]: Was it, did you self-select, did they volunteer, self-select, were you chosen, like how did that work?

1820
02:53:07,803 --> 02:53:08,283
[SPEAKER_24]: What was that process?

1821
02:53:08,303 --> 02:53:25,676
[SPEAKER_03]: So earlier this year in September, we really started to look at the best ways in using strategy and action and other resources, the best way to really move a strategic plan forward, because when you have a lot of voices,

1822
02:53:26,477 --> 02:53:32,222
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of times the actual work becomes substantially more difficult to initially get off the ground.

1823
02:53:32,782 --> 02:53:34,484
[SPEAKER_24]: Especially when you're wordsmithing everything.

1824
02:53:34,764 --> 02:53:36,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and I'll tell you, there was a...

1825
02:53:37,560 --> 02:53:41,403
[SPEAKER_03]: As my brother, the attorney, once said, there's a reason why people argue over the meaning of the word the.

1826
02:53:42,564 --> 02:53:43,565
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll be honest.

1827
02:53:44,306 --> 02:53:56,195
[SPEAKER_03]: We asked for people to self-select, people that were going to be able to dedicate two and three hours at a time, out of their day, in the afternoon, whenever it may be, to really dedicate themselves to this work.

1828
02:53:56,516 --> 02:53:59,378
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the group who stepped forward.

1829
02:54:00,639 --> 02:54:06,164
[SPEAKER_03]: It was open to anyone to reach out, to come to us.

1830
02:54:07,345 --> 02:54:27,782
[SPEAKER_03]: We did a Google form asking for people, trying to find the best availability, and then we just really had to hunker down and look at the documents, look at the data, and to really look at the things that came before this and to be able to work together as a team to craft this.

1831
02:54:28,383 --> 02:54:34,488
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's been a really amazing journey thus far, especially for someone who just came on board.

1832
02:54:35,538 --> 02:54:35,918
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

1833
02:54:36,138 --> 02:54:38,940
[SPEAKER_27]: We have a resident parent who would like to speak.

1834
02:54:39,680 --> 02:54:40,920
[SPEAKER_27]: Just name and address for the record.

1835
02:54:41,801 --> 02:54:43,522
[SPEAKER_11]: Sharon Hayes, 69 Ripley Road.

1836
02:54:44,182 --> 02:54:47,203
[SPEAKER_11]: I had a question about one specific thing that was mentioned.

1837
02:54:49,264 --> 02:54:55,687
[SPEAKER_11]: The replacement for the response to intervention, that was really a huge rollout, I remember.

1838
02:54:55,707 --> 02:54:57,868
[SPEAKER_11]: At least, was it last year or the year before?

1839
02:54:57,888 --> 02:55:04,811
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know I was specifically very interested in it because as an educator myself, I've been involved in response and intervention

1840
02:55:05,379 --> 02:55:19,786
[SPEAKER_11]: in other cities and towns and it's a really good process for identifying students who need extra support and then making sure you follow up in a set amount of time to see if they need to go further, if they need more support, if they need to be tested for special education.

1841
02:55:20,206 --> 02:55:25,609
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm a little concerned to hear that that's being dropped or being morphed into something else.

1842
02:55:26,175 --> 02:55:30,077
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I guess I'm wondering, is there going to be a description of what that is?

1843
02:55:30,157 --> 02:55:32,078
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I've never heard of this new one.

1844
02:55:32,098 --> 02:55:34,499
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if it's specific to Medford or not.

1845
02:55:34,539 --> 02:55:36,480
[SPEAKER_11]: But like I said, I know the response to intervention.

1846
02:55:36,540 --> 02:55:37,541
[SPEAKER_11]: I know it works well.

1847
02:55:37,621 --> 02:55:40,702
[SPEAKER_11]: So personally, I'm a little concerned to hear it's being changed.

1848
02:55:40,922 --> 02:55:41,623
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1849
02:55:41,663 --> 02:55:43,483
[SPEAKER_15]: So MTSSE is like an umbrella?

1850
02:55:49,306 --> 02:55:52,268
[SPEAKER_15]: And so RTI fits underneath.

1851
02:55:52,348 --> 02:56:00,231
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're not dropping RTI, but RTI is more academic based, and it focuses on what students need academically.

1852
02:56:00,771 --> 02:56:08,795
[SPEAKER_15]: We want to think about the whole child, and we also want to have systems in place to address the social, emotional, or physical needs.

1853
02:56:09,614 --> 02:56:11,996
[SPEAKER_15]: So in addition to RTI.

1854
02:56:12,016 --> 02:56:16,319
[SPEAKER_04]: So MTSS is also on the DESE website and it gives a nice description of

1855
02:56:39,438 --> 02:56:42,460
[SPEAKER_21]: how the process works, it's tiered intervention.

1856
02:56:42,920 --> 02:56:47,863
[SPEAKER_21]: So tier one would be what happens in gen ed for all students.

1857
02:56:48,323 --> 02:57:07,055
[SPEAKER_21]: And then as students need more support through screening or through classroom observation, they're given more supports, and you kind of watch them and progress monitor to see how they're doing, and then if they need more intervention on top of that, you continue to provide it until you give them the amount of intervention they need to be successful.

1858
02:57:07,793 --> 02:57:12,035
[SPEAKER_21]: You're not just looking at academics, which was really where RTI started.

1859
02:57:12,595 --> 02:57:14,837
[SPEAKER_21]: But RTI is still alive and well.

1860
02:57:15,237 --> 02:57:17,198
[SPEAKER_21]: It's just an aspect of MTSS.

1861
02:57:17,718 --> 02:57:24,802
[SPEAKER_21]: Now what makes MTSS-E special is that we've decided to go one step further and to really think about enrichment.

1862
02:57:24,922 --> 02:57:30,204
[SPEAKER_21]: Because there are students who might be having their needs met in Gen Ed, but maybe they need more.

1863
02:57:30,384 --> 02:57:31,425
[SPEAKER_21]: Maybe they can do more.

1864
02:57:31,485 --> 02:57:32,786
[SPEAKER_21]: Maybe we can push them further.

1865
02:57:33,206 --> 02:57:35,567
[SPEAKER_21]: So we're looking at enrichment as well.

1866
02:57:36,207 --> 02:57:37,408
[SPEAKER_21]: Does that help answer your question?

1867
02:57:38,834 --> 02:57:39,275
[SPEAKER_21]: It does.

1868
02:57:40,375 --> 02:57:41,896
[SPEAKER_11]: Sharon, you can come on up.

1869
02:57:43,076 --> 02:57:47,038
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is probably more, maybe it's going to be discussed at another meeting in more depth.

1870
02:57:47,439 --> 02:58:03,006
[SPEAKER_11]: I just know that there were a lot of questions and issues with how to even implement the RTI piece of it, in terms of having staffing to do all of the pieces of it, in terms of going into the classrooms, doing observations, and then providing whatever supports were needed.

1871
02:58:04,321 --> 02:58:21,914
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, I'm just curious now that it's going to be even a broader process or include more types of interventions or more types of needs, how that's going to be implemented, given that my understanding was RTI has not even been completely implemented yet, the academic piece of it.

1872
02:58:22,014 --> 02:58:23,856
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's...

1873
02:58:24,505 --> 02:58:25,165
[SPEAKER_11]: Kind of what I'm wondering.

1874
02:58:25,225 --> 02:58:27,886
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if there's going to be another meeting to talk about it in more depth.

1875
02:58:29,907 --> 02:58:31,707
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1876
02:58:32,167 --> 02:58:38,409
[SPEAKER_21]: You will see more of the answers to your questions in the action plans that are linked to the initiatives.

1877
02:58:38,649 --> 02:58:41,470
[SPEAKER_21]: So it will be laid out in a way that you can see how do we get there.

1878
02:58:41,850 --> 02:58:43,090
[SPEAKER_21]: Because we've been having those discussions.

1879
02:58:43,110 --> 02:58:43,350
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1880
02:58:46,651 --> 02:58:46,952
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

1881
02:58:47,112 --> 02:58:47,772
[SPEAKER_27]: Member McLaughlin?

1882
02:58:48,632 --> 02:58:51,413
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, I just had a small point of,

1883
02:58:52,762 --> 02:58:58,865
[SPEAKER_24]: I guess a question, and I'm sure you guys, some of you guys have thought about this, but I'm wondering how you're going to address it or how you want the community to address.

1884
02:58:59,485 --> 02:59:07,828
[SPEAKER_24]: So the acronym's great for the strategic plan, but as you know, especially Stacey, that that has a whole other meaning in childhood trauma.

1885
02:59:08,829 --> 02:59:12,910
[SPEAKER_24]: And so how do we, how, you know, I think about the differentiation of that.

1886
02:59:12,950 --> 02:59:21,734
[SPEAKER_24]: So ACES is also the Adverse Childhood Experience Study, which is a very large study on childhood trauma and the effects of childhood trauma on, you know, children's

1887
02:59:22,441 --> 02:59:25,062
[SPEAKER_24]: long-term effects on their lives and so on and so forth.

1888
02:59:25,102 --> 02:59:27,342
[SPEAKER_24]: So did that come up in your conversations at all?

1889
02:59:27,722 --> 02:59:28,002
[SPEAKER_20]: Sure.

1890
02:59:28,122 --> 02:59:35,944
[SPEAKER_20]: And that would be addressed under, um, the latter part, which is increased support and understanding for the social emotional needs of Medford students.

1891
02:59:37,064 --> 02:59:37,324
[SPEAKER_20]: Right.

1892
02:59:38,404 --> 02:59:42,125
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, the acronym had been brought in by Dr. Edouard-Vincent.

1893
02:59:42,725 --> 02:59:45,286
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, and this was an enhancement of that with support.

1894
02:59:46,689 --> 02:59:54,634
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that, you know, spelling it out at the end will hopefully, and as well as in the logo itself, will help people sort of differentiate that.

1895
02:59:57,436 --> 03:00:04,181
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, did you touch the mic now?

1896
03:00:06,923 --> 03:00:07,323
[SPEAKER_27]: You're on now.

1897
03:00:21,987 --> 03:00:24,929
[SPEAKER_20]: Certainly, and perhaps that's something we should add to our glossary of terms.

1898
03:00:24,949 --> 03:00:26,311
[SPEAKER_20]: Just to sort of clarify that.

1899
03:00:26,971 --> 03:00:27,371
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1900
03:00:32,936 --> 03:00:33,456
[SPEAKER_19]: Member Graham.

1901
03:00:34,477 --> 03:00:37,800
[SPEAKER_19]: So having heard Sharon's question and Melanie's question,

1902
03:00:38,700 --> 03:00:45,865
[SPEAKER_19]: I feel like the answer to both of these questions is that we have to be both patient and impatient at exactly the same time.

1903
03:00:47,066 --> 03:00:50,988
[SPEAKER_19]: None of these things can happen by June, July.

1904
03:00:52,329 --> 03:01:05,838
[SPEAKER_19]: Small things can happen, but we're talking about moving a massive organization in a totally specific direction, and that takes a tremendous amount of time.

1905
03:01:07,068 --> 03:01:21,195
[SPEAKER_19]: In the best of situations, resources are not an issue and you can just commit to moving in that direction, but we have sort of added complication that we do not have endless resources to execute on every single thing that we want.

1906
03:01:21,255 --> 03:01:27,558
[SPEAKER_19]: So sort of patience and impatience is an interesting balance to have to strike when you do strategic planning.

1907
03:01:28,159 --> 03:01:32,601
[SPEAKER_19]: I think the other thing that happens often when you do strategic planning in any capacity is

1908
03:01:33,410 --> 03:01:37,751
[SPEAKER_19]: What you thought was done is often really just the beginning.

1909
03:01:38,291 --> 03:01:47,553
[SPEAKER_19]: So something like an acronym, when you start talking to other people, you may find that that acronym really just doesn't speak to people.

1910
03:01:47,773 --> 03:01:56,595
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think I want us all to be open to the fact that this is the beginning of a process that is going to take some time and be

1911
03:01:58,337 --> 03:02:19,421
[SPEAKER_27]: Willingness to say we're not going to leave any stone unturned and that may mean that we turn the stone over like four or five times before we land Thank you Motion we already took the motion to send it to subcommittees So thank you all for being here and for your presentation.

1912
03:02:19,461 --> 03:02:20,001
[SPEAKER_27]: It was great.

1913
03:02:20,021 --> 03:02:20,281
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

1914
03:02:20,521 --> 03:02:25,422
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you to our superintendent for leading the effort Do we have any old business?

1915
03:02:28,103 --> 03:02:28,623
[SPEAKER_27]: We did vote.

1916
03:02:30,424 --> 03:02:31,665
[SPEAKER_11]: We did.

1917
03:02:35,087 --> 03:02:37,308
[SPEAKER_27]: No, we're going to get through this, OK?

1918
03:02:37,548 --> 03:02:42,351
[SPEAKER_27]: If there's no old business, is there any communications?

1919
03:02:48,114 --> 03:02:48,975
[SPEAKER_24]: Member McLaughlin.

1920
03:02:51,650 --> 03:02:54,271
[SPEAKER_24]: Regarding communications, a few things.

1921
03:02:54,411 --> 03:03:10,659
[SPEAKER_24]: One was I wanted to make a motion for school committee member updates as part of our weekly or bi-monthly meetings so that the community and each other can know what each school committee member is working on.

1922
03:03:10,719 --> 03:03:15,522
[SPEAKER_24]: So I'm making a motion under the communications to have school committee member updates.

1923
03:03:18,507 --> 03:03:21,268
[SPEAKER_27]: A motion by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Mustone.

1924
03:03:21,288 --> 03:03:22,048
[SPEAKER_27]: All those in favor?

1925
03:03:23,208 --> 03:03:24,008
[SPEAKER_27]: Paper passes.

1926
03:03:24,028 --> 03:03:27,489
[SPEAKER_24]: I have another motion under communication.

1927
03:03:27,829 --> 03:03:30,230
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1928
03:03:30,250 --> 03:03:36,452
[SPEAKER_24]: I've been coming to meetings for years in the audience and I appreciate those of you that are still out there.

1929
03:03:36,632 --> 03:03:37,052
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1930
03:03:37,512 --> 03:03:40,953
[SPEAKER_24]: I know how tiring it can be sitting out there and watching all night.

1931
03:03:41,892 --> 03:03:50,683
[SPEAKER_24]: But there's been a lot of conversation over years about providing materials that are in our packets to the public whenever possible.

1932
03:03:50,783 --> 03:03:54,128
[SPEAKER_24]: So obviously we wouldn't be providing materials that are confidential.

1933
03:03:54,168 --> 03:03:57,272
[SPEAKER_24]: But there's a lot of material here that's very useful.

1934
03:03:57,988 --> 03:04:04,094
[SPEAKER_24]: I also wanted to ask if we could get a copy of the PowerPoint from tonight, just because it's helpful for referencing in the past.

1935
03:04:04,134 --> 03:04:16,006
[SPEAKER_24]: But I'd like to make a motion that we are able to create weekly school committee packets for the community that are online and available, so that the community can access what we're talking about.

1936
03:04:16,086 --> 03:04:20,591
[SPEAKER_24]: Because having sat on the other side of that railing, I know that you're getting

1937
03:04:20,956 --> 03:04:31,701
[SPEAKER_24]: bits and pieces of the information, but it's really helpful to have things in front of you or to be able to look at it in advance so that if you have any questions in the future and so I'm making a motion to put that material online.

1938
03:04:31,821 --> 03:04:44,766
[SPEAKER_27]: From the chair, I believe we did discuss this one of our first get togethers, so hopefully minutes, agendas and commit reports be posted on the website.

1939
03:04:44,807 --> 03:04:49,469
[SPEAKER_27]: But let's take another motion by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Mustone.

1940
03:04:49,509 --> 03:04:50,329
[SPEAKER_27]: All those in favor?

1941
03:04:51,298 --> 03:04:52,720
[SPEAKER_27]: All those opposed, paper passes.

1942
03:04:53,060 --> 03:04:53,420
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

1943
03:04:55,542 --> 03:05:06,293
[SPEAKER_32]: I do have a concern in terms of the demand and the time frame because some of the reports are

1944
03:05:07,580 --> 03:05:14,606
[SPEAKER_32]: are being generated in almost real time to get the packets to you on Friday.

1945
03:05:14,626 --> 03:05:28,998
[SPEAKER_32]: And because things are being added, and I know it's something that may end up going to the Rules Subcommittee, but there will definitely need to be like a clear cutoff time in order to get it done because the same exact

1946
03:05:29,685 --> 03:05:39,433
[SPEAKER_32]: administrators that you see who are still here this evening, they actually have other jobs and responsibilities where they're in the field servicing students.

1947
03:05:40,133 --> 03:05:47,559
[SPEAKER_32]: And the amount of time that some of the reports take requires them to stop doing the other work in order to do that.

1948
03:05:48,020 --> 03:05:49,641
[SPEAKER_32]: So I just want to be

1949
03:05:51,880 --> 03:06:21,122
[SPEAKER_32]: realistic in saying that we're going to get them printed in color and ready to be delivered to you, the entire school committee, by Friday evening, and to have it select portions of the reports online that there will need to probably be some kind of timeline that's generated in order for that to realistically be done.

1950
03:06:22,468 --> 03:06:25,571
[SPEAKER_32]: I just want to state that honestly.

1951
03:06:27,632 --> 03:06:27,912
[SPEAKER_24]: Sure.

1952
03:06:27,932 --> 03:06:29,994
[SPEAKER_24]: I think that it's reasonable.

1953
03:06:30,074 --> 03:06:34,037
[SPEAKER_24]: I assume that the reports are being provided electronically, right?

1954
03:06:34,698 --> 03:06:35,458
[SPEAKER_24]: So not printed.

1955
03:06:35,558 --> 03:06:49,269
[SPEAKER_24]: So that, I mean, I'm just imagining that if there's a, and again, I'm not sure of processes, but if there's a, an electronic report that's going to administration, then once the report is reviewed, obviously by, by central administration, what have you, then it,

1956
03:06:49,969 --> 03:06:59,993
[SPEAKER_24]: It also gets forwarded to the webmaster or whoever to put together these packets that can be available by Monday or whenever so that people have it before the meeting.

1957
03:07:00,013 --> 03:07:06,395
[SPEAKER_24]: I wouldn't expect simultaneously, but I'm assuming the reports are all sent electronically anyway, so it's sort of just another step in procedure.

1958
03:07:06,455 --> 03:07:15,478
[SPEAKER_24]: And maybe it goes to the policy subcommittee just to figure out what the actual procedure is, what that looks like.

1959
03:07:16,018 --> 03:07:17,959
[SPEAKER_24]: And I'm happy to refer it to that just in terms of

1960
03:07:19,392 --> 03:07:23,394
[SPEAKER_24]: how we want to step it so that you have a timeline that's reasonable.

1961
03:07:23,414 --> 03:07:26,675
[SPEAKER_24]: Because we definitely aren't interested in giving people more work.

1962
03:07:26,795 --> 03:07:28,256
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm not interested in giving people more work.

1963
03:07:28,296 --> 03:07:29,776
[SPEAKER_24]: I really just want to share information.

1964
03:07:29,816 --> 03:07:30,057
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

1965
03:07:31,237 --> 03:07:31,537
[SPEAKER_24]: OK.

1966
03:07:32,017 --> 03:07:32,397
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1967
03:07:32,417 --> 03:07:35,259
[SPEAKER_27]: Through the chair, could it be uploaded on Monday by our webmaster?

1968
03:07:35,319 --> 03:07:36,919
[SPEAKER_32]: I think Monday would be reasonable.

1969
03:07:37,079 --> 03:07:37,320
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes.

1970
03:07:38,720 --> 03:07:39,320
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Mustone.

1971
03:07:39,400 --> 03:07:40,501
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what I was going to suggest.

1972
03:07:40,561 --> 03:07:42,822
[SPEAKER_17]: Because I know you're at the wire on Friday night.

1973
03:07:42,962 --> 03:07:47,504
[SPEAKER_17]: But I think even if they're uploaded by 5 o'clock on Monday, people can check it out.

1974
03:07:48,684 --> 03:07:50,345
[SPEAKER_17]: have it with them when they're on their phone here.

1975
03:07:52,227 --> 03:07:54,609
[SPEAKER_27]: Or even follow along from the audience, absolutely.

1976
03:07:54,629 --> 03:07:57,831
[SPEAKER_27]: Great.

1977
03:07:57,971 --> 03:07:58,892
[SPEAKER_27]: Any new business?

1978
03:08:01,173 --> 03:08:01,634
[SPEAKER_27]: Here we go.

1979
03:08:04,476 --> 03:08:06,337
[SPEAKER_27]: Reorganization of our subcommittees.

1980
03:08:07,018 --> 03:08:07,818
[SPEAKER_27]: Motion to approve.

1981
03:08:07,878 --> 03:08:08,779
[SPEAKER_27]: All those in favor?

1982
03:08:08,799 --> 03:08:10,440
[SPEAKER_27]: All those opposed?

1983
03:08:11,781 --> 03:08:12,662
[SPEAKER_27]: Mayor Van der Kloot.

1984
03:08:14,135 --> 03:08:17,037
[SPEAKER_18]: I, now that we've officially.

1985
03:08:17,077 --> 03:08:17,678
[SPEAKER_18]: She loves that.

1986
03:08:17,718 --> 03:08:18,378
[SPEAKER_18]: You're promoted.

1987
03:08:18,398 --> 03:08:21,340
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm out of here.

1988
03:08:23,862 --> 03:08:24,923
[SPEAKER_19]: Wow, that was easy.

1989
03:08:25,664 --> 03:08:26,344
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry.

1990
03:08:26,424 --> 03:08:30,828
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, I didn't move my brain until 10 p.m.

1991
03:08:30,848 --> 03:08:33,690
[SPEAKER_18]: So, given that we are now official, I'd like to

1992
03:08:37,413 --> 03:08:44,660
[SPEAKER_18]: Announce that the curriculum subcommittee is going to meet on Wednesday at 6 o'clock between 6 and 7.

1993
03:08:45,801 --> 03:08:51,447
[SPEAKER_18]: We are meeting at the request of associate superintendent Diane Caldwell.

1994
03:08:51,920 --> 03:08:56,041
[SPEAKER_18]: for a presentation on enhanced core reading instruction.

1995
03:08:57,081 --> 03:09:07,964
[SPEAKER_18]: We did the unusual step of going ahead and setting up the meeting prior to sending it to the subcommittee officially from this body because of a timeline issue.

1996
03:09:08,024 --> 03:09:11,325
[SPEAKER_18]: So I hope that no one has any concern or objection.

1997
03:09:12,645 --> 03:09:18,327
[SPEAKER_18]: So that will be on this Wednesday, February 5th at 6 o'clock up at the high school.

1998
03:09:19,312 --> 03:09:19,672
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1999
03:09:20,052 --> 03:09:27,797
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, while we're under this, I noticed that we haven't yet received any appointees to the vision committee.

2000
03:09:27,877 --> 03:09:31,599
[SPEAKER_18]: And I just want to ask the mayor what her intention was about that.

2001
03:09:32,739 --> 03:09:37,742
[SPEAKER_27]: Superintendent gave me the package Thursday or Friday of last week.

2002
03:09:38,383 --> 03:09:40,924
[SPEAKER_27]: It is hopefully going to be done by the end of the week.

2003
03:09:41,224 --> 03:09:45,827
[SPEAKER_27]: There are 41 applicants, which is a lot of people.

2004
03:09:46,769 --> 03:09:49,511
[SPEAKER_27]: We're talking of a committee between 11 and 13.

2005
03:09:49,571 --> 03:09:52,994
[SPEAKER_27]: We just want to make sure it's done as fair as possible.

2006
03:09:53,575 --> 03:09:54,315
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you very much.

2007
03:09:54,415 --> 03:09:54,736
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2008
03:09:56,998 --> 03:09:57,698
[SPEAKER_27]: Member McLaughlin.

2009
03:10:03,476 --> 03:10:13,439
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Member van der Kloot, for the information on the enhanced reading this Wednesday for the curriculum subcommittee.

2010
03:10:15,120 --> 03:10:19,121
[SPEAKER_24]: And I'm assuming that that's this Wednesday this time.

2011
03:10:19,181 --> 03:10:21,942
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not Wednesdays all the time, or?

2012
03:10:21,962 --> 03:10:22,002
[SPEAKER_24]: OK.

2013
03:10:23,423 --> 03:10:24,323
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, just want to make sure.

2014
03:10:24,343 --> 03:10:26,684
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm thinking of CPAC and other things that are happening.

2015
03:10:29,975 --> 03:10:31,616
[SPEAKER_24]: No, not this week, second Wednesday.

2016
03:10:32,477 --> 03:10:32,918
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, thank you.

2017
03:10:33,418 --> 03:10:43,106
[SPEAKER_24]: And then the other is regarding the high school vision committee and the 41 applicants when you're talking about there's 11 to 13 and you want it to be as fair as possible.

2018
03:10:43,546 --> 03:10:49,391
[SPEAKER_24]: So to that end, are you thinking about, I'm wondering how that fairness is possible.

2019
03:10:49,451 --> 03:10:50,172
[SPEAKER_24]: Is it a lottery?

2020
03:10:50,272 --> 03:10:53,615
[SPEAKER_24]: Is it you're looking at different age levels?

2021
03:10:53,655 --> 03:10:55,656
[SPEAKER_24]: You're looking at different schools, grades, like how?

2022
03:10:57,939 --> 03:11:06,063
[SPEAKER_27]: one or two school committee members, one or two from the administration, maybe a parent from each level.

2023
03:11:06,163 --> 03:11:13,886
[SPEAKER_27]: I haven't done it fully in my head, but also there are a number of parents and also professionals in the industry.

2024
03:11:14,247 --> 03:11:17,408
[SPEAKER_27]: So I want to make sure I, one engineer, one architect.

2025
03:11:17,668 --> 03:11:21,290
[SPEAKER_27]: I haven't weeded through them all, but I just kind of look to see how many.

2026
03:11:22,050 --> 03:11:23,051
[SPEAKER_27]: But along those lines.

2027
03:11:23,071 --> 03:11:24,091
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

2028
03:11:24,111 --> 03:11:25,892
[SPEAKER_02]: I would just encourage the high needs

2029
03:11:37,531 --> 03:11:50,395
[SPEAKER_27]: Given the creation of ad hoc reports at the behest of the School Committee can require substantial effort on the part of the Office of the Superintendent and her staff, and that the School Committee often depends on these ad hoc reports to assist in deliberations,

2030
03:11:50,950 --> 03:11:58,432
[SPEAKER_27]: The Rules, Policy, and Equity Subcommittee shall generate a new rule for the School Committee to guide how ad hoc reports requests are generated.

2031
03:12:00,713 --> 03:12:06,774
[SPEAKER_27]: Motion for approval by Member Van der Kloot, seconded by Member Kreatz.

2032
03:12:06,894 --> 03:12:07,655
[SPEAKER_27]: All those in favor?

2033
03:12:08,135 --> 03:12:08,715
[SPEAKER_27]: All those opposed?

2034
03:12:12,301 --> 03:12:13,021
[SPEAKER_27]: Member McLaughlin.

2035
03:12:13,081 --> 03:12:13,301
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

2036
03:12:13,941 --> 03:12:15,622
[SPEAKER_24]: So, um, thank you.

2037
03:12:15,962 --> 03:12:16,722
[SPEAKER_24]: I just have a question.

2038
03:12:16,742 --> 03:12:30,045
[SPEAKER_24]: So if the rules and so, so what I'm understanding this is saying is that, um, the rules policy and equity subcommittee will make, will help devise policy on how reports are requested.

2039
03:12:30,466 --> 03:12:32,546
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, is that accurate?

2040
03:12:33,586 --> 03:12:34,147
[SPEAKER_27]: Member Ruseau.

2041
03:12:34,947 --> 03:12:35,747
[SPEAKER_34]: Um, we will,

2042
03:12:36,363 --> 03:12:48,330
[SPEAKER_34]: what you are on the subcommittee, but we will get together and we will draft a new rule, not a policy, that will tell all of us how we shall request ad hoc reports.

2043
03:12:48,550 --> 03:12:53,313
[SPEAKER_34]: Of course, once we have that recommendation, we bring it back here to vote on it, and you can all say that.

2044
03:12:54,574 --> 03:12:55,915
[SPEAKER_34]: Hopefully, you'll agree with that rule.

2045
03:12:56,955 --> 03:12:58,837
[SPEAKER_34]: And then that will be the rule.

2046
03:13:02,059 --> 03:13:04,260
[SPEAKER_34]: The intention of this is that nobody will be here saying,

2047
03:13:04,793 --> 03:13:07,214
[SPEAKER_34]: I'd like a report and just start rattling off what you want.

2048
03:13:08,615 --> 03:13:11,236
[SPEAKER_34]: And we can get in the subcommittee.

2049
03:13:11,256 --> 03:13:14,698
[SPEAKER_34]: We can go into the gory details of what's so horrible about that.

2050
03:13:15,839 --> 03:13:20,441
[SPEAKER_34]: Simple reports might actually require 40 hours of labor, just so you can ask a simple question.

2051
03:13:22,202 --> 03:13:23,003
[SPEAKER_34]: And that might be OK.

2052
03:13:24,571 --> 03:13:41,327
[SPEAKER_34]: I don't think when we approve those reports, we all realize what we're doing to the superintendent's office, and I might not be so willing to approve a report request if I thought, if knew, for instance, that answering your question requires an obscene amount of work.

2053
03:13:42,288 --> 03:13:47,093
[SPEAKER_34]: So that's sort of the whole genesis of this, because we have a long list of ad hoc reports.

2054
03:13:49,099 --> 03:13:54,903
[SPEAKER_34]: And no idea, because they haven't probably even been started, I'm assuming.

2055
03:13:54,983 --> 03:13:55,704
[SPEAKER_34]: But we don't know.

2056
03:13:56,084 --> 03:14:05,551
[SPEAKER_34]: Are these reports that are simple, and like somebody clicks a button in some software program, or are these reports that take weeks of staff's effort to answer questions?

2057
03:14:05,611 --> 03:14:09,113
[SPEAKER_34]: By the way, our reports right now, they don't even know what the question is they're trying to answer.

2058
03:14:09,654 --> 03:14:13,176
[SPEAKER_34]: So I mean, I think it's important we have a simple form.

2059
03:14:13,476 --> 03:14:14,197
[SPEAKER_34]: What do you want to know?

2060
03:14:14,884 --> 03:14:37,923
[SPEAKER_34]: why do you want to know it so we're not playing gotcha with the administration, digging up lots of data so we can try and find something somebody did wrong or something, and then get an estimate from the administration, what does it really take to do this report so that we can, I'm sort of just telling you what I want to do with this subcommittee, but that's the genesis of this, is that it's just too easy to rattle off a report

2061
03:14:38,550 --> 03:14:46,177
[SPEAKER_34]: and think that we have like 40 people sitting around in central administration running off to do our work for us, and that they don't exist, so.

2062
03:14:46,197 --> 03:14:47,898
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2063
03:14:48,118 --> 03:14:51,381
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm glad you're on the subcommittee, because... I'm glad I'm on it, too.

2064
03:14:52,322 --> 03:14:52,742
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2065
03:14:53,463 --> 03:14:54,684
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, that's good.

2066
03:14:55,365 --> 03:15:04,472
[SPEAKER_24]: So, but I'm assuming there'll be a process for whatever reports were requested, obviously, as well, that there's a timeline or whatever, because a lot of these are from... And again, since they're from 2019,

2067
03:15:07,034 --> 03:15:24,818
[SPEAKER_24]: at this point, it's come back to November of 2019, or April, or October, or whatever, 2019, that there'll be questions, like you said, there'll be some documentation of why these reports were requested, and that's reported out to the public about why the reports are being requested.

2068
03:15:25,598 --> 03:15:35,821
[SPEAKER_34]: And I think these existing reports, for the most part, especially the older ones, I don't think any of us are going to be able to answer those questions, and we can just vote to take them off the list.

2069
03:15:37,373 --> 03:15:41,094
[SPEAKER_34]: Or keep them on the list if we can imagine why the report is here.

2070
03:15:41,194 --> 03:15:47,575
[SPEAKER_34]: I mean, get a list of out-of-district student enrollment in Medford Public Schools, I'm guessing that is like how many?

2071
03:15:48,195 --> 03:15:50,436
[SPEAKER_34]: We aren't going to get a list of the actual students.

2072
03:15:50,876 --> 03:15:58,417
[SPEAKER_24]: No, I wouldn't imagine that you'd get the list of the actual students, but I think that is really interesting information just in terms of how many, how much, you know, other things.

2073
03:15:58,477 --> 03:16:02,158
[SPEAKER_24]: But so, okay, so there's going to be a process is sort of what I'm understanding.

2074
03:16:02,580 --> 03:16:03,442
[SPEAKER_24]: instead of just asking.

2075
03:16:03,542 --> 03:16:10,353
[SPEAKER_24]: So that's helpful and I assume that that process will include a timeline and reporting out to the public as the subcommittee would need to do.

2076
03:16:10,373 --> 03:16:11,275
[SPEAKER_24]: Is that right?

2077
03:16:11,355 --> 03:16:16,484
[SPEAKER_34]: This will just be to generate a rule that we will then follow as a committee if we approve the rule.

2078
03:16:18,308 --> 03:16:21,109
[SPEAKER_24]: and the subcommittee will report out that rule.

2079
03:16:21,129 --> 03:16:21,949
[SPEAKER_24]: The recommendation.

2080
03:16:21,989 --> 03:16:22,909
[SPEAKER_24]: To this recommendation.

2081
03:16:24,490 --> 03:16:28,551
[SPEAKER_27]: To this full committee where it can be changed or amended and then voted on.

2082
03:16:28,731 --> 03:16:29,511
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, thank you.

2083
03:16:29,892 --> 03:16:30,592
[SPEAKER_27]: You're welcome.

2084
03:16:30,612 --> 03:16:32,412
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, motion for approval by Ms.

2085
03:16:32,432 --> 03:16:34,833
[SPEAKER_27]: Vanjie Clute, seconded by Ms.

2086
03:16:34,893 --> 03:16:35,293
[SPEAKER_27]: Kreatz.

2087
03:16:35,513 --> 03:16:36,213
[SPEAKER_27]: All those in favor?

2088
03:16:36,233 --> 03:16:36,493
[SPEAKER_27]: Aye.

2089
03:16:36,654 --> 03:16:37,374
[SPEAKER_27]: All those opposed?

2090
03:16:37,434 --> 03:16:38,154
[SPEAKER_27]: Motion passes.

2091
03:16:39,594 --> 03:16:47,957
[SPEAKER_27]: Offered by Vice Chair Rousseau, given that several periodic reports are required by law, regulation, past practice, and best practice,

2092
03:16:48,541 --> 03:17:00,866
[SPEAKER_27]: The Rules, Policy, and Equity Subcommittee shall promulgate an annual schedule of such reports to provide the superintendent, the school committee, and the public a transparent and concise understanding of when to expect these reports.

2093
03:17:03,707 --> 03:17:09,109
[SPEAKER_27]: Motion for approval by Member Van der Kloot, seconded by Member Graham.

2094
03:17:09,269 --> 03:17:10,009
[SPEAKER_27]: All those in favor?

2095
03:17:10,410 --> 03:17:10,510
[SPEAKER_34]: Aye.

2096
03:17:10,690 --> 03:17:11,370
[SPEAKER_27]: Paper passes.

2097
03:17:13,283 --> 03:17:28,637
[SPEAKER_27]: offered by myself, be resolved, the administration provide the school committee with an update report on dyslexia during our 2-24 meeting and all the changes that have taken place since June to improve how we test and treat.

2098
03:17:28,657 --> 03:17:34,262
[SPEAKER_18]: May I ask a question?

2099
03:17:34,282 --> 03:17:34,362
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

2100
03:17:34,382 --> 03:17:40,267
[SPEAKER_18]: I just wanna make sure, this is one of those circumstances where we have a meeting immediately after a vacation week.

2101
03:17:41,902 --> 03:17:50,634
[SPEAKER_18]: And so given that timeline, is that meeting the best meeting to do that?

2102
03:17:51,135 --> 03:17:53,559
[SPEAKER_18]: Are you prepared at that point?

2103
03:17:54,597 --> 03:18:10,982
[SPEAKER_32]: This is a very lengthy process, so we've actually started gathering the data, so by the time we get to the 24th, we should be ready to make a presentation, but it's been ongoing.

2104
03:18:11,042 --> 03:18:13,743
[SPEAKER_32]: It's a very long process.

2105
03:18:14,163 --> 03:18:20,985
[SPEAKER_18]: I only raise it only because of the fact it is right after, and you know, some people are on vacation, but not all.

2106
03:18:21,645 --> 03:18:23,387
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, thank you, and I would support it.

2107
03:18:24,027 --> 03:18:25,248
[SPEAKER_18]: So motion for approval.

2108
03:18:25,949 --> 03:18:26,269
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2109
03:18:26,450 --> 03:18:29,953
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you, Madam Superintendent never McLaughlin.

2110
03:18:32,215 --> 03:18:32,815
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, second of the most.

2111
03:18:33,075 --> 03:18:38,000
[SPEAKER_24]: But also, yeah, so that I'm just asking here's a stick and I'm sorry, it's just.

2112
03:18:39,701 --> 03:18:42,444
[SPEAKER_24]: So this tell me when you tell me OK.

2113
03:18:45,446 --> 03:18:46,127
[SPEAKER_27]: Just not working.

2114
03:18:47,228 --> 03:18:47,888
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, there it goes.

2115
03:18:47,928 --> 03:18:48,589
[SPEAKER_24]: Yep, now I see it.

2116
03:18:49,517 --> 03:18:49,817
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2117
03:18:49,837 --> 03:18:51,378
[SPEAKER_24]: Go ahead.

2118
03:18:51,738 --> 03:19:03,385
[SPEAKER_24]: So this would be an example of in the future or something that would have to go through this, the policy, what, yeah, the rules, this request, right?

2119
03:19:05,506 --> 03:19:13,671
[SPEAKER_24]: That resolution that the mayor offered for the report on dyslexia, that would be one, again, that would not be offered in this format.

2120
03:19:13,731 --> 03:19:18,154
[SPEAKER_24]: It would be offered in whatever the policy subcommittee or rules subcommittee decides.

2121
03:19:19,977 --> 03:19:22,698
[SPEAKER_27]: We haven't voted on anything in the rules that the committee recommends.

2122
03:19:22,738 --> 03:19:23,899
[SPEAKER_24]: No, but I just mean in the future.

2123
03:19:24,919 --> 03:19:26,120
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm trying to use an example.

2124
03:19:28,121 --> 03:19:28,601
[SPEAKER_24]: Is that right?

2125
03:19:31,122 --> 03:19:32,443
[SPEAKER_27]: I didn't understand it that way either.

2126
03:19:32,463 --> 03:19:44,869
[SPEAKER_18]: I think the point of sending it to the subcommittee is so you can argue it out there about saying what makes sense to send, what's an ad hoc report.

2127
03:19:45,552 --> 03:19:48,974
[SPEAKER_18]: and does something like this qualify and how do you discern?

2128
03:19:49,454 --> 03:19:55,356
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's kind of my thinking about it is that there'll be multiple interesting discussions about this.

2129
03:20:00,158 --> 03:20:01,499
[SPEAKER_18]: That's why it's going to subcommittee.

2130
03:20:06,281 --> 03:20:11,383
[SPEAKER_18]: Not this resolution, what she's referring to with the ad hoc report, Mayor.

2131
03:20:13,924 --> 03:20:14,985
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, future resolutions.

2132
03:20:19,488 --> 03:20:20,849
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, you're going to have to figure that out.

2133
03:20:25,771 --> 03:20:27,172
[SPEAKER_27]: Subcommittee will discuss that.

2134
03:20:27,272 --> 03:20:27,672
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

2135
03:20:28,073 --> 03:20:30,034
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know if that's the right answer, but OK.

2136
03:20:30,634 --> 03:20:45,662
[SPEAKER_27]: Number seven, school committee resolution offered by Vice Chair Rousseau, a resolution in support of the Healthy Youth Act, H410, whereas comprehensive health education reduces sexual assault and harassment

2137
03:20:46,189 --> 03:21:15,330
[SPEAKER_27]: whereas it is important to educate children about how to build healthy, respectful relationships, whereas all children deserve medically accurate education, whereas the diversity of hunger gender expression is non-binary, whereas it is the responsibility of our public schools to educate all children, and whereas underrepresented sexual and gender minorities are disproportionately affected by inadequate health education, now therefore be it resolved that the Medford School

2138
03:21:16,169 --> 03:21:33,838
[SPEAKER_27]: School Committee of Medford, support the passage of House Bill 410, an action relative to healthy youth, urges the Massachusetts House of Representatives to bring this bill to a vote, and sends a letter of support to the Honorable Speaker DeLeo, the Honorable Mr. Donato, the Honorable Mr. Garbally, and the Honorable Ms.

2139
03:21:33,878 --> 03:21:34,258
[SPEAKER_27]: Barber.

2140
03:21:37,720 --> 03:21:38,300
[SPEAKER_27]: Member Ruseau.

2141
03:21:40,261 --> 03:21:41,882
[SPEAKER_34]: I would like to amend this to fix the

2142
03:21:43,152 --> 03:21:47,956
[SPEAKER_34]: After resolve it says an action relative to, it should be an act relative to healthy youth.

2143
03:21:48,957 --> 03:21:52,740
[SPEAKER_34]: But I've actually, sorry.

2144
03:21:53,541 --> 03:21:56,964
[SPEAKER_34]: And I have actually offered this last year and it was passed as well.

2145
03:21:57,885 --> 03:22:03,349
[SPEAKER_34]: The House continues to not actually take it up for a vote even though the Senate passes it.

2146
03:22:04,508 --> 03:22:08,869
[SPEAKER_34]: I believe even unanimously in their last vote, or close to unanimously.

2147
03:22:08,889 --> 03:22:10,670
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm sure there were a couple of holdouts.

2148
03:22:11,610 --> 03:22:19,952
[SPEAKER_34]: So this is not a controversial piece of legislation, unless of course you control what we actually vote on in the legislature.

2149
03:22:20,992 --> 03:22:28,174
[SPEAKER_34]: All this would do is require that public schools that do offer sexual health education actually do it.

2150
03:22:28,954 --> 03:22:31,115
[SPEAKER_34]: an accurate and correct job.

2151
03:22:32,476 --> 03:22:41,461
[SPEAKER_34]: If communities opt to not teach any sex ed at all, they can continue to pretend that life doesn't include this stuff.

2152
03:22:41,941 --> 03:22:51,906
[SPEAKER_34]: So I urge us to approve this and send this off to these folks to remind them that we actually do want this to pass.

2153
03:22:55,608 --> 03:22:57,770
[SPEAKER_27]: Motion for approval by Member Graham.

2154
03:22:58,210 --> 03:22:58,470
[SPEAKER_34]: Second.

2155
03:22:58,980 --> 03:23:00,242
[SPEAKER_27]: Seconded by Member Ruseau.

2156
03:23:00,763 --> 03:23:01,564
[SPEAKER_27]: All those in favor?

2157
03:23:01,584 --> 03:23:02,345
[SPEAKER_34]: Aye.

2158
03:23:03,226 --> 03:23:03,927
[SPEAKER_27]: All those opposed?

2159
03:23:04,648 --> 03:23:05,368
[SPEAKER_27]: Paper passes.

2160
03:23:05,769 --> 03:23:06,129
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

2161
03:23:06,890 --> 03:23:14,260
[SPEAKER_27]: We have school safety and procedural update offered by Member McLaughlin.

2162
03:23:19,144 --> 03:23:19,584
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2163
03:23:20,204 --> 03:23:31,349
[SPEAKER_24]: So I had had an agenda request for a school safety procedural update be added to the agenda and it was unfortunately put under requested reports.

2164
03:23:31,389 --> 03:23:33,630
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm not looking for a report per se.

2165
03:23:33,670 --> 03:23:34,230
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm looking for

2166
03:23:34,790 --> 03:23:37,292
[SPEAKER_24]: I hope that doesn't constitute a report.

2167
03:23:37,332 --> 03:23:52,886
[SPEAKER_24]: But I think given the circumstances of the past two weeks with the question of, you know, process and protocol around this unidentified powder, which thankfully was resolved, and thank you all for your hard work on that.

2168
03:23:52,906 --> 03:23:57,349
[SPEAKER_24]: I know that was a lot of hours and energy and input.

2169
03:23:58,170 --> 03:24:01,153
[SPEAKER_24]: But understanding, and I think it's a longer conversation

2170
03:24:01,772 --> 03:24:22,863
[SPEAKER_27]: you know anybody has been certainly I have the brain power for tonight so I'd ask that this be moved to an agenda item for the next committee meeting as an agenda item motion to table as an agenda item till 224 seconded by member Rousseau all those in favor all those opposed paper passes

2171
03:24:23,570 --> 03:24:29,254
[SPEAKER_27]: Also offered by member McLaughlin, status of outstanding reports.

2172
03:24:29,514 --> 03:24:29,814
[SPEAKER_24]: Right.

2173
03:24:29,995 --> 03:24:36,879
[SPEAKER_24]: So this had also been our first school committee meeting as a new member had the list of requested reports.

2174
03:24:36,939 --> 03:24:39,901
[SPEAKER_24]: Our second did not have them on the agenda anymore.

2175
03:24:40,042 --> 03:24:45,585
[SPEAKER_24]: And then I was curious about what that was and where the status of the outstanding reports are.

2176
03:24:45,625 --> 03:24:47,727
[SPEAKER_24]: But since this topic is being moved to,

2177
03:24:48,567 --> 03:24:54,412
[SPEAKER_24]: the Rules, Policy and Equity Subcommittee of which I am a member.

2178
03:24:54,432 --> 03:25:02,319
[SPEAKER_24]: I am okay with moving this topic there and figuring out how we report to the public on these outstanding reports.

2179
03:25:03,720 --> 03:25:06,663
[SPEAKER_27]: So I can just send this to... Subcommittee.

2180
03:25:07,043 --> 03:25:08,764
[SPEAKER_27]: Rules, Policy and Equity Subcommittee.

2181
03:25:08,784 --> 03:25:09,045
[SPEAKER_27]: That's right.
