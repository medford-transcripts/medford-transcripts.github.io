    <p>[Barbara Kerr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=883.911s">I</a>  called that company in December just to see what kind of, what we could expect for the winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=889.314s">The</a>  roof has been fairly good until the last three or four years and then fairly bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=894.318s">So</a>  the building commissioner came out, they took care of the problem last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=899.121s">So</a>  we are, we're dry at the moment, the drains are clear, they cleared the roof, they pumped out all of the water and took the ice off. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=907.126s">We</a>  won't know what will happen until it rains again, but for the moment, we're okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=909.947s">Tomorrow,</a>  Mr. Moki and a roofer are coming out to walk around and the roofer is gonna give him an estimate for patches to get us through the winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=918.031s">And</a>  then I think in the spring, that report had three levels of repair, serious repair, and replacement. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=925.193s">So</a>  after he gets us through the winter, then we'll discuss what happens in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=930.936s">So</a>  the roof is about, it was put in in the late 90s, <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=934.946s">It's</a>  been pretty good. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=935.906s">They</a>  put it over skylights, so under some weird weather conditions, we would have leaks occasionally, but the last few years is the first time that we're having leaks really in the stack area, and the children's department, the first time was last year.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=949.489s">And</a>  I believe you had mentioned that 100 books were ruined. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=952.29s">100</a>  books, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=952.67s">100</a>  books were ruined.</p>

    <p>[Barbara Kerr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=953.071s">We've</a>  been very fortunate in that we're good at it now, so that when the ceiling tiles begin to get wet, they bow. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=960.034s">So</a>  we take them down and drain the water out. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=963.295s">So</a>  unless they come down in the night and the water comes down in the night, we've been good at catching it before there was any damage. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=969.178s">But</a>  this time we didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=970.999s">And</a>  we didn't once last year as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=973.1s">And</a>  we're a little concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=974.3s">We</a>  are good at the ceiling tiles. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=975.561s">But</a>  if one happened to fall and we didn't notice, <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=978.982s">a</a>  problem with people if someone's walking underneath it at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=981.643s">Hopefully</a>  the custodians are pro at spotting the wet ones.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=987.464s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=989.844s">If</a>  I may, whether the patching is enough for the winter, I don't feel like patchwork at the library in the long term is going to be beneficial for the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1000.987s">So</a>  I really hope the administration decides what we're going to do with the arts and the library and the Chevalier. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1007.792s">create</a>  a plan, and if we are—whether or not we're going to build on top of the library, which has been discussed, that we permanently fix the problem in the spring, if that's what the administration decides. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1019.939s">But</a>  I think a new roof is probably needed, especially in that section, and that's what should be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1025.421s">Since</a>  the library—I think 10 emails have come in with concerned parents and concerned people who frequent the library, that that's just something that, you know, should not happen, and it should be immediately fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1036.047s">Since</a>  then, I've also got complaints about roof leaking at the high school, the Volk. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1041.631s">I'm</a>  probably sure Councilor Marks will discuss the gym leaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1045.274s">There's</a>  barrels out in the gym. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1047.876s">So</a>  I think maybe if our administration would be amenable, we should evaluate all of our city built, the roofs of every single city and school building, just to make sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1058.884s">You</a>  know, the Columbus School, I was complaining about that roof. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1061.762s">last</a>  year and it wasn't until residents and the council and probably the school committee complained about it, that that was fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1068.205s">It</a>  took too long. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1070.146s">And</a>  I think that's the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1071.327s">So</a>  if we have money to do other things in the city, hire new positions and things like that, I think we should have money to maintain our roofs.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1079.091s">It</a>  was amended by Councilor, Vice President Lungo-Koehn that an assessment be done of the maintenance and repair needs of all municipal buildings.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1086.571s">The</a>  worse your roofs get, the worse public property gets damaged, the worse the building inside is going to get. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1093.313s">And</a>  it just creates a chain reaction. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1096.274s">And</a>  this council has spoken up a number of times about a maintenance budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1100.355s">We</a>  should have a maintenance budget in the city and school side. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1103.056s">And</a>  roofs should be the top priority.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1106.397s">Thank</a>  you, Madam Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1108.958s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1111.219s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1112.499s">And</a>  thank you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1113.359s">Clark,</a>  for such a thorough presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1116.076s">As</a>  we're all aware, the money bills come from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1119.778s">And</a>  at Sunday's inaugural ceremony, Mayor Burke expressed such a desire to establish a five-year capital plan that I think, you know, timing's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1129.022s">We're</a>  really striking when the iron's hot. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1130.923s">I</a>  think that it's very important that those concerned <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1134.091s">with</a>  the maintenance needs at the library, be sure to attend Monday's meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1139.055s">Monday,</a>  the 11th at 7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1141.197s">at</a>  the Medford Arts Council, the Burke Transition Team's Cultural Affairs and Recreation Committee is scheduled to meet at 7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1148.864s">And</a>  I don't think that there's anything more significant in terms of cultural affairs than our library, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1155.33s">So</a>  I feel as though it will be very important for those residents out there that do have a concern and do have <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1160.16s">a</a>  desire to see more funding at our public library to participate in these meetings as well as they come forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1165.324s">I</a>  certainly support a five-year capital plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1167.725s">I</a>  certainly support a maintenance plan for our buildings, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1170.407s">I</a>  think it's something that all of us behind this rail have been preaching for a number of months. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1174.922s">With</a>  that being said, Mr. President, I just wanted to be sure that everybody was aware that the transition team will be meeting on Monday, a week from yesterday, at the Medford Heights Council Space at the Meadow Glen Mall to discuss issues like this and what we're gonna do moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1187.988s">So</a>  I think it's a welcome breath of fresh air to have an opportunity to come to a meeting like this, a community meeting, Mr. President, and I'm looking forward to it.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1195.951s">Thank</a>  you very much, Councilor Neitzel. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1197.252s">On</a>  the motion of approval on the resolution by Councilor Caraviello, as amended by Councilors Caraviello, <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1204.625s">and</a>  Lungo-Koehn share recognizes for the first time, Councilor Falco.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1209.588s">Thank</a>  you, President Dello Russo, and thank you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1211.69s">Kerr,</a>  for your report. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1214.572s">When</a>  I got the report, I read over the report, and it is troubling to see some of the issues with the roof. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1220.456s">And</a>  I definitely support fixing the roof, but I'd like to actually see if we can amend, actually, the original resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1228.862s">And</a>  what I'd like to see is, I would like to see a comprehensive review <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1234.496s">of</a>  the library, not only just the roof, but the entire building. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1238.478s">I</a>  would like to see a report come to the council, a comprehensive review of everything, the structure of the building, which I'm sure it's safe and I'm sure it's sound. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1246.801s">I'm</a>  not an engineer, but I'd like to see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1249.362s">How</a>  old is the furnace? <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1250.562s">I</a>  mean, basically a whole review of the entire building. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1255.544s">You</a>  know, I know we recently, we had the bathrooms fixed, I believe recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1259.456s">But</a>  I think we should look at everything from the bathrooms to the elevator to the roof. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1262.917s">We</a>  should look at the whole entire building. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1264.417s">We</a>  have to think about the future, the future of this building. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1267.738s">This</a>  building is, I think, at least 60 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1270.839s">We</a>  need to look at the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1271.899s">This</a>  is a community asset. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1273.099s">This</a>  is an important asset that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1274.94s">It's</a>  used by the youth. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1276.36s">It's</a>  used by the seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1277.801s">It's</a>  used by everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1279.081s">And</a>  we really need to take a look at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1281.502s">So</a>  I'd like to see if we can amend that to get a whole comprehensive review of the library structure.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1289.047s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1289.567s">So</a>  as, uh, on the motion of Councilor Caraviello, as amended by Councilor, uh, Falco, uh, chair recognizes councilor Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1297.453s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1298.394s">Barbara.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1298.854s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1299.334s">Um,</a>  I mean, in my four years on the council, I've gone to the mass municipal association show every year and every year they have the library building fund there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1308.121s">And</a>  I've asked every year if Medford has applied for funds for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1311.963s">And</a>  I was told every year, no, I mean, um, is that, I don't know if that fund is still going to be available this year, but the show was good. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1318.863s">But</a>  the master show is in a couple of weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1321.286s">I</a>  intend to attend there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1322.387s">And</a>  I said, if the library building fund is there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1325.151s">Is</a>  that the state? <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1328.155s">The</a>  state, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1330.277s">No,</a>  it was the state building for libraries. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1332.38s">And</a>  every year when I go there, I go up to the booth there and I ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1335.984s">And</a>  they said, we've never applied for funds.</p>

    <p>[Barbara Kerr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1340.343s">Oh,</a>  what do we do? <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1343.565s">I</a>  know we were not eligible for library commissioners construction funds until we submitted a strategic plan last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1354.354s">So</a>  we are now, we are now, but I'm not sure if that's the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1359.138s">I'm</a>  curious to see what that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1360.599s">I'm</a>  not sure.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1360.979s">It</a>  was a library building fund that was there and they, they gave money. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1364.482s">They</a>  had money in grants for rebuilding and putting up new libraries.</p>

    <p>[Barbara Kerr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1368.543s">Well,</a>  that might be interesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1369.444s">The</a>  one, as I understand it, if you want me to do the outline, the Board of Library Commissioners releases grant funding sporadically these days. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1378.209s">It</a>  used to be every five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1379.87s">The</a>  last time was 2010. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1381.971s">They're</a>  anticipating 2020, which we would not be ready for for a number of reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1387.334s">If</a>  they did it in 2025 or 2030, we would be ready to apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1391.677s">So</a>  I'm not sure if that's a separate thing.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1393.398s">Yeah,</a>  well, I think the show was on the 20th or the 21st. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1398.011s">of</a>  January at the Sheridan in Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1400.913s">I</a>  plan to attend again. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1403.074s">And</a>  if they're there, I'm going to hopefully get some more literature and maybe we can help get some help in there.</p>

    <p>[Barbara Kerr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1408.978s">Because</a>  that's possibly a whole different source of funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1411.62s">It's</a>  not something I'm aware of if it's a different thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1413.661s">So</a>  hey, why not?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1415.982s">And</a>  as Councilor Falco mentioned, we spent the money on the bathroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1420.325s">I</a>  don't think the money was very well spent on the bathroom.</p>

    <p>[Barbara Kerr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1423.067s">We're</a>  going to do some better homes and gardens on it.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1424.588s">I</a>  was in there last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1428.957s">I</a>  don't know, I don't know where that money was spent that we, that was appropriate for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1438.382s">That</a>  didn't look like, uh, that amount of money had spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1442.945s">So</a>  we're going to try again when I go to the show next week, I'll see, I'll see what's there again.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1451.77s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1452.13s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1453.311s">Chair</a>  recognizes for the first time, <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1456.347s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1458.047s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1459.968s">I</a>  think it's important that we've discussed this and try to find a way to add this to the amendment, but look into, um, uh, and I thinking outside the box and looking at, you know, when you're talking about a roof and you're talking about bathrooms, when we're talking about the library infrastructure, how bad or how good it is, I'd like to see with that report is to also investigate, you know, other facilities within our community and see if there's ways that we can, <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1486.182s">You</a>  know, use different buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1488.783s">I'll</a>  give an example. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1490.203s">If</a>  we look right next door to Springstep and said, if there's square footage there to put both a library and an arts center and use that to bring everything here with the infrastructure strong and new and updated, and then look at the land that has the library and look to sell that land off to a developer, I think that's something that I'd like to <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1514.346s">you</a>  know, entertain as we go forward that when you're talking about big, big money, uh, and you talk about how, how we, we reinvested into the schools and we built the so-called new schools and how we moved forward with that thinking outside the box and, and really looking to bring a library to the 21st century. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1533.516s">I</a>  think it's important.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1534.997s">Um,</a>  so thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1536.858s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1537.418s">So</a>  as amended, uh, by councilor Scappelli that the, uh, review of the, uh, uh, buildings use, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1544.784s">also</a>  encompass, uh, additional land use and, uh, alternative land use, uh, for the, uh, library building itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1557.207s">Uh,</a>  chair recognizes Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1560.147s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1560.947s">I</a>  want to thank councilor Caraviello for putting this on the agenda and for Barbara sending us the report that was commissioned by the public library, uh, to, uh, take a look at the roof. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1574.49s">and</a>  the current condition and what needs to take place in order to bring that roof up to code. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1580.093s">And</a>  to me, much of what has taken place over the last several years, from what I can gather from the report, is the report is not allowing proper drainage. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1592.781s">And</a>  many of the drains up on the roof aren't in proper location to catch the water that's draining. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1601.266s">The</a>  water's not draining to that location <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1604.272s">And</a>  much of it seems to me just a lack of just small maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1609.195s">Someone</a>  would go up in the roof and take a broom and sweep the debris around the drains. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1614.919s">I</a>  mean, I do that in my home on my gutters. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1617.941s">And</a>  it's just basic maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1620.662s">And</a>  I think a lot of the pooling that we see up on the roof from the pitches would be prevented just based on simple, simple maintenance that could be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1633.605s">The</a>  report talked about standing water, which I think some of it could be accomplished through the re-sloping and pitching of some areas, the top roof and the lower roof. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1645.751s">And</a>  it also talked about mortar around the windows and around the sunlights. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1650.974s">And</a>  that's just basic maintenance, because if you have mortar, as we know, the last time the roof was replaced was in 1990. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1658.958s">That's</a>  25 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1662.675s">that's</a>  what the report said, 1990. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1664.656s">Um,</a>  so that's 25 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1668.138s">And,</a>  um, you know, any, any roof, uh, although you would hope you'd get 25 to 30 years, especially in a commercial type setting, uh, you need to have that maintenance over time, which as we know, the public library over the last several years has been severely underfunded. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1685.265s">And,</a>  uh, we're seeing that through lack of positions in the library, <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1689.021s">And</a>  maintenance, as we know throughout the whole system, we see our roof's been leaking here at City Hall for many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1696.803s">I</a>  attended an event at the high school gymnasium cages, and there had to be 12 or 13 barrels set up strategically catching water from leaks in the ceiling. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1708.386s">You</a>  know, you go into the police department, the evidence room has been leaking for years, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1715.728s">The</a>  fire stations, we have many concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1718.381s">in</a>  our fire station. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1719.762s">And</a>  this council is asked for because, you know, it's great to have Paul Moky, and we've discussed this with the building commissioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1727.605s">He</a>  is the building commissioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1728.846s">He's</a>  in charge of all the different heads down there, from code enforcement to plumbing to electrical inspectors. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1737.61s">But</a>  he is not the building supervisor for all the public buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1743.072s">He's</a>  not the supervisor. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1744.893s">And</a>  as was mentioned, I think Barbara mentioned it, <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1747.848s">that</a>  when there were leaks in the building over the last couple of years, no one ever thought to call Paul Mokey up because it's never been that way in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1759.115s">Paul</a>  doesn't go out and inspect our buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1762.076s">And</a>  this council has asked for a buildings and grounds manager for several years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1768.82s">Someone</a>  that would be in charge of all the municipal buildings to make sure there's a maintenance budget in place, to make sure the small preventative items <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1777.018s">Like</a>  I said, someone to go up with a broom. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1779.24s">That's</a>  doesn't take a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1780.761s">It's</a>  sweep around the drains, uh, you know, very basic things, but there's, there's no oversight. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1786.905s">There's</a>  really a lack of oversight. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1789.427s">And</a>  you would think the public library is in a different country from a city hall, from the fire stations to the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1796.833s">It's</a>  all like it's own little separate nations. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1799.315s">And,</a>  uh, really until we get this all under one umbrella, uh, in my opinion, a buildings and grounds manager would accomplish. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1807.063s">The</a>  public schools have a building and grounds manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1810.464s">And</a>  I'm not saying they should or shouldn't have one, but they have someone that's in charge of overseeing the maintenance of all the buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1817.206s">And</a>  in my opinion, that's needed on the city side, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1821.028s">We</a>  also talked about a long-term capital improvement plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1824.449s">I</a>  know the public library recently, within the last six months, Barbara, put together a proposal on what the vision is for the public library over the long-term vision. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1836.875s">And</a>  I, like many members behind this council, would like to see, uh, maybe the second floor expanded. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1842.397s">Uh,</a>  I think, uh, in my opinion, from what I heard from, uh, people in the know in the community is the, the building is structurally sound. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1850.919s">Um,</a>  and the footprint itself is probably workable. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1853.6s">The</a>  second floor has room for expansion and, um, you know, I'd, I'd like to see work take place on the roof, but I'd like to see an overall picture as was mentioned by some of the members of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1864.623s">What's</a>  our vision? <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1866.028s">of</a>  the public library? <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1867.309s">Can</a>  we envision maybe a mixed use? <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1871.111s">Could</a>  we see maybe adding a little cafe in the public library where people can go and have a cup of coffee in Danish or something like that and also have use of the library or maybe involve more of a community space in the public library? <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1886.718s">I</a>  know we have a community space there now, but maybe enhance that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1890.06s">So</a>  these are the things I think, Mr. President, that we have to look at because <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1894.428s">If</a>  you look at each of the estimate ranges regarding repair, retrofit and replacement of the roof, and it breaks it down from the canopy, which is that exterior strip around the library to the high roof, which is the second level to the lower roof repair. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1914.362s">If</a>  we were just going to look at repair to accomplish the leaks that we have right now, solve the leaks you're looking at about <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1921.576s">mid-range</a>  of the estimates, about $15,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1923.917s">That's</a>  just to accomplish what we have for leaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1928.099s">Now,</a>  if you wanted a retrofit and do more of a long-term fix, like some of the flashing on the roof, fix some of the mortar, some of the skylights that need to be replaced, and so forth, you're looking at, to retrofit, and this would be the canopy, the high roof, and the low roof, about $108,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1945.747s">And</a>  then to do a total replacement, according to the estimates, <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1950.416s">And</a>  this is just the middle of the estimate. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1952.837s">It's</a>  like Councilor Caraviello mentioned, it's closer to 600,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1957.239s">So</a>  as you can see, there's a great disparity among what, you know, if the city just wants to accomplish a quick fix, 15,000, I'm sure we can find that in some account, or if they want to look at a long-term approach, which according to the report would extend, if we looked at the retrofit and replacement, you're looking at an extension of, <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1979.794s">a</a>  life in the roof for 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1982.075s">So</a>  I think these are the things that we have to consider. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1984.316s">Um,</a>  and also, uh, what, uh, we'd like to see, uh, I like, uh, councilor Scarpelli's idea, you know, thinking outside the box, I'll refresh it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=1996.161s">Uh,</a>  because we've mentioned that building for a potential police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2000.703s">We've</a>  mentioned it for a public library. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2002.604s">We've</a>  mentioned it for an art center. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2004.324s">And</a>  I agree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2005.045s">It's</a>  a stone throw from city hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2007.045s">It's</a>  a beautiful facade. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2009.277s">And</a>  I think we can work that building into whatever we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2012.539s">And</a>  I think that's a great suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2015.041s">And</a>  hopefully, with this new administration, we'll be able to experience some thinking outside the box. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2021.804s">But</a>  I just want to make, Mr. President, a recommendation that, once again, this council go on record asking that a building grounds manager be hired to oversee all of our <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2037.474s">municipal</a>  buildings in the community, and that any long-term plan, I know in the Mayor Burke's inaugural, she mentioned in her speech a long-term capital improvement plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2050.859s">I</a>  would hope the library, which I'm sure is included in that, also has a particular item for maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2059.102s">And</a>  I think it was Councilor Penta for the last 10 years, he's talked about a lot of things, but one thing he did talk about which made a lot of sense <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2066.955s">was,</a>  in our budget process, to have at least 3 to 5 percent allocated for maintenance within the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2074.56s">And</a>  I know it's probably the first cost that you say, well, times are tough. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2078.163s">We</a>  can do away with that particular maintenance cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2082.026s">But</a>  it really pays itself tenfold when you keep after your property. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2085.989s">Any</a>  of us that are property owners know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2088.35s">And</a>  I think we're bearing the fruit of neglect for so many years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2095.657s">what's</a>  taking place after neglect and lack of maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2099.118s">So,</a>  I would offer those recommendations, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2102.199s">Buildings</a>  Ground Manager, a long-term capital improvement plan issued by this city, and also a legitimate — I sat in the budget hearings with the former director of the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2116.783s">And</a>  as you just mentioned, the library didn't have a problem with leaks for many years, but in the last four or five years, there were problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2124.841s">And</a>  unless my hearing was bad during our budget deliberations, I have never once heard the director, with all due respect to the former director, mention anything about the concern of leaks in the public library. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2139.306s">And</a>  that concerns me, because I'm sure someone that spends eight to 10 hours a day there, five days a week, would know better off what's going on in the building and the needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2151.211s">So</a>  those are my comments, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2154.798s">And</a>  if I could just comment on Councilor Caraviello, because it was my recommendation back three years ago to allocate $10,000 to, uh, towards the restrooms at the public library. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2167.386s">I</a>  refer to them as prison bathrooms because in my opinion, when I went into the bathrooms, I've never been in prison, but I would assume they look like prison bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2179.414s">And,</a>  uh, indeed the city administration, uh, agreed with my comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2184.553s">put</a>  $10,000 in the budget, and $10,000 worth of improvements were made to the women's and the men's restroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2194.075s">And</a>  a new buzzer system was put in, a new system, which wasn't adequately working at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2200.057s">And</a>  I agree, it doesn't look like a lot was done, but many of the fixtures were changed in the bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2206.478s">The</a>  changing table was fixed in the women's room. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2210.719s">And</a>  the concern of privacy <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2213.722s">because</a>  before you'd be buzzed in and someone could be in the woman's restroom, and there was a lot of issues around it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2219.005s">But</a>  there was something done. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2220.707s">It</a>  wasn't up to my standard, but I have to say the administration did do something there, Mr. President, and a lot more is needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2229.272s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2232.374s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2234.315s">Thank</a>  you very much, Mr. President, and thank you, Councilor Knox, because I think that that pretty much sums up the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2239.901s">relatively</a>  well from start to finish, soup to nuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2242.522s">Um,</a>  I think that, um, you know, we're, we're looking at a building here that certainly needs a preventative maintenance plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2247.564s">We</a>  have a number of city buildings that need that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2250.245s">Um,</a>  and as I sit here and I listened to, uh, the discussion about this issue, uh, I think back to, uh, recent weeks when we were at the library, many of us for a dedication of the reading room to the late Richard Lee and in attorney Romney's address. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2266.05s">Um,</a>  he said something that really stood out to me and this discussion really <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2269.987s">makes</a>  me think of it, Mr. President, it was that out of all the public buildings that we have in the city of Medford, the library is really the only one that people go to voluntarily. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2280.721s">You</a>  got to figure. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2282.101s">You</a>  come to City Hall to pay a tax bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2283.902s">You</a>  go to the police department to I don't know what. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2288.183s">But</a>  ultimately, the library is a building where people go for recreational purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2292.385s">And</a>  I think that the value of a strong public library has been minimized. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2298.747s">And</a>  I think that we're on the right track right now, Mr. President, to really put together a strong plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2303.308s">However,</a>  it has to be a partnership. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2304.548s">It</a>  has to be a plan that the administration is going to buy into as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2307.809s">So</a>  I certainly think that <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2310.417s">you</a>  know, it's a breath of fresh air to see this council come together and come up with some great solutions and great ideas as to how we'd like to see this move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2317.682s">But</a>  ultimately, if it's a money bill, it's going to come from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2320.264s">So</a>  we need to work cooperatively with them, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2322.865s">So</a>  with that being said, I just really wanted to reflect a little bit on the fact that, you know, a public library is really the only building that people come into voluntarily in the city and they do it because it's a great place to bring your family. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2333.052s">It's</a>  a great place to, <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2334.339s">relax,</a>  unwind, have some peace, some quiet, and trust me, I need a lot more of that lately than I have in the past, Mr. President, with the new baby in the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2341.625s">So</a>  I'm very fortunate to live across the street from the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2345.708s">But</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, I move for approval on the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2348.85s">The</a>  President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2350.432s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2350.932s">On</a>  the motion of approval on the paper of Councilor Caraviello, as amended by Councilors Caraviello, Lungo-Koehn, Falco, Scarpelli, and Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2359.539s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2361.32s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2361.88s">You</a>  know, Councilor Scarpelli brought up <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2364.332s">Springsteep</a>  when I proposed that the city buy it some years ago, it was $2.1 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2370.013s">Now</a>  I understand it's close to $5 million for the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2373.754s">So</a>  again, I think if we, if we had jumped on it, then it would have been a steal.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2378.655s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2380.155s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2380.575s">Counsel</a>  Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2381.536s">So</a>  on the motion of approval, we have a number of citizens wish to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2384.616s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2384.816s">Curt,</a>  do you wish to continue? <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2386.097s">No,</a>  I just want to thank you all very much for your good work, your diligence and your advocacy.</p>

    <p>[Barbara Kerr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2391.558s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2394.158s">Good</a>  evening, please state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2397.822s">Sarah</a>  Beardsley, 38 Warren Street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2401.186s">I</a>  just wanted to correct a statement by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2405.852s">The</a>  Arts, Recreation and Culture meeting which is taking place on the 11th is at the Medford Arts Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2414.522s">Medford</a>  Arts Council is a totally different group. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2418.725s">And</a>  just for the record too, we're having another meeting also on the 20th of this month. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2423.849s">Um,</a>  unfortunately that will be our last meeting there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2427.692s">Uh,</a>  because Medford Arts Center has to look for a new home. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2431.575s">Um,</a>  and we're closing on the 31st.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2434.077s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2435.718s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2438.02s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2438.561s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Sednick]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2441.6s">My</a>  name is Samantha Sednik. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2443.341s">My</a>  address is 47 West Wyoming Avenue in Melrose, and I'm your children's librarian. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2450.367s">And</a>  I just wanted to address the books that were lost. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2454.43s">So</a>  when the initial emails were kind of going and being posted, we did state that we lost <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2459.574s">a</a>  little over 100 books during the current leak. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2462.575s">The</a>  Children's Room, as Barbara mentioned, hasn't had a lot of leaks up until quite recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2467.757s">Last</a>  year, we did lose an entire shelf of reference books, which were a lot more expensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2474.339s">But</a>  the silver lining to this is that people of Medford really, truly love their library. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2479.3s">And</a>  I posted a wish list online, and within a day, all 100 books had been privately donated back to the library, and our collection has been restored. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2492.248s">So</a>  in terms of thinking outside of the box or looking forward to the future of the library, the citizens of Medford would like you to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2500.732s">Um,</a>  and, and had been very, very supportive of us and we, we appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2505.834s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2506.754s">Thank</a>  you, Sam. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2509.435s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2509.956s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Melanie Raelin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2511.936s">Hi,</a>  I'm Melanie railing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2513.117s">I'm</a>  at 20 Stanley Avenue in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2515.158s">Obviously.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2516.987s">So</a>  I just wanted to pretty much reiterate Councilor Marx's comments in particular What's our vision for the future of I think you said what's our vision of the public library? <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2526.721s">And</a>  really the question is what is the future of our library? <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2529.85s">You</a>  know, as Councilor Lungo-Kearns said, you know, just patches is just a temporary solution for something that it really is the heart of our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2538.381s">Right</a>  now, we know, I don't know if you guys are aware, the Medford Mackey, for example, is losing its art space. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2545.089s">The</a>  maker space is currently <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2546.995s">looking</a>  for a home and the library is offering to be a temporary host for the Mackey Makerspace. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2552.217s">It</a>  hosts Medford Family Network programs that are essential and were part, I mean, as Councilor Knight speaks about his young child, I mean, it helped me learn how to become a really great parent. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2561.321s">And</a>  the accessibility of the library being walkable is really important to think about as we look at providing services for the residents in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2570.005s">Having</a>  stuff at the mall or far away at other places doesn't really serve our community the way we need it to, and the library really is in this amazing place. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2578.627s">We</a>  talk about wanting to activate the waterfront, the library is right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2581.748s">We</a>  talk about wanting to bring in a playground, bring in green space. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2585.209s">Let's</a>  look at examples such as Winchester, which has a gorgeous outside as well as inside, an amazing programming space. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2591.59s">You</a>  know, yes, Cambridge might have the most beautiful library, and maybe that's not what we're looking at, but we can look at real examples like the Fox Library. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2598.815s">You</a>  know, there's so much talk about a cafe. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2600.296s">What</a>  about a store where we create, sell, use items and then create income for the library so that we can continue to offer these programs and technologies? <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2609.762s">And</a>  other examples, the Somerville Libraries, they're actually going to be redoing a lot of those <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2615.486s">in</a>  the next couple of years and are seeking community input. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2618.847s">But</a>  they are a big public space for baby-wearing meetings, for business meetings, group meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2625.168s">As</a>  one of the co-founders of the Medford Community Coalition, we're always struggling with a place to meet so that we can have our, we have 1,250 followers now, and many of them are supporters of the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2635.97s">And</a>  in fact, Councilor Lungo-Koehn said that <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2639.691s">There</a>  were 10 families who expressed their concern, but really there are hundreds of families who are behind this library, as evidenced by the May and June meetings of the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2648.519s">And</a>  we do also encourage you, as you speak about this now, not to forget the library when it comes to the budget again in May and June. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2654.724s">It's</a>  very clear that <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2656.005s">The</a>  bare minimum of $251,000 is not cutting it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2659.346s">It's</a>  just getting us at the base mark. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2662.406s">And</a>  finally, there's talks about Springstep, and we love this idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2667.227s">Councilor</a>  Scarpielli, that's so wonderful to think out of the box. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2670.448s">Springstep</a>  is smaller than the current library space. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2673.148s">I</a>  mean, that's something really important to think about. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2675.349s">It's</a>  also angled, and as our children's librarian pointed out to me, it can't support the weight of the books. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2681.21s">Also,</a>  the library is deeded to be a library space that land, so maybe we should be thinking more about moving things out temporarily and rebuilding that whole building. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2690.08s">Of</a>  course, that's a lot of money, but we have to think about where our priorities are. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2693.603s">So</a>  it's wonderful to hear you all talk about these assessments and also the fact that there is a five-year plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2700.054s">Thanks</a>  to Mayor Muccini-Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2702.594s">And</a>  that is a big reason why many of these grants, these library building grants, haven't been accessible to us because we were not part of and there was no five-year plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2711.636s">So</a>  to answer that question, now that there is this plan, it's not just the library moving forward, it's really everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2717.137s">So</a>  things to think about. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2718.757s">Let's</a>  think about our future and let's really build something that really represents the amazing community that Medford is. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2723.618s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2955.082s">Stephanie</a>  Burke was one of our strongest allies when it came to public access TV. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2959.445s">This</a>  is the opportunity to show the community that we're going to start immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2964.048s">Let's</a>  make an agreement with the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2965.83s">Let's</a>  get some of that money. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2967.491s">Let's</a>  get it up and running. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2968.392s">Let's</a>  fix that second floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2970.273s">Let's</a>  make it a place that attracts people, because I will leave you with this thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2974.656s">I'm</a>  often at, I was at the Reading Library just now, and I'm usually at the Winchester Library or Burlington Library, gorgeous buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2983.352s">Gorgeous.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2984.413s">The</a>  new Reading Library is going to be stunning, and we're in a temporary zone right now because I'm a member of Reading Cable as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2991.322s">And</a>  the Cable and the libraries, they all work well together. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2994.686s">We</a>  must move Medford forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=2997.269s">We</a>  must be partners in progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3000.328s">It's</a>  not just a slogan. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3001.489s">Let's</a>  do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3002.649s">This</a>  is how we do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3003.57s">Let's</a>  do it right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3004.951s">I</a>  will be at those meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3006.772s">I</a>  will be at those cultural meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3009.353s">This</a>  is very important to me, not for me, but for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3013.695s">Because,</a>  come on, I'm an old man. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3015.797s">How</a>  much time do I have left? <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3017.157s">I'm</a>  doing this for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3018.298s">I'm</a>  not a young man like Mr. Falco or Mr. Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3021.62s">I'm</a>  an old man. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3022.58s">Help</a>  me out before I die. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3024.261s">Give</a>  me my access station.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3516.362s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3517.163s">I</a>  don't know if people have noticed, but the temporary bridge is up and going now, and they're starting to work on the old bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3525.769s">At</a>  the beginning of the road there, the road is quite open and wide there, and I was with, the other night, I was having dinner with our state representative Donato, and we were discussing how possibly we could put some parking spaces, maybe half a dozen parking spaces in front of there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3545.947s">that</a>  part of Main Street during the construction time, seeing that there's nothing there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3550.348s">And</a>  when I talked to Representative Denial this morning, he had explained to me that he had spoken to the construction people and the people from the DOT, and they think that is a very good possibility to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3562.671s">And</a>  I would think that the businesses that are affected the most could benefit from maybe those extra half a dozen parking spaces over there during this construction time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3574.963s">So</a>  I don't know if this goes to the Traffic Commission or we do that on our own, but I think it would be a good gesture to do that.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3582.227s">Perhaps</a>  we send it to the administration to make a decision and disseminate it to the appropriate department. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3591.972s">Always</a>  an advocate for business. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3593.573s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3595.134s">Chair</a>  recognizes Vice President Longo-Curran.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3597.015s">Thank</a>  you, President Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3598.696s">Also,</a>  with that, if we can look into, as I drove by, <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3603.417s">looks</a>  like there's Jersey barriers from the auto school all the way down to the section into the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3609.741s">So</a>  anybody that wants to frequent say, you know, Carol's restaurant or ERA Realty has to walk, you know, all the way around. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3617.525s">If</a>  that could just be looked at to see if it's possible to maybe make a gap in one of the barriers, possible temporary crosswalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3624.669s">I'm</a>  not sure if that's, you know, feasible, but if they can look into that possibility, um, there was a, <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3631.378s">section</a>  in the Island that was, you know, clear of, you know, shrubs so that people could cross the road in a safe manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3639.544s">So</a>  if that could be looked into as well.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3642.186s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3642.726s">As</a>  amended by vice president Logan current. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3645.468s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3645.928s">Madam</a>  vice president chair recognizes council night.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3648.71s">Um,</a>  Mr. President, in looking at the resolution, uh, be a result of the city council, look into the possibility of a temporary parking on main street during the credit bridge reconstruction. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3656.776s">I</a>  certainly have no problem with that, but, um, as councilor Caraviello, <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3660.501s">initiated</a>  and cited as you did as well, would it be appropriate for the traffic commission to review this, the administration to review this, or the city council's subcommittee on transportation, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3670.484s">I</a>  think that by taking a two-fold approach, we'll be much more successful in actually accomplishing the objective, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3676.526s">So</a>  I think that it would make sense if we are going to, in fact, <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3679.51s">send</a>  a paper to the administration to look into it, that we also hold a transportation subcommittee meeting and have the administration come before us and explain to us the reasoning why they feel as though this is a bad idea, whether or not there are public safety issues that surround it, what the traffic commission's position is on it as well, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3695.204s">It's</a>  going to be very important as to whether or not this really happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3698.327s">So</a>  I think that, you know, as we look at the end result and how to get to the solution, I think that it would make more sense, Mr. President, for us to send a <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3705.742s">correspondence</a>  to the administration, but also hold a subcommittee meeting where the individuals that are in a position to set this policy will be able to appear before us and explain to us why it is or is not a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3715.167s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3715.587s">So,</a>  uh, we'll do this.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3717.008s">We</a>  will, if you could, uh, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3718.789s">Uh,</a>  I, I, I agree with council and I'd only be, uh, for one point is because I'm, I'm really not happy about where they're anticipating moving the bus stop to, which is for what I understand under the bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3729.354s">And</a>  I don't think that's a probably a place to move that bus stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3732.196s">I</a>  think it should be, <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3733.805s">possibly</a>  on Riverside Avenue, maybe turn River Street for a short time into one way going the opposite way.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3741.231s">I</a>  was under the impression that it was going to stay where it was, but I may be mistaken. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3745.434s">In</a>  any event, if we- Yeah, let's have an update on that from the administration.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3749.737s">According</a>  to the representative, it was going to be moved further down.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3753.58s">And</a>  we're also going to send this to the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3757.822s">And</a>  also the, uh, chair, uh, pro tempore of the, uh, transportation committee will call a meeting, uh, for that since we can't send the paper to places at once. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3769.988s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3770.608s">So</a>  there's a, uh, an amendment that the, uh, chair call the subcommittee meetings on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3777.171s">Uh,</a>  and, uh, we have a gentleman at the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3779.983s">who</a>  will shed light on this matter, and we invite you to state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3789.136s">This</a>  all came about that I have some friends that have done a lot of construction in similar situations that is going on right now down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3797.641s">They</a>  brought it to my attention that in projects in the past, that this has been an occurrence that has happened as being allowed to have some sort of parking in the construction area when construction isn't going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3811.965s">At</a>  that time, we talked to Rick, and Paul was there, and we brought it to this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3818.843s">But</a>  there's a lot of other things going on down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3821.565s">As</a>  Brianna mentioned that they've got all those Jersey barriers right now blocking us off completely. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3827.889s">I'm</a>  a retail business. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3830.211s">I</a>  depend on traffic flow. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3832.012s">I'm</a>  not a professional business that has, you know, one appointment an hour that is somehow some way you're gonna make it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3838.597s">The</a>  people are deterred from any access whatsoever or difficult access. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3845.998s">They're</a>  not going to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3847.318s">You</a>  know, already we're shutting down for lunch as of this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3850.299s">We're</a>  not going to, the sidewalks are closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3852.58s">There's</a>  no way for people to get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3854.92s">And</a>  so I decided that as a Friday, we will just shut down for lunch. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3860.502s">You</a>  have companies showing up as of last night, nine o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3863.543s">They're</a>  not supposed to do work before 10 o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3866.243s">They're</a>  out there right in front of the place, blocking us, shutting us down. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3870.925s">No</a>  police detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3873.1s">They</a>  stretched the bus stops so far that people missed the buses, because their trucks were blocking people waiting for the buses. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3880.446s">And</a>  it's a little bit like the Wild Wild West going on down there right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3886.13s">Somewhere</a>  along the line, someone has to grab the horns of this thing and get it back under control, because right now it's a runaway train. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3896.917s">Paul</a>  Donato has set up a meeting with me with some of the powers to be tomorrow night. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3901.099s">That's</a>  all fine and good. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3902.08s">We've</a>  met, we've talked, we had meetings before this construction even started. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3905.862s">They</a>  were going to be the best things since sliced bread. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3910.204s">And</a>  the lack of communication and just steamrolling the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3915.227s">Whatever</a>  they want to do, they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3918.229s">And</a>  we need help. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3919.87s">I'll</a>  tell you right now, we need help.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3937.815s">I</a>  don't know if we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3939.936s">I</a>  haven't received an update on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3941.517s">Has</a>  anybody, any of the Councilors? <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3944.819s">That's</a>  telling. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3946.342s">if</a>  they haven't with this issue?</p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3947.922s">I'm</a>  supposed to be on the email and I got a forward to me from other people and I questioned the project manager on behalf of DOT. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3954.844s">He</a>  said, you're there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3955.845s">I</a>  checked my junk. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3956.845s">I</a>  checked the vice mayor, nothing there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3960.166s">I</a>  believe they put them out every, either every two or three weeks, they put them out George. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3964.987s">When</a>  they have their, when they have their meetings, they have their progress report meetings either every two or three weeks where they meet with OCD supposedly, they meet with DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3975.848s">We've</a>  never been informed or privy to any of these meetings up to this point.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3996.968s">We</a>  did. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=3997.809s">Maybe</a>  if you could forward it to the whole council, that would be good. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4001.767s">Also,</a>  when they did give the email, I was notifying department heads within City Hall, make sure you email Dan from DOT to get on an email list. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4011.791s">I</a>  think that tells you what you need to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4014.572s">We</a>  need to have a department head, and it seems like the shuffle game is being played because there's really no specific department that controls DOT, but somebody within City Hall, whether that's OCD or building or, <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4030.364s">DPW,</a>  somebody needs to get involved with this situation so there is a contact within City Hall that can help the businesses, help the people that traverse our sidewalks, help what's going on down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4043.969s">To</a>  put Jersey barriers and block off business is not helpful to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4048.951s">I</a>  mean, to close down a business seems really absurd to me and it's sad that <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4055.026s">you</a>  know, the council had to have DOT here and then notify department heads to, hey, why don't you email them so you can get updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4062.208s">DOT</a>  should be, get people from City Hall involved, and if not, we need to do it ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4068.069s">We</a>  need to have somebody in City Hall get involved and figure out what the concerns and questions are and get some, you know, resolve to our issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4080.513s">It's</a>  unbelievable.</p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4082.721s">There's</a>  the lack of signage in direction for people down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4086.482s">It's,</a>  it's really unbelievable. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4090.444s">There</a>  is no direction for people to go in. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4092.845s">They</a>  park certain places. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4095.145s">They</a>  don't know where the crosswalks are. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4097.546s">They</a>  don't know what's open, what isn't, you know, it is just, it's a serious problem.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4105.529s">I</a>  know, you know, and I think <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4109.129s">Something</a>  that's been clear, if I just may, from the chair, speak briefly. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4114.672s">Something</a>  that's been made clear to the new administration and part of some of the transition talks is a need for communication and a need for a point person on projects and issues like you're facing, Laurie. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4128.681s">Because</a>  you shouldn't be put through this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4133.864s">And</a>  no one should. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4135.405s">And</a>  we support you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4139.008s">I</a>  know you always have, and I appreciate you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4141.169s">And</a>  we'll continue to move on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4142.53s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4143.21s">So</a>  on the motion for approval by Councilor Gabriello.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4697.497s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4698.357s">I,</a>  you know, the city of Malden has a great part of their council agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4707.76s">We</a>  have public participation, which is under the rules and regulations of our city agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4713.962s">And</a>  the city of Malden does something pretty unique. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4716.143s">And</a>  I'm just throwing out as a potential suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4719.664s">They</a>  have prior to their regularly scheduled <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4722.175s">City</a>  Council meetings, a public forum meeting where every elected official on the council shows up. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4729.619s">And</a>  it's a public forum where residents get up, talk on any and every subject they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4736.842s">There's</a>  really, they have a time limit, but it's, from what I've been told, it's not really adhered to. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4742.485s">And</a>  it's just a great way of listening to, as we know what's going on tonight, there's a big meeting on constituent services and how do we best <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4750.795s">improve</a>  constituent services in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4753.276s">And</a>  much of that is to allow open public forums and debate and discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4757.717s">And,</a>  you know, maybe this particular meeting, Mr. President, which I appreciate your role as council president, has to be run in a way that we do the people's business and move on from issue to issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4769.719s">It</a>  can't be bogged down with the daily business of hearing things. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4774.141s">But</a>  maybe a forum like that, even if we did it once a month, to have a meeting prior to our meeting, <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4781.0s">that's</a>  open to the public and they can come up and address the council on anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4784.981s">They</a>  don't have to attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4786.421s">Cause</a>  right now to be on public participation, you got to contact the city clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4790.642s">You</a>  have to write out what your intent is, what you'd like to speak on. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4794.022s">And</a>  maybe if we hold a forum like that, you know, talk about opening up the lines of communication between city government and the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4802.584s">That</a>  may be an option, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4804.784s">And</a>  I think maybe residents, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4808.005s">You</a>  know, there's no two, we don't have to turn the TV on. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4810.106s">Some</a>  people don't like to get up to the podium because they don't want to be on TV and they don't, uh, afraid of speaking in front of a lot of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4816.027s">And</a>  so this might be a great suggestion, uh, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4819.469s">And,</a>  uh, maybe when we review our council rules, uh, we can review that also.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4891.424s">You</a>  are correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4892.805s">I</a>  did talk to the solicitor today.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4894.465s">So</a>  if we could just get a written opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4895.945s">I</a>  know I'm one that would like the public to be able to speak, but when it has to do with a no confidence vote, that's very serious. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4903.867s">I</a>  believe we've only had that happen one other time in my 14 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=4908.169s">So</a>  I really would like to get an opinion from the solicitor.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=5113.499s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=5114.1s">Thank</a>  you for your help. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=5115.46s">Congratulations.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=5115.98s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Castagnetti. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=5118.721s">The</a>  records. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=5121.491s">of</a>  the December 22nd, 2015 meeting were passed to Councilor Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=5125.834s">Madam</a>  Vice President, how do you find those records? <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=5130.577s">On</a>  the motion for approval by Councilor Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=5133.659s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=5135.08s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=5136.201s">Motion</a>  carries. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=5137.782s">Motion</a>  to adjourn.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=5142.248s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=5142.668s">Uh,</a>  and, uh, the clerk at Finn was nice enough to forward, uh, recently, uh, uh, correspondence from, uh, governor Baker regarding a number of potential amendments, uh, to mass general law that would impact local cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=5159.62s">And</a>  there had to be 40, 50 pages of potential amendments. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=5164.153s">And</a>  I just happened to go through some. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=5166.054s">Some</a>  I agreed with. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=5166.935s">Some</a>  I think need more discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=5169.037s">Some</a>  I didn't agree with. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=5170.317s">But</a>  I think it's appropriate that this body, at some point — these have not been enacted, but maybe as a body we should look at some of these and see which ones we would like to pursue and push forward, because there are many valid issues in there regarding election law, regarding the Treasurer-Collector's Office, regarding the city charter and the operation of how cities work and run. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=5194.23s">And</a>  it may be worthwhile that we have a committee of the whole meeting or a subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=5198.133s">I'm</a>  amenable to anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=5200.255s">But</a>  I think it's worthwhile because a lot of emphasis was put in it by the governor and his staff and based on countless recommendations from this entire commonwealth on how to streamline and improve city government. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=5216.228s">And</a>  I think it would be worthwhile, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=5218.63s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=5219.951s">So</a>  we will work on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=5222.273s">And</a>  we will give ourselves all a chance to look at those regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=5228.178s">And</a>  then we'll call the Committee of the Whole and maybe discuss it broadly. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=5232.041s">And</a>  then there, decide on how we want to, once we've had a chance to look at everything, perhaps decide how to move further from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=5241.009s">So</a>  on the motion for adjournment, by Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=5246.674s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=5247.795s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=5248.936s">Meeting</a>  is adjourned. <a href="https://youtu.be/kz27nkwTz-I&t=5249.716s">Thank</a>  you all.</p>
