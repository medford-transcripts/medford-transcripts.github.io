98
00:11:56,183 --> 00:11:56,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

99
00:11:57,143 --> 00:12:08,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, Mr. President, you know, um, in light of last week's storm, um, our leaking roof at the public library, which has been leaking for some time now is, uh, obviously been getting worse.

100
00:12:09,246 --> 00:12:14,608
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, if he, if you've seen the pictures that are out there, you see there's barrels all over the place and, um,

101
00:12:15,755 --> 00:12:21,459
[SPEAKER_06]: And I say that there's potential damage to a lot of the books, especially in the children's section.

102
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:32,907
[SPEAKER_06]: And we also have in our message from one of the members of the library, they went out and sought their own estimate for the roof.

103
00:12:33,748 --> 00:12:35,329
[SPEAKER_06]: And it ranges somewhere from $5,000 to $600,000.

104
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,111
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would like our head of maintenance

105
00:12:43,631 --> 00:12:51,434
[SPEAKER_06]: to give us a report on where we stand with fixing that roof and where we're going to go with it.

106
00:12:52,014 --> 00:13:10,981
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't too long ago that Mayor McGlynn was able to find some funding for the library before, and I would hope that our new mayor can maybe find some funds from the reserve's account to

107
00:13:12,085 --> 00:13:14,325
[SPEAKER_06]: get this roof repaired properly, Mr. President.

108
00:13:15,526 --> 00:13:24,568
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we could ask the head of maintenance for a report, maybe to come next week to explain to us what his- The building commissioner?

109
00:13:25,008 --> 00:13:31,589
[SPEAKER_06]: The building commissioner or the head of maintenance for the buildings on what his assessment of the roof situation is and where we're going with it.

110
00:13:32,009 --> 00:13:38,610
[SPEAKER_06]: And also a motion to the mayor to maybe take some money out of the reserve funds to get this done on a quick basis.

111
00:13:39,511 --> 00:13:39,871
[SPEAKER_11]: Very good.

112
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:41,231
[SPEAKER_11]: Before the next storm comes.

113
00:13:41,678 --> 00:13:45,840
[SPEAKER_11]: So, on the motion of Councilor Caraviello, as amended by Councilor Caraviello, Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

114
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,521
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

115
00:13:47,781 --> 00:13:53,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Before I just comment on it, I know that we have the Assistant Director here and a couple librarians, I believe.

116
00:13:54,804 --> 00:14:05,369
[SPEAKER_07]: If we could get an update, I had emailed with Assistant Director Kerr today, and there are some updates in addition, I think, to what Councilor Caraviello brought forward.

117
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:09,751
[SPEAKER_07]: So, if you could maybe enlighten us and explain to the public, because even when

118
00:14:10,335 --> 00:14:13,197
[SPEAKER_07]: I would email people back and say it's being worked on.

119
00:14:13,217 --> 00:14:14,998
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's kind of not enough.

120
00:14:15,118 --> 00:14:21,082
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, people want to make sure there's not just patches that are going to be done, that we are going to, you know, improve the roof so it doesn't happen again.

121
00:14:21,102 --> 00:14:21,422
[SPEAKER_07]: So, okay.

122
00:14:22,503 --> 00:14:22,983
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening.

123
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:24,564
[SPEAKER_11]: Please state your name and address for the record.

124
00:14:24,604 --> 00:14:28,107
[SPEAKER_08]: Barbara Kerr, 35 Baker Place, Newton, Massachusetts.

125
00:14:28,127 --> 00:14:30,428
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously.

126
00:14:30,448 --> 00:14:32,910
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, shall I start at the beginning or what?

127
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:34,091
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have specific questions?

128
00:14:34,991 --> 00:14:39,014
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I think, uh, uh, if you have some more news up to where,

129
00:14:39,548 --> 00:14:42,170
[SPEAKER_08]: We had that, I sent you guys that report.

130
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:43,731
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw the report that you sent.

131
00:14:43,911 --> 00:14:48,934
[SPEAKER_08]: I called that company in December just to see what kind of, what we could expect for the winter.

132
00:14:49,314 --> 00:14:53,918
[SPEAKER_08]: The roof has been fairly good until the last three or four years and then fairly bad.

133
00:14:54,318 --> 00:14:59,001
[SPEAKER_08]: So the building commissioner came out, they took care of the problem last week.

134
00:14:59,121 --> 00:15:06,025
[SPEAKER_08]: So we are, we're dry at the moment, the drains are clear, they cleared the roof, they pumped out all of the water and took the ice off.

135
00:15:07,126 --> 00:15:09,887
[SPEAKER_08]: We won't know what will happen until it rains again, but for the moment, we're okay.

136
00:15:09,947 --> 00:15:17,250
[SPEAKER_08]: Tomorrow, Mr. Moki and a roofer are coming out to walk around and the roofer is gonna give him an estimate for patches to get us through the winter.

137
00:15:18,031 --> 00:15:25,133
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I think in the spring, that report had three levels of repair, serious repair, and replacement.

138
00:15:25,193 --> 00:15:29,775
[SPEAKER_08]: So after he gets us through the winter, then we'll discuss what happens in the future.

139
00:15:30,936 --> 00:15:33,217
[SPEAKER_08]: So the roof is about, it was put in in the late 90s,

140
00:15:34,946 --> 00:15:35,746
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been pretty good.

141
00:15:35,906 --> 00:15:48,172
[SPEAKER_08]: They put it over skylights, so under some weird weather conditions, we would have leaks occasionally, but the last few years is the first time that we're having leaks really in the stack area, and the children's department, the first time was last year.

142
00:15:49,489 --> 00:15:52,270
[SPEAKER_07]: And I believe you had mentioned that 100 books were ruined.

143
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:52,650
[SPEAKER_07]: 100 books, yeah.

144
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:53,051
[SPEAKER_07]: 100 books were ruined.

145
00:15:53,071 --> 00:15:59,474
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been very fortunate in that we're good at it now, so that when the ceiling tiles begin to get wet, they bow.

146
00:16:00,034 --> 00:16:03,155
[SPEAKER_08]: So we take them down and drain the water out.

147
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:09,098
[SPEAKER_08]: So unless they come down in the night and the water comes down in the night, we've been good at catching it before there was any damage.

148
00:16:09,178 --> 00:16:10,899
[SPEAKER_08]: But this time we didn't.

149
00:16:10,999 --> 00:16:12,379
[SPEAKER_08]: And we didn't once last year as well.

150
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:13,980
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're a little concerned.

151
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,541
[SPEAKER_08]: We are good at the ceiling tiles.

152
00:16:15,561 --> 00:16:17,202
[SPEAKER_08]: But if one happened to fall and we didn't notice,

153
00:16:18,982 --> 00:16:21,583
[SPEAKER_08]: a problem with people if someone's walking underneath it at the time.

154
00:16:21,643 --> 00:16:25,243
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully the custodians are pro at spotting the wet ones.

155
00:16:27,464 --> 00:16:29,024
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

156
00:16:29,844 --> 00:16:40,967
[SPEAKER_07]: If I may, whether the patching is enough for the winter, I don't feel like patchwork at the library in the long term is going to be beneficial for the library.

157
00:16:40,987 --> 00:16:47,368
[SPEAKER_07]: So I really hope the administration decides what we're going to do with the arts and the library and the Chevalier.

158
00:16:47,792 --> 00:16:59,578
[SPEAKER_07]: create a plan, and if we are—whether or not we're going to build on top of the library, which has been discussed, that we permanently fix the problem in the spring, if that's what the administration decides.

159
00:16:59,939 --> 00:17:04,461
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think a new roof is probably needed, especially in that section, and that's what should be done.

160
00:17:05,421 --> 00:17:15,587
[SPEAKER_07]: Since the library—I think 10 emails have come in with concerned parents and concerned people who frequent the library, that that's just something that, you know, should not happen, and it should be immediately fixed.

161
00:17:16,047 --> 00:17:21,091
[SPEAKER_07]: Since then, I've also got complaints about roof leaking at the high school, the Volk.

162
00:17:21,631 --> 00:17:25,254
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm probably sure Councilor Marks will discuss the gym leaking.

163
00:17:25,274 --> 00:17:27,636
[SPEAKER_07]: There's barrels out in the gym.

164
00:17:27,876 --> 00:17:38,844
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think maybe if our administration would be amenable, we should evaluate all of our city built, the roofs of every single city and school building, just to make sure.

165
00:17:38,884 --> 00:17:41,186
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, the Columbus School, I was complaining about that roof.

166
00:17:41,762 --> 00:17:48,125
[SPEAKER_07]: last year and it wasn't until residents and the council and probably the school committee complained about it, that that was fixed.

167
00:17:48,205 --> 00:17:49,686
[SPEAKER_07]: It took too long.

168
00:17:50,146 --> 00:17:51,287
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that's the problem.

169
00:17:51,327 --> 00:17:58,171
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we have money to do other things in the city, hire new positions and things like that, I think we should have money to maintain our roofs.

170
00:17:59,091 --> 00:18:06,155
[SPEAKER_11]: It was amended by Councilor, Vice President Lungo-Koehn that an assessment be done of the maintenance and repair needs of all municipal buildings.

171
00:18:06,571 --> 00:18:13,273
[SPEAKER_07]: The worse your roofs get, the worse public property gets damaged, the worse the building inside is going to get.

172
00:18:13,313 --> 00:18:16,254
[SPEAKER_07]: And it just creates a chain reaction.

173
00:18:16,274 --> 00:18:19,995
[SPEAKER_07]: And this council has spoken up a number of times about a maintenance budget.

174
00:18:20,355 --> 00:18:22,756
[SPEAKER_07]: We should have a maintenance budget in the city and school side.

175
00:18:23,056 --> 00:18:24,537
[SPEAKER_07]: And roofs should be the top priority.

176
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:27,698
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

177
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:30,519
[SPEAKER_11]: Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

178
00:18:31,219 --> 00:18:32,479
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

179
00:18:32,499 --> 00:18:33,339
[SPEAKER_10]: And thank you, Ms.

180
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:35,020
[SPEAKER_10]: Clark, for such a thorough presentation.

181
00:18:36,076 --> 00:18:39,238
[SPEAKER_10]: As we're all aware, the money bills come from the administration.

182
00:18:39,778 --> 00:18:49,002
[SPEAKER_10]: And at Sunday's inaugural ceremony, Mayor Burke expressed such a desire to establish a five-year capital plan that I think, you know, timing's great.

183
00:18:49,022 --> 00:18:50,443
[SPEAKER_10]: We're really striking when the iron's hot.

184
00:18:50,923 --> 00:18:53,564
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that it's very important that those concerned

185
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:58,255
[SPEAKER_10]: with the maintenance needs at the library, be sure to attend Monday's meeting.

186
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:01,157
[SPEAKER_10]: Monday, the 11th at 7 p.m.

187
00:19:01,197 --> 00:19:08,143
[SPEAKER_10]: at the Medford Arts Council, the Burke Transition Team's Cultural Affairs and Recreation Committee is scheduled to meet at 7 p.m.

188
00:19:08,864 --> 00:19:15,310
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't think that there's anything more significant in terms of cultural affairs than our library, Mr. President.

189
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:18,953
[SPEAKER_10]: So I feel as though it will be very important for those residents out there that do have a concern and do have

190
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,823
[SPEAKER_10]: a desire to see more funding at our public library to participate in these meetings as well as they come forward.

191
00:19:25,324 --> 00:19:27,665
[SPEAKER_10]: I certainly support a five-year capital plan.

192
00:19:27,725 --> 00:19:30,387
[SPEAKER_10]: I certainly support a maintenance plan for our buildings, Mr. President.

193
00:19:30,407 --> 00:19:34,190
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's something that all of us behind this rail have been preaching for a number of months.

194
00:19:34,922 --> 00:19:47,968
[SPEAKER_10]: With that being said, Mr. President, I just wanted to be sure that everybody was aware that the transition team will be meeting on Monday, a week from yesterday, at the Medford Heights Council Space at the Meadow Glen Mall to discuss issues like this and what we're gonna do moving forward.

195
00:19:47,988 --> 00:19:55,291
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think it's a welcome breath of fresh air to have an opportunity to come to a meeting like this, a community meeting, Mr. President, and I'm looking forward to it.

196
00:19:55,951 --> 00:19:57,232
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much, Councilor Neitzel.

197
00:19:57,252 --> 00:20:04,275
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion of approval on the resolution by Councilor Caraviello, as amended by Councilors Caraviello,

198
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:09,348
[SPEAKER_11]: and Lungo-Koehn share recognizes for the first time, Councilor Falco.

199
00:20:09,588 --> 00:20:11,670
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Dello Russo, and thank you, Ms.

200
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:12,430
[SPEAKER_18]: Kerr, for your report.

201
00:20:14,572 --> 00:20:19,715
[SPEAKER_18]: When I got the report, I read over the report, and it is troubling to see some of the issues with the roof.

202
00:20:20,456 --> 00:20:28,321
[SPEAKER_18]: And I definitely support fixing the roof, but I'd like to actually see if we can amend, actually, the original resolution.

203
00:20:28,862 --> 00:20:33,525
[SPEAKER_18]: And what I'd like to see is, I would like to see a comprehensive review

204
00:20:34,496 --> 00:20:37,537
[SPEAKER_18]: of the library, not only just the roof, but the entire building.

205
00:20:38,478 --> 00:20:46,781
[SPEAKER_18]: I would like to see a report come to the council, a comprehensive review of everything, the structure of the building, which I'm sure it's safe and I'm sure it's sound.

206
00:20:46,801 --> 00:20:48,981
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not an engineer, but I'd like to see that.

207
00:20:49,362 --> 00:20:50,222
[SPEAKER_18]: How old is the furnace?

208
00:20:50,562 --> 00:20:54,223
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, basically a whole review of the entire building.

209
00:20:55,544 --> 00:20:58,685
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I know we recently, we had the bathrooms fixed, I believe recently.

210
00:20:59,456 --> 00:21:02,637
[SPEAKER_18]: But I think we should look at everything from the bathrooms to the elevator to the roof.

211
00:21:02,917 --> 00:21:04,377
[SPEAKER_18]: We should look at the whole entire building.

212
00:21:04,417 --> 00:21:07,698
[SPEAKER_18]: We have to think about the future, the future of this building.

213
00:21:07,738 --> 00:21:10,339
[SPEAKER_18]: This building is, I think, at least 60 years old.

214
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:11,879
[SPEAKER_18]: We need to look at the future.

215
00:21:11,899 --> 00:21:13,059
[SPEAKER_18]: This is a community asset.

216
00:21:13,099 --> 00:21:14,920
[SPEAKER_18]: This is an important asset that we have.

217
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,920
[SPEAKER_18]: It's used by the youth.

218
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,781
[SPEAKER_18]: It's used by the seniors.

219
00:21:17,801 --> 00:21:18,781
[SPEAKER_18]: It's used by everyone.

220
00:21:19,081 --> 00:21:21,462
[SPEAKER_18]: And we really need to take a look at this.

221
00:21:21,502 --> 00:21:26,943
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'd like to see if we can amend that to get a whole comprehensive review of the library structure.

222
00:21:29,047 --> 00:21:29,427
[SPEAKER_11]: Very good.

223
00:21:29,567 --> 00:21:37,093
[SPEAKER_11]: So as, uh, on the motion of Councilor Caraviello, as amended by Councilor, uh, Falco, uh, chair recognizes councilor Caraviello.

224
00:21:37,453 --> 00:21:38,094
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

225
00:21:38,394 --> 00:21:38,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Barbara.

226
00:21:38,854 --> 00:21:39,214
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

227
00:21:39,334 --> 00:21:47,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I mean, in my four years on the council, I've gone to the mass municipal association show every year and every year they have the library building fund there.

228
00:21:48,121 --> 00:21:51,503
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've asked every year if Medford has applied for funds for it.

229
00:21:51,963 --> 00:21:58,448
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was told every year, no, I mean, um, is that, I don't know if that fund is still going to be available this year, but the show was good.

230
00:21:58,863 --> 00:22:00,886
[SPEAKER_06]: But the master show is in a couple of weeks.

231
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:02,327
[SPEAKER_06]: I intend to attend there.

232
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:05,131
[SPEAKER_06]: And I said, if the library building fund is there.

233
00:22:05,151 --> 00:22:08,095
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that the state?

234
00:22:08,155 --> 00:22:10,257
[SPEAKER_06]: The state, yes.

235
00:22:10,277 --> 00:22:12,320
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it was the state building for libraries.

236
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:15,524
[SPEAKER_06]: And every year when I go there, I go up to the booth there and I ask.

237
00:22:15,984 --> 00:22:17,827
[SPEAKER_06]: And they said, we've never applied for funds.

238
00:22:20,343 --> 00:22:23,005
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, what do we do?

239
00:22:23,565 --> 00:22:33,393
[SPEAKER_08]: I know we were not eligible for library commissioners construction funds until we submitted a strategic plan last year.

240
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:38,998
[SPEAKER_08]: So we are now, we are now, but I'm not sure if that's the same thing.

241
00:22:39,138 --> 00:22:40,579
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm curious to see what that is.

242
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:40,959
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure.

243
00:22:40,979 --> 00:22:44,062
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a library building fund that was there and they, they gave money.

244
00:22:44,482 --> 00:22:47,745
[SPEAKER_06]: They had money in grants for rebuilding and putting up new libraries.

245
00:22:48,543 --> 00:22:49,383
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that might be interesting.

246
00:22:49,444 --> 00:22:58,169
[SPEAKER_08]: The one, as I understand it, if you want me to do the outline, the Board of Library Commissioners releases grant funding sporadically these days.

247
00:22:58,209 --> 00:22:59,349
[SPEAKER_08]: It used to be every five years.

248
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:01,451
[SPEAKER_08]: The last time was 2010.

249
00:23:01,971 --> 00:23:06,334
[SPEAKER_08]: They're anticipating 2020, which we would not be ready for for a number of reasons.

250
00:23:07,334 --> 00:23:11,577
[SPEAKER_08]: If they did it in 2025 or 2030, we would be ready to apply.

251
00:23:11,677 --> 00:23:13,278
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm not sure if that's a separate thing.

252
00:23:13,398 --> 00:23:14,618
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well, I think the show was on the 20th or the 21st.

253
00:23:18,011 --> 00:23:20,833
[SPEAKER_06]: of January at the Sheridan in Boston.

254
00:23:20,913 --> 00:23:22,574
[SPEAKER_06]: I plan to attend again.

255
00:23:23,074 --> 00:23:28,958
[SPEAKER_06]: And if they're there, I'm going to hopefully get some more literature and maybe we can help get some help in there.

256
00:23:28,978 --> 00:23:31,179
[SPEAKER_08]: Because that's possibly a whole different source of funding.

257
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,641
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not something I'm aware of if it's a different thing.

258
00:23:33,661 --> 00:23:34,782
[SPEAKER_08]: So hey, why not?

259
00:23:35,982 --> 00:23:39,284
[SPEAKER_06]: And as Councilor Falco mentioned, we spent the money on the bathroom.

260
00:23:40,325 --> 00:23:42,887
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think the money was very well spent on the bathroom.

261
00:23:43,067 --> 00:23:44,568
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to do some better homes and gardens on it.

262
00:23:44,588 --> 00:23:45,428
[SPEAKER_06]: I was in there last week.

263
00:23:48,957 --> 00:23:57,422
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, I don't know where that money was spent that we, that was appropriate for it.

264
00:23:58,382 --> 00:24:02,925
[SPEAKER_06]: That didn't look like, uh, that amount of money had spent.

265
00:24:02,945 --> 00:24:08,168
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to try again when I go to the show next week, I'll see, I'll see what's there again.

266
00:24:08,788 --> 00:24:09,629
[SPEAKER_08]: That might be different.

267
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:10,589
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be good.

268
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:12,070
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

269
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:12,950
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Caraviello.

270
00:24:13,311 --> 00:24:15,552
[SPEAKER_11]: Chair recognizes for the first time,

271
00:24:16,347 --> 00:24:17,167
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Scarpelli.

272
00:24:18,047 --> 00:24:19,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

273
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:45,552
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's important that we've discussed this and try to find a way to add this to the amendment, but look into, um, uh, and I thinking outside the box and looking at, you know, when you're talking about a roof and you're talking about bathrooms, when we're talking about the library infrastructure, how bad or how good it is, I'd like to see with that report is to also investigate, you know, other facilities within our community and see if there's ways that we can,

274
00:24:46,182 --> 00:24:48,743
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, use different buildings.

275
00:24:48,783 --> 00:24:49,663
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll give an example.

276
00:24:50,203 --> 00:25:13,852
[SPEAKER_05]: If we look right next door to Springstep and said, if there's square footage there to put both a library and an arts center and use that to bring everything here with the infrastructure strong and new and updated, and then look at the land that has the library and look to sell that land off to a developer, I think that's something that I'd like to

277
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:33,496
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, entertain as we go forward that when you're talking about big, big money, uh, and you talk about how, how we, we reinvested into the schools and we built the so-called new schools and how we moved forward with that thinking outside the box and, and really looking to bring a library to the 21st century.

278
00:25:33,516 --> 00:25:34,257
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's important.

279
00:25:34,997 --> 00:25:36,658
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so thank you.

280
00:25:36,858 --> 00:25:37,178
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

281
00:25:37,418 --> 00:25:44,142
[SPEAKER_11]: So as amended, uh, by councilor Scappelli that the, uh, review of the, uh, uh, buildings use, uh,

282
00:25:44,784 --> 00:25:55,406
[SPEAKER_11]: also encompass, uh, additional land use and, uh, alternative land use, uh, for the, uh, library building itself.

283
00:25:57,207 --> 00:25:58,807
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

284
00:26:00,147 --> 00:26:00,927
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. President.

285
00:26:00,947 --> 00:26:13,810
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to thank councilor Caraviello for putting this on the agenda and for Barbara sending us the report that was commissioned by the public library, uh, to, uh, take a look at the roof.

286
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:19,273
[SPEAKER_20]: and the current condition and what needs to take place in order to bring that roof up to code.

287
00:26:20,093 --> 00:26:31,940
[SPEAKER_20]: And to me, much of what has taken place over the last several years, from what I can gather from the report, is the report is not allowing proper drainage.

288
00:26:32,781 --> 00:26:41,145
[SPEAKER_20]: And many of the drains up on the roof aren't in proper location to catch the water that's draining.

289
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,667
[SPEAKER_20]: The water's not draining to that location

290
00:26:44,272 --> 00:26:48,675
[SPEAKER_20]: And much of it seems to me just a lack of just small maintenance.

291
00:26:49,195 --> 00:26:54,398
[SPEAKER_20]: Someone would go up in the roof and take a broom and sweep the debris around the drains.

292
00:26:54,919 --> 00:26:57,080
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, I do that in my home on my gutters.

293
00:26:57,941 --> 00:27:00,122
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's just basic maintenance.

294
00:27:00,662 --> 00:27:11,209
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think a lot of the pooling that we see up on the roof from the pitches would be prevented just based on simple, simple maintenance that could be done.

295
00:27:13,605 --> 00:27:24,971
[SPEAKER_20]: The report talked about standing water, which I think some of it could be accomplished through the re-sloping and pitching of some areas, the top roof and the lower roof.

296
00:27:25,751 --> 00:27:29,914
[SPEAKER_20]: And it also talked about mortar around the windows and around the sunlights.

297
00:27:30,974 --> 00:27:38,898
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's just basic maintenance, because if you have mortar, as we know, the last time the roof was replaced was in 1990.

298
00:27:38,958 --> 00:27:40,139
[SPEAKER_20]: That's 25 years.

299
00:27:42,675 --> 00:27:44,516
[SPEAKER_20]: that's what the report said, 1990.

300
00:27:44,656 --> 00:27:47,457
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, so that's 25 years.

301
00:27:48,138 --> 00:28:04,405
[SPEAKER_20]: And, um, you know, any, any roof, uh, although you would hope you'd get 25 to 30 years, especially in a commercial type setting, uh, you need to have that maintenance over time, which as we know, the public library over the last several years has been severely underfunded.

302
00:28:05,265 --> 00:28:08,427
[SPEAKER_20]: And, uh, we're seeing that through lack of positions in the library,

303
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:16,383
[SPEAKER_20]: And maintenance, as we know throughout the whole system, we see our roof's been leaking here at City Hall for many years.

304
00:28:16,803 --> 00:28:27,506
[SPEAKER_20]: I attended an event at the high school gymnasium cages, and there had to be 12 or 13 barrels set up strategically catching water from leaks in the ceiling.

305
00:28:28,386 --> 00:28:35,007
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, you go into the police department, the evidence room has been leaking for years, Mr. President.

306
00:28:35,728 --> 00:28:37,648
[SPEAKER_20]: The fire stations, we have many concerns.

307
00:28:38,381 --> 00:28:39,442
[SPEAKER_20]: in our fire station.

308
00:28:39,762 --> 00:28:47,205
[SPEAKER_20]: And this council is asked for because, you know, it's great to have Paul Moky, and we've discussed this with the building commissioner.

309
00:28:47,605 --> 00:28:48,786
[SPEAKER_20]: He is the building commissioner.

310
00:28:48,846 --> 00:28:56,649
[SPEAKER_20]: He's in charge of all the different heads down there, from code enforcement to plumbing to electrical inspectors.

311
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:02,592
[SPEAKER_20]: But he is not the building supervisor for all the public buildings.

312
00:29:03,072 --> 00:29:04,493
[SPEAKER_20]: He's not the supervisor.

313
00:29:04,893 --> 00:29:07,434
[SPEAKER_20]: And as was mentioned, I think Barbara mentioned it,

314
00:29:07,848 --> 00:29:18,834
[SPEAKER_20]: that when there were leaks in the building over the last couple of years, no one ever thought to call Paul Mokey up because it's never been that way in the city.

315
00:29:19,115 --> 00:29:21,476
[SPEAKER_20]: Paul doesn't go out and inspect our buildings.

316
00:29:22,076 --> 00:29:28,400
[SPEAKER_20]: And this council has asked for a buildings and grounds manager for several years now.

317
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:36,485
[SPEAKER_20]: Someone that would be in charge of all the municipal buildings to make sure there's a maintenance budget in place, to make sure the small preventative items

318
00:29:37,018 --> 00:29:38,759
[SPEAKER_20]: Like I said, someone to go up with a broom.

319
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,321
[SPEAKER_20]: That's doesn't take a lot.

320
00:29:40,761 --> 00:29:46,725
[SPEAKER_20]: It's sweep around the drains, uh, you know, very basic things, but there's, there's no oversight.

321
00:29:46,905 --> 00:29:48,907
[SPEAKER_20]: There's really a lack of oversight.

322
00:29:49,427 --> 00:29:56,232
[SPEAKER_20]: And you would think the public library is in a different country from a city hall, from the fire stations to the police department.

323
00:29:56,833 --> 00:29:58,694
[SPEAKER_20]: It's all like it's own little separate nations.

324
00:29:59,315 --> 00:30:06,340
[SPEAKER_20]: And, uh, really until we get this all under one umbrella, uh, in my opinion, a buildings and grounds manager would accomplish.

325
00:30:07,063 --> 00:30:09,644
[SPEAKER_20]: The public schools have a building and grounds manager.

326
00:30:10,464 --> 00:30:16,606
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm not saying they should or shouldn't have one, but they have someone that's in charge of overseeing the maintenance of all the buildings.

327
00:30:17,206 --> 00:30:20,648
[SPEAKER_20]: And in my opinion, that's needed on the city side, Mr. President.

328
00:30:21,028 --> 00:30:24,109
[SPEAKER_20]: We also talked about a long-term capital improvement plan.

329
00:30:24,449 --> 00:30:36,133
[SPEAKER_20]: I know the public library recently, within the last six months, Barbara, put together a proposal on what the vision is for the public library over the long-term vision.

330
00:30:36,875 --> 00:30:42,377
[SPEAKER_20]: And I, like many members behind this council, would like to see, uh, maybe the second floor expanded.

331
00:30:42,397 --> 00:30:50,099
[SPEAKER_20]: Uh, I think, uh, in my opinion, from what I heard from, uh, people in the know in the community is the, the building is structurally sound.

332
00:30:50,919 --> 00:30:53,200
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, and the footprint itself is probably workable.

333
00:30:53,600 --> 00:31:04,283
[SPEAKER_20]: The second floor has room for expansion and, um, you know, I'd, I'd like to see work take place on the roof, but I'd like to see an overall picture as was mentioned by some of the members of the council.

334
00:31:04,623 --> 00:31:05,323
[SPEAKER_20]: What's our vision?

335
00:31:06,028 --> 00:31:07,029
[SPEAKER_20]: of the public library?

336
00:31:07,309 --> 00:31:10,771
[SPEAKER_20]: Can we envision maybe a mixed use?

337
00:31:11,111 --> 00:31:26,198
[SPEAKER_20]: Could we see maybe adding a little cafe in the public library where people can go and have a cup of coffee in Danish or something like that and also have use of the library or maybe involve more of a community space in the public library?

338
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:29,740
[SPEAKER_20]: I know we have a community space there now, but maybe enhance that.

339
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:33,742
[SPEAKER_20]: So these are the things I think, Mr. President, that we have to look at because

340
00:31:34,428 --> 00:31:54,322
[SPEAKER_20]: If you look at each of the estimate ranges regarding repair, retrofit and replacement of the roof, and it breaks it down from the canopy, which is that exterior strip around the library to the high roof, which is the second level to the lower roof repair.

341
00:31:54,362 --> 00:32:00,927
[SPEAKER_20]: If we were just going to look at repair to accomplish the leaks that we have right now, solve the leaks you're looking at about

342
00:32:01,576 --> 00:32:03,437
[SPEAKER_20]: mid-range of the estimates, about $15,000.

343
00:32:03,917 --> 00:32:07,559
[SPEAKER_20]: That's just to accomplish what we have for leaks.

344
00:32:08,099 --> 00:32:25,187
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, if you wanted a retrofit and do more of a long-term fix, like some of the flashing on the roof, fix some of the mortar, some of the skylights that need to be replaced, and so forth, you're looking at, to retrofit, and this would be the canopy, the high roof, and the low roof, about $108,000.

345
00:32:25,747 --> 00:32:29,969
[SPEAKER_20]: And then to do a total replacement, according to the estimates,

346
00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:32,357
[SPEAKER_20]: And this is just the middle of the estimate.

347
00:32:32,837 --> 00:32:36,599
[SPEAKER_20]: It's like Councilor Caraviello mentioned, it's closer to 600,000.

348
00:32:37,239 --> 00:32:59,150
[SPEAKER_20]: So as you can see, there's a great disparity among what, you know, if the city just wants to accomplish a quick fix, 15,000, I'm sure we can find that in some account, or if they want to look at a long-term approach, which according to the report would extend, if we looked at the retrofit and replacement, you're looking at an extension of,

349
00:32:59,794 --> 00:33:01,375
[SPEAKER_20]: a life in the roof for 30 years.

350
00:33:02,075 --> 00:33:04,296
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think these are the things that we have to consider.

351
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:15,441
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, and also, uh, what, uh, we'd like to see, uh, I like, uh, councilor Scarpelli's idea, you know, thinking outside the box, I'll refresh it.

352
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:20,463
[SPEAKER_20]: Uh, because we've mentioned that building for a potential police department.

353
00:33:20,703 --> 00:33:22,383
[SPEAKER_20]: We've mentioned it for a public library.

354
00:33:22,604 --> 00:33:23,924
[SPEAKER_20]: We've mentioned it for an art center.

355
00:33:24,324 --> 00:33:25,025
[SPEAKER_20]: And I agree with you.

356
00:33:25,045 --> 00:33:26,545
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a stone throw from city hall.

357
00:33:27,045 --> 00:33:28,366
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a beautiful facade.

358
00:33:29,277 --> 00:33:31,979
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think we can work that building into whatever we need to do.

359
00:33:32,539 --> 00:33:34,480
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think that's a great suggestion.

360
00:33:35,041 --> 00:33:41,184
[SPEAKER_20]: And hopefully, with this new administration, we'll be able to experience some thinking outside the box.

361
00:33:41,804 --> 00:33:56,453
[SPEAKER_20]: But I just want to make, Mr. President, a recommendation that, once again, this council go on record asking that a building grounds manager be hired to oversee all of our

362
00:33:57,474 --> 00:34:10,419
[SPEAKER_20]: municipal buildings in the community, and that any long-term plan, I know in the Mayor Burke's inaugural, she mentioned in her speech a long-term capital improvement plan.

363
00:34:10,859 --> 00:34:18,162
[SPEAKER_20]: I would hope the library, which I'm sure is included in that, also has a particular item for maintenance.

364
00:34:19,102 --> 00:34:26,525
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think it was Councilor Penta for the last 10 years, he's talked about a lot of things, but one thing he did talk about which made a lot of sense

365
00:34:26,955 --> 00:34:34,120
[SPEAKER_20]: was, in our budget process, to have at least 3 to 5 percent allocated for maintenance within the budget.

366
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,143
[SPEAKER_20]: And I know it's probably the first cost that you say, well, times are tough.

367
00:34:38,163 --> 00:34:41,345
[SPEAKER_20]: We can do away with that particular maintenance cost.

368
00:34:42,026 --> 00:34:45,608
[SPEAKER_20]: But it really pays itself tenfold when you keep after your property.

369
00:34:45,989 --> 00:34:47,730
[SPEAKER_20]: Any of us that are property owners know that.

370
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:53,354
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think we're bearing the fruit of neglect for so many years now.

371
00:34:55,657 --> 00:34:59,078
[SPEAKER_20]: what's taking place after neglect and lack of maintenance.

372
00:34:59,118 --> 00:35:01,979
[SPEAKER_20]: So, I would offer those recommendations, Mr. President.

373
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:15,843
[SPEAKER_20]: Buildings Ground Manager, a long-term capital improvement plan issued by this city, and also a legitimate — I sat in the budget hearings with the former director of the library.

374
00:35:16,783 --> 00:35:24,045
[SPEAKER_20]: And as you just mentioned, the library didn't have a problem with leaks for many years, but in the last four or five years, there were problems.

375
00:35:24,841 --> 00:35:38,706
[SPEAKER_20]: And unless my hearing was bad during our budget deliberations, I have never once heard the director, with all due respect to the former director, mention anything about the concern of leaks in the public library.

376
00:35:39,306 --> 00:35:50,190
[SPEAKER_20]: And that concerns me, because I'm sure someone that spends eight to 10 hours a day there, five days a week, would know better off what's going on in the building and the needs.

377
00:35:51,211 --> 00:35:54,392
[SPEAKER_20]: So those are my comments, Mr. President.

378
00:35:54,798 --> 00:36:06,926
[SPEAKER_20]: And if I could just comment on Councilor Caraviello, because it was my recommendation back three years ago to allocate $10,000 to, uh, towards the restrooms at the public library.

379
00:36:07,386 --> 00:36:18,473
[SPEAKER_20]: I refer to them as prison bathrooms because in my opinion, when I went into the bathrooms, I've never been in prison, but I would assume they look like prison bathrooms.

380
00:36:19,414 --> 00:36:24,197
[SPEAKER_20]: And, uh, indeed the city administration, uh, agreed with my comments.

381
00:36:24,553 --> 00:36:32,695
[SPEAKER_20]: put $10,000 in the budget, and $10,000 worth of improvements were made to the women's and the men's restroom.

382
00:36:34,075 --> 00:36:39,177
[SPEAKER_20]: And a new buzzer system was put in, a new system, which wasn't adequately working at the time.

383
00:36:40,057 --> 00:36:45,578
[SPEAKER_20]: And I agree, it doesn't look like a lot was done, but many of the fixtures were changed in the bathrooms.

384
00:36:46,478 --> 00:36:49,979
[SPEAKER_20]: The changing table was fixed in the women's room.

385
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:52,760
[SPEAKER_20]: And the concern of privacy

386
00:36:53,722 --> 00:36:58,585
[SPEAKER_20]: because before you'd be buzzed in and someone could be in the woman's restroom, and there was a lot of issues around it.

387
00:36:59,005 --> 00:37:00,687
[SPEAKER_20]: But there was something done.

388
00:37:00,707 --> 00:37:08,731
[SPEAKER_20]: It wasn't up to my standard, but I have to say the administration did do something there, Mr. President, and a lot more is needed.

389
00:37:09,272 --> 00:37:09,652
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

390
00:37:10,192 --> 00:37:12,113
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Councilor Knox.

391
00:37:12,374 --> 00:37:13,714
[SPEAKER_10]: Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

392
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:19,358
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much, Mr. President, and thank you, Councilor Knox, because I think that that pretty much sums up the issue.

393
00:37:19,901 --> 00:37:22,402
[SPEAKER_10]: relatively well from start to finish, soup to nuts.

394
00:37:22,522 --> 00:37:27,544
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, I think that, um, you know, we're, we're looking at a building here that certainly needs a preventative maintenance plan.

395
00:37:27,564 --> 00:37:29,704
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a number of city buildings that need that.

396
00:37:30,245 --> 00:37:45,470
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, and as I sit here and I listened to, uh, the discussion about this issue, uh, I think back to, uh, recent weeks when we were at the library, many of us for a dedication of the reading room to the late Richard Lee and in attorney Romney's address.

397
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:49,571
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, he said something that really stood out to me and this discussion really

398
00:37:49,987 --> 00:37:57,761
[SPEAKER_10]: makes me think of it, Mr. President, it was that out of all the public buildings that we have in the city of Medford, the library is really the only one that people go to voluntarily.

399
00:38:00,721 --> 00:38:01,401
[SPEAKER_10]: You got to figure.

400
00:38:02,101 --> 00:38:03,822
[SPEAKER_10]: You come to City Hall to pay a tax bill.

401
00:38:03,902 --> 00:38:05,783
[SPEAKER_10]: You go to the police department to I don't know what.

402
00:38:08,183 --> 00:38:12,265
[SPEAKER_10]: But ultimately, the library is a building where people go for recreational purposes.

403
00:38:12,385 --> 00:38:18,506
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that the value of a strong public library has been minimized.

404
00:38:18,747 --> 00:38:22,728
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that we're on the right track right now, Mr. President, to really put together a strong plan.

405
00:38:23,308 --> 00:38:24,468
[SPEAKER_10]: However, it has to be a partnership.

406
00:38:24,548 --> 00:38:27,449
[SPEAKER_10]: It has to be a plan that the administration is going to buy into as well.

407
00:38:27,809 --> 00:38:29,390
[SPEAKER_10]: So I certainly think that

408
00:38:30,417 --> 00:38:37,642
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, it's a breath of fresh air to see this council come together and come up with some great solutions and great ideas as to how we'd like to see this move forward.

409
00:38:37,682 --> 00:38:40,224
[SPEAKER_10]: But ultimately, if it's a money bill, it's going to come from the administration.

410
00:38:40,264 --> 00:38:42,845
[SPEAKER_10]: So we need to work cooperatively with them, Mr. President.

411
00:38:42,865 --> 00:38:53,032
[SPEAKER_10]: So with that being said, I just really wanted to reflect a little bit on the fact that, you know, a public library is really the only building that people come into voluntarily in the city and they do it because it's a great place to bring your family.

412
00:38:53,052 --> 00:38:53,993
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a great place to,

413
00:38:54,339 --> 00:39:01,304
[SPEAKER_10]: relax, unwind, have some peace, some quiet, and trust me, I need a lot more of that lately than I have in the past, Mr. President, with the new baby in the house.

414
00:39:01,625 --> 00:39:04,367
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm very fortunate to live across the street from the library.

415
00:39:05,708 --> 00:39:08,830
[SPEAKER_10]: But with that being said, Mr. President, I move for approval on the paper.

416
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:10,411
[SPEAKER_10]: The President.

417
00:39:10,432 --> 00:39:10,732
[SPEAKER_11]: Very good.

418
00:39:10,932 --> 00:39:19,438
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion of approval on the paper of Councilor Caraviello, as amended by Councilors Caraviello, Lungo-Koehn, Falco, Scarpelli, and Marks.

419
00:39:19,539 --> 00:39:21,000
[SPEAKER_11]: Chair recognizes Councilor Caraviello.

420
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:21,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

421
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,962
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, Councilor Scarpelli brought up

422
00:39:24,332 --> 00:39:29,953
[SPEAKER_06]: Springsteep when I proposed that the city buy it some years ago, it was $2.1 million.

423
00:39:30,013 --> 00:39:33,514
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I understand it's close to $5 million for the building.

424
00:39:33,754 --> 00:39:38,035
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, I think if we, if we had jumped on it, then it would have been a steal.

425
00:39:38,655 --> 00:39:39,035
[SPEAKER_11]: Very good.

426
00:39:40,155 --> 00:39:40,555
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

427
00:39:40,575 --> 00:39:41,516
[SPEAKER_11]: Counsel Caraviello.

428
00:39:41,536 --> 00:39:44,556
[SPEAKER_11]: So on the motion of approval, we have a number of citizens wish to speak.

429
00:39:44,616 --> 00:39:44,796
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

430
00:39:44,816 --> 00:39:46,077
[SPEAKER_11]: Curt, do you wish to continue?

431
00:39:46,097 --> 00:39:51,298
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I just want to thank you all very much for your good work, your diligence and your advocacy.

432
00:39:51,558 --> 00:39:52,218
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

433
00:39:54,158 --> 00:39:56,200
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening, please state your name and address for the record.

434
00:39:57,822 --> 00:40:00,265
[SPEAKER_12]: Sarah Beardsley, 38 Warren Street in Medford.

435
00:40:01,186 --> 00:40:04,911
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wanted to correct a statement by Councilor Knight.

436
00:40:05,852 --> 00:40:13,741
[SPEAKER_12]: The Arts, Recreation and Culture meeting which is taking place on the 11th is at the Medford Arts Center.

437
00:40:14,522 --> 00:40:17,384
[SPEAKER_12]: Medford Arts Council is a totally different group.

438
00:40:18,725 --> 00:40:23,069
[SPEAKER_12]: And just for the record too, we're having another meeting also on the 20th of this month.

439
00:40:23,849 --> 00:40:27,012
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, unfortunately that will be our last meeting there.

440
00:40:27,692 --> 00:40:30,895
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, because Medford Arts Center has to look for a new home.

441
00:40:31,575 --> 00:40:33,417
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, and we're closing on the 31st.

442
00:40:34,077 --> 00:40:35,418
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you.

443
00:40:35,718 --> 00:40:36,579
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

444
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:38,501
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening.

445
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:40,262
[SPEAKER_11]: Please state your name and address for the record.

446
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,921
[SPEAKER_17]: My name is Samantha Sednik.

447
00:40:43,341 --> 00:40:49,346
[SPEAKER_17]: My address is 47 West Wyoming Avenue in Melrose, and I'm your children's librarian.

448
00:40:50,367 --> 00:40:53,590
[SPEAKER_17]: And I just wanted to address the books that were lost.

449
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:58,914
[SPEAKER_17]: So when the initial emails were kind of going and being posted, we did state that we lost

450
00:40:59,574 --> 00:41:01,795
[SPEAKER_17]: a little over 100 books during the current leak.

451
00:41:02,575 --> 00:41:07,537
[SPEAKER_17]: The Children's Room, as Barbara mentioned, hasn't had a lot of leaks up until quite recently.

452
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:13,078
[SPEAKER_17]: Last year, we did lose an entire shelf of reference books, which were a lot more expensive.

453
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:18,760
[SPEAKER_17]: But the silver lining to this is that people of Medford really, truly love their library.

454
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:28,743
[SPEAKER_17]: And I posted a wish list online, and within a day, all 100 books had been privately donated back to the library, and our collection has been restored.

455
00:41:32,248 --> 00:41:40,331
[SPEAKER_17]: So in terms of thinking outside of the box or looking forward to the future of the library, the citizens of Medford would like you to do that.

456
00:41:40,732 --> 00:41:45,794
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, and, and had been very, very supportive of us and we, we appreciate it.

457
00:41:45,834 --> 00:41:46,374
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you.

458
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:47,374
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Sam.

459
00:41:49,435 --> 00:41:49,916
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening.

460
00:41:49,956 --> 00:41:51,576
[SPEAKER_11]: Please state your name and address for the record.

461
00:41:51,936 --> 00:41:53,037
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm Melanie railing.

462
00:41:53,117 --> 00:41:55,058
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm at 20 Stanley Avenue in Medford.

463
00:41:55,158 --> 00:41:55,518
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously.

464
00:41:56,987 --> 00:42:06,701
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to pretty much reiterate Councilor Marx's comments in particular What's our vision for the future of I think you said what's our vision of the public library?

465
00:42:06,721 --> 00:42:09,325
[SPEAKER_00]: And really the question is what is the future of our library?

466
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:17,219
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, as Councilor Lungo-Kearns said, you know, just patches is just a temporary solution for something that it really is the heart of our city.

467
00:42:18,381 --> 00:42:24,689
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, we know, I don't know if you guys are aware, the Medford Mackey, for example, is losing its art space.

468
00:42:25,089 --> 00:42:26,571
[SPEAKER_00]: The maker space is currently

469
00:42:26,995 --> 00:42:31,557
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for a home and the library is offering to be a temporary host for the Mackey Makerspace.

470
00:42:32,217 --> 00:42:41,201
[SPEAKER_00]: It hosts Medford Family Network programs that are essential and were part, I mean, as Councilor Knight speaks about his young child, I mean, it helped me learn how to become a really great parent.

471
00:42:41,321 --> 00:42:49,305
[SPEAKER_00]: And the accessibility of the library being walkable is really important to think about as we look at providing services for the residents in the community.

472
00:42:50,005 --> 00:42:58,147
[SPEAKER_00]: Having stuff at the mall or far away at other places doesn't really serve our community the way we need it to, and the library really is in this amazing place.

473
00:42:58,627 --> 00:43:01,688
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about wanting to activate the waterfront, the library is right there.

474
00:43:01,748 --> 00:43:04,528
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about wanting to bring in a playground, bring in green space.

475
00:43:05,209 --> 00:43:11,190
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at examples such as Winchester, which has a gorgeous outside as well as inside, an amazing programming space.

476
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:18,775
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, yes, Cambridge might have the most beautiful library, and maybe that's not what we're looking at, but we can look at real examples like the Fox Library.

477
00:43:18,815 --> 00:43:20,236
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's so much talk about a cafe.

478
00:43:20,296 --> 00:43:29,082
[SPEAKER_00]: What about a store where we create, sell, use items and then create income for the library so that we can continue to offer these programs and technologies?

479
00:43:29,762 --> 00:43:34,625
[SPEAKER_00]: And other examples, the Somerville Libraries, they're actually going to be redoing a lot of those

480
00:43:35,486 --> 00:43:38,067
[SPEAKER_00]: in the next couple of years and are seeking community input.

481
00:43:38,847 --> 00:43:44,268
[SPEAKER_00]: But they are a big public space for baby-wearing meetings, for business meetings, group meetings.

482
00:43:45,168 --> 00:43:55,950
[SPEAKER_00]: As one of the co-founders of the Medford Community Coalition, we're always struggling with a place to meet so that we can have our, we have 1,250 followers now, and many of them are supporters of the library.

483
00:43:55,970 --> 00:43:58,851
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, Councilor Lungo-Koehn said that

484
00:43:59,691 --> 00:44:07,898
[SPEAKER_00]: There were 10 families who expressed their concern, but really there are hundreds of families who are behind this library, as evidenced by the May and June meetings of the budget.

485
00:44:08,519 --> 00:44:14,684
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do also encourage you, as you speak about this now, not to forget the library when it comes to the budget again in May and June.

486
00:44:14,724 --> 00:44:15,585
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very clear that

487
00:44:16,005 --> 00:44:19,306
[SPEAKER_00]: The bare minimum of $251,000 is not cutting it.

488
00:44:19,346 --> 00:44:21,626
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just getting us at the base mark.

489
00:44:22,406 --> 00:44:26,247
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, there's talks about Springstep, and we love this idea.

490
00:44:27,227 --> 00:44:29,748
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilor Scarpielli, that's so wonderful to think out of the box.

491
00:44:30,448 --> 00:44:33,008
[SPEAKER_00]: Springstep is smaller than the current library space.

492
00:44:33,148 --> 00:44:35,309
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's something really important to think about.

493
00:44:35,349 --> 00:44:40,390
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also angled, and as our children's librarian pointed out to me, it can't support the weight of the books.

494
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:49,879
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the library is deeded to be a library space that land, so maybe we should be thinking more about moving things out temporarily and rebuilding that whole building.

495
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:53,503
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, that's a lot of money, but we have to think about where our priorities are.

496
00:44:53,603 --> 00:44:59,009
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's wonderful to hear you all talk about these assessments and also the fact that there is a five-year plan.

497
00:45:00,054 --> 00:45:02,134
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to Mayor Muccini-Burke.

498
00:45:02,594 --> 00:45:11,096
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a big reason why many of these grants, these library building grants, haven't been accessible to us because we were not part of and there was no five-year plan.

499
00:45:11,636 --> 00:45:17,017
[SPEAKER_00]: So to answer that question, now that there is this plan, it's not just the library moving forward, it's really everyone.

500
00:45:17,137 --> 00:45:18,717
[SPEAKER_00]: So things to think about.

501
00:45:18,757 --> 00:45:23,438
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's think about our future and let's really build something that really represents the amazing community that Medford is.

502
00:45:23,618 --> 00:45:23,958
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

503
00:45:24,178 --> 00:45:24,558
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

504
00:45:26,159 --> 00:45:26,539
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening.

505
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:26,919
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome.

506
00:45:26,979 --> 00:45:28,299
[SPEAKER_11]: Please state your name and address for the record.

507
00:45:28,677 --> 00:45:29,877
[SPEAKER_22]: Gene Martin, 10 Cumming Street.

508
00:45:30,257 --> 00:45:31,958
[SPEAKER_22]: And you people are putting me out of work now.

509
00:45:32,718 --> 00:45:34,518
[SPEAKER_22]: You guys are taking my job from me.

510
00:45:34,818 --> 00:45:36,359
[SPEAKER_22]: You're all saying what I would have said.

511
00:45:36,759 --> 00:45:37,959
[SPEAKER_22]: So thank you very much for that.

512
00:45:39,019 --> 00:45:39,759
[SPEAKER_22]: My job here is done.

513
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:44,140
[SPEAKER_22]: For now.

514
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:45,581
[SPEAKER_22]: For now, on this one.

515
00:45:45,741 --> 00:45:48,261
[SPEAKER_22]: And I want to thank you for all supporting the library.

516
00:45:48,281 --> 00:45:49,881
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm a fan of the library.

517
00:45:50,382 --> 00:45:52,562
[SPEAKER_22]: I also just want to point out a couple of little things.

518
00:45:53,722 --> 00:45:57,303
[SPEAKER_22]: As I was talking to the assistant director, which kind of already knew,

519
00:45:57,797 --> 00:46:02,558
[SPEAKER_22]: There are certain areas that don't even have plugs because they were designed to have books along that wall.

520
00:46:03,479 --> 00:46:06,099
[SPEAKER_22]: So you're absolutely right, Mr. Falco.

521
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:08,760
[SPEAKER_22]: When you have that assessment, you need to do the bottom two.

522
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:13,841
[SPEAKER_22]: It needs to be retrofitted for all kinds of cabling and internet and all of that.

523
00:46:13,941 --> 00:46:15,402
[SPEAKER_22]: It needs to be seen as a whole package.

524
00:46:15,722 --> 00:46:19,283
[SPEAKER_22]: The other thing I'd like to say is when you conceive the library, wherever you put it,

525
00:46:19,724 --> 00:46:21,386
[SPEAKER_22]: whether it's the Springs, apparently not.

526
00:46:23,669 --> 00:46:30,276
[SPEAKER_22]: It needs to be in conjunction with the Chevalier Theatre, with the TV3, wherever the TV3 goes, which I would like to see in the Square someplace.

527
00:46:30,777 --> 00:46:38,246
[SPEAKER_22]: And it needs to also be seen with the business community, and I always think of you, because you know how to talk to all those people.

528
00:46:38,686 --> 00:46:39,127
[SPEAKER_22]: So anyway,

529
00:46:40,093 --> 00:46:41,895
[SPEAKER_22]: It needs to be seen as a bigger plan.

530
00:46:41,935 --> 00:46:48,221
[SPEAKER_22]: The whole square needs to be conceived in one big thing and not to just say, let's do this to the library.

531
00:46:48,741 --> 00:46:53,445
[SPEAKER_22]: Because, you know, especially with the Chevalier, because it's all liberal arts, it's all artsy.

532
00:46:53,966 --> 00:46:55,367
[SPEAKER_22]: So I think that they need to be married.

533
00:46:55,807 --> 00:46:58,390
[SPEAKER_22]: And I know that certain people get territorial.

534
00:46:58,710 --> 00:46:59,751
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't mean this in a bad way.

535
00:47:00,111 --> 00:47:00,511
[SPEAKER_22]: People do.

536
00:47:00,531 --> 00:47:05,676
[SPEAKER_22]: The Chevalier people may not like, you know, what the library is proposing or the library people don't.

537
00:47:06,023 --> 00:47:20,054
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, you know, let's all get together on this, and let's come up with the, let's not be territorial, let's not get defensive, and let's just move forward on that and come together on those things and build them all with the same concept in mind.

538
00:47:20,534 --> 00:47:23,337
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's all I got to say, and thank you for doing my job for me.

539
00:47:24,598 --> 00:47:25,238
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Jean.

540
00:47:26,159 --> 00:47:26,639
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening.

541
00:47:26,659 --> 00:47:27,000
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome.

542
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,601
[SPEAKER_11]: Please state your name and address for the record.

543
00:47:28,821 --> 00:47:29,241
[SPEAKER_23]: Good evening.

544
00:47:30,442 --> 00:47:32,144
[SPEAKER_23]: Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave.

545
00:47:32,404 --> 00:47:35,026
[SPEAKER_23]: Congratulations to all the new Councilors.

546
00:47:35,918 --> 00:47:41,821
[SPEAKER_23]: and to the past councilors, through the chair, to the mayor, and to Ms.

547
00:47:41,881 --> 00:47:42,762
[SPEAKER_23]: Kerr at the library.

548
00:47:43,822 --> 00:47:55,828
[SPEAKER_23]: The synergy between the library, public access, and the Chevalier, as Jean Martin just stated, it's a softball coming at us at five miles an hour.

549
00:47:56,509 --> 00:47:58,850
[SPEAKER_23]: You can pluck it out of the air, it's so simple.

550
00:47:59,130 --> 00:48:03,112
[SPEAKER_23]: And when we hear Councilor Caraviello talk about the

551
00:48:03,657 --> 00:48:06,338
[SPEAKER_23]: leaky ceiling, we have money.

552
00:48:06,939 --> 00:48:08,800
[SPEAKER_23]: And that money is public access money.

553
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:22,227
[SPEAKER_23]: And I have been waiting 12 long years to get the show that I do, which is on so many stations in so many municipalities, on the air in Medford, a show that helps and benefits the community.

554
00:48:23,107 --> 00:48:26,929
[SPEAKER_23]: Now, the history of Medford belongs at the library.

555
00:48:27,369 --> 00:48:29,530
[SPEAKER_23]: And as I said, when I was a member of TV3 in the 1990s,

556
00:48:30,935 --> 00:48:38,761
[SPEAKER_23]: We should be taking the great Tony Bova show, the hockey, the baseball, the football, the cooking, my grandmother's cooking show.

557
00:48:39,982 --> 00:48:47,207
[SPEAKER_23]: All these shows should be at the library in beautiful slimline DVD cases for the public to take out or they can go online.

558
00:48:48,028 --> 00:48:52,831
[SPEAKER_23]: But the upstairs at the library, if we loan them some money, we have the money.

559
00:48:53,532 --> 00:48:56,534
[SPEAKER_23]: This new city council knows we have the money.

560
00:48:57,274 --> 00:49:00,257
[SPEAKER_23]: It is in the public access reservoir.

561
00:49:01,046 --> 00:49:01,908
[SPEAKER_23]: that the mayor has.

562
00:49:02,749 --> 00:49:05,914
[SPEAKER_23]: And I know that this mayor is proactive with public access.

563
00:49:06,375 --> 00:49:13,728
[SPEAKER_23]: She was one of our staunchest allies, along with Michael Marks, Breanna Lungo-Koehn, and Robert M. Penta.

564
00:49:15,082 --> 00:49:18,885
[SPEAKER_23]: Stephanie Burke was one of our strongest allies when it came to public access TV.

565
00:49:19,445 --> 00:49:23,588
[SPEAKER_23]: This is the opportunity to show the community that we're going to start immediately.

566
00:49:24,048 --> 00:49:25,770
[SPEAKER_23]: Let's make an agreement with the library.

567
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:26,911
[SPEAKER_23]: Let's get some of that money.

568
00:49:27,491 --> 00:49:28,372
[SPEAKER_23]: Let's get it up and running.

569
00:49:28,392 --> 00:49:29,853
[SPEAKER_23]: Let's fix that second floor.

570
00:49:30,273 --> 00:49:33,535
[SPEAKER_23]: Let's make it a place that attracts people, because I will leave you with this thought.

571
00:49:34,656 --> 00:49:42,942
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm often at, I was at the Reading Library just now, and I'm usually at the Winchester Library or Burlington Library, gorgeous buildings.

572
00:49:43,352 --> 00:49:43,733
[SPEAKER_23]: Gorgeous.

573
00:49:44,413 --> 00:49:50,701
[SPEAKER_23]: The new Reading Library is going to be stunning, and we're in a temporary zone right now because I'm a member of Reading Cable as well.

574
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:54,325
[SPEAKER_23]: And the Cable and the libraries, they all work well together.

575
00:49:54,686 --> 00:49:57,249
[SPEAKER_23]: We must move Medford forward.

576
00:49:57,269 --> 00:49:59,431
[SPEAKER_23]: We must be partners in progress.

577
00:50:00,328 --> 00:50:01,329
[SPEAKER_23]: It's not just a slogan.

578
00:50:01,489 --> 00:50:02,049
[SPEAKER_23]: Let's do it.

579
00:50:02,649 --> 00:50:03,530
[SPEAKER_23]: This is how we do it.

580
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:04,590
[SPEAKER_23]: Let's do it right away.

581
00:50:04,951 --> 00:50:06,051
[SPEAKER_23]: I will be at those meetings.

582
00:50:06,772 --> 00:50:08,953
[SPEAKER_23]: I will be at those cultural meetings.

583
00:50:09,353 --> 00:50:13,095
[SPEAKER_23]: This is very important to me, not for me, but for the city.

584
00:50:13,695 --> 00:50:15,657
[SPEAKER_23]: Because, come on, I'm an old man.

585
00:50:15,797 --> 00:50:16,957
[SPEAKER_23]: How much time do I have left?

586
00:50:17,157 --> 00:50:18,278
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm doing this for the city.

587
00:50:18,298 --> 00:50:21,580
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm not a young man like Mr. Falco or Mr. Scarpelli.

588
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:22,180
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm an old man.

589
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:23,881
[SPEAKER_23]: Help me out before I die.

590
00:50:24,261 --> 00:50:25,382
[SPEAKER_23]: Give me my access station.

591
00:50:31,412 --> 00:50:32,933
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening, please state your name and address.

592
00:50:33,013 --> 00:50:36,776
[SPEAKER_19]: My name is John Sardone, council president, members of the council.

593
00:50:36,796 --> 00:50:55,469
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm here tonight to offer my hand to the community and beyond the community, the city of Medford for the celebration of life fundraiser for Mr. Joseph Fruzzo, who was struck up in Dracut Mass, May 3rd of this year, of last year.

594
00:50:58,111 --> 00:51:00,553
[SPEAKER_19]: He was struck from behind and left in the road for dead.

595
00:51:01,607 --> 00:51:10,772
[SPEAKER_19]: As a wife and three young children, we are having a fundraiser, on February 5th, 50-50 raffle.

596
00:51:12,133 --> 00:51:19,817
[SPEAKER_19]: Contact person is going to be Mike Leconte, 781-866-0370.

597
00:51:20,878 --> 00:51:29,703
[SPEAKER_19]: I've been to a lot of establishments, restaurants that can donate food, gift cards, whatever they can give to us so we can have

598
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:32,806
[SPEAKER_19]: more money to be raised for this young gentleman.

599
00:51:32,847 --> 00:51:34,107
[SPEAKER_19]: He was accomplished by trade.

600
00:51:34,247 --> 00:51:35,388
[SPEAKER_19]: He's never going to work again.

601
00:51:35,528 --> 00:51:37,269
[SPEAKER_19]: He's been in the rehab for the last nine months.

602
00:51:37,930 --> 00:51:38,250
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

603
00:51:39,411 --> 00:51:41,612
[SPEAKER_19]: We don't know where they're going to send them for the next rehab.

604
00:51:42,232 --> 00:51:45,174
[SPEAKER_19]: His kids are the inspirations for this young gentleman.

605
00:51:45,395 --> 00:51:49,037
[SPEAKER_19]: It's when he 42 years old, February 5th is his birthday.

606
00:51:49,597 --> 00:51:49,937
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

607
00:51:50,378 --> 00:51:52,379
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're having the fundraiser on the house from seven to 11.

608
00:51:52,579 --> 00:51:54,660
[SPEAKER_19]: We're selling tickets, $20 a person.

609
00:51:56,437 --> 00:52:02,319
[SPEAKER_19]: If anybody wants to donate other, other monies besides the tickets, we're going to accept it.

610
00:52:02,999 --> 00:52:05,620
[SPEAKER_19]: I thank you for your time and your generosity.

611
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:06,540
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you very much.

612
00:52:06,881 --> 00:52:07,461
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, John.

613
00:52:07,501 --> 00:52:08,941
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for your good work in that matter.

614
00:52:11,522 --> 00:52:11,922
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening.

615
00:52:12,002 --> 00:52:13,543
[SPEAKER_11]: Please state your name and address for the record.

616
00:52:14,063 --> 00:52:16,324
[SPEAKER_01]: May market rec 16 Glenwood have Bedford.

617
00:52:17,124 --> 00:52:24,286
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening and congratulations to the new members of the council and uh, president and vice president.

618
00:52:25,507 --> 00:52:25,567
[SPEAKER_01]: Um,

619
00:52:28,068 --> 00:52:32,010
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what we've been talking about here tonight is not new news.

620
00:52:32,971 --> 00:52:36,853
[SPEAKER_01]: The library has been in difficulty for quite some time.

621
00:52:38,173 --> 00:52:41,455
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an example of what we have here in the city.

622
00:52:42,195 --> 00:52:56,163
[SPEAKER_01]: We have very, very dedicated people who are right here in the council tonight, members who are staff of the library, just hoping that the building that they're working in wouldn't fall on their head.

623
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:58,980
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this is disgraceful.

624
00:53:04,082 --> 00:53:09,443
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some idea of how much it's going to cost to fix the roof at the library.

625
00:53:10,304 --> 00:53:19,847
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody who's living in this city and is paying any attention, as Councilor Mark said, we have a lot of leaky roofs around here.

626
00:53:20,507 --> 00:53:21,267
[SPEAKER_01]: We have mold.

627
00:53:21,567 --> 00:53:24,248
[SPEAKER_01]: We have all kinds of distasteful conditions.

628
00:53:26,552 --> 00:53:31,656
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that money is difficult to come by to fix these things.

629
00:53:31,836 --> 00:53:38,280
[SPEAKER_01]: This is only the second day of a new day of a new administration.

630
00:53:39,041 --> 00:53:44,325
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it is important to talk about these things because they're very serious.

631
00:53:45,525 --> 00:53:47,507
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've just mentioned this.

632
00:53:48,507 --> 00:53:54,772
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I shouldn't, but we all know that there is a considerable amount of free cash

633
00:53:55,777 --> 00:53:57,278
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhere in this building.

634
00:53:59,138 --> 00:54:06,001
[SPEAKER_01]: And perhaps it's time to think about using some of it for these very serious problems.

635
00:54:08,142 --> 00:54:14,525
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing I would like to mention, and it's a very small item, however, it does bother me a little bit.

636
00:54:15,546 --> 00:54:21,008
[SPEAKER_01]: At the time, we were talking about the lack of certification for the library.

637
00:54:21,921 --> 00:54:25,162
[SPEAKER_01]: which, of course, was over a period of a number of years.

638
00:54:26,542 --> 00:54:33,723
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a longtime resident here of Medford, I think it was very unfortunate to have that happen.

639
00:54:34,164 --> 00:54:43,926
[SPEAKER_01]: But at that time, I happened to find out that there is a group of trustees connected with the library.

640
00:54:45,746 --> 00:54:47,326
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not know who these people are.

641
00:54:48,727 --> 00:54:50,287
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe they are five members.

642
00:54:51,270 --> 00:54:53,991
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would be very interesting to learn.

643
00:54:54,011 --> 00:55:00,215
[SPEAKER_01]: Does anybody, Mr. President, do you know what the responsibilities are of the trustees of the library?

644
00:55:02,036 --> 00:55:03,436
[SPEAKER_01]: Or does any Councilor here know?

645
00:55:07,959 --> 00:55:09,680
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I guess we need a little education.

646
00:55:14,883 --> 00:55:15,783
[SPEAKER_01]: Including myself.

647
00:55:16,603 --> 00:55:19,325
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a very small item, however.

648
00:55:20,045 --> 00:55:23,288
[SPEAKER_01]: We have people in the city that are being paid to do a job.

649
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:27,512
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody even knows what that job is.

650
00:55:28,553 --> 00:55:29,794
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're picking up a paycheck.

651
00:55:30,174 --> 00:55:34,638
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe the council should find out exactly what the responsibilities are of these trustees.

652
00:55:35,339 --> 00:55:39,863
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we're really not getting our money's worth, maybe something should be done about it.

653
00:55:40,063 --> 00:55:40,784
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

654
00:55:43,946 --> 00:55:44,407
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Meg.

655
00:55:47,764 --> 00:55:48,905
[SPEAKER_08]: Should I restate who I am?

656
00:55:49,205 --> 00:55:49,846
[SPEAKER_11]: Please do.

657
00:55:50,306 --> 00:55:54,210
[SPEAKER_08]: Barbara Kerr, 35 Baker Place, Newton Lower Falls.

658
00:55:55,311 --> 00:55:57,493
[SPEAKER_08]: I can tell you a little bit about the trustees, if that would help.

659
00:55:58,595 --> 00:56:03,499
[SPEAKER_08]: According to Matt, there is a section in the Massachusetts General Laws, which I can send all of you tomorrow, if you'd like.

660
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:11,147
[SPEAKER_08]: They have fiduciary responsibility over the library, and they are responsible for hiring the library director.

661
00:56:12,253 --> 00:56:13,854
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are their two main responsibilities.

662
00:56:13,874 --> 00:56:14,935
[SPEAKER_08]: There are a whole bunch of other things, too.

663
00:56:15,075 --> 00:56:20,059
[SPEAKER_08]: But there are set legal responsibilities that they do have.

664
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:23,702
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would be happy to send that to you if you would like me to.

665
00:56:23,722 --> 00:56:28,206
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that all right?

666
00:56:29,107 --> 00:56:30,328
[SPEAKER_07]: A statement?

667
00:56:31,289 --> 00:56:32,810
[SPEAKER_11]: Go ahead, Madam Vice President.

668
00:56:32,830 --> 00:56:35,532
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just going to ask if they got a statement.

669
00:56:35,592 --> 00:56:36,493
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that was a question.

670
00:56:36,533 --> 00:56:37,374
[SPEAKER_10]: They do.

671
00:56:37,494 --> 00:56:38,735
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, I have right here

672
00:56:40,272 --> 00:56:50,935
[SPEAKER_10]: document produced by the administration December 17, 2015, outlining all of our boards and commissions that are under the authority of the administration, Mr. President, as well as the members and the terms that they hold.

673
00:56:51,815 --> 00:56:56,396
[SPEAKER_10]: We have five members appointed to a three-year term on the board of library trustees.

674
00:56:57,997 --> 00:57:07,440
[SPEAKER_10]: There are three $600 annual stipends, one $900 stipend for the chair and one $700 stipend for the vice chair, Mr. President.

675
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:08,940
[SPEAKER_10]: That addresses any of those questions.

676
00:57:13,087 --> 00:57:13,767
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

677
00:57:13,787 --> 00:57:15,708
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to call a vote now.

678
00:57:19,508 --> 00:57:20,309
[SPEAKER_11]: You want to speak?

679
00:57:20,909 --> 00:57:21,309
[SPEAKER_11]: Come along.

680
00:57:23,749 --> 00:57:28,310
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion for approval on the resolution of Councilor Caraviello.

681
00:57:31,031 --> 00:57:38,632
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion of approval was from Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Caraviello, as amended by Councilors Caraviello, Lungo-Koehn,

682
00:57:39,139 --> 00:57:41,481
[SPEAKER_11]: Falco, Scarpelli, and Marks.

683
00:57:42,121 --> 00:57:43,162
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

684
00:57:44,203 --> 00:57:44,804
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

685
00:57:44,824 --> 00:57:45,644
[SPEAKER_11]: Roll call vote, Mr. President.

686
00:57:47,306 --> 00:57:50,689
[SPEAKER_11]: Roll call vote has been requested, Mr. Clerk, if you would kindly call the roll.

687
00:58:03,099 --> 00:58:03,940
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Caraviello?

688
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:04,120
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

689
00:58:05,201 --> 00:58:05,981
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Falco?

690
00:58:06,161 --> 00:58:06,962
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

691
00:58:06,982 --> 00:58:07,563
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Knight?

692
00:58:07,643 --> 00:58:07,783
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

693
00:58:08,538 --> 00:58:09,599
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

694
00:58:09,619 --> 00:58:09,679
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

695
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:10,780
[SPEAKER_15]: Council Marks.

696
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:10,880
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

697
00:58:11,801 --> 00:58:12,562
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Scarpelli.

698
00:58:12,582 --> 00:58:12,662
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

699
00:58:13,402 --> 00:58:14,143
[SPEAKER_15]: President Del Russo.

700
00:58:14,263 --> 00:58:14,583
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

701
00:58:14,764 --> 00:58:17,646
[SPEAKER_11]: With a vote of seven, the affirmative, none, the negative.

702
00:58:17,706 --> 00:58:20,569
[SPEAKER_11]: The motion passes.

703
00:58:20,589 --> 00:58:24,012
[SPEAKER_11]: 16-011 offered by Councilor Caraviello be resolved at the Medford City Council.

704
00:58:24,512 --> 00:58:33,400
[SPEAKER_11]: Look into the possibility of temporary parking on Main Street during the Craddock Bridge construction after the bus stop has moved to its new location.

705
00:58:34,161 --> 00:58:35,762
[SPEAKER_11]: Chair recognizes Councilor Caraviello.

706
00:58:36,362 --> 00:58:37,103
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

707
00:58:37,163 --> 00:58:43,527
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if people have noticed, but the temporary bridge is up and going now, and they're starting to work on the old bridge.

708
00:58:45,769 --> 00:59:04,222
[SPEAKER_06]: At the beginning of the road there, the road is quite open and wide there, and I was with, the other night, I was having dinner with our state representative Donato, and we were discussing how possibly we could put some parking spaces, maybe half a dozen parking spaces in front of there.

709
00:59:05,947 --> 00:59:09,488
[SPEAKER_06]: that part of Main Street during the construction time, seeing that there's nothing there.

710
00:59:10,348 --> 00:59:22,091
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I talked to Representative Denial this morning, he had explained to me that he had spoken to the construction people and the people from the DOT, and they think that is a very good possibility to do that.

711
00:59:22,671 --> 00:59:34,094
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would think that the businesses that are affected the most could benefit from maybe those extra half a dozen parking spaces over there during this construction time.

712
00:59:34,963 --> 00:59:42,027
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know if this goes to the Traffic Commission or we do that on our own, but I think it would be a good gesture to do that.

713
00:59:42,227 --> 00:59:51,292
[SPEAKER_11]: Perhaps we send it to the administration to make a decision and disseminate it to the appropriate department.

714
00:59:51,972 --> 00:59:53,393
[SPEAKER_11]: Always an advocate for business.

715
00:59:53,573 --> 00:59:54,413
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

716
00:59:55,134 --> 00:59:56,875
[SPEAKER_11]: Chair recognizes Vice President Longo-Curran.

717
00:59:57,015 --> 00:59:58,496
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

718
00:59:58,696 --> 01:00:02,338
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, with that, if we can look into, as I drove by,

719
01:00:03,417 --> 01:00:09,701
[SPEAKER_07]: looks like there's Jersey barriers from the auto school all the way down to the section into the square.

720
01:00:09,741 --> 01:00:17,125
[SPEAKER_07]: So anybody that wants to frequent say, you know, Carol's restaurant or ERA Realty has to walk, you know, all the way around.

721
01:00:17,525 --> 01:00:24,289
[SPEAKER_07]: If that could just be looked at to see if it's possible to maybe make a gap in one of the barriers, possible temporary crosswalk.

722
01:00:24,669 --> 01:00:30,613
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure if that's, you know, feasible, but if they can look into that possibility, um, there was a,

723
01:00:31,378 --> 01:00:39,484
[SPEAKER_07]: section in the Island that was, you know, clear of, you know, shrubs so that people could cross the road in a safe manner.

724
01:00:39,544 --> 01:00:41,685
[SPEAKER_07]: So if that could be looked into as well.

725
01:00:42,186 --> 01:00:42,526
[SPEAKER_11]: Very good.

726
01:00:42,726 --> 01:00:44,447
[SPEAKER_11]: As amended by vice president Logan current.

727
01:00:45,468 --> 01:00:45,808
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

728
01:00:45,928 --> 01:00:48,290
[SPEAKER_11]: Madam vice president chair recognizes council night.

729
01:00:48,710 --> 01:00:56,736
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, Mr. President, in looking at the resolution, uh, be a result of the city council, look into the possibility of a temporary parking on main street during the credit bridge reconstruction.

730
01:00:56,776 --> 01:00:59,718
[SPEAKER_10]: I certainly have no problem with that, but, um, as councilor Caraviello,

731
01:01:00,501 --> 01:01:10,464
[SPEAKER_10]: initiated and cited as you did as well, would it be appropriate for the traffic commission to review this, the administration to review this, or the city council's subcommittee on transportation, Mr. President?

732
01:01:10,484 --> 01:01:16,506
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that by taking a two-fold approach, we'll be much more successful in actually accomplishing the objective, Mr. President.

733
01:01:16,526 --> 01:01:18,907
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that it would make sense if we are going to, in fact,

734
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:35,184
[SPEAKER_10]: send a paper to the administration to look into it, that we also hold a transportation subcommittee meeting and have the administration come before us and explain to us the reasoning why they feel as though this is a bad idea, whether or not there are public safety issues that surround it, what the traffic commission's position is on it as well, Mr. President.

735
01:01:35,204 --> 01:01:37,546
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be very important as to whether or not this really happens.

736
01:01:38,327 --> 01:01:45,073
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that, you know, as we look at the end result and how to get to the solution, I think that it would make more sense, Mr. President, for us to send a

737
01:01:45,742 --> 01:01:54,807
[SPEAKER_10]: correspondence to the administration, but also hold a subcommittee meeting where the individuals that are in a position to set this policy will be able to appear before us and explain to us why it is or is not a good idea.

738
01:01:55,167 --> 01:01:55,467
[SPEAKER_10]: Very good.

739
01:01:55,587 --> 01:01:56,868
[SPEAKER_10]: So, uh, we'll do this.

740
01:01:57,008 --> 01:01:58,649
[SPEAKER_06]: We will, if you could, uh, yes.

741
01:01:58,789 --> 01:02:08,414
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, I, I, I agree with council and I'd only be, uh, for one point is because I'm, I'm really not happy about where they're anticipating moving the bus stop to, which is for what I understand under the bridge.

742
01:02:09,354 --> 01:02:12,116
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't think that's a probably a place to move that bus stop.

743
01:02:12,196 --> 01:02:12,796
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it should be,

744
01:02:13,805 --> 01:02:20,410
[SPEAKER_06]: possibly on Riverside Avenue, maybe turn River Street for a short time into one way going the opposite way.

745
01:02:21,231 --> 01:02:24,934
[SPEAKER_11]: I was under the impression that it was going to stay where it was, but I may be mistaken.

746
01:02:25,434 --> 01:02:29,717
[SPEAKER_11]: In any event, if we- Yeah, let's have an update on that from the administration.

747
01:02:29,737 --> 01:02:33,560
[SPEAKER_06]: According to the representative, it was going to be moved further down.

748
01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:37,063
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're also going to send this to the administration.

749
01:02:37,822 --> 01:02:48,587
[SPEAKER_11]: And also the, uh, chair, uh, pro tempore of the, uh, transportation committee will call a meeting, uh, for that since we can't send the paper to places at once.

750
01:02:49,988 --> 01:02:50,348
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

751
01:02:50,608 --> 01:02:56,270
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's a, uh, an amendment that the, uh, chair call the subcommittee meetings on that.

752
01:02:57,171 --> 01:02:59,512
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, and, uh, we have a gentleman at the podium.

753
01:02:59,983 --> 01:03:04,289
[SPEAKER_11]: who will shed light on this matter, and we invite you to state your name and address for the record.

754
01:03:04,609 --> 01:03:07,093
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Maury Carroll, 31 Richard Street, Medford.

755
01:03:07,534 --> 01:03:09,116
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. Carroll.

756
01:03:09,136 --> 01:03:16,486
[SPEAKER_04]: This all came about that I have some friends that have done a lot of construction in similar situations that is going on right now down there.

757
01:03:17,641 --> 01:03:30,544
[SPEAKER_04]: They brought it to my attention that in projects in the past, that this has been an occurrence that has happened as being allowed to have some sort of parking in the construction area when construction isn't going on.

758
01:03:31,965 --> 01:03:37,586
[SPEAKER_04]: At that time, we talked to Rick, and Paul was there, and we brought it to this point.

759
01:03:38,843 --> 01:03:41,525
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's a lot of other things going on down there.

760
01:03:41,565 --> 01:03:47,209
[SPEAKER_04]: As Brianna mentioned that they've got all those Jersey barriers right now blocking us off completely.

761
01:03:47,889 --> 01:03:48,990
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a retail business.

762
01:03:50,211 --> 01:03:51,692
[SPEAKER_04]: I depend on traffic flow.

763
01:03:52,012 --> 01:03:58,076
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not a professional business that has, you know, one appointment an hour that is somehow some way you're gonna make it.

764
01:03:58,597 --> 01:04:04,821
[SPEAKER_04]: The people are deterred from any access whatsoever or difficult access.

765
01:04:05,998 --> 01:04:06,698
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not going to come.

766
01:04:07,318 --> 01:04:10,239
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, already we're shutting down for lunch as of this week.

767
01:04:10,299 --> 01:04:12,560
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not going to, the sidewalks are closed.

768
01:04:12,580 --> 01:04:14,720
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no way for people to get there.

769
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:19,282
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I decided that as a Friday, we will just shut down for lunch.

770
01:04:20,502 --> 01:04:23,523
[SPEAKER_04]: You have companies showing up as of last night, nine o'clock.

771
01:04:23,543 --> 01:04:25,683
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not supposed to do work before 10 o'clock.

772
01:04:26,243 --> 01:04:30,104
[SPEAKER_04]: They're out there right in front of the place, blocking us, shutting us down.

773
01:04:30,925 --> 01:04:31,905
[SPEAKER_04]: No police detail.

774
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:38,904
[SPEAKER_04]: They stretched the bus stops so far that people missed the buses, because their trucks were blocking people waiting for the buses.

775
01:04:40,446 --> 01:04:45,249
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a little bit like the Wild Wild West going on down there right now.

776
01:04:46,130 --> 01:04:53,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Somewhere along the line, someone has to grab the horns of this thing and get it back under control, because right now it's a runaway train.

777
01:04:56,917 --> 01:05:00,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Paul Donato has set up a meeting with me with some of the powers to be tomorrow night.

778
01:05:01,099 --> 01:05:02,040
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all fine and good.

779
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:05,842
[SPEAKER_04]: We've met, we've talked, we had meetings before this construction even started.

780
01:05:05,862 --> 01:05:09,444
[SPEAKER_04]: They were going to be the best things since sliced bread.

781
01:05:10,204 --> 01:05:15,207
[SPEAKER_04]: And the lack of communication and just steamrolling the project.

782
01:05:15,227 --> 01:05:17,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever they want to do, they do.

783
01:05:18,229 --> 01:05:19,850
[SPEAKER_04]: And we need help.

784
01:05:19,870 --> 01:05:21,671
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll tell you right now, we need help.

785
01:05:24,892 --> 01:05:25,733
[SPEAKER_11]: Point of information.

786
01:05:26,847 --> 01:05:35,133
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I know when we were here as guests, they mentioned something about an email.

787
01:05:35,713 --> 01:05:36,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Have they done that?

788
01:05:37,815 --> 01:05:39,916
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if we have.

789
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:41,497
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't received an update on that.

790
01:05:41,517 --> 01:05:44,739
[SPEAKER_11]: Has anybody, any of the Councilors?

791
01:05:44,819 --> 01:05:45,600
[SPEAKER_11]: That's telling.

792
01:05:46,342 --> 01:05:47,902
[SPEAKER_11]: if they haven't with this issue?

793
01:05:47,922 --> 01:05:54,444
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm supposed to be on the email and I got a forward to me from other people and I questioned the project manager on behalf of DOT.

794
01:05:54,844 --> 01:05:55,725
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, you're there.

795
01:05:55,845 --> 01:05:56,745
[SPEAKER_04]: I checked my junk.

796
01:05:56,845 --> 01:05:59,206
[SPEAKER_04]: I checked the vice mayor, nothing there.

797
01:06:00,166 --> 01:06:04,407
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe they put them out every, either every two or three weeks, they put them out George.

798
01:06:04,987 --> 01:06:14,890
[SPEAKER_04]: When they have their, when they have their meetings, they have their progress report meetings either every two or three weeks where they meet with OCD supposedly, they meet with DPW.

799
01:06:15,848 --> 01:06:20,332
[SPEAKER_04]: We've never been informed or privy to any of these meetings up to this point.

800
01:06:23,856 --> 01:06:24,616
[SPEAKER_11]: Madam Vice President.

801
01:06:24,857 --> 01:06:25,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

802
01:06:25,197 --> 01:06:29,481
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if it was a few weeks ago when we did have them before us answering questions.

803
01:06:29,541 --> 01:06:32,324
[SPEAKER_07]: So they did say they're going to send every two or three weeks.

804
01:06:32,444 --> 01:06:34,326
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe I haven't received anything either.

805
01:06:34,346 --> 01:06:36,408
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think it's- The clerk said we got something.

806
01:06:36,708 --> 01:06:36,888
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

807
01:06:36,968 --> 01:06:37,268
[SPEAKER_07]: We did.

808
01:06:37,809 --> 01:06:40,492
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe if you could forward it to the whole council, that would be good.

809
01:06:41,767 --> 01:06:51,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, when they did give the email, I was notifying department heads within City Hall, make sure you email Dan from DOT to get on an email list.

810
01:06:51,791 --> 01:06:54,252
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that tells you what you need to know.

811
01:06:54,572 --> 01:07:08,497
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to have a department head, and it seems like the shuffle game is being played because there's really no specific department that controls DOT, but somebody within City Hall, whether that's OCD or building or,

812
01:07:10,364 --> 01:07:23,909
[SPEAKER_07]: DPW, somebody needs to get involved with this situation so there is a contact within City Hall that can help the businesses, help the people that traverse our sidewalks, help what's going on down there.

813
01:07:23,969 --> 01:07:28,811
[SPEAKER_07]: To put Jersey barriers and block off business is not helpful to the community.

814
01:07:28,951 --> 01:07:34,733
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, to close down a business seems really absurd to me and it's sad that

815
01:07:35,026 --> 01:07:41,508
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, the council had to have DOT here and then notify department heads to, hey, why don't you email them so you can get updates.

816
01:07:42,208 --> 01:07:48,009
[SPEAKER_07]: DOT should be, get people from City Hall involved, and if not, we need to do it ourselves.

817
01:07:48,069 --> 01:07:58,772
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to have somebody in City Hall get involved and figure out what the concerns and questions are and get some, you know, resolve to our issues.

818
01:08:00,513 --> 01:08:01,353
[SPEAKER_07]: It's unbelievable.

819
01:08:02,721 --> 01:08:06,302
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the lack of signage in direction for people down there.

820
01:08:06,482 --> 01:08:10,404
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's really unbelievable.

821
01:08:10,444 --> 01:08:12,805
[SPEAKER_04]: There is no direction for people to go in.

822
01:08:12,845 --> 01:08:14,645
[SPEAKER_04]: They park certain places.

823
01:08:15,145 --> 01:08:16,986
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't know where the crosswalks are.

824
01:08:17,546 --> 01:08:23,708
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't know what's open, what isn't, you know, it is just, it's a serious problem.

825
01:08:25,529 --> 01:08:28,390
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, you know, and I think

826
01:08:29,129 --> 01:08:32,751
[SPEAKER_11]: Something that's been clear, if I just may, from the chair, speak briefly.

827
01:08:34,672 --> 01:08:48,141
[SPEAKER_11]: Something that's been made clear to the new administration and part of some of the transition talks is a need for communication and a need for a point person on projects and issues like you're facing, Laurie.

828
01:08:48,681 --> 01:08:52,884
[SPEAKER_11]: Because you shouldn't be put through this.

829
01:08:53,864 --> 01:08:55,185
[SPEAKER_11]: And no one should.

830
01:08:55,405 --> 01:08:58,167
[SPEAKER_11]: And we support you.

831
01:08:59,008 --> 01:09:00,829
[SPEAKER_11]: I know you always have, and I appreciate you.

832
01:09:01,169 --> 01:09:02,510
[SPEAKER_11]: And we'll continue to move on this.

833
01:09:02,530 --> 01:09:02,610

[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

855

859
01:10:21,734 --> 01:10:24,476
[SPEAKER_20]: Are you going to be selling convenience items in the store?

864
01:10:38,430 --> 01:10:41,612

865
01:10:42,773 --> 01:10:44,394
[SPEAKER_02]: I say one-third of.

866
01:10:45,355 --> 01:10:46,656
[SPEAKER_02]: One-third.

867
01:10:46,736 --> 01:10:47,657

[SPEAKER_20]: So three-quarters consists of convenience items, newspapers, all — The reason why I ask, Mr. President, that store, in the last several years, has changed hands a number of times.

873
01:11:11,279 --> 01:11:17,522
[SPEAKER_20]: The person you're taking over for, I believe, took over maybe a year ago.

874
01:11:22,883 --> 01:11:34,750
[SPEAKER_20]: It wasn't too long ago, Mr. President, and for a period of time, I know they fixed the sidewalk in front, and that was a blight to the whole neighborhood and a safety concern, too.

875
01:11:35,590 --> 01:11:38,312
[SPEAKER_20]: And I know there's been some graffiti on the side of the building.

876
01:11:38,905 --> 01:11:49,557
[SPEAKER_20]: So if you could do whatever you can to make sure the fourth street side, if there's any graffiti in the wall, that that be taken care of immediately.

877
01:11:50,498 --> 01:11:51,519
[SPEAKER_20]: But I wish you well.

878
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:53,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Appreciate it, thank you.

879
01:11:53,722 --> 01:11:54,102

01:11:59,148 --> 01:11:59,348
[SPEAKER_11]: It is.

883
01:11:59,368 --> 01:11:59,889

[SPEAKER_11]: If I can, thank you, Mr. President.

901
01:12:47,202 --> 01:12:50,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Just the question that I'm reaching out to my

902
01:12:51,513 --> 01:13:05,820
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a few phone calls from a few constituents and asking if there is a Christmas tree pickup in the community and when and where, and if it'll be posted and where it will be posted so they can put their Christmas trees out on the sidewalk.

903
01:13:06,401 --> 01:13:06,981
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it next week?

904
01:13:07,021 --> 01:13:08,562
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, just so if we know.

905
01:13:08,742 --> 01:13:09,622
[SPEAKER_21]: Next week's pickup?

906
01:13:10,082 --> 01:13:10,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

907
01:13:10,683 --> 01:13:12,924
[SPEAKER_05]: So if maybe- Regular trash pickup?

908
01:13:13,484 --> 01:13:13,744
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

909
01:13:13,924 --> 01:13:16,766
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know where they post that?

910
01:13:16,826 --> 01:13:18,527
[SPEAKER_05]: If we could ask where they can post it, if they can.

911
01:13:19,647 --> 01:13:20,988
[SPEAKER_11]: Chair recognizes Councilor Caraviello.

912
01:13:21,796 --> 01:13:25,178
[SPEAKER_06]: maybe Captain Clemente could give us an informational call on that.

913
01:13:25,599 --> 01:13:30,902
[SPEAKER_11]: That we meant that Captain Clemente saved the day by giving an informational call.

914
01:13:30,922 --> 01:13:31,643
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't recommend that.

915
01:13:31,703 --> 01:13:36,886
[SPEAKER_06]: I myself have gotten a few dozen calls, people have asked me.

916
01:13:37,386 --> 01:13:38,967
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's one of the things.

917
01:13:39,007 --> 01:13:41,229
[SPEAKER_06]: It was posted on the webpage, I didn't even look.

918
01:13:41,269 --> 01:13:42,449
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was on the newspaper.

919
01:13:42,610 --> 01:13:45,191
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe that's one of the issues, is the webpages.

920
01:13:45,211 --> 01:13:47,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the webpages were questionable.

921
01:13:47,513 --> 01:13:49,474
[SPEAKER_06]: But maybe if Captain Clemente could maybe

922
01:13:50,180 --> 01:13:51,881
[SPEAKER_06]: let the people know about the Christmas tree disposal.

923
01:13:52,422 --> 01:13:52,762
[SPEAKER_11]: Excellent.

924
01:13:53,022 --> 01:13:55,925
[SPEAKER_11]: So on the motion of Councilors, get Pelly as amended.

925

930
01:14:09,797 --> 01:14:10,837
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, Councilor.

931
01:14:12,819 --> 01:14:14,501
[SPEAKER_20]: Uh, thank you, Mr. President.

932
01:14:14,541 --> 01:14:17,303
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. Martin Eddie, uh, was a long time method resident.

933
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:27,367
[SPEAKER_20]: He was the founder and president of Montanetti Enterprises, which was a masonry company at two different locations.

934
01:14:28,168 --> 01:14:34,552
[SPEAKER_20]: And from what I understand, it's the largest non-union masonry company in Massachusetts.

935
01:14:35,433 --> 01:14:44,380
[SPEAKER_20]: And Mr. Benamino was a terrific family man, many grandkids and grandchildren.

936
01:14:46,226 --> 01:14:53,413
[SPEAKER_20]: his sons and daughters standouts in the community, and he will be sorely missed, Mr. President.

937
01:14:54,194 --> 01:14:59,219
[SPEAKER_20]: And on behalf of this council, I want to wish his family well, Mr. President, with their grieving.

938
01:14:59,580 --> 01:15:01,141
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor, for those sentiments.

939
01:15:01,582 --> 01:15:04,345
[SPEAKER_11]: Please rise, if you could, for a moment of silence.

940
01:15:20,632 --> 01:15:23,273
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. President, do we have more under suspension?

941
01:15:23,293 --> 01:15:24,533
[SPEAKER_11]: We have nothing else under suspension.

942
01:15:24,553 --> 01:15:25,854
[SPEAKER_20]: I just have one announcement, if I could.

943
01:15:26,334 --> 01:15:27,034
[SPEAKER_11]: We'd be delighted.

944
01:15:27,595 --> 01:15:28,515
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. President.

945
01:15:29,135 --> 01:15:30,215
[SPEAKER_20]: I just got news today.

[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm proud to say the friends of Chevalier were recently selected.

[SPEAKER_20]: Why are you looking at me?

955
01:16:49,779 --> 01:16:51,140
[SPEAKER_05]: One can't help but do it there.

956
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:54,003
[SPEAKER_20]: I figured I'd get my biggest bang.

957
01:16:56,184 --> 01:16:57,065
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. President.

958
01:16:57,425 --> 01:16:57,906

01:17:03,090 --> 01:17:04,791

[SPEAKER_11]: 15-008, uh, 16-008, excuse me, petition by Joseph Viglione, 59 Garfield Avenue, Medford, Mass., to discuss each member of the transition team of the new administration.

964
01:17:17,588 --> 01:17:23,853
[SPEAKER_11]: With regret, I must inform you, Mr. Viglione, that I again find this paper out of order.

965
01:17:24,333 --> 01:17:26,055
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not in the purview of the city council.

966
01:17:26,115 --> 01:17:29,137
[SPEAKER_11]: This was ruled out of order in substance last week.

967
01:17:29,817 --> 01:17:35,241
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm sorry if you have questions for the members of the transition team.

968
01:17:35,802 --> 01:17:41,105
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an advisory committee put together by the administration, and so it's not under our purview.

969
01:17:42,849 --> 01:17:46,850
[SPEAKER_11]: with all due respects, rule this matter as a matter of procedure, out of order.

970
01:17:46,870 --> 01:17:50,291
[SPEAKER_23]: The chair has been challenged on this matter.

971
01:18:12,195 --> 01:18:13,515
[SPEAKER_11]: by Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

972
01:18:14,196 --> 01:18:14,856
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Clerk.

973
01:18:15,636 --> 01:18:16,877
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. President, before you call.

974
01:18:17,497 --> 01:18:17,737
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

975
01:18:18,357 --> 01:18:27,720
[SPEAKER_20]: I, you know, the city of Malden has a great part of their council agenda.

976
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:33,582
[SPEAKER_20]: We have public participation, which is under the rules and regulations of our city agenda.

977
01:18:33,962 --> 01:18:36,003
[SPEAKER_20]: And the city of Malden does something pretty unique.

978
01:18:36,143 --> 01:18:38,864
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm just throwing out as a potential suggestion.

979
01:18:39,664 --> 01:18:41,725
[SPEAKER_20]: They have prior to their regularly scheduled

980
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:49,098
[SPEAKER_20]: City Council meetings, a public forum meeting where every elected official on the council shows up.

981
01:18:49,619 --> 01:18:56,142
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's a public forum where residents get up, talk on any and every subject they want.

982
01:18:56,842 --> 01:19:02,005
[SPEAKER_20]: There's really, they have a time limit, but it's, from what I've been told, it's not really adhered to.

983
01:19:02,485 --> 01:19:10,389
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's just a great way of listening to, as we know what's going on tonight, there's a big meeting on constituent services and how do we best

984
01:19:10,795 --> 01:19:12,856
[SPEAKER_20]: improve constituent services in the community.

985
01:19:13,276 --> 01:19:17,076
[SPEAKER_20]: And much of that is to allow open public forums and debate and discussion.

986
01:19:17,717 --> 01:19:29,059
[SPEAKER_20]: And, you know, maybe this particular meeting, Mr. President, which I appreciate your role as council president, has to be run in a way that we do the people's business and move on from issue to issue.

987
01:19:29,719 --> 01:19:34,080
[SPEAKER_20]: It can't be bogged down with the daily business of hearing things.

988
01:19:34,141 --> 01:19:40,422
[SPEAKER_20]: But maybe a forum like that, even if we did it once a month, to have a meeting prior to our meeting,

989
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:44,721
[SPEAKER_20]: that's open to the public and they can come up and address the council on anything.

990
01:19:44,981 --> 01:19:45,841
[SPEAKER_20]: They don't have to attend.

991
01:19:46,421 --> 01:19:50,022
[SPEAKER_20]: Cause right now to be on public participation, you got to contact the city clerk.

992
01:19:50,642 --> 01:19:53,582
[SPEAKER_20]: You have to write out what your intent is, what you'd like to speak on.

993
01:19:54,022 --> 01:20:01,844
[SPEAKER_20]: And maybe if we hold a forum like that, you know, talk about opening up the lines of communication between city government and the public.

994
01:20:02,584 --> 01:20:04,704
[SPEAKER_20]: That may be an option, Mr. President.

995
01:20:04,784 --> 01:20:07,645
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think maybe residents, uh,

996
01:20:08,005 --> 01:20:10,086
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, there's no two, we don't have to turn the TV on.

997
01:20:10,106 --> 01:20:15,627
[SPEAKER_20]: Some people don't like to get up to the podium because they don't want to be on TV and they don't, uh, afraid of speaking in front of a lot of people.

998
01:20:16,027 --> 01:20:19,389
[SPEAKER_20]: And so this might be a great suggestion, uh, Mr. President.

999
01:20:19,469 --> 01:20:23,730
[SPEAKER_20]: And, uh, maybe when we review our council rules, uh, we can review that also.

1000
01:20:24,210 --> 01:20:24,850
[SPEAKER_11]: Without a doubt.

1001
01:20:25,670 --> 01:20:25,991
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1002
01:20:26,031 --> 01:20:26,571
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilman.

1003
01:20:26,971 --> 01:20:28,011
[SPEAKER_11]: The chair has been challenged.

1004
01:20:28,051 --> 01:20:33,693
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Clerk, uh, if you would call the role, a yes vote upholds the chair's ruling.

1005
01:20:34,758 --> 01:20:35,539
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Caraviello?

1006
01:20:35,579 --> 01:20:35,759
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1007
01:20:36,519 --> 01:20:37,019
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Falco?

1008
01:20:37,039 --> 01:20:37,220
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1009
01:20:38,140 --> 01:20:38,661
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight?

1010
01:20:38,781 --> 01:20:39,161
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1011
01:20:39,861 --> 01:20:40,802
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Long and Kern?

1012
01:20:40,942 --> 01:20:41,122
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

1013
01:20:41,783 --> 01:20:42,303
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Miles?

1014
01:20:42,563 --> 01:20:42,763
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

1015
01:20:44,024 --> 01:20:44,764
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1016
01:20:44,885 --> 01:20:45,065
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1017
01:20:45,785 --> 01:20:46,586
[SPEAKER_14]: President Dello Russo?

1018
01:20:46,706 --> 01:20:46,946
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1019
01:20:46,986 --> 01:20:50,588
[SPEAKER_11]: With a vote of five in the affirmative, two in the negative, the chair is upheld.

1020
01:20:50,868 --> 01:20:53,630
[SPEAKER_11]: See you in court.

1021
01:20:53,650 --> 01:20:57,773
[SPEAKER_11]: 16-009, petition by Joseph Figlioni, 59 Garfield Avenue, Medford, Mass.

1022
01:20:58,373 --> 01:21:04,177
[SPEAKER_11]: No confidence vote on Frederick Dello Russo as president for A, not adhering to the First Amendment,

1023
01:21:04,927 --> 01:21:08,569
[SPEAKER_11]: B, calling paper out of order before citizen speaks.

1024
01:21:09,130 --> 01:21:12,512
[SPEAKER_11]: C, failing to have address given at council.

1025
01:21:12,772 --> 01:21:13,753
[SPEAKER_07]: If I may.

1026
01:21:14,093 --> 01:21:15,014
[SPEAKER_11]: Madam Vice President.

1027
01:21:15,154 --> 01:21:31,364
[SPEAKER_07]: Council President, I would just like to ask our city solicitor for an opinion, just because when you look it up, a motion of no confidence, I thought it had to be proposed by a member of the Medford City Council.

1028
01:21:31,424 --> 01:21:31,945
[SPEAKER_06]: You are correct.

1029
01:21:32,805 --> 01:21:34,146
[SPEAKER_06]: I did talk to the solicitor today.

1030
01:21:34,465 --> 01:21:35,925
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we could just get a written opinion.

1031
01:21:35,945 --> 01:21:43,827
[SPEAKER_07]: I know I'm one that would like the public to be able to speak, but when it has to do with a no confidence vote, that's very serious.

1032
01:21:43,867 --> 01:21:48,089
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe we've only had that happen one other time in my 14 years.

1033
01:21:48,169 --> 01:21:52,970
[SPEAKER_07]: So I really would like to get an opinion from the solicitor.

1034
01:21:53,490 --> 01:21:55,270
[SPEAKER_11]: So is this a motion to table?

1035
01:21:55,310 --> 01:21:55,710
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it is.

1036
01:21:56,111 --> 01:21:59,912
[SPEAKER_11]: So on the motion of Councilor Langley-Curran to table this matter until the-

1037
01:22:09,068 --> 01:22:13,949
[SPEAKER_11]: And under that motion to postpone this matter indefinitely by Councilor Knight.

1038
01:22:14,209 --> 01:22:14,969
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

1039
01:22:15,869 --> 01:22:16,329
[SPEAKER_11]: Opposed?

1040
01:22:16,609 --> 01:22:17,290
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion carries.

1041
01:22:19,710 --> 01:22:20,110
[SPEAKER_11]: Records.

1042
01:22:25,851 --> 01:22:27,532
[SPEAKER_11]: We are all done with those matters, sir.

1043
01:22:28,992 --> 01:22:30,492
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you done for the entire meeting?

1044
01:22:31,012 --> 01:22:31,292
[SPEAKER_09]: We are.

1045
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:31,772
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1046
01:22:31,792 --> 01:22:34,073
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause it says on the back page, public participation.

1047
01:22:34,113 --> 01:22:35,113
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't hear you announce that.

1048
01:22:36,228 --> 01:22:38,650
[SPEAKER_09]: Are we allowed to speak at the end of the meeting before it ends?

1049
01:22:38,670 --> 01:22:47,416
[SPEAKER_09]: It says public participation before you check on your records.

1050
01:22:54,484 --> 01:23:01,590
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a process by which one participates by petitioning the current clerk to speak on a matter.

1051
01:23:02,211 --> 01:23:02,451
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1052
01:23:02,471 --> 01:23:05,694
[SPEAKER_20]: So I move suspension of the rules, Mr. President, to allow the gentleman to speak.

1053
01:23:05,834 --> 01:23:11,518
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Marks moves suspension of the rules on your behalf that you might be allowed to speak on a matter.

1054
01:23:11,819 --> 01:23:13,380
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Dello Russo.

1055
01:23:13,700 --> 01:23:14,821
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor.

1056
01:23:17,904 --> 01:23:20,226
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, Andrew Castagnetti, Cushion Street, 02155.

1057
01:23:22,732 --> 01:23:33,336
[SPEAKER_09]: I simply wanted to please allow me to congratulate you, the reelected city councilors, especially the two new city councilors, JC Falco jr.

1058
01:23:33,536 --> 01:23:35,617
[SPEAKER_09]: And GA Scarpelli.

1059
01:23:36,177 --> 01:23:48,202
[SPEAKER_09]: And also kudos, the new first ever elected female Mrs. Mayor Stephanie Muccini Burke and Mr. Finn and Mr. LaPore.

1060
01:23:51,855 --> 01:24:01,018
[SPEAKER_09]: Let us all work together and make this a good 2016 and a great new year and make Medford greater again.

1061
01:24:02,659 --> 01:24:15,843
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, I have my agenda from last Christmas, and I'd like to give everybody a heads up six months in advance before the budget meeting and before the real estate tax rate is set 12 months from today.

1062
01:24:17,364 --> 01:24:21,665
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully, Santa Claus will be good to us this December.

1063
01:24:22,450 --> 01:24:32,318
[SPEAKER_09]: and finally give our middle-class homeowners some real estate tax relief if they live in their house as an owner-occupied dweller.

1064
01:24:33,639 --> 01:24:38,542
[SPEAKER_09]: As you know, the best time to prepare for this is at budget time in June.

1065
01:24:39,883 --> 01:24:51,092
[SPEAKER_09]: Then we will be ready, able, and hopefully willing to adopt the full 20 percent owner-occupied real estate tax exemption under

1066
01:24:52,254 --> 01:24:57,775
[SPEAKER_09]: Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 56, Section 5C.

1067
01:24:58,376 --> 01:25:01,296
[SPEAKER_09]: I can repeat that if you want to write this down six months in advance.

1068
01:25:02,377 --> 01:25:09,158
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Massachusetts MGL, Chapter 56, Section 5C.

1069
01:25:10,259 --> 01:25:12,979
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for your attention, and I wish us all a healthy Good New Year's.

1070
01:25:13,499 --> 01:25:13,900
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1071
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:14,800
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for your help.

1072
01:25:15,460 --> 01:25:15,960
[SPEAKER_11]: Congratulations.

1073
01:25:15,980 --> 01:25:17,000
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. Castagnetti.

1074
01:25:18,721 --> 01:25:19,201
[SPEAKER_11]: The records.

1075
01:25:21,491 --> 01:25:25,354
[SPEAKER_11]: of the December 22nd, 2015 meeting were passed to Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

1076
01:25:25,834 --> 01:25:27,835
[SPEAKER_11]: Madam Vice President, how do you find those records?

1077
01:25:30,577 --> 01:25:33,639
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion for approval by Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

1078
01:25:33,659 --> 01:25:34,480
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

1079
01:25:35,080 --> 01:25:35,761
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

1080
01:25:36,201 --> 01:25:36,941
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion carries.

1081
01:25:37,782 --> 01:25:38,623
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to adjourn.

1082
01:25:42,248 --> 01:25:42,468
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

1083
01:25:42,668 --> 01:25:58,980
[SPEAKER_20]: Uh, and, uh, the clerk at Finn was nice enough to forward, uh, recently, uh, uh, correspondence from, uh, governor Baker regarding a number of potential amendments, uh, to mass general law that would impact local cities and towns.

1084
01:25:59,620 --> 01:26:03,503
[SPEAKER_20]: And there had to be 40, 50 pages of potential amendments.

1085
01:26:04,153 --> 01:26:05,714
[SPEAKER_20]: And I just happened to go through some.

1086
01:26:06,054 --> 01:26:06,895
[SPEAKER_20]: Some I agreed with.

1087
01:26:06,935 --> 01:26:08,596
[SPEAKER_20]: Some I think need more discussion.

1088
01:26:09,037 --> 01:26:09,957
[SPEAKER_20]: Some I didn't agree with.

1089
01:26:10,317 --> 01:26:33,494
[SPEAKER_20]: But I think it's appropriate that this body, at some point — these have not been enacted, but maybe as a body we should look at some of these and see which ones we would like to pursue and push forward, because there are many valid issues in there regarding election law, regarding the Treasurer-Collector's Office, regarding the city charter and the operation of how cities work and run.

1090
01:26:34,230 --> 01:26:38,013
[SPEAKER_20]: And it may be worthwhile that we have a committee of the whole meeting or a subcommittee.

1091
01:26:38,133 --> 01:26:39,875
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm amenable to anything.

1092
01:26:40,255 --> 01:26:55,488
[SPEAKER_20]: But I think it's worthwhile because a lot of emphasis was put in it by the governor and his staff and based on countless recommendations from this entire commonwealth on how to streamline and improve city government.

1093
01:26:56,228 --> 01:26:58,610
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think it would be worthwhile, Mr. President.

1094
01:26:58,630 --> 01:26:58,950
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1095
01:26:59,951 --> 01:27:01,252
[SPEAKER_11]: So we will work on that.

1096
01:27:02,273 --> 01:27:07,658
[SPEAKER_11]: And we will give ourselves all a chance to look at those regulations.

1097
01:27:08,178 --> 01:27:11,841
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we'll call the Committee of the Whole and maybe discuss it broadly.

1098
01:27:12,041 --> 01:27:20,989
[SPEAKER_11]: And then there, decide on how we want to, once we've had a chance to look at everything, perhaps decide how to move further from there.

1099
01:27:21,009 --> 01:27:26,413
[SPEAKER_11]: So on the motion for adjournment, by Councilor.

1100
01:27:26,674 --> 01:27:27,354
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

1101
01:27:27,795 --> 01:27:28,495
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

1102
01:27:28,936 --> 01:27:29,676
[SPEAKER_11]: Meeting is adjourned.

1103
01:27:29,716 --> 01:27:30,217
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you all.
