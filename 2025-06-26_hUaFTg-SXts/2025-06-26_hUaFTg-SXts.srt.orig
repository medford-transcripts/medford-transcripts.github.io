47
00:02:44,587 --> 00:02:49,849
[SPEAKER_05]: You just can't vote on material as of right now, but you can vote to continue, I believe.

48
00:02:53,046 --> 00:02:54,487
[SPEAKER_05]: And myself, Jackie McPherson.

49
00:02:56,669 --> 00:03:02,774
[SPEAKER_05]: So the next item, we're going to go to 294 Harvard Street.

50
00:03:04,455 --> 00:03:11,421
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a special permit to establish a motor vehicle repair establishment, which is auto glass within an existing building.

51
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:16,265
[SPEAKER_05]: This was continued from 313.4 as well, I believe.

52
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:17,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that the date?

53
00:03:17,746 --> 00:03:19,588
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have to continue this date.

54
00:03:20,605 --> 00:03:25,467
[SPEAKER_05]: And if I can have the Method staff introduce the proponent again.

55
00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:34,732
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe the property owner, Darren Danucci, is present on the call.

56
00:03:37,293 --> 00:03:39,594
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll unmute.

57
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:45,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Darren, I'm not sure if anyone from... Hi, can you hear me now?

58
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:46,697
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

59
00:03:47,198 --> 00:03:47,618
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, thanks.

60
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:56,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Through the chair, Darren, do you have anybody joining you tonight on this matter?

61
00:03:56,173 --> 00:03:56,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Just me.

62
00:03:56,373 --> 00:03:56,733
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

63
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:05,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, so through the chair, just a reminder, the last meeting, there was a typo on the agenda.

64
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:22,398
[SPEAKER_03]: So out of abundance of caution, we continued this in order to make sure that it was properly noticed on the agenda to ensure that anyone from the public that was looking to speak on this

65
00:04:24,795 --> 00:04:26,816
[SPEAKER_03]: would be able to speak tonight.

66
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:35,640
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would recommend that you open up for public comment and then deliberation.

67
00:04:41,037 --> 00:04:43,858
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that said, I will open the public comment period.

68
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:48,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Danielle in the comments.

69
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:52,643
[SPEAKER_05]: You can also send an email to OCD at method-ma.gov.

70
00:04:53,183 --> 00:04:56,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.

71
00:04:56,804 --> 00:05:02,987
[SPEAKER_05]: A reminder to all meeting participants to please refrain from using the chat function to provide comments as it is not part of the public record.

72
00:05:03,508 --> 00:05:10,231
[SPEAKER_05]: However, if a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, this may be entered into the chat to let myself and staff

73
00:05:12,616 --> 00:05:17,097
[SPEAKER_05]: Danielle, can you please manage the public comment queue and read any previously sent emails or letters?

74
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:24,959
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see any hands raised.

75
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,740
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't received any comments on this one.

76
00:05:37,342 --> 00:05:41,903
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so in that case, I will close the public comment period for this meeting.

77
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:59,439
[SPEAKER_05]: And to remind the board, I remember we were mostly in agreement, but due to the technical error, we were not able to vote at the last meeting, but we said that if the proponent came back, we would be willing to approve with a couple of conditions.

78
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:02,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Condition one being to remove the barbed wire on the fence.

79
00:06:02,752 --> 00:06:06,454
[SPEAKER_05]: maintain screening on the fence to ensure parking is not visible from the public way.

80
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:10,076
[SPEAKER_05]: The proponent was actually amenable to that condition.

81
00:06:10,316 --> 00:06:16,739
[SPEAKER_05]: Condition two, prior to applying for a sign permit, the applicant must submit plans to planning staff for review approval.

82
00:06:17,299 --> 00:06:22,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Preferred signage type would be downcast lighting, such as gooseneck, or halo-lit channel letters.

83
00:06:23,622 --> 00:06:26,203
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe the proponent was amenable to that as well.

84
00:06:28,004 --> 00:06:30,645
[SPEAKER_05]: Condition number three, strike parking, the same.

85
00:06:33,162 --> 00:06:42,264
[SPEAKER_05]: And I believe, I'm not sure that we have to go over the benefits of this, making sure that the benefits outweigh any adverse effects as we've done that.

86
00:06:43,404 --> 00:06:48,465
[SPEAKER_05]: So at this point, I'm not sure if the board has any further questions.

87
00:06:48,525 --> 00:06:57,107
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to move forward with, if I can have an actual motion to approve

88
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:03,124
[SPEAKER_05]: the site plan for 94 Harvard Street, if there are no other questions.

89
00:07:11,391 --> 00:07:19,557
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's everything I had in town.

90
00:07:19,777 --> 00:07:25,722
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, we were ready to approve with condition or to grant with conditions that we

91
00:07:26,667 --> 00:07:28,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Couldn't vote because of the technical thing.

92
00:07:30,609 --> 00:07:37,674
[SPEAKER_02]: In that case, I'll motion to grant the special permit with conditions as noted.

93
00:07:38,394 --> 00:07:38,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Seconded.

94
00:07:41,936 --> 00:07:43,237
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice Chair Emily Hedeman?

95
00:07:43,817 --> 00:07:43,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

96
00:07:44,878 --> 00:07:45,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Peter Cowles?

97
00:07:46,419 --> 00:07:46,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

98
00:07:47,219 --> 00:07:47,940
[SPEAKER_05]: Ari Fishman?

99
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:48,980
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

100
00:07:49,661 --> 00:07:50,501
[SPEAKER_05]: Pam Ariansky?

101
00:07:50,521 --> 00:07:51,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

102
00:07:52,082 --> 00:07:52,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Sally Kiki?

103
00:07:53,631 --> 00:07:54,351
[SPEAKER_04]: or I can't vote?

104
00:07:54,952 --> 00:07:56,993
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yes, that's right.

105
00:07:57,133 --> 00:08:00,115
[SPEAKER_05]: Abstention and myself, Jackie McPherson, I'm an aye.

106
00:08:02,736 --> 00:08:03,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Tanuchi.

107
00:08:03,897 --> 00:08:06,398
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe your special permit has been granted.

108
00:08:06,418 --> 00:08:09,020
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank everybody very much.

109
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Tanuchi.

110
00:08:11,761 --> 00:08:13,262
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your patience.

111
00:08:14,102 --> 00:08:16,103
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see you around town.

112
00:08:16,644 --> 00:08:16,864
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.

113
00:08:18,315 --> 00:08:21,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Next up on our agenda is 48 to 64 Commercial Street.

114
00:08:21,897 --> 00:08:29,162
[SPEAKER_05]: This is site plan review to construct a two-story 97,857 square foot research and testing lab.

115
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:37,668
[SPEAKER_05]: Danielle, can you please introduce, oh, can you actually give any introductory comments to remind us of this item?

116
00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:47,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, so at the last meeting, we opened the public hearing and heard the presentation from the applicant.

117
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:51,737
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe everyone was largely in favor of it.

118
00:08:51,777 --> 00:09:01,344
[SPEAKER_03]: There were just some technical things that needed to be updated on the plans so that it was a nice, clean approval without too many conditions.

119
00:09:03,145 --> 00:09:08,829
[SPEAKER_03]: In the interim, I did receive the updated plans and transmitted those to you all.

120
00:09:10,931 --> 00:09:14,553
[SPEAKER_03]: I ran it by the city engineer and the director of traffic and parking.

121
00:09:16,237 --> 00:09:18,839
[SPEAKER_03]: were some revisions that still need to be made.

122
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:32,686
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that they are straightforward enough that we could add those as conditions rather than continue the hearing.

123
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:37,249
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of those was from the city engineer.

124
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:43,312
[SPEAKER_03]: He had requested that both entrances have concrete

125
00:09:45,143 --> 00:09:50,707
[SPEAKER_03]: drive aprons so that it reads as a driveway, not as a road.

126
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:53,789
[SPEAKER_03]: So a continuous sidewalk.

127
00:09:55,130 --> 00:10:11,322
[SPEAKER_03]: And then director of traffic and transportation comments or surrounding some of the off-property traffic.

128
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:15,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Mitigation with sidewalks.

129
00:10:15,322 --> 00:10:16,725
[SPEAKER_03]: I can call up the email.

130
00:10:16,765 --> 00:10:18,929
[SPEAKER_03]: I got it this afternoon.

131
00:10:18,949 --> 00:10:22,236
[SPEAKER_03]: But I will turn it over to attorney dash.

132
00:10:25,506 --> 00:10:26,346
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Danielle.

133
00:10:26,486 --> 00:10:30,867
[SPEAKER_01]: Adam Dash, 48 Grove Street in Somerville, representing Empire Management Corporation.

134
00:10:30,927 --> 00:10:46,071
[SPEAKER_01]: With me are Bernard Gibbons from Empire, James Almonte from the Civil Engineers and Landscape Architects, Patrick Bradley, our Traffic Engineer, Mary Lou Armstrong from Theta Group, who's our Licensed Site Professional for Environmental Matters.

135
00:10:48,251 --> 00:10:59,601
[SPEAKER_01]: When we were before you on the 19th of March regarding the project that requires site plan review for a non residential structure of over 10,000 square feet, which will be this tough tech lab building.

136
00:11:00,161 --> 00:11:02,683
[SPEAKER_01]: We already have our ZBA height variants.

137
00:11:02,723 --> 00:11:06,326
[SPEAKER_01]: If you recall, we can James, you want to pull up the.

138
00:11:07,527 --> 00:11:08,007
[SPEAKER_01]: slides.

139
00:11:08,107 --> 00:11:09,768
[SPEAKER_01]: James is going to drive our slides tonight.

140
00:11:09,808 --> 00:11:15,532
[SPEAKER_01]: I can real quickly recap what we went through just so it's fresh in your mind, and then show you what we've changed.

141
00:11:16,192 --> 00:11:21,296
[SPEAKER_01]: We did get some comments, as Danielle said, today from traffic and from engineering.

142
00:11:21,376 --> 00:11:23,657
[SPEAKER_01]: None of them are major or earth-shattering.

143
00:11:23,697 --> 00:11:27,840
[SPEAKER_01]: We obviously, getting them today, we were not able to incorporate them in the plans that you've seen.

144
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,220
[SPEAKER_01]: However,

145
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,502
[SPEAKER_01]: We would appreciate a vote and can have those as conditions, as Danielle suggested, I think makes eminent sense.

146
00:11:34,022 --> 00:11:36,583
[SPEAKER_01]: But we can certainly discuss what's going to happen here.

147
00:11:37,283 --> 00:11:40,884
[SPEAKER_00]: James, if somebody can just allow me to share the screen.

148
00:11:40,904 --> 00:11:43,965
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you have to make him a co-host.

149
00:11:44,886 --> 00:11:46,126
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.

150
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:53,149
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to zip through some slides so you remember what you have.

151
00:11:53,169 --> 00:11:55,049
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if everybody was here last time anyway.

152
00:11:58,099 --> 00:11:59,680
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the slide that's going to set the list.

153
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:03,063
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to, James, go through what we've changed since the last time we saw everybody here?

154
00:12:03,843 --> 00:12:04,123
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

155
00:12:04,904 --> 00:12:14,290
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the comments was the addition of an erosion and sediment control plan, which we did add to the revised plan set, which is shown here.

156
00:12:15,751 --> 00:12:17,693
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a new plan that was added to the set.

157
00:12:19,253 --> 00:12:21,315
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is the layout materials plan.

158
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:23,857
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the changes are shown on this plan.

159
00:12:24,418 --> 00:12:30,283
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the big changes was the addition of the landscape islands within the parking lot.

160
00:12:30,423 --> 00:12:34,287
[SPEAKER_00]: So we didn't have more than 25 spaces in a row.

161
00:12:34,907 --> 00:12:37,990
[SPEAKER_00]: So we added islands here, here.

162
00:12:38,751 --> 00:12:43,635
[SPEAKER_00]: This one wasn't needed from a parking lot standpoint, but we needed it from a drainage standpoint.

163
00:12:43,815 --> 00:12:45,016
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we added another one here.

164
00:12:46,037 --> 00:12:50,461
[SPEAKER_00]: So that resulted in the net loss of three spaces.

165
00:12:50,501 --> 00:12:54,844
[SPEAKER_00]: We did add a couple spaces in the back to try to make up for a few that we lost.

166
00:12:55,905 --> 00:12:59,187
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're at 211 spaces down from 214.

167
00:13:00,588 --> 00:13:04,691
[SPEAKER_00]: So a few less employees allowed for this type of use.

168
00:13:05,992 --> 00:13:13,318
[SPEAKER_00]: We also added one accessible EV space, which I believe was a comment from the traffic department.

169
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:21,721
[SPEAKER_00]: We eliminated the retaining wall for a couple of reasons along the South property line.

170
00:13:21,741 --> 00:13:26,723
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a comment from the abutter and also from conservation.

171
00:13:26,803 --> 00:13:33,404
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were able to pull the parking away from the wetland line and able to off grade that.

172
00:13:33,504 --> 00:13:35,685
[SPEAKER_00]: So that moved a little bit further away from the wetland.

173
00:13:37,653 --> 00:13:47,036
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the comments that I think are still outstanding that Danielle mentioned was the curb cut along commercial street.

174
00:13:49,057 --> 00:13:55,619
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there was talk about having this bump out here and then transitioning back to the wider width within commercial street.

175
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:05,363
[SPEAKER_00]: What we ended up doing is we did the bump out, but we did transition back, but we allow for some potential on-street parking.

176
00:14:07,224 --> 00:14:25,677
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the changes if that's not something that the city wants to see then we'll just transition this curving back to match the, the wider width of commercial street and will eliminate those nine parallel spaces that we have within the right of way so that's, that's a relatively easy fix.

177
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:36,529
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so we moved if you recall, we had the sidewalk going across our driveway and this also relates to 1 of the comments that the city engineer made.

178
00:14:37,809 --> 00:14:49,092
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did have a sidewalk that ran across this driveway, which makes sense when you, when you have that apron, and then it crossed over a commercial street on the South side of that driveway.

179
00:14:49,892 --> 00:14:53,053
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we eliminated that crossing across our driveway.

180
00:14:53,614 --> 00:14:57,895
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we eliminated the apron and we move the crosswalk to the North side of that intersection.

181
00:14:58,556 --> 00:14:59,776
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you're crossing here.

182
00:14:59,796 --> 00:15:07,299
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then 1 of the other comments was to add another crossing here, which, which we can do as well, or have it conditioned as part of the approval.

183
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:13,562
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we also added an accessible ramp on the South side of commercial street there.

184
00:15:17,081 --> 00:15:22,864
[SPEAKER_00]: There was some comments on native plantings, just the drainage plan.

185
00:15:23,985 --> 00:15:32,489
[SPEAKER_00]: There were some comments from the engineer from stormwater that you really don't see on this plan, but we did submit revised stormwater accounts to that department as well.

186
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:44,374
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we did change some of the tree species to native species, which was another comment that we received from, I believe, from conservation and from this board.

187
00:15:44,934 --> 00:15:47,797
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did swap out a couple of those trees to being native species.

188
00:15:47,837 --> 00:15:53,141
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the other ones were already native, so we only had to change out a few of those.

189
00:15:55,086 --> 00:16:23,773
[SPEAKER_00]: think I think that was the pedestrian walkway I'm sorry what was that pedestrian walkway James oh yeah the so we did meet with the butter one last time and we did we did angle this connection this pedestrian connection back from the to the shopping center we had a tying in going straight up the page they just wanted that angled to the left there's actually we actually have an access easement on their property they just wanted us to

190
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:26,294
[SPEAKER_00]: tie that into our access easement.

191
00:16:26,934 --> 00:16:31,176
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was just simply angling it from going straight up the page to turning it to the left.

192
00:16:31,836 --> 00:16:34,958
[SPEAKER_00]: So not a major change there, but it's something that they wanted to see.

193
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:42,521
[SPEAKER_01]: The shopping center very much wanted the pedestrian connection, as you can imagine.

194
00:16:42,641 --> 00:16:48,203
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just a matter of finessing it, how it connects to their property, which is not a big deal.

195
00:16:50,474 --> 00:16:58,140
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless I think there was a couple other minor comments that we got in some of the, some of the comments that we received from the city.

196
00:16:58,701 --> 00:17:02,184
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, the stormwater, nothing that you really see on the plan.

197
00:17:02,244 --> 00:17:06,647
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just how we did some calculations that we, that we addressed their comments on.

198
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,011
[SPEAKER_00]: And some utility connections as well.

199
00:17:11,051 --> 00:17:15,074
[SPEAKER_00]: We added a hydrant at the back of the site and within the parking lot.

200
00:17:15,114 --> 00:17:17,096
[SPEAKER_00]: That was another comment that we received.

201
00:17:20,755 --> 00:17:30,162
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we've pretty much met everything and then the comments that came in today, James just described how we could address those via condition and we're happy to address them.

202
00:17:30,202 --> 00:17:34,164
[SPEAKER_01]: None of them are substantive to the project as far as we're concerned and happy to oblige.

203
00:17:42,588 --> 00:17:44,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Monti and Attorney Dash.

204
00:17:45,089 --> 00:17:52,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Daniel, can you remind the board of, so I don't see updated comments from the department head, so can you lay those conditions out again?

205
00:17:52,652 --> 00:18:06,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's clear that the plans have been updated, and I feel a lot more comfortable, because as I said previously, when you condition something to the point of change, we should definitely see more of a final.

206
00:18:06,778 --> 00:18:10,340
[SPEAKER_05]: And this definitely looks a lot more final, so I want to be clear on what the,

207
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:22,525
[SPEAKER_05]: Updated comments are what has not been addressed If you can spell it out for the board Yeah, so, um We'll need a condition.

208
00:18:22,545 --> 00:18:34,251
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean it is the applicant is amenable to this i'm assuming um the let's see what we find the Exact language from

209
00:18:39,145 --> 00:18:47,871
[SPEAKER_03]: city engineers about the concrete apron or I'll make sure I'm using the right language.

210
00:18:50,193 --> 00:18:51,574
[SPEAKER_01]: James might be able to go straight to it.

211
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:53,395
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I can.

212
00:18:53,756 --> 00:19:00,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah the engineering division recommends that both entrances to the site be concrete driveway apron in accordance with city standards.

213
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:05,344
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is the

214
00:19:09,062 --> 00:19:12,743
[SPEAKER_03]: only remaining condition that we would need for engineering.

215
00:19:12,763 --> 00:19:21,967
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I believe Todd's comments were the same.

216
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:34,331
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll address it with the exception that was just detailed.

217
00:19:34,531 --> 00:19:38,353
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would recommend that a condition be that

218
00:19:39,245 --> 00:19:51,178
[SPEAKER_03]: that the applicant admit a revised plan, I guess it would be, would it be C-101, would it be this, would this be the only plan affected?

219
00:19:51,218 --> 00:19:53,261
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess this is a question for the engineering.

220
00:19:57,357 --> 00:20:00,780
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yeah, I think that this plan should cover everything.

221
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:06,864
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so it was just basically making this driveway mimic this one.

222
00:20:07,044 --> 00:20:10,526
[SPEAKER_00]: So having that concrete apron go across this driveway here.

223
00:20:12,448 --> 00:20:15,570
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the change to the curbing along Commercial Street.

224
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,952
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we can cover everything on this plan.

225
00:20:21,834 --> 00:20:26,438
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the second condition would be the curbing on Commercial Street, the bump out

226
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:38,148
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it looks like all the buyer comments were incorporated with the additional hydrants.

227
00:20:47,695 --> 00:20:57,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the only conditions that I think are necessary from my end to satisfy traffic and engineering.

228
00:20:57,021 --> 00:21:00,924
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if there are any others.

229
00:21:02,608 --> 00:21:06,851
[SPEAKER_01]: James, I think those are the only two that we weren't that came in today that we weren't able to incorporate on the plan.

230
00:21:07,252 --> 00:21:07,552
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?

231
00:21:08,532 --> 00:21:10,374
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's all I had.

232
00:21:12,736 --> 00:21:16,198
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just have one question about through the chair about the pedestrian connection.

233
00:21:16,258 --> 00:21:17,619
[SPEAKER_03]: So is there a gate?

234
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:18,900
[SPEAKER_03]: It will always be open.

235
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:22,823
[SPEAKER_03]: It will be obvious that you can get through there.

236
00:21:22,843 --> 00:21:26,726
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it won't be gated.

237
00:21:27,066 --> 00:21:27,667
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be open.

238
00:21:28,613 --> 00:21:32,677
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only change that we made here was the sidewalk continues straight through.

239
00:21:32,697 --> 00:21:38,422
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was basically right in front of their gas pump.

240
00:21:38,462 --> 00:21:41,164
[SPEAKER_00]: So they just wanted that angle to the left.

241
00:21:41,565 --> 00:21:48,931
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't show on this plan, it's off the survey, but it actually ties into one of their islands in their parking lot.

242
00:21:48,951 --> 00:21:50,993
[SPEAKER_00]: So it actually makes sense to do that.

243
00:21:52,335 --> 00:21:54,777
[SPEAKER_00]: But it won't be gated, it'll be open at all times.

244
00:21:59,153 --> 00:21:59,413
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

245
00:22:00,853 --> 00:22:04,694
[SPEAKER_03]: And Madam Chair, I see that Vice Chair Emily Hedeman has her hand raised.

246
00:22:05,314 --> 00:22:06,515
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Vice Chair Hedeman.

247
00:22:08,115 --> 00:22:09,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, Chair McPherson.

248
00:22:09,555 --> 00:22:16,297
[SPEAKER_06]: Focusing on that northwest corner again, what's the elevation of that?

249
00:22:16,317 --> 00:22:20,358
[SPEAKER_06]: I couldn't really read the writing there, the concrete utility thing.

250
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:22,143
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

251
00:22:22,984 --> 00:22:24,665
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so let's go to the dreams.

252
00:22:25,606 --> 00:22:27,227
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's at elevation 12 ish.

253
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:29,529
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a 12 contour going right through the middle of it.

254
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:30,290
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

255
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:34,873
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it like, um, is there like a structure?

256
00:22:35,133 --> 00:22:36,234
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no.

257
00:22:36,514 --> 00:22:36,755
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

258
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,856
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a retaining wall.

259
00:22:38,876 --> 00:22:38,956
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

260
00:22:38,976 --> 00:22:44,040
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be a concrete pad retaining wall and then a privacy fence around it to screen it.

261
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:46,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

262
00:22:46,042 --> 00:22:51,046
[SPEAKER_06]: So if someone was to go to the other site, they'd, they'd have to squeeze kind of through,

263
00:22:51,921 --> 00:22:53,502
[SPEAKER_06]: that little area next to it?

264
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:55,444
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

265
00:22:55,944 --> 00:22:56,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

266
00:22:56,565 --> 00:22:58,446
[SPEAKER_00]: The sidewalk would run right adjacent to it.

267
00:22:59,287 --> 00:22:59,527
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

268
00:22:59,567 --> 00:23:04,271
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use, but yeah, there's a sidewalk.

269
00:23:04,291 --> 00:23:04,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

270
00:23:05,031 --> 00:23:19,483
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I wonder if we could, um, add a condition to add signage there, uh, just to like better indicate that that is a pass through.

271
00:23:20,052 --> 00:23:25,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I'm just thinking about myself as a user of buildings.

272
00:23:26,496 --> 00:23:29,437
[SPEAKER_06]: You really have to know that that's there to go there.

273
00:23:29,457 --> 00:23:38,502
[SPEAKER_06]: I think a sign would be helpful just to say, shopping this way or whatever.

274
00:23:42,184 --> 00:23:43,325
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that something that we could condition?

275
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,991
[SPEAKER_03]: through the chair, yes, I believe so.

276
00:23:50,411 --> 00:23:58,974
[SPEAKER_03]: So you could, yeah, no, it makes sense to do that now to condition that there be some directional signage there.

277
00:23:59,074 --> 00:24:04,076
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's no question when they apply for a sign permit that it wasn't already blessed.

278
00:24:05,596 --> 00:24:06,597
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, nothing too crazy.

279
00:24:06,637 --> 00:24:09,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Just, you know, part of your standard, you know, exterior sign package.

280
00:24:11,419 --> 00:24:13,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, like whatever the name of that shopping center is like.

281
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:16,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's like two hills by Plaza or something.

282
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:16,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

283
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:17,281
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

284
00:24:18,241 --> 00:24:27,243
[SPEAKER_06]: And it wouldn't have to be in the other direction because I, I don't know how big the draw would be, um, from the shopping Plaza to the, to this, um, commercial building.

285
00:24:27,263 --> 00:24:27,403
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

286
00:24:27,423 --> 00:24:30,924
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be a huge draw.

287
00:24:32,384 --> 00:24:38,046
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, maybe like, you know, you know, depending on people's route, but I think, you know,

288
00:24:39,374 --> 00:24:41,075
[SPEAKER_06]: providing a little bit of signage would be nice.

289
00:24:41,095 --> 00:24:42,295
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that makes sense.

290
00:24:43,395 --> 00:24:43,595
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.

291
00:24:49,837 --> 00:24:56,999
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

292
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:02,801
[SPEAKER_05]: Since it is part of a hearing, we'll need a public comment.

293
00:25:04,401 --> 00:25:05,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that correct, Daniel, for this one?

294
00:25:07,822 --> 00:25:13,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you didn't close the public hearing, so you can ask if there's anybody tonight who wants to speak on this.

295
00:25:15,886 --> 00:25:17,727
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so I'll open up.

296
00:25:17,987 --> 00:25:20,268
[SPEAKER_07]: Madam Chair, one of the members has their hand raised.

297
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:22,770
[SPEAKER_07]: Peter Cowles.

298
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:23,770
[SPEAKER_07]: Peter Cowles.

299
00:25:25,751 --> 00:25:36,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, just to the question on one of the potential conditions, the curb on Commercial Street, what is that condition specifically referring to?

300
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:46,611
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard it referred to both by city staff and by the engineer, and I'm just not sure what it's referring to.

301
00:25:49,994 --> 00:25:51,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have access to your email right now, Peter?

302
00:25:51,976 --> 00:25:58,342
[SPEAKER_03]: I just forwarded you the entire board, the email that I received from Todd today.

303
00:25:59,527 --> 00:26:01,228
[SPEAKER_03]: I can also read it if that's easier.

304
00:26:01,948 --> 00:26:03,449
[SPEAKER_03]: My comments generally are as follows.

305
00:26:03,509 --> 00:26:07,771
[SPEAKER_03]: The project responded to the suggestion to bump out the north side of their south driveway.

306
00:26:08,112 --> 00:26:10,433
[SPEAKER_03]: However, they also bumped out their entire frontage.

307
00:26:10,853 --> 00:26:18,757
[SPEAKER_03]: The intent of my comment was to extend the narrow portion of the road only one driveway further north to accommodate better pedestrian exiting sight lines.

308
00:26:20,098 --> 00:26:27,602
[SPEAKER_03]: The road north of this driveway crosswalk should remain wider to transition to the cross section that exists to the north of the south driveway.

309
00:26:28,875 --> 00:26:41,978
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, if proceeding with the bump out for the crosswalk to cross on the north side of the Commercial slash Blake intersection, then the project should also construct new ramps crossing Blake, which are not shown, indicated.

310
00:26:42,418 --> 00:26:48,579
[SPEAKER_03]: If not, the pedestrian path from their frontage to continue south on Commercial will not be fully accessible to all users.

311
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:50,400
[SPEAKER_03]: So,

312
00:26:51,730 --> 00:27:04,279
[SPEAKER_03]: We could condition an updated plan that incorporates all of Director Blake's comments and then for review and approval.

313
00:27:04,299 --> 00:27:06,160
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

314
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:13,425
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the language that he had maybe was misinterpreted or not fully.

315
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:13,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

316
00:27:14,587 --> 00:27:14,967
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine.

317
00:27:14,987 --> 00:27:21,468
[SPEAKER_02]: I just was looking at the meeting materials and the last comments from Director Blake were from the middle of March, so I was confused.

318
00:27:22,428 --> 00:27:23,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they just came in today.

319
00:27:23,649 --> 00:27:26,549
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, gotcha.

320
00:27:26,629 --> 00:27:30,650
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted them to see the revised plans and see if it captured everything.

321
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:42,652
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there any other comments from the board?

322
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:50,786
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, since we haven't closed the public hearing, I will open it up for public comment.

323
00:27:51,407 --> 00:27:55,668
[SPEAKER_05]: Those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Daniel in the comments.

324
00:27:55,688 --> 00:28:00,470
[SPEAKER_05]: You can also send an email to OCD at Medford-MA.gov.

325
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:03,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.

326
00:28:04,092 --> 00:28:07,533
[SPEAKER_05]: A reminder to all meeting participants to please refrain from using the chat function.

327
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:10,195
[SPEAKER_05]: to provide comments as it's not part of the public record.

328
00:28:10,615 --> 00:28:17,161
[SPEAKER_05]: However, if a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, this may be entered into the chat to alert myself and staff.

329
00:28:18,082 --> 00:28:23,426
[SPEAKER_05]: Danielle, have you received any emails or previously sent letters or emails on this?

330
00:28:26,529 --> 00:28:27,209
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I have not.

331
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:28,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Since the last meeting?

332
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:29,511
No.

333
00:28:32,133 --> 00:28:36,597
[SPEAKER_05]: And seeing no hands raised now, I think it's safe to close the public

334
00:28:37,041 --> 00:28:40,465
[SPEAKER_05]: comment period for this meeting and for this item.

335
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:51,078
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll ask if the board has any other questions regarding the criteria for approval or any of the conditions.

336
00:29:02,298 --> 00:29:29,413
[SPEAKER_02]: seeing none so i'm not sure i peter have you captured all the conditions or is it more appropriate to have the city list the conditions with approval i have captured assuming we have the three conditions condition one being to revise the plans to incorporate concrete driveway aprons and continuous sidewalks at both driveways

337
00:29:31,696 --> 00:29:37,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Condition two is the one I'm a little fuzzy on that's based on Director Blake's comments about the curb bump outs.

338
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:40,522
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just not really sure what that's looking for.

339
00:29:40,602 --> 00:29:54,630
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would be one more where I'd say revise the plans in accordance with Director Blake's comments of four, three, and five.

340
00:29:58,442 --> 00:30:08,267
[SPEAKER_02]: In regards to the curb on curbing on commercial street, just because I'm not really sure and looking through that exactly what the condition is for the actual curb itself.

341
00:30:08,327 --> 00:30:20,552
[SPEAKER_02]: And then condition three is the applicant shall install wayfinding signage at the pedestrian connection from the property to Felsway Plaza.

342
00:30:25,325 --> 00:30:28,066
[SPEAKER_05]: And you did mention the concrete apron on the driveway.

343
00:30:28,266 --> 00:30:29,526
[SPEAKER_05]: Was that the first one you mentioned?

344
00:30:29,546 --> 00:30:30,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, that was the first one, yeah.

345
00:30:30,946 --> 00:30:31,326
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

346
00:30:32,766 --> 00:30:35,387
[SPEAKER_05]: And the city is, you're looking for a revised plan.

347
00:30:35,407 --> 00:30:38,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Do the department has want a revised plan?

348
00:30:39,008 --> 00:30:41,728
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not a condition, but that's something that will need to happen.

349
00:30:43,688 --> 00:30:51,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so the condition will read that the applicant shall submit a revised plan

350
00:30:54,141 --> 00:31:07,653
[SPEAKER_03]: at least sheet C101, I believe it was, and any other affected plans incorporating Director Blake's comments.

351
00:31:10,695 --> 00:31:16,140
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we could even cite in the email dated April 3rd, 2024.

352
00:31:24,162 --> 00:31:38,150
[SPEAKER_03]: And that way, when it comes down to reviewing the building application, building permit application or CO, that would point you to knowing that there was an updated plan to refer to.

353
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:50,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, so I can ask for a motion on that, but I want to be absolutely clear on what we're asking for.

354
00:31:50,300 --> 00:32:00,705
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're asking the proponent to prepare a revised plan with the conditions showing, indicating the conditions as per Director Blake's email of which date?

355
00:32:02,366 --> 00:32:04,066
[SPEAKER_05]: April 3rd, 2024, today.

356
00:32:04,086 --> 00:32:12,210
[SPEAKER_05]: April 3rd, 2024, as well as the other two conditions that Peter has read out, which is the concrete apron on driveway,

357
00:32:12,838 --> 00:32:17,280
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the directional signage from the plaza, but.

358
00:32:20,482 --> 00:32:23,683
[SPEAKER_02]: From the property to the plaza, not the other.

359
00:32:27,065 --> 00:32:33,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I have a motion to approve the site plan to 48 to 64 commercial street based on those conditions?

360
00:32:36,209 --> 00:32:37,309
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll make a motion to approve.

361
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:39,350
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

362
00:32:41,331 --> 00:32:42,472

[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, members of the board.

369
00:33:11,854 --> 00:33:13,136
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be great.

370
00:33:13,556 --> 00:33:14,197
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.

371
00:33:14,577 --> 00:33:14,897

00:33:22,985 --> 00:33:25,387
[SPEAKER_05]: The next item is approval of minutes.

377
00:33:27,032 --> 00:33:30,693
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe they were from 3-13-24.

378
00:33:31,333 --> 00:33:34,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I have a motion to approve the meetings from 3-13-24?

379
00:33:34,654 --> 00:33:36,394
[SPEAKER_05]: I second the motion.

00:33:40,775 --> 00:33:41,215
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll second.

381
00:33:41,255 --> 00:33:46,636
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, before we do, my paper says 3-6-24, but I thought I read it for 3-13.

382
00:33:46,736 --> 00:33:49,817
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I have the wrong date?

383
00:34:00,147 --> 00:34:27,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, my dates are off and this I'm trying to find them again 3 13 is what it is in the uh in sharepoint Yeah, it says 3 6 on it, but when I went in draft meetings was something totally different and then When I went I think originally it was 3 6 the meeting but then it got moved to 3 13 Yes

384
00:34:31,032 --> 00:34:31,932
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, open meeting law.

385
00:34:32,092 --> 00:34:32,472
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

386
00:34:33,453 --> 00:34:33,753

[SPEAKER_05]: So I read it.

00:34:49,116 --> 00:34:49,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Peter cows.

401
00:34:50,817 --> 00:34:50,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

402
00:34:51,677 --> 00:34:52,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Ari Fishman.

403
00:34:53,237 --> 00:34:53,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

00:34:53,977 --> 00:34:54,878
[SPEAKER_05]: Pam Marianski.

405
00:34:54,898 --> 00:34:55,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

406
00:34:56,318 --> 00:34:57,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Sally Akiki.

407
00:34:57,078 --> 00:34:57,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

408
00:34:58,879 --> 00:35:00,179
[SPEAKER_05]: And myself, Jackie McPherson.

409
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:00,719
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm an eye.

410
00:35:02,895 --> 00:35:06,698
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the next item is for the city zoning overhaul updates.

411
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:11,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that something to be discussed this evening?

412
00:35:14,924 --> 00:35:21,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Madam chair, I think at the last meeting or the meeting before we decided that we would keep this as a standing agenda item.

413
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:30,737
[SPEAKER_03]: And if time permits, it'll be an opportunity for myself to give an update on where we are at.

414
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:42,798
[SPEAKER_03]: I will turn this over to director hunt, see if she has if there's any new information to share to just timeline or.

415
00:35:46,341 --> 00:35:48,843
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let me, I'm just gonna grab my notes.

416
00:35:48,983 --> 00:35:54,207
[SPEAKER_07]: So we are meeting with the zoning consultant, Emily Ennis-Wheatley.

417
00:35:54,227 --> 00:36:05,377
[SPEAKER_07]: And we are meeting, she is working on both short-term changes and longer, more in-depth changes.

418
00:36:06,437 --> 00:36:15,104
[SPEAKER_07]: I was hoping to have the draft memo from her today to review the one that we looked at with her on Monday.

419
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:20,187
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but I don't I just checked my email as you were calling this item and it's still not in there.

420
00:36:21,048 --> 00:36:23,149
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so hold on 1 second.

421
00:36:23,169 --> 00:36:25,910
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to have to get back to you after I finish this.

422
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:26,551
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

423
00:36:27,091 --> 00:36:28,171
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

424
00:36:28,772 --> 00:36:30,833
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so.

425
00:36:32,922 --> 00:36:39,065
[SPEAKER_07]: It is my hope to have free so it is our goal and then to have for you all that we're going to be sharing.

426
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:43,287
[SPEAKER_07]: When we send this to the city council for public I can send it to you guys as well.

427
00:36:44,108 --> 00:36:49,570
[SPEAKER_07]: With what are the short term things that we're working on, like quick changes.

428
00:36:50,631 --> 00:36:58,655
[SPEAKER_07]: My favorite example right now is that the parking loading code is a separate table from the use table right and

429
00:36:59,095 --> 00:37:00,316
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a code.

430
00:37:00,536 --> 00:37:02,618
[SPEAKER_07]: Why isn't the number just in the use table?

431
00:37:03,058 --> 00:37:09,823
[SPEAKER_07]: So like that's like let's merge those two together into one table without actually changing any of the parking.

432
00:37:10,323 --> 00:37:14,046
[SPEAKER_07]: So then when we go to change the parking, it'll be really clear.

433
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:20,891
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll all be there together so that we can separate the aesthetic changes from the meaningful changes.

434
00:37:21,432 --> 00:37:25,895
[SPEAKER_07]: There are some definitions that we don't have in our zoning that we should have.

435
00:37:26,255 --> 00:37:29,298
[SPEAKER_07]: And so she's giving us some recommended definitions.

436
00:37:30,339 --> 00:37:37,326
[SPEAKER_07]: There are some, some of them are a few, we have a few use types where the language of the name of the use is archaic.

437
00:37:38,267 --> 00:37:43,132
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we actually want to replace that with a more common use, like just language.

438
00:37:44,013 --> 00:37:45,354
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have a few that are

439
00:37:46,175 --> 00:37:47,216
[SPEAKER_07]: badly missing.

440
00:37:47,796 --> 00:37:59,363
[SPEAKER_07]: For example, coffee shops, it has come up recently that we really kind of wanted to approve the use of a coffee shop as a use in a building that came in front of the board.

441
00:37:59,704 --> 00:38:02,385
[SPEAKER_07]: And honestly, I think it was in front of y'all and CBA.

442
00:38:02,946 --> 00:38:04,086
[SPEAKER_07]: But that wasn't a use.

443
00:38:04,406 --> 00:38:10,150
[SPEAKER_07]: It's either eat-in facility, like a dine-in facility, or nothing.

444
00:38:12,031 --> 00:38:19,594
[SPEAKER_07]: So adding a use to the use table like coffee shops, so that it exists so that we can then start to add it into zones.

445
00:38:20,275 --> 00:38:23,776
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are the kinds of things that we're looking at in this first round.

446
00:38:24,897 --> 00:38:38,963
[SPEAKER_07]: The goal is actually to have that memo together and available to the public next week to have a city council subcommittee meeting on it to look at that stuff, and then refer it to the city council and to you all

447
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:41,964
[SPEAKER_07]: over the next several weeks to months.

448
00:38:43,165 --> 00:38:50,468
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mean, our goal is to actually have it adopted before the end of June, these sort of shorter term changes.

449
00:38:51,588 --> 00:39:00,512
[SPEAKER_07]: In the meantime, so you're aware her staff is doing analysis, they are doing some stakeholder interviews,

450
00:39:01,441 --> 00:39:13,687
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of the things that Emily has said she would really like to do is to talk with the planning board, with you all, about things that you would like to see different in the zoning.

451
00:39:14,508 --> 00:39:23,953
[SPEAKER_07]: Rather than like, here are the changes, comment on them, like have an actual conversation about what you'd like to see as she's moving things forward.

452
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:28,476
[SPEAKER_07]: So we would like to get that on your radar and schedule that.

453
00:39:28,957 --> 00:39:41,507
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm also offering to your board and the zoning board, if there's anybody who would like to individually sit down with one of her staff and just sort of talk some things through, you're welcome to do that as well.

454
00:39:41,927 --> 00:39:44,790
[SPEAKER_07]: Just let Danielle or I know and we can arrange for that.

455
00:39:48,744 --> 00:39:51,247
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think I think those are all the short term things.

456
00:39:51,447 --> 00:40:03,140
[SPEAKER_07]: And just I think I should be explicit about this is that we do have a lawyer that is hired as part of her team, Jonathan Silverstein, who has done work in front of this board before for the city.

457
00:40:04,125 --> 00:40:18,550
[SPEAKER_07]: And if as we go through recommending these changes, we're going to have him review all the changes for the legal side of everything, make sure we're not doing anything illegal or in conflict with anything.

458
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:22,151
[SPEAKER_07]: So that is something that we will be reviewing.

459
00:40:22,251 --> 00:40:27,733
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can just be confident that we've that's a piece of Emily's team that we're working on.

460
00:40:30,398 --> 00:40:36,190
[SPEAKER_07]: Danielle, without my notes in front of me, did I hit all the high points, I think?

461
00:40:38,114 --> 00:40:38,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think so.

462
00:40:38,916 --> 00:40:41,461
[SPEAKER_03]: There might be some use table tweaking.

463
00:40:43,102 --> 00:40:52,766
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you already touched on that with the coffee shop adding some additional uses and eliminating some weird dimensional stuff, I think, like the usable open space.

464
00:40:52,806 --> 00:40:53,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you mention that?

465
00:40:54,206 --> 00:40:58,388
[SPEAKER_07]: I have not, and I'm not sure 100% where we settled on that.

466
00:40:59,068 --> 00:41:07,451
[SPEAKER_07]: Medford's definition of usable open space is bizarre and very hard to apply to a building.

467
00:41:08,031 --> 00:41:12,233
[SPEAKER_07]: I have actually sat with developers and the building commissioner and tried to figure out

468
00:41:13,013 --> 00:41:18,076
[SPEAKER_07]: how you would actually determine the usable open space per our definition.

469
00:41:18,677 --> 00:41:33,667
[SPEAKER_07]: So one of the things that we have bandied about is just changing that definition so that the definition of usable open space is kind of more like what is the open space on the property that is usable, right?

470
00:41:34,307 --> 00:41:35,888
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds obvious.

471
00:41:36,228 --> 00:41:36,648
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not.

472
00:41:36,728 --> 00:41:41,790
[SPEAKER_07]: It's things like it has to be at least 10 feet from any residential units.

473
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:44,911
[SPEAKER_07]: It has to be 10 feet from the property line.

474
00:41:45,171 --> 00:41:49,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Like there are all things that like so that it's not the open space.

475
00:41:50,473 --> 00:41:51,533
[SPEAKER_07]: It's weird.

476
00:41:53,034 --> 00:42:02,257
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not even sure what the background in history is, but it feels very old because there was some reference in there to the ability to set up a clothesline.

477
00:42:03,375 --> 00:42:06,676
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so that made us feel that it was really old.

478
00:42:06,696 --> 00:42:26,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so we'll, we'll definitely, we, so what I basically say is that we're very interested in there being some informal conversations either with the board as a whole or individually, in addition to having the zoning changes come in front of you for formal comments to send to the city council.

479
00:42:36,667 --> 00:42:47,875
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so through this year, basically, if there are certain members who are very interested in this and want to be more active in this process, you're more than welcome.

480
00:42:49,396 --> 00:42:55,760
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't want to just be dropping things in front of you on an agenda item, like a rubber stamp or something.

481
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:59,463
[SPEAKER_03]: We value the input of our planning board.

482
00:43:06,252 --> 00:43:07,794
[SPEAKER_05]: I can definitely appreciate that.

483
00:43:08,214 --> 00:43:11,338
[SPEAKER_05]: I have extreme interest, but I'm just trying to figure out.

484
00:43:11,958 --> 00:43:15,742
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to throw a dot at my calendar to see exactly how I can make that happen.

485
00:43:15,982 --> 00:43:18,705
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely the ability.

486
00:43:18,725 --> 00:43:21,208
[SPEAKER_05]: Similarly, I'd love to.

487
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:32,802
[SPEAKER_02]: have that conversation, but I need to figure out when to do that.

488
00:43:33,603 --> 00:43:43,369
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that's part of why I'm saying like, if people want to have a one off conversation, then we can be very accommodating to your schedules.

489
00:43:44,549 --> 00:43:52,134
[SPEAKER_07]: As opposed to, you know, we'll have to make a longer CD board meeting or a special one to meet with her.

490
00:43:52,154 --> 00:43:52,954
[SPEAKER_07]: So

491
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:57,621
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's hard to predict.

492
00:43:58,221 --> 00:44:03,463
[SPEAKER_07]: Tonight was quick, which I feel that I can say now that all the cases have been heard this evening.

493
00:44:04,844 --> 00:44:06,365
[SPEAKER_07]: But it can be hard to predict.

494
00:44:06,405 --> 00:44:10,907
[SPEAKER_07]: We've had short meetings run crazy long and vice versa.

495
00:44:11,367 --> 00:44:18,650
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as 290 Salem wanted to continue, and so I was like, oh, this is going to be short, because the other two were already mostly approved.

496
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:19,210
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

497
00:44:24,133 --> 00:44:33,680
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mean, if anybody has a feeling that they don't want to use one of the board meetings, that that's not a good place to have a comment, just could tell us that too.

498
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:35,082
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, we can figure this out.

499
00:44:36,483 --> 00:44:45,309
[SPEAKER_07]: We are making up the, other than the legally required elements, we are making up this process as we go along, and we are open to suggestion.

500
00:44:45,329 --> 00:44:51,935
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and I'm excited that you have Emily Enns and her team on it.

501
00:44:56,291 --> 00:45:02,337
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, so there are some interesting analysis that's going to be that we can look at and stuff as well.

502
00:45:03,258 --> 00:45:14,408
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a resident, I don't know if any of you have seen this, but there's a resident who had done some analysis of our existing parcels in terms of what were the size of the parcels.

503
00:45:14,889 --> 00:45:20,915
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you looked at them and you colored them to which were the ones that are currently conforming with the

504
00:45:21,355 --> 00:45:24,078
[SPEAKER_07]: with regards to lot size, how many is that?

505
00:45:24,458 --> 00:45:31,224
[SPEAKER_07]: And then as you decrease the lot size, what percentage of our parcels are now, would it be legally conforming?

506
00:45:31,725 --> 00:45:38,511
[SPEAKER_07]: And he presented that, but he's also done other analyses of different dimensional things.

507
00:45:38,931 --> 00:45:42,595
[SPEAKER_07]: And I thought that was really interesting because it actually shows that

508
00:45:44,011 --> 00:45:50,434
[SPEAKER_07]: Very few Medford residential parcels actually conform with lot size to our zoning.

509
00:45:52,255 --> 00:46:05,200
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we've asked him to meet with Emily's data analysis team to kind of talk through some of these ideas and different visualizations and ways of looking at the data to help people understand it.

510
00:46:08,745 --> 00:46:29,578
[SPEAKER_07]: And I will say on the list is absolutely climate resiliency items so that we actually have a climate planner who part of her role, part of the grant that hired her is to help adopt more climate resiliency policies into our ordinances and regulations.

511
00:46:30,518 --> 00:46:33,240
[SPEAKER_07]: So she's produced a list already for the city to consider.

512
00:46:41,178 --> 00:46:45,663
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still on a 10-feet setbacks, which usually you find in a park.

513
00:46:45,924 --> 00:46:46,284
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

514
00:46:47,626 --> 00:46:48,266
[SPEAKER_05]: So weird.

515
00:46:48,286 --> 00:46:53,473
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

516
00:46:53,853 --> 00:46:59,199
[SPEAKER_07]: I certainly, if there are things in our zoning that any of you just straight up think this is weird,

517
00:47:00,267 --> 00:47:07,232
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't assume that we already know and it's already on our list, unless it's like my favorite example that I keep using in front of you.

518
00:47:07,252 --> 00:47:15,838
[SPEAKER_07]: I would rather just have you... I would rather have each of you individually send it to me than later somebody go, why did you include this one?

519
00:47:15,878 --> 00:47:16,619
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so obvious.

520
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:18,981
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like, oh, I missed that one.

521
00:47:22,883 --> 00:47:24,885
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not obvious since we have to use it.

522
00:47:25,966 --> 00:47:28,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes we'll stare at something for so long that we don't even...

523
00:47:30,067 --> 00:47:32,528
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we'll miss things because we assume it's there.

524
00:47:34,049 --> 00:47:37,011
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sometimes just like a fresh set of eyes really helps.

525
00:47:38,171 --> 00:47:38,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.

526
00:47:38,752 --> 00:47:39,612
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had that happen.

527
00:47:43,154 --> 00:47:43,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

528
00:47:44,735 --> 00:47:47,516
[SPEAKER_05]: If there are no other items, I do have one.

529
00:47:47,676 --> 00:47:52,499
[SPEAKER_05]: So our next meeting is April 17th and I will be away that week.

530
00:47:55,368 --> 00:47:57,269
[SPEAKER_05]: So I wanted to put that on the table right now.

531
00:47:57,349 --> 00:48:04,592
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the week that follows my first marriage anniversary.

532
00:48:05,192 --> 00:48:06,213
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I will not be here.

533
00:48:06,413 --> 00:48:10,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, Emily.

534
00:48:10,515 --> 00:48:11,035
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll be here.

535
00:48:11,535 --> 00:48:12,676
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll be here, awesome.

536
00:48:13,456 --> 00:48:17,058
[SPEAKER_05]: And so Emily said she'll be here.

537
00:48:17,118 --> 00:48:22,440
[SPEAKER_05]: And so hopefully she will graciously step into that role to run the meeting.

538
00:48:23,718 --> 00:48:32,660
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I was just going to make sure that Pam has listened to the 290 Salem Street case.

539
00:48:35,281 --> 00:48:35,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

540
00:48:35,521 --> 00:48:40,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Because she's the one who's eligible to vote on that, because you can only miss one meeting and then listen to it.

541
00:48:41,643 --> 00:48:44,704
[SPEAKER_03]: And Sally and Sherrod had missed two, so they're not eligible.

542
00:48:45,244 --> 00:48:52,746
[SPEAKER_03]: So as long as we have Emily, Peter, Ari, and Pam caught up, then we'll be ready to vote on.

543
00:48:54,721 --> 00:48:58,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Peter and Ari, do you have any conflicts on the 17th?

544
00:48:58,923 --> 00:49:01,044
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you think that you- I should be there.

545
00:49:04,226 --> 00:49:06,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Checking my calendar now, but I don't believe so.

546
00:49:06,527 --> 00:49:12,210
[SPEAKER_06]: No, we're good to go.

547
00:49:12,230 --> 00:49:15,572
[SPEAKER_06]: School vacation week, but I don't know if that impacts us.

548
00:49:18,470 --> 00:49:19,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it school vacation?

549
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:25,773
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it always starts with Patriot's Day and I thought Patriot's Day was the following week.

550
00:49:26,153 --> 00:49:30,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, then now it's very early this year.

551
00:49:30,475 --> 00:49:34,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's school vacation week, but I will be back.

552
00:49:35,037 --> 00:49:36,917
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll be at this meeting.

553
00:49:36,937 --> 00:49:42,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably third exhausted from Disney World.

554
00:49:46,682 --> 00:49:49,204
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the 15th this week, this year, huh?

555
00:49:52,787 --> 00:49:53,128
Okay.

556
00:49:54,909 --> 00:49:58,712
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it might just be 290 Salem that'll be on this.

557
00:49:59,113 --> 00:50:00,054
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's the only item.

558
00:50:01,114 --> 00:50:03,497
[SPEAKER_03]: So as soon as I get those revisions,

559
00:50:05,068 --> 00:50:08,509
[SPEAKER_03]: I will send them off to you so you can digest them, have any feedback.

560
00:50:10,009 --> 00:50:11,309
[SPEAKER_06]: Confirm file access.

561
00:50:12,390 --> 00:50:14,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

562
00:50:16,671 --> 00:50:16,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

563
00:50:19,311 --> 00:50:23,732
[SPEAKER_03]: Really, really appreciate the patience of you guys with our file issues.

564
00:50:25,373 --> 00:50:27,513
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all human, I think.

565
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:32,364
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully they won't come back with something, because they had revised plans.
