[SPEAKER_13]: Present.

Present.

[SPEAKER_13]: Present.

11
00:00:18,367 --> 00:00:19,028
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Marksley?

12
00:00:19,548 --> 00:00:19,788
[SPEAKER_08]: Present.

00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:21,610
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Scarpelli?

14
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:21,790
[SPEAKER_13]: Present.

00:00:23,352 --> 00:00:24,212
[SPEAKER_13]: President Dello Russo.

16
00:00:24,312 --> 00:00:24,733
[SPEAKER_13]: Present.

17
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:30,515
[SPEAKER_03]: With the five members present, two absent, please join me in rising to salute the flag.

18
00:00:31,295 --> 00:00:42,259
[SPEAKER_02]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

19
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Chair recognizes Councilor Knight for suspension of the rules.

20
00:00:47,702 --> 00:00:49,462
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll arrest that we have a full body, Mr. President.

21
00:00:49,722 --> 00:00:50,142
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry?

22
00:00:50,322 --> 00:00:51,463
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll waive the suspension.

23
00:00:51,503 --> 00:00:53,883
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll waive my motion to suspend the rules until we have a full body.

24
00:00:54,143 --> 00:00:54,603
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good.

25
00:00:56,143 --> 00:01:11,686
[SPEAKER_03]: Number 16-334 offered by Councilor Marks, be resolved that the city undertake a complete citywide assessment of the current condition of all streets and repair the potholes where necessary.

26
00:01:11,766 --> 00:01:12,886
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

27
00:01:13,966 --> 00:01:15,007
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

28
00:01:15,187 --> 00:01:16,767
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know many other members of

29
00:01:17,485 --> 00:01:21,328
[SPEAKER_08]: This council have offered this same resolution over the past several months.

30
00:01:23,449 --> 00:01:27,972
[SPEAKER_08]: Our streets are getting worse and worse as the days go by.

31
00:01:29,093 --> 00:01:31,414
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really no longer pothole patrol now.

32
00:01:31,914 --> 00:01:35,917
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's a complete street repair for many of our roads.

33
00:01:36,297 --> 00:01:42,982
[SPEAKER_08]: And I asked back some several months ago that there be done a complete audit of our streets.

34
00:01:43,762 --> 00:01:46,544
[SPEAKER_08]: And I have yet to see any response from the city administration.

35
00:01:47,377 --> 00:01:53,579
[SPEAKER_08]: However, I do see potholes being filled here and there, but clearly it's not enough.

36
00:01:53,639 --> 00:02:01,061
[SPEAKER_08]: All you need to do is go down any of the major roads in the city and you'll see it littered with potholes.

37
00:02:01,901 --> 00:02:04,261
[SPEAKER_08]: And secondary roads are equally as bad.

38
00:02:04,982 --> 00:02:14,564
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think with money coming in from what we heard recently that the city is combining with the state, with this complete streets grant program,

39
00:02:15,297 --> 00:02:27,763
[SPEAKER_08]: that we should be receiving some funding shortly that that be earmarked for street replacement, as well as pothole improvement throughout the commonwealth.

40
00:02:28,464 --> 00:02:32,066
[SPEAKER_08]: And actually throughout the city, but actually throughout the commonwealth, too.

41
00:02:32,506 --> 00:02:36,148
[SPEAKER_08]: But in particular, this city is in very bad shape.

42
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:44,112
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would ask that we receive, Mr. President, a complete rundown and assessment of the current conditions

43
00:02:44,787 --> 00:03:03,977
[SPEAKER_08]: of all our city streets and also recommendations by the administration on what we're going to do, Mr. President, because I realize that our streets are old, and after the frost of the winter and after the plows go up and down our streets, it creates gullies and potholes and so forth.

44
00:03:03,997 --> 00:03:11,821
[SPEAKER_08]: But there has to be a better way of approaching our streets, seven square miles of road in this city of Medford.

45
00:03:13,745 --> 00:03:15,045
[SPEAKER_08]: We have to be more proactive.

46
00:03:15,505 --> 00:03:25,248
[SPEAKER_08]: And maybe we should have a hotline like the city of the Boston has, um, with, uh, calling in, um, uh, complaints to a hotline that's dedicated for potholes.

47
00:03:25,268 --> 00:03:38,812
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, and I know the city's moving forward with the C click fix program, which, uh, this council has been pushing for, for a number of years, but maybe a program dedicated to, uh, just potholes in the community.

48
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:40,512
[SPEAKER_08]: And that way we could have,

49
00:03:41,167 --> 00:03:49,670
[SPEAKER_08]: thousands of residents be our eyes and ears in the community and alert city officials, in particular the DPW, that there are potholes.

50
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:56,772
[SPEAKER_08]: And some of these potholes, Mr. President, I took a number of pictures on my phone, and I'll pass them around if people want to see them.

51
00:03:57,152 --> 00:03:59,513
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of them are six, eight, 12 inches deep.

52
00:04:00,933 --> 00:04:10,296
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's not just a small hole now, but you can have front-end damage, tire damage, accidents, and, you know, trip and fall.

53
00:04:10,712 --> 00:04:15,975
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of circumstances that these potholes create throughout the community.

54
00:04:16,335 --> 00:04:18,396
[SPEAKER_08]: A couple of weeks ago I mentioned about catch basins.

55
00:04:18,917 --> 00:04:31,204
[SPEAKER_08]: I would ask any one of my council colleagues to take a ride around the city and I guarantee you on every street you go down you're going to see a catch basin, not a sewer, a catch basin that along the curbs

56
00:04:31,651 --> 00:04:34,052
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to see them collapsing inwards.

57
00:04:35,032 --> 00:04:37,954
[SPEAKER_08]: And you're going to find these on almost every street throughout the community.

58
00:04:38,514 --> 00:04:39,314
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's prolific.

59
00:04:39,454 --> 00:04:41,015
[SPEAKER_08]: And we have a big problem.

60
00:04:41,575 --> 00:04:43,836
[SPEAKER_08]: A pothole, you can throw a little tire in and then move on.

61
00:04:44,296 --> 00:04:48,598
[SPEAKER_08]: When you have a collapsed catch basin, that's a very big concern in this community.

62
00:04:48,978 --> 00:04:54,280
[SPEAKER_08]: And don't forget, the catch basins are used to cut off rain runoff water into the Mystic River.

63
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,142
[SPEAKER_08]: So they serve a purpose for flooding and other issues in this community.

64
00:04:58,602 --> 00:05:00,823
[SPEAKER_08]: And if we neglect these for years and years,

65
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:11,782
[SPEAKER_08]: in years and not use the $8 million we have in surplus to address water and sewer surplus to address some of these issues, we're going to have some grave concerns in this community.

66
00:05:12,182 --> 00:05:17,825
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't know what it's going to take, Mr. President, but I think what we're seeing right now is that it's becoming overwhelming.

67
00:05:18,306 --> 00:05:29,733
[SPEAKER_08]: And we had the DPW Commissioner, Brian Kerins, the acting DPW Commissioner, at a meeting several weeks back, and I posed the question to him, and he agreed that this is a major concern.

68
00:05:30,307 --> 00:05:36,451
[SPEAKER_08]: And many of these, uh, catch basins, uh, have been neglected over the years and now we're going to pay the price.

69
00:05:37,191 --> 00:05:43,875
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh, you know, I'm hoping maybe with, uh, some of this complete street program grant money, we can address the potholes.

70
00:05:44,295 --> 00:05:48,637
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm hoping we can address crosswalks, which I have another resolution on next.

71
00:05:49,218 --> 00:05:54,841
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm hoping we can address some of the catch basin issues that we have, uh, Mr. President, as well as,

72
00:05:55,334 --> 00:06:03,760
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, no one wants to talk about the water and sewer infrastructure, as well as our sewer infrastructure, which is costing ratepayers about 50%.

73
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:10,785
[SPEAKER_08]: If you look at your sewer bill, about 50% of it is through I&I, inflow and infiltration.

74
00:06:11,206 --> 00:06:17,730
[SPEAKER_08]: The water seeping into our older sewer pipes, it's being carted out to Deer Island, and it's being treated as raw sewage.

75
00:06:18,171 --> 00:06:24,195
[SPEAKER_08]: All it is is rain, runoff water, and it's costing about 50% to the ratepayers of this community.

76
00:06:24,574 --> 00:06:25,795
[SPEAKER_08]: on their, on their sewer bill.

77
00:06:26,516 --> 00:06:46,915
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, unless we can start tackling these issues, realigning some of our hotspots we have in the community, which we have countless reports in, uh, in the, uh, um, the engineering office, uh, from studies that were done in the past to alert us where these hotspots are, uh, that are accepting groundwater.

78
00:06:47,613 --> 00:06:50,056
[SPEAKER_08]: and the city has done very little to nothing.

79
00:06:50,417 --> 00:07:03,113
[SPEAKER_08]: They've done some stuff, but very little to nothing on obtaining 0% finance loans from the MWRA and also using our own surplus, which the intent of our surplus is there for,

80
00:07:04,393 --> 00:07:15,316
[SPEAKER_08]: particular projects, and these projects would all be infrastructure improvements and would also eventually reduce some of the rates that we're paying in this community.

81
00:07:15,696 --> 00:07:19,297
[SPEAKER_08]: People always ask me, well, how are we going to get a hold of our water and sewer rates?

82
00:07:19,937 --> 00:07:25,619
[SPEAKER_08]: One of them is to have a systematic long-term approach to addressing these issues.

83
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:28,840
[SPEAKER_08]: And we have yet to create anything in this community

84
00:07:29,247 --> 00:07:33,450
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, because it's underground, you can see what we do with our buildings that are above ground.

85
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:34,311
[SPEAKER_08]: We neglect them.

86
00:07:34,671 --> 00:07:38,354
[SPEAKER_08]: You can imagine these sewer pipes that are 90, 100 years old underground.

87
00:07:38,934 --> 00:07:40,916
[SPEAKER_08]: The city is paying no attention to them.

88
00:07:41,476 --> 00:07:42,597
[SPEAKER_08]: And guess what?

89
00:07:42,897 --> 00:07:47,220
[SPEAKER_08]: The ratepayers in this community are paying for that lack of attention over the years.

90
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:52,764
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would just ask, Mr. President, that we get back a citywide assessment of all our streets.

91
00:07:53,225 --> 00:07:58,989
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, if and when the street state complete streets grant program.

92
00:07:59,385 --> 00:08:21,435
[SPEAKER_08]: that's a mouthful comes in that we also look at addressing some of the concerns we have with our infrastructure, uh, throughout the community and also look at the, uh, $8 million in surplus of ratepayers money and the water and sewer enterprise account to start addressing these issues that at least I've been speaking about for at least 14 years now of addressing.

93
00:08:22,115 --> 00:08:25,797
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh, the city will go ahead here and there on small projects,

94
00:08:26,267 --> 00:08:35,850
[SPEAKER_08]: but never really want to put a full, long-term, systematic approach to tackling some of these issues on behalf of the ratepayers.

95
00:08:36,991 --> 00:08:38,231
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

96
00:08:39,712 --> 00:08:47,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Clerk, if you would be so kind as to mark Councilors Scarpelli and Falco, respectively, as present.

97
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:49,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight.

98
00:08:49,915 --> 00:08:50,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Move approval, Mr. President.

99
00:08:51,216 --> 00:08:54,457
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion of approval, Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Marks,

100
00:08:54,903 --> 00:08:55,784
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

101
00:08:55,804 --> 00:08:55,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

102
00:08:56,724 --> 00:08:57,625
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

103
00:08:58,325 --> 00:08:58,405
Aye.

104
00:08:58,565 --> 00:08:59,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to suspend the rules, Mr. President.

105
00:08:59,886 --> 00:09:04,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to suspend the rules offered by Councilor Knight.

106
00:09:04,529 --> 00:09:05,490
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

107
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,591
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

108
00:09:07,191 --> 00:09:09,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight, your reason for suspending the rules, sir.

109
00:09:09,713 --> 00:09:18,438
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to take paper 16295 relative to the personnel ordinance related to our fire department and their compensation package that is now completed at its first and second reading, Mr. President.

110
00:09:18,819 --> 00:09:19,499
[SPEAKER_03]: With delight.

111
00:09:19,939 --> 00:09:20,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Before us is 16295.

112
00:09:22,788 --> 00:09:27,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Amendment of Chapter 66, Personnel Fire Department, eligible for third reading.

113
00:09:28,631 --> 00:09:42,358
[SPEAKER_03]: This was the conversation package that was negotiated and presented to us first on March 8th, had its second advertised reading on March 17th, and is now before us for conversation.

114
00:09:42,778 --> 00:09:43,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Chair awaits a motion.

115
00:09:44,239 --> 00:09:45,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I'd move for approval.

116
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:52,263
[SPEAKER_05]: The reason the matter was tabled was not that anybody behind this rail had a problem with it, I don't think, but it was to give the public an opportunity to digest the package.

117
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:55,571
[SPEAKER_05]: and to have an opportunity to speak if, in fact, they were opposed to it.

118
00:09:55,611 --> 00:10:02,512
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't seem like anybody here in the audience is here today to oppose the hardworking men and women of our fire department from receiving a cost of living adjustment.

119
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:05,232
[SPEAKER_05]: So as such, Mr. President, I would move for approval.

120
00:10:06,332 --> 00:10:12,653
[SPEAKER_03]: So with nobody here in opposition, and with the motion of approval, Councilor Knight, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

121
00:10:15,094 --> 00:10:15,894
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Caraviello?

122
00:10:15,914 --> 00:10:16,014
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

123
00:10:16,874 --> 00:10:17,494
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Falco?

124
00:10:17,514 --> 00:10:17,634
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

125
00:10:18,454 --> 00:10:18,975
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight?

126
00:10:19,455 --> 00:10:19,655
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

127
00:10:20,195 --> 00:10:21,115
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice President Long and Kern?

128
00:10:21,135 --> 00:10:21,215
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

129
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:22,530
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Marks?

130
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:22,790
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

131
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:24,150
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Scampelli?

132
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:24,390
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

133
00:10:25,011 --> 00:10:25,671
[SPEAKER_13]: President Dello Russo?

134
00:10:25,771 --> 00:10:26,231
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

135
00:10:26,371 --> 00:10:29,912
[SPEAKER_03]: With a vote of seven in the affirmative, none in the negative, congratulations.

136
00:10:30,452 --> 00:10:33,212
[SPEAKER_03]: The ordinance is, or the matter is ordained.

137
00:10:36,293 --> 00:10:41,834
[SPEAKER_03]: On motion of Councilor Knight to assume the regular order of business, all those in favor?

138
00:10:42,234 --> 00:10:44,475
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

139
00:10:44,495 --> 00:10:50,996
[SPEAKER_03]: 16-335 offered by Councilor Marks, whereas the Mayor's transition team on constituent services

140
00:10:51,570 --> 00:11:15,147
[SPEAKER_03]: just released priority recommendations gathered from a survey and four community meetings and whereas one of the recommendations to mayor was to assess and improve pedestrian safety across the city and whereas many of the city's crosswalks throughout the community are faded and not clearly visible posing

141
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:37,991
[SPEAKER_03]: a pedestrian public safety concern and whereas through a traditional yearly method of painting the crosswalks is not working, leaving our residents at risk when crossing the streets, then be it resolved that the mayor implement a policy for the use of thermoplastic replacing traditional paint on all crosswalks.

142
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:49,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Thermoplastic is a highly reflective material, which lasts up to five years compared to the traditional paint, which is hard to see and fades typically within one year.

143
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:56,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Thermoplastic is a more cost effective in the long run and provides residents with safer crossing.

144
00:11:56,835 --> 00:11:59,836
[SPEAKER_03]: Chair recognizes the presenter, Councilor Marks.

145
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,198
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

146
00:12:02,598 --> 00:12:06,600
[SPEAKER_08]: I've offered this resolution at least four or five times.

147
00:12:07,302 --> 00:12:11,305
[SPEAKER_08]: over the past number of years, uh, relative to pedestrian safety in this community.

148
00:12:11,325 --> 00:12:21,011
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, for those that have been around for a while, know that, uh, that has always been, uh, one of my major concerns, uh, throughout the community is pedestrian safety.

149
00:12:21,652 --> 00:12:31,278
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, it was back in 2006 that I offered the resolution asking for the city to look into the use of thermoplastic, uh, because,

150
00:12:31,994 --> 00:12:35,037
[SPEAKER_08]: It seems year after year, it was like Groundhog Day.

151
00:12:35,878 --> 00:12:40,062
[SPEAKER_08]: Every year, this time of year, we're faced with faded crosswalks.

152
00:12:40,482 --> 00:12:47,329
[SPEAKER_08]: If you go around the community, I'd say probably roughly 70 to 80% of our crosswalks are faded or barely visible.

153
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:54,596
[SPEAKER_08]: And these are supposed to be the areas where pedestrians know to cross because it's safe to cross in these particular areas.

154
00:12:55,373 --> 00:13:01,377
[SPEAKER_08]: And year after year, bringing the subject up every year, saying, well, we painted them six months ago.

155
00:13:01,437 --> 00:13:02,117
[SPEAKER_08]: Now they're faded.

156
00:13:02,418 --> 00:13:06,800
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the winter gets to them, and the plows scratch them up, and they fade away.

157
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:22,250
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought thermoplastic, which is used by a number of surrounding communities, Arlington, Cambridge, Boston, the state uses thermoplastic when they do their markings, was an effective and efficient way

158
00:13:22,733 --> 00:13:26,783
[SPEAKER_08]: of not only having our personnel go out every year and take the time to paint.

159
00:13:27,202 --> 00:13:36,229
[SPEAKER_08]: the hundreds of crosswalks throughout the community, but also have a peace of mind knowing that once thermal plastic is laid down, that it lost up to five years.

160
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:41,292
[SPEAKER_08]: So it won't be Groundhog Day every year saying, you know what, we gotta get out there and paint them again.

161
00:13:41,332 --> 00:13:42,213
[SPEAKER_08]: Why aren't they painted?

162
00:13:42,473 --> 00:13:43,554
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's not doing their job?

163
00:13:43,594 --> 00:13:44,835
[SPEAKER_08]: Why are things aren't getting done?

164
00:13:45,155 --> 00:13:46,656
[SPEAKER_08]: Why is it unsafe to cross?

165
00:13:47,317 --> 00:13:48,838
[SPEAKER_08]: And it didn't make any sense.

166
00:13:49,218 --> 00:13:55,783
[SPEAKER_08]: So back in 2006, after my resolution, the mayor at the time, Mayor McGlynn,

167
00:13:56,658 --> 00:14:01,942
[SPEAKER_08]: put forth 66 crosswalks throughout the community that were done with thermoplastic.

168
00:14:02,543 --> 00:14:14,532
[SPEAKER_08]: And I remember at the time it was actually a proud moment that when these were done and for many years these crosswalks did stay in great shape and they were highly visible.

169
00:14:14,902 --> 00:14:29,172
[SPEAKER_08]: because thermoplastic is very reflective and it alerts cars that someone's in the crosswalk, which ultimately is what is the intent of these crosswalks, to let people know.

170
00:14:29,453 --> 00:14:30,473
[SPEAKER_08]: The signage is great.

171
00:14:30,533 --> 00:14:35,257
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll see the city now putting up neon signs, yellow and green, around the crosswalks.

172
00:14:35,607 --> 00:14:37,929
[SPEAKER_08]: but the crosswalks themselves are faded.

173
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:43,252
[SPEAKER_08]: And this particular thermoplastic over the years has improved.

174
00:14:43,612 --> 00:14:44,593
[SPEAKER_08]: It's slip resistant.

175
00:14:44,933 --> 00:14:45,954
[SPEAKER_08]: It's highly reflective.

176
00:14:46,254 --> 00:14:48,896
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I said, it's life expectancy is up to five years.

177
00:14:49,696 --> 00:14:59,183
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a little more expensive to lay down, but in the long run, it's cost effective because you're not having to go out there every year and take a certain number of city employees to paint them.

178
00:14:59,603 --> 00:15:01,024
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's if they all get done.

179
00:15:02,585 --> 00:15:05,207
[SPEAKER_08]: And I asked through this resolution that

180
00:15:06,387 --> 00:15:26,258
[SPEAKER_08]: the city create a policy, and I believe there's a policy in Cambridge that you can go on their website, but any new road construction, any re-digging on Cambridge streets, they require it to be replaced, even if it was originally painted in an area, they require it to be replaced with thermoplastic.

181
00:15:26,898 --> 00:15:34,462
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm asking that the city administration create a policy in our community that any new roads, thermoplastic is placed down,

182
00:15:35,046 --> 00:15:43,429
[SPEAKER_08]: and that from here on in, the painting of crosswalks throughout the community be done with thermoplastic and not regular paint.

183
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:53,373
[SPEAKER_08]: And I ask that we as a community do a better job when it comes to pedestrian safety.

184
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,274
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's one thing to talk about pedestrian safety.

185
00:15:56,674 --> 00:15:59,255
[SPEAKER_08]: It's one thing to say that we're a safe community.

186
00:15:59,856 --> 00:16:03,177
[SPEAKER_08]: But in my opinion, you have to put your money where your mouth is.

187
00:16:04,025 --> 00:16:08,748
[SPEAKER_08]: And in my opinion, thermoplastic is the way to go.

188
00:16:09,289 --> 00:16:13,491
[SPEAKER_08]: Thermoplastic will provide safe crossing areas in our community.

189
00:16:13,911 --> 00:16:16,453
[SPEAKER_08]: It defines where you're supposed to cross.

190
00:16:16,873 --> 00:16:20,075
[SPEAKER_08]: Right now, you don't know if you're in a crosswalk or not because it's faded.

191
00:16:21,076 --> 00:16:30,942
[SPEAKER_08]: This clearly defines and delineates where people are supposed to cross, and it makes it a safer crossing area, and especially at nighttime in this community.

192
00:16:31,443 --> 00:16:31,963
[SPEAKER_08]: So to me,

193
00:16:33,248 --> 00:16:34,508
[SPEAKER_08]: This should be done.

194
00:16:35,109 --> 00:16:36,730
[SPEAKER_08]: It should be part of the city policy.

195
00:16:37,511 --> 00:16:39,932
[SPEAKER_08]: I look forward to a response from this administration.

196
00:16:40,393 --> 00:16:58,465
[SPEAKER_08]: There is money, again, through the state Complete Streets grant program that specifically earmarks money to pedestrian safety, and this would be an ideal situation so we don't have to talk about it year after year after year after year, every year since I've been on the council.

197
00:16:59,126 --> 00:17:02,188
[SPEAKER_08]: It's 14 years now since I've been on the council.

198
00:17:02,695 --> 00:17:09,041
[SPEAKER_08]: Every year, at a certain point, April, May, we start complaining that our crosswalks aren't painted.

199
00:17:09,381 --> 00:17:14,205
[SPEAKER_08]: Then we hear back from the city saying they're gonna get to it, they're not sure if they can get to all of them, and so forth.

200
00:17:14,606 --> 00:17:28,218
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's alleviate that situation, and that's ensure our residents have a safe place to cross in our community, and I ask that we send this to the administration for response.

201
00:17:33,068 --> 00:17:34,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilman Marks.

202
00:17:34,308 --> 00:17:35,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

203
00:17:36,469 --> 00:17:37,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, move for approval.

204
00:17:39,329 --> 00:17:45,170
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion for approval by Councilor Knight, Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

205
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:47,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

206
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:50,771
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to concur with my colleague and thank him for putting this forward.

207
00:17:51,171 --> 00:17:56,872
[SPEAKER_06]: I think a new policy is a great idea, and I think that's something that's almost a no-brainer.

208
00:17:57,972 --> 00:18:00,833
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be cost that's going to go gradual over time.

209
00:18:00,893 --> 00:18:02,853
[SPEAKER_06]: It's also going to be a cost that may go towards

210
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:06,933
[SPEAKER_06]: certain developers or certain companies that are doing work on our roads.

211
00:18:07,273 --> 00:18:13,377
[SPEAKER_06]: So I fully support that new policy, and I hope that the mayor does really look into that.

212
00:18:13,857 --> 00:18:21,022
[SPEAKER_06]: And you said maybe we can get her a copy of, you know, the policy that Cambridge or Boston follows so that we can make that a reality.

213
00:18:21,042 --> 00:18:22,643
[SPEAKER_06]: I also agree.

214
00:18:22,663 --> 00:18:29,308
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, being on the council for so long, one huge complaint that we hear over and over again is the crosswalks fading.

215
00:18:29,668 --> 00:18:32,190
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, through our winters, whether we have a

216
00:18:32,684 --> 00:18:35,785
[SPEAKER_06]: a decent one like we had this year, or a winter like last year.

217
00:18:35,845 --> 00:18:41,466
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the crosswalks are completely faded, and it boils down to one thing, and that one thing is public safety.

218
00:18:41,566 --> 00:18:52,430
[SPEAKER_06]: We have disabled seniors, children walking our streets, crossing our streets to get to school every day, and that's one thing we can do to make it safer.

219
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:59,391
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it's important, and I think it's something that, you know, our DPW is understaffed, so it is hard to cover the entire city.

220
00:18:59,812 --> 00:19:01,012
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we have a system where

221
00:19:01,702 --> 00:19:08,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if we did 20% each year thermoplastic, we're going to only have to replace 20% per year.

222
00:19:08,465 --> 00:19:10,946
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's something that needs to be looked into.

223
00:19:11,026 --> 00:19:12,546
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to get cost estimates.

224
00:19:12,946 --> 00:19:17,888
[SPEAKER_06]: And I hope that, again, the mayor really looks into this and we can make it a reality.

225
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:20,769
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's going to create a much safer community.

226
00:19:20,829 --> 00:19:29,693
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's, I think, what a number of residents and people who live in our community are looking for, especially those who are active in the complete streets approach.

227
00:19:30,194 --> 00:19:32,795
[SPEAKER_06]: and there's a number of those people, and I think it's important.

228
00:19:32,915 --> 00:19:35,336
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's very important, and I thank you for bringing it forward.

229
00:19:36,056 --> 00:19:38,877
[SPEAKER_06]: I second the motion to move approval.

230
00:19:39,477 --> 00:19:39,857
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

231
00:19:39,977 --> 00:19:58,303
[SPEAKER_03]: So on the motion for approval by Councilor Knight, as seconded by Vice President Lungo-Koehn, we have a citizen who wishes to speak, but before we do so, while it comes to mind, I might add parenthetically that the format of these two motions that are before us that we've had thus far

232
00:19:58,787 --> 00:20:00,068
[SPEAKER_03]: tonight are in proper form.

233
00:20:00,128 --> 00:20:04,111
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to thank, and there's some others that are on here tonight that are in proper form.

234
00:20:04,552 --> 00:20:18,302
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to thank my colleagues for presenting their matters to the council in proper form rather than leaving them a vaguely place, which would be contrary to a good procedure.

235
00:20:18,783 --> 00:20:24,708
[SPEAKER_03]: So at this time we invite our good citizen to present herself and state her name and address for the record.

236
00:20:25,068 --> 00:20:25,288
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

237
00:20:25,938 --> 00:20:28,340
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Rachel Tannenhaus, 26 Pearl Street.

238
00:20:30,102 --> 00:20:32,944
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously, people seem to be pretty much in agreement with this.

239
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:36,708
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a question for the president.

240
00:20:38,329 --> 00:20:47,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a reason, it's my understanding, as Councilman Marks said, that this has been brought up approximately eight zillion times, so I was wondering if there was a reason why it hasn't gone through in the past?

241
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:54,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, we can only, uh, suggest things that it's an administrative decision.

242
00:20:54,120 --> 00:21:00,663
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was above the level of the, so what you're saying is that the, where, where it got bogged down was above the level of the city council.

243
00:21:00,923 --> 00:21:01,123
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

244
00:21:01,163 --> 00:21:15,610
[SPEAKER_03]: The city have, unless we create an ordinance that we go to thermoplastic nuclear, uh, crosswalks that, um, uh, but, uh, that might be a stretch and, um, but it's an administrative matter that's done

245
00:21:16,722 --> 00:21:39,602
[SPEAKER_03]: in consultation with the director of the department of public works and historically the director of public works, which I think there were some people that are of the opinion, uh, including the previous, uh, DPW director that, um, the thermoplastic crosswalks, uh, while they last long, um, are also prone to other problems.

246
00:21:40,222 --> 00:21:43,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, it doesn't mean that any of the Councilors are in agreement with that,

247
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:48,771
[SPEAKER_03]: But there is, in people who manage cities, an opinion of that kind.

248
00:21:49,251 --> 00:21:49,852
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

249
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:51,512
[SPEAKER_07]: No accusation intended.

250
00:21:51,572 --> 00:21:53,452
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wasn't here, so I didn't know.

251
00:21:57,613 --> 00:22:11,017
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to make the, not the argument, but the statement that not only is it good for public safety, it's also good for broader public health, not just in terms of injury prevention, but in terms of

252
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:22,524
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the things that happens with Complete Streets programs is that people are able to get more physical activity, and the health of the residents of the city tends to improve.

253
00:22:22,584 --> 00:22:25,325
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you are not safe crossing the street, you're not going to walk around there.

254
00:22:26,705 --> 00:22:30,546
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's also a public health investment, and it's a business investment.

255
00:22:30,586 --> 00:22:36,729
[SPEAKER_07]: Because again, in areas where people do not feel safe crossing the street, they're not going to frequent those businesses.

256
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:40,650
[SPEAKER_07]: So in fact, I don't have numbers in front of me that state

257
00:22:40,935 --> 00:22:43,797
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, this dollar amount, this dollar amount, therefore it pays for itself.

258
00:22:44,198 --> 00:22:45,599
[SPEAKER_07]: But I bet those data are out there.

259
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:58,490
[SPEAKER_07]: If DPW, you know, had something to say about it or wanted to talk to the health department or something like that, you know, the city health department about it, it also is a huge access issue.

260
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:01,713
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that obviously I can only, you know,

261
00:23:02,696 --> 00:23:06,437
[SPEAKER_07]: I can only use the crossings that I know about.

262
00:23:06,978 --> 00:23:09,358
[SPEAKER_07]: And this guy can only guide me to the crossings he knows about.

263
00:23:10,299 --> 00:23:13,920
[SPEAKER_07]: And if they're invisible, he's a very talented dog, but he really can only do so much there.

264
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:25,284
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's something where, and cars cannot stop out of the intersection if they don't know where the intersection, like out of the crosswalk if they don't know where the crosswalk is.

265
00:23:25,344 --> 00:23:28,245
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, you guys, most of you guys probably drive.

266
00:23:28,265 --> 00:23:31,186
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't need me to tell you this, but it is,

267
00:23:32,245 --> 00:23:35,368
[SPEAKER_07]: a broader issue than just, hey, can we paint some lines?

268
00:23:35,448 --> 00:23:40,552
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a matter of how usable and healthy the city is and how safe people feel here.

269
00:23:41,092 --> 00:23:47,057
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that it would be a very cost-effective investment in the city.

270
00:23:47,657 --> 00:23:50,559
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if it does weird things to snow plows or anything like that.

271
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:52,441
[SPEAKER_07]: I figure DPW knows that.

272
00:23:52,601 --> 00:23:56,264
[SPEAKER_07]: But surely there are best practices that have happened other places.

273
00:23:56,344 --> 00:23:58,025
[SPEAKER_07]: And you've mentioned Boston and Cambridge.

274
00:23:58,065 --> 00:24:00,747
[SPEAKER_07]: And they don't seem to have fallen down overnight from it.

275
00:24:02,181 --> 00:24:02,461
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

276
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:03,522
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

277
00:24:04,242 --> 00:24:04,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

278
00:24:04,883 --> 00:24:06,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

279
00:24:06,644 --> 00:24:18,710
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, Mr. President, as a point of order, we have paper one six dash three, three, nine offered by Councilor for alcohol, which is a similar subject matter, uh, speaks about the complete streets grants program, pedestrian safety issues and the like.

280
00:24:18,771 --> 00:24:22,573
[SPEAKER_05]: So it might make sense to take this matter up with the other papers that we're discussing at this point in time.

281
00:24:22,673 --> 00:24:29,917
[SPEAKER_05]: However, um, I'll leave that up to the body, but, um, it seems like, you know, the three papers that we've discussed right now all have something to do with, uh,

282
00:24:31,213 --> 00:24:36,076
[SPEAKER_05]: pedestrian safety and the complete streets grant program, but we can keep it separated if you'd like.

283
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:39,618
[SPEAKER_05]: It just seems like we're having the conversation, go with the flow, you know what I mean?

284
00:24:39,638 --> 00:24:41,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Instead of stopping the conversation, start it again later on in the meeting.

285
00:24:41,859 --> 00:24:55,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, and at some point, it would perhaps be helpful to have a presentation at some point as to what exactly complete streets are so we don't wade ourselves into a pool of confusion.

286
00:24:56,427 --> 00:24:57,908
[SPEAKER_12]: The gentleman at the podium, welcome.

287
00:24:59,556 --> 00:25:01,657
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm Nick Tomazook, 29 Garfield Ave.

288
00:25:02,057 --> 00:25:02,457
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening.

289
00:25:03,658 --> 00:25:05,179
[SPEAKER_12]: I just have a suggestion to make.

290
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:09,040
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we ought to, DPW ought to look into as a hot box.

291
00:25:09,821 --> 00:25:12,222
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, as far as fixing potholes and stuff?

292
00:25:13,102 --> 00:25:14,203
[SPEAKER_12]: Look into a hot box.

293
00:25:14,403 --> 00:25:15,283
[SPEAKER_12]: Boston bought one.

294
00:25:16,404 --> 00:25:28,009
[SPEAKER_12]: And instead of going down to the yard and getting a load of blacktop and just throwing it in the back of a dump truck, by the time they start, that stuff is starting to harden.

295
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,420
[SPEAKER_12]: Because it's cooling.

296
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,283
[SPEAKER_12]: If you get a hot box, it keeps it hot the whole time it's in there.

297
00:25:35,964 --> 00:25:41,627
[SPEAKER_12]: And the thing of it is, is you can't just take a shovel full of that stuff and throw it in a pothole and just whack it and it's fixed.

298
00:25:42,628 --> 00:25:46,550
[SPEAKER_12]: You got to put some adhesive in there so it bonds to the old stuff.

299
00:25:47,831 --> 00:25:55,555
[SPEAKER_12]: Because it makes a bigger mess by just throwing the blacktop in the pothole, hitting it with a shovel, and every car that goes by picks up a couple of stones.

300
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,721
[SPEAKER_12]: And before you know it, it's back.

301
00:26:00,022 --> 00:26:03,184
[SPEAKER_12]: I had the potholes fixed on my street a couple of months ago.

302
00:26:03,984 --> 00:26:04,784
[SPEAKER_12]: The potholes are back.

303
00:26:05,925 --> 00:26:07,306
[SPEAKER_12]: Because all the blacktop came out.

304
00:26:07,326 --> 00:26:08,987
[SPEAKER_12]: The cops took it out.

305
00:26:10,288 --> 00:26:11,889
[SPEAKER_12]: So I mean, I just want to make a suggestion.

306
00:26:11,929 --> 00:26:14,270
[SPEAKER_12]: If we get a hot box, it's going to work better.

307
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:17,792
[SPEAKER_12]: Because the stuff will be hot when it comes out.

308
00:26:18,532 --> 00:26:19,653
[SPEAKER_12]: And it adheres better.

309
00:26:19,893 --> 00:26:20,734
[SPEAKER_12]: It adheres better.

310
00:26:20,774 --> 00:26:23,395
[SPEAKER_12]: But they have a sealant that you spray.

311
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:25,957
[SPEAKER_12]: And it adheres the black.

312
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:28,151
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, the old to the new.

313
00:26:28,651 --> 00:26:29,052
[SPEAKER_02]: I see.

314
00:26:29,392 --> 00:26:29,652
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

315
00:26:30,733 --> 00:26:34,056
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, like when you're going to fix a cement, you have to wet it.

316
00:26:34,436 --> 00:26:35,177
[SPEAKER_12]: So it bonds.

317
00:26:35,857 --> 00:26:36,378
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly.

318
00:26:36,978 --> 00:26:38,759
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's the same, same idea.

319
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:40,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

320
00:26:40,461 --> 00:26:41,242
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much, sir.

321
00:26:41,642 --> 00:26:46,546
[SPEAKER_03]: So on the motion approved by Councilor Knight, seconded by vice president Lundell Kern, all those in favor.

322
00:26:47,587 --> 00:26:48,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Marks.

323
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:52,911
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to say, I think, uh, one of the speakers brought up a great point and,

324
00:26:53,652 --> 00:26:55,353
[SPEAKER_08]: Why hasn't this happened over the years?

325
00:26:55,954 --> 00:26:57,174
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a great idea.

326
00:26:58,395 --> 00:26:58,935
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not new.

327
00:26:58,975 --> 00:27:00,356
[SPEAKER_08]: It's used all over the country.

328
00:27:00,897 --> 00:27:01,877
[SPEAKER_08]: The state uses it.

329
00:27:02,498 --> 00:27:04,859
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm sure they did their homework and research.

330
00:27:05,479 --> 00:27:08,041
[SPEAKER_08]: And many local big surrounding communities use it.

331
00:27:08,621 --> 00:27:14,265
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think one of the issues is that in this community, common sense doesn't always prevail.

332
00:27:15,205 --> 00:27:18,147
[SPEAKER_08]: And efficiency doesn't always prevail.

333
00:27:18,848 --> 00:27:21,049
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's what we've seen over the years.

334
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,562
[SPEAKER_08]: And you could just take a look at Ring Road.

335
00:27:24,422 --> 00:27:39,695
[SPEAKER_08]: When they did Ring Road behind the square, the city in the contract spent $56,000 on one crosswalk, one electronic sign crosswalk on Ring Road, $56,000.

336
00:27:40,396 --> 00:27:46,981
[SPEAKER_08]: And I termed it as the crosswalk to nowhere because it leads into a parking lot.

337
00:27:47,142 --> 00:27:48,623
[SPEAKER_08]: It was supposed to be set up for the seniors.

338
00:27:49,056 --> 00:28:00,102
[SPEAKER_08]: But it leads into the parking lot across the street, which doesn't have any sidewalks or anywhere for seniors to walk other than behind parked cars, which is a very dangerous situation.

339
00:28:00,623 --> 00:28:05,785
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that's what we saw over the years, the priority of putting one crosswalk for $56,000.

340
00:28:07,226 --> 00:28:09,868
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's a beautiful crosswalk.

341
00:28:10,328 --> 00:28:13,790
[SPEAKER_08]: It has airport markings that light up.

342
00:28:14,272 --> 00:28:21,374
[SPEAKER_08]: And on the street, when someone's in the crosswalk, the sign lights up, you get a handshake when you go by it.

343
00:28:21,855 --> 00:28:29,397
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a beautiful crosswalk, but for $56,000, we could have painted every crosswalk in the city with thermoplastic.

344
00:28:30,238 --> 00:28:39,381
[SPEAKER_08]: So these are the type of decisions that were made in a vacuum, in the mayor's office, with no regards to the rest of the city.

345
00:28:39,861 --> 00:28:43,122
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's why the person that spoke

346
00:28:43,535 --> 00:28:46,918
[SPEAKER_08]: at the podium said, well, why doesn't these things happen in this community?

347
00:28:47,258 --> 00:28:48,399
[SPEAKER_08]: Why does it take so long?

348
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,121
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's what we're seeing.

349
00:28:50,521 --> 00:28:55,206
[SPEAKER_08]: These are the reasons why the administration's talking about getting voicemail now.

350
00:28:55,726 --> 00:28:56,127
[SPEAKER_08]: Guess what?

351
00:28:56,467 --> 00:29:00,290
[SPEAKER_08]: City employees are going to get voicemail on their phones.

352
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:02,392
[SPEAKER_08]: That's an item from 30 years ago, Mr. President.

353
00:29:02,733 --> 00:29:03,773
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to have voicemail now.

354
00:29:04,134 --> 00:29:07,217
[SPEAKER_08]: And they may even, thanks to Councilor Longo, they may even get email.

355
00:29:08,706 --> 00:29:10,608
[SPEAKER_08]: They may even have their own email address now.

356
00:29:11,408 --> 00:29:22,817
[SPEAKER_08]: This is amazing what transformation we're going through in this city, and I think this is one of the reasons why we don't see these things enacted upon because of the lack of attention over the years.

357
00:29:23,038 --> 00:29:29,663
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope it changes, Mr. President, but thermoplastic makes sense in every stretch of the imagination.

358
00:29:30,273 --> 00:29:32,275
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no reason to research.

359
00:29:32,995 --> 00:29:40,241
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been on the pavement for years throughout this entire state and throughout this entire country, very successful.

360
00:29:40,882 --> 00:29:53,833
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, just because the city of Bedford wants to keep their head in the sand doesn't mean this isn't a cost-effective and a safe manner for people to cross on our streets and our road, Mr. President.

361
00:29:53,873 --> 00:29:57,936
[SPEAKER_08]: So I appreciate the support from my colleagues and hope for

362
00:29:58,666 --> 00:30:00,406
[SPEAKER_08]: a thorough response from the administration.

363
00:30:00,646 --> 00:30:02,747
[SPEAKER_08]: We look forward to all these innovations.

364
00:30:03,207 --> 00:30:06,688
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion for approval by Council Knight, seconded by Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

365
00:30:07,008 --> 00:30:07,788
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

366
00:30:08,188 --> 00:30:08,848
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

367
00:30:09,728 --> 00:30:11,489
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion carries unanimously.

368
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:15,850
[SPEAKER_03]: 16-336 offered by Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

369
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:26,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it resolved that the school department forward to the Medford City Council a copy of the notice policy that all principals must follow with regard to notifying parents

370
00:30:27,049 --> 00:30:36,636
[SPEAKER_03]: on emergency and non-emergency situations, such as threats to a school, lockdown drills to be performed, et cetera.

371
00:30:37,316 --> 00:30:46,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it further resolved that we be made aware of how such notification procedures will be given, phone calls, emails, et cetera.

372
00:30:47,423 --> 00:30:56,650
[SPEAKER_03]: This policy was to be drafted by mid-March, and it would be helpful for the policy to go public to reassure parents that better notification

373
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,060
[SPEAKER_03]: is now mandated.

374
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Madam Vice President.

375
00:30:59,881 --> 00:31:01,741
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

376
00:31:02,041 --> 00:31:15,905
[SPEAKER_06]: With regards to the notification, this came up in February, and the Medford City Council voted to request that we be given a copy of the policy that was motioned to be put forward, I think, by school committee woman Erin DiBenedetto.

377
00:31:15,925 --> 00:31:18,445
[SPEAKER_06]: Or, no, maybe Paulette van de Kloet.

378
00:31:18,465 --> 00:31:19,066
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't recall.

379
00:31:19,406 --> 00:31:24,507
[SPEAKER_06]: But one of them moved, and the school committee voted to create such a policy, and I as one

380
00:31:24,977 --> 00:31:33,782
[SPEAKER_06]: as a parent and as one that was getting complaints about lack of notification, wanted to stay on top of the issue, wanted to make sure that a policy was put in place.

381
00:31:34,322 --> 00:31:37,724
[SPEAKER_06]: Their deadline, I believe, was mid-March, and we hadn't received anything.

382
00:31:38,244 --> 00:31:49,570
[SPEAKER_06]: I know tonight we have a letter from the superintendent, and it does mention that parents will be notified after the situation is stabilized or evacuation protocol is implemented.

383
00:31:51,122 --> 00:32:08,493
[SPEAKER_06]: Since the March 7th meeting, they also have a new video buzzer system operational at the front door at MHS and MVTHS, and then all relevant cameras at the high school and vocational are operational, and they've upgraded certain units to provide wider coverage.

384
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:12,196
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure if this is the actual policy.

385
00:32:12,236 --> 00:32:16,299
[SPEAKER_06]: I know this identifies somewhat of a policy, but I,

386
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:19,704
[SPEAKER_06]: This isn't the full policy, if we could get a copy of it.

387
00:32:20,385 --> 00:32:31,954
[SPEAKER_06]: I also ask if we could get updated with regards to how parents will be notified with regards to emergency and non-emergency situations, because I think that's important.

388
00:32:32,034 --> 00:32:39,340
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we going to take any extra steps to create avenues to notify parents, and how will we do that?

389
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:41,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Will that be by text message?

390
00:32:41,662 --> 00:32:42,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Will that be by email?

391
00:32:43,023 --> 00:32:45,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Will that be by phone call, Facebook?

392
00:32:45,995 --> 00:32:49,218
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, any other avenue, how are parents going to get notified?

393
00:32:49,538 --> 00:32:57,605
[SPEAKER_06]: Because just like with the reverse 911 system we have with the, you know, city of Medford, people had to sign up to get notifications.

394
00:32:57,705 --> 00:32:59,246
[SPEAKER_06]: So will parents have to do that?

395
00:32:59,647 --> 00:33:08,895
[SPEAKER_06]: And if so, you know, are they going to implement such a system where a parent can go to whether it's a school committee or the principal in their school and say, I want notification.

396
00:33:08,915 --> 00:33:12,578
[SPEAKER_06]: I want more notification about what goes on within the school

397
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:21,423
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's important and it's something that I would like to see where my children go to school and what people are, you know, obviously had the initial complaints about.

398
00:33:22,284 --> 00:33:23,865
[SPEAKER_06]: We spoke about the bomb threat.

399
00:33:23,905 --> 00:33:26,907
[SPEAKER_06]: We spoke about certain parents spoke out about the Roberts.

400
00:33:27,468 --> 00:33:35,014
[SPEAKER_06]: I know specifically because my daughter goes there, there was a lockdown and parents didn't find out about it where kids, you know, hid in the classroom.

401
00:33:35,534 --> 00:33:39,217
[SPEAKER_06]: I practiced a lockdown and we didn't find out about it for a month, for a week later.

402
00:33:39,678 --> 00:33:42,140
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, how are parents going to get notified and

403
00:33:42,617 --> 00:33:47,440
[SPEAKER_06]: what is going to be put in place to make it so every parent gets notified in a reasonable manner.

404
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:51,763
[SPEAKER_06]: And if this is all that the policy, I know it's only about a sentence.

405
00:33:51,824 --> 00:33:56,147
[SPEAKER_06]: So if this is the policy, I believe it needs to be more elaborate.

406
00:33:56,207 --> 00:33:59,749
[SPEAKER_06]: And if there is a more elaborate policy, if we could get a copy of that.

407
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:00,790
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

408
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:01,410
[SPEAKER_03]: There awaits a motion.

409
00:34:02,251 --> 00:34:02,971
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion for approval.

410
00:34:03,031 --> 00:34:03,852

[SPEAKER_03]: Motion for approval with a roll call vote by Vice President Long and Kern.

412
00:34:08,255 --> 00:34:10,597

413
00:34:12,152 --> 00:34:13,013

00:34:13,033 --> 00:34:13,213
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

415
00:34:13,873 --> 00:34:14,574
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Falco?

416
00:34:14,614 --> 00:34:14,754
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

417
00:34:15,274 --> 00:34:15,815
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Mayne?

418
00:34:15,855 --> 00:34:16,035
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

419
00:34:16,775 --> 00:34:17,756
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice President Lungo-Koehn?

420
00:34:17,796 --> 00:34:18,036
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

421
00:34:18,437 --> 00:34:18,917
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Marks?

422
00:34:19,137 --> 00:34:19,397
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

423
00:34:20,018 --> 00:34:20,718
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Scarpelli?

424
00:34:20,738 --> 00:34:20,959
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

425
00:34:20,999 --> 00:34:22,340
[SPEAKER_13]: President Dello Russo?

426
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:22,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

427
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:27,043
[SPEAKER_03]: With the vote of seven, the affirmative, none, the negative, the motion passes.

428
00:34:27,083 --> 00:34:41,634
[SPEAKER_03]: C-337 offered by Vice President Lungo-Koehn be it resolved that the city council receive an update from the school department with regards to the enhancements that have been implemented with regards to drug prevention education,

429
00:34:42,128 --> 00:34:48,734
[SPEAKER_03]: in our schools since the last roundtable meeting approximately six months ago.

430
00:34:49,394 --> 00:34:50,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Madam Vice President.

431
00:34:50,475 --> 00:34:51,916
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

432
00:34:52,877 --> 00:35:03,506
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a resolution on the agenda probably six, nine months ago with regards to enhancing drug prevention within our schools.

433
00:35:03,687 --> 00:35:09,912
[SPEAKER_06]: I know there's limited amounts of prevention that are taking place currently, and I would

434
00:35:10,313 --> 00:35:12,254
[SPEAKER_06]: really like to see more prevention.

435
00:35:13,075 --> 00:35:19,640
[SPEAKER_06]: We, again, got some materials from the superintendent, which were just on our desk tonight.

436
00:35:20,841 --> 00:35:22,122
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just received it.

437
00:35:22,142 --> 00:35:23,022
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to review it.

438
00:35:23,783 --> 00:35:30,768
[SPEAKER_06]: I also know there is an upcoming addiction seminar at the high school on Saturday, April 2, which is a good step.

439
00:35:31,248 --> 00:35:35,572
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that the school committee is taking steps and having meetings with regards to prevention.

440
00:35:36,032 --> 00:35:37,433
[SPEAKER_06]: But I would like to see, you know,

441
00:35:38,348 --> 00:35:45,030
[SPEAKER_06]: more prevention within our schools and more education for our younger students, whether that be middle school, grade school, and high school.

442
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:46,790
[SPEAKER_06]: I still think we need more.

443
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:54,732
[SPEAKER_06]: And I wanted to see what type of update we could get with regards to further education, whether it's the DARE program or not.

444
00:35:55,132 --> 00:35:57,573
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that the DARE program is only given in the fifth grade.

445
00:35:57,953 --> 00:36:06,535
[SPEAKER_06]: And I believe that I, as one parent, would want my child to get more than just fifth grade education with regards to drug

446
00:36:07,013 --> 00:36:10,654
[SPEAKER_06]: drug use, alcohol prevention, drug prevention.

447
00:36:10,714 --> 00:36:15,936
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's important, especially with the state the Commonwealth and the country is in.

448
00:36:18,397 --> 00:36:24,400
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a sad state, and it's something that preventing our next generation is so important.

449
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,340
[SPEAKER_06]: It's important to, I think, all of us.

450
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:33,923
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would like an update on that, of what is in the works besides these couple steps that were listed in number 0.2 and 3.

451
00:36:37,537 --> 00:36:45,899
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, I'll review this and put anything else on the agenda or ask my questions privately to the school committee that I may have.

452
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:48,400
[SPEAKER_06]: But I still think we need to do more.

453
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,560
[SPEAKER_06]: We always need to do more.

454
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:55,602
[SPEAKER_06]: And nothing really, there hasn't been a huge push for more prevention.

455
00:36:55,782 --> 00:37:00,903
[SPEAKER_06]: Although they are active and they're taking certain steps, I think we need to do more.

456
00:37:02,522 --> 00:37:03,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

457
00:37:04,003 --> 00:37:07,846
[SPEAKER_03]: And on the motion approved by Vice President Lockern, Councilor Scarpelli.

458
00:37:08,367 --> 00:37:09,487
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

459
00:37:10,028 --> 00:37:12,910
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, I thank my colleague.

460
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:14,271
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate it.

461
00:37:14,311 --> 00:37:28,802
[SPEAKER_09]: This is something that, as we were on the school committee when you brought this up and we had the roundtable discussion with not only the school department, but also the police department and the district attorney's office.

462
00:37:28,842 --> 00:37:30,924
[SPEAKER_09]: And I thought it was a very important forum

463
00:37:31,446 --> 00:37:33,247
[SPEAKER_09]: But again, sometimes things stall.

464
00:37:33,287 --> 00:37:52,143
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think with this being such a noteworthy and important subject, I think that even talking with the chief at the time, one of the biggest issues is the effect on the middle school student and the lack of education, where the DARE program does stop in the fifth grade, and the lack of education.

465
00:37:52,183 --> 00:37:58,908
[SPEAKER_09]: And talking about following that through with the most trying years, which is sixth, seventh, and eighth grade.

466
00:38:00,268 --> 00:38:11,077
[SPEAKER_09]: there's been discussion and there's been, um, talk and maybe even wish that we look at, uh, the community policing and bringing that deer project and, and, and into the middle schools.

467
00:38:11,517 --> 00:38:28,411
[SPEAKER_09]: If we can, I'd like to send, send, um, uh, an amendment to that, to this, to the, to the chief Sacco and ask for a cost analysis and, and adding, um, more, uh, deer offices that would go into our middle schools and provide a program that will extend the, uh, the elementary program.

468
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:33,992
[SPEAKER_09]: For again, I think that the most trying years are going to be our middle school years.

469
00:38:34,032 --> 00:38:39,174
[SPEAKER_09]: So again, I appreciate my colleague for bringing that back to light, and I think it's very important.

470
00:38:39,654 --> 00:38:39,894
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

471
00:38:39,914 --> 00:38:47,317
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion for approval by Vice President Lungo-Koehn, seconded and amended by Councilor Scarpelli, that a

472
00:38:48,500 --> 00:39:08,350
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, an additional paper be sent to the chief of police to, uh, provide a cost analysis, uh, and, uh, for the addition of a, another, or an additional, uh, dear officer, uh, to serve the population of the middle schools.

473
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:08,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

474
00:39:10,411 --> 00:39:10,731
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

475
00:39:11,152 --> 00:39:11,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Counsel Falco.

476
00:39:12,592 --> 00:39:13,573
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

477
00:39:13,633 --> 00:39:17,695
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to thank a Councilor, uh, vice president current for bringing this forward tonight.

478
00:39:18,631 --> 00:39:25,555
[SPEAKER_01]: This is definitely something that we always have to keep in mind with regard to, you know, drugs and drug prevention.

479
00:39:25,575 --> 00:39:31,858
[SPEAKER_01]: And I definitely support Councilor Scarpelli's amendment with regard to the resolution.

480
00:39:32,338 --> 00:39:36,801
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is just a quick note with regard to the DA program.

481
00:39:36,881 --> 00:39:37,941
[SPEAKER_01]: I support the DA program.

482
00:39:37,981 --> 00:39:44,445
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it should go further than the fifth grade because you can never stress the importance of making good decisions.

483
00:39:44,485 --> 00:39:45,185
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also have

484
00:39:45,993 --> 00:39:49,956
[SPEAKER_01]: the Michigan model, which was implemented while I was on the school committee.

485
00:39:49,996 --> 00:39:56,580
[SPEAKER_01]: And that stresses and teaches our students about good decision-making with regards to drugs and alcohol.

486
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:59,402
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just stresses health and wellness.

487
00:39:59,422 --> 00:40:04,645
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are some supports and programs in place to stress good decision-making.

488
00:40:04,986 --> 00:40:07,407
[SPEAKER_01]: I would definitely like to see the DR program extended.

489
00:40:07,847 --> 00:40:09,188
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's definitely the way we should go.

490
00:40:09,569 --> 00:40:11,310
[SPEAKER_01]: But I definitely support this resolution.

491
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:13,231
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for bringing it forward.

492
00:40:15,535 --> 00:40:16,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor.

493
00:40:16,395 --> 00:40:17,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

494
00:40:18,016 --> 00:40:19,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

495
00:40:19,496 --> 00:40:24,338
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd like to thank Superintendent Belson publicly for his work in putting a packet together for us to review here.

496
00:40:25,238 --> 00:40:33,520
[SPEAKER_05]: In the review of this packet, I did notice that one of the steps that the City of Medford has taken is to train all of our school nurses how to administer Narcan.

497
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:42,503
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the questions that I would have for the superintendent is that that's an excellent policy to put in place, but what happens after the Narcan is administered?

498
00:40:42,543 --> 00:40:43,623
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a follow-up policy?

499
00:40:44,554 --> 00:40:55,320
[SPEAKER_05]: what controls are in place to ensure that an individual who required the administration of Narcan is going to be provided with the resources and tools to go towards recovery, Mr. President.

500
00:40:55,881 --> 00:40:59,142
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'd like to amend the paper and ask that question to the superintendent of schools as well.

501
00:40:59,983 --> 00:41:03,665
[SPEAKER_03]: As amended by Councilor Knight, Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

502
00:41:04,185 --> 00:41:09,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Lastly, if we could just get an update from our prevention coordinator, Penny.

503
00:41:10,173 --> 00:41:14,097
[SPEAKER_06]: see where she's at and what recommendations she has moving forward.

504
00:41:14,677 --> 00:41:17,940
[SPEAKER_06]: I know she's working with administrators within the school system.

505
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:31,792
[SPEAKER_06]: So it would be nice to get an update from her and what progression and what recommendations she has so that we know what recommendations to make to the school committee on top of everything that is being put in place and worked on.

506
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:38,569
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion for approval by Vice President Langevin-Kern, seconded by Scarpelli and amended by Councilor Scarpelli.

507
00:41:39,309 --> 00:41:44,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Knight and Vice President Langevin-Kern, all those in favor?

[SPEAKER_03]: Chair recognizes Councilor Falco.

548
00:44:29,238 --> 00:44:30,178
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

549
00:44:30,859 --> 00:44:37,941
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the past several months, the issue of zoning has come up during numerous conversations and phone calls I've had with residents throughout our city.

550
00:44:39,402 --> 00:44:46,485
[SPEAKER_01]: Bedford is becoming a more popular place to live with its close proximity to Boston and its abundance of green space.

551
00:44:47,013 --> 00:44:51,114
[SPEAKER_01]: Many Holtenbuyers are beginning to notice this, but developers are as well.

552
00:44:52,735 --> 00:44:59,316
[SPEAKER_01]: This resolution tonight is a proactive attempt to review our zoning and to protect the integrity of our neighborhoods and guide new development.

553
00:44:59,877 --> 00:45:03,017
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been a lot of talk lately about redeveloping Medford Square.

554
00:45:04,558 --> 00:45:09,679
[SPEAKER_01]: With the redevelopment of Medford Square, that may include mixed-use development.

555
00:45:09,919 --> 00:45:12,260
[SPEAKER_01]: It might include residential units in the square.

556
00:45:13,078 --> 00:45:17,339
[SPEAKER_01]: Developers may need additional height to make this kind of proposal work.

557
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:21,360
[SPEAKER_01]: They may not, but we need to work with the administration on this here.

558
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:27,001
[SPEAKER_01]: If you take a look over the past several weeks, there've been numerous discussions about historical properties.

559
00:45:27,921 --> 00:45:37,464
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to be protected as much as possible, but we also have to make sure that protection must be balanced against the rights of property owners.

560
00:45:38,464 --> 00:45:39,284
[SPEAKER_01]: Residential units,

561
00:45:40,025 --> 00:45:45,107
[SPEAKER_01]: If you drive through the city, you'll see residential units that have been built in industrial zones.

562
00:45:45,127 --> 00:45:46,167
[SPEAKER_01]: People have asked me about that.

563
00:45:46,227 --> 00:45:46,988
[SPEAKER_01]: How does that happen?

564
00:45:49,229 --> 00:46:01,253
[SPEAKER_01]: If you take a look at our use table, when you look at our zoning ordinances, you take a look at the most recent issues where it wasn't too long ago we had a massage parlor in Bedford Square.

565
00:46:01,493 --> 00:46:05,935
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, to me, I don't want that type of business in my downtown area.

566
00:46:06,705 --> 00:46:11,768
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are things that we need to look at, and we need to look at sooner than later.

567
00:46:11,788 --> 00:46:16,652
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think a lot of people that I've talked to said, these things probably should have been looked at years ago.

568
00:46:17,092 --> 00:46:26,578
[SPEAKER_01]: But we really need to look at them now, because there's all kinds of rumors with regard to development, major development, that's going to be happening throughout our city.

569
00:46:27,059 --> 00:46:29,540
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need to make sure that the city is zoned properly.

570
00:46:30,321 --> 00:46:33,022
[SPEAKER_01]: So of course, I support this resolution.

571
00:46:33,063 --> 00:46:35,204
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope my colleagues do as well, and they move

572
00:46:36,325 --> 00:46:39,146
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion of approval by Councilor Falco, Councilor Caraviello.

573
00:46:39,286 --> 00:46:40,086
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

574
00:46:40,746 --> 00:46:42,387
[SPEAKER_11]: I commend Councilor Falco on this idea.

575
00:46:45,368 --> 00:46:51,929
[SPEAKER_11]: When we had our meeting for our wish list, this was one of the things that was on there, was sort of getting the city under control a little bit.

576
00:46:52,590 --> 00:46:56,311
[SPEAKER_11]: If you look out in the hallway tonight, it's loaded out there with people looking to develop.

577
00:46:56,911 --> 00:47:00,692
[SPEAKER_11]: Unfortunately, the horse is out of the barn on a lot of these projects already.

578
00:47:01,212 --> 00:47:05,113
[SPEAKER_11]: But the sooner this gets done, the sooner we can rein in

579
00:47:05,805 --> 00:47:09,468
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of the newer projects coming forward, Mr. President, and I support this fully.

580
00:47:10,088 --> 00:47:10,829
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor.

581
00:47:11,489 --> 00:47:12,029
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight.

582
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:16,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I certainly have no problem reviewing our zoning and the zoning here in the city of Medford.

583
00:47:16,592 --> 00:47:17,673
[SPEAKER_05]: I do think it is due time.

584
00:47:19,194 --> 00:47:24,818
[SPEAKER_05]: However, to conduct a zoning needs analysis, I think we first need to determine what it is we're trying to accomplish.

585
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:28,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we trying to accomplish increasing the stock of affordable housing?

586
00:47:28,781 --> 00:47:30,502
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we trying to accomplish

587
00:47:31,365 --> 00:47:33,986
[SPEAKER_05]: preserving more open space or creating more open space.

588
00:47:34,707 --> 00:47:39,629
[SPEAKER_05]: We're trying to accomplish creating overlay districts so that we can have mixed use development.

589
00:47:39,709 --> 00:47:44,311
[SPEAKER_05]: So those are some of the questions that I have for the councilor, Mr. President, and I'm hoping through you that he'll be able to answer some of those.

590
00:47:45,272 --> 00:47:47,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Ultimately, we have an open space plan here in the city of Medford.

591
00:47:47,473 --> 00:47:51,195
[SPEAKER_05]: We have an affordable housing plan here in the city of Medford and many other plans that are in place.

592
00:47:51,375 --> 00:47:57,938
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that based on my reading on this, that the council would mean that we conduct a zoning needs analysis to be sure that these plans come to fruition.

593
00:47:58,782 --> 00:48:05,646
[SPEAKER_05]: However, I did have the question, and I'd feel more comfortable voting in favor of the matter if the gentleman could explain that to me a little bit better.

594
00:48:06,606 --> 00:48:26,457
[SPEAKER_03]: May I also suggest that we have a subcommittee on zoning and ordinances chaired by Councilor Knight, membered by Councilors Caraviello and Falco Jr., and perhaps we might see a motion for this matter to not only be approved, but sent to that committee for further deliberation.

595
00:48:29,065 --> 00:48:29,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a motion?

596
00:48:30,726 --> 00:48:32,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

597
00:48:33,047 --> 00:48:34,488
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

598
00:48:35,168 --> 00:48:39,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Through the chair to you, Councilor Falco, thanks for, you know, thinking this through.

599
00:48:40,111 --> 00:48:43,813
[SPEAKER_06]: But one question I have, do you know how much a consultant would cost?

600
00:48:44,893 --> 00:48:52,237
[SPEAKER_01]: A consultant would cost, I did talk to someone who said it would probably cost in the range of probably between $100,000 and $200,000, which is a lot of money.

601
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:56,774
[SPEAKER_01]: but we do not have the capacity to do it here at City Hall.

602
00:48:57,295 --> 00:48:58,276
[SPEAKER_01]: Our staffing is low.

603
00:48:58,296 --> 00:49:00,598
[SPEAKER_01]: We're at bare bones when it comes to the OCD office.

604
00:49:01,298 --> 00:49:04,501
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have, and I'm not saying that the people aren't qualified to do it.

605
00:49:05,362 --> 00:49:06,603
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think they have the time to do it.

606
00:49:06,703 --> 00:49:09,465
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have the personnel to do something like this.

607
00:49:09,926 --> 00:49:17,032
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, more and more every day you're seeing development and developers come in and they want to do all kinds of things.

608
00:49:17,993 --> 00:49:20,235
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, everybody's looking for a variance.

609
00:49:20,885 --> 00:49:25,507
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like Councilor Caraviello said tonight, you go across the hall tonight, that room's packed.

610
00:49:26,568 --> 00:49:28,208
[SPEAKER_01]: It's packed with people looking for a variance.

611
00:49:28,709 --> 00:49:34,311
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like we haven't looked at it for so long that this needs to be addressed sooner than later.

612
00:49:35,512 --> 00:49:40,914
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if my colleagues wanted to go to a subcommittee because they have more questions, I'm fine with that.

613
00:49:41,494 --> 00:49:44,436
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I want everybody to feel comfortable before they make a vote on this.

614
00:49:44,536 --> 00:49:48,418
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that this is something that really needs to be addressed sooner than later.

615
00:49:49,572 --> 00:49:50,653
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, does it cost money?

616
00:49:50,693 --> 00:49:50,933
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

617
00:49:51,433 --> 00:49:58,417
[SPEAKER_01]: But I honestly don't think we have the number of people that it'll take to really do this the right way.

618
00:49:59,277 --> 00:50:01,339
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, it's an expensive endeavor.

619
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:02,139
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, absolutely.

620
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,641
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to take a budget addition.

621
00:50:06,421 --> 00:50:06,702
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

622
00:50:06,902 --> 00:50:10,644
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to take an exercise, a, uh, a requirement to the budget.

623
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:11,384
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

624
00:50:11,644 --> 00:50:12,705
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it's long overdue.

625
00:50:12,725 --> 00:50:16,267
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't think we've taken a look at our zoning ordinances in, I would say close to,

626
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,302
[SPEAKER_01]: From what I've heard, close to 40 years.

627
00:50:18,442 --> 00:50:25,909
[SPEAKER_03]: All five public meetings we've had on the subcommittee on economic and business development of all the five major business districts in the city.

628
00:50:26,329 --> 00:50:30,973
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's one message that came out of all of them is examination of zoning.

629
00:50:31,173 --> 00:50:31,313
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

630
00:50:31,574 --> 00:50:32,715
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's consistent.

631
00:50:32,755 --> 00:50:36,038
[SPEAKER_01]: The complaints are consistent that zoning needs to be looked at.

632
00:50:36,058 --> 00:50:40,422
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we want to make sure that we develop our city properly, we need to make sure that we look at this.

633
00:50:41,382 --> 00:50:43,603
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been far too long as far as I'm concerned.

634
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:47,525
[SPEAKER_01]: It probably should have been acted on years ago, but we need to get on top of this.

635
00:50:47,645 --> 00:50:51,787
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, it's going to cost money, but I think it's an investment in our future.

636
00:50:52,207 --> 00:50:53,548
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, I take a look at it.

637
00:50:54,028 --> 00:51:00,111
[SPEAKER_01]: I really feel that at the end of the day, if we invest the money, we're really going to be protecting the integrity of our neighborhoods.

638
00:51:00,231 --> 00:51:07,914
[SPEAKER_01]: Because once we start to allow variances for heights of different buildings, you're starting to set precedent.

639
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:09,455
[SPEAKER_01]: And once you set precedent,

640
00:51:09,887 --> 00:51:13,892
[SPEAKER_01]: It just gets out of control, and that causes problems.

641
00:51:14,473 --> 00:51:20,079
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we come from the community that people look at us and say, why didn't they?

642
00:51:20,099 --> 00:51:24,605
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to become the community that they're going to say, what did they do?

643
00:51:25,086 --> 00:51:25,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

644
00:51:26,107 --> 00:51:28,570
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I'd like to move approval on this.

645
00:51:29,525 --> 00:51:30,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion for approval.

646
00:51:30,646 --> 00:51:31,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Madam Vice President.

647
00:51:31,826 --> 00:51:32,526
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree.

648
00:51:32,546 --> 00:51:34,527
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I totally understand.

649
00:51:34,547 --> 00:51:37,609
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it's something that we very well may have to spend the money on.

650
00:51:37,629 --> 00:51:50,334
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't I don't oppose that necessarily, but maybe one subcommittee meeting to like Councilor Knight said, to really discuss where we're going, where we want to go, maybe whether it's by area or district, you know, section of the city.

651
00:51:50,934 --> 00:51:56,317
[SPEAKER_06]: So that when we get, you know, quotes from a consultant, we know exactly where we're going and how we're going to get there.

652
00:51:57,377 --> 00:51:58,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

653
00:51:58,258 --> 00:51:59,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

654
00:52:00,018 --> 00:52:05,720
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I'm very reluctant to spend $200,000 or $100,000 with no specific goal in mind other than a review.

655
00:52:07,001 --> 00:52:08,221
[SPEAKER_05]: I certainly think it's a good resolution.

656
00:52:08,261 --> 00:52:10,142
[SPEAKER_05]: I certainly think it's something that needs to be looked at.

657
00:52:10,202 --> 00:52:26,507
[SPEAKER_05]: I've brought forward resolutions in the past two meetings that have discussed zoning ordinances and the way that our zoning is set up, trying to see if we can address the issue of people being able to put an extra parking spot in front of their homes even though it's in front of the home and it's not legal right now because of the zoning ordinance.

658
00:52:26,547 --> 00:52:27,588
[SPEAKER_05]: So I certainly understand what

659
00:52:28,862 --> 00:52:31,003
[SPEAKER_05]: coming from, I just think it needs to be looked at a little bit harder.

660
00:52:31,804 --> 00:52:38,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Ultimately, you know, if we want to focus our efforts just on the zoning in Medford Square, maybe we focus on just the zoning in Medford Square.

661
00:52:38,708 --> 00:52:39,509
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe that doesn't cost $200,000.

662
00:52:39,829 --> 00:52:42,511
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we can accomplish that goal by spending $25,000.

663
00:52:42,611 --> 00:52:51,676
[SPEAKER_05]: But until we really figure out what our goal is, spending the money to hire somebody with no goal at the end of the day just doesn't make sense to me, Mr. President.

664
00:52:52,217 --> 00:52:57,240
[SPEAKER_05]: But with that being said, I certainly would support the matter going to subcommittee so we can properly vet this because I think it's a noble cause.

665
00:53:01,145 --> 00:53:07,887
[SPEAKER_03]: The two motions aren't exclusive, so we can approve this and send it to subcommittee.

666
00:53:09,647 --> 00:53:11,988
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's amended to send it to subcommittee.

667
00:53:12,488 --> 00:53:13,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct, Councilor?

668
00:53:14,389 --> 00:53:14,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

669
00:53:14,889 --> 00:53:15,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Longo's motion, I believe.

670
00:53:16,089 --> 00:53:16,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

671
00:53:16,849 --> 00:53:20,310
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I think it was.

672
00:53:22,831 --> 00:53:29,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it says the administration and the city council take all measures necessary, including if it has to happen, hire an outside consultant, but I think that

673
00:53:30,287 --> 00:53:37,612
[SPEAKER_05]: If we sit down in subcommittee and try to focus our efforts on establishing goals, we might not need to go that far to hire an outside consultant to examine all the zoning.

674
00:53:37,672 --> 00:53:41,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe limit the scope of it or expand the scope of it for that matter.

675
00:53:42,175 --> 00:53:44,637
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think that there's a certain need for discussion.

676
00:53:44,657 --> 00:53:52,082
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think that the administration is going to be opposed to working with the city council to take all measures necessary to ensure that the neighborhoods in the city of Medford are protected.

677
00:53:52,342 --> 00:53:54,203
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think that this council is going to stand in the way of that either.

678
00:53:54,243 --> 00:53:56,324
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think we want to do it the right way and have a plan and a goal.

679
00:53:58,759 --> 00:54:03,420
[SPEAKER_01]: If we want to move it to Committee of the Whole, I'm completely fine with that.

680
00:54:03,801 --> 00:54:05,061
[SPEAKER_01]: People need to get more comfortable with this.

681
00:54:07,282 --> 00:54:09,403
[SPEAKER_01]: In my opinion, we need a full review.

682
00:54:10,263 --> 00:54:12,404
[SPEAKER_01]: And a full review and recommendations.

683
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:14,225
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's my opinion.

684
00:54:14,305 --> 00:54:17,466
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we want to go to a Committee of the Whole with it, I'm fine with that.

685
00:54:18,486 --> 00:54:19,747
[SPEAKER_01]: Subcommittee is fine with me.

686
00:54:19,767 --> 00:54:20,587
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do subcommittee.

687
00:54:20,727 --> 00:54:22,008
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm completely fine with that.

688
00:54:26,415 --> 00:54:29,117
[SPEAKER_03]: To approve this with it going to subcommittee on zoning.

689
00:54:29,137 --> 00:54:31,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have a roll call vote?

690
00:54:31,118 --> 00:54:34,941
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to hear from Councilor Marks first before we do anything else.

691
00:54:36,542 --> 00:54:36,942
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor.

692
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:38,743
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

693
00:54:38,923 --> 00:54:41,305
[SPEAKER_08]: And I agree with Councilor Falco.

694
00:54:41,345 --> 00:54:45,167
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this is a long sought after issue.

695
00:54:45,908 --> 00:54:53,653
[SPEAKER_08]: This council, let's not forget, we're the legislative body in this community and zoning falls under our responsibility.

696
00:54:54,313 --> 00:55:02,580
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's this council that's been neglect over the years of reviewing the zoning ordinances within our community.

697
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:07,143
[SPEAKER_08]: But I do have to say that we have department heads at City Hall for a reason.

698
00:55:07,764 --> 00:55:15,870
[SPEAKER_08]: And we have the Office of Community Development, which is the first to hear from developers that come into the community saying, we'd like to do this.

699
00:55:15,970 --> 00:55:17,371
[SPEAKER_08]: We're interested in doing that.

700
00:55:18,418 --> 00:55:22,379
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't come to the council, these developers and these business people.

701
00:55:22,679 --> 00:55:30,582
[SPEAKER_08]: They come to the city administration, the mayor, they come to the Office of Community Development, and they're the ones hearing these issues over the many, many years.

702
00:55:31,102 --> 00:55:32,822
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're the ones that should be presenting.

703
00:55:32,842 --> 00:55:36,384
[SPEAKER_08]: This has always been an issue I've had with the administration.

704
00:55:36,764 --> 00:55:47,287
[SPEAKER_08]: They should be presenting to the legislative body, like they do on the state level, the state department heads present to the legislature what they'd like to see done,

705
00:55:47,703 --> 00:55:52,895
[SPEAKER_08]: that would perhaps help the Department of Energy or the Department of Transportation.

706
00:55:53,332 --> 00:55:54,773
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how it works at the state level.

707
00:55:55,694 --> 00:56:05,162
[SPEAKER_08]: And the city, you'd never hear from a department head saying, you know what, if we created this ordinance, if we worked on amending this ordinance, it would help our community move forward.

708
00:56:05,422 --> 00:56:06,443
[SPEAKER_08]: You'd never hear that.

709
00:56:06,843 --> 00:56:12,328
[SPEAKER_08]: And the excuse of, well, there's no one really in the office of community development is no longer an excuse.

710
00:56:12,889 --> 00:56:14,570
[SPEAKER_08]: It's no longer an excuse.

711
00:56:14,930 --> 00:56:17,172
[SPEAKER_08]: So in my opinion, I agree with Councilor Knight.

712
00:56:17,192 --> 00:56:18,033
[SPEAKER_08]: I think at this point,

713
00:56:18,653 --> 00:56:46,518
[SPEAKER_08]: a meeting between us, Community Development, Lauren D. Lorenzo-Paup, and the mayor, because the mayor has a key component in the direction this city's going in, sit down and discuss what are some of the concerns that they've been hearing about some of the needs in our zoning ordinances, and hear from our department head that we're paying $110,000 to do a job, and hear from that person, rather than, and I'm not criticizing Councilor Falco,

714
00:56:46,917 --> 00:56:50,746
[SPEAKER_08]: rather than hiring a consultant at this point, I'd like to hear from our department head.

715
00:56:51,102 --> 00:56:59,706
[SPEAKER_08]: and like them to come out with a list of recommendations that would go to the subcommittee on zoning, which Councilor Knight chairs, for review by this legislative body.

716
00:57:00,227 --> 00:57:02,408
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's how we move items forward.

717
00:57:02,928 --> 00:57:14,934
[SPEAKER_08]: And to me, you never hear a department head, even during budget time, come out and make recommendations or say, geez, we'd like to see this happen in the community, but our hands are tied because of city ordinances.

718
00:57:15,334 --> 00:57:16,795
[SPEAKER_08]: You never hear that communication.

719
00:57:17,275 --> 00:57:20,497
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really unfortunate, but you never hear that type of communication.

720
00:57:21,017 --> 00:57:28,280
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, I'd like to hear from the Office of Community Development, you know, to see what can be done to improve the process.

721
00:57:29,141 --> 00:57:40,306
[SPEAKER_08]: You're right, we have many areas in this community that are commercial zone, that are residential districts, and we have another issue off of Walnut Street where someone wants to make an extra large opening for

722
00:57:41,950 --> 00:57:47,152
[SPEAKER_08]: a driveway, and it's taken at least three spots off the street, which is a major concern.

723
00:57:47,172 --> 00:57:49,492
[SPEAKER_08]: We're the only park on one side of the street already.

724
00:57:49,813 --> 00:57:54,594
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's a lot of issues that we could address as a legislative body.

725
00:57:55,114 --> 00:57:59,335
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't think we have to go out and try to, you know, move mountains.

726
00:57:59,395 --> 00:58:03,176
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we could tackle some of the issues that are presented from our department heads.

727
00:58:03,396 --> 00:58:04,997
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what they should be doing, Mr. President.

728
00:58:05,597 --> 00:58:08,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Our department heads should be coming to us saying, we'd like for you to enact

729
00:58:09,477 --> 00:58:11,858
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, the process in this city is reverse.

730
00:58:12,879 --> 00:58:14,820
[SPEAKER_08]: We get, it doesn't originate with the council.

731
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:23,685
[SPEAKER_08]: We get correspondences from the mayor with ordinances that don't have any committee input, and they just come to us for a vote.

732
00:58:24,445 --> 00:58:25,346
[SPEAKER_08]: It really is backwards.

733
00:58:25,986 --> 00:58:26,927
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't make any sense.

734
00:58:27,227 --> 00:58:28,748
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't happen on the state level that way.

735
00:58:29,068 --> 00:58:30,689
[SPEAKER_08]: It shouldn't happen on the city level that way.

736
00:58:31,449 --> 00:58:34,211
[SPEAKER_08]: So I appreciate Councilor Falco offering this.

737
00:58:34,941 --> 00:58:36,502
[SPEAKER_08]: It's definitely long sought.

738
00:58:37,043 --> 00:58:38,984
[SPEAKER_08]: Zoning is the lifeblood of a community.

739
00:58:39,745 --> 00:58:45,929
[SPEAKER_08]: It's one of the most important, besides the budget, it's probably our second most important job, the zoning of this community.

740
00:58:46,509 --> 00:58:50,552
[SPEAKER_08]: Without zoning and proper zoning, the community will go to hell, really will.

741
00:58:50,933 --> 00:58:56,577
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's probably the second most important job other than the setting of improving of the budget.

742
00:58:57,177 --> 00:59:01,400
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think we've been neglect over the years, to be quite frank, in moving

743
00:59:02,013 --> 00:59:12,102
[SPEAKER_08]: any initiatives forward, or getting the appropriate people at the table, like Councilor Falco mentioned, you know, possibly a consultant or even the Office of Community Development.

744
00:59:12,603 --> 00:59:23,673
[SPEAKER_08]: So that would be my recommendation, Mr. President, any meeting that the head of community development be present, as well as the mayor, to sit in a room and discuss issues of zoning.

745
00:59:24,318 --> 00:59:29,501
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion approved by council Falco, seconded by vice-president current as amended by council night.

746
00:59:29,561 --> 00:59:30,442
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor.

747
00:59:31,082 --> 00:59:33,303
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed.

748
00:59:33,343 --> 00:59:38,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Last night council Caraviello and I attended a special meeting at Lawrence Memorial hospital.

749
00:59:38,266 --> 00:59:42,248
[SPEAKER_03]: I know this was brought up last week by a citizen.

750
00:59:42,969 --> 00:59:49,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, and that's why it's important for us not to entertain rumors, uh, or to allow them to be broadcast here.

751
00:59:49,886 --> 00:59:53,127
[SPEAKER_03]: We met with the ruling body of doctors at the hospital.

752
00:59:53,728 --> 01:00:00,790
[SPEAKER_03]: They invited us, and it was a very interesting meeting.

753
01:00:01,711 --> 01:00:02,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's what I took out of it.

754
01:00:03,592 --> 01:00:17,277
[SPEAKER_03]: The Lawrence Memorial Hospital is committed to being a part of our community, to staying here, to serve the people, to give good medicine, and to encourage people to seek their services.

755
01:00:17,868 --> 01:00:28,995
[SPEAKER_03]: If we were to look at this from an economic standpoint, for the hospital to survive in MedFed, given the way healthcare has gone in this past decade, they need customers.

756
01:00:29,435 --> 01:00:32,497
[SPEAKER_03]: And people, if they want the hospital to survive,

757
01:00:32,941 --> 01:00:38,442
[SPEAKER_03]: and stay in Medford and provide the services that it does and even more, then we've got to give them our business.

758
01:00:39,023 --> 01:00:49,665
[SPEAKER_03]: They are committed to and have undertaken a number of constant projects to improve, repair, develop, and build for the future its infrastructure.

759
01:00:50,485 --> 01:00:52,786
[SPEAKER_03]: They've replaced all their electrical service.

760
01:00:53,166 --> 01:00:55,767
[SPEAKER_03]: They put in new tanks for their fuel.

761
01:00:56,527 --> 01:01:00,408
[SPEAKER_03]: They've undergone major inspection process to be accredited.

762
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:04,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Their operating room is open five days a week for surgery.

763
01:01:05,423 --> 01:01:07,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Five days a week.

764
01:01:07,765 --> 01:01:15,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Their sleep lab is working at capacity as well as the bariatric medicine department.

765
01:01:16,242 --> 01:01:17,923
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're having tremendous success.

766
01:01:19,063 --> 01:01:21,004
[SPEAKER_03]: They're here.

767
01:01:21,504 --> 01:01:25,766
[SPEAKER_03]: They weren't at Liberty to discuss who they're in discussions with, but they are.

768
01:01:26,586 --> 01:01:29,347
[SPEAKER_03]: But they want to be a part of MedFed.

769
01:01:29,667 --> 01:01:30,788
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to stay here.

770
01:01:31,128 --> 01:01:33,248
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to provide services for people.

771
01:01:33,609 --> 01:01:40,951
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to be an institution that hires citizens of MedFed and provides top-notch health care to this community.

772
01:01:41,251 --> 01:01:42,512
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can be grateful for that.

773
01:01:43,009 --> 01:01:46,691
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize for interjecting in the regular order of business.

774
01:01:46,711 --> 01:02:12,363
[SPEAKER_03]: 16-339 offered by Councilor Falco, whereas the City of Medford will seek funding through the Commonwealth's Complete Streets Program, whereas our children slash students are forced to walk on the street when traversing city-owned sidewalks during snowstorms, whereas our pedestrian and bicyclist community is continuously growing, be it resolved that the City of Medford purchase

775
01:02:12,861 --> 01:02:24,489
[SPEAKER_03]: a trackless plow to remove snow from city-owned sidewalks and property during inclement weather and give our DPW department the tools they need to succeed.

776
01:02:24,869 --> 01:02:28,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Falco, what is a trackless plow?

777
01:02:28,852 --> 01:02:30,052
[SPEAKER_03]: How is it, what does it float?

778
01:02:31,153 --> 01:02:32,314
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

779
01:02:32,414 --> 01:02:33,395
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for asking.

780
01:02:34,856 --> 01:02:37,878
[SPEAKER_01]: I have received, you know, when I was a member of the school committee,

781
01:02:39,365 --> 01:02:49,551
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and now even as a member of the council, you know, I received calls, and this winter hasn't been bad, but you look at past winters, and, you know, we always encourage our residents, make sure you shovel your sidewalks.

782
01:02:50,051 --> 01:02:53,713
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you get in front, you know, remove the snow so people aren't forced out into the streets.

783
01:02:54,894 --> 01:02:59,317
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I think that the city should be, you know, held to the same standard.

784
01:02:59,397 --> 01:03:06,201
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we have plenty of sidewalks that go right by city property, they're not plowed, and, you know,

785
01:03:07,175 --> 01:03:10,216
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need something, you know, we need a piece of equipment to do this.

786
01:03:10,256 --> 01:03:20,060
[SPEAKER_01]: I called the DPW and did my homework and asked them, do you have something that specifically plows sidewalks or removes some snow from sidewalks?

787
01:03:20,321 --> 01:03:24,963
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said they do not have a specific piece of equipment that does that.

788
01:03:24,983 --> 01:03:30,205
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said that the equipment that they use actually doesn't really work well at removing snow from sidewalks.

789
01:03:30,985 --> 01:03:35,207
[SPEAKER_01]: So this track box plow is basically, it's a smaller version of a larger plow.

790
01:03:36,012 --> 01:03:38,494
[SPEAKER_01]: I have pictures if you'd like to see them, awesome.

791
01:03:38,974 --> 01:03:45,398
[SPEAKER_01]: But what you do is this plow, it does not have to be moved from different parts of the city.

792
01:03:45,458 --> 01:03:49,641
[SPEAKER_01]: This thing can actually just go, for example, the DCR has a trackless plow.

793
01:03:50,081 --> 01:03:58,767
[SPEAKER_01]: They started in Stoneham, it comes all the way down on the sidewalk, all the way down Route 28, down the Fellsway, down towards Wellington, up Route 16.

794
01:03:59,067 --> 01:04:00,928
[SPEAKER_01]: So it basically goes on a continuous loop.

795
01:04:01,669 --> 01:04:05,291
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we need to do, I feel, is we need to actually have a piece of equipment like this.

796
01:04:06,350 --> 01:04:09,391
[SPEAKER_01]: to clear our streets, or to clear our sidewalks.

797
01:04:09,431 --> 01:04:13,512
[SPEAKER_01]: We stress the importance of being healthy and walking and bicycling.

798
01:04:13,552 --> 01:04:18,953
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that this will go a long way in helping our residents stay safe during the winter.

799
01:04:19,433 --> 01:04:22,354
[SPEAKER_01]: But this piece of equipment is not just for snow.

800
01:04:22,814 --> 01:04:25,915
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's efficient that it can be used for other things.

801
01:04:25,995 --> 01:04:27,715
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be used to mow lawns.

802
01:04:28,255 --> 01:04:32,036
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be used as a leaf loader, a front end loader, a stump grinder, an auger.

803
01:04:32,436 --> 01:04:34,257
[SPEAKER_01]: So definitely, it can be used for

804
01:04:35,609 --> 01:04:36,510
[SPEAKER_01]: different situation.

805
01:04:36,550 --> 01:04:44,476
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not just for the snow, but it will go a long way in keeping our, um, keeping our residents safe, keeping our sidewalks clear.

806
01:04:44,896 --> 01:04:51,100
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, we should, our city should be held to the same standard that residents are held to, uh, with regard to removing snow.

807
01:04:51,541 --> 01:04:53,502
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, I'd like to move for approval on this.

808
01:04:53,922 --> 01:04:57,505
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion approved by Councilor Falco, Councilor Scarpelli.

809
01:04:58,185 --> 01:05:00,267
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President, to follow along with that.

810
01:05:00,307 --> 01:05:01,908
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, uh, Councilor Falco.

811
01:05:01,928 --> 01:05:02,969
[SPEAKER_09]: But, uh, I know I,

812
01:05:03,662 --> 01:05:11,368
[SPEAKER_09]: I had the recommendation of motion that asking for a list of equipment from our DPW a while back, still haven't received that.

813
01:05:11,849 --> 01:05:17,533
[SPEAKER_09]: As we move to budget seizing, I think it'll be imperative that we know what we're in need of.

814
01:05:18,594 --> 01:05:24,119
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know the trackless piece of apparatus is very important.

815
01:05:24,179 --> 01:05:25,600
[SPEAKER_09]: We use it in the neighboring community.

816
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:31,605
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of the biggest things around the park areas is they go around the park areas, so it's very important.

817
01:05:32,165 --> 01:05:42,371
[SPEAKER_09]: I could see the benefit, but at the same time, um, you know, uh, I I've heard, you know, there's talk that they're using plywood to patch our beds of our Sanders.

818
01:05:42,431 --> 01:05:43,912
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'd like to get an update.

819
01:05:43,972 --> 01:05:56,179
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that we've asked, but to get an update from our acting DPW director and what we, what we're looking for for equipment and you know, what, what their life expectancy are, if not have already passed.

820
01:05:56,259 --> 01:05:57,279
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you.

821
01:05:57,620 --> 01:06:00,001
[SPEAKER_03]: So on the motion for approval by council Falco,

822
01:06:00,622 --> 01:06:14,813
[SPEAKER_03]: and amended by council Scarpelli that the department of public works report back to the city council with an assessment and a audit of all its equipment and what's needed for update and replacement.

823
01:06:15,033 --> 01:06:15,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

824
01:06:15,654 --> 01:06:17,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, chair recognizes councilors Caraviello.

825
01:06:18,256 --> 01:06:18,616
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

826
01:06:18,636 --> 01:06:19,397
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

827
01:06:19,957 --> 01:06:23,120
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, you know, uh, this is something that I think we've recommended in the past.

828
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:29,685
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I'm, I'm also in favor of, uh, these, these seven machines doing our business districts.

829
01:06:30,406 --> 01:06:40,029
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, this year hasn't been that bad, but in the past, you drive around, you walk around the squares and there's like little tiny paths because business owners don't do it.

830
01:06:40,750 --> 01:06:45,852
[SPEAKER_11]: I go to other cities and you see that all the business areas are cleaned by the city.

831
01:06:46,412 --> 01:06:53,414
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, that's one thing I've always been in favor of, and I hope that that's something that this machine would do, or a couple of machines would do.

832
01:06:54,375 --> 01:06:55,555
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would support this a lot.

833
01:06:57,723 --> 01:06:59,145
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, motion for approval.

834
01:06:59,245 --> 01:07:00,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Falco.

835
01:07:00,646 --> 01:07:01,447
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

836
01:07:01,527 --> 01:07:05,412
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there's one thing if I could add, uh, Mr. Scarpelli did actually ask for the list.

837
01:07:06,012 --> 01:07:15,142
[SPEAKER_01]: If we could have, when they supply the list, if they could supply the date, the year, the, the year of the vehicle, just so we know how old the equipment is.

838
01:07:15,162 --> 01:07:19,627
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that'd be a go a long way and just trying to determine, um, you know,

839
01:07:20,357 --> 01:07:21,898
[SPEAKER_01]: where we are with regards to the equipment.

840
01:07:21,958 --> 01:07:23,199
[SPEAKER_03]: It's further remitted by council's health.

841
01:07:23,459 --> 01:07:24,800
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've had that list before.

842
01:07:24,820 --> 01:07:30,663
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say about three years ago, we got, uh, we got a list of everything that they had in the stable.

843
01:07:31,343 --> 01:07:33,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and it's pretty impressive.

844
01:07:33,104 --> 01:07:40,028
[SPEAKER_03]: And people have been quick to point out too, that the date doesn't mean that, you know, the milk's gone sour either.

845
01:07:40,488 --> 01:07:40,829
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

846
01:07:40,929 --> 01:07:41,389
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

847
01:07:41,929 --> 01:07:44,251
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually, um, I had Friday off.

848
01:07:44,311 --> 01:07:46,812
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went down to the DPW yard and, uh,

849
01:07:47,345 --> 01:07:51,608
[SPEAKER_01]: They have some old equipment down there, but actually some of it is quite useful.

850
01:07:51,628 --> 01:07:55,891
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually have a snow, they showed it to me, it's actually a snow thrower from 1972.

851
01:07:56,772 --> 01:07:59,654
[SPEAKER_01]: But they said it's one of the best pieces of equipment that they have.

852
01:07:59,694 --> 01:08:01,355
[SPEAKER_01]: It literally just, it's a giant snowball.

853
01:08:02,075 --> 01:08:04,257
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're right.

854
01:08:04,377 --> 01:08:11,482
[SPEAKER_01]: With regard to some equipment, I think it's good to know though, if you're driving around a pickup truck from 1994, that could be an issue.

855
01:08:12,123 --> 01:08:15,165
[SPEAKER_01]: So especially if you're hauling different types of material around.

856
01:08:15,868 --> 01:08:21,893
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know they definitely are in some need of equipment down there, and it'd be great to get a wish list from them to see what they actually need.

857
01:08:22,354 --> 01:08:22,634
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.

858
01:08:23,335 --> 01:08:23,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight.

859
01:08:24,375 --> 01:08:33,123
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, while we're talking snow, I think it might make sense for us to request, so I'd like to amend the paper, that the DPW director report back the status of our snow and ice budget.

860
01:08:33,643 --> 01:08:34,024
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good.

861
01:08:35,125 --> 01:08:44,513
[SPEAKER_03]: So as amended, that the DPW director report back to us, amended by Councilor Knight, as to the status of the snow and ice budget.

862
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:46,880
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening.

863
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:47,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome.

864
01:08:47,860 --> 01:08:49,381
[SPEAKER_12]: Please state your name and address for the record.

865
01:08:49,401 --> 01:08:49,761
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening.

866
01:08:50,161 --> 01:08:52,082
[SPEAKER_12]: Nick Tomazook, 29 Garfield Ave.

867
01:08:53,662 --> 01:08:56,903
[SPEAKER_12]: I was looking at that snow sidewalk plow there.

868
01:08:58,004 --> 01:09:01,285
[SPEAKER_12]: Wouldn't it be more feasible to get a bobcat with a snowplow attachment?

869
01:09:02,485 --> 01:09:07,347
[SPEAKER_12]: And that way there you could put a bucket on it during the summer and the DPW would have a use of a bobcat?

870
01:09:08,327 --> 01:09:10,227
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I know they have bobcats.

871
01:09:10,267 --> 01:09:12,068
[SPEAKER_12]: That's kind of overkill for sidewalks.

872
01:09:13,008 --> 01:09:23,152
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, from what I hear, and I'm not a professional when it comes to this type of equipment, but I mean, from what I hear, using a bobcat to clear sidewalks is not really an efficient way.

873
01:09:23,192 --> 01:09:29,435
[SPEAKER_12]: No, just for the snow, the same angle plug it has here, put it in front of the bobcat.

874
01:09:29,915 --> 01:09:31,596
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not talking about using a bucket.

875
01:09:32,576 --> 01:09:33,577
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm talking about getting the...

876
01:09:34,836 --> 01:09:37,539
[SPEAKER_12]: the sidewalk attachment and put it on the bobcat.

877
01:09:37,819 --> 01:09:43,804
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that Bob, from what I hear, I think the bobcat is, it might be actually too large for sidewalks from what I've heard.

878
01:09:44,065 --> 01:09:46,407
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but then again, I mean, like I will definitely admit.

879
01:09:46,427 --> 01:09:47,368
[SPEAKER_12]: That looks just as wide.

880
01:09:47,908 --> 01:09:49,930
[SPEAKER_01]: This is actually, you can take a look if you want.

881
01:09:49,970 --> 01:09:50,771
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it doesn't seem,

882
01:09:51,841 --> 01:09:53,702
[SPEAKER_01]: Terribly wide.

883
01:09:54,502 --> 01:09:58,703
[SPEAKER_12]: That way you could use a vehicle for two things instead of just using it for the winter.

884
01:09:58,863 --> 01:09:59,903
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's not just for the winter.

885
01:10:00,264 --> 01:10:01,824
[SPEAKER_01]: This actually can be used as a mower.

886
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:03,124
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be used as a front loader.

887
01:10:03,165 --> 01:10:04,925
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be used as an auger, a stump grinder.

888
01:10:05,265 --> 01:10:07,566
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I was trying to point out.

889
01:10:07,606 --> 01:10:09,626
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an efficient piece of equipment where it can be used.

890
01:10:10,267 --> 01:10:12,847
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just for the winter season.

891
01:10:12,908 --> 01:10:14,468
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be used throughout the year.

892
01:10:14,862 --> 01:10:16,363
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, absolutely.

893
01:10:16,423 --> 01:10:18,664
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand your questions and you bring up a good point.

894
01:10:18,904 --> 01:10:21,506
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I'm sure that we have a Bobcat down at the city yards.

895
01:10:21,526 --> 01:10:24,147
[SPEAKER_12]: We'd need the angle plow.

896
01:10:25,308 --> 01:10:25,908
[SPEAKER_12]: Nope.

897
01:10:26,989 --> 01:10:28,290
[SPEAKER_12]: Got everything else down there.

898
01:10:29,730 --> 01:10:30,091
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

899
01:10:30,371 --> 01:10:30,931
[SPEAKER_12]: Very good.

900
01:10:30,951 --> 01:10:31,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

901
01:10:31,852 --> 01:10:39,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, I'd like to further amend the paper to request that the highway superintendent make recommendations as to what the proper equipment would be to use to clean it, to clear a sidewalk.

902
01:10:39,596 --> 01:10:41,537
[SPEAKER_03]: As further amended by Councilor Knight.

903
01:10:41,557 --> 01:10:43,278
[SPEAKER_03]: So on the motion approved by Councilor Falco,

904
01:10:43,738 --> 01:10:51,344
[SPEAKER_03]: as amended by Councilors, Scarpelli, Councilor Knight and Councilor Knight.

905
01:10:51,764 --> 01:10:52,505
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor.

906
01:10:53,025 --> 01:10:54,626
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed.

907
01:10:54,646 --> 01:10:56,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations.

908
01:10:56,708 --> 01:10:58,850
[SPEAKER_03]: 16-three 41 off by council.

909
01:10:58,870 --> 01:11:06,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Gary yellow be resolved that the city council discuss the recent article regarding the regional nine one one system.

910
01:11:06,676 --> 01:11:07,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Caraviello.

911
01:11:07,997 --> 01:11:08,237
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

912
01:11:08,257 --> 01:11:08,777
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President.

913
01:11:08,817 --> 01:11:11,159
[SPEAKER_11]: Tom, in this week's newspaper,

914
01:11:12,477 --> 01:11:16,400
[SPEAKER_11]: They had the recent article regarding the regional 9-1-1 system.

915
01:11:16,441 --> 01:11:21,384
[SPEAKER_11]: I know we've talked about it in the past, and in the past I think it was up to 1.11 cities.

916
01:11:22,345 --> 01:11:23,226
[SPEAKER_11]: Now it's down to three.

917
01:11:24,347 --> 01:11:31,012
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you read the article, Mayor Dolan from Melrose seems a little cool on the idea now, too.

918
01:11:31,692 --> 01:11:41,220
[SPEAKER_11]: I would like to refer this to the Public Safety Subcommittee so we could have our chief, Gil Birdy and Sacco come down, and along with the budget director,

919
01:11:42,215 --> 01:11:50,096
[SPEAKER_11]: so we can discuss the pros, cons of this, and the savings implications of this, Mr. President.

920
01:11:50,917 --> 01:11:51,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good.

921
01:11:51,257 --> 01:11:56,277
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion of Councilor Caraviello, let this matter be sent to the Subcommittee on Public Safety.

922
01:11:56,478 --> 01:12:03,839
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President also, if we could have a meeting within the next 30 days before the budget season, it would be appreciated.

923
01:12:04,399 --> 01:12:10,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Public safety is chaired by Councilor Knight.

924
01:12:11,896 --> 01:12:19,478
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Chairman, after consultation with the other members on the subcommittee, we'd be willing to meet on the 19th of April at 6 p.m.

925
01:12:19,738 --> 01:12:21,519
[SPEAKER_05]: in the council committee room.

926
01:12:21,919 --> 01:12:22,819
[SPEAKER_05]: What night of the week is that?

927
01:12:23,399 --> 01:12:26,820
[SPEAKER_05]: That is a Tuesday evening, and we'd ask the city clerk to post the notices.

928
01:12:27,981 --> 01:12:33,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion that the Tuesday night, April... Excuse me, Councilor Layton.

929
01:12:33,689 --> 01:12:35,671
[SPEAKER_03]: What night of the week was that?

930
01:12:35,751 --> 01:12:36,591
[SPEAKER_03]: The 19th, Tuesday.

931
01:12:37,132 --> 01:12:43,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, this is all contingent on being able to secure the folks from the administration to be able to attend.

932
01:12:43,717 --> 01:12:44,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good.

933
01:12:44,438 --> 01:12:46,219
[SPEAKER_03]: With that contingency, all those in favor?

934
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:47,160
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

935
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:47,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion carries.

936
01:12:49,122 --> 01:12:56,088
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion of Councilor Caraviello that we take the papers in hand of the clerk.

937
01:12:56,128 --> 01:12:56,948
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

938
01:12:57,529 --> 01:12:58,269
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

939
01:12:58,350 --> 01:12:58,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion carries.

940
01:12:59,611 --> 01:13:02,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Metro City Council

941
01:13:02,967 --> 01:13:14,393
[SPEAKER_03]: congratulate Donner and James Basile on the momentous occasion of their 40th wedding anniversary.

942
01:13:14,453 --> 01:13:15,093
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight.

943
01:13:15,873 --> 01:13:16,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

944
01:13:16,394 --> 01:13:25,958
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, Mr. And Mrs. Basile have been long friends of mine, uh, going back to my early days in high school when I befriended their son Jimmy and, uh, they opened their home to me, Mr. President.

945
01:13:26,099 --> 01:13:29,020
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, this past weekend at Carol's diner,

946
01:13:29,615 --> 01:13:33,339
[SPEAKER_05]: at Carol's Restaurant, they celebrated their 40th wedding anniversary.

947
01:13:34,139 --> 01:13:40,505
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's very fitting that they had the celebration at Carol's Restaurant because in 1975, they actually met.

948
01:13:42,667 --> 01:13:45,928
[SPEAKER_05]: at carol's restaurant and began dating shortly thereafter.

949
01:13:45,968 --> 01:13:46,768
[SPEAKER_05]: We're married at St.

950
01:13:46,808 --> 01:13:49,049
[SPEAKER_05]: James church over in Councilor mox's neighborhood.

951
01:13:49,689 --> 01:13:51,290
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, the rest is history.

952
01:13:51,370 --> 01:13:57,091
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, they've raised two beautiful children, two great, great, great kids, Jason and James, who were very close friends of mine.

953
01:13:57,111 --> 01:14:00,732
[SPEAKER_05]: And they have three beautiful grandchildren, Ana, Mia and Madison.

954
01:14:01,292 --> 01:14:08,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so I'd like to wish daughter and Jim a very happy 40th wedding anniversary and, uh, God bless them both on motion approved by Councilor Knight.

955
01:14:09,815 --> 01:14:10,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Seconded by

956
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:12,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Lundgren, all those in favor?

957
01:14:13,556 --> 01:14:14,257
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

958
01:14:14,557 --> 01:14:15,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy anniversary.

959
01:14:16,298 --> 01:14:26,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it resolved that the Police Traffic Division increase enforcement on Ridgeway Road of resident access only restrictions offered by Councilor Knight.

960
01:14:26,743 --> 01:14:27,364
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Councilor?

961
01:14:27,844 --> 01:14:28,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Mr. President.

962
01:14:28,684 --> 01:14:35,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Last week, a gentleman from Ridgeway Road was here and we had some discussions about some of the problems relative to traffic that he's having on his roadway.

963
01:14:36,077 --> 01:14:47,701
[SPEAKER_05]: There's also several residents on Upland and Leonard Circle who have called concerning the amount of vehicles, meaning volume, as well as the speed of vehicles that are traveling up and down that road.

964
01:14:48,682 --> 01:14:54,504
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody who knows Ridgeway Road knows it runs from Fulton to the Fells Way, is a major cut through street.

965
01:14:55,104 --> 01:15:02,927
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are posted signs that would say that it's resident access only for certain hours, very similar to the recommendation that this council made.

966
01:15:03,444 --> 01:15:06,907
[SPEAKER_05]: on behalf of Councilor Marksley's resolution for Oakland Street, Mr. President.

967
01:15:06,947 --> 01:15:15,133
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm asking that the Traffic Division of our Medford Police Department direct some patrols during the rush hour times of day at that location.

968
01:15:15,694 --> 01:15:23,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Driving down a resident-only roadway when it's clearly posted that it's only for resident access is actually a surchargeable offense, Mr. President.

969
01:15:23,820 --> 01:15:31,306
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think people that are using this road as a cut-through will learn very quick when they get an insurance surcharge that they should obey the signage that's on the street.

970
01:15:31,977 --> 01:15:34,058
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that being said, I move for approval, Mr. President.

971
01:15:34,418 --> 01:15:35,759
[SPEAKER_03]: I move for approval by Councilor Knight.

972
01:15:35,799 --> 01:15:36,399
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

973
01:15:36,819 --> 01:15:37,360
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

974
01:15:37,420 --> 01:15:38,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion carries.

975
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:40,361
[SPEAKER_03]: Offered by Vice President Lundgel-Kern.

976
01:15:40,421 --> 01:15:51,686
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council be updated with regards to the deadlines applicable to CPA abatement applications.

977
01:15:52,226 --> 01:15:58,689
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it further resolved that if the deadline is within the next couple of weeks, that it be extended

978
01:15:59,245 --> 01:16:01,666
[SPEAKER_03]: and advertised to create awareness of such.

979
01:16:01,766 --> 01:16:02,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Madam Vice President.

980
01:16:03,007 --> 01:16:04,267
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

981
01:16:04,528 --> 01:16:11,251
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure if any of my colleagues can answer that question, because I know there's a few that are on a subcommittee that are working hard to implement the CPA.

982
01:16:11,691 --> 01:16:20,995
[SPEAKER_06]: But from what I heard yesterday, somebody went to apply for an abatement and was told that applications for an abatement are due this Thursday, the 31st.

983
01:16:21,295 --> 01:16:22,416
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the first I heard of it.

984
01:16:22,476 --> 01:16:25,237
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure if anybody else is aware of when the deadline is.

985
01:16:25,717 --> 01:16:26,858
[SPEAKER_06]: But if a senior or...

986
01:16:28,205 --> 01:16:30,827
[SPEAKER_06]: low income wants to apply for an abatement.

987
01:16:31,648 --> 01:16:41,376
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like it's something that should be advertised and people should have notice and there should be, you know, obviously more time given considering the fact that, you know, I wasn't aware of it.

988
01:16:41,396 --> 01:16:43,958
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm not sure this resident wasn't aware of it.

989
01:16:44,038 --> 01:16:56,188
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we could just get an update on that and if so, if Thursday is the deadline, if we could look into just extending that for a few weeks so that people can be notified, it can be advertised and it can be obviously

990
01:16:56,709 --> 01:16:59,891
[SPEAKER_06]: open to the general public after advertisement.

991
01:16:59,991 --> 01:17:00,772
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be helpful.

992
01:17:00,872 --> 01:17:01,772
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

993
01:17:01,792 --> 01:17:04,614
[SPEAKER_03]: The motion is approved by Council Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

994
01:17:05,374 --> 01:17:05,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight.

995
01:17:06,515 --> 01:17:07,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

996
01:17:07,536 --> 01:17:10,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Chairman of the CPA Implementation Program.

997
01:17:10,417 --> 01:17:14,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Mr. President, thank you very much, and thank you, Councilor Lungo-Koehn, for bringing this issue up.

998
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:19,143
[SPEAKER_05]: The assessor's office will be handling the notification issues.

999
01:17:19,163 --> 01:17:25,687
[SPEAKER_05]: The role of the Community Preservation Act Ad Hoc Subcommittee is to create the

1000
01:17:26,632 --> 01:17:39,260
[SPEAKER_05]: mandated community preservation commission and the structure thereof, which would focus on whether or not there are term limits, how the people are selected, the criteria for selection, so on and so forth.

1001
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:47,665
[SPEAKER_05]: So the subcommittee has not had any dealings with the administration relative to the issuance of variances, so on and so forth.

1002
01:17:47,705 --> 01:17:49,446
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's part of the legislation that was passed.

1003
01:17:50,510 --> 01:17:55,952
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that that's something that's a little bit outside the scope of what the Ad Hoc Subcommittee on the CPA is doing.

1004
01:17:56,112 --> 01:18:09,135
[SPEAKER_05]: What we're doing here is creating a list of recommended proposals for the general public to give, provide input on, and then for the city council to examine and then make decisions with all this information that they have.

1005
01:18:09,516 --> 01:18:14,317
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that being said, I guess it's a really long, long, long way of telling Councilor Longo no.

1006
01:18:15,233 --> 01:18:18,736
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have any information on that.

1007
01:18:18,956 --> 01:18:19,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1008
01:18:19,396 --> 01:18:20,397
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for the update.

1009
01:18:20,457 --> 01:18:28,844
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we could request an update from the assessor's office when the application deadline is and if it could be extended if the deadline is actually this week.

1010
01:18:29,404 --> 01:18:35,069
[SPEAKER_06]: I really feel that people need to be notified with regards to when the deadline is, how to apply for an abatement.

1011
01:18:35,429 --> 01:18:43,055
[SPEAKER_06]: There are low income residents who want to apply for abatement and it's only fair that they be notified accordingly and have the time to

1012
01:18:43,485 --> 01:18:46,388
[SPEAKER_06]: fill out the application, apply for the abatement, and so forth.

1013
01:18:46,869 --> 01:18:52,134
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion approved by Vice President Locke-Curran, Mrs. Citizen, welcome.

1014
01:18:52,535 --> 01:18:54,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Please share with us your name and address for the record.

1015
01:18:54,915 --> 01:18:56,636
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street.

1016
01:18:57,496 --> 01:18:59,677
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been following the CPA closely.

1017
01:18:59,697 --> 01:19:00,637
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been to the meetings.

1018
01:19:00,697 --> 01:19:03,658
[SPEAKER_00]: I did ask this exact question approximately one month ago.

1019
01:19:04,179 --> 01:19:17,624
[SPEAKER_00]: I requested that the administration make a great effort to notify the citizens that they needed to apply for this abatement because a lot of information that went out before the election made it seem like this was a magical, automatic abatement, and it is not.

1020
01:19:18,548 --> 01:19:26,854
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's enough to put, they were talking about a different color sheet of paper would go in your bill to tell you to come in to apply for this abatement.

1021
01:19:26,874 --> 01:19:35,000
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there needs to be some kind of an open community meeting where people can come and be told how to apply for this abatement and actually apply for it.

1022
01:19:35,420 --> 01:19:41,424
[SPEAKER_00]: City Hall is open late, one night a week, that would be a perfect night to have people come in and say, we'll help you file for this.

1023
01:19:42,165 --> 01:19:45,427
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a tax, a surcharge that people voted in

1024
01:19:46,484 --> 01:19:54,186
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to make sure that the citizens that are not supposed to have to pay this are protected and not having to pay this.

1025
01:19:54,206 --> 01:19:56,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1026
01:19:56,447 --> 01:19:59,068
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion approved by Vice President Leclerc, all those in favor?

1027
01:19:59,608 --> 01:20:00,168
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

1028
01:20:00,709 --> 01:20:01,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion carries.

1029
01:20:02,009 --> 01:20:14,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Next week, councillors, the 5th of April at 5.30, we're going to have our Committee of the Whole meeting to discuss the CDBG public service proposals

1030
01:20:15,620 --> 01:20:31,272
[SPEAKER_03]: and conference, uh, the, uh, community block grant, uh, uh, proposals, uh, for, um, uh, the social service organizations that we, uh, entertain, uh, for the block grants.

1031
01:20:31,932 --> 01:20:39,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, so we also have our notification for our, uh, conflict of interest statements that we should be aware of, uh, as we go about this business.

1032
01:20:40,339 --> 01:20:43,481
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, um, we've all received our packets tonight.

1033
01:20:43,938 --> 01:20:44,819
[SPEAKER_03]: We're at our places.

1034
01:20:44,899 --> 01:20:52,926
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's plenty of material for those organizations, uh, to, uh, for us to prepare ourselves with so that we can have a fruitful discussion.

1035
01:20:53,526 --> 01:20:57,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, next Tuesday night at five 30 and dinner will be served.

1036
01:20:58,550 --> 01:21:06,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, the records, the tabled records of the meeting of March 15th, 2016 were passed to Councilor Marks.

1037
01:21:06,717 --> 01:21:08,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, Mr. Councilor, how did you find those records?

1038
01:21:09,457 --> 01:21:12,019
[SPEAKER_03]: Review the records, find them to be in order, and move approval.

1039
01:21:12,379 --> 01:21:19,003
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion for approval for the March 15th records by Councilor Marks, all those in favor?

1040
01:21:19,544 --> 01:21:20,344
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

01:21:21,765 --> 01:21:22,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Records are accepted.

[SPEAKER_03]: The records for the meeting of March 22nd, 2016 are passed to Councilor Scarpelli.

1043
01:21:27,929 --> 01:21:29,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli, how do you find those records?

1044
01:21:30,030 --> 01:21:31,832
[SPEAKER_03]: I find the papers in order, move for approval.

1045
01:21:32,092 --> 01:21:35,414
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion for approval of the records by Councilor Scarpelli, all those in favor?

1046
01:21:35,774 --> 01:21:36,555

[SPEAKER_03]: The records are

[SPEAKER_09]: If I can, Mr. President, I know that Friday night we have a community event that is supporting a method family, it's a Russo family, we're at the elks, Friday night at 6 o'clock.

1050
01:21:57,394 --> 01:22:07,101
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that with the help of Councilor Knight and some others, we're putting together a fundraiser for a young family whose dad was in a

1051
01:22:07,577 --> 01:22:11,478
[SPEAKER_09]: severe motorcycle accident and left an assisted living.

1052
01:22:12,079 --> 01:22:29,485
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're now putting together, we've worked with different organizations and Friday night's a celebration and hoping that residents can come out and join us for a little food and dance and support the Russo family.

1053
01:22:29,545 --> 01:22:31,146
[SPEAKER_09]: So just want to let you know.

01:22:38,654 --> 01:22:40,436
