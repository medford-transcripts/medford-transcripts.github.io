1
00:01:07,512 --> 00:01:35,182
If you could stay standing, please, to admit the honorable elected members of the Medford City Council, Isaac B. Zack Bares, Anna Callahan, Kit Collins, Emily Lazaro, Matt Lemming, George Scarpelli, and Justin Sang.

2
00:01:45,575 --> 00:01:47,018
Congratulations to all.

3
00:01:47,038 --> 00:01:55,836
If you could please stay standing to admit the Honorable 32nd Mayor of the City of Medford, Brianna Lungo Kern.

4
00:02:16,067 --> 00:02:20,012
For those of you that I haven't yet met, I am Terry E. Cotter.

5
00:02:20,172 --> 00:02:30,425
I was born in Medford, raised in the historic West Medford community we call The Ville, and educated in the Medford public schools.

6
00:02:31,146 --> 00:02:31,626
They work.

7
00:02:32,924 --> 00:02:40,770
I worked just a little ways from here at the West Medford Community Center and am very proud to call myself a Medfordite.

8
00:02:41,691 --> 00:02:53,160
I became the city's inaugural poet laureate in 2021 and served two eventful years promoting the art of poetry across the city in a variety of rhythms, rhymes, and riddles.

9
00:02:54,383 --> 00:03:12,502
Tonight, after being delayed by a snowy Sunday morning, we are here to celebrate and charge the recently elected Mayor, City Council, and School Committee with the ever-evolving business of running one of the Commonwealth's most amazing and historic cities.

10
00:03:13,653 --> 00:03:19,674
My role in all of this will mostly be to let you know what comes next and keep things moving along.

11
00:03:20,494 --> 00:03:37,578
So to everyone here with us in the council chambers and to everyone at home watching on Medford Community Media, we're so glad that you could join us for this peaceful exercise of representative democracy in our old hometown.

12
00:03:47,662 --> 00:04:01,727
Before we begin, let me say thank you to Bessie Pace and members of the Medford Community Chorale and Youth and Young Adult Chorus, as well as flutist Michelle Corrado and the accompanist, I didn't get her name.

13
00:04:03,428 --> 00:04:04,248
Bunny Tabaski.

14
00:04:04,288 --> 00:04:05,368
Bunny Tabaski.

15
00:04:05,528 --> 00:04:12,131
For their wonderful prelude to Set the Atmosphere, you will hear from them again in just a little while.

16
00:04:18,266 --> 00:04:25,904
Right now, I'd like to invite up the Girls on the Run team from Roberts to lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance.

17
00:04:43,996 --> 00:04:54,499
United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

18
00:05:03,562 --> 00:05:06,943
And I might add, with liberty and swift justice for all.

19
00:05:08,564 --> 00:05:16,215
Thank you, it is now my pleasure to introduce Rabbi Jessica Delera of Temple Shalom to give the invocation.

20
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,540
We may be seated.

21
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,101
I feel like I'm at work.

22
00:05:59,046 --> 00:06:10,992
How many of us had some sort of essay contest or journal prompt when we were kids where they asked you, if you were president for a day, what would you do?

23
00:06:11,012 --> 00:06:13,253
I imagine that is familiar.

24
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:30,584
Now, one of the answers that I came up with when I was a child, because I was always that kid, was that if I were president for a day, I would pass a law that would ban paying athletes and movie stars more than we pay nurses and teachers.

25
00:06:37,093 --> 00:06:53,418
But this we see as an exercise for children, because those of us who work in actual leadership in the real world, in whatever capacities, from elected government to whatever our careers are, to our own homes, know that leadership is not that simple.

26
00:06:53,478 --> 00:06:57,960
You don't get to just say, this is how it's going to be, and then it is, and that's the end of the story.

27
00:06:59,304 --> 00:07:06,850
So in the Jewish tradition, we have just started in the Torah reading that we read the entire five books of Moses over the course of a year.

28
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:13,235
We've just started the book of Shemot, the book of Exodus, where Moses gets his call to leadership.

29
00:07:13,415 --> 00:07:15,356
God speaks to him from the burning bush.

30
00:07:16,577 --> 00:07:22,083
And he has the opportunity to be president, not just for a day, but forever.

31
00:07:22,203 --> 00:07:29,491
He gets to be the leader who leads the Israelites out of slavery, who embarks upon that project.

32
00:07:30,172 --> 00:07:31,193
And he doesn't want it.

33
00:07:32,134 --> 00:07:34,255
He wants first a partner.

34
00:07:34,355 --> 00:07:40,359
He wants his brother Aaron to help him with the public speaking portion of it, which he does not feel comfortable with.

35
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:56,528
And then he and Aaron go and they build a coalition of the Zikne Yisrael, the elders of the community of Israel, to build broader buy-in for what the idea they're trying to sell, which is that we should not be oppressed.

36
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:59,570
We are going to go to Pharaoh and tell him to let us go.

37
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:03,355
And no matter what it takes, we are going to make that goal happen.

38
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,804
And that is, I think, a model for all of us.

39
00:08:09,818 --> 00:08:10,038
Right?

40
00:08:10,298 --> 00:08:22,061
It may seem at first that you're supposed to do it alone, but really what you ought to be doing is looking for partners and building a coalition of the people that you are serving.

41
00:08:23,881 --> 00:08:38,185
There's a saying in Pirkei Avot, one of the oldest layers of the Talmud, that says, bimkom she'en anashim, hishtadel liyot ish, which I translate as, in a place where there is nobody,

42
00:08:39,065 --> 00:08:47,473
You must strive to be somebody, that we all have opportunities in our lives where we are needed to step up.

43
00:08:47,514 --> 00:08:54,080
We look around and we're thinking somebody should do something, and we have that moment of realizing, I am that somebody.

44
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:59,365
I need to step up and be the leader, be the person that's needed, make sure that it gets done.

45
00:09:00,495 --> 00:09:10,024
And that is tempered with this idea of altifrosch min hatzibo, which means do not separate yourself from the public, from the community.

46
00:09:11,285 --> 00:09:15,408
And this is a principle that I see happening here in Medford.

47
00:09:15,468 --> 00:09:19,992
I have the privilege of co-coaching with Mayor Brianna with Girls on the Run.

48
00:09:23,174 --> 00:09:46,526
It just fills me with such joy to see people who are engaged with the public, who are not separating themselves from the people that they were elected to represent in their various capacities, who have the needs and the purposes of the whole community before them at all times as they're making the tough decisions that are a necessary part of leadership.

49
00:09:48,311 --> 00:10:05,432
In Judaism, the person who is leading the service is called, whether it's a rabbi, a cantor, a layperson, is called a shaliach tzibor, the one who is sent by the public to represent the people of their community, not just in the room, but also between us and the divine.

50
00:10:06,676 --> 00:10:32,127
And so I ask now, there are many, many names of God, the one that rises to me today is Hamechin Mitzadeh-Gaver, may the one who guides the steps of humankind, guide the steps of these, our leaders here in Medford, granting them the wisdom to listen to the many voices of the people that they represent, and even and perhaps especially those who have been told that their voices don't count.

51
00:10:33,246 --> 00:10:41,295
and the courage to build the coalitions toward positive action that is going to put the needs of the whole community at the forefront always.

52
00:10:41,315 --> 00:10:42,957
Amen.

53
00:10:57,637 --> 00:11:00,919
Thank you, Rabbi, for those words of affirmation and faith.

54
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:15,649
And we would be remiss if we missed an opportunity to celebrate the nation with the singing of, excuse me, with the singing of the Sarsaparilla Banner.

55
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:17,430
So if Bessie

56
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:04,239
Two.

57
00:12:12,542 --> 00:12:38,127
O say can you see, by the dawn's early light, What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming, Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight,

58
00:12:38,947 --> 00:12:48,394
O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming?

59
00:12:48,474 --> 00:13:05,327
And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air, Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there.

60
00:13:06,081 --> 00:13:11,570
Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet

61
00:14:03,146 --> 00:14:18,919
So earlier last year, I had the pleasure of passing along the torch of the Poet Laureate ship, the first one in Medford, to my successor, who is a dear friend and a wonderful poet in her own right.

62
00:14:19,319 --> 00:14:28,707
So it's my honor to introduce Medford's Poet Laureate, Vijaya Sundaram, who will perform her poem, Message from the Rooted World.

63
00:14:55,697 --> 00:14:56,417
technology.

64
00:15:06,801 --> 00:15:08,582
Message from the rooted world.

65
00:15:11,235 --> 00:15:28,703
Insistent and interweaving, strong and sturdy roots not leaving room for doubt clutch at the earth, where mother trees in daylight birth their treelings which all grow together in the sun of gloomy weather.

66
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:41,976
Fungal filaments transmitting news that seems unplanned, unwitting, but in fact have all found root in storied forests, greening shoots.

67
00:15:42,757 --> 00:15:53,247
Take their songs of health and healing through the soil to trees appealing to their rooted sense and strength through all their breadth and all their length.

68
00:15:54,545 --> 00:16:06,852
And so do we, through all our stories, all our losses, all our glories, carry messages of sharing in our giving and our caring.

69
00:16:07,753 --> 00:16:12,976
Indifferences find common goals, our unique and united souls.

70
00:16:14,117 --> 00:16:19,680
And this, our rich community, with caring and humanity,

71
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:34,152
could grow a space that's free of strife, a shining city filled with life, salute the old, embrace the new, reject all wrongs, avow what's true.

72
00:16:35,450 --> 00:17:00,456
A forest humming richly green Is rooted in its place between This swaying bridge of birth and death It sings its song and gives us breath So too shall we in growing bands Conjoin our forces, join our hands In different voices, sing as one And branching, reach towards the sun

73
00:17:20,074 --> 00:17:23,755
I guess Ray Charles said it best, you got the right one, baby.

74
00:17:30,298 --> 00:17:34,219
Ladies and gentlemen, this woman needs no introduction.

75
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:44,043
She is a friend, she is a marvelous vocalist, and she wears a lot of other hats, but tonight she's going to perform for you, God bless America, Stacey Clayton.

76
00:17:53,186 --> 00:17:54,889
Please feel free to join me.

77
00:17:54,929 --> 00:17:57,835
This is a tough one to sit through and not sing.

78
00:17:57,975 --> 00:18:00,539
So help me sing with harmony.

79
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,202
If you want to stand, you can.

80
00:18:02,243 --> 00:18:04,286
You don't have to, but enjoy it.

81
00:18:06,144 --> 00:18:16,476
God bless America, land that I love.

82
00:18:17,056 --> 00:18:27,668
Stand beside her and guide her through the night with the light from above.

83
00:18:29,068 --> 00:18:42,393
From the mountains, to the prairies, to the oceans, white with foam.

84
00:18:42,893 --> 00:18:53,396
God bless America, my home sweet home.

85
00:18:56,135 --> 00:19:09,133
Oh God bless America, our home sweet home.

86
00:19:27,498 --> 00:19:33,220
And now I'd like to welcome another person who really needs no introduction.

87
00:19:34,241 --> 00:19:42,044
She is the director of the Medford Family Network, and she does such marvelous work all across the city.

88
00:19:42,544 --> 00:19:51,768
She's an advocate for parents, she's an advocate for children, she's an advocate for families, obviously, and she is going to present our community message.

89
00:19:52,188 --> 00:19:53,189
Marie Cassidy.

90
00:20:11,857 --> 00:20:12,978
Good evening, everybody.

91
00:20:13,098 --> 00:20:15,240
And thank you, Terry, for those beautiful words.

92
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,521
I'm thrilled to be here.

93
00:20:17,061 --> 00:20:18,983
So honored to be here this evening.

94
00:20:19,604 --> 00:20:25,148
Such a celebration, an inauguration, a new beginning for our new leadership team.

95
00:20:25,689 --> 00:20:31,374
May Brianna Lungo Kern, our new city council, our new school committee, congratulations to all of you.

96
00:20:32,435 --> 00:20:33,355
It's a new day.

97
00:20:34,076 --> 00:20:35,097
It's a new dawn.

98
00:20:35,637 --> 00:20:36,518
It's a new life.

99
00:20:37,139 --> 00:20:38,320
Shall we sing that together?

100
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:41,079
It's a new dawn.

101
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,000
It's a new day.

102
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,340
Stacy, help me out.

103
00:20:45,021 --> 00:20:46,241
It's a new life.

104
00:20:46,562 --> 00:20:47,462
And what are we feeling?

105
00:20:47,482 --> 00:20:49,983
And we're feeling good.

106
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:51,324
Da-dunce.

107
00:20:51,844 --> 00:20:52,545
Da-dunce.

108
00:20:52,965 --> 00:20:53,625
Da-dunce.

109
00:20:54,626 --> 00:20:56,127
Congratulations to everybody.

110
00:20:56,147 --> 00:20:57,287
It's absolutely fabulous.

111
00:20:58,008 --> 00:21:00,209
And we all should be feeling good tonight.

112
00:21:00,289 --> 00:21:01,610
Let's feel really, really good.

113
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:31,452
As a director of the Medford Family Network for the past 30 years, I say to you with incredible pride and humility that we, and I speak on behalf of my amazing, superb staff and amazing panel leaders, that the MFN, over the past 30 years, that we would not have prospered and thrived and been without the unwavering support of this community, of the Medford that we have, this incredible community.

114
00:21:32,473 --> 00:21:41,598
I'm a Medford girl from the start, and I hold deep passion and adoration for Medford, a keeper of my childhood dreams and my aspirations.

115
00:21:42,619 --> 00:21:58,288
I have been in a unique position to see and appreciate all that it has taken to really be essential for this community to exercise the power of discovering what it cares about.

116
00:21:59,409 --> 00:22:05,895
And never has that care been more evident than in March of 2020, does anyone remember that?

117
00:22:06,516 --> 00:22:09,999
March of 2020, when the world changed forever.

118
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:22,210
In spite of the devastation of body, spirit, and mind, this community saw the opportunity to provide unity.

119
00:22:22,771 --> 00:22:23,992
Terry, do you like that one?

120
00:22:26,147 --> 00:22:43,725
Businesses and organizations came together and presented the MFN with a check for $10,000 so we could reach out to our families and provide greatly needed concrete supports such as clothing, food, diapers, formula,

121
00:22:44,065 --> 00:22:57,334
financial assistance to pay bills and monthly rent, to repair cars, to fix broken windows, to purchase medications, to purchase household appliances, and help in any way that was needed.

122
00:22:57,874 --> 00:23:00,175
And that's because this community did this.

123
00:23:00,215 --> 00:23:03,377
You came together in ways that no one else could have done.

124
00:23:04,438 --> 00:23:30,918
I will name so many of you, the Tufts University, the wonderful school department that we work in, our police department, our fire department, City Hall, all of our great departments, Mayor, Office of Prevention Outreach, Department of Equity and Inclusion, the YMCA, the West Norfolk Community Center, public library, local unions, houses of worship, Chamber of Commerce, individual political leaders, other families, I could go on and on.

125
00:23:31,659 --> 00:23:33,901
It was amazing how all of you came together.

126
00:23:36,292 --> 00:23:47,677
In 1855, the eminent abolitionist Frederick Douglass said, it is easier to build strong children than to repair a broken man, or I'll add, woman.

127
00:23:48,812 --> 00:24:15,054
Understanding that, we are determined to succeed at our job to help build strong children across a broad spectrum of social issues, challenging circumstances, and personal concerns, as well as to be the source, this is what our job is, a source of the need to belong, the need to have meaning, the need to have fun, the need to be accepted, and the need to connect.

128
00:24:16,315 --> 00:24:27,402
In strengthening children and families, all families, and all those who define themselves as families, beloved to one another, we strengthen community.

129
00:24:28,382 --> 00:24:30,303
Now let's look at that word, community.

130
00:24:31,044 --> 00:24:32,465
There's a you in community.

131
00:24:33,525 --> 00:24:36,126
Actually, it's you in community.

132
00:24:37,046 --> 00:24:42,548
You are so important to the success of the Continually Build a Strong Foundation.

133
00:24:42,568 --> 00:24:48,989
And we're going to help this administration continually build on the strong foundation that they've already built.

134
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:50,210
That's up to you.

135
00:24:51,633 --> 00:24:54,895
certainly for this administration and those that have gone in the past.

136
00:24:55,615 --> 00:24:57,276
And there's an I in community.

137
00:24:57,296 --> 00:25:06,700
I. I had better do my part to hold you up, to lift you up, to help you see the best in you.

138
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,581
And there's a why in community.

139
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:11,882
There's a why right at the very end.

140
00:25:12,702 --> 00:25:17,965
It's at the end, but in the end, it's all about you and I.

141
00:25:19,116 --> 00:25:21,079
So here's a challenge for you and I right now.

142
00:25:21,099 --> 00:25:25,125
We're on the cusp of a new legacy with a new administration.

143
00:25:25,886 --> 00:25:30,253
We may not all agree what that legacy is, but I've got a few suggestions.

144
00:25:31,491 --> 00:25:33,573
Number one, listen to each other.

145
00:25:34,414 --> 00:25:35,334
Truly listen.

146
00:25:36,235 --> 00:25:36,295
Why?

147
00:25:36,976 --> 00:25:38,537
So you will be heard.

148
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:40,719
Give back to each other.

149
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:41,560
Why?

150
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:48,466
Because in not totally agreeing, we get something that makes us dig a little deeper into ourselves.

151
00:25:49,106 --> 00:25:53,590
Maybe offer us a new perspective, a new freshness, a new vitality.

152
00:25:54,791 --> 00:26:01,614
Step up, step around, and then step back and maybe even step aside.

153
00:26:02,534 --> 00:26:05,495
Make room for others with dignity and respect.

154
00:26:06,695 --> 00:26:10,457
Be present by looking toward the future while looking behind.

155
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:11,657
Why?

156
00:26:12,297 --> 00:26:13,758
Because it's all we have.

157
00:26:14,658 --> 00:26:18,740
It's a new dawn, it's a new day, it's a new life.

158
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,520
It is beautiful.

159
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,261
Treasure it.

160
00:26:22,341 --> 00:26:23,561
It is all we have.

161
00:26:24,561 --> 00:26:39,924
Because of you, my community of Medford, our full and resource-rich community, our children and our families will always have a friend to know and a place to grow, and we'll never have to walk alone.

162
00:26:40,525 --> 00:26:41,005
Thank you.

163
00:26:41,325 --> 00:26:42,345
Congratulations!

164
00:27:03,427 --> 00:27:06,810
Vijay, we'll make poets out of them before it's over.

165
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:07,991
Every one of them.

166
00:27:09,792 --> 00:27:13,275
Thank you, Marie, for those inspirational words.

167
00:27:14,055 --> 00:27:21,401
And now we'll have remarks from the State Representative of the 34th Middlesex District, Ms.

168
00:27:21,441 --> 00:27:22,322
Christine Barber.

169
00:27:31,923 --> 00:27:32,864
Good evening, everyone.

170
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:35,347
Thank you so much to Marie Cassidy.

171
00:27:35,567 --> 00:27:38,470
I want to actually, can we have another round for Marie?

172
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,772
She is one of the true heroes of Medford.

173
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:42,234
Really honored to work with her.

174
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:55,296
I'm State Representative Christine Barber of 34th Middlesex District, honored to represent neighborhoods in Medford, including Hillside and South Medford.

175
00:27:55,857 --> 00:28:04,883
I'm delighted and honored to be with you all here tonight as we celebrate the inauguration of the school committee members and new city councilors.

176
00:28:05,944 --> 00:28:09,627
I'd like to congratulate all of you on who are being sworn in this evening.

177
00:28:10,207 --> 00:28:13,790
And I'm looking forward to our partnership as we continue to work together in 2024.

178
00:28:15,899 --> 00:28:17,762
So I want to welcome everyone who's joined us tonight.

179
00:28:17,942 --> 00:28:26,313
I know we're joined by the other members of the state delegation, including State Representative Donato, State Representative Garbally, and State Senator Pat Jalen.

180
00:28:35,336 --> 00:28:40,780
I'd also like to welcome the family members and the loved ones of those who are being sworn in tonight.

181
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:47,804
I know how much you support those who are elected and will continue to support them and really appreciate your presence here.

182
00:28:49,125 --> 00:28:56,130
And most importantly, I want to thank and welcome all the members of the Medford community who have joined us here in person or who are watching online.

183
00:28:57,694 --> 00:29:02,058
So I'm honored tonight to introduce Mayor Brianna Lungo-Kern.

184
00:29:03,099 --> 00:29:05,380
Mayor Lungo-Kern is a lifelong Medford resident.

185
00:29:05,481 --> 00:29:09,644
She was first sworn into office as the 32nd Mayor of Medford in January of 2020.

186
00:29:11,314 --> 00:29:24,740
So we know in her first term, the mayor tackled the huge challenges of addressing the COVID-19 epidemic, making sure residents and employees were safe, had access to food and housing amid that pandemic.

187
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,982
She's ensured city programs continue to support the needs of all of our residents.

188
00:29:30,054 --> 00:29:38,118
Since then, she's been able to launch Medford's first multi-year comprehensive plan to create a 30-year vision for our community.

189
00:29:38,899 --> 00:29:44,722
She's created the city's first housing plan and funded needed street and sidewalk repairs throughout the city.

190
00:29:46,013 --> 00:29:54,202
Over the past three plus years, I've had the honor of partnering with the mayor, with the rest of the state delegation, as we have funded a number of projects throughout the city.

191
00:29:55,003 --> 00:30:01,129
So recently we just secured funding for the city's first universally accessible playground at the Midland Middle School.

192
00:30:02,591 --> 00:30:09,822
We had the ribbon-cutting for the Clippership Connector, which is a major multi-use path along the Mystic River connecting our communities.

193
00:30:10,543 --> 00:30:17,514
We've also been able to get some municipal grants for climate change to preserve climate resiliency in Medford.

194
00:30:19,349 --> 00:30:31,460
And most recently, we took a huge leap forward with Medford's high school, where the school building authority voted to allow Medford to go to the next step in attaining funding for that.

195
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:40,428
And that was a partnership with the mayor, the school administration, the school committee, and a great example of what we can do when we all work together, we can move things.

196
00:30:44,231 --> 00:30:44,652
It's good, yes.

197
00:30:49,443 --> 00:30:50,524
Definitely clap for that.

198
00:30:50,584 --> 00:30:53,965
That is a big one and there are a lot more big things before us in Medford.

199
00:30:54,626 --> 00:31:01,249
So on top of all the Mayor's good work in Medford, she has really prioritized programs that support young people, especially girls.

200
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:07,232
And it seems fitting for someone who first ran for and won her City Council seat at age 21.

201
00:31:08,593 --> 00:31:19,460
The mayor continues to be involved with such programs as Girls on the Run, who did the Pledge of Allegiance here today, and continues to build support and build confidence for the next generation here in Medford.

202
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:25,063
So I look forward to working with the mayor and everyone in the city as we continue our partnership going forward.

203
00:31:25,723 --> 00:31:34,929
So with that, I am honored to introduce Mayor Lungo Kern and her daughter Bailey, who is going to be administering the oath of office for her this evening.

204
00:32:00,677 --> 00:32:03,620
Bailey was a little under the weather, so this is my daughter Callaway.

205
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:15,951
I, state your name.

206
00:32:16,612 --> 00:32:21,637
I, Brianna Lungo Kern.

207
00:32:22,133 --> 00:32:51,490
do solemnly affirm, do solemnly affirm, that I will faithfully and impartially, that I will faithfully and impartially, discharge and perform, discharge and perform, all the duties incumbent upon me, all the duties incumbent upon me, as Mayor of the City of Medford, as Mayor of the City of Medford, according to the best of my ability, according to the best of my ability, and understanding, and understanding, agreeable to the rules and regulations of the Constitution,

208
00:32:52,051 --> 00:32:54,333
agreeable to the rules and regulations of the Constitution.

209
00:32:54,773 --> 00:32:56,695
The laws of the Commonwealth.

210
00:32:56,715 --> 00:32:57,696
The laws of the Commonwealth.

211
00:32:58,116 --> 00:33:00,118
And the ordinance of the city of Medford.

212
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:01,899
And the ordinances of the city of Medford.

213
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:06,143
Thank you.

214
00:33:06,163 --> 00:33:06,623
Thank you.

215
00:33:06,643 --> 00:33:07,384
You want to sit?

216
00:33:07,544 --> 00:33:07,664
Yeah.

217
00:33:24,565 --> 00:33:25,605
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

218
00:33:29,127 --> 00:33:29,607
Thank you.

219
00:33:31,367 --> 00:33:31,848
Thank you, Rep.

220
00:33:31,868 --> 00:33:34,448
Barber, for that introduction and your kind words.

221
00:33:35,129 --> 00:33:39,050
Good evening, and thank you all for coming to the 2024 Medford Inauguration.

222
00:33:40,231 --> 00:33:42,851
Thank you to everyone who is taking part in today's ceremony.

223
00:33:43,892 --> 00:33:52,015
Thank you to Director of Community Affairs, Lisa Coliani, who did all the planning for this wonderful event, and Director of Communications, Steve Smearty,

224
00:33:59,548 --> 00:34:01,509
for helping me work on this very long speech.

225
00:34:02,829 --> 00:34:06,071
I took out all the dad jokes, though, that you put in.

226
00:34:07,111 --> 00:34:21,598
I also want to take the opportunity to recognize the tireless work of our department heads, city staff, my fellow elected officials, and volunteers who have continued to do amazing things while navigating all of the challenges we have faced over the last four years.

227
00:34:22,867 --> 00:34:28,492
As I've always said, the successes of this administration are not due to a single policy or person.

228
00:34:29,373 --> 00:34:35,959
They're a contribution of ideas from some of the brightest and most dedicated people I've had the pleasure of working with.

229
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:43,866
So to everyone who works in this building and for the city as a whole, thank you for your hard work to make Medford such a special place.

230
00:34:45,134 --> 00:34:48,517
I'd also like to thank my family for supporting me while I continue this work.

231
00:34:49,197 --> 00:34:58,044
Dave, Bailey, Calloway, Cody, Mom and Dad, I appreciate your patience, sacrifice, strength and love, no matter how hard it gets for us sometimes.

232
00:34:59,285 --> 00:35:03,348
With each new term brings a renewed sense of service and commitment to our city.

233
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:12,015
All of us here standing before you, about to accept the immense responsibility you have bestowed, are filled with gratitude and humility.

234
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:17,112
I can safely say that taking this oath is one of the greatest privileges of my life.

235
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:23,834
And though I've been extraordinarily fortunate to be trusted with this honor several times, I never take it for granted.

236
00:35:25,035 --> 00:35:32,477
That's a message I hope my fellow colleagues experiencing this again, or for the first time, take to heart.

237
00:35:33,536 --> 00:35:44,059
Enjoy this day, cherish the road that brought you to this point, and never lose sight of the ultimate goal, serving the people of this city with pride, purpose, and professionalism.

238
00:35:44,939 --> 00:35:46,300
Congratulations to you all.

239
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:57,923
We are at the forefront of the future of Medford, and I'm excited to work with you all and continue the relationships with those re-elected, Jenny, Paul, Melanie, Zach, Kit, Justin, and George.

240
00:35:59,181 --> 00:36:06,665
and forge new partnerships with those serving for the first time, Erica, Aaron, Nicole, Anna, Emily, and Matt.

241
00:36:07,845 --> 00:36:19,211
Over the past two terms, we have taken so many steps forward in creating a vibrant, equitable, accountable, and forward-thinking city from our hiring practices to everyday decisions we make.

242
00:36:20,092 --> 00:36:28,156
We have done the hard work, faced many obstacles, and now look to keep moving forward and continue to build on the foundation we have created.

243
00:36:30,114 --> 00:36:41,903
For years, it has been said that Medford has lagged behind other surrounding cities in terms of maximizing its development potential, increasing our commercial tax base, leveraging city-owned assets, and investing in its infrastructure.

244
00:36:42,644 --> 00:36:55,314
I shared in those concerns and criticisms while on the Council and made it a priority as Mayor to redirect our development strategy to focus on growth that contributes both to the bottom line as well as addresses key needs in our community.

245
00:36:56,198 --> 00:37:00,359
None perhaps more critical to our future than creating more affordable housing options.

246
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:12,822
To help make that possible, my office, along with the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability, led by Director Hunt, Alicia Hunt, worked closely with the City Council to establish an affordable housing trust.

247
00:37:13,822 --> 00:37:19,423
The trust will use various funding streams to help facilitate more affordable units coming to market.

248
00:37:20,124 --> 00:37:25,705
I thank the Council for being a strong partner in that process and look forward to working with the new members

249
00:37:26,141 --> 00:37:27,462
to expand on its potential.

250
00:37:28,903 --> 00:37:38,250
Much of this progress is also thanks to the advocacy and work of the former council that passed a much-needed recodification of the city's zoning ordinances in 2022.

251
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:41,232
Through this recodification process,

252
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:57,783
My administration worked with the City Council to establish a new zoning district, called the Planned Development District, which encourages proposals that specify a mixture of commercial, industrial, residential, open space, or other uses, as well as a DIF district for Medford Square.

253
00:37:57,803 --> 00:38:04,264
To help manage our lofty and complex development and zoning goals, it's critical that we have a top-tier team in place.

254
00:38:05,764 --> 00:38:08,545
That's why I'm grateful for the work that Bill 40 has done

255
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:16,025
during his tenure as building commissioner, and thank him for staying on in an interim role as we searched for our successor.

256
00:38:17,165 --> 00:38:20,388
Our new commissioner starts in a few weeks, which is exciting.

257
00:38:20,968 --> 00:38:24,631
But Bill, please know, you have been instrumental in furthering our work here.

258
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:40,718
And by doing this work together, we are seizing on the opportunity to bring real, transformative change to the city.

259
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:46,982
We are in the process of bringing over 500 new residential units to the community through eight residential developments.

260
00:38:47,842 --> 00:39:02,050
To further support the housing crisis that is affecting nearly every municipality, we have also allocated $400,000 in ARPA funds to help offset permitting costs of renovations and upgrades to the current and new affordable housing units at the Medford Housing Authority.

261
00:39:03,066 --> 00:39:06,909
The guiding force behind our housing development strategy is the Housing Production Plan.

262
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:17,679
This document serves as our roadmap to more meaningful community experience for our residents, and has been crafted with insight from housing advocates, local leaders, and the City Council.

263
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:24,245
I thank everyone involved who has lent their time, resources, and knowledge to help address this evolving and complex crisis.

264
00:39:25,598 --> 00:39:35,402
In addition to increasing the housing stock, we are also working to bring new innovative industries to Medford that can tap into the talent pool and transform neighborhoods into technology hubs for the region.

265
00:39:36,162 --> 00:39:39,064
There are currently four life science development projects underway.

266
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,024
And this is just the beginning.

267
00:39:41,565 --> 00:39:47,407
To truly activate the economic engine of Medford, we must continue to support and invest in our squares and green spaces.

268
00:39:48,167 --> 00:39:54,190
The next two years will bring about significant change to Medford Square, the central hub of our downtown commercial district.

269
00:39:55,097 --> 00:40:02,163
With three undeveloped lots located in the heart of the square, we are continuing that work that is stretched back to 2010.

270
00:40:03,344 --> 00:40:16,415
Armed with significant input from our residents, our past economic development director, Victor Schrader, and moving forward with the help of our newly hired economic development director, Sal DiStefano, we are finalizing an RFP to be released soon.

271
00:40:17,352 --> 00:40:28,123
With that portion of the square poised for transformation, it's wonderful to see Salem, Forest, and High Street becoming a nighttime destination for families and the public at large.

272
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:38,153
Seeing the square bustling during the evening thanks to Chevalier Theatre and our amazing restaurants, with more to open in 2024, brings such a great smile to my face.

273
00:40:39,161 --> 00:40:42,243
That type of draw and that level of interest does not happen overnight.

274
00:40:42,804 --> 00:40:53,211
It takes commitment, dedication, and strong partnership between city staff, private partners, the council, and our Chamber of Commerce, now led by the new President Rocco DiRico.

275
00:40:54,132 --> 00:40:59,495
Together, we've been able to help strengthen our local businesses in many ways and support their journey through the pandemic.

276
00:41:00,216 --> 00:41:08,442
Last year, we awarded many of our local businesses a total of over $100,000 through the Small Business Facade Improvement Grant Program.

277
00:41:09,784 --> 00:41:17,772
Also, with so many people eager to frequent our commercial corridors, it only makes sense to fully activate our waterfront property.

278
00:41:25,273 --> 00:41:30,038
which we have plans for, and make green spaces in our squares more accessible and pedestrian-friendly.

279
00:41:30,678 --> 00:41:37,045
We have officially broken ground on the Clippership Connector, uniting a pedestrian pathway between Riverbend Park and Clippership Park.

280
00:41:37,846 --> 00:41:45,113
The path will allow people to walk, run, bike, and push strolls along a section of the river that to date has been blocked from public access.

281
00:41:45,914 --> 00:41:48,937
I thank Mayor Burke, City staff, and our partners at DCR

282
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:55,339
especially new Commissioner Brian Arrigo for helping get that process off the ground and now in construction.

283
00:41:56,820 --> 00:42:04,123
We are also sitting on a truly transformative and generational opportunity with 28 acres of air rights above the Wellington MBTA station.

284
00:42:04,883 --> 00:42:15,147
For decades, this city-owned area went undeveloped and we are now in a position to activate that area and transform it into a mixed-use, transit-oriented residential and commercial destination.

285
00:42:16,431 --> 00:42:26,453
We received proposals on what could be feasible for the space and are now in the process of releasing an RFP to hire a consultant to help us move forward in the next stage of the development process.

286
00:42:27,673 --> 00:42:36,035
There are significant development projects that will have a substantial impact on not only the landscape of our community, but our projected revenues as well.

287
00:42:36,896 --> 00:42:43,377
And while that is a profound positive for our city, it is not the highlight of our future project prospects.

288
00:42:45,387 --> 00:42:51,149
That distinction squarely falls on the amazing news of our Mass School Building Authority application.

289
00:42:52,229 --> 00:42:59,531
It was recently announced that we have secured a spot in this year's process and we're on the path to reimagining a new state-of-the-art high school.

290
00:43:00,671 --> 00:43:14,655
I'm thrilled that through the work of Superintendent Maurice-Edward Vincent, our school committee, school district staff, community partners, and our team at City Hall, we now have the opportunity to collaborate with the state to make this project a reality for our community.

291
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:23,497
This would not be possible without the advocacy and support from so many advocates, as well as the City Council who approved moving forward with the application.

292
00:43:25,165 --> 00:43:31,051
The only project that may rival the high school in terms of size and scope is that we're also doing our fire headquarters over.

293
00:43:31,752 --> 00:43:35,736
Our firefighters need a facility that meets the needs of a 21st century department.

294
00:43:36,337 --> 00:43:39,260
Last year, we hired the Gallant Architecture Studio, Inc.

295
00:43:39,701 --> 00:43:45,687
to design and envision a new fire department headquarters, and we are about to begin the design phase of a $25 to $30 million facility.

296
00:43:48,342 --> 00:44:01,946
In addition, there has been nearly $4 million put towards our fire department projects that are complete or near completion at our substations, and $2 million going towards two fire pump trucks that have recently been ordered to upgrade the fleet we currently have.

297
00:44:03,167 --> 00:44:10,589
We have also solicited a reviewing proposal for architects to assist with designing much-needed additional upgrades and renovations to our stations.

298
00:44:11,718 --> 00:44:15,803
These needs were on the top of my list when I ran in 2019.

299
00:44:16,323 --> 00:44:23,352
And I thank Chief of Staff Nina Nazarian and Chief John Friedman for helping us make it all a reality for the department.

300
00:44:24,966 --> 00:44:42,490
In addition to all the work being done to our fire stations and high school, we're also now, through the hard work of Paul Riggi, the city's first ever facilities maintenance director, reviewing, planning, and investing in our facilities by taking important steps to ensure their longevity and usefulness.

301
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:52,512
We're also making significant progress in all things IT related, thanks initially to Jim Silva and our IT director, Rich Lane.

302
00:44:53,512 --> 00:44:54,612
Our IT infrastructure,

303
00:45:01,667 --> 00:45:03,768
IT's not fancy, but it's pretty important.

304
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:16,699
Our City IT infrastructure is getting an overhaul with the buildings getting connected with fiber optics and important changes to the network inside City Hall to make our system more reliable and support the needs of our departments.

305
00:45:18,601 --> 00:45:27,209
In addition to the work being done in city facilities, we are also forging ahead with millions invested towards incredible upgrades and renovations to our parks and open spaces.

306
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:47,296
Thanks to the hard work of staff planner Amanda Centrella, along with our entire parks team, which includes rec director Kevin Bailey, tree warden Aggie Tooden, our chief procurement officer Fiona Maxwell, and our DPW crew, this past year alone, a number of additional projects have either been completed or celebrated with a groundbreaking.

307
00:45:48,037 --> 00:45:54,082
Including just this week, we upgraded, we did a groundbreaking for the accessible McGlynn Playground.

308
00:45:55,177 --> 00:46:03,385
Many parks and recreation spaces have also been upgraded with new art murals, including our latest reveal by artist Jamie Chan at Wrights Pond.

309
00:46:04,667 --> 00:46:10,833
Our most ambitious park project, a major renovation undertaking at Carr Park Broke Ground this past fall.

310
00:46:11,684 --> 00:46:32,413
The car park renovation project is split into two phases, and the second phase, which is going to have all seasons basketball court, thanks to Congresswoman Kathleen Clark, who secured us a $1.5 million federal earmark for that phase.

311
00:46:34,213 --> 00:46:39,816
Investing in our parks and open spaces is a critical part of our effort to combat and reduce the effects of climate change.

312
00:46:40,751 --> 00:46:47,705
Making our parks more sustainable, accessible and resilient is just one facet of our strategy to reduce emissions.

313
00:46:48,732 --> 00:46:52,054
We are also taking the same approach to the City's infrastructure and operations.

314
00:46:52,775 --> 00:47:05,723
Medford's work with the Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness continues as the City was granted over $400,000 from the State in December to expand climate resiliency efforts and $500,000 more recently in grant money from the Barr Foundation.

315
00:47:06,604 --> 00:47:12,608
With this funding, the City is enhancing its climate resiliency and emergency preparedness efforts through Medford Connects.

316
00:47:13,496 --> 00:47:32,280
Medford Connects, headed by our Board of Health Director, Marian O'Connor, and the Office of Prevention and Outreach Director, Penny Fanioli, will seek to expand and strengthen resources for community members who are most marginalized to build the community's ability to withstand and recover from climate crises in the future.

317
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:42,482
The Green Communities Division awarded Medford $100,000 to make Gulcani Ice Rink and the Department of Public Works more energy efficient and further reduce the city's carbon emissions.

318
00:47:43,621 --> 00:47:51,748
As a designated green community, we have committed to reducing municipal energy use by 20 percent from our baseline year, a goal we have in our sights.

319
00:47:53,450 --> 00:47:56,072
The City is also committed to expanding its tree canopy.

320
00:47:56,732 --> 00:48:03,258
We set a goal to plant over 200 trees throughout the community during the 2023 season as part of this continual strategy.

321
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:07,462
That number builds upon the 180 trees that were planted the year before.

322
00:48:08,450 --> 00:48:20,739
Using Community Preservation Act funds and ARPA funding, the goal is to plant trees in greater numbers of species and varieties in locations where they can grow and thrive into maturity so they can have an impact and provide benefits to the greater community.

323
00:48:21,939 --> 00:48:28,064
We're also heavily invested in removing tree stumps and repairing sidewalks damaged by the backlog of untreated stumps.

324
00:48:29,955 --> 00:48:44,387
As a start, this past year, we removed almost half on the list by investing almost a half million dollars to the tree stump removal process alone, through CDBG, ARPA, and state earmarks advocated for by our state delegation and in partnership with the city council.

325
00:48:45,227 --> 00:48:45,768
Thank you, Rep.

326
00:48:45,788 --> 00:48:53,874
Barber, Representative Donato, Representative Garbally, and Senator Jalen, for all the earmarks you got us, including on the stumps.

327
00:48:54,835 --> 00:48:57,597
And thank you to our CPA coordinator, Theresa DuPont,

328
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:05,927
CPA committee led by Roberta Cameron and our CDBG coordinator Laurel Siegel for making this and so many more projects a reality for Medford.

329
00:49:06,927 --> 00:49:15,915
To aid in our climate goals, the city is in the process of transitioning its parking fleet and police department cruiser fleet to fuel-efficient, climate-friendly hybrid options.

330
00:49:16,704 --> 00:49:27,992
Just a few weeks ago, the Police Department took delivery of six hybrid vehicles that will be utilized by officers in the field, and the Parking Department took delivery, before that, of three hybrid vehicles.

331
00:49:28,853 --> 00:49:37,820
I thank the Police Chief Jack Buckley and Parking Director Faye Morrison for their support and patience in making sure we all transition to a more fuel-efficient way of doing business.

332
00:49:39,295 --> 00:49:49,603
The City also secured a $230,000 Diesel Emissions Reduction Act grant from the State to assist with the purchasing of an all-electric commercial-grade street sweeper that we just took delivery on.

333
00:49:51,084 --> 00:50:00,871
While we've made those strides on the City side, thanks to Traffic and Transportation Director Todd Blake, we've also benefited from a public-private partnership with Lyft and Blue Bikes.

334
00:50:02,216 --> 00:50:11,063
About three weeks ago, we completed installation on two new stations, one in West Medford and another at Logan Park, bringing the network to 10, with more coming in the spring.

335
00:50:11,964 --> 00:50:16,948
Our EV charging station count has also gone up from 2 to 10 over the last four years.

336
00:50:18,309 --> 00:50:23,013
Over the last term, we also cut the ribbon on the Tufts-Medford branch of the Green Line Extension.

337
00:50:25,461 --> 00:50:33,123
Reducing our reliance on gas-powered vehicles and investing in green transportation options will only make our community more sustainable, equitable and accessible.

338
00:50:33,583 --> 00:50:38,084
But, of course, we cannot forgo our responsibility in fixing our roads and sidewalks.

339
00:50:38,624 --> 00:50:51,187
That's why this year alone we've made significant progress in extending the life of our streets through preventative maintenance and leveraging private partnerships to repair portions of major arteries like Winthrop Street, Pinkert, Haines Square and Riverside Ave.

340
00:50:52,113 --> 00:50:57,195
In the fall, we began an extensive patchwork program on 34 streets identified in the pavement assessment.

341
00:51:00,036 --> 00:51:07,600
Also, over the last year, we crack-sealed 94 streets, which extends their use and improves navigability and drainage on those streets.

342
00:51:08,715 --> 00:51:13,576
To coincide with our patchwork strategy, we also invested nearly $3 million in repairs to our sidewalks.

343
00:51:13,596 --> 00:51:27,519
About one-third of the total sidewalk funding, roughly $800,000, was used to address sidewalk issues logged by constituents in our C-Click Fix platform that also coincide with sidewalk locations identified in the 2021 sidewalk assessment.

344
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:40,587
Thanks to the incredible work of our DPW Commissioner Tim McGivern, City Engineer Owen Wartella and their staffs, we have repaired nearly two miles worth of sidewalks this past season.

345
00:51:41,287 --> 00:51:47,572
We're continuing this work into the next year thanks to the $1.5 million bond that the City Council approved at the beginning of last year.

346
00:51:48,432 --> 00:51:52,595
We'll deploy the rest of the funding to address sidewalks and curb cuts on Salem Street and beyond.

347
00:51:53,956 --> 00:52:08,182
Leadership within the City Council, School Committee, and City have also been and will continue to meet to figure out our projected assessment, budgeting, and borrowing needs for sidewalks, our major building improvements, and more.

348
00:52:09,103 --> 00:52:16,726
Thanks to the support of our Finance Director and Auditor Bob Dickinson, our Treasurer-Collector Judy Johnson, Assessor Ted Costigan,

349
00:52:17,782 --> 00:52:19,425
and our budget director, Courtney Cadello.

350
00:52:20,046 --> 00:52:29,403
We have come a long way in our new growth projections, how the city borrows and budgets, and we'll continue to work together with the council to enhance that process.

351
00:52:31,894 --> 00:52:35,777
And everything we do in Medford is informed through the lens of diversity, equity, and inclusion.

352
00:52:36,337 --> 00:52:46,243
With the help of our director, Frances Wojcicki, we are working towards ensuring that services, programs, and events are not only accessible, but share in the values and meet the needs of our diverse community.

353
00:52:47,124 --> 00:52:57,531
For the past two years, Frances and her work with stakeholders has strengthened relationships with community members and created lasting partnerships that have yielded meaningful experience for everyone.

354
00:52:58,371 --> 00:53:21,542
Whether it be reaffirming the City's commitment to human rights, championing accessible language options for visitors to City Hall, or building on the success of our first-ever Pride Month series events in 2022 with the help of our Pride Planning Committee, the City's desire to be an inclusive and welcoming place for all would not be possible without the work of our DEI office and department heads who support these goals.

355
00:53:22,903 --> 00:53:25,804
Our DEI endeavors, however, are not siloed to one office.

356
00:53:26,496 --> 00:53:29,738
they reach across departments, programs, and communications.

357
00:53:30,639 --> 00:53:49,090
The interdepartmental cohesion is best exemplified by the work being done through our human resource department, led by our director, Lisa Crowley, who, along with Francis, works diligently to ensure our hiring practices are based on best practices and that our workforce is more representative of our community.

358
00:53:49,851 --> 00:53:54,434
That's why we've been focused on training our staff and diversifying our staffing.

359
00:53:55,214 --> 00:53:58,239
We have made progress, but my commitment is to keep pushing to do better.

360
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:04,289
We need our staffing to represent the community we live in, and I promise to continue this work no matter what it takes.

361
00:54:05,831 --> 00:54:07,174
An important part of this project...

362
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:16,592
was the hiring of our Medford Connectors and liaisons who serve communities across the city and are fluent in four environmental justice languages.

363
00:54:17,312 --> 00:54:24,315
They have been working to listen and support Medford's diverse communities and help us improve communication policies and programs.

364
00:54:25,256 --> 00:54:27,477
We are committed to making Medford safe, welcoming,

365
00:54:28,570 --> 00:54:33,773
and are always looking to improve communication efforts and policies to continue to make that a reality.

366
00:54:34,714 --> 00:54:40,138
Through this initiative, we have been able to offer expanded translation services through a variety of communication methods.

367
00:54:40,798 --> 00:54:43,700
Of course, our multilingual resource line is always available.

368
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:57,149
We are also working to ensure that important information on our website and sent through the City Alert System and other avenues is translated into our five major languages, main languages.

369
00:54:57,869 --> 00:55:05,273
This is a first for the City and will allow us to message important City-related information to populations that were previously underserved in this area.

370
00:55:06,194 --> 00:55:22,102
The Office of Prevention and Outreach, with the help of these teams, is also working to strengthen resources available to community members who have been affected by the opioid crisis with an over 830,000 settlement from the Opioid Settlement Fund, with the potential for more funding in the future.

371
00:55:22,942 --> 00:55:24,143
Using interview surveys

372
00:55:24,687 --> 00:55:30,012
and other community outreach, the team is currently working through recommendations and strategies for investing these funds.

373
00:55:31,113 --> 00:55:41,282
I'm also happy to announce, as of last week, we hired our new Veterans Director, Veronica Shaw, who will continue the hard work of Jeremy Johns servicing our veterans and their needs.

374
00:55:42,042 --> 00:55:44,104
Thank you for joining our team, Veronica.

375
00:55:44,764 --> 00:56:02,098
You're a great addition to the staff we have here at City Hall and beyond, such as Pam Kelly, who runs our Senior Center and our Tax Workoff Program, Director Barbara Kerr, who operates our new Medford Public Library, Kevin Harrington, who helped video this tonight, who runs our Medford Community Media, and so many others.

376
00:56:03,639 --> 00:56:07,783
For those of you worried that the speech will be wrapping up soon, I'm almost halfway through.

377
00:56:11,704 --> 00:56:14,386
It's very hard to try to get every department in there.

378
00:56:14,446 --> 00:56:15,367
I can't not do it.

379
00:56:15,407 --> 00:56:15,908
I'm sorry.

380
00:56:17,129 --> 00:56:17,589
Just kidding.

381
00:56:17,609 --> 00:56:19,551
A few brief highlights and we're done.

382
00:56:20,291 --> 00:56:28,298
Just today, thanks to Clerk Adam Hurtubise, we were able to swear in and promote two firefighters in the department.

383
00:56:28,839 --> 00:56:31,921
And just last week, we welcomed six new police officers.

384
00:56:32,682 --> 00:56:46,629
The highlight of our police hires last week is that, once again, we were able to hire a diverse group that represents our community, which was not only a goal of Chief Buckley and I's, but something we are proud of to actually see become a reality.

385
00:56:48,230 --> 00:56:53,593
Run Medford, hopefully we'll be back for our third year in 2024, thanks to Dave McGilvery and Dempsey Sports.

386
00:56:54,611 --> 00:57:04,054
Our Charter Study Committee is deep into their work, gathering input, researching and holding community meetings on how to best shape our charter and how to move this city forward into the future.

387
00:57:05,215 --> 00:57:08,236
Thanks to our election manager, Melissa Ripley, and crew.

388
00:57:09,096 --> 00:57:09,696
Thank you to them.

389
00:57:09,736 --> 00:57:13,898
They're getting ready for the smooth presidential primary and election season this year.

390
00:57:14,755 --> 00:57:25,041
Thank you to our parking team for working on two phases of meter installs to make sure our squares have upgraded equipment, the remainder of which are going live, I believe, this month.

391
00:57:25,841 --> 00:57:32,285
Thank you to our police department, who are now equipped with body cameras for their safety, the safety of others, and for accountability purposes.

392
00:57:33,225 --> 00:57:36,567
There's so much more, but I've had enough, and I know you all have.

393
00:57:36,667 --> 00:57:38,688
We want to listen to Stacey in the Corral, I know.

394
00:57:41,334 --> 00:57:52,304
To conclude, I'm often asked what some of my most notable achievements during my time as mayor are, and I always say that no achievement is earned by one person, or in many cases, by one department.

395
00:57:52,905 --> 00:57:57,309
Every positive piece of progress that happens here is the result of the team we have here in the city.

396
00:57:57,889 --> 00:58:03,094
So thank you again for all your hard work, and in advance for your hard work coming in the next two years.

397
00:58:04,335 --> 00:58:08,604
I would also be remiss if I did not give a special thanks to my assistant, Daria Tajera.

398
00:58:09,045 --> 00:58:11,329
Her patience and kindness is felt by all.

399
00:58:12,131 --> 00:58:14,075
And she has dealt with me for eight years.

400
00:58:14,997 --> 00:58:15,298
Bless you.

401
00:58:17,731 --> 00:58:23,296
I am so excited for what the next two years will bring and thank you for entrusting me to lead our city for another term.

402
00:58:23,716 --> 00:58:29,201
I am dedicated to keeping the promises I've made to you and delivering on this vision for a better future for Medford.

403
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:34,885
And I know City Hall staff and my fellow elected officials are ready to do the work necessary to make that happen.

404
00:58:35,586 --> 00:58:43,272
No matter what challenges we face, we have proven that we are able to unite as a community and as a result are ready to take the next step into the future.

405
00:58:44,033 --> 00:58:51,970
We're at the forefront of a more sustainable, equitable, and prosperous time for Medford, and I can't wait to share that experience with you.

406
00:58:52,270 --> 00:58:52,531
Thank you.

407
00:59:24,816 --> 00:59:32,220
The whole time the mayor is speaking, I'm thinking of scuba, which is self-contained underwater breathing apparatus.

408
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:34,861
She obviously doesn't need a tank.

409
00:59:37,583 --> 00:59:39,804
Wonderful mayor, wonderful words.

410
00:59:41,425 --> 00:59:47,348
And now to administer the oath of office to the new City Council, Adam Herterby, City Clerk.

411
01:00:04,770 --> 01:00:05,811
If you could all stand, please.

412
01:00:07,772 --> 01:00:08,492
Raise your right hand.

413
01:00:08,772 --> 01:00:09,692
Repeat after me, please.

414
01:00:13,194 --> 01:00:15,215
Not everybody, just, sorry.

415
01:00:18,377 --> 01:00:20,238
You're going to repeat after me using your names.

416
01:00:21,058 --> 01:00:30,243
I do solemnly affirm that I will faithfully and impartially discharge and perform

417
01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:50,428
all the duties incumbent upon me as a member of the Medford City Council, according to the best of my ability and understanding, agreeable to the rules and regulations of the Constitution, the laws of this Commonwealth, and the ordinances of the City of Medford.

418
01:00:50,448 --> 01:00:51,689
Congratulations, Councillors.

419
01:01:18,309 --> 01:01:25,695
And now, once again, the inimitable Stacey Clayton to sing Rise Up.

420
01:01:45,185 --> 01:02:09,305
broken down and tired of living life on a merry-go-round and you can't find the fighter but I see it in you so we're gonna work it out and move mountains we're gonna walk it out and move

421
01:02:15,552 --> 01:02:30,299
And I'll rise up, I'll rise like the day I'll rise up, I'll rise unafraid I'll rise up, and I'll do it a thousand times again

422
01:02:31,909 --> 01:02:57,384
And I'll rise up High like the waves I'll rise up In spite of the ache I'll rise up And I'll do it a thousand times again For you For you For you

423
01:03:06,430 --> 01:03:31,663
when the silence isn't quiet and it feels like it's getting hard to breathe but I know you can feel like dying but I promise we'll take the world to its feet and move mountains bring it to its feet and move

424
01:03:34,885 --> 01:03:36,886
mountains.

425
01:03:37,606 --> 01:03:39,307
And I'll rise up.

426
01:03:40,047 --> 01:03:41,928
I'll rise like the day.

427
01:03:42,088 --> 01:03:45,989
I'll rise up in spite of the ache.

428
01:03:46,209 --> 01:03:53,252
I'll rise up and I'll do it a thousand times again.

429
01:03:54,153 --> 01:03:55,193
For you.

430
01:03:55,473 --> 01:03:57,854
For you.

431
01:03:58,214 --> 01:03:58,634
For you.

432
01:04:06,266 --> 01:04:16,711
And for you, all we need, all we need is hope.

433
01:04:18,091 --> 01:04:20,953
And for that, we have each other.

434
01:04:21,933 --> 01:04:25,355
And for that, we have each other.

435
01:04:27,416 --> 01:04:29,857
And we will rise.

436
01:04:30,217 --> 01:04:31,677
We will rise.

437
01:04:32,038 --> 01:04:33,278
We will.

438
01:04:33,658 --> 01:04:34,559
We will rise.

439
01:04:35,889 --> 01:04:41,914
We will rise.

440
01:04:43,155 --> 01:04:44,856
So we'll rise up.

441
01:04:45,777 --> 01:04:47,478
Rise like the waves.

442
01:04:47,539 --> 01:04:48,940
We'll rise up.

443
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:53,183
In spite of the ache, we'll rise up.

444
01:04:54,184 --> 01:04:57,967
And we'll do it a thousand times again.

445
01:05:02,322 --> 01:05:12,530
For you For you For you For you For you

446
01:06:00,119 --> 01:06:09,503
And now returning to us to administer the oath of office to the new school committee, Adam Hurteby, city clerk.

447
01:06:22,995 --> 01:06:24,255
The school committee can rise, please.

448
01:06:26,216 --> 01:06:27,216
And please repeat after me.

449
01:06:27,417 --> 01:06:29,177
Please raise your right hand and repeat after me.

450
01:06:29,197 --> 01:06:31,118
I do solemnly affirm.

451
01:06:31,138 --> 01:06:32,298
I do solemnly affirm.

452
01:06:34,339 --> 01:06:35,679
That I will faithfully and impartially.

453
01:06:35,699 --> 01:06:36,880
That I will faithfully and impartially.

454
01:06:37,580 --> 01:06:38,540
Discharge and perform.

455
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:39,821
Discharge and perform.

456
01:06:40,021 --> 01:06:40,601
All the duties.

457
01:06:41,101 --> 01:06:41,502
All the duties.

458
01:06:41,662 --> 01:06:42,402
Incumbent upon me.

459
01:06:42,422 --> 01:06:43,342
Incumbent upon me.

460
01:06:43,862 --> 01:06:45,083
As a member of the Medford School Committee.

461
01:06:45,103 --> 01:06:47,003
As a member of the Medford School Committee.

462
01:06:47,404 --> 01:06:48,484
According to the best of my ability.

463
01:06:48,504 --> 01:06:50,185
According to the best of my ability.

464
01:06:50,365 --> 01:06:51,005
And understanding.

465
01:06:52,355 --> 01:07:01,893
agreeable to the rules and regulations of the Constitution, the laws of this Commonwealth, and the ordinances of the City of Medford.

466
01:07:02,353 --> 01:07:04,578
Congratulations.

467
01:07:24,443 --> 01:07:32,346
And now to offer words of faith and prayer as we close, Reverend Dr. David M. Kilpatrick of the West Medford Baptist Church.

468
01:07:46,491 --> 01:07:52,814
It's a privilege to be here tonight for a number of reasons, not the least of which is I happen to have a daughter named Brianna.

469
01:07:56,135 --> 01:08:03,317
So it's time to pray for the city of Medford as it enters a new year and a new administration.

470
01:08:03,978 --> 01:08:05,298
We're going to pray for the mayor.

471
01:08:05,338 --> 01:08:07,059
We're going to pray for the city council.

472
01:08:07,099 --> 01:08:08,899
We're going to pray for the school committee.

473
01:08:09,399 --> 01:08:16,962
We're going to pray for all the wonderful departments of the city, police and fire and school and all the many other departments.

474
01:08:17,822 --> 01:08:27,024
and for all of those volunteers who make up committees and commissions and all of the things that make this city such a wonderful place.

475
01:08:27,764 --> 01:08:29,204
So please pray with me.

476
01:08:30,885 --> 01:08:36,286
Almighty God, great is your faithfulness, Lord, to us.

477
01:08:37,206 --> 01:08:42,307
Even on this mild January evening, new mercies we see.

478
01:08:43,544 --> 01:08:48,728
Your word says every good and perfect gift comes from the Father of Lights.

479
01:08:50,069 --> 01:08:53,852
Our mayor has never claimed to be perfect, but she is good.

480
01:08:54,853 --> 01:09:01,878
Good to those who know her, good to the country she has served, good for the community she leads.

481
01:09:02,879 --> 01:09:08,704
And so we end this day with a prayer of thanksgiving for our mayor, Brianna Longo Kern.

482
01:09:09,912 --> 01:09:17,966
Yet even as we thank you that she is with us today, we set her apart from us on this day for the task of leadership.

483
01:09:19,008 --> 01:09:19,548
Be with her.

484
01:09:20,449 --> 01:09:22,269
Establish the work of her hands.

485
01:09:22,829 --> 01:09:27,951
Allow her to keep her heart of service even when some don't want to be served.

486
01:09:28,712 --> 01:09:33,353
Empower her to keep her tongue of eloquence even when the critics are harsh.

487
01:09:34,354 --> 01:09:39,576
Ensure her heart to be full of hope even when the malaise of apathy is around.

488
01:09:40,936 --> 01:09:52,220
Father, your word has shown us that good leadership demands good character, and so we thank you for Breonna's heart, her integrity, and her service to you.

489
01:09:53,381 --> 01:09:58,762
Father, even in this day that values pragmatism, keep this mare principled.

490
01:09:59,943 --> 01:10:04,825
In this day that values the shortcut, give her a vision for the long haul.

491
01:10:06,010 --> 01:10:10,594
In this day of gotcha politics, keep her mind on true public service.

492
01:10:11,654 --> 01:10:22,183
And Father, we recognize that even though the waters appear calm on this beautiful January evening, there are some rip currents in this community.

493
01:10:23,063 --> 01:10:33,411
There are some people and institutions who are on the surface give the appearance of integrity, but underneath have a swift current of injustice guiding their actions.

494
01:10:34,452 --> 01:10:38,596
Father, give this mare a soft hand and a stiff backbone.

495
01:10:39,436 --> 01:10:45,181
Give her a quiet determination that marches toward justice, no matter what she may face.

496
01:10:46,022 --> 01:10:50,426
Let her be as wise as serpents and as innocent as doves.

497
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:55,891
And not just her, Father, but with us all as well.

498
01:10:56,751 --> 01:11:01,315
Let us all be voices of encouragement that drown out the voices of pessimism.

499
01:11:02,389 --> 01:11:05,791
Let us be quick to act when most are quick to just talk.

500
01:11:06,791 --> 01:11:12,434
Let us love in a way that challenges the powerful and comforts the downtrodden.

501
01:11:13,494 --> 01:11:22,819
Father, we also ask your blessing on the members of the City Council, the School Committee, all the employees and volunteers of the City of Medford,

502
01:11:23,735 --> 01:11:29,700
Working together, they can make this community a place that all of us can be proud to be a part of.

503
01:11:30,921 --> 01:11:34,944
And finally, Father, let this be a day for the children of Medford.

504
01:11:35,884 --> 01:11:39,987
Let Breonna's life and position be one that encourages hope,

505
01:11:40,894 --> 01:11:44,678
and possibility from High Street to Mystic Avenue.

506
01:11:45,478 --> 01:11:55,908
Let all the children of Medford know that leadership, influence, and service is just as likely to come from Jerome Street as it is from Main Street.

507
01:11:57,082 --> 01:12:01,967
Lord, all that these leaders will need, you will provide.

508
01:12:02,748 --> 01:12:07,073
So give them strength for today and a bright hope for tomorrow.

509
01:12:07,874 --> 01:12:10,217
In the name of the Lord of us all, we pray.

510
01:12:11,017 --> 01:12:11,338
Amen.

511
01:12:41,869 --> 01:12:53,357
Now to close us out, in delightful song, You'll Never Walk Alone, performed by members of the Medford Community Chorale, led by Betsy Pace, with Michelle Corrado on flute.

512
01:13:16,272 --> 01:13:29,900
Hold your head up high, and don't be afraid of the dark.

513
01:13:34,016 --> 01:13:53,908
At the end of the storm is a golden sky, and the sweet silver song of a lark.

514
01:13:54,648 --> 01:13:57,470
Walk on through.

515
01:14:06,580 --> 01:14:08,951
Oh say does that star spangled banner yet wave

516
01:14:47,606 --> 01:15:07,072
When you walk through a storm, hold your head up high, and don't be afraid of the dark.

517
01:15:16,271 --> 01:15:16,936
And the sweet sound of a lullaby.

518
01:16:14,659 --> 01:16:14,839
Amen.

519
01:16:41,277 --> 01:16:43,139
Congratulations, Madam Mayor.

520
01:16:43,580 --> 01:16:45,262
Congratulations, school committee.

521
01:16:45,703 --> 01:16:47,445
Congratulations, city council.

522
01:16:47,845 --> 01:16:51,410
And congratulations to the city of Medford on getting it right.
