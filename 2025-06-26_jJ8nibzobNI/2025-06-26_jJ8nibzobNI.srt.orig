1
00:00:00,131 --> 00:00:07,133
[SPEAKER_11]: So for those that are joining regularly, I'm so sorry, I'm going to repeat myself for the first five minutes.

2
00:00:08,493 --> 00:00:15,635
[SPEAKER_11]: But this is also for the people that doesn't know what we are doing and also the meetings that we are going to be having in the next weeks.

3
00:00:16,756 --> 00:00:19,177
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm going to go through the process timeline.

4
00:00:19,957 --> 00:00:23,198
[SPEAKER_11]: What are we doing in this third stage of 2025?

5
00:00:25,147 --> 00:00:31,271
[SPEAKER_11]: of this project when you have the opportunities to come and do the public comments and join in our meetings.

6
00:00:32,211 --> 00:00:38,675
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we will be talking about Tufts University, that special district that we are talking about.

7
00:00:40,496 --> 00:00:47,600
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have this process we are following in the planning and permitting committee meetings.

8
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:52,223
[SPEAKER_11]: These are, let's say, the base where we start presenting

9
00:00:53,678 --> 00:01:00,521
[SPEAKER_11]: The projects we are doing right now, we did residential frameworks, we are doing commercial framework right now.

10
00:01:00,581 --> 00:01:07,344
[SPEAKER_11]: So really rezoning, going through all the zoning, the current zoning in Medford.

11
00:01:08,305 --> 00:01:10,926
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you're interested, it is very important.

12
00:01:10,966 --> 00:01:13,867
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you're new to this and you want to know and you're curious,

13
00:01:14,284 --> 00:01:15,225
[SPEAKER_11]: please join.

14
00:01:15,465 --> 00:01:19,287
[SPEAKER_11]: So the next planning and permitting committee meeting, it will be in May 14.

15
00:01:19,787 --> 00:01:25,270
[SPEAKER_11]: And we will be talking about other corridors that I can explain a little bit.

16
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:31,913
[SPEAKER_11]: Then we have the, so here are basically when you have the opportunity to have public comments.

17
00:01:32,434 --> 00:01:38,897
[SPEAKER_11]: So in these planning and permitting committee meetings, there are always the space to listen from the public.

18
00:01:39,417 --> 00:01:49,140
[SPEAKER_11]: Then we also have once the planning and committee committee meeting, they refer and they agree to what we have presented.

19
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:53,322
[SPEAKER_11]: Then they refer that proposal to the city board.

20
00:01:54,809 --> 00:02:05,080
[SPEAKER_11]: And so here we have the few of the latest meetings that we have had, and then we will have the next one on May 7th about the residential districts.

21
00:02:06,342 --> 00:02:08,785
[SPEAKER_11]: So we are reviewing all the residential districts.

22
00:02:09,105 --> 00:02:11,448
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you're interested in that,

23
00:02:11,908 --> 00:02:15,090
[SPEAKER_11]: The City Board is also a place to give your public comment.

24
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:21,373
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we are doing public meetings, Q&A sessions, as the one we have today.

25
00:02:23,694 --> 00:02:30,757
[SPEAKER_11]: The special district from Redford Tufts, but then we will have also next week about squares and the ADUs.

26
00:02:33,032 --> 00:02:45,008
[SPEAKER_11]: These are in the zoning website, so if you're interested in any topic specific, you can look at it and join us.

27
00:02:45,767 --> 00:02:59,670
[SPEAKER_11]: So, what we are doing is we have been looking at the comprehensive plan that was released in January 2023 also the climate action and adaptation plan that was released in April 2022nd and all the things that are related to zoning.

28
00:02:59,911 --> 00:03:08,953
[SPEAKER_11]: We are bringing those principles that were identified during this plans and we are applying into the zoning.

29
00:03:08,993 --> 00:03:09,613
[SPEAKER_11]: So we are.

30
00:03:10,211 --> 00:03:20,115
[SPEAKER_11]: looking through the whole current zoning that Medford has and going through it little by little, area by area.

31
00:03:21,176 --> 00:03:23,937
[SPEAKER_11]: In the comprehensive plan, we have this map, this vision map.

32
00:03:24,457 --> 00:03:32,821
[SPEAKER_11]: They divided the city in all these different areas, so corridors, squares, the residential with different densities.

33
00:03:34,065 --> 00:03:40,229
[SPEAKER_11]: special areas and then the civic and institution anchors we are looking today at Medford Tufts.

34
00:03:41,249 --> 00:03:47,993
[SPEAKER_11]: And so what we did is following the same system and looking at the city through all these different layers.

35
00:03:50,602 --> 00:03:57,867
[SPEAKER_11]: So just to give a heads up, this is the residential district that was referred from the city council to city board.

36
00:03:58,067 --> 00:03:59,668
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the one that we will be discussing.

37
00:03:59,748 --> 00:04:02,890
[SPEAKER_11]: We are updating because we had the public meeting.

38
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:03,771
[SPEAKER_11]: We had some comments.

39
00:04:04,231 --> 00:04:08,553
[SPEAKER_11]: We are re-updating this map and we will give a proposal next week.

40
00:04:10,194 --> 00:04:13,797
[SPEAKER_11]: And here are all the quarters and different districts that are non-residential.

41
00:04:14,957 --> 00:04:18,900
[SPEAKER_11]: And we are looking today at this institutional Medford Tufts.

42
00:04:20,638 --> 00:04:24,564
[SPEAKER_11]: So going already now, yes, into new content.

43
00:04:25,946 --> 00:04:30,894
[SPEAKER_11]: So here is a Google image of your campus, the Tufts campus.

44
00:04:34,505 --> 00:04:36,207
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not saying nothing new.

45
00:04:36,587 --> 00:04:38,689
[SPEAKER_11]: It is divided between Medford and Somerville.

46
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:42,132
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to make clear where that line goes through.

47
00:04:42,152 --> 00:04:47,276
[SPEAKER_11]: And what you've seen is a proposed district boundary.

48
00:04:47,296 --> 00:04:51,440
[SPEAKER_11]: And we are here today to look at this boundary.

49
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,623
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is nothing that is set as definitive.

50
00:04:55,683 --> 00:04:57,505
[SPEAKER_11]: This is something that we are looking into.

51
00:04:57,525 --> 00:05:02,329
[SPEAKER_11]: And that we want today your comments on what you think

52
00:05:02,829 --> 00:05:04,130
[SPEAKER_11]: these boundaries should be.

53
00:05:05,352 --> 00:05:10,957
[SPEAKER_11]: So what we want is to keep the feeling of the campus as together as possible.

54
00:05:11,557 --> 00:05:19,865
[SPEAKER_11]: What I can tell you is already that there are areas that we want, some areas are very clear that they need to be together, that they are part of the campus.

55
00:05:21,066 --> 00:05:26,031
[SPEAKER_11]: But some areas start to, like for example, this corner in the northern area,

56
00:05:28,355 --> 00:05:36,418
[SPEAKER_11]: We want to also ask and question if you think that this should be included, if you think that it shouldn't be included.

57
00:05:36,438 --> 00:05:46,142
[SPEAKER_11]: We also have the part of what is the quarter of Boston Avenue north of Boston Avenue on the other side.

58
00:05:47,863 --> 00:05:50,704
[SPEAKER_11]: And right now we have the boundary up to the trail tracks.

59
00:05:51,124 --> 00:05:58,247
[SPEAKER_11]: So do we want this to be part of the campus or should be part of the corridor that we are also looking into?

60
00:05:58,267 --> 00:06:01,548
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we have the fields.

61
00:06:01,648 --> 00:06:10,831
[SPEAKER_11]: We do think that they should go with the campus, but just there are some edges that we need to be very careful and look at that.

62
00:06:12,192 --> 00:06:21,901
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, the other area that we would like to continue looking into is, or more specifically that we have that question, is this industrial area.

63
00:06:21,921 --> 00:06:25,084
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's almost all of that.

64
00:06:25,365 --> 00:06:33,372
[SPEAKER_11]: This is owned by Medford Hubs, but if you think that it should be extended or not, we would love to hear from you.

65
00:06:34,073 --> 00:06:36,093
[SPEAKER_11]: So again, this is nothing that is definitive.

66
00:06:36,133 --> 00:06:42,855
[SPEAKER_11]: We are still looking at it, and we want your input.

67
00:06:44,435 --> 00:06:51,296
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just want to talk a little bit about the current zoning that you have.

68
00:06:51,336 --> 00:06:54,077
[SPEAKER_11]: So we are looking at this area.

69
00:06:54,097 --> 00:06:55,617
[SPEAKER_11]: I have it then zoomed in.

70
00:06:56,977 --> 00:07:02,018
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is part, there is no, as Alicia said, Director Hunt said, there is no

71
00:07:02,925 --> 00:07:08,047
[SPEAKER_11]: campus district in Medford.

72
00:07:08,967 --> 00:07:11,328
[SPEAKER_11]: There is in Somerville, but not in Medford.

73
00:07:11,388 --> 00:07:20,152
[SPEAKER_11]: And so they are using the existing districts that are in the whole city distributed along Medford.

74
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:26,575
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have in the same district supply to a campus, which is not the best solution.

75
00:07:27,135 --> 00:07:28,236
[SPEAKER_11]: And which ones are those?

76
00:07:28,296 --> 00:07:32,480
[SPEAKER_11]: We have apartment two, that's the big area, the dark orange.

77
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:36,303
[SPEAKER_11]: Then we have this light orange, this is general residential.

78
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:40,266
[SPEAKER_11]: Then we have a little bit of that industrial, this is the grey area.

79
00:07:40,746 --> 00:07:47,231
[SPEAKER_11]: And then this pink triangle is the commercial one.

80
00:07:47,992 --> 00:07:48,953
[SPEAKER_11]: So these

81
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:49,970
[SPEAKER_11]: areas.

82
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:53,752
[SPEAKER_11]: Now I'm going to explain what is important to know about each of this.

83
00:07:55,152 --> 00:08:12,160
[SPEAKER_11]: So if I start in commercial one, what I'm interested is to tell you what are the heights mainly and these are all the dimension standards that these districts have.

84
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:19,343
[SPEAKER_11]: How Medford is done, usually you have a district and then the dimension standards apply to that district.

85
00:08:19,935 --> 00:08:22,137
[SPEAKER_11]: In Medford, we have it by use.

86
00:08:22,617 --> 00:08:31,824
[SPEAKER_11]: So a multiple dwelling is going to have a set of dimensionless standards and it's going to be in the different districts.

87
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,085
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's by district and by use.

88
00:08:35,186 --> 00:08:38,448
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a little bit different than in other communities.

89
00:08:39,009 --> 00:08:43,652
[SPEAKER_11]: So in commercial one, we will have six stories maximum,

90
00:08:45,298 --> 00:08:52,148
[SPEAKER_11]: for multiple dwelling and we have hotel 15 stories high.

91
00:08:52,348 --> 00:09:01,821
[SPEAKER_11]: So in this area is permitted and hotel 15 stories high and a multiple dwelling six stories high and that's in this commercial one triangle.

92
00:09:03,054 --> 00:09:12,156
[SPEAKER_11]: For apartment 2, and this is the dark orange that is in all campus, what we have is multiple dwelling is also six stories highest maximum.

93
00:09:12,956 --> 00:09:24,579
[SPEAKER_11]: Then they have also other permitted principal structures, and that is anything that is not detached, single-family, two-family, multiple dwelling, or assisted living.

94
00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:31,221
[SPEAKER_11]: That other permitted principal structures in apartment 2 that are not those that I mentioned,

95
00:09:31,761 --> 00:09:38,043
[SPEAKER_11]: it can go up to 15 stories high and that will be applied to all these areas.

96
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:45,846
[SPEAKER_11]: You could have those other permitted structures of 15 or the six-story multifamily.

97
00:09:48,307 --> 00:09:52,369
[SPEAKER_11]: Then we have general residential and these are lower general residential and industrial.

98
00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:58,811
[SPEAKER_11]: They go up to three for general residential as maximum and industrial two stories high.

99
00:10:01,161 --> 00:10:03,342
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the context that we have.

100
00:10:04,823 --> 00:10:06,605
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, I'm going to stop sharing.

101
00:10:06,645 --> 00:10:13,129
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want me to share again the map or the boundary, I can do that with your questions.

102
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:17,252
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to stop and would love to hear from all of you.

103
00:10:17,633 --> 00:10:17,893
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

104
00:10:21,523 --> 00:10:22,184
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Paula.

105
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:28,854
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so this is going to be our first opportunity for hearing from you this evening.

106
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:33,581
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can raise your hand using the raise hand function on Zoom.

107
00:10:33,921 --> 00:10:36,064
[SPEAKER_06]: If you can't find it, you can wave your hand at me.

108
00:10:38,086 --> 00:10:43,009
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can also type your comments or questions into the Q&A function.

109
00:10:43,049 --> 00:10:44,831
[SPEAKER_06]: I see some folks are using that already.

110
00:10:44,931 --> 00:10:45,391
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

111
00:10:46,072 --> 00:10:53,377
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you open the Q&A function at the bottom of the screen, you'll be able to view all the other questions and comments that other people have had.

112
00:10:53,777 --> 00:11:00,101
[SPEAKER_06]: You can feel free to hit the thumbs up button to quote unquote upvote those.

113
00:11:00,161 --> 00:11:05,125
[SPEAKER_06]: And that gives us good data on what are opinions or questions that are shared amongst the group.

114
00:11:06,448 --> 00:11:06,988
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, great.

115
00:11:07,028 --> 00:11:13,353
[SPEAKER_06]: So we are going to set a timer for all participants tonight for five minutes.

116
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:14,554
[SPEAKER_06]: That's more than we usually do.

117
00:11:15,094 --> 00:11:16,095
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't want to cut you off.

118
00:11:16,135 --> 00:11:17,736
[SPEAKER_06]: We really want to hear everything from everybody.

119
00:11:17,776 --> 00:11:22,899
[SPEAKER_06]: This is just to make sure that we keep things moving and that everybody does get a chance to speak.

120
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:28,223
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you don't get all to all of your comments the first time around, you're welcome to just put your hand right back up.

121
00:11:31,527 --> 00:11:32,307
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, great.

122
00:11:32,447 --> 00:11:34,608
[SPEAKER_06]: I will go first to John.

123
00:11:34,628 --> 00:11:36,668
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to click the unmute button for you.

124
00:11:37,729 --> 00:11:38,029
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead.

125
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:41,950
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm unmuted now.

126
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:44,090
[SPEAKER_12]: OK, thank you.

127
00:11:44,451 --> 00:11:44,771
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

128
00:11:46,111 --> 00:11:47,431
[SPEAKER_12]: That was a great presentation.

129
00:11:47,451 --> 00:11:52,533
[SPEAKER_12]: Although I don't understand all of it, more or less in simple terms is better for me.

130
00:11:52,933 --> 00:11:54,133
[SPEAKER_12]: But can you put the map up?

131
00:11:55,694 --> 00:11:56,454
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's helpful.

132
00:12:01,743 --> 00:12:08,307
[SPEAKER_12]: I live at 94 College Ave, which I think is in that, excuse me, in that residential section.

133
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:13,390
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.

134
00:12:14,211 --> 00:12:18,213
[SPEAKER_12]: So the other map is better with the colors.

135
00:12:19,354 --> 00:12:21,555
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry to use my time, but I'll be brief anyway.

136
00:12:21,756 --> 00:12:23,397
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm the one with the map.

137
00:12:23,497 --> 00:12:23,677
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

138
00:12:23,917 --> 00:12:24,197
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.

139
00:12:24,537 --> 00:12:26,078
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm in sort of like that.

140
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:30,568
[SPEAKER_12]: I know the parks where the dotted lines are.

141
00:12:30,608 --> 00:12:34,029
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm sort of like where the LA Pearson school is.

142
00:12:34,089 --> 00:12:41,272
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's over there where it looks like the number one, it actually looks like the number one, and it's sort of in a tan shade.

143
00:12:42,212 --> 00:12:55,637
[SPEAKER_12]: So based on what you're saying, is anything in that area, where you mentioned residential, commercial, three stories high, is that the current zoning or proposed zoning?

144
00:12:56,397 --> 00:12:57,498
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the current zoning.

145
00:12:57,918 --> 00:12:58,138
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

146
00:12:59,347 --> 00:13:03,028
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, I'm very familiar with that because I've lived at that area for about 60 years.

147
00:13:03,788 --> 00:13:07,429
[SPEAKER_12]: And I remember before all those buildings were built, except the original gym.

148
00:13:08,309 --> 00:13:26,713
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, so, um, how did that, I remember one time that there was something that the main street for that particular location was called a jab and, uh, buildings could only be built a certain height.

149
00:13:27,726 --> 00:13:29,086
[SPEAKER_12]: And I forget what that was.

150
00:13:29,206 --> 00:13:35,708
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that all the way now and really anything in that number one could go three stories high?

151
00:13:36,308 --> 00:13:37,508
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that how it works right now?

152
00:13:41,009 --> 00:13:43,950
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, let's see the number one college, which says Frederick Gav.

153
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:49,972
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know how to for me to point and show you where he's talking about.

154
00:13:50,672 --> 00:13:51,832
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the light orange.

155
00:13:51,912 --> 00:13:55,053
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the area that is general residential now.

156
00:13:55,073 --> 00:13:55,453
[SPEAKER_13]: There you go.

157
00:13:56,253 --> 00:14:03,275
[SPEAKER_13]: And so this is actually the, I do actually want to raise that I'm less concerned about what it is now because we can make it whatever we want.

158
00:14:03,655 --> 00:14:08,797
[SPEAKER_13]: So what would you like, talk to us about what you would like to see them be able and not able to do.

159
00:14:10,277 --> 00:14:23,161
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I'll tell you from history, at one time before that nice new building was built, there was supposed to be some dormitories built there, which now ended up on Boston Ave.

160
00:14:23,901 --> 00:14:25,862
[SPEAKER_12]: I definitely think if anything goes in there,

161
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:31,671
[SPEAKER_12]: You can see the density all around there of all the residential, and that's why that's like that.

162
00:14:32,412 --> 00:14:42,839
[SPEAKER_12]: So I definitely think that nothing should go in there that would be sort of like housing, sort of like dormitories.

163
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:44,361
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be a disaster.

164
00:14:44,401 --> 00:14:45,581
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think that would float.

165
00:14:45,661 --> 00:14:48,424
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think the residents would be very happy with that, me included.

166
00:14:50,285 --> 00:14:52,907
[SPEAKER_12]: As for right now, I'm in the most perfect spot.

167
00:14:52,967 --> 00:14:54,048
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm at the very point.

168
00:14:54,968 --> 00:15:02,874
[SPEAKER_12]: And whether Yelley Pearson school is, which is at the top of the number one, it looks like a number one or number seven on the right point.

169
00:15:03,815 --> 00:15:07,417
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, I just want to be careful three stories high.

170
00:15:07,658 --> 00:15:09,399
[SPEAKER_12]: I would not want to see anything more than that.

171
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:16,844
[SPEAKER_12]: And I want it would be more academic as opposed to, um, dormitory type facilities.

172
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:21,448
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean,

173
00:15:21,972 --> 00:15:28,474
[SPEAKER_12]: I could see right now if there was someone actually mentioned, I think the school is actually thinking of putting a skating rink in there in the back.

174
00:15:29,035 --> 00:15:35,817
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, you know, things like that I think would be more acceptable than where there would be a lot of kids running around.

175
00:15:37,753 --> 00:15:38,373
[SPEAKER_12]: Am I clear?

176
00:15:38,594 --> 00:15:40,795
[SPEAKER_12]: Am I making any sense to anybody out there?

177
00:15:41,195 --> 00:15:42,376
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's very helpful.

178
00:15:42,456 --> 00:15:42,936
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

179
00:15:43,116 --> 00:15:46,138
[SPEAKER_13]: We appreciate that, and that's useful to understand.

180
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:56,503
[SPEAKER_13]: You're suggesting that on the, what I would call the residential Medford side of Boston Ave, you don't think they should be allowed to put dorms in that area?

181
00:15:57,104 --> 00:15:57,524
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly.

182
00:15:57,544 --> 00:16:01,046
[SPEAKER_12]: They tried that once unsuccessfully many years ago.

183
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:02,066
[SPEAKER_12]: I was here.

184
00:16:04,099 --> 00:16:08,142
[SPEAKER_12]: I think all those people, you can just see all those houses if you look at that.

185
00:16:08,162 --> 00:16:12,546
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's all little houses around there.

186
00:16:14,087 --> 00:16:15,988
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we're in a good part of the campus.

187
00:16:16,028 --> 00:16:16,829
[SPEAKER_12]: We have the fields.

188
00:16:16,849 --> 00:16:19,171
[SPEAKER_12]: I used to play ball in those fields when I was little.

189
00:16:20,592 --> 00:16:22,673
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's sort of nice the way it is.

190
00:16:22,873 --> 00:16:28,898
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we'd be open for something, but I think it would have to be definitely academic or maybe athletic related.

191
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,862
[SPEAKER_12]: There's probably other people that live in that area that can also comment on that.

192
00:16:34,883 --> 00:16:36,184
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

193
00:16:36,884 --> 00:16:37,745
[SPEAKER_13]: We appreciate that.

194
00:16:37,805 --> 00:16:38,845
[SPEAKER_13]: That's helpful.

195
00:16:38,905 --> 00:16:41,027
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there anything you'd like to add about the main campus?

196
00:16:42,848 --> 00:16:43,428
[SPEAKER_12]: It's beautiful.

197
00:16:43,448 --> 00:16:47,911
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, the main campus is beautiful.

198
00:16:49,612 --> 00:16:57,918
[SPEAKER_12]: I know there's other people that are closer to that, to Boston Ave on that side, that I think probably have a lot more reservation.

199
00:16:59,111 --> 00:17:06,577
[SPEAKER_12]: Probably have more meaningful comment than me, so I leave my time for them on the main campus.

200
00:17:07,098 --> 00:17:07,338
[SPEAKER_13]: Great.

201
00:17:07,578 --> 00:17:07,998
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

202
00:17:08,018 --> 00:17:09,700
[SPEAKER_13]: I thank you very much.

203
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:10,640
[SPEAKER_13]: I appreciate that.

204
00:17:11,021 --> 00:17:19,968
[SPEAKER_13]: And he would actually be helpful to just quickly hit a couple of the questions that have popped up in the Q and a, because I think that they help with contact setting for everybody else.

205
00:17:20,757 --> 00:17:26,941
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, so one was, um, is this for a current proposed project or just general discussion of future possibilities?

206
00:17:27,281 --> 00:17:31,544
[SPEAKER_13]: And I want to be clear that this is about there's no current proposed project.

207
00:17:32,105 --> 00:17:34,406
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, this is for the future.

208
00:17:34,426 --> 00:17:43,472
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, one of the things that that came out with the zoning, uh, with the the dorm proposal was that, um, there

209
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:53,224
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think actually I'm going to combine this with the answer to somebody else also asked if we could talk about what the city can do with the limitations of Dover, let me put those two together.

210
00:17:53,825 --> 00:17:56,470
[SPEAKER_13]: So, when we got the dorm proposal.

211
00:17:57,668 --> 00:18:02,131
[SPEAKER_13]: we had no say on anything that was within our current zoning.

212
00:18:02,631 --> 00:18:08,394
[SPEAKER_13]: So if Tufts said, you know, we want to do X and X is within your zoning.

213
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:11,876
[SPEAKER_13]: And this, in that case, it was, we want to build a 10 story building.

214
00:18:11,956 --> 00:18:13,497
[SPEAKER_13]: And that was within our zoning.

215
00:18:14,357 --> 00:18:19,660
[SPEAKER_13]: Then we couldn't say no, and we couldn't even make them justify why they needed that big of a building.

216
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:24,163
[SPEAKER_13]: If for example, the zoning had been five stories in that area,

217
00:18:24,859 --> 00:18:29,141
[SPEAKER_13]: then we would not have been able to say no to anything up to five stories.

218
00:18:29,481 --> 00:18:36,565
[SPEAKER_13]: And anything over five stories, they would have had to justify why they need it.

219
00:18:36,905 --> 00:18:48,391
[SPEAKER_13]: It probably would have been hard pressed for us to say no to it, but they would have had to make an argument and show us the need to be more than five stories, for example.

220
00:18:49,474 --> 00:18:57,981
[SPEAKER_13]: And so that's part of where we want to talk about the zoning is a box of anything they do within the zoning within the box.

221
00:18:58,501 --> 00:18:59,402
[SPEAKER_13]: They can do by right.

222
00:19:00,065 --> 00:19:02,426
[SPEAKER_13]: And then there's the stuff that they have to do.

223
00:19:02,786 --> 00:19:07,108
[SPEAKER_13]: They have to come and argue and present and give rationale for.

224
00:19:08,229 --> 00:19:15,753
[SPEAKER_13]: But to be clear, things over a certain size, they'll also have to do site plan review, even if it was allowed by right.

225
00:19:16,793 --> 00:19:19,554
[SPEAKER_13]: And so that's some of what we just wanted to get into.

226
00:19:19,574 --> 00:19:28,819
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not sure if that's clear enough about, I mean, maybe Kit, let me ask you, did I make it clear that you understand it and that would help with other people?

227
00:19:32,236 --> 00:19:45,903
[SPEAKER_06]: You're asking if the answer around even in the event of new Tufts institutional zoning, is it clear when those safeguards and extra layers of review process still kick in for Tufts-owned properties?

228
00:19:46,563 --> 00:19:46,743
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

229
00:19:46,783 --> 00:19:51,706
[SPEAKER_13]: There's some general belief that Tufts can do whatever they want because of Dover.

230
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:55,687
[SPEAKER_13]: And the answer is they can't do anything.

231
00:19:56,288 --> 00:20:00,250
[SPEAKER_13]: It's that when it's outside of our zoning, they have to

232
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,781
[SPEAKER_13]: uh, justify it basically.

233
00:20:03,801 --> 00:20:08,423
[SPEAKER_13]: They have to bring forward reasons for it and why they need to do it.

234
00:20:08,883 --> 00:20:15,765
[SPEAKER_13]: If it's out, if it's inside of our zoning, like if it's part of what's allowed by zoning, then they can just do it.

235
00:20:16,286 --> 00:20:19,147
[SPEAKER_13]: And so that's part of why we want to put zoning in place.

236
00:20:19,767 --> 00:20:27,950
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't mean, so for example, if we said that they couldn't build dorms on that stretch of College Ave where the the gyms are,

237
00:20:29,512 --> 00:20:33,438
[SPEAKER_13]: They couldn't then do it by right, but they may come back and say, we want to do it.

238
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:39,106
[SPEAKER_13]: And then they'd have to make some argument as to why they could go should go there and not somewhere else.

239
00:20:39,226 --> 00:20:39,426
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

240
00:20:39,487 --> 00:20:42,130
[SPEAKER_13]: They'd have to put forward.

241
00:20:42,591 --> 00:20:44,414
[SPEAKER_13]: It would be a harder bar to meet.

242
00:20:46,394 --> 00:20:49,296
[SPEAKER_13]: Daniel, do you think I've captured that accurately?

243
00:20:49,316 --> 00:20:57,980
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think that's completely accurate about they wouldn't be able to do dorms because I think that they're classified as a Dover use, which is allowed everywhere.

244
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:04,123
[SPEAKER_08]: So, it would be the dimensional controls, whether the height or the setbacks, things like that.

245
00:21:05,003 --> 00:21:06,544
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I don't think we can prevent a.

246
00:21:11,048 --> 00:21:14,689
[SPEAKER_08]: But heights is different.

247
00:21:14,709 --> 00:21:28,473
[SPEAKER_08]: So, in our zoning ordinance, we allowed the other permanent structures up to 15 stories and that left the door open for these Dover use uses.

248
00:21:29,373 --> 00:21:32,894
[SPEAKER_08]: As there's nowhere else in the zoning ordinance that would cap that.

249
00:21:34,354 --> 00:21:34,995
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's how we.

250
00:21:36,573 --> 00:21:44,599
[SPEAKER_08]: Got into that situation and we want to kind of close that loophole where we don't think that 15 stories is appropriate there, but.

251
00:21:44,619 --> 00:21:51,405
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's just the work in our ordinance.

252
00:21:52,505 --> 00:21:55,408
[SPEAKER_13]: And just to be clear, there is this is not about a specific project.

253
00:21:55,568 --> 00:22:01,793
[SPEAKER_13]: This is actually what do we want to allow over the next 10 to 50 years or 1 to 50 years?

254
00:22:03,374 --> 00:22:04,595
[SPEAKER_13]: It can always be changed, but.

255
00:22:05,382 --> 00:22:07,925
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, do you want to go to the rest of the questions?

256
00:22:08,105 --> 00:22:09,427
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to mark those is.

257
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:11,489
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I do.

258
00:22:11,569 --> 00:22:11,910
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

259
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:18,397
[SPEAKER_06]: And just to cap off that point, I'm glad you flagged that Alicia because I think that is 1 of the concerns that kind of undergirds this whole process as we know that.

260
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:30,367
[SPEAKER_06]: Zoning is the box within development can occur, but especially with a Dover eligible institution like Tufts, it is inherently complicated.

261
00:22:30,407 --> 00:22:32,169
[SPEAKER_06]: There's nothing that the city can do about that.

262
00:22:32,249 --> 00:22:44,759
[SPEAKER_06]: And just to put it one more way, because I know that this is a complicated concept, by way of analogy, one way that this comes up before the city council in a non zoning case is when we have an application for a special permit.

263
00:22:46,986 --> 00:22:53,935
[SPEAKER_06]: If something is technically allowed and it goes through the special permit process, the city cannot be arbitrary.

264
00:22:54,376 --> 00:23:02,566
[SPEAKER_06]: And when it says, okay, yes, we want, for example, this gas station, but not that gas station, because I don't like how it looks over there, but I do like how it looks over there.

265
00:23:02,606 --> 00:23:03,528
[SPEAKER_06]: We're illegally bound.

266
00:23:04,188 --> 00:23:10,373
[SPEAKER_06]: to interpret and enforce what's permitted in a consistent manner.

267
00:23:10,433 --> 00:23:16,097
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's part of what we're talking about with Dover uses as well, is we're setting the bounds of the container.

268
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:23,483
[SPEAKER_06]: And then within that container, we do have to interpret and enforce what's allowed to be developed equally.

269
00:23:23,523 --> 00:23:28,026
[SPEAKER_06]: We can't just be picking and choosing because that opens the city up to liability.

270
00:23:29,047 --> 00:23:34,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so just to try to put that a third way, because it's a really important concept, and I think it's, like, really central to this conversation.

271
00:23:35,349 --> 00:23:36,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, all right.

272
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:40,110
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go back to the hands raised.

273
00:23:40,151 --> 00:23:44,132
[SPEAKER_06]: And another thing I just wanted to flag super quickly, um, I apologize.

274
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:46,412
[SPEAKER_06]: I will get us back to the hands raised in just a second.

275
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:51,574
[SPEAKER_06]: But just because this is a, um, a really common question that's come up, there are other zoning proposals as well.

276
00:23:51,674 --> 00:23:57,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to make it crystal clear, the maps that, um, Paolo was showing before that say current zoning,

277
00:23:58,256 --> 00:24:04,641
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the zoning that is currently on the books that will be changed in one way or another, shaped by this community feedback.

278
00:24:04,701 --> 00:24:05,942
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a current proposal.

279
00:24:06,443 --> 00:24:08,965
[SPEAKER_06]: It's what's on the books and has been on the books for a long time.

280
00:24:09,005 --> 00:24:10,626
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's what we're talking about changing.

281
00:24:11,066 --> 00:24:14,889
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just want to make that clear because I saw a question submitted under the Q&A about it.

282
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:17,151
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know sometimes that trips folks up.

283
00:24:19,253 --> 00:24:19,673
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

284
00:24:20,314 --> 00:24:22,716
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll go back to the hands raised on Zoom.

285
00:24:22,756 --> 00:24:24,257
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll go to A. Bernie.

286
00:24:24,277 --> 00:24:26,919
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to click the unmute button.

287
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:28,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.

288
00:24:29,241 --> 00:24:30,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, hi.

289
00:24:31,563 --> 00:24:32,003
[SPEAKER_05]: I would turn.

290
00:24:32,023 --> 00:24:33,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you see me?

291
00:24:33,144 --> 00:24:33,304
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

292
00:24:33,545 --> 00:24:34,726
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't see you, but we can hear you.

293
00:24:34,886 --> 00:24:35,386
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, OK, great.

294
00:24:35,867 --> 00:24:36,547
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Amy Burness.

295
00:24:36,587 --> 00:24:39,390
[SPEAKER_03]: I live on Burgett Avenue on the Dead End side.

296
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:42,993
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm calling in from my phone, so I looked at the maps.

297
00:24:43,093 --> 00:24:48,877
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the feedback I would like to give is just for our particular area around the university to

298
00:24:51,284 --> 00:24:53,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely lower the building structure.

299
00:24:54,006 --> 00:24:55,187
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we all learned a lesson.

300
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:59,331
[SPEAKER_03]: I've moved here 10 years ago, and it's just been one large building from Tufts after another.

301
00:25:00,032 --> 00:25:07,338
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think if it was lowered significantly, since it is very residential where we are, I don't know what the height should be.

302
00:25:07,745 --> 00:25:10,486
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't, like less than five stories, probably.

303
00:25:10,506 --> 00:25:13,968
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think we need anything significantly tall.

304
00:25:14,008 --> 00:25:24,292
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think ratchet it down in size to keep it with the scope of the types of homes that we all have, which I'm in a single level home, small, it's a really small footprint.

305
00:25:24,312 --> 00:25:25,953
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think lower the better.

306
00:25:25,973 --> 00:25:32,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Does parking fit into this question, like the ratio of parking to homes?

307
00:25:32,496 --> 00:25:35,297
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that came up in some other meetings, or is that out of scope for zoning?

308
00:25:39,069 --> 00:25:40,510
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not out of scope.

309
00:25:40,871 --> 00:25:44,453
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not precisely what we're talking about at this stage of the process.

310
00:25:44,513 --> 00:25:59,383
[SPEAKER_06]: We will do a comprehensive re-evaluation of what parking ratios make sense for which zoning districts will be something that we touch on later in the year-long comprehensive zoning process.

311
00:25:59,883 --> 00:26:04,947
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have thoughts at this stage, please feel free to voice them, but that's not what we're going to be delving deeply into right now.

312
00:26:05,287 --> 00:26:06,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, no, not a big thing.

313
00:26:06,448 --> 00:26:15,414
[SPEAKER_03]: I just think, you know, keep the ratios in a way that would not also make it very reasonable to have a 15-story structure of any kind because we need places to park.

314
00:26:15,434 --> 00:26:22,600
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd say size, just really, really lowering the level of size, of height.

315
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:28,344
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess the other comment was around Boston Ave, I guess that whole way up.

316
00:26:28,464 --> 00:26:32,647
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's my understanding that Tufts currently owns a lot of that property, so I think

317
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:37,673
[SPEAKER_03]: wherever the boundaries are for the zone should make it equal.

318
00:26:37,934 --> 00:26:50,183
[SPEAKER_03]: So for that whole strip, there are obviously a lot of apartments that are there now, but I guess the point would be not to turn it into something that's very, I don't know, leaning towards more urban than residential.

319
00:26:51,212 --> 00:26:58,237
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have an exact definition of that, but it's kind of nice that it's mom and pop shops now and walking to things rather than overdeveloping it.

320
00:26:59,078 --> 00:27:04,522
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it's the type of development, like building requirements, design, is that part of this conversation or not?

321
00:27:06,064 --> 00:27:07,004
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I'll give you an example.

322
00:27:07,545 --> 00:27:11,868
[SPEAKER_03]: I've lived in apartments, and so I feel like a lot of cheap buildings are going up.

323
00:27:12,809 --> 00:27:16,792
[SPEAKER_03]: If we really want people to move in the area and live a long time, there should be some requirements for like,

324
00:27:17,739 --> 00:27:22,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Soundproofing floors, because people will eventually move out when kids move above them and it's noisy floor.

325
00:27:22,962 --> 00:27:25,163
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we want to build community, I just think better.

326
00:27:25,863 --> 00:27:28,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Better materials and soundproofing to keep people in any.

327
00:27:29,065 --> 00:27:33,047
[SPEAKER_03]: Apartments that are built, but if that's out of scope, keep going.

328
00:27:33,187 --> 00:27:33,707
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just my.

329
00:27:35,748 --> 00:27:36,268
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's great.

330
00:27:36,308 --> 00:27:38,829
[SPEAKER_06]: Feel free to put comments like that on the record at this time.

331
00:27:39,129 --> 00:27:40,289
[SPEAKER_13]: That's helpful to hear.

332
00:27:40,309 --> 00:27:53,412
[SPEAKER_13]: I can let you know that we can talk about the exterior of buildings, but we don't have a lot of control or say over the interior, like the floor layouts and things like that, like the soundproofing.

333
00:27:53,792 --> 00:28:05,115
[SPEAKER_13]: However, it is helpful for us to hear that because Danielle and I meet with developers frequently and we can tell them when we're hearing that from residents that that's the kind of thing they need to be looking at.

334
00:28:05,768 --> 00:28:11,872
[SPEAKER_03]: I know a lot of people who ultimately end up moving or selling their condos or apartments because they can't take the noise anymore.

335
00:28:12,312 --> 00:28:20,598
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just feel like if we're building things for long term, just build it better and know that you want to try to keep people there for long so they're part of the community and not transient.

336
00:28:22,979 --> 00:28:23,260
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

337
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:23,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are my comments.

338
00:28:25,061 --> 00:28:25,361
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

339
00:28:25,861 --> 00:28:26,842
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much for your comments.

340
00:28:26,862 --> 00:28:27,742
[SPEAKER_06]: We really appreciate it.

341
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:28,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

342
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:32,931
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, great.

343
00:28:33,972 --> 00:28:39,436
[SPEAKER_06]: I will go to the next person on my screen, which is Judith.

344
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:44,120
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi there.

345
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,222
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you so much for doing this.

346
00:28:46,362 --> 00:28:47,743
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that this is really important.

347
00:28:47,783 --> 00:28:53,228
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to go under an assumption that this is just the first and certainly not the last.

348
00:28:53,308 --> 00:28:58,472
[SPEAKER_15]: And before we wrap up tonight, I'd like to know how best people can email

349
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:01,250
[SPEAKER_15]: either Innis or Ms.

350
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:08,453
[SPEAKER_15]: Hunt or whoever, as they percolate through, thinking more about it and seeing the maps.

351
00:29:08,894 --> 00:29:12,555
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's just sort of something for the sidebar.

352
00:29:12,976 --> 00:29:17,378
[SPEAKER_15]: How do we continue to follow up with you all about continuing thoughts?

353
00:29:17,858 --> 00:29:19,399
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm going to keep going.

354
00:29:19,659 --> 00:29:20,919
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's one question.

355
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:37,234
[SPEAKER_15]: It was really interesting to see the maps because, understandably, I have been, because I live out in Burgett, next to Amy actually, right next door, we've been really, really focused on the dormitory for Boston Avenue.

356
00:29:38,175 --> 00:29:51,192
[SPEAKER_15]: And those of us at the end of Burgett also have the Cummins building, which was thought and is out of scale for everything else that Tufts has on that side of Boston Avenue.

357
00:29:51,933 --> 00:29:56,819
[SPEAKER_15]: So when the gentleman who lives over on Frederick or something brought it up, it will be interesting

358
00:29:58,322 --> 00:30:07,032
[SPEAKER_15]: to see if you can adopt different standards, dimensional standards, for the different areas of the campus where it's relevant.

359
00:30:07,392 --> 00:30:14,139
[SPEAKER_15]: And I would say that on the north side of Boston Avenue, I think I'm on the north side, and where the

360
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:27,430
[SPEAKER_15]: Cummins Building is, and where the gym is, and where the Gantra Center is, and where the Pierce and Stearns Field, you know, those dimensional standards probably ought to be different than they might be on Boston Ave.

361
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:40,560
[SPEAKER_15]: They don't have to be, but they might be, since they really do a butt right against a residential community that I'm not sure, I'm not sure what's happening over there with respect to the zoning, the residential rezoning.

362
00:30:40,581 --> 00:30:41,381
[SPEAKER_13]: I really don't care.

363
00:30:43,303 --> 00:30:43,563
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry?

364
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:47,792
[SPEAKER_13]: Somebody unmuted themselves by accident.

365
00:30:48,192 --> 00:30:53,797
[SPEAKER_13]: We actually should have this set so that people can't unmute themselves until I think we have a zoom bomber.

366
00:30:53,997 --> 00:30:58,140
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, my.

367
00:30:58,561 --> 00:30:58,761
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

368
00:30:58,781 --> 00:30:59,241
[SPEAKER_15]: That's weird.

369
00:30:59,722 --> 00:30:59,802
[SPEAKER_15]: Um.

370
00:31:01,078 --> 00:31:02,759
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think it is really interesting.

371
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:07,521
[SPEAKER_15]: The other thing that I'll say is there are some other Tufts buildings that are isolated.

372
00:31:07,601 --> 00:31:14,104
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's a Tufts building, they redid the school on George Street, sort of almost at the crossroad of Hume and George.

373
00:31:15,224 --> 00:31:24,128
[SPEAKER_15]: And I would say that you ought to be thinking about including all of the buildings associated with Tufts, even if they're not contiguous with the current maps that you have.

374
00:31:25,128 --> 00:31:35,970
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm sure that this happens over in Somerville as well, because Tufts has purchased properties that look more like single or multifamily homes, and they abut residential homes.

375
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:39,071
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just want to bring that up.

376
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:47,952
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that there are some buildings missing from the maps that probably need to be brought into this planning process in the future.

377
00:31:48,512 --> 00:31:50,473
[SPEAKER_15]: And the one on George Street is one of them.

378
00:31:51,973 --> 00:32:06,746
[SPEAKER_15]: I do have, I feel like for those of us who have participated in with the university, its recent buildings in the last 10 years, I think dimensional standards for me are the major focus.

379
00:32:09,451 --> 00:32:25,054
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I understand that the city has a vested interest in density and building density and additional housing, but also there are these really strong residential communities that also have to coexist under that plan.

380
00:32:26,314 --> 00:32:34,476
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm hoping that there will be additional opportunities and that we, if somebody can provide for us where we might send additional comments after this meeting,

381
00:32:35,316 --> 00:32:41,639
[SPEAKER_15]: as people percolate the ideas being presented, I think that that would be great.

382
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,540
[SPEAKER_15]: And I would be interested in doing that.

383
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,101
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think so well on my feet.

384
00:32:45,941 --> 00:32:47,082
[SPEAKER_13]: Great, so thank you.

385
00:32:47,502 --> 00:32:48,923
[SPEAKER_13]: I did just throw it in the chat.

386
00:32:49,023 --> 00:32:59,088
[SPEAKER_13]: The office email addresses the letters OCD, Office of Community Development, OCD, at medford-ma.gov.

387
00:32:59,708 --> 00:33:03,550
[SPEAKER_13]: And we take comments on all the zoning and things there.

388
00:33:04,163 --> 00:33:04,523
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

389
00:33:05,725 --> 00:33:07,406
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much for your comments, Judith.

390
00:33:07,466 --> 00:33:08,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Really appreciate it.

391
00:33:09,008 --> 00:33:18,257
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would also add you can the city council is involved in this process as well, very intimately, along with the zoning consultant and the.

392
00:33:20,926 --> 00:33:22,807
[SPEAKER_06]: and the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability.

393
00:33:22,827 --> 00:33:28,811
[SPEAKER_06]: You're also always welcome to email members of the Planning and Permitting Committee, which I chair.

394
00:33:28,871 --> 00:33:37,737
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're also always welcome to email all members of the City Council because all of us will eventually see all of the zoning proposals that go through this process.

395
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:43,133
[SPEAKER_15]: The only other comment that I have is about the Somerville plan, which is really very Googleable.

396
00:33:43,153 --> 00:33:44,834
[SPEAKER_15]: It is not a long document.

397
00:33:45,335 --> 00:33:48,176
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm really glad you're going to be meeting with Somerville.

398
00:33:48,497 --> 00:34:00,485
[SPEAKER_15]: But the idea of stepping down height requirements or limitations as you approach a residential area, which is exactly what Somerville has done.

399
00:34:01,425 --> 00:34:03,186
[SPEAKER_15]: It's really quite limited for Tufts.

400
00:34:03,226 --> 00:34:17,355
[SPEAKER_15]: Tufts can't build an eight-story building on Powder House Boulevard, I don't believe, because I think it abuts as long as it meets dimensional requirements for the number of feet that you would be from wherever that map is, the perimeter line is.

401
00:34:17,375 --> 00:34:23,039
[SPEAKER_15]: And I do think for Boston Avenue, that's particularly important to make sure that those dimensions

402
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:29,404
[SPEAKER_15]: include Boston Avenue and the hill that comes down to the hillside community.

403
00:34:30,004 --> 00:34:35,569
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just think the Somerville plan is a great jumping off place in a lot of ways.

404
00:34:35,589 --> 00:34:36,809
[SPEAKER_15]: It's already on paper.

405
00:34:39,532 --> 00:34:39,812
[SPEAKER_15]: That's it.

406
00:34:40,012 --> 00:34:40,352
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

407
00:34:40,853 --> 00:34:41,113
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

408
00:34:41,353 --> 00:34:42,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much, Judith.

409
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:45,856
[SPEAKER_06]: And one more thing before we get to the next

410
00:34:46,875 --> 00:34:52,879
[SPEAKER_06]: speaker in terms of other ways to stay engaged with the process and to keep learning about the upcoming meetings.

411
00:34:52,939 --> 00:34:53,899
[SPEAKER_06]: Judith is exactly right.

412
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:59,683
[SPEAKER_06]: This is only the very, very first meeting that we will have on this specific topic of zoning.

413
00:34:59,863 --> 00:35:03,425
[SPEAKER_06]: We will have others in the City Council Planning and Permitting Committee.

414
00:35:04,866 --> 00:35:13,611
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure we'll have many opportunities for public comment there, and then it will go to the Community Development Board public hearing where there's always an opportunity for public comment as well.

415
00:35:14,732 --> 00:35:21,395
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a lot of opportunities that I just threw at you and you can learn about those opportunities at medfordma.org slash zoning.

416
00:35:21,535 --> 00:35:22,455
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll put that in the chat.

417
00:35:24,276 --> 00:35:30,379
[SPEAKER_06]: And that has information about all upcoming public zoning meetings and links for more information.

418
00:35:30,539 --> 00:35:33,960
[SPEAKER_06]: So we hope that everybody will stay as engaged as they wish on this.

419
00:35:36,821 --> 00:35:39,162
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, we will go next to Laurel.

420
00:35:41,337 --> 00:35:41,898
[SPEAKER_06]: Please go ahead.

421
00:35:41,918 --> 00:35:42,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

422
00:35:43,439 --> 00:35:43,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Kit.

423
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:49,366
[SPEAKER_02]: So, as you can see behind me, I have my background on, never mind, I'm outside in the yard.

424
00:35:49,426 --> 00:35:57,574
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I think a number of us actually are direct abutters here to Tufts and are very sensitive to this issue.

425
00:35:58,215 --> 00:36:00,678
[SPEAKER_02]: So, the number of points I would like to make, one is,

426
00:36:01,158 --> 00:36:19,281
[SPEAKER_02]: We do need a map of the rest of the properties that Tufts and Walnut Hill Properties owns up and down Boston Avenue, as Elizabeth said, all the way to 200 Boston Avenue to all the way down the opposite end to Ball Square, just to give an understanding of how much property it actually is, which is

427
00:36:20,002 --> 00:36:22,144
[SPEAKER_02]: well beyond these borders that are here.

428
00:36:22,984 --> 00:36:29,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, we can define a campus map however we want, and this is a good start because it looks like obvious boundaries.

429
00:36:29,769 --> 00:36:35,414
[SPEAKER_02]: But then the reality is that there are so many pieces of property that the university actually owns anyway.

430
00:36:35,534 --> 00:36:37,735
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, hillside hardware.

431
00:36:38,736 --> 00:36:44,641
[SPEAKER_02]: That building itself could easily be a 10-story dorm apartment building in the future with retail on the bottom.

432
00:36:45,863 --> 00:36:53,086
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, you know, that's not beyond the reason of expectation as you kind of build the area here up and down Boston Avenue.

433
00:36:53,566 --> 00:36:57,147
[SPEAKER_02]: So, really the emphasis here is that residents are very.

434
00:36:59,353 --> 00:37:02,335
[SPEAKER_02]: concerns about additional high-rises going in.

435
00:37:02,355 --> 00:37:05,137
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the Cummings building with the two dorms going in now.

436
00:37:06,198 --> 00:37:18,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Surrounding this entire neighborhood with high-rises is just so detrimental, mostly because everything is on that hill and everything, as you know, rolls downhill and the neighborhood is downhill.

437
00:37:18,186 --> 00:37:18,507
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't

438
00:37:19,207 --> 00:37:23,649
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the area that's just very, very sensitive to all of us.

439
00:37:24,309 --> 00:37:26,210
[SPEAKER_02]: We understand Tufts is going to grow.

440
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:27,671
[SPEAKER_02]: We understand they need to make money.

441
00:37:27,791 --> 00:37:33,233
[SPEAKER_02]: And this retail slash commercial opportunity that they have is one of those ways.

442
00:37:33,393 --> 00:37:44,498
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to remind folks, those two 10-story dorm buildings or year-round apartment buildings that are going in on Boston Avenue, that's just the start, right?

443
00:37:44,518 --> 00:37:47,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Because once you have one of those commercial developers that you work with, you kind of

444
00:37:49,481 --> 00:37:51,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Every nail, everything looks like a nail, right?

445
00:37:51,823 --> 00:37:53,344
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have a hammer at your use.

446
00:37:53,525 --> 00:37:59,690
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can imagine a lot of Boston Avenue being redeveloped with that kind of eye.

447
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:05,735
[SPEAKER_02]: And so our point is, if that's going to happen, the neighborhood is restricted to three stories.

448
00:38:06,015 --> 00:38:09,498
[SPEAKER_02]: So how are we stepping down 10 stories to three?

449
00:38:09,539 --> 00:38:10,840
[SPEAKER_02]: That's completely unfair.

450
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:14,383
[SPEAKER_02]: So there has to be some kind of gradation, especially at the edges.

451
00:38:15,944 --> 00:38:22,873
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gross and then this is the reason why so many of us were so upset and offended by this 10-story apartment building.

452
00:38:22,913 --> 00:38:26,598
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like you're going to 10 to 2 stories, like completely unfair.

453
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:33,186
[SPEAKER_02]: But I understand the city has so little power to do anything with this because of the state provision known as Dover.

454
00:38:35,048 --> 00:38:39,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, you can get into that and go research it yourself, but it is a real handicap.

455
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:49,453
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I want is to see how much the city can actually do to enforce, as Judy said, the dimensional enforcement of these buildings, just so we can have reasonable development.

456
00:38:49,893 --> 00:38:52,714
[SPEAKER_02]: We know development's coming, we just want it to be reasonable around the campus.

457
00:38:53,194 --> 00:38:57,436
[SPEAKER_02]: My other issue is the actual drawing of the campus currently as it is now.

458
00:38:58,776 --> 00:39:04,123
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I would really want to see carve-outs of public space like the T Station.

459
00:39:04,143 --> 00:39:12,754
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you see a contiguous map of what Tufts Foundries are and the T Station is included in it, that grates on me, right?

460
00:39:12,774 --> 00:39:14,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's public space.

461
00:39:14,516 --> 00:39:15,458
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's think about

462
00:39:15,878 --> 00:39:33,944
[SPEAKER_02]: very clearly how we define these boundaries, especially when so many of us actually do directly abut tufts, whether you're on the ball field side, or the back of Stern's field, which also frankly have a dotted line, or, you know, down at the other end, it's, it's like, we're all very sensitive to where those borderlines are.

463
00:39:35,325 --> 00:39:36,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Second, thirdly, the

464
00:39:37,177 --> 00:39:38,639
[SPEAKER_02]: hill should be considered, right?

465
00:39:38,919 --> 00:39:51,414
[SPEAKER_02]: So the geographic constraints and conditions of the area, putting the 10-story dorms up on a hill is just difficult for most of us because it's more than 10 stories when you live down below the hill.

466
00:39:52,776 --> 00:39:54,157
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I think that's

467
00:39:54,738 --> 00:39:56,599
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty much my main points here.

468
00:39:56,619 --> 00:39:59,822
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that the city is doing this and that the neighbors have come out to this meeting.

469
00:40:00,282 --> 00:40:01,823
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's just the start of this conversation.

470
00:40:01,843 --> 00:40:07,728
[SPEAKER_02]: I think most of us enjoy most of the time living next to Tufts and having a university in our city.

471
00:40:08,228 --> 00:40:16,495
[SPEAKER_02]: We just want it to be a reasonable development and development that enhances our neighborhood and doesn't take away from it.

472
00:40:16,775 --> 00:40:17,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

473
00:40:21,816 --> 00:40:22,056
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

474
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:26,859
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much, Laurel, for the thoughtful input, as always.

475
00:40:26,959 --> 00:40:27,859
[SPEAKER_06]: Really appreciate it.

476
00:40:30,801 --> 00:40:35,323
[SPEAKER_06]: Going next to James, and I see people using the Q&A function.

477
00:40:35,423 --> 00:40:36,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much.

478
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:37,585
[SPEAKER_06]: Please feel free to continue.

479
00:40:39,986 --> 00:40:41,086
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead, James.

480
00:40:43,508 --> 00:40:44,428
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening, everyone.

481
00:40:44,949 --> 00:40:45,689
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is James.

482
00:40:45,749 --> 00:40:46,369
[SPEAKER_01]: I live at 135 Burgett Ave.

483
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:54,611
[SPEAKER_01]: which is very close to the very dead end, almost right behind the Tufts Community Center.

484
00:40:55,851 --> 00:41:00,193
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanna echo what some of my neighbors have already said, Amy and Judy and Laurel.

485
00:41:01,693 --> 00:41:09,396
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the height restriction is probably one of the biggest things our neighborhood is really frustrated with.

486
00:41:10,716 --> 00:41:11,737
[SPEAKER_01]: Something's gotta be done about it.

487
00:41:11,797 --> 00:41:14,017
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't, in 10, 15, 20 years, like you said,

488
00:41:17,844 --> 00:41:19,886
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be surrounded in these 10-story buildings.

489
00:41:20,667 --> 00:41:24,792
[SPEAKER_01]: Already, so many of us have lost sunlight.

490
00:41:26,133 --> 00:41:33,081
[SPEAKER_01]: For the new dorms that are coming in to Boston Ave, for me specifically, sunset's going to be coming to my house.

491
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:36,681
[SPEAKER_01]: three hours early every day for the rest of my life.

492
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:41,724
[SPEAKER_01]: And for a lot of us, that's a big deal, especially if they have solar and things like that.

493
00:41:42,284 --> 00:41:48,869
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the height restriction is probably one of the biggest things our neighborhood's concerned about.

494
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:57,314
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing I'd like to bring up is, I don't know if it's possible or if it's even part of this, but I wish we could do something to protect Stearns Field.

495
00:41:57,975 --> 00:42:02,238
[SPEAKER_01]: About 10 years ago, Tufts tried to kind of stage it,

496
00:42:03,741 --> 00:42:13,708
[SPEAKER_01]: in conjunction with the Cummings Center and who knows if we didn't step in and try to stop that the dorm that's going into Boston Ave could be going in over there.

497
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:24,155
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope maybe we can do something to protect Stearns Field to keep it from being developed but I don't know if that's a possibility.

498
00:42:25,105 --> 00:42:27,666
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty much all I wanted to add to the meeting.

499
00:42:28,266 --> 00:42:29,646
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank you for doing this.

500
00:42:29,906 --> 00:42:31,307
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank the office for doing this.

501
00:42:31,387 --> 00:42:34,828
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is a great step for us in the neighborhood.

502
00:42:35,248 --> 00:42:36,888
[SPEAKER_01]: And we finally feel like we're being heard.

503
00:42:37,348 --> 00:42:38,029
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.

504
00:42:39,909 --> 00:42:40,129
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

505
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:41,730
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much for being here, James.

506
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:46,451
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for your commentary and for putting that on the record.

507
00:42:49,832 --> 00:42:50,172
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

508
00:42:50,552 --> 00:42:53,733
[SPEAKER_06]: Proceeding right along, we'll go to Erica.

509
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:55,110
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead, Erica.

510
00:42:58,272 --> 00:42:58,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

511
00:42:59,472 --> 00:43:00,313
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Erica.

512
00:43:00,433 --> 00:43:04,794
[SPEAKER_04]: I also live on with many of the other folks on this call.

513
00:43:04,994 --> 00:43:06,935
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, I echo what they say in that.

514
00:43:06,995 --> 00:43:12,918
[SPEAKER_04]: We're very appreciative that you are holding this meeting because sometimes I feel like the tough zoom calls are just.

515
00:43:15,439 --> 00:43:17,060
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, speaking into a vacuum.

516
00:43:18,341 --> 00:43:24,669
[SPEAKER_04]: I do think height restriction is a major priority for all the reasons everyone else has said as well.

517
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:30,877
[SPEAKER_04]: And my question is more around, are there opportunities to incorporate some.

518
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:38,101
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether it's public space, green space, is that part of the zoning conversation?

519
00:43:40,042 --> 00:43:49,025
[SPEAKER_04]: So that would be my question as well as lowering the height restrictions, like everyone else mentioned on this call, because I think 1 of the things that happened.

520
00:43:50,185 --> 00:44:00,614
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, because of the green line, and because of the development, we used to have a little bit more of a buffer between the Tufts campus and with all those trees.

521
00:44:02,135 --> 00:44:07,559
[SPEAKER_04]: So, if there's some way to not make us feel like the walls are closing in, um.

522
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:13,244
[SPEAKER_04]: That maybe would alleviate some of the stress on the neighborhood as well.

523
00:44:13,284 --> 00:44:14,926
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm not sure if that's possible.

524
00:44:15,906 --> 00:44:23,793
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that other cities do that in their zoning as well, but this might be more complicated with it being a university.

525
00:44:23,813 --> 00:44:27,377
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the last thing would be.

526
00:44:29,861 --> 00:44:56,165
[SPEAKER_04]: um it would be helpful to hear what Somerville has done because I wonder if the reason that some of these larger things have moved over onto our side of the tracks if you will are because their laws are more um are stricter um so if we I kind of feel like Medford and Somerville should be on the same page um with zoning for Tufts University so that it doesn't feel like um

527
00:44:57,843 --> 00:45:03,110
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, we're being taken advantage of because our zoning is less restrictive.

528
00:45:03,911 --> 00:45:04,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

529
00:45:04,272 --> 00:45:08,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

530
00:45:08,337 --> 00:45:11,542
[SPEAKER_06]: I really appreciate your comments.

531
00:45:16,203 --> 00:45:22,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, and if you see me looking around my screen in between commenters, it's just because I'm trying to toggle between the timer and the chat.

532
00:45:22,167 --> 00:45:23,828
[SPEAKER_06]: So I apologize if I seem distracted.

533
00:45:23,848 --> 00:45:24,669
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm locked in.

534
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:29,212
[SPEAKER_06]: We will go next to Jeremy Martin.

535
00:45:29,832 --> 00:45:30,452
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for being here.

536
00:45:30,633 --> 00:45:31,033
[SPEAKER_06]: Please go ahead.

537
00:45:32,097 --> 00:45:33,858
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey everyone, thanks for hosting this evening.

538
00:45:33,878 --> 00:45:53,934
[SPEAKER_00]: I do hope that there's an opportunity to hear some of the slides or the information that Paola has about Somerville's zoning and also what other cities are doing to work around or work with Dover because I know that Cambridge has gone a long way and does not allow Harvard's

539
00:45:57,157 --> 00:46:03,062
[SPEAKER_00]: real estate arm to operate in the same way that the university does and other universities.

540
00:46:03,103 --> 00:46:08,427
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's really important context and precedent for what Medford could do and should be doing.

541
00:46:09,148 --> 00:46:11,050
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a bunch of comments and recommendations.

542
00:46:12,431 --> 00:46:21,002
[SPEAKER_00]: I've expressed that I was hopeful that there would be some recommendations or some initial proposals as a part of this discussion.

543
00:46:21,062 --> 00:46:26,610
[SPEAKER_00]: But I echo Judy's comment that I hope that there are more meetings and more discussions

544
00:46:28,171 --> 00:46:30,873
[SPEAKER_00]: with, you know, draft proposals and things like that.

545
00:46:30,933 --> 00:46:32,374
[SPEAKER_00]: Recognize you're just at the beginning.

546
00:46:32,754 --> 00:46:35,996
[SPEAKER_00]: You've heard a lot of these things that you're hearing already tonight from us.

547
00:46:37,877 --> 00:46:41,459
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that, you know, it's already been touched on, but Dover is critical to understand here.

548
00:46:41,499 --> 00:46:42,940
[SPEAKER_00]: It's incredibly complex.

549
00:46:43,961 --> 00:46:52,366
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been brought up that Tufts owns multiple properties that are not technically a part of campus and not really that there were,

550
00:46:53,126 --> 00:46:55,226
[SPEAKER_00]: either residential or commercial spaces.

551
00:46:55,246 --> 00:47:18,591
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's really important that we understand and that the zoning is specific to which parts of Tufts properties Dover applies to or not, um, so that that can be, um, you know, considered and, and that they don't have free for all on properties like, uh, hillside hardware for an, as an example where that shouldn't really be, um,

552
00:47:20,832 --> 00:47:35,609
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed to to grow beyond dimensional standards or height limits or any of the other requirements just because tough says oh well this is what we need to do to break even or to to meet our bottom line on a project that really needs to be thoughtful.

553
00:47:37,371 --> 00:47:54,479
[SPEAKER_00]: I also think related to that, I don't know if there are requirements for other types of developments or commercial uses or properties, but establishing a maximum vacancy timeline for university or university-affiliated properties.

554
00:47:54,519 --> 00:47:57,241
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Hillside Hardware has been sitting there for a long time.

555
00:47:57,761 --> 00:48:02,423
[SPEAKER_00]: We hear a lot about how Tufts wants to activate Boston Avenue, and I think we all agree that that's fantastic.

556
00:48:02,863 --> 00:48:03,884
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a property there that

557
00:48:04,544 --> 00:48:07,006
[SPEAKER_00]: is just begging for something good in it.

558
00:48:07,366 --> 00:48:13,830
[SPEAKER_00]: And so how do we put some pressure on Tufts to both share what they're planning to do there and to do something more expeditiously?

559
00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:21,794
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also heard in our discussions with Tufts, I think they've acknowledged that the retail space in the new dorm building.

560
00:48:22,975 --> 00:48:26,558
[SPEAKER_00]: is really meant to support the students who live in the dorm, ultimately.

561
00:48:26,578 --> 00:48:31,801
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been presented and considered as a community benefit, and it may have some community benefit.

562
00:48:31,922 --> 00:48:46,212
[SPEAKER_00]: But we need to separate these kind of retail things that are good for the community and meant for the community from the things that are just for the students and the campus community, if we want that to be a legitimate benefit to the community.

563
00:48:47,873 --> 00:48:58,259
[SPEAKER_00]: I do hope that the city really takes a hard look at its ordinance language around site plan review for Dover and what is considered a reasonable regulation.

564
00:48:58,279 --> 00:49:02,222
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see how you can say that you can find that height.

565
00:49:02,982 --> 00:49:07,105
[SPEAKER_00]: restrictions are a reasonable regulation, but setbacks are not.

566
00:49:07,846 --> 00:49:11,789
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all the same dimensional standards and they should be followed.

567
00:49:12,730 --> 00:49:24,619
[SPEAKER_00]: And if a project can't meet those setbacks or meet those height requirements, Tufts has to demonstrate the impact and the blow up, you know, how it would hurt or prevent a project from happening.

568
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:27,581
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think the current language in the cities

569
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:36,966
[SPEAKER_00]: ordinance or the way that that is applied through the CDB is actually has enough teeth or enough leverage to force Tufts to do that.

570
00:49:37,026 --> 00:49:39,207
[SPEAKER_00]: So other cities have done this better.

571
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:40,807
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to look at what they're doing.

572
00:49:43,124 --> 00:50:02,408
[SPEAKER_00]: I think also there's this idea that because it's a full campus or because it's a campus, open space calculations and other performance requirements should consider the full campus in all cases because it was done in one project 10 or 15 years ago.

573
00:50:05,569 --> 00:50:13,451
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't reflect the actual impact or considerations for a project that touches a public way or a public space.

574
00:50:14,131 --> 00:50:22,514
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when there are impacts on public spaces, those requirements should be applied to that project site, not to a full campus.

575
00:50:22,634 --> 00:50:27,595
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that would be a way of giving the city much more leverage in site plan review.

576
00:50:28,915 --> 00:50:32,897
[SPEAKER_00]: We all would love to see Tufts being held to an institutional master plan.

577
00:50:35,437 --> 00:50:42,581
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the city needs to do more to encourage the legislature to take that up.

578
00:50:42,921 --> 00:50:55,427
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I've heard city councilors talk about it and I've heard Danielle and others talk about it, but I think we need to put that front and center in setting some expectations and understanding where Tufts is headed.

579
00:50:55,867 --> 00:50:58,268
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll stop there and then I'll raise my hand again because I've got more.

580
00:50:59,637 --> 00:51:00,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Great, thank you so much.

581
00:51:00,898 --> 00:51:01,979
[SPEAKER_06]: Jeremy really appreciate it.

582
00:51:02,499 --> 00:51:10,844
[SPEAKER_06]: And yes, your point is well taken that really advocacy for the institutional master plan should continue until it's effective in case.

583
00:51:10,884 --> 00:51:12,165
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not on anybody's radar.

584
00:51:12,225 --> 00:51:17,989
[SPEAKER_06]: The mayor, the city council did approve a draft home rule petition for an institutional master plan.

585
00:51:18,946 --> 00:51:23,532
[SPEAKER_06]: And just to make sure that I'm noting down your point correctly, Jeremy, about what you were saying there at the end, it sounds like.

586
00:51:35,485 --> 00:51:47,154
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the points you were making was that mitigation for local impacts should be localized at the site where the impacts are happening, not an effect over here in mitigation at the other side of campus.

587
00:51:47,214 --> 00:51:48,935
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that roughly what you were trying to say?

588
00:51:52,903 --> 00:51:54,685
[SPEAKER_13]: He can't unmute unless we send him.

589
00:51:54,785 --> 00:51:55,646
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it.

590
00:51:55,706 --> 00:51:56,066
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

591
00:51:56,647 --> 00:51:57,247
[SPEAKER_00]: Not quite, Kit.

592
00:51:57,267 --> 00:51:59,029
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you following up on that.

593
00:52:00,510 --> 00:52:11,121
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that Tufts calculates it, the way that it meets its open space requirements or its parking requirements or even setbacks, rear yard setbacks,

594
00:52:12,722 --> 00:52:16,844
[SPEAKER_00]: take into account the entire campus and not the project site.

595
00:52:18,424 --> 00:52:30,069
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that allows them to say, hey, we're going to put a massive building on a tiny site, but we don't need to meet open space requirements for that site because we have this great campus associated with it.

596
00:52:30,969 --> 00:52:36,012
[SPEAKER_00]: Or we don't need to meet rear yard setbacks because our rear yard is our campus.

597
00:52:37,472 --> 00:52:54,099
[SPEAKER_00]: And that may work inside the campus, but when you're on the edge of a campus, when you're interacting with a public space or a public way, it should really be about what happens on that site so we don't have massive buildings shoehorned into sites that are frankly just not big enough for them.

598
00:52:55,239 --> 00:52:57,741
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's, I think that it's less about mitigation.

599
00:52:57,801 --> 00:53:08,146
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more about how the very few open space, setbacks, parking, you know, the very few things that Dover allows the city to control.

600
00:53:08,666 --> 00:53:14,329
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, Tufts can use the whole campus to calculate them, and it really should be about a specific project.

601
00:53:15,330 --> 00:53:15,950
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for asking.

602
00:53:16,390 --> 00:53:16,651
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

603
00:53:16,771 --> 00:53:17,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much for clarifying.

604
00:53:17,891 --> 00:53:18,632
[SPEAKER_06]: That's very helpful.

605
00:53:18,652 --> 00:53:19,232
Appreciate it.

606
00:53:21,062 --> 00:53:23,666
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, going next to Daniel.

607
00:53:24,527 --> 00:53:25,108
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead, Daniel.

608
00:53:26,956 --> 00:53:28,017
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks, Councillor Collins.

609
00:53:28,757 --> 00:53:29,858
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm up on Dearborn.

610
00:53:29,878 --> 00:53:35,783
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm a couple blocks away from Tufts campus, not like a lot of people here, but I take the T a lot.

611
00:53:35,803 --> 00:53:39,165
[SPEAKER_14]: So I walk down Boston Ave and over Winthrop right there a lot.

612
00:53:41,167 --> 00:53:47,312
[SPEAKER_14]: I support the idea of activation along Boston Ave, which I know Tufts has sort of put forward.

613
00:53:49,253 --> 00:53:52,916
[SPEAKER_14]: And I guess one of my concerns with Dover is based on my understanding that

614
00:53:54,217 --> 00:54:03,140
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of our hands are tied in a way that even if we, for example, reduce zoning height in some areas, I believe Ms.

615
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:08,062
[SPEAKER_14]: Hunt said that Tufts can come back and say, oh, we have a reason to build here.

616
00:54:08,122 --> 00:54:13,984
[SPEAKER_14]: We have justifications and can sort of get around even that lowered zoning.

617
00:54:14,465 --> 00:54:20,367
[SPEAKER_14]: But that does give us leeway to sort of provide, in my mind, sort of a carrot and a stick.

618
00:54:21,187 --> 00:54:31,573
[SPEAKER_14]: maybe we can focus increased density in some areas that are maybe surrounded by commercial and have lower density elsewhere.

619
00:54:31,613 --> 00:54:43,400
[SPEAKER_14]: So it naturally incentivizes Tufts to put maybe, for example, on Bellevue Street, which is on the southwest side of Boston Ave, but it's across from commercial.

620
00:54:44,688 --> 00:54:51,912
[SPEAKER_14]: You have maybe just a little bit increased density there and height there so that they build there and cascade down the hill and then step it down the hill.

621
00:54:51,952 --> 00:54:54,254
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's not super high along Baston Ave.

622
00:54:54,594 --> 00:55:02,278
[SPEAKER_14]: And then on the other side of the train tracks, along College Ave, we put a really low sort of height and zoning.

623
00:55:02,678 --> 00:55:12,544
[SPEAKER_14]: That way incentivizes or pushes Tufts to put it in places where it's close to the campus, has maybe shadows are on businesses rather than homes.

624
00:55:15,509 --> 00:55:19,471
[SPEAKER_14]: and still allows potentially for some increased activation in the space.

625
00:55:21,132 --> 00:55:29,938
[SPEAKER_14]: I just think maybe that sort of care and stick approach might actually get us more results with Tufts rather than them just running over a lot of the neighborhood.

626
00:55:32,879 --> 00:55:33,760
[SPEAKER_14]: That's it, thank you so much.

627
00:55:36,321 --> 00:55:39,003
[SPEAKER_06]: Great, thank you so much for your comments, Daniel.

628
00:55:41,324 --> 00:55:48,329
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, before we go back to you, Jeremy, I'm just going to go and I just want to read aloud some of the open questions on the Q&A.

629
00:55:48,349 --> 00:55:59,597
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope that people have been reading these and uploading them as they see fit, but I just want to read some of them aloud to get them onto the record and to make sure that people know about them if they haven't been checking this function.

630
00:56:01,138 --> 00:56:04,561
[SPEAKER_06]: So just to read some of these contained concepts that we've touched on before.

631
00:56:06,666 --> 00:56:12,591
[SPEAKER_06]: One says, I definitely would like to know what Somerville has come up with to deal with the many issues associated with Tufts.

632
00:56:13,352 --> 00:56:13,592
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

633
00:56:14,092 --> 00:56:15,173
[SPEAKER_06]: As we know, we'll be looking into that.

634
00:56:19,196 --> 00:56:22,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Another comment about wanting to hear what Somerville and other cities are doing.

635
00:56:28,244 --> 00:56:31,947
[SPEAKER_06]: One resident says, setbacks only matter if the city enforces them.

636
00:56:35,216 --> 00:56:47,875
[SPEAKER_13]: One of the things that one of the comments in there that I think that I just want to make clear because some of some of our, the people here tonight are really aware of tossing their rules and some are newer to the topic.

637
00:56:48,996 --> 00:56:49,196
[SPEAKER_13]: So.

638
00:56:50,473 --> 00:56:54,155
[SPEAKER_13]: has a real estate arm called Walnut Hill properties.

639
00:56:54,875 --> 00:56:57,576
[SPEAKER_13]: This is the same thing that MIT does and Harvard does.

640
00:56:57,756 --> 00:57:03,599
[SPEAKER_13]: They each have, I can't off the top of my head name their real estate arms, but they each have one.

641
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:11,462
[SPEAKER_13]: The real estate arm is a for-profit entity and anything owned by that pays regular property taxes to the city of Medford.

642
00:57:12,342 --> 00:57:17,425
[SPEAKER_13]: And those properties do not fall under the Dover use.

643
00:57:17,825 --> 00:57:34,574
[SPEAKER_13]: They would need to transfer it to the nonprofit arm of, which, and the thing is they could, in theory, transfer something to their, but they have to transfer it to their nonprofit portion of their organization, Tufts University, and they have to use it for a educational use.

644
00:57:34,814 --> 00:57:38,716
[SPEAKER_13]: And dormitories are considered educational, but like an educational building or lab.

645
00:57:39,316 --> 00:57:41,257
[SPEAKER_13]: If they had a building, for example,

646
00:57:41,710 --> 00:57:55,679
[SPEAKER_13]: and they put ground floor bar and pub and coffee shop on the first floor, and they rented out apartments above it to the general public, they would have to pay taxes on it that would not fall under the Dover rule.

647
00:57:56,840 --> 00:58:06,006
[SPEAKER_13]: If they said that those apartments up top were going to be used purely for housing members of the Tufts community, then I think we would start to question that.

648
00:58:06,126 --> 00:58:09,088
[SPEAKER_13]: But they would, again, it would have to be owned by the nonprofit.

649
00:58:10,169 --> 00:58:12,191
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's sort of the gray area.

650
00:58:12,751 --> 00:58:18,516
[SPEAKER_13]: And part of the conversation that I think is a useful one to have is these portions of Boston Ave.

651
00:58:18,956 --> 00:58:36,550
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been my expectation that the portion of Boston Ave where Hillside Hardware from there down is, would not be part of their institutional zone and would end up with some version of one of our mixed use zones requiring some level of ground floor commercial.

652
00:58:38,378 --> 00:58:45,082
[SPEAKER_13]: and then allowing residential above it would be in fact subject to parking, et cetera.

653
00:58:45,862 --> 00:58:48,343
[SPEAKER_13]: That particular, people have asked about this a lot.

654
00:58:48,884 --> 00:58:55,187
[SPEAKER_13]: I've talked to Tufts about that property and they've said that their problem is there's no parking associated with that parcel.

655
00:58:55,867 --> 00:59:04,732
[SPEAKER_13]: So one of the conversations that I'm interested in floating with them is if they were to include in those leases for those apartments,

656
00:59:05,392 --> 00:59:10,855
[SPEAKER_13]: that you would have the right to park on the Tufts campus, would we then consider that to be parking?

657
00:59:11,415 --> 00:59:21,340
[SPEAKER_13]: What if they said that that was going to be, you know, affiliate staff and student apartments with those people being allowed to park their vehicles on campus 24 by 7?

658
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:26,442
[SPEAKER_13]: Would that be sufficient to allow them to then put apartments there?

659
00:59:26,835 --> 00:59:38,118
[SPEAKER_13]: because it has been apartments, and the reason they're not being rented now is because Tufts said it's in such a bad shape that they couldn't possibly put people in those apartments before doing a major renovation.

660
00:59:38,138 --> 00:59:40,798
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is sort of to give you the context.

661
00:59:41,278 --> 00:59:46,260
[SPEAKER_13]: One person asked about to better explain Dover for people who are new to this.

662
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,480
[SPEAKER_13]: Danielle, do you think you could do that?

663
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:55,822
[SPEAKER_13]: I just have to admit, I have COVID, and so I'm not thinking on my feet as quickly as I would usually like to this evening.

664
00:59:57,737 --> 00:59:59,578
[SPEAKER_08]: We're all glad that we're on zoom tonight.

665
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:03,080
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have the.

666
01:00:03,981 --> 01:00:15,328
[SPEAKER_08]: The, the Dover amendment is that's kind of like the, the nickname, because it stems from a case with the town of Dover.

667
01:00:17,615 --> 01:00:28,860
[SPEAKER_08]: Off the top of my head, I don't know what section of Mass General Law it is, but basically it exempts certain uses, religious and educational, institutional uses.

668
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:38,944
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a narrow definition of what qualifies and they're allowed to pretty much go anywhere and

669
01:00:43,117 --> 01:00:52,062
[SPEAKER_08]: they can ask for relief if the zoning that applies to them is not considered reasonable.

670
01:00:52,082 --> 01:00:56,844
[SPEAKER_08]: There's various tests for it.

671
01:00:58,505 --> 01:01:03,608
[SPEAKER_08]: So in the case for Boston Ave, is our zoning allowed?

672
01:01:04,790 --> 01:01:13,477
[SPEAKER_08]: A height greater than what they were asking for, so there was no, the reasonable regulation isn't our existing regulations reasonable.

673
01:01:13,637 --> 01:01:15,339
[SPEAKER_08]: It's if they want to depart from them.

674
01:01:15,699 --> 01:01:22,524
[SPEAKER_08]: So, if they wanted to go higher, then that would have been, they would have been asking.

675
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:27,383
[SPEAKER_08]: to go higher if they thought that the 15 wasn't reasonable.

676
01:01:28,043 --> 01:01:33,767
[SPEAKER_08]: And I noticed a question or a comment in the chat about whether we knew about this loophole.

677
01:01:34,908 --> 01:01:37,530
[SPEAKER_08]: That predates my time, so I don't know.

678
01:01:37,650 --> 01:01:44,255
[SPEAKER_08]: But the recodification actually made it more

679
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:51,306
[SPEAKER_08]: Parent looking at it after the fact, but I can't I don't know why it's even in the ordinance.

680
01:01:51,506 --> 01:01:52,627
[SPEAKER_08]: It predates all of us.

681
01:01:53,968 --> 01:01:54,729
[SPEAKER_08]: We found it.

682
01:01:57,011 --> 01:02:00,435
[SPEAKER_08]: It's unfortunate, but it was not identified.

683
01:02:03,908 --> 01:02:11,131
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, and Emily did drop into the chat for us that the Dover Amendment is part of MGL Chapter 48, Section 3.

684
01:02:11,171 --> 01:02:17,254
[SPEAKER_13]: And Chapter 48 is the state law that controls zoning in Massachusetts.

685
01:02:21,036 --> 01:02:21,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

686
01:02:22,016 --> 01:02:26,038
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Alicia, Danielle, and Emily in the chat.

687
01:02:27,215 --> 01:02:30,479
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, I think I'm going to go back to our additional hands on Zoom.

688
01:02:30,519 --> 01:02:38,707
[SPEAKER_06]: And then at the end, I will just speak aloud any questions in the chat that haven't been already spoken to out loud.

689
01:02:41,751 --> 01:02:46,236
[SPEAKER_06]: So I will go to Jeremy first, then we'll get to Judith.

690
01:02:47,797 --> 01:02:48,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead, Jeremy.

691
01:02:49,302 --> 01:02:49,802
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again.

692
01:02:50,902 --> 01:02:58,264
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a last note on the Dover discussion or the process and review discussion.

693
01:02:58,284 --> 01:03:11,387
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to the institutional master plan, I think that there's an opportunity to establish a requirement for a community working group related to projects that are associated with the neighborhood.

694
01:03:12,227 --> 01:03:23,069
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't think that that would necessarily become a special permit or anything like that, but it's an opportunity before projects get to the point where they are ready to go in the ground.

695
01:03:23,510 --> 01:03:25,530
[SPEAKER_00]: The community has an opportunity to weigh in.

696
01:03:25,550 --> 01:03:27,270
[SPEAKER_00]: The city has an opportunity to weigh in.

697
01:03:28,011 --> 01:03:34,272
[SPEAKER_00]: We've gotten to that with Tufts on the dorm and on Boston Ave, which is appreciated, but it took a lot of

698
01:03:35,336 --> 01:03:40,379
[SPEAKER_00]: leverage to do that and the burden shouldn't be on the community to make that happen.

699
01:03:40,899 --> 01:03:44,321
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if we can get it to be a part of the ordinance and a baseline requirement.

700
01:03:47,523 --> 01:03:51,765
[SPEAKER_00]: Other cities have affordable housing minimums and different requirements.

701
01:03:51,825 --> 01:03:57,369
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that that's really difficult with Dover because it starts to act as a special requirement.

702
01:03:57,549 --> 01:04:03,052
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's a universal requirement for commercial development or residential development,

703
01:04:04,373 --> 01:04:20,950
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a way to apply something like that to Tufts, whether it's as a part of their project, which is also complicated, or a minimum contribution to the new affordable housing trust, which they have done, again, on their own, but it took pressure.

704
01:04:21,250 --> 01:04:25,094
[SPEAKER_00]: And why not start with that as a baseline from the ordinance?

705
01:04:26,556 --> 01:04:31,700
[SPEAKER_00]: You've heard a lot about setbacks, step downs, all of that is really important.

706
01:04:32,961 --> 01:04:51,417
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, I think that they should not be informed by necessarily what each individual thinks is appropriate, but there's an easy way to do it scientifically to study what height would impact adjacent communities, what height of a building would cast shadows on neighbors.

707
01:04:52,778 --> 01:04:57,659
[SPEAKER_00]: And to use that as a way to inform the dimensional or the height standards.

708
01:04:58,439 --> 01:05:02,580
[SPEAKER_00]: I think someone suggested, you know, maybe further into campus buildings could be taller.

709
01:05:02,620 --> 01:05:12,803
[SPEAKER_00]: I think because of the hillside nature of the campus, a taller building on the top of the hill would actually be really detrimental to a much larger swath of the community.

710
01:05:12,883 --> 01:05:19,064
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not hard to do the shadow study and to determine what's going to have minimal or no impact on the community.

711
01:05:19,104 --> 01:05:21,545
[SPEAKER_00]: And that should be the starting point for setting those

712
01:05:22,185 --> 01:05:22,725
[SPEAKER_00]: height limits.

713
01:05:26,168 --> 01:05:27,308
[SPEAKER_00]: Last few here, I promise.

714
01:05:29,129 --> 01:05:36,814
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as performance requirements go, there are some really great performance requirements in our zoning now for non-Dover projects.

715
01:05:36,894 --> 01:05:42,698
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when a project becomes Dover, they seem to get all thrown out the window because we're so limited in what we can

716
01:05:43,899 --> 01:05:55,468
[SPEAKER_00]: what we can request, but I still think it's worth considering ground floor use requirements and minimum publicly beneficial amenity requirements for projects that interact with the public way.

717
01:05:55,668 --> 01:06:02,393
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't want to do that in the middle of their campus, that's great, but if it's on a public street, that should be included as a requirement.

718
01:06:03,674 --> 01:06:04,254
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly,

719
01:06:05,135 --> 01:06:31,103
[SPEAKER_00]: if we're on a public street like Boston Avenue, as a starting point, there should be requirements for public realm improvements for sidewalks and bike lanes and traffic, and not counting on Tufts to do that out of the goodness of their heart, but because it is a requirement that comes along with the scale of development or the type of development that they're proposing in the neighborhood.

720
01:06:32,223 --> 01:06:33,304
[SPEAKER_00]: And then similarly,

721
01:06:35,781 --> 01:06:41,603
[SPEAKER_00]: there should be some standards for light and sound and other environmental impacts that can be applied in there.

722
01:06:41,623 --> 01:06:46,405
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I know that gets tricky with Dover, but I think we should try.

723
01:06:46,425 --> 01:06:49,006
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's all I got.

724
01:06:49,286 --> 01:06:50,386
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the time.

725
01:06:51,346 --> 01:06:52,787
[SPEAKER_00]: Look forward to further conversations.

726
01:06:55,048 --> 01:06:55,308
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

727
01:06:55,728 --> 01:06:56,528
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much, Jeremy.

728
01:06:58,569 --> 01:07:00,390
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, going back to Judith.

729
01:07:00,830 --> 01:07:01,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead, please.

730
01:07:02,671 --> 01:07:04,913
[SPEAKER_15]: Just a couple of unrelated thoughts.

731
01:07:06,174 --> 01:07:12,500
[SPEAKER_15]: So I know that, I guess, is Boston Avenue is going to come up as one of the corridor discussions, correct?

732
01:07:13,161 --> 01:07:22,169
[SPEAKER_15]: And so does that mean that the properties that Tufts currently has that are outside of, I'll say outside of Dover, but a really walnut

733
01:07:22,689 --> 01:07:24,210
[SPEAKER_15]: Walnut Hill, is that the name of it?

734
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:31,854
[SPEAKER_15]: Does that mean that they would then become part of what happens on Boston Ave as part of that corridor conversation?

735
01:07:32,414 --> 01:07:39,618
[SPEAKER_15]: So, for example, you know, I've been, you know, I've been tuning into all of the other communities in terms of their mixed use, your mixed use definitions.

736
01:07:39,698 --> 01:07:40,498
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm assuming that

737
01:07:41,855 --> 01:08:02,128
[SPEAKER_15]: If it is true that the properties owned by Walnut Hill are going to be under some other zoning like mixed use zoning rules, that you have some latitude also there as you do in the other communities with establishing what those dimensional requirements would be.

738
01:08:03,249 --> 01:08:26,020
[SPEAKER_15]: right because that work hasn't been done yet and so it's important for i think for everybody to understand since all of this work is more or less being done simultaneously and i know it's not really i know it's sequential but the residential stuff is going to impact what then the mixed use might look like which then might impact what the tufts institutional plan should look like um so it in

739
01:08:26,820 --> 01:08:28,220
[SPEAKER_15]: they're all connected, right?

740
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:35,262
[SPEAKER_15]: Because they all make up the fabric of what a community looks like, literally, physically, from the sky, from the ground.

741
01:08:35,842 --> 01:08:53,085
[SPEAKER_15]: So I guess I just would like to be sure that, to Laurel's point, I think she brought it up, to really understand what are the Walnut Hill properties that would then fall under mixed use for the corridor, potentially, versus what are the institutional properties.

742
01:08:54,457 --> 01:08:55,298
[SPEAKER_15]: that they own.

743
01:08:55,698 --> 01:09:01,160
[SPEAKER_15]: And again, to include all of them, not just the contiguous ones that were on the existing map.

744
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:06,082
[SPEAKER_15]: The other thing, well, you know what, I can't remember what the other thing was.

745
01:09:06,182 --> 01:09:07,703
[SPEAKER_15]: So I might have to stop there.

746
01:09:08,983 --> 01:09:11,904
[SPEAKER_15]: My brain is as addled as the rest of some of you.

747
01:09:12,004 --> 01:09:16,786
[SPEAKER_15]: So yeah, and I know we'll have other chances to talk about it all.

748
01:09:16,826 --> 01:09:17,667
[SPEAKER_15]: But I do think

749
01:09:18,647 --> 01:09:28,153
[SPEAKER_15]: I think wherever the, I understand Dover is really complicated, it is a sleeper to read about, but it is an interesting thing to read about.

750
01:09:28,233 --> 01:09:34,678
[SPEAKER_15]: Some, an awful lot of decisions go the way of the institutions that are having Dover protections, but not all of them do.

751
01:09:35,518 --> 01:09:50,247
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I think the question of the day is, you know, how does one shore up zoning in a way that protects both universities' right to develop, but also protects the other uses in the abutting communities, like residential neighborhoods?

752
01:09:50,988 --> 01:09:54,210
[SPEAKER_15]: So I would leave it there and look forward to the next one of these.

753
01:09:58,109 --> 01:09:58,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

754
01:09:59,310 --> 01:10:00,271
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much, Judith.

755
01:10:00,511 --> 01:10:09,279
[SPEAKER_06]: And yes, I think you have been a stalwart participant in a lot of our zoning conversations so far.

756
01:10:09,499 --> 01:10:17,005
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think I think you're right to say that these proposals, I think it's a good point that you bring up about these proposals being, I would say, sequential, but overlapping.

757
01:10:17,066 --> 01:10:18,006
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's true that the

758
01:10:20,553 --> 01:10:27,796
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, the conversation about some of our mixed use districts impacts the neighborhood and urban residential impacts the other corridors.

759
01:10:29,096 --> 01:10:41,321
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll absolutely be bringing, considering how those contexts from the different districts impact the many pieces that we are considering at various different stages at the same time.

760
01:10:43,222 --> 01:10:45,283
[SPEAKER_06]: And thank you for speaking to that.

761
01:10:54,972 --> 01:10:58,078
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just going to review and see if there's anything else pressing in the Q&A.

762
01:10:58,098 --> 01:11:01,464
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want to go ahead first or are you going to shift us to the next part of our presentation?

763
01:11:02,904 --> 01:11:09,546
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I just wanted to say that one thing about the Dover, it is very complex.

764
01:11:09,866 --> 01:11:11,827
[SPEAKER_11]: And we understand that it's very difficult.

765
01:11:11,887 --> 01:11:17,288
[SPEAKER_11]: It's even difficult for people that have been working with that for many, many years.

766
01:11:17,488 --> 01:11:20,469
[SPEAKER_11]: So we do have legal counsel in our team.

767
01:11:21,209 --> 01:11:25,850
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that it would be great for the next meeting that we have that he would also join.

768
01:11:26,010 --> 01:11:30,872
[SPEAKER_11]: And so any questions that people might have, he would be a lot more

769
01:11:32,792 --> 01:11:36,533
[SPEAKER_11]: he will be a lot better to answer the more legal terms.

770
01:11:37,873 --> 01:11:46,495
[SPEAKER_11]: And so, yeah, we will invite him for the next meeting to help answer all of the questions.

771
01:11:50,696 --> 01:11:50,936
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

772
01:11:50,956 --> 01:11:51,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Paola.

773
01:11:51,776 --> 01:11:56,337
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, I will go to Marcela.

774
01:11:56,377 --> 01:11:56,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead.

775
01:11:59,413 --> 01:12:02,175
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, um, I, I apologize.

776
01:12:02,195 --> 01:12:08,579
[SPEAKER_09]: I missed the first part of the presentation, but I wanted to quickly ask about, um, further down in Boston Avenue.

777
01:12:08,619 --> 01:12:14,563
[SPEAKER_09]: There is a building, um, least engineering building that's close to the U hall and whole foods.

778
01:12:15,304 --> 01:12:24,870
[SPEAKER_09]: And, um, I'm just remembering back when I came in 2020 and like, saw this, um, kind of proposal for having, um, I believe the.

779
01:12:25,550 --> 01:12:28,611
[SPEAKER_09]: Station built around or maybe replacing you.

780
01:12:28,651 --> 01:12:38,453
[SPEAKER_09]: I forget the exact details of affordable housing, like building or kind of replacing the whole foods with whole foods on the bottom and just maybe some more development in there.

781
01:12:38,553 --> 01:12:40,813
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I was really excited by all those ideas.

782
01:12:40,933 --> 01:12:48,475
[SPEAKER_09]: And at this point, it kind of feels like when I go down Boston, there's like nothing until I get up to Hillside.

783
01:12:49,555 --> 01:13:09,739
[SPEAKER_09]: But for Weiland, I do wonder if there is any interest in, I don't know if we'd need to wait for a potential of revisiting that station or whether there might be some way to work with Tufts to kind of add more stores there.

784
01:13:09,799 --> 01:13:11,999
[SPEAKER_09]: There's so much parking that they have right in front.

785
01:13:12,479 --> 01:13:15,060
[SPEAKER_09]: It just feels like there's so much that can be done with the spaces.

786
01:13:15,100 --> 01:13:17,400
[SPEAKER_09]: They hosted the library temporarily there too.

787
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:21,302
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um, I'm, I'm just feel like that.

788
01:13:21,522 --> 01:13:33,687
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's not, I guess this isn't technically Tufts probably, but the spot across the river where there's a ramen place, there's like, it feels like the other stores are kind of vacant and just feels to me like such a

789
01:13:34,147 --> 01:14:00,421
[SPEAKER_09]: missed opportunity for more development and I'm just curious in addition to all the zoning I'm not sure if the answer is building up and zoning necessarily maybe it's more of like handling vacancies and stuff but how to you know encourage development in those areas and hopefully encouraging like across the whole way like will help lift up the neighborhood overall.

790
01:14:01,142 --> 01:14:01,322
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

791
01:14:03,562 --> 01:14:04,102
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

792
01:14:05,023 --> 01:14:07,785
[SPEAKER_13]: So to be clear, that's not a Tufts building.

793
01:14:07,986 --> 01:14:12,329
[SPEAKER_13]: Tufts has some offices in that building, but that is owned by Cummings Properties.

794
01:14:12,829 --> 01:14:14,691
[SPEAKER_13]: They've actually come in front of the city.

795
01:14:15,472 --> 01:14:17,914
[SPEAKER_13]: So Cummings, by the way, is a fun nonprofit.

796
01:14:18,054 --> 01:14:23,498
[SPEAKER_13]: All of their profits from their real estate holdings go to charity that they give away in grants.

797
01:14:24,819 --> 01:14:30,804
[SPEAKER_13]: And they do rent to Tufts, and they did rent to the city at a very, very low rate for our library.

798
01:14:31,580 --> 01:14:42,487
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, they have come in front of the city to read about to add additional to that location and they were going to during sort of the height of the pandemic when biotech was really hot.

799
01:14:43,687 --> 01:14:51,532
[SPEAKER_13]: That proposal has still it's still in an approved state, but it's on their back burner right now because of the cost of construction, et cetera.

800
01:14:52,052 --> 01:15:12,642
[SPEAKER_13]: I will say that we pushed them pretty hard to put ground floor businesses there, and they reluctantly had put in, designed that they would put a cafe on the first floor of that facing Boston Ave, and that was the best we could get out of them, because their intention is to keep that parking structure and build on top of it.

801
01:15:13,667 --> 01:15:18,348
[SPEAKER_13]: But this whole area is part of the corridor zoning that we are looking at.

802
01:15:18,448 --> 01:15:28,310
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're looking at Boston Ave and Main Street and the corridors as a separate, not tonight, but we are looking at those, including the area that you're talking about.

803
01:15:29,110 --> 01:15:33,811
[SPEAKER_13]: And that would be the meeting that we're planning.

804
01:15:33,891 --> 01:15:38,732
[SPEAKER_13]: The public Q&A is the one that's going to be in late May of the ones that we've talked about.

805
01:15:39,348 --> 01:15:42,792
[SPEAKER_13]: And it'll it's starting to be in front of the city council.

806
01:15:42,872 --> 01:15:49,739
[SPEAKER_13]: I think next the planning and permitting committee at the next meeting, May 13th, 14th, whatever the Wednesday is.

807
01:15:51,321 --> 01:15:57,167
[SPEAKER_13]: So we are looking at those and that those dilapidated buildings on the corner of Boston Ave and North street.

808
01:15:57,964 --> 01:16:04,007
[SPEAKER_13]: That property owner, we've been working with him very hard for several years to get that property sold and redeveloped.

809
01:16:04,208 --> 01:16:09,210
[SPEAKER_13]: And every single developer we've talked to has agreed that ground floor commercial would make sense there.

810
01:16:10,451 --> 01:16:14,233
[SPEAKER_13]: But he has not accepted any of the offers that he has been made on that property.

811
01:16:16,395 --> 01:16:17,915
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, this is my frustrated face.

812
01:16:24,592 --> 01:16:35,086
[SPEAKER_06]: This this this question comes up a lot it came up last night as well when we were talking about Medford square and West Medford square in the planning and permitting committee this interplay between.

813
01:16:36,408 --> 01:16:44,478
[SPEAKER_06]: mechanisms, regulations, and soft power that the city has around persistently vacant buildings and what we can do about that.

814
01:16:44,598 --> 01:16:47,041
[SPEAKER_06]: It is often outside of the purview of zoning specifically.

815
01:16:48,222 --> 01:16:51,166
[SPEAKER_06]: But obviously, when we're talking about development, it comes up.

816
01:16:51,186 --> 01:16:52,207
[SPEAKER_06]: I thank you for raising that.

817
01:16:52,307 --> 01:16:55,792
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that is, of course, when Alicia, I see you gesturing.

818
01:16:56,585 --> 01:17:03,612
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to and I realized that I missed sort of the part of the key of that was around the T station in the hall.

819
01:17:04,233 --> 01:17:06,295
[SPEAKER_13]: Fun fact that you hall is in Somerville.

820
01:17:06,375 --> 01:17:09,638
[SPEAKER_13]: When you look at Medford maps, there's a weird cut out in that area.

821
01:17:10,699 --> 01:17:13,221
[SPEAKER_13]: But the T station question is a state level 1.

822
01:17:13,962 --> 01:17:21,586
[SPEAKER_13]: At this time, there are some people have concerns about the impact on traffic of a stop at that location.

823
01:17:22,126 --> 01:17:28,769
[SPEAKER_13]: So what the city is pushing for at this time is what would literally be the next steps in development, which would be an environmental study.

824
01:17:29,429 --> 01:17:38,794
[SPEAKER_13]: But before anything would move forward, there's a required environmental study, which would look at, among other things, the traffic at that location.

825
01:17:39,274 --> 01:17:41,435
[SPEAKER_13]: So that is what the city is pushing for at this time.

826
01:17:43,252 --> 01:17:46,274
[SPEAKER_13]: uh, write to your legislators, email the governor.

827
01:17:46,994 --> 01:17:47,875
[SPEAKER_13]: We've tried.

828
01:17:48,775 --> 01:17:50,236
[SPEAKER_13]: That's if you wanted to stop there.

829
01:17:50,256 --> 01:17:57,860
[SPEAKER_13]: But, but if you don't want it, the environmental studies also the thing that would tell us whether or not the traffic should be a concern.

830
01:18:00,221 --> 01:18:00,501
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

831
01:18:01,122 --> 01:18:01,702
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Alicia.

832
01:18:01,722 --> 01:18:03,223
[SPEAKER_06]: And thank you again for the questions, Marcella.

833
01:18:04,724 --> 01:18:04,944
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

834
01:18:05,004 --> 01:18:06,505
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to, um,

835
01:18:07,477 --> 01:18:08,619
[SPEAKER_06]: Keeping an eye on the time, it is 830.

836
01:18:09,239 --> 01:18:16,729
[SPEAKER_06]: I did say I would read more of the Q&A questions that hadn't yet been spoken about, so I'll do that quickly, and then I will hand it back to Paola.

837
01:18:20,447 --> 01:18:26,353
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, in the chat, Daniel shared three-year resident and owner here, and I can't wait to spend many more years here at Medford.

838
01:18:26,393 --> 01:18:41,969
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd love to see Tufts expand, create way more dormitory and lab spaces, spaces so students can start companies and get off their feet, and way more restaurants, small businesses, and such to not only serve the community, but all people who are now commuting daily into the city via the Green Line.

839
01:18:42,890 --> 01:18:48,593
[SPEAKER_06]: If they own the property, they should be able to use it how they want and the surrounding community will thrive as a result.

840
01:18:49,174 --> 01:18:50,414
[SPEAKER_06]: Somerville was the new Cambridge.

841
01:18:50,675 --> 01:18:52,215
[SPEAKER_06]: Medford is the new Somerville.

842
01:18:52,656 --> 01:18:53,696
[SPEAKER_06]: And then a clarification.

843
01:18:54,077 --> 01:18:54,437
[SPEAKER_06]: Get on.

844
01:18:54,757 --> 01:18:55,357
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yes.

845
01:18:55,477 --> 01:18:56,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Get on their feet, not get off their feet.

846
01:18:57,479 --> 01:18:58,479
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a comment from Daniel.

847
01:18:58,919 --> 01:18:59,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Daniel.

848
01:19:02,541 --> 01:19:08,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Another commenter for Ray Doon, I apologize if I'm not pronouncing that correctly, shares

849
01:19:09,273 --> 01:19:12,816
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't want the stretch of College Ave close to the gym anymore building.

850
01:19:13,096 --> 01:19:15,058
[SPEAKER_06]: It is already a traffic jam and saturated.

851
01:19:15,178 --> 01:19:16,159
[SPEAKER_06]: The density is high.

852
01:19:16,699 --> 01:19:19,081
[SPEAKER_06]: At what point is it too congested to stop?

853
01:19:22,724 --> 01:19:25,806
[SPEAKER_06]: Elizabeth shared to Judith's point about including all of Tufts buildings.

854
01:19:26,086 --> 01:19:28,288
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, 200 Boston Ave is another example.

855
01:19:28,929 --> 01:19:32,932
[SPEAKER_06]: It should be talked about in the Tufts district and also in the Boston Ave corridor.

856
01:19:37,411 --> 01:19:40,313
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, going back to Daniel, height is not the only factor.

857
01:19:40,413 --> 01:19:48,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Plenty of the buildings on Powder House Boulevard are tall but are beautiful and are surrounded by well-kept spaces that are a joy to look at and walk past.

858
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:59,688
[SPEAKER_06]: I totally agree a huge imposing building next to a two-story would be silly, so being able to quantify very specifically how far from the property line roofs can be and having green space requirements can make this a win-win.

859
01:20:00,108 --> 01:20:04,151
[SPEAKER_06]: I also forgot to mention earlier, to the point of another commenter,

860
01:20:05,432 --> 01:20:15,280
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we can expect to see context standards, including looking at how abutting buildings of different height, how the shade interplays there.

861
01:20:15,340 --> 01:20:20,004
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been looking at those in our conversations about the zoning proposals for the squares.

862
01:20:20,044 --> 01:20:28,971
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think we can expect to see those as we move forward and get more into the weeds on the Tufts Institutional Zone and Boston Ave corridor zoning as well.

863
01:20:31,453 --> 01:20:33,114
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, just a couple more of these here.

864
01:20:34,115 --> 01:20:39,419
[SPEAKER_06]: Jason shares, I know pre-pandemic Tufts offered various usage of facilities to abutters.

865
01:20:39,959 --> 01:20:54,070
[SPEAKER_06]: I think most of those have come back, such as use of the gym, but is there a way to protect that going forward, possibly included in the zoning somehow, so that the abutters who end up with any added traffic slash hassles can take advantage of the university facilities?

866
01:20:57,020 --> 01:21:05,666
[SPEAKER_06]: And Daniel posed the question, what difference would there be by including the businesses on the east side of Boston Ave versus not including these businesses in the Tufts Institutional Zone?

867
01:21:05,686 --> 01:21:08,348
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a good thing for us to consider as we go forward.

868
01:21:12,752 --> 01:21:12,952
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

869
01:21:13,777 --> 01:21:17,459
[SPEAKER_06]: And I encourage everybody, please continue to review these.

870
01:21:17,980 --> 01:21:22,623
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you see something that you agree with, use the upvote function.

871
01:21:22,723 --> 01:21:31,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, this is not a scientific study, but this data on the opinions that are out in the community is useful for us as we go forward.

872
01:21:34,010 --> 01:21:35,331
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, back to you, Paola.

873
01:21:37,892 --> 01:21:38,653
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

874
01:21:39,393 --> 01:21:40,314
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm going to share

875
01:21:41,683 --> 01:21:43,863
[SPEAKER_11]: The presentation, we can continue.

876
01:21:43,883 --> 01:22:07,648
[SPEAKER_11]: So we did look into Somerville Special District, the Tufts University.

877
01:22:10,135 --> 01:22:12,557
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm going to go, so we did a summary.

878
01:22:12,677 --> 01:22:15,099
[SPEAKER_11]: It is true that it's easy to find.

879
01:22:15,119 --> 01:22:18,643
[SPEAKER_11]: They have PDF, but also a website.

880
01:22:20,024 --> 01:22:23,087
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's quite clear, but easy to read.

881
01:22:23,107 --> 01:22:26,250
[SPEAKER_11]: They are just a couple of pages, but we did a little summary.

882
01:22:27,611 --> 01:22:54,352
[SPEAKER_11]: And so they have an intent and a purpose of why they decided to do a special district for the Tufts University, mainly is to maintain an area of the city for campus of an educational institution, to preserve land areas primarily dedicated to the education services, to reduce the impact of higher intensity educational uses on the surrounding residential properties,

883
01:22:54,952 --> 01:23:03,416
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, and we will see how they did that, and then distribute the coverage and floor area of buildings across the quadrants of this district.

884
01:23:03,436 --> 01:23:08,418
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think this touches a little bit what Jeremy was talking about.

885
01:23:11,190 --> 01:23:24,354
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not exactly on the lot of the development, but what they did is to collect some of those properties and so that you need to take that property into account, not the whole campus.

886
01:23:24,834 --> 01:23:26,994
[SPEAKER_11]: I will explain that a little bit more.

887
01:23:28,555 --> 01:23:30,255
[SPEAKER_11]: Then they have some building standards.

888
01:23:31,115 --> 01:23:36,277
[SPEAKER_11]: They allow multiple principal buildings on each lot.

889
01:23:38,385 --> 01:23:52,472
[SPEAKER_11]: They have some front setbacks and it's 20 feet for certain streets, so College Avenue, Powder House Boulevard and Buckhart Avenue, and 15 feet for Dearborn Road and Curtis Street.

890
01:23:53,653 --> 01:23:57,555
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is interesting for any of those streets that

891
01:23:58,075 --> 01:24:02,416
[SPEAKER_11]: We also have in Medford that we have that continuous front setback.

892
01:24:02,436 --> 01:24:05,057
[SPEAKER_11]: So that will be things that we need to consider.

893
01:24:06,517 --> 01:24:14,959
[SPEAKER_11]: Then for a specific street, they have different setbacks for rear setback and front setback.

894
01:24:15,479 --> 01:24:16,979
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the building height.

895
01:24:17,180 --> 01:24:20,680
[SPEAKER_11]: And so the building heights, what they did is something very interesting that is being used.

896
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:24,721
[SPEAKER_11]: Haven't seen many here in this region, Massachusetts.

897
01:24:25,201 --> 01:24:27,562
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's definitely something that a lot of time

898
01:24:28,103 --> 01:24:35,638
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been used in Europe, for example, where you don't have the heights based on district or based on their use.

899
01:24:36,701 --> 01:24:39,843
[SPEAKER_11]: or in the form-based code by the typology of the building.

900
01:24:40,384 --> 01:24:48,509
[SPEAKER_11]: But you set the height on a map according to the location and how it affects the surrounding areas, right?

901
01:24:49,129 --> 01:24:52,651
[SPEAKER_11]: So what they did is basically to have different color bands.

902
01:24:54,232 --> 01:24:59,876
[SPEAKER_11]: So all along the residential areas, they designated this blue band.

903
01:24:59,916 --> 01:25:04,639
[SPEAKER_11]: This is 100 feet offset or width of this band.

904
01:25:05,299 --> 01:25:07,620
[SPEAKER_11]: and they allow two and a half stories.

905
01:25:08,180 --> 01:25:10,861
[SPEAKER_11]: Then in the next red band, they allow four stories.

906
01:25:11,881 --> 01:25:25,266
[SPEAKER_11]: In the yellow band, and it's only the western corner, they allowed, this is 150 width band, and they allow eight, sorry, six.

907
01:25:25,626 --> 01:25:27,447
[SPEAKER_11]: And then on the green, they allow this eight.

908
01:25:29,070 --> 01:25:30,451
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that is very important.

909
01:25:30,471 --> 01:25:34,174
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that it was Jeremy as well, and that he's talked about that.

910
01:25:34,234 --> 01:25:37,337
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, other people mentioned this, but how

911
01:25:38,070 --> 01:25:41,411
[SPEAKER_11]: we deal with the hill, we have some topography in Medford.

912
01:25:41,831 --> 01:25:50,173
[SPEAKER_11]: So towards Boston Avenue, whatever we do at the very end of the, at the very top of the hill will really affect.

913
01:25:51,013 --> 01:26:07,357
[SPEAKER_11]: So maybe these bends needs, if we want to use this strategy, the bends will need to be adjusted in the Medford area, taking into account with some sections that how that hill will affect, especially for daylight.

914
01:26:08,698 --> 01:26:14,824
[SPEAKER_11]: And then they have this building massing and this is what I was talking about this, what they call measuring parcel.

915
01:26:15,305 --> 01:26:21,312
[SPEAKER_11]: And so what they do is that they combine different.

916
01:26:24,580 --> 01:26:42,267
[SPEAKER_11]: parcels, different lots, and what they say is like, for example, this one and these are MP3, and so the impacts of the maximum lot coverage, maximum floor area ratio, what they have to

917
01:26:43,087 --> 01:26:45,589
[SPEAKER_11]: in that, within that development site.

918
01:26:47,210 --> 01:26:58,256
[SPEAKER_11]: You cannot take into account something that you're doing in an MP3 area, you cannot take MP1 into account for your 65% or ratio, right?

919
01:26:58,576 --> 01:27:11,024
[SPEAKER_11]: So you, and they do this to have a balance and to have a density that is more equal and around the whole campus and not only being too intense in one area.

920
01:27:12,296 --> 01:27:16,901
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, the maximum lead coverage is 65%, maximum floor area ratio.

921
01:27:17,342 --> 01:27:24,009
[SPEAKER_11]: We do not have floor area ratio in Medford, so we work, this is about the density, how much density you allow.

922
01:27:25,533 --> 01:27:36,719
[SPEAKER_11]: And so they give you the height, and so you need to balance that maximum square footage with those ratios and that height.

923
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:40,241
[SPEAKER_11]: And then they ask for a maximum floor plate.

924
01:27:40,602 --> 01:27:45,584
[SPEAKER_11]: So the maximum area in the ground floor per building is 15,000.

925
01:27:47,285 --> 01:27:49,867
[SPEAKER_11]: So this would be a way to address those issues.

926
01:27:51,573 --> 01:28:07,911
[SPEAKER_11]: then what are the permitted uses is basically educational service as a principal use and then all the accessory services that are directly needed and that the Tufts University consider that it's important for their

927
01:28:08,752 --> 01:28:12,295
[SPEAKER_11]: faculty, staff, students and visitors needs.

928
01:28:13,335 --> 01:28:22,002
[SPEAKER_11]: Parking is as well established and administered the permit program by Tufts and they do have some requirements.

929
01:28:22,062 --> 01:28:33,730
[SPEAKER_11]: So they have here the requirements, it depends on how many faculty they have with the students and then some non-campus students and then others like visitors.

930
01:28:34,970 --> 01:28:43,093
[SPEAKER_11]: They would have to, with those numbers, have some multipliers and then would have those numbers.

931
01:28:43,673 --> 01:28:53,697
[SPEAKER_11]: They also have the space location, so they need to have at least a minimum of those parkings for certain areas in those designated locations.

932
01:28:55,478 --> 01:29:02,040
[SPEAKER_11]: These can be reviewed, so if some of these parking regulations, those numbers change,

933
01:29:02,598 --> 01:29:12,240
[SPEAKER_11]: they can review it and they can have some reduction of up to 25%, but then they need to review these numbers.

934
01:29:13,420 --> 01:29:16,581
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think it's every three years they could review it.

935
01:29:18,241 --> 01:29:20,482
[SPEAKER_11]: So that is about Somerville.

936
01:29:20,802 --> 01:29:30,764
[SPEAKER_11]: What we just did is, and it's not a draft, this is not a proposal, but we were just taking that idea of making it

937
01:29:31,868 --> 01:29:39,491
[SPEAKER_11]: that height map and continue what they have at this moment.

938
01:29:39,691 --> 01:29:41,291
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is not a proposal.

939
01:29:41,331 --> 01:29:42,772
[SPEAKER_11]: We do need to study this.

940
01:29:43,832 --> 01:29:59,857
[SPEAKER_11]: This is not something that we are proposing, especially because, as everyone has mentioned about the hill and the areas that some areas might have, they are able to have more height because there is enough space.

941
01:30:01,598 --> 01:30:05,741
[SPEAKER_11]: and others are really looking into the residential neighborhoods.

942
01:30:07,202 --> 01:30:13,107
[SPEAKER_11]: So we will need to continue to work on a proposal.

943
01:30:13,627 --> 01:30:18,291
[SPEAKER_11]: But let's say that it could be based on this idea of the height map.

944
01:30:18,711 --> 01:30:23,915
[SPEAKER_11]: And so we will have these bands and place them accordingly to where we think

945
01:30:24,515 --> 01:30:25,756
[SPEAKER_11]: these heights should work.

946
01:30:25,916 --> 01:30:29,539
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's not by a district, but it works more as a height map.

947
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:36,785
[SPEAKER_11]: So we define better where we want those higher density and lower density.

948
01:30:39,373 --> 01:30:51,058
[SPEAKER_11]: And then as well with the front setbacks, we could, at this point, what we have is those 20 feet for the College Avenue, so that we could also extend that.

949
01:30:52,238 --> 01:30:57,120
[SPEAKER_11]: Also Park Avenue and then 15 for Curtis.

950
01:30:57,661 --> 01:31:00,802
[SPEAKER_11]: So this would be a way to connect the

951
01:31:01,502 --> 01:31:13,148
[SPEAKER_11]: Somerville campus, some of those regulations into our area and then modified it where we think it's needed.

952
01:31:15,089 --> 01:31:17,971
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, I'm going to stop now sharing.

953
01:31:18,011 --> 01:31:20,572
[SPEAKER_11]: Now the boundaries, we will look into it.

954
01:31:20,732 --> 01:31:21,873
[SPEAKER_11]: I've heard somebody said

955
01:31:22,424 --> 01:31:26,687
[SPEAKER_11]: that the TE stations shouldn't be involved in this.

956
01:31:26,787 --> 01:31:30,770
[SPEAKER_11]: So we could have these two islands, the north part and the south part.

957
01:31:32,031 --> 01:31:33,932
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a possibility.

958
01:31:34,612 --> 01:31:45,840
[SPEAKER_11]: Even though it's not owned by Medford, by the university, so they wouldn't be able to do anything that's public property.

959
01:31:46,841 --> 01:31:49,242
[SPEAKER_11]: But in any case, we could separate them

960
01:31:51,364 --> 01:31:57,310
[SPEAKER_11]: and work a little bit better on that proposal for the boundary.

961
01:32:05,497 --> 01:32:15,930
[SPEAKER_06]: And you just said it a minute ago, but I'll just emphasize, because I know that we're looking at a lot on the screen, the maps that you show that you just showed at the end of the Medford side of campus.

962
01:32:15,970 --> 01:32:18,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, that is not a proposal that we're putting forward at this time.

963
01:32:18,673 --> 01:32:21,957
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just a kind of a kind of a thought experiment of if.

964
01:32:22,998 --> 01:32:39,217
[SPEAKER_06]: um that strategy that Somerville employs was continued on our side of the campus what that might look like um what we are interested in hearing from folks tonight and also after tonight as people continue to process and digest is um

965
01:32:39,697 --> 01:32:58,312
[SPEAKER_06]: your responses to this kind of first look at Somerville's strategy in their institutional zone, what you like, what you don't like, your concerns, your questions, what you'd like the planning and permitting committee and zoning consultant to be thinking about as we go forward.

966
01:32:58,332 --> 01:32:59,392
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that there's a

967
01:33:00,715 --> 01:33:08,540
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that we're advantaged by having a strategy on the other side of the city line to look at, and we're curious to hear from you your reactions to that.

968
01:33:08,941 --> 01:33:13,264
[SPEAKER_06]: So please, again, as always, feel free to raise your hand or keep using the Q&A.

969
01:33:14,765 --> 01:33:16,065
[SPEAKER_06]: We will go first to Judith.

970
01:33:16,085 --> 01:33:16,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead.

971
01:33:20,245 --> 01:33:27,492
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I mean, I have looked at that proposal the only and the only comments that I can make about it is number one.

972
01:33:27,532 --> 01:33:32,777
[SPEAKER_15]: What happens in Somerville with properties that are not included in that zone?

973
01:33:32,817 --> 01:33:33,958
[SPEAKER_15]: How have they managed those?

974
01:33:34,018 --> 01:33:34,839
[SPEAKER_15]: Because obviously.

975
01:33:35,780 --> 01:33:51,400
[SPEAKER_15]: Medford has properties of Tufts that are living currently in a residential area that would currently not be zoned as a peak maybe as a pt2 So I guess the question is for Somerville when you meet with them is how they handled this sort of more off-site?

976
01:33:52,542 --> 01:33:52,622
[SPEAKER_15]: um

977
01:33:54,258 --> 01:33:55,979
[SPEAKER_15]: buildings that Tufts has?

978
01:33:55,999 --> 01:34:04,223
[SPEAKER_15]: And is there like a footnote that says, Oh, and by the way, this also applies to these properties, you know, in different areas that Tufts owns.

979
01:34:05,464 --> 01:34:11,808
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it would be interesting when you do meet with the city and Tufts could tell you this, but I don't know if they would do that.

980
01:34:12,668 --> 01:34:21,193
[SPEAKER_15]: It would be interesting to find out from the city how much pushback they've ever gotten from Tufts on this proposed on what currently exists on paper.

981
01:34:21,213 --> 01:34:21,753
[SPEAKER_15]: In other words,

982
01:34:22,238 --> 01:34:31,000
[SPEAKER_15]: people were saying that, okay, we can set the standard, the dimensional standard, but that Tufts can still request, you know, an addition.

983
01:34:31,561 --> 01:34:38,302
[SPEAKER_15]: So by special permitting, you know, an addition to that dimensional standard.

984
01:34:38,943 --> 01:34:48,025
[SPEAKER_15]: And it would be interesting to know how many times not not necessarily for me, but I mean, for you guys, how many times the Tufts has pushed back and succeeded.

985
01:34:48,626 --> 01:34:51,730
[SPEAKER_15]: with Somerville on some of those dimensional standards.

986
01:34:52,150 --> 01:34:57,918
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the people in the chat, the comments, sort of said something about, you know, they have plenty of really tall buildings on Powder House.

987
01:34:58,219 --> 01:34:59,200
[SPEAKER_15]: They actually don't.

988
01:34:59,861 --> 01:35:03,105
[SPEAKER_15]: And because they can't, right?

989
01:35:03,126 --> 01:35:04,347
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, that's what we just saw.

990
01:35:05,028 --> 01:35:24,263
[SPEAKER_15]: The only other thing I'll say is I do think that the distance markers is specifically for the Boston Avenue properties for like the hillside need to be looked at really carefully in the proposal, whatever it ultimately ends up to be so that we don't max out on distance from whatever the perimeter line for the campuses and thereby.

991
01:35:25,670 --> 01:35:33,397
[SPEAKER_15]: don't get to have that standard applied, say, in this case, to Brookings or to Sunset or to Burgett.

992
01:35:34,137 --> 01:35:34,978
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's all.

993
01:35:41,824 --> 01:35:42,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

994
01:35:42,444 --> 01:35:43,926
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much, Judith, for your comments.

995
01:35:45,807 --> 01:35:47,969
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, go next to John.

996
01:35:48,550 --> 01:35:49,010
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead, John.

997
01:35:52,280 --> 01:35:54,521
[SPEAKER_12]: Paula and Kit, this has been a great meeting.

998
01:35:54,901 --> 01:35:58,922
[SPEAKER_12]: And all the meetings I've been to, I've never got a chance to talk, and now I'm talking twice.

999
01:35:59,742 --> 01:36:03,103
[SPEAKER_12]: But one thing I would like to say, I'm going to take advantage of this.

1000
01:36:03,863 --> 01:36:13,126
[SPEAKER_12]: But I would say one thing, because I mentioned, I heard that mentioned about extending those requirements down College Ave, where I live at 94 College Ave.

1001
01:36:13,606 --> 01:36:20,968
[SPEAKER_12]: I would just be a little careful about that, because I don't think the density, when I think of Somerville, and by the way,

1002
01:36:21,621 --> 01:36:27,726
[SPEAKER_12]: I've lived in this area for over like 60 years, and I lived on Curtis Street at one time.

1003
01:36:28,086 --> 01:36:29,587
[SPEAKER_12]: I lived on Frederick Ave.

1004
01:36:30,248 --> 01:36:32,490
[SPEAKER_12]: I went to the Somerville schools.

1005
01:36:32,570 --> 01:36:37,193
[SPEAKER_12]: I went to the Lauren L. Dame School, which is now that George Street School.

1006
01:36:37,694 --> 01:36:46,861
[SPEAKER_12]: But the thing I just be careful of, I think the density in Somerville, I think at one time is they had the most people per square foot than anybody in the country.

1007
01:36:47,507 --> 01:36:57,835
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just be careful, because I think their density is a little bit more congested when it comes to residential areas than the Memphis side.

1008
01:36:57,915 --> 01:36:59,337
[SPEAKER_12]: And just be aware of that.

1009
01:37:00,477 --> 01:37:03,200
[SPEAKER_12]: There's not very many single family homes in Somerville.

1010
01:37:03,860 --> 01:37:12,187
[SPEAKER_12]: But where I live in those areas of Pearl, Frederick, Stanley, there is a number of single family homes.

1011
01:37:12,207 --> 01:37:14,048
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think the density is a little bit different.

1012
01:37:14,068 --> 01:37:14,989
[SPEAKER_12]: And just be aware of that.

1013
01:37:15,590 --> 01:37:15,910
[SPEAKER_12]: That's all.

1014
01:37:18,261 --> 01:37:18,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

1015
01:37:19,221 --> 01:37:19,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, John.

1016
01:37:23,844 --> 01:37:31,027
[SPEAKER_06]: We hope that everybody who's getting a taste of public participation at this meeting will join us at our many upcoming zoning meetings as well.

1017
01:37:31,047 --> 01:37:33,248
[SPEAKER_06]: They are frequently long, but there's always public comment.

1018
01:37:36,070 --> 01:37:36,410
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

1019
01:37:38,831 --> 01:37:40,552
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to go back to the

1020
01:37:43,752 --> 01:37:44,593
[SPEAKER_06]: Q&A.

1021
01:37:44,613 --> 01:37:49,056
[SPEAKER_06]: I see a Jeremy making a similar point as Judith did.

1022
01:37:49,116 --> 01:37:52,979
[SPEAKER_06]: Height maps need to consider that Medford is on the north side of the campus and Somerville is on the south.

1023
01:37:53,780 --> 01:37:56,322
[SPEAKER_06]: These sun and shadow implications are inverted.

1024
01:37:58,150 --> 01:38:06,058
[SPEAKER_06]: crystal notes for anyone interested in the shadows throughout the year, which I don't think should dictate decisions, but it's informative.

1025
01:38:06,098 --> 01:38:11,944
[SPEAKER_06]: You can also take a look at www.suncalc.org.

1026
01:38:14,447 --> 01:38:17,550
[SPEAKER_06]: And then another comment about Somerville's density.

1027
01:38:18,671 --> 01:38:19,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for your comments, everybody.

1028
01:38:23,610 --> 01:38:26,813
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, is there anybody else who has a question?

1029
01:38:27,334 --> 01:38:33,299
[SPEAKER_13]: There were a few things that I sort of answered in the chat and then so that they're showing in the answer tab.

1030
01:38:33,339 --> 01:38:40,366
[SPEAKER_13]: But I did want to flag one is that some people are having, you know, would really like to see more of the maps and they're hard to see on the screens.

1031
01:38:40,426 --> 01:38:41,347
[SPEAKER_13]: And we understand that.

1032
01:38:42,148 --> 01:38:46,652
[SPEAKER_13]: So one of the things that the consultants are working on for us is a mapping tool.

1033
01:38:47,235 --> 01:38:51,237
[SPEAKER_13]: That we're hopeful in the next week or 2 to be able to release to the public.

1034
01:38:51,277 --> 01:38:52,858
[SPEAKER_13]: We need it to work correctly.

1035
01:38:52,918 --> 01:39:00,323
[SPEAKER_13]: And to be clear, that'll be like a tool where people can type in their address and click on it and see information.

1036
01:39:01,303 --> 01:39:04,245
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of the requests were about the specific maps.

1037
01:39:05,065 --> 01:39:23,718
[SPEAKER_13]: So we will have the presentation from tonight, and I think actually, Paola, that map where we kind of outlined the potential Tufts campus, if we could literally label it potential Tufts zone, and maybe with some of the edits that we talked about before the meeting started, so it might not come up beyond.

1038
01:39:23,738 --> 01:39:31,343
[SPEAKER_13]: I wouldn't expect it to be on our website until next Monday, because we have asked her to sort of change the line a little bit to follow Boston Ave.

1039
01:39:32,323 --> 01:39:40,128
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that the commercial buildings between Boston and the railroad track should not be in this zone, but should be in a mixed use zone.

1040
01:39:41,949 --> 01:39:44,371
[SPEAKER_13]: But that is 1 of the things that we're putting out there.

1041
01:39:44,411 --> 01:39:48,073
[SPEAKER_13]: So we will post it next week for people to then send us comments on and.

1042
01:39:51,120 --> 01:39:59,963
[SPEAKER_13]: While so the tool that the consultants are working on will not include ownership information for privacy reasons for the general public.

1043
01:40:00,703 --> 01:40:15,068
[SPEAKER_13]: We're also looking at just putting together a map of the property that Topps owns and that Walnut Hill owns and whether that's something that Paola's team can do for us or whether we should ask our GIS coordinator or who can get that out first.

1044
01:40:16,020 --> 01:40:19,665
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, we will also be putting something like that together as well.

1045
01:40:20,086 --> 01:40:23,951
[SPEAKER_13]: It's clearly something that they need to put together some draft zoning.

1046
01:40:26,594 --> 01:40:27,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, thank you for that.

1047
01:40:27,375 --> 01:40:27,676
[SPEAKER_06]: Alicia.

1048
01:40:29,869 --> 01:40:32,291
[SPEAKER_06]: excited to have the new GIS tool roll out.

1049
01:40:32,311 --> 01:40:34,552
[SPEAKER_06]: I think a lot of people will find it really useful.

1050
01:40:34,572 --> 01:40:36,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you to Ennis for putting that together for us.

1051
01:40:37,634 --> 01:40:49,061
[SPEAKER_06]: And while we're waiting on that, in the meantime, the presentation slides that we've looked at tonight, pending the capacity of the city's communications department, those should be up on the city's zoning site by tomorrow.

1052
01:40:49,081 --> 01:40:53,924
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can at least look at the maps and slides that were shared tonight, and you can download them and zoom in.

1053
01:40:56,413 --> 01:41:00,814
[SPEAKER_06]: So for folks who are looking for them on the zoning page this evening and couldn't find them, you're not missing anything.

1054
01:41:00,854 --> 01:41:02,775
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not there yet, but they probably will be tomorrow.

1055
01:41:06,916 --> 01:41:12,577
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, any additional burning questions or comments from folks at this time?

1056
01:41:12,617 --> 01:41:22,900
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll reiterate, our inboxes are always open to more comments or questions that folks have after meetings, in between meetings, at any time.

1057
01:41:28,425 --> 01:41:38,654
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, seeing none, I'm just going to do a quick recap of upcoming zoning meeting dates.

1058
01:41:38,734 --> 01:41:46,942
[SPEAKER_06]: So all of these will be findable on the, all of these are findable on the city's zoning website.

1059
01:41:49,114 --> 01:42:00,049
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a couple meetings coming up on other topics in the comprehensive zoning review, so please do check out the web page and see if there's something that you want to be involved in.

1060
01:42:01,311 --> 01:42:05,056
[SPEAKER_06]: We mentioned the other corridors zoning topic this evening.

1061
01:42:05,537 --> 01:42:10,641
[SPEAKER_06]: that other parts of, um, further flung parts of Boston Ave might be incorporated in.

1062
01:42:11,362 --> 01:42:18,787
[SPEAKER_06]: That will be, um, that will be before the city's, the city council's planning and permitting committee for the first time on May 14th.

1063
01:42:18,827 --> 01:42:21,229
[SPEAKER_06]: That'll be our preliminary meeting on that topic.

1064
01:42:22,230 --> 01:42:23,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, please feel free to join.

1065
01:42:23,871 --> 01:42:31,878
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and then we expect to have the public Q&A on that zoning topic on May 29th.

1066
01:42:34,592 --> 01:42:43,414
[SPEAKER_06]: So please feel free to save those dates and this information is available on the city's own web page so you can reference that and all Zoom links are always available on the city's online events calendar.

1067
01:42:48,876 --> 01:42:50,376
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything else?

1068
01:42:50,836 --> 01:42:55,477
[SPEAKER_06]: Go back to Jeremy and then I'll go back to Paola and city planning staff to close us out.

1069
01:42:57,038 --> 01:42:57,578
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead, Jeremy.

1070
01:42:58,208 --> 01:42:58,748
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Kit.

1071
01:42:59,189 --> 01:43:09,896
[SPEAKER_00]: Just curious, do you or the city staff have a sense of when the next conversation about the Tufts institutional zone may be coming up, you know, ballpark?

1072
01:43:10,256 --> 01:43:10,977
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we a month out?

1073
01:43:11,017 --> 01:43:13,118
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we a couple weeks out?

1074
01:43:13,298 --> 01:43:15,119
[SPEAKER_00]: Just give us a sense of that, please.

1075
01:43:18,065 --> 01:43:27,907
[SPEAKER_13]: And I guess this is a great question just because we then want we want to give this information to power and her team to sort of draft some recommendation.

1076
01:43:28,607 --> 01:43:35,108
[SPEAKER_13]: And then when they are ready to float that they'll 1st, we do have working group meetings weekly during the week.

1077
01:43:36,068 --> 01:43:37,989
[SPEAKER_13]: And so the working group will take a look at it.

1078
01:43:38,109 --> 01:43:43,830
[SPEAKER_13]: And when we, we think it's kind of ready enough, then it goes to the planning and zoning committee.

1079
01:43:46,762 --> 01:43:53,824
[SPEAKER_13]: And so not May 14th, I think that's too soon, just because we've got other stuff that's going to be there.

1080
01:43:53,884 --> 01:43:57,645
[SPEAKER_13]: So it would be at least two weeks after that would be the next one.

1081
01:43:57,665 --> 01:44:02,086
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm just giving you that as the earliest possible.

1082
01:44:03,427 --> 01:44:07,808
[SPEAKER_13]: We've got a lot on our plates right now, and we're trying to get it all done in the next two months.

1083
01:44:09,565 --> 01:44:13,207
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I think the earliest would be May 28th.

1084
01:44:14,348 --> 01:44:18,690
[SPEAKER_11]: So we will be having the other corridors on May 14th.

1085
01:44:19,850 --> 01:44:29,715
[SPEAKER_11]: So I can imagine that we could, with the second revision of the other corridors, bring also this one.

1086
01:44:30,676 --> 01:44:34,698
[SPEAKER_11]: In any case, we will be doing these updates.

1087
01:44:35,338 --> 01:44:36,519
[SPEAKER_11]: So it will be on May 28th or June 11th.

1088
01:44:39,099 --> 01:44:45,504
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be, I know it's a little bit too much, but we have so many other topics.

1089
01:44:47,245 --> 01:44:49,367
[SPEAKER_11]: But we will try May 28th.

1090
01:44:50,207 --> 01:44:51,729
[SPEAKER_11]: We will try to do it then.

1091
01:44:51,989 --> 01:44:55,191
[SPEAKER_11]: Otherwise, June 11th, and we will keep updating.

1092
01:44:57,393 --> 01:45:02,677
[SPEAKER_13]: It's my expectation that we wouldn't do a separate standalone Q&A like this.

1093
01:45:03,281 --> 01:45:08,804
[SPEAKER_13]: but rather it would be part of either the, so, and so, you know, those planning and permitting meetings are all hybrid.

1094
01:45:08,964 --> 01:45:14,167
[SPEAKER_13]: You can come in person or you can watch them on Zoom and the city council has been taking questions.

1095
01:45:14,668 --> 01:45:17,269
[SPEAKER_13]: They do tend to run about two, two and a half hours each.

1096
01:45:19,210 --> 01:45:32,838
[SPEAKER_13]: But I would recommend that people who are concerned about Boston Ave and this tucked area, honestly, you want to come to both of those planning and permitting meetings because of the, that we'll be addressing the Boston Ave on the May 11th meeting.

1097
01:45:34,176 --> 01:45:35,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, I'll just second what Alicia said.

1098
01:45:35,659 --> 01:45:41,490
[SPEAKER_06]: I think for folks who are interested in the area overall, May 14th is a great one to attend.

1099
01:45:41,530 --> 01:45:44,336
[SPEAKER_06]: That'll be kind of like broader context we're going to be talking about.

1100
01:45:44,356 --> 01:45:45,538
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what you said.

1101
01:45:46,323 --> 01:45:51,666
[SPEAKER_06]: other corridors, Boston Ave, Main Street as well, potentially the West side of High Street.

1102
01:45:51,746 --> 01:45:55,568
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll also be for folks who haven't attended a lot of the committee meetings.

1103
01:45:55,668 --> 01:46:00,391
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a great way to kind of get familiar with the vocabulary that we use when we're talking about zoning.

1104
01:46:01,252 --> 01:46:07,615
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we will strive to bring a first draft of the Tufts institutional zoning for May 28.

1105
01:46:08,496 --> 01:46:13,038
[SPEAKER_06]: We will be posting updates about the cadence of the zoning topics and the schedule.

1106
01:46:13,118 --> 01:46:15,320
[SPEAKER_06]: We mentioned that at the beginning of every planning and permitting,

1107
01:46:15,820 --> 01:46:18,923
[SPEAKER_06]: Committee meeting and we'll update that on the website as well.

1108
01:46:18,943 --> 01:46:30,554
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to make sure that the next time we talk about this at a public meeting, we have something that is substantial for counselors and members of the public to respond to.

1109
01:46:31,455 --> 01:46:34,978
[SPEAKER_06]: So this has been great source material as we go about this process.

1110
01:46:34,998 --> 01:46:35,959
[SPEAKER_06]: So we take next steps.

1111
01:46:35,999 --> 01:46:37,381
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you all so much for being here.

1112
01:46:38,301 --> 01:46:44,602
[SPEAKER_06]: and for putting your concerns, your comments, your preferences, and your questions on the record at this point.

1113
01:46:44,622 --> 01:46:45,943
[SPEAKER_06]: This is really helpful for us.

1114
01:46:46,483 --> 01:46:56,825
[SPEAKER_06]: And because this is really a special case, this institutional zone, we wanted to do this before we had Emily and Paola start drafting anything too specific.

1115
01:46:57,205 --> 01:47:00,046
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you all for being here and for helping this process.

1116
01:47:02,086 --> 01:47:06,687
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything else to add from Alicia, Danielle,

1117
01:47:07,603 --> 01:47:08,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Paola or Emily.

1118
01:47:12,685 --> 01:47:12,925
[SPEAKER_06]: Good.

1119
01:47:14,566 --> 01:47:16,587
[SPEAKER_13]: Can't stay awake another five minutes, so.

1120
01:47:17,247 --> 01:47:18,468
[SPEAKER_06]: Close it out then.

1121
01:47:18,488 --> 01:47:18,868
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1122
01:47:18,908 --> 01:47:20,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you everybody for being with us.

1123
01:47:21,089 --> 01:47:25,191
[SPEAKER_06]: And like we've said before, any other comments or questions, you can always reach out via email.

1124
01:47:27,051 --> 01:47:27,532
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1125
01:47:27,852 --> 01:47:28,372
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you all.
