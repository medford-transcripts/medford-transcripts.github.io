36
00:02:39,839 --> 00:02:41,499
[SPEAKER_08]: Administrations fundraiser held at the Ford

00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:12,552
[SPEAKER_08]: No, we vote on it later in the meeting.

38
00:03:13,573 --> 00:03:21,460
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm gonna just, I'm going to get to the point because all of this is just way too much.

39
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,921
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just unbelievable.

40
00:03:22,941 --> 00:03:26,064
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you guys all get the packet I gave you?

41
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,367
[SPEAKER_02]: I want you to look at page one, please.

42
00:03:30,488 --> 00:03:34,972
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is all non-union personnel that's allowed to get raises.

43
00:03:36,345 --> 00:03:45,914
[SPEAKER_02]: We asked at the very beginning when we started negotiations over a year ago, we started out with 5.5 and we weren't worth it.

44
00:03:46,955 --> 00:03:48,817
[SPEAKER_02]: So she said, the only thing we're gonna get is 2%.

45
00:03:49,858 --> 00:03:50,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's getting 2%.

46
00:03:52,381 --> 00:03:54,903
[SPEAKER_02]: If you please look at page one, chief of staff, 8.33%.

47
00:03:55,383 --> 00:03:56,084
[SPEAKER_02]: Director of communications, 10.38.

48
00:04:02,162 --> 00:04:06,569
[SPEAKER_02]: director of executive assistant 7.85.

49
00:04:08,431 --> 00:04:10,935
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to get to page two because this is important.

50
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:13,830
[SPEAKER_02]: the elections personnel summary chat.

51
00:04:14,951 --> 00:04:20,355
[SPEAKER_02]: If you notice the election manager is getting 14.15% raise.

52
00:04:21,896 --> 00:04:23,798
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never heard of anything like that.

53
00:04:24,358 --> 00:04:36,547
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the same time, if you remember, she was here a couple of weeks ago during one of the budget meetings, and she wanted to change one of the full time positions into a part time position.

54
00:04:37,731 --> 00:04:42,032
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it got too busy, they would put it back to full time.

55
00:04:42,612 --> 00:04:46,053
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't do that with a union position, that has to be negotiated.

56
00:04:46,874 --> 00:04:50,375
[SPEAKER_02]: When she got hired, she got more money than the previous manager.

57
00:04:51,155 --> 00:04:58,137
[SPEAKER_02]: So according to them, when she got more money, they dissolved another clerk position so she could get paid.

58
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:03,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me, that's a union position that needs to be negotiated.

59
00:05:03,878 --> 00:05:05,179
[SPEAKER_02]: Does everybody understand that?

60
00:05:05,979 --> 00:05:11,921
[SPEAKER_02]: Does everybody understand that slowly but surely, she's trying to get rid of the union?

61
00:05:11,941 --> 00:05:14,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that that is not right.

62
00:05:14,942 --> 00:05:16,223
[SPEAKER_02]: That is not okay.

63
00:05:18,523 --> 00:05:23,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you can go through all of these pages I gave you all the percentages that everybody is getting.

64
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:31,648
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to go back to DPW for the second page six, please.

65
00:05:34,224 --> 00:05:38,627
[SPEAKER_02]: presented the Commissioner 8.43%.

66
00:05:39,307 --> 00:05:41,308
[SPEAKER_02]: I went through the whole list here.

67
00:05:42,049 --> 00:05:47,412
[SPEAKER_02]: And I noticed that the head clerk, which is a union position yet again, is missing.

68
00:05:48,433 --> 00:05:52,575
[SPEAKER_02]: The new position is now called the DPW director admin.

69
00:05:54,056 --> 00:05:59,620
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they had, if I recall correctly, during one of the meetings, they wanted that they wanted to get rid of

70
00:06:00,711 --> 00:06:02,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, last year, okay.

71
00:06:02,332 --> 00:06:08,636
[SPEAKER_02]: They wanted to get rid of the office manager and promote her and give her a $20,000 raise.

72
00:06:09,276 --> 00:06:11,677
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine and dandy, but what about us?

73
00:06:12,378 --> 00:06:15,219
[SPEAKER_02]: So now it's gone, her title is gone.

74
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:21,323
[SPEAKER_02]: She has gotten a obviously a promotion with her new title.

75
00:06:22,363 --> 00:06:26,066
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also noticed that there's only one other

76
00:06:27,006 --> 00:06:29,008
[SPEAKER_02]: there's one clerk position missing.

77
00:06:29,028 --> 00:06:36,295
[SPEAKER_02]: There was supposed to be a senior clerk, a principal clerk, and the office manager.

78
00:06:36,635 --> 00:06:40,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, when I went through all of these, there's one head clerk.

79
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:43,182
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's it.

80
00:06:45,788 --> 00:06:47,590
[SPEAKER_02]: So what happened to these union positions?

81
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:50,492
[SPEAKER_02]: How is this allowed time and time again?

82
00:06:51,073 --> 00:06:51,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Can anybody answer me?

83
00:06:52,034 --> 00:06:56,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Can anybody look me in the eye and tell me that- These are mandatory topics of bargaining, correct?

84
00:06:56,638 --> 00:06:57,078
[SPEAKER_32]: Excuse me?

85
00:06:57,098 --> 00:06:58,920
[SPEAKER_32]: These are mandatory topics of bargaining, correct?

86
00:06:59,761 --> 00:07:00,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

87
00:07:00,301 --> 00:07:02,163
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, so you guys should be taking care of this at the table.

88
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:06,222
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we don't even know about this until we see this paperwork.

89
00:07:06,842 --> 00:07:08,502
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know any of this was going on.

90
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:11,182
[SPEAKER_32]: You guys need to enact your rights.

91
00:07:11,343 --> 00:07:12,683
[SPEAKER_32]: I mean, you know what I mean?

92
00:07:12,703 --> 00:07:15,063
[SPEAKER_32]: You have rights under the- I don't get it, though.

93
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:17,164
[SPEAKER_02]: You people are supposed to be for us.

94
00:07:17,184 --> 00:07:18,104
[SPEAKER_02]: What is going on?

95
00:07:18,164 --> 00:07:18,764
[SPEAKER_32]: Amy, time out here.

96
00:07:18,944 --> 00:07:19,384
[SPEAKER_32]: Time out here.

97
00:07:19,444 --> 00:07:20,244
[SPEAKER_32]: We're not the administration.

98
00:07:20,264 --> 00:07:21,324
[SPEAKER_32]: We don't negotiate contracts.

99
00:07:21,344 --> 00:07:22,985
[SPEAKER_32]: That's the job of the chief of staff per ordinance.

100
00:07:23,605 --> 00:07:26,085
[SPEAKER_32]: All right, now, I haven't seen the chief of staff in a contract negotiation.

101
00:07:26,105 --> 00:07:26,945
[SPEAKER_32]: That's a whole different story.

102
00:07:26,985 --> 00:07:28,006
[SPEAKER_32]: We have KP Law doing that.

103
00:07:28,466 --> 00:07:29,926
[SPEAKER_16]: Point of information, Councilor Knight.

104
00:07:30,606 --> 00:07:38,215
[SPEAKER_16]: I think what Amy's talking about is these positions were all voted by members of this council, not unanimously, but it was voted by members of this group.

105
00:07:38,235 --> 00:07:39,036
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what she's saying.

106
00:07:39,096 --> 00:07:40,278
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, I agree with you there.

107
00:07:41,059 --> 00:07:42,721
[SPEAKER_32]: But these are mandatory topics of bargaining.

108
00:07:42,741 --> 00:07:49,649
[SPEAKER_32]: So when the administration is, you know, depleting the number of membership, the number of

109
00:07:50,754 --> 00:07:53,196
[SPEAKER_32]: employees that are in the membership, you have to look at the work that's being performed.

110
00:07:53,696 --> 00:07:58,359
[SPEAKER_32]: And if the work that's being performed by an employee that's actually union workers, not in the union, they didn't bring the city up on charges.

111
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:05,603
[SPEAKER_32]: You know, we've seen time and time again in this community, the level of respect that's given to organized labor by this administration.

112
00:08:06,024 --> 00:08:10,967
[SPEAKER_32]: All right, and it's lacking, it's lacking and never before and I mean, I've worked in local government now for

113
00:08:11,727 --> 00:08:19,571
[SPEAKER_32]: Shoot, since 1999, I represented union workers all across the Commonwealth from Worcester County to Springfield and back, all right, state, local.

114
00:08:19,971 --> 00:08:23,053
[SPEAKER_32]: And I've never seen anything like this before, where employees are treated like this.

115
00:08:23,693 --> 00:08:25,234
[SPEAKER_32]: And, you know, I just,

116
00:08:27,367 --> 00:08:30,108
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm afraid for you for being up here right now, tonight and speaking out.

117
00:08:30,528 --> 00:08:33,030
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm afraid for you right now from being up here and speaking out tonight.

118
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,110
[SPEAKER_02]: I could be afraid for myself also.

119
00:08:35,391 --> 00:08:40,113
[SPEAKER_02]: But there comes a point where everybody just has to do what is right.

120
00:08:41,013 --> 00:08:42,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't go for your own agendas.

121
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:43,774
[SPEAKER_02]: Do what is right.

122
00:08:43,794 --> 00:08:46,475
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't I don't understand it.

123
00:08:46,515 --> 00:08:49,677
[SPEAKER_32]: And the reason I say I'm scared for you right now is because I could go down a list of people

124
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:57,003
[SPEAKER_32]: have got they've gotten rid of come up here to this microphone and they've spoken out against some injustice, the councils agree with them, and those people are gone.

125
00:08:57,443 --> 00:08:59,504
[SPEAKER_32]: So we look at Brian Karen's Mike for ready.

126
00:09:00,004 --> 00:09:02,165
[SPEAKER_32]: Mike Durham, Aleesha Nunley, Molly kibbe.

127
00:09:03,146 --> 00:09:04,366
[SPEAKER_32]: That's five people, right?

128
00:09:04,386 --> 00:09:08,548
[SPEAKER_31]: That's five people, five people with families, five people who need health insurance.

129
00:09:09,429 --> 00:09:14,091
[SPEAKER_31]: Five people that committed to work for this community that came up here and spoke on behalf of the people and the taxpayers and the world let go.

130
00:09:15,441 --> 00:09:16,662
[SPEAKER_32]: I applaud you for your courage, Amy.

131
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:18,684
[SPEAKER_32]: I do applaud you for the courage that you have for coming up here.

132
00:09:18,924 --> 00:09:24,008
[SPEAKER_32]: I think a lot of this stuff really is mandatory topics of bargaining and mandatory topics of negotiation that need to be addressed at the table.

133
00:09:24,368 --> 00:09:29,712
[SPEAKER_32]: I agree with you that the actions of this body and the vote that some people take, given these people raises, there's no question about that.

134
00:09:29,812 --> 00:09:31,694
[SPEAKER_32]: The council needs to fund this, the mayor needs to propose it.

135
00:09:31,714 --> 00:09:35,016
[SPEAKER_32]: And the mayor did propose a significant pay hike for a number of people.

136
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:36,658
[SPEAKER_32]: What's the number councilor Bears?

137
00:09:36,698 --> 00:09:43,503
[SPEAKER_32]: I believe it was 16 requests have been made so far for reclassification of positions and the council is- 18, we rejected 16.

138
00:09:43,543 --> 00:09:44,023
[SPEAKER_32]: 18, we rejected 16.

139
00:09:46,526 --> 00:09:56,514
[SPEAKER_02]: When nobody listens to you in the negotiations, and your hands are tied, and you have nobody else to go to, this is my go-to right here.

140
00:09:56,614 --> 00:09:57,875
[SPEAKER_32]: I hear you, and you know what?

141
00:09:58,796 --> 00:10:01,779
[SPEAKER_32]: When nobody listens to us at this meeting, tonight's the night.

142
00:10:02,359 --> 00:10:04,001
[SPEAKER_32]: It's our go-to, all right?

143
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:11,888
[SPEAKER_32]: Because for a year, we've been sitting there, and we've been saying that we need certain tools in the toolbox to do a job for these people in this community, including you, including the workers in the city hall, and we haven't been given them.

144
00:10:13,049 --> 00:10:14,690
[SPEAKER_32]: We haven't been given the tools that we need to do the job.

145
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:27,736
[SPEAKER_32]: And tonight is gonna be a day of reckoning because I don't think there's anybody behind this rail based upon the debates that I've listened to that's happy with the direction that this community is going in, that's happy with the way that we've been treated, that's happy with the way employees have been treated in this community, right?

146
00:10:27,816 --> 00:10:36,200
[SPEAKER_32]: And I think that's safe to say, nobody behind this rail based upon the commentary and the minutes that have been approved by this body, that nobody behind this rail is happy with the direction this community is going in.

147
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,481
[SPEAKER_32]: All right, so think about how frustrated you are.

148
00:10:38,501 --> 00:10:39,902
[SPEAKER_32]: Now think about how frustrated we are.

149
00:10:40,842 --> 00:10:41,984
[SPEAKER_32]: We're the last stop.

150
00:10:42,024 --> 00:10:44,147
[SPEAKER_32]: You come to us for help and we can't get answers.

151
00:10:44,788 --> 00:10:53,741
[SPEAKER_32]: The only time we can get answers is from January 1st to, you know, maybe, maybe, sorry, June 1st to June 31st, June 30th, you know, right at the, right at the close of the fiscal year.

152
00:10:53,801 --> 00:10:54,542
[SPEAKER_32]: That's when we get answers.

153
00:10:56,172 --> 00:10:57,272
[SPEAKER_32]: Hi, Camilla.

154
00:10:57,572 --> 00:10:58,193
[SPEAKER_32]: Good, good to see you.

155
00:10:58,213 --> 00:11:03,394
[SPEAKER_19]: If you could just speak into the microphone.

156
00:11:04,114 --> 00:11:06,155
[SPEAKER_44]: Personally, I'm not afraid for my job.

157
00:11:06,955 --> 00:11:07,315
[SPEAKER_44]: Okay.

158
00:11:08,956 --> 00:11:10,116
[SPEAKER_44]: I'm disgusted.

159
00:11:10,896 --> 00:11:11,957
[SPEAKER_44]: It's a travesty.

160
00:11:13,117 --> 00:11:14,498
[SPEAKER_44]: Everything that's been going on.

161
00:11:14,978 --> 00:11:16,818
[SPEAKER_44]: I mean, bathroom deals.

162
00:11:17,999 --> 00:11:20,679
[SPEAKER_44]: I'm finding there's a lot of illegal stuff going on.

163
00:11:20,859 --> 00:11:25,481
[SPEAKER_44]: And I want to know what, who I can turn to legally.

164
00:11:26,636 --> 00:11:28,537
[SPEAKER_44]: to have this investigated.

165
00:11:28,977 --> 00:11:34,381
[SPEAKER_44]: Legally, if I can't get help from you people, then I'm going to have an outside source commit.

166
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:38,924
[SPEAKER_44]: Well, I think I have the budgeted audited.

167
00:11:40,345 --> 00:11:42,626
[SPEAKER_44]: I will go to the ends.

168
00:11:43,507 --> 00:11:46,028
[SPEAKER_44]: Because what I feel there's something going on.

169
00:11:46,568 --> 00:11:47,389
[SPEAKER_44]: And I don't like it.

170
00:11:47,709 --> 00:11:48,750
[SPEAKER_44]: I really don't like it.

171
00:11:50,903 --> 00:12:02,446
[SPEAKER_44]: I don't believe that these people she she's gonna give the man's gonna give raises the people that she knows are in her back pocket or whatever you want to say.

172
00:12:02,766 --> 00:12:06,547
[SPEAKER_44]: Whoever kisses her butt or whatever I'm going to say but on TV I don't care.

173
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:07,667
[SPEAKER_44]: Okay.

174
00:12:08,567 --> 00:12:10,208
[SPEAKER_44]: But the rest of us mean nothing.

175
00:12:10,588 --> 00:12:12,488
[SPEAKER_44]: I've been here 38 years.

176
00:12:13,248 --> 00:12:14,569
[SPEAKER_44]: I worked through COVID.

177
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:16,129
[SPEAKER_44]: I didn't stay home.

178
00:12:17,489 --> 00:12:19,830
[SPEAKER_44]: Okay, I didn't work to the zoom I came in.

179
00:12:21,684 --> 00:12:23,084
[SPEAKER_44]: I deserve respect.

180
00:12:23,184 --> 00:12:24,925
[SPEAKER_44]: I don't need to be disrespected.

181
00:12:24,965 --> 00:12:27,465
[SPEAKER_44]: And none of these girls need to be disrespected.

182
00:12:27,985 --> 00:12:30,306
[SPEAKER_44]: And I believe the paper should be involved.

183
00:12:31,106 --> 00:12:32,266
[SPEAKER_44]: I have to get the press.

184
00:12:32,726 --> 00:12:33,666
[SPEAKER_44]: I'll get the press.

185
00:12:34,646 --> 00:12:39,707
[SPEAKER_44]: I have to get the auditor in... the state auditor, I will get the state auditor in.

186
00:12:40,507 --> 00:12:44,288
[SPEAKER_44]: I want to know what KP laws get paid every year.

187
00:12:45,528 --> 00:12:48,349
[SPEAKER_44]: And let a good solicitor go to bring in that company.

188
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:50,387
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, here's the problem, Camilla.

189
00:12:50,447 --> 00:12:55,810
[SPEAKER_32]: I mean, ultimately, you want to time out point of information, you ask the question, let me answer it.

190
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:56,030
[SPEAKER_32]: Right.

191
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,751
[SPEAKER_32]: So you want to know where you can go and where you can turn, right?

192
00:12:58,052 --> 00:12:59,913
[SPEAKER_32]: I'd say I'd say turn to the city solicitor.

193
00:13:00,373 --> 00:13:01,514
[SPEAKER_32]: But we don't have a city solicitor.

194
00:13:01,554 --> 00:13:05,556
[SPEAKER_32]: We have no we have nobody in the law department that's here represent the interest of the taxpayers.

195
00:13:05,897 --> 00:13:09,339
[SPEAKER_44]: The mayor has a the mayor has a private law firm on TV.

196
00:13:10,459 --> 00:13:14,022
[SPEAKER_44]: Okay, know who you're voting in next November.

197
00:13:15,145 --> 00:13:16,386
[SPEAKER_44]: That's all I have to say.

198
00:13:16,986 --> 00:13:22,088
[SPEAKER_44]: Because this city has gone to, I'm not even gonna use the word.

199
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:26,210
[SPEAKER_44]: Never have I seen anything like this.

200
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,030
[SPEAKER_44]: I am disgusted.

201
00:13:28,491 --> 00:13:32,092
[SPEAKER_44]: And if she wants to try and fire me after tonight, let her.

202
00:13:33,093 --> 00:13:34,693
[SPEAKER_44]: Because I have legal backing.

203
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:38,555
[SPEAKER_44]: I have a right to stand here and say what I wanna say.

204
00:13:38,975 --> 00:13:43,297
[SPEAKER_44]: And I have a right to tell the people of Medford, she's not a good mayor.

205
00:13:50,444 --> 00:14:02,648
[SPEAKER_02]: What I've also realized, besides that paperwork that I gave you, I looked on the agenda tonight, and I also noticed that she put out an amended budget for this year, it was put out on June 14.

206
00:14:06,673 --> 00:14:11,136
[SPEAKER_02]: She is asking for a lot more in salaries than what I read off to you.

207
00:14:11,577 --> 00:14:17,461
[SPEAKER_02]: So people, the assessor's office and salaries, they're asking for more than $37,000 extra.

208
00:14:18,061 --> 00:14:27,768
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the election committee, now they're putting part time, they're making one position supposedly part time, which they shouldn't be able to do, but they're asking for another $103,000.

209
00:14:31,169 --> 00:14:31,690
[SPEAKER_02]: salaries?

210
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:32,370
[SPEAKER_02]: How was that?

211
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:33,911
[SPEAKER_02]: How was that even possible?

212
00:14:34,372 --> 00:14:34,852
[SPEAKER_02]: How?

213
00:14:35,232 --> 00:14:37,414
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how people can allow this to go on.

214
00:14:39,976 --> 00:14:42,538
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I can, can people can somebody tell me something?

215
00:14:42,578 --> 00:14:44,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Can somebody like at least respond?

216
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:50,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Can somebody tell me that this is not okay, but actually back up their words?

217
00:14:52,226 --> 00:14:57,110
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, everybody here is telling me that all we're behind you, you know, go out and do this.

218
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,412
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be right behind you.

219
00:14:59,012 --> 00:14:59,773
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I hear

220
00:15:00,626 --> 00:15:04,428
[SPEAKER_02]: that there's a backroom deal that this is all set already.

221
00:15:04,689 --> 00:15:15,856
[SPEAKER_02]: So all of my words and all of everything that we've tried to explain to you, person to person, not even not even Councilor to employee, just as human beings.

222
00:15:16,756 --> 00:15:29,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Does everybody understand that once this budget is passed, all these people that are already making so much money are getting good raises, and me, who's making what, $56,000?

223
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,075
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't afford it.

224
00:15:32,096 --> 00:15:33,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody has to do something.

225
00:15:34,246 --> 00:15:35,728
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, Amy, I think that's inaccurate.

226
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:41,876
[SPEAKER_32]: The raises that have been, the raises that you're referring to have already been passed and they've already been funded.

227
00:15:42,457 --> 00:15:46,802
[SPEAKER_32]: So regardless of whether or not this budget passed, these pay scales established by ordinance.

228
00:15:47,731 --> 00:15:55,174
[SPEAKER_32]: everything except for I think Mary's position, the one that you referred to, because that hasn't been passed by ordinance and the human resources position that they keep ignoring us on.

229
00:15:55,795 --> 00:16:07,140
[SPEAKER_32]: But ultimately, these classifications for non-union titles and the cost of living adjustment that's attached there too, was passed by this body, not unanimously, but it was passed by this body and it was funded by this body.

230
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:16,987
[SPEAKER_02]: So everybody, wait a second, everybody's entitled to a cost of living increase, except for, we're not even at the minimum level here.

231
00:16:17,167 --> 00:16:20,870
[SPEAKER_02]: We're below, we're almost at poverty level here, people.

232
00:16:21,371 --> 00:16:23,692
[SPEAKER_32]: Right, but you have the power to negotiate in these non-union policies.

233
00:16:23,712 --> 00:16:26,034
[SPEAKER_02]: We have no power, do you understand what it's like?

234
00:16:26,094 --> 00:16:28,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we did ask and you guys weren't allowed to come in.

235
00:16:28,836 --> 00:16:30,398
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like talking to a wall.

236
00:16:31,238 --> 00:16:36,722
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, it's better to go get a wall, bang your head against it, and maybe you'll get something done.

237
00:16:37,723 --> 00:16:44,729
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm sure everybody here that's going to pass the budget got exactly what they wanted right everybody's going to get what they want.

238
00:16:45,169 --> 00:16:47,491
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's see if it really goes through.

239
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:53,696
[SPEAKER_32]: So just a question so the negotiations between the clerical union and the administration I'm going well.

240
00:16:54,966 --> 00:17:04,172
[SPEAKER_32]: Really, no, I'm just thinking back to when the mayor put her budget presentation on opening night, and she said how great negotiations are going with all the negotiations and how close they were to settle.

241
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:07,273
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not happening.

242
00:17:07,374 --> 00:17:08,834
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Amy Thank you so much.

243
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:14,318
[SPEAKER_16]: I understand your frustration, and but again this is the fundamental issues we're having

244
00:17:15,421 --> 00:17:16,281
[SPEAKER_16]: and society, right?

245
00:17:16,562 --> 00:17:19,303
[SPEAKER_16]: Everybody wants to talk about supporting the union.

246
00:17:19,463 --> 00:17:38,073
[SPEAKER_16]: It sounds good, it looks good on your paraphernalia you're gonna mail out that you're supported or you're whatever for this, but I want you to realize, and I want my fellow councils to realize, this is something I've been saying from the beginning, any money paper that's come, unless it was urgent, I voted no.

247
00:17:38,213 --> 00:17:41,695
[SPEAKER_16]: Any vote for raises for non-union employees, I voted no.

248
00:17:42,617 --> 00:17:48,279
[SPEAKER_16]: I implored, I expressed that to my fellow Councilors and they passed, unfortunately.

249
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:49,559
[SPEAKER_16]: I voted no.

250
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:54,241
[SPEAKER_16]: What I will tell you is the other issue that I see, it's pretty damaging.

251
00:17:54,721 --> 00:17:56,902
[SPEAKER_16]: When you look behind you, I don't see one male.

252
00:17:58,102 --> 00:18:02,064
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't see one male employee that hasn't got when they need it.

253
00:18:02,744 --> 00:18:07,566
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know this council in the past have talked about the rights of women and making sure there's equality here.

254
00:18:08,735 --> 00:18:09,775
[SPEAKER_16]: And I don't see that either.

255
00:18:10,636 --> 00:18:12,516
[SPEAKER_16]: So here's the thing, I'm not afraid either.

256
00:18:12,536 --> 00:18:15,317
[SPEAKER_16]: I lived in this community my whole life.

257
00:18:15,617 --> 00:18:20,119
[SPEAKER_16]: I've been an elected official since I left teaching in 2008.

258
00:18:20,959 --> 00:18:22,759
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not afraid to say what I have to say.

259
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:27,441
[SPEAKER_16]: But what I'm sad for you is you're being used as a pawn.

260
00:18:28,421 --> 00:18:36,584
[SPEAKER_16]: Unions are being used as a pawn, whether it's the lieutenant governor, whether it's the governor's office, whether it's state representatives or whether it's this council.

261
00:18:37,788 --> 00:18:39,049
[SPEAKER_16]: So what can I tell you?

262
00:18:39,149 --> 00:18:40,170
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't tell you anything.

263
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:44,373
[SPEAKER_16]: You're going through horrible negotiations because nobody is standing up for you.

264
00:18:44,674 --> 00:18:45,494
[SPEAKER_16]: This is the time.

265
00:18:45,614 --> 00:18:49,498
[SPEAKER_16]: Right now, I thought today, when I came here, I said, well, this is the time.

266
00:18:50,318 --> 00:18:59,546
[SPEAKER_16]: We've talked about a council that have worked together pretty closely in the past year, making sure good initiatives get passed, even without any of the tools that were promised us last year.

267
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:11,162
[SPEAKER_16]: So this is the time, when we vote later, you're going to realize where you should focus on, where the city should focus on, where unions should focus on.

268
00:19:11,602 --> 00:19:18,045
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I'll be honest with you, if you keep giving and you keep giving, what is she gonna do?

269
00:19:18,505 --> 00:19:19,446
[SPEAKER_16]: She's gonna keep taking.

270
00:19:19,466 --> 00:19:20,446
[SPEAKER_16]: Until what?

271
00:19:21,086 --> 00:19:22,027
[SPEAKER_16]: You say stop.

272
00:19:23,147 --> 00:19:25,108
[SPEAKER_16]: Last year we said stop.

273
00:19:25,988 --> 00:19:27,449
[SPEAKER_16]: And at least we were heard.

274
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:30,090
[SPEAKER_16]: At least we were heard.

275
00:19:31,834 --> 00:19:47,209
[SPEAKER_16]: With the presentation later with the budget, I know Councilor Caraviello has worked extensively in putting some numbers together, that when I think that people hear it, and if anybody would vote for this budget after you hear these numbers, it'll be appalling for me.

276
00:19:47,829 --> 00:19:53,134
[SPEAKER_16]: So what I could tell you and your fellow colleagues that are getting the short end of the stick again,

277
00:19:55,051 --> 00:20:01,454
[SPEAKER_16]: is all I could do is apologize from one city councilor to one department in the city that keeps us running every single day.

278
00:20:01,874 --> 00:20:04,296
[SPEAKER_16]: I apologize that you haven't even have to go through this.

279
00:20:04,956 --> 00:20:06,076
[SPEAKER_16]: This is a disgrace.

280
00:20:07,357 --> 00:20:08,418
[SPEAKER_16]: This is sad for me.

281
00:20:09,778 --> 00:20:11,199
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I ask who here?

282
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:17,062
[SPEAKER_02]: Who here did say yes to everybody getting well the non union people getting raises?

283
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:17,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Who here?

284
00:20:17,982 --> 00:20:18,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Who here said yes?

285
00:20:20,704 --> 00:20:21,184
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, really?

286
00:20:22,233 --> 00:20:25,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, all four of you had said you were going to stand behind us.

287
00:20:26,155 --> 00:20:27,235
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't understand it.

288
00:20:27,475 --> 00:20:29,937
[SPEAKER_02]: I just so you it was a slap in the face.

289
00:20:29,977 --> 00:20:30,797
[SPEAKER_02]: You lied to me.

290
00:20:31,517 --> 00:20:32,318
[SPEAKER_02]: You lied to me.

291
00:20:32,378 --> 00:20:33,718
[SPEAKER_02]: You lied to all these women.

292
00:20:33,738 --> 00:20:35,259
[SPEAKER_02]: You lied to the employees.

293
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:36,800
[SPEAKER_02]: You lied to the citizens.

294
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:37,840
[SPEAKER_08]: For a point of clarification.

295
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,981
[SPEAKER_08]: This vote was early.

296
00:20:39,001 --> 00:20:43,563
[SPEAKER_08]: This was I mean, you're absolutely entails you feel like this vote was prior to you coming before us.

297
00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:47,905
[SPEAKER_08]: This vote was prior to what prior to you coming before us to speak at public participation.

298
00:20:49,107 --> 00:20:51,328
[SPEAKER_08]: This vote was- I've spoken months ago too.

299
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,729
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, but I just want to make clear if it wasn't the most recent one.

300
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:57,210
[SPEAKER_02]: Is anybody ashamed of themselves?

301
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:58,951
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not, I stand by my vote.

302
00:20:58,971 --> 00:21:00,671
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a 2% raise over three years.

303
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:01,412
[SPEAKER_08]: It was 2%, 2%, 2%.

304
00:21:01,872 --> 00:21:02,372
[SPEAKER_08]: This is 2%?

305
00:21:02,812 --> 00:21:03,993
[SPEAKER_08]: It compounds.

306
00:21:04,053 --> 00:21:04,553
[SPEAKER_24]: No it wasn't.

307
00:21:04,853 --> 00:21:05,413
[SPEAKER_24]: It was four.

308
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:06,474
[SPEAKER_08]: What we voted for was 2%.

309
00:21:07,054 --> 00:21:08,194
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my God.

310
00:21:08,214 --> 00:21:09,215
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at the numbers.

311
00:21:09,475 --> 00:21:11,155
[SPEAKER_24]: It compounds, it's compound interest.

312
00:21:11,175 --> 00:21:12,136
[SPEAKER_24]: That's why it's more than 6%.

313
00:21:12,176 --> 00:21:14,817
[SPEAKER_16]: You wouldn't know what compound is because you weren't given a raise for six years.

314
00:21:15,117 --> 00:21:16,537
[SPEAKER_16]: So that actually explained to you later.

315
00:21:16,758 --> 00:21:17,738
[SPEAKER_16]: You wouldn't know that, I'm sorry.

316
00:21:18,078 --> 00:21:21,700
[SPEAKER_02]: You talk about giving the other people cost of living increases.

317
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Bring their salaries up so they can survive.

318
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:26,202
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's my cost of living increase?

319
00:21:26,282 --> 00:21:31,765
[SPEAKER_32]: Amy, the council did also in that proposal that was given to us, the mayor didn't tell us what classifications were included in that.

320
00:21:31,865 --> 00:21:37,167
[SPEAKER_32]: And then when we did an investigation and we looked into it, we found that the executive was included in that.

321
00:21:37,187 --> 00:21:40,749
[SPEAKER_32]: The mayor proposed a raise for herself in that proposal and we cut that out.

322
00:21:41,109 --> 00:21:44,351
[SPEAKER_32]: And the mayor had also proposed a raise for the council and we cut that raise out as well.

323
00:21:45,071 --> 00:21:51,000
[SPEAKER_32]: You know what I mean, to stand by what we've said that you know what I mean, rising tide floats all ships and we think that you guys should go so...

323
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:57,618
[SPEAKER_02]: you think department heads that started six months ago, three months ago, whatever deserved a raise that they got.

324
00:21:58,358 --> 00:21:59,459
[SPEAKER_02]: They haven't even been here.

325
00:22:00,407 --> 00:22:01,507
[SPEAKER_02]: For a year, yes?

326
00:22:02,228 --> 00:22:03,928
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been here 23 years.

327
00:22:04,408 --> 00:22:05,869
[SPEAKER_32]: Again, these are cost of living adjustments.

328
00:22:05,889 --> 00:22:07,249
[SPEAKER_32]: They're not performance-based.

329
00:22:07,289 --> 00:22:08,869
[SPEAKER_02]: I need a cost of living adjustment.

330
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:11,290
[SPEAKER_32]: Right, but you're in a union, so you gotta negotiate that.

331
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,091
[SPEAKER_32]: They don't, you know, you have a collective bargaining.

332
00:22:13,111 --> 00:22:15,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Not once has the mayor come in for a negotiation.

333
00:22:15,511 --> 00:22:18,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Not once has she said to us, I think this is important.

334
00:22:19,532 --> 00:22:20,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me talk to you people.

335
00:22:21,513 --> 00:22:22,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Not once.

336
00:22:23,493 --> 00:22:26,654
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and all of you look like deer in headlights here, but you know what?

337
00:22:26,694 --> 00:22:28,315
[SPEAKER_02]: You're all getting everything you want.

338
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:41,274
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got to go back every time I see a job posting in little little print at the bottom, it says that everything, all the job description, it's, it can include more than what is listed.

339
00:22:42,354 --> 00:22:45,436
[SPEAKER_02]: So in other words, I can tell you that I'm doing this and this.

340
00:22:45,736 --> 00:22:51,359
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the end, if they asked me to do even more, that's part of my job description, though it wasn't written there.

341
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,139
[SPEAKER_02]: So when when do I stop?

342
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,180
[SPEAKER_02]: I do the budget for the department.

343
00:22:55,821 --> 00:22:56,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

344
00:22:56,661 --> 00:22:57,682
[SPEAKER_02]: I did for

345
00:22:58,902 --> 00:23:02,003
[SPEAKER_02]: 20 years, I did facilities, right?

346
00:23:02,203 --> 00:23:06,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they got a whole new person, which is fine by me, because it's not worth the aggravation.

347
00:23:07,284 --> 00:23:14,365
[SPEAKER_02]: But all this extra work that I personally did because I love this city, and I liked my job is nothing.

348
00:23:14,845 --> 00:23:15,525
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all gone.

349
00:23:15,545 --> 00:23:18,265
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, thank you.

350
00:23:18,405 --> 00:23:20,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Madam President.

351
00:23:21,006 --> 00:23:21,226
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

352
00:23:28,504 --> 00:23:30,465
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel for every one of us.

353
00:23:30,565 --> 00:23:32,785
[SPEAKER_10]: I was one of the ones that did not support the non-union vote.

354
00:23:33,485 --> 00:23:40,007
[SPEAKER_10]: And not that the non-union people do not deserve a raise, they deserve a raise just like everyone else does.

355
00:23:40,047 --> 00:23:45,809
[SPEAKER_10]: But I come from a culture where these are the people that make the city run.

356
00:23:46,749 --> 00:23:49,170
[SPEAKER_10]: And you're the ones that make the department heads look good.

357
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:54,511
[SPEAKER_10]: Bosses should never, ever, ever get a raise before their employees.

358
00:23:55,071 --> 00:23:56,812
[SPEAKER_10]: The city is similar to a business.

359
00:23:57,864 --> 00:24:00,005
[SPEAKER_10]: Your raise should be similar to the teacher's raise.

360
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:03,547
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody in the city should all get the same raise across the board.

361
00:24:03,847 --> 00:24:06,629
[SPEAKER_10]: What makes your job any less important than the teacher's?

362
00:24:06,729 --> 00:24:11,672
[SPEAKER_10]: What makes your job any less important than the fireman or the policeman or anybody else who works in this city?

363
00:24:12,532 --> 00:24:13,513
[SPEAKER_10]: We all work for the same thing.

364
00:24:13,753 --> 00:24:15,334
[SPEAKER_10]: We all work at the same common goal.

365
00:24:15,714 --> 00:24:20,136
[SPEAKER_10]: This is not, we're gonna pick and choose who we get raises, but this is how this group work.

366
00:24:20,176 --> 00:24:22,538
[SPEAKER_10]: We pick and choose who gets raises, who gets how much.

367
00:24:24,167 --> 00:24:26,069
[SPEAKER_10]: Teachers went out there and picketed forever.

368
00:24:26,289 --> 00:24:29,511
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe you women should get out there and picket in front, like the teachers did.

369
00:24:29,631 --> 00:24:32,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well, we did that and it didn't end up well.

370
00:24:32,093 --> 00:24:33,234
[SPEAKER_10]: It didn't end up well.

371
00:24:33,574 --> 00:24:35,916
[SPEAKER_10]: But again, everybody should be getting the same rates here.

372
00:24:36,877 --> 00:24:38,678
[SPEAKER_10]: Different departments shouldn't get it.

373
00:24:38,718 --> 00:24:40,039
[SPEAKER_10]: You're all essential workers here.

374
00:24:40,599 --> 00:24:42,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and I understand- All work during COVID.

375
00:24:43,652 --> 00:24:46,613
[SPEAKER_10]: when you just bought $4,500 to know that.

376
00:24:46,893 --> 00:24:47,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I do.

377
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:48,514
[SPEAKER_02]: I know all of it.

378
00:24:48,734 --> 00:24:49,834
[SPEAKER_10]: You people work during COVID.

379
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:51,155
[SPEAKER_10]: Policemen work during COVID.

380
00:24:51,335 --> 00:24:52,355
[SPEAKER_10]: Firemen work during COVID.

381
00:24:52,395 --> 00:24:53,436
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody worked during COVID.

382
00:24:54,416 --> 00:24:57,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you guys come in for COVID when when you had meetings?

383
00:24:57,677 --> 00:24:59,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Or were you behind a TV screen?

384
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:01,339
[SPEAKER_08]: Amy, I'm gonna let you continue.

385
00:25:01,539 --> 00:25:01,939
[SPEAKER_08]: We do.

386
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,320
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm being very generous with time.

387
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,000
[SPEAKER_08]: I understand you're upset.

388
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,121
[SPEAKER_08]: You have every right to be upset.

389
00:25:07,042 --> 00:25:11,105
[SPEAKER_08]: We give people 10 minutes for public participation, we're nearing a half hour, I'm absolutely gonna let you finish.

390
00:25:11,165 --> 00:25:15,768
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm gonna get to- Everyone in this building deserves the same raise that the teachers got, which is the 3%.

391
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:18,450
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, I think we deserve more.

392
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:20,151
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that's it, but let's see.

393
00:25:20,672 --> 00:25:23,173
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want everybody to know- Nobody is less important than anyone else here.

394
00:25:23,454 --> 00:25:28,617
[SPEAKER_02]: The president is gonna cut me off soon, which I understand, but I want everybody to know you're being lied to.

395
00:25:29,998 --> 00:25:33,761
[SPEAKER_02]: You're being lied to and you're accepting it, right?

396
00:25:33,821 --> 00:25:34,622
[SPEAKER_02]: We're better than this.

397
00:25:36,585 --> 00:25:42,230
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so disgusted by what I see on a daily basis, what I hear on a daily basis.

398
00:25:43,691 --> 00:25:49,656
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, you know, the citizens of Medford need to know the truth.

399
00:25:50,817 --> 00:25:52,579
[SPEAKER_02]: And sadly they don't know.

400
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:56,662
[SPEAKER_02]: And sadly things keep going on and on and they get worse and worse.

401
00:25:57,868 --> 00:26:09,298
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're left behind, as usual, right 3% raise for me is well 2% would have been 56 cents an hour so 3% wouldn't have been that much more.

402
00:26:10,418 --> 00:26:11,459
[SPEAKER_02]: What am I going to do with that.

403
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:14,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me what I'm going to do with 56 cents an hour.

404
00:26:16,083 --> 00:26:17,865
[SPEAKER_02]: What would you do with it, what would you do with it.

405
00:26:21,468 --> 00:26:22,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Collins.

406
00:26:23,169 --> 00:26:25,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

407
00:26:25,811 --> 00:26:26,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, President Morell.

408
00:26:27,543 --> 00:26:28,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Amy, thank you for being here.

409
00:26:28,604 --> 00:26:32,025
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't feel entitled to you sympathizing with anything that I have to say.

410
00:26:32,325 --> 00:26:33,386
[SPEAKER_05]: You have every right to be upset.

411
00:26:33,546 --> 00:26:36,388
[SPEAKER_05]: I just, I don't want you to get up here and put yourself out there and may not respond.

412
00:26:37,868 --> 00:26:46,573
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to say, if you think that we're getting everything that we want, I feel like we're not getting anything that we want.

413
00:26:46,593 --> 00:26:49,394
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm speaking from the heart here, person to person.

414
00:26:52,756 --> 00:26:54,297
[SPEAKER_05]: I want everybody in the city to get a raise.

415
00:26:54,877 --> 00:26:55,758
[SPEAKER_05]: We're the city council.

416
00:26:57,099 --> 00:26:59,299
[SPEAKER_05]: cannot negotiate with unions.

417
00:26:59,379 --> 00:27:00,680
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't make appropriations.

418
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:08,581
[SPEAKER_05]: It's why my drumbeat for the past three months has been about these charter amendments, which I hope that I would get a call from the mayor by today saying that she's something to the AG and she didn't.

419
00:27:09,221 --> 00:27:13,802
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why my persistent frustration has been with our lack of power during this budget process.

420
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:20,003
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's not fair to me that your negotiations are not resolved.

421
00:27:20,103 --> 00:27:20,963
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not at all fair.

422
00:27:21,783 --> 00:27:25,304
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole process of bargaining negotiations of the city, I think,

423
00:27:26,576 --> 00:27:27,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously unfair.

424
00:27:27,959 --> 00:27:29,221
[SPEAKER_05]: Not everybody should get the same thing.

425
00:27:29,261 --> 00:27:31,746
[SPEAKER_05]: The people who are paid the least should get the most and it should go up from there.

426
00:27:33,229 --> 00:27:37,176
[SPEAKER_05]: All that is to say, I don't want you to think, well, you can think whatever you want.

427
00:27:38,285 --> 00:27:40,947
[SPEAKER_05]: But I want to put on the record, I don't think that what's happening is acceptable.

428
00:27:41,348 --> 00:27:47,593
[SPEAKER_05]: I am looking at a situation where so much of what we see is deeply, deeply, deeply unacceptable to me, deeply unacceptable and unfair.

429
00:27:47,613 --> 00:27:48,514
[SPEAKER_05]: And it makes me sad.

430
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:53,177
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes me sad, but I am aware of the legal limits of my power.

431
00:27:53,237 --> 00:28:00,303
[SPEAKER_05]: So when a paper comes before me to give some employees a raise, if I have the opportunity to say yes to a raise for some people, I'll say yes to that.

432
00:28:00,383 --> 00:28:04,547
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm going to wish with all my heart that I had the ability to transmit that raise to people.

433
00:28:04,827 --> 00:28:09,770
[SPEAKER_05]: that have to negotiate for it and I am sorry that I can't do more materially for you and your union in this situation.

434
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:14,654
[SPEAKER_02]: You can change the budget right you can change line items and not, or you can't change anything.

435
00:28:14,794 --> 00:28:19,677
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I was told what a meeting or two ago, you can reduce, you can reduce and reduce.

436
00:28:19,877 --> 00:28:25,601
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it, we can add, cut down something that's important, something that they need, make a point.

437
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:40,203
[SPEAKER_32]: And I just want to just be on that point we did that last year Amy we did that at what one o'clock in the morning the mayor came up here in the magic money tree in her that grows in her office she shook it bunch of money fell out of it next thing you know we were going to get a lawyer that was going to come and help us out with zoning never happened.

438
00:28:40,783 --> 00:28:42,544
[SPEAKER_32]: What else we're going to get out of that deal.

439
00:28:43,104 --> 00:28:46,305
[SPEAKER_32]: City solicitor yeah assistant city solicitor the city council, never happened.

440
00:28:46,885 --> 00:28:49,746
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, it's something else was supposed to come out of that too I think but you know what I mean.

441
00:28:49,946 --> 00:28:57,532
[SPEAKER_32]: And then the way that they were going to fund all of these promises that they made to the council was they were going to take the money out of the negotiated salaries account, which is the account that they use to fund your raises.

442
00:28:57,873 --> 00:29:00,295
[SPEAKER_32]: And this council said, no, you're not taking the money out of that account.

443
00:29:00,775 --> 00:29:01,075
[SPEAKER_32]: All right.

444
00:29:01,115 --> 00:29:06,540
[SPEAKER_32]: So if you want to find magic money, you better find it somewhere else because you're not balancing this budget on the back of the working people in this community.

445
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,082
[SPEAKER_32]: And the mayor went and took the money out of the public utility account.

446
00:29:09,382 --> 00:29:15,107
[SPEAKER_32]: So now we look at the transfers that are on the agenda this evening, we'll see hundreds of thousands of dollars in transfers so that we can pay to keep the lights on.

447
00:29:16,397 --> 00:29:17,238
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Collins, are you finished?

448
00:29:17,779 --> 00:29:18,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

449
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:18,460
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

450
00:29:18,901 --> 00:29:21,826
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Tseng.

451
00:29:22,086 --> 00:29:25,211
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be brief, and if I have more, I'll go after.

452
00:29:27,611 --> 00:29:55,268
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you're upset at us because of that vote that we took a while ago, and I don't think I can say anything that will make you feel better about the situation, and I know a lot of the folks in the crowd tonight, I know you guys personally, and I have to be upfront that I don't think I'm gonna make you guys happy in an instant, but I will say that vote that we took back then was, in my mind, the deciding question for it was, will this really help

453
00:29:55,788 --> 00:29:58,752
[SPEAKER_07]: the unions that are negotiating contracts, get what they want.

454
00:29:59,192 --> 00:30:10,466
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think we discussed it in detail back then, the answer that in my experience of dealing in with, you know, different players in this in the city, the answer was no.

455
00:30:11,152 --> 00:30:29,090
[SPEAKER_07]: And the answer was that whatever would happen would happen other channels, and not through this and I couldn't because of that answer I couldn't use that to justify holding up 2% raises for people who still work for the city or still city workers, and I understand that you guys are going to be super upset about that with me.

456
00:30:29,811 --> 00:30:32,834
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but that was the reason why I took that vote.

457
00:30:33,034 --> 00:30:34,375
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the reason why I still support that.

458
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:48,964
[SPEAKER_02]: But why, tell me why, why did you think it was okay to leave us behind again and say it's okay for higher ups, for men, for people that are managers, why is it okay for them?

459
00:30:49,424 --> 00:30:49,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me.

460
00:30:50,125 --> 00:30:54,526
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it wasn't a question of leaving one group behind.

461
00:30:54,646 --> 00:30:58,348
[SPEAKER_07]: For me, the question was why yes, why no, and what if.

462
00:30:58,968 --> 00:31:03,890
[SPEAKER_07]: And there were there there were there were there answers for why yes and why no.

463
00:31:04,271 --> 00:31:07,632
[SPEAKER_07]: So for me, when I thought of what if, what if we didn't do this?

464
00:31:07,672 --> 00:31:08,733
[SPEAKER_07]: Would it help you guys?

465
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:15,456
[SPEAKER_07]: The answer was no, but it would, it would have also left a big group of city employees behind and I couldn't let that happen as well.

466
00:31:15,636 --> 00:31:21,459
[SPEAKER_02]: So you could only just let us suffer the women behind the scenes have to be over it, Amy.

467
00:31:22,259 --> 00:31:25,701
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to help you have control over saying no to those other raises.

468
00:31:26,232 --> 00:31:29,935
[SPEAKER_24]: Right, we had some specific things that came through on raises that we were able to dispute.

469
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:37,720
[SPEAKER_24]: We got 30 things put before us and we had employees in the city saying, and by the way, a majority of the positions in that were not department heads.

470
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:40,762
[SPEAKER_24]: They're just non-union people who are not department heads.

471
00:31:41,382 --> 00:31:49,628
[SPEAKER_24]: And they have, you know, some of these people are making 60, $65,000 a year also saying to me, I can't afford XYZ and I need this raise.

472
00:31:49,988 --> 00:31:53,251
[SPEAKER_24]: And what I had before me, what we had before us was a paper that said,

473
00:31:54,278 --> 00:31:58,983
[SPEAKER_24]: that said you can give some people something or you can give no one anything and it's going to help nothing.

474
00:31:59,804 --> 00:32:05,251
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm what you came before us I think two two meetings ago, and we were sitting here and you said vote down the budget.

475
00:32:05,631 --> 00:32:08,815
[SPEAKER_24]: And I said to you guys, I said, it's not going to get us anything.

476
00:32:09,673 --> 00:32:12,454
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not gonna get us anything because it's not, we've threatened it.

477
00:32:12,534 --> 00:32:16,756
[SPEAKER_24]: We've threatened a million things over and over again to vote down this, to vote down that.

478
00:32:16,776 --> 00:32:21,598
[SPEAKER_24]: We voted down 16 of the 18 things and it hasn't made a single difference in the negotiations.

479
00:32:21,958 --> 00:32:23,459
[SPEAKER_24]: I tried to attend the negotiations.

480
00:32:23,499 --> 00:32:25,299
[SPEAKER_24]: I wasn't allowed to attend the negotiations.

481
00:32:25,699 --> 00:32:35,103
[SPEAKER_24]: And I said before you and got quite a bit of pushback from the mayor's office that I would 100% be on the picket line for a strike because I think four years of no contract is ridiculous.

482
00:32:35,443 --> 00:32:39,225
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think that the negotiations aren't being done in the way that I would wanna do them.

483
00:32:39,685 --> 00:32:40,786
[SPEAKER_02]: not in good faith at all.

484
00:32:41,146 --> 00:32:45,209
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's, you know, one of the reasons I wanted to sit down was to see it for myself and confirm that.

485
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:51,634
[SPEAKER_24]: Now, the choices that I have before me, right, and we've had conversations about this here.

486
00:32:52,855 --> 00:32:55,337
[SPEAKER_24]: I want to open up the budget process.

487
00:32:55,457 --> 00:32:56,938
[SPEAKER_24]: I want to see more information.

488
00:32:57,038 --> 00:33:05,004
[SPEAKER_24]: I want us to be able to have real discussions here on this council about how we move forward, about how we fund staff, about how we fund contracts, because that's the purview.

489
00:33:05,084 --> 00:33:07,006
[SPEAKER_24]: That's as far as we can go here in the purview here.

490
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:07,907
[SPEAKER_24]: We can't negotiate.

491
00:33:08,647 --> 00:33:15,550
[SPEAKER_24]: the contracts and we can't, by all the times that we've tried and all the ways that we've tried, have had no impact on the negotiations.

492
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:28,316
[SPEAKER_24]: And when the decision or the question is before us to tell people they're not going to get raises because other people didn't get raises, or effectively shut down the city because people didn't get raises, I have to weigh the harm of that too.

493
00:33:28,936 --> 00:33:35,219
[SPEAKER_24]: And when I know that those decisions are going to be incredibly harmful, and we're not going to get anything anyway, because we're just going to get waited out,

494
00:33:36,567 --> 00:33:48,819
[SPEAKER_24]: I have to try to find something that's gonna improve the process in the future because better or worse, it seems that this is how it's been going for four years and the voters could make the same choice again.

495
00:33:50,086 --> 00:33:52,468
[SPEAKER_24]: And so it's an incredibly difficult position.

496
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:54,530
[SPEAKER_24]: I work in labor every day.

497
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:57,373
[SPEAKER_24]: I work in an organization where I've worked for years.

498
00:33:57,393 --> 00:33:58,394
[SPEAKER_24]: I've been a union member.

499
00:33:59,155 --> 00:34:01,337
[SPEAKER_24]: I have never seen a negotiation go this long.

500
00:34:01,357 --> 00:34:09,965
[SPEAKER_24]: I've advocated for changes to state law to basically put a shot clock on public sector negotiations because they shouldn't be allowed to drag out this long.

501
00:34:10,971 --> 00:34:17,416
[SPEAKER_24]: And I'm a supporter of the public employee right to strike because I think that's a way to force people to the table when you don't feel like they're negotiating in good faith.

502
00:34:17,937 --> 00:34:25,663
[SPEAKER_24]: All I know here is that when we say no to stuff about, because it's about the labor relations piece of things, it doesn't impact the negotiations.

503
00:34:26,363 --> 00:34:29,766
[SPEAKER_24]: And so that's how I think about these things.

504
00:34:30,326 --> 00:34:38,132
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm just trying to work as best as I can to make as much progress, to have the information and the open public discussions

505
00:34:39,033 --> 00:34:42,237
[SPEAKER_24]: so that voters are informed and educated about what the budget looks like.

506
00:34:42,737 --> 00:34:50,606
[SPEAKER_24]: And I don't think that voting down these non-union raises would have helped the negotiations, because we voted down 15 raises before that didn't help the negotiations.

507
00:34:50,946 --> 00:34:58,795
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't think voting down the budget is going to help the negotiations, because we voted down a bunch of money papers and we voted down the budget last year and it didn't help the negotiations.

508
00:34:59,295 --> 00:35:01,175
[SPEAKER_24]: So I'm taking a different strategy.

509
00:35:01,256 --> 00:35:19,360
[SPEAKER_24]: My question really is what's the strategy, I'd be happy to sit down and talk through the strategic approach and see how we can be helpful and try new things because what we're being asked, and you haven't necessarily made the explicit asked but the ideas of just voting down non union raises are voting down the budget and voting down money papers haven't been effective, and I can't.

510
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:32,905
[SPEAKER_24]: repeat an ineffective strategy because it may make us feel better that we said no and stood up to something, but if we still get nothing at the end and somebody else gets hurt, it's just not, that's not fair either.

511
00:35:33,205 --> 00:35:38,667
[SPEAKER_24]: So I hear how much, I think you should get a market adjustment and a raise.

512
00:35:39,509 --> 00:35:41,430
[SPEAKER_24]: Like that's what I think the negotiation should be.

513
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:46,931
[SPEAKER_24]: I can't even sit in and certainly I'm not on the other side of the table for me to actually negotiate that.

514
00:35:47,071 --> 00:35:59,214
[SPEAKER_24]: So it's a bad situation when it comes to the contracts and there are steps, there are different things that I would like to see tried that maybe could make movement on this.

515
00:35:59,814 --> 00:36:04,575
[SPEAKER_24]: But I don't think that voting down the budget or voting down other people's raises is gonna do that.

516
00:36:05,311 --> 00:36:07,832
[SPEAKER_07]: And while I still technically up for sorry.

517
00:36:09,173 --> 00:36:12,855
[SPEAKER_07]: I, I mean, I think, Vice President Bears.

518
00:36:12,875 --> 00:36:16,516
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of explained the what the debate that was happening in my head really well.

519
00:36:17,917 --> 00:36:21,538
[SPEAKER_07]: The first phone call I made when we started our budget process with the mayor.

520
00:36:22,319 --> 00:36:26,881
[SPEAKER_07]: This was before she submitted her budget to us the first thing I brought up was the clerical union.

521
00:36:27,501 --> 00:36:31,905
[SPEAKER_07]: and me wanting to see more something done on that front.

522
00:36:32,245 --> 00:36:34,907
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I've had a bunch of priorities, right?

523
00:36:35,487 --> 00:36:49,738
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, I still have to think about how I'm going to vote on the budget tonight, because there's some things I need to see, and I haven't seen yet, and some things that I wanted to see and have been there through good faith negotiations, right?

524
00:36:50,879 --> 00:36:51,500
[SPEAKER_07]: When I think about

525
00:36:52,901 --> 00:36:58,745
[SPEAKER_07]: potential effects of the budget, maybe there maybe there is a case for voting it down, I certainly do believe in that.

526
00:36:59,906 --> 00:37:10,774
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, I can't justify voting hurt everyone because it's an outcome that would eventually hurt everyone instead of, you know, just a little group of people like women.

527
00:37:12,015 --> 00:37:18,260
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that's that's, that's a very, that's a very grossly grossly false way of putting things but

528
00:37:19,286 --> 00:37:20,667
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the point has been made.

529
00:37:20,848 --> 00:37:23,931
[SPEAKER_02]: One other thing I need to say, excuse me, Georgia, just for one second, please.

530
00:37:25,012 --> 00:37:27,915
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want everybody to know especially the voters out there.

531
00:37:28,335 --> 00:37:35,622
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to talk about hot you want to talk about like, how we're supposed to be all working together and for each other and backing each other up.

532
00:37:36,403 --> 00:37:38,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Before Christmas, my mother broke her neck.

533
00:37:39,146 --> 00:37:42,689
[SPEAKER_02]: She fell at 87 years old and broke her neck.

534
00:37:43,931 --> 00:37:52,629
[SPEAKER_02]: I asked to be able to work from home three days a week and come in two days a week to do the job that I can't do from home.

535
00:37:52,649 --> 00:37:54,352
[SPEAKER_02]: I asked.

536
00:37:55,478 --> 00:37:59,139
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was told, no, there's no working from home allowed.

537
00:37:59,759 --> 00:38:02,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me, you wanna know how many people are working from home now?

538
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,040
[SPEAKER_02]: All non-union personnel.

539
00:38:05,861 --> 00:38:13,163
[SPEAKER_02]: You could have, somebody could have just looked at me with a little bit of sympathy and said, well, she's in the union, but this goes well beyond it.

540
00:38:14,103 --> 00:38:22,285
[SPEAKER_02]: This goes, having a house, having being a human being, we get slapped a million times and we keep getting up.

541
00:38:25,091 --> 00:38:27,072
[SPEAKER_02]: enough.

542
00:38:27,652 --> 00:38:33,413
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Madam President, I appreciate the time and I would just tell you know, everybody has their own opinions of what they have to do.

543
00:38:34,294 --> 00:38:36,594
[SPEAKER_16]: I too was a member of the negotiating team.

544
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:39,455
[SPEAKER_16]: As a union members in the school department.

545
00:38:39,915 --> 00:38:45,277
[SPEAKER_16]: I then battled for contracts for teachers as a city school committee member.

546
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:49,138
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm on the negotiating team municipality, neighbor community.

547
00:38:49,878 --> 00:38:52,920
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm a union member, my parents have been union members their whole lives.

548
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:58,623
[SPEAKER_16]: One thing we've always learned and we saw it play out right in front of us when the country was going to close.

549
00:38:59,344 --> 00:38:59,964
[SPEAKER_16]: And what happened?

550
00:39:00,585 --> 00:39:05,047
[SPEAKER_16]: Each party stood strong until they figured out what was best for what their needs were.

551
00:39:05,708 --> 00:39:06,748
[SPEAKER_16]: And here we are right now.

552
00:39:07,108 --> 00:39:17,595
[SPEAKER_16]: And we've all agreed behind this rail, that making sure fair labor practices, making sure that there's equitable, equitable pay when it comes to our non union or union employees.

553
00:39:18,854 --> 00:39:21,116
[SPEAKER_16]: I said that every single time a vote came up.

554
00:39:23,338 --> 00:39:30,224
[SPEAKER_16]: And if we stood strong, Amy, my belief, if we stood strong on the no's all the way through,

555
00:39:31,257 --> 00:39:35,299
[SPEAKER_16]: then it comes to the position where we have to do the right thing for everybody or nobody.

556
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:38,061
[SPEAKER_16]: So right now, this is why the city is so divided.

557
00:39:38,401 --> 00:39:46,986
[SPEAKER_16]: This is why morale, someone told me the other day when I mentioned it after I've talked to many different department heads, believe it or not, that morale here is terrible, and I can see why.

558
00:39:47,707 --> 00:39:52,730
[SPEAKER_16]: So all I can say is this, what my fellow councilors saying, they're not wrong.

559
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:54,831
[SPEAKER_16]: This is what it is.

560
00:39:54,891 --> 00:39:56,351
[SPEAKER_16]: This is our power.

561
00:39:56,711 --> 00:40:03,914
[SPEAKER_16]: But I will tell you, the power that we have today to vote yes and no for the contract, for the budget, just like we did last year.

562
00:40:05,755 --> 00:40:06,935
[SPEAKER_16]: Just like we did last year.

563
00:40:07,015 --> 00:40:08,976
[SPEAKER_16]: And we thought we won last year, right?

564
00:40:09,296 --> 00:40:13,318
[SPEAKER_16]: We thought we finally got what we needed to make this body work better.

565
00:40:13,638 --> 00:40:14,298
[SPEAKER_16]: And what happened?

566
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:16,959
[SPEAKER_16]: Not one promise was fulfilled.

567
00:40:16,979 --> 00:40:18,340
[SPEAKER_16]: Not one.

568
00:40:19,341 --> 00:40:22,624
[SPEAKER_16]: No different than what you're going through so this is going to be a very interesting evening tonight.

569
00:40:23,024 --> 00:40:38,558
[SPEAKER_16]: I think the community will see where we stand as a, as a council, where we stand and where we want the city to go, because if it's, if it's going to be, you know, pick and choose, like, it's being done on the city side with non union and dividing us.

570
00:40:39,693 --> 00:40:45,874
[SPEAKER_16]: If we're gonna see that here, then we're in a bad state for the next few years here, if that's gonna be the case, that stays the trend.

571
00:40:46,254 --> 00:40:51,956
[SPEAKER_16]: So I apologize and I told you that, and I appreciate you for coming up, I really do.

572
00:40:52,876 --> 00:40:57,797
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what, they have to see the people that it hurts, because I don't think people see, that's the other piece.

573
00:40:58,157 --> 00:41:02,258
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't have a newspaper, people don't see it every day, what they see is fluff.

574
00:41:03,089 --> 00:41:05,151
[SPEAKER_16]: A lot of people like to see the fluff and the happiness.

575
00:41:05,732 --> 00:41:07,573
[SPEAKER_16]: What they don't like to see is what's happening right now.

576
00:41:08,034 --> 00:41:13,619
[SPEAKER_16]: You standing up there and saying there are people, there are ladies, women behind you that work hard for the city that are hurting.

577
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:21,246
[SPEAKER_16]: So again, I just want you to know, I know the president has given us more than enough time to talk.

578
00:41:21,266 --> 00:41:22,047
[SPEAKER_16]: So we appreciate that.

579
00:41:22,087 --> 00:41:23,749
[SPEAKER_16]: But there's nothing else we can do.

580
00:41:23,809 --> 00:41:24,609
[SPEAKER_16]: So I apologize.

581
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:25,370
[SPEAKER_16]: And I appreciate it.

582
00:41:26,571 --> 00:41:27,012
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

583
00:41:27,392 --> 00:41:27,672
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

584
00:41:27,772 --> 00:41:28,433
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, thank you.

585
00:41:31,391 --> 00:41:33,612
[SPEAKER_08]: So anybody else for public participation at this time?

586
00:41:36,174 --> 00:41:39,276
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing none, we have papers under suspension.

587
00:41:39,496 --> 00:41:42,297
[SPEAKER_08]: Madam Chief, sorry, Mr. Murphy, sorry.

588
00:41:42,938 --> 00:41:44,799
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, well, we'll take Mr. Murphy and then Madam Chief of Staff.

589
00:41:44,959 --> 00:41:45,739
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

590
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:47,660
Okay.

591
00:41:48,041 --> 00:41:49,702
[SPEAKER_08]: Madam Chief of Staff.

592
00:41:51,118 --> 00:41:52,519
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you, President Morell.

593
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:58,141
[SPEAKER_36]: Just wanna state a number of different pieces.

594
00:41:58,161 --> 00:42:01,483
[SPEAKER_36]: There were a lot of different statements that were made, a number of them, I think.

595
00:42:02,731 --> 00:42:23,471
[SPEAKER_36]: might have been mischaracterizations of what has occurred over a period of time and I, I understand that there are frustrations this contract that's in discussion has been open since 2019 I understand that you know I think we all understand that something that we want to resolve we are presently in mediation to resolve the mayor myself or human resources director, sorry.

596
00:42:24,031 --> 00:42:24,671
[SPEAKER_08]: you can't hear.

597
00:42:24,791 --> 00:42:25,532
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you lean?

598
00:42:25,552 --> 00:42:26,132
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

599
00:42:26,652 --> 00:42:27,853
[SPEAKER_08]: Managers are killing near the mic.

600
00:42:27,933 --> 00:42:29,013
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't certainly is this better?

601
00:42:29,033 --> 00:42:29,653
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's better.

602
00:42:30,014 --> 00:42:30,314
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.

603
00:42:30,894 --> 00:42:33,575
[SPEAKER_36]: Um, so I'll just quickly summarize.

604
00:42:33,615 --> 00:42:45,300
[SPEAKER_36]: I was just saying that there are a number of, um, pieces that I think are mischaracterizations, but I also want to acknowledge and understand and are the mayor myself and the human resources director.

605
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:50,182
[SPEAKER_36]: We're all working towards trying to resolve this open contract that's been open since 2019.

606
00:42:50,222 --> 00:42:50,262
[SPEAKER_36]: Um

607
00:42:52,863 --> 00:42:58,049
[SPEAKER_36]: I truly and honestly, I mean, we've we've been at mediation, the three of us.

608
00:42:58,469 --> 00:43:00,571
[SPEAKER_36]: So we are at the negotiating table.

609
00:43:01,052 --> 00:43:02,734
[SPEAKER_36]: Mediation is a unique process.

610
00:43:02,934 --> 00:43:07,398
[SPEAKER_36]: I can't to preserve the process, the integrity of negotiations.

611
00:43:07,819 --> 00:43:11,202
[SPEAKER_36]: I'm advised not to comment on the details of those things.

612
00:43:11,242 --> 00:43:14,305
[SPEAKER_36]: I don't think this is the proper forum to get into the details of it.

613
00:43:15,026 --> 00:43:15,886
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor, do you have a question?

614
00:43:15,906 --> 00:43:24,651
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm just a little confused as to what leads us to mediation, because usually you go to mediation when you no longer can sit at the table anymore and make any forward progress, right?

615
00:43:24,671 --> 00:43:27,972
[SPEAKER_32]: So mediation means you're at a stalemate at this point in time, right?

616
00:43:28,032 --> 00:43:31,254
[SPEAKER_32]: You've reached what's called an impasse, is the negotiating term.

617
00:43:31,514 --> 00:43:35,496
[SPEAKER_32]: You've reached an impasse in negotiations, and we can no longer move further or backwards.

618
00:43:35,836 --> 00:43:43,900
[SPEAKER_32]: So my question is, if you're working with these unions and these employee groups, how have we gotten to a point where at impasse with multiple groups, if in fact we are working with them?

619
00:43:44,684 --> 00:43:50,808
[SPEAKER_32]: Because it doesn't make sense to me if we're going to mediation to a third party negotiator, a third party to handle our negotiations, right?

620
00:43:50,928 --> 00:43:53,049
[SPEAKER_32]: Outside person, right?

621
00:43:53,609 --> 00:43:58,272
[SPEAKER_32]: Through mediation because we reached impasse, that doesn't sound to me like the definition of working together with somebody.

622
00:43:58,292 --> 00:44:03,735
[SPEAKER_32]: So I'd just like to get a response from the chief of staff because she always likes to answer questions and provide points of information.

623
00:44:03,755 --> 00:44:06,017
[SPEAKER_32]: So I'd like to ask the chief of staff, what got us to this point?

624
00:44:06,137 --> 00:44:10,860
[SPEAKER_32]: Why are we at a point of impasse when these contracts have been open now since this administration got elected?

625
00:44:11,462 --> 00:44:12,102
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you Councilor Knight.

626
00:44:12,642 --> 00:44:14,703
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you President Morell through you to Councilor Knight.

627
00:44:15,623 --> 00:44:24,205
[SPEAKER_36]: So the timeline on this particular contract and at least one other contract is, again, 2019, we had a pandemic.

628
00:44:25,505 --> 00:44:32,747
[SPEAKER_36]: This unit has changed representation twice I think that's important to note here, and I'm not certainly not saying that that's their fault.

629
00:44:32,807 --> 00:44:38,468
[SPEAKER_36]: I have whatever the union wants to do to have representation is perfectly fine for the city.

630
00:44:39,068 --> 00:44:46,332
[SPEAKER_36]: But administratively, what that does to the process is we cannot negotiate while they're going through a process to go through a change.

631
00:44:47,093 --> 00:44:49,914
[SPEAKER_36]: In 2021 and 2022, there were two changes.

632
00:44:50,375 --> 00:44:55,818
[SPEAKER_36]: First, they changed to Feinberg, Dumont, and Brennan as representation, and then they changed to the Teamsters.

633
00:44:56,358 --> 00:45:01,862
[SPEAKER_36]: Those changes caused unintentional delays to the process.

634
00:45:02,302 --> 00:45:05,844
[SPEAKER_32]: My question is this, is Feinberg, Dumont, and Brennan an employee organization?

635
00:45:06,104 --> 00:45:06,404
[SPEAKER_32]: they're not.

636
00:45:06,584 --> 00:45:08,946
[SPEAKER_32]: And Feinberg, Dumont, and Brennan is a law office.

637
00:45:08,966 --> 00:45:10,667
[SPEAKER_32]: They're a law office that also works with Local 25.

638
00:45:10,767 --> 00:45:11,827
[SPEAKER_32]: All right.

639
00:45:11,867 --> 00:45:16,950
[SPEAKER_32]: So the way that this works is if you're going to decertify from a union, they're a member of the SEIU and they want to decertify.

640
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:19,331
[SPEAKER_32]: You can't decertify when your contract is active.

641
00:45:19,772 --> 00:45:23,494
[SPEAKER_32]: So what happens was the union said, we're going to decertify from SEIU.

642
00:45:23,614 --> 00:45:24,014
[SPEAKER_32]: And they did.

643
00:45:24,174 --> 00:45:29,117
[SPEAKER_32]: And they picked up private representation because there's a cooling off period that's necessary before they can apply with another union.

644
00:45:30,410 --> 00:45:35,898
[SPEAKER_32]: But nothing precluded them from going to the table and negotiating once they decertified from SEIU and once that contract was open.

645
00:45:36,172 --> 00:45:36,412
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.

646
00:45:36,432 --> 00:45:36,812
[SPEAKER_36]: That's right.

647
00:45:36,932 --> 00:45:37,772
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you, President Morell.

648
00:45:37,952 --> 00:45:44,253
[SPEAKER_36]: And we continue to have negotiations when we, when we understood that the clerical union was represented by the law firm.

649
00:45:44,613 --> 00:45:47,594
[SPEAKER_36]: But then we understood that they were going through another petition change.

650
00:45:47,894 --> 00:45:51,055
[SPEAKER_36]: So these things do have a way of affecting timelines.

651
00:45:51,555 --> 00:45:54,455
[SPEAKER_36]: So I think that's important for everyone to know and have that in the back of their minds.

652
00:45:55,315 --> 00:45:59,136
[SPEAKER_32]: Madam President, I just like to know what the timeline is.

653
00:45:59,636 --> 00:46:00,696
[SPEAKER_32]: I just like to know what the timeline is.

654
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:01,576
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm just asking a question.

655
00:46:02,257 --> 00:46:02,717
[SPEAKER_08]: Let her finish.

656
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:06,240
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you, President Morell.

657
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:15,402
[SPEAKER_36]: Um, on June 30th, we're scheduled for another mediation session, and I will say during these mediation sessions, well, first and foremost, the union filed for mediation.

658
00:46:15,422 --> 00:46:17,762
[SPEAKER_36]: The city didn't file for mediation, but I have no none.

659
00:46:17,822 --> 00:46:20,283
[SPEAKER_36]: None of us have any issue with the union filing for mediation.

660
00:46:20,323 --> 00:46:24,644
[SPEAKER_36]: It's helpful sometimes to have another party come in and observe this matter again.

661
00:46:24,924 --> 00:46:30,005
[SPEAKER_36]: I really do not want to get into a situation where I'm attempting to speak to actual terms because I think

662
00:46:30,425 --> 00:46:33,048
[SPEAKER_36]: It's a slippery slope and we're just going to be here all night on something like that.

663
00:46:33,989 --> 00:46:37,373
[SPEAKER_36]: But happy to discuss with anyone individually on the council on those matters.

664
00:46:38,234 --> 00:46:44,341
[SPEAKER_36]: And obviously as far as the union is concerned, we're happy to have mediation on June 30 and discuss the matter further.

665
00:46:45,622 --> 00:47:00,934
[SPEAKER_36]: Um, a number of other things were stated, um, but I think it was clearly stated that a number of the raises that were essentially received by a non-union staff were 2%, 2%, and 2%, so I think that was made clear.

666
00:47:00,994 --> 00:47:01,374
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.

667
00:47:01,714 --> 00:47:04,776
[SPEAKER_36]: I don't know exactly the discussion that was occurring when I first walked in.

668
00:47:04,816 --> 00:47:05,977
[SPEAKER_36]: I apologize for being late.

669
00:47:05,997 --> 00:47:07,298
[SPEAKER_36]: I was about five minutes late.

670
00:47:07,879 --> 00:47:13,103
[SPEAKER_36]: Um, it may have something to do with a misunderstanding as far as a unit, as far as the

671
00:47:13,783 --> 00:47:15,467
[SPEAKER_36]: certain positions in the DPW is concerned.

672
00:47:15,487 --> 00:47:17,130
[SPEAKER_36]: If there is, I'm happy to answer the question.

673
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:18,513
[SPEAKER_36]: I just need to know what the question was.

674
00:47:20,377 --> 00:47:22,942
[SPEAKER_36]: And generally,

675
00:47:27,449 --> 00:47:45,475
[SPEAKER_36]: There's a lot of misconceptions that were stated, and I couldn't go through each and every one of them, but to be clear, the mayor disclosed that when she presented the non-union COLAs, that she was not, she put it before the council and she disclosed and disclaimed that that was something that this council could decide upon.

676
00:47:45,515 --> 00:47:50,657
[SPEAKER_36]: And this council decided not to adjust the mayor's salary and its own salary, which is perfectly fine.

677
00:47:50,777 --> 00:47:52,638
[SPEAKER_36]: And I think it's a,

678
00:47:54,104 --> 00:47:55,345
[SPEAKER_32]: point of information that men present.

679
00:47:55,906 --> 00:48:11,421
[SPEAKER_32]: I do believe the council asked for a legal opinion as to whether or not that paper was posed with an and sound ethical footing, because what happened was the mayor asked the council to actually approve its own raise and erase for herself in the same year that they perceive it, we never received a response to that so if Nina could follow up on that, that would be good.

680
00:48:11,981 --> 00:48:12,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

681
00:48:12,742 --> 00:48:13,583
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Madam Chief staff.

682
00:48:15,805 --> 00:48:16,606
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Murphy, did you want to.

683
00:48:18,048 --> 00:48:19,469
[SPEAKER_32]: question Madam President on that.

684
00:48:19,609 --> 00:48:26,671
[SPEAKER_32]: Can you just tell me who represents the city in the collective bargaining sessions can the chief of staff tell you who represents the city.

685
00:48:27,472 --> 00:48:28,952
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that your question if the chief of staff can.

686
00:48:29,633 --> 00:48:32,854
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, yeah, whoever that's her name Yeah, that'd be fine.

687
00:48:34,715 --> 00:48:36,435
[SPEAKER_32]: Who represents who represents the city.

688
00:48:36,595 --> 00:48:41,057
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm asking you just to address her by her title you don't need to respond saying if that's her name, Madam Chief of Staff.

689
00:48:44,568 --> 00:48:46,930
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you President Morell through you to Councilor Knight.

690
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:55,355
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes, the city has special labor council through KP law that represents the city in union negotiations from time to time.

691
00:48:55,915 --> 00:48:56,256
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.

692
00:48:56,576 --> 00:49:04,181
[SPEAKER_32]: And just on that note, Madam President, the administration's well aware of city ordinance section 2-680.

693
00:49:04,281 --> 00:49:04,801
[SPEAKER_32]: Right.

694
00:49:06,742 --> 00:49:06,962
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay.

695
00:49:07,283 --> 00:49:13,847
[SPEAKER_32]: And part of that ordinance does read that the chief of staff shall be responsible for representing the mayor and I'll collect the bargaining sessions.

696
00:49:15,973 --> 00:49:18,197
[SPEAKER_32]: Is the Chief of Staff employed by KP Law?

697
00:49:20,681 --> 00:49:21,703
[SPEAKER_32]: Is the Chief of Staff KP Law?

698
00:49:21,957 --> 00:49:22,497
[SPEAKER_36]: Madam President.

699
00:49:23,217 --> 00:49:23,778
[SPEAKER_36]: Madam Chief Staff.

700
00:49:23,878 --> 00:49:24,178
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.

701
00:49:24,278 --> 00:49:31,620
[SPEAKER_36]: I don't have the ordinance in front of me, but my reading of the ordinance is that that ordinance allows the chief of staff to determine the representatives.

702
00:49:32,661 --> 00:49:34,181
[SPEAKER_36]: Again, that's my reading of the ordinance.

703
00:49:34,601 --> 00:49:38,743
[SPEAKER_36]: That does not necessarily mean that the chief of staff needs to be at the negotiating table.

704
00:49:38,843 --> 00:49:42,644
[SPEAKER_36]: And for the record, I stepped away from the negotiating table for a period of time.

705
00:49:43,144 --> 00:49:49,346
[SPEAKER_36]: I am back in active negotiations that may or may not include me physically at the negotiating table.

706
00:49:49,867 --> 00:49:50,047
[SPEAKER_36]: But

707
00:49:51,367 --> 00:49:55,548
[SPEAKER_36]: I am certainly working on those matters and also with our Human Resources Director.

708
00:49:56,249 --> 00:49:56,829
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

709
00:49:56,849 --> 00:50:04,471
[SPEAKER_32]: Madam President, on that point, the Chief of Staff is wrong in her reading of the ordinance because that was not the legislative intent.

710
00:50:05,031 --> 00:50:09,352
[SPEAKER_32]: And I can speak to that personally because I voted for it in 2016 when it came up.

711
00:50:10,133 --> 00:50:11,493
[SPEAKER_32]: I was a part of this body at that time.

712
00:50:14,215 --> 00:50:17,537
[SPEAKER_32]: So a reading of it is incorrect and is not in line with the legislative intent.

713
00:50:17,877 --> 00:50:22,480
[SPEAKER_32]: And I think that any other member of this council that was on the body in 2016 can also concur with that.

714
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:28,984
[SPEAKER_32]: All right, so the way I'm looking at this now is we have an essential function and essential duty of the chief of staff that's been taken away.

715
00:50:30,125 --> 00:50:37,530
[SPEAKER_32]: The salary is still $135,000, but an essential function, essential duty has been taken away and it's been farmed out to a third party, private third party law firm.

716
00:50:39,602 --> 00:50:40,202
[SPEAKER_32]: That's an expense.

717
00:50:41,043 --> 00:50:48,406
[SPEAKER_32]: So when we sit down and we talk about why the council needs a city solicitor, it's to control these expenses and these wasteful spending habits that this administration has.

718
00:50:49,766 --> 00:51:00,650
[SPEAKER_32]: So when we look at the chief of staff's title in the ordinance that supports the job that you're supposed to do, and we'll go through it, the majority of the duties have been taken away, but yet the salary remains the same.

719
00:51:03,612 --> 00:51:08,574
[SPEAKER_32]: So when I hear members of our clerical union get up here and quite frankly,

720
00:51:09,758 --> 00:51:28,828
[SPEAKER_32]: properly express dissatisfaction and disgust because they've been out of the contract for 48 months and then listen to the chief of staff come up here and try to explain our way out of the fact that it's because they're not able to sit down at the table and negotiate properly and then try to spin it by saying that they're precluded from doing it when I know for a fact they're not.

721
00:51:29,488 --> 00:51:30,909
[SPEAKER_32]: It's just bizarre to me, Madam President.

722
00:51:31,009 --> 00:51:33,570
[SPEAKER_32]: And I feel like what it is is it's for the cameras and it's not for us.

723
00:51:35,311 --> 00:51:38,593
[SPEAKER_32]: And it's to portray a picture and control a narrative that's not a reality.

724
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:41,301
[SPEAKER_32]: So that's where I am with this.

725
00:51:41,421 --> 00:51:52,887
[SPEAKER_32]: I thank the chief of staff and president of the clerical union, Mr. Naglia, for being up here this evening and sharing with us their insight on such an important topic in the community.

726
00:51:53,247 --> 00:52:00,470
[SPEAKER_32]: And I am going to what I'd call use my reasonable deduction to determine who's being more truthful than not.

727
00:52:01,891 --> 00:52:05,953
[SPEAKER_36]: President Morell, I don't think any of that requires a response from me, so I'm going to respond.

728
00:52:06,133 --> 00:52:07,254
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, thank you, Madam Chief of Staff.

729
00:52:08,094 --> 00:52:08,975
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Murphy, you're almost here.

730
00:52:13,854 --> 00:52:15,815
[SPEAKER_08]: name and address to the record, please the heck of a night.

731
00:52:16,835 --> 00:52:21,577
[SPEAKER_42]: Chris Murphy, President, Medford senior football associates, if you want to have.

732
00:52:24,478 --> 00:52:29,180
[SPEAKER_42]: I am up here just to give a sent the thing to the school committee so I just wanted to

733
00:52:30,683 --> 00:52:34,106
[SPEAKER_42]: come talk to you guys just to have more eyes on some of the stuff we're going to be doing this summer.

734
00:52:34,126 --> 00:52:36,187
[SPEAKER_42]: We have two big events coming up.

735
00:52:36,988 --> 00:52:38,909
[SPEAKER_42]: The last time I saw you guys was in November.

736
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:41,171
[SPEAKER_42]: So it's good to see you all again.

737
00:52:42,212 --> 00:52:43,813
[SPEAKER_42]: We have had been a pretty busy

738
00:52:45,922 --> 00:52:49,846
[SPEAKER_42]: year wise, you know, it seems like football has become like a 12 month thing.

739
00:52:49,866 --> 00:53:00,135
[SPEAKER_42]: You know, we've done a lot of community events this past winter, we did community cleanup day, we did grave decoration, and we just helped the Medford and Chelsea Kiwanis last week pack 10,000 meals.

740
00:53:02,727 --> 00:53:09,912
[SPEAKER_42]: which was as soon as the kids kind of turned into a little competition and went crazy with packing meals.

741
00:53:09,952 --> 00:53:12,254
[SPEAKER_42]: But we've had a great off season.

742
00:53:12,274 --> 00:53:15,176
[SPEAKER_42]: Just wanted to come up here and talk about two events we're having in the summer.

743
00:53:15,196 --> 00:53:17,058
[SPEAKER_42]: July 14th, Friday at 5 p.m.

744
00:53:20,233 --> 00:53:21,774
[SPEAKER_42]: We're dubbing it the event of the summer.

745
00:53:21,974 --> 00:53:24,334
[SPEAKER_42]: We're going to be doing the first annual blue and white game.

746
00:53:25,175 --> 00:53:39,560
[SPEAKER_42]: It's going to be a flag football game where the team is going to team up with separate team with joint teams of the Medford Police and Fire Department to do a friendly flag football game.

747
00:53:40,925 --> 00:53:49,913
[SPEAKER_42]: uh, to get the kids, um, Build a little part, uh, build on our partnership with those 22 entities right now.

748
00:53:49,933 --> 00:53:52,335
[SPEAKER_42]: Uh, the game will be at Hormel Stadium.

749
00:53:53,295 --> 00:53:54,216
[SPEAKER_42]: It is open to the public.

750
00:53:54,717 --> 00:53:59,400
[SPEAKER_42]: We're asking for $5 donation from people that help help benefit the team.

751
00:54:00,081 --> 00:54:01,722
[SPEAKER_42]: You're all more than welcome to come.

752
00:54:02,083 --> 00:54:06,686
[SPEAKER_42]: And if you guys want to play a couple snaps, be my guest.

753
00:54:07,667 --> 00:54:08,468
[SPEAKER_42]: We'll get you a T shirt.

754
00:54:08,488 --> 00:54:09,549
[SPEAKER_42]: We'll get you some flags and

755
00:54:10,896 --> 00:54:11,836
[SPEAKER_42]: we'll have a little bit of fun.

756
00:54:13,677 --> 00:54:22,860
[SPEAKER_42]: The other event we are pushing right now is this year is the 85th anniversary of Medford becoming the Mustangs.

757
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:25,801
[SPEAKER_42]: So we're trying to do a series of events.

758
00:54:27,056 --> 00:54:29,317
[SPEAKER_42]: throughout the summer and season.

759
00:54:30,177 --> 00:54:52,008
[SPEAKER_42]: So we've been asking the public to, if they have any photos, old videos, old, anything cool that they want to share that, you know, we've been trying to do Facebook posts every day to get some cool info and stuff that, you know, even I didn't know existed, but,

760
00:54:53,850 --> 00:54:57,751
[SPEAKER_42]: If you do our Facebook page, just message us what you have my emails on there.

761
00:54:57,771 --> 00:55:01,232
[SPEAKER_42]: Yeah, I appreciate your time.

762
00:55:01,252 --> 00:55:02,872
[SPEAKER_42]: It's tough.

763
00:55:02,892 --> 00:55:08,433
[SPEAKER_42]: We don't have a newspaper, but I know a lot of people watch this and I was appreciate that you guys let me come up here.

764
00:55:08,914 --> 00:55:10,514
[SPEAKER_16]: Madam President.

765
00:55:10,614 --> 00:55:11,314
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

766
00:55:11,794 --> 00:55:15,395
[SPEAKER_16]: Chris, again, I want to take the time to I know we expressed it as a council.

767
00:55:16,072 --> 00:55:19,034
[SPEAKER_16]: to thank the Football Association and the high school football team.

768
00:55:19,555 --> 00:55:36,167
[SPEAKER_16]: But whenever you think you guys are done, what I saw, what I saw and what I heard with the Kiwanians and feeding the, helping with the food insecurities and working together with Chelsea and making sure that again, Medford stood above it.

769
00:55:36,488 --> 00:55:43,073
[SPEAKER_16]: So again, I want to applaud the members of your team and the coach and staff for really

770
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:47,672
[SPEAKER_16]: really looking at what being a high school athlete is truly all about.

771
00:55:47,732 --> 00:55:53,635
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not, you know, if we looked at the wins and losses, that's, that's pretty small way of looking at this process.

772
00:55:54,235 --> 00:56:00,378
[SPEAKER_16]: But the way that this football team, our football team brings so much pride to this community.

773
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:06,662
[SPEAKER_16]: And for me personally, um, I just have to applaud the association coach Curly and his staff.

774
00:56:06,722 --> 00:56:10,904
[SPEAKER_16]: And most importantly, the kids in that team, cause they, they really, um,

775
00:56:12,094 --> 00:56:16,879
[SPEAKER_16]: really standing above and showing what true superstars they are.

776
00:56:16,919 --> 00:56:18,260
[SPEAKER_16]: So again, thank you very much for that.

777
00:56:18,281 --> 00:56:24,046
[SPEAKER_42]: Well, I can't echo how awesome Coach Curley has been making these kids great citizens.

778
00:56:25,768 --> 00:56:26,669
[SPEAKER_42]: John wanted to be here tonight.

779
00:56:26,709 --> 00:56:28,351
[SPEAKER_42]: He had family stuff to do.

780
00:56:28,451 --> 00:56:30,253
[SPEAKER_42]: So he sent me but

781
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:41,117
[SPEAKER_42]: I think the best way I can say is I don't know if you remember this, but 23 years ago, the day before Thanksgiving, you came up and talked to us.

782
00:56:41,137 --> 00:56:41,677
[SPEAKER_42]: I did.

783
00:56:41,757 --> 00:56:44,258
[SPEAKER_42]: I don't know if you remember what you said, but I'll share it.

784
00:56:44,898 --> 00:56:47,740
[SPEAKER_42]: You know, just because you put on a blue and white shirt doesn't make you a Mustang.

785
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:48,700
[SPEAKER_42]: You have to earn it.

786
00:56:48,801 --> 00:56:49,241
[SPEAKER_42]: You have to

787
00:56:50,731 --> 00:57:04,662
[SPEAKER_42]: you know, get out your, your not only athletes, but your students and your citizens and we take that's something that we strive on and something that we have instilled in these kids and these kids have take that take that the heart and

788
00:57:05,891 --> 00:57:11,035
[SPEAKER_42]: I think they've gone above and beyond being great citizens in this community.

789
00:57:12,516 --> 00:57:19,001
[SPEAKER_42]: We're proud of the kids who've graduated and how they've gone and given back to the community.

790
00:57:19,041 --> 00:57:27,648
[SPEAKER_42]: I can't say enough about the fine young men and women we have on the Nifflin High School football team.

791
00:57:29,517 --> 00:57:30,398
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

792
00:57:30,658 --> 00:57:31,498
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Madam President.

793
00:57:31,538 --> 00:57:34,981
[SPEAKER_10]: Chris, thank you and Coach Curley for all the help you did the other night.

794
00:57:36,102 --> 00:57:40,345
[SPEAKER_10]: They packed up 10,000 meals for people in the community.

795
00:57:40,625 --> 00:57:42,766
[SPEAKER_10]: And the benefactor of that was the St.

796
00:57:42,826 --> 00:57:44,007
[SPEAKER_10]: Rayfield's Food Pantry.

797
00:57:44,347 --> 00:57:44,828
[SPEAKER_10]: Excellent.

798
00:57:44,908 --> 00:57:46,209
[SPEAKER_10]: So they thank you very much.

799
00:57:46,929 --> 00:57:49,431
[SPEAKER_10]: And we unpacked all those boxes on Thursday morning over there.

800
00:57:49,891 --> 00:57:53,434
[SPEAKER_10]: But again, it means a lot to wear the blue and white in this community.

801
00:57:53,794 --> 00:57:54,034
[SPEAKER_42]: Oh, yeah.

802
00:57:54,114 --> 00:57:56,776
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, it's not just winning or losing.

803
00:57:56,876 --> 00:57:57,397
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a spirit.

804
00:57:57,817 --> 00:57:59,018
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been part of that spirit my whole life.

805
00:57:59,639 --> 00:58:01,780
[SPEAKER_10]: My family's been by the spirit my whole life.

806
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:04,081
[SPEAKER_10]: And I thank you for being by the spirit your whole life.

807
00:58:04,901 --> 00:58:12,124
[SPEAKER_42]: But I think I think you would, you'd say the while back, you know, we've lost a lot of great people in the last year or two.

808
00:58:12,224 --> 00:58:16,766
[SPEAKER_42]: And you've said, who's going to be there to kind of pick that up.

809
00:58:16,846 --> 00:58:17,867
[SPEAKER_42]: And thank you.

810
00:58:17,907 --> 00:58:20,008
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm happy to say that, you know, as long as I'm

811
00:58:21,519 --> 00:58:22,599
[SPEAKER_42]: my children a lot.

812
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:27,921
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll be, uh, and you certainly stepped up for some of the people that we've lost over the years.

813
00:58:27,941 --> 00:58:28,081
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

814
00:58:28,141 --> 00:58:37,043
[SPEAKER_42]: I mean, it's, those are some, some, um, yeah, I've, I've learned, I've got great, great mentors and I'm glad that we're putting that on a new generation of people.

815
00:58:37,163 --> 00:58:37,443
[SPEAKER_42]: I know.

816
00:58:37,463 --> 00:58:44,265
[SPEAKER_42]: And, uh, like the other night, I mean, the second the guy said, Oh, this table's done this many boxes.

817
00:58:44,345 --> 00:58:46,666
[SPEAKER_42]: I, you know, the kids we had kind of just said, Oh no, no.

818
00:58:46,846 --> 00:58:47,086
[SPEAKER_42]: And they,

819
00:58:49,373 --> 00:58:57,895
[SPEAKER_42]: If there was like a packaging firm that saw how these kids would all have jobs by the end of that night, I think these kids finished with the first table to finish by like 45 minutes.

820
00:58:57,995 --> 00:59:01,997
[SPEAKER_42]: So like they, you know, they turned into a little competition.

821
00:59:02,037 --> 00:59:04,457
[SPEAKER_42]: And at the same time, they, like I said, they were able to.

822
00:59:04,717 --> 00:59:07,758
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a good night and they did and they deserve accolades.

823
00:59:07,918 --> 00:59:09,098
[SPEAKER_10]: All of them that were there.

824
00:59:09,539 --> 00:59:14,680
[SPEAKER_10]: And Chris, thank you for stepping up and thank you for stepping up to help the community also.

825
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:17,081
[SPEAKER_42]: I said I hope to see you guys July, July 14th and.

826
00:59:19,107 --> 00:59:19,867
[SPEAKER_42]: Let me know if you want to play.

827
00:59:19,887 --> 00:59:21,968
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

828
00:59:22,008 --> 00:59:22,729
[SPEAKER_08]: And thank you for sharing that.

829
00:59:22,749 --> 00:59:30,753
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, going to papers under suspension 23-337 offered by Councilor Scarpelli.

830
00:59:31,333 --> 00:59:39,957
[SPEAKER_08]: Be it so resolved, the Medford City Council sends deepest condolences to the family of Fred Rita, a longtime Medford resident and volunteer for the Medford Youth and United Soccer Programs.

831
00:59:40,057 --> 00:59:40,798
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scarpelli.

832
00:59:41,238 --> 00:59:42,578
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Madam President.

833
00:59:43,959 --> 00:59:46,120
[SPEAKER_16]: Some tragic news.

834
00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:47,861
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, when Chris brings up

835
00:59:48,598 --> 00:59:50,799
[SPEAKER_16]: people that have given to our community.

836
00:59:50,819 --> 01:00:05,847
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a gentleman who kids grew up in Medford, coached his youngest son, watched Freddy Rita give back to the kids in the community.

837
01:00:06,668 --> 01:00:14,072
[SPEAKER_16]: And when people weren't supposed to give to this much time and effort for certain type of kids,

838
01:00:15,296 --> 01:00:20,640
[SPEAKER_16]: Freddie would go and find the kids that couldn't afford a pair of cleats, or a pair of shin guards.

839
01:00:21,441 --> 01:00:26,905
[SPEAKER_16]: And he would make sure that he would buy those cleats and buy those shin guards, and then he'd put them on a team.

840
01:00:27,806 --> 01:00:36,313
[SPEAKER_16]: And then when at the time there was, you know, this infighting with method you soccer, and some people thought that kids in need really weren't

841
01:00:36,854 --> 01:00:45,783
[SPEAKER_16]: getting the attention they deserve, Freddie and some others, dedicated members of the community, decided to start a new league called Method United.

842
01:00:45,963 --> 01:00:50,969
[SPEAKER_16]: And they did that, not because of ego, but to make sure every kid was represented.

843
01:00:52,030 --> 01:00:53,972
[SPEAKER_16]: And it worked.

844
01:00:54,990 --> 01:01:03,593
[SPEAKER_16]: And what happened after a few years, that group then became, came together again as a true Method youth soccer organization that we see today.

845
01:01:03,613 --> 01:01:12,295
[SPEAKER_16]: A true vision of what the demographic of what Method truly looks like.

846
01:01:12,595 --> 01:01:14,016
[SPEAKER_16]: The canvas that is Medford.

847
01:01:14,856 --> 01:01:22,839
[SPEAKER_16]: And Freddie's love for the game of soccer and Freddie's passion to help kids was evident.

848
01:01:23,299 --> 01:01:32,142
[SPEAKER_16]: Freddie's a great story because I saw him a few weeks ago at a baseball game and we were talking and I didn't realize Freddie was an orphan.

849
01:01:33,342 --> 01:01:39,164
[SPEAKER_16]: And I said, there's no way that an orphan has the ability to raise such an amazing family.

850
01:01:39,184 --> 01:01:39,885
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's what he did.

851
01:01:40,905 --> 01:01:43,506
[SPEAKER_16]: He raised amazing children and

852
01:01:44,554 --> 01:01:47,655
[SPEAKER_16]: His wife, Adele, is just one of the best people that I've ever met.

853
01:01:48,075 --> 01:01:53,656
[SPEAKER_16]: And unfortunately, Freddy lost his life mowing his lawn.

854
01:01:55,397 --> 01:02:00,918
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's something that I know my family, myself, we're gonna miss Freddy.

855
01:02:01,578 --> 01:02:02,398
[SPEAKER_16]: He was very special.

856
01:02:03,038 --> 01:02:05,699
[SPEAKER_16]: And we send our condolences to his family.

857
01:02:05,759 --> 01:02:07,339
[SPEAKER_16]: He was one of the great ones.

858
01:02:07,479 --> 01:02:08,220
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you.

859
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:09,820
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

860
01:02:11,576 --> 01:02:15,759
[SPEAKER_08]: On a motion of Council Scarpelli, just speak please Madam President.

861
01:02:15,799 --> 01:02:18,780
[SPEAKER_32]: I just like to join Council Scarpelli and offer my condolences.

862
01:02:19,001 --> 01:02:31,148
[SPEAKER_32]: Although I didn't know Fred, as well as George that I do remember him from a very young age, when I was involved in Methodist soccer, and I also had the opportunity to go to college with the sun Steve, and what a good kid.

863
01:02:33,309 --> 01:02:34,449
[SPEAKER_32]: Freddie Rita was just a nice guy.

864
01:02:34,529 --> 01:02:35,089
[SPEAKER_32]: You know what I mean?

865
01:02:35,229 --> 01:02:36,850
[SPEAKER_32]: George hit the nail right on the head.

866
01:02:36,890 --> 01:02:47,054
[SPEAKER_32]: He was someone that wasn't afraid to put himself, put the community before himself and put himself out there to do the work, roll up his sleeves, get dirty and not seek an ounce of credit for it.

867
01:02:47,574 --> 01:02:48,295
[SPEAKER_32]: He was a great man.

868
01:02:48,795 --> 01:02:49,975
[SPEAKER_32]: Like you said, great family.

869
01:02:50,195 --> 01:02:54,377
[SPEAKER_29]: And I joined my council colleague and extending my deep condolences to the family.

870
01:02:55,060 --> 01:02:55,700
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it comes tonight.

871
01:02:56,441 --> 01:02:59,343
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli seconded by Councilor Knight all those in favor.

872
01:02:59,363 --> 01:03:02,384
[SPEAKER_08]: I suppose motion passes please rise for a moment of silence.

873
01:03:18,593 --> 01:03:47,151
[SPEAKER_08]: 23-336 offered under suspension by Councilor Tseng, Vice President Bears, and Councilor Collins, whereas the city of Medford is enriched by welcoming people from all walks of life, and whereas the month of June is nationally recognized as Pride Month to affirm the dignity, equality, and importance of LGBTQ plus people, be it therefore so resolved that the Medford City Council recognizes, affirms, and celebrates Pride Month, and be it further resolved that the Medford City Council stands in solidarity with the LGBTQ plus community during Pride Month and throughout the year.

874
01:03:47,671 --> 01:03:50,202
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Tseng, Thank you, President morale.

875
01:03:51,903 --> 01:03:59,770
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so happy and heartened to see our community come together and celebrate Pride Month in the ways that we have this year and last year.

876
01:04:00,891 --> 01:04:16,545
[SPEAKER_07]: We're truly, I think, embracing and owning it as a city, but I think we would be remiss not to mention the pain that the LGBTQ plus community has been going through in recent years with attacks to them, their dignity and their equality.

877
01:04:18,266 --> 01:04:27,712
[SPEAKER_07]: when it comes to what's being said in social media, when it comes to inappropriate accusations that are grounded in no reality.

878
01:04:27,732 --> 01:04:44,103
[SPEAKER_07]: These things, they might seem like national things that are only happening on a national level or in different states, but we've seen these things in the metropolitan schools where there was an incident and on social media this week with regards to the city of Medford and our celebration of pride.

879
01:04:46,073 --> 01:04:59,839
[SPEAKER_07]: This resolution is really offered as a way to for us on here on the Medford City Council to say that we stand with our LGBTQ plus community, that we want them to feel accepted and at home here in Medford and safe.

880
01:05:00,719 --> 01:05:00,959
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

881
01:05:03,697 --> 01:05:22,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, President Morell and I thank my fellow colleagues for joining with me in this resolution and I want to thank everybody in Medford who reached out to us over the past couple days to advocate for making sure that the spirit of pride and the flag of pride and the celebration of pride is, you know, echoes ever more loudly from City Hall.

882
01:05:23,774 --> 01:05:26,617
[SPEAKER_05]: It's important every month of the year to let it be known that

883
01:05:27,796 --> 01:05:30,718
[SPEAKER_05]: people of all walks of life, especially people who are celebrating Pride Month.

884
01:05:31,659 --> 01:05:32,499
[SPEAKER_05]: We're glad you're here.

885
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:33,180
[SPEAKER_05]: We support you.

886
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:46,589
[SPEAKER_05]: We want you to live your best and proudest life every month of the year, and that we here in the Medford city government, we're here to support you in that, and to let you know that you have allies behind this rail.

887
01:05:46,729 --> 01:05:47,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

888
01:05:47,710 --> 01:05:48,470
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

889
01:05:48,490 --> 01:05:49,071
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Bears.

890
01:05:49,431 --> 01:05:50,251
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Madam President.

891
01:05:50,431 --> 01:05:56,275
[SPEAKER_24]: I think my fellow councilors have spoken well, and the resolution speaks well, but

892
01:05:57,179 --> 01:06:26,167
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, I was driving home from work the other day last week and you listen to a story and you listen to these parents and this kid in Texas, and I know it's not here, I know it's far away, but it's here, being forced to move, leave their home, leave their friends, leave their jobs, because their state says, we're not gonna let you get the medical treatment that your doctor

893
01:06:27,054 --> 01:06:37,387
[SPEAKER_24]: and your family and you want to make sure that you are healthy and safe and living comfortably in your own body.

894
01:06:38,148 --> 01:06:38,268
[SPEAKER_24]: And

895
01:06:40,649 --> 01:06:41,569
[SPEAKER_22]: It's just awful.

896
01:06:42,810 --> 01:06:49,372
[SPEAKER_22]: And so anything that we can do to say that that's not what we're going to do here, I think is very important.

897
01:06:50,612 --> 01:07:01,335
[SPEAKER_22]: I was a lot worse when I was listening to the story, so I apologize for getting emotional, but I just think that's what this is really about, saying that here we're going to let people do what they need to do to be comfortable with who they are.

898
01:07:01,735 --> 01:07:02,596
[SPEAKER_22]: That's very important.

899
01:07:02,876 --> 01:07:03,216
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

900
01:07:03,636 --> 01:07:04,436
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, President Bears.

901
01:07:05,217 --> 01:07:06,457
[SPEAKER_08]: Any further discussion from the council?

902
01:07:08,469 --> 01:07:09,170
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Wright.

903
01:07:09,330 --> 01:07:11,451
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to thank my fellow councilors for bringing this forward.

904
01:07:11,591 --> 01:07:33,459
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's really an important thing to affirm, which a way which I know this council feels and stands, and it's just very important to do right now for the reasons my fellow councilors called out in a time when people are trying to shout down, dismiss, and take back, and really, you know, take us back in time and harm a community that has fought for so long just for people to recognize their humanity.

905
01:07:34,219 --> 01:07:41,567
[SPEAKER_08]: and celebrating the hard wins in that fight, and knowing that it's something that we have to fight for every single day, and people will always fight to try to take away those hard-fought wins.

906
01:07:41,807 --> 01:07:43,629
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think it's very important we affirm this.

907
01:07:44,410 --> 01:07:45,611
[SPEAKER_08]: I thank you all for bringing this forward.

908
01:07:46,652 --> 01:07:51,357

933
01:10:27,470 --> 01:10:31,110
[SPEAKER_45]: Because I know there's been some confusion in the past.

934
01:10:31,190 --> 01:10:34,171

935
01:10:34,873 --> 01:10:38,934
[SPEAKER_45]: special permits and a site plan approval that need to be voted on by your board tonight.

936
01:10:38,954 --> 01:10:49,758

937
01:10:50,698 --> 01:10:59,081
[SPEAKER_45]: And the drive through use also classifies it as a major project, which triggers site plan review from the Community Development Board.

938
01:10:59,662 --> 01:11:06,826
[SPEAKER_45]: And because the city council is a special permit granting authority, that means that you're also the site plan review authority.

939
01:11:07,386 --> 01:11:11,828
[SPEAKER_45]: And in addition to that special permit, there was a special permit for extended hours.

940
01:11:12,709 --> 01:11:19,412
[SPEAKER_45]: And within the site plan review, there's the provision to waive the off street loading requirements.

941
01:11:20,053 --> 01:11:27,897
[SPEAKER_45]: So this was circulated amongst the different department heads who weigh in on site plan review.

942
01:11:28,957 --> 01:11:32,200
[SPEAKER_45]: They provided their comments to Community Development Board.

943
01:11:32,821 --> 01:11:34,482
[SPEAKER_45]: They held their meetings.

944
01:11:35,843 --> 01:11:50,797
[SPEAKER_45]: There was a lot of meetings with staff leading up to those meetings with the City Board, and they recommended approval with some conditions which are outlined in the memo that hopefully you will receive today.

[SPEAKER_45]: It's one loading space.

952
01:12:26,809 --> 01:12:30,171
[SPEAKER_45]: However, it's not quite needed.

953
01:12:30,191 --> 01:12:41,558
[SPEAKER_45]: And there's loading in the plaza as a whole, but that's the way that they operate their business.

954
01:12:41,598 --> 01:12:45,200
[SPEAKER_45]: They don't need the huge loading dock.

955
01:12:45,420 --> 01:12:52,905
[SPEAKER_45]: So they requested a waiver from that and the city board recommended providing that waiver.

956
01:12:55,967 --> 01:12:56,928
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

957
01:12:57,468 --> 01:12:58,028
[SPEAKER_08]: That's your question.

958
01:12:58,128 --> 01:12:58,588
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great.

959
01:12:58,648 --> 01:12:59,429
[SPEAKER_15]: I have one.

960
01:12:59,469 --> 01:13:00,089
[SPEAKER_15]: Just one question.

961
01:13:00,249 --> 01:13:01,090
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry.

962
01:13:01,590 --> 01:13:03,391
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, Daniel, thank you for being a tight.

963
01:13:03,771 --> 01:13:07,413
[SPEAKER_16]: How was the participation with the, uh, in these meetings?

964
01:13:07,433 --> 01:13:08,974
[SPEAKER_16]: Do we have a lot of community input?

965
01:13:09,774 --> 01:13:13,996
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, is that something that's that was that that was different?

966
01:13:14,256 --> 01:13:17,698
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, it was not as normal as usual.

967
01:13:19,319 --> 01:13:21,940
[SPEAKER_45]: Um, maybe at least you can weigh in.

968
01:13:21,980 --> 01:13:24,942
[SPEAKER_45]: I don't remember there being a lot of, um,

969
01:13:26,069 --> 01:13:31,092
[SPEAKER_45]: folks who had expressed interest in this or were attending just for this matter.

970
01:13:31,112 --> 01:13:41,478
[SPEAKER_45]: I don't know, perhaps Attorney Desmond might recall, but I don't remember anything that.

971
01:13:43,019 --> 01:13:45,140
[SPEAKER_16]: So not a big turnout of negatives.

972
01:13:45,721 --> 01:13:48,602
[SPEAKER_45]: Yeah, I think people were more like excited about it, if anything.

973
01:13:50,694 --> 01:13:56,257
[SPEAKER_45]: But I don't recall any opposition, but this is the public hearing here.

974
01:13:56,677 --> 01:14:02,420
[SPEAKER_45]: So there's the big signs over in the plaza.

975
01:14:03,781 --> 01:14:07,003
[SPEAKER_45]: So if anyone was even curious, they would see those big signs there.

976
01:14:07,863 --> 01:14:08,844
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

977
01:14:09,124 --> 01:14:10,925
[SPEAKER_32]: Was the mailing done, Madam President?

978
01:14:10,945 --> 01:14:13,026
[SPEAKER_45]: Was the mailing done, Danielle?

979
01:14:13,807 --> 01:14:17,249
[SPEAKER_45]: Yep, to the abutters and to all the,

980
01:14:19,597 --> 01:14:24,839
[SPEAKER_45]: various abutting communities and state departments required under the meeting law in 48.

981
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:28,741
[SPEAKER_45]: And also ran the paper for two successive weeks.

982
01:14:29,541 --> 01:14:30,862
[SPEAKER_29]: How far out did those notices go?

983
01:14:30,922 --> 01:14:37,805
[SPEAKER_29]: I know Mayor Longo, when she was a council, wanted to expand it to like 11 miles from where they were doing the project.

984
01:14:37,825 --> 01:14:39,766
[SPEAKER_08]: How far did those abutter notices go out?

985
01:14:40,886 --> 01:14:46,329
[SPEAKER_45]: There were abutters and abutters to abutters within, I think it's,

986
01:14:47,498 --> 01:14:51,200
[SPEAKER_45]: It's so many feet we get the it's the assessors certify.

987
01:14:51,921 --> 01:15:02,227
[SPEAKER_32]: It was 300 feet by law and then Mayor Lungo when she was a councilor wanted to expand that I think to 1000 or 600 or something like that and then it got passed.

988
01:15:03,248 --> 01:15:04,449
[SPEAKER_32]: But then I don't think it's been a practice.

989
01:15:04,469 --> 01:15:05,069
[SPEAKER_45]: It might be true.

990
01:15:05,769 --> 01:15:06,670
[SPEAKER_32]: Administration change.

991
01:15:08,451 --> 01:15:09,712
[SPEAKER_45]: I'm not I'm not certain.

992
01:15:09,952 --> 01:15:14,595
[SPEAKER_45]: I didn't I didn't do the administrative part in this

993
01:15:15,103 --> 01:15:17,246
[SPEAKER_45]: mailing would have gone through the city clerk's office.

994
01:15:17,866 --> 01:15:24,094
[SPEAKER_45]: So city clerk her to these might be better able to answer that question.

995
01:15:24,114 --> 01:15:30,301
[SPEAKER_08]: I can search the corporate history for 400.

996
01:15:33,383 --> 01:15:35,805
[SPEAKER_29]: And then I just have one more question, Madam President.

997
01:15:36,186 --> 01:15:40,309
[SPEAKER_32]: The process that Ms.

998
01:15:40,349 --> 01:15:53,440
[SPEAKER_32]: Evans has outlined this evening, has that been reviewed by legal and been approved by legal as the proper way to enact such a measure that's before the body this evening?

999
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:55,221
[SPEAKER_45]: I'm not sure I understand the question.

1000
01:15:56,533 --> 01:16:02,075
[SPEAKER_45]: You're asking if this is the process for the vote.

1001
01:16:02,415 --> 01:16:10,257
[SPEAKER_32]: What I'm hearing is, you know, based upon a new zoning, the city council is not required to do this, this, this and this and now we have a special permit granting authority pursuant to this and so forth.

1002
01:16:11,297 --> 01:16:15,659
[SPEAKER_32]: This is the first time we've seen one of these papers before us where we're the site plan review granting authority.

1003
01:16:16,919 --> 01:16:24,141
[SPEAKER_32]: So my question was whether or not this procedural aspect was reviewed by legal counsel to ensure that we're in compliance with our own ordinance that we draft

1004
01:16:27,670 --> 01:16:29,952
[SPEAKER_45]: I'll defer to director hunt.

1005
01:16:31,494 --> 01:16:37,760
[SPEAKER_43]: Madam President, this is the process that's outlined in the zoning recodification as approved by the city council.

1006
01:16:39,162 --> 01:16:39,502
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you.

1007
01:16:40,463 --> 01:16:40,724
[SPEAKER_32]: Right.

1008
01:16:41,044 --> 01:16:42,125
[SPEAKER_32]: So the council approved it.

1009
01:16:42,205 --> 01:16:49,453
[SPEAKER_32]: Now, we have a process that's in place as this process been reviewed by legal to ensure that it complies with what we put together.

1010
01:16:51,058 --> 01:16:55,183
[SPEAKER_43]: You know, sorry, we, we don't understand what you're asking.

1011
01:16:55,223 --> 01:17:11,580
[SPEAKER_43]: Are you asking if a lawyer sits in on every meeting of this of the process on your own or if you actually went to legal counsel, we're reading the zoning that you wrote that this body wrote, and following the steps in it.

1012
01:17:13,001 --> 01:17:22,644
[SPEAKER_43]: Sorry, we were just trying to provide some background because the council has not had a site plan review like this with so many different things come through in many years.

1013
01:17:23,624 --> 01:17:23,924
[SPEAKER_32]: Right.

1014
01:17:24,024 --> 01:17:35,627
[SPEAKER_32]: And what I'm doing is asking whether or not because the council hasn't seen one of these and so many things have come through in so many years that this process that's being established now for the first time in so many years is legally sound.

1015
01:17:37,128 --> 01:17:41,369
[SPEAKER_43]: It's, it's the processes was written by attorney Bobrowski in the zoning.

1016
01:17:42,293 --> 01:17:46,255
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay and we've conferred with him and he says this is the way we do it.

1017
01:17:48,315 --> 01:17:50,136
[SPEAKER_43]: This is what is written.

1018
01:17:50,156 --> 01:17:54,858
[SPEAKER_29]: So no we haven't conferred with legal as to whether or not this is the way that we do it.

1019
01:17:57,857 --> 01:18:07,339
[SPEAKER_32]: and said this is the process that we're going to do I have we not I don't know why every question we ask, it's a yes or no question gets 6,000 different answers.

1020
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:19,162
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess was there any additional legal understanding that attorney Bobrowski helped us in writing this was there any additional legal consultation in this process, as far as understanding that these are the steps that need to be taken.

1021
01:18:19,804 --> 01:18:33,908
[SPEAKER_43]: So each applicant has a lawyer and we periodically review work with outside counsel, if we have questions about the various processes in front of us, but this is a very standard site plan review special permits.

1022
01:18:34,288 --> 01:18:37,849
[SPEAKER_43]: This is something that every community that's under 48 follows.

1023
01:18:39,509 --> 01:18:43,312
[SPEAKER_43]: Um, so there's nothing unusual about this process whatsoever.

1024
01:18:43,332 --> 01:18:48,297
[SPEAKER_43]: This is just not something that this, this council has seen in a couple of years.

1025
01:18:48,757 --> 01:19:00,908
[SPEAKER_43]: So we wanted to provide some background, especially given that there are a number of department heads have given done review of this project, and that you have conditions in front of you that the applicant has agreed to.

1026
01:19:01,448 --> 01:19:04,691
[SPEAKER_43]: And so we wanted to ensure that the council was aware of that.

1027
01:19:05,296 --> 01:19:12,858
[SPEAKER_43]: and would incorporate the conditions that the applicants already agreed to that were the requests of the department heads.

1028
01:19:14,679 --> 01:19:19,320
[SPEAKER_08]: So is that enough?

1029
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:19,460
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1030
01:19:19,660 --> 01:19:20,920
[SPEAKER_08]: Director, just so I can understand.

1031
01:19:21,861 --> 01:19:25,682
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is, what's before us isn't the result.

1032
01:19:26,062 --> 01:19:27,622
[SPEAKER_08]: This is not triggered by our new zoning.

1033
01:19:27,642 --> 01:19:28,802
[SPEAKER_08]: This is something that was already there.

1034
01:19:28,882 --> 01:19:32,904
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just a series of papers together that has not been presented like this in a number of years, correct?

1035
01:19:33,584 --> 01:19:34,264
[SPEAKER_08]: That is correct.

1036
01:19:35,354 --> 01:19:42,138
[SPEAKER_43]: Most of this is governed by chapter 40 a although there is this special permits, whether their special permits or site plan review.

1037
01:19:42,658 --> 01:19:50,463
[SPEAKER_43]: That's part of our zoning, we did not change when a special when the site plan review is needed to the zoning.

1038
01:19:50,483 --> 01:19:56,306
[SPEAKER_43]: And this, we did not change if I remember correctly, who's the special permit granting authority in something like this.

1039
01:19:59,753 --> 01:20:00,674
[SPEAKER_43]: We have the petitioner.

1040
01:20:01,354 --> 01:20:04,276
[SPEAKER_43]: Sorry, we don't want to present their case for them.

1041
01:20:04,336 --> 01:20:17,443
[SPEAKER_43]: We just wanted you to know what process they've been in front of, what boards have reviewed it, what department heads have reviewed it, and that there are a number of things that they've already agreed to and that you have those in writing.

1042
01:20:18,364 --> 01:20:18,644
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1043
01:20:18,664 --> 01:20:19,144
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate it.

1044
01:20:19,755 --> 01:20:24,039
[SPEAKER_38]: Good evening, President morale and city Councilors Kathleen Desmond for the applicant.

1045
01:20:24,620 --> 01:20:28,343
[SPEAKER_38]: Before we get into the nuts and bolts to address that issue.

1046
01:20:28,763 --> 01:20:38,753
[SPEAKER_38]: We did provide under the ordinance to signage because there are our frontage was over 200 feet place those on Riverside Ave and one within the parking area.

1047
01:20:39,193 --> 01:20:54,901
[SPEAKER_38]: In addition to that, in terms of providing notice we obtained from the assessor's office and a butters list of all the butters within 400 square feet, which is what is required under the major site plan requirements 400 square feet, and that was provided.

1048
01:20:56,943 --> 01:21:02,467
[SPEAKER_38]: Tonight with me I have a representative of raising Keynes restaurant, LLC Michelle brutal.

1049
01:21:03,307 --> 01:21:09,331
[SPEAKER_38]: Karen Johnson of charter realty development is also here on behalf of those way Plaza limited partnership.

1050
01:21:09,872 --> 01:21:17,997
[SPEAKER_38]: In addition to that we have the project team project engineer Eric rule of all the engineering project traffic engineer Patrick Dunford.

1051
01:21:18,450 --> 01:21:26,837
[SPEAKER_38]: of VHB and our project architect, Jeffrey Portnay, who drew the short straw and has to do the Zoom presentation this evening.

1052
01:21:27,237 --> 01:21:28,238
[SPEAKER_38]: He's with us remote.

1053
01:21:29,219 --> 01:21:39,827
[SPEAKER_38]: Before we get into the nuts and bolts of the site plan, I wanted to let Melissa say a few words to the council as to what Raising Canes is and where they initiated and how they operate their business.

1054
01:21:39,847 --> 01:21:40,628
[SPEAKER_38]: So I'll let her start.

1055
01:21:41,429 --> 01:21:41,749
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

1056
01:21:45,956 --> 01:21:46,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, good evening.

1057
01:21:46,796 --> 01:21:51,598
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Melissa Brochel and I'm the property development manager for the Northeast region of raising Keynes.

1058
01:21:52,218 --> 01:21:57,960
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank you very much for giving us an opportunity to talk this evening and thank you for your time in advance.

1059
01:21:58,720 --> 01:22:02,541
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to just talk a little bit about what raising Keynes is and how we came to be.

1060
01:22:03,161 --> 01:22:07,723
[SPEAKER_03]: It all started out in the early 1990s as I'm sure most of us remember very fondly.

1061
01:22:07,743 --> 01:22:14,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Our founder and CEO Todd Graves, he started the company with a great idea thinking that

1062
01:22:15,425 --> 01:22:18,647
[SPEAKER_03]: He could open a restaurant with just serving chicken fingers.

1063
01:22:19,627 --> 01:22:26,912
[SPEAKER_03]: His college professor however did not think that that was very successful so that only lit a fire in him to try and figure it out and make it work.

1064
01:22:27,752 --> 01:22:32,595
[SPEAKER_03]: He moved to Los Angeles in 1994 and started working as a Boilermaker.

1065
01:22:33,635 --> 01:22:43,561
[SPEAKER_03]: And then in 1995 he moved up to Alaska and started fishing for sockeye salmon so that he could raise enough money to start his dream.

1066
01:22:43,581 --> 01:22:48,464
[SPEAKER_03]: And that dream is our one love which is our delicious chicken finger meals.

1067
01:22:49,185 --> 01:22:53,888
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we serve every time you go to a Raising King's restaurant, that's what you will come into.

1068
01:22:54,768 --> 01:23:06,096
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the big things that Raising Canes is very proud of is their community involvement, which is really what I would like to hone in on just as an introduction.

1069
01:23:06,617 --> 01:23:13,061
[SPEAKER_03]: We have six areas of focus that is very important, very near and dear to our hearts as well as to our founder.

1070
01:23:13,962 --> 01:23:16,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Education is the first topic.

1071
01:23:16,824 --> 01:23:21,468
[SPEAKER_03]: We care about students and giving them the tools that they need to succeed in their community.

1072
01:23:22,048 --> 01:23:30,237
[SPEAKER_03]: We also, the second one is feeding the hungry, which gentlemen had that was up here with the Mustang football shirt on had talked about earlier.

1073
01:23:30,257 --> 01:23:35,822
[SPEAKER_03]: That's also something that's very near and dear to our hearts so we will do anything that we can to help local food pantries.

1074
01:23:36,643 --> 01:23:39,867
[SPEAKER_03]: And we also do help support a lot of the community involvement with

1075
01:23:41,428 --> 01:23:45,309
[SPEAKER_03]: the Mustang football team or the Medford youth soccer that was mentioned earlier.

1076
01:23:46,170 --> 01:23:48,131
[SPEAKER_03]: We like to give back as much as we can.

1077
01:23:49,091 --> 01:24:01,097
[SPEAKER_03]: So, along with that helps with the active lifestyle that goes along with supporting walking trails or runs or being able to help fundraise for other other members of the community.

1078
01:24:02,317 --> 01:24:12,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Another area of focus that we currently have is our pet welfare, which as you can tell by most of the signage on our building that raising keen is our dog.

1079
01:24:12,982 --> 01:24:14,082
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the founders dog.

1080
01:24:14,482 --> 01:24:20,085
[SPEAKER_03]: We read he named the restaurant after him so pet welfare is very extremely important to us.

1081
01:24:21,265 --> 01:24:23,548
[SPEAKER_03]: going along with that is the entrepreneurship.

1082
01:24:24,609 --> 01:24:34,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Clearly, Todd had a great idea when he tried to open up his restaurants, and we like to support small businesses the best that we can in the communities that we're able to come into.

1083
01:24:36,442 --> 01:24:39,883
[SPEAKER_03]: the sixth area of focus is really anything else that I didn't cover.

1084
01:24:40,743 --> 01:24:47,645
[SPEAKER_03]: We really do like to just try and give the community as much of an opportunity to be involved with us as we are with them.

1085
01:24:47,665 --> 01:24:54,007
[SPEAKER_03]: And with that being said, I would like to turn it over to Kathy and we'll go through our presentation a little bit further.

1086
01:24:54,087 --> 01:24:54,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1087
01:24:54,947 --> 01:24:55,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1088
01:24:58,709 --> 01:25:15,733
[SPEAKER_38]: So as previously stated, this is an application for special permit to construct the 3,326 square foot eat in restaurant with a drive through to be situated within the confines of the outdoor shopping center, known as the spells way Plaza located at 760 Fells way, Medford.

1089
01:25:16,311 --> 01:25:33,144
[SPEAKER_38]: The proposed site for raising canes restaurant is located within the C one district that requires a special permit for the establishment of a need and drive through restaurant, the drive through portion of the restaurant specifically pursuant to table of uses a and parking regulations item g two of the ordinance.

1090
01:25:34,025 --> 01:25:45,152
[SPEAKER_38]: In addition to the special permit for the drive-through, we are also seeking a waiver of the loading requirement by special permit under 6.1.10 of the new ordinance.

1091
01:25:46,173 --> 01:25:49,075
[SPEAKER_38]: That is because we were cited for the violation.

1092
01:25:49,715 --> 01:26:00,402
[SPEAKER_38]: There is some issue whether or not 6.1.3, which indicates that loading areas are not required, or indicates that the minimum requirements, not the loading areas, but the minimum parking requirements,

1093
01:26:00,842 --> 01:26:05,764
[SPEAKER_38]: don't apply to buildings under 5000 square feet which is what this is.

1094
01:26:06,584 --> 01:26:23,471
[SPEAKER_38]: In addition to that there is also another provision 6.1 point seven, which allows for consumer retail set a group together on the same property to share essentially the loading spaces, and we would qualify for that as well based on the fact that there's four loading spaces

1095
01:26:24,011 --> 01:26:48,526
[SPEAKER_38]: on the property, but they're located on the southerly end of the property behind the stop and shop, and the other restaurants so we decided to move forward and ask the council, rather to give us a special permit to waive the loading requirement and not have a dedicated space, because it wasn't realistic or practical to assume that that the loading the vehicles would park behind the stop and shop.

1096
01:26:50,367 --> 01:27:12,063
[SPEAKER_38]: building and then and then truck product over so what we have done and what we have asked for in connection with the loading space waiver is also an extended hours of one hour after operation for purposes of being able to have deliveries in front of the building at a time when the parking lot is essentially

1097
01:27:12,563 --> 01:27:18,465
[SPEAKER_38]: empty, and we'll go through that with the site plan but that is the basis of the relief that we're seeking.

1098
01:27:19,265 --> 01:27:22,046
[SPEAKER_38]: With respect to the special permit for extended hours.

1099
01:27:22,767 --> 01:27:29,429
[SPEAKER_38]: That is again Sunday through Thursday, the operation hours will be nine to 11 which are permitted under the ordinance.

1100
01:27:29,929 --> 01:27:31,610
[SPEAKER_38]: We're asking for an additional hour from 11 to 12.

1101
01:27:32,930 --> 01:27:34,271
[SPEAKER_38]: only for delivery purposes.

1102
01:27:34,992 --> 01:27:44,501
[SPEAKER_38]: Friday and Saturday, we're asking for one more hour of operation to 12am with an hour again for delivery from 12 to 11 from 12 to one.

1103
01:27:45,342 --> 01:27:52,789
[SPEAKER_38]: And I think it's significant to stay to that those deliveries aren't every evening, that probably two to three times a week that those deliveries

1104
01:27:53,289 --> 01:27:53,790
[SPEAKER_38]: would occur.

1105
01:27:54,891 --> 01:28:03,139
[SPEAKER_38]: But having them after hours, the the parking lot is not full and it's less disruptive to the surrounding area.

1106
01:28:03,740 --> 01:28:11,467
[SPEAKER_38]: So with that, in terms of what we're looking for relief, I'm going to turn it over to Eric to rule and he'll take you through the site plan and how it all works.

1107
01:28:12,088 --> 01:28:12,348
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

1108
01:28:14,326 --> 01:28:16,927
[SPEAKER_32]: Point of information, Madam President, before he starts, I just want to go back to that.

1109
01:28:17,388 --> 01:28:30,934
[SPEAKER_32]: So Attorney Desmond, the proposal is that all your deliveries are going to take place between 12 o'clock and 9 1 o'clock in the morning in a in a location that abuts a residential neighborhood between 11 to 12 for Sunday through Thursday and not every evening.

1110
01:28:31,515 --> 01:28:37,077
[SPEAKER_38]: And I believe that the Panera as well accepts deliveries after hours in the same span of time.

1111
01:28:37,097 --> 01:28:38,498
[SPEAKER_29]: It's not working out so great, though.

1112
01:28:40,385 --> 01:28:43,766
[SPEAKER_38]: Okay, I don't, we didn't have any issue.

1113
01:28:43,786 --> 01:28:50,629
[SPEAKER_38]: No one raised any in community meetings of that kind and I think it's significant to indicate that we also did have a community meeting.

1114
01:28:51,329 --> 01:28:57,652
[SPEAKER_38]: In addition to, in addition to the community development back in December, in December.

1115
01:28:58,669 --> 01:29:00,492
[SPEAKER_38]: in December because we started the process.

1116
01:29:01,113 --> 01:29:10,808
[SPEAKER_38]: We had the meeting in December, the application was filed in January, we went through the CD board application process we came out of that may, and we're here before you tonight on June 20.

1117
01:29:13,613 --> 01:29:26,818
[SPEAKER_32]: And when you went before the CD board this proposal of eliminating the loading dock and then telling them that you're going to apply for a special permit before us to have the loading take place after hours was presented to them in that fashion.

1118
01:29:27,318 --> 01:29:28,939
[SPEAKER_29]: It was, and that was something that they supported.

1119
01:29:30,219 --> 01:29:32,720
[SPEAKER_38]: It was, it was, it received a favorable recommendation.

1120
01:29:41,345 --> 01:30:01,353
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening for the record Eric the rule or engineering site civil, just take a moment to orient everyone to the site I'm sure we're familiar with it but it's a 31,000 square foot leased parcel within the fells way shopping plaza will be utilizing an underutilized parking area as part of the development you can see it's there in the star.

1121
01:30:02,613 --> 01:30:09,280
[SPEAKER_01]: The lease area is essentially bounded by Felsway and Riverside to the north.

1122
01:30:10,100 --> 01:30:16,847
[SPEAKER_01]: To the west, you have Eastern Bank, and then to the south is an existing shopping plaza drive aisle.

1123
01:30:18,629 --> 01:30:20,250
[SPEAKER_01]: Under proposed conditions,

1124
01:30:22,737 --> 01:30:30,284
[SPEAKER_01]: effectively about a 3300 square foot restaurant with a drive through their 48 interior seats.

1125
01:30:30,884 --> 01:30:36,229
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also proposing 18 exterior patio seats for seasonal seating.

1126
01:30:37,430 --> 01:30:48,539
[SPEAKER_01]: We are providing 16 parking spaces within the least area, which is compliant with the 10 required by zoning, but there are options for overflow parking and some of the underutilized parking spaces outside of the lease area.

1127
01:30:49,941 --> 01:30:57,496
[SPEAKER_01]: Pat will be up here in a moment to speak more about the drive-thru and the functionality and the operations of the drive-thru and the site circulation, so I won't speak to that at this moment.

1128
01:30:59,554 --> 01:31:04,377
[SPEAKER_01]: relative to all the technical details of the site plan, stormwater, utilities, lighting.

1129
01:31:04,397 --> 01:31:17,866
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, that was fully designed, engineered, and submitted as part of this package, but it was reviewed through multiple meetings with city staff, different departments, and through the Community Development Board site plan process that we went through.

1130
01:31:17,886 --> 01:31:25,391
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're comfortable that we're meeting all state and local regulations as it applies to any of the site design standards.

1131
01:31:28,670 --> 01:31:38,279
[SPEAKER_28]: Does the applicant intend to apply for a license for an illuminated light or permit for an illuminated light sign?

1132
01:31:38,399 --> 01:31:51,031
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I believe the signage is we would follow up with that but I don't know at this point.

1133
01:31:51,764 --> 01:31:56,531
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm assuming you'd want the light to light up if you guys want to be open to one o'clock in the morning on the weekends, you don't want people driving by it.

1134
01:31:56,871 --> 01:32:02,038
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, but there's also houses across the street, people that live there.

1135
01:32:03,420 --> 01:32:03,881
[SPEAKER_01]: Understood.

1136
01:32:08,126 --> 01:32:08,467
[SPEAKER_08]: Continue.

1137
01:32:09,797 --> 01:32:12,838
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on the next slide, Jeff, you wouldn't mind going to the landscape side.

1138
01:32:13,178 --> 01:32:18,560
[SPEAKER_01]: Effectively, we're providing over 400 new plantings on this site.

1139
01:32:18,620 --> 01:32:25,403
[SPEAKER_01]: Raising canes is very adamant, just gives us the ability to provide a very dense landscaping plan.

1140
01:32:25,443 --> 01:32:31,185
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very proud of their landscaping plan and do a great job maintaining it.

1141
01:32:32,306 --> 01:32:38,048
[SPEAKER_01]: So over 400 new plantings, we've continued the street trees down Riverside.

1142
01:32:38,948 --> 01:32:43,591
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're giving back about 390 new square feet of additional green space as part of this development.

1143
01:32:44,011 --> 01:32:54,218
[SPEAKER_01]: And seasonally, if you go to the next slide, Jeff, we'll see, you know, through the different seasons, we don't always have color coming through on the landscape plan.

1144
01:32:54,238 --> 01:33:01,043
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's easy to do that in the spring and the fall, of course, but in the winter, I'll make sure we have some color coming through.

1145
01:33:01,063 --> 01:33:04,205
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is just some of that illustration of what you could expect there.

1146
01:33:06,566 --> 01:33:16,129
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, I can go through any of the technical details with any questions you might have on that, but I'll keep it at high level right now and I'll turn it over to Pat to talk a little bit more about traffic and site circulation.

1147
01:33:16,729 --> 01:33:24,132
[SPEAKER_32]: Are there any new curb cuts that will be made from either Riverside Ave or the Fellsway to gain access to the property as part of the site plan?

1148
01:33:24,832 --> 01:33:24,992
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

1149
01:33:25,552 --> 01:33:25,832
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

1150
01:33:27,513 --> 01:33:28,893
[SPEAKER_08]: There are questions from Councilors at this time.

1151
01:33:32,503 --> 01:33:36,005
[SPEAKER_08]: think, yeah, we'll go into the next and we may have questions for everyone after all.

1152
01:33:36,305 --> 01:33:37,046
[SPEAKER_08]: We're all through.

1153
01:33:37,226 --> 01:33:37,766
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll keep moving.

1154
01:33:39,587 --> 01:33:40,188
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, good evening.

1155
01:33:40,648 --> 01:33:41,849
[SPEAKER_21]: My name is Patrick Dunford.

1156
01:33:41,869 --> 01:33:44,090
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm a transportation engineer with VHB.

1157
01:33:44,711 --> 01:33:47,773
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to give you just a brief overview tonight of the

1158
01:33:49,155 --> 01:34:03,439
[SPEAKER_21]: traffic impact and access study that we did kind of a high level was a very extensive study but there's something we had reviewed extensively with the city traffic and mobility staff and came up with certain mitigation items which I'll show you tonight.

1159
01:34:04,259 --> 01:34:11,061
[SPEAKER_21]: Before we get to that I guess to follow up on one kind of bookkeeping component to this that being the delivery and the loading.

1160
01:34:12,001 --> 01:34:19,085
[SPEAKER_21]: The graphic that's up right now and also appears in your pamphlet is depicting how these deliveries actually would occur.

1161
01:34:20,927 --> 01:34:24,709
[SPEAKER_21]: The trucks themselves would originate from the south on the Felsway.

1162
01:34:25,438 --> 01:34:28,740
[SPEAKER_21]: coming up the turn onto Riverside and then into the plaza.

1163
01:34:28,760 --> 01:34:42,890
[SPEAKER_21]: And what you're seeing in this graphic is a standard engineering drawing showing the actual turns of the truck, demonstrating that the truck can make these maneuvers without having to travel across parking spaces or create any undue hazard.

1164
01:34:44,351 --> 01:34:51,757
[SPEAKER_21]: We had talked about the absence of a dedicated loading space, but we do in fact have loading to accommodate the use of the site.

1165
01:34:52,378 --> 01:35:00,284
[SPEAKER_21]: And what we're showing here is the truck stopping alongside of the building within a roughly 12 foot by 50 foot area to do the unloading.

1166
01:35:01,145 --> 01:35:05,329
[SPEAKER_21]: As a side note to that one benefit to not having a traditional loading dock.

1167
01:35:05,869 --> 01:35:10,812
[SPEAKER_21]: is that the truck is moving in a continuous path through the site, so it's not backing up.

1168
01:35:10,972 --> 01:35:16,856
[SPEAKER_21]: So at least to that extent, you avoid that beeping, which can be annoying to hear at certain times a day, obviously.

1169
01:35:17,417 --> 01:35:23,420
[SPEAKER_21]: Again, it's not a daily occurrence, probably one to three times per week at the end of the business day.

1170
01:35:24,001 --> 01:35:26,502
[SPEAKER_21]: So this is something we had reviewed with city staff.

1171
01:35:26,582 --> 01:35:31,766
[SPEAKER_21]: They were comfortable with the configuration and the expected operation of the loading.

1172
01:35:32,766 --> 01:35:35,829
[SPEAKER_21]: And again, that was just one of several items that we had discussed.

1173
01:35:37,110 --> 01:35:40,152
[SPEAKER_21]: Overall, the site mission.

1174
01:35:40,192 --> 01:35:51,101
[SPEAKER_32]: So, what you're telling me is that you're going to guarantee that these trucks that are delivering are going to follow this route every single time that they come here at 12 o'clock at night, three times a week or four times a week that they do it from now until the end of time as long as we have this permit.

1175
01:35:53,250 --> 01:35:55,852
[SPEAKER_21]: The trucks themselves are not going to be arriving randomly.

1176
01:35:55,932 --> 01:36:00,014
[SPEAKER_21]: They originate from a Raising Cane's warehouse facility, Taunton, Massachusetts.

1177
01:36:00,654 --> 01:36:06,657
[SPEAKER_21]: Before the store opens, there's a protocol that will go over exactly how they're supposed to navigate through the site.

1178
01:36:07,097 --> 01:36:10,059
[SPEAKER_21]: So the drivers aren't just showing up going, how do I do this?

1179
01:36:10,739 --> 01:36:13,800
[SPEAKER_21]: This is a pretty prototypical layout for Raising Cane's.

1180
01:36:14,361 --> 01:36:16,302
[SPEAKER_21]: So if they're delivered to another site,

1181
01:36:17,285 --> 01:36:19,769
[SPEAKER_21]: and this will be, I think, the fourth in Massachusetts.

1182
01:36:20,270 --> 01:36:22,493
[SPEAKER_21]: It's basically the same type of operation.

1183
01:36:23,214 --> 01:36:25,978
[SPEAKER_21]: So they'll review it with the drivers ahead of time.

1184
01:36:26,899 --> 01:36:29,663
[SPEAKER_21]: It is within a remote part of the site.

1185
01:36:29,904 --> 01:36:33,128
[SPEAKER_21]: That is, it's not on top of any access driveways to the plaza.

1186
01:36:33,729 --> 01:36:37,672
[SPEAKER_21]: At some point in time, there's always going to be one driver who might get confused.

1187
01:36:38,252 --> 01:36:43,335
[SPEAKER_21]: But by and large, going over this should be the same as any other deliveries that occur.

1188
01:36:43,816 --> 01:36:45,197
[SPEAKER_21]: And again, it's within the site.

1189
01:36:45,597 --> 01:36:49,359
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's not going to be backing up on a public roadways or state highway.

1190
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:51,761
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have a way of enforcing that?

1191
01:36:51,781 --> 01:36:53,162
[SPEAKER_09]: Because

1192
01:36:53,919 --> 01:37:02,786
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, in Medford we had a 18 wheeler I think that was supposed to be taking a certain route and they didn't and they slammed into an overpass and destroyed it.

1193
01:37:02,827 --> 01:37:05,829
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think we've, we've been a little bit burned on that in the past.

1194
01:37:05,889 --> 01:37:07,871
[SPEAKER_08]: So just want to raise that as an example.

1195
01:37:08,402 --> 01:37:11,786
[SPEAKER_21]: With any traffic, obviously there's a variable of people driving.

1196
01:37:12,767 --> 01:37:16,932
[SPEAKER_21]: Massachusetts, it's extra special and I've seen certain unique things in Medford as well.

1197
01:37:17,613 --> 01:37:27,485
[SPEAKER_21]: We try to address these things through good design, which I think Bowler has presented a very good design, and going over it ahead of time with professional drivers who are going to be serving the site.

1198
01:37:28,266 --> 01:37:29,708
[SPEAKER_21]: That's pretty much the best we can do.

1199
01:37:30,409 --> 01:37:34,374
[SPEAKER_21]: At some point in infinity, maybe there's an issue where someone has to back up within the site.

1200
01:37:35,015 --> 01:37:42,825
[SPEAKER_21]: But as an engineering professional, there's nothing I see in the layout of the site that would be confusing to a driver or unorthodox to a driver.

1201
01:37:43,406 --> 01:37:46,210
[SPEAKER_21]: So to that extent, we've covered it to the extent possible.

1202
01:37:46,943 --> 01:37:49,645
[SPEAKER_29]: Because you did say they were going to be coming from Taunton, right?

1203
01:37:49,745 --> 01:37:53,088
[SPEAKER_29]: So it's guaranteed their first stop is Medford every time, right?

1204
01:37:53,108 --> 01:37:56,170
[SPEAKER_29]: Because they're coming from, I mean, those are the variables that I'm talking about.

1205
01:37:56,190 --> 01:38:00,374
[SPEAKER_32]: It's like, there's no way we can guarantee that they're going to take the same route every time and go in there the same way every time.

1206
01:38:01,257 --> 01:38:06,600
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, to access the plaza, there's a limited number of areas that you can come in.

1207
01:38:07,341 --> 01:38:09,282
[SPEAKER_21]: And again, they could come in through the south.

1208
01:38:09,542 --> 01:38:17,247
[SPEAKER_21]: And if they did that, they'd still be entering on the side closest to the building because they know they have to deliver the goods next to the building.

1209
01:38:18,007 --> 01:38:30,951
[SPEAKER_21]: We did make other certain changes within the traffic circulation in that part of the plaza, which I can show you in a moment to limit the number of options to get to the building, which should help make it simpler.

1210
01:38:31,912 --> 01:38:35,953
[SPEAKER_21]: But again, through having designed several of these it's pretty straightforward.

1211
01:38:36,893 --> 01:38:38,674
[SPEAKER_21]: People are people but this is pretty.

1212
01:38:39,923 --> 01:38:42,966
[SPEAKER_21]: pretty safe as far as the delivery options.

1213
01:38:43,606 --> 01:38:48,531
[SPEAKER_32]: And then you spoke about a couple of other Raising Canes that have very similar patterns, I guess, here.

1214
01:38:48,551 --> 01:38:52,014
[SPEAKER_32]: So is it their model that they don't have loading docks?

1215
01:38:52,414 --> 01:38:52,895
[SPEAKER_32]: Any of that sort?

1216
01:38:53,295 --> 01:38:56,778
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, for Massachusetts, I think this is now going to be the fourth one.

1217
01:38:57,139 --> 01:38:58,980
[SPEAKER_21]: Most of their facilities are out of state.

1218
01:38:59,321 --> 01:39:00,482
[SPEAKER_39]: I don't care about out of state just yet.

1219
01:39:00,882 --> 01:39:02,583
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, that's the basis for their prototype.

1220
01:39:02,883 --> 01:39:04,183
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's worked in other states.

1221
01:39:04,263 --> 01:39:06,124
[SPEAKER_21]: There's a limited number in Massachusetts.

1222
01:39:06,664 --> 01:39:11,466
[SPEAKER_21]: Two of them are in downtown Boston, one being Boston University, the other being Back Bay.

1223
01:39:11,946 --> 01:39:18,589
[SPEAKER_21]: So those really don't accurately reflect Medford in terms of the more open conditions compared to a downtown setting.

1224
01:39:19,569 --> 01:39:21,510
[SPEAKER_21]: So it is a prototypical building.

1225
01:39:22,190 --> 01:39:25,173
[SPEAKER_21]: with a fairly normal loading pattern.

1226
01:39:25,354 --> 01:39:31,781
[SPEAKER_21]: I can't speak to their other sites if they've required zoning relief for those, but I can tell you functionally where the truck would be parked.

1227
01:39:32,121 --> 01:39:35,905
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not blocking driveways and it's not creating any undue hazard.

1228
01:39:36,886 --> 01:39:38,808
[SPEAKER_21]: Of course not, it's coming at one o'clock in the morning.

1229
01:39:39,469 --> 01:39:41,050
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, midnight, but point taken.

1230
01:39:42,091 --> 01:39:48,517
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's actually by design because you want to avoid conflicts between vehicles, but more importantly, pedestrians.

1231
01:39:49,217 --> 01:39:54,542
[SPEAKER_21]: I wouldn't want to be promoting the truck out there at the busiest time of day where you have people walking to and from the building.

1232
01:39:55,182 --> 01:40:00,386
[SPEAKER_21]: So the timing of the deliveries and the nature of the deliveries, it's a pretty efficient plan.

1233
01:40:00,406 --> 01:40:02,688
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that's the best we can hope for in this case.

1234
01:40:02,888 --> 01:40:04,370
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, they're efficient plans for the business.

1235
01:40:05,540 --> 01:40:08,081
[SPEAKER_29]: But there might not be efficient plans for the residents that live in the neighborhood.

1236
01:40:08,422 --> 01:40:15,886
[SPEAKER_29]: And I think that's the number one concern right is the abundance right the people live across the street we have residents on Riverside we have residents across middle sector residents on the phone.

1237
01:40:16,646 --> 01:40:21,749
[SPEAKER_27]: And that's where I'm coming from on this but I appreciate it I'm not gonna keep saying we got residents live across the street I think you get it.

1238
01:40:23,854 --> 01:40:34,677
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, moving forward I guess on the site circulation, we have another graphic for that here this is similar to what Eric had shown earlier so I won't belabor a lot of the points.

1239
01:40:35,298 --> 01:40:38,198
[SPEAKER_21]: I guess just to start to the top since we were just discussing it.

1240
01:40:39,019 --> 01:40:46,121
[SPEAKER_21]: You can see, kind of in the background there's to do not enter in a stop sign at the very top of the colored area.

1241
01:40:46,900 --> 01:40:55,565
[SPEAKER_21]: What that is doing is today that allows for two-way traffic through that area between the bank and the parcel where Raising Cane's is going to be located.

1242
01:40:56,266 --> 01:41:00,808
[SPEAKER_21]: We felt that might create some undue conflicts with the exiting drive-through topic.

1243
01:41:01,089 --> 01:41:06,592
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sorry, exiting drive-through traffic which would be heading counterclockwise around the building.

1244
01:41:07,369 --> 01:41:15,896
[SPEAKER_21]: To avoid that, what we ended up doing was making that top aisle exiting the drive-thru one way heading from right to left.

1245
01:41:16,617 --> 01:41:21,061
[SPEAKER_21]: So you're not going to have any customers coming in that side conflicting with drive-thru traffic.

1246
01:41:21,441 --> 01:41:24,083
[SPEAKER_21]: You're certainly not going to have any loading trucks doing the same.

1247
01:41:24,924 --> 01:41:28,005
[SPEAKER_21]: that's going to be put in place through the combination of the sign shown.

1248
01:41:28,525 --> 01:41:34,888
[SPEAKER_21]: And in the background, there's striping indicating do not enter and a stop line for traffic going the other direction.

1249
01:41:35,368 --> 01:41:40,230
[SPEAKER_21]: And again, this is something that was presented both to engineering and the traffic and mobility group.

1250
01:41:41,010 --> 01:41:43,871
[SPEAKER_21]: They were comfortable with that and agreed it was a beneficial change.

1251
01:41:44,491 --> 01:41:51,674
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think other city bodies also would wade in as well, suggesting some sort of change of that nature might be beneficial.

1252
01:41:52,878 --> 01:42:02,447
[SPEAKER_21]: The layout of the site, we had talked earlier, we're not creating any new curb cuts and actually within the property, we're eliminating a few internal curb cuts.

1253
01:42:03,488 --> 01:42:16,401
[SPEAKER_21]: As you come in off of 28 heading south, turning right into the property, that portion remains unchanged with the exception, we'll be adding a new sidewalk there to make it somewhat more walkable than it is today.

1254
01:42:18,514 --> 01:42:31,399
[SPEAKER_21]: And as you then turn right heading towards raising canes for eliminating to curb cuts that exists mainly to accommodate the building in the drive through, but it does cut down the amount of cross traffic, which could create conflicts there.

1255
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:39,583
[SPEAKER_21]: The building itself, Erica described described earlier, and Jeff our architect is going to talk about some of the other elements shortly.

1256
01:42:39,603 --> 01:42:41,504
[SPEAKER_21]: The drive through.

1257
01:42:42,558 --> 01:42:51,371
[SPEAKER_21]: A typical drive-through for any sort of food establishment has a single lane starting, you order the food, you end up at the window.

1258
01:42:51,391 --> 01:42:57,821
[SPEAKER_21]: A lot of the chains have introduced two lanes where you come up and then merge down to one at the window.

1259
01:42:58,772 --> 01:43:17,319
[SPEAKER_21]: What raising canes, and I think I've seen a few others doing it as well, is now, besides just doing that during the quieter times, during the busiest times of the day, lunchtime, dinner, they introduce a full two-lane operation from the point where you enter the drive-through to the point where you pick up the food.

1260
01:43:18,199 --> 01:43:25,962
[SPEAKER_21]: That is managed with staff wearing reflective vests who would have undergone safety program internally.

1261
01:43:26,582 --> 01:43:49,295
[SPEAKER_21]: where they will take the order and they will deliver the order to the cars in the line which helps reduce the vehicle queuing significantly along with the fact that it's a very I guess focused menu by raising canes where it's strictly chicken finger based and not a wide variety that might lead to longer prep times which in turn can have longer delays.

1262
01:43:50,390 --> 01:44:06,437
[SPEAKER_21]: By having this sort of operation contained within that parcel, we looked at records and traffic studies of existing sites across the country and found that this would be more than adequate to accommodate the vehicle queues that you might see here.

1263
01:44:07,038 --> 01:44:11,460
[SPEAKER_21]: We looked at a worst case basis, too, just to make sure we weren't cherry picking good sites.

1264
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:13,701
[SPEAKER_21]: It was really making sure we could fit it.

1265
01:44:15,040 --> 01:44:22,664
[SPEAKER_21]: Unlike a lot of restaurant facilities, this is not having direct access onto a major busy roadway.

1266
01:44:23,024 --> 01:44:28,027
[SPEAKER_21]: You have to enter the plaza and then turn into a circulation aisle leading to Raisin Canes.

1267
01:44:28,847 --> 01:44:37,192
[SPEAKER_21]: Because of that, it provides an extra measure of protection from any traffic backing up on neighboring streets, creating any kind of issues.

1268
01:44:38,633 --> 01:44:41,614
[SPEAKER_21]: Likewise, Eric had talked earlier about the parking supply.

1269
01:44:41,754 --> 01:44:44,456
[SPEAKER_21]: We do have, in the immediate pad area,

1270
01:44:45,051 --> 01:44:48,333
[SPEAKER_21]: a parking supply that can accommodate the raising canes demand.

1271
01:44:49,634 --> 01:44:53,236
[SPEAKER_21]: If there are extra busy times, there is more just out of curiosity.

1272
01:44:53,376 --> 01:44:59,539
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, how many spots on the screen what you're seeing there's 11 in the aisle closest to the building.

1273
01:45:00,100 --> 01:45:03,021
[SPEAKER_21]: And on the left side of that median, there is another nine.

1274
01:45:04,785 --> 01:45:14,636
[SPEAKER_21]: So 20 spots to exactly in that immediate area, the plaza to the south and I guess, as an aside the overall Plaza has 573 parking spaces.

1275
01:45:15,337 --> 01:45:25,307
[SPEAKER_21]: So if someone isn't able to park conveniently right at the front door, they would be able to park in the widely underutilized parking field to the south.

1276
01:45:26,288 --> 01:45:27,968
[SPEAKER_21]: to make sure that's a safe condition.

1277
01:45:28,028 --> 01:45:36,711
[SPEAKER_21]: We are introducing a striped crosswalk, so it's very clear and focused how people are gonna cross that drive aisle to get to Raising Canes.

1278
01:45:37,371 --> 01:45:44,393
[SPEAKER_21]: But we do expect it'll be predominantly drive-through oriented with some of that parking activity also being available.

1279
01:45:45,923 --> 01:45:46,644
[SPEAKER_32]: Just one more question.

1280
01:45:47,785 --> 01:45:50,448
[SPEAKER_32]: Estimated number of vehicle trips per day to the store?

1281
01:45:51,009 --> 01:45:51,689
[SPEAKER_32]: Per day?

1282
01:45:52,190 --> 01:45:53,291
[SPEAKER_32]: No, per week or whatever you want.

1283
01:45:53,331 --> 01:45:53,772
[SPEAKER_32]: I can do math.

1284
01:45:53,792 --> 01:45:58,236
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I'll tell you what, per peak hour, what we looked at, two ways of doing this kind of thing.

1285
01:45:58,677 --> 01:46:02,701
[SPEAKER_21]: There's a national organization, the Institute of Transportation Engineers.

1286
01:46:03,282 --> 01:46:06,865
[SPEAKER_21]: They have data for all kinds of fast food or high turnover restaurants.

1287
01:46:07,606 --> 01:46:13,010
[SPEAKER_21]: We looked at that, but then we also took a look at actual raising canes, which was a little bit higher.

1288
01:46:13,630 --> 01:46:17,432
[SPEAKER_21]: And within those counts that we saw, we also took the highest one out of that.

1289
01:46:18,073 --> 01:46:24,297
[SPEAKER_21]: So we're up around 225 trips, roughly, during the busiest one hour of any day.

1290
01:46:24,317 --> 01:46:26,999
[SPEAKER_21]: That's half entering, half exiting.

1291
01:46:27,819 --> 01:46:36,846
[SPEAKER_21]: To put that in some kind of context, that's a little bit more than you'd probably see at a successful pharmacy chain, which I know City of Medford has several.

1292
01:46:38,307 --> 01:46:46,834
[SPEAKER_21]: One thing that's kind of unique to restaurant-oriented businesses like this is the majority of that traffic is what they call pass-by traffic.

1293
01:46:47,795 --> 01:46:52,698
[SPEAKER_21]: Certainly when Raising Cane's comes in, it's going to be new, it's going to be exciting, it's going to draw people in.

1294
01:46:53,619 --> 01:47:07,546
[SPEAKER_21]: Once it's established with these sort of restaurants, and it's not just Raising Cane's, it's the other national chains, this pass-by traffic are people that are coming home from work, five, six at night, pull in to grab their food, continue on their way.

1295
01:47:08,546 --> 01:47:11,227
[SPEAKER_21]: Either way, that traffic's driving by that site today.

1296
01:47:12,068 --> 01:47:17,170
[SPEAKER_21]: Now it just gives them an option to pull in, get some food on their way from work to home.

1297
01:47:17,570 --> 01:47:20,352
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's not increasing traffic to the area necessarily,

1298
01:47:21,223 --> 01:47:22,443
[SPEAKER_21]: That's the pass by traffic.

1299
01:47:22,604 --> 01:47:24,684
[SPEAKER_21]: Obviously there's going to be new traffic drawn.

1300
01:47:24,924 --> 01:47:26,305
[SPEAKER_21]: It's going to be a successful business.

1301
01:47:26,345 --> 01:47:40,391
[SPEAKER_21]: We certainly hope, but the amount of traffic generated through the traffic study we did, which was reviewed by the traffic and mobility department, they agreed that there were impacts to the project, but that they'd be confined to the site.

1302
01:47:40,791 --> 01:47:44,412
[SPEAKER_21]: And I can show you momentarily how we had planned on addressing those.

1303
01:47:45,833 --> 01:47:45,973
[SPEAKER_21]: So

1304
01:47:47,486 --> 01:47:56,968
[SPEAKER_32]: Based upon my math, that's like an average hour, we're looking at 1.8 to 1.9 vehicles in and out every hour.

1305
01:47:59,129 --> 01:48:00,469
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm sorry, every minute.

1306
01:48:00,809 --> 01:48:02,069
[SPEAKER_32]: Every minute, every minute.

1307
01:48:02,689 --> 01:48:03,610
[SPEAKER_32]: 1.9 every minute.

1308
01:48:03,830 --> 01:48:06,710
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, yeah, if it's 60 minutes, so.

1309
01:48:06,750 --> 01:48:07,791
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, 114 divided by.

1310
01:48:07,811 --> 01:48:08,671
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, let's say two.

1311
01:48:09,451 --> 01:48:13,392
[SPEAKER_21]: And what we've also found through information from Raising Cane's,

1312
01:48:14,352 --> 01:48:20,896
[SPEAKER_21]: Some of the non canes restaurants we have more complicated meal orders being requested take longer times.

1313
01:48:21,556 --> 01:48:30,161
[SPEAKER_21]: Canes has been able to process people at the window or at the drive-thru spot where they're ordering and picking up closer to a 30 second, half minute.

1314
01:48:30,521 --> 01:48:32,482
[SPEAKER_21]: So they're able to run them through pretty quickly.

1315
01:48:33,360 --> 01:48:35,962
[SPEAKER_21]: And I say quickly, but more importantly, it's orderly.

1316
01:48:36,383 --> 01:48:39,345
[SPEAKER_21]: It's all in a counterclockwise direction around the building.

1317
01:48:39,966 --> 01:48:44,110
[SPEAKER_21]: So the numbers manageable, the drive through has been designed to handle that.

1318
01:48:44,790 --> 01:48:47,453
[SPEAKER_21]: And we also have the parking obviously to create that balance.

1319
01:48:52,418 --> 01:49:03,224
[SPEAKER_21]: If I could jump forward to just actually kind of a visual to help, don't have to spend a lot of time on this one, but this is an actual visual showing one of these facilities down in Houston.

1320
01:49:04,064 --> 01:49:10,648
[SPEAKER_21]: What you're looking at is the canopy extending from the window, which is the darker area that you can see in the center of the graphic.

1321
01:49:11,428 --> 01:49:15,433
[SPEAKER_21]: and the two lanes which would be approaching you, one on each side of the columns.

1322
01:49:16,194 --> 01:49:26,526
[SPEAKER_21]: That's just a visual just to show you what it is, the canopy standard practice, so no one's getting wet, picking up their food, and the architecturals we'll speak to in a moment as well.

1323
01:49:28,749 --> 01:49:29,329
[SPEAKER_21]: Next visual.

1324
01:49:32,006 --> 01:49:37,748
[SPEAKER_21]: And this is a little bit busy of a graphic because it's kind of a busy area in terms of what's going on.

1325
01:49:37,768 --> 01:49:42,550
[SPEAKER_21]: There's a lot going on out here and a lot of it actually is gonna be pretty good now.

1326
01:49:42,590 --> 01:49:50,773
[SPEAKER_21]: There's improvements that were put in place recently by the BioLife project within the plaza a couple summers ago.

1327
01:49:51,553 --> 01:49:59,896
[SPEAKER_21]: They put up a speed feedback sign in Riverside Avenue, did some bike improvements both in the form of bike lanes and bike racks within the plaza.

1328
01:50:00,896 --> 01:50:16,770
[SPEAKER_21]: A little bit above and beyond that, from talking to the city mobility department, the city's actually planning resurfacing and other associated improvements along Riverside Avenue, essentially for the length of the plazas frontage, as we're seeing here right now.

1329
01:50:17,430 --> 01:50:20,973
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's going to be addressing some of the deficiencies that are out there today.

1330
01:50:22,615 --> 01:50:27,159
[SPEAKER_21]: One of those, I guess I should note right off the top and we'll zoom in on it momentarily.

1331
01:50:28,220 --> 01:50:33,285
[SPEAKER_21]: The driveway to the plaza on Riverside Avenue is pretty close to route 28 Felsway.

1332
01:50:33,945 --> 01:50:40,511
[SPEAKER_21]: There's striping out there kind of diagonal pavement markings indicating what's called do not block the box.

1333
01:50:41,312 --> 01:50:42,493
[SPEAKER_21]: Don't block the intersection.

1334
01:50:43,774 --> 01:50:52,921
[SPEAKER_21]: The striping is a little bit faded, that's going to be covered through the city's project, but from talking to city staff they felt it would be beneficial to amplify that a little bit.

1335
01:50:53,742 --> 01:50:56,444
[SPEAKER_21]: To do that we're going to be installing a flashing sign.

1336
01:50:57,264 --> 01:51:00,887
[SPEAKER_21]: So when the traffic backs up from the signal at Riverside.

1337
01:51:01,548 --> 01:51:02,828
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, Riverside and route 28.

1338
01:51:02,929 --> 01:51:05,470
[SPEAKER_21]: It's going to turn this flashing sign on.

1339
01:51:06,291 --> 01:51:06,792
[SPEAKER_21]: to the intersection.

1340
01:51:06,812 --> 01:51:07,993
[SPEAKER_21]: Indicating red signal ahead.

1341
01:51:08,554 --> 01:51:10,015
[SPEAKER_21]: Do not block the intersection.

1342
01:51:10,256 --> 01:51:14,981
[SPEAKER_21]: Something to that effect just to bring additional driver awareness to the condition.

1343
01:51:15,001 --> 01:51:16,944
[SPEAKER_21]: Um within the

1344
01:51:23,191 --> 01:51:27,575
[SPEAKER_21]: The right and bottom edges of the site new sidewalk just to make it walkable.

1345
01:51:28,616 --> 01:51:39,005
[SPEAKER_21]: DCR, which controls the route 28 Riverside intersection is in the process of making some walkability improvements at that location, and these will tie into that rather nicely.

1346
01:51:40,366 --> 01:51:41,987
[SPEAKER_21]: consistent with that idea.

1347
01:51:42,007 --> 01:51:45,729
[SPEAKER_21]: And the city's traffic department was not just focused on cars.

1348
01:51:46,290 --> 01:51:50,572
[SPEAKER_21]: They were also very concerned with making sure pedestrian safety was put to the front.

1349
01:51:52,213 --> 01:52:00,678
[SPEAKER_21]: DCR, as I mentioned, is doing work out here, but we're going to be building upon that, adding new crosswalks across the driveways shown on the screen.

1350
01:52:01,818 --> 01:52:16,504
[SPEAKER_21]: One of them is a little bit unique on the right just by the route 28 label where it's a signalized enter only driveway but the pedestrians are left to fend for themselves and they'll show you momentarily how that condition is going to be addressed.

1351
01:52:17,384 --> 01:52:20,405
[SPEAKER_21]: Maybe if we jump ahead one we can just get right into that now.

1352
01:52:21,426 --> 01:52:24,087
[SPEAKER_21]: Just kind of wrapping up some of the higher level improvements here.

1353
01:52:24,927 --> 01:52:28,268
[SPEAKER_21]: So again, this is looking from 28 into the plaza.

1354
01:52:28,789 --> 01:52:32,550
[SPEAKER_21]: This would be one potential access route for someone coming to the restaurant.

1355
01:52:33,151 --> 01:52:45,096
[SPEAKER_21]: And again, pedestrians are really left on their own in this case so we're going to be signalizing that crossing putting in a very clear crosswalk ADA accommodations as well.

1356
01:52:45,896 --> 01:52:48,559
[SPEAKER_21]: and that's something city staff felt strongly about.

1357
01:52:48,639 --> 01:52:49,960
[SPEAKER_21]: We're happy to put it in place.

1358
01:52:49,980 --> 01:52:57,307
[SPEAKER_21]: It's probably more complicated than it sounds, but it has some pretty significant safety benefits, which is why we're doing it.

1359
01:52:58,548 --> 01:53:05,194
[SPEAKER_21]: Similarly, on the next one, if I could jump ahead, we had talked about this earlier, the do not block the box striping.

1360
01:53:06,035 --> 01:53:11,059
[SPEAKER_21]: Again, limited effectiveness today, so we're going to be putting pretty much right at the

1361
01:53:12,820 --> 01:53:20,402
[SPEAKER_21]: that intersection, flashing sign, which one traffic backs up to that point, clearly alerting motorists that something has changed.

1362
01:53:20,462 --> 01:53:21,943
[SPEAKER_21]: They should not be in that area.

1363
01:53:22,643 --> 01:53:29,685
[SPEAKER_21]: And just keeping that open because I know today that's a point of frustration for many people having that intersection blocked.

1364
01:53:30,365 --> 01:53:31,685
[SPEAKER_21]: So we're going to be doing that.

1365
01:53:31,865 --> 01:53:34,286
[SPEAKER_21]: We're also providing within the plaza.

1366
01:53:34,306 --> 01:53:40,928
[SPEAKER_21]: I should have mentioned earlier way finding signage where it's a little bit confusing if you're not from the area to know exactly

1367
01:53:41,488 --> 01:53:43,251
[SPEAKER_21]: how to get out of the plaza once you're in.

1368
01:53:43,852 --> 01:53:48,921
[SPEAKER_21]: So we're going to be promoting them to get out of the plaza through means other than this driveway.

1369
01:53:50,859 --> 01:53:54,762
[SPEAKER_21]: again, this was a very comprehensive, detailed traffic study.

1370
01:53:55,663 --> 01:54:04,729
[SPEAKER_21]: City staff did review it thoroughly, and we came to an agreement that's what's shown up there is what we should be doing, along with the internal layout that was shown.

1371
01:54:05,849 --> 01:54:13,575
[SPEAKER_21]: Be happy to take questions as the night goes on, but I think would do well now to shift to the architecture, just so everyone can see what we're proposing.

1372
01:54:14,215 --> 01:54:15,596
[SPEAKER_21]: And thank you all for your time.

1373
01:54:23,112 --> 01:54:35,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, thank you again for having us I'm just going to walk through very briefly some of the details of the architectural elevations and Jeff I know that you're manning the zoom now as well so if you have any comments to chime in please feel free.

1374
01:54:36,543 --> 01:54:40,006
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just take you briefly in the top right or top left hand corner.

1375
01:54:40,786 --> 01:54:41,807
[SPEAKER_03]: the front elevation.

1376
01:54:42,508 --> 01:54:51,115
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the notable items to speak about here is the one love mural that we have typically at every location.

1377
01:54:52,036 --> 01:55:01,964
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd like to include the city name for that for that mural as well so that we can feel a part of the community that we're coming into.

1378
01:55:01,984 --> 01:55:08,790
[SPEAKER_03]: You can also note that any of the HVAC equipment that would potentially be able to be visible on the roof

1379
01:55:09,250 --> 01:55:11,252
[SPEAKER_03]: is actually shaded in.

1380
01:55:11,292 --> 01:55:17,317
[SPEAKER_03]: We have some barriers that would help us to not make that an eyesore.

1381
01:55:17,997 --> 01:55:25,083
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also an ample amount of window space for the natural light, as well as that would technically be our patio area as well.

1382
01:55:26,459 --> 01:55:29,381
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to move over to the rear elevation to the right.

1383
01:55:30,302 --> 01:55:36,747
[SPEAKER_03]: We can also zoom in there and you can see a little bit of what you would typically see in our drive through when you're waiting for your food.

1384
01:55:37,548 --> 01:55:48,696
[SPEAKER_03]: That area there is also shaded off and that would typically be the dumpster enclosure where we would keep our trash and have pretty much a staging area for the employees as they work through the drive through.

1385
01:55:50,258 --> 01:55:53,020
[SPEAKER_03]: The drive through elevation if we want to touch on that now.

1386
01:55:54,061 --> 01:55:59,206
[SPEAKER_03]: The, you will also see the painted arrow mural, which helps to semi direct traffic.

1387
01:56:00,327 --> 01:56:04,931
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a nice colorful addition to a that brick wall side that we have there.

1388
01:56:05,552 --> 01:56:08,394
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can also see the pickup windows that are shown.

1389
01:56:08,755 --> 01:56:10,116
[SPEAKER_03]: This is our typical prototype.

1390
01:56:10,356 --> 01:56:11,017
[SPEAKER_03]: the prototype.

1391
01:56:11,037 --> 01:56:24,572
[SPEAKER_03]: So we would typically have the two windows on either side, just in case we need to either take an order if it's very busy during peak times, or if it slows down, we would just direct traffic to the the pickup window to your right questions.

1392
01:56:25,333 --> 01:56:43,980
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, finally, the side entry elevations you will see our typical red dog banner, we'd like to have that at every Kane's location and all of the signage is going to be submitted separately from our signage vendor, we will keep in mind all of the comments that have come up tonight about the signage as well.

1393
01:56:44,860 --> 01:56:48,722
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is just another view of the side of our patio area.

1394
01:56:49,602 --> 01:56:53,303
[SPEAKER_03]: and I did want to just touch on the fact that we do include a lot of landscaping.

1395
01:56:53,623 --> 01:57:04,846
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it was mentioned earlier from Eric, but we do spend a lot of time on that, and we do pride ourselves on making sure that yearly and throughout the year that we're able to maintain a fresh look.

1396
01:57:05,527 --> 01:57:10,468
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to give back to the community as much as they give back to us, so we like to keep it better than we found it.

1397
01:57:12,248 --> 01:57:18,050
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, if there was anything, Jeff, on your end that I may have missed, please feel free to chime in.

1398
01:57:21,089 --> 01:57:21,429
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1399
01:57:21,449 --> 01:57:27,051
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is Jeff Poutney, ADA Architects, 17710 Detroit Avenue.

1400
01:57:27,071 --> 01:57:40,435
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, just to mention on the exterior portion, we do use multiple different finishes around the perimeter to break it up, make it pleasing to the customers, different types of brick to different colors.

1401
01:57:41,335 --> 01:57:45,777
[SPEAKER_00]: As mentioned, all the glazing, we do have also accenting around the drive-thru.

1402
01:57:46,918 --> 01:58:00,191
[SPEAKER_00]: A Nichiha panel, again different materials throughout as well as the car panel red one that is our tradition for our one love around the corral on the back again attracts material.

1403
01:58:00,671 --> 01:58:08,079
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are all nice colors complimenting each other, as well just providing an overall nice feature to the overall building.

1404
01:58:09,463 --> 01:58:13,227
[SPEAKER_00]: as mentioned on the next slide here, is the enlargement of the different materials.

1405
01:58:13,747 --> 01:58:17,010
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it's just not a box of one type of material.

1406
01:58:17,030 --> 01:58:20,574
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, again, a very pleasing aesthetics to the customer.

1407
01:58:27,005 --> 01:58:29,488
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I just ask one specific question about the building?

1408
01:58:29,968 --> 01:58:34,954
[SPEAKER_08]: The roofing color, is it light or is it a black roof?

1409
01:58:36,476 --> 01:58:41,202
[SPEAKER_00]: The roof itself is a white TPO roofing, so it reflects lighting for energy as well.

1410
01:58:42,803 --> 01:58:43,284
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, thank you.

1411
01:58:43,304 --> 01:58:44,646
[SPEAKER_08]: That was what my question was based in.

1412
01:58:44,686 --> 01:58:44,946
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1413
01:58:45,652 --> 01:59:01,298
[SPEAKER_38]: So, as a morale that will conclude our presentation with regard to the fact I would say at this point that we did work with staff, and those recommendations, and also the conditions that we agreed to are all in the recommendation of

1414
01:59:01,838 --> 01:59:03,259
[SPEAKER_38]: of the Community Development Board.

1415
01:59:04,420 --> 01:59:15,045
[SPEAKER_38]: We worked very closely with traffic and I think there's some very nice improvements to the center based on the collaboration between Todd Blake and our team.

1416
01:59:15,586 --> 01:59:24,811
[SPEAKER_38]: Specifically that crosswalk over 28 where traffic comes in is I think a very important safety precaution that we have agreed to take.

1417
01:59:25,591 --> 01:59:30,254
[SPEAKER_38]: In terms of the loading area just to close I know that there are many items on tonight.

1418
01:59:31,635 --> 01:59:51,486
[SPEAKER_38]: When we looked at that we looked at something that would would protect pedestrians, we wouldn't have a parking lot full of people I think we would have qualified under 6.7 for the four spaces that already exist on the southerly side of the building, but then you'd have to track product from from that loading dock across the parking lot which creates more of a hazard.

1419
01:59:51,926 --> 01:59:53,728
[SPEAKER_38]: to traffic as well as pedestrians.

1420
01:59:54,128 --> 02:00:03,438
[SPEAKER_38]: In addition, the petitioner certainly will agree to no idle and condition that trucks be shut off immediately when they are brought to the site for the duration of the time that they are there.

1421
02:00:03,458 --> 02:00:04,900
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

1422
02:00:05,080 --> 02:00:05,320
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

1423
02:00:06,707 --> 02:00:08,348
[SPEAKER_08]: you want to take your questions first?

1424
02:00:08,448 --> 02:00:10,289
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I just have some questions.

1425
02:00:10,569 --> 02:00:10,870
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1426
02:00:10,890 --> 02:00:25,279
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know we can answer these questions, Miss Desmond, but I think that the points that were brought up that I want to bring forth as we move on, I think that we're, I think,

1427
02:00:26,388 --> 02:00:33,753
[SPEAKER_16]: any community that has a reputable establishment like raising canes to come into community I think it's a plus.

1428
02:00:34,674 --> 02:00:46,422
[SPEAKER_16]: But I also think that the most important pieces is understanding what the neighbors that really about that location, and how that affects them and I think that that's why these are the questions that I have right now.

1429
02:00:47,803 --> 02:00:59,371
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, I've gone back and forth with different neighbors, and they've called me back and forth, and the talk of using Dunkin' Donuts as an example, being open, having the drive-through, and so on and so forth.

1430
02:00:59,411 --> 02:01:04,655
[SPEAKER_16]: But I think that what's different with this is when they bought their homes, it was always an establishment.

1431
02:01:04,695 --> 02:01:07,096
[SPEAKER_16]: There was Mr. Donut, Dunkin' Donuts, there was something always there.

1432
02:01:07,576 --> 02:01:11,819
[SPEAKER_16]: So this is an establishment that's coming in with established families and homes that are there.

1433
02:01:11,899 --> 02:01:16,422
[SPEAKER_16]: So I just want to just express what neighbors have called me about.

1434
02:01:17,664 --> 02:01:23,537
[SPEAKER_16]: One being, you know, the issues are going to have a noise, adding patrons at one in the morning.

1435
02:01:24,193 --> 02:01:26,354
[SPEAKER_16]: usually they're not the quietest people in the world.

1436
02:01:26,434 --> 02:01:37,017
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, you know, you look at other takeout locations, you look at, for instance, Wendy's or Burger King, really don't about a neighborhood in that sense.

1437
02:01:37,097 --> 02:01:46,460
[SPEAKER_16]: So, but we've also had issues with noise in those locations, but now coming into a neighborhood and understanding that and presenting that.

1438
02:01:46,480 --> 02:01:52,322
[SPEAKER_16]: The other piece is the actual air conditioning units and the nerve,

1439
02:01:54,082 --> 02:01:58,143
[SPEAKER_16]: I know it's been mentioned before being on the on the subcommittee and chairperson for lighting and signs.

1440
02:01:58,163 --> 02:01:58,924
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's very important.

1441
02:02:20,050 --> 02:02:25,194
[SPEAKER_16]: a very tough time and making sure we abide by these certain issues and blinking lights.

1442
02:02:25,254 --> 02:02:32,020
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's great that we did these traffic mediations and all this stuff, but all you did now is we've added more lights.

1443
02:02:32,340 --> 02:02:33,241
[SPEAKER_16]: We've added more lights.

1444
02:02:34,362 --> 02:02:42,948
[SPEAKER_16]: So understanding how that is going to work with the neighbors and the people that have maybe a bedroom that abuts it maybe even 100 feet away.

1445
02:02:44,370 --> 02:02:45,651
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that's important.

1446
02:02:45,751 --> 02:02:46,331
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that,

1447
02:02:47,776 --> 02:02:59,661
[SPEAKER_16]: You know the traffic issues, the way the design shows I, I don't, I don't see a real issue with that with the flow that it shows really directed people away so I think that that isn't a big issue I don't I don't think.

1448
02:03:01,001 --> 02:03:04,323
[SPEAKER_16]: But then I don't know if people have told you in that area we have a huge.

1449
02:03:05,103 --> 02:03:06,044
[SPEAKER_16]: huge rodent issue.

1450
02:03:06,904 --> 02:03:12,949
[SPEAKER_16]: And now they're nervous that holy cow, we've had this rodent issue in this community and no one's responded to us.

1451
02:03:13,630 --> 02:03:15,291
[SPEAKER_16]: No one has come back to us.

1452
02:03:15,671 --> 02:03:20,615
[SPEAKER_16]: And they looked at different, they looked at stop and shop and different, you know, facilities that have food.

1453
02:03:21,035 --> 02:03:23,157
[SPEAKER_16]: Now you're bringing that 100 feet, 100 yards away from their home.

1454
02:03:24,838 --> 02:03:39,968
[SPEAKER_16]: an eating establishment so now the nerves are heightened, and I just wanted to bring that up as, as we proceed through this process that these are really the contacts of information I got from from residents in that area so, and I know you know, I'm sure you agree with me.

1455
02:03:40,408 --> 02:03:49,875
[SPEAKER_16]: These are very sensitive topics and they're very valuable but it's something as we move forward that I wanted to make sure I made after your presentation I brought that up because

1456
02:03:50,495 --> 02:03:54,718
[SPEAKER_16]: the residents that reached out to me, I told him, listen and watch the presentation.

1457
02:03:55,118 --> 02:04:03,064
[SPEAKER_16]: That's why I asked previously to Danielle, if there was really public participation, her comments were well, here's today's public participation.

1458
02:04:03,104 --> 02:04:09,788
[SPEAKER_16]: So that tells me we really didn't do much to really even though there were a couple of signs and we hit some of butters.

1459
02:04:10,349 --> 02:04:13,231
[SPEAKER_16]: The neighbors that I've talked to said they really weren't informed.

1460
02:04:13,271 --> 02:04:15,192
[SPEAKER_16]: So again, that's neither here nor there.

1461
02:04:15,232 --> 02:04:16,353
[SPEAKER_16]: That's not your fault or

1462
02:04:16,893 --> 02:04:21,016
[SPEAKER_16]: the city clerk this other reasons, but I just wanted to share that with you.

1463
02:04:22,437 --> 02:04:24,838
[SPEAKER_38]: If I, if I could with respect to the notice.

1464
02:04:25,659 --> 02:04:37,046
[SPEAKER_38]: Just in terms of we did have before we started this process community meeting and we did utilize the same notice that's that's utilized for this meeting today so we sent out notices to about us within 400 feet.

1465
02:04:38,267 --> 02:04:41,692
[SPEAKER_38]: And we had that meeting, and we didn't have any of those objections.

1466
02:04:42,733 --> 02:04:46,798
[SPEAKER_38]: If we had had some of that before maybe we could have allayed some of those concerns.

1467
02:04:46,878 --> 02:04:54,888
[SPEAKER_38]: Certainly, with respect to the, the roofing panels I think Jeff can probably speak to that Jeff, could you speak to the HVAC panels.

1468
02:04:56,283 --> 02:05:07,549
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the height of the roof around the entire perimeter not only screens visually the equipment, but also helps dissipate any noise from coming outwards from the building.

1469
02:05:08,269 --> 02:05:12,251
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do use high efficiency equipment, which again helps reduce any type of noise.

1470
02:05:13,527 --> 02:05:20,850
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so I know that we've gone through this before with other facilities and other establishments.

1471
02:05:21,430 --> 02:05:28,112
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not, it's really aesthetic, it's not really set to hinder the decimal system, correct?

1472
02:05:28,132 --> 02:05:30,093
[SPEAKER_16]: Decimal level, is that correct?

1473
02:05:31,874 --> 02:05:41,117
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct, but the noise will not go outward from the building, it will more go upwards towards the sky, the way it's directed because the perimeter is enclosing all the equipment

1474
02:05:42,992 --> 02:05:43,212
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.

1475
02:05:43,792 --> 02:05:51,636
[SPEAKER_16]: But we've had some studies in the past that have shown that if it's not made as a deterrent where the

1476
02:05:57,159 --> 02:06:01,182
[SPEAKER_16]: the make of it isn't made to hinder the noise.

1477
02:06:01,883 --> 02:06:11,331
[SPEAKER_16]: It really, whether it's going up or down, this is, again, this is something new from the neighbors that live across the street on the other side, having, they don't know that until it's done.

1478
02:06:11,611 --> 02:06:12,932
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's why it's coming up here.

1479
02:06:13,012 --> 02:06:23,782
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there a way that something that's aesthetic that can also be, you know, protected by, you know, with the noise level that they could do both?

1480
02:06:23,862 --> 02:06:24,042
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean,

1481
02:06:26,519 --> 02:06:27,620
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that something we can look at?

1482
02:06:27,640 --> 02:06:30,341
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know that this is these are things that the neighbors have asked.

1483
02:06:30,922 --> 02:06:37,666
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just really so we can look at the specifics for the decibel levels which we can get from the manufacturers.

1484
02:06:38,446 --> 02:06:42,048
[SPEAKER_00]: And many times the units have baffles and insulation inside of them.

1485
02:06:42,649 --> 02:06:47,732
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, not only for efficiency, but also for noise, but we can research into that for the decibel levels.

1486
02:06:52,074 --> 02:06:52,874
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1487
02:06:53,255 --> 02:06:56,456
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Madam President, thank you for the presentation.

1488
02:06:59,097 --> 02:07:05,220
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm glad to see we have a new business coming and something new that sort of big, even though you are the chain is not a big chain.

1489
02:07:05,720 --> 02:07:12,243
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been to your establishment before, and I agree with you, as far as training your customers.

1490
02:07:12,584 --> 02:07:13,084
[SPEAKER_10]: So one thing.

1491
02:07:14,566 --> 02:07:16,888
[SPEAKER_10]: You saw chicken fingers and soda and fries.

1492
02:07:17,349 --> 02:07:19,370
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no, there's no section of menu.

1493
02:07:20,091 --> 02:07:25,176
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, what I do have the problem with, um, is, you know, the hours of delivery.

1494
02:07:26,757 --> 02:07:34,744
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, and I don't want to beat the horse about the neighbors, but 11 to one in the evening, um, Sunday to Friday or whatever, Sunday, Thursday.

1495
02:07:35,405 --> 02:07:36,586
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, that's a big problem for me.

1496
02:07:37,895 --> 02:07:46,983
[SPEAKER_38]: Well, in terms of in terms of the hour, so it's 11 just Sunday through Thursday would be 11 would be the operation would close, which is within the ordinance requirements.

1497
02:07:47,344 --> 02:07:51,467
[SPEAKER_38]: And then it would be one hour after that for purposes of delivery received.

1498
02:07:51,487 --> 02:07:54,230
[SPEAKER_38]: So it's midnight Sunday through through Thursday.

1499
02:07:54,390 --> 02:07:58,954
[SPEAKER_38]: And you know, we can we can put conditions in terms of not idling.

1500
02:08:00,095 --> 02:08:20,696
[SPEAKER_38]: and and those types of things but certainly in terms of pedestrian safety and even when you're going to have other vehicles and in the parking area the evening was we thought a better choice safety so much I mean what's what time does the restaurant open about 11 o'clock 11 and nine o'clock in the morning I'm sorry nine in the morning so why why couldn't they deliver in the morning

1501
02:08:20,836 --> 02:08:24,597
[SPEAKER_38]: But then you're navigating more traffic and more pedestrians at that point than in the evening.

1502
02:08:24,617 --> 02:08:33,880
[SPEAKER_38]: And I think that's why we asked for the extended hours, because you wouldn't have the conflict of other vehicles and people who are now entering the plaza for other business.

1503
02:08:34,441 --> 02:08:46,585
[SPEAKER_38]: And I think too that the distribution trucks, Melissa can answer this question, but I think some of them are shared with Panera as well, so that they're distributing the same product.

1504
02:08:46,965 --> 02:08:48,946
[SPEAKER_38]: And Panera is on that evening,

1505
02:08:50,086 --> 02:09:05,154
[SPEAKER_38]: delivery schedule so in terms of having the number of trucks that would be on premises, you would have one delivery that would go from and again, Melissa can confirm that but my understanding is that frequently they're the same distributor, that's just distributing product to them.

1506
02:09:05,995 --> 02:09:12,158
[SPEAKER_38]: So, in asking for the extended evening hours that was part of the, the thinking as well.

1507
02:09:13,939 --> 02:09:17,761
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you want to start serving food at nine o'clock in the morning or what time does the rest

1508
02:09:18,443 --> 02:09:23,725
[SPEAKER_38]: It's going to open at nine o'clock in the morning, and they will serve food at that point.

1509
02:09:23,985 --> 02:09:25,585
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, they will serve food.

1510
02:09:26,306 --> 02:09:34,348
[SPEAKER_10]: My other question is, and this has come up when other restaurants come up, their filter system for when you're frying food.

1511
02:09:36,509 --> 02:09:38,389
[SPEAKER_38]: I'd have to have Melissa address that question.

1512
02:09:38,409 --> 02:09:42,791
[SPEAKER_10]: That was a question we had when we were opening Panera and those other restaurants on the other side of the Smashburger.

1513
02:09:43,841 --> 02:09:44,322
[SPEAKER_03]: that's fine.

1514
02:09:44,882 --> 02:09:46,383
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to tag team this one.

1515
02:09:46,704 --> 02:09:55,771
[SPEAKER_03]: We do actually have a grease trap contract that we maintain to make sure that everything is cleaned out appropriately and that there's no smell.

1516
02:09:55,911 --> 02:10:03,618
[SPEAKER_03]: We also do have a pest control contract set in place, which is standard practice for us to ensure that we try and keep everything to a minimum.

1517
02:10:03,958 --> 02:10:11,364
[SPEAKER_03]: We also do have a very strict quality control standard within our crew members that are currently staffed at the restaurant.

1518
02:10:13,126 --> 02:10:25,378
[SPEAKER_03]: as well as periodically throughout their shift, they will have to go out into the parking area, just to make sure that it's clean of trash, that all of the enclosures that should be shut are shut.

1519
02:10:26,419 --> 02:10:30,022
[SPEAKER_03]: And another comment just to go along with the delivery.

1520
02:10:30,803 --> 02:10:34,186
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as the delivery trucks are concerned, I think it was mentioned previously, but

1521
02:10:35,247 --> 02:10:48,073
[SPEAKER_03]: We can instruct our drivers to not idle and to also shut off the trucks when they pull up so that we can do deliveries with a quieter decibel and so that there's not so much disruption for the community.

1522
02:10:48,473 --> 02:10:53,936
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's also something that we try to put in place to mitigate any of the comments that have come through.

1523
02:10:54,676 --> 02:10:55,997
[SPEAKER_10]: Where will the dumpsters be located?

1524
02:10:56,930 --> 02:10:58,731
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe it's on this side of the building.

1525
02:10:58,811 --> 02:11:09,595
[SPEAKER_03]: We have it tucked away and it is a enclosed trash area that the employees are going to be responsible for making sure that that's all taken care of.

1526
02:11:09,615 --> 02:11:10,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1527
02:11:11,295 --> 02:11:15,917
[SPEAKER_10]: I know you were asking for a after hours permit, isn't it?

1528
02:11:16,733 --> 02:11:26,715
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know this, it's probably three or four rather, but I wouldn't get Kelly's has got a late primary, you get done the bonus 24 hours, you get 24 hours at CVS.

1529
02:11:27,016 --> 02:11:30,696
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not untypical for us to request a variance for hours.

1530
02:11:30,856 --> 02:11:40,459
[SPEAKER_03]: However, with this type of situation in this specific area, we felt that it was best for our crew members' safety to do it when it wasn't so congested as far as traffic is concerned.

1531
02:11:40,819 --> 02:11:43,379
[SPEAKER_10]: No, but I'm talking about the- For deliveries.

1532
02:11:43,840 --> 02:11:44,740
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, there's a deliveries.

1533
02:11:46,172 --> 02:11:50,737
[SPEAKER_10]: But the after hours permit, like I said, there's several in the area.

1534
02:11:52,399 --> 02:11:59,126
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think one of the concerns, when Wendy's came in, I know you're gonna have outdoor dining, outside seating.

1535
02:11:59,586 --> 02:12:03,631
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we made Wendy's come in and take, to stop the outside dining at a certain hour.

1536
02:12:04,466 --> 02:12:19,741
[SPEAKER_03]: And we would typically do that here as well if we have that hours extension just for deliveries, we will not be able, we will not make sure that we will make sure that there are no customers in the store at that time so that we can appropriately close down and keep the noise to a minimum.

1537
02:12:23,188 --> 02:12:26,831
[SPEAKER_10]: The other issue with the late hours is you're gonna have cars loitering in the parking lot.

1538
02:12:27,471 --> 02:12:28,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Say that one more time, sir.

1539
02:12:28,332 --> 02:12:29,773
[SPEAKER_10]: Cars loitering in the parking lot.

1540
02:12:30,334 --> 02:12:33,857
[SPEAKER_03]: We, again, we do try to- That's nothing, that's out of your control.

1541
02:12:33,877 --> 02:12:34,857
[SPEAKER_03]: It is out of our control.

1542
02:12:34,898 --> 02:12:38,360
[SPEAKER_03]: And unfortunately, if we could, we would try and maintain that the best that we can.

1543
02:12:38,380 --> 02:12:40,542
[SPEAKER_10]: People are gonna be eating, leaving trash on the blocks.

1544
02:12:41,022 --> 02:12:49,229
[SPEAKER_03]: And that goes along with the crew members walking around and patrolling the parking area to make sure that there's no trash and that everything is the way that it's supposed to be.

1545
02:12:49,249 --> 02:12:50,090
[SPEAKER_10]: Will they be doing that after hours?

1546
02:12:50,550 --> 02:12:58,154
[SPEAKER_03]: they will be doing it as their staff members on site the delivery drivers wouldn't necessarily be doing delivery guys but when you want to you want to permit to one o'clock.

1547
02:12:58,794 --> 02:12:59,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.

1548
02:12:59,214 --> 02:13:08,738
[SPEAKER_10]: If there's if there's members on site, I pull up at 401 and get some stuff and I'm not I'm not with my friends and we're going to sit in the parking lot and eat them.

1549
02:13:09,799 --> 02:13:12,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, I don't think we have any way to control that.

1550
02:13:12,260 --> 02:13:13,100
[SPEAKER_10]: That's something you control.

1551
02:13:13,120 --> 02:13:14,081
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's that's an issue.

1552
02:13:14,241 --> 02:13:15,121
[SPEAKER_10]: Understood.

1553
02:13:15,141 --> 02:13:18,443
[SPEAKER_10]: With the way they're going to be eating and leaving stuff in the parking lot.

1554
02:13:18,928 --> 02:13:26,213
[SPEAKER_38]: If I could, the hours of operation that we're asking for on only Friday and Saturday is until midnight.

1555
02:13:26,673 --> 02:13:31,917
[SPEAKER_38]: So we're not seeking a special permit of extended hours at all to 1 p.m.

1556
02:13:32,297 --> 02:13:33,458
[SPEAKER_38]: for service and operation.

1557
02:13:35,379 --> 02:13:41,843
[SPEAKER_38]: Right, but in terms of the extended hour in terms of the operation component of it, it would only be Friday and Saturday until midnight.

1558
02:13:42,383 --> 02:13:49,928
[SPEAKER_38]: That extra hour is only for deliveries in the event this is correct, and you'll be closing 11 o'clock every other night.

1559
02:13:49,948 --> 02:13:50,328
[SPEAKER_10]: Correct.

1560
02:13:50,948 --> 02:13:52,990
[SPEAKER_10]: And, and then there's an hour up to the window.

1561
02:13:53,680 --> 02:13:54,040
[SPEAKER_38]: Correct.

1562
02:13:54,640 --> 02:13:56,021
[SPEAKER_10]: Other than a delivery service?

1563
02:13:56,501 --> 02:13:56,861
[SPEAKER_10]: Correct.

1564
02:13:56,881 --> 02:13:57,421
[SPEAKER_10]: At 12 o'clock?

1565
02:13:57,581 --> 02:13:57,901
[SPEAKER_38]: Correct.

1566
02:13:58,321 --> 02:14:03,162
[SPEAKER_38]: So that extra hour on Friday and Saturday is only till 1 a.m.

1567
02:14:03,222 --> 02:14:05,303
[SPEAKER_38]: is only that extra hour for delivery purposes.

1568
02:14:05,763 --> 02:14:09,824
[SPEAKER_38]: The restaurant will close at midnight on Friday and Saturday and 11 p.m.

1569
02:14:10,104 --> 02:14:11,844
[SPEAKER_38]: on Sunday through Thursday.

1570
02:14:11,864 --> 02:14:15,445
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, but you said that one hour was for delivery services only.

1571
02:14:15,585 --> 02:14:16,586
[SPEAKER_38]: Right, so it will be closed.

1572
02:14:16,866 --> 02:14:17,726
[SPEAKER_38]: The store will be closed.

1573
02:14:19,046 --> 02:14:21,067
[SPEAKER_10]: And did you talk about your rodent program?

1574
02:14:23,891 --> 02:14:26,853
[SPEAKER_10]: with because again, it's brought that up.

1575
02:14:27,613 --> 02:14:28,974
[SPEAKER_10]: There are rodents in the area.

1576
02:14:32,016 --> 02:14:45,303
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as our rodent protocols concerned, we do set up a national account with our pest control vendor, they come out do a survey to make sure that we have everything in place to keep it, you know, as clean as possible at all times.

1577
02:14:46,183 --> 02:14:49,344
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have a monthly contract with them.

1578
02:14:49,424 --> 02:14:57,387
[SPEAKER_03]: We can increase the frequency should there be any issues, but that's something that we also try to control as well with the amount of trash that we have.

1579
02:14:57,787 --> 02:15:00,428
[SPEAKER_03]: We try to keep that away as best as possible.

1580
02:15:01,068 --> 02:15:13,833
[SPEAKER_10]: And when the gentleman was talking about the traffic, rather than the truck coming down the Felsway and turning on the Riverside Avenue, why couldn't the truck come down Route 16 and get on the commercial so it doesn't have to go by any houses?

1581
02:15:15,604 --> 02:15:19,209
[SPEAKER_10]: There's an entrance on commercial street to get into the parking lot.

1582
02:15:22,702 --> 02:15:26,165
[SPEAKER_21]: Right, again, it's physically possible for them to do that.

1583
02:15:26,665 --> 02:15:31,369
[SPEAKER_21]: What I had talked about earlier was the delivery protocol, identifying the preferred route.

1584
02:15:32,050 --> 02:15:37,935
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, if this council decides they want them to come in another way, it's still ending up at Raising Cane, that's fine.

1585
02:15:38,395 --> 02:15:47,763
[SPEAKER_21]: What we were showing in the graphic that's now up on the screen is that the truck can navigate within that area, whether it's turning right into Raising Canes or left into Raising Canes.

1586
02:15:48,924 --> 02:15:49,785
[SPEAKER_21]: doesn't really matter.

1587
02:15:50,065 --> 02:15:52,647
[SPEAKER_21]: It's ending up at the same point in the same direction.

1588
02:15:53,728 --> 02:15:59,793
[SPEAKER_21]: What I was referring to was logically, and I think most of the other trucks in the area originate from Wellington Circle and come up 28.

1589
02:16:01,074 --> 02:16:12,123
[SPEAKER_21]: To your point, and this would be more of a Raising Cane's operational, if there's a desire to promote a different route, we could certainly look at that, but I know trucks can get into this plaza from a variety of points.

1590
02:16:12,443 --> 02:16:20,130
[SPEAKER_10]: Well Budweiser is right on Riverside Ave and all their trucks, they go to commercial so it keeps them off the residential streets.

1591
02:16:20,931 --> 02:16:25,255
[SPEAKER_10]: Just something to think of and say, that's a commercial road.

1592
02:16:26,747 --> 02:16:30,850
[SPEAKER_10]: And I said, maybe that's a better option than coming down the Fellsway and turning.

1593
02:16:31,390 --> 02:16:33,831
[SPEAKER_10]: And I said, it keeps one less truck off there.

1594
02:16:34,112 --> 02:16:36,753
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, strictly on the engineering end, I have no objection to it.

1595
02:16:36,773 --> 02:16:38,254
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if there's any greater.

1596
02:16:38,494 --> 02:16:39,635
[SPEAKER_10]: There's an entrance on commercial.

1597
02:16:39,935 --> 02:16:40,115
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1598
02:16:40,135 --> 02:16:43,717
[SPEAKER_10]: You get in there, I say, yeah, Budweiser there, you have Bacardi Foods there.

1599
02:16:44,138 --> 02:16:48,720
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have, there's plenty of commercial trucks that go down there, and there's no homes there that really bother anybody.

1600
02:16:49,961 --> 02:16:50,301
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1601
02:16:50,421 --> 02:16:51,782
[SPEAKER_21]: Point noted.

1602
02:16:52,002 --> 02:16:56,045
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I said, I think my biggest concern is the late hour delivery.

1603
02:16:57,910 --> 02:16:58,270
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1604
02:16:58,290 --> 02:16:59,871
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Collins.

1605
02:17:01,112 --> 02:17:01,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, President Rowe.

1606
02:17:01,852 --> 02:17:08,376
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate the thorough presentation that we've gotten and appreciate the targeted questions from my fellow Councilors.

1607
02:17:08,396 --> 02:17:10,577
[SPEAKER_05]: I mostly just have a point of clarification.

1608
02:17:11,237 --> 02:17:18,461
[SPEAKER_05]: All of the proposed traffic and pedestrian mitigation that we saw in the presentation, if this is approved, will all of those go forward?

1609
02:17:19,195 --> 02:17:34,432
[SPEAKER_38]: Yes, that's the agreement and in your materials you have the recommendations of the Community Development Board and attached to that is the representation of VHBS to the improvements that are going to be made that have been agreed on by the traffic engineer Todd Blake and our client.

1610
02:17:35,013 --> 02:17:38,938
[SPEAKER_38]: And actually, all of the department head comments are attached

1611
02:17:39,478 --> 02:17:53,036
[SPEAKER_38]: to your uh your recommendations so they're all there as to what we have agreed to including you know in terms of the board of health um they have a protocol that they want us to follow and and you know certainly we'll do what's required by the board of health in terms of pest control.

1612
02:17:53,766 --> 02:17:54,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Great, thank you very much.

1613
02:17:54,787 --> 02:17:56,469
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate the thoroughness there.

1614
02:17:56,509 --> 02:17:59,853
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's always helpful to see sign off from the CDB, from department heads.

1615
02:18:00,373 --> 02:18:03,797
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, to me, I think that this is something that I'm glad that we're starting the public hearing process about.

1616
02:18:03,857 --> 02:18:05,679
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a large commercial space.

1617
02:18:05,739 --> 02:18:07,581
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an underutilized part of the parking lot.

1618
02:18:07,601 --> 02:18:11,725
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it would be great to see another establishment here for residents to take advantage of.

1619
02:18:11,885 --> 02:18:12,086
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1620
02:18:12,526 --> 02:18:28,211
[SPEAKER_38]: And if I could just address Councilor Scarpelli's question about signage and lighting certainly, I think, Jeff, do you have the last slide, which shows what the lighting is it's all downward confined to the center it's the final piece there.

1621
02:18:29,271 --> 02:18:37,714
[SPEAKER_38]: So it's all down lighted into the center, and certainly will work with the city in terms of of signage that application has been put forth yet.

1622
02:18:39,906 --> 02:18:40,226
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1623
02:18:40,266 --> 02:18:49,710
[SPEAKER_08]: And Councilor Collins, just procedurally, in order to adopt the CD board conditions, we would just have the motion would have to be to approve with those conditions, so we just have to be specified.

1624
02:18:49,730 --> 02:18:53,992
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so as this is a public hearing, Vice President Bears.

1625
02:18:54,752 --> 02:18:56,833
[SPEAKER_24]: You did recognize me earlier when I raised my hand.

1626
02:18:56,853 --> 02:18:57,013
[SPEAKER_08]: Did I?

1627
02:18:57,033 --> 02:18:57,673
[SPEAKER_38]: It's been hours.

1628
02:18:58,334 --> 02:19:03,756
[SPEAKER_24]: Hi, Cathy, how are you?

1629
02:19:03,816 --> 02:19:07,758
[SPEAKER_24]: I have two questions just further on the pest control.

1630
02:19:09,642 --> 02:19:12,643
[SPEAKER_24]: it sounded like you're going to follow the road control ordinance.

1631
02:19:13,283 --> 02:19:14,063
[SPEAKER_24]: They have a vendor.

1632
02:19:14,083 --> 02:19:15,184
[SPEAKER_24]: The vendor is going to come out monthly.

1633
02:19:15,284 --> 02:19:18,925
[SPEAKER_24]: If there are issues, they are going to increase the frequency.

1634
02:19:19,485 --> 02:19:21,605
[SPEAKER_24]: And then also that it's going to be a requirement of the staff.

1635
02:19:21,625 --> 02:19:33,369
[SPEAKER_24]: And this is the part that I'm sorry, I forgot your name, but you may be able to answer this, that at several points during the day, the crew is going to go across the whole site and clean the whole site for waste.

1636
02:19:33,649 --> 02:19:34,249
[SPEAKER_24]: Is that correct?

1637
02:19:34,589 --> 02:19:35,109
[SPEAKER_24]: That's correct.

1638
02:19:35,769 --> 02:19:36,009
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

1639
02:19:37,290 --> 02:19:38,110
[SPEAKER_24]: That sounds

1640
02:19:40,448 --> 02:19:57,298
[SPEAKER_24]: I think I'm just going to once we get to the point suggest that we had one more condition, which is that your pest control vendor submits quarterly reports to the health department about the condition of the property, and that would allow our health department to actually make sure that you're following through on what you've committed to.

1641
02:19:57,318 --> 02:20:03,682
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, and I had one other question that may be for the transportation folks.

1642
02:20:04,883 --> 02:20:06,584
[SPEAKER_24]: It sounds like the on site piece

1643
02:20:09,051 --> 02:20:18,794
[SPEAKER_24]: As Councilor Scarpelli said seems to be reasonable but I think there's a concern that a resident has raised here, and that I've actually experienced many times about the

1644
02:20:19,892 --> 02:20:30,138
[SPEAKER_24]: when you're exiting Riverside Plaza onto Riverside Avenue, in between basically your site and the Panera Bread site, there's massive traffic backups all the time.

1645
02:20:31,338 --> 02:20:35,220
[SPEAKER_24]: Folks trying to turn left can't get out, the right is just constantly backed up.

1646
02:20:35,861 --> 02:20:40,383
[SPEAKER_24]: It seems to me the only mitigation in here is we're gonna repaint the don't block the box, which nobody follows anyway.

1647
02:20:41,924 --> 02:20:47,827
[SPEAKER_24]: And I'm just, is there more mitigation that I'm missing or is there, that's my one concern about the traffic here.

1648
02:20:48,988 --> 02:20:59,211
[SPEAKER_21]: Again, that was a detailed study so I didn't want to go too far into this but one of the big things going on the city independent of this project is going to be resurfacing Riverside Avenue.

1649
02:20:59,391 --> 02:21:13,316
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I haven't seen the plans for that yet this came up pretty late in the game, but I can tell from working out here since probably around 2000 I first started looking at this plaza Riverside Avenue has always been a problem because it's confusing how many lanes there are.

1650
02:21:13,916 --> 02:21:16,718
[SPEAKER_21]: Depending what time of day, there's three, there's four, there's two.

1651
02:21:16,818 --> 02:21:19,740
[SPEAKER_21]: It's just very, it's kind of a wild, wild west configuration.

1652
02:21:20,360 --> 02:21:24,803
[SPEAKER_21]: Having clear marked striping out there, get the traffic going a little bit more orderly.

1653
02:21:25,184 --> 02:21:32,228
[SPEAKER_21]: It's still going to be the same volume and you still are going to see backups just because of the nature of the signalized intersection with the Felsway.

1654
02:21:32,629 --> 02:21:35,611
[SPEAKER_21]: But it should be at least more orderly with that resurfacing.

1655
02:21:36,311 --> 02:21:40,133
[SPEAKER_21]: The striping by itself, the do not block the box is not a cure all.

1656
02:21:40,753 --> 02:21:44,854
[SPEAKER_21]: That's been out there for a few years and it definitely needs a little bit more amplification.

1657
02:21:45,795 --> 02:21:55,919
[SPEAKER_21]: City's traffic department, the traffic engineer himself actually came up with the idea that it would be great to have the interactive sign where when people are driving, they tend to zone out a little bit.

1658
02:21:56,059 --> 02:22:01,201
[SPEAKER_21]: Striping is great, signs are great, but he wanted something that would interact with the traffic signal.

1659
02:22:01,661 --> 02:22:03,482
[SPEAKER_21]: When the traffic starts to back up,

1660
02:22:04,082 --> 02:22:11,227
[SPEAKER_21]: You don't want to be that guy that suddenly finds yourself blocking a major access and egress point to the plaza on Riverside Avenue.

1661
02:22:11,827 --> 02:22:16,370
[SPEAKER_21]: This sign would now flash and kind of alert you that, hey, something's changing.

1662
02:22:17,331 --> 02:22:18,552
[SPEAKER_21]: Don't block the intersection.

1663
02:22:19,052 --> 02:22:22,775
[SPEAKER_21]: The exact wording of the sign could be just that, don't block intersection.

1664
02:22:22,875 --> 02:22:27,578
[SPEAKER_21]: It could be red light ahead, which was a suggestion, but it's a more interactive component

1665
02:22:28,078 --> 02:22:30,419
[SPEAKER_21]: that amplifies the condition.

1666
02:22:30,959 --> 02:22:37,001
[SPEAKER_21]: And when we say it's a lit sign, it only lights up when the traffic starts to back up towards that intersection.

1667
02:22:37,461 --> 02:22:39,742
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not something like a roadway light.

1668
02:22:39,862 --> 02:22:45,084
[SPEAKER_21]: It's just something you see it sometimes with red signal ahead is one on some roads.

1669
02:22:45,764 --> 02:22:48,885
[SPEAKER_21]: So that should be an improvement over what's out there today.

1670
02:22:49,705 --> 02:22:50,926
[SPEAKER_21]: not going to solve everything.

1671
02:22:51,306 --> 02:23:01,635
[SPEAKER_21]: And a very simple component we put in here, there's some blue arrows right around the center of the site, which we're showing, which we're going to wayfinding signage, basically directing people.

1672
02:23:02,075 --> 02:23:06,319
[SPEAKER_21]: You don't necessarily have to come out in Riverside Avenue at that driveway.

1673
02:23:06,739 --> 02:23:14,946
[SPEAKER_21]: You do have the option to come out just on the top of the Ocean State job lot, turn right onto commercial and come out at that signal.

1674
02:23:15,586 --> 02:23:19,711
[SPEAKER_21]: It still ends up at Riverside Avenue at one point, but not immediately next to the site.

1675
02:23:20,653 --> 02:23:24,237
[SPEAKER_21]: Any one of these things by themselves is not going to fix everything.

1676
02:23:24,798 --> 02:23:27,281
[SPEAKER_21]: All of them together is not going to fix everything.

1677
02:23:27,761 --> 02:23:32,247
[SPEAKER_21]: But these collective measures, when they add up, it helps to mitigate the condition.

1678
02:23:33,849 --> 02:23:37,792
[SPEAKER_21]: Felsway carries somewhere between 25 and 30,000 cars a day.

1679
02:23:38,413 --> 02:23:42,036
[SPEAKER_21]: DCR is doing their part trying to clean up that intersection a little bit.

1680
02:23:42,696 --> 02:23:50,462
[SPEAKER_21]: So combining all these together, the hope is that it's going to make things a little bit better than today with or without raising canes going in.

1681
02:23:52,324 --> 02:23:59,749
[SPEAKER_24]: That sounds like some progress, but do you think it would be possible to do additional wayfinding?

1682
02:23:59,830 --> 02:24:02,331
[SPEAKER_24]: So I guess I'll just get up and point to it.

1683
02:24:02,351 --> 02:24:02,552
[SPEAKER_20]: Sure.

1684
02:24:05,370 --> 02:24:12,232
[SPEAKER_24]: here when people are actually making the decision to go into that egress or to go somewhere else?

1685
02:24:12,452 --> 02:24:18,915
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, and Todd Blake, the traffic director, this was more just to illustrate in principle what we're doing.

1686
02:24:19,075 --> 02:24:31,599
[SPEAKER_21]: He needs to see, just like there's going to be official building plans and official civil engineering plans, we're going to add that component in, the wayfinding, just so for a driver not from Medford in this plaza, they have a clear path out of here.

1687
02:24:32,079 --> 02:24:37,163
[SPEAKER_21]: We're certainly not suggesting just those two signs, but it doesn't have to be 50, which is overkill.

1688
02:24:37,784 --> 02:24:45,289
[SPEAKER_21]: Clear directional signage, pushing them towards the Ocean State job lot or directing them to the other egress points further to the south.

1689
02:24:45,890 --> 02:24:47,731
[SPEAKER_21]: So we can certainly do something to that effect.

1690
02:24:47,791 --> 02:24:52,255
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's not just me, it's a group effort with the city's mobility department and engineering.

1691
02:24:52,645 --> 02:24:54,166
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, I think that's gonna be key.

1692
02:24:54,807 --> 02:25:02,392
[SPEAKER_24]: I understand the structural limitations of the area, but redirecting traffic away from that egress point is important.

1693
02:25:02,672 --> 02:25:07,735
[SPEAKER_24]: It sounds like there's also gonna be some improvements to try to stop blocking the egress point, and we'll see how they go.

1694
02:25:07,855 --> 02:25:19,763
[SPEAKER_24]: But yeah, I'm glad you brought up that this is happening in concert with the city resurfacing of that stretch of Riverside Avenue, because I think that's important to factor in here, too, that there's gonna be new pavement.

1695
02:25:19,904 --> 02:25:21,285
[SPEAKER_24]: And yeah, okay.

1696
02:25:22,691 --> 02:25:23,291
[SPEAKER_24]: That's all I have for now.

1697
02:25:23,311 --> 02:25:27,655
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Madam President.

1698
02:25:28,595 --> 02:25:33,339
[SPEAKER_10]: You talked about, did you say that the city is going to be resurfacing all of Riverside Avenue?

1699
02:25:33,899 --> 02:25:34,920
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know the limits.

1700
02:25:35,040 --> 02:25:38,142
[SPEAKER_21]: I do know Riverside Avenue, at least next to this property.

1701
02:25:38,442 --> 02:25:42,565
[SPEAKER_24]: So it's going, it's all the way from commercial, I'm sorry, not commercial.

1702
02:25:42,645 --> 02:25:50,031
[SPEAKER_24]: I think it's all the way from like hall all the way down to, to the Felsway, almost all the way to Locust.

1703
02:25:55,009 --> 02:26:01,794
[SPEAKER_10]: Part of the problem we hear all the time with the late night people in the neighborhoods is the problem with the delivery drivers.

1704
02:26:03,335 --> 02:26:08,559
[SPEAKER_10]: That seems to be really everyone's late night problem.

1705
02:26:08,599 --> 02:26:14,724
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are the kinds that, it's not the people that are coming in to get the thing.

1706
02:26:14,744 --> 02:26:20,609
[SPEAKER_10]: It seems to be that they don't have any respect for the roads around here and not just running around everywhere.

1707
02:26:21,349 --> 02:26:23,631
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're the problem.

1708
02:26:24,229 --> 02:26:26,191
[SPEAKER_10]: in the parking lot, speeding through the parking lot.

1709
02:26:26,571 --> 02:26:35,399
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's gonna have this, I think, there's gonna have to be some kind of control in that parking lot, because everyone's gonna be cutting through there now.

1710
02:26:35,759 --> 02:26:38,482
[SPEAKER_10]: It's gonna be a cut through to go all the way down to the other end.

1711
02:26:38,522 --> 02:26:45,568
[SPEAKER_10]: So is there any talk of controlling that or putting some type of maybe detail in there late night?

1712
02:26:47,176 --> 02:26:50,418
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm a police detail specific to this project.

1713
02:26:50,478 --> 02:26:57,623
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, that sort of thing might open and might happen in conjunction with the grand opening but on a regular basis.

1714
02:26:58,164 --> 02:27:03,267
[SPEAKER_21]: That's an entire Plaza matter, not something I know just read the three different owners of that Plaza.

1715
02:27:03,287 --> 02:27:03,527
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1716
02:27:04,068 --> 02:27:08,511
[SPEAKER_21]: So, that operational sort of issue I can't really speak to myself.

1717
02:27:09,711 --> 02:27:15,876
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a bigger point than just raising canes I guess is all I could offer any concerns with cutting through and such.

1718
02:27:17,102 --> 02:27:19,503
[SPEAKER_21]: and trying to police that I guess would be the point to that.

1719
02:27:20,103 --> 02:27:22,864
[SPEAKER_10]: And do you plan to dim the lights when it gets later in the evening?

1720
02:27:23,924 --> 02:27:25,005
[SPEAKER_21]: That I could not speak to it.

1721
02:27:25,025 --> 02:27:27,525
[SPEAKER_21]: I have to ask property management or raising canes.

1722
02:27:27,806 --> 02:27:29,166
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1723
02:27:29,186 --> 02:27:33,107
[SPEAKER_10]: So dim them a little bit so they're not as bright at 10, 11, 12 o'clock.

1724
02:27:33,307 --> 02:27:36,008
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll keep all the lights on.

1725
02:27:36,028 --> 02:27:41,530
[SPEAKER_03]: There will be a few that are still remaining on up until a certain hour.

1726
02:27:42,026 --> 02:27:44,407
[SPEAKER_03]: But I did want to speak to very quickly.

1727
02:27:44,727 --> 02:28:01,715
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, I did want to speak to very quickly the comment that you just had about the drivers cutting through the Felsway Plaza does have a security that goes through the area and also does... I'm just telling you the information that I have.

1728
02:28:01,755 --> 02:28:03,036
[SPEAKER_10]: But there's no one ever in the car.

1729
02:28:03,676 --> 02:28:06,777
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been, I've lived in my whole life that cars in the parking lot.

1730
02:28:06,797 --> 02:28:07,698
[SPEAKER_10]: There's really no one over there.

1731
02:28:07,938 --> 02:28:09,499
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll do everything that we can to try.

1732
02:28:09,599 --> 02:28:09,839
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1733
02:28:11,817 --> 02:28:11,997
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1734
02:28:12,277 --> 02:28:13,398
[SPEAKER_08]: I just have one quick question.

1735
02:28:13,418 --> 02:28:17,401
[SPEAKER_08]: One quick question, then we're going to open the public hearing.

1736
02:28:18,242 --> 02:28:19,563
[SPEAKER_08]: The shrubbery, the trees are being planted.

1737
02:28:19,603 --> 02:28:20,944
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a maintenance plan for that?

1738
02:28:21,044 --> 02:28:24,146
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I think a lot of businesses come in, they plant them some shrubs and then they die.

1739
02:28:24,226 --> 02:28:25,067
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'd just be curious.

1740
02:28:26,257 --> 02:28:32,946
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually pride ourselves on spending a good amount of money on this landscaping because we want to see it last just like our restaurant.

1741
02:28:33,006 --> 02:28:38,473
[SPEAKER_03]: So as far as that goes, we do have a plan in place to make sure that this stays as nice as possible throughout the year.

1742
02:28:38,854 --> 02:28:39,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

1743
02:28:39,314 --> 02:28:39,595
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1744
02:28:39,755 --> 02:28:41,177
[SPEAKER_08]: And same with the street trees.

1745
02:28:41,237 --> 02:28:42,318
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that something that?

1746
02:28:42,358 --> 02:28:42,539
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1747
02:28:43,079 --> 02:28:44,700
[SPEAKER_03]: anything that would be on our property.

1748
02:28:45,480 --> 02:28:45,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1749
02:28:45,860 --> 02:28:55,184
[SPEAKER_38]: If I could just add as well as part of the Community Development Board meeting, you'll note that this landscaping now goes beyond the 30,000 square foot site, which is the raising cane.

1750
02:28:55,564 --> 02:29:02,187
[SPEAKER_38]: So they've extended that landscaping through the Eastern Eastern Bank footing so that there's more landscaping.

1751
02:29:02,687 --> 02:29:03,267
[SPEAKER_38]: Great, thank you.

1752
02:29:04,753 --> 02:29:07,835
[SPEAKER_08]: Whereas this is a public hearing, we need to open it up.

1753
02:29:07,955 --> 02:29:14,999
[SPEAKER_08]: So I will open the public hearing, portion of the public hearing for anyone who would like to speak in favor of this petition.

1754
02:29:16,300 --> 02:29:24,686
[SPEAKER_08]: So speaking only in favor of this petition, assuming the petitioner, if anyone wants to, any of you say yes, you speak in favor of this, you are, yes, great.

1755
02:29:25,526 --> 02:29:25,846
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1756
02:29:26,487 --> 02:29:31,090
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyone else on Zoom or in person who would like to speak in favor of this petition?

1757
02:29:32,199 --> 02:29:35,783
[SPEAKER_08]: Jeff, if you could stop sharing the screen just so I can see everyone on zoom.

1758
02:29:37,104 --> 02:29:37,444
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1759
02:29:38,425 --> 02:29:39,907
[SPEAKER_08]: And we'd like to speak in favor of this position.

1760
02:29:41,108 --> 02:29:43,490
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing none, this portion of the public hearing is closed.

1761
02:29:43,510 --> 02:29:47,974
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyone who would like to speak in opposition, opposition of this petition?

1762
02:29:49,075 --> 02:29:50,497
[SPEAKER_08]: Just name and address for the record, please.

1763
02:29:51,027 --> 02:29:57,550
[SPEAKER_37]: Hi, my name is Chris Fiorello and I live directly across from where they're going to put this restaurant.

1764
02:29:59,351 --> 02:30:08,136
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm right on the corner of Riverside Ave and Felsway, and we have communicated about the rodents, which has become a major issue.

1765
02:30:09,677 --> 02:30:19,962
[SPEAKER_37]: The dumpsters for all the other stores are behind the dumpsters for this are going to be directly across from my house.

1766
02:30:21,543 --> 02:30:23,844
[SPEAKER_37]: I don't care how many times you pick up.

1767
02:30:25,168 --> 02:30:31,232
[SPEAKER_37]: Trash, unless those barrels are covered and covered tightly, there's going to be trash on those barrels.

1768
02:30:31,292 --> 02:30:33,013
[SPEAKER_37]: They're not going to be emptied every day.

1769
02:30:33,534 --> 02:30:35,715
[SPEAKER_37]: And the dumpsters are not going to be emptied every day.

1770
02:30:36,055 --> 02:30:39,878
[SPEAKER_37]: We are already being hit so hard on the Felsway.

1771
02:30:40,258 --> 02:30:50,585
[SPEAKER_37]: I've spent over $2,000 to have my front of my house all enclosed because of the rodents that are terrorizing our neighborhood since they tore up the Felsway.

1772
02:30:50,985 --> 02:30:55,048
[SPEAKER_37]: And now we're going to have more construction and more trash.

1773
02:30:55,948 --> 02:30:58,390
[SPEAKER_37]: And, you know, in the traffic.

1774
02:30:59,070 --> 02:31:07,795
[SPEAKER_37]: I mean, you can put as many flashing lights as you want, and bright stripes but people take a left off of onto Riverside Ave.

1775
02:31:08,535 --> 02:31:11,196
[SPEAKER_37]: And the only way if you're coming up Riverside Ave.

1776
02:31:13,444 --> 02:31:20,247
[SPEAKER_37]: get to my house is to eventually block that space that you're not supposed to block because people are coming out of the plaza.

1777
02:31:20,307 --> 02:31:27,411
[SPEAKER_37]: So you never get a chance to actually get to the light because people are continually coming from the plaza.

1778
02:31:27,931 --> 02:31:31,833
[SPEAKER_37]: So the traffic already is serious.

1779
02:31:31,853 --> 02:31:41,277
[SPEAKER_37]: I mean, I go all the way down to Wellington and go through the rotary and come around to come all the way back to my house because I can't get the Riverside Ave is so congested.

1780
02:31:41,917 --> 02:31:42,698
[SPEAKER_37]: So we have,

1781
02:31:44,369 --> 02:31:52,114
[SPEAKER_37]: Kids that are gonna be hanging out at night, because let's be honest, who's going through drive-thrus at a fast food place at night?

1782
02:31:52,574 --> 02:31:53,034
[SPEAKER_37]: It's kids.

1783
02:31:53,615 --> 02:31:56,096
[SPEAKER_37]: So they're gonna be sitting in their cars, they're gonna be making noise.

1784
02:31:56,196 --> 02:31:58,418
[SPEAKER_37]: My bedroom's right on across from that.

1785
02:32:00,639 --> 02:32:06,863
[SPEAKER_37]: I just don't see it being feasible to have people who are working there

1786
02:32:07,955 --> 02:32:11,059
[SPEAKER_37]: to be patrolling the parking lot.

1787
02:32:11,459 --> 02:32:12,320
[SPEAKER_37]: It's not safe for them.

1788
02:32:12,621 --> 02:32:17,687
[SPEAKER_37]: These kids are going to be working there, they're not going to go out there and tell cars full of kids, it's time to move along.

1789
02:32:18,828 --> 02:32:23,514
[SPEAKER_37]: So I'll be up at midnight calling the police and telling them to come and clear out the parking lot.

1790
02:32:25,379 --> 02:32:28,360
[SPEAKER_37]: So I'm not really sure how that is going to be controlled.

1791
02:32:29,201 --> 02:32:30,562
[SPEAKER_37]: Um, I mean, you've raised a point.

1792
02:32:30,622 --> 02:32:31,582
[SPEAKER_37]: People are going to hang out.

1793
02:32:31,622 --> 02:32:32,522
[SPEAKER_37]: The kids are going to hang out.

1794
02:32:32,542 --> 02:32:33,163
[SPEAKER_37]: The weather's nice.

1795
02:32:33,183 --> 02:32:41,106
[SPEAKER_37]: They're going to be out there chatting and making noise and blaring their radios and their cars that we already listened to with the red lights.

1796
02:32:42,207 --> 02:32:43,688
[SPEAKER_37]: So we've got more rats.

1797
02:32:44,950 --> 02:32:47,532
[SPEAKER_37]: more traffic and more noise.

1798
02:32:48,232 --> 02:32:58,059
[SPEAKER_37]: And it's not that I disrespect the fact that your organization is a good civil organization, but I'm just getting tired of getting hit with everything on the fell's way.

1799
02:32:58,920 --> 02:33:09,968
[SPEAKER_37]: And I don't know how you can make me feel better about the rodents that food brings, the noise and the traffic.

1800
02:33:12,671 --> 02:33:12,991
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1801
02:33:14,312 --> 02:33:16,632
[SPEAKER_08]: Anybody else who would like to speak in opposition of this paper?

1802
02:33:16,652 --> 02:33:20,253
[SPEAKER_33]: Name and address for the record, please.

1803
02:33:20,434 --> 02:33:22,534
[SPEAKER_33]: Nate Merritt, 373 Riverside Ave in Medford.

1804
02:33:23,074 --> 02:33:27,696
[SPEAKER_33]: It's not necessarily in opposition, but you don't have another option of like just questions.

1805
02:33:28,016 --> 02:33:30,197
[SPEAKER_33]: So that's why I'm doing it there in the opposition portion.

1806
02:33:31,797 --> 02:33:35,378
[SPEAKER_33]: So out of the city councilors, who here shops at stop and shop?

1807
02:33:37,359 --> 02:33:37,599
[SPEAKER_33]: Okay.

1808
02:33:38,399 --> 02:33:39,840
[SPEAKER_33]: Do you ever go out like five o'clock at night?

1809
02:33:42,148 --> 02:33:42,588
[SPEAKER_33]: have to work.

1810
02:33:42,789 --> 02:33:43,029
[SPEAKER_33]: Okay.

1811
02:33:43,509 --> 02:33:45,571
[SPEAKER_33]: Uh, some that live in the neighborhood do it's great.

1812
02:33:45,591 --> 02:33:46,291
[SPEAKER_33]: It's convenient.

1813
02:33:46,351 --> 02:33:48,913
[SPEAKER_33]: I live a half mile away just for, for the folks there.

1814
02:33:49,353 --> 02:33:49,974
[SPEAKER_33]: I love chicken.

1815
02:33:50,614 --> 02:33:51,575
[SPEAKER_33]: I love small business.

1816
02:33:51,595 --> 02:33:54,597
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm, I'm, I'm a big, you know, capitalist, you know, proponent.

1817
02:33:54,737 --> 02:33:55,638
[SPEAKER_33]: So yeah.

1818
02:33:56,179 --> 02:33:59,281
[SPEAKER_33]: Um, in fact, I like chicken so much that I've been to Chick-fil-A so many times.

1819
02:33:59,481 --> 02:34:00,742
[SPEAKER_33]: I know it's the other company, right?

1820
02:34:01,242 --> 02:34:03,524
[SPEAKER_33]: But they're awesome and they run a good operation.

1821
02:34:04,064 --> 02:34:10,049
[SPEAKER_33]: So I guess one of my questions for you is, are your peak hours going to be around that five o'clock, six o'clock dinner time?

1822
02:34:10,069 --> 02:34:10,109
[SPEAKER_33]: Uh,

1823
02:34:12,799 --> 02:34:18,182
[SPEAKER_33]: which there's already a traffic issue where that don't block the box is always blocked.

1824
02:34:18,783 --> 02:34:21,444
[SPEAKER_33]: It doesn't matter how many lines you put on there because nobody can move.

1825
02:34:21,484 --> 02:34:22,785
[SPEAKER_33]: It gets gridlocked to begin with.

1826
02:34:23,565 --> 02:34:30,349
[SPEAKER_33]: So without a higher level plan, I don't know how some lines are going to fix that issue.

1827
02:34:31,330 --> 02:34:35,672
[SPEAKER_33]: And then for those of us that just want to go to the grocery store, we'll turn down commercial av.

1828
02:34:35,852 --> 02:34:41,616
[SPEAKER_33]: There's some ways to get around there, but I can see that clogging up pretty quick if this place is successful, which I hope it is.

1829
02:34:42,620 --> 02:34:45,722
[SPEAKER_33]: I guess my other concern is the actual footprint.

1830
02:34:46,363 --> 02:34:50,986
[SPEAKER_33]: And again, I'm going to cite Chick-fil-A and Woburn because that place is a goldmine.

1831
02:34:51,387 --> 02:34:56,791
[SPEAKER_33]: And they have a really good operation, similar to what you're talking about with the two drive-through lanes.

1832
02:34:57,771 --> 02:34:58,752
[SPEAKER_33]: They've got their act together.

1833
02:34:59,012 --> 02:35:03,436
[SPEAKER_33]: And it's like a minute or two, if you do your online ordering, you can stop it.

1834
02:35:03,516 --> 02:35:05,537
[SPEAKER_33]: You literally can pull in, get your food, get out.

1835
02:35:05,877 --> 02:35:06,498
[SPEAKER_33]: It's wonderful.

1836
02:35:08,271 --> 02:35:12,334
[SPEAKER_33]: Do you have the right footprint to accommodate the traffic that you might see based on this?

1837
02:35:12,354 --> 02:35:16,057
[SPEAKER_33]: Someone did some market research and said, this is a good area to put one of these restaurants.

1838
02:35:16,117 --> 02:35:23,482
[SPEAKER_33]: And I don't know anywhere else you can get chicken besides Popeye's in Everett, which again has a one-sided access.

1839
02:35:23,542 --> 02:35:24,663
[SPEAKER_33]: It's difficult to get in there.

1840
02:35:25,483 --> 02:35:37,252
[SPEAKER_33]: But have you done the homework comparably to see that if you get the business like you get in Woburn, are you going to be able to accommodate it without causing a bigger problem to the neighborhood?

1841
02:35:39,990 --> 02:35:50,938
[SPEAKER_33]: I appreciate you Rick Councilor for addressing the commercial have entrance there's also another truck entrance right for stop and shop on 16.

1842
02:35:51,558 --> 02:35:55,661
[SPEAKER_33]: If you're coming from the south you can turn left and there's that that dumb little sign for stop and shop.

1843
02:35:56,221 --> 02:36:02,025
[SPEAKER_33]: This is turn right and go through the loading area for stop and shop and all those other businesses to that's another access.

1844
02:36:03,086 --> 02:36:03,346
[SPEAKER_33]: Right.

1845
02:36:03,726 --> 02:36:07,429
[SPEAKER_33]: So instead of just commercial where you have all the other, you know, 18 wheelers parked over.

1846
02:36:09,332 --> 02:36:13,115
[SPEAKER_33]: My final question is regarding the hours of operation.

1847
02:36:14,536 --> 02:36:20,320
[SPEAKER_33]: The other restaurants in the area it looks like they close up at nine or 10 o'clock at night on some nights and 11 on others.

1848
02:36:21,461 --> 02:36:32,209
[SPEAKER_33]: Do you think you're really going to have the business to drive having extended or require the permit all the way to having normal business till midnight, and then deliveries at one that you don't have in Boston.

1849
02:36:33,594 --> 02:36:39,916
[SPEAKER_33]: or BU, which quite honestly has a lot more young people that are probably hungry for chicken after 11 o'clock at night.

1850
02:36:42,416 --> 02:36:44,417
[SPEAKER_33]: So those are my comments.

1851
02:36:44,477 --> 02:36:47,778
[SPEAKER_33]: Hopefully you guys can take those into consideration and maybe we can get some questions answered.

1852
02:36:47,978 --> 02:36:48,318
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

1853
02:36:48,518 --> 02:36:48,798
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1854
02:36:49,979 --> 02:36:54,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyone else who would like to speak in opposition of the permit, either in person or on Zoom?

1855
02:36:58,401 --> 02:36:58,941
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing none.

1856
02:37:01,397 --> 02:37:03,160
[SPEAKER_08]: This portion of the public hearing is closed.

1857
02:37:03,400 --> 02:37:11,692
[SPEAKER_08]: It seems like we probably still have a few questions from Councilors, or if you want to respond to any of the questions that were raised from residents.

1858
02:37:14,026 --> 02:37:21,434
[SPEAKER_38]: And I may need Patrick to address some of the traffic concerns but first with regard to the hours of operation.

1859
02:37:22,856 --> 02:37:33,027
[SPEAKER_38]: Again, it's Sunday through Thursday is going to be 11 o'clock which is what the ordinance allows and it's only open for purposes of the delivery component from 11 to 12.

1860
02:37:34,028 --> 02:37:35,969
[SPEAKER_24]: Kathy, when we say that, I think we're getting a little confused.

1861
02:37:36,009 --> 02:37:39,870
[SPEAKER_24]: You mean the restaurant receiving deliveries of supplies?

1862
02:37:40,190 --> 02:37:40,390
[SPEAKER_38]: Right.

1863
02:37:40,610 --> 02:37:43,371
[SPEAKER_24]: Not like delivery orders going out to people.

1864
02:37:43,411 --> 02:37:43,691
[SPEAKER_38]: Correct.

1865
02:37:43,731 --> 02:37:46,092
[SPEAKER_38]: Delivery of supplies from 11 p.m.

1866
02:37:46,552 --> 02:37:47,112
[SPEAKER_38]: to midnight.

1867
02:37:47,792 --> 02:37:53,914
[SPEAKER_38]: The only hours of operation that is open and only until midnight, not till one in the morning, would be Friday and Saturday.

1868
02:37:54,334 --> 02:38:00,976
[SPEAKER_38]: Again, delivery supplies, if necessary, if needed, on a Saturday evening or a Friday evening from midnight to 1 a.m.

1869
02:38:03,838 --> 02:38:10,722
[SPEAKER_38]: You know, at the risk of insulting my client once, I asked about the Chick-fil-A, and it's a different phenomenon.

1870
02:38:11,122 --> 02:38:13,243
[SPEAKER_38]: And so, you know, they didn't make me feel badly.

1871
02:38:14,924 --> 02:38:16,785
[SPEAKER_38]: It's not the same level of

1872
02:38:17,529 --> 02:38:22,371
[SPEAKER_38]: of interest that the chick fil a draws.

1873
02:38:23,092 --> 02:38:35,938
[SPEAKER_38]: But in terms of handling the customer flow it's to two lanes are going to be open during impact, and it's not a situation where you have a window they actually have people out there live, taking

1874
02:38:36,798 --> 02:38:42,042
[SPEAKER_38]: the orders on their iPads and proceeding through so that it's a much quicker process.

1875
02:38:42,142 --> 02:38:46,104
[SPEAKER_38]: Also, I believe the Chick-fil-A may have more items on their menu.

1876
02:38:46,485 --> 02:38:53,549
[SPEAKER_38]: Part of the success of Raising Cane in terms of delivery times is that they only have the one love the chicken tender.

1877
02:38:53,630 --> 02:38:56,011
[SPEAKER_38]: So that's the only menu plus the two sides.

1878
02:38:56,051 --> 02:39:02,636
[SPEAKER_38]: So there isn't a whole lot of menu to kind of clutter up the drive-through line.

1879
02:39:03,556 --> 02:39:05,758
[SPEAKER_38]: In terms of the truck routes,

1880
02:39:06,458 --> 02:39:19,225
[SPEAKER_38]: For those extended hours certainly the applicant has no, no issue with if the city council wants to condition it on a different drive route through, you know that that can be accomplished we don't have an issue with that.

1881
02:39:20,045 --> 02:39:27,289
[SPEAKER_38]: But, but in terms of the extended hours and looking at pedestrian traffic and vehicle traffic.

1882
02:39:27,849 --> 02:39:34,993
[SPEAKER_38]: We thought that the evening hours would be a better approach than to have a morning approach where we're open at nine and you're going to have.

1883
02:39:35,733 --> 02:39:39,576
[SPEAKER_38]: you're going to have people in the parking lot at seven in the morning walking and whatnot.

1884
02:39:40,656 --> 02:39:42,637
[SPEAKER_38]: I believe those were the questions that were asked.

1885
02:39:42,677 --> 02:39:43,858
[SPEAKER_38]: I hope I responded to them.

1886
02:39:45,639 --> 02:39:46,480
[SPEAKER_24]: Any other questions?

1887
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:51,583
[SPEAKER_24]: Just the other one, I think, Kathy, was the sealing of the bins for rodent control.

1888
02:39:52,188 --> 02:39:54,690
[SPEAKER_38]: So the trash is picked up every day.

1889
02:39:55,770 --> 02:39:57,611
[SPEAKER_38]: So there is no days of trash.

1890
02:39:57,672 --> 02:39:59,493
[SPEAKER_38]: The dumpster is emptied on a daily basis.

1891
02:39:59,533 --> 02:40:04,996
[SPEAKER_38]: In addition, it's sealed the dumpster and has panels which are closed.

1892
02:40:06,157 --> 02:40:12,121
[SPEAKER_38]: So it's not an open dumpster that's going to be open to rodents and whatnot to be able to get into.

1893
02:40:12,461 --> 02:40:15,663
[SPEAKER_38]: And they do have the trash removed on a daily basis.

1894
02:40:15,843 --> 02:40:18,325
[SPEAKER_24]: And that includes any barrels that may be outside?

1895
02:40:20,046 --> 02:40:20,346
[SPEAKER_38]: Correct.

1896
02:40:20,842 --> 02:40:25,811
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, those are, are they, if you could just come to the microphone, sorry.

1897
02:40:28,174 --> 02:40:34,198
[SPEAKER_03]: So as far as the trash containers are concerned, they do have a lid that comes over the top that has to get secured.

1898
02:40:34,658 --> 02:40:40,923
[SPEAKER_03]: That is secured every time somebody puts something into the trash, that is protocol for them to shut that.

1899
02:40:41,003 --> 02:40:51,510
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we also have the outside enclosure, which also has an extra layer to prevent any trash from, you know, if it happens to fall out of the trash can, it's staying with

1900
02:40:52,330 --> 02:41:04,958
[SPEAKER_03]: that small area that we have for the trash enclosure, you mean like actual trash receptacles that like a patron would use, we wouldn't have none of that would be outside of the contained area that is all under that coverage.

1901
02:41:05,818 --> 02:41:09,501
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, so so like even like a barrel out by the front door is as closing.

1902
02:41:10,071 --> 02:41:19,597
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we, I don't think that we would have that in this situation but as if you're speaking of barrels in regards to our just like a trash receptacle of some kind that I like that's not the dumpster.

1903
02:41:20,077 --> 02:41:33,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so a trash receptacle if it's on the outside, again that goes along with our quality standards where our employees there outside would be maintaining that and making sure that that gets picked up and put into the actual enclosure that

1904
02:41:34,585 --> 02:41:49,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so anything that would be outside that has trash in it would have to make its way to that large enclosure that would have to be covered by the sliding doors that we would put over top of the enclosure to make sure everything's contained.

1905
02:41:49,555 --> 02:41:49,735
[SPEAKER_24]: Right.

1906
02:41:49,815 --> 02:41:55,079
[SPEAKER_24]: And I guess I'm just asking like, you know, you may see on the sidewalk like, I mean, this is Medford we have

1907
02:41:55,879 --> 02:42:01,863
[SPEAKER_24]: trash bins and the door, you open the door you put something in you close it versus you may have a trash bin where there's like an open.

1908
02:42:03,064 --> 02:42:09,828
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure that we can look into, you know, different trash receptacles to make sure that that anything that's in there that's refuse would stay maintained.

1909
02:42:10,308 --> 02:42:16,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, but we know there's not just like an open thing where Iraq can jump and I'm sure if that was a condition we will.

1910
02:42:16,572 --> 02:42:17,413
[SPEAKER_30]: We will do that.

1911
02:42:17,513 --> 02:42:17,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1912
02:42:18,814 --> 02:42:19,614
[SPEAKER_30]: For information.

1913
02:42:19,834 --> 02:42:21,916
[SPEAKER_30]: Councilman, what time is trash pickup normal.

1914
02:42:23,519 --> 02:42:33,288
[SPEAKER_03]: It varies by location, but I can certainly confirm exactly depending on the delivery service.

1915
02:42:33,748 --> 02:42:36,191
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really just dependent on the trash delivery.

1916
02:42:36,291 --> 02:42:42,597
[SPEAKER_30]: With the passage of an extended hours permit, could the trash pickup extend to the extended hours that were approved?

1917
02:42:42,617 --> 02:42:42,937
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.

1918
02:42:44,198 --> 02:42:48,422
[SPEAKER_03]: If we had requested a certain time for them to come pick up the trash, I'm sure we could try and coordinate that.

1919
02:42:48,682 --> 02:42:51,463
[SPEAKER_30]: because I'd like to put some restrictions around when the trash can be picked up.

1920
02:42:51,523 --> 02:42:55,725
[SPEAKER_30]: If in fact the permit's going to pass, it's going to allow them to operate to this late an hour in a residential neighborhood.

1921
02:42:55,745 --> 02:43:00,227
[SPEAKER_30]: Madam President, the last thing we want to hear is dumpsters banging and smashing in the neighborhood while people are sleeping.

1922
02:43:00,307 --> 02:43:01,147
[SPEAKER_30]: Right, Mrs. Fiorello?

1923
02:43:03,848 --> 02:43:05,989
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other questions from the council at this time?

1924
02:43:06,009 --> 02:43:09,850
[SPEAKER_08]: I just had, I think Councilor Caraviello touched on this.

1925
02:43:09,950 --> 02:43:15,973
[SPEAKER_08]: Does Raising Canyon, or specifically this location, would it contract with like Uber Eats or Grubhub or something that... No.

1926
02:43:16,253 --> 02:43:16,533
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1927
02:43:17,025 --> 02:43:19,827
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, thank you.

1928
02:43:19,847 --> 02:43:21,428
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't do delivery on your own either?

1929
02:43:21,508 --> 02:43:22,789
[SPEAKER_08]: No, okay, thank you.

1930
02:43:25,210 --> 02:43:28,392
[SPEAKER_08]: Do I have any further questions or motion or?

1931
02:43:35,377 --> 02:43:39,320
[SPEAKER_08]: Was that a motion to approve or?

1932
02:43:40,120 --> 02:43:44,103
[SPEAKER_08]: So the public, I did close the public hearing earlier and I continued questions.

1933
02:43:54,110 --> 02:44:03,514
[SPEAKER_08]: So would that be to extend this to, it would be to continue the hearing to the next regular meeting?

1934
02:44:07,496 --> 02:44:15,519
[SPEAKER_04]: We do, but you didn't make a motion to, you don't have a motion, so.

1935
02:44:15,539 --> 02:44:17,980
[SPEAKER_24]: You're not saying approve pending, you're saying you'd like.

1936
02:44:21,314 --> 02:44:26,676
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think we need to notify the petitioner when this would be voted on again.

1937
02:44:31,097 --> 02:44:37,479
[SPEAKER_08]: So you would want to call a special meeting of the city council to vote on this?

1938
02:44:38,239 --> 02:44:39,139
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm asking you, is that...

1939
02:44:45,663 --> 02:44:51,905
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, yeah, I mean, I think so be it July 11 is the next regular meeting we could hold a special meeting.

1940
02:44:51,985 --> 02:44:58,547
[SPEAKER_39]: Does that fall in the parameters of 41 a 65 days right from when we receive it?

1941
02:45:00,808 --> 02:45:03,169
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, yeah.

1942
02:45:04,329 --> 02:45:06,050
[SPEAKER_39]: Yeah, we keep the public hearing.

1943
02:45:08,431 --> 02:45:10,871
[SPEAKER_08]: I close the opposition side.

1944
02:45:11,592 --> 02:45:12,612
[SPEAKER_08]: You can motion to keep it open.

1945
02:45:14,009 --> 02:45:18,792
[SPEAKER_08]: motion to keep it open or reopen or continue it to the next regular meeting?

1946
02:45:20,493 --> 02:45:22,954
[SPEAKER_27]: I think Councilor Bears might have some, he wants to say.

1947
02:45:22,974 --> 02:45:27,597
[SPEAKER_24]: No, I just, I think we're going to, we've had a robust discussion tonight.

1948
02:45:27,617 --> 02:45:30,018
[SPEAKER_24]: I think there's a lot of conditions we're going to add to this.

1949
02:45:30,619 --> 02:45:41,285
[SPEAKER_24]: I think all that's going to happen if we delay till July is that we're going to have to have the conversation again, and we're not going to remember all the details to the level that we have the details now.

1950
02:45:41,826 --> 02:45:53,655
[SPEAKER_24]: So I'm personally comfortable after we had conditions moving forward, approving with conditions pending the six day waiting period, like we have for most of the other special permits we've considered in the past year and a half.

1951
02:45:54,896 --> 02:45:58,759
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Knight, would you withdraw your motion in favor and allow Vice President Bears or?

1952
02:45:58,779 --> 02:46:02,022
[SPEAKER_32]: I didn't make a motion.

1953
02:46:02,102 --> 02:46:08,267
[SPEAKER_32]: All I said was I don't want to wait the six day waiting period and I don't support voting on it until the six day waiting period is over.

1954
02:46:09,517 --> 02:46:10,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Collins.

1955
02:46:10,157 --> 02:46:15,959
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm happy to make that motion motion to approve with CDB recommendations and if there's any other conditions we'd like to apply the permit.

1956
02:46:16,399 --> 02:46:21,601
[SPEAKER_24]: Procedurally, we actually have to have several, we have to have two months to vote on the special permits and we have to go on a site plan review.

1957
02:46:21,641 --> 02:46:22,661
[SPEAKER_24]: So it's- Okay.

1958
02:46:22,681 --> 02:46:25,002
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Caraviello.

1959
02:46:25,382 --> 02:46:28,383
[SPEAKER_10]: If we could put down a 30, 60, 90 day review.

1960
02:46:33,084 --> 02:46:37,846
[SPEAKER_28]: Suppose Madam President, where it's a special permit, the special permit should go with the business and not with the address as well, right?

1961
02:46:42,301 --> 02:46:55,132
[SPEAKER_24]: So what I'm hearing is there's a motion to approve the special permits for drive-through use and the extended hours with the conditions of, did you say 90 day review?

1962
02:46:55,152 --> 02:46:55,132
30, 60, 90.

1963
02:46:55,673 --> 02:46:59,036
[SPEAKER_24]: 30, 60 and 90 day review.

1964
02:46:59,136 --> 02:46:59,957
[SPEAKER_24]: From the date of opening.

1965
02:47:00,637 --> 02:47:01,518
[SPEAKER_24]: From the date of opening.

1966
02:47:01,538 --> 02:47:04,601
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you have an anticipated opening date?

1967
02:47:11,434 --> 02:47:18,180
[SPEAKER_38]: start construction once this is approved and probably December or January, they don't want to push it to next year so I'm thinking late fall.

1968
02:47:18,500 --> 02:47:20,822
[SPEAKER_10]: They're looking to open like January, late fall.

1969
02:47:21,943 --> 02:47:24,324
[SPEAKER_38]: If all goes well, they're going to start construction.

1970
02:47:24,745 --> 02:47:27,827
[SPEAKER_38]: They'd like to get underway and not push construction it may be later than that.

1971
02:47:28,428 --> 02:47:38,476
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm not quite certain what the construction entails for probably six months actually six months to a year.

1972
02:47:40,292 --> 02:47:44,332
[SPEAKER_15]: Council night, but the restriction with the trash pickup.

1973
02:47:45,390 --> 02:47:46,290
[SPEAKER_32]: We already have that?

1974
02:47:46,631 --> 02:47:47,931
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm not in favor of this.

1975
02:47:47,971 --> 02:47:51,333
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm not putting any restrictions on it because I'm voting no.

1976
02:47:52,513 --> 02:47:59,336
[SPEAKER_38]: In terms of the construction time, we still have to come back once constructed for a convictual license.

1977
02:47:59,376 --> 02:48:13,463
[SPEAKER_38]: I think at that point would be appropriate maybe to put the 30, 60 and 90 day review period, because at that point we'd be in a position where it's been gone through and they're ready to open once they're ready for that convictual license.

1978
02:48:15,785 --> 02:48:25,431
[SPEAKER_10]: So Madam President, so that everyone understands, if the council votes no, the restaurant still opens, but they only open till 11 o'clock, correct?

1979
02:48:27,772 --> 02:48:33,835
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's a site plan approval, that's one vote, and then there's a special permit, correct?

1980
02:48:34,836 --> 02:48:39,339
[SPEAKER_24]: Special permits for the drive-throughs and the extended hours of operation.

1981
02:48:39,499 --> 02:48:43,801
[SPEAKER_10]: So the people outside understand, no matter how this council votes,

1982
02:48:46,271 --> 02:48:54,473
[SPEAKER_10]: the restaurant is going to open, they'll just have to modify the hours of operation and things like that.

1983
02:48:56,273 --> 02:49:00,594
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want people to think that a no vote means the restaurant's not coming yet.

1984
02:49:01,235 --> 02:49:04,415
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want people to think that.

1985
02:49:04,655 --> 02:49:08,856
[SPEAKER_24]: It would also mean none of the conditions that have been negotiated and discussed.

1986
02:49:11,697 --> 02:49:15,858
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other conditions from councilors outside of what's already been stated?

1987
02:49:17,051 --> 02:49:20,112
[SPEAKER_24]: Most of the conditions should go on the site plan review, not on the special permits.

1988
02:49:20,512 --> 02:49:21,532
[SPEAKER_24]: I just wanted to clarify.

1989
02:49:23,753 --> 02:49:26,693
[SPEAKER_24]: Because the site plan review is more expansive, it allows for more.

1990
02:49:27,813 --> 02:49:30,314
[SPEAKER_24]: And also that's where the CDB conditions come in.

1991
02:49:34,375 --> 02:49:36,575
[SPEAKER_24]: That's the zoning relief is actually the site plan review.

1992
02:49:36,595 --> 02:49:40,396
[SPEAKER_24]: The special permits are just limited to drive through and the hours of operation.

1993
02:49:41,417 --> 02:49:42,577
[SPEAKER_24]: All the site plan stuff,

1994
02:49:44,332 --> 02:50:03,752
[SPEAKER_24]: conditions of the traffic, the HVAC baffles, which I got from Councilor Scarpelli, no idling during deliveries, basically under the transportation, road mitigation, or the other conditions that we've discussed, sound and noise, would be under site plan review.

1995
02:50:04,233 --> 02:50:06,635
[SPEAKER_24]: But site plan review isn't considered a special permit, right?

1996
02:50:08,362 --> 02:50:11,144
[SPEAKER_29]: Right, so we can't put restrictions on a special permit.

1997
02:50:11,164 --> 02:50:12,365
[SPEAKER_29]: Can you put restrictions on site plan?

1998
02:50:12,385 --> 02:50:13,846
[SPEAKER_11]: You put conditions on site plan?

1999
02:50:13,926 --> 02:50:14,307
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

2000
02:50:20,992 --> 02:50:22,733
[SPEAKER_29]: Did that come from Alicia or did that come from a lawyer?

2001
02:50:23,614 --> 02:50:25,295
[SPEAKER_29]: That came from the Community Development Board.

2002
02:50:30,053 --> 02:50:32,716
[SPEAKER_29]: That's why I asked the question initially, Madam President, right?

2003
02:50:33,116 --> 02:50:33,577
[SPEAKER_32]: You know what I mean?

2004
02:50:33,617 --> 02:50:38,982
[SPEAKER_32]: At the end of the day, we need to make sure we're making decisions that are legally sound and strong footing and foundation.

2005
02:50:39,382 --> 02:50:41,524
[SPEAKER_32]: We don't have that opportunity with this administration.

2006
02:50:41,625 --> 02:50:42,766
[SPEAKER_29]: We haven't had it for three years.

2007
02:50:45,068 --> 02:50:46,109
[SPEAKER_08]: Understood.

2008
02:50:47,030 --> 02:50:54,217
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilors, there's also the ability to continue the public hearing until we can have legal representation.

2009
02:50:55,998 --> 02:51:07,543
[SPEAKER_32]: At this rate, Madam President, this thing will pass with a constructive passage because we'll never take a vote on it the way that this administration is with us when it comes to giving us legal opinions and legal advice and access to legal counsel.

2010
02:51:07,963 --> 02:51:09,904
[SPEAKER_29]: We can't put this on the table pending a legal opinion.

2011
02:51:09,924 --> 02:51:10,584
[SPEAKER_29]: We'll never get one.

2012
02:51:11,667 --> 02:51:16,591
[SPEAKER_24]: I would also add that the petitioner has said verbally that they agreed to all the conditions we've suggested.

2013
02:51:18,332 --> 02:51:26,118
[SPEAKER_08]: And just for clarity, we did the last time we had a special permit, we did keep the public hearing open until we had legal representation, which we did the next meeting.

2014
02:51:26,878 --> 02:51:27,979
[SPEAKER_09]: procedurally and all that.

2015
02:51:28,719 --> 02:51:35,684
[SPEAKER_32]: I mean, and we did it with BJ's too and then we got advice and then that advice ended up getting us taken to court again and then they called and said, what do you want us to do now?

2016
02:51:35,885 --> 02:51:36,325
[SPEAKER_32]: You know what I mean?

2017
02:51:36,345 --> 02:51:42,449
[SPEAKER_32]: It's like, it's just a, it's a comedy of errors in terms of the representation that we received legally here in the community, Madam President.

2018
02:51:42,629 --> 02:51:52,457
[SPEAKER_32]: It puts us at a very significant disadvantage when it comes to making issues, making decisions on issues like this that will have a vast impact on the quality of life of the people that are about us.

2019
02:51:53,197 --> 02:51:54,518
[SPEAKER_32]: All right, so I don't blame Raising Cane's.

2020
02:51:54,598 --> 02:51:57,440
[SPEAKER_32]: I thank Raising Cane's for coming here and wanting to invest in our community.

2021
02:51:57,980 --> 02:52:02,904
[SPEAKER_32]: All right, but the problem that I have is that the administration's not providing us with the tools to make informed and well-sounded decisions.

2022
02:52:03,784 --> 02:52:05,645
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, so at the end of the day, what happens?

2023
02:52:05,665 --> 02:52:06,226
[SPEAKER_32]: Who suffers?

2024
02:52:06,546 --> 02:52:08,747
[SPEAKER_32]: The residents in this community, the taxpayers in this community.

2025
02:52:09,108 --> 02:52:09,788
[SPEAKER_32]: Why do they suffer?

2026
02:52:10,068 --> 02:52:15,092
[SPEAKER_32]: Because we're not able to make determinations that are going to impact things like growth, which is probably the most important thing in this community.

2027
02:52:15,712 --> 02:52:21,117
[SPEAKER_32]: So we get a letter that comes out, we get a newspaper article from the Boston Globe that says, you know, Medford's the fastest growing community.

2028
02:52:21,397 --> 02:52:22,578
[SPEAKER_32]: It can grow fast.

2029
02:52:22,898 --> 02:52:24,539
[SPEAKER_32]: The question is whether or not it's desirable.

2030
02:52:26,361 --> 02:52:27,682
[SPEAKER_32]: Is it a desirable place to live?

2031
02:52:28,583 --> 02:52:30,484
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't see Medford as being desirable right now.

2032
02:52:30,504 --> 02:52:32,726
[SPEAKER_32]: It might be growing fast, but I don't see it as desirable.

2033
02:52:33,126 --> 02:52:43,095
[SPEAKER_32]: And part of the reason that I don't see it as desirable is because the elected officials in this community aren't treated with respect or given the tools that they need to do their job properly and ensure that the taxpayers' rights are protected.

2034
02:52:44,215 --> 02:52:49,378
[SPEAKER_32]: So with that being said, Madam President, when it comes down to this paper that's before us this evening, it's something that I can't support.

2035
02:52:50,238 --> 02:52:53,320
[SPEAKER_32]: You know, we talk about economic development and growth here in this community.

2036
02:52:53,900 --> 02:53:00,303
[SPEAKER_32]: We had the opportunity to bring in a 300 plus million dollar development on Boston Ave, life science and biotech.

2037
02:53:01,184 --> 02:53:03,505
[SPEAKER_32]: It gets blown up by the administration, but we get chicken fingers.

2038
02:53:04,125 --> 02:53:05,026
[SPEAKER_32]: We get chicken fingers, though.

2039
02:53:05,286 --> 02:53:05,806
[SPEAKER_32]: You know what I mean?

2040
02:53:06,026 --> 02:53:07,927
[SPEAKER_32]: So that's the vision that we have in this community right now.

2041
02:53:07,967 --> 02:53:10,268
[SPEAKER_32]: That's the vision that we have when it comes to economic development.

2042
02:53:10,889 --> 02:53:13,190
[SPEAKER_32]: Fast food restaurants, nail salons, Dunkin' Donuts, banks.

2043
02:53:14,568 --> 02:53:16,351
[SPEAKER_32]: All right, we don't create jobs that bring a living wage.

2044
02:53:18,153 --> 02:53:20,537
[SPEAKER_32]: We don't create jobs that provide health insurance for individuals.

2045
02:53:21,177 --> 02:53:30,130
[SPEAKER_32]: When we're looking at this job model here, this position, this entity that's coming before us here, the job that it's gonna create aren't gonna pay people a living wage, not gonna pay them enough money to live in this community.

2046
02:53:31,005 --> 02:53:38,406
[SPEAKER_32]: I have serious and significant concerns about a two-lane highway drive-through where people in flag waver outfits are going to be out there waving people through.

2047
02:53:38,426 --> 02:53:41,427
[SPEAKER_32]: I have serious concerns about an illuminated sign.

2048
02:53:41,907 --> 02:53:50,048
[SPEAKER_32]: I have serious concerns about noise traffic and product drop-off, especially with the extended hours in an area that's abutting a residential neighborhood.

2049
02:53:50,308 --> 02:53:53,909
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, these are the reasons that I'm not going to support the bill.

2050
02:53:54,429 --> 02:53:59,070
[SPEAKER_27]: And I thank you for inviting me and providing me the opportunity to explain my vote.

2051
02:54:00,010 --> 02:54:00,270
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2052
02:54:01,519 --> 02:54:12,448
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have a motion from Councilor Collins, which is to move for approval, including the conditions from the CD board, a 30, 60, 90 day review.

2053
02:54:15,050 --> 02:54:19,774
[SPEAKER_20]: Sorry.

2054
02:54:19,994 --> 02:54:22,416
[SPEAKER_24]: It's the special permit for drive-through and extended hours.

2055
02:54:22,496 --> 02:54:28,761
[SPEAKER_24]: And the conditions are that the permits go with the business, not the license, and that they get 30, 60 and 90 day review from opening.

2056
02:54:29,773 --> 02:54:36,317
[SPEAKER_24]: and then the CD board stuff and the off street loading and all the conditions we've done tonight, that's gonna be on the next vote for the site plan review.

2057
02:54:39,640 --> 02:54:44,243
[SPEAKER_27]: I'd just like the record to reflect Madam President that all these votes this evening are being taken without the advice of legal counsel.

2058
02:54:45,084 --> 02:54:46,304
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

2059
02:54:47,005 --> 02:54:47,745
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam President.

2060
02:54:47,925 --> 02:54:50,107
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Caraviello.

2061
02:54:50,167 --> 02:54:51,368
[SPEAKER_10]: I support the bulk of this.

2062
02:54:51,928 --> 02:54:57,352
[SPEAKER_10]: I just can't support the late night delivery for the product.

2063
02:54:57,832 --> 02:54:58,233
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

2064
02:55:00,380 --> 02:55:06,963
[SPEAKER_10]: We had the same problem with Monogram Foods with the neighbors over there complaining about the trucks with the beeping.

2065
02:55:07,303 --> 02:55:11,724
[SPEAKER_10]: We had the same problem over at BJ's with the same thing with the neighbors with the late night delivery.

2066
02:55:11,744 --> 02:55:17,026
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's really my only issue that's holding me up to vote yes on this.

2067
02:55:17,446 --> 02:55:18,427
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the late night deliveries.

2068
02:55:18,487 --> 02:55:21,948
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have multiple special permits so we can take them separately.

2069
02:55:33,635 --> 02:55:35,316
[SPEAKER_11]: It's from me, make it from me.

2070
02:55:35,336 --> 02:55:35,796
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

2071
02:55:37,256 --> 02:55:40,378
[SPEAKER_11]: All special permits, stay with the business owner.

2072
02:55:41,058 --> 02:55:42,458
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, it already happens anyway.

2073
02:55:42,638 --> 02:55:43,879
[SPEAKER_11]: There's nothing to discuss.

2074
02:55:45,539 --> 02:55:58,304
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so we have the drive-through special permit request.

2075
02:55:59,084 --> 02:56:01,785
[SPEAKER_08]: We have waiving the off-street voting special permit request.

2076
02:56:03,257 --> 02:56:05,378
[SPEAKER_08]: And we have the extended hours special request.

2077
02:56:07,100 --> 02:56:08,000
[SPEAKER_08]: We have the site plan.

2078
02:56:08,020 --> 02:56:10,322
[SPEAKER_10]: And the president we've taken separate votes.

2079
02:56:10,342 --> 02:56:11,583
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are gonna be all one vote.

2080
02:56:12,663 --> 02:56:14,264
[SPEAKER_10]: Should be separate votes.

2081
02:56:23,511 --> 02:56:26,112
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you wanna take this site plan last or first?

2082
02:56:29,014 --> 02:56:32,937
[SPEAKER_08]: The order we got it from the CD board is special part for drive through a special part for extended hours.

2083
02:56:33,717 --> 02:56:36,358
[SPEAKER_08]: waiver of off-street learning requirements, and then site plan review.

2084
02:56:36,378 --> 02:56:40,359
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm happy with that.

2085
02:56:40,799 --> 02:56:44,860
[SPEAKER_08]: Take them over, so.

2086
02:56:47,180 --> 02:56:50,041
[SPEAKER_08]: So I believe Councilor Collins, your motion was to approve the site plan.

2087
02:56:50,061 --> 02:56:54,302
[SPEAKER_08]: So do I have a motion to approve the special plan for drive-through use?

2088
02:57:00,943 --> 02:57:03,024
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, so it should be.

2089
02:57:04,133 --> 02:57:11,197
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion to approve the special permit for drive-thru and the permit go with the business of the license and there'll be 30, 60, 90 day review from opening.

2090
02:57:14,959 --> 02:57:17,220
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that what you'd like to apply the 30, 60, 90 day to?

2091
02:57:17,260 --> 02:57:17,440
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

2092
02:57:17,780 --> 02:57:19,401
[SPEAKER_17]: It should be done all of them really.

2093
02:57:21,642 --> 02:57:31,507
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have motion to approve for drive-thru with the conditions of the special permit go with the building, sorry, with the license and 30, 60, 90 day review.

2094
02:57:34,107 --> 02:57:38,048
[SPEAKER_08]: That motion was from Councilor, President Bears.

2095
02:57:38,188 --> 02:57:38,908
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I lost it.

2096
02:57:39,429 --> 02:57:39,549
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

2097
02:57:39,589 --> 02:57:42,410
[SPEAKER_08]: Seconded by Councilor Collins.

2098
02:57:42,870 --> 02:57:43,970
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2099
02:57:43,990 --> 02:57:47,771
[SPEAKER_08]: And this again is for the drive-through only, the drive-through use.

2100
02:57:52,433 --> 02:57:56,494
[SPEAKER_20]: This is for the drive-through use only with the conditions from the plant, from the,

2101
02:57:57,892 --> 02:58:07,118
[SPEAKER_20]: of the city board plus 30, 60, 90 day review and the permanent stage of the business and not with the exit, right?

2102
02:58:07,538 --> 02:58:10,300
[SPEAKER_24]: Sure, we're gonna just have to vote the city board conditions again.

2103
02:58:10,760 --> 02:58:10,920
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

2104
02:58:13,342 --> 02:58:14,423
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sorry.

2105
02:58:14,443 --> 02:58:15,383
[SPEAKER_24]: Just yeah, it's fine.

2106
02:58:18,805 --> 02:58:19,526
[SPEAKER_20]: Vice President Bears.

2107
02:58:19,806 --> 02:58:20,066
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

2108
02:58:20,927 --> 02:58:21,547
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Caraviello.

2109
02:58:21,567 --> 02:58:21,767
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

2110
02:58:21,807 --> 02:58:23,769
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Collins.

2111
02:58:23,849 --> 02:58:24,109
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

2112
02:58:24,729 --> 02:58:25,170
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Knight.

2113
02:58:25,190 --> 02:58:25,230
[SPEAKER_20]: No.

2114

02:58:45,063 --> 02:58:52,690

2141
03:00:31,891 --> 03:00:33,272
[SPEAKER_08]: If you'd like to keep them separate.

2142
03:00:33,352 --> 03:00:34,513
[SPEAKER_11]: That just happened, right?

2143
03:00:34,533 --> 03:00:35,313

03:00:35,593 --> 03:00:36,194

[SPEAKER_11]: Now we're talking about the separate one for loading.

2150
03:00:45,559 --> 03:00:49,281
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice Mayor Behr's motion to combine it with the site plan review, if you'd like to keep it separate, we can keep it separate.

2151
03:00:49,321 --> 03:00:51,122
[SPEAKER_08]: I like to keep it separate.

2152
03:00:51,142 --> 03:00:51,222
[SPEAKER_35]: Okay.

2153
03:00:51,242 --> 03:00:52,383
[SPEAKER_35]: Okay, it should be one thing.

2154
03:00:53,223 --> 03:00:56,045
[SPEAKER_35]: Technically it needs to be one thing, but that's fine.

2155

[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to waive the off-street loading requirements.

2156
03:01:03,888 --> 03:01:11,915

03:01:11,935 --> 03:01:11,995
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

2158
03:01:13,357 --> 03:01:15,799
[SPEAKER_08]: Of the off-street loading requirements or motion?

2159
03:01:16,640 --> 03:01:19,002
[SPEAKER_07]: Does it have to be one vote?

2160
03:01:19,482 --> 03:01:19,822

[SPEAKER_24]: It's on one paper.

2164
03:01:22,505 --> 03:01:22,945

2168
03:01:37,447 --> 03:01:42,749
[SPEAKER_24]: I have a motion from already voted on half the special permits, so we can't do that.

03:01:43,349 --> 03:01:47,191
[SPEAKER_19]: I motion to do this special permit for the waiver.

2170
03:01:47,211 --> 03:01:48,452
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, that's the next one.

[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, that- It's an automatic.

2178

2188
03:02:33,253 --> 03:02:39,198
[SPEAKER_29]: I just question.

2189
03:02:39,258 --> 03:02:44,002
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just gonna say that, I believe is yeah it would be.

2190
03:02:52,110 --> 03:02:57,534
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, to your point, if the special permit is voted no, then the conditions that were made by the city board.

[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

03:02:59,555 --> 03:03:00,196
[SPEAKER_08]: And yes.

2194
03:03:11,224 --> 03:03:11,784
[SPEAKER_06]: May I clarify?

2195
03:03:12,885 --> 03:03:14,926
[SPEAKER_04]: So the vote was called, right?

2196
03:03:15,627 --> 03:03:16,427
[SPEAKER_08]: Not for the site plan.

2197
03:03:16,628 --> 03:03:16,908
[SPEAKER_08]: No, sir.

2198
03:03:16,968 --> 03:03:18,429
[SPEAKER_08]: May I ask a question?

2199
03:03:20,194 --> 03:03:22,975
[SPEAKER_05]: The next motion will be to approve the site plan review.

2200
03:03:23,015 --> 03:03:26,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Is my understanding correct that the CDB recommendations are attached to the site plan review?

2201
03:03:26,977 --> 03:03:29,498
[SPEAKER_24]: So if we- Yes, I haven't finished making my motion yet.

2202
03:03:29,538 --> 03:03:30,218
[SPEAKER_24]: I was asked to wait.

2203
03:03:30,238 --> 03:03:31,059
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

2204
03:03:31,079 --> 03:03:32,139
[SPEAKER_24]: What's the sufficiency of the vote?

2205
03:03:32,339 --> 03:03:33,220
[SPEAKER_24]: The five or the four?

2206
03:03:33,640 --> 03:03:34,940
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe it's five.

2207
03:03:36,341 --> 03:03:37,041
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe it's five.

2208
03:03:37,061 --> 03:03:45,665
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, my question was if the CD board recommendations are tied to the site plan review and do not apply if the vote gets less than five votes.

2209
03:03:46,385 --> 03:03:47,246
[SPEAKER_09]: That's my understanding, yes.

2210
03:03:47,266 --> 03:03:47,866

2211
03:04:12,391 --> 03:04:14,453

2213
03:04:19,124 --> 03:04:26,627
[SPEAKER_24]: And also I believe I have all the conditions the council put forward, which were to require sealed trash receptacles for customer use.

2214
03:04:29,929 --> 03:04:32,190
[SPEAKER_24]: I can just let me know when I can go to the next one, Mr. Clerk.

2215
03:04:36,592 --> 03:04:40,414
[SPEAKER_24]: Put in baffles for the HVAC system to soundproof the system.

2216
03:04:53,257 --> 03:04:56,378
[SPEAKER_24]: Disallow idling during any deliveries to the facility.

2217
03:05:10,082 --> 03:05:15,363
[SPEAKER_24]: Require quarterly reports to the Medford Health Department from the business's pest control vendor.

2218
03:05:31,619 --> 03:05:36,846
[SPEAKER_24]: And Councilor Caraviello if I'm correct you wanted to route the delivery trucks, you wanted to route the delivery trucks down commercial street.

2219
03:05:40,350 --> 03:05:44,015
[SPEAKER_24]: Explore different routing options for delivery trucks including commercial street.

2220
03:06:01,638 --> 03:06:03,539
[SPEAKER_35]: All good.

2221
03:06:03,719 --> 03:06:06,521
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Clerk, could you please revoke those conditions?

2222
03:06:06,541 --> 03:06:07,001

2223
03:06:17,727 --> 03:06:22,129
[SPEAKER_20]: Motion from Vice President Bears to approve the site plan review with all conditions.

2224
03:06:25,331 --> 03:06:28,153
[SPEAKER_20]: Before conditions are set down by the Committee of Development Board,

2225
03:06:29,729 --> 03:06:43,421
[SPEAKER_20]: requirements, sealed trash receptacles, baffles for the HVAC system, soundproofing system, disallowed idling door during any deliveries to the facility.

2226
03:06:43,461 --> 03:06:53,270
[SPEAKER_20]: Required quarterly reports to the Board of Health from the pest control vendor on road control.

2227
03:07:00,623 --> 03:07:05,827
[SPEAKER_20]: different route operations for deliveries, for delivery trucks, including commercial.

2228
03:07:17,197 --> 03:07:19,078
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other conditions that councilors wanted to add?

2229
03:07:19,098 --> 03:07:24,963
[SPEAKER_08]: I know folks have concerns about delivery hours, but anything folks want to add?

2230
03:07:32,386 --> 03:07:39,472
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so we have a motion from Vice President Bears with those conditions seconded by, motion to approve with those conditions seconded by Councilor Collins.

03:08:10,749 --> 03:08:13,390
[SPEAKER_08]: Pending the six day public comment period.

03:08:14,610 --> 03:08:15,530
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

2250
03:08:17,711 --> 03:08:18,271
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2251
03:08:23,253 --> 03:08:24,373
[SPEAKER_08]: Two, three, dash.

2252
03:08:26,138 --> 03:08:28,680
[SPEAKER_08]: 330 offered by Councilor Knight and Councilor Caraviello.

2253
03:08:29,160 --> 03:08:38,445
[SPEAKER_08]: Whereas part of the FY 23 state budget includes a local option law allowing local retirement systems to increase this year's FY 23 by 2%, which is retroactive to July 1, 2022.

2254
03:08:40,066 --> 03:08:42,647
[SPEAKER_08]: And whereas this new law requires a two-step approval process.

2255
03:08:42,807 --> 03:08:47,790
[SPEAKER_08]: First, the retirement board must vote in favor, and then it must be approved by the local governing body for that board.

2256
03:08:48,830 --> 03:09:01,187
[SPEAKER_08]: be it's a result of Medford City Council request a paper from the mayor enabling the adoption of an additional 2% for Metro retirees prior to June 30 deadline for passage, going to counter night, Madam President, thank you very much.

2257
03:09:01,367 --> 03:09:06,574
[SPEAKER_32]: This was something that was brought to my attention by the many retirees in the city of Medford after an alert was sent out.

2258
03:09:07,114 --> 03:09:16,318
[SPEAKER_32]: by PARAC and the Massachusetts State Retirement Board, saying that the city of Medford hasn't fully funded its cost of living adjustment capabilities for the upcoming fiscal year.

2259
03:09:17,119 --> 03:09:29,445
[SPEAKER_32]: So as we see in this ordinance, I'm sorry, in this resolution, Madam President, the Massachusetts State Legislature, in its divine wisdom, did allow municipalities the local option to increase the cost of living adjustment for retirees to 5%.

2260
03:09:30,485 --> 03:09:33,026
[SPEAKER_32]: It allows us to add an additional 2%.

2261
03:09:33,867 --> 03:09:43,672
[SPEAKER_32]: Now, when we look at the cost of living adjustment that was given to retirees this year, it's actually higher than the 2% standard that the administration has put in place and in effect as the standard cost of living adjustment for active employees.

2262
03:09:44,012 --> 03:09:52,817
[SPEAKER_32]: However, we do have an opportunity, Madam President, for us to take a leap forward and take care of some of the retirees, the people that worked here in this community for a number of years,

2263
03:09:53,177 --> 03:09:54,737
[SPEAKER_32]: that made meant for the great place that it is.

2264
03:09:55,117 --> 03:09:55,437
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay.

2265
03:09:55,838 --> 03:10:03,579
[SPEAKER_32]: So when I look at this paper, what the request is, is to ask the administration to send us the request so that we can approve this document.

2266
03:10:03,739 --> 03:10:08,300
[SPEAKER_32]: There's a two part process for which this needs to be approved.

2267
03:10:08,400 --> 03:10:11,241
[SPEAKER_32]: And the first is the retirement board and the second is the mayor.

2268
03:10:11,721 --> 03:10:21,723
[SPEAKER_32]: So I'm asking that the city administration, retirement board, which falls under the purview of the executive, takes the necessary steps to ensure that our retirees are taken care of.

2269
03:10:22,827 --> 03:10:30,955
[SPEAKER_32]: We hear a lot of people come up to these microphones and talk how much they value the employees and what a great job they do and how much they care about the community and how wonderful all these people were.

2270
03:10:30,975 --> 03:10:31,496
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, show it.

2271
03:10:31,736 --> 03:10:32,837
[SPEAKER_32]: Put your money where your mouth is.

2272
03:10:34,091 --> 03:10:38,653
[SPEAKER_32]: know, I'm sure there'll be another narrative or another reason why this can't happen, Madam President, you know what I mean?

2273
03:10:38,693 --> 03:10:43,315
[SPEAKER_32]: And it's probably going to be rooted in not logic or reality, but what's going to control the spin.

2274
03:10:43,976 --> 03:10:46,217
[SPEAKER_32]: But ultimately, at the end of the day, this is the right thing to do.

2275
03:10:46,697 --> 03:10:48,278
[SPEAKER_32]: All right, these people are on fixed incomes.

2276
03:10:49,018 --> 03:10:50,939
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, many of them live in this community.

2277
03:10:51,759 --> 03:10:53,460
[SPEAKER_32]: They're all elderly, they've reached retirement age.

2278
03:10:53,920 --> 03:11:03,446
[SPEAKER_32]: And if they reach retirement age that means they've put in at least 10 years of employment and service to the general public and the taxpayers of this community and they deserve to be respected, and they deserve to be rewarded.

2279
03:11:03,867 --> 03:11:06,869
[SPEAKER_32]: So with that being said, Madam President asked my council colleagues to support this paper.

2280
03:11:07,912 --> 03:11:09,253
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

2281
03:11:09,293 --> 03:11:18,676
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Madam President, I think Councilor Layton put it eloquently enough, but if I'm not mistaken, I think the retirement board already passed this and it's on the Mayor's desk for approval.

2282
03:11:19,196 --> 03:11:23,838
[SPEAKER_10]: And I've received some calls from people over the last couple of weeks about this.

2283
03:11:24,478 --> 03:11:28,840
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, it's 2%, it's not a lot of money to a lot of these people.

2284
03:11:29,340 --> 03:11:31,321
[SPEAKER_10]: If you ever saw the retirement list,

2285
03:11:32,936 --> 03:11:35,378
[SPEAKER_10]: This is meaning maybe $20, $30 to some people.

2286
03:11:36,799 --> 03:11:40,282
[SPEAKER_10]: The people making larger amounts of money, it's a small bit.

2287
03:11:41,143 --> 03:11:46,428
[SPEAKER_10]: The bulk of the retirees in the city aren't making big money on their retirement plan debt.

2288
03:11:46,708 --> 03:11:47,969
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's a small amount of money.

2289
03:11:49,370 --> 03:11:50,371
[SPEAKER_10]: It should get done.

2290
03:11:50,591 --> 03:11:51,552
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what we're waiting for.

2291
03:11:52,052 --> 03:11:52,733
[SPEAKER_10]: Same reason we are.

2292
03:11:54,790 --> 03:11:59,333
[SPEAKER_10]: We have the money, we're sitting on $25 million that we're just doing nothing with.

2293
03:11:59,874 --> 03:12:00,894
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what the holdup is.

2294
03:12:01,375 --> 03:12:03,416
[SPEAKER_10]: Just get this through it and get it done.

2295
03:12:03,897 --> 03:12:09,240
[SPEAKER_10]: Pay the people who sacrificed for the jobs here for all those years.

2296
03:12:10,301 --> 03:12:10,601
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2297
03:12:11,702 --> 03:12:17,686
[SPEAKER_08]: Further discussion from the council on the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

2298
03:12:17,726 --> 03:12:18,327
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

2299
03:12:18,647 --> 03:12:18,947
[SPEAKER_40]: Aye.

2300
03:12:19,187 --> 03:12:19,948
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

2301
03:12:20,028 --> 03:12:20,709
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion passes.

2302
03:12:20,729 --> 03:12:21,529
[SPEAKER_08]: 2-3-S, 3-3-1.

2303
03:12:23,464 --> 03:12:24,545
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll provide cancer Caraviello.

2304
03:12:25,146 --> 03:12:32,274
[SPEAKER_08]: These are all the city council asked the Election Commission to present a corrective version of the 2023 calendar that has to do with statements and time dealing with Friday, July 21 2023.

2305
03:12:32,554 --> 03:12:42,626
[SPEAKER_08]: Furthermore, to event at voting hours for Saturday as we did in the 2021 municipal election cycle and upon doing such to upload the corrective version to this city on the city website.

2306
03:12:43,903 --> 03:12:44,984
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Madam President.

2307
03:12:45,004 --> 03:12:47,026
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to combine this with Councilor Knights.

2308
03:12:47,766 --> 03:12:49,027
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll just withdraw mine, Ricky.

2309
03:12:49,287 --> 03:12:49,548
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

2310
03:12:50,188 --> 03:12:59,936
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, this council has asked for a Saturday voting during both the primary and municipal election this year.

2311
03:13:01,918 --> 03:13:04,179
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't seen a paper here.

2312
03:13:04,700 --> 03:13:05,460
[SPEAKER_10]: We have something here.

2313
03:13:05,480 --> 03:13:08,183
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope this is the

2314
03:13:11,451 --> 03:13:13,152
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't believe we have something in our packets.

2315
03:13:14,773 --> 03:13:18,135
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought the election director was going to come this evening and present.

2316
03:13:18,515 --> 03:13:23,819
[SPEAKER_08]: I did get an email from her saying they weren't unable to attend tonight when she was going to email a response tomorrow.

2317
03:13:24,379 --> 03:13:28,982
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so motion to table this until she comes to.

2318
03:13:30,837 --> 03:13:31,917
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you want a table?

2319
03:13:31,937 --> 03:13:32,978
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we're putting in a request.

2320
03:13:33,038 --> 03:13:36,639
[SPEAKER_08]: I think she wanted, you can vote for the request and she can respond.

2321
03:13:36,699 --> 03:13:39,760
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's pass the paper and then invite her to come to our next meeting.

2322
03:13:39,860 --> 03:13:43,021
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought we already made the request for the Saturday.

2323
03:13:43,161 --> 03:13:44,161
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm talking about your paper though.

2324
03:13:44,501 --> 03:13:48,042
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you're asking them to make some changes so we can vote to make changes.

2325
03:13:48,082 --> 03:13:56,085
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, there was mistakes on the calendar and when I asked to correct the mistakes and add the Saturday voting.

2326
03:13:56,930 --> 03:14:02,014
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm saying I mean if you want a table of course most of them, I think the most of the way this response.

2327
03:14:02,275 --> 03:14:02,495
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2328
03:14:02,515 --> 03:14:02,695
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

2329
03:14:02,715 --> 03:14:08,219
[SPEAKER_36]: Matthew said do you have an update and that I do thank you, just on the matter of the Saturday voting.

2330
03:14:09,520 --> 03:14:16,286
[SPEAKER_36]: The election, it's my understanding that the Elections Commission has heard the council's request, and has made that change to their election calendar.

2331
03:14:17,567 --> 03:14:22,311
[SPEAKER_36]: As of their most recent meeting which I believe was late last week, or early this week my apologies.

2332
03:14:23,932 --> 03:14:39,165
[SPEAKER_36]: At this point there is a scheduled early voting to the schedule has changed and adjusted to have three weekdays, and one Saturday, which is consistent with the four days that were presented previously, the Saturday that would be included would be if there's a.

2333
03:14:40,146 --> 03:14:41,728
[SPEAKER_36]: preliminary, it would be September 9 2023.

2334
03:14:41,928 --> 03:14:44,452
[SPEAKER_36]: It's a Saturday from 8.

2335
03:14:45,173 --> 03:14:45,894
[SPEAKER_36]: 30am to 2.

2336
03:14:46,254 --> 03:14:46,615
[SPEAKER_36]: 30pm.

2337
03:14:47,696 --> 03:14:52,362
[SPEAKER_36]: If there was obviously for the general election, November 4 is the Saturday from 8.

2338
03:14:53,023 --> 03:14:53,844
[SPEAKER_36]: 30am to 2.

2339
03:14:53,904 --> 03:14:54,164
[SPEAKER_36]: 30pm.

2340
03:14:54,385 --> 03:14:55,386
[SPEAKER_10]: But do we have an actual paper?

2341
03:14:57,578 --> 03:15:07,647
[SPEAKER_36]: Madam President, through you, traditionally, it's my understanding that, you know, the resolution would go through a process to be presented from the city clerk's office to the mayor's office and so on.

2342
03:15:07,907 --> 03:15:11,831
[SPEAKER_10]: And she can come back and present with the correct dates.

2343
03:15:12,171 --> 03:15:13,913
[SPEAKER_10]: Point of information, Madam President.

2344
03:15:14,073 --> 03:15:22,421
[SPEAKER_32]: When the elections manager was up here, they had put this on our agenda, and they had tried to make us vote to support the proposal that they put forward.

2345
03:15:23,143 --> 03:15:25,525
[SPEAKER_32]: But they said that the council doesn't need to support this proposal.

2346
03:15:25,545 --> 03:15:29,429
[SPEAKER_32]: They were just putting us on there to make us aware of it, to put us in a position to support it.

2347
03:15:29,910 --> 03:15:30,711
[SPEAKER_32]: We didn't support it.

2348
03:15:31,171 --> 03:15:33,493
[SPEAKER_32]: We sent it back and we asked them to make those changes, right?

2349
03:15:33,533 --> 03:15:45,625
[SPEAKER_32]: So now we need an official paper from them saying that the Elections Commission has made this policy change, send it back to us and put it on the agenda just like they did previously, unless they're not going to be transparent this time around, because they had to change their mind.

2350
03:15:47,322 --> 03:15:50,905
[SPEAKER_08]: I will make sure I mean, the clerk will make sure we'll make sure that we get that response.

2351
03:15:52,386 --> 03:15:59,612
[SPEAKER_08]: So the motion from Councilor Caraviello to approve seconded by Councilor Knight all those in favor.

2352
03:15:59,632 --> 03:16:03,115
[SPEAKER_08]: I was opposed motion passes 22 dash 332 was withdrawn.

2353
03:16:03,135 --> 03:16:12,783
[SPEAKER_08]: Communications from the mayor 23 dash 320 new honorable President Morell and members of the city council regarding fiscal year 2024 budget submission amended

2354
03:16:13,684 --> 03:16:33,043
[SPEAKER_08]: June 14 2023 dear President Morell and members of the city council, pursuant to MGL chapter 44 section 32 I respect the request and recommend the city council approved the proposed fiscal year 2024 general fund budget as submitted the submitted appropriation for all departments including schools except the water sewer enterprise fund is $179,604,106.

2355
03:16:37,487 --> 03:16:37,807
[SPEAKER_08]: account.

2356
03:16:38,188 --> 03:16:43,451
[SPEAKER_32]: I'd appreciate a waiver of the remaining of the reader I think we need some bottom line there at this point.

2357
03:16:44,592 --> 03:16:51,476
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a motion from Council night to weigh the remainder of the reading of the remainder of the paper second by bears all those in favor.

2358
03:16:53,001 --> 03:16:53,562
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor.

2359
03:16:54,743 --> 03:16:56,425
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed.

2360
03:16:56,445 --> 03:16:59,448
[SPEAKER_32]: Motion passes.

2361
03:16:59,949 --> 03:17:04,414
[SPEAKER_32]: This evening we got, I believe our third and fourth budgets from the administration.

2362
03:17:05,195 --> 03:17:08,739
[SPEAKER_32]: We didn't get the I didn't see the press release that went out about how the administration's put out

2363
03:17:09,059 --> 03:17:10,480
[SPEAKER_32]: three more budgets since the initial one.

2364
03:17:11,301 --> 03:17:23,573
[SPEAKER_32]: But, you know, today at two o'clock, and again at six o'clock we got two additional budgets, right with updates or amendments or reallocations, and I'm wondering if the paper that before us this evening reflects those changes that have been made by the administration.

2365
03:17:36,889 --> 03:17:39,350
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you President morale through you to Councilor Knight.

2366
03:17:39,850 --> 03:17:48,774
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes, this budget does present the budget, as you know, ultimately is in totality the budget that's final presented to the city council.

2367
03:17:50,454 --> 03:18:01,599
[SPEAKER_36]: Earlier versions as you referenced Councilor Knight included some one version included some changes to some typographical issues but the most recent version for this specific paper that came before the version.

2368
03:18:02,859 --> 03:18:18,008
[SPEAKER_36]: essentially but well this version is actually the version that adjust the budget, as requested by the city council and in particular to just the school department budget upward and adjust the library budget upward, it provides the city council with the zoning request.

2369
03:18:18,508 --> 03:18:26,773
[SPEAKER_36]: I want to thank the city council members who have participated in this process, I know the mayor has personally reached out to each and every one of you.

2370
03:18:26,793 --> 03:18:30,575
[SPEAKER_36]: I know that there's been some engagement and back and forth between some of you on this

2371
03:18:32,409 --> 03:18:35,372
[SPEAKER_26]: Did the mayor meet with any of the councils personally in our office to discuss this budget?

2372
03:18:37,274 --> 03:18:37,974
[SPEAKER_26]: Or on the telephone?

2373
03:18:38,575 --> 03:18:39,496
[SPEAKER_26]: Or you for that matter?

2374
03:18:40,677 --> 03:18:42,338
[SPEAKER_36]: I'm sorry, could you clarify the question?

2375
03:18:42,679 --> 03:18:48,204
[SPEAKER_32]: Did you meet with any member of this elected body individually to discuss the budget?

2376
03:18:51,294 --> 03:18:52,475
[SPEAKER_36]: to discuss the budget.

2377
03:18:52,495 --> 03:18:54,696
[SPEAKER_28]: It's not a trick question.

2378
03:18:55,736 --> 03:18:57,217
[SPEAKER_36]: No, it's not a trick question.

2379
03:18:57,237 --> 03:19:04,501
[SPEAKER_36]: I'm expressing that through you, President Morell, I'm expressing that the mayor had conversations with members of this group.

2380
03:19:05,101 --> 03:19:08,763
[SPEAKER_36]: I'm expressing my thanks for that through her on that matter.

2381
03:19:08,803 --> 03:19:17,667
[SPEAKER_36]: And I'm expressing that through those conversations, there were either conversations, meetings, a variety of different communications occurred based on the various members.

2382
03:19:17,727 --> 03:19:20,949
[SPEAKER_36]: Some members were through text messages, some members were through other means.

2383
03:19:21,550 --> 03:19:23,811
[SPEAKER_27]: So these conversations were outside the scope of the public forum.

2384
03:19:25,712 --> 03:19:31,494
[SPEAKER_36]: Which is through you, President Morell, which is not an unusual or uncommon thing to complete.

2385
03:19:31,514 --> 03:19:31,734
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes.

2386
03:19:33,374 --> 03:19:34,515
[SPEAKER_06]: Please continue.

2387
03:19:35,295 --> 03:19:35,615
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.

2388
03:19:35,715 --> 03:19:47,280
[SPEAKER_36]: So as is presented before the city council, I know that there were comments of one of the most recent meetings that, you know, this budget would not be voted by members of the council unless the zoning matter was presented here.

2389
03:19:47,340 --> 03:19:48,760
[SPEAKER_36]: The zoning matter is presented here.

2390
03:19:48,780 --> 03:19:49,721
[SPEAKER_36]: It's fully funded, that 51,000.

2391
03:19:51,041 --> 03:19:52,762
[SPEAKER_36]: I know there were questions and concerns about that.

2392
03:19:53,162 --> 03:19:58,986
[SPEAKER_36]: I know the other two priorities of the council that were very high issues were the library and the school budgets.

2393
03:20:00,126 --> 03:20:13,614
[SPEAKER_36]: As you know, the, the library budget has been fully funded and as of information we received today, and which we've communicated to the city council, the school department budget is also of course been bridged to ensure that they have the resources that they need.

2394
03:20:14,214 --> 03:20:19,077
[SPEAKER_36]: So I'm happy to answer any specific questions, obviously, finance director Dickinson is here as well.

2395
03:20:19,697 --> 03:20:26,785
[SPEAKER_36]: and to the degree there are additional questions that exist, I'm happy to find the resources to do my best to answer the questions this evening.

2396
03:20:27,106 --> 03:20:27,466
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2397
03:20:27,486 --> 03:20:29,348
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

2398
03:20:29,508 --> 03:20:30,790
[SPEAKER_32]: It's on that point of information.

2399
03:20:31,731 --> 03:20:33,713
[SPEAKER_32]: So I'm looking at this paper and it says that this was

2400
03:20:34,537 --> 03:20:36,037
[SPEAKER_32]: the mayor's fiscal year budget amended on 6 14 23.

2401
03:20:36,318 --> 03:20:36,698
[SPEAKER_32]: Today 6 2023.

2402
03:20:36,798 --> 03:20:41,479
[SPEAKER_32]: We've gotten two emails from you wanted six o'clock.

2403
03:20:41,519 --> 03:20:44,480
[SPEAKER_32]: I wanted two o'clock today that further amends the budget.

2404
03:20:44,500 --> 03:20:50,002
[SPEAKER_32]: So what you're telling me now is that the paper that's before us that was amended on 6 15 reflects those amendments that you sent us on 6 20.

2405
03:20:52,182 --> 03:20:56,324
[SPEAKER_36]: Madam President, through you know, uh, allow me to clarify, please, Councilor Knight.

2406
03:20:56,904 --> 03:20:59,985
[SPEAKER_36]: Um and I just want to make sure I have the most recent version in front of me.

2407
03:21:00,025 --> 03:21:03,746
[SPEAKER_36]: So I'm referring to your version of

2408
03:21:06,272 --> 03:21:07,173
[SPEAKER_36]: the specific matter.

2409
03:21:07,654 --> 03:21:19,788
[SPEAKER_36]: To be clear, I believe we're discussing the general fund budget, is that your understanding I have, according to the city council agenda for purposes of clarity, resolution number 23 dash 320 Is that correct?

2410
03:21:20,268 --> 03:21:20,449
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

2411
03:21:21,410 --> 03:21:21,730
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.

2412
03:21:21,750 --> 03:21:25,675
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we're just trying to understand did this bottom line number change based on anything

2413
03:21:26,522 --> 03:21:27,022
[SPEAKER_36]: It has not.

2414
03:21:27,382 --> 03:21:32,305
[SPEAKER_36]: The version that is in your packet is the most up-to-date version for this specific item.

2415
03:21:32,865 --> 03:21:41,390
[SPEAKER_36]: There is another resolution, which we will discuss it later in the evening, I believe, which has made a bottom line change, but I don't want to confuse this issue.

2416
03:21:41,490 --> 03:21:42,530
[SPEAKER_36]: This is for 2330, 320.

2417
03:21:42,630 --> 03:21:47,113
[SPEAKER_36]: This is the version that is presented for the council to vote.

2418
03:21:51,212 --> 03:21:52,953
[SPEAKER_08]: I would just add for the other.

2419
03:21:53,173 --> 03:21:53,874
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes, water sewer.

2420
03:21:53,914 --> 03:21:54,154
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.

2421
03:21:54,174 --> 03:22:04,160
[SPEAKER_36]: I will just add that, you know, in my experience, these types of things in front of the legislative body do at times have modifications and corrections that come before the body itself.

2422
03:22:04,281 --> 03:22:07,302
[SPEAKER_36]: In this case, this body obviously is the legislative body.

2423
03:22:07,763 --> 03:22:16,168
[SPEAKER_36]: You know, I have worked in other communities where there's a town meeting body and these types of things are not unusual, where there are adjustments, corrections, etc.

2424
03:22:16,428 --> 03:22:17,749
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you for your patience.

2425
03:22:19,565 --> 03:22:36,157
[SPEAKER_32]: I did I was just gonna say on that point in these other communities normally when financial data is requested from the legislative body they receive it they're not told that they can't get it even though the ordinance says it should be providing it that the book should be provided to the Council upon request, you know, so you know when we talk about what they do other places.

2426
03:22:36,797 --> 03:22:37,818
[SPEAKER_29]: Let's talk about the good.

2427
03:22:38,478 --> 03:22:42,001
[SPEAKER_29]: But let's talk about the bad that we do here too because what other places do we don't do.

2428
03:22:45,046 --> 03:22:58,393
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Madam President, through extensive discussions between the mayor and council leadership, I believe we were able to reach an agreement that makes progress on our goal for a better budget process and enables us to move forward and create a plan to fix the city's biggest challenges.

2429
03:22:59,214 --> 03:23:06,578
[SPEAKER_24]: Thanks to that agreement, I'm able to move ahead and support the fiscal 24 budget as amended to include increases to the schools library and zoning reform.

2430
03:23:07,338 --> 03:23:22,922
[SPEAKER_24]: We received commitments to create a financial task force with city council members, school committee members and city staff to make a plan to fund the city's major challenges to establish a better budget process based on clear principles of having budget meetings starting in January and February.

2431
03:23:23,482 --> 03:23:36,386
[SPEAKER_24]: A process for the council to submit recommendations to the mayor and receive responses from the mayor prior to the budget being submitted by the mayor, as well as to conduct comprehensive assessments of our operating and capital budget needs.

2432
03:23:37,520 --> 03:23:45,566
[SPEAKER_24]: We also agreed to explore the use of one time funds for budget planning for assessing our staffing needs and our capital needs.

2433
03:23:46,822 --> 03:23:52,404
[SPEAKER_24]: And we also agreed to continue discussions to advance the charter amendments approved by this council in some form.

2434
03:23:53,164 --> 03:24:04,008
[SPEAKER_24]: I think this agreement leaves much work to do, and I plan to work in good faith to implement it, because I truly believe that if we can get this done, we can build a better future that everyone in our city deserves.

2435
03:24:04,808 --> 03:24:06,049
[SPEAKER_24]: That's all I'm going to say.

2436
03:24:06,649 --> 03:24:07,189
[SPEAKER_24]: So thank you.

2437
03:24:09,321 --> 03:24:11,943
[SPEAKER_16]: It's point of information question would be to my fellow councils.

2438
03:24:12,403 --> 03:24:21,209
[SPEAKER_16]: At the beginning of that you said the leadership, how and when was this leadership taken, and we're all of this council privy to that discussion.

2439
03:24:22,930 --> 03:24:25,332
[SPEAKER_24]: When I said Council leadership I meant the President and Vice President.

2440
03:24:25,672 --> 03:24:29,095
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so the President and the Vice President met with

2441
03:24:30,114 --> 03:24:41,700
[SPEAKER_16]: you saying you had you met with the mayor and you had the agenda that you and the president had to present to the mayor without the input of fellow councils, five other fellow councils.

2442
03:24:41,720 --> 03:24:42,921
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that true?

2443
03:24:46,342 --> 03:24:49,864
[SPEAKER_24]: We worked with what this council had passed and tried to reach an agreement to get it done.

2444
03:24:49,904 --> 03:24:52,005
[SPEAKER_16]: No, no, no.

2445
03:24:52,145 --> 03:24:58,709
[SPEAKER_16]: Did this leadership team meet with this council person and say, we're going to the mayor as our leadership team.

2446
03:24:59,793 --> 03:25:09,899
[SPEAKER_16]: Did our leadership team come to this councilor that represents the people of the city and say, we have a plan that we want to present to the mayor as a councilor, do you agree?

2447
03:25:09,919 --> 03:25:11,180
[SPEAKER_16]: Did you give me that opportunity?

2448
03:25:12,781 --> 03:25:12,981
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

2449
03:25:13,361 --> 03:25:13,621
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

2450
03:25:14,302 --> 03:25:18,064
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think that this agreement you have is fraudulent.

2451
03:25:18,764 --> 03:25:27,650
[SPEAKER_16]: It doesn't, it does not encompass what this, you can't put, you can't say, Madam President, that the leadership of this council

2452
03:25:28,775 --> 03:25:36,081
[SPEAKER_16]: eliminating some Councilors in that decision and say that this isn't a fraudulent decision that you've made?

2453
03:25:36,241 --> 03:25:36,821
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely not.

2454
03:25:37,121 --> 03:25:37,762
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely not.

2455
03:25:37,842 --> 03:25:38,563
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2456
03:25:39,043 --> 03:25:43,066
[SPEAKER_16]: If it smells, if it walks like a duck, and it looks like a duck, it's a duck.

2457
03:25:43,106 --> 03:25:47,349
[SPEAKER_08]: You can disagree, you can disagree, but to call it fraudulent and to call into question.

2458
03:25:47,689 --> 03:25:49,651
[SPEAKER_16]: I call into question for what you just said.

2459
03:25:50,271 --> 03:25:50,992
[SPEAKER_16]: Absolutely.

2460
03:25:51,352 --> 03:25:57,077
[SPEAKER_16]: Point of information, the Councilor came into this chamber, looked at me and said to me and my fellow Councilor and said,

2461
03:25:59,042 --> 03:26:02,865
[SPEAKER_16]: We talk with the mayor and we have an agreement.

2462
03:26:03,246 --> 03:26:04,127
[SPEAKER_16]: Who is weak?

2463
03:26:04,587 --> 03:26:05,488
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I'm not weak.

2464
03:26:07,395 --> 03:26:07,875
[SPEAKER_24]: I just said it.

2465
03:26:08,215 --> 03:26:09,216
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I'm not weak.

2466
03:26:09,776 --> 03:26:16,020
[SPEAKER_16]: And this council to say that my leadership with YouTube, and you represent me one Councilor, I don't care about anybody else right now.

2467
03:26:16,540 --> 03:26:26,145
[SPEAKER_16]: You represent this council, you never you to never talk told me about this presentation, you were going to give the mayor and what what negotiations you were going to have with the mayor.

2468
03:26:27,266 --> 03:26:36,671
[SPEAKER_16]: So you're telling me the mayor met with YouTube, and you had an agreement that you think that you were going to work out to give her the votes that she needs to pass this budget.

2469
03:26:39,025 --> 03:26:41,547
[SPEAKER_24]: We had a discussion with the mayor and we created an agreement.

2470
03:26:41,567 --> 03:26:43,989
[SPEAKER_24]: So personally, you had a discussion with the mayor and you had an agreement?

2471
03:26:44,189 --> 03:26:44,409
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

2472
03:26:44,910 --> 03:26:53,156
[SPEAKER_24]: And it was based on the seven budget meetings we had, what everybody's asked for, and that we thought that we would get the best of possible of what everybody has said they want.

2473
03:26:53,317 --> 03:26:54,718
[SPEAKER_16]: So on the record.

2474
03:26:54,738 --> 03:26:57,480
[SPEAKER_16]: And because of open meeting, we're not allowed to have a conversation.

2475
03:26:57,600 --> 03:26:59,381
[SPEAKER_16]: Excuse me, excuse me.

2476
03:26:59,602 --> 03:27:01,163
[SPEAKER_16]: He has the floor originally.

2477
03:27:05,106 --> 03:27:16,742
[SPEAKER_24]: Because of the open meeting law, we are unable to talk to all of you at once, it's against the law, right, so you elected us as your council leadership, if you would like to elect a different leadership that's up to you, Matt point of information Madam President.

2478
03:27:17,864 --> 03:27:21,589
[SPEAKER_16]: So, did the leadership talk to counter Caraviello.

2479
03:27:22,270 --> 03:27:25,692
[SPEAKER_16]: This is a question I have, did the leadership talk to Councilor Knight?

2480
03:27:25,992 --> 03:27:28,994
[SPEAKER_16]: Did the leadership talk to Councilor Collins?

2481
03:27:29,094 --> 03:27:31,355
[SPEAKER_16]: Did the leadership talk to Councilor Tseng?

2482
03:27:31,675 --> 03:27:33,637
[SPEAKER_16]: And did the leadership talk to Councilor Scarpelli?

2483
03:27:34,017 --> 03:27:35,578
[SPEAKER_16]: Did the leadership do those things?

2484
03:27:35,658 --> 03:27:36,818
[SPEAKER_16]: Because if you did,

2485
03:27:37,879 --> 03:27:43,040
[SPEAKER_16]: and without consulting maybe two or three or four and not all seven, then I'm going to have a problem with that.

2486
03:27:43,280 --> 03:27:45,441
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm going to make sure that we look into this.

2487
03:27:45,881 --> 03:27:59,905
[SPEAKER_16]: Because if you did that, if you individually talk to each Councilor and presented a plan that went to the mayor to negotiate something without all of us together, I find it to be a problem.

2488
03:28:00,245 --> 03:28:01,285
[SPEAKER_08]: I assure you I did not.

2489
03:28:01,745 --> 03:28:03,246
[SPEAKER_08]: And I can say that with clear conscience.

2490
03:28:05,316 --> 03:28:05,876
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Villes?

2491
03:28:06,916 --> 03:28:07,697
[SPEAKER_16]: You said leadership.

2492
03:28:07,717 --> 03:28:09,237
[SPEAKER_16]: What are you asking about?

2493
03:28:09,317 --> 03:28:10,397
[SPEAKER_16]: I just asked you the question.

2494
03:28:10,697 --> 03:28:13,658
[SPEAKER_16]: Did you talk to Councilor- Did I violate the open meeting law?

2495
03:28:13,698 --> 03:28:15,699
[SPEAKER_16]: No, no, did you meet, I never said that.

2496
03:28:15,919 --> 03:28:16,899
[SPEAKER_16]: I said, I didn't say that.

2497
03:28:17,059 --> 03:28:22,401
[SPEAKER_16]: I said, I said, did you individually, I didn't say violate an open meeting law.

2498
03:28:22,741 --> 03:28:28,042
[SPEAKER_16]: Did you individually meet with other councilors to present a plan that you were gonna bring to the mayor?

2499
03:28:29,203 --> 03:28:31,883
[SPEAKER_16]: Be careful now, because there are ways to find things out now.

2500
03:28:32,864 --> 03:28:33,744
[SPEAKER_16]: That's the question I have.

2501
03:28:35,253 --> 03:28:35,934
[SPEAKER_24]: Say it again, please.

2502
03:28:36,594 --> 03:28:43,200
[SPEAKER_16]: Did you meet with other members of this council one on one didn't not saying you violate any open meeting law.

2503
03:28:43,560 --> 03:28:48,384
[SPEAKER_16]: Did you meet with other Councilors and present the plan that then went to the mayor.

2504
03:28:48,804 --> 03:28:50,166
[SPEAKER_24]: I spoke to Councilor Tseng about a plan.

2505
03:28:50,366 --> 03:28:50,646
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

2506
03:28:50,866 --> 03:28:51,767
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

2507
03:28:51,907 --> 03:28:53,829
[SPEAKER_16]: Did you talk to Councilman Caraviello?

2508
03:28:54,129 --> 03:28:54,289
[SPEAKER_24]: No.

2509
03:28:54,629 --> 03:28:56,071
[SPEAKER_16]: Did you count Scott's concept?

2510
03:28:56,091 --> 03:29:03,397
[SPEAKER_24]: Because once I talked about it, once President Morell talks about it, and once I talked about Councilor Tseng that's three, if I talked to anyone else, that's four and it's violating the open meeting law.

2511
03:29:03,797 --> 03:29:04,598
[SPEAKER_25]: So why do we have a meeting?

2512
03:29:04,698 --> 03:29:05,358
[SPEAKER_24]: It's a violation.

2513
03:29:05,398 --> 03:29:06,960
[SPEAKER_24]: Why do you have a meeting then, Zach?

2514
03:29:07,100 --> 03:29:08,521
[SPEAKER_16]: Because why do you have a meeting with us?

2515
03:29:08,721 --> 03:29:10,123
[SPEAKER_16]: Why did you put this up in a meeting?

2516
03:29:10,163 --> 03:29:13,145
[SPEAKER_16]: These discussions occurred between other meetings.

2517
03:29:13,445 --> 03:29:15,887
[SPEAKER_16]: Madam President, it doesn't look good.

2518
03:29:16,248 --> 03:29:21,512
[SPEAKER_16]: It doesn't make it that this council, all due respect, this council's worked hard to work together.

2519
03:29:21,933 --> 03:29:28,718
[SPEAKER_16]: And this council has been standing side by side with all of these negative initiatives that we will follow through, we'll continue with.

2520
03:29:29,139 --> 03:29:30,860
[SPEAKER_16]: Because there's a lot that's gonna be said tonight.

2521
03:29:31,821 --> 03:29:45,231
[SPEAKER_16]: to go through that and then make a decision after talking to only three Councilors or two Councilors and then going to the mayor personally and negotiating something for what's best, the leadership for what's best for us in this city?

2522
03:29:45,331 --> 03:29:45,951
[SPEAKER_16]: You didn't do that.

2523
03:29:47,032 --> 03:29:47,932
[SPEAKER_16]: Nobody consulted me.

2524
03:29:47,952 --> 03:29:54,417
[SPEAKER_16]: From what I gather, nobody consulted Councilor Caraviello or Councilor Knight or Councilor Collins, as you said.

2525
03:29:55,458 --> 03:29:57,299
[SPEAKER_16]: So I find that a real problem.

2526
03:29:58,019 --> 03:29:58,360
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2527
03:29:59,704 --> 03:29:59,924
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry.

2528
03:29:59,944 --> 03:30:00,124
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

2529
03:30:00,144 --> 03:30:00,364
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

2530
03:30:00,404 --> 03:30:00,644
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

2531
03:30:00,664 --> 03:30:01,564
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

03:30:01,745 --> 03:30:02,045

[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

2539
03:30:04,825 --> 03:30:05,105
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

2540
03:30:05,125 --> 03:30:05,365
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

2541
03:30:05,385 --> 03:30:05,666
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

2542
03:30:05,686 --> 03:30:05,946
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

2543
03:30:05,966 --> 03:30:06,206
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

2544
03:30:06,286 --> 03:30:06,606
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

2545
03:30:06,706 --> 03:30:07,386
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

2546
03:30:07,406 --> 03:30:07,706
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

2547
03:30:07,826 --> 03:30:08,746
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

2548
03:30:08,766 --> 03:30:08,966
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

2549
03:30:08,986 --> 03:30:09,226
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

2550
03:30:09,326 --> 03:30:09,647
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

2551
03:30:09,687 --> 03:30:10,227
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

2552
03:30:10,267 --> 03:30:10,567
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

2553
03:30:10,587 --> 03:30:10,887
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

2554
03:30:10,947 --> 03:30:11,167
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

2555
03:30:11,187 --> 03:30:11,387
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

2556
03:30:11,407 --> 03:30:11,707
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

2557
03:30:12,187 --> 03:30:14,108
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

2558
03:30:14,128 --> 03:30:14,328
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

2559
03:30:14,368 --> 03:30:14,608
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

2560
03:30:14,628 --> 03:30:14,908
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

2561
03:30:14,928 --> 03:30:15,228
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

2562
03:30:15,848 --> 03:30:16,108
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

2563
03:30:16,328 --> 03:30:16,588
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

2564
03:30:17,268 --> 03:30:17,548
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

2565
03:30:17,568 --> 03:30:18,009
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

2566
03:30:18,029 --> 03:30:18,909
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

2567
03:30:18,949 --> 03:30:19,249
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

2568
03:30:19,289 --> 03:30:19,489
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

2569
03:30:19,869 --> 03:30:20,209
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

2570
03:30:20,229 --> 03:30:20,589
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

2571
03:30:21,209 --> 03:30:21,409
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

2572
03:30:21,449 --> 03:30:21,710
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

2573
03:30:21,730 --> 03:30:21,930
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

2574
03:30:21,970 --> 03:30:22,190
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

2575
03:30:22,230 --> 03:30:22,450
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

2576
03:30:22,470 --> 03:30:22,830
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

2577
03:30:22,890 --> 03:30:23,150
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

2578
03:30:23,190 --> 03:30:23,550
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

2579
03:30:23,570 --> 03:30:23,830
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

2580
03:30:23,850 --> 03:30:24,050
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

2581
03:30:24,070 --> 03:30:24,350
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

2582
03:30:24,370 --> 03:30:25,290
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

2583
03:30:28,285 --> 03:30:31,327
[SPEAKER_16]: Then I moved to table this meeting for another next meeting.

2584
03:30:32,908 --> 03:30:33,688
[SPEAKER_16]: So we can talk.

2585
03:30:33,989 --> 03:30:34,749
[SPEAKER_32]: Just a quick question.

2586
03:30:34,809 --> 03:30:37,351
[SPEAKER_32]: When did the mayor determine that it was time to have a discussion?

2587
03:30:38,131 --> 03:30:40,893
[SPEAKER_08]: I reached out to the mayor.

2588
03:30:41,473 --> 03:30:42,374
[SPEAKER_08]: I reached out to the mayor.

2589
03:30:43,614 --> 03:30:44,015
[SPEAKER_08]: I decided.

2590
03:30:44,095 --> 03:30:45,296
[SPEAKER_32]: Absent a vote of the council?

2591
03:30:46,897 --> 03:30:48,297
[SPEAKER_08]: I spoke to her as a Councilor.

2592
03:30:50,179 --> 03:30:52,460
[SPEAKER_32]: Not as the leadership team, as council of business noted earlier.

2593
03:30:52,940 --> 03:30:53,921
[SPEAKER_08]: She said that as short.

2594
03:30:54,041 --> 03:30:55,402
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I spoke to her as a Councilor.

2595
03:30:55,942 --> 03:30:56,763
[SPEAKER_08]: He said that as shorthand.

2596
03:30:57,554 --> 03:30:59,935
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I mean, you want to trip me up trip me up on it.

2597
03:31:00,015 --> 03:31:05,077
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm not trying to trip you up I'm just saying as the elected president I had the same issue with john Falco, and I got my ass kicked for it.

2598
03:31:05,897 --> 03:31:07,898
[SPEAKER_32]: But I called him out on it, and I got a beating on it.

2599
03:31:07,918 --> 03:31:12,939
[SPEAKER_32]: You know what I mean, because I like the president to represent the interest of the body not the interest of yourself.

2600
03:31:13,379 --> 03:31:15,500
[SPEAKER_32]: So when you get elected president of the council.

2601
03:31:16,000 --> 03:31:16,240
[SPEAKER_32]: Right.

2602
03:31:18,101 --> 03:31:19,222
[SPEAKER_32]: different responsibility.

2603
03:31:19,502 --> 03:31:21,623
[SPEAKER_32]: You have responsibility to the people buying this realtor.

2604
03:31:22,064 --> 03:31:23,044
[SPEAKER_32]: Now you did what you did.

2605
03:31:23,204 --> 03:31:23,825
[SPEAKER_32]: It is what it is.

2606
03:31:24,105 --> 03:31:24,445
[SPEAKER_32]: All right.

2607
03:31:24,605 --> 03:31:28,087
[SPEAKER_32]: And I know that you haven't been in the chair a long time, so I get it.

2608
03:31:28,547 --> 03:31:28,928
[SPEAKER_25]: I get it.

2609
03:31:29,128 --> 03:31:29,448
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

2610
03:31:29,728 --> 03:31:31,669
[SPEAKER_25]: But ultimately, right, we're a body.

2611
03:31:32,310 --> 03:31:32,990
[SPEAKER_25]: We're a body.

2612
03:31:34,351 --> 03:31:34,971
[SPEAKER_25]: We're a body.

2613
03:31:35,111 --> 03:31:35,292
[SPEAKER_25]: Now,

2614
03:31:36,345 --> 03:31:43,030
[SPEAKER_08]: When I look at this- I mean, if you're pointing for me, Councilor Caraviello, do you want, you have your next on the floor.

2615
03:31:43,631 --> 03:31:44,712
[SPEAKER_32]: We're a body, right?

2616
03:31:44,732 --> 03:31:59,103
[SPEAKER_32]: So right now what I'm seeing happened is we have a budget that's before us that wasn't the budget that we got when the press releases went out saying this is the first time you ever got a budget, because it was a fake budget, because the school department never passed their aspect of it before it comes to us, which is the normal practice.

2617
03:31:59,584 --> 03:32:05,889
[SPEAKER_32]: All right, now we have an administration horse trading, horse trading outside the public sphere.

2618
03:32:07,315 --> 03:32:09,176
[SPEAKER_31]: to ensure passage of a budget.

2619
03:32:09,616 --> 03:32:12,097
[SPEAKER_31]: The same administration that runs on transparency.

2620
03:32:13,598 --> 03:32:14,898
[SPEAKER_31]: That's not transparent.

2621
03:32:15,579 --> 03:32:16,819
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't care what anybody says.

2622
03:32:17,239 --> 03:32:19,480
[SPEAKER_32]: It's a classic divide and conquer strategy.

2623
03:32:20,281 --> 03:32:22,782
[SPEAKER_32]: A classic divide and conquer strategy.

2624
03:32:23,262 --> 03:32:26,903
[SPEAKER_32]: So the mayor for three years can fail to respond to the body public.

2625
03:32:27,724 --> 03:32:29,364
[SPEAKER_31]: Fail to respond to the body public.

2626
03:32:30,105 --> 03:32:32,546
[SPEAKER_31]: Then there's closed door deals with select Councilors.

2627
03:32:34,397 --> 03:32:37,839
[SPEAKER_31]: And other Councilors that are elected by the people of this community are excluded?

2628
03:32:43,282 --> 03:32:45,103
[SPEAKER_31]: You guys think you know about the open meeting law?

2629
03:32:45,283 --> 03:32:49,786
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm gonna tell you right now, I think you're teetering very close, very close to a violation.

2630
03:32:50,326 --> 03:32:53,948
[SPEAKER_31]: Just because you weren't in the same room at the same time doesn't mean there wasn't deliberation.

2631
03:32:57,370 --> 03:33:01,633
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm not making that accusation, but what I'm saying is, perception is reality.

2632
03:33:03,066 --> 03:33:09,489
[SPEAKER_31]: So the perception that I get right now is that the mayor picked up the phone, called a few people into her office, and cut a deal, left the rest of us hanging on the shelf.

2633
03:33:10,089 --> 03:33:19,513
[SPEAKER_31]: So we sat here, and we made votes, and we made speeches, and we made pledges, and we made commitments to the people in this community, to the people in this community.

2634
03:33:20,822 --> 03:33:24,464
[SPEAKER_31]: And sometimes making hard decisions isn't politically expedient.

2635
03:33:24,905 --> 03:33:27,686
[SPEAKER_31]: Sometimes making hard decisions isn't politically popular.

2636
03:33:28,227 --> 03:33:31,168
[SPEAKER_31]: But people didn't elect us to take the easy road.

2637
03:33:31,829 --> 03:33:33,690
[SPEAKER_31]: People didn't elect us to take the easy way out.

2638
03:33:35,031 --> 03:33:39,494
[SPEAKER_31]: So we've sat here and we beat our chests about, oh, we're gonna protect everybody.

2639
03:33:39,514 --> 03:33:40,874
[SPEAKER_31]: We're gonna get this, we're gonna get that.

2640
03:33:41,074 --> 03:33:42,015
[SPEAKER_31]: We've gotten nothing.

2641
03:33:42,415 --> 03:33:48,079
[SPEAKER_31]: This administration's accomplished nothing other than recycling and regurgitating old plans from previous administrations.

2642
03:33:49,394 --> 03:33:53,357
[SPEAKER_31]: And we're sitting here passing it like a rubber stamp, pot and parcel.

2643
03:33:54,959 --> 03:33:59,022
[SPEAKER_31]: Because it's not about Medford, it's not about the community, it's about what we can get on the way through the door.

2644
03:34:05,368 --> 03:34:06,128
[SPEAKER_31]: It's a disgrace.

2645
03:34:07,049 --> 03:34:08,611
[SPEAKER_32]: It's a disgrace and I'm disgusted.

2646
03:34:09,171 --> 03:34:12,074
[SPEAKER_32]: For the first time in my life, I'm embarrassed to be from this community.

2647
03:34:13,254 --> 03:34:14,115
[SPEAKER_32]: I love this city.

2648
03:34:14,295 --> 03:34:17,338
[SPEAKER_32]: I've loved this city my whole life, and I am embarrassed.

2649
03:34:17,738 --> 03:34:21,241
[SPEAKER_32]: When I go to neighboring towns and other communities, and I get people going, what the hell's going on with your city?

2650
03:34:21,581 --> 03:34:22,602
[SPEAKER_31]: What's going on with your mayor?

2651
03:34:22,822 --> 03:34:23,823
[SPEAKER_31]: What's going on over there?

2652
03:34:24,884 --> 03:34:25,845
[SPEAKER_31]: And we all say the same thing.

2653
03:34:25,885 --> 03:34:27,026
[SPEAKER_31]: I know it's a disaster.

2654
03:34:27,446 --> 03:34:27,967
[SPEAKER_31]: It's a disaster.

2655
03:34:27,987 --> 03:34:30,149
[SPEAKER_31]: I hear every single person behind this rail say it.

2656
03:34:30,189 --> 03:34:31,049
[SPEAKER_31]: I know it's a nightmare.

2657
03:34:31,410 --> 03:34:31,730
[SPEAKER_31]: I know.

2658
03:34:31,890 --> 03:34:32,170
[SPEAKER_31]: I know.

2659
03:34:32,290 --> 03:34:32,771
[SPEAKER_31]: Oh, it's awful.

2660
03:34:32,791 --> 03:34:33,732
[SPEAKER_31]: It's only going to get worse.

2661
03:34:33,972 --> 03:34:34,873
[SPEAKER_31]: Just wait till next year.

2662
03:34:35,273 --> 03:34:35,834
[SPEAKER_31]: And here we are.

2663
03:34:36,684 --> 03:34:37,565
[SPEAKER_31]: Give me the rubber stamp.

2664
03:34:38,407 --> 03:34:39,208
[SPEAKER_31]: Let's stamp it now.

2665
03:34:39,588 --> 03:34:40,390
[SPEAKER_31]: I got what I needed.

2666
03:34:40,830 --> 03:34:43,394
[SPEAKER_31]: Someone might've got a job out of the budget in the closed door deal.

2667
03:34:43,434 --> 03:34:44,336
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't know who got what.

2668
03:34:44,576 --> 03:34:45,718
[SPEAKER_31]: All I know is I got nothing.

2669
03:34:46,661 --> 03:34:47,902
[SPEAKER_32]: All I know is I got nothing.

2670
03:34:48,102 --> 03:34:49,784
[SPEAKER_32]: Not even the courtesy of a telephone call.

2671
03:34:50,284 --> 03:34:51,385
[SPEAKER_32]: I got a text message at 418.

2672
03:34:51,746 --> 03:34:59,432
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm not sure what time you guys met with the mayor, but I got a text message at 418 saying if I have any last minute questions on the budget, let me or Nina know.

2673
03:34:59,672 --> 03:35:00,453
[SPEAKER_31]: A text.

2674
03:35:00,974 --> 03:35:01,414
[SPEAKER_31]: A text.

2675
03:35:01,954 --> 03:35:03,235
[SPEAKER_32]: A text message at four o'clock.

2676
03:35:03,636 --> 03:35:07,679
[SPEAKER_31]: Two hours before a meeting, we were talking about $180 million plus.

2677
03:35:08,540 --> 03:35:10,061
[SPEAKER_32]: Enough's enough with this clown show.

2678
03:35:10,922 --> 03:35:12,362
[SPEAKER_32]: Madam President, I rest my case.

2679
03:35:12,482 --> 03:35:13,683
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm not supporting the budget.

2680
03:35:13,943 --> 03:35:16,243
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm not supporting the budget because I don't feel it's transparent.

2681
03:35:16,323 --> 03:35:19,284
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't feel as though it's an accurate depiction of the finances in this community.

2682
03:35:19,544 --> 03:35:23,585
[SPEAKER_32]: And I don't feel as though it positions us for a future of growth and for a future of success.

2683
03:35:24,145 --> 03:35:26,285
[SPEAKER_31]: All right, our school department is going to fall apart next year.

2684
03:35:28,086 --> 03:35:30,926
[SPEAKER_31]: We're going to have to lay off 33 teachers because all of our SM money is gone.

2685
03:35:30,946 --> 03:35:33,047
[SPEAKER_31]: Nobody cares about that, though.

2686
03:35:33,067 --> 03:35:33,547
[SPEAKER_31]: You know why?

2687
03:35:33,667 --> 03:35:35,427
[SPEAKER_31]: It's going to look good in the press releases this year.

2688
03:35:35,447 --> 03:35:37,728
[SPEAKER_31]: It's going to look good in the campaign material this year.

2689
03:35:38,728 --> 03:35:39,628
[SPEAKER_31]: Time in and time out.

2690
03:35:41,138 --> 03:35:42,018
[SPEAKER_31]: Time in and time out.

2691
03:35:42,278 --> 03:35:44,179
[SPEAKER_31]: What's the number one rule of an elected official?

2692
03:35:44,219 --> 03:35:47,260
[SPEAKER_31]: Once you become an elected official, get reelected.

2693
03:35:47,360 --> 03:35:49,160
[SPEAKER_31]: We all know that, right, Madam President?

2694
03:35:49,180 --> 03:35:50,440
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's put the people first for once.

2695
03:35:50,600 --> 03:35:51,161
[SPEAKER_10]: Enough's enough.

2696
03:35:51,541 --> 03:35:52,141
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Caraviello.

2697
03:35:52,981 --> 03:35:53,821
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Madam President.

2698
03:35:53,941 --> 03:36:02,823
[SPEAKER_10]: And I, too, am quite, maybe hurt and disgusted after sitting on this body for 12 years, being the senior councillor on the board call.

2699
03:36:04,624 --> 03:36:08,745
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe some of the stuff that was talked about today, I could have supported.

2700
03:36:10,026 --> 03:36:14,970
[SPEAKER_10]: Did I get a call saying, hey, Rick, I'm gonna go in to see the mayor.

2701
03:36:15,311 --> 03:36:16,171
[SPEAKER_10]: This is Robert Peralta.

2702
03:36:16,351 --> 03:36:16,992
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you think?

2703
03:36:17,012 --> 03:36:19,354
[SPEAKER_10]: 12 years sitting on this council.

2704
03:36:19,374 --> 03:36:22,597
[SPEAKER_10]: This has never, ever, ever happened to me.

2705
03:36:23,337 --> 03:36:25,539
[SPEAKER_10]: Talk about other administrations with backdoor deals.

2706
03:36:25,860 --> 03:36:29,423
[SPEAKER_10]: My God, this is the thing.

2707
03:36:29,543 --> 03:36:32,345
[SPEAKER_10]: Tonight when we came in, we were informed that this happened.

2708
03:36:32,365 --> 03:36:35,027
[SPEAKER_10]: I tell you, I was close to walking out the door.

2709
03:36:35,933 --> 03:36:36,693
[SPEAKER_10]: It really was.

2710
03:36:36,994 --> 03:36:41,556
[SPEAKER_10]: I think at least a phone call saying, hey, Rick, this is what's happening.

2711
03:36:41,576 --> 03:36:42,757
[SPEAKER_10]: This is what we're going to propose to the mayor.

2712
03:36:42,937 --> 03:36:43,618
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you think?

2713
03:36:44,939 --> 03:36:46,339
[SPEAKER_10]: Didn't even get the courtesy of that.

2714
03:36:46,580 --> 03:36:51,563
[SPEAKER_10]: We talked about all the goddamn cohesiveness of this council all year long, but together, we're together.

2715
03:36:51,903 --> 03:36:56,886
[SPEAKER_10]: And then on the last second, every man for himself here and every woman for themselves.

2716
03:36:57,426 --> 03:36:58,687
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

2717
03:36:58,807 --> 03:37:00,968
[SPEAKER_10]: Transparency out the window.

2718
03:37:01,249 --> 03:37:03,110
[SPEAKER_10]: Unity out the window in this community.

2719
03:37:04,076 --> 03:37:09,777
[SPEAKER_10]: Really, in 12 years, not sitting on this council, never, ever, ever have I been treated like this.

2720
03:37:10,818 --> 03:37:12,178
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm the senior councilor here.

2721
03:37:12,658 --> 03:37:14,178
[SPEAKER_10]: Not one bit of respect was paid.

2722
03:37:14,378 --> 03:37:15,979
[SPEAKER_10]: I respect everybody in this group here.

2723
03:37:17,119 --> 03:37:18,279
[SPEAKER_10]: Shame on everybody here.

2724
03:37:19,140 --> 03:37:19,800
[SPEAKER_10]: Shame.

2725
03:37:21,520 --> 03:37:22,060
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

2726
03:37:25,901 --> 03:37:27,902
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other councilors, fellow councilors wish to speak?

2727
03:37:27,922 --> 03:37:30,442
[SPEAKER_10]: I already spoke.

2728
03:37:31,303 --> 03:37:32,943
[SPEAKER_08]: There are other councilors that haven't spoken.

2729
03:37:36,524 --> 03:37:37,325
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor say.

2730
03:37:38,346 --> 03:37:38,767
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2731
03:37:39,227 --> 03:37:44,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I'm going to speak to the vote in front of us.

2732
03:37:45,473 --> 03:37:49,757
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and I think we all went into this project knowing that it wasn't gonna be a perfect budget.

2733
03:37:49,877 --> 03:37:59,506
[SPEAKER_07]: I went into City Hall today, not knowing how I would vote on this deal, and it actually really helps me to have a better alternative to the budget that was proposed

2734
03:38:00,307 --> 03:38:00,847
[SPEAKER_07]: before.

2735
03:38:01,428 --> 03:38:14,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, now I'm really heartened by the schools and library in the zoning parts, the additions that we've gotten for those three things in the fully, especially the fact that we're fully funding the library and fully funding or zoning ask.

2736
03:38:15,876 --> 03:38:24,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but at the end of the day, when I was thinking about it, um, you know, this was this was just the core of my ask and not

2737
03:38:25,462 --> 03:38:30,290
[SPEAKER_07]: not tied to the structural kind of the structural challenges I saw the Medford budget.

2738
03:38:31,051 --> 03:38:38,583
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, before I asked myself, if I before I was thinking about my decision to vote on this budget.

2739
03:38:39,918 --> 03:38:48,344
[SPEAKER_07]: I ask myself the question I try to return to, which is, will this budget make our city tomorrow better than the city today?

2740
03:38:48,384 --> 03:38:55,489
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, before I walked into City Hall today, even when I was walking into City Hall today, that question was up in the air for me.

2741
03:38:55,909 --> 03:39:00,012
[SPEAKER_07]: But having a better alternative presented to me, I think, gives me some

2742
03:39:02,105 --> 03:39:04,086
[SPEAKER_07]: I had no better alternative.

2743
03:39:04,106 --> 03:39:04,686
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that a question?

2744
03:39:17,775 --> 03:39:28,498
[SPEAKER_07]: A better alternative, in my view, proposed to us on the floor here for us to deliberate about this better alternative, for us to talk about whether this deal is worth accepting.

2745
03:39:28,518 --> 03:39:38,680
[SPEAKER_07]: For me, this deal, I think, is something that I think is moving the city in the right direction, maybe not completely there, but

2746
03:39:39,640 --> 03:39:40,640
[SPEAKER_07]: the direction is correct.

2747
03:39:41,140 --> 03:39:58,524
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it's thanks to the hard work of the residents of the Councilors of different elected of activists who are writing and constantly calling and emailing the mayor's office to get that money for the schools to get the fully funded library to get the zoning money to get some movement on the better future budget plan.

2748
03:39:59,004 --> 03:40:03,585
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think we need to acknowledge and celebrate those successes as well.

2749
03:40:03,905 --> 03:40:05,025
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know, I get that.

2750
03:40:05,805 --> 03:40:08,087
[SPEAKER_07]: there's a lot of anger about how this happened.

2751
03:40:08,187 --> 03:40:19,514
[SPEAKER_07]: And I, you know, I wanted there to be a different plan on the floor with some additions to the budget as we were voting on it.

2752
03:40:19,814 --> 03:40:24,697
[SPEAKER_07]: And this helps me get to a more clear stance on how I'm voting on the budget tonight.

2753
03:40:24,717 --> 03:40:26,939
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

2754
03:40:27,539 --> 03:40:29,020
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Collins has the floor next.

2755
03:40:29,921 --> 03:40:32,543
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you wanna, would you like to go or do you wanna?

2756
03:40:33,328 --> 03:40:43,475
[SPEAKER_24]: The first opportunity that I had to share with all councilors what this was, was when this paper came up on the agenda 15 minutes ago.

2757
03:40:44,055 --> 03:40:47,218
[SPEAKER_24]: I was the first person to speak and I said, these are the details.

2758
03:40:47,998 --> 03:40:53,122
[SPEAKER_24]: That was the first opportunity, the way the law works, that I can share with everybody what we did.

2759
03:40:55,363 --> 03:40:56,944
[SPEAKER_24]: That's what I did, first opportunity.

2760
03:40:57,965 --> 03:40:58,866
[SPEAKER_24]: Literally the first one.

2761
03:41:00,725 --> 03:41:03,368
[SPEAKER_24]: The council leadership team, we had positions on the budget.

2762
03:41:04,108 --> 03:41:17,561
[SPEAKER_24]: It was clear to the mayor that there was Councilors that couldn't support the budget, and she was willing to negotiate something with the President and the Vice President to try to represent the interests of everything we've talked about for the last month.

2763
03:41:17,882 --> 03:41:23,767
[SPEAKER_24]: So we did that, and then at the first opportunity in open session to put it forward and tell you what we did, we did.

2764
03:41:24,941 --> 03:41:31,544
[SPEAKER_24]: So I don't want to hear fraudulent and I don't want to hear dictatorship and I don't want to hear horrible things.

2765
03:41:31,684 --> 03:41:33,124
[SPEAKER_24]: I understand that it feels bad.

2766
03:41:33,144 --> 03:41:41,388
[SPEAKER_24]: I have felt very bad on this council many times when I was not in the leadership, when the leadership made decisions that I didn't like.

2767
03:41:41,668 --> 03:41:46,990
[SPEAKER_24]: And when the leadership ruled my papers out of order and many other things where I wasn't a good, there was no good faith.

2768
03:41:47,010 --> 03:41:48,490
[SPEAKER_24]: There was nothing, there was no even-

2769
03:41:54,873 --> 03:42:14,564
[SPEAKER_24]: If you're interested in a task force that includes us in making decisions about the high school and the fire headquarters and the streets and sidewalks and staffing, or if you're interested in a process where we get to meet six months earlier and get quarterly meetings with the finance department and where we get options to bring our recommendations to her next time.

2770
03:42:15,124 --> 03:42:15,964
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not done yet.

2771
03:42:16,004 --> 03:42:17,465
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not done yet.

2772
03:42:18,106 --> 03:42:22,228
[SPEAKER_16]: And if you're interested in... It's a question because I'm sure this point of information is simple.

2773
03:42:23,404 --> 03:42:41,512
[SPEAKER_16]: The question is this, does this body, the city council, are we not supposed to do what this council just said yes or no, what you just said, are we not supposed to be including what you just said, I'm bringing it to you as the first opportunity to you what I'm saying is, our duties as city Councilors.

2774
03:42:47,054 --> 03:43:07,144
[SPEAKER_16]: supposed to be given the respect of what you negotiated with as a normal process as a city councilor and that's what we want but you didn't do that that's exactly what we get we're gonna get that next budget we we get it anyway we don't by law we get it anyway obviously councilor collins was next to be recognized

2775
03:43:11,686 --> 03:43:18,591
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm just saying, all the things we asked for is what we were able to negotiate the first opportunity in public session I had to bring it to you.

2776
03:43:18,952 --> 03:43:19,272
[SPEAKER_24]: I did.

2777
03:43:19,952 --> 03:43:25,817
[SPEAKER_24]: I gave you a heads up before the meeting, because as a courtesy, because it's the first time I saw you after we had details worked out.

2778
03:43:28,430 --> 03:43:31,632
[SPEAKER_24]: It's the best I could do under the very difficult situation we were in.

2779
03:43:31,992 --> 03:43:39,835
[SPEAKER_24]: The alternative was we get nothing, we vote down the budget, and exactly what happened last year happens again, which is who the heck knows?

2780
03:43:40,676 --> 03:43:44,577
[SPEAKER_24]: So there's a lot here that's good that we all asked for, and I brought it to you.

2781
03:43:44,597 --> 03:43:46,638
[SPEAKER_08]: So- Councilor Collins.

2782
03:43:49,340 --> 03:43:49,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2783
03:43:49,660 --> 03:43:53,902
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little hard to introduce words into this.

2784
03:43:54,790 --> 03:44:05,162
[SPEAKER_05]: climate, and I want to acknowledge that and I'm going to try to speak both my fellow Councilors and to the residents who are watching and I think that's very two very different audiences so I just want to acknowledge that.

2785
03:44:10,649 --> 03:44:11,409
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's my timeline.

2786
03:44:12,349 --> 03:44:20,811
[SPEAKER_05]: I went to the administration in May, and I said, these are my priorities, and I don't think I can vote for a budget that doesn't have these.

2787
03:44:21,091 --> 03:44:23,252
[SPEAKER_05]: I need an increase to the schools department.

2788
03:44:23,952 --> 03:44:25,212
[SPEAKER_05]: I need more money for the libraries.

2789
03:44:26,072 --> 03:44:27,853
[SPEAKER_05]: I need our zoning money back in the budget.

2790
03:44:28,373 --> 03:44:34,954
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to talk about the clerical union, and I need some guarantees that starting next year, the budget process is going to be better.

2791
03:44:34,974 --> 03:44:38,055
[SPEAKER_05]: And at that time, I think pretty loudly, I said,

2792
03:44:39,035 --> 03:44:40,056
[SPEAKER_05]: I need guarantees.

2793
03:44:40,076 --> 03:44:44,259
[SPEAKER_05]: These are these charter amendments that the budget process is going to be better.

2794
03:44:45,640 --> 03:44:46,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Next year.

2795
03:44:46,081 --> 03:44:53,767
[SPEAKER_05]: That was my bottom line because I found the council's role to be largely unmeaningful and I know that's especially hard to hear right now.

2796
03:44:56,709 --> 03:45:04,756
[SPEAKER_05]: But with this vote, I'm trying to put, and I hope that my fellow Councilors can, you know, I don't feel entitled to understanding on this tonight.

2797
03:45:05,728 --> 03:45:11,192
[SPEAKER_05]: But I hope that in time, we can all relate to the feeling of trying to put a desired outcome ahead of my feelings.

2798
03:45:11,212 --> 03:45:17,016
[SPEAKER_05]: And in this case, I have tried to find the utility in being a

2799
03:45:19,226 --> 03:45:26,068
[SPEAKER_05]: protest vote on this budget, and I've seriously, seriously considered it because this budget does not meet my values in many ways.

2800
03:45:26,668 --> 03:45:38,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Even with the increased appropriation to the libraries and the schools and putting zoning money that we should have already had in there back in the budget, it still is not the budget that describes the Medford that we deserve to live in and that our residents deserve to live in.

2801
03:45:39,972 --> 03:45:48,434
[SPEAKER_05]: But I just can't in good conscience say that me voting down this budget, being a vote against this budget, is going to be better for the people who live here

2802
03:45:50,469 --> 03:45:50,809
[SPEAKER_05]: then not.

2803
03:45:52,611 --> 03:46:05,581
[SPEAKER_05]: And I told the administration clearly, more clearly than is comfortable for me as a person, I cannot vote for this budget knowing that the line item is not going to reflect the values that I have, unless we have an assurance that with this budget comes a better budget process next year.

2804
03:46:06,562 --> 03:46:14,088
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's less than I wanted, but it's a role for the council that I don't believe we would have had otherwise.

2805
03:46:14,349 --> 03:46:17,872
[SPEAKER_05]: And it reflects investments in long-term budget planning that I don't think we would have had otherwise.

2806
03:46:18,812 --> 03:46:19,373
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can say,

2807
03:46:20,953 --> 03:46:33,600
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, to residents who probably heard me over the past three weeks saying, I can't vote for this budget if we don't have an assurance that the council, that the residents get to vote on the council's ability to make appropriations starting next year through a charter amendment.

2808
03:46:36,742 --> 03:46:43,225
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope that this, you know, that process is going to continue for me as one Councilor, that process has to continue.

2809
03:46:43,245 --> 03:46:45,806
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to put that, we have to put that to the voters.

2810
03:46:47,787 --> 03:46:50,069
[SPEAKER_05]: In this case, I think that this is,

2811
03:46:51,536 --> 03:46:59,181
[SPEAKER_05]: My vote is about trying to make the best of a situation that I can't celebrate, that I can't feel good about, but I'm trying to do the best that I can with what's in front of us.

2812
03:46:59,721 --> 03:47:01,142
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the context for my vote tonight.

2813
03:47:01,962 --> 03:47:02,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2814
03:47:02,643 --> 03:47:02,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2815
03:47:03,103 --> 03:47:03,743
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Caraviello.

2816
03:47:04,084 --> 03:47:04,804
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Madam President.

2817
03:47:05,845 --> 03:47:09,287
[SPEAKER_10]: So I worked all weekend on budget.

2818
03:47:09,307 --> 03:47:12,889
[SPEAKER_10]: I talked to the people of budget, but I don't know what's changed in the budget.

2819
03:47:13,509 --> 03:47:20,413
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'll ask my questions that maybe someone can answer now.

2820
03:47:22,847 --> 03:47:25,457
[SPEAKER_10]: Are the schools still facing $1 million shortfall?

2821
03:47:38,257 --> 03:47:38,897
[SPEAKER_36]: Madam Chief of Staff.

2822
03:47:39,078 --> 03:47:40,238
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you, President Rao.

2823
03:47:40,258 --> 03:47:41,559
[SPEAKER_36]: Through you to Councilor Caraviello.

2824
03:47:42,520 --> 03:47:51,366
[SPEAKER_36]: As you know, the school department had a roughly $72 million number, just shy of $72 million number that was voted by the school committee.

2825
03:47:51,907 --> 03:48:00,072
[SPEAKER_36]: As of this afternoon, we understand that they have worked with the $71.2 million number that's in the budget proposed.

2826
03:48:00,192 --> 03:48:02,134
[SPEAKER_36]: What was that number?

2827
03:48:02,154 --> 03:48:03,615
[SPEAKER_36]: 71.2, just round numbers.

2828
03:48:05,816 --> 03:48:06,737
[SPEAKER_10]: What was originally proposed?

2829
03:48:08,717 --> 03:48:09,457
[SPEAKER_36]: 7171 round numbers.

2830
03:48:11,898 --> 03:48:15,400
[SPEAKER_36]: My understanding for based on information that I received from the school department.

2831
03:48:16,101 --> 03:48:24,145
[SPEAKER_36]: They have found a way to make the $71.2 million work with their fs or funds to get to where they need to be.

2832
03:48:24,605 --> 03:48:27,687
[SPEAKER_36]: So there is essentially no shortfall, so they're going to be taking $540,000 of the SF funds.

2833
03:48:30,277 --> 03:48:42,002
[SPEAKER_36]: It's my understanding it's about 600 at this point in totality, and then there's $200,000 in cuts, which amount to vacant positions that are no longer needed, according to the school department.

2834
03:48:42,582 --> 03:48:46,104
[SPEAKER_10]: So at the end of this, we have our ESSER account is just about empty now, correct?

2835
03:48:46,924 --> 03:48:53,507
[SPEAKER_36]: That would be what it would essentially roll into fiscal 24 and be utilized, yes.

2836
03:48:53,727 --> 03:48:56,068
[SPEAKER_10]: So how many jobs are gonna be limited in the school budget?

2837
03:48:57,549 --> 03:49:02,152
[SPEAKER_36]: I have no information to suggest that there, with exception of- Would it be like 35, 40 jobs eliminated?

2838
03:49:02,212 --> 03:49:08,956
[SPEAKER_36]: With exception of the $200,000 that I mentioned, I have no specific information that suggests that there would be eliminated jobs.

2839
03:49:08,976 --> 03:49:11,977
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so.

2840
03:49:15,179 --> 03:49:26,566
[SPEAKER_10]: So the school budget relies on $3,150,000, now you're telling me it's more, and that's the fronts, and $700,000 from revolving accounts to cover the cost of paraprofessionals, is that correct?

2841
03:49:27,813 --> 03:49:28,914
[SPEAKER_36]: I don't have the numbers in front of me.

2842
03:49:29,695 --> 03:49:34,160
[SPEAKER_10]: So certainly, but President, we're all through you.

2843
03:49:34,200 --> 03:49:34,701
[SPEAKER_36]: I apologize.

2844
03:49:34,721 --> 03:49:36,343
[SPEAKER_36]: I don't mean to interrupt you, Councilor Caraviello.

2845
03:49:36,683 --> 03:49:41,308
[SPEAKER_36]: But if necessary, I'm happy to request the school superintendent jump on the zoom to answer this.

2846
03:49:41,369 --> 03:49:44,772
[SPEAKER_16]: That'd be nice if she was that was a question I was going to jump in if I can matter.

2847
03:49:44,812 --> 03:49:45,513
[SPEAKER_16]: So information.

2848
03:49:46,074 --> 03:49:48,557
[SPEAKER_16]: Can you tell us who's on the call as department heads?

2849
03:49:49,917 --> 03:49:51,858
[SPEAKER_08]: I just see TPW Commissioner.

2850
03:49:52,038 --> 03:49:54,599
[SPEAKER_08]: I see Director O'Connor.

2851
03:49:55,639 --> 03:49:59,780
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that is, I'm sorry, Director Hahn.

2852
03:50:00,620 --> 03:50:04,442
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, and Barbara Kerr was on earlier, but I don't think she's on any longer.

2853
03:50:04,462 --> 03:50:05,862
[SPEAKER_15]: The superintendent isn't on?

2854
03:50:05,922 --> 03:50:10,063
[SPEAKER_36]: The superintendent isn't on, but if she is- Again, I'm happy to speak with the superintendent.

2855
03:50:10,083 --> 03:50:15,485
[SPEAKER_10]: She knows, she obviously is happy- So do we have any idea what our structural debt and shortfall is gonna be for next year?

2856
03:50:17,062 --> 03:50:28,031
[SPEAKER_36]: Well, as the through you, President morale, as the mayor has mentioned, and as has been stated previously, the city is using approximately $4 million in funds that are one time funds.

2857
03:50:29,172 --> 03:50:30,213
[SPEAKER_36]: So that would be the shortfall.

2858
03:50:31,334 --> 03:50:31,875
[SPEAKER_18]: So what do we do next?

2859
03:50:33,741 --> 03:50:58,880
[SPEAKER_36]: Madam President through you, what we've done for the last several years we're bringing down these numbers to a point where we haven't been used we have presented no revenue replacement for this year's budget, which is a first in the last three years, we've brought that revenue replacement down number down significantly over the past three years, and we've also been working towards bringing these use of one time funds down, that will be the FY 25.

2860
03:51:01,926 --> 03:51:13,815
[SPEAKER_36]: plan and what we need to accomplish in FY 25 because ESSER funds only go through the first quarter of FY 25 and ARPA funds only go through the second quarter.

2861
03:51:14,155 --> 03:51:21,341
[SPEAKER_36]: So we need to make this all work in FY 25 and we are one step closer to that based on this proposed budget.

2862
03:51:21,361 --> 03:51:31,469
[SPEAKER_10]: So in 25, so our next year budget, if we're going on the pace that we're on now, the school's probably going to have to shut, but the school's going to be in bigger problems than they're in now.

2863
03:51:32,176 --> 03:51:32,516
[SPEAKER_10]: way back.

2864
03:51:32,536 --> 03:51:33,296
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2865
03:51:34,377 --> 03:51:48,882
[SPEAKER_36]: Well, President Ralph through you I can't conclude that because in the first year 20 fiscal what would have been the 2022 budget, there was over $13 million used in one time funds, and I say over because the 13 million was revenue replacement.

2866
03:51:49,463 --> 03:51:52,724
[SPEAKER_36]: And that didn't account for other one time fund uses

2867
03:51:53,484 --> 03:51:56,306
[SPEAKER_36]: to actually sustain operating needs.

2868
03:51:57,067 --> 03:52:03,171
[SPEAKER_36]: In FY 23, the one time use of funds was on the order of $7 million if I recall correctly.

2869
03:52:03,191 --> 03:52:07,354
[SPEAKER_36]: And this year, it's $0 for revenue replacement.

2870
03:52:07,474 --> 03:52:12,658
[SPEAKER_36]: But again, there is one time funds on essentially what would be the expenditure side of the budget.

2871
03:52:12,678 --> 03:52:16,481
[SPEAKER_36]: So I can't come to that conclusion because we have been on a downward slope.

2872
03:52:18,914 --> 03:52:19,955
[SPEAKER_10]: is over this year.

2873
03:52:20,595 --> 03:52:21,836
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll skip by the schools.

2874
03:52:22,137 --> 03:52:26,320
[SPEAKER_10]: So I've sat on this council for 12 years now.

2875
03:52:26,760 --> 03:52:31,584
[SPEAKER_10]: In the last three years, we've sat here and begged for money every year.

2876
03:52:32,565 --> 03:52:37,929
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, this administration has a history of over budgeting almost every department here.

2877
03:52:37,949 --> 03:52:47,057
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so in 21 planning developments in 32% of the budget was spent.

2878
03:52:47,797 --> 03:52:48,478
[SPEAKER_10]: Police departments

2879
03:52:48,919 --> 03:52:49,159
[SPEAKER_10]: 51%.

2880
03:52:48,979 --> 03:52:49,159
[SPEAKER_10]: DPW, 52%.

2881
03:52:49,199 --> 03:52:49,720
[SPEAKER_10]: Fire Department, 57%.

2882
03:52:50,240 --> 03:52:51,100
[SPEAKER_10]: DPW, Water and Soil, 59%.

2883
03:52:51,821 --> 03:52:54,243
[SPEAKER_10]: Citywide, our total budget was $143,794 last year.

2884
03:52:54,263 --> 03:52:55,123
[SPEAKER_10]: We only spent $127 million.

2885
03:52:55,143 --> 03:52:57,185
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why we're sitting on all this free cash.

2886
03:52:57,225 --> 03:53:00,887
[SPEAKER_10]: While we sat here and begged for stuff last year and the year before,

2887
03:53:15,145 --> 03:53:18,407
[SPEAKER_10]: The mayor was squirreling away in her little hiding place.

2888
03:53:18,427 --> 03:53:19,908
[SPEAKER_10]: $25 million we're sitting with now.

2889
03:53:20,368 --> 03:53:25,592
[SPEAKER_10]: When a lot of these problems that we're fighting for now could have been resolved last year and the year before.

2890
03:53:27,893 --> 03:53:29,594
[SPEAKER_10]: We only spent 88% of our budget.

2891
03:53:34,998 --> 03:53:37,159
[SPEAKER_10]: The history, go look at your own budget report.

2892
03:53:37,239 --> 03:53:40,461
[SPEAKER_10]: You've over-budgeted every single year for everything in the city.

2893
03:53:41,942 --> 03:53:43,343
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why we got all this money hanging around.

2894
03:53:43,563 --> 03:53:44,324
[SPEAKER_10]: We're begging for stuff.

2895
03:53:45,796 --> 03:53:51,340
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, I just, you know, this is not fiscal transparency at any point.

2896
03:53:52,481 --> 03:54:01,048
[SPEAKER_10]: And I say, and all I say, we sat here and we begged and we begged, and we ended up with nothing last year, and the year before we ended up begging for nothing.

2897
03:54:01,208 --> 03:54:09,114
[SPEAKER_10]: But meanwhile, let's hoard the money and screw away $25 million in account that we don't know what we're gonna spend it.

2898
03:54:09,154 --> 03:54:10,275
[SPEAKER_10]: We're gonna spend it on this year.

2899
03:54:12,096 --> 03:54:12,577
[SPEAKER_36]: Madam President?

2900
03:54:13,057 --> 03:54:13,818
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just, really, it's,

2901
03:54:16,035 --> 03:54:16,395
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.

2902
03:54:16,535 --> 03:54:19,057
[SPEAKER_36]: I'm through to Councilor Caraviello, Councilor Caraviello.

2903
03:54:19,438 --> 03:54:22,500
[SPEAKER_36]: Look, I disagree with your characterization of the matter.

2904
03:54:22,520 --> 03:54:27,945
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you want a response from the chief of staff or no, you don't have that response you put your budget book says it.

2905
03:54:28,125 --> 03:54:29,146
[SPEAKER_08]: Just explain what's in clear gov.

2906
03:54:41,032 --> 03:54:44,154
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm only going with the numbers you presented to us, through your budget book.

2907
03:54:44,494 --> 03:54:46,896
[SPEAKER_36]: I wasn't given an opportunity to present a full answer.

2908
03:54:46,916 --> 03:54:49,078
[SPEAKER_08]: No, you presented, but that's the budget you presented to me.

2909
03:54:49,098 --> 03:54:53,321
[SPEAKER_08]: Director Dickinson, do you want to offer some clarity?

2910
03:54:53,341 --> 03:54:56,263
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a patent.

2911
03:55:00,313 --> 03:55:02,614
[SPEAKER_13]: questions.

2912
03:55:02,754 --> 03:55:02,854
[SPEAKER_13]: Um.

2913
03:55:02,874 --> 03:55:03,314
[SPEAKER_13]: 25 million.

2914
03:55:03,434 --> 03:55:08,136
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe you've got the information on why that actually happened.

2915
03:55:08,176 --> 03:55:11,477
[SPEAKER_13]: It came from the 2022 recap.

2916
03:55:12,437 --> 03:55:16,619
[SPEAKER_10]: Where literally do we do we not over budget the last three years?

2917
03:55:16,679 --> 03:55:18,819
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Caraviello, please let me answer that question.

2918
03:55:18,839 --> 03:55:19,860
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we not over budget?

2919
03:55:20,860 --> 03:55:22,201
[SPEAKER_13]: Well okay.

2920
03:55:22,221 --> 03:55:23,961
[SPEAKER_13]: First of all, you should always over

2921
03:55:30,379 --> 03:55:32,360
[SPEAKER_08]: You've asked, then continue.

2922
03:55:34,361 --> 03:55:37,022
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, Director Dickinson has the floor, please continue.

2923
03:55:37,282 --> 03:55:39,143
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, yes.

2924
03:55:39,203 --> 03:55:41,924
[SPEAKER_13]: For 2022, that budget was over-budgeted.

2925
03:55:41,944 --> 03:55:44,186
[SPEAKER_13]: This year's budget is much closer.

2926
03:55:45,066 --> 03:55:47,207
[SPEAKER_13]: Fiscal 2023 is much closer.

2927
03:55:47,847 --> 03:55:50,589
[SPEAKER_13]: Fiscal 2024, we refined the numbers.

2928
03:55:51,049 --> 03:55:56,191
[SPEAKER_13]: We're trying, that's what we're trying to make sure we're doing.

2929
03:55:56,271 --> 03:55:57,832
[SPEAKER_13]: We're not over-budgeting anything.

2930
03:55:59,196 --> 03:56:08,759
[SPEAKER_13]: and I'm trying to be as close as possible on my predictions for the recap, so we can use every available dollar, so we do not have to use one-time funds.

2931
03:56:09,740 --> 03:56:13,821
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the whole point, is to get the city back to paying as it goes.

2932
03:56:15,001 --> 03:56:17,962
[SPEAKER_13]: And yes, there's a bunch of money sitting in free cash.

2933
03:56:18,483 --> 03:56:24,305
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a bunch of uses that this council could vote for, for using that, but those are one-time funds.

2934
03:56:24,785 --> 03:56:28,426
[SPEAKER_13]: We need to get away from spending one-time funds on operating budgets.

2935
03:56:30,273 --> 03:56:36,514
[SPEAKER_13]: We need to make the revenue pay for what we're doing on an operating basis.

2936
03:56:39,555 --> 03:56:52,398
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm saying there's a pattern here of over-budgeting for the last three years by your own budget book, not Rick Caraviello's numbers coming out of the sky.

2937
03:56:52,418 --> 03:56:53,198
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's got a computer here?

2938
03:56:53,659 --> 03:56:54,439
[SPEAKER_10]: Anybody got a computer?

2939
03:56:54,479 --> 03:56:55,459
[SPEAKER_10]: Pull up the budget.

2940
03:56:57,156 --> 03:57:01,260
[SPEAKER_10]: up the budget and see how much money you over budgeted.

2941
03:57:01,500 --> 03:57:03,122
[SPEAKER_10]: Not you per se, because you weren't here.

2942
03:57:03,222 --> 03:57:04,824
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor, I'm not denying that.

2943
03:57:05,965 --> 03:57:07,486
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm definitely not denying that.

2944
03:57:07,526 --> 03:57:09,028
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the thing we're trying to fix.

2945
03:57:15,779 --> 03:57:18,800
[SPEAKER_16]: This is, this council is gonna vote on a budget today.

2946
03:57:19,200 --> 03:57:24,623
[SPEAKER_16]: And we talked about, there was some changes that were made that really made you think of, this is what we need.

2947
03:57:25,603 --> 03:57:28,845
[SPEAKER_16]: So I asked my fellow councilors to listen to what we just heard.

2948
03:57:30,125 --> 03:57:34,307
[SPEAKER_16]: We're gonna take $500,000, $600,000 of ESSER money.

2949
03:57:34,947 --> 03:57:38,629
[SPEAKER_16]: We're gonna settle the budget on an election year to make everybody happy.

2950
03:57:39,309 --> 03:57:43,491
[SPEAKER_16]: And then next year, the teachers that you talk about, the kids that you talk about that you love,

2951
03:57:45,282 --> 03:57:47,943
[SPEAKER_16]: We're gonna be in such dire disrepair.

2952
03:57:48,783 --> 03:57:50,184
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know how we're gonna dig out of it.

2953
03:57:51,924 --> 03:57:52,844
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what's frightening.

2954
03:57:53,065 --> 03:57:54,405
[SPEAKER_16]: Understand what we're doing right now.

2955
03:57:55,085 --> 03:57:58,946
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Caraviello presented the numbers that came out of the budget book.

2956
03:57:58,966 --> 03:58:12,731
[SPEAKER_16]: And I appreciate the numbers you shared with me, because these are outstanding numbers that when we talk about funding for this community, of funding for a budget, of funding for a prop two and a half, of funding for these different projects, understand this.

2957
03:58:15,148 --> 03:58:22,793
[SPEAKER_16]: Planning and development $703,000 budgeted 226,000 was used 32% was the budget was spent 32% we spent police 14.3, we spent 7.4 51% of the budget wasn't spent.

2958
03:58:35,762 --> 03:58:42,247
[SPEAKER_16]: DPW 12.9 spent 6.7, 52% of the budget wasn't spent.

2959
03:58:43,088 --> 03:58:47,911
[SPEAKER_16]: Fire department, excuse me, after DPW, these are the big five right now that we're bringing up.

2960
03:58:48,812 --> 03:58:59,120
[SPEAKER_16]: So the total expenditure is we're looking at, we're talking millions of dollars that have been mismanaged that we could have used

2961
03:59:00,250 --> 03:59:08,956
[SPEAKER_16]: that we could have used to fix these gaps in the library, to fix the gaps in the school department, to fix the gaps on the streets and sidewalks.

2962
03:59:09,876 --> 03:59:15,280
[SPEAKER_16]: Instead, this council voted for bonds, 2.5 million, 2 million.

2963
03:59:15,580 --> 03:59:18,522
[SPEAKER_16]: We voted for bonds to do the work that was already in the budget, sir.

2964
03:59:19,723 --> 03:59:20,683
[SPEAKER_16]: These are your numbers.

2965
03:59:20,743 --> 03:59:22,464
[SPEAKER_16]: These are the numbers that came from this city.

2966
03:59:24,349 --> 03:59:33,460
[SPEAKER_16]: To see that we over-budgeted this much money is a gross, a gross mishandling of our city's funds.

2967
03:59:33,540 --> 03:59:37,705
[SPEAKER_16]: Not yours, not mine, this community's funds.

2968
03:59:38,966 --> 03:59:40,128
[SPEAKER_16]: This is appalling.

2969
03:59:40,148 --> 03:59:43,171
[SPEAKER_16]: We talked about millions and millions of dollars that we didn't use.

2970
03:59:44,602 --> 03:59:55,131
[SPEAKER_16]: So listen, I'm looking at apples to apples before we got this information, before we got to finally sit down, because when you get the budget book on the Friday or Father's Day weekend, it's really tough to see.

2971
03:59:56,012 --> 04:00:04,580
[SPEAKER_16]: And when we get to this point and we talk about what are we doing, in most communities, as you brought up, Madam Chief of Staff,

2972
04:00:05,430 --> 04:00:09,412
[SPEAKER_16]: In most communities, like tomorrow night, I'll be sitting in Somerville, it's called Cut Night.

2973
04:00:10,173 --> 04:00:13,695
[SPEAKER_16]: Every department head will be here to support any questions at the council.

2974
04:00:13,915 --> 04:00:15,176
[SPEAKER_16]: That's the respect they get.

2975
04:00:16,437 --> 04:00:23,081
[SPEAKER_16]: The biggest budget line we have is education, and our superintendent isn't even here to answer a question.

2976
04:00:23,641 --> 04:00:27,943
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I had other questions that was brought to my attention after looking at the capital plan.

2977
04:00:28,444 --> 04:00:31,926
[SPEAKER_16]: For instance, the neglected fields behind Medford High School.

2978
04:00:33,035 --> 04:00:45,843
[SPEAKER_16]: that have been out past this day over five years, that if we end up doing a study, which happens every year, it should, and it shows that that field is unsafe, we have to close two of the most important fields down the city.

2979
04:00:46,843 --> 04:00:49,825
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't see anything, which is a huge revenue generator.

2980
04:00:50,566 --> 04:00:53,868
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's what I was going to ask the superintendent tonight, but she's not here.

2981
04:00:55,100 --> 04:01:05,684
[SPEAKER_16]: These are serious issues that we don't have any department head in front of us that we can ask these questions, because I would love to talk to the department heads, because I'm gonna be honest with you.

2982
04:01:06,044 --> 04:01:07,524
[SPEAKER_16]: I've talked to some department heads.

2983
04:01:08,545 --> 04:01:15,087
[SPEAKER_16]: I've talked to people that are in the know, because believe it or not, there are still relationships here, and they're petrified.

2984
04:01:15,427 --> 04:01:16,868
[SPEAKER_16]: George, don't ever speak my name.

2985
04:01:17,188 --> 04:01:22,030
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want you to understand that the confusion they have

2986
04:01:23,021 --> 04:01:25,522
[SPEAKER_16]: with the way we run a budget, they're very confused.

2987
04:01:26,682 --> 04:01:32,663
[SPEAKER_16]: Because when they do their lines, and they then match up what's presented to them, they're totally confused.

2988
04:01:33,903 --> 04:01:47,086
[SPEAKER_16]: And I bet you what, if I do a Freedom of Information Act, and I ask for any communications between department heads to a director of finance, we're gonna see some questions that department heads are very confused.

2989
04:01:48,769 --> 04:01:59,372
[SPEAKER_16]: So when we talk about this budget, when we've been talking about this budget as a union, we've been talking about what the mismanagement has been with this council for months, if not a year.

2990
04:01:59,652 --> 04:02:02,593
[SPEAKER_16]: For what we've been promised, what we weren't, remember that.

2991
04:02:02,613 --> 04:02:08,795
[SPEAKER_16]: Remember, I'm gonna not say the council's name, but remember, I will never let that happen to me again.

2992
04:02:09,215 --> 04:02:10,375
[SPEAKER_16]: The mayor lied to me.

2993
04:02:10,875 --> 04:02:12,356
[SPEAKER_16]: I will never let it happen to me again.

2994
04:02:14,005 --> 04:02:16,330
[SPEAKER_16]: She promises everything last year at one o'clock in the morning.

2995
04:02:16,851 --> 04:02:17,492
[SPEAKER_16]: We get nothing.

2996
04:02:17,993 --> 04:02:24,847
[SPEAKER_16]: Here we are today to consider that you're going to vote for this budget with these questions befuddling.

2997
04:02:28,168 --> 04:02:29,849
[SPEAKER_16]: So these are serious issues.

2998
04:02:30,129 --> 04:02:38,134
[SPEAKER_16]: These are issues that this councilor, I'm going to reach out and find out on what avenues we can take to do a deep dive in this.

2999
04:02:38,194 --> 04:02:41,576
[SPEAKER_16]: I know we do an audit, but this is something that frightens me.

3000
04:02:42,036 --> 04:02:44,638
[SPEAKER_16]: And if Councilor Caraviello said it's a pattern, this is one year.

3001
04:02:45,198 --> 04:02:47,940
[SPEAKER_16]: If it's a pattern for three years, what are we doing?

3002
04:02:48,260 --> 04:02:51,262
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a gross mismanagement of our city funds.

3003
04:02:52,802 --> 04:02:54,203
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a gross mismanagement.

3004
04:02:54,604 --> 04:02:54,944
[SPEAKER_16]: And again,

3005
04:02:56,578 --> 04:03:03,443
[SPEAKER_16]: Take a deep breath, go sit down with your budget book, because when I asked this question, if this was real or not, it's in your numbers.

3006
04:03:04,824 --> 04:03:05,565
[SPEAKER_16]: It's in your book.

3007
04:03:07,146 --> 04:03:12,050
[SPEAKER_16]: These are not just a couple of percent, because I've asked a couple of finance directors in neighboring communities.

3008
04:03:12,631 --> 04:03:15,713
[SPEAKER_16]: Rarely you look at an overage about two and a half to three and a half percent, correct?

3009
04:03:15,753 --> 04:03:16,994
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what they look at, usually.

3010
04:03:17,755 --> 04:03:23,299
[SPEAKER_16]: That's the gap that other communities they say that they put into, about two and a half to three and a half percent.

3011
04:03:25,554 --> 04:03:32,139
[SPEAKER_16]: 32, 51, 52, 57, 59, that's only five departments that we over budgeted.

3012
04:03:33,060 --> 04:03:41,986
[SPEAKER_16]: So if this council wants to vote for this budget, when you hear these facts and say, this is better for our community, think about it.

3013
04:03:42,106 --> 04:03:48,350
[SPEAKER_16]: Think about it, no matter what was said or what was negotiated, think about what the numbers in front of you say before you vote.

3014
04:03:48,531 --> 04:03:51,773
[SPEAKER_16]: And I tell you, if you support this with this information in front of you,

3015
04:03:54,352 --> 04:04:03,018
[SPEAKER_16]: I hope everybody's watching, because remember, you vote, and you represent every member of this community, and you're their fiscal watchdog.

3016
04:04:04,199 --> 04:04:05,741
[SPEAKER_16]: That's why I appreciate your hard work.

3017
04:04:06,101 --> 04:04:08,743
[SPEAKER_16]: When we talked and you gave me this, I couldn't believe it.

3018
04:04:08,803 --> 04:04:09,723
[SPEAKER_16]: I went back and I looked.

3019
04:04:09,743 --> 04:04:12,425
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not a really numbers guy.

3020
04:04:12,506 --> 04:04:15,328
[SPEAKER_16]: I went and sat with a few people that I can talk to.

3021
04:04:16,124 --> 04:04:17,045
[SPEAKER_16]: And they couldn't believe it.

3022
04:04:17,825 --> 04:04:20,146
[SPEAKER_10]: I spent the weekend with numbers people.

3023
04:04:20,487 --> 04:04:21,427
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not a numbers guy either.

3024
04:04:21,747 --> 04:04:26,330
[SPEAKER_10]: I sat with two budget people who looked at this and one looked at me like I had two heads.

3025
04:04:26,770 --> 04:04:27,151
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

3026
04:04:27,471 --> 04:04:32,334
[SPEAKER_16]: If this is gonna be, if tonight's gonna be a gotcha game or you win or we win, we all lose if this budget passes.

3027
04:04:32,614 --> 04:04:33,375
[SPEAKER_16]: That's all I have to say.

3028
04:04:33,415 --> 04:04:33,895
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you.

3029
04:04:34,335 --> 04:04:36,757
[SPEAKER_08]: We have Vice President Bears next.

3030
04:04:36,797 --> 04:04:37,817
[SPEAKER_16]: Just if they have a response.

3031
04:04:40,285 --> 04:04:44,531
[SPEAKER_36]: The only thing I was going to say at this point, I apologize to MCM for moving the microphone.

3032
04:04:45,352 --> 04:04:55,386
[SPEAKER_36]: The only thing I was going to attempt to say and this was at the point in which President Ralph through you, Councilor car VLO had indicated that, you know, these numbers are.

3033
04:04:57,128 --> 04:05:02,673
[SPEAKER_36]: significantly underneath what was actually spent, is that I do believe that there must be an hour here.

3034
04:05:03,514 --> 04:05:15,745
[SPEAKER_36]: I really do not believe that in fact and I don't know what fiscal year Councilor Caraviello was referring to and if possible if you could refer us to the specific pages in the budget book or Councilor scarpia scars scarpelli if he has that information.

3035
04:05:16,966 --> 04:05:21,210
[SPEAKER_36]: I do not believe that there's a scenario where the planning division only spent.

3036
04:05:22,151 --> 04:05:26,053
[SPEAKER_36]: what would amount to be two thirds or at least one third of their of their funds.

3037
04:05:26,613 --> 04:05:31,055
[SPEAKER_36]: I don't believe that the police department only spent half what would amount to be half of their funds.

3038
04:05:31,136 --> 04:05:32,116
[SPEAKER_36]: It's virtually impossible.

3039
04:05:32,156 --> 04:05:35,118
[SPEAKER_36]: There has to be an issue here in the information.

3040
04:05:35,638 --> 04:05:38,499
[SPEAKER_36]: And if there isn't an issue in the information, we're happy to correct that.

3041
04:05:39,600 --> 04:05:42,161
[SPEAKER_36]: I just want to finish my statement if I may.

3042
04:05:42,701 --> 04:05:44,642
[SPEAKER_32]: And I want to finish my question, Madam President.

3043
04:05:44,762 --> 04:05:45,403
[SPEAKER_32]: Ultimately, right.

3044
04:05:45,863 --> 04:05:46,443
[SPEAKER_32]: We've been asking.

3045
04:05:47,103 --> 04:05:48,164
[SPEAKER_32]: We've been asking.

3046
04:05:48,464 --> 04:05:50,205
[SPEAKER_32]: We've been asking for financial documentation.

3047
04:05:50,745 --> 04:05:51,906
[SPEAKER_32]: for two years and haven't gotten it.

3048
04:05:52,086 --> 04:05:54,267
[SPEAKER_32]: And now here we are at the budget and you say no, that's a mistake.

3049
04:05:55,027 --> 04:05:55,687
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, that's a mistake.

3050
04:05:55,887 --> 04:06:04,151
[SPEAKER_32]: Maybe if they shared this information with us that we've been asking for, as the conduit of communication per the city ordinance that the chief of staff was as a badge.

3051
04:06:05,331 --> 04:06:08,073
[SPEAKER_32]: Maybe if some of this do you have a question for me?

3052
04:06:08,093 --> 04:06:08,413
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, I do.

3053
04:06:08,993 --> 04:06:09,193
[SPEAKER_32]: I do.

3054
04:06:09,613 --> 04:06:13,355
[SPEAKER_32]: How is it that we're planning a budget based upon figures that are mistakes?

3055
04:06:14,714 --> 04:06:16,035
[SPEAKER_24]: It's just clear that sucks.

3056
04:06:16,175 --> 04:06:25,302
[SPEAKER_26]: It's all this is, you know, so, so, so, so, so, so when it comes to clear that sucks.

3057
04:06:25,382 --> 04:06:32,247
[SPEAKER_26]: And when it comes time for us to do our research, we know clear that's not good so we asked for the information and we don't get the information, but then we're expected to make an informed decision.

3058
04:06:32,887 --> 04:06:38,612
[SPEAKER_32]: And then when it comes down to us actually sitting down and having a transparent discussion, the mayor doesn't divide and conquer strategy.

3059
04:06:39,432 --> 04:06:41,535
[SPEAKER_32]: You know, so that's where we're at in this whole thing.

3060
04:06:41,555 --> 04:06:42,176
[SPEAKER_32]: This is a joke.

3061
04:06:42,296 --> 04:06:42,877
[SPEAKER_08]: You've asked your question.

3062
04:06:42,897 --> 04:06:43,858
[SPEAKER_08]: Madam Chief of Staff, please continue.

3063
04:06:43,878 --> 04:06:46,101
[SPEAKER_08]: I also see Director Hunt as a departmental director.

3064
04:06:46,121 --> 04:06:46,682
[SPEAKER_08]: She has her hand up.

3065
04:06:46,722 --> 04:06:48,304
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if she can add some light to the situation.

3066
04:06:48,747 --> 04:06:54,492
[SPEAKER_36]: I certainly would defer to her, President Morales she's one of the listed departments that may have some input on this matter.

3067
04:06:56,073 --> 04:07:11,366
[SPEAKER_36]: The thought that I had that I wanted to state at the end was, I think it's an oversimplification if there is truly the delta which I'm sure there are deltas between what was actually funded, and what was actually expand while I don't believe the deltas that were read are accurate.

3068
04:07:12,186 --> 04:07:18,096
[SPEAKER_36]: If there is truly a delta which there would always almost always be a delta otherwise we're presenting a transfer paper.

3069
04:07:19,058 --> 04:07:22,684
[SPEAKER_36]: It's important to note that there are things that obviously happened throughout the year that

3070
04:07:23,588 --> 04:07:27,671
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you use a different word other than Delta?

3071
04:07:27,751 --> 04:07:32,795
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes, a difference between the amount that was budgeted and the amount that was actually expended as I said earlier.

3072
04:07:33,455 --> 04:07:34,256
[SPEAKER_36]: So but thank you for that.

3073
04:07:35,177 --> 04:07:44,643
[SPEAKER_36]: So, all I'm attempting to communicate, and hopefully I can actually get through this sentence before someone interrupts me with a point of information would be to say that essentially,

3074
04:07:45,464 --> 04:07:59,981
[SPEAKER_36]: There are times when positions are either vacant or there's a retirement it takes time to replace that position that creates what I call float that float adds to what ultimately falls to free cash if unexpended.

3075
04:08:00,821 --> 04:08:16,304
[SPEAKER_36]: Other scenarios present themselves where costs do not meet the levels that were expected or as we've seen, based on the pandemic purchases couldn't be made because of various factors that relate to the industrial economy and the manufacturing economy.

3076
04:08:16,624 --> 04:08:27,547
[SPEAKER_36]: So, I just want to point out that this is an oversimplification to suggest that we've been over budgeting, and I want to state a correction to what essentially modification to what the budget director stated.

3077
04:08:27,587 --> 04:08:27,887
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.

3078
04:08:28,547 --> 04:08:32,548
[SPEAKER_10]: This pattern goes back to 2020, 21 and 22.

3079
04:08:32,708 --> 04:08:36,489
[SPEAKER_10]: Go look, go look at your own book that you put out.

3080
04:08:36,509 --> 04:08:38,249
[SPEAKER_10]: These aren't made up numbers.

3081
04:08:38,269 --> 04:08:41,230
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, so you want to say this year that we had some unknown factors?

3082
04:08:41,430 --> 04:08:42,450
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, what happened last year?

3083
04:08:42,650 --> 04:08:43,610
[SPEAKER_10]: What happened the year before that?

3084
04:08:43,630 --> 04:08:44,790
[SPEAKER_10]: What happened the last three years?

3085
04:08:46,391 --> 04:08:49,731
[SPEAKER_32]: Let's just look at the law department as an example, Madam President.

3086
04:08:49,851 --> 04:08:53,132
[SPEAKER_32]: Now, we haven't had a city solicitor or an assistant city solicitor for a year.

3087
04:08:54,312 --> 04:08:56,353
[SPEAKER_32]: Last year, we budgeted what, about $422,000?

3088
04:08:58,902 --> 04:09:00,122
[SPEAKER_32]: We still don't have a city solicitor.

3089
04:09:00,142 --> 04:09:03,763
[SPEAKER_32]: We still don't have an assistant city solicitor, yet the department's budget goes up.

3090
04:09:04,503 --> 04:09:05,264
[SPEAKER_31]: How does that happen?

3091
04:09:05,284 --> 04:09:08,524
[SPEAKER_31]: There's nobody even in the office, but the department's budget is going up.

3092
04:09:08,604 --> 04:09:11,165
[SPEAKER_31]: There's no employees there except for Janice.

3093
04:09:11,605 --> 04:09:13,685
[SPEAKER_32]: There's one person in the office, but the budget goes up.

3094
04:09:14,026 --> 04:09:16,506
[SPEAKER_32]: How is that possible if the positions are vacant?

3095
04:09:16,886 --> 04:09:20,347
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't wanna hear we pass the COLA, because the person that comes in should be starting at step one.

3096
04:09:20,987 --> 04:09:26,128
[SPEAKER_31]: So I don't wanna hear we pass the COLA, because that's just another way to control a false narrative.

3097
04:09:26,148 --> 04:09:27,329
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have a question, Vice President?

3098
04:09:27,349 --> 04:09:28,169
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, how did it happen?

3099
04:09:28,769 --> 04:09:31,693
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, why are we giving the city solicitor a raise when the position is vacant?

3100
04:09:31,834 --> 04:09:35,980
[SPEAKER_26]: Why is the budget in this the law office going up when the two positions that have funded through the vacant?

3101
04:09:37,522 --> 04:09:39,785
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I'm gonna go to Director Hunt and then we'll go back.

3102
04:09:40,146 --> 04:09:42,169
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, please don't.

3103
04:09:49,158 --> 04:09:50,438
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you, Madam President.

3104
04:09:50,979 --> 04:09:58,341
[SPEAKER_43]: As a department head who was here through that whole period, I can explain it with all due respect to Director Dickinson.

3105
04:09:58,821 --> 04:10:00,502
[SPEAKER_43]: He's more recent and wasn't around.

3106
04:10:01,122 --> 04:10:06,604
[SPEAKER_43]: In fiscal year 20, when the pandemic hit in March 2020, we were told to stop spending.

3107
04:10:07,864 --> 04:10:16,447
[SPEAKER_43]: So there was a huge reduction in any projects, all ground to a halt, and a lot of open POs never got paid out because we had to stop work.

3108
04:10:16,587 --> 04:10:20,229
[SPEAKER_43]: And work didn't really resume in any sense of normalcy for a year.

3109
04:10:20,689 --> 04:10:24,190
[SPEAKER_43]: There were a lot of projects that we couldn't do during fiscal year 21.

3110
04:10:24,710 --> 04:10:28,812
[SPEAKER_43]: And in December of 2021, or 2020, so fiscal year 21, we were directed to freeze our budgets again.

3111
04:10:32,523 --> 04:10:46,706
[SPEAKER_43]: and to stop spending so any discretionary spending stopped, which accounts for a lot of the overspending and underspending in my department and fiscal year 22 the budget freezes came in April.

3112
04:10:47,498 --> 04:10:50,861
[SPEAKER_43]: And so we couldn't spend and it became extremely hard to hire.

3113
04:10:51,902 --> 04:10:56,746
[SPEAKER_43]: Fiscal year 23 numbers, the numbers in the budget are from March.

3114
04:10:57,206 --> 04:11:06,474
[SPEAKER_43]: So any department that is heavy in personnel is missing 25% of their expenditures because you're not seeing the full year expenditures.

3115
04:11:06,514 --> 04:11:09,737
[SPEAKER_43]: They're not even year to date for June, they're from March.

3116
04:11:10,177 --> 04:11:14,281
[SPEAKER_43]: And a lot of our projects have heavy expenditures in April,

3117
04:11:15,506 --> 04:11:26,037
[SPEAKER_43]: May and June, a responsible department head does not spend most of their budget in the first six months of the year, they portion it out, and a lot of the spending occurs in late in the year.

3118
04:11:26,477 --> 04:11:28,980
[SPEAKER_43]: That's why these budgets were underspent.

3119
04:11:29,761 --> 04:11:31,462
[SPEAKER_43]: You can see before the pandemic.

3120
04:11:37,014 --> 04:11:47,422
[SPEAKER_43]: the, frankly, I'm gonna have to dig back, but whenever I get a directive to stop spending, it comes from the finance director, tells us to freeze the budgets.

3121
04:11:47,903 --> 04:11:50,765
[SPEAKER_43]: So it would have been Aleesha Nunley in fiscal year 20 and 21.

3122
04:11:51,205 --> 04:11:57,490
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, and didn't we not have vacancies in the finance director's position during that period of time?

3123
04:11:57,790 --> 04:11:59,131
[SPEAKER_43]: In fiscal year 22.

3124
04:12:00,152 --> 04:12:02,994
[SPEAKER_43]: And in her absence, we would hear from the chief of staff.

3125
04:12:03,955 --> 04:12:04,756
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you very much.

3126
04:12:05,612 --> 04:12:05,812
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

3127
04:12:06,172 --> 04:12:07,113
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Director Hunt.

3128
04:12:07,333 --> 04:12:09,673
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to go to Vice President Bears, and then Councilor Tseng.

3129
04:12:09,693 --> 04:12:10,794
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we'll go back.

3130
04:12:10,834 --> 04:12:12,615
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm trying to keep it to two sentences after this one.

3131
04:12:15,956 --> 04:12:19,857
[SPEAKER_24]: The answers to the questions that we asked the administration have come back to us by email.

3132
04:12:19,897 --> 04:12:21,858
[SPEAKER_24]: If we read the answers, they show that

3133
04:12:23,186 --> 04:12:29,369
[SPEAKER_24]: The administration has said that ClearGov is a bad software and that the actual numbers for expenditures in ClearGov are not reliable.

3134
04:12:29,889 --> 04:12:33,771
[SPEAKER_24]: That's one of the issues that we had around the surplus question that I asked you at the beginning.

3135
04:12:33,931 --> 04:12:37,773
[SPEAKER_24]: So there's inaccurate, let's not dodge it, Rick.

3136
04:12:38,634 --> 04:12:43,816
[SPEAKER_24]: There's inaccurate information in ClearGov about actual expenditures that don't reflect the real actuals.

3137
04:12:43,856 --> 04:12:45,557
[SPEAKER_24]: That was sent to us weeks ago.

3138
04:12:45,817 --> 04:12:48,679
[SPEAKER_24]: We've had that information for weeks and the question and answers that have been sent to us.

3139
04:12:49,898 --> 04:13:03,987
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm concerned about next year's budget and the cliff, which is why we now work together to get a task force and a budget process starting in January so that we open the whole thing up and have these questions and discussions and the information that we need.

3140
04:13:04,327 --> 04:13:05,388
[SPEAKER_24]: And it's a public commitment.

3141
04:13:05,888 --> 04:13:06,748
[SPEAKER_24]: And you know what?

3142
04:13:07,489 --> 04:13:08,730
[SPEAKER_24]: That's what we needed to get there.

3143
04:13:08,850 --> 04:13:10,731
[SPEAKER_24]: So I'm gonna move to end debate.

3144
04:13:10,791 --> 04:13:11,752
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm moving to end debate.

3145
04:13:11,772 --> 04:13:15,314
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a motion to end debate.

3146
04:13:15,334 --> 04:13:16,074
[SPEAKER_08]: We have to vote on that.

3147
04:13:16,114 --> 04:13:18,836
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a motion from Vice President Bears to end debate.

3148
04:13:19,782 --> 04:13:23,523
[SPEAKER_15]: So we can, so we have other questions.

3149
04:13:23,843 --> 04:13:25,724
[SPEAKER_08]: We can, you can vote again, sending debate.

3150
04:13:25,744 --> 04:13:28,865
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a motion for Senator Bears to end debate.

3151
04:13:29,305 --> 04:13:31,525
[SPEAKER_08]: Do I have a second from Councilor Knight?

3152
04:13:35,146 --> 04:13:36,647
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a motion, I'm going to take it.

3153
04:13:36,707 --> 04:13:39,227
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

3154
04:13:50,356 --> 04:13:55,618
[SPEAKER_15]: The question was that we have something public that the mayor is agreed with.

3155
04:13:55,638 --> 04:13:58,520
[SPEAKER_15]: Did she not publicly give us other issues last year?

3156
04:13:59,080 --> 04:14:00,921
[SPEAKER_15]: Do we not have other public issues last year?

3157
04:14:00,941 --> 04:14:02,121
[SPEAKER_15]: Is this what you're going to do?

3158
04:14:14,655 --> 04:14:17,938
[SPEAKER_08]: No, three in the affirmative for the negative emotion fails.

3159
04:14:19,299 --> 04:14:20,380
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Tseng as a floor next.

3160
04:14:22,642 --> 04:14:23,963
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, President role.

3161
04:14:24,503 --> 04:14:28,466
[SPEAKER_07]: If we're looking at where if we're using the actuals in the budget books and clear gov.

3162
04:14:29,747 --> 04:14:35,732
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to reinforce, they only go until March, and so we are going to be missing a quarter of the numbers.

3163
04:14:37,433 --> 04:14:54,698
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, because if you're looking at the budget book that was posted online that was made during budget season so those also clarification though but didn't you speak about figures from as well which I was just explaining that if you're looking at what was given to us physically and if you're looking at what was given to us physically and on the website.

3164
04:14:55,718 --> 04:15:05,561
[SPEAKER_07]: They those numbers also only go into March, so for all those years we're going to, we're going to be missing a quarter of the actual point of information.

3165
04:15:07,963 --> 04:15:17,991
[SPEAKER_24]: Could one of you just say that the numbers that for actual expenditures in ClearGov, they are not updated regularly and not correct the correct numbers in ClearGov for the actual expenditures for several of the recent fiscal years?

3166
04:15:19,994 --> 04:15:20,895
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, that is true.

3167
04:15:21,135 --> 04:15:24,258
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you point of information point of information.

3168
04:15:26,781 --> 04:15:29,323
[SPEAKER_16]: So, with this information you just gave us.

3169
04:15:29,944 --> 04:15:35,369
[SPEAKER_16]: You just openly told us that the numbers we have aren't true, how can we go to this budget should we vote on this budget.

3170
04:15:40,356 --> 04:15:48,882
[SPEAKER_13]: The back end of ClearGov is very problematic and its summaries are somewhat unreliable.

3171
04:15:49,563 --> 04:15:58,849
[SPEAKER_13]: I can tell you right now for fiscal 2022, the total number of turnbacks in budgets in the general fund was slightly less than $5.9 million.

3172
04:16:00,669 --> 04:16:05,833
[SPEAKER_13]: Most of that was due to an inaccurate health insurance number.

3173
04:16:06,114 --> 04:16:08,876
[SPEAKER_13]: $2.4 million was turned back in health insurance.

3174
04:16:09,216 --> 04:16:16,202
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why in this budget, we have looked at those numbers and we've vastly reduced our prediction for what we need for health insurance.

3175
04:16:16,663 --> 04:16:24,349
[SPEAKER_13]: That has allowed us, in part, to actually get away from using one-time funds to fund this budget.

3176
04:16:25,470 --> 04:16:28,813
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm working with what I have.

3177
04:16:32,740 --> 04:16:35,682
[SPEAKER_13]: 2022, the total number of turnbacks was $5.9 million.

3178
04:16:37,443 --> 04:16:37,943
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that.

3179
04:16:43,366 --> 04:16:44,847
[SPEAKER_15]: Is Councilor Tseng-Wook done?

3180
04:16:45,728 --> 04:16:47,889
[SPEAKER_08]: Does that, do you have anything more?

3181
04:16:48,389 --> 04:16:58,775
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I was just gonna suggest that if we have more questions, I mean, as just as future practice, we should email them to administration instead of making it a ruckus over.

3182
04:17:00,387 --> 04:17:02,208
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

3183
04:17:02,428 --> 04:17:04,269
[SPEAKER_32]: Madam President, can you repeat that?

3184
04:17:04,769 --> 04:17:15,415
[SPEAKER_32]: Instead of taking votes as a body, we want us to email... No, you said you want us to email them individually instead of taking votes as a body and raising the issue with the body public?

3185
04:17:17,096 --> 04:17:18,576
[SPEAKER_32]: And not discuss them, yeah?

3186
04:17:18,676 --> 04:17:19,497
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not a motion.

3187
04:17:19,537 --> 04:17:21,078
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't need to interrogate him.

3188
04:17:21,098 --> 04:17:21,678
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scarpelli.

3189
04:17:28,086 --> 04:17:28,646
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Stark.

3190
04:17:28,806 --> 04:17:31,027
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry very, very simple.

3191
04:17:32,407 --> 04:17:44,951
[SPEAKER_16]: I find it that it's in doubt that we have a software that the finance director has concerns with and would presented a budget that I find that it's on a slippery slope right now to make a decision.

3192
04:17:45,691 --> 04:17:52,113
[SPEAKER_16]: I also think that my fellow councils are making a decision because publicly things were promised.

3193
04:17:53,154 --> 04:17:57,295
[SPEAKER_16]: As if we weren't remember when we were promised the city solicitor, we didn't get one.

3194
04:17:58,243 --> 04:18:05,326
[SPEAKER_16]: last year when we were given a city solicitor, and we were given the other options that we sat here for and waited for and we got, we never came through.

3195
04:18:05,346 --> 04:18:19,251
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't want you to forget that I want to make sure it's on the public record that I said that, because the reason why my fellow council said they were in favor of this budget because whatever was whatever was discussed and agreed on.

3196
04:18:20,371 --> 04:18:24,133
[SPEAKER_16]: It's discussed in open, and it's been, it's public.

3197
04:18:24,993 --> 04:18:25,073
[SPEAKER_16]: And

3198
04:18:26,837 --> 04:18:29,019
[SPEAKER_16]: what we've never been lied to before.

3199
04:18:31,702 --> 04:18:40,510
[SPEAKER_16]: And again, the reason why I say this, and I know, listen, we still have questions that still haven't been answered.

3200
04:18:41,271 --> 04:18:45,394
[SPEAKER_16]: I asked for a copy of the consultant

3201
04:18:46,800 --> 04:18:52,946
[SPEAKER_16]: who put the safety of our kids in the high school on the forefront of his report.

3202
04:18:53,806 --> 04:18:55,027
[SPEAKER_16]: I've yet to see that report.

3203
04:18:55,768 --> 04:18:57,049
[SPEAKER_16]: All we know- The Welsh report?

3204
04:18:57,950 --> 04:19:08,479
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, it hasn't been discussed in the budget that even though we haven't, the $900,000 was asked because of the report coming from the school committee, the $900,000 was asked in that report

3205
04:19:12,406 --> 04:19:25,674
[SPEAKER_16]: to make Medford High School safe and efficient moving forward, like the addition of principals, like the addition of more paraprofessionals, like the addition of monitors, like the addition of security systems.

3206
04:19:28,275 --> 04:19:39,802
[SPEAKER_16]: So now we're gonna vote on something without taking that consultant and not honor what they've said and agree that we'll let ESSER funding

3207
04:19:41,076 --> 04:19:46,379
[SPEAKER_16]: fix the deficit that we all so strongly were negatively against because of this factor.

3208
04:19:47,420 --> 04:19:49,681
[SPEAKER_16]: Because all we're doing is pushing this down the road.

3209
04:19:50,762 --> 04:20:01,449
[SPEAKER_16]: And openly, Madam Mayor, Madam President, this looks like, as long as it gets through this budget season, because November is a very important season, that let's not worry about that now.

3210
04:20:01,509 --> 04:20:02,429
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's just get through the season.

3211
04:20:02,449 --> 04:20:03,130
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's get through the vote.

3212
04:20:06,198 --> 04:20:07,058
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what I see.

3213
04:20:07,218 --> 04:20:11,600
[SPEAKER_16]: I just wanted to share that with my fellow Councilors, and I would yield now.

3214
04:20:11,820 --> 04:20:13,720
[SPEAKER_08]: I think- Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

3215
04:20:13,760 --> 04:20:20,862
[SPEAKER_08]: The council did ask the superintendent about enacting what was outlined in the Welch report, and she did say that it was included in the budget.

3216
04:20:21,042 --> 04:20:23,283
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't specifically called out, but she said it was in the budget.

3217
04:20:23,303 --> 04:20:27,724
[SPEAKER_16]: Right, but the report, we want to see the report, because what I will tell you- I didn't get it.

3218
04:20:27,744 --> 04:20:34,566
[SPEAKER_16]: No, but what I will tell you too is when I talked to the teachers that were actually interviewed, they were so impressed

3219
04:20:35,626 --> 04:20:39,387
[SPEAKER_16]: by the consultant and they had they they finally felt like they were listened to.

3220
04:20:40,147 --> 04:20:50,990
[SPEAKER_16]: But after the meeting that I missed on Wednesday, unfortunately, what I found out from some of these teachers that who, by the way, who are now gone, teachers that have been in the system for years who left, they've had enough, they moved on.

3221
04:20:51,230 --> 04:20:52,270
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's speaking freely.

3222
04:20:53,030 --> 04:21:01,372
[SPEAKER_16]: So when they tell me that come September, if these things aren't in place, we're going to be in the same situation of fear

3223
04:21:04,011 --> 04:21:05,351
[SPEAKER_16]: and safety concerns.

3224
04:21:06,132 --> 04:21:07,632
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's what they've shared with me.

3225
04:21:07,672 --> 04:21:19,835
[SPEAKER_16]: I just wanna share that with you because I haven't seen anything about increase in principals and assistant principals, and we're talking about whatever, and if it is done the way it's funded right now, right?

3226
04:21:20,395 --> 04:21:25,357
[SPEAKER_16]: Madam Chief of Staff, the way it's funded, we're looking at $600,000 right off the top next year.

3227
04:21:26,177 --> 04:21:29,418
[SPEAKER_16]: So whatever we're gonna implement, it might be good for a year, but then it's all gone.

3228
04:21:31,659 --> 04:21:33,319
[SPEAKER_16]: And I just don't think that's a sound

3229
04:21:35,024 --> 04:21:37,406
[SPEAKER_16]: fiscal responsible decision we can make.

3230
04:21:37,426 --> 04:21:38,487
[SPEAKER_16]: I just don't think so.

3231
04:21:39,387 --> 04:21:39,908
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you.

3232
04:21:40,068 --> 04:21:40,308
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

3233
04:21:40,348 --> 04:21:42,049
[SPEAKER_08]: The report was sent to the council I can thank you.

3234
04:21:42,089 --> 04:21:43,510
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, if you can, I appreciate it.

3235
04:21:43,530 --> 04:21:45,372
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll go to Vice President Bears.

3236
04:21:46,953 --> 04:21:48,194
[SPEAKER_08]: You had your hand up at some point.

3237
04:21:48,454 --> 04:21:48,734
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

3238
04:21:52,657 --> 04:22:02,126
[SPEAKER_24]: Again, on all of this, like, I think this goes back to what we were talking about at the beginning of this process and what we've talked about with your office, which is like your staffs running around you.

3239
04:22:02,787 --> 04:22:14,218
[SPEAKER_24]: So one of the reasons we wanted that money for budget planning and it's one reason I'm glad we're going to explore it, and what we've discussed because it seems to me there just wasn't enough time to get the right figures into clear gov about actual expenditures.

3240
04:22:15,040 --> 04:22:20,485
[SPEAKER_24]: And that that seems to be the issue or that this clear gov system didn't make it easy enough to do it and it wasn't a priority.

3241
04:22:21,125 --> 04:22:32,995
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think that's created an information gap here where people think one thing and it's not the real numbers because numbers were put out that are not the correct numbers for whatever reason, either capacity or the technology itself.

3242
04:22:33,676 --> 04:22:38,280
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think you know something for me, it would be really good to make sure that

3243
04:22:39,229 --> 04:22:57,530
[SPEAKER_24]: We update the clear gov budgets to have the correct actuals that we have up to date for prior fiscal years for the end of fiscal 23, and then we go into fiscal 24 there's a clear note on there somewhere that says, FY 24 actuals are not complete because the year is not complete yet and we will update them after June 30, because there's this information that went out.

3244
04:22:58,030 --> 04:22:59,671
[SPEAKER_24]: that was not complete and not accurate.

3245
04:22:59,711 --> 04:23:03,615
[SPEAKER_24]: And it's created a disagreement here about what the actual numbers are.

3246
04:23:04,395 --> 04:23:08,279
[SPEAKER_24]: Now, I've gotten other versions of actuals from you guys in different documents.

3247
04:23:08,299 --> 04:23:12,462
[SPEAKER_24]: So I know that's how I knew what was in ClearGov was not the actual actuals.

3248
04:23:12,502 --> 04:23:13,843
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not the actuals from the ACFR.

3249
04:23:13,863 --> 04:23:17,606
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not the actuals from the actual spreadsheets that you've sent over.

3250
04:23:17,686 --> 04:23:22,210
[SPEAKER_24]: So I know ClearGov is not a reliable source for those pieces of information.

3251
04:23:23,771 --> 04:23:52,077
[SPEAKER_24]: So, again, I just think that's something going forward that we wouldn't have had just 3540 minutes of confusion and debate about what the city has actually spent over the last three fiscal years if numbers hadn't been released that were not the correct numbers, and so I just wanted to say that, for the record, on the rest of this I've already made my motion, which is I think we've discussed this, if there are further questions, you know, clearly there was not enough of a supermajority to support the motion and debate but I'm voting on voting.

3252
04:23:53,217 --> 04:23:55,298
[SPEAKER_24]: my concerns about the future are very real.

3253
04:23:55,478 --> 04:24:03,360
[SPEAKER_24]: That's why it's important to me that we're going to have a task force and an improved budget process in the next budget so that we can actually answer these questions.

3254
04:24:03,420 --> 04:24:05,840
[SPEAKER_24]: That's why it's important to me that actual information goes out.

3255
04:24:07,100 --> 04:24:10,581
[SPEAKER_24]: And quite frankly, you know, there's a public commitment here.

3256
04:24:12,002 --> 04:24:12,842
[SPEAKER_24]: And if

3257
04:24:15,208 --> 04:24:20,612
[SPEAKER_24]: If assertions are true that someone wants to go back on that commitment, I'm sure that would be great fodder for the season that is coming up.

3258
04:24:21,453 --> 04:24:25,616
[SPEAKER_24]: Everything that we asked for last- George, everything we asked for- George.

3259
04:24:26,356 --> 04:24:33,241
[SPEAKER_24]: Everything we- Everything we asked for in the last budget is still in the budget.

3260
04:24:34,182 --> 04:24:35,023
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, it is, George.

3261
04:24:36,104 --> 04:24:36,564
[SPEAKER_24]: I agree.

3262
04:24:36,664 --> 04:24:39,987
[SPEAKER_24]: I am very frustrated that the hiring didn't happen.

3263
04:24:40,707 --> 04:24:41,948
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm very frustrated that-

3264
04:24:44,833 --> 04:24:46,034
[SPEAKER_24]: It's all in the budget still.

3265
04:24:46,234 --> 04:24:48,215
[SPEAKER_24]: We never want it.

3266
04:24:48,255 --> 04:24:50,116
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Bears has the floor.

3267
04:24:50,136 --> 04:24:51,857
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, maybe this just- No, no, no.

3268
04:24:51,917 --> 04:24:55,078
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm just saying everything that we got last year is still in the budget.

3269
04:24:56,639 --> 04:24:58,900
[SPEAKER_24]: If you have a solicitor that wants to work here, that's another story.

3270
04:24:59,520 --> 04:24:59,961
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

3271
04:24:59,981 --> 04:25:01,001
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Collins.

3272
04:25:03,122 --> 04:25:03,703
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Collins.

3273
04:25:03,963 --> 04:25:05,343
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Collins.

3274
04:25:06,884 --> 04:25:07,524
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Collins.

3275
04:25:07,725 --> 04:25:08,325
[SPEAKER_08]: She forgot.

3276
04:25:08,345 --> 04:25:10,086
[SPEAKER_10]: She forgot what she wanted to say.

3277
04:25:10,106 --> 04:25:11,266
[SPEAKER_10]: She's been waiting so long.

3278
04:25:11,486 --> 04:25:12,807
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm actually just waiting to be heard.

3279
04:25:13,007 --> 04:25:13,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

3280
04:25:13,628 --> 04:25:14,348
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

3281
04:25:14,701 --> 04:25:15,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

3282
04:25:17,742 --> 04:25:31,947
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I've made it clear that I know how I'm voting, even though this is a very difficult decision, and I think that we have a, I know that not all my fellow councillors feel the same way, and you're entitled to feel derisive of that, and I don't regret you for that.

3283
04:25:32,447 --> 04:25:36,669
[SPEAKER_05]: And I hope you can understand that I'm coming at this from my own sense as well.

3284
04:25:37,669 --> 04:25:41,951
[SPEAKER_05]: And just to reiterate before I motion to approve,

3285
04:25:44,687 --> 04:25:46,267
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, this is a difficult decision.

3286
04:25:47,088 --> 04:25:51,049
[SPEAKER_05]: And when we talk about an individual fiscal year budget, I think it is hard.

3287
04:25:51,449 --> 04:25:56,290
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't not think about all of the budgets after that.

3288
04:25:56,310 --> 04:25:57,831
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard not to think about long-term planning.

3289
04:25:57,891 --> 04:26:09,274
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard for me personally as one constituent and as one councilor to not be overwhelmed by the scale of need for everything that both isn't being funded in this upcoming fiscal year budget and everything that is being planned for five, 10, 25, 50 years after that.

3290
04:26:11,575 --> 04:26:14,436
[SPEAKER_05]: And in order to not be paralyzed by that and to make a decision,

3291
04:26:19,242 --> 04:26:28,051
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to think about what's within my jurisdiction, what can I make sure is in the budget, that we're better off having in the budget than wouldn't be, that isn't possibly on the table to be.

3292
04:26:28,071 --> 04:26:34,677
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's where I'm coming from, zoning, schools, library.

3293
04:26:35,277 --> 04:26:41,023
[SPEAKER_05]: And if there's a way for us to get an edge for a more meaningful participation in the budget process starting next year,

3294
04:26:42,731 --> 04:26:43,952
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's more than we could have gotten.

3295
04:26:43,992 --> 04:26:45,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, am I satisfied?

3296
04:26:46,073 --> 04:26:46,233
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

3297
04:26:46,594 --> 04:26:49,095
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you want to tell a story about me being happy with this outcome, that's fine.

3298
04:26:49,115 --> 04:26:49,696
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a story.

3299
04:26:50,616 --> 04:26:51,677
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's where my vote is coming from.

3300
04:26:52,197 --> 04:26:52,938
[SPEAKER_05]: I motion to approve.

3301
04:26:53,918 --> 04:26:54,239
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

3302
04:26:54,819 --> 04:26:58,562
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Caraviello, we have a motion on the floor from Councilor Collins to approve, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

3303
04:26:58,582 --> 04:26:59,122
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Caraviello.

3304
04:26:59,162 --> 04:26:59,962
[SPEAKER_10]: I have one last question.

3305
04:26:59,982 --> 04:27:07,748
[SPEAKER_10]: So if we knew Clearglove was wrong from day one, why did the mayor come up here and use it in her presentation?

3306
04:27:08,553 --> 04:27:12,563
[SPEAKER_10]: that night when she made her presentation, when you knew it was wrong.

3307
04:27:13,564 --> 04:27:14,164
[SPEAKER_36]: Madam Chair, staff.

3308
04:27:14,225 --> 04:27:15,105
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you, President Morell.

3309
04:27:15,305 --> 04:27:24,372
[SPEAKER_36]: I mean, I haven't had much of an opportunity to really state much as far as this particular resolution is concerned that's been presented by the mayor of this budget.

3310
04:27:25,473 --> 04:27:33,118
[SPEAKER_36]: But I don't believe I stated that this budget is wrong and that we knowingly put a put a wrong budget in front of you.

3311
04:27:33,358 --> 04:27:40,744
[SPEAKER_36]: I think Director Hunt provided a tremendous amount of context to this matter with regard to what occurred in prior years.

3312
04:27:43,626 --> 04:27:49,072
[SPEAKER_10]: So all I'm saying is, why did the mayor, knowing that it was wrong, use it in her presentation?

3313
04:27:50,128 --> 04:27:57,752
[SPEAKER_36]: President Morell, what I was stating is until this evening, I had no knowledge of the information being wrong.

3314
04:27:57,912 --> 04:28:03,195
[SPEAKER_36]: And I, at this point in time, don't have page numbers to direct me to the specific budgets that are specifically wrong.

3315
04:28:03,495 --> 04:28:06,276
[SPEAKER_36]: Now, all I need is the information and we're happy to look into it.

3316
04:28:06,776 --> 04:28:13,980
[SPEAKER_36]: But to be clear, nobody had any information prior to this evening, as far as the administration is concerned or finance, as far as I understand it.

3317
04:28:14,620 --> 04:28:15,301
[SPEAKER_36]: I did not say that.

3318
04:28:16,361 --> 04:28:20,486
[SPEAKER_36]: I don't I don't speak for the finance director president.

3319
04:28:20,506 --> 04:28:21,006
[SPEAKER_13]: He said he knew.

3320
04:28:21,026 --> 04:28:21,207
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

3321
04:28:21,227 --> 04:28:25,631
[SPEAKER_13]: If I may, a lot of the stuff that's in the back end of clear gov.

3322
04:28:35,729 --> 04:28:37,772
[SPEAKER_13]: making these charts, etc.

3323
04:28:37,993 --> 04:28:40,577
[SPEAKER_13]: I knew there was issues with it.

3324
04:28:41,078 --> 04:28:46,526
[SPEAKER_13]: But we needed to get a budget book out because what I'm focused on is the budget for 2024.

3325
04:28:48,109 --> 04:28:49,291
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is a good budget.

3326
04:28:50,472 --> 04:28:56,376
[SPEAKER_13]: We've worked with every single department in the city to tighten everything up.

3327
04:28:56,636 --> 04:29:03,301
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm at my limit of what I can expect on the recap so that we can fund this budget based on our operating revenues.

3328
04:29:04,021 --> 04:29:05,462
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what I was focused on.

3329
04:29:06,203 --> 04:29:13,268
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't say that I know ClearGov's software backwards and forwards, and I can't say that I can, if,

3330
04:29:16,127 --> 04:29:20,409
[SPEAKER_13]: I take a look at the numbers that you're presenting, I can find out where they came from.

3331
04:29:20,569 --> 04:29:24,410
[SPEAKER_13]: And if there are more errors in the back end of ClearGov, I can fix them.

3332
04:29:24,950 --> 04:29:32,493
[SPEAKER_10]: And then- We have 10 days to fix it, and we can vote on the budget after they're fixed.

3333
04:29:32,773 --> 04:29:36,355
[SPEAKER_10]: So we maybe can make a better estimation over voting on it.

3334
04:29:36,515 --> 04:29:39,996
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm looking, if I'm following the numbers, I spent the whole weekend looking at a patent.

3335
04:29:41,820 --> 04:29:47,669
[SPEAKER_10]: of over-budgeting, so I only went on the numbers that you gave me.

3336
04:29:48,611 --> 04:29:54,100
[SPEAKER_10]: You should have put out a disclaimer to everybody saying, hey, those numbers are wrong, don't go by them.

3337
04:29:57,546 --> 04:30:01,108
[SPEAKER_08]: Also just for money you move you move.

3338
04:30:01,268 --> 04:30:04,210
[SPEAKER_32]: It was never shame on you shame on me.

3339
04:30:04,971 --> 04:30:10,014
[SPEAKER_32]: Madam President ultimately right we talked about this is this is a communication issue right more than anything else.

3340
04:30:10,234 --> 04:30:11,115
[SPEAKER_32]: It's a communication issue.

3341
04:30:11,135 --> 04:30:12,876
[SPEAKER_32]: Would everybody agree this is a communication issue.

3342
04:30:13,016 --> 04:30:13,356
[SPEAKER_32]: Absolutely.

3343
04:30:13,576 --> 04:30:13,897
[SPEAKER_32]: Everybody.

3344
04:30:13,917 --> 04:30:15,878
[SPEAKER_32]: So who's responsible for communication from the mayor's office.

3345
04:30:17,853 --> 04:30:20,695
[SPEAKER_32]: Anybody, anybody know who's responsible for the communications from the mayor's office?

3346
04:30:20,975 --> 04:30:21,896
[SPEAKER_32]: Who went from the mayor's office?

3347
04:30:22,136 --> 04:30:22,436
[SPEAKER_32]: Anybody?

3348
04:30:23,236 --> 04:30:24,797
[SPEAKER_32]: No, it's not the communications director.

3349
04:30:25,378 --> 04:30:29,680
[SPEAKER_32]: It's not the COVID specialist, communication specialist or the other two people they got in that office.

3350
04:30:30,361 --> 04:30:40,267
[SPEAKER_32]: According to the city ordinances, there shall be a chief of staff of policy appointed by the mayor whose duty shall include managing communication and information both to and from the office of the mayor.

3351
04:30:42,929 --> 04:30:44,950
[SPEAKER_31]: So we talk about some of the problems that we have in this community.

3352
04:30:47,910 --> 04:30:57,977
[SPEAKER_32]: A lot of it lies in the application of the ordinances and the incumbents interpretation thereof.

3353
04:31:01,380 --> 04:31:11,287
[SPEAKER_32]: So when I sit here and I look at a lot of the problems that happen in this community, and I think about the things we get we get all upset about KP law, one of the biggest things we get upset about right, let's read the city ordinance.

3354
04:31:11,888 --> 04:31:13,129
[SPEAKER_32]: Let's read what the city ordinance says.

3355
04:31:14,150 --> 04:31:21,295
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, about an assistant city solicitor, because the city ordinance says that the mayor may appoint an assistant city solicitor.

3356
04:31:22,856 --> 04:31:26,539
[SPEAKER_32]: Now, can anybody tell me in last year's budget what the assistant city solicitor was?

3357
04:31:26,559 --> 04:31:29,100
[SPEAKER_32]: I believe it was $422,000 was the legal department's budget.

3358
04:31:29,761 --> 04:31:34,964
[SPEAKER_32]: And our city ordinance says that the administration can't spend more than has been appropriated for the department.

3359
04:31:37,086 --> 04:31:39,367
[SPEAKER_31]: But we have correspondence from this administration saying they spent $450,000 on KP law.

3360
04:31:42,452 --> 04:31:45,154
[SPEAKER_31]: which exceeds the 422,000 in the budget.

3361
04:31:47,216 --> 04:31:50,719
[SPEAKER_31]: Whether or not that information is presented to us now as accurate is in question.

3362
04:31:52,501 --> 04:31:59,847
[SPEAKER_31]: But ultimately there's a significant misapplication of the city ordinances in terms of the way that the city is supposed to run.

3363
04:32:00,768 --> 04:32:03,330
[SPEAKER_32]: The first of which being there shall be a city solicitor.

3364
04:32:03,891 --> 04:32:04,531
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, there isn't.

3365
04:32:04,812 --> 04:32:07,394
[SPEAKER_32]: There shall be one, there has to be one, there isn't one.

3366
04:32:10,145 --> 04:32:16,888
[SPEAKER_31]: Then there are controls put in place through city ordinance to prevent wild and uncontrolled spending like what's going on with KP law.

3367
04:32:17,768 --> 04:32:18,668
[SPEAKER_31]: And we don't abide by that either.

3368
04:32:22,630 --> 04:32:31,054
[SPEAKER_31]: But to ensure that we are complying with it, we don't have the financial data before us to allow us to make that determination as to whether or not we're in compliance with our local ordinances.

3369
04:32:35,795 --> 04:32:39,237
[SPEAKER_31]: Last time we raised an issue about an ordinance, the mayor said, well, the city council can just change it.

3370
04:32:40,563 --> 04:32:44,765
[SPEAKER_31]: Last time we raised an issue about process, the chief of staff said, we'll just do it under suspension.

3371
04:32:46,106 --> 04:32:52,168
[SPEAKER_31]: This is the same administration that ran on transparency, the same administration that ran on community.

3372
04:32:55,330 --> 04:33:03,854
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay, so when we sit here yelling and screaming at each other, let's understand, we're not the problem.

3373
04:33:05,074 --> 04:33:07,976
[SPEAKER_31]: Us in this circle behind this rail are not the problem.

3374
04:33:09,121 --> 04:33:09,801
[SPEAKER_31]: You know what we are?

3375
04:33:10,161 --> 04:33:11,002
[SPEAKER_31]: We're frustrated.

3376
04:33:11,342 --> 04:33:12,422
[SPEAKER_31]: You know why we're frustrated?

3377
04:33:12,442 --> 04:33:18,165
[SPEAKER_31]: Because we've been putting a plastic bag and we've been trying to punch our way out for the last two years.

3378
04:33:19,025 --> 04:33:19,625
[SPEAKER_31]: That's why.

3379
04:33:20,466 --> 04:33:23,347
[SPEAKER_31]: So we got Zach and George getting frustrated at each other.

3380
04:33:23,487 --> 04:33:23,747
[SPEAKER_31]: Why?

3381
04:33:23,767 --> 04:33:25,708
[SPEAKER_31]: Because of the administration.

3382
04:33:27,629 --> 04:33:31,330
[SPEAKER_31]: Nicole and I becoming very good friends through this whole entire process.

3383
04:33:31,371 --> 04:33:31,571
[SPEAKER_31]: Why?

3384
04:33:31,591 --> 04:33:34,472
[SPEAKER_31]: Because of the shared concerns and values that we have with the administration.

3385
04:33:37,056 --> 04:33:40,079
[SPEAKER_31]: Doesn't look that way, but that's really what's going on.

3386
04:33:40,300 --> 04:33:42,842
[SPEAKER_31]: That's the fact and the reality behind the situation.

3387
04:33:43,383 --> 04:33:45,825
[SPEAKER_31]: Now, some of us speak a little bit more passionately than others.

3388
04:33:46,406 --> 04:33:48,488
[SPEAKER_31]: Some of us have been around a little bit longer than others.

3389
04:33:48,849 --> 04:33:53,113
[SPEAKER_31]: So some of us have a level of frustration that's a lot higher than other people's.

3390
04:33:53,714 --> 04:33:57,538
[SPEAKER_31]: Some of us have also had the experience of putting up with what I call a BS meter.

3391
04:33:58,499 --> 04:33:59,640
[SPEAKER_31]: We all have a BS meter.

3392
04:33:59,660 --> 04:34:01,202
[SPEAKER_31]: We can all smell it from a mile away.

3393
04:34:01,242 --> 04:34:02,883
[SPEAKER_32]: Some of us are better at smelling it than others.

3394
04:34:03,284 --> 04:34:07,508
[SPEAKER_32]: Some of us allow people to have a little bit more leeway when it comes to wafting their BS around here.

3395
04:34:07,888 --> 04:34:08,969
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm not one of those people.

3396
04:34:09,290 --> 04:34:09,610
[SPEAKER_32]: All right.

3397
04:34:09,690 --> 04:34:12,293
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm not going to sit here and waste my time listening to BS.

3398
04:34:12,673 --> 04:34:13,674
[SPEAKER_32]: That's not what I'm here for.

3399
04:34:14,034 --> 04:34:16,837
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm here to make good decisions on behalf of the taxpayers in this community.

3400
04:34:17,758 --> 04:34:20,621
[SPEAKER_32]: And I can't do that because this administration is fearless.

3401
04:34:21,889 --> 04:34:24,770
[SPEAKER_31]: So we sit here and we infight and we argue and everything else.

3402
04:34:24,830 --> 04:34:26,051
[SPEAKER_31]: We all want the same thing.

3403
04:34:27,071 --> 04:34:33,534
[SPEAKER_31]: We want the respect that we deserve from this administration so that we can do the job that the people in this community elected us to do.

3404
04:34:34,014 --> 04:34:40,457
[SPEAKER_31]: And we can't do it based upon the tools, the resources, the processes, and the procedures that this administration has implemented.

3405
04:34:41,437 --> 04:34:43,878
[SPEAKER_31]: And week in and week out, we express these frustrations.

3406
04:34:43,918 --> 04:34:45,419
[SPEAKER_31]: And week in and week in, we beat our chest.

3407
04:34:46,616 --> 04:34:48,177
[SPEAKER_31]: And week in and week out, nothing changes.

3408
04:34:48,537 --> 04:34:49,638
[SPEAKER_31]: Everything stays the same.

3409
04:34:50,518 --> 04:34:51,459
[SPEAKER_31]: Everything stays the same.

3410
04:34:51,479 --> 04:34:52,699
[SPEAKER_31]: And how do you make things stay the same?

3411
04:34:53,220 --> 04:34:55,021
[SPEAKER_31]: By doing things like divide and conquer.

3412
04:34:55,421 --> 04:34:58,743
[SPEAKER_32]: By doing things like cutting back on deals and making promises you're not gonna keep.

3413
04:35:01,705 --> 04:35:07,348
[SPEAKER_32]: By sending out press releases that control narratives that aren't true, but control the spin because there's no local media in the community.

3414
04:35:09,548 --> 04:35:11,469
[SPEAKER_32]: Those are the realities of the situation.

3415
04:35:11,989 --> 04:35:12,790
[SPEAKER_32]: That's what's going on.

3416
04:35:12,830 --> 04:35:15,271
[SPEAKER_32]: And these are the hurdles that we face as a body.

3417
04:35:15,812 --> 04:35:20,094
[SPEAKER_32]: But for people who are watching this or people that are sitting in the audience saying, Jesus, these people are nuts.

3418
04:35:20,114 --> 04:35:20,954
[SPEAKER_31]: What the hell is going on?

3419
04:35:21,575 --> 04:35:22,776
[SPEAKER_31]: We all want the same thing.

3420
04:35:23,096 --> 04:35:25,117
[SPEAKER_31]: We're just mad because they're not giving it to us.

3421
04:35:26,598 --> 04:35:27,378
[SPEAKER_31]: That's what it is.

3422
04:35:28,499 --> 04:35:32,741
[SPEAKER_31]: Everybody on this side of the rail shares the same value.

3423
04:35:33,261 --> 04:35:34,882
[SPEAKER_31]: They wanna make Medford a better place.

3424
04:35:36,223 --> 04:35:39,025
[SPEAKER_31]: Everyone on this side of the rail has been asking for the tools to do that.

3425
04:35:40,776 --> 04:35:43,578
[SPEAKER_31]: There's only one common denominator and one common thread.

3426
04:35:47,842 --> 04:35:53,486
[SPEAKER_31]: One hurdle, one reason that we haven't been provided with the tools that we need.

3427
04:35:54,127 --> 04:35:55,488
[SPEAKER_31]: And it comes from across the hall.

3428
04:35:56,289 --> 04:35:57,290
[SPEAKER_31]: And let's not forget that.

3429
04:35:57,870 --> 04:36:02,654
[SPEAKER_31]: Because at the end of this meeting, we're all gonna leave, we're all gonna be pissed off at each other and everything else for no reason.

3430
04:36:03,475 --> 04:36:05,256
[SPEAKER_31]: Because this is what the administration wants.

3431
04:36:06,157 --> 04:36:09,520
[SPEAKER_31]: This is the method that they created to divide a wedge between us.

3432
04:36:11,189 --> 04:36:17,795
[SPEAKER_31]: to make it so that this body can't be effective and that they can continue to move with reckless and abandoned and lack of transparency.

3433
04:36:19,096 --> 04:36:20,237
[SPEAKER_31]: And it hurts the taxpayers.

3434
04:36:20,257 --> 04:36:23,100
[SPEAKER_31]: It hurts the residents in this community.

3435
04:36:23,961 --> 04:36:27,344
[SPEAKER_31]: It hurts the process and it makes people distrustful of government.

3436
04:36:28,965 --> 04:36:31,828
[SPEAKER_31]: When people distrust government, they don't participate.

3437
04:36:31,848 --> 04:36:35,872
[SPEAKER_31]: And when people don't participate, then government operates in a vacuum.

3438
04:36:37,176 --> 04:36:41,998
[SPEAKER_31]: We have an administration that already said they throw a third of the voters off of active roles every year.

3439
04:36:43,459 --> 04:36:45,880
[SPEAKER_31]: When you're taking off the active roles, you know what you don't get in the mail?

3440
04:36:47,980 --> 04:36:50,301
[SPEAKER_31]: Literature from candidates that are running from office.

3441
04:36:51,122 --> 04:36:52,202
[SPEAKER_31]: Wow, imagine that.

3442
04:36:52,382 --> 04:36:53,423
[SPEAKER_31]: Now you're misinformed.

3443
04:36:54,023 --> 04:36:57,664
[SPEAKER_31]: You're an inactive voter that's misinformed, but you're expected to come out to the polls and vote.

3444
04:36:59,205 --> 04:37:01,986
[SPEAKER_32]: Let's think about what's going on here, folks, because we're not the problem.

3445
04:37:02,526 --> 04:37:04,087
[SPEAKER_32]: And we sound like we are, and we're not.

3446
04:37:05,868 --> 04:37:06,868
[SPEAKER_32]: We aren't the problem.

3447
04:37:08,579 --> 04:37:09,360
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you, Madam President.

3448
04:37:09,560 --> 04:37:10,560
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

3449
04:37:10,720 --> 04:37:20,025
[SPEAKER_08]: At this point, we have far, far exceeded rule 15, which is councilor so speak no more than three times or 15 minutes on a single topic.

3450
04:37:21,126 --> 04:37:24,048
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, so I do have, yes, so we'll end the motion debate.

3451
04:37:24,128 --> 04:37:25,228
[SPEAKER_08]: I would like to speak briefly.

3452
04:37:27,490 --> 04:37:37,195
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to make it clear that for me, I have made it clear in budget meetings, I told the chief of staff, I think after our first budget meeting, you know, library, schools, zoning.

3453
04:37:39,425 --> 04:37:41,888
[SPEAKER_08]: The mayor met the full request of the library.

3454
04:37:43,469 --> 04:37:48,754
[SPEAKER_08]: They met the schools where they need to be and I've spoken with members of the school committee understanding that they have what they need to execute.

3455
04:37:48,774 --> 04:38:00,945
[SPEAKER_08]: And we got the zoning back in the in the budget, the city solicitor position remains, it's obviously open the assistant city position system city solicitor position remains obviously so open.

3456
04:38:01,425 --> 04:38:02,326
[SPEAKER_08]: These were what matter to me.

3457
04:38:03,700 --> 04:38:05,020
[SPEAKER_08]: in order to be able to pass this budget.

3458
04:38:05,300 --> 04:38:06,461
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it an ideal budget?

3459
04:38:06,881 --> 04:38:07,461
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely not.

3460
04:38:08,201 --> 04:38:10,001
[SPEAKER_08]: Every department needs to be funded far more.

3461
04:38:10,121 --> 04:38:12,882
[SPEAKER_08]: All of our workers need to be paid more, everything.

3462
04:38:13,542 --> 04:38:18,383
[SPEAKER_08]: But we're working with what we have, working with what's presented to me, and I'm voting on the paper before me.

3463
04:38:19,143 --> 04:38:27,265
[SPEAKER_08]: And since day one, again, it has been library, schools, zoning, and making sure that the legal positions in-house were not removed from the budget.

3464
04:38:28,225 --> 04:38:29,806
[SPEAKER_08]: That is why I'm voting in favor of this paper.

3465
04:38:31,192 --> 04:38:34,315
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a motion from Councilor Knight to end all debate.

3466
04:38:34,395 --> 04:38:36,097
[SPEAKER_08]: We also have two members of the public who want to speak.

3467
04:38:36,698 --> 04:38:37,258
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll take those.

3468
04:38:37,278 --> 04:38:38,740
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just going to take them first.

3469
04:38:39,641 --> 04:38:40,722
[SPEAKER_08]: We do have Director O'Connor.

3470
04:38:41,223 --> 04:38:42,344
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll take you first.

3471
04:38:44,026 --> 04:38:46,108
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we'll go to Mr. Castagnetti.

3472
04:38:47,725 --> 04:38:48,706
[SPEAKER_34]: Hi, thank you very much.

3473
04:38:48,846 --> 04:39:05,301
[SPEAKER_34]: I mean, I appreciate that you're coming off of library schools and zoning, considering we're just coming off a pandemic I'm really surprised health isn't included in that but my actual question is, if you do not pass this tonight and I know a lot of your

3474
04:39:06,400 --> 04:39:17,865
[SPEAKER_34]: Yeah, questioning during the budget hearings was, you know, trying to tell us, ask us how understaffed we were and how under-resourced we were.

3475
04:39:18,626 --> 04:39:33,773
[SPEAKER_34]: What exactly would happen if you don't pass this tonight and how much additional work are you then putting on department heads and the departments, considering you were so concerned about how under-resourced we were?

3476
04:39:35,572 --> 04:39:37,153
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Director O'Connor, and I'm sorry.

3477
04:39:37,213 --> 04:39:42,498
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I care about every single budget, and I thank you again and your department for all the work.

3478
04:39:42,898 --> 04:40:02,534
[SPEAKER_08]: It is our understanding, it's my understanding that if this budget were to fail and there were not a budget in place by July 1st, the city has to submit to the Division of Local Services a 112th budget, and all department heads would have to develop a 112th budget to go for July and half of August, because as MGL states,

3479
04:40:03,491 --> 04:40:11,274
[SPEAKER_08]: the mayor, the budget that the mayor submits goes into effect 45 days after it's submitted, regardless of action.

3480
04:40:11,294 --> 04:40:12,675
[SPEAKER_08]: It's my understanding.

3481
04:40:13,555 --> 04:40:18,977
[SPEAKER_36]: We have some minor refinements to that information, but essentially, that's entirely accurate.

3482
04:40:19,298 --> 04:40:25,140
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's information I think we also actually got two years ago from Attorney Scanlon gave us that same information.

3483
04:40:26,361 --> 04:40:32,083
[SPEAKER_41]: So a lot of additional work, I guess would be ridiculously put on the patent heads if this wasn't passed.

3484
04:40:33,806 --> 04:40:35,387
[SPEAKER_08]: That is the understanding.

3485
04:40:35,427 --> 04:40:37,328
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe that's what the mayor is operating under.

3486
04:40:37,428 --> 04:40:37,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

3487
04:40:42,671 --> 04:40:42,991
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

3488
04:40:43,411 --> 04:40:44,072
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have anything else?

3489
04:40:44,292 --> 04:40:44,872
[SPEAKER_08]: Director O'Connor?

3490
04:40:45,612 --> 04:40:45,833
[SPEAKER_34]: No.

3491
04:40:47,373 --> 04:40:47,714
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

3492
04:40:49,455 --> 04:40:50,955
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Collins.

3493
04:40:53,977 --> 04:40:55,158
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, there is a motion on the floor.

3494
04:40:55,318 --> 04:40:59,020
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, there is just yes, there's a motion on the floor from Council Collins to approve second by Councilor Tseng.

3495
04:40:59,830 --> 04:41:00,671

3496
04:41:01,111 --> 04:41:02,512
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, that's Councilor Tsengano earlier.

[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, shocking, absolutely shocking.

3502
04:41:21,803 --> 04:41:25,105
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a bad, sad night in Madford, let me tell you.

3503
04:41:26,078 --> 04:41:30,959
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, Mick Jagger once said, we need leaders, but we get gamblers instead.

[SPEAKER_12]: Good night.

[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

[SPEAKER_08]: So we have a motion from Councilor Collins to approve the budget as presented to us.

[SPEAKER_08]: It's been a long night.

3530
04:43:41,154 --> 04:43:47,215
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we have the $1,600,000 for indirect transfer, which the chief of staff emailed us before the meeting and said it's actually recommended from Director Dickinson not to include this.

3531
04:43:47,235 --> 04:43:49,956
[SPEAKER_08]: So if anyone wants to amend to remove that, and we were given a reason for that.

3536

[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Bears.

3541
04:44:45,344 --> 04:44:46,644
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Madam President.

3542
04:44:47,644 --> 04:44:54,205
[SPEAKER_24]: The communication we got from the chief of staff is actually removing, the mayor's amended to remove the indirect transfer.

3543
04:44:54,225 --> 04:44:56,686
[SPEAKER_24]: So there's, we can't do that, but she has done that.

3544
04:44:57,906 --> 04:45:13,280
[SPEAKER_24]: And I would also move to sever the two votes one to vote on the water and sewer budget and one to vote on the retained earnings transfer promotion advice was embarrassed to sever the two votes to separate the water and sewer budget from the retained earnings transfer second by

3545
04:45:14,321 --> 04:45:16,583
[SPEAKER_32]: So move on a president provided that I could get a question answered.

3546
04:45:17,003 --> 04:45:27,831
[SPEAKER_32]: Historically, historically, the administration has presented us with this $500,000 request after the rates have been established after the budget's been passed and it's been used for rate relief.

3547
04:45:28,792 --> 04:45:35,117
[SPEAKER_32]: Is that going to be the current philosophy behind the expenditure of this plane that's in this paper this evening.

3548
04:45:37,472 --> 04:45:38,773
[SPEAKER_36]: It just to clarify the question.

3549
04:45:40,234 --> 04:45:47,840
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Knight Are you asking if the, I mean at this point in time it's my understanding that the water sewer commission has not taken action on the rates.

3550
04:45:48,300 --> 04:45:57,627
[SPEAKER_36]: I'm not sure if that was your question so I would just phrase it as simply as I could to get to make sure I'm answering your question was asking if this is to offset the cost of consumers counseling.

3551
04:45:57,747 --> 04:46:00,930
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, I mean every year we get a bill of paper for $500,000 that asks us to offset the rates to the.

3552
04:46:04,252 --> 04:46:14,719
[SPEAKER_32]: to the ratepayers for water and sewer through the retained earnings account is this going to be is that's this is this that same 500,000 or is this a different 500,000 or is this something that we're not going to see this year?

3553
04:46:15,240 --> 04:46:16,721
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you, President Morell and Councilor Knight.

3554
04:46:16,761 --> 04:46:19,603
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes, that's the that your understanding Councilor Knight is correct.

3555
04:46:20,924 --> 04:46:21,964
[SPEAKER_32]: So they haven't set the rates yet.

3556
04:46:22,745 --> 04:46:24,306
[SPEAKER_36]: That is my understanding President Morell.

3557
04:46:24,386 --> 04:46:28,949
[SPEAKER_29]: I get $500,000 in rate relief if they do when they do, but we don't know what the rates are going to be.

3558
04:46:29,190 --> 04:46:30,631
[SPEAKER_29]: I think the motion itself would make sense.

3559
04:46:31,380 --> 04:46:36,563
[SPEAKER_08]: So on the motion and vice versa sever the two requests in this resolution seconded by Councilor Knight.

3560
04:46:36,644 --> 04:46:37,244
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

3561
04:46:37,564 --> 04:46:37,744
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

3562
04:46:38,425 --> 04:46:38,885
[SPEAKER_08]: Opposed?

3563
04:46:38,945 --> 04:46:39,706
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion passes.

3564
04:46:39,786 --> 04:46:43,988
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so we will take the entire water sewer budget first, and that is the $28,965,580.75.

3565
04:46:44,049 --> 04:46:45,469
[SPEAKER_08]: President Morell, that's amended by $1.6 million.

3566
04:46:45,529 --> 04:46:45,770
[SPEAKER_08]: As amended.

3567
04:46:45,830 --> 04:46:46,950
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't do the math on the floor.

3568
04:46:46,970 --> 04:46:48,291
[SPEAKER_08]: Not now.

04:46:48,351 --> 04:46:48,932

3575

[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, five in the affirmative, two in the negative, the motion passes.

3576
04:47:31,417 --> 04:47:34,678
[SPEAKER_08]: Do I have a motion on the retained earnings?

3577
04:47:35,138 --> 04:47:35,938
[SPEAKER_23]: Section 22.

3578
04:47:37,859 --> 04:47:38,719
[SPEAKER_08]: You wanna lay it on the table?

3579
04:47:39,519 --> 04:47:40,680
[SPEAKER_23]: First time in financial reading.

3580
04:47:41,460 --> 04:47:43,500
[SPEAKER_23]: Paper can be passed in one evening.

3581
04:47:43,600 --> 04:47:49,642
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a motion from Councilor Knight to invoke section 22 in that the first time a- It's automatic.

3582
04:47:50,182 --> 04:47:52,883
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, great, great, okay, perfect.

3583
04:47:54,704 --> 04:47:59,969
[SPEAKER_08]: So that'll be laid on the table and for one month, three months, one month, next week, next meeting.

3584
04:47:59,989 --> 04:48:18,966
[SPEAKER_08]: So our next meeting, July 11th, going to 22-334 to honorable president members of Morell and members of the city council regarding the fiscal year, 2023 year and transfers to your present rail and members of the city council, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approves the following end of year transfers for FYI, 2023.

3585
04:48:20,802 --> 04:48:34,980
[SPEAKER_08]: transfer to treasurer expenses $40,000 from the reading and get an assessment of the bottom line that I'm present on a motion of Council night to waive the reading and get an assessment on the bottom line seconded by second vices and bears all those in favor.

3586
04:48:35,000 --> 04:48:37,503
[SPEAKER_08]: I suppose motion passes.

3587
04:48:40,061 --> 04:48:42,222
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think we have a bottom line number.

3588
04:48:42,242 --> 04:48:46,043
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you just, Director Dickinson, can you provide us?

3589
04:48:46,083 --> 04:48:55,887
[SPEAKER_32]: We're transferring X amount of dollars from surplus to deficit to balance the budget, I'm sure, is what he's going to say, something along those lines.

3590
04:48:55,967 --> 04:48:57,127
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, can you give us just like the total?

3591
04:48:57,187 --> 04:48:57,787
[SPEAKER_08]: The total is $877,700 from

3592
04:49:04,184 --> 04:49:05,685
[SPEAKER_13]: certain sources to other sources.

3593
04:49:06,305 --> 04:49:09,347
[SPEAKER_32]: So certain accounts run a deficit and certain accounts have a surplus.

3594
04:49:09,367 --> 04:49:13,270
[SPEAKER_32]: And what we're doing is the bottom line remains the same and all we're doing is evening out the accounts.

3595
04:49:13,290 --> 04:49:19,374
[SPEAKER_32]: So that makes accounting easy, but at the end of the day, the bottom line hasn't changed, right?

3596
04:49:19,394 --> 04:49:20,875
[SPEAKER_13]: The bottom line doesn't change.

3597
04:49:24,738 --> 04:49:29,301
[SPEAKER_24]: that's the truck that we discussed during the electrical budget, and that's why it's coming from keep free cash.

3598
04:49:29,321 --> 04:49:30,102
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes Oh, yeah.

3599

[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry.

3601
04:49:31,282 --> 04:49:32,543
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, that is true.

3602
04:49:32,623 --> 04:49:36,465
[SPEAKER_13]: That is that that was a P O. That was inadvertently can't.

3603
04:49:36,505 --> 04:49:39,487
[SPEAKER_13]: It wasn't rolled properly when we closed fiscal 22.

3604
04:49:40,648 --> 04:49:45,551
[SPEAKER_13]: So the money didn't move forward to fit to fiscal 23 fell to free cash, right?

3605
04:49:46,151 --> 04:49:47,752
[SPEAKER_13]: Simply pays for that electric.

[SPEAKER_08]: Do I have a motion?

[SPEAKER_08]: Let's approve on the motion by some bears to approve second by Councilor Collins, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

3611
04:50:19,044 --> 04:50:21,451
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, five in the affirmative, two in the negative motion passes 23-335.

3614
04:50:35,685 --> 04:50:36,366
[SPEAKER_35]: Motion to waive the reading.

3615
04:50:36,646 --> 04:50:39,147
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion of Vice President Bears to waive the reading.

3616
04:50:39,167 --> 04:50:41,508
[SPEAKER_35]: May you refer to the Committee of the Whole.

3617
04:50:41,528 --> 04:50:42,028
[SPEAKER_08]: Just waive the reading.

3618
04:50:42,048 --> 04:50:46,089
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion of Vice President Bears to waive the reading, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

3619
04:50:46,510 --> 04:50:47,090
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

3620
04:50:47,110 --> 04:50:47,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

3621
04:50:47,670 --> 04:50:48,330
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

3622
04:50:48,390 --> 04:50:48,911
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion passes.

3623
04:50:48,951 --> 04:50:50,011
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to refer to the Committee of the Whole.

3624
04:50:51,570 --> 04:50:54,832
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a motion from Councilor Knight refer to the whole second.

3625
04:50:55,453 --> 04:51:02,137
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is a motion from Council night or for the whole.

3626
04:51:02,237 --> 04:51:03,438
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Madam President.

3627
04:51:05,599 --> 04:51:06,760
[SPEAKER_24]: Given where we're at at this point.

3628
04:51:10,589 --> 04:51:25,552
[SPEAKER_24]: basically, once June 30th passes, we're not gonna have access to any of our free cash until DLS certifies free cash, so that could, last year it was all the way till March, so we would not be able to make any appropriations from free cash between July 1st and next March.

3629
04:51:27,032 --> 04:51:35,114
[SPEAKER_24]: Creating a stabilization fund would mean that we would have access to some of our reserve funding in case it is needed for an emergency or for an unexpected use.

3630
04:51:35,754 --> 04:51:38,115
[SPEAKER_24]: I think it would be good to have some availability for that.

3631
04:51:39,710 --> 04:51:41,351
[SPEAKER_24]: and that's what passing this would get us.

3632
04:51:41,531 --> 04:51:41,871
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

3633
04:51:41,891 --> 04:51:43,572
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.

3634
04:51:44,633 --> 04:51:45,954
[SPEAKER_28]: Madam President, thank you very much.

3635
04:51:46,254 --> 04:51:47,755
[SPEAKER_28]: First off, this is a good paper.

3636
04:51:47,795 --> 04:51:49,496
[SPEAKER_28]: It's a paper that I actually filed.

3637
04:51:49,516 --> 04:51:55,719
[SPEAKER_32]: This is a paper that I introduced a number of years ago under the Burke administration, and I'm glad to see that the administration has moved on it.

3638
04:51:56,700 --> 04:51:58,061
[SPEAKER_32]: I'd like to have a committee of the whole paper.

3639
04:51:59,081 --> 04:52:14,290
[SPEAKER_32]: I've seen this community do just fine in previous years without a stabilization fund and to think that if we don't establish this this immediate second and appropriate $5 million into it that the city is going to fail, I think is a little bit more of a

3640
04:52:14,930 --> 04:52:17,611
[SPEAKER_32]: a fear-mongering approach than it is actually the reality of the situation.

3641
04:52:18,652 --> 04:52:23,595
[SPEAKER_32]: So in looking at this, you know, the city's been able to survive for all these years without a stabilization fund.

3642
04:52:23,975 --> 04:52:28,277
[SPEAKER_32]: I think we should sit down and we should talk about it a little bit more and define parameters around the stabilization fund.

3643
04:52:28,557 --> 04:52:44,385
[SPEAKER_32]: I know state law dictates a lot of what we can and can't do, but I think it would be nice to codify that and to establish a process and a procedure very much like the better budget plan that's been put out to amend that charter, Madam President, the procedure and a process that makes it transparent and make sure that everybody knows what to understand and how to understand it.

3644
04:52:46,260 --> 04:52:48,362
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you Councilor Knight for your support for the better budget plan.

3645
04:52:49,483 --> 04:52:50,064
[SPEAKER_24]: Don't get me.

3646
04:52:50,344 --> 04:52:57,412
[SPEAKER_08]: Any further discussion from the council at this point so we have a motion on the floor from Councilor Knight to refer to committee the whole seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

3647
04:53:00,183 --> 04:53:12,472
[SPEAKER_36]: I know this has been stated by vice president bears, but I think it's important for the finance director and myself to be given an opportunity to describe the importance of a stabilization fund.

3648
04:53:13,653 --> 04:53:19,057
[SPEAKER_36]: The vast majority of communities that did that when the paper was introduced the first time we tabled it.

3649
04:53:20,276 --> 04:53:21,996
[SPEAKER_36]: managing staff continue.

3650
04:53:22,336 --> 04:53:36,280
[SPEAKER_36]: So, so it's important I think that the city council understands and I just want to reinforce what Vice President Bears said he stated it properly, we terminate our ability to access what cities and towns calls rainy day funds.

3651
04:53:36,860 --> 04:53:39,760
[SPEAKER_36]: Once June 30 passes, we will not have access to those funds.

3652
04:53:40,721 --> 04:53:45,962
[SPEAKER_36]: If there was ever a major catastrophic issue that the city faced that would not be able to be addressed.

3653
04:53:46,562 --> 04:53:50,244
[SPEAKER_36]: You know, I understand that these types of matters take time.

3654
04:53:50,344 --> 04:53:52,306
[SPEAKER_36]: That's why we submitted this paper back in February.

3655
04:53:52,426 --> 04:53:53,967
[SPEAKER_36]: We've resubmitted this paper this evening.

3656
04:53:54,367 --> 04:54:01,231
[SPEAKER_36]: I encourage you to vote on this, and I, with your willingness, Madam President, defer to the finance director in the event he has additional remarks.

3657
04:54:01,451 --> 04:54:01,732
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.

3658
04:54:02,012 --> 04:54:02,232
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

3659
04:54:04,304 --> 04:54:14,192
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just quite simply, this has been asked for over and over again by our auditors and by our bond council to maintain our double A plus rating.

3660
04:54:15,473 --> 04:54:19,536
[SPEAKER_13]: Simply, there is a procedure for using these funds.

3661
04:54:19,636 --> 04:54:23,419
[SPEAKER_13]: It has to go to the city council to be voted on if we use these funds.

3662
04:54:24,580 --> 04:54:24,800
[SPEAKER_13]: that.

3663
04:54:25,861 --> 04:54:29,083
[SPEAKER_13]: As chief of staff has stated June 30th.

3664
04:54:29,543 --> 04:54:30,344
[SPEAKER_13]: No free cash.

3665
04:54:30,384 --> 04:54:35,587
[SPEAKER_13]: If something happens before deal us proves for cash for 2023.

3666
04:54:36,647 --> 04:54:39,389
[SPEAKER_13]: There's there's no pot of money we can go to to.

3667
04:54:39,409 --> 04:54:43,251
[SPEAKER_13]: Um fund something in an emergency.

3668
04:54:43,571 --> 04:54:47,414
[SPEAKER_13]: So that is why we're simply taking free cash, and we're

3669
04:54:52,199 --> 04:54:53,660
[SPEAKER_13]: by a vote of the city council.

3670
04:54:55,441 --> 04:55:02,965
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a majority vote majority super majority of the city council so we can use it to fund an emergency situation.

3671
04:55:04,086 --> 04:55:04,846
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

3672
04:55:06,407 --> 04:55:09,348
[SPEAKER_28]: Sounds like it's a pretty big deal, Madam President, and it's 5 million bucks.

3673
04:55:11,129 --> 04:55:12,110
[SPEAKER_28]: We're not gonna have a meeting on it.

3674
04:55:13,783 --> 04:55:16,485
[SPEAKER_32]: been recommended by auditors, been recommended by bond council.

3675
04:55:16,985 --> 04:55:23,110
[SPEAKER_32]: It's necessary for us to keep our A plus rating and it's a $5 million appropriation and we're not gonna have a meeting on it.

3676
04:55:26,812 --> 04:55:27,493
[SPEAKER_08]: Questions and bears.

3677
04:55:28,954 --> 04:55:35,558
[SPEAKER_24]: Would quite frankly, that was my argument when it was first proposed.

3678
04:55:36,639 --> 04:55:37,920
[SPEAKER_24]: So fair argument.

3679
04:55:38,920 --> 04:55:47,224
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, would folks consider holding a committee of the whole next week and considering moving on this before June 30th so that we could access the free cash funds after we've had a meeting.

3680
04:55:52,426 --> 04:55:59,029
[SPEAKER_29]: You're making it sound like they're going to be able to get bond council there at the auditor there and everybody else there in 10 days notice and I don't see that happening.

3681
04:56:00,461 --> 04:56:11,103
[SPEAKER_24]: that's something that you guys could commit to having the necessary parties there to make answer all of our questions so that we could potentially schedule a committee of the whole to discuss it and also potentially a special meeting to approve it.

3682
04:56:11,889 --> 04:56:26,635
[SPEAKER_36]: President Morell, through you, notwithstanding other individuals' availability, we're happy to arrange as many parties that can attend, and I believe Councilor Knight said the financial city's financial advisor, the city's auditor, and if there are others that I missed.

3683
04:56:26,655 --> 04:56:27,275
[SPEAKER_32]: Bond Council.

3684
04:56:27,295 --> 04:56:28,255
[SPEAKER_36]: Bond Council, certainly.

3685
04:56:28,855 --> 04:56:31,817
[SPEAKER_36]: Notwithstanding their schedules, we're happy to attempt to arrange it, certainly.

3686
04:56:32,357 --> 04:56:38,119
[SPEAKER_32]: And ultimately, is there anything that precludes this community from bringing this paper forward between now and March?

3687
04:56:41,897 --> 04:56:47,661
[SPEAKER_32]: while our free cash is being certified, knowing that we have more than $5 million in our free cash already.

3688
04:56:48,642 --> 04:56:53,986
[SPEAKER_32]: What precludes us from creating this in 90 days or 60 days, but before March?

3689
04:56:54,086 --> 04:56:54,727
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm just asking.

3690
04:56:54,767 --> 04:57:10,639
[SPEAKER_36]: President Morell, there's no scenario where this is created in 90 days, because again, free cash for FY, what would be FY 22, would have to be certified, which means the full auditing, the full closure of the, I don't want to say auditing, that's probably not the right term, but- The account can be set up, it just doesn't have to be funded with 5 million bucks.

3691
04:57:10,999 --> 04:57:13,560
[SPEAKER_36]: Let me be very clear, and I defer to Director Dickinson.

3692
04:57:13,640 --> 04:57:18,901
[SPEAKER_36]: There is no way to spend any free cash until it's certified each fiscal year.

3693
04:57:19,661 --> 04:57:20,262
[SPEAKER_36]: That is the law.

3694
04:57:21,882 --> 04:57:27,724
[SPEAKER_13]: To clarify, the $25 million in free cash that we have right now is the $25 million from the end of fiscal 2022.

3695
04:57:27,764 --> 04:57:29,684
[SPEAKER_13]: It expires on June 30th.

3696
04:57:41,266 --> 04:57:50,091
[SPEAKER_13]: It's gone until we file for 2023 free cash with the Department of- It's not gone, it's there.

3697
04:57:50,111 --> 04:57:51,492
[SPEAKER_29]: It just needs to be recertified, right?

3698
04:57:51,512 --> 04:57:52,193
[SPEAKER_24]: It can't be accessed.

3699
04:57:52,253 --> 04:57:52,813
[SPEAKER_13]: It has to be, yes.

3700
04:57:52,833 --> 04:57:53,794
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not going away.

3701
04:57:54,074 --> 04:57:56,475
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not like we're losing 22 million bucks on something off the table.

3702
04:57:56,535 --> 04:57:59,617
[SPEAKER_13]: No, we're just not, we're not throwing it in a garbage can or something like that.

3703
04:57:59,737 --> 04:58:08,142
[SPEAKER_13]: It stays, but we can't access those funds until we get DLS to certify 2023 free cash.

3704
04:58:08,763 --> 04:58:10,744
[SPEAKER_32]: We just passed like a $200 million budget, didn't we?

3705
04:58:11,829 --> 04:58:23,918
[SPEAKER_13]: So we cannot vote to use free cash to establish a stabilization fund after June 30th, unless we've got DLS.

3706
04:58:24,939 --> 04:58:30,764
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes, which- We can establish a stabilization fund and not fund it, and then wait for the free cash to be certified, right?

3707
04:58:31,781 --> 04:58:32,882
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe that's correct.

3708
04:58:32,982 --> 04:58:40,246
[SPEAKER_32]: We could go through a legislative process and create actual legislation instead of doing this at the 11th hour and making a $5 million appropriation on it.

3709
04:58:40,947 --> 04:58:43,528
[SPEAKER_32]: You know, I think we're putting the horse behind the car.

3710
04:58:43,748 --> 04:58:44,309
[SPEAKER_32]: You know what I mean?

3711
04:58:44,369 --> 04:58:49,092
[SPEAKER_32]: It's like, if we're going to create a process, let's create the process and let's go through the legislative process and create it.

3712
04:58:49,492 --> 04:58:52,994
[SPEAKER_32]: Let's not throw $5 million into an account and then say figure the rest of that out later.

3713
04:58:53,214 --> 04:58:54,095
[SPEAKER_30]: That doesn't make sense to me.

3714
04:58:59,094 --> 04:59:01,158
[SPEAKER_32]: It's like we're creating it and funding it in the same day.

3715
04:59:01,338 --> 04:59:02,180
[SPEAKER_32]: Why don't we create it?

3716
04:59:03,462 --> 04:59:07,650
[SPEAKER_30]: Establish the procedures and protocols for drawing funds out of it and the like, and then fund it.

3717
04:59:10,336 --> 04:59:18,098
[SPEAKER_36]: Madam President, just certainly, whatever the will of the council is, it would take a super majority to create this, the stabilization fund.

3718
04:59:18,278 --> 04:59:23,020
[SPEAKER_36]: So whatever the will of the city council is, the only thing I will add here for information.

3719
04:59:23,040 --> 04:59:25,641
[SPEAKER_28]: Does it take a super majority to create it or a super majority to withdraw from it?

3720
04:59:26,201 --> 04:59:26,621
[SPEAKER_28]: Both.

3721
04:59:26,741 --> 04:59:29,222
[SPEAKER_36]: Both create it and withdraw it, but not put funds into it.

3722
04:59:29,262 --> 04:59:31,022
[SPEAKER_36]: It only takes a majority to put funds into it.

3723
04:59:32,683 --> 04:59:39,305
[SPEAKER_36]: The only point I wanted to make in addition here is that there are many communities that establish a fund and then they fund it immediately.

3724
04:59:39,665 --> 04:59:47,772
[SPEAKER_36]: Sometimes that funding is not large sometimes that funding is large, the city council could fund up to $5 million this evening, it could choose not to as well.

3725
04:59:48,472 --> 04:59:52,996
[SPEAKER_36]: That this this paper has been before the city council, as of February, the council referred it.

3726
04:59:53,637 --> 04:59:55,718
[SPEAKER_36]: I didn't find any actual discussions in committee.

3727
04:59:56,159 --> 05:00:03,645
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm not sure what to say beyond that we've been on the floor for that amount of committee papers still in the paper now the paper is disposed of by being voted into committee.

3728
05:00:06,035 --> 05:00:11,895
[SPEAKER_10]: There's many accounts that they can borrow the money from and replenish it when the free cash is certified.

3729
05:00:14,214 --> 05:00:23,822
[SPEAKER_36]: My only question to the city Councilors who are objecting to this matter is, what do we do between the time in which free cash becomes unavailable and free cash becomes available.

3730
05:00:24,102 --> 05:00:25,383
[SPEAKER_36]: If there is a catastrophic issue.

3731
05:00:26,103 --> 05:00:36,552
[SPEAKER_36]: I just want you to know the information for that for that crystal ball to be able to tell you when a catastrophic issues going to occur and I'm just trying to assist the community in planning for those issues.

3732
05:00:36,592 --> 05:00:36,872
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.

3733
05:00:39,991 --> 05:00:40,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, President real.

3734
05:00:42,032 --> 05:00:53,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to add my perspective on this, I'm ready to get this done tonight I sense that they're my fellow Councilors, we don't, we don't have a super majority that's ready to get this done tonight.

3735
05:00:53,762 --> 05:00:57,766
[SPEAKER_05]: But my reasoning is, you know,

3736
05:00:58,889 --> 05:01:00,830
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that the idea of a stabilization fund is a good one.

3737
05:01:00,850 --> 05:01:02,111
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that we probably all share that.

3738
05:01:02,131 --> 05:01:03,472
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think that's a minority opinion.

3739
05:01:04,253 --> 05:01:10,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Looking back at the past few years and thinking ahead to do we want this online for fiscal year 24 or not, past few years, we haven't been fine.

3740
05:01:11,097 --> 05:01:11,737
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't been fine.

3741
05:01:11,757 --> 05:01:12,518
[SPEAKER_05]: We've had a pandemic.

3742
05:01:13,118 --> 05:01:14,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Ask residents, we haven't been fine.

3743
05:01:15,460 --> 05:01:18,261
[SPEAKER_05]: What's different about next year is all this one-time funding is going away.

3744
05:01:18,321 --> 05:01:20,223
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I think something catastrophic is going to happen?

3745
05:01:20,843 --> 05:01:25,086
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but if it did, I'd want to know that we did what we could to prepare.

3746
05:01:25,926 --> 05:01:28,729
[SPEAKER_05]: So we don't have to do it tonight.

3747
05:01:29,090 --> 05:01:31,072
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we should do it by the end of this fiscal year.

3748
05:01:31,092 --> 05:01:38,759
[SPEAKER_05]: If that means arranging for a committee of the whole on a special meeting next week, I'll make myself available, but I think that we should do it before the end of the fiscal year.

3749
05:01:39,300 --> 05:01:40,781
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have had several months to think about this.

3750
05:01:41,482 --> 05:01:41,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

3751
05:01:44,905 --> 05:01:50,049
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I don't want to extend this matter too long but I concur with Councilor Collins.

3752
05:01:50,569 --> 05:02:03,538
[SPEAKER_07]: I think, you know, I think about what ifs, and it's important that we have a fund that we are able to kind of draw funds from in case something catastrophic or really horrific emergency does happen, God forbid.

3753
05:02:06,660 --> 05:02:10,962
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we I think on the council we come up with a lot of great ideas about how to spend free cash.

3754
05:02:11,642 --> 05:02:15,664
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I know, Councilor Caraviello posted a bunch actually on Facebook that are really good.

3755
05:02:16,324 --> 05:02:27,508
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and I think this things like this, maybe we don't we were not able to spend on everything that we want, but I think being able to take from free cash is really important.

3756
05:02:27,588 --> 05:02:29,009
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I would support this.

3757
05:02:29,369 --> 05:02:33,431
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't have to move forward tonight, but I really, really would want this to pass before June 30th.

3758
05:02:34,855 --> 05:02:35,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

3759
05:02:36,696 --> 05:02:37,937
[SPEAKER_08]: Any further discussion from the council?

3760
05:02:38,817 --> 05:02:39,477
[SPEAKER_07]: Move the question.

3761
05:02:39,497 --> 05:02:46,621
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a motion from Councilor Knight to send the paper to Committee of the Whole, which we have to schedule with all due urgency.
