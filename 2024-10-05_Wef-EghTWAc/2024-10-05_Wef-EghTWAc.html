<a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=372.378s">So</a>  now it's gone, her title is gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=375.9s">She</a>  has gotten a obviously a promotion with her new title. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=382.363s">And</a>  I also noticed that there's only one other <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=387.006s">there's</a>  one clerk position missing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=389.028s">There</a>  was supposed to be a senior clerk, a principal clerk, and the office manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=396.635s">Right</a>  now, when I went through all of these, there's one head clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=402.301s">And</a>  I think that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=405.788s">So</a>  what happened to these union positions? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=407.93s">How</a>  is this allowed time and time again? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=411.073s">Can</a>  anybody answer me? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=412.034s">Can</a>  anybody look me in the eye and tell me that- These are mandatory topics of bargaining, correct?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=416.638s">Excuse</a>  me? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=417.098s">These</a>  are mandatory topics of bargaining, correct?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=420.301s">Yeah,</a>  so you guys should be taking care of this at the table.</p>

    <p>[Tenaglia]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=423.041s">No,</a>  we don't even know about this until we see this paperwork. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=426.842s">I</a>  didn't know any of this was going on.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=428.862s">You</a>  guys need to enact your rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=431.343s">I</a>  mean, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=432.703s">You</a>  have rights under the- I don't get it, though.</p>

    <p>[Tenaglia]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=435.083s">You</a>  people are supposed to be for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=437.184s">What</a>  is going on?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=438.164s">Amy,</a>  time out here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=438.944s">Time</a>  out here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=439.444s">We're</a>  not the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=440.264s">We</a>  don't negotiate contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=441.344s">That's</a>  the job of the chief of staff per ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=443.605s">All</a>  right, now, I haven't seen the chief of staff in a contract negotiation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=446.105s">That's</a>  a whole different story. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=446.985s">We</a>  have KP Law doing that.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=448.466s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=450.606s">I</a>  think what Amy's talking about is these positions were all voted by members of this council, not unanimously, but it was voted by members of this group. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=458.235s">That's</a>  what she's saying.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=459.096s">Yeah,</a>  I agree with you there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=461.059s">But</a>  these are mandatory topics of bargaining. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=462.741s">So</a>  when the administration is, you know, depleting the number of membership, the number of <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=470.754s">employees</a>  that are in the membership, you have to look at the work that's being performed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=473.696s">And</a>  if the work that's being performed by an employee that's actually union workers, not in the union, they didn't bring the city up on charges. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=479.52s">You</a>  know, we've seen time and time again in this community, the level of respect that's given to organized labor by this administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=486.024s">All</a>  right, and it's lacking, it's lacking and never before and I mean, I've worked in local government now for <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=491.727s">Shoot,</a>  since 1999, I represented union workers all across the Commonwealth from Worcester County to Springfield and back, all right, state, local. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=499.971s">And</a>  I've never seen anything like this before, where employees are treated like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=503.693s">And,</a>  you know, I just, <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=507.367s">I'm</a>  afraid for you for being up here right now, tonight and speaking out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=510.528s">I'm</a>  afraid for you right now from being up here and speaking out tonight.</p>

    <p>[Tenaglia]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=513.13s">I</a>  could be afraid for myself also. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=515.391s">But</a>  there comes a point where everybody just has to do what is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=521.013s">Don't</a>  go for your own agendas. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=522.814s">Do</a>  what is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=523.794s">And</a>  I don't I don't understand it.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=526.515s">And</a>  the reason I say I'm scared for you right now is because I could go down a list of people <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=530.78s">have</a>  got they've gotten rid of come up here to this microphone and they've spoken out against some injustice, the councils agree with them, and those people are gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=537.443s">So</a>  we look at Brian Karen's Mike for ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=540.004s">Mike</a>  Durham, Alicia Nunley, Molly kibbe. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=543.146s">That's</a>  five people, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=544.386s">That's</a>  five people, five people with families, five people who need health insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=549.429s">Five</a>  people that committed to work for this community that came up here and spoke on behalf of the people and the taxpayers and the world let go. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=555.441s">I</a>  applaud you for your courage, Amy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=556.682s">I</a>  do applaud you for the courage that you have for coming up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=558.924s">I</a>  think a lot of this stuff really is mandatory topics of bargaining and mandatory topics of negotiation that need to be addressed at the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=564.368s">I</a>  agree with you that the actions of this body and the vote that some people take, given these people raises, there's no question about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=569.812s">The</a>  council needs to fund this, the mayor needs to propose it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=571.714s">And</a>  the mayor did propose a significant pay hike for a number of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=575.617s">What's</a>  the number councilor Bears? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=576.698s">I</a>  believe it was 16 requests have been made so far for reclassification of positions and the council is- 18, we rejected 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=583.543s">18,</a>  we rejected 16.</p>

    <p>[Tenaglia]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=586.526s">When</a>  nobody listens to you in the negotiations, and your hands are tied, and you have nobody else to go to, this is my go-to right here.</p>

    <p>[Tenaglia]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=830.444s">What</a>  I've also realized, besides that paperwork that I gave you, I looked on the agenda tonight, and I also noticed that she put out an amended budget for this year, it was put out on June 14. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=846.673s">She</a>  is asking for a lot more in salaries than what I read off to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=851.577s">So</a>  people, the assessor's office and salaries, they're asking for more than $37,000 extra. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=858.061s">I</a>  mean, the election committee, now they're putting part time, they're making one position supposedly part time, which they shouldn't be able to do, but they're asking for another $103,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=871.169s">salaries?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=871.71s">How</a>  was that? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=872.41s">How</a>  was that even possible? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=874.372s">How?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=875.232s">I</a>  don't know how people can allow this to go on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=879.976s">You</a>  know, I can, can people can somebody tell me something? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=882.578s">Can</a>  somebody like at least respond? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=884.52s">Can</a>  somebody tell me that this is not okay, but actually back up their words? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=892.226s">You</a>  know, everybody here is telling me that all we're behind you, you know, go out and do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=897.15s">We'll</a>  be right behind you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=899.012s">And</a>  then I hear <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=900.626s">that</a>  there's a backroom deal that this is all set already. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=904.689s">So</a>  all of my words and all of everything that we've tried to explain to you, person to person, not even not even counselor to employee, just as human beings. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=916.756s">Does</a>  everybody understand that once this budget is passed, all these people that are already making so much money are getting good raises, and me, who's making what, $56,000? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=930.054s">I</a>  can't afford it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=932.096s">Somebody</a>  has to do something.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=934.246s">Well,</a>  Amy, I think that's inaccurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=937.41s">The</a>  raises that have been, the raises that you're referring to have already been passed and they've already been funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=942.457s">So</a>  regardless of whether or not this budget passed, these pay scales established by ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=947.731s">everything</a>  except for I think Mary's position, the one that you referred to, because that hasn't been passed by ordinance and the human resources position that they keep ignoring us on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=955.795s">But</a>  ultimately, these classifications for non-union titles and the cost of living adjustment that's attached there too, was passed by this body, not unanimously, but it was passed by this body and it was funded by this body.</p>

    <p>[Tenaglia]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=968.0s">So</a>  everybody, wait a second, everybody's entitled to a cost of living increase, except for, we're not even at the minimum level here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=977.167s">We're</a>  below, we're almost at poverty level here, people.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=981.371s">Right,</a>  but you have the power to negotiate in these non-union policies.</p>

    <p>[Tenaglia]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=983.712s">We</a>  have no power, do you understand what it's like? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=986.094s">Well,</a>  we did ask and you guys weren't allowed to come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=988.836s">It's</a>  like talking to a wall. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=991.238s">It's</a>  like, it's better to go get a wall, bang your head against it, and maybe you'll get something done. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=997.723s">But</a>  I'm sure everybody here that's going to pass the budget got exactly what they wanted right everybody's going to get what they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1005.169s">But</a>  let's see if it really goes through.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1007.591s">So</a>  just a question so the negotiations between the clerical union and the administration I'm going well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1014.966s">Really,</a>  no, I'm just thinking back to when the mayor put her budget presentation on opening night, and she said how great negotiations are going with all the negotiations and how close they were to settle.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1024.232s">I'm</a>  not happening.</p>

<a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1036.562s">Everybody</a>  wants to talk about supporting the union. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1039.463s">It</a>  sounds good, it looks good on your paraphernalia you're gonna mail out that you're supported or you're whatever for this, but I want you to realize, and I want my fellow councils to realize, this is something I've been saying from the beginning, any money paper that's come, unless it was urgent, I voted no. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1058.213s">Any</a>  vote for raises for non-union employees, I voted no. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1062.617s">I</a>  implored, I expressed that to my fellow counselors and they passed, unfortunately. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1068.919s">I</a>  voted no. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1070.06s">What</a>  I will tell you is the other issue that I see, it's pretty damaging. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1074.721s">When</a>  you look behind you, I don't see one male. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1078.102s">I</a>  don't see one male employee that hasn't got when they need it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1082.744s">And</a>  I know this council in the past have talked about the rights of women and making sure there's equality here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1088.735s">And</a>  I don't see that either. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1090.636s">So</a>  here's the thing, I'm not afraid either. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1092.536s">I</a>  lived in this community my whole life. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1095.617s">I've</a>  been an elected official since I left teaching in 2008. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1100.959s">I'm</a>  not afraid to say what I have to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1103.66s">But</a>  what I'm sad for you is you're being used as a pawn. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1108.421s">Unions</a>  are being used as a pawn, whether it's the lieutenant governor, whether it's the governor's office, whether it's state representatives or whether it's this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1117.788s">So</a>  what can I tell you? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1119.149s">I</a>  can't tell you anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1120.61s">You're</a>  going through horrible negotiations because nobody is standing up for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1124.674s">This</a>  is the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1125.614s">Right</a>  now, I thought today, when I came here, I said, well, this is the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1130.318s">We've</a>  talked about a council that have worked together pretty closely in the past year, making sure good initiatives get passed, even without any of the tools that were promised us last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1141.038s">So</a>  this is the time, when we vote later, you're going to realize where you should focus on, where the city should focus on, where unions should focus on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1151.602s">Because</a>  I'll be honest with you, if you keep giving and you keep giving, what is she gonna do? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1158.505s">She's</a>  gonna keep taking. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1159.466s">Until</a>  what? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1161.086s">You</a>  say stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1163.147s">Last</a>  year we said stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1165.988s">And</a>  at least we were heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1169.29s">At</a>  least we were heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1171.834s">With</a>  the presentation later with the budget, I know Councilor Caraviello has worked extensively in putting some numbers together, that when I think that people hear it, and if anybody would vote for this budget after you hear these numbers, it'll be appalling for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1187.829s">So</a>  what I could tell you and your fellow colleagues that are getting the short end of the stick again, <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1195.051s">is</a>  all I could do is apologize from one city councilor to one department in the city that keeps us running every single day. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1201.874s">I</a>  apologize that you haven't even have to go through this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1204.956s">This</a>  is a disgrace. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1207.357s">This</a>  is sad for me.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1236.9s">For</a>  a point of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1237.88s">This</a>  vote was early. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1239.001s">This</a>  was I mean, you're absolutely entails you feel like this vote was prior to you coming before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1244.143s">This</a>  vote was prior to what prior to you coming before us to speak at public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1249.107s">This</a>  vote was- I've spoken months ago too. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1251.708s">Okay,</a>  but I just want to make clear if it wasn't the most recent one.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1257.85s">I'm</a>  not, I stand by my vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1258.971s">It</a>  was a 2% raise over three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1260.892s">It</a>  was 2%, 2%, 2%. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1261.872s">This</a>  is 2%? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1262.812s">It</a>  compounds.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1264.053s">No</a>  it wasn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1264.853s">It</a>  was four.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1265.473s">What</a>  we voted for was 2%. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1267.054s">Oh</a>  my God. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1268.214s">Look</a>  at the numbers.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1269.475s">It</a>  compounds, it's compound interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1271.175s">That's</a>  why it's more than 6%.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1272.176s">You</a>  wouldn't know what compound is because you weren't given a raise for six years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1275.117s">So</a>  that actually explained to you later. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1276.758s">You</a>  wouldn't know that, I'm sorry.</p>

    <p>[Tenaglia]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1278.078s">You</a>  talk about giving the other people cost of living increases. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1282.34s">Bring</a>  their salaries up so they can survive. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1284.741s">Where's</a>  my cost of living increase?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1286.282s">Amy,</a>  the council did also in that proposal that was given to us, the mayor didn't tell us what classifications were included in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1291.865s">And</a>  then when we did an investigation and we looked into it, we found that the executive was included in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1297.187s">The</a>  mayor proposed a raise for herself in that proposal and we cut that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1301.109s">And</a>  the mayor had also proposed a raise for the council and we cut that raise out as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1305.071s">You</a>  know what I mean, to stand by what we've said that you know what I mean, rising tide floats all ships and we think that you guys should go so...</p>

    <p>[Tenaglia]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1311.0s">you</a>  think department heads that started six months ago, three months ago, whatever deserved a raise that they got. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1318.358s">They</a>  haven't even been here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1320.407s">For</a>  a year, yes? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1322.228s">I've</a>  been here 23 years.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1324.408s">Again,</a>  these are cost of living adjustments. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1325.889s">They're</a>  not performance-based.</p>

    <p>[Tenaglia]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1327.289s">I</a>  need a cost of living adjustment.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1329.049s">Right,</a>  but you're in a union, so you gotta negotiate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1331.43s">They</a>  don't, you know, you have a collective bargaining.</p>

    <p>[Tenaglia]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1333.111s">Not</a>  once has the mayor come in for a negotiation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1335.511s">Not</a>  once has she said to us, I think this is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1339.532s">Let</a>  me talk to you people. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1341.513s">Not</a>  once. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1343.493s">You</a>  know, and all of you look like deer in headlights here, but you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1346.694s">You're</a>  all getting everything you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1349.748s">And</a>  I got to go back every time I see a job posting in little little print at the bottom, it says that everything, all the job description, it's, it can include more than what is listed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1362.354s">So</a>  in other words, I can tell you that I'm doing this and this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1365.736s">But</a>  at the end, if they asked me to do even more, that's part of my job description, though it wasn't written there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1371.679s">So</a>  when when do I stop? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1373.46s">I</a>  do the budget for the department. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1375.821s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1376.661s">I</a>  did for <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1378.902s">20</a>  years, I did facilities, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1382.203s">Now</a>  they got a whole new person, which is fine by me, because it's not worth the aggravation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1387.284s">But</a>  all this extra work that I personally did because I love this city, and I liked my job is nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1394.845s">It's</a>  all gone.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1395.545s">Yes,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Tenaglia]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1398.405s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1401.006s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1408.504s">I</a>  feel for every one of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1410.565s">I</a>  was one of the ones that did not support the non-union vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1413.485s">And</a>  not that the non-union people do not deserve a raise, they deserve a raise just like everyone else does. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1420.047s">But</a>  I come from a culture where these are the people that make the city run. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1426.749s">And</a>  you're the ones that make the department heads look good. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1430.11s">Bosses</a>  should never, ever, ever get a raise before their employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1435.071s">The</a>  city is similar to a business. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1437.864s">Your</a>  raise should be similar to the teacher's raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1440.505s">Everybody</a>  in the city should all get the same raise across the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1443.847s">What</a>  makes your job any less important than the teacher's? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1446.729s">What</a>  makes your job any less important than the fireman or the policeman or anybody else who works in this city? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1452.532s">We</a>  all work for the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1453.753s">We</a>  all work at the same common goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1455.714s">This</a>  is not, we're gonna pick and choose who we get raises, but this is how this group work. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1460.176s">We</a>  pick and choose who gets raises, who gets how much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1464.167s">Teachers</a>  went out there and picketed forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1466.289s">Maybe</a>  you women should get out there and picket in front, like the teachers did.</p>

    <p>[Tenaglia]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1469.631s">Oh,</a>  well, we did that and it didn't end up well.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1472.093s">It</a>  didn't end up well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1473.574s">But</a>  again, everybody should be getting the same rates here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1476.877s">Different</a>  departments shouldn't get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1478.718s">You're</a>  all essential workers here.</p>

    <p>[Tenaglia]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1480.599s">Yes,</a>  and I understand- All work during COVID.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1483.652s">when</a>  you just bought $4,500 to know that.</p>

    <p>[Tenaglia]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1486.893s">Yes,</a>  I do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1487.654s">I</a>  know all of it.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1488.734s">You</a>  people work during COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1490.055s">Policemen</a>  work during COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1491.335s">Firemen</a>  work during COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1492.395s">Everybody</a>  worked during COVID.</p>

    <p>[Tenaglia]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1494.416s">Did</a>  you guys come in for COVID when when you had meetings? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1497.677s">Or</a>  were you behind a TV screen?</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1500.279s">Amy,</a>  I'm gonna let you continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1501.539s">We</a>  do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1502.88s">I'm</a>  being very generous with time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1504.36s">I</a>  understand you're upset. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1505.02s">You</a>  have every right to be upset. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1507.042s">We</a>  give people 10 minutes for public participation, we're nearing a half hour, I'm absolutely gonna let you finish.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1511.165s">I'm</a>  gonna get to- Everyone in this building deserves the same raise that the teachers got, which is the 3%.</p>

    <p>[Tenaglia]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1517.049s">I'm</a>  sorry, I think we deserve more.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1518.87s">Oh,</a>  that's it, but let's see. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1520.672s">I</a>  just want everybody to know- Nobody is less important than anyone else here.</p>

    <p>[Tenaglia]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1523.454s">The</a>  president is gonna cut me off soon, which I understand, but I want everybody to know you're being lied to. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1529.998s">You're</a>  being lied to and you're accepting it, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1533.821s">We're</a>  better than this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1536.585s">I'm</a>  so disgusted by what I see on a daily basis, what I hear on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1543.691s">I</a>  just, you know, the citizens of Medford need to know the truth. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1550.817s">And</a>  sadly they don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1553.039s">And</a>  sadly things keep going on and on and they get worse and worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1557.868s">And</a>  we're left behind, as usual, right 3% raise for me is well 2% would have been 56 cents an hour so 3% wouldn't have been that much more. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1570.418s">What</a>  am I going to do with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1572.06s">Tell</a>  me what I'm going to do with 56 cents an hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1576.083s">What</a>  would you do with it, what would you do with it.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1581.468s">Mr.</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1583.169s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1585.811s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1587.543s">Amy,</a>  thank you for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1588.604s">I</a>  don't feel entitled to you sympathizing with anything that I have to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1592.325s">You</a>  have every right to be upset. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1593.546s">I</a>  just, I don't want you to get up here and put yourself out there and may not respond. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1597.868s">I</a>  just want to say, if you think that we're getting everything that we want, I feel like we're not getting anything that we want. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1606.593s">I'm</a>  speaking from the heart here, person to person. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1612.756s">I</a>  want everybody in the city to get a raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1614.877s">We're</a>  the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1617.099s">cannot</a>  negotiate with unions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1619.379s">We</a>  can't make appropriations. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1620.74s">It's</a>  why my drumbeat for the past three months has been about these charter amendments, which I hope that I would get a call from the mayor by today saying that she's something to the AG and she didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1629.221s">That's</a>  why my persistent frustration has been with our lack of power during this budget process. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1633.882s">But</a>  it's not fair to me that your negotiations are not resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1640.103s">It's</a>  not at all fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1641.783s">The</a>  whole process of bargaining negotiations of the city, I think, <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1646.576s">Obviously</a>  unfair. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1647.959s">Not</a>  everybody should get the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1649.261s">The</a>  people who are paid the least should get the most and it should go up from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1653.229s">All</a>  that is to say, I don't want you to think, well, you can think whatever you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1658.285s">But</a>  I want to put on the record, I don't think that what's happening is acceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1661.348s">I</a>  am looking at a situation where so much of what we see is deeply, deeply, deeply unacceptable to me, deeply unacceptable and unfair. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1667.613s">And</a>  it makes me sad. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1669.334s">It</a>  makes me sad, but I am aware of the legal limits of my power. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1673.237s">So</a>  when a paper comes before me to give some employees a raise, if I have the opportunity to say yes to a raise for some people, I'll say yes to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1680.383s">And</a>  I'm going to wish with all my heart that I had the ability to transmit that raise to people. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1684.827s">that</a>  have to negotiate for it and I am sorry that I can't do more materially for you and your union in this situation.</p>

    <p>[Tenaglia]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1689.81s">You</a>  can change the budget right you can change line items and not, or you can't change anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1694.794s">That's</a>  what I was told what a meeting or two ago, you can reduce, you can reduce and reduce. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1699.877s">That's</a>  it, we can add, cut down something that's important, something that they need, make a point.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1707.119s">And</a>  I just want to just be on that point we did that last year Amy we did that at what one o'clock in the morning the mayor came up here in the magic money tree in her that grows in her office she shook it bunch of money fell out of it next thing you know we were going to get a lawyer that was going to come and help us out with zoning never happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1720.783s">What</a>  else we're going to get out of that deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1723.104s">City</a>  solicitor yeah assistant city solicitor the city council, never happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1726.885s">Well,</a>  it's something else was supposed to come out of that too I think but you know what I mean. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1729.946s">And</a>  then the way that they were going to fund all of these promises that they made to the council was they were going to take the money out of the negotiated salaries account, which is the account that they use to fund your raises. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1737.873s">And</a>  this council said, no, you're not taking the money out of that account. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1740.775s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1741.115s">So</a>  if you want to find magic money, you better find it somewhere else because you're not balancing this budget on the back of the working people in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1746.84s">And</a>  the mayor went and took the money out of the public utility account. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1749.382s">So</a>  now we look at the transfers that are on the agenda this evening, we'll see hundreds of thousands of dollars in transfers so that we can pay to keep the lights on.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1756.397s">Councilor</a>  Collins, are you finished?</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1757.779s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1758.2s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1758.901s">Councilor</a>  Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1762.086s">I'll</a>  be brief, and if I have more, I'll go after. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1767.611s">I</a>  know you're upset at us because of that vote that we took a while ago, and I don't think I can say anything that will make you feel better about the situation, and I know a lot of the folks in the crowd tonight, I know you guys personally, and I have to be upfront that I don't think I'm gonna make you guys happy in an instant, but I will say that vote that we took back then was, in my mind, the deciding question for it was, will this really help <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1795.788s">the</a>  unions that are negotiating contracts, get what they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1799.192s">And</a>  I think we discussed it in detail back then, the answer that in my experience of dealing in with, you know, different players in this in the city, the answer was no. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1811.152s">And</a>  the answer was that whatever would happen would happen other channels, and not through this and I couldn't because of that answer I couldn't use that to justify holding up 2% raises for people who still work for the city or still city workers, and I understand that you guys are going to be super upset about that with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1829.811s">Um,</a>  but that was the reason why I took that vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1833.034s">That's</a>  the reason why I still support that.</p>
