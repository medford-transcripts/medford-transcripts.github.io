22
00:01:09,381 --> 00:01:16,264
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. President, thank you very much, and thank you very much to the Medford High School GBL champion girls lacrosse team for being here this evening.

23
00:01:16,685 --> 00:01:18,165
[SPEAKER_26]: You've had a wonderful season.

24
00:01:18,185 --> 00:01:19,186
[SPEAKER_26]: You've made us very proud.

25
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:27,089
[SPEAKER_26]: And because of that, I put a resolution forward, along with Council President DelaRusso, recognizing you for your great achievement of winning the GBL crown.

26
00:01:27,709 --> 00:01:33,432
[SPEAKER_26]: So with that being said, I'd like to ask Coach Galluzzi to come up here and join me, as well as the team, and we'll pass out some citations.

27
00:01:54,882 --> 00:01:55,162
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

28
00:01:55,442 --> 00:02:01,147
[SPEAKER_26]: It's very fitting to have Coach Galussi up here, because when I was a young kid playing Park League, he taught me everything that I knew about lacrosse.

29
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:04,870
[SPEAKER_26]: It's an honor and a privilege, Coach, to have you up here with me this evening.

30
00:02:05,271 --> 00:02:08,053
[SPEAKER_26]: And I'd like to take an opportunity to read this citation into the record.

31
00:02:08,934 --> 00:02:22,125
[SPEAKER_26]: The Medford City Council takes pleasure in awarding this council commendation to Adrian Perrazzo, captain, Medford High School varsity girls lacrosse team, in recognition of winning the Greater Boston League title and a berth in the MIA Division I North State Tournament.

32
00:02:36,701 --> 00:02:42,462
[SPEAKER_26]: Hannah Gallop, one of our captains, not here this evening.

33
00:02:43,223 --> 00:02:47,064
[SPEAKER_26]: Next on the list would be Nicole Mortel, another captain.

34
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:59,631
[SPEAKER_26]: Brianna Burke, captain.

35
00:03:01,432 --> 00:03:03,753
[SPEAKER_25]: Daughter of former budget director Stephanie Muccini-Burke.

36
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:10,257
[SPEAKER_13]: Just a quick word, too, about the four captains.

37
00:03:10,277 --> 00:03:16,802
[SPEAKER_13]: They were all selected to play in the Gannis all-star lacrosse game, which is going to take place Thursday at 1230.

38
00:03:17,022 --> 00:03:18,503
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's a big recognition.

39
00:03:18,523 --> 00:03:20,844
[SPEAKER_13]: At the Manning Bowl, it's a statewide all-star game.

40
00:03:20,864 --> 00:03:22,265
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's a big deal for them.

41
00:03:22,325 --> 00:03:23,225
[SPEAKER_26]: Congratulations, girls.

42
00:03:23,986 --> 00:03:24,546
[SPEAKER_26]: Carolyn Daly.

43
00:03:35,024 --> 00:03:35,604
[SPEAKER_14]: Nope.

44
00:03:36,085 --> 00:03:38,046
[SPEAKER_14]: They'll all get them at the banquet.

45
00:03:38,126 --> 00:03:38,287
[SPEAKER_14]: Nope.

46
00:03:41,289 --> 00:03:41,469
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

47
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:42,450
[SPEAKER_25]: Jill McCarthy.

48
00:03:47,955 --> 00:03:48,496
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks for coming.

49
00:03:49,316 --> 00:03:49,456
Nope.

50
00:03:49,476 --> 00:03:49,617
Yes.

51
00:03:49,697 --> 00:03:51,058
Alex Joba.

52
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:11,148
[SPEAKER_22]: Congratulations.

53
00:04:11,428 --> 00:04:12,429
[SPEAKER_22]: Patricia McLean.

54
00:04:12,469 --> 00:04:16,011
[SPEAKER_22]: Kylie Mahoney.

55
00:04:16,031 --> 00:04:16,071
[SPEAKER_26]: No.

56
00:04:39,736 --> 00:04:50,458
[SPEAKER_26]: Coach said all his team's at home studying for finals right now, so they're not able to make it this evening.

57
00:04:50,518 --> 00:04:56,439
[SPEAKER_22]: Caroline Cronin.

58
00:04:56,459 --> 00:04:57,219
[SPEAKER_22]: Last but not least.

59
00:05:07,865 --> 00:05:11,486
[SPEAKER_26]: I'd like to offer the microphone to Coach Galluzzi for a few kind words.

60
00:05:12,046 --> 00:05:14,906
[SPEAKER_13]: Just real quick, I want to thank the council for recognizing the girls.

61
00:05:15,747 --> 00:05:18,047
[SPEAKER_13]: Like Mr. Knight said, they had a great season.

62
00:05:18,647 --> 00:05:27,289
[SPEAKER_13]: We started the year at two and nine, and then we had to win eight of our last nine games to even qualify for the tournament, which we did on our very last game.

63
00:05:27,309 --> 00:05:28,349
[SPEAKER_13]: We were losing the whole game.

64
00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:30,950
[SPEAKER_13]: We came back to even qualify to get in the tournament.

65
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:34,090
[SPEAKER_13]: So for us to even make it this year was quite an accomplishment.

66
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,671
[SPEAKER_13]: It didn't go the way we wanted it to in the tournament,

67
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:41,640
[SPEAKER_13]: seventh consecutive GBL, seventh consecutive tournament bird, so I'm proud of these girls.

68
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:42,860
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you all for having us.

69
00:05:49,902 --> 00:05:56,824
[SPEAKER_26]: We also have joining us this evening the Medford High School Mustangs girls softball team who had an unbelievable year this year.

70
00:05:57,324 --> 00:05:59,465
[SPEAKER_26]: They were one game away from the state finals, I believe.

71
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:03,406
[SPEAKER_26]: With that being said, I'd like to ask Coach Dempsey to join me up here this evening.

72
00:06:12,667 --> 00:06:16,773
[SPEAKER_25]: Coach Dempsey's Division 1 North Coach of the Year, Boston Globe.

73
00:06:23,863 --> 00:06:24,824
[SPEAKER_26]: The ceiling ain't gonna fall down.

[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

79
00:06:46,623 --> 00:06:47,144
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

80
00:06:47,624 --> 00:06:50,926
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, Coach, thank you very much for joining me this evening and thank you to the team.

81
00:06:51,226 --> 00:06:54,968
[SPEAKER_26]: I'd like to ask the team to step up and we'll have an opportunity to present you with your citations.

82
00:06:55,869 --> 00:07:00,091
[SPEAKER_26]: The citation reads, the Medford City Council takes pleasure in awarding this council commendation

[SPEAKER_25]: Katrina Rashi.

88
00:08:23,634 --> 00:08:24,715
[SPEAKER_26]: Amber Harbison.

89
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:39,005
[SPEAKER_25]: I'd like to turn the stage over to

90
00:08:39,928 --> 00:08:42,670
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr Dempsey, a few kind words on behalf of the team.

91
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:43,230
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

92
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:48,394
[SPEAKER_12]: First of all, I'd like to thank the city council for having our team here and honoring us as well as the lacrosse team.

93
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,977
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, we did have an unbelievable season.

94
00:08:51,997 --> 00:08:53,077
[SPEAKER_12]: The kids were incredible.

95
00:08:54,098 --> 00:09:01,403
[SPEAKER_12]: Most of them aren't here tonight cause they have ball games and I was hoping for a thunderstorm so they all could come, but they had the other commitment.

96
00:09:01,984 --> 00:09:06,607
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, just a couple of things I want to mention and we, we had five,

97
00:09:07,054 --> 00:09:11,817
[SPEAKER_12]: Greater Boston League All-Stars with the Greater Boston League MVP, Ashley Eisner.

98
00:09:12,497 --> 00:09:22,582
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd also like to recognize Brianna Napoleone, Hannah O'Leary, Bailey Flynn, Julia Carney, as Greater Boston League All-Stars.

99
00:09:22,602 --> 00:09:32,628
[SPEAKER_12]: And Ashley, for the third year in a row, has been the Greater Boston League MVP, as well as, like Mr. Knight just mentioned,

100
00:09:34,758 --> 00:09:39,002
[SPEAKER_12]: held in Boston Globe, All Scholastic, which will be coming out, I believe, this week.

101
00:09:45,248 --> 00:09:46,068
[SPEAKER_12]: We had a lot of help.

102
00:09:46,109 --> 00:09:50,433
[SPEAKER_12]: These kids are unbelievable, and it's easy cozy kids that like to work.

103
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:51,474
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much.

104
00:09:57,833 --> 00:10:00,675
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think that concludes the presentations for this evening.

105
00:10:00,715 --> 00:10:09,062
[SPEAKER_26]: We also have some recognition for the boys lacrosse team, who were the GBL champions as well, and the boys baseball team, who were the GBL champions.

106
00:10:09,102 --> 00:10:13,305
[SPEAKER_26]: But I don't believe that anybody was able to attend from either one of those teams this evening.

107
00:10:13,365 --> 00:10:17,108
[SPEAKER_26]: So thank you very much to the girls softball team and the girls lacrosse team.

108
00:10:17,428 --> 00:10:19,030
[SPEAKER_26]: Congratulations on a wonderful season.

00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:19,950
[SPEAKER_26]: You've made us all proud.

110
00:10:20,611 --> 00:10:22,512
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you very much for being here this evening.

111
00:10:22,572 --> 00:10:23,453
[SPEAKER_26]: And thank you very much.

112
00:10:23,793 --> 00:10:25,875
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, we do have some of the lacrosse team here.

113
00:10:27,642 --> 00:10:28,382
[SPEAKER_26]: Liam, come on up.

114
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:42,367
[SPEAKER_22]: You're the only one?

00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:53,511

00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:42,763
[SPEAKER_21]: Uh, 15, uh, five, five, seven offered by counselor care of yellow, uh, be resolved that the Memphis city council have police chief building inspector code enforcement and board of health investigate the several massage parlors

136
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:46,452
[SPEAKER_21]: operating in our community, Councilor Caraviello.

137
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:48,374
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Mr. President.

138
00:13:48,454 --> 00:14:07,128
[SPEAKER_28]: Mr. President, I don't know if people have noticed, but over the weekend, a third massage parlor has opened up right in the heart of Method Square, which is right next to the pawn shop that's already have people in the square unhappy with.

139
00:14:07,568 --> 00:14:12,692
[SPEAKER_28]: Mr. President, we have one operating on Central Avenue,

140
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:18,422
[SPEAKER_28]: which is right beside a residential home in a park where children play.

141
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:22,484
[SPEAKER_28]: We have another one operating on Main Street, which is in a residential neighborhood.

142
00:14:23,004 --> 00:14:26,606
[SPEAKER_28]: And then now we have this one, which is right in the center of our city.

143
00:14:27,026 --> 00:14:31,448
[SPEAKER_28]: It's a square that we're trying to rebuild and do over, and this is what's coming into it.

144
00:14:32,528 --> 00:14:41,892
[SPEAKER_28]: Mr. President, also, I mean, these three establishments, they advertise on a daily basis, and the adult sections, the back page,

145
00:14:42,797 --> 00:14:44,418
[SPEAKER_28]: and Craigslist.

146
00:14:44,818 --> 00:14:52,461
[SPEAKER_28]: So they're obviously not doing the normal therapeutic massage services.

147
00:14:52,721 --> 00:14:55,122
[SPEAKER_28]: They're doing things that we know that they shouldn't be doing there.

148
00:14:55,582 --> 00:15:01,285
[SPEAKER_28]: And they were here a couple of years ago, and the chief pretty much rid the community of them.

149
00:15:01,605 --> 00:15:04,706
[SPEAKER_28]: But now they seem to be coming back in.

150
00:15:04,726 --> 00:15:07,427
[SPEAKER_28]: You let one, two, and they're all back.

151
00:15:07,487 --> 00:15:10,929
[SPEAKER_28]: I mean, this is not a problem that's immune to our community.

152
00:15:11,822 --> 00:15:13,183
[SPEAKER_28]: It happens in a lot of other communities.

153
00:15:13,463 --> 00:15:20,765
[SPEAKER_28]: They come in, they operate for two or three months, and then they're gone again once the enforcement officers start getting them.

154
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:26,286
[SPEAKER_28]: But, you know, if you look at the one just that's in the square, it's obviously in violation of some of our codes.

155
00:15:26,786 --> 00:15:34,829
[SPEAKER_28]: And I'd like to have a response from all the departments for next week's meeting so we can discuss this again.

156
00:15:35,329 --> 00:15:38,830
[SPEAKER_28]: And I know there'll be more members of the community that would like to discuss this.

157
00:15:39,297 --> 00:15:45,138
[SPEAKER_28]: So if we could send that along to the proper departments, Mr. President, it would be greatly appreciated.

158
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:46,158
[SPEAKER_21]: Very good, Counselor.

159
00:15:46,218 --> 00:15:52,219
[SPEAKER_21]: So on the motion of Counselor Caravaglia to refer the paper to the department heads, Counselor Knight.

160
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:57,360
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. President, thank you very much, and thank you, Counselor Caravaglia, for putting this matter forward this evening.

161
00:15:58,381 --> 00:16:04,622
[SPEAKER_26]: I, too, got an email on this same topic, and I did some research, and it seems to me that

162
00:16:06,528 --> 00:16:09,951
[SPEAKER_26]: Massage therapy parlors are not under the scope and purview of the local authority.

163
00:16:10,231 --> 00:16:11,632
[SPEAKER_26]: They fall under that of the state.

164
00:16:12,113 --> 00:16:20,019
[SPEAKER_26]: So the department of professional licensure has a licensing branch that would be responsible for the oversight of massage parlors.

165
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:34,711
[SPEAKER_26]: And it's my understanding based upon conversations that I've had with the code enforcement officer that they have reported this facility into the state for investigation and assurance with compliance, Mr. President.

166
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:41,801
[SPEAKER_26]: I just wanted the council to be aware that it's outside of local control and the local authority.

167
00:16:41,821 --> 00:16:43,042
[SPEAKER_26]: It really lies within the state.

168
00:16:43,623 --> 00:16:53,689
[SPEAKER_26]: And it's my understanding also that the proposed use of the location in Medford Square is a personal services use.

169
00:16:53,729 --> 00:16:57,812
[SPEAKER_26]: It was a former barber shop, and now it's a massage parlor, which falls in the same use.

170
00:16:57,832 --> 00:16:58,892
[SPEAKER_26]: So it's a conforming use.

171
00:16:59,913 --> 00:17:03,635
[SPEAKER_26]: So that's one of the reasons why the business was able to open there.

172
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:04,436
[SPEAKER_26]: It's a conforming use.

173
00:17:04,476 --> 00:17:06,197
[SPEAKER_26]: No special permit was necessary or needed.

174
00:17:06,794 --> 00:17:16,282
[SPEAKER_26]: But with that being said, I think that the appropriate place to send the question would be to the State's Division of Professional Licensure as opposed to local authorities because they don't have any oversight.

175
00:17:17,523 --> 00:17:17,883
[SPEAKER_21]: Very good.

176
00:17:17,963 --> 00:17:18,664
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Councilor.

177
00:17:18,724 --> 00:17:19,384
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Pinto.

178
00:17:21,286 --> 00:17:33,736
[SPEAKER_29]: Including or concurring with the remarks of Councilor Knight, I think what we need is a report back from our city solicitor that basically addresses the fact that it's a concern here within our community.

179
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:36,118
[SPEAKER_29]: And since it's an allowable or

180
00:17:36,659 --> 00:18:00,166
[SPEAKER_29]: appearing to be an allowable use according to our zoning, I think what needs to be addressed is maybe addressing the licensure division back in Boston and indicating to them that something like this should come under the authority of the local legislative body rather than a state agency because the effect of the granting of this particular license does affect the community, whether it's abutting a residential, commercial, or what have you.

181
00:18:00,786 --> 00:18:03,107
[SPEAKER_29]: And with that being said, I would ask that

182
00:18:03,975 --> 00:18:31,512
[SPEAKER_29]: if this is what the case needs to be, that our city solicitor provide to us the legalese in writing to support either a recommendation, I don't know, I think it would be a home rule petition, it might be just a waiver of rules and regulations that the Division of Licensure might have at the present time to support local communities, whether they want it or they won't want it, because unfortunately there is no public hearing, there is no public commentary on this,

183
00:18:32,417 --> 00:18:38,019
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Knight just alluded to, they could go anywhere they want because the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is allowing this to their license or division.

184
00:18:38,339 --> 00:18:42,920
[SPEAKER_29]: So I'm going to move that as an amendment to the resolution to find out just where we can go with this.

185
00:18:43,821 --> 00:18:49,102
[SPEAKER_21]: So on the motion of Councilor Caviello, as amended by Councilor Penta, Councilor Caviello.

186
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:51,223
[SPEAKER_28]: Mr. President, Councilor Knight is right.

187
00:18:51,243 --> 00:19:00,846
[SPEAKER_28]: You know, there's this minimal that the city can do because, you know, they don't have to have a license, but they are in violation at the moment of the sign ordinance because 100% of their window

188
00:19:02,103 --> 00:19:02,603
[SPEAKER_28]: It's taken up.

189
00:19:03,644 --> 00:19:05,324
[SPEAKER_28]: It's blocked from view.

190
00:19:05,424 --> 00:19:14,048
[SPEAKER_28]: And again, if the police are in there and putting pressure on them, it keeps their customers away.

191
00:19:14,728 --> 00:19:17,329
[SPEAKER_28]: And once their customers go away, they go away.

192
00:19:17,349 --> 00:19:20,251
[SPEAKER_28]: Because you've noticed other communities, they've been here before.

193
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:22,592
[SPEAKER_28]: They come for two or three months, and then they'll be gone.

194
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:30,475
[SPEAKER_28]: So I think if the police put a little pressure on them and the other authorities put a little pressure on them,

195
00:19:31,358 --> 00:19:35,621
[SPEAKER_28]: they'll see that we mean business in this community, and we're not going to stand for that type of business here.

196
00:19:35,921 --> 00:19:44,407
[SPEAKER_28]: Like I say, because if you see where they're advertising, they're not advertising things that I want in my community.

197
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,391
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Councilor Caviello.

198
00:19:50,451 --> 00:20:00,017
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think if the councilors remember, we did receive an opinion that sent the matter to the DPL from the city solicitor.

199
00:20:00,771 --> 00:20:01,471
[SPEAKER_21]: some years ago.

200
00:20:02,412 --> 00:20:03,472
[SPEAKER_21]: Constable Alongo-Kern.

201
00:20:03,872 --> 00:20:06,493
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, President De La Russo.

202
00:20:06,933 --> 00:20:08,133
[SPEAKER_07]: I, too, received the emails.

203
00:20:08,254 --> 00:20:14,155
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually shot off one of the complaints to the chief of police because this is such a problem.

204
00:20:15,136 --> 00:20:17,837
[SPEAKER_07]: We were well aware it was state regulated.

205
00:20:17,877 --> 00:20:21,978
[SPEAKER_07]: We had a committee of the whole meetings on this two years ago when it was a real issue.

206
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:29,963
[SPEAKER_07]: But I believe that our city, I think Councilor DelaRusso and Councilor Carviello is correct by having our officials involved in this.

207
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:37,707
[SPEAKER_07]: Not only can they put pressure on the state, but it was the police in the community of Medford that completely eliminated one of the shops.

208
00:20:37,787 --> 00:20:45,831
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe they were investigating for months and months a number of the pilers, and we did create an end to the problem.

209
00:20:45,891 --> 00:20:48,572
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, all of a sudden, they're back, so I just think

210
00:20:48,908 --> 00:21:13,642
[SPEAKER_07]: we need to not only ask our city officials to do what they can do and put pressure on the state, and then also figure out if there's a way we can, we had a meeting on it already, it didn't seem like Karen Rose was able to get that done with regards to requiring the permits to come through the city of Medford, but obviously if she can maybe look into that again, I think that would give us the extra oomph we need to really work on it.

211
00:21:13,842 --> 00:21:16,023
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a disgrace when our residents are emailing us

212
00:21:16,617 --> 00:21:22,461
[SPEAKER_07]: and asking questions and just appalled at, you know, what's going on and what's being advertised in our community.

213
00:21:22,861 --> 00:21:28,265
[SPEAKER_07]: We have children and teenagers who frequent the square, you know, especially during the summer months.

214
00:21:28,405 --> 00:21:33,568
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's just something I don't, I wouldn't want my children walking by and being witnessed to.

215
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:36,890
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think every council is correct.

216
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:46,056
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think we just need to put pressure on, you know, everybody we can to make sure this is investigated and give the police the tools to make sure that we can do what we can to

217
00:21:46,776 --> 00:21:48,997
[SPEAKER_07]: rid them of our community, from our community.

218
00:21:51,278 --> 00:21:52,458
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

219
00:21:52,498 --> 00:21:53,078
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Knight.

220
00:21:53,558 --> 00:21:54,959
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. President, yes, thank you.

221
00:21:55,899 --> 00:22:04,362
[SPEAKER_26]: I believe it was Chapter 135 of the Acts of 2006 that was passed that created this board that would govern massage therapy parlors.

222
00:22:04,922 --> 00:22:16,046
[SPEAKER_26]: And the principal function of that piece of legislation was to actually take local control away from local boards of health so that they could be consistent and across the board policy.

223
00:22:16,399 --> 00:22:18,940
[SPEAKER_26]: from community to community, city to city, town to town.

224
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,581
[SPEAKER_26]: I think that it's a bad piece of legislation.

225
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:22,461
[SPEAKER_26]: It was a bad bill.

226
00:22:23,202 --> 00:22:25,523
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, we can't take away the control of our local Board of Health.

227
00:22:25,923 --> 00:22:31,225
[SPEAKER_26]: They're doing an exceptional job in ensuring our safety and our protection and well-being.

228
00:22:31,605 --> 00:22:33,106
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think that's one of the primary flaws.

229
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:35,687
[SPEAKER_26]: It's actually with the legislation that was passed, Mr. President.

230
00:22:35,967 --> 00:22:42,209
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think that going forward, this council might want to sit down and meet with our delegation to see maybe if there's something we can do to change that.

231
00:22:45,143 --> 00:22:52,047
[SPEAKER_21]: So on the motion of Councilor Caravaglio, as amended by Councilor Penta, Councilor Marks.

232
00:22:53,448 --> 00:22:54,408
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Mr. President.

233
00:22:54,448 --> 00:22:57,050
[SPEAKER_31]: I want to thank my Councilor colleague for putting this on the agenda.

234
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:05,835
[SPEAKER_31]: This is a very important issue, but I think the larger issue here that we have to look at, it's great to have the Chief of Police go down and

235
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:08,380
[SPEAKER_31]: do what he can do or the building commissioner.

236
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:15,526
[SPEAKER_31]: But we also have to look at new investment, attracting new businesses into our business districts.

237
00:23:16,167 --> 00:23:22,533
[SPEAKER_31]: And we've failed as a community for the past 25 years in revitalizing our business districts.

238
00:23:23,473 --> 00:23:27,017
[SPEAKER_31]: And what we're seeing right now is you're seeing best sellers.

239
00:23:27,417 --> 00:23:31,821
[SPEAKER_31]: You're seeing Forest Street, the art place that was on Forest Street.

240
00:23:32,205 --> 00:23:33,606
[SPEAKER_31]: You're seeing Ward's gifts.

241
00:23:33,926 --> 00:23:39,910
[SPEAKER_31]: You're seeing a number of decent, long-established businesses in this community moving out, Mr. President.

242
00:23:40,251 --> 00:23:47,476
[SPEAKER_31]: And what we're getting in is pawn shops, massage parlors, because there's no clear direction in this community.

243
00:23:48,084 --> 00:23:58,109
[SPEAKER_31]: This administration, this Office of Community Development, has done nothing to improve the business districts, not just in Meffitt Square, but all five business districts throughout our community.

244
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:04,753
[SPEAKER_31]: And now we're seeing the repercussions of a lax government that doesn't care what moves in.

245
00:24:05,433 --> 00:24:06,274
[SPEAKER_31]: You know why they're coming in?

246
00:24:06,634 --> 00:24:07,695
[SPEAKER_31]: Look at the open spaces.

247
00:24:08,415 --> 00:24:10,036
[SPEAKER_31]: Go around the square, look at the open fronts.

248
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:13,798
[SPEAKER_31]: Go to Davis Square, see if you can get a front.

249
00:24:14,365 --> 00:24:16,186
[SPEAKER_31]: a storefront for cheap money in Davis Square.

250
00:24:16,447 --> 00:24:17,207
[SPEAKER_31]: It's on the street.

251
00:24:17,367 --> 00:24:18,428
[SPEAKER_31]: It can't be had.

252
00:24:18,949 --> 00:24:19,869
[SPEAKER_31]: It can't be had.

253
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:20,630
[SPEAKER_31]: You know why?

254
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:23,492
[SPEAKER_31]: Because they've revitalized their business districts.

255
00:24:23,832 --> 00:24:26,294
[SPEAKER_31]: They're attracting businesses that are growing.

256
00:24:26,595 --> 00:24:29,097
[SPEAKER_31]: They're creating a neighborhood of businesses.

257
00:24:29,457 --> 00:24:32,539
[SPEAKER_31]: And that currently does not exist within our city.

258
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,843
[SPEAKER_31]: And now we're seeing the results, Mr. President.

259
00:24:37,383 --> 00:24:43,448
[SPEAKER_31]: And, you know, I support having the police go down there and the closing up and so forth and the investigations and so forth.

260
00:24:44,308 --> 00:24:45,869
[SPEAKER_31]: But let's look at the root cause.

261
00:24:47,149 --> 00:24:54,013
[SPEAKER_31]: Nothing has been done by this Office of Community Development in the past five years to attract new investments into our business districts.

262
00:24:55,133 --> 00:24:56,054
[SPEAKER_31]: Nothing at all.

263
00:24:56,474 --> 00:24:58,695
[SPEAKER_31]: And we've spoke about it time and time again.

264
00:24:58,715 --> 00:25:01,197
[SPEAKER_31]: You know, it's not the field of dreams.

265
00:25:01,257 --> 00:25:02,277
[SPEAKER_31]: If you build it, they'll come.

266
00:25:02,817 --> 00:25:04,538
[SPEAKER_31]: We haven't built anything in this community.

267
00:25:05,899 --> 00:25:11,322
[SPEAKER_31]: We have an area where pedestrians can't walk in a safe manner around our business districts.

268
00:25:11,622 --> 00:25:14,043
[SPEAKER_31]: They're afraid to cross High Street and Main Street.

269
00:25:14,937 --> 00:25:16,458
[SPEAKER_31]: You have poor lighting in the square.

270
00:25:17,499 --> 00:25:20,021
[SPEAKER_31]: You have filthy, dirty streets, Mr. President.

271
00:25:20,261 --> 00:25:23,903
[SPEAKER_31]: If you go down there any time, you'll see the trash strewn throughout the area.

272
00:25:25,464 --> 00:25:29,607
[SPEAKER_31]: You know, it just, in my opinion, is a true lack of leadership.

273
00:25:30,268 --> 00:25:33,850
[SPEAKER_31]: And, you know, it's unfortunate, but now we're seeing what takes place.

274
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:40,154
[SPEAKER_31]: These seedy establishments find the areas they can infiltrate, and that's what's happening now.

275
00:25:40,995 --> 00:25:43,497
[SPEAKER_31]: Let's look at an area that's not well lit.

276
00:25:44,514 --> 00:25:45,595
[SPEAKER_31]: Aha, Meffitt Square.

277
00:25:46,736 --> 00:25:47,156
[SPEAKER_31]: Perfect.

278
00:25:51,058 --> 00:25:52,739
[SPEAKER_31]: Let's take a look at this, Mr. President.

279
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:58,924
[SPEAKER_31]: And let's just not react, because we're going to get establishments like this come in and out of our community.

280
00:25:59,384 --> 00:26:00,885
[SPEAKER_31]: Let's build a sense of community.

281
00:26:01,145 --> 00:26:07,469
[SPEAKER_31]: Let's build strong business districts that won't allow these type of establishments to move in, Mr. President.

282
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:11,872
[SPEAKER_31]: Let's have a communication with the landlords, Mr. President.

283
00:26:11,912 --> 00:26:13,233
[SPEAKER_31]: Let's have a game plan here.

284
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:16,772
[SPEAKER_31]: We have no game plan in this community, and it's unfortunate.

285
00:26:17,352 --> 00:26:21,795
[SPEAKER_31]: And I hope not only this massage parlor, but also the pawn shop.

286
00:26:22,296 --> 00:26:27,479
[SPEAKER_31]: And I wish all businesses well, but I've walked by that pawn shop a million times.

287
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:28,640
[SPEAKER_31]: I've never seen anyone in it.

288
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,302
[SPEAKER_31]: And I see a shelf that has a chainsaw.

289
00:26:33,162 --> 00:26:38,686
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't know the last time anyone behind this railings looked for a chainsaw, but it's possible people are looking for them out there.

290
00:26:40,067 --> 00:26:43,329
[SPEAKER_31]: But I don't see what type of business they're doing in there, Mr. President.

291
00:26:44,078 --> 00:26:55,923
[SPEAKER_31]: And it's unfortunate you as a business owner should be out there fighting for businesses and not just to reap the benefits where you are currently on Main Street, but to have your success citywide, Mr. President.

292
00:26:56,583 --> 00:27:04,106
[SPEAKER_31]: And so I would ask that this paper be forwarded to the Office of Community Development to see what their long-range plan is.

293
00:27:04,126 --> 00:27:08,288
[SPEAKER_31]: I mean, it's already been 25 years, so maybe they have a 50-year plan.

294
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:25,758
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm not sure, but I think we should be asking what the long-range plan is in this community to attract new businesses and to make our business district something we can be proud of, something that after seven o'clock they don't roll the sidewalks up and it's dark with no personnel.

295
00:27:26,358 --> 00:27:34,482
[SPEAKER_31]: That may work in your business, Mr. President, you know, but it's not working across the city and we need to invite new business, Mr. President.

296
00:27:35,043 --> 00:27:39,405
[SPEAKER_21]: On the motion of Councilor Caviello as amended, Councilor Pinto.

297
00:27:40,198 --> 00:27:52,160
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm glad Councilman Marks brought this up because the interesting component about this is when we had a conversation about this a few months back, I introduced the offering as what they did and I don't have my notes with me right now, so I apologize.

298
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:58,881
[SPEAKER_29]: But in Florida, they had a particular community where their downtown areas were exactly as Councilman Marks was alluding to.

299
00:27:59,281 --> 00:28:08,123
[SPEAKER_29]: And what they did is they made offerings to the owners of the property either with tax incentives or employment incentives or community-based incentives.

300
00:28:08,415 --> 00:28:16,518
[SPEAKER_29]: which would have allowed the owner of the property, whoever he rented out to, to get one of these benefits for the purposes of coming in.

301
00:28:17,099 --> 00:28:35,126
[SPEAKER_29]: And what they did is they sort of like took a particular street, and what they just did, from A to B to C to D. Now about three weeks ago, I went and I heard the lady who works for the community of Lowell, and she is not the community office director, but she is the director, I believe,

302
00:28:36,107 --> 00:28:37,328
[SPEAKER_29]: cultural resources.

303
00:28:37,448 --> 00:28:40,250
[SPEAKER_29]: And what they did is they took street by street.

304
00:28:40,771 --> 00:28:45,975
[SPEAKER_29]: And what they did, as Councilor Marks alluded to, they've alluded, they went from one street to the next street and just jumped.

305
00:28:46,415 --> 00:28:50,198
[SPEAKER_29]: And they just piggybacked all the way around to an entire portion of the town.

306
00:28:50,698 --> 00:28:53,821
[SPEAKER_29]: Where now, it doesn't happen overnight, but you need to have a beginning.

307
00:28:53,881 --> 00:28:54,982
[SPEAKER_29]: And that's what the beginning is.

308
00:28:55,502 --> 00:28:59,865
[SPEAKER_29]: It's unfortunate that this administration does not realize that, didn't take advantage of it.

309
00:29:00,306 --> 00:29:03,028
[SPEAKER_29]: We've talked about revitalizing Memphis Square three times in the

310
00:29:03,495 --> 00:29:06,316
[SPEAKER_29]: past 20 years, and it hasn't happened.

311
00:29:06,596 --> 00:29:08,556
[SPEAKER_29]: But what needs to happen is the business people.

312
00:29:08,936 --> 00:29:15,158
[SPEAKER_29]: And this is a true test now for the Chamber of Commerce to come to life and say, hey, you know, we want good businesses to be here in Medford Square.

313
00:29:15,458 --> 00:29:17,859
[SPEAKER_29]: We want to be a working partner here with the city of Medford.

314
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:22,760
[SPEAKER_29]: And if this is the issue tonight, and it really brings it to head, then so be it.

315
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,841
[SPEAKER_29]: And I think you're right, Councilor Marks.

316
00:29:26,261 --> 00:29:27,421
[SPEAKER_29]: I just think this is the time.

317
00:29:28,142 --> 00:29:30,962
[SPEAKER_29]: The people really need to know, you know, what their government is doing.

318
00:29:30,982 --> 00:29:32,163
[SPEAKER_29]: You know, what is the forecast?

319
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:32,863
[SPEAKER_29]: What is the plan?

320
00:29:33,293 --> 00:29:37,456
[SPEAKER_29]: you know, what's the open window and the fresh air going to be all about as it relates to where we're going.

321
00:29:38,117 --> 00:29:42,060
[SPEAKER_29]: So I support, I support your thoughts and I can assure you that that would be in my plan.

322
00:29:43,361 --> 00:29:43,781
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

323
00:29:44,682 --> 00:29:45,022
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

324
00:29:45,062 --> 00:29:45,463
[SPEAKER_21]: Counselor.

325
00:29:45,503 --> 00:29:46,323
[SPEAKER_21]: Counselor.

326
00:29:46,724 --> 00:29:47,244
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

327
00:29:47,284 --> 00:29:52,248
[SPEAKER_28]: One more thing, you know, councilor marks mentioned about rolling the sidewalks up at seven o'clock.

328
00:29:53,049 --> 00:30:02,196
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know if anyone's been to that part of the street, but the streets are already rolled up in that part of the square because of the constant bus traffic is,

329
00:30:03,861 --> 00:30:10,807
[SPEAKER_28]: There's a rolling street there that people are tripping over and cars have a hard time maneuvering.

330
00:30:12,208 --> 00:30:18,534
[SPEAKER_28]: And that's also because there's no care for that part of the square.

331
00:30:19,034 --> 00:30:23,198
[SPEAKER_28]: So again, that will be something else I'd like to have looked into, Mr. President.

332
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:28,102
[SPEAKER_20]: On the motion, ma'am, please state your name and address for the record.

333
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:28,730
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

334
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:33,351
[SPEAKER_01]: Jean Martin, 10 Cumming Street, and both Mr. Carviello and Mr. Marks are absolutely right.

335
00:30:33,991 --> 00:30:38,652
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a complex problem, and it gives a bad name to actual massage parlors.

336
00:30:39,193 --> 00:30:41,253
[SPEAKER_01]: They're actually fronts for prostitution rings.

337
00:30:42,133 --> 00:30:44,494
[SPEAKER_01]: I have personal knowledge, and don't laugh.

338
00:30:45,034 --> 00:30:51,135
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually met some women that are in these rings a couple of years ago, and it's not just Medford.

339
00:30:51,175 --> 00:30:51,816
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Somerville.

340
00:30:51,836 --> 00:30:52,696
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Boston.

341
00:30:53,316 --> 00:30:53,936
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all over.

342
00:30:54,216 --> 00:30:54,776
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Malden.

343
00:30:55,036 --> 00:30:57,437
[SPEAKER_01]: It's everywhere, and it's organized.

344
00:30:58,298 --> 00:30:59,518
[SPEAKER_01]: and people are running these women.

345
00:31:01,499 --> 00:31:05,879
[SPEAKER_01]: It's $80 if you get a massage, and it's $160 if you have a transaction.

346
00:31:06,579 --> 00:31:08,080
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that simple.

347
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,440
[SPEAKER_01]: So it gives massage parlors a bad name, number one.

348
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:14,101
[SPEAKER_01]: Number two, it's multifaceted, and we need to deal with it.

349
00:31:14,541 --> 00:31:15,941
[SPEAKER_01]: You can deal with it, Mr. Carvello.

350
00:31:15,961 --> 00:31:20,602
[SPEAKER_01]: All you got to do is put cameras in front of all these stores and put the names of the Johns after they come out.

351
00:31:20,682 --> 00:31:23,922
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you catch them, just put their name in the paper.

352
00:31:23,962 --> 00:31:25,203
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll stop the customers from coming.

353
00:31:25,643 --> 00:31:27,783
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, like Mr. Mark said,

354
00:31:30,714 --> 00:31:35,999
[SPEAKER_01]: it'll only have another one six months later come in and fill that gap, because the gap is there to be filled.

355
00:31:36,479 --> 00:31:51,532
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, and I'm all for mom and pops, but if Medford Square cannot sustain a mom and pop because they can't compete, then we need to bring in chain stores, chain businesses that are bigger and can handle the kind of prices that Medford has now.

356
00:31:51,793 --> 00:31:52,934
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a small town anymore.

357
00:31:53,334 --> 00:31:54,255
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's what we have to do,

358
00:31:54,782 --> 00:31:59,244
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also, for the business community, we need to think one step higher than what we have.

359
00:31:59,704 --> 00:32:07,027
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we have a Chamber of Commerce, we need to have them meet with Boston's Chamber of Commerce.

360
00:32:07,427 --> 00:32:11,168
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to start stepping it up one notch and see what ideas they have.

361
00:32:11,288 --> 00:32:12,909
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is Boston doing so good?

362
00:32:13,509 --> 00:32:16,150
[SPEAKER_01]: We need a mentorship program for businesses in this city.

363
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:20,852
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how you'll really fill that hole so that nobody else will backfill it.

364
00:32:21,912 --> 00:32:24,413
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, this is a multifaceted issue, and I feel for these women.

365
00:32:26,338 --> 00:32:28,439
[SPEAKER_01]: They're sober and they're clean.

366
00:32:28,859 --> 00:32:29,539
[SPEAKER_01]: They're organized.

367
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:30,300
[SPEAKER_01]: They're well-dressed.

368
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:35,401
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're being abused, mentally and emotionally.

369
00:32:36,261 --> 00:32:36,941
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you very much.

370
00:32:36,961 --> 00:32:37,842
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

371
00:32:37,862 --> 00:32:41,142
[SPEAKER_21]: On the motion by Councilor Caviello, as amended, all those in favor?

372
00:32:41,863 --> 00:32:42,503
[SPEAKER_21]: All those opposed?

373
00:32:43,243 --> 00:32:44,003
[SPEAKER_21]: Motion carries.

374
00:32:44,964 --> 00:32:46,024
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Pinto?

375
00:32:48,765 --> 00:32:50,865
[SPEAKER_29]: Can we take 15552?

376
00:32:50,925 --> 00:32:53,786
[SPEAKER_29]: Because I told some business people we would be addressing that.

377
00:32:54,322 --> 00:32:55,163
[SPEAKER_29]: within the first hour.

378
00:32:58,265 --> 00:33:03,488
[SPEAKER_21]: Motion by Councilor Penta while we're under suspension to take 15-552.

379
00:33:04,209 --> 00:33:04,969
[SPEAKER_21]: All those in favor?

380
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:05,430
[SPEAKER_21]: Aye.

381
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:07,211
[SPEAKER_21]: Opposed?

382
00:33:07,231 --> 00:33:08,492
[SPEAKER_21]: 15-552 offered by Councilor Penta.

383
00:33:09,212 --> 00:33:12,675
[SPEAKER_21]: Resolved that the 5 High Street building be discussed.

384
00:33:12,695 --> 00:33:13,115
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor?

385
00:33:13,675 --> 00:33:23,122
[SPEAKER_29]: If anybody were to go to Medford Square and just look at the 5 High Street building that's there now, they've had scaffolding and staging there for well over in excess of three months.

386
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,901
[SPEAKER_29]: It's an absolute disgrace.

387
00:33:25,041 --> 00:33:25,922
[SPEAKER_29]: It's an eyesore.

388
00:33:26,222 --> 00:33:28,444
[SPEAKER_29]: It's a public health and it's a public safety issue.

389
00:33:29,265 --> 00:33:30,886
[SPEAKER_29]: This is what I don't understand.

390
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:39,553
[SPEAKER_29]: How long does it take for something like that to stay there before it causes a real harm and a real problem to the people within this community?

391
00:33:40,053 --> 00:33:42,295
[SPEAKER_29]: The owner of the property should be held accountable.

392
00:33:42,695 --> 00:33:43,996
[SPEAKER_29]: It's been like that for three months.

393
00:33:44,517 --> 00:33:45,217
[SPEAKER_29]: There's no work.

394
00:33:45,257 --> 00:33:48,400
[SPEAKER_29]: There has been no work that's been done other than putting up the scaffolding.

395
00:33:49,057 --> 00:33:50,658
[SPEAKER_29]: And nobody knows what the reason is.

396
00:33:50,938 --> 00:33:52,398
[SPEAKER_29]: It surrounds the entire building.

397
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:58,241
[SPEAKER_29]: If surrounding the entire building and the parapet has a problem, well, there's no work that's been done on it.

398
00:33:59,061 --> 00:34:03,483
[SPEAKER_29]: I just think it's unfair to every other business person that does what they're supposed to do in the square.

399
00:34:03,783 --> 00:34:07,544
[SPEAKER_29]: We just had a conversation out tonight of putting a massage parlor on Riverside Avenue.

400
00:34:07,864 --> 00:34:12,286
[SPEAKER_29]: And that's as bad as looking at a parapet because, again, it serves no particular purpose.

401
00:34:12,606 --> 00:34:16,127
[SPEAKER_29]: It offers no intrinsic value to the community of Medford.

402
00:34:16,147 --> 00:34:17,708
[SPEAKER_29]: It absolutely is an eyesight.

403
00:34:18,364 --> 00:34:23,405
[SPEAKER_29]: And, as I said, it's a public safety, health, and a building department issue.

404
00:34:23,785 --> 00:34:25,345
[SPEAKER_29]: I've seen people walk underneath that.

405
00:34:25,405 --> 00:34:28,386
[SPEAKER_29]: I saw it today — yesterday, when I was walking, a lady with a baby carriage.

406
00:34:29,006 --> 00:34:34,767
[SPEAKER_29]: And she had to move her baby carriage out from under because, unfortunately, the other lady who was walking down was in a walker.

407
00:34:35,347 --> 00:34:42,848
[SPEAKER_29]: And, you know, so that was nice of her to do that, but there should have been no reason for her to do that because she had to go out underneath it and then bring herself back in.

408
00:34:43,348 --> 00:34:47,709
[SPEAKER_29]: So I'm asking, Mr. President, that our building department find out who that owner is immediately.

409
00:34:48,207 --> 00:34:49,507
[SPEAKER_29]: and find out what the reason is.

410
00:34:49,607 --> 00:34:55,868
[SPEAKER_29]: And if no work is being done there, then take that scaffolding down because it's serving absolutely no purpose at all.

411
00:34:56,609 --> 00:35:01,009
[SPEAKER_29]: And it's just absolutely making Medford Square look exactly what people are saying it is.

412
00:35:01,529 --> 00:35:02,990
[SPEAKER_29]: It's a no man's land town.

413
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:04,310
[SPEAKER_29]: It offers nothing.

414
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:05,470
[SPEAKER_29]: It shows you nothing.

415
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:09,851
[SPEAKER_29]: And I don't want that to be an example of what we're offering in Medford Square.

416
00:35:12,852 --> 00:35:14,932
[SPEAKER_29]: Roll call vote and have that vote to the building commissioner.

417
00:35:15,783 --> 00:35:21,091
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion of Councillor Penter that this be a roll call and support call of the roll, please.

418
00:35:21,752 --> 00:35:31,566
[SPEAKER_16]: Councillor Camuso.

419
00:35:31,766 --> 00:35:32,027
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

420
00:35:33,873 --> 00:35:36,754
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

421
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:37,234
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

422
00:35:38,615 --> 00:35:38,935
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

423
00:35:39,775 --> 00:35:40,035
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

424
00:35:41,175 --> 00:35:41,515
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

425
00:35:41,776 --> 00:35:46,617
[SPEAKER_21]: The vote of the seven in the affirmative motion passes.

426
00:35:47,177 --> 00:36:00,201
[SPEAKER_11]: Counselor Camuso while we're under suspension, I'd like to move paper 15 four six zero off the table on the motion of a consulate Camuso to accept paper 15

427
00:36:01,702 --> 00:36:04,904
[SPEAKER_21]: 15-460 out of committee of the whole.

428
00:36:04,924 --> 00:36:10,507
[SPEAKER_21]: 15-460 was the budget presented to the council on May 8th, 2015.

429
00:36:10,627 --> 00:36:12,508
[SPEAKER_21]: It had been tabled.

430
00:36:13,648 --> 00:36:17,610
[SPEAKER_21]: It had been taken off the table, sent into committee of the whole for discussion.

431
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:21,552
[SPEAKER_21]: We've had extensive discussions on it.

432
00:36:22,173 --> 00:36:27,255
[SPEAKER_21]: And now we have before us the budget director to make the presentation.

433
00:36:28,015 --> 00:36:28,976
[SPEAKER_21]: Madam budget director.

434
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:31,231
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Mr. President.

435
00:36:33,032 --> 00:36:42,997
[SPEAKER_23]: First, I'd like to say that on behalf of the mayor, I am moving to amend this paper to change certain of the lines.

436
00:36:44,338 --> 00:36:50,601
[SPEAKER_23]: The budget for OCD slash boards to be reduced from 181 666 to 175 666 for personnel.

437
00:36:56,223 --> 00:37:01,545
[SPEAKER_23]: Ordinary expenses remain the same and the total for OCD boards would be $249,247.

438
00:37:02,105 --> 00:37:10,509
[SPEAKER_23]: The Hormel Commission personnel was inadvertently included in that budget when it should have been in the DPW.

439
00:37:11,509 --> 00:37:14,891
[SPEAKER_23]: So I do the opposite amendment.

440
00:37:15,051 --> 00:37:17,892
[SPEAKER_23]: Increase the non-enterprise division for public works.

441
00:37:19,299 --> 00:37:19,879
[SPEAKER_23]: to $2,000,902,147 from $2,000,896,747.

442
00:37:19,939 --> 00:37:21,880
[SPEAKER_23]: Expenses remain the same.

443
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:25,801
[SPEAKER_23]: Total budget for public works, non-enterprise division, $9,000,286,483.

444
00:37:25,941 --> 00:37:29,542
[SPEAKER_23]: In addition, the mayor is increasing the library personnel budget to $1,000,003,157

445
00:37:47,885 --> 00:37:54,428
[SPEAKER_23]: from $798,157 and the expenses from $313,066 to $359,391 for a total for the library of $1,362,548, which brings the total budget for the city to $33 million

446
00:38:13,293 --> 00:38:14,213
[SPEAKER_23]: $336,324 for personnel.

447
00:38:14,233 --> 00:38:14,793
[SPEAKER_23]: $69,365,121 for expenses.

448
00:38:14,853 --> 00:38:15,533
[SPEAKER_23]: For a total of $102,701,445.

449
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:17,214
[SPEAKER_23]: The school budget remains the same at $52,933,000.

450
00:38:17,334 --> 00:38:18,274
[SPEAKER_23]: For a grand total of $155,634,445.

451
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:45,801
[SPEAKER_21]: So that is the budget that's presented to us.

452
00:38:46,161 --> 00:38:46,361
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes.

453
00:38:46,802 --> 00:38:51,205
[SPEAKER_21]: Motion for approval on the motion, uh, of councilor Camuso for approval.

454
00:38:54,268 --> 00:38:55,189
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Caraviello.

455
00:38:55,469 --> 00:39:05,897
[SPEAKER_28]: Mr. President, I'd like to amend that motion of approval, uh, with the provision that, uh, all the councilor's questions that were not answered this evening be answered before by next week's meeting.

456
00:39:06,598 --> 00:39:12,643
[SPEAKER_21]: So that, uh, the motion of approval is conditioned upon, uh, receiving the answers for all understanding papers,

457
00:39:13,073 --> 00:39:20,296
[SPEAKER_21]: from department heads that were requested from the council and committee for the assessment of their operations.

458
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:20,936
[SPEAKER_21]: By next week.

459
00:39:21,216 --> 00:39:21,956
[SPEAKER_21]: By next week.

460
00:39:22,757 --> 00:39:26,878
[SPEAKER_21]: On that amendment, Madam Vice President.

461
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,019
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor DelaRusso.

462
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:38,183
[SPEAKER_07]: I have comments with regards to the actual budget, but I think one of the main issues is that we do not have all the answers to our questions.

463
00:39:38,303 --> 00:39:39,283
[SPEAKER_07]: I know there are

464
00:39:39,898 --> 00:39:46,421
[SPEAKER_07]: There was five department heads that were not able to answer the questions we had asked.

465
00:39:46,481 --> 00:39:49,242
[SPEAKER_07]: We've had multiple, multiple Committee of the Whole meetings.

466
00:39:49,442 --> 00:39:54,905
[SPEAKER_07]: We've gone hours discussing and asking questions and trying to dissect and figure out answers.

467
00:39:56,065 --> 00:39:57,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Most department heads have been great.

468
00:39:58,066 --> 00:40:03,489
[SPEAKER_07]: School department, which we met with last night at 5.30 to about 8 p.m., did come in and give us

469
00:40:03,982 --> 00:40:08,365
[SPEAKER_07]: and all our answers, but we didn't actually get those until tonight at 5.30.

470
00:40:09,426 --> 00:40:17,792
[SPEAKER_07]: So as of right now, we have our school budget book, we have our budget book, and we got this tonight to review.

471
00:40:17,812 --> 00:40:27,799
[SPEAKER_07]: I know most counselors were trying to read, trying to ask questions, trying to get a grip on what we have, you know, the job that we have at hand.

472
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:31,462
[SPEAKER_07]: I myself was able to read through probably

473
00:40:32,004 --> 00:40:42,487
[SPEAKER_07]: a tenth, maybe an eighth of what was given to me tonight, I don't feel comfortable going forward without reading the rest.

474
00:40:42,547 --> 00:40:50,170
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I didn't even look at the audits that were provided to us, which I thank Louise for, and a number of others.

475
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:55,171
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even know what some of these documents are, so I would like one more week to review it.

476
00:40:55,211 --> 00:41:00,793
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that pushes us into the last Tuesday of the month, but I think that's only fair to

477
00:41:01,867 --> 00:41:06,951
[SPEAKER_07]: the job that we have at hand and the job we have to do for the taxpayers.

478
00:41:08,031 --> 00:41:17,518
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, like I said, now we have four departments that haven't answered our questions, and there are questions that need to be answered with regards to income, revenue.

479
00:41:18,498 --> 00:41:28,906
[SPEAKER_07]: We have the treasure collector wasn't able to get to us yet, get our answers yet, and that's important information, and this is the only way we can hold those questions

480
00:41:31,431 --> 00:41:44,141
[SPEAKER_07]: hold those department heads to the fire to actually answer the questions in a timely manner, which, you know, it's been great so far, but there's just a job that we need to continue to do, and I need to spend a few more hours on this myself.

481
00:41:45,982 --> 00:41:46,823
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would move to table.

482
00:41:49,024 --> 00:41:50,725
[SPEAKER_21]: Is a motion for approval on the floor?

483
00:41:51,306 --> 00:41:53,047
[SPEAKER_21]: Motion to table is undebatable.

484
00:41:54,889 --> 00:42:00,873
[SPEAKER_21]: On the motion of Vice President Longo, current to table, roll call has been requested by Councilor Camuso.

485
00:42:02,217 --> 00:42:04,939
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. Kerlark, please call the roll.

486
00:42:10,701 --> 00:42:11,201
[SPEAKER_21]: To table.

487
00:42:17,664 --> 00:42:19,005
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Camuso?

488
00:42:19,125 --> 00:42:19,365
No.

489
00:42:20,346 --> 00:42:21,286
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Caviello?

490
00:42:21,326 --> 00:42:21,526
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

491
00:42:22,747 --> 00:42:23,327
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Knight?

492
00:42:23,487 --> 00:42:23,907
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

493
00:42:24,808 --> 00:42:25,908
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice President Longo Kern?

494
00:42:26,188 --> 00:42:26,488
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

495
00:42:27,149 --> 00:42:27,829
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Monk?

496
00:42:28,249 --> 00:42:28,509
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

497
00:42:28,909 --> 00:42:29,570
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Penta?

498
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:29,910
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

499
00:42:30,907 --> 00:42:31,708
[SPEAKER_16]: President DelaRusso?

500
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:32,168
[SPEAKER_21]: No.

501
00:42:33,069 --> 00:42:36,951
[SPEAKER_21]: The vote of four in the negative, three in the affirmative.

502
00:42:37,652 --> 00:42:38,913
[SPEAKER_21]: The motion fails.

503
00:42:41,554 --> 00:42:42,955
[SPEAKER_21]: Motion on the floor for approval.

504
00:42:43,015 --> 00:42:43,956
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Camuso.

505
00:42:44,577 --> 00:42:45,217
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Marks.

506
00:42:47,218 --> 00:42:48,219
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Mr. President.

507
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:59,307
[SPEAKER_31]: And as Councilor Wango Kern so eloquently stated, that this body spent countless hours over the last several weeks

508
00:43:00,279 --> 00:43:18,915
[SPEAKER_31]: to meet with department heads, to go through line item by line item the city budget, which if you look at the list of responsibilities a member of the council has, approving the city budget has to be number one on the list.

509
00:43:19,536 --> 00:43:21,718
[SPEAKER_31]: And I take that job very seriously, Mr. President.

510
00:43:22,283 --> 00:43:24,265
[SPEAKER_31]: as I've done for the last several years.

511
00:43:25,285 --> 00:43:31,730
[SPEAKER_31]: And when this body asked questions of department heads, and many of them have responded.

512
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:35,633
[SPEAKER_31]: The superintendent is here tonight, and he gave us a thorough response.

513
00:43:35,673 --> 00:43:45,540
[SPEAKER_31]: He actually met with us last night and had a prepared response for this evening, which was a very quick turnaround, and we thank him for that.

514
00:43:46,261 --> 00:43:50,444
[SPEAKER_31]: However, there still is a number of outstanding questions

515
00:43:51,326 --> 00:44:11,370
[SPEAKER_31]: And I, as one member, did not spend countless hours sitting in a meeting to ask questions and get answers, not on my behalf, but on behalf of every taxpayer in this city that pays a tax bill, and to not get my questions answered, Mr. President.

516
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:18,831
[SPEAKER_31]: And whether it's my question or any other councilor's questions, we should all be united under one front.

517
00:44:19,843 --> 00:44:24,406
[SPEAKER_31]: And we should be saying, we're not going to move forward until we get our questions answered.

518
00:44:24,926 --> 00:44:28,969
[SPEAKER_31]: What message does that send to the administration, to the budget director?

519
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:34,012
[SPEAKER_31]: Not including the current budget director, because she was kind of presented this budget.

520
00:44:35,033 --> 00:44:39,016
[SPEAKER_31]: What message does that send to these department heads and to the administration?

521
00:44:39,656 --> 00:44:40,337
[SPEAKER_31]: We'll meet with them.

522
00:44:41,097 --> 00:44:42,258
[SPEAKER_31]: We'll let them ask questions.

523
00:44:42,718 --> 00:44:43,299
[SPEAKER_31]: But guess what?

524
00:44:44,439 --> 00:44:45,520
[SPEAKER_31]: They're going to vote on the budget.

525
00:44:46,501 --> 00:44:47,661
[SPEAKER_31]: They're going to vote on the budget.

526
00:44:47,681 --> 00:44:48,422
[SPEAKER_31]: Don't worry about it.

527
00:44:49,322 --> 00:45:09,589
[SPEAKER_31]: For instance, Mr. President, when Council on Aging was present in the room, and many members behind this reeling thanked the director for the job she's doing, and some of us asked the director, what could you use in your program across the street in the senior center?

528
00:45:10,269 --> 00:45:16,151
[SPEAKER_31]: And it was mentioned, it was my resolution, asking about programming, and the director stated that

529
00:45:16,501 --> 00:45:28,748
[SPEAKER_31]: The only programming money that she gets to run the many, many events that our seniors take advantage of across the street, the ones around election time that we all attend to make sure we're there.

530
00:45:30,209 --> 00:45:31,290
[SPEAKER_31]: We asked, what can we do?

531
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:33,851
[SPEAKER_31]: And the program director said, you know what?

532
00:45:33,991 --> 00:45:36,853
[SPEAKER_31]: Programming is always at the top of the list.

533
00:45:37,473 --> 00:45:38,294
[SPEAKER_31]: The seniors love it.

534
00:45:39,122 --> 00:45:52,130
[SPEAKER_31]: maybe some more outreach, and we offered a resolve to the budget to allocate $5,000, earmarked $5,000, to senior programming in the senior center.

535
00:45:53,391 --> 00:45:56,073
[SPEAKER_31]: And it was supported wholeheartedly by the council.

536
00:45:56,713 --> 00:46:02,657
[SPEAKER_31]: The response we got back from the administration, surprise, surprise, we'll take it under advisement.

537
00:46:04,412 --> 00:46:15,796
[SPEAKER_31]: Now, the mayor, when he received 300 emails regarding the library not receiving its accreditation, somehow found $250,000 like it fell out of the sky.

538
00:46:16,656 --> 00:46:20,958
[SPEAKER_31]: He said that there was a project being done in the community and we're going to reap the revenue from the project.

539
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:25,299
[SPEAKER_31]: But he was able to locate a quarter of a million dollars, Mr. President, through that asset.

540
00:46:26,419 --> 00:46:29,701
[SPEAKER_31]: But, you know, this to me was a small request.

541
00:46:30,201 --> 00:46:32,802
[SPEAKER_31]: It was something to recognize the seniors in our community.

542
00:46:34,252 --> 00:46:50,096
[SPEAKER_31]: And it was to let the administration know, like we did last year with the library bathroom, we allocated $10,000 to the library bathroom so they could do some repairs to the deplorable condition of the bathrooms in the library.

543
00:46:50,677 --> 00:47:00,239
[SPEAKER_31]: A few years back, we had a separate line item put in for the Method Arts Council, a first ever in this city's history to create a line item budget to support the arts.

544
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:02,440
[SPEAKER_31]: And now we're asking

545
00:47:02,803 --> 00:47:06,506
[SPEAKER_31]: What can we do for our seniors to add some programming in the senior center?

546
00:47:06,746 --> 00:47:08,307
[SPEAKER_31]: So that's one issue, Mr. President.

547
00:47:08,687 --> 00:47:21,396
[SPEAKER_31]: A vote here tonight for this budget flies in the face, Mr. President, of everything we said in that room a couple of weeks ago or a week ago about supporting programming for the seniors.

548
00:47:21,837 --> 00:47:26,060
[SPEAKER_31]: Now, all of a sudden, you know, I heard members say, I'm not going to hold up a budget for that.

549
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:29,302
[SPEAKER_31]: Well, I didn't hear that the other night when the director was in there.

550
00:47:30,023 --> 00:47:31,924
[SPEAKER_31]: But now we're not going to hold up a program for that.

551
00:47:33,518 --> 00:47:35,780
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm willing to hold up a program for that, Mr. President.

552
00:47:36,001 --> 00:47:41,925
[SPEAKER_31]: And I'm willing to hold up a budget, like I've done in the past, based on my beliefs, Mr. President.

553
00:47:43,126 --> 00:47:44,167
[SPEAKER_31]: A couple of other issues.

554
00:47:45,168 --> 00:47:49,051
[SPEAKER_31]: This was brought up, I believe, Council Vice President Lungo Kern.

555
00:47:49,432 --> 00:47:58,539
[SPEAKER_31]: We asked if we can get a report back on the condition of all the repairs that were done in the firehouses.

556
00:47:58,579 --> 00:48:01,942
[SPEAKER_31]: We all know that we bonded several million dollars to repair.

557
00:48:02,341 --> 00:48:03,842
[SPEAKER_31]: firehouses throughout our community.

558
00:48:04,262 --> 00:48:11,306
[SPEAKER_31]: We wanted an update from the OPM manager, Mr. Buckley, regarding the condition.

559
00:48:11,666 --> 00:48:18,330
[SPEAKER_31]: We're getting phone calls and e-mails from firefighters saying that the work that was just done, tile floors are already coming up.

560
00:48:19,191 --> 00:48:27,576
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't know about you, Mr. President, if I just paid thousands of dollars to do a tile floor in my kitchen, I wouldn't be shrugging that off saying, ah, it's not a big deal.

561
00:48:28,236 --> 00:48:29,617
[SPEAKER_31]: I'd be concerned, Mr. President.

562
00:48:30,297 --> 00:48:33,799
[SPEAKER_31]: And I think we all should be concerned behind this reeling that we get an answer on this.

563
00:48:34,259 --> 00:48:36,960
[SPEAKER_31]: So, that's another one that we're waiting for an answer on.

564
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:41,022
[SPEAKER_31]: Point of information, Madam Vice President.

565
00:48:41,162 --> 00:48:43,443
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Council President De La Ruzo.

566
00:48:43,563 --> 00:48:59,030
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry to interrupt you, Councilor Marks, but I just think that one is so important because if we do not, you know, really push for that answer, we're going to lose our time frame with regards to the warranty that is given to the city

567
00:48:59,412 --> 00:49:05,214
[SPEAKER_07]: of one year on the $2 million that the taxpayers paid to improve those fire stations.

568
00:49:05,674 --> 00:49:09,996
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now, not all the work was done correctly.

569
00:49:10,156 --> 00:49:12,437
[SPEAKER_07]: We have an OPM who I believe is retiring.

570
00:49:13,017 --> 00:49:14,277
[SPEAKER_07]: Who is going to oversee that?

571
00:49:14,377 --> 00:49:16,058
[SPEAKER_07]: And we only have until December.

572
00:49:16,758 --> 00:49:25,801
[SPEAKER_07]: That on top of the fact that we have the DPW yard, which we spent almost over $14 million on, and we have a one-year warranty on that.

573
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:27,802
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have questions with regards to who's going to

574
00:49:28,272 --> 00:49:30,654
[SPEAKER_07]: oversee and make sure that that work was done correctly.

575
00:49:31,054 --> 00:49:43,723
[SPEAKER_07]: If we lose that opportunity, if we wait until that warranty is done and over, what are we going to ask the taxpayer two, three years from now for more money to fix the repairs that could have been covered by warranty?

576
00:49:44,423 --> 00:49:50,127
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have those answers, and that's one of the ones that has stuck out for me within the last three weeks.

577
00:49:51,088 --> 00:49:57,232
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like it's $16-plus million on the taxpayer's behalf that we need to fight for answers for.

578
00:49:57,881 --> 00:49:58,201
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

579
00:50:00,442 --> 00:50:01,082
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Marks.

580
00:50:01,422 --> 00:50:02,983
[SPEAKER_31]: I thank my colleague for adding that.

581
00:50:03,003 --> 00:50:04,464
[SPEAKER_31]: That's a very valid point.

582
00:50:06,164 --> 00:50:07,365
[SPEAKER_31]: A few more, Mr. President.

583
00:50:08,485 --> 00:50:13,367
[SPEAKER_31]: Offered by Council Penta, that the Treasurer supply a complete accounting of all revolving accounts.

584
00:50:13,967 --> 00:50:19,490
[SPEAKER_31]: We know how important it is to get up-to-date information on revolving accounts within this community.

585
00:50:20,430 --> 00:50:26,212
[SPEAKER_31]: Offered by Vice President Lungo Kern, the Treasurer supply all income from Hormel, Tufts, Wrights Pond.

586
00:50:28,747 --> 00:50:29,208
[SPEAKER_31]: in the pool.

587
00:50:30,369 --> 00:50:37,835
[SPEAKER_31]: Offered by Council of Penta Auditor Auditor supply any shortfalls in water and sewer projections offered by myself.

588
00:50:38,275 --> 00:50:44,961
[SPEAKER_31]: The Water and Sewer Commission provide the council with water consumption for the last three years on school and municipal buildings.

589
00:50:45,702 --> 00:50:52,628
[SPEAKER_31]: These four have been unanswered to date, Mr President, and I'm sure they're going to take time to put together, but they have been unanswered.

590
00:50:53,817 --> 00:51:00,520
[SPEAKER_31]: Several more, offered by Councilor Caviello that investigate how the square can be brightened up with better lighting.

591
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:05,262
[SPEAKER_31]: That was offered to the head of wires in our community.

592
00:51:05,942 --> 00:51:10,603
[SPEAKER_31]: Offered by Councilor Penta that National Grid address the lack of lighting at the Winthrop Street Rotary.

593
00:51:11,644 --> 00:51:17,346
[SPEAKER_31]: Offered by Councilor Mox that we get a complete cost usage analysis per street light.

594
00:51:17,846 --> 00:51:22,548
[SPEAKER_31]: We found out in that meeting, Mr. President, that we pay a set fee

595
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:26,801
[SPEAKER_31]: no matter if our streetlights are on or off.

596
00:51:27,841 --> 00:51:33,042
[SPEAKER_31]: So you can imagine a city this size if we have, you know, 700 or 800 streetlights that are out.

597
00:51:33,743 --> 00:51:37,363
[SPEAKER_31]: We're still paying a cost for a streetlight that's out.

598
00:51:38,484 --> 00:51:40,404
[SPEAKER_31]: That's very important, because you know who's paying that?

599
00:51:40,984 --> 00:51:42,705
[SPEAKER_31]: Every taxpayer in this community.

600
00:51:43,185 --> 00:51:51,067
[SPEAKER_31]: And if that was at your business or at your home, and you were paying for a light that wasn't working, it's one thing if the light's out and you're not paying for it.

601
00:51:51,087 --> 00:51:52,147
[SPEAKER_31]: You say, I'm not paying for it.

602
00:51:53,050 --> 00:52:05,259
[SPEAKER_31]: but to pay for something that you're not getting use of, and also to address the issues that we have throughout our community with areas that are darkened, that's a concern that needs to be addressed.

603
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:10,063
[SPEAKER_31]: And that's another question that was not answered within the budget.

604
00:52:10,704 --> 00:52:17,189
[SPEAKER_31]: And we were trying to go through all the papers we received from the administration and the questions.

605
00:52:17,849 --> 00:52:21,312
[SPEAKER_31]: I may have skipped over a few, but there were a number of issues

606
00:52:22,225 --> 00:52:24,906
[SPEAKER_31]: that still present with this budget.

607
00:52:25,266 --> 00:52:42,113
[SPEAKER_31]: And I'm not sure how anyone that wants to be financially responsible and be mindful of the taxpayer in this community can support a budget that doesn't represent the questions that were asked, Mr. President, by this legislative body.

608
00:52:43,534 --> 00:52:48,516
[SPEAKER_31]: I would say the most important role of this legislative body is the approving of the budget.

609
00:52:49,497 --> 00:52:54,939
[SPEAKER_31]: And in my opinion, to try to move forward, I realize, you know, there's only a week.

610
00:52:54,979 --> 00:52:58,199
[SPEAKER_31]: We have next Tuesday, and we get a call for an emergency meeting.

611
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:00,940
[SPEAKER_31]: You as the council president, you know the rules and regulations.

612
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:03,241
[SPEAKER_31]: You can call for an emergency meeting at any time.

613
00:53:03,761 --> 00:53:06,522
[SPEAKER_31]: So if we wanted to discuss this Friday, I'm available.

614
00:53:06,822 --> 00:53:07,882
[SPEAKER_31]: Saturday, I'm available.

615
00:53:07,962 --> 00:53:09,142
[SPEAKER_31]: Sunday, I'm available.

616
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:12,083
[SPEAKER_31]: And I'm sure every other member behind this reel is available.

617
00:53:12,523 --> 00:53:17,225
[SPEAKER_31]: So I don't want to hear that there's not enough time and we have to do this on behalf

618
00:53:18,538 --> 00:53:20,639
[SPEAKER_31]: being financially responsible to put out a budget.

619
00:53:20,699 --> 00:53:23,140
[SPEAKER_31]: So, you know, that's a lot of hoss.

620
00:53:24,921 --> 00:53:25,361
[SPEAKER_31]: You know what?

621
00:53:25,901 --> 00:53:31,264
[SPEAKER_31]: And so I would ask, Mr. President, that we take a step back.

622
00:53:32,825 --> 00:53:33,805
[SPEAKER_31]: Let's take a step back.

623
00:53:34,325 --> 00:53:36,026
[SPEAKER_31]: Let's get these questions answered.

624
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:37,747
[SPEAKER_31]: And I'm not against.

625
00:53:37,767 --> 00:53:38,768
[SPEAKER_31]: There's a lot of good things.

626
00:53:38,828 --> 00:53:44,290
[SPEAKER_31]: As the superintendent said, there's a lot of positive things happening on the school side that are reflective in this budget.

627
00:53:44,650 --> 00:53:47,392
[SPEAKER_31]: On the city side, there's a lot of new hirings.

628
00:53:47,432 --> 00:53:48,172
[SPEAKER_31]: We hired someone.

629
00:53:49,056 --> 00:53:52,598
[SPEAKER_31]: for the opiate crisis we have in the community to oversee that.

630
00:53:52,879 --> 00:53:55,500
[SPEAKER_31]: In our community, there's a lot of positive things happening.

631
00:53:56,441 --> 00:53:59,883
[SPEAKER_31]: But that's not just rush through a budget for the sake of rushing it through.

632
00:54:01,103 --> 00:54:03,164
[SPEAKER_31]: We've spent countless hours going through this.

633
00:54:03,605 --> 00:54:04,685
[SPEAKER_31]: Let's wait for the answers.

634
00:54:05,126 --> 00:54:08,347
[SPEAKER_31]: And then at the appropriate time, we'll take a vote one way or another.

635
00:54:08,748 --> 00:54:09,328
[SPEAKER_31]: But that's wait.

636
00:54:09,348 --> 00:54:12,190
[SPEAKER_31]: This is not the appropriate time I would submit to you, Mr. President.

637
00:54:12,330 --> 00:54:12,630
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

638
00:54:14,297 --> 00:54:19,939
[SPEAKER_23]: Mr. President, if I may just address two of the questions or points that were made.

639
00:54:20,399 --> 00:54:26,342
[SPEAKER_23]: The first one with respect to the Council on Aging that was responded to by the mayor that he would take it under advisement.

640
00:54:27,062 --> 00:54:32,785
[SPEAKER_23]: And now I can't remember whether I was here last week or the week before, but I believe I was here.

641
00:54:33,205 --> 00:54:35,185
[SPEAKER_23]: Was it the week before on transfers?

642
00:54:35,546 --> 00:54:41,288
[SPEAKER_23]: The Council on Aging had not fully expended its expense budget, and that was one of the lines.

643
00:54:41,715 --> 00:54:45,116
[SPEAKER_23]: that had a surplus from which we were transferring out of.

644
00:54:45,376 --> 00:54:47,217
[SPEAKER_23]: And I just want to remind the council of that.

645
00:54:48,077 --> 00:54:51,038
[SPEAKER_23]: The second thing is regarding the one-year warranty.

646
00:54:52,278 --> 00:55:02,441
[SPEAKER_23]: The fire stations I have requested that I get a list of any items at the fire stations that may not be working properly.

647
00:55:02,821 --> 00:55:09,503
[SPEAKER_23]: The fire station project was closed last December, so the renovations were accepted by the city.

648
00:55:10,207 --> 00:55:23,871
[SPEAKER_23]: And this is the warranty period for any item that might need further either repairs or one of the common issues are temperature controls need to be adjusted during the course of the year.

649
00:55:24,151 --> 00:55:29,873
[SPEAKER_23]: And I have requested that a list of any issues at any of the fire stations be provided with me.

650
00:55:31,134 --> 00:55:35,635
[SPEAKER_23]: I would not hope that we would let a one-year warranty period pass without addressing the issues.

651
00:55:36,135 --> 00:55:38,656
[SPEAKER_23]: The DPW, we have not

652
00:55:39,175 --> 00:55:41,276
[SPEAKER_21]: Point of clarification, Madam Vice President.

653
00:55:41,876 --> 00:55:42,296
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

654
00:55:42,736 --> 00:55:43,916
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, President Del Rosso.

655
00:55:43,936 --> 00:55:47,177
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand what you're saying, Louise.

656
00:55:47,277 --> 00:55:55,279
[SPEAKER_07]: But one issue that was brought up with regards to the one-year warranty is we asked the chief himself, who is inspecting these?

657
00:55:55,759 --> 00:55:57,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Who is trying to get this work repaired?

658
00:55:57,879 --> 00:55:59,640
[SPEAKER_07]: And he said, well, that's on me.

659
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:01,280
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's the issue.

660
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:04,141
[SPEAKER_07]: So I understand you asked somebody to do it, but who did you ask?

661
00:56:04,421 --> 00:56:08,122
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's unacceptable to ask the fire chief, who has all his

662
00:56:08,625 --> 00:56:20,372
[SPEAKER_07]: was preparing a budget the last probably few weeks who has personnel issues and issues galore, I'm sure, has a full-time job to go in and say whether or not a floor was done incorrectly.

663
00:56:20,733 --> 00:56:25,716
[SPEAKER_07]: We have no idea if somebody's going to be hired, if the OPM is going to stay on board.

664
00:56:26,737 --> 00:56:27,737
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what we need to know.

665
00:56:27,777 --> 00:56:38,444
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to know that the mayor's office is going to, whether it's hire or appoint the proper personnel to go in and inspect each one of these jobs

666
00:56:38,797 --> 00:56:44,121
[SPEAKER_07]: make sure it's done right, and hold the contractors responsible, because that should not be the fire chief's job.

667
00:56:44,521 --> 00:56:45,682
[SPEAKER_07]: And we haven't got that answer.

668
00:56:46,782 --> 00:56:47,343
[SPEAKER_07]: We just haven't.

669
00:56:47,783 --> 00:56:55,528
[SPEAKER_07]: It's $2 million that, whether it's half the work that was done wrong or a quarter or, you know, 10 percent, that's hundreds of thousands of dollars.

670
00:56:55,568 --> 00:56:58,090
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a floor that's completely broken, A.C.

671
00:56:58,330 --> 00:57:00,912
[SPEAKER_07]: that does not work in one fire station.

672
00:57:01,212 --> 00:57:05,955
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a whole host list of issues, because not only did we have the fire chief there, but we also had

673
00:57:06,418 --> 00:57:09,860
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, the head of the union there with his people.

674
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,441
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're speaking out.

675
00:57:11,582 --> 00:57:13,963
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's something that needs to be fixed.

676
00:57:14,043 --> 00:57:19,507
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to make sure that $2 million was done, all the jobs were done accordingly.

677
00:57:19,947 --> 00:57:24,711
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we have this six-month warranty, we need to take advantage of that.

678
00:57:24,931 --> 00:57:33,997
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if the fire chief comes back and says he needs a new floor two years from now, whether I'm on the council or any of us are on the council, I'm going to lose it.

679
00:57:34,485 --> 00:57:37,406
[SPEAKER_07]: I will lose it for the taxpayer's behalf.

680
00:57:37,466 --> 00:57:38,026
[SPEAKER_07]: I will lose it.

681
00:57:38,367 --> 00:57:39,127
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just not fair.

682
00:57:39,167 --> 00:57:39,747
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not right.

683
00:57:40,047 --> 00:57:47,950
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's something that we need to know who's going to go into that fire station, who's going to go into the DPW yard, and make sure things are done correctly.

684
00:57:48,691 --> 00:57:52,072
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're asking for the personnel is the question?

685
00:57:53,153 --> 00:57:59,635
[SPEAKER_07]: I think my question is, is somebody from the building department, are we going to hire a new OPM, who is going to do it, and when?

686
00:57:59,715 --> 00:58:01,676
[SPEAKER_07]: We have six months left with the fire station.

687
00:58:02,246 --> 00:58:07,368
[SPEAKER_07]: little less than one year for the DPW yard, which is millions and millions of dollars of work.

688
00:58:08,029 --> 00:58:13,131
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just don't want to have to pay for any of that work all over again, two, three, four, five years down the road.

689
00:58:13,671 --> 00:58:16,072
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, taxes go up every year.

690
00:58:16,092 --> 00:58:20,434
[SPEAKER_07]: I always ask that we don't tax to the max.

691
00:58:20,514 --> 00:58:21,695
[SPEAKER_07]: It never happens.

692
00:58:21,775 --> 00:58:23,055
[SPEAKER_07]: I can never get the four votes.

693
00:58:23,155 --> 00:58:31,939
[SPEAKER_07]: But we at least, if we're still going to tax the max, then we at least, and we're going to go out to bond for these projects, we at least owe the taxpayer.

694
00:58:33,193 --> 00:58:48,300
[SPEAKER_07]: the word to say that we've gone out, we've reviewed all the work, it's done to the liking, we have A, B, C, and D out back to the contractor asking them to fix the floor, the air conditioning, everything that's done wrong, we want it fixed and we want it fixed before the warranty's up.

695
00:58:50,921 --> 00:58:51,801
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Consola.

696
00:58:52,562 --> 00:58:57,884
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think the budget director has gotten the point.

697
00:58:58,124 --> 00:58:58,344
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes?

698
00:58:59,645 --> 00:59:00,005
[SPEAKER_23]: I have.

699
00:59:00,925 --> 00:59:01,245
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

700
00:59:01,525 --> 00:59:03,567
[SPEAKER_21]: Point of information, Councilor Garaviello.

701
00:59:03,687 --> 00:59:04,347
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Mr. President.

702
00:59:04,367 --> 00:59:15,154
[SPEAKER_28]: You know, um, a lot of these, a lot of council members concerns and they're not necessarily budget concerns, but, uh, it's because we don't have a clerk of the works that oversees these things.

703
00:59:15,555 --> 00:59:18,436
[SPEAKER_28]: And that's something that's been needed in this community for a long time.

704
00:59:19,057 --> 00:59:20,358
[SPEAKER_21]: And we asked that as part of that.

705
00:59:20,438 --> 00:59:23,680
[SPEAKER_28]: I know we did ask for that, but again, that's, that's been, that's part of the problem.

706
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:25,181
[SPEAKER_28]: That's it's not Louisa's fault.

707
00:59:25,221 --> 00:59:28,483
[SPEAKER_28]: It's not the, but it's an administration, uh, fault.

708
00:59:29,030 --> 00:59:30,010
[SPEAKER_28]: We don't have that precedent.

709
00:59:30,350 --> 00:59:30,671
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

710
00:59:30,711 --> 00:59:30,891
[SPEAKER_28]: Ms.

711
00:59:31,271 --> 00:59:32,711
[SPEAKER_28]: Miller.

712
00:59:32,751 --> 00:59:33,471
[SPEAKER_23]: I know.

713
00:59:33,711 --> 00:59:34,892
[SPEAKER_23]: I just want to clarify again.

714
00:59:34,932 --> 00:59:38,433
[SPEAKER_23]: The construction project had a project manager.

715
00:59:38,973 --> 00:59:41,233
[SPEAKER_23]: The project manager oversaw the project.

716
00:59:41,713 --> 00:59:42,854
[SPEAKER_23]: There was a closeout.

717
00:59:42,894 --> 00:59:46,295
[SPEAKER_23]: There was a punch list before closeout of the project.

718
00:59:46,695 --> 00:59:53,477
[SPEAKER_23]: So we're not talking about whether or not the project product was acceptable to the city, because the city did accept it.

719
00:59:53,897 --> 00:59:58,478
[SPEAKER_23]: All we're talking about are the issues that arise after construction ends.

720
00:59:59,070 --> 01:00:07,053
[SPEAKER_23]: that may need to be addressed during the one-year warranty period, which we just did, by the way, recently with the science lab.

721
01:00:07,073 --> 01:00:08,754
[SPEAKER_23]: We had our one-year warranty walkthrough.

722
01:00:08,794 --> 01:00:12,836
[SPEAKER_23]: That project is closed out, and any outstanding issues have been closed out.

723
01:00:16,057 --> 01:00:16,797
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Penta.

724
01:00:18,258 --> 01:00:24,341
[SPEAKER_29]: Louise, we just went through a couple of weeks ago a transfer at the end of the year budget of over a million dollars.

725
01:00:25,361 --> 01:00:27,422
[SPEAKER_29]: And you just got through saying a few minutes ago

726
01:00:28,415 --> 01:00:35,117
[SPEAKER_29]: that there was some surplus money that was left in the senior account.

727
01:00:36,157 --> 01:00:37,438
[SPEAKER_29]: I believe it's $5,000.

728
01:00:37,798 --> 01:00:38,838
[SPEAKER_29]: Is that what you were looking for?

729
01:00:39,638 --> 01:00:44,340
[SPEAKER_29]: Now, why would the mayor have to go back and say he would take it under advisement when we're talking about $5,000?

730
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:46,060
[SPEAKER_29]: It's a surplus.

731
01:00:47,081 --> 01:00:50,422
[SPEAKER_29]: Why is this even being brought up, point number one, as a discussion?

732
01:00:50,542 --> 01:00:51,362
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't understand it.

733
01:00:51,942 --> 01:00:55,403
[SPEAKER_29]: Because again, to transfer a million dollars at the end of the year,

734
01:00:55,722 --> 01:00:56,703
[SPEAKER_29]: It isn't just this year.

735
01:00:56,943 --> 01:00:57,824
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, this is new to you.

736
01:00:57,864 --> 01:01:05,970
[SPEAKER_29]: This is your first year here in the city of Memphis, but this seems to have been a generic issue each and every year transfer of all this money of all this money.

737
01:01:06,670 --> 01:01:14,916
[SPEAKER_29]: And for the first time this year, the department heads have been really been honest and maybe they're coming out of their shell to tell us how they really feel.

738
01:01:15,377 --> 01:01:16,818
[SPEAKER_29]: Now you've been there to hear it and you will see it.

739
01:01:17,298 --> 01:01:20,841
[SPEAKER_29]: And I asked you on every one of the department heads to tell us your wishlist.

740
01:01:21,201 --> 01:01:22,582
[SPEAKER_29]: This is what this council has asked for.

741
01:01:23,124 --> 01:01:26,526
[SPEAKER_29]: a wish list of each department head before we get the budget so we could understand it.

742
01:01:27,406 --> 01:01:30,507
[SPEAKER_29]: And some of them said they never met, and some of them said they did meet.

743
01:01:31,428 --> 01:01:35,590
[SPEAKER_29]: And you were honest enough to say in a couple of them, you met with them on the day of the budget hearing.

744
01:01:36,390 --> 01:01:43,193
[SPEAKER_29]: And you were also honest enough when the question was asked of you, the way the budget was presented, would you present the budget in the same fashion?

745
01:01:43,233 --> 01:01:44,133
[SPEAKER_29]: And your answer was no.

746
01:01:44,914 --> 01:01:45,794
[SPEAKER_29]: And I appreciate that.

747
01:01:46,574 --> 01:01:52,017
[SPEAKER_29]: So taking that and putting that all together and listening to two department heads in particular, engineer,

748
01:01:52,571 --> 01:01:53,152
[SPEAKER_29]: and the library.

749
01:01:53,892 --> 01:01:56,454
[SPEAKER_29]: Both of them had made requests, very simple requests.

750
01:01:58,276 --> 01:02:02,019
[SPEAKER_29]: Let's take the engineering office.

751
01:02:02,659 --> 01:02:17,391
[SPEAKER_29]: Four people using one phone, a desk that all they want upstairs so they could work on it, file cabinets, and an integrated technology system to the computer, a $30,000 hit, and they were told no.

752
01:02:18,112 --> 01:02:20,574
[SPEAKER_29]: And when the question was asked in the engineering department,

753
01:02:21,222 --> 01:02:23,023
[SPEAKER_29]: Did you ever present that to the budget director?

754
01:02:23,063 --> 01:02:24,704
[SPEAKER_29]: Not you, the former budget director.

755
01:02:24,724 --> 01:02:25,344
[SPEAKER_29]: She said yes.

756
01:02:25,744 --> 01:02:26,764
[SPEAKER_29]: And she said how many times?

757
01:02:27,245 --> 01:02:28,065
[SPEAKER_29]: Four years in a row.

758
01:02:29,045 --> 01:02:32,087
[SPEAKER_29]: And she just happened to have two of those years with her.

759
01:02:32,847 --> 01:02:36,189
[SPEAKER_29]: And she was told by the then budget director, no, you could not put it in.

760
01:02:37,269 --> 01:02:47,514
[SPEAKER_29]: When the gentleman who was the library director was asked the same question on his wish list, he said for the last four years he had been making this presentation to the budget director.

761
01:02:47,954 --> 01:02:50,095
[SPEAKER_29]: And she told him, no, you cannot put it in.

762
01:02:51,093 --> 01:02:54,494
[SPEAKER_29]: Now, he's a little bit different than her, because he doesn't like confrontation.

763
01:02:54,794 --> 01:02:58,654
[SPEAKER_29]: And he'll probably tow the line, because he knows that the mayor is his boss.

764
01:02:59,234 --> 01:03:02,035
[SPEAKER_29]: But I'll compliment the engineer, because she did turn around.

765
01:03:02,435 --> 01:03:13,797
[SPEAKER_29]: And she was a little bit upset, because you can't run an office with four people using one phone, not have a file cabinet that's acceptable to hold the documents, a working station, and to have some type of computer.

766
01:03:14,617 --> 01:03:20,158
[SPEAKER_29]: Now, I think when Mr. Moki was here, and he's in charge of the building department, he had asked for something, again,

767
01:03:20,790 --> 01:03:27,454
[SPEAKER_29]: I think it was $30,000, $40,000, and that's to integrate the entire system so people could jump onto it for the purposes of reviewing it.

768
01:03:28,355 --> 01:03:32,217
[SPEAKER_29]: These are the working instruments that these department heads need.

769
01:03:33,158 --> 01:03:46,947
[SPEAKER_29]: And when you turn around and try to explain to the taxpayer, you have $6.5 million in surplus, and we have $7.5 million, $7.5 million in our water and sewer enterprise account because we're trying to stay financially stable.

770
01:03:47,567 --> 01:03:48,808
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, I'm going to lead into the

771
01:03:49,501 --> 01:03:55,824
[SPEAKER_29]: report, the 2014 report ending by our outside consultant that says the following.

772
01:03:56,505 --> 01:04:08,331
[SPEAKER_29]: The city does not have a formal investment policy that limits investment maturities as a means of managing its exposure to fair value losses arising from increasing interest rates.

773
01:04:08,892 --> 01:04:14,835
[SPEAKER_29]: Now, we hear all around here that this city is so well maintained in its bond rating and what it goes out to do.

774
01:04:15,515 --> 01:04:18,677
[SPEAKER_29]: Now, here's an outside auditing company and says we have no

775
01:04:19,210 --> 01:04:23,032
[SPEAKER_29]: formal investment policy to protect us in that particular area.

776
01:04:24,213 --> 01:04:25,394
[SPEAKER_29]: So who are we to believe?

777
01:04:26,354 --> 01:04:32,438
[SPEAKER_29]: The city administration or the outside consultant, Melanson and Heath, who does the audit in that particular part?

778
01:04:32,918 --> 01:04:33,378
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't know.

779
01:04:33,958 --> 01:04:39,061
[SPEAKER_29]: We've asked for an update on the parking tickets from Republic in the abatements that have come forward.

780
01:04:39,522 --> 01:04:40,922
[SPEAKER_29]: We still haven't gotten that.

781
01:04:41,523 --> 01:04:46,005
[SPEAKER_29]: We haven't gotten a report back of whether, in fact, there is going to be a water and sewer rate increase.

782
01:04:46,646 --> 01:04:48,927
[SPEAKER_29]: We got a report back from the Water and Sewer Commission

783
01:04:49,515 --> 01:04:57,099
[SPEAKER_29]: indicating the amount of usage that's gone up and the amount of usage in their wastewater treatment that's gone up.

784
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:03,183
[SPEAKER_29]: We still don't have anything that's definitive that's going to tell us that are we going to get an increase or not.

785
01:05:03,903 --> 01:05:07,545
[SPEAKER_29]: Let's go to the fire stations that both Councilor Marks and Councilor Longo-Kern has alluded to.

786
01:05:07,565 --> 01:05:11,267
[SPEAKER_29]: $2 million is not chump change.

787
01:05:12,368 --> 01:05:16,450
[SPEAKER_29]: $2 million represents the taxpayers' money being put into buildings

788
01:05:16,927 --> 01:05:22,008
[SPEAKER_29]: to make sure that firefighters in the respective houses that they're in have what they need.

789
01:05:23,228 --> 01:05:29,670
[SPEAKER_29]: On that particular night, when I believe the gentleman who was the president of the firefighters was here, he indicated he had a difference of opinion with the chief.

790
01:05:29,710 --> 01:05:31,530
[SPEAKER_29]: And that's OK, having a difference of opinion.

791
01:05:32,270 --> 01:05:38,611
[SPEAKER_29]: But the difference of opinion should not have been had there before the council, because if we had this wish list to discuss it, we'd have this opportunity.

792
01:05:39,251 --> 01:05:41,672
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't think the question asked by Councilor Langel-Kern,

793
01:05:42,817 --> 01:05:46,398
[SPEAKER_29]: should get anybody upset, because that's just good project management.

794
01:05:46,438 --> 01:05:53,961
[SPEAKER_29]: And since we don't have a clerk of the works, who's going to be the project manager on any of these jobs or all of these jobs once the things go wrong?

795
01:05:54,441 --> 01:06:03,024
[SPEAKER_29]: We built a new fire station in South Medford, and I think the building didn't even make it through its first year when they had leaks and air conditioning and heating problems.

796
01:06:03,464 --> 01:06:07,186
[SPEAKER_29]: And that's a multimillion-dollar building, not a $2 million building.

797
01:06:07,946 --> 01:06:11,367
[SPEAKER_29]: So my colleagues are right making these questions and asking these questions.

798
01:06:11,818 --> 01:06:24,508
[SPEAKER_29]: Because why should we as the tax, strike that, why should we as representatives of the taxpayers have to come back at a later date to say we got a bond for this and we have to bond for that, or we have to pay for this and pay for that, when in fact we really shouldn't have to.

799
01:06:25,469 --> 01:06:31,954
[SPEAKER_29]: You know, we just got through building a new public works building, a brand new public works building for approximately $14 million.

800
01:06:32,595 --> 01:06:39,040
[SPEAKER_29]: And the reason why the old building fell apart is because the city had no maintenance program for any of its buildings.

801
01:06:39,635 --> 01:06:47,360
[SPEAKER_29]: The reason why the library got itself in so much trouble is because, A, the library director was denied what he needed for money.

802
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:55,765
[SPEAKER_29]: And number two, how could you take for six years in a row and get a waiver to your certification with the state, which is approximately $225,000 per year?

803
01:06:56,366 --> 01:06:58,707
[SPEAKER_29]: A waiver is only good for maybe one, two years max.

804
01:06:59,328 --> 01:07:01,569
[SPEAKER_29]: And we were really running the string on that one there.

805
01:07:02,149 --> 01:07:08,914
[SPEAKER_29]: And then to turn around and say, we found the money in some kind of a construction development, and we're going to generate that $225,000.

806
01:07:09,784 --> 01:07:11,425
[SPEAKER_29]: That is bull in plain English.

807
01:07:11,865 --> 01:07:27,795
[SPEAKER_29]: When you're sitting on reserves, cash reserves, that are the taxpayers' money of this community, and you can't put a legitimate budget out, line item by line item, that identifies the actual cost of needs, the required cost of needs, that's not a true budget.

808
01:07:28,335 --> 01:07:32,717
[SPEAKER_29]: And I don't think to some degree that this budget that's presented, and it's not your budget that you presented.

809
01:07:32,897 --> 01:07:33,338
[SPEAKER_29]: I know that.

810
01:07:33,678 --> 01:07:38,901
[SPEAKER_29]: I know you walked into this position late on, and I believe when you were asked the question and you answered it honestly,

811
01:07:39,197 --> 01:07:40,918
[SPEAKER_29]: You would not be presenting this type of a budget.

812
01:07:41,298 --> 01:07:42,839
[SPEAKER_29]: It would include the wish list.

813
01:07:42,899 --> 01:07:47,301
[SPEAKER_29]: It would include cost and expenditures, actuals, and it would have everything broken down.

814
01:07:48,001 --> 01:07:51,182
[SPEAKER_29]: We shouldn't have to ask now for these things.

815
01:07:51,723 --> 01:07:56,785
[SPEAKER_29]: We shouldn't have to ask for revolving accounts for expenditures and revenue.

816
01:07:57,485 --> 01:07:58,966
[SPEAKER_29]: That should just come automatically.

817
01:07:59,366 --> 01:08:03,448
[SPEAKER_29]: And boards and commissions, that should have all been presented to us during this budget.

818
01:08:03,888 --> 01:08:06,549
[SPEAKER_29]: Not, well, maybe next year we'll have a representative from each board.

819
01:08:06,950 --> 01:08:07,930
[SPEAKER_29]: It shouldn't work that way.

820
01:08:08,728 --> 01:08:14,951
[SPEAKER_29]: This is the only time of the year when the taxpayers of this community can actually see their tax dollars at work.

821
01:08:15,571 --> 01:08:23,235
[SPEAKER_29]: And for us to be put into a position tonight to vote on something with multiple questions still to be answered is wrong and it's unfair.

822
01:08:23,795 --> 01:08:33,020
[SPEAKER_29]: I'll ask you, Councilor Caviello, with all due respect, if you would withdraw your vote and allow this to sit on the table for a week so we can answer these questions.

823
01:08:33,460 --> 01:08:37,822
[SPEAKER_29]: And then that way, I think we could all be on the same page and we can let our votes fall the way they may be.

824
01:08:38,243 --> 01:08:44,946
[SPEAKER_29]: because I think it's just unfair right now, with so many questions that are still lingering, to have a vote with these still outstanding.

825
01:08:45,486 --> 01:08:47,407
[SPEAKER_29]: So I ask you, with all due respect.

826
01:08:52,249 --> 01:08:53,949
[SPEAKER_28]: Again, I mean, it was just my vote?

827
01:08:54,150 --> 01:08:55,390
[SPEAKER_28]: I mean, was I the only vote that?

828
01:08:57,011 --> 01:08:57,851
[SPEAKER_28]: Vote was four to three.

829
01:08:58,471 --> 01:09:00,312
[SPEAKER_28]: But there was four other people who voted.

830
01:09:00,932 --> 01:09:01,332
[SPEAKER_28]: Pardon me?

831
01:09:01,352 --> 01:09:01,853
[SPEAKER_28]: Mr. President?

832
01:09:02,693 --> 01:09:03,493
[SPEAKER_11]: Counselor Camuso.

833
01:09:06,677 --> 01:09:11,460
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not going to speak for Councilor Caviello, but to specifically ask one councilor to change their vote.

834
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:17,224
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I just, no one's asking me to change my vote or other people that may have voted on the other side.

835
01:09:18,525 --> 01:09:19,546
[SPEAKER_11]: Take the vote and see where it goes.

836
01:09:19,586 --> 01:09:22,027
[SPEAKER_11]: It won't fail because you're voting for it tonight.

837
01:09:22,087 --> 01:09:22,408
[SPEAKER_28]: It's okay.

838
01:09:22,428 --> 01:09:23,728
[SPEAKER_28]: Why can't you wait till next week?

839
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:41,200
[SPEAKER_18]: Ms.

840
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:42,981
[SPEAKER_18]: Miller, do you have anything to add?

841
01:09:43,041 --> 01:09:45,702
[SPEAKER_21]: There's a motion on the table.

842
01:09:46,342 --> 01:09:48,843
[SPEAKER_21]: There's a motion on the floor for approval by Councilor Camuso.

843
01:09:49,243 --> 01:09:54,125
[SPEAKER_21]: A couple of citizens want to speak, but before we do that, Ms.

844
01:09:54,165 --> 01:09:57,886
[SPEAKER_21]: Miller, do you have anything to add to any of the comments that have been made thus?

845
01:09:58,827 --> 01:10:08,390
[SPEAKER_23]: I would just make a general comment that indeed, you know, we will make our best effort to answer all of the outstanding questions and that

846
01:10:08,831 --> 01:10:13,094
[SPEAKER_23]: to the extent that there are questions that are not budget related.

847
01:10:13,114 --> 01:10:20,820
[SPEAKER_23]: I would be happy to discuss all of those items further with the council.

848
01:10:28,406 --> 01:10:29,667
[SPEAKER_32]: My name is Michael Leggero.

849
01:10:29,687 --> 01:10:30,727
[SPEAKER_32]: I live on 18 Pembroke Street.

850
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:38,113
[SPEAKER_32]: It is disturbing the rate and speed at which this budget has moved through these chambers.

851
01:10:39,392 --> 01:10:47,758
[SPEAKER_32]: I've seen all of the members of this council work a number of weeks to try to figure it out, but it's been so compressed to try to get things through.

852
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:57,044
[SPEAKER_32]: To vote on this budget and hope that answers come on the back end is literally putting the cart before the horse.

853
01:10:58,005 --> 01:11:02,869
[SPEAKER_32]: If the answer is literally, oh, we'll work and look into it, the budget is fine.

854
01:11:03,049 --> 01:11:03,589
[SPEAKER_32]: That's an answer.

855
01:11:03,609 --> 01:11:07,632
[SPEAKER_32]: It doesn't have to be a proper answer or an answer that satisfies everyone here.

856
01:11:08,366 --> 01:11:09,726
[SPEAKER_32]: Let's look at our two possibilities.

857
01:11:11,027 --> 01:11:15,848
[SPEAKER_32]: What happens if we don't pass this budget tonight and we look at it next week or we come to an emergency meeting?

858
01:11:16,488 --> 01:11:18,669
[SPEAKER_32]: Medford's not going to fall apart in flames.

859
01:11:19,049 --> 01:11:23,510
[SPEAKER_32]: There are no creditors like those Capital One commercials where the Vikings come off the mountains.

860
01:11:23,910 --> 01:11:24,610
[SPEAKER_32]: It's going to be fine.

861
01:11:24,990 --> 01:11:26,571
[SPEAKER_32]: We're going to survive it for a couple of days.

862
01:11:27,231 --> 01:11:28,131
[SPEAKER_32]: What's the other option?

863
01:11:28,391 --> 01:11:30,592
[SPEAKER_32]: What's the other possibility that this budget is passed?

864
01:11:31,711 --> 01:11:33,652
[SPEAKER_32]: and these answers aren't come about.

865
01:11:34,352 --> 01:11:35,953
[SPEAKER_32]: The fire station falls apart.

866
01:11:36,833 --> 01:11:39,554
[SPEAKER_32]: Lights still don't exist on Medford Square.

867
01:11:40,374 --> 01:11:42,635
[SPEAKER_32]: Our views, our city begins to crumble.

868
01:11:43,796 --> 01:11:51,279
[SPEAKER_32]: I urge you, do not do the easy thing on passing this budget and hoping answers come down the road.

869
01:11:51,939 --> 01:11:53,880
[SPEAKER_32]: Make sure that answers come about now.

870
01:11:54,620 --> 01:11:54,880
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

871
01:11:59,912 --> 01:12:01,913
[SPEAKER_28]: Some of the questions asked are not budget-related.

872
01:12:01,933 --> 01:12:08,195
[SPEAKER_28]: I mean, so that's, you know, not every question that's asked affects the bottom line of the budget.

873
01:12:10,316 --> 01:12:11,557
[SPEAKER_28]: A budget is a moral document.

874
01:12:11,717 --> 01:12:12,477
[SPEAKER_28]: I know what a budget is.

875
01:12:12,877 --> 01:12:13,838
[SPEAKER_32]: I know what a budget is.

876
01:12:13,858 --> 01:12:15,538
[SPEAKER_28]: Direct our questions through the chair.

877
01:12:15,558 --> 01:12:22,161
[SPEAKER_28]: I know what a budget is, and you know our role, what this council can do with this budget.

878
01:12:23,241 --> 01:12:27,643
[SPEAKER_32]: A budget, if money is being allocated to something, and it's not being used properly,

879
01:12:28,067 --> 01:12:30,647
[SPEAKER_32]: The budget is the proper place to discuss those issues.

880
01:12:31,288 --> 01:12:32,488
[SPEAKER_32]: That's what a budget is for.

881
01:12:33,028 --> 01:12:41,550
[SPEAKER_32]: If I spend $100, if I give my wife $1,000 to spend on groceries for the next three weeks, and she comes back only with ice cream.

882
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:43,510
[SPEAKER_28]: Point of information, Counselor Schiaffiello.

883
01:12:44,510 --> 01:12:46,991
[SPEAKER_28]: The budget they represented is not an actual budget.

884
01:12:47,331 --> 01:12:48,531
[SPEAKER_28]: It's a budget summary.

885
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:53,812
[SPEAKER_28]: So it's very hard to vote on a budget that gives us minimal information in general.

886
01:12:54,709 --> 01:12:57,851
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, don't vote on a budget if you don't have the answers to these basic questions.

887
01:12:57,932 --> 01:13:03,256
[SPEAKER_28]: I'll never have the answers because, again, that's not what the budget director before Ms.

888
01:13:03,296 --> 01:13:04,737
[SPEAKER_28]: Miller provided us.

889
01:13:05,097 --> 01:13:13,304
[SPEAKER_28]: This is my fourth time in the budget, and the budget hasn't improved not one bit because it's not presented to us in a proper fashion.

890
01:13:14,845 --> 01:13:16,706
[SPEAKER_28]: And that's the main part of the problem here.

891
01:13:17,227 --> 01:13:21,290
[SPEAKER_32]: With all due respect, Counselor, to have a resolution

892
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:26,524
[SPEAKER_32]: that you'll approve the budget in hope that answers will come.

893
01:13:26,684 --> 01:13:31,128
[SPEAKER_28]: The resolution is conditional.

894
01:13:31,748 --> 01:13:35,912
[SPEAKER_32]: The budget passes on the condition of the responses.

895
01:13:37,013 --> 01:13:39,535
[SPEAKER_32]: What answer would satisfy you if it's, we're working on it?

896
01:13:39,915 --> 01:13:40,836
[SPEAKER_28]: No, that's not an answer.

897
01:13:42,417 --> 01:13:43,618
[SPEAKER_28]: That's not an answer we're working on.

898
01:13:43,678 --> 01:13:44,339
[SPEAKER_28]: Mr. President.

899
01:13:44,879 --> 01:13:45,820
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Camuso.

900
01:13:49,263 --> 01:13:50,864
[SPEAKER_18]: The question before us is for approval.

901
01:13:51,552 --> 01:13:57,716
[SPEAKER_21]: On the motion for approval by Councilor Camuso, as amended by Councilor Caviello.

902
01:13:58,737 --> 01:14:00,938
[SPEAKER_21]: I think there's other people that want to speak here.

903
01:14:03,580 --> 01:14:05,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Doctor, please state your name and address for the record.

904
01:14:05,962 --> 01:14:07,883
[SPEAKER_02]: John Straw, 20 Metcalf Street.

905
01:14:08,804 --> 01:14:14,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, thank you for listening to me, but I'm going to be short and sweet, but I want to resolve this once and for all.

906
01:14:17,093 --> 01:14:26,000
[SPEAKER_02]: The budget as proposed by the mayor, as it has been for 27 years, will be passed as it is proposed.

907
01:14:26,340 --> 01:14:31,705
[SPEAKER_02]: The budget is for $156 million, and this council will pass $156 million.

908
01:14:31,725 --> 01:14:31,705
$155,634,444.

909
01:14:32,966 --> 01:14:34,407
[SPEAKER_02]: That is exactly correct.

910
01:14:40,408 --> 01:14:47,553
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I want to say is whether this council votes for the budget or does not vote for the budget, it will take effect.

911
01:14:47,993 --> 01:14:48,854
[SPEAKER_02]: It always has.

912
01:14:48,994 --> 01:14:49,915
[SPEAKER_02]: And it always will.

913
01:14:50,535 --> 01:14:53,857
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the law we operate under a charter.

914
01:14:53,998 --> 01:15:00,922
[SPEAKER_02]: And the charter says that when the mayor proposes a budget, he does not need the approval of the city council.

915
01:15:01,643 --> 01:15:04,705
[SPEAKER_02]: These counselors who say yes, pass the budget.

916
01:15:05,886 --> 01:15:07,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Either way, the budget will pass.

917
01:15:08,368 --> 01:15:08,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait and see.

918
01:15:09,847 --> 01:15:10,347
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, John.

919
01:15:17,211 --> 01:15:18,932
[SPEAKER_08]: Please state your name and address for the record.

920
01:15:19,112 --> 01:15:19,632
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, good evening.

921
01:15:19,872 --> 01:15:21,553
[SPEAKER_08]: Mark Crowley, 59 Boynton Road.

922
01:15:22,174 --> 01:15:31,659
[SPEAKER_08]: I simply would just find it unbelievable that if there are, in fact, questions that can be answered within a week, I simply have to ask, what is the rush?

923
01:15:32,860 --> 01:15:39,123
[SPEAKER_08]: If these things can be answered and we appropriately can do the due diligence that is necessary to get these questions answered,

924
01:15:39,728 --> 01:15:41,950
[SPEAKER_08]: let's defer, and let's move it on to another week.

925
01:15:43,011 --> 01:15:47,734
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I work by trade as a director of finance for a $300 million software company.

926
01:15:47,814 --> 01:15:49,756
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm responsible for putting budgets together.

927
01:15:50,316 --> 01:15:51,977
[SPEAKER_08]: I take careful consideration.

928
01:15:52,177 --> 01:15:56,481
[SPEAKER_08]: I meet with department heads, much like how you folks have been doing over the past several weeks.

929
01:15:57,141 --> 01:16:01,344
[SPEAKER_08]: I do not give that a green light until all questions have been answered.

930
01:16:01,725 --> 01:16:07,329
[SPEAKER_08]: I am a steward for the shareholders' money, much like how the city council is a steward for the taxpayers' money.

931
01:16:08,184 --> 01:16:18,806
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, I'm sure there's not a resident in this town that wouldn't get into a contract or sign a contract with an individual or a contractor to do their kitchen without asking some appropriate questions.

932
01:16:19,246 --> 01:16:21,407
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a significant investment that a lot of homeowners will do.

933
01:16:22,027 --> 01:16:22,467
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know what?

934
01:16:22,507 --> 01:16:28,328
[SPEAKER_08]: Instead of $50,000, we're using, I think it was $155,032, or whatever the number was there.

935
01:16:28,969 --> 01:16:35,370
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the taxpayers are entitled to the same level of due diligence as we would do ourselves in our own homes.

936
01:16:36,385 --> 01:16:44,962
[SPEAKER_08]: So as it's been noted, the single most important responsibility this council has is to approve the budget of this city.

937
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:53,269
[SPEAKER_08]: to approve the hard-earned dollars, to ensure that those dollars are being spent in the most effective and responsible manner.

938
01:16:53,849 --> 01:16:56,110
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a critical check and balance.

939
01:16:56,130 --> 01:16:59,311
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we talk a lot about the power that this mayor has.

940
01:16:59,351 --> 01:17:00,391
[SPEAKER_08]: He's a strong mayor.

941
01:17:00,971 --> 01:17:07,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the one check and balance that the city council can truly impart is approval of that budget.

942
01:17:08,193 --> 01:17:13,615
[SPEAKER_08]: And if that means taking another week to get some answers, questions, by God, get those answers.

943
01:17:14,575 --> 01:17:14,995
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?

944
01:17:15,416 --> 01:17:15,936
[SPEAKER_08]: What's the rush?

945
01:17:15,976 --> 01:17:17,497
[SPEAKER_08]: I simply ask, what is the intent?

946
01:17:17,798 --> 01:17:19,219
[SPEAKER_08]: Why are we trying to rush it through?

947
01:17:19,879 --> 01:17:20,900
[SPEAKER_08]: What are we trying to hide?

948
01:17:21,620 --> 01:17:22,821
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's take the time.

949
01:17:22,861 --> 01:17:24,262
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's do the due diligence.

950
01:17:24,623 --> 01:17:25,824
[SPEAKER_08]: Get the questions answered.

951
01:17:26,884 --> 01:17:29,246
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, you've invested significant time.

952
01:17:29,266 --> 01:17:37,172
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we've seen what happens when budgets or, more importantly, legislation gets passed, when legislators say, gosh, you know, I didn't have time to read it.

953
01:17:37,893 --> 01:17:40,415
[SPEAKER_08]: Or, you know what, they admit that, you know, I didn't fully understand it.

954
01:17:41,182 --> 01:17:47,884
[SPEAKER_08]: We have collectively understood that we do have the time, we do have the opportunity to read and get some simple questions.

955
01:17:48,124 --> 01:17:57,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe we want all the questions are budget-related, but if there's just one question that's budget-related, well, let's spend that extra week and get that question answered.

956
01:17:57,546 --> 01:17:58,846
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll come back next Tuesday.

957
01:17:59,206 --> 01:18:00,727
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll come back next Saturday night.

958
01:18:00,827 --> 01:18:01,507
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on to my house.

959
01:18:01,527 --> 01:18:02,207
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll have a barbecue.

960
01:18:02,227 --> 01:18:03,767
[SPEAKER_08]: You can improve the budget at my backyard.

961
01:18:04,327 --> 01:18:04,688
[SPEAKER_08]: We can't.

962
01:18:04,708 --> 01:18:05,868
[SPEAKER_08]: You've got that house across the street.

963
01:18:05,928 --> 01:18:06,388
[SPEAKER_08]: That's true.

964
01:18:07,450 --> 01:18:08,310
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to get that one knocked down.

965
01:18:09,071 --> 01:18:12,693
[SPEAKER_08]: So anyways, please, just do the taxpayers a favor.

966
01:18:12,713 --> 01:18:13,914
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't forget favors.

967
01:18:13,974 --> 01:18:26,020
[SPEAKER_08]: Do what you're asked, what you're voted to do, and take the time and be responsible and get the questions asked and come back next week and come back with an intelligent answer and approval to this budget.

968
01:18:26,261 --> 01:18:26,621
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

969
01:18:32,844 --> 01:18:33,345
[SPEAKER_20]: Good evening.

970
01:18:33,425 --> 01:18:33,825
[SPEAKER_20]: Welcome.

971
01:18:33,885 --> 01:18:35,866
[SPEAKER_20]: Please state your name and address for the record, Senator.

972
01:18:37,103 --> 01:18:38,143
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

973
01:18:38,223 --> 01:18:41,405
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm Robert Cappucci of 71 Evans Street.

974
01:18:41,705 --> 01:18:42,725
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a few questions.

975
01:18:44,126 --> 01:18:51,549
[SPEAKER_09]: What department heads failed to give answers to the questions that you asked?

976
01:18:52,309 --> 01:19:00,373
[SPEAKER_21]: If I could, from the chair, explain to you that that has been announced in the remarks of some of the councillors.

977
01:19:04,554 --> 01:19:05,355
[SPEAKER_21]: Point of information.

978
01:19:05,435 --> 01:19:06,295
[SPEAKER_21]: Point of information, Councilor

979
01:19:06,762 --> 01:19:08,002
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, President DelaRusso.

980
01:19:08,582 --> 01:19:11,503
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, some of these answers are complex, and it will take some time.

981
01:19:12,023 --> 01:19:13,563
[SPEAKER_07]: And we met with department heads.

982
01:19:14,643 --> 01:19:19,164
[SPEAKER_07]: We started three and a half weeks ago, and we actually just met with departments last week.

983
01:19:19,244 --> 01:19:19,884
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know.

984
01:19:19,904 --> 01:19:21,465
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not putting blame on anybody.

985
01:19:21,525 --> 01:19:22,765
[SPEAKER_07]: We just haven't got the answers.

986
01:19:22,825 --> 01:19:25,565
[SPEAKER_07]: But we have some electrical questions out there.

987
01:19:26,125 --> 01:19:34,487
[SPEAKER_07]: The treasurer, chief of police, the OPM, which is the operation manager for all the bigger projects that have been done.

988
01:19:35,035 --> 01:19:46,084
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I believe we still have some water and sewer questions left out, because there is a, we have concern there's a deficit in the water and sewer account of almost a million dollars.

989
01:19:47,885 --> 01:19:50,107
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you for your point of information, Madam Vice President.

990
01:19:50,868 --> 01:19:52,189
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

991
01:19:52,329 --> 01:19:59,134
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much, Councilor Longo Kern, for your proposal to table this until next week.

992
01:19:59,255 --> 01:20:03,178
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to thank all the other residents that came before and spoke.

993
01:20:03,238 --> 01:20:04,639
[SPEAKER_09]: I also want to thank Councilors

994
01:20:05,325 --> 01:20:09,086
[SPEAKER_09]: Pinto and Marks for their comments.

995
01:20:10,146 --> 01:20:28,871
[SPEAKER_09]: It's odd to me that city councilors will bring up other issues such as the massage parlors or other things that are going wrong in this city based upon the administration's willingness or not to get a certain thing done.

996
01:20:29,431 --> 01:20:33,672
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the one power that the city council truly has

997
01:20:34,535 --> 01:20:44,225
[SPEAKER_09]: You're not going to have the political will to rise up and make a stand with that and speak on behalf of the voters that put you in office.

998
01:20:44,645 --> 01:20:50,951
[SPEAKER_09]: It's literally beyond my comprehension that you won't do this.

999
01:20:51,432 --> 01:20:57,518
[SPEAKER_09]: November 3rd is Election Day, and elections have consequences.

1000
01:20:57,858 --> 01:20:58,579
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

1001
01:21:03,325 --> 01:21:03,805
[SPEAKER_20]: Good evening.

1002
01:21:03,885 --> 01:21:04,286
[SPEAKER_20]: Welcome.

1003
01:21:04,386 --> 01:21:06,187
[SPEAKER_20]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1004
01:21:06,647 --> 01:21:07,028
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening.

1005
01:21:07,228 --> 01:21:08,709
[SPEAKER_10]: My name is Joseph Villione.

1006
01:21:09,269 --> 01:21:12,311
[SPEAKER_10]: I live at 59 Garfield Avenue in Medford.

1007
01:21:12,391 --> 01:21:22,378
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to also thank all the wonderful speakers, Dr. Starella, man of integrity, Bob Capucci, Mark Crowley, Mr. Ruggiero.

1008
01:21:23,599 --> 01:21:26,141
[SPEAKER_10]: Couldn't say a bit of myself, so I'll keep it very short and sweet.

1009
01:21:27,302 --> 01:21:32,145
[SPEAKER_10]: Excuses are irresponsible from one of the most expensive city councils in the Commonwealth.

1010
01:21:33,568 --> 01:21:37,210
[SPEAKER_10]: Now's the time for Councilor Caraviello to show some strength for his constituents.

1011
01:21:37,951 --> 01:21:40,032
[SPEAKER_10]: The election is 132 days away.

1012
01:21:40,672 --> 01:21:44,014
[SPEAKER_10]: We will vote based on how you councilors do the people's business.

1013
01:21:47,756 --> 01:21:50,038
[SPEAKER_21]: On the motion of Councilor Camuso for approval.

1014
01:21:50,478 --> 01:21:51,018
[SPEAKER_21]: Roll call vote.

1015
01:21:51,339 --> 01:21:52,900
[SPEAKER_21]: Roll call vote has been requested.

1016
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,061
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1017
01:21:56,225 --> 01:21:58,465
[SPEAKER_21]: This paper has been tabled already.

1018
01:21:58,565 --> 01:22:01,326
[SPEAKER_21]: Section 22 cannot be invoked, Madam Vice President.

1019
01:22:01,346 --> 01:22:02,566
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the revised.

1020
01:22:03,046 --> 01:22:04,707
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of information, Mr. President.

1021
01:22:04,967 --> 01:22:06,207
[SPEAKER_21]: It's an amended paper.

1022
01:22:06,747 --> 01:22:07,907
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a revised.

1023
01:22:08,267 --> 01:22:11,788
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, challenge the chair and take a vote.

1024
01:22:15,669 --> 01:22:17,969
[SPEAKER_30]: This is not a new paper.

1025
01:22:19,810 --> 01:22:21,570
[SPEAKER_11]: This has happened many times in the past.

1026
01:22:25,928 --> 01:22:28,410
[SPEAKER_29]: Louise Miller, could you please come to the podium, please?

1027
01:22:33,714 --> 01:22:38,278
[SPEAKER_29]: Did you or did you not give us a revised budget this evening, dollar amounts?

1028
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,081
[SPEAKER_29]: It's revised, correct?

1029
01:22:42,382 --> 01:22:44,103
[SPEAKER_29]: It's not the original one that was submitted.

1030
01:22:44,543 --> 01:22:45,604
[SPEAKER_11]: Point of information, Mr. President.

1031
01:22:45,644 --> 01:22:46,205
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that correct?

1032
01:22:46,225 --> 01:22:47,986
[SPEAKER_11]: Point of information, Councilor Camuso.

1033
01:22:49,167 --> 01:22:53,731
[SPEAKER_11]: If we just go back to the beginning of this meeting, the paper that I took

1034
01:22:55,067 --> 01:23:09,857
[SPEAKER_11]: off of the council calendar was the one from the committee and not the new paper that is on the council agenda that I'm sure later on, if this is acted upon, will be received and placed on file or withdrawn like it has in the past.

1035
01:23:10,677 --> 01:23:15,060
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not speaking for the administration, but is that the intent?

1036
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:19,303
[SPEAKER_29]: Madam Louise, well, the word says revised right up above.

1037
01:23:20,083 --> 01:23:22,964
[SPEAKER_29]: Revised means it's different.

1038
01:23:23,124 --> 01:23:23,905
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a different paper.

1039
01:23:24,045 --> 01:23:27,607
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a different paper.

1040
01:23:27,627 --> 01:23:30,188
[SPEAKER_18]: And we're not discussing the other paper right now.

1041
01:23:30,208 --> 01:23:35,030
[SPEAKER_21]: We're discussing paper 15 460 has been called up.

1042
01:23:36,371 --> 01:23:37,431
[SPEAKER_28]: Councilor Caviello.

1043
01:23:38,312 --> 01:23:45,295
[SPEAKER_28]: In light of everyone and to make everyone happy, I will resume my vote here so we can table for next week.

1044
01:23:45,874 --> 01:23:48,436
[SPEAKER_28]: And I hate to agree with Mr. Starello, but Mr. Starello is right.

1045
01:23:48,456 --> 01:23:56,443
[SPEAKER_28]: We're going to come back next week and we're going to vote on the same thing.

1046
01:23:57,424 --> 01:23:58,525
[SPEAKER_28]: There was nothing to clap about.

1047
01:23:58,745 --> 01:24:00,267
[SPEAKER_28]: Mr. Starello was right with his statement.

1048
01:24:00,287 --> 01:24:01,228
[SPEAKER_28]: Point of clarification.

1049
01:24:01,268 --> 01:24:01,788
[SPEAKER_29]: Wait a minute.

1050
01:24:02,008 --> 01:24:02,429
[SPEAKER_29]: Wait a minute.

1051
01:24:02,469 --> 01:24:03,870
[SPEAKER_29]: Point of Mr. Starello is wrong.

1052
01:24:04,411 --> 01:24:10,356
[SPEAKER_29]: Cause the, if you look at the department of local services rules that just were re promulgated in May of 2015,

1053
01:24:12,233 --> 01:24:17,076
[SPEAKER_29]: a local city council or a town council has to vote approval on a budget.

1054
01:24:17,297 --> 01:24:25,943
[SPEAKER_29]: And as a matter of fact, the new rulings, if the city council wants to add to a budget that has not been included in the budget, this time you can add to the budget.

1055
01:24:26,943 --> 01:24:29,025
[SPEAKER_29]: So I think, I think everybody started.

1056
01:24:29,045 --> 01:24:31,407
[SPEAKER_28]: There was a motion on the floor for approval.

1057
01:24:43,114 --> 01:24:57,823
[SPEAKER_21]: Section 22 was invoked incorrectly because the paper was brought before us, was tabled previously, and the paper before us was one that was brought off the floor and out of the Committee of the Whole.

1058
01:24:59,563 --> 01:25:03,466
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Camuso has a paper before us for approval.

1059
01:25:04,246 --> 01:25:06,467
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor, do you wish to move this paper?

1060
01:25:06,787 --> 01:25:06,948
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1061
01:25:08,238 --> 01:25:10,079
[SPEAKER_18]: No, he can't do that until after this paper is ruled upon.

1062
01:25:10,099 --> 01:25:11,500
[SPEAKER_18]: This paper has to be acted upon.

1063
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:12,641
[SPEAKER_18]: That's at a different time of the meeting.

1064
01:25:13,041 --> 01:25:17,483
[SPEAKER_18]: So on the motion of Councilor Camuso for approval, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1065
01:25:17,744 --> 01:25:24,648
[SPEAKER_30]: Mr. President, it seems to me members of this council are talking like they're legal experts.

1066
01:25:24,948 --> 01:25:30,111
[SPEAKER_30]: I mean, since when is Councilor Camuso the city solicitant?

1067
01:25:30,931 --> 01:25:31,912
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I know the rules, Councilor.

1068
01:25:31,932 --> 01:25:32,973
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why I was voted president.

1069
01:25:33,493 --> 01:25:34,894
[SPEAKER_11]: You haven't been the president since you've been here.

1070
01:25:34,914 --> 01:25:37,075
[SPEAKER_31]: Since when is he the city solicitant, Mr. President?

1071
01:25:37,881 --> 01:25:39,721
[SPEAKER_21]: We have a motion for approval before us.

1072
01:25:39,801 --> 01:25:40,621
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll act on it.

1073
01:25:42,402 --> 01:25:45,182
[SPEAKER_30]: The Council of Cabrillo will call for reconsideration.

1074
01:25:45,382 --> 01:25:46,663
[SPEAKER_30]: But that's not the vote we're on right now.

1075
01:25:46,983 --> 01:25:49,043
[SPEAKER_21]: We're on a motion right now.

1076
01:25:49,143 --> 01:25:52,163
[SPEAKER_21]: So we have an action before us that needs to be acted upon.

1077
01:25:52,544 --> 01:25:53,924
[SPEAKER_21]: And what action is that, Mr. President?

1078
01:25:54,184 --> 01:25:58,645
[SPEAKER_21]: For approval of the budget 15-460 before us.

1079
01:25:58,865 --> 01:26:02,945
[SPEAKER_29]: It can't be because you have a revised document that she just talked about.

1080
01:26:03,305 --> 01:26:06,386
[SPEAKER_29]: Why would you vote on an old one when you have a revised one?

1081
01:26:07,334 --> 01:26:07,854
[SPEAKER_18]: rule the meeting.

1082
01:26:09,435 --> 01:26:14,816
[SPEAKER_21]: We have a motion for approval on paper 15 for 60 as amended.

1083
01:26:14,956 --> 01:26:15,796
[SPEAKER_21]: Move section 22.

1084
01:26:17,076 --> 01:26:23,738
[SPEAKER_21]: You cannot, that the paper was tabled and already and taken off the table and sent into committee.

1085
01:26:23,878 --> 01:26:30,019
[SPEAKER_29]: Mrs. Milner-Lewis just indicated that she presented a revised document here this evening.

1086
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:34,620
[SPEAKER_29]: How can you vote on something that's been revised?

1087
01:26:38,370 --> 01:26:39,851
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1088
01:26:40,491 --> 01:26:46,333
[SPEAKER_26]: Parliamentary procedure aside, I think that the budget before us is a good budget.

1089
01:26:46,413 --> 01:26:52,035
[SPEAKER_26]: The budget before us provides with a number of technology changes at Medford High School and at Medford Public Schools.

1090
01:26:52,896 --> 01:26:57,778
[SPEAKER_26]: It moves away from standardized test teaching and towards whole person teaching, as Superintendent Belson said.

1091
01:26:59,078 --> 01:27:03,500
[SPEAKER_26]: It establishes a new full-time code enforcement officer that this council fought for for a year and a half, two years.

1092
01:27:04,402 --> 01:27:09,123
[SPEAKER_26]: It establishes a substance abuse coordinator's position that this council's been looking for for a year and a half, Mr. President.

1093
01:27:09,604 --> 01:27:17,146
[SPEAKER_26]: It also funds the facilities manager at our school buildings, a facilities manager who's actually put in a preventative maintenance plan at our schools.

1094
01:27:19,926 --> 01:27:24,588
[SPEAKER_07]: I just have to say that none of that is going to change in one week.

1095
01:27:30,589 --> 01:27:33,430
[SPEAKER_26]: And, Mr. President, I don't think some of the questions that we asked about capital projects

1096
01:27:33,863 --> 01:27:36,965
[SPEAKER_26]: that aren't related to the budget are going to change the actual bottom line of the budget either.

1097
01:27:37,666 --> 01:27:42,009
[SPEAKER_26]: I think that what's important for us to do is to take a look at this budget and to determine whether or not it's a good budget or not.

1098
01:27:42,510 --> 01:27:43,430
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think it is a good budget.

1099
01:27:43,450 --> 01:27:47,113
[SPEAKER_26]: And looking at it, I think one of the biggest things is that it saves the library.

1100
01:27:47,954 --> 01:27:48,675
[SPEAKER_26]: It saves the library.

1101
01:27:48,775 --> 01:27:54,859
[SPEAKER_26]: It gives a quarter of a million dollars increase in funding to the library to keep the library certified, meets state certification standards.

1102
01:27:56,661 --> 01:27:57,842
[SPEAKER_26]: The council has asked for several things.

1103
01:27:57,862 --> 01:27:59,683
[SPEAKER_26]: We've gotten several things that are put into this budget.

1104
01:28:00,023 --> 01:28:02,025
[SPEAKER_26]: I think it's a good budget, Mr. President, and I move approval.

1105
01:28:16,597 --> 01:28:17,317
[SPEAKER_29]: That's the case.

1106
01:28:17,337 --> 01:28:19,719
[SPEAKER_29]: I am not going to put myself in this type of a position.

1107
01:28:19,739 --> 01:28:20,920
[SPEAKER_29]: It's absolutely ridiculous.

1108
01:28:21,660 --> 01:28:24,642
When you have a revised budget, it's going to be the main budget of the vote.

1109
01:28:25,162 --> 01:28:25,803
That's the case.

1110
01:28:25,823 --> 01:28:37,450
I'm going to have you guys look away for a while, because you're not going to necessarily agree with me.

1111
01:28:52,413 --> 01:29:02,736
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, you know, week after week, it's the same people that get up here on every single issue, and they should be able to.

1112
01:29:02,776 --> 01:29:13,479
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the People's Forum, and they bring their... There has been not one person, other than the library group, that came up here on this budget.

1113
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:15,780
[SPEAKER_11]: On this budget.

1114
01:29:16,340 --> 01:29:22,142
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a budget that's adding several key components that this city council's pushed for over the years.

1115
01:29:22,957 --> 01:29:24,419
[SPEAKER_11]: They're working on a dog park right now.

1116
01:29:25,259 --> 01:29:27,982
[SPEAKER_11]: They're working on the substance abuse.

1117
01:29:28,823 --> 01:29:30,205
[SPEAKER_11]: Coordinator is in this budget.

1118
01:29:30,485 --> 01:29:32,327
[SPEAKER_11]: Code enforcement officer is in this budget.

1119
01:29:33,128 --> 01:29:36,411
[SPEAKER_11]: The superintendent of schools is adding adjustment counselors.

1120
01:29:36,772 --> 01:29:41,316
[SPEAKER_11]: We haven't seen adjustment counselors in how long, Mr. Superintendent?

1121
01:29:41,477 --> 01:29:42,558
[SPEAKER_11]: Quite a long period of time.

1122
01:29:46,186 --> 01:29:50,094
[SPEAKER_31]: Not one person behind this reel did I hear tonight say this was not a good budget.

1123
01:29:50,875 --> 01:29:53,721
[SPEAKER_31]: All we asked for merely was to get our questions answered.

1124
01:29:55,144 --> 01:29:55,625
[SPEAKER_31]: So that's...

1125
01:29:57,803 --> 01:29:58,723
[SPEAKER_31]: Can I finish?

1126
01:29:58,783 --> 01:30:01,084
[SPEAKER_31]: That's a red herring talking about the library.

1127
01:30:01,504 --> 01:30:03,345
[SPEAKER_31]: That money is going to be in the budget for next week.

1128
01:30:03,685 --> 01:30:06,346
[SPEAKER_31]: All these positions, that money is going to be in the budget.

1129
01:30:06,766 --> 01:30:08,967
[SPEAKER_31]: All we want is our questions answered.

1130
01:30:09,267 --> 01:30:14,769
[SPEAKER_31]: And to stifle those questions, or to say because no one — well, Mr. President — It's a point of information.

1131
01:30:14,989 --> 01:30:17,770
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, and other colleagues have had a long point of information, too.

1132
01:30:18,190 --> 01:30:19,830
[SPEAKER_31]: If I could finish my point, Mr. President.

1133
01:30:19,850 --> 01:30:20,291
[SPEAKER_31]: Please do.

1134
01:30:20,751 --> 01:30:21,631
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1135
01:30:22,011 --> 01:30:27,293
[SPEAKER_31]: And to say because no one came up to the real, or no one came to the Committee of the Whole meeting that we had,

1136
01:30:27,715 --> 01:30:33,297
[SPEAKER_31]: that everyone's content with this, and we should move approval, is a ridiculous argument, Mr. President.

1137
01:30:33,817 --> 01:30:35,337
[SPEAKER_31]: And that's all I need to say on that.

1138
01:30:36,638 --> 01:30:37,238
[SPEAKER_31]: Mr. President.

1139
01:30:41,659 --> 01:30:43,040
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, if I can just finish.

1140
01:30:43,060 --> 01:30:47,461
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, I move the reconsideration of the vote to table.

1141
01:30:48,041 --> 01:30:52,903
[SPEAKER_21]: On the motion of Counselor Caviello to move reconsideration on the motion to table.

1142
01:30:53,443 --> 01:30:55,444
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. Clerk, all those in favor?

1143
01:30:56,164 --> 01:30:56,244
[SPEAKER_21]: No.

1144
01:30:57,974 --> 01:30:59,175
[SPEAKER_21]: The chair is in doubt.

1145
01:30:59,215 --> 01:31:03,196
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. Clerk, call the roll for the motion to move reconsideration.

1146
01:31:03,216 --> 01:31:11,499
[SPEAKER_16]: For the motion to move reconsideration.

1147
01:31:11,519 --> 01:31:11,599
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

1148
01:31:11,799 --> 01:31:11,920
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

1149
01:31:25,635 --> 01:31:30,379
[SPEAKER_21]: No, on the vote of four in the affirmative, three in the negative, the motion carries.

1150
01:31:30,980 --> 01:31:34,042
[SPEAKER_21]: So on the motion to table, which was originally by.

1151
01:31:36,944 --> 01:31:43,409
[SPEAKER_21]: Motion to table was by Vice President Longo Kern.

1152
01:31:45,371 --> 01:31:46,832
[SPEAKER_21]: Roll call vote has been requested.

1153
01:31:55,771 --> 01:31:59,692
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1154
01:32:01,352 --> 01:32:01,672
[SPEAKER_31]: Yes.

1155
01:32:03,933 --> 01:32:04,193
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1156
01:32:06,833 --> 01:32:07,033
[SPEAKER_21]: No.

1157
01:32:07,673 --> 01:32:13,495
[SPEAKER_21]: And the vote of four in the affirmative, three in the negative, paper 15-460 is tabled.

1158
01:32:18,856 --> 01:32:22,937
[SPEAKER_21]: On the motion of Councilor Caviello to revert back to the regular order of business, all those in favor?

1159
01:32:24,079 --> 01:32:28,240
[SPEAKER_21]: It was opposed 15-542 under hearings.

1160
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:33,202
[SPEAKER_21]: Location of poles, attachment of fixtures, and underground conduits.

1161
01:32:33,982 --> 01:32:36,242
[SPEAKER_21]: Medford, Massachusetts, City Clerk's Office.

1162
01:32:36,842 --> 01:32:49,886
[SPEAKER_21]: You are hereby notified that by order of the Medford City Council, a public hearing will be given at the Howard F. Alden Memorial Auditorium, 85 George P. Hassett Drive, City Hall, Medford, Massachusetts, at 7 p.m.

1163
01:32:49,926 --> 01:32:50,746
[SPEAKER_21]: on Tuesday, June 23, 2015,

1164
01:32:53,713 --> 01:33:08,302
[SPEAKER_21]: on a petition by National Grid of North Andover in Verizon in New England for permission to locate poles, wires, and fixtures, including the necessary sustaining and protecting fixtures along and across the public way.

1165
01:33:08,863 --> 01:33:14,667
[SPEAKER_21]: Boston Avenue, National Grid to install one SO pole and relocate one JO pole.

1166
01:33:15,127 --> 01:33:18,029
[SPEAKER_21]: National Grid to install 325 feet plus or minus of 6 to 5 inch primary duct.

1167
01:33:24,684 --> 01:33:28,089
[SPEAKER_31]: Motion to waive the remainder of the reading and just give a brief synopsis, Mr. President.

1168
01:33:28,709 --> 01:33:42,026
[SPEAKER_21]: On the motion of Councillor Marks to read the tedious reading, the approval by the engineer to put this, fix these fixtures across the public way located at

1169
01:33:57,718 --> 01:34:00,600
[SPEAKER_21]: Boston Avenue.

1170
01:34:00,620 --> 01:34:02,141
[SPEAKER_21]: 451 Boston Avenue.

1171
01:34:02,761 --> 01:34:04,162
[SPEAKER_21]: And you are who, sir?

1172
01:34:05,083 --> 01:34:07,425
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is John Gannon with O'Connor Constructors.

1173
01:34:07,505 --> 01:34:09,026
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm the construction manager.

1174
01:34:09,346 --> 01:34:11,288
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm here in place for National Grid.

1175
01:34:11,628 --> 01:34:12,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.

1176
01:34:12,348 --> 01:34:15,050
[SPEAKER_21]: They're on emergency duty tonight.

1177
01:34:15,290 --> 01:34:21,395
[SPEAKER_21]: So with the public hearing now open, we ask all those in favor of this to come forward.

1178
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:25,061
[SPEAKER_21]: A representative of National Grid?

1179
01:34:25,481 --> 01:34:30,623
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they're on emergency storm duty tonight, so I volunteered to stand in for them.

1180
01:34:31,003 --> 01:34:34,465
[SPEAKER_21]: Do we have another utility company present at this program too?

1181
01:34:35,105 --> 01:34:35,786
[SPEAKER_21]: Not for this subject.

1182
01:34:35,806 --> 01:34:35,966
[SPEAKER_21]: No.

1183
01:34:36,486 --> 01:34:36,906
[SPEAKER_21]: Very good.

1184
01:34:36,986 --> 01:34:38,367
[SPEAKER_21]: So you're in favor?

1185
01:34:38,807 --> 01:34:39,047
[SPEAKER_33]: Yes.

1186
01:34:39,327 --> 01:34:39,727
[SPEAKER_21]: Very good.

1187
01:34:40,127 --> 01:34:41,288
[SPEAKER_21]: Anybody in opposition?

1188
01:34:42,188 --> 01:34:43,989
[SPEAKER_21]: Anybody in opposition to this matter?

1189
01:34:44,569 --> 01:34:52,813
[SPEAKER_21]: Hearing and seeing none, I declare that portion of the meeting closed and open up the paper to Councilor Penta.

1190
01:34:53,449 --> 01:34:55,010
[SPEAKER_29]: Sir, could you identify yourself again?

1191
01:34:55,470 --> 01:34:55,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1192
01:34:55,831 --> 01:34:57,251
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is John Gannon.

1193
01:34:57,432 --> 01:34:59,173
[SPEAKER_05]: I work for O'Connor Constructors.

1194
01:34:59,733 --> 01:35:03,976
[SPEAKER_05]: We're a construction manager building a project for Tufts University on Boston Avenue.

1195
01:35:05,056 --> 01:35:13,362
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's three changes that need to be done in the city sidewalk by National Grid in order for us to build our project.

1196
01:35:13,722 --> 01:35:15,763
[SPEAKER_29]: So you're here on behalf of Tufts University.

1197
01:35:15,783 --> 01:35:17,184
[SPEAKER_29]: You're not here on behalf of the project.

1198
01:35:18,002 --> 01:35:21,583
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm here on behalf of Tufts University, that's correct.

1199
01:35:21,663 --> 01:35:26,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Normally National Grid would come to this meeting, but they're on emergency duty tonight.

1200
01:35:27,084 --> 01:35:34,085
[SPEAKER_05]: So instead of having nobody show, Tufts decided to send their construction manager instead of someone from National Grid.

1201
01:35:34,645 --> 01:35:41,707
[SPEAKER_29]: I think in all fairness to the project, and I can appreciate you being here, but you're not the applicant.

1202
01:35:41,867 --> 01:35:43,167
[SPEAKER_05]: National Grid is the applicant.

1203
01:35:43,487 --> 01:35:46,428
[SPEAKER_05]: I do have the ability to answer questions about the proposal, though.

1204
01:35:48,486 --> 01:35:49,126
[SPEAKER_29]: Go ahead.

1205
01:35:49,166 --> 01:35:56,791
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, I just don't know if you could even pass on this because he's not the legitimate applicant.

1206
01:35:57,331 --> 01:36:01,093
[SPEAKER_05]: I can explain what we're asking to do.

1207
01:36:01,113 --> 01:36:02,394
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, go ahead.

1208
01:36:02,434 --> 01:36:05,796
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to build a new construction project on Boston Avenue.

1209
01:36:06,516 --> 01:36:10,498
[SPEAKER_05]: And that requires, typically any construction project requires temporary power.

1210
01:36:11,599 --> 01:36:17,182
[SPEAKER_05]: And in order to get enough temporary power, they have to add a temporary power pole in the sidewalk.

1211
01:36:18,074 --> 01:36:22,276
[SPEAKER_05]: That at the end of the project, approximately 16 months from now, will be removed.

1212
01:36:23,496 --> 01:36:26,958
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's all on Tufts property, so we're not affecting any neighbors.

1213
01:36:28,378 --> 01:36:35,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Another element is there's an existing utility pole that's in the way of the new service drive to the new building that we're building.

1214
01:36:36,161 --> 01:36:38,162
[SPEAKER_05]: That needs to be moved over 35 feet.

1215
01:36:38,182 --> 01:36:41,944
[SPEAKER_05]: And once again, that's not affecting any of Tufts neighbors.

1216
01:36:42,024 --> 01:36:43,104
[SPEAKER_05]: It's on their own sidewalk.

1217
01:36:43,124 --> 01:36:45,425
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's on your sidewalk in front of their property.

1218
01:36:46,632 --> 01:36:54,559
[SPEAKER_05]: And in order to power the new facility, we have to put in several hundred feet of duct bank underneath the city's sidewalk.

1219
01:36:54,619 --> 01:37:02,045
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's in our contract, the construction manager's contract, to completely replace that sidewalk once that duct bank is installed.

1220
01:37:03,226 --> 01:37:11,914
[SPEAKER_29]: There's a line in here that says National Grid will inform the city of any newly installed duct bank that it determines in the future will not be used.

1221
01:37:12,570 --> 01:37:17,955
[SPEAKER_29]: as the 105-foot length of duct bank that extends from the building service to the pole.

1222
01:37:18,575 --> 01:37:21,718
[SPEAKER_29]: So the building service to the pole, you're going to have to go over a public sidewalk.

1223
01:37:23,079 --> 01:37:25,061
[SPEAKER_05]: All the work is under a public sidewalk.

1224
01:37:25,101 --> 01:37:27,923
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why it's in the petition, excuse me.

1225
01:37:28,123 --> 01:37:35,089
[SPEAKER_29]: Usually when we get something like this, Madam Chairperson, we get some kind of response back from our city engineer.

1226
01:37:35,109 --> 01:37:37,151
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe that's been approved by the city engineer.

1227
01:37:37,191 --> 01:37:37,451
[SPEAKER_05]: Pardon me?

1228
01:37:37,931 --> 01:37:41,134
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe it's been approved by the city engineer and the wiring inspector.

1229
01:37:41,968 --> 01:37:45,011
[SPEAKER_29]: It says approved superintendent-wise, but it doesn't say city engineer.

1230
01:37:45,911 --> 01:37:47,532
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking here on page two.

1231
01:37:47,552 --> 01:37:48,013
[SPEAKER_05]: Approved.

1232
01:37:48,033 --> 01:37:55,479
[SPEAKER_05]: City engineer, upon review of this petition in the engineering department, based on the engineer's review, the board can proceed forthwith.

1233
01:37:55,519 --> 01:37:56,099
[SPEAKER_30]: Chief engineer?

1234
01:37:56,119 --> 01:38:03,065
[SPEAKER_30]: One, two, three, four.

1235
01:38:06,607 --> 01:38:09,089
[SPEAKER_29]: So that's what you people call our city engineer chief engineer?

1236
01:38:09,890 --> 01:38:11,111
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe it's Cassandra.

1237
01:38:11,956 --> 01:38:13,357
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe is the primary.

1238
01:38:13,877 --> 01:38:14,578
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah.

1239
01:38:15,258 --> 01:38:15,658
[SPEAKER_29]: That's it is.

1240
01:38:15,999 --> 01:38:16,219
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay.

1241
01:38:17,319 --> 01:38:17,740
[SPEAKER_29]: All right.

1242
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:22,262
[SPEAKER_29]: I just want to make sure, like I said, you're not the applicant, so if you fill in it, I am.

1243
01:38:22,302 --> 01:38:22,983
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the best we can do.

1244
01:38:23,023 --> 01:38:23,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1245
01:38:23,303 --> 01:38:23,663
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1246
01:38:23,903 --> 01:38:26,565
[SPEAKER_05]: National grid on a night like this, nobody could show up.

1247
01:38:26,845 --> 01:38:27,205
[SPEAKER_05]: No problem.

1248
01:38:28,566 --> 01:38:29,106
[SPEAKER_07]: Councillor Knight.

1249
01:38:29,387 --> 01:38:34,930
[SPEAKER_24]: Does this project have any relation to the easement project that we granted for the construction of the new science labs?

1250
01:38:36,867 --> 01:38:41,169
[SPEAKER_24]: We granted a permanent underground easement recently for the construction of the new science labs.

1251
01:38:41,229 --> 01:38:42,389
[SPEAKER_24]: Is this project related to that?

1252
01:38:42,589 --> 01:38:43,230
[SPEAKER_05]: This is not.

1253
01:38:43,250 --> 01:38:45,931
[SPEAKER_05]: That is the Science and Engineering Center, which is down the street from us.

1254
01:38:46,011 --> 01:38:47,051
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, no relation whatsoever.

1255
01:38:47,131 --> 01:38:48,412
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's a different project completely.

1256
01:38:48,432 --> 01:38:48,752
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, thank you.

1257
01:38:50,993 --> 01:38:51,973
[SPEAKER_26]: Madam President, I move for approval.

1258
01:38:53,763 --> 01:38:54,684
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1259
01:38:54,824 --> 01:38:56,085
[SPEAKER_26]: I'll close the public hearing, I guess.

1260
01:38:56,105 --> 01:38:58,307
[SPEAKER_26]: We'd have to open it up to anybody in opposition.

1261
01:38:58,587 --> 01:39:00,388
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure if we closed the public hearing.

1262
01:39:00,468 --> 01:39:01,569
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm obviously in favor.

1263
01:39:01,990 --> 01:39:02,930
[SPEAKER_26]: Did we already close the public hearing?

1264
01:39:03,571 --> 01:39:04,091
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't think we did.

1265
01:39:04,111 --> 01:39:04,952
[SPEAKER_26]: No, I don't think we did either.

1266
01:39:04,972 --> 01:39:07,394
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't think we did either, but I started asking questions when the public hearing was open.

1267
01:39:07,414 --> 01:39:08,215
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for speaking in favor.

1268
01:39:08,315 --> 01:39:10,096
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody else in favor of the project?

1269
01:39:11,357 --> 01:39:12,238
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody else in favor?

1270
01:39:12,258 --> 01:39:14,059
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll close that portion of the public hearing.

1271
01:39:14,119 --> 01:39:15,781
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody in opposition?

1272
01:39:17,262 --> 01:39:18,103
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody in opposition?

1273
01:39:20,402 --> 01:39:23,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Hearing and seeing none, close that portion of the public hearing.

1274
01:39:23,543 --> 01:39:24,663
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight, will you move for approval?

1275
01:39:24,683 --> 01:39:25,803
[SPEAKER_26]: Move for approval, Madam President.

1276
01:39:25,923 --> 01:39:26,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Paper 15542.

1277
01:39:26,323 --> 01:39:27,684
[SPEAKER_26]: Location of the poll attachment.

1278
01:39:28,304 --> 01:39:30,304
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion for approval by Councilor Knight.

1279
01:39:33,785 --> 01:39:34,525
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

1280
01:39:34,785 --> 01:39:35,405
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

1281
01:39:35,445 --> 01:39:36,125
[SPEAKER_07]: Paper passes.

1282
01:39:36,865 --> 01:39:39,746
[SPEAKER_07]: Paper 15-543, Grants of Location.

1283
01:39:40,446 --> 01:39:48,648
[SPEAKER_07]: Medford, Massachusetts City Clerk's Office, you are hereby notified that by order of the City Council, a public hearing will be given at the Howard F. Alden Memorial Auditorium

1284
01:39:52,926 --> 01:39:53,987
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to waive the reading.

1285
01:39:54,427 --> 01:39:55,047
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

1286
01:39:55,067 --> 01:39:55,827
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

1287
01:39:57,528 --> 01:40:12,634
[SPEAKER_07]: National grid needs permission to construct locations of mains for the transmission and distribution of gas on Sargent Street, and they want to extend the gas main 150 feet plastic in Sargent Street to serve number 73 Sargent Street.

1288
01:40:12,734 --> 01:40:15,715
[SPEAKER_07]: This was approved by the city engineer based on her review.

1289
01:40:21,502 --> 01:40:22,362
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

1290
01:40:22,382 --> 01:40:24,684
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

1291
01:40:25,884 --> 01:40:26,625
[SPEAKER_07]: Please come forward.

1292
01:40:34,450 --> 01:40:35,790
[SPEAKER_07]: Just name and address for the record.

1293
01:40:35,810 --> 01:40:39,913
[SPEAKER_27]: Robert Gould, 7 Fall Street, Malden.

1294
01:40:41,434 --> 01:40:42,434
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody else in favor?

1295
01:40:43,935 --> 01:40:46,497
[SPEAKER_07]: Hearing and seeing none, I close that portion of the hearing.

1296
01:40:47,261 --> 01:40:50,763
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody in opposition to paper 15-543?

1297
01:40:51,984 --> 01:40:52,944
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody in opposition?

1298
01:40:53,905 --> 01:40:56,306
[SPEAKER_07]: Hearing and seeing none, close that portion of the public hearing.

1299
01:40:57,267 --> 01:40:58,007
[SPEAKER_07]: Open it up to the chair.

1300
01:40:58,067 --> 01:40:58,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

1301
01:40:59,208 --> 01:41:00,348
[SPEAKER_26]: Madam President, thank you very much.

1302
01:41:01,029 --> 01:41:01,509
[SPEAKER_26]: Can you tell me...

1303
01:41:02,158 --> 01:41:06,540
[SPEAKER_26]: When the project is going to start, once this matter is approved, how long after the approval?

1304
01:41:07,441 --> 01:41:08,681
[SPEAKER_27]: We're just waiting to get approval.

1305
01:41:08,962 --> 01:41:11,623
[SPEAKER_27]: And paperwork's been all approved by the company.

1306
01:41:12,343 --> 01:41:18,487
[SPEAKER_27]: And this customer has been waiting for over a year to have this gas main extended to provide service to his house.

1307
01:41:18,827 --> 01:41:21,048
[SPEAKER_24]: This is a residential fixture that you're going to be switching out?

1308
01:41:21,288 --> 01:41:29,953
[SPEAKER_27]: We're going to extend the gas main in the street 147 feet in order to reach the resident and provide service to the house.

1309
01:41:33,396 --> 01:41:35,858
[SPEAKER_24]: And your hours of construction work are going to be performed?

1310
01:41:35,878 --> 01:41:36,799
[SPEAKER_24]: 7 to 3.30.

1311
01:41:37,439 --> 01:41:38,620
[SPEAKER_27]: 7 to 3.30 normal hours.

1312
01:41:38,640 --> 01:41:42,764
[SPEAKER_26]: Normal working hours, yes.

1313
01:41:43,645 --> 01:41:48,248
[SPEAKER_26]: Madam President, it's delivering gas to a residential home.

1314
01:41:48,268 --> 01:41:52,852
[SPEAKER_26]: They've been waiting over a year for the project to make its way through approval design construction phases.

1315
01:41:52,892 --> 01:41:54,574
[SPEAKER_26]: So I think they've waited long enough.

1316
01:41:54,594 --> 01:41:55,294
[SPEAKER_26]: Let's eat their house.

1317
01:41:55,474 --> 01:41:56,155
[SPEAKER_26]: I move for approval.

1318
01:41:56,816 --> 01:41:58,217
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion for approval by Councilor Knight.

1319
01:41:58,257 --> 01:41:58,877
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Penta?

1320
01:41:59,278 --> 01:41:59,838
[SPEAKER_29]: Quick question.

1321
01:42:00,178 --> 01:42:00,959
[SPEAKER_29]: What did you say?

1322
01:42:00,979 --> 01:42:01,219
[SPEAKER_29]: Is it 121 feet?

1323
01:42:02,951 --> 01:42:09,096
[SPEAKER_27]: 147 feet from the end of the existing main to reach the house that's looking for the gas service.

1324
01:42:09,176 --> 01:42:10,017
[SPEAKER_29]: And that's on the street.

1325
01:42:10,397 --> 01:42:10,657
[SPEAKER_27]: Correct.

1326
01:42:11,177 --> 01:42:14,240
[SPEAKER_29]: And how do you intend to repair the street once you dig it up?

1327
01:42:14,260 --> 01:42:19,784
[SPEAKER_27]: Uh, put back asphalt, um, in the, the trench that we dig.

1328
01:42:20,084 --> 01:42:22,586
[SPEAKER_29]: Is this in the middle of the street to the left?

1329
01:42:22,606 --> 01:42:24,667
[SPEAKER_27]: 14 feet off the backside of sidewalk to this.

1330
01:42:25,028 --> 01:42:26,128
[SPEAKER_27]: So it's pretty much in the gutter.

1331
01:42:26,409 --> 01:42:26,689
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay.

1332
01:42:26,949 --> 01:42:28,090
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, if that's the case, um,

1333
01:42:29,461 --> 01:42:37,927
[SPEAKER_29]: You realize that the city is implementing — going to be implementing a new policy that, six months after that trench, that — you know, the street better be the way it's supposed to be.

1334
01:42:38,427 --> 01:42:43,610
[SPEAKER_29]: Because many times, when you folks go out there, whoever your contractors are, you know, it sinks.

1335
01:42:43,630 --> 01:42:45,632
[SPEAKER_27]: The trench — The President.

1336
01:42:45,652 --> 01:42:46,272
[SPEAKER_27]: We try not to.

1337
01:42:46,292 --> 01:42:46,392
[SPEAKER_29]: Huh?

1338
01:42:46,852 --> 01:42:47,513
[SPEAKER_27]: We try not to.

1339
01:42:47,933 --> 01:42:52,776
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, you try not to, but drive around the city right now and go look at all the trenches you've dug up.

1340
01:42:55,378 --> 01:42:58,600
[SPEAKER_29]: Move approval with that — with that condition now, Madam President, that the city —

1341
01:42:59,218 --> 01:43:02,901
[SPEAKER_29]: review this subject matter upon completion, six months upon completion.

1342
01:43:03,361 --> 01:43:07,203
[SPEAKER_07]: City reviews subject matter upon six months completion.

1343
01:43:07,223 --> 01:43:08,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion for approval.

1344
01:43:08,844 --> 01:43:09,405
[SPEAKER_07]: Council Marks.

1345
01:43:10,486 --> 01:43:12,127
[SPEAKER_31]: Roughly how long do you anticipate the work?

1346
01:43:15,029 --> 01:43:19,772
[SPEAKER_27]: With no weather delays or anything, it should probably be maybe a week to two weeks.

1347
01:43:19,792 --> 01:43:20,992
[SPEAKER_27]: It shouldn't be a big job.

1348
01:43:21,413 --> 01:43:23,434
[SPEAKER_31]: And when will it primarily be done?

1349
01:43:23,514 --> 01:43:24,435
[SPEAKER_31]: Is it during the day or night?

1350
01:43:24,455 --> 01:43:24,975
[SPEAKER_31]: During the day, yes.

1351
01:43:24,995 --> 01:43:25,475
[SPEAKER_31]: During the day?

1352
01:43:25,676 --> 01:43:26,096
[SPEAKER_27]: During the day.

1353
01:43:28,456 --> 01:43:28,516
[SPEAKER_27]: 7-3-30.

1354
01:43:28,536 --> 01:43:28,656
[SPEAKER_27]: 7-3-30?

1355
01:43:28,856 --> 01:43:29,877
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes.

1356
01:43:29,897 --> 01:43:31,557
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

1357
01:43:32,998 --> 01:43:36,719
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion for approval by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Camuso.

1358
01:43:36,739 --> 01:43:37,319
[SPEAKER_07]: Did I hear that?

1359
01:43:37,779 --> 01:43:38,919
[SPEAKER_07]: Seconded by Councilor Camuso.

1360
01:43:38,939 --> 01:43:39,700
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

1361
01:43:40,080 --> 01:43:40,980
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

1362
01:43:41,020 --> 01:43:41,340
[SPEAKER_07]: Paper.

1363
01:43:41,660 --> 01:43:43,201
[SPEAKER_07]: As amended, paper passes.

1364
01:43:44,041 --> 01:43:44,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1365
01:43:44,601 --> 01:43:45,922
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you very much.

1366
01:43:46,782 --> 01:43:46,982
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1367
01:43:47,002 --> 01:43:52,684
[SPEAKER_19]: What do you want to do next?

1368
01:43:52,704 --> 01:43:53,464
[SPEAKER_17]: What's this one?

1369
01:43:54,625 --> 01:43:55,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want to come speak on that?

1370
01:44:01,357 --> 01:44:06,260
[SPEAKER_07]: move for suspension of the rules by Councillor Penter to allow residents to speak.

1371
01:44:08,382 --> 01:44:09,582
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Sharon Diesso.

1372
01:44:09,602 --> 01:44:11,484
[SPEAKER_06]: I live at 130 Circuit Road in Medford.

1373
01:44:12,824 --> 01:44:19,989
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm here on a brief topic that is actually related in one way to the last time I was here a few weeks ago.

1374
01:44:20,770 --> 01:44:23,011
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a sidewalk this time, it's a street.

1375
01:44:23,451 --> 01:44:28,154
[SPEAKER_06]: And the same day I was looking into this, I happened to bump into

1376
01:44:30,123 --> 01:44:32,885
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilman Carviello, excuse me, I have a very bad cold.

1377
01:44:33,826 --> 01:44:41,371
[SPEAKER_06]: And he, I was going to look into something, I don't know if it came to fruition because he had to leave the meeting.

1378
01:44:42,291 --> 01:44:55,380
[SPEAKER_06]: About a year ago, while walking through Meffitt Square, an older woman alighted from the sidewalk after getting on a bus, off a bus, and nearly tumbled forward.

1379
01:44:56,121 --> 01:44:59,743
[SPEAKER_06]: And I thought maybe it was my eyesight the second time,

1380
01:45:00,440 --> 01:45:07,586
[SPEAKER_06]: I was walking through the square and noticed, you know, because I had had retina surgery a while ago, and I said, maybe it's my eyes.

1381
01:45:07,646 --> 01:45:09,488
[SPEAKER_06]: And I said, what's going on?

1382
01:45:10,189 --> 01:45:12,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's hard to see the black hardtop.

1383
01:45:12,671 --> 01:45:20,958
[SPEAKER_06]: There were rivets from Papageno's all the way down to the CVS, past the donut shop, and on the opposite side of the street.

1384
01:45:22,259 --> 01:45:30,686
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not an engineer, but I would assume this would be caused from the buses, the heat of the buses and the constant weight of the buses moving through the square.

1385
01:45:31,687 --> 01:45:42,736
[SPEAKER_06]: So during the year, another woman I also saw almost took a tumble because you were light from the sidewalk thinking that you're going to go this far, but take a walk one day.

1386
01:45:42,756 --> 01:45:49,642
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know, I don't walk that often myself in that area, but I've gone a few times now and happened to mention it to

1387
01:45:50,272 --> 01:45:53,133
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilman Caraviello, and he said, you know, I thought I noticed that, too.

1388
01:45:53,193 --> 01:45:54,133
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a real concern.

1389
01:45:55,513 --> 01:45:56,493
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like an ocean.

1390
01:45:57,233 --> 01:45:59,494
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like this, almost to the middle of the street.

1391
01:46:00,334 --> 01:46:16,897
[SPEAKER_06]: So on an appointment near one of the shops on Salem Street one day, I happened to notice the same thing getting out of my car to go over to the hardware store, Dunkin' Donuts, hardware store being one of my

1392
01:46:18,016 --> 01:46:20,019
[SPEAKER_06]: seems to be a good errand every single week.

1393
01:46:20,039 --> 01:46:21,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Something's always going wrong in the house.

1394
01:46:21,662 --> 01:46:25,347
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm saying this can't be happening again.

1395
01:46:26,189 --> 01:46:27,511
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't say anything to the council people.

1396
01:46:27,531 --> 01:46:28,893
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to think you're out of your mind.

1397
01:46:29,394 --> 01:46:35,598
[SPEAKER_06]: So I asked a couple of shop owners if this had been an apparent problem, and they said, you have no idea.

1398
01:46:35,638 --> 01:46:37,839
[SPEAKER_06]: People have almost fallen coming out of our stores.

1399
01:46:38,359 --> 01:46:38,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at it.

1400
01:46:38,819 --> 01:46:40,681
[SPEAKER_06]: It goes all the way down to the car yards.

1401
01:46:41,461 --> 01:46:47,885
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's from that Hubcap shop all the way down past Tony Giglio's shop, almost to the car bounds.

1402
01:46:48,305 --> 01:46:49,606
[SPEAKER_06]: Take a walk, go look at them.

1403
01:46:50,046 --> 01:46:51,987
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's a real point for public safety.

1404
01:46:52,367 --> 01:46:53,328
[SPEAKER_06]: But the good point is,

1405
01:46:53,828 --> 01:46:55,949
[SPEAKER_06]: I really think that the T is responsible for this.

1406
01:46:56,469 --> 01:47:05,212
[SPEAKER_06]: So it may not have to cost, you know, a big review of including something in the public works or the highway department budget.

1407
01:47:05,632 --> 01:47:13,595
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm just asking as a favor, if some people could really give us some serious pictures, go investigate it, and find out what's going on.

1408
01:47:13,635 --> 01:47:20,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully the T, I think, is largely responsible for this, or trucks pulling up with heavy weight in front of stores.

1409
01:47:21,078 --> 01:47:22,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for your time.

1410
01:47:22,923 --> 01:47:24,824
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a safe 4th of July if I don't see you.

1411
01:47:25,405 --> 01:47:25,705
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

1412
01:47:26,085 --> 01:47:28,187
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you very much for coming up tonight, Sharon.

1413
01:47:28,227 --> 01:47:29,588
[SPEAKER_20]: It's always a pleasure to see you.

1414
01:47:29,668 --> 01:47:30,068
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1415
01:47:30,088 --> 01:47:30,509
[SPEAKER_06]: You too.

1416
01:47:30,749 --> 01:47:31,109
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1417
01:47:32,170 --> 01:47:41,156
[SPEAKER_21]: So on the motion of Vice President Lugo-Kern to follow through on the matter, to have

1418
01:47:50,630 --> 01:47:52,901
[SPEAKER_19]: City solicitor see if there's a liability issue.

1419
01:48:26,821 --> 01:48:49,833
[SPEAKER_21]: On the motion to take papers 1 5 5 5 3 and 1 5 5 5 4 out of order so on the motion of councillor night all those in favor all those opposed 15 5 5 3 petition for reversal of sign denial by Jeffrey Sarah of Batten brothers for Panera Bread

1420
01:48:51,153 --> 01:49:03,482
[SPEAKER_21]: 499 Riverside Avenue, Medford Mass, OCD, application 2015-12, sign number 1, sign number 2, sign number 3, application 2015-11C, application 2015-18, excessive number of signs, application 2015-11F, excessive number of signs, application 2015 signs 4, 5, 6, 7, and 10, excessive number of signs.

1421
01:49:03,502 --> 01:49:04,103
[SPEAKER_21]: Can you say that again?

1422
01:49:04,663 --> 01:49:04,723
[SPEAKER_21]: Sir.

1423
01:49:20,634 --> 01:49:22,615
[SPEAKER_21]: Tell us about your excessive signs.

1424
01:49:24,655 --> 01:49:26,216
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Jason Berg.

1425
01:49:27,476 --> 01:49:32,058
[SPEAKER_04]: I am with the owner of the noodles and company and the Panera Bread.

1426
01:49:33,599 --> 01:49:35,599
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll be part of all three of these.

1427
01:49:36,040 --> 01:49:39,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeff Sarah is with the sign company who applied on my behalf.

1428
01:49:42,262 --> 01:49:45,463
[SPEAKER_04]: In front of you, you have, you should have,

1429
01:49:48,485 --> 01:49:50,106
[SPEAKER_04]: We're talking about Panera first, correct?

1430
01:49:50,506 --> 01:49:51,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, please.

1431
01:49:51,406 --> 01:49:53,948
[SPEAKER_04]: So how's this?

1432
01:49:54,788 --> 01:49:56,869
[SPEAKER_04]: See how good I am.

1433
01:50:01,111 --> 01:50:01,331
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

1434
01:50:04,433 --> 01:50:06,534
[SPEAKER_04]: By right, we are allowed two building signs.

1435
01:50:07,494 --> 01:50:13,937
[SPEAKER_04]: And with the way the building, I think you're aware of the building that's going on Riverside Avenue in front of the stop and chop.

1436
01:50:15,898 --> 01:50:19,120
[SPEAKER_04]: the same conversation for the Panera and for the noodles.

1437
01:50:19,220 --> 01:50:24,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously we're on both of the end caps and we would clearly have a sign on the front of the building.

1438
01:50:25,885 --> 01:50:29,027
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the question is, is where would the second or third sign go?

1439
01:50:29,107 --> 01:50:35,711
[SPEAKER_04]: And with the large development behind us, we wanted to have signage back there and as well as on the side.

1440
01:50:35,731 --> 01:50:38,013
[SPEAKER_04]: So people coming on Riverside Avenue either way.

1441
01:50:40,855 --> 01:50:42,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Below you'll see all the different signs that we have.

1442
01:50:44,214 --> 01:50:46,256
[SPEAKER_04]: With the drive-through signs, there's a menu panel.

1443
01:50:46,296 --> 01:50:55,486
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we're talking about excessive signs because there's a menu panel, there's a preview panel, there's directional signs to guide people through the parking lot so they go the correct way.

1444
01:50:58,589 --> 01:51:00,912
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why I'm here.

1445
01:51:08,072 --> 01:51:09,513
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Longo Kern.

1446
01:51:09,573 --> 01:51:10,814
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, President DelaRusso.

1447
01:51:11,674 --> 01:51:20,560
[SPEAKER_07]: On the second board, I'm sorry, and we have it in our packet that you had given us, is the three signs lined up.

1448
01:51:20,580 --> 01:51:25,924
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, obviously, the middle one is the side, because you have the little drive-through window.

1449
01:51:25,944 --> 01:51:26,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that's correct.

1450
01:51:27,205 --> 01:51:28,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Which one is the back?

1451
01:51:28,085 --> 01:51:30,607
[SPEAKER_07]: Which one is facing Riverside Ave, the top or the bottom?

1452
01:51:32,008 --> 01:51:33,829
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you just describe which location?

1453
01:51:33,869 --> 01:51:36,871
[SPEAKER_04]: I can tell you for on this one, the bottom is the front.

1454
01:51:37,051 --> 01:51:37,632
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, thank you.

1455
01:51:40,357 --> 01:51:41,918
[SPEAKER_04]: You could see with all the glass windows.

1456
01:51:42,638 --> 01:51:43,379
[SPEAKER_29]: Where does it face?

1457
01:51:43,439 --> 01:51:44,199
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm sorry?

1458
01:51:45,059 --> 01:51:46,280
[SPEAKER_29]: Where does it face?

1459
01:51:46,400 --> 01:51:47,561
[SPEAKER_04]: It faces Riverside Avenue.

1460
01:51:50,122 --> 01:51:50,402
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

1461
01:51:50,982 --> 01:51:51,162
[SPEAKER_29]: Sorry.

1462
01:51:52,143 --> 01:51:54,344
[SPEAKER_07]: Last question.

1463
01:51:54,524 --> 01:51:56,425
[SPEAKER_07]: I noticed you have the smaller signs.

1464
01:51:59,487 --> 01:52:00,107
[SPEAKER_07]: Do not enter.

1465
01:52:00,127 --> 01:52:00,747
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1466
01:52:00,767 --> 01:52:07,551
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe we put a requirement that there had to be a sign that says, do not queue beyond this point.

1467
01:52:08,011 --> 01:52:08,271
[SPEAKER_07]: Did we?

1468
01:52:10,738 --> 01:52:12,880
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sorry, could you repeat that, Madam Vice President?

1469
01:52:13,860 --> 01:52:14,661
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that was a Panera.

1470
01:52:15,782 --> 01:52:21,266
[SPEAKER_07]: Ed, maybe through the city clerk, I don't know if you have the paper of their common victuals license.

1471
01:52:21,306 --> 01:52:29,732
[SPEAKER_07]: We put a recommendation or a requirement that they had to put some sort of sign with regards to not queuing beyond a certain point to block the egress.

1472
01:52:32,293 --> 01:52:40,059
[SPEAKER_04]: For the common vituals hearing that I was here for with the Panera, the only conversation was around the exhaust, exactly.

1473
01:52:40,547 --> 01:52:47,311
[SPEAKER_07]: There was conversation around the exhaust, yes, but I believe we had a paper in there requiring do not queue beyond this point.

1474
01:52:48,272 --> 01:52:49,613
[SPEAKER_21]: Councillor Knight's good with the minutes.

1475
01:52:49,633 --> 01:52:50,754
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't believe that was it.

1476
01:52:50,794 --> 01:52:53,535
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it was drawn out in a way that it was impossible.

1477
01:52:53,936 --> 01:53:03,722
[SPEAKER_21]: The major issue we dealt with is the major issue that we dealt with on that was the issue of what was going on in Riverside Ave.

1478
01:53:04,182 --> 01:53:06,664
[SPEAKER_21]: And we had requested that the traffic commission put a

1479
01:53:07,549 --> 01:53:11,830
[SPEAKER_21]: blocks in that indicated one should not block the grid.

1480
01:53:12,990 --> 01:53:20,452
[SPEAKER_04]: I know when the landlord did come in front of you to have conversations, it has been redesigned since then to what it is currently.

1481
01:53:21,533 --> 01:53:24,913
[SPEAKER_07]: I would just add, if we, I'm going to have to go pull the minutes.

1482
01:53:25,754 --> 01:53:28,694
[SPEAKER_07]: Talk about for the drive-through, because there was only a certain amount of cue spots.

1483
01:53:29,135 --> 01:53:34,576
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember specifically, you know, having a problem with it, but wanting to allow the drive-through.

1484
01:53:34,949 --> 01:53:43,212
[SPEAKER_07]: I just have a problem with them blocking the, there's going to be an entrance at the end of the drive-thru, blocking parking, blocking the entrance and exit.

1485
01:53:43,492 --> 01:53:52,156
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're specifically at 90% call requiring a sign that says do not queue beyond this point.

1486
01:53:53,776 --> 01:54:03,440
[SPEAKER_15]: If it's on the drive-thru, which is a special permit, that condition will show up if it's already on there.

1487
01:54:04,031 --> 01:54:05,331
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, can we check that?

1488
01:54:06,132 --> 01:54:07,252
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have that here?

1489
01:54:08,092 --> 01:54:10,213
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I mean, you'd have to go back to maybe the records.

1490
01:54:10,313 --> 01:54:13,274
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like December 9, 2015 is the record we're looking for.

1491
01:54:13,334 --> 01:54:14,214
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't have it, yeah.

1492
01:54:14,234 --> 01:54:14,794
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1493
01:54:15,515 --> 01:54:17,575
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll try to look for it, and then if anybody else has a comment.

1494
01:54:17,595 --> 01:54:31,760
[SPEAKER_15]: But if it's a, you can make the condition on the zoning, so if it's part of, I mean, the drive-through is a special permit, so if it shows that we'll be on there, the condition on this application, I'm not sure you can do it.

1495
01:54:33,058 --> 01:54:38,062
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if anybody else has any questions.

1496
01:54:38,082 --> 01:54:39,002
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll yield for right now.

1497
01:54:41,444 --> 01:54:57,575
[SPEAKER_26]: I think I have the minutes, Mr. President.

1498
01:54:57,895 --> 01:54:59,316
[SPEAKER_04]: What freestanding center are you referring to?

1499
01:55:00,720 --> 01:55:04,364
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a freestanding sign that's there currently for the entire development.

1500
01:55:05,105 --> 01:55:06,426
[SPEAKER_04]: That's existing.

1501
01:55:06,766 --> 01:55:08,288
[SPEAKER_04]: There is not another one that's going in.

1502
01:55:08,308 --> 01:55:12,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless we're looking at something.

1503
01:55:12,773 --> 01:55:15,556
[SPEAKER_31]: So what's this on board elevation here then?

1504
01:55:15,576 --> 01:55:17,398
[SPEAKER_31]: It says preview board elevation.

1505
01:55:19,533 --> 01:55:20,253
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, I'm sorry.

1506
01:55:20,373 --> 01:55:21,334
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, I see what you're talking about.

1507
01:55:21,694 --> 01:55:22,815
[SPEAKER_04]: That's part of the drive-through.

1508
01:55:22,895 --> 01:55:26,138
[SPEAKER_04]: So in the back of the building, there will be a menu board.

1509
01:55:26,278 --> 01:55:31,542
[SPEAKER_04]: So as you're coming through, as you're driving through as a guest, you're going to come to a clearance bar.

1510
01:55:32,343 --> 01:55:33,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Then there'll be a preview board.

1511
01:55:34,304 --> 01:55:37,187
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there'll be the menu board and a speaker canopy all together.

1512
01:55:38,067 --> 01:55:42,251
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you'll turn the corner to the drive-through.

1513
01:55:42,611 --> 01:55:47,114
[SPEAKER_04]: These are actually all on the site plan that you have previously approved behind the building.

1514
01:55:49,297 --> 01:55:51,138
[SPEAKER_31]: So what constitutes assignment?

1515
01:55:51,278 --> 01:55:52,238
[SPEAKER_31]: This would not be assigned.

1516
01:55:52,278 --> 01:55:53,919
[SPEAKER_31]: This is part of the bottom large letter.

1517
01:55:53,959 --> 01:55:56,259
[SPEAKER_04]: So it does have that on there.

1518
01:55:56,339 --> 01:55:57,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Specifically, I don't know.

1519
01:55:57,440 --> 01:55:58,860
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why we gave you everything.

1520
01:55:58,980 --> 01:56:02,161
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why we're just showing you everything here.

1521
01:56:03,122 --> 01:56:08,064
[SPEAKER_31]: Mr. President, I don't know if Council and I found it, but I was able to.

1522
01:56:08,664 --> 01:56:11,205
[SPEAKER_26]: We sent them in the back room to meet with the residents, if you recall.

1523
01:56:11,805 --> 01:56:14,826
[SPEAKER_26]: And then they came out, and they reached some sort of agreement.

1524
01:56:15,926 --> 01:56:18,107
[SPEAKER_26]: But I have not found it, to make the answer short.

1525
01:56:21,258 --> 01:56:35,504
[SPEAKER_31]: Mr. President, I know this gentleman's here for the signage, but the residents in the area, particularly in fourth street and on Riverside have very concerned with the dirt mounds at the location.

1526
01:56:36,424 --> 01:56:49,209
[SPEAKER_31]: Uh, the excavating has been done for quite some time and residents were told by a meeting they had in the neighborhood, I think it was last week or the prior week that, uh, that dirt was going to be counted off site.

1527
01:56:50,195 --> 01:56:55,781
[SPEAKER_31]: And now we're having a major storm tonight that's going to blow around a lot of dirt and debris.

1528
01:56:56,582 --> 01:57:01,126
[SPEAKER_31]: And what's taking so long to remove a giant mound of dirt?

1529
01:57:01,486 --> 01:57:02,608
[SPEAKER_04]: I have absolutely no idea.

1530
01:57:03,088 --> 01:57:05,130
[SPEAKER_04]: So I am not with the landlord.

1531
01:57:05,370 --> 01:57:06,572
[SPEAKER_04]: I am with the tenant fit out.

1532
01:57:06,732 --> 01:57:12,517
[SPEAKER_04]: So once the landlord develops the building, then we'll come in and do the fit out of the actual restaurant itself or the restaurants.

1533
01:57:14,448 --> 01:57:19,710
[SPEAKER_04]: I did speak with Mike Luongo of 4th Street yesterday.

1534
01:57:19,890 --> 01:57:20,791
[SPEAKER_04]: It had to be yesterday.

1535
01:57:21,191 --> 01:57:23,792
[SPEAKER_04]: I spoke with him yesterday, and he expressed his concern.

1536
01:57:23,852 --> 01:57:29,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I also spoke with Carol McLaughlin yesterday morning on St.

1537
01:57:29,534 --> 01:57:30,754
[SPEAKER_04]: James.

1538
01:57:31,194 --> 01:57:36,836
[SPEAKER_04]: She also expressed her concern, and I mentioned it in an email to the landowner, the developer.

1539
01:57:37,737 --> 01:57:40,738
[SPEAKER_31]: Mr. President, can we send a letter to the landlord developer

1540
01:57:41,698 --> 01:57:51,005
[SPEAKER_31]: and developer asking that the dirt, which has to be about 15 to 18 feet high, the length of the property, be removed.

1541
01:57:51,905 --> 01:57:53,246
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. Clerk, do you have that?

1542
01:57:53,306 --> 01:58:08,997
[SPEAKER_21]: The landlord received a letter from the city council requesting that the immediate removal from the wall of dirt that seems to be plaguing the neighborhood and is such a concern for the neighbors.

1543
01:58:13,025 --> 01:58:14,266
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll also inform him this evening.

1544
01:58:14,626 --> 01:58:14,946
[SPEAKER_20]: Please.

1545
01:58:19,249 --> 01:58:21,150
[SPEAKER_20]: How is our archival search proceeding?

1546
01:58:21,390 --> 01:58:21,991
[SPEAKER_26]: Not so hot.

1547
01:58:24,512 --> 01:58:34,258
[SPEAKER_26]: I'd move for approval, Mr. President, based on the contingency that if there are any restrictions on the permit, that they remain in effect when we approve the convict.

1548
01:58:35,959 --> 01:58:37,740
[SPEAKER_21]: So on that motion, all those in favor?

1549
01:58:37,760 --> 01:58:38,981
[SPEAKER_21]: Aye.

1550
01:58:39,401 --> 01:58:40,162
[SPEAKER_21]: All those opposed?

1551
01:58:43,934 --> 01:58:47,775
[SPEAKER_21]: Next, we have 554.

1552
01:58:47,815 --> 01:58:47,775
554, 15554.

1553
01:58:49,696 --> 01:58:56,459
[SPEAKER_21]: Petition for reversal of signed denial by Jeffrey Sauer of Batten Brothers for Noodles & Company, 491 Riverside Ave.

1554
01:58:56,900 --> 01:58:57,520
[SPEAKER_21]: Measured Mass.

1555
01:58:57,580 --> 01:58:59,541
[SPEAKER_21]: OCD application 2015-11-D.

1556
01:59:01,121 --> 01:59:03,222
[SPEAKER_21]: Only one secondary allowed.

1557
01:59:03,663 --> 01:59:07,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Noodle.

1558
01:59:07,804 --> 01:59:10,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Same story, different address, and minus a drive-thru.

1559
01:59:15,612 --> 01:59:16,834
[SPEAKER_04]: I really don't have anything different to say.

1560
01:59:16,874 --> 01:59:17,996
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's the same story we would have.

1561
01:59:18,016 --> 01:59:20,981
[SPEAKER_04]: We're requesting three signs, the front, the rear, and on the side.

1562
01:59:22,843 --> 01:59:32,446
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I mentioned before, but I did speak with Mike Luongo and Carol McLaughlin yesterday about this specifically, and I assured them that it's not something that there's going to be a light that's projecting into you.

1563
01:59:32,526 --> 01:59:34,547
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really just lighting up the sign.

1564
01:59:34,567 --> 01:59:37,788
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no projection, so it's just there.

1565
01:59:38,088 --> 01:59:47,631
[SPEAKER_21]: And a lot of the signage is conformity with requirements of the franchisee meets a national standard for the brand.

1566
01:59:47,832 --> 01:59:48,372
[SPEAKER_04]: That is correct.

1567
01:59:48,392 --> 01:59:50,112
[SPEAKER_04]: Panera and noodles, that's exactly correct.

1568
01:59:50,132 --> 01:59:51,833
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually smaller than the other one, it looks like.

1569
01:59:54,177 --> 01:59:55,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilman Marks, you had something.

1570
01:59:55,358 --> 02:00:01,943
[SPEAKER_31]: Well, I was just wondering, are you saying that both these companies require three primary signs?

1571
02:00:02,544 --> 02:00:03,505
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's not what I'm saying.

1572
02:00:04,566 --> 02:00:05,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I'm not sure.

1573
02:00:06,467 --> 02:00:11,471
[SPEAKER_04]: What question I answered was, are these signs typical signage for the brands?

1574
02:00:11,792 --> 02:00:14,234
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I heard you say, and that's what I was answering.

1575
02:00:14,634 --> 02:00:16,656
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as size, is that what you're asking?

1576
02:00:16,816 --> 02:00:19,037
[SPEAKER_31]: Well, I mean, you're requesting three signs.

1577
02:00:19,318 --> 02:00:19,758
[SPEAKER_31]: Yes.

1578
02:00:19,898 --> 02:00:23,301
[SPEAKER_31]: And if they're typical brand signs, that's one thing.

1579
02:00:24,093 --> 02:00:36,316
[SPEAKER_31]: But to state that there are three signs that would be required by any business or company, I don't understand that.

1580
02:00:36,376 --> 02:00:39,276
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's not what I was intending to say.

1581
02:00:39,576 --> 02:00:42,357
[SPEAKER_21]: And if I could interject here, that's not what I was indicating.

1582
02:00:42,877 --> 02:00:47,398
[SPEAKER_21]: Just that there was a standard of size as far as type and style.

1583
02:00:47,818 --> 02:00:48,418
[SPEAKER_21]: That is correct.

1584
02:00:51,558 --> 02:00:56,441
[SPEAKER_21]: It has to be reflective of the logo and meet a standard of the franchise holder.

1585
02:00:56,701 --> 02:00:57,102
[SPEAKER_21]: Correct.

1586
02:00:57,202 --> 02:00:57,782
[SPEAKER_21]: That is correct.

1587
02:00:58,523 --> 02:01:06,167
[SPEAKER_21]: So Panera has particular colors, but whatever they are, they can't be purple and yellow because that's not their brand.

1588
02:01:06,187 --> 02:01:06,728
[SPEAKER_21]: That's correct.

1589
02:01:08,089 --> 02:01:08,589
[SPEAKER_04]: That's correct.

1590
02:01:13,752 --> 02:01:15,093
[SPEAKER_24]: What are the hours the light's going to be on?

1591
02:01:15,113 --> 02:01:15,934
[SPEAKER_24]: They're going to be on from?

1592
02:01:17,395 --> 02:01:18,876
[SPEAKER_04]: The lights are going to be on from dusk till dawn.

1593
02:01:18,956 --> 02:01:19,436
[SPEAKER_24]: Dusk till dawn.

1594
02:01:21,748 --> 02:01:22,969
[SPEAKER_04]: They're on a photo cell.

1595
02:01:27,553 --> 02:01:29,735
[SPEAKER_04]: And I apologize, I neglected to mention this.

1596
02:01:31,517 --> 02:01:44,148
[SPEAKER_04]: On the Panera, going back to the Panera, there was one sign that is in your drawings and shown, but it wasn't specifically mentioned, is on the front of the building, there's a small drive-through oval.

1597
02:01:47,472 --> 02:01:48,993
[SPEAKER_04]: on the left side as you're facing the building.

1598
02:01:49,733 --> 02:01:50,774
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been everywhere.

1599
02:01:50,794 --> 02:01:54,476
[SPEAKER_04]: It just, for some reason, was not added as part of the signage.

1600
02:01:54,496 --> 02:01:56,738
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just want to be clear about that.

1601
02:01:56,758 --> 02:01:59,620
[SPEAKER_17]: So the motion.

1602
02:02:01,501 --> 02:02:02,301
[SPEAKER_17]: Do we have a motion?

1603
02:02:05,083 --> 02:02:07,043
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion for approval from Councilor Camuso.

1604
02:02:07,063 --> 02:02:07,744
[SPEAKER_21]: All those in favor?

1605
02:02:08,184 --> 02:02:08,444
[SPEAKER_21]: Aye.

1606
02:02:08,764 --> 02:02:09,344
[SPEAKER_21]: Opposed?

1607
02:02:09,364 --> 02:02:10,804
[SPEAKER_21]: Motion carries.

1608
02:02:10,884 --> 02:02:12,305
[SPEAKER_21]: Congratulations on the sign.

1609
02:02:12,325 --> 02:02:12,705
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1610
02:02:12,725 --> 02:02:14,585
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion to revert back to regular order of business, Mr. President.

Alton Memorial Auditorium, City Hall, 825 George P. Hassett Drive, Medford, Massachusetts, Tuesday evening, June 23rd, 2015 at 7 p.m.

1612
02:02:34,317 --> 02:02:57,647

1624
02:03:44,509 --> 02:03:48,191

1625
02:03:48,751 --> 02:03:49,351
[SPEAKER_04]: I am in favor.

1626
02:03:49,611 --> 02:03:50,012
[SPEAKER_21]: Very good.

1627
02:03:50,092 --> 02:03:51,212
[SPEAKER_21]: Anybody else in favor?

1628
02:03:51,292 --> 02:03:51,512
[SPEAKER_21]: No.

1629
02:03:51,772 --> 02:03:52,833
[SPEAKER_21]: Anybody else in favor?

1630
02:03:52,913 --> 02:03:55,754
[SPEAKER_21]: Present yourself to the podium and make yourself known.

1631
02:03:56,274 --> 02:03:59,596
[SPEAKER_21]: Hearing and seeing none, I declare that portion of the meeting closed.

1632
02:04:00,389 --> 02:04:08,391
[SPEAKER_21]: Anybody in opposition to extended hours of operation at near bread on Riverside Avenue operating from five to seven?

1633
02:04:08,872 --> 02:04:13,293
[SPEAKER_21]: Anybody in opposition, please present yourself to the podium and make yourself known.

1634

1635
02:04:22,736 --> 02:04:26,597
[SPEAKER_29]: Mr. President, why do you want to be open at five o'clock?

1636
02:04:27,933 --> 02:04:29,794
[SPEAKER_04]: The traffic and— What traffic?

1637
02:04:29,894 --> 02:04:31,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the business, I should say.

1638
02:04:31,894 --> 02:04:34,235
[SPEAKER_04]: The business will dictate—is what dictates that.

1639
02:04:34,655 --> 02:04:37,135
[SPEAKER_29]: Your other Panera stores don't open at this hour?

1640
02:04:37,175 --> 02:04:41,376
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have many drive-thrus, and we believe that's what's going to drive this time.

1641
02:04:41,456 --> 02:04:42,056
[SPEAKER_04]: I shouldn't say that.

1642
02:04:42,317 --> 02:04:53,079
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have that many drive-thrus in the Massachusetts area, and the ones that do are—we'd like to be open that early.

1643
02:04:53,939 --> 02:04:56,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Approximately two months ago, I met with Tony and Sandy's civil

1644
02:04:57,475 --> 02:05:00,856
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to get this one wrong, sorry, Civita Riali.

1645
02:05:02,096 --> 02:05:07,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Michael and Lorraine Luongo and Carol and John McLaughlin, and we spoke about this specifically.

1646
02:05:08,418 --> 02:05:13,500
[SPEAKER_04]: And among other things around liquor for the noodles and as well as packets.

1647
02:05:13,540 --> 02:05:14,720
[SPEAKER_29]: And what did they say about this?

1648
02:05:14,960 --> 02:05:18,441
[SPEAKER_04]: And they all were, they all said they would have no problem with this.

1649
02:05:19,001 --> 02:05:21,962
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, I got an email tonight from Mr. McLaughlin, and he's opposed to it.

1650
02:05:22,042 --> 02:05:23,823
[SPEAKER_29]: So I don't know where you're getting your information from.

1651
02:05:24,207 --> 02:05:25,308
[SPEAKER_04]: I sat right next to him.

1652
02:05:25,408 --> 02:05:25,908
[SPEAKER_04]: When was this?

1653
02:05:26,068 --> 02:05:28,410
[SPEAKER_04]: At the Bertucci's approximately two months ago.

1654
02:05:28,430 --> 02:05:30,091
[SPEAKER_29]: That's two months ago compared to now.

1655
02:05:30,672 --> 02:05:36,156
[SPEAKER_29]: You understand, as Councilor Marks just alluded to, that mound of dirt has caused a tremendous amount of problem.

1656
02:05:36,416 --> 02:05:37,837
[SPEAKER_29]: There's a lady who lives across the street.

1657
02:05:40,059 --> 02:05:41,740
[SPEAKER_11]: Point of information, Councilor Camuso.

1658
02:05:41,880 --> 02:05:45,523
[SPEAKER_11]: The dirt was addressed by the due diligence of Councilor Marks already.

1659
02:05:47,384 --> 02:05:52,448
[SPEAKER_29]: The fact of the matter is that that mound of dirt has caused a tremendous amount of consternation over there, not only to the

1660
02:05:52,832 --> 02:05:55,074
[SPEAKER_29]: lady across the street, but it's found itself over the St.

1661
02:05:55,094 --> 02:05:56,256
[SPEAKER_29]: James road and fourth street.

1662
02:05:56,756 --> 02:06:04,565
[SPEAKER_29]: Um, and since all the neighbors are not in agreement of this, and I just can't understand why, you know, you don't have any drive-thrus, it's, it's, it's bad enough.

1663
02:06:04,625 --> 02:06:06,567
[SPEAKER_29]: It's going to be huge, major congestion over there.

1664
02:06:07,348 --> 02:06:10,811
[SPEAKER_29]: The neighbors, nobody's, nobody's going to get a benefit out of this except noodles.

1665
02:06:10,871 --> 02:06:14,255
[SPEAKER_29]: And you know, everyone else has to conform to regular hours of operation.

1666
02:06:14,738 --> 02:06:20,360
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't see any need right now yet for this, so I would not be voting for approval at this time for this.

1667
02:06:20,540 --> 02:06:21,180
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President?

1668
02:06:21,620 --> 02:06:22,461
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Camuso.

1669
02:06:22,601 --> 02:06:25,202
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I look at this a little bit differently than Councilor Penta.

1670
02:06:26,362 --> 02:06:28,823
[SPEAKER_11]: The need for this isn't just the business, it's the consumer.

1671
02:06:29,543 --> 02:06:30,283
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the consumer.

1672
02:06:30,623 --> 02:06:39,847
[SPEAKER_11]: If you go 10, 15 feet right next to this new development, you have Dunkin' Donuts that opens at 5 a.m., and they also have the business right behind it that is cooking all night long.

1673
02:06:40,367 --> 02:06:44,028
[SPEAKER_11]: So in today's day and age, I know the council has been here for a long time,

1674
02:06:44,485 --> 02:06:56,849
[SPEAKER_11]: drive-through is a fairly new thing but people actually drive right by Dunkin Donuts in other parts of the community to go to a drive-through similar to the bank I know more people that drive right by Brookline Bank down in Medford Square or in West Medford

1675
02:06:57,193 --> 02:06:59,575
[SPEAKER_11]: to go to the drive-through because they have children in the back seat.

1676
02:07:00,055 --> 02:07:04,579
[SPEAKER_11]: So just to be with today's day and age, I don't have any problem with this.

1677
02:07:04,939 --> 02:07:06,740
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's good for the consumer.

1678
02:07:07,261 --> 02:07:12,965
[SPEAKER_11]: And quite honestly, if they don't have the demand and it's not the consumers that are using it, then they're going to push the hours back, I'm sure.

1679
02:07:13,345 --> 02:07:14,846
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is going to be consumer-driven.

1680
02:07:15,647 --> 02:07:20,490
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is why this is something that is a good, positive thing for economic development.

1681
02:07:20,811 --> 02:07:25,234
[SPEAKER_11]: This is not something that was around in the 70s or in the 80s, but today in 2015,

1682
02:07:26,842 --> 02:07:32,826
[SPEAKER_11]: This is something that people look for, and this is something that I think I do support, Mr. President.

1683
02:07:33,486 --> 02:07:33,826
[SPEAKER_11]: Very good.

1684
02:07:34,047 --> 02:07:34,607
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight.

1685
02:07:35,848 --> 02:07:38,269
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. President, I find the paperwork in order, and I move for approval.

1686
02:07:38,289 --> 02:07:39,030
[SPEAKER_21]: Second.

1687
02:07:39,090 --> 02:07:42,732
[SPEAKER_21]: A motion for approval, seconded by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Camuso.

1688
02:07:43,673 --> 02:07:47,375
[SPEAKER_21]: On that motion for approval, Vice President Longo Kern.

1689
02:07:47,575 --> 02:07:48,996
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, President De La Ruzo.

1690
02:07:49,036 --> 02:07:55,100
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to put a review on this, if we could have, whether it be three or six.

1691
02:07:56,160 --> 02:08:12,031
[SPEAKER_07]: month review and a one-year review so that we have the right to obviously withdraw the permission to open 5-7, that way we can see how it's going, see what response we get from the neighbourhood, see if everything's going smoothly.

1692
02:08:12,652 --> 02:08:16,134
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I'd like to amend the paper as such.

1693
02:08:16,595 --> 02:08:17,015
[SPEAKER_21]: Very good.

1694
02:08:17,055 --> 02:08:23,500
[SPEAKER_21]: So on the motion for approval by Councillor Knight, seconded by Councillor Camuso, amended

1695
02:08:26,868 --> 02:08:33,530
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice President Ludlow-Kern to require a three or six-month review?

1696
02:08:34,431 --> 02:08:36,491
[SPEAKER_07]: Six months and a 12-month review.

1697
02:08:36,771 --> 02:08:40,133
[SPEAKER_21]: Six and a 12-month review on that.

1698
02:08:40,253 --> 02:08:42,213
[SPEAKER_21]: Can I ask what that means specifically?

1699
02:08:42,473 --> 02:08:56,178
[SPEAKER_21]: So that in six months, you're required to appear back before the council once you've opened and operated with the drive-through, and then the councillors will review the petition,

1700
02:08:57,007 --> 02:09:12,493
[SPEAKER_21]: And based upon any feedback we get from neighbors, consumers, et cetera, if there is any problems with this, the license permission to have the extended hours of operation will be withdrawn.

1701
02:09:13,034 --> 02:09:16,115
[SPEAKER_21]: And that will also be done in the subsequent six months.

1702
02:09:16,675 --> 02:09:23,998
[SPEAKER_21]: And then oftentimes within those periods of time, any issues can be resolved in that review.

1703
02:09:24,803 --> 02:09:34,534
[SPEAKER_21]: Or if a teen seems to be a chronic issue, then the counselors may feel that it's not appropriate to have a drive-through from 5 to 7.

1704
02:09:36,318 --> 02:09:44,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me just say, which also may help this a little bit, so we have people there at 4 o'clock in the morning, whether we're open at 5 o'clock or not.

1705
02:09:44,765 --> 02:09:49,009
[SPEAKER_04]: If we're open at 5 o'clock or 7 o'clock, we're there at 4 o'clock preparing for the day.

1706
02:09:49,770 --> 02:09:51,691
[SPEAKER_04]: That's another big reason why we're open.

1707
02:09:52,152 --> 02:09:54,254
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't expect from 5 to 6 or 6 to 7 to be open.

1708
02:09:56,723 --> 02:09:58,063
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, all of a sudden an influx.

1709
02:09:58,143 --> 02:10:08,066
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the, you know, the big grocers are open 24 hours because they're there 24 hours and there's not a large increased cost to be open those hours.

1710
02:10:08,106 --> 02:10:17,908
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's, I don't think, I'm confident that when we come back in six months and come back in 12 months, you will have no complaints and it will be quick and painless.

1711
02:10:18,769 --> 02:10:23,810
[SPEAKER_21]: We've not had any significant issue on any of the other operative drive-throughs.

1712
02:10:24,441 --> 02:10:26,942
[SPEAKER_21]: in the city that we've been made aware of.

1713
02:10:27,742 --> 02:10:34,503
[SPEAKER_21]: And we certainly don't want you to feel as though you're being put in a position here.

1714
02:10:35,203 --> 02:10:39,544
[SPEAKER_21]: But we are clear about one thing, and that's we're concerned for the neighbors.

1715
02:10:40,545 --> 02:10:46,006
[SPEAKER_21]: We're concerned about matters of traffic and for people's safety in the neighborhood.

1716
02:10:46,866 --> 02:10:47,546
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Marks.

1717
02:10:48,606 --> 02:10:49,627
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1718
02:10:50,307 --> 02:10:51,807
[SPEAKER_31]: You alluded to outdoor seating.

1719
02:10:52,447 --> 02:10:52,607
[SPEAKER_31]: Yes.

1720
02:10:52,847 --> 02:10:55,969
[SPEAKER_31]: Can you elaborate a little more on what the plans are?

1721
02:10:57,130 --> 02:11:00,432
[SPEAKER_04]: They're in my car, because it's not on tonight's agenda.

1722
02:11:00,592 --> 02:11:09,437
[SPEAKER_04]: But we have, for the Panera and for the noodles, we're trying to get on tonight's meeting, but we'll be in hopefully your next meeting or hearing for this.

1723
02:11:10,658 --> 02:11:15,561
[SPEAKER_04]: In the noodles, because there will be liquor, there is a, and I shouldn't say liquor, there's a beer and wine.

1724
02:11:15,861 --> 02:11:16,662
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no hard alcohol.

1725
02:11:19,596 --> 02:11:24,260
[SPEAKER_04]: But there is a gated patio that can only be entered in from the interior of the restaurant.

1726
02:11:24,600 --> 02:11:26,682
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a gate with an alarm on there.

1727
02:11:26,742 --> 02:11:29,284
[SPEAKER_04]: So if there's an emergency, people can leave.

1728
02:11:29,804 --> 02:11:30,865
[SPEAKER_04]: But the alarm will go off.

1729
02:11:30,945 --> 02:11:34,187
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's contained appropriately.

1730
02:11:35,749 --> 02:11:45,716
[SPEAKER_04]: There's approximately 16, I believe there's 16 seats in that, on the noodle side, ADA compliant pathways.

1731
02:11:48,580 --> 02:11:49,741
[SPEAKER_04]: and so on.

1732
02:11:49,781 --> 02:12:01,670
[SPEAKER_04]: The Panera is not gated, there is no alcohol, and it's, I can't tell you the number of seats, I don't know off the top of my head, but they're on the sidewalk in front of the restaurant.

1733
02:12:02,231 --> 02:12:07,815
[SPEAKER_31]: On the sidewalk, so with the noodles, you have to enter the restaurant in order to get to the outdoor patio.

1734
02:12:08,075 --> 02:12:12,639
[SPEAKER_04]: That is correct, it's on the side of the building, it's on, well, on the side.

1735
02:12:13,119 --> 02:12:15,481
[SPEAKER_31]: Now, did that always exist?

1736
02:12:15,501 --> 02:12:17,863
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't ever recall outdoor seating when,

1737
02:12:18,827 --> 02:12:20,708
[SPEAKER_31]: this concept came up originally.

1738
02:12:20,748 --> 02:12:21,889
[SPEAKER_31]: Was that always part of the plan?

1739
02:12:23,110 --> 02:12:25,652
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't tell you what was presented to you originally.

1740
02:12:26,472 --> 02:12:26,892
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1741
02:12:27,573 --> 02:12:30,935
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always been in our plans.

1742
02:12:30,995 --> 02:12:33,417
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always been in our plans to the landlord.

1743
02:12:34,738 --> 02:12:37,479
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't tell you what, I don't know what they presented to you initially.

1744
02:12:38,020 --> 02:12:45,785
[SPEAKER_31]: And when you talk about noodles, the seating will be on a sidewalk that is around the perimeter of the building.

1745
02:12:46,458 --> 02:12:49,219
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on the side of the building, correct, on the Noodle side of the building.

1746
02:12:49,259 --> 02:12:50,219
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know my north-south.

1747
02:12:50,819 --> 02:12:52,440
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm talking about Panera now.

1748
02:12:52,500 --> 02:12:52,600
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

1749
02:12:52,640 --> 02:12:54,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, the Panera will be on the front of the building.

1750
02:12:55,181 --> 02:12:59,922
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're still, where they're located, it still maintains egress.

1751
02:13:00,363 --> 02:13:08,105
[SPEAKER_04]: So the tables that are on the closest to the drive lane have umbrellas, which have a 150-pound base.

1752
02:13:08,605 --> 02:13:10,366
[SPEAKER_04]: So the tables can't easily be moved.

1753
02:13:10,966 --> 02:13:13,187
[SPEAKER_04]: So that way, you're maintaining a walkway.

1754
02:13:15,312 --> 02:13:17,853
[SPEAKER_31]: And how wide is that seating area?

1755
02:13:19,313 --> 02:13:20,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, I'm sorry.

1756
02:13:20,053 --> 02:13:23,054
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't planning to talk about this, so I can't tell you specifically.

1757
02:13:23,074 --> 02:13:29,976
[SPEAKER_04]: But I can tell you that there's enough room for the tables and an appropriate code compliant walkway.

1758
02:13:30,016 --> 02:13:32,677
[SPEAKER_31]: So you plan on being back before us within the next week or so?

1759
02:13:35,230 --> 02:13:44,295
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know when we're on, we've been working with Sheila in your office, in the clerk's office, so I don't know when, shortly is what I'll be able to tell you.

1760
02:13:44,615 --> 02:13:45,976
[SPEAKER_31]: I'll reserve my question until I come back.

1761
02:13:46,396 --> 02:14:00,063
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, and for your information, as you're working with the officials here in Medford regarding outdoor seating, I'm sure they'll be informing you on whatever zoning and or Board of Health issues there are that you'll need to be compliant with.

1762
02:14:00,083 --> 02:14:00,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, yes.

1763
02:14:00,904 --> 02:14:04,926
[SPEAKER_21]: So we have a motion for approval by President Camuso,

1764
02:14:05,855 --> 02:14:10,756
[SPEAKER_21]: seconded by President Camuso, by Councilor Knight, with the review amended, Councilor Camuso.

1765
02:14:10,956 --> 02:14:17,018
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, and you brought up a very good point regarding a lot of the other establishments that have extended hours.

1766
02:14:18,058 --> 02:14:32,562
[SPEAKER_11]: I would say the majority, well yes, at least two-thirds of this body, has supported extended hours and has been very economic development friendly when it comes to special permits, the majority of the Council.

1767
02:14:32,922 --> 02:14:33,662
[SPEAKER_11]: With that being said,

1768
02:14:34,778 --> 02:14:39,142
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't recall one coming back to us for a show cause hearing on a special permit.

1769
02:14:39,282 --> 02:14:47,550
[SPEAKER_11]: The only show cause hearing I can remember in recent times was the pawn shop up on Boston Avenue.

1770
02:14:48,371 --> 02:14:52,935
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I think this is a great economic development paper and I'd like to have a roll call vote on this.

1771
02:14:53,476 --> 02:14:53,916
[SPEAKER_11]: Very good.

1772
02:14:54,817 --> 02:14:58,901
[SPEAKER_20]: We have Councilor Penta requesting to speak on this.

1773
02:14:58,961 --> 02:15:00,362
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, I'm just confused.

1774
02:15:01,182 --> 02:15:01,943
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm really concerned.

1775
02:15:01,963 --> 02:15:07,908
[SPEAKER_29]: You're telling me you met with the neighbors and they said, okay, and I'm getting emails from them and they're saying no.

1776
02:15:07,928 --> 02:15:08,208
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay.

1777
02:15:08,388 --> 02:15:19,077
[SPEAKER_04]: I, I, myself and the operator of the noodles and the operator of the Panera that are going to be there full time met with this, the three couples that I mentioned.

1778
02:15:19,878 --> 02:15:23,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I can't tell you the date off hand, but I can tell you it was at the Bertucci's.

1779
02:15:23,901 --> 02:15:24,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, we met in the back room.

1780
02:15:24,902 --> 02:15:26,563
[SPEAKER_04]: We were there for approximately two hours.

1781
02:15:27,184 --> 02:15:29,566
[SPEAKER_04]: And my last statement to the three couples was,

1782
02:15:30,540 --> 02:15:34,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anything that is going to come up that I should know about?

1783
02:15:34,243 --> 02:15:44,591
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to make sure that I'm addressing every one of your concerns when it comes to conversations around a beer and wine license, regarding a patio, regarding opening early.

1784
02:15:44,611 --> 02:15:50,975
[SPEAKER_04]: And I didn't know about the signs at that point, so we didn't have that conversation.

1785
02:15:51,055 --> 02:15:51,676
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Cluso.

1786
02:15:51,836 --> 02:15:56,760
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we're all aware of very, very nice people that live in the neighborhood.

1787
02:15:56,780 --> 02:15:59,582
[SPEAKER_11]: We all received the calls over the last few days.

1788
02:16:00,260 --> 02:16:09,286
[SPEAKER_11]: And no one works harder to keep their neighborhood a great positive area to live in than the gentlemen that were just spoken about.

1789
02:16:11,008 --> 02:16:15,371
[SPEAKER_11]: I am fully confident that with the reviews that they'll be happy.

1790
02:16:15,631 --> 02:16:17,532
[SPEAKER_11]: And if not at that time, then we'll look at it.

1791
02:16:17,972 --> 02:16:26,038
[SPEAKER_11]: But let's look back to when this was A&W, when it was a pretty lighted area, this particular parcel, and it was vacant for

1792
02:16:27,126 --> 02:16:33,931
[SPEAKER_11]: three, four, five years to the point where people were coming to this honorable body complaining about the weeds and everything else.

1793
02:16:34,872 --> 02:16:43,338
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just, I don't take lightly their phone calls and they're advocating for their neighborhood, but this is in the best interest of the city of Medford.

1794
02:16:43,819 --> 02:16:52,045
[SPEAKER_11]: And at some point within three or six or nine months down the road from the inception of it opening, if there's problems, we will deal with it appropriately.

1795
02:16:53,247 --> 02:17:00,192
[SPEAKER_04]: And these couples all have my contact information, as well as the operators of each concept's contact information.

1796
02:17:00,232 --> 02:17:03,554
[SPEAKER_04]: They've obviously reached out to me already when we talked about the signs.

1797
02:17:03,634 --> 02:17:04,895
[SPEAKER_04]: So they know they can reach out.

1798
02:17:04,975 --> 02:17:11,500
[SPEAKER_11]: There's obviously a time lapse, too, from you meeting with them a couple months ago to them calling all the members of the council over this weekend.

1799
02:17:11,540 --> 02:17:13,001
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's a time lapse.

1800
02:17:13,041 --> 02:17:14,101
[SPEAKER_11]: And people do change.

1801
02:17:14,562 --> 02:17:14,722
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

1802
02:17:15,022 --> 02:17:16,463
[SPEAKER_11]: And get after them about the dirt.

1803
02:17:18,224 --> 02:17:19,745
[SPEAKER_04]: I will send them an email this evening.

1804
02:17:20,005 --> 02:17:20,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Please.

1805
02:17:20,426 --> 02:17:21,086
[SPEAKER_20]: Counselor Penton.

1806
02:17:21,416 --> 02:17:21,796
[SPEAKER_20]: You all set?

1807
02:17:22,076 --> 02:17:22,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1808
02:17:22,477 --> 02:17:22,757
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sorry.

1809
02:17:23,197 --> 02:17:25,198
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm council angle.

1810
02:17:25,238 --> 02:17:28,360
[SPEAKER_29]: Kern brings up a good point and I'm, this has got me confused.

1811
02:17:28,400 --> 02:17:31,041
[SPEAKER_29]: All right, I'm going to tell you that they'll tell you one thing and I'm doing another.

1812
02:17:31,421 --> 02:17:32,042
[SPEAKER_29]: I have no problem.

1813
02:17:32,382 --> 02:17:38,225
[SPEAKER_29]: I'll vote for it, but I want to change it to a three month or six month in the year return three times within the year.

1814
02:17:38,265 --> 02:17:38,805
[SPEAKER_29]: So let's see.

1815
02:17:40,286 --> 02:17:40,526
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay.

1816
02:17:40,546 --> 02:17:41,347
[SPEAKER_29]: We'll just review it.

1817
02:17:41,367 --> 02:17:43,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, I'm, I'm not concerned.

1818
02:17:44,048 --> 02:17:44,288
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay.

1819
02:17:44,508 --> 02:17:47,030
[SPEAKER_04]: I can tell you we're a, we are not a, we are not,

1820
02:17:48,190 --> 02:17:49,991
[SPEAKER_04]: a huge company or a family company.

1821
02:17:50,011 --> 02:17:57,235
[SPEAKER_29]: That's fair enough, but I'm just saying, you have to understand, you know, when you get phone calls from neighbors and you get emails and it's contrary to what you're telling them.

1822
02:17:57,255 --> 02:17:59,016
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm not going to call them.

1823
02:17:59,096 --> 02:18:03,338
[SPEAKER_29]: So I don't know what happened from two months to now to have anyone change their mind if that's what they did.

1824
02:18:03,798 --> 02:18:06,560
[SPEAKER_29]: But I could go along with a three month, a six month and a year.

1825
02:18:06,900 --> 02:18:08,661
[SPEAKER_21]: So as amended by Councilor Penta,

1826
02:18:09,135 --> 02:18:12,878
[SPEAKER_21]: to make it a three, six, and 12-month review.

1827
02:18:13,759 --> 02:18:23,767
[SPEAKER_21]: So on the motion for approval by Councilor Knight, as amended by Councilors Longo, Kern, and Penta, seconded by Camuso, we have a citizen who needs to talk.

1828
02:18:24,187 --> 02:18:25,148
[SPEAKER_21]: Let me not forget him.

1829
02:18:25,578 --> 02:18:27,500
[SPEAKER_21]: And we're going to let Councilor Marks talk.

1830
02:18:27,560 --> 02:18:29,342
[SPEAKER_21]: Just a quick question, Mr. President, if I could.

1831
02:18:31,704 --> 02:18:32,405
[SPEAKER_31]: The drive-thru.

1832
02:18:32,425 --> 02:18:33,046
[SPEAKER_31]: Yes.

1833
02:18:33,887 --> 02:18:38,872
[SPEAKER_31]: If I want to get one of your egg and cheese sandwiches in the morning, can I use the drive-thru?

1834
02:18:38,892 --> 02:18:39,132
[SPEAKER_31]: Yep.

1835
02:18:39,913 --> 02:18:41,575
[SPEAKER_31]: These are all pre-made, pre-prepared?

1836
02:18:41,595 --> 02:18:41,715
[SPEAKER_31]: Nope.

1837
02:18:43,196 --> 02:18:43,276
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1838
02:18:47,434 --> 02:18:48,074
[SPEAKER_04]: It's interesting.

1839
02:18:48,775 --> 02:18:50,316
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't a believer until I saw it.

1840
02:18:50,896 --> 02:18:58,682
[SPEAKER_04]: So actually, the speed of service is extremely important, and it's actually faster when you go through a drive-through of a Panera than when you come into the inside.

1841
02:18:59,162 --> 02:19:09,670
[SPEAKER_04]: So without giving you a three-hour explanation, the short story is when you come into the restaurant, we could have four, five, or six cash registers, and they're all going to one preparation area.

1842
02:19:10,631 --> 02:19:13,453
[SPEAKER_04]: So you could have six orders at once coming to this preparation area.

1843
02:19:13,573 --> 02:19:17,815
[SPEAKER_04]: In the drive-through, you have one preparation area and one person taking the order.

1844
02:19:19,256 --> 02:19:27,882
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you're placing the order, turkey sandwich, whatever, egg and cheese, whatever, the person that makes the sandwiches has a headset and hears it.

1845
02:19:28,062 --> 02:19:30,483
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're starting to make it while you're talking about it.

1846
02:19:31,784 --> 02:19:36,467
[SPEAKER_31]: So you don't foresee any backup in that particular area if people come down and order sandwiches

1847
02:19:37,499 --> 02:19:39,720
[SPEAKER_04]: No, because everything is made fresh.

1848
02:19:39,760 --> 02:19:42,601
[SPEAKER_04]: So there is nothing pre-made.

1849
02:19:42,621 --> 02:19:43,682
[SPEAKER_04]: There is nothing frozen.

1850
02:19:43,702 --> 02:19:44,802
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1851
02:19:47,684 --> 02:19:48,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Could we run out of bread?

1852
02:19:48,984 --> 02:19:49,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

1853
02:19:49,985 --> 02:19:50,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Could we run out of something?

1854
02:19:51,185 --> 02:19:51,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

1855
02:19:52,366 --> 02:19:54,927
[SPEAKER_04]: But to be a norm, absolutely not.

1856
02:19:54,967 --> 02:19:56,227
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all fresh, made every day.

1857
02:19:56,768 --> 02:19:59,069
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm not disputing whether it's fresh or not.

1858
02:19:59,089 --> 02:20:04,191
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm disputing how long it would take to get through your line if you ordered something other than a cup of coffee.

1859
02:20:04,331 --> 02:20:04,451
[SPEAKER_31]: No.

1860
02:20:07,167 --> 02:20:08,548
[SPEAKER_31]: Do you know what your average wait time is?

1861
02:20:11,609 --> 02:20:12,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Not this second.

1862
02:20:14,950 --> 02:20:17,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Not this second, but it's, it's, I don't know off the top of my head.

1863
02:20:17,871 --> 02:20:32,497
[SPEAKER_31]: Mr. President, the reason why I ask is, uh, you know, I don't want to name any particular establishments, but there's a drive through in Wellington that when you go through the drive through, they ask you to pull into the parking lot and be seated in a parking spot while they're making your food.

1864
02:20:32,517 --> 02:20:33,277
[SPEAKER_31]: And then they come out and,

1865
02:20:33,753 --> 02:20:37,054
[SPEAKER_31]: and deliver your food, which to me defeats the whole purpose of a drive-thru.

1866
02:20:37,114 --> 02:20:42,437
[SPEAKER_04]: So as our franchise, we have eight Panera Breads with drive-thrus currently.

1867
02:20:42,997 --> 02:20:46,758
[SPEAKER_04]: None of them have parking stalls, as you're, whatever you want to call them, pull ahead and wait.

1868
02:20:47,479 --> 02:20:50,880
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know a time that I've ever seen that occur.

1869
02:20:51,680 --> 02:20:54,401
[SPEAKER_31]: So you don't anticipate that at Panera?

1870
02:20:54,481 --> 02:20:57,983
[SPEAKER_04]: If we can't produce it quickly, we will be out of the drive-thru business.

1871
02:20:59,483 --> 02:21:03,325
[SPEAKER_04]: So with all due respect, it's really more of my concern than your concern.

1872
02:21:04,373 --> 02:21:05,794
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't want to wait in line either, so.

1873
02:21:07,195 --> 02:21:09,616
[SPEAKER_20]: We have a motion for approval on the floor.

1874
02:21:10,477 --> 02:21:11,357
[SPEAKER_09]: As amended.

1875
02:21:11,377 --> 02:21:12,918
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Citizen, would you speak, please?

1876
02:21:13,879 --> 02:21:14,299
[SPEAKER_09]: Senator?

1877
02:21:14,539 --> 02:21:15,740
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1878
02:21:15,780 --> 02:21:16,640
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll be very brief.

1879
02:21:16,760 --> 02:21:19,102
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm Robert Capucci, 71 Evans Street.

1880
02:21:21,303 --> 02:21:33,750
[SPEAKER_09]: My concern is that with more traffic on the road, that somehow if you could expedite whatever projects you have in the works to fix the roads that are in dire need of repair and

1881
02:21:34,429 --> 02:21:49,173
[SPEAKER_09]: When drive-throughs have existed in this country for decades, and when one city councilor makes a personal attack on another city councilor's age, but he said it.

1882
02:21:49,253 --> 02:21:51,754
[SPEAKER_09]: It's an affront to every senior citizen.

1883
02:21:54,034 --> 02:21:55,355
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you very much.

1884
02:21:56,835 --> 02:21:58,976
[SPEAKER_21]: Point of information, Councilor Camuso.

1885
02:21:59,516 --> 02:22:00,456
[SPEAKER_11]: Just to clear the record.

1886
02:22:01,052 --> 02:22:07,375
[SPEAKER_11]: I stand by my comments, and I was talking about Councillor Pinto's 30-plus years of service, and the drive-throughs are fairly new.

1887
02:22:07,415 --> 02:22:08,696
[SPEAKER_11]: He's been around here for 30 years.

1888
02:22:08,956 --> 02:22:09,957
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you very much.

1889
02:22:10,397 --> 02:22:12,878
[SPEAKER_21]: Ma'am, please state your name and address for the record.

1890
02:22:14,719 --> 02:22:16,460
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1891
02:22:17,660 --> 02:22:18,781
[SPEAKER_01]: Jean Martin, 10 Cumming Street.

1892
02:22:19,681 --> 02:22:24,264
[SPEAKER_01]: And I— Ms.

1893
02:22:24,304 --> 02:22:24,544
[SPEAKER_21]: Martin.

1894
02:22:26,462 --> 02:22:27,583
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1895
02:22:29,203 --> 02:22:30,304
[SPEAKER_01]: I am pro this business.

1896
02:22:31,164 --> 02:22:31,925
[SPEAKER_01]: I live in that area.

1897
02:22:32,525 --> 02:22:38,968
[SPEAKER_01]: I do take your concern about parking in the backup, but I'm really loving the idea of the Panera Bread.

1898
02:22:39,405 --> 02:22:40,806
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's a gathering place.

1899
02:22:40,966 --> 02:22:45,709
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a place, because I love the Wellington Circle Plaza, what it's turned into.

1900
02:22:46,369 --> 02:22:51,332
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I never comment well on our business districts, but that's one really nice one.

1901
02:22:51,732 --> 02:22:54,133
[SPEAKER_01]: They really did a beautiful job.

1902
02:22:54,474 --> 02:22:59,637
[SPEAKER_01]: What it is missing is a restaurant area where people can come together, gather, and eat.

1903
02:23:00,957 --> 02:23:05,940
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the Stop and Shop and all those places, and the sports store and Models and all of that.

1904
02:23:06,380 --> 02:23:07,041
[SPEAKER_01]: Fantastic.

1905
02:23:07,641 --> 02:23:09,262
[SPEAKER_01]: They do, on the other side of Wellington,

1906
02:23:09,733 --> 02:23:12,114
[SPEAKER_01]: have the burrito place and a couple of others.

1907
02:23:12,414 --> 02:23:16,437
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a nice compliment to the burrito place, and I'm pro it.

1908
02:23:16,777 --> 02:23:20,979
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do remember when it was Happy Hattic, and it was a bustling place when it was Happy Hattic for a long time.

1909
02:23:21,920 --> 02:23:27,082
[SPEAKER_01]: But it did go, Happy Hattic went out, and then it was an empty spot for a long time.

1910
02:23:27,723 --> 02:23:35,507
[SPEAKER_01]: Back to the concern about traffic, and Mr. Marks always talks about this, traffic calming measures need to be thought through.

1911
02:23:35,807 --> 02:23:38,088
[SPEAKER_01]: This doesn't have anything to do with this gentleman here.

1912
02:23:40,122 --> 02:23:44,505
[SPEAKER_01]: When you come up to Wellington Circle, it's supposed to be technically one lane.

1913
02:23:44,785 --> 02:23:47,907
[SPEAKER_01]: We all know they stack three, and then the person takes the right.

1914
02:23:48,307 --> 02:23:51,189
[SPEAKER_01]: There's two lanes without a line down it.

1915
02:23:51,569 --> 02:23:52,430
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very dangerous.

1916
02:23:52,830 --> 02:23:53,971
[SPEAKER_01]: My cousin got in an accident.

1917
02:23:53,991 --> 02:24:04,117
[SPEAKER_01]: She had to pay for the accident because the insurance company said, well, it was one lane, and you were to the right of that, and you technically weren't.

1918
02:24:04,477 --> 02:24:05,858
[SPEAKER_01]: So it becomes an issue.

1919
02:24:06,319 --> 02:24:09,901
[SPEAKER_01]: So the backing up is definitely an issue, so I'm all for.

1920
02:24:10,405 --> 02:24:12,647
[SPEAKER_01]: also the three-month, six-month, or nine-month review.

1921
02:24:12,947 --> 02:24:18,732
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no problem with that because the backup of the cars can be a problem.

1922
02:24:18,913 --> 02:24:20,254
[SPEAKER_01]: But part of that is on the city.

1923
02:24:21,175 --> 02:24:29,782
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to make sure that the traffic pattern at that intersection is also squared away with proper markings, whatever you have to do.

1924
02:24:30,102 --> 02:24:31,424
[SPEAKER_01]: But I am definitely for this.

1925
02:24:31,444 --> 02:24:32,404
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a clean business.

1926
02:24:32,825 --> 02:24:33,646
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a gathering place.

1927
02:24:34,648 --> 02:24:35,108
[SPEAKER_01]: It's awesome.

1928
02:24:35,188 --> 02:24:35,888
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great for the city.

1929
02:24:35,908 --> 02:24:36,709
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great for Wellington.

1930
02:24:37,109 --> 02:24:42,730
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I know I always tear down the business districts, but this is a good one and it's not overdeveloped.

1931
02:24:43,390 --> 02:24:45,451
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoa, I said something positive about the businesses.

1932
02:24:45,931 --> 02:24:46,191
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey.

1933
02:24:46,471 --> 02:24:50,452
[SPEAKER_21]: On the motion for approval by Councillor Knight, seconded by Councillor Camuso, as amended.

1934
02:24:50,492 --> 02:24:51,352
[SPEAKER_21]: All those in favour?

1935
02:24:52,032 --> 02:24:52,773
[SPEAKER_21]: All those opposed?

1936
02:24:52,793 --> 02:24:54,073
[SPEAKER_21]: Motion passes.

1937
02:24:54,113 --> 02:24:54,953
[SPEAKER_21]: Congratulations.

1938
02:24:54,973 --> 02:24:55,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1939
02:24:55,413 --> 02:24:56,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I ask one question?

1940
02:24:56,193 --> 02:24:57,454
[SPEAKER_21]: Motions, orders and resolutions.

1941
02:24:57,974 --> 02:24:58,274
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

1942
02:24:58,627 --> 02:25:01,128
[SPEAKER_04]: just about the three, six, nine, three, six, 12 months.

1943
02:25:01,568 --> 02:25:03,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that automatically going to be scheduled?

1944
02:25:03,308 --> 02:25:04,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I need to appear?

1945
02:25:04,428 --> 02:25:07,629
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, it's from your, uh, uh, Dave operation.

1946
02:25:07,849 --> 02:25:09,389
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll just work with the city clerk's office.

1947
02:25:09,429 --> 02:25:09,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Please do.

1948
02:25:10,109 --> 02:25:10,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1949
02:25:11,230 --> 02:25:13,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1950
02:25:13,610 --> 02:25:15,370
[SPEAKER_21]: 15 five 50 offered by council night.

1951
02:25:15,410 --> 02:25:23,752
[SPEAKER_21]: Be it resolved that the Medford city council extended steep and sincere condolences to the family of Paul Cavanaugh senior on his recent passing.

1952
02:25:24,213 --> 02:25:36,076
[SPEAKER_21]: And while we have this, we have another condolence offered by Councilor Penta that a moment of silence be offered for the passing of former Medford Police Detective John P. Brady.

1953
02:25:36,536 --> 02:25:37,256
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Knight.

1954
02:25:38,336 --> 02:25:39,557
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1955
02:25:40,577 --> 02:25:43,998
[SPEAKER_26]: Over the last couple of years, I've become very friendly with Paul Cavanaugh Jr.

1956
02:25:44,058 --> 02:25:45,278
[SPEAKER_26]: He recently lost his father.

1957
02:25:46,223 --> 02:25:53,548
[SPEAKER_26]: I was unable to make the services last week, however, I did want to extend my deep and sincere condolences to he and his family in their loss, Mr. President.

1958
02:25:53,568 --> 02:25:55,289
[SPEAKER_26]: And I'd ask my council colleagues to do the same.

1959
02:25:55,790 --> 02:25:56,150
[SPEAKER_21]: Very good.

1960
02:25:56,590 --> 02:26:06,497
[SPEAKER_21]: I was negligent and forgot to mention also, but I offered by Councilor Caravaglio, condolences to the family of Arlene O'Neill.

1961
02:26:06,957 --> 02:26:12,241
[SPEAKER_21]: Arlene is the mother of Ed O'Neill, City's solicitor, City Assessor.

1962
02:26:12,821 --> 02:26:13,822
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sorry.

1963
02:26:13,882 --> 02:26:14,542
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Pinto,

1964
02:26:16,424 --> 02:26:17,185
[SPEAKER_21]: Inspector Brady.

1965
02:26:18,245 --> 02:26:23,469
[SPEAKER_29]: Mr. Brady, he retired, I believe, as a lieutenant detective in the Memphis Police Department.

1966
02:26:23,649 --> 02:26:24,729
[SPEAKER_29]: He served many years.

1967
02:26:26,230 --> 02:26:27,071
[SPEAKER_29]: He was a detective.

1968
02:26:30,773 --> 02:26:32,735
[SPEAKER_29]: And he served this community well.

1969
02:26:32,795 --> 02:26:33,715
[SPEAKER_29]: He worked with the FBI.

1970
02:26:33,755 --> 02:26:34,736
[SPEAKER_29]: He worked with the state police.

1971
02:26:34,776 --> 02:26:44,122
[SPEAKER_29]: He was well recognized for his duty as a Memphis police officer in bringing good name and recognition to our community and to his family.

1972
02:26:44,805 --> 02:26:47,587
[SPEAKER_29]: His daughter was a former school committeeman, Hattie Brady.

1973
02:26:48,367 --> 02:26:55,312
[SPEAKER_29]: And to his wife, Mary, and to the rest of the family, I wish them a special, special notice.

1974
02:26:55,932 --> 02:26:57,493
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Caravaggio.

1975
02:26:58,033 --> 02:27:07,879
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, Inspector Brady, very well respected in the Medford Police Department, but also throughout the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in his rank as detective.

1976
02:27:09,640 --> 02:27:12,062
[SPEAKER_11]: He certainly made Medford proud, but he also

1977
02:27:13,064 --> 02:27:14,545
[SPEAKER_11]: did a lot after his retirement.

1978
02:27:14,585 --> 02:27:22,952
[SPEAKER_11]: He was doing private investigative work, and he was often called upon by law enforcement agencies, still, even in retirement.

1979
02:27:22,972 --> 02:27:33,720
[SPEAKER_11]: So I want to send our condolences to him and his family, and his son-in-law, Chris, who worked in this building for many, many years, up until about three or four months ago.

1980
02:27:34,121 --> 02:27:34,321
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1981
02:27:35,302 --> 02:27:35,902
[SPEAKER_31]: Counselor Marks?

1982
02:27:36,643 --> 02:27:36,863
[SPEAKER_31]: Yes.

1983
02:27:37,003 --> 02:27:39,445
[SPEAKER_31]: And also, Mr. President, before we take the moment of silence,

1984
02:27:40,180 --> 02:27:44,961
[SPEAKER_31]: A longtime Method resident, Dominic D'Ambrosio, recently passed away.

1985
02:27:45,981 --> 02:27:48,622
[SPEAKER_31]: If anyone knew Dominic, he'd be the first to help someone out.

1986
02:27:50,282 --> 02:28:00,865
[SPEAKER_31]: Him and his mother had a little shop on Little Prince Street in the North End for a number of years, and they used to be out there with the big green slush bucket and selling slush.

1987
02:28:01,725 --> 02:28:07,326
[SPEAKER_31]: And Dominic also worked for the city of Boston for a number of years under Mayor Ray Flynn.

1988
02:28:08,051 --> 02:28:09,893
[SPEAKER_31]: and was in charge of special events.

1989
02:28:10,834 --> 02:28:20,523
[SPEAKER_31]: And if you knew Dom, he was always one to open up his trunk and come out with all these little gadgets that he got over the years of running different events in the city of Boston.

1990
02:28:20,583 --> 02:28:23,006
[SPEAKER_31]: And he will be sorely missed, Mr. President.

1991
02:28:24,027 --> 02:28:30,153
[SPEAKER_21]: So please join us in a moment of silence for these people connected to our community.

1992
02:28:42,483 --> 02:28:53,487
[SPEAKER_21]: 15551 offered by Councilor Penta, be it resolved that the city administration appropriate $75,000 from free cash to further use in fixing of potholes in our city streets.

1993
02:28:54,247 --> 02:28:54,907
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Penta.

1994
02:28:55,207 --> 02:28:56,488
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to table, Mr. President.

1995
02:28:56,828 --> 02:28:57,408
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Penta.

1996
02:28:57,468 --> 02:28:59,049
[SPEAKER_18]: I get some questions answered for one week.

1997
02:29:01,150 --> 02:29:02,810
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion to table is undebatable.

1998
02:29:02,830 --> 02:29:04,030
[SPEAKER_29]: Roll call vote, Mr. President.

1999
02:29:04,311 --> 02:29:04,611
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry?

2000
02:29:04,631 --> 02:29:04,771
[SPEAKER_18]: Section 22.

2001
02:29:04,811 --> 02:29:05,051
[SPEAKER_18]: Section 22.

2002
02:29:05,091 --> 02:29:07,812
[SPEAKER_11]: I got to get questions answered.

2003
02:29:17,284 --> 02:29:36,939
[SPEAKER_21]: 15555.

2004
02:29:17,845 --> 02:29:36,939
[SPEAKER_21]: Petition by Joseph Viglione, 59 Garfield Avenue, Medford, to address this Medford City Council on the immediate restoration of AXIS TV in an emergency measure for the election of 2015.

2005
02:29:37,840 --> 02:29:40,582
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record, Mr. Viglione.

2006
02:29:40,742 --> 02:29:41,823
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Council President.

2007
02:29:42,043 --> 02:29:45,365
[SPEAKER_10]: Joe Viglione, 59 Garfield Avenue, Medford, Mass.

2008
02:29:45,385 --> 02:29:46,206
[SPEAKER_10]: 16 years ago tomorrow,

2009
02:29:47,493 --> 02:29:54,055
[SPEAKER_10]: As a member of TV3 Medford, I had borrowed a camera and taped my wonderful Nana on her 100th birthday.

2010
02:29:54,955 --> 02:29:59,836
[SPEAKER_10]: And my dad, who was her son-in-law, worked with the woman from the Somerville Journal.

2011
02:29:59,856 --> 02:30:01,557
[SPEAKER_10]: I videotaped.

2012
02:30:02,017 --> 02:30:04,177
[SPEAKER_10]: And Nana told her story of coming to America.

2013
02:30:04,737 --> 02:30:08,738
[SPEAKER_10]: She had a little broken English, which was charming, and so that's why dad would help out his mother-in-law.

2014
02:30:09,979 --> 02:30:12,279
[SPEAKER_10]: And we have this one-hour video, and it's just beautiful.

2015
02:30:12,499 --> 02:30:15,600
[SPEAKER_10]: And I also did a cooking show with Nana up in Woburn.

2016
02:30:16,904 --> 02:30:25,507
[SPEAKER_10]: And the cooking show was lovely because she'd bake her pizzellas and that's what public access is all about.

2017
02:30:26,308 --> 02:30:34,611
[SPEAKER_10]: But all seven of you counselors, or six, and Mr. Caraviello, you all need public access TV.

2018
02:30:36,191 --> 02:30:41,173
[SPEAKER_10]: You all need it beyond cooking with grandma, the sports,

2019
02:30:42,992 --> 02:30:47,615
[SPEAKER_10]: the musicals at the Chevalier, and the wonderful things that Access can provide.

2020
02:30:47,655 --> 02:30:54,240
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, I spoke, I told Mayor McGlynn last week when I saw him, Your Honor, I can put this together in my sleep.

2021
02:30:55,221 --> 02:30:56,402
[SPEAKER_10]: And I saw Louise Miller.

2022
02:30:56,482 --> 02:30:57,663
[SPEAKER_10]: She's a wonderful woman.

2023
02:30:57,783 --> 02:31:00,605
[SPEAKER_10]: And I said to Louise, she's about 20 grand.

2024
02:31:00,625 --> 02:31:01,546
[SPEAKER_10]: We could have a little van.

2025
02:31:02,246 --> 02:31:04,148
[SPEAKER_10]: And here is my plan.

2026
02:31:04,748 --> 02:31:11,273
[SPEAKER_10]: We can have a van, a mobile van, to take political events and air them to Comcast Channel 3 and on Verizon.

2027
02:31:12,088 --> 02:31:15,711
[SPEAKER_10]: You can do it via cellular, so we do not need to have a station right now.

2028
02:31:16,151 --> 02:31:18,653
[SPEAKER_10]: The city can own the station temporarily.

2029
02:31:19,633 --> 02:31:27,058
[SPEAKER_10]: So the city can allow us to either put a temporary non-profit together or the city of Medford could authorize cable as other cities and towns have done.

2030
02:31:28,680 --> 02:31:34,904
[SPEAKER_10]: With a backpack, which costs approximately $7,000, we could go to the political events.

2031
02:31:35,584 --> 02:31:39,147
[SPEAKER_10]: And there have been so many new school committee members having political events.

2032
02:31:41,535 --> 02:31:42,355
[SPEAKER_10]: That should be taped.

2033
02:31:43,096 --> 02:31:44,476
[SPEAKER_10]: The woman from the Lions Club tonight.

2034
02:31:44,876 --> 02:31:47,157
[SPEAKER_10]: I know she would love to have her events taped.

2035
02:31:48,037 --> 02:31:50,838
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not happening in Medford, yet it happens in Somerville and everywhere.

2036
02:31:51,139 --> 02:32:00,682
[SPEAKER_10]: This is an emergency, and paying as much as we pay for each councilor, all seven of you should be really saying to the mayor, we know you're the issuing authority, but this is our issue.

2037
02:32:01,022 --> 02:32:02,363
[SPEAKER_10]: The constituents need this.

2038
02:32:03,823 --> 02:32:06,084
[SPEAKER_10]: The election season needs this.

2039
02:32:07,825 --> 02:32:08,585
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, the library,

2040
02:32:10,225 --> 02:32:17,127
[SPEAKER_10]: The library has a little bit of space, a temporary place at the library, and let's lend them some money.

2041
02:32:19,368 --> 02:32:23,830
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Council President, can I wait until the person's finished because the noise is kind of disrupting me?

2042
02:32:24,970 --> 02:32:26,491
[SPEAKER_10]: May I take a moment?

2043
02:32:29,031 --> 02:32:31,732
[SPEAKER_10]: May I take a moment because I'm being disturbed by one of the councilors.

2044
02:32:31,772 --> 02:32:32,453
[SPEAKER_10]: He's busy.

2045
02:32:36,220 --> 02:32:38,381
[SPEAKER_26]: The same topic's been discussed within the last 90 days.

2046
02:32:38,401 --> 02:32:40,202
[SPEAKER_26]: I'd like a ruling as to whether or not the paper's out of order.

2047
02:32:42,683 --> 02:32:44,184
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, this is a critical time.

2048
02:32:44,504 --> 02:32:45,365
[SPEAKER_10]: This is an election.

2049
02:32:45,785 --> 02:32:47,466
[SPEAKER_10]: And Paul Donato, State Rep.

2050
02:32:47,486 --> 02:32:47,946
[SPEAKER_10]: Paul Donato.

2051
02:32:47,966 --> 02:32:48,466
[SPEAKER_10]: He's not here right now.

2052
02:32:48,486 --> 02:32:53,949
[SPEAKER_10]: I saw him here with Susan Crowley on Friday night with Mari Carroll, and I'll quote the great Rep.

2053
02:32:53,969 --> 02:32:56,691
[SPEAKER_10]: Donato who said, it is the most protected right.

2054
02:32:56,711 --> 02:32:58,852
[SPEAKER_10]: So if he wants to strip away my First Amendment rights as

2055
02:32:59,743 --> 02:33:01,645
[SPEAKER_10]: as was done to Robert Cappucci earlier tonight.

2056
02:33:01,665 --> 02:33:07,849
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. President, I'm pretty sure that the Constitution of the United States of America does not say that you can come to a meeting and speak about whatever you want whenever you want.

2057
02:33:08,510 --> 02:33:12,153
[SPEAKER_26]: No one's impeding this gentleman from his freedom of speech.

2058
02:33:12,173 --> 02:33:14,695
[SPEAKER_10]: You can stand on the front stairs and scream all you want.

2059
02:33:15,495 --> 02:33:20,319
[SPEAKER_10]: If he's going to speak to the public, he should learn how to speak slowly and articulately.

2060
02:33:20,419 --> 02:33:23,461
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. President, I made a motion to have the ruling on the paper.

2061
02:33:23,501 --> 02:33:27,905
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm trying to get us access to TV, and this man voted for his own race and doesn't want to help the

2062
02:33:31,732 --> 02:33:41,834
[SPEAKER_21]: Sir, we're politely asking you to complete your remarks by staying on subject, and we're allowing you to continue.

2063
02:33:42,415 --> 02:33:43,035
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

2064
02:33:43,175 --> 02:33:45,215
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would appreciate no one interrupting me.

2065
02:33:46,556 --> 02:33:49,157
[SPEAKER_10]: The Chevalier is reportedly wired for Comcast.

2066
02:33:49,177 --> 02:33:50,297
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, they might have to upgrade it.

2067
02:33:50,917 --> 02:33:53,358
[SPEAKER_10]: So the Chevalier, the library, these are important.

2068
02:33:54,238 --> 02:33:57,639
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is a very important reason why I'm speaking here tonight.

2069
02:33:57,986 --> 02:34:09,692
[SPEAKER_10]: July 3rd is when the contract with Comcast expires, which means, if the mayor signs it, we get a balloon payment of about $350,000 and, I believe, another $38,000 from Verizon.

2070
02:34:10,073 --> 02:34:10,993
[SPEAKER_10]: This is significant.

2071
02:34:11,513 --> 02:34:18,717
[SPEAKER_10]: This is significant, President de la Ruzo, and I appreciate you letting me speak on this because I don't think the public knows this balloon payment's happening.

2072
02:34:19,018 --> 02:34:21,419
[SPEAKER_10]: We can lend money to the Chevalier for air conditioning.

2073
02:34:21,719 --> 02:34:26,522
[SPEAKER_10]: We can lend money to the library to help them out, and we can help this political season.

2074
02:34:27,436 --> 02:34:31,039
[SPEAKER_10]: candidate out there, you call me up and I will try to help you get on television.

2075
02:34:31,079 --> 02:34:32,560
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a camera, my own camera.

2076
02:34:33,661 --> 02:34:34,902
[SPEAKER_10]: I bought it right off of eBay.

2077
02:34:35,402 --> 02:34:36,122
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a camera.

2078
02:34:36,202 --> 02:34:41,807
[SPEAKER_10]: I can go anywhere and no access station can tell me I can't be political because it's my camera.

2079
02:34:42,247 --> 02:34:42,667
[SPEAKER_10]: Call me.

2080
02:34:42,947 --> 02:34:43,808
[SPEAKER_10]: I will help you out.

2081
02:34:44,429 --> 02:34:53,035
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, as we're all gearing up for reelection, can we get this question answered as to the status of the station?

2082
02:34:54,523 --> 02:35:00,227
[SPEAKER_21]: So on the motion of Councilor Camuso that the mayor report back to the city council on the status of the station.

2083
02:35:01,388 --> 02:35:02,148
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Penter.

2084
02:35:02,708 --> 02:35:15,637
[SPEAKER_29]: The question of June, July 3rd on the status of whether the mayor is going to sign a 10 year contract or not, unfortunately, um, I don't think should bode well with the rate payers here in this community.

2085
02:35:16,458 --> 02:35:21,001
[SPEAKER_29]: The mayor by design and choice did not pick a new director of public works.

2086
02:35:21,021 --> 02:35:23,082
[SPEAKER_29]: He's leaving that for the next mayor to come on board.

2087
02:35:23,835 --> 02:35:25,076
[SPEAKER_29]: in January of this year.

2088
02:35:26,396 --> 02:35:30,299
[SPEAKER_29]: That's just an 83,000, or strike that, it's about a $100,000 a year job.

2089
02:35:30,939 --> 02:35:34,301
[SPEAKER_29]: This is a 10-year, multi-year contract.

2090
02:35:34,341 --> 02:35:37,443
[SPEAKER_29]: This is a mega contract that this city will be signing with Comcast.

2091
02:35:38,103 --> 02:35:46,808
[SPEAKER_29]: And Comcast, as we all know, this probably has one of the worst reputations for public employment of their employees throughout the country.

2092
02:35:47,950 --> 02:35:48,930
[SPEAKER_29]: as they're being reviewed.

2093
02:35:48,970 --> 02:35:51,111
[SPEAKER_29]: And I think you can just find that out on their public service.

2094
02:35:51,591 --> 02:36:07,736
[SPEAKER_29]: But putting that aside and recognizing the fact that when the public hearing took place here regarding a public access cable in this community, I was the only one that represented, as an elected official, as any administrator, as the mayor, I was the only one that appeared here on behalf of the ratepayers.

2095
02:36:08,116 --> 02:36:10,357
[SPEAKER_29]: And city government should have been here on behalf of the ratepayers.

2096
02:36:10,917 --> 02:36:12,058
[SPEAKER_29]: They should have been on behalf here.

2097
02:36:12,518 --> 02:36:13,038
[SPEAKER_29]: And they weren't.

2098
02:36:13,658 --> 02:36:16,919
[SPEAKER_29]: And the sad part about this is whether you sign the 10-year contract or not,

2099
02:36:17,323 --> 02:36:26,530
[SPEAKER_29]: and you get that balloon payment, there's another $300,000 plus sitting downstairs as money that the mayor has held down here in escrow in the city's coffers.

2100
02:36:26,871 --> 02:36:28,212
[SPEAKER_29]: So this goes back to December of 2013.

2101
02:36:28,872 --> 02:36:32,015
[SPEAKER_29]: There's been no cable access here in the city of Medford.

2102
02:36:32,615 --> 02:36:33,556
[SPEAKER_29]: This is an election year.

2103
02:36:33,596 --> 02:36:39,701
[SPEAKER_29]: This will make two election cycles that the people have been denied an opportunity not only to see and hear their candidates.

2104
02:36:39,761 --> 02:36:41,382
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't care who you're for or who you're against.

2105
02:36:41,752 --> 02:36:45,173
[SPEAKER_29]: But that's what public access is about, plus any other community of interest.

2106
02:36:45,413 --> 02:36:47,914
[SPEAKER_29]: You have sports, you have arts, you have culture.

2107
02:36:48,174 --> 02:36:50,675
[SPEAKER_29]: There's a whole host of things that community access is all about.

2108
02:36:51,355 --> 02:36:57,077
[SPEAKER_29]: And this administration has intentionally denied that accessibility to take place here in this community.

2109
02:36:57,437 --> 02:36:58,077
[SPEAKER_29]: It is wrong.

2110
02:36:58,717 --> 02:37:07,040
[SPEAKER_29]: And I think what the gentleman at the podium was trying to say is, Mr. Mayor, you should just allow it, whether it's in a portable situation or make something temporary, whatever it might be.

2111
02:37:07,260 --> 02:37:10,761
[SPEAKER_29]: You know, we just went through a three-member committee who made a report.

2112
02:37:11,114 --> 02:37:17,256
[SPEAKER_29]: that came back and, you know, the mayor told him he wanted to come out in February, wanted to report by Memorial Day.

2113
02:37:17,496 --> 02:37:18,756
[SPEAKER_29]: Memorial Day has come and gone.

2114
02:37:19,016 --> 02:37:24,898
[SPEAKER_29]: We're almost into the July season here right now, and there is still nothing, whether you agree or disagree with the recommendations.

2115
02:37:25,318 --> 02:37:38,922
[SPEAKER_29]: And when the mayor wanted to put it up at the high school in the dead of night, where people would have to go there, where it would be dark and secluded, when the recommendation was to put it in an open downtown area, easily accessible to people, that's a shame.

2116
02:37:39,687 --> 02:37:55,903
[SPEAKER_29]: But I think it was Councilor Caviello and I think it was Mr. Viglione who mentioned the ideas of possibly going to Shavia, which is equipped to do it, or to put it in the second floor, or have a complete renovation with the friends of the Miffin Public Library and looking at its future use.

2117
02:37:55,983 --> 02:38:01,188
[SPEAKER_29]: And that's what the discussion was about on the money that went back to the library that the mayor mysteriously found.

2118
02:38:02,468 --> 02:38:03,569
[SPEAKER_29]: This is what it's all about.

2119
02:38:03,629 --> 02:38:05,070
[SPEAKER_29]: This is what community needs.

2120
02:38:05,370 --> 02:38:08,193
[SPEAKER_29]: They need not only this community access, they need this interaction.

2121
02:38:08,233 --> 02:38:09,654
[SPEAKER_29]: They need this transparency.

2122
02:38:10,034 --> 02:38:11,996
[SPEAKER_29]: They need to know that their money is being spent.

2123
02:38:12,436 --> 02:38:30,911
[SPEAKER_29]: Who in their right mind would believe that $300,000 of their cable money is sitting downstairs in this building, not getting any use, not even having any program, not even having any public input, not even coming and speaking in behalf of the ratepayers for which he is the issuing authority on.

2124
02:38:32,286 --> 02:38:34,107
[SPEAKER_11]: Point of information, Counselor Camuso.

2125
02:38:34,847 --> 02:38:45,233
[SPEAKER_11]: The city was represented by legal counsel at the hearing, who specifically, that's his job, representing the city in a contract with cable providers.

2126
02:38:45,913 --> 02:38:48,134
[SPEAKER_11]: So the city did have representation.

2127
02:38:48,694 --> 02:38:54,978
[SPEAKER_11]: And from my understanding, there wasn't many people that participated in it, unfortunately.

2128
02:38:55,798 --> 02:38:57,139
[SPEAKER_29]: Could you please repeat what you just said?

2129
02:38:57,279 --> 02:38:58,459
[SPEAKER_29]: Who was the city representative?

2130
02:38:59,020 --> 02:38:59,420
[SPEAKER_29]: The lawyer.

2131
02:39:00,105 --> 02:39:05,107
[SPEAKER_29]: The lawyer gets paid $330 an hour to be here, to listen, to hear the hearing.

2132
02:39:05,347 --> 02:39:06,627
[SPEAKER_29]: He wasn't representing the city.

2133
02:39:06,907 --> 02:39:10,548
[SPEAKER_29]: He was here to take the input of the people who were there at that meeting.

2134
02:39:11,108 --> 02:39:11,949
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what his input was.

2135
02:39:11,969 --> 02:39:13,009
[SPEAKER_11]: The counsel is incorrect.

2136
02:39:13,149 --> 02:39:21,812
[SPEAKER_11]: He was here representing the city to get the input, to see what the people of Medford, that are cable rate payers, would like to see included in a successor agreement.

2137
02:39:22,372 --> 02:39:24,733
[SPEAKER_31]: Point of information, Counselor Miles.

2138
02:39:24,833 --> 02:39:28,014
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm just wondering when this lawyer was elected by the people of this community.

2139
02:39:28,794 --> 02:39:29,034
[SPEAKER_31]: No, no.

2140
02:39:30,106 --> 02:39:37,008
[SPEAKER_31]: You said he was represent.

2141
02:39:37,588 --> 02:39:39,348
[SPEAKER_18]: Next time have a microphone on when you want.

2142
02:39:39,388 --> 02:39:44,850
[SPEAKER_29]: I believe the gentleman was employed by the mayor as he was 10 years ago when they had a public hearing here.

2143
02:39:45,610 --> 02:39:58,053
[SPEAKER_29]: And unbeknownst to anyone until the question was asked, the, the, um, the July 3rd date was as a result of two days ahead of time, the mayor having this conversation and asking for an extension to take place.

2144
02:39:58,922 --> 02:40:09,469
[SPEAKER_29]: When an ascertainment hearing took place at that meeting in May, and there was about 10 or 15 people here, but how do you have the hall filled with people when you have it at 2 o'clock in the afternoon and people are working?

2145
02:40:09,889 --> 02:40:10,610
[SPEAKER_29]: That's number one.

2146
02:40:10,990 --> 02:40:12,551
[SPEAKER_29]: When you have mostly senior citizens

2147
02:40:12,810 --> 02:40:29,624
[SPEAKER_29]: who came up here and dredged up here and to make the complaint about not only that, but having no senior citizen discount, not having an opportunity to have public access, not having an opportunity to have their money that's paid each and every month to go into a slush fund that's held downstairs, you might as well just give it back to the people.

2148
02:40:30,124 --> 02:40:39,953
[SPEAKER_29]: If they're not getting used of cable access and they're being charged for it, how do you take that money and account for it and tell the people you're getting public access when you're not getting it?

2149
02:40:40,893 --> 02:40:42,235
[SPEAKER_29]: That's not transparency.

2150
02:40:42,656 --> 02:40:44,579
[SPEAKER_29]: That's a shadow way of doing things.

2151
02:40:44,899 --> 02:40:46,301
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm going to keep it in secrecy.

2152
02:40:46,621 --> 02:40:47,803
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, what's the big secret here?

2153
02:40:48,424 --> 02:40:50,306
[SPEAKER_29]: Are we or are we not going to have public access?

2154
02:40:50,867 --> 02:40:51,769
[SPEAKER_29]: That's the bottom line.

2155
02:40:52,189 --> 02:40:55,654
[SPEAKER_29]: And the mayor has refused intentionally to answer that question.

2156
02:40:55,940 --> 02:40:58,101
[SPEAKER_29]: because he does not want public access on there.

2157
02:40:58,381 --> 02:41:01,362
[SPEAKER_29]: Whether it praises him or criticize him, he doesn't want it.

2158
02:41:01,802 --> 02:41:11,285
[SPEAKER_29]: The only thing he has is Channel 15 that he's used exclusively for himself, which is a high school educational channel that everyone else in this room is excluded from using.

2159
02:41:12,126 --> 02:41:12,766
[SPEAKER_29]: It's wrong.

2160
02:41:12,946 --> 02:41:13,346
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

2161
02:41:13,906 --> 02:41:14,847
[SPEAKER_21]: Counselor Camuso.

2162
02:41:15,127 --> 02:41:16,547
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I'm going to talk facts now.

2163
02:41:17,247 --> 02:41:19,608
[SPEAKER_11]: The facts are the city of Medford put out a bid.

2164
02:41:19,628 --> 02:41:24,710
[SPEAKER_11]: There was, I believe, one individual that put in a bid

2165
02:41:25,157 --> 02:41:28,898
[SPEAKER_11]: that currently doesn't have a corporation or a company.

2166
02:41:30,419 --> 02:41:32,139
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's, I'm assuming, still under review.

2167
02:41:32,539 --> 02:41:37,421
[SPEAKER_11]: The second piece of it is, we are getting a studio and it's going to be up at Medford High School.

2168
02:41:38,521 --> 02:41:39,341
[SPEAKER_11]: Up at Medford High School.

2169
02:41:39,361 --> 02:41:39,681
[SPEAKER_11]: Representative.

2170
02:41:40,942 --> 02:41:41,442
[SPEAKER_29]: Point of information.

2171
02:41:41,482 --> 02:41:43,222
[SPEAKER_29]: Point of information, Councilor Panta.

2172
02:41:43,242 --> 02:41:45,683
[SPEAKER_29]: Show us the document where that information is coming from.

2173
02:41:45,723 --> 02:41:50,124
[SPEAKER_29]: Because none of us in this room have a document that says a studio is going up there.

2174
02:41:50,504 --> 02:41:52,945
[SPEAKER_29]: And how is it going to be funded and when is it going to begin?

2175
02:41:53,439 --> 02:42:10,603
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, if I may continue talking facts, if I may continue talking facts, they did make an announcement with the director of the vocational school, Representative Donato, I believe Ann Marie Cunha was at the event, as well as Mayor McGlynn.

2176
02:42:10,623 --> 02:42:12,703
[SPEAKER_11]: Subsequent to that,

2177
02:42:16,423 --> 02:42:20,104
[SPEAKER_29]: picture that took place up there, that whole situation is now on hold.

2178
02:42:20,124 --> 02:42:26,826
[SPEAKER_29]: There's absolutely nothing going on at the vocational school or the high school where it's going to put that studio up there.

2179
02:42:26,846 --> 02:42:30,608
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, they are working on the area.

2180
02:42:30,648 --> 02:42:32,768
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually visited the area where they're putting it.

2181
02:42:33,148 --> 02:42:40,731
[SPEAKER_11]: And my question is, if we're going to have people go into that building, I want to make sure that they're corey cleared and taking precautions to protect our children.

2182
02:42:41,151 --> 02:42:43,892
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're actually putting out they're putting out

2183
02:42:45,821 --> 02:42:51,205
[SPEAKER_11]: They may possibly put a door leading directly into the studio so that they don't have to traverse the high school.

2184
02:42:51,726 --> 02:42:54,628
[SPEAKER_11]: So like I said, I just wanted to bring a couple facts to the table.

2185
02:42:55,068 --> 02:42:58,911
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's always good to ask the question, as I stated a little earlier.

2186
02:42:59,251 --> 02:43:04,876
[SPEAKER_11]: But also if we can get an update from Louise Miller on the one person that did put in for the bid.

2187
02:43:05,696 --> 02:43:06,937
[SPEAKER_11]: It's some entity.

2188
02:43:08,260 --> 02:43:12,443
[SPEAKER_11]: But I don't know much about the person or entity, so if we could get a report back on that.

2189
02:43:12,463 --> 02:43:12,863
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

2190
02:43:12,923 --> 02:43:16,545
[SPEAKER_21]: So on the motion of Councilor Camuso, as amended by Councilor Camuso.

2191
02:43:18,267 --> 02:43:21,449
[SPEAKER_10]: Just one point of clarification, City Council President.

2192
02:43:21,489 --> 02:43:22,189
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much.

2193
02:43:22,910 --> 02:43:24,951
[SPEAKER_10]: The facts are incorrect for Mr. Camuso.

2194
02:43:24,971 --> 02:43:32,736
[SPEAKER_10]: There is a business registered with the City of Medford called Community Media Medford, and it will become a corporation the minute the mayor gives the green light.

2195
02:43:32,756 --> 02:43:35,358
[SPEAKER_10]: And I have the money to make it a corporation instantly.

2196
02:43:35,558 --> 02:43:35,858
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

2197
02:43:36,967 --> 02:43:38,507
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2198
02:43:39,048 --> 02:43:41,448
[SPEAKER_11]: If I may, are you the person that put in the bid?

2199
02:43:41,468 --> 02:43:43,088
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

2200
02:43:43,449 --> 02:43:44,169
[SPEAKER_11]: This is news to me.

2201
02:43:45,049 --> 02:43:46,789
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll get a clarification from the mayor.

2202
02:43:46,809 --> 02:43:49,290
[SPEAKER_18]: So on the motion of council, Camuso for approval.

2203
02:43:49,330 --> 02:43:50,210
[SPEAKER_18]: All those in favor.

2204
02:43:50,850 --> 02:43:53,451
[SPEAKER_18]: Did you know he put in for the bid?

2205
02:43:56,152 --> 02:43:57,552
[SPEAKER_01]: Me neither.

2206
02:43:59,352 --> 02:44:03,833
[SPEAKER_01]: If this thing is going to take off, it needs community input.

2207
02:44:04,494 --> 02:44:06,334
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs a lot of community input.

2208
02:44:06,923 --> 02:44:11,085
[SPEAKER_01]: and the people need to come together because it is a resource.

2209
02:44:11,225 --> 02:44:12,206
[SPEAKER_01]: Forget all the politics.

2210
02:44:13,367 --> 02:44:14,407
[SPEAKER_01]: You can pressure the mayor.

2211
02:44:14,807 --> 02:44:19,970
[SPEAKER_01]: The people, not you folks, the people can put pressure on the mayor.

2212
02:44:20,871 --> 02:44:30,796
[SPEAKER_01]: Only if they band together, whether it be the arts community, the business community, a combination like I talked about, Cross Nova, and everybody getting together.

2213
02:44:31,397 --> 02:44:33,017
[SPEAKER_01]: They need a good, strong 15 to 20 bodies.

2214
02:44:34,724 --> 02:44:38,707
[SPEAKER_01]: with a lot of knowledge about nonprofits, a lot of knowledge about media, a lot of knowledge.

2215
02:44:38,727 --> 02:44:40,067
[SPEAKER_01]: It can't be just one person.

2216
02:44:40,708 --> 02:44:45,471
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs to be a body of people, about 15 to 20, very dedicated community people.

2217
02:44:45,551 --> 02:44:48,273
[SPEAKER_01]: And 15 to 20 people could change this whole conversation.

2218
02:44:49,113 --> 02:44:55,878
[SPEAKER_01]: If you got those people to show up at the mayor's office and said, we're ready, we want this to happen, it would happen.

2219
02:44:55,938 --> 02:44:58,840
[SPEAKER_01]: He wouldn't have a choice if you had 15 people.

2220
02:44:58,920 --> 02:44:59,240
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

2221
02:45:01,642 --> 02:45:02,002
[SPEAKER_21]: Good evening.

2222
02:45:02,082 --> 02:45:03,603
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

2223
02:45:04,555 --> 02:45:05,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Mario Martin at 198 Harvard.

2224
02:45:07,076 --> 02:45:18,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Really briefly, I just want to say that the fact that we're here assembling and using the democratic process to ask the administration to discontinue defunding local access is, in my opinion, personally, pretty ridiculous.

2225
02:45:20,219 --> 02:45:24,400
[SPEAKER_03]: As a constitutional watchdog that I am, this is unconstitutional.

2226
02:45:25,900 --> 02:45:32,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Essentially, what's happening is my right to freedom of speech is basically being taken away.

2227
02:45:35,233 --> 02:45:36,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone knows I'm running for public office.

2228
02:45:38,514 --> 02:45:48,659
[SPEAKER_03]: I need the ability to exercise my freedom to speak to my neighbors so I can get the message out to everybody.

2229
02:45:50,680 --> 02:45:53,461
[SPEAKER_03]: But let's just use logic for a second.

2230
02:45:53,481 --> 02:46:01,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just say the media blackout isn't about the administration trying to handicap thoroughly good Medford citizens.

2231
02:46:01,724 --> 02:46:03,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Why else are we here?

2232
02:46:05,990 --> 02:46:06,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Why are we here?

2233
02:46:06,691 --> 02:46:08,732
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is this even an issue?

2234
02:46:11,795 --> 02:46:21,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Funding local access puts the word unity in community, and I'm in strong support of the immediate restoration of public access.

2235
02:46:22,604 --> 02:46:22,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

2236
02:46:26,467 --> 02:46:29,209
[SPEAKER_21]: So on the motion of Councilor Camuso for approval, all those in favor?

2237
02:46:32,432 --> 02:46:33,192
[SPEAKER_21]: All those opposed?

2238
02:46:33,212 --> 02:46:34,133
[SPEAKER_21]: The motion passes.

2239
02:46:36,299 --> 02:46:42,942
[SPEAKER_21]: 15556, communication from the mayor are revised on the motion of Councilor Camuso to table.

2240
02:46:42,962 --> 02:46:43,823
[SPEAKER_21]: All those in favor?

2241
02:46:43,863 --> 02:46:44,683
[SPEAKER_21]: All those opposed?

2242
02:46:45,283 --> 02:46:46,404
[SPEAKER_21]: Paper is tabled.

2243
02:46:46,804 --> 02:46:53,407
[SPEAKER_21]: The records of the last meeting of the Memphis City Council were passed to Council on night, June 16, 2015.

2244
02:46:53,808 --> 02:46:56,249
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor, your recommendation, please.

2245
02:46:56,269 --> 02:47:04,413
[SPEAKER_26]: It's with great happiness that I would recommend that the minutes of last week's meeting be approved, Mr. President.

2246
02:47:06,466 --> 02:47:08,371
[SPEAKER_21]: and then on your motion for adjournment.

2247
02:47:08,732 --> 02:47:10,316
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll give you the motion for adjournment.

2248
02:47:11,238 --> 02:47:12,120
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, councillors.
