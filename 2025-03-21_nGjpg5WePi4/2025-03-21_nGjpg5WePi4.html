    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=827.493s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=828.454s">Mr.</a>  President, I don't know if people have noticed, but over the weekend, a third massage parlor has opened up right in the heart of Method Square, which is right next to the pawn shop that's already have people in the square unhappy with. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=847.568s">Mr.</a>  President, we have one operating on Central Avenue, <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=853.42s">which</a>  is right beside a residential home in a park where children play. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=858.942s">We</a>  have another one operating on Main Street, which is in a residential neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=863.004s">And</a>  then now we have this one, which is right in the center of our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=867.026s">It's</a>  a square that we're trying to rebuild and do over, and this is what's coming into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=872.528s">Mr.</a>  President, also, I mean, these three establishments, they advertise on a daily basis, and the adult sections, the back page, <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=882.797s">and</a>  Craigslist. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=884.818s">So</a>  they're obviously not doing the normal therapeutic massage services. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=892.721s">They're</a>  doing things that we know that they shouldn't be doing there. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=895.582s">And</a>  they were here a couple of years ago, and the chief pretty much rid the community of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=901.605s">But</a>  now they seem to be coming back in. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=904.726s">You</a>  let one, two, and they're all back. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=907.487s">I</a>  mean, this is not a problem that's immune to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=911.822s">It</a>  happens in a lot of other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=913.463s">They</a>  come in, they operate for two or three months, and then they're gone again once the enforcement officers start getting them. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=921.125s">But,</a>  you know, if you look at the one just that's in the square, it's obviously in violation of some of our codes. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=926.786s">And</a>  I'd like to have a response from all the departments for next week's meeting so we can discuss this again. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=935.329s">And</a>  I know there'll be more members of the community that would like to discuss this. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=939.297s">So</a>  if we could send that along to the proper departments, Mr. President, it would be greatly appreciated.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=945.198s">Very</a>  good, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=946.218s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Caraviello to refer the paper to the department heads, Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=952.94s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much, and thank you, Councilor Caraviello, for putting this matter forward this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=958.381s">I,</a>  too, got an email on this same topic, and I did some research, and it seems to me that <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=966.528s">Massage</a>  therapy parlors are not under the scope and purview of the local authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=970.231s">They</a>  fall under that of the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=972.113s">So</a>  the department of professional licensure has a licensing branch that would be responsible for the oversight of massage parlors. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=980.64s">And</a>  it's my understanding based upon conversations that I've had with the code enforcement officer that they have reported this facility into the state for investigation and assurance with compliance, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=996.458s">I</a>  just wanted the council to be aware that it's outside of local control and the local authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1001.821s">It</a>  really lies within the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1003.623s">And</a>  it's my understanding also that the proposed use of the location in Medford Square is a personal services use. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1013.729s">It</a>  was a former barber shop, and now it's a massage parlor, which falls in the same use. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1017.832s">So</a>  it's a conforming use. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1019.913s">So</a>  that's one of the reasons why the business was able to open there. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1023.655s">It's</a>  a conforming use. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1024.476s">No</a>  special permit was necessary or needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1026.794s">But</a>  with that being said, I think that the appropriate place to send the question would be to the State's Division of Professional Licensure as opposed to local authorities because they don't have any oversight.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1037.523s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1037.963s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1038.724s">Councilor</a>  Penta.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1041.286s">Including</a>  or concurring with the remarks of Councilor Knight, I think what we need is a report back from our city solicitor that basically addresses the fact that it's a concern here within our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1054.637s">And</a>  since it's an allowable or <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1056.659s">appearing</a>  to be an allowable use according to our zoning, I think what needs to be addressed is maybe addressing the licensure division back in Boston and indicating to them that something like this should come under the authority of the local legislative body rather than a state agency because the effect of the granting of this particular license does affect the community, whether it's abutting a residential, commercial, or what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1080.786s">And</a>  with that being said, I would ask that <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1083.975s">if</a>  this is what the case needs to be, that our city solicitor provide to us the legalese in writing to support either a recommendation, I don't know, I think it would be a home rule petition, it might be just a waiver of rules and regulations that the Division of Licensure might have at the present time to support local communities, whether they want it or they won't want it, because unfortunately there is no public hearing, there is no public commentary on this, <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1112.417s">Councilor</a>  Knight just alluded to, they could go anywhere they want because the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is allowing this to their license or division. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1118.339s">So</a>  I'm going to move that as an amendment to the resolution to find out just where we can go with this.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1123.821s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Caraviello, as amended by Councilor Penta, Councilor Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1129.662s">Mr.</a>  President, Councilor Knight is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1131.243s">You</a>  know, there's this minimal that the city can do because, you know, they don't have to have a license, but they are in violation at the moment of the sign ordinance because 100% of their window <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1142.103s">It's</a>  taken up. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1143.644s">It's</a>  blocked from view. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1145.424s">And</a>  again, if the police are in there and putting pressure on them, it keeps their customers away. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1154.728s">And</a>  once their customers go away, they go away. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1157.349s">Because</a>  you've noticed other communities, they've been here before. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1160.291s">They</a>  come for two or three months, and then they'll be gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1162.912s">So</a>  I think if the police put a little pressure on them and the other authorities put a little pressure on them, <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1171.358s">they'll</a>  see that we mean business in this community, and we're not going to stand for that type of business here. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1175.921s">Like</a>  I say, because if you see where they're advertising, they're not advertising things that I want in my community.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1189.07s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1190.451s">And</a>  I think if the councilors remember, we did receive an opinion that sent the matter to the DPL from the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1200.771s">some</a>  years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1202.412s">Constable</a>  Alongo-Kern.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1203.872s">Thank</a>  you, President Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1206.933s">I,</a>  too, received the emails. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1208.254s">I</a>  actually shot off one of the complaints to the chief of police because this is such a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1215.136s">We</a>  were well aware it was state regulated. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1217.877s">We</a>  had a committee of the whole meetings on this two years ago when it was a real issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1222.56s">But</a>  I believe that our city, I think Councilor Dello Russo and Councilor Caraviello is correct by having our officials involved in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1230.083s">Not</a>  only can they put pressure on the state, but it was the police in the community of Medford that completely eliminated one of the shops. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1237.787s">I</a>  believe they were investigating for months and months a number of the pilers, and we did create an end to the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1245.891s">Now,</a>  all of a sudden, they're back, so I just think <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1248.908s">we</a>  need to not only ask our city officials to do what they can do and put pressure on the state, and then also figure out if there's a way we can, we had a meeting on it already, it didn't seem like Karen Rose was able to get that done with regards to requiring the permits to come through the city of Medford, but obviously if she can maybe look into that again, I think that would give us the extra oomph we need to really work on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1273.842s">It's</a>  a disgrace when our residents are emailing us <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1276.617s">and</a>  asking questions and just appalled at, you know, what's going on and what's being advertised in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1282.861s">We</a>  have children and teenagers who frequent the square, you know, especially during the summer months. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1288.405s">And</a>  that's just something I don't, I wouldn't want my children walking by and being witnessed to. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1293.708s">So</a>  I think every council is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1296.93s">And</a>  I think we just need to put pressure on, you know, everybody we can to make sure this is investigated and give the police the tools to make sure that we can do what we can to <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1306.776s">rid</a>  them of our community, from our community.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1311.278s">Thank</a>  you, Madam Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1312.498s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1313.558s">Mr.</a>  President, yes, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1315.899s">I</a>  believe it was Chapter 135 of the Acts of 2006 that was passed that created this board that would govern massage therapy parlors. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1324.922s">And</a>  the principal function of that piece of legislation was to actually take local control away from local boards of health so that they could be consistent and across the board policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1336.399s">from</a>  community to community, city to city, town to town. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1339.42s">I</a>  think that it's a bad piece of legislation. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1341.841s">It</a>  was a bad bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1343.202s">You</a>  know, we can't take away the control of our local Board of Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1345.923s">They're</a>  doing an exceptional job in ensuring our safety and our protection and well-being. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1351.605s">And</a>  I think that's one of the primary flaws. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1353.166s">It's</a>  actually with the legislation that was passed, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1355.967s">And</a>  I think that going forward, this council might want to sit down and meet with our delegation to see maybe if there's something we can do to change that.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1365.143s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Caraviello, as amended by Councilor Penta, Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1373.448s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1374.448s">I</a>  want to thank my Councilor colleague for putting this on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1378.13s">This</a>  is a very important issue, but I think the larger issue here that we have to look at, it's great to have the Chief of Police go down and <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1386.518s">do</a>  what he can do or the building commissioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1388.88s">But</a>  we also have to look at new investment, attracting new businesses into our business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1396.167s">And</a>  we've failed as a community for the past 25 years in revitalizing our business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1403.473s">And</a>  what we're seeing right now is you're seeing best sellers. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1407.417s">You're</a>  seeing Forest Street, the art place that was on Forest Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1412.205s">You're</a>  seeing Ward's gifts. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1413.926s">You're</a>  seeing a number of decent, long-established businesses in this community moving out, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1420.251s">And</a>  what we're getting in is pawn shops, massage parlors, because there's no clear direction in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1428.084s">This</a>  administration, this Office of Community Development, has done nothing to improve the business districts, not just in Medford Square, but all five business districts throughout our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1438.63s">And</a>  now we're seeing the repercussions of a lax government that doesn't care what moves in. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1445.433s">You</a>  know why they're coming in? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1446.634s">Look</a>  at the open spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1448.415s">Go</a>  around the square, look at the open fronts. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1450.916s">Go</a>  to Davis Square, see if you can get a front. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1454.365s">a</a>  storefront for cheap money in Davis Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1456.447s">It's</a>  on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1457.367s">It</a>  can't be had. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1458.949s">It</a>  can't be had. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1460.17s">You</a>  know why? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1461.05s">Because</a>  they've revitalized their business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1463.832s">They're</a>  attracting businesses that are growing. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1466.595s">They're</a>  creating a neighborhood of businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1469.457s">And</a>  that currently does not exist within our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1473.2s">And</a>  now we're seeing the results, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1477.383s">And,</a>  you know, I support having the police go down there and the closing up and so forth and the investigations and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1484.308s">But</a>  let's look at the root cause. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1487.149s">Nothing</a>  has been done by this Office of Community Development in the past five years to attract new investments into our business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1495.133s">Nothing</a>  at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1496.474s">And</a>  we've spoke about it time and time again. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1498.715s">You</a>  know, it's not the field of dreams. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1501.257s">If</a>  you build it, they'll come. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1502.817s">We</a>  haven't built anything in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1505.899s">We</a>  have an area where pedestrians can't walk in a safe manner around our business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1511.622s">They're</a>  afraid to cross High Street and Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1514.937s">You</a>  have poor lighting in the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1517.499s">You</a>  have filthy, dirty streets, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1520.261s">If</a>  you go down there any time, you'll see the trash strewn throughout the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1525.464s">You</a>  know, it just, in my opinion, is a true lack of leadership. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1530.268s">And,</a>  you know, it's unfortunate, but now we're seeing what takes place. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1534.29s">These</a>  seedy establishments find the areas they can infiltrate, and that's what's happening now. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1540.995s">Let's</a>  look at an area that's not well lit. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1544.514s">Aha,</a>  Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1546.736s">Perfect.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1551.058s">Let's</a>  take a look at this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1553.5s">And</a>  let's just not react, because we're going to get establishments like this come in and out of our community. <a

these type of establishments to move in, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1568.31s">Let's</a>  have a communication with the landlords, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1571.912s">Let's</a>  have a game plan here. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1573.51s">We</a>  have no game plan in this community, and it's unfortunate. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1577.352s">And</a>  I hope not only this massage parlor, but also the pawn shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1582.296s">And</a>  I wish all businesses well, but I've walked by that pawn shop a million times. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1587.519s">I've</a>  never seen anyone in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1589.16s">And</a>  I see a shelf that has a chainsaw. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1593.162s">I</a>  don't know the last time anyone behind this railings looked for a chainsaw, but it's possible people are looking for them out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1600.067s">But</a>  I don't see what type of business they're doing in there, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1604.078s">And</a>  it's unfortunate you as a business owner should be out there fighting for businesses and not just to reap the benefits where you are currently on Main Street, but to have your success citywide, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1616.583s">And</a>  so I would ask that this paper be forwarded to the Office of Community Development to see what their long-range plan is. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1624.126s">I</a>  mean, it's already been 25 years, so maybe they have a 50-year plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1630.23s">I'm</a>  not sure, but I think we should be asking what the long-range plan is in this community to attract new businesses and to make our business district something we can be proud of, something that after seven o'clock they don't roll the sidewalks up and it's dark with no personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1646.358s">That</a>  may work in your business, Mr. President, you know, but it's not working across the city and we need to invite new business, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1660.198s">I'm</a>  glad Councilman Marks brought this up because the interesting component about this is when we had a conversation about this a few months back, I introduced the offering as what they did and I don't have my notes with me right now, so I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1672.5s">But</a>  in Florida, they had a particular community where their downtown areas were exactly as Councilman Marks was alluding to. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1679.281s">And</a>  what they did is they made offerings to the owners of the property either with tax incentives or employment incentives or community-based incentives. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1688.415s">which</a>  would have allowed the owner of the property, whoever he rented out to, to get one of these benefits for the purposes of coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1697.099s">And</a>  what they did is they sort of like took a particular street, and what they just did, from A to B to C to D. Now about three weeks ago, I went and I heard the lady who works for the community of Lowell, and she is not the community office director, but she is the director, I believe, <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1716.107s">cultural</a>  resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1717.448s">And</a>  what they did is they took street by street. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1720.771s">And</a>  what they did, as Councilor Marks alluded to, they've alluded, they went from one street to the next street and just jumped. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1726.415s">And</a>  they just piggybacked all the way around to an entire portion of the town. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1730.698s">Where</a>  now, it doesn't happen overnight, but you need to have a beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1733.881s">And</a>  that's what the beginning is. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1735.502s">It's</a>  unfortunate that this administration does not realize that, didn't take advantage of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1740.306s">We've</a>  talked about revitalizing Medford Square three times in the <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1743.495s">past</a>  20 years, and it hasn't happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1746.596s">But</a>  what needs to happen is the business people. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1748.936s">And</a>  this is a true test now for the Chamber of Commerce to come to life and say, hey, you know, we want good businesses to be here in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1755.458s">We</a>  want to be a working partner here with the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1758.339s">And</a>  if this is the issue tonight, and it really brings it to head, then so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1762.96s">And</a>  I think you're right, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1766.261s">I</a>  just think this is the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1768.142s">The</a>  people really need to know, you know, what their government is doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1770.982s">You</a>  know, what is the forecast? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1772.203s">What</a>  is the plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1773.293s">you</a>  know, what's the open window and the fresh air going to be all about as it relates to where we're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1778.117s">So</a>  I support, I support your thoughts and I can assure you that that would be in my plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1783.361s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1784.682s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1785.062s">Councilor.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1785.503s">Councilor.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1786.724s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1787.284s">One</a>  more thing, you know, councilor marks mentioned about rolling the sidewalks up at seven o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1793.049s">I</a>  don't know if anyone's been to that part of the street, but the streets are already rolled up in that part of the square because of the constant bus traffic is, <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1803.861s">There's</a>  a rolling street there that people are tripping over and cars have a hard time maneuvering. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1812.208s">And</a>  that's also because there's no care for that part of the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1819.034s">So</a>  again, that will be something else I'd like to have looked into, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1824.759s">On</a>  the motion, ma'am, please state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1956.961s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1957.862s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Caraviello, as amended, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1961.863s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1963.243s">Motion</a>  carries. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1964.964s">Councilor</a>  Penta?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=1993.675s">If</a>  anybody were to go to Medford Square and just look at the 5 High Street building that's there now, they've had scaffolding and staging there for well over in excess of three months. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2003.64s">It's</a>  an absolute disgrace. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2005.041s">It's</a>  an eyesore. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2006.222s">It's</a>  a public health and it's a public safety issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2009.265s">This</a>  is what I don't understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2011.426s">How</a>  long does it take for something like that to stay there before it causes a real harm and a real problem to the people within this community? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2020.053s">The</a>  owner of the property should be held accountable. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2022.695s">It's</a>  been like that for three months. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2024.517s">There's</a>  no work. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2025.257s">There</a>  has been no work that's been done other than putting up the scaffolding. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2029.057s">And</a>  nobody knows what the reason is. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2030.938s">It</a>  surrounds the entire building. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2032.798s">If</a>  surrounding the entire building and the parapet has a problem, well, there's no work that's been done on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2039.061s">I</a>  just think it's unfair to every other business person that does what they're supposed to do in the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2043.783s">We</a>  just had a conversation out tonight of putting a massage parlor on Riverside Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2047.864s">And</a>  that's as bad as looking at a parapet because, again, it serves no particular purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2052.606s">It</a>  offers no intrinsic value to the community of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2056.147s">It</a>  absolutely is an eyesight. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2058.364s">And,</a>  as I said, it's a public safety, health, and a building department issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2063.785s">I've</a>  seen people walk underneath that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2065.405s">I</a>  saw it today — yesterday, when I was walking, a lady with a baby carriage. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2069.006s">And</a>  she had to move her baby carriage out from under because, unfortunately, the other lady who was walking down was in a walker. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2075.347s">And,</a>  you know, so that was nice of her to do that, but there should have been no reason for her to do that because she had to go out underneath it and then bring herself back in. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2083.348s">So</a>  I'm asking, Mr. President, that our building department find out who that owner is immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2088.207s">and</a>  find out what the reason is. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2089.607s">And</a>  if no work is being done there, then take that scaffolding down because it's serving absolutely no purpose at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2096.609s">And</a>  it's just absolutely making Medford Square look exactly what people are saying it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2101.529s">It's</a>  a no man's land town. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2103.31s">It</a>  offers nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2104.39s">It</a>  shows you nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2106.15s">And</a>  I don't want that to be an example of what we're offering in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2112.852s">Roll</a>  call vote and have that vote to the building commissioner.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2367.198s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2369.199s">I</a>  have comments with regards to the actual budget, but I think one of the main issues is that we do not have all the answers to our questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2378.303s">I</a>  know there are <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2379.898s">There</a>  was five department heads that were not able to answer the questions we had asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2386.481s">We've</a>  had multiple, multiple Committee of the Whole meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2389.442s">We've</a>  gone hours discussing and asking questions and trying to dissect and figure out answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2396.065s">Most</a>  department heads have been great. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2398.066s">School</a>  department, which we met with last night at 5.30 to about 8 p.m., did come in and give us <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2403.982s">and</a>  all our answers, but we didn't actually get those until tonight at 5.30. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2409.426s">So</a>  as of right now, we have our school budget book, we have our budget book, and we got this tonight to review. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2417.812s">I</a>  know most Councilors were trying to read, trying to ask questions, trying to get a grip on what we have, you know, the job that we have at hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2428.059s">I</a>  myself was able to read through probably <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2432.004s">a</a>  tenth, maybe an eighth of what was given to me tonight, I don't feel comfortable going forward without reading the rest. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2442.547s">I</a>  mean, I didn't even look at the audits that were provided to us, which I thank Louise for, and a number of others. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2450.23s">I</a>  don't even know what some of these documents are, so I would like one more week to review it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2455.211s">I</a>  know that pushes us into the last Tuesday of the month, but I think that's only fair to <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2461.867s">the</a>  job that we have at hand and the job we have to do for the taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2468.031s">I</a>  know, like I said, now we have four departments that haven't answered our questions, and there are questions that need to be answered with regards to income, revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2478.498s">We</a>  have the treasure collector wasn't able to get to us yet, get our answers yet, and that's important information, and this is the only way we can hold those questions <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2491.431s">hold</a>  those department heads to the fire to actually answer the questions in a timely manner, which, you know, it's been great so far, but there's just a job that we need to continue to do, and I need to spend a few more hours on this myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2505.982s">So</a>  I would move to table.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2509.024s">Is</a>  a motion for approval on the floor? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2511.306s">Motion</a>  to table is undebatable. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2514.889s">On</a>  the motion of Vice President Lungo-Koehn to table, roll call has been requested by Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2522.217s">Mr.</a>  Kerlark, please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2530.701s">To</a>  table.</p>

<a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2669.69s">Not</a>  including the current budget director, because she was kind of presented this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2675.033s">What</a>  message does that send to these department heads and to the administration? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2679.656s">We'll</a>  meet with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2681.097s">We'll</a>  let them ask questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2682.718s">But</a>  guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2684.439s">They're</a>  going to vote on the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2686.501s">They're</a>  going to vote on the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2687.681s">Don't</a>  worry about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2689.322s">For</a>  instance, Mr. President, when Council on Aging was present in the room, and many members behind this reeling thanked the director for the job she's doing, and some of us asked the director, what could you use in your program across the street in the senior center? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2710.269s">And</a>  it was mentioned, it was my resolution, asking about programming, and the director stated that <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2716.501s">The</a>  only programming money that she gets to run the many, many events that our seniors take advantage of across the street, the ones around election time that we all attend to make sure we're there. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2730.209s">We</a>  asked, what can we do? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2732.17s">And</a>  the program director said, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2733.991s">Programming</a>  is always at the top of the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2737.473s">The</a>  seniors love it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2739.122s">maybe</a>  some more outreach, and we offered a resolve to the budget to allocate $5,000, earmarked $5,000, to senior programming in the senior center. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2753.391s">And</a>  it was supported wholeheartedly by the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2756.713s">The</a>  response we got back from the administration, surprise, surprise, we'll take it under advisement. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2764.412s">Now,</a>  the mayor, when he received 300 emails regarding the library not receiving its accreditation, somehow found $250,000 like it fell out of the sky. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2776.656s">He</a>  said that there was a project being done in the community and we're going to reap the revenue from the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2781.378s">But</a>  he was able to locate a quarter of a million dollars, Mr. President, through that asset. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2786.419s">But,</a>  you know, this to me was a small request. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2790.201s">It</a>  was something to recognize the seniors in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2794.252s">And</a>  it was to let the administration know, like we did last year with the library bathroom, we allocated $10,000 to the library bathroom so they could do some repairs to the deplorable condition of the bathrooms in the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2810.677s">A</a>  few years back, we had a separate line item put in for the Method Arts Council, a first ever in this city's history to create a line item budget to support the arts. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2821.5s">And</a>  now we're asking <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2822.803s">What</a>  can we do for our seniors to add some programming in the senior center? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2826.746s">So</a>  that's one issue, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2828.687s">A</a>  vote here tonight for this budget flies in the face, Mr. President, of everything we said in that room a couple of weeks ago or a week ago about supporting programming for the seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2841.837s">Now,</a>  all of a sudden, you know, I heard members say, I'm not going to hold up a budget for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2846.82s">Well,</a>  I didn't hear that the other night when the director was in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2850.023s">But</a>  now we're not going to hold up a program for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2853.518s">I'm</a>  willing to hold up a program for that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2856.001s">And</a>  I'm willing to hold up a budget, like I've done in the past, based on my beliefs, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2863.126s">A</a>  couple of other issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2865.168s">This</a>  was brought up, I believe, Council Vice President Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2869.432s">We</a>  asked if we can get a report back on the condition of all the repairs that were done in the firehouses. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2878.579s">We</a>  all know that we bonded several million dollars to repair. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2882.341s">firehouses</a>  throughout our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2884.262s">We</a>  wanted an update from the OPM manager, Mr. Buckley, regarding the condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2891.666s">We're</a>  getting phone calls and e-mails from firefighters saying that the work that was just done, tile floors are already coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2899.191s">I</a>  don't know about you, Mr. President, if I just paid thousands of dollars to do a tile floor in my kitchen, I wouldn't be shrugging that off saying, ah, it's not a big deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2908.236s">I'd</a>  be concerned, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2910.297s">And</a>  I think we all should be concerned behind this reeling that we get an answer on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2914.259s">So,</a>  that's another one that we're waiting for an answer on. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2916.98s">Point</a>  of information, Madam Vice President.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2921.162s">Thank</a>  you, Council President De La Ruzo. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2923.563s">Sorry</a>  to interrupt you, Councilor Marks, but I just think that one is so important because if we do not, you know, really push for that answer, we're going to lose our time frame with regards to the warranty that is given to the city <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2939.412s">of</a>  one year on the $2 million that the taxpayers paid to improve those fire stations. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2945.674s">Right</a>  now, not all the work was done correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2950.156s">We</a>  have an OPM who I believe is retiring. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2953.017s">Who</a>  is going to oversee that? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2954.377s">And</a>  we only have until December. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2956.758s">That</a>  on top of the fact that we have the DPW yard, which we spent almost over $14 million on, and we have a one-year warranty on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2965.921s">So</a>  we have questions with regards to who's going to <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2968.272s">oversee</a>  and make sure that that work was done correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2971.054s">If</a>  we lose that opportunity, if we wait until that warranty is done and over, what are we going to ask the taxpayer two, three years from now for more money to fix the repairs that could have been covered by warranty? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2984.423s">We</a>  don't have those answers, and that's one of the ones that has stuck out for me within the last three weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2991.088s">I</a>  feel like it's $16-plus million on the taxpayer's behalf that we need to fight for answers for. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2997.881s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3000.442s">Thank</a>  you, Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3001.422s">I</a>  thank my colleague for adding that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3003.003s">That's</a>  a very valid point. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3006.164s">A</a>  few more, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3008.485s">Offered</a>  by Council Penta, that the Treasurer supply a complete accounting of all revolving accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3013.967s">We</a>  know how important it is to get up-to-date information on revolving accounts within this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3020.43s">Offered</a>  by Vice President Lungo-Koehn, the Treasurer supply all income from Hormel, Tufts, Wrights Pond. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3028.747s">in</a>  the pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3030.369s">Offered</a>  by Council of Penta Auditor Auditor supply any shortfalls in water and sewer projections offered by myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3038.275s">The</a>  Water and Sewer Commission provide the council with water consumption for the last three years on school and municipal buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3045.702s">These</a>  four have been unanswered to date, Mr. President, and I'm sure they're going to take time to put together, but they have been unanswered. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3053.817s">Several</a>  more, offered by Councilor Caraviello that investigate how the square can be brightened up with better lighting. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3060.88s">That</a>  was offered to the head of wires in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3065.942s">Offered</a>  by Councilor Penta that National Grid address the lack of lighting at the Winthrop Street Rotary. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3071.644s">Offered</a>  by Councilor Marks that we get a complete cost usage analysis per street light. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3077.846s">We</a>  found out in that meeting, Mr. President, that we pay a set fee <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3083.12s">no</a>  matter if our streetlights are on or off. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3087.841s">So</a>  you can imagine a city this size if we have, you know, 700 or 800 streetlights that are out. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3093.743s">We're</a>  still paying a cost for a streetlight that's out. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3098.484s">That's</a>  very important, because you know who's paying that? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3100.984s">Every</a>  taxpayer in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3103.185s">And</a>  if that was at your business or at your home, and you were paying for a light that wasn't working, it's one thing if the light's out and you're not paying for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3111.087s">You</a>  say, I'm not paying for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3113.05s">but</a>  to pay for something that you're not getting use of, and also to address the issues that we have throughout our community with areas that are darkened, that's a concern that needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3126.4s">And</a>  that's another question that was not answered within the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3130.704s">And</a>  we were trying to go through all the papers we received from the administration and the questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3137.849s">I</a>  may have skipped over a few, but there were a number of issues <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3142.225s">that</a>  still present with this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3145.266s">And</a>  I'm not sure how anyone that wants to be financially responsible and be mindful of the taxpayer in this community can support a budget that doesn't represent the questions that were asked, Mr. President, by this legislative body. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3163.534s">I</a>  would say the most important role of this legislative body is the approving of the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3169.497s">And</a>  in my opinion, to try to move forward, I realize, you know, there's only a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3174.979s">We</a>  have next Tuesday, and we get a call for an emergency meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3178.78s">You</a>  as the council president, you know the rules and regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3181.32s">You</a>  can call for an emergency meeting at any time. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3183.761s">So</a>  if we wanted to discuss this Friday, I'm available. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3186.822s">Saturday,</a>  I'm available. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3187.962s">Sunday,</a>  I'm available. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3189.603s">And</a>  I'm sure every other member behind this reel is available. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3192.523s">So</a>  I don't want to hear that there's not enough time and we have to do this on behalf <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3198.538s">being</a>  financially responsible to put out a budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3200.699s">So,</a>  you know, that's a lot of hoss. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3204.921s">You</a>  know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3205.901s">And</a>  so I would ask, Mr. President, that we take a step back. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3212.825s">Let's</a>  take a step back. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3214.325s">Let's</a>  get these questions answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3217.047s">And</a>  I'm not against. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3217.767s">There's</a>  a lot of good things. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3218.828s">As</a>  the superintendent said, there's a lot of positive things happening on the school side that are reflective in this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3224.65s">On</a>  the city side, there's a lot of new hirings. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3227.432s">We</a>  hired someone. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3229.056s">for</a>  the opiate crisis we have in the community to oversee that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3232.879s">In</a>  our community, there's a lot of positive things happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3236.441s">But</a>  that's not just rush through a budget for the sake of rushing it through. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3241.103s">We've</a>  spent countless hours going through this. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3243.605s">Let's</a>  wait for the answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3245.126s">And</a>  then at the appropriate time, we'll take a vote one way or another. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3248.748s">But</a>  that's wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3249.348s">This</a>  is not the appropriate time I would submit to you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3252.33s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3254.297s">Mr.</a>  President, if I may just address two of the questions or points that were made. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3260.399s">The</a>  first one with respect to the Council on Aging that was responded to by the mayor that he would take it under advisement. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3267.062s">And</a>  now I can't remember whether I was here last week or the week before, but I believe I was here. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3273.205s">Was</a>  it the week before on transfers? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3275.546s">The</a>  Council on Aging had not fully expended its expense budget, and that was one of the lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3281.715s">that</a>  had a surplus from which we were transferring out of. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3285.376s">And</a>  I just want to remind the council of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3288.077s">The</a>  second thing is regarding the one-year warranty. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3292.278s">The</a>  fire stations I have requested that I get a list of any items at the fire stations that may not be working properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3302.821s">The</a>  fire station project was closed last December, so the renovations were accepted by the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3310.207s">And</a>  this is the warranty period for any item that might need further either repairs or one of the common issues are temperature controls need to be adjusted during the course of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3324.151s">And</a>  I have requested that a list of any issues at any of the fire stations be provided with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3331.134s">I</a>  would not hope that we would let a one-year warranty period pass without addressing the issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3336.135s">The</a>  DPW, we have not</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3339.175s">Point</a>  of clarification, Madam Vice President.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3341.876s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3342.736s">Thank</a>  you, President Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3343.936s">I</a>  understand what you're saying, Louise. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3347.277s">But</a>  one issue that was brought up with regards to the one-year warranty is we asked the chief himself, who is inspecting these? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3355.759s">Who</a>  is trying to get this work repaired? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3357.879s">And</a>  he said, well, that's on me. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3360.28s">So</a>  that's the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3361.32s">So</a>  I understand you asked somebody to do it, but who did you ask? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3364.421s">Because</a>  it's unacceptable to ask the fire chief, who has all his <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3368.625s">was</a>  preparing a budget the last probably few weeks who has personnel issues and issues galore, I'm sure, has a full-time job to go in and say whether or not a floor was done incorrectly. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3380.733s">We</a>  have no idea if somebody's going to be hired, if the OPM is going to stay on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3386.737s">That's</a>  what we need to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3387.777s">I</a>  need to know that the mayor's office is going to, whether it's hire or appoint the proper personnel to go in and inspect each one of these jobs <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3398.797s">make</a>  sure it's done right, and hold the contractors responsible, because that should not be the fire chief's job. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3404.521s">And</a>  we haven't got that answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3406.782s">We</a>  just haven't. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3407.783s">It's</a>  $2 million that, whether it's half the work that was done wrong or a quarter or, you know, 10 percent, that's hundreds of thousands of dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3415.568s">We</a>  have a floor that's completely broken, A.C. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3418.33s">that</a>  does not work in one fire station. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3421.212s">There</a>  was a whole host list of issues, because not only did we have the fire chief there, but we also had <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3426.418s">you</a>  know, the head of the union there with his people. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3429.96s">So</a>  they're speaking out. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3431.582s">And</a>  it's something that needs to be fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3434.043s">We</a>  need to make sure that $2 million was done, all the jobs were done accordingly. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3439.947s">And</a>  if we have this six-month warranty, we need to take advantage of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3444.931s">Because</a>  if the fire chief comes back and says he needs a new floor two years from now, whether I'm on the council or any of us are on the council, I'm going to lose it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3454.485s">I</a>  will lose it for the taxpayer's behalf. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3457.466s">I</a>  will lose it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3458.367s">It's</a>  just not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3459.167s">It's</a>  not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3460.047s">And</a>  that's something that we need to know who's going to go into that fire station, who's going to go into the DPW yard, and make sure things are done correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3468.691s">So</a>  you're asking for the personnel is the question? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3473.153s">I</a>  think my question is, is somebody from the building department, are we going to hire a new OPM, who is going to do it, and when? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3479.715s">We</a>  have six months left with the fire station. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3482.246s">little</a>  less than one year for the DPW yard, which is millions and millions of dollars of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3488.029s">And</a>  I just don't want to have to pay for any of that work all over again, two, three, four, five years down the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3493.671s">I</a>  mean, taxes go up every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3496.092s">I</a>  always ask that we don't tax to the max. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3500.514s">It</a>  never happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3501.775s">I</a>  can never get the four votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3503.155s">But</a>  we at least, if we're still going to tax the max, then we at least, and we're going to go out to bond for these projects, we at least owe the taxpayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3513.193s">the</a>  word to say that we've gone out, we've reviewed all the work, it's done to the liking, we have A, B, C, and D out back to the contractor asking them to fix the floor, the air conditioning, everything that's done wrong, we want it fixed and we want it fixed before the warranty's up.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3543.687s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3544.367s">You</a>  know, um, a lot of these, a lot of council members concerns and they're not necessarily budget concerns, but, uh, it's because we don't have a clerk of the works that oversees these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3555.555s">And</a>  that's something that's been needed in this community for a long time.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3559.057s">And</a>  we asked that as part of that.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3560.438s">I</a>  know we did ask for that, but again, that's, that's been, that's part of the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3563.7s">That's</a>  it's not Louisa's fault. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3565.221s">It's</a>  not the, but it's an administration, uh, fault. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3569.03s">We</a>  don't have that precedent. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3570.35s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3570.711s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3571.271s">Miller.</a> </p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3572.751s">I</a>  know. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3573.711s">I</a>  just want to clarify again. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3574.932s">The</a>  construction project had a project manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3578.973s">The</a>  project manager oversaw the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3581.713s">There</a>  was a closeout. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3582.894s">There</a>  was a punch list before closeout of the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3586.695s">So</a>  we're not talking about whether or not the project product was acceptable to the city, because the city did accept it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3593.897s">All</a>  we're talking about are the issues that arise after construction ends. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3599.07s">that</a>  may need to be addressed during the one-year warranty period, which we just did, by the way, recently with the science lab. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3607.073s">We</a>  had our one-year warranty walkthrough. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3608.794s">That</a>  project is closed out, and any outstanding issues have been closed out.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3616.057s">Councilor</a>  Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3618.258s">Louise,</a>  we just went through a couple of weeks ago a transfer at the end of the year budget of over a million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3625.361s">And</a>  you just got through saying a few minutes ago <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3628.415s">that</a>  there was some surplus money that was left in the senior account. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3636.157s">I</a>  believe it's $5,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3637.798s">Is</a>  that what you were looking for? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3639.638s">Now,</a>  why would the mayor have to go back and say he would take it under advisement when we're talking about $5,000? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3644.44s">It's</a>  a surplus. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3647.081s">Why</a>  is this even being brought up, point number one, as a discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3650.542s">I</a>  don't understand it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3651.942s">Because</a>  again, to transfer a million dollars at the end of the year, <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3655.722s">It</a>  isn't just this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3656.943s">I</a>  mean, this is new to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3657.864s">This</a>  is your first year here in the city of Medford, but this seems to have been a generic issue each and every year transfer of all this money of all this money. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3666.67s">And</a>  for the first time this year, the department heads have been really been honest and maybe they're coming out of their shell to tell us how they really feel. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3675.377s">Now</a>  you've been there to hear it and you will see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3677.298s">And</a>  I asked you on every one of the department heads to tell us your wishlist. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3681.201s">This</a>  is what this council has asked for. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3683.124s">a</a>  wish list of each department head before we get the budget so we could understand it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3687.406s">And</a>  some of them said they never met, and some of them said they did meet. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3691.428s">And</a>  you were honest enough to say in a couple of them, you met with them on the day of the budget hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3696.39s">And</a>  you were also honest enough when the question was asked of you, the way the budget was presented, would you present the budget in the same fashion? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3703.233s">And</a>  your answer was no. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3704.914s">And</a>  I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3706.574s">So</a>  taking that and putting that all together and listening to two department heads in particular, engineer, <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3712.571s">and</a>  the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3713.892s">Both</a>  of them had made requests, very simple requests. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3718.276s">Let's</a>  take the engineering office. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3722.659s">Four</a>  people using one phone, a desk that all they want upstairs so they could work on it, file cabinets, and an integrated technology system to the computer, a $30,000 hit, and they were told no. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3738.112s">And</a>  when the question was asked in the engineering department, <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3741.222s">Did</a>  you ever present that to the budget director? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3743.063s">Not</a>  you, the former budget director. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3744.724s">She</a>  said yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3745.744s">And</a>  she said how many times? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3747.245s">Four</a>  years in a row. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3749.045s">And</a>  she just happened to have two of those years with her. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3752.847s">And</a>  she was told by the then budget director, no, you could not put it in. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3757.269s">When</a>  the gentleman who was the library director was asked the same question on his wish list, he said for the last four years he had been making this presentation to the budget director. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3767.954s">And</a>  she told him, no, you cannot put it in. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3771.093s">Now,</a>  he's a little bit different than her, because he doesn't like confrontation. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3774.794s">And</a>  he'll probably tow the line, because he knows that the mayor is his boss. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3779.234s">But</a>  I'll compliment the engineer, because she did turn around. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3782.435s">And</a>  she was a little bit upset, because you can't run an office with four people using one phone, not have a file cabinet that's acceptable to hold the documents, a working station, and to have some type of computer. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3794.617s">Now,</a>  I think when Mr. Moki was here, and he's in charge of the building department, he had asked for something, again, <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3800.79s">I</a>  think it was $30,000, $40,000, and that's to integrate the entire system so people could jump onto it for the purposes of reviewing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3808.355s">These</a>  are the working instruments that these department heads need. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3813.158s">And</a>  when you turn around and try to explain to the taxpayer, you have $6.5 million in surplus, and we have $7.5 million, $7.5 million in our water and sewer enterprise account because we're trying to stay financially stable. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3827.567s">Well,</a>  I'm going to lead into the <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3829.501s">report,</a>  the 2014 report ending by our outside consultant that says the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3836.505s">The</a>  city does not have a formal investment policy that limits investment maturities as a means of managing its exposure to fair value losses arising from increasing interest rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3848.892s">Now,</a>  we hear all around here that this city is so well maintained in its bond rating and what it goes out to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3855.515s">Now,</a>  here's an outside auditing company and says we have no <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3859.21s">formal</a>  investment policy to protect us in that particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3864.213s">So</a>  who are we to believe? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3866.354s">The</a>  city administration or the outside consultant, Melanson and Heath, who does the audit in that particular part? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3872.918s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3873.958s">We've</a>  asked for an update on the parking tickets from Republic in the abatements that have come forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3879.522s">We</a>  still haven't gotten that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3881.523s">We</a>  haven't gotten a report back of whether, in fact, there is going to be a water and sewer rate increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3886.646s">We</a>  got a report back from the Water and Sewer Commission <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3889.515s">indicating</a>  the amount of usage that's gone up and the amount of usage in their wastewater treatment that's gone up. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3897.6s">We</a>  still don't have anything that's definitive that's going to tell us that are we going to get an increase or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3903.903s">Let's</a>  go to the fire stations that both Councilor Marks and Councilor Lungo-Koehn has alluded to. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3907.565s">$2</a>  million is not chump change. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3912.368s">$2</a>  million represents the taxpayers' money being put into buildings <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3916.927s">to</a>  make sure that firefighters in the respective houses that they're in have what they need. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3923.228s">On</a>  that particular night, when I believe the gentleman who was the president of the firefighters was here, he indicated he had a difference of opinion with the chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3929.71s">And</a>  that's OK, having a difference of opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3932.27s">But</a>  the difference of opinion should not have been had there before the council, because if we had this wish list to discuss it, we'd have this opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3939.251s">I</a>  don't think the question asked by Councilor Lungo-Koehn, <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3942.817s">should</a>  get anybody upset, because that's just good project management. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3946.438s">And</a>  since we don't have a clerk of the works, who's going to be the project manager on any of these jobs or all of these jobs once the things go wrong? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3954.441s">We</a>  built a new fire station in South Medford, and I think the building didn't even make it through its first year when they had leaks and air conditioning and heating problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3963.464s">And</a>  that's a multimillion-dollar building, not a $2 million building. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3967.946s">So</a>  my colleagues are right making these questions and asking these questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3971.818s">Because</a>  why should we as the tax, strike that, why should we as representatives of the taxpayers have to come back at a later date to say we got a bond for this and we have to bond for that, or we have to pay for this and pay for that, when in fact we really shouldn't have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3985.469s">You</a>  know, we just got through building a new public works building, a brand new public works building for approximately $14 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3992.595s">And</a>  the reason why the old building fell apart is because the city had no maintenance program for any of its buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=3999.635s">The</a>  reason why the library got itself in so much trouble is because, A, the library director was denied what he needed for money. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4007.48s">And</a>  number two, how could you take for six years in a row and get a waiver to your certification with the state, which is approximately $225,000 per year? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4016.366s">A</a>  waiver is only good for maybe one, two years max. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4019.328s">And</a>  we were really running the string on that one there. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4022.149s">And</a>  then to turn around and say, we found the money in some kind of a construction development, and we're going to generate that $225,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4029.784s">That</a>  is bull in plain English. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4031.865s">When</a>  you're sitting on reserves, cash reserves, that are the taxpayers' money of this community, and you can't put a legitimate budget out, line item by line item, that identifies the actual cost of needs, the required cost of needs, that's not a true budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4048.335s">And</a>  I don't think to some degree that this budget that's presented, and it's not your budget that you presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4052.897s">I</a>  know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4053.678s">I</a>  know you walked into this position late on, and I believe when you were asked the question and you answered it honestly, <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4059.197s">You</a>  would not be presenting this type of a budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4061.298s">It</a>  would include the wish list. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4062.899s">It</a>  would include cost and expenditures, actuals, and it would have everything broken down. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4068.001s">We</a>  shouldn't have to ask now for these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4071.723s">We</a>  shouldn't have to ask for revolving accounts for expenditures and revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4077.485s">That</a>  should just come automatically. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4079.366s">And</a>  boards and commissions, that should have all been presented to us during this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4083.888s">Not,</a>  well, maybe next year we'll have a representative from each board. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4086.95s">It</a>  shouldn't work that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4088.728s">This</a>  is the only time of the year when the taxpayers of this community can actually see their tax dollars at work. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4095.571s">And</a>  for us to be put into a position tonight to vote on something with multiple questions still to be answered is wrong and it's unfair. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4103.795s">I'll</a>  ask you, Councilor Caraviello, with all due respect, if you would withdraw your vote and allow this to sit on the table for a week so we can answer these questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4113.46s">And</a>  then that way, I think we could all be on the same page and we can let our votes fall the way they may be. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4118.243s">because</a>  I think it's just unfair right now, with so many questions that are still lingering, to have a vote with these still outstanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4125.486s">So</a>  I ask you, with all due respect.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4132.249s">Again,</a>  I mean, it was just my vote? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4134.15s">I</a>  mean, was I the only vote that? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4137.011s">Vote</a>  was four to three. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4138.471s">But</a>  there was four other people who voted. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4140.932s">Pardon</a>  me? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4141.352s">Mr.</a>  President?</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4142.693s">Councilor</a>  Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4146.677s">I'm</a>  not going to speak for Councilor Caraviello, but to specifically ask one councilor to change their vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4151.981s">I</a>  mean, I just, no one's asking me to change my vote or other people that may have voted on the other side. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4158.525s">Take</a>  the vote and see where it goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4159.586s">It</a>  won't fail because you're voting for it tonight.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4162.087s">It's</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4162.428s">Why</a>  can't you wait till next week?</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4198.827s">I</a>  would just make a general comment that indeed, you know, we will make our best effort to answer all of the outstanding questions and that <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4208.831s">to</a>  the extent that there are questions that are not budget related. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4213.114s">I</a>  would be happy to discuss all of those items further with the council.</p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4228.406s">My</a>  name is Michael Leggero. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4229.687s">I</a>  live on 18 Pembroke Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4232.228s">It</a>  is disturbing the rate and speed at which this budget has moved through these chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4239.392s">I've</a>  seen all of the members of this council work a number of weeks to try to figure it out, but it's been so compressed to try to get things through. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4249.599s">To</a>  vote on this budget and hope that answers come on the back end is literally putting the cart before the horse. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4258.005s">If</a>  the answer is literally, oh, we'll work and look into it, the budget is fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4263.049s">That's</a>  an answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4263.609s">It</a>  doesn't have to be a proper answer or an answer that satisfies everyone here. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4268.366s">Let's</a>  look at our two possibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4271.027s">What</a>  happens if we don't pass this budget tonight and we look at it next week or we come to an emergency meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4276.488s">Medford's</a>  not going to fall apart in flames. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4279.049s">There</a>  are no creditors like those Capital One commercials where the Vikings come off the mountains. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4283.91s">It's</a>  going to be fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4284.99s">We're</a>  going to survive it for a couple of days. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4287.231s">What's</a>  the other option? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4288.391s">What's</a>  the other possibility that this budget is passed? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4291.711s">and</a>  these answers aren't come about. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4294.352s">The</a>  fire station falls apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4296.833s">Lights</a>  still don't exist on Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4300.374s">Our</a>  views, our city begins to crumble. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4303.796s">I</a>  urge you, do not do the easy thing on passing this budget and hoping answers come down the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4311.939s">Make</a>  sure that answers come about now. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4314.62s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4319.912s">Some</a>  of the questions asked are not budget-related. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4321.933s">I</a>  mean, so that's, you know, not every question that's asked affects the bottom line of the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4330.316s">A</a>  budget is a moral document. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4331.717s">I</a>  know what a budget is.</p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4332.877s">I</a>  know what a budget is.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4333.858s">Direct</a>  our questions through the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4335.558s">I</a>  know what a budget is, and you know our role, what this council can do with this budget.</p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4343.241s">A</a>  budget, if money is being allocated to something, and it's not being used properly, <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4348.067s">The</a>  budget is the proper place to discuss those issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4351.288s">That's</a>  what a budget is for. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4353.028s">If</a>  I spend $100, if I give my wife $1,000 to spend on groceries for the next three weeks, and she comes back only with ice cream.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4361.59s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Schiaffiello. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4364.51s">The</a>  budget they represented is not an actual budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4367.331s">It's</a>  a budget summary. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4369.151s">So</a>  it's very hard to vote on a budget that gives us minimal information in general.</p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4374.709s">Well,</a>  don't vote on a budget if you don't have the answers to these basic questions.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4377.932s">I'll</a>  never have the answers because, again, that's not what the budget director before Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4383.296s">Miller</a>  provided us. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4385.097s">This</a>  is my fourth time in the budget, and the budget hasn't improved not one bit because it's not presented to us in a proper fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4394.845s">And</a>  that's the main part of the problem here.</p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4397.227s">With</a>  all due respect, Councilor, to have a resolution <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4401.76s">that</a>  you'll approve the budget in hope that answers will come.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4406.684s">The</a>  resolution is conditional.</p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4411.748s">The</a>  budget passes on the condition of the responses. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4417.013s">What</a>  answer would satisfy you if it's, we're working on it?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4419.915s">No,</a>  that's not an answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4422.417s">That's</a>  not an answer we're working on. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4423.678s">Mr.</a>  President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4424.879s">Councilor</a>  Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4429.263s">The</a>  question before us is for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4431.552s">On</a>  the motion for approval by Councilor Camuso, as amended by Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4438.737s">I</a>  think there's other people that want to speak here.</p>

    <p>[Sorrell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4443.58s">Doctor,</a>  please state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4445.962s">John</a>  Straw, 20 Metcalf Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4448.804s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you for listening to me, but I'm going to be short and sweet, but I want to resolve this once and for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4457.093s">The</a>  budget as proposed by the mayor, as it has been for 27 years, will be passed as it is proposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4466.34s">The</a>  budget is for $156 million, and this council will pass $156 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4472.966s">That</a>  is exactly correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4480.408s">And</a>  what I want to say is whether this council votes for the budget or does not vote for the budget, it will take effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4487.993s">It</a>  always has. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4488.994s">And</a>  it always will. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4490.535s">That</a>  is the law we operate under a charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4493.998s">And</a>  the charter says that when the mayor proposes a budget, he does not need the approval of the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4501.643s">These</a>  Councilors who say yes, pass the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4505.886s">Either</a>  way, the budget will pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4508.368s">Wait</a>  and see. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4509.847s">Thank</a>  you, John.</p>

    <p>[6YHU7Hws2SA_SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4517.211s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4519.112s">Yes,</a>  good evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4519.872s">Mark</a>  Crowley, 59 Boynton Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4522.174s">I</a>  simply would just find it unbelievable that if there are, in fact, questions that can be answered within a week, I simply have to ask, what is the rush? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4532.86s">If</a>  these things can be answered and we appropriately can do the due diligence that is necessary to get these questions answered, <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4539.728s">let's</a>  defer, and let's move it on to another week. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4543.011s">You</a>  know, I work by trade as a director of finance for a $300 million software company. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4547.814s">I'm</a>  responsible for putting budgets together. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4550.316s">I</a>  take careful consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4552.177s">I</a>  meet with department heads, much like how you folks have been doing over the past several weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4557.141s">I</a>  do not give that a green light until all questions have been answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4561.725s">I</a>  am a steward for the shareholders' money, much like how the city council is a steward for the taxpayers' money. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4568.184s">Now,</a>  I'm sure there's not a resident in this town that wouldn't get into a contract or sign a contract with an individual or a contractor to do their kitchen without asking some appropriate questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4579.246s">That's</a>  a significant investment that a lot of homeowners will do. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4582.027s">But</a>  you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4582.507s">Instead</a>  of $50,000, we're using, I think it was $155,032, or whatever the number was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4588.969s">I</a>  think the taxpayers are entitled to the same level of due diligence as we would do ourselves in our own homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4596.385s">So</a>  as it's been noted, the single most important responsibility this council has is to approve the budget of this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4606.207s">to</a>  approve the hard-earned dollars, to ensure that those dollars are being spent in the most effective and responsible manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4613.849s">It's</a>  a critical check and balance. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4616.13s">You</a>  know, we talk a lot about the power that this mayor has. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4619.351s">He's</a>  a strong mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4620.971s">Well,</a>  the one check and balance that the city council can truly impart is approval of that budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4628.193s">And</a>  if that means taking another week to get some answers, questions, by God, get those answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4634.575s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4635.416s">What's</a>  the rush? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4635.976s">I</a>  simply ask, what is the intent? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4637.798s">Why</a>  are we trying to rush it through? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4639.879s">What</a>  are we trying to hide? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4641.62s">Let's</a>  take the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4642.861s">Let's</a>  do the due diligence. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4644.623s">Get</a>  the questions answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4646.884s">So</a>  again, you've invested significant time. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4649.266s">You</a>  know, we've seen what happens when budgets or, more importantly, legislation gets passed, when legislators say, gosh, you know, I didn't have time to read it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4657.893s">Or,</a>  you know what, they admit that, you know, I didn't fully understand it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4661.182s">We</a>  have collectively understood that we do have the time, we do have the opportunity to read and get some simple questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4668.124s">Maybe</a>  we want all the questions are budget-related, but if there's just one question that's budget-related, well, let's spend that extra week and get that question answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4677.546s">We'll</a>  come back next Tuesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4679.206s">We'll</a>  come back next Saturday night. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4680.827s">Come</a>  on to my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4681.527s">We'll</a>  have a barbecue. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4682.227s">You</a>  can improve the budget at my backyard. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4684.327s">We</a>  can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4684.708s">You've</a>  got that house across the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4685.928s">That's</a>  true. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4687.45s">I'm</a>  going to get that one knocked down. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4689.071s">So</a>  anyways, please, just do the taxpayers a favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4692.713s">Don't</a>  forget favors. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4693.974s">Do</a>  what you're asked, what you're voted to do, and take the time and be responsible and get the questions asked and come back next week and come back with an intelligent answer and approval to this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4706.261s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4712.844s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4713.425s">Welcome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4713.885s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record, Senator.</p>

    <p>[Robert Cappucci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4717.103s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4718.223s">I'm</a>  Robert Cappucci of 71 Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4721.705s">Just</a>  a few questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4724.126s">What</a>  department heads failed to give answers to the questions that you asked?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4732.309s">If</a>  I could, from the chair, explain to you that that has been announced in the remarks of some of the councillors. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4744.554s">Point</a>  of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4745.435s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4746.762s">Thank</a>  you, President Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4748.582s">Now,</a>  some of these answers are complex, and it will take some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4752.023s">And</a>  we met with department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4754.643s">We</a>  started three and a half weeks ago, and we actually just met with departments last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4759.244s">So</a>  I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4759.904s">I'm</a>  not putting blame on anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4761.525s">We</a>  just haven't got the answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4762.825s">But</a>  we have some electrical questions out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4766.125s">The</a>  treasurer, chief of police, the OPM, which is the operation manager for all the bigger projects that have been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4775.035s">And</a>  then I believe we still have some water and sewer questions left out, because there is a, we have concern there's a deficit in the water and sewer account of almost a million dollars.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4787.885s">Thank</a>  you for your point of information, Madam Vice President.</p>

    <p>[Robert Cappucci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4790.868s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4792.329s">Thank</a>  you very much, Councilor Lungo-Koehn, for your proposal to table this until next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4799.255s">I</a>  want to thank all the other residents that came before and spoke. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4803.238s">I</a>  also want to thank Councilors <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4805.325s">Pinto</a>  and Marks for their comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4810.146s">It's</a>  odd to me that city councilors will bring up other issues such as the massage parlors or other things that are going wrong in this city based upon the administration's willingness or not to get a certain thing done. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4829.431s">And</a>  then the one power that the city council truly has <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4834.535s">You're</a>  not going to have the political will to rise up and make a stand with that and speak on behalf of the voters that put you in office. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4844.645s">It's</a>  literally beyond my comprehension that you won't do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4851.432s">November</a>  3rd is Election Day, and elections have consequences. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4857.858s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4863.325s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4863.885s">Welcome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4864.386s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4907.756s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Camuso for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4910.478s">Roll</a>  call vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4911.339s">Roll</a>  call vote has been requested. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4913.0s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4916.225s">This</a>  paper has been tabled already. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4918.565s">Section</a>  22 cannot be invoked, Madam Vice President.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4921.346s">This</a>  is the revised. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4923.046s">Point</a>  of information, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4924.967s">It's</a>  an amended paper.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4926.747s">It's</a>  a revised. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4928.267s">Mr.</a>  President, challenge the chair and take a vote.</p>

    <p>[v8c6yqLwu5E_SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4935.669s">This</a>  is not a new paper.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4939.81s">This</a>  has happened many times in the past.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4945.928s">Louise</a>  Miller, could you please come to the podium, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4953.714s">Did</a>  you or did you not give us a revised budget this evening, dollar amounts? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4961.0s">It's</a>  revised, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4962.382s">It's</a>  not the original one that was submitted.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4964.543s">Point</a>  of information, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4965.644s">Is</a>  that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4966.225s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4969.167s">If</a>  we just go back to the beginning of this meeting, the paper that I took <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4975.067s">off</a>  of the council calendar was the one from the committee and not the new paper that is on the council agenda that I'm sure later on, if this is acted upon, will be received and placed on file or withdrawn like it has in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4990.677s">I'm</a>  not speaking for the administration, but is that the intent?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4995.76s">Madam</a>  Louise, well, the word says revised right up above. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5000.083s">Revised</a>  means it's different.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5003.124s">It's</a>  a different paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5004.045s">It's</a>  a different paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5007.627s">And</a>  we're not discussing the other paper right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5010.208s">We're</a>  discussing paper 15 460 has been called up.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5016.371s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5018.312s">In</a>  light of everyone and to make everyone happy, I will resume my vote here so we can table for next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5025.874s">And</a>  I hate to agree with Mr. Starello, but Mr. Starello is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5028.456s">We're</a>  going to come back next week and we're going to vote on the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5037.424s">There</a>  was nothing to clap about. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5038.745s">Mr.</a>  Starello was right with his statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5040.287s">Point</a>  of clarification.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5041.268s">Wait</a>  a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5042.008s">Wait</a>  a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5042.469s">Point</a>  of Mr. Starello is wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5044.411s">Cause</a>  the, if you look at the department of local services rules that just were re promulgated in May of 2015, <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5052.233s">a</a>  local city council or a town council has to vote approval on a budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5057.297s">And</a>  as a matter of fact, the new rulings, if the city council wants to add to a budget that has not been included in the budget, this time you can add to the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5066.943s">So</a>  I think, I think everybody started.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5069.045s">There</a>  was a motion on the floor for approval.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5083.114s">Section</a>  22 was invoked incorrectly because the paper was brought before us, was tabled previously, and the paper before us was one that was brought off the floor and out of the Committee of the Whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5099.563s">Councilor</a>  Camuso has a paper before us for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5104.246s">Councilor,</a>  do you wish to move this paper? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5106.787s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5108.238s">No,</a>  he can't do that until after this paper is ruled upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5110.099s">This</a>  paper has to be acted upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5111.52s">That's</a>  at a different time of the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5113.041s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Camuso for approval, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[v8c6yqLwu5E_SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5117.744s">Mr.</a>  President, it seems to me members of this council are talking like they're legal experts. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5124.948s">I</a>  mean, since when is Councilor Camuso the city solicitant?</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5130.931s">No,</a>  I know the rules, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5131.932s">That's</a>  why I was voted president. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5133.493s">You</a>  haven't been the president since you've been here.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5134.914s">Since</a>  when is he the city solicitant, Mr. President?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5137.881s">We</a>  have a motion for approval before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5139.801s">We'll</a>  act on it.</p>

    <p>[v8c6yqLwu5E_SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5142.402s">The</a>  Council of Caraviello will call for reconsideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5145.382s">But</a>  that's not the vote we're on right now.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5146.983s">We're</a>  on a motion right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5149.143s">So</a>  we have an action before us that needs to be acted upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5152.544s">And</a>  what action is that, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5154.184s">For</a>  approval of the budget 15-460 before us.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5158.865s">It</a>  can't be because you have a revised document that she just talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5163.305s">Why</a>  would you vote on an old one when you have a revised one?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5167.334s">rule</a>  the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5169.435s">We</a>  have a motion for approval on paper 15 for 60 as amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5174.956s">Move</a>  section 22. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5177.076s">You</a>  cannot, that the paper was tabled and already and taken off the table and sent into committee.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5183.878s">Mrs.</a>  Milner-Lewis just indicated that she presented a revised document here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5192.08s">How</a>  can you vote on something that's been revised?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5198.37s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5200.491s">Parliamentary</a>  procedure aside, I think that the budget before us is a good budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5206.413s">The</a>  budget before us provides with a number of technology changes at Medford High School and at Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5212.896s">It</a>  moves away from standardized test teaching and towards whole person teaching, as Superintendent Belson said. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5219.078s">It</a>  establishes a new full-time code enforcement officer that this council fought for for a year and a half, two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5224.402s">It</a>  establishes a substance abuse coordinator's position that this council's been looking for for a year and a half, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5229.604s">It</a>  also funds the facilities manager at our school buildings, a facilities manager who's actually put in a preventative maintenance plan at our schools.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5239.926s">I</a>  just have to say that none of that is going to change in one week.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5250.589s">And,</a>  Mr. President, I don't think some of the questions that we asked about capital projects <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5253.863s">that</a>  aren't related to the budget are going to change the actual bottom line of the budget either. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5257.666s">I</a>  think that what's important for us to do is to take a look at this budget and to determine whether or not it's a good budget or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5262.51s">And</a>  I think it is a good budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5263.45s">And</a>  looking at it, I think one of the biggest things is that it saves the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5267.954s">It</a>  saves the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5268.775s">It</a>  gives a quarter of a million dollars increase in funding to the library to keep the library certified, meets state certification standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5276.661s">The</a>  council has asked for several things. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5277.862s">We've</a>  gotten several things that are put into this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5280.023s">I</a>  think it's a good budget, Mr. President, and I move approval.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5296.597s">That's</a>  the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5297.337s">I</a>  am not going to put myself in this type of a position. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5299.739s">It's</a>  absolutely ridiculous.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5332.413s">Mr.</a>  President, you know, week after week, it's the same people that get up here on every single issue, and they should be able to. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5342.776s">This</a>  is the People's Forum, and they bring their... There has been not one person, other than the library group, that came up here on this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5355.2s">On</a>  this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5356.34s">This</a>  is a budget that's adding several key components that this city council's pushed for over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5362.957s">They're</a>  working on a dog park right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5365.259s">They're</a>  working on the substance abuse. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5368.823s">Coordinator</a>  is in this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5370.485s">Code</a>  enforcement officer is in this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5373.128s">The</a>  superintendent of schools is adding adjustment Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5376.772s">We</a>  haven't seen adjustment Councilors in how long, Mr. Superintendent? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5381.477s">Quite</a>  a long period of time.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5386.186s">Not</a>  one person behind this reel did I hear tonight say this was not a good budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5390.875s">All</a>  we asked for merely was to get our questions answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5395.144s">So</a>  that's... <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5397.803s">Can</a>  I finish? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5398.783s">That's</a>  a red herring talking about the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5401.504s">That</a>  money is going to be in the budget for next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5403.685s">All</a>  these positions, that money is going to be in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5406.766s">All</a>  we want is our questions answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5409.267s">And</a>  to stifle those questions, or to say because no one — well, Mr. President — It's a point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5414.989s">Yeah,</a>  and other colleagues have had a long point of information, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5418.19s">If</a>  I could finish my point, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5419.85s">Please</a>  do. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5420.751s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5422.011s">And</a>  to say because no one came up to the real, or no one came to the Committee of the Whole meeting that we had, <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5427.715s">that</a>  everyone's content with this, and we should move approval, is a ridiculous argument, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5433.817s">And</a>  that's all I need to say on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5436.638s">Mr.</a>  President.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5695.47s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5695.831s">My</a>  name is John Gannon. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5697.432s">I</a>  work for O'Connor Constructors. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5699.733s">We're</a>  a construction manager building a project for Tufts University on Boston Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5705.056s">And</a>  there's three changes that need to be done in the city sidewalk by National Grid in order for us to build our project.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5713.722s">So</a>  you're here on behalf of Tufts University. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5715.783s">You're</a>  not here on behalf of the project.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5718.002s">I'm</a>  here on behalf of Tufts University, that's correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5721.663s">Normally</a>  National Grid would come to this meeting, but they're on emergency duty tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5727.084s">So</a>  instead of having nobody show, Tufts decided to send their construction manager instead of someone from National Grid.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5734.645s">I</a>  think in all fairness to the project, and I can appreciate you being here, but you're not the applicant.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5741.867s">National</a>  Grid is the applicant. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5743.487s">I</a>  do have the ability to answer questions about the proposal, though.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5748.486s">Go</a>  ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5749.166s">Well,</a>  I just don't know if you could even pass on this because he's not the legitimate applicant.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5757.331s">I</a>  can explain what we're asking to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5761.113s">Yeah,</a>  go ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5762.434s">We're</a>  going to build a new construction project on Boston Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5766.516s">And</a>  that requires, typically any construction project requires temporary power. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5771.599s">And</a>  in order to get enough temporary power, they have to add a temporary power pole in the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5778.074s">That</a>  at the end of the project, approximately 16 months from now, will be removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5783.496s">And</a>  it's all on Tufts property, so we're not affecting any neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5788.378s">Another</a>  element is there's an existing utility pole that's in the way of the new service drive to the new building that we're building. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5796.161s">That</a>  needs to be moved over 35 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5798.182s">And</a>  once again, that's not affecting any of Tufts neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5802.024s">It's</a>  on their own sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5803.124s">Well,</a>  it's on your sidewalk in front of their property. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5806.632s">And</a>  in order to power the new facility, we have to put in several hundred feet of duct bank underneath the city's sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5814.619s">And</a>  it's in our contract, the construction manager's contract, to completely replace that sidewalk once that duct bank is installed.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5823.226s">There's</a>  a line in here that says National Grid will inform the city of any newly installed duct bank that it determines in the future will not be used. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5832.57s">as</a>  the 105-foot length of duct bank that extends from the building service to the pole. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5838.575s">So</a>  the building service to the pole, you're going to have to go over a public sidewalk.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5843.079s">All</a>  the work is under a public sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5845.101s">That's</a>  why it's in the petition, excuse me.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5848.123s">Usually</a>  when we get something like this, Madam Chairperson, we get some kind of response back from our city engineer.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5855.109s">I</a>  believe that's been approved by the city engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5857.191s">Pardon</a>  me? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5857.931s">I</a>  believe it's been approved by the city engineer and the wiring inspector.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5861.968s">It</a>  says approved superintendent-wise, but it doesn't say city engineer.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5865.911s">I'm</a>  looking here on page two. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5867.552s">Approved.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5868.033s">City</a>  engineer, upon review of this petition in the engineering department, based on the engineer's review, the board can proceed forthwith.</p>

    <p>[v8c6yqLwu5E_SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5875.519s">Chief</a>  engineer? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5876.119s">One,</a>  two, three, four.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5886.607s">So</a>  that's what you people call our city engineer chief engineer?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5889.89s">I</a>  believe it's Cassandra. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5891.956s">I</a>  believe is the primary.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5893.877s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5895.258s">That's</a>  it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5895.999s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5897.319s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5898.88s">I</a>  just want to make sure, like I said, you're not the applicant, so if you fill in it, I am.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5902.302s">It's</a>  the best we can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5903.023s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5903.303s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5903.903s">National</a>  grid on a night like this, nobody could show up. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5906.845s">No</a>  problem.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5909.387s">Does</a>  this project have any relation to the easement project that we granted for the construction of the new science labs? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5916.867s">We</a>  granted a permanent underground easement recently for the construction of the new science labs. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5921.229s">Is</a>  this project related to that?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5922.589s">This</a>  is not. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5923.25s">That</a>  is the Science and Engineering Center, which is down the street from us.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6119.278s">Quick</a>  question. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6120.178s">What</a>  did you say? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6120.979s">Is</a>  it 121 feet?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6122.951s">147</a>  feet from the end of the existing main to reach the house that's looking for the gas service.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6129.176s">And</a>  that's on the street.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6130.397s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6131.177s">And</a>  how do you intend to repair the street once you dig it up?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6134.26s">Uh,</a>  put back asphalt, um, in the, the trench that we dig.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6140.084s">Is</a>  this in the middle of the street to the left?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6142.606s">14</a>  feet off the backside of sidewalk to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6145.028s">So</a>  it's pretty much in the gutter.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6146.409s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6146.949s">Well,</a>  if that's the case, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6149.461s">You</a>  realize that the city is implementing — going to be implementing a new policy that, six months after that trench, that — you know, the street better be the way it's supposed to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6158.427s">Because</a>  many times, when you folks go out there, whoever your contractors are, you know, it sinks.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6163.63s">The</a>  trench — The President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6165.652s">We</a>  try not to.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6166.292s">Huh?</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6166.852s">We</a>  try not to.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6167.933s">Well,</a>  you try not to, but drive around the city right now and go look at all the trenches you've dug up. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6175.378s">Move</a>  approval with that — with that condition now, Madam President, that the city — <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6179.218s">review</a>  this subject matter upon completion, six months upon completion.</p>

    <p>[Sharon Deyeso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6248.382s">My</a>  name is Sharon Diesso. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6249.602s">I</a>  live at 130 Circuit Road in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6252.824s">I'm</a>  here on a brief topic that is actually related in one way to the last time I was here a few weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6260.77s">It's</a>  not a sidewalk this time, it's a street. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6263.451s">And</a>  the same day I was looking into this, I happened to bump into <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6270.123s">Councilman</a>  Caraviello, excuse me, I have a very bad cold. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6273.826s">And</a>  he, I was going to look into something, I don't know if it came to fruition because he had to leave the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6282.291s">About</a>  a year ago, while walking through Medford Square, an older woman alighted from the sidewalk after getting on a bus, off a bus, and nearly tumbled forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6296.121s">And</a>  I thought maybe it was my eyesight the second time, <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6300.44s">I</a>  was walking through the square and noticed, you know, because I had had retina surgery a while ago, and I said, maybe it's my eyes. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6307.646s">And</a>  I said, what's going on? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6310.189s">Because</a>  it's hard to see the black hardtop. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6312.671s">There</a>  were rivets from Papageno's all the way down to the CVS, past the donut shop, and on the opposite side of the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6322.259s">I'm</a>  not an engineer, but I would assume this would be caused from the buses, the heat of the buses and the constant weight of the buses moving through the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6331.687s">So</a>  during the year, another woman I also saw almost took a tumble because you were light from the sidewalk thinking that you're going to go this far, but take a walk one day. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6342.756s">And</a>  you know, I don't walk that often myself in that area, but I've gone a few times now and happened to mention it to <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6350.272s">Councilman</a>  Caraviello, and he said, you know, I thought I noticed that, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6353.193s">It's</a>  a real concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6355.513s">It</a>  looks like an ocean. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6357.233s">They're</a>  like this, almost to the middle of the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6360.334s">So</a>  on an appointment near one of the shops on Salem Street one day, I happened to notice the same thing getting out of my car to go over to the hardware store, Dunkin' Donuts, hardware store being one of my <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6378.016s">seems</a>  to be a good errand every single week. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6380.039s">Something's</a>  always going wrong in the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6381.662s">So</a>  I'm saying this can't be happening again. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6386.189s">Don't</a>  say anything to the council people. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6387.531s">They're</a>  going to think you're out of your mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6389.394s">So</a>  I asked a couple of shop owners if this had been an apparent problem, and they said, you have no idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6395.638s">People</a>  have almost fallen coming out of our stores. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6398.359s">Look</a>  at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6398.819s">It</a>  goes all the way down to the car yards. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6401.461s">So</a>  it's from that Hubcap shop all the way down past Tony Giglio's shop, almost to the car bounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6408.305s">Take</a>  a walk, go look at them. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6410.046s">I</a>  think it's a real point for public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6412.367s">But</a>  the good point is, <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6413.828s">I</a>  really think that the T is responsible for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6416.469s">So</a>  it may not have to cost, you know, a big review of including something in the public works or the highway department budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6425.632s">So</a>  I'm just asking as a favor, if some people could really give us some serious pictures, go investigate it, and find out what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6433.635s">Hopefully</a>  the T, I think, is largely responsible for this, or trucks pulling up with heavy weight in front of stores. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6441.078s">Thank</a>  you for your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6442.923s">Have</a>  a safe 4th of July if I don't see you. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6445.405s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6446.085s">Thank</a>  you very much for coming up tonight, Sharon. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6448.227s">It's</a>  always a pleasure to see you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6564.655s">My</a>  name is Jason Berg. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6567.476s">I</a>  am with the owner of the noodles and company and the Panera Bread. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6573.599s">So</a>  I'll be part of all three of these. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6576.04s">Jeff</a>  Sarah is with the sign company who applied on my behalf. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6582.262s">In</a>  front of you, you have, you should have, <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6588.485s">We're</a>  talking about Panera first, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6590.506s">Yes,</a>  please. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6591.406s">So</a>  how's this? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6594.788s">See</a>  how good I am. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6601.111s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6604.433s">By</a>  right, we are allowed two building signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6607.494s">And</a>  with the way the building, I think you're aware of the building that's going on Riverside Avenue in front of the stop and chop. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6615.898s">the</a>  same conversation for the Panera and for the noodles. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6619.22s">Obviously</a>  we're on both of the end caps and we would clearly have a sign on the front of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6625.885s">And</a>  then the question is, is where would the second or third sign go? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6629.107s">And</a>  with the large development behind us, we wanted to have signage back there and as well as on the side. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6635.731s">So</a>  people coming on Riverside Avenue either way. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6640.855s">Below</a>  you'll see all the different signs that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6644.214s">With</a>  the drive-through signs, there's a menu panel. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6646.296s">I</a>  mean, we're talking about excessive signs because there's a menu panel, there's a preview panel, there's directional signs to guide people through the parking lot so they go the correct way. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6658.589s">So</a>  that's why I'm here.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6668.072s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6669.573s">Thank</a>  you, President Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6671.674s">On</a>  the second board, I'm sorry, and we have it in our packet that you had given us, is the three signs lined up. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6680.58s">Now,</a>  obviously, the middle one is the side, because you have the little drive-through window.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6685.944s">Yes,</a>  that's correct.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6687.205s">Which</a>  one is the back? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6688.085s">Which</a>  one is facing Riverside Ave, the top or the bottom? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6692.008s">Can</a>  you just describe which location?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6693.869s">I</a>  can tell you for on this one, the bottom is the front. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6697.051s">OK,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6700.357s">You</a>  could see with all the glass windows.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6702.638s">Where</a>  does it face? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6703.439s">I'm</a>  sorry? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6705.059s">Where</a>  does it face?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6706.4s">It</a>  faces Riverside Avenue.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6710.122s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6710.982s">Sorry.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6712.143s">Last</a>  question. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6714.524s">I</a>  noticed you have the smaller signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6719.487s">Do</a>  not enter. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6720.127s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6720.767s">I</a>  believe we put a requirement that there had to be a sign that says, do not queue beyond this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6728.011s">Did</a>  we?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6730.738s">I'm</a>  sorry, could you repeat that, Madam Vice President?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6733.86s">Oh,</a>  that was a Panera. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6735.782s">Ed,</a>  maybe through the city clerk, I don't know if you have the paper of their common victuals license. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6741.306s">We</a>  put a recommendation or a requirement that they had to put some sort of sign with regards to not queuing beyond a certain point to block the egress.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6752.293s">For</a>  the common vituals hearing that I was here for with the Panera, the only conversation was around the exhaust, exactly.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6760.547s">There</a>  was conversation around the exhaust, yes, but I believe we had a paper in there requiring do not queue beyond this point.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6768.272s">Councilor</a>  Knight's good with the minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6769.633s">I</a>  don't believe that was it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6770.794s">I</a>  think it was drawn out in a way that it was impossible. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6773.936s">The</a>  major issue we dealt with is the major issue that we dealt with on that was the issue of what was going on in Riverside Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6784.182s">And</a>  we had requested that the traffic commission put a <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6787.549s">blocks</a>  in that indicated one should not block the grid.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6792.99s">I</a>  know when the landlord did come in front of you to have conversations, it has been redesigned since then to what it is currently.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6801.533s">I</a>  would just add, if we, I'm going to have to go pull the minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6805.754s">Talk</a>  about for the drive-through, because there was only a certain amount of cue spots. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6809.135s">I</a>  remember specifically, you know, having a problem with it, but wanting to allow the drive-through. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6814.949s">I</a>  just have a problem with them blocking the, there's going to be an entrance at the end of the drive-thru, blocking parking, blocking the entrance and exit. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6823.492s">So</a>  we're specifically at 90% call requiring a sign that says do not queue beyond this point.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6833.776s">If</a>  it's on the drive-thru, which is a special permit, that condition will show up if it's already on there.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6844.031s">Yeah,</a>  can we check that? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6846.132s">We</a>  don't have that here?</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6848.092s">No,</a>  I mean, you'd have to go back to maybe the records. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6850.313s">It's</a>  like December 9, 2015 is the record we're looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6853.334s">We</a>  don't have it, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6854.234s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6855.515s">I'll</a>  try to look for it, and then if anybody else has a comment.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6857.595s">But</a>  if it's a, you can make the condition on the zoning, so if it's part of, I mean, the drive-through is a special permit, so if it shows that we'll be on there, the condition on this application, I'm not sure you can do it.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6873.058s">I</a>  don't know if anybody else has any questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6878.082s">I'll</a>  yield for right now.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6881.444s">I</a>  think I have the minutes, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6897.895s">What</a>  freestanding center are you referring to? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6900.72s">So</a>  there's a freestanding sign that's there currently for the entire development. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6905.105s">That's</a>  existing. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6906.766s">There</a>  is not another one that's going in. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6908.308s">Unless</a>  we're looking at something.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6912.773s">So</a>  what's this on board elevation here then? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6915.576s">It</a>  says preview board elevation.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6919.533s">OK,</a>  I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6920.373s">OK,</a>  I see what you're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6921.694s">That's</a>  part of the drive-through. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6922.895s">So</a>  in the back of the building, there will be a menu board. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6926.278s">So</a>  as you're coming through, as you're driving through as a guest, you're going to come to a clearance bar. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6932.343s">Then</a>  there'll be a preview board. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6934.304s">And</a>  then there'll be the menu board and a speaker canopy all together. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6938.067s">And</a>  then you'll turn the corner to the drive-through. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6942.611s">These</a>  are actually all on the site plan that you have previously approved behind the building.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6949.297s">So</a>  what constitutes assignment? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6951.278s">This</a>  would not be assigned. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6952.278s">This</a>  is part of the bottom large letter.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6953.959s">So</a>  it does have that on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6956.339s">Specifically,</a>  I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6957.44s">That's</a>  why we gave you everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6958.98s">That's</a>  why we're just showing you everything here.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6963.122s">Mr.</a>  President, I don't know if Council and I found it, but I was able to.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6968.664s">We</a>  sent them in the back room to meet with the residents, if you recall. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6971.805s">And</a>  then they came out, and they reached some sort of agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6975.926s">But</a>  I have not found it, to make the answer short.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6981.258s">Mr.</a>  President, I know this gentleman's here for the signage, but the residents in the area, particularly in fourth street and on Riverside have very concerned with the dirt mounds at the location. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=6996.424s">Uh,</a>  the excavating has been done for quite some time and residents were told by a meeting they had in the neighborhood, I think it was last week or the prior week that, uh, that dirt was going to be counted off site. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7010.195s">And</a>  now we're having a major storm tonight that's going to blow around a lot of dirt and debris. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7016.582s">And</a>  what's taking so long to remove a giant mound of dirt?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7021.486s">I</a>  have absolutely no idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7023.088s">So</a>  I am not with the landlord. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7025.37s">I</a>  am with the tenant fit out. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7026.732s">So</a>  once the landlord develops the building, then we'll come in and do the fit out of the actual restaurant itself or the restaurants. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7034.448s">I</a>  did speak with Mike Luongo of 4th Street yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7039.89s">It</a>  had to be yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7041.191s">I</a>  spoke with him yesterday, and he expressed his concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7043.852s">Actually,</a>  I also spoke with Carol McLaughlin yesterday morning on St. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7049.534s">James.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7051.194s">She</a>  also expressed her concern, and I mentioned it in an email to the landowner, the developer.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7057.737s">Mr.</a>  President, can we send a letter to the landlord developer <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7061.698s">and</a>  developer asking that the dirt, which has to be about 15 to 18 feet high, the length of the property, be removed.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7071.905s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, do you have that? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7073.306s">The</a>  landlord received a letter from the city council requesting that the immediate removal from the wall of dirt that seems to be plaguing the neighborhood and is such a concern for the neighbors.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7093.025s">I'll</a>  also inform him this evening.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7094.626s">Please.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7099.249s">How</a>  is our archival search proceeding?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7101.39s">Not</a>  so hot. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7104.512s">I'd</a>  move for approval, Mr. President, based on the contingency that if there are any restrictions on the permit, that they remain in effect when we approve the convict.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7115.959s">So</a>  on that motion, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7117.76s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7119.401s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7123.934s">Next,</a>  we have 554. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7129.696s">Petition</a>  for reversal of signed denial by Jeffrey Sauer of Batten Brothers for Noodles & Company, 491 Riverside Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7136.9s">Measured</a>  Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7137.58s">OCD</a>  application 2015-11-D. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7141.121s">Only</a>  one secondary allowed.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7143.663s">Mr.</a>  Noodle. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7147.804s">Same</a>  story, different address, and minus a drive-thru. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7155.612s">I</a>  really don't have anything different to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7156.874s">I</a>  mean, it's the same story we would have. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7158.016s">We're</a>  requesting three signs, the front, the rear, and on the side. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7162.843s">I</a>  don't know if I mentioned before, but I did speak with Mike Luongo and Carol McLaughlin yesterday about this specifically, and I assured them that it's not something that there's going to be a light that's projecting into you. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7172.526s">It's</a>  really just lighting up the sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7174.567s">There's</a>  no projection, so it's just there.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7178.088s">And</a>  a lot of the signage is conformity with requirements of the franchisee meets a national standard for the brand.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7187.832s">That</a>  is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7188.392s">Panera</a>  and noodles, that's exactly correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7190.132s">It's</a>  actually smaller than the other one, it looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7194.177s">Councilman</a>  Marks, you had something.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7195.358s">Well,</a>  I was just wondering, are you saying that both these companies require three primary signs?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7202.544s">No,</a>  that's not what I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7204.566s">Maybe</a>  I'm not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7206.467s">What</a>  question I answered was, are these signs typical signage for the brands? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7211.792s">That's</a>  what I heard you say, and that's what I was answering. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7214.634s">As</a>  far as size, is that what you're asking?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7216.816s">Well,</a>  I mean, you're requesting three signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7219.318s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7219.898s">And</a>  if they're typical brand signs, that's one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7224.093s">But</a>  to state that there are three signs that would be required by any business or company, I don't understand that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7236.376s">No,</a>  that's not what I was intending to say.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7239.576s">And</a>  if I could interject here, that's not what I was indicating. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7242.877s">Just</a>  that there was a standard of size as far as type and style. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7247.818s">That</a>  is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7251.558s">It</a>  has to be reflective of the logo and meet a standard of the franchise holder. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7256.701s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7257.202s">That</a>  is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7258.523s">So</a>  Panera has particular colors, but whatever they are, they can't be purple and yellow because that's not their brand. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7266.187s">That's</a>  correct.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7268.089s">That's</a>  correct.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7273.752s">What</a>  are the hours the light's going to be on? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7275.113s">They're</a>  going to be on from?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7277.395s">The</a>  lights are going to be on from dusk till dawn.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7278.956s">Dusk</a>  till dawn.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7281.748s">They're</a>  on a photo cell. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7287.553s">And</a>  I apologize, I neglected to mention this. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7291.517s">On</a>  the Panera, going back to the Panera, there was one sign that is in your drawings and shown, but it wasn't specifically mentioned, is on the front of the building, there's a small drive-through oval. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7307.472s">on</a>  the left side as you're facing the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7309.733s">It's</a>  been everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7310.794s">It</a>  just, for some reason, was not added as part of the signage. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7314.496s">So</a>  I just want to be clear about that.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7316.758s">So</a>  the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7321.501s">Do</a>  we have a motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7325.083s">Motion</a>  for approval from Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7327.063s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7328.184s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7328.764s">Opposed?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7329.364s">Motion</a>  carries. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7330.884s">Congratulations</a>  on the sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7332.325s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7474.655s">Your</a>  other Panera stores don't open at this hour?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7477.175s">We</a>  don't have many drive-thrus, and we believe that's what's going to drive this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7481.456s">I</a>  shouldn't say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7482.317s">We</a>  don't have that many drive-thrus in the Massachusetts area, and the ones that do are—we'd like to be open that early. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7493.939s">Approximately</a>  two months ago, I met with Tony and Sandy's civil <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7497.475s">I'm</a>  going to get this one wrong, sorry, Civita Riali. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7502.096s">Michael</a>  and Lorraine Luongo and Carol and John McLaughlin, and we spoke about this specifically. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7508.418s">And</a>  among other things around liquor for the noodles and as well as packets.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7513.54s">And</a>  what did they say about this?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7514.96s">And</a>  they all were, they all said they would have no problem with this.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7528.43s">That's</a>  two months ago compared to now. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7530.672s">You</a>  understand, as Councilor Marks just alluded to, that mound of dirt has caused a tremendous amount of problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7536.416s">There's</a>  a lady who lives across the street.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7540.059s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7541.88s">The</a>  dirt was addressed by the due diligence of Councilor Marks already.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7547.384s">The</a>  fact of the matter is that that mound of dirt has caused a tremendous amount of consternation over there, not only to the <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7552.832s">lady</a>  across the street, but it's found itself over the St. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7555.094s">James</a>  road and fourth street. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7556.756s">Um,</a>  and since all the neighbors are not in agreement of this, and I just can't understand why, you know, you don't have any drive-thrus, it's, it's, it's bad enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7564.625s">It's</a>  going to be huge, major congestion over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7567.348s">The</a>  neighbors, nobody's, nobody's going to get a benefit out of this except noodles. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7570.871s">And</a>  you know, everyone else has to conform to regular hours of operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7574.738s">I</a>  don't see any need right now yet for this, so I would not be voting for approval at this time for this.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7580.54s">Mr.</a>  President? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7581.62s">Councilor</a>  Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7582.601s">Well,</a>  I look at this a little bit differently than Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7586.362s">The</a>  need for this isn't just the business, it's the consumer. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7589.543s">It's</a>  the consumer. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7590.623s">If</a>  you go 10, 15 feet right next to this new development, you have Dunkin' Donuts that opens at 5 a.m., and they also have the business right behind it that is cooking all night long. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7600.367s">So</a>  in today's day and age, I know the council has been here for a long time, <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7604.485s">drive-through</a>  is a fairly new thing but people actually drive right by Dunkin Donuts in other parts of the community to go to a drive-through similar to the bank I know more people that drive right by Brookline Bank down in Medford Square or in West Medford <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7617.193s">to</a>  go to the drive-through because they have children in the back seat. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7620.055s">So</a>  just to be with today's day and age, I don't have any problem with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7624.939s">I</a>  think it's good for the consumer. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7627.261s">And</a>  quite honestly, if they don't have the demand and it's not the consumers that are using it, then they're going to push the hours back, I'm sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7633.345s">So</a>  this is going to be consumer-driven. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7635.647s">And</a>  this is why this is something that is a good, positive thing for economic development. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7640.811s">This</a>  is not something that was around in the 70s or in the 80s, but today in 2015, <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7646.842s">This</a>  is something that people look for, and this is something that I think I do support, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7653.486s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7654.047s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7655.848s">Mr.</a>  President, I find the paperwork in order, and I move for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7658.289s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7659.09s">A</a>  motion for approval, seconded by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7663.673s">On</a>  that motion for approval, Vice President Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7667.575s">Thank</a>  you, President De La Ruzo. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7669.036s">I'd</a>  like to put a review on this, if we could have, whether it be three or six. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7676.16s">month</a>  review and a one-year review so that we have the right to obviously withdraw the permission to open 5-7, that way we can see how it's going, see what response we get from the neighbourhood, see if everything's going smoothly. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7692.652s">I</a>  think I'd like to amend the paper as such.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7696.595s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7697.055s">So</a>  on the motion for approval by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Camuso, amended <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7706.868s">Vice</a>  President Ludlow-Kern to require a three or six-month review?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7714.431s">Six</a>  months and a 12-month review.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7716.771s">Six</a>  and a 12-month review on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7720.253s">Can</a>  I ask what that means specifically? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7722.473s">So</a>  that in six months, you're required to appear back before the council once you've opened and operated with the drive-through, and then the councillors will review the petition, <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7737.007s">And</a>  based upon any feedback we get from neighbors, consumers, et cetera, if there is any problems with this, the license permission to have the extended hours of operation will be withdrawn. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7753.034s">And</a>  that will also be done in the subsequent six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7756.675s">And</a>  then oftentimes within those periods of time, any issues can be resolved in that review. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7764.803s">Or</a>  if a teen seems to be a chronic issue, then the Councilors may feel that it's not appropriate to have a drive-through from 5 to 7.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7776.318s">Let</a>  me just say, which also may help this a little bit, so we have people there at 4 o'clock in the morning, whether we're open at 5 o'clock or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7784.765s">If</a>  we're open at 5 o'clock or 7 o'clock, we're there at 4 o'clock preparing for the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7789.77s">That's</a>  another big reason why we're open. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7792.152s">We</a>  don't expect from 5 to 6 or 6 to 7 to be open. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7796.723s">you</a>  know, all of a sudden an influx. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7798.143s">It's</a>  the, you know, the big grocers are open 24 hours because they're there 24 hours and there's not a large increased cost to be open those hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7808.106s">So</a>  it's, I don't think, I'm confident that when we come back in six months and come back in 12 months, you will have no complaints and it will be quick and painless.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7818.769s">We've</a>  not had any significant issue on any of the other operative drive-throughs. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7824.441s">in</a>  the city that we've been made aware of. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7827.742s">And</a>  we certainly don't want you to feel as though you're being put in a position here. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7835.203s">But</a>  we are clear about one thing, and that's we're concerned for the neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7840.545s">We're</a>  concerned about matters of traffic and for people's safety in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7846.866s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7848.606s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7850.307s">You</a>  alluded to outdoor seating. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7852.447s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7852.847s">Can</a>  you elaborate a little more on what the plans are?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7857.13s">They're</a>  in my car, because it's not on tonight's agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7860.592s">But</a>  we have, for the Panera and for the noodles, we're trying to get on tonight's meeting, but we'll be in hopefully your next meeting or hearing for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7870.658s">In</a>  the noodles, because there will be liquor, there is a, and I shouldn't say liquor, there's a beer and wine. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7875.861s">There's</a>  no hard alcohol. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7879.596s">But</a>  there is a gated patio that can only be entered in from the interior of the restaurant. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7884.6s">There</a>  is a gate with an alarm on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7886.742s">So</a>  if there's an emergency, people can leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7889.804s">But</a>  the alarm will go off. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7890.945s">So</a>  it's contained appropriately. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7895.749s">There's</a>  approximately 16, I believe there's 16 seats in that, on the noodle side, ADA compliant pathways. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7908.58s">and</a>  so on. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7909.781s">The</a>  Panera is not gated, there is no alcohol, and it's, I can't tell you the number of seats, I don't know off the top of my head, but they're on the sidewalk in front of the restaurant.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7922.231s">On</a>  the sidewalk, so with the noodles, you have to enter the restaurant in order to get to the outdoor patio.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7928.075s">That</a>  is correct, it's on the side of the building, it's on, well, on the side.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7933.119s">Now,</a>  did that always exist? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7935.501s">I</a>  don't ever recall outdoor seating when, <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7938.827s">this</a>  concept came up originally. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7940.748s">Was</a>  that always part of the plan?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7943.11s">I</a>  can't tell you what was presented to you originally. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7946.472s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7947.573s">It's</a>  always been in our plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7950.995s">It's</a>  always been in our plans to the landlord. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7954.738s">I</a>  can't tell you what, I don't know what they presented to you initially.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7958.02s">And</a>  when you talk about noodles, the seating will be on a sidewalk that is around the perimeter of the building.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7966.458s">It's</a>  on the side of the building, correct, on the Noodle side of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7969.259s">I</a>  don't know my north-south.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7970.819s">I'm</a>  talking about Panera now.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7972.5s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7972.64s">Now,</a>  the Panera will be on the front of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7975.181s">And</a>  they're still, where they're located, it still maintains egress. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7980.363s">So</a>  the tables that are on the closest to the drive lane have umbrellas, which have a 150-pound base. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7988.605s">So</a>  the tables can't easily be moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7990.966s">So</a>  that way, you're maintaining a walkway.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7995.312s">And</a>  how wide is that seating area?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7999.313s">Again,</a>  I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8000.053s">I</a>  wasn't planning to talk about this, so I can't tell you specifically. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8003.074s">But</a>  I can tell you that there's enough room for the tables and an appropriate code compliant walkway.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8010.016s">So</a>  you plan on being back before us within the next week or so?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8015.23s">I</a>  don't know when we're on, we've been working with Sheila in your office, in the clerk's office, so I don't know when, shortly is what I'll be able to tell you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8024.615s">I'll</a>  reserve my question until I come back.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8026.396s">Thank</a>  you, and for your information, as you're working with the officials here in Medford regarding outdoor seating, I'm sure they'll be informing you on whatever zoning and or Board of Health issues there are that you'll need to be compliant with.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8040.083s">Yes,</a>  yes.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8040.904s">So</a>  we have a motion for approval by President Camuso, <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8045.855s">seconded</a>  by President Camuso, by Councilor Knight, with the review amended, Councilor Camuso.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8050.956s">Thank</a>  you, and you brought up a very good point regarding a lot of the other establishments that have extended hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8058.058s">I</a>  would say the majority, well yes, at least two-thirds of this body, has supported extended hours and has been very economic development friendly when it comes to special permits, the majority of the Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8072.922s">With</a>  that being said, <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8074.778s">I</a>  don't recall one coming back to us for a show cause hearing on a special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8079.282s">The</a>  only show cause hearing I can remember in recent times was the pawn shop up on Boston Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8088.371s">So,</a>  I think this is a great economic development paper and I'd like to have a roll call vote on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8093.476s">Very</a>  good.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8094.817s">We</a>  have Councilor Penta requesting to speak on this.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8098.961s">Yeah,</a>  I'm just confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8101.182s">I'm</a>  really concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8101.963s">You're</a>  telling me you met with the neighbors and they said, okay, and I'm getting emails from them and they're saying no. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8107.928s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8108.388s">I,</a>  I, myself and the operator of the noodles and the operator of the Panera that are going to be there full time met with this, the three couples that I mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8119.878s">Um,</a>  I can't tell you the date off hand, but I can tell you it was at the Bertucci's. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8123.901s">Uh,</a>  we met in the back room. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8124.902s">We</a>  were there for approximately two hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8127.184s">And</a>  my last statement to the three couples was, <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8130.54s">Is</a>  there anything that is going to come up that I should know about? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8134.243s">I</a>  just want to make sure that I'm addressing every one of your concerns when it comes to conversations around a beer and wine license, regarding a patio, regarding opening early. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8144.611s">And</a>  I didn't know about the signs at that point, so we didn't have that conversation.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8151.055s">Councilor</a>  Cluso. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8151.836s">I</a>  think we're all aware of very, very nice people that live in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8156.78s">We</a>  all received the calls over the last few days. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8160.26s">And</a>  no one works harder to keep their neighborhood a great positive area to live in than the gentlemen that were just spoken about. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8171.008s">I</a>  am fully confident that with the reviews that they'll be happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8175.631s">And</a>  if not at that time, then we'll look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8177.972s">But</a>  let's look back to when this was A&W, when it was a pretty lighted area, this particular parcel, and it was vacant for <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8187.126s">three,</a>  four, five years to the point where people were coming to this honorable body complaining about the weeds and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8194.872s">So</a>  I just, I don't take lightly their phone calls and they're advocating for their neighborhood, but this is in the best interest of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8203.819s">And</a>  at some point within three or six or nine months down the road from the inception of it opening, if there's problems, we will deal with it appropriately.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8213.247s">And</a>  these couples all have my contact information, as well as the operators of each concept's contact information. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8220.232s">They've</a>  obviously reached out to me already when we talked about the signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8223.634s">So</a>  they know they can reach out.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8224.975s">There's</a>  obviously a time lapse, too, from you meeting with them a couple months ago to them calling all the members of the council over this weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8231.54s">So</a>  there's a time lapse. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8233.041s">And</a>  people do change. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8234.562s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8235.022s">And</a>  get after them about the dirt.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8238.224s">I</a>  will send them an email this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8240.005s">Please.</a> </p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8240.426s">Councilor</a>  Penton. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8241.416s">You</a>  all set?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8242.076s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8242.477s">I'm</a>  sorry.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8243.197s">I'm</a>  council angle. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8245.238s">Kern</a>  brings up a good point and I'm, this has got me confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8248.4s">All</a>  right, I'm going to tell you that they'll tell you one thing and I'm doing another. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8251.421s">I</a>  have no problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8252.382s">I'll</a>  vote for it, but I want to change it to a three month or six month in the year return three times within the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8258.265s">So</a>  let's see. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8260.286s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8260.546s">We'll</a>  just review it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8261.367s">Honestly,</a>  I'm, I'm not concerned.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8264.048s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8264.508s">I</a>  can tell you we're a, we are not a, we are not, <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8268.19s">a</a>  huge company or a family company.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8270.011s">That's</a>  fair enough, but I'm just saying, you have to understand, you know, when you get phone calls from neighbors and you get emails and it's contrary to what you're telling them.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8277.255s">I</a>  mean, I'm not going to call them.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8279.096s">So</a>  I don't know what happened from two months to now to have anyone change their mind if that's what they did. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8283.798s">But</a>  I could go along with a three month, a six month and a year.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8286.9s">So</a>  as amended by Councilor Penta, <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8289.135s">to</a>  make it a three, six, and 12-month review. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8293.759s">So</a>  on the motion for approval by Councilor Knight, as amended by Councilors Lungo-Koehn, and Penta, seconded by Camuso, we have a citizen who needs to talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8304.187s">Let</a>  me not forget him. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8305.578s">And</a>  we're going to let Councilor Marks talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8307.56s">Just</a>  a quick question, Mr. President, if I could.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8311.704s">The</a>  drive-thru. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8312.425s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8313.887s">If</a>  I want to get one of your egg and cheese sandwiches in the morning, can I use the drive-thru? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8318.892s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8319.913s">These</a>  are all pre-made, pre-prepared? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8321.595s">Nope.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8323.196s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8327.434s">It's</a>  interesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8328.775s">I</a>  wasn't a believer until I saw it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8330.896s">So</a>  actually, the speed of service is extremely important, and it's actually faster when you go through a drive-through of a Panera than when you come into the inside. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8339.162s">So</a>  without giving you a three-hour explanation, the short story is when you come into the restaurant, we could have four, five, or six cash registers, and they're all going to one preparation area. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8350.631s">So</a>  you could have six orders at once coming to this preparation area. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8353.573s">In</a>  the drive-through, you have one preparation area and one person taking the order. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8359.256s">And</a>  when you're placing the order, turkey sandwich, whatever, egg and cheese, whatever, the person that makes the sandwiches has a headset and hears it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8368.062s">So</a>  they're starting to make it while you're talking about it.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8371.784s">So</a>  you don't foresee any backup in that particular area if people come down and order sandwiches</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8377.499s">No,</a>  because everything is made fresh. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8379.76s">So</a>  there is nothing pre-made. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8382.621s">There</a>  is nothing frozen. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8383.702s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8387.684s">Could</a>  we run out of bread? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8388.984s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8389.985s">Could</a>  we run out of something? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8391.185s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8392.366s">But</a>  to be a norm, absolutely not. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8394.967s">It's</a>  all fresh, made every day.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8396.768s">I'm</a>  not disputing whether it's fresh or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8399.089s">I'm</a>  disputing how long it would take to get through your line if you ordered something other than a cup of coffee. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8404.331s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8407.167s">Do</a>  you know what your average wait time is?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8411.609s">Not</a>  this second. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8414.95s">Not</a>  this second, but it's, it's, I don't know off the top of my head.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8417.871s">Mr.</a>  President, the reason why I ask is, uh, you know, I don't want to name any particular establishments, but there's a drive through in Wellington that when you go through the drive through, they ask you to pull into the parking lot and be seated in a parking spot while they're making your food. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8432.517s">And</a>  then they come out and, <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8433.753s">and</a>  deliver your food, which to me defeats the whole purpose of a drive-thru.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8437.114s">So</a>  as our franchise, we have eight Panera Breads with drive-thrus currently. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8442.997s">None</a>  of them have parking stalls, as you're, whatever you want to call them, pull ahead and wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8447.479s">And</a>  I don't know a time that I've ever seen that occur.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8451.68s">So</a>  you don't anticipate that at Panera?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8454.481s">If</a>  we can't produce it quickly, we will be out of the drive-thru business. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8459.483s">So</a>  with all due respect, it's really more of my concern than your concern.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8464.373s">I</a>  don't want to wait in line either, so.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8467.195s">We</a>  have a motion for approval on the floor.</p>

    <p>[Robert Cappucci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8470.477s">As</a>  amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8471.377s">Mr.</a>  Citizen, would you speak, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8473.879s">Senator?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8474.539s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8475.78s">I'll</a>  be very brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8476.76s">I'm</a>  Robert Capucci, 71 Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8481.303s">My</a>  concern is that with more traffic on the road, that somehow if you could expedite whatever projects you have in the works to fix the roads that are in dire need of repair and <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8494.429s">When</a>  drive-throughs have existed in this country for decades, and when one city councilor makes a personal attack on another city councilor's age, but he said it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8509.253s">It's</a>  an affront to every senior citizen.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8514.034s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8516.835s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Camuso.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8519.516s">Just</a>  to clear the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8521.052s">I</a>  stand by my comments, and I was talking about Councilor Penta's 30-plus years of service, and the drive-throughs are fairly new. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8527.415s">He's</a>  been around here for 30 years.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8528.956s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8530.397s">Ma'am,</a>  please state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8534.719s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Jeanne Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8537.66s">Jean</a>  Martin, 10 Cumming Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8539.681s">And</a>  I— Ms.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8544.304s">Martin.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jeanne Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8546.462s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8549.203s">I</a>  am pro this business. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8551.164s">I</a>  live in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8552.525s">I</a>  do take your concern about parking in the backup, but I'm really loving the idea of the Panera Bread. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8559.405s">because</a>  it's a gathering place. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8560.966s">It's</a>  a place, because I love the Wellington Circle Plaza, what it's turned into. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8566.369s">I</a>  know I never comment well on our business districts, but that's one really nice one. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8571.732s">They</a>  really did a beautiful job. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8574.474s">What</a>  it is missing is a restaurant area where people can come together, gather, and eat. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8580.957s">I</a>  love the Stop and Shop and all those places, and the sports store and Models and all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8586.38s">Fantastic.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8587.641s">They</a>  do, on the other side of Wellington, <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8589.733s">have</a>  the burrito place and a couple of others. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8592.414s">So</a>  this is a nice compliment to the burrito place, and I'm pro it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8596.777s">And</a>  I do remember when it was Happy Hattic, and it was a bustling place when it was Happy Hattic for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8601.92s">But</a>  it did go, Happy Hattic went out, and then it was an empty spot for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8607.723s">Back</a>  to the concern about traffic, and Mr. Marks always talks about this, traffic calming measures need to be thought through. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8615.807s">This</a>  doesn't have anything to do with this gentleman here. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8620.122s">When</a>  you come up to Wellington Circle, it's supposed to be technically one lane. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8624.785s">We</a>  all know they stack three, and then the person takes the right. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8628.307s">There's</a>  two lanes without a line down it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8631.569s">It's</a>  very dangerous. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8632.83s">My</a>  cousin got in an accident. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8633.991s">She</a>  had to pay for the accident because the insurance company said, well, it was one lane, and you were to the right of that, and you technically weren't. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8644.477s">So</a>  it becomes an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8646.319s">So</a>  the backing up is definitely an issue, so I'm all for. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8650.405s">also</a>  the three-month, six-month, or nine-month review. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8652.947s">I</a>  have no problem with that because the backup of the cars can be a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8658.913s">But</a>  part of that is on the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8661.175s">We</a>  need to make sure that the traffic pattern at that intersection is also squared away with proper markings, whatever you have to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8670.102s">But</a>  I am definitely for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8671.444s">This</a>  is a clean business. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8672.825s">It's</a>  a gathering place. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8674.648s">It's</a>  awesome. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8675.188s">It's</a>  great for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8675.908s">It's</a>  great for Wellington. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8677.109s">So,</a>  I know I always tear down the business districts, but this is a good one and it's not overdeveloped. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8683.39s">Whoa,</a>  I said something positive about the businesses.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8685.931s">Hey.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8686.471s">On</a>  the motion for approval by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Camuso, as amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8690.492s">All</a>  those in favour? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8692.032s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8692.793s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8694.113s">Congratulations.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8694.973s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8695.413s">Can</a>  I ask one question?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8696.193s">Motions,</a>  orders and resolutions.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8697.974s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8698.627s">just</a>  about the three, six, nine, three, six, 12 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8701.568s">Is</a>  that automatically going to be scheduled? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8703.308s">Do</a>  I need to appear?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8704.428s">Yes,</a>  it's from your, uh, uh, Dave operation.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8707.849s">So</a>  I'll just work with the city clerk's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8709.429s">Please</a>  do. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8710.109s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8711.23s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8713.61s">15</a>  five 50 offered by council night. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8715.41s">Be</a>  it resolved that the Medford city council extended steep and sincere condolences to the family of Paul Cavanaugh senior on his recent passing. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8724.213s">And</a>  while we have this, we have another condolence offered by Councilor Penta that a moment of silence be offered for the passing of former Medford Police Detective John P. Brady. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8736.536s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8738.336s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8740.577s">Over</a>  the last couple of years, I've become very friendly with Paul Cavanaugh Jr. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8744.058s">He</a>  recently lost his father. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8746.223s">I</a>  was unable to make the services last week, however, I did want to extend my deep and sincere condolences to he and his family in their loss, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8753.568s">And</a>  I'd ask my council colleagues to do the same.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8755.79s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8756.59s">I</a>  was negligent and forgot to mention also, but I offered by Councilor Caraviello, condolences to the family of Arlene O'Neill. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8766.957s">Arlene</a>  is the mother of Ed O'Neill, City's solicitor, City Assessor. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8772.821s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8773.882s">Councilor</a>  Penta, <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8776.424s">Inspector</a>  Brady.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8778.245s">Mr.</a>  Brady, he retired, I believe, as a lieutenant detective in the Medford Police Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8783.649s">He</a>  served many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8786.23s">He</a>  was a detective. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8790.773s">And</a>  he served this community well. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8792.795s">He</a>  worked with the FBI. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8793.755s">He</a>  worked with the state police. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8794.776s">He</a>  was well recognized for his duty as a Medford police officer in bringing good name and recognition to our community and to his family. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8804.805s">His</a>  daughter was a former school committeeman, Hattie Brady. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8808.367s">And</a>  to his wife, Mary, and to the rest of the family, I wish them a special, special notice.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8815.932s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8818.033s">Yes,</a>  Inspector Brady, very well respected in the Medford Police Department, but also throughout the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in his rank as detective. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8829.64s">He</a>  certainly made Medford proud, but he also <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8833.064s">did</a>  a lot after his retirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8834.585s">He</a>  was doing private investigative work, and he was often called upon by law enforcement agencies, still, even in retirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8842.972s">So</a>  I want to send our condolences to him and his family, and his son-in-law, Chris, who worked in this building for many, many years, up until about three or four months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8854.121s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Joe Viglione]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8980.742s">Thank</a>  you, Council President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8982.043s">Joe</a>  Viglione, 59 Garfield Avenue, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8985.385s">16</a>  years ago tomorrow, <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8987.493s">As</a>  a member of TV3 Medford, I had borrowed a camera and taped my wonderful Nana on her 100th birthday. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8994.955s">And</a>  my dad, who was her son-in-law, worked with the woman from the Somerville Journal. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8999.856s">I</a>  videotaped. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9002.017s">And</a>  Nana told her story of coming to America. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9004.737s">She</a>  had a little broken English, which was charming, and so that's why dad would help out his mother-in-law. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9009.979s">And</a>  we have this one-hour video, and it's just beautiful. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9012.499s">And</a>  I also did a cooking show with Nana up in Woburn. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9016.904s">And</a>  the cooking show was lovely because she'd bake her pizzellas and that's what public access is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9026.308s">But</a>  all seven of you Councilors, or six, and Mr. Caraviello, you all need public access TV. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9036.191s">You</a>  all need it beyond cooking with grandma, the sports, <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9042.992s">the</a>  musicals at the Chevalier, and the wonderful things that Access can provide. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9047.655s">Now,</a>  I spoke, I told Mayor McGlynn last week when I saw him, Your Honor, I can put this together in my sleep. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9055.221s">And</a>  I saw Louise Miller. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9056.482s">She's</a>  a wonderful woman. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9057.783s">And</a>  I said to Louise, she's about 20 grand. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9060.625s">We</a>  could have a little van. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9062.246s">And</a>  here is my plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9064.748s">We</a>  can have a van, a mobile van, to take political events and air them to Comcast Channel 3 and on Verizon. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9072.088s">You</a>  can do it via cellular, so we do not need to have a station right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9076.151s">The</a>  city can own the station temporarily. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9079.633s">So</a>  the city can allow us to either put a temporary non-profit together or the city of Medford could authorize cable as other cities and towns have done. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9088.68s">With</a>  a backpack, which costs approximately $7,000, we could go to the political events. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9095.584s">And</a>  there have been so many new school committee members having political events. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9101.535s">That</a>  should be taped. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9103.096s">The</a>  woman from the Lions Club tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9104.876s">I</a>  know she would love to have her events taped. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9108.037s">It's</a>  not happening in Medford, yet it happens in Somerville and everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9111.139s">This</a>  is an emergency, and paying as much as we pay for each councilor, all seven of you should be really saying to the mayor, we know you're the issuing authority, but this is our issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9121.022s">The</a>  constituents need this. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9123.823s">The</a>  election season needs this. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9127.825s">Now,</a>  the library, <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9130.225s">The</a>  library has a little bit of space, a temporary place at the library, and let's lend them some money. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9139.368s">Mr.</a>  Council President, can I wait until the person's finished because the noise is kind of disrupting me? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9144.97s">May</a>  I take a moment? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9149.031s">May</a>  I take a moment because I'm being disturbed by one of the councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9151.772s">He's</a>  busy.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9156.22s">The</a>  same topic's been discussed within the last 90 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9158.401s">I'd</a>  like a ruling as to whether or not the paper's out of order.</p>

    <p>[Joe Viglione]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9162.683s">Again,</a>  this is a critical time. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9164.504s">This</a>  is an election. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9165.785s">And</a>  Paul Donato, State Rep. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9167.486s">Paul</a>  Donato. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9167.966s">He's</a>  not here right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9168.486s">I</a>  saw him here with Susan Crowley on Friday night with Mari Carroll, and I'll quote the great Rep. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9173.969s">Donato</a>  who said, it is the most protected right. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9176.711s">So</a>  if he wants to strip away my First Amendment rights as <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9179.743s">as</a>  was done to Robert Cappucci earlier tonight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9181.665s">Mr.</a>  President, I'm pretty sure that the Constitution of the United States of America does not say that you can come to a meeting and speak about whatever you want whenever you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9188.51s">No</a>  one's impeding this gentleman from his freedom of speech.</p>

    <p>[Joe Viglione]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9192.173s">You</a>  can stand on the front stairs and scream all you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9195.495s">If</a>  he's going to speak to the public, he should learn how to speak slowly and articulately.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9200.419s">Mr.</a>  President, I made a motion to have the ruling on the paper.</p>

    <p>[Joe Viglione]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9203.501s">I'm</a>  trying to get us access to TV, and this man voted for his own race and doesn't want to help the</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9211.732s">Sir,</a>  we're politely asking you to complete your remarks by staying on subject, and we're allowing you to continue.</p>

    <p>[Joe Viglione]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9222.415s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9223.175s">And</a>  I would appreciate no one interrupting me. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9226.556s">The</a>  Chevalier is reportedly wired for Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9229.177s">Now,</a>  they might have to upgrade it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9230.917s">So</a>  the Chevalier, the library, these are important. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9234.238s">And</a>  this is a very important reason why I'm speaking here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9237.986s">July</a>  3rd is when the contract with Comcast expires, which means, if the mayor signs it, we get a balloon payment of about $350,000 and, I believe, another $38,000 from Verizon. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9250.073s">This</a>  is significant. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9251.513s">This</a>  is significant, President de la Ruzo, and I appreciate you letting me speak on this because I don't think the public knows this balloon payment's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9259.018s">We</a>  can lend money to the Chevalier for air conditioning. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9261.719s">We</a>  can lend money to the library to help them out, and we can help this political season. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9267.436s">candidate</a>  out there, you call me up and I will try to help you get on television. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9271.079s">I</a>  have a camera, my own camera. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9273.661s">I</a>  bought it right off of eBay. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9275.402s">I</a>  have a camera. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9276.202s">I</a>  can go anywhere and no access station can tell me I can't be political because it's my camera. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9282.247s">Call</a>  me. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9282.947s">I</a>  will help you out.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9284.429s">Mr.</a>  President, as we're all gearing up for reelection, can we get this question answered as to the status of the station?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9294.523s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Camuso that the mayor report back to the city council on the status of the station. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9301.388s">Councilor</a>  Penter.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9302.708s">The</a>  question of June, July 3rd on the status of whether the mayor is going to sign a 10 year contract or not, unfortunately, um, I don't think should bode well with the rate payers here in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9316.458s">The</a>  mayor by design and choice did not pick a new director of public works. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9321.021s">He's</a>  leaving that for the next mayor to come on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9323.835s">in</a>  January of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9326.396s">That's</a>  just an 83,000, or strike that, it's about a $100,000 a year job. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9330.939s">This</a>  is a 10-year, multi-year contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9334.341s">This</a>  is a mega contract that this city will be signing with Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9338.103s">And</a>  Comcast, as we all know, this probably has one of the worst reputations for public employment of their employees throughout the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9347.95s">as</a>  they're being reviewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9348.97s">And</a>  I think you can just find that out on their public service. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9351.591s">But</a>  putting that aside and recognizing the fact that when the public hearing took place here regarding a public access cable in this community, I was the only one that represented, as an elected official, as any administrator, as the mayor, I was the only one that appeared here on behalf of the ratepayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9368.116s">And</a>  city government should have been here on behalf of the ratepayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9370.917s">They</a>  should have been on behalf here. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9372.518s">And</a>  they weren't. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9373.658s">And</a>  the sad part about this is whether you sign the 10-year contract or not, <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9377.323s">and</a>  you get that balloon payment, there's another $300,000 plus sitting downstairs as money that the mayor has held down here in escrow in the city's coffers. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9386.871s">So</a>  this goes back to December of 2013. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9388.872s">There's</a>  been no cable access here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9392.615s">This</a>  is an election year. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9393.596s">This</a>  will make two election cycles that the people have been denied an opportunity not only to see and hear their candidates. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9399.761s">I</a>  don't care who you're for or who you're against. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9401.752s">But</a>  that's what public access is about, plus any other community of interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9405.413s">You</a>  have sports, you have arts, you have culture. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9408.174s">There's</a>  a whole host of things that community access is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9411.355s">And</a>  this administration has intentionally denied that accessibility to take place here in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9417.437s">It</a>  is wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9418.717s">And</a>  I think what the gentleman at the podium was trying to say is, Mr. Mayor, you should just allow it, whether it's in a portable situation or make something temporary, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9427.26s">You</a>  know, we just went through a three-member committee who made a report. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9431.114s">that</a>  came back and, you know, the mayor told him he wanted to come out in February, wanted to report by Memorial Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9437.496s">Memorial</a>  Day has come and gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9439.016s">We're</a>  almost into the July season here right now, and there is still nothing, whether you agree or disagree with the recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9445.318s">And</a>  when the mayor wanted to put it up at the high school in the dead of night, where people would have to go there, where it would be dark and secluded, when the recommendation was to put it in an open downtown area, easily accessible to people, that's a shame. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9459.687s">But</a>  I think it was Councilor Caraviello and I think it was Mr. Viglione who mentioned the ideas of possibly going to Shavia, which is equipped to do it, or to put it in the second floor, or have a complete renovation with the friends of the Miffin Public Library and looking at its future use. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9475.983s">And</a>  that's what the discussion was about on the money that went back to the library that the mayor mysteriously found. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9482.468s">This</a>  is what it's all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9483.629s">This</a>  is what community needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9485.37s">They</a>  need not only this community access, they need this interaction. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9488.233s">They</a>  need this transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9490.034s">They</a>  need to know that their money is being spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9492.436s">Who</a>  in their right mind would believe that $300,000 of their cable money is sitting downstairs in this building, not getting any use, not even having any program, not even having any public input, not even coming and speaking in behalf of the ratepayers for which he is the issuing authority on.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9512.286s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9514.847s">The</a>  city was represented by legal counsel at the hearing, who specifically, that's his job, representing the city in a contract with cable providers. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9525.913s">So</a>  the city did have representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9528.694s">And</a>  from my understanding, there wasn't many people that participated in it, unfortunately.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9535.798s">Could</a>  you please repeat what you just said? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9537.279s">Who</a>  was the city representative? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9539.02s">The</a>  lawyer. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9540.105s">The</a>  lawyer gets paid $330 an hour to be here, to listen, to hear the hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9545.347s">He</a>  wasn't representing the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9546.907s">He</a>  was here to take the input of the people who were there at that meeting.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9551.108s">That's</a>  what his input was. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9551.969s">The</a>  counsel is incorrect. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9553.149s">He</a>  was here representing the city to get the input, to see what the people of Medford, that are cable rate payers, would like to see included in a successor agreement.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9562.372s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Miles. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9564.833s">I'm</a>  just wondering when this lawyer was elected by the people of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9568.794s">No,</a>  no. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9570.106s">You</a>  said he was represent.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9577.588s">Next</a>  time have a microphone on when you want.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9579.388s">I</a>  believe the gentleman was employed by the mayor as he was 10 years ago when they had a public hearing here. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9585.61s">And</a>  unbeknownst to anyone until the question was asked, the, the, um, the July 3rd date was as a result of two days ahead of time, the mayor having this conversation and asking for an extension to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9598.922s">When</a>  an ascertainment hearing took place at that meeting in May, and there was about 10 or 15 people here, but how do you have the hall filled with people when you have it at 2 o'clock in the afternoon and people are working? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9609.889s">That's</a>  number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9610.99s">When</a>  you have mostly senior citizens <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9612.81s">who</a>  came up here and dredged up here and to make the complaint about not only that, but having no senior citizen discount, not having an opportunity to have public access, not having an opportunity to have their money that's paid each and every month to go into a slush fund that's held downstairs, you might as well just give it back to the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9630.124s">If</a>  they're not getting used of cable access and they're being charged for it, how do you take that money and account for it and tell the people you're getting public access when you're not getting it? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9640.893s">That's</a>  not transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9642.656s">That's</a>  a shadow way of doing things. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9644.899s">I'm</a>  going to keep it in secrecy. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9646.621s">Well,</a>  what's the big secret here? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9648.424s">Are</a>  we or are we not going to have public access? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9650.867s">That's</a>  the bottom line. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9652.189s">And</a>  the mayor has refused intentionally to answer that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9655.94s">because</a>  he does not want public access on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9658.381s">Whether</a>  it praises him or criticize him, he doesn't want it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9661.802s">The</a>  only thing he has is Channel 15 that he's used exclusively for himself, which is a high school educational channel that everyone else in this room is excluded from using. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9672.126s">It's</a>  wrong.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9672.946s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9673.906s">Councilor</a>  Camuso.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9675.127s">Yes,</a>  I'm going to talk facts now. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9677.247s">The</a>  facts are the city of Medford put out a bid. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9679.628s">There</a>  was, I believe, one individual that put in a bid <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9685.157s">that</a>  currently doesn't have a corporation or a company. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9690.419s">And</a>  it's, I'm assuming, still under review. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9692.539s">The</a>  second piece of it is, we are getting a studio and it's going to be up at Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9698.521s">Up</a>  at Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9699.361s">Representative.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9700.942s">Point</a>  of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9701.482s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Panta. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9703.242s">Show</a>  us the document where that information is coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9705.723s">Because</a>  none of us in this room have a document that says a studio is going up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9710.504s">And</a>  how is it going to be funded and when is it going to begin?</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9713.439s">Mr.</a>  President, if I may continue talking facts, if I may continue talking facts, they did make an announcement with the director of the vocational school, Representative Donato, I believe Ann Marie Cunha was at the event, as well as Mayor McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9730.623s">Subsequent</a>  to that,</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9736.423s">picture</a>  that took place up there, that whole situation is now on hold. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9740.124s">There's</a>  absolutely nothing going on at the vocational school or the high school where it's going to put that studio up there.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9746.846s">Mr.</a>  President, they are working on the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9750.648s">I</a>  actually visited the area where they're putting it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9753.148s">And</a>  my question is, if we're going to have people go into that building, I want to make sure that they're corey cleared and taking precautions to protect our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9761.151s">And</a>  they're actually putting out they're putting out <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9765.821s">They</a>  may possibly put a door leading directly into the studio so that they don't have to traverse the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9771.726s">So</a>  like I said, I just wanted to bring a couple facts to the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9775.068s">And</a>  it's always good to ask the question, as I stated a little earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9779.251s">But</a>  also if we can get an update from Louise Miller on the one person that did put in for the bid. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9785.696s">It's</a>  some entity. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9788.26s">But</a>  I don't know much about the person or entity, so if we could get a report back on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9792.463s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9792.923s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Camuso, as amended by Councilor Camuso.</p>

    <p>[Joe Viglione]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9798.267s">Just</a>  one point of clarification, City Council President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9801.489s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9802.91s">The</a>  facts are incorrect for Mr. Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9804.971s">There</a>  is a business registered with the City of Medford called Community Media Medford, and it will become a corporation the minute the mayor gives the green light. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9812.756s">And</a>  I have the money to make it a corporation instantly. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9815.558s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9816.967s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9819.048s">If</a>  I may, are you the person that put in the bid? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9821.468s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9823.449s">This</a>  is news to me.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9825.049s">We'll</a>  get a clarification from the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9826.809s">So</a>  on the motion of council, Camuso for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9829.33s">All</a>  those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9830.85s">Did</a>  you know he put in for the bid?</p>

    <p>[Jeanne Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9836.152s">Me</a>  neither. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9839.352s">If</a>  this thing is going to take off, it needs community input. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9844.494s">It</a>  needs a lot of community input. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9846.923s">and</a>  the people need to come together because it is a resource. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9851.225s">Forget</a>  all the politics. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9853.367s">You</a>  can pressure the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9854.807s">The</a>  people, not you folks, the people can put pressure on the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9860.871s">Only</a>  if they band together, whether it be the arts community, the business community, a combination like I talked about, Cross Nova, and everybody getting together. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9871.397s">They</a>  need a good, strong 15 to 20 bodies. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9874.724s">with</a>  a lot of knowledge about nonprofits, a lot of knowledge about media, a lot of knowledge. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9878.727s">It</a>  can't be just one person. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9880.708s">It</a>  needs to be a body of people, about 15 to 20, very dedicated community people. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9885.551s">And</a>  15 to 20 people could change this whole conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9889.113s">If</a>  you got those people to show up at the mayor's office and said, we're ready, we want this to happen, it would happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9895.938s">He</a>  wouldn't have a choice if you had 15 people. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9898.92s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9901.642s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9902.082s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[acqgxK4yhEM_SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9904.555s">Mario</a>  Martin at 198 Harvard. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9907.076s">Really</a>  briefly, I just want to say that the fact that we're here assembling and using the democratic process to ask the administration to discontinue defunding local access is, in my opinion, personally, pretty ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9920.219s">As</a>  a constitutional watchdog that I am, this is unconstitutional. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9925.9s">Essentially,</a>  what's happening is my right to freedom of speech is basically being taken away. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9935.233s">Everyone</a>  knows I'm running for public office. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9938.514s">I</a>  need the ability to exercise my freedom to speak to my neighbors so I can get the message out to everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9950.68s">But</a>  let's just use logic for a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9953.481s">Let's</a>  just say the media blackout isn't about the administration trying to handicap thoroughly good Medford citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9961.724s">Why</a>  else are we here? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9965.99s">Why</a>  are we here? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9966.691s">Why</a>  is this even an issue? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9971.795s">Funding</a>  local access puts the word unity in community, and I'm in strong support of the immediate restoration of public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9982.604s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9986.467s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Camuso for approval, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9992.432s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9993.212s">The</a>  motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9996.299s">15556,</a>  communication from the mayor are revised on the motion of Councilor Camuso to table. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=10002.962s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=10003.863s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=10005.283s">Paper</a>  is tabled. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=10006.804s">The</a>  records of the last meeting of the Medford City Council were passed to Council on night, June 16, 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=10013.808s">Councilor,</a>  your recommendation, please.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=10016.269s">It's</a>  with great happiness that I would recommend that the minutes of last week's meeting be approved, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=10026.466s">and</a>  then on your motion for adjournment. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=10028.732s">I'll</a>  give you the motion for adjournment. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=10031.238s">Thank</a>  you, councillors.</p>
