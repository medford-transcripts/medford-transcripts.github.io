Thank you.

24
00:01:49,562 --> 00:01:58,646
Our first item is Walkley Court PDE for special permit for site plan review as well as special permit review.

25
00:01:59,046 --> 00:02:00,867
I will read the public hearing notice for it.

26
00:02:01,307 --> 00:02:04,589
The Method Community Development Board shall conduct a public hearing on February 7, 2016.

27
00:02:06,475 --> 00:02:08,156
24, after 6.30 p.m.

28
00:02:08,276 --> 00:02:12,539
via Zoom remote video conferencing relative to an application for site plan review.

29
00:02:13,079 --> 00:02:29,870
Submitted by the Medford Housing Authority for the demolition of all existing buildings on the site to be replaced by a mid-rise building with 198 apartments for elders and seniors and four buildings with 40 family units, 24 units in a low-rise building and 16 townhomes and three buildings.

30
00:02:30,798 --> 00:02:38,664
The CDB board will also hold a public meeting relative to the application for plan development permit, special permit for the same matter.

31
00:02:39,564 --> 00:02:50,152
A subsequent public hearing for the application of the plan development special permit on the same matter will be held by the Medford City Council on February 20th, 2024 at 7 p.m.

32
00:02:50,272 --> 00:02:55,275
in Medford City Council Chambers, which is located on the second floor of Medford City Hall.

33
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,438
Danielle, can you please introduce

34
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:03,496
Anyone from the Medford Housing Authority?

35
00:03:05,918 --> 00:03:09,702
They're a large team, so I'll let them introduce themselves, but I just want to...

36
00:03:11,734 --> 00:03:13,815
just provide a little context for the evening.

37
00:03:14,776 --> 00:03:41,030
So you may recall that back in the fall, Medford Housing Authority applied for a plan development district and that went through the process and that overlay was approved by city council in the fall and which essentially creates a different zoning that would allow the uses and the dimensions of the proposed project to be built

38
00:03:43,752 --> 00:03:49,957
However, there's the subsequent step, which is beginning tonight, which is to have their site plan approved.

39
00:03:50,718 --> 00:04:08,354
And they also need a special permit for a plan development special permit, where the city council is the special permit granting authority, but the Community Development Board will be issuing a recommendation on how they should vote for that.

40
00:04:15,052 --> 00:04:16,133
Thank you very much.

41
00:04:16,993 --> 00:04:24,198
And, uh, just to quickly clarify, uh, the approval of the zoning does not necessarily approve the project.

42
00:04:24,718 --> 00:04:28,140
That's what we will be doing our due diligence this evening along with the public.

43
00:04:28,821 --> 00:04:35,505
And in saying that I invite the Redford House or whoever the representative from Redford House Authority to please present.

44
00:04:42,229 --> 00:04:43,850
Mr. Cicerello.

45
00:04:45,397 --> 00:04:45,637
Hi.

46
00:04:47,539 --> 00:04:49,640
Oh, Daniel, can you please unmute?

47
00:04:52,362 --> 00:04:54,144
Yeah, I think we're clicking at the same time.

48
00:04:54,184 --> 00:04:56,105
So I clicked ask to unmute.

49
00:04:57,526 --> 00:04:58,467
So you should be able to unmute, yes.

50
00:04:58,487 --> 00:04:59,088
Thank you.

51
00:04:59,328 --> 00:05:05,152
And could we allow Maura Barry Gartland to pull up the presentation?

52
00:05:18,671 --> 00:05:21,613
I'm trying to, okay, Maura Berry Garland?

53
00:05:22,493 --> 00:05:22,793
Yes.

54
00:05:25,595 --> 00:05:28,256
Okay, I'll make her.

55
00:05:37,641 --> 00:05:38,602
Great, thank you.

56
00:05:40,383 --> 00:05:41,804
Can everyone see my screen?

57
00:05:45,506 --> 00:05:47,547
Perfect, yeah, I'll let Gabe begin.

58
00:05:50,006 --> 00:05:51,107
Okay, good evening everyone.

59
00:05:51,627 --> 00:05:52,989
My name's Gabe Ciccariello.

60
00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:57,313
I'm the director of modernization and procurement for the Medford Housing Authority.

61
00:05:57,834 --> 00:06:00,076
And thank you for meeting with us.

62
00:06:00,236 --> 00:06:07,744
We're here before you as was described to go through our site plan review and special permit presentation.

63
00:06:07,764 --> 00:06:09,746
If you want to go to the next slide.

64
00:06:14,945 --> 00:06:25,191
So, as I said, Gabe Ciccariello, Director of Modernization Procurement, and so we are the applicant and I also have with me this evening, Jeffrey Driscoll, who is our Executive Director.

65
00:06:26,071 --> 00:06:36,737
The Cambridge Housing Authority is assisting us as our development consultant and with Cambridge Housing Authority, we have Margaret Donnelly-Moran with us and Maura Barry-Gartland.

66
00:06:37,695 --> 00:06:45,320
And for our counsel, known she and patent is our counseling of Hannah Kilson, who will be assisting with the presentation.

67
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,921
And we also have Veronica.

68
00:06:50,097 --> 00:06:53,680
with Nolan Sheehan-Patton, and our architect is Dietz & Company Architects.

69
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:58,944
Lee Morissette is here, who's a principal architect, and Danny Gerber-Luticia.

70
00:06:59,684 --> 00:07:13,374
We also have our civil engineer, Fuston O'Neill, and Josue Valdez will be assisting us also with the presentation, and our traffic engineer was Niche Engineering, and Brian Zimolka will be doing a couple slides.

71
00:07:13,774 --> 00:07:19,619
So through this presentation, we'll start off with the current existing conditions of Walkman Corp.

72
00:07:20,688 --> 00:07:30,116
Then we're going to go through the neighborhood context, our goals and outreach during our feasibility and design process.

73
00:07:30,537 --> 00:07:41,346
We're going to go through the zoning table, the size and scale of the development, building layout, unit counts and lot usage, site access and traffic impact.

74
00:07:42,357 --> 00:07:51,164
landscape and trees, resiliency, sustainability, environmental issues, exterior facades, materials, and shadow studies.

75
00:07:51,284 --> 00:07:54,247
And we have plenty of time for questions and comments.

76
00:07:54,607 --> 00:08:00,272
And if anyone has any questions, I don't know how you guys want to do it as we go through the slides or we just wait till the end.

77
00:08:00,292 --> 00:08:03,094
I'm happy to take questions.

78
00:08:07,717 --> 00:08:11,358
So these are just some, some of you have seen these few of these pictures before.

79
00:08:11,438 --> 00:08:15,860
These are just some of the existing conditions we see around Walkling Court.

80
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:23,742
So it's currently 144 units of state aided public housing for low income seniors and disabled households.

81
00:08:25,183 --> 00:08:29,804
All of our units are deeply affordable with our residents income calculated at 30%.

82
00:08:29,845 --> 00:08:32,465
So their rent is 30% of their income.

83
00:08:35,732 --> 00:08:45,257
And to date, and historically, Walkland Court has not received sufficient operating subsidy to address the physical needs.

84
00:08:45,297 --> 00:09:00,985
And specifically because it is state-run public housing, generally federal public housing receives a higher subsidy per unit, which is able to maintain federal developments a lot better than state developments.

85
00:09:01,953 --> 00:09:10,600
So Walkman Court was built in 1963 and suffers from a lot of deficiencies, just poor physical conditions.

86
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,883
The units, even for public housing, it's the undersized units.

87
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,326
It has not been comprehensively modernized.

88
00:09:19,406 --> 00:09:22,108
All the electrical is original to the building.

89
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:23,849
The plumbing's original to the building.

90
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:31,861
And one of the biggest things is that it lacks accessibility features needed for seniors and disabled households, no elevators.

91
00:09:31,941 --> 00:09:37,902
So half of the units, which are 72 units, need to be assessed by stairs.

92
00:09:38,362 --> 00:09:54,506
And as we've explained, as residents age and place there, we get a lot of, it's called reasonable accommodations for residents to move from a second floor unit to a first floor unit, just because the stairs become a real hindrance for our elderly and disabled population.

93
00:09:56,987 --> 00:09:59,367
Go to the next slide.

94
00:09:59,407 --> 00:10:01,728
This is an aerial view of Walkland Court.

95
00:10:02,588 --> 00:10:05,949
There are a total of 11 structures on the site.

96
00:10:06,089 --> 00:10:07,790
There's nine residential buildings.

97
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:11,391
They're all pretty much identical, 16 units per building.

98
00:10:12,271 --> 00:10:21,614
There is a round community center towards the middle of the site, and on the southeast corner of the site, there's a maintenance garage.

99
00:10:22,716 --> 00:10:27,300
And to try to explain, it's a real interesting site because of what borders it.

100
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:33,345
To the West, we have a commercial usage with Whole Foods and Starbucks.

101
00:10:34,466 --> 00:10:38,889
To the south is kind of industrial and commercial.

102
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:41,471
You have the MBTA commuter rail.

103
00:10:43,013 --> 00:10:45,815
There's the Tufts buildings owned by Cummings.

104
00:10:46,315 --> 00:10:47,876
There used to be the

105
00:10:50,266 --> 00:11:00,849
the school for cosmetics, and I can't think of the name of the school right now, but just a lot of industrial mid-rise type buildings, Zuhall building.

106
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:12,233
To the east is your typical Medford residential neighborhood, mainly comprising of two family homes, and to our north is the Mystic River Reservation.

107
00:11:15,505 --> 00:11:24,149
And the next slide, this shows us from so the top left picture shows from kind of our property line looking West.

108
00:11:24,709 --> 00:11:27,711
You can see the parking lot of Whole Foods and Starbucks.

109
00:11:28,151 --> 00:11:29,612
That's their loading dock area.

110
00:11:30,792 --> 00:11:45,417
On your top right, that is a view looking northeast from Auburn Street, looking towards North Street that just shows the typical two-family Medford residential area.

111
00:11:46,318 --> 00:11:57,942
The picture on the bottom is from the North Street bridge showing what that industrial commercial across from the train tracks, mid-rise type buildings.

112
00:12:02,648 --> 00:12:15,765
So, the overview of walking court, the goals of the redevelopment are number 1 to provide high quality, accessible and deeply affordable units to our existing 144 residents, 144 units.

113
00:12:16,065 --> 00:12:20,330
We're also looking to build 94 net new, deeply affordable units.

114
00:12:22,091 --> 00:12:28,576
Within the site and 54 of those being within the 1st phase is going to be 2 phases of this project.

115
00:12:28,596 --> 00:12:39,364
The 1st phase is to replace the 144 units and add 54 units of elderly disabled housing in a mid rise building towards the South of the site.

116
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:44,808
We're looking to improve the resiliency and sustainability of the units on the site.

117
00:12:46,081 --> 00:12:48,943
And improve the site's connection to the surrounding neighborhood.

118
00:12:49,003 --> 00:12:54,147
This site is used as a pedestrian cut through a lot of people coming from North street.

119
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:59,572
Or Boston have like to cut through the site to get to whole foods and to Starbucks.

120
00:13:00,252 --> 00:13:07,678
Um, so we're looking to try to improve on that connectivity to the neighborhood and, um, and welcome pedestrian traffic through the site.

121
00:13:09,257 --> 00:13:12,099
And the redevelopment of Walkman court is a local priority.

122
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:25,807
The replacement of the existing 144 units and then construction of new units on the site is included in the fiscal year 21 to 25 city of Medford's housing production plan as a strategy to meet the city's housing goals.

123
00:13:27,187 --> 00:13:33,592
And all units on the site will remain and will continue to be deeply affordable units.

124
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:37,435
So every single unit is going to be a deeply affordable unit.

125
00:13:37,676 --> 00:13:40,818
Tenants rents, residents rents limited to 30% of their income.

126
00:13:44,194 --> 00:13:55,287
And if you just go back, so you just want to just show this, this picture is just kind of an elevated view from the corner, kind of from the corner of North street and Auburn street.

127
00:13:56,168 --> 00:14:01,994
Showing what the proposed redevelopment would look like with the senior mid rise building towards the south of the site.

128
00:14:03,078 --> 00:14:07,499
Then you have the, there's a family so that that building is a 6 story building.

129
00:14:07,539 --> 00:14:08,120
The 1st.

130
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:16,322
Story being podium parking and some community and administrative spaces and then 5 floors of residential.

131
00:14:17,303 --> 00:14:19,944
Then there's a smaller mid rise building, which is 4 stories.

132
00:14:21,344 --> 00:14:32,801
1st floor being podium parking, possibly podium parking, some community space, and then 3 floors of residential units and then 3 townhouse houses that.

133
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:45,847
directly abut the kind of typical, you know, right along our butters to family homes, which these structures are would be similar to kind of what is it putting them right now?

134
00:14:45,867 --> 00:14:50,692
The height, at least, is similar to what's abutting those neighbors right now.

135
00:14:57,135 --> 00:15:02,717
So, the resident and neighborhood engagement process started back in the late summer, early fall of 2022.

136
00:15:02,877 --> 00:15:08,800
We've had a very active and well attended resident neighborhood engagement process.

137
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,281
We've held at least 7 resident meetings.

138
00:15:11,821 --> 00:15:15,643
We've held 5 full community or neighborhood meetings.

139
00:15:17,477 --> 00:15:27,399
For all of the community meetings, mailings to property owners went out to any abutter touching within 400 feet of any property line.

140
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:43,703
And then we also just went out and delivered flyers to get, we flyer the neighborhoods and went out kind of the blue in this just shows past the 400 feet where we flyer to houses, to households between West Street, Lyman Street, Boston Ave.

141
00:15:44,563 --> 00:15:53,594
We also tried to post notices in some of the more heavily trafficked areas through Walkland Court and around Walkland Court on some telephone poles.

142
00:15:55,770 --> 00:16:06,556
The MHA has met to date with a variety of city departments, including the fire department, building department, engineering department, DPW.

143
00:16:08,057 --> 00:16:19,605
There's also been a lot of public meetings held in relation to the Community Preservation Act funding we received and the zoning that we received back in the fall.

144
00:16:22,428 --> 00:16:27,751
And I believe at this time, I'm turning the presentation now over to Hannah Pilsen.

145
00:16:31,312 --> 00:16:33,473
If there's a way you could unmute Hannah.

146
00:16:36,015 --> 00:16:36,415
Thank you.

147
00:16:47,421 --> 00:16:48,021
Thanks very much.

148
00:16:48,542 --> 00:16:51,763
Good evening, Madam Chair and members of the board.

149
00:16:52,543 --> 00:16:53,904
My name is Hannah Kilson.

150
00:16:53,924 --> 00:16:57,485
I'm a partner at the law firm of Nolan Sheehan Patton in Boston.

151
00:16:58,106 --> 00:17:00,267
I'm in counsel to the Medford Housing Authority.

152
00:17:01,615 --> 00:17:22,174
This evening, as we've noted, we're here for site plan review by the board under the Walkland Court Plan Development District provisions of the Medford Zoning Ordinance, which were adopted and approved by Council, the City Council, on November 4th of 2023.

153
00:17:22,654 --> 00:17:26,878
We use a shorthand to describe this as the PDD 3.

154
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:46,280
As you know, under the PDD-3, the Community Development Board does perform its site plan review in accordance with Section 94-11.7 of the Zoning Ordinance, and it makes recommendations concerning approval or approval with conditions

155
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:58,246
of the site plan application to the city council, who, acting in its capacity as the special permit granting authority, will issue a special permit for the project.

156
00:17:59,786 --> 00:18:10,891
The ordinance specifically notes that any recommended conditions are to take account of the purpose of the PDD-3 and aren't to directly contravene it.

157
00:18:12,051 --> 00:18:15,533
The PDD-3 sets forth the purpose, and I think

158
00:18:16,713 --> 00:18:26,468
Gabe kind of outlined clearly the purpose of the development of Walkling Court, which is to add to the existing 144 units at the site, another 96 units in order to create

159
00:18:31,935 --> 00:18:37,778
238 deeply affordable units, which will exist in five buildings.

160
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:48,063
The 40 of these units will be family units, as noted, being located in the three townhomes and the four-story mid-rise building.

161
00:18:48,563 --> 00:18:57,467
And the balance of these units will be senior and disabled units that are going to be located at that six-story building on the parcel.

162
00:18:57,727 --> 00:19:03,771
and this will result in 83% of the units at the site being for seniors and the disabled.

163
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:17,199
This objective, as noted on the slide, is consistent with the City of Medford's 2023 Comprehensive Plan and the City's Housing Production Plan for fiscal year 21 through 2025.

164
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:24,144
I'd like to allow the design team to walk you through the site application

165
00:19:25,324 --> 00:19:41,273
to demonstrate its satisfaction of the zoning requirements that are set out in the zoning table and to enable you to make the necessary findings under section 94-11.7.10 of the board.

166
00:19:41,834 --> 00:19:50,138
Following that presentation, we'd really welcome any questions or comments concerning the project as a result of the presentation.

167
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:51,519
Thank you.

168
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:57,932
And I think at this point, I'm turning it over to the design team.

169
00:20:11,286 --> 00:20:15,590
OK, but would Danny need to be unmuted then?

170
00:20:15,691 --> 00:20:16,772
Lee needs to be unmuted.

171
00:20:16,792 --> 00:20:17,632
Oh, Lee, sorry.

172
00:20:17,913 --> 00:20:18,093
Yeah.

173
00:20:21,203 --> 00:20:26,769
Thank you very much, and thank you for meeting with us tonight, Madam Chair and board members.

174
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:37,279
I'd like to continue as both Gabe and Hannah have begun to set forth the description of the property and the description of the project as we have described here.

175
00:20:38,248 --> 00:20:43,391
This, I don't want to reiterate too much of what's already been said, so I'll try to speak to other aspects.

176
00:20:44,311 --> 00:20:51,715
I have quite a few slides to go through tonight, so I appreciate your attention and your patience, and we'll try to move through them very succinctly.

177
00:20:51,855 --> 00:20:55,497
If at any point there's a question or clarification, please do stop me.

178
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:02,380
So, beginning here, this is the overview that you saw earlier that Gabe was presenting of the proposed site development.

179
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,581
In the rear is the six-story building.

180
00:21:04,621 --> 00:21:06,401
It's actually one building with two wings.

181
00:21:06,861 --> 00:21:12,582
They're connected in the middle with a sky bridge on all levels, but that's one building in the rear of podium construction.

182
00:21:13,663 --> 00:21:17,323
In the middle of the site is the family building for families with disabilities.

183
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:25,325
And the real benefit of that particular building is it is, like the senior building, it is served by an elevator, which is

184
00:21:26,566 --> 00:21:29,748
extremely important for families who have a member of the family with a disability.

185
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:39,335
It's an extremely shortcoming in public housing supply and this is an occasion where we can finally address that great need within the city of Medford.

186
00:21:40,236 --> 00:21:44,919
In addition, the balance of the family housing is made up in townhouses as Gabe described.

187
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:52,265
Now the placement of these buildings on the site is critical, we believe, to the project's success because

188
00:21:52,845 --> 00:22:00,734
What we're doing here is stitching the neighborhood back together with increased housing units to supply affordable housing that are deeply needed.

189
00:22:01,483 --> 00:22:06,227
But in doing so, we're doing our best to mimic the scale and the proportions of the neighborhood.

190
00:22:06,608 --> 00:22:14,634
And what I mean by that is the six-story buildings in the back are very similar to the scale of the buildings on the other side of the train tracks from them.

191
00:22:14,674 --> 00:22:17,997
That's the Tufts building, the Elizabeth Grady building, the U-Haul storage building.

192
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:21,040
Those are all industrial reuse buildings.

193
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:28,666
They were built for something else before and have been developed to continue their lives and are four to six stories tall and are actually quite large.

194
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:35,991
Our proposed senior building right next to the tracks, in this case, on the other side, is a similar scale.

195
00:22:36,192 --> 00:22:37,832
In fact, a little smaller in footprint.

196
00:22:38,992 --> 00:22:49,155
As we move toward Auburn Street, toward the right side of the image in this picture, we step down the scale of the buildings very purposefully to match the adjacent construction, the adjacent neighborhoods.

197
00:22:49,675 --> 00:22:56,116
By the time you get to backing up to the immediate abutters, the townhouses are the same size as the immediate abutters.

198
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:58,457
The townhouses are two-story buildings with pitch roofs,

199
00:22:59,368 --> 00:23:05,413
They're very similar to the double-deckers or triple-deckers in the neighborhood, or even the single-family houses with two, two-and-a-half stories.

200
00:23:06,074 --> 00:23:11,959
At that point, you have a backyard to backyard condition like you'd expect to see throughout the neighborhood.

201
00:23:12,619 --> 00:23:23,828
In between, the apartment building that sits in the middle is protected from the property edges by pulling it away so that it does not overshadow its neighbors.

202
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:27,291
All of these design moves come from

203
00:23:28,747 --> 00:23:37,310
well-established best practices of urban design for walkable neighborhoods and transit-oriented development.

204
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:46,152
Particularly, you saw in an earlier slide, Gabe was showing how the T runs through here and is projected hopefully someday, fingers crossed, that the Green Line extension comes through here as well.

205
00:23:46,752 --> 00:23:50,733
This all feeds into that walkable neighborhood philosophy.

206
00:23:51,034 --> 00:23:55,955
We'll show you more on the pedestrian safety and traffic calming in the next few slides.

207
00:23:57,433 --> 00:23:57,773
Next slide.

208
00:23:58,153 --> 00:23:58,454
Thank you.

209
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:02,716
To the left is a footprint plan of the buildings.

210
00:24:03,636 --> 00:24:06,038
Building A, all the way to the left, it's a six-story building.

211
00:24:06,238 --> 00:24:08,139
That's the big Pisces-shaped building.

212
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:14,302
In the middle building, B is the four-story building, and then C, D, and E are each of those townhouses.

213
00:24:14,342 --> 00:24:17,844
The image on the right is what the backyard might look like of the senior building.

214
00:24:18,684 --> 00:24:23,107
Looking back toward the track side, back toward the building, it's a protected space just for seniors.

215
00:24:23,887 --> 00:24:25,448
Then the bottom right image is a view

216
00:24:26,059 --> 00:24:28,980
of what the entrance into Walklane Court may look like.

217
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:35,042
Well, we hope it looks like when this is fully completed with a six-story building in the back and the townhouses in the front.

218
00:24:35,262 --> 00:24:41,144
This is actually the same point of view reference that you have currently when you come into Walklane Court off of Auburn Street.

219
00:24:43,585 --> 00:24:43,845
Next slide.

220
00:24:45,195 --> 00:24:50,718
So the overview of the development in this case is what has already been presented as part of the PDD-3.

221
00:24:51,298 --> 00:25:02,344
And this is just showing an illustration of all those numbers and figures to show coverage and poor area and total land area and representations of those various stories.

222
00:25:02,404 --> 00:25:05,125
So this is just for reference more than anything.

223
00:25:08,027 --> 00:25:08,407
Next slide.

224
00:25:10,555 --> 00:25:19,105
When it comes to the exterior of the building, we were very careful to design both the senior apartments, the six-story building, as well as the rest of the buildings on the site.

225
00:25:19,746 --> 00:25:24,872
We were deliberately careful to incorporate them into the vocabulary that already exists in the neighborhood.

226
00:25:25,072 --> 00:25:29,177
What I mean by that is, architects speak for, we wanted to mimic the

227
00:25:31,358 --> 00:25:33,540
building so it feels like it's a part of the context.

228
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:44,106
It's extremely important not only for the residents to feel that they're at home and in a familiar place, but also for the neighborhood to feel like it maybe was always there, hopefully, when it's done.

229
00:25:44,687 --> 00:25:54,473
And so we do that through mimicking window size and shape, as you see in the top image, window rhythm of the larger buildings across the tracks with the middle images.

230
00:25:55,274 --> 00:25:57,335
And then we also wanted to pull in on some of the

231
00:25:58,146 --> 00:26:08,049
The more local aspects of the characteristics of Medford, like bay windows, are extremely prevalent in the residential architecture design of the neighborhood.

232
00:26:08,089 --> 00:26:09,550
You see bay windows all over the place.

233
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:13,291
And so we wanted to try to emulate that on a larger scale.

234
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:14,712
And so that's what you're seeing here.

235
00:26:14,892 --> 00:26:16,312
And you'll see more of that in the presentation.

236
00:26:16,952 --> 00:26:17,333
Next slide.

237
00:26:18,913 --> 00:26:23,675
We're achieving the exterior design through familiar and

238
00:26:25,335 --> 00:26:27,817
well-observed materials that you see throughout the neighborhood.

239
00:26:28,257 --> 00:26:33,701
These are robust versions of residential materials, typically used for buildings of this size.

240
00:26:33,761 --> 00:26:41,286
They're lower maintenance, they're very durable and meant to last a long time, but they're very familiar to residential neighborhoods.

241
00:26:41,406 --> 00:26:43,408
Board and batten siding, clabbered siding.

242
00:26:44,048 --> 00:26:47,491
bricks, cement board panels, and high-quality windows.

243
00:26:47,531 --> 00:26:52,716
These are the things that you would want your home made out of, and it's very similar to the context.

244
00:26:52,776 --> 00:27:00,904
The only difference is that the quality is of a higher quality grade so that it will last longer and reduce the required maintenance by the housing authority.

245
00:27:00,924 --> 00:27:02,846
Next slide.

246
00:27:04,624 --> 00:27:10,708
This is the artist rendering, our artist rendering view of the entrance from the North Street Bridge.

247
00:27:11,228 --> 00:27:14,150
This is kind of up as you're coming off the bridge, and you'd be turning in.

248
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:15,611
So this is looking north.

249
00:27:17,772 --> 00:27:23,156
You can see really carefully, this view shows off really well the scale stepping.

250
00:27:23,176 --> 00:27:25,137
So what I mean by that is the big

251
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:51,280
the big building is to the left at six stories and it steps down so that in the back you see the four-story building middle of the site and then over to the right you see through the trees just a little bit that townhouse which is a two-story scale so your your bills with grady building in this case is right to your left and it definitely steps down as you move into the site and uh you're also beginning to see some of the pedestrian calming features and the walkable neighborhood that we're promoting here the crosswalk for example is raised um

252
00:27:52,071 --> 00:27:52,891
uh, as you cross over.

253
00:27:52,931 --> 00:27:55,612
So it's, it's, it's kind of like a large speed hump called a speed table.

254
00:27:56,252 --> 00:28:01,174
And, uh, this, uh, discourages speedy traffic because if you go too fast, you'll bottom out.

255
00:28:01,854 --> 00:28:06,456
Um, but also the, the road next down at that point, so there's not parking and a crosswalk.

256
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:10,797
The crosswalk happens at the narrowest portion of the road, which protects pedestrian safety.

257
00:28:11,573 --> 00:28:19,075
There's also continuity of sidewalks and curbs and places to sit, all giving drivers the indication that this is a place to slow down.

258
00:28:20,715 --> 00:28:24,596
We believe it will discourage cut-throughs, which we'll show a little bit more of later.

259
00:28:25,856 --> 00:28:27,756
Next.

260
00:28:27,816 --> 00:28:34,958
As we then step away from the senior building and move into the rest of the development, you see here now a little bit of a zoom in on the townhouses.

261
00:28:35,238 --> 00:28:40,079
For the townhouses, it's very easy to relate their architecture to the neighborhood because it really is the same stuff.

262
00:28:41,682 --> 00:28:47,384
We were very specific in the way we chose shingle roof, asphalt shingle roofs, which are common throughout the neighborhood.

263
00:28:47,964 --> 00:28:56,308
Really playing up that bay window right in the middle of the view is a major feature of the townhouses, and also the columned porches.

264
00:28:57,208 --> 00:29:09,753
In this case, the townhouses, the middle of each of the townhouses share a columned porch for protected entry for each of the townhouses, but it's a scale-up version of what you'd see throughout the neighborhood.

265
00:29:09,773 --> 00:29:10,273
Then lastly,

266
00:29:11,077 --> 00:29:15,900
The way that we orient the roof actually helps maintain the character of the neighborhood.

267
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:25,385
As we drove around the neighborhood and walked around and took photos, we found that a lot of the roof's peaks face the street as opposed to just the wide part of the roof.

268
00:29:25,485 --> 00:29:34,870
And so we turned each of the ends of the peaks of the townhouses to mimic that proportion so that it looks very much like a single-family or double-family residence throughout the neighborhood.

269
00:29:37,568 --> 00:29:49,278
These materials seem very similar to the previous materials because we're using them throughout the site to create continuity and also a homogeneity of architectural expressions so that it really does feel like they belong to each other.

270
00:29:49,638 --> 00:30:00,547
The difference would be, of course, we can pick a number of colors from the manufacturer's standard colors and textures to give the whole development a sense of variety and natural construction.

271
00:30:01,168 --> 00:30:03,470
So it kind of grows over time kind of thing.

272
00:30:07,255 --> 00:30:10,316
And then finally, the last building we're going to talk about is in the middle of the site.

273
00:30:10,816 --> 00:30:13,716
And this is the four-story building that Kate mentioned a little bit ago.

274
00:30:13,796 --> 00:30:15,116
It's the family building.

275
00:30:15,737 --> 00:30:19,237
And this one is very much like a tall townhouse, really.

276
00:30:19,297 --> 00:30:23,498
It's like a three-story townhouse on a base or a podium, which is what we call it.

277
00:30:24,138 --> 00:30:34,300
And in this one, it was just a play of tall bay windows and kind of a repeating pattern that seems very much like you'd see in kind of a middle-sized building.

278
00:30:36,057 --> 00:30:45,167
We also see double hung windows to mimic the standard windows you'd see in residential houses around to try to bring the scale down and make it still personable.

279
00:30:46,449 --> 00:30:46,889
Next question.

280
00:30:50,253 --> 00:30:51,054
Next one, please.

281
00:30:54,204 --> 00:30:54,464
Excellent.

282
00:30:54,964 --> 00:30:59,667
And so here's the artist's rendering of that view, a little bit more polished and give you a better sense of what it might be like.

283
00:31:00,147 --> 00:31:03,909
You can see we're heavily prioritizing the pedestrian experience.

284
00:31:03,949 --> 00:31:07,931
And this shot is really the heart of the neighborhood as it's being redeveloped.

285
00:31:11,332 --> 00:31:26,710
offering both parking but also a place to sit, a main entrance to the central building, and also you can see how the buildings around the central family apartment building contribute to the feeling of neighborhood through their scale, placement of street trees, planters, and that kind of thing.

286
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:33,223
I'll walk you through this.

287
00:31:33,263 --> 00:31:36,804
We have three different illustrations of a shadow analysis.

288
00:31:37,184 --> 00:31:47,548
What we mean by shadow analysis is we take three different times of year and we plot how the shadows will move around the site based on the buildings, the trees, and the neighborhood.

289
00:31:47,728 --> 00:31:49,468
We have a spring, fall, equinox here.

290
00:31:49,488 --> 00:31:51,169
They're the same, so we just do one of them.

291
00:31:51,769 --> 00:31:54,930
Then we have two others, but I'll go through this one first and we can compare.

292
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:56,811
We take a number of times a day.

293
00:31:57,392 --> 00:32:02,617
We start with 9 a.m., noon, and 3 p.m., and we see how the shadows swing across the site.

294
00:32:02,857 --> 00:32:09,963
Now, at the equinox, the sun's about halfway up of where it'll be throughout the year, so this gives us a pretty good sense of the median.

295
00:32:10,123 --> 00:32:11,745
Most of the time, it's somewhere around this.

296
00:32:12,586 --> 00:32:13,967
The blue shadows

297
00:32:14,785 --> 00:32:19,809
that you're seeing represent the darker the blue color is, the more frequently the area is shadowed.

298
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:24,953
On the left is the existing conditions, and on the right is the proposed condition.

299
00:32:25,574 --> 00:32:35,562
You can see by putting the larger buildings toward the bottom of the screen or closer to the tracks, most of the shadows stay on the property most of the time, and the deepest of the shadows remain on the property.

300
00:32:36,062 --> 00:32:41,867
You can see that by the dark blue areas around the senior building and also around the family building in the middle.

301
00:32:42,474 --> 00:32:51,203
But you can also see the shadows are not substantially larger than what's there now due to the mature trees and to the two plus story apartment buildings.

302
00:32:51,683 --> 00:32:52,825
So if we go to the next slide.

303
00:32:54,679 --> 00:33:06,767
there's not many shadows at all and that's because this is the summer solstice and this is when the sun is the highest and it's not very hard to keep your shadows on your own site because the sun is very much the highest angle in the sky.

304
00:33:07,168 --> 00:33:12,892
But you can see in this case that almost no shadows from our buildings trespass across the property lines.

305
00:33:13,352 --> 00:33:17,295
You'll also notice that some of the shade, well actually we'll see that in the next one.

306
00:33:17,835 --> 00:33:18,896
Let's go to the last one more.

307
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:21,070
Thank you very much.

308
00:33:21,611 --> 00:33:23,091
This is a big comparison.

309
00:33:23,131 --> 00:33:25,012
This is showing the winter solstice.

310
00:33:26,213 --> 00:33:29,194
In the case of the winter solstice, the sun is always at a low angle.

311
00:33:29,314 --> 00:33:30,955
I don't really need to tell you that right now.

312
00:33:30,995 --> 00:33:33,937
It's dark outside, but the sun is at a low angle.

313
00:33:34,097 --> 00:33:37,939
Much of the shadowing that's happening on the site is actually due to the trees.

314
00:33:38,959 --> 00:33:42,940
And the shadows in the neighbors' houses are a combination of the trees and each other's houses.

315
00:33:44,201 --> 00:33:52,003
And you'll see that there is a pretty dark section of shadow around the senior building and the family buildings, but so too around the neighborhood.

316
00:33:52,783 --> 00:34:00,406
The houses are close enough together in this neighborhood, which is typical in an urban neighborhood like this, that they shadow each other in the winter along with the trees.

317
00:34:00,806 --> 00:34:07,548
And so we were very careful in placing the buildings on site to make sure that we would still maintain good solar access

318
00:34:08,168 --> 00:34:10,770
for the neighbors and for the buildings ourselves.

319
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:25,021
You can see we're not actually shadowing the middle family building all that much with the senior building, and we made sure to maintain enough space between them so that we could still have really beautifully landscaped areas, trees, and wonderful places to sit even in the winter.

320
00:34:26,663 --> 00:34:27,043
Next slide.

321
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:45,791
And so what we're hoping to show here is that through the bulk, meaning size and placement of these buildings and their relative height to each other in the neighborhood, that we have not presented a detrimental effect on the neighborhood, on the private development of it, and on the neighbors as a whole.

322
00:34:46,571 --> 00:34:47,773
And I hope you'll find that too.

323
00:34:50,907 --> 00:35:01,633
All right, so for this next one, I'm actually going to speak briefly on this, and then we're going to move over to Josue in a couple of slides to get into some more of the more technical site information.

324
00:35:01,653 --> 00:35:04,915
But for this first one, this is really just talking about parking.

325
00:35:05,555 --> 00:35:08,176
And parking, we know, really boils down to the numbers.

326
00:35:08,437 --> 00:35:09,317
Excuse me, Brian, did you?

327
00:35:09,337 --> 00:35:14,540
No, oh, you're coming.

328
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:15,761
Just on muted.

329
00:35:16,402 --> 00:35:17,002
Okay, very good.

330
00:35:17,143 --> 00:35:17,403
No worries.

331
00:35:17,423 --> 00:35:17,623
Brian.

332
00:35:17,964 --> 00:35:20,347
Brian will join us in just a second to talk about traffic as well.

333
00:35:21,929 --> 00:35:22,450
For this 1st, 1.

334
00:35:23,912 --> 00:35:24,773
It boils down to the numbers.

335
00:35:25,474 --> 00:35:31,942
And in this case, what we're doing is we're providing 153 total parking spaces, which is a little bit more than.

336
00:35:33,203 --> 00:35:34,884
the required parking ratio.

337
00:35:35,504 --> 00:35:39,105
It's a little bit more, but in actuality ends up being quite a lot more parking spaces more.

338
00:35:39,305 --> 00:35:47,587
And so, in this case, we are providing 0.65 parking spaces per unit, which is greater than the 0.5 ratio required by affordable housing.

339
00:35:48,387 --> 00:35:54,469
And it's, we're also adding a total of, excuse me,

340
00:35:57,053 --> 00:35:57,693
Sorry, I misspoke.

341
00:35:58,393 --> 00:36:08,896
For the family, for the senior parking, there'll be the 40 spaces in the building as well as the 99 spaces overall, and then additional 40 spaces for the families.

342
00:36:10,316 --> 00:36:14,858
Also included in this count is parking for maintenance, management, and residential staff.

343
00:36:15,218 --> 00:36:22,379
So this is commensurate to the parking that's provided at other NHA sites and as well above what is required.

344
00:36:22,399 --> 00:36:24,460
Next slide.

345
00:36:29,231 --> 00:36:29,532
Thank you.

346
00:36:30,273 --> 00:36:36,105
And so now I'd like to bring in Brian to speak a little bit more about the site analysis and traffic.

347
00:36:36,878 --> 00:36:37,519
There we go.

348
00:36:37,859 --> 00:36:38,279
Thank you.

349
00:36:38,299 --> 00:36:39,080
Sorry about that.

350
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,662
I was trying to follow directions and raise my hand.

351
00:36:42,343 --> 00:36:43,484
My name is Brian Zamocca.

352
00:36:43,624 --> 00:36:49,890
I'm a senior project manager at Niche Engineering, where I focus on transportation permitting and planning.

353
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:59,658
So Niche was tasked with developing the traffic study for this project to determine any potential impacts to the neighborhood and the adjacent roadways.

354
00:36:59,698 --> 00:37:01,620
This was conducted in November 23.

355
00:37:03,081 --> 00:37:06,342
So first, I just want to talk about access and circulation.

356
00:37:06,442 --> 00:37:21,207
So this, I mean, it was kind of discussed by Lee a little bit, but the existing access configuration is to maintain a long urban street, which is really essential to understanding, you know, the future circulation.

357
00:37:22,027 --> 00:37:35,491
Additional access is proposed on North Street across from Marshall Street, and that's going to be a secondary access that we have determined is going to be less utilized than the Auburn one.

358
00:37:35,591 --> 00:37:37,152
I will go into that in a minute.

359
00:37:38,752 --> 00:37:56,374
But what I do want to point out on this slide is you can see that the fire department did have input on the access and circulation patterns as well as the width and the team coordinated very well with them to make sure that all the fire department requirements.

360
00:37:57,295 --> 00:37:59,196
we're met.

361
00:37:59,497 --> 00:38:05,140
I'm going to give you kind of a super high level overview of the traffic study in itself in terms of the data.

362
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:07,822
So what we did, we did our safety analysis.

363
00:38:07,842 --> 00:38:16,887
We reviewed crash reports from 2015 to 2019, which is the available acceptable data to the state.

364
00:38:17,467 --> 00:38:20,429
And what we found is they're all below state averages.

365
00:38:22,485 --> 00:38:38,635
It's not really probably that alarming, but most of the higher number of crashes occurred at Auburn and Mystic Valley and North Street and Boston Ave, which are basically the two main intersections in the neighborhood.

366
00:38:39,695 --> 00:38:43,377
There were low number of crashes at all the other intersections.

367
00:38:46,259 --> 00:38:58,008
In terms of safety, we're not proposing any mitigation measures anywhere along the site, at least with regard to geometric changes in infrastructure.

368
00:38:59,228 --> 00:39:02,030
So let's talk about the amount of trips that this will generate.

369
00:39:03,692 --> 00:39:05,613
This is going to generate approximately

370
00:39:07,173 --> 00:39:11,714
at the end of the day, about 1,000 daily trips, which sounds a lot more than it is.

371
00:39:12,134 --> 00:39:19,936
Because when you think about it in terms of your peak commuter times, you're going to be seeing about 60 in the morning, 70 in the evening.

372
00:39:20,056 --> 00:39:24,717
And to just put that in context, that's coming in and out of the site.

373
00:39:25,677 --> 00:39:31,099
In one hour, you're going to see one car per minute, which is fairly negligible.

374
00:39:33,073 --> 00:39:42,540
And just as a pure context from the actual neighborhood in itself to the east, from Connington Street and West Street, there's going to be one car about 10 minutes.

375
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:51,366
So in essence, you're not going to feel, from a neighborhood perspective, any impact to traffic as a result of this project.

376
00:39:53,028 --> 00:39:55,489
What we kind of found for trip distribution.

377
00:39:55,569 --> 00:40:00,553
So we do our trip distribution based on the existing travel pattern and access locations.

378
00:40:02,106 --> 00:40:03,987
for where the most site-generated traffic will be.

379
00:40:04,867 --> 00:40:19,551
We determined, based on the travel patterns, that Auburn Street is going to be the main access driveway, which is then going to lead to any impacts that will occur will occur at Auburn Street and Mystic Valley.

380
00:40:20,452 --> 00:40:31,295
We're only estimating about 25% of trips will leave out of the North Street driveway, which is across from Marshall Street, and they will be primarily using the North Street and Boston Ave.

381
00:40:31,855 --> 00:40:33,618
So what does that mean in terms of impacts?

382
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,241
Very little.

383
00:40:36,323 --> 00:40:43,536
There's going to be a slight minor increase in delay at Auburn Street and Mystic Valley, a very, very busy intersection as is.

384
00:40:45,616 --> 00:41:04,297
We determined that it could alleviate some congestion and delay by adjusting some minor signal timing changes, but any kind of signal timing changes would have to be, you know, go through City of Medford and the Transportation Department there.

385
00:41:06,059 --> 00:41:06,960
Next slide, please.

386
00:41:09,089 --> 00:41:17,414
So this one, I'm going to keep it short because Lee pretty much summed up all the pedestrian and safety improvements that are being made on site.

387
00:41:18,334 --> 00:41:30,901
Just to kind of rehash what he was saying, you could see that at the gateway midway, narrowing the effective roadway width with bump out shortens the pedestrian crossings and encourages lower speeds.

388
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:36,684
The speed tables, the chicanes that are shown, they're all

389
00:41:38,065 --> 00:41:39,745
effective means of slowing traffic.

390
00:41:39,826 --> 00:41:44,647
Obviously, going over a speed table, you hit that bump, as Lee mentioned.

391
00:41:45,167 --> 00:41:52,229
And then the raised crosswalks that are being shown, similar to the speed tables, they force cars to slow down.

392
00:41:53,029 --> 00:42:00,491
And as it relates to pedestrians, they actually encourage a continuous path of travel across the site driveways.

393
00:42:00,931 --> 00:42:03,272
And that's really beneficial to make sure that

394
00:42:05,204 --> 00:42:15,090
We maintain that ADA compliance and maintain a safe crossing for anybody just walking along the road and not necessarily going into the actual site.

395
00:42:17,491 --> 00:42:24,815
I'm going to stop there and I'll pass it on to the next person.

396
00:42:30,778 --> 00:42:31,458
Thank you very much.

397
00:42:31,976 --> 00:42:32,456
Thank you, Brian.

398
00:42:32,476 --> 00:42:33,417
I really appreciate that.

399
00:42:34,657 --> 00:42:37,858
In addition, I want to push home that last point a little bit more.

400
00:42:45,411 --> 00:42:58,483
using technical description of gateways is it's going to feel more like you're driving into a driveway coming into the site on Walkland Court, either from North Street or from Auburn, than it will feel like a road intersection.

401
00:42:58,543 --> 00:43:03,388
That's because you're going to drive up and into the site rather than it being fully flush.

402
00:43:03,468 --> 00:43:08,092
So you drive essentially up over the sidewalk, the ramp of course, but it feels more like a driveway.

403
00:43:08,132 --> 00:43:08,513
And that will

404
00:43:11,861 --> 00:43:23,856
So that was a request the city had in our meeting that we had with them with the department heads and we really appreciate that suggestion because that really helps us refine how we're going to pull this off so thank you Brian for reminding me of that.

405
00:43:24,958 --> 00:43:25,659
The next slide more.

406
00:43:26,485 --> 00:43:27,045
Thank you very much.

407
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:29,966
So trash disposal, this is a huge issue in the city.

408
00:43:30,846 --> 00:43:34,167
And I know that because rodent controls is a big issue.

409
00:43:34,787 --> 00:43:48,030
The big takeaway here is that buildings A and B, so the six story senior building and the four story family building that are in the middle of site will both be served by enclosed trash rooms inside the building.

410
00:43:48,290 --> 00:43:52,591
They'll have trash chutes, trash compactors and contain trash rooms.

411
00:43:52,611 --> 00:43:56,392
So no trash will be outside the site until trash day when the bins are wheeled

412
00:43:56,512 --> 00:43:59,293
out there, taken by the trash trucks and then they're wheeled back in.

413
00:44:00,233 --> 00:44:10,896
The three townhouse buildings, a total of 16 units, will share one dumpster enclosure that's indicated here far away from the adjacent neighbors, well within the site.

414
00:44:11,416 --> 00:44:17,477
And that is an effective reduction of households using exterior trash storage from 144, which it is now, down to just 16.

415
00:44:20,596 --> 00:44:26,042
So this is a huge improvement as far as road control and trash and waste control on the site.

416
00:44:26,882 --> 00:44:43,759
These trash rooms, chutes, and waste structures like the dumpster caddy, if you will, were coordinated with the city and coordinated with MHA to accommodate easy pickup and delivery.

417
00:44:46,741 --> 00:44:48,941
moving through the site with the trash trucks.

418
00:44:50,042 --> 00:44:50,882
Sorry, it's getting late.

419
00:44:52,122 --> 00:44:52,723
Next slide, please.

420
00:44:54,243 --> 00:45:02,466
So for this slide, I am actually going to bring Josue Valdez into the conversation from Professor O'Neill, and he's going to talk a little bit about the public infrastructure.

421
00:45:02,846 --> 00:45:03,286
Thank you, Josue.

422
00:45:09,193 --> 00:45:11,075
Do I have my hand raised?

423
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:11,836
Sorry for that.

424
00:45:13,558 --> 00:45:13,978
Thank you.

425
00:45:14,398 --> 00:45:16,220
My name is Josue Valdez.

426
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:30,514
I'm a civil engineer with FOSA O'Neill, and we are pretty much the side civil consultants for the project, working closely with DEETS and the rest of the design team.

427
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:39,081
So overall for the site, I'm here to speak a little bit on the utilities and how we are servicing the site.

428
00:45:40,662 --> 00:45:43,585
Overall, we are proposing all new utilities for the site.

429
00:45:44,445 --> 00:45:47,087
I'm going to start by talking a little bit about stormwater.

430
00:45:47,107 --> 00:45:48,488
It's an important one here.

431
00:45:48,509 --> 00:45:54,994
Currently, the site has no stormwater treatment or storage on site.

432
00:45:55,846 --> 00:46:08,052
which in the long run could affect properties that are kind of downstream because they're being impacted by the runoff from the site.

433
00:46:08,072 --> 00:46:18,798
Under the proposed condition, we are proposing multiple best management practices from a stormwater standpoint to promote stormwater storage.

434
00:46:19,558 --> 00:46:21,739
treatment, and infiltration on site.

435
00:46:21,859 --> 00:46:27,802
So all of that is going to happen before the stormwater actually leaves our property, to put it in simple ways.

436
00:46:29,122 --> 00:46:41,868
So that will help decrease any downstream stormwater problems that could be happening on the neighborhood.

437
00:46:44,305 --> 00:46:51,372
From a water perspective, we're going to be proposing a new 8-inch water line that is going to be looping throughout the site.

438
00:46:52,593 --> 00:46:59,679
What we mean by looping is that we are actually going to be connecting Auburn and North Street with the 8-inch water main.

439
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,701
Why is this important to note?

440
00:47:02,242 --> 00:47:06,646
Because by doing this, we're actually providing a new

441
00:47:08,877 --> 00:47:27,855
have for the water service, that if any maintenance or repairs needs to happen within the intersection of Alvern and North Street, technically our 8-inch main shore site could be used as a temporary water main for the rest of the adjacent properties.

442
00:47:30,005 --> 00:47:41,170
Telecom, gas and electric will also be new services connecting to the existing services on Auburn and North Street.

443
00:47:42,051 --> 00:47:46,973
And from a sewer perspective, we're going to be also providing new services

444
00:47:48,594 --> 00:47:59,678
half of the site and by half I actually mean the senior building is going to be actually connecting to the existing public sewer main on North Street.

445
00:48:00,358 --> 00:48:11,342
Meanwhile, the family buildings are the one more towards the north where you have the townhomes and the four-story family building are going to be serviced from Elroy Street.

446
00:48:13,222 --> 00:48:38,908
Overall, our findings showed, after coordination with the city, city engineer, DPW, and all the entities involved, and our own calculations, that the proposed project should not create an adverse impact on the public services of the city, and that the current public services should be sufficient to

447
00:48:40,788 --> 00:48:47,555
provide enough of these utilities for the proposed project.

448
00:48:50,197 --> 00:48:53,921
So now I will handle back to Dingis Lee again.

449
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:54,522
Thank you.

450
00:49:02,790 --> 00:49:03,371
Thank you very much.

451
00:49:03,731 --> 00:49:04,672
I really appreciate that.

452
00:49:05,432 --> 00:49:08,635
At this point, we'd like to bring in Kelly Ashton from Terra Inc.

453
00:49:08,735 --> 00:49:10,517
Kelly is our landscape architect.

454
00:49:10,597 --> 00:49:18,824
She's going to speak to a number of landscape design aspects and the tree characteristics over the next four or five slides.

455
00:49:19,164 --> 00:49:19,384
Kelly.

456
00:49:22,046 --> 00:49:22,647
Thank you, Lee.

457
00:49:22,847 --> 00:49:23,788
Good evening, everyone.

458
00:49:24,919 --> 00:49:26,160
Thank you for having me here.

459
00:49:26,861 --> 00:49:28,142
My name is Kelly Ashton.

460
00:49:28,462 --> 00:49:29,423
I'm with Terra Inc.

461
00:49:29,463 --> 00:49:34,247
We're the landscape architects on the project working closely with DEETS and the design team.

462
00:49:34,707 --> 00:49:39,131
So I'm just going to do a quick little overview here of the landscape plan.

463
00:49:39,811 --> 00:49:52,682
The overall goal was to really just enhance what's already there by creating a welcoming sense of place for both the residents, the neighbors, and the visitors.

464
00:49:53,159 --> 00:49:59,223
We're doing that by creating some accessible walkways throughout with some spaces for gathering.

465
00:49:59,923 --> 00:50:03,946
As we know, the existing trees here are a very cherished amenity.

466
00:50:03,966 --> 00:50:11,050
So we're trying hard to preserve as many as we possibly can, while being very mindful of safety.

467
00:50:11,751 --> 00:50:13,992
So we'll get into a slide about that shortly.

468
00:50:14,722 --> 00:50:24,450
And then we're also introducing some new trees of varying species to provide shade, provide seasonal interest, and then also just to really harness this sense of place.

469
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:30,715
Next slide, please.

470
00:50:30,735 --> 00:50:35,899
So here, this is just, that's just again, zooming in on the landscape plan here.

471
00:50:35,919 --> 00:50:40,142
So you can really see some of the existing trees or the larger canopies.

472
00:50:40,796 --> 00:50:44,502
And then some gathering nodes throughout and then the accessible walkways.

473
00:50:44,743 --> 00:50:45,304
Next slide.

474
00:50:48,269 --> 00:50:49,831
So here is an overview of.

475
00:50:51,527 --> 00:51:00,050
Basically, when we looked at the site, you know, we do a thorough evaluation of given the strict constraints of where construction is happening in proximity to root zones.

476
00:51:00,570 --> 00:51:14,735
Also, in conjunction with a thorough arborist report of the health and vigor of each existing tree on site, we were able to assess 52 mature trees on site, eight of which will be able to safely preserve.

477
00:51:15,703 --> 00:51:21,829
And then 12 are actually pear trees that were recently planted that will be relocated to another property.

478
00:51:21,849 --> 00:51:27,615
And so those trees are highlighted in green that we are preserving.

479
00:51:28,296 --> 00:51:29,117
Next slide, please.

480
00:51:31,574 --> 00:51:40,602
And then here is just a really brief conceptual overview showing what the trees will look like in canopy from an aerial view over time.

481
00:51:41,543 --> 00:51:47,448
So the first three images at the top are actually a graphic of the welcome port development.

482
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:53,284
showing phase 1 of the senior housing, what the trees will look like at installation.

483
00:51:54,385 --> 00:51:59,089
The next photo to the right is what they will look like in 10 years from installation.

484
00:51:59,490 --> 00:52:04,394
And then the final image to the far right is what they would look like in about 20 years.

485
00:52:05,034 --> 00:52:13,221
So it's a graphic representation to conceptually illustrate over time what those trees will look like from canopy.

486
00:52:13,301 --> 00:52:16,984
Below that is an example of a project in real,

487
00:52:17,666 --> 00:52:24,912
imagery of similar to compare what that looks like from install three years, 10 years to 20 years.

488
00:52:26,354 --> 00:52:28,335
And from there, I'll hand it back over to the team.

489
00:52:28,736 --> 00:52:29,016
Thank you.

490
00:52:34,565 --> 00:52:35,165
Thank you, Kelly.

491
00:52:35,205 --> 00:52:36,186
I really appreciate that.

492
00:52:37,826 --> 00:52:39,767
I look forward to the discussion about this as well.

493
00:52:39,787 --> 00:52:43,569
But this is a wonderful prediction of where we're going with the site.

494
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:46,771
So the next slide, please, Maura.

495
00:52:47,851 --> 00:52:49,752
So I thank everyone for your patience.

496
00:52:49,772 --> 00:52:52,593
I see we're coming up on about an hour now since the beginning of the meeting.

497
00:52:52,873 --> 00:52:54,614
And I know we've gone over a lot.

498
00:52:54,874 --> 00:52:58,056
We're almost finished with the architectural presentation at this point.

499
00:52:58,356 --> 00:53:00,637
But there are a couple of really important things that we want to talk about.

500
00:53:01,377 --> 00:53:04,481
One of them is the site lighting and safety.

501
00:53:04,501 --> 00:53:13,032
The site lighting is so key to both a safe environment in an urban context, but also a healthy environment.

502
00:53:13,052 --> 00:53:17,718
And what I mean by that is we don't want the lighting that we use to illuminate the site at night.

503
00:53:18,178 --> 00:53:22,342
to spill over onto the neighbor's properties, what's called light trespass.

504
00:53:23,062 --> 00:53:29,328
It's not allowed and it's not good for plants and other animals, especially ourselves if you happen to have a bedroom near the site.

505
00:53:29,408 --> 00:53:34,452
So what we're designing for the site is a two-tiered lighting structure, which you can see here.

506
00:53:34,872 --> 00:53:44,501
There's pedestrian lighting at just 10 feet above the sidewalks, which is a wonderful height because it's tall enough to be out of reach, but not so tall that

507
00:53:46,402 --> 00:53:48,403
that it feels like you're flooding the entire area with light.

508
00:53:48,423 --> 00:53:53,145
So it's a human scale pedestrian lighting, and those will be on poles, as you're seeing in this illustration.

509
00:53:53,225 --> 00:53:59,488
And then just a little bit further up at 14 feet is the site parking lighting.

510
00:54:00,048 --> 00:54:12,053
And 14 feet is actually pretty low for site parking lighting, but it was deliberately set at that height because that's the height of the second floor of our buildings, both the senior building and the mid-rise family building, and we don't want the lights to shine into people's

511
00:54:13,134 --> 00:54:14,015
apartments there either.

512
00:54:14,536 --> 00:54:15,557
These are 100% full cut-off fixtures.

513
00:54:17,732 --> 00:54:20,273
What that means is no light goes up from these fixtures.

514
00:54:20,353 --> 00:54:22,054
All the light is going down.

515
00:54:23,634 --> 00:54:36,580
If you take a look around on your way home tonight through your neighborhood, you'll notice that a lot of the light coming off of street lights and other kinds of site lights tends to go way up in the air and flood the sides of buildings and the atmosphere.

516
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:44,823
And we're taking a very proactive approach here to use full cutoff fixtures to light only what we need to, the site we're actually walking and parking.

517
00:54:45,926 --> 00:54:49,609
with adequate light for safety and nothing else.

518
00:54:49,969 --> 00:54:55,132
And to prove that out a little bit more, the next slide shows what that looks like through photometric analysis.

519
00:54:55,633 --> 00:55:06,240
So this is an actual analysis done by a lighting engineer for our project, showing where the cutoff of those lights sits on the site.

520
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:09,101
So these lights have a rather focused

521
00:55:10,562 --> 00:55:16,028
spread, and you can see here that almost none of this light goes across the property line.

522
00:55:16,328 --> 00:55:25,237
There's a little trespass on the far left side onto the MBTA site where the train tracks are, but no one's actually living there, so that shouldn't be an issue.

523
00:55:25,777 --> 00:55:32,424
And also, it is at the exit point of one of our drives coming out of the parking garage, so we want to make sure that's adequately lit.

524
00:55:32,804 --> 00:55:38,588
There's a little trespass also on North Street up against that retaining wall, but the retaining wall rises, so that may not be trespassing at all.

525
00:55:38,968 --> 00:55:44,112
But you can see that all the pedestrian and vehicular areas are adequately lit for safety in the public realm.

526
00:55:44,312 --> 00:55:46,113
Not the backyards, but the front yards.

527
00:55:49,725 --> 00:55:55,047
And that is actually, I think, the end of the design presentation.

528
00:55:55,067 --> 00:56:15,033
You'll see through the site design that you've seen today that we hope you can find that we're protecting the natural resources and that we're providing a safe and well-lit environment that is adequate for the neighborhood safety and does not diminish the usability of the adjacent properties.

529
00:56:16,786 --> 00:56:17,266
I think that's it.

530
00:56:17,306 --> 00:56:17,747
Next slide.

531
00:56:18,587 --> 00:56:21,469
For this, I'm going to go back to, is it Gabe or Jeff?

532
00:56:22,089 --> 00:56:23,230
Are you going to finish up on this one?

533
00:56:32,595 --> 00:56:32,936
Sorry.

534
00:56:39,179 --> 00:56:39,960
It's still me.

535
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:40,700
Pardon me.

536
00:56:41,201 --> 00:56:41,821
I'll do one more.

537
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:46,781
Jeff was gonna wrap it up.

538
00:56:47,462 --> 00:56:48,082
Okay.

539
00:56:51,824 --> 00:56:55,706
So if we could give Jeffrey Driscoll the mic.

540
00:56:55,866 --> 00:56:56,186
Thank you.

541
00:56:56,306 --> 00:56:56,786
Thank you, Jeff.

542
00:56:58,647 --> 00:56:59,607
I'm having difficulty.

543
00:57:00,048 --> 00:57:00,308
Okay.

544
00:57:01,170 --> 00:57:01,590
Can you hear me?

545
00:57:02,051 --> 00:57:02,591
Yes, we can.

546
00:57:02,631 --> 00:57:02,932
Thank you.

547
00:57:02,992 --> 00:57:03,352
OK, great.

548
00:57:04,633 --> 00:57:09,698
The overview of what can let me first start and say again, my name is Jeffrey Driscoll.

549
00:57:09,738 --> 00:57:11,880
I'm the executive director of the Housing Authority.

550
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:18,967
And as he of the Medford Housing Authority, I'm cognizant of the impact the authority has upon the community.

551
00:57:19,687 --> 00:57:21,689
Housing authorities provide a lifeline.

552
00:57:22,770 --> 00:57:32,773
for low-income individuals and families who, in many instances, may otherwise face housing insecurity and even homelessness.

553
00:57:33,173 --> 00:57:35,354
And this is what we deal with on a daily basis.

554
00:57:36,154 --> 00:57:47,537
What's different in Medfit is through our efforts, and you've seen a number, or heard from a number of skilled designers today who have assisted us to get to this point.

555
00:57:47,837 --> 00:57:48,818
And I'm very appreciative.

556
00:57:50,098 --> 00:58:00,486
Madam Chair and board members to be before you today and hopefully being able to carry on, allow us to carry on with our mission.

557
00:58:02,007 --> 00:58:07,812
Our efforts have gone beyond that which a housing authority ordinarily would be undertaking.

558
00:58:08,552 --> 00:58:18,320
I like to say that we're one of, if not the most progressive housing authority in an apolitical way in Massachusetts and even beyond those borders.

559
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:36,005
between what we are doing at 121 Riverside at Saltonstall Apartments, increasing from 200 units to 222 units, $146 million project that we're undertaking there, and then coming forward with the redevelopment of Walkling Court.

560
00:58:36,605 --> 00:58:49,742
which has traditionally, in my experience, and I go back with the Housing Authority into the 80s, I became directly involved as legal counsel in 2009 and executive director and legal counsel in 2017, and what sets us apart

561
00:58:53,787 --> 00:59:07,365
is the fact that we're not looking to maintain, only maintain our units, we're looking to extend those beyond the boundaries that most housing authorities are able to undertake and accomplish.

562
00:59:07,725 --> 00:59:08,566
And Walker & Court

563
00:59:09,827 --> 00:59:18,111
in my estimation, and that of others, has oftentimes been thought of as the poor sister of the housing authority.

564
00:59:18,131 --> 00:59:32,836
And Gabe alluded to that earlier this evening by indicating that the support that the housing authority received from the state was of a lesser degree than that of our federal properties.

565
00:59:33,577 --> 00:59:35,498
And the vast majority of our properties

566
00:59:37,198 --> 00:59:57,152
our federal, this project will transfer the subsidy for this from state to federal, which will allow the Housing Authority to affirmatively impact the lives of numerous individuals and families for many years to come.

567
00:59:59,354 --> 01:00:00,595
As far as the

568
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:11,364
The conclusion, my conclusion is to discuss that, and I think Hannah, was Hannah going to discuss the zoning aspect of it?

569
01:00:13,805 --> 01:00:16,346
I don't want to jump on your slide, Hannah.

570
01:00:22,222 --> 01:00:33,639
Jeff, I'm going to talk to the zoning at the end if you're done, but let me go through the conclusion on the local social and economic benefits, and then you can wrap up on the zoning.

571
01:00:33,679 --> 01:00:34,320
How's that sound?

572
01:00:34,841 --> 01:00:35,421
Okay, great.

573
01:00:35,862 --> 01:00:36,102
All right.

574
01:00:37,304 --> 01:00:45,086
As Gabe mentioned, and Lee also, we're preserving 144 existing deeply affordable units for low-income seniors and disabled individuals.

575
01:00:45,866 --> 01:00:54,549
Those units are not capable of providing adequate assistance and housing services to the individuals who are there at this point in time.

576
01:00:56,069 --> 01:01:04,154
The authority has attempted through the years with the limited funding to address the situation.

577
01:01:04,935 --> 01:01:09,898
The authority's walking court today is in a much better condition than it was just a few years ago.

578
01:01:10,478 --> 01:01:13,320
Still doesn't compare with our federally subsidized developments.

579
01:01:14,061 --> 01:01:16,702
Building 94 additional deeply affordable units.

580
01:01:17,463 --> 01:01:25,348
Again, this was stated by both Gabe and Lee in a transit rich community and within walking distance of the new Tufts Green Line stop.

581
01:01:26,409 --> 01:01:32,677
Providing a range of housing through the inclusion of elevator-accessible family units and smaller family units.

582
01:01:32,697 --> 01:01:35,941
This is something that Lee touched upon.

583
01:01:36,442 --> 01:01:40,267
In the housing industry, it is extraordinarily rare to find

584
01:01:41,408 --> 01:01:48,271
accessible units on the private market, never mind on a publicly subsidized market.

585
01:01:48,751 --> 01:01:54,434
And so this is in dire need of this being provided.

586
01:01:54,754 --> 01:02:00,777
And as Lee indicated, there is a building that will be elevated assistance

587
01:02:01,397 --> 01:02:21,874
for families, improving sustainability and resiliency to climate change, meeting state and city sustainability requirements in the enterprise green communities, and improving energy efficiency, ventilation, and HVAC, stormwater management, and removing hazardous materials on site.

588
01:02:22,995 --> 01:02:44,400
Let's step away from the engineering aspect of this and think about the impact that this has upon the quality of lives of the individuals who will be living in these units in comparison, in particular, to the folks who are presently living in the units that we're looking to transfer them into these new units.

589
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:47,421
The quality of life will improve significantly.

590
01:02:47,861 --> 01:02:50,522
In integrating Walkling Court site into the neighborhood,

591
01:02:51,942 --> 01:03:03,868
I've said from the very beginning that the Medford Housing Authority wants to be a good neighbor, and we have taken great strides, at least in my opinion, and those of our team.

592
01:03:04,288 --> 01:03:12,732
We've made great strides in attempting to take into consideration the comments and the input from the community, and I believe

593
01:03:14,093 --> 01:03:20,937
with the strongest belief I have that the designers have taken that into consideration with what you see tonight.

594
01:03:21,697 --> 01:03:33,384
And this has been done through the new street design which was stated was the recommendation and the requirement of the fire department, residential streetscapes, the landscaping, and the transition of density across the site.

595
01:03:33,704 --> 01:03:42,188
In addition to that we've had numerous discussions as far as the landscaping and in particular trying to save and maintain as

596
01:03:43,749 --> 01:03:46,632
as many of the trees as possible.

597
01:03:47,032 --> 01:03:50,956
What hasn't been mentioned, what hasn't been mentioned is the economic benefit.

598
01:03:51,557 --> 01:03:59,123
The fact that $166 million in local economic activity through the construction will generate or support

599
01:04:00,273 --> 01:04:02,555
up to 968 jobs.

600
01:04:02,875 --> 01:04:03,916
That's what we forecast.

601
01:04:04,536 --> 01:04:05,457
That's what we forecast.

602
01:04:05,497 --> 01:04:09,400
This is an economic vehicle for the city.

603
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:26,532
And with the participation of the city to this point, it has enabled the Housing Authority to receive millions of dollars projected and committed at this point from the state for us to be able to transition this.

604
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:29,335
In addition to that, Walkling Court

605
01:04:30,299 --> 01:04:36,309
is something that I envision the neighborhood and the community to be able to utilize.

606
01:04:36,990 --> 01:04:43,941
And so that we fully anticipate, and I've had communications with the mayor as recently as within a week or two,

607
01:04:45,371 --> 01:04:50,214
prior to this, that Walkling Court is a polling place at this point in time.

608
01:04:50,674 --> 01:04:59,940
It'll continue to be a polling place upon completion of construction, and it will be for the March 5th election that is coming up.

609
01:05:00,340 --> 01:05:11,627
But in addition to that, it's my hope that the facilities we have here, the community room that can be divided into two and hold up to or the vicinity between 150 and 200 people,

610
01:05:13,368 --> 01:05:20,330
can be something that can be utilized not only by the local neighborhood, but also by the community as a whole.

611
01:05:20,850 --> 01:05:26,671
So that aspect of being a good neighbor is extraordinarily important to me.

612
01:05:27,292 --> 01:05:32,053
And that is one of the reasons why the Housing Authority has had numerous meetings with the

613
01:05:33,373 --> 01:05:43,201
with the residents on site, with the neighbors, with every department in the city that has a say in this, and also some interest groups.

614
01:05:43,581 --> 01:05:58,953
So I'd like to just end on my aspect is on behalf of the Housing Authority as a whole, in our board of commissioners, our employees, our residents, our current residents, and for those individuals and families who will one day

615
01:05:59,613 --> 01:06:10,040
live in one of these apartments here at Walkling Court, I thank you for the opportunity to be before you tonight and ask you for your support.

616
01:06:11,181 --> 01:06:14,523
And I say thank you very much from the bottom of my heart.

617
01:06:19,146 --> 01:06:19,687
Thanks, Jeff.

618
01:06:21,596 --> 01:06:30,863
I will try to be brief, because as Lee alluded, we know that we've been in discussion with you for about the last hour and a half, and we want to leave room for questions.

619
01:06:32,485 --> 01:06:45,255
At this point, through the presentation, I do think that now the findings that the board needs to make in its site plan review process, the design team has really given you, I think, sufficient information to find

620
01:06:46,156 --> 01:07:00,534
that the project does not create any of the hazards or safety concerns relative to parking or vehicle usage, that the bulk location and height of the buildings

621
01:07:01,936 --> 01:07:09,359
are consistent with what's permitted under the PDD-3 in terms of the zoning, in terms of the density and the positioning.

622
01:07:09,939 --> 01:07:25,525
We submitted a preliminary site plan when the PDD-3 was approved and the site plan application and the plans provided to the board are consistent with that and therefore continue to be consistent with the PDD-3 approval.

623
01:07:26,785 --> 01:07:30,307
and all the dimensional requirements have been satisfied.

624
01:07:30,327 --> 01:07:51,417
And so at this point, I think we would like to open the floor for any questions from the board, as we do think that the information provided to the presentation will enable you to satisfy the seven findings that are required under the site plan review.

625
01:08:00,578 --> 01:08:07,883
Thank you so much, Attorney Kilson and Mr. Driscoll and the entire team of representatives of MHA.

626
01:08:07,903 --> 01:08:12,486
We appreciate you going through the details of this proposed project.

627
01:08:13,526 --> 01:08:18,169
I do, before I open it up to others, I have one clarifying question.

628
01:08:18,650 --> 01:08:20,551
We did not hear more about the noise.

629
01:08:20,711 --> 01:08:23,333
I want to make sure I didn't miss something on noise standards.

630
01:08:23,753 --> 01:08:29,657
And if there was previously, there was a concern with tenants being too close to

631
01:08:30,816 --> 01:08:37,300
a railroad or something like that, and I want to make sure that we have already accounted for that instance as far as noise.

632
01:08:40,442 --> 01:08:41,943
Noise as a nuisance, pretty much.

633
01:08:45,145 --> 01:08:51,589
So I can start with that, but I also think Lee, if you're on, Lee and Margaret can come in.

634
01:08:52,290 --> 01:08:53,511
In terms of the site plan,

635
01:08:55,512 --> 01:09:18,008
criteria, noise isn't specifically called out, but at this project for the property, for the building that abuts the railroad, it has been designed to ensure that it satisfies actually the HUD requirements relative to decibel levels inside each of the units.

636
01:09:18,288 --> 01:09:23,072
And Lee, maybe you can speak to the glass painting that we're utilizing and the insulation

637
01:09:23,890 --> 01:09:25,171
to meet those requirements.

638
01:09:26,451 --> 01:09:26,851
Absolutely.

639
01:09:27,132 --> 01:09:27,632
Thank you, Hannah.

640
01:09:28,512 --> 01:09:35,695
Yes, the windows and if actually if we could more equate a backup to just an overall site plan that might be helpful.

641
01:09:36,976 --> 01:09:37,476
Anyone will do.

642
01:09:38,516 --> 01:09:38,777
Beautiful.

643
01:09:40,349 --> 01:09:58,476
The windows and the walls that face, in this case, left on the screen in the senior building are, for lack of a more technical term, they're beefed up so that they can resist the sound coming in from the train as it passes by both the commuter rail and the Nor'easter on the commuter rail tracks.

644
01:09:59,936 --> 01:10:01,978
In particular, I have some samples behind me actually.

645
01:10:02,298 --> 01:10:09,204
In particular, the windows that we're using are a higher quality and higher weight window than you normally see in residential application.

646
01:10:10,085 --> 01:10:15,210
And the glass is actually a laminated glass to help resist the sound infiltrating through.

647
01:10:15,730 --> 01:10:18,913
The exterior wall itself is made of a durable cement board siding.

648
01:10:19,613 --> 01:10:26,760
with additional insulation and there's actually two layers of drywall on the inside of that wall to help resist the sound coming through.

649
01:10:26,780 --> 01:10:39,631
This is all as the result of recommendations by an acoustical engineer brought specifically onto the project to address the noise coming in from the railroad track side of the property.

650
01:10:40,872 --> 01:10:46,337
Additionally, the acoustical engineer gave us a wonderful review and feedback along the way

651
01:10:47,150 --> 01:11:01,683
from the very earliest stages of design, commenting even on the shape of the building back during feasibility study over a year ago, to help select a building shape that would not reverberate or make the sound worse as the train went by.

652
01:11:01,703 --> 01:11:13,073
And this is two things that it protects, it helps to protect the sound from the residents living in that building, but it also, because it's a six-story building, and as you can see, covers most of the property line adjacency,

653
01:11:13,533 --> 01:11:19,934
With the railroad tracks, that six-story building reflects the sound away for the rest of the site and helps protect the rest of the site as well.

654
01:11:22,815 --> 01:11:34,977
I do want to say that we are actually in discussion with the MBTA right now on logistics of additional sound mitigation, but that's still to be determined with the MBTA as far as site mitigation is concerned.

655
01:11:36,338 --> 01:11:36,738
Thank you.

656
01:11:36,818 --> 01:11:37,538
I appreciate it.

657
01:11:40,056 --> 01:11:47,580
And at this point, I do know that there was some feedback from the department heads, and I'm not sure if you've all had a chance to read those.

658
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:56,944
And so instead of going through them as the conditions, I'm going to open up to the board to see if the board has any clarifying questions prior to me opening up to the public.

659
01:11:58,124 --> 01:11:59,905
Does anyone from the board have questions?

660
01:12:04,667 --> 01:12:05,588
And I can't see.

661
01:12:06,419 --> 01:12:15,824
And if I can please ask, just so that we can see everyone, whoever is sharing the screen, if you can please stop sharing at this point.

662
01:12:19,986 --> 01:12:24,208
If there's any members of the board that have questions prior to opening it up to the public.

663
01:12:26,049 --> 01:12:27,469
Any clarifying questions?

664
01:12:27,489 --> 01:12:33,032
Okay, seeing none.

665
01:12:34,932 --> 01:12:39,999
This is a public hearing, so I will now open it up for public comment.

666
01:12:41,021 --> 01:12:45,768
Those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Danielle in the comments.

667
01:12:45,928 --> 01:12:48,812
You can also send an email to OCD at Medford-MA.gov.

668
01:12:50,891 --> 01:12:54,114
Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.

669
01:12:54,254 --> 01:13:01,280
A reminder to all meeting participants to please refrain from using the chat function to provide comments as it's not part of the public record.

670
01:13:01,861 --> 01:13:09,247
However, if a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, this may be entered into the chat to alert myself or staff.

671
01:13:10,188 --> 01:13:16,574
Danielle, can you please manage the public comment queue and read any previously sent emails or letters in the order in which you choose?

672
01:13:23,314 --> 01:13:26,097
I just unmuted Tom Lincoln.

673
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:29,740
Yes.

674
01:13:33,043 --> 01:13:34,064
Okay, I have the floor.

675
01:13:34,624 --> 01:13:35,645
My name is Tom Lincoln.

676
01:13:35,665 --> 01:13:37,227
I live at 27 Gleason Street.

677
01:13:37,287 --> 01:13:45,234
I'm here with Sue Gerald from trees Medford regarding tree mitigation for the.

678
01:13:47,341 --> 01:13:49,162
walk-in court redevelopment.

679
01:13:50,123 --> 01:13:58,007
We sent the board and Danielle our proposal and a letter on January 8th.

680
01:13:58,167 --> 01:13:59,468
So you've had it for about a month.

681
01:14:00,309 --> 01:14:05,132
We also had a fruitful discussion actually yesterday with the Medford Housing Authority.

682
01:14:06,072 --> 01:14:16,058
Basically our concern is that in removing 30 mature trees the project while having

683
01:14:16,642 --> 01:14:23,247
many, many other wonderful environmental benefits will result in a deficit on tree canopy.

684
01:14:23,547 --> 01:14:29,331
And it's the stated policy of the city of Medford to protect our tree canopy.

685
01:14:30,211 --> 01:14:42,060
If you've lived in Medford for any amount of time, you know, trees have been a perennial, make a bad pun here, a perennial issue, something that the city

686
01:14:43,383 --> 01:15:02,017
at least in my opinion and opinion of many others has struggled with making some progress, but certainly in the context of general aesthetics and environment, as well as climate change and resiliency, something that we really need to ramp up here.

687
01:15:02,938 --> 01:15:09,543
So what we concluded and discussed with the Medford Housing Authority yesterday using

688
01:15:12,118 --> 01:15:19,564
really a methodology that is perfectly sensible and based entirely on information received from the Medford Housing Authority.

689
01:15:20,385 --> 01:15:28,931
We concluded that and are requesting that a condition be added to permission and we will also do this at the Medford City Council.

690
01:15:29,652 --> 01:15:30,733
I'm not sure exactly of the

691
01:15:32,885 --> 01:15:44,955
formalities here in this situation, that a mitigation payment be made into a tree fund to fund additional tree plantings outside the site.

692
01:15:45,416 --> 01:15:54,203
We have proposed two amounts based on two different logical ways of calculating this of $90,000 and change and $108,000 and change.

693
01:15:57,279 --> 01:16:07,581
The Housing Authority in the discussion yesterday committed to a payment of $50,000 towards this purpose.

694
01:16:07,881 --> 01:16:10,242
And so we think that's a wonderful starting point.

695
01:16:11,082 --> 01:16:19,383
I really appreciate their interest in serving the broader community interests and environmental interests here in the city of Medford.

696
01:16:19,724 --> 01:16:21,964
So we want to be sure that that is part of your

697
01:16:22,964 --> 01:16:32,631
consideration of the permit, and we're certainly will be pursuing the same tactic at the Medford City Council on February 20th.

698
01:16:33,512 --> 01:16:52,105
One last thing here, this basically, as far as we can tell, basically pays for about half of what is needed to make up the deficit in tree size, tree girth, tree diameter, I guess is the right word, excuse me,

699
01:16:53,217 --> 01:17:08,450
And so we will be pursuing with the city and in cooperation with the Medford Housing Authority for our discussion yesterday, other sources to make up the difference between $50,000 and what is needed for full mitigation.

700
01:17:09,089 --> 01:17:12,271
So I wanna be sure that that is on the record here.

701
01:17:12,891 --> 01:17:13,031
Yeah.

702
01:17:13,072 --> 01:17:20,536
Sorry, I don't mean to cut you off, but I wanna make sure that everyone is limited and able to get through with their comment.

703
01:17:20,676 --> 01:17:25,239
Okay, so I just wanna be sure this happens because it already has happened.

704
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:26,480
Thank you.

705
01:17:35,926 --> 01:17:37,547
The next speaker I have is Ken Kraus.

706
01:17:39,662 --> 01:17:40,062
Thank you.

707
01:17:40,522 --> 01:17:41,722
My name is Ken Krause.

708
01:17:41,782 --> 01:17:49,744
I live at 50 Mystic Street, about four blocks from the site, albeit on the other side of the river and Mystic Valley Parkway.

709
01:17:50,104 --> 01:17:55,165
I just wanted to express my 100% support for this project.

710
01:17:56,085 --> 01:18:04,286
I feel it's 40 years overdue, badly needed, particularly in terms of accessibility improvements.

711
01:18:04,946 --> 01:18:07,947
I feel it's been carefully designed and a lot of

712
01:18:09,512 --> 01:18:13,196
consideration has been given to input from the community.

713
01:18:13,236 --> 01:18:14,237
And I thank you for that.

714
01:18:14,257 --> 01:18:24,868
I'm very excited that the family units are part of the proposal, because I think that's an urgently needed aspect of housing in Medford.

715
01:18:24,908 --> 01:18:30,354
And it's also going to add some vibrancy to this site that I think is very exciting to see in the future.

716
01:18:31,415 --> 01:18:35,599
I didn't see the whole presentation, but I had a couple of other observations.

717
01:18:35,759 --> 01:18:40,904
One, I did hear that 153 parking spaces was a little higher than required.

718
01:18:41,025 --> 01:18:50,394
I was kind of curious why they felt that was necessary given the nature of the people that will be living here and probably not a big parking driving demand.

719
01:18:50,414 --> 01:18:54,818
I also didn't see, and I hope there's bicycle parking,

720
01:18:55,018 --> 01:18:57,662
included, both for residents and visitors.

721
01:18:58,383 --> 01:19:02,648
Also hope that the community center will continue to be part of this.

722
01:19:02,708 --> 01:19:08,515
I heard a mention that this voting place and there is a community center now, as was mentioned at the beginning.

723
01:19:10,235 --> 01:19:25,246
And then last, I'd just like to encourage the city to continue to improve the pedestrian network in the vicinity of the complex because it's badly lacking, particularly along the Mystic River on the Auburn Street side.

724
01:19:25,506 --> 01:19:35,354
And in terms of accessibility, while it's nice to have the West Medford commuter rail station there, it's useless now because it's not handicap accessible at all.

725
01:19:35,394 --> 01:19:35,794
So if you're

726
01:19:37,495 --> 01:19:40,418
have accessibility needs or in a wheelchair, you can't use the train.

727
01:19:40,458 --> 01:19:51,608
So hopefully there'll be continued effort to improve the accessibility of the train station there and other accommodations in the vicinity so people can get to the many other destinations nearby.

728
01:19:51,708 --> 01:19:58,174
So those are my comments and I urge the board to approve the project as presented.

729
01:19:58,254 --> 01:19:58,574
Thank you.

730
01:19:58,594 --> 01:20:00,876
Thank you, Mr. Krause.

731
01:20:06,053 --> 01:20:08,434
Next person is Teresa DuPont.

732
01:20:08,454 --> 01:20:10,655
Hi everybody.

733
01:20:10,935 --> 01:20:13,215
As Daniel mentioned, my name is Teresa DuPont.

734
01:20:13,515 --> 01:20:27,040
I am the Community Preservation Act Coordinator here in the City of Medford, and what that means is I help support the Community Preservation Committee that helps award funding to various projects.

735
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:35,047
I'm here to speak on behalf of the CPC in support of this project, and we've put our money where our mouth is here.

736
01:20:36,007 --> 01:20:43,434
We've had the opportunity to not once, twice, but actually three times help support Walkling Court in their pre-development costs.

737
01:20:44,991 --> 01:20:51,313
CPA is super focused on affordable housing, supporting it, generating it here in the city.

738
01:20:53,094 --> 01:20:57,135
And we're happy to have helped bring it to this point.

739
01:20:57,555 --> 01:21:04,317
And I'm excited to hear that we're going to be able to welcome 94 more families into the Medford community.

740
01:21:04,497 --> 01:21:09,919
So again, I just wanted to speak in support of this application.

741
01:21:10,079 --> 01:21:10,439
Thank you.

742
01:21:12,140 --> 01:21:13,060
Thank you, Mr. Pugh.

743
01:21:22,197 --> 01:21:23,758
I don't see any other hands raised.

744
01:21:23,818 --> 01:21:26,198
Daniel, do you have public comments to read?

745
01:21:26,218 --> 01:21:37,422
We did receive two emails that came in since I had sent out the packets with the other public comment.

746
01:21:41,024 --> 01:21:44,145
We have a email from

747
01:21:45,509 --> 01:21:46,710
from Susan's rod.

748
01:22:02,102 --> 01:22:04,023
I tutored a sick elderly immigrant there.

749
01:22:04,483 --> 01:22:06,124
She couldn't manage without an elevator.

750
01:22:06,524 --> 01:22:07,944
Don't listen to the NIMBY Neighbors.

751
01:22:08,044 --> 01:22:09,805
It's a beautiful project, long overdue.

752
01:22:10,185 --> 01:22:17,748
Complaints about six stories being too tall are laughable, especially when one looks at the extra floors being put on Riverside Ave or New York City.

753
01:22:17,888 --> 01:22:18,289
Thank you.

754
01:22:18,929 --> 01:22:22,690
Susan Gerard, long-term Medford resident, 26 Farragut Ave, Medford.

755
01:22:25,431 --> 01:22:28,833
And then I have one from William Navarre.

756
01:22:31,850 --> 01:22:34,191
We live at 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

757
01:22:34,271 --> 01:22:35,751
I support the walk and court project.

758
01:22:35,791 --> 01:22:38,872
I think it's good and that there'll be more housing for people to live here in Medford.

759
01:22:39,953 --> 01:22:42,454
Even good if families can live in Medford.

760
01:22:42,774 --> 01:22:45,555
It's also okay if there are taller buildings than there were before.

761
01:22:45,955 --> 01:22:49,176
Our cities became more desirable and prosperous than they were in the past.

762
01:22:53,277 --> 01:22:55,558
And those are the ones that I saw in the inbox.

763
01:23:01,895 --> 01:23:04,057
I don't see any other raised hands.

764
01:23:07,981 --> 01:23:21,073
Okay, seeing none, I'm going to close the public comments portion and ask the board again if there's any other information that they want to have clarified.

765
01:23:22,327 --> 01:23:23,268
before deliberation?

766
01:23:23,888 --> 01:23:33,976
Jackie, I just want to, as part of the public comment for the record, you do have the, to acknowledge that you guys received the letter from Therese Medford, you've reviewed it.

767
01:23:34,116 --> 01:23:35,597
I just thought we should confirm that.

768
01:23:35,997 --> 01:23:39,620
And then there was a paper letter that was dropped off today and scanned in.

769
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:46,605
So it was in your packet that I wanted to confirm also for the public record that you have that.

770
01:23:47,726 --> 01:23:48,387
Thank you, Alicia.

771
01:23:48,407 --> 01:23:49,167
I appreciate that.

772
01:23:51,119 --> 01:23:57,505
I've been remiss on the actual public comments, but I'm hoping that from your end, you can share that information.

773
01:23:57,525 --> 01:23:59,407
Okay.

774
01:24:00,227 --> 01:24:07,374
So there was also a previous email that was received several days ago.

775
01:24:09,776 --> 01:24:13,219
Sorry, it's forwarded by one of our staff, so I was just reviewing that.

776
01:24:16,356 --> 01:24:17,397
January 24th.

777
01:24:18,578 --> 01:24:19,859
Do we want I haven't read it.

778
01:24:19,959 --> 01:24:23,142
This one goes on for five pages, four or five pages.

779
01:24:23,163 --> 01:24:26,706
So I'm not sure that we can read the whole thing rather summarize.

780
01:24:28,548 --> 01:24:29,909
And then there was the one that

781
01:24:32,761 --> 01:24:37,945
I don't know if Danielle, if you were, sorry, I had them open, there we go.

782
01:24:38,506 --> 01:24:40,728
I'm afraid of mispronouncing her last name.

783
01:24:41,228 --> 01:24:50,576
Marianne Andonucci submitted a paper letter today that we scanned in and provided to the board.

784
01:24:50,716 --> 01:24:54,239
It also goes on for two and a half pages.

785
01:24:54,719 --> 01:24:57,201
Do you want us to read the whole thing for the record?

786
01:24:58,263 --> 01:24:59,447
What is the legality of it?

787
01:24:59,467 --> 01:25:01,675
Do you have to acknowledge it or read the entire?

788
01:25:05,070 --> 01:25:06,851
Summarize it, Ms.

789
01:25:06,931 --> 01:25:16,178
Antonucci requested that you reread her letter that she submitted previously with all of her concerns for the previous public hearing.

790
01:25:16,858 --> 01:25:17,959
She was reiterating them.

791
01:25:18,419 --> 01:25:22,522
She had concerns about how the traffic study was conducted.

792
01:25:22,842 --> 01:25:30,167
She felt that it wasn't a long enough traffic study, that it was only conducted during weekdays and not on the weekend.

793
01:25:32,572 --> 01:25:35,393
And sorry, I'm skimming and reading.

794
01:25:37,114 --> 01:25:43,877
She is very concerned that the residents in the neighborhood haven't been heard, that the design doesn't reflect that.

795
01:25:45,877 --> 01:25:58,362
She again does not like that the design has people facing train tracks and buildings, and that that's what they're gonna be looking at, the industrial buildings.

796
01:26:01,205 --> 01:26:13,314
and she's concerned about the additional traffic impacts on the neighborhood, and she was concerned about the shadows that are planned that the six-story building would cast on the abutting residential neighborhood.

797
01:26:13,334 --> 01:26:16,316
Again, I'm only repeating what she said.

798
01:26:16,336 --> 01:26:20,799
There was no way to... And then the...

799
01:26:23,011 --> 01:26:34,311
the connecting street, there was some concern about fire truck access, and she felt there wasn't space for the fire truck.

800
01:26:35,813 --> 01:26:53,658
in addition to passenger vehicles, and that there are large 18-wheel trucks that come down North Street, and that there's a steep incline of North Street, and that a fully loaded 18-wheel truck would have trouble stopping at the bottom where people are crossing the street.

801
01:26:54,897 --> 01:26:59,420
And so she asks that you not approve the development.

802
01:27:01,061 --> 01:27:07,386
I'm hoping that if anybody feels I haven't summarized that pretty well.

803
01:27:08,226 --> 01:27:17,513
This is not to negate any kind of concerns or anything, but as far as not having enough space for a fire truck, I am sure at this point the fire chief would have

804
01:27:19,234 --> 01:27:20,675
address that at this point.

805
01:27:20,835 --> 01:27:25,598
So I would look to the city to make sure that that was handled.

806
01:27:25,859 --> 01:27:30,562
And then the traffic engineer for the traffic study has accepted the traffic study with conditions.

807
01:27:33,184 --> 01:27:42,090
As far as the height, the whole idea of it being a zoning amendment was to accommodate the project for a path forward.

808
01:27:42,110 --> 01:27:45,612
So I'm not sure how to address the comments.

809
01:27:47,457 --> 01:27:49,638
going forward if they've been sufficiently covered.

810
01:27:50,199 --> 01:27:50,339
Right.

811
01:27:50,479 --> 01:27:53,040
And you don't need to respond to public comments.

812
01:27:53,060 --> 01:27:54,801
You only need to hear them.

813
01:27:55,301 --> 01:27:56,482
You don't need to respond to them.

814
01:27:56,562 --> 01:28:11,010
I just, I don't want the public to think that we're not taking their concerns into question, but I'm just trying to highlight that these are things that have been fully vetted and addressed by city officials and Method House and in their team.

815
01:28:11,030 --> 01:28:11,450
Yeah.

816
01:28:15,557 --> 01:28:16,177
I agree with you.

817
01:28:16,197 --> 01:28:24,402
I refrained from actually commenting as I read the letter, but I agree many of those were addressed by the team.

818
01:28:28,505 --> 01:28:31,767
And did you have anything else that you wanted to highlight?

819
01:28:32,967 --> 01:28:38,130
The other letter came in a week or two ago, so I'm assuming the board had a chance to see it.

820
01:28:40,579 --> 01:29:00,911
And it's primarily about building heights and traffic issues, concerns about increased traffic, increased about the shadows again, which I mean, we saw from the shadow studies, but the resident was concerned and increased traffic in the area was concerned.

821
01:29:03,632 --> 01:29:05,453
Personal attacks on staff members.

822
01:29:05,473 --> 01:29:07,875
So I'm choosing not to actually read that.

823
01:29:07,955 --> 01:29:09,816
I don't think we need to read those out loud.

824
01:29:13,886 --> 01:29:20,770
Making sure there's sufficient traffic calming was the big concern in that section.

825
01:29:22,451 --> 01:29:28,755
She did not like the community meetings, but again, that's not what you're looking at in the state plan review.

826
01:29:31,217 --> 01:29:35,720
So that generally summarized.

827
01:29:36,978 --> 01:29:40,642
And that letter, the housing authority saw in advance as well.

828
01:29:40,862 --> 01:29:43,725
It was provided to them because it came in early enough for them to see it.

829
01:29:46,728 --> 01:29:57,620
At this point, I would, if Medford Housing or any of its representatives would like to touch upon any of the concerns that have been placed before them, they're more than welcome to.

830
01:29:57,640 --> 01:29:59,001
I personally don't

831
01:29:59,784 --> 01:30:02,687
find it necessary because it has been presented in detail.

832
01:30:03,328 --> 01:30:08,994
And then following up with the conditions, I think that will cover most of the other concerns.

833
01:30:09,895 --> 01:30:11,217
But I'm going to leave that up to my fellow.

834
01:30:18,282 --> 01:30:29,355
Madam Chair, I think that we would agree that all of the concerns that were raised in the public comment we have, we've addressed in the site plan application and in the presentation done today.

835
01:30:31,258 --> 01:30:35,162
So, I think the only question, it may be the question of biking.

836
01:30:35,863 --> 01:30:42,606
There was a question made about providing centrifugal biking, and maybe you can speak to that.

837
01:30:42,626 --> 01:30:48,949
I think we advised people before about that there will continue to be a community center as a component of the project.

838
01:30:50,790 --> 01:30:55,272
And Lee can speak to the biking net spaces that's being provided.

839
01:30:57,051 --> 01:30:58,933
Thank you, Anna, and thank you Madam Chair.

840
01:30:59,833 --> 01:31:05,157
Yes, we are accommodating bikes on site and within the senior building.

841
01:31:06,298 --> 01:31:15,305
Within the senior building, in the podium level of the parking on the first floor, there's an enclosed bike storage area for residents to use to encourage

842
01:31:16,630 --> 01:31:45,835
uh bike transportation and also to reduce the the need of cars hopefully but it is a substantial amenity it's a locked bike storage facility within the senior building similarly on site next to the proposed family apartment building there's also a bike rack there as well and so there's encouragement for for bike use throughout the site as well as as we discussed earlier best practices for site development for safe streets so that biking would be accommodated there

843
01:31:47,056 --> 01:31:55,248
In regard to the community center, we didn't really get much into the actual insides of the architecture today, but facing.

844
01:31:56,145 --> 01:32:08,393
Walkland Court, as you come in, that view as you come in from the Auburn Street past the townhouses and facing the Bain Senior Building, the very first thing you're met with is the community center on the first floor.

845
01:32:08,473 --> 01:32:17,098
It is the front door of the new senior building and it is at the center and the heart of the community at Walkland Court.

846
01:32:17,798 --> 01:32:29,431
And it features both the offices, the administrative offices for the Housing Authority for Walkland Court and also for the family buildings, but it also has a multi-use community room.

847
01:32:29,671 --> 01:32:38,481
And I think it was Jeff that mentioned that that community room is actually flexible and can be divided in two to accommodate either voting as a polling place, it can be opened up for the entire

848
01:32:40,503 --> 01:32:45,107
building for large events for bingo night or whatever it may be.

849
01:32:45,628 --> 01:32:55,858
But that community room is directly accessible from the exterior, as well as securely through the building, and is meant as a resource for the building and the community as a whole.

850
01:32:56,378 --> 01:33:01,083
And it's also directly adjacent to an outdoor patio space that it spills out onto.

851
01:33:01,563 --> 01:33:12,788
And so this is really meant to be the heart of the neighborhood and something that not only the residents can pull on, but the neighborhood can feel connected to.

852
01:33:12,808 --> 01:33:18,590
Thank you.

853
01:33:22,472 --> 01:33:29,455
So again, at this time, I am going to open up to the board again for clarifying comments and deliberation.

854
01:33:32,547 --> 01:33:35,330
Ari, I had seen your hand raised first.

855
01:33:38,292 --> 01:33:39,573
Do you want to go ahead and speak, Ari?

856
01:33:40,674 --> 01:33:40,975
Sure.

857
01:33:40,995 --> 01:33:49,102
It was a clarification question that arose during the public comment about traffic that

858
01:33:50,492 --> 01:34:00,038
The presentation of the traffic study said that no additional traffic calming measures were suggested beyond the plateau tables on the street.

859
01:34:00,539 --> 01:34:02,059
Can you just clarify those?

860
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:03,761
There's more than one of those.

861
01:34:03,841 --> 01:34:07,523
They're spaced evenly throughout the complex, correct?

862
01:34:15,771 --> 01:34:16,272
Yes, thank you.

863
01:34:17,192 --> 01:34:33,462
I can also bring Brian in, but the basic design is there's a raised table cross at the center of where the road bends, and then also there are raised sidewalks and raised crosswalks, excuse me, at either end as you come in.

864
01:34:33,603 --> 01:34:43,089
So those are elements within the traffic calming as well as the apron that we talked about that you drive over to get in and the narrowing of the street.

865
01:34:43,769 --> 01:34:45,130
Brian, did I represent that accurately?

866
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:56,263
Yeah, but I just want to note the reference to the no traffic calming measures in the traffic study is in reference to on the adjacent roadways, not the site itself.

867
01:34:58,103 --> 01:35:04,425
So there's traffic calming measures on site, but we're planning no infrastructure modifications in the roadways.

868
01:35:05,665 --> 01:35:05,985
Thank you.

869
01:35:07,225 --> 01:35:08,406
Thank you for the clarification.

870
01:35:08,986 --> 01:35:09,486
No problem.

871
01:35:11,926 --> 01:35:13,307
If I may, through the chair,

872
01:35:15,347 --> 01:35:43,871
The Director of Traffic and Transportation recommended some pedestrian safety improvements at the intersection of Route 16 and Auburn Street, which included replacing the pedestrian signal heads that are missing and to upgrade the ones that don't have the countdowns, to upgrade those to include the countdown, and also to put pedestrian warning signage at that free right turn when traveling on Route 16.

873
01:35:44,979 --> 01:35:56,682
route 16 on to Auburn Street, and also to paint some yield striping or however, whatever the appropriate treatment is.

874
01:36:01,344 --> 01:36:05,505
Just to clarify that there will be some mitigation there.

875
01:36:11,626 --> 01:36:12,567
Yes, thank you, Daniel.

876
01:36:14,938 --> 01:36:32,834
I was actually, my question was when I heard that there was not going to be a proposal in traffic mitigation, that's what I want to go back and want to know what the proponent had, if you had had a chance to read the department head comments, or if that was something that we were going to collectively do at the end with conditions, if there was approval.

877
01:36:33,995 --> 01:36:40,680
But there are a significant amount of conditions that we'll have to go over prior to us being able to

878
01:36:41,801 --> 01:36:46,844
approved site plan or recommend to the city council for a special permit at this point.

879
01:36:47,064 --> 01:37:06,293
And hearing no other comments from the board, I do know, and based on my review and based on confirmation from the city, the plans have not changed based on what was adopted and recommended by the CDB board, by the city council previously.

880
01:37:06,814 --> 01:37:10,956
So at this point, if we did want to approve, I'm guessing

881
01:37:12,611 --> 01:37:15,393
we would be looking at the conditions as presented.

882
01:37:16,933 --> 01:37:37,444
And if Danielle, I know that in lieu of saying comply with this person's memo dated X or that person's memo, if you can neatly collect them and pretty much go down the line for us so we're all on the same page and understand what those conditions are before the proponent.

883
01:37:39,686 --> 01:37:39,946
Yes.

884
01:37:42,158 --> 01:37:56,725
So I tried to kind of parse these out, also weighing some of the recommendations versus requirements and what would be appropriate for this project.

885
01:37:58,126 --> 01:38:02,808
So the, I'm wondering, should I share the screen so these are visible?

886
01:38:03,628 --> 01:38:05,509
Or what do you prefer?

887
01:38:05,609 --> 01:38:07,170
Yes, that would be helpful.

888
01:38:21,171 --> 01:38:22,431
Hey, is this too small?

889
01:38:22,451 --> 01:38:23,552
Should I make it one page?

890
01:38:29,693 --> 01:38:29,953
Yes.

891
01:38:30,993 --> 01:38:32,574
You couldn't see us nodding our heads.

892
01:38:34,474 --> 01:38:35,694
I don't know how to do that.

893
01:38:35,714 --> 01:38:38,815
Why does it want to do that?

894
01:38:38,835 --> 01:38:39,155
Here we go.

895
01:38:46,810 --> 01:38:57,599
So some of this is like the boilerplate, you know, we'll put in the control plans, whether not to be modified, that has to be recorded.

896
01:38:57,619 --> 01:39:11,851
So for the meat of the condition, so traffic and transportation conditions, so in coordination with the director of traffic and transportation and subject to DCR approval, because Route 16 is a DCR road, so,

897
01:39:16,139 --> 01:39:18,762
In the end, it comes down to whether DCR will allow it.

898
01:39:21,646 --> 01:39:29,415
The applicant shall add and incorporate into phasing any missing pedestrian signal heads buttons at the signalized approaches at the intersection of Route 16 and Auburn Street.

899
01:39:30,016 --> 01:39:34,521
The applicant shall upgrade non-countdown pedestrian signal heads to countdown type heads.

900
01:39:36,940 --> 01:39:41,563
The second traffic condition is in coordination with the director of traffic and transportation.

901
01:39:41,583 --> 01:39:51,928
So to DCR approval, the applicant shall add pedestrian warning signage on the un-signalized approaches to the intersection, free right turn from Route 16 to Auburn Street, and yield markings prior to the crosswalk.

902
01:39:52,569 --> 01:39:57,451
And pedestrian warning signage is essentially, it could be just a sign,

903
01:39:59,738 --> 01:40:12,468
just a standard aluminum sign that has some kind of warning, or it could be in conjunction with those standing signs that you see in crosswalks that if you hit it, it flings back.

904
01:40:12,848 --> 01:40:16,691
It kind of slows people down and alerts you that folks could be crossing there.

905
01:40:17,752 --> 01:40:20,074
So little treatments like that could really

906
01:40:21,580 --> 01:40:23,120
help the pedestrian experience there.

907
01:40:23,880 --> 01:40:26,041
And then for the engineering division conditions.

908
01:40:26,901 --> 01:40:28,681
Some of these might have been addressed.

909
01:40:30,262 --> 01:40:35,823
Since these were drafted by the city engineer.

910
01:40:37,263 --> 01:40:39,964
Most of these are requirements.

911
01:40:42,124 --> 01:40:44,085
So there's engineering directive number three.

912
01:40:46,549 --> 01:40:58,936
that all the existing concrete curbing be replaced with granite curbing and that the curbing and sidewalk between the development and Auburn Street would be realigned.

913
01:40:59,857 --> 01:41:13,185
So the walking core and then there's like a gap and then it's the public street that all be aligned to be one cohesive sidewalk system that's all been replaced.

914
01:41:15,213 --> 01:41:40,022
And then several of these are about revising the modeling for the stormwater drainage system, just to confirm pipe sizing, updates to plan sets to show that sewer and stormwater piping crossing locations have the correct separation of six inches, that the water quality structures are sized appropriately, that roof drains,

915
01:41:42,712 --> 01:41:46,754
you know, direct to infiltration systems and that they're sized appropriately.

916
01:41:48,095 --> 01:41:52,037
Fire services shall be triple gated to allow individual building isolation.

917
01:41:54,838 --> 01:42:03,643
There was a request to change the water main materials.

918
01:42:03,763 --> 01:42:06,764
It was shown to be concrete

919
01:42:09,637 --> 01:42:17,802
concrete encased or something like that I'm not the engineer, but it's the water main shall be encapsulated in a polyethylene casement in accordance with city standards.

920
01:42:18,703 --> 01:42:23,825
Basically, the things that the city engineer picked up I see Jose has raised his hand.

921
01:42:25,787 --> 01:42:26,727
Shall I unmute him.

922
01:42:27,267 --> 01:42:27,948
Yes.

923
01:42:28,588 --> 01:42:28,828
Okay.

924
01:42:33,357 --> 01:42:33,617
Okay.

925
01:42:34,158 --> 01:42:34,858
Can you guys hear me?

926
01:42:36,299 --> 01:42:36,520
Yeah.

927
01:42:36,600 --> 01:42:37,260
Thank you, Daniel.

928
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:49,830
So I thought that it would like, um, helpful to mention that, um, um, or when I'm sitting in here has been pretty, you know, helpful and like, we've worked together with him.

929
01:42:50,631 --> 01:42:52,872
Um, and there is an email from Owen.

930
01:42:53,793 --> 01:43:00,078
Um, he sent to us, um, yesterday, um, when we had the last call with him, he said that he was going to be reaching to you, Daniel.

931
01:43:01,019 --> 01:43:02,140
I'm not really sure if he did.

932
01:43:03,352 --> 01:43:30,042
to let you know that we have met the engineering division conditions with our latest review or revisions of the plan set and our response to comments letter and that the engineering division will do one last review of the entire, you know, stormwater and plans once we are submitting for building permits application, but that will be like a separate kind of like review from this.

933
01:43:32,231 --> 01:43:37,776
So I'm not sure if he has reached out to you, but, um, I do know that's what, um, he, he told me on an email.

934
01:43:38,937 --> 01:43:39,258
Oh yeah.

935
01:43:39,298 --> 01:43:41,019
Cause I did send these to him.

936
01:43:41,039 --> 01:43:45,984
Um, but that was, um, this morning.

937
01:43:46,204 --> 01:43:51,609
So, but I think if you guys were communicating yesterday, today, then yeah, that's probably what happened.

938
01:43:51,969 --> 01:43:52,130
Yeah.

939
01:43:52,670 --> 01:43:57,014
So if you're complying with these, then it doesn't matter because it's, you're complying.

940
01:43:57,034 --> 01:43:57,495
Okay.

941
01:44:01,695 --> 01:44:07,804
So we can skip down so there's the fire department conditions, which are, I have not put them in here, but it'd be what the.

942
01:44:09,547 --> 01:44:12,832
The letter stated, which are all pretty standard, the health department.

943
01:44:14,034 --> 01:44:15,116
And these are all in the.

944
01:44:16,592 --> 01:44:26,434
the file, the online file, if any folks want to look at the comments and read them themselves, they are available along with all the public comment.

945
01:44:27,074 --> 01:44:42,818
And then one of the miscellaneous conditions is regarding a payment to a tree fund and the amount of $50,000 for the purpose of purchasing and installing public trees throughout the city.

946
01:44:46,785 --> 01:44:57,589
I believe that encapsulates the agreement between the housing authority and the meeting yesterday with Therese Medford.

947
01:45:00,070 --> 01:45:14,977
I don't know if there is an established fund, so I left it kind of vague, but we can make it more specific, or we can leave this for the special permit decision condition as a recommendation for the city council to put as a condition.

948
01:45:17,427 --> 01:45:19,928
I think it could live on either decision.

949
01:45:20,428 --> 01:45:33,093
Since these are the conditions for the site plan approval, where you're the site plan review authority, and then you'll be recommending you board at the city council's action for the special permit.

950
01:45:33,613 --> 01:45:44,197
And you could sever this from this decision if we're not positive on how that one should be written.

951
01:45:46,033 --> 01:45:47,855
since it was just hashed out yesterday.

952
01:45:51,739 --> 01:46:07,117
And then for the historical commission conditions, there is a letter and it has to do with, let me find it.

953
01:46:13,998 --> 01:46:16,358
They have a letter dated August 29th, 2023.

954
01:46:16,418 --> 01:46:17,499
Are there any other questions?

955
01:46:17,519 --> 01:46:37,142
I thought I saw a hand raised.

956
01:46:43,787 --> 01:46:44,440
Mr. Driscoll?

957
01:46:51,960 --> 01:47:02,288
Yes, Danielle, as far as the $50,000 to the city, the Housing Authority has agreed with the folks we met with yesterday to make that payment.

958
01:47:02,728 --> 01:47:09,233
The only question I would have is, does that payment go to the city or does it go to another organization?

959
01:47:09,293 --> 01:47:15,498
But I think it was pretty clear, though, the Housing Authority's willingness, as I said earlier, to be a good neighbor.

960
01:47:16,318 --> 01:47:18,379
and contribute that $50,000.

961
01:47:20,641 --> 01:47:31,286
What I don't think is part of the miscellaneous conditions is that we agree to continue to work with them to see if there's additional funding available.

962
01:47:31,306 --> 01:47:33,127
I don't know that Mr. Lincoln mentioned that.

963
01:47:34,268 --> 01:47:50,579
Um, I would think that, um, in having met with all of the, uh, the city departments, we've tried to address all the concerns and I would be hesitant to, to not also address the issue of the trees in this, if that's to be included.

964
01:47:58,517 --> 01:47:59,177
Madam chair.

965
01:47:59,378 --> 01:48:00,859
I see Alicia has her hand raised.

966
01:48:01,299 --> 01:48:05,081
Yes, I can just address the question about the fund and money.

967
01:48:05,922 --> 01:48:14,767
So it is the intention of the city and the city council to create a tree fund as part of the creation of the tree ordinance that the council is working on.

968
01:48:15,588 --> 01:48:20,931
And I did actually have the opportunity to speak with the city council president earlier today.

969
01:48:21,756 --> 01:48:32,020
And we can either move forward more quickly on literally just a creation of the tree fund so that it exists as an entity.

970
01:48:32,401 --> 01:48:33,861
It would not be separate from the city.

971
01:48:34,241 --> 01:48:38,443
It would be a check made out to the city of Medford for the tree fund.

972
01:48:38,623 --> 01:48:49,588
And then it would only be deposited into that fund, which will be set up as what is typically referred to as a revolving account for tree purposes.

973
01:48:50,888 --> 01:49:00,051
that it's our intention as part of the ordinance, but we can fast track the fund piece in order to move everything forward more quickly.

974
01:49:06,233 --> 01:49:09,694
Meaning if we were to decide on it as part of the site plan review?

975
01:49:10,763 --> 01:49:37,370
Right, if the CD board wanted to make that one of, so I would say that they could either be a requirement here or it could be a requirement at the city council special permit granting stage, but we would move forward with setting up a tree fund sooner rather than later if there were monies to deposit in that fund sooner rather than later.

976
01:49:39,826 --> 01:49:45,932
Is there a reason that this condition isn't to be satisfied prior to the issuance of the building permit?

977
01:49:46,732 --> 01:49:48,134
That would be my expectation.

978
01:49:48,154 --> 01:49:55,680
All of our conditions with site plan review would be prior to the issuance of the building permit.

979
01:49:58,859 --> 01:50:07,205
The tree ordinance, it could be approved in a month or it could take us six more months.

980
01:50:07,545 --> 01:50:10,927
We've been working through various details on it.

981
01:50:12,308 --> 01:50:17,051
And I would absolutely not allow that technicality to hold up this project.

982
01:50:17,112 --> 01:50:18,893
We would figure that out.

983
01:50:19,613 --> 01:50:26,518
At the very least, the city could hold it in internal escrow until the fund was set up.

984
01:50:28,237 --> 01:50:42,337
That would be our expectation that that would work to have it as a condition of issuing the building permit and then that we would be in a fund that the city would establish and maybe adjusted when the ordinance is enacted.

985
01:50:44,565 --> 01:50:46,467
Are you suggesting adjust the amount?

986
01:50:46,987 --> 01:51:03,303
No, I'm just suggesting that your fund may be different from what we, you know, at the time that the building permit is issued, the fund into which those funds are deposited may change once you actually establish the ordinance and establish the fund under the ordinance.

987
01:51:04,045 --> 01:51:04,185
right?

988
01:51:04,325 --> 01:51:09,290
And so it seems to me that if the language, uh, yes.

989
01:51:09,931 --> 01:51:17,197
So a statement that contribute 50,000 in the city for the dedicated purposes of purchasing installing public trees throughout the city.

990
01:51:17,898 --> 01:51:20,861
Um, the fund may have mildly broader uses than that.

991
01:51:21,001 --> 01:51:23,283
It may be used to, uh, um,

992
01:51:27,528 --> 01:51:30,531
support the enactment of the tree ordinance, right?

993
01:51:30,591 --> 01:51:42,943
There is some thought that it's going to take some staff time and it may, the money that comes in through the tree fund may help pay for the staff that are needed to protect the trees.

994
01:51:44,365 --> 01:51:49,651
They may pay for an arborist to make sure that only trees should be cut down that should be cut down in the future.

995
01:51:52,454 --> 01:52:03,145
But if everybody's comfortable with the language of purchasing and installing public trees throughout the city, we absolutely have line items for that and we need that very badly.

996
01:52:06,520 --> 01:52:17,507
I can see that as protecting the natural resources at this point, but I'm just not seeing how it would be incorporated into the site plan review, but maybe definitely the special permit.

997
01:52:18,647 --> 01:52:22,710
As a recommendation, I would like to know the temperature of the rest of the board.

998
01:52:32,119 --> 01:52:32,959
And this is Sally.

999
01:52:32,979 --> 01:52:45,083
Yeah, I agree with you, Jackie, that I don't see it as part of the site plan review at this stage, but part of the special permit at a later stage.

1000
01:52:52,324 --> 01:52:53,025
Thank you, Sally.

1001
01:52:53,285 --> 01:52:53,825
Anyone else?

1002
01:52:58,246 --> 01:52:58,446
Yes.

1003
01:53:02,247 --> 01:53:25,370
have a prep yeah sorry thank you madam chair um i have a preference for allowing the broader use over the very narrow use but i am open to the kind of logistics of that being done at another meeting if we do not feel that that's appropriate at this moment but figured it was worth saying that

1004
01:53:39,325 --> 01:53:42,415
And as far as the board approving this evening,

1005
01:53:44,142 --> 01:53:57,367
There's no pressure, because we have the purview to continue till a date certain if there's a lot of information here that you need to digest, especially with hearing new information that has not been shared with the entire PDS staff as of now.

1006
01:53:57,907 --> 01:54:09,771
But if we feel comfortable, which I can only speak for myself, feel comfortable with knowing that the proponent will work with the department heads and the city, and as long as the proponent is amenable

1007
01:54:11,057 --> 01:54:18,879
to these conditions, that these are not something that they're not amenable to, or what was going to cause an issue or something like that.

1008
01:54:18,939 --> 01:54:27,422
But as long as you're willing to work together going forward, I'm okay with the approvals tonight, but I don't know how the board is failing.

1009
01:54:34,429 --> 01:54:41,274
Madam Chair, can we note that the conditions have been reviewed by the proponent and the proponent has accepted the conditions.

1010
01:54:41,375 --> 01:54:45,198
So we would not like the board to think that we have any issues.

1011
01:54:45,578 --> 01:54:53,364
We've worked through them in the Medford and the consultant and the design team have been in consultation and we have settled on these conditions.

1012
01:54:57,007 --> 01:54:58,208
Thank you very much, Attorney Kilson.

1013
01:55:02,030 --> 01:55:03,251
This is Sally again.

1014
01:55:03,271 --> 01:55:07,254
I feel comfortable setting a motion to move forward.

1015
01:55:08,875 --> 01:55:17,142
The presentation basically covered all the aspects, if not most of the aspects that are usually concerning when doing a site plan review.

1016
01:55:18,003 --> 01:55:26,109
And the presentation was clear, answered concerns when it comes to the neighboring houses and the neighbors.

1017
01:55:26,249 --> 01:55:29,492
So I personally feel comfortable to move forward.

1018
01:55:36,638 --> 01:55:46,550
So Madam Chair, if I may, so there's two matters that you need to vote on tonight.

1019
01:55:46,750 --> 01:55:55,060
One is to make the findings that this meets the criteria for moving a site plan.

1020
01:55:57,011 --> 01:55:58,354
and adopting the conditions.

1021
01:55:58,775 --> 01:56:08,055
And then there's the matter of the plan development special permit, whether you want to recommend that city council approve it.

1022
01:56:11,542 --> 01:56:17,305
Yes, so at this point, what I'm looking for is a motion to approve with conditions as set forth.

1023
01:56:18,905 --> 01:56:27,530
Site plan review for one in three to 20 walk-in court from Merford Housing Authority, and that excludes miscellaneous conditions.

1024
01:56:28,210 --> 01:56:39,175
I'm not even sure if that's proper language, but approve with conditions minus the miscellaneous condition for site plan approval.

1025
01:56:41,530 --> 01:56:42,370
I second the motion.

1026
01:56:44,771 --> 01:56:45,332
I second.

1027
01:56:46,992 --> 01:56:53,335
And before we actually do the motion, does that even capture the approval properly?

1028
01:56:54,836 --> 01:57:03,679
You find that it meets the criteria outlined in the ordinance for approval of a site plan subject to the conditions.

1029
01:57:05,677 --> 01:57:22,306
Yes, and according to the zoning ordinance, the Community Development Board has approved, has found approval that is consistent with the performance standards as described in section 6.4 of section 11.7.10.

1030
01:57:24,567 --> 01:57:26,068
Does that need to be stated for the record?

1031
01:57:30,705 --> 01:57:35,226
It also meets the proposed development standards as listed in section 11.7.10.

1032
01:57:35,327 --> 01:57:44,590
You think that captures it?

1033
01:57:51,653 --> 01:58:04,837
State it out again, and we'll do it one more time, a motion to approve both conditions minus the miscellaneous condition as set forth for the site plan review for one and three to 20 Walkland Court for Meffitt House with Dawn.

1034
01:58:07,917 --> 01:58:08,938
Aye, Sally, motion.

1035
01:58:10,678 --> 01:58:11,078
I second.

1036
01:58:11,498 --> 01:58:12,059
I second.

1037
01:58:13,639 --> 01:58:17,020
Happy to give that to the person who said it simultaneously.

1038
01:58:17,040 --> 01:58:17,960
I think that was Pam.

1039
01:58:20,121 --> 01:58:20,781
Roll call.

1040
01:58:21,806 --> 01:58:22,467
Ari Fishman.

1041
01:58:24,508 --> 01:58:24,628
Aye.

1042
01:58:25,489 --> 01:58:26,249
Sally Akiki.

1043
01:58:27,210 --> 01:58:27,470
Yes.

1044
01:58:29,572 --> 01:58:30,572
Pam Mariabansky.

1045
01:58:31,153 --> 01:58:31,433
Yes.

1046
01:58:32,614 --> 01:58:34,095
And myself, Jackie McPherson.

1047
01:58:34,155 --> 01:58:34,615
I'm a yes.

1048
01:58:36,417 --> 01:58:50,747
And now I'm looking for a motion to recommend as a referral board to the city council for plan development district special permit, micro housing authorities one and three to 20 walk on court along with

1049
01:58:52,267 --> 01:58:59,772
the miscellaneous condition that the applicant shall contribute $50,000 to the city for the dedicated purpose of purchasing and installing public trees throughout the city.

1050
01:58:59,792 --> 01:59:04,216
All right, so any motion?

1051
01:59:04,236 --> 01:59:08,459
Second.

1052
01:59:08,479 --> 01:59:08,739
Second.

1053
01:59:11,961 --> 01:59:12,582
Ari Fishman?

1054
01:59:16,725 --> 01:59:16,845
Aye.

1055
01:59:18,286 --> 01:59:19,006
Sally Akiki?

1056
01:59:19,587 --> 01:59:19,847
Yes.

1057
01:59:21,528 --> 01:59:22,409
Pam Marionski?

1058
01:59:22,829 --> 01:59:23,210
Yes.

1059
01:59:24,190 --> 01:59:25,612
And myself, Jackie McPherson.

1060
01:59:25,892 --> 01:59:26,372
I'm a yes.

1061
01:59:27,994 --> 01:59:32,918
Thank you so much to Memphis Housing Authority, to Ms.

1062
01:59:32,958 --> 01:59:38,984
Kilson, Attorney Kilson, and to Mr. Morissette and to everyone else that has prepared and Mr. Driscoll.

1063
01:59:39,184 --> 01:59:46,570
There's so many of you, but thank you so much for all of your, your detailed information this evening and for such a great project.

1064
01:59:47,611 --> 01:59:47,992
Thank you.

1065
01:59:49,715 --> 02:00:00,899
very much for the, for the public this will be going to the special permit will be going to city council on Wednesday meeting date, February 24.

1066
02:00:04,040 --> 02:00:04,841
That sounds right.

1067
02:00:08,822 --> 02:00:09,703
For the hearing this.

1068
02:00:11,103 --> 02:00:12,264
I think their next meeting.

1069
02:00:12,344 --> 02:00:12,384
20th.

1070
02:00:12,424 --> 02:00:12,484
7pm.

1071
02:00:12,504 --> 02:00:13,144
Okay, thank you.

1072
02:00:28,598 --> 02:00:33,742
Okay, so for the board's order of business, the next is approval of minutes.

1073
02:00:51,476 --> 02:00:54,418
A motion to approve, let's see what the minutes are.

1074
02:00:55,259 --> 02:00:55,739
What date?

1075
02:00:56,416 --> 02:00:58,918
So there's December 6th and December 20th.

1076
02:01:00,539 --> 02:01:03,921
Can we do them collectively or do they have to be called out individually?

1077
02:01:07,283 --> 02:01:18,410
In case, you might want to do it separately in case there's anyone that wanted to recuse themselves, but you are just voting to accept them.

1078
02:01:19,311 --> 02:01:20,252
To follow, right?

1079
02:01:20,312 --> 02:01:20,532
Yeah.

1080
02:01:20,572 --> 02:01:20,732
Yeah.

1081
02:01:21,859 --> 02:01:25,100
a motion to accept the meeting minutes from 12, 2023.

1082
02:01:31,523 --> 02:01:36,065
I second.

1083
02:01:38,666 --> 02:01:40,807
We'll call Ari Fishman.

1084
02:01:41,947 --> 02:01:42,187
Yes.

1085
02:01:45,228 --> 02:01:46,069
Sally Akiki.

1086
02:01:46,469 --> 02:01:46,609
Yeah.

1087
02:01:47,632 --> 02:01:48,533
Pam Marianski?

1088
02:01:48,913 --> 02:01:49,193
Yes.

1089
02:01:50,014 --> 02:01:51,835
And myself, Jackie McPherson, yes.

1090
02:01:53,036 --> 02:01:58,921
And actually I went backwards and I apologize, but a motion to accept the meeting minutes from 12-6-23.

1091
02:01:59,061 --> 02:02:03,085
I motion, Sally.

1092
02:02:05,927 --> 02:02:06,307
Second.

1093
02:02:09,150 --> 02:02:10,631
Let's see, roll call.

1094
02:02:10,851 --> 02:02:11,472
Ari Fishman?

1095
02:02:12,593 --> 02:02:12,833
Yes.

1096
02:02:13,593 --> 02:02:14,334
Sally Kiki?

1097
02:02:14,814 --> 02:02:15,015
Yes.

1098
02:02:15,968 --> 02:02:16,809
Pam Marianski?

1099
02:02:17,230 --> 02:02:17,490
Yes.

1100
02:02:18,251 --> 02:02:20,474
And myself, Jackie McPherson, I'm a yes.

1101
02:02:23,377 --> 02:02:28,965
And the next item, miscellaneous or any other updates that the city may want to share with us?

1102
02:02:35,414 --> 02:02:37,716
I think that it would be appropriate to share.

1103
02:02:37,856 --> 02:02:43,700
So the city council and our office are jointly hiring a zoning consultant.

1104
02:02:44,080 --> 02:02:45,561
We've mentioned that before here.

1105
02:02:45,581 --> 02:02:52,246
So I'm gonna let you know that I am just reviewing and signing the contract on my end tonight.

1106
02:02:52,306 --> 02:02:54,868
It still has to be signed by other people, mayor, et cetera.

1107
02:02:55,648 --> 02:02:59,891
Um, but we're splitting the cost between our office and city council's budget.

1108
02:03:00,471 --> 02:03:05,915
Um, the consultant is Emily Ennis, who was the project manager on our comprehensive plan.

1109
02:03:06,395 --> 02:03:10,478
So we really appreciate that she already has all the background.

1110
02:03:10,558 --> 02:03:11,799
She's done all the reading.

1111
02:03:12,306 --> 02:03:15,288
She's familiar with all the public outreach that occurred.

1112
02:03:16,269 --> 02:03:25,456
And in fact, the recommendations on how we should move forward with changing zoning where she had written in our comprehensive plan, and we liked that.

1113
02:03:26,517 --> 02:03:31,521
She is also partnering with Jonathan Silverstein as a lawyer with

1114
02:03:33,022 --> 02:03:36,104
I cannot remember the full name of the firm off the top of my head.

1115
02:03:36,484 --> 02:03:45,508
He is a partner with Mark Bobrowski, one of the leading land use lawyers, who's actually the lawyer who did our recodification.

1116
02:03:46,029 --> 02:03:54,393
And so the ask is that Jonathan help with actual drafting of zoning language and making sure that the zoning language is all legal.

1117
02:03:55,704 --> 02:04:02,288
And Emily do help us, guide us through the changes, recommendations, et cetera.

1118
02:04:02,308 --> 02:04:07,791
I'm putting out to you all, to the public, to everybody, we will be doing a press release.

1119
02:04:08,151 --> 02:04:13,294
And in the press release, one of the things that we're planning to do is to ask two questions.

1120
02:04:13,894 --> 02:04:20,957
One is, if you're familiar with Medford zoning, is there something, one or more things that you would like to see changed?

1121
02:04:21,338 --> 02:04:22,258
Please share that with us.

1122
02:04:22,698 --> 02:04:27,000
If there's something that you'd like to see that say the same, please share that with us.

1123
02:04:27,561 --> 02:04:37,025
And I feel like that would help just flush out if there are things that we hadn't heard yet, we really have heard a lot from the public over the past few years with regards to our zoning.

1124
02:04:37,525 --> 02:04:40,547
And it's sort of like one more chance at that.

1125
02:04:41,636 --> 02:05:03,548
The city council has worked to put together a schedule of subcommittee and committee meetings, such that they would do over the course of a month, regularly scheduled meetings for a zoning and planning subcommittee, for example, an administration and finance committee, a governance committee.

1126
02:05:04,568 --> 02:05:14,771
And they actually worked with us to schedule the zoning and planning subcommittee to be Wednesday nights opposite the weeks of our CD board meetings.

1127
02:05:15,551 --> 02:05:29,495
So that it's a time that Danielle and I are already working to facilitate us being able to meet with them regularly at public meetings without us having to come in any extra time other than our already planned work hours.

1128
02:05:29,615 --> 02:05:31,696
So I will say we really appreciated that.

1129
02:05:32,472 --> 02:05:49,705
But their intention right now is to actually have that subcommittee meet twice a month so that we can bring things from the zoning consultant there so that there would be regular public meetings where people could talk about zoning issues, things that they want to see changed, etc.

1130
02:05:50,686 --> 02:05:52,247
So we wanted to let you guys know that.

1131
02:05:52,807 --> 02:05:56,250
Danielle and I have been working on a very long document

1132
02:05:57,097 --> 02:06:04,064
From everything from like little changes like looking at pronouns in the zoning.

1133
02:06:04,124 --> 02:06:13,232
I mean, it's not little, but it is, you know, just a formality as opposed to substantive changes and we've been working through that document.

1134
02:06:13,628 --> 02:06:16,290
If there are things you'd like us to be adding to that.

1135
02:06:16,450 --> 02:06:17,911
It's not really a public document.

1136
02:06:17,991 --> 02:06:19,372
It's like a working thing.

1137
02:06:19,432 --> 02:06:25,236
So we don't forget any any of the ideas that have come to us and that have been raised to us in the past.

1138
02:06:26,637 --> 02:06:32,180
And we'll be sharing that with Emily so that she's like here are the ideas, the things that we need to get going.

1139
02:06:32,841 --> 02:06:34,782
Emily's intention, our intention.

1140
02:06:35,473 --> 02:07:03,181
is to do this in a couple of phases, where the first phase is to do an additional round of what we call small changes, but just things where we change some language, we make changes that are not like completely rezoning the entire city, and that we make these smaller changes that might be impactful, but they've already been discussed, they've been hashed out, and they need to, they just need language changes to do those

1141
02:07:04,796 --> 02:07:15,182
soon over the next three to five, three to six months, and then do more impactful, bigger changes, things that might need some studies.

1142
02:07:16,342 --> 02:07:22,726
She's prepared to do massing studies for us to help understand some of the changes that we might wanna make.

1143
02:07:23,787 --> 02:07:32,572
And just so you all know, every single zoning change must come to this board for approval or for review and comment

1144
02:07:32,988 --> 02:07:35,030
before it goes to city council for voting.

1145
02:07:35,871 --> 02:07:49,803
So whether you are able to come to any of what I'm starting to think of as working sessions with the city councilors on their committee meeting nights or not, you will see every change will go through this board.

1146
02:07:51,164 --> 02:07:59,410
But if there's stuff you want to talk to us, if anybody wants to talk to me or Danielle individually about stuff, we're happy to set that up as well.

1147
02:08:00,051 --> 02:08:10,418
Sometimes it's easier to talk through ideas that are half-baked on a one-on-one basis before, you know, putting things forward in a public meeting.

1148
02:08:14,281 --> 02:08:14,761
Questions?

1149
02:08:15,422 --> 02:08:15,742
Thoughts?

1150
02:08:25,233 --> 02:08:27,054
All right, really, nothing?

1151
02:08:27,874 --> 02:08:28,855
I tried to be quiet long enough.

1152
02:08:31,096 --> 02:08:31,856
This is great.

1153
02:08:31,936 --> 02:08:32,776
Thank you, Alicia.

1154
02:08:32,796 --> 02:08:34,717
I'm excited to see how it works out.

1155
02:08:35,518 --> 02:08:35,778
Great.

1156
02:08:36,438 --> 02:08:46,722
And I just thought I would share, I sort of said this to some of the members before the meeting started, that in fact, we have several new staff have joined our office.

1157
02:08:47,903 --> 02:08:50,204
We have a new housing planner.

1158
02:08:51,177 --> 02:08:58,201
I think I should do this, I can name them all for you, but I'm always afraid of being like off the cuff and misspeaking.

1159
02:08:59,181 --> 02:09:14,569
Adithi Mugar, we have a new economic development planner, Jessica Martinez, and we have a new economic development director, Sal DiStefano.

1160
02:09:16,330 --> 02:09:20,372
So we're very excited to have all this new staff on board.

1161
02:09:22,925 --> 02:09:30,271
I wanted to put a shameless but very, very beneficial plug out for CPTC, the Citizens Planner Training Collaborative.

1162
02:09:30,291 --> 02:09:35,436
We're having our annual conference at the Holy Cross on Saturday, March 16th.

1163
02:09:35,476 --> 02:09:47,126
I say we because I'm a board member, and it's been a lifesaver for me, especially being a new board member previously and not working at the local, being a planner but not working directly in a local level and knowing how to,

1164
02:09:48,247 --> 02:09:52,851
handle municipal planning and land use and that's pretty much what it is.

1165
02:09:52,991 --> 02:10:09,307
It trains up planning boards and municipal planning staff on the use of land, on land use, like the newest trends and part of what the annual conference, what I like about the annual conference as opposed to like just the webinars or the on-demand training

1166
02:10:09,907 --> 02:10:13,769
Is that there's going to be everything there you mentioned emily and she's doing like a site plan review.

1167
02:10:13,789 --> 02:10:38,883
So again, this is a shameless plug for march 16th It's I think not only for your staff alicia, but for the so but not that you want to give up your saturday like I am um, but It's a wealth of information that um that people can really get into you who's going forward here on the board or In your planning career like if you are a plan I agree i've been i've attended those in the past and um

1168
02:10:40,445 --> 02:10:47,502
As a board member and as a city planner, and there's like a board track and there's the planner track.

1169
02:10:49,140 --> 02:10:51,681
they're really useful to feed you.

1170
02:10:52,281 --> 02:10:56,863
And we will, our office will pay the registration fees for you to go.

1171
02:10:57,063 --> 02:11:05,767
And another good thing, actually, if our board members, if a certain percentage of our board members attend these, we actually get bonus points on our grant applications.

1172
02:11:06,287 --> 02:11:11,809
It's actually a box to tick, like, do your city land use boards attend trainings?

1173
02:11:11,849 --> 02:11:14,330
Like, are they trained at all, basically?

1174
02:11:14,450 --> 02:11:16,771
Because there are municipalities where

1175
02:11:19,210 --> 02:11:20,432
people don't know what they're doing at all.

1176
02:11:20,452 --> 02:11:28,920
And we pride ourselves in having really great boards, educated boards that really contribute.

1177
02:11:29,460 --> 02:11:39,710
And anytime that you can get more knowledge and also get us those bonus points for grants is always fantastic.

1178
02:11:40,595 --> 02:11:52,842
Jackie, I googled it while you were talking, and I came to a page about the conference, and there's an email address, but there doesn't seem to be any link for registration.

1179
02:11:53,023 --> 02:11:55,864
Of course there's not, Alan.

1180
02:11:56,324 --> 02:11:59,146
Only because they were so, it's like, get the information.

1181
02:11:59,166 --> 02:11:59,727
Blame it, Alan.

1182
02:12:02,368 --> 02:12:05,431
And it's like you wanted everyone to save the date, but it's like you're going to have to save the date.

1183
02:12:05,451 --> 02:12:06,572
You got to build up this interest.

1184
02:12:06,592 --> 02:12:10,696
You got to go to the thing and we're still trying to figure out where to plug people in.

1185
02:12:10,736 --> 02:12:12,437
We're still trying to get keynote speakers.

1186
02:12:12,457 --> 02:12:14,379
Last year, we were able to get the lieutenant governor.

1187
02:12:14,399 --> 02:12:19,724
We jumped on her because, you know, she was coming into office and she's a planner, literally.

1188
02:12:20,344 --> 02:12:21,285
Well, she's a lawyer, but

1189
02:12:23,507 --> 02:12:46,334
she's she's a planner so and it's one of those things where she loved the opportunity so she came right into it being you know in her role but now we can't even get a keynote so we're trying to figure everything out this year and we said don't put anything on the on the website don't tell anyone about the registration and it looks like they did so i'm telling you word of mouth because i didn't think that there was anything on the website yet

1190
02:12:47,835 --> 02:12:50,599
But just more of a state of the date.

1191
02:12:50,819 --> 02:12:55,385
I mean, but Alicia, if you want, I can pretty much email you what's on there.

1192
02:12:55,405 --> 02:12:59,130
Like I know MBTA communities and 3A and stuff like that.

1193
02:12:59,150 --> 02:13:04,938
There's a lot of interest that planners have said over the course of these sessions.

1194
02:13:06,430 --> 02:13:13,714
And I pride myself in being a planner, and I have AICP, but at the same time, I lose my skills because I don't use it at the local level the way you guys do.

1195
02:13:13,794 --> 02:13:21,259
And being in this role right now, it's like I'm always, I feel so intimidated because I'm with these other chairs sitting around Massachusetts.

1196
02:13:21,279 --> 02:13:22,959
I'm like, oh, they're going to know so much more than me.

1197
02:13:22,999 --> 02:13:26,441
And I sat next to someone who was like, are you excited about 3A legislation?

1198
02:13:26,481 --> 02:13:27,142
He was like, what's that?

1199
02:13:27,622 --> 02:13:30,546
And I'm like, oh, so I do know more than you.

1200
02:13:30,646 --> 02:13:31,787
Wait, that's impossible.

1201
02:13:32,768 --> 02:13:34,611
So this is hugely needed.

1202
02:13:34,891 --> 02:13:37,514
I want to humble myself and say there's a lot of things I'm still learning, too.

1203
02:13:38,852 --> 02:13:42,015
Boys just need it, boys.

1204
02:13:42,055 --> 02:13:43,616
So again, if anyone's interested.

1205
02:13:44,137 --> 02:13:48,460
Right, if you want to send something around to the whole board, because we are missing several members today.

1206
02:13:48,480 --> 02:13:53,565
I'd like to invite all of our staff, any of them who want to attend.

1207
02:13:53,605 --> 02:13:57,888
I mean, there's no price there, but these are not expensive compared to some things.

1208
02:13:58,729 --> 02:13:59,510
No, so they're different.

1209
02:13:59,550 --> 02:14:00,811
This is going to break my bank.

1210
02:14:02,102 --> 02:14:03,423
This is different from the webinar.

1211
02:14:03,843 --> 02:14:12,568
In our conference now, not only is it in Worcester and Central Massachusetts, but you do get fed, like Daniel said, but it's an all-day event, 8 to 3.30.

1212
02:14:13,628 --> 02:14:17,811
But we've gone up to $100 for the registration now, just to let you know.

1213
02:14:19,652 --> 02:14:26,655
So when you said it's still pretty much affordable, but it's a little bit more than what people- You know, APA charges like $1,800 for registration.

1214
02:14:30,095 --> 02:14:38,144
And except for the core courses, like the comprehensive planning, zoning, and things like that, you get AICP credits, if you're AICP.

1215
02:14:38,465 --> 02:14:39,766
I mean, if anyone cares about that.

1216
02:14:39,786 --> 02:14:41,949
So I just wanted to let everyone know.

1217
02:14:41,969 --> 02:14:50,919
I don't want to drone on and on about that, but I did want to send that plug out, especially when Alicia mentioned Emily Ennis, because she is there, and some of the other

1218
02:14:51,786 --> 02:14:57,889
people that are hands-on with helping planners, like Julie Barrett, they'll be there.

1219
02:14:58,789 --> 02:14:59,790
My agency is there.

1220
02:15:00,150 --> 02:15:05,892
We can't get the secretary to do economic development plan, but we are going to do a one-stop session like we did last year.

1221
02:15:06,152 --> 02:15:07,313
That's AICP credit, too.

1222
02:15:09,137 --> 02:15:12,660
Yeah, we can pay for any of the board members who want to go.

1223
02:15:12,680 --> 02:15:15,243
And any of our staff who want to go.

1224
02:15:16,284 --> 02:15:19,286
Is it sounds like it might be appropriate for zoning board members.

1225
02:15:19,467 --> 02:15:23,550
And so we have definitely this is for all municipal zoning.

1226
02:15:24,131 --> 02:15:31,858
And I'm definitely definitely zoning board of appeals and, and planning board officials, pretty much.

1227
02:15:32,788 --> 02:15:44,135
Yeah, there's usually like a session like, like how to write a defensible decision, you know, just things like that are like super, super important for us.

1228
02:15:44,315 --> 02:15:44,435
Yeah.

1229
02:15:48,381 --> 02:15:50,623
Yeah, there's this real cool one this year.

1230
02:15:50,663 --> 02:15:53,446
They're doing a Laurel and Hardy go to planning school pretty much.

1231
02:15:53,466 --> 02:15:56,389
It's going to be a play on how you arrive at that decision.

1232
02:15:56,429 --> 02:15:57,210
So that's pretty cool.

1233
02:15:57,830 --> 02:16:04,397
So anyways, again, not to hold you up any longer, but I just wanted to throw that out there because I thought it was pretty awesome.

1234
02:16:06,099 --> 02:16:06,359
Great.

1235
02:16:08,961 --> 02:16:11,124
And I will say that if any of the board members

1236
02:16:11,903 --> 02:16:24,553
over the course, see other training that you feel is appropriate because of your membership here, you're always welcome to raise that to us to see if we have funding to pay for your registration and stuff.

1237
02:16:28,536 --> 02:16:33,260
Usually, we'll know about them and we'll share them out, but you're also welcome to bring them to our attention.

1238
02:16:36,863 --> 02:16:37,103
All right.

1239
02:16:38,418 --> 02:16:39,519
Thank you, Alicia.

1240
02:16:40,359 --> 02:16:45,123
Okay, so hearing no other updates, a motion to adjourn.

1241
02:16:51,447 --> 02:16:52,187
I so move.

1242
02:16:52,207 --> 02:16:52,868
Second.

1243
02:16:54,369 --> 02:16:56,330
If you don't want to go home, we'll hang out.

1244
02:16:58,432 --> 02:17:01,934
I second.

1245
02:17:01,954 --> 02:17:03,535
Did anyone second that?

1246
02:17:04,015 --> 02:17:04,456
Yeah.

1247
02:17:06,837 --> 02:17:07,598
So Ari Fishman?

1248
02:17:09,820 --> 02:17:10,061
Yep.

1249
02:17:11,263 --> 02:17:12,085
Polly Akiki.

1250
02:17:13,408 --> 02:17:13,709
Yeah.

1251
02:17:14,431 --> 02:17:15,312
Pam Mariansky.

1252
02:17:15,774 --> 02:17:16,094
Yes.

1253
02:17:16,896 --> 02:17:18,219
And myself, Jackie McPherson.

1254
02:17:18,339 --> 02:17:18,800
I'm a yes.

1255
02:17:19,201 --> 02:17:20,164
Good night, everyone.

1256
02:17:20,224 --> 02:17:20,725
Thank you.

1257
02:17:20,825 --> 02:17:22,970
Bye, everyone.
