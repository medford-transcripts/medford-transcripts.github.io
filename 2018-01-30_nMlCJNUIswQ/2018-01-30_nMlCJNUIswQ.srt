37
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:46,042

[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion by Councilor Dello Russo, seconded by Councilor Knight.

39
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:53,807
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

40
00:16:53,867 --> 00:16:54,947
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening, Chief.

41
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:05,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening, Mr. President, members of the council.

42
00:17:05,498 --> 00:17:06,499
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Leo Sacco.

43
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:11,004
[SPEAKER_04]: I live at 227 Elm Street in Medford and I'm chief of police.

44
00:17:11,504 --> 00:17:15,508
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a budget shortfall this year in our medical account.

45
00:17:16,489 --> 00:17:16,830
[SPEAKER_04]: We had

46
00:17:18,511 --> 00:17:25,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Requested $100,000 for that account that we received $60,000 We're pretty much through that $60,000.

47
00:17:26,275 --> 00:17:38,683
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had a year where we've had a number of injuries to offices many of those injuries resulting in surgery surgical procedures that we've received

48
00:17:40,674 --> 00:17:56,360
[SPEAKER_04]: quite large bills on, and we anticipate going forward that we have, at least at this time going forward, in about the next month to six weeks, about $30,000 more that we will incur.

49
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,621
[SPEAKER_04]: We anticipate these bills coming forward.

50
00:17:59,441 --> 00:18:09,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Our third party claims administrator is doing the best they can to knock some of the prices down, negotiating with doctors, hospitals, and other medical facilities.

51
00:18:10,345 --> 00:18:14,148
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the big ticket items is always the physical therapy after the surgery.

52
00:18:15,068 --> 00:18:18,831
[SPEAKER_04]: So we really do need that $60,000 infusion.

53
00:18:20,052 --> 00:18:24,235
[SPEAKER_04]: The other $60,000 infusion is into motor vehicle repairs.

54
00:18:25,816 --> 00:18:31,800
[SPEAKER_04]: As you know, we received new vehicles this year, but we still have a number of old vehicles that are in need of repair.

55
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,392
[SPEAKER_04]: constant repair, they're running 24-7.

56
00:18:36,452 --> 00:18:45,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the new vehicles, we had to pay some additional money outside of the free cash that we were allowed last year for some of the upfitting.

57
00:18:45,439 --> 00:18:51,703
[SPEAKER_04]: New radios were placed in the cruises, so just about everything that's in those new vehicles is brand new.

58
00:18:51,843 --> 00:18:56,547
[SPEAKER_04]: We weren't able to transfer much of the equipment from the older vehicles.

59
00:18:57,227 --> 00:19:02,391
[SPEAKER_04]: So there was a bit of a shortfall there, so we're requesting the $60,000 for that account as well.

60
00:19:06,528 --> 00:19:09,431
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Marks.

61
00:19:09,451 --> 00:19:13,154
[SPEAKER_07]: 60,000 requests for transfer for the medical.

62
00:19:13,895 --> 00:19:17,518
[SPEAKER_07]: Will that, do you anticipate that taking us to the end of the fiscal year?

63
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:24,884
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to say yes, but I have been wrong so many times before trying to guess on medicals.

64
00:19:25,004 --> 00:19:26,105
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hoping that it will.

65
00:19:26,245 --> 00:19:27,326
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't say that it will.

66
00:19:28,593 --> 00:19:33,375
[SPEAKER_07]: So we may be providing additional transfer towards the end of the year for that particular one.

67
00:19:33,395 --> 00:19:34,575
[SPEAKER_04]: We may be requesting that.

68
00:19:34,615 --> 00:19:40,258
[SPEAKER_04]: And I believe there will be some additional salary money to transfer in there because it's so late in the year.

69
00:19:40,318 --> 00:19:42,398
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't been able to hire the new offices.

70
00:19:43,059 --> 00:19:46,040
[SPEAKER_04]: We anticipate hiring a number of offices very soon.

71
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:53,662
[SPEAKER_04]: But the only available academy, the soonest we could get them into an academy is, I believe it's March 5th is the start date.

72
00:19:54,163 --> 00:19:58,524
[SPEAKER_04]: So the process was delayed because there were no academies available.

73
00:19:58,544 --> 00:20:01,145
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have money that's allocated for those salaries.

74
00:20:01,717 --> 00:20:12,681
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, and with the purchase of the new vehicles we received, do we anticipate a reduction in the vehicle maintenance account or?

75
00:20:12,941 --> 00:20:19,744
[SPEAKER_04]: If the winter is kind to us, I'm hoping that we can get through this winter without any other major repairs.

76
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:24,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Our wagon just had to have a new transmission, and that was about $3,000 before labor.

77
00:20:24,085 --> 00:20:24,185
[SPEAKER_04]: So,

78
00:20:29,465 --> 00:20:39,499
[SPEAKER_07]: Things do age they get used and they have to be replaced And if you could just explain briefly what makes up the hundred twenty thousand in these salaries account.

79
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:40,059
[SPEAKER_07]: Why do we have

80
00:20:41,269 --> 00:20:50,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the money that was budgeted for the additional offices, those five additional offices, I believe at budget time we anticipated retirements.

81
00:20:51,237 --> 00:21:04,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now we have a few more vacancies than we anticipated, but we weren't able to hire the people in a timely fashion because there were no academies available and we had to wait for the new list to come out of civil service.

82
00:21:04,628 --> 00:21:07,811
[SPEAKER_04]: We received that list in, I believe it was late November.

83
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:13,978
[SPEAKER_04]: We've completed the background checks, the medicals, the physicals, they've received conditional offers of employment.

84
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:18,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we're waiting for the March 5th academy start date.

85
00:21:19,843 --> 00:21:30,746
[SPEAKER_07]: So so chief, we had this discussion over the last several years, knowing that it takes many months for the academy to get an officer trained and finally on the street.

86
00:21:30,786 --> 00:21:35,967
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's increasingly difficult to get a seat in the academy in that.

87
00:21:36,448 --> 00:21:48,371
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought we were as a community going to start to at least have a recommended two or three seats per year that we can count on within an academy so we don't have to scramble trying to find one.

88
00:21:49,091 --> 00:21:56,577
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem with the academies is that the state requires, the Municipal Police Training Committee requires that we have a name to go for the seat.

89
00:21:57,017 --> 00:21:58,979
[SPEAKER_04]: They will not reserve seats without a name.

90
00:21:58,999 --> 00:22:03,442
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have to have a person already screened and ready to go before we can even request a seat.

91
00:22:04,283 --> 00:22:10,047
[SPEAKER_04]: By doing it that way, the door is almost closed on us because everyone else has been ahead of the curve.

92
00:22:10,067 --> 00:22:14,130
[SPEAKER_04]: They may have waited a year themselves to get that seat, to get that person in place.

93
00:22:15,151 --> 00:22:18,372
[SPEAKER_04]: The Transit Police Academy does not require that.

94
00:22:18,952 --> 00:22:23,533
[SPEAKER_04]: We are sending the first five to that academy March 5th.

95
00:22:23,573 --> 00:22:27,494
[SPEAKER_04]: There's another academy that's at Northern Essex Community College.

96
00:22:28,274 --> 00:22:32,955
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe that's a May date for that, and they don't require the name in advance.

97
00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:36,036
[SPEAKER_04]: The mayor has been kind enough to allow us.

98
00:22:37,036 --> 00:22:40,377
[SPEAKER_04]: We initially requested 10 officers for the reserve list.

99
00:22:41,397 --> 00:22:44,258
[SPEAKER_04]: She's allowed us to go to 13, because we found 13

100
00:22:45,459 --> 00:22:47,901
[SPEAKER_04]: great candidates on that list that we have.

101
00:22:48,662 --> 00:22:51,505
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll have a field of candidates to pick from.

102
00:22:51,525 --> 00:22:58,833
[SPEAKER_04]: By having that reserve list in place that this council passed a few years ago, that allows us to do exactly what you said.

103
00:22:58,853 --> 00:23:04,880
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a team that we can send to an academy when a seat is available and when we have a vacancy in the department.

104
00:23:05,734 --> 00:23:07,014
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is working.

105
00:23:07,074 --> 00:23:09,475
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just been slow getting this one off the ground.

106
00:23:09,895 --> 00:23:14,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, this new exam took place last March.

107
00:23:14,757 --> 00:23:17,938
[SPEAKER_04]: The marks came out probably September, October.

108
00:23:18,418 --> 00:23:20,198
[SPEAKER_04]: The list was certified in November.

109
00:23:20,818 --> 00:23:26,300
[SPEAKER_04]: We received it, and background checks were going on from that point forward.

110
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:32,362
[SPEAKER_04]: So we will have 13 people on a reserve list, five of which will be sent right off to an academy.

111
00:23:33,423 --> 00:23:44,156
[SPEAKER_07]: So, so the hope is that next year's fiscal budget, there'll be an additional appropriation for offices is that I'll be requesting more offices.

112
00:23:44,957 --> 00:23:46,900
[SPEAKER_04]: The last two years we've been budgeted for 107 total.

113
00:23:49,863 --> 00:23:58,475
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll obviously be requesting more, but if we can even stay at the 107, at least we'll be able to replace as we have retirements, and that was the goal.

114
00:23:58,515 --> 00:24:04,203
[SPEAKER_04]: We looked at our roster, and we know that by 2020, there'll be 20 retirements.

115
00:24:07,522 --> 00:24:10,865
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's not anticipating any of the others that may go sooner.

116
00:24:10,885 --> 00:24:19,851
[SPEAKER_04]: We just had two offices that I didn't count on retiring this year at July 1st when we started this new budget, but they were already retired.

117
00:24:20,752 --> 00:24:27,296
[SPEAKER_07]: And I also heard just through the grapevine there is a number more that will be retiring this year.

118
00:24:27,476 --> 00:24:28,077
[SPEAKER_04]: You probably heard that.

119
00:24:28,097 --> 00:24:28,817
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I'm saying.

120
00:24:28,877 --> 00:24:29,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Between now and 2020.

121
00:24:29,898 --> 00:24:30,699
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm talking within this year.

122
00:24:36,012 --> 00:24:38,833
[SPEAKER_07]: that I've heard numbers of six, seven retirements.

123
00:24:38,853 --> 00:24:39,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Could very well be.

124
00:24:40,173 --> 00:24:42,534
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I'm saying the 13 people on the reserve list.

125
00:24:43,195 --> 00:24:49,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Once we start chipping away, we'll request another list, put more people on that reserve list so we can pull up for an academy as soon as we can have an opening.

126
00:24:49,817 --> 00:24:51,477
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you, Chief.

127
00:24:51,497 --> 00:24:54,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Move for question.

128
00:24:54,919 --> 00:24:59,240

[SPEAKER_05]: Harold McGilvrey, 100 Main Street.

144
00:25:52,747 --> 00:25:56,310
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm here representing the Medford Police Patrolmen's Association.

145
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:57,771
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that I would talk after.

146
00:25:57,811 --> 00:25:59,212
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't know how this works, I'm sorry.

147
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:03,466
[SPEAKER_05]: I just appreciate the council's support.

148
00:26:03,486 --> 00:26:07,828
[SPEAKER_05]: The council has always been supportive of the Patrolmen's Union over the years.

149
00:26:07,868 --> 00:26:08,989
[SPEAKER_05]: We appreciate the support.

150
00:26:09,029 --> 00:26:12,150
[SPEAKER_05]: We appreciate Mayor Burke getting this done.

151
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:20,814
[SPEAKER_05]: We always say that a negotiated settlement is better than a settlement from an outside source, an arbitrated settlement.

152
00:26:21,494 --> 00:26:22,955
[SPEAKER_05]: And the mayor got involved.

153
00:26:24,046 --> 00:26:29,235
[SPEAKER_05]: just before Thanksgiving and things went really smoothly and we thank her for her efforts.

154
00:26:29,316 --> 00:26:36,789
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the third time we've been able to negotiate a settlement on our contract with Mayor Burke and thank you to Chief Sacco.

155
00:26:38,404 --> 00:26:46,526
[SPEAKER_05]: Chief, over the years, has been a better mediator than anybody the JLMC has ever sent out here to try to mediate these disputes.

156
00:26:48,567 --> 00:26:52,868
[SPEAKER_05]: He really does a good job when we hit that stalemate.

157
00:26:53,949 --> 00:27:04,912
[SPEAKER_05]: He just has a knack to be the go-between, and we've gotten a lot of things done over the years with that, through Chief Sacco's leadership, and we are gonna miss him.

158
00:27:06,531 --> 00:27:08,195
[SPEAKER_05]: towards the end of the year when he does retire.

159
00:27:08,235 --> 00:27:08,997
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you, Chief.

160
00:27:09,017 --> 00:27:10,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Chief.

161
00:27:11,282 --> 00:27:13,066
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank you for the third reading.

162
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:14,610

[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President, and welcome.

187
00:28:15,272 --> 00:28:19,574
[SPEAKER_03]: And as I go through these, the paperwork looks like everything's in order.

188
00:28:20,114 --> 00:28:23,055
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that the Board of Health had mentioned that there'd be a thorough cleaning.

189
00:28:23,416 --> 00:28:23,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

190
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:32,599
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the business itself isn't doing a major change, but the question is the time.

191
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:33,620
[SPEAKER_03]: We know about

192
00:28:34,765 --> 00:28:37,926
[SPEAKER_03]: your closings and everything's in order?

193
00:28:38,406 --> 00:29:02,050
[SPEAKER_01]: We plan to, basically, I spoke with Melanie with the Board of Health, and because it's our first business, she recommended that we stay closed once we receive the paperwork, the past the papers, so that way we can make those changes, make sure everything is clean, meets the standards and everything, and once we get the approval of everything's where it needs to be, then we would like to open up.

194
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:03,351
[SPEAKER_01]: And your business hours?

195
00:29:04,291 --> 00:29:09,474

00:29:23,422 --> 00:29:29,544
[SPEAKER_09]: I second the recommendation of the licensing check Jim and it's a family business The gentleman's worked in the family business.

203
00:29:29,584 --> 00:29:30,224
[SPEAKER_09]: That's my understanding.

204
00:29:30,244 --> 00:29:37,827
[SPEAKER_09]: He's taken over for debt So with that being said we all know roses right there right next to the old paint box It's a good establishment has been around a long time, and I wish him the best of luck.

205
00:29:37,887 --> 00:29:45,910
[SPEAKER_23]: I support this transfer wholeheartedly I think my question may have been answered president Caraviello, but the opening date is

206
00:29:46,610 --> 00:30:01,079
[SPEAKER_01]: It was supposed to be February 21st, but after seeing the condition and everything, we would like to fix the problems that are gonna help us proceed, rather than open up and then get shut down.

207
00:30:01,139 --> 00:30:07,423
[SPEAKER_01]: So we wanna make sure everything is fixed and where it needs to be, and then once we get the approval, we would like to open up.

[SPEAKER_06]: The motion by Councilor Scapelli, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

[SPEAKER_06]: Appreciate it.

223
00:30:41,268 --> 00:30:43,869
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion by Councilor Knight to be referred back to regular business.

224
00:30:44,489 --> 00:30:45,950
[SPEAKER_06]: Motions, orders, and resolutions.

225
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:50,191
[SPEAKER_06]: 18063, offered by Councilor Falco.

226
00:30:53,973 --> 00:30:58,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion by Councilor Knight to waive the reading and allow the sponsor to give us a synopsis.

227
00:30:59,054 --> 00:30:59,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Falco.

228
00:31:00,897 --> 00:31:02,158
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

229
00:31:02,198 --> 00:31:03,599
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

230
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:06,660
[SPEAKER_16]: I will actually read this so everybody can hear it.

231
00:31:06,721 --> 00:31:25,692
[SPEAKER_16]: Whereas the City of Bedford has long been a municipal leader in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in environmental stewardship, including creating the first municipal climate action plan, erecting the first municipal scale wind turbine in the state, installing solar panels in energy efficient LED lighting, among other initiatives.

232
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:43,706
[SPEAKER_16]: Whereas the city of Medford is blessed with nearly one-third open space with its 8.6 square miles, including the Mystic Lakes, Mystic River, and Wrights Pond, which provide valuable habitat for wildlife and recreational opportunities for residents.

233
00:31:44,327 --> 00:31:55,957
[SPEAKER_16]: Whereas millions of non-biodegradable plastic bags are used in Medford each year, creating litter, polluting our streets, parks, and waterways, harming wildlife, and potentially causing harm to human infants.

234
00:31:56,637 --> 00:32:08,900
[SPEAKER_16]: Whereas plastic bags are difficult to recycle and frequently contaminate material and damage equipment used to process items collected through the city's single stream curbside recycling program.

235
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:15,122
[SPEAKER_16]: Whereas reusable bags are considered to be the best option to reduce waste

236
00:32:15,602 --> 00:32:35,428
[SPEAKER_16]: and litter, protect wildlife and conserve resources, and that many inexpensive and convenient varieties are increasingly available and used by Medford residents and visitors, whereas a number of businesses in the city have already taken affirmative steps to encourage the use of reusable bags by their patrons.

237
00:32:36,048 --> 00:32:48,114
[SPEAKER_16]: Whereas 61 cities and towns in the Commonwealth, including neighboring Somerville and Arlington, and nearby Cambridge, Boston, and Melrose have enacted ordinances governing the use of plastic bags in their communities.

238
00:32:48,134 --> 00:33:01,580
[SPEAKER_16]: Be it resolved that the City of Medford, working with the Medford City Council, the Energy and Environment Health and Law Departments, the Energy and Environment Committee, SEEM, Student Environmental Advocates of Medford,

239
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:28,488
[SPEAKER_16]: the Medford Chamber of Commerce and city merchants and its citizenry create an ordinance that will govern and ultimately phase out the use of plastic bags at all points of sale in the city to decrease damage to our environment, reduce litter and waste removal costs, and improve public health without being detrimental to conducting business in our city.

240
00:33:29,515 --> 00:33:31,397
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, if I may.

241
00:33:32,037 --> 00:33:32,498
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

242
00:33:32,678 --> 00:33:41,826
[SPEAKER_16]: Tonight I offer this resolution because I believe it is an important issue that has a deep and lasting negative impact on our city, its residents, and our environment.

243
00:33:42,367 --> 00:33:45,209
[SPEAKER_16]: There are many reasons why we should ban plastic bags.

244
00:33:45,529 --> 00:33:47,992
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll name a few but there are plenty.

245
00:33:48,772 --> 00:33:50,794
[SPEAKER_16]: Plastic bags create a major litter problem.

246
00:33:50,974 --> 00:33:52,655
[SPEAKER_16]: Visual blight when they blow into trees.

247
00:33:53,095 --> 00:33:56,957
[SPEAKER_16]: They're the third largest type of litter from land-based sources found on U.S.

248
00:33:57,017 --> 00:33:57,318
[SPEAKER_16]: coasts.

249
00:33:57,878 --> 00:34:00,520
[SPEAKER_16]: They pollute our oceans, rivers, and landscapes.

250
00:34:02,061 --> 00:34:05,723
[SPEAKER_16]: Plastic bags are a hazard to marine life, seabirds, animals.

251
00:34:06,952 --> 00:34:19,757
[SPEAKER_16]: Plastic bags do not biodegrade, and although they do fragment through mechanical action and photodegradation in the presence of light, these processes are slow, taking an estimated 200 plus years to complete.

252
00:34:21,037 --> 00:34:24,658
[SPEAKER_16]: Polyethylene bags are made from non-renewable fossil fuels.

253
00:34:25,218 --> 00:34:32,121
[SPEAKER_16]: The over 100 billion plastic shopping bags used each year in the United States are made up of the estimated equivalent of 439 million gallons of oil.

254
00:34:35,338 --> 00:34:38,042
[SPEAKER_16]: Plastic bags clog storm water drains.

255
00:34:39,123 --> 00:34:41,326
[SPEAKER_16]: They're consumed in extremely high volumes.

256
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:45,551
[SPEAKER_16]: Consumers, more often than not, do not recycle plastic bags.

257
00:34:46,453 --> 00:34:50,017
[SPEAKER_16]: Plastic bags contribute to overburdened landfills.

258
00:34:50,778 --> 00:34:57,640
[SPEAKER_16]: While researching this issue, and I mentioned this earlier, plastic bags are banned in over 60 plus cities and towns in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

259
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,800
[SPEAKER_16]: Plastic bags are banned in over 40 countries.

260
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:08,362
[SPEAKER_16]: It is time that we add our city to the list of the 60 plus cities and towns that have ordinances that ban plastic bags.

261
00:35:09,742 --> 00:35:13,183
[SPEAKER_16]: Recently, I was approached by individual residents, organizations, and students

262
00:35:14,185 --> 00:35:17,646
[SPEAKER_16]: with regard to offering a resolution to banning plastic bags in our community.

263
00:35:18,447 --> 00:35:23,729
[SPEAKER_16]: At Medford High School, we have a great program called the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility.

264
00:35:24,649 --> 00:35:32,892
[SPEAKER_16]: Within the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility, we have seen student environmental advocates of Medford.

265
00:35:33,012 --> 00:35:40,015
[SPEAKER_16]: This group has been working hard on this issue and other environmental issues along with the Energy and Environment Committee as well.

266
00:35:41,478 --> 00:35:48,382
[SPEAKER_16]: Surveys have shown that plastic carryout bags are used for approximately 12 minutes and then discarded.

267
00:35:49,223 --> 00:36:05,133
[SPEAKER_16]: With that being said, we need to evaluate if we as a community value the use of a plastic bag often used for a few minutes more than protecting our environment from the devastating long-lasting effects of plastic bags.

268
00:36:06,338 --> 00:36:12,164
[SPEAKER_16]: As a father of three children, it is my hope to leave this community a better place for our children and our grandchildren.

269
00:36:12,844 --> 00:36:13,625
[SPEAKER_16]: This is a start.

270
00:36:14,526 --> 00:36:21,373
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's use this resolution tonight as a launching pad to develop a city ordinance to ban plastic bags in the City of Medford.

271
00:36:21,393 --> 00:36:26,238
[SPEAKER_16]: I thank you for your time and I respectfully ask my colleagues for the consideration

272
00:36:27,992 --> 00:36:35,454
[SPEAKER_16]: And I believe that we should move this to the subcommittee on ordinances, where we can have an ordinance developed and designed.

273
00:36:35,574 --> 00:36:39,896
[SPEAKER_16]: And if I may, Mr. President, I'd like to amend this resolution.

274
00:36:40,616 --> 00:36:44,537
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'd like to amend it until we actually get an ordinance in place.

275
00:36:45,097 --> 00:36:50,919
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd like to see the city set up plastic bag recycling stations in each of our public buildings, City Hall.

276
00:36:51,399 --> 00:36:53,541
[SPEAKER_16]: the library, we can come up with a list.

277
00:36:53,641 --> 00:37:00,886
[SPEAKER_16]: But I think that we should do that to actually at least get the ball rolling until we actually have a formal ordinance in place.

278
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:05,789
[SPEAKER_16]: At this point in time, I know there are a number of people that would like to speak on this issue.

279
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:10,513
[SPEAKER_16]: If I could bring up Rubia, who is from the library.

280
00:37:12,434 --> 00:37:17,276
[SPEAKER_16]: for Medford High School, and she has a number of packets that she'd like to give out as well.

281
00:37:17,316 --> 00:37:20,737
[SPEAKER_16]: She's from the Student Environmental Advocates of Medford.

282
00:37:21,497 --> 00:37:21,918
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening.

283
00:37:21,938 --> 00:37:23,058
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address of the record, please.

284
00:37:23,178 --> 00:37:24,159
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry?

285
00:37:24,179 --> 00:37:26,579
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address of the record, please.

286
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:28,380
[SPEAKER_00]: 24 Wright Avenue, Medford, Massachusetts.

287
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,821
[SPEAKER_06]: Speak up so we can hear you.

288
00:37:30,841 --> 00:37:32,502
[SPEAKER_00]: 24 Wright Avenue, Medford, Massachusetts.

289
00:37:32,522 --> 00:37:32,762
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

290
00:37:34,033 --> 00:37:35,394
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening City Council Members.

291
00:37:35,414 --> 00:37:38,917
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Ruby Fernandez and I am a junior at Medford High School.

292
00:37:39,317 --> 00:37:48,465
[SPEAKER_00]: There I am a member of the Turtles and Salamanders Club, the Students Environmental Advocates of Medford, and the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility.

293
00:37:49,125 --> 00:38:03,808
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally care about the environment a lot and have taken notice of the actions that other communities took to reduce the amount of waste that they emit into the environment, which is why I chose to begin the petition that I present to you now, showing the major support that there is behind this issue.

294
00:38:04,569 --> 00:38:09,850
[SPEAKER_00]: Plastic in general has only been around for about a century, but it has already affected our environment greatly.

295
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:18,792
[SPEAKER_00]: With 300 million tons of plastics produced globally each year, only 10% of that is recycled, and an estimated 7 million tons end up in our oceans.

296
00:38:19,692 --> 00:38:28,416
[SPEAKER_00]: The average decomposition rate of the toxic material is 450 years, but some specific kinds can take up to 1,000 years to biodegrade.

297
00:38:28,856 --> 00:38:41,962
[SPEAKER_00]: The material can often be confused as food by marine life, and as it breaks down into smaller fragments, it's ingested by more organisms, thus moving up the food chain and eventually reaching our own food supply.

298
00:38:42,462 --> 00:38:47,905
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many ways that we can minimize the emittance of this toxic material into our environment.

299
00:38:48,705 --> 00:38:59,152
[SPEAKER_00]: In Medford were to have their own plastic bag ordinance, we would join the other communities who have made similar efforts, including, but not limited to, Boston, Somerville, Cambridge, and Wakefield.

300
00:38:59,793 --> 00:39:10,841
[SPEAKER_00]: By having retail stores that currently give out a checkout bag for a customer's purchase, requiring them to charge a minimum for each provided bag, these charged bags would also have to be

301
00:39:11,601 --> 00:39:19,387
[SPEAKER_00]: of reusable, recyclable, or compostable material that can be 100% recycled and were already manufactured with at least some recycled material.

302
00:39:20,207 --> 00:39:27,092
[SPEAKER_00]: The petition that is in front of you now gained 500 supporters in only under a month and continues to grow to over 600 supporters.

303
00:39:27,632 --> 00:39:37,539
[SPEAKER_00]: As of right now, there are a number of people throughout the community that are in support of this petition and this ordinance coming into place in Medford.

304
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:38,740
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

305
00:39:48,595 --> 00:39:50,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening, name and address of the record, please.

306
00:39:50,316 --> 00:39:57,157
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening, Alicia Hunt, I'm the Director of Energy and Environment for the City of Medford, and my address is 41 Wasson Street in Medford.

307
00:39:57,737 --> 00:40:17,262
[SPEAKER_12]: And the mayor asked me to come this evening and just express her pleasure that the students and the residents of Medford have shown such strong support for this environmental measure, and to let you know that she is very much in support of this, and the administration would be happy to work with people on crafting an appropriate ordinance for the City of Medford.

308
00:40:18,323 --> 00:40:20,564
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

309
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:21,245
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

310
00:40:23,407 --> 00:40:26,049
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, thank you.

311
00:40:26,209 --> 00:40:35,216
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm grateful to Councilor Falco for his leadership in this matter and the enthusiasm shown from so many of our citizens.

312
00:40:35,296 --> 00:40:42,141
[SPEAKER_14]: I've received a number of communications over the past week showing that there are many people in favor.

313
00:40:42,221 --> 00:40:46,605
[SPEAKER_14]: I have also shown some that are not so enthusiastic about this.

314
00:40:47,065 --> 00:41:03,033
[SPEAKER_14]: But I look forward to examining this measure in detail in committee and hearing the input of so many leaders from the various organizations and departments that have been outlined in this finally written resolution.

315
00:41:03,053 --> 00:41:03,714
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

316
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:05,960
[SPEAKER_17]: Name and address of the record, please.

317
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:06,681
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

318
00:41:06,761 --> 00:41:07,721
[SPEAKER_17]: My name is Curtis Tooden.

319
00:41:07,821 --> 00:41:09,341
[SPEAKER_17]: I live at 72 Bonner Ave.

320
00:41:09,761 --> 00:41:13,683
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm here representing the Medford Energy and Environment Committee.

321
00:41:14,043 --> 00:41:17,324
[SPEAKER_17]: I also advise the student environmental club at Medford High School.

322
00:41:17,784 --> 00:41:26,906
[SPEAKER_17]: And I want to thank the Councilors for taking up this issue and for the students taking on this leadership role and helping bring about an issue that would make a real difference for our environment.

323
00:41:27,907 --> 00:41:31,528
[SPEAKER_17]: A lot of great points have already been made, so I'll just clarify what's in the packet for everybody.

324
00:41:32,868 --> 00:41:40,335
[SPEAKER_17]: The first is a cover sheet that shows all of the Massachusetts cities and towns that have currently passed a plastic bag ordinance into law.

325
00:41:40,775 --> 00:41:46,980
[SPEAKER_17]: So you'll notice some towns like Boston and Arlington aren't listed, and that's because they recently passed their ordinances.

326
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:48,802
[SPEAKER_17]: So a point of clarification there.

327
00:41:48,842 --> 00:42:00,292
[SPEAKER_17]: On the back are three sample ordinances, and those are taken from a list of, it's really a spreadsheet of 60 municipalities in Medford with their ordinance, how the ordinance is enforced,

328
00:42:00,812 --> 00:42:02,753
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's all just for your consideration.

329
00:42:02,813 --> 00:42:12,076
[SPEAKER_17]: It's followed up with a frequently asked questions sheet that explains everything you need to know about plastic bags and why we should have an ordinance in Medford.

330
00:42:12,776 --> 00:42:16,077
[SPEAKER_17]: And like I said, thank you for taking this under consideration.

331
00:42:16,117 --> 00:42:25,080
[SPEAKER_17]: I can answer any questions that you have right now or we can open it up to other residents in the community who are representing other environmental organizations and just other concerned citizens.

332
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:26,060
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

333
00:42:30,606 --> 00:42:30,986
[SPEAKER_21]: Good evening.

334
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:32,027
[SPEAKER_21]: Name and address of the record, please.

335
00:42:32,267 --> 00:42:32,607
[SPEAKER_21]: Hello.

336
00:42:32,767 --> 00:42:35,508
[SPEAKER_21]: Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave., Medford, Mass.

337
00:42:35,908 --> 00:42:43,772
[SPEAKER_21]: When you go shopping, what I find very distressful, especially as someone who likes to recycle, they force these bags on you.

338
00:42:43,812 --> 00:42:50,555
[SPEAKER_21]: So if you're buying a bottle of orange juice and groceries, they take one bottle of orange juice, throw it in a plastic bag, and then

339
00:42:51,786 --> 00:42:52,266
[SPEAKER_21]: It's crazy.

340
00:42:52,306 --> 00:42:54,687
[SPEAKER_21]: So you walk up with like six bags that you really don't need.

341
00:42:54,747 --> 00:42:55,627
[SPEAKER_21]: You can consolidate.

342
00:42:55,667 --> 00:43:03,450
[SPEAKER_21]: But before you even get a chance to say anything, I don't understand being business people, why they want to buy a product and then just get rid of it so quickly.

343
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:04,230
[SPEAKER_21]: It makes no sense.

344
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:08,872
[SPEAKER_21]: So they don't train the people in the grocery store to conserve the bags.

345
00:43:09,832 --> 00:43:10,752
[SPEAKER_21]: They're all over the place.

346
00:43:10,852 --> 00:43:11,713
[SPEAKER_21]: I try my best.

347
00:43:11,733 --> 00:43:19,195
[SPEAKER_21]: And you know that waste management doesn't want us recycling them, but you can take an old plastic, uh, orange juice, uh,

348
00:43:20,992 --> 00:43:29,955
[SPEAKER_21]: the bottle, and you can put the plastic bags in there, and then you can put the cap back on it, and waste management can't complain because it's not gonna get into their machinery, and that is their problem.

349
00:43:30,035 --> 00:43:31,676
[SPEAKER_21]: It's the machinery with the waste management.

350
00:43:31,716 --> 00:43:34,837
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm all for this, Councilor Falco, good work.

351
00:43:36,318 --> 00:43:36,598
[SPEAKER_21]: Onward.

352
00:43:37,058 --> 00:43:37,358
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

353
00:43:43,821 --> 00:43:45,381
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening, name and address of the record, please.

354
00:43:45,842 --> 00:43:49,283
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi, my name is Randy Rogin, 63 Lincoln Road, Medford.

355
00:43:50,833 --> 00:43:57,275
[SPEAKER_19]: I've lived here for 15 years, which I think probably still makes me a newcomer, but I just want to share a little bit about why I'm here.

356
00:43:57,295 --> 00:43:58,455
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm the mother of two children.

357
00:43:58,895 --> 00:44:00,716
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm a board member of the Friends for the Fells.

358
00:44:01,676 --> 00:44:07,037
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm a member of Women Working for Oceans, W2O, and I have a PhD in biology.

359
00:44:07,077 --> 00:44:13,679
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm currently a professor at Boston University, and I've been here forever because I did my graduate work at Tufts, stayed at Harvard, and now I'm at BU.

360
00:44:14,984 --> 00:44:16,524
[SPEAKER_19]: Most importantly, I'm an ocean scientist.

361
00:44:17,405 --> 00:44:19,885
[SPEAKER_19]: I study temperate, tropical, and deep-sea corals.

362
00:44:21,186 --> 00:44:25,767
[SPEAKER_19]: I examine coral reef resilience to a number of stressors, mostly climate change, but also local pollution.

363
00:44:26,987 --> 00:44:36,070
[SPEAKER_19]: Recently, I was awarded a grant entitled, Hidden Problems in Secret Corals, Exploring the Microplastic Abundance in Local Temperate Corals Along Our Coastlines.

364
00:44:37,357 --> 00:44:39,038
[SPEAKER_19]: I was looking for microplastic fibers.

365
00:44:39,058 --> 00:44:42,960
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't even know if you know that we have corals here in Massachusetts, but we do.

366
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:49,523
[SPEAKER_19]: And what we found is that each coral, on average, can actually contain over 100 microplastic fibers.

367
00:44:49,883 --> 00:44:52,365
[SPEAKER_19]: For a coral this big, each one has over 100.

368
00:44:55,461 --> 00:45:03,513
[SPEAKER_19]: They are eating plankton and plastic particles just like oysters, mussels, everything else that filters our seas and helps to clean them.

369
00:45:03,733 --> 00:45:07,699
[SPEAKER_19]: But while they're eating plastics and then we eat them, we are also eating plastics.

370
00:45:09,493 --> 00:45:14,277
[SPEAKER_19]: It wasn't really until I started working on this issue in my own laboratory that I saw the inescapability of this issue.

371
00:45:14,777 --> 00:45:20,202
[SPEAKER_19]: Plastics are everywhere and in the most remote parts of our planet, in our deepest oceans, in the atmosphere, and in the soil.

372
00:45:20,963 --> 00:45:27,808
[SPEAKER_19]: Enacting a plastic bag ordinance is a really important first step, but I think it's important to also mention to this body that it won't fully solve the problem.

373
00:45:28,349 --> 00:45:32,932
[SPEAKER_19]: But in my professional view, here are the four or five things that I think it will do most urgently.

374
00:45:34,094 --> 00:45:42,340
[SPEAKER_19]: First, it will put the plastic issue front and center in the public eye, which will help to foster the necessary awakening that must happen to secure the health of our planet and ourselves.

375
00:45:43,401 --> 00:45:50,387
[SPEAKER_19]: It'll help to curtail one of the most obnoxious plastics in our society, bags that are used for mere minutes.

376
00:45:51,337 --> 00:45:55,380
[SPEAKER_19]: but that can actually last for centuries, and that are made from materials that took millennia to form.

377
00:45:55,941 --> 00:45:57,082
[SPEAKER_19]: It makes absolutely no sense.

378
00:45:57,762 --> 00:46:10,292
[SPEAKER_19]: And the studies that show, there are lots of studies that have shown so far that from the ordinances that already exist, for example, in California that have been enacted for a few years, that these are successful, both in changing corporate and consumer behavior.

379
00:46:10,432 --> 00:46:15,416
[SPEAKER_19]: And I've given you a handout that shows on the backside a few tables from those studies.

380
00:46:17,527 --> 00:46:20,469
[SPEAKER_19]: The benefits to marine, aquatic, and terrestrial life are immediate.

381
00:46:20,830 --> 00:46:28,236
[SPEAKER_19]: Currently, my bedroom window faces out over a beautiful maple tree that belongs to my neighbor that has had the same plastic bag stuck in it for over four years.

382
00:46:28,936 --> 00:46:35,702
[SPEAKER_19]: The leaves on that part of the branch don't grow, it's ugly, and it's a constant reminder of the longevity of each and every bag.

383
00:46:36,852 --> 00:46:40,379
[SPEAKER_19]: As a board member for the Friends of the Fells, I can tell you that we have our plates full.

384
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:45,890
[SPEAKER_19]: Even with our wonderful trail adopters program, we can't possibly remove every plastic bag from the forest.

385
00:46:46,190 --> 00:46:48,014
[SPEAKER_19]: An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.

386
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:51,528
[SPEAKER_19]: And as an ocean scientist, the data are unignorable.

387
00:46:52,128 --> 00:46:59,612
[SPEAKER_19]: I've seen with my own eyes and picked up with my own hands plastic debris from every single tropical ocean on this planet, and more locally here in Boston Harbor.

388
00:46:59,992 --> 00:47:04,614
[SPEAKER_19]: I've seen bags floating side by side with jellies, and I've shown you a picture of what that looks like on your handout.

389
00:47:05,394 --> 00:47:07,075
[SPEAKER_19]: And I can tell you that even I've been fooled.

390
00:47:07,195 --> 00:47:12,277
[SPEAKER_19]: When the bags have been floating for a while and they start to rip, you can't tell.

391
00:47:12,297 --> 00:47:12,998
[SPEAKER_19]: I can't tell.

392
00:47:14,458 --> 00:47:17,159
[SPEAKER_19]: whether what's jelly and what's a plastic bag and tell them right on top of it.

393
00:47:17,499 --> 00:47:19,520
[SPEAKER_19]: Sea turtles, sea birds, they're also fools.

394
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:26,543
[SPEAKER_19]: A paper was just published this week in the journal Science by my peers and former mentor, linking plastic waste with coral disease.

395
00:47:27,003 --> 00:47:36,526
[SPEAKER_19]: There are currently between 6,000 and 245 million metric tons of plastic in the oceans right now, with five to 12 million metric tons of new plastic entering the ocean annually.

396
00:47:37,206 --> 00:47:39,647
[SPEAKER_19]: The North Pacific garbage patch is no longer unique.

397
00:47:40,047 --> 00:47:41,368
[SPEAKER_19]: Now there are garbage patches everywhere.

398
00:47:42,327 --> 00:47:48,072
[SPEAKER_19]: So back to the big issue, recycling plastic bags is a really good idea, but the studies are showing that it hasn't worked.

399
00:47:48,232 --> 00:47:56,438
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it's a good short-term measure, but I want to just mention that only 3 to 10% of plastic bags out there are actually recycled worldwide.

400
00:47:57,039 --> 00:48:00,761
[SPEAKER_19]: Most are discarded, and 90% of them are discarded after only a single use.

401
00:48:01,742 --> 00:48:05,023
[SPEAKER_19]: And Americans use roughly 300 plastic bags per person per year.

402
00:48:05,503 --> 00:48:07,584
[SPEAKER_19]: And if that number seems high, think of it this way.

403
00:48:08,064 --> 00:48:11,326
[SPEAKER_19]: The average family goes through 15 bags per trip to the grocery store.

404
00:48:11,346 --> 00:48:20,049
[SPEAKER_19]: And it costs us money to make them, to recycle them, and a huge amount of labor to hand-remove them from recycling sorters where they gum up the works of standard stream recycling.

405
00:48:20,089 --> 00:48:21,329
[SPEAKER_19]: They have to be recycled separately.

406
00:48:21,409 --> 00:48:28,452
[SPEAKER_19]: So I've actually also shown you a picture of that in your handout about how they have to be hand-removed from sorters after just an eight-hour shift.

407
00:48:29,252 --> 00:48:32,015
[SPEAKER_19]: All of this for bags that we use once for 10 to 12 minutes.

408
00:48:32,856 --> 00:48:33,576
[SPEAKER_19]: I think we can do better.

409
00:48:34,177 --> 00:48:36,939
[SPEAKER_19]: As a mother, I don't want my children to live in a world wrapped in plastic.

410
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:41,143
[SPEAKER_19]: Joni Mitchell said it right when she said, you know, we paved paradise, put up a parking lot.

411
00:48:41,664 --> 00:48:45,628
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't actually have a catchy lyric for you, but we're double bagging the world, and I think it's time to stop.

412
00:48:46,188 --> 00:48:47,149
[SPEAKER_19]: So thank you for listening.

413
00:48:53,851 --> 00:48:55,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening, name and address of the record, please.

414
00:48:55,832 --> 00:48:56,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, sir.

415
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:58,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Matt Palumbo, 180 Harbor Street, Medford.

416
00:48:58,434 --> 00:48:59,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening, Mr. President.

417
00:48:59,595 --> 00:49:00,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening, council members.

418
00:49:00,496 --> 00:49:01,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for having me here.

419
00:49:02,117 --> 00:49:15,047
[SPEAKER_02]: As a Medford resident, as a Marine Corps veteran, as a graduate student at the Fletcher School, and as a volunteer with the Surfrider Foundation, I wanted to come here tonight and express my support for the high school students and the wonderful job they did.

420
00:49:15,407 --> 00:49:20,431
[SPEAKER_02]: As someone who takes public service seriously, I know what that looks like, and that's what it looks like.

421
00:49:20,491 --> 00:49:22,873
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's incredible, I've never actually

422
00:49:23,493 --> 00:49:24,915
[SPEAKER_02]: seen anything like that before.

423
00:49:25,355 --> 00:49:34,545
[SPEAKER_02]: I volunteered for a while when I used to live in California and I just want to put my support behind their efforts and I also want to put Surfrider's support behind their efforts at all.

424
00:49:34,565 --> 00:49:38,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Surfrider, if you're not familiar, is a non-profit environmental organization.

425
00:49:38,570 --> 00:49:41,713
[SPEAKER_02]: We advocate for causes just like this.

426
00:49:42,594 --> 00:49:50,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Something that hasn't been touched on tonight are the economic impacts, the economic arguments that people make against these type of ordinances.

427
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:54,804
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like that's really important to bring up, and so that's where I want to lend my support.

428
00:49:54,924 --> 00:50:05,792
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have it printed out, but there's a report called the Equinox Report by the Equinox Center, and in 2013, they published this report to answer some of your more common questions about the economic impacts of these bag bans.

429
00:50:06,573 --> 00:50:11,436
[SPEAKER_02]: I can certainly forward that to you, and I would like to send that electronically to Councilman Falco if I may.

430
00:50:13,999 --> 00:50:18,885
[SPEAKER_02]: So the idea is to possibly prevent some of the pain that goes with going down this path.

431
00:50:19,185 --> 00:50:23,890
[SPEAKER_02]: As other people have said, we're the 61st and 62nd town in Massachusetts to go down this route.

432
00:50:24,251 --> 00:50:27,715
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I can alleviate some of the issues, I'd certainly like to do that with some of this information.

433
00:50:28,570 --> 00:50:35,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Furthermore, I think something that often gets downplayed is the support and the different aspects of the ordinance.

434
00:50:35,533 --> 00:50:44,557
[SPEAKER_02]: So as a surfrider and personally, I support an ordinance that does not differentiate between suppliers of these bags, regardless of their type or their size.

435
00:50:45,597 --> 00:50:47,918
[SPEAKER_02]: People counter that and they say, well, this hurts small businesses.

436
00:50:48,439 --> 00:50:51,320
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd like to read an excerpt from a small business in Somerville.

437
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:54,281
[SPEAKER_02]: As you all know, Somerville just passed their ban about a year ago.

438
00:50:54,321 --> 00:50:57,943
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is from a gentleman in Somerville, Porter Square.

439
00:50:59,323 --> 00:51:02,485
[SPEAKER_02]: My business has not been adversely affected by the bag ban over the past year.

440
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:08,969
[SPEAKER_02]: It has not been an additional burden for my business or clients and has not represented an undue hardship on our bottom line.

441
00:51:09,389 --> 00:51:12,932
[SPEAKER_02]: People in Somerville have adjusted over the past year and begun using reusable bags.

442
00:51:13,692 --> 00:51:14,733
[SPEAKER_02]: Which brings me to my next point.

443
00:51:15,353 --> 00:51:16,734
[SPEAKER_02]: The definition of reusable bags.

444
00:51:16,994 --> 00:51:21,496
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really important in this ordinance that we think carefully about how we want to define reusable bags.

445
00:51:22,016 --> 00:51:28,659
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, you just end up with these super thick, super large bags that get deemed reusable, and now you just have more stuff in your waste stream.

446
00:51:28,699 --> 00:51:32,060
[SPEAKER_02]: It costs more money to fix it, and it's just not the route you want to go down.

447
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:33,801
[SPEAKER_02]: So the phrasing of this ordinance is important.

448
00:51:35,128 --> 00:51:43,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Which brings me to my last point, which is I advocate for establishing a mandatory uniform fee for recycled paper bags and a mandatory minimum charge for reusable bags.

449
00:51:44,531 --> 00:51:55,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, the reasons behind this are in the Equinox Center report, and people look at this and they say, well, this is gonna target low-income households more than the average person.

450
00:51:55,834 --> 00:52:04,217
[SPEAKER_02]: The report found that over the first year after a bag ban, your average household spent $7.68 buying all the reusable bags they need for the year.

451
00:52:04,837 --> 00:52:08,340
[SPEAKER_02]: not a lot of money, but you can still make an argument, why are we putting on due costs?

452
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:12,084
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you don't wanna go that route, you can certainly do a bag giveaway.

453
00:52:12,164 --> 00:52:16,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Some towns do that within the first year to two years of the plan as well.

454
00:52:16,608 --> 00:52:23,214
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, I'd like to share that report with you all at some point, but I do thank you for having me here tonight, and again, thank you for the high school students.

455
00:52:23,654 --> 00:52:23,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

456
00:52:30,853 --> 00:52:33,094
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening, name and address of the record, please.

457
00:52:33,114 --> 00:52:36,936
[SPEAKER_18]: Susan, sorry, Susan Altman, 201 Winthrop Street, Medford.

458
00:52:37,396 --> 00:52:55,344
[SPEAKER_18]: I've been a Medford resident for 28 years, graduated from Tufts in environmental policy in the 90s, and have been on the Medford Energy Committee, was one of the founders of Green Medford, and several other environmental efforts in the city.

459
00:52:55,384 --> 00:52:58,185
[SPEAKER_18]: My current job position is managing editor for

460
00:52:58,785 --> 00:53:04,249
[SPEAKER_18]: an academic journal published by MIT Press called Global Environmental Politics.

461
00:53:04,909 --> 00:53:14,455
[SPEAKER_18]: I just want to add something from the news that you may not otherwise think about that I think is also an important consideration at this time.

462
00:53:15,016 --> 00:53:21,260
[SPEAKER_18]: China has recently announced severe restrictions on plastic waste that they will take from other countries.

463
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:24,502
[SPEAKER_18]: They have, up to this point, taken 45% of all the waste

464
00:53:27,023 --> 00:53:45,715
[SPEAKER_18]: that the United States has created, plastic waste, and that will probably drop precipitously, leaving very little of a market for plastics that are already marginal, of marginal economic value in this country for the recycling stream.

465
00:53:45,875 --> 00:53:53,639
[SPEAKER_18]: So what this will effectively do is cause much more waste to get into our environment,

466
00:53:57,386 --> 00:54:08,315
[SPEAKER_18]: cause more litter, cause more potential harm to animals, and just generally be a bigger and bigger problem as time goes on, and we create more and more waste.

467
00:54:08,435 --> 00:54:21,466
[SPEAKER_18]: So this is a great time to be thinking about it, and I'm happy to pass on to Councilor Falco and anyone else who's interested, some sources for the China information, if you're interested.

468
00:54:21,766 --> 00:54:22,066
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

469
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:44,507
[SPEAKER_22]: Good evening Tom Lincoln 27 and Gleason Street and Snowy Medford first I want to say how impressed I am by our high school students It's been marvelous to see them working on this how they've grabbed this issue and run with it this evening

470
00:54:46,268 --> 00:54:59,641
[SPEAKER_22]: I've been involved in recycling in Medford for a long time, first with the drop-off recycling in the 90s, then the small curbside bins, if you remember those, and finally as the head of the Trash and Recycling Commission when Medford adopted its current containerized system.

471
00:55:00,421 --> 00:55:10,110
[SPEAKER_22]: The City Council has been supportive all along the way, and I hope they will continue this excellent track record by adopting, and quickly adopting, a plastic bag ordinance.

472
00:55:10,971 --> 00:55:17,835
[SPEAKER_22]: A little personal experience here, I shop at Market Basket in Somerville for their excellent prices and charming parking lot.

473
00:55:19,056 --> 00:55:23,998
[SPEAKER_22]: I have watched their transition in the last while to a plastic bag-free system.

474
00:55:24,679 --> 00:55:36,646
[SPEAKER_22]: At first, a lot of people took the paper bags that they supply, but now almost everyone seems to bring in reusable cloth or vinyl bags, sometimes a whole pile of them, and no one complains and things move along quite nicely.

475
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:38,787
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a very busy store if you've ever been there.

476
00:55:39,767 --> 00:55:47,253
[SPEAKER_22]: And I have to say, I bet Market Basket itself has saved a bundle and spends less time picking up bags in their charming parking lot.

477
00:55:48,234 --> 00:55:55,420
[SPEAKER_22]: I also imagine that the biggest purveyors of single-use bags in Medford are probably Stop and Shop and the new Wegmans.

478
00:55:56,060 --> 00:56:01,422
[SPEAKER_22]: But I would note that both these stores also operate in cities with bagged ordinances.

479
00:56:01,682 --> 00:56:05,984
[SPEAKER_22]: Wegmans in Newton, and Stop and Shop in Arlington, and I think some other places.

480
00:56:06,064 --> 00:56:07,985
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't go to Stop and Shop.

481
00:56:08,045 --> 00:56:13,987
[SPEAKER_22]: Arlington, by the way, passed their ordinance last April on a vote of 188 to 21, which I thought was interesting.

482
00:56:16,288 --> 00:56:17,849
[SPEAKER_22]: This is a straightforward proposal.

483
00:56:17,869 --> 00:56:22,830
[SPEAKER_22]: There's some details to work out, but we have the guidance from 60 other cities and towns.

484
00:56:22,910 --> 00:56:29,792
[SPEAKER_22]: It's simple, it's practical, and it will have real practical impact on our local, regional, and environment.

485
00:56:30,012 --> 00:56:37,154
[SPEAKER_22]: I think it's time that Medford join these other 61 cities and towns and looking forward to progress.

486
00:56:37,274 --> 00:56:37,594
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

487
00:56:38,235 --> 00:56:38,535
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

488
00:56:46,536 --> 00:56:49,059
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening, my name is Ken Krause.

489
00:56:49,159 --> 00:56:51,562
[SPEAKER_13]: I live at 50 Mystic Street in Medford.

490
00:56:52,062 --> 00:56:57,548
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll try not to repeat what has been said much or all of which I agree with.

491
00:56:58,249 --> 00:57:03,014
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to thank Councilor Falco for this resolution, which I support.

492
00:57:03,074 --> 00:57:04,555
[SPEAKER_13]: I think the key to the success

493
00:57:05,656 --> 00:57:24,170
[SPEAKER_13]: Will be what's spelled out in the last paragraph where Councilor Falco lists all the different constituents and stakeholder groups that have a lot that they can offer toward crafting a resolution or a ordinance that works for everyone in Medford and

494
00:57:24,630 --> 00:57:39,670
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I think what we're really looking at is, this is almost an interim step, what we're really looking at is more of a societal or a cultural change, much like has already occurred in other parts of the world.

495
00:57:40,270 --> 00:57:47,975
[SPEAKER_13]: where we eliminate this habit of ours of using bags that are supplied at the point of sale.

496
00:57:48,636 --> 00:57:56,401
[SPEAKER_13]: And we use other bags that we bring or store supply that can be reused.

497
00:57:56,501 --> 00:58:00,684
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm old enough to remember when we didn't have alternatives to paper bags.

498
00:58:00,804 --> 00:58:02,165
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's all we had when we shop.

499
00:58:02,205 --> 00:58:07,449
[SPEAKER_13]: But now we've got little bags, you know, as small as this that can fit in your pocket.

500
00:58:08,149 --> 00:58:16,975
[SPEAKER_13]: fit in your glove box, if you're driving, can easily be utilized for just about any kind of purchase that you need.

501
00:58:17,055 --> 00:58:25,680
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's just more of a factor of getting in the habit of using these instead of the bags that we've gotten so accustomed to having at the checkout.

502
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:32,784
[SPEAKER_13]: And as was mentioned, this is hugely economically beneficial for the retail establishments.

503
00:58:32,804 --> 00:58:34,766
[SPEAKER_13]: They currently spend

504
00:58:35,686 --> 00:58:50,042
[SPEAKER_13]: thousands, tens, hundreds of thousands of dollars purchasing these bags, storing them in their warehouses, hiring employees to take them out of the packages and put them out in the checkout lanes, and then giving up

505
00:58:50,903 --> 00:59:04,393
[SPEAKER_13]: space in their floor to have bins where people can bring them back and then paying people to empty the bins and take them to the recycling pickup area and paying someone awfully oftentimes to take these bags back.

506
00:59:04,413 --> 00:59:08,136
[SPEAKER_13]: So they're very supportive of this changeover.

507
00:59:08,176 --> 00:59:10,738
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why we see places like Whole Foods actually

508
00:59:11,338 --> 00:59:24,246
[SPEAKER_13]: Giving you five cents off your purchase if you bring your own bag because it's cheaper for them to pay you a nickel Than to provide the bags for you market basket They sell bags for ten cents that can be reused for a while.

509
00:59:24,306 --> 00:59:30,430
[SPEAKER_13]: They were offering boxes in the store to allow you to use those to take your

510
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:38,472
[SPEAKER_13]: Groceries home and because it's cheaper for them for you to take the box home for them than to have them break them down And send them out to be recycled.

511
00:59:38,492 --> 00:59:43,253
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's a lot of support across all Aspects of our community.

512
00:59:43,393 --> 00:59:44,294
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a good thing.

513
00:59:44,334 --> 00:59:56,597
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a win-win-win for everybody There are some issues to be ironed out for different types of establishments to make this work but I think with the approach that councillor Falco laid out in his resolution and

514
00:59:56,897 --> 01:00:01,340
[SPEAKER_13]: we can do that and we can have a successful ordinance that works well for everyone, so thank you.

515
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:02,260
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

516
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:11,486
[SPEAKER_20]: Good evening, name and address of the record.

517
01:00:11,506 --> 01:00:16,309
[SPEAKER_20]: Good evening, Andrew Kasten, Eddy Cushion Street, Method Mass.

518
01:00:16,349 --> 01:00:17,950
[SPEAKER_20]: Good evening, honorable Councilors.

519
01:00:19,451 --> 01:00:24,674
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Councilor Falco, for implying a good point that this plastic bag business

520
01:00:26,528 --> 01:00:33,229
[SPEAKER_20]: can be problematic and is problematic, especially when it doesn't break down for like hundreds or thousands of years.

521
01:00:35,190 --> 01:00:41,591
[SPEAKER_20]: Not to go against the grain of today's speakers, I just wanted to make some counterpoints.

522
01:00:43,331 --> 01:00:48,853
[SPEAKER_20]: Plastic bags as trash is not a good idea.

523
01:00:49,393 --> 01:00:54,874
[SPEAKER_20]: However, if this is adopted, the paper bags would be challenging to the shoppers.

524
01:00:56,683 --> 01:01:21,770
[SPEAKER_20]: Also if adopted can I bring my own plastic bag or bags to go shopping For our convenience for many safety reasons less trips in and out of the car less breakage Less trips down those long corridors from those so-called condominium hallways Things of that nature

525
01:01:24,452 --> 01:01:31,155
[SPEAKER_20]: So much for that movie, The Graduate, when he said one word, that Tustin Hoffman knows plastics.

526
01:01:31,535 --> 01:01:37,178
[SPEAKER_20]: I guess some inventions are not that great after all, or maybe we have to reinvent it or cancel them out.

527
01:01:38,078 --> 01:01:46,302
[SPEAKER_20]: And just thinking out of the box, by the way, maybe God made man to invent plastic, because I don't know why.

528
01:01:51,049 --> 01:01:51,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

529
01:01:53,091 --> 01:01:54,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scalpelli.

530
01:01:54,392 --> 01:01:55,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

531
01:01:55,133 --> 01:01:56,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, thank you, Councilor Falco and this board.

532
01:01:57,556 --> 01:02:11,010
[SPEAKER_03]: As I went and contacted a few of the neighboring communities that already have adopted this ordinance, it's astonishing that what we're saying is what they're seeing.

533
01:02:12,291 --> 01:02:16,553
[SPEAKER_03]: The comment of the impact of the carbon footprint isn't even discussed yet.

534
01:02:17,733 --> 01:02:24,957
[SPEAKER_03]: The discussion in Somerville that we're seeing is the education factor and what people are learning and what kids are picking up.

535
01:02:25,738 --> 01:02:37,384
[SPEAKER_03]: And as you look and read in some of their community meetings that they've held, a lot of our seniors made the simple fact that they didn't remember plastic bags, they brought their own bags.

536
01:02:40,865 --> 01:03:00,218
[SPEAKER_03]: This generation, our generation, our young generation, thanks to Mr. and Mrs. Lasky, I know I left my house this morning and John and I were talking, my son who's 14 years old, he wants to make sure he leads the initiative with Mr. Lasky to make sure we can swim in the Mystic Lakes, thanks to a project they did.

537
01:03:00,298 --> 01:03:03,401
[SPEAKER_03]: So part of that, as I left, he said, Dad, what about doggie bags?

538
01:03:04,221 --> 01:03:09,945
[SPEAKER_03]: What about the recycling of those bags?

539
01:03:10,345 --> 01:03:15,168
[SPEAKER_03]: This starts a great discussion throughout our community and especially with our youth.

540
01:03:16,529 --> 01:03:19,111
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is a great initiative.

541
01:03:22,743 --> 01:03:31,926
[SPEAKER_03]: I applaud our students at Medford High School and Mr. Toon, who leads that group, because I think that's where this all really starts.

542
01:03:32,146 --> 01:03:33,707
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the base of this.

543
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:36,188
[SPEAKER_03]: So I really applaud that and commend you.

544
01:03:36,248 --> 01:03:36,928
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.

545
01:03:37,969 --> 01:03:38,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

546
01:03:39,590 --> 01:03:41,171
[SPEAKER_09]: So nice, Mr. President.

547
01:03:41,191 --> 01:03:41,912
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

548
01:03:42,392 --> 01:04:02,867
[SPEAKER_09]: I certainly don't think I'd have a very difficult time supporting him being a bag man here in the city of Medford But in order to do that, I think we need to get to work and I'm council Falco made a great suggestion that we refer this to the zoning The I'm sorry the ordinance subcommittee, mr. President But I think that it might make sense for us to request that the city solicitor put a draft together for us in conjunction with our office of energy in the environment

549
01:04:03,207 --> 01:04:04,908
[SPEAKER_09]: so that we can have some place to start.

550
01:04:05,688 --> 01:04:13,610
[SPEAKER_09]: We can have the city solicitor put a draft together for us in the appropriate form with the appropriate legal ask that's necessary, and then we can take it from there, Mr. President.

551
01:04:13,630 --> 01:04:15,431
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'd like to amend Councilor Falco's resolution.

552
01:04:15,511 --> 01:04:25,034
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just asking that instead of it going to the ordinance subcommittee right away, it goes to the city solicitor for a draft, and then upon receipt of the draft, we can refer it to the ordinance subcommittee to get working.

553
01:04:26,754 --> 01:04:27,174
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

554
01:04:28,255 --> 01:04:28,855
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilman Gauker?

555
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:33,401
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, President Caraviello, and thank you, Councilor Falco, for bringing this forward.

556
01:04:34,282 --> 01:04:41,005
[SPEAKER_23]: My comments are the same as on the same lines as Councilor Knight with regards to just where we send it first.

557
01:04:41,265 --> 01:04:49,268
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know if it makes my suggestion would be that we send it to Committee of the Whole after we have a week or two to review some of the neighboring cities.

558
01:04:50,148 --> 01:04:53,569
[SPEAKER_23]: in towns ordinances so that we can get an idea of what we want.

559
01:04:53,629 --> 01:04:59,891
[SPEAKER_23]: I know that when you just even read the bullet points, it talks about compliance and warning notices.

560
01:05:00,351 --> 01:05:01,771
[SPEAKER_23]: Some cities and towns give a warning.

561
01:05:01,851 --> 01:05:04,832
[SPEAKER_23]: Some cities and towns give a fine right away.

562
01:05:05,272 --> 01:05:09,773
[SPEAKER_23]: Some cities and towns, I know Cambridge charges the 10 cents per bag if you want to buy one.

563
01:05:09,793 --> 01:05:12,394
[SPEAKER_23]: And I know Somerville doesn't at all.

564
01:05:12,414 --> 01:05:15,595
[SPEAKER_23]: So there's different things that I think we maybe could

565
01:05:16,735 --> 01:05:25,622
[SPEAKER_23]: go through in a nice hour and a half meeting, discuss, and then send right to our solicitor and say, hey, this is what we're, this is the outline of the ordinance that we'd like to pass.

566
01:05:25,942 --> 01:05:35,550
[SPEAKER_23]: So I think that's something that may be a thought of mine to make it move faster than sending it to subcommittee in ordinances, then to the solicitor, then to committee of the whole.

567
01:05:35,970 --> 01:05:42,635
[SPEAKER_23]: Just an idea, but I think it's definitely worth pursuing, and I am interested to learn more, and I thank the public for getting involved.

568
01:05:44,475 --> 01:05:45,796
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor.

569
01:05:46,456 --> 01:05:48,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Chair recognizes President Caraviello.

570
01:05:49,138 --> 01:05:49,898
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

571
01:05:49,918 --> 01:05:52,199
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to thank Councilor Falco for his leadership on this.

572
01:05:54,240 --> 01:06:04,526
[SPEAKER_06]: My wife and myself have been recycling since we got those new barrels, and from a person who never recycled, now my wife recycles, we recycle everything.

573
01:06:06,407 --> 01:06:12,431
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think the hardest thing is going to be with stores fighting this.

574
01:06:12,451 --> 01:06:19,875
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll probably see the small convenience stores fighting this versus the big box stores where it doesn't really affect them that much.

575
01:06:20,295 --> 01:06:25,178
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, I want to thank Councilor Falco for this and he has all my support also.

576
01:06:26,439 --> 01:06:31,902
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of approval by Councilor Falco, seconded and amended by Councilor Knight.

577
01:06:34,863 --> 01:06:35,444
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you want a roll call?

578
01:06:36,399 --> 01:06:39,972
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you want to speak if we so if we made this seems to be.

579
01:06:42,265 --> 01:06:45,846
[SPEAKER_16]: a little discussion, I guess, as to where they should go next.

580
01:06:46,806 --> 01:06:58,929
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know for me, one of the big pieces of this resolution in coming up with a final resolution and adopting resolution is to make sure there's involvement from the different groups that are here tonight.

581
01:07:00,189 --> 01:07:03,210
[SPEAKER_16]: Because a lot of these people here tonight are on the front lines.

582
01:07:03,250 --> 01:07:05,070
[SPEAKER_16]: They have experience in this area.

583
01:07:06,031 --> 01:07:07,551
[SPEAKER_16]: They've researched this already.

584
01:07:07,891 --> 01:07:10,072
[SPEAKER_16]: So I want to make sure that they're involved, and that's important.

585
01:07:14,316 --> 01:07:18,082
[SPEAKER_16]: I think at this point the best bet is why don't we

586
01:07:19,216 --> 01:07:23,417
[SPEAKER_16]: move it to Committee of the Whole, get input from, actually no, let's do this.

587
01:07:23,837 --> 01:07:41,603
[SPEAKER_16]: I think the best thing is, let's go to City Solicitor Romley, let's get a draft first of what we think it should be, what he thinks would be a good way to start, I guess, looking at other resolutions, or other ordinances, I guess, from other cities, and then we'll push it to Committee of the Whole to have, I think, probably the Council weigh in, and then,

588
01:07:44,454 --> 01:07:49,876
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to make sure there's plenty of community involvement.

589
01:07:49,896 --> 01:07:57,498
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a lot of groups here, a lot of people here that are interested in something, that are interested in the ordinance, but I want to make sure that we're starting off with something.

590
01:07:57,978 --> 01:08:02,139
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think if we all get into a room, we're just throwing thoughts and ideas around, it could get kind of messy.

591
01:08:02,199 --> 01:08:05,880
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm thinking if we start off with getting some sort of a draft resolution,

592
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:15,423
[SPEAKER_16]: from the city solicitor, and then from that point, we can get together and bring in the groups and the council as well to give input.

593
01:08:16,183 --> 01:08:16,623
[SPEAKER_15]: Excellent.

594
01:08:18,004 --> 01:08:21,225
[SPEAKER_15]: And that in no way goes contrary to the amendment.

595
01:08:21,645 --> 01:08:22,925
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

596
01:08:26,046 --> 01:08:32,128
[SPEAKER_15]: Refer to the city solicitor, and then to convene a committee of the whole with suitable input.

597
01:08:33,443 --> 01:08:35,005
[SPEAKER_15]: with a draft from the solicitor.

598
01:08:35,065 --> 01:08:36,586
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Scarpelli on that motion?

599
01:08:37,528 --> 01:08:48,119
[SPEAKER_03]: If I could, I want to make sure that we make sure that our student, our Medford High School student is part of that committee with us and make sure that... That's clear in the resolution.

600
01:08:48,159 --> 01:08:48,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

601
01:08:51,082 --> 01:08:57,703
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, that would be the that would be the point of bringing it back to community the whole because I want to make sure that each consulate gets to weigh in.

602
01:08:58,283 --> 01:09:04,625
[SPEAKER_16]: But I want to make sure that the residents get to weigh in, especially, you know, rubia and the students at Bedford High School that have been working on this.

603
01:09:05,085 --> 01:09:09,266
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I believe you've got a number of you had a petition that went out as well.

604
01:09:10,106 --> 01:09:13,066
[SPEAKER_16]: So a lot of people are interested in this and it needs to be addressed.

605
01:09:13,166 --> 01:09:15,967
[SPEAKER_16]: But I want to make sure there's plenty of community involvement.

606
01:09:16,387 --> 01:09:20,830
[SPEAKER_03]: So the neighboring communities had a heavy public participation piece.

607
01:09:20,870 --> 01:09:22,252
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry?

608
01:09:22,272 --> 01:09:27,916
[SPEAKER_03]: The neighboring communities that have adopted this had a very heavy public participation piece.

609
01:09:27,996 --> 01:09:29,137
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's what this is all about.

610
01:09:29,157 --> 01:09:31,939
[SPEAKER_16]: There are a lot of people that want to weigh in on this issue.

611
01:09:31,959 --> 01:09:35,621
[SPEAKER_16]: But I think we need to start somewhere.

612
01:09:35,721 --> 01:09:36,842
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think if we have a draft.

613
01:09:38,484 --> 01:09:38,924
[SPEAKER_16]: Exactly.

614
01:09:39,004 --> 01:09:42,328
[SPEAKER_16]: So I mean, I think we have a bunch of people in a room just firing ideas around.

615
01:09:42,368 --> 01:09:43,610
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that might get kind of messy.

616
01:09:43,630 --> 01:09:50,137
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think if we have some sort of a draft resolution first and then we can make adjustments and changes, that would probably be the best.

617
01:09:50,538 --> 01:09:52,260
[SPEAKER_16]: Every ordinance goes through three readings.

618
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:53,181
[SPEAKER_16]: Absolutely.

619
01:09:53,601 --> 01:09:55,583
[SPEAKER_15]: Those are the rules on the motion.

620
01:09:55,623 --> 01:09:56,725
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

621
01:10:01,156 --> 01:10:01,876
[SPEAKER_11]: President Caraviello.

622
01:10:02,036 --> 01:10:02,257
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

623
01:10:03,137 --> 01:10:03,837
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Falco.

624
01:10:03,917 --> 01:10:04,118
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

625
01:10:04,478 --> 01:10:04,978
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight.

626
01:10:05,078 --> 01:10:05,358
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

627
01:10:05,798 --> 01:10:06,519
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Woodcurt.

628
01:10:06,579 --> 01:10:06,799
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

629
01:10:07,219 --> 01:10:07,820
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Marks.

630
01:10:08,020 --> 01:10:08,300
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

631
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:09,861
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Scarpelli.

632
01:10:09,921 --> 01:10:10,201
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

633
01:10:10,481 --> 01:10:11,381
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Calderon.

634
01:10:11,501 --> 01:10:11,922
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

635
01:10:12,022 --> 01:10:16,364
[SPEAKER_15]: With a vote of seven in the affirmative, none in the negative, the motion passes as amended.

636
01:10:16,384 --> 01:10:23,648
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Charlie.

637
01:10:26,385 --> 01:10:28,527
[SPEAKER_15]: 18-062, offered by President Caraviello.

638
01:10:29,207 --> 01:10:42,735
[SPEAKER_15]: Be it resolved the Medford City Council request that the Mayor and City Solicitor look into joining the lawsuit that other cities have joined against the pharmaceutical companies that have flooded the city with opioids.

639
01:10:43,755 --> 01:10:44,436
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President.

640
01:10:44,676 --> 01:10:45,457
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

641
01:10:45,777 --> 01:11:00,249
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if many people watched about a month ago, I think it was 2020, did a special on how these big pharmaceutical companies have flooded markets and really fueled this opioid addiction problem.

642
01:11:01,110 --> 01:11:08,756
[SPEAKER_06]: And last week, Councilor Falco and myself attended the MMA show, and there was a law firm there

643
01:11:09,637 --> 01:11:22,034
[SPEAKER_06]: that is doing a class action suit against the pharmaceutical companies for different cities and towns to help alleviate this.

644
01:11:22,094 --> 01:11:25,118
[SPEAKER_06]: And since I'm doing a little bit of research, I found out that

645
01:11:25,899 --> 01:11:34,124
[SPEAKER_06]: There's about a half a dozen major law firms that are doing these class action suits against the pharmaceutical companies.

646
01:11:34,144 --> 01:11:48,653
[SPEAKER_06]: So at this point I'm asking that the mayor and our city solicitor look into joining one of these lawsuits to help our city maybe get some funds to help with this problem in Medford.

647
01:11:56,061 --> 01:11:57,446
[SPEAKER_23]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

648
01:11:57,486 --> 01:11:59,192
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Vice President Dello Russo.

649
01:11:59,293 --> 01:12:01,701
[SPEAKER_23]: So the lawsuit is to

650
01:12:03,662 --> 01:12:09,204
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a class action lawsuit against the major pharmaceutical companies for monetary damages.

651
01:12:09,244 --> 01:12:12,384
[SPEAKER_23]: For money to come back to the cities and towns to fight the epidemic?

652
01:12:12,845 --> 01:12:13,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

653
01:12:13,465 --> 01:12:28,589
[SPEAKER_06]: As I say, Councilor Falco and I attended the show last week and we did meet with one of the law firms that is doing one, but in doing my research I found that there's about half a dozen firms representing different cities and towns all against these major pharmaceutical companies.

654
01:12:30,110 --> 01:12:33,952
[SPEAKER_06]: and hopefully they'll have some monetary damages.

655
01:12:34,853 --> 01:12:48,002
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the major outcomes of such large interest and involvement in battling the opioid crisis in our nation is the coming to light of the fact that

656
01:12:48,642 --> 01:12:57,304
[SPEAKER_15]: The pharmaceutical companies presented false information to the medical community regarding the addictiveness of these drugs.

657
01:12:57,825 --> 01:13:07,607
[SPEAKER_15]: And where they were prescribed en masse in the mid to late 1990s resulted in a lot of the addictive cycles that we've seen develop in society.

658
01:13:08,127 --> 01:13:12,008
[SPEAKER_15]: And so, Mr. President, this is great leadership as usual.

659
01:13:12,469 --> 01:13:16,730
[SPEAKER_15]: So on the motion of approval by President Caraviello, seconded by?

660
01:13:17,790 --> 01:13:28,443
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Falco mr. President roll call has been requested mr. Clerk, please call the roll Yes

661
01:13:31,003 --> 01:13:31,884
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Falco?

662
01:13:32,044 --> 01:13:32,505
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

663
01:13:32,645 --> 01:13:33,206
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight?

664
01:13:33,266 --> 01:13:33,566
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

665
01:13:33,986 --> 01:13:34,707
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Kern?

666
01:13:34,807 --> 01:13:35,148
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

667
01:13:35,488 --> 01:13:36,309
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Markswell?

668
01:13:36,389 --> 01:13:36,469
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

669
01:13:36,690 --> 01:13:37,490
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Scarpelli?

670
01:13:37,611 --> 01:13:37,971
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

671
01:13:38,071 --> 01:13:38,972
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Dello Russo?

672
01:13:39,052 --> 01:13:39,393
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

673
01:13:39,473 --> 01:13:42,917
[SPEAKER_15]: With a vote of seven in the affirmative, none in the negative, motion passes.

674
01:13:43,597 --> 01:13:47,422
[SPEAKER_15]: And the vice president now relinquishes the chair to the president.

675
01:13:48,603 --> 01:13:49,444
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

676
01:13:49,464 --> 01:13:50,585
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Scarpelli, Mr. President?

677
01:13:50,605 --> 01:13:50,645
[SPEAKER_06]: 8-0-7.

678
01:13:52,768 --> 01:13:54,791
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion by Councilor Knight for suspension of the rules.

679
01:13:54,852 --> 01:13:55,613
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

680
01:13:57,596 --> 01:13:58,117
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

681
01:13:58,457 --> 01:13:59,679
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Knight.

682
01:13:59,699 --> 01:14:02,844
[SPEAKER_08]: 18067, looks like we have a presentation there from the City Clerk and Chief Elections Officer.

683
01:14:05,016 --> 01:14:10,100
[SPEAKER_06]: 1-8-0-6-7 from Edward P. Finn, City Clerk, Chief Election Officer.

684
01:14:10,781 --> 01:14:32,179
[SPEAKER_06]: Dear Councilors, pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws 54, Section 34, use of voting machines by cities and towns, that the Medford City Council, on behalf of the City of Medford, respectfully request and hereby discontinues the use of AccuVote voting machines and adopts the use of

685
01:14:32,959 --> 01:14:40,843
[SPEAKER_06]: the image cast precinct tabulator commencing at the September 4th, 2018 state primary election.

686
01:14:40,903 --> 01:14:43,945
[SPEAKER_06]: I will be able to answer any questions at the council meeting.

687
01:14:44,465 --> 01:14:46,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Yours truly, Edward P. Finn, City Clerk.

688
01:14:46,766 --> 01:14:48,908
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clerk, would you like to give us a little synopsis?

689
01:14:51,549 --> 01:14:57,152
[SPEAKER_11]: As you're aware, part of the capital improvement plan submitted last year was to

690
01:15:02,011 --> 01:15:07,732
[SPEAKER_11]: We go out to bid to secure new voting equipment for all 16 precincts.

691
01:15:08,573 --> 01:15:18,435
[SPEAKER_11]: Our prior equipment, the Acuvo, was purchased 1993 in use for the 1994 election, so it has some age on it.

692
01:15:19,395 --> 01:15:27,397
[SPEAKER_11]: We did secure the image cast precinct tabulator.

693
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:45,846
[SPEAKER_11]: And by law, by mass general law, the council has to decertify AccuVote and get the image cast ready for the September 4th state primary.

694
01:15:48,606 --> 01:15:50,047
[SPEAKER_06]: Does anyone have any questions for the clerk?

695
01:15:52,948 --> 01:15:59,114
[SPEAKER_06]: on the motion by Councilor Knights, seconded by Councilor Falco.

696
01:15:59,855 --> 01:16:00,956
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

697
01:16:06,602 --> 01:16:07,623
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Dello Russo?

698
01:16:09,645 --> 01:16:10,385
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Falco?

699
01:16:10,646 --> 01:16:10,846
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

700
01:16:11,326 --> 01:16:11,887
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knights?

701
01:16:11,947 --> 01:16:12,507
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

702
01:16:12,648 --> 01:16:13,368
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Kern?

703
01:16:13,408 --> 01:16:13,508
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

704
01:16:14,069 --> 01:16:14,690
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Marks?

705
01:16:14,710 --> 01:16:15,110
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

706
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:16,441
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Scarpelli?

707
01:16:16,581 --> 01:16:16,801
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

708
01:16:17,102 --> 01:16:17,903
[SPEAKER_06]: President Caraviello?

709
01:16:18,103 --> 01:16:18,363
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

710
01:16:18,483 --> 01:16:21,427
[SPEAKER_06]: And Councilor Dello Russo has come back into the room?

711
01:16:21,447 --> 01:16:21,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

712
01:16:22,268 --> 01:16:25,412
[SPEAKER_06]: And Councilor Dello Russo votes yes.

713
01:16:25,993 --> 01:16:27,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

714
01:16:28,255 --> 01:16:29,457
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

715
01:16:29,477 --> 01:16:29,497
[SPEAKER_06]: 18-065.

716
01:16:33,068 --> 01:16:42,754
[SPEAKER_06]: Petition by Joseph Viglione, 59 Garfield Avenue, Medford, Mass., to address the City Council to speak on restrictions on public access TV.

717
01:16:43,574 --> 01:16:44,675
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening, Mr. Viglione.

718
01:16:44,695 --> 01:16:45,936
[SPEAKER_21]: Name and address for the record, please.

719
01:16:46,076 --> 01:16:46,836
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, good evening.

720
01:16:46,916 --> 01:16:50,639
[SPEAKER_21]: Joe Viglione, 59 Garfield Avenue, Medford, Mass.

721
01:16:50,979 --> 01:16:57,623
[SPEAKER_21]: The City Council, which handles the finances, must diligently oversee the city-owned and operated access TV station.

722
01:16:58,694 --> 01:17:06,437
[SPEAKER_21]: The city used the station from June of 2017, but only opened the public side, which funded it October 15, 2017.

723
01:17:06,577 --> 01:17:11,659
[SPEAKER_21]: I just want to clarify for the record, the city has about

724
01:17:12,893 --> 01:17:14,894
[SPEAKER_21]: 60% of the money is going into the general fund.

725
01:17:15,775 --> 01:17:19,476
[SPEAKER_21]: I believe the government channel money is going to pay for free teacher salaries.

726
01:17:19,976 --> 01:17:31,422
[SPEAKER_21]: So all we have left is the $200,000, which a former city councilor, myself, and another resident saved this city when we brought forward the complaints against the former entity that ran it.

727
01:17:32,462 --> 01:17:38,131
[SPEAKER_21]: So, we have all this money, 700 grand or so, that belongs to the public station.

728
01:17:38,631 --> 01:17:43,178
[SPEAKER_21]: What appears to be happening is, it's funding the government and the educational channel.

729
01:17:43,739 --> 01:17:47,505
[SPEAKER_21]: This city council now has jurisdiction because

730
01:17:48,900 --> 01:17:52,443
[SPEAKER_21]: The issuing authority, the mayor, is running the station, not a 501c3.

731
01:17:53,364 --> 01:17:57,627
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'd like to know where this money's going, and I don't wanna see this motion tabled.

732
01:17:57,707 --> 01:18:02,331
[SPEAKER_21]: I am requesting that this council get proactive and say, hey, this is a city resource.

733
01:18:02,771 --> 01:18:04,592
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, I agree with Councilor Caraviello.

734
01:18:04,632 --> 01:18:05,593
[SPEAKER_21]: He had two ideas.

735
01:18:06,594 --> 01:18:08,215
[SPEAKER_21]: One was to put it at Springstep.

736
01:18:08,776 --> 01:18:11,177
[SPEAKER_21]: One was to put it at the library, which is a great idea.

737
01:18:12,458 --> 01:18:18,921
[SPEAKER_21]: Our city solicitor wrote in the Medford transcript, was quoted in the Medford transcript that couldn't do it.

738
01:18:18,961 --> 01:18:21,221
[SPEAKER_21]: There was an agreement with the family that bestowed the land.

739
01:18:21,722 --> 01:18:32,206
[SPEAKER_21]: No, my understanding was that the computers at the library that currently are there mean that you could have more computers upstairs for public access.

740
01:18:32,226 --> 01:18:38,588
[SPEAKER_21]: So, my solution to this is in Arlington, Mass., there is a satellite station across the street from the high school

741
01:18:39,924 --> 01:18:45,066
[SPEAKER_21]: The main station is up in East Arlington at the old library, and it works perfectly.

742
01:18:45,526 --> 01:18:53,730
[SPEAKER_21]: So if the mayor wants to have her station at the high school, it's already been built, so it's kind of like, well, we use the money, let's build a satellite station.

743
01:18:55,031 --> 01:18:59,173
[SPEAKER_21]: A third idea, Councilor Caraviello had two ideas, I had a third idea, the Chevalier.

744
01:19:00,113 --> 01:19:06,796
[SPEAKER_21]: But I went and met with the people there, and there's a back room up on the balcony that's not used.

745
01:19:07,930 --> 01:19:10,771
[SPEAKER_21]: And this would be a perfect place for a satellite and of course a van.

746
01:19:11,271 --> 01:19:21,494
[SPEAKER_21]: When we had no access station for three years, I begged the council and the school committee, let us have a van, let us have these cameras that go instantly over the cellular wires, they don't have to go underground.

747
01:19:21,974 --> 01:19:23,495
[SPEAKER_21]: Now you would have your public access.

748
01:19:24,195 --> 01:19:34,418
[SPEAKER_21]: What I would like this city council to do is to ask, what is going on at the station since October 15th when the station opened to February 15th?

749
01:19:35,119 --> 01:19:35,759
[SPEAKER_21]: So we've got

750
01:19:37,419 --> 01:19:37,940
[SPEAKER_21]: Four months.

751
01:19:38,501 --> 01:19:40,102
[SPEAKER_21]: What have they accomplished in four months?

752
01:19:40,323 --> 01:19:41,684
[SPEAKER_21]: How much membership do we have?

753
01:19:42,505 --> 01:19:44,107
[SPEAKER_21]: How much outreach has been done?

754
01:19:44,728 --> 01:19:46,450
[SPEAKER_21]: And what's the facilitation of programming?

755
01:19:46,490 --> 01:19:50,335
[SPEAKER_21]: Because when I turn on the TV, I see public service announcements galore.

756
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:56,884
[SPEAKER_21]: I've been in AXIS since 79, which I guess you know because I've been saying it time and time again.

757
01:19:56,904 --> 01:19:59,828
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm on the air tomorrow with John Hall of Orleans.

758
01:19:59,868 --> 01:20:01,229
[SPEAKER_21]: He can sing, still the one.

759
01:20:02,150 --> 01:20:04,112
[SPEAKER_21]: And he's a return guest.

760
01:20:04,212 --> 01:20:04,793
[SPEAKER_21]: It's amazing.

761
01:20:04,813 --> 01:20:06,234
[SPEAKER_21]: The guests just keep flocking to me.

762
01:20:06,294 --> 01:20:08,196
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't even have to do any work to get guests.

763
01:20:08,256 --> 01:20:08,917
[SPEAKER_21]: They come to me.

764
01:20:09,698 --> 01:20:14,703
[SPEAKER_21]: Why doesn't Medford have this kind of flourishing AXIS activity, which in Reading,

765
01:20:15,744 --> 01:20:18,306
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a place for the community, as Bob Penta said.

766
01:20:18,947 --> 01:20:21,869
[SPEAKER_21]: Saturday mornings, the senior citizens are there having coffee.

767
01:20:22,309 --> 01:20:23,990
[SPEAKER_21]: It is an amazing old movie theater.

768
01:20:24,591 --> 01:20:30,735
[SPEAKER_21]: Now what I'm going to mail to each city councilor is the form for the application for Cambridge.

769
01:20:32,116 --> 01:20:34,458
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm working with Cambridge now on the music department.

770
01:20:34,678 --> 01:20:38,281
[SPEAKER_21]: Malden, which of course I'm working on two shows in Malden with the music department.

771
01:20:40,490 --> 01:20:46,913
[SPEAKER_21]: and other communities, so you will see them compared to Medford, and you will see how difficult it is for the residents of Medford to join.

772
01:20:47,453 --> 01:20:52,735
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, Councilor Falco's idea about the plastic bags, what a great arena to go on.

773
01:20:53,196 --> 01:21:00,299
[SPEAKER_21]: Public access TV, with this multitude of people that were here with these good solid ideas, this is what access is all about.

774
01:21:01,159 --> 01:21:06,663
[SPEAKER_21]: I've tried by taping the Energy Commission, Room 207, and other rooms.

775
01:21:06,763 --> 01:21:11,786
[SPEAKER_21]: In this here, in Alden Chambers, I've taped Facebook Live when there's been no television broadcast.

776
01:21:12,166 --> 01:21:13,487
[SPEAKER_21]: We see how valuable it is.

777
01:21:13,887 --> 01:21:18,470
[SPEAKER_21]: I was at the Midway Cafe last night in Jamaica Plain, and trust me, I did not want to go to Jamaica Plain.

778
01:21:19,350 --> 01:21:22,132
[SPEAKER_21]: But it was a Medford resident, terrific band.

779
01:21:22,432 --> 01:21:25,334
[SPEAKER_21]: The opening act, old friends of mine, I had no idea they had this new band.

780
01:21:25,374 --> 01:21:26,014
[SPEAKER_21]: It was amazing.

781
01:21:26,355 --> 01:21:27,776
[SPEAKER_21]: Facebook Live put it out there.

782
01:21:28,976 --> 01:21:31,879
[SPEAKER_21]: And everyone was happy because this is a whole new window.

783
01:21:31,939 --> 01:21:37,145
[SPEAKER_21]: If you can't get out in a snowstorm to see a band, a Medford band, and this is key.

784
01:21:37,705 --> 01:21:38,826
[SPEAKER_21]: I won't keep you too much longer.

785
01:21:39,147 --> 01:21:39,587
[SPEAKER_21]: This is key.

786
01:21:39,607 --> 01:21:41,489
[SPEAKER_21]: I had a meeting with Cambridge Cable last week.

787
01:21:41,509 --> 01:21:46,013
[SPEAKER_21]: We have a new woman in there, programming, and I told her about Facebook Live at the nightclub.

788
01:21:46,053 --> 01:21:47,675
[SPEAKER_21]: She goes, these clubs are in Cambridge, Joe.

789
01:21:47,715 --> 01:21:48,956
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's put them on the air here.

790
01:21:49,397 --> 01:21:51,239
[SPEAKER_21]: She wants to air my Facebook Live.

791
01:21:51,519 --> 01:21:52,320
[SPEAKER_21]: It is amazing.

792
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:55,441
[SPEAKER_21]: So this is cooperation, this is free speech.

793
01:21:55,961 --> 01:22:01,783
[SPEAKER_21]: We don't have it here yet, but now I can hold the city council and say, hey guys and gals, guess what?

794
01:22:02,543 --> 01:22:04,784
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey guys and gal, guess what?

795
01:22:05,664 --> 01:22:07,505
[SPEAKER_21]: The city is operating our access station.

796
01:22:07,665 --> 01:22:09,925
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's make it the best access station we can.

797
01:22:10,466 --> 01:22:11,886
[SPEAKER_21]: And right now, it's in limbo.

798
01:22:12,366 --> 01:22:17,348
[SPEAKER_21]: What I'd like this council to do is not table it, ask how many members have joined since October 15th,

799
01:22:18,588 --> 01:22:23,411
[SPEAKER_21]: What is the outreach keyword that was in the contract with Medford Community Cablevision?

800
01:22:23,572 --> 01:22:25,313
[SPEAKER_21]: Outreach, that's what they failed to do.

801
01:22:25,853 --> 01:22:28,635
[SPEAKER_21]: Facilitation of programming, classes.

802
01:22:29,476 --> 01:22:31,777
[SPEAKER_21]: Ask the station manager, how many classes have you had?

803
01:22:32,277 --> 01:22:33,258
[SPEAKER_21]: What have you taught people?

804
01:22:33,758 --> 01:22:38,422
[SPEAKER_21]: This is so important for our community, and everyone here knows how passionate I am about this.

805
01:22:39,122 --> 01:22:44,806
[SPEAKER_21]: And I put my money where my mouth is, because I'm out there doing access just about every other day, and I have been since 79.

806
01:22:46,507 --> 01:22:47,968
[SPEAKER_21]: It's important to this community.

807
01:22:48,848 --> 01:22:50,109
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you very much for hearing me.

808
01:22:50,129 --> 01:22:50,489
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

809
01:22:55,492 --> 01:22:55,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

810
01:22:58,093 --> 01:22:59,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

811
01:22:59,314 --> 01:23:12,420
[SPEAKER_23]: On that, if I could speak after our speaker, I would be interested to find out just membership and maybe just a summary of what outreach we have had.

812
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:15,122
[SPEAKER_23]: I think it's definitely something I'm curious about.

813
01:23:16,863 --> 01:23:22,508
[SPEAKER_23]: So if I could put that motion forward that just we get an update with regards to how TV3 is functioning and what the membership looks like.

814
01:23:23,589 --> 01:23:28,873
[SPEAKER_06]: The motion by Councilman O'Connor.

815
01:23:29,934 --> 01:23:32,356
[SPEAKER_06]: Just put in a motion.

816
01:23:32,376 --> 01:23:33,897
[SPEAKER_06]: She wants to know about the membership.

817
01:23:33,997 --> 01:23:34,658
