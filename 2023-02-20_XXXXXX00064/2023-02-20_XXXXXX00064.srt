[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for joining us.

11
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:52,754
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't mind just starting by introducing yourself, your name, pronouns, and who you are.

12
00:00:53,535 --> 00:00:53,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

13
00:00:54,055 --> 00:00:55,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Mayor Brianna L'Engle Kern.

[SPEAKER_02]: My pronouns are she and her, and I'm a mom, coach, and the mayor of Bedford.

15
00:01:02,707 --> 00:01:04,069
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of hats.

16
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:16,668
[SPEAKER_00]: So if, you know, you've been on our podcast a couple of times, but if you don't mind, maybe there's some updates to your answer to our usual question, but sharing what your favorite, your current favorite place to eat is in Medford and what you like to eat there.

17
00:01:18,423 --> 00:01:18,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

18
00:01:18,843 --> 00:01:26,407
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we have a lot of amazing spots in Medford, some that have been around for a long time and a few new ones.

19
00:01:26,487 --> 00:01:35,172
[SPEAKER_02]: So I love Bocelli's, their salad and had a marinara and then I've been frequenting the Ford lately.

20
00:01:35,192 --> 00:01:36,552
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did get like a

21
00:01:37,853 --> 00:01:39,995
[SPEAKER_02]: seafood dish there that was, was amazing.

22
00:01:40,055 --> 00:01:50,924
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have changed their menu a number of times to try to, they're working through it to make sure it's on par, but I really enjoy the atmosphere and time I have at the Ford.

23
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:51,744
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

24
00:01:52,024 --> 00:01:52,405
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool place.

25
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:56,628
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen them do a couple like events for where you can bring your kids and like programs for kids.

26
00:01:56,688 --> 00:01:57,349
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds cool.

27
00:01:57,389 --> 00:01:57,549
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

28
00:01:58,029 --> 00:01:58,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

29
00:01:58,569 --> 00:02:02,392
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually, my other hat is Elsa might be there on the 21st.

30
00:02:02,432 --> 00:02:04,573
[SPEAKER_02]: They're doing a character, character dinner.

31
00:02:04,633 --> 00:02:04,913
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

32
00:02:05,493 --> 00:02:05,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

33
00:02:06,254 --> 00:02:06,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.

34
00:02:06,874 --> 00:02:07,294
[SPEAKER_00]: Kiddos.

35
00:02:07,434 --> 00:02:07,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

36
00:02:09,436 --> 00:02:09,696
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.

37
00:02:09,776 --> 00:02:14,819
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were hoping to kind of use this time to reflect a little bit on your state of the city speech.

38
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:19,421
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to share any highlights from what you shared that night, we'd love to hear them.

39
00:02:19,461 --> 00:02:22,303
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe we can just have a little bit of a discussion around that.

40
00:02:23,113 --> 00:02:23,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, sure.

41
00:02:23,794 --> 00:02:26,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, the state of the city address.

42
00:02:26,056 --> 00:02:36,265
[SPEAKER_02]: I think my communications director, Steve, and assistant Emma and I wrote a speech and it was probably say 15, 20 pages.

43
00:02:36,686 --> 00:02:41,550
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was really hard to narrow it down to a good 10 pages because that's about 25 minutes.

44
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:45,594
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that just goes to show what I tried to highlight in the speech.

45
00:02:45,734 --> 00:02:46,595
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to highlight.

46
00:02:47,195 --> 00:02:57,564
[SPEAKER_02]: all the amazing employees we have here, our department heads and everybody in City Hall and those who work outside of City Hall that are just doing amazing work in Medford.

47
00:02:57,644 --> 00:03:04,850
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was what the speech was about, highlighting, you know, everything that people have been doing, such as planning, development and sustainability.

48
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:09,514
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they're helping us with improving our business districts through the facade grant program.

49
00:03:09,955 --> 00:03:13,518
[SPEAKER_02]: They are making sure we have charging stations that

50
00:03:14,018 --> 00:03:15,739
[SPEAKER_02]: And that network continues to grow.

51
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:23,785
[SPEAKER_02]: That they, along with Todd Blake, our director of traffic and transportation, are making sure our blue bike network is growing.

52
00:03:23,825 --> 00:03:32,231
[SPEAKER_02]: And just got word yesterday from him that we're going to, this year, 2023, we will be surpassing many communities with that, with our network.

53
00:03:32,431 --> 00:03:41,638
[SPEAKER_02]: We have another multiple going in very soon, and then we just have plans to, we keep applying for grants and obtaining grants and really getting strategic with

54
00:03:42,118 --> 00:03:48,680
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the funding sources we have in the city, like the casino funds, the CDBG, CPA, ARPA, to do all we can.

55
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:54,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it's the hardest thing is spending the money because there's so much work that goes into it, but we have such a great team here working hard.

56
00:03:55,121 --> 00:03:58,782
[SPEAKER_02]: I highlighted, you know, our DPW director and our city engineer.

57
00:03:58,842 --> 00:04:01,563
[SPEAKER_02]: We're working on a number of street and sidewalk projects.

58
00:04:01,623 --> 00:04:10,505
[SPEAKER_02]: We're crack sailing the 94 streets that were highlighted in our assessment with decades of backlog where we are doing the planning and not afraid to do the work.

59
00:04:10,605 --> 00:04:11,445
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one of the.

60
00:04:11,685 --> 00:04:22,794
[SPEAKER_02]: biggest complaints we get in the city, the streets and the roads are in deplorable condition and climate change is not helping with that, nor is the fact that we only really spent a million dollars a year on it.

61
00:04:22,994 --> 00:04:28,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Also highlighted some good work going on in the school department, highlighted our

62
00:04:29,538 --> 00:04:33,460
[SPEAKER_02]: need to go electric and hybrid for vehicles.

63
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,982
[SPEAKER_02]: We have three new police cruisers coming in that are going to be hybrid.

64
00:04:37,122 --> 00:04:39,623
[SPEAKER_02]: We also going to work through our parking vehicles.

65
00:04:39,903 --> 00:04:40,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

66
00:04:40,103 --> 00:04:52,869
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I ended my speech too, just with accountability, you know, cause for all the amazing employees we have here, part of my job during the day is changing the culture in Medford and holding people accountable.

67
00:04:53,529 --> 00:04:56,310
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not, that's not easy whatsoever.

68
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,271
[SPEAKER_02]: And people are

69
00:04:58,211 --> 00:05:06,458
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, obviously people that I'm holding accountable aren't happy and that brings some of the picketing type situations you see outside my door.

70
00:05:06,938 --> 00:05:10,100
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's something that I think the residents and the community deserve.

71
00:05:10,261 --> 00:05:13,563
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you want to work here, we would love to have you.

72
00:05:13,723 --> 00:05:15,304
[SPEAKER_02]: And all we want is a

73
00:05:16,045 --> 00:05:21,767
[SPEAKER_02]: good days worth of work and then go home to your families, but you have to come to work, you have to do your job, you have to be professional.

74
00:05:21,847 --> 00:05:34,270
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we're trying to do, professionalize the organization and feel like we've come a really long way and really proud of the team that we're putting together to take care of all of our resident business needs.

75
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:39,341
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some highlights I could probably go on and on, but... I mean, for sure.

76
00:05:39,401 --> 00:05:53,285
[SPEAKER_04]: At high level, a lot of the state of the city to me felt like a conversation of pursuing best practice for the ecosystem that is the city and the kind of growing pains that are necessary in order to get there.

77
00:05:53,365 --> 00:06:03,547
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, everyone will have their own sort of stake in the outcome and the messiness of juggling, keeping everybody a little happy and everybody not happy at the same time.

78
00:06:03,567 --> 00:06:04,067
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

79
00:06:04,128 --> 00:06:05,448
[SPEAKER_04]: That kind of felt like a takeaway for me.

80
00:06:06,148 --> 00:06:07,808
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a hard job.

81
00:06:07,848 --> 00:06:10,149
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's like a lot about a lot of competing interests, too.

82
00:06:10,229 --> 00:06:16,090
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I think, you know, we did we listened on Zoom, so we couldn't hear the honking, but we heard you talking about it.

83
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:18,831
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like, you know, I'm sorry to hear.

84
00:06:18,971 --> 00:06:25,253
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I guess I'm wondering sort of I think, you know, I think the purpose of the state of the city is celebratory.

85
00:06:25,293 --> 00:06:31,074
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like it was a way for you to thank your staff and thank all the people that have been involved in all the hard work.

86
00:06:31,594 --> 00:06:32,135
[SPEAKER_00]: in the last year.

87
00:06:32,335 --> 00:06:42,630
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if you think about kind of hopes for the coming year, sort of like what you see as things that you want to like see some progress in or see some change, kind of what your goals are there.

88
00:06:43,795 --> 00:06:44,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

89
00:06:44,035 --> 00:06:44,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

90
00:06:44,376 --> 00:06:50,941
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that just goes along with some of the highlights too, you know, for three years, we set a lot of goals.

91
00:06:51,002 --> 00:06:59,829
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like we, that was one of the speeches about too, because of the staff, we've been able to meet those goals and we just continue to make new ones and continue to push through.

92
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:07,697
[SPEAKER_02]: So my chief of staff, along with the fire chief, I set out day one to make sure that our fire department personnel have places.

93
00:07:08,317 --> 00:07:14,181
[SPEAKER_02]: to work in that are safe and welcoming and live to the standards that they should.

94
00:07:14,261 --> 00:07:24,548
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've done 20 plus projects, about a million and a half dollars worth of work on things like windows, roofs, kitchens, on all, all of our fire stations.

95
00:07:24,588 --> 00:07:31,673
[SPEAKER_02]: We've also been working very hard on the fire headquarters, which we do have a OPM that has been hired, owners project.

96
00:07:32,113 --> 00:07:42,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Manager, we are working through, we did pick an architect working through a contract and now we'll eventually go out to bond to do most likely, I think they're going to recommend a brand new station.

97
00:07:42,415 --> 00:07:45,395
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, people are saying we're stalling.

98
00:07:45,435 --> 00:07:46,336
[SPEAKER_02]: We are not stalling.

99
00:07:46,396 --> 00:07:53,377
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a ton of work and we are actively working through getting that contract signed so we can move forward.

100
00:07:53,457 --> 00:07:58,138
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're hoping to see breaking ground in the next, you know, year, year and a half.

101
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:01,159
[SPEAKER_02]: and getting that project through the finish line.

102
00:08:01,619 --> 00:08:07,061
[SPEAKER_02]: And that my chief of staff started with that role when she came in as special project manager.

103
00:08:07,101 --> 00:08:10,582
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fire stations and then she was working with our procurement department.

104
00:08:10,643 --> 00:08:14,244
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something that we're very proud of that we're working on and we're going to continue to work on.

105
00:08:14,624 --> 00:08:18,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we also have, you know, our parks were kind of, they were neglected as well.

106
00:08:18,866 --> 00:08:25,228
[SPEAKER_02]: We would have like every five years prior administrations did a great job making sure to redo like one park at a time.

107
00:08:25,428 --> 00:08:26,289
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just thought.

108
00:08:27,349 --> 00:08:32,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Coming in knowing there wasn't CDBG money from 2014 and on that just wasn't spent.

109
00:08:32,632 --> 00:08:49,603
[SPEAKER_02]: We had an opportunity there and the personnel we have in place now, I set out, we set a committee, we put a committee together of internal staff to make plans, figure out what needed to be done, to create surveys, gain public input.

110
00:08:49,923 --> 00:08:52,464
[SPEAKER_02]: have open public meetings, and we've been able to do that.

111
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:55,926
[SPEAKER_02]: So once a month we meet and we have a list of 100 projects.

112
00:08:56,387 --> 00:09:02,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Some are complete, like the new tennis courts at Duggar Park, new basketball courts at Playstead and Barry Park.

113
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:07,813
[SPEAKER_02]: We are going to break ground on Morrison Park this spring, summer.

114
00:09:08,653 --> 00:09:11,834
[SPEAKER_02]: That's over a $400,000 project for a new play structure.

115
00:09:11,854 --> 00:09:16,035
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to break ground on Gillis Park, which is an over a million dollar project.

116
00:09:17,155 --> 00:09:19,116
[SPEAKER_02]: That started because it's inaccessible.

117
00:09:19,216 --> 00:09:29,699
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to make sure that that park's accessible to all, but it's turned into a project where there'll be, you know, new baseball field and accessible entrances, as well as, you know, exercise equipment.

118
00:09:30,179 --> 00:09:34,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we're going to be breaking ground on Carr Park, which is a multimillion dollar project.

119
00:09:34,384 --> 00:09:35,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Super excited about it.

120
00:09:35,525 --> 00:09:38,829
[SPEAKER_02]: That's been our baby for a year and a half now.

121
00:09:38,909 --> 00:09:42,773
[SPEAKER_02]: We've gained great community feedback, so we're very excited about that.

122
00:09:43,254 --> 00:09:48,740
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have a list of 50 other projects, smaller in size, that we're working on.

123
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,600
[SPEAKER_02]: to get all that work done.

124
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:53,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Takes a team effort, a lot of hard work.

125
00:09:53,081 --> 00:09:58,282
[SPEAKER_02]: So exciting to see all that, you know, all the planning come to fruition.

126
00:09:58,302 --> 00:10:03,363
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll start seeing a lot of groundbreakings and ribbon cuttings and continue on with that path.

127
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:03,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

128
00:10:03,983 --> 00:10:04,203
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

129
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:05,843
[SPEAKER_00]: Carr Park is our local park.

130
00:10:05,863 --> 00:10:08,504
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm excited to come find you.

131
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:08,784
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

132
00:10:08,864 --> 00:10:14,745
[SPEAKER_00]: So I also I also heard the McGlynn Playgrounds getting a whole new revamp.

133
00:10:14,805 --> 00:10:15,245
[SPEAKER_00]: Exciting.

134
00:10:15,765 --> 00:10:17,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Glenn Playground is exciting too.

135
00:10:17,487 --> 00:10:22,533
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a great committee working hard to gain the funding and helping on the funding end.

136
00:10:22,613 --> 00:10:25,075
[SPEAKER_02]: And Dr. Cushing's been really great leading that charge.

137
00:10:25,115 --> 00:10:26,437
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're very excited.

138
00:10:26,477 --> 00:10:30,501
[SPEAKER_02]: It's long overdue, especially with the flooding that is going on over in that area.

139
00:10:30,561 --> 00:10:35,347
[SPEAKER_02]: So drainage comes first and then new park for all of our kids and the whole community.

140
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:36,328
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

141
00:10:36,953 --> 00:10:44,384
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I wonder, too, if this is a good way to transition to talking about the schools and some of the stuff, you know, you know, obviously happening in the high school.

142
00:10:44,465 --> 00:10:51,996
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think something that you've talked about for a while is the state of the high school and sort of future plans for how to address that.

143
00:10:52,677 --> 00:10:55,658
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wonder about how that maybe connects to some of the budget stuff.

144
00:10:55,678 --> 00:11:09,522
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've talked about ARPA being a temporary fund, sort of what you're hoping for as we emerge from COVID and different ideas of what revenue will look like or how you'll think about funding for some of those big things.

145
00:11:10,214 --> 00:11:10,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

146
00:11:10,494 --> 00:11:10,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

147
00:11:10,955 --> 00:11:16,560
[SPEAKER_02]: We, before we recorded, we were talking about Mr. Murphy and he is actually staying on with the city.

148
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:25,868
[SPEAKER_02]: He had a big part along with our superintendent to make sure that we did the proper studies to be able to put forth the best application we could to the MSBA.

149
00:11:26,509 --> 00:11:28,190
[SPEAKER_02]: So we submitted that last year.

150
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:31,832
[SPEAKER_02]: And we did the walkthrough, which I was present for.

151
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:35,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Last year, they funded 17 new high schools.

152
00:11:36,114 --> 00:11:42,077
[SPEAKER_02]: This year, they funded 10 and we fell between the 10 and 14 mark, unfortunately.

153
00:11:42,457 --> 00:11:46,699
[SPEAKER_02]: But the good news, which we're super excited about, is that we are getting ready.

154
00:11:46,719 --> 00:11:48,380
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to submit again, which is

155
00:11:48,737 --> 00:11:54,222
[SPEAKER_02]: The application's due in April and fingers crossed, it sounds like we have a really good opportunity here.

156
00:11:54,622 --> 00:12:09,134
[SPEAKER_02]: So once we hopefully get good news in the fall, then we will start the public campaign, put a committee together to help with the process and start a public campaign because we're gonna need a debt exclusion to be able to fund a new high school.

157
00:12:10,492 --> 00:12:14,034
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Attleboro High School is in the 300 million range.

158
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:18,256
[SPEAKER_02]: So the taxpayers did vote for debt exclusion to help fund that.

159
00:12:18,296 --> 00:12:22,578
[SPEAKER_02]: And I truly feel that Medford residents are ready and able and willing to.

160
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:24,139
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time.

161
00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:26,880
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time for our first debt exclusion that I'm aware of.

162
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:31,763
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's something I'll be actively, actively pushing for because our students deserve a

163
00:12:32,243 --> 00:12:35,184
[SPEAKER_02]: flagship school that they can be proud of, they feel safe in.

164
00:12:35,364 --> 00:12:39,186
[SPEAKER_02]: It has proper air conditioning and heat and we're struggling there.

165
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:46,949
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we've spent some ARPA dollars on different projects and there's ESSER funding that we've been using, but that high school needs a remit and it needs it as soon as possible.

166
00:12:47,069 --> 00:12:52,952
[SPEAKER_02]: So fingers crossed and we're going to keep doing whatever we can to make that come, become a reality.

167
00:12:53,432 --> 00:12:54,892
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you say what a debt exclusion is?

168
00:12:54,932 --> 00:12:56,173
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure I've heard that term before.

169
00:12:57,373 --> 00:13:00,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, a debt exclusion is something that the taxpayers will have to vote on.

170
00:13:00,774 --> 00:13:08,537
[SPEAKER_02]: It will have to pass by more than 50% of the voters and a debt exclusion will drop once the project's paid for.

171
00:13:09,057 --> 00:13:15,859
[SPEAKER_02]: So an override is something that would last in for eternity, but a debt exclusion would, would drop off.

172
00:13:15,939 --> 00:13:21,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Taxpayers, property taxpayers would pay a certain amount per year until that project was complete.

173
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:27,724
[SPEAKER_00]: So a temporary raise in maybe not taxes, but temporary raise in what we would.

174
00:13:27,744 --> 00:13:31,066
[SPEAKER_02]: Temporary raise in taxes, but that would fall once the project's paid for.

175
00:13:31,752 --> 00:13:32,172
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.

176
00:13:32,372 --> 00:13:38,976
[SPEAKER_02]: So your FUSO tax base we're voting for, do you agree with a debt exclusion to build a new high school?

177
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:46,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we are an override, which we are, you know, kind of gathering the data for and doing forecasting, budgetary forecasting.

178
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:53,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if we did a three, five, six million dollar override, that would be every year, forever.

179
00:13:53,764 --> 00:13:55,065
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd get that additional funding.

180
00:13:56,565 --> 00:13:56,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

181
00:13:56,926 --> 00:13:58,947
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't, I didn't hold that difference.

182
00:13:59,067 --> 00:13:59,547
[SPEAKER_04]: You didn't know that?

183
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:00,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

184
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:08,758
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's discussion, you know, between the council and myself, there has been on the need for an override and we know we need a new high school.

185
00:14:08,838 --> 00:14:16,945
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's just a delicate topic that I just really want to make, I want to make that decision myself through the data.

186
00:14:17,026 --> 00:14:17,966
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what we're doing now.

187
00:14:18,026 --> 00:14:22,451
[SPEAKER_02]: We're, we're forecasting, we are getting ready to figure out what is needed and

188
00:14:23,011 --> 00:14:25,273
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't do anything to jeopardize a new high school.

189
00:14:25,414 --> 00:14:29,418
[SPEAKER_02]: And now everybody knows it's just with inflation, it's tough.

190
00:14:29,538 --> 00:14:35,064
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I get people who want an old ride and then the next email will be, I can't afford to heat my house.

191
00:14:35,564 --> 00:14:41,431
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a delicate balance, people's ability to pay and the need of the city.

192
00:14:41,971 --> 00:14:51,737
[SPEAKER_02]: So I see the need, you know, I see the five to 10 positions we put in place with our ARPA dollars and how that has helped us move the city forward.

193
00:14:51,797 --> 00:14:58,381
[SPEAKER_02]: So I see both sides and I want to just make the best decision for our taxpayers, for the city that I can make.

194
00:14:58,461 --> 00:15:04,784
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's just something we are exploring and trying to figure out what the right answer is.

195
00:15:06,052 --> 00:15:13,798
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a little time because our, the revenue replacement funding that we can use through ARPA, we have that for another two budgets.

196
00:15:14,098 --> 00:15:21,003
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we didn't override right now, the override money would come in and it would just reduce what we'd be able to use for revenue replacement.

197
00:15:21,223 --> 00:15:28,869
[SPEAKER_02]: So it makes, it does make sense to, if we do need an override to, to make sure that, that, that kicks in once ARPA dollars fall.

198
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:33,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Doing it now might hamper what we could even use for revenue replacement.

199
00:15:33,754 --> 00:15:34,095
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

200
00:15:35,218 --> 00:15:38,766
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also heard to talk about like different development happening around the city.

201
00:15:38,807 --> 00:15:42,997
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there, are there other sources of revenue that you're hoping will kind of start to show up?

202
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:49,711
[SPEAKER_02]: The main one we're working on and counting on is our new growth.

203
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:56,773
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what hopefully will kick in, not this fiscal budget that will start July 1, fiscal year 24.

204
00:15:57,273 --> 00:16:06,096
[SPEAKER_02]: By fiscal year 25 is when I'm expecting to see, we'll see some in 24, but I'm expecting to see a whole lot of new growth in fiscal year 25.

205
00:16:06,196 --> 00:16:10,637
[SPEAKER_02]: And fingers crossed, like some projects may stall a bit because of the economy, but

206
00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:23,242
[SPEAKER_02]: We are working on the acres and acres of land above the Wellington Tee parking lot, which can be a multi, you know, million dollar project, great for our community.

207
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:32,966
[SPEAKER_02]: Tee-centered, you know, that create multi-use for hopefully housing and commercial and life science and restaurants.

208
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:35,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we also have the Forty Beans developer who

209
00:16:36,147 --> 00:16:43,950
[SPEAKER_02]: changed his scope a bit and we have a billion dollar project proposed for Mystic Ave with commercial on the bottom floor and life science buildings.

210
00:16:44,470 --> 00:17:00,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we're also working on our two other 40Bs which will be one we've negotiated with and they've already gone back to the ZBA that will add an additional I believe 350 units, 25% of which will be affordable and that's on Mystic Valley Parkway, somewhat behind Wegmans.

211
00:17:00,656 --> 00:17:02,617
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also have one on the Fellsway and we have our

212
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:09,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Four negotiated community host agreements, three with retail marijuana sales, one with a cultivation.

213
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:10,924
[SPEAKER_02]: He's already broke ground.

214
00:17:10,964 --> 00:17:11,985
[SPEAKER_02]: They're on Mystic Ave.

215
00:17:12,165 --> 00:17:15,348
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'll, you'll see the art center hopefully in the next year.

216
00:17:16,409 --> 00:17:18,531
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you have one on Riverside Ave.

217
00:17:19,051 --> 00:17:23,195
[SPEAKER_02]: You also have big developments across from where Sanctuary will go on Riverside Ave.

218
00:17:23,215 --> 00:17:24,976
[SPEAKER_02]: That's 400 under Riverside Ave.

219
00:17:24,996 --> 00:17:28,780
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be a potential research and development location along with

220
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,801
[SPEAKER_02]: 15 Sycamore, which will also be research and development.

221
00:17:32,941 --> 00:17:38,063
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just to name maybe five, six, seven projects out of the 30 that we're working on.

222
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:39,824
[SPEAKER_02]: But Medford Square is a big one.

223
00:17:39,864 --> 00:17:49,387
[SPEAKER_02]: We have MAPC working with us doing a community-driven, a final community-driven approach to hopefully get an RFP out on one, two, or three of those lots.

224
00:17:49,847 --> 00:17:52,870
[SPEAKER_02]: My, it's sometime in 2023, the sooner, the better.

225
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:57,233
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also working with a consultant to work on the waterfront.

226
00:17:57,633 --> 00:17:57,874
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

227
00:17:58,114 --> 00:18:02,477
[SPEAKER_02]: In Bedford Square, all the way down to Sleepy Hollow, which will be more recreational.

228
00:18:02,497 --> 00:18:11,845
[SPEAKER_02]: I see like water art and a dog and maybe a location for our seniors to go and residence during the day, a place where we could have a beer garden.

229
00:18:11,885 --> 00:18:16,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I see the doors swinging open to like a natural play area and kids could be there too.

230
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:17,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice wall.

231
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:24,954
[SPEAKER_02]: with art, beautiful art on it, and then go down to Sleepy Hollow through from the walkway and potentially a dog park.

232
00:18:25,535 --> 00:18:26,315
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.

233
00:18:26,876 --> 00:18:27,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

234
00:18:28,056 --> 00:18:28,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

235
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:36,882
[SPEAKER_02]: So those designs, those designs, that's my vision, but obviously they're designing that now through meetings we've had, and then we'll put that out to the public to get input.

236
00:18:38,303 --> 00:18:38,463
[SPEAKER_02]: But.

237
00:18:39,717 --> 00:18:40,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

238
00:18:40,518 --> 00:18:40,938
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

239
00:18:41,018 --> 00:18:58,791
[SPEAKER_00]: The one other budget thing I remember hearing about over the summer was sort of the, we, you know, we, like you mentioned a little bit about the teacher contracts, but I wonder if there's like, so when you go to renew their contracts in several years, will there be like, how are you thinking about like the sort of continued increase in that budget?

240
00:18:58,991 --> 00:18:59,631
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as?

241
00:19:00,752 --> 00:19:04,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we settled the contract and that, that's what I did do.

242
00:19:04,534 --> 00:19:06,134
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I mentioned it a bit ago.

243
00:19:06,154 --> 00:19:22,181
[SPEAKER_02]: We, I offered, we offered the 3% to add an additional year to the contract, like I said, to help settle things down and to get them that, you know, good 3%, which is when I feel we'll have the new growth to be able to, to afford that.

244
00:19:22,201 --> 00:19:22,841
[SPEAKER_02]: We had.

245
00:19:24,502 --> 00:19:27,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the retro came out of the fiscal year 22 budget.

246
00:19:27,605 --> 00:19:28,966
[SPEAKER_02]: Some will come out of this budget.

247
00:19:29,107 --> 00:19:48,185
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a balancing act now because we have another number of units that we're negotiating with and they want the same as what the teachers got, which is something that I'm trying to work with finance on to see what we have the ability to afford because we want to do

248
00:19:48,685 --> 00:19:52,268
[SPEAKER_02]: what's best for our employees and be as fair as we possibly can.

249
00:19:52,328 --> 00:19:55,010
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, we have budget restraints.

250
00:19:55,991 --> 00:20:00,274
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had a tough budget gap last year and we're going to have another tough one.

251
00:20:00,294 --> 00:20:02,736
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, fiscal year 24 is not going to be any easier.

252
00:20:02,957 --> 00:20:06,139
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why you're going to it's another reason you'll see the pickets out there, too.

253
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:12,905
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to do what's best for our employees while trying to make sure we can afford it and that we're not

254
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:17,828
[SPEAKER_02]: cutting other services to be able to afford it that our taxpayers deserve.

255
00:20:18,148 --> 00:20:20,890
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where the forecasting and the budgeting has come into play.

256
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:24,752
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are well in advance of where we were last year with the budget.

257
00:20:24,812 --> 00:20:26,253
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, we're working on that now.

258
00:20:26,313 --> 00:20:28,374
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a great CFO who came on board.

259
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:29,495
[SPEAKER_02]: We were out one for.

260
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:33,896
[SPEAKER_02]: 11 months, we have a great budget, new budget director that came on board.

261
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:35,717
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's some of the city struggles.

262
00:20:36,077 --> 00:20:41,018
[SPEAKER_02]: There's lack of finance personnel that people are just not going into government.

263
00:20:41,438 --> 00:20:49,861
[SPEAKER_02]: So the state is actually working on an, like an apprenticeship program for assessors because there's a lack of assessors out there.

264
00:20:50,521 --> 00:21:05,745
[SPEAKER_02]: And through DLS, we're able to request that one of these apprentices, once they're trained, that they come to our community and help work in the department, gain the training so that we have more assessors in the field overall, and that's paid for by the state.

265
00:21:06,086 --> 00:21:08,466
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's how tough it is to find an assessor.

266
00:21:08,966 --> 00:21:14,428
[SPEAKER_02]: And then city solicitor, same boat like Somerville has, is looking for four or more.

267
00:21:14,968 --> 00:21:19,331
[SPEAKER_02]: We are having a tough time hiring anybody with any experience as a city solicitor.

268
00:21:19,632 --> 00:21:29,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Thankfully we have outside labor, outside counsel that has been great and really helped move this city forward, but we're just struggling in a few areas where I know other communities are too.

269
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:30,760
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

270
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:31,060
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

271
00:21:32,189 --> 00:21:35,112
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, maybe talk to me about Tufts.

272
00:21:35,152 --> 00:21:47,647
[SPEAKER_04]: So I am 100% unaware of the details of any of this conversation, but I also often find myself wondering about the relationship between Tufts University and the city of Medford and what that means for just

273
00:21:48,868 --> 00:21:50,889
[SPEAKER_04]: space and property and taxes.

274
00:21:51,129 --> 00:21:56,252
[SPEAKER_04]: And in addition, what it means for our families to feel sort of served by their programming.

275
00:21:56,332 --> 00:22:05,977
[SPEAKER_04]: And then later on, as kids get older, for our kids to feel like they belong on a college campus and that college belongs to their future, if, should they want it and et cetera, et cetera.

276
00:22:06,037 --> 00:22:07,418
[SPEAKER_04]: It sort of tethers into the high school.

277
00:22:07,478 --> 00:22:10,940
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have the scientifically, educationally, digitally advanced high school.

278
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,381
[SPEAKER_04]: What does that mean for who gets pulled into the city?

279
00:22:13,401 --> 00:22:17,083
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, all the, they're, they're all combined, but I wondered if you had thoughts.

280
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:27,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Tufts increased their pilot payment to the city in 2019 or 2020 to, it was around the 200,000 mark and they had been very, they've been great always providing that now $450,000 check to the city.

281
00:22:27,158 --> 00:22:28,119
[SPEAKER_02]: So they pay that annually.

282
00:22:36,565 --> 00:22:40,446
[SPEAKER_02]: They were amazing, amazing to us through COVID.

283
00:22:40,766 --> 00:22:45,707
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they were the ones that helped us set up the, all that you saw in the schools with the testing.

284
00:22:45,787 --> 00:22:47,868
[SPEAKER_02]: So like for that, I'm forever thankful.

285
00:22:48,028 --> 00:22:58,691
[SPEAKER_02]: They're pretty good about telling us ahead of time with any development details and they will work with us and have community meetings that they're doing it for a few homes they're redeveloping now.

286
00:22:58,771 --> 00:23:03,492
[SPEAKER_02]: They also just had a community meeting dormitory they're proposing on Boston Ave.

287
00:23:03,512 --> 00:23:03,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

288
00:23:05,832 --> 00:23:10,055
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, we, you know, we have a really good relationship.

289
00:23:10,115 --> 00:23:14,577
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that more needs to probably be done with a full pilot.

290
00:23:14,658 --> 00:23:23,083
[SPEAKER_02]: We just, that's one thing that I worked with the committee on to try to try to get that organized and it's kind of on my to-do list.

291
00:23:23,863 --> 00:23:28,265
[SPEAKER_02]: But they, they don't have written pilots with Boston.

292
00:23:28,285 --> 00:23:30,827
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, I don't, I'm not sure if they have one with Somerville.

293
00:23:30,847 --> 00:23:36,289
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's one of those things where you could have a full agreement or you can just get there yearly.

294
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:43,373
[SPEAKER_02]: They do almost a magazine where they show all the community benefits that they provide, tutoring, community day.

295
00:23:43,733 --> 00:23:48,776
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know they're doing, they're doing what they've always done at least, but always willing to.

296
00:23:49,336 --> 00:23:55,404
[SPEAKER_02]: hear from the community members on what else you want to see from Tufts, because I do always propose different ideas to them and ask them for help.

297
00:23:55,865 --> 00:24:05,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we had a pre-meeting for, after everything that happened in Martha's Vineyard, we had a pre-meeting in Medford, you know, internally in Medford, you know, let's get ready in case this happens in Medford.

298
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:12,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Right away when I asked Tufts, I'm like, Tufts, would you be able to house, if this happened to us, would you be able to help us?

299
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:13,584
[SPEAKER_02]: And they said, absolutely.

300
00:24:13,604 --> 00:24:16,526
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a dorm that's not being utilized.

301
00:24:16,847 --> 00:24:20,789
[SPEAKER_02]: We are in, we are here to help you here in Somerville if this ever does happen.

302
00:24:20,849 --> 00:24:26,193
[SPEAKER_02]: So sometimes they say no to certain things, but they really have been a great, great partner to work with.

303
00:24:27,014 --> 00:24:29,476
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to see a resident, a membership to their gym.

304
00:24:31,097 --> 00:24:33,519
[SPEAKER_02]: They do for, they do for the local.

305
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:39,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they do for the surrounding neighborhood, but I don't, it's not something that's available to every resident.

306
00:24:39,524 --> 00:24:39,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

307
00:24:39,664 --> 00:24:41,406
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I have to move, I guess.

308
00:24:41,786 --> 00:24:42,527
[SPEAKER_00]: Move closer.

309
00:24:42,987 --> 00:24:43,768
[SPEAKER_00]: No, don't leave us.

310
00:24:43,868 --> 00:24:46,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't leave us in the heights, Danielle.

311
00:24:47,011 --> 00:24:48,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Bigger car park coming.

312
00:24:48,352 --> 00:24:48,932
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know.

313
00:24:49,012 --> 00:24:49,373
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited.

314
00:24:50,013 --> 00:24:50,193
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.

315
00:24:50,233 --> 00:24:52,836
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, anything else that you want to make sure to mention before we wrap up?

316
00:24:54,457 --> 00:24:57,480
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think, you know, there's,

317
00:24:59,293 --> 00:25:02,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Doing this job is tough, you know, and never can make everybody happy.

318
00:25:02,778 --> 00:25:08,967
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know there's narratives out there on a number of things and some things I can't talk about if it's like personnel related.

319
00:25:09,488 --> 00:25:14,315
[SPEAKER_02]: So that part's hard because the narrative is one-sided and I can't give my...

320
00:25:15,617 --> 00:25:16,438
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, take on it.

321
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:20,121
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think I said it in my speech, you know, there's certain things that I just won't tolerate.

322
00:25:20,301 --> 00:25:22,744
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I won't tolerate racism.

323
00:25:22,804 --> 00:25:24,926
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't tolerate abuse.

324
00:25:25,526 --> 00:25:29,310
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't tolerate, you know, just there's things I won't tolerate.

325
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:31,411
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I do, I do hold people accountable.

326
00:25:31,451 --> 00:25:33,794
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's what the community deserves.

327
00:25:33,874 --> 00:25:35,035
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes I can't

328
00:25:35,855 --> 00:25:42,578
[SPEAKER_02]: explain my side, which is tough, but like I said on Wednesday, just please trust me.

329
00:25:42,618 --> 00:25:52,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if we're doing things for reasons, we're always checking with counsel before we do things and we're trying to do what's best on every issue we deal with.

330
00:25:52,363 --> 00:26:04,769
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's just something, you know, it's hard to not be able to give your side on things, but I really appreciate the time here today to, you know, let you know some of the great things going on in Medford and highlight the speech and

331
00:26:05,169 --> 00:26:12,174
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad we've settled with the teachers and things seem to be going very well in the school and our kids are very important to us, so.

332
00:26:13,074 --> 00:26:13,434
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

333
00:26:13,454 --> 00:26:21,720
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we actually I didn't mention it yet, but it seemed intentional and we really appreciated seeing the presence of three women, three of our like female city officials.

334
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:24,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I texted Daniel, I go, are you seeing this?

335
00:26:24,361 --> 00:26:27,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you realize that all women and mothers are running this tonight?

336
00:26:27,743 --> 00:26:28,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's why I asked.

337
00:26:28,564 --> 00:26:29,385
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of the reasons.

338
00:26:30,265 --> 00:26:32,526
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of the reasons why I asked them, like, this would be great.

339
00:26:32,606 --> 00:26:34,286
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a president.

340
00:26:34,506 --> 00:26:36,807
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, you know, female of the council.

341
00:26:36,827 --> 00:26:39,107
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the vice chair is female.

342
00:26:39,167 --> 00:26:40,768
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, I'm like, I think it would be great.

343
00:26:40,828 --> 00:26:44,849
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I asked them and they were like, yes, right away, I was like, this is going to be awesome.

344
00:26:45,369 --> 00:26:49,110
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Terry, Terry started us off with a beautiful, beautiful poem.

345
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:50,550
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's always, he's amazing.

346
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:52,671
[SPEAKER_02]: He's our poet laureate through the fiscal year.

347
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:54,871
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll be doing the application process.

348
00:26:55,031 --> 00:26:56,011
[SPEAKER_02]: He had a two-year term.

349
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,932
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be doing the application process for.

350

[SPEAKER_02]: him to pass the torch July 1.

351

[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of great things.

352
00:27:02,493 --> 00:27:02,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

353
00:27:02,833 --> 00:27:13,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Working on a beautiful mural, art mural at Wright's Pond that will be painted in June and hopefully during the season opening so the kids will be able to watch it get painted.

354
00:27:13,955 --> 00:27:14,916
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of great things.

355
00:27:14,936 --> 00:27:15,916
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of great things.

356
00:27:16,396 --> 00:27:16,716
