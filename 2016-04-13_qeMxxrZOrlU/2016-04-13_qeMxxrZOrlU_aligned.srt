1
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:18,551
Mayor, thank you so much for hosting April as Donate Life Month in this beautiful city.

2
00:00:18,571 --> 00:00:25,713
It's an opportunity to encourage everyone to think about, learn more, and register as an organ and tissue donor.

3
00:00:25,773 --> 00:00:41,776
We are the New England Organ Bank, a federally designated OPO organ procurement organization responsible for educating the New England region about organ and tissue donation and being the mechanism to identify and to get organs from one place to the other to truly help save lives.

4
00:00:41,997 --> 00:00:43,217
Organ donation is about life.

5
00:00:44,517 --> 00:00:47,079
We don't want anyone to pass away.

6
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:52,643
That being said, sadly, people do pass away, and there's an opportunity to help save an individual's lives.

7
00:00:53,163 --> 00:01:05,190
The state plays a very important role in the organ donation process, as 99.6% of all people who do identify themselves as organ and tissue donors and register do so at the RMV.

8
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:07,072
So we're here to thank the RMV as well.

9
00:01:07,092 --> 00:01:09,533
It's a good example.

10
00:01:10,054 --> 00:01:13,536
It also shows that Massachusetts and there, you specifically, have a heart.

11
00:01:14,036 --> 00:01:18,057
that if you no longer need your organ, someone else can truly benefit from them.

12
00:01:18,077 --> 00:01:21,338
And we're here today to really celebrate those wonderful stories.

13
00:01:21,418 --> 00:01:23,238
We've got wonderful volunteers to do so.

14
00:01:23,258 --> 00:01:26,259
And we're going to start with Mike Beal, who's going to share his story.

15
00:01:26,279 --> 00:01:26,459
Mike.

16
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,260
Bill, excuse me.

17
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:28,600
Sorry.

18
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:29,400
I've got somebody.

19
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,220
Mike's over there.

20
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:30,920
Bill's right here.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,841
Sorry, Bill.

22
00:01:31,881 --> 00:01:32,321
Good morning.

23
00:01:32,581 --> 00:01:33,921
Good morning, Bill.

24
00:01:34,681 --> 00:01:40,703
Two years, five months, 22 days ago, an amazing young man passed away.

25
00:01:41,861 --> 00:01:46,602
But in death, he gave me the greatest gift that one person can pass to another.

26
00:01:47,163 --> 00:01:48,043
He was an organ donor.

27
00:01:48,763 --> 00:01:52,624
He checked that box when he went to the registry.

28
00:01:52,644 --> 00:01:58,626
I went from being able to stay awake maybe eight hours a day, three days a week.

29
00:01:58,706 --> 00:02:00,947
I spent four hours hooked up on a machine.

30
00:02:01,007 --> 00:02:04,068
Some days I could barely make it home because it was so exhausting.

31
00:02:05,121 --> 00:02:11,507
made a couple of trips to the emergency room because the dialysis pump was doing one thing and my heart was trying to do another.

32
00:02:11,527 --> 00:02:13,249
They didn't get along too well.

33
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:17,413
Now, I'm up early in the morning.

34
00:02:18,073 --> 00:02:20,756
Don't want to go to bed at night and figure that I'm going to miss something.

35
00:02:22,317 --> 00:02:27,282
And I'm enjoying my granddaughter, my two boys, my daughter.

36
00:02:28,463 --> 00:02:29,084
Life is grand.

37
00:02:30,001 --> 00:02:33,923
And it's all because this one person made that life-changing decision.

38
00:02:34,784 --> 00:02:37,305
So thank you, please check the box.

39
00:02:38,326 --> 00:02:40,668
What a wonderful story.

40
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:41,248
Thank you.

41
00:02:41,268 --> 00:02:43,549
Thank you.

42
00:02:43,629 --> 00:02:47,211
Bill's here for a reason, because it is a miraculous story.

43
00:02:47,372 --> 00:02:51,654
And that individual checked yes at the RMV, so thank you so much for sharing that.

44
00:02:52,194 --> 00:02:54,936
Organ and tissue donation is a voluntary choice.

45
00:02:54,996 --> 00:02:57,678
People can say yes, or people don't have to register.

46
00:02:57,718 --> 00:02:59,539
That being said, it's not a neutral choice.

47
00:03:00,057 --> 00:03:08,483
both the state and federal government strongly support organ donation and provide the easiest mechanism to register, and that is at the RMV here in Massachusetts.

48
00:03:08,979 --> 00:03:11,541
or the DMV in every 15 states.

49
00:03:12,341 --> 00:03:21,366
We stand uniquely apart from all other kind of medical issues in that importance of cancer research, AIDS research.

50
00:03:21,786 --> 00:03:23,207
We are different in two ways.

51
00:03:23,227 --> 00:03:24,608
A, we know what the cure is.

52
00:03:24,648 --> 00:03:29,951
We're not looking for a cure, and that is the opportunity to help save someone else's life through the wonderful transplantation.

53
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:34,308
And second of all, when we talk about donation, we're not talking about a financial contribution.

54
00:03:34,648 --> 00:03:40,173
We're talking about the opportunity to register as an altruistic person who can donate.

55
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:44,574
Again, we have wonderful stories about organ and tissue donation and there are two sides to that.

56
00:03:44,674 --> 00:03:53,116
A, the people who are alive today because of that, and B, the loved ones who are honoring their loved ones who became true heroes by registering and donating.

57
00:03:53,496 --> 00:03:55,356
Carol, thank you so much for sharing your story with us.

58
00:03:55,396 --> 00:03:55,977
My pleasure.

59
00:03:56,437 --> 00:03:58,617
Good morning.

60
00:03:58,657 --> 00:04:01,418
I'm going to begin and ask you to hold this for me.

61
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:02,138
This is Ethan.

62
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:11,304
And it was in April of 1999, Ethan was a beautiful 11-month-old little boy and our youngest grandson.

63
00:04:12,104 --> 00:04:27,773
While Ethan, his mom, dad, 3-year-old brother, my husband, and I were on a wonderful California vacation adventure, our lives changed forever in a split second of time when a limb of a giant redwood tree fell and hit him in the head.

64
00:04:29,405 --> 00:04:35,572
Med flight flew Ethan to Stanford University, where he received the most wonderful and compassionate care.

65
00:04:36,393 --> 00:04:44,501
And we continually prayed for a miracle, that he would be the same beautiful, loving little boy he was when he had woken up that Saturday morning.

66
00:04:45,751 --> 00:04:58,898
However, after three days, the pediatric neurosurgeon explained to us, his nana and grampy, that Ethan was about to be declared brain dead, and that his mom and dad had decided to donate his organs.

67
00:05:00,038 --> 00:05:02,600
I can't really explain to you our emotions.

68
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,200
There were so many.

69
00:05:04,961 --> 00:05:05,761
We were crushed.

70
00:05:06,722 --> 00:05:12,605
And yet as parents, we were so proud of the wonderful decision made by these two heartbroken kids.

71
00:05:13,845 --> 00:05:18,227
And again we prayed, but this time we prayed that a donor or donors would be found.

72
00:05:18,867 --> 00:05:22,949
And in our pain, suddenly there was a feeling of peace.

73
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:33,614
Later we were told that Ethan's liver would be going to a little boy the same age from the northwest, and his two kidneys would travel east to a 55 year old man.

74
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:41,177
And immediately it felt as if the sun came out with a beautiful rainbow in the middle of a terrible storm.

75
00:05:42,782 --> 00:05:46,365
Finally, something wonderful was gonna come out of the tragedy we were living.

76
00:05:47,606 --> 00:05:50,548
And then we brought Ethan home and he was buried next to my mom.

77
00:05:51,749 --> 00:06:09,442
And it was sometime in the year that followed during my grief when I realized that that same Easter weekend that we were praying for Ethan to live, the families of his recipients were praying just as fervently for their loved ones to live, and Ethan was the answer to their prayers.

78
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:15,253
And I realized how blessed were we to have him, even though it was such a short time.

79
00:06:16,154 --> 00:06:25,460
So I share this story in the hopes that if I can influence just one person on the importance and the rewards of organ donation, then his legacy lives on.

80
00:06:26,601 --> 00:06:30,503
It was 17 years ago, but sometimes it seems just like yesterday.

81
00:06:31,244 --> 00:06:37,608
And through his story, Ethan has touched more people than I will ever touch in my lifetime.

82
00:06:38,327 --> 00:06:42,348
So in honor of Ethan, I ask that everyone consider being an organ donor.

83
00:06:42,609 --> 00:06:45,129
And if you have already, please spread the word.

84
00:06:45,149 --> 00:06:46,190
Thank you.

85
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:47,650
Thank you.

86
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,313
That is an amazing story.

87
00:06:54,793 --> 00:07:06,097
And in such a time of trouble, for parents to be able to dig so deep to come through with this organ donation is just an amazing background story on behalf of families that received the transplants.

88
00:07:07,278 --> 00:07:09,940
And Mayor, thank you for giving an opportunity to share these powerful stories.

89
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:20,287
That is what we're here to do, for people to learn more about organ and tissue donation, and when they go to their RMV every five years to consider checking that yes box to truly help save an individual's lives.

90
00:07:20,347 --> 00:07:26,010
Over the past three years, we've worked very closely with the RMV, and those registration rates have increased dramatically.

91
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:29,873
Now over 50% of people who come to the RMV say yes, and it's because of these

92
00:07:30,282 --> 00:07:33,807
miraculous stories, and the power and miracle of transplantation.

93
00:07:34,268 --> 00:07:36,852
We have Nico, who's also here to share his wonderful story.

94
00:07:36,872 --> 00:07:39,836
Nico is one of our newer volunteers, and thank you so much for sharing.

95
00:07:39,856 --> 00:07:40,457
I appreciate it.

96
00:07:42,238 --> 00:07:45,380
My father passed away in 2013, and he was a traditional pre-Protodox.

97
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,521
Traditionally, they are supposed to donate their organs, but since then, the church has

98
00:08:03,164 --> 00:08:09,508
But growing up here, we were always told to not own it.

99
00:08:09,868 --> 00:08:16,412
So then when Pamela and I found out the reason why we shut it off,

100
00:08:18,292 --> 00:08:21,154
He said, well, I'll be gone, so I don't even need him.

101
00:08:21,174 --> 00:08:23,515
And I had to save the kid.

102
00:08:23,996 --> 00:08:26,337
His eye ended up saving a pastor.

103
00:08:27,098 --> 00:08:32,361
And he also donated his liver and two kidneys.

104
00:08:32,941 --> 00:08:34,302
He saved three more lives.

105
00:08:34,943 --> 00:08:40,566
And also donated his skin tissue, bone tissue, and his eyes.

106
00:08:40,606 --> 00:08:44,268
So it increased quality of life for, I believe, at least 12 people.

107
00:08:44,669 --> 00:08:45,089
Wonderful.

108
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:48,312
What an amazing story, Nico.

109
00:08:48,392 --> 00:08:49,453
Thank you very much for sharing.

110
00:08:49,473 --> 00:08:50,134
Thank you for sharing.

111
00:08:50,835 --> 00:08:51,255
Wonderful.

112
00:08:51,376 --> 00:08:57,823
We, again, the two sides of Organ Donation, the lives that we hold as true heroes and celebrate their life.

113
00:08:57,863 --> 00:08:58,985
It is all about life, eh?

114
00:08:59,265 --> 00:09:03,290
Life being saved and be remembering those ones who sadly have passed away.

115
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:06,632
I do want to say that organ donation is extremely rare.

116
00:09:07,073 --> 00:09:18,161
Only 1% of all deaths happen in a manner that one can become an organ donor and in all of New England last year there was only 256 cases where an individual was able to become an organ donor.

117
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:23,503
philosophy or myth that organ donation is happening every day and that is not the case.

118
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:29,984
And that's why when there's an opportunity to truly help save another life and to honor those loved ones, we want to take every opportunity to do so.

119
00:09:30,345 --> 00:09:33,105
We have two more very powerful stories to share, Maren, thank you so much.

120
00:09:33,445 --> 00:09:36,546
Mike Slaman is one of our great volunteers and he's going to share his story now too.

121
00:09:36,626 --> 00:09:37,566
Mike, thanks so much, appreciate it.

122
00:09:37,586 --> 00:09:37,946
Thanks, Matt.

123
00:09:39,847 --> 00:09:40,307
Thank you, Mike.

124
00:09:42,107 --> 00:09:52,391
Back in 1965, I was diagnosed with a very rare heart condition, and doctors at that time told me not to do strenuous exercise, and my only cure was a heart transplant.

125
00:09:53,271 --> 00:09:57,673
And the first human heart transplant in the world was not performed until two years later in 1967.

126
00:09:57,733 --> 00:10:05,936
I was able to survive over the next 42 years because of cardiac advancements through the Mass General Hospital.

127
00:10:07,118 --> 00:10:18,704
And then on May 29, 2007, my wife and I were about to celebrate our 31st wedding anniversary in the Mass General, and a doctor came in and said, we have a donor heart.

128
00:10:20,045 --> 00:10:26,448
The next day, I received a heart, and my donor saved eight other lives.

129
00:10:28,198 --> 00:10:30,880
My wife and I have become very good friends with our donors.

130
00:10:31,181 --> 00:10:34,023
We've vacationed together in many areas.

131
00:10:35,044 --> 00:10:40,127
And I just want to say how glad I am to be a volunteer.

132
00:10:40,688 --> 00:10:47,473
Every time we tell our stories and if we inspire people and if they become donors, we can save many lives.

133
00:10:47,493 --> 00:10:48,894
Thank you.

134
00:10:49,555 --> 00:10:51,336
Thank you so much for the work you do every day.

135
00:10:51,556 --> 00:10:51,936
Thank you.

136
00:10:52,717 --> 00:10:54,899
Those that may be in need at some point.

137
00:10:54,939 --> 00:10:55,279
Thank you.

138
00:10:56,634 --> 00:11:01,838
Additionally, you are more likely to need a transplant than to become an organ donor.

139
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:07,963
In fact, research in Maryland has indicated you're three times more likely to need a transplant than to become an organ donor.

140
00:11:08,003 --> 00:11:11,746
But that wonderful gift, and these are good examples of individuals personally touched.

141
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:14,508
I also do want to address some of the myths and misconceptions.

142
00:11:14,748 --> 00:11:19,292
There's great TV shows out there with Grey's Anatomy and all these great things that have

143
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:23,094
police and fire and telling really compelling stories because it really is.

144
00:11:23,494 --> 00:11:26,816
Someone's life can mean someone else's saving someone's life after they passed away.

145
00:11:27,216 --> 00:11:31,038
That being said, organ donation is extremely well thought out.

146
00:11:31,518 --> 00:11:34,800
If you are in a coma, you're not being considered as an organ and tissue donor.

147
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:40,566
Unfortunately, organ donation is only considered after you have died, so had a heart attack or brain death.

148
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:43,749
Additionally, police, fire, EMT do a wonderful job.

149
00:11:43,789 --> 00:11:47,232
They have no decision making process in the organ donation process.

150
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:51,677
Their only job is to get you from an incident to the hospital as quickly as possible.

151
00:11:52,077 --> 00:11:55,860
The emergency room doctors and nurses do a wonderful job to help save lives.

152
00:11:56,241 --> 00:12:00,324
Those are different individuals than individuals who make the organ donation process.

153
00:12:00,364 --> 00:12:01,825
They have no say in that process.

154
00:12:01,845 --> 00:12:08,811
So we want to make sure people feel confident registering as an organ and tissue donor, realizing that first and foremost, life is what it is.

155
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,813
Hospital's main job is to help save lives.

156
00:12:11,253 --> 00:12:12,874
Again, age is not a parameter.

157
00:12:12,994 --> 00:12:15,916
People can become organ donors in their 60s, 70s, and 80s.

158
00:12:16,196 --> 00:12:19,739
We ask everyone to consider registering as an organ and tissue donor.

159
00:12:20,099 --> 00:12:27,164
And not lastly, but another one of our wonderful volunteers, Nancy is here to share her powerful story.

160
00:12:27,244 --> 00:12:28,305
Thank you so much.

161
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:45,883
My son, Beau, at 25, had gone through years of difficulty with ADHD, which ended up getting him taken out of school, public school, and I went to Mass General as a med tech.

162
00:12:45,983 --> 00:12:50,864
My career has been in laboratory and the overnight shift, and I went to Mass General to get him help.

163
00:12:51,564 --> 00:12:56,706
It turned out that he got through all the programs, did really well, became a plumber,

164
00:12:57,426 --> 00:13:07,712
was moving out of my house and at a party he had a sudden, without warning, a carotid tear at a party and fell without a heartbeat.

165
00:13:07,732 --> 00:13:16,457
And my particular case was that it was called donation after cardiac death because he had brain activity, but his brain was swelling.

166
00:13:16,957 --> 00:13:21,380
And so I had this unique opportunity of having worked at Mass General

167
00:13:21,873 --> 00:13:32,918
to meet him and his friends in the neuro ICU and ask for a ceremony, a day to say goodbye in a way unique to us that helped me in the healing process.

168
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:35,339
We went down to the OR.

169
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:40,642
His sisters came from California and his sister Emmy said, I don't want Bo to be alone.

170
00:13:41,402 --> 00:13:42,323
I want to be with him.

171
00:13:42,703 --> 00:13:46,885
So we played the Beatles White Album in the OR to comfort us.

172
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:52,139
and give us this time to say goodbye in a way that was family together.

173
00:13:52,439 --> 00:14:04,163
So I had to make the decision to remove his support because eventually he probably would have succumbed, the brain would have swollen enough to cut off his breathing.

174
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:10,965
But instead, because I had worked the night shift and seen the organ bank come in, I had enough

175
00:14:11,886 --> 00:14:19,008
experience to go to the nursing staff when I could see he wouldn't survive and say, I want to be a donor.

176
00:14:19,048 --> 00:14:20,208
I want him to be a donor.

177
00:14:20,548 --> 00:14:21,688
I can do this for him.

178
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:34,071
And the last thing I'll say is that he got into public school and I went to Stoneham High and as we're driving up for senior exams, which was surprising, he graduated and was looking for a new life.

179
00:14:35,051 --> 00:14:39,856
I said to him, you know Beau, you've had more help than everyone else in town put together.

180
00:14:40,497 --> 00:14:42,319
Someday you have to give back.

181
00:14:42,739 --> 00:14:47,004
He turned to me with his big smile and said, don't worry ma, someday I will.

182
00:14:47,945 --> 00:14:52,690
So what I try to do is say that everyone has the opportunity.

183
00:14:53,332 --> 00:14:54,792
to live a life of giving.

184
00:14:55,272 --> 00:15:08,355
And I've just been informed by the organ bank he helped 51 people directly with the leg bones, with a little patch of skin, with his kidneys, with his corneas, with vascular tissue.

185
00:15:08,835 --> 00:15:18,477
And so I can truly say that we have done an honor to his life to make him effectively still helping people and still present.

186
00:15:18,657 --> 00:15:19,217
Bo lives on?

187
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:26,540
I also want to make sure that we acknowledge the wonderful work of the RMV mayor.

188
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,000
Thank you so much for your time doing this.

189
00:15:28,321 --> 00:15:34,803
The RMV each and every day has the opportunity to verbally present the question, would you like to register as an organ and tissue donor?

190
00:15:34,863 --> 00:15:40,666
Again, it is a voluntary gift, but thanks so much to Erin Devaney and her wonderful staff throughout the state for presenting it.

191
00:15:40,726 --> 00:15:42,567
And thank you so much for this opportunity to talk about it.

192
00:15:42,587 --> 00:15:43,287
Thank you very much.

193
00:15:43,307 --> 00:15:45,888
After hearing all of these stories from both sides,

194
00:15:46,508 --> 00:15:51,714
Certainly I send out a challenge to the citizens of Medford and beyond to sign up at the RMV.

195
00:15:52,094 --> 00:15:58,421
Sign up, get your heart, put on your license so that everyone's aware that you are willing to give life into the future.

196
00:15:58,922 --> 00:16:04,487
And with that being said, I have a proclamation on behalf of the city of Medford presented to the New England Organ Bank.

197
00:16:06,297 --> 00:16:15,789
Whereas there are more than 121,000 Americans with more than 5,000 in New England and more than 3,000 in Massachusetts who are currently waiting for a life-saving organ transplant.

198
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:24,941
And whereas there are over 1 million life-enhancing tissue transplants each year that are made possible by the generous donations of cornea, bone, skin, or other tissues.

199
00:16:25,682 --> 00:16:43,403
And whereas, we can all help to save someone's life and benefit up to 50 recipients by signing up to become an organ and tissue donor, by enrolling in the Massachusetts donor registry when we apply for or renew our driver's license, or by registering online at www.donatelifenewengland.org,

200
00:16:44,344 --> 00:17:05,511
And whereas Massachusetts is home to pioneering the efforts of many of the world's first organ transplant surgeon, it is fitting that Massachusetts continue its unique leadership role and join in the national goal of signing up 50% of our driving population to become donors, and is dedicated to making it fast and easy to sign up to save a life through our registry of motor vehicles.

201
00:17:06,451 --> 00:17:10,773
And whereas this observance pays tribute to organ and tissue donors and their families,

202
00:17:11,687 --> 00:17:17,011
whose decision to donate life enables others to receive life-saving organs and tissues for transplant.

203
00:17:17,471 --> 00:17:31,881
Now, therefore, Stephanie M. Burke, Mayor of Medford, Massachusetts, do hereby proclaim April 2016 to be Donate Life Month and urge all citizens of Medford to take cognizance of this event and participate fittingly in its observance.

204
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:32,982
Thank you very much.

205
00:17:35,484 --> 00:17:40,270
Thank you for mentioning the website, donatelifeinnewengland.org, you can register as well.
