1
00:38:21,612 --> 00:38:28,315
[SPEAKER_28]: Can I just add, we have two other students here tonight that actually were the masterminds behind the video, Abigail Brady and Kayla Velmay.

2
00:38:28,835 --> 00:38:29,555
[SPEAKER_22]: OK.

3
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,461
[SPEAKER_22]: Thanks for helping Christina do her amazing project.

4
00:38:47,522 --> 00:38:47,962
[SPEAKER_22]: Nice job.

5
00:38:56,076 --> 00:38:57,957
[SPEAKER_22]: did you guys make that okay I also want to comment on

6
00:39:16,608 --> 00:39:36,318
[SPEAKER_24]: These are fairly new programs within the Method Public Schools and the vocational schools, and we have machinery in there that labs at the Broad Institute have, and that Tufts University even comes down and uses and teaches us children with.

7
00:39:36,818 --> 00:39:45,863
[SPEAKER_24]: We give our students excellent opportunities, and I'm so happy to see this move forward and to see the collaboration

8
00:39:46,455 --> 00:39:49,156
[SPEAKER_24]: amongst different programs.

9
00:39:49,916 --> 00:39:53,697
[SPEAKER_24]: I could not be prouder of our teachers and our students.

10
00:39:54,057 --> 00:39:55,957
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you for representing Medford so well.

11
00:39:56,898 --> 00:39:57,378
Very nice.

12
00:40:03,479 --> 00:40:03,619
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

13
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:04,199
[SPEAKER_06]: Van de Kloot?

14
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:11,181
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Mayor Burke, while we're under suspension, I ask that we bring up the Medford Teachers Association next.

15
00:40:11,221 --> 00:40:14,642
[SPEAKER_06]: They've asked if we could move them up.

16
00:40:15,423 --> 00:40:17,225
[SPEAKER_22]: They are under community participation.

17
00:40:17,245 --> 00:40:20,428
[SPEAKER_22]: There's a member from the Medford Teachers Association that would like to address Ms.

18
00:40:20,448 --> 00:40:21,450
[SPEAKER_22]: Charlene Douglas.

19
00:40:35,144 --> 00:40:35,544
[SPEAKER_22]: Good evening.

20
00:40:35,865 --> 00:40:37,366
[SPEAKER_22]: Your name and address, please, for our record?

21
00:40:37,426 --> 00:40:38,547
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, she needs her glasses.

22
00:40:38,927 --> 00:40:41,649
[SPEAKER_26]: Charlene Douglas, 414 High Street, Medford, Massachusetts.

23
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:44,532
[SPEAKER_26]: And Gina Coppola, 54 Yeomans Ave, Medford, Mass.

24
00:40:46,834 --> 00:40:47,894
[SPEAKER_26]: OK.

25
00:40:48,915 --> 00:40:50,877
[SPEAKER_26]: And I am president of the Medford Teacher Association.

26
00:40:51,718 --> 00:41:00,645
[SPEAKER_26]: And I'm president of the Paraprofessional Association, standing here to let you know that our association wholeheartedly agrees with what you are about to hear from the MTA.

27
00:41:02,366 --> 00:41:02,747
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

28
00:41:03,487 --> 00:41:03,828
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

29
00:41:04,048 --> 00:41:04,348
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

30
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:10,782
[SPEAKER_26]: So many people have come to me in the past two weeks concerned about Mr. Bellson's employment.

31
00:41:11,262 --> 00:41:14,724
[SPEAKER_26]: That is not the reason why we are here tonight.

32
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:21,346
[SPEAKER_26]: We have no interest in his employment, and you will hear soon what we are concerned about.

33
00:41:22,807 --> 00:41:30,790
[SPEAKER_26]: At this point, I'd like to ask all the members of the Medford Teacher Association, McGlynn School, and the Medford Paraprofessional Association to stand.

34
00:41:33,612 --> 00:41:34,752
[SPEAKER_26]: and many are standing in back.

35
00:41:37,873 --> 00:41:48,575
[SPEAKER_26]: So tonight, I am here to speak on behalf of all the teachers at the McGlynn Middle School and on behalf of educators everywhere who stand up for themselves and their students.

36
00:41:49,275 --> 00:42:01,838
[SPEAKER_26]: I am referring specifically to statements made by Superintendent Belson to the Meffitt Police as reported by Captain Kevin M. Phaler in the McGlynn School Investigation Report.

37
00:42:02,259 --> 00:42:02,859
[SPEAKER_26]: dated April 6, 2018.

38
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:17,243
[SPEAKER_26]: I hope you are all as troubled as we are by the inconsistencies in the poor judgment documented in the report and by the unanswered questions that still remain.

39
00:42:18,023 --> 00:42:24,865
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm going to confine my remarks to our deep concerns about statements made by Mr. Belson concerning teachers.

40
00:42:25,725 --> 00:42:31,147
[SPEAKER_26]: Let's begin with the statement by Mr. Belson in response to questions about why he didn't report

41
00:42:31,537 --> 00:42:33,939
[SPEAKER_26]: the discovery of the gun clip to the police.

42
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:41,145
[SPEAKER_26]: On page 24 of the report, he is quoted as saying, rightly or wrongly, I didn't see it as a danger.

43
00:42:41,826 --> 00:42:50,453
[SPEAKER_26]: The report goes on to say, Mr. Bellson stated that after he got busy and quote, really did not deal with it, unquote.

44
00:42:51,034 --> 00:42:54,757
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. Bellson stated that Mr. Edwards is also quote,

45
00:42:55,388 --> 00:43:09,073
[SPEAKER_26]: under a great deal of fire by his faculty," unquote, and that Mr. Edwards currently has an MCAD case and an arbitration case against him.

46
00:43:09,733 --> 00:43:15,715
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. Belson stated that his faculty is angry at him, quote, not happy with us at all.

47
00:43:16,395 --> 00:43:24,138
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. Belson then reportedly thought to himself, quote, this doesn't seem like it should be elevated.

48
00:43:24,572 --> 00:43:27,073
[SPEAKER_26]: You know one more thing, unquote.

49
00:43:27,833 --> 00:43:28,994
[SPEAKER_26]: Let's reflect on this.

50
00:43:29,594 --> 00:43:40,078
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. Belson is telling the police that he decided to downplay the incident to protect Mr. Edwards because members of Mr. Edwards' staff have taken legal action against him.

51
00:43:40,478 --> 00:43:52,262
[SPEAKER_26]: This sends the message that when teachers use the proper legal channels to seek redress of grievances and improvements in teaching and learning conditions in their school, the administration may actually conceal information

52
00:43:52,618 --> 00:43:54,480
[SPEAKER_26]: that could threaten the safety of our schools.

53
00:43:55,160 --> 00:44:00,365
[SPEAKER_26]: That thought process, as described to the police, is very disturbing, but it gets worse.

54
00:44:00,905 --> 00:44:06,210
[SPEAKER_26]: I will now read to you from a selection from the section of the report, starting at the bottom of page 25.

55
00:44:07,351 --> 00:44:13,216
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. Belson stated, quote, I don't know if there's some sort of political setup here to get Jake.

56
00:44:13,737 --> 00:44:15,979
[SPEAKER_26]: Jake is under a bit of fire, unquote.

57
00:44:16,599 --> 00:44:17,460
[SPEAKER_26]: He reiterated,

58
00:44:17,785 --> 00:44:20,748
[SPEAKER_26]: that Mr. Edwards does not get along with some of his teachers.

59
00:44:21,149 --> 00:44:24,472
[SPEAKER_26]: He added that, quote, Jake is a decent human being.

60
00:44:24,813 --> 00:44:26,234
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't see him doing that.

61
00:44:27,015 --> 00:44:29,618
[SPEAKER_26]: That is knowingly throwing away a gun magazine.

62
00:44:30,058 --> 00:44:30,759
[SPEAKER_26]: I just don't.

63
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,020
[SPEAKER_26]: Was he set up?

64
00:44:32,541 --> 00:44:34,203
[SPEAKER_26]: Were they really trying to get him?

65
00:44:34,843 --> 00:44:35,264
[SPEAKER_26]: Unquote.

66
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:45,634
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. Belson is posing a theory to the police that the McGlynn teachers, who do not get along with Mr. Edwards, may have set him up to try and get rid of him.

67
00:44:46,154 --> 00:44:50,776
[SPEAKER_26]: That is the most outrageous, insulting, and implausible theory I have ever heard.

68
00:44:51,297 --> 00:44:56,859
[SPEAKER_26]: It is also a clear attempt to deflect blame from himself and Mr. Edwards onto the teachers.

69
00:44:57,859 --> 00:44:59,200
[SPEAKER_26]: Let me say this clearly.

70
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,882
[SPEAKER_26]: The teachers and other staff at the McGlynn are not to blame.

71
00:45:03,342 --> 00:45:05,963
[SPEAKER_26]: In fact, they actually could have been victims.

72
00:45:06,408 --> 00:45:12,414
[SPEAKER_26]: along with their students if the loaded magazine had been placed in the auditorium for malicious purposes.

73
00:45:13,054 --> 00:45:24,365
[SPEAKER_26]: For Mr. Belson to suggest that the gun clip incident may have been a setup by teachers who don't like Mr. Edwards is disappointing, discouraging, upsetting, disheartening, and false.

74
00:45:25,246 --> 00:45:30,411
[SPEAKER_26]: In fact, that's how the McGlynn teachers feel this year, disappointed, discouraged, and disheartened.

75
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:31,951
[SPEAKER_26]: Here's the reality.

76
00:45:32,571 --> 00:45:47,101
[SPEAKER_26]: The teachers at the McGlynn School have been working under adverse conditions, conditions that led them to come up with their own school improvement proposal called the ABC plan that has constantly ignored through the fall and into the winter of the school year until Mayor Burke took it on.

77
00:45:47,781 --> 00:45:52,885
[SPEAKER_26]: Despite these conditions, the McGlynn teachers have never stopped doing what's right for their students.

78
00:45:53,485 --> 00:45:58,068
[SPEAKER_26]: Following me, you will hear from our McGlynn teachers about how they contribute to the school.

79
00:45:58,607 --> 00:46:06,269
[SPEAKER_26]: the Memphis public school systems, and the community as a whole, even through years of lacking leadership, vision, and support.

80
00:46:07,009 --> 00:46:13,650
[SPEAKER_26]: They are hopeful for change and grateful for the current principal who is in place now and proving to be a strong leader.

81
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:21,372
[SPEAKER_26]: Before I turn the floor over to the teachers, I want to tell you that we are asking for in no uncertain terms.

82
00:46:22,012 --> 00:46:25,192
[SPEAKER_26]: First, we demand a public apology from Mr. Belshen.

83
00:46:25,632 --> 00:46:28,373
[SPEAKER_26]: He should apologize for downplaying the gun clip incident

84
00:46:28,715 --> 00:46:43,358
[SPEAKER_26]: in order to protect Mr. Edwards from criticism as he admitted to the police, and he should apologize by making that suggestion, obviously without a shred of evidence that somehow teachers were behind the gun clip incident to make Mr. Edwards look bad.

85
00:46:44,039 --> 00:46:58,602
[SPEAKER_26]: Second, we want to be assured that the school committee does not share the negative opinions about the McGlynn staff that Mr. Belson stated to the police, and we ask that you make a public statement voicing support for the educators in the McGlynn

86
00:46:58,958 --> 00:47:03,760
[SPEAKER_26]: and indicating that these words are his own and are not shared by the Memphis School Committee.

87
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:04,580
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

88
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:07,921
[SPEAKER_26]: At this point, I invite Brian Vallard up to the mic.

89
00:47:11,583 --> 00:47:12,703
[SPEAKER_26]: And other teachers from McGlynn.

90
00:47:14,244 --> 00:47:16,665
[SPEAKER_33]: Brian Vallard, 716 Main Street in Boxford.

91
00:47:17,505 --> 00:47:18,385
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you, Charlene.

92
00:47:18,566 --> 00:47:20,226
[SPEAKER_33]: As always, we appreciate your support.

93
00:47:20,906 --> 00:47:23,627
[SPEAKER_33]: Good evening, Honorable Mayor Burke, members of the school committee.

94
00:47:24,148 --> 00:47:27,309
[SPEAKER_33]: We are the teachers of McGlynn, and we're here because we care.

95
00:47:28,689 --> 00:47:34,250
[SPEAKER_33]: First and foremost, we'd like to say thank you to those of you who have heard our concerns and have truly listened to us.

96
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:37,311
[SPEAKER_33]: There has been so much positive in the school this year.

97
00:47:37,331 --> 00:47:41,692
[SPEAKER_33]: We are encouraged by all of your efforts to help our school continually improve.

98
00:47:42,312 --> 00:47:47,974
[SPEAKER_33]: We also appreciate your recognition of the wonderful community the teachers and staff have created at the McGlynn.

99
00:47:48,674 --> 00:47:53,035
[SPEAKER_33]: However, we felt that the allegations in the police report could not go unrefuted.

100
00:47:53,836 --> 00:47:59,419
[SPEAKER_33]: McGlynn teachers were extremely shaken and disappointed when we read some of the comments contained within it.

101
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:03,482
[SPEAKER_33]: We honestly don't know how exactly to respond.

102
00:48:04,402 --> 00:48:05,843
[SPEAKER_33]: We feel misrepresented.

103
00:48:06,704 --> 00:48:12,307
[SPEAKER_33]: So we thought what better way to clear the air than by telling you a little bit about what we have been doing with our time.

104
00:48:13,006 --> 00:48:17,607
[SPEAKER_33]: Teachers have been working hard all year, both in and out of school, to educate the youth of Medford.

105
00:48:18,407 --> 00:48:24,789
[SPEAKER_33]: We have stayed positive and focused our innovations on innovations and solutions to make our building better.

106
00:48:25,529 --> 00:48:34,491
[SPEAKER_33]: This year, personally, I stepped up and joined the McGlynn site council, working with administration, faculty, parents, and students to propose positive change.

107
00:48:35,451 --> 00:48:40,632
[SPEAKER_33]: I continued building school community by running the morning show program and highlighting the accomplishments of students.

108
00:48:41,476 --> 00:48:46,041
[SPEAKER_33]: And I worked with Angela Bellini to establish the first annual lip-sync competition.

109
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:55,692
[SPEAKER_01]: Sherry Flint, Fay Street, Boston.

110
00:48:57,620 --> 00:49:05,646
[SPEAKER_01]: This year, I wanted to say that I volunteered to host two different programs outside to help our science department.

111
00:49:06,447 --> 00:49:12,131
[SPEAKER_01]: We hosted the Tufts biology department and we also hosted Concord Consortium.

112
00:49:13,032 --> 00:49:24,740
[SPEAKER_01]: I volunteered to have these groups into my room to give my students an opportunity to experience hands-on activities and curriculum and work with materials that they wouldn't otherwise be able to have

113
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:28,085
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that was very important to me this year.

114
00:49:29,247 --> 00:49:30,950
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think our kids really benefited from that.

115
00:49:31,371 --> 00:49:31,612
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

116
00:49:37,410 --> 00:49:41,854
[SPEAKER_31]: Hi, I'm Amy Villard, 716 Main Street in Foxhurd, Massachusetts.

117
00:49:43,255 --> 00:49:44,656
[SPEAKER_31]: First of all, I love the McGlynn.

118
00:49:44,696 --> 00:49:45,978
[SPEAKER_31]: The McGlynn is my second home.

119
00:49:46,018 --> 00:49:47,219
[SPEAKER_31]: My best friends work here.

120
00:49:47,819 --> 00:49:49,841
[SPEAKER_31]: I love it so much that I married a teacher there.

121
00:49:51,843 --> 00:49:55,686
[SPEAKER_31]: But on top of that, I'm a sixth grade teacher, and I have an amazing team.

122
00:49:55,726 --> 00:50:00,410
[SPEAKER_31]: And I'm going to read a couple of testimonials, not just from me, but from a couple of other members of my team who aren't here tonight.

123
00:50:06,182 --> 00:50:16,211
[SPEAKER_31]: So some of the female 6th grade teachers on our floor in the springtime specifically, we work together to spend lunch with a group of 6th grade girls on Fridays in the spring.

124
00:50:16,311 --> 00:50:17,432
[SPEAKER_31]: Being a middle school girl,

125
00:50:17,932 --> 00:50:19,753
[SPEAKER_31]: As some of us know, it was really, really hard.

126
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:24,937
[SPEAKER_31]: We worked to help the 6th grade girls feel connected and supportive of each other by creating a safe space.

127
00:50:25,377 --> 00:50:30,781
[SPEAKER_31]: Each 6th grade girl receives a hand-delivered personal invitation to join us for a girls' lunch by the end of the school year.

128
00:50:31,101 --> 00:50:33,403
[SPEAKER_31]: This is an opportunity to celebrate all of our strong,

129
00:50:33,803 --> 00:50:34,864
[SPEAKER_31]: and smart girls.

130
00:50:35,264 --> 00:50:40,568
[SPEAKER_31]: Activities include I'm Awesome Because, goal setting, meeting new friends, and what it means to be a middle school girl.

131
00:50:41,689 --> 00:50:45,032
[SPEAKER_31]: Over the past five years, I've organized a running club for McGlynn students.

132
00:50:45,472 --> 00:50:59,123
[SPEAKER_31]: Many of the kids at our schools don't have a ton of things to do after school that are productive, and the kids really enjoy being active, being outside, setting goals, achieving them, and they culminate in a cross-country race in the fall and a little track race in the spring.

133
00:51:01,204 --> 00:51:05,706
[SPEAKER_31]: This testimonial is from Michael Kremen, who's the sixth grade ELA teacher on my team.

134
00:51:06,727 --> 00:51:13,191
[SPEAKER_31]: Over the 13 years that I've worked at the McGlynn, my team and I have purchased many items for students who are living in difficult situations at home.

135
00:51:13,691 --> 00:51:16,953
[SPEAKER_31]: We have brought students shoes, boots, coats, and other clothing.

136
00:51:17,413 --> 00:51:26,919
[SPEAKER_31]: This year, along with Miss Bradshaw, who's our school adjustment counselor, we bought and collected dozens of winter coats, pairs of gloves, and mittens and hats for our students who did not have proper cold weather clothing.

137
00:51:27,399 --> 00:51:32,143
[SPEAKER_31]: I routinely purchase food and snacks for the nurses who have told us how many kids come to school hungry.

138
00:51:32,583 --> 00:51:33,884
[SPEAKER_31]: We do these things quietly.

139
00:51:34,384 --> 00:51:35,525
[SPEAKER_31]: We are not seeking praise.

140
00:51:35,765 --> 00:51:37,927
[SPEAKER_31]: We do them because our students need them to be done.

141
00:51:38,844 --> 00:51:42,066
[SPEAKER_31]: And then finally, Mrs. Taylor, who's the science teacher on my team.

142
00:51:42,726 --> 00:51:50,271
[SPEAKER_31]: She works with Mrs. Trumbull and Mrs. Bellini to start the GEMS Club this year, which is Girls Exploring Math and Science.

143
00:51:50,671 --> 00:51:53,833
[SPEAKER_31]: It's a very unique club to get girls more interested in STEM fields.

144
00:51:54,154 --> 00:51:57,456
[SPEAKER_31]: We've been coming up with a curriculum and exciting activities to get the girls to come back.

145
00:51:57,896 --> 00:52:02,679
[SPEAKER_31]: We have a core group of about 10 students who have been with us since we started, and this includes a few students from the Andrews.

146
00:52:02,999 --> 00:52:04,340
[SPEAKER_31]: We're excited to grow in the years to come.

147
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:05,561
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

148
00:52:10,868 --> 00:52:14,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, I'm Kristen Zeckman, 55 Dunboy Street, Boston.

149
00:52:15,631 --> 00:52:17,372
[SPEAKER_02]: And I teach eighth grade English.

150
00:52:18,153 --> 00:52:23,236
[SPEAKER_02]: And my goal as an English teacher is to get the kids to be more passionate about reading and writing.

151
00:52:23,716 --> 00:52:26,138
[SPEAKER_02]: And wherever they are, that's where I want to take them a step further.

152
00:52:26,278 --> 00:52:29,400
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we do this is through the Scholastic Writing Awards.

153
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:33,042
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a big deal for a middle school student to win.

154
00:52:33,302 --> 00:52:38,385
[SPEAKER_02]: And throughout the past several years, we've had winners in the middle school level from the Midlands specifically.

155
00:52:39,846 --> 00:52:47,372
[SPEAKER_02]: And they often go on to win again in high school, and I think it's a great way for them to be recognized both locally and statewide.

156
00:52:47,392 --> 00:52:51,595
[SPEAKER_02]: I also wanted to mention something that my coworker Brett does.

157
00:52:51,715 --> 00:52:52,495
[SPEAKER_02]: He's sitting over there.

158
00:52:52,896 --> 00:53:06,045
[SPEAKER_02]: He raises money through a GoFundMe site so that we can bring in an acting troupe for Romeo and Juliet and give the kids this authentic learning experience so that they can actually see the show in person, not just act it out in school and things.

159
00:53:06,105 --> 00:53:07,807
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are two examples.

160
00:53:07,907 --> 00:53:08,167
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

161
00:53:15,113 --> 00:53:15,473
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing?

162
00:53:15,834 --> 00:53:17,655
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Ryan McCarthy, 46 Colonial Ave.

163
00:53:17,775 --> 00:53:22,620
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, that was where I grew up, 176 Florence Road, Waltham.

164
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:33,089
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been on staff at the McGlynn since 2004, and I'm very, very proud of my school, our school I should say, and all of the faculty that work there, and the students and the work that they produce.

165
00:53:34,830 --> 00:53:40,115
[SPEAKER_00]: Each year since I've been at school, and I've taken many of your, a couple of your children anyhow on the trip,

166
00:53:41,127 --> 00:53:42,548
[SPEAKER_00]: we go on an environmental camp trip.

167
00:53:43,109 --> 00:53:44,890
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's run completely by teachers.

168
00:53:45,711 --> 00:53:49,453
[SPEAKER_00]: All teachers that attend the trip, you know, go, I think, above and beyond the call of duty.

169
00:53:49,533 --> 00:53:51,915
[SPEAKER_00]: We, you know, we don't go home to our families that night.

170
00:53:52,635 --> 00:53:59,000
[SPEAKER_00]: We create a very positive experience, a formative experience for the seventh graders each year.

171
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:01,221
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've done it, as I've said, every single year that I've been there.

172
00:54:01,761 --> 00:54:09,867
[SPEAKER_00]: And we never have to take parent chaperones because we have, you know, hordes of teachers that are willing to step up and to do the right thing for the kids.

173
00:54:10,826 --> 00:54:21,298
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, beyond that, just quickly, each year, the Medford Family Network, which is an organization, very local, they're looking for charitable donations around Christmas time.

174
00:54:21,939 --> 00:54:26,965
[SPEAKER_00]: Mrs. Derding and others have organized this effort at our building, and each year, my homeroom

175
00:54:27,797 --> 00:54:36,661
[SPEAKER_00]: coordinate an effort, and this year we were able to adopt a family of three, three children that is, and provide them with, you know, over $400 worth of gifts at Christmastime.

176
00:54:37,141 --> 00:54:40,963
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, again, teachers stepping up, making donations, and also the students.

177
00:54:41,303 --> 00:54:42,564
[SPEAKER_00]: The teachers are motivating the students.

178
00:54:43,044 --> 00:54:43,945
[SPEAKER_00]: Very proud of the work we do.

179
00:54:50,868 --> 00:54:51,388
[SPEAKER_29]: Good evening.

180
00:54:51,448 --> 00:54:55,450
[SPEAKER_29]: My name is Patricia Kilbride, 11 Interville Street, Woburn, Massachusetts.

181
00:54:56,065 --> 00:55:08,574
[SPEAKER_29]: I've been a special education teacher in Medford for 11 years, first at the Columbus in the therapeutic learning program, and then I was brought to the McGlynn for the language base, and I now teach grades six, seven, and eight in combination classes.

182
00:55:09,655 --> 00:55:12,317
[SPEAKER_29]: And I just have something to say from the special education teachers.

183
00:55:13,297 --> 00:55:23,925
[SPEAKER_29]: For the past three years, special education teachers and paraprofessionals from the language base, connections, and access programs have worked to include our students in the talent show

184
00:55:24,418 --> 00:55:31,101
[SPEAKER_29]: lip sync battle, the New York trip, environmental camp, and other events.

185
00:55:31,601 --> 00:55:39,905
[SPEAKER_29]: Teachers, paraprofessionals, and parents have collaborated extensively to make these events fun and accessible to our students with special needs.

186
00:55:40,625 --> 00:55:48,869
[SPEAKER_29]: And I myself got to attend the New York trip last year with one of my students, and to see it through her eyes was phenomenal, and it was a great time.

187
00:55:49,229 --> 00:55:49,549
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

188
00:55:57,113 --> 00:55:57,593
[SPEAKER_27]: Good evening.

189
00:55:58,834 --> 00:56:02,395
[SPEAKER_27]: My name's Hong Liu, H-O-N-G Liu, L-I-U.

190
00:56:03,015 --> 00:56:06,976
[SPEAKER_27]: I've been in the public school system, Medford Public School, for 25 years.

191
00:56:07,736 --> 00:56:13,218
[SPEAKER_27]: And for the past five years, I've been teaching as an ELL and math teacher.

192
00:56:14,318 --> 00:56:18,860
[SPEAKER_27]: All I can say is, McLean Middle School is one of the best.

193
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:26,142
[SPEAKER_27]: The teachers are the most highly qualified, most hardworking,

194
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:29,272
[SPEAKER_27]: teachers every single day.

195
00:56:30,813 --> 00:56:33,555
[SPEAKER_27]: This year, I happen to have a heavy load, so I work late.

196
00:56:34,035 --> 00:56:40,760
[SPEAKER_27]: Around 5, 6 o'clock, I still see many teachers working there, including Miss Robin Irving.

197
00:56:41,961 --> 00:56:47,965
[SPEAKER_27]: She is the first to be there getting the coffee for everyone, and she's almost the last one to leave.

198
00:56:48,446 --> 00:56:52,829
[SPEAKER_27]: Many teachers with their children, young children, they work there as if

199
00:56:53,633 --> 00:56:54,073
[SPEAKER_27]: This is it.

200
00:56:54,314 --> 00:56:55,134
[SPEAKER_27]: This is their family.

201
00:56:55,634 --> 00:56:59,157
[SPEAKER_27]: So I want to give a bigger applause to the teachers.

202
00:56:59,757 --> 00:57:19,992
[SPEAKER_27]: Also, I want to say, touched and inspired by the new principal, Mr. Nick Tucci, I helped

203
00:57:21,821 --> 00:57:34,289
[SPEAKER_27]: CQO received two Red Sox luxury suite tickets to help inspire students to be the best and achieve the best with the Mustang Way.

204
00:57:34,589 --> 00:57:34,909
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

205
00:57:34,949 --> 00:57:43,474
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, good evening.

206
00:57:43,934 --> 00:57:46,636
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm Angela Bellini, 68 Glenwood Road, Somerville.

207
00:57:48,545 --> 00:57:51,226
[SPEAKER_16]: I've worked at the McGlynn Middle School for the past six years.

208
00:57:52,326 --> 00:57:55,927
[SPEAKER_16]: During this time, I've dedicated myself to the school and its students.

209
00:57:57,488 --> 00:58:11,672
[SPEAKER_16]: I've stayed late almost every single day, coming up with new, engaging, hands-on labs and activities that allow the children to not only have fun in science, but to access the science curriculum in a really dynamic way.

210
00:58:13,652 --> 00:58:16,713
[SPEAKER_16]: As Mrs. Taylor's testimonial mentioned earlier,

211
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:30,380
[SPEAKER_16]: we piloted a new club called Gems to allow girls from both middle schools to explore and have fun in STEM fields through hands-on lessons.

212
00:58:31,081 --> 00:58:41,187
[SPEAKER_16]: This year, Mr. Villard and I also organized the McGlynn Middle School's first annual lip-sync battle, which allowed the students to have fun expressing themselves on stage and to compete for a trophy.

213
00:58:41,448 --> 00:58:42,328
[SPEAKER_16]: That was pretty awesome.

214
00:58:44,128 --> 00:58:48,952
[SPEAKER_16]: For the past two years, I've also organized the environmental camp trip with help from Ms.

215
00:58:48,992 --> 00:58:49,352
[SPEAKER_16]: Haas.

216
00:58:50,132 --> 00:58:55,696
[SPEAKER_16]: And this trip has been recurring for the McGlynn 7th graders over the past 14 some odd years.

217
00:58:57,218 --> 00:59:02,221
[SPEAKER_16]: This trip becomes a lifelong memory for a lot of the kids, and it went really, really well last week.

218
00:59:02,922 --> 00:59:05,284
[SPEAKER_16]: I was really happy with the way that it turned out.

219
00:59:05,324 --> 00:59:07,765
[SPEAKER_16]: And the kids, I asked them today, absolutely loved it.

220
00:59:07,845 --> 00:59:09,887
[SPEAKER_16]: So it was really, really great.

221
00:59:12,683 --> 00:59:29,267
[SPEAKER_16]: Lastly, myself and several other teachers spent countless hours after school, during vacations, and sometimes on weekends, putting together the thoughtful and comprehensive ABC plan, which was put together in response to the original McGlynn Action Plan that was brought forth to school committee earlier this school year.

222
00:59:30,988 --> 00:59:38,270
[SPEAKER_16]: We want our school to be the best that it can be for the sake of our community and the students that we teach, and that's why we do what we do.

223
00:59:39,855 --> 00:59:46,099
[SPEAKER_16]: We could go on and on about the positive works of our staff, but we don't want to take up all of your evening.

224
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:53,944
[SPEAKER_16]: We encourage all of you to take the time to visit our school and to get to know the amazing staff at the McGlynn.

225
00:59:55,345 --> 01:00:04,331
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you so much for your time and for giving us the opportunity to express how much we care about our students, the school, and each other here at the McGlynn.

226
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:16,241
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you for listening.

227
01:00:16,981 --> 01:00:17,661
[SPEAKER_26]: Have a nice evening.

228
01:00:18,282 --> 01:00:18,742
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

229
01:00:18,762 --> 01:00:23,645
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Nelson?

230
01:00:24,865 --> 01:00:40,014
[SPEAKER_23]: Mayor, members of the school committee, ladies and gentlemen, at no time have I ever said that the McGuinn was a bad school, that the McGuinn teachers did not accomplish things, the McGuinn teachers didn't do a good day's work.

231
01:00:40,954 --> 01:00:42,495
[SPEAKER_23]: From time to time in my role,

232
01:00:42,968 --> 01:00:45,429
[SPEAKER_23]: Sure, I question certain things from time to time.

233
01:00:45,930 --> 01:00:46,610
[SPEAKER_23]: That's my job.

234
01:00:47,370 --> 01:00:48,731
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm supposed to ask questions.

235
01:00:49,111 --> 01:00:49,771
[SPEAKER_23]: That's what I do.

236
01:00:51,212 --> 01:00:57,895
[SPEAKER_23]: Now, when this situation took place, the one person who took the direct heat for it was me.

237
01:00:58,316 --> 01:01:03,979
[SPEAKER_23]: So the comment that I try to deflect the blame is clearly not true, and everyone knows it.

238
01:01:04,699 --> 01:01:06,380
[SPEAKER_23]: I didn't throw anyone else under the bus.

239
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:10,942
[SPEAKER_23]: I took all the heat myself and accepted full responsibility for it.

240
01:01:12,523 --> 01:01:14,504
[SPEAKER_23]: Now, a police investigation is what it is.

241
01:01:15,464 --> 01:01:24,807
[SPEAKER_23]: People ask a lot of questions, and I was asked a lot of questions about a lot of possible scenarios, and what the climate was at that school, and what might be possible.

242
01:01:25,287 --> 01:01:28,168
[SPEAKER_23]: And if you read the report very carefully, you'll see there's a lot of gaps.

243
01:01:29,029 --> 01:01:31,149
[SPEAKER_23]: And some of those gaps do raise questions.

244
01:01:32,010 --> 01:01:38,312
[SPEAKER_23]: And before I go on at this point, Mayor, I'd like to ask the police chief to come up and explain the nature of a police report

245
01:01:39,122 --> 01:01:43,403
[SPEAKER_23]: and to tell you that I answered questions that were put to me.

246
01:01:44,664 --> 01:01:51,605
[SPEAKER_23]: There are some people who declined to answer questions and declined to reveal things, but I didn't.

247
01:01:52,486 --> 01:01:53,526
[SPEAKER_23]: Chief, appreciate it.

248
01:01:58,007 --> 01:01:58,787
[SPEAKER_22]: Name and address, please.

249
01:01:59,788 --> 01:02:03,929
[SPEAKER_30]: I live at 227 Elm Street in Medford,

250
01:02:08,990 --> 01:02:10,611
[SPEAKER_30]: Police Chief here in the City of Medford.

251
01:02:13,112 --> 01:02:16,853
[SPEAKER_30]: I just want to say one thing, if I may, Madam Chairman.

252
01:02:18,014 --> 01:02:19,895
[SPEAKER_30]: I've said it in a number of forums before.

253
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:22,345
[SPEAKER_30]: The schools in Medford are safe.

254
01:02:23,446 --> 01:02:24,707
[SPEAKER_30]: That has to be loud and clear.

255
01:02:25,467 --> 01:02:27,509
[SPEAKER_30]: And they're safe, not by accident.

256
01:02:27,829 --> 01:02:43,100
[SPEAKER_30]: They're safe because of all the people that are seated here tonight that work in those schools every single day, that keep a lid on things, they take care of business, they know who's causing a problem, they do what's appropriate to keep the schools safe.

257
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:45,682
[SPEAKER_30]: They deserve an awful lot of credit.

258
01:02:53,628 --> 01:03:11,825
[SPEAKER_30]: And after this incident broke in February, when we first got the word at the police department about that and then put a plan in place of how we were going to react from that point forward for a short period of time, I had the benefit of working a little bit at the McGlynn School and I saw the love

259
01:03:12,238 --> 01:03:19,123
[SPEAKER_30]: the care and the attention that the teaching staff give to every one of the children that enter that school every single day.

260
01:03:19,583 --> 01:03:23,486
[SPEAKER_30]: Some of the coldest mornings, they were out there greeting them with a smile.

261
01:03:23,546 --> 01:03:25,687
[SPEAKER_30]: I heard happy Monday, happy Tuesday.

262
01:03:27,149 --> 01:03:29,790
[SPEAKER_30]: The young children running up, giving hugs to the teachers.

263
01:03:30,491 --> 01:03:31,652
[SPEAKER_30]: You can't put a price on that.

264
01:03:31,952 --> 01:03:33,553
[SPEAKER_30]: As the commercial says, it's priceless.

265
01:03:34,214 --> 01:03:36,075
[SPEAKER_30]: But that's the type of staff that you have.

266
01:03:36,095 --> 01:03:40,358
[SPEAKER_30]: They're a caring, nourishing environment for the children.

267
01:03:42,039 --> 01:03:52,304
[SPEAKER_30]: The report, obviously you can't put every written word in the report, so it's better than a summary, but it's certainly not, you know, a big volume.

268
01:03:54,125 --> 01:03:59,847
[SPEAKER_30]: Mr. Belson was very open and honest in his interview, very open.

269
01:04:00,168 --> 01:04:01,608
[SPEAKER_30]: I mean, he suggested things.

270
01:04:02,749 --> 01:04:06,851
[SPEAKER_30]: Captain Kevin Fowler was the officer that was charged with the investigation.

271
01:04:07,671 --> 01:04:09,452
[SPEAKER_30]: He did a very thorough investigation.

272
01:04:10,150 --> 01:04:20,993
[SPEAKER_30]: I have to say that Mr. Belson was very open in his interview and maybe to his detriment, maybe that's why we're here this evening, because he said things that maybe some people didn't want to hear.

273
01:04:21,813 --> 01:04:28,974
[SPEAKER_30]: I know in my conversation with Mr. Belson in the past, he wanted to make sure that we left no stone unturned.

274
01:04:29,735 --> 01:04:32,355
[SPEAKER_30]: He wasn't pointing the finger of blame at anyone.

275
01:04:32,935 --> 01:04:39,257
[SPEAKER_30]: He didn't want us to go with just the obvious, you know, what was obvious to us based on what was told to us at that point.

276
01:04:40,045 --> 01:04:43,587
[SPEAKER_30]: Yes, as the police department, we know how to conduct an investigation.

277
01:04:44,047 --> 01:04:50,351
[SPEAKER_30]: But I know that Mr. Belson cares very much about all of the schools, all of the teachers, and all of the students.

278
01:04:50,971 --> 01:04:53,192
[SPEAKER_30]: And I think that's why he left it open-ended.

279
01:04:53,732 --> 01:05:09,181
[SPEAKER_30]: He gave Captain Fowler somewhat of a climate of what was going on in the McGlynn School, just so that Captain Fowler had some kind of basis to say, OK, let's turn this other stone over and see where it leads us.

280
01:05:10,293 --> 01:05:17,640
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't think there was an intent on Mr. Belson's part, and he can speak better than I can about it, to blame any one individual.

281
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:19,021
[SPEAKER_30]: He had questions.

282
01:05:19,822 --> 01:05:26,708
[SPEAKER_30]: Captain Fowler ended his interview with Mr. Belson by asking him, is there anything that you want to add?

283
01:05:27,228 --> 01:05:31,152
[SPEAKER_30]: Anything that maybe I didn't ask that you might want to

284
01:05:32,331 --> 01:05:43,035
[SPEAKER_30]: put out there, and he reiterated some of the things that he had mentioned earlier about some of the climate in the school itself, which is probably not unlike any other school in any other school district.

285
01:05:43,655 --> 01:05:54,758
[SPEAKER_30]: There's always something in play that causes someone who's not totally familiar with what goes on in that school to say, okay, let's go beyond just the obvious, what we have.

286
01:05:55,659 --> 01:05:57,599
[SPEAKER_30]: We asked all of these questions early on.

287
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:58,620
[SPEAKER_30]: What was the motive?

288
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:01,821
[SPEAKER_30]: Why would someone, number one, how did it get into the school?

289
01:06:02,853 --> 01:06:06,254
[SPEAKER_30]: Once I get into the school, how did it disappear from the principal's office?

290
01:06:07,115 --> 01:06:09,435
[SPEAKER_30]: Did it actually make it into the principal's office?

291
01:06:10,996 --> 01:06:12,176
[SPEAKER_30]: A number of people are in there.

292
01:06:12,236 --> 01:06:26,221
[SPEAKER_30]: We heard from some of the people that we interviewed that school's pretty much an open building for a good number of hours after the school day is over with basketball teams, basketball leagues, children coming and going, various doors.

293
01:06:27,462 --> 01:06:28,762
[SPEAKER_30]: Until this incident happened,

294
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:31,301
[SPEAKER_30]: We really didn't have to give much thought to it.

295
01:06:31,822 --> 01:06:37,345
[SPEAKER_30]: Now, it caused everyone to focus and say, we have to tighten up on the security of the building.

296
01:06:39,026 --> 01:06:42,208
[SPEAKER_30]: But that was only brought to light by the interviews that were conducted.

297
01:06:43,449 --> 01:06:46,211
[SPEAKER_30]: If you have specific questions for me, I'd be glad to answer.

298
01:06:46,271 --> 01:06:47,792
[SPEAKER_30]: I just want to clear the air.

299
01:06:48,412 --> 01:06:53,275
[SPEAKER_30]: Mr. Pelson did not want to, he said it numerous times, he didn't want to put anyone under the bus.

300
01:06:53,636 --> 01:06:56,878
[SPEAKER_30]: He accepted blame for not making the notification.

301
01:06:58,245 --> 01:07:07,267
[SPEAKER_30]: And I know in working with Roy in the past, he tries to minimize things, not to disrupt the school system, to keep the learning environment as normal as possible.

302
01:07:08,228 --> 01:07:13,349
[SPEAKER_30]: When we were forming the STARS program in Nemlick, that was Roy's main bone of contention.

303
01:07:13,829 --> 01:07:22,951
[SPEAKER_30]: How do you deal with a major incident, but still keep the learning environment as normal as possible, so that the students aren't disrupted and the teaching staff is not disrupted?

304
01:07:24,012 --> 01:07:24,492
[SPEAKER_30]: I think he,

305
01:07:25,449 --> 01:07:30,350
[SPEAKER_30]: He realizes that in this case, he made an error by not reporting it sooner.

306
01:07:30,851 --> 01:07:32,651
[SPEAKER_30]: If anything, he would have got it off his plate.

307
01:07:32,671 --> 01:07:35,992
[SPEAKER_30]: It would have been on my plate a lot earlier, and then the burden would be on me.

308
01:07:36,372 --> 01:07:37,392
[SPEAKER_30]: What do I do about it?

309
01:07:38,333 --> 01:07:43,494
[SPEAKER_30]: And quite honestly, in this interview, that's the avenue that he was coming from.

310
01:07:44,834 --> 01:07:45,595
[SPEAKER_30]: It was his fault.

311
01:07:45,835 --> 01:07:46,615
[SPEAKER_30]: He took the blame.

312
01:07:47,395 --> 01:07:49,916
[SPEAKER_30]: Are we ever going to find out how that clip got into the school?

313
01:07:50,096 --> 01:07:50,876
[SPEAKER_30]: It doesn't appear.

314
01:07:50,956 --> 01:07:53,917
[SPEAKER_30]: Unless someone out there who has knowledge and wants to come forward now,

315
01:07:55,465 --> 01:07:56,946
[SPEAKER_30]: That's the only way we're going to find out.

316
01:07:57,887 --> 01:08:02,612
[SPEAKER_30]: Were there discrepancies by some of the other individuals that may have been interviewed?

317
01:08:02,732 --> 01:08:11,581
[SPEAKER_30]: There were some discrepancies in the story, in at least one individual's story of what they said about what they knew and what took place.

318
01:08:12,061 --> 01:08:13,563
[SPEAKER_30]: But other than that,

319
01:08:14,250 --> 01:08:28,300
[SPEAKER_30]: I have to say that Mr. Belson was just at the police station giving Captain Fowler a clear overview of what's going on, what the dynamics are in the city, and what the dynamics are at the McGlynn School as a whole.

320
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:32,983
[SPEAKER_30]: But at no time did he blame any individual group.

321
01:08:33,403 --> 01:08:38,887
[SPEAKER_30]: I know there's quotes in there, and I know that maybe some things, when you

322
01:08:39,444 --> 01:08:45,990
[SPEAKER_30]: put a quote in and you don't put the full paragraph in that probably goes along with that quote, things can be taken out of context.

323
01:08:46,030 --> 01:08:52,575
[SPEAKER_30]: And I apologize for that if I caused disruption in the school system for that reason.

324
01:08:53,576 --> 01:09:04,386
[SPEAKER_30]: But I know that the avenue that Mr. Belson was coming from was that, you know, please don't just go with the obvious, turn all the stones over and see where that leads.

325
01:09:04,426 --> 01:09:05,346
[SPEAKER_30]: And that's what was done.

326
01:09:05,426 --> 01:09:06,788
[SPEAKER_30]: That's why there was such a delay.

327
01:09:08,057 --> 01:09:09,599
[SPEAKER_30]: in the investigative report.

328
01:09:09,899 --> 01:09:13,102
[SPEAKER_30]: And unfortunately, we're all upset that we couldn't get a conclusion.

329
01:09:13,122 --> 01:09:20,049
[SPEAKER_30]: There's nothing more frustrating to expend numerous hours and not come up with an answer as to how did the clip get there?

330
01:09:20,170 --> 01:09:21,271
[SPEAKER_30]: Who did it belong to?

331
01:09:22,552 --> 01:09:24,194
[SPEAKER_30]: How did it disappear from the office?

332
01:09:26,176 --> 01:09:30,260
[SPEAKER_30]: And just trying to find, you know, the whodunit patch.

333
01:09:31,860 --> 01:09:33,161
[SPEAKER_30]: And that's what's frustrating.

334
01:09:33,201 --> 01:09:34,802
[SPEAKER_30]: But the report speaks for itself.

335
01:09:36,543 --> 01:09:50,871
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm glad to answer any questions that anyone may have, but I know that, uh, you know, Mr. Bellson was not looking to, uh, certainly not looking to cause this problem here this evening and nor was I. Thank you, chief.

336
01:09:51,151 --> 01:09:52,492
[SPEAKER_23]: I'd like to continue for a minute.

337
01:09:53,853 --> 01:09:59,796
[SPEAKER_23]: As the chief pointed out, I didn't name a single individual at that school or anywhere else.

338
01:10:00,812 --> 01:10:03,855
[SPEAKER_23]: that I thought was responsible for anything.

339
01:10:03,875 --> 01:10:14,904
[SPEAKER_23]: I took the blame myself, even though I never saw the clip, I had no chain of custody of the clip, and I had conflicting opinions coming at me from all angles.

340
01:10:15,865 --> 01:10:16,685
[SPEAKER_23]: But I took the blame.

341
01:10:17,906 --> 01:10:28,135
[SPEAKER_23]: Now, if anyone feels offended or upset, or feels that I did finger them inappropriately, then you have my apology, because that is not my intent.

342
01:10:29,098 --> 01:10:47,213
[SPEAKER_23]: My intent was to aid the police department in their investigation, as the chief said, to leave no stone unturned, to let them know everything that was going on in that school, everything that was happening, because who can possibly know all the things that might have been possible at that point in time?

343
01:10:48,514 --> 01:10:50,916
[SPEAKER_23]: My goal was to aid the police department.

344
01:10:52,958 --> 01:10:58,042
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, it's tough enough some days for all of us in our very respective jobs.

345
01:10:59,112 --> 01:11:00,372
[SPEAKER_23]: But I didn't go there with a lawyer.

346
01:11:01,292 --> 01:11:03,133
[SPEAKER_23]: I didn't ask for any representation.

347
01:11:03,293 --> 01:11:08,914
[SPEAKER_23]: I just simply answered the questions and provided the information that was asked of me.

348
01:11:10,034 --> 01:11:16,055
[SPEAKER_23]: And once again, if there are members of the faculty who feel that I offended them, I apologize.

349
01:11:17,055 --> 01:11:20,116
[SPEAKER_23]: I have no doubt that each of you is a dedicated professional.

350
01:11:20,956 --> 01:11:24,656
[SPEAKER_23]: I have no doubt that each of you wants to do a great job for our young people.

351
01:11:25,556 --> 01:11:28,737
[SPEAKER_23]: And in fact, as I look out, because I've been around a little while,

352
01:11:29,294 --> 01:11:30,454
[SPEAKER_23]: I've probably hired most of you.

353
01:11:31,575 --> 01:11:34,436
[SPEAKER_23]: Probably was the person who signed your employment letter.

354
01:11:36,277 --> 01:11:41,779
[SPEAKER_23]: Clearly, I believe that the McGlynn can be a good school and is a good school.

355
01:11:42,539 --> 01:11:43,900
[SPEAKER_23]: We've had some differences this year.

356
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:44,960
[SPEAKER_23]: That's factual.

357
01:11:46,401 --> 01:11:48,282
[SPEAKER_23]: This isn't brand new this month.

358
01:11:49,782 --> 01:11:56,225
[SPEAKER_23]: But I believe going forward that good things can happen and that if we all put our mind to it,

359
01:11:57,938 --> 01:12:00,618
[SPEAKER_23]: We're going to make a difference, and it's going to work out just fine.

360
01:12:02,479 --> 01:12:03,839
[SPEAKER_23]: So I appreciate your listening.

361
01:12:04,739 --> 01:12:06,599
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm happy to answer any questions anyone has.

362
01:12:08,420 --> 01:12:09,940
[SPEAKER_23]: Mike, do you want to say something at this point?

363
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:11,240
[SPEAKER_23]: OK.

364
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:13,161
[SPEAKER_23]: I have a person with me.

365
01:12:14,161 --> 01:12:17,141
[SPEAKER_22]: Please step forward, please.

366
01:12:23,322 --> 01:12:24,202
[SPEAKER_22]: Your name and address, please.

367
01:12:24,463 --> 01:12:24,723
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

368
01:12:25,503 --> 01:12:27,023
[SPEAKER_19]: My name is Marilyn Bloomsack.

369
01:12:27,947 --> 01:12:31,568
[SPEAKER_19]: I am a former resident of Medford for 52 years.

370
01:12:32,269 --> 01:12:37,770
[SPEAKER_19]: My husband was the city solicitor for the city of Medford for 33 years.

371
01:12:38,471 --> 01:12:49,595
[SPEAKER_19]: I am proud to say that I was a Medford teacher and still am a paying member of NEA and the Massachusetts Teachers Association.

372
01:12:50,515 --> 01:12:56,617
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a distinct pleasure for me to be a teacher, particularly in this city that I love.

373
01:12:57,989 --> 01:13:00,410
[SPEAKER_19]: I've resided here for 52 years.

374
01:13:01,290 --> 01:13:14,796
[SPEAKER_19]: And when I, my youngest of four was in junior high school, had the privilege of being president of the Lawrence Memorial Hospital Auxiliary.

375
01:13:15,216 --> 01:13:26,601
[SPEAKER_19]: And at that point, I was doing a health career fair for the Lawrence Memorial Hospital when Mr. Belson,

376
01:13:27,034 --> 01:13:40,821
[SPEAKER_19]: suggested that I come and help him write a grant called CETA, the Comprehensive Educational Training Act, and the city of Medford received monies for that grant.

377
01:13:41,741 --> 01:13:47,324
[SPEAKER_19]: I wanted to tell you today, to remind you, that we live in very troubled times.

378
01:13:49,585 --> 01:13:53,227
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't envy any one of you elected officials.

379
01:13:53,627 --> 01:13:56,069
[SPEAKER_19]: You're doing the best job that you possibly can.

380
01:13:57,291 --> 01:14:07,333
[SPEAKER_19]: all of the members of the school committee, the city council, the mayor certainly has a big responsibility, but so does Mr. Bellson.

381
01:14:08,313 --> 01:14:09,934
[SPEAKER_19]: You trust him as voters.

382
01:14:10,874 --> 01:14:15,095
[SPEAKER_19]: I trust him as a friend, as a teacher.

383
01:14:15,215 --> 01:14:19,916
[SPEAKER_19]: He was a civics teacher many, many years ago before he became a teacher.

384
01:14:20,476 --> 01:14:26,457
[SPEAKER_19]: He's always had the interest of the teachers and the children in this city.

385
01:14:27,011 --> 01:14:27,431
[SPEAKER_19]: at heart.

386
01:14:28,231 --> 01:14:32,712
[SPEAKER_19]: He is a sincere, dedicated, trustworthy gentleman.

387
01:14:33,552 --> 01:14:38,733
[SPEAKER_19]: He has served the city of Medford diligently for many, many, many years.

388
01:14:39,814 --> 01:14:41,034
[SPEAKER_19]: He's apologized.

389
01:14:41,674 --> 01:14:45,855
[SPEAKER_19]: He might have done wrong, but again, we're in troubled times.

390
01:14:46,995 --> 01:14:56,437
[SPEAKER_19]: We have to trust the chief, Buddy Sacco, all of the people that we elect, and hopefully all of you in your hearts can see

391
01:14:57,033 --> 01:15:01,617
[SPEAKER_19]: that this man deserves your praise and all of you deserve your praise.

392
01:15:02,077 --> 01:15:09,503
[SPEAKER_19]: I salute all of you and say to all of the people behind me that if you want to make a difference, go out and vote.

393
01:15:16,909 --> 01:15:17,370
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

394
01:15:19,544 --> 01:15:20,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mayor Burke.

395
01:15:20,645 --> 01:15:23,707
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to address the McGlynn teachers.

396
01:15:24,728 --> 01:15:42,101
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate their coming down tonight and telling the school committee what individually they've been up to in their classrooms and outreaching with students and to really take a hold this year and in previous years as well, but really to work and

397
01:15:43,984 --> 01:15:46,826
[SPEAKER_06]: maximize the potential for every student at the McGlynn.

398
01:15:47,607 --> 01:15:54,293
[SPEAKER_06]: It's unfortunate that it's under these circumstances, perhaps, but it's always great to hear from our faculty members.

399
01:15:55,854 --> 01:15:58,696
[SPEAKER_06]: I do not make the leap that I think some have.

400
01:15:59,417 --> 01:16:00,578
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a lot of tension.

401
01:16:00,698 --> 01:16:01,378
[SPEAKER_06]: We know that.

402
01:16:01,518 --> 01:16:09,485
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's a fact, that there was tension at the school this year, earlier, and in fact, many of the McGlynn teachers came and addressed the school committee.

403
01:16:09,973 --> 01:16:31,142
[SPEAKER_06]: But in no way, shape, or form does that mean or should it imply that we don't have the greatest respect for our McGlynn teachers, that we don't value their input each and every day, and that we aren't extremely proud to know that these are our staff, our people who are working at the school.

404
01:16:31,823 --> 01:16:33,243
[SPEAKER_06]: I only see bright things.

405
01:16:33,443 --> 01:16:38,926
[SPEAKER_06]: I know there's some turbulent times, but out of turbulent times, we will get better.

406
01:16:39,763 --> 01:16:44,484
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I thank you very much for coming and appreciate the statements of those who came.

407
01:16:45,865 --> 01:16:46,225
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

408
01:16:47,145 --> 01:16:47,845
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Ruggiero.

409
01:16:50,266 --> 01:16:51,866
[SPEAKER_10]: Chief Sacco, can I ask you a question, please?

410
01:16:58,548 --> 01:17:02,789
[SPEAKER_10]: So reading through the report, I can understand some of the teachers' frustrations.

411
01:17:02,909 --> 01:17:05,990
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to make sure this is absolutely clear.

412
01:17:06,791 --> 01:17:17,780
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you or any of your officers believe that Superintendent Belson floated a conspiracy theory that perhaps there was some sort of setup?

413
01:17:18,461 --> 01:17:20,562
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to make sure absolutely clear.

414
01:17:20,823 --> 01:17:23,785
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the answer is obvious, but I want to make sure from your mouth.

415
01:17:24,286 --> 01:17:32,132
[SPEAKER_10]: So none of your officers feel like there was any sort of a sense of Roy Belson trying to say there was some cabal to take down the principal.

416
01:17:32,192 --> 01:17:32,693
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that correct?

417
01:17:35,907 --> 01:17:39,528
[SPEAKER_30]: nor do the officers that were involved in the investigation believe that.

418
01:17:39,768 --> 01:17:47,650
[SPEAKER_30]: It was just something that was put out there as a reminder, as I said earlier, don't just go with the obvious, look at everything.

419
01:17:49,671 --> 01:17:58,133
[SPEAKER_30]: That was not, obviously, if it was something many more people would have been interviewed, we would have conducted the investigation in a different manner.

420
01:17:58,573 --> 01:18:04,535
[SPEAKER_30]: So I think that tells you, as of early March, when we interviewed Mr. Belson,

421
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:06,561
[SPEAKER_30]: Nothing further came from that.

422
01:18:06,621 --> 01:18:14,687
[SPEAKER_30]: We didn't go to any other teacher, administrator, or anyone else that wasn't already on our list to interview based on what we had at that point.

423
01:18:15,327 --> 01:18:20,231
[SPEAKER_30]: So as far as any kind of conspiracy theory, no, we never operated under that.

424
01:18:21,392 --> 01:18:21,532
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.

425
01:18:21,752 --> 01:18:29,778
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to make, from my opinion, from talking, I've had the opportunity, the blessing of talking to a number of the teachers, and I've also talked to a number of the parents.

426
01:18:32,527 --> 01:18:35,573
[SPEAKER_10]: I've heard so many wonderful things about how hardworking

427
01:18:36,848 --> 01:18:42,872
[SPEAKER_10]: almost with, I can't even think of an exception, all of the McGlynn teachers I've talked with.

428
01:18:43,312 --> 01:18:48,716
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just want to express my sincere gratitude for all the hard work you do.

429
01:18:49,656 --> 01:18:52,938
[SPEAKER_10]: As a former teacher myself, I was never a successful middle school teacher.

430
01:18:54,559 --> 01:18:57,681
[SPEAKER_10]: I find middle school teaching the most difficult of all teaching.

431
01:18:58,782 --> 01:19:04,746
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I have a deep, deep appreciation for all the hard work you do, and I thank you very much.

432
01:19:05,866 --> 01:19:13,250
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope that it's pretty clear that this is maybe a misreading or misunderstanding of what the report was made.

433
01:19:13,350 --> 01:19:22,374
[SPEAKER_10]: I do not believe that Roy Bellson ever tried to throw the teachers under the bus as if any of you would ever lay bullets in an auditorium in a safe space.

434
01:19:23,835 --> 01:19:25,476
[SPEAKER_10]: I just can't imagine any of you doing that.

435
01:19:25,496 --> 01:19:28,137
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you, and I'm sorry about this miscommunication.

436
01:19:29,112 --> 01:19:29,872
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Benedetto.

437
01:19:30,453 --> 01:19:31,193
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you very much.

438
01:19:31,674 --> 01:19:58,190
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, I recently found out that, um, I had read the report and the first time I read it, I, I, it didn't jump out at me that the teachers would take it this way because Roy has given, um, Mr. Bellson has given us different scenarios of what could have happened to have that, um, gun clip be left in, in there, whether, um,

439
01:19:59,172 --> 01:20:00,833
[SPEAKER_24]: It was this scenario or many others.

440
01:20:00,913 --> 01:20:04,956
[SPEAKER_24]: He's given a few ideas for people to look at.

441
01:20:05,196 --> 01:20:06,337
[SPEAKER_24]: So it didn't jump out at me.

442
01:20:06,897 --> 01:20:13,682
[SPEAKER_24]: But when it came to my attention and I reread this section, I could see how you would feel and take this in this manner.

443
01:20:14,943 --> 01:20:18,845
[SPEAKER_24]: And for that, as a school committee, I'm sorry that you felt that way.

444
01:20:19,386 --> 01:20:25,750
[SPEAKER_24]: Because I value the work that you do with the students in our community more than I could ever say in words.

445
01:20:26,657 --> 01:20:36,264
[SPEAKER_24]: I value the extra time, the extra mittens when they're cold, the hugs when their parents leave them at the door and they miss their mommy.

446
01:20:36,785 --> 01:20:41,188
[SPEAKER_24]: And I don't care if they're kindergarten or eighth grade, there are days when you miss your mom.

447
01:20:42,409 --> 01:20:47,673
[SPEAKER_24]: So you take care of the students both academically and emotionally.

448
01:20:48,353 --> 01:20:51,095
[SPEAKER_24]: And if your emotions were hurt by this, I feel bad.

449
01:20:51,656 --> 01:20:54,558
[SPEAKER_24]: And as a community member, I want you to know

450
01:20:55,508 --> 01:21:01,090
[SPEAKER_24]: I, as a member of this committee, value your work every single day, every single night.

451
01:21:01,931 --> 01:21:16,636
[SPEAKER_24]: And recently, I was just at your school on Saturday night, and I saw your new assistant principal there, working hard and late and missing an evening out with her family and her friends to make sure your school was safe.

452
01:21:16,756 --> 01:21:16,956
[SPEAKER_24]: Ms.

453
01:21:17,036 --> 01:21:23,999
[SPEAKER_24]: Lu, I don't know if you're here, but I want you to know I appreciate you holding down the foot in this very difficult year.

454
01:21:24,875 --> 01:21:26,156
[SPEAKER_24]: You've done amazing work.

455
01:21:35,561 --> 01:21:43,145
[SPEAKER_24]: And I was at the play the other night, and the kids had the biggest smile, and they performed, and it was so uplifting.

456
01:21:43,205 --> 01:21:52,050
[SPEAKER_24]: And it was after a day I moved my oldest child out of my house, so I was so happy to see kids and see them singing and dancing.

457
01:21:52,491 --> 01:21:55,613
[SPEAKER_24]: even though I was missing my own children being that age again.

458
01:21:56,014 --> 01:22:00,917
[SPEAKER_24]: So it was joyful and happy, and I was glad to see that happening at the McGlynn.

459
01:22:01,357 --> 01:22:10,904
[SPEAKER_24]: So again, I want to thank you all and renew my commitment to you as a committee member, that I am here any time that you feel that you have something to say.

460
01:22:17,408 --> 01:22:23,364
[SPEAKER_22]: If I could just make a comment from the chair, I've had the privilege of getting to know quite a few of you over the past few months.

461
01:22:24,253 --> 01:22:25,674
[SPEAKER_22]: And the job you do is amazing.

462
01:22:26,055 --> 01:22:28,657
[SPEAKER_22]: How much you care about your school is outstanding.

463
01:22:29,317 --> 01:22:31,699
[SPEAKER_22]: And we're just really, really proud to have you there.

464
01:22:32,159 --> 01:22:39,325
[SPEAKER_22]: I hope that parents, fifth grade parents out there, see these wonderful people and change their mind about where they want to send their child.

465
01:22:39,645 --> 01:22:43,989
[SPEAKER_22]: And no disrespect, Mr. DeLiva, but you guys are amazing.

466
01:22:44,409 --> 01:22:45,930
[SPEAKER_22]: You do work every single day.

467
01:22:45,950 --> 01:22:47,051
[SPEAKER_22]: A lot of it goes unnoticed.

468
01:22:47,071 --> 01:22:51,155
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Kremen will be laying all the flags for Memorial Day in just a few short weeks.

469
01:22:51,835 --> 01:22:54,956
[SPEAKER_22]: all on his own because he thinks it's important, and it is important.

470
01:22:55,397 --> 01:23:02,059
[SPEAKER_22]: So there are things that you do on a daily basis that go unnoticed, but you touch so many hearts along the way.

471
01:23:02,180 --> 01:23:08,122
[SPEAKER_22]: So just know that we respect your work, all of the administrators as well, of the work that you do on a daily basis.

472
01:23:08,262 --> 01:23:11,403
[SPEAKER_22]: It's not just education anymore.

473
01:23:11,424 --> 01:23:13,845
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, it's way different than how when we were little.

474
01:23:14,305 --> 01:23:18,907
[SPEAKER_22]: So things have drastically changed, and your patience level and your commitment is outstanding.

475
01:23:20,150 --> 01:23:22,011
[SPEAKER_22]: We support you and we applaud your work.

476
01:23:22,331 --> 01:23:22,712
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

477
01:23:27,475 --> 01:23:36,580
[SPEAKER_26]: So first, I want to say thank you, Mr. Belson, for doing the right thing and for apologizing for these comments that did offend many people.

478
01:23:36,980 --> 01:23:41,483
[SPEAKER_26]: And thank you for the school committee for your support and continued support this year.

479
01:23:41,883 --> 01:23:49,248
[SPEAKER_26]: And we look forward to working with you and making sure that the McGlynn is seen as a truly great school that it is.

480
01:23:49,678 --> 01:23:50,558
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you all very much.

481
01:23:50,578 --> 01:23:50,618
[SPEAKER_26]: Hi.

482
01:23:50,639 --> 01:24:00,544
[SPEAKER_13]: May I have the address, please?

483
01:24:00,844 --> 01:24:03,245
[SPEAKER_13]: Ann Marie Cuneo, 871 Felsway, Mefford, Mass, 02155.

484
01:24:04,626 --> 01:24:10,849
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to say, as a former school committee member, I didn't have the opportunity last time the McGlynn parents came up.

485
01:24:11,329 --> 01:24:15,251
[SPEAKER_13]: But it is, I'm sorry, McGlynn teachers and administration came up.

486
01:24:15,291 --> 01:24:18,853
[SPEAKER_13]: But as a parent of the McGlynn, I want to say that,

487
01:24:19,340 --> 01:24:46,092
[SPEAKER_13]: your strides in your everyday, I'm sorry, it's addressing them, but what you do on an everyday basis is really immeasurable, and if you don't believe us as parents, just think when the older kids that are in high school and in college, when they're all coming back into your building and they're looking for you, that's gratification, and that shows that you're all doing the right thing.

488
01:24:46,572 --> 01:24:51,717
[SPEAKER_13]: So unfortunately, there's high emotions going on, but we are very proud of both of our middle schools.

489
01:24:51,777 --> 01:24:54,659
[SPEAKER_13]: And as parents, I can say I've had them at both schools.

490
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:57,141
[SPEAKER_13]: And you need to find your fit.

491
01:24:57,381 --> 01:25:00,424
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't matter how many children you have, you need to find your fit.

492
01:25:00,504 --> 01:25:02,025
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just want to say thank you to all of you.

493
01:25:02,085 --> 01:25:02,426
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

494
01:25:07,270 --> 01:25:11,173
[SPEAKER_22]: All right, thank you very much for coming tonight.

495
01:25:11,393 --> 01:25:11,714
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

496
01:25:15,008 --> 01:25:17,352
[SPEAKER_22]: Also, while we're under suspension, we have Ms.

497
01:25:17,412 --> 01:25:28,831
[SPEAKER_22]: Melanie McLaughlin and Angela Munsell-Moore regarding family and community engagement, a status update on the investigation, and a successful plan for superintendent and deputy superintendent.

498
01:25:38,353 --> 01:25:41,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, school committee members, Madam Mayor, community.

499
01:25:42,156 --> 01:25:46,440
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Melanie Perkins McLaughlin and I live on Alston Street in Medford.

500
01:25:48,681 --> 01:25:52,324
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi all, I'm Angela Moore and I'm on Vine Street in Medford.

501
01:25:54,106 --> 01:26:00,611
[SPEAKER_04]: So we wanted to come before you folks and before the community to ask some questions that we had and concerns that we had.

502
01:26:01,151 --> 01:26:06,456
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that you know Angela and I as regular attendees of the school committee meetings.

503
01:26:06,496 --> 01:26:07,857
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been coming for several years.

504
01:26:08,875 --> 01:26:10,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Also have children in the school district.

505
01:26:11,057 --> 01:26:14,219
[SPEAKER_04]: I have two high schoolers and a elementary schooler.

506
01:26:14,239 --> 01:26:22,224
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm also the co-chair of the Medford Special Education Parent Advisory Council, representing approximately 800 families in the district.

507
01:26:23,525 --> 01:26:36,154
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the things we wanted to talk about was, it was really interesting to watch tonight's events because so much of what I feel like we all watch tonight is family and community engagement.

508
01:26:37,100 --> 01:26:41,724
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's an important part of what we really need to have as Medford moves forward.

509
01:26:41,824 --> 01:26:50,472
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope that Dr. Edward Vincent watches these archival meetings to understand what it is we are looking for and what we need.

510
01:26:50,592 --> 01:26:59,960
[SPEAKER_04]: And everyone knows that we had a very unfortunate event and we had an unfortunate meeting that occurred in February where there was a lot of heated emotions and where there was a lot of

511
01:27:01,914 --> 01:27:02,294
[SPEAKER_04]: upset.

512
01:27:02,495 --> 01:27:05,897
[SPEAKER_04]: And people talked about that for a long time in the community afterwards.

513
01:27:05,937 --> 01:27:10,361
[SPEAKER_04]: And they talked about how terrible that meeting was in so many different ways.

514
01:27:10,601 --> 01:27:16,186
[SPEAKER_04]: And what wasn't talked about, unfortunately, in my opinion, was what brought that about.

515
01:27:16,706 --> 01:27:23,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Not so much the incident itself, but the lack of family and community engagement in our community.

516
01:27:24,893 --> 01:27:38,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Even this context where you have to be willing to stand up at a podium and speak into a microphone with your back turned to the rest of the community to be able to converse and express what your feelings are.

517
01:27:38,766 --> 01:27:42,968
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I went on to the website earlier today to just sort of look at what the protocol is.

518
01:27:43,049 --> 01:27:46,050
[SPEAKER_04]: And I understand protocol and the need for protocol.

519
01:27:46,190 --> 01:27:49,812
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to get the business part of it going and the meeting moving along.

520
01:27:50,793 --> 01:27:54,395
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, but the website is you have to submit in writing your request.

521
01:27:54,415 --> 01:27:55,736
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to do it a week ahead of time.

522
01:27:55,756 --> 01:27:57,097
[SPEAKER_04]: You have exactly three minutes.

523
01:27:57,117 --> 01:27:59,138
[SPEAKER_04]: You can come up to the podium and you can talk to us.

524
01:28:00,379 --> 01:28:02,580
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not family and community engagement.

525
01:28:03,505 --> 01:28:07,248
[SPEAKER_04]: I had the benefit last year of going to graduate school, and I really enjoyed my time there.

526
01:28:07,268 --> 01:28:16,474
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a great teacher who helped write for the Department of Education at the federal level the family and community engagement guidelines and some material there.

527
01:28:16,594 --> 01:28:20,157
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the things, you know, they talk about is family and community.

528
01:28:20,197 --> 01:28:21,518
[SPEAKER_04]: We're all part of the community.

529
01:28:21,558 --> 01:28:23,399
[SPEAKER_04]: So the teachers that came up tonight are the community.

530
01:28:23,439 --> 01:28:25,581
[SPEAKER_04]: The school committee members are the community.

531
01:28:26,081 --> 01:28:27,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Our shop owners are the community.

532
01:28:27,342 --> 01:28:28,403
[SPEAKER_04]: The parents are the community.

533
01:28:28,763 --> 01:28:31,585
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not just families or teachers or,

534
01:28:33,207 --> 01:28:36,931
[SPEAKER_04]: or people that don't have children, we're all a community together.

535
01:28:36,951 --> 01:28:43,038
[SPEAKER_04]: I had this really great experience last week where I set up an appointment to talk with

536
01:28:44,005 --> 01:28:48,368
[SPEAKER_04]: our new EL director, Paul Texera, and we had the best conversation.

537
01:28:48,689 --> 01:28:59,477
[SPEAKER_04]: We sat in his office for just about an hour and I learned a little bit about him, he learned a little bit about me, and we both walked away from that experience wanting to work together and really wanting to collaborate with each other.

538
01:29:00,038 --> 01:29:05,422
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thought, you know, what would have happened if we hadn't built those relationships with each other, if we didn't know each other?

539
01:29:05,939 --> 01:29:07,620
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what family and community engagement is.

540
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:10,422
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about building relationships and about knowing each other.

541
01:29:11,102 --> 01:29:21,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Folks might recall when this all happened a few months ago, there was a post on social media where one of Mr. Belson's family members talked about who Mr. Belson is as a man.

542
01:29:23,208 --> 01:29:26,590
[SPEAKER_04]: And we heard from his friend earlier talking about who Mr. Belson is as a man.

543
01:29:27,171 --> 01:29:32,675
[SPEAKER_04]: And personalizing Mr. Belson and personalizing each one of us is what builds community and relationship.

544
01:29:33,015 --> 01:29:38,759
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think people are able to relate much better to who he was as a man because we learned about who you are as a man.

545
01:29:39,279 --> 01:29:42,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Tonight, seeing you apologize, we learned about who you are as a man.

546
01:29:42,822 --> 01:29:45,263
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the important piece of family and community engagement.

547
01:29:45,363 --> 01:29:47,124
[SPEAKER_04]: It's collaboration and communication.

548
01:29:47,465 --> 01:29:48,626
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not doing it enough.

549
01:29:49,006 --> 01:29:50,307
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can't say enough about that.

550
01:29:50,347 --> 01:29:51,768
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why I stand before you tonight

551
01:29:52,697 --> 01:29:55,859
[SPEAKER_04]: for more family and community collaboration.

552
01:29:56,279 --> 01:29:57,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Bring people to the table.

553
01:29:57,360 --> 01:29:58,421
[SPEAKER_04]: I was watching Justin tonight.

554
01:29:58,461 --> 01:29:59,922
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so glad Justin's here.

555
01:30:00,702 --> 01:30:02,003
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a relatively new thing.

556
01:30:02,183 --> 01:30:03,224
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a great thing.

557
01:30:04,424 --> 01:30:08,907
[SPEAKER_04]: More roundtable discussion, not having to come up to the podium and ask and talk.

558
01:30:08,987 --> 01:30:10,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you guys were inundated with emails.

559
01:30:10,768 --> 01:30:12,329
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad you were inundated with emails.

560
01:30:12,409 --> 01:30:14,491
[SPEAKER_04]: I say to anybody watching tonight, keep them coming.

561
01:30:14,891 --> 01:30:20,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep communicating, please, because we need you to communicate to make a difference and to make things transparent.

562
01:30:21,655 --> 01:30:32,002
[SPEAKER_04]: So getting to the transparent piece, even in the past few months with everything that's been going on, there's still been sort of concerns around some of the transparency.

563
01:30:32,202 --> 01:30:38,206
[SPEAKER_04]: And what you saw the night in February and what I witnessed, which was frankly traumatizing for me.

564
01:30:38,246 --> 01:30:44,550
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know about other people, but I was sort of shell-shocked when I left there at the anger and the vitriol that was there that night.

565
01:30:44,951 --> 01:30:47,973
[SPEAKER_04]: But I was also really very clear what the message was.

566
01:30:48,133 --> 01:30:50,154
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was, we don't feel like we're being heard.

567
01:30:50,592 --> 01:31:00,036
[SPEAKER_04]: And in any relationship, as people can attest in their marriage or their relationship with their children or what have you, when you feel like you're not being heard, what typically happens?

568
01:31:00,636 --> 01:31:01,176
[SPEAKER_04]: You yell.

569
01:31:01,376 --> 01:31:02,056
[SPEAKER_04]: You're angry.

570
01:31:02,857 --> 01:31:04,157
[SPEAKER_04]: You get out of control.

571
01:31:05,358 --> 01:31:07,198
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you're being heard, you're collaborating.

572
01:31:07,218 --> 01:31:08,039
[SPEAKER_04]: You're working together.

573
01:31:08,199 --> 01:31:09,199
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what we need to do.

574
01:31:09,719 --> 01:31:19,703
[SPEAKER_04]: So in the most recent Committee of the Whole meeting, when we found out by social media that the decision to extend the superintendent's contract went from

575
01:31:20,459 --> 01:31:25,052
[SPEAKER_04]: April to June, that was not family and community engagement.

576
01:31:25,473 --> 01:31:29,183
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a really bad example of the lack of family and community engagement.

577
01:31:29,953 --> 01:31:33,435
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, none of this is personal for me around Mr. Bellison.

578
01:31:34,135 --> 01:31:38,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody knows we've had our differences, Mr. Bellison, but we've always been very professional and respectful with each other.

579
01:31:38,558 --> 01:31:40,999
[SPEAKER_04]: It's never been personal, and it never will be.

580
01:31:42,180 --> 01:31:48,023
[SPEAKER_04]: But in terms of having community transparency, to find out on social media that this decision was reversed was so unfortunate.

581
01:31:48,043 --> 01:31:53,466
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like, oh, it felt like we were moving forward, and we were gaining some momentum and some trust, and then this happened.

582
01:31:54,087 --> 01:31:59,090
[SPEAKER_04]: And you could see it in the response on social media, the way so many community members felt about that.

583
01:32:00,129 --> 01:32:20,815
[SPEAKER_04]: But if they had just been consulted with ahead of time, if people had just had an idea, even the notice was that there's a committee of the whole meeting and that there was going to be some discussion, which frankly was at the same time as the National Honor Society meeting, which is what I was attending, that there was going to be some discussion that this might even be the case, you would have had a much larger turnout, I have no doubt.

584
01:32:21,235 --> 01:32:25,836
[SPEAKER_04]: And people would have felt like they were invested in that decision and had some momentum and part of that decision.

585
01:32:27,021 --> 01:32:40,550
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess what I want to ask as we're talking about transparency and moving forward and, you know, hoping that you folks will hear us, and I know that we've done presentations in the past as a CPAC talking about family and community engagement and the need for it.

586
01:32:41,370 --> 01:32:46,654
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that this is really a fascinating study, frankly, in family and community engagement this past year that we've had here.

587
01:32:47,534 --> 01:32:50,796
[SPEAKER_04]: But I guess the questions I have is, I have a few questions.

588
01:32:54,380 --> 01:33:00,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, I want to mention that we also had a public records request in a few months ago that has not been responded to.

589
01:33:00,483 --> 01:33:08,386
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we try to submit the public records request through the website, we get a mail or DM back that says the public records request is not accessible.

590
01:33:09,007 --> 01:33:12,548
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, I just kind of feel like it's a metaphor for the scenario.

591
01:33:12,929 --> 01:33:15,050
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'd love for folks to look into that as well.

592
01:33:15,150 --> 01:33:17,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if a community member has a public records request,

593
01:33:18,102 --> 01:33:19,584
[SPEAKER_04]: It shouldn't be a male or demon back.

594
01:33:19,764 --> 01:33:26,993
[SPEAKER_04]: And once we've notified the community at the school that it is a male or demon, hopefully it's fixed and people respond to that constituent.

595
01:33:28,595 --> 01:33:34,142
[SPEAKER_04]: So questions we have, how is the community made aware that the vote would be to continue the superintendent contract from?

596
01:33:35,217 --> 01:33:40,202
[SPEAKER_04]: April 30th to June 30th, effectively reversing the February decision.

597
01:33:40,222 --> 01:33:43,265
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm wondering how the community was made aware that that was going to be the vote.

598
01:33:44,046 --> 01:33:45,007
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the first question.

599
01:33:45,267 --> 01:33:50,272
[SPEAKER_04]: The second is, did any school committee members let their community or constituents know

600
01:33:50,783 --> 01:33:52,204
[SPEAKER_04]: this would be a consideration.

601
01:33:52,224 --> 01:33:54,145
[SPEAKER_04]: If so, how was that done?

602
01:33:54,185 --> 01:33:55,886
[SPEAKER_04]: And if not, I'm wondering why.

603
01:33:57,047 --> 01:34:06,873
[SPEAKER_04]: And then also we're wondering about the survey results for the superintendent and how or whether they were shared from the community survey that was done, asking folks what they would like.

604
01:34:08,133 --> 01:34:08,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

605
01:34:10,155 --> 01:34:10,735
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Russo.

606
01:34:11,635 --> 01:34:15,418
[SPEAKER_11]: I can speak quickly to the survey results, like five times now I've written down.

607
01:34:15,438 --> 01:34:16,919
[SPEAKER_11]: Get those results out to the public.

608
01:34:17,639 --> 01:34:18,820
[SPEAKER_11]: The challenge is that

609
01:34:19,929 --> 01:34:28,712
[SPEAKER_11]: they're the open-ended questions, or the other, where you could then become open-ended, is printed like this.

610
01:34:29,532 --> 01:34:40,755
[SPEAKER_11]: And I at least feel a responsibility, although I don't know that it's technically a responsibility, to at least read them all before dumping them into the public.

611
01:34:40,835 --> 01:34:49,138
[SPEAKER_11]: Because a quick search of a couple of words that you might see in a survey, if you have kids, you've probably seen these kinds of words.

612
01:34:49,890 --> 01:34:54,731
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, personal attacks on staff members, that kind of stuff.

613
01:34:54,751 --> 01:35:07,334
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I feel like some things deserve to at least have a conversation about whether they should be redacted from the release or to ask, you know, our lawyer, should this be included in the release?

614
01:35:08,434 --> 01:35:10,074
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just have not been able to get through.

615
01:35:10,114 --> 01:35:19,396
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, I do believe I released to the committee, I don't remember if I released it to the public, the purely, you know,

616
01:35:20,088 --> 01:35:26,692
[SPEAKER_11]: the statistics kind of stuff, which doesn't have anything interesting, like what percentage were men and women and all that other stuff.

617
01:35:28,753 --> 01:35:32,675
[SPEAKER_11]: So if that hasn't been released, I can certainly release that.

618
01:35:33,356 --> 01:35:39,379
[SPEAKER_11]: But honestly, the important and interesting stuff is not in the numbers.

619
01:35:41,969 --> 01:35:46,511
[SPEAKER_11]: There's just really very little surprising in the numbers, although you should still be able to see them.

620
01:35:47,451 --> 01:35:51,292
[SPEAKER_11]: It's in that really detailed stuff that people had to say.

621
01:35:51,312 --> 01:35:57,395
[SPEAKER_11]: And believe me, people had a lot to say on the 470 responses or so.

622
01:35:58,395 --> 01:36:01,036
[SPEAKER_11]: There was nobody who didn't have a lot to say.

623
01:36:01,156 --> 01:36:04,477
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's what I had to say about the survey.

624
01:36:05,078 --> 01:36:11,180
[SPEAKER_22]: If I could just add on the survey, it was used for the search committee purposes to get the search committee off the ground.

625
01:36:12,424 --> 01:36:17,067
[SPEAKER_22]: Everything that happened in the search committee was executive session, basically, the equivalent of it.

626
01:36:17,507 --> 01:36:23,591
[SPEAKER_22]: So now that we're out, you should turn them over and we can redact if there's something offensive.

627
01:36:24,372 --> 01:36:26,213
[SPEAKER_22]: But otherwise, it's benign.

628
01:36:27,013 --> 01:36:27,173
[SPEAKER_22]: Ms.

629
01:36:27,193 --> 01:36:27,714
[SPEAKER_22]: Van de Kloot?

630
01:36:28,194 --> 01:36:31,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Melanie, I just wanted to mention one thing.

631
01:36:31,776 --> 01:36:40,442
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that your call for community and family engagement was heard very much by the school committee and is reflected in the choice of our new superintendent.

632
01:36:41,550 --> 01:36:49,215
[SPEAKER_06]: Certainly, as we went about interviewing people and talking to them, that was a major concern.

633
01:36:49,595 --> 01:37:00,662
[SPEAKER_06]: And in fact, we've picked someone who we feel will be able to broaden family engagement and reach into communities that perhaps have been, not perhaps, but have been underrepresented.

634
01:37:01,482 --> 01:37:09,167
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that that is an extremely important point and that we heard you very clearly

635
01:37:10,050 --> 01:37:19,115
[SPEAKER_06]: and know that that is a concern that we would like to make sure that we're broadening community and family engagement.

636
01:37:20,096 --> 01:37:28,280
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, one of the things that you mentioned about the podium and the way you come here, that's one of the reasons why many of us actually prefer committees of the whole, because it's a much more

637
01:37:28,842 --> 01:37:35,805
[SPEAKER_06]: feeling of collaborative discussion when we're around the table versus here, which is a much more formal presentation.

638
01:37:36,286 --> 01:37:49,252
[SPEAKER_06]: And remember, as you speak, part of the thing is your face is to the camera, and so while you're here, it's always awkward because your face is, you know, your back is to the community, but there's the larger community at home.

639
01:37:52,246 --> 01:37:59,611
[SPEAKER_22]: And as far as that meeting, it was a special meeting of the school committee, it was not a committee of the whole, which is, it's a nomenclature, right, same thing.

640
01:38:00,111 --> 01:38:13,079
[SPEAKER_22]: But that was posted the way all of the meetings were posted, and I know there were some parents that did show up at that meeting, and we held it before the honor society meeting, because three of us went over to that right from the end of that meeting.

641
01:38:13,819 --> 01:38:19,323
[SPEAKER_22]: So it was public, it was as public as any other meeting that we hold, just like tonight.

642
01:38:23,297 --> 01:38:23,957
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Ruggiero.

643
01:38:24,357 --> 01:38:32,719
[SPEAKER_10]: How the issue was brought up, it was, I was under the impression that we were going to discuss the transition strategy.

644
01:38:33,819 --> 01:38:35,560
[SPEAKER_10]: That is the notice that was made.

645
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:45,962
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't, it would have probably been more helpful to the community and to me as a member if the discussion was about continuing Roy Belson's contract.

646
01:38:47,735 --> 01:38:56,108
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I wasn't, personally, I wasn't really prepared to have all the reasons and to rehash through the argument other than what I did.

647
01:38:57,630 --> 01:38:58,552
[SPEAKER_10]: But I share your concerns.

648
01:38:59,668 --> 01:39:07,375
[SPEAKER_10]: because I do believe that it was an important decision to make and I think more community input would have been very helpful, as I made clear during the meeting.

649
01:39:07,395 --> 01:39:20,347
[SPEAKER_22]: Actually, if I could, the meeting posting said the purpose of the meeting is to determine administrative leadership of the school system from May 1st to June 30th, 2018, and to take appropriate actions to implement the same.

650
01:39:20,787 --> 01:39:25,291
[SPEAKER_22]: Further, the school committee may discuss relevant transition plans consistent with the completion

651
01:39:25,792 --> 01:39:27,974
[SPEAKER_22]: of the superintendent's search and selection process.

652
01:39:28,154 --> 01:39:36,262
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but it doesn't say that Roy, just a clarification, it does not say that in addition, Roy Bellson's contract may be extended.

653
01:39:36,562 --> 01:39:42,688
[SPEAKER_10]: The idea of the, while what we, I do not claim that what we did was a violation of open meeting law, I don't think so.

654
01:39:42,768 --> 01:39:43,108
[SPEAKER_10]: It wasn't.

655
01:39:43,148 --> 01:39:49,935
[SPEAKER_10]: But it would have been more clear to the community if that issue of Roy Bellson's extended contract was made more apparent.

656
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:51,400
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you.

657
01:39:51,461 --> 01:39:55,122
[SPEAKER_04]: And Madam Mayor, respectfully, I agree.

658
01:39:55,262 --> 01:40:06,728
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that I didn't go to the meeting myself because I thought that it was a sort of procedural interim, you know, what we were going to do, which I thought was pretty clear that it would likely be deputies.

659
01:40:08,369 --> 01:40:13,031
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, I was uninformed, but it didn't say specifically about Mr. Belson.

660
01:40:13,232 --> 01:40:15,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Had it, I would have been at the meeting.

661
01:40:16,752 --> 01:40:17,312
[SPEAKER_22]: Excuse me.

662
01:40:17,352 --> 01:40:18,473
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that that's the point.

663
01:40:18,533 --> 01:40:19,573
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

664
01:40:19,733 --> 01:40:22,194
[SPEAKER_22]: The committee could vote anything that night.

665
01:40:22,214 --> 01:40:24,075
[SPEAKER_22]: It wasn't dictated what was going to happen.

666
01:40:24,095 --> 01:40:24,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

667
01:40:24,435 --> 01:40:24,975
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand.

668
01:40:24,995 --> 01:40:25,935
[SPEAKER_04]: I totally understand that.

669
01:40:25,955 --> 01:40:29,637
[SPEAKER_04]: But I guess what I'm saying in the interest of family and community engagement, we didn't hear that.

670
01:40:29,757 --> 01:40:33,378
[SPEAKER_04]: And we didn't hear what we needed to hear to be at the meeting.

671
01:40:33,438 --> 01:40:36,539
[SPEAKER_04]: And so from a family perspective, it wasn't communicated effectively.

672
01:40:37,199 --> 01:40:38,620
[SPEAKER_10]: To add on to that point.

673
01:40:39,066 --> 01:40:46,091
[SPEAKER_10]: To add on to that point, I mean, I would like to suggest that these important decisions are made during regular committee meetings.

674
01:40:46,811 --> 01:40:57,738
[SPEAKER_10]: I understand that sometimes we do need to go into executive session or committee of the wholes, but that particular issue should have been televised so the whole community could hear it.

675
01:40:58,679 --> 01:41:04,322
[SPEAKER_10]: It's unfortunate that the community had to sort of hear about it secondhand.

676
01:41:04,383 --> 01:41:06,424
[SPEAKER_10]: It creates an environment of mistrust.

677
01:41:07,896 --> 01:41:08,216
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

678
01:41:08,516 --> 01:41:09,477
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Russo's next.

679
01:41:12,698 --> 01:41:22,282
[SPEAKER_11]: My question, you mentioned about this format, which I don't think anybody actually thinks this is the most enjoyable format, especially that one spot.

680
01:41:22,402 --> 01:41:25,203
[SPEAKER_11]: This is actually much less of a challenge than that spot.

681
01:41:25,563 --> 01:41:36,268
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'm just curious, and I'm not a history teacher, and I have no civics education other than the one I got in high school, but are there other formats for this

682
01:41:37,082 --> 01:41:41,704
[SPEAKER_11]: are implemented in this country that people know of?

683
01:41:42,004 --> 01:41:46,246
[SPEAKER_11]: Or is this really, I mean, I just sort of assume this is the default format everywhere.

684
01:41:47,827 --> 01:41:55,170
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that you look, there can be something as simple as handheld microphones and people could stand at either end and address all of you.

685
01:41:56,191 --> 01:42:01,313
[SPEAKER_04]: It's simple if you think outside of the box a little bit about, well, what feels welcoming and this is not welcoming.

686
01:42:02,254 --> 01:42:03,034
[SPEAKER_04]: It's intimidating.

687
01:42:03,455 --> 01:42:05,777
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what do we do to make somebody feel less intimidated?

688
01:42:05,817 --> 01:42:06,718
[SPEAKER_04]: And I couldn't agree more.

689
01:42:06,738 --> 01:42:09,119
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Dr. Edouard Vincent is going to be all over that.

690
01:42:09,720 --> 01:42:11,782
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm really happy and very pleased.

691
01:42:11,822 --> 01:42:13,683
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you all very much for your hard work on that.

692
01:42:13,723 --> 01:42:15,044
[SPEAKER_04]: I know how hard you worked on that.

693
01:42:15,084 --> 01:42:17,966
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you for the privilege of being on the superintendent search committee.

694
01:42:18,126 --> 01:42:18,947
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a great privilege.

695
01:42:20,108 --> 01:42:20,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

696
01:42:20,989 --> 01:42:21,309
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

697
01:42:22,790 --> 01:42:23,491
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Benedetto.

698
01:42:23,691 --> 01:42:24,011
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

699
01:42:24,191 --> 01:42:25,552
[SPEAKER_24]: I actually requested the meeting.

700
01:42:26,413 --> 01:42:28,975
[SPEAKER_24]: I requested the meeting because May 1st was coming.

701
01:42:29,928 --> 01:42:42,610
[SPEAKER_24]: and my understanding that Mr. Belson was retiring as of April 30th, and that we needed to have an official person named as acting superintendent to get us through the transition.

702
01:42:43,230 --> 01:42:57,453
[SPEAKER_24]: So I had no idea that there were other options at play that were gonna be presented that evening, so I too was shocked that this came up at this meeting,

703
01:42:59,468 --> 01:43:13,453
[SPEAKER_24]: I assumed the vote of the committee, and when the committee voted to extend him to April 30th, I took on that, as that's my new role, is to support him till that point, and then make sure our district has somebody at the helm.

704
01:43:14,134 --> 01:43:16,374
[SPEAKER_24]: So I really pushed to have this meeting.

705
01:43:18,355 --> 01:43:23,857
[SPEAKER_24]: So it was a little quicker than some, and it was a special meeting to discuss it.

706
01:43:24,518 --> 01:43:25,678
[SPEAKER_24]: My understanding, that is,

707
01:43:26,262 --> 01:43:38,909
[SPEAKER_24]: someone within the district would step into that role, whether a deputy, a principal, someone we felt confident, you know, to help us through, because Mr. Belson was also going to be present.

708
01:43:39,389 --> 01:43:48,193
[SPEAKER_24]: And knowing him, as we all do, we know he works way beyond the hours required, and he was being contracted to continue for 25 hours.

709
01:43:48,474 --> 01:43:52,996
[SPEAKER_24]: So he was accessible to help with any bigger issues, and I'm sure

710
01:43:53,477 --> 01:43:58,680
[SPEAKER_24]: with his dedication to this community over all these years that he would wholeheartedly do that.

711
01:43:59,960 --> 01:44:06,964
[SPEAKER_24]: So I honestly was shocked by the outcome of that meeting.

712
01:44:08,124 --> 01:44:10,826
[SPEAKER_24]: It didn't even enter my mind as a possibility.

713
01:44:11,306 --> 01:44:21,211
[SPEAKER_24]: Had I thought that that was a possibility, I would have, like I do usually, hey, important things are being discussed and put it on social media, please come.

714
01:44:22,153 --> 01:44:28,434
[SPEAKER_24]: right, please come, or I would have requested that the meeting be televised, because I have done that also in the past.

715
01:44:29,094 --> 01:44:33,535
[SPEAKER_24]: And I know we're getting new cameras in different areas, so we can do that.

716
01:44:34,956 --> 01:44:38,196
[SPEAKER_24]: Because transparency is extremely important.

717
01:44:39,076 --> 01:44:49,439
[SPEAKER_24]: And people not finding out important information online is, they feel insulted to find it out that way.

718
01:44:52,243 --> 01:45:06,057
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know what to say about the outcome of the meeting, but I can own that I did bring it forward and did not tell a push for it to be because I thought it was just an interest, you know, an interim person stepping in for two months.

719
01:45:07,118 --> 01:45:07,478
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

720
01:45:07,578 --> 01:45:07,738
[SPEAKER_22]: Ms.

721
01:45:07,778 --> 01:45:08,139
[SPEAKER_22]: Mustone.

722
01:45:08,459 --> 01:45:11,522
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Maribel.

723
01:45:11,842 --> 01:45:16,727
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know about everyone, but likewise, I thought someone who was in administration was going to step in.

724
01:45:17,439 --> 01:45:19,800
[SPEAKER_05]: not realizing that's not in their contract.

725
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:32,266
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we did receive multiple angry emails that night and the next morning, I did respond saying, I went in assuming, shame on me, that someone in administration would step into that role per contract.

726
01:45:32,726 --> 01:45:39,429
[SPEAKER_05]: The other option was that the Massachusetts Association School Committees can take someone almost like an emergency superintendent.

727
01:45:39,990 --> 01:45:45,152
[SPEAKER_05]: So to me, having a middle man or middle woman come in for eight weeks, try to transition,

728
01:45:45,968 --> 01:45:50,351
[SPEAKER_05]: while we have, I almost feel like Dr. Maurice is like the Phoenix out of the ashes.

729
01:45:50,451 --> 01:45:54,073
[SPEAKER_05]: Like this is going to be a whole new public school system.

730
01:45:54,873 --> 01:45:58,736
[SPEAKER_05]: And I did not think that was the best choice to have a middle person.

731
01:45:59,116 --> 01:46:11,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but I think Mr. Bellson is, has the knowledge and the history to give our new superintendent and just looking forward that we needed that transition to be smoothly done.

732
01:46:11,363 --> 01:46:11,423
[SPEAKER_05]: And,

733
01:46:12,938 --> 01:46:20,722
[SPEAKER_05]: I know people don't agree with that, but I think it would have been more detrimental to our school system to bring someone in for eight weeks, and I stand by that decision.

734
01:46:21,562 --> 01:46:22,162
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Seng.

735
01:46:22,182 --> 01:46:26,364
[SPEAKER_22]: Do you have a microphone there?

736
01:46:26,644 --> 01:46:26,864
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't.

737
01:46:26,924 --> 01:46:29,085
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, step up.

738
01:46:29,526 --> 01:46:29,986
[SPEAKER_22]: There you go.

739
01:46:31,807 --> 01:46:41,071
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, well, I thank you for coming up and saying what a lot of our community is thinking and has been thinking throughout the past few years.

740
01:46:41,880 --> 01:46:50,267
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'll say, when I read the notice for that meeting, I also didn't take it as you would take the vote that you took.

741
01:46:51,228 --> 01:46:54,911
[SPEAKER_12]: And a lot of adults didn't take it that way either.

742
01:46:55,332 --> 01:46:59,295
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think the notice did say exactly what the meeting would be about.

743
01:46:59,676 --> 01:47:00,256
[SPEAKER_12]: It didn't lie.

744
01:47:00,316 --> 01:47:01,297
[SPEAKER_12]: There were no lies in it.

745
01:47:01,757 --> 01:47:02,938
[SPEAKER_12]: It stated the truth.

746
01:47:03,419 --> 01:47:07,042
[SPEAKER_12]: But there's a part of it that includes communication.

747
01:47:07,888 --> 01:47:14,331
[SPEAKER_12]: and communicating to school committee members, to the general public about what the meeting might entail.

748
01:47:14,851 --> 01:47:20,473
[SPEAKER_12]: And because of laws, you can't talk outside of a meeting.

749
01:47:20,493 --> 01:47:21,894
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the problem.

750
01:47:22,871 --> 01:47:26,554
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, and that's a huge problem that acts as a roadblock.

751
01:47:26,614 --> 01:47:41,524
[SPEAKER_12]: But maybe allowing the public to know via social media, which you guys are all very good about, but to know via social media what might happen in a meeting, and to tell people, come.

752
01:47:41,664 --> 01:47:42,444
[SPEAKER_12]: Come to this meeting.

753
01:47:42,865 --> 01:47:44,166
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that really helps out.

754
01:47:45,026 --> 01:47:49,229
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll say from the student perspective, when we read that on Facebook,

755
01:47:51,361 --> 01:47:55,843
[SPEAKER_12]: when our friends texted the news, there were two reactions, generally.

756
01:47:56,103 --> 01:47:58,804
[SPEAKER_12]: One was, what the heck?

757
01:47:59,564 --> 01:48:01,045
[SPEAKER_12]: How did this just suddenly happen?

758
01:48:01,505 --> 01:48:05,667
[SPEAKER_12]: And the other reaction was, oh, he was in for it.

759
01:48:05,707 --> 01:48:07,248
[SPEAKER_12]: We knew that this would happen anyways.

760
01:48:08,028 --> 01:48:11,529
[SPEAKER_12]: And both reactions aren't positive for our community.

761
01:48:11,629 --> 01:48:17,012
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not positive for the school community, not positive for the general public, not positive for Mr. Bellson and his leadership.

762
01:48:17,892 --> 01:48:20,293
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think a more open culture,

763
01:48:21,707 --> 01:48:30,353
[SPEAKER_12]: the so-called New Medford, I think that's what we want to try and foster, what we want to try and sponsor, and how we deal with these issues going on.

764
01:48:30,853 --> 01:48:47,763
[SPEAKER_12]: So being more open about what meetings might entail, and even, I would say, try more to advertise the committee of the whole meetings, because they're kind of put aside, and they allow for a more relaxed context, but I think it's important for people to know that these are important meetings,

765
01:48:49,305 --> 01:48:51,107
[SPEAKER_12]: important stuff gets done in these meetings.

766
01:48:51,227 --> 01:48:52,488
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's super important.

767
01:48:53,428 --> 01:48:56,130
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know Mr. Russo does this.

768
01:48:56,170 --> 01:48:57,291
[SPEAKER_12]: He does town halls.

769
01:48:57,471 --> 01:48:59,893
[SPEAKER_12]: He does meet the school committee member.

770
01:49:00,313 --> 01:49:04,376
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that's a great way for people in the community to engage with school committee members.

771
01:49:04,597 --> 01:49:09,040
[SPEAKER_12]: So I say we have to take a step back, look at the bigger issue.

772
01:49:09,060 --> 01:49:09,760
[SPEAKER_12]: It's about trust.

773
01:49:10,741 --> 01:49:14,564
[SPEAKER_12]: And we need to build that trust between the general public and the Medford School Committee.

774
01:49:14,604 --> 01:49:17,166
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's trust, but it can be stronger.

775
01:49:18,365 --> 01:49:19,125
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Justin.

776
01:49:19,966 --> 01:49:24,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Very eloquent, Justin, thank you.

777
01:49:24,888 --> 01:49:25,028
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

778
01:49:25,068 --> 01:49:26,669
[SPEAKER_03]: Kretz.

779
01:49:26,849 --> 01:49:47,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, so I, too, that night, I knew we were having a meeting, and we hadn't been able to talk about who would be the interim superintendent, so we got to talk that night, and I thought maybe somebody would be stepping up into that place, but we did have to make a decision in the best interest of everybody, like the students and the staffing

780
01:49:48,175 --> 01:49:50,856
[SPEAKER_03]: while we waited to hire our new superintendent.

781
01:49:50,916 --> 01:50:03,660
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I stand by my decision, and it was more of in the best interest of the schools and the students to keeping, you know, so we would have the training until the end of the school year.

782
01:50:03,981 --> 01:50:07,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I have been getting a lot of questions from parents, who's gonna be the superintendent?

783
01:50:08,002 --> 01:50:09,302
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's also been confusion.

784
01:50:09,723 --> 01:50:11,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people thought we already hired a superintendent.

785
01:50:12,143 --> 01:50:14,344
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just been a little bit of confusion all around.

786
01:50:15,685 --> 01:50:16,465
[SPEAKER_03]: But so,

787
01:50:17,136 --> 01:50:20,298
[SPEAKER_03]: I stand by the decision that I made that night as well.

788
01:50:20,618 --> 01:50:21,118
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Ms.

789
01:50:21,138 --> 01:50:21,418
[SPEAKER_22]: Kretz.

790
01:50:21,618 --> 01:50:22,339
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Benedetto?

791
01:50:22,459 --> 01:50:23,699
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you so much, Mayburg.

792
01:50:24,140 --> 01:50:32,084
[SPEAKER_24]: I still have some questions, so I need some transparency and clarity on what exactly the superintendent's role is for the rest of this year.

793
01:50:32,484 --> 01:50:37,647
[SPEAKER_24]: Will he be, will he have whole power as the superintendent?

794
01:50:37,687 --> 01:50:43,770
[SPEAKER_24]: Will he be hiring and moving people from, and promoting people and providing raises?

795
01:50:44,234 --> 01:50:49,736
[SPEAKER_24]: And I also heard a few rumors that he's telling people that he's going to be here beyond June 30th.

796
01:50:50,476 --> 01:50:51,856
[SPEAKER_24]: Is that a possibility?

797
01:50:51,956 --> 01:50:54,117
[SPEAKER_24]: Is there something about that happening?

798
01:50:56,138 --> 01:51:00,019
[SPEAKER_24]: I just want to put it all out here while we're on camera and everybody's in the room.

799
01:51:00,839 --> 01:51:05,481
[SPEAKER_24]: I just have these general questions and if someone could answer them for me and any other questions that come up.

800
01:51:06,181 --> 01:51:12,783
[SPEAKER_24]: I just want to know are the rules we put in place in February for him to continue to April 30th still in place?

801
01:51:13,420 --> 01:51:16,082
[SPEAKER_24]: or have they been removed?

802
01:51:16,202 --> 01:51:18,444
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm really not sure what we voted for that night.

803
01:51:18,904 --> 01:51:21,587
[SPEAKER_22]: None of those other restrictions have been removed.

804
01:51:22,287 --> 01:51:33,496
[SPEAKER_24]: So he cannot hire people or move people or give raises or promotions unless it's like something to just provide services till June 30th.

805
01:51:33,636 --> 01:51:40,662
[SPEAKER_24]: Anything beyond that, our new superintendent would be making those choices, like department heads and all of that.

806
01:51:41,302 --> 01:51:42,103
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, of course.

807
01:51:42,583 --> 01:51:54,632
[SPEAKER_24]: And the rumors that I'm hearing that he's telling people that he might be staying past June 30th, has anybody talked to him about doing any consulting beyond that point?

808
01:51:54,652 --> 01:51:58,135
[SPEAKER_24]: No, this body has not talked about that.

809
01:51:58,895 --> 01:51:59,056
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

810
01:51:59,076 --> 01:52:00,056
[SPEAKER_06]: Van de Kloot.

811
01:52:00,637 --> 01:52:08,763
[SPEAKER_06]: Mayor Burke, I just think that there may be positions that we want the superintendent to move on, and so I'm not,

812
01:52:09,476 --> 01:52:10,816
[SPEAKER_06]: excluding that as a potential.

813
01:52:10,876 --> 01:52:12,177
[SPEAKER_06]: But they have to be reviewed by us.

814
01:52:12,277 --> 01:52:15,238
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, but they would be, we would be part of that discussion.

815
01:52:15,498 --> 01:52:24,601
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, of course, you know, um, and you know, I think the superintendent has made it very clear that he would also want to include, uh, the superintendent elect as well.

816
01:52:25,321 --> 01:52:34,724
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but to say there's going to be nothing happening to, um, until July 1st, I don't want that to be, um, the feeling there,

817
01:52:35,383 --> 01:52:37,084
[SPEAKER_06]: there certainly needs to be movement.

818
01:52:37,444 --> 01:52:43,926
[SPEAKER_06]: For instance, we might very well want to solidify our principal at the McGlynn, for example.

819
01:52:45,287 --> 01:52:47,067
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't want to wait until July 1st to do that.

820
01:52:47,287 --> 01:52:51,189
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, I would like to see the new superintendent make those choices.

821
01:52:51,609 --> 01:52:58,912
[SPEAKER_24]: If that superintendent told us that they had flexibility in coming forward, I'm sure Mr. Belson can give

822
01:53:00,682 --> 01:53:11,908
[SPEAKER_24]: the information, but the final decision, even restructuring of the central administration, you know, putting those positions back in place, I think that should be the new superintendent's place.

823
01:53:12,248 --> 01:53:20,892
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't think that a new superintendent should step in and, you know, have to work with what's been hired from an outgoing superintendent.

824
01:53:21,212 --> 01:53:26,395
[SPEAKER_24]: His input can be done by June 30th, and then the new superintendent should have the final decision.

825
01:53:27,449 --> 01:53:29,732
[SPEAKER_22]: We have positions like director of foreign language.

826
01:53:30,453 --> 01:53:32,856
[SPEAKER_22]: Interviews are scheduled to begin.

827
01:53:32,876 --> 01:53:34,298
[SPEAKER_22]: It's already been posted.

828
01:53:34,318 --> 01:53:35,800
[SPEAKER_22]: We have applications in.

829
01:53:36,661 --> 01:53:39,965
[SPEAKER_22]: Neil from City Hall on diversity is going to be sitting in on the interviews.

830
01:53:40,546 --> 01:53:42,869
[SPEAKER_22]: And then when they make a recommendation, it will come to us.

831
01:53:43,427 --> 01:53:44,308
[SPEAKER_22]: We need to move forward.

832
01:53:44,348 --> 01:53:46,089
[SPEAKER_22]: We cannot just go into freeze.

833
01:53:46,489 --> 01:53:48,451
[SPEAKER_20]: These sirens are going off everywhere.

834
01:53:48,571 --> 01:53:53,115
[SPEAKER_20]: Is there a way to include the new superintendent-elect in those visitors?

835
01:53:53,135 --> 01:53:55,436
[SPEAKER_22]: I asked her the other night if I could.

836
01:53:55,797 --> 01:54:11,449
[SPEAKER_22]: I asked her the other evening if she would have some, an opportunity to assist us, and she said she would try to the best of her ability, this is before we offered her the position, that she has a commitment to Boston through the end of the year, but she would make every effort to rearrange her schedule so that she could

837
01:54:12,377 --> 01:54:15,958
[SPEAKER_22]: help us get through things and possibly even be part of the budget process.

838
01:54:16,398 --> 01:54:20,859
[SPEAKER_24]: So, Mayor Burke, can I answer that question about the director of foreign language?

839
01:54:20,939 --> 01:54:32,043
[SPEAKER_24]: For instance, so say the new superintendent wants our foreign languages to develop in a different road than we currently have in MEDFED.

840
01:54:33,163 --> 01:54:34,543
[SPEAKER_24]: Maybe a different language.

841
01:54:35,083 --> 01:54:40,085
[SPEAKER_24]: So say the new director of foreign language teaches

842
01:54:42,067 --> 01:54:46,308
[SPEAKER_24]: a program that we might not be moving forward for for the next five years.

843
01:54:46,748 --> 01:54:53,449
[SPEAKER_24]: I would hate for that to happen when the new superintendent, like she talked about Mandarin in one of her interviews.

844
01:54:53,529 --> 01:54:55,990
[SPEAKER_24]: I remember her speaking about that.

845
01:54:56,210 --> 01:55:02,791
[SPEAKER_24]: So she might have a new direction and new programs in her mind of how to move Medford forward.

846
01:55:02,831 --> 01:55:11,213
[SPEAKER_24]: And if we hire someone in a role that has what we currently have and what not our future is going to be,

847
01:55:11,622 --> 01:55:13,143
[SPEAKER_24]: we could be tying our hands.

848
01:55:13,423 --> 01:55:18,647
[SPEAKER_24]: So that's why the importance of not hiring directors are important to me.

849
01:55:18,767 --> 01:55:37,982
[SPEAKER_24]: So I really would like to either let her make those decisions on, you know, bring the finalists to her, maybe do the preliminary work, but really have some more input from the new superintendent and what her vision for our school district is going to be rather than the outgoing superintendent.

850
01:55:38,428 --> 01:55:44,334
[SPEAKER_24]: and someone have to work within those restraints.

851
01:55:45,715 --> 01:55:51,700
[SPEAKER_23]: So let me try to address this a little bit so we can clarify these things for everyone's benefit.

852
01:55:52,901 --> 01:55:58,066
[SPEAKER_23]: I have had a very extensive conversation with Dr. Edward Vincent.

853
01:55:58,887 --> 01:56:01,109
[SPEAKER_23]: She met with us before she toured our schools.

854
01:56:02,200 --> 01:56:16,571
[SPEAKER_23]: We had a good exchange of ideas of what was necessary to happen so that when she came aboard, she wouldn't be mired in doing a lot of functional and organizational things that would take an extraordinary amount of time.

855
01:56:18,433 --> 01:56:20,314
[SPEAKER_23]: We have a number of open positions.

856
01:56:21,796 --> 01:56:30,963
[SPEAKER_23]: Any departmental position that got hired would be subject to the professional status law, which means they only have one year.

857
01:56:33,023 --> 01:56:36,926
[SPEAKER_23]: So if in fact they did get hired, they could be replaced within that one year.

858
01:56:38,047 --> 01:56:45,634
[SPEAKER_23]: The second piece is that to leave all these things for an individual to come in would destabilize the school system.

859
01:56:45,954 --> 01:56:53,301
[SPEAKER_23]: We have after school programs, a director of early childhood is leaving, they run the after school programs, they oversee the family network.

860
01:56:53,701 --> 01:56:55,302
[SPEAKER_23]: All these things have to be taken care of.

861
01:56:56,103 --> 01:56:56,864
[SPEAKER_23]: I can assure you

862
01:56:57,922 --> 01:57:05,643
[SPEAKER_23]: that the mayor and I have talked considerably about including people in the discussions, including Mr. Osborne, so we can promote diversity.

863
01:57:07,184 --> 01:57:13,325
[SPEAKER_23]: But I can assure you that the way we hire administrators is they always come before you, remember?

864
01:57:13,765 --> 01:57:15,305
[SPEAKER_23]: These major administrative positions.

865
01:57:16,065 --> 01:57:17,165
[SPEAKER_23]: And you get a chance to input.

866
01:57:18,246 --> 01:57:22,026
[SPEAKER_23]: And I'm sure that Dr. Edward Vinson will have every opportunity to input.

867
01:57:22,666 --> 01:57:26,267
[SPEAKER_23]: But if we stop our business right now, in July,

868
01:57:27,614 --> 01:57:35,180
[SPEAKER_23]: Our successor is going to have one heck of a responsibility to put things together in two months, less than two months before school opens.

869
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:37,822
[SPEAKER_23]: And that's not a desirable outcome.

870
01:57:38,862 --> 01:57:43,966
[SPEAKER_23]: Secondly, there are a whole pile of responsibilities with teachers and other things of that type.

871
01:57:44,647 --> 01:57:49,130
[SPEAKER_23]: Leaves of absence, maternities, all kinds of things that have to be dealt with.

872
01:57:50,791 --> 01:57:51,592
[SPEAKER_23]: Got to be dealt with.

873
01:57:52,252 --> 01:57:54,194
[SPEAKER_23]: You don't want to drop that on your new person.

874
01:57:55,731 --> 01:57:57,792
[SPEAKER_23]: I can assure you that you're going to be involved.

875
01:57:59,392 --> 01:58:04,895
[SPEAKER_23]: I can assure you that Dr. Edward Vincent's going to be involved, because I'm rooting for her success.

876
01:58:05,275 --> 01:58:05,975
[SPEAKER_23]: That's what I do.

877
01:58:07,556 --> 01:58:08,676
[SPEAKER_23]: I want to finish strong.

878
01:58:09,617 --> 01:58:20,081
[SPEAKER_23]: The only reason I'm needing to stay on is because there is a gap, not because I wouldn't have something to do if I wasn't in this role.

879
01:58:21,421 --> 01:58:22,982
[SPEAKER_23]: As Mrs. DiBenedetto pointed out,

880
01:58:24,435 --> 01:58:26,397
[SPEAKER_23]: I probably wouldn't work 25 hours a week.

881
01:58:26,437 --> 01:58:28,618
[SPEAKER_23]: I'd probably work 80 hours a week or 60 hours a week.

882
01:58:30,419 --> 01:58:31,500
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm going to work it anyway.

883
01:58:33,081 --> 01:58:44,410
[SPEAKER_23]: But having the level of authority to do what needs to be done, to put things in place, to handle the collective bargaining that has to go on at this point in time is in your best interest.

884
01:58:45,931 --> 01:58:51,095
[SPEAKER_23]: I can sit back, not do anything, but that means my successor

885
01:58:52,155 --> 01:58:53,536
[SPEAKER_23]: is gonna have an awful lot to do.

886
01:58:54,176 --> 01:59:02,600
[SPEAKER_23]: I would rather she comes in to a stable environment and have the opportunity to move her ideas and programs forward, and I will root for her.

887
01:59:03,541 --> 01:59:06,683
[SPEAKER_23]: And I will work with her and give her as much support as she needs.

888
01:59:08,263 --> 01:59:20,890
[SPEAKER_23]: But not to take care of the routine business of this school system, not to ensure that the partnership, some of the things that are on tonight's agenda, won't go forward, would be a disservice to you, to the community, and to her.

889
01:59:21,993 --> 01:59:26,794
[SPEAKER_23]: So I respectfully request that you allow me to do what I have to do.

890
01:59:27,715 --> 01:59:29,595
[SPEAKER_23]: I can assure you that you'll be involved.

891
01:59:30,255 --> 01:59:32,256
[SPEAKER_23]: I can assure you that she will be involved.

892
01:59:32,776 --> 01:59:47,680
[SPEAKER_23]: And I can assure you that any decision we make will be something that's collaborative and not an individual decision on my part, except for the routine kinds of things that have to happen day to day to keep the school system in place.

893
01:59:48,460 --> 01:59:50,401
[SPEAKER_23]: So I appreciate your concerns.

894
01:59:51,383 --> 01:59:53,845
[SPEAKER_23]: I want to assure you that that's my intent.

895
01:59:54,425 --> 01:59:55,926
[SPEAKER_23]: Let's finish strong together.

896
01:59:56,086 --> 01:59:57,567
[SPEAKER_23]: Let's have a good balanced budget.

897
01:59:58,167 --> 01:59:59,929
[SPEAKER_23]: Let's put a budget together next year.

898
02:00:00,389 --> 02:00:10,235
[SPEAKER_23]: That's going to be reflective of the things that you want to see and that will give our new superintendent an opportunity to innovate and do the things that will make the school system move forward.

899
02:00:10,836 --> 02:00:12,677
[SPEAKER_23]: I appreciate you listening.

900
02:00:13,277 --> 02:00:14,018
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Benedetto.

901
02:00:14,418 --> 02:00:15,359
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, a few things.

902
02:00:15,739 --> 02:00:18,481
[SPEAKER_24]: Number one, can we get a list of those positions that, um,

903
02:00:19,822 --> 02:00:25,825
[SPEAKER_24]: are necessary to move forward so that—I know we asked for a list of retirements.

904
02:00:26,186 --> 02:00:47,097
[SPEAKER_24]: It wasn't added to the back of the agenda for reports, so we had asked for a list of retirements or open positions for next year, so that will be helpful for us to know what interviews are happening, what's going on, because, like, I did not have any idea that those interviews were happening for the foreign language department at this point.

905
02:00:48,534 --> 02:00:50,235
[SPEAKER_24]: That would be helpful as committee.

906
02:00:50,876 --> 02:00:58,261
[SPEAKER_24]: Also, I'd like to, through you, to address the superintendent about the rumors that he plans on staying after June 30th.

907
02:00:58,341 --> 02:01:00,242
[SPEAKER_24]: Is that your intention, Mr. Belson?

908
02:01:01,503 --> 02:01:01,884
[SPEAKER_14]: Rumors?

909
02:01:02,784 --> 02:01:03,885
[SPEAKER_24]: Reporting on rumors.

910
02:01:04,105 --> 02:01:07,287
[SPEAKER_23]: The world is filled with rumortism, and that paralyzes everyone.

911
02:01:08,508 --> 02:01:11,631
[SPEAKER_23]: The reality is that this is my community.

912
02:01:12,431 --> 02:01:15,473
[SPEAKER_23]: If my community needs me to help, I'll be available.

913
02:01:15,934 --> 02:01:17,815
[SPEAKER_23]: If my community doesn't need me to help,

914
02:01:18,640 --> 02:01:23,401
[SPEAKER_23]: with or without compensation, of course, then that won't be there.

915
02:01:23,941 --> 02:01:25,321
[SPEAKER_23]: I certainly won't be a trucee.

916
02:01:25,861 --> 02:01:31,482
[SPEAKER_23]: But I've got to believe that a new superintendent is going to have a lot of questions once they get into the weeds.

917
02:01:33,423 --> 02:01:34,383
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm a phone call away.

918
02:01:34,823 --> 02:01:35,783
[SPEAKER_23]: I live down the street.

919
02:01:36,223 --> 02:01:39,544
[SPEAKER_23]: And I'm more than happy to help, because this is my community.

920
02:01:40,364 --> 02:01:47,545
[SPEAKER_23]: I've been superintendent and been in this school system longer than some people in this room have been alive.

921
02:01:48,357 --> 02:01:49,537
[SPEAKER_23]: And this is my community.

922
02:01:50,298 --> 02:01:52,678
[SPEAKER_23]: And I don't intend to reject my community.

923
02:01:53,078 --> 02:01:55,099
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't intend to walk away from my community.

924
02:01:56,379 --> 02:02:04,942
[SPEAKER_23]: But I don't expect, necessarily, that I would ever intrude on the prerogatives of my successor, on the school committee, or anyone else.

925
02:02:05,702 --> 02:02:06,622
[SPEAKER_23]: But will I be helpful?

926
02:02:07,003 --> 02:02:07,583
[SPEAKER_23]: Of course I will.

927
02:02:08,143 --> 02:02:11,644
[SPEAKER_23]: I expect the school system to build on a very firm foundation.

928
02:02:12,364 --> 02:02:14,785
[SPEAKER_23]: I expect the school system to progress and do well.

929
02:02:16,069 --> 02:02:23,593
[SPEAKER_23]: So I'm not walking away, but I'm not intruding, and I'm available if I'm needed, and I will help wherever I can.

930
02:02:24,573 --> 02:02:24,953
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

931
02:02:26,094 --> 02:02:26,314
[SPEAKER_22]: Ms.

932
02:02:26,334 --> 02:02:27,754
[SPEAKER_22]: Van de Kloot, are you all set?

933
02:02:27,814 --> 02:02:28,095
[SPEAKER_22]: No, yep.

934
02:02:32,819 --> 02:02:38,287
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanted to address a couple of the other points that we've sort of moved past, including the public records requests.

935
02:02:38,928 --> 02:02:47,359
[SPEAKER_10]: It's important that the public as being a public body, we are under all the laws that govern public requests.

936
02:02:47,980 --> 02:02:54,045
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have a subcommittee of community relations, but I think this issue is sort of, I would like to have all the members present.

937
02:02:54,225 --> 02:03:03,713
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'd like to make a motion that we have a committee of the whole meeting where we can address, go through all of the items that are important, including maybe having a mic stand in the back corner.

938
02:03:04,393 --> 02:03:07,556
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, if there is a disabled person, we could just hand them the mic.

939
02:03:08,632 --> 02:03:12,194
[SPEAKER_10]: or talking about public requests, where all these issues can be addressed.

940
02:03:12,394 --> 02:03:17,236
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'd like, like I said, to make a motion that we have a committee of the whole meeting to address all community engagements.

941
02:03:28,202 --> 02:03:33,627
[SPEAKER_22]: But there is an individual at the school that is responsible and at the city that's responsible on our side as well.

942
02:03:33,647 --> 02:03:33,827
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

943
02:03:33,947 --> 02:03:39,471
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I've made public requests and people have been very helpful, but it's unacceptable that emails bounce.

944
02:03:39,632 --> 02:03:44,916
[SPEAKER_10]: But beyond that, there are other issues that we need to discuss about community engagement, community relation.

945
02:03:44,956 --> 02:03:46,137
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to do that as a body.

946
02:03:46,457 --> 02:03:47,298
[SPEAKER_10]: So that'd be my motion.

947
02:03:48,699 --> 02:03:49,300
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Russo.

948
02:03:50,681 --> 02:03:54,384
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you be clear as to what this meeting would do and be about?

949
02:03:54,862 --> 02:03:59,605
[SPEAKER_11]: because we just had a conversation about an agenda item that was too vague for people.

950
02:03:59,705 --> 02:04:05,648
[SPEAKER_11]: So once people read this agenda, they need to know whether they care and they're gonna go there.

951
02:04:06,129 --> 02:04:12,212
[SPEAKER_11]: So this list, that's not anywhere good enough in my mind to vote for a meeting.

952
02:04:13,133 --> 02:04:20,377
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we can work with the chair and just sort of add items on the agenda that would be, like we normally would when we have a meeting request.

953
02:04:21,077 --> 02:04:23,759
[SPEAKER_10]: But basically the broad outline would be

954
02:04:24,612 --> 02:04:27,915
[SPEAKER_10]: how to discuss increasing community engagement on the school committee.

955
02:04:27,935 --> 02:04:30,257
[SPEAKER_22]: And that is exactly what this committee is about.

956
02:04:30,357 --> 02:04:32,199
[SPEAKER_22]: So it really does belong with the committee.

957
02:04:33,160 --> 02:04:35,062
[SPEAKER_22]: And we follow Robert's Rules of Order.

958
02:04:35,642 --> 02:04:38,485
[SPEAKER_22]: And that's how we conduct our meetings here, these public meetings.

959
02:04:38,565 --> 02:04:40,006
[SPEAKER_22]: It's all through Robert's Rules of Order.

960
02:04:41,107 --> 02:04:42,589
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's the structure.

961
02:04:42,609 --> 02:04:46,152
[SPEAKER_22]: And most formal committees adopt those standards.

962
02:04:48,572 --> 02:05:02,840
[SPEAKER_20]: Can I just continue with what we also wanted to speak about, and something that I brought to your attention two years ago, and if it had been properly acted upon, we would not really be in the situation we're in right now.

963
02:05:03,781 --> 02:05:09,344
[SPEAKER_20]: And two years ago, I did ask for a solid succession plan for the superintendent position.

964
02:05:10,084 --> 02:05:16,528
[SPEAKER_20]: At the time, I do believe it was misconstrued, and people thought it was simply me saying about Mr. Bellison, but it wasn't.

965
02:05:16,548 --> 02:05:17,789
[SPEAKER_20]: It could have been anybody sitting up there.

966
02:05:19,204 --> 02:05:23,507
[SPEAKER_20]: And now we're poised to hire a new superintendent and there's still no plan.

967
02:05:24,587 --> 02:05:37,915
[SPEAKER_20]: I felt at the time the request was definitely belittled and ultimately the plan that was presented included the scenario we're actually placed in now, where there's an untimely or unexpected vacancy.

968
02:05:38,455 --> 02:05:42,977
[SPEAKER_20]: And I just want to read exactly what the plan that was put forth actually says.

969
02:05:42,997 --> 02:05:47,620
[SPEAKER_20]: It says, if the superintendent is unable to perform his duties for any reason,

970
02:05:48,340 --> 02:05:51,502
[SPEAKER_20]: The deputy superintendent would become the interim superintendent.

971
02:05:52,882 --> 02:05:56,104
[SPEAKER_20]: And then it goes on, but we wouldn't have to do a school committee search, obviously.

972
02:05:56,684 --> 02:06:04,788
[SPEAKER_20]: The current school system administration is an experienced team that can handle transition and maintain operations for an extended period of time.

973
02:06:05,548 --> 02:06:08,750
[SPEAKER_20]: We have an assistant superintendent, director of finance and administration.

974
02:06:09,386 --> 02:06:16,748
[SPEAKER_20]: Director of Pupil Services, Director of Building and Grounds, as well as assistant principals and departmental directors in place.

975
02:06:16,948 --> 02:06:19,269
[SPEAKER_20]: Each would be able to carry out their essential functions.

976
02:06:20,629 --> 02:06:33,573
[SPEAKER_20]: So, with that being said, I'm not really sure why we're in a situation where we had to reverse a decision if this is what was put forth as the succession plan.

977
02:06:34,393 --> 02:06:36,054
[SPEAKER_20]: If a proper plan had been in place,

978
02:06:36,811 --> 02:06:49,544
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't think it could have been proposed or justified that your decision was reversed because of a lack of a succession plan or that there were people that were supposed to be taxed with the job who were not available to do so.

979
02:06:51,791 --> 02:06:59,535
[SPEAKER_20]: Ultimately, I think it just highlights what our community is feeling, that we're not being heard, that you're unwilling to actually be proactive.

980
02:06:59,595 --> 02:07:06,319
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, it was almost exactly two years ago that I asked for something to be done, and it's still not done.

981
02:07:06,559 --> 02:07:12,403
[SPEAKER_20]: And now we're hiring a new superintendent, and we're still going to be at ground zero for what happens.

982
02:07:13,443 --> 02:07:15,545
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, we know now what a search involves.

983
02:07:16,745 --> 02:07:25,429
[SPEAKER_20]: and we know what we want, but all of this needs to be in place before, I believe, before Mr. Belson leaves because you're obviously going to need his input.

984
02:07:26,249 --> 02:07:33,912
[SPEAKER_20]: So what I'm asking for you tonight is an actual commitment and a date to have an actual solid succession plan.

985
02:07:35,133 --> 02:07:39,995
[SPEAKER_20]: Like I said, I believe Mr. Belson's input will be invaluable because there's just a lot of policy and

986
02:07:40,692 --> 02:07:43,753
[SPEAKER_20]: knowledge in his head that needs to be put in writing somewhere.

987
02:07:44,653 --> 02:07:50,335
[SPEAKER_20]: There's boilerplate plans that you can get that are fairly inexpensive that can sort of bring this along more quickly.

988
02:07:51,275 --> 02:08:04,439
[SPEAKER_20]: Ultimately it needs to be done now and it all just ties back to a better engagement of engaging your community and like I said, I know I was belittled and it's just a lack of respect for community participation.

989
02:08:04,519 --> 02:08:09,140
[SPEAKER_20]: It's the we know better, how dare you ask, we can handle it.

990
02:08:10,282 --> 02:08:11,062
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's unfortunate.

991
02:08:12,363 --> 02:08:12,483
[SPEAKER_21]: Ms.

992
02:08:12,543 --> 02:08:13,383
[SPEAKER_21]: Van de Kloot, you want to?

993
02:08:14,144 --> 02:08:14,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

994
02:08:14,564 --> 02:08:16,605
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just want to mention a couple of things.

995
02:08:17,085 --> 02:08:37,174
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that at the time, as we consider potential people who would fill, at least in my head, and I guess I have to speak for myself, clearly the assistant superintendent, as it is outlined exactly in that, would have been the person who would have been most likely to step into the role.

996
02:08:38,354 --> 02:08:39,695
[SPEAKER_06]: However, she's retiring.

997
02:08:41,166 --> 02:08:41,887
[SPEAKER_06]: The deputy.

998
02:08:42,387 --> 02:08:43,468
[SPEAKER_06]: The deputy superintendent.

999
02:08:43,528 --> 02:08:44,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Beverly Nelson.

1000
02:08:44,348 --> 02:08:45,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1001
02:08:45,129 --> 02:08:45,829
[SPEAKER_06]: So she's retiring.

1002
02:08:45,849 --> 02:08:46,870
[SPEAKER_20]: You said the assistant, sorry.

1003
02:08:47,110 --> 02:08:47,391
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

1004
02:08:48,892 --> 02:08:49,612
[SPEAKER_06]: She's retiring.

1005
02:08:50,353 --> 02:08:58,118
[SPEAKER_06]: This is not the time to ask her in her career as she winds down for her to all of a sudden step into a very difficult role at the last minute.

1006
02:08:59,860 --> 02:09:02,842
[SPEAKER_06]: Another potential would have been Dr. Perella.

1007
02:09:03,702 --> 02:09:07,065
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I don't think it's appropriate to then

1008
02:09:07,565 --> 02:09:13,068
[SPEAKER_06]: ask the guy who you just didn't forward on to the finalists to step into the role.

1009
02:09:15,090 --> 02:09:15,770
[SPEAKER_06]: Things change.

1010
02:09:16,751 --> 02:09:19,772
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that the superintendent is able.

1011
02:09:20,793 --> 02:09:36,863
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe that if, for example, had he taken ill, which thankfully he did not, but had he been taken ill, that people would have put any personal consideration aside because the loyalty to Mr. Belson is extreme amongst the people he's worked with.

1012
02:09:38,578 --> 02:09:46,924
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't think, Angela, that we did not think about the succession plan or that we belittled it.

1013
02:09:47,024 --> 02:09:56,151
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we're going to have to look at it again as we do a new administration comes in to make sure that it all makes sense and look at our people, whatever.

1014
02:09:56,611 --> 02:09:59,974
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't think that was the intent of the school committee just to overlook it.

1015
02:10:00,034 --> 02:10:02,315
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that they were extenuating circumstances.

1016
02:10:04,957 --> 02:10:05,578
[SPEAKER_06]: In my mind,

1017
02:10:06,260 --> 02:10:17,584
[SPEAKER_06]: there was only one thing that was important, and that is, what is in the best interest of the Medford Public Schools right now to ensure an effective transition to the next superintendent?

1018
02:10:19,264 --> 02:10:31,988
[SPEAKER_06]: So, if it, in the, as we now make that transition to a new superintendent, I have no problem at all revisiting that policy, taking a look at it, but essentially, it's going to stand.

1019
02:10:32,568 --> 02:10:33,949
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know,

1020
02:10:35,582 --> 02:10:46,685
[SPEAKER_06]: For me, and you know, the big question of who do we hear, school committee members heard from a lot of people, a lot of people.

1021
02:10:47,385 --> 02:10:58,829
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, there's been a very vocal segment of the community who's been very out there, who's been very upset with Mr. Belson, and there's been a whole lot of other people who've supported him.

1022
02:11:00,209 --> 02:11:02,830
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel that we are elected

1023
02:11:04,333 --> 02:11:19,599
[SPEAKER_06]: in the most difficult circumstances to keep our eye on the prize and be able to separate ourselves from all the different opinions we hear, no matter how difficult it is, and say, what is the most important thing going forward?

1024
02:11:21,240 --> 02:11:25,321
[SPEAKER_06]: For me, it was to say, how do we make the best transition?

1025
02:11:25,482 --> 02:11:26,422
[SPEAKER_06]: And in my mind,

1026
02:11:27,168 --> 02:11:39,033
[SPEAKER_06]: It was at this point, given the circumstances that presented itself, it was to keep an experienced superintendent who had dedicated his life to Medford to move forward through the next eight weeks.

1027
02:11:40,534 --> 02:11:48,457
[SPEAKER_20]: And I understand where your reasoning comes from, but with all due respect, you've known for months that the deputy was retiring.

1028
02:11:48,497 --> 02:11:56,280
[SPEAKER_20]: You've known for months now that Mr. Belson was going to be retiring early, and there was never a mention, not that any of us have ever heard,

1029
02:11:57,105 --> 02:12:00,807
[SPEAKER_20]: that there was not going to be a person to fill the position.

1030
02:12:01,427 --> 02:12:23,637
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to add, I do just feel like I need to add in this situation, I was at the school committee meeting two years ago when Angela came up to the podium and asked very respectfully what the plan was, and it was embarrassing, and I think there was only probably one or two other people in the audience, but there were lots of people watching at home, and it was embarrassing and humiliating, and I felt terribly for Angela in that experience.

1031
02:12:23,657 --> 02:12:25,158
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember writing an email to

1032
02:12:25,614 --> 02:12:27,095
[SPEAKER_04]: the school committee after that meeting.

1033
02:12:27,455 --> 02:12:30,857
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually befriended Angela as a result of that meeting.

1034
02:12:31,017 --> 02:12:34,718
[SPEAKER_04]: It was entirely unfortunate, and it was two years ago.

1035
02:12:34,738 --> 02:12:34,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

1036
02:12:36,439 --> 02:12:36,819
[SPEAKER_06]: van de Kloet.

1037
02:12:37,640 --> 02:12:45,343
[SPEAKER_06]: So I understand that that evening was unfortunate and did not play well.

1038
02:12:45,363 --> 02:12:53,567
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that you meant the question now in a respectful way, and that we responded by saying, hey, this is the plan.

1039
02:12:54,328 --> 02:12:54,428
[SPEAKER_06]: OK?

1040
02:12:55,227 --> 02:12:58,168
[SPEAKER_06]: There were extenuating circumstances which happened, okay?

1041
02:12:58,208 --> 02:13:04,411
[SPEAKER_06]: There's another person who might have been a potential, but it wasn't a good time for her to take the role.

1042
02:13:08,692 --> 02:13:16,616
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to look at the large picture and determine what was the best course.

1043
02:13:17,256 --> 02:13:19,417
[SPEAKER_06]: And I understand there are a lot of people who disagree with us.

1044
02:13:20,360 --> 02:13:31,723
[SPEAKER_06]: The only thing that I can say is that there are five people who are extraordinarily different in many, many ways, and yet five of us agreed that this was the best path.

1045
02:13:32,443 --> 02:13:41,565
[SPEAKER_06]: Two did not, and I respect my colleagues for their decision, but this is the way it operates in our public discourse of majority rules.

1046
02:13:41,965 --> 02:13:43,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Five of us agreed that this was the best way.

1047
02:13:45,206 --> 02:13:46,006
[SPEAKER_06]: In going forward,

1048
02:13:46,731 --> 02:13:51,235
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely, especially if we have any changes in the way that we operate at central administration.

1049
02:13:51,555 --> 02:13:56,459
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll need to come up with a new succession plan in case we have, and hopefully we won't.

1050
02:13:56,859 --> 02:13:59,021
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully we won't in the future.

1051
02:14:00,182 --> 02:14:08,448
[SPEAKER_06]: We wish our new superintendent-elect a long and hopefully blissful reign as being superintendent.

1052
02:14:09,729 --> 02:14:10,270
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Russo.

1053
02:14:12,126 --> 02:14:12,466
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1054
02:14:13,507 --> 02:14:17,609
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm a software developer and have been for 20 years.

1055
02:14:19,229 --> 02:14:33,676
[SPEAKER_11]: And one of the things that I learned probably a couple of years ago, quite surprisingly in an article, was about 80% of what I write for software, if I'm doing my job correctly, is exception handling, is handling the unexpected.

1056
02:14:34,777 --> 02:14:39,659
[SPEAKER_11]: And the reason I bring that up is that as a body, when we write policies,

1057
02:14:41,462 --> 02:14:51,905
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a choice, not sure it's always necessarily a conscious choice, but we have a choice about whether to make the policies robust to handle the unexpected.

1058
02:14:53,006 --> 02:15:06,310
[SPEAKER_11]: And in software, where literally the entire environment is completely controlled by me, 80% of what I'm writing is to deal with the wild, crazy things that are happening.

1059
02:15:07,050 --> 02:15:09,651
[SPEAKER_11]: But in a human endeavor, which is everything we're talking about,

1060
02:15:10,662 --> 02:15:17,724
[SPEAKER_11]: it's probably 99.999% of the possibilities are not within the control of anybody in this room.

1061
02:15:18,604 --> 02:15:37,889
[SPEAKER_11]: And my point is just that when we write a policy, if we try to write policies that are truly robust and can handle endless scenarios, and the people in this room could write for months and never finish coming up with scenarios for how any policy probably won't work.

1062
02:15:39,230 --> 02:15:40,090
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know,

1063
02:15:40,591 --> 02:15:56,481
[SPEAKER_11]: we can either focus on a single policy for weeks and months and probably years and still never get it right, or we can rely on the fact that we're gonna come together when it doesn't work right and then deal with that, maybe make a tweak to the policy and move forward.

1064
02:15:57,241 --> 02:16:00,303
[SPEAKER_11]: And in my mind, there is just not the bandwidth.

1065
02:16:01,724 --> 02:16:08,949
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't just mean my personal time, but I mean this meeting to get our policies

1066
02:16:10,237 --> 02:16:27,449
[SPEAKER_11]: perfect, or even close to perfect, because that's not a reality, even in situations like my job, where I am in control in a way that is not a reality in the human experience.

1067
02:16:27,889 --> 02:16:38,877
[SPEAKER_11]: So do I think it's better to have a one or two page policy that has holes you can drive a truck through if the building burns down, or if all the superintendent

1068
02:16:39,343 --> 02:16:45,166
[SPEAKER_11]: deputy and everybody with a superintendent license goes to a conference and, you know, they shut down the airlines.

1069
02:16:45,507 --> 02:17:02,937
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, we could go on and on for how the policy could be better and more robust, but then the simplest of policies will be a book that nobody will read, nobody will know what it says, and you won't be able to use it when you actually need it.

1070
02:17:03,597 --> 02:17:08,900
[SPEAKER_11]: So I want our policies to be as simple as they can be

1071
02:17:09,499 --> 02:17:11,520
[SPEAKER_11]: without, too simple.

1072
02:17:12,220 --> 02:17:20,202
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, you know, a succession plan that said if we needed a new superintendent for an unfortunate reason was we'd get a new superintendent.

1073
02:17:20,302 --> 02:17:22,743
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, that's obviously too simple.

1074
02:17:23,103 --> 02:17:34,886
[SPEAKER_11]: But the number of people in our district that have either a superintendent license or that we could use the MASS to get an emergency superintendent, I mean, that's good enough for me.

1075
02:17:35,126 --> 02:17:36,267
[SPEAKER_11]: One pager's plenty.

1076
02:17:39,101 --> 02:17:41,984
[SPEAKER_11]: we can't cover all the scenarios, and so.

1077
02:17:42,064 --> 02:17:52,333
[SPEAKER_20]: I definitely don't want all scenarios covered, but I would like the major scenario of if position one cannot be filled, who's going to take control?

1078
02:17:52,813 --> 02:18:04,904
[SPEAKER_20]: Because right now, this is what there is, and then you're saying tonight that, well, it doesn't really matter because it's not in the deputy or even the assistant superintendent's contracts that they would step up.

1079
02:18:05,770 --> 02:18:10,413
[SPEAKER_20]: So this, what is on file as the succession plan, is wrong.

1080
02:18:11,454 --> 02:18:12,835
[SPEAKER_11]: So it can be improved, I agree.

1081
02:18:13,195 --> 02:18:14,656
[SPEAKER_20]: Or just start over.

1082
02:18:16,137 --> 02:18:16,257
[SPEAKER_22]: Ms.

1083
02:18:16,277 --> 02:18:19,719
[SPEAKER_22]: Stone, we have a full agenda as well that we need to get on.

1084
02:18:20,120 --> 02:18:30,987
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to say, a parent did email the next day and say, you definitely need to put in the new deputy superintendent's contract that they will step in so that

1085
02:18:31,467 --> 02:18:47,279
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to add that because that isn't currently in the contract, so that doesn't work, which I was, it's a shame on me that I didn't read their contract to know that they did not have to be asked or forced into taking that superintendent's job.

1086
02:18:48,620 --> 02:18:54,484
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's, we can add that to make sure the next deputy superintendent is their job.

1087
02:18:56,005 --> 02:18:57,767
[SPEAKER_24]: Final comment, Mr. Benedetto?

1088
02:18:57,787 --> 02:19:00,088
[SPEAKER_24]: To be clear in transform, trans,

1089
02:19:01,491 --> 02:19:02,392
[SPEAKER_24]: Transparent, thank you.

1090
02:19:02,412 --> 02:19:03,812
[SPEAKER_24]: It's been a long night.

1091
02:19:04,653 --> 02:19:07,214
[SPEAKER_24]: I just want you to know, this didn't come out at that meeting.

1092
02:19:08,095 --> 02:19:10,456
[SPEAKER_24]: We didn't pull out this paperwork and read the policy.

1093
02:19:10,797 --> 02:19:11,157
[SPEAKER_24]: We didn't.

1094
02:19:11,797 --> 02:19:18,601
[SPEAKER_24]: Because if we had, we would have went down to the assistant superintendent when the deputy said that she wasn't able to take that position.

1095
02:19:19,942 --> 02:19:24,525
[SPEAKER_24]: I didn't bring it forward because I was floored by what was being proposed to me at the time.

1096
02:19:24,925 --> 02:19:28,127
[SPEAKER_24]: It didn't enter my mind until someone asked me for a copy of this.

1097
02:19:28,527 --> 02:19:29,668
[SPEAKER_24]: And I went, oh my gosh.

1098
02:19:30,223 --> 02:19:31,743
[SPEAKER_24]: I can't believe I didn't bring this forward.

1099
02:19:31,983 --> 02:19:35,064
[SPEAKER_24]: And our new members probably have never seen this or read this.

1100
02:19:35,704 --> 02:19:37,705
[SPEAKER_24]: So yeah, you're right.

1101
02:19:38,145 --> 02:19:39,425
[SPEAKER_24]: This should have been implemented.

1102
02:19:39,785 --> 02:19:40,966
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm surprised it wasn't.

1103
02:19:42,026 --> 02:19:49,608
[SPEAKER_24]: I would have loved to seen this implemented because I know Mr. Belson wouldn't have left us hanging and he would still be there for vital information.

1104
02:19:49,648 --> 02:19:51,008
[SPEAKER_24]: And I made that point at that night.

1105
02:19:51,368 --> 02:19:54,609
[SPEAKER_24]: So I'm being transparent about what I did and what I didn't do.

1106
02:19:54,869 --> 02:19:55,910
[SPEAKER_24]: I didn't bring this forward.

1107
02:19:56,010 --> 02:19:57,370
[SPEAKER_24]: I didn't think about this item.

1108
02:19:57,965 --> 02:19:59,266
[SPEAKER_24]: This should have been implemented.

1109
02:19:59,386 --> 02:20:10,132
[SPEAKER_24]: This is our policy that we voted on when you brought it forward, when I left you hanging that night, and I apologize for, because I should have said something that evening as well.

1110
02:20:10,573 --> 02:20:14,315
[SPEAKER_24]: So I own what I've done, and I'm going to try to do better.

1111
02:20:14,875 --> 02:20:17,477
[SPEAKER_24]: So, you know, that's all I can do.

1112
02:20:18,617 --> 02:20:26,502
[SPEAKER_24]: And we need to make sure that, you know, we have people like you reminding us, hey, we did this, because we can't remember everything.

1113
02:20:27,102 --> 02:20:35,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, and thank you for everyone out there tonight that's still here, and for folks that are watching at home, we really want to encourage you to remember to come to the school committee meetings.

1114
02:20:36,612 --> 02:20:37,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Let your voice be heard.

1115
02:20:37,593 --> 02:20:39,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Your voice matters, and your vote matters.

1116
02:20:39,615 --> 02:20:39,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1117
02:20:40,276 --> 02:20:41,057
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you very much.

1118
02:20:42,979 --> 02:20:47,123
[SPEAKER_22]: Next item up, recommendation to reject school choice for school year 2018-19.

1119
02:20:50,339 --> 02:20:51,019
[SPEAKER_22]: We have a paper.

1120
02:20:51,119 --> 02:20:53,980
[SPEAKER_22]: Traditionally, we have rejected school choice in this community.

1121
02:20:54,260 --> 02:20:56,961
[SPEAKER_22]: Is there a motion on the floor to reject school choice?

1122
02:20:57,441 --> 02:21:00,502
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Russo, seconded by Ms.

1123
02:21:00,522 --> 02:21:01,103
[SPEAKER_22]: Vandekloot.

1124
02:21:01,503 --> 02:21:02,503
[SPEAKER_22]: Roll call vote, please.

1125
02:21:09,525 --> 02:21:16,728
[SPEAKER_23]: Quick summary is that under school choice, people can

1126
02:21:17,483 --> 02:21:21,705
[SPEAKER_23]: come to our school district for a very low amount of money if we have open seats.

1127
02:21:22,585 --> 02:21:27,827
[SPEAKER_23]: And the cost that we would receive or the compensation received is not worth it to us.

1128
02:21:27,847 --> 02:21:32,529
[SPEAKER_23]: And we would have to educate people that would take seats from other people.

1129
02:21:32,929 --> 02:21:35,070
[SPEAKER_23]: It just doesn't work under the current rule.

1130
02:21:35,390 --> 02:21:40,872
[SPEAKER_23]: If you're a school system that has such open seats and you have no revenue coming in, maybe it makes sense.

1131
02:21:40,912 --> 02:21:41,893
[SPEAKER_23]: That's not our situation.

1132
02:21:43,073 --> 02:21:44,814
[SPEAKER_23]: We have to notify the state by a certain date.

1133
02:21:45,698 --> 02:21:46,638
[SPEAKER_22]: Roll call vote, Ms.

1134
02:21:46,678 --> 02:21:48,479
[SPEAKER_22]: Kretz, to reject school choice.

1135
02:21:50,359 --> 02:21:50,639
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1136
02:21:50,659 --> 02:21:54,000
[SPEAKER_24]: I was just waiting for the wording.

1137
02:21:59,081 --> 02:22:00,961
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1138
02:22:01,001 --> 02:22:01,841
[SPEAKER_22]: Motion passes.

1139
02:22:03,922 --> 02:22:08,423
[SPEAKER_22]: Report on middle school, school year 18-19 enrollment and selection.

1140
02:22:11,503 --> 02:22:11,643
[SPEAKER_22]: Ms.

1141
02:22:11,663 --> 02:22:12,023
[SPEAKER_22]: Nelson.

1142
02:22:13,704 --> 02:22:14,144
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening.

1143
02:22:15,581 --> 02:22:21,823
[SPEAKER_09]: From the report, you can see a little bit of the history of what we've been doing over the past several years.

1144
02:22:22,823 --> 02:22:37,087
[SPEAKER_09]: Since the new middle schools opened in 2001, parents of students in grade 5 have been allowed to choose the middle school that they would like their child to attend, starting in 6th grade.

1145
02:22:37,587 --> 02:22:42,168
[SPEAKER_09]: This system worked very well for a number of years, back and forth a little bit, sometimes the McGlynn

1146
02:22:42,750 --> 02:22:51,993
[SPEAKER_09]: had more kids, sometimes the Andrews went back and forth, until this year, when we really had a big difference in enrollment.

1147
02:22:52,613 --> 02:22:59,875
[SPEAKER_09]: And as you know, this past school year, we had several more fifth graders opting to go to the Andrews.

1148
02:23:00,515 --> 02:23:06,477
[SPEAKER_09]: In total, that was 43, which is more than one class, almost two classes of youngsters.

1149
02:23:07,437 --> 02:23:08,898
[SPEAKER_09]: So as we began to

1150
02:23:10,745 --> 02:23:16,889
[SPEAKER_09]: think about moving forward and how we were going to handle the choice situation.

1151
02:23:17,790 --> 02:23:22,233
[SPEAKER_09]: With your approval, we put the following items in place for this year.

1152
02:23:22,253 --> 02:23:23,314
[SPEAKER_09]: We made some changes.

1153
02:23:23,975 --> 02:23:31,280
[SPEAKER_09]: I will say, too, that the numbers of the Andrews of the students in grade six going to grade seven appears to be constant.

1154
02:23:31,300 --> 02:23:35,663
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're still going to have that larger group moving into grade seven.

1155
02:23:35,683 --> 02:23:38,385
[SPEAKER_09]: There doesn't seem to be any movement out at this point.

1156
02:23:39,859 --> 02:23:49,403
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, this year we decided to do things differently because there had been some things that we felt could be improved upon, one of which was the returning of the choice forms.

1157
02:23:50,464 --> 02:23:53,205
[SPEAKER_09]: Up until this year, parents had options.

1158
02:23:53,325 --> 02:24:00,948
[SPEAKER_09]: They could return them to the school, they could return them to the parent center in person, they could return them to the parent center by mail.

1159
02:24:02,169 --> 02:24:08,071
[SPEAKER_09]: And this led to some confusion because there were deadlines and people felt that they truly had sent it in by the deadline,

1160
02:24:08,539 --> 02:24:09,359
[SPEAKER_09]: but it didn't arrive.

1161
02:24:09,419 --> 02:24:10,360
[SPEAKER_09]: So there were all kinds.

1162
02:24:10,700 --> 02:24:15,582
[SPEAKER_09]: Whenever you have choice of how you do something, there always leaves room for issues.

1163
02:24:15,982 --> 02:24:18,903
[SPEAKER_09]: So we decided to have a process that was uniform.

1164
02:24:19,223 --> 02:24:25,506
[SPEAKER_09]: And we said this year, all forms would be returned to the school where the child was going to school.

1165
02:24:25,906 --> 02:24:29,928
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's worked very well, because we could track all the forms as they came in.

1166
02:24:30,548 --> 02:24:35,970
[SPEAKER_09]: We also wanted parents to have verification that they had actually turned their form in.

1167
02:24:36,440 --> 02:24:42,984
[SPEAKER_09]: So every school, in their own way, gave the parent a number or a form that said that the form was passed.

1168
02:24:43,004 --> 02:24:47,467
[SPEAKER_09]: So nobody could say, gee, I sent it in, but it must have gone somewhere else.

1169
02:24:47,867 --> 02:24:52,130
[SPEAKER_09]: So again, we felt that process, by tightening up that, that was very helpful.

1170
02:24:53,151 --> 02:25:01,716
[SPEAKER_09]: The second thing that we made changes on is that we decided that the open houses, we'd make them more consistent in the presentation.

1171
02:25:02,257 --> 02:25:03,978
[SPEAKER_09]: And Dr. Riccadeli and I, as you know,

1172
02:25:04,908 --> 02:25:12,533
[SPEAKER_09]: And we basically facilitated the presentation for the McGlynn, which was first, and the Andrews, which was second.

1173
02:25:13,234 --> 02:25:18,557
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, we had the principals there, because we don't want them to be hidden, and we had the tours of the buildings.

1174
02:25:19,097 --> 02:25:33,627
[SPEAKER_09]: But we gave a presentation to really emphasize to parents that the education opportunities at both schools were equal, and that students were going to get an education, the same education, curriculum-wise, in either school.

1175
02:25:34,307 --> 02:25:43,071
[SPEAKER_09]: So we felt that was an improvement, and we asked parents to return forms to the schools, their child's elementary school, by April 2nd.

1176
02:25:43,932 --> 02:25:44,312
[SPEAKER_09]: All right?

1177
02:25:45,412 --> 02:25:50,635
[SPEAKER_09]: And then again, we also put in place that there would be choice.

1178
02:25:51,295 --> 02:25:53,216
[SPEAKER_09]: It was almost like two steps to the process.

1179
02:25:53,236 --> 02:26:03,221
[SPEAKER_09]: There would be choice, but if the choice resulted in imbalance, a large imbalance, the committee voted that they would have a partial lottery, so to even out the numbers.

1180
02:26:04,024 --> 02:26:16,009
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, we were hoping that the choice, the numbers would be even, but as you can see from the data that I gave you at the second sheet, they're not.

1181
02:26:16,049 --> 02:26:28,154
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, in reviewing some of the items with special education today with Joan Bowen, we actually have two more students that need to be placed at the Andrews.

1182
02:26:28,254 --> 02:26:30,315
[SPEAKER_09]: So it brings it to a total of

1183
02:26:30,973 --> 02:26:32,814
[SPEAKER_09]: Entering sixth grade is at the Andrews, 176.

1184
02:26:33,234 --> 02:26:36,695
[SPEAKER_09]: Entering students at the McGlynn is 118.

1185
02:26:38,035 --> 02:26:40,256
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're looking to the committee for next steps.

1186
02:26:41,236 --> 02:26:46,038
[SPEAKER_09]: Parents are waiting to hear definitely what school the children will be attending.

1187
02:26:46,578 --> 02:26:49,599
[SPEAKER_09]: And obviously, principals are eager to start scheduling.

1188
02:26:49,639 --> 02:26:53,441
[SPEAKER_09]: And you really can't start the scheduling process until you have numbers.

1189
02:26:54,041 --> 02:26:57,382
[SPEAKER_09]: So again, moving forward, we, again,

1190
02:26:58,105 --> 02:27:01,308
[SPEAKER_09]: need some guidance on how to conduct this partial lottery.

1191
02:27:01,348 --> 02:27:13,517
[SPEAKER_09]: You can see the different schools where the imbalance is the greatest, and we have to go from there, and I think we probably need to give it some thought, but not too long, because people are eager to move forward.

1192
02:27:16,620 --> 02:27:17,580
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Rousseau, sorry.

1193
02:27:19,522 --> 02:27:20,142
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Ms.

1194
02:27:20,162 --> 02:27:22,324
[SPEAKER_11]: Nelson.

1195
02:27:22,865 --> 02:27:25,347
[SPEAKER_11]: Some parents did not submit a form back.

1196
02:27:26,427 --> 02:27:26,888
[SPEAKER_11]: Very few.

1197
02:27:27,819 --> 02:27:36,062
[SPEAKER_11]: Were there efforts to contact those families to make sure that, to find out what their preferences were?

1198
02:27:37,163 --> 02:27:43,105
[SPEAKER_09]: There were very few that didn't return them, and I'm not quite sure what individual principals did.

1199
02:27:43,185 --> 02:27:46,166
[SPEAKER_09]: I can find out, again, it varied from school to school.

1200
02:27:46,747 --> 02:27:54,650
[SPEAKER_09]: But again, what we did is we found that, again, as you can see, that there were some that had no requests and

1201
02:27:56,605 --> 02:28:02,106
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, the programs like the EL students did not have choice because they do have to go to the McGlynn.

1202
02:28:02,146 --> 02:28:03,127
[SPEAKER_09]: So there were things like that.

1203
02:28:03,527 --> 02:28:12,889
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, with Joan Bowen today, we were able to make sure we had the students who needed to be placed in certain special education programs in the appropriate building.

1204
02:28:13,489 --> 02:28:13,589
[SPEAKER_25]: OK.

1205
02:28:13,889 --> 02:28:20,171
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I've spent entirely too many hours on these numbers this weekend.

1206
02:28:20,771 --> 02:28:23,732
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for getting this to us as early as possible.

1207
02:28:24,706 --> 02:28:34,156
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, reviewing this was not really very fun, because the imbalance was so pronounced.

1208
02:28:34,816 --> 02:28:47,849
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just, you know, when I was trying to figure out how we would handle this, other than the fact that we would have to have a partial lottery, you know, I was trying to figure out, like, what are the principles that I feel are important, and, you know, the basic principle that I felt

1209
02:28:48,752 --> 02:28:53,394
[SPEAKER_11]: was the only one that I could stand on was that each school sends half their kids to each middle school.

1210
02:28:54,334 --> 02:29:13,963
[SPEAKER_11]: And because the selection between the schools from the individual elementary schools is very pronounced in a couple of the schools, that means that a couple of the elementary schools will have a much greater amount of getting their non-preferred school.

1211
02:29:14,483 --> 02:29:15,824
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just want to make sure that

1212
02:29:17,284 --> 02:29:24,650
[SPEAKER_11]: We are, so I've never had any doubt that this process is perfectly fair and there's nothing, no shenanigans going on.

1213
02:29:25,111 --> 02:29:40,003
[SPEAKER_11]: But for this year in particular, I really think it's important that when the randomization is happening, that there is at least one school committee member present, that the public is free to show up if they want.

1214
02:29:40,567 --> 02:29:57,050
[SPEAKER_11]: and that this randomization is done live with people present, whether it's recorded or not, because, you know, because it's randomized, you know, they go, you're the brother of that person, that's why you got to go to Andrews or whatever school.

1215
02:29:57,650 --> 02:30:01,591
[SPEAKER_11]: And those things are gonna happen, but not because of that.

1216
02:30:02,051 --> 02:30:09,872
[SPEAKER_11]: And I've never felt that I had concerns that this stuff wasn't being done honestly, but I just feel like

1217
02:30:10,531 --> 02:30:19,235
[SPEAKER_11]: there's no reason we can't shut that down by saying, look, here's the video, you can show it if you want.

1218
02:30:19,255 --> 02:30:30,740
[SPEAKER_11]: I realize there's some planning involved in that, but I just think it's worth it because there's gonna be a lot of unhappy parents, at least, maybe students too.

1219
02:30:31,527 --> 02:30:31,947
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree.

1220
02:30:31,967 --> 02:30:32,828
[SPEAKER_09]: This is not easy.

1221
02:30:33,388 --> 02:30:36,929
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, people have had choice and I think we were, had our fingers crossed.

1222
02:30:37,389 --> 02:30:42,691
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we made it clear to parents, we didn't want to say you have choice and then turn around and do something very different.

1223
02:30:42,711 --> 02:30:48,453
[SPEAKER_09]: We made it clear in the letter that went to them that, you know what, we're going to try the choice method, but it doesn't work.

1224
02:30:48,934 --> 02:30:50,234
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to have to go to something else.

1225
02:30:50,254 --> 02:30:51,495
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think we've warned parents.

1226
02:30:51,875 --> 02:30:57,437
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're not, I would not advise doing something, a third option, but certainly people,

1227
02:30:58,405 --> 02:31:08,733
[SPEAKER_09]: If we had to go to the lottery, people want it to be fair, and I think what you're saying in terms of people seeing that it's a fair process would be the way to go.

1228
02:31:08,833 --> 02:31:18,580
[SPEAKER_09]: But this is the committee's decision, and like I said, I mean, you might want to give it some thought, but people are kind of calling up and saying, when am I gonna know?

1229
02:31:18,781 --> 02:31:21,603
[SPEAKER_09]: And the principals, too, need to begin to schedule buildings.

1230
02:31:22,203 --> 02:31:22,343
[SPEAKER_21]: Ms.

1231
02:31:22,363 --> 02:31:22,864
[SPEAKER_21]: Van de Kloot.

1232
02:31:23,744 --> 02:31:25,646
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just have a couple of thoughts on this.

1233
02:31:28,118 --> 02:31:43,191
[SPEAKER_06]: If, I'm reflecting back on the presentation by our superintendent elect and what Dr. Edward Vincent suggested was that we first appeal to people.

1234
02:31:43,751 --> 02:31:54,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I don't think we can appeal to people and ask them if they might consider moving their child to the McGlynn unless we have.

1235
02:31:57,394 --> 02:32:05,203
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely key and so I would want to see us move on I Understand there might be some negotiations involved.

1236
02:32:05,243 --> 02:32:11,791
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know whether the person who's there is ready to want that position, but I

1237
02:32:13,269 --> 02:32:26,716
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, he's been met with a lot of favoritism, and I think that if it was clear who the principal was, when we did this, it was, oh, there's no principal, while the other schools had a principal.

1238
02:32:26,976 --> 02:32:30,178
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I wouldn't have selected my school if, well,

1239
02:32:31,204 --> 02:32:32,045
[SPEAKER_06]: here there's no principal.

1240
02:32:33,046 --> 02:32:37,329
[SPEAKER_06]: So the first thing we have to do is move on on that appointment.

1241
02:32:37,389 --> 02:32:38,450
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be my number one.

1242
02:32:39,010 --> 02:32:43,514
[SPEAKER_06]: The second is the most obvious and is that we have a group of students.

1243
02:32:43,554 --> 02:32:51,260
[SPEAKER_06]: There's 21 students at the McGlynn and many of their peers already traditionally stay at the McGlynn.

1244
02:32:51,800 --> 02:32:53,101
[SPEAKER_06]: Now maybe not all 21 would go.

1245
02:32:54,309 --> 02:33:05,638
[SPEAKER_06]: But certainly if there is, because of the proximity, that principal who we put into place might be able to make a bond with the kids and family.

1246
02:33:05,738 --> 02:33:16,467
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm just wondering whether it isn't worth putting a little bit of effort into saying it's not going to be quite equal, there'll be some imbalance that we're going to live with this year.

1247
02:33:18,469 --> 02:33:19,970
[SPEAKER_06]: But over time,

1248
02:33:20,610 --> 02:33:22,891
[SPEAKER_06]: And Mr. Martelloni did this very well.

1249
02:33:23,211 --> 02:33:27,433
[SPEAKER_06]: He showed us in his graphs how it had changed.

1250
02:33:27,874 --> 02:33:31,815
[SPEAKER_06]: We put a strong principle into the McGlynn, we're going to see a change.

1251
02:33:33,076 --> 02:33:34,877
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that

1252
02:33:35,547 --> 02:33:43,775
[SPEAKER_06]: And down the road, we might want to do something completely different like Dr. Maurice floated to us as an idea out of the box.

1253
02:33:44,175 --> 02:33:49,501
[SPEAKER_06]: But I definitely think that we should at least send out letters to parents.

1254
02:33:49,521 --> 02:33:50,962
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to put a principle in place.

1255
02:33:51,523 --> 02:33:59,310
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to have, and we need to at least target maybe the McGlynn Elementary students saying, would you be willing?

1256
02:33:59,606 --> 02:34:10,396
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, again, there may be some parents who aren't for particular reasons that their kid needs a change, but then maybe on the other hand, someone's going to be here who the principal is and the rest of the group, and they're going to say, hey, I'd kind of like him for my kid.

1257
02:34:10,416 --> 02:34:11,457
[SPEAKER_06]: He would be a good match.

1258
02:34:12,238 --> 02:34:13,840
[SPEAKER_06]: So that would be my first thought.

1259
02:34:14,500 --> 02:34:15,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Superintendent.

1260
02:34:15,962 --> 02:34:18,044
[SPEAKER_23]: So let me add a couple of other dimensions to this thing.

1261
02:34:18,464 --> 02:34:23,729
[SPEAKER_23]: If you take the next two weeks, remember the principal who we are all talking about a little bit.

1262
02:34:24,601 --> 02:34:26,882
[SPEAKER_23]: who needs to think about it in terms of his own personal needs.

1263
02:34:26,942 --> 02:34:37,106
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, he's obviously a person who has to weigh all his situations, but we've had discussions and, you know, I think over the next several days we'll get an answer, that's one.

1264
02:34:38,446 --> 02:34:44,668
[SPEAKER_23]: Second piece is that, we haven't done the numbers, but I have, is that the class size is at the McGlynn right now.

1265
02:34:45,909 --> 02:34:51,731
[SPEAKER_23]: If you were to go to class size, you're probably like 14, 15 in the class size, whereas at the Andrews, it's closer to 20.

1266
02:34:53,150 --> 02:35:00,952
[SPEAKER_23]: So maybe smaller class size is another attractive feature that's there for some people, not everybody.

1267
02:35:01,953 --> 02:35:13,236
[SPEAKER_23]: And thirdly, you know, if people would like to consider staying there with their friends and they go in a cohort, as Paul mentioned, you know, and have their friends go with them, because we've heard that before, that might do it.

1268
02:35:13,756 --> 02:35:17,957
[SPEAKER_23]: So a suggestion, over the next two weeks, we do what we have to do.

1269
02:35:18,978 --> 02:35:19,978
[SPEAKER_23]: We talk to people.

1270
02:35:20,838 --> 02:35:22,859
[SPEAKER_23]: We go over the principalship.

1271
02:35:23,663 --> 02:35:28,706
[SPEAKER_23]: make a serious effort, but at the end of two weeks, when we come back on the 21st, you gotta act.

1272
02:35:29,446 --> 02:35:31,748
[SPEAKER_23]: You gotta act because we gotta get in the business of doing business.

1273
02:35:31,788 --> 02:35:33,349
[SPEAKER_23]: We have to, you know, there's things to be done.

1274
02:35:33,989 --> 02:35:36,050
[SPEAKER_23]: And sometimes hard decisions have to be made.

1275
02:35:36,470 --> 02:35:39,612
[SPEAKER_23]: Now we don't need a one for one at the schools.

1276
02:35:39,652 --> 02:35:43,174
[SPEAKER_23]: They don't have to be exactly even, but they have to be close enough.

1277
02:35:43,995 --> 02:35:46,436
[SPEAKER_23]: They have to be within 15, 20 kids.

1278
02:35:46,897 --> 02:35:49,198
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, that's a reasonable differential.

1279
02:35:52,834 --> 02:35:53,515
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Ruggiero.

1280
02:35:54,015 --> 02:35:55,096
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just want to make this clear.

1281
02:35:55,136 --> 02:35:57,478
[SPEAKER_10]: Right now, we have a disparity of 29 children.

1282
02:35:57,838 --> 02:35:59,339
[SPEAKER_10]: So if 29 of the 100.

1283
02:36:00,100 --> 02:36:03,843
[SPEAKER_10]: No, 29 of the 176 went to the McGlynn, it would be equal.

1284
02:36:03,883 --> 02:36:05,244
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that correct?

1285
02:36:05,384 --> 02:36:06,104
[SPEAKER_10]: That's my math.

1286
02:36:07,105 --> 02:36:08,326
[SPEAKER_10]: If we were.

1287
02:36:08,346 --> 02:36:11,269
[SPEAKER_09]: Because we subtract 29, add 29.

1288
02:36:11,329 --> 02:36:11,789
[SPEAKER_09]: It works out.

1289
02:36:11,809 --> 02:36:12,089
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.

1290
02:36:12,169 --> 02:36:13,050
[SPEAKER_10]: OK, I'll believe you.

1291
02:36:13,190 --> 02:36:16,853
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm just trying to, once again, trying to get the 15 to 20.

1292
02:36:17,874 --> 02:36:21,817
[SPEAKER_10]: So if we're in a buffer of 15, that would work.

1293
02:36:22,614 --> 02:36:23,835
[SPEAKER_10]: So one school has... Right.

1294
02:36:24,195 --> 02:36:36,004
[SPEAKER_09]: We've also asked Mrs. Greeno to identify the students, the 21 students who opted to go to the Andrews, and perhaps they may reconsider, again, to go back to the McGlynn.

1295
02:36:36,024 --> 02:36:39,446
[SPEAKER_09]: And that would be 21 additional that would move back into the McGlynn.

1296
02:36:39,466 --> 02:36:41,688
[SPEAKER_10]: So we need to convince 14 students, basically.

1297
02:36:44,184 --> 02:36:53,249
[SPEAKER_10]: 14 on the, that would be the most, if we can convince 14 students, are there any incentives that we can offer other than low class size that we can offer to those 14 students?

1298
02:36:53,869 --> 02:36:56,631
[SPEAKER_10]: Like is it possible we could identify the cohorts?

1299
02:36:56,991 --> 02:37:00,933
[SPEAKER_10]: So these are 10 kids that just definitely want to be together, they're buddies.

1300
02:37:01,214 --> 02:37:05,136
[SPEAKER_10]: And so we're gonna make sure that they go over and we can get to our 14.

1301
02:37:06,777 --> 02:37:08,918
[SPEAKER_09]: Well we have a meeting with principals tomorrow.

1302
02:37:08,958 --> 02:37:11,119
[SPEAKER_09]: I know the elementary principals come in with Diane at 9.30.

1303
02:37:12,757 --> 02:37:16,918
[SPEAKER_09]: maybe put something out to them and encourage them maybe to go back.

1304
02:37:16,938 --> 02:37:21,599
[SPEAKER_09]: I do think that the leadership of the school would make a difference.

1305
02:37:21,979 --> 02:37:26,520
[SPEAKER_09]: We have talked to Mr. Tucci, but I have to give him time to make his decisions.

1306
02:37:26,540 --> 02:37:27,660
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a big decision for him.

1307
02:37:28,200 --> 02:37:34,121
[SPEAKER_09]: I think if he were to be appointed, that we'd see an influx of people back in.

1308
02:37:34,581 --> 02:37:36,922
[SPEAKER_09]: But we have to kind of wait that out a little bit.

1309
02:37:38,062 --> 02:37:39,062
[SPEAKER_23]: So, one more thing.

1310
02:37:40,102 --> 02:37:42,303
[SPEAKER_23]: Tonight you saw some teachers come in from Lubbock Line.

1311
02:37:43,863 --> 02:37:47,345
[SPEAKER_23]: As we said before, and as I think we all agree, there's some terrific people there.

1312
02:37:48,066 --> 02:37:56,572
[SPEAKER_23]: It may be that we send a few emissaries over from Glen Middle to talk to some of the elementary school kids, and maybe they can talk about their programs a little bit.

1313
02:37:56,632 --> 02:38:00,434
[SPEAKER_23]: Talk about some of the things they'd like to do, and maybe that's a piece too.

1314
02:38:00,474 --> 02:38:02,496
[SPEAKER_23]: So there's four or five things we can do.

1315
02:38:03,697 --> 02:38:06,899
[SPEAKER_23]: It's not a guarantee, but it's worth a shot.

1316
02:38:08,140 --> 02:38:12,863
[SPEAKER_23]: We just have to be prepared that some people will say no and some people will say yes.

1317
02:38:13,834 --> 02:38:19,300
[SPEAKER_23]: Another issue that we've got to deal with is not specifically this one, but it's an issue, and that's the seventh grade.

1318
02:38:20,561 --> 02:38:29,630
[SPEAKER_23]: You have, you know, emailed me and other people have emailed me ad nauseum, no offense, about a person here and a person there.

1319
02:38:30,511 --> 02:38:33,854
[SPEAKER_23]: There are 12 people who wanted that shift.

1320
02:38:34,475 --> 02:38:37,698
[SPEAKER_23]: If we do it for one, you know, out of turn,

1321
02:38:38,921 --> 02:38:40,884
[SPEAKER_23]: It's going to send some other people unhappy.

1322
02:38:40,984 --> 02:38:41,945
[SPEAKER_23]: So we've got to look at that.

1323
02:38:41,965 --> 02:38:45,229
[SPEAKER_23]: Let's see what the numbers actually present in the seventh grade.

1324
02:38:45,770 --> 02:38:47,932
[SPEAKER_23]: We'll get a better sense of what the seventh grade is like.

1325
02:38:47,972 --> 02:38:51,036
[SPEAKER_23]: Maybe with the new principal, that would be a positive, too.

1326
02:38:51,657 --> 02:38:57,605
[SPEAKER_23]: But before we start taking any one person out of line, I think that's something else we need to be careful about.

1327
02:39:03,909 --> 02:39:08,433
[SPEAKER_10]: My question, so I just want to know when is the deadline we have to decide exactly on the lottery?

1328
02:39:09,333 --> 02:39:13,196
[SPEAKER_23]: I would say the 21st we should be ready to make a decision.

1329
02:39:13,216 --> 02:39:15,918
[SPEAKER_23]: We should, you know, give you an idea towards the end of that week.

1330
02:39:16,298 --> 02:39:16,459
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay.

1331
02:39:16,819 --> 02:39:19,301
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, that it's either happening or it's not happening.

1332
02:39:21,022 --> 02:39:21,662
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Russo.

1333
02:39:23,043 --> 02:39:24,745
[SPEAKER_11]: I would just like to speak to the issue of the 21.

1334
02:39:26,118 --> 02:39:28,579
[SPEAKER_11]: McGlynn Elementary students that have selected the Andrews.

1335
02:39:28,739 --> 02:39:34,721
[SPEAKER_11]: I am actually quite uncomfortable with them even being contacted to see if they would switch.

1336
02:39:35,381 --> 02:39:42,243
[SPEAKER_11]: The goal of 50 percent of the kids from each school is an incredibly important one we should be working towards.

1337
02:39:42,543 --> 02:39:50,665
[SPEAKER_11]: And we should be thankful for the 66 kids that selected the McGlynn for reducing the pressure that we're currently experiencing because

1338
02:39:51,155 --> 02:39:56,680
[SPEAKER_11]: if the McGlynn had done a selection very similar to the other schools, this whole mess would be a much bigger mess.

1339
02:39:57,821 --> 02:40:07,849
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, I'm not really thrilled that there's a greater number of students from the McGlynn that are going to stay in the McGlynn, but I sort of, like, thank them anyways.

1340
02:40:09,150 --> 02:40:12,993
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, the 21 kids

1341
02:40:13,941 --> 02:40:23,207
[SPEAKER_11]: for the McGlynn that have selected the Andrews, to me, are not the families that should be at all looked at for finding more seats.

1342
02:40:25,188 --> 02:40:41,278
[SPEAKER_11]: And at the Columbus, as Mr. Belson alluded to, I know some families at the Columbus who got together, talked to each other, and decided, look, we wanna be together, and if we all select the Andrews, who knows?

1343
02:40:42,230 --> 02:40:59,394
[SPEAKER_11]: and they decided after going to the open houses, look, these schools are both great, and they decided to take the safe bet based on what was going on at the time, and they selected as a group to choose the McGlynn, and they all got the McGlynn, of course, and they're super happy.

1344
02:40:59,814 --> 02:41:10,997
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would just recommend to the families that have selected the Andrews, the Roberts, Columbus, and the Brooks, that if you have even thought about this, talk to your friends,

1345
02:41:14,088 --> 02:41:39,799
[SPEAKER_11]: your kids' friends, which is, you know, and start this conversation right away, and then raise your hand right away so we can get this stuff going earlier, because if we can get the numbers down low enough where we don't even need a lottery, that would be great, but also, wouldn't it be nice if you have a child with four friends who have never been separated since preschool, and you want them to go together to one school,

1346
02:41:40,330 --> 02:41:51,240
[SPEAKER_11]: If you don't decide to go to the McGlynn together and you go into the lottery, one of your children, maybe yours, is going to be going to the McGlynn and the other three are staying at the Andrews.

1347
02:41:51,680 --> 02:41:57,566
[SPEAKER_11]: And yeah, that is awful, but that's not really one of our choices to not do that.

1348
02:41:57,866 --> 02:42:03,311
[SPEAKER_11]: So families need to think about that, really think about that.

1349
02:42:03,331 --> 02:42:03,371
[SPEAKER_22]: Ms.

1350
02:42:03,411 --> 02:42:05,653
[SPEAKER_22]: Nelson, do we know if any PTO meetings are coming up?

1351
02:42:12,672 --> 02:42:23,438
[SPEAKER_09]: But again, we do have the principals in tomorrow morning, and we will bring it up with them, and maybe we can get a little more, but it's like not huge numbers.

1352
02:42:23,478 --> 02:42:29,501
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't have to move 50 kids, 60 kids, but just enough to make it a little more equitable.

1353
02:42:30,382 --> 02:42:30,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

1354
02:42:30,582 --> 02:42:30,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Mustone.

1355
02:42:31,823 --> 02:42:35,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Back in January, when our meeting was in the media studio,

1356
02:42:36,619 --> 02:42:41,101
[SPEAKER_05]: And the McGlynn teachers spoke about their improvement plan.

1357
02:42:41,862 --> 02:42:50,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone mentioned almost, I don't want to call it gifted and talented because that's not what they called it, but it was, does this sound familiar to you?

1358
02:42:51,287 --> 02:43:03,553
[SPEAKER_05]: And they were saying that could be a way to attract that if you spoke to the four elementary school principals and said maybe you could, kids who want to be pushed more, or kids whose parents want to push them more, maybe

1359
02:43:04,017 --> 02:43:06,378
[SPEAKER_05]: it was talked about having a program at the McGlynn.

1360
02:43:06,718 --> 02:43:08,239
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that sound familiar to anyone else?

1361
02:43:08,799 --> 02:43:11,181
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, and we did put clubs in place.

1362
02:43:11,421 --> 02:43:12,421
[SPEAKER_05]: No, this wasn't a club.

1363
02:43:12,461 --> 02:43:16,323
[SPEAKER_05]: This was a curriculum.

1364
02:43:16,383 --> 02:43:19,885
[SPEAKER_05]: They would be tracked, more or less.

1365
02:43:23,807 --> 02:43:25,328
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Benedetto, are you finished?

1366
02:43:25,428 --> 02:43:25,808
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, yeah.

1367
02:43:25,848 --> 02:43:28,409
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm just trying to help clarify.

1368
02:43:29,190 --> 02:43:33,312
[SPEAKER_24]: I believe it was a company that was coming in and offering a specific program.

1369
02:43:33,997 --> 02:43:36,198
[SPEAKER_22]: And that is there.

1370
02:43:36,258 --> 02:43:36,778
[SPEAKER_24]: That is there.

1371
02:43:36,838 --> 02:43:41,200
[SPEAKER_22]: That is at the McGlynn, Mighty, I call it Mighty, Medea.

1372
02:43:42,180 --> 02:43:46,621
[SPEAKER_23]: That's there.

1373
02:43:51,983 --> 02:43:58,946
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Miss Lou did do a club that was a club, but not a separate, but again, the idea was there.

1374
02:44:00,086 --> 02:44:02,607
[SPEAKER_09]: Gifted and talented, full program now,

1375
02:44:03,444 --> 02:44:07,326
[SPEAKER_09]: requires a person who has not licensure but endorsement to do it.

1376
02:44:07,406 --> 02:44:12,009
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's somebody specialized that would have to get that endorsement through DESE.

1377
02:44:12,750 --> 02:44:14,290
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think, I'm pretty sure Ms.

1378
02:44:14,351 --> 02:44:18,233
[SPEAKER_09]: Liu did generate something related to the Odyssey of the Mind this past year.

1379
02:44:18,613 --> 02:44:19,173
[SPEAKER_09]: And we did.

1380
02:44:19,614 --> 02:44:29,119
[SPEAKER_09]: We really thought that a lot of the things that we put in place, like the clubs that everyone had access to, would improve some of this.

1381
02:44:29,179 --> 02:44:30,180
[SPEAKER_09]: But I really

1382
02:44:31,001 --> 02:44:38,455
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it boils down to the unknown leadership, and I think if that is solidified, we may have something happening.

1383
02:44:49,721 --> 02:44:57,987
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's interesting to see this kind of come full circle with me at the end of my school year.

1384
02:44:58,647 --> 02:45:03,370
[SPEAKER_12]: And yeah, I think it does boil down to unknown leadership.

1385
02:45:03,911 --> 02:45:08,774
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's a huge part of it, and the incidents that have happened at the school this year.

1386
02:45:10,496 --> 02:45:15,779
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know earlier in the year, we talked about launching a PR campaign, and not necessarily

1387
02:45:16,935 --> 02:45:23,623
[SPEAKER_12]: diminishing the role of the Andrews, because they've done some amazing work as well, but highlighting the achievements of the McGlynn.

1388
02:45:25,745 --> 02:45:35,176
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think that's super important, and that we should try to use that to attract people back, but we also have to keep in mind the concept of equity.

1389
02:45:35,797 --> 02:45:46,305
[SPEAKER_12]: And we have to make sure that the student populations at both schools are reflective of the community as a whole and not disproportionate towards ELL populations.

1390
02:45:46,565 --> 02:45:51,609
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, that's a separate program, but towards certain populations and certain income groups.

1391
02:45:54,127 --> 02:46:01,119
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, Mr. Russo raised a really interesting idea of doing half and half of different schools, and you know, we need time to explore that option.

1392
02:46:01,539 --> 02:46:06,227
[SPEAKER_12]: But that does ensure, in a more fair way, that we have

1393
02:46:07,367 --> 02:46:14,132
[SPEAKER_12]: a fair representation of different income groups and different racial groups and social groups there at both schools.

1394
02:46:14,793 --> 02:46:21,057
[SPEAKER_12]: So we have to keep in mind that equity is super important in making sure the reputation of our school.

1395
02:46:21,377 --> 02:46:27,202
[SPEAKER_12]: If you have more challenged population in one school, that's going to be reflected in your test scores.

1396
02:46:27,262 --> 02:46:32,365
[SPEAKER_12]: And parents are going to look at that and choose one school over the other.

1397
02:46:32,386 --> 02:46:35,548
[SPEAKER_12]: So we need to make sure that looks fair.

1398
02:46:36,408 --> 02:46:40,309
[SPEAKER_12]: And another good idea is we talked about cohorts.

1399
02:46:40,609 --> 02:46:41,529
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know Ms.

1400
02:46:41,589 --> 02:46:50,131
[SPEAKER_12]: Van der Gloot, at the beginning of the year, talked about how a lot of parents are choosing the injuries because their friends or the friends of their kids are going there.

1401
02:46:50,632 --> 02:46:52,452
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's the reality.

1402
02:46:52,752 --> 02:46:55,433
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, they are going there because of their cohorts.

1403
02:46:57,198 --> 02:47:03,820
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just throwing this out there, and I'm not saying this is a perfect solution by far, but I know Harvard does blocking groups.

1404
02:47:03,980 --> 02:47:11,883
[SPEAKER_12]: They have cohorts sign up together and request a certain dorm together and certain houses together.

1405
02:47:12,103 --> 02:47:19,085
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think maybe exploring something along those lines, making sure that we have equity in our lines.

1406
02:47:20,186 --> 02:47:26,628
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm not saying it's perfect by any means, but looking at the importance of cohorts in distributing your students.

1407
02:47:27,963 --> 02:47:28,043
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1408
02:47:28,823 --> 02:47:29,284
[SPEAKER_21]: Very good.

1409
02:47:29,424 --> 02:47:30,104
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Justin.

1410
02:47:31,265 --> 02:47:31,425
[SPEAKER_21]: Ms.

1411
02:47:31,565 --> 02:47:32,245
[SPEAKER_21]: Mustone.

1412
02:47:32,265 --> 02:47:35,086
[SPEAKER_05]: More suggestion or just to think about.

1413
02:47:35,487 --> 02:47:42,190
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we did move half the ELL students to the Andrews, the numbers would be equal.

1414
02:47:43,971 --> 02:47:48,673
[SPEAKER_09]: The numbers would be equal, but you'd have an issue with staffing.

1415
02:47:48,973 --> 02:47:51,354
[SPEAKER_09]: This is why we consolidated to one school.

1416
02:47:51,594 --> 02:47:53,635
[SPEAKER_09]: There are 36 ELL students.

1417
02:47:54,196 --> 02:47:57,077
[SPEAKER_09]: There are different levels of language proficiency.

1418
02:47:57,585 --> 02:48:01,308
[SPEAKER_09]: you have your newcomers program and they, again, have to be housed together.

1419
02:48:02,609 --> 02:48:16,419
[SPEAKER_09]: Where the McGlynn right now has more space, the new model for the EL, which is something that Mr. Tixera had to do because of CPR, is that we're moving those kids into the regular classes.

1420
02:48:17,059 --> 02:48:20,922
[SPEAKER_09]: And right now, because of the low class size, there's more room to do that at the McGlynn.

1421
02:48:21,322 --> 02:48:25,005
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's all kinds of logistical things, but mostly it's staffing because you'd have to have

1422
02:48:26,265 --> 02:48:29,847
[SPEAKER_09]: more ELL teachers to be over at the school.

1423
02:48:30,027 --> 02:48:33,869
[SPEAKER_05]: So with the Roberts, we had the program grades one through five.

1424
02:48:33,889 --> 02:48:34,690
[SPEAKER_05]: You had the newcomers.

1425
02:48:34,830 --> 02:48:38,432
[SPEAKER_05]: And for a few years, we were maxed on physical space.

1426
02:48:38,912 --> 02:48:43,254
[SPEAKER_05]: So this year, grades one and two went to the Brooks, Roberts retained three, four, and five.

1427
02:48:43,935 --> 02:48:52,699
[SPEAKER_05]: And I haven't heard much feedback one way or the other, but it freed up physical space in our building at the Roberts.

1428
02:48:54,783 --> 02:49:22,585
[SPEAKER_05]: just thinking of the 50 families, well, or 29, who end up not getting what they desired in our school choice, and if you, the Andrews used to have an ELL program, and we had the staffing for it, maybe that's a way to, and Justin, I guess Justin is what made me think of it, is that you don't want the McGlynn to be almost stigmatized, and if the Andrews has it as well, then we're helping there too.

1429
02:49:23,772 --> 02:49:27,474
[SPEAKER_18]: So if I could address the transition of grades one and two over to the Brooks.

1430
02:49:27,995 --> 02:49:29,335
[SPEAKER_18]: That has been very successful.

1431
02:49:29,455 --> 02:49:29,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, good.

1432
02:49:30,056 --> 02:49:31,557
[SPEAKER_18]: The Brooks is doing well.

1433
02:49:31,597 --> 02:49:32,978
[SPEAKER_18]: They love the kiddos over there.

1434
02:49:33,378 --> 02:49:36,340
[SPEAKER_18]: And the Roberts has now a little more space to work with, which is great.

1435
02:49:37,520 --> 02:49:39,922
[SPEAKER_18]: The issue is that's a clean mix.

1436
02:49:39,962 --> 02:49:42,403
[SPEAKER_18]: So you take two teachers and move two teachers.

1437
02:49:42,984 --> 02:49:47,346
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't think it's as clean when they go to middle school because they're a different content area.

1438
02:49:47,386 --> 02:49:50,088
[SPEAKER_18]: So there may be more staffing that they need.

1439
02:49:50,620 --> 02:49:53,021
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, but we're going to get our hands dirty one way or the other.

1440
02:49:53,242 --> 02:49:59,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Either we're going to have 29 really angry families, or we're going to be dirty our hands with staffing with ELL.

1441
02:49:59,245 --> 02:50:05,269
[SPEAKER_18]: But I think one of the good points that Beverly mentioned is that the class size is so small at the McGlynn right now.

1442
02:50:05,789 --> 02:50:12,193
[SPEAKER_18]: With an average class size of 14 and putting more kids in it, that's a great attraction for some families.

1443
02:50:13,414 --> 02:50:18,917
[SPEAKER_18]: But I love Mr. Russo's idea of friends, because that's a huge draw, I think.

1444
02:50:19,520 --> 02:50:25,042
[SPEAKER_18]: So if we were able to get to our families and say to our families, do you want to take the chance of the lottery?

1445
02:50:25,622 --> 02:50:28,183
[SPEAKER_18]: Or do you want your four friends maybe to go together?

1446
02:50:28,223 --> 02:50:29,504
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that's a great idea.

1447
02:50:29,524 --> 02:50:31,665
[SPEAKER_08]: So we might be able to bring that up tomorrow.

1448
02:50:31,725 --> 02:50:32,285
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.

1449
02:50:32,325 --> 02:50:39,148
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think if people knew that the lottery is a reality, because I don't think people believed us, that we would go to step two.

1450
02:50:39,728 --> 02:50:47,451
[SPEAKER_09]: But if we put that out tomorrow, that it is indeed the way we're going to go, unless we have people who volunteer to move groups of kids.

1451
02:50:47,918 --> 02:50:48,899
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll work on that tomorrow.

1452
02:50:48,919 --> 02:50:50,540
[SPEAKER_09]: And that could be the simplest solution.

1453
02:50:50,560 --> 02:50:52,321
[SPEAKER_09]: And hopefully we'll be all done with it.

1454
02:50:52,401 --> 02:50:55,463
[SPEAKER_09]: But we'll keep exploring it.

1455
02:50:55,483 --> 02:50:58,225
[SPEAKER_09]: Paul, did you want to speak about the EL?

1456
02:50:58,345 --> 02:51:00,167
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep, of course you could come up and speak.

1457
02:51:00,187 --> 02:51:01,508
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course.

1458
02:51:01,948 --> 02:51:08,973
[SPEAKER_32]: So just to make it clear, there's also civil rights that are involved regarding the EL program.

1459
02:51:09,774 --> 02:51:15,698
[SPEAKER_32]: For example, you have different levels of students with English proficiency, as was also stated in all the subject areas.

1460
02:51:16,398 --> 02:51:23,676
[SPEAKER_32]: So yes, you can say, OK, we can move two teachers over to the Andrews, but that's not going to make the content.

1461
02:51:24,394 --> 02:51:27,036
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I understand if we have to hire four additional teachers.

1462
02:51:27,476 --> 02:51:41,968
[SPEAKER_32]: I understand that if you don't have the staffing, but we're all just trying to... And we can also take a walk around the Andrews and see what space is available because I can tell you right now, I'm housing every single classroom possible.

1463
02:51:42,688 --> 02:51:46,271
[SPEAKER_32]: So we're going to have to get real creative with spacing as well.

1464
02:51:46,952 --> 02:51:49,494
[SPEAKER_32]: Just something to throw out there as well is when you're thinking...

1465
02:51:50,347 --> 02:51:53,348
[SPEAKER_32]: about doing it, not saying that that's never gonna be the case.

1466
02:51:53,408 --> 02:52:05,091
[SPEAKER_32]: Now, again, we're gonna be talking at the admin meeting, but there's also new accountability rules that are coming out as well, as well as, you know, yeah, equity between the two schools.

1467
02:52:05,752 --> 02:52:09,033
[SPEAKER_32]: If you have four there, you need four, you know, you need four at the other one.

1468
02:52:09,953 --> 02:52:17,095
[SPEAKER_32]: But we also have to make sure the program's working in the right way, making sure that we're covering every student's civil rights as well and getting what they need.

1469
02:52:17,780 --> 02:52:30,791
[SPEAKER_09]: And I believe, you know, Mr. Tixera's not here this evening, but I believe that we, that the superintendent, he did explore that earlier this year, and Mr. Tixera did not recommend it, so we'll have to go back when I see him tomorrow to his thinking on that.

1470
02:52:31,172 --> 02:52:32,953
[SPEAKER_09]: But we'll have the discussion, because we'll all be together.

1471
02:52:35,515 --> 02:52:37,357
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Russo, wanted a follow-up on that?

1472
02:52:37,377 --> 02:52:38,057
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, just one follow-up.

1473
02:52:38,358 --> 02:52:43,342
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just wanted to be clear, you know, that we could send half the kids to each school,

1474
02:52:50,010 --> 02:52:57,011
[SPEAKER_11]: We could have a policy that half of the children from each school will go to each middle school and move no programs.

1475
02:52:59,312 --> 02:53:01,412
[SPEAKER_11]: All ELL students could stay in the McGlynn.

1476
02:53:02,032 --> 02:53:04,233
[SPEAKER_11]: The TLP students could all stay at the Andrews.

1477
02:53:04,673 --> 02:53:06,853
[SPEAKER_11]: We do not, those are not in conflict.

1478
02:53:07,673 --> 02:53:14,574
[SPEAKER_11]: There are sufficient spaces if we decided that half the Brooks kids will go here, half will go there, half the Columbus kids.

1479
02:53:14,794 --> 02:53:17,575
[SPEAKER_11]: There are more than enough spaces to accomplish

1480
02:53:18,227 --> 02:53:25,634
[SPEAKER_11]: keeping the programmatic stuff where it is, and get half the Brooks kids to each school, half the Columbus kids to each school, half the Roberts kids.

1481
02:53:26,374 --> 02:53:37,945
[SPEAKER_11]: We will run into the issue of the McGlynn children that were looking for the K-8 experience, and so we would have to explore how that would work out.

1482
02:53:38,705 --> 02:53:40,046
[SPEAKER_22]: That was one of our options.

1483
02:53:41,224 --> 02:53:52,227
[SPEAKER_22]: But I think at the time we thought we would at least try this one last time so that we could see if voluntarily people would make a commitment and go over to the McGlynn.

1484
02:53:53,167 --> 02:53:57,088
[SPEAKER_22]: Based on everything you heard tonight, there's enough reason to try it.

1485
02:53:57,168 --> 02:54:01,709
[SPEAKER_22]: But I do understand they want to know that the school is in solid hands.

1486
02:54:01,729 --> 02:54:01,929
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1487
02:54:03,890 --> 02:54:12,596
[SPEAKER_22]: There's trust right now, and I think people need to continue that, but hopefully they get that commitment in the very near future, and I think that could sway things.

1488
02:54:13,777 --> 02:54:14,518
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Benedetto.

1489
02:54:14,918 --> 02:54:15,258
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1490
02:54:17,259 --> 02:54:19,721
[SPEAKER_24]: There's a lot of good ideas and a lot of things we need to do.

1491
02:54:19,841 --> 02:54:31,950
[SPEAKER_24]: What we need is what we discussed with our candidates, is a short-term plan for next year, and we need to look at the bigger environment, because other than bodies,

1492
02:54:32,420 --> 02:54:42,407
[SPEAKER_24]: There are a lot of different things that we need to do, but I don't think doing that in May for September is feasible right now, even though I agree with your long-term idea, okay?

1493
02:54:42,587 --> 02:54:51,173
[SPEAKER_24]: Because I think that will handle a lot of the other demographics that need to be addressed, but I don't think we'll have enough time.

1494
02:54:51,674 --> 02:54:52,614
[SPEAKER_24]: I like your idea.

1495
02:54:52,795 --> 02:55:00,280
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't want to target one school to stay there, because I think opening it up, as you suggested, is gonna be,

1496
02:55:01,603 --> 02:55:07,087
[SPEAKER_24]: more productive for our community and not targeting people directly.

1497
02:55:07,227 --> 02:55:16,613
[SPEAKER_24]: And I liked what you said about clinging to people on your microphone and saying, please step up now, because we do need this help.

1498
02:55:16,794 --> 02:55:19,015
[SPEAKER_24]: We don't want to make these decisions for the parents.

1499
02:55:19,335 --> 02:55:25,339
[SPEAKER_24]: We want parents to be a partner with us deciding how to handle this situation that we're in.

1500
02:55:25,900 --> 02:55:27,441
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's all I really have to say.

1501
02:55:29,662 --> 02:55:30,363
[SPEAKER_06]: Just two things.

1502
02:55:30,403 --> 02:55:42,315
[SPEAKER_06]: I think first, part of my thinking about the McGlynn was simply because the hopefully principal elect, I'll say that, was a proximity.

1503
02:55:42,695 --> 02:55:45,238
[SPEAKER_06]: However, clearly it does make more sense for him also.

1504
02:55:46,553 --> 02:55:52,476
[SPEAKER_06]: if he takes the position to reach out to other students and other families, and we might need to figure out a way to do that.

1505
02:55:53,077 --> 02:56:02,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, ultimately, when we made the decision, it was really based on finances and put the groups of ELL students together.

1506
02:56:02,402 --> 02:56:08,886
[SPEAKER_06]: That did disrupt our racial balance plan, which I do have a copy of, and really was the—I mean, when

1507
02:56:09,423 --> 02:56:15,508
[SPEAKER_06]: these schools came out, there was an initial racial balance plan and how we're going to do it and how we select schools.

1508
02:56:16,008 --> 02:56:20,411
[SPEAKER_06]: And it might be beneficial for the committee to just be aware of what that plan is.

1509
02:56:20,451 --> 02:56:23,954
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll talk about that at our next meeting too.

1510
02:56:23,994 --> 02:56:25,435
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll make sure that people get a copy of it.

1511
02:56:27,217 --> 02:56:27,637
[SPEAKER_22]: Very good.

1512
02:56:27,937 --> 02:56:29,358
[SPEAKER_22]: Motion to table this paper?

1513
02:56:29,578 --> 02:56:30,119
[SPEAKER_22]: No, one more.

1514
02:56:30,359 --> 02:56:30,579
[SPEAKER_22]: Ms.

1515
02:56:30,639 --> 02:56:31,080
[SPEAKER_22]: Mostone.

1516
02:56:32,360 --> 02:56:36,683
[SPEAKER_05]: suggested that Mr. Tucci is debating on whether he would like to stay as principal?

1517
02:56:36,783 --> 02:56:43,888
[SPEAKER_09]: We've had conversations, and again, I want to give him the freedom to make a choice.

1518
02:56:44,389 --> 02:56:45,550
[SPEAKER_09]: So we've had conversations.

1519
02:56:45,590 --> 02:56:46,530
[SPEAKER_09]: He's entertaining it.

1520
02:56:46,711 --> 02:56:51,474
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's not like you said, by Friday, so we can tell the public that the McGlynn will have a principal in September.

1521
02:56:51,494 --> 02:56:51,594
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1522
02:56:51,834 --> 02:56:57,679
[SPEAKER_09]: I've asked, I talked to him, I believe it was last week, and I've asked him to take two weeks and think about it.

1523
02:56:58,459 --> 02:57:00,681
[SPEAKER_09]: So we want to make sure that... So the end of next week.

1524
02:57:01,527 --> 02:57:02,207
[SPEAKER_09]: at the end of next week.

1525
02:57:03,228 --> 02:57:05,288
[SPEAKER_09]: So that is the 18th?

1526
02:57:06,049 --> 02:57:07,409
[SPEAKER_09]: It's close, yeah.

1527
02:57:07,429 --> 02:57:07,649
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1528
02:57:08,289 --> 02:57:09,370
[SPEAKER_09]: Or I can talk to him soon.

1529
02:57:10,530 --> 02:57:11,510
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that would be helpful.

1530
02:57:12,791 --> 02:57:13,951
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Regiro.

1531
02:57:14,751 --> 02:57:15,892
[SPEAKER_09]: I will talk to him tomorrow.

1532
02:57:16,732 --> 02:57:17,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, we'll see.

1533
02:57:17,552 --> 02:57:18,693
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Regiro, you all set?

1534
02:57:18,713 --> 02:57:19,233
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

1535
02:57:19,253 --> 02:57:19,513
[SPEAKER_22]: All set?

1536
02:57:20,073 --> 02:57:23,214
[SPEAKER_22]: Is there a motion on the floor to table this paper for two weeks from tonight?

1537
02:57:23,514 --> 02:57:24,695
[SPEAKER_22]: Offered by Mr. Regiro.

1538
02:57:25,992 --> 02:57:26,692
[SPEAKER_22]: Seconded by Ms.

1539
02:57:26,712 --> 02:57:27,352
[SPEAKER_22]: Vander Kloot.

1540
02:57:29,073 --> 02:57:29,833
[SPEAKER_22]: All those in favor?

1541
02:57:30,853 --> 02:57:31,533
[SPEAKER_22]: All those opposed?

1542
02:57:31,593 --> 02:57:32,233
[SPEAKER_22]: Motion passes.

1543
02:57:32,493 --> 02:57:33,293
[SPEAKER_22]: Tabling the paper.

1544
02:57:33,313 --> 02:57:34,254
[SPEAKER_22]: It'll come back two weeks.

1545
02:57:36,414 --> 02:57:36,714
[SPEAKER_22]: Of course.

1546
02:57:40,595 --> 02:57:40,775
[SPEAKER_22]: OK.

1547
02:57:43,875 --> 02:57:50,076
[SPEAKER_22]: Report on trainer issue and MIAA policy related to soccer game at Beverly High School.

1548
02:57:52,537 --> 02:57:53,357
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Superintendent.

1549
02:57:54,477 --> 02:58:06,961
[SPEAKER_23]: So as you remember in the fall, there was a situation in which one of our players got hurt and there was an issue about whether the trainer at Beverly High School properly attended to this individual and what was going on.

1550
02:58:07,041 --> 02:58:23,247
[SPEAKER_23]: So subsequent to that, we've done a number of research items and we've talked about things and I want to read a statement so that the record is clear as to what we think happened and that Mrs. Simonides has some comfort as to her considerations.

1551
02:58:25,411 --> 02:58:35,195
[SPEAKER_23]: This email is intended to provide, or an email at the time, information regarding the soccer injury that occurred during the game at Beverly High School this fall.

1552
02:58:35,995 --> 02:58:45,220
[SPEAKER_23]: Consultation with the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association tells us that the organization considers the situation to be a local matter.

1553
02:58:46,080 --> 02:58:49,362
[SPEAKER_23]: The requirement to provide certified trainers does not cover all sports.

1554
02:58:49,962 --> 02:58:52,363
[SPEAKER_23]: Football and hockey do require a trainer to be present.

1555
02:58:52,770 --> 02:58:53,870
[SPEAKER_23]: but other sports do not.

1556
02:58:54,591 --> 02:58:55,591
[SPEAKER_23]: This includes soccer.

1557
02:58:56,211 --> 02:59:03,975
[SPEAKER_23]: The MIAA suggests that coaches and referees must take responsibility to determine if a player should not re-enter a game after an injury.

1558
02:59:04,535 --> 02:59:07,476
[SPEAKER_23]: The cost for certified trainers at every game would be prohibitive.

1559
02:59:08,436 --> 02:59:16,900
[SPEAKER_23]: As a result, Medford will intensify its training of our coaches and consider hiring an assistant trainer for certain sports to supplement our current staffing.

1560
02:59:17,698 --> 02:59:27,706
[SPEAKER_23]: Coaches will be instructed to exclude any Medford player who suffers a concussion or any other major injury unless the player is properly examined and cleared by a qualified trainer.

1561
02:59:28,567 --> 02:59:35,013
[SPEAKER_23]: Any student who suffers such an injury will require a written follow-up report and a subsequent examination by a qualified physician.

1562
02:59:35,913 --> 02:59:46,242
[SPEAKER_23]: It is also important to note that under MIA rules 56.4, that a trainer, if present, is responsible for both teams when the medical person for the visiting team is not on site.

1563
02:59:47,341 --> 02:59:52,724
[SPEAKER_23]: The Beverly Public Schools has indicated they will not be rehiring their current trainer going forward.

1564
02:59:54,264 --> 02:59:57,586
[SPEAKER_23]: They have advertised for contracted training service for next year.

1565
02:59:58,626 --> 03:00:04,929
[SPEAKER_23]: The Medford Public Schools will initiate a discussion with the Northeast Conference Schools on the issue of appropriate trainer coverage.

1566
03:00:05,990 --> 03:00:12,413
[SPEAKER_23]: I believe that the above steps are a significant response to the issue, and additional steps may emerge after those kinds of discussions.

1567
03:00:13,396 --> 03:00:14,176
[SPEAKER_23]: I'd like to thank Ms.

1568
03:00:14,276 --> 03:00:17,677
[SPEAKER_23]: Simonides for her diligence on this matter.

1569
03:00:18,437 --> 03:00:23,478
[SPEAKER_23]: Our on-field cameras, evidence, and subsequent investigation supports our interpretation of the events at Beverly.

1570
03:00:24,178 --> 03:00:27,079
[SPEAKER_23]: We appreciate her commitment to ensuring safety for student athletes.

1571
03:00:30,579 --> 03:00:31,219
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Russo.

1572
03:00:32,220 --> 03:00:39,081
[SPEAKER_11]: I just really have to, I mean, the MIA's statement about this being cost prohibitive,

1573
03:00:40,433 --> 03:00:51,321
[SPEAKER_11]: This sentence rubs me so terribly, because what it really is saying is the financial cost is acceptable to be borne by the risk to the student's safety.

1574
03:00:52,022 --> 03:00:56,485
[SPEAKER_11]: And those two things, one has risen to be more important, and that is the money.

1575
03:01:02,623 --> 03:01:04,724
[SPEAKER_11]: What is the purpose of MIA?

1576
03:01:05,145 --> 03:01:07,086
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it really not safety?

1577
03:01:07,786 --> 03:01:10,708
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm just really disturbed by that statement.

1578
03:01:12,028 --> 03:01:17,471
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I bet it's cost prohibitive to have them for football.

1579
03:01:17,731 --> 03:01:19,832
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it cheap for football to have trainers?

1580
03:01:20,313 --> 03:01:21,453
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1581
03:01:22,234 --> 03:01:26,556
[SPEAKER_11]: So why is it, in one way, one situation acceptable and the other one not?

1582
03:01:26,596 --> 03:01:31,679
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm just beyond disturbed that that's their excuse for why it's not their problem.

1583
03:01:33,152 --> 03:01:34,053
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just wanted to rant.

1584
03:01:34,234 --> 03:01:34,574
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1585
03:01:35,215 --> 03:01:41,143
[SPEAKER_23]: So I just would say that ultimately it doesn't need a problem because we'd be paying the bill.

1586
03:01:41,524 --> 03:01:43,847
[SPEAKER_23]: See, I think they could say, oh, you've got to have one.

1587
03:01:44,488 --> 03:01:46,631
[SPEAKER_23]: But the reality is, is that how many sports do we have, Bob?

1588
03:01:49,582 --> 03:01:52,846
[SPEAKER_23]: 21 sports, and let's say in every season there's four or five sports.

1589
03:01:52,866 --> 03:01:55,208
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, you'd have to have people at every event.

1590
03:01:55,228 --> 03:01:58,671
[SPEAKER_23]: There's JVs, there's freshmen, there's all kinds of activities.

1591
03:01:59,072 --> 03:01:59,952
[SPEAKER_23]: It would be difficult.

1592
03:02:00,853 --> 03:02:03,556
[SPEAKER_23]: So one way to do it is to differentiate staffing.

1593
03:02:03,576 --> 03:02:11,824
[SPEAKER_23]: We do that with education too in many ways, is to make sure that the people who are on site know enough to respond.

1594
03:02:12,672 --> 03:02:17,335
[SPEAKER_23]: to take youngsters out of games and not just listen to the kids saying, I want to go back in, I want to go back in.

1595
03:02:18,096 --> 03:02:23,159
[SPEAKER_23]: Or to call for medical help and get the youngster to medical help on site.

1596
03:02:24,220 --> 03:02:28,182
[SPEAKER_23]: Some sports are obviously more combative and more physical.

1597
03:02:28,703 --> 03:02:31,064
[SPEAKER_23]: There's a higher likelihood of injury.

1598
03:02:31,605 --> 03:02:34,327
[SPEAKER_23]: So there's a balance wheel here that we can think of.

1599
03:02:34,387 --> 03:02:38,670
[SPEAKER_23]: If we hire another assistant trainer or some of the time for some of the sports, we will have gone a long way.

1600
03:02:39,210 --> 03:02:42,172
[SPEAKER_23]: If we intensify our coaches training,

1601
03:02:42,800 --> 03:02:51,882
[SPEAKER_23]: And we worked with the trainers who from other communities will have gone a long way to at least cover the basics that need to be covered and then move from there.

1602
03:02:52,442 --> 03:02:57,163
[SPEAKER_23]: But I think, you know, if you think about a trainer, a trainer is going to cost us $60,000, $70,000 a piece.

1603
03:02:57,803 --> 03:03:01,944
[SPEAKER_23]: So, you know, it's not like it's a, you know, a small investment.

1604
03:03:02,024 --> 03:03:03,364
[SPEAKER_11]: Just a quick question about this.

1605
03:03:03,584 --> 03:03:08,585
[SPEAKER_11]: So is there no model for communities to work together?

1606
03:03:09,580 --> 03:03:13,642
[SPEAKER_11]: whoever, the conference that we're in, I mean, our soccer players are presumably going to Canada.

1607
03:03:15,764 --> 03:03:17,084
[SPEAKER_11]: We know who we will play.

1608
03:03:18,165 --> 03:03:27,851
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there no model for sharing this particular, I mean, the idea that sometimes teams come together and they both have a trainer at $60,000, $70,000 a year.

1609
03:03:27,871 --> 03:03:29,172
[SPEAKER_11]: That's kind of insane.

1610
03:03:29,832 --> 03:03:33,094
[SPEAKER_11]: And why wouldn't they be sharing resources and schedule?

1611
03:03:33,134 --> 03:03:38,057
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, the schedule for games is not like every morning you wake up and you guess where you're going.

1612
03:03:38,932 --> 03:03:41,733
[SPEAKER_23]: So typically the home team provides the trainer.

1613
03:03:42,313 --> 03:03:46,234
[SPEAKER_23]: But on that day, for example, there were at least three games going on simultaneously.

1614
03:03:46,694 --> 03:03:49,715
[SPEAKER_23]: So trainers on three different fields, moving back and forth.

1615
03:03:50,475 --> 03:04:03,858
[SPEAKER_23]: So, you know, it's obviously a situation where, you know, more is always better, but still, there can be a lot done to mitigate an injury by a person who's watchful.

1616
03:04:05,079 --> 03:04:10,362
[SPEAKER_23]: not putting a youngster back in the game, calling for medical help, doing what they have to do.

1617
03:04:10,722 --> 03:04:11,843
[SPEAKER_23]: We can go a long way with that.

1618
03:04:11,863 --> 03:04:19,328
[SPEAKER_23]: And I think it's very rare that we have a situation that would be totally medical.

1619
03:04:19,348 --> 03:04:20,989
[SPEAKER_23]: Like in football, you have the ambulance on the field.

1620
03:04:21,329 --> 03:04:22,209
[SPEAKER_23]: The ambulance is there.

1621
03:04:22,710 --> 03:04:24,551
[SPEAKER_23]: You know what I mean?

1622
03:04:24,571 --> 03:04:32,696
[SPEAKER_23]: Other sports, it's more of the, let's say, less, let's say, lethal.

1623
03:04:36,074 --> 03:04:37,694
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, you get concussions.

1624
03:04:37,754 --> 03:04:41,435
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, you get concussions and the like, but usually it's not, you know.

1625
03:04:43,556 --> 03:04:45,336
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, it depends on the injury, I guess.

1626
03:04:45,916 --> 03:04:46,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

1627
03:04:46,096 --> 03:04:46,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Kratz.

1628
03:04:47,797 --> 03:04:50,157
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to make sure that Ms.

1629
03:04:50,217 --> 03:04:51,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Simenon has received this report.

1630
03:04:52,038 --> 03:04:52,438
[SPEAKER_03]: She'll get it.

1631
03:04:52,458 --> 03:04:52,818
[SPEAKER_03]: She did?

1632
03:04:52,918 --> 03:04:54,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and I want to- She will get it.

1633
03:04:54,478 --> 03:04:55,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, she will get it, okay.

1634
03:04:55,778 --> 03:04:56,038
[SPEAKER_03]: She did?

1635
03:04:56,258 --> 03:04:56,819
[SPEAKER_23]: Did she already have it?

1636
03:04:56,839 --> 03:04:57,999
[SPEAKER_23]: No, because I gave it to her.

1637
03:04:58,259 --> 03:04:58,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, all right.

1638
03:04:59,099 --> 03:05:03,040
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to make sure, and I just wanted to also thank her very much for her diligence and

1639
03:05:03,460 --> 03:05:05,922
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, communicating all this information to us.

1640
03:05:06,282 --> 03:05:10,865
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a long time and, you know, I'm happy to hear and receive this report tonight.

1641
03:05:11,345 --> 03:05:11,665
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1642
03:05:12,206 --> 03:05:12,786
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Ruggiero?

1643
03:05:13,106 --> 03:05:17,349
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to remind the body that soccer is the leading cause of concussion among women and girls.

1644
03:05:18,250 --> 03:05:21,012
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's also in the top two or three among boys.

1645
03:05:21,392 --> 03:05:24,914
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's a serious concussion risk in soccer.

1646
03:05:24,954 --> 03:05:27,396
[SPEAKER_10]: People don't think it's a contact sport, but it really is.

1647
03:05:27,476 --> 03:05:29,857
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's often caused, I mean, my wife sees it.

1648
03:05:31,718 --> 03:05:36,039
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a motion to place this report on file by Ms.

1649
03:05:36,079 --> 03:05:37,179
[SPEAKER_22]: Mostone, seconded by Ms.

1650
03:05:37,219 --> 03:05:37,659
[SPEAKER_22]: Vandeclude.

1651
03:05:37,679 --> 03:05:38,399
[SPEAKER_22]: All those in favor?

1652
03:05:39,220 --> 03:05:39,760
[SPEAKER_22]: All those opposed?

1653
03:05:39,800 --> 03:05:40,560
[SPEAKER_22]: Motion passes.

1654
03:05:41,300 --> 03:05:43,900
[SPEAKER_22]: Report on partnership with Lesley University.

1655
03:05:47,241 --> 03:05:55,663
[SPEAKER_22]: Over the past several months, the City of Medford School Department primarily and Lesley University, high-ranking officials in Lesley University,

1656
03:05:56,523 --> 03:06:04,207
[SPEAKER_22]: In addition, Bob Maloney, Mark Grumley, it's been kind of a full court press of meetings with this university.

1657
03:06:05,067 --> 03:06:13,592
[SPEAKER_22]: What brought them to Medford was a desperate need for some athletic space, predominantly the wood floor.

1658
03:06:13,912 --> 03:06:15,613
[SPEAKER_22]: They would like a wood floor at the high school.

1659
03:06:16,430 --> 03:06:17,690
[SPEAKER_22]: and also tennis courts.

1660
03:06:18,431 --> 03:06:24,893
[SPEAKER_22]: That's what brought them to Medford, but once they were in Medford, we realized how much more they can offer to this community.

1661
03:06:25,913 --> 03:06:34,897
[SPEAKER_22]: I've been meeting with several organizations that try to train coaches and school systems in how to deal with trauma.

1662
03:06:35,397 --> 03:06:38,578
[SPEAKER_22]: Leslie's training people to do that type of work.

1663
03:06:39,338 --> 03:06:42,880
[SPEAKER_22]: So they have students that will be looking for internships and co-ops

1664
03:06:44,800 --> 03:06:53,986
[SPEAKER_22]: to learn in the field how to be great teachers, how to be great... It's getting late.

1665
03:06:54,487 --> 03:06:56,788
[SPEAKER_22]: How to be social workers, et cetera.

1666
03:06:57,549 --> 03:07:01,171
[SPEAKER_22]: So we think it's a great idea to move forward with Lesley University.

1667
03:07:01,871 --> 03:07:07,935
[SPEAKER_22]: The one contractual item would be for the use of the courts in the cages at Medford High School.

1668
03:07:08,936 --> 03:07:11,397
[SPEAKER_22]: NCAA requires they be wood floors.

1669
03:07:11,477 --> 03:07:13,519
[SPEAKER_22]: We do not obviously have wood floors right now.

1670
03:07:14,379 --> 03:07:22,844
[SPEAKER_22]: So they would be making an investment in our cages to put in state-of-the-art wood floors, also the scoring mechanism.

1671
03:07:22,864 --> 03:07:25,085
[SPEAKER_22]: What other things in the cages?

1672
03:07:25,205 --> 03:07:27,646
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, they'll be cleaning it up, they'll be painting, they'll be doing lighting.

1673
03:07:27,666 --> 03:07:36,071
[SPEAKER_22]: Painting, cleaning it, lighting, plus paying us a fee every year to basically rent the space through this partnership.

1674
03:07:36,831 --> 03:07:39,273
[SPEAKER_22]: Duggar would go through the city side of things.

1675
03:07:39,353 --> 03:07:41,594
[SPEAKER_22]: Right now they have a permit to use Duggar Park.

1676
03:07:42,173 --> 03:07:45,957
[SPEAKER_22]: for their tennis courts, but they also would like to have a commitment going forward.

1677
03:07:46,377 --> 03:07:53,564
[SPEAKER_22]: So we will be working with them on an agreement, and likewise, they will be making improvements to the tennis courts, which our high school team plays on.

1678
03:07:53,604 --> 03:07:54,545
[SPEAKER_22]: That's their home courts.

1679
03:07:55,225 --> 03:07:57,227
[SPEAKER_22]: So we look at it as a win-win opportunity.

1680
03:07:58,088 --> 03:07:58,408
[SPEAKER_22]: We think

1681
03:07:59,928 --> 03:08:10,432
[SPEAKER_22]: We wanted to speak to the school committee about it to get your thoughts, but we think it's really something very positive for the school system and to have that partnership with Lesley University for our students as well.

1682
03:08:11,372 --> 03:08:16,675
[SPEAKER_22]: Hopefully it'll be a matriculation opportunity and we're just very excited about it.

1683
03:08:17,915 --> 03:08:18,675
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Superintendent.

1684
03:08:18,935 --> 03:08:23,017
[SPEAKER_23]: So one of the things that we've talked a lot about is inclusive education.

1685
03:08:23,677 --> 03:08:26,458
[SPEAKER_23]: Lesley has a center for inclusive education.

1686
03:08:27,099 --> 03:08:27,799
[SPEAKER_23]: Lesley has

1687
03:08:28,345 --> 03:08:33,547
[SPEAKER_23]: specializations for the kinds of things that we have been talking about over and over again.

1688
03:08:34,208 --> 03:08:42,852
[SPEAKER_23]: They've got specializations for social and emotional learning and trauma and things that we can't have the expertise locally.

1689
03:08:42,872 --> 03:08:45,633
[SPEAKER_23]: It's just too extensive, but we can work that out.

1690
03:08:47,514 --> 03:08:50,915
[SPEAKER_23]: President of Lesley College actively participated in this.

1691
03:08:50,955 --> 03:08:52,436
[SPEAKER_23]: This is not low level.

1692
03:08:53,377 --> 03:08:56,318
[SPEAKER_23]: And we think that their proximity to us,

1693
03:08:57,357 --> 03:09:06,883
[SPEAKER_23]: and the type of programs that they specialize in, the type of university they are, because universities have specializations, is a great fit for what we're doing.

1694
03:09:07,624 --> 03:09:18,911
[SPEAKER_23]: It also provides us opportunities for professional development for our teachers, professional development for other staff members, and it provides possible some opportunities for adult learning as well.

1695
03:09:19,551 --> 03:09:24,435
[SPEAKER_23]: So there's this tremendous potential here that will be cost effective,

1696
03:09:25,437 --> 03:09:30,679
[SPEAKER_23]: and that will not interfere with our otherwise operations and will help us upgrade our facilities.

1697
03:09:31,239 --> 03:09:32,080
[SPEAKER_23]: This is a win-win.

1698
03:09:32,800 --> 03:09:41,303
[SPEAKER_23]: So we've got to move forward because I don't think we're going to get this opportunity again because they're going to try to find something else if they can't work with us and they've got a short window.

1699
03:09:42,164 --> 03:09:45,385
[SPEAKER_23]: And we just want to, we just think it's something we should be supporting.

1700
03:09:46,706 --> 03:09:47,506
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Benedetto.

1701
03:09:47,726 --> 03:09:55,149
[SPEAKER_24]: First of all, the mayor has said that she's been working on this for months and this is the first that this body is hearing of this proposal.

1702
03:09:55,502 --> 03:10:00,730
[SPEAKER_24]: There is such a lack of information given to us this night.

1703
03:10:01,851 --> 03:10:03,654
[SPEAKER_24]: When will they be using our facilities?

1704
03:10:03,734 --> 03:10:05,417
[SPEAKER_24]: How much money will they be providing?

1705
03:10:05,497 --> 03:10:07,680
[SPEAKER_24]: How many courses will our teachers get to take?

1706
03:10:08,057 --> 03:10:12,320
[SPEAKER_24]: This one-page thing does not tell me anything about this program.

1707
03:10:12,640 --> 03:10:17,983
[SPEAKER_24]: And if we need to act quickly, then maybe we should have heard about it before the middle of May.

1708
03:10:18,844 --> 03:10:20,905
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry, but I'm really not happy.

1709
03:10:21,025 --> 03:10:23,507
[SPEAKER_24]: And we're trying to talk about security.

1710
03:10:23,867 --> 03:10:25,188
[SPEAKER_24]: Is this for their games?

1711
03:10:25,328 --> 03:10:28,209
[SPEAKER_24]: Is there going to be spectators in our school gyms?

1712
03:10:28,370 --> 03:10:30,011
[SPEAKER_24]: When will they be played?

1713
03:10:30,091 --> 03:10:31,972
[SPEAKER_24]: How is security going to be handled?

1714
03:10:32,232 --> 03:10:33,893
[SPEAKER_24]: This is a big commitment.

1715
03:10:33,953 --> 03:10:37,015
[SPEAKER_24]: This isn't a one-pager at the end of a night

1716
03:10:37,515 --> 03:10:50,486
[SPEAKER_24]: So I would like to table this discussion until we have more information from the district so that we can review a lot more questions and not have this brought before us in this manner at this late time of the evening.

1717
03:10:50,686 --> 03:10:50,926
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1718
03:10:50,946 --> 03:10:52,508
[SPEAKER_22]: Will you withdraw your tabling just so Ms.

1719
03:10:52,568 --> 03:10:53,989
[SPEAKER_22]: Vianna Klug could make a comment?

1720
03:10:54,009 --> 03:10:54,049
[SPEAKER_24]: No.

1721
03:10:57,011 --> 03:10:57,792
[SPEAKER_24]: I said no.

1722
03:10:59,854 --> 03:11:01,015
[SPEAKER_22]: Tabling is undebatable.

1723
03:11:02,216 --> 03:11:03,637
[SPEAKER_22]: On the motion to table the paper.

1724
03:11:03,657 --> 03:11:04,438
[SPEAKER_22]: All those in favor?

1725
03:11:06,971 --> 03:11:07,992
[SPEAKER_22]: The chair is in doubt.

1726
03:11:09,674 --> 03:11:10,455
[SPEAKER_22]: The chair is in doubt.

1727
03:11:10,495 --> 03:11:11,416
[SPEAKER_22]: Roll call, please, Ms.

1728
03:11:11,456 --> 03:11:11,836
[SPEAKER_22]: Kretz.

1729
03:11:15,860 --> 03:11:16,140
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

1730
03:11:25,650 --> 03:11:27,712
[SPEAKER_22]: This is a motion to table the paper.

1731
03:11:27,752 --> 03:11:28,453
[SPEAKER_22]: It's undebatable.

1732
03:11:33,463 --> 03:11:34,864
[SPEAKER_22]: We can't talk about it right now.

1733
03:11:35,084 --> 03:11:39,568
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, if she withdrew it or if it fails, we can talk about it and we can still retable it at the end.

1734
03:11:39,988 --> 03:11:40,228
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1735
03:11:40,508 --> 03:11:40,769
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1736
03:11:48,834 --> 03:11:49,094
[SPEAKER_22]: No, no.

1737
03:11:59,228 --> 03:12:03,190
[SPEAKER_22]: No, two in the affirmative, five in the negative, motion fails.

1738
03:12:04,350 --> 03:12:04,490
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

1739
03:12:04,590 --> 03:12:04,970
[SPEAKER_22]: Vander Kloot.

1740
03:12:05,611 --> 03:12:08,372
[SPEAKER_06]: So because I think there are a lot of questions surrounding this.

1741
03:12:08,392 --> 03:12:09,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, there should be.

1742
03:12:09,232 --> 03:12:11,073
[SPEAKER_06]: And we definitely need more information.

1743
03:12:11,913 --> 03:12:18,116
[SPEAKER_06]: I would move the paper to a committee of the whole so that we can discuss it as soon as possible.

1744
03:12:20,957 --> 03:12:21,117
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

1745
03:12:21,157 --> 03:12:21,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Mustone.

1746
03:12:22,098 --> 03:12:23,278
[SPEAKER_22]: Division three, yes.

1747
03:12:23,378 --> 03:12:24,399
[SPEAKER_05]: Division three tennis.

1748
03:12:24,779 --> 03:12:25,259
[SPEAKER_22]: Division three.

1749
03:12:25,279 --> 03:12:25,959
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other sports?

1750
03:12:27,955 --> 03:12:30,639
[SPEAKER_22]: do have all the sports, but that's predominantly what we're talking about.

1751
03:12:32,000 --> 03:12:34,924
[SPEAKER_22]: Really, we're talking basketball and cages.

1752
03:12:40,330 --> 03:12:47,813
[SPEAKER_06]: very much want to make sure to have an understanding of the impact on our student usage at the same time.

1753
03:12:49,153 --> 03:12:50,674
[SPEAKER_06]: And security, obviously.

1754
03:12:50,734 --> 03:12:53,215
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously is a priority.

1755
03:12:53,375 --> 03:13:00,558
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a thing about the windows in the gym, and man, if they would replace the windows.

1756
03:13:01,598 --> 03:13:02,298
[SPEAKER_22]: The cow wall?

1757
03:13:06,642 --> 03:13:06,862
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course.

1758
03:13:06,882 --> 03:13:07,562
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, yes.

1759
03:13:07,782 --> 03:13:08,003
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

1760
03:13:08,563 --> 03:13:12,204
[SPEAKER_22]: On the motion that the paper be referred to Committee of the Whole, authored by Ms.

1761
03:13:12,224 --> 03:13:13,865
[SPEAKER_22]: Vander Kloot, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

1762
03:13:13,885 --> 03:13:14,665
[SPEAKER_22]: All those in favor?

1763
03:13:15,246 --> 03:13:15,346
[SPEAKER_22]: Aye.

1764
03:13:15,466 --> 03:13:16,126
[SPEAKER_22]: All those opposed?

1765
03:13:16,186 --> 03:13:16,806
[SPEAKER_22]: Motion passes.

1766
03:13:17,046 --> 03:13:17,406
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1767
03:13:24,669 --> 03:13:27,030
[SPEAKER_22]: Report on ALICE program feedback.

1768
03:13:30,152 --> 03:13:30,412
[SPEAKER_22]: Good evening.

1769
03:13:30,432 --> 03:13:30,792
[SPEAKER_22]: Good evening.

1770
03:13:49,781 --> 03:13:50,102
[SPEAKER_18]: Staff?

1771
03:13:51,580 --> 03:13:57,044
[SPEAKER_18]: And the first question is, what are some of the key points learned about ALICE in the presentation?

1772
03:13:57,465 --> 03:14:00,807
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm just going to go through a few of the points that I thought were pertinent.

1773
03:14:01,708 --> 03:14:06,492
[SPEAKER_18]: And one was that teachers have options in crisis situation using ALICE.

1774
03:14:07,332 --> 03:14:12,076
[SPEAKER_18]: It puts students in a safe place, and then they are to alert authorities.

1775
03:14:12,896 --> 03:14:15,799
[SPEAKER_18]: They can learn developmentally appropriate responses.

1776
03:14:15,819 --> 03:14:17,220
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think that was important for me.

1777
03:14:18,329 --> 03:14:24,677
[SPEAKER_18]: with my pre-K to grade 5 hat to make sure that we're appropriate developmentally with our children.

1778
03:14:24,698 --> 03:14:32,468
[SPEAKER_18]: And what I thought was very interesting was that you call police instead of 911 and you would get a quicker response.

1779
03:14:33,450 --> 03:14:38,094
[SPEAKER_18]: The second question that was asked was, what do you believe are some of the benefits of ALICE?

1780
03:14:38,775 --> 03:14:51,286
[SPEAKER_18]: And our staff said the options for safety, different solutions for various age groups, alerting staff with common language, which I think is very important, and they felt it was a proactive approach.

1781
03:14:54,132 --> 03:14:57,393
[SPEAKER_18]: What concerns do you have about implementing ALICE in the district?

1782
03:14:58,093 --> 03:15:08,637
[SPEAKER_18]: One of the main concerns was the cost with our staff, the timeline for approval and for training, reservations at the elementary level, and the raised level of anxiety for students.

1783
03:15:09,137 --> 03:15:13,759
[SPEAKER_18]: Once again, I was very passionate about that, because I worry about the little ones.

1784
03:15:15,119 --> 03:15:23,022
[SPEAKER_18]: The timetable moving forward, we don't want to scare or frighten our children, and we need a lot of parent input on this.

1785
03:15:24,213 --> 03:15:32,816
[SPEAKER_18]: And the last question that we asked was, please list suggestions or statements for future district trainings related to school safety and security.

1786
03:15:33,737 --> 03:15:38,138
[SPEAKER_18]: And our teachers said security is up to date and the training is effective.

1787
03:15:38,698 --> 03:15:46,701
[SPEAKER_18]: The meetings on communication, what to do if, additional school resource offices is something that teachers would like to see.

1788
03:15:48,862 --> 03:15:50,683
[SPEAKER_18]: All drills should be taken seriously.

1789
03:15:51,548 --> 03:15:58,671
[SPEAKER_18]: we need to create potential preventative measures and look at the mental health of our students as well.

1790
03:15:59,632 --> 03:16:03,133
[SPEAKER_18]: So interestingly enough, I've been in touch with Tewksbury Public Schools.

1791
03:16:03,793 --> 03:16:11,417
[SPEAKER_18]: They are going to have a training or a drill, a real drill, excuse me, end of the night, can't talk anymore.

1792
03:16:13,240 --> 03:16:14,421
[SPEAKER_18]: on May 18th.

1793
03:16:14,461 --> 03:16:22,384
[SPEAKER_18]: So I would like to take a team of teachers and maybe some administrators over to one of the schools in Tewksbury.

1794
03:16:22,804 --> 03:16:31,428
[SPEAKER_18]: Shannon Demos, who's one of our assistant principals, is from Tewksbury and she's setting this up for me for a 5-6 drill and for a 7-8 drill.

1795
03:16:32,328 --> 03:16:41,772
[SPEAKER_18]: And unfortunately, the K-4 was done in November, so there's no opportunity to see the little ones, but that is something that I'm looking forward to doing on May 18th.

1796
03:16:44,358 --> 03:16:45,118
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Russo.

1797
03:16:46,099 --> 03:16:46,759
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

1798
03:16:46,779 --> 03:16:48,260
[SPEAKER_11]: You're welcome.

1799
03:16:48,280 --> 03:16:52,342
[SPEAKER_11]: There was one thing on this report that sort of jumped out at me.

1800
03:16:53,943 --> 03:17:02,448
[SPEAKER_11]: In all conversations around ALICE that I have heard from the community and from proponents of ALICE, it was, why isn't Medford doing it?

1801
03:17:02,608 --> 03:17:04,209
[SPEAKER_11]: Literally everybody does it.

1802
03:17:05,289 --> 03:17:08,731
[SPEAKER_11]: And to see 100, I mean, are there more than 100 schools in Massachusetts?

1803
03:17:08,771 --> 03:17:11,793
[SPEAKER_11]: I think there's a lot more than 100 schools in Massachusetts.

1804
03:17:12,284 --> 03:17:17,627
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just think that the hyperbole of we're the only ones not doing it needs to be called out.

1805
03:17:18,428 --> 03:17:20,549
[SPEAKER_11]: Because it really angered me when I read this.

1806
03:17:21,590 --> 03:17:26,293
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought we were literally the only ones not doing it.

1807
03:17:26,393 --> 03:17:32,297
[SPEAKER_11]: The drills twice a year, I mean, if we're going to do it, then we've got to really do it.

1808
03:17:32,777 --> 03:17:39,721
[SPEAKER_11]: And how many more drills can we put our kids through when they're all doing MCAS all the time, too?

1809
03:17:42,754 --> 03:17:47,037
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, the other issue I have, oh, can you invite me on the 18th in case?

1810
03:17:47,697 --> 03:17:48,437
[SPEAKER_18]: Absolutely.

1811
03:17:48,638 --> 03:17:53,300
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, we have a quorum, but I actually am available, so I would like to go.

1812
03:17:54,341 --> 03:17:54,661
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all.

1813
03:17:54,941 --> 03:17:55,282
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1814
03:17:55,302 --> 03:17:55,742
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd like that.

1815
03:17:57,223 --> 03:17:57,403
[SPEAKER_21]: Ms.

1816
03:17:57,423 --> 03:17:58,363
[SPEAKER_21]: Van de Kloot.

1817
03:17:58,984 --> 03:18:05,908
[SPEAKER_06]: Going forward with this, if that's what we ought to do, I mean, I would really, this is something where I really would like to have the superintendent-elect involved.

1818
03:18:06,341 --> 03:18:12,243
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they've done by something that part of the discussion is I think they've done Alice in Boston.

1819
03:18:12,303 --> 03:18:20,106
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and so I just, you know, I, I think it will be, I'm very glad you're going out.

1820
03:18:20,747 --> 03:18:25,989
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that if we if the new superintendent elect has had

1821
03:18:27,363 --> 03:18:37,348
[SPEAKER_06]: some experience with this, that we want to certainly be talking to her right now about this specific item, and wish that you would bring it up, and experience and whatnot.

1822
03:18:37,688 --> 03:18:54,157
[SPEAKER_06]: I will say, Doctor, I'm sorry, at the Fisk School in Lexington, Mr. Martelone, just, they were doing it, and you know, I hope that he would at least be willing to still have a conversation with us.

1823
03:18:54,877 --> 03:18:56,218
[SPEAKER_06]: He just might be very useful in

1824
03:18:57,641 --> 03:18:58,622
[SPEAKER_06]: saying how it goes.

1825
03:18:58,802 --> 03:19:06,047
[SPEAKER_06]: I do know a teacher who's out there, and I certainly will pursue that to have a conversation with them, but if we could reach out to him as well.

1826
03:19:06,768 --> 03:19:07,128
[SPEAKER_22]: Very good.

1827
03:19:07,308 --> 03:19:07,689
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1828
03:19:08,709 --> 03:19:09,030
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1829
03:19:10,571 --> 03:19:15,535
[SPEAKER_22]: Motion to receive this report and place it on file by Mr. Giro, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

1830
03:19:15,555 --> 03:19:16,315
[SPEAKER_22]: All those in favor?

1831
03:19:16,335 --> 03:19:16,395
[SPEAKER_22]: Aye.

1832
03:19:17,156 --> 03:19:17,816
[SPEAKER_22]: All those opposed?

1833
03:19:18,157 --> 03:19:18,917
[SPEAKER_22]: Motion passes.

1834
03:19:19,798 --> 03:19:22,120
[SPEAKER_22]: Pre-budget report mathematics.

1835
03:19:28,155 --> 03:19:29,596
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you so much for your patience.

1836
03:19:32,378 --> 03:19:34,440
[SPEAKER_14]: No problem at all.

1837
03:19:34,560 --> 03:19:35,560
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, everyone.

1838
03:19:35,641 --> 03:19:39,944
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll be brief and just go through my overview.

1839
03:19:40,044 --> 03:19:42,225
[SPEAKER_14]: I think everybody has the full report.

1840
03:19:42,946 --> 03:19:44,807
[SPEAKER_14]: This is the pre-budget report.

1841
03:19:45,448 --> 03:19:54,915
[SPEAKER_14]: And our program in mathematics, again, is based on the Massachusetts State Framework for Mathematics, which was revised in March of 2017.

1842
03:19:56,913 --> 03:20:05,540
[SPEAKER_14]: So I've been in the process of revising all our curriculum documents, elementary report cards, and all to reflect the changes.

1843
03:20:06,040 --> 03:20:13,085
[SPEAKER_14]: Some were cosmetic, but there was a few standard shifts in our K through 12 program.

1844
03:20:14,767 --> 03:20:22,793
[SPEAKER_14]: And our practices are aligned with our program materials at all levels.

1845
03:20:23,561 --> 03:20:34,966
[SPEAKER_14]: At the middle school, we have 13 mathematics teachers, and at the high school, 15 instructional teachers all have their math licenses.

1846
03:20:35,786 --> 03:20:40,268
[SPEAKER_14]: And the highlights of the school is, like I said, the curriculum revision.

1847
03:20:40,868 --> 03:20:44,729
[SPEAKER_14]: The middle school is still reviewing programs.

1848
03:20:45,750 --> 03:20:50,992
[SPEAKER_14]: They have some pilots that they feel very strongly about that they want to continue for another year.

1849
03:20:51,572 --> 03:20:53,473
[SPEAKER_14]: because changes have been made.

1850
03:20:54,233 --> 03:21:12,040
[SPEAKER_14]: Some program materials they just received in April as new additions, so they want to be very responsive to the needs of the students, yet on the other hand, they want to be responsible fiscally, so this is a big dollar amount.

1851
03:21:12,380 --> 03:21:17,082
[SPEAKER_14]: So all the teachers have the new materials in the classrooms.

1852
03:21:17,562 --> 03:21:20,743
[SPEAKER_14]: We're trying to do an even split on two of the pilots,

1853
03:21:21,150 --> 03:21:30,335
[SPEAKER_14]: and they're also looking at an online program that's available that is highly rated nationally.

1854
03:21:31,596 --> 03:21:47,464
[SPEAKER_14]: We're in our second year of implementation of the new program for Algebra I, Geometry, and Algebra II at the high school, and all students participate in this, our English learners, our special education students, and things are going well.

1855
03:21:47,524 --> 03:21:49,425
[SPEAKER_14]: There's quite a bit of collaboration

1856
03:21:49,948 --> 03:21:51,249
[SPEAKER_14]: amongst the faculty.

1857
03:21:52,330 --> 03:21:53,391
[SPEAKER_14]: It's very healthy.

1858
03:21:53,831 --> 03:21:56,574
[SPEAKER_14]: They work on common assessments.

1859
03:21:56,694 --> 03:21:58,375
[SPEAKER_14]: They talk about pacing.

1860
03:21:59,136 --> 03:22:04,700
[SPEAKER_14]: So our students are really benefiting from their collaboration.

1861
03:22:05,641 --> 03:22:10,726
[SPEAKER_14]: The professional development this year, again, focused in best practices.

1862
03:22:11,686 --> 03:22:18,312
[SPEAKER_14]: One initiative that we've just started, which will go into the next school year, is on math protocols.

1863
03:22:18,815 --> 03:22:23,719
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's a partnership between the mathematics department and special educators.

1864
03:22:24,119 --> 03:22:25,220
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is K through 12.

1865
03:22:26,621 --> 03:22:32,906
[SPEAKER_14]: And learning different procedures and protocols for teaching mathematics that will benefit all students.

1866
03:22:33,307 --> 03:22:36,069
[SPEAKER_14]: So we just finished a train the trainers.

1867
03:22:36,209 --> 03:22:37,710
[SPEAKER_14]: We did a leadership training.

1868
03:22:38,551 --> 03:22:43,775
[SPEAKER_14]: They will be doing a planning meeting in June or late May.

1869
03:22:45,457 --> 03:22:46,898
[SPEAKER_14]: We're still looking at some dates.

1870
03:22:47,535 --> 03:22:51,498
[SPEAKER_14]: and how to roll it out to the entire K-12 faculty.

1871
03:22:52,799 --> 03:23:08,691
[SPEAKER_14]: In addition to that, at the elementary level, we had our professional development focused on the standards for mathematical practice, so what it actually looks like in the classroom, and the rigor and such.

1872
03:23:11,493 --> 03:23:15,556
[SPEAKER_14]: And at the middle and high school, we're going back and

1873
03:23:16,450 --> 03:23:20,674
[SPEAKER_14]: taking a look at what was working for us pre-Common Core.

1874
03:23:21,374 --> 03:23:23,476
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was, we wrote a lot.

1875
03:23:23,876 --> 03:23:26,218
[SPEAKER_14]: We used manipulatives.

1876
03:23:27,159 --> 03:23:36,847
[SPEAKER_14]: So kind of stepping back a little bit from virtual manipulatives and knowing that with the diversity in our population, sometimes it's best to do hands-on.

1877
03:23:37,228 --> 03:23:43,333
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're focusing on that and in writing and mathematics to increase achievement.

1878
03:23:43,747 --> 03:23:52,474
[SPEAKER_14]: The teachers, some of them are using this as their student learning goal, and they are showing improvement in their students.

1879
03:23:52,514 --> 03:23:55,456
[SPEAKER_14]: They're documenting and collecting data on that.

1880
03:23:57,578 --> 03:24:02,502
[SPEAKER_14]: We, so as I said, we have an integration of students.

1881
03:24:03,042 --> 03:24:11,589
[SPEAKER_14]: At the high school, it's the vocational technical students or the high school students are taking the same math courses together

1882
03:24:12,083 --> 03:24:15,165
[SPEAKER_14]: especially the algebra one and geometry.

1883
03:24:15,705 --> 03:24:26,593
[SPEAKER_14]: And when the vocational students are more academic program, they're able to filter in in some of the other courses because they don't do the week on week off.

1884
03:24:27,313 --> 03:24:29,454
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's easier to promote that.

1885
03:24:30,175 --> 03:24:35,618
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we have good integration of EL students now at the high school.

1886
03:24:36,019 --> 03:24:37,840
[SPEAKER_14]: It's really mostly newcomers.

1887
03:24:38,301 --> 03:24:50,753
[SPEAKER_14]: that have a substantially separate classroom, but that teacher collaborates with the teachers in the department, and the classroom is with and among the other math teachers.

1888
03:24:52,013 --> 03:24:56,656
[SPEAKER_14]: The, let me see, I'm going through this quickly for you.

1889
03:24:57,076 --> 03:25:00,198
[SPEAKER_14]: A collaboration outreach is very strong.

1890
03:25:01,599 --> 03:25:19,509
[SPEAKER_14]: Really, one thing that's most noteworthy is that just crossed my desk this week was we have seven students who will be going to MIT this summer for, I'd say, a program with Lincoln Labs, no cost at all to the families.

1891
03:25:20,103 --> 03:25:32,145
[SPEAKER_14]: So the students, what they've done is they've, in partnership with their program, they are taking online courses and programming.

1892
03:25:32,685 --> 03:25:38,606
[SPEAKER_14]: In the background, we have people at MIT who are watching their progress.

1893
03:25:39,106 --> 03:25:44,347
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the students are invited into the summer program if they're successful.

1894
03:25:44,707 --> 03:25:47,928
[SPEAKER_14]: So we've been very successful to have seven students

1895
03:25:48,409 --> 03:25:52,953
[SPEAKER_14]: invited in, and I believe six are definite to go.

1896
03:25:53,013 --> 03:26:01,421
[SPEAKER_14]: We're still waiting on one, because these are mostly sophomores and juniors, and some of them need to work during the summer.

1897
03:26:01,941 --> 03:26:06,325
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's kind of the trade-off, but it's a great experience.

1898
03:26:06,965 --> 03:26:09,187
[SPEAKER_14]: MIT had approached me last year.

1899
03:26:09,408 --> 03:26:14,292
[SPEAKER_14]: Last year we had four students accepted, so it's great this year that we have seven.

1900
03:26:15,044 --> 03:26:19,947
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's a national program, so students are coming from all over the country to participate.

1901
03:26:19,967 --> 03:26:21,188
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is a great one.

1902
03:26:22,589 --> 03:26:25,931
[SPEAKER_14]: Tufts University continues to be a good partner.

1903
03:26:26,331 --> 03:26:28,612
[SPEAKER_14]: So they come whenever we call.

1904
03:26:29,773 --> 03:26:34,736
[SPEAKER_14]: We have an intern in the department, and we had one previous year.

1905
03:26:35,156 --> 03:26:42,421
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we also have speakers come in, and a nice relationship there with the computer science department.

1906
03:26:43,699 --> 03:26:55,985
[SPEAKER_14]: Wentworth Institute, they come in and they've talked to the high school students in the area of applied math, and that's for all levels of students, but mostly juniors.

1907
03:26:56,045 --> 03:27:00,967
[SPEAKER_14]: They want them to start thinking about where they're going to be going to school the next years.

1908
03:27:01,568 --> 03:27:04,329
[SPEAKER_14]: We have a partnership with Harvard University.

1909
03:27:04,889 --> 03:27:12,033
[SPEAKER_14]: It's an Algebra I project, and it is two years, so next year will be the second year of our

1910
03:27:13,095 --> 03:27:17,718
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have teachers at the middle and the high school level who are involved with that.

1911
03:27:17,879 --> 03:27:23,303
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's learning different strategies to teach algebra one.

1912
03:27:24,644 --> 03:27:30,828
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, MIDE has been wonderful to us.

1913
03:27:30,968 --> 03:27:41,316
[SPEAKER_14]: Their program at the McGlynn Middle School is to help strengthen students' application of engineering and in that,

1914
03:27:42,139 --> 03:27:45,040
[SPEAKER_14]: with science and mathematics.

1915
03:27:45,460 --> 03:27:54,024
[SPEAKER_14]: So the students are seeing what they're learning in those content areas, then moves into the engineering.

1916
03:27:54,384 --> 03:27:59,806
[SPEAKER_14]: They have been great partners for our robotics team, our BOPL team.

1917
03:27:59,886 --> 03:28:02,987
[SPEAKER_14]: They fully fund their participation.

1918
03:28:03,607 --> 03:28:07,849
[SPEAKER_14]: This year, Medford came in fourth in the double elimination.

1919
03:28:09,205 --> 03:28:12,086
[SPEAKER_14]: and the other teams were quite strong.

1920
03:28:12,546 --> 03:28:21,588
[SPEAKER_14]: They have that, usually their schools have a course where we just have the course in our vocational technical school.

1921
03:28:22,489 --> 03:28:29,451
[SPEAKER_14]: The students who participate come from both schools, but they do this after school as a club.

1922
03:28:29,471 --> 03:28:32,511
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're really proud of what they've done this year.

1923
03:28:33,512 --> 03:28:38,433
[SPEAKER_14]: And we've tried to increase our participation with the parents and

1924
03:28:39,582 --> 03:28:43,123
[SPEAKER_14]: bring them more into the classroom to see what the mathematics is about.

1925
03:28:43,503 --> 03:28:57,645
[SPEAKER_14]: So we had early in the year, we opened up elementary classrooms in every school and parents and guardians were able to go through and kind of experience a typical math class.

1926
03:28:58,306 --> 03:29:01,906
[SPEAKER_14]: And we did that also at the high school level for the first time this year.

1927
03:29:02,346 --> 03:29:05,387
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was very well received by parents that came away.

1928
03:29:06,055 --> 03:29:07,636
[SPEAKER_14]: learning a little bit of the math.

1929
03:29:07,816 --> 03:29:13,280
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think all of those who were able to come down and attend, I know it meant a lot to the teachers.

1930
03:29:14,600 --> 03:29:15,841
[SPEAKER_14]: And like I said, this is new.

1931
03:29:16,682 --> 03:29:19,383
[SPEAKER_14]: They hope to be able to do more again.

1932
03:29:19,483 --> 03:29:22,445
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just that everybody's schedule is so tight.

1933
03:29:23,206 --> 03:29:27,829
[SPEAKER_14]: There's so many things going on in the city that people have to choose.

1934
03:29:28,789 --> 03:29:31,431
[SPEAKER_14]: And so that's kind of in

1935
03:29:32,165 --> 03:29:34,567
[SPEAKER_14]: in a nutshell, some of the things that we've been doing.

1936
03:29:35,927 --> 03:29:38,829
[SPEAKER_14]: Use of our funding from last year.

1937
03:29:39,570 --> 03:29:54,540
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, we were paying for our textbook adoption at the high school level, the instructional program materials, and that goes K through 12, but primarily middle and high school.

1938
03:29:56,161 --> 03:29:56,841
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the

1939
03:29:58,699 --> 03:30:02,762
[SPEAKER_14]: allotment for the office supplies is for departmental purposes.

1940
03:30:03,803 --> 03:30:14,010
[SPEAKER_14]: So how the budget requests differ this year to next year is more on the area of personnel.

1941
03:30:14,890 --> 03:30:24,297
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm requesting that we put in place a math teacher and a math lab at the McGlynn Middle School.

1942
03:30:24,357 --> 03:30:25,878
[SPEAKER_14]: We have that at the Andrews.

1943
03:30:26,382 --> 03:30:28,624
[SPEAKER_14]: but it does not exist at the McGlynn.

1944
03:30:28,884 --> 03:30:46,459
[SPEAKER_14]: So we would like to have a licensed teacher put in place there and, um, you know, to help with the math program, um, do some intervention and, uh, just kind of help moving students along before, you know, they get too far behind.

1945
03:30:47,120 --> 03:30:50,943
[SPEAKER_14]: So we'd like you to consider funding a position there.

1946
03:30:51,545 --> 03:30:53,786
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'd like to put out a strong call.

1947
03:30:53,846 --> 03:30:55,427
[SPEAKER_14]: I ask for this every year.

1948
03:30:56,028 --> 03:31:01,351
[SPEAKER_14]: But there is a need for math coaches in the elementary schools.

1949
03:31:01,991 --> 03:31:07,235
[SPEAKER_14]: But if we had one in every building, they could serve more purposes.

1950
03:31:08,575 --> 03:31:11,177
[SPEAKER_14]: We need data specialists.

1951
03:31:11,197 --> 03:31:16,120
[SPEAKER_14]: And they could help the principals take a look at data, examine the data.

1952
03:31:17,721 --> 03:31:20,643
[SPEAKER_14]: And then they can also help with the intervention.

1953
03:31:21,279 --> 03:31:30,606
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, identify those students, prescribe what's needed for them, and if their schedule allows, actually work with the students.

1954
03:31:33,528 --> 03:31:36,350
[SPEAKER_14]: That's something that I would like you to think about.

1955
03:31:37,171 --> 03:31:43,815
[SPEAKER_14]: Those items are very costly because it comes with salary, benefits, and everything else.

1956
03:31:43,875 --> 03:31:44,895
[SPEAKER_14]: We're aware of it.

1957
03:31:45,416 --> 03:31:53,441
[SPEAKER_14]: But every year, we look at scores and everyone's wondering, you know, how are the students doing on MCAS?

1958
03:31:53,941 --> 03:32:01,226
[SPEAKER_14]: And math comes up, but we have to realize that there are some supports that are needed and, you know,

1959
03:32:02,275 --> 03:32:13,381
[SPEAKER_14]: I think when you talk to the new superintendent, they'll be familiar with the role of math coaches in Boston schools and then our surrounding location.

1960
03:32:13,882 --> 03:32:17,264
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think those would help move us along.

1961
03:32:17,804 --> 03:32:21,586
[SPEAKER_14]: So the textbooks budget is the same as last year.

1962
03:32:21,606 --> 03:32:25,268
[SPEAKER_14]: We still owe one payment on the high school.

1963
03:32:26,829 --> 03:32:31,532
[SPEAKER_14]: Instructional materials could stay the same, even if we added the personnel

1964
03:32:32,250 --> 03:32:40,996
[SPEAKER_14]: I should be able to get some of the materials for those people out of the instructional piece and the office supplies.

1965
03:32:41,976 --> 03:32:43,177
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you have any questions.

1966
03:32:44,518 --> 03:32:45,939
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Russo's first, then Ms.

1967
03:32:45,959 --> 03:32:46,359
[SPEAKER_22]: Vander Kloot.

1968
03:32:47,360 --> 03:32:48,040
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

1969
03:32:49,461 --> 03:32:57,406
[SPEAKER_11]: So other than the data analysis, what is a math coach doing?

1970
03:32:59,042 --> 03:33:07,626
[SPEAKER_14]: So the math coach goes into the classroom, makes observations of what the needs might be.

1971
03:33:07,646 --> 03:33:16,869
[SPEAKER_14]: So actually looks at teacher's practices and how the students are responding to the practices in the classroom and sits and coaches.

1972
03:33:17,129 --> 03:33:24,452
[SPEAKER_14]: So then they find a common planning time where they sit and they meet and improve upon the teacher's practice.

1973
03:33:24,873 --> 03:33:28,114
[SPEAKER_14]: Sometimes the coach will actually teach the lesson.

1974
03:33:28,705 --> 03:33:31,207
[SPEAKER_14]: and show this is what a model lesson looks like.

1975
03:33:31,587 --> 03:33:45,356
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's a very close dance that they do together, and that's the primary role of the math coach, is to improve teacher performance, which again, will improve the student performance.

1976
03:33:46,157 --> 03:33:46,657
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1977
03:33:46,677 --> 03:33:46,817
[SPEAKER_14]: Mm-hmm.

1978
03:33:47,418 --> 03:33:48,098
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1979
03:33:48,118 --> 03:33:48,158
[SPEAKER_22]: Ms.

1980
03:33:48,198 --> 03:33:49,319
[SPEAKER_22]: Van de Kloot.

1981
03:33:49,339 --> 03:33:54,722
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to ask whether the collaboration with Midday is expected to continue next year?

1982
03:33:55,763 --> 03:33:58,525
[SPEAKER_14]: That is our hopes that we will continue it,

1983
03:33:59,582 --> 03:34:01,303
[SPEAKER_14]: We started small.

1984
03:34:01,463 --> 03:34:04,043
[SPEAKER_14]: They didn't know how many engineers that have available.

1985
03:34:04,063 --> 03:34:07,764
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's been a big success story all around.

1986
03:34:07,804 --> 03:34:16,886
[SPEAKER_14]: They've been welcomed, as you heard earlier this evening, by the teachers and found a good fit for those classes.

1987
03:34:17,387 --> 03:34:23,188
[SPEAKER_14]: So those conversations and how to schedule, then we can bring in the principal.

1988
03:34:23,847 --> 03:34:24,808
[SPEAKER_14]: and do the scheduling.

1989
03:34:25,269 --> 03:34:36,579
[SPEAKER_06]: I just think that that's such a strong addition right now, and that's something that we should be marketing, if you would, to prospective students of saying, hey, you know, and I've seen

1990
03:34:36,978 --> 03:34:38,878
[SPEAKER_06]: photographs I was over at Midea one day.

1991
03:34:38,959 --> 03:34:43,240
[SPEAKER_06]: I've talked extensively to them and they see it as a positive, a win-win.

1992
03:34:44,100 --> 03:34:46,160
[SPEAKER_06]: Their engineers are having a great time with the kids.

1993
03:34:46,701 --> 03:34:50,782
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just, I think that many parents don't know that it exists.

1994
03:34:51,262 --> 03:34:53,282
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would like us to see that.

1995
03:34:53,622 --> 03:34:59,724
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd also like to thank you for all of your years of work with the Medford Public Schools and leading the department.

1996
03:35:01,393 --> 03:35:09,518
[SPEAKER_06]: can say that you're on the retirement list and I'm sure that must be a little bittersweet, but I just want to make sure that I take a moment to thank you.

1997
03:35:10,418 --> 03:35:10,879
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1998
03:35:11,019 --> 03:35:19,764
[SPEAKER_14]: It's been quite a journey because I came in when accountability started in MCAS and standards.

1999
03:35:19,844 --> 03:35:24,687
[SPEAKER_14]: It's been nine years in this particular position, leadership position.

2000
03:35:25,574 --> 03:35:28,537
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we were with the superintendents.

2001
03:35:29,698 --> 03:35:34,141
[SPEAKER_14]: We put together that science lab that we're all used and love.

2002
03:35:34,241 --> 03:35:39,025
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, that was a lot of work, several years and many hours.

2003
03:35:39,045 --> 03:35:41,548
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, we let that happen.

2004
03:35:41,948 --> 03:35:51,856
[SPEAKER_14]: And now we're going into the next iteration of, you know, what are the needs and actually, um, moving things forward and, you know, getting new programs in place.

2005
03:35:52,517 --> 03:35:53,738
[SPEAKER_14]: All those things take time.

2006
03:35:54,468 --> 03:35:59,109
[SPEAKER_14]: But I've enjoyed it, that keeps you going.

2007
03:35:59,489 --> 03:36:03,990
[SPEAKER_14]: Listening to everything that's happening, it's like, oh, do I really want to leave?

2008
03:36:04,110 --> 03:36:08,011
[SPEAKER_14]: But I told my family, yes, it's time.

2009
03:36:08,972 --> 03:36:09,432
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2010
03:36:09,452 --> 03:36:10,212
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2011
03:36:11,552 --> 03:36:12,192
[SPEAKER_22]: I realize that.

2012
03:36:12,252 --> 03:36:13,073
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Benedetto.

2013
03:36:13,193 --> 03:36:13,553
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2014
03:36:13,993 --> 03:36:16,333
[SPEAKER_24]: I also want to thank you for all your years of service.

2015
03:36:16,373 --> 03:36:17,674
[SPEAKER_24]: You were my daughter's teacher.

2016
03:36:18,114 --> 03:36:18,734
[SPEAKER_21]: My daughter's too.

2017
03:36:19,054 --> 03:36:19,954
[SPEAKER_21]: In AP.

2018
03:36:21,194 --> 03:36:23,175
[SPEAKER_24]: And you were very tough.

2019
03:36:24,185 --> 03:36:24,865
[SPEAKER_24]: Very fair.

2020
03:36:25,245 --> 03:36:31,067
[SPEAKER_24]: They learned a tremendous amount that they carried forward with them, not only to college, but in their life.

2021
03:36:32,128 --> 03:36:34,108
[SPEAKER_24]: I appreciate that as a parent.

2022
03:36:34,989 --> 03:36:40,550
[SPEAKER_24]: And as an administrator, you have always been very receptive to the committee and any questions.

2023
03:36:41,411 --> 03:36:44,732
[SPEAKER_24]: And thank you for all your years of service to the community.

2024
03:36:45,092 --> 03:36:45,472
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2025
03:36:46,072 --> 03:36:47,132
[SPEAKER_24]: It's been a privilege.

2026
03:36:47,713 --> 03:36:48,353
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Ruggiero.

2027
03:36:49,360 --> 03:36:51,101
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you once again for your service.

2028
03:36:51,901 --> 03:36:52,822
[SPEAKER_10]: I just had a quick question.

2029
03:36:53,182 --> 03:36:58,824
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we participate in the American Math Competition, the AMC 8s, AMC 10s, AMC 12s?

2030
03:37:00,105 --> 03:37:06,068
[SPEAKER_14]: We have math teams, but they're not in that particular competition.

2031
03:37:06,528 --> 03:37:09,849
[SPEAKER_14]: But we do have a math team at the high school.

2032
03:37:10,169 --> 03:37:12,450
[SPEAKER_14]: We sort of have a varsity and junior varsity.

2033
03:37:13,031 --> 03:37:17,853
[SPEAKER_14]: And so they don't do the face-to-face competition.

2034
03:37:18,607 --> 03:37:22,490
[SPEAKER_14]: they test and they just send in their scores.

2035
03:37:22,930 --> 03:37:24,511
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, the AMCAs are just tests.

2036
03:37:25,312 --> 03:37:31,837
[SPEAKER_14]: And with that, we encourage all students to participate.

2037
03:37:32,477 --> 03:37:36,640
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's not so much about winning and getting the highest scores.

2038
03:37:36,740 --> 03:37:41,804
[SPEAKER_14]: It's about being part of something and extending their learning.

2039
03:37:42,424 --> 03:37:46,067
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we do that in the middle school, the eighth grade AMCs?

2040
03:37:47,678 --> 03:37:51,781
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't believe, it's not through my office if it's done.

2041
03:37:51,801 --> 03:37:53,902
[SPEAKER_14]: It could be done as a club.

2042
03:37:55,203 --> 03:37:56,384
[SPEAKER_14]: I can check on that for you.

2043
03:37:56,704 --> 03:37:57,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, thank you.

2044
03:37:57,685 --> 03:37:58,025
[SPEAKER_05]: You're welcome.

2045
03:37:58,505 --> 03:37:58,925
[SPEAKER_22]: Very good.

2046
03:37:58,945 --> 03:37:59,826
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

2047
03:38:00,887 --> 03:38:03,508
[SPEAKER_22]: Motion to accept this report and place it on file.

2048
03:38:04,429 --> 03:38:05,830
[SPEAKER_22]: Seconded by Mr. Azzurro.

2049
03:38:05,870 --> 03:38:06,570
[SPEAKER_22]: All those in favor?

2050
03:38:06,590 --> 03:38:06,650
[SPEAKER_22]: Aye.

2051
03:38:07,511 --> 03:38:08,191
[SPEAKER_22]: All those opposed?

2052
03:38:08,231 --> 03:38:08,992
[SPEAKER_22]: Motion passes.

2053
03:38:10,032 --> 03:38:13,715
[SPEAKER_22]: We also have the pre-budget report on physical education.

2054
03:38:18,009 --> 03:38:18,289
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

2055
03:38:19,070 --> 03:38:23,212
[SPEAKER_22]: Recommendation to accept gift from the, I'm sorry, J.S.

2056
03:38:23,332 --> 03:38:24,233
[SPEAKER_22]: Limb Foundation.

2057
03:38:25,514 --> 03:38:32,058
[SPEAKER_14]: So, um, I would like to read this so that it's part of publicizing, um, the award.

2058
03:38:32,458 --> 03:38:33,299
[SPEAKER_14]: The J.S.

2059
03:38:33,439 --> 03:38:43,525
[SPEAKER_14]: Limb Foundation has generously offered a gift of $3,000 to Medford High School to encourage students to engage in rigorous mathematics and science studies.

2060
03:38:44,180 --> 03:38:48,604
[SPEAKER_14]: The gift recognizes students for academic excellence in these subjects.

2061
03:38:49,604 --> 03:38:58,151
[SPEAKER_14]: Acceptance of the gift requires announcement to the sophomores in the spring of 2018 to promote awareness.

2062
03:38:58,772 --> 03:39:08,320
[SPEAKER_14]: Two prizes of $1,000 each are presented to juniors who demonstrate top performance in mathematics and science for the 2018-2019 school year.

2063
03:39:11,997 --> 03:39:20,622
[SPEAKER_14]: An additional $1,000 is designated for administrative costs at the discretion of the awarding committees and headmaster.

2064
03:39:21,222 --> 03:39:27,046
[SPEAKER_14]: The mathematics awarding committee will consist of the director and teachers of the mathematics department.

2065
03:39:27,426 --> 03:39:33,309
[SPEAKER_14]: The science awarding committee will consist of the director and teachers of the science department.

2066
03:39:33,850 --> 03:39:37,592
[SPEAKER_14]: Criteria and selection will meet with the headmaster's approval.

2067
03:39:38,699 --> 03:39:45,723
[SPEAKER_14]: And this foundation was established in 2010 by MIT professor J.S.

2068
03:39:45,883 --> 03:39:46,204
[SPEAKER_14]: Lim.

2069
03:39:47,144 --> 03:39:49,205
[SPEAKER_14]: It's located in Winchester, Mass.

2070
03:39:49,686 --> 03:39:58,651
[SPEAKER_14]: The foundation expresses that in a global marketplace, mathematics and science skills are critical for the next generation of American professionals.

2071
03:39:59,191 --> 03:40:01,813
[SPEAKER_14]: One of our missions is to help U.S.

2072
03:40:01,873 --> 03:40:07,036
[SPEAKER_14]: students reach their fullest potential in these subjects through grants to schools

2073
03:40:07,566 --> 03:40:09,587
[SPEAKER_14]: and educational organizations.

2074
03:40:10,488 --> 03:40:17,652
[SPEAKER_14]: In the process, we hope that our initiatives inspire others to make contributions in their communities.

2075
03:40:18,253 --> 03:40:34,223
[SPEAKER_14]: This is the second year that the foundation awarded this gift to Mefford High School, and the first awarding of prizes to members of the junior class will take place on Thursday, May 17th, at the academic awards evening at Mefford High School.

2076
03:40:35,129 --> 03:40:35,609
[SPEAKER_24]: Excellent.

2077
03:40:35,990 --> 03:40:36,830
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Benedetto.

2078
03:40:37,631 --> 03:40:39,332
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion to accept this award.

2079
03:40:39,452 --> 03:40:41,093
[SPEAKER_24]: I always want to take in money.

2080
03:40:42,714 --> 03:40:46,197
[SPEAKER_24]: And thank, could we send a letter of thanks to the foundation?

2081
03:40:46,217 --> 03:40:47,037
[SPEAKER_24]: Absolutely.

2082
03:40:47,078 --> 03:40:53,422
[SPEAKER_24]: As well as invite the junior class members to our next meeting that will be receiving these awards.

2083
03:40:54,823 --> 03:40:56,284
[SPEAKER_24]: Just so we can honor them as well.

2084
03:40:57,425 --> 03:41:04,470
[SPEAKER_22]: And the first awarding of prizes will be held on May 17th at the annual academic award evening at Medford High School.

2085
03:41:05,553 --> 03:41:09,615
[SPEAKER_22]: There's a motion on the floor for approval of this gift, seconded by Ms.

2086
03:41:09,675 --> 03:41:10,335
[SPEAKER_22]: Van de Kloot.

2087
03:41:10,355 --> 03:41:11,396
[SPEAKER_22]: Roll call vote, please, Ms.

2088
03:41:11,416 --> 03:41:11,716
[SPEAKER_22]: Kretz.

2089
03:41:13,297 --> 03:41:13,557
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

2090
03:41:22,500 --> 03:41:24,381
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

2091
03:41:24,421 --> 03:41:27,002
[SPEAKER_22]: Motion passes, and we'll also send out a thank you letter.

2092
03:41:27,303 --> 03:41:27,883
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Ms.

2093
03:41:27,923 --> 03:41:29,203
[SPEAKER_22]: Joy, for your years of service.

2094
03:41:29,243 --> 03:41:29,704
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

2095
03:41:29,924 --> 03:41:30,264
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

2096
03:41:32,690 --> 03:41:36,353
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, report on pre-budget presentation, health and physical education.

2097
03:41:39,075 --> 03:41:39,535
[SPEAKER_22]: Good evening.

2098
03:41:39,895 --> 03:41:42,817
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening, Mayor Burke, Superintendent Belson, members of the school committee.

2099
03:41:42,837 --> 03:41:44,518
[SPEAKER_15]: It's been a long night for everyone.

2100
03:41:44,578 --> 03:41:45,879
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll be as brief as possible.

2101
03:41:46,860 --> 03:41:51,123
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just going to go over a few of our accomplishments and then what we're looking for going into next year.

2102
03:41:52,504 --> 03:41:55,726
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the things we got this year was the Youth Opioid Prevention Grant.

2103
03:41:56,047 --> 03:41:56,387
[SPEAKER_15]: That was for $18,000.

2104
03:41:57,007 --> 03:42:02,251
[SPEAKER_15]: And what we did with some of that money is we purchased Michigan Model,

2105
03:42:02,701 --> 03:42:04,722
[SPEAKER_15]: kits for every elementary teacher.

2106
03:42:04,742 --> 03:42:08,383
[SPEAKER_15]: So every elementary teacher at all four elementary schools have their own kit.

2107
03:42:08,803 --> 03:42:12,725
[SPEAKER_15]: So they are teaching the social-emotional learning unit in grades K-5.

2108
03:42:14,365 --> 03:42:25,630
[SPEAKER_15]: We also received the USA Field Hockey grant for all four elementary schools where we were provided curriculum and field hockey equipment to each school, and field hockey was actually added into our curriculum there.

2109
03:42:26,030 --> 03:42:31,252
[SPEAKER_15]: We've also added it at the middle schools, hopefully to gain a little bit more interest in that sport.

2110
03:42:32,480 --> 03:42:40,603
[SPEAKER_15]: We also received the Game Change grant through the New England Patriots, and that was a $3,000 grant, and that's an anti-violence grant.

2111
03:42:41,123 --> 03:42:50,306
[SPEAKER_15]: We had people from Game Change come in and train about 25 high school students, and they actually brought that down to the middle school students as well.

2112
03:42:50,886 --> 03:43:00,769
[SPEAKER_15]: We've also incorporated some of those lessons into our freshman health curriculum, so within the past two years, so all of our freshmen, all of our sophomores have been trained in it as well.

2113
03:43:01,265 --> 03:43:05,026
[SPEAKER_15]: And we'll continue to bring that down to the health classes at the middle school as well.

2114
03:43:06,726 --> 03:43:12,627
[SPEAKER_15]: We also have introduced lifeguard training course as a physical education elective at the high school.

2115
03:43:12,947 --> 03:43:17,408
[SPEAKER_15]: That was in our course selection catalog for this year.

2116
03:43:17,468 --> 03:43:24,110
[SPEAKER_15]: So next year, students will be able to take that as a physical education elective and get certified right through that class.

2117
03:43:26,438 --> 03:43:31,261
[SPEAKER_15]: The last thing, we've added yoga units to the K to 8 physical education curriculum.

2118
03:43:32,982 --> 03:43:35,984
[SPEAKER_15]: So I've done one training with my staff.

2119
03:43:36,004 --> 03:43:37,505
[SPEAKER_15]: We're doing another one next week.

2120
03:43:38,426 --> 03:43:39,027
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's K to 8.

2121
03:43:39,527 --> 03:43:40,628
[SPEAKER_15]: We already have it at the high school.

2122
03:43:40,648 --> 03:43:42,509
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a yoga 1 and a yoga 2 class.

2123
03:43:44,651 --> 03:43:54,818
[SPEAKER_15]: Looking forward to next year, I'm looking for level funding for travel, office supplies, textbooks, educational supplies, maintenance of equipment, and for fitness center supervision.

2124
03:43:56,081 --> 03:44:00,382
[SPEAKER_15]: What we are looking for is to increase staffing by two positions.

2125
03:44:01,083 --> 03:44:02,823
[SPEAKER_15]: I have asked for these positions in the past.

2126
03:44:03,203 --> 03:44:07,545
[SPEAKER_15]: Last year I asked for two health teachers at the middle school where we got one.

2127
03:44:07,985 --> 03:44:19,208
[SPEAKER_15]: We're looking for one more so that we have one full time at each school, which will help us with scheduling and making sure that all of our students are getting the Michigan model in 6th, 7th, and 8th grade.

2128
03:44:20,649 --> 03:44:24,510
[SPEAKER_15]: The next piece we're looking for is increase in physical education staffing.

2129
03:44:24,951 --> 03:44:27,312
[SPEAKER_15]: for an adaptive physical education teacher.

2130
03:44:28,473 --> 03:44:30,614
[SPEAKER_15]: And this is not to take away from inclusion.

2131
03:44:30,634 --> 03:44:32,255
[SPEAKER_15]: We're still including our students.

2132
03:44:32,515 --> 03:44:44,001
[SPEAKER_15]: But this is in addition to help maybe a push-in or co-teaching model where we have that adaptive teacher that can go into classes to help our physical education teachers with students that might need extra help.

2133
03:44:46,183 --> 03:44:47,203
[SPEAKER_15]: Does anyone have any questions?

2134
03:44:47,223 --> 03:44:47,443
[SPEAKER_22]: Excellent.

2135
03:44:47,463 --> 03:44:48,344
[SPEAKER_22]: Are there any questions?

2136
03:44:48,724 --> 03:44:49,324
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Russo.

2137
03:44:51,265 --> 03:44:53,987
[SPEAKER_11]: I was a little surprised by, thank you, by the way, for the report.

2138
03:44:54,868 --> 03:45:16,778
[SPEAKER_11]: I was surprised to see that the Brooks and the McGlynn only have one full-time PE teacher, and then the Columbus has one and a half, even though the Columbus has like a hundred and something students fewer than the Brooks, and even more fewer, if that's a thing, than the McGlynn.

2139
03:45:18,679 --> 03:45:20,540
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a history?

2140
03:45:20,820 --> 03:45:22,501
[SPEAKER_11]: Why is this situation this way?

2141
03:45:22,541 --> 03:45:24,102
[SPEAKER_11]: To me, it seems a little odd.

2142
03:45:25,346 --> 03:45:34,214
[SPEAKER_15]: So when I started the position, that's what we had and we do have our teachers' schedules are full, going back and forth from both schools.

2143
03:45:34,354 --> 03:45:37,677
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if there's anything else.

2144
03:45:38,678 --> 03:45:44,243
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think there's a balance with the specialists in every building.

2145
03:45:45,665 --> 03:45:49,388
[SPEAKER_18]: If you look at maybe the art teachers in the different buildings, they may have more.

2146
03:45:50,095 --> 03:45:53,018
[SPEAKER_18]: than the Columbus and the McGlynn have.

2147
03:45:53,078 --> 03:45:55,360
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think it's a balance that they do.

2148
03:45:56,121 --> 03:45:57,362
[SPEAKER_18]: As opposed to a need?

2149
03:45:59,985 --> 03:46:01,286
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not sure how it began.

2150
03:46:01,346 --> 03:46:04,529
[SPEAKER_18]: It was before me, but that's what it looked like years ago.

2151
03:46:04,549 --> 03:46:05,530
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Superintendent.

2152
03:46:05,550 --> 03:46:12,437
[SPEAKER_23]: So another aspect of it is the fact that in some cases we have programs like the TLP program that needs its own person to cover.

2153
03:46:17,885 --> 03:46:24,151
[SPEAKER_23]: some other specialized programs so that the schedule around them requires a little differentiated staffing.

2154
03:46:25,872 --> 03:46:26,152
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

2155
03:46:26,252 --> 03:46:28,755
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

2156
03:46:28,775 --> 03:46:28,835
[SPEAKER_21]: Ms.

2157
03:46:28,855 --> 03:46:29,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Millstone.

2158
03:46:31,617 --> 03:46:36,862
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I've never even heard of an adaptive physical education teacher, so that seems very exciting.

2159
03:46:37,702 --> 03:46:42,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Is the plan that they would co-teach with Mr. McGlenn at the Roberts?

2160
03:46:43,942 --> 03:46:48,963
[SPEAKER_05]: or would they go in and tell Mr. McGlynn or share ideas with Mr. McGlynn and travel the schools?

2161
03:46:49,523 --> 03:46:51,263
[SPEAKER_15]: So it would be a teacher for the full district.

2162
03:46:51,803 --> 03:46:55,944
[SPEAKER_15]: We could co-teach and have that teacher go in and teach with physical education teachers.

2163
03:46:56,324 --> 03:47:03,525
[SPEAKER_15]: It could also be a point where we still have students in inclusion, but we give them also an alternative where we also pull out and are able to work one-on-one.

2164
03:47:04,165 --> 03:47:04,645
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2165
03:47:05,666 --> 03:47:05,886
[SPEAKER_22]: Good.

2166
03:47:06,746 --> 03:47:08,486
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Russo, follow-up?

2167
03:47:09,446 --> 03:47:12,807
[SPEAKER_11]: The safety care training and protocol that

2168
03:47:13,960 --> 03:47:16,141
[SPEAKER_11]: that your staff have.

2169
03:47:17,141 --> 03:47:33,808
[SPEAKER_11]: I was under the impression that this body had adopted safety care across the district, and I wasn't sure who has been trained or has not been trained on that, and you probably don't actually have the answer, but is this new for your staff to do this?

2170
03:47:33,988 --> 03:47:35,369
[SPEAKER_15]: So I know my staff has been trained.

2171
03:47:35,389 --> 03:47:38,510
[SPEAKER_15]: We've been doing it for the past two years, and they have to retrain every year.

2172
03:47:39,050 --> 03:47:40,071
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an every year training.

2173
03:47:42,824 --> 03:47:43,564
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Benedetto.

2174
03:47:43,764 --> 03:47:44,144
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2175
03:47:44,885 --> 03:47:52,586
[SPEAKER_24]: That's run out of the special education department is my understanding under Kathy Medaglio and that student services.

2176
03:47:54,287 --> 03:48:00,408
[SPEAKER_24]: I know because at my school, I'm the trainer in safety care and in CPI.

2177
03:48:02,409 --> 03:48:11,051
[SPEAKER_24]: So what happens is that you need a team of teachers that are able to respond to an emergency situation so you can be called away.

2178
03:48:11,708 --> 03:48:34,957
[SPEAKER_24]: and a gym teacher or a physical education teacher or other specialists are usually on that team because they have the most flexibility in their schedule and can respond very quickly to different situations, whereas a classroom teacher might have at any given time 20 students in their care and not be able to respond easily.

2179
03:48:36,192 --> 03:48:48,296
[SPEAKER_24]: Physical education teachers, on the other hand, I call them classroom teachers because they do teach classes of children, but they just have a little bit more flexibility about being around the building.

2180
03:48:50,237 --> 03:48:56,959
[SPEAKER_24]: And they're alone sometimes in different areas of the building, so it's good to have them trained.

2181
03:48:56,979 --> 03:48:57,299
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

2182
03:48:57,319 --> 03:48:58,540
[SPEAKER_22]: Are there any other questions?

2183
03:49:00,040 --> 03:49:01,822
[SPEAKER_22]: All those in favor all those opposed.

2184
03:49:01,842 --> 03:49:02,842
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you very much.

2185
03:49:02,862 --> 03:49:03,543
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

2186
03:49:03,603 --> 03:49:05,565
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you Financial report

2187
03:49:20,834 --> 03:49:21,254
[SPEAKER_21]: Good evening, Ms.

2188
03:49:21,394 --> 03:49:21,634
[SPEAKER_21]: Pappas.

2189
03:49:21,714 --> 03:49:22,274
[SPEAKER_22]: Good evening.

2190
03:49:22,374 --> 03:49:25,655
[SPEAKER_17]: I had hoped Rachel would offer up some exercises in between.

2191
03:49:25,675 --> 03:49:26,815
[SPEAKER_17]: I know, wake us up a little.

2192
03:49:26,875 --> 03:49:28,856
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, we'll keep trucking along here.

2193
03:49:28,876 --> 03:49:32,716
[SPEAKER_17]: A little yoga.

2194
03:49:33,117 --> 03:49:37,758
[SPEAKER_17]: So the first item we have for you is the financial report.

2195
03:49:38,698 --> 03:49:44,859
[SPEAKER_17]: As a reminder, the document that's provided is the expanded document, budget document, that focuses on

2196
03:49:45,323 --> 03:49:49,644
[SPEAKER_17]: the DESE reporting by function category, schools, departments.

2197
03:49:50,425 --> 03:49:57,847
[SPEAKER_17]: The bottom line that we are looking at is the total appropriation amount plus the revenue that the schools balance their budget.

2198
03:49:58,507 --> 03:50:11,971
[SPEAKER_17]: So open budget lines were in concert with our past budgets to identify some of those DESE categories and our revenue offsets will be adjusted at year end, just going into the financial reporting.

2199
03:50:12,605 --> 03:50:22,111
[SPEAKER_17]: So again, as the financial report identifies, we approach the final two months projecting a balanced budget for the fiscal year ending 2018.

2200
03:50:22,972 --> 03:50:25,153
[SPEAKER_17]: This has been a very challenging year.

2201
03:50:25,633 --> 03:50:30,016
[SPEAKER_17]: We've had to deal with multiple unexpected and increased cost factors, significant.

2202
03:50:31,437 --> 03:50:42,004
[SPEAKER_17]: Still with those challenges, we've had some resourceful development and applications of supplemental revenue that we will enable the school system to meet its obligations

2203
03:50:42,560 --> 03:50:48,263
[SPEAKER_17]: barring any additional major unforeseen situations that could occur in the next two months.

2204
03:50:49,384 --> 03:50:59,010
[SPEAKER_17]: As we prepare for our upcoming fiscal year and with the new superintendent budget process, we do need to augment several accounts and sustain our resources and revenue generation abilities.

2205
03:50:59,850 --> 03:51:03,993
[SPEAKER_17]: New expenditures must be carefully prioritized and choices will have to be made.

2206
03:51:04,413 --> 03:51:09,656
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, as we hear all the great things that every department and schools want to accomplish,

2207
03:51:10,345 --> 03:51:18,127
[SPEAKER_17]: That does impact the budget and what we will be requesting at the end of our FY19 budget process.

2208
03:51:18,807 --> 03:51:29,230
[SPEAKER_17]: We are also, as you are aware, in collective bargaining with our union personnel, which is significant and going into the FY19 budget without any indication.

2209
03:51:30,230 --> 03:51:36,074
[SPEAKER_17]: Every year at this time, we freeze discretionary funds to monitor the balances through year end.

2210
03:51:36,694 --> 03:51:46,060
[SPEAKER_17]: There are several unexpected additional budget drivers that are being carried at this time without known ending dates, with security overtime as a prime example.

2211
03:51:47,121 --> 03:51:52,944
[SPEAKER_17]: The following we've identified have incurred post-budget approval from fiscal year 2018.

2212
03:51:53,345 --> 03:51:57,727
[SPEAKER_17]: The first item was our regular transportation.

2213
03:51:57,788 --> 03:51:58,448
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, we had

2214
03:51:59,043 --> 03:52:17,054
[SPEAKER_17]: been proactive to reduce one bus and we had to add more than one route back into the schedule for those important programs that were identified post-budget, which were for the newcomers, the additional after-school runs, and new Columbus after-school tutoring programs.

2215
03:52:18,075 --> 03:52:19,836
[SPEAKER_17]: Additionally, homeless transportation

2216
03:52:20,360 --> 03:52:29,912
[SPEAKER_17]: continues to grow despite efforts to mitigate costs by utilizing mileage reimbursements and shared rides and consolidations.

2217
03:52:30,032 --> 03:52:35,539
[SPEAKER_17]: This is an area that impacts many school districts in the Commonwealth, not just Medford.

2218
03:52:36,687 --> 03:52:40,711
[SPEAKER_17]: Audit expenses were significantly different.

2219
03:52:40,751 --> 03:52:45,895
[SPEAKER_17]: We had a new auditor, so those are charged to the schools that are within the school committee area.

2220
03:52:46,696 --> 03:52:49,598
[SPEAKER_17]: Specialized one-to-one nurses for severe needs students.

2221
03:52:49,719 --> 03:52:54,463
[SPEAKER_17]: Those required hiring of nurses that were not anticipated in the FY18 budget.

2222
03:52:55,384 --> 03:52:59,187
[SPEAKER_17]: Additional staffing for the consolidation of the high school and vocational school.

2223
03:53:00,198 --> 03:53:08,584
[SPEAKER_17]: That did also impact the budget, and yet it has been very successful in that implementation and transition.

2224
03:53:10,426 --> 03:53:15,590
[SPEAKER_17]: Security over time, as we know that continues to be a cost factor.

2225
03:53:17,746 --> 03:53:26,853
[SPEAKER_17]: And as we go through the general fund, as we looked at the approval for FY18, it was the $56,431,000, of which we are at 82 percent.

2226
03:53:26,933 --> 03:53:32,898
[SPEAKER_17]: So if you categorize that over 12 months, we are right on track for the last 20 percent over May and June.

2227
03:53:34,419 --> 03:53:42,726
[SPEAKER_17]: We did have the approved free cash vote for security and E-rate items that is added to our bottom line budget, increasing the total amount to $56,925,000.

2228
03:53:45,528 --> 03:53:50,650
[SPEAKER_17]: So again, we identify how many pay periods each bargaining group has received.

2229
03:53:51,391 --> 03:53:59,454
[SPEAKER_17]: When we review the specific categories, salaries is always an area that has fluidity.

2230
03:53:59,994 --> 03:54:08,638
[SPEAKER_17]: The undistributed salary line has been expensed and dispersed to various account deficits in line with where some transition and movement has occurred.

2231
03:54:09,750 --> 03:54:22,400
[SPEAKER_17]: So the special ed categories have historically not had an affiliated budget amount as much of those amounts are supported by some of the outside revenue offsets that we project and plan as part of the budgeting process.

2232
03:54:22,860 --> 03:54:31,567
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, as we look at the expanded document, those are DESE reporting categories, not necessarily our bottom line item.

2233
03:54:33,635 --> 03:54:44,280
[SPEAKER_17]: We have numerous retirements that will have some contractual vacation and or sick time buybacks that will occur, some within the FY18 and others that can be planned for FY19.

2234
03:54:46,362 --> 03:54:49,443
[SPEAKER_17]: and that's in accordance with their collective bargaining agreement language.

2235
03:54:50,463 --> 03:54:53,044
[SPEAKER_17]: Security continues to be a priority.

2236
03:54:53,364 --> 03:54:58,525
[SPEAKER_17]: We continue to demonstrate the commitment for ensuring the safety at all the school site locations.

2237
03:54:59,245 --> 03:55:03,266
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, we've added the cameras, locks, and door monitoring coverage.

2238
03:55:03,986 --> 03:55:10,428
[SPEAKER_17]: However, the unanticipated level of overtime in this category continues to impact the budget right now.

2239
03:55:11,207 --> 03:55:18,529
[SPEAKER_17]: and was not planned for in reference to the additional overtime component.

2240
03:55:19,249 --> 03:55:24,470
[SPEAKER_17]: And a long-term funding solution will need to be addressed and or planned going forward.

2241
03:55:25,810 --> 03:55:38,193
[SPEAKER_17]: Technology, the commitment of infusing $102,000 of funding into the schools at the beginning of the year was accommodated in order to have that utilization over the course of fiscal year 18.

2242
03:55:39,360 --> 03:55:56,448
[SPEAKER_17]: that did provide additional support for testing and instructional support district-wide, and we will continue to make those technology improvements with the E-rate funding and the upgrades that are intended to take place over the summer to be ready for the FY19 school year.

2243
03:55:57,688 --> 03:56:08,573
[SPEAKER_17]: Our utilities, we always try to be conservative in budgeting and projecting in that category, and we encumber based on historical years usage and what we anticipate the

2244
03:56:09,860 --> 03:56:11,761
[SPEAKER_17]: contractual amounts to be going forward.

2245
03:56:11,841 --> 03:56:20,685
[SPEAKER_17]: Next year, beginning in November of 2018, we will have a change in the electricity rate, so we will have to plan and project for that.

2246
03:56:21,645 --> 03:56:24,906
[SPEAKER_17]: Currently, the natural gas rates are favorable.

2247
03:56:25,006 --> 03:56:36,471
[SPEAKER_17]: However, we have seen an increase in our therm usage due to some of the cold winter months, and we will have expenditures higher in that line item prior than the previous year.

2248
03:56:37,533 --> 03:56:39,955
[SPEAKER_17]: for that purpose because of the higher therm usage.

2249
03:56:41,076 --> 03:56:50,464
[SPEAKER_17]: The second half of the expense activity was timeframe January through March, so we still have April, May, and June of utility bills to be processed.

2250
03:56:50,864 --> 03:57:00,712
[SPEAKER_17]: So we do, again, maintain an encumbrance to accommodate the anticipated invoices that will come through the end of June.

2251
03:57:02,813 --> 03:57:04,234
[SPEAKER_17]: best estimate at this point.

2252
03:57:04,314 --> 03:57:11,697
[SPEAKER_17]: We do not know what those actuals will be, so we are keeping those encumbrances in place right now.

2253
03:57:14,799 --> 03:57:26,424
[SPEAKER_17]: So our year-to-date expense, again, is trending slightly higher than our midpoint last year, about $47,949 higher, and we will likely expend the full budget amount in our electricity line.

2254
03:57:27,417 --> 03:57:42,694
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, the city and schools are in communication and cooperation trying to identify other energy improvements that will continue to help maintain and hopefully reduce some costs with other projects in line.

2255
03:57:43,789 --> 03:57:55,817
[SPEAKER_17]: So in summary, we are working very hard to contain the costs for this year with all of the unexpected items that have occurred and minimize the year-end purchases to offset some of those identified challenges.

2256
03:57:56,838 --> 03:58:12,229
[SPEAKER_17]: As we prepare for the 18-19 budget, it's imperative that we recognize the increases in some of the major categories and prioritize with the anticipation of collective bargaining settlements, our continued investment in security and transportation, as well as all the variable costs.

2257
03:58:12,743 --> 03:58:23,126
[SPEAKER_17]: such as the staffing needs that we've heard about that are so important, utilities that are going to hit, and all of the other important areas for our budget.

2258
03:58:23,286 --> 03:58:24,006
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you very much.

2259
03:58:24,586 --> 03:58:27,647
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Benedetto.

2260
03:58:27,787 --> 03:58:28,147
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

2261
03:58:28,527 --> 03:58:30,467
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you for your report.

2262
03:58:30,787 --> 03:58:37,029
[SPEAKER_24]: Do you happen to have a breakdown of the additional security costs since we added the dual monitors?

2263
03:58:38,067 --> 03:58:43,832
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, as you can see, the overtime is roughly 30,000 between the two line items.

2264
03:58:46,134 --> 03:58:58,184
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's just in this line item, so we do have other overtime costs that are in other program areas, such as community schools and other areas as well that have door coverage.

2265
03:58:59,323 --> 03:59:04,847
[SPEAKER_24]: I was just wondering what the total cost was that, and I don't know how difficult that'd be for you to get to us.

2266
03:59:05,047 --> 03:59:11,230
[SPEAKER_24]: Just an idea so that we can use that figure to pre-plan for next year, if that's the route that we're gonna go.

2267
03:59:11,250 --> 03:59:12,511
[SPEAKER_24]: It would be helpful.

2268
03:59:13,532 --> 03:59:16,414
[SPEAKER_24]: Also, could you provide us a copy of the last audit?

2269
03:59:16,514 --> 03:59:22,717
[SPEAKER_24]: I know it was requested at one of our... It is just being finalized right now.

2270
03:59:22,977 --> 03:59:23,177
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

2271
03:59:23,198 --> 03:59:26,179
[SPEAKER_17]: So it hasn't been held, it just hasn't been completed.

2272
03:59:26,499 --> 03:59:26,960
[SPEAKER_17]: Perfect.

2273
03:59:27,848 --> 03:59:28,188
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2274
03:59:28,689 --> 03:59:31,690
[SPEAKER_24]: So could we have that on the requested reports list, please?

2275
03:59:32,651 --> 03:59:36,293
[SPEAKER_24]: A copy of the audit, the last financial audit.

2276
03:59:37,594 --> 03:59:37,834
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

2277
03:59:38,354 --> 03:59:45,419
[SPEAKER_24]: And while we were talking about security, you brought up a question that is really not for you, Ms.

2278
03:59:45,459 --> 03:59:45,959
[SPEAKER_24]: Patterson.

2279
03:59:45,999 --> 03:59:46,519
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, though.

2280
03:59:47,320 --> 03:59:48,641
[SPEAKER_24]: It's for the mayor.

2281
03:59:49,241 --> 03:59:55,665
[SPEAKER_24]: Could you please, with all respect, give us an update on the report from the Martha Coakley law firm?

2282
03:59:56,190 --> 04:00:00,653
[SPEAKER_22]: We have not received the report from Foley-Hoag, Martha Coakley's report.

2283
04:00:01,553 --> 04:00:07,617
[SPEAKER_22]: It obviously, the police report came in much later than we anticipated, so she wanted to make sure she had that information.

2284
04:00:08,258 --> 04:00:10,359
[SPEAKER_22]: So we are hopeful that we will have it in the next week.

2285
04:00:12,300 --> 04:00:12,440
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

2286
04:00:12,641 --> 04:00:21,266
[SPEAKER_24]: And a follow-up, it's not so much a financial follow-up, but a few more reports that were requested that weren't on the requester reports list.

2287
04:00:21,306 --> 04:00:25,609
[SPEAKER_24]: So while I was talking about it, I thought I'd bring it up to Mr. Belson.

2288
04:00:26,457 --> 04:00:36,759
[SPEAKER_24]: A report on the traffic pattern at the pool door so that way we can make determinations if we're moving that person at nine o'clock in the morning down to the vocational school.

2289
04:00:37,539 --> 04:00:40,160
[SPEAKER_24]: Could you add that to the list so that can be provided to us?

2290
04:00:41,000 --> 04:00:42,200
[SPEAKER_24]: It's just a tally, really.

2291
04:00:43,440 --> 04:00:48,642
[SPEAKER_24]: The community school usage I just received now, so I'll look at that.

2292
04:00:49,202 --> 04:00:50,282
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, we got this tonight.

2293
04:00:50,762 --> 04:00:53,903
[SPEAKER_24]: This has all the rentals for the community schools for the year, I believe.

2294
04:00:54,063 --> 04:00:55,783
[SPEAKER_24]: Is that what this report is?

2295
04:00:58,129 --> 04:01:01,551
[SPEAKER_17]: That's rentals and just general usage of the building.

2296
04:01:01,871 --> 04:01:07,254
[SPEAKER_17]: And again, that was, there was no ill intent of not providing that.

2297
04:01:07,274 --> 04:01:11,957
[SPEAKER_17]: It was this sheer volume of not being able to, and we utilized our graphics department to accommodate that.

2298
04:01:11,977 --> 04:01:13,298
[SPEAKER_24]: No, I appreciate you having it.

2299
04:01:13,338 --> 04:01:17,240
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm gonna look at it, and if I have any questions, I'll bring them up at our next meeting.

2300
04:01:17,640 --> 04:01:21,042
[SPEAKER_24]: I just wanted to say thank you for providing that for us.

2301
04:01:22,083 --> 04:01:25,124
[SPEAKER_24]: And I know the financial report on that is coming up next.

2302
04:01:27,386 --> 04:01:38,235
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Belson's report on the cost analyst feasibility study for the items suggested on the building and grounds meeting, that report is not listed here.

2303
04:01:40,257 --> 04:01:50,706
[SPEAKER_24]: Remember, Roy, you were talking about giving us a feasibility study and prices for the buildings and grounds items that were suggested.

2304
04:01:55,013 --> 04:01:57,414
[SPEAKER_22]: He can't, yeah, he's having trouble understanding.

2305
04:01:57,574 --> 04:02:00,475
[SPEAKER_22]: You want something, can you write down the reports that you believe are missing?

2306
04:02:00,755 --> 04:02:00,935
[SPEAKER_24]: Yep.

2307
04:02:01,235 --> 04:02:04,917
[SPEAKER_22]: Instead, and then submit it, just email him tomorrow and he can look them over?

2308
04:02:05,177 --> 04:02:07,818
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, and I just want to announce them so everybody knows as well.

2309
04:02:08,178 --> 04:02:18,242
[SPEAKER_24]: In requested number of bullying reports completed by school, that was requested by someone I noticed in the minutes that wasn't added to the list.

2310
04:02:19,202 --> 04:02:21,844
[SPEAKER_24]: Bullying reports.

2311
04:02:21,864 --> 04:02:22,904
[SPEAKER_24]: The number by school.

2312
04:02:23,612 --> 04:02:29,394
[SPEAKER_24]: And again, the list of retirements coming forward, so that way we have that data as well.

2313
04:02:33,115 --> 04:02:33,515
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2314
04:02:33,715 --> 04:02:42,518
[SPEAKER_24]: I really appreciate the report you provided to us on the finance budget and the time that your department took to present this to us.

2315
04:02:42,738 --> 04:02:43,138
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2316
04:02:44,978 --> 04:02:47,699
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion to approve report and place on file.

2317
04:02:51,360 --> 04:02:52,460
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I just have two questions.

2318
04:02:52,480 --> 04:02:53,921
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much for putting this together.

2319
04:02:54,641 --> 04:02:58,842
[SPEAKER_10]: On page one of 13, this is of the financial year budget expenditure.

2320
04:02:59,683 --> 04:03:04,024
[SPEAKER_10]: Could you just explain what errors and omissions, what that line item is?

2321
04:03:04,044 --> 04:03:06,865
[SPEAKER_24]: That's insurance coverage for the school district.

2322
04:03:07,145 --> 04:03:07,765
[SPEAKER_10]: I see, I see.

2323
04:03:07,805 --> 04:03:10,186
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, thank you just for clarifying that for my brain.

2324
04:03:10,206 --> 04:03:12,007
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm a little sleepy right now.

2325
04:03:12,027 --> 04:03:19,409
[SPEAKER_10]: And also, on page two of 13, I had a question about the photocopy lease and purchase.

2326
04:03:20,031 --> 04:03:27,417
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, that was a renewal of the leases throughout the district, and there was a slight increase.

2327
04:03:27,477 --> 04:03:35,404
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a contractual increase, so there are two payment installments left, roughly $11,000 each, so the incumbent stands correct at $22,000.

2328
04:03:35,484 --> 04:03:35,884
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

2329
04:03:35,944 --> 04:03:37,425
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are my questions.

2330
04:03:38,806 --> 04:03:39,027
[SPEAKER_22]: Very good.

2331
04:03:39,607 --> 04:03:42,930
[SPEAKER_22]: There's a motion on the floor to accept this report and place it on file.

2332
04:03:42,970 --> 04:03:45,332
[SPEAKER_22]: Is there a second by Mr. Russo?

2333
04:03:45,532 --> 04:03:45,712
[SPEAKER_22]: Ms.

2334
04:03:45,872 --> 04:03:46,893
[SPEAKER_22]: Van de Kloot, did you have a question?

2335
04:03:48,488 --> 04:03:49,730
[SPEAKER_06]: for staying so long tonight.

2336
04:03:50,030 --> 04:03:52,634
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it's a long drive home too, so I really appreciate it.

2337
04:03:53,375 --> 04:03:55,138
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll be getting breakfast on my way home.

2338
04:03:55,338 --> 04:03:55,518
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

2339
04:03:55,919 --> 04:03:56,400
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Kirsten.

2340
04:04:00,062 --> 04:04:04,105
[SPEAKER_22]: We also have up next is the financial report on community schools programs.

2341
04:04:04,565 --> 04:04:04,805
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

2342
04:04:05,045 --> 04:04:11,949
[SPEAKER_17]: So again, this is a recap of the activity that has occurred to date.

2343
04:04:12,130 --> 04:04:14,831
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, it's important to understand.

2344
04:04:14,871 --> 04:04:27,219
[SPEAKER_17]: I gave this a little bit more of a learning curve for some of the new members just so that you understood how the revolving accounts and which community schools falls under is handled.

2345
04:04:28,021 --> 04:04:39,905
[SPEAKER_17]: So again, your packet included the community schools programming, which you received a large packet this evening for all the dates and times and locations of everything throughout the school year.

2346
04:04:40,905 --> 04:04:49,728
[SPEAKER_17]: You also received the program documents for the rentals, the athletic revolving, the Conti rink, Edgerly Field, and the swimming pool.

2347
04:04:50,588 --> 04:04:54,770
[SPEAKER_17]: So again, the program managers have provided summaries of all of their

2348
04:04:56,073 --> 04:05:17,198
[SPEAKER_17]: recorded revenues, expenditures, and as I went through and did what you could call a pseudo-internal audit, they do a very good job, a thorough job, of keeping their records and knowing what is out there and what hasn't been posted at the hall with regard to some of their physical deposits and or things that are in transit.

2349
04:05:19,259 --> 04:05:21,401
[SPEAKER_17]: a good handle on what the activity is.

2350
04:05:22,281 --> 04:05:30,588
[SPEAKER_17]: So also provided is the, again, the large packet is from our facility scheduler.

2351
04:05:30,708 --> 04:05:35,952
[SPEAKER_17]: It's an online product that is maintained by Rachel Perry.

2352
04:05:35,992 --> 04:05:37,233
[SPEAKER_17]: That's a huge undertaking.

2353
04:05:37,333 --> 04:05:46,080
[SPEAKER_17]: So as you can imagine, all of these items had to be hand-keyed by each school and each activity level.

2354
04:05:46,221 --> 04:05:47,662
[SPEAKER_17]: So there's a significant amount

2355
04:05:48,382 --> 04:05:53,666
[SPEAKER_17]: maintenance that goes into these and oversight for all of these programs under community schools.

2356
04:05:55,147 --> 04:05:58,009
[SPEAKER_17]: So these community schools are revolving accounts.

2357
04:05:58,069 --> 04:06:03,614
[SPEAKER_17]: They have continuous activity, which rolls over year after year with any applicable fund balance.

2358
04:06:04,114 --> 04:06:07,256
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, their mass general law intent is a

2359
04:06:08,237 --> 04:06:20,700
[SPEAKER_17]: self-supporting program, should have receipts and revenues to cover the related expenses, and as a cost structure for nonprofit entities, it's considered a break-even model, if you will.

2360
04:06:20,820 --> 04:06:24,461
[SPEAKER_17]: So your activities should support what you need to pay out.

2361
04:06:24,841 --> 04:06:31,423
[SPEAKER_17]: However, there are unexpected issues that occur within a program area, just as there are within a general budget.

2362
04:06:31,903 --> 04:06:36,084
[SPEAKER_17]: So there were some significant areas that had some high

2363
04:06:36,978 --> 04:06:39,079
[SPEAKER_17]: levels of maintenance and things of that sort.

2364
04:06:40,701 --> 04:06:52,788
[SPEAKER_17]: So the intent of the program again is to provide services to the greater Medford community, engaging with parents, staff, and outside organizations to facilitate partnerships between the schools and our constituents.

2365
04:06:53,189 --> 04:07:02,415
[SPEAKER_17]: So again, as we think of community schools, we think of the engagement with our parents, our community leaders, and the like.

2366
04:07:03,665 --> 04:07:10,089
[SPEAKER_17]: So as we go through the additional by category, we first have the Edgerly Fields.

2367
04:07:10,670 --> 04:07:12,611
[SPEAKER_17]: That's program number 321.

2368
04:07:13,511 --> 04:07:17,554
[SPEAKER_17]: And the account purpose is to collect rental fees for the use of the fields.

2369
04:07:18,575 --> 04:07:21,957
[SPEAKER_17]: There was a major renovation project for this.

2370
04:07:22,017 --> 04:07:29,241
[SPEAKER_17]: And so there is bond and interest payments that is automatically charged and absorbed.

2371
04:07:29,341 --> 04:07:30,342
[SPEAKER_17]: And for this year, it was 90,500.

2372
04:07:32,251 --> 04:07:40,915
[SPEAKER_17]: So against our operating receipts and expenditures, that program also absorbed that additional component.

2373
04:07:41,695 --> 04:07:54,940
[SPEAKER_17]: But we have a balance in that account, roughly 43,000, and the spring is a very active rental season, so we anticipate additional expected growth in that fund balance for year-end through June.

2374
04:07:56,041 --> 04:07:57,681
[SPEAKER_17]: Our athletic revolving program is 361.

2375
04:07:59,437 --> 04:08:06,900
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, the account purpose for this program is for sport user fees and gate fees for all the various fall, winter, and spring sports.

2376
04:08:07,380 --> 04:08:18,844
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's important and noteworthy to identify that the athletic programs on both the general budget and the revolving account are significantly underfunded at this point in time.

2377
04:08:18,944 --> 04:08:29,088
[SPEAKER_17]: We are in a new MIAA league, and there are significant costs that go with that, including transportation that takes us further up and down

2378
04:08:29,817 --> 04:08:35,482
[SPEAKER_17]: the coast where the league that we used to be in was right in our backyard, Malden, Medford, and the like.

2379
04:08:35,643 --> 04:08:39,446
[SPEAKER_17]: So we have some significant costs with the new league.

2380
04:08:39,486 --> 04:08:42,509
[SPEAKER_17]: We also have additional coaching.

2381
04:08:42,569 --> 04:08:45,292
[SPEAKER_17]: We have additional officials expense.

2382
04:08:45,712 --> 04:08:49,836
[SPEAKER_17]: So this is a program area that struggles to sustain itself.

2383
04:08:49,976 --> 04:08:51,077
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think it's important to

2384
04:08:51,651 --> 04:08:52,412
[SPEAKER_17]: understand that.

2385
04:08:53,653 --> 04:09:04,041
[SPEAKER_17]: While it currently shows an $8,000 deficit, many of the spring user fees have not yet been collected, and it's anticipated that we will break even at the year end.

2386
04:09:05,202 --> 04:09:18,013
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, we are part of the Northeast Conference with 16 schools that go up the North Shore as far as Gloucester, and it has created additional burdens on our regular athletic accounts and impacts the revolving fund due to

2387
04:09:19,120 --> 04:09:21,821
[SPEAKER_17]: some low home team attendance for gate receipts and the like.

2388
04:09:23,621 --> 04:09:39,664
[SPEAKER_17]: So moving forward into our community schools, the community schools is the revolving program 362, which its account purpose is to collect rental fees for use of facilities at all buildings, the high school and all of the outside schools.

2389
04:09:40,524 --> 04:09:45,365
[SPEAKER_17]: While this program shows a deficit of roughly $29,778, we have many annual rental fees

2390
04:09:48,322 --> 04:10:02,591
[SPEAKER_17]: that have not been collected, such as our AIC rental here at the high school, Tibetans, a new renter for the Redemption Church, as well as some summer camp deposits that we would anticipate a break-even status for year-end.

2391
04:10:03,551 --> 04:10:14,218
[SPEAKER_17]: Our community schools engage many participants, ranging from the Japanese language school, some not-for-profit recreation groups, independent functions and the like that truly enhance the community involvement.

2392
04:10:14,734 --> 04:10:24,477
[SPEAKER_17]: And I would guess that in your interactions with your constituents that they always have good things to say about the extracurricular events that take place at all of our buildings.

2393
04:10:24,557 --> 04:10:30,139
[SPEAKER_17]: And this is where those funds are received and the expenses are taken out.

2394
04:10:30,179 --> 04:10:35,961
[SPEAKER_17]: And that includes for the summer fun camp and the vacation camps as well.

2395
04:10:37,642 --> 04:10:44,444
[SPEAKER_17]: The Luconte Rink is a revolving program 365 whose account purpose collects the rental fees for the use of the ice rink.

2396
04:10:45,453 --> 04:10:48,435
[SPEAKER_17]: The rink shows a fund deficit of $79,000.

2397
04:10:48,915 --> 04:10:57,942
[SPEAKER_17]: However, we do have revenues that are outstanding, totaling $73,600 that will bring the program toward a break-even status at year end.

2398
04:10:58,522 --> 04:11:03,366
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, this is a difficult area to project out and maintain.

2399
04:11:03,386 --> 04:11:12,492
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a significant amount of maintenance that goes into this facility with the ice and utilities that it costs to run and keep the facility cold.

2400
04:11:13,277 --> 04:11:17,220
[SPEAKER_17]: So there are significant costs that will impact that program area.

2401
04:11:18,501 --> 04:11:27,629
[SPEAKER_17]: The swimming pool is program 631, whose purpose is for the use of the pool by community groups, individuals, and the like.

2402
04:11:28,690 --> 04:11:40,660
[SPEAKER_17]: The pool has sustained significant unpredictable charges this year, including $13,000 for the lane and motor repairs, as well as a spike in the custodial overtime due to the

2403
04:11:41,832 --> 04:11:43,633
[SPEAKER_17]: unexpected security component.

2404
04:11:44,273 --> 04:11:53,439
[SPEAKER_17]: So the pool shows an approximate deficit of 44,000, but we do have 8,800 in physical deposits that are in transit that we are researching with the hall.

2405
04:11:54,059 --> 04:11:59,903
[SPEAKER_17]: And we do have the spring months coming up that do provide more pool activity.

2406
04:12:00,783 --> 04:12:07,147
[SPEAKER_17]: People see the sunshine, they get excited, they want to swim, they want to use the pool for upcoming birthday parties and the like.

2407
04:12:08,978 --> 04:12:33,628
[SPEAKER_17]: So it is also noteworthy that the pool, when it was brought back online, that it may not generate the highest level of revenue, but it is an important offering to the community recreation department, and there's substantial use during the open swim hours, and I think that's important to share that you do have people from the community using the pool during those additional hours.

2408
04:12:35,231 --> 04:12:45,518
[SPEAKER_17]: So from the words of our committee member, DiBenedetto, it's not necessarily what we want to hear, but this is the truth here this evening on the community schools.

2409
04:12:45,638 --> 04:12:54,864
[SPEAKER_17]: So we are going in with our best foot forward and collect everything that we possibly can and hope to break even on all of these accounts.

2410
04:12:58,626 --> 04:12:59,026
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2411
04:13:01,268 --> 04:13:04,930
[SPEAKER_24]: So I went by each item.

2412
04:13:05,738 --> 04:13:08,040
[SPEAKER_24]: I found it easy to do it that way.

2413
04:13:08,440 --> 04:13:16,666
[SPEAKER_24]: So with Edgerly Field, I took the total deposits of $142,374.50, and then the expenses that were listed were $162,916, which means a difference of $20,000, a little bit more, in the red.

2414
04:13:33,582 --> 04:13:35,944
[SPEAKER_24]: but we had money in the account prior to that, right?

2415
04:13:36,344 --> 04:13:38,405
[SPEAKER_24]: So we're not really in the red in that thing.

2416
04:13:38,846 --> 04:13:42,988
[SPEAKER_24]: Does that include the bond and the insurance?

2417
04:13:43,629 --> 04:13:45,190
[SPEAKER_24]: Because I know- The bond and the interest, yes.

2418
04:13:45,230 --> 04:13:46,250
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, that includes everything.

2419
04:13:46,270 --> 04:13:46,651
[SPEAKER_17]: The 90,000, yes.

2420
04:13:46,751 --> 04:13:52,455
[SPEAKER_24]: I knew a few years ago we got into a little trouble with that and the city helped us out and I'm glad to see that added in.

2421
04:13:52,535 --> 04:13:52,755
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

2422
04:13:52,835 --> 04:13:54,196
[SPEAKER_24]: I just want to say thank you for that.

2423
04:13:56,217 --> 04:13:59,759
[SPEAKER_24]: I just want to make sure that the revenue coming in, that we're really,

2424
04:14:00,956 --> 04:14:02,917
[SPEAKER_24]: having everybody pay for all the things.

2425
04:14:04,298 --> 04:14:10,982
[SPEAKER_24]: I'd also like to see the personnel in the payroll issues listed when we get these reports.

2426
04:14:12,423 --> 04:14:16,165
[SPEAKER_24]: I know that's a lot and I don't know if that's easy to do or not easy to do.

2427
04:14:17,966 --> 04:14:20,327
[SPEAKER_24]: And I got the usage, that was my other note.

2428
04:14:20,948 --> 04:14:27,191
[SPEAKER_24]: You provided us with the usage of who's on Edgeley Field as well as any buildings, right?

2429
04:14:27,452 --> 04:14:27,832
[SPEAKER_24]: Correct.

2430
04:14:28,052 --> 04:14:28,272
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

2431
04:14:30,837 --> 04:14:38,961
[SPEAKER_24]: And you know what I really was hoping to see in part of this is donations of use time on our fields.

2432
04:14:39,161 --> 04:14:52,668
[SPEAKER_24]: Like a list of people in the community, we donate time on the fields, on our buildings, because that's a PR thing, like we care about the community, we donate.

2433
04:14:52,808 --> 04:14:59,731
[SPEAKER_24]: I know Mr. Maloney definitely provides many people in our community time,

2434
04:15:00,090 --> 04:15:05,694
[SPEAKER_24]: to use our facilities and donated, and that was part of the computer program that I had hoped we would get that.

2435
04:15:06,055 --> 04:15:11,419
[SPEAKER_24]: And maybe that's in that, I just haven't had a chance tonight, there's been so many goings on, to read this.

2436
04:15:12,099 --> 04:15:20,926
[SPEAKER_24]: So maybe someone could clarify that for me, if that's in this, or how that's being tracked, because that was requested a couple times throughout the years.

2437
04:15:21,750 --> 04:15:30,997
[SPEAKER_17]: If I can respond, as we reviewed all of the data and information, I did not come across a significant amount of donated time.

2438
04:15:31,398 --> 04:15:41,866
[SPEAKER_17]: As you can see, the schedule is quite booked, so the majority of our usage is through a true facility rental and paid accordingly.

2439
04:15:42,326 --> 04:15:44,868
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

2440
04:15:45,169 --> 04:15:50,633
[SPEAKER_24]: Just in general in the future, I mean, people tell me all the time about different things going on,

2441
04:15:52,055 --> 04:15:57,537
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't see some of those things listed, so that's why I thought they were more of donation.

2442
04:15:57,877 --> 04:16:01,039
[SPEAKER_24]: So we can move on to the athletic revenue expenses.

2443
04:16:01,939 --> 04:16:09,642
[SPEAKER_24]: So I just wanted to be forthright and clear, the income for the athletics department was $81,974.25, and the expenses were $93,044.78, so the difference there is $11,000

2444
04:16:21,003 --> 04:16:26,184
[SPEAKER_24]: But that's not the end of the year, like you said, the gate things.

2445
04:16:26,684 --> 04:16:40,028
[SPEAKER_24]: And as far as employees for the athletics department, they're usually under the school employee people and not generally listed under athletics in this capacity.

2446
04:16:40,288 --> 04:16:43,689
[SPEAKER_17]: Right, for coaching and the like, those are a budgeted item.

2447
04:16:43,869 --> 04:16:43,989
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

2448
04:16:44,623 --> 04:16:46,843
[SPEAKER_24]: just getting through it all.

2449
04:16:47,264 --> 04:16:48,524
[SPEAKER_24]: And then community schools.

2450
04:16:49,024 --> 04:16:51,584
[SPEAKER_24]: So this is the biggest amounts.

2451
04:16:54,705 --> 04:17:09,068
[SPEAKER_24]: So my first question is AIC, Japanese schools, the church, those ones that you listed, we don't know what those amounts are and we also don't know when those payments are coming in.

2452
04:17:09,471 --> 04:17:11,212
[SPEAKER_24]: Could you provide us some of the information?

2453
04:17:11,292 --> 04:17:13,494
[SPEAKER_17]: They had not been issued as of this time.

2454
04:17:13,534 --> 04:17:21,420
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, as indicated, they're an annual rental invoice, so those are just being produced and going out shortly.

2455
04:17:22,020 --> 04:17:33,249
[SPEAKER_24]: Do you mind just telling us an update as those go out, so just like when they went out, how much they're being charged, and how that affects their budget.

2456
04:17:33,489 --> 04:17:35,591
[SPEAKER_24]: Also, the community schools income is 201,146.41,

2457
04:17:39,174 --> 04:17:44,417
[SPEAKER_24]: The expenses here are only $18,310.08, if I did my numbers right.

2458
04:17:45,418 --> 04:17:52,262
[SPEAKER_24]: So the total income is $191,836, is that correct?

2459
04:17:53,142 --> 04:17:57,185
[SPEAKER_17]: The item that's not listed for community schools expense is their payroll.

2460
04:17:59,086 --> 04:18:01,187
[SPEAKER_17]: So that would be an additional component.

2461
04:18:01,587 --> 04:18:03,048
[SPEAKER_24]: That does not include the payroll?

2462
04:18:03,308 --> 04:18:03,468
[SPEAKER_24]: No.

2463
04:18:04,389 --> 04:18:04,589
[SPEAKER_24]: All right.

2464
04:18:05,292 --> 04:18:08,294
[SPEAKER_24]: Could we get that number when we get the updated list of people?

2465
04:18:08,474 --> 04:18:09,314
[SPEAKER_24]: That would be helpful.

2466
04:18:09,515 --> 04:18:12,656
[SPEAKER_24]: And maybe just add it to this so we see it all at one time.

2467
04:18:13,136 --> 04:18:13,757
[SPEAKER_24]: That would be great.

2468
04:18:14,837 --> 04:18:15,898
[SPEAKER_24]: Moving forward.

2469
04:18:20,340 --> 04:18:32,487
[SPEAKER_24]: I also thought that there was a theater group that was using the high school theater at the same time that the high school musical was trying to be put on, because I think they rented it, or I don't know if it was donated,

2470
04:18:32,924 --> 04:18:37,306
[SPEAKER_24]: I think some of our other members' children were in that program, so I don't know the name of it.

2471
04:18:37,687 --> 04:18:42,149
[SPEAKER_24]: There was a theater group that was being, they were practicing up at the high school.

2472
04:18:42,689 --> 04:18:44,350
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Belson, do you know about that?

2473
04:18:49,193 --> 04:18:51,094
[SPEAKER_24]: But their practices were at the same time.

2474
04:18:52,835 --> 04:18:53,915
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, okay.

2475
04:18:54,816 --> 04:18:58,558
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, there was some production up at the high school using the theater.

2476
04:19:01,599 --> 04:19:02,700
[SPEAKER_24]: Was it an Arlington group?

2477
04:19:06,245 --> 04:19:06,806
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, it wasn't.

2478
04:19:09,228 --> 04:19:20,997
[SPEAKER_24]: So there was an Arlington group that using the Karen Theater, and I'm assuming that they rented it out, and there were conflict in timing.

2479
04:19:24,760 --> 04:19:33,207
[SPEAKER_24]: We got an email about this, Mr. Maloney, about the high school kids when they were, a parent sent it to us.

2480
04:19:33,247 --> 04:19:35,029
[SPEAKER_34]: Bobby Maloney, 61, Sheridan Ave, Medford.

2481
04:19:36,067 --> 04:19:38,829
[SPEAKER_34]: I talked to an individual, I talked to Mayor.

2482
04:19:39,169 --> 04:19:51,058
[SPEAKER_34]: The way the little theater rental works, Tony Shashikni, Dr. Perella, Aaron Keith, Sarah Grant, they give us their dates they want, then we go to the public.

2483
04:19:51,878 --> 04:20:00,445
[SPEAKER_34]: What happened was, I believe, I think it was Sarah Grant, changed her dates, and the Islington group had the theater booked.

2484
04:20:00,885 --> 04:20:05,208
[SPEAKER_34]: So they already had a contract, they paid, and they paid handsomely, by the way.

2485
04:20:06,387 --> 04:20:14,733
[SPEAKER_34]: So I spoke to one of the parents at Method High School, and I said, you can come into my office, you can look at the way we do the, and she was very happy with the phone call.

2486
04:20:15,614 --> 04:20:17,895
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, thank you for reaching out to that parent.

2487
04:20:17,935 --> 04:20:19,176
[SPEAKER_24]: I appreciate it.

2488
04:20:19,376 --> 04:20:20,497
[SPEAKER_24]: What Arlington group is that?

2489
04:20:20,517 --> 04:20:24,720
[SPEAKER_24]: Because I don't see it listed as on the commuter school rental.

2490
04:20:24,760 --> 04:20:26,341
[SPEAKER_34]: I'll be happy to email you in the morning.

2491
04:20:27,342 --> 04:20:27,582
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

2492
04:20:33,328 --> 04:20:36,730
[SPEAKER_34]: I want to say it was The Troublemakers.

2493
04:20:37,870 --> 04:20:38,511
[SPEAKER_34]: It was a play.

2494
04:20:39,691 --> 04:20:43,133
[SPEAKER_34]: I can get you the information in a moment.

2495
04:20:44,813 --> 04:20:45,093
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

2496
04:20:46,554 --> 04:20:47,975
[SPEAKER_24]: I'd appreciate that very much.

2497
04:20:48,075 --> 04:20:48,455
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2498
04:20:48,635 --> 04:20:54,578
[SPEAKER_24]: And so with what was presented, there is the $191,836 in this area, and other than the personnel.

2499
04:21:02,242 --> 04:21:02,843
[SPEAKER_24]: personnel.

2500
04:21:03,483 --> 04:21:04,464
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll come back to it.

2501
04:21:04,784 --> 04:21:05,805
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll come back to this.

2502
04:21:06,906 --> 04:21:11,009
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll just table it until we get that additional information.

2503
04:21:11,710 --> 04:21:12,451
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm almost done.

2504
04:21:12,511 --> 04:21:12,831
[SPEAKER_24]: Sorry.

2505
04:21:14,612 --> 04:21:20,557
[SPEAKER_24]: Uh, the La Conte rank, the income is 157,600 and 600 having trouble reading my writing this late and the expenses are $227,049 and 63 cents with a,

2506
04:21:32,629 --> 04:21:34,870
[SPEAKER_24]: a difference of $69,449.

2507
04:21:35,470 --> 04:21:40,893
[SPEAKER_24]: I know that this is a benefit to have a rink in our community.

2508
04:21:43,094 --> 04:21:55,419
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know if we can advertise more rink time or how we can help change that deficit, and maybe it will change by the end of this 17?

2509
04:21:55,459 --> 04:21:58,421
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

2510
04:22:00,382 --> 04:22:00,862
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, great.

2511
04:22:01,772 --> 04:22:06,993
[SPEAKER_24]: And the last one is the pool, which is income of $149,025.50 and expenses of $173,657 with a difference of $24,600.

2512
04:22:07,093 --> 04:22:10,074
[SPEAKER_24]: And I don't think that's terrible considering all the extra security over time.

2513
04:22:10,114 --> 04:22:11,254
[SPEAKER_24]: Was that allocated to the pool?

2514
04:22:11,274 --> 04:22:11,494
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, yep.

2515
04:22:28,522 --> 04:22:35,724
[SPEAKER_24]: So I think that's pretty good because we knew when we opened those pools that it was going to be a tight thing because of the cost of running a pool.

2516
04:22:36,284 --> 04:22:43,105
[SPEAKER_24]: So, and I think it's a value to our students and to the community, well worth the investment.

2517
04:22:43,545 --> 04:22:46,406
[SPEAKER_24]: I just want to thank you for providing me with these reports.

2518
04:22:46,806 --> 04:22:50,287
[SPEAKER_24]: And if you could follow up with those few questions, I'd appreciate it.

2519
04:22:50,827 --> 04:22:54,208
[SPEAKER_24]: And thank you for staying so late to answer some of these questions.

2520
04:22:54,348 --> 04:22:55,528
[SPEAKER_24]: I really do appreciate it.

2521
04:22:56,512 --> 04:22:58,874
[SPEAKER_24]: have a good understanding of this area.

2522
04:22:59,254 --> 04:23:02,376
[SPEAKER_24]: So any extra money, how is that allocated?

2523
04:23:02,436 --> 04:23:03,197
[SPEAKER_24]: Where does it go to?

2524
04:23:03,217 --> 04:23:05,859
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

2525
04:23:07,200 --> 04:23:10,622
[SPEAKER_24]: So do we have a balance in that account?

2526
04:23:11,543 --> 04:23:13,104
[SPEAKER_17]: No, this is the report for you.

2527
04:23:13,144 --> 04:23:15,085
[SPEAKER_17]: These are the balances as of right now.

2528
04:23:15,725 --> 04:23:22,810
[SPEAKER_17]: We have two months remaining that we're hoping to maximize our collections and get to a break-even point.

2529
04:23:24,672 --> 04:23:24,852
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

2530
04:23:30,575 --> 04:23:36,922
[SPEAKER_06]: Just real quick, on the annual rental fees, I guess it makes me a little nervous that we only collect them once a year.

2531
04:23:38,524 --> 04:23:43,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Can we insist that they be paid twice?

2532
04:23:45,011 --> 04:23:49,757
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if one of these goes out of business or something like that, we could really be left holding

2533
04:23:52,323 --> 04:24:02,771
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how much each of these, AIC, Tibetans, Redemption Church, I don't know how much they pay us, but I'm just concerned that maybe going forward it would be a better idea to collect.

2534
04:24:03,431 --> 04:24:05,853
[SPEAKER_17]: Certainly, that's part of the review of the contracts.

2535
04:24:05,913 --> 04:24:12,778
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, this was in place, so following that protocol has been an annual invoice.

2536
04:24:12,999 --> 04:24:13,559
[SPEAKER_06]: When are they due?

2537
04:24:14,380 --> 04:24:14,760
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry?

2538
04:24:14,780 --> 04:24:15,681
[SPEAKER_17]: When is the payment due?

2539
04:24:16,361 --> 04:24:17,182
[SPEAKER_17]: Before the end of June.

2540
04:24:18,102 --> 04:24:18,323
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

2541
04:24:18,463 --> 04:24:19,904
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd like to move it.

2542
04:24:20,512 --> 04:24:22,175
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it just makes me a little nervous.

2543
04:24:22,215 --> 04:24:35,454
[SPEAKER_17]: The concern or the issue with some of the groups is that if they don't have their utilization at the end or if there was correction in dates or times, they want to have that flexibility to be able to review and

2544
04:24:36,570 --> 04:24:43,252
[SPEAKER_17]: identified for the last couple of months because we're pre-billing in that respect for the last couple of months.

2545
04:24:43,272 --> 04:24:43,592
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

2546
04:24:43,852 --> 04:24:55,975
[SPEAKER_07]: But I guess I'm just suggesting a twice a year collection as opposed to... Again, these were contracts in place, so I didn't have that option.

2547
04:24:56,235 --> 04:24:59,836
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think that's something moving forward we can review with each of the groups.

2548
04:25:00,096 --> 04:25:00,296
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

2549
04:25:00,376 --> 04:25:00,656
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

2550
04:25:10,050 --> 04:25:10,993
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you.

2551
04:25:11,013 --> 04:25:14,423
[SPEAKER_17]: Great, thank you.

2552
04:25:52,053 --> 04:25:52,434
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll call the vote.
