1
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:16,791
Can you come in and congratulate him?

2
00:00:17,231 --> 00:00:18,211
Give him a citation.

3
00:00:18,231 --> 00:00:19,532
Give him a citation.

4
00:00:19,932 --> 00:00:24,913
Josh, I'm going to recommend that you come in for a citation.

00:03:38,167 --> 00:03:43,754
No city-owned or private utilities or other structures are adversely impacted.

20
00:03:43,794 --> 00:03:50,762
National Grid shall ensure that all sewer water and drain lines are marked prior to any evacuation.

21
00:03:50,802 --> 00:03:56,189
National Grid will provide payment to the city in lieu of final trench paving.

22
00:03:57,774 --> 00:03:59,656
as built shall be provided.

23
00:04:00,076 --> 00:04:11,645

The contractor shall utilize City of Medford regulations and standards for restoration as well as remove

26
00:04:27,313 --> 00:04:28,794
All debris is related to this work.

Call 781-393-2425 for any accommodations.

28
00:04:34,676 --> 00:04:37,757
Plans can be reviewed at the city clerk's office.

29
00:04:39,358 --> 00:04:40,318
This is a public hearing.

30
00:04:43,339 --> 00:04:44,980
Do we have anyone from National Grid here?

31
00:04:52,123 --> 00:04:53,183
Name and address of the record, please.

32
00:04:53,891 --> 00:04:55,592
Matthew Carmody, construct supervisor, 170.

33
00:04:55,873 --> 00:04:58,414
And you're here and speaking in favor of this project?

34
00:04:58,594 --> 00:04:59,815
Yes, sir, from National Grid.

35
00:04:59,935 --> 00:05:00,236
Thank you.

36
00:05:00,256 --> 00:05:02,157
170 Medford Street, Malden.

37
00:05:02,297 --> 00:05:02,617
Thank you.

38
00:05:03,998 --> 00:05:06,300
Is there anyone else here speaking in favor of this project?

39
00:05:11,704 --> 00:05:13,545
Hi, my name is Alex Garcia-Mendoza.

40
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,967
I'm the project manager for 640 Ball Square.

41
00:05:16,207 --> 00:05:17,568
And you're speaking in favor of this project?

42
00:05:17,668 --> 00:05:17,969
Yes, sir.

43
00:05:17,989 --> 00:05:18,209
All right.

44
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:19,850
Anybody else?

45
00:05:21,111 --> 00:05:22,031
Hearing and seeing none.

46
00:05:23,328 --> 00:05:24,548
This part of the hearing is closed.

47
00:05:25,249 --> 00:05:28,490
Is there anyone here that is not in favor of this?

48
00:05:32,411 --> 00:05:35,253
Hearing and seeing none, that portion of the hearing is closed.

49
00:05:40,935 --> 00:05:41,375
National Grid.

50
00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:49,208
As you previously stated, this is a reinforcement for a new building going at 640, and we are on Boston Ave.

51
00:05:49,668 --> 00:05:59,655
We actually made considerations and it came to agreement to actually abandon our low-pressure main, so only one of our mains on that section will be abandoned and relayed with the new high-pressure.

52
00:06:00,135 --> 00:06:02,897
All services will be transferred over to the high-pressure main.

53
00:06:03,517 --> 00:06:07,901
So that will make sure that there's not multiple or congested area within that section.

54
00:06:07,921 --> 00:06:16,247
Um, the low pressure main certainly can not handle the load that is required for this new establishment and certainly for that area with what is required.

55
00:06:16,908 --> 00:06:28,497
Um, we've reviewed the plans with engineering, which they have certainly have approved to make sure that this will accommodate all parties and every, all as bills will be submitted to the, uh, city once we're done.

56
00:06:28,517 --> 00:06:28,837
Thank you.

57
00:06:29,337 --> 00:06:30,158
Councilor Scott Pelley.

58
00:06:30,779 --> 00:06:31,259
If I can,

59
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:33,187
Do you have the papers?

60
00:06:33,707 --> 00:06:34,468
How do you find them?

61
00:06:34,488 --> 00:06:35,809
I find them all in order.

62
00:06:35,849 --> 00:06:37,870
If I do have a few questions, Mr. President.

63
00:06:39,311 --> 00:06:40,152
Just real quick.

64
00:06:41,533 --> 00:06:43,834
Is there any work being done down Warren Street?

65
00:06:44,174 --> 00:06:45,955
Is it just down Boston Ave?

66
00:06:47,957 --> 00:06:54,141
Just the intersection of kind of Warren and Harvard, which would be the intersection and just the abandonment of that low pressure intersection.

67
00:06:54,561 --> 00:06:57,243
But the tying itself will come off of Harvard down.

68
00:06:57,623 --> 00:07:00,425
OK, it looks like you've contact all the abutters and I appreciate that.

69
00:07:01,351 --> 00:07:02,192
And that looks great.

70
00:07:02,593 --> 00:07:17,290
Um, again, I know it's just, the only thing that looks different to me is that, um, that the city will provide instead of paving that, um, we'd be compensated painfully quick.

71
00:07:17,761 --> 00:07:18,582
This is a pre-pave.

72
00:07:18,602 --> 00:07:21,644
You guys did water work going down that Boston area.

73
00:07:22,245 --> 00:07:29,031
Um, that'd be something that we can also certainly discuss at future time to the engineering, but this is also making sure there's no leaks or any future issues.

74
00:07:29,051 --> 00:07:30,733
Uh, their road you already paved.

75
00:07:30,873 --> 00:07:31,153
Excellent.

76
00:07:31,193 --> 00:07:31,433
Okay.

77
00:07:31,473 --> 00:07:33,015
I find everything in order, Mr. President.

78
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:33,715
Thank you.

79
00:07:35,637 --> 00:07:36,438
Councilor DelaRusso.

80
00:07:36,818 --> 00:07:36,878
Uh,

81
00:07:37,232 --> 00:07:41,875
Mr. President, if I can, through the chair, to the representative of National Grid.

82
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:48,899
Sir, so this is a new pipe, a new main that is being put in that's a high pressure one.

83
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:57,845
And then if I understand this correct, and the citizens understand this correct, that any other pipes that are carrying gas in there are being removed?

84
00:07:59,372 --> 00:07:59,792
Yes, sir.

85
00:07:59,872 --> 00:08:08,894
Any elite prone pipe or any, uh, existing piping will be replaced with new, uh, plastic material to ensure safety to community and reliability to our residents.

86
00:08:09,294 --> 00:08:09,655
Thank you.

87
00:08:10,335 --> 00:08:23,178
Uh, Mr. President, uh, I move approval on this and, uh, with the conditions that in the process of construction, uh, particular retention, uh, is paid.

88
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:27,992
to public safety matters and deference to the operation of St.

89
00:08:28,032 --> 00:08:34,574
Clement's schools, and also whatever religious exercises are being conducted within St.

90
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:45,478
Clement's Church, and that none of those operations be impeded or distracted during this time, and also to the adjacent businesses.

91
00:08:46,746 --> 00:08:57,414
Due to the large amount of work that was done in preparation for the extension of the Green Line in that area over the past two years, people have suffered tremendously.

92
00:08:57,794 --> 00:09:12,546
There were also three major construction projects undertaken by a local university in that area, and they created some disturbance and distress, as any project does, to the neighbors in that area.

93
00:09:12,826 --> 00:09:14,828
So we want to be particularly sensitive

94
00:09:15,292 --> 00:09:21,577
to the long period of duress that these people have existed under.

95
00:09:22,097 --> 00:09:23,158
Thank you, Councilor Dela Rousseau.

96
00:09:23,859 --> 00:09:24,699
Councilor Langlois-Grant.

97
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:26,941
Thank you, President Carviello.

98
00:09:27,141 --> 00:09:33,446
Could you let us know when you're going to start the work, when it's going to be done during the day or at night, and how long it's going to take?

99
00:09:34,472 --> 00:09:38,594
Um, we are currently waiting the MWRA permit, which we're hoping to receive in about a week to two weeks.

100
00:09:39,154 --> 00:09:43,676
Um, once that is done, I'll meet with the engineering department to confirm when work can begin.

101
00:09:43,696 --> 00:09:51,479
Um, I do know the, the building itself right now cannot withstand the heat that they're required to on the temporary line and low pressure.

102
00:09:51,539 --> 00:09:53,520
So we'd certainly like to start as soon as possible.

103
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,381
I'd say it's about a month, a month and a half week project.

104
00:09:56,881 --> 00:09:59,883
Um, just to not underestimate the duration of work.

105
00:10:00,463 --> 00:10:00,523
Um,

106
00:10:00,963 --> 00:10:07,086
In regards to the time restraints of when work can start and with John, that would also be something that would be coordinated with the city.

107
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:12,808
I do want to let you know that every letter does get my cell phone number and also our city councilman's number.

108
00:10:13,348 --> 00:10:22,872
So if there's any issues, something that needs to be coordinated, a special date or something with the school or also the church, they can call me directly and we do coordinate with the crews and make sure there's no issues going forward.

109
00:10:23,565 --> 00:10:29,787
And in that area, will there be any disturbances with regards to homes and blocking people's driveways?

110
00:10:29,967 --> 00:10:32,527
Or how far is it going to extend?

111
00:10:33,528 --> 00:10:34,848
There's an issue, say, for that day.

112
00:10:34,888 --> 00:10:37,529
We do have to cross people's driveways, obviously, do trench and cross.

113
00:10:37,909 --> 00:10:42,130
My foreman on site does put the no parking signs, does leave a letter to let them know.

114
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:44,150
And we can certainly plate the need to get out.

115
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:45,511
But we do let them know the day before.

116
00:10:46,211 --> 00:10:47,471
We will be starting at this time.

117
00:10:47,531 --> 00:10:50,632
If you can move your cars prior so that we would have no issues.

118
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:55,443
And how are the residents told the day before, just by a letter on their door?

119
00:10:55,943 --> 00:11:05,390
We usually give a two-day notice, but we also do put no parking signs, along with they do try to knock on the door, notify residents, so forth.

120
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:07,891
If we also can't get in touch with them, I do call them directly.

121
00:11:08,552 --> 00:11:08,872
Thank you.

122
00:11:08,952 --> 00:11:11,654
I echo Councilor DelaRusso's sentiments.

123
00:11:12,334 --> 00:11:15,917
They've been doing work, whether it be water work or construction in that area,

124
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:21,512
several months now and I've received complaints in the past with regards to people's driveways being blocked.

125
00:11:21,592 --> 00:11:28,638
So I just would ask that you do give that two day notice so people are aware and they can make other arrangements and not be inconvenienced.

126
00:11:29,299 --> 00:11:29,579
Certainly.

127
00:11:29,599 --> 00:11:30,040
We'll do so.

128
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,181
Thank you.

129
00:11:32,322 --> 00:11:32,862
Councilor Knight.

130
00:11:33,483 --> 00:11:34,804
Mr. President, thank you very much.

131
00:11:34,924 --> 00:11:41,209
Um, as previously noted, the similar matter was before the council, um, relative to electric lines, uh, several months back.

132
00:11:41,249 --> 00:11:43,051
And this council actually tabled that matter.

133
00:11:43,748 --> 00:11:51,693
based on concerns that we've had with National Grid and their ability to repair our roads into the proper fashion and as well as to repair private property in proper fashion.

134
00:11:52,254 --> 00:12:08,524
Mr. Camardi and I have had some dealings in the past relative to the trench work that was done on Doonan Street, and my level of satisfaction was limited in terms of the response that I got from National Grid and the steps that I needed to go through in order to get the private property that was damaged during that trench work repaired, and I'd hate to see the situation happen again.

135
00:12:09,665 --> 00:12:11,226
I'd ask Mr. Camardi if

136
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:17,811
national grids actually performing the work, if they have a contractor performing the work, or if the work is gonna be performed through the developer's contractor?

137
00:12:18,792 --> 00:12:20,473
It'll be a contractor performing the work.

138
00:12:20,893 --> 00:12:34,020
In regards to the industry, we did do a ground inlay for curb line to center line, and also the respectful homes that you're speaking of, we do have preliminary foot by videos and photographs taken along with post videos and photographs taken along with that.

139
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,922
It was also reviewed with the engineering department, construction department in the city of Medford.

140
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:43,551
I'd agree that that is the fact.

141
00:12:43,911 --> 00:12:48,334
Uh, however, I'd also agree that it took two and a half years to get the private property that was damaged fixed.

142
00:12:48,354 --> 00:12:49,815
Mr. President, that's a concern of mine.

143
00:12:50,275 --> 00:12:53,877
Um, in regards to this project, um, we've approved similar matters in the past.

144
00:12:54,517 --> 00:13:05,764
Um, I'm glad to see that a national grid is going to be, uh, in lieu of doing the final trench paving, um, handing the money over to the city so that the city can ensure a curb to curb, uh, pave when this construction project's done, Mr. President.

145
00:13:05,804 --> 00:13:08,206
So, um, as such, I rest my case and I move for approval.

146
00:13:08,526 --> 00:13:08,846
Thank you.

147
00:13:09,347 --> 00:13:10,027
Councilor Falco.

148
00:13:10,547 --> 00:13:11,268
Thank you, Mr. President.

149
00:13:11,508 --> 00:13:11,608
Um,

150
00:13:12,045 --> 00:13:18,498
But I have questions about the, uh, the actual group will provide payment to the city in lieu of taxes in lieu of a final trench paving.

151
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:22,627
Um, how do you come up with the amount that is being paid to the city?

152
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,872
It's really, it depends on every project, sir.

153
00:13:26,292 --> 00:13:33,878
Um, for this one in general, it's something that we'd have to discussed, um, pre, you know, prior to construction myself in the city of engineering, the engineering department for the city.

154
00:13:34,538 --> 00:13:42,225
Um, normally we'll do it for a prepaid project or something in regards to, and set us in lieu of doing our final restoration.

155
00:13:42,605 --> 00:13:46,248
We come to agreement for the certain amount, but that's something that has to come with my manager and not myself.

156
00:13:46,788 --> 00:13:51,672
So I'd have to meet with the city engineering department, um, for that amount and how the numbers comes about.

157
00:13:52,472 --> 00:13:54,733
And so you have not met with the city with regard to this yet?

158
00:13:55,394 --> 00:14:00,717
We want to first go through the grain and location, get them debris permit prior to anything with any agreements for that.

159
00:14:01,277 --> 00:14:09,221
So if we can find out from the city engineer, if they're going to be requesting curb to curb paving, because I would think that that amount is going to be.

160
00:14:10,782 --> 00:14:14,424
One of the information council and I, um, I do believe that the project is going to be curb to curb.

161
00:14:14,464 --> 00:14:20,968
I do believe that some linkage funds were, um, appropriated, uh, relative to some water main, uh, replacements.

162
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:21,808
And this is all part of that.

163
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:22,950
Thank you.

164
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:34,218
If we could get, but if you could get official word back from a city engineer that it is actual curb to curb and sits, um, sits, uh, you're providing payment in lieu of final trench paving.

165
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:40,061
If, uh, if say for a year from now, the paving sinks.

166
00:14:40,102 --> 00:14:42,823
So sometimes it sinks, you know, over, over time.

167
00:14:43,384 --> 00:14:44,705
Are we responsible for that?

168
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:49,268
Currently city's doing full depth reconstruction on the city and it's Boston app.

169
00:14:49,308 --> 00:14:49,768
That's why we,

170
00:14:50,338 --> 00:14:51,119
Certainly it would be on.

171
00:14:51,219 --> 00:14:51,819
It's on the city.

172
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:52,880
Do the final paving.

173
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:57,184
We do restore any trenches during that duration before you guys do your work, but that's for this.

174
00:14:57,244 --> 00:15:05,370
Why this is a different circumstance of us having to give Lou a paving because of the city's paving prior to this 30 planning on this.

175
00:15:05,411 --> 00:15:07,893
So that's why we're trying to do our work prior to your guys work.

176
00:15:07,933 --> 00:15:11,055
So it's not a week later that we're digging it up, digging up a leak.

177
00:15:11,355 --> 00:15:13,137
If there's any situations later, sir.

178
00:15:13,497 --> 00:15:13,677
Okay.

179
00:15:14,218 --> 00:15:15,299
Thank you for the clarification.

180
00:15:15,459 --> 00:15:15,639
Thanks.

181
00:15:16,502 --> 00:15:17,222
Councilor Scott Belli.

182
00:15:17,382 --> 00:15:21,163
If I can, I know we had one resident that just had a couple of questions.

183
00:15:22,024 --> 00:15:29,446
Um, uh, he came in a little late that just, just, uh, he wanted to ask the gas company a couple of questions.

184
00:15:29,466 --> 00:15:32,367
So if you can, um, Mr. Richard, if you can.

185
00:15:34,007 --> 00:15:35,008
Name and address of the record, please.

186
00:15:35,408 --> 00:15:37,388
Ron Richard, 603 Boston Ave.

187
00:15:37,988 --> 00:15:39,529
I just have a couple of questions for,

188
00:15:40,943 --> 00:15:42,343
Is it N-Star or National Grid?

189
00:15:42,924 --> 00:15:43,584
National Grid.

190
00:15:43,824 --> 00:15:44,144
Okay.

191
00:15:44,704 --> 00:15:46,404
Is it your people that are going to be doing the work?

192
00:15:46,705 --> 00:15:47,325
Our contractors.

193
00:15:48,205 --> 00:15:49,225
So it's sub-del?

194
00:15:49,725 --> 00:15:51,026
Yes, but I'll be on site every day, sir.

195
00:15:51,366 --> 00:15:52,766
There'll be someone on site every day.

196
00:15:53,566 --> 00:15:57,567
And I see the street already has the mock-outs out in the street.

197
00:15:57,747 --> 00:16:01,548
So you're going on the even side of the street?

198
00:16:02,089 --> 00:16:03,369
Same side as our main is currently, sir.

199
00:16:04,328 --> 00:16:12,772
I believe that's the even side, because just before Thanksgiving, they had the whole street dug up to replace water mains for this project.

200
00:16:12,852 --> 00:16:17,634
And you've got half the street, it's got a channel all the way up the side now.

201
00:16:18,615 --> 00:16:21,016
Now you're going to have another channel on the other side of the street.

202
00:16:21,056 --> 00:16:25,578
At least the city sent us a paper and said that they're going to repave in the spring.

203
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:45,411
Now, you know, I'd just like to know is this going to be it on the street or a couple of months down the road is some other utility going to come in and say they want to come up and dig now, which you get some nice street that's done and repaved over again and then all of a sudden you see another pothole because someone comes out and digs, you know.

204
00:16:46,192 --> 00:16:53,577
If we could get everyone on the same page to get there and do all the work because it's going to be an inconvenience for us.

205
00:16:54,636 --> 00:17:03,884
for one thing, because just that little four-week, three-week project we had for the little water main, you know, that was really a headache for all of us.

206
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:15,214
In the same regard, once you're ready to tie into the houses, how much notice are the residents going to have to get into the houses?

207
00:17:16,496 --> 00:17:18,117
Yeah, people are going to have to get in, correct?

208
00:17:18,477 --> 00:17:18,718
Yes, sir.

209
00:17:19,523 --> 00:17:26,566
Our contractor foreman on site will set up an appointment that works for both parties, obviously the resident and also the crew on site.

210
00:17:26,906 --> 00:17:31,108
What they'll do is give you about 48 hours, 72 hour notice, looking when they're trying to perform the work.

211
00:17:31,168 --> 00:17:34,450
If it has to be a week later, that's certainly acceptable.

212
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:38,892
What he'll do is he'll leave a letter on your door, say you're at work, with his number, cell phone number.

213
00:17:39,212 --> 00:17:42,274
You call him, he'll schedule an appointment with yourself for the work to be performed.

214
00:17:43,254 --> 00:17:48,397
Can it be turned on, the service be activated with the new system from house to house?

215
00:17:49,017 --> 00:17:49,177
Yes.

216
00:17:50,172 --> 00:17:54,994
So it should not really affect the house digging towards the house at all.

217
00:17:55,014 --> 00:17:57,135
There'll be about a three to four hour delay.

218
00:17:58,755 --> 00:18:01,256
So a contractor will form the piping work to your home.

219
00:18:01,536 --> 00:18:01,796
Yeah.

220
00:18:01,936 --> 00:18:06,498
Then a national group representative will do the piping work inside and the relay to your appliances.

221
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:07,298
Okay.

222
00:18:07,318 --> 00:18:09,499
So normally during that time is a three to four hour delay.

223
00:18:09,979 --> 00:18:12,540
And that'll mostly be a daytime operation, right?

224
00:18:12,881 --> 00:18:16,542
As far as would you extend till cause people work.

225
00:18:17,943 --> 00:18:30,309
And you know, if they're not going to have a gas service for their heat, hot water and cooking, you know, that's, that's going to be a hardship for some people if they don't get home from work till like five, five 30 or something like that.

226
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:32,550
Depends on the circumstances, sir.

227
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:36,132
We account, you know, we understand that people work during the day and we always make it work.

228
00:18:36,652 --> 00:18:36,913
Okay.

229
00:18:38,453 --> 00:18:38,733
All right.

230
00:18:39,514 --> 00:18:39,854
Thank you.

231
00:18:40,374 --> 00:18:41,155
Thank you, Mr. Richard.

232
00:18:45,177 --> 00:18:45,717
Councilor Marks.

233
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,802
Uh, thank you, Mr. President.

234
00:18:47,822 --> 00:18:56,731
And I think Mr. Richards raises a great point about a coordination of efforts, uh, because far too often he's correct.

235
00:18:56,751 --> 00:19:00,596
You see a project go on, uh, they repave the street and within, uh,

236
00:19:01,263 --> 00:19:07,191
a few months period of time, they're re-digging the street for another utility, which to me doesn't make any sense.

237
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:13,438
My question is, when will a bulk of this construction work take place?

238
00:19:13,478 --> 00:19:14,219
Is it during the day?

239
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,622
Will you be doing any digging at night?

240
00:19:17,543 --> 00:19:19,426
Can you explain the construction period?

241
00:19:20,474 --> 00:19:21,995
We plan to do all work during the day.

242
00:19:22,175 --> 00:19:25,738
There might be the intersection of Boston or Harvard.

243
00:19:25,778 --> 00:19:31,782
They might want the tying performed during the evening, but that's something that's coordinated during a pre-construction walk with the city.

244
00:19:32,943 --> 00:19:36,725
With the way it looks for construction, we keep the lane open, so there shouldn't be a traffic issue.

245
00:19:37,085 --> 00:19:41,288
Might be delayed permanent restriction time to make sure that the commuters can get through.

246
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:46,352
And then we'll start work, but there shouldn't be any too much night work that will be done before this job.

247
00:19:47,295 --> 00:19:50,957
So, so one of the lanes will be closed down during, during this construction.

248
00:19:51,877 --> 00:19:59,820
We would have to meet with the, uh, the captain and everyone for the, and the engineering department to confirm the traffic management plan at the start of work with my foreman on site.

249
00:20:00,761 --> 00:20:01,001
Okay.

250
00:20:01,721 --> 00:20:05,663
Um, when, when you do get confirmation of that, can you pass that on to this council?

251
00:20:06,143 --> 00:20:10,945
We certainly will go in the letter that sent out to all the butters for the startup work and also the council itself.

252
00:20:11,305 --> 00:20:11,485
Okay.

253
00:20:12,091 --> 00:20:17,574
And also, uh, we had a project, uh, I think it was a few years back, uh, something very similar to this.

254
00:20:18,454 --> 00:20:28,579
And, uh, lo and behold, uh, a lot of residents had concerns after hours, you know, seven, eight, nine o'clock at night of the smell of gas and so forth.

255
00:20:28,619 --> 00:20:40,565
Things that may be typical for this type of work, but we're concerning, uh, will you have someone that's on call that, uh, can be at the site, uh, to address issues of concern, uh, even after hours?

256
00:20:41,703 --> 00:20:48,188
I've had multiple residents call me at 9, 10 o'clock, sir, for multiple projects, and I always pick up my cell phone and respond to those calls.

257
00:20:48,769 --> 00:20:53,672
A lot of times, it's just because we are replacing the leak-prone pipe that has multiple leaks on there.

258
00:20:53,692 --> 00:20:54,893
That's the reason why we're replacing it.

259
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:59,897
And once you start to excavate, the smell or odor of gas does come up in the atmosphere.

260
00:20:59,917 --> 00:21:00,538
Right.

261
00:21:00,758 --> 00:21:02,519
So your number is available.

262
00:21:02,539 --> 00:21:04,601
You name a number to the residents in the area?

263
00:21:05,001 --> 00:21:06,062
Unfortunately, yes, sir.

264
00:21:06,082 --> 00:21:07,023
OK.

265
00:21:08,284 --> 00:21:08,584
Thank you.

266
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:14,608
Mr. Carmody, in no way are you saying that people that smell gas should call you.

267
00:21:14,668 --> 00:21:19,252
I think you're saying they should call the fire department, but if there are construction related issues that they should give you a call, correct?

268
00:21:20,565 --> 00:21:22,506
I get calls for multiple incidences.

269
00:21:22,526 --> 00:21:23,847
It's maybe the smell of gas.

270
00:21:24,127 --> 00:21:26,488
It could be the, you know, the relay guy got there a bit late.

271
00:21:26,849 --> 00:21:29,510
You know, they had to clear, they had to insert a new pipeline through.

272
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,751
There might be a bit of residual gas inside a home.

273
00:21:31,771 --> 00:21:33,592
It could be I smell gas on the street.

274
00:21:33,652 --> 00:21:34,933
It also could be the so forth.

275
00:21:34,973 --> 00:21:40,356
There is a number that I always give for emergency hotline for them to call immediately first, because it has to come from them.

276
00:21:40,896 --> 00:21:45,519
But I understand each home, the work that was performed each day and the situation that is at hand.

277
00:21:46,479 --> 00:21:49,081
I just hate to have individuals in the community calling the

278
00:21:49,481 --> 00:21:56,103
project construction coordinator, if they do smell gas in the street and there is actually a gas leak, I think that that would have to go to our first responders as well, Mr. President.

279
00:21:57,063 --> 00:21:57,683
Move approval.

280
00:21:58,904 --> 00:22:01,044
On the motion by Councilors, Chairman Scott Pelley.

281
00:22:01,064 --> 00:22:05,545
Motion to move forward.

282
00:22:06,446 --> 00:22:06,686
Second?

283
00:22:07,126 --> 00:22:07,406
Second.

284
00:22:08,866 --> 00:22:09,747
Second by Councilor Falco.

285
00:22:09,767 --> 00:22:10,387
All those in favor?

286
00:22:10,407 --> 00:22:10,887
Aye.

287
00:22:11,267 --> 00:22:11,587
Opposed?

288
00:22:11,627 --> 00:22:11,787
None.

289
00:22:12,587 --> 00:22:13,207
Motion granted.

290
00:22:13,948 --> 00:22:14,468
Thank you, John.

291
00:22:14,668 --> 00:22:14,988
Thank you.

299
00:23:28,274 --> 00:23:28,794
Where is it?

300

Wave the wreath.

303
00:23:48,652 --> 00:23:51,853
brief synopsis here is they are putting up some new poles there.

304
00:23:52,473 --> 00:24:07,019
Uh, no city owned public utilities, uh, should be, uh, should be, uh, uh, severely impacted in the national grid in Verizon will, uh, maintain all the city's standards and regulations.

Uh, councilor Scott Pelley, chairman Scott Pelley.

306
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,101
Thank you, Mr. President.

307
00:24:12,121 --> 00:24:12,941
I see that, uh,

308
00:24:14,105 --> 00:24:18,108
Both, uh, organizations done, um, all the work that's needed.

309
00:24:18,128 --> 00:24:27,256
Uh, all the departments have been approved and, uh, I move forward to, uh, to move in place.

310
00:24:27,836 --> 00:24:29,918
All those in favor of this project.

311
00:24:35,522 --> 00:24:36,603
Name and address of the record, please.

312
00:24:38,545 --> 00:24:42,268
Tim Leifert, National Grid Electric, 170 Medford Street, Malden, Massachusetts.

313
00:24:42,736 --> 00:24:43,937
and you are in favor of this project?

314
00:24:44,157 --> 00:24:44,437
Yes, sir.

315
00:24:44,597 --> 00:24:44,897
Thank you.

316
00:24:45,978 --> 00:24:48,360
Anybody in opposed, opposed this project?

317
00:24:49,761 --> 00:24:50,681
Hearing and seeing none.

318
00:24:52,122 --> 00:24:54,744
Are you opposed?

319
00:24:55,404 --> 00:24:57,206
I'm not sure if I'm opposed.

320
00:24:57,246 --> 00:25:03,490
I want to fully understand what's going to happen around my property because if I'm going to be inconvenienced to have to like.

321
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:03,950
Okay.

322
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:06,432
So, well, this is, this is the public hearing part.

323
00:25:06,592 --> 00:25:06,992
Okay.

324
00:25:07,032 --> 00:25:07,613
My first time.

325
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:09,674
So you're opposed to the project?

326
00:25:10,583 --> 00:25:12,745
For now, until I learn a little bit more.

327
00:25:12,825 --> 00:25:14,166
Name and address of the record, please.

328
00:25:14,226 --> 00:25:16,588
Kara Tucker, 18 Lambert Street, Medford, Mass.

329
00:25:17,268 --> 00:25:28,477
So I just found out that this was happening and I'm kind of concerned like where these poles and the construction work is gonna happen, because I reside right at this intersection, so the time of day.

330
00:25:28,497 --> 00:25:31,019
Okay, you can come, we'll get, you can come back after.

331
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:31,560
Okay.

332
00:25:32,881 --> 00:25:33,221
Thank you.

333
00:25:35,683 --> 00:25:37,104
We close that portion of the hearing.

334
00:25:38,165 --> 00:25:38,886
Councilor Scott Pelli.

335
00:25:41,785 --> 00:25:43,947
Chairman Scott Pelley, do you have a recommendation there?

336
00:25:44,407 --> 00:25:48,650
Yeah, no, I think if we can hear from the residents, I think that'd be the most important piece right now.

337
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:49,190
Okay.

338
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:49,250
Ms.

339
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:52,513
Tucker, if you wanna- Ma'am, would you like to come back and voice your opinion now?

340
00:25:53,613 --> 00:26:01,199
Yeah, so my opinion is trying to understand, I guess, where the polls are going and the time of day that this is gonna happen.

341
00:26:01,959 --> 00:26:03,781
So is my whole street gonna be shut down?

342
00:26:03,801 --> 00:26:05,402
Excuse me, did you answer the young lady?

343
00:26:09,159 --> 00:26:13,501
So as previously stated, um, we are going to be national grid electric.

344
00:26:13,521 --> 00:26:31,690
That is, it's going to be setting one new, um, wood pole and anchor, um, adjacent to the curb in the sidewalk on, um, I believe it's actually technically Sheridan street, but at the intersection of Sheridan and Lambert, um,

345
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:44,596
The pole itself is going to be replacing an existing tree fixture that we currently have in place that is a support for an existing pole across the street.

346
00:26:45,776 --> 00:26:49,378
As far as how it may impact the neighborhood,

347
00:26:50,374 --> 00:26:54,016
I don't believe traffic will be shut down completely.

348
00:26:54,937 --> 00:27:01,641
I do believe this type of construction will allow for a lane of traffic to remain open while the construction is being done.

349
00:27:03,363 --> 00:27:12,629
Pedestrian traffic in that area of the sidewalk, I believe, will be temporarily closed due to public safety while the pole is being installed.

350
00:27:13,289 --> 00:27:21,252
But I don't anticipate construction of this type to take more than an hour or two, something along those lines.

351
00:27:21,992 --> 00:27:26,913
Pedestrian traffic will have to be rerouted to the other side of the street during that time.

352
00:27:29,274 --> 00:27:38,297
As far as your particular address, 18, I don't anticipate there being much impact to that particular address.

353
00:27:39,667 --> 00:27:42,728
The pole itself I believe is going to be adjacent to 24.

354
00:27:43,749 --> 00:27:46,390
But are you running wires from this pole?

355
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:49,411
Are you running wires from this pole that are going to go diagonal this way?

356
00:27:49,431 --> 00:27:52,732
Because there's a, there's a telephone pole right here at the corner of my driveway of 18.

357
00:27:53,693 --> 00:28:00,175
So I possibly will be impacted depending on, you know, we park in that vicinity and everything.

358
00:28:00,275 --> 00:28:02,156
So getting in and out of.

359
00:28:03,476 --> 00:28:03,776
Certainly.

360
00:28:06,197 --> 00:28:10,940
So there, there won't be a wire installed directly in that direction.

361
00:28:11,381 --> 00:28:24,790
The wire is going to be installed from, um, the existing pole, which is directly adjacent to number 21 and it will be installed to the new pole location.

362
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:29,873
Um, and this wire will be higher than, um,

363
00:28:31,652 --> 00:28:37,355
telephone wires, communication wires, it will be well above, uh, that, that minimum height.

364
00:28:37,875 --> 00:28:38,115
Okay.

365
00:28:39,076 --> 00:28:40,897
And it will not answer your question.

366
00:28:40,917 --> 00:28:42,398
It will not be on that side of the street.

367
00:28:43,478 --> 00:28:44,079
All right.

368
00:28:44,439 --> 00:28:44,879
Are you happy?

369
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:45,339
Yeah.

370
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,200
Thank you.

371
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:46,900
Okay.

372
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:52,183
Uh, again, so just so it won't affect any, uh, visual site.

373
00:28:52,587 --> 00:28:54,748
It's not in the corner if people take in.

374
00:28:54,808 --> 00:28:57,649
So that's not, that won't, that that's not going to affect it, correct?

375
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:58,829
I don't believe so.

376
00:28:58,909 --> 00:29:08,992
No, it won't affect visual sites and it won't affect any type of large commercial traffic that may be going down that street.

377
00:29:09,012 --> 00:29:09,912
Okay.

378
00:29:09,932 --> 00:29:10,712
Nothing of that sort.

379
00:29:10,772 --> 00:29:10,853
No.

380
00:29:10,873 --> 00:29:11,453
All right.

381
00:29:11,493 --> 00:29:11,793
Thank you.

382
00:29:12,913 --> 00:29:13,733
Councilor.

383
00:29:14,394 --> 00:29:14,854
Thank you.

384
00:29:14,994 --> 00:29:15,794
President Carriello.

385
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:18,795
You said the work in total is only going to take about one to two hours.

386
00:29:19,762 --> 00:29:26,763
Installations of this type generally can be completed without any problem within that time frame, yes.

387
00:29:27,063 --> 00:29:28,544
And that's going to be done during the day?

388
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:32,885
Yes, I believe it's planned to be done on a regular work day.

389
00:29:34,185 --> 00:29:36,265
Do we know when that's scheduled for yet?

390
00:29:37,085 --> 00:29:38,586
I don't have that particular time.

391
00:29:39,146 --> 00:29:45,127
If that is requested by the council, I can certainly forward that information along when it's available to me.

392
00:29:45,938 --> 00:29:52,563
And the reasoning for putting the pole in, is there a safety issue with the existing, what is it, tree pole you said?

393
00:29:52,743 --> 00:30:05,934
I believe it was actually a request put in by the city to have the tree guy removed along with a number of other tree locations that we had fixtures into.

394
00:30:06,854 --> 00:30:07,115
Okay.

395
00:30:08,135 --> 00:30:08,436
Thank you.

396
00:30:08,656 --> 00:30:08,796
Yep.

397
00:30:10,217 --> 00:30:10,978
Vice President Mox.

398
00:30:13,037 --> 00:30:17,138
So is it my understanding that we're not replacing an existing pole?

399
00:30:17,819 --> 00:30:21,300
We're just moving a guide to a pole?

400
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,021
That is correct.

401
00:30:23,161 --> 00:30:23,421
Yeah.

402
00:30:23,441 --> 00:30:29,003
It's, it will be an entirely new pole installation and will not create a double pole situation.

403
00:30:30,103 --> 00:30:32,244
So it's not replacing a pole then?

404
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:33,004
No, sir.

405
00:30:33,624 --> 00:30:33,884
Okay.

406
00:30:33,904 --> 00:30:35,885
So it's definitely not creating a double pole.

407
00:30:36,045 --> 00:30:36,365
Correct.

408
00:30:36,865 --> 00:30:37,065
Okay.

409
00:30:37,526 --> 00:30:40,967
And, uh, what utilities do expect to be on this pole?

410
00:30:42,833 --> 00:30:47,216
It will just be National Grid, most likely.

411
00:30:48,637 --> 00:30:56,443
It came in on the petition as a joint-owned pole location because Verizon has not officially refused the pole location.

412
00:30:56,983 --> 00:31:03,328
But most likely it will only be National Grid, Guy Wire, on the new pole.

413
00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:07,670
So you don't expect any other utilities other than National Grid?

414
00:31:08,611 --> 00:31:10,492
We don't anticipate any other utilities, no.

415
00:31:10,552 --> 00:31:11,213
Okay, thank you.

416
00:31:12,855 --> 00:31:13,496
Councilor Nice.

417
00:31:14,716 --> 00:31:15,977
Mr. President, thank you very much.

418
00:31:16,478 --> 00:31:33,311
As we look through our packet and we see the petition here, um, the petitioner is also seeking permission to lay and maintain underground laterals, cables and wires in the above or intersecting public ways for the purpose of making connections with such poles and buildings as each of said petitioners may desire for distributing purposes.

419
00:31:36,313 --> 00:31:41,797
Is there any plan whatsoever to do underground work with relation to this project?

420
00:31:42,824 --> 00:31:46,187
Not in relation to this project or this specific location.

421
00:31:46,247 --> 00:31:46,407
No.

422
00:31:56,135 --> 00:32:00,098
So I would question, Mr. President, if that language is necessary and if that's something we need to approve.

423
00:32:00,118 --> 00:32:03,061
I don't think anybody has a problem giving them the poll to hide there.

424
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:04,862
I think it may be just standard language.

425
00:32:04,962 --> 00:32:06,924
It's just standard language.

426
00:32:07,891 --> 00:32:08,091
Is it?

427
00:32:08,251 --> 00:32:12,214
Because with the approval of it, we're also granting them the permission to lay and maintain underground cables.

428
00:32:12,234 --> 00:32:12,955
That's the standard.

429
00:32:25,125 --> 00:32:29,268
The plan that's before us, which is just OH guy, why a location?

430
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:34,412
If that is the case, Mr. President, I move approval.

431
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:40,891
Mr. Chairman, do you find everything in order?

432
00:32:41,071 --> 00:32:42,271
I find everything in order.

433
00:32:42,311 --> 00:32:43,472
I motion for approval.

434
00:32:43,732 --> 00:32:44,072
Thank you.

435
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:45,432
All those in favor?

436
00:32:45,452 --> 00:32:46,132
Aye.

437
00:32:46,933 --> 00:32:47,413
Opposed, none.

438
00:32:47,453 --> 00:32:47,873
Hearing none.

439
00:32:49,294 --> 00:32:49,914
Motion passes.

440
00:32:49,954 --> 00:32:50,274
Thank you.

441
00:32:56,556 --> 00:32:58,217
One more.

442
00:32:58,237 --> 00:32:58,937
17-045.

443
00:32:59,637 --> 00:33:02,738
Location of poles, attachments, fixtures, and underground conduits.

444
00:33:03,798 --> 00:33:08,220
You are hereby notified by order of the Memphis City Council, a public hearing will be given

445
00:33:09,072 --> 00:33:34,071
at Halden Memorial Auditorium, 85 George Street, George Behasa Drive, City Hall, Medford, on seven o'clock on Tuesday, January 31st, on a petition by National Grid of North Andover Mass with permission to locate poles, wires, and fixtures, including the necessary sustaining and protecting fixtures along and across the following public way.

446
00:33:36,013 --> 00:33:38,595
Rivers Edge Drive, National Grid to install

447
00:33:39,588 --> 00:34:04,914
60 feet of one, one dash three PVC conduit from MHA six to one in the street at river's edge driving cabin road in a north easterly direction to customers hand holds number six to one dash one in the sidewalk at 10 cabinet road and rivers edge drive to feed a traffic signal.

448
00:34:06,738 --> 00:34:12,020
Wherefore, it prays that motion by Councilor Marks to waive the reading.

449
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:17,021
What they're putting in, it looks like a light fixture there.

450
00:34:17,661 --> 00:34:19,982
It's been approved by all the necessary departments.

451
00:34:21,223 --> 00:34:22,183
Councilor Scott Pelli.

452
00:34:22,863 --> 00:34:23,843
Thank you, Mr. President.

453
00:34:24,984 --> 00:34:34,967
We find all the paperwork in order right now and it doesn't look like this is a new project and

454
00:34:36,675 --> 00:34:44,359
No one will be impacted, no business or private resident will be impacted with this project, so we move forward.

455
00:34:44,619 --> 00:34:45,659
All those in favor of this?

456
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:46,199
Aye.

457
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,040
No.

458
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,341
Anyone speaking in favor of this?

459
00:34:51,162 --> 00:34:54,083
Again, Tim Leifert, National Good Electric, 170 Medford Street, Malden.

460
00:34:54,643 --> 00:34:55,984
That motion of the hearing is closed.

461
00:34:56,924 --> 00:34:57,845
Anyone opposed to this?

462
00:35:00,426 --> 00:35:02,987
Hearing and seeing none, that portion is closed.

463
00:35:04,348 --> 00:35:05,008
Councilor Scarpelli.

464
00:35:05,868 --> 00:35:10,053
Again, I find that every department is signed off and approved.

465
00:35:10,273 --> 00:35:19,643
And again, this project is on the new Rivers Edge project and does not impact residents or any businesses.

466
00:35:19,703 --> 00:35:21,365
So I move forward to approval.

467
00:35:21,705 --> 00:35:22,045
Second?

468
00:35:23,827 --> 00:35:24,128
Second?

469
00:35:24,728 --> 00:35:25,810
Second by Councilor Del Rosso.

470
00:35:28,441 --> 00:35:29,901
Councilor, uh, vice president marks.

471
00:35:30,422 --> 00:35:37,544
If, if the gentlemen, I wouldn't mind just giving us a brief synopsis on the work that's going to take place, the length and time of the work and so forth.

472
00:35:38,504 --> 00:35:38,784
Certainly.

473
00:35:39,625 --> 00:35:49,508
As previously stated, national good is petitioning for approximately 60 feet of one three inch, uh, PVC electric conduit from existing manhole six 21,

474
00:35:51,093 --> 00:35:56,035
towards the property of 10 Cabot Road to service a new traffic signal.

475
00:35:57,375 --> 00:36:06,878
Installations of this type can be done within, I would say, two days, barring any problems along the way.

476
00:36:10,439 --> 00:36:18,502
And traffic should be able to remain open with at least one lane during construction.

477
00:36:23,805 --> 00:36:23,985
Yeah.

478
00:36:24,586 --> 00:36:25,126
How long is it?

479
00:36:25,306 --> 00:36:28,028
How long is it going to take installations of this type?

480
00:36:28,789 --> 00:36:30,169
Usually two days.

481
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:30,910
Two days.

482
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:33,832
Yeah.

483
00:36:33,872 --> 00:36:34,893
Mr. President, just if I could.

484
00:36:35,873 --> 00:36:37,634
That's an extremely busy road, actually.

485
00:36:37,854 --> 00:36:40,516
I'm not sure if you're I am very familiar with it.

486
00:36:40,556 --> 00:36:44,179
And over the past couple of years, yes, it's become it's become very busy road.

487
00:36:44,759 --> 00:36:47,921
Is there any way we can do some of this work at night and not impact?

488
00:36:48,401 --> 00:36:50,823
Because I could just imagine around rush hour.

489
00:36:51,622 --> 00:36:56,826
uh, that gets very busy there and could block traffic, uh, well past that area.

490
00:36:58,067 --> 00:36:58,447
Yes.

491
00:36:58,827 --> 00:37:06,913
Um, I can, I can certainly request that the, um, the work be done at night and, um, and get back to you directly.

492
00:37:07,353 --> 00:37:15,839
I would ask Mr. President that be part of the approval that the work take place at night based on, based on, or at least not during rush hour.

493
00:37:16,699 --> 00:37:20,162
That, that, that would be fine too, based on the traffic impact in that area.

494
00:37:20,222 --> 00:37:20,442
Okay.

495
00:37:29,309 --> 00:37:30,630
Not during rush hour or at night.

496
00:37:33,652 --> 00:37:37,855
On the motion by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

497
00:37:38,316 --> 00:37:39,096
All those in favor?

498
00:37:39,837 --> 00:37:40,537
All those opposed?

499
00:37:41,398 --> 00:37:42,098
Motion granted.

500
00:37:42,118 --> 00:37:42,659
Thank you.

501
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:43,680
Thank you.

502
00:37:47,863 --> 00:37:52,687
Motion by Councilor Falco to take report of committee 16574.

503
00:37:55,881 --> 00:37:56,741
Councilor Falco.

504
00:37:57,602 --> 00:37:58,522
Thank you, Mr. President.

505
00:37:58,742 --> 00:38:06,145
Um, this is, uh, basically, uh, uh, report from, uh, the ad hoc subcommittee on education.

506
00:38:06,165 --> 00:38:16,250
Uh, we met last week, uh, for the purpose of the meeting was to, uh, review and discuss the university, uh, accountability ordinance, uh, the members, uh, on the sub committee.

507
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:23,433
I'm the chair, uh, uh, also counselors, uh, Scott Pelley and call console Lungo Kerner on the committee as well.

508
00:38:24,819 --> 00:38:33,281
Uh, at the meeting we had city solicitor Mark Brumley, code enforcement officer John Babuso and we had Barbara Rubel and Rocco DeRico from Tufts University.

509
00:38:34,621 --> 00:38:38,482
Um, and we probably had about 10 to 15 residents from the surrounding neighborhood.

510
00:38:39,202 --> 00:38:45,764
Uh, the president, the, um, residents were actually a very happy and pleased with the ordinance.

511
00:38:46,284 --> 00:38:49,805
Uh, they were pleased to, uh, see that something was being done and, um,

512
00:38:50,488 --> 00:39:05,399
they felt that, and actually we all felt that this would be a tool that the code enforcement officer, John Babuso could use to help prevent overcrowding and to keep the neighborhoods that surround Tufts University safe.

513
00:39:05,999 --> 00:39:10,503
So I looked that we adopt the committee report tonight and move for the first reading.

514
00:39:13,345 --> 00:39:16,147
Motion by councilor Falco to take this first reading.

515
00:39:18,464 --> 00:39:19,045
Councilor Knight.

516
00:39:20,268 --> 00:39:27,964
Rule 35A of the Memphis City Council rules governing the operations of this body would indicate that the council president shall review all committee papers in the committee of the whole meeting.

517
00:39:29,783 --> 00:39:31,504
I personally have no problem with the ordinance.

518
00:39:31,544 --> 00:39:33,465
I feel as though the ordinance is a strong ordinance.

519
00:39:33,506 --> 00:39:37,328
It's a measure that I brought forward and sponsored at one point in time during this last session, Mr. President.

520
00:39:37,948 --> 00:39:42,812
Um, and whereas the rules are under suspension, I don't think that approval thereof, uh, will be harmful.

521
00:39:42,912 --> 00:39:50,917
However, uh, if there are other members that might want an opportunity to review the ordinance and to see, uh, what it includes before they vote on it, um, I raised the issue.

522
00:39:52,898 --> 00:39:53,819
Counselor Longo-Kern.

523
00:39:54,399 --> 00:39:56,140
Thank you, President Carviello.

524
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:57,501
I just want to, um,

525
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:02,866
I echoed Councilor Falco's sentiments.

526
00:40:02,946 --> 00:40:04,828
It's something we've worked on in committee.

527
00:40:05,228 --> 00:40:10,592
Two or three meetings, we met with directors from Tufts University.

528
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:14,215
They will be the largest institution that's affected by this ordinance.

529
00:40:14,795 --> 00:40:24,123
It will require Tufts University to report to the city twice a year with regards to, not by name, but by residential address,

530
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:30,150
residential address each one of their off-campus students reside at.

531
00:40:31,631 --> 00:40:44,899
Code enforcement officer John Mavuso did state that it will be a helpful tool within the city to, when he does get a complaint, it will be an extremely helpful tool to him.

532
00:40:44,979 --> 00:40:50,142
I also, I know the committee is looking for the city to do more than just have it as a tool.

533
00:40:50,202 --> 00:40:55,725
We're looking for enforcement of other ordinances that will help with enforcement of our other ordinances to keep

534
00:40:56,207 --> 00:40:58,348
the city and the units safer.

535
00:40:58,949 --> 00:41:10,856
Um, we did have some recommendations that were made and hopefully, um, Tufts university is looking to possibly looking into possibly helping the city with regards to some male manpower that we are down in the community.

536
00:41:10,876 --> 00:41:16,199
Uh, the building department, John Babuso, it does an amazing job, but he's only one person.

537
00:41:16,299 --> 00:41:23,263
So to be able to enforce this the way I think the committee and the neighbors, especially in that area want it done,

538
00:41:23,784 --> 00:41:25,144
we do need more personnel.

539
00:41:25,344 --> 00:41:45,109
Um, so hopefully some of the recommendations I believe that we made is that Tufts point of information council Dela Rosa, I think a year and a half ago to two years ago at the request of this body, uh, the mayor finally hired an additional inspector, uh, to assist Mr. Thank you.

540
00:41:46,689 --> 00:41:49,890
And as our code enforcement officer said last,

541
00:41:51,040 --> 00:42:00,523
Tuesday night when we met in committee, there's still not enough manpower to do the enforcement that should be done with getting this information on a bi-yearly basis.

542
00:42:00,543 --> 00:42:03,624
So that is a concern and that is an issue.

543
00:42:03,724 --> 00:42:12,446
And we did ask that Tufts report back if the university can inform the students and landlords of the potential violations and fines by the city.

544
00:42:12,906 --> 00:42:15,047
If there are four more non-related renters,

545
00:42:15,618 --> 00:42:22,024
that the mayor report back on what assistance the administration can do to provide assistance to our code enforcement officer.

546
00:42:22,044 --> 00:42:33,494
And that on section 2644, second paragraph, that superintendent of the office of inspectional services be eliminated and in its place code enforcement officer be inserted.

547
00:42:34,175 --> 00:42:35,556
So I'm very hopeful.

548
00:42:35,596 --> 00:42:39,419
I'm glad that we got the opportunity to work on this and meet with the appropriate personnel.

549
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,342
I thank my colleagues for working on it.

550
00:42:42,876 --> 00:42:48,838
Um, I, I understand if people need another week to, to review it, but as far as I'm concerned, I have reviewed it.

551
00:42:48,998 --> 00:42:56,621
We went over it in depth with our city solicitor last week with regards to in committee and I'm ready to move approval tonight.

552
00:42:57,121 --> 00:42:57,441
Thank you.

553
00:42:58,081 --> 00:42:58,922
Council Scott Pelly.

554
00:42:59,662 --> 00:43:00,062
I can.

555
00:43:00,322 --> 00:43:01,422
Uh, thank you Mr. President.

556
00:43:01,462 --> 00:43:05,704
Again, thank uh, uh, council, uh, council night bringing this up.

557
00:43:06,311 --> 00:43:18,509
uh, some time ago, but I think that, uh, our ad hoc subcommittee, um, has worked diligently with the neighbors and, uh, and from what I gather with the neighbors and their discussion.

558
00:43:19,571 --> 00:43:39,579
was the fact that getting this move forward quickly, um, and spending more time and getting them, uh, and waiting for what, what has been some issues and, uh, their response, even in emails today, this evening, thanking us, this committee to actually go out and, and work toward this, this endeavor.

559
00:43:39,619 --> 00:43:47,983
And, and, and again, you, you see what a great partner Tufts University is and Barbara and Rocco and the, the, the,

560
00:43:48,497 --> 00:44:00,767
open communication that they have, know each other from first name basis and understanding when there are issues that Tufts is there to support our neighbors and working together with them with this situation.

561
00:44:00,827 --> 00:44:16,619
So again, I appreciate the hard work and I also appreciate my colleagues understanding and looking into this a little bit further because it is a, it is in a very important endeavor, but we worked very, very diligently on this and

562
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:20,431
We heard from a lot of people and, um, asked a lot of questions.

563
00:44:20,531 --> 00:44:30,855
And, um, I know that councilor Falco chaired that committee and, uh, I thought that, um, I'm, I personally am ready to move forward and with, with the vote.

564
00:44:31,015 --> 00:44:33,096
And, uh, again, thank you for everybody's hard work.

565
00:44:33,896 --> 00:44:34,176
Thank you.

566
00:44:34,196 --> 00:44:34,937
Counselor Scott, probably.

567
00:44:35,397 --> 00:44:35,997
Counselor Knight.

568
00:44:36,497 --> 00:44:37,438
Um, yes, Mr. President.

569
00:44:37,598 --> 00:44:44,260
Um, if the chairman of the subcommittee would be so kind as to maybe explain to us the differences between the initial proposal and the paper that's before us.

570
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:46,741
Counselor Falco, would you like to address that?

571
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:58,220
The, uh, the, the, the, the, the paper that originally came to our subcommittee, um, basically did not have, uh, that many, we didn't have that many changes.

572
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:08,190
I mean, that, uh, we met a few times, went over the, the language of the city solicitor Romley and, um, the, the residents had a lot of questions.

573
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:11,413
Um, you know, and actually one of the things I wanted to point out was,

574
00:45:11,867 --> 00:45:16,428
towards the end of the meeting, they were curious as to how our process works here.

575
00:45:17,189 --> 00:45:21,190
And they asked about, you know, the timing and whatnot, because they want to see something sooner than later.

576
00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:22,970
And we completely understand that.

577
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:27,672
I mean, they live in a neighborhood with a lot of students, and there's a lot of concerns.

578
00:45:28,332 --> 00:45:39,415
And so we explained to them how it has to go through three readings, and we told them basically how, you know, explained to them how customarily we do not waive the three readings, and we go through that process.

579
00:45:39,991 --> 00:45:41,152
And they were completely on board with that.

580
00:45:41,192 --> 00:45:41,792
They were fine.

581
00:45:42,452 --> 00:45:47,856
They agreed that it should, you know, go through its process and, uh, but they just wanted to see something sooner than later.

582
00:45:48,356 --> 00:45:58,742
Um, but I think, uh, you know, the changes, one of the big changes was to, uh, that council Longo current had mentioned was, uh, to basically, um, change some of the language on section 26 dash 44.

583
00:45:59,282 --> 00:46:05,446
Um, and, uh, we did reach out to Tufts to see if they could help us enforce this as well.

584
00:46:06,187 --> 00:46:06,767
And, um,

585
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:21,721
And I'll also just ask if the mayor could report back to see if there is a further assistance, um, to, uh, get some help with regard to, uh, an additional code enforcement officer, even if it's someone on a temporary basis to help us go through this process.

586
00:46:22,141 --> 00:46:22,441
Thank you.

587
00:46:22,481 --> 00:46:23,202
Counselor Falco.

588
00:46:23,222 --> 00:46:25,683
Mr. Counselor, are you happy with that explanation?

589
00:46:26,604 --> 00:46:28,686
I am very happy with the explanation, Mr. President.

590
00:46:28,726 --> 00:46:29,486
Now move for approval.

591
00:46:29,566 --> 00:46:29,906
Thank you.

592
00:46:31,147 --> 00:46:32,048
Vice president mocks.

593
00:46:33,309 --> 00:46:34,270
Thank you, Mr. President.

594
00:46:34,570 --> 00:46:34,650
Um,

595
00:46:35,618 --> 00:46:36,578
I had the opportunity.

596
00:46:36,618 --> 00:46:40,479
I didn't intend the last meeting, but I attended the one prior to that.

597
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:48,521
And, uh, I just want to say that this subcommittee has done yeoman's work in putting together an ordinance that makes sense for our community.

598
00:46:48,541 --> 00:46:55,123
Uh, I know the city of Somerville and the city of Boston has, uh, an ordinance that's very similar to this.

599
00:46:55,823 --> 00:47:03,245
They also have a department of code enforcement that, uh, would make our department look peel in comparison.

600
00:47:03,745 --> 00:47:04,525
Uh, Mr. President,

601
00:47:05,164 --> 00:47:16,266
And the one concern I did have with this ordinance, and I don't see it addressed in the ordinance, and I brought it up at a meeting some time back, was the fact that

602
00:47:17,358 --> 00:47:44,728
Once we receive information from Tufts University that a list of, not student names, but where students are living with addresses, and once the city is on record that they are aware that there are a number of addresses that are in violation of our occupancy ordinance, which is no more than three unrelated people in an apartment, that requires us as a city to act.

603
00:47:45,845 --> 00:47:59,732
And as we heard tonight, and I've heard in the past, that we as a community probably do not have the capability to address all the issues that are gonna be confronted with this particular ordinance.

604
00:48:00,513 --> 00:48:12,519
And I have yet to see a list from Tufts University, and I'm not sure, it might be just a few cases that are clearly in violation of occupancy ordinance, but there may be,

605
00:48:13,512 --> 00:48:14,813
Hundreds, who knows?

606
00:48:15,273 --> 00:48:16,074
We don't know yet.

607
00:48:16,874 --> 00:48:27,200
And my question at the beginning was that Boston and Somerville don't put a timeframe on when the issue needs to be addressed.

608
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:40,748
But I think in our community with a depleted staff in our billing department, and in particular code enforcement, we need to put some type of timeframe so that we know when the city of Method gets this report,

609
00:48:41,609 --> 00:48:43,830
that they have to act within a period of time.

610
00:48:44,550 --> 00:49:03,898
I also believe if they don't act, Mr. President, that there could be potentially a liability issue on behalf of this city, because once we received the list from Tufts University, the city is on notice that a particular apartment is in violation of city ordinance, and they need to act, Mr. President.

611
00:49:04,398 --> 00:49:08,300
So I did request at the meeting that the subcommittee had

612
00:49:08,697 --> 00:49:10,459
some time back that we put a time frame.

613
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:22,435
It didn't find its way into the ordinance, which is fine, I'm not a member of that committee, but I still believe strongly to have an ordinance that's gonna work effectively in this community.

614
00:49:23,047 --> 00:49:25,909
And we don't create ordinances just for the sake of creating ordinances.

615
00:49:26,269 --> 00:49:35,454
We want to make sure this ordinance has the teeth to back up the concerns that we're trying to address by enacting this ordinance.

616
00:49:36,094 --> 00:49:42,558
So, I would ask, Mr. President, I know the residents are looking to push this forward, and I don't blame them.

617
00:49:42,578 --> 00:49:49,341
They've been dealing with issues of this type of issue for many years now.

618
00:49:49,401 --> 00:49:52,603
But I still think, at some point, we need to create

619
00:49:53,098 --> 00:50:00,167
some type of language in here that puts the city on notice and requires the city to act within a particular time frame.

620
00:50:00,447 --> 00:50:01,368
That's my first point.

621
00:50:01,849 --> 00:50:05,253
The second point is that under section 26-44,

622
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:33,404
section 5 it goes on to say that The information that we're receiving from Tufts University will be given to the city clerk and that will be forwarded to the mayor and the city and code enforcement The code enforcement officer it then goes on mr. President, and this is what I had a problem with several months back It says the clerk also should docket the report

623
00:50:33,912 --> 00:50:38,846
and include the docket on the agenda of the next occurring meeting of the city council.

624
00:50:39,967 --> 00:50:44,849
Now, I know there's no names associated with this, but I think there's a privacy issue.

625
00:50:45,409 --> 00:50:51,231
I don't think we should be putting on a public record where every off-campus tough student lives in the city of Method.

626
00:50:51,852 --> 00:50:53,212
I personally have a problem with that.

627
00:50:53,893 --> 00:51:07,758
I don't think, first of all, it's anyone's business, other than maybe code enforcement or someone that's the regulatory body, but I don't think we, as a community, should be publishing that in any type of record that goes out to this community.

628
00:51:08,252 --> 00:51:09,053
uh, Mr. President.

629
00:51:09,093 --> 00:51:19,201
So I would respectfully ask that, uh, the language be removed that States, uh, and, uh, section 26 dash 44 paragraph five.

630
00:51:19,782 --> 00:51:26,727
The clerk also shall dock at the report and include the docket on the agenda of the next occurring meeting of the city council.

631
00:51:27,828 --> 00:51:31,631
Um, so I would respectfully ask that that be removed, Mr. President.

632
00:51:32,252 --> 00:51:37,156
And just my last point, um, this is an issue.

633
00:51:38,737 --> 00:51:39,978
for the entire community.

634
00:51:40,938 --> 00:51:52,963
And I realize it's an issue up around Tufts University, but I can speak firsthand about issues that I see on my street alone of illegal apartments throughout the area.

635
00:51:53,503 --> 00:51:56,765
And it's not just on my street, it's throughout the entire community.

636
00:51:57,285 --> 00:52:00,827
And it's a real problem, Mr. President, that presents itself.

637
00:52:01,367 --> 00:52:05,909
And some communities are handling it by what they call a disclosure statement.

638
00:52:06,409 --> 00:52:26,685
So if you're going to lease your apartment or even if you sell your property and you're going to rent an apartment, whatever it might be, that you or the city creates a disclosure statement and you have to state who you're leasing to or renting to and that it conforms to the occupancy ordinance.

639
00:52:27,445 --> 00:52:29,447
And it's signed off by the owner of the property.

640
00:52:30,442 --> 00:52:33,104
And it goes on record, and they keep it on record.

641
00:52:33,684 --> 00:52:35,445
And I think it's an important tool.

642
00:52:35,786 --> 00:52:46,392
It may not solve all our problems with illegal apartments or too many people living in an apartment, but I think it goes a long way to address the issue as a citywide issue.

643
00:52:46,852 --> 00:52:53,876
Right now, we're addressing it as a university issue, and it is somewhat of a university issue.

644
00:52:54,177 --> 00:52:56,778
And I'd say the larger problem is citywide.

645
00:52:57,319 --> 00:52:59,620
And at some point, I'd like to see this council work on

646
00:53:00,827 --> 00:53:12,974
potentially moving forward a disclosure statement for anyone that's renting or leasing that would disclose the fact of how many people are in the apartment and sign off on that, Mr. President.

647
00:53:13,361 --> 00:53:15,841
So those are the two of the things that I'd like to see worked on.

648
00:53:16,922 --> 00:53:31,004
But immediately, I think if we remove that language in Section 26-44, I could support that tonight with that language removed and then potentially work on a timeframe down the line.

649
00:53:31,044 --> 00:53:41,526
We can always get together as a subcommittee and work on a timeframe to put some teeth into the ordinance regarding the city inspection, Mr. President, in a timely fashion.

650
00:53:42,466 --> 00:53:42,726
Thank you.

651
00:53:43,882 --> 00:53:44,803
Councilor DelaRusso.

652
00:53:46,004 --> 00:53:47,225
Mr. President, thank you.

653
00:53:47,505 --> 00:53:50,347
And I want to thank the members of the committee who have worked so hard on this.

654
00:53:50,928 --> 00:54:03,378
I think we had a draft ordinance or regulations presented to us some couple of years ago that never took off for whatever reason, and that this measure here is quite a good start.

655
00:54:04,039 --> 00:54:07,962
As my colleague to my right so aptly pointed out,

656
00:54:09,187 --> 00:54:18,777
an ordinance designed to deal with a particular situation in many ways, even though it's written in a manner that gives it broader scope to any university or college.

657
00:54:19,390 --> 00:54:20,471
that provides housing.

658
00:54:21,871 --> 00:54:27,594
He brings up a couple issues that I share and have me concerned.

659
00:54:27,754 --> 00:54:46,584
I attended the subcommittee meeting last week, but was only casual in my attendance and did not speak as to the substance of this, thinking that it would be, as procedure would mandate, brought to the committee of the whole for further decision.

660
00:54:50,294 --> 00:55:09,624
I'm concerned about placing a timeframe on the inspections as creating an undue burden on the inspectional services in the community and making it an almost too difficult of an ordinance to enforce.

661
00:55:10,784 --> 00:55:17,768
I share the council's concerns and see the point he's making, but I think that will need some further discussion

662
00:55:18,448 --> 00:55:22,556
with a member of the inspectional services present.

663
00:55:24,716 --> 00:55:32,738
I'm also concerned about the piece that the councilor is asking us tonight to delete from this.

664
00:55:34,198 --> 00:55:45,781
There was some discussion and I forget the substance of it, but the city solicitor made some salient points as to what we can conceal from the public and what we can't.

665
00:55:46,441 --> 00:55:54,203
And again, I think before we acted on that, it would be wise for us to have him present to guide us in that.

666
00:55:55,543 --> 00:56:21,250
I share the council's concerns about creating this list and allow it to be in the public Because then people can get it and it's identifying people for a particular nature or an occupation that they have and it allows them to be sought out and So I have some concerns there and So those would be two of my

667
00:56:23,139 --> 00:56:24,239
concerns that I have.

668
00:56:24,659 --> 00:56:39,008
And finally, as Councillor Marks so aptly pointed out again, which I wanted to bring up, is that this is not an issue confined to one neighbourhood in our city, nor is it an issue

669
00:56:39,967 --> 00:56:46,793
confined to one occupation or social subset within our community.

670
00:56:47,674 --> 00:56:55,682
There are people all over Metfit who are in overpopulated apartments and we can, one instance was,

671
00:57:00,025 --> 00:57:10,652
explained to us where there were some dozen people living in a reconfigured two-family, second-floor apartment in the city of Medford.

672
00:57:11,012 --> 00:57:11,773
That's alarming.

673
00:57:12,513 --> 00:57:21,999
They were living in virtual cubbyholes, like they were living in births in a Pullman car, and that was their only living space.

674
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:29,124
Very unsavory, very dangerous, and I'd describe it as

675
00:57:29,857 --> 00:57:30,357
primitive.

676
00:57:30,938 --> 00:57:44,926
Our housing codes and laws have come a long way from the hideous tenements in which the first people who arrived in our nation had to live in until they could establish themselves.

677
00:57:45,366 --> 00:57:48,388
And many of them died in those conditions, Mr. President.

678
00:57:49,143 --> 00:58:04,436
Um, this, uh, in this same question presents itself, uh, throughout, uh, uh, cities and towns, cities of particular, uh, adjacent to us, even those cities, which have very robustly populated inspectional divisions.

679
00:58:05,116 --> 00:58:17,146
So, um, uh, I think some sort of disclosure on the part of landlords would be helpful to explore and, uh, add me to some type of, uh, ordinance that we, uh,

680
00:58:18,145 --> 00:58:18,906
have in the future.

681
00:58:20,267 --> 00:58:24,692
I have concerns with this, as does my colleague to my right.

682
00:58:26,053 --> 00:58:36,503
I know that the neighbors, they express their desire to receive some relief and that this is an ordinance that will give them that relief.

683
00:58:37,023 --> 00:58:39,366
and that's important and I understand their concern.

684
00:58:39,927 --> 00:58:56,067
I see many of the, where I live so close to, where I live in a neighborhood that's populated by many students, I understand what goes on and I see it and I certainly see it at the end of each semester, the problems that present themselves.

685
00:58:56,447 --> 00:58:57,928
when people vacate these apartments.

686
00:58:58,409 --> 00:59:03,193
So, Mr. President, I don't know what I want to do with this.

687
00:59:03,833 --> 00:59:11,000
I'd prefer, Mr. President, that this — and I don't want to hold this up.

688
00:59:11,060 --> 00:59:20,688
It's not my intention to hold the work of this committee up, nor is it my intention to upset the neighbors who are suffering because of these —

689
00:59:22,918 --> 00:59:41,554
these incidents, but I'm wondering, uh, that it would be the wisest thing for us to address these issues that have been, uh, uh, presented here in this committee, in a committee of the whole meeting with, uh, Mr. Buvuso, uh, or Mr. Moki present and most certainly with the city solicitor present.

690
00:59:42,255 --> 00:59:42,555
Thank you.

691
00:59:42,575 --> 00:59:42,955
Councilor.

692
00:59:44,516 --> 00:59:45,437
Councilor Longo Kern.

693
00:59:46,338 --> 00:59:46,978
Um, thank you.

694
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:48,700
I just wanted to point out,

695
00:59:49,418 --> 00:59:54,502
I think that's fine, the deletion of 26.44-44.

696
00:59:54,543 --> 00:59:57,745
I think that is something we discussed back in August, so I understand.

697
00:59:58,406 --> 01:00:01,448
And I think my colleagues probably agree to strike that.

698
01:00:02,309 --> 01:00:08,454
I do know that John Bavuso said he has no ability to take this list and go and force everything.

699
01:00:08,494 --> 01:00:10,336
He just does not have enough time in the day.

700
01:00:10,396 --> 01:00:16,221
So I think that is something that we need to address down the line, and we need to request

701
01:00:18,683 --> 01:00:26,488
that the administration either hire him an intern, I think we talked about interns, or another part-time person to work on this.

702
01:00:26,909 --> 01:00:32,392
We also asked Tufts University to go back and discuss possibly helping in different ways.

703
01:00:32,472 --> 01:00:39,017
So I know we have, I'm sorry to bring you up here, but we have Miss Barbara Rubell from Tufts University here.

704
01:00:39,057 --> 01:00:45,241
Maybe she can come up and just see what, if they've had any talks in the last week and what Tufts is able to help with.

705
01:00:46,462 --> 01:00:46,642
Thanks.

706
01:00:46,662 --> 01:00:46,942
Thank you.

707
01:00:46,982 --> 01:00:48,043
Name and address of the record, please.

708
01:00:48,443 --> 01:00:53,927
Barbara Rubel, I'm Director of Community Relations at Tufts and 21 Bellevue in Medford.

709
01:00:58,471 --> 01:01:17,405
We were asked at that meeting last week to go back to the Dean of Students and others and see if we could do more to share with students to make sure they're aware of what the regulation is in Medford, that the city ordinances require that no more than three unrelated people live together in a unit.

710
01:01:18,125 --> 01:01:21,887
And we've begun that conversation, but we don't have an answer for you yet.

711
01:01:23,628 --> 01:01:39,255
But we recognize that anything we can do to make sure students are well informed when they go to look for apartments and when they sign leases would be helpful towards supporting the city's regulations and also their own personal safety.

712
01:01:40,242 --> 01:01:48,324
So we're willing to do that, we just have to, we have to, as you might imagine, we have to consult with a number of other people in the university before we can make that commitment.

713
01:01:49,745 --> 01:01:50,205
Thank you, ma'am.

714
01:01:54,126 --> 01:01:55,426
Councilor Luther, do you have any other questions?

715
01:01:55,526 --> 01:02:02,728
No, I just want to thank Mr. Bell for attending all the meetings and being there and hopefully having more conversation with regards to that.

716
01:02:02,748 --> 01:02:08,030
I'm all for one, to give people more time, but I think the main issue is striking that

717
01:02:08,773 --> 01:02:23,806
one sentence from 2644 and the other two issues with regards to enforcement, full enforcement of this ordinance, not just for what John Bavuso wants it for, and also talking about a new ordinance with regards to what Councilor Mark stated.

718
01:02:24,667 --> 01:02:32,273
John Bavuso said an ordinance to enforce all of our neighborhoods with regards to three or more people

719
01:02:32,713 --> 01:02:41,682
There is an ordinance out there with the disclosure statement, and that's something, you know, that's entirely different, separate from this, and that's something he would love to see us work on.

720
01:02:41,742 --> 01:02:48,889
So I do have an ordinance that I pulled up, and then I can forward to my colleagues if we could try to get that talked about at a later time.

721
01:02:48,909 --> 01:02:54,174
But other than that, I think this ordinance has been addressed, and I'm ready to move forward.

722
01:02:54,374 --> 01:02:56,076
I assume my colleagues feel.

723
01:02:57,230 --> 01:02:57,570
Thank you.

724
01:02:57,670 --> 01:02:58,311
Councilor Falco.

725
01:02:58,431 --> 01:02:59,312
Thank you, Mr. President.

726
01:02:59,452 --> 01:03:06,137
And I want to thank my colleagues for their input because it's very valuable and everyone should definitely give their opinion on this.

727
01:03:06,717 --> 01:03:09,780
Um, and it's, it's the ordinance.

728
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:12,682
I mean, I know myself, I feel like I'm ready to move forward as well.

729
01:03:13,362 --> 01:03:23,370
Um, and I understand, um, while there might be some apprehension, it's, it's interesting because it's really, it's a balance between public safety and, you know, having an anonymous list.

730
01:03:24,051 --> 01:03:29,896
But I did do some research with regard to the cities that also had this type of ordinance.

731
01:03:30,356 --> 01:03:35,680
And if you look at the city of Boston, if you look at the city of Somerville, the language is the same that we have here in this ordinance.

732
01:03:36,321 --> 01:03:45,088
And it's basically, you know, if I read the city of Somerville, it's the mayor of the city and the superintendent of office of inspectional services.

733
01:03:45,698 --> 01:03:52,404
The clerk also shall docket the report and include the docket on the agenda at the next occurring meeting of the Board of Aldermen.

734
01:03:52,564 --> 01:03:54,246
And it's the same thing for the City of Boston.

735
01:03:54,266 --> 01:03:58,029
So the language is exactly the same as it is here in the proposed ordinance.

736
01:03:58,089 --> 01:04:00,391
If you want to look at it, I can definitely send it down.

737
01:04:00,992 --> 01:04:12,382
And I believe during our meeting, when City Solicitor Rumley spoke, I believe he said, by nature of City Hall, any document that comes in here

738
01:04:13,197 --> 01:04:13,917
is public record.

739
01:04:14,578 --> 01:04:18,900
So that list that comes in is a matter of public record because we're receiving it.

740
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:19,941
It's here at city hall.

741
01:04:20,481 --> 01:04:23,603
Um, so it's, it, it is what it is.

742
01:04:23,643 --> 01:04:26,825
It's basically a public document that the public can't access.

743
01:04:27,645 --> 01:04:33,389
Um, because it's, it's by the nature of what we do here at city hall and it's, it's covered under the public record law.

744
01:04:36,170 --> 01:04:37,771
So I just wanted to clarify a few things.

745
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:38,312
Thank you.

746
01:04:38,712 --> 01:04:39,092
Thank you.

747
01:04:40,273 --> 01:04:40,773
Also a knife.

748
01:04:41,598 --> 01:04:44,499
Mr. President, at this time, I'd like to withdraw my motion for approval.

749
01:04:45,199 --> 01:04:50,501
I think that based upon the debate and discussion we've had here this evening, that there are certain individual councils that have some questions.

750
01:04:50,941 --> 01:04:54,502
And upon my further review of reading the proposed ordinance, I have some questions, too.

751
01:04:55,343 --> 01:05:08,387
For example, as we look into the violations section, it says that it's unlawful for many facility to fail to comply with these requirements, that each violation of the provision of this section is a separate and distinctive offense.

752
01:05:09,249 --> 01:05:16,491
In a case of continuing violation, each day that the violation continues constitutes a separate offense.

753
01:05:16,931 --> 01:05:21,532
The imposition of penalties herein shall not be precluded the city from instituting other remedies.

754
01:05:21,592 --> 01:05:24,033
So I have some concerns about that as well, Mr. President.

755
01:05:24,053 --> 01:05:31,074
I think that it would be good if the council as a whole had an opportunity to sit down and bounce some questions off the city solicitor and the building commissioner as well.

756
01:05:31,695 --> 01:05:33,015
I don't think that this is an

757
01:05:33,788 --> 01:05:35,109
effort to delay the matter at all.

758
01:05:35,169 --> 01:05:41,414
I think it's an effort to be sure that we put out an ordinance that's operational and that's strong and that actually meets its intent and its purpose.

759
01:05:42,255 --> 01:05:42,595
Thank you.

760
01:05:43,596 --> 01:05:44,336
Also Scott Pelley.

761
01:05:44,356 --> 01:05:47,138
Um, again, I appreciate that.

762
01:05:47,159 --> 01:05:56,546
It's something that I wanted to share with the council that the, and the community that we found very alarming that, uh, Barbara brought to our, our, um, our privy that,

763
01:05:57,180 --> 01:06:14,187
What we're seeing is our real estate agents really don't understand what our laws are in our community, because as they're moving forward and bringing residents in and renters in, they're actually pushing

764
01:06:15,095 --> 01:06:18,277
the more people, the better the rate would be in rent.

765
01:06:18,337 --> 01:06:36,488
So I think there's gotta be something too that we, I know that separately as part of a future discussion that we talk about making sure that we contact our real estate agents that are working within Medford and making sure they are familiar with our ordinances on residence requirements.

766
01:06:36,508 --> 01:06:38,549
So I just wanted to share that.

767
01:06:38,590 --> 01:06:41,711
I know that everybody has shared their information

768
01:06:42,712 --> 01:06:44,833
their input and I can respect it.

769
01:06:44,893 --> 01:07:09,186
I just, uh, again, I think this is, uh, something as a ad hoc committee that, um, works together and met with that city solicitor who, who, who asked, who asked us questions and we asked those prudent questions back and, um, and we, as this body's subcommittee, um, felt pretty strong in what we brought forward.

770
01:07:09,206 --> 01:07:09,526
So, but,

771
01:07:10,965 --> 01:07:12,366
can understand that we move forward.

772
01:07:12,386 --> 01:07:17,588
But I was ready to move forward with it as faith.

773
01:07:17,748 --> 01:07:18,088
Thank you.

774
01:07:18,328 --> 01:07:18,668
Thank you.

775
01:07:19,389 --> 01:07:20,289
Vice President Max.

776
01:07:21,189 --> 01:07:22,150
Thank you, Mr. President.

777
01:07:22,250 --> 01:07:38,137
And the reason why I brought up the section which dealt with reporting this information out on the council agenda was was not to hide information, because once this is sent from Tufts,

778
01:07:38,731 --> 01:07:41,474
to Mr Finn, it becomes public record.

779
01:07:42,414 --> 01:07:53,745
This ordinance takes it one step further and says it shall appear on the council agenda that by no means by appearing on the council agenda all of a sudden means it's a public document.

780
01:07:54,104 --> 01:07:59,587
It's already a public document once it arrives at City Hall and is in the clerk's office.

781
01:07:59,907 --> 01:08:01,248
That's when it's a public document.

782
01:08:01,268 --> 01:08:09,393
So putting it on the agenda has nothing to do with anything other than the fact that maybe Somerville and Boston wanted to put it on their agenda.

783
01:08:09,873 --> 01:08:18,358
I still feel strongly, Mr. President, that we should not be reporting addresses of students from Tufts where they live off campus.

784
01:08:18,698 --> 01:08:21,160
I feel strongly about that, Mr. President.

785
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:24,502
And I will not support an ordinance that has that language in it.

786
01:08:24,903 --> 01:08:35,291
And I thought at the time, Mr. President, that when I brought this issue up and Solicitor Rumley was in the room, I thought we were all in agreement saying, you know what, we can remove that language easily.

787
01:08:35,331 --> 01:08:38,954
And I'll be quite frank, I thought it was being removed.

788
01:08:39,514 --> 01:08:42,616
So I was kind of surprised when I read this over to see it's still in there.

789
01:08:42,656 --> 01:08:45,439
But again, I didn't go to the last meeting.

790
01:08:46,039 --> 01:08:50,963
And my last point, Mr. President, that if we're going to create an ordinance,

791
01:08:51,499 --> 01:09:03,050
that residents want to see and feel that it's going to assist them in providing some relief in their neighborhood, it has to include some teeth to it.

792
01:09:03,810 --> 01:09:05,612
And, you know, I can see what's going to happen.

793
01:09:05,952 --> 01:09:07,233
We push through an ordinance.

794
01:09:09,215 --> 01:09:16,242
Neighbors call up and say, hey, I noticed that the house next door to me is on your list for having more than three unrelated people.

795
01:09:17,563 --> 01:09:18,484
When are you going to get to it?

796
01:09:19,765 --> 01:09:20,706
Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am.

797
01:09:20,987 --> 01:09:22,609
We're tied up for the next eight months.

798
01:09:23,310 --> 01:09:24,893
We may not be able to get to it right now.

799
01:09:25,333 --> 01:09:25,814
What do you mean?

800
01:09:25,854 --> 01:09:26,615
We have an ordinance.

801
01:09:27,256 --> 01:09:34,326
The ordinance does nothing to the effect, Mr. President, which would put this city on notice to get out to the House.

802
01:09:34,707 --> 01:09:38,010
I'm not saying they have to go out the next day, but we have to set a time.

803
01:09:38,350 --> 01:09:52,622
For this to work, we have to set a timeframe, because if we don't set a timeframe, we're going to be back at step one again with an ordinance that has no teeth, Mr. President, a department that has lax in manpower, that can't address these issues.

804
01:09:53,832 --> 01:10:01,902
And maybe if we put a time frame on it, we'll force the hand of the administration to hire another code enforcement officer, which is sorely needed.

805
01:10:02,182 --> 01:10:11,933
I appreciate what Councilor De La Ruza mentioned, but even having another code enforcement officer in a city this size, we're still severely undermanned in that department.

806
01:10:12,854 --> 01:10:14,215
And we hear it over and over again.

807
01:10:14,255 --> 01:10:15,136
It's not me saying it.

808
01:10:15,436 --> 01:10:17,138
It's the people in the department saying it.

809
01:10:17,618 --> 01:10:21,841
So, you know, we could push the audience forward without a time frame in there.

810
01:10:21,881 --> 01:10:23,823
The city must address these issues.

811
01:10:24,463 --> 01:10:32,470
But honestly, I think we're doing the neighborhood and the people of this community injustice because it doesn't address their issue, Mr. President.

812
01:10:32,990 --> 01:10:34,531
So, those are my comments.

813
01:10:35,131 --> 01:10:52,437
Like I said, I will vote for this tonight with that language taken out about appearing on the city agenda, city council agenda, and at a future date if we want to put a time frame on this, you know, I think we can go back and do it.

814
01:10:52,757 --> 01:11:01,060
So, I'm not going to hold it up for that, but I think in order to have a meaningful piece of legislation, it has to include a time frame.

815
01:11:02,020 --> 01:11:02,300
Thank you.

816
01:11:03,152 --> 01:11:04,153
Councilor De La Rosa.

817
01:11:05,053 --> 01:11:31,932
Mr. President, I move that a Committee of the Whole meeting be held, called with the city solicitor and code enforcement officer to discuss this paper before us and that this paper be sent to Committee of the Whole for further consideration to clean it up, come to agreement so that we can present an ordinance that's gonna help the community.

818
01:11:32,112 --> 01:11:32,412
Thank you.

819
01:11:33,003 --> 01:11:33,964
Name and address of the record, please.

820
01:11:34,424 --> 01:11:37,726
Uh, Barbara Rubel, community relations at Tufts through the chair.

821
01:11:37,787 --> 01:11:40,148
I just wanted to clarify one point.

822
01:11:40,809 --> 01:11:57,761
Um, the ordinance says based on my experience submitting these reports to the city of Boston and to the city of Somerville, um, the, the, um, issue at the end where it says there's a fine or there could be a penalty is really to find the university.

823
01:11:58,182 --> 01:12:00,083
If the report is not submitted on time.

824
01:12:00,645 --> 01:12:11,211
And I think the reference to putting it on the agenda of the respective local government board is just to acknowledge that the report was submitted on time.

825
01:12:11,231 --> 01:12:20,896
Um, in my experience with Somerville, anyway, the report has never been discussed on the agenda of the board of aldermen or presented publicly.

826
01:12:20,936 --> 01:12:23,897
There's no, while the document does, you're absolutely right.

827
01:12:23,937 --> 01:12:25,478
It does become public.

828
01:12:26,358 --> 01:12:27,019
One information.

829
01:12:29,139 --> 01:12:30,260
I appreciate that fact.

830
01:12:30,781 --> 01:12:32,043
We're a legislative body.

831
01:12:32,483 --> 01:12:34,285
We're not the enforcement body.

832
01:12:34,666 --> 01:12:37,549
So the people that would be finding isn't this council.

833
01:12:37,930 --> 01:12:42,495
So to be quite frank with that, I don't care if the report came a day early a day late, it's not up to me.

834
01:12:42,795 --> 01:12:44,237
It would be up to code enforcement.

835
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:46,984
in that arm of city government.

836
01:12:47,364 --> 01:12:50,806
So to have it on our agenda is meaningless, to be quite frank with you.

837
01:12:51,226 --> 01:12:55,168
And whether Boston does it or Somerville, I don't think we should just follow suit.

838
01:12:55,628 --> 01:12:56,669
I just wanted to explain.

839
01:12:56,689 --> 01:12:56,969
Thank you.

840
01:12:57,269 --> 01:12:57,549
I know.

841
01:12:57,609 --> 01:13:02,772
But I don't see Boston or Somerville as any better legislative body than this body.

842
01:13:03,252 --> 01:13:05,453
And I'm not going to just follow suit what they do.

843
01:13:06,634 --> 01:13:09,315
With all due respect, I didn't mean to suggest that there was any.

844
01:13:09,715 --> 01:13:10,276
I know you didn't.

845
01:13:10,656 --> 01:13:12,977
I just wanted to explain why I think that's there.

846
01:13:13,582 --> 01:13:16,763
And that is what Somerville requested, what Boston requested.

847
01:13:16,803 --> 01:13:21,125
You certainly are within your rights to take it out or leave it in as you choose.

848
01:13:21,385 --> 01:13:21,545
Right.

849
01:13:22,005 --> 01:13:22,346
Thank you.

850
01:13:23,786 --> 01:13:24,386
Councillor Nice.

851
01:13:25,027 --> 01:13:27,188
Mr. President, motion to end debate on the topic.

852
01:13:27,688 --> 01:13:28,008
Thank you.

853
01:13:30,953 --> 01:13:31,954
Name and address of the record, please.

854
01:13:32,134 --> 01:13:36,717
President, my name is Robert Pence, zero summit road, and that's what mass from a member of the sluggish party.

855
01:13:36,737 --> 01:13:40,180
Uh, there might be a compromise to this situation that's being presented.

856
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:55,051
So I know the committee did some hard work and I know this has been a subject matter of concern when I was serving on the council, but maybe rather than having the idea of submitting a document to the city clerk, um, I think you need to look at this at two points.

857
01:13:55,111 --> 01:13:58,373
Number one, what the university does on its own land,

858
01:13:58,905 --> 01:14:03,087
with its own campus provisos for the students, it's no interest of us.

859
01:14:03,927 --> 01:14:18,054
But what they do off-campus by having off-campus locations for people to provide those locations is a concern to the city, and I believe the concern to the city should be placed on the homeowner or the landowner of where these students might be.

860
01:14:18,674 --> 01:14:20,895
Councilor Marks alluded to the idea of a violation.

861
01:14:21,555 --> 01:14:27,478
If in fact you get a document that gives you these locations of where these students are, I think it's incumbent

862
01:14:27,805 --> 01:14:40,751
for the purposes of enforcement and having your teeth on the landowner who's collecting the rent from that student to have that student who's going to Tufts University be one of the students that's sitting in an off-campus position.

863
01:14:41,511 --> 01:14:49,635
I think that could bring you to the compromise of saying, rather than having your code enforcement officer go out, it's upon the landowner.

864
01:14:49,715 --> 01:14:54,337
And once that landowner is found in violation, then the city has its own teeth.

865
01:14:55,051 --> 01:15:06,700
I don't think anybody of you were on the council at the time, but we can go back a few years ago, and I think Barbara will remember this, where there was a student living in the garage roof in a particular location off campus.

866
01:15:07,260 --> 01:15:22,572
And I think that there was a huge settlement, and to the hundreds and thousands of dollars, I believe to the family of the student, unfortunately, who died there, but it was the city's responsibility, or should have been the city's responsibility, if we follow this train of thought, that the location did not provide

867
01:15:22,872 --> 01:15:25,532
the safety and the security for that particular person.

868
01:15:25,933 --> 01:15:27,593
I offer that out as a compromise.

869
01:15:27,653 --> 01:15:44,056
I think it would work, and I think it would be beneficial not only to all you folks, but to the community as a whole, because you're now putting everybody on notice that if you are going to take in campus students or off-college students off-campus, it's going to be their responsibility to adhere to all the rules and the regulations.

870
01:15:44,376 --> 01:15:48,676
And any violation would be found right in the teeth of the, excuse me, in the teeth of the ordinance.

871
01:15:49,356 --> 01:15:52,297
And I think that's satisfied making the presentation before the clerk.

872
01:15:52,737 --> 01:15:56,659
They make the presentation to the city building department on an annual basis.

873
01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:00,162
And from there, the city is on notice where these locations might be.

874
01:16:00,362 --> 01:16:02,883
And then it doesn't become a, a matter of public record.

875
01:16:03,264 --> 01:16:08,667
It becomes a matter of a public safety issue that the building department has the responsibility for.

876
01:16:09,287 --> 01:16:11,068
So I offer that out there as a compromise.

877
01:16:12,529 --> 01:16:13,190
Councilor Lococo.

878
01:16:14,150 --> 01:16:14,891
I move approval.

879
01:16:14,911 --> 01:16:21,395
Do you want to move approval that we, the paper be referred to the council of whole council for further discussion?

880
01:16:21,943 --> 01:16:24,484
a motion for the paper to be take its first reading.

881
01:16:24,524 --> 01:16:27,125
It's first reading also night.

882
01:16:27,585 --> 01:16:38,309
Um, Mr. President, where the council rules clearly say that the council president shall review the papers of the subcommittee and the committee of the whole meeting and the debate has been contentious.

883
01:16:38,390 --> 01:16:46,373
I think that, um, at this point in time it would be prudent course to refer the matter to the committee of the whole and would motion a contrary motion, uh, the matter be referred to the committee of the whole.

884
01:16:46,693 --> 01:16:47,033
I concur.

885
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:52,702
On the motion that we send this, we adopt this paper and we send it to the committee of whole for further review.

886
01:17:00,867 --> 01:17:02,128
No, no, no, no.

887
01:17:02,168 --> 01:17:05,409
Send it, send it, send it right to the committee.

888
01:17:05,429 --> 01:17:08,891
The whole heart goes to frustrating on council.

889
01:17:08,931 --> 01:17:14,474
Don Russell made a motion that we, that we send the paper to the council hall for further discussion.

890
01:17:14,915 --> 01:17:15,575
All those in favor.

891
01:17:17,841 --> 01:17:19,582
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

892
01:17:30,811 --> 01:17:31,711
Councilor Dela Russo.

893
01:17:32,112 --> 01:17:32,392
Yes.

894
01:17:33,012 --> 01:17:33,693
Councilor Falco.

895
01:17:33,813 --> 01:17:34,033
No.

896
01:17:35,314 --> 01:17:35,894
Councilor Knight.

897
01:17:35,954 --> 01:17:36,235
Yes.

898
01:17:37,175 --> 01:17:37,856
Councilor Long-Term.

899
01:17:37,896 --> 01:17:37,976
No.

900
01:17:39,057 --> 01:17:39,877
Vice President Mox.

901
01:17:40,358 --> 01:17:40,578
Yes.

902
01:17:41,158 --> 01:17:42,019
Councilor Scarpelli.

903
01:17:42,219 --> 01:17:42,539
No.

904
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:44,241
President Kaviolik.

905
01:17:44,501 --> 01:17:44,781
Yes.

906
01:17:46,542 --> 01:17:47,023
The vote of.

907
01:17:48,557 --> 01:17:51,079
Four in the affirmative, three in the negative, motion passes.

908
01:17:54,381 --> 01:17:55,041
Councilor Falco.

909
01:17:56,422 --> 01:18:04,187
Since this has been referred to committee the whole, could we do our best to move this to committee the whole soon?

910
01:18:04,227 --> 01:18:05,468
I will, I will do my best.

911
01:18:05,528 --> 01:18:08,029
I will look, we have some other things in the council hall.

912
01:18:09,090 --> 01:18:11,972
I will do my best to get it there as quick as possible.

913
01:18:12,132 --> 01:18:12,472
Thank you.

914
01:18:13,052 --> 01:18:17,075
And if we haven't maybe on a, I know we'd have to have it maybe another night, but do the best we can.

915
01:18:18,820 --> 01:18:31,284
Mr. President, I know the matter has been disposed of, but I want to once again state that my intention in moving this to Committee of the Whole was in no way to delay this any further.

916
01:18:31,705 --> 01:18:43,249
But where there was such a significant delay, and this is such a significant ordinance, I think we would be well advised to have the presence of pertinent parties in a further discussion.

917
01:18:44,409 --> 01:18:46,350
So I understand that

918
01:18:48,678 --> 01:18:56,541
uh, handful of neighbors who were present at that meeting, uh, uh, pressed upon the committee members, uh, to act swiftly.

919
01:18:56,961 --> 01:18:58,782
But I think prudence dictates otherwise.

920
01:18:58,902 --> 01:18:59,262
Thank you.

921
01:19:00,223 --> 01:19:01,183
Councilor Longo.

922
01:19:01,523 --> 01:19:07,925
While we're on the suspension, Councilor Longo-Kern.

923
01:19:07,945 --> 01:19:08,246
17-055.

924
01:19:08,266 --> 01:19:08,286
17-055.

925
01:19:08,546 --> 01:19:13,207
While we're on suspension, 17-055 offered by Councilor Longo-Kern.

926
01:19:13,868 --> 01:19:14,668
Be it resolved.

927
01:19:15,305 --> 01:19:20,087
When a blatant mistake is made by Park Medford, the ticket will be immediately voided.

928
01:19:20,107 --> 01:19:26,469
It's bad enough that one has to take the time out of their busy schedule to go to Park Medford office and let them know of their mistake.

929
01:19:27,510 --> 01:19:32,072
They should not have to fill out the appeal paperwork and waste more time at a hearing.

930
01:19:32,472 --> 01:19:33,492
Counselor Lungo-Kern.

931
01:19:34,293 --> 01:19:44,977
Thank you, President Carviello, and thank you for setting up a meeting with Park Medford, which will be held next Tuesday at 5.30 in room 207 for anybody that wants to attend.

932
01:19:46,152 --> 01:19:56,820
I think we've all sent a number of questions that we have for Park Medford, and I know that there'll be an hour and a half discussion with them with regards to a number of things on Tuesday night, next Tuesday night.

933
01:19:57,601 --> 01:20:14,753
But I brought this up, different issues with regards to Park Medford the last couple weeks, and I'm bringing it up again because every time I do bring it up, I get more calls and more emails with regards to people that are unhappy for certain reasons or people that have other stories that they want to tell on how they feel things aren't going

934
01:20:15,248 --> 01:20:18,350
the way they should, and it really caught my attention.

935
01:20:18,410 --> 01:20:23,234
I did get one call with regards to somebody that had got five separate tickets.

936
01:20:23,314 --> 01:20:31,921
This wasn't within the last three weeks where we've been noticing a serious problem, but it has been within the last six to nine months.

937
01:20:32,601 --> 01:20:36,805
They got five tickets for not having a permit, when in fact they did have a permit.

938
01:20:36,845 --> 01:20:43,590
So five different times they had to go to the Park Medfit office, fill out the necessary paperwork,

939
01:20:44,242 --> 01:20:47,264
and then go for an appeal.

940
01:20:47,284 --> 01:21:12,197
And I just feel like maybe it's something we will discuss next week, but I feel like if there is a blatant violation or blatant improper ticket that is issued, whether that be, I got a ticket at 10 o'clock and I paid the meter at 9.30 for one hour, or I have a parking permit, I got a ticket for not having a parking permit, simple, blatant mistakes

941
01:21:12,888 --> 01:21:15,110
maybe whether there be a list of different things.

942
01:21:15,670 --> 01:21:28,780
I think each person that works in that Park Medford office should be trained to say, we apologize, give me the ticket, let me take some proof, and this ticket will now be voided.

943
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:41,670
I feel like to make somebody go, we have working families in Medford, and to make somebody take time and go to the Park Medford from nine to five to fill out the paperwork and then wait for an appeal

944
01:21:42,107 --> 01:21:47,011
come to City Hall and have to sit through an appeal is a true waste of somebody's time.

945
01:21:47,351 --> 01:21:52,315
Nevermind having to do it for this person, one person that called five separate times.

946
01:21:53,316 --> 01:21:57,659
There's obviously something going wrong in Park Medford that's been discussed the last few weeks.

947
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:09,649
This is just something else I wanted to offer that I think would be very beneficial to the system as a whole and to our residents who are parking on our streets trying to traverse our businesses.

948
01:22:10,193 --> 01:22:12,775
I think it's something necessary that needs to be implemented.

949
01:22:13,195 --> 01:22:24,782
And like I said last week, somebody from the mayor's office has to oversee changes, and this is one that would be of great interest to many residents, especially those who are getting tickets unnecessarily.

950
01:22:25,722 --> 01:22:30,405
So this goes along with all my complaints over the last few weeks, and hopefully it will be discussed next week.

951
01:22:30,886 --> 01:22:39,711
And I just would ask for your approval so that we can go in next week saying this council approved 7.0, the blatant incorrect,

952
01:22:40,497 --> 01:22:45,781
tickets should be automatically voided with us either with, with showing of proof.

953
01:22:46,522 --> 01:22:53,228
Um, that's, that's something that I think is a no brainer and that is going to improve this whole system dramatically.

954
01:22:58,052 --> 01:22:58,372
Thank you.

955
01:23:01,635 --> 01:23:02,615
Name and address for the record.

956
01:23:03,196 --> 01:23:05,017
Robert Pinto zero summit road metron mass.

957
01:23:05,418 --> 01:23:08,060
It's quite obvious that this is not a new topic before this council.

958
01:23:08,571 --> 01:23:17,294
When I had served on this council some years back, I mean, this topic when Park Method first came in, had many, many flaws and many, many, how can you say?

959
01:23:17,694 --> 01:23:19,335
Many things did not make people happy.

960
01:23:20,756 --> 01:23:25,137
We have heard week after week that there are concerns that need to be addressed.

961
01:23:25,157 --> 01:23:26,918
Councilor Longo-Kern has just brought up a few.

962
01:23:27,438 --> 01:23:32,920
But you also have the ones that basically tell you that common sense needs to take place.

963
01:23:34,121 --> 01:23:37,282
Two particular instances, a gentleman with a handicapped plate

964
01:23:38,490 --> 01:23:42,993
gets parked in the spot, provided for handicap and gets a ticket.

965
01:23:43,674 --> 01:23:46,215
And the argument is you were there more than the two hours.

966
01:23:46,796 --> 01:23:52,260
Now there is nothing in any of these rules that say a handicapped person is relegated to two hours.

967
01:23:53,481 --> 01:23:56,122
Person goes down to Park Medford, explains the case.

968
01:23:56,142 --> 01:23:57,664
It doesn't make any difference.

969
01:23:57,704 --> 01:23:59,025
You have to go and do an appeal.

970
01:23:59,945 --> 01:24:00,586
That's number one.

971
01:24:01,006 --> 01:24:03,848
Number two, something similar to Councilor Lungo Kern alluded to,

972
01:24:04,323 --> 01:24:05,484
There was a lady in Medford Square.

973
01:24:05,544 --> 01:24:08,165
She came with her baby, parked her car.

974
01:24:08,606 --> 01:24:12,968
Now, in some of these locations, you'll know there may be two or three or even four car lengths apart.

975
01:24:13,849 --> 01:24:18,892
So she parked maybe approximately four car lengths ahead of where the meter stand was.

976
01:24:19,592 --> 01:24:20,593
She gets out of the car.

977
01:24:21,614 --> 01:24:24,976
She hasn't even got to go get her ticket and come back.

978
01:24:25,476 --> 01:24:28,318
And the gentleman is there giving her a ticket, OK?

979
01:24:28,378 --> 01:24:31,840
And while she's giving the ticket, she said, I'm just, I had to go get the,

980
01:24:32,584 --> 01:24:34,245
had to go pay the meter to park the ticket.

981
01:24:34,305 --> 01:24:35,586
Doesn't make any difference, you don't have a ticket.

982
01:24:36,286 --> 01:24:39,228
Now, it's the common courtesy of common sense understanding.

983
01:24:39,709 --> 01:24:51,876
And I think it was you, Councilor Marks, that might have alluded to in the beginning, there should be some sense of maybe of a 15 minute leeway when somebody goes to go and park, by the time they go park their car, go get a ticket and what have you.

984
01:24:51,916 --> 01:24:55,779
I don't see anywhere, anything that even says that.

985
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:59,521
The position that I think you folks have should be the following.

986
01:24:59,541 --> 01:25:02,003
You know, the company's been sold,

987
01:25:02,430 --> 01:25:03,731
It's a new company that's come in.

988
01:25:04,772 --> 01:25:09,155
I think you folks have asked for a copy of the contract and I don't think you've gotten the contract yet.

989
01:25:09,756 --> 01:25:12,918
It's been well over a year and you haven't even gotten a copy of the financials.

990
01:25:13,919 --> 01:25:15,100
How many tickets have been issued?

991
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:16,501
How many tickets have been resolved?

992
01:25:16,962 --> 01:25:18,483
You know, how much money's coming in?

993
01:25:19,844 --> 01:25:22,486
Where did the $250,000 in the first year, where did that go?

994
01:25:22,786 --> 01:25:25,588
City hasn't even reported back to you on where that might be.

995
01:25:26,049 --> 01:25:31,033
I think Park Method has done quite a bit on this new parking scheme to really hurt

996
01:25:32,079 --> 01:25:34,841
to hurt the taxpayers and the business people of this community.

997
01:25:35,541 --> 01:25:42,225
We've been told that seniors can park for nothing, but you have to pay $25 to park for nothing to get the permit for once a year.

998
01:25:42,726 --> 01:25:47,569
And you can't transfer it from one car to another, which, again, doesn't help a senior in that particular case.

999
01:25:47,889 --> 01:25:53,413
You can go down to Haines Square any time in the morning, and you can see just many, many more blank spaces than there have ever been before.

1000
01:25:53,453 --> 01:25:56,294
Go to Meffitt Square in the morning, and the same situation happens.

1001
01:25:57,055 --> 01:26:00,377
I think the problem here is that Park Meffitt is just not doing

1002
01:26:00,831 --> 01:26:07,047
for the city as what the city thought it would do for its taxpayers and more importantly for its business people.

1003
01:26:07,708 --> 01:26:17,895
So I would suggest when you folks have your Committee of the Whole next meeting, I think it would be more appropriate to have a subsequent meeting here before the council where all the taxpayers can hear and see what's going on.

1004
01:26:18,055 --> 01:26:22,958
Because a lot of people can't come to a Committee of the Whole meeting or a subcommittee meeting for whatever you want to call it.

1005
01:26:23,438 --> 01:26:24,479
This is their public forum.

1006
01:26:24,519 --> 01:26:27,961
This is something that has an impact on the entire city of Medford.

1007
01:26:28,021 --> 01:26:36,607
Every single business person and every single person that drives through this community has to be confronted with those stupid kiosks where you're supposed to go and pay, okay?

1008
01:26:37,467 --> 01:26:39,988
with situations as Council Member O'Connor had.

1009
01:26:40,248 --> 01:26:46,969
You had a lady who gave me her ticket, and she had 10 minutes left on her ticket, and she still got a parking violation.

1010
01:26:47,310 --> 01:26:55,532
And having to go, having to go give up her time, having to take time off from work, which means it could possibly be paid, vacation time, what have you.

1011
01:26:55,772 --> 01:26:56,432
This isn't right.

1012
01:26:56,752 --> 01:27:07,776
And with the age of computer technology that we have here right now, if they can't resolve something that simple by going into the Park Medford office that can be resolved, this doesn't make any sense at all.

1013
01:27:07,896 --> 01:27:17,319
I think it's an insult to the taxpayers and it's an insult to this council who unfortunately has to bear the burden of all these complaints because this is the situation that you're in right now.

1014
01:27:18,820 --> 01:27:19,120
Thank you.

1015
01:27:23,910 --> 01:27:24,850
Name and address of the record.

1016
01:27:25,411 --> 01:27:25,851
Good evening.

1017
01:27:26,411 --> 01:27:29,812
Joseph Villione, 59 Garfield Avenue, Medford Mass.

1018
01:27:31,193 --> 01:27:46,019
To better monitor parking tickets and their alleged value to our city, I propose that Republic Parking, or the new name for whatever, be ordered to publish a list of dates and addresses where tickets are issued.

1019
01:27:46,839 --> 01:27:50,121
No names, but just list the fees.

1020
01:27:50,141 --> 01:27:50,121
$25, $40, $50.

1021
01:27:54,183 --> 01:28:05,633
and how much goes to Chattanooga, Tennessee, and how much money goes to Medford, Massachusetts, so that we people, we the citizens of Medford, will have a better idea because there's no clarity on this.

1022
01:28:06,074 --> 01:28:09,737
All we know is all of a sudden from out of nowhere this Frankenstein's monster erupted.

1023
01:28:10,933 --> 01:28:12,595
And I pay $0.25 into it.

1024
01:28:12,736 --> 01:28:19,726
I pay every week in Somerville when I do my radio show, I pay $0.25 over near Donato's office once because I had to go to the hardware store.

1025
01:28:20,226 --> 01:28:20,767
I walk.

1026
01:28:21,869 --> 01:28:23,952
I just refuse to pay to this system.

1027
01:28:24,977 --> 01:28:25,918
We need some clarity.

1028
01:28:26,198 --> 01:28:40,426
They should publish a website, and on that website we know every ticket that's issued, if it's been reversed, how much money it was, what address it was, and then we can monitor them instead of them monitoring us.

1029
01:28:40,746 --> 01:28:42,868
We are not cattle to feed this piggy bank.

1030
01:28:43,951 --> 01:28:46,032
I don't think it is of any value to Medford.

1031
01:28:46,632 --> 01:29:04,598
You know, we have 600 grand for public access hidden away, we got water and sewer, and all of a sudden now there's this new monstrosity where our money goes out, and we have no idea, citizens have no idea what's going on, and we got what, 13 people were here at the city council, now we're down to nine, last week was 14.

1032
01:29:04,638 --> 01:29:06,479
60,000 people need to rise up,

1033
01:29:09,055 --> 01:29:10,617
They need to watch these broadcasts.

1034
01:29:10,637 --> 01:29:12,259
They need to come down here and complain.

1035
01:29:12,299 --> 01:29:14,561
They need to be there at room 207 next week.

1036
01:29:15,803 --> 01:29:16,123
Thank you.

1037
01:29:21,137 --> 01:29:21,978
Name and address for the record.

1038
01:29:22,358 --> 01:29:23,579
Hi, Cheryl Rodriguez.

1039
01:29:23,699 --> 01:29:24,920
I live at 281 Park Street.

1040
01:29:25,581 --> 01:29:28,243
It seems that we have a lot of issues with Park Medford.

1041
01:29:28,663 --> 01:29:31,305
I know that when we first installed it, we couldn't read the screens.

1042
01:29:31,405 --> 01:29:32,706
We had a lot of broken meters.

1043
01:29:33,107 --> 01:29:36,850
We were supposed to have free Saturdays in December and the meters were taking money.

1044
01:29:36,890 --> 01:29:39,132
The meters were taking money at seven and eight o'clock at night.

1045
01:29:39,712 --> 01:29:41,594
Those are all contract breaches.

1046
01:29:42,254 --> 01:29:49,280
So everyone says we can't take out the meters because it'd be a breach of contract and we'd have to pay a million dollars to have the meters taken out.

1047
01:29:49,707 --> 01:29:53,751
But is there a point that Park Medford is breaching the contract and we can get out?

1048
01:29:54,191 --> 01:29:57,133
I feel like there are more negatives to Park Medford than positives.

1049
01:29:57,754 --> 01:30:00,196
As someone else said, when you go down to Haynes Square, it's a ghost town.

1050
01:30:00,757 --> 01:30:11,226
I talk to people that I used to meet for coffee at the Dunkin' Donuts down there and they say, let's go somewhere where we don't have to pay to park because it's just not worth it to pay and linger over a cup of coffee and have to worry about the meter.

1051
01:30:11,746 --> 01:30:14,088
So, I mean, this is definitely hurting our businesses.

1052
01:30:14,168 --> 01:30:15,229
It's hurting our citizens.

1053
01:30:16,070 --> 01:30:20,034
If all you have to do is go on Facebook to see people talking about, let's not go there, let's not go there.

1054
01:30:20,714 --> 01:30:28,682
And I really would like to see the opinion from the city solicitor on whether we can break this contract because of all the problems that we've had.

1055
01:30:29,202 --> 01:30:34,327
Because I think that if we want meters that maybe this isn't the way to go and we need to look at it again.

1056
01:30:34,347 --> 01:30:35,448
Thank you.

1057
01:30:41,550 --> 01:30:41,970
Good evening.

1058
01:30:42,470 --> 01:30:43,511
My name is Stacy Stewart.

1059
01:30:43,531 --> 01:30:46,072
I live at 106 Harvard Street here in Medford.

1060
01:30:46,532 --> 01:30:48,693
I've been a Medford resident for about 23 years.

1061
01:30:49,013 --> 01:30:50,194
I'm a self-employed attorney.

1062
01:30:50,214 --> 01:30:50,934
I work out of my home.

1063
01:30:51,674 --> 01:30:55,496
I've had my UPS delivery box at Riverside Avenue since I opened my practice.

1064
01:30:55,596 --> 01:30:56,356
I just closed it.

1065
01:30:56,376 --> 01:30:58,417
A big part of the reason was to park Medford.

1066
01:30:59,238 --> 01:31:04,080
I parked on the street and the meter was out of order.

1067
01:31:05,173 --> 01:31:11,018
and unreadable, and I left a note on my windshield showing the error message that I got.

1068
01:31:11,318 --> 01:31:13,039
I sent the appeal.

1069
01:31:13,580 --> 01:31:17,763
The ticket that I got actually on my window said the address, the zip code was 02115.

1070
01:31:18,423 --> 01:31:23,888
It wasn't even the correct address for Park Medford for me to even send the violation fee to.

1071
01:31:24,628 --> 01:31:29,312
I did dispute it, put the correct address, correct zip code, since I know that Medford only has one.

1072
01:31:30,424 --> 01:31:33,187
was immediately denied, and I was told there were other kiosks.

1073
01:31:33,807 --> 01:31:39,453
On that side of Riverside Avenue, between the CVS and the health station, there is one on that side.

1074
01:31:40,234 --> 01:31:45,780
Nowhere else in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts do I have to cross a busy street to pay a parking kiosk.

1075
01:31:45,820 --> 01:31:46,861
They're all over Boston.

1076
01:31:46,901 --> 01:31:48,362
I'm in Suffolk Probate Court all the time.

1077
01:31:48,723 --> 01:31:50,705
There are multiples of them along the street.

1078
01:31:51,132 --> 01:31:52,933
If one's not working, you can go to another one.

1079
01:31:52,974 --> 01:31:54,255
It's a couple of car lengths away.

1080
01:31:54,355 --> 01:31:55,656
I don't have to cross a street.

1081
01:31:56,016 --> 01:32:00,379
It's not intuitive that I would cross a street to pay a fee for that side of the street.

1082
01:32:00,820 --> 01:32:07,565
There's nothing, no signage on the meters themselves, nothing to indicate that there are alternative pay stations.

1083
01:32:07,625 --> 01:32:09,086
I think it's very poorly managed.

1084
01:32:09,586 --> 01:32:12,329
I don't like the tone of the letter was a flat-out denial.

1085
01:32:12,849 --> 01:32:17,493
As Councillor Keene has addressed, perhaps Park Medford needs to

1086
01:32:18,726 --> 01:32:40,957
Perhaps do some do some training with their staff in terms of handling things And as I said, I've had my UPS box at the Riverside Avenue station since 2008 it is now I have now moved it to Somerville I will no longer be doing business at the CVS when I run in to pick up my mail I will no longer be buying lunch up across the street from in Medford Square I will now be doing business in Davis Square and a big part of that is Park Medford.

1087
01:32:41,377 --> 01:32:42,898
I hope it gets addressed Thank you.

1088
01:32:42,918 --> 01:32:47,300
Thank you On the motion

1089
01:32:48,328 --> 01:32:49,689
Mr. President.

1090
01:32:50,770 --> 01:32:50,890
Yes.

1091
01:32:50,930 --> 01:32:51,411
Mr. President.

1092
01:32:52,812 --> 01:32:53,112
Thank you.

1093
01:32:53,192 --> 01:32:55,434
I, I thank a council member for bringing this up.

1094
01:32:55,534 --> 01:33:00,538
And, um, that's, this is a big part of the reason we're having the meeting next week, uh, with park Medford.

1095
01:33:01,138 --> 01:33:10,185
Um, but I see it as part of the biggest problem they have is, uh, they, uh, have, uh, minimal training of the people that they hire.

1096
01:33:10,526 --> 01:33:16,050
There's been a lot of turnover of people in their, uh, turnover ownership, but I say, but I, but I think the biggest issue,

1097
01:33:16,768 --> 01:33:20,893
that they have is this, I think it's just an out note, lack of training.

1098
01:33:21,353 --> 01:33:25,057
Again, simple issues that should be resolved, can't be resolved.

1099
01:33:26,098 --> 01:33:31,764
The people that they hire to even go out on the streets don't know what they're doing.

1100
01:33:31,885 --> 01:33:33,927
And I say, I've had several problems with myself.

1101
01:33:35,020 --> 01:33:37,562
I've helped people on the street with problems.

1102
01:33:37,602 --> 01:33:43,405
So, again, I think one of the biggest issues I'll bring up next week is the lack of training of their employees.

1103
01:33:43,465 --> 01:33:47,988
And I urge, you know, to say the meeting is scheduled for 530.

1104
01:33:48,328 --> 01:33:49,709
So we won't be pressed for time.

1105
01:33:50,589 --> 01:33:54,592
And hopefully we'll have a lot of these issues discussed next week.

1106
01:33:55,152 --> 01:33:55,752
Thank you, Mr. President.

1107
01:33:57,853 --> 01:33:58,534
Councilmember Kerr.

1108
01:33:58,814 --> 01:33:59,694
Thank you, President Marks.

1109
01:33:59,735 --> 01:34:01,536
And I agree with President Carviello.

1110
01:34:01,556 --> 01:34:02,636
I 100 percent the last

1111
01:34:04,427 --> 01:34:14,354
The complaints I've received in the last four to six weeks have to do with lack of training of personnel, whether it be the actual people that are giving the tickets or people in Park Medford.

1112
01:34:14,574 --> 01:34:19,418
Lack of training is a huge problem, and it's increased the volume of complaints for sure.

1113
01:34:19,438 --> 01:34:27,984
I would just ask my council president if we could also request a copy of the new contract, if we could take a look at that before next week as well.

1114
01:34:28,024 --> 01:34:31,827
I know there's a list going around through email of things we want.

1115
01:34:32,271 --> 01:34:36,353
Park Medford to provide to us beforehand and that would be pretty important.

1116
01:34:36,833 --> 01:34:38,534
Um, I will make that part of the report next week.

1117
01:34:38,734 --> 01:34:39,094
Thank you.

1118
01:34:39,154 --> 01:34:39,474
Thank you.

1119
01:34:41,195 --> 01:34:43,976
On the motion of council Lungo current, all in favor.

1120
01:34:44,656 --> 01:34:45,997
Roll call has been requested.

1121
01:34:47,938 --> 01:34:49,018
Councilor Knight, would you like to speak?

1122
01:34:49,038 --> 01:34:52,240
Um, I just like the record to reflect that I'm in opposition.

1123
01:34:52,540 --> 01:34:56,241
I find that it would be impossible to administer such a pro policy.

1124
01:34:56,421 --> 01:34:58,582
Number one and number two, we are meeting with Park Medford next week.

1125
01:34:58,622 --> 01:35:00,203
So I'd like the record to reflect that I'm in opposition.

1126
01:35:00,743 --> 01:35:01,584
for those reasons.

1127
01:35:01,824 --> 01:35:02,384
Duly noted.

1128
01:35:03,045 --> 01:35:03,865
Clerk will call the roll.

1129
01:35:06,367 --> 01:35:07,428
Councilor Delval and Ruscio.

1130
01:35:10,290 --> 01:35:10,610
Yes.

1131
01:35:11,591 --> 01:35:12,331
Councilor Falco.

1132
01:35:12,491 --> 01:35:12,731
Yes.

1133
01:35:13,392 --> 01:35:13,912
Councilor Knight.

1134
01:35:13,972 --> 01:35:14,172
No.

1135
01:35:15,053 --> 01:35:15,753
Councilor McCurran.

1136
01:35:15,833 --> 01:35:16,034
Yes.

1137
01:35:17,214 --> 01:35:17,935
Vice President Mox.

1138
01:35:18,375 --> 01:35:18,675
Yes.

1139
01:35:18,695 --> 01:35:21,077
Councilor Scarbelli.

1140
01:35:21,217 --> 01:35:21,577
Yes.

1141
01:35:23,619 --> 01:35:24,299
President Caput.

1142
01:35:24,499 --> 01:35:24,740
Yes.

1143
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:27,321
Six in the affirmative, one in the negative.

1144
01:35:27,542 --> 01:35:29,043
The motion is adopted.

1145
01:35:30,148 --> 01:35:32,570
Is there a motion to revert back to the regular order of a business?

1146
01:35:32,770 --> 01:35:35,212
All in favor?

1147
01:35:35,232 --> 01:35:35,612
Opposed?

1148
01:35:35,652 --> 01:35:36,172
The ayes have it.

1149
01:35:36,192 --> 01:35:37,814
We revert back to the regular order of business.

1150
01:35:39,235 --> 01:35:45,159
Paper 17-052 offered by President Caviello.

1151
01:35:45,859 --> 01:35:56,647
Be resolved that the Memphis City Council have the Mayor demand that the contractor who paved Willis Ave and Governor's Ave grind and repave both streets due to shoddy work.

1152
01:35:57,147 --> 01:35:58,068
Council President?

1153
01:35:59,306 --> 01:36:00,067
Thank you, Mr. President.

1154
01:36:00,147 --> 01:36:05,049
Mr. President, I don't know if many people have had a chance to drive down Willis Avenue.

1155
01:36:05,069 --> 01:36:08,511
I received numerous complaints from the residents there.

1156
01:36:09,732 --> 01:36:18,637
This is a street that was recently paved, and if you go by, you'll see it's coming up on many spots.

1157
01:36:18,697 --> 01:36:19,477
I know we have a

1158
01:36:21,298 --> 01:36:27,441
a resolution from the mayor that they will return in the spring and correct the situation.

1159
01:36:28,321 --> 01:36:30,562
I don't know what they call correct the situation.

1160
01:36:31,502 --> 01:36:35,644
My version of correct the situation is to rip it up and repave it.

1161
01:36:36,584 --> 01:36:37,704
Governor Zab, the same thing.

1162
01:36:38,205 --> 01:36:41,386
You see around the sewer covers and the manholes, it's coming up.

1163
01:36:41,526 --> 01:36:45,627
There's a major divide right in the middle of the road.

1164
01:36:46,208 --> 01:36:49,409
Every time it's paved, especially right now with the plows coming down.

1165
01:36:50,109 --> 01:36:53,732
it's coming up and we haven't even, we haven't even got to the weather and we've had a light winter.

1166
01:36:54,613 --> 01:36:59,917
So, uh, again, um, I know the mayor says, uh, they're going to return to the spring and correct the situation.

1167
01:37:00,578 --> 01:37:07,084
Um, I hope that correcting the situation means repaving, uh, grinding and repaving those two streets, Mr. President.

1168
01:37:08,685 --> 01:37:11,367
On the motion by council president Caviello, all in favor.

1169
01:37:12,228 --> 01:37:12,688
Opposed?

1170
01:37:13,309 --> 01:37:13,969
The ayes have it.

1171
01:37:14,310 --> 01:37:15,711
The motion is adopted.

1172
01:37:16,641 --> 01:37:40,797
Paper 17-053, offered by Vice President Mox, whereas pop-up community spaces create a positive energy by driving investment and community spirit, and whereas the idea that short-term pop-up community spaces can create long-term, wide-reaching transformation in both business districts and neighborhoods, then be it resolved that the

1173
01:37:41,558 --> 01:37:49,862
City of Method implement a pop-up community space plan transforming empty storefronts and vacant lots into usable community space.

1174
01:37:50,702 --> 01:37:52,123
Council Vice President Michael Mox.

1175
01:37:56,885 --> 01:37:57,565
Councilor Mox.

1176
01:38:01,087 --> 01:38:01,967
Thank you, Mr. President.

1177
01:38:07,263 --> 01:38:08,203
Thank you, Mr. President.

1178
01:38:08,304 --> 01:38:16,788
I offered this resolution tonight to address a number of issues that have been in this community for a number of years.

1179
01:38:17,908 --> 01:38:24,092
Ideally, the issue of vacant stores, Mr. President, and vacant lots within this community.

1180
01:38:25,432 --> 01:38:34,996
All you need to do is traverse any of the business districts or go into any of our neighborhoods and you'll see what I'm talking about throughout this community.

1181
01:38:35,836 --> 01:38:39,518
To turn a vacant lot and storefront into a usable community space,

1182
01:38:40,018 --> 01:38:46,562
benefits not only the owner of the property, but also residents of this community.

1183
01:38:47,442 --> 01:38:57,688
And working with property owners to establish a public-private partnership, which would, in my opinion, go a long way to addressing some of the issues

1184
01:38:58,148 --> 01:39:16,143
that we're seeing right now throughout the community and I think it builds a sense of community and pride and it also in an important time as we see right now with people divided I think this is a way of bringing people in the community back together again.

1185
01:39:16,744 --> 01:39:20,147
So the resolution tonight with the purpose of

1186
01:39:22,392 --> 01:39:33,321
offering this olive branch to the administration to ask that they develop a program to deal with pop-up community space.

1187
01:39:34,261 --> 01:39:47,252
And the development of pop-up community space will change and redirect derelict properties with the opportunity to enhance an area and to provide an opportunity to build community.

1188
01:39:48,532 --> 01:39:53,334
What I mean by derelict areas is you may have a vacant lot in the community.

1189
01:39:54,035 --> 01:40:02,899
And this is being done, I might add, not only in this state, but across this country, the concept of pop-up community space.

1190
01:40:03,599 --> 01:40:12,283
And it's an ingenious way of taking a piece of property that's underutilized and creating an area that people want to flock to.

1191
01:40:15,627 --> 01:40:20,172
Some of the ideas is to create a garden space.

1192
01:40:20,612 --> 01:40:28,120
We all know that this community has a waiting list of, I think it's four or five years to be put on the garden list.

1193
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:36,288
And we have the fortunate aspect of having, I believe it's 26 parks in this community, and it would be great to have

1194
01:40:37,329 --> 01:40:47,660
pockets within this community and neighborhoods where these parks exist that we can create a small pop-up community gardens.

1195
01:40:48,381 --> 01:40:53,787
It also, Mr. President, would go a long way to what they refer to as seed balming.

1196
01:40:54,510 --> 01:40:56,312
I'm not asking anyone to do any bombing.

1197
01:40:56,972 --> 01:40:58,033
This is seed bombing.

1198
01:40:58,353 --> 01:41:08,502
And what happens is in a vacant lot, you know, groups get together with all sorts of variety of seeds and they go and they bomb a lot with seeds.

1199
01:41:09,062 --> 01:41:18,330
And it creates an area that you may not want to throw a can or a piece of trash on because there's flowers that are popping up and there's grass popping up.

1200
01:41:18,730 --> 01:41:20,952
And it creates a sense of pride in a community.

1201
01:41:21,399 --> 01:41:26,881
And that's one aspect that other communities throughout this country have done called seed bombing.

1202
01:41:28,262 --> 01:41:46,429
I also spoke a while back about having a particular park or maybe several parks that have a performance stage, a very inexpensive proposal to build a stage, maybe 10 by 10, you know, a foot off the ground that would allow performances in the nice weather.

1203
01:41:46,776 --> 01:41:56,600
So it would allow artists and performing arts and anyone else that would like to display their art on a stage in a particular park.

1204
01:41:57,201 --> 01:42:03,063
And that draws the community back into the park, which I believe are being underutilized right now.

1205
01:42:03,744 --> 01:42:15,589
We spoke over the last several years in the winter about having ice rinks at some of our parks, bringing the fire department in and flooding the park out and creating a makeshift pop-up ice rink.

1206
01:42:16,425 --> 01:42:33,813
You know, what better aspect to have if you live up the heights, or you live in South Meffitt, or in West Meffitt, or at the hillside, to be able to go to your local park 50 yards away, throw on your skates, and skate around with your kids or your friends at very minimal cost.

1207
01:42:34,493 --> 01:42:36,294
And it's a great way to meet your neighbors.

1208
01:42:36,694 --> 01:42:40,276
It's a great way to get back involved in the community, Mr. President.

1209
01:42:42,517 --> 01:42:45,738
We could do a luge down Fulton Street if Councilor De La Rosa would like to do that.

1210
01:42:47,172 --> 01:42:55,977
You know, when we talk about community-public-private partnership, you know, I talked about lots, and some of them are lots that are owned by the city.

1211
01:42:56,557 --> 01:42:59,439
We have a lot out here in back of City Hall where the buses park.

1212
01:43:00,619 --> 01:43:07,383
You know, you come out here during any given time, it's a filthy, dirty lot, riddled with puddles and dirt and debris.

1213
01:43:08,066 --> 01:43:23,455
Wouldn't it be great to put a small little putting range where you can have a green that's, you know, maybe 25 by 25 with a plastic fence around it and have four or five little putting greens where people come down and putt?

1214
01:43:24,035 --> 01:43:31,439
I mean, it's just, again, an inexpensive way to put something together, bring some interest into the community,

1215
01:43:33,223 --> 01:43:37,565
you know, give it a sense of community pride and a sense of ownership.

1216
01:43:38,225 --> 01:43:42,466
And those are the thoughts regarding public space.

1217
01:43:42,906 --> 01:43:53,770
Now, when you deal with private space for an empty storefront, any owner of property knows that foot traffic is vital to a property owner.

1218
01:43:54,311 --> 01:43:58,132
And when you have a vacant property, you don't get as much foot traffic.

1219
01:43:58,612 --> 01:44:00,312
as if there's business in the area.

1220
01:44:00,993 --> 01:44:20,457
And I think it would be prudent for this city to devise a policy where they give a tax incentive to business owners that might have, or landowners that might have, a vacant piece of property that could be used, Mr. President, as a storefront to maybe house someone's art, or maybe have, Mr. President,

1221
01:44:21,077 --> 01:44:27,642
art classes that are given by Cachet in the city at free cost to the residents of this community.

1222
01:44:28,243 --> 01:44:34,448
And I know I've spoken with members of Cachet and they'd be very interested in this concept.

1223
01:44:35,088 --> 01:44:48,439
And I think it would also bring the art community back together with the community and show what can be done with the arts throughout this entire community.

1224
01:44:50,020 --> 01:45:09,904
So I think the issues that face this particular thing from happening, pop-up community gathering spaces, is the fact that the city has to develop a template on the criteria for what type of activities would be acceptable in this community and for what uses.

1225
01:45:10,844 --> 01:45:19,026
Also, Mr. President, there's a liability issue and safety issue, and that's something that needs to be addressed with the city solicitor,

1226
01:45:19,526 --> 01:45:26,808
and the Chief of Police, but it's something that we can overcome and something that's very doable in this community.

1227
01:45:26,828 --> 01:45:31,589
I wanted to just call to everyone's attention an article I read in the Boston Globe.

1228
01:45:32,109 --> 01:45:44,992
It was April of 2016 and the city of Somerville has a very similar pop-up plan and they had a gentleman that, if you would indulge me, I'd just like to read

1229
01:45:45,398 --> 01:45:46,318
a paragraph or two.

1230
01:45:47,079 --> 01:45:58,684
The article goes, where others may have seen nothing but a vacant auto body shop, Chase Wagner saw an opportunity to create a temporary place for people to showcase their artwork

1231
01:45:59,145 --> 01:46:01,446
play sports, and gather for events.

1232
01:46:02,187 --> 01:46:20,799
Wagner, a Pittsburgh native who moved to Boston area nearly four years ago, is in the midst of transforming the former unlimited auto body and corp, a building on Somerville Ave in Somerville, into what he's dubbed the clubhouse, a multi-use space that features an outdoor basketball court,

1233
01:46:23,357 --> 01:46:26,019
Wagner would be occupying the space until the fall of 2017.

1234
01:46:26,279 --> 01:46:41,230
He envisioned scheduling pop-up events like basketball tournaments with food trucks, outdoor spin classes, indoor art gallery, yoga classes, movie nights using a projector and a shop wall with a big screen.

1235
01:46:41,790 --> 01:46:52,658
The garage is slated to come down to make way for condos, and Wagner thinks this is a unique opportunity to take the space for the time being and turn it into a usable community space.

1236
01:46:54,434 --> 01:47:01,122
So he went to the city of Somerville and talked to the property owner and apparently they're moving forward with that

1237
01:47:01,712 --> 01:47:03,353
particular initiative, Mr. President.

1238
01:47:03,673 --> 01:47:11,016
That's one of many, many things that are going on in other communities in this state and across the country.

1239
01:47:11,417 --> 01:47:29,485
And I think it would be a great fit for this community, and I think it would be a doable fit for us, and it would provide for areas that currently right now are vacant and not being totally utilized for a great gathering space.

1240
01:47:30,225 --> 01:47:33,947
and potential usage for residents of this community.

1241
01:47:34,467 --> 01:47:58,480
So I would ask, Mr. President, that this paper be sent to the administration so they can start developing a template and possibly put together a coordinator of this to get the ball rolling and start the initiative, Mr. President, on moving forward on a pop-up community space plan for this entire community.

1242
01:47:59,038 --> 01:47:59,438
Thank you.

1243
01:47:59,518 --> 01:48:00,119
Counselor Knight.

1244
01:48:00,900 --> 01:48:02,141
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1245
01:48:02,181 --> 01:48:03,021
And vice president marks.

1246
01:48:03,041 --> 01:48:04,322
I think this is a great resolution.

1247
01:48:04,923 --> 01:48:18,894
Um, in your speech, you did mention a few items that, uh, my whole heartedly support such as a tax incentivizing, uh, vacant storefronts to begin to, uh, partner with our community to fill that space so that we don't have blighted squares and downtowns.

1248
01:48:19,455 --> 01:48:24,659
Um, you also mentioned about, um, our underutilized parks and opportunities that we have at our parks and, uh,

1249
01:48:25,173 --> 01:48:42,763
After reviewing the minutes of the parks board meeting that I attended last week, you'll note that the minutes reflect that the administration is looking into potentially putting up temporary skating rinks at some of our parks, and they're also seeking grant funding to put in a water and spray park at Harris Park, Mr. President.

1250
01:48:42,783 --> 01:48:44,404
So those are a couple of things that are coming down the line.

1251
01:48:45,044 --> 01:48:46,805
Hopefully, they come to fruition.

1252
01:48:46,845 --> 01:48:48,586
But I think this is a great idea.

1253
01:48:48,626 --> 01:48:54,710
I think that we're all on the same page in this regard, us here on the council and the administration, in terms of what direction we want to see

1254
01:48:55,374 --> 01:48:56,415
happen with our open space.

1255
01:48:56,475 --> 01:48:58,236
We don't want it to be open and underutilized.

1256
01:48:58,276 --> 01:49:00,317
We don't want it to be open and not utilized at all.

1257
01:49:00,577 --> 01:49:04,160
We want it to be open, accessible, and be an asset and a value to the community.

1258
01:49:04,200 --> 01:49:07,001
So I thank Councilor Moxley for bringing this measure up, and I move for approval.

1259
01:49:07,582 --> 01:49:07,962
Thank you.

1260
01:49:08,422 --> 01:49:13,525
On the motion by Councilor Moxley to send this paper to the Mayor for further review.

1261
01:49:14,306 --> 01:49:15,006
All those in favor?

1262
01:49:15,026 --> 01:49:15,747
Aye.

1263
01:49:16,447 --> 01:49:17,748
Roll call vote has been requested.

1264
01:49:17,768 --> 01:49:24,532
Excuse me, Mr. Capstan, did you want to speak?

1265
01:49:24,848 --> 01:49:25,128
May I?

1266
01:49:26,349 --> 01:49:27,310
Name and address of the record, please.

1267
01:49:27,330 --> 01:49:27,910
Very brief.

1268
01:49:28,170 --> 01:49:30,612
Andrew Cushion Street, Method Mass, Castanetti.

1269
01:49:31,452 --> 01:49:34,975
This pop-up idea is a good idea, I believe, by Councilor Marks.

1270
01:49:36,395 --> 01:49:44,080
I believe a friend of mine on Charles Street does it during the November, December holiday seasons on Charles Street in Boston.

1271
01:49:45,101 --> 01:49:48,703
And I think it's a great idea if we have vacancies.

1272
01:49:50,084 --> 01:49:53,086
I'm not sure of any around Method Square itself right now.

1273
01:49:55,388 --> 01:49:57,229
But of course, the landlord's gonna have to okay it.

1274
01:49:57,429 --> 01:50:05,611
And as a councilor has said earlier, if the concern is also about liability, that concern would have to be satisfied somehow, I'm sure.

1275
01:50:06,371 --> 01:50:16,154
And as far as the open fields, I think councilor said something about palm seed or something.

1276
01:50:16,574 --> 01:50:18,215
Seed balms, that's a great idea.

1277
01:50:18,235 --> 01:50:21,156
I think we should plant a lot of seeds and plant a lot of grass.

1278
01:50:22,645 --> 01:50:30,851
And then after we're all done, maybe we could take care of our streets, too, and fix some of the holes, the potholes, as Councilor LaRusso says.

1279
01:50:31,492 --> 01:50:32,112
Thank you for this.

1280
01:50:32,172 --> 01:50:33,033
Here's some tar bombs.

1281
01:50:35,275 --> 01:50:37,937
On the motion by Councilor, name and address, I reckon.

1282
01:50:38,510 --> 01:50:40,712
just real briefly show Rodriguez 21 Park Street.

1283
01:50:41,352 --> 01:50:52,460
Um, it's, it sounds like an interesting idea and I hope that it will go hand in hand with possible blight tax for the many businesses buildings that are remaining vacant for years on end for tax purposes.

1284
01:50:53,541 --> 01:50:54,642
That's how we should fund this.

1285
01:50:54,702 --> 01:51:05,610
And hopefully the project will go bankrupt quickly as these businesses learn that it's not beneficial to remain empty and the square and the surrounding areas can become vibrant and wonderful and Medford can blossom.

1286
01:51:06,405 --> 01:51:06,765
Thank you.

1287
01:51:06,986 --> 01:51:07,326
Thank you.

1288
01:51:07,406 --> 01:51:11,569
On the motion by Councilor Mark, seconded by Councilor Knight, roll call has been requested.

1289
01:51:12,350 --> 01:51:13,451
Councilor Dela Rousseau.

1290
01:51:13,771 --> 01:51:13,991
Yes.

1291
01:51:14,572 --> 01:51:15,332
Councilor Falco.

1292
01:51:15,472 --> 01:51:15,632
Yes.

1293
01:51:16,213 --> 01:51:16,753
Councilor Knight.

1294
01:51:16,914 --> 01:51:17,274
Yes.

1295
01:51:17,714 --> 01:51:18,575
Councilor O'Connor.

1296
01:51:18,675 --> 01:51:18,855
Yes.

1297
01:51:19,496 --> 01:51:20,356
Vice-President Marks.

1298
01:51:20,536 --> 01:51:20,817
Yes.

1299
01:51:21,217 --> 01:51:22,038
Councilor Scott Kelly.

1300
01:51:22,158 --> 01:51:22,358
Yes.

1301
01:51:22,918 --> 01:51:23,959
Vice-President Caviello.

1302
01:51:24,219 --> 01:51:24,520
Yes.

1303
01:51:27,902 --> 01:51:32,006
On the motion, seven in the affirmative, none in the negative, the motion is adopted.

1304
01:51:32,606 --> 01:51:32,846
Paper 17.

1305
01:51:33,971 --> 01:51:47,563
O dash O five four offered by council Longo Kern be resolved at the Memphis city council be provided with the historic district commission's opinion regarding the potential development on Salem street parcel council one go current.

1306
01:51:48,984 --> 01:51:49,304
Thank you.

1307
01:51:49,324 --> 01:52:01,415
Um, vice president Mark's just looking for approval of the paper to get a copy of, um, the historic district commission's opinions and concerns regarding the potential development of the Salem street parcel.

1308
01:52:01,923 --> 01:52:11,707
And just to amend it to also get the comments, concerns, and recommendations from the engineer's office with regards to the same parcel, and I move approval, the roll call vote.

1309
01:52:12,868 --> 01:52:15,409
On the motion of approval, all in favor?

1310
01:52:15,689 --> 01:52:15,849
Aye.

1311
01:52:16,269 --> 01:52:16,829
Opposed?

1312
01:52:16,909 --> 01:52:18,550
I'm sorry, roll call vote has been requested.

1313
01:52:18,970 --> 01:52:20,071
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1314
01:52:23,932 --> 01:52:24,773
Councilor Dela Rousseau?

1315
01:52:25,373 --> 01:52:25,573
No.

1316
01:52:26,733 --> 01:52:27,434
Councilor Scalzo?

1317
01:52:27,794 --> 01:52:27,974
Yes.

1318
01:52:28,734 --> 01:52:29,215
Councilor Neill?

1319
01:52:29,915 --> 01:52:30,095
Yes.

1320
01:52:31,830 --> 01:52:32,110
Yes.

1321
01:52:33,751 --> 01:52:34,091
Yes.

1322
01:52:35,311 --> 01:52:35,571
Yes.

1323
01:52:41,052 --> 01:52:41,913
Six in the affirmative.

1324
01:52:41,973 --> 01:52:43,053
One of the negative.

1325
01:52:43,073 --> 01:52:44,653
The motion is adopted.

1326
01:52:44,673 --> 01:52:53,955
Uh, is there a motion motion to spend the rules committee of the whole report relative to the, uh,

1327
01:52:57,715 --> 01:53:01,357
appointment of the city council representative to the Cormel stadium commission.

1328
01:53:04,179 --> 01:53:05,259
Do we have that committee report?

1329
01:53:05,279 --> 01:53:05,700
Mr. Clerk.

1330
01:53:16,443 --> 01:53:17,324
Councilor Del Rosso.

1331
01:53:17,664 --> 01:53:21,087
The Committee of the Whole met this evening at six o'clock.

1332
01:53:21,968 --> 01:53:26,111
They entertained a previously submitted candidate.

1333
01:53:26,852 --> 01:53:39,042
In the intervening time where that candidate was made known to this body, no other applicants presented themselves to the clerk or to the mayor's office, nor were we forwarded any additional information.

1334
01:53:39,642 --> 01:53:42,605
After a careful examination of the background of the candidate,

1335
01:53:43,466 --> 01:53:53,291
uh, an opportunity for each of the counselors to ask questions and engage in attorney Gliona's background and acknowledge his commitment to athletics.

1336
01:53:53,692 --> 01:54:12,582
The committee, the whole, uh, voted unanimously, uh, six in the affirmative, one absent, uh, to, uh, submit to the council approval, uh, for the appointment of Mr. Gliona, attorney Gliona as the council's representative to the, um,

1337
01:54:13,872 --> 01:54:14,632
Hormel Commission.

1338
01:54:16,833 --> 01:54:18,254
Do we have an appointment term?

1339
01:54:19,194 --> 01:54:26,317
A term to complete Cosimo Volpi's, Mr. Volpi's term, which will end in 2018 or 19?

1340
01:54:26,357 --> 01:54:26,317
19.

1341
01:54:26,397 --> 01:54:26,877
February 16th.

1342
01:54:26,897 --> 01:54:26,957
16th, 2019.

1343
01:54:36,718 --> 01:54:37,859
Move approval, Mr. President.

1344
01:54:37,939 --> 01:54:48,664
So the motion of approval by Councilor DelaRusso that Attorney Lenny Galeano be appointed to the Hormel Commission to complete the term to February 16th, 2019.

1345
01:54:48,784 --> 01:54:50,785
Second, Mr. President.

1346
01:54:52,326 --> 01:54:55,107
The committee reports adopted.

1347
01:54:55,568 --> 01:54:59,029
And I would ask that, I believe we have to take a vote in this council.

1348
01:54:59,570 --> 01:55:01,991
So I would ask that it be done by a roll call vote.

1349
01:55:07,715 --> 01:55:09,736
Point of clarification, Mr. President?

1350
01:55:12,097 --> 01:55:14,498
We're taking a roll call vote to adopt the committee report.

1351
01:55:14,518 --> 01:55:15,078
Is that correct?

1352
01:55:16,819 --> 01:55:17,079
Yes.

1353
01:55:17,099 --> 01:55:18,300
And then we need to take a vote on the appointment.

1354
01:55:18,320 --> 01:55:21,541
Then we need to vote on the appointment.

1355
01:55:21,561 --> 01:55:22,362
Let's do this first.

1356
01:55:22,382 --> 01:55:23,582
Let's adopt the committee report.

1357
01:55:27,624 --> 01:55:29,345
We can do it with a simple yay or nay.

1358
01:55:31,886 --> 01:55:35,008
I believe roll calls have been rather superfluous.

1359
01:55:42,088 --> 01:55:43,089
That's why I vote no.

1360
01:55:45,990 --> 01:55:53,594
Okay, so a motion to take paper 16-795 off the table, the appointment of Leonard A. Gleona at Hormel Stadium.

1361
01:55:54,914 --> 01:56:00,297
The committee report was adopted tonight, and there was a motion by Councilor De La Rosa to move approval.

1362
01:56:00,737 --> 01:56:01,317
All in favor?

1363
01:56:01,597 --> 01:56:01,697
Aye.

1364
01:56:02,078 --> 01:56:02,518
Opposed?

1365
01:56:03,570 --> 01:56:04,190
The ayes have it.

1366
01:56:04,951 --> 01:56:06,471
The committee report was adopted.

1367
01:56:07,011 --> 01:56:13,654
Now to take the appointment of Lenny Gliona to the Haumel Commission, I believe requires a vote of this council.

1368
01:56:13,874 --> 01:56:17,875
Motion to take paper 16795 off the table for a vote, Mr. President.

1369
01:56:18,415 --> 01:56:24,078
So the motion by council tonight to take paper 16-795 for a vote of this council.

1370
01:56:24,978 --> 01:56:30,460
So I would ask that it be done by a roll call vote, Mr. President, with the name of the person that was nominated.

1371
01:56:32,323 --> 01:56:34,564
The name of Lenny Gleona was, was offered.

1372
01:56:35,164 --> 01:56:35,364
Yes.

1373
01:56:35,444 --> 01:56:35,564
Yes.

1374
01:56:35,584 --> 01:56:35,825
Yes.

1375
01:56:35,845 --> 01:56:35,985
Yes.

1376
01:56:36,005 --> 01:56:36,225
Yes.

1377
01:56:36,525 --> 01:56:36,925
Yes.

1378
01:56:36,945 --> 01:56:43,088
Someone in the affirmative.

1379
01:56:43,168 --> 01:56:46,869
Uh, Mr. Lenny Gleona has been appointed as the council's,

1380
01:57:00,988 --> 01:57:03,229
representative to the Hormel commission.

1381
01:57:03,769 --> 01:57:04,489
Congratulations.

1382
01:57:04,569 --> 01:57:07,850
Mr. President motion to take papers in the hands of the clerk.

1383
01:57:09,450 --> 01:57:11,811
Motion by council light to take papers in the hands of the clerk.

1384
01:57:11,911 --> 01:57:12,451
Mr. Clerk.

1385
01:57:21,013 --> 01:57:27,455
Often by president caveat will be resolved that the method city council commend and congratulate Reverend Noah Evans,

1386
01:57:28,048 --> 01:57:31,490
on his recent promotion by the Episcopal Church.

1387
01:57:32,110 --> 01:57:33,932
Council President Caviello.

1388
01:57:34,192 --> 01:57:35,292
Thank you, thank you, Mr. President.

1389
01:57:35,813 --> 01:57:48,580
I was informed this week that Noah Evans has been elevated in the Episcopal Church to a higher status, and I wanted to commend and congratulate him.

1390
01:57:50,401 --> 01:57:55,765
The Reverend has been instrumental in this community in many ways, and I would hope that

1391
01:57:57,274 --> 01:58:01,918
We could bring him up here for a thank you for all the work that he's done within this community.

1392
01:58:01,978 --> 01:58:05,360
And I think his last sermon will be on March 5th.

1393
01:58:06,101 --> 01:58:09,884
And if everybody could go, that would be a great testament to him.

1394
01:58:10,324 --> 01:58:19,291
I say the reverend has done great work in this community, and I hope whoever replaces him is half as good as him, we'd have a winner.

1395
01:58:19,452 --> 01:58:26,237
So again, I'd ask that we bring him up here for some type of thank you or commendation before he leaves Medford.

1396
01:58:26,950 --> 01:58:28,771
Thank you, Mr. President.

1397
01:58:28,831 --> 01:58:29,571
Counselor Falco.

1398
01:58:30,551 --> 01:58:31,332
Thank you, Mr. President.

1399
01:58:31,532 --> 01:58:36,594
I also would like to congratulate Reverend Noah on his new assignment at Pittsburgh.

1400
01:58:37,754 --> 01:58:42,096
I talked to him on Sunday, and he's very excited about the new opportunity.

1401
01:58:42,856 --> 01:58:45,758
But I'd just like to say thank you to him and his family.

1402
01:58:45,838 --> 01:58:49,839
They have done a tremendous amount of great work in our community.

1403
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:54,721
The great Episcopal Church and Noah have been a great community partner.

1404
01:58:56,923 --> 01:59:01,004
a great job growing the interfaith community group.

1405
01:59:01,385 --> 01:59:06,666
And he's just been a significant contributor to everything that occurs in our city.

1406
01:59:07,107 --> 01:59:08,907
And I'd just like to say thank you for his time and effort.

1407
01:59:09,487 --> 01:59:10,148
Thank you, Counsel.

1408
01:59:10,728 --> 01:59:11,508
Counsel Del Russo.

1409
01:59:12,068 --> 01:59:18,430
I've also would like to extend my congratulations and best wishes to Noah Evans and family.

1410
01:59:19,551 --> 01:59:22,912
Father and I have collaborated in work

1411
01:59:25,982 --> 01:59:35,146
regarding my own personal profession, as well as through mutual friends have collaborated in matters of social justice.

1412
01:59:35,727 --> 01:59:37,728
It's been always a pleasure working with him.

1413
01:59:38,608 --> 01:59:46,432
He's brought growth to the community and to his parish, and we're very grateful to him and wish him well.

1414
01:59:46,452 --> 01:59:48,173
Thank you, Counselor.

1415
01:59:48,193 --> 01:59:49,053
Counselor Scott Pelli.

1416
01:59:49,933 --> 01:59:50,914
I, too.

1417
01:59:51,674 --> 01:59:52,555
I appreciate

1418
01:59:54,562 --> 02:00:08,191
not only for Reverend Noah's ability to reach his congregation, but reach outside and get to the people that don't particularly belong to his church.

1419
02:00:08,511 --> 02:00:20,078
And one thing I can hold true is understanding that his message of peace and community is so evident.

1420
02:00:20,118 --> 02:00:21,139
So we're going to miss him.

1421
02:00:21,159 --> 02:00:23,400
And again, we just want to thank him and wish him luck.

1422
02:00:25,203 --> 02:00:25,463
Thank you.

1423
02:00:25,483 --> 02:00:25,864
Counselor.

1424
02:00:26,304 --> 02:00:26,825
Counselor Knight.

1425
02:00:27,366 --> 02:00:33,533
Mr. President, I've had the distinct honor and pleasure of living next door to the grace Episcopal church for a number of years now.

1426
02:00:33,994 --> 02:00:40,322
And I'm very happy to call father Owens, my neighbor, I'm sorry, father Evans, my neighbor, and I'm going to certainly miss him.

1427
02:00:40,542 --> 02:00:43,025
Um, he's done a great job with the facility, with the property.

1428
02:00:43,498 --> 02:00:52,224
with the landscaping upkeep and with the flowers, Mr. President, so much so that I've seen individuals pull over in their car and actually pull the flowers out of the ground and put them in their own.

1429
02:00:52,945 --> 02:00:57,548
So with that being said, he will be sadly missed, and I do wish him a happy and prosperous career.

1430
02:00:58,629 --> 02:00:59,329
Thank you, Counselor.

1431
02:00:59,349 --> 02:01:00,090
Counselor Lungo-Kern.

1432
02:01:00,270 --> 02:01:03,772
I would also just like to congratulate him and wish him good luck.

1433
02:01:03,832 --> 02:01:05,413
He will be sorely missed.

1434
02:01:06,334 --> 02:01:10,757
The outreach is probably one of the best with regards to that charge, and that's due to him.

1435
02:01:11,217 --> 02:01:12,098
My children

1436
02:01:13,533 --> 02:01:14,353
go to school there.

1437
02:01:14,433 --> 02:01:19,594
So it's just an amazing community that's, that's there and that's due to him.

1438
02:01:19,634 --> 02:01:21,094
And I wish him good luck.

1439
02:01:22,655 --> 02:01:22,975
Thank you.

1440
02:01:22,995 --> 02:01:34,097
And just from the chair, if I could, uh, Reverend Noah has been an outspoken member of this community for a number of years and has been an active, uh, participating resident as well as reverent.

1441
02:01:34,717 --> 02:01:41,258
And I wish him well in his future endeavors on the motion, uh, often by council president, uh, Caviello that,

1442
02:01:41,732 --> 02:01:47,298
an accommodation be sent to Reverend Noah and request his appearance at the council meeting.

1443
02:01:47,919 --> 02:01:48,559
All in favor?

1444
02:01:48,880 --> 02:01:49,020
Aye.

1445
02:01:49,560 --> 02:01:50,001
Opposed?

1446
02:01:50,241 --> 02:01:50,882
The ayes have it.

1447
02:01:50,942 --> 02:01:52,123
The motion is adopted.

1448
02:01:54,045 --> 02:01:57,989
Paper 17-056 offered by President Caviello.

1449
02:01:58,690 --> 02:02:01,513
Be resolved that the Memphis City Council have the code enforcement

1450
02:02:01,948 --> 02:02:08,610
develop some rules for Airbnb in light of the recent fire at the Airbnb in Somerville.

1451
02:02:09,190 --> 02:02:10,711
Council President Caviello.

1452
02:02:11,171 --> 02:02:11,971
Thank you, Mr. President.

1453
02:02:12,352 --> 02:02:21,094
Mr. President, last week there was a very serious fire in Somerville, and I say fortunately nobody died in that.

1454
02:02:21,415 --> 02:02:31,478
But again, this house was an Airbnb, and this is like the Uber of hotels now.

1455
02:02:31,952 --> 02:02:36,514
I mean everybody that has a house now is gonna make it a hotel.

1456
02:02:37,634 --> 02:02:58,522
I think it's time that we develop some type of rules, whether it be the code enforcement or our own council to start policing or regulating these homes to make sure that they have, that the fire department knows that these are being rented out so if they go to your house and they're not just expecting the Caraviello family in there,

1457
02:02:58,982 --> 02:03:03,244
and all four or five people are out, but there may be other people in there that they don't know about.

1458
02:03:03,264 --> 02:03:18,211
To make sure that these houses have proper sprinklers and fire extinguishers, and as well as let the police department know that people in the neighborhood, there's gonna be strangers in the neighborhood to be aware.

1459
02:03:18,491 --> 02:03:27,074
So again, it's better that we be a little proactive on this than wait till there's an accident, something happens,

1460
02:03:29,060 --> 02:03:44,803
So, Mr. President, I ask that we, whether in our group or the code enforcement officer, develop some type of rules to regulate these Airbnbs before there's an accident and somebody gets hurt.

1461
02:03:45,383 --> 02:03:46,263
Thank you, Mr. President.

1462
02:03:46,824 --> 02:03:47,664
Counselor Scott Pelley.

1463
02:03:48,244 --> 02:03:51,164
I thank Council President Cabell for bringing that up.

1464
02:03:51,224 --> 02:03:53,945
And I think that what's key to this is that

1465
02:03:54,632 --> 02:04:06,024
they were registered in that city and, uh, the credit goes to the fire inspector and, um, the people that walked out of that, that building safe.

1466
02:04:06,445 --> 02:04:14,253
It was because of the notification with the fire department and the notification for the residents of that evening that they had a clear

1467
02:04:14,871 --> 02:04:20,333
understanding of where fire extinguishers, our exits were, and, um, and so on.

1468
02:04:20,413 --> 02:04:23,454
So I think that's very important that we follow suit.

1469
02:04:23,634 --> 02:04:33,078
And, um, we as a council also look into our ordinances, uh, with, uh, these Airbnbs that are now popping up everywhere.

1470
02:04:33,138 --> 02:04:33,738
So thank you.

1471
02:04:34,558 --> 02:04:34,838
Thank you.

1472
02:04:34,878 --> 02:04:35,238
Counselor.

1473
02:04:35,278 --> 02:04:35,798
Counselor Knight.

1474
02:04:36,259 --> 02:04:37,779
Um, Mr. President, thank you very much.

1475
02:04:37,819 --> 02:04:38,199
And thank you.

1476
02:04:38,239 --> 02:04:40,000
Counselor Caviello for bringing up this topic.

1477
02:04:40,538 --> 02:04:48,542
Um, as we're all aware, this has been a topic of discussion before the council on a number of different occasions in the subcommittee on zoning and ordinances, um, has been reviewing it.

1478
02:04:49,062 --> 02:05:02,669
Um, presently there has been some discussions about, uh, putting together a short term rental ordinance, uh, that would require certain notifications to be made to the city and to the neighbors in the area as well as a certain permitting processes, Mr. President.

1479
02:05:02,689 --> 02:05:02,809
So.

1480
02:05:03,135 --> 02:05:07,819
I'd anticipate that the subcommittees work on that topic should be complete within the next 30 days or so.

1481
02:05:07,899 --> 02:05:15,385
And I look forward to reporting out a paper with my colleagues for full council deliberation on the motion of council president Caviello.

1482
02:05:15,465 --> 02:05:16,045
All in favor.

1483
02:05:16,346 --> 02:05:16,426
Aye.

1484
02:05:16,806 --> 02:05:17,226
Opposed?

1485
02:05:17,967 --> 02:05:18,587
The ayes have it.

1486
02:05:18,848 --> 02:05:20,049
The motion is adopted.

1487
02:05:22,431 --> 02:05:31,498
Paper offered by council a night and Scott Pelly be resolved that the Meffitt city council extended sincere condolence to the family of Chrissy fields,

1488
02:05:33,057 --> 02:05:36,418
Cedroni, on her recent passing?

1489
02:05:37,759 --> 02:05:38,359
That is correct.

1490
02:05:38,659 --> 02:05:39,259
Counselor Knight.

1491
02:05:40,159 --> 02:05:41,560
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1492
02:05:41,580 --> 02:05:49,062
Chrissy Fields Cedroni passed away recently from a very public battle with cancer, a 2001 graduate of public high school.

1493
02:05:50,283 --> 02:05:50,943
She was a fighter.

1494
02:05:51,023 --> 02:05:51,523
She was tough.

1495
02:05:52,163 --> 02:05:53,343
She was an inspiration to many.

1496
02:05:53,424 --> 02:05:54,344
She's going to be missed.

1497
02:05:54,544 --> 02:05:57,665
And she was well-loved, well-liked, and well-respected in the community.

1498
02:05:57,885 --> 02:06:01,046
And I offer my deepest condolences and ask that my colleagues join me in doing so.

1499
02:06:02,158 --> 02:06:02,979
Counsel Scott Pelley.

1500
02:06:03,539 --> 02:06:05,941
Again, I echo my condolences.

1501
02:06:06,041 --> 02:06:16,488
I know her family will miss her forever, but I know she fought this fight and a public fight that most of us know about and may she rest in peace.

1502
02:06:16,528 --> 02:06:17,129
So thank you.

1503
02:06:17,409 --> 02:06:18,610
All rise for a moment of silence.

1504
02:06:32,477 --> 02:06:41,322
Offered by Counselor Knight and Scott Pelley, be it resolved that the MCC extend its deep and sincere condolence to the family of Kenneth Bascom on the recent passing.

1505
02:06:42,243 --> 02:06:42,803
Counselor Knight.

1506
02:06:43,343 --> 02:06:49,767
Yes, Mr. President, Kenneth Bascom was a 1995 graduate of Medford High School and someone who I was proud to call a friend and a teammate.

1507
02:06:50,027 --> 02:06:51,208
We played basketball together.

1508
02:06:51,268 --> 02:06:59,673
He was the point guard on the 1994-95 Medford High School team that went to the Division I North Finals, losing to the ultimate state champion South Boston.

1509
02:07:01,003 --> 02:07:07,728
I don't want to relive the glory days of sitting on the bench and clapping, Mr. President, while I sat there and watched Kenny put up some good points and have some great games.

1510
02:07:08,469 --> 02:07:09,489
Kenny was a public servant.

1511
02:07:09,509 --> 02:07:12,212
He was a corrections officer at the Framingham State Penitentiary.

1512
02:07:12,732 --> 02:07:18,797
And after another long and public battle with cancer, Mr. Bascom succumbed to his illness, Mr. President.

1513
02:07:18,837 --> 02:07:22,219
So I'd like to offer my condolences to the Bascom family.

1514
02:07:22,299 --> 02:07:25,762
He was someone that was certainly a leader in our community and someone that will be greatly missed.

1515
02:07:26,991 --> 02:07:27,311
Thank you.

1516
02:07:27,351 --> 02:07:28,892
Counsel Scott Pelley.

1517
02:07:29,252 --> 02:07:40,796
I remember Kenny as a young man at Morrison Park that he was truly a fighter then and a little undersized, but the heart of a lion.

1518
02:07:41,537 --> 02:07:50,260
And when when faced with this battle of cancer, Kenny fought it with that same strength and he will be missed.

1519
02:07:50,480 --> 02:07:54,842
I know his teammates and classmates and the Morrison Park family that

1520
02:07:55,479 --> 02:07:57,700
he played for, mourn his loss.

1521
02:07:57,780 --> 02:07:59,260
And he's a great young man.

1522
02:07:59,320 --> 02:08:04,482
And I wish his family much prayers and condolences.

1523
02:08:04,522 --> 02:08:05,582
So thank you.

1524
02:08:07,323 --> 02:08:08,503
All rise for a moment of silence.

1525
02:08:22,288 --> 02:08:22,608
Records.

1526
02:08:24,177 --> 02:08:25,437
The records of the meeting are January 24, 2017.

1527
02:08:25,497 --> 02:08:27,138
Yes, Councilor Felco.

1528
02:08:28,418 --> 02:08:36,419
I just wanted to congratulate the Medford Human Rights Commission.

1529
02:08:36,639 --> 02:08:41,080
This weekend I had the opportunity to attend the Medford Conversations kickoff at Medford High School.

1530
02:08:41,660 --> 02:08:44,280
They had over 100 people that attended.

1531
02:08:44,961 --> 02:08:49,821
And it was just to talk about diversity, race, different cultures within our community.

1532
02:08:50,341 --> 02:08:52,862
It was a very successful event, a lot of participation.

1533
02:08:53,728 --> 02:09:01,409
I know a lot of hard work went into it, so I just wanted to congratulate them for their hard work and thank them for their hard work and congratulate them on a successful event.

1534
02:09:02,070 --> 02:09:02,850
Thank you for the update.

1535
02:09:02,890 --> 02:09:03,290
Thank you.

1536
02:09:04,430 --> 02:09:09,351
The records of the meeting of January 24th, 2017 were passed to council Longo Kern.

1537
02:09:09,371 --> 02:09:10,211
How do you find the records?

1538
02:09:12,791 --> 02:09:14,132
And move approval.

1539
02:09:14,172 --> 02:09:15,192
Go Patriots.

1540
02:09:17,572 --> 02:09:18,433
Second go Patriots.

1541
02:09:18,513 --> 02:09:19,273
Mr. President.

1542
02:09:19,433 --> 02:09:19,893
Thank you.

1543
02:09:19,913 --> 02:09:21,033
Uh, council Longo Kern.

1544
02:09:21,927 --> 02:09:22,648
Councilor Falco.

1545
02:09:23,168 --> 02:09:29,633
If I may really quick, uh, you also wanted to mention, uh, tomorrow night is the community police meeting.

1546
02:09:30,374 --> 02:09:34,057
Uh, this, uh, tomorrow night we will be heading to, uh, the hillside neighborhood.

1547
02:09:34,077 --> 02:09:40,022
We will be at a breed hall, which is the old sacred heart church, um, at the corner of Boston Ave and Winthrop street.

1548
02:09:40,582 --> 02:09:42,384
Uh, so we will be there tomorrow at 7pm.

1549
02:09:43,004 --> 02:09:45,326
Everyone is welcome no matter what neighborhood you're from.

1550
02:09:45,366 --> 02:09:46,467
It's a community police meeting.

1551
02:09:46,882 --> 02:09:53,267
with Chief Sacco and members of the Memphis Police Department to talk about any type of law enforcement or safety issues that you want to talk about.

1552
02:09:53,387 --> 02:09:54,108
Everyone is welcome.

1553
02:09:54,508 --> 02:09:54,809

1554
02:09:54,969 --> 02:09:55,229
Thank you.

1555
02:09:55,309 --> 02:10:00,613
There was also a reverse 911 call that went out alerting the residents of this meeting, so thank you.

1556
02:10:00,734 --> 02:10:01,054
Thank you.

1557
02:10:01,554 --> 02:10:02,595
We have a gentleman at the podium.

1558
02:10:03,776 --> 02:10:04,677
Name and address of the record.

1559
02:10:04,958 --> 02:10:07,759
Thank you, Council Vice President Marks.

1560
02:10:08,139 --> 02:10:13,201
Um, before you adjourn this honorable body, I, Councilor Brianna must've read my mind.

1561
02:10:13,221 --> 02:10:24,286
Um, I, I've often heard the separation of church and state, whatever that means and how it applies and not apply to this, uh, public type of meeting.

1562
02:10:25,266 --> 02:10:34,050
However, um, for the sake of, uh, pulling New England closer together, economically more viable and,

1563
02:10:35,333 --> 02:10:40,014
to put more smiles on the people's faces and have the psychiatrists sell less Prozac.

1564
02:10:42,895 --> 02:10:44,095
I wish the Patriots well.

1565
02:10:45,775 --> 02:10:46,235
Let's pray.

1566
02:10:46,555 --> 02:10:46,915
Thank you.

1567
02:10:47,255 --> 02:10:47,895
As we all do.

1568
02:10:48,456 --> 02:10:54,497
On the motion of President Caviello for adjournment.

1569
02:10:55,237 --> 02:10:56,057

1570
02:10:57,037 --> 02:10:57,477
Opposed?

1571
