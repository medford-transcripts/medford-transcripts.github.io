    <p>[Denis MacDougall]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=1.548">Notice</a>  of intent, 171 Arlington Street, continued from September 17th, 2025. <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=6.773">Alexander</a>  Wong-Berman, a bridge of the shortened notice of intent, to construct an addition to the rear of the house and add a deck at 171 Arlington Street within the 200-foot road front area, borderline subject to flooding and 100-foot buffer zone to the top of Bank of Medford Mass. <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=25.951">And...</a> </p>

    <p>[Heidi Davis]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=28.292">So</a>  we received some additional information, including the construction and post-construction operation and maintenance manual, as well as a revised plan showing the correct location of the trees. <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=49.958">Does</a>  anybody on the commission have any comments or questions regarding the revised material or any other aspect of the filing? <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=60.502">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=63.004">I</a>  don't either. <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=63.585">And</a>  I also reviewed the plant list that he provided and didn't have any, you know, take any exception to that either. <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=69.87">Thanks</a>  for reminding me that there was a revised plant list.</p>

    <p>[EO-vAhUJAKo_SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=79.979">I</a>  don't either.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001777_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=82.201">Nothing</a>  from me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=83.002">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Denis MacDougall]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=84.163">And</a>  the email I got from Craig, he said as well, he has no comments. <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=87.551">based</a>  on what was submitted.</p>

    <p>[Heidi Davis]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=92.272">Prove</a>  this project with conditions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=94.112">Would</a>  they be similar to 173 Arlington, or would there be any changes? <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=104.555">Do</a>  they both have subsurface infiltration? <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=108.415">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=109.776">I</a>  can't remember.</p>

    <p>[Denis MacDougall]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=110.756">I</a>  don't have the other plans. <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=111.736">I</a>  only have these plans in front of me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=114.037">They're</a>  remarkably similar. <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=118.098">I</a>  think the only really additional condition we added was to any vegetation other than the lawn should be native. <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=126.322">That</a>  was the only additional one that we added for 173. <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=128.724">So</a>  we could add that as well, which, I mean, given the list to be provided, I think that's... I'm sorry.</p>

    <p>[Heidi Davis]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=139.009">That</a>  was a question for discussion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=141.29">Oh,</a>  sorry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=144.852">Well,</a>  maybe there is no discussion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=147.436">But</a>  Dennis, I'm asking, is there also subsurface infiltration for 173 Arlington?</p>

    <p>[Denis MacDougall]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=153.443">Yes,</a>  correct. <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=154.445">There</a>  is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=154.825">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=155.286">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=155.706">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=159.25">It's</a>  entirely possible I nodded without thinking I said yes without actually saying yes.</p>

    <p>[EO-vAhUJAKo_SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=166.293">And</a>  is the playlist on the plan or is that a separate document that came in an email in the email that I forwarded to you all?</p>

    <p>[Denis MacDougall]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=173.695">It</a>  had a list of the body of the body of the email. <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=178.196">I'll</a>  read them off the record though. <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=179.296">Maybe</a>  just to have them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=180.597">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=180.877">Wild</a>  bergamot button, bush, winter, holly berry, milkweed, cardinal flower, sweet pepper, bush, honeysuckle and dogwoods.</p>

    <p>[EO-vAhUJAKo_SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=187.118">Sounds</a>  good.</p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=194.514">And</a>  Dennis, did we, with certainty, apply the condition about native plants being a requirement on the other project? <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=203.196">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Heather]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=207.197">Well,</a>  I think we've been pretty consistent on both.</p>

    <p>[Denis MacDougall]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=210.898">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=211.738">So</a>  I think, I mean, they are such remarkably similar projects that really the only difference was that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=226.023">list</a>  that I can basically say, you know, the following plants from the, from, you know, Shelby from this list and just list them all.</p>

    <p>[Heidi Davis]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=236.15">Sure,</a>  or you can just include the plant list in the citations. <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=241.114">Okay,</a>  oh yeah, that's true.</p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=243.656">I'll</a>  say just for maybe another perspective, <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=247.489">I'm</a>  glad that we got the additional information from this applicant to confirm what we needed to confirm. <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=252.915">I</a>  will say, I think they demonstrated that they've taken some steps to protect the existing trees and things like that, unprompted by us, which is good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=264.323">I'd</a>  be comfortable with giving them some latitude on the plant list and just including the condition that it be a native, you know, that they select native plants or that they even prioritize native plants. <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=278.112">I</a>  do think we should be consistent. <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=280.453">I</a>  think if we were strict about native plants only, we wouldn't have any lilacs or hydrangeas or a lot of other things in our gardens. <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=290.521">And</a>  so when it's in somebody's yard, I feel like giving them a little bit more latitude is reasonable. <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=295.805">But</a>  in this case, let's keep the native plant. <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=298.888">I</a>  would advocate for keeping the native plant requirement, but not limiting them to the list that they provided only.</p>

    <p>[Heather]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=307.581">This</a>  fellow definitely did his homework and attempted to come as prepared as possible.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001777_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=317.863">Perhaps</a>  then, Jeremy, we reference vascular plants in Massachusetts or the USDA plant list, something specific for them to reference? <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=331.786">Or</a>  is that too pedantic?</p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=334.027">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=337.89">I</a>  am not sure what the most comprehensive native plants catalog for the state would be. <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=344.873">But</a>  I'm on board with referencing something to guide that.</p>

    <p>[Heidi Davis]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=352.195">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=352.455">So</a>  I've heard two different things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=354.276">One</a>  is that we should provide some latitude because it's a yard, and the other one is limiting it to native plants only. <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=360.358">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=363.599">Sorry,</a>  Heidi. <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=364.459">I</a>  jumped around a little bit in my thought. <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=367.223">I</a>  think for the sake of consistency in this application, because it is next door and it's a very similar project, we should maintain the same requirement for the two projects. <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=378.932">What</a>  I should have said is when we evaluate these in the future, let's think about the implications of applying a native only requirement. <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=390.643">In</a>  certain situations, I think that there can be some more latitude beyond that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=394.464">But</a>  in this case, I think consistency is good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=400.645">Great.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=400.925">Thank</a>  you for clarifying that.</p>

    <p>[EO-vAhUJAKo_SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=402.525">And</a>  Dennis, have you written the order of conditions for 173 yet?</p>

    <p>[Denis MacDougall]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=408.486">I</a>  did, and then I was out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=412.027">So</a>  I'm glad you kind of reminded me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=414.808">I'll</a>  send it out to you tomorrow.</p>

    <p>[EO-vAhUJAKo_SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=418.879">Can</a>  you read us the language is it simply it's very yeah.</p>

    <p>[Denis MacDougall]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=426.686">I</a>  just sort of took it from the meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=428.128">It's.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=428.368">Yeah,</a>  just any vegetation other than the 1 shall be native. <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=443.157">vegetation,</a>  that sort of thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=445.318">Basically,</a>  that sort of... Native species would be a good... Native species, yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=451.541">Sorry.</a> </p>

    <p>[EO-vAhUJAKo_SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=454.843">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=455.824">I'm</a>  happy with that language to be inserted into this order of conditions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=461.287">I'm</a>  fine.</p>

    <p>[Denis MacDougall]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=461.787">I</a>  agree. <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=463.508">Great.</a> </p>

    <p>[EO-vAhUJAKo_SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=464.848">Do</a>  I have a motion? <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=471.064">I'll</a>  make a motion to approve the abbreviated notice of intent for 171 Arlington Street with the one additional special condition that all vegetation other than the grass be a native species.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001777_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=484.268">I'll</a>  second that.</p>

    <p>[Heidi Davis]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=489.63">Great</a>  motion, by the way. <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=492.911">All</a>  in favor? <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=494.171">Eric?</a> </p>

    <p>[MCM00001777_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=495.252">Aye.</a> </p>

    <p>[Heidi Davis]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=496.212">Jeremy?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=496.652">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=498.413">Heather?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=498.733">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=500.324">Caroline,</a>  I, and myself as an I. Okay.</p>

    <p>[Denis MacDougall]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=515.854">So,</a>  that's pretty much, I'm trying to think, while I was out, <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=521.659">One</a>  of the interns told me that we did get a call from someone who is going to be filing something, but I didn't get any further information. <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=528.042">They</a>  just asked about our schedule and where the app would see info on the city's website, and they were told yes, so they said they'll contact me if anything's going to come further. <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=538.386">I</a>  also did get an email from a gentleman on West Street who is interested in doing work on an existing property there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=545.138">Um,</a>  which is along the river, so, um, but he's going to come in and sort of show me what he's thinking and then sort of go over what is and isn't allowed and the likelihood of needing at the very least and RDA more likely. <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=558.63">And</a>  I don't know why.</p>

    <p>[Heather]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=562.578">So</a>  our next meeting is on the 15th, and I thought that you thought we would have some business?</p>

    <p>[Denis MacDougall]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=569.36">I</a>  thought we were going to get a filing for, we still might if we get it today, but I doubt it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=575.261">But</a>  up at Wright's Pond, they're basically removing the existing benches and putting in new benches, which involves just basically removing these ones and putting the new ones in with pads for the existing benches.</p>

    <p>[Heather]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=592.706">Was</a>  today the last day that it could be submitted for the 15th?</p>

    <p>[Denis MacDougall]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=596.33">Pretty</a>  much. <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=597.411">If</a>  it comes in tomorrow, I could still get it in.</p>

    <p>[Heather]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=601.876">I</a>  have a selfish reason for asking. <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=604.438">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=605.579">If</a>  it isn't, can you let me know?</p>

    <p>[Denis MacDougall]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=607.621">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Heather]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/conservation-commission-10-01-25&start=608.847">Because</a>  I can go out to dinner that night.</p>
