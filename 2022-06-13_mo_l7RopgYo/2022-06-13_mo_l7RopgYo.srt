1
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:11,162
[SPEAKER_20]: that the network was chosen from a total of 580 applicants.

2
00:00:11,682 --> 00:00:18,864
[SPEAKER_20]: They plan on using this funding over the next two to five years in order to better connect with families in our community.

3
00:00:20,445 --> 00:00:25,667
[SPEAKER_20]: I also wanted to recognize Mr. Tremonti's eighth grade class at the Hamptons Middle School.

4
00:00:26,407 --> 00:00:29,688
[SPEAKER_20]: They shared their civics project with me.

5
00:00:29,708 --> 00:00:32,289
[SPEAKER_20]: The students developed a banner which promotes

6
00:00:36,732 --> 00:00:41,816
[SPEAKER_20]: As one of the quotes on the banner states, when we all give, all gain.

7
00:00:42,396 --> 00:00:47,080
[SPEAKER_20]: The banner can be seen as one enters the foyer of the Andrews Middle School.

8
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:08,838
[SPEAKER_20]: and unfortunately they did lose three to two, but congratulations nonetheless.

9
00:01:09,559 --> 00:01:14,503
[SPEAKER_20]: And likewise, the boys played Westside High School in West Springfield.

10
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:27,533
[SPEAKER_20]: And unfortunately they did lose as well with a 10 to five, but despite the losses, we are very proud of all of the spring sport athletes within Medford Public Schools.

11
00:01:28,094 --> 00:01:30,956
[SPEAKER_20]: So again, those of you who are interested in sports,

12
00:01:32,438 --> 00:01:37,446
[SPEAKER_20]: The fall sports season that's coming up the portal will be open, and you'll be able to register there.

13
00:01:39,068 --> 00:01:41,092
[SPEAKER_20]: I wanted to also thank the class of 2020.

14
00:01:43,342 --> 00:01:47,505
[SPEAKER_20]: This was the first graduating class that was impacted by COVID-19.

15
00:01:48,646 --> 00:01:59,733
[SPEAKER_20]: This class could not celebrate their graduation with a prom, a barbecue, senior breakfast, and an in-person graduation ceremony.

16
00:02:00,694 --> 00:02:07,078
[SPEAKER_20]: Despite missing all of this, they still wanted to leave something behind for future generations of Mustangs.

17
00:02:08,846 --> 00:02:29,799
[SPEAKER_20]: Last Thursday, Mayor Rungelkorn, Dr. Cushing, Assistant Principal Bloch, the 2020 class advisors, Mr. Joseph Donlon and Mrs. Nancy Donlon, and the 2020 class president, Mark Allen Jean-Marie, and Class Secretary Elijah Fortune.

18
00:02:30,679 --> 00:02:34,742
[SPEAKER_20]: They helped to unveil a beautiful Mustang statue.

19
00:02:35,242 --> 00:02:38,024
[SPEAKER_20]: It's placed near the entrance to the Caron Theater.

20
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:51,536
[SPEAKER_20]: The plaque that accompanies this beautiful bust of a Mustang head says in recognition of the class of 2020 Medford High School Medford vocational technical high school.

21
00:02:52,457 --> 00:02:57,822
[SPEAKER_20]: We remember your strength resilience and unending commitment to our school community.

22
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:08,285
[SPEAKER_20]: You so ably demonstrated the true meaning of Mustang spirit, setting an example for alumni and the many students to follow.

23
00:03:09,426 --> 00:03:23,389
[SPEAKER_20]: Special thanks to Mr. Devaney of Oak Grove Memorials for designing the marble base that supports the bust and giving the school a significant discount.

24
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:28,935
[SPEAKER_20]: to have that bust displayed beautifully in the foyer area.

25
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:39,407
[SPEAKER_20]: So last week, we had the opportunity to enjoy some events that in the past we would have missed out on.

26
00:03:41,047 --> 00:03:47,834
[SPEAKER_20]: We celebrated our Junior Olympics at Hormel Stadium with fifth graders.

27
00:03:48,735 --> 00:03:50,677
[SPEAKER_20]: It was an absolutely beautiful day.

28
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:58,044
[SPEAKER_20]: Member Graham, Member McLaughlin, Mayor McLaughlin, Mayor Lungo-Koehn, Member McLaughlin.

29
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:16,645
[SPEAKER_20]: Our athletic department, our phys ed teachers, all of our elementary principals, the students, they had the opportunity to really participate in Olympic sports, run around, the teams were mixed up so they got to see

30
00:04:18,388 --> 00:04:22,855
[SPEAKER_20]: new friends and people that they will be together with next year when they go to middle school.

31
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:30,409
[SPEAKER_20]: So there were a lot of parents PTO was actively involved, and it was truly a great event for all.

32
00:04:32,265 --> 00:04:38,289
[SPEAKER_20]: I also wanted to say that last week we had a wonderful celebration at the new library.

33
00:04:38,309 --> 00:04:41,011
[SPEAKER_20]: It was the elementary read-a-thon.

34
00:04:41,892 --> 00:04:52,379
[SPEAKER_20]: And at last count, that read-a-thon raised over $31,000 from all of the four elementary schools.

35
00:04:52,799 --> 00:04:55,741
[SPEAKER_20]: The students did an outstanding job reading.

36
00:04:56,841 --> 00:04:57,982
[SPEAKER_20]: over two to three weeks.

37
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:16,006
[SPEAKER_20]: And I want to thank member Graham was there may along will Kern was there as well, recognizing our students giving them treats, and just thanking them for reading taking on that challenge, and not to let reading go by the wayside.

38
00:05:16,086 --> 00:05:18,067
[SPEAKER_20]: I also want to thank the library staff

39
00:05:18,828 --> 00:05:21,613
[SPEAKER_20]: for allowing us to use their beautiful facility.

40
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:28,969
[SPEAKER_20]: It was a wonderful event, recognizing students from pre-kinder all the way up through fifth grade.

41
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:39,363
[SPEAKER_20]: This week and next week are going to be moving on ceremonies for our eighth graders, for our fifth graders.

42
00:05:39,883 --> 00:05:48,407
[SPEAKER_20]: So there are definitely a lot of moving on ceremonies that are coming up and we will have those specific dates posted.

43
00:05:48,427 --> 00:05:51,748
[SPEAKER_20]: They'll be going out to the community.

44
00:05:51,848 --> 00:05:57,731
[SPEAKER_20]: So depending on which school, they're all different dates, but it's a wonderful time of year.

45
00:05:59,391 --> 00:06:00,172
[SPEAKER_04]: I also want to.

46
00:06:00,192 --> 00:06:02,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Superintendent, can I just stop you for a second?

47
00:06:02,353 --> 00:06:02,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, please.

48
00:06:03,513 --> 00:06:05,814
[SPEAKER_04]: There is some confusion about the proper Zoom link.

49
00:06:05,894 --> 00:06:17,180
[SPEAKER_04]: The one on our agenda is apparently not the Zoom link that we are in right now and there are people looking at the Zoom link on the agenda and waiting to get into that meeting.

50
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:22,223
[SPEAKER_04]: So, can we take a five-minute motion to recess?

51
00:06:22,303 --> 00:06:26,885
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to take a two to five-minute recess until we figure this out, please.

52
00:06:27,421 --> 00:06:29,264
[SPEAKER_15]: by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Graham.

53
00:06:29,284 --> 00:06:30,005
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

54
00:06:30,025 --> 00:06:30,466
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

55
00:06:30,546 --> 00:06:31,227
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

56
00:06:31,367 --> 00:06:32,969
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's get this together.

57
00:13:05,822 --> 00:13:07,643
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry, sorry, false alarm.

58
00:13:07,743 --> 00:13:08,444
[SPEAKER_15]: You have another minute.

59
00:13:08,884 --> 00:13:10,785
[SPEAKER_15]: Dr. Edouard-Vincent, let's finish up.

60
00:13:11,266 --> 00:13:11,626
[SPEAKER_20]: Sorry.

61
00:13:12,286 --> 00:13:19,031
[SPEAKER_20]: The last piece that I said was that there will be multiple moving on ceremonies at both the fifth and eighth grades.

62
00:13:20,012 --> 00:13:28,497
[SPEAKER_20]: Please look out for school-based communications so you can have the exact time and location at your respective schools.

63
00:13:29,598 --> 00:13:34,603
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, we will be since this is the final regular meeting of the year.

64
00:13:35,244 --> 00:13:39,808
[SPEAKER_20]: This is our last Monday of being in school before the school year lets out.

65
00:13:41,089 --> 00:13:46,534
[SPEAKER_20]: We will have summer fun camp starting on July 5 at the miss a tuck.

66
00:13:47,936 --> 00:13:49,537
[SPEAKER_20]: And then there will be plenty of

67
00:13:51,914 --> 00:14:00,757
[SPEAKER_20]: clinics being offered this summer for any of our athletes volleyball girls lacrosse, basketball, soccer.

68
00:14:01,518 --> 00:14:08,841
[SPEAKER_20]: So please go to the school blog to find out the information for that Medford rec and the Maldon why.

69
00:14:09,881 --> 00:14:21,951
[SPEAKER_20]: At the GMAC gym, and the new Medford public library, they are hosting many summer events, so please take advantage of that as well look at their respective websites.

70
00:14:22,472 --> 00:14:28,056
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to wish all of our dads out there a happy Father's Day, this coming Sunday, this coming Sunday.

71
00:14:28,817 --> 00:14:29,718
[SPEAKER_20]: June 19.

72
00:14:30,299 --> 00:14:36,305
[SPEAKER_20]: I also want to just remind everyone that June 19 is Juneteenth.

73
00:14:37,546 --> 00:14:40,410
[SPEAKER_20]: It became a federal holiday last year.

74
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:44,554
[SPEAKER_20]: The name is the blending of the words June and 19th.

75
00:14:46,607 --> 00:15:00,416
[SPEAKER_20]: It commemorates June 19th, 1865, the day that the Union Army Major General Gordon Granger rode into Galveston, Texas and told slaves of their emancipation.

76
00:15:01,456 --> 00:15:10,382
[SPEAKER_20]: That day came more than two years after President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1st, 1863.

77
00:15:13,678 --> 00:15:21,183
[SPEAKER_20]: even after Lincoln declared all enslaved people free on paper that hadn't necessarily been the case in practice.

78
00:15:22,364 --> 00:15:30,670
[SPEAKER_20]: Juneteenth is also known as Emancipation Day, Jubilee Day, Freedom Day, and Black Independence Day.

79
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:36,955
[SPEAKER_20]: People across the country celebrate with food and festivities, much like the 4th of July.

80
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:44,659
[SPEAKER_20]: In celebration of Juneteenth, schools will be closed on Monday, June 20th.

81
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:53,924
[SPEAKER_20]: School will resume on Tuesday, the 21st, and our last day of school is Thursday, June 23rd.

82
00:15:54,824 --> 00:15:59,767
[SPEAKER_20]: So as I said, this is our last regular school committee meeting of the year.

83
00:16:00,147 --> 00:16:03,809
[SPEAKER_20]: We will be scheduling additional meetings, which we mentioned earlier.

84
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:07,351
[SPEAKER_20]: I especially want to thank

85
00:16:09,358 --> 00:16:14,942
[SPEAKER_20]: all of our students and staff, as well as our school committee for another successful school year.

86
00:16:16,323 --> 00:16:21,888
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to congratulate our educators and staff who are retiring this year.

87
00:16:21,908 --> 00:16:35,157
[SPEAKER_20]: And since we are still finalizing details on this list, we will be individually recognizing all of our retirees at our first meeting officially in September.

88
00:16:36,499 --> 00:16:36,899
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

89
00:16:38,695 --> 00:16:39,936
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

90
00:16:41,056 --> 00:16:44,157
[SPEAKER_15]: Number two, CPAC end of year report presented by Ms.

91
00:16:44,377 --> 00:16:46,198

00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:50,520
[SPEAKER_15]: Tanya Sullivan, co-chairs of the Special Education Parent Advisory Council.

93
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,160
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome.

94
00:17:01,285 --> 00:17:05,947
[SPEAKER_15]: Press the button, the second button in, or we can have Mr. McLaughlin turn that on for you.

95
00:17:06,786 --> 00:17:07,106
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

96
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:07,886
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, there we go.

97
00:17:08,006 --> 00:17:08,767
[SPEAKER_15]: There's the red light.

98
00:17:10,167 --> 00:17:13,028
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening, Mayor, Superintendent, school committee members.

99
00:17:13,788 --> 00:17:15,649
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for having us present at this meeting.

100
00:17:16,789 --> 00:17:19,470
[SPEAKER_11]: Medford Special Education Parent Advisory Council.

101
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:21,851
[SPEAKER_11]: We've been busy this year.

102
00:17:21,871 --> 00:17:24,652
[SPEAKER_11]: The presentation.

103
00:17:24,672 --> 00:17:24,752
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

104
00:17:25,672 --> 00:17:25,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

105
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:41,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor, while we're waiting for the presentation, can I ask a question?

106
00:17:42,117 --> 00:17:45,420
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, I think Dr. Cushing is working on getting the presentation up.

107
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,240
[SPEAKER_15]: Member McLaughlin?

108
00:17:46,501 --> 00:17:46,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

109
00:17:47,482 --> 00:17:50,965
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just curious about how many students, and I suppose Ms.

110
00:17:51,005 --> 00:17:56,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Bowen can answer, about how many students are receiving special education services in Medford Public Schools?

111
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,892
[SPEAKER_09]: We have approximately 840 students who are receiving services.

112
00:17:58,912 --> 00:17:59,553
[SPEAKER_09]: 840 out of the roughly 4,000?

113
00:17:59,593 --> 00:17:59,653
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

114
00:17:59,673 --> 00:18:00,134
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thank you.

115
00:18:27,334 --> 00:18:27,694
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

116
00:18:30,936 --> 00:18:31,296
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect.

117
00:18:32,956 --> 00:18:33,757
[SPEAKER_06]: Go to the next one.

118
00:18:34,917 --> 00:18:35,237
Slide.

119
00:18:36,358 --> 00:18:41,240
[SPEAKER_11]: So the CPAC board members consists of myself, Tanya Sullivan, Alex Lorik.

120
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,500
[SPEAKER_11]: We're both the co-chairs.

121
00:18:43,601 --> 00:18:45,562
[SPEAKER_11]: Jamil Webb Davis is the treasurer.

122
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:48,183
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe she's going by Jamil Johnson now.

123
00:18:49,303 --> 00:18:51,524
[SPEAKER_11]: Secretary is Anne Herzog Russo.

124
00:18:52,672 --> 00:19:00,538
[SPEAKER_11]: The membership includes students, and it includes families and guardians of children on IEPs and 504s, and other interested parties.

125
00:19:01,658 --> 00:19:17,329
[SPEAKER_11]: At Medford CPAC, we're always looking for parents, guardians of children with special needs, and other interested parties to join us and be a part of the community, to work with us even on a volunteer basis, to help us with some of the presentations and activities that we'd like to put on for the community.

126
00:19:18,453 --> 00:19:26,137
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you'd like to learn more about how to get involved with Medford CPAC, please email us at medford.cpac at gmail.com.

127
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:34,601
[SPEAKER_11]: For those that don't know what Medford CPAC is, our mission, what is CPAC?

128
00:19:34,621 --> 00:19:44,886
[SPEAKER_11]: The purpose is for us to fulfill the directive stated in Chapter 71B of the Massachusetts General Laws, which requires a school district to establish a PAC

129
00:19:45,492 --> 00:19:49,474
[SPEAKER_11]: and assigns both an advisory and a participatory function to the PAC.

130
00:19:50,595 --> 00:20:05,662
[SPEAKER_11]: In meeting this requirement, the mission of the Medford Special Education Parent Advisory Council is to advise the district on matters that pertain to the education and safety of students with disabilities by seeking input from the special education parent members.

131
00:20:06,943 --> 00:20:15,207
[SPEAKER_11]: Meet regularly with school officials to participate in the planning, development, and evaluation of the school district's special education program

132
00:20:16,186 --> 00:20:21,148
[SPEAKER_11]: to participate in planning workshops and activities as prioritized by the CPAC board.

133
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:37,495
[SPEAKER_11]: Even though we did most of our presentations, actually all of our presentations this year via Zoom, we were actually very successful in presenting a lot of great topics and we had a really good turnout.

134
00:20:37,835 --> 00:20:41,676
[SPEAKER_11]: We do hope to go back to in-person for the next school year.

135
00:20:42,457 --> 00:20:43,517
[SPEAKER_11]: But the 2021-2022 school year highlights

136
00:20:46,516 --> 00:20:50,019
[SPEAKER_11]: We offered several content-rich presentations throughout the school year.

137
00:20:51,100 --> 00:21:00,188
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, our presentations, when we have speakers qualify as two PDPs for teachers and staff, if they attend the presentation.

138
00:21:00,848 --> 00:21:13,199
[SPEAKER_11]: And some of our topics included disability rights as human rights, understanding the IEP, understanding dyslexia, declarative language on and beyond the spectrum,

139
00:21:16,448 --> 00:21:29,415
[SPEAKER_11]: And then to continue in collaboration with the special education department CPAC presentations have highlighted initiatives in the district, as well as Medford specialists and special education service providers.

140
00:21:30,216 --> 00:21:40,582
[SPEAKER_11]: With the disability awareness initiatives in Medford public schools, and we had physical and occupational therapy district specialists present at the last presentation.

141
00:21:41,547 --> 00:21:47,328
[SPEAKER_11]: And we plan to continue our close collaboration with the district and add more such presentations in the new year.

142
00:21:51,509 --> 00:21:53,490
[SPEAKER_11]: CPAC concerns and recommendations.

143
00:21:53,790 --> 00:22:02,052
[SPEAKER_11]: So the CPAC is focused on moving forward the disability awareness training for staff and the disability awareness curriculum for students in all schools.

144
00:22:02,872 --> 00:22:05,412
[SPEAKER_11]: We are concerned that the 2021-2022 resulted in a pause of these initiatives.

145
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:13,713
[SPEAKER_11]: We hope the district recognizes the importance of these programs and is committed to their implementation.

146
00:22:15,054 --> 00:22:23,018
[SPEAKER_11]: We are concerned on how staff shortages, special education teachers, and special education paraprofessionals impact our students with disabilities.

147
00:22:23,819 --> 00:22:32,584
[SPEAKER_11]: We are further concerned regarding a shortage of substitute special education paraprofessionals, which impacts the ability to support students as specified in their IEPs.

148
00:22:34,369 --> 00:22:43,432
[SPEAKER_11]: In addition, CPAC was made aware of school policies which allow for disciplinary referrals and incident reports to be added to a student file without parental notification.

149
00:22:44,233 --> 00:22:51,676
[SPEAKER_11]: And just to clarify, it might be a misunderstanding or a miscommunication that's lending to that as well.

150
00:22:52,076 --> 00:22:57,218
[SPEAKER_11]: These policies have the potential to disproportionately impact students with high needs and their families.

151
00:22:57,738 --> 00:23:00,779
[SPEAKER_11]: We recommend the school committee strengthen the language of these policies

152
00:23:01,334 --> 00:23:10,461
[SPEAKER_11]: and introduce unambiguous conditions that trigger parental notifications so that the parents will have the same information that the administration and the school has.

153
00:23:11,822 --> 00:23:14,063
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we wanted to open up for any questions.

154
00:23:17,566 --> 00:23:18,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin.

155
00:23:19,107 --> 00:23:19,607
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

156
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:20,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for the presentation.

157
00:23:20,828 --> 00:23:22,410
[SPEAKER_05]: I always appreciate it.

158
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:25,332
[SPEAKER_05]: I do have a couple of questions if I can.

159
00:23:26,412 --> 00:23:29,275
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to ask, do you also advise and support

160
00:23:30,267 --> 00:23:34,790
[SPEAKER_05]: parents or caregivers with questions regarding special education supports and services.

161
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:38,833
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you guys take phone calls or talk to families about any of those needs?

162
00:23:39,374 --> 00:23:39,654
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

163
00:23:40,094 --> 00:23:58,068
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, we do talk to families separately and we are looking to, uh, next year open office hours, uh, so that families who may not be able to attend the meetings, um, will still be able to express their concerns, um, to the CPAC so that we can work with administration.

164
00:23:58,792 --> 00:24:00,972
[SPEAKER_11]: to make sure that the community is getting what they need.

165
00:24:00,992 --> 00:24:01,353
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

166
00:24:01,413 --> 00:24:03,493
[SPEAKER_05]: And next year is an election year, right?

167
00:24:03,813 --> 00:24:04,233
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah.

168
00:24:04,633 --> 00:24:14,235
[SPEAKER_05]: So for people that are interested in running, what should they do or how can they participate if they're interested in supporting either the CPAC board or running for any of the positions or what have you?

169
00:24:14,275 --> 00:24:15,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a way to be involved?

170
00:24:15,776 --> 00:24:16,276
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.

171
00:24:16,316 --> 00:24:17,776
[SPEAKER_11]: They can reach out to us directly.

172
00:24:18,216 --> 00:24:24,497
[SPEAKER_11]: They can either call us or they can email us at medford.cpac at gmail.com is probably the best way to get in touch with us.

173
00:24:24,877 --> 00:24:26,698
[SPEAKER_11]: We are always looking to grow the CPAC.

174
00:24:28,226 --> 00:24:40,348
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of people are always busy, everybody's busy, but taking the time to become a part of this, we all became a part of this because we had a concern about our own child.

175
00:24:41,889 --> 00:24:46,529
[SPEAKER_11]: And then when you get in, you realize that you can make a difference for a lot of children.

176
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:53,171
[SPEAKER_11]: And we would really appreciate any volunteers that can help in any capacity.

177
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:54,811
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't need to be every single

178
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:55,990
[SPEAKER_11]: meeting.

179
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:57,692
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't need to be every single event.

180
00:24:59,513 --> 00:25:02,715
[SPEAKER_11]: But any, any volunteers would be greatly appreciated.

181
00:25:03,035 --> 00:25:03,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

182
00:25:03,416 --> 00:25:10,661
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, you don't have to be a parent or a family member of a child with a disability, you can just be an interested party.

183
00:25:11,421 --> 00:25:12,702
[SPEAKER_05]: May I may I just have two more?

184
00:25:12,963 --> 00:25:13,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

185
00:25:13,243 --> 00:25:14,664
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, thank you.

186
00:25:15,304 --> 00:25:16,205
[SPEAKER_05]: I have three more actually.

187
00:25:16,245 --> 00:25:16,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

188
00:25:16,825 --> 00:25:22,749
[SPEAKER_05]: One is the next one is on have you guys done I know that there's a programmatic elements to the special education department.

189
00:25:22,769 --> 00:25:23,450
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are different

190
00:25:23,928 --> 00:25:28,449
[SPEAKER_05]: strands, if you will, of classrooms, of sub-separate classrooms in our district.

191
00:25:29,369 --> 00:25:35,651
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, an access program, connections program, therapeutic learning program, those sorts of things.

192
00:25:35,711 --> 00:25:39,271
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm wondering, does the CPAC do tours of those programs, strands at all?

193
00:25:39,291 --> 00:25:44,913
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you guys looked at, or are there tours available that you guys do do so that you're looking at the programmatic elements?

194
00:25:46,385 --> 00:25:51,070
[SPEAKER_11]: As CPAC, we haven't necessarily toured them, especially not in the last few years.

195
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:52,411
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess it's maybe a question for Ms.

196
00:25:52,431 --> 00:25:52,871
[SPEAKER_05]: Bowen.

197
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:55,374
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I mean, that is something that we're looking to do.

198
00:25:55,654 --> 00:26:08,246
[SPEAKER_11]: We would like to be able to do that so that we can have a better understanding and a better kind of vision so that when we're telling parents information about these programs, we're speaking from experience.

199
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:09,808
[SPEAKER_11]: We're speaking from what we're seeing.

200
00:26:09,828 --> 00:26:11,009
[SPEAKER_11]: We're speaking about what we know.

201
00:26:11,893 --> 00:26:13,914
[SPEAKER_11]: as opposed to what we know on paper.

202
00:26:14,034 --> 00:26:18,015
[SPEAKER_05]: And also the charter is to advise the district on matters pertaining to special education.

203
00:26:18,055 --> 00:26:21,736
[SPEAKER_11]: So you're seeing the classrooms and the environment and you can advise on what you're saying.

204
00:26:21,856 --> 00:26:22,216
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.

205
00:26:22,236 --> 00:26:35,599
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, some of us have seen, have seen these classrooms as a parent, you know, observer, but in a capacity to kind of speak to, you know, outward facing community, we would definitely need to see all of them.

206
00:26:36,259 --> 00:26:38,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that need to be a motion, Joan, or is that something that can

207
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:40,745
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that's something we can arrange.

208
00:26:40,906 --> 00:26:45,269
[SPEAKER_09]: We have had discussions prior to the school closure about having more students.

209
00:26:45,289 --> 00:26:47,712
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think we'll revisit it when things calm down.

210
00:26:47,912 --> 00:26:49,493
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

211
00:26:49,513 --> 00:26:51,235
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be in communication regarding that.

212
00:26:51,915 --> 00:26:52,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

213
00:26:52,296 --> 00:26:53,777
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if I can ask, I guess this is for Ms.

214
00:26:53,797 --> 00:26:59,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Bowen, how do we address the issue, concern number two, the staff shortages?

215
00:26:59,082 --> 00:27:05,448
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that it's COVID and this has been an issue across the country and I know that there's a lot of concern with

216
00:27:08,057 --> 00:27:25,818
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, first of all, just having special education paraprofessionals, but also having a substitute pool for them, because in a lot of instances, or some instances paraprofessionals are specifically part of the child's IEP, whether it's one-on-one or a classroom para, and so it's a legal requirement, obviously, that we have those paraprofessionals.

217
00:27:26,722 --> 00:27:28,643
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the plan to try to address that?

218
00:27:28,663 --> 00:27:31,025
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's the million dollar question.

219
00:27:31,085 --> 00:27:34,427
[SPEAKER_09]: We are working really hard to recruit more staff members.

220
00:27:35,307 --> 00:27:37,368
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been a struggle across all districts.

221
00:27:37,729 --> 00:27:40,330
[SPEAKER_09]: They're experiencing the same shortages that we are.

222
00:27:41,111 --> 00:27:51,277
[SPEAKER_09]: We're hoping with contract negotiations with the paraprofessionals, we wanna do more training with them as well to hope to get more paraprofessionals to come to the district.

223
00:27:52,352 --> 00:27:54,053
[SPEAKER_09]: We are advertising everywhere.

224
00:27:54,093 --> 00:28:05,881
[SPEAKER_09]: If people know someone who's interested in being a paraprofessional, please have them send in their resume to me, but we are constantly looking and using all platforms that we possibly can to hire and recruit.

225
00:28:06,442 --> 00:28:17,349
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think just on the, and this might be a Mr. Murphy question sort of issue that was brought up, but I think on the paraprofessional, I was told, I think by a paraprofessional or someone,

226
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, that's, I think it's no longer with the district.

227
00:28:19,751 --> 00:28:24,372
[SPEAKER_05]: If you are out sick, there's not an option for a substitute button or something like that.

228
00:28:24,432 --> 00:28:24,892
[SPEAKER_09]: I forget.

229
00:28:25,312 --> 00:28:25,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.

230
00:28:25,632 --> 00:28:42,558
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, when, uh, when a power is absent, there's not, um, but we have created these open positions that when we know that there is a need for a power in one of our substant substantially separate programs or a student that requires, we are trying to get someone to cover that paraprofessional.

231
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:42,778
[SPEAKER_09]: So,

232
00:28:43,393 --> 00:28:49,116
[SPEAKER_09]: It's moving pieces, but there's not a lot of staff that we're able to move around at this point.

233
00:28:49,136 --> 00:28:51,977
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we can check in on that again mid-year or something next year.

234
00:28:51,997 --> 00:28:53,778
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I promised my last question, colleagues.

235
00:28:54,678 --> 00:28:56,359
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for indulging me.

236
00:28:57,459 --> 00:28:58,460
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, it's a motion.

237
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:12,426
[SPEAKER_05]: It's on your last recommendation regarding the incident and discipline reports that are created and put in students' files that can disproportionately impact students with high needs.

238
00:29:13,158 --> 00:29:20,082
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to make a motion that this issue be referred to the Rules, Policy, and Equity Subcommittee to review.

239
00:29:20,723 --> 00:29:23,565
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm wondering if I might have a second for my, thank you.

240
00:29:23,965 --> 00:29:26,566
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Mustone.

241
00:29:26,646 --> 00:29:27,367
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

242
00:29:27,547 --> 00:29:28,808
[SPEAKER_15]: Can I speak on that, actually?

243
00:29:29,248 --> 00:29:31,329
[SPEAKER_15]: Before the roll is called, Member Ruseau.

244
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:32,450
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, actually.

245
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:33,951
[SPEAKER_19]: My question was actually about that.

246
00:29:36,332 --> 00:29:36,933
[SPEAKER_19]: Do you have

247
00:29:37,719 --> 00:29:41,364
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, you reference policies, do you actually know what the policies are?

248
00:29:42,004 --> 00:29:42,905
[SPEAKER_19]: Like, is there a list?

249
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:53,959
[SPEAKER_02]: So the policy is in the handbooks, the school handbooks, and I look at most of them, I look at elementary and middle school handbooks.

250
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,862
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, when you go on the website,

251
00:29:57,955 --> 00:30:00,797
[SPEAKER_02]: I think none of the school has the most current handout.

252
00:30:01,578 --> 00:30:04,120
[SPEAKER_02]: They are called different way, different names.

253
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:08,043
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's the family handbook, it's the student handbook, it's the student and parents handbook.

254
00:30:08,063 --> 00:30:08,923
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is confusing.

255
00:30:10,104 --> 00:30:13,487
[SPEAKER_02]: And then most are two years old.

256
00:30:13,627 --> 00:30:19,871
[SPEAKER_02]: I asked Mr. Tucci, so for the McGlynn Middle School, I have reviewed the latest just to make sure that there is not

257
00:30:21,004 --> 00:30:22,204
[SPEAKER_02]: like a difference in language.

258
00:30:22,664 --> 00:30:26,045
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, so I look at the handbooks that I don't know if there is any other rule.

259
00:30:26,365 --> 00:30:32,647
[SPEAKER_02]: And the handbook says that referrals may result in pattern notification, but they don't have to result in pattern notification.

260
00:30:33,027 --> 00:30:39,488
[SPEAKER_02]: And also there's the confusion regarding disciplinary referrals and incidents reports.

261
00:30:39,868 --> 00:30:48,931
[SPEAKER_02]: The handbooks seem to suggest that the incident reports are only filed for like very serious offenses like drug issues or harassment.

262
00:30:49,231 --> 00:30:50,571
[SPEAKER_02]: But in reality, it seems that

263
00:30:51,877 --> 00:30:53,458
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not only that.

264
00:30:53,578 --> 00:30:55,438
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's the language is very confusing.

265
00:30:55,498 --> 00:30:58,700
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the issue itself, for me, at least what's very confusing.

266
00:30:59,060 --> 00:30:59,940
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, certainly.

267
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:04,362
[SPEAKER_19]: The issue of the handbooks being outdated in our website.

268
00:31:05,262 --> 00:31:06,583
[SPEAKER_19]: I won't get into the website right now.

269
00:31:06,903 --> 00:31:11,144
[SPEAKER_19]: But, um, so I think that I certainly support the motion.

270
00:31:11,184 --> 00:31:11,965
[SPEAKER_19]: I just think that

271
00:31:14,349 --> 00:31:26,835
[SPEAKER_19]: we need to know which policies we're reviewing, because I don't think it's appropriate to cast a net where the rules and policy subcommittee should essentially review the whole handbook, because the committee- Point of information.

272
00:31:26,855 --> 00:31:28,215
[SPEAKER_19]: Approves the handbooks.

273
00:31:28,916 --> 00:31:29,676
[SPEAKER_15]: Point of information.

274
00:31:30,036 --> 00:31:30,916
[SPEAKER_15]: Point of information.

275
00:31:31,317 --> 00:31:32,497
[SPEAKER_15]: Your question, Member McLaughlin?

276
00:31:33,177 --> 00:31:40,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well, I guess it's more, not a question, but a clarification for the point of information is that- It's a point of clarification.

277
00:31:40,441 --> 00:31:43,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, a point of clarification where you are asking specifically

278
00:31:43,499 --> 00:31:52,865
[SPEAKER_05]: I am asking specifically that the policy for disciplinary referrals and incident reports allow for parental notification.

279
00:31:53,285 --> 00:32:05,792
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can, I think it's our job to find out what the current policy is that exists in both our online policy and rules and policy handbook, as well as the student handbooks and make sure that those are consistent.

280
00:32:06,252 --> 00:32:10,095
[SPEAKER_05]: But essentially I can speak from personal experience regarding incident reports.

281
00:32:11,007 --> 00:32:17,429
[SPEAKER_05]: We had multiple that we were frankly unaware of until we were leaving the district and became aware of them.

282
00:32:17,889 --> 00:32:24,690
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's not the way one wants to find out, especially when we want to support our students while they're in school.

283
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:39,874
[SPEAKER_05]: So the motion is specifically addressing a referral to the rules, policy and equity subcommittee to review disciplinary referrals and incident reports so that those are shared with parental notification.

284
00:32:40,622 --> 00:32:48,806
[SPEAKER_05]: because that seems not to either be an existing policy in the current rules policy and equity listing and or some vagary in the student handbook.

285
00:32:49,146 --> 00:32:50,287
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's my specific.

286
00:32:51,708 --> 00:32:52,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that helpful?

287
00:32:52,408 --> 00:32:52,768
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor?

288
00:32:53,949 --> 00:32:56,450
[SPEAKER_15]: Before the roll call, Member Ruseau, are you all set?

289
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:57,810
[SPEAKER_15]: No, but I can wait.

290
00:32:58,171 --> 00:33:00,392
[SPEAKER_15]: You'll yield to Member Graham?

291
00:33:01,676 --> 00:33:16,027
[SPEAKER_04]: I was wondering if the communication and family engagement subcommittee was the more appropriate committee to send this to, given that what we're talking about is parental communication.

292
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:22,092
[SPEAKER_04]: So just a suggestion that we find the right committee for it to go to.

293
00:33:23,293 --> 00:33:23,894
[SPEAKER_15]: May I respond?

294
00:33:26,135 --> 00:33:27,376
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Ruseau will yield to you.

295
00:33:27,416 --> 00:33:28,057
[SPEAKER_15]: Member McLaughlin.

296
00:33:28,541 --> 00:33:28,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

297
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:33,304
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate that through the chair, member Graham, that this is a family communication.

298
00:33:33,424 --> 00:33:43,350
[SPEAKER_05]: It is also policy specifically regarding disciplinary referrals and incident reports, because those policies do go into the student file.

299
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:46,812
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a policy in terms of what's in the file, not just the family engagement.

300
00:33:47,573 --> 00:33:51,315
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that there's a step that can be missed there if it's not part of policy.

301
00:33:52,096 --> 00:33:57,479
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that I spoke with one of our administrators about what the existing policy is around the structure of this.

302
00:33:58,246 --> 00:34:02,208
[SPEAKER_05]: have been told that there isn't one in terms of what the process is.

303
00:34:02,568 --> 00:34:11,433
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think there's a couple of issues to be addressed, but I would say, I think it's the policy subcommittee because we really need to create a policy since there isn't one that exists.

304
00:34:12,433 --> 00:34:12,653
[SPEAKER_19]: Mayor.

305
00:34:14,274 --> 00:34:14,574
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

306
00:34:14,654 --> 00:34:15,955
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Ruseau.

307
00:34:16,343 --> 00:34:16,663
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

308
00:34:16,803 --> 00:34:21,627
[SPEAKER_19]: So I did find the incident reports policy, which I will admit, I did not know we had.

309
00:34:22,728 --> 00:34:34,538
[SPEAKER_19]: And in fact, it does reference serious incidents, but what is fascinating about it is that nowhere in there, is there any suggestion that the family should be communicated with?

310
00:34:34,998 --> 00:34:45,907
[SPEAKER_19]: So if we can, a friendly amendment to actually specify the particular policy, because I just don't wanna, I don't want a motion where it's like, I'm just hunting all the policies.

311
00:34:46,232 --> 00:34:46,893
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's agreed.

312
00:34:46,913 --> 00:34:47,773
[SPEAKER_05]: You can include that.

313
00:34:48,053 --> 00:34:48,954
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the policy number?

314
00:34:48,974 --> 00:34:50,875
[SPEAKER_19]: Policy CLB incident report.

315
00:34:51,135 --> 00:34:51,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Say it again.

316
00:34:51,836 --> 00:34:53,477
[SPEAKER_19]: CLB is the policy ID.

317
00:34:53,517 --> 00:34:54,578
[SPEAKER_19]: It's incident report.

318
00:34:54,678 --> 00:34:55,959
[SPEAKER_05]: CLB incident reports.

319
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,740
[SPEAKER_05]: I will amend that to the motion.

320
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:58,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

321
00:35:03,984 --> 00:35:05,005
[SPEAKER_06]: Should I read the motion?

322
00:35:06,066 --> 00:35:06,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

323
00:35:08,047 --> 00:35:08,347
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, yes.

324
00:35:08,567 --> 00:35:10,949
[SPEAKER_15]: Just want to make sure your microphone's on, please.

325
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:22,635
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to make sure that the issue is not only the incident report, but also the referral report, which seem to be different, the disciplinary referral, which is communication between staff.

326
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:23,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

327
00:35:24,096 --> 00:35:27,617
[SPEAKER_02]: And may or may not have an incident report.

328
00:35:28,457 --> 00:35:40,022
[SPEAKER_11]: And the referral seems to be, it doesn't necessarily need to be with something, you know, very aggressive, but it seems to be the way that it's communicated throughout administration.

329
00:35:40,363 --> 00:35:40,943
[SPEAKER_11]: It's almost like a,

330
00:35:42,012 --> 00:35:48,735
[SPEAKER_11]: communication process more so than a like an incident report similar to an incident report.

331
00:35:48,755 --> 00:35:52,717
[SPEAKER_11]: So it seems very different but sometimes those words are used interchangeably.

332
00:35:52,877 --> 00:35:55,939
[SPEAKER_02]: And it does go in the student record.

333
00:35:57,779 --> 00:35:58,560
[SPEAKER_15]: Member McLaughlin?

334
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:11,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes and also you know just to make matters a little bit more confusing and I know the Director of Pupil Services knows this but not necessarily all educators know

335
00:36:12,162 --> 00:36:20,248
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, that the disciplinary referrals for students with disabilities has some requirements and some structure.

336
00:36:20,548 --> 00:36:25,992
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, especially regarding suspension and expulsion and some other issues.

337
00:36:26,012 --> 00:36:27,793
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's some nuances around this.

338
00:36:27,873 --> 00:36:41,163
[SPEAKER_05]: So if there is not an existing policy, it may be that this should go to the special education subcommittee first to think about what the nuances are around the disciplinary referrals,

339
00:36:41,749 --> 00:36:49,878
[SPEAKER_05]: specific to the special education law and how that can be communicated.

340
00:36:50,319 --> 00:36:54,323
[SPEAKER_05]: So if I can, if my colleagues are in agreement, I think I might split the motion.

341
00:36:54,343 --> 00:37:00,931
[SPEAKER_15]: Before you split the motion, I think Dr. Edouard-Vincent wants to comment.

342
00:37:01,533 --> 00:37:06,519
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I just wanted to comment because as I'm listening to the conversation.

343
00:37:06,539 --> 00:37:15,490
[SPEAKER_20]: I definitely am in support of visiting the incident reports in correcting the language for the disciplinary referrals piece.

344
00:37:18,536 --> 00:37:24,000
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not really clear in terms of what it is specifically that you're asking and I'm just thinking about.

345
00:37:25,541 --> 00:37:32,505
[SPEAKER_20]: Is this something that's going to be putting an additional burden on the classroom teachers.

346
00:37:33,346 --> 00:37:43,412
[SPEAKER_20]: If, if you know something that like a very minor infraction takes place in the classroom that it's it's documented but to say every single time.

347
00:37:44,973 --> 00:38:09,954
[SPEAKER_20]: something happens that there's parent notification so I, I am in support of sending it to the subcommittee to try to unpack it and unpack it in terms of a reasonable way parents definitely are notified I know when there are serious infractions that take place, but I just don't want it to be something where it's something that's so minor and.

348
00:38:10,735 --> 00:38:21,164
[SPEAKER_20]: It's, it's addressed but it ends up now being an additional demand in terms of students with disabilities member McLaughlin.

349
00:38:22,225 --> 00:38:28,570
[SPEAKER_20]: We definitely work with building based special education administrators and.

350
00:38:30,471 --> 00:38:38,278
[SPEAKER_20]: The administrators also know that there are special rules, different rules, rules for students with disabilities regarding suspension.

351
00:38:38,878 --> 00:38:42,421
[SPEAKER_20]: So that is really on everyone's radar.

352
00:38:43,022 --> 00:38:44,343
[SPEAKER_20]: And if in fact.

353
00:38:46,164 --> 00:38:54,390
[SPEAKER_20]: discipline stronger discipline needs to be meted out, then we definitely consult with special education administrators, prior to that taking place.

354
00:38:55,010 --> 00:39:03,716
[SPEAKER_20]: So I just wanted to say that it is something that we're aware of and miss Bowen is here she can speak to that as well.

355
00:39:05,345 --> 00:39:25,712
[SPEAKER_20]: I just wanted to comment so that you're aware I am willing to, you know, address the incident reports and get the policy formally revised, but I am cautious about saying every single thing needs to be revised because we do need to document

356
00:39:27,059 --> 00:39:31,321
[SPEAKER_20]: but not everything is worthy of, you know, a phone call calling the parent immediately.

357
00:39:32,541 --> 00:39:35,822
[SPEAKER_20]: Cause it's, it's something else that we would be adding to the instructional day.

358
00:39:35,842 --> 00:39:36,743
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

359
00:39:37,663 --> 00:39:38,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin.

360
00:39:38,803 --> 00:39:39,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

361
00:39:39,303 --> 00:39:40,324
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, superintendent.

362
00:39:40,944 --> 00:39:48,827
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to mention as well, though, that if the, if the document, even if it's a minor infraction, if it's going in the students,

363
00:39:49,685 --> 00:40:00,091
[SPEAKER_05]: record and can affect the students placement potentially, among other things, then it does feel like it should be something that the parents are notified.

364
00:40:00,151 --> 00:40:04,473
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think that this is a discussion, a longer discussion for another day.

365
00:40:04,593 --> 00:40:07,535
[SPEAKER_05]: So if I might, I would like to split the motion so that

366
00:40:08,174 --> 00:40:21,317
[SPEAKER_05]: We refer the incident report motion to the rules, the policy and equity subcommittee based on the policy DLB incidents that member Rousseau just mentioned.

367
00:40:21,437 --> 00:40:37,121
[SPEAKER_05]: And then my second motion for the split would be that we refer disciplinary referrals to the special education subcommittee meeting to work a little bit more on the language and work with collaborate with the superintendent and director of pupil services to

368
00:40:37,697 --> 00:40:42,999
[SPEAKER_05]: better understand why CPAC is specifically making this recommendation.

369
00:40:43,019 --> 00:40:44,519
[SPEAKER_05]: If I could have a second.

370
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:49,501
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion for approval by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Mustone.

371
00:40:50,341 --> 00:40:51,061
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

372
00:40:52,022 --> 00:40:52,122
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

373
00:40:52,442 --> 00:40:53,062
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

374
00:40:53,282 --> 00:40:53,962
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

375
00:40:55,743 --> 00:40:57,444
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Mustone.

376
00:40:57,464 --> 00:41:04,906
[SPEAKER_22]: I also want to just thank you all because I think it's been years that you were lobbying for the adaptive physical education teacher.

377
00:41:05,461 --> 00:41:10,645
[SPEAKER_22]: And this past year has been awesome with the United basketball program that I know Miss Kyla Andre ran.

378
00:41:10,985 --> 00:41:18,710
[SPEAKER_22]: And so I just want people to know that CPAC really gets stuff done and that if they're looking to get something done to join your group, because you guys are the best.

379
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:19,931
[SPEAKER_22]: So thank you for being here.

380
00:41:31,578 --> 00:41:47,185
[SPEAKER_20]: I just wanted to say thank you as well to CPAC for your continued partnership with Medford Public Schools, including us, notifying us of all of your meetings and giving us an opportunity to communicate more widely with the entire community.

381
00:41:47,325 --> 00:41:48,345
[SPEAKER_20]: So thank you for that.

382
00:41:48,445 --> 00:41:52,507
[SPEAKER_20]: And I look forward to our continued partnership moving next year.

383
00:41:52,807 --> 00:41:55,768
[SPEAKER_05]: And I believe we have a presentation to a member of the community.

384
00:41:55,788 --> 00:41:55,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

385
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:14,754
[SPEAKER_11]: Every year we like to award a member of the community that makes a difference for our kids and the community basically.

386
00:42:16,334 --> 00:42:22,877
[SPEAKER_11]: We awarded to a member in the community who for the current school year has embodied what it means to go above and beyond for our students and families.

387
00:42:22,917 --> 00:42:24,898
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just wanted to read a little.

388
00:42:27,919 --> 00:42:30,460
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't believe you need me to move closer to the microphone, but I will.

389
00:42:32,054 --> 00:42:46,701
[SPEAKER_11]: As parents of a child with intellectual and developmental disabilities, it's always in our vision for our kids to eventually have meaningful employment, which provides them with confidence, a continued place in the community, all while teaching them skills that they can use in their everyday lives.

390
00:42:47,722 --> 00:42:54,485
[SPEAKER_11]: It can be a struggle to make that happen or to even sometimes conceive what steps are needed to ensure that our kids get this experience.

391
00:42:55,746 --> 00:42:59,408
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're grateful for parents who are so brave and who take the necessary steps

392
00:42:59,963 --> 00:43:03,564
[SPEAKER_11]: to secure this for not only their children, but for other young adults as well.

393
00:43:04,904 --> 00:43:14,746
[SPEAKER_11]: This is what Carol Nigro, with the help of many, including Michael Nigro, Heather McKinnon, Denise Desjardins, and of course Kelsey, and many others, has brought to life.

394
00:43:15,566 --> 00:43:23,528
[SPEAKER_11]: What was once just a vision for her daughter is now an astounding reality at the Charlotte and William Bloomberg Medford Public Library with Chapters Coffee Cart.

395
00:43:24,128 --> 00:43:26,368
[SPEAKER_11]: We urge you all to visit and frequent this business.

396
00:43:27,009 --> 00:43:29,209
[SPEAKER_11]: And we would like to present, let me bring Carol up here,

397
00:43:39,707 --> 00:43:44,892
[SPEAKER_11]: And we would like to present Carol the CPAC award this year for believing that she could, so she did.

398
00:43:45,072 --> 00:43:45,332
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

399
00:43:53,739 --> 00:43:56,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we get a picture with the school committee and Carol and CPAC?

400
00:43:56,862 --> 00:43:57,703
[SPEAKER_05]: Would that be okay, Mayor?

401
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:58,460
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

402
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:01,943
[SPEAKER_15]: And Carol, can you give chapters a plug?

403
00:44:02,063 --> 00:44:03,524
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that's a long time coming.

404
00:44:03,584 --> 00:44:06,746
[SPEAKER_15]: You've worked with the city, you've worked with CPAC, a number of us.

405
00:44:07,567 --> 00:44:13,972
[SPEAKER_15]: You had a vision a long time ago and you even had to go through the procurement process with the city and you did it.

406
00:44:14,092 --> 00:44:17,434
[SPEAKER_15]: And now you have our children up at the second floor in the library.

407
00:44:17,474 --> 00:44:22,838
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you want to give it a plug, let us know where your hours are and make sure everybody stops by and grabs a cup of coffee.

408
00:44:23,999 --> 00:44:27,542
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, first of all, we're thrilled and honored

409
00:44:27,901 --> 00:44:52,141
[SPEAKER_14]: to be able to set up our first cart in Medford, and to be able to carry out our vision that inclusion works, and to share our model with other communities, to have them look at us in the Medford Public Library, and we hope that it will be a chain reaction into other cities.

410
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:56,813
[SPEAKER_14]: We're currently open Monday through Saturday, 9 to 3.

411
00:44:58,035 --> 00:45:02,078
[SPEAKER_14]: And the rumor is that the coffee is really good.

412
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:04,580
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what we heard.

413
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:05,741
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. Coffee Roasters.

414
00:45:06,382 --> 00:45:07,043
[SPEAKER_14]: So come in.

415
00:45:07,203 --> 00:45:09,665
[SPEAKER_14]: Today was definitely an iced coffee day.

416
00:45:10,626 --> 00:45:11,907
[SPEAKER_14]: And we'll have it ready for you.

417
00:45:12,307 --> 00:45:12,568
[SPEAKER_14]: Wonderful.

418
00:45:12,588 --> 00:45:13,088
[SPEAKER_14]: So come see us.

419
00:45:13,468 --> 00:45:13,869
[SPEAKER_15]: Great job.

420
00:45:20,427 --> 00:45:24,463
[SPEAKER_15]: If the committee wants to come up and CPAC and Carol, your husband.

421
00:45:24,603 --> 00:45:24,684
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep.

422
00:46:25,266 --> 00:46:26,947
[SPEAKER_09]: And Tanya leave.

423
00:46:27,527 --> 00:46:34,132
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to say a little thank you give you a little thank you for all your hard work as our co chairs for the last few years.

424
00:46:35,413 --> 00:46:36,214
[SPEAKER_09]: I know you're shy.

425
00:46:37,975 --> 00:46:40,037
[SPEAKER_09]: They give up so much of their free time.

426
00:46:40,838 --> 00:46:46,282
[SPEAKER_09]: We meet on a monthly basis I'm sure they look forward to eight o'clock on a Friday morning with Joan Bowen.

427
00:46:47,123 --> 00:46:52,404
[SPEAKER_09]: But we meet, we collaborate, we work for the students with disabilities in our community.

428
00:46:52,544 --> 00:46:57,245
[SPEAKER_09]: And I wouldn't want to work with any other parents.

429
00:46:57,285 --> 00:46:58,226
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys are the best.

430
00:46:58,426 --> 00:46:59,886
[SPEAKER_09]: You are so collaborative.

431
00:47:00,046 --> 00:47:06,748
[SPEAKER_17]: And I just wanted to say thank you from all the students.

432
00:47:08,288 --> 00:47:08,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

433
00:47:08,828 --> 00:47:09,168
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

434
00:47:15,913 --> 00:47:16,774
[SPEAKER_15]: Great presentation.

435
00:47:18,735 --> 00:47:25,720
[SPEAKER_15]: We have approval of the 2022-2023 district calendar, Dr. Maurice-Edouard-Vincent, Superintendent.

436
00:47:27,422 --> 00:47:30,864
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion for approval by Member Mustone, seconded by- Second.

437
00:47:31,204 --> 00:47:34,447
[SPEAKER_15]: Member McLaughlin, I'm sure it'll be up on our website right after approval.

438
00:47:34,847 --> 00:47:35,828
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

439
00:47:36,168 --> 00:47:38,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayor, can I just ask a couple quick questions?

440
00:47:41,070 --> 00:47:44,359
[SPEAKER_04]: On the calendar, the dates in June 13, 14, 15, and 16, say noon dismissal, 6 to 12.

441
00:47:49,210 --> 00:47:51,471
[SPEAKER_20]: Linda's missing for secondary schools.

442
00:47:51,892 --> 00:47:57,515
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, so the secondary schools are on a slightly different schedule than K five.

443
00:47:58,256 --> 00:48:02,458
[SPEAKER_20]: So, for elementary schools they would have a regular school day.

444
00:48:02,478 --> 00:48:05,500
[SPEAKER_20]: The last day of school would be at this point.

445
00:48:06,581 --> 00:48:14,406
[SPEAKER_20]: If we have no snow days Friday, June 16, the first day this year Wednesday, August 31, so those three half days.

446
00:48:17,968 --> 00:48:20,151
[SPEAKER_20]: Dr. Cushing, one clarifying question.

447
00:48:20,611 --> 00:48:38,750
[SPEAKER_20]: On the 16th for secondary, on Friday, June 16th, 1130 dismissal for middle school, noon dismissal for elementary and high school.

448
00:48:39,410 --> 00:48:39,751
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

449
00:48:41,112 --> 00:48:51,700
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so my question is or my request is that at the bottom that the green be listed as tentative dates because those dates will move if there are snow days.

450
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:52,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that correct?

451
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:53,181
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.

452
00:48:53,201 --> 00:48:53,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

453
00:48:53,341 --> 00:48:53,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.

454
00:48:54,061 --> 00:49:04,488
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're like me and you put all this stuff on your calendar last year when this came out, it just comes as a surprise to you this week that Thursday is in fact not a half day because the dates have shifted.

455
00:49:04,909 --> 00:49:07,571
[SPEAKER_04]: So, if it can just be noted as tentative,

456
00:49:08,391 --> 00:49:13,612
[SPEAKER_04]: so that people understand that there's, like, don't write this down and forget that you wrote it down.

457
00:49:13,632 --> 00:49:15,612
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that would be helpful.

458
00:49:16,873 --> 00:49:24,334
[SPEAKER_04]: And then my other question was whether the dates in yellow were all grades.

459
00:49:25,154 --> 00:49:34,916
[SPEAKER_20]: So the dates in yellow are noon dismissals, and we will not be having the early release for

460
00:49:37,498 --> 00:49:43,580
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, it's to be determined so it's still under negotiations, but the yellow dates.

461
00:49:44,661 --> 00:49:59,126
[SPEAKER_20]: At this point in time would be for all grades, and then we are working on that early release day of Wednesdays, where we part of our proposal was for that not to exist anymore.

462
00:49:59,786 --> 00:50:04,588
[SPEAKER_20]: So we're still negotiating that but this was the.

463
00:50:07,709 --> 00:50:12,270
[SPEAKER_20]: in order to have additional professional development with staff.

464
00:50:20,492 --> 00:50:21,733
[SPEAKER_15]: It's yet to be determined.

465
00:50:22,633 --> 00:50:23,653
[SPEAKER_15]: That's why it's not specified.

466
00:50:23,733 --> 00:50:24,013
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

467
00:50:24,053 --> 00:50:34,796
[SPEAKER_20]: So we'll definitely add a notation, maybe put an asterisk or something on that last week saying that these attentive dates, you know,

468
00:50:35,916 --> 00:50:41,420
[SPEAKER_20]: hoping that there are no snow days or inclement weather days that would require us.

469
00:50:42,101 --> 00:50:46,764
[SPEAKER_20]: So this is not set in stone.

470
00:50:46,804 --> 00:50:50,867
[SPEAKER_20]: 180 days is our obligation to be in school for students.

471
00:50:51,547 --> 00:51:00,073
[SPEAKER_20]: So according to this calendar right now, June 16th is day 180 for our general education population.

472
00:51:04,396 --> 00:51:12,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so can we also make a note that the the noon dismissals in yellow just put something like tentative or pending.

473
00:51:13,565 --> 00:51:16,869
[SPEAKER_04]: I know there's a lot still going on with this discussion.

474
00:51:18,110 --> 00:51:21,493
[SPEAKER_04]: If we're going to put out a calendar, we're going to create questions if we can't be clear.

475
00:51:21,594 --> 00:51:23,736
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we just need to be able to tell people what is

476
00:51:24,481 --> 00:51:25,581
[SPEAKER_04]: tentative or pending.

477
00:51:25,601 --> 00:51:32,783
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I do think we need to commit to like resolving this particular issue as quickly as possible.

478
00:51:32,863 --> 00:51:38,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Because while high school students can go home by themselves, if we're going to impact kindergartners, they can't.

479
00:51:38,905 --> 00:51:39,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

480
00:51:39,605 --> 00:51:42,226
[SPEAKER_04]: And we need to make sure that parents have adequate time to plan.

481
00:51:42,246 --> 00:51:44,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you.

482
00:51:44,606 --> 00:51:46,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Member Graham, Member McLaughlin.

483
00:51:47,233 --> 00:51:55,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, thank you, I just wanted to say thanks for all the hard work that went into this whoever put this together did a nice job and also I think it's been addressed through.

484
00:51:55,078 --> 00:52:08,506
[SPEAKER_05]: The Chair and Member Graham, but just to clarify that the the early release days and what have you are still in negotiation and those need to be marked as tentative until they're finalized in negotiation.

485
00:52:09,409 --> 00:52:09,809
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, okay.

486
00:52:09,829 --> 00:52:10,129
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

487
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:13,651
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Ruseau, unless you want to yield.

488
00:52:13,751 --> 00:52:23,254
[SPEAKER_19]: I just want to quickly, can we have the back page updated to reflect the policy that we actually have on our website on the MASC page?

489
00:52:23,314 --> 00:52:32,138
[SPEAKER_19]: There are several things, several items in here, which are not marked as no school days, but in fact are no school days on the policy, on the policy manual online.

490
00:52:33,467 --> 00:52:38,411
[SPEAKER_19]: I went through each of them and thankfully none of them impact, none of them are occurring on a school day.

491
00:52:38,531 --> 00:52:43,135
[SPEAKER_19]: So, you know, Eid al-Adha is a no school day.

492
00:52:45,056 --> 00:52:45,917
[SPEAKER_19]: They're all on the website.

493
00:52:45,977 --> 00:52:48,199
[SPEAKER_19]: Just use the list on the website, which is correct.

494
00:52:49,039 --> 00:52:52,922
[SPEAKER_19]: There are three no school days that we approved.

495
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:54,704
[SPEAKER_19]: They are all on weekends.

496
00:52:55,024 --> 00:53:00,828
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's not gonna affect us, but I want this back page to reflect the actual policy of the school committee.

497
00:53:03,533 --> 00:53:07,615
[SPEAKER_19]: Right, yeah, we have these little ends for no school days and how we'll play it forward.

498
00:53:07,695 --> 00:53:12,797
[SPEAKER_19]: But three items on here do not say they're no school days when they in fact are no school days.

499
00:53:13,258 --> 00:53:15,559
[SPEAKER_19]: It just happened to land on weekends or in July.

500
00:53:15,679 --> 00:53:23,903
[SPEAKER_19]: So I just don't want, I've seen this one circulated a few times in this quarter as we've tried to work this out.

501
00:53:24,483 --> 00:53:26,104
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm like, that's not the right one.

502
00:53:26,124 --> 00:53:27,705
[SPEAKER_19]: The right one's on the website.

503
00:53:27,885 --> 00:53:28,945
[SPEAKER_19]: So thank you.

504
00:53:29,405 --> 00:53:29,706
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

505
00:53:29,726 --> 00:53:32,747
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address for the record.

506
00:53:33,254 --> 00:53:36,696
[SPEAKER_24]: Hi, Joanne McKay, 35 Court Street, Metro Mass Roberts School.

507
00:53:38,237 --> 00:53:41,319
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm here tonight to discuss our concerns with the calendar.

508
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:45,422
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Member Graham, for addressing that because that's what we're here for.

509
00:53:46,022 --> 00:53:54,228
[SPEAKER_24]: So Mr. Murphy shared the calendar with the union prior to tonight's meeting, and we did find some errors on the calendar that we pointed out that seemed to have been fixed.

510
00:53:55,148 --> 00:53:58,871
[SPEAKER_24]: However, the one issue that we are a little unhappy about

511
00:53:59,671 --> 00:54:02,052
[SPEAKER_24]: is the concern about the Wednesday early release.

512
00:54:02,813 --> 00:54:12,738
[SPEAKER_24]: As part of negotiations with administration, administration has asked that Wednesday's early release be changed to a full day and we are in discussions with that.

513
00:54:12,778 --> 00:54:14,299
[SPEAKER_24]: We realize the importance of it.

514
00:54:14,819 --> 00:54:20,723
[SPEAKER_24]: The teachers understand that a full day is something that is very important and we are working

515
00:54:21,343 --> 00:54:22,544
[SPEAKER_24]: with administration about this.

516
00:54:22,644 --> 00:54:24,665
[SPEAKER_24]: However, it is not finalized.

517
00:54:25,286 --> 00:54:28,128
[SPEAKER_24]: Our contract is not has not been ratified.

518
00:54:28,528 --> 00:54:30,309
[SPEAKER_24]: We don't have a tentative agreement on it.

519
00:54:30,770 --> 00:54:35,013
[SPEAKER_24]: It's just something that we are in discussions despite the value we see in it.

520
00:54:36,209 --> 00:54:38,030
[SPEAKER_24]: we do not feel it should be on the calendar.

521
00:54:38,070 --> 00:54:40,511
[SPEAKER_24]: Now we pointed this out, the other changes were made.

522
00:54:41,012 --> 00:54:46,315
[SPEAKER_24]: The prior calendar has a little, the yellow symbol said six to 12.

523
00:54:47,175 --> 00:54:51,457
[SPEAKER_24]: It also had a white box that said elementary was early release.

524
00:54:52,118 --> 00:55:05,085
[SPEAKER_24]: And what we're wondering is if someone can speak to the legality of passing a calendar that has changes that have not been agreed upon by a ratified contract, putting a little thing that says to be determined

525
00:55:06,613 --> 00:55:07,614
[SPEAKER_24]: we're going to have to change the calendar.

526
00:55:07,634 --> 00:55:08,856
[SPEAKER_24]: In our opinion is just.

527
00:55:09,456 --> 00:55:10,838
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not satisfactory to us.

528
00:55:10,898 --> 00:55:14,483
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not acceptable because it if it doesn't get ratified by next year.

529
00:55:15,364 --> 00:55:16,545
[SPEAKER_24]: It looks bad on the teachers.

530
00:55:18,628 --> 00:55:19,108
[SPEAKER_24]: Because then the

531
00:55:27,830 --> 00:55:31,072
[SPEAKER_24]: this is something that we are discussing and we find great value in.

532
00:55:31,352 --> 00:55:34,233
[SPEAKER_24]: Unfortunately, it hasn't been ratified right now.

533
00:55:34,433 --> 00:55:39,256
[SPEAKER_24]: So we're asking that it not be put on the calendar that way, because it is misleading to parents.

534
00:55:39,816 --> 00:55:47,300
[SPEAKER_24]: And for parents who do not understand the calendar, new parents, kindergarten parents, preschool parents, they're going to think it's a full day.

535
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:53,884
[SPEAKER_24]: And it's going to be difficult for them for child care if it does not get ratified before the start of the school.

536
00:55:53,944 --> 00:55:56,305
[SPEAKER_24]: So we respectfully ask you not to pass the calendar.

537
00:55:56,874 --> 00:56:01,036
[SPEAKER_24]: that is not specific enough for parents, that is not ratified by our contract.

538
00:56:01,616 --> 00:56:01,936
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

539
00:56:02,316 --> 00:56:02,636
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

540
00:56:03,456 --> 00:56:03,676
[SPEAKER_19]: Mayor.

541
00:56:04,797 --> 00:56:04,937
[SPEAKER_24]: Mayor.

542
00:56:04,957 --> 00:56:05,577
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Russell.

543
00:56:06,117 --> 00:56:06,477
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

544
00:56:06,558 --> 00:56:07,958
[SPEAKER_19]: I certainly understand the concerns.

545
00:56:08,498 --> 00:56:14,700
[SPEAKER_19]: I believe this body is required to pass a calendar and this is our last meeting.

546
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:18,742
[SPEAKER_19]: So if we don't pass a calendar at all, there is no first day of school.

547
00:56:30,792 --> 00:56:31,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Murphy?

548
00:56:39,477 --> 00:56:40,077
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I'm happy.

549
00:56:42,178 --> 00:56:42,738
[SPEAKER_12]: And professional.

550
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:53,224
[SPEAKER_12]: The calendar doesn't specify whether there are early release days on Wednesdays or not, because as was just stated, that issue hasn't been determined yet.

551
00:56:54,245 --> 00:56:56,466
[SPEAKER_12]: If the contract in the school year 22-23

552
00:56:58,533 --> 00:57:09,175
[SPEAKER_12]: has early release days, despite, as we've just heard, the acknowledgement it's not what's best for students, then we will have early release days.

553
00:57:09,875 --> 00:57:14,976
[SPEAKER_12]: If it's not in the contract, then we will have full school days in the interest of students.

554
00:57:15,717 --> 00:57:26,539
[SPEAKER_12]: This calendar, as the union was told at the end of last week, is designed to provide the flexibility that both parties would presumably want

555
00:57:27,608 --> 00:57:29,489
[SPEAKER_12]: pending the outcome of those negotiations.

556
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:37,393
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't say what grade levels are going to have half days, because we don't know what grade levels are going to have half days.

557
00:57:37,553 --> 00:57:48,600
[SPEAKER_12]: Although, frankly, that wouldn't be a matter for the contract if the administration decided that those were half days for students, just like if they decided it was cancel, cancel, cancel days, then that's what would occur.

558
00:57:49,537 --> 00:58:00,946
[SPEAKER_12]: There's nothing misleading about this calendar and the pieces of information that were in the previous calendars are not there because as was stated, it's something that's currently being negotiated.

559
00:58:01,086 --> 00:58:16,058
[SPEAKER_12]: I think what's going to be more confusing is we have, if we have to continually publish new calendars, but what I'm more disheartened by is that when the calendar was provided to the union and the opportunity for questions was raised.

560
00:58:16,806 --> 00:58:20,249
[SPEAKER_12]: the questions that came, all the questions were answered.

561
00:58:20,970 --> 00:58:25,194
[SPEAKER_12]: We weren't told that there would be an attempt to upend the school committee's work this evening.

562
00:58:25,315 --> 00:58:26,456
[SPEAKER_12]: And I find that disappointing.

563
00:58:27,116 --> 00:58:27,477
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

564
00:58:28,718 --> 00:58:29,579
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

565
00:58:37,527 --> 00:58:38,668
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a motion on the floor?

566
00:58:42,928 --> 00:58:45,369
[SPEAKER_24]: Hi, we're not trying to upend anything.

567
00:58:45,469 --> 00:58:53,151
[SPEAKER_24]: We saw the calendar prior to coming here and we looked at it and we said, oh, that change wasn't reflected.

568
00:58:53,951 --> 00:59:01,573
[SPEAKER_24]: And then we came, we were actually in a meeting and then we came and said, let's speak to it so that we could have clarification.

569
00:59:01,954 --> 00:59:03,335
[SPEAKER_24]: We're not trying to cause a problem.

570
00:59:03,355 --> 00:59:08,099
[SPEAKER_24]: We're trying to stop a problem because we know how hard childcare is.

571
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:13,244
[SPEAKER_24]: You see all over Medford Moms, how hard childcare is for these parents.

572
00:59:13,664 --> 00:59:14,805
[SPEAKER_24]: And this could be confusing.

573
00:59:14,865 --> 00:59:20,710
[SPEAKER_24]: And if it is not established before the start of the school next year, it's going to be a big problem.

574
00:59:21,551 --> 00:59:22,272
[SPEAKER_24]: That's why we're here.

575
00:59:22,312 --> 00:59:23,633
[SPEAKER_24]: We're not here to upend anything.

576
00:59:23,673 --> 00:59:25,234
[SPEAKER_24]: I just want to let that be known.

577
00:59:25,855 --> 00:59:26,215
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

578
00:59:28,517 --> 00:59:29,018
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Ruseau.

579
00:59:29,643 --> 00:59:32,605
[SPEAKER_19]: We have somebody who wishes to speak online, I believe.

580
00:59:37,789 --> 00:59:38,669
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, Charlene.

581
00:59:39,310 --> 00:59:41,131
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, can you all hear me?

582
00:59:43,633 --> 00:59:44,393
[SPEAKER_21]: Can everyone hear me?

583
00:59:44,433 --> 00:59:45,074
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not sure.

584
00:59:46,535 --> 00:59:47,075
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, we can.

585
00:59:47,095 --> 00:59:49,076
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, thank you so much, Mayor.

586
00:59:49,316 --> 00:59:52,939
[SPEAKER_21]: Charlene Douglas, president of the Method Teacher Association.

587
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:57,582
[SPEAKER_21]: So I just want to be very clear.

588
00:59:58,628 --> 01:00:02,450
[SPEAKER_21]: here that we are in the midst of negotiations.

589
01:00:02,970 --> 01:00:05,651
[SPEAKER_21]: We do not have an issue with the Wednesdays.

590
01:00:06,432 --> 01:00:11,614
[SPEAKER_21]: And one of the things we work diligently on is talking about this, but we don't have a settled contract.

591
01:00:12,635 --> 01:00:21,499
[SPEAKER_21]: We put this out, what are the legal ramifications to this calendar and to the district?

592
01:00:21,999 --> 01:00:25,741
[SPEAKER_21]: What we're asking you to do is just to stay as of right now,

593
01:00:27,421 --> 01:00:31,665
[SPEAKER_21]: We, you know, tentative, you know, parents, are they going to really understand that?

594
01:00:32,365 --> 01:00:38,190
[SPEAKER_21]: Just put out the calendar as to what it is for now, but that we're still under the present contract.

595
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:44,235
[SPEAKER_21]: And our present contract states that it is a one 30 dismissal for elementary students.

596
01:00:45,356 --> 01:00:51,761
[SPEAKER_21]: So I am very unclear as to what, you know, that, that issue is because it is.

597
01:00:52,962 --> 01:00:56,165
[SPEAKER_21]: And I, my understanding is

598
01:00:57,489 --> 01:01:00,650
[SPEAKER_21]: do we, we can't put something out there that hasn't been ratified.

599
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:19,338
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think we're even looking here and I'm sorry, I don't have my MTA rep on here, but something that's not negotiated, something that hasn't been ratified by the members, I believe, you know, and there's a pretense of the understanding that, oh yeah, this is going to go through, but we don't have any of that.

600
01:01:19,838 --> 01:01:20,138
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

601
01:01:20,338 --> 01:01:22,859
[SPEAKER_21]: Are we looking at an unfair labor practice?

602
01:01:22,939 --> 01:01:23,899
[SPEAKER_21]: What are we looking at here?

603
01:01:23,979 --> 01:01:25,380
[SPEAKER_21]: And I don't even want to use that term,

604
01:01:25,865 --> 01:01:31,750
[SPEAKER_21]: But I know that my membership would be very upset when they see that and parents are going to be confused.

605
01:01:32,270 --> 01:01:42,379
[SPEAKER_21]: I think for the best interest of the students, for childcare, for parents, is that we make sure they understand what this calendar really truly represents.

606
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:44,361
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

607
01:01:45,001 --> 01:01:46,442
[SPEAKER_21]: Any questions, I'll gladly answer.

608
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:49,465
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

609
01:01:55,475 --> 01:01:57,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayor.

610
01:01:58,858 --> 01:02:09,548
[SPEAKER_04]: In past calendars, at least I think this is true, there were start and end times somewhere present on the physical calendar.

611
01:02:09,648 --> 01:02:15,373
[SPEAKER_04]: So elementary starts at whatever the time is, middle school starts at whatever the time is.

612
01:02:16,114 --> 01:02:20,838
[SPEAKER_04]: One solution that I think would be the most clear for parents who are not

613
01:02:21,518 --> 01:02:30,366
[SPEAKER_04]: in the thick of union negotiations is to post school end times with a Wednesday end time of TBD.

614
01:02:30,867 --> 01:02:46,260
[SPEAKER_04]: So that it's clear that on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday, elementary school students are going to get out at 235 and that they need to seek additional information from us at some point in time about the end time for Wednesdays.

615
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:47,301
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that

616
01:02:47,765 --> 01:02:50,946
[SPEAKER_04]: sufficiently tells people that this is a work in progress.

617
01:02:52,126 --> 01:02:55,467
[SPEAKER_04]: But ultimately, you know, we do have to do that.

618
01:02:55,507 --> 01:03:12,790
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other thing I want to point out is that the school committee did pass a policy that this calendar would be issued in November so that people could plan and obviously negotiation years sort of exacerbate these kinds of things that are otherwise simple to accomplish year after year.

619
01:03:12,930 --> 01:03:17,431
[SPEAKER_04]: But hopefully we can get on a better schedule for the next school year.

620
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:19,661
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Member Graham.

621
01:03:19,701 --> 01:03:20,862
[SPEAKER_15]: So is that a motion?

622
01:03:20,982 --> 01:03:26,767
[SPEAKER_15]: We've already passed it, so is that a motion to adjust the language on the front cover for now?

623
01:03:27,068 --> 01:03:35,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, motion to add school start and end times to the official calendar and notes that Wednesdays are TBD for elementary.

624
01:03:35,756 --> 01:03:36,156
[SPEAKER_15]: Second.

625
01:03:36,857 --> 01:03:40,160
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion for approval by Member Graham, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

626
01:03:40,180 --> 01:03:40,900
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

627
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:41,681
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

628
01:03:41,821 --> 01:03:42,542
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

629
01:03:42,842 --> 01:03:43,483
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

630
01:03:44,508 --> 01:03:52,050
[SPEAKER_15]: update on Medford Public Schools security protocol, Dr. Maurice-Edouard-Vincent, Superintendent, and Dr. Peter Cushing, Assistant Superintendent.

631
01:03:59,131 --> 01:04:00,611
[SPEAKER_20]: So good evening.

632
01:04:01,672 --> 01:04:08,633
[SPEAKER_20]: This presentation was also in response to a request, community request, to just

633
01:04:10,026 --> 01:04:22,391
[SPEAKER_20]: Let us share some of the key, key pieces that we are allowed to share to say what Medford Public Schools is doing in support of our safety and security measures.

634
01:04:40,580 --> 01:04:45,344
[SPEAKER_16]: make you aware that the planning and training that we're talking about are critical.

635
01:04:45,964 --> 01:04:57,393
[SPEAKER_16]: Metro Public Schools engages with about 5,000 plus individuals on a daily basis, including all of our students, staff, people who approach our schools in our close-knit urban community.

636
01:04:58,154 --> 01:05:01,937
[SPEAKER_16]: And that requires a certain degree of preparedness.

637
01:05:03,197 --> 01:05:04,217
[SPEAKER_16]: to make sure that we're ready.

638
01:05:04,457 --> 01:05:23,822
[SPEAKER_16]: The plans that we're going to speak about today are largely confidential as they represent the safety and security planning that is essentially our playbook and any compromise of that would be a compromise of the safety and security of our faculty and students and all other members of our community.

639
01:05:24,642 --> 01:05:31,284
[SPEAKER_16]: Regardless of that, what I do want to say is that we have an approach

640
01:05:31,966 --> 01:05:35,189
[SPEAKER_16]: to really look at prevention, planning, and preparedness.

641
01:05:36,330 --> 01:05:55,105
[SPEAKER_16]: So starting with the classroom, the ability for classroom educators, the ability for classroom paraprofessionals, for anyone on the staff to build relationships and connect with our students so that they know a student and they know when something might be a little bit different or something might be a little bit off, that then we can have

642
01:05:56,043 --> 01:05:59,686
[SPEAKER_16]: and interaction with them that may be above and beyond.

643
01:05:59,826 --> 01:06:14,638
[SPEAKER_16]: But social emotional learning in the classroom is really about having students achieve personal and collective goals with their peers, feel and show empathy for others, and establish and maintain supportive relationships while making those responsible decisions.

644
01:06:15,299 --> 01:06:20,503
[SPEAKER_16]: So we've seen the castle wheel numerous times throughout this year for social emotional learning in the classroom.

645
01:06:21,213 --> 01:06:29,316
[SPEAKER_16]: Today, I'm not going to talk so much about the wheel as I'm going to talk about those rings around it, that classroom, those schools, families, caregivers, and communities.

646
01:06:30,316 --> 01:06:43,280
[SPEAKER_16]: So really, classrooms built on SEL offer an ecosystem for that prevention aspect, for us to be building relationships with students.

647
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:50,682
[SPEAKER_16]: And that type of prevention and preparedness is the best type of response for any type of incident.

648
01:06:51,232 --> 01:06:55,138
[SPEAKER_16]: Our coaches and club advisors are also critical to supporting above and beyond.

649
01:06:56,561 --> 01:06:58,304
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's just the first aspect.

650
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:04,724
[SPEAKER_16]: We have a robust counseling and behavioral health services program.

651
01:07:05,585 --> 01:07:26,541
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, we have, um, clinical social workers, your traditional school guidance Councilors, uh, BCBAs school psychologists who work in concert and support with, uh, our school nurse nurses and school leaders, school leaders being members of the central leadership team, school principals, school assistant principals.

652
01:07:27,316 --> 01:07:29,837
[SPEAKER_16]: Those relationships are more than just discipline.

653
01:07:30,077 --> 01:07:37,318
[SPEAKER_16]: It's about educators in the leadership ranks, making those important connections with students.

654
01:07:37,698 --> 01:07:49,741
[SPEAKER_16]: So once again, they're aware when a student may be acting differently, may need extra support, may need help, or that there may be a trigger for something.

655
01:07:49,841 --> 01:07:53,722
[SPEAKER_16]: Counseling team provides this interconnected web of support for students.

656
01:07:54,455 --> 01:08:01,240
[SPEAKER_16]: And we believe that students should be known by a member of the counseling team so that there's an interaction connection.

657
01:08:01,380 --> 01:08:02,280
[SPEAKER_16]: Adjustment Councilors.

658
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:03,781
[SPEAKER_16]: What is an adjustment Councilor?

659
01:08:03,861 --> 01:08:07,183
[SPEAKER_16]: An adjustment Councilor is a clinically trained social worker.

660
01:08:07,223 --> 01:08:17,090
[SPEAKER_16]: This might be an LICSW, an LCSW, an LMHC, or any other number of people who have received clinical training to really support our students.

661
01:08:17,708 --> 01:08:25,453
[SPEAKER_16]: We are currently working towards the one to 250 ratio that was mentioned by Mr. Anderson last week in his public comment.

662
01:08:26,094 --> 01:08:34,160
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, right now, uh, I believe that we are really striving towards that at the Brooks, the McGlynn elementary and the Roberts as well.

663
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:36,961
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, and we are close on those.

664
01:08:37,002 --> 01:08:41,064
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't have the exact ratios here with me today, but we are close on those.

665
01:08:41,805 --> 01:08:46,168
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, adjustment and Councilors also provide a level of intervention to support students.

666
01:08:46,744 --> 01:08:50,346
[SPEAKER_16]: And so communication with families when incidents occur.

667
01:08:50,566 --> 01:09:01,973
[SPEAKER_16]: And interestingly enough, one of the things that we will be working on this summer in conjunction now with the rules, policy and equity subcommittee is reviewing and revising as necessary, the insert recording framework.

668
01:09:01,993 --> 01:09:05,395
[SPEAKER_16]: So parents and caregivers are aware and can partner with the schools.

669
01:09:08,757 --> 01:09:11,079
[SPEAKER_16]: And it was printed before press time.

670
01:09:12,380 --> 01:09:18,296
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, so, uh, just wanted to make you aware of that, um, that that was on our slate to really do this year.

671
01:09:19,836 --> 01:09:20,496
[SPEAKER_16]: Threat assessment.

672
01:09:20,896 --> 01:09:25,478
[SPEAKER_16]: So I will not give you an open session, the exact program that we use.

673
01:09:25,918 --> 01:09:33,359
[SPEAKER_16]: It is a very scripted and form-driven and procedural threat assessment process.

674
01:09:33,859 --> 01:09:44,262
[SPEAKER_16]: I received training in it pre-pandemic, which while that was only in November of 2019, it feels like it may have been in 1970 because of just all the events of the past few years.

675
01:09:45,618 --> 01:09:52,903
[SPEAKER_16]: So this is an approach to institute violence prevention through problem solving with students.

676
01:09:53,343 --> 01:09:57,266
[SPEAKER_16]: It involves assessment and intervention with students who have threatened violence in some manner.

677
01:09:58,207 --> 01:10:13,739
[SPEAKER_16]: This is a standardized process that has been deployed across the district and we'll be working with the appropriate staff this year to provide a refresher that once again was delayed by the events of the pandemic and all the other things that had to be done, but this will be provided

678
01:10:14,219 --> 01:10:16,621
[SPEAKER_16]: this year as we re-enter the school year.

679
01:10:18,802 --> 01:10:21,483
[SPEAKER_16]: So some more specific threat guidelines.

680
01:10:22,024 --> 01:10:25,966
[SPEAKER_16]: These are embargoed as part of our hazard safety and security plans.

681
01:10:26,967 --> 01:10:37,573
[SPEAKER_16]: The threat assessment includes the following identification by concerned members of the community, evaluation by the trained team, and then intervention by the trained team or outside providers

682
01:10:38,283 --> 01:10:39,964
[SPEAKER_16]: in support of the school and the child.

683
01:10:40,024 --> 01:10:44,468
[SPEAKER_16]: This is really about getting the child as much help as possible, as much support as possible.

684
01:10:45,648 --> 01:10:50,392
[SPEAKER_16]: And while some people may at times think, oh my God, a threat assessment, is that an overreaction?

685
01:10:51,192 --> 01:10:57,257
[SPEAKER_16]: I would argue that we no longer live in a world where threats are ever greeted with an overreaction.

686
01:10:58,237 --> 01:11:07,124
[SPEAKER_16]: Given situations that we've seen in our country, our school and partnering personnel need to respond appropriately

687
01:11:07,557 --> 01:11:12,719
[SPEAKER_16]: in each individual situation to make sure that safety for all of our community members is really there.

688
01:11:13,159 --> 01:11:20,502
[SPEAKER_16]: And then again, going back to that incident reporting, that there's family caregiver follow-up so that they're on board.

689
01:11:21,443 --> 01:11:29,266
[SPEAKER_16]: And if they may not necessarily be on board, that we're working with them to come to a place of collaboration and hopefully agreement.

690
01:11:31,977 --> 01:11:33,938
[SPEAKER_16]: So hazard safety and security planning.

691
01:11:34,679 --> 01:11:45,384
[SPEAKER_16]: This is really what you would think about the actionable steps to train faculty and staff to respond once an incident or situation has occurred.

692
01:11:46,525 --> 01:12:00,653
[SPEAKER_16]: This is when everything else we have done for preparedness and prevention may have not necessarily been successful and realize that there will be certain things that we simply cannot plan for.

693
01:12:02,383 --> 01:12:07,525
[SPEAKER_16]: and to respond similarly across different buildings and situations.

694
01:12:08,786 --> 01:12:28,553
[SPEAKER_16]: So right now, actually working with the Mayor's Chief of Staff to form the Municipal Safety Council to bring those people together for the benefit of the Medford Public Schools, and are also working to form our first Medford Public Schools Leadership Safety Council, at least before pre-pandemic times.

695
01:12:32,959 --> 01:12:54,548
[SPEAKER_20]: In addition to the Municipal Safety Council and the Medford Public Schools Leadership Safety Council, we also have a universal safety committee, which meets monthly, and it has a CPAC representative, our Director of Pupil Services attends those meetings, a school committee representative,

696
01:12:55,748 --> 01:12:58,330
[SPEAKER_20]: Special education coordinators are part of that.

697
01:12:58,850 --> 01:13:16,581
[SPEAKER_20]: High school principals, middle school principals, and elementary school principals are also part of the safety committee taking into account all of our populations within the school community when emergency situations may arise.

698
01:13:16,601 --> 01:13:20,904
[SPEAKER_20]: Questions?

699
01:13:24,241 --> 01:13:40,812
[SPEAKER_16]: Our next slide, so we're right now working with numerous stakeholders to construct an emergency operations slash immediate response plan that will provide those standardized responses across situations.

700
01:13:42,012 --> 01:13:50,578
[SPEAKER_16]: They will also provide various critical pieces of information for each school as relates to locations, telephone numbers,

701
01:13:51,398 --> 01:13:57,502
[SPEAKER_16]: various things along those lines that are part of your traditional emergency response plan.

702
01:13:57,722 --> 01:14:00,223
[SPEAKER_16]: Please do not think that this is an exhaustive list.

703
01:14:00,983 --> 01:14:04,906
[SPEAKER_16]: It is pretty comprehensive, but it's not an exhaustive list.

704
01:14:05,066 --> 01:14:18,273
[SPEAKER_16]: While we were working on this initially pre-pandemic in February of pre-pandemic time, I think we added about 15 things to an existing protocol that we are going to flesh out

705
01:14:18,777 --> 01:14:19,277
[SPEAKER_16]: and build.

706
01:14:19,377 --> 01:14:27,821
[SPEAKER_16]: We're also going to create an appendix of letters that serve as a guide for school leaders to notify the community.

707
01:14:28,301 --> 01:14:42,488
[SPEAKER_16]: In the last several weeks, if you're a member of our middle schools, parents have received communications, and that's all in an effort to be transparent and to provide as much up-to-date information as necessary.

708
01:14:43,891 --> 01:14:50,853
[SPEAKER_16]: And so for areas for growth, so we're continually examining our protocols and structures for school safety.

709
01:14:51,633 --> 01:15:02,396
[SPEAKER_16]: So a couple of things following two years, it's really about getting back to some staff training, training all staff to be vigilant with door security and to pose these and other questions.

710
01:15:02,957 --> 01:15:03,697
[SPEAKER_16]: So do we leave?

711
01:15:03,737 --> 01:15:04,797
[SPEAKER_16]: Do we shelter in place?

712
01:15:05,117 --> 01:15:06,618
[SPEAKER_16]: What are the alternate means of egress?

713
01:15:07,218 --> 01:15:08,078
[SPEAKER_16]: Are windows an option?

714
01:15:08,278 --> 01:15:10,379
[SPEAKER_16]: These actually all come from a memo from,

715
01:15:12,052 --> 01:15:17,995
[SPEAKER_16]: uh, the state fire marshal on, uh, emergency fire drills and other drills along that line.

716
01:15:18,736 --> 01:15:26,520
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, how do we inform, uh, leaders and others when there is a situation that they may not be aware of within the building?

717
01:15:27,704 --> 01:15:31,067
[SPEAKER_16]: Building walkthroughs with Metro Police and Fire are currently being scheduled.

718
01:15:31,648 --> 01:15:39,535
[SPEAKER_16]: I had a conversation today with Office of the O'Growth, through Office of the O'Growth with the Chief, to provide a comprehensive assessment of our readiness.

719
01:15:40,475 --> 01:15:51,185
[SPEAKER_16]: And finally, review the security infrastructure and cost estimates for enhancements in two specific areas, security cameras and exterior door access.

720
01:16:00,332 --> 01:16:04,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, yes, thank you for this.

721
01:16:04,054 --> 01:16:05,715
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's a lot of information.

722
01:16:05,735 --> 01:16:08,817
[SPEAKER_03]: And we appreciate you putting them all together.

723
01:16:08,837 --> 01:16:11,118
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a few questions.

724
01:16:11,218 --> 01:16:26,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Just I know, obviously, the questions we're getting these days from families and have been getting is based on what we're learning in the moment about what happened in Uvalde and some of the issues that are coming up that they found

725
01:16:27,540 --> 01:16:35,822
[SPEAKER_03]: were problematic, the reasons why the shooter was able to get in, why maybe no one knew that this person was clearly in trouble and needed help.

726
01:16:36,543 --> 01:16:44,545
[SPEAKER_03]: So a couple of questions I have when I look at, you said that 1 to 250 ratio that we're getting close to that.

727
01:16:44,925 --> 01:16:52,747
[SPEAKER_03]: I seem to recall an earlier meeting this year where I thought we were told that we were at that, and I don't know if we're talking about different numbers and different

728
01:16:53,581 --> 01:17:04,668
[SPEAKER_03]: because I know there's adjustment Councilors, there's guidance Councilors, there's all different forms, but I know at some point there was that one to 250 ratio and I thought we were told that we were at that and maybe even a little better than that.

729
01:17:04,688 --> 01:17:12,272
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm curious if that's a different number or why I'm hearing a difference now that I feel like I'm hearing a difference.

730
01:17:12,713 --> 01:17:19,177
[SPEAKER_16]: So we are there at the middle schools and high school and we are definitely working towards that.

731
01:17:19,677 --> 01:17:19,777
[SPEAKER_16]: Um,

732
01:17:21,598 --> 01:17:26,921
[SPEAKER_16]: they're in the budget, and to bring those up to speed.

733
01:17:27,081 --> 01:17:50,892
[SPEAKER_16]: So I can't honestly remember the specifics of the meeting you're referencing at this time, but I do know that we are working towards that, and that if you were to consider, this is specifically for adjustment Councilors, but if you were to consider all counseling staff, I would go out on a limb and say that we are definitely there, but realize I'm on a limb

734
01:17:51,664 --> 01:18:13,593
[SPEAKER_03]: okay and then I'm wondering too so um another thing that they've definitely talked about is um and this would also get to the staffing ratios or how we I honestly don't know how we go about doing this but you know that that a key a key thing to have is to try to make sure that every student has one adult who they are

735
01:18:15,071 --> 01:18:28,616
[SPEAKER_03]: in contact with or who is kind of there watching them in a way or has a relationship with them, that schools try to build that into their structure.

736
01:18:29,097 --> 01:18:40,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Whether it's the teacher, whether it's a Councilor, whether it's a club advisor, are we in any way looking at how we could try to systematically build that in?

737
01:18:40,621 --> 01:18:42,502
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we've got large numbers of kids, but

738
01:18:43,158 --> 01:18:54,032
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that that's something that seems to come up with every one of these school shootings saying that this was a person who was kind of on the fringes and wasn't being watched or was didn't have an adult that was.

739
01:18:55,694 --> 01:19:01,061
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think, in this case, obviously, we've all did it was already out of school, so if that wouldn't change the school setting but.

740
01:19:01,690 --> 01:19:04,511
[SPEAKER_03]: In some cases, for kids who've been in school, it does.

741
01:19:04,852 --> 01:19:26,583
[SPEAKER_16]: I think one of the things that Medford has done over the past 12 months in bringing on board the re-engagement specialists adds an additional layer of support to really focus on those students who may be not traditionally connecting, as well as to make sure that our classroom teachers

742
01:19:27,583 --> 01:19:34,648
[SPEAKER_16]: Unfortunately, students who may not be connecting, generally speaking, don't involve in clubs, activities, sports.

743
01:19:35,889 --> 01:19:45,696
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know teachers who frequently will have conversations with students to get them engaged, try to get them to a club, try to get them to a sport or whatever else it may be.

744
01:19:46,443 --> 01:19:56,005
[SPEAKER_16]: But I think that with what Medford has done with the re-engagement specialists and the hub to also converse about students in need is one way that we can do that.

745
01:19:56,045 --> 01:20:14,109
[SPEAKER_16]: We're also talking about revamping how big advisory groups are at the high school so that we can have smaller groups with more adults involved so that students can have that sense of connection and maintain that connection throughout their four years, at least at the high school.

746
01:20:15,740 --> 01:20:18,101
[SPEAKER_03]: I have some other basic questions, but I think other people.

747
01:20:20,181 --> 01:20:22,782
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll let others go if someone else wanted to ask some questions.

748
01:20:25,082 --> 01:20:28,683
[SPEAKER_15]: Member McLaughlin and then Member Hays can have a floor back.

749
01:20:30,064 --> 01:20:30,704
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you.

750
01:20:31,424 --> 01:20:38,006
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Dr. Cushon for the report and thank you for including an incident process on the report as well.

751
01:20:38,066 --> 01:20:43,307
[SPEAKER_05]: That was nice to see and the synchronicity was good to see.

752
01:20:45,506 --> 01:20:50,569
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a question on the Municipal Safety Council and the MPS Leadership Safety Council.

753
01:20:51,229 --> 01:21:05,317
[SPEAKER_05]: In both of those instances, I was wondering if I might make a friendly suggestion or if it's been considered that there's some sort of community representative there that is, you know, also that we're considering diversity.

754
01:21:05,357 --> 01:21:12,701
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure we're considering diversity in the high school, middle school, and elementary school representatives, and I don't know if that's where

755
01:21:13,137 --> 01:21:15,879
[SPEAKER_05]: you're factoring families in or if you're thinking about students for those.

756
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:21,404
[SPEAKER_05]: So I wanted a little bit of clarification of where community involvement can be engaged in those.

757
01:21:22,104 --> 01:21:27,208
[SPEAKER_16]: So unfortunately, this is not an opportunity for community involvement.

758
01:21:27,368 --> 01:21:28,469
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's embargoed?

759
01:21:29,130 --> 01:21:29,430
[SPEAKER_16]: Say again?

760
01:21:29,650 --> 01:21:30,611
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's embargoed?

761
01:21:31,455 --> 01:21:38,259
[SPEAKER_16]: Because these are the, like, these are the highest level of security plans that the district has.

762
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:43,362
[SPEAKER_16]: And I fully respect the call for community involvement on most things.

763
01:21:44,863 --> 01:21:50,827
[SPEAKER_16]: But I want to make sure that our students, staff, and those who come to our schools on a daily basis

764
01:21:51,351 --> 01:21:52,291
[SPEAKER_16]: are safe and secure.

765
01:21:52,551 --> 01:21:52,811
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

766
01:21:53,091 --> 01:22:08,255
[SPEAKER_16]: And, um, while there are many trusted members of the community, um, who I look to seek, um, their input on various things, I, I don't necessarily, and I'll have, I'll be happy to bring this up with the chief and other members, uh, when it comes.

767
01:22:08,415 --> 01:22:10,896
[SPEAKER_16]: So I don't want you to think it's a, it's a no outright.

768
01:22:11,696 --> 01:22:13,437
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, however, this is, um,

769
01:22:16,971 --> 01:22:25,677
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, in Maslow's hierarchy, you know, in order to reach the fulfillment stage, you gotta make sure that you're safe and you're secure.

770
01:22:26,698 --> 01:22:41,108
[SPEAKER_16]: And I take this to be extraordinarily important work, and I wanna make sure that the other people who will serve on these committees are okay with saying that that's a possibility.

771
01:22:41,428 --> 01:22:44,451
[SPEAKER_05]: I can appreciate that, and I can certainly appreciate that, you know,

772
01:22:45,916 --> 01:22:50,021
[SPEAKER_05]: top secret nature, if you will, of the plans and making sure that that kept that's kept internal.

773
01:22:50,942 --> 01:22:56,990
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess the other thing I would ask is about quarterly meetings with the USC, the Universal Safety Committee.

774
01:22:57,050 --> 01:23:01,916
[SPEAKER_05]: So not necessarily regarding the embargoed material, but more specific to

775
01:23:02,540 --> 01:23:04,721
[SPEAKER_05]: the students with additional needs.

776
01:23:04,801 --> 01:23:18,146
[SPEAKER_05]: So also going down to your next, um, uh, quadrant where you have a number of the different things that would be considered by these, um, by these councils, I would suggest adding slide 12.

777
01:23:18,886 --> 01:23:19,506
[SPEAKER_16]: What would that be?

778
01:23:19,526 --> 01:23:20,067
[SPEAKER_16]: Slide 12.

779
01:23:20,827 --> 01:23:26,109
[SPEAKER_05]: I would suggest adding, uh, students with additional needs, um, here because there's a lot,

780
01:23:26,564 --> 01:23:30,406
[SPEAKER_05]: that the USC has considered, specifically around physical needs?

781
01:23:30,446 --> 01:23:33,768
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have the stretchers that we need if a person's not able to be mobile?

782
01:23:33,808 --> 01:23:34,688
[SPEAKER_05]: How do we get them out?

783
01:23:34,748 --> 01:23:35,508
[SPEAKER_05]: How many are there?

784
01:23:35,969 --> 01:23:37,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Where are the classrooms located?

785
01:23:37,369 --> 01:23:38,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they near the stairs?

786
01:23:38,470 --> 01:23:39,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Those kinds of things.

787
01:23:39,951 --> 01:23:46,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Does law enforcement know where the classrooms that have substantially separate students with additional needs?

788
01:23:47,307 --> 01:23:51,790
[SPEAKER_05]: a substantially separate classroom so that they have access to those, they know where those are.

789
01:23:51,810 --> 01:23:56,533
[SPEAKER_05]: And also the autism training that the law enforcement currently does.

790
01:23:56,553 --> 01:24:07,860
[SPEAKER_05]: So I forget his name, the law enforcement officer who's currently running the autism training for law enforcement, but I would really recommend that that goes underneath the students with additional needs aspect as well.

791
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:16,125
[SPEAKER_05]: As we've been playing out different scenarios in the universal safety committee, one might imagine, for example, you know, a horrible situation in the school

792
01:24:16,590 --> 01:24:17,451
[SPEAKER_05]: something's happening.

793
01:24:17,991 --> 01:24:30,718
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the students is in the bathroom, maybe as a student with, you know, a disability, you know, with a need or whatever, and, and heads towards the law enforcement personnel, because they have an uncle who's a police officer.

794
01:24:31,178 --> 01:24:34,180
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, they're wondering if they might know them or any number of things, right?

795
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:42,405
[SPEAKER_05]: How does one recognize that that could be a student that has some additional needs, doesn't know that like, so we have to think about that in terms of the planning as well.

796
01:24:42,445 --> 01:24:44,246
[SPEAKER_05]: So the USC has done some of that work.

797
01:24:44,758 --> 01:24:56,165
[SPEAKER_05]: But I would highly encourage that those items be added to that specific category with some subcategories be added to the security hazard safety and security planning that you're talking about.

798
01:24:56,205 --> 01:25:04,911
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe quarterly meeting with the USC or members of the USC that you feel are appropriate in terms of the privacy concerns.

799
01:25:05,291 --> 01:25:08,173
[SPEAKER_05]: And then lastly, I guess I would just ask for some sort of professional

800
01:25:09,577 --> 01:25:16,943
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe, I don't know, not development, but some sort of maybe meeting or something like that, that addresses the community.

801
01:25:17,043 --> 01:25:31,854
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe it's an annual event where it's at, you know, the theater or something, but somewhere where the community does feel like they're engaged and involved in this, not necessarily around plans specifically, but around addressing, you know, safety and school concerns.

802
01:25:31,894 --> 01:25:35,116
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, it can include a panel where people are talking or, you know,

803
01:25:35,544 --> 01:25:43,109
[SPEAKER_05]: movie that sort of addresses or some experts or something, but some way in which the community can feel engaged on this on an annual basis.

804
01:25:43,149 --> 01:25:45,751
[SPEAKER_05]: So those are my questions slash comments.

805
01:25:46,171 --> 01:25:47,132
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I'm appreciate it.

806
01:25:47,232 --> 01:25:48,133
[SPEAKER_16]: I appreciate those.

807
01:25:48,153 --> 01:25:52,435
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, happy to bring them to the larger group when we meet.

808
01:25:55,538 --> 01:25:56,698
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Hays, do you have another question?

809
01:25:56,718 --> 01:25:57,599
[SPEAKER_15]: And then Member Ruseau?

810
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:00,961
[SPEAKER_15]: We had somebody online.

811
01:26:01,582 --> 01:26:03,003
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, Member Hays, and then we'll go to

812
01:26:04,048 --> 01:26:23,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was just wondering if at some point we could also just go over, I think, you know, again, parent letters that we've gotten have also been questioning kind of at a more basic level, you know, things like the intercom systems at the doors.

813
01:26:24,182 --> 01:26:28,125
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not necessarily consistently used at every school to let someone in.

814
01:26:28,801 --> 01:26:35,546
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that some schools have a, such as the one I'm at, the Roberts, you know, there is a person sitting at a front desk.

815
01:26:35,586 --> 01:26:46,413
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand that the security cameras, but you know, the question we've gotten is, but by the time you let someone in, you know, that's, that, that doesn't help, you know?

816
01:26:46,473 --> 01:26:53,057
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so if you, if you're not questioning who's coming in and why, you know, that seems like a pretty basic safety thing that could be in place.

817
01:26:54,158 --> 01:26:57,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Questions about, you know, are, do we have a way of ensuring that,

818
01:26:58,973 --> 01:27:02,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Doors that go to the outside once the kids are in in the morning, are they locked?

819
01:27:02,956 --> 01:27:08,320
[SPEAKER_03]: I did notice somebody the other day at the Roberts again, going around and checking doors just to make sure they were locked.

820
01:27:08,620 --> 01:27:14,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Just are there actual protocols in place for ensuring that these things happen?

821
01:27:15,105 --> 01:27:27,255
[SPEAKER_03]: I think some of those for the community, some of those kind of basic things would be as much a sense of security as some of these higher level things that are important too, but just that idea of

822
01:27:27,677 --> 01:27:35,864
[SPEAKER_03]: What are some of the basic things at each school that are in place each day that ensure the kids are safe in their school, you know?

823
01:27:37,005 --> 01:27:39,307
[SPEAKER_16]: And we can make sure that we update you on all of those.

824
01:27:40,088 --> 01:27:54,541
[SPEAKER_16]: But also, you know, want to make sure that you know that we have all communicated with our principals to make sure that they're informing staff, like somebody runs out to the car quick and may want to prop open a door or something along those lines.

825
01:27:55,311 --> 01:27:57,273
[SPEAKER_16]: that that's not acceptable.

826
01:27:57,373 --> 01:28:06,201
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a piece of concrete about that big could disable the best security system in the world if it's propped in the appropriate location.

827
01:28:07,021 --> 01:28:15,028
[SPEAKER_16]: And so the important thing is for all of our staff to remain vigilant, for our parents to remain vigilant.

828
01:28:15,108 --> 01:28:16,689
[SPEAKER_16]: If they see something, say something.

829
01:28:18,011 --> 01:28:20,773
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, to help be part of the solution.

830
01:28:21,962 --> 01:28:26,580
[SPEAKER_16]: And the best way to do that is if somebody does see something to first contact the school principal.

831
01:28:27,821 --> 01:28:37,123
[SPEAKER_16]: The school principal or assistant principal are the best people to go to for immediate action and immediate rectification of anything that someone may see.

832
01:28:38,083 --> 01:28:52,866
[SPEAKER_16]: But we are working also to make sure that all of our staff are trained on the proper entry procedures to access the buildings and for them to state who they are, their purpose for being there, and who they are there to see.

833
01:28:56,408 --> 01:29:00,650
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, we have somebody on Zoom, an Adam that would like to speak.

834
01:29:00,730 --> 01:29:02,110
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address for the record, please.

835
01:29:05,732 --> 01:29:07,953
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, Jessica Haley, Full Off Road.

836
01:29:07,973 --> 01:29:23,039
[SPEAKER_08]: I just have a question or comment about having like police officers every day at each school or like adopting the guardian program that Florida has in place.

837
01:29:23,885 --> 01:29:25,485
[SPEAKER_08]: have we looked into anything like that?

838
01:29:25,505 --> 01:29:36,528
[SPEAKER_08]: Because my son's school, I noticed after the tragedy in Uvalde, there were officers at the school at drop off and pick up, but that lasted for two days.

839
01:29:37,728 --> 01:29:42,869
[SPEAKER_08]: So obviously we thought we needed them there, but for two days and then they're gone.

840
01:29:44,289 --> 01:29:51,811
[SPEAKER_08]: Also with the doors being opened during the day, a year or two ago, someone,

841
01:29:52,625 --> 01:29:54,746
[SPEAKER_08]: did get into my son's school.

842
01:29:55,266 --> 01:30:07,830
[SPEAKER_08]: Thankfully he wasn't armed or anything like that, but when kids were coming in from recess, he did get in and they would have been known there to do anything to protect the kids.

843
01:30:08,590 --> 01:30:15,072
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm just wondering, are we thinking on anything on those lines of protecting our schools in that way?

844
01:30:15,672 --> 01:30:16,032
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

845
01:30:19,105 --> 01:30:24,469
[SPEAKER_16]: So the Medford police and the Medford public schools have a very strong relationship.

846
01:30:25,670 --> 01:30:34,656
[SPEAKER_16]: But there's significant debate around how many officers should be in schools.

847
01:30:35,076 --> 01:30:43,142
[SPEAKER_16]: And while it provides safety and security, and I've had tremendous luck working with all the school resource officers in my career who

848
01:30:43,972 --> 01:30:52,618
[SPEAKER_16]: The seven or eight of them have been nothing short of phenomenal and built real relationships and have been coaches, club advisors, those types of things.

849
01:30:53,538 --> 01:31:10,869
[SPEAKER_16]: I do know that there are also staffing challenges in that area and the ability to provide what would essentially be eight resource officers might be a challenge across all the schools.

850
01:31:11,950 --> 01:31:24,637
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that I want to go back to, and I appreciate your comments, that the most important thing is for all staff to remain vigilant, to make sure that doors are closed, make sure that doors are locked, make sure that first floor windows are closed and locked.

851
01:31:25,517 --> 01:31:31,100
[SPEAKER_16]: Those types of things are extremely critical to the safety and security of our students and staff.

852
01:31:32,961 --> 01:31:33,781
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

853
01:31:36,883 --> 01:31:38,964
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to receive and place on file.

854
01:31:41,325 --> 01:31:46,412
[SPEAKER_15]: by member Stone, seconded by member Hays.

855
01:31:46,492 --> 01:31:47,253
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor.

856
01:31:47,973 --> 01:31:49,395
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you so much, Dr. Cushing.

857
01:31:50,036 --> 01:31:56,985
[SPEAKER_15]: We have an update on implementation of the NWEA map by Dr. Marice Edouard-Vincent, our superintendent.

858
01:32:22,174 --> 01:32:24,376
[SPEAKER_20]: Just waiting a moment for the slide deck to be pulled up.

859
01:32:43,715 --> 01:32:55,939
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'm here this evening to present the update on the implementation of our first full administration of the NWEA map assessment system.

860
01:32:56,519 --> 01:33:00,560
[SPEAKER_20]: NWEA standing for Northwest Evaluation Association.

861
01:33:06,162 --> 01:33:09,683
[SPEAKER_20]: So as I begin my remarks, I wanted to say that

862
01:33:12,170 --> 01:33:31,296
[SPEAKER_20]: Having NWEA math growth assessment right now in Medford Public Schools, that the first purpose of the assessment system is to be a diagnostic tool for us to be able to make data-informed decisions about what's taking place in all of our schools.

863
01:33:32,257 --> 01:33:41,720
[SPEAKER_20]: And so in order to create a data-informed culture, it is important to consider that data is to be used for instructional improvement.

864
01:33:43,717 --> 01:33:51,522
[SPEAKER_20]: This data that will be presented today is based upon growth and it is by nature very, very dynamic.

865
01:33:52,022 --> 01:33:53,763
[SPEAKER_20]: It is not a fixed number.

866
01:33:55,905 --> 01:34:06,231
[SPEAKER_20]: We should also consider and remember that we're thinking about the whole child, that data is not fate for any individual child, classroom or school.

867
01:34:07,271 --> 01:34:12,695
[SPEAKER_20]: Like a map, it is an opportunity to see where we are in relation to where we want to go.

868
01:34:14,474 --> 01:34:20,158
[SPEAKER_20]: So let us tread cautiously upon how we interpret the data that I'm going to share with you this evening.

869
01:34:28,985 --> 01:34:35,049
[SPEAKER_20]: So as we look at this data, I have two protocols that are in front of you.

870
01:34:35,069 --> 01:34:39,793
[SPEAKER_20]: The arrow says that we collect data points

871
01:34:41,837 --> 01:34:46,620
[SPEAKER_20]: We assess and make meaning of the data, and then we adjust our practice.

872
01:34:50,241 --> 01:34:55,324
[SPEAKER_20]: The image on the right shows the data-wise ladder of inference.

873
01:34:56,525 --> 01:35:08,031
[SPEAKER_20]: And so you have data, you interpret the data, you draw conclusions, and the final step is you always take action and we begin the cycle over and over again.

874
01:35:16,943 --> 01:35:20,468
[SPEAKER_20]: Here, the image on the left is an iceberg.

875
01:35:23,092 --> 01:35:26,877
[SPEAKER_20]: An iceberg is something where you can only really see the top of it.

876
01:35:27,935 --> 01:35:34,558
[SPEAKER_20]: So as we're looking at this data, the hard number is the tip of the iceberg that we can actually see.

877
01:35:35,439 --> 01:35:40,201
[SPEAKER_20]: We don't see all of the other components that are beneath the water.

878
01:35:40,221 --> 01:35:45,284
[SPEAKER_20]: And so that's why I said a little earlier that we're talking about the whole child.

879
01:35:46,465 --> 01:35:50,467
[SPEAKER_20]: So again, we're not taking this data point to define a child

880
01:35:52,091 --> 01:36:03,457
[SPEAKER_20]: exclusively by a number, but to be able to say that this is just one point of many points as we work with children and think about the learning of the whole child.

881
01:36:08,319 --> 01:36:15,323
[SPEAKER_20]: So these are a few summary of actions of things that we've been doing working with data analysis.

882
01:36:16,043 --> 01:36:19,165
[SPEAKER_20]: This year, we had professional development,

883
01:36:20,655 --> 01:36:31,420
[SPEAKER_20]: with all of our teachers for NWEA MAP training for them to understand what the test was going to be like and how to use this new tool.

884
01:36:32,901 --> 01:36:37,543
[SPEAKER_20]: Also this year, administrative meetings focused on

885
01:36:38,303 --> 01:36:39,304
[SPEAKER_20]: data analysis.

886
01:36:39,884 --> 01:36:44,086
[SPEAKER_20]: We also use the preliminary baseline data for NWEA map.

887
01:36:44,506 --> 01:36:49,369
[SPEAKER_20]: And this professional development took place with principals, directors, and coordinators.

888
01:36:50,109 --> 01:36:55,312
[SPEAKER_20]: And Dr. Carmen Williams was also part of the body of research that she worked on.

889
01:36:55,432 --> 01:37:00,454
[SPEAKER_20]: But during these professional development meetings, we developed a common language.

890
01:37:00,954 --> 01:37:06,197
[SPEAKER_20]: We talked specifically about data analysis and the importance of triangulation of data.

891
01:37:08,466 --> 01:37:11,283
[SPEAKER_20]: I have inside a document.

892
01:37:12,575 --> 01:37:17,840
[SPEAKER_20]: that was used, Dr. Cushing, are you able to just click on that?

893
01:37:18,240 --> 01:37:19,541
[SPEAKER_20]: Can you go back one, please?

894
01:37:21,003 --> 01:37:38,998
[SPEAKER_20]: Can you click on the example of data analysis conclusions that this happens on some levels within department meetings where the educators are looking at

895
01:37:40,464 --> 01:37:42,006
[SPEAKER_20]: Where are the areas of success?

896
01:37:42,446 --> 01:37:44,428
[SPEAKER_20]: Where are the areas that we need to revisit?

897
01:37:44,968 --> 01:37:57,340
[SPEAKER_20]: And this is just one hard copy of an example of how teachers are looking at data and using their data to inform their instruction and to inform next steps.

898
01:37:57,901 --> 01:37:58,842
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

899
01:37:58,882 --> 01:38:01,905
[SPEAKER_20]: Can you revert back to the slide deck, please?

900
01:38:08,979 --> 01:38:09,679
[SPEAKER_20]: Coherence.

901
01:38:11,060 --> 01:38:20,523
[SPEAKER_20]: So this work with NWEAMAP, we finally have one assessment system that's being used in all of our eight schools.

902
01:38:21,223 --> 01:38:23,083
[SPEAKER_20]: Every building is using the assessment.

903
01:38:23,604 --> 01:38:27,325
[SPEAKER_20]: It's the same exact assessment being used district wide.

904
01:38:27,605 --> 01:38:37,568
[SPEAKER_20]: So we are able to compare data and look at how students are demonstrating growth with the content that is being covered.

905
01:38:44,324 --> 01:38:52,150
[SPEAKER_20]: Again, I talked a little bit about the slide deck, the sheet that we just showed you showed the stoplight activity.

906
01:38:53,051 --> 01:39:04,039
[SPEAKER_20]: These are the types of questions that teachers and principals, administrators, curriculum directors are asking their teachers as they look at data.

907
01:39:04,520 --> 01:39:05,861
[SPEAKER_20]: What do they notice and wonder?

908
01:39:08,191 --> 01:39:12,417
[SPEAKER_20]: the single loop, double loop learning, and stoplight activity.

909
01:39:12,758 --> 01:39:17,885
[SPEAKER_20]: All of these activities, again, are happening at all different levels across the district.

910
01:39:18,987 --> 01:39:19,608
[SPEAKER_20]: Dr. Cushing?

911
01:39:22,272 --> 01:39:23,594
[SPEAKER_20]: The spotlight activity

912
01:39:26,764 --> 01:39:31,290
[SPEAKER_20]: Red, what can we stop doing because we don't have evidence that it is effective?

913
01:39:32,431 --> 01:39:37,698
[SPEAKER_20]: Yellow, what do we need to adjust and or consider an alternative way?

914
01:39:38,258 --> 01:39:42,784
[SPEAKER_20]: And green, what do we need to continue doing because it is working?

915
01:39:45,720 --> 01:39:48,843
[SPEAKER_20]: So as I get ready, Dr. Cushing, thank you.

916
01:39:49,924 --> 01:39:57,010
[SPEAKER_20]: As I get ready to show the hard data for the district, I wanted to just bring up some relevant vocabulary.

917
01:39:57,831 --> 01:40:01,214
[SPEAKER_20]: We're going to be talking about the RIT median score.

918
01:40:03,115 --> 01:40:08,280
[SPEAKER_20]: When you see the words or the letters RIT, it's the rash interval unit scale.

919
01:40:09,525 --> 01:40:12,947
[SPEAKER_20]: It's named after a Danish mathematician, George Lash.

920
01:40:13,827 --> 01:40:25,953
[SPEAKER_20]: The RIT scale is a stable scale, like feet and inches, that accurately measures student performance regardless of age, grades, or grade level.

921
01:40:26,833 --> 01:40:37,658
[SPEAKER_20]: Like marking height on a growth chart and being able to see how tall your child is at various points in time, you can also see how much they have grown between tests.

922
01:40:39,179 --> 01:40:45,023
[SPEAKER_20]: You can use this height analogy when explaining RIT, the RIT process, to students as well.

923
01:40:45,844 --> 01:40:50,107
[SPEAKER_20]: The higher the RIT score, the more achievement the student has in the subject.

924
01:40:51,148 --> 01:41:00,175
[SPEAKER_20]: The student's percentile ranking in conditional growth percentile can show how much the student has achieved in comparison with their peers.

925
01:41:04,017 --> 01:41:04,558
[SPEAKER_20]: Dr. Cushing.

926
01:41:06,072 --> 01:41:09,415
[SPEAKER_20]: There's a few other vocabulary words that I just wanted to highlight.

927
01:41:09,895 --> 01:41:12,437
[SPEAKER_20]: We're going to be sharing the median score today.

928
01:41:12,457 --> 01:41:17,202
[SPEAKER_20]: The median score is the middle number of a data set.

929
01:41:17,822 --> 01:41:21,165
[SPEAKER_20]: It separates the upper half of a data set from the lower half.

930
01:41:22,606 --> 01:41:36,194
[SPEAKER_20]: The mean is the same as the average value of a data set and is found using a calculation by adding up all of the numbers and dividing that number, dividing by the number of numbers in the data set.

931
01:41:37,295 --> 01:41:41,597
[SPEAKER_20]: And the mode is the number in a data set that occurs most frequently.

932
01:41:41,617 --> 01:41:48,301
[SPEAKER_20]: You'll also see CCR, which is talking about college and career readiness.

933
01:41:50,836 --> 01:41:53,778
[SPEAKER_20]: We're going to begin with our science benchmarks.

934
01:41:55,919 --> 01:42:18,333
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm really pleased to report to the committee that this purple band in the middle, which says NWEA median score, it's at the 50th percentile, that the majority of our performance as a district was above the median score listed.

935
01:42:20,618 --> 01:42:26,764
[SPEAKER_20]: which on the left-hand side shows higher achievement, lower achievement, where that little arrow is.

936
01:42:29,346 --> 01:42:32,229
[SPEAKER_20]: So science was given two times this year.

937
01:42:32,249 --> 01:42:40,076
[SPEAKER_20]: We're showing the data for third grade,

938
01:42:42,745 --> 01:42:57,328
[SPEAKER_20]: The median score was 188, and in the winter when our score was given, our range was, our first number ranged from 191 to 199.

939
01:42:59,108 --> 01:43:03,989
[SPEAKER_20]: Dr. Kirshen, you can go forward to, thank you, third, fourth, and fifth grade.

940
01:43:04,889 --> 01:43:08,930
[SPEAKER_20]: So the median score that we were looking for in third grade was 188.

941
01:43:12,361 --> 01:43:18,847
[SPEAKER_20]: At all four elementary schools, the range that was shown, we exceeded that median score.

942
01:43:20,249 --> 01:43:24,213
[SPEAKER_20]: In fourth grade, the median score was 195.

943
01:43:24,253 --> 01:43:29,257
[SPEAKER_20]: In all elementary schools, we exceeded 195, the 50th percentile, we were above that score.

944
01:43:37,910 --> 01:43:49,766
[SPEAKER_20]: In fifth grade, the median score was 200, and our range was from 203 to 208 in the winter administration of the science.

945
01:43:53,743 --> 01:44:03,168
[SPEAKER_20]: At the elementary level, all of our elementary schools were above the non-referenced median score.

946
01:44:03,549 --> 01:44:11,373
[SPEAKER_20]: Again, it's nationally normed, so we are at or above the nationally normed reference.

947
01:44:12,014 --> 01:44:14,235
[SPEAKER_20]: Dr. Cushing, thank you.

948
01:44:14,255 --> 01:44:18,577
[SPEAKER_20]: For grade six, the median score was 204.

949
01:44:21,540 --> 01:44:27,045
[SPEAKER_20]: and our range was between 203, our lowest score, and 206.

950
01:44:28,667 --> 01:44:35,794
[SPEAKER_20]: So the three numbers that are showing shows you the range of scores within the school, 206, 207, 208, 203, 204, 205, but the median score was 204.

951
01:44:35,914 --> 01:44:36,554
[SPEAKER_20]: In grade seven,

952
01:44:47,711 --> 01:44:55,457
[SPEAKER_20]: The median score was 207, and we were above that at 208 and 214.

953
01:44:56,958 --> 01:44:59,660
[SPEAKER_20]: In the eighth grade, the median score was 210.

954
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:07,946
[SPEAKER_20]: We were at 216 and 210, respectively, hitting the median percentile.

955
01:45:10,048 --> 01:45:11,789
[SPEAKER_20]: For high school, Dr. Cushing?

956
01:45:14,076 --> 01:45:20,938
[SPEAKER_20]: The median score was 211 for ninth grade, and we were at 217.

957
01:45:24,239 --> 01:45:31,781
[SPEAKER_20]: In 10th grade, the median score was 213, and we were at 219 as our lowest score.

958
01:45:33,901 --> 01:45:36,082
[SPEAKER_20]: Our summary of science is as follows.

959
01:45:38,154 --> 01:45:52,086
[SPEAKER_20]: that we were able to show growth, and again, this was a diagnostic tool at all levels, and we showed even greater growth between the winter and spring assessments that took place for grades three through eight.

960
01:45:54,542 --> 01:46:08,947
[SPEAKER_20]: There was limited growth at grade six, but this again is the first time when we get to the secondary level that our sixth graders end up having a science, an individualized science teacher.

961
01:46:09,687 --> 01:46:17,790
[SPEAKER_20]: So that was one area where we saw a slight adjustment.

962
01:46:19,991 --> 01:46:22,632
[SPEAKER_20]: Dr. Cushing, we can move forward to math.

963
01:46:24,565 --> 01:46:27,009
[SPEAKER_20]: In math, this is a similar scale.

964
01:46:28,872 --> 01:46:29,653
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, Dr. Cushing.

965
01:46:30,314 --> 01:46:31,816
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, Member Ursula.

966
01:46:32,157 --> 01:46:32,498
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

967
01:46:35,524 --> 01:46:38,925
[SPEAKER_19]: I still don't know what the three numbers on each.

968
01:46:39,806 --> 01:46:45,588
[SPEAKER_20]: So the three numbers are the range of scores that were administered in that.

969
01:46:45,708 --> 01:46:52,230
[SPEAKER_20]: So all the scores fell between, Dr. Cushing, you can leave it right here.

970
01:46:52,751 --> 01:46:55,852
[SPEAKER_20]: So grade 10, the winter range of scores

971
01:46:56,892 --> 01:47:00,095
[SPEAKER_20]: At the high school, we fell between 219 and 221.

972
01:47:00,736 --> 01:47:07,402
[SPEAKER_19]: Are you saying that every student that took the test got 219, 220, or 221?

973
01:47:07,462 --> 01:47:10,765
[SPEAKER_20]: So this was the average.

974
01:47:11,125 --> 01:47:14,789
[SPEAKER_20]: So they broke it out by individualized tests.

975
01:47:15,029 --> 01:47:18,212
[SPEAKER_20]: And then when we pulled a specific report to say

976
01:47:19,713 --> 01:47:22,655
[SPEAKER_20]: 10th grade, which is where I'm meeting right now, what was the range?

977
01:47:23,275 --> 01:47:26,837
[SPEAKER_20]: It was 219 to 221 in the fall, in the winter.

978
01:47:26,857 --> 01:47:31,700
[SPEAKER_20]: And then in the spring, we were 220 to 222.

979
01:47:32,020 --> 01:47:34,882
[SPEAKER_20]: So there was small growth, but there was positive growth.

980
01:47:35,162 --> 01:47:36,583
[SPEAKER_19]: So I understand ranges.

981
01:47:36,823 --> 01:47:47,169
[SPEAKER_19]: I just, I've never seen ranges displayed with three numbers or ranges like your 20 to 30 or your, there's never a middle number in a range as I've ever seen it.

982
01:47:47,670 --> 01:47:48,110
[SPEAKER_19]: So I don't,

983
01:47:49,195 --> 01:47:54,703
[SPEAKER_19]: this middle number, I mean, if you took all those middle numbers out, we would all be on exactly the same page that between 217 and 219 is 218.

984
01:47:54,743 --> 01:47:55,564
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't think I'm fine.

985
01:48:01,107 --> 01:48:03,328
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, thank you.

986
01:48:03,368 --> 01:48:03,969
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening.

987
01:48:04,629 --> 01:48:06,290
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping that everyone can hear me.

988
01:48:06,310 --> 01:48:09,252
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Rocco Siri, I'm the director of science.

989
01:48:09,712 --> 01:48:16,136
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to follow up on Mr. Russo's question about what the range represents.

990
01:48:16,476 --> 01:48:23,100
[SPEAKER_01]: The middle number of the three numbers is the median and the two numbers outside of that is the range.

991
01:48:23,880 --> 01:48:27,382
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that will clarify it for him and for the audience.

992
01:48:28,062 --> 01:48:33,085
[SPEAKER_01]: So the middle number is the median and the two numbers on the outside is the range.

993
01:48:33,165 --> 01:48:36,526
[SPEAKER_01]: Not all scores fall within that, but that's the range.

994
01:48:37,907 --> 01:48:42,449
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a statistical range of the numbers you'll notice.

995
01:48:44,520 --> 01:48:48,981
[SPEAKER_01]: there are about one to two points beyond that score.

996
01:48:49,001 --> 01:49:02,743
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way I explain it to my own children who have taken the test is on a very good day, you may score at the upper range around that median.

997
01:49:03,183 --> 01:49:06,964
[SPEAKER_01]: And on a day where it's a little difficult for you, you might score at the lower end of that.

998
01:49:07,524 --> 01:49:12,505
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the two pieces that perhaps explain

999
01:49:14,346 --> 01:49:21,411
[SPEAKER_01]: why we have three numbers, and hopefully that will clarify it for all the other pieces.

1000
01:49:23,052 --> 01:49:23,392
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1001
01:49:23,412 --> 01:49:24,133
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Ruseau.

1002
01:49:24,273 --> 01:49:24,653
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1003
01:49:24,713 --> 01:49:41,746
[SPEAKER_19]: So I understand the middle number now, but when I'm looking at this, I don't understand what a range is if you're not telling me what is the worst score a kid got and the best score a kid got, because as a school committee member, I don't really know

1004
01:49:42,769 --> 01:49:49,012
[SPEAKER_19]: These ranges that are barely a point above or maybe two points above or below the median, they tell me nothing.

1005
01:49:49,472 --> 01:49:59,656
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, really, unless you're telling me that every kid in the district is performing that close to the median, which I will have to tell you, I really hope nobody tries to tell us that.

1006
01:50:01,377 --> 01:50:08,761
[SPEAKER_19]: So I really do not still have a clue what the range part of this is trying to say.

1007
01:50:08,781 --> 01:50:16,685
[SPEAKER_19]: Because I mean, as a school committee member, I want to know how are the kids in fourth grade

1008
01:50:19,291 --> 01:50:27,154
[SPEAKER_19]: at the Brooks, the first one in that list, what's the range of scores that the fourth graders in science got in the winter?

1009
01:50:27,935 --> 01:50:37,178
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's just, the data looks completely unlike MCAS data, which everybody knows I hate.

1010
01:50:38,478 --> 01:50:45,141
[SPEAKER_19]: It looks different than any other data set we have, which shows that we have a very wide range of,

1011
01:50:46,539 --> 01:50:49,922
[SPEAKER_19]: outcomes for kids at different schools.

1012
01:50:50,122 --> 01:51:04,554
[SPEAKER_19]: Yet, if you look at this, frankly, the Brooks is doing worse in science than the McGlynn, and the McGlynn and the Missituk are doing identically almost, and the Roberts looks a lot like the Brooks.

1013
01:51:05,034 --> 01:51:07,416
[SPEAKER_19]: I just don't think that this is what this is saying.

1014
01:51:08,157 --> 01:51:10,799
[SPEAKER_20]: It is saying it based on where the school is.

1015
01:51:10,899 --> 01:51:13,321
[SPEAKER_20]: This was the first time that the assessment was given.

1016
01:51:15,941 --> 01:51:28,652
[SPEAKER_20]: What you're seeing, this range of numbers showed us when we were looking at the data that the schools are performing similarly on this diagnostic assessment.

1017
01:51:29,373 --> 01:51:32,676
[SPEAKER_20]: So these numbers are not individual students.

1018
01:51:32,736 --> 01:51:35,298
[SPEAKER_20]: It was the entire grade level.

1019
01:51:39,242 --> 01:51:53,814
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, this is, no, exactly how Mr. Sealy explained it, but when you put the report, it showed you this was, I was using the term range of scores, but the median number was in the middle, and we were exceeding.

1020
01:51:55,055 --> 01:52:07,619
[SPEAKER_20]: the median score, which is why we included the table, in almost every, there were a few areas that were outliers, but it wasn't even an outlier by significantly.

1021
01:52:07,639 --> 01:52:12,741
[SPEAKER_20]: It might have been a difference of one point, and by the, and again, this is showing growth.

1022
01:52:13,381 --> 01:52:22,324
[SPEAKER_20]: But by the time the second or third administration of the assessment was given, students showed significant growth.

1023
01:52:23,951 --> 01:52:26,273
[SPEAKER_20]: at some particular grade levels.

1024
01:52:26,734 --> 01:52:29,376
[SPEAKER_20]: Science, the assessment was only given twice.

1025
01:52:29,436 --> 01:52:48,153
[SPEAKER_20]: It was given in the winter and in the spring, but for ELA and math, those assessments were given three times, and you could see the growth, and there were a few areas that there was not as much growth, but we also realized that this year there was a pandemic,

1026
01:52:48,954 --> 01:52:55,179
[SPEAKER_20]: This year was the first time that the students were being introduced to this new assessment system.

1027
01:52:55,639 --> 01:52:58,261
[SPEAKER_20]: So we also took that into consideration.

1028
01:52:58,721 --> 01:53:04,426
[SPEAKER_20]: We also took into consideration that we had some significant attendance issues.

1029
01:53:04,966 --> 01:53:08,028
[SPEAKER_20]: So we had to do makeup tests and

1030
01:53:09,048 --> 01:53:18,757
[SPEAKER_20]: We also had some people that might have taken the assessment the first time and not really put their best foot forward they just were like I want to just hurry up and get it done.

1031
01:53:19,358 --> 01:53:25,704
[SPEAKER_20]: So despite that, for me, looking at this data and looking at what the medium scores were.

1032
01:53:27,088 --> 01:53:45,438
[SPEAKER_20]: As a district, we were aligned that the majority of the district was performing at or above the non-referenced median score, which some were 50th percentile, some were 70th percentile when you average the entire grade level.

1033
01:53:46,018 --> 01:53:46,299
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1034
01:53:48,410 --> 01:53:52,431
[SPEAKER_19]: The median, I think everybody can understand that.

1035
01:53:52,571 --> 01:53:54,912
[SPEAKER_19]: Are these the error bars if this was a graph?

1036
01:53:55,372 --> 01:54:01,153
[SPEAKER_19]: Like 200, this is the error bars if it was in a graphical form.

1037
01:54:01,293 --> 01:54:03,734
[SPEAKER_19]: I've never seen these displayed as numbers.

1038
01:54:03,774 --> 01:54:15,657
[SPEAKER_19]: I've only ever seen them actually displayed as a graph where you have the line and then you have a box where there's above and below and you can get a sense of how much you can trust the actual number.

1039
01:54:17,037 --> 01:54:24,659
[SPEAKER_19]: So these other numbers outside of the median are telling you essentially how trustworthy that median is.

1040
01:54:25,319 --> 01:54:25,820
[SPEAKER_20]: Exactly.

1041
01:54:25,860 --> 01:54:29,181
[SPEAKER_20]: So the median numbers were even higher.

1042
01:54:29,541 --> 01:54:33,822
[SPEAKER_20]: So the numbers that I was actually saying were the lower end.

1043
01:54:34,102 --> 01:54:45,485
[SPEAKER_20]: So for example, since we were still on science, if I look at 10th grade in science,

1044
01:54:48,606 --> 01:54:59,476
[SPEAKER_20]: 213 was the recommended median score, and we had 219, 220 was the actual median, and 221.

1045
01:54:59,937 --> 01:55:08,425
[SPEAKER_20]: So we were higher, we performed better than what, we performed above the 50th percentile.

1046
01:55:08,985 --> 01:55:11,468
[SPEAKER_20]: So the 219, if you looked at,

1047
01:55:14,794 --> 01:55:29,145
[SPEAKER_20]: 10th grade, the 219th was one increment lower than the 220, so we were closer to like the 69th percentile at ninth grade, which is very good.

1048
01:55:30,836 --> 01:55:45,884
[SPEAKER_20]: It's something that you should, I mean, I was pleased when I saw this data because I actually had no idea where we were going to perform with last year being a remote year, trying to get back to some sense of normalcy.

1049
01:55:46,365 --> 01:55:48,566
[SPEAKER_20]: This is the first time that it took place.

1050
01:55:49,246 --> 01:55:51,707
[SPEAKER_20]: We had almost complete data set.

1051
01:55:52,888 --> 01:55:56,270
[SPEAKER_20]: We have middle school finishing the literacy this week.

1052
01:55:57,987 --> 01:56:08,975
[SPEAKER_20]: and being able to look at it as this is a first step, this is our baseline, this is diagnostic, and then we can use this to continue to inform instruction and next steps.

1053
01:56:11,077 --> 01:56:13,839
[SPEAKER_20]: Director Sierra has an additional comment.

1054
01:56:16,562 --> 01:56:19,483
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a point of clarification on Mr. Rousseau's point.

1055
01:56:20,003 --> 01:56:21,163
[SPEAKER_01]: You are correct.

1056
01:56:21,303 --> 01:56:29,405
[SPEAKER_01]: These are plus minus error bars around the median, which is sort of like give you the reliability of the median score.

1057
01:56:30,245 --> 01:56:32,385
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's accurate.

1058
01:56:33,386 --> 01:56:39,127
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't put the plus minus in, and so that does lead to a little bit of confusion when you're looking at the data.

1059
01:56:39,347 --> 01:56:44,868
[SPEAKER_01]: And that'll apply to all of the tables you will see from this point on.

1060
01:56:49,039 --> 01:56:50,361
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Madam Superintendent.

1061
01:56:51,223 --> 01:56:51,624
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1062
01:56:52,605 --> 01:56:54,428
[SPEAKER_20]: I was going to have us move on to math.

1063
01:56:56,652 --> 01:57:01,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I just ask a question about science before we move past science, if that's OK?

1064
01:57:02,417 --> 01:57:08,883
[SPEAKER_04]: On the summary, you mentioned that at grade nine, the exam is representing all science domains.

1065
01:57:08,923 --> 01:57:17,451
[SPEAKER_04]: However, we don't teach that way in high school, so we wouldn't expect this to represent or demonstrate growth.

1066
01:57:18,592 --> 01:57:24,578
[SPEAKER_04]: I think my question is, if we know that, why are we going to test at ninth grade?

1067
01:57:26,089 --> 01:57:35,592
[SPEAKER_20]: When we still take the we have the science MCAS that so all of this I feel this is helping the students to prepare for the state exams as well.

1068
01:57:36,372 --> 01:57:40,494
[SPEAKER_20]: And also just to inform the instruction that's taking place so in ninth grade.

1069
01:57:42,375 --> 01:57:47,058
[SPEAKER_20]: It's intro to physics, earth and space science, biology and chemistry.

1070
01:57:47,639 --> 01:57:59,168
[SPEAKER_20]: And so we are having students take the biology exam, but they're being exposed to multiple content and they are taking those classes between ninth and 10th grade.

1071
01:57:59,848 --> 01:58:05,773
[SPEAKER_20]: So are you saying you would prefer that ninth grade and 10th grade not take any science assessment?

1072
01:58:05,813 --> 01:58:07,354
[SPEAKER_20]: I guess I'm trying to understand your question.

1073
01:58:07,887 --> 01:58:22,576
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think I'm trying to understand the value of another test if we know that it is not demonstrating growth, because structurally, we're not teaching that way.

1074
01:58:23,116 --> 01:58:30,981
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we're teaching biology, we would not expect rounded growth in physics, for example, if we're teaching biology.

1075
01:58:31,041 --> 01:58:36,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, nothing's going to change about my knowledge of physics so long as I take biology.

1076
01:58:36,863 --> 01:58:52,098
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I guess my question is like, why are we testing kids for one more time if we don't, and I'm really genuinely asking, like, what is the value to the instructional staff to know that nothing is changing?

1077
01:58:54,280 --> 01:59:01,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Could they use that time better to instruct not taking a test?

1078
01:59:04,395 --> 01:59:31,383
[SPEAKER_20]: So when I think about the, and this is just me saying my thought about the assessment, when you are instructing, and where I talked about the data-informed instruction and the cycles of learning, these assessments allow teachers, it's fully aligned to the Massachusetts curriculum frameworks, so it is aligned to the content, the standards that have to be taught anyway.

1079
01:59:32,123 --> 01:59:40,512
[SPEAKER_20]: So the teachers can use this data, give an assessment, have a piece of data to inform their next steps.

1080
01:59:40,712 --> 01:59:48,720
[SPEAKER_20]: It identifies areas where students do have weaknesses, and it identifies areas where students do have their strengths.

1081
01:59:49,341 --> 01:59:50,482
[SPEAKER_20]: So I feel like

1082
01:59:51,483 --> 02:00:03,149
[SPEAKER_20]: In the absence of not having an informal assessment system, when we used to give the MCAS, well, we still give the MCAS, it's a requirement of the state, you never got the results until the following October.

1083
02:00:03,469 --> 02:00:09,572
[SPEAKER_20]: So those students were never in front of you to be able to go back and make adjustments to your instruction and learning.

1084
02:00:10,392 --> 02:00:14,114
[SPEAKER_20]: So, I mean, even at the science level,

1085
02:00:16,269 --> 02:00:26,958
[SPEAKER_20]: Although they're not able to measure growth the same way, and the MCAS is only given in science in fifth grade, eighth grade, and at the high school level once, ninth or 10th grade.

1086
02:00:26,998 --> 02:00:28,499
[SPEAKER_20]: I think now we're doing it in ninth grade.

1087
02:00:29,360 --> 02:00:31,542
[SPEAKER_20]: This tool can still be used to

1088
02:00:33,162 --> 02:00:43,625
[SPEAKER_20]: reinforce the content, show the content, and give the teacher an additional measure of what do the students know, what have they acquired, and what haven't they acquired?

1089
02:00:44,125 --> 02:00:52,267
[SPEAKER_20]: And again, are they above the 50th percentile on this norm reference test, or do they need additional support?

1090
02:00:52,587 --> 02:00:54,248
[SPEAKER_20]: We didn't have that data before.

1091
02:00:54,268 --> 02:00:55,828
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, and I see.

1092
02:00:56,668 --> 02:00:58,269
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Cieri.

1093
02:01:02,795 --> 02:01:08,301
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with Dr. Benson on this.

1094
02:01:08,381 --> 02:01:13,367
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that the exam does provide the educators with information.

1095
02:01:14,690 --> 02:01:32,531
[SPEAKER_01]: And although we may not be able to use growth in the same way with the NWA map because it gives you the domains, the four domains, having information about biology or life sciences as it's reported out on the NWA map is valuable.

1096
02:01:32,911 --> 02:01:37,936
[SPEAKER_01]: to the educators as is the information on chemistry in the following year.

1097
02:01:39,057 --> 02:01:40,458
[SPEAKER_01]: It does give you a starting point.

1098
02:01:41,099 --> 02:01:54,450
[SPEAKER_01]: There are other types of reports that the classroom teacher can access that allows them to see the student readiness for particular types of standards.

1099
02:01:56,131 --> 02:02:03,274
[SPEAKER_01]: that fall under the biology standards at grade 9 and then under the chemistry standards at grade 10.

1100
02:02:03,834 --> 02:02:16,719
[SPEAKER_01]: So while they don't make a test exclusively for biology and chemistry, we believe that the information that we can glean from the exam is valuable enough that we

1101
02:02:18,266 --> 02:02:25,268
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we can use it in classroom instruction, which is the first place of thinking about what we would get.

1102
02:02:26,568 --> 02:02:35,131
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also sort of like the broad understanding of the sciences that is covered with the test, which I also think is valuable.

1103
02:02:36,231 --> 02:02:39,112
[SPEAKER_01]: And just test it on other things at the high school level.

1104
02:02:40,712 --> 02:02:46,374
[SPEAKER_01]: They may see questions on other types of standardized tests that students might be taking.

1105
02:02:47,054 --> 02:02:47,674
[SPEAKER_01]: at some point.

1106
02:02:48,015 --> 02:02:59,341
[SPEAKER_01]: And it gives parents, families, caregivers some view about what might be going on for the students at that level.

1107
02:03:00,802 --> 02:03:12,409
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it directly answers the question, but I'm hoping that that information for the educators is useful and that the testing itself can still be useful.

1108
02:03:15,751 --> 02:03:16,031
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1109
02:03:18,054 --> 02:03:22,899
[SPEAKER_19]: I know we're going to get these reports again in the future.

1110
02:03:22,919 --> 02:03:32,268
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm very happy about that I just I'm just asked that the the perspective of what the school committee might want to know.

1111
02:03:32,288 --> 02:03:37,834
[SPEAKER_19]: Front and center to what the presentation looks like because

1112
02:03:39,629 --> 02:03:49,701
[SPEAKER_19]: I love error bars, I really actually do, because I think they're really important for big data sets and really understanding trends, but I don't think that.

1113
02:03:51,010 --> 02:03:58,736
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, I'm not going to speak for all of us, but I have a hunch none of us ever want to see error bars around this data again.

1114
02:03:58,756 --> 02:04:02,780
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, I looked through this after we got it.

1115
02:04:03,640 --> 02:04:14,289
[SPEAKER_19]: I read it top to bottom more than once because I was like, how can I be so dumb to have no idea what this means, which wasn't a great feeling since I think I'm pretty good at math.

1116
02:04:15,819 --> 02:04:20,921
[SPEAKER_19]: And the story you're telling, you're talking about the medians over and over, and that's the story.

1117
02:04:22,241 --> 02:04:27,223
[SPEAKER_19]: And so, while I get that that NWEA is all about those three numbers.

1118
02:04:27,844 --> 02:04:30,905
[SPEAKER_19]: We're not theoreticians and statisticians and

1119
02:04:31,425 --> 02:04:37,787
[SPEAKER_19]: I think if it's possible to cut it out, it'll make it much easier and simpler to get through.

1120
02:04:38,987 --> 02:04:55,512
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, if they have a button you click to create the presentation for us, I understand that might be hard, but that's just my thoughts on getting this in the future, because I can guarantee a year from now, you will have to explain that all over again.

1121
02:04:57,895 --> 02:04:58,495
[SPEAKER_19]: for all of us.

1122
02:04:59,736 --> 02:05:00,357
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you members.

1123
02:05:00,377 --> 02:05:00,777
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1124
02:05:01,297 --> 02:05:03,639
[SPEAKER_15]: On to page 17.

1125
02:05:04,079 --> 02:05:04,339
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

1126
02:05:04,559 --> 02:05:04,839
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

1127
02:05:05,059 --> 02:05:07,041
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's move forward to math.

1128
02:05:07,621 --> 02:05:08,201
[SPEAKER_20]: Dr. Cushing.

1129
02:05:16,947 --> 02:05:21,249
[SPEAKER_20]: So this table that I showed for both math and for ELA

1130
02:05:24,212 --> 02:05:30,701
[SPEAKER_20]: The goal where you're showing student growth is to be above the 50th percentile.

1131
02:05:31,622 --> 02:05:35,688
[SPEAKER_20]: The same is true when you take the MCAS.

1132
02:05:35,728 --> 02:05:39,413
[SPEAKER_20]: You want to see student growth percentile above 50.

1133
02:05:41,480 --> 02:05:49,187
[SPEAKER_20]: any number above 50, and that's wonderful, because growth is showing measure, it's just showing that you grew.

1134
02:05:49,367 --> 02:05:55,712
[SPEAKER_20]: Everyone can start at a different point, but you're showing growth over the course of the year.

1135
02:05:56,573 --> 02:06:01,197
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's critically important.

1136
02:06:02,898 --> 02:06:07,502
[SPEAKER_20]: In math, Dr. Cushing, if you advance,

1137
02:06:12,660 --> 02:06:18,943
[SPEAKER_20]: Similarly, of what I was saying earlier, the median score for kindergarten was 140.

1138
02:06:20,723 --> 02:06:36,230
[SPEAKER_20]: If you look at our scores, all of them are above 140, and by the end of the year, our kindergarten students, the highest outer range was 165 in the spring assessment.

1139
02:06:36,650 --> 02:06:39,211
[SPEAKER_20]: Dr. Cushing, I'm gonna ask you to just go back one,

1140
02:06:41,658 --> 02:06:51,326
[SPEAKER_20]: The 165 is essentially in the first grade

1141
02:06:52,580 --> 02:06:54,441
[SPEAKER_20]: beginning of year benchmark.

1142
02:06:55,582 --> 02:07:15,434
[SPEAKER_20]: So when you see kindergarten ending a year at a 165, you're able to say like, wow, they showed from kindergarten beginning of year to first grade beginning of year, that's what you wanna be able to see, the growth and the movement in the positive direction, anything moving up.

1143
02:07:15,894 --> 02:07:20,157
[SPEAKER_20]: If we stayed on the kindergarten lane, even though this table here is,

1144
02:07:21,818 --> 02:07:27,700
[SPEAKER_20]: beginning of the year, but the 165 score is off of the chart.

1145
02:07:27,740 --> 02:07:33,662
[SPEAKER_20]: So if we went to 160, that would have been the 95th percentile.

1146
02:07:34,402 --> 02:07:42,305
[SPEAKER_20]: So in terms of growth, the students are showing growth, and that is a very good story.

1147
02:07:43,439 --> 02:07:56,864
[SPEAKER_20]: Not that it's just a story to tell, because we know we're dealing with the whole child, but our students are showing growth this year as we come out of the pandemic with all of the things that we had to work with.

1148
02:07:57,084 --> 02:08:02,766
[SPEAKER_20]: I was not sure if we were going to hit the median or exceed it by the end of the year.

1149
02:08:03,727 --> 02:08:06,768
[SPEAKER_20]: And so, Dr. Cushing, can you go forward again, please?

1150
02:08:09,321 --> 02:08:14,565
[SPEAKER_20]: For first grade, the range was 160 was the median.

1151
02:08:15,685 --> 02:08:20,129
[SPEAKER_20]: And again, we're showing positive movement.

1152
02:08:20,909 --> 02:08:29,955
[SPEAKER_20]: And even for some schools where there was a slight difference, those of you who might look at the McGlynn, for example, you see the 159, the 160, the 162.

1153
02:08:30,015 --> 02:08:30,396
[SPEAKER_20]: The goal of 160

1154
02:08:36,570 --> 02:08:43,593
[SPEAKER_20]: By the end of the year, you can see the growth, which is absolutely wonderful when you look at the ranges.

1155
02:08:46,915 --> 02:08:51,317
[SPEAKER_20]: Second code, the medium score was 175, and

1156
02:08:56,335 --> 02:09:05,538
[SPEAKER_20]: We saw at second grade that there was one that was a little outlier, but the actual median score at the Mississippi was 173.

1157
02:09:06,518 --> 02:09:14,020
[SPEAKER_20]: We were still in the range, very, very close, either above or just right at the tail of that.

1158
02:09:14,700 --> 02:09:17,621
[SPEAKER_20]: Can we move forward to third, fourth, and fifth grade, Dr. Cushing?

1159
02:09:18,602 --> 02:09:22,783
[SPEAKER_20]: The story is similar in third grade.

1160
02:09:25,244 --> 02:09:27,565
[SPEAKER_20]: 188 was the median score that we were looking for.

1161
02:09:27,585 --> 02:09:34,148
[SPEAKER_20]: Fourth grade was 200.

1162
02:09:37,811 --> 02:09:53,342
[SPEAKER_20]: And as we look at fourth grade math scores, again, the first time it was given, students were absent, students had quarantined, but by the end of the year, we moved all the way, we showed significant growth, which is important.

1163
02:09:54,603 --> 02:10:02,888
[SPEAKER_20]: Fifth grade, beginning of the year was a 209, so we had two of the four schools that were within that range.

1164
02:10:04,286 --> 02:10:05,888
[SPEAKER_20]: And again, this is diagnostic.

1165
02:10:05,948 --> 02:10:11,053
[SPEAKER_20]: We're looking at what the median score is and saying, what do our next steps need to be?

1166
02:10:12,014 --> 02:10:14,217
[SPEAKER_20]: Dr. Cushing, can you go to middle school, please?

1167
02:10:17,220 --> 02:10:19,442
[SPEAKER_20]: Middle school was where we did identify

1168
02:10:23,926 --> 02:10:29,871
[SPEAKER_20]: some areas it was 215 for the start of the school year.

1169
02:10:30,752 --> 02:10:36,736
[SPEAKER_20]: And so both schools were not yet at the 215.

1170
02:10:38,358 --> 02:10:43,182
[SPEAKER_20]: In seventh grade, the median score was 220.

1171
02:10:44,603 --> 02:10:49,166
[SPEAKER_20]: And again, we do see a slight difference.

1172
02:10:50,765 --> 02:10:55,529
[SPEAKER_20]: but we're looking at the range and seeing where they ended up by the end of the year.

1173
02:10:57,090 --> 02:11:08,940
[SPEAKER_20]: Eighth grade, the median score was 225, and we did see that that was an area that we were able to identify as this is an area we need to work on.

1174
02:11:11,142 --> 02:11:11,903
[SPEAKER_20]: High school please.

1175
02:11:13,484 --> 02:11:17,247
[SPEAKER_20]: Ninth grade, the median range was 226.

1176
02:11:24,389 --> 02:11:26,371
[SPEAKER_20]: And for 10th grade, it was 229.

1177
02:11:26,491 --> 02:11:33,056
[SPEAKER_20]: So we were right at the cusp, 230 in high school.

1178
02:11:34,697 --> 02:11:36,378
[SPEAKER_20]: Next slide, Dr. Cushing, thank you.

1179
02:11:36,938 --> 02:11:37,879
[SPEAKER_20]: The math summary.

1180
02:11:40,741 --> 02:11:44,304
[SPEAKER_20]: The NWEA map test was given three times this year.

1181
02:11:46,746 --> 02:11:47,606
[SPEAKER_20]: Fall results.

1182
02:11:48,700 --> 02:11:56,804
[SPEAKER_20]: were higher than the reported median scores, and we identified the few schools that were slightly lower than the median score.

1183
02:11:57,904 --> 02:12:05,328
[SPEAKER_20]: We also were able to show growth by all schools between the fall and the winter testing periods.

1184
02:12:05,888 --> 02:12:15,293
[SPEAKER_20]: So again, I feel like the essential message is that this was a good story in terms of first time being given this assessment,

1185
02:12:16,714 --> 02:12:26,702
[SPEAKER_20]: first time having the professional development and really being able to do this deeper analysis, data analysis with an in-house tool.

1186
02:12:28,764 --> 02:12:31,025
[SPEAKER_20]: Dr. Cushing, can you go forward to ELA, please?

1187
02:12:33,007 --> 02:12:36,290
[SPEAKER_20]: Similar format where I'm showing you the median scores.

1188
02:12:38,251 --> 02:12:40,013
[SPEAKER_20]: And so at the elementary level,

1189
02:12:43,506 --> 02:12:55,854
[SPEAKER_20]: 137.

1190
02:12:44,327 --> 02:12:55,854
[SPEAKER_20]: Our kindergartens were, the majority of them were above, and then McGlynn School was exactly at 137 during the first administration.

1191
02:12:56,315 --> 02:13:01,959
[SPEAKER_20]: But by the time they took the assessment in the spring, we saw significant growth and movement.

1192
02:13:05,456 --> 02:13:07,617
[SPEAKER_20]: 159 was the outer range of kindergarten.

1193
02:13:07,998 --> 02:13:10,259
[SPEAKER_20]: Again, it was off the chart.

1194
02:13:10,379 --> 02:13:15,743
[SPEAKER_20]: Even though this was a fall assessment, but saying we saw significant movement in growth.

1195
02:13:16,584 --> 02:13:17,845
[SPEAKER_20]: First grade, it was 156.

1196
02:13:19,026 --> 02:13:23,049
[SPEAKER_20]: We had two schools that were slightly lower in first grade.

1197
02:13:23,109 --> 02:13:25,010
[SPEAKER_20]: The others were above that number of 156.

1198
02:13:27,612 --> 02:13:39,347
[SPEAKER_20]: In second grade, we had 172, and we had one school that was, their range was a little bit lower, but again, the median was exactly 172.

1199
02:13:39,387 --> 02:13:40,048
[SPEAKER_20]: Moving to third grade,

1200
02:13:44,755 --> 02:13:57,981
[SPEAKER_20]: The median score was 187, and all of our school, we had one school that slightly missed the mark, but their median score at the Missituk third grade was 186.

1201
02:14:00,142 --> 02:14:11,327
[SPEAKER_20]: Fourth grade, the median score was 197, and all of our fourth grade at all four schools were above that median score.

1202
02:14:13,667 --> 02:14:31,025
[SPEAKER_20]: Fifth grade, the median score was 204, and at the McGlynn, the score in the middle was 204, the outer range was 202, but all of the other schools were above the 204.

1203
02:14:32,386 --> 02:14:33,047
[SPEAKER_06]: Middle schools,

1204
02:14:40,689 --> 02:14:48,153
[SPEAKER_20]: At the middle school levels grade six, the median score was 210, and both schools were above that.

1205
02:14:48,753 --> 02:14:56,738
[SPEAKER_20]: However, between the fall and the winter, we did see almost some like static movement.

1206
02:14:57,890 --> 02:15:04,912
[SPEAKER_20]: In seventh grade, the median score was 214, and respectively, we had 222 and 217, which were significantly above the 214.

1207
02:15:04,952 --> 02:15:09,753
[SPEAKER_20]: In the eighth grade, the median score was 218, and again, we had a range, one school slightly behind.

1208
02:15:11,013 --> 02:15:13,133
[SPEAKER_20]: At the high school, the median score

1209
02:15:28,049 --> 02:15:35,495
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, at the high school, the median score was 219, and we were significantly above that at the high school level.

1210
02:15:36,015 --> 02:15:42,401
[SPEAKER_20]: Grade nine and grade 10 was 221, and we were above that as well.

1211
02:15:43,381 --> 02:15:56,332
[SPEAKER_20]: And so the summary on our ELA for the fall to winter results, again, K to two, we saw growth at all schools.

1212
02:15:58,976 --> 02:16:04,161
[SPEAKER_20]: Grade three, we showed growth at all schools from fall to winter with the exception of one.

1213
02:16:04,722 --> 02:16:11,128
[SPEAKER_20]: Grades four and five, we showed all-on growth at all schools with the exception of one, which remained static.

1214
02:16:12,069 --> 02:16:17,734
[SPEAKER_20]: Elementary, winter to spring results, we showed growth at grades K to three.

1215
02:16:18,695 --> 02:16:21,737
[SPEAKER_20]: compared to our winter results, winter to spring.

1216
02:16:22,397 --> 02:16:27,240
[SPEAKER_20]: In grade four, remained fairly static.

1217
02:16:27,440 --> 02:16:30,542
[SPEAKER_20]: Grade five, we showed a slight decrease.

1218
02:16:30,562 --> 02:16:40,107
[SPEAKER_20]: In grade six through 12, we showed decreases in growth from the fall to the winter.

1219
02:16:42,570 --> 02:16:46,334
[SPEAKER_20]: And again, at one school, it remained static.

1220
02:16:46,574 --> 02:16:51,238
[SPEAKER_20]: At the high school, we showed increases compared from winter to spring.

1221
02:16:52,594 --> 02:16:56,197
[SPEAKER_20]: And the spring results for the middle school will be available in mid-June.

1222
02:16:56,217 --> 02:17:02,581
[SPEAKER_20]: And we are anticipating to see growth levels at those two schools.

1223
02:17:02,621 --> 02:17:05,703
[SPEAKER_20]: So we will update the slide deck once that data is available.

1224
02:17:05,723 --> 02:17:12,768
[SPEAKER_20]: And all K-12 faculty have been trained again, as I said earlier, in data analysis.

1225
02:17:13,289 --> 02:17:17,652
[SPEAKER_20]: And they spent time having professional development on how to use this tool.

1226
02:17:18,372 --> 02:17:24,675
[SPEAKER_20]: during department meetings, principal meetings, and they spent time examining their data.

1227
02:17:24,695 --> 02:17:37,060
[SPEAKER_20]: And as this data examination happens, it promotes, it prompts a shift in instruction, which is part of the data cycle.

1228
02:17:38,453 --> 02:17:46,463
[SPEAKER_20]: So our summary of actions, we are continuing to do data analysis with principals and curriculum directors.

1229
02:17:48,245 --> 02:17:53,852
[SPEAKER_20]: And through the use of NWEA and the data that is available,

1230
02:17:54,873 --> 02:17:59,196
[SPEAKER_20]: These are based on the individual student rate scores.

1231
02:17:59,716 --> 02:18:07,040
[SPEAKER_20]: We are able to align Lexia Core 5, Lexia Power Up, Nuzella, and Khan Academy, the mappers.

1232
02:18:07,581 --> 02:18:20,748
[SPEAKER_20]: So these are supplemental resources that we have as a district that speak to the NWEA map assessment so there can be individualized targeted support work there.

1233
02:18:22,109 --> 02:18:25,756
[SPEAKER_20]: Also, the use of data based on analysis.

1234
02:18:26,357 --> 02:18:31,645
[SPEAKER_20]: It is promoting adjustments in instruction at all discipline levels.

1235
02:18:32,407 --> 02:18:33,549
[SPEAKER_20]: Dr. Cushing, thank you.

1236
02:18:35,876 --> 02:18:42,621
[SPEAKER_20]: So if necessary, we can make adjustments to our wind block, our response to interventions.

1237
02:18:43,081 --> 02:18:47,744
[SPEAKER_20]: If tier two support is needed, we can provide that support based on data.

1238
02:18:48,585 --> 02:18:56,730
[SPEAKER_20]: We also can provide enrichment opportunities for students that show that they are hitting those benchmarks and doing very well.

1239
02:18:56,750 --> 02:19:04,755
[SPEAKER_20]: And then there are shifts in instructional resources, if necessary, based on the information that is revealed from the data.

1240
02:19:05,997 --> 02:19:08,405
[SPEAKER_20]: Lastly, I just want to share the next steps.

1241
02:19:10,666 --> 02:19:24,650
[SPEAKER_20]: that we have the after action review where we are, teachers have been meeting in whether it's grade level teams and department teams providing feedback on the testing and testing protocols.

1242
02:19:25,470 --> 02:19:37,334
[SPEAKER_20]: We have realized that we're going to be modifying the district assessment calendar and teachers will have access to baseline data.

1243
02:19:38,414 --> 02:19:49,900
[SPEAKER_20]: at the start of the school year, which will help them to be able to measure and assess potential summertime learning loss when we begin the process again at the start of the school year.

1244
02:19:50,881 --> 02:19:51,281
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1245
02:19:52,521 --> 02:19:53,782
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

1246
02:19:54,502 --> 02:19:55,683
[SPEAKER_15]: Are there any further questions?

1247
02:19:56,904 --> 02:19:58,965
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Ruseau, Member Hays, Member Graham.

1248
02:19:59,805 --> 02:20:00,185
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1249
02:20:00,846 --> 02:20:04,788
[SPEAKER_19]: Were any student results

1250
02:20:06,576 --> 02:20:10,638
[SPEAKER_19]: removed from the data set used for evaluation to provide these numbers.

1251
02:20:10,838 --> 02:20:13,700
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm thinking about newcomers and EL students.

1252
02:20:14,540 --> 02:20:18,042
[SPEAKER_19]: My understanding is the exams were only available in English.

1253
02:20:19,346 --> 02:20:25,251
[SPEAKER_19]: And I would hazard that a newcomer filling this out would get close to a zero as you can get.

1254
02:20:26,432 --> 02:20:30,155
[SPEAKER_20]: So newcomers are not taking this assessment yet.

1255
02:20:30,436 --> 02:20:37,021
[SPEAKER_20]: Neither are any of our students with disabilities that qualify for the MCAS alt.

1256
02:20:37,522 --> 02:20:43,446
[SPEAKER_20]: So those students do not have to participate in NWEA map testing.

1257
02:20:44,087 --> 02:20:46,689
[SPEAKER_20]: We've also had some families

1258
02:20:47,970 --> 02:20:53,593
[SPEAKER_20]: speak to administrators to say that they don't want to participate in the assessment.

1259
02:20:54,413 --> 02:20:59,515
[SPEAKER_20]: And again, it is a diagnostic tool so it does serve a purpose.

1260
02:20:59,535 --> 02:21:08,980
[SPEAKER_20]: There's a lot of information where once you identify the area that a student needs help, it's targeted, it's pinpointed, and you can make those

1261
02:21:09,620 --> 02:21:10,881
[SPEAKER_20]: necessary adjustments.

1262
02:21:11,421 --> 02:21:21,026
[SPEAKER_20]: So I am hoping that we are really able to continue to use this as a diagnostic tool so we can see where we are and say, this is where we need to move.

1263
02:21:21,667 --> 02:21:31,332
[SPEAKER_20]: This NWEA can be used as like a blueprint, print a roadmap to help inform instruction.

1264
02:21:31,372 --> 02:21:36,195
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not taking over what the teachers are doing, but it's just another piece of data

1265
02:21:36,815 --> 02:21:41,256
[SPEAKER_20]: that can help to inform instruction and say, okay, this is where I need to double down.

1266
02:21:41,597 --> 02:21:43,937
[SPEAKER_20]: This is where the students are really strong and solid.

1267
02:21:44,277 --> 02:21:46,178
[SPEAKER_20]: We can move on to the next concept.

1268
02:21:46,938 --> 02:21:47,799
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1269
02:21:48,479 --> 02:21:51,760
[SPEAKER_19]: So for the EL students, they did take it and they're included in the data set?

1270
02:21:52,820 --> 02:21:55,661
[SPEAKER_20]: For EL students, yes.

1271
02:21:55,861 --> 02:21:58,602
[SPEAKER_20]: Newcomers, no.

1272
02:21:58,942 --> 02:22:04,324
[SPEAKER_19]: That's the- That's good that we didn't put the newcomers down in front of a computer where it was all in English.

1273
02:22:05,984 --> 02:22:17,372
[SPEAKER_19]: But how many instructional, I don't know if it, I don't know, like at the different levels, I'm sure this is very different, but in an elementary classroom, is it a whole day of it?

1274
02:22:17,412 --> 02:22:22,756
[SPEAKER_19]: How many instructional days per, let's just do elementary, because it's frankly easier to do the.

1275
02:22:24,077 --> 02:22:25,378
[SPEAKER_19]: the mental gymnastics around.

1276
02:22:27,018 --> 02:22:35,281
[SPEAKER_19]: How many days in the school year did a elementary teacher spend doing just NWEA?

1277
02:22:35,561 --> 02:22:39,302
[SPEAKER_20]: I think it might have been, I wouldn't say, it might be like two days.

1278
02:22:39,322 --> 02:22:45,164
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't have the specifics for the amount of time, but it would not be the entire school day.

1279
02:22:45,204 --> 02:22:46,324
[SPEAKER_20]: So they may have used

1280
02:22:47,024 --> 02:23:10,506
[SPEAKER_20]: two blocks or three blocks, I'm not sure of the exact amount of time that was used to administer the assessment because this was the first time that we used it as a district and that's where we're still in the fact finding, gathering information and seeing how much of the information we can use to inform instruction and how long the assessment does take.

1281
02:23:11,247 --> 02:23:25,661
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you and I think some students are able to go through it at a faster rate than other students and the way the test is designed and if either Dr. Chiesa or

1282
02:23:27,503 --> 02:23:39,845
[SPEAKER_20]: Rocco Sierra, you wanna speak to this, or Faiza Khan, depending on how you perform on the NW, like the better you're doing, the more it adds.

1283
02:23:40,686 --> 02:23:50,888
[SPEAKER_20]: So some students end up being able to do more because of how they're performing and it's showing their growth.

1284
02:23:50,908 --> 02:23:51,968
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's not like it,

1285
02:23:52,868 --> 02:23:55,051
[SPEAKER_20]: automatically will just stop with you.

1286
02:23:55,071 --> 02:23:59,876
[SPEAKER_20]: There's some fluidity to it, if that makes sense.

1287
02:23:59,976 --> 02:24:09,606
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, no, I remember that when we were being introduced to it that we, I think, I certainly thought that was one of the better features was that, you know, it kind of goes up and down and

1288
02:24:12,122 --> 02:24:30,270
[SPEAKER_19]: how hard the test is based on the students' responses, which I thought is great, because then we can really see where the student is at on like an MCAS, where if you can't do it, you can't do it, and if it was all easy, then you don't really know anything more about the student either.

1289
02:24:30,410 --> 02:24:34,651
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's good to hear, and I'll let my colleagues ask other questions.

1290
02:24:34,731 --> 02:24:35,052
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1291
02:24:35,592 --> 02:24:36,052
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Hays?

1292
02:24:38,330 --> 02:24:49,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, so my question has to do more with the original resolution that we passed asking for information about the NWA map really didn't talk about the scores.

1293
02:24:49,614 --> 02:24:50,755
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think that's interesting.

1294
02:24:50,775 --> 02:24:53,556
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think parents do want to know that information.

1295
02:24:53,596 --> 02:25:01,879
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that we also have a newer resolution that next year to have regular meetings after each administration to go over the scores.

1296
02:25:02,699 --> 02:25:06,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Our resolution that we passed had more to do with the implementation questions of it.

1297
02:25:07,020 --> 02:25:24,824
[SPEAKER_03]: We had asked, especially since it was, I have the questions right in front of me that were part of the original resolution, that the idea of this assessment, or a large part of the assessment, was to give teachers information, as you said, to inform their instruction.

1298
02:25:25,204 --> 02:25:29,305
[SPEAKER_03]: And so one of our questions, or several of our questions were looking at

1299
02:25:30,125 --> 02:25:42,656
[SPEAKER_03]: getting some more information about how they were using the information specifically, how they were using the data that they got with some really specific examples at different grade levels so we could understand how teachers were using this.

1300
02:25:44,187 --> 02:25:54,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Also wondering, I think one of the questions I hear was asking for the teachers' perceptions of the test, and did it seem to match their perceptions of their students' levels?

1301
02:25:54,092 --> 02:26:03,977
[SPEAKER_03]: We really wanted to understand, or the idea was to understand the assessment itself, and how teachers were perceiving it, how families were perceiving it.

1302
02:26:06,359 --> 02:26:12,362
[SPEAKER_03]: One question was, are special education teachers able to use the math results to inform their IEP goals and objectives?

1303
02:26:13,081 --> 02:26:20,968
[SPEAKER_03]: are English language learners, are those teachers finding they can use the math results to inform their instruction?

1304
02:26:21,468 --> 02:26:32,698
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we did ask, as Mr. Rousseau had just asked, the last question was, how long is it taking for students to complete the assessment at each grade level, and how are the students responding?

1305
02:26:32,718 --> 02:26:35,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Because of course, we know the first go-round of this

1306
02:26:36,505 --> 02:26:37,805
[SPEAKER_03]: We did get a lot of reports.

1307
02:26:37,825 --> 02:26:43,467
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, maybe a lot is too strong, but we were getting reports that some students were very upset by the test.

1308
02:26:44,928 --> 02:26:52,090
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm feeling like this report, while it's got a lot of information, isn't necessarily matching the resolution questions that we had passed.

1309
02:26:52,688 --> 02:26:55,470
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, so I'm gonna ask if either Ms.

1310
02:26:55,490 --> 02:27:05,375
[SPEAKER_20]: Galuse, if you think you can come up to give some feedback and or Dr. Cushing on specifically at the elementary and secondary levels.

1311
02:27:06,135 --> 02:27:14,220
[SPEAKER_20]: With this being the first time that the assessment was given, I have to say that this was a baseline, like we finally went through the full cycle.

1312
02:27:14,240 --> 02:27:19,323
[SPEAKER_20]: And I can say to you, I've seen the sample document that

1313
02:27:20,784 --> 02:27:32,350
[SPEAKER_20]: teachers are using to look at how students have performed and what are next steps to inform what's happening during their response to intervention, their wind blocks.

1314
02:27:33,631 --> 02:27:40,475
[SPEAKER_20]: It is being used to inform instruction and say, what do we need to readdress?

1315
02:27:40,955 --> 02:27:46,379
[SPEAKER_20]: So some of the questions with this being the first go round, I actually feel like we're not gonna get

1316
02:27:47,459 --> 02:28:04,175
[SPEAKER_20]: all of that information until now when it happens next year, because the fact of Mr. Russo's question about when they're taking the test, that the test continues, it continues with you based on how you're performing on the assessment.

1317
02:28:04,575 --> 02:28:09,900
[SPEAKER_20]: But I would love for them to help respond to some of those questions.

1318
02:28:12,184 --> 02:28:12,805
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening.

1319
02:28:13,365 --> 02:28:23,296
[SPEAKER_13]: So in speaking with Dr. Key, as I will say, some of the feedback at the secondary level was that the tests were taking about maps.

1320
02:28:23,769 --> 02:28:32,175
[SPEAKER_13]: feels that each test should take about an hour, but because of the adaptability, there is variation in how long it takes individual students.

1321
02:28:32,215 --> 02:28:43,083
[SPEAKER_13]: So some students, it may take a lot longer as the questions increase in difficulty and challenge to get to their proximal level there.

1322
02:28:44,364 --> 02:28:46,706
[SPEAKER_13]: At the elementary level, it also varied.

1323
02:28:46,926 --> 02:28:52,730
[SPEAKER_13]: So one of the things that we're learning as we're going through this first implementation year,

1324
02:28:53,662 --> 02:29:03,106
[SPEAKER_13]: is that we kind of left, at least I'll speak for elementary, I left the assessment in terms of the teachers, in terms of how they wanted to give it, when they wanted to give it.

1325
02:29:03,146 --> 02:29:08,008
[SPEAKER_13]: They knew they had two to three topics of assessments to give students.

1326
02:29:08,468 --> 02:29:15,371
[SPEAKER_13]: And so some teachers gave them during, let's say, their prescribed or scheduled ELA block, math block.

1327
02:29:16,209 --> 02:29:26,772
[SPEAKER_13]: Those, from the feedback that I'm getting, those took longer than the teachers that said, we're going to take like this morning and get it done in one shot.

1328
02:29:27,132 --> 02:29:35,955
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I think by the time you set up students for an online test, go through the directions, you know, the block, you don't have much time.

1329
02:29:36,395 --> 02:29:44,257
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think it's really hard to stand here and give like a concrete answer in terms of how long it took, because it varied depending on how the teacher

1330
02:29:45,120 --> 02:29:47,081
[SPEAKER_13]: decided to administer the tests.

1331
02:29:47,582 --> 02:29:57,428
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's something that I'm, that we're going to be in conversation to talk about, uh, the next best steps in terms of administering it moving forward.

1332
02:29:58,708 --> 02:30:07,994
[SPEAKER_16]: I would say that at the middle school level in particular, uh, we were noticing in the first assessment administration that, uh, students were taking an extensive amount of time.

1333
02:30:08,414 --> 02:30:12,497
[SPEAKER_16]: We also, uh, allowed a little bit of flexibility as to when teachers gave it.

1334
02:30:13,084 --> 02:30:18,569
[SPEAKER_16]: And we noticed that, lo and behold, there were a few that, when we went to close the window, actually hadn't given it.

1335
02:30:19,350 --> 02:30:22,092
[SPEAKER_16]: So we had to go have some conversations.

1336
02:30:22,272 --> 02:30:28,358
[SPEAKER_16]: I would say our staff did phenomenal, worked really well on it, but there were just a few conversations.

1337
02:30:29,208 --> 02:30:44,582
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, we, um, then, uh, the principals in the middle school and the high school then worked to have more of a strict testing schedule, um, just to really take some of the variability out and to make sure that, uh, the staff, uh, this is the time you're giving it.

1338
02:30:44,762 --> 02:30:47,644
[SPEAKER_16]: And then it also made makeups much easier to be given.

1339
02:30:48,265 --> 02:30:54,030
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, and I know the principals at the two middle schools, uh, really worked to diligently make sure that all students would want

1340
02:30:54,250 --> 02:31:08,055
[SPEAKER_16]: I do think, though, that how the data and how we're using this is best to be answered by our three content directors that I know are also on the call, Dr. Chiesa, Faisal Khan, and Rocco Sieri.

1341
02:31:08,735 --> 02:31:16,237
[SPEAKER_16]: And I see Dr. Chiesa's hand up, but I think that they're the ones who are really working directly with teachers to make sure that this

1342
02:31:18,158 --> 02:31:33,308
[SPEAKER_16]: significant investment in district resources is put to the maximum use to really enhance an educator's effectiveness with students and support their efforts, as well as to support the maximum outcome for our students.

1343
02:31:33,849 --> 02:31:34,189
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1344
02:31:34,249 --> 02:31:34,929
[SPEAKER_15]: Dr. Chiesa?

1345
02:31:54,267 --> 02:31:54,808
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, here we go.

1346
02:31:55,168 --> 02:31:55,908
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, can you hear me okay?

1347
02:31:56,028 --> 02:31:57,109
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't unmute, sorry.

1348
02:31:59,391 --> 02:32:00,071
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you able to hear me?

1349
02:32:00,832 --> 02:32:01,632
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we can hear you now.

1350
02:32:02,493 --> 02:32:02,833
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1351
02:32:03,834 --> 02:32:07,977
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to follow up on what Dr. Cushing and Ms.

1352
02:32:08,197 --> 02:32:16,123
[SPEAKER_00]: Galussi said, it definitely, we are adjusting the schedule in terms of looking at the length of time

1353
02:32:16,650 --> 02:32:20,776
[SPEAKER_00]: that it takes students to test, but I feel like they've both spoken beautifully to that.

1354
02:32:21,697 --> 02:32:32,613
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of looking at the data, one of the, I have to say that my humanities staff has done a wonderful job taking the time to look at the data in department meetings.

1355
02:32:33,700 --> 02:32:49,595
[SPEAKER_00]: And other meetings as well and one of the things for English, or for the reading assessment that we do see is the class report, which is something that we can look at as a department allows us to break down.

1356
02:32:50,456 --> 02:32:55,200
[SPEAKER_00]: more of the different components of ELA.

1357
02:32:55,581 --> 02:33:01,305
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to give us information on how the students are doing with informational texts, key ideas and details.

1358
02:33:01,386 --> 02:33:05,249
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to give us data on literary texts.

1359
02:33:05,949 --> 02:33:09,392
[SPEAKER_00]: There's five different sections, five different categories.

1360
02:33:09,853 --> 02:33:11,014
[SPEAKER_00]: From that, we can

1361
02:33:11,570 --> 02:33:20,274
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of drill down class by class to see where some of the greater deficits lie, where the strengths lie.

1362
02:33:21,215 --> 02:33:25,497
[SPEAKER_00]: The middle school was able to do this in a very diligent way.

1363
02:33:25,997 --> 02:33:38,924
[SPEAKER_00]: And also we were able to team up with the social studies and ELA teachers as well, so that if we saw a deficit in, let's say, informational text key ideas, the social studies teacher and the ELA teacher

1364
02:33:39,414 --> 02:33:48,581
[SPEAKER_00]: began to come up with different strategies and also look at different resources of how we can work with those students on those areas.

1365
02:33:48,601 --> 02:33:54,626
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if that answers all the questions, but that's an example of some of the work that has been done.

1366
02:33:56,348 --> 02:33:57,389
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Dr. Chiesa.

1367
02:33:59,330 --> 02:34:05,215
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess if I can say, I think big picture, the purpose of this resolution was really to understand better

1368
02:34:06,118 --> 02:34:15,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Is the investment in time and really, I guess, time for the students, time for the teachers, is it giving us the bang for the buck that we want?

1369
02:34:15,281 --> 02:34:25,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Since the goal was to give teachers a better tool, a better assessment for informing their instruction, because MCAS has long been obsolete for that purpose.

1370
02:34:27,625 --> 02:34:33,526
[SPEAKER_03]: We wanted to know, is the amount of money and time that's being spent on this, is it worth it?

1371
02:34:34,187 --> 02:34:34,807
[SPEAKER_20]: Absolutely.

1372
02:34:36,997 --> 02:34:45,500
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not feeling like the information I got in this particular presentation gives me enough detail to know that for sure.

1373
02:34:45,781 --> 02:34:55,665
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not that I don't trust you, but I really, we tried very hard in this resolution to be very specific about the questions you were asking so you would know what information we were looking for.

1374
02:34:55,685 --> 02:35:04,248
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't, I don't feel like we got it in this presentation is, you know, as well put together as this presentation was.

1375
02:35:04,775 --> 02:35:10,760
[SPEAKER_03]: We did get the scores, but really the gist of this resolution wasn't about the scores and what are the scores showing us.

1376
02:35:10,860 --> 02:35:14,182
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, how is the assessment working for the teachers?

1377
02:35:14,843 --> 02:35:26,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it, you know, again, is there a lot of time being spent in this that's not necessarily translating to, you know, enough information for teachers to really make a difference in their teaching?

1378
02:35:27,139 --> 02:35:34,564
[SPEAKER_20]: So my response back would be that Medford never had an assessment system outside of the MCAS.

1379
02:35:35,024 --> 02:35:49,814
[SPEAKER_20]: So there was no way that teachers could have the same conversation across all four elementary schools or both middle schools to look at data and say, this is where my students are performing.

1380
02:35:50,334 --> 02:35:57,116
[SPEAKER_20]: right now, whether we went with NWEA map assessment, but we never had anything.

1381
02:35:57,576 --> 02:36:07,218
[SPEAKER_20]: So in the absence of having an in-house assessment tool to use as a diagnostic tool to inform instruction, it just didn't exist.

1382
02:36:07,678 --> 02:36:10,159
[SPEAKER_20]: So you weren't able to get to coherence.

1383
02:36:11,019 --> 02:36:17,781
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a similar conversation that I had with the committee when we had five different math programs between two middle schools.

1384
02:36:18,661 --> 02:36:28,932
[SPEAKER_20]: You were using five different programs, how are you getting one, a clear picture on how the students were truly performing, because you did not have the same system.

1385
02:36:29,513 --> 02:36:39,624
[SPEAKER_20]: So in order to bring about coherence in order to say we're moving the district forward, you have to have some kind of data assessment system in place.

1386
02:36:40,445 --> 02:36:42,887
[SPEAKER_20]: As a district, we went with the NWEA map.

1387
02:36:43,307 --> 02:36:53,453
[SPEAKER_20]: It could have been iReady, it could have been others, but we were using NWEA map, and we're getting data now that at least tells us that's norm referenced.

1388
02:36:53,933 --> 02:36:54,974
[SPEAKER_20]: Are we on track?

1389
02:36:55,814 --> 02:36:57,095
[SPEAKER_20]: or are we off track?

1390
02:36:57,276 --> 02:36:59,037
[SPEAKER_20]: Are we hitting that median score?

1391
02:36:59,077 --> 02:37:00,178
[SPEAKER_20]: Are we doing it or not?

1392
02:37:00,859 --> 02:37:08,006
[SPEAKER_20]: So a year ago, if you asked me, I would be like, well, we'll wait until the MCAS comes out, and then we'll be able to tell you something.

1393
02:37:08,566 --> 02:37:19,096
[SPEAKER_20]: This is the first time that I have data outside of the MCAS that I'm able to just at least say in the month of June, wow, you can see the growth.

1394
02:37:19,176 --> 02:37:20,498
[SPEAKER_20]: This was the median score.

1395
02:37:21,198 --> 02:37:22,139
[SPEAKER_20]: This is our range.

1396
02:37:22,399 --> 02:37:24,600
[SPEAKER_20]: This is where we started in September, October.

1397
02:37:25,061 --> 02:37:36,068
[SPEAKER_20]: This is where our students ended up in June, so it's something if I'm just saying in the absence of not having anything and saying that we can't test students.

1398
02:37:37,049 --> 02:37:43,135
[SPEAKER_20]: how are teachers, how are parents gonna be able to say, how is my child actually doing?

1399
02:37:43,735 --> 02:37:46,738
[SPEAKER_20]: Now they can actually look and say, oh, this is the median score.

1400
02:37:47,379 --> 02:37:59,069
[SPEAKER_20]: This is where my child performs when they receive their, whether it's the fall or winter results, they can look at it and say, okay, you're doing well.

1401
02:37:59,230 --> 02:38:01,051
[SPEAKER_20]: When you get your MCAS report card,

1402
02:38:02,392 --> 02:38:14,784
[SPEAKER_20]: The following school year in October, the report card spells out for you is your child, you know, meeting the benchmark or not and they do a nice little graph and that that's part of the parent report card.

1403
02:38:15,264 --> 02:38:18,988
[SPEAKER_20]: So I do feel it's worth the investment, we never had it before.

1404
02:38:19,668 --> 02:38:22,831
[SPEAKER_20]: And to try to be moving instruction forward.

1405
02:38:23,272 --> 02:38:25,113
[SPEAKER_20]: We are a school first and foremost.

1406
02:38:25,814 --> 02:38:27,635
[SPEAKER_20]: Our goal is to educate students.

1407
02:38:28,075 --> 02:38:33,758
[SPEAKER_20]: We need to have a consistent tool that we are monitoring their growth and their progress.

1408
02:38:34,138 --> 02:38:44,642
[SPEAKER_20]: If we don't have a consistent tool in place, then essentially I'm just making up what I'm saying to you and saying, let's wait until October to find out how we're doing.

1409
02:38:45,203 --> 02:38:49,404
[SPEAKER_20]: So I have, you know, I'm sorry you don't feel like the data

1410
02:38:51,065 --> 02:38:54,448
[SPEAKER_20]: is showing that we are making progress.

1411
02:38:54,468 --> 02:38:55,569
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't say that.

1412
02:38:55,909 --> 02:39:02,835
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to be clear that I'm not arguing against this assessment or arguing that the data doesn't show growth.

1413
02:39:03,336 --> 02:39:09,081
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm simply saying that those were not the questions that I asked in this resolution, that we asked in this resolution.

1414
02:39:09,730 --> 02:39:15,372
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm still feeling like the questions that I have, I still have them.

1415
02:39:15,772 --> 02:39:19,233
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still trying to understand how it's being used by teachers.

1416
02:39:19,553 --> 02:39:29,837
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to keep belaboring this, but I do want to be clear that I'm not against assessments if they are truly useful and if we find that the value-added

1417
02:39:31,508 --> 02:39:33,448
[SPEAKER_03]: evens out with the amount of time spent on it.

1418
02:39:33,548 --> 02:39:39,590
[SPEAKER_03]: And so maybe we need to talk about this more another time in terms of what information would help the school committee understand that better.

1419
02:39:39,910 --> 02:39:50,132
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I think some some assessments from the teachers, which I'm sure we can collect over the summer with a second follow up update sometime in the fall maybe would help be helpful.

1420
02:39:50,752 --> 02:39:51,272
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Graham.

1421
02:39:52,953 --> 02:39:53,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1422
02:39:53,313 --> 02:39:53,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Um,

1423
02:39:55,857 --> 02:40:12,744
[SPEAKER_04]: I am really excited about the data that this provides and the level of objectivity that it can deliver to the district as a whole because we have, as you say, we have lacked that ability.

1424
02:40:13,324 --> 02:40:20,807
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't think member Hays is suggesting that we didn't or that, you know, that the

1425
02:40:21,772 --> 02:40:23,593
[SPEAKER_04]: data isn't good or it is good.

1426
02:40:23,753 --> 02:40:27,095
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm supportive of an update next year as well.

1427
02:40:27,595 --> 02:40:36,340
[SPEAKER_04]: I think one of the questions that I have though is we've had a bunch of discussion about how this information is provided to parents.

1428
02:40:37,181 --> 02:40:46,646
[SPEAKER_04]: And as we end the year, report cards go out, there's map scores, there's standards,

1429
02:40:47,717 --> 02:40:51,338
[SPEAKER_04]: in the report cards that we're evaluating kids against?

1430
02:40:52,098 --> 02:40:54,558
[SPEAKER_04]: And what happens when those two things are in conflict?

1431
02:40:54,938 --> 02:41:03,160
[SPEAKER_04]: So, because at the end of the year, there's very little opportunity for parents to call the teacher and say, hey, what's going on here?

1432
02:41:04,220 --> 02:41:05,400
[SPEAKER_04]: This says everything's great.

1433
02:41:05,460 --> 02:41:07,141
[SPEAKER_04]: This course says everything's not great.

1434
02:41:07,181 --> 02:41:12,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Like what happens when there are those discrepancies as we like end the year essentially?

1435
02:41:12,942 --> 02:41:14,962
[SPEAKER_04]: And how's that information reflected to parents?

1436
02:41:19,309 --> 02:41:25,931
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I can speak to that a little bit for elementary, but I do want to just say that this is something that we're building.

1437
02:41:26,851 --> 02:41:38,315
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't think that this is a, uh, something that can happen overnight and especially rolling out this implementation during this still pandemic year, it was tricky.

1438
02:41:38,335 --> 02:41:43,216
[SPEAKER_13]: Like our assessment schedule was thrown off completely come January.

1439
02:41:43,720 --> 02:41:54,886
[SPEAKER_13]: when even the state moved the MCAS schedule, the access testing schedule, which then had to alter our MAPS testing schedule, which nobody, it's not ideal to be doing all of this in the month of June.

1440
02:41:55,306 --> 02:42:05,312
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think we still are gonna, it's gonna be a process to work out the best way to implement this and to work with the data.

1441
02:42:05,942 --> 02:42:19,671
[SPEAKER_13]: So, uh, Dr. Chiesa spoke about how the curriculum directors are working with this data at the secondary level and at the elementary level, the work that's in progress is using like the CPT times where principals work with grade level teams.

1442
02:42:20,711 --> 02:42:24,574
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, and that's something that will be like fully implemented next year.

1443
02:42:25,034 --> 02:42:32,599
[SPEAKER_13]: This year, there've been conversations with principals and grade level teams around the beginning phases of looking at this data.

1444
02:42:33,058 --> 02:42:49,285
[SPEAKER_13]: So there is so much data that's available for teachers to use on this platform that it's almost, it's a little daunting and very overwhelming for everyone to kind of navigate to decide which report is best to use.

1445
02:42:49,645 --> 02:42:56,888
[SPEAKER_13]: There are ones that will align as you are speaking, reports that align the standards to have a student's scores are.

1446
02:42:57,268 --> 02:43:00,690
[SPEAKER_13]: There are also quadrant reports that will show the teachers

1447
02:43:01,250 --> 02:43:14,119
[SPEAKER_13]: if they take their entire class, where the growth is in terms of students that are achieving high growth, high achievement, and then the students that may be showing growth, but their achievement is still below grade level.

1448
02:43:14,179 --> 02:43:21,124
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's multiple ways to use the data, and that's part of the conversations that are happening around common planning time.

1449
02:43:21,184 --> 02:43:30,110
[SPEAKER_13]: And so that way, if we're able to look across a grade level at where the students are achieving and where they need a little bit more support,

1450
02:43:30,549 --> 02:43:34,471
[SPEAKER_13]: then we're able to, teachers are able to add those supports in.

1451
02:43:34,671 --> 02:43:40,274
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, some of them are tier two, but a lot of them are tier one during that wind block time as well.

1452
02:43:40,755 --> 02:43:41,515
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if I was.

1453
02:43:43,016 --> 02:43:52,941
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the other question that I had was really just around like, what can parents expect in the envelope on the last day of school?

1454
02:43:54,062 --> 02:43:55,923
[SPEAKER_04]: And what happens when there's discrepancy?

1455
02:43:55,963 --> 02:43:59,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Like there's just not opportunity at that point for parents to,

1456
02:43:59,847 --> 02:44:04,069
[SPEAKER_04]: talk through those discrepancies because everyone has headed off for summer.

1457
02:44:04,649 --> 02:44:09,211
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have to assume there are kids where like there is discrepancy.

1458
02:44:09,251 --> 02:44:13,693
[SPEAKER_04]: They test well, they test badly versus like what the classroom teacher sees.

1459
02:44:13,753 --> 02:44:16,014
[SPEAKER_04]: How does that reconcile or does it yet?

1460
02:44:16,154 --> 02:44:21,676
[SPEAKER_13]: I still want to be very clear though, that this is one measurement tool understood in order to

1461
02:44:23,254 --> 02:44:51,401
[SPEAKER_13]: show student achievement one and it is an online assessment so for some students that might be a struggle in itself and one of the things that that I just thought of is we were talking about the testing and why it might take some students long because it is pushing the students and it is adapting to their ability they're unlike the MCAS students don't have the ability to skip if they're stuck on a question they don't have the ability to skip to the next question so some students

1462
02:44:52,042 --> 02:44:56,343
[SPEAKER_13]: if they're perfectionists at all, are going to get stuck on that one question, which will also increase the time.

1463
02:44:57,304 --> 02:45:03,085
[SPEAKER_13]: And so part of that is also teaching students how to tackle some of these things as they come along.

1464
02:45:03,626 --> 02:45:08,467
[SPEAKER_13]: So yes, there may be discrepancies when they get that family report at the end of the year.

1465
02:45:08,487 --> 02:45:16,309
[SPEAKER_13]: I always encourage the conversation, but I don't feel that necessarily.

1466
02:45:16,489 --> 02:45:21,291
[SPEAKER_13]: So two things, one part of this is with the testing coming out this late.

1467
02:45:22,357 --> 02:45:35,473
[SPEAKER_13]: It does hinder the conversations, which is something that we're going to adjust moving forward, but it doesn't mean that just because it's the last day of school conversations necessarily have to end if there are parents that have concerns they can reach out to the principal.

1468
02:45:37,717 --> 02:45:41,318
[SPEAKER_13]: are still accessible via email, they can reach out to me as well.

1469
02:45:42,278 --> 02:45:54,222
[SPEAKER_13]: But we're gonna be able to start the year with this data right here to inform our decisions and our instruction from the very beginning of the year.

1470
02:45:55,483 --> 02:46:03,185
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, I know I just said it, but I just have to stress that it's one form of data that we use to measure student achievement.

1471
02:46:04,600 --> 02:46:11,031
[SPEAKER_20]: I also just wanted to say to piggyback on Suzanne's comments, because this data rolls over.

1472
02:46:12,995 --> 02:46:16,942
[SPEAKER_20]: It's really going to put the teacher, the teacher is going to have a clear map of like

1473
02:46:18,325 --> 02:46:19,105
[SPEAKER_20]: What are your strengths?

1474
02:46:19,586 --> 02:46:20,466
[SPEAKER_20]: What are the areas?

1475
02:46:20,666 --> 02:46:22,647
[SPEAKER_20]: And then we're going to have the new baseline data.

1476
02:46:23,167 --> 02:46:36,713
[SPEAKER_20]: So the first time this assessment is given in the fall, they'll be able to look at June results, September, late September results, whenever we figure out when it's going to end, like cross map them.

1477
02:46:37,133 --> 02:46:40,815
[SPEAKER_20]: So students are actually going to be receiving more targeted support

1478
02:46:41,355 --> 02:46:48,642
[SPEAKER_20]: earlier on because we have a reliable norm referenced assessment that's gonna be able to help us.

1479
02:46:49,522 --> 02:46:57,889
[SPEAKER_20]: And so that's why I was saying that this tool, not only that we're using it, but many other districts are using it as well.

1480
02:46:58,370 --> 02:47:03,594
[SPEAKER_20]: So even if students transfer into Medford, if that data is available, we will have access to it.

1481
02:47:04,155 --> 02:47:07,237
[SPEAKER_20]: And I just feel like it's going to better position us

1482
02:47:08,338 --> 02:47:12,120
[SPEAKER_20]: I felt like our weak link was always our lack of data accessibility.

1483
02:47:12,640 --> 02:47:16,302
[SPEAKER_20]: And now we finally have access to in house data.

1484
02:47:16,982 --> 02:47:30,929
[SPEAKER_20]: And I do feel like this is going to be a game changer for how we provide supports justify, you know, oh we need additional interventionists or additional this.

1485
02:47:31,849 --> 02:47:33,290
[SPEAKER_20]: This is what our data is saying.

1486
02:47:33,551 --> 02:47:39,436
[SPEAKER_20]: This is how many students are impacted by it and truly make data informed decisions to improve the entire district.

1487
02:47:40,137 --> 02:47:42,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm excited for all of those possibilities.

1488
02:47:43,039 --> 02:47:49,405
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know that implementing something as significant as this takes time and years.

1489
02:47:50,137 --> 02:47:54,281
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're literally swimming in data right now.

1490
02:47:54,301 --> 02:47:56,923
[SPEAKER_04]: So I thank you for all the work that you're doing.

1491
02:47:56,963 --> 02:48:00,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you to the teachers who are taking this on in a really challenging year.

1492
02:48:00,907 --> 02:48:11,216
[SPEAKER_04]: The last thing I will say, though, is I do want the administration to be thinking about, is there something that we can take away so that we just aren't testing, testing, testing, testing, testing?

1493
02:48:11,976 --> 02:48:18,058
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know you all have done some of that work, but I think it bears repeating that we need to continue to do that work.

1494
02:48:18,158 --> 02:48:20,179
[SPEAKER_04]: If this is going to be our tool, I love it.

1495
02:48:20,699 --> 02:48:24,400
[SPEAKER_04]: If it can do everything we need it to do, that's even better.

1496
02:48:25,440 --> 02:48:34,163
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just want to make sure we're not adding this on top of, on top of, on top of, and making school about taking tests.

1497
02:48:35,063 --> 02:48:40,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I think there's a lot, the teachers have so much more to give than being test administrators.

1498
02:48:42,545 --> 02:48:46,566
[SPEAKER_16]: just from the secondary perspective, many, much of what Ms.

1499
02:48:46,606 --> 02:48:56,329
[SPEAKER_16]: Colucci said holds true for secondary, but also wanted to let any parents on the call know that they can reach out to the school principals and assistant principals over the summer.

1500
02:48:56,830 --> 02:49:04,592
[SPEAKER_16]: Also, the fall, once that test is administered in September, we're hoping to really shift the schedule so that we give an assessment

1501
02:49:05,412 --> 02:49:26,009
[SPEAKER_16]: in the first two weeks of September, one prior to the Christmas break, and then we're still trying to identify and thread the needle as to where it goes in the second half of the year so that it's actionable for MCAS as well as other supports to try to get students where they need to be prior to the end of the year so that they're on grade level moving forward.

1502
02:49:26,890 --> 02:49:32,234
[SPEAKER_16]: But that first assessment coupled with this June assessment, I think it's going to be really critical

1503
02:49:33,022 --> 02:49:44,144
[SPEAKER_16]: for families and for school personnel to reach out in a cross-communication manner, that if the school, if they don't hear from us, by all means, please reach out.

1504
02:49:44,284 --> 02:49:51,746
[SPEAKER_16]: And we can set up meetings, we can work with families to help understand the data and to really look at how we can best support their children.

1505
02:49:52,786 --> 02:49:53,466
[SPEAKER_17]: Great, thank you.

1506
02:49:53,486 --> 02:49:57,607
[SPEAKER_16]: The middle school has common planning time as well, and the team model

1507
02:49:58,240 --> 02:50:06,986
[SPEAKER_16]: is really an exceptionally effective way to support students who are locked into that middle school team with so many of our great middle school teachers.

1508
02:50:07,726 --> 02:50:08,046
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1509
02:50:08,066 --> 02:50:09,367
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

1510
02:50:09,607 --> 02:50:10,308
[SPEAKER_15]: Just one more question.

1511
02:50:10,328 --> 02:50:13,650
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Ruseau, and then we'll move on to number six.

1512
02:50:13,770 --> 02:50:14,270
[SPEAKER_19]: That'd be great.

1513
02:50:14,330 --> 02:50:14,971
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1514
02:50:15,491 --> 02:50:18,893
[SPEAKER_19]: Have we considered whether or not we can scrap kindergarten entirely?

1515
02:50:19,774 --> 02:50:23,536
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, I don't know, not kindergarten as in offering kindergarten.

1516
02:50:23,656 --> 02:50:25,277
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, testing in kindergarten.

1517
02:50:26,438 --> 02:50:27,599
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, I don't know how many more

1518
02:50:28,220 --> 02:50:34,003
[SPEAKER_19]: professional medical associations have to point out that kids shouldn't be sitting in front of a computer at all in kindergarten.

1519
02:50:34,964 --> 02:50:41,567
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm looking at our set, our report, I believe you, I can't remember who did it in May of 2019.

1520
02:50:41,727 --> 02:50:49,572
[SPEAKER_19]: We asked for an inventory of all assessments, which if you don't have it, I'll send it to you so you can maybe get it updated.

1521
02:50:51,235 --> 02:50:54,798
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, but there are a number of assessments for kindergartners.

1522
02:50:55,539 --> 02:51:04,747
[SPEAKER_19]: There's the DRA, there's the ELA formative assessments, the ELA summative assessments, and more.

1523
02:51:08,190 --> 02:51:09,871
[SPEAKER_13]: That's an old list, remember yourself.

1524
02:51:10,692 --> 02:51:11,132
[SPEAKER_19]: It's from 2019, I mean.

1525
02:51:13,380 --> 02:51:16,622
[SPEAKER_19]: It was probably the first and only list for all time before that.

1526
02:51:16,683 --> 02:51:17,743
[SPEAKER_19]: So good.

1527
02:51:17,803 --> 02:51:25,849
[SPEAKER_19]: So if you could get us an updated assessment list, that would be fabulous because to member Graham's point, like what can we scratch off this list?

1528
02:51:25,969 --> 02:51:33,174
[SPEAKER_19]: If for no other reason to give teachers more time to actually do instruction, which is allegedly why they do their jobs.

1529
02:51:34,495 --> 02:51:39,779
[SPEAKER_16]: I will say as a parent of a kindergartner who just finished an MBA map,

1530
02:51:40,845 --> 02:51:43,867
[SPEAKER_16]: I am eagerly awaiting that report.

1531
02:51:43,987 --> 02:51:47,110
[SPEAKER_16]: And while it is just one assessment, I agree with Ms.

1532
02:51:47,130 --> 02:51:48,391
[SPEAKER_16]: Galusi on that 100%.

1533
02:51:48,891 --> 02:51:54,475
[SPEAKER_16]: I am eagerly looking for that correlation to her report card as a parent.

1534
02:51:54,635 --> 02:52:03,542
[SPEAKER_16]: So I don't want to speak for any other parents, but as a kindergarten father, I'm eagerly awaiting that cross to see.

1535
02:52:03,882 --> 02:52:10,207
[SPEAKER_19]: But nobody in this room is young enough to have gone through kindergarten like we put kids through kindergarten now.

1536
02:52:13,273 --> 02:52:15,395
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's a terrible shame.

1537
02:52:16,515 --> 02:52:22,960
[SPEAKER_19]: And I don't really wanna be a participant in making kindergarten even more of college prep, which is what it is.

1538
02:52:24,861 --> 02:52:36,530
[SPEAKER_19]: So I just wanna make it clear that when I talk about getting rid of assessments, it's not because I don't think the teachers need to know where their kids are, but, you know,

1539
02:52:37,419 --> 02:52:45,746
[SPEAKER_19]: I, there was a recent thing about what you needed to know to go into first grade in the 70s and what you need to go into first grade now.

1540
02:52:46,666 --> 02:52:52,971
[SPEAKER_19]: And one looks like a college application and the other looks like you're just gonna go out and play in the sand.

1541
02:52:54,772 --> 02:52:55,873
[SPEAKER_19]: We all turned out okay.

1542
02:52:57,795 --> 02:52:58,855
[SPEAKER_19]: Most of us, some of us.

1543
02:53:00,997 --> 02:53:01,377
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1544
02:53:01,477 --> 02:53:02,398
[SPEAKER_13]: I will update that.

1545
02:53:02,578 --> 02:53:02,958
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1546
02:53:03,058 --> 02:53:03,459
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1547
02:53:05,774 --> 02:53:06,975
[SPEAKER_00]: Mayor, it's Dr. Chiesa.

1548
02:53:07,015 --> 02:53:08,775
[SPEAKER_00]: May I just add one thing about kindergarten?

1549
02:53:09,916 --> 02:53:11,096
[SPEAKER_15]: Dr. Chiesa and then we have Ms.

1550
02:53:11,136 --> 02:53:12,056
[SPEAKER_15]: Brito who would like to speak.

1551
02:53:12,157 --> 02:53:12,357
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1552
02:53:12,517 --> 02:53:13,197
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I apologize.

1553
02:53:13,257 --> 02:53:23,301
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to mention that the kindergarten NWEA map ELA also includes the dyslexia screener that we are mandated to do by law.

1554
02:53:23,881 --> 02:53:27,282
[SPEAKER_00]: So that one for kindergarten, we're not double testing.

1555
02:53:27,382 --> 02:53:33,805
[SPEAKER_00]: We are able to use NWEA to fulfill the requirements of dyslexia screener for kindergarten.

1556
02:53:35,916 --> 02:53:36,336
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Ms.

1557
02:53:36,376 --> 02:53:36,756
[SPEAKER_15]: Chiesa.

1558
02:53:37,977 --> 02:53:38,737
[SPEAKER_15]: Dr. Chiesa.

1559
02:53:40,058 --> 02:53:42,859
[SPEAKER_23]: Luisa Sprito, Ashland Street, Medford.

1560
02:53:45,341 --> 02:54:02,589
[SPEAKER_23]: I know this test isn't gonna go away, but I look at my colleagues, I look at the kindergarten teachers, and when it is time to administer MAPS, the anxiety in the teachers, not only the children, is just overwhelming.

1561
02:54:05,185 --> 02:54:26,472
[SPEAKER_23]: We have a great support system within the school that I'm in, I'm at the Roberts, and I'm sure the other schools are the same, but to just see the anxiety and the stress in those kindergarten teachers coming out of the classroom at lunchtime, and they're just like, you know, the kid wasn't able to do this.

1562
02:54:28,253 --> 02:54:34,195
[SPEAKER_23]: Is there any way to back off of the testing for, and just have it twice maybe for,

1563
02:54:35,458 --> 02:54:42,763
[SPEAKER_23]: kindergarten or have it, if it's twice now, maybe just go to the end of the year and just have them assess then.

1564
02:54:43,784 --> 02:54:48,347
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't think they have enough, uh, computer skills to begin with.

1565
02:54:49,828 --> 02:54:58,454
[SPEAKER_23]: I know that I'm extremely fortunate to be next door to miss Goldman who covered my class for several months last year while I had COVID.

1566
02:54:59,435 --> 02:55:04,038
[SPEAKER_23]: Um, because she, she has the technology skills.

1567
02:55:05,666 --> 02:55:10,190
[SPEAKER_23]: I still have to call her in my room when I was doing this map testing.

1568
02:55:11,511 --> 02:55:16,575
[SPEAKER_23]: One of my children that is dyslexic scored actually in the negative.

1569
02:55:18,036 --> 02:55:24,141
[SPEAKER_23]: And it broke my heart because this child's comprehension is just beyond anyone in the classes.

1570
02:55:24,822 --> 02:55:30,606
[SPEAKER_23]: The child is extremely bright, but this test does not show his full potential.

1571
02:55:32,428 --> 02:55:35,170
[SPEAKER_23]: I had to keep going around the classroom to

1572
02:55:36,348 --> 02:55:42,311
[SPEAKER_23]: remind children, click on the speaker so you can hear the directions.

1573
02:55:42,531 --> 02:55:44,272
[SPEAKER_23]: You don't always have to read the directions.

1574
02:55:45,373 --> 02:55:52,416
[SPEAKER_23]: So there's a lot, I think, that we can do to better this test if this is something that is going to stay.

1575
02:55:54,137 --> 02:56:01,321
[SPEAKER_23]: I do look forward to getting those scores next year, like you're saying, Superintendent, to work off of those, but

1576
02:56:02,924 --> 02:56:13,208
[SPEAKER_23]: I have children, I have two particular boys in my class that are exceptional in math and they scored so low in math.

1577
02:56:15,569 --> 02:56:30,416
[SPEAKER_23]: I have a child that has missed probably 40 days of school, has not even reached the benchmarks in reading, but yet scored super high.

1578
02:56:31,377 --> 02:56:37,779
[SPEAKER_23]: Some of these test scores, I don't think, are really indicative of their classroom performance.

1579
02:56:39,359 --> 02:56:44,041
[SPEAKER_23]: When I grade them for their report card, it will go by what they do with me.

1580
02:56:44,121 --> 02:56:46,862
[SPEAKER_23]: It will not go by any of the MAP scores.

1581
02:56:48,182 --> 02:56:55,504
[SPEAKER_23]: I know we have been told to use the MAP scores to grade their report cards, but I'm sorry, I can't do that.

1582
02:56:56,745 --> 02:56:57,525
[SPEAKER_23]: I cannot do that.

1583
02:56:57,705 --> 02:56:59,246
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't think it's fair to the child.

1584
02:57:01,718 --> 02:57:13,444
[SPEAKER_23]: their report card should be graded in accordance to what they've learned from me and not the mistakes that they've made on maps or the gains they've made on maps.

1585
02:57:14,604 --> 02:57:19,427
[SPEAKER_23]: But, you know, the first time I did test the children, I used the tool with Ms.

1586
02:57:19,447 --> 02:57:19,847
[SPEAKER_23]: Goldman.

1587
02:57:19,887 --> 02:57:22,328
[SPEAKER_23]: We were pilot teachers for the math program.

1588
02:57:24,669 --> 02:57:30,332
[SPEAKER_23]: And my class, the first map testing, my class scored higher than her class.

1589
02:57:31,178 --> 02:57:36,242
[SPEAKER_23]: And then we did the pilot and her class went slightly above in math.

1590
02:57:37,523 --> 02:57:42,988
[SPEAKER_23]: It was a good measure for that because with it, we did decide on the right program.

1591
02:57:43,068 --> 02:57:46,071
[SPEAKER_23]: The program I was using was hindering my students.

1592
02:57:46,111 --> 02:57:55,619
[SPEAKER_23]: So the thing is in the, not so much for math, but in the reading, I can tell where my students are.

1593
02:57:56,900 --> 02:57:57,480
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't need them.

1594
02:57:57,700 --> 02:57:59,282
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't need this test to tell me

1595
02:58:01,237 --> 02:58:19,303
[SPEAKER_23]: who's dyslexic, who's not, who is advanced, what child is gonna have trouble in the classroom, who needs to go to Title I. And the other thing is the children that come out identify that do need that RTI, can't get the RTI during when because they're already out with the Title I teacher.

1596
02:58:20,404 --> 02:58:28,867
[SPEAKER_23]: So there's kind of a catch there so that we have to do something with the scheduling as well so that we can find time to

1597
02:58:29,707 --> 02:58:31,748
[SPEAKER_23]: pull these other children to give me time.

1598
02:58:33,429 --> 02:58:42,094
[SPEAKER_23]: So I was kind of doing win this year from 8.30 to nine o'clock so I could get these children do that win before they would leave.

1599
02:58:42,715 --> 02:58:46,817
[SPEAKER_23]: Because I'm like, I need to see those kids that go out of the classroom.

1600
02:58:47,577 --> 02:58:52,420
[SPEAKER_23]: Those are the ones that are the most vulnerable.

1601
02:58:54,041 --> 02:58:59,084
[SPEAKER_23]: I just hope you just take it into consideration and you know,

1602
02:59:00,945 --> 02:59:05,408
[SPEAKER_23]: Sometimes you have to have maybe this for a couple of years and see how it works.

1603
02:59:05,508 --> 02:59:10,791
[SPEAKER_23]: And if there's no progress, then maybe we get rid of it then.

1604
02:59:10,811 --> 02:59:16,735
[SPEAKER_23]: But for now, I don't like administering it at all.

1605
02:59:17,376 --> 02:59:19,977
[SPEAKER_23]: The first time, it's awful.

1606
02:59:20,978 --> 02:59:23,199
[SPEAKER_23]: I could hear kids in the other first grades crying.

1607
02:59:23,700 --> 02:59:25,301
[SPEAKER_23]: My kids, I made like a game out of it.

1608
02:59:25,321 --> 02:59:26,802
[SPEAKER_23]: I just told, you know, how cool they are.

1609
02:59:26,822 --> 02:59:29,844
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, this is gonna be fun and all that.

1610
02:59:31,650 --> 02:59:34,893
[SPEAKER_23]: this last time I had children doing division in first grade.

1611
02:59:35,453 --> 02:59:38,856
[SPEAKER_23]: They didn't know what this, what is the squiggle thing?

1612
02:59:39,597 --> 02:59:40,758
[SPEAKER_23]: They had no idea what that was.

1613
02:59:41,618 --> 02:59:43,500
[SPEAKER_23]: What's quadrilateral.

1614
02:59:48,384 --> 02:59:50,846
[SPEAKER_23]: You could come in, Paul, I could have you take it.

1615
02:59:52,227 --> 02:59:53,769
[SPEAKER_23]: I'll pass, thank you.

1616
02:59:53,809 --> 02:59:54,609
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't embarrass us.

1617
02:59:56,112 --> 02:59:59,796
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Graham, thank you for coming forward, and we appreciate your feedback.

1618
02:59:59,836 --> 03:00:01,898
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if, Member Graham, I have a question for you, Ms.

1619
03:00:01,938 --> 03:00:02,278
[SPEAKER_15]: Brito.

1620
03:00:02,639 --> 03:00:08,345
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to say thank you for, A, it's 9.15, and you've been here since five, so.

1621
03:00:08,505 --> 03:00:10,287
[SPEAKER_04]: I live right here, two minutes away.

1622
03:00:10,687 --> 03:00:11,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for sticking with us.

1623
03:00:13,389 --> 03:00:15,451
[SPEAKER_23]: They were like bands playing in the house.

1624
03:00:17,231 --> 03:00:30,298
[SPEAKER_04]: But I would say, you know, some of your comments definitely like speak to the fact that this is a process that we're having to move through and that, you know, hopefully the superintendent and her team can can think about ways

1625
03:00:30,868 --> 03:00:40,933
[SPEAKER_04]: make the administration of this easier and it'll get easier each time for sure but are there other ways the district can provide support to make this easier?

1626
03:00:41,754 --> 03:00:51,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there more discussion that can happen as you guys sort of stop drowning in data and start swimming in it to say like what is the reconciliation of this data for particular kids

1627
03:00:51,719 --> 03:00:55,561
[SPEAKER_04]: where we're seeing something different in the classroom than the data is showing.

1628
03:00:55,601 --> 03:01:00,723
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's like when you talk about that whole child, like that's where the magic can start to happen.

1629
03:01:00,803 --> 03:01:07,606
[SPEAKER_04]: So I am hopeful that, you know, next year will be better than this year in all the ways.

1630
03:01:09,287 --> 03:01:10,688
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do think, you know,

1631
03:01:11,963 --> 03:01:20,133
[SPEAKER_04]: the administration needs to hear from you all about like what is working and what you need support on so that they can provide it so that this can get better.

1632
03:01:20,193 --> 03:01:22,776
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you for taking the time to do that tonight.

1633
03:01:22,816 --> 03:01:25,860
[SPEAKER_04]: It is appreciated and please keep the feedback coming.

1634
03:01:26,200 --> 03:01:26,380
[SPEAKER_22]: Yep.

1635
03:01:26,861 --> 03:01:27,201
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1636
03:01:27,382 --> 03:01:27,602
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1637
03:01:28,106 --> 03:01:28,526
[SPEAKER_22]: Remember Ms.

1638
03:01:28,546 --> 03:01:28,787
[SPEAKER_22]: Stone?

1639
03:01:29,007 --> 03:01:30,948
[SPEAKER_22]: I just have to say thank you that Ms.

1640
03:01:30,968 --> 03:01:34,731
[SPEAKER_22]: Frito taught four of our six kids for first grade and taught them all how to read.

1641
03:01:35,391 --> 03:01:39,774
[SPEAKER_22]: And I appreciate that foundation that she gave them all that they still talk about you.

1642
03:01:39,954 --> 03:01:40,275
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1643
03:01:40,415 --> 03:01:42,156
[SPEAKER_22]: So thank you for being there.

1644
03:01:43,317 --> 03:01:43,497
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

1645
03:01:43,517 --> 03:01:44,758
[SPEAKER_15]: Frito is my teacher.

1646
03:01:44,998 --> 03:01:45,878
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh my goodness.

1647
03:01:47,199 --> 03:01:48,120
[SPEAKER_15]: And then my sons.

1648
03:01:48,220 --> 03:01:50,702
[SPEAKER_15]: So she's been amazing for many years.

1649
03:01:50,722 --> 03:01:51,763
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm old.

1650
03:01:53,484 --> 03:01:54,324
[SPEAKER_23]: Be kind to me.

1651
03:01:54,665 --> 03:01:55,545
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1652
03:01:55,625 --> 03:01:55,905
[SPEAKER_15]: Good night.

1653
03:01:55,925 --> 03:01:56,286
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1654
03:01:56,306 --> 03:01:56,606
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1655
03:02:00,583 --> 03:02:00,763
[SPEAKER_15]: St.

1656
03:02:00,803 --> 03:02:01,243
[SPEAKER_15]: Joseph's.

1657
03:02:03,004 --> 03:02:03,184
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

1658
03:02:05,065 --> 03:02:05,225
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep.

1659
03:02:06,585 --> 03:02:07,245
[SPEAKER_15]: She was young.

1660
03:02:07,565 --> 03:02:09,286
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, still is.

1661
03:02:09,846 --> 03:02:10,206
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1662
03:02:10,366 --> 03:02:11,707
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for the update.

1663
03:02:11,747 --> 03:02:18,009
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we'll look for more updates in the fall and hopefully get more feedback from our teachers.

1664
03:02:18,849 --> 03:02:19,169
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1665
03:02:20,270 --> 03:02:27,232
[SPEAKER_15]: Number six, fiscal year 23, Metro Public School operating budget update, assistant superintendent of finance and operations, Mr. David Murphy.

1666
03:02:33,899 --> 03:02:34,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello again.

1667
03:02:34,339 --> 03:02:42,048
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to ask Dr. Cushing to put our deck from the budget hearing back up on the screen.

1668
03:02:42,068 --> 03:02:46,293
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll go through quickly as efficiently as we can.

1669
03:02:53,766 --> 03:02:55,167
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's going up on the screen.

1670
03:02:55,187 --> 03:03:09,912
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think at the hearing portion of the meeting, we sufficiently covered the budget process and a recap as to how we moved through over the course of the last six budget meetings and updates.

1671
03:03:11,155 --> 03:03:14,917
[SPEAKER_12]: You'll recall the two sort of overarching points that I made.

1672
03:03:15,337 --> 03:03:16,198
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

1673
03:03:17,058 --> 03:03:32,247
[SPEAKER_12]: With respect to the role of the school committee in the budgeting process and the strategy behind the district's decision to issue budget-related non-renewal notices in the coming days, given how tight the budget is anticipated to be in fiscal year 23.

1674
03:03:32,327 --> 03:03:37,410
[SPEAKER_12]: We can start rolling through if you don't mind.

1675
03:03:37,710 --> 03:03:40,011
[SPEAKER_12]: And then just a couple more.

1676
03:03:41,903 --> 03:03:47,808
[SPEAKER_12]: Great, and so the delta, or the original delta between the school committees, May 25th request.

1677
03:03:48,269 --> 03:03:48,549
[SPEAKER_12]: Louder.

1678
03:03:50,231 --> 03:03:52,192
[SPEAKER_12]: I was just being quiet based on everything I've already said.

1679
03:03:53,133 --> 03:03:55,956
[SPEAKER_12]: So I was gonna start speaking up when we get to the new stuff.

1680
03:03:56,597 --> 03:04:07,667
[SPEAKER_12]: The $4 million delta between the May 25th school committee request and how we've gone about both trying to preserve the strategic priorities to the degree possible within

1681
03:04:08,187 --> 03:04:13,808
[SPEAKER_12]: the anticipated operating budget and then some of the reconciliation processes that we've engaged in.

1682
03:04:13,868 --> 03:04:15,328
[SPEAKER_12]: So again, high level update.

1683
03:04:16,088 --> 03:04:18,149
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a level services budget by and large.

1684
03:04:18,509 --> 03:04:22,009
[SPEAKER_12]: It does include a 2% COLA that is budgeted in.

1685
03:04:22,590 --> 03:04:31,811
[SPEAKER_12]: The increases largely from the 67.4 that we're operating now to the 69 million we're anticipating to operate in FY23 is largely the fixed cost increases.

1686
03:04:32,611 --> 03:04:36,632
[SPEAKER_12]: And there will be the sort of strategy behind the reconciliations finding

1687
03:04:37,136 --> 03:04:39,077
[SPEAKER_12]: other funding sources wherever possible.

1688
03:04:39,778 --> 03:04:53,765
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we covered the position eliminations sufficiently, so I'm going to move past that slide, if I could, Dr. Cushing, and move to this table that shows how the two numbers came together.

1689
03:04:53,785 --> 03:04:54,826
[SPEAKER_12]: I think one more, if you could.

1690
03:04:57,918 --> 03:05:03,043
[SPEAKER_12]: So on the far left there, you see the $72.5 million request from May 25th.

1691
03:05:03,204 --> 03:05:08,930
[SPEAKER_12]: On the far right, the original anticipated appropriation for the municipal government of $68.5 million.

1692
03:05:09,270 --> 03:05:20,462
[SPEAKER_12]: I say original, the window of time between when that rose to approximately $69 million was so short we didn't even have a budget update in between there.

1693
03:05:21,504 --> 03:05:30,628
[SPEAKER_12]: You can see the various cuts and six bullet points at the bottom explaining how the administration has gone about attempting to reconcile these numbers.

1694
03:05:31,409 --> 03:05:40,773
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the one at the bottom there that there are some fiscal priorities that will be deferred to subsequent fiscal years as there is each budget year.

1695
03:05:43,755 --> 03:06:01,606
[SPEAKER_12]: So the next slide, I understand that given the size of that shortfall between the two original numbers, I recognize that the use of the term highlights could be one that could be met with some skeptical looks.

1696
03:06:01,666 --> 03:06:03,527
[SPEAKER_12]: I see that it is being met with some skeptical looks.

1697
03:06:04,268 --> 03:06:09,451
[SPEAKER_12]: At the same time, one of the points that the committee made at the beginning of this process is that

1698
03:06:09,929 --> 03:06:32,357
[SPEAKER_12]: The development of the district's operating budget is an opportunity for us to with a degree of transparency really demonstrate to the community that the inner workings of the district what our goals are and how we're attempting to pursue those and so understanding that very qualified definition of the term highlights here, I will say that one priority category a priority that was preserved it is.

1699
03:06:32,816 --> 03:06:47,950
[SPEAKER_12]: incorporated into this FY 23 budget based on other savings that we've been able to identify elsewhere with respect to grade strands that are not necessary due to grade strands unnecessary due to enrollment at a couple of schools.

1700
03:06:48,691 --> 03:06:57,960
[SPEAKER_12]: The additional 1.0 FTE of a special education teacher at the high school that will be there that will help us with our class ratios and making sure that

1701
03:06:58,679 --> 03:07:05,682
[SPEAKER_12]: We're providing a level of service to students that they are entitled to and to try to create the best possible learning environment.

1702
03:07:06,483 --> 03:07:13,486
[SPEAKER_12]: We've moved the two math coaches for the time being into the ESSER budget to make sure that we can capitalize on that curriculum investment.

1703
03:07:14,671 --> 03:07:20,713
[SPEAKER_12]: That's true for some of the other supports provided to high-need, most vulnerable populations.

1704
03:07:21,893 --> 03:07:42,378
[SPEAKER_12]: I mentioned earlier that one of the advantages, if we're going to call it that, is that this, to some degree, this budget will be a forcing mechanism for us to examine closely our fiscal priorities and what we are investing via our short-term funding capacity and through ESSERT grants and what we're investing through our operating budget.

1705
03:07:44,109 --> 03:07:49,491
[SPEAKER_12]: again, the COLA that we preserved despite the significant challenges that we're facing.

1706
03:07:50,371 --> 03:08:10,518
[SPEAKER_12]: With respect to the concerns or challenges that are represented by this budget, first and foremost, the scrubbing process that we've undertaken, particularly in the last two weeks, have put us in a position in which we have very little room to maneuver over the course of the next 12 months.

1707
03:08:11,796 --> 03:08:13,377
[SPEAKER_12]: possibly beyond.

1708
03:08:13,437 --> 03:08:26,926
[SPEAKER_12]: And so understanding that, well, over the course of the year, there are different points in time in which we can make strategic or difficult decisions to try to capture the resources necessary to make investments that we know will work for students.

1709
03:08:27,826 --> 03:08:34,230
[SPEAKER_12]: In this case, a lot of those decisions have now been made in order to get to the budget number that is before you tonight.

1710
03:08:34,250 --> 03:08:38,953
[SPEAKER_12]: And so that is just a reality that we will have to be cognizant of as we move through fiscal year 23.

1711
03:08:41,943 --> 03:08:45,586
[SPEAKER_12]: Beyond that, there are always unanticipated expenses.

1712
03:08:46,486 --> 03:08:56,914
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's not to say that in the court, in $69 million, there's always a few dollars that can be identified through some strategic thinking to be responsive to those types of anticipated concerns.

1713
03:08:57,875 --> 03:09:07,422
[SPEAKER_12]: But if we have major unanticipated financial challenges, then there will be different conversations that we'll have to have in this forum and others.

1714
03:09:09,524 --> 03:09:10,464
[SPEAKER_12]: So that is, that's a,

1715
03:09:11,755 --> 03:09:19,184
[SPEAKER_12]: A disclaimer that comes along with this budget proposal that there may be various things that we have to revisit over the course of the year.

1716
03:09:22,548 --> 03:09:24,391
[SPEAKER_12]: Just the last point with regard to stability.

1717
03:09:26,288 --> 03:09:31,634
[SPEAKER_12]: There will be positions that are eliminated over the course of the next week that are necessary to provide some degree of flexibility.

1718
03:09:32,915 --> 03:09:43,546
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, as I mentioned earlier, the June 15 statutory deadline necessitates some of those personnel decisions being made this week as opposed to in a few weeks, we will be working continuously

1719
03:09:43,886 --> 03:09:44,467
[SPEAKER_12]: immediately.

1720
03:09:44,547 --> 03:09:55,718
[SPEAKER_12]: We're already frankly working on the restoration of those positions, identifying other places in which we can identify savings that we don't have a statutory deadline attached to.

1721
03:09:56,759 --> 03:10:07,249
[SPEAKER_12]: But there are other things, the municipal budgeting process, the settlement of the collective bargaining agreements, and the identification of potentially the use of surplus FY22 funds

1722
03:10:08,926 --> 03:10:12,249
[SPEAKER_12]: to hopefully bring down some fixed costs in FY23.

1723
03:10:12,629 --> 03:10:22,977
[SPEAKER_12]: Those are essentially the three areas that can expedite or accelerate the restoration of positions that we have to eliminate over the course of the next week.

1724
03:10:24,378 --> 03:10:34,266
[SPEAKER_12]: I mention that because the obvious question when we issue budget-related non-renewal notices is if we're going to restore the positions, when can that happen?

1725
03:10:35,035 --> 03:10:55,012
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't have a specific date, but I can point to those three variables, what happens in the municipal budgeting process, the settlement, hopefully the settlement of CBAs, and the identification of what potential FY22 surplus funds can be used for in FY23, and there's a very limited

1726
03:10:56,656 --> 03:10:58,978
[SPEAKER_12]: category of things that we can use them for, but there are some.

1727
03:10:59,898 --> 03:11:09,685
[SPEAKER_12]: Those are the three areas that I think are our best path forward with respect to stabilizing the situation and having restorations as quickly as possible.

1728
03:11:13,068 --> 03:11:14,949
[SPEAKER_12]: We can probably skip over the next slide on the funding.

1729
03:11:15,319 --> 03:11:21,708
[SPEAKER_12]: the ESSER funding because we'll be sharing more information with you in the coming weeks on that, and we've already talked about it extensively.

1730
03:11:22,429 --> 03:11:29,598
[SPEAKER_12]: Just so with respect to next steps, we would ask for a vote this evening endorsing the $69 million budget.

1731
03:11:30,439 --> 03:11:34,001
[SPEAKER_12]: There isn't a good verb for me to use with respect to approval, endorsement.

1732
03:11:34,522 --> 03:11:39,325
[SPEAKER_12]: A vote will position us to have the conversations we need to with the city council in the coming weeks.

1733
03:11:40,946 --> 03:11:48,471
[SPEAKER_12]: We've received an initial invitation to testify before the council, and so I would anticipate the superintendent and myself doing that.

1734
03:11:49,371 --> 03:11:52,313
[SPEAKER_12]: If not this week, then within the next week or so.

1735
03:11:53,654 --> 03:11:56,356
[SPEAKER_12]: And then with regard to updates that you can anticipate,

1736
03:11:57,040 --> 03:11:57,621
[SPEAKER_12]: going forward.

1737
03:11:57,641 --> 03:12:05,386
[SPEAKER_12]: Obviously the collective bargaining processes and how those continue to make their way hopefully to a to a resolution in the near future.

1738
03:12:06,227 --> 03:12:10,650
[SPEAKER_12]: Specification with regard to the asset budget those 2 things are related as I mentioned earlier this evening.

1739
03:12:11,390 --> 03:12:23,319
[SPEAKER_12]: If in the event there is any supplemental funding opportunities will obviously let you know about that as quickly as possible and then we will also keep you posted with respect to any fluctuations with regard to FT ease.

1740
03:12:24,037 --> 03:12:27,059
[SPEAKER_12]: coming out of this week's budget-related non-renewal notices.

1741
03:12:28,500 --> 03:12:30,801
[SPEAKER_12]: With that, I'm happy to take your questions and would ask for your vote.

1742
03:12:31,802 --> 03:12:33,583
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Ruseau, then Member Graham.

1743
03:12:34,644 --> 03:12:35,024
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1744
03:12:35,084 --> 03:12:50,713
[SPEAKER_19]: First, I'd like to make a motion in compliance with rule number 76 to authorize the superintendent and assistant superintendent to attend City Council meetings for the purposes of delivering or answering questions related to the budget.

1745
03:12:51,274 --> 03:12:51,594
[SPEAKER_15]: Second.

1746
03:12:52,298 --> 03:12:55,961
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion for approval by members, so seconded by Member McLaughlin.

1747
03:12:56,221 --> 03:12:56,981
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

1748
03:12:57,001 --> 03:12:57,522
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

1749
03:12:57,762 --> 03:12:58,502
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

1750
03:12:58,603 --> 03:12:58,903
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion.

1751
03:12:59,323 --> 03:13:00,004
[SPEAKER_15]: Those opposed?

1752
03:13:00,504 --> 03:13:01,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

1753
03:13:07,589 --> 03:13:16,495
[SPEAKER_06]: As early as this Thursday, if... Member Graham.

1754
03:13:18,057 --> 03:13:18,437
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1755
03:13:18,457 --> 03:13:21,139
[SPEAKER_04]: I have been

1756
03:13:23,251 --> 03:13:28,374
[SPEAKER_04]: flashing back to two years ago when we had a very similar conversation about the budget.

1757
03:13:29,235 --> 03:13:41,922
[SPEAKER_04]: And at that time, we were not handling the process the way that we are now where we, we, the two things of what do we, what are we requesting and what are we

1758
03:13:43,556 --> 03:13:53,642
[SPEAKER_04]: dealing with in reality we're sort of mumbled together, and it made for a chaotic and confusing boat and lots of questions about what happens if we do or we don't approve.

1759
03:13:54,542 --> 03:14:01,526
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, sort of led to a series of questions that frankly still a little bit murky to me about what happens if the council does or doesn't approve.

1760
03:14:03,547 --> 03:14:25,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we, you know, so there's there's a lot of complexity and in the whole entire process but the one thing that I feel good about is that we have sort of bifurcated those two processes today so the community did hear from us, specifically, what we outlined as our strategic needs so that feels better than what we did two years ago.

1761
03:14:27,048 --> 03:14:32,789
[SPEAKER_04]: to provide an approval to this still doesn't sit totally right with me.

1762
03:14:32,849 --> 03:14:40,430
[SPEAKER_04]: So I did some thinking about like, what would it look like to approve such a budget?

1763
03:14:40,690 --> 03:14:48,892
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've come up with something that I think, at least for me, makes me feel okay about saying yes to this number that's bad.

1764
03:14:48,912 --> 03:14:55,733
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm gonna read it and hopefully somebody will like it enough to second it and then we can talk about it.

1765
03:14:57,067 --> 03:15:02,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee approves the fiscal year 2023 budget presented tonight.

1766
03:15:02,529 --> 03:15:14,033
[SPEAKER_04]: We approve the budget outlined at $68,994,776 and note that it is $2.8 million less than our request of $71.8 million to the mayor.

1767
03:15:14,833 --> 03:15:24,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it also resolved that the Medford School Committee expresses its sincere disappointment that we are faced with a budget shortfall in Medford public schools for the second time in just three years.

1768
03:15:25,014 --> 03:15:34,238
[SPEAKER_04]: The school committee commends the school administration for working in good faith on a budget that outlined our authentic needs in FY23 as our students continue to move on from a global pandemic.

1769
03:15:34,999 --> 03:15:46,424
[SPEAKER_04]: We especially thank our finance staff for their quick and unexpected work to make substantial cuts to the FY23 budget over this past week with limited impact on students and classrooms as possible.

1770
03:15:47,247 --> 03:15:55,617
[SPEAKER_04]: We had also resolved that it is the opinion of this committee that the actions taken to mitigate this budget shortfall are not sustainable going forward.

1771
03:15:55,977 --> 03:16:06,410
[SPEAKER_04]: We are calling on the mayor, the city of Medford, the Medford City Council and all residents of Medford to ensure that this is the last budget that cuts Medford public schools budget.

1772
03:16:07,833 --> 03:16:17,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Medford Public Schools represents the future of the city we call home, and we call on city leadership to provide the necessary funding to achieve our aspirations of being the best district we can possibly be.

1773
03:16:18,021 --> 03:16:28,609
[SPEAKER_04]: We implore city leadership to create all future budgets based on the recommendations of the Medford School Committee, where supporting students and investing in our infrastructure and teachers is the top priority.

1774
03:16:29,270 --> 03:16:34,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it further resolved that the full text of this motion and the corresponding vote be delivered by noon on Tuesday, June 14th,

1775
03:16:35,607 --> 03:16:38,930
[SPEAKER_04]: 2022 to the city clerk for distribution to the Medford City Council.

1776
03:16:40,191 --> 03:16:40,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

1777
03:16:41,332 --> 03:16:48,598
[SPEAKER_15]: If I may from the chair, just the language cuts Medford schools budget.

1778
03:16:49,359 --> 03:16:51,421
[SPEAKER_15]: I just don't think that's accurate.

1779
03:16:51,721 --> 03:16:55,144
[SPEAKER_15]: It's almost a two and a half percent increase from last year.

1780
03:16:55,564 --> 03:17:03,791
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, it's different than the requested amount the school committee sent to the administration, but in no way is that a cut.

1781
03:17:04,721 --> 03:17:06,162
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just can't, I can't approve that.

1782
03:17:06,442 --> 03:17:10,626
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't ask that respectfully ask that that language be taken out.

1783
03:17:11,186 --> 03:17:27,160
[SPEAKER_15]: You also mentioned a budget shortfall that that budget shortfalls based on over, you know, approximately $5 million over last year, whether or not I'm not going to get back into the override, but we have a limit on the tax levy of 2.5%.

1784
03:17:28,661 --> 03:17:32,104
[SPEAKER_15]: So for any department, whether it be school or

1785
03:17:32,523 --> 03:17:38,388
[SPEAKER_15]: fire or DPW to be asking for more than that is something that the city cannot afford and can't sustain.

1786
03:17:38,828 --> 03:17:42,952
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just ask that we reshape that a little bit.

1787
03:17:43,132 --> 03:17:49,537
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm okay with the rest of the language, but to say where it's a cut is inaccurate completely.

1788
03:17:52,079 --> 03:17:52,620
[SPEAKER_19]: Member Ruseau?

1789
03:17:54,602 --> 03:17:59,205
[SPEAKER_19]: When we went through our, I know it says five meetings, I think it was seven.

1790
03:18:01,555 --> 03:18:02,616
[SPEAKER_19]: seven budget meetings.

1791
03:18:04,499 --> 03:18:08,505
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, $71.1 million was a not cut number.

1792
03:18:09,266 --> 03:18:16,336
[SPEAKER_19]: Anything less than that was a cut between inflation and the increasing costs of buses and electricity and

1793
03:18:17,225 --> 03:18:19,647
[SPEAKER_19]: extra $200,000 for fuel.

1794
03:18:21,127 --> 03:18:29,273
[SPEAKER_19]: None of those things added a nickel of additional anything for a single student, a single staff member, no one.

1795
03:18:29,933 --> 03:18:38,879
[SPEAKER_19]: So regardless of the fact that it's 2.25 or 2.5% higher, it is absolutely a cut from a level service.

1796
03:18:39,439 --> 03:18:42,741
[SPEAKER_19]: Level service was 71.1 million, and I know those numbers are

1797
03:18:43,524 --> 03:18:48,866
[SPEAKER_19]: probably outdated and slightly off of it, but anything less than that is a cut.

1798
03:18:48,986 --> 03:18:57,390
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, if you go get service anywhere and they give you less service, that's a cut.

1799
03:18:58,730 --> 03:19:09,175
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think that while it is certainly a valid point that it is more dollars, it's also true that Medford's budget from, I think,

1800
03:19:10,296 --> 03:19:15,097
[SPEAKER_19]: a decade ago, adjusted for inflation, is barely what we have now.

1801
03:19:16,177 --> 03:19:23,379
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm not comfortable with changing the language, because in my mind, it is absolutely a cut.

1802
03:19:25,520 --> 03:19:25,760
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1803
03:19:25,800 --> 03:19:36,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin, I want to ask Mr. Murphy, I thought in the last slide presentation, when he was sharing the amount that was being asked, he was saying that was level funding.

1804
03:19:36,162 --> 03:19:38,623
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm confused about whether Mr. Murphy

1805
03:19:39,485 --> 03:19:43,307
[SPEAKER_05]: would see this as a cut or not, if you could help clarify that for us.

1806
03:19:43,447 --> 03:19:44,548
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, thank you, Ms.

1807
03:19:44,568 --> 03:19:44,928
[SPEAKER_12]: McLaughlin.

1808
03:19:44,968 --> 03:19:56,195
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's a little... One of the challenging things about this from the numbers perspective is that the original package that you approved was estimated to be 72.5.

1809
03:19:56,415 --> 03:20:01,118
[SPEAKER_12]: In the reconciliation memo, you saw that

1810
03:20:02,645 --> 03:20:09,168
[SPEAKER_12]: we were essentially preserving everything that was in the package that you approved at $71.8 million.

1811
03:20:09,208 --> 03:20:18,252
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, frankly, I did say when you approved the 72.5 that I anticipated that based on a few adjustments to the fixed cost estimates, we could bring that down.

1812
03:20:18,612 --> 03:20:30,738
[SPEAKER_12]: I was surprised that we brought it down $700,000, but I will be honest that there was a greater, and this is just very, I think this is just, this is a very transparent acknowledgement that

1813
03:20:31,639 --> 03:20:43,419
[SPEAKER_12]: the aggressiveness with which we were vetting the numbers increased when it became clear that the appropriation was going to be less than we had anticipated.

1814
03:20:43,959 --> 03:20:46,482
[SPEAKER_12]: And so exactly where is the fixed cost increase?

1815
03:20:46,943 --> 03:21:01,560
[SPEAKER_12]: It depends on how thoroughly did you want to vet the existing numbers and by not just in terms of adjusting them, but also some movement onto revolving funds.

1816
03:21:02,102 --> 03:21:21,774
[SPEAKER_12]: So essentially, the $71.8 billion number is the fixed cost increase after we engaged in some scrubbing of the budget that included some practices, like paying for recurring costs via revolving funds in a way that we had moved away from over the last two years.

1817
03:21:22,194 --> 03:21:26,957
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't really want to continue to do it, but it was clear that it was going to be necessary.

1818
03:21:27,418 --> 03:21:30,059
[SPEAKER_12]: And given the sort of short timeline,

1819
03:21:31,440 --> 03:21:38,044
[SPEAKER_12]: there was a need to start to get that number in which the 69 was to some degree in sight.

1820
03:21:38,724 --> 03:21:41,686
[SPEAKER_12]: So what exactly is the fixed cost increase?

1821
03:21:41,786 --> 03:21:45,368
[SPEAKER_12]: It's about $2.3 million or so, I would say, maybe 2.2.

1822
03:21:45,708 --> 03:21:52,092
[SPEAKER_12]: But I mentioned earlier that one of the ways in which we can continue to realize some flexibility

1823
03:21:53,590 --> 03:22:01,192
[SPEAKER_12]: is we can look at potential surplus FY22 funds and advance pay some of the tuitions due in FY23.

1824
03:22:01,232 --> 03:22:07,214
[SPEAKER_12]: That will lower the fixed cost increase and therefore change the number that I'm referring to now.

1825
03:22:08,754 --> 03:22:18,417
[SPEAKER_12]: But it also, it does, there's a little bit of can kicking that goes on with that because those fixed costs are gonna continue to increase in subsequent fiscal years.

1826
03:22:19,451 --> 03:22:29,380
[SPEAKER_12]: My recommendation would be to say, add the language to the request, which is what the mayor's point is this is not a cut to the operating budget, which it is not.

1827
03:22:29,941 --> 03:22:32,663
[SPEAKER_12]: It is a adjustment to what you requested.

1828
03:22:33,164 --> 03:22:34,385
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think adding that language.

1829
03:22:34,665 --> 03:22:41,571
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not maybe I don't know if the word cut is the problem that maybe it's adjustment or modify or something along those lines.

1830
03:22:46,029 --> 03:22:50,291
[SPEAKER_19]: In 2020, we had exactly the same number of dollars as we did in the previous year.

1831
03:22:50,311 --> 03:22:51,411
[SPEAKER_19]: Would you have called that a cut?

1832
03:22:53,332 --> 03:22:58,114
[SPEAKER_12]: If you had exactly the same number of dollars, meaning not accounting for any fixed cost increases?

1833
03:22:58,614 --> 03:23:04,977
[SPEAKER_19]: We were level funded for 2020 and we laid off, I don't know the number anymore.

1834
03:23:05,017 --> 03:23:06,317
[SPEAKER_19]: It's changed.

1835
03:23:06,597 --> 03:23:07,858
[SPEAKER_12]: It was over a hundred, which is.

1836
03:23:08,198 --> 03:23:09,179
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

1837
03:23:09,479 --> 03:23:10,779
[SPEAKER_19]: But we didn't call them all back.

1838
03:23:11,419 --> 03:23:15,241
[SPEAKER_19]: So for those staff members that didn't get called back,

1839
03:23:16,526 --> 03:23:29,181
[SPEAKER_19]: I would suggest that they didn't see their job loss as not a cut, so a cut is it there's there's no world where a cut only means going from $100 to 99.

1840
03:23:32,768 --> 03:23:39,555
[SPEAKER_12]: So the thing is, I don't really want to weigh in too heavily on the committee's, uh, you know, choice of emotion.

1841
03:23:39,575 --> 03:23:55,050
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think that's my place to, but the only thing I would say is that when we present on, and when we share this information, um, I think it's important to remember that there are a number of constituencies that are following along with very different perspectives.

1842
03:23:55,451 --> 03:23:56,672
[SPEAKER_12]: And there are some who would say,

1843
03:23:57,112 --> 03:24:06,957
[SPEAKER_12]: that if a number that it is only cut if the number is reduced and it's not if the number goes from x to x plus I think that I do think that that constituency is out there.

1844
03:24:07,437 --> 03:24:09,578
[SPEAKER_12]: I also think, and this is the last thing I'll say about this.

1845
03:24:10,248 --> 03:24:28,857
[SPEAKER_12]: It is a constituency that if the position is going to be that the school committee's request should be funded with 100%, I will say as the CFO of the district, I would expect the community to expect us to have a substantial degree of scrutiny over our budgeting process.

1846
03:24:29,397 --> 03:24:32,159
[SPEAKER_12]: And frankly, that is something that we try to employ.

1847
03:24:35,181 --> 03:24:43,216
[SPEAKER_12]: 67.4 or 69 or $71.8 million in an organization that is this complex with this many variables changing on a day to day basis.

1848
03:24:43,632 --> 03:24:48,716
[SPEAKER_12]: with the needs of students evolving as rapidly as they sometimes do, it's not easy.

1849
03:24:49,256 --> 03:25:00,565
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think it's important to always keep in mind that perspective of, and I know we spoke to this on May 25th as well, but there's perspective of the community member who is not a direct stakeholder in the schools.

1850
03:25:00,945 --> 03:25:05,949
[SPEAKER_12]: We need that person to be as invested in the school system as those of you who are directly connected.

1851
03:25:06,969 --> 03:25:17,214
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think the only way that we earn the trust, the confidence, the goodwill of those members of the community is if we are providing that level of scrutiny.

1852
03:25:17,254 --> 03:25:26,799
[SPEAKER_12]: And so again, it's really not my place to say how you should word the motion, other than to say, I think that from my time here, all of you

1853
03:25:27,478 --> 03:25:38,181
[SPEAKER_12]: on the committee and in the municipal government are trying to prioritize the students and children of this community and trying to maximize that investment.

1854
03:25:38,281 --> 03:25:41,981
[SPEAKER_12]: I think there's disagreement and honest disagreement about how to do that.

1855
03:25:43,142 --> 03:25:48,583
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that the message should articulate that shared commitment.

1856
03:26:15,466 --> 03:26:16,807
[SPEAKER_15]: We are not cutting the budget.

1857
03:26:16,847 --> 03:26:18,948
[SPEAKER_15]: I've worked very hard over the last two weeks.

1858
03:26:19,028 --> 03:26:19,808
[SPEAKER_15]: I wish it was sooner.

1859
03:26:19,828 --> 03:26:29,194
[SPEAKER_15]: I wish it was a month ago that we had the news, but we worked very hard on the city side to level fund as much as possible so that we could add to the school budget.

1860
03:26:30,162 --> 03:26:31,223
[SPEAKER_15]: We're not where we want to be.

1861
03:26:31,343 --> 03:26:32,203
[SPEAKER_15]: Nobody's happy.

1862
03:26:32,223 --> 03:26:36,786
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think anybody in the whole community is happy, but we are budgeting.

1863
03:26:36,966 --> 03:26:38,187
[SPEAKER_15]: We are doing what we have to do.

1864
03:26:38,307 --> 03:26:44,231
[SPEAKER_15]: And there is a 2.5% increase approximately to the MedFed's public school budget.

1865
03:26:44,951 --> 03:26:52,796
[SPEAKER_15]: So I respectfully ask that somebody propose that that motion be amended to remove the word cut.

1866
03:26:53,837 --> 03:26:54,137
[SPEAKER_24]: Mayor.

1867
03:26:55,378 --> 03:26:55,918
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Grimf.

1868
03:26:56,135 --> 03:27:02,219
[SPEAKER_04]: there are two places where the word cut appears in the budget, in this motion.

1869
03:27:02,679 --> 03:27:16,668
[SPEAKER_04]: The first says, we especially thank our finance staff for their quick and unexpected work to make substantial cuts to the FY23 budget over the past week with as limited an impact on students and classrooms as possible.

1870
03:27:17,388 --> 03:27:20,230
[SPEAKER_04]: What I would propose, what I'm happy to amend is that

1871
03:27:20,974 --> 03:27:31,057
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, the unexpected work to make substantial cuts to the planned FY 23 budget, um, over the last week with as limited an impact as possible.

1872
03:27:31,137 --> 03:27:36,479
[SPEAKER_04]: So we did cut our plan unexpectedly.

1873
03:27:36,819 --> 03:27:37,460
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a fact.

1874
03:27:37,840 --> 03:27:40,340
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is one place where the word cut occurs.

1875
03:27:40,420 --> 03:27:44,162
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would be happy to add the word planned, um, to the motion.

1876
03:27:44,602 --> 03:27:47,903
[SPEAKER_04]: And I feel like that doesn't degrade the intent.

1877
03:27:48,680 --> 03:28:06,090
[SPEAKER_04]: The second place where cut appears, it says, we are calling on the mayor, the city of Medford and the Medford city council and all residents, all Medford residents to ensure that this is the last budget that cuts Medford public schools.

1878
03:28:08,471 --> 03:28:15,715
[SPEAKER_04]: What I would be happy to do is say that this is the last budget that requires a reduction in services

1879
03:28:17,571 --> 03:28:18,711
[SPEAKER_07]: from Medford Public Schools.

1880
03:28:22,192 --> 03:28:23,473
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm comfortable with those changes.

1881
03:28:24,233 --> 03:28:24,933
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll second that.

1882
03:28:32,155 --> 03:28:34,656
[SPEAKER_05]: So can you repeat the two changes to the word cut?

1883
03:28:34,716 --> 03:28:40,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I heard that the first one was the plan, but the finance director for working to

1884
03:28:41,513 --> 03:28:43,174
[SPEAKER_05]: cut from the plan, which was the original 71.

1885
03:28:43,714 --> 03:28:48,636
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, the original 70 to the 71.

1886
03:28:49,637 --> 03:28:54,859
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the second one was that we, that this cut services.

1887
03:28:54,899 --> 03:28:55,079
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1888
03:28:55,279 --> 03:28:55,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1889
03:28:55,579 --> 03:29:11,046
[SPEAKER_04]: That this is the two that we're calling on the mayor, the city of Medford, the Medford city council and all Medford residents to ensure that this is the last budget that requires cuts in, sorry, reductions in service to Medford public schools.

1890
03:29:11,550 --> 03:29:12,831
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, reductions, uh-huh.

1891
03:29:15,494 --> 03:29:21,118
[SPEAKER_12]: Your microphone.

1892
03:29:21,879 --> 03:29:27,124
[SPEAKER_12]: It is true that there's been a scramble to make revisions over the course of the last couple of weeks.

1893
03:29:27,764 --> 03:29:30,206
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not exclusively cuts, which I know you know.

1894
03:29:30,226 --> 03:29:38,654
[SPEAKER_12]: There's been a lot of shifting in the identification of resources for purposes of preserving the level of services.

1895
03:29:39,093 --> 03:30:03,513
[SPEAKER_12]: And so it might be worth considering something to the effect of the reduction in something to services supported by the operating budget, which I think to the mayor's point about wanting to make sure that everyone in the community understands that we're still to the best of our ability providing services and support.

1896
03:30:03,893 --> 03:30:06,776
[SPEAKER_12]: We are doing that, we're doing it through more creative financial means.

1897
03:30:07,376 --> 03:30:17,059
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know to my friend I was referring to earlier, the person without a direct stake in the schools, the question would then become, well, why aren't you using those creative financial means to begin with?

1898
03:30:17,859 --> 03:30:28,163
[SPEAKER_12]: And the answer to that is there are sustainability issues when it comes to the use of one-time funds and with regard to the predictability of revolving funds.

1899
03:30:28,223 --> 03:30:35,485
[SPEAKER_12]: And so it's a practice that we were able to move away from to a large degree over the last two years, and we're needing to now resort to

1900
03:30:36,587 --> 03:30:37,888
[SPEAKER_12]: based on the capacity issues.

1901
03:30:37,928 --> 03:30:52,356
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think it is most accurate to say that the level of services that are supported by the operating budget is what needed to be adjusted.

1902
03:30:52,616 --> 03:30:54,297
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're doing our best, frankly.

1903
03:30:55,223 --> 03:31:01,009
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know that I would agree that the actual outcome of this process is going to be a reduction in services.

1904
03:31:02,290 --> 03:31:09,798
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to be a reduction or a modification to how those services are being funded.

1905
03:31:10,785 --> 03:31:12,826
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and I think that's a fair point.

1906
03:31:12,986 --> 03:31:19,967
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would also be happy to amend that to say reduction in services supported by the operating budget.

1907
03:31:21,648 --> 03:31:29,529
[SPEAKER_04]: For anybody who's actually still with us, that's really important because it is not recommended best practice.

1908
03:31:30,290 --> 03:31:31,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Revolving accounts revolve.

1909
03:31:32,170 --> 03:31:33,130
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not always there.

1910
03:31:33,230 --> 03:31:34,291
[SPEAKER_04]: We cannot rely on them.

1911
03:31:34,611 --> 03:31:35,351
[SPEAKER_04]: ESSER will go

1912
03:31:36,801 --> 03:31:41,986
[SPEAKER_04]: way of the wind within a few short years, maybe sooner, given how heavily we're going to rely on it.

1913
03:31:42,526 --> 03:31:50,293
[SPEAKER_04]: So we are, in a sense, kicking the can a little bit down the road here.

1914
03:31:50,673 --> 03:31:53,276
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's really, you know, people will forget that.

1915
03:31:54,036 --> 03:31:58,000
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the work that we've done is commendable, because we're not

1916
03:31:58,567 --> 03:32:12,174
[SPEAKER_04]: cutting services in drastic fashion in totality, but instead we are saying our operating budget cannot support the level of service that we feel we need to provide.

1917
03:32:12,714 --> 03:32:17,396
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're lucky right now that we have an alternative and that will not be the case always.

1918
03:32:19,197 --> 03:32:20,018
[SPEAKER_15]: Member McLaughlin.

1919
03:32:20,458 --> 03:32:20,798
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1920
03:32:21,859 --> 03:32:26,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I think that what I'm hearing is both and and not

1921
03:32:27,775 --> 03:32:32,538
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that for folks that may still be here, or that will watch this later.

1922
03:32:32,558 --> 03:32:43,725
[SPEAKER_05]: I think so much of this conversation can be frankly confusing, especially for the layperson, and a lot of it feels like, and some is frankly potato potato.

1923
03:32:44,666 --> 03:32:47,147
[SPEAKER_05]: And some is kicking the can and some is a number of things.

1924
03:32:47,207 --> 03:33:07,715
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you think about, if I think about the lay person and getting back to knocking on doors and people talking about budgets and what have you, as we were knocking on doors, for a person who's not necessarily invested in the schools or what have you, if they hear when we're knocking doors that we went from 67 million to 69 million, 2.5, less than $2.5 million increase in dollars for them.

1925
03:33:13,757 --> 03:33:24,362
[SPEAKER_05]: they're not going to stand by and have a 45-minute conversation with us about what the level services were, what the difference in services were, how this worked and how that worked.

1926
03:33:24,442 --> 03:33:34,007
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I think that I appreciate through the chair, member Graham's willingness to be more flexible in the language and the way that this is written.

1927
03:33:34,047 --> 03:33:35,248
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's also true as

1928
03:33:36,008 --> 03:33:52,429
[SPEAKER_05]: We recall from two years ago, when we, when there was some consternation over whether or not to approve the budget and what it meant if we approved or didn't approved and whether people would get paid July 1 if we didn't approve and all those other things that were sort of blowing up at the time I want to point that back to people as well that.

1929
03:33:54,468 --> 03:33:56,489
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, we are all doing the best that we can here.

1930
03:33:57,109 --> 03:34:01,691
[SPEAKER_05]: And I do appreciate all the work that you've done to try to, to try to help us with these numbers.

1931
03:34:02,311 --> 03:34:09,113
[SPEAKER_05]: And I hope that the constituency also understands that this has been a really difficult time, both with COVID and with everything else.

1932
03:34:09,173 --> 03:34:11,414
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're doing the best we can with the budgets.

1933
03:34:11,454 --> 03:34:16,776
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that our students will get what they need because that's what our staff does.

1934
03:34:17,056 --> 03:34:17,636
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you.

1935
03:34:19,677 --> 03:34:22,798
[SPEAKER_15]: We could just read the full resolution one more time, please.

1936
03:34:23,942 --> 03:34:29,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, be it resolved that the Medford school committee approves the fiscal year 2023 budget presented tonight.

1937
03:34:30,229 --> 03:34:33,733
[SPEAKER_04]: We approve the budget outlined at $68,994,776, and note that it is $2.8 million less than our request of $71.8 million to the mayor.

1938
03:34:42,623 --> 03:34:52,548
[SPEAKER_04]: We had also resolved that the Medford School Committee expresses its sincere disappointment that we are faced with a budget shortfall in Medford public schools for the second time in just three years.

1939
03:34:53,269 --> 03:35:03,234
[SPEAKER_04]: The school committee commends the school administration for working in good faith on a budget that outlined our authentic needs in FY23 as our students continue to move on from a global pandemic.

1940
03:35:03,675 --> 03:35:08,077
[SPEAKER_04]: We especially thank our finance staff for their quick and unexpected work to make

1941
03:35:08,709 --> 03:35:16,677
[SPEAKER_04]: substantial cuts to the planned FY 23 budget over the last week with as limited an impact on students and classrooms as possible.

1942
03:35:17,258 --> 03:35:25,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it also resolved that it is the opinion of this committee that the actions taken to mitigate this budget shortfall are not sustainable going forward.

1943
03:35:25,506 --> 03:35:27,809
[SPEAKER_04]: We are calling on the mayor, the city of Medford,

1944
03:35:28,109 --> 03:35:38,192
[SPEAKER_04]: the Medford City Council and all Medford residents to ensure that this is the last budget that requires reduction in services supported by the operating budget of Medford Public Schools.

1945
03:35:38,973 --> 03:35:51,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Medford Public Schools represents the future of the city we call home, and we call on city leadership to provide the necessary funding to achieve our aspirations of being the best district we can possibly be.

1946
03:35:52,057 --> 03:35:57,339
[SPEAKER_04]: We implore city leadership to create all future budgets based on the recommendations of the Medford School Committee,

1947
03:35:57,853 --> 03:36:02,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Supporting students and investing in our infrastructure and teachers is the top priority of this committee.

1948
03:36:03,056 --> 03:36:12,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it further resolved that the full text of this motion and the corresponding vote will be delivered by noon on Tuesday, June 14th, 2022 to the city clerk for distribution to the Medford City Council.

1949
03:36:15,022 --> 03:36:15,442
[SPEAKER_18]: Ready to vote?

1950
03:36:15,742 --> 03:36:22,266
[SPEAKER_15]: I would just ask that we stay consistent with the word request and change the word planned to requested.

1951
03:36:23,446 --> 03:36:25,247
[SPEAKER_15]: And that it's consistent on those two spots.

1952
03:36:28,854 --> 03:36:29,234
[SPEAKER_07]: That's fine.

1953
03:36:29,674 --> 03:36:29,834
Yeah.

1954
03:36:30,555 --> 03:36:31,795
[SPEAKER_12]: Can I just add one thing?

1955
03:36:32,115 --> 03:36:32,335
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Murphy?

1956
03:36:32,916 --> 03:36:39,578
[SPEAKER_12]: If in the first cuts, if we could say cuts and modifications, the superintendent and I will be testifying along.

1957
03:36:40,699 --> 03:36:48,161
[SPEAKER_12]: There are some, I suspect, that have only made cuts because they don't have some of these other funding avenues available to them.

1958
03:36:48,762 --> 03:36:57,565
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think for purposes of, I think strategically, I think it would be advantageous to acknowledge cuts and modifications.

1959
03:36:58,581 --> 03:36:58,941
[SPEAKER_07]: That's fair.

1960
03:37:06,463 --> 03:37:10,324
[SPEAKER_07]: So as amended, so instead of planned, it was, it was say requested.

1961
03:37:10,344 --> 03:37:10,404
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

1962
03:37:17,865 --> 03:37:21,466
[SPEAKER_15]: Like the language in front of me, I, it names me multiple times and I

1963
03:37:22,864 --> 03:37:23,244
[SPEAKER_15]: Would you say?

1964
03:37:23,785 --> 03:37:24,746
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't have a copy.

1965
03:37:24,966 --> 03:37:25,786
[SPEAKER_15]: Jenny just wrote it.

1966
03:37:25,846 --> 03:37:41,499
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm deciding if I should abstain from voting because I think it's great that we do have a budget based on need, but to ask for the administration, which I like serving on the school committee.

1967
03:37:41,519 --> 03:37:51,808
[SPEAKER_15]: I like knowing what's going on in my, you know, the student school, but to have a budget based on need and, you know, somewhat hopes and,

1968
03:37:52,622 --> 03:37:59,649
[SPEAKER_15]: things we'd love to see and be the only one that has to worry about the full fiscal picture of the city.

1969
03:38:00,209 --> 03:38:04,874
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a little difficult for me on my end.

1970
03:38:07,816 --> 03:38:09,578
[SPEAKER_04]: And Mayor, I fully respect that.

1971
03:38:09,718 --> 03:38:11,900
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand that you are uniquely in a position.

1972
03:38:11,920 --> 03:38:17,866
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not sure when you wrote that you respected that at all to say cuts and, you know, last week was torturous.

1973
03:38:18,410 --> 03:38:25,194
[SPEAKER_15]: but I stayed quiet because I respect the committee and I don't want to go back and forth and argue all night long.

1974
03:38:25,734 --> 03:38:27,575
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to show the community that we have.

1975
03:38:27,635 --> 03:38:31,337
[SPEAKER_15]: We've done a lot of hard work over the last year, two years.

1976
03:38:31,417 --> 03:38:40,282
[SPEAKER_15]: You're one of the hardest, you know, you're some of the hardest working people I do know, but the level of respect, I just, with that resolution, I don't know.

1977
03:38:40,442 --> 03:38:47,366
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't, I just don't see it, but I'd like it before me before I could officially vote on it.

1978
03:38:47,981 --> 03:38:48,881
[SPEAKER_19]: You want to read it one more time?

1979
03:38:48,901 --> 03:38:50,662
[SPEAKER_15]: If you want me to abstain, I'll abstain.

1980
03:38:51,602 --> 03:38:56,284
[SPEAKER_15]: What's to say next year you won't ask for $95 million and then say I'm cutting the budget by $20 million.

1981
03:38:57,184 --> 03:39:07,328
[SPEAKER_15]: I have no control what the committee will do, but I do have to control keeping the city and the schools within the means of the revenue that comes in based on taxes.

1982
03:39:07,648 --> 03:39:09,568
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's a difficult job.

1983
03:39:09,628 --> 03:39:10,869
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not easy for any of us.

1984
03:39:15,913 --> 03:39:21,738
[SPEAKER_22]: It appears that all of us are hearing it for the first time, except for member Graham and possible member Rousseau.

1985
03:39:21,778 --> 03:39:24,460
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, so I don't feel comfortable voting on the motion.

1986
03:39:24,560 --> 03:39:26,122
[SPEAKER_22]: I thought we were just voting on the budget tonight.

1987
03:39:26,262 --> 03:39:27,463
[SPEAKER_22]: That's what I would like to vote on.

1988
03:39:28,464 --> 03:39:30,425
[SPEAKER_22]: If you want to put that forth as yourself.

1989
03:39:30,566 --> 03:39:31,847
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a motion to table.

1990
03:39:31,867 --> 03:39:33,948
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion to table the motion as undebatable.

1991
03:39:34,008 --> 03:39:34,429
[SPEAKER_19]: Is there a second?

1992
03:39:34,569 --> 03:39:35,350
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion to table.

1993
03:39:35,470 --> 03:39:37,271
[SPEAKER_19]: Point of order, that is not allowed.

1994
03:39:37,371 --> 03:39:38,993
[SPEAKER_19]: It was motioned and seconded.

1995
03:39:39,273 --> 03:39:40,374
[SPEAKER_19]: You cannot table it now.

1996
03:39:41,601 --> 03:39:43,042
[SPEAKER_19]: It was already motioned and seconded.

1997
03:39:43,202 --> 03:39:44,962
[SPEAKER_19]: It can only be withdrawn or voted.

1998
03:39:45,362 --> 03:39:46,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, then we can vote.

1999
03:39:46,443 --> 03:39:50,104
[SPEAKER_05]: But I can, may I also make a point of, I guess, information?

2000
03:39:50,204 --> 03:39:57,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we also had voted in the past, just making a point, that the meetings were not gonna go over 9.30.

2001
03:39:58,508 --> 03:40:05,230
[SPEAKER_05]: So if they're going over 9.30, we're supposed to make a motion that we're gonna be willing to go over 9.30 to X amount of time.

2002
03:40:05,310 --> 03:40:09,612
[SPEAKER_05]: If I remember correctly, I know it was member Kreatz's motion, so she might recall.

2003
03:40:11,786 --> 03:40:12,986
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have it in front of me.

2004
03:40:13,527 --> 03:40:14,267
[SPEAKER_19]: I do, one second.

2005
03:40:16,228 --> 03:40:20,369
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to extend the meeting for another 30 minutes.

2006
03:40:21,530 --> 03:40:24,451
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to extend the meeting for another 15 minutes.

2007
03:40:24,491 --> 03:40:25,391
[SPEAKER_15]: Not 10 minutes.

2008
03:40:25,852 --> 03:40:30,213
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, 15 minutes by Member Kress, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

2009
03:40:30,553 --> 03:40:31,294
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

2010
03:40:31,674 --> 03:40:31,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

2011
03:40:31,974 --> 03:40:32,694
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

2012

[SPEAKER_15]: Meeting's gonna go till 10.10.

2013
03:40:35,615 --> 03:40:39,277
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's a motion on the floor that you'd like to be heard.

2014
03:40:41,860 --> 03:40:42,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Roll call, please.

03:40:46,021 --> 03:40:46,281

[SPEAKER_18]: Member Kreatz.

2019
03:40:52,622 --> 03:40:53,683
[SPEAKER_10]: What are we voting on again?

2020
03:40:53,843 --> 03:40:54,603
[SPEAKER_10]: On Jenny's motion.

2021
03:40:56,663 --> 03:40:59,224
[SPEAKER_10]: And is this the final vote to send the budget?

2022
03:40:59,404 --> 03:41:02,525
[SPEAKER_15]: No, this is whether or not you want the motion to be part of the record.

2023
03:41:03,265 --> 03:41:03,725
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

2024
03:41:04,349 --> 03:41:04,709

2026
03:41:09,252 --> 03:41:10,412
[SPEAKER_15]: The motion is that it fails.

2027
03:41:10,953 --> 03:41:13,574
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Mustone's going to put a motion to approve the budget after.

2028
03:41:17,756 --> 03:41:18,317
[SPEAKER_15]: She voted no.

2029

[SPEAKER_18]: I can't write that fast.

2087
03:43:11,300 --> 03:43:12,661
[SPEAKER_15]: Member McLaughlin seconded.

2088

[SPEAKER_15]: slash SD 1308.

03:43:42,579 --> 03:43:55,449

2101
03:44:13,139 --> 03:44:20,184
[SPEAKER_22]: The Massachusetts Healthy School Lunch Bill calls to replace disease promoting foods typically served for lunch with healthful and planet friendly whole foods.

2102
03:44:20,664 --> 03:44:27,369
[SPEAKER_22]: It also holds food service companies accountable to ensure the nutritional quality of school food is prioritized over profit.

2103
03:44:27,833 --> 03:44:31,314
[SPEAKER_22]: It is time to address inequitable diet-related disease in children's health.

2104
03:44:32,195 --> 03:44:41,158
[SPEAKER_22]: And this is asking the legislation will provide much-needed nutrition security for the more than 500,000 students who rely on school lunches each day.

03:45:12,026 --> 03:45:16,187
[SPEAKER_19]: We have no way to approve a calendar for ourselves now that we don't have another meeting ahead.

2117
03:45:16,207 --> 03:45:19,708
[SPEAKER_19]: Excuse me?

2118
03:45:21,988 --> 03:45:24,129
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, for the upcoming fiscal year.

2119
03:45:26,555 --> 03:45:29,036
[SPEAKER_19]: we must approve a calendar for ourselves.

2120
03:45:29,076 --> 03:45:31,157
[SPEAKER_19]: We can't just start showing up out of the blue.

2121
03:45:32,657 --> 03:45:39,059
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm feeling like we need to now make a decision to have another meeting.

2122
03:45:40,600 --> 03:45:42,881
[SPEAKER_19]: Otherwise, how does the decision to have a meeting happen?

2123
03:45:44,221 --> 03:45:50,403
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't know what other people think, but... Can this be added to the agenda when we do the superintendent's evaluation?

2124
03:45:51,355 --> 03:45:54,098
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm fine with that, but we need to make sure it happens.

2125
03:45:54,138 --> 03:46:00,665
[SPEAKER_15]: Otherwise, you know, when we're supposed to come back.

2126
03:46:01,926 --> 03:46:05,550
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2127
03:46:05,590 --> 03:46:06,611
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a motion to adjourn?

2128
03:46:07,032 --> 03:46:09,635
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to adjourn by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Hays.

2129
03:46:09,675 --> 03:46:10,375
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

2130
03:46:10,696 --> 03:46:10,816
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

2131
03:46:11,056 --> 03:46:11,637
[SPEAKER_15]: Opposed?
