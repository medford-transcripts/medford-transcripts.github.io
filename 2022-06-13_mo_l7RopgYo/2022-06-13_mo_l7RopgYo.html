    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5.68s">that</a>  the network was chosen from a total of 580 applicants. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=11.682s">They</a>  plan on using this funding over the next two to five years in order to better connect with families in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=20.445s">I</a>  also wanted to recognize Mr. Tremonti's eighth grade class at the Hamptons Middle School. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=26.407s">They</a>  shared their civics project with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=29.708s">The</a>  students developed a banner which promotes <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=36.732s">As</a>  one of the quotes on the banner states, when we all give, all gain. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=42.396s">The</a>  banner can be seen as one enters the foyer of the Andrews Middle School. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=64.314s">and</a>  unfortunately they did lose three to two, but congratulations nonetheless. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=69.559s">And</a>  likewise, the boys played Westside High School in West Springfield. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=75.283s">And</a>  unfortunately they did lose as well with a 10 to five, but despite the losses, we are very proud of all of the spring sport athletes within Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=88.094s">So</a>  again, those of you who are interested in sports, <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=92.438s">The</a>  fall sports season that's coming up the portal will be open, and you'll be able to register there. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=99.068s">I</a>  wanted to also thank the class of 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=103.342s">This</a>  was the first graduating class that was impacted by COVID-19. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=108.646s">This</a>  class could not celebrate their graduation with a prom, a barbecue, senior breakfast, and an in-person graduation ceremony. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=120.694s">Despite</a>  missing all of this, they still wanted to leave something behind for future generations of Mustangs. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=128.846s">Last</a>  Thursday, Mayor Rungelkorn, Dr. Cushing, Assistant Principal Bloch, the 2020 class advisors, Mr. Joseph Donlon and Mrs. Nancy Donlon, and the 2020 class president, Mark Allen Jean-Marie, and Class Secretary Elijah Fortune. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=150.679s">They</a>  helped to unveil a beautiful Mustang statue. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=155.242s">It's</a>  placed near the entrance to the Caron Theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=159.425s">The</a>  plaque that accompanies this beautiful bust of a Mustang head says in recognition of the class of 2020 Medford High School Medford vocational technical high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=172.457s">We</a>  remember your strength resilience and unending commitment to our school community. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=179.083s">You</a>  so ably demonstrated the true meaning of Mustang spirit, setting an example for alumni and the many students to follow. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=189.426s">Special</a>  thanks to Mr. Devaney of Oak Grove Memorials for designing the marble base that supports the bust and giving the school a significant discount. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=204.47s">to</a>  have that bust displayed beautifully in the foyer area. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=211.878s">So</a>  last week, we had the opportunity to enjoy some events that in the past we would have missed out on. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=221.047s">We</a>  celebrated our Junior Olympics at Hormel Stadium with fifth graders. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=228.735s">It</a>  was an absolutely beautiful day. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=230.697s">Member</a>  Graham, Member McLaughlin, Mayor McLaughlin, Mayor Lungo-Koehn, Member McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=239.125s">Our</a>  athletic department, our phys ed teachers, all of our elementary principals, the students, they had the opportunity to really participate in Olympic sports, run around, the teams were mixed up so they got to see <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=258.388s">new</a>  friends and people that they will be together with next year when they go to middle school. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=263.396s">So</a>  there were a lot of parents PTO was actively involved, and it was truly a great event for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=272.265s">I</a>  also wanted to say that last week we had a wonderful celebration at the new library. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=278.309s">It</a>  was the elementary read-a-thon. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=281.892s">And</a>  at last count, that read-a-thon raised over $31,000 from all of the four elementary schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=292.799s">The</a>  students did an outstanding job reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=296.841s">over</a>  two to three weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=298.882s">And</a>  I want to thank member Graham was there may along will Kern was there as well, recognizing our students giving them treats, and just thanking them for reading taking on that challenge, and not to let reading go by the wayside. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=316.086s">I</a>  also want to thank the library staff <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=318.828s">for</a>  allowing us to use their beautiful facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=321.754s">It</a>  was a wonderful event, recognizing students from pre-kinder all the way up through fifth grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=332.02s">This</a>  week and next week are going to be moving on ceremonies for our eighth graders, for our fifth graders. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=339.883s">So</a>  there are definitely a lot of moving on ceremonies that are coming up and we will have those specific dates posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=348.427s">They'll</a>  be going out to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=351.848s">So</a>  depending on which school, they're all different dates, but it's a wonderful time of year.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=359.391s">I</a>  also want to. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=360.192s">Superintendent,</a>  can I just stop you for a second? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=362.353s">Yes,</a>  please. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=363.513s">There</a>  is some confusion about the proper Zoom link. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=365.894s">The</a>  one on our agenda is apparently not the Zoom link that we are in right now and there are people looking at the Zoom link on the agenda and waiting to get into that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=377.26s">So,</a>  can we take a five-minute motion to recess?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=382.303s">Motion</a>  to take a two to five-minute recess until we figure this out, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=387.421s">by</a>  Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=389.284s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=390.025s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=390.546s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=391.367s">Let's</a>  get this together. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=785.822s">Sorry,</a>  sorry, false alarm. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=787.743s">You</a>  have another minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=788.884s">Dr.</a>  Edouard-Vincent, let's finish up.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=791.266s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=792.286s">The</a>  last piece that I said was that there will be multiple moving on ceremonies at both the fifth and eighth grades. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=800.012s">Please</a>  look out for school-based communications so you can have the exact time and location at your respective schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=809.598s">Um,</a>  we will be since this is the final regular meeting of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=815.244s">This</a>  is our last Monday of being in school before the school year lets out. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=821.089s">We</a>  will have summer fun camp starting on July 5 at the miss a tuck. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=827.936s">And</a>  then there will be plenty of <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=831.914s">clinics</a>  being offered this summer for any of our athletes volleyball girls lacrosse, basketball, soccer. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=841.518s">So</a>  please go to the school blog to find out the information for that Medford rec and the Maldon why. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=849.881s">At</a>  the GMAC gym, and the new Medford public library, they are hosting many summer events, so please take advantage of that as well look at their respective websites. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=862.472s">I</a>  want to wish all of our dads out there a happy Father's Day, this coming Sunday, this coming Sunday. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=868.817s">June</a>  19. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=870.299s">I</a>  also want to just remind everyone that June 19 is Juneteenth. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=877.546s">It</a>  became a federal holiday last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=881.25s">The</a>  name is the blending of the words June and 19th. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=886.607s">It</a>  commemorates June 19th, 1865, the day that the Union Army Major General Gordon Granger rode into Galveston, Texas and told slaves of their emancipation. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=901.456s">That</a>  day came more than two years after President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1st, 1863. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=913.678s">even</a>  after Lincoln declared all enslaved people free on paper that hadn't necessarily been the case in practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=922.364s">Juneteenth</a>  is also known as Emancipation Day, Jubilee Day, Freedom Day, and Black Independence Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=931.631s">People</a>  across the country celebrate with food and festivities, much like the 4th of July. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=938.416s">In</a>  celebration of Juneteenth, schools will be closed on Monday, June 20th. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=945.48s">School</a>  will resume on Tuesday, the 21st, and our last day of school is Thursday, June 23rd. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=954.824s">So</a>  as I said, this is our last regular school committee meeting of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=960.147s">We</a>  will be scheduling additional meetings, which we mentioned earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=963.829s">I</a>  especially want to thank <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=969.358s">all</a>  of our students and staff, as well as our school committee for another successful school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=976.323s">I</a>  want to congratulate our educators and staff who are retiring this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=981.908s">And</a>  since we are still finalizing details on this list, we will be individually recognizing all of our retirees at our first meeting officially in September. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=996.499s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

<a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1174.621s">The</a>  purpose is for us to fulfill the directive stated in Chapter 71B of the Massachusetts General Laws, which requires a school district to establish a PAC <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1185.492s">and</a>  assigns both an advisory and a participatory function to the PAC. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1190.595s">In</a>  meeting this requirement, the mission of the Medford Special Education Parent Advisory Council is to advise the district on matters that pertain to the education and safety of students with disabilities by seeking input from the special education parent members. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1206.943s">Meet</a>  regularly with school officials to participate in the planning, development, and evaluation of the school district's special education program <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1216.186s">to</a>  participate in planning workshops and activities as prioritized by the CPAC board. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1224.93s">Even</a>  though we did most of our presentations, actually all of our presentations this year via Zoom, we were actually very successful in presenting a lot of great topics and we had a really good turnout. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1237.835s">We</a>  do hope to go back to in-person for the next school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1242.457s">But</a>  the 2021-2022 school year highlights <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1246.516s">We</a>  offered several content-rich presentations throughout the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1251.1s">Also,</a>  our presentations, when we have speakers qualify as two PDPs for teachers and staff, if they attend the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1260.848s">And</a>  some of our topics included disability rights as human rights, understanding the IEP, understanding dyslexia, declarative language on and beyond the spectrum, <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1276.448s">And</a>  then to continue in collaboration with the special education department CPAC presentations have highlighted initiatives in the district, as well as Medford specialists and special education service providers. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1290.216s">With</a>  the disability awareness initiatives in Medford public schools, and we had physical and occupational therapy district specialists present at the last presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1301.547s">And</a>  we plan to continue our close collaboration with the district and add more such presentations in the new year. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1311.509s">CPAC</a>  concerns and recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1313.79s">So</a>  the CPAC is focused on moving forward the disability awareness training for staff and the disability awareness curriculum for students in all schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1322.872s">We</a>  are concerned that the 2021-2022 resulted in a pause of these initiatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1328.41s">We</a>  hope the district recognizes the importance of these programs and is committed to their implementation. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1335.054s">We</a>  are concerned on how staff shortages, special education teachers, and special education paraprofessionals impact our students with disabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1343.819s">We</a>  are further concerned regarding a shortage of substitute special education paraprofessionals, which impacts the ability to support students as specified in their IEPs. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1354.369s">In</a>  addition, CPAC was made aware of school policies which allow for disciplinary referrals and incident reports to be added to a student file without parental notification. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1364.233s">And</a>  just to clarify, it might be a misunderstanding or a miscommunication that's lending to that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1372.076s">These</a>  policies have the potential to disproportionately impact students with high needs and their families. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1377.738s">We</a>  recommend the school committee strengthen the language of these policies <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1381.334s">and</a>  introduce unambiguous conditions that trigger parental notifications so that the parents will have the same information that the administration and the school has. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1391.822s">And</a>  then we wanted to open up for any questions.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1397.566s">Member</a>  McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1399.107s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1399.708s">Thank</a>  you for the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1400.828s">I</a>  always appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1403.65s">I</a>  do have a couple of questions if I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1406.412s">I</a>  wanted to ask, do you also advise and support <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1410.267s">parents</a>  or caregivers with questions regarding special education supports and services. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1414.87s">Do</a>  you guys take phone calls or talk to families about any of those needs?</p>

    <p>[Sullivan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1419.374s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1420.094s">Um,</a>  we do talk to families separately and we are looking to, uh, next year open office hours, uh, so that families who may not be able to attend the meetings, um, will still be able to express their concerns, um, to the CPAC so that we can work with administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1438.792s">to</a>  make sure that the community is getting what they need.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1440.992s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1441.413s">And</a>  next year is an election year, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1443.813s">So</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1444.633s">So</a>  for people that are interested in running, what should they do or how can they participate if they're interested in supporting either the CPAC board or running for any of the positions or what have you? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1454.275s">Is</a>  there a way to be involved?</p>

    <p>[Sullivan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1455.776s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1456.316s">They</a>  can reach out to us directly. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1458.216s">They</a>  can either call us or they can email us at medford.cpac at gmail.com is probably the best way to get in touch with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1464.877s">We</a>  are always looking to grow the CPAC. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1468.226s">A</a>  lot of people are always busy, everybody's busy, but taking the time to become a part of this, we all became a part of this because we had a concern about our own child. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1481.889s">And</a>  then when you get in, you realize that you can make a difference for a lot of children. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1487.39s">And</a>  we would really appreciate any volunteers that can help in any capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1493.191s">It</a>  doesn't need to be every single <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1495.67s">meeting.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1496.01s">It</a>  doesn't need to be every single event. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1499.513s">But</a>  any, any volunteers would be greatly appreciated.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1503.035s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1503.416s">And</a>  again, you don't have to be a parent or a family member of a child with a disability, you can just be an interested party. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1511.421s">May</a>  I may I just have two more? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1512.963s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1513.243s">Yeah,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1515.304s">I</a>  have three more actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1516.245s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1516.825s">One</a>  is the next one is on have you guys done I know that there's a programmatic elements to the special education department. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1522.769s">So</a>  there are different <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1523.928s">strands,</a>  if you will, of classrooms, of sub-separate classrooms in our district. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1529.369s">For</a>  example, an access program, connections program, therapeutic learning program, those sorts of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1535.711s">I'm</a>  wondering, does the CPAC do tours of those programs, strands at all? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1539.291s">Have</a>  you guys looked at, or are there tours available that you guys do do so that you're looking at the programmatic elements?</p>

    <p>[Sullivan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1546.385s">As</a>  CPAC, we haven't necessarily toured them, especially not in the last few years.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1551.11s">I</a>  guess it's maybe a question for Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1552.431s">Bowen.</a> </p>

    <p>[Sullivan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1553.052s">So,</a>  I mean, that is something that we're looking to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1555.654s">We</a>  would like to be able to do that so that we can have a better understanding and a better kind of vision so that when we're telling parents information about these programs, we're speaking from experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1568.266s">We're</a>  speaking from what we're seeing. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1569.828s">We're</a>  speaking about what we know. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1571.893s">as</a>  opposed to what we know on paper.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1574.034s">And</a>  also the charter is to advise the district on matters pertaining to special education.</p>

    <p>[Sullivan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1578.055s">So</a>  you're seeing the classrooms and the environment and you can advise on what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1581.856s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1582.236s">I</a>  mean, some of us have seen, have seen these classrooms as a parent, you know, observer, but in a capacity to kind of speak to, you know, outward facing community, we would definitely need to see all of them.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1596.259s">Does</a>  that need to be a motion, Joan, or is that something that can</p>

    <p>[Joan Bowen]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1599.364s">No,</a>  that's something we can arrange. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1600.906s">We</a>  have had discussions prior to the school closure about having more students. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1605.289s">So</a>  I think we'll revisit it when things calm down. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1607.912s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1609.513s">We'll</a>  be in communication regarding that.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1611.915s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1612.296s">And</a>  then if I can ask, I guess this is for Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1613.797s">Bowen,</a>  how do we address the issue, concern number two, the staff shortages? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1619.082s">I</a>  know that it's COVID and this has been an issue across the country and I know that there's a lot of concern with <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1628.057s">Well,</a>  first of all, just having special education paraprofessionals, but also having a substitute pool for them, because in a lot of instances, or some instances paraprofessionals are specifically part of the child's IEP, whether it's one-on-one or a classroom para, and so it's a legal requirement, obviously, that we have those paraprofessionals. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1646.722s">What's</a>  the plan to try to address that?</p>

    <p>[Joan Bowen]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1648.663s">So</a>  that's the million dollar question. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1651.085s">We</a>  are working really hard to recruit more staff members. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1655.307s">It's</a>  been a struggle across all districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1657.729s">They're</a>  experiencing the same shortages that we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1661.111s">We're</a>  hoping with contract negotiations with the paraprofessionals, we wanna do more training with them as well to hope to get more paraprofessionals to come to the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1672.352s">We</a>  are advertising everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1674.093s">If</a>  people know someone who's interested in being a paraprofessional, please have them send in their resume to me, but we are constantly looking and using all platforms that we possibly can to hire and recruit.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1686.442s">And</a>  I think just on the, and this might be a Mr. Murphy question sort of issue that was brought up, but I think on the paraprofessional, I was told, I think by a paraprofessional or someone, <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1697.93s">Um,</a>  that's, I think it's no longer with the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1699.751s">If</a>  you are out sick, there's not an option for a substitute button or something like that.</p>

    <p>[Joan Bowen]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1704.432s">I</a>  forget.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1705.312s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Joan Bowen]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1705.632s">I</a>  mean, when, uh, when a power is absent, there's not, um, but we have created these open positions that when we know that there is a need for a power in one of our substant substantially separate programs or a student that requires, we are trying to get someone to cover that paraprofessional. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1722.638s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1723.393s">It's</a>  moving pieces, but there's not a lot of staff that we're able to move around at this point.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1729.136s">Maybe</a>  we can check in on that again mid-year or something next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1731.997s">And</a>  then I promised my last question, colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1734.678s">Thank</a>  you for indulging me. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1737.459s">Actually,</a>  it's a motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1738.86s">It's</a>  on your last recommendation regarding the incident and discipline reports that are created and put in students' files that can disproportionately impact students with high needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1753.158s">I'd</a>  like to make a motion that this issue be referred to the Rules, Policy, and Equity Subcommittee to review. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1760.723s">And</a>  I'm wondering if I might have a second for my, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1763.965s">Motion</a>  by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Mustone. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1766.646s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1767.547s">Can</a>  I speak on that, actually? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1769.248s">Before</a>  the roll is called, Member Ruseau.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1771.53s">Thank</a>  you, actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1772.51s">My</a>  question was actually about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1776.332s">Do</a>  you have <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1777.719s">you</a>  know, you reference policies, do you actually know what the policies are? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1782.004s">Like,</a>  is there a list?</p>

    <p>[YeIUKo9SmWU_SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1783.907s">So</a>  the policy is in the handbooks, the school handbooks, and I look at most of them, I look at elementary and middle school handbooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1794.72s">First</a>  of all, when you go on the website, <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1797.955s">I</a>  think none of the school has the most current handout. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1801.578s">They</a>  are called different way, different names. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1804.2s">So</a>  it's the family handbook, it's the student handbook, it's the student and parents handbook. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1808.063s">So</a>  that is confusing. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1810.104s">And</a>  then most are two years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1813.627s">I</a>  asked Mr. Tucci, so for the McGlynn Middle School, I have reviewed the latest just to make sure that there is not <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1821.004s">like</a>  a difference in language. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1822.664s">But</a>  yeah, so I look at the handbooks that I don't know if there is any other rule. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1826.365s">And</a>  the handbook says that referrals may result in pattern notification, but they don't have to result in pattern notification. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1833.027s">And</a>  also there's the confusion regarding disciplinary referrals and incidents reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1839.868s">The</a>  handbooks seem to suggest that the incident reports are only filed for like very serious offenses like drug issues or harassment. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1849.231s">But</a>  in reality, it seems that <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1851.877s">It's</a>  not only that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1853.578s">So</a>  it's the language is very confusing. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1855.498s">And</a>  then the issue itself, for me, at least what's very confusing.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1859.06s">Thank</a>  you, certainly. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1859.96s">The</a>  issue of the handbooks being outdated in our website. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1865.262s">I</a>  won't get into the website right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1866.903s">But,</a>  um, so I think that I certainly support the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1871.184s">I</a>  just think that <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1874.349s">we</a>  need to know which policies we're reviewing, because I don't think it's appropriate to cast a net where the rules and policy subcommittee should essentially review the whole handbook, because the committee- Point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1886.855s">Approves</a>  the handbooks.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1888.916s">Point</a>  of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1890.036s">Point</a>  of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1891.317s">Your</a>  question, Member McLaughlin?</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1893.177s">Yeah,</a>  well, I guess it's more, not a question, but a clarification for the point of information is that- It's a point of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1900.441s">Yeah,</a>  a point of clarification where you are asking specifically <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1903.499s">I</a>  am asking specifically that the policy for disciplinary referrals and incident reports allow for parental notification. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1913.285s">So</a>  we can, I think it's our job to find out what the current policy is that exists in both our online policy and rules and policy handbook, as well as the student handbooks and make sure that those are consistent. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1926.252s">But</a>  essentially I can speak from personal experience regarding incident reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1931.007s">We</a>  had multiple that we were frankly unaware of until we were leaving the district and became aware of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1937.889s">And</a>  that's not the way one wants to find out, especially when we want to support our students while they're in school. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1945.09s">So</a>  the motion is specifically addressing a referral to the rules, policy and equity subcommittee to review disciplinary referrals and incident reports so that those are shared with parental notification. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1960.622s">because</a>  that seems not to either be an existing policy in the current rules policy and equity listing and or some vagary in the student handbook. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1969.146s">So</a>  that's my specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1971.708s">Is</a>  that helpful? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1972.408s">Mayor?</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1973.949s">Before</a>  the roll call, Member Ruseau, are you all set? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1976.97s">No,</a>  but I can wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1978.171s">You'll</a>  yield to Member Graham?</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1981.676s">I</a>  was wondering if the communication and family engagement subcommittee was the more appropriate committee to send this to, given that what we're talking about is parental communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1997.328s">So</a>  just a suggestion that we find the right committee for it to go to.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2003.293s">May</a>  I respond? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2006.135s">Member</a>  Ruseau will yield to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2007.416s">Member</a>  McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2008.541s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2009.341s">I</a>  appreciate that through the chair, member Graham, that this is a family communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2013.424s">It</a>  is also policy specifically regarding disciplinary referrals and incident reports, because those policies do go into the student file. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2023.57s">So</a>  it's a policy in terms of what's in the file, not just the family engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2027.573s">So</a>  I think that there's a step that can be missed there if it's not part of policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2032.096s">I</a>  know that I spoke with one of our administrators about what the existing policy is around the structure of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2038.246s">have</a>  been told that there isn't one in terms of what the process is. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2042.568s">So</a>  I think there's a couple of issues to be addressed, but I would say, I think it's the policy subcommittee because we really need to create a policy since there isn't one that exists.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2052.433s">Mayor.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2054.274s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2054.654s">Member</a>  Ruseau.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2056.343s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2056.803s">So</a>  I did find the incident reports policy, which I will admit, I did not know we had. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2062.728s">And</a>  in fact, it does reference serious incidents, but what is fascinating about it is that nowhere in there, is there any suggestion that the family should be communicated with? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2074.998s">So</a>  if we can, a friendly amendment to actually specify the particular policy, because I just don't wanna, I don't want a motion where it's like, I'm just hunting all the policies.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2086.232s">No,</a>  that's agreed. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2086.913s">You</a>  can include that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2088.053s">What's</a>  the policy number?</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2088.974s">Policy</a>  CLB incident report.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2091.135s">Say</a>  it again.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2091.836s">CLB</a>  is the policy ID. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2093.517s">It's</a>  incident report.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2094.678s">CLB</a>  incident reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2096.239s">I</a>  will amend that to the motion.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2097.82s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2103.984s">Should</a>  I read the motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2106.066s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2108.047s">Oh,</a>  yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2108.567s">Just</a>  want to make sure your microphone's on, please.</p>

    <p>[YeIUKo9SmWU_SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2111.55s">So</a>  I just want to make sure that the issue is not only the incident report, but also the referral report, which seem to be different, the disciplinary referral, which is communication between staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2122.995s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2124.096s">And</a>  may or may not have an incident report.</p>

    <p>[Sullivan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2128.457s">And</a>  the referral seems to be, it doesn't necessarily need to be with something, you know, very aggressive, but it seems to be the way that it's communicated throughout administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2140.363s">It's</a>  almost like a, <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2142.012s">communication</a>  process more so than a like an incident report similar to an incident report. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2148.755s">So</a>  it seems very different but sometimes those words are used interchangeably.</p>

    <p>[YeIUKo9SmWU_SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2152.877s">And</a>  it does go in the student record.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2157.779s">Member</a>  McLaughlin?</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2159.08s">Yes</a>  and also you know just to make matters a little bit more confusing and I know the Director of Pupil Services knows this but not necessarily all educators know <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2172.162s">you</a>  know, that the disciplinary referrals for students with disabilities has some requirements and some structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2180.548s">And</a>  so, especially regarding suspension and expulsion and some other issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2186.012s">So</a>  there's some nuances around this. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2187.873s">So</a>  if there is not an existing policy, it may be that this should go to the special education subcommittee first to think about what the nuances are around the disciplinary referrals, <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2201.749s">specific</a>  to the special education law and how that can be communicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2210.319s">So</a>  if I can, if my colleagues are in agreement, I think I might split the motion.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2214.343s">Before</a>  you split the motion, I think Dr. Edouard-Vincent wants to comment.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2221.533s">Yeah,</a>  I just wanted to comment because as I'm listening to the conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2226.539s">I</a>  definitely am in support of visiting the incident reports in correcting the language for the disciplinary referrals piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2238.536s">I'm</a>  not really clear in terms of what it is specifically that you're asking and I'm just thinking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2245.541s">Is</a>  this something that's going to be putting an additional burden on the classroom teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2253.346s">If,</a>  if you know something that like a very minor infraction takes place in the classroom that it's it's documented but to say every single time. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2264.973s">something</a>  happens that there's parent notification so I, I am in support of sending it to the subcommittee to try to unpack it and unpack it in terms of a reasonable way parents definitely are notified I know when there are serious infractions that take place, but I just don't want it to be something where it's something that's so minor and. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2290.735s">It's,</a>  it's addressed but it ends up now being an additional demand in terms of students with disabilities member McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2302.225s">We</a>  definitely work with building based special education administrators and. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2310.471s">The</a>  administrators also know that there are special rules, different rules, rules for students with disabilities regarding suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2318.878s">So</a>  that is really on everyone's radar. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2323.022s">And</a>  if in fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2326.164s">discipline</a>  stronger discipline needs to be meted out, then we definitely consult with special education administrators, prior to that taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2335.01s">So</a>  I just wanted to say that it is something that we're aware of and miss Bowen is here she can speak to that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2345.345s">I</a>  just wanted to comment so that you're aware I am willing to, you know, address the incident reports and get the policy formally revised, but I am cautious about saying every single thing needs to be revised because we do need to document <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2367.059s">but</a>  not everything is worthy of, you know, a phone call calling the parent immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2372.541s">Cause</a>  it's, it's something else that we would be adding to the instructional day.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2375.842s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2377.663s">Member</a>  McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2378.803s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2379.303s">Thank</a>  you, superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2380.944s">I</a>  just wanted to mention as well, though, that if the, if the document, even if it's a minor infraction, if it's going in the students, <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2389.685s">record</a>  and can affect the students placement potentially, among other things, then it does feel like it should be something that the parents are notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2400.151s">But</a>  I think that this is a discussion, a longer discussion for another day. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2404.593s">So</a>  if I might, I would like to split the motion so that <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2408.174s">We</a>  refer the incident report motion to the rules, the policy and equity subcommittee based on the policy DLB incidents that member Rousseau just mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2421.437s">And</a>  then my second motion for the split would be that we refer disciplinary referrals to the special education subcommittee meeting to work a little bit more on the language and work with collaborate with the superintendent and director of pupil services to <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2437.697s">better</a>  understand why CPAC is specifically making this recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2443.019s">If</a>  I could have a second.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2445.98s">Motion</a>  for approval by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Mustone. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2450.341s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2452.022s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2452.442s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2453.282s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2455.743s">Member</a>  Mustone.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2457.464s">I</a>  also want to just thank you all because I think it's been years that you were lobbying for the adaptive physical education teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2465.461s">And</a>  this past year has been awesome with the United basketball program that I know Miss Kyla Andre ran. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2470.985s">And</a>  so I just want people to know that CPAC really gets stuff done and that if they're looking to get something done to join your group, because you guys are the best. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2478.79s">So</a>  thank you for being here.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2491.578s">I</a>  just wanted to say thank you as well to CPAC for your continued partnership with Medford Public Schools, including us, notifying us of all of your meetings and giving us an opportunity to communicate more widely with the entire community. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2507.325s">So</a>  thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2508.445s">And</a>  I look forward to our continued partnership moving next year.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2512.807s">And</a>  I believe we have a presentation to a member of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2515.788s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Sullivan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2526.51s">Every</a>  year we like to award a member of the community that makes a difference for our kids and the community basically. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2536.334s">We</a>  awarded to a member in the community who for the current school year has embodied what it means to go above and beyond for our students and families. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2542.917s">So</a>  I just wanted to read a little. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2547.919s">I</a>  can't believe you need me to move closer to the microphone, but I will. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2552.054s">As</a>  parents of a child with intellectual and developmental disabilities, it's always in our vision for our kids to eventually have meaningful employment, which provides them with confidence, a continued place in the community, all while teaching them skills that they can use in their everyday lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2567.722s">It</a>  can be a struggle to make that happen or to even sometimes conceive what steps are needed to ensure that our kids get this experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2575.746s">And</a>  we're grateful for parents who are so brave and who take the necessary steps <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2579.963s">to</a>  secure this for not only their children, but for other young adults as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2584.904s">This</a>  is what Carol Nigro, with the help of many, including Michael Nigro, Heather McKinnon, Denise Desjardins, and of course Kelsey, and many others, has brought to life. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2595.566s">What</a>  was once just a vision for her daughter is now an astounding reality at the Charlotte and William Bloomberg Medford Public Library with Chapters Coffee Cart. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2604.128s">We</a>  urge you all to visit and frequent this business. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2607.009s">And</a>  we would like to present, let me bring Carol up here, <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2619.707s">And</a>  we would like to present Carol the CPAC award this year for believing that she could, so she did. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2625.072s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2633.739s">Can</a>  we get a picture with the school committee and Carol and CPAC? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2636.862s">Would</a>  that be okay, Mayor?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2638.24s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2639.261s">And</a>  Carol, can you give chapters a plug? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2642.063s">I</a>  know that's a long time coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2643.584s">You've</a>  worked with the city, you've worked with CPAC, a number of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2647.567s">You</a>  had a vision a long time ago and you even had to go through the procurement process with the city and you did it. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2654.092s">And</a>  now you have our children up at the second floor in the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2657.474s">So</a>  if you want to give it a plug, let us know where your hours are and make sure everybody stops by and grabs a cup of coffee.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2663.999s">Well,</a>  first of all, we're thrilled and honored <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2667.901s">to</a>  be able to set up our first cart in Medford, and to be able to carry out our vision that inclusion works, and to share our model with other communities, to have them look at us in the Medford Public Library, and we hope that it will be a chain reaction into other cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2692.95s">We're</a>  currently open Monday through Saturday, 9 to 3. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2698.035s">And</a>  the rumor is that the coffee is really good. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2703.98s">That's</a>  what we heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2704.6s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Coffee Roasters. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2706.382s">So</a>  come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2707.203s">Today</a>  was definitely an iced coffee day. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2710.626s">And</a>  we'll have it ready for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2712.307s">Wonderful.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2712.588s">So</a>  come see us.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2713.468s">Great</a>  job. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2720.427s">If</a>  the committee wants to come up and CPAC and Carol, your husband. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2724.603s">Yep.</a> </p>

    <p>[Joan Bowen]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2785.266s">And</a>  Tanya leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2787.527s">I</a>  just wanted to say a little thank you give you a little thank you for all your hard work as our co chairs for the last few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2795.413s">I</a>  know you're shy. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2797.975s">They</a>  give up so much of their free time. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2800.838s">We</a>  meet on a monthly basis I'm sure they look forward to eight o'clock on a Friday morning with Joan Bowen. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2807.123s">But</a>  we meet, we collaborate, we work for the students with disabilities in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2812.544s">And</a>  I wouldn't want to work with any other parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2817.285s">You</a>  guys are the best. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2818.426s">You</a>  are so collaborative.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2820.046s">And</a>  I just wanted to say thank you from all the students.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2828.288s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2828.828s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2835.913s">Great</a>  presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2838.735s">We</a>  have approval of the 2022-2023 district calendar, Dr. Maurice-Edouard-Vincent, Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2847.422s">Motion</a>  for approval by Member Mustone, seconded by- Second. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2851.204s">Member</a>  McLaughlin, I'm sure it'll be up on our website right after approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2854.847s">All</a>  those in favor?</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2856.168s">Mayor,</a>  can I just ask a couple quick questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2861.07s">On</a>  the calendar, the dates in June 13, 14, 15, and 16, say noon dismissal, 6 to 12.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2869.21s">Linda's</a>  missing for secondary schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2871.892s">Yeah,</a>  so the secondary schools are on a slightly different schedule than K five. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2878.256s">So,</a>  for elementary schools they would have a regular school day. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2882.478s">The</a>  last day of school would be at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2886.581s">If</a>  we have no snow days Friday, June 16, the first day this year Wednesday, August 31, so those three half days. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2897.968s">Dr.</a>  Cushing, one clarifying question. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2900.611s">On</a>  the 16th for secondary, on Friday, June 16th, 1130 dismissal for middle school, noon dismissal for elementary and high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2919.41s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2921.112s">So,</a>  so my question is or my request is that at the bottom that the green be listed as tentative dates because those dates will move if there are snow days. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2931.76s">Is</a>  that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2932.6s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2933.201s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2933.341s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2934.061s">If</a>  you're like me and you put all this stuff on your calendar last year when this came out, it just comes as a surprise to you this week that Thursday is in fact not a half day because the dates have shifted. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2944.909s">So,</a>  if it can just be noted as tentative, <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2948.391s">so</a>  that people understand that there's, like, don't write this down and forget that you wrote it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2953.632s">I</a>  think that would be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2956.873s">And</a>  then my other question was whether the dates in yellow were all grades.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2965.154s">So</a>  the dates in yellow are noon dismissals, and we will not be having the early release for <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2977.498s">Oh,</a>  it's to be determined so it's still under negotiations, but the yellow dates. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2984.661s">At</a>  this point in time would be for all grades, and then we are working on that early release day of Wednesdays, where we part of our proposal was for that not to exist anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2999.786s">So</a>  we're still negotiating that but this was the. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3007.709s">in</a>  order to have additional professional development with staff.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3020.492s">It's</a>  yet to be determined. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3022.633s">That's</a>  why it's not specified. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3023.733s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3024.053s">So</a>  we'll definitely add a notation, maybe put an asterisk or something on that last week saying that these attentive dates, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3035.916s">hoping</a>  that there are no snow days or inclement weather days that would require us. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3042.101s">So</a>  this is not set in stone. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3046.804s">180</a>  days is our obligation to be in school for students. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3051.547s">So</a>  according to this calendar right now, June 16th is day 180 for our general education population.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3064.396s">Okay,</a>  so can we also make a note that the the noon dismissals in yellow just put something like tentative or pending. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3073.565s">I</a>  know there's a lot still going on with this discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3078.11s">If</a>  we're going to put out a calendar, we're going to create questions if we can't be clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3081.594s">So</a>  I think we just need to be able to tell people what is <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3084.481s">tentative</a>  or pending. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3085.601s">And</a>  then I do think we need to commit to like resolving this particular issue as quickly as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3092.863s">Because</a>  while high school students can go home by themselves, if we're going to impact kindergartners, they can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3098.905s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3099.605s">And</a>  we need to make sure that parents have adequate time to plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3102.246s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3104.606s">Thank</a>  you, Member Graham, Member McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3107.233s">Yes,</a>  thank you, I just wanted to say thanks for all the hard work that went into this whoever put this together did a nice job and also I think it's been addressed through. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3115.078s">The</a>  Chair and Member Graham, but just to clarify that the the early release days and what have you are still in negotiation and those need to be marked as tentative until they're finalized in negotiation.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3129.409s">Yeah,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3129.829s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3131.17s">Member</a>  Ruseau, unless you want to yield.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3133.751s">I</a>  just want to quickly, can we have the back page updated to reflect the policy that we actually have on our website on the MASC page? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3143.314s">There</a>  are several things, several items in here, which are not marked as no school days, but in fact are no school days on the policy, on the policy manual online. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3153.467s">I</a>  went through each of them and thankfully none of them impact, none of them are occurring on a school day. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3158.531s">So,</a>  you know, Eid al-Adha is a no school day. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3165.056s">They're</a>  all on the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3165.977s">Just</a>  use the list on the website, which is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3169.039s">There</a>  are three no school days that we approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3173.503s">They</a>  are all on weekends. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3175.024s">So</a>  it's not gonna affect us, but I want this back page to reflect the actual policy of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3183.533s">Right,</a>  yeah, we have these little ends for no school days and how we'll play it forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3187.695s">But</a>  three items on here do not say they're no school days when they in fact are no school days. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3193.258s">It</a>  just happened to land on weekends or in July. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3195.679s">So</a>  I just don't want, I've seen this one circulated a few times in this quarter as we've tried to work this out. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3204.483s">And</a>  I'm like, that's not the right one. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3206.124s">The</a>  right one's on the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3207.885s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Joanne McKay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3213.254s">Hi,</a>  Joanne McKay, 35 Court Street, Metro Mass Roberts School. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3218.237s">I'm</a>  here tonight to discuss our concerns with the calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3221.599s">Thank</a>  you, Member Graham, for addressing that because that's what we're here for. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3226.022s">So</a>  Mr. Murphy shared the calendar with the union prior to tonight's meeting, and we did find some errors on the calendar that we pointed out that seemed to have been fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3235.148s">However,</a>  the one issue that we are a little unhappy about <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3239.671s">is</a>  the concern about the Wednesday early release. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3242.813s">As</a>  part of negotiations with administration, administration has asked that Wednesday's early release be changed to a full day and we are in discussions with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3252.778s">We</a>  realize the importance of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3254.819s">The</a>  teachers understand that a full day is something that is very important and we are working <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3261.343s">with</a>  administration about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3262.644s">However,</a>  it is not finalized. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3265.286s">Our</a>  contract is not has not been ratified. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3268.528s">We</a>  don't have a tentative agreement on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3270.77s">It's</a>  just something that we are in discussions despite the value we see in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3276.209s">we</a>  do not feel it should be on the calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3278.07s">Now</a>  we pointed this out, the other changes were made. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3281.012s">The</a>  prior calendar has a little, the yellow symbol said six to 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3287.175s">It</a>  also had a white box that said elementary was early release. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3292.118s">And</a>  what we're wondering is if someone can speak to the legality of passing a calendar that has changes that have not been agreed upon by a ratified contract, putting a little thing that says to be determined <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3306.613s">we're</a>  going to have to change the calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3307.634s">In</a>  our opinion is just. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3309.456s">It's</a>  not satisfactory to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3310.898s">It's</a>  not acceptable because it if it doesn't get ratified by next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3315.364s">It</a>  looks bad on the teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3318.628s">Because</a>  then the <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3327.83s">this</a>  is something that we are discussing and we find great value in. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3331.352s">Unfortunately,</a>  it hasn't been ratified right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3334.433s">So</a>  we're asking that it not be put on the calendar that way, because it is misleading to parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3339.816s">And</a>  for parents who do not understand the calendar, new parents, kindergarten parents, preschool parents, they're going to think it's a full day. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3347.66s">And</a>  it's going to be difficult for them for child care if it does not get ratified before the start of the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3353.944s">So</a>  we respectfully ask you not to pass the calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3356.874s">that</a>  is not specific enough for parents, that is not ratified by our contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3361.616s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3362.316s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3366.117s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3366.558s">I</a>  certainly understand the concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3368.498s">I</a>  believe this body is required to pass a calendar and this is our last meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3374.82s">So</a>  if we don't pass a calendar at all, there is no first day of school.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3390.792s">Mr.</a>  Murphy?</p>

    <p>[David Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3399.477s">No,</a>  I'm happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3402.178s">And</a>  professional. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3404.64s">The</a>  calendar doesn't specify whether there are early release days on Wednesdays or not, because as was just stated, that issue hasn't been determined yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3414.245s">If</a>  the contract in the school year 22-23 <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3418.533s">has</a>  early release days, despite, as we've just heard, the acknowledgement it's not what's best for students, then we will have early release days. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3429.875s">If</a>  it's not in the contract, then we will have full school days in the interest of students. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3435.717s">This</a>  calendar, as the union was told at the end of last week, is designed to provide the flexibility that both parties would presumably want <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3447.608s">pending</a>  the outcome of those negotiations. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3451.25s">It</a>  doesn't say what grade levels are going to have half days, because we don't know what grade levels are going to have half days. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3457.553s">Although,</a>  frankly, that wouldn't be a matter for the contract if the administration decided that those were half days for students, just like if they decided it was cancel, cancel, cancel days, then that's what would occur. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3469.537s">There's</a>  nothing misleading about this calendar and the pieces of information that were in the previous calendars are not there because as was stated, it's something that's currently being negotiated. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3481.086s">I</a>  think what's going to be more confusing is we have, if we have to continually publish new calendars, but what I'm more disheartened by is that when the calendar was provided to the union and the opportunity for questions was raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3496.806s">the</a>  questions that came, all the questions were answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3500.97s">We</a>  weren't told that there would be an attempt to upend the school committee's work this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3505.315s">And</a>  I find that disappointing.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3507.116s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3508.718s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Murphy. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3517.527s">Is</a>  there a motion on the floor?</p>

    <p>[Joanne McKay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3522.928s">Hi,</a>  we're not trying to upend anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3525.469s">We</a>  saw the calendar prior to coming here and we looked at it and we said, oh, that change wasn't reflected. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3533.951s">And</a>  then we came, we were actually in a meeting and then we came and said, let's speak to it so that we could have clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3541.954s">We're</a>  not trying to cause a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3543.355s">We're</a>  trying to stop a problem because we know how hard childcare is. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3548.24s">You</a>  see all over Medford Moms, how hard childcare is for these parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3553.664s">And</a>  this could be confusing. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3554.865s">And</a>  if it is not established before the start of the school next year, it's going to be a big problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3561.551s">That's</a>  why we're here. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3562.312s">We're</a>  not here to upend anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3563.673s">I</a>  just want to let that be known. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3565.855s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3715.475s">Mayor.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3718.858s">In</a>  past calendars, at least I think this is true, there were start and end times somewhere present on the physical calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3729.648s">So</a>  elementary starts at whatever the time is, middle school starts at whatever the time is. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3736.114s">One</a>  solution that I think would be the most clear for parents who are not <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3741.518s">in</a>  the thick of union negotiations is to post school end times with a Wednesday end time of TBD. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3750.867s">So</a>  that it's clear that on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday, elementary school students are going to get out at 235 and that they need to seek additional information from us at some point in time about the end time for Wednesdays. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3766.68s">And</a>  I think that <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3767.765s">sufficiently</a>  tells people that this is a work in progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3772.126s">But</a>  ultimately, you know, we do have to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3775.507s">And</a>  the other thing I want to point out is that the school committee did pass a policy that this calendar would be issued in November so that people could plan and obviously negotiation years sort of exacerbate these kinds of things that are otherwise simple to accomplish year after year. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3792.93s">But</a>  hopefully we can get on a better schedule for the next school year.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3798.78s">Thank</a>  you, Member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3799.701s">So</a>  is that a motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3800.982s">We've</a>  already passed it, so is that a motion to adjust the language on the front cover for now?</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3807.068s">Yeah,</a>  motion to add school start and end times to the official calendar and notes that Wednesdays are TBD for elementary.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3880.58s">make</a>  you aware that the planning and training that we're talking about are critical. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3885.964s">Metro</a>  Public Schools engages with about 5,000 plus individuals on a daily basis, including all of our students, staff, people who approach our schools in our close-knit urban community. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3898.154s">And</a>  that requires a certain degree of preparedness. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3903.197s">to</a>  make sure that we're ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3904.457s">The</a>  plans that we're going to speak about today are largely confidential as they represent the safety and security planning that is essentially our playbook and any compromise of that would be a compromise of the safety and security of our faculty and students and all other members of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3924.642s">Regardless</a>  of that, what I do want to say is that we have an approach <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3931.966s">to</a>  really look at prevention, planning, and preparedness. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3936.33s">So</a>  starting with the classroom, the ability for classroom educators, the ability for classroom paraprofessionals, for anyone on the staff to build relationships and connect with our students so that they know a student and they know when something might be a little bit different or something might be a little bit off, that then we can have <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3956.043s">and</a>  interaction with them that may be above and beyond. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3959.826s">But</a>  social emotional learning in the classroom is really about having students achieve personal and collective goals with their peers, feel and show empathy for others, and establish and maintain supportive relationships while making those responsible decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3975.299s">So</a>  we've seen the castle wheel numerous times throughout this year for social emotional learning in the classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3981.213s">Today,</a>  I'm not going to talk so much about the wheel as I'm going to talk about those rings around it, that classroom, those schools, families, caregivers, and communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3990.316s">So</a>  really, classrooms built on SEL offer an ecosystem for that prevention aspect, for us to be building relationships with students. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4004.1s">And</a>  that type of prevention and preparedness is the best type of response for any type of incident. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4011.232s">Our</a>  coaches and club advisors are also critical to supporting above and beyond. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4016.561s">So</a>  that's just the first aspect. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4019.36s">We</a>  have a robust counseling and behavioral health services program. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4025.585s">Um,</a>  we have, um, clinical social workers, your traditional school guidance Councilors, uh, BCBAs school psychologists who work in concert and support with, uh, our school nurse nurses and school leaders, school leaders being members of the central leadership team, school principals, school assistant principals. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4047.316s">Those</a>  relationships are more than just discipline. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4050.077s">It's</a>  about educators in the leadership ranks, making those important connections with students. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4057.698s">So</a>  once again, they're aware when a student may be acting differently, may need extra support, may need help, or that there may be a trigger for something. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4069.841s">Counseling</a>  team provides this interconnected web of support for students. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4074.455s">And</a>  we believe that students should be known by a member of the counseling team so that there's an interaction connection. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4081.38s">Adjustment</a>  Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4082.4s">What</a>  is an adjustment Councilor? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4083.861s">An</a>  adjustment Councilor is a clinically trained social worker. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4087.223s">This</a>  might be an LICSW, an LCSW, an LMHC, or any other number of people who have received clinical training to really support our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4097.708s">We</a>  are currently working towards the one to 250 ratio that was mentioned by Mr. Anderson last week in his public comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4106.094s">Um,</a>  right now, uh, I believe that we are really striving towards that at the Brooks, the McGlynn elementary and the Roberts as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4115.56s">Um,</a>  and we are close on those. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4117.002s">I</a>  don't have the exact ratios here with me today, but we are close on those. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4121.805s">Uh,</a>  adjustment and Councilors also provide a level of intervention to support students. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4126.744s">And</a>  so communication with families when incidents occur. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4130.566s">And</a>  interestingly enough, one of the things that we will be working on this summer in conjunction now with the rules, policy and equity subcommittee is reviewing and revising as necessary, the insert recording framework. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4141.993s">So</a>  parents and caregivers are aware and can partner with the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4148.757s">And</a>  it was printed before press time. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4152.38s">Um,</a>  so, uh, just wanted to make you aware of that, um, that that was on our slate to really do this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4159.836s">Threat</a>  assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4160.896s">So</a>  I will not give you an open session, the exact program that we use. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4165.918s">It</a>  is a very scripted and form-driven and procedural threat assessment process. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4173.859s">I</a>  received training in it pre-pandemic, which while that was only in November of 2019, it feels like it may have been in 1970 because of just all the events of the past few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4185.618s">So</a>  this is an approach to institute violence prevention through problem solving with students. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4193.343s">It</a>  involves assessment and intervention with students who have threatened violence in some manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4198.207s">This</a>  is a standardized process that has been deployed across the district and we'll be working with the appropriate staff this year to provide a refresher that once again was delayed by the events of the pandemic and all the other things that had to be done, but this will be provided <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4214.219s">this</a>  year as we re-enter the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4218.802s">So</a>  some more specific threat guidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4222.024s">These</a>  are embargoed as part of our hazard safety and security plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4226.967s">The</a>  threat assessment includes the following identification by concerned members of the community, evaluation by the trained team, and then intervention by the trained team or outside providers <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4238.283s">in</a>  support of the school and the child. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4240.024s">This</a>  is really about getting the child as much help as possible, as much support as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4245.648s">And</a>  while some people may at times think, oh my God, a threat assessment, is that an overreaction? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4251.192s">I</a>  would argue that we no longer live in a world where threats are ever greeted with an overreaction. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4258.237s">Given</a>  situations that we've seen in our country, our school and partnering personnel need to respond appropriately <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4267.557s">in</a>  each individual situation to make sure that safety for all of our community members is really there. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4273.159s">And</a>  then again, going back to that incident reporting, that there's family caregiver follow-up so that they're on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4281.443s">And</a>  if they may not necessarily be on board, that we're working with them to come to a place of collaboration and hopefully agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4291.977s">So</a>  hazard safety and security planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4294.679s">This</a>  is really what you would think about the actionable steps to train faculty and staff to respond once an incident or situation has occurred. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4306.525s">This</a>  is when everything else we have done for preparedness and prevention may have not necessarily been successful and realize that there will be certain things that we simply cannot plan for. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4322.383s">and</a>  to respond similarly across different buildings and situations. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4328.786s">So</a>  right now, actually working with the Mayor's Chief of Staff to form the Municipal Safety Council to bring those people together for the benefit of the Medford Public Schools, and are also working to form our first Medford Public Schools Leadership Safety Council, at least before pre-pandemic times.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4352.959s">In</a>  addition to the Municipal Safety Council and the Medford Public Schools Leadership Safety Council, we also have a universal safety committee, which meets monthly, and it has a CPAC representative, our Director of Pupil Services attends those meetings, a school committee representative, <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4375.748s">Special</a>  education coordinators are part of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4378.85s">High</a>  school principals, middle school principals, and elementary school principals are also part of the safety committee taking into account all of our populations within the school community when emergency situations may arise. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4396.601s">Questions?</a> </p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4404.241s">Our</a>  next slide, so we're right now working with numerous stakeholders to construct an emergency operations slash immediate response plan that will provide those standardized responses across situations. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4422.012s">They</a>  will also provide various critical pieces of information for each school as relates to locations, telephone numbers, <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4431.398s">various</a>  things along those lines that are part of your traditional emergency response plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4437.722s">Please</a>  do not think that this is an exhaustive list. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4440.983s">It</a>  is pretty comprehensive, but it's not an exhaustive list. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4445.066s">While</a>  we were working on this initially pre-pandemic in February of pre-pandemic time, I think we added about 15 things to an existing protocol that we are going to flesh out <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4458.777s">and</a>  build. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4459.377s">We're</a>  also going to create an appendix of letters that serve as a guide for school leaders to notify the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4468.301s">In</a>  the last several weeks, if you're a member of our middle schools, parents have received communications, and that's all in an effort to be transparent and to provide as much up-to-date information as necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4483.891s">And</a>  so for areas for growth, so we're continually examining our protocols and structures for school safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4491.633s">So</a>  a couple of things following two years, it's really about getting back to some staff training, training all staff to be vigilant with door security and to pose these and other questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4502.957s">So</a>  do we leave? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4503.737s">Do</a>  we shelter in place? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4505.117s">What</a>  are the alternate means of egress? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4507.218s">Are</a>  windows an option? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4508.278s">These</a>  actually all come from a memo from, <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4512.052s">uh,</a>  the state fire marshal on, uh, emergency fire drills and other drills along that line. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4518.736s">Um,</a>  how do we inform, uh, leaders and others when there is a situation that they may not be aware of within the building? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4527.704s">Building</a>  walkthroughs with Metro Police and Fire are currently being scheduled. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4531.648s">I</a>  had a conversation today with Office of the O'Growth, through Office of the O'Growth with the Chief, to provide a comprehensive assessment of our readiness. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4540.475s">And</a>  finally, review the security infrastructure and cost estimates for enhancements in two specific areas, security cameras and exterior door access.</p>

    <p>[Sharon Hays]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4560.332s">Hi,</a>  yes, thank you for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4564.054s">I</a>  mean, it's a lot of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4565.735s">And</a>  we appreciate you putting them all together. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4568.837s">I</a>  have a few questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4571.218s">Just</a>  I know, obviously, the questions we're getting these days from families and have been getting is based on what we're learning in the moment about what happened in Uvalde and some of the issues that are coming up that they found <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4587.54s">were</a>  problematic, the reasons why the shooter was able to get in, why maybe no one knew that this person was clearly in trouble and needed help. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4596.543s">So</a>  a couple of questions I have when I look at, you said that 1 to 250 ratio that we're getting close to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4604.925s">I</a>  seem to recall an earlier meeting this year where I thought we were told that we were at that, and I don't know if we're talking about different numbers and different <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4613.581s">because</a>  I know there's adjustment Councilors, there's guidance Councilors, there's all different forms, but I know at some point there was that one to 250 ratio and I thought we were told that we were at that and maybe even a little better than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4624.688s">So</a>  I'm curious if that's a different number or why I'm hearing a difference now that I feel like I'm hearing a difference.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4632.713s">So</a>  we are there at the middle schools and high school and we are definitely working towards that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4639.677s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4641.598s">they're</a>  in the budget, and to bring those up to speed. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4647.081s">So</a>  I can't honestly remember the specifics of the meeting you're referencing at this time, but I do know that we are working towards that, and that if you were to consider, this is specifically for adjustment Councilors, but if you were to consider all counseling staff, I would go out on a limb and say that we are definitely there, but realize I'm on a limb</p>

    <p>[Sharon Hays]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4671.664s">okay</a>  and then I'm wondering too so um another thing that they've definitely talked about is um and this would also get to the staffing ratios or how we I honestly don't know how we go about doing this but you know that that a key a key thing to have is to try to make sure that every student has one adult who they are <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4695.071s">in</a>  contact with or who is kind of there watching them in a way or has a relationship with them, that schools try to build that into their structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4709.097s">Whether</a>  it's the teacher, whether it's a Councilor, whether it's a club advisor, are we in any way looking at how we could try to systematically build that in? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4720.621s">I</a>  know we've got large numbers of kids, but <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4723.158s">And</a>  I know that that's something that seems to come up with every one of these school shootings saying that this was a person who was kind of on the fringes and wasn't being watched or was didn't have an adult that was. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4735.694s">And</a>  I think, in this case, obviously, we've all did it was already out of school, so if that wouldn't change the school setting but. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4741.69s">In</a>  some cases, for kids who've been in school, it does.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4744.852s">I</a>  think one of the things that Medford has done over the past 12 months in bringing on board the re-engagement specialists adds an additional layer of support to really focus on those students who may be not traditionally connecting, as well as to make sure that our classroom teachers <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4767.583s">Unfortunately,</a>  students who may not be connecting, generally speaking, don't involve in clubs, activities, sports. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4775.889s">And</a>  I know teachers who frequently will have conversations with students to get them engaged, try to get them to a club, try to get them to a sport or whatever else it may be. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4786.443s">But</a>  I think that with what Medford has done with the re-engagement specialists and the hub to also converse about students in need is one way that we can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4796.045s">We're</a>  also talking about revamping how big advisory groups are at the high school so that we can have smaller groups with more adults involved so that students can have that sense of connection and maintain that connection throughout their four years, at least at the high school.</p>

    <p>[Sharon Hays]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4815.74s">I</a>  have some other basic questions, but I think other people.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4820.181s">I'll</a>  let others go if someone else wanted to ask some questions.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4825.082s">Member</a>  McLaughlin and then Member Hays can have a floor back. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4830.064s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4831.424s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Cushon for the report and thank you for including an incident process on the report as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4838.066s">That</a>  was nice to see and the synchronicity was good to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4845.506s">I</a>  have a question on the Municipal Safety Council and the MPS Leadership Safety Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4851.229s">In</a>  both of those instances, I was wondering if I might make a friendly suggestion or if it's been considered that there's some sort of community representative there that is, you know, also that we're considering diversity. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4865.357s">I'm</a>  sure we're considering diversity in the high school, middle school, and elementary school representatives, and I don't know if that's where <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4873.137s">you're</a>  factoring families in or if you're thinking about students for those. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4876.32s">So</a>  I wanted a little bit of clarification of where community involvement can be engaged in those.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4882.104s">So</a>  unfortunately, this is not an opportunity for community involvement.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4887.368s">Because</a>  it's embargoed?</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4889.13s">Say</a>  again?</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4889.65s">Because</a>  it's embargoed?</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4891.455s">Because</a>  these are the, like, these are the highest level of security plans that the district has. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4899.2s">And</a>  I fully respect the call for community involvement on most things. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4904.863s">But</a>  I want to make sure that our students, staff, and those who come to our schools on a daily basis <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4911.351s">are</a>  safe and secure.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4912.551s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4913.091s">And,</a>  um, while there are many trusted members of the community, um, who I look to seek, um, their input on various things, I, I don't necessarily, and I'll have, I'll be happy to bring this up with the chief and other members, uh, when it comes. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4928.415s">So</a>  I don't want you to think it's a, it's a no outright. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4931.696s">Um,</a>  however, this is, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4936.971s">You</a>  know, in Maslow's hierarchy, you know, in order to reach the fulfillment stage, you gotta make sure that you're safe and you're secure. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4946.698s">And</a>  I take this to be extraordinarily important work, and I wanna make sure that the other people who will serve on these committees are okay with saying that that's a possibility.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4961.428s">I</a>  can appreciate that, and I can certainly appreciate that, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4965.916s">top</a>  secret nature, if you will, of the plans and making sure that that kept that's kept internal. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4970.942s">So</a>  I guess the other thing I would ask is about quarterly meetings with the USC, the Universal Safety Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4977.05s">So</a>  not necessarily regarding the embargoed material, but more specific to <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4982.54s">the</a>  students with additional needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4984.801s">So</a>  also going down to your next, um, uh, quadrant where you have a number of the different things that would be considered by these, um, by these councils, I would suggest adding slide 12.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4998.886s">What</a>  would that be? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=4999.526s">Slide</a>  12.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5000.827s">I</a>  would suggest adding, uh, students with additional needs, um, here because there's a lot, <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5006.564s">that</a>  the USC has considered, specifically around physical needs? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5010.446s">Do</a>  we have the stretchers that we need if a person's not able to be mobile? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5013.808s">How</a>  do we get them out? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5014.748s">How</a>  many are there? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5015.969s">Where</a>  are the classrooms located? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5017.369s">Are</a>  they near the stairs? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5018.47s">Those</a>  kinds of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5019.951s">Does</a>  law enforcement know where the classrooms that have substantially separate students with additional needs? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5027.307s">a</a>  substantially separate classroom so that they have access to those, they know where those are. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5031.81s">And</a>  also the autism training that the law enforcement currently does. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5036.553s">So</a>  I forget his name, the law enforcement officer who's currently running the autism training for law enforcement, but I would really recommend that that goes underneath the students with additional needs aspect as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5048.84s">As</a>  we've been playing out different scenarios in the universal safety committee, one might imagine, for example, you know, a horrible situation in the school <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5056.59s">something's</a>  happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5057.991s">And</a>  one of the students is in the bathroom, maybe as a student with, you know, a disability, you know, with a need or whatever, and, and heads towards the law enforcement personnel, because they have an uncle who's a police officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5071.178s">And,</a>  you know, they're wondering if they might know them or any number of things, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5074.5s">How</a>  does one recognize that that could be a student that has some additional needs, doesn't know that like, so we have to think about that in terms of the planning as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5082.445s">So</a>  the USC has done some of that work. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5084.758s">But</a>  I would highly encourage that those items be added to that specific category with some subcategories be added to the security hazard safety and security planning that you're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5096.205s">And</a>  maybe quarterly meeting with the USC or members of the USC that you feel are appropriate in terms of the privacy concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5105.291s">And</a>  then lastly, I guess I would just ask for some sort of professional <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5109.577s">maybe,</a>  I don't know, not development, but some sort of maybe meeting or something like that, that addresses the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5117.043s">So</a>  maybe it's an annual event where it's at, you know, the theater or something, but somewhere where the community does feel like they're engaged and involved in this, not necessarily around plans specifically, but around addressing, you know, safety and school concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5131.894s">And,</a>  you know, it can include a panel where people are talking or, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5135.544s">movie</a>  that sort of addresses or some experts or something, but some way in which the community can feel engaged on this on an annual basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5143.149s">So</a>  those are my questions slash comments.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5146.171s">Yeah,</a>  I'm appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5147.232s">I</a>  appreciate those. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5148.153s">Well,</a>  happy to bring them to the larger group when we meet.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5155.538s">Member</a>  Hays, do you have another question? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5156.718s">And</a>  then Member Ruseau? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5158.8s">We</a>  had somebody online. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5161.582s">Okay,</a>  Member Hays, and then we'll go to</p>

    <p>[Sharon Hays]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5164.048s">Yeah,</a>  I was just wondering if at some point we could also just go over, I think, you know, again, parent letters that we've gotten have also been questioning kind of at a more basic level, you know, things like the intercom systems at the doors. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5184.182s">They're</a>  not necessarily consistently used at every school to let someone in. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5188.801s">I</a>  know that some schools have a, such as the one I'm at, the Roberts, you know, there is a person sitting at a front desk. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5195.586s">I</a>  understand that the security cameras, but you know, the question we've gotten is, but by the time you let someone in, you know, that's, that, that doesn't help, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5206.473s">So,</a>  so if you, if you're not questioning who's coming in and why, you know, that seems like a pretty basic safety thing that could be in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5214.158s">Questions</a>  about, you know, are, do we have a way of ensuring that, <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5218.973s">Doors</a>  that go to the outside once the kids are in in the morning, are they locked? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5222.956s">I</a>  did notice somebody the other day at the Roberts again, going around and checking doors just to make sure they were locked. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5228.62s">Just</a>  are there actual protocols in place for ensuring that these things happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5235.105s">I</a>  think some of those for the community, some of those kind of basic things would be as much a sense of security as some of these higher level things that are important too, but just that idea of <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5247.677s">What</a>  are some of the basic things at each school that are in place each day that ensure the kids are safe in their school, you know?</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5257.005s">And</a>  we can make sure that we update you on all of those. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5260.088s">But</a>  also, you know, want to make sure that you know that we have all communicated with our principals to make sure that they're informing staff, like somebody runs out to the car quick and may want to prop open a door or something along those lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5275.311s">that</a>  that's not acceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5277.373s">That's</a>  a piece of concrete about that big could disable the best security system in the world if it's propped in the appropriate location. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5287.021s">And</a>  so the important thing is for all of our staff to remain vigilant, for our parents to remain vigilant. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5295.108s">If</a>  they see something, say something. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5298.011s">And,</a>  you know, to help be part of the solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5301.962s">And</a>  the best way to do that is if somebody does see something to first contact the school principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5307.821s">The</a>  school principal or assistant principal are the best people to go to for immediate action and immediate rectification of anything that someone may see. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5318.083s">But</a>  we are working also to make sure that all of our staff are trained on the proper entry procedures to access the buildings and for them to state who they are, their purpose for being there, and who they are there to see.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5336.408s">Thank</a>  you, we have somebody on Zoom, an Adam that would like to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5340.73s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Jessica Healey]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5345.732s">Hi,</a>  Jessica Haley, Full Off Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5347.973s">I</a>  just have a question or comment about having like police officers every day at each school or like adopting the guardian program that Florida has in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5363.885s">have</a>  we looked into anything like that? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5365.505s">Because</a>  my son's school, I noticed after the tragedy in Uvalde, there were officers at the school at drop off and pick up, but that lasted for two days. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5377.728s">So</a>  obviously we thought we needed them there, but for two days and then they're gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5384.289s">Also</a>  with the doors being opened during the day, a year or two ago, someone, <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5392.625s">did</a>  get into my son's school. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5395.266s">Thankfully</a>  he wasn't armed or anything like that, but when kids were coming in from recess, he did get in and they would have been known there to do anything to protect the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5408.59s">So</a>  I'm just wondering, are we thinking on anything on those lines of protecting our schools in that way? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5415.672s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5419.105s">So</a>  the Medford police and the Medford public schools have a very strong relationship. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5425.67s">But</a>  there's significant debate around how many officers should be in schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5435.076s">And</a>  while it provides safety and security, and I've had tremendous luck working with all the school resource officers in my career who <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5443.972s">The</a>  seven or eight of them have been nothing short of phenomenal and built real relationships and have been coaches, club advisors, those types of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5453.538s">I</a>  do know that there are also staffing challenges in that area and the ability to provide what would essentially be eight resource officers might be a challenge across all the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5471.95s">I</a>  think that I want to go back to, and I appreciate your comments, that the most important thing is for all staff to remain vigilant, to make sure that doors are closed, make sure that doors are locked, make sure that first floor windows are closed and locked. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5485.517s">Those</a>  types of things are extremely critical to the safety and security of our students and staff.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5492.961s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Cushing. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5496.883s">Motion</a>  to receive and place on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5501.325s">by</a>  member Stone, seconded by member Hays. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5506.492s">All</a>  those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5507.973s">Thank</a>  you so much, Dr. Cushing. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=5510.036s">We</a>  have an update on implementation of the NWEA map by Dr. Marice Edouard-Vincent, our superintendent.</p>
