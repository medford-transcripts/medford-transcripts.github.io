1
00:02:03,015 --> 00:02:03,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

2
00:02:03,515 --> 00:02:04,976
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

3
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,670
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Justin, you on?

4
00:02:45,191 --> 00:02:45,431
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

5
00:02:48,172 --> 00:02:48,392
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.

6
00:02:50,993 --> 00:02:51,213
[SPEAKER_01]: Ready?

7
00:02:52,593 --> 00:02:54,554
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I have to do a roll call?

8
00:02:56,495 --> 00:02:58,075
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to do roll calls for all votes.

9
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:00,936
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't technically have to do a roll call for attendance, but you can if you want to.

10
00:03:00,956 --> 00:03:01,616
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll still let you.

11
00:03:02,697 --> 00:03:02,837
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

12
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:05,918
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.

13
00:03:07,363 --> 00:03:13,645
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, welcome to the meeting of the Medford Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee.

14
00:03:14,585 --> 00:03:21,647
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the first meeting that I've been in where we are testing out our new AV system.

15
00:03:21,667 --> 00:03:27,508
[SPEAKER_01]: So you might notice some technical difficulties going on with that.

16
00:03:27,588 --> 00:03:34,470
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe what you do, Councilor Callahan-Lazaro, is press the

17
00:03:36,465 --> 00:03:41,959
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, Kevin Harrington is kindly instructing.

18
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:56,974
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

19
00:03:57,154 --> 00:04:03,635
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, if you want to, the way that this works is you put yourself in the queue.

20
00:04:03,675 --> 00:04:10,557
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when I put next on, that means that I can end up sort of choosing people in the order that they press their little mic button.

21
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:19,438
[SPEAKER_01]: So I could also try to make it so that we could all just talk at once, but I'm going to have to get used to these new controls here.

22
00:04:19,498 --> 00:04:20,538
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.

23
00:04:20,618 --> 00:04:22,079
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing that

24
00:04:23,599 --> 00:04:31,125
[SPEAKER_01]: We are going to go over this session is the draft of the Medford City Council newsletter for October 2024.

25
00:04:32,286 --> 00:04:38,211
[SPEAKER_01]: I ended up, I was the one who drafted this.

26
00:04:38,251 --> 00:04:44,156
[SPEAKER_01]: It essentially just goes over everything that we've covered in the past month.

27
00:04:46,018 --> 00:04:47,339
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like

28
00:04:48,603 --> 00:05:08,903
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I sent the meeting out, I sent the document out to all my colleagues prior to this, and just invited everybody to offer their comments as some folks are doing right now in this at the moment, like, even as we speak.

29
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:25,370
[SPEAKER_01]: Councilor Sang, I would like to also draw your attention just to the governance committee, as well as Councilors Lazar and Callahan to the committees that you chair, just to be sure that the descriptions that I wrote for those are accurate.

30
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:34,635
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have any thoughts or questions or ways that you think things should be edited, feel free to let me know.

31
00:05:41,187 --> 00:05:46,449
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

32
00:05:46,609 --> 00:05:47,089
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

33
00:06:01,774 --> 00:06:04,095
[SPEAKER_01]: Kevin, it says that her mic is on.

34
00:06:04,555 --> 00:06:04,955
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on.

35
00:06:06,715 --> 00:06:08,136
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, but it's.

36
00:06:14,985 --> 00:06:15,746
[SPEAKER_07]: In the chamber.

37
00:06:15,766 --> 00:06:16,446
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh huh.

38
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:18,768
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's looking good.

39
00:06:18,968 --> 00:06:19,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

40
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:21,029
[SPEAKER_07]: Tasty.

41
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:22,370
[SPEAKER_07]: Um.

42
00:06:23,811 --> 00:06:28,975
[SPEAKER_07]: Just there's a typo at the end of the first general business point and invest $4 million to invest.

43
00:06:54,334 --> 00:06:55,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Lemming, if I may.

44
00:06:57,396 --> 00:06:58,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Councilor Sang.

45
00:06:59,757 --> 00:07:05,020
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just going to say, I realized I had notes on proposed edits to

46
00:07:06,587 --> 00:07:21,051
[SPEAKER_04]: To the newsletter draft, I realized since I can't make it in person today, it'd be easier for me just to leave my comments as comments and suggestions for you guys to consider.

47
00:07:22,051 --> 00:07:31,874
[SPEAKER_04]: I also see that there are folks here who are potentially here for the second agenda item, which we will not be discussing details of today.

48
00:07:33,294 --> 00:07:36,835
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to give a quick one-sentence summary when Chair Lehmann calls for it.

49
00:07:37,296 --> 00:07:43,838
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to, let's, I understand that we're just, I just want to do, finish editing the newsletter and then we will.

50
00:07:43,878 --> 00:07:55,462
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I just, it'll just take us like 20 minutes to edit and I don't want, it'll take us 20 minutes to edit it and I just don't want folks to be staying on longer than they want to be.

51
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:58,751
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

52
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:00,512
[SPEAKER_01]: So, all right.

53
00:08:00,552 --> 00:08:04,174
[SPEAKER_01]: So if councillors, that's reasonable enough.

54
00:08:04,214 --> 00:08:20,464
[SPEAKER_01]: If councillors would like to spend a little bit of time editing it while we go through Councillor Sang's presentation on the next agenda item, then feel free to do so.

55
00:08:20,484 --> 00:08:22,345
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand that

56
00:08:23,792 --> 00:08:27,555
[SPEAKER_01]: Due to some emails flying around, not everybody has been able to do so.

57
00:08:27,615 --> 00:08:44,748
[SPEAKER_01]: But if Councilor Sang would like to offer a brief presentation on the state, on the Human Rights Commission, then as he wants to, then he can go.

58
00:08:44,908 --> 00:08:45,929
[SPEAKER_01]: Then feel free to take it away.

59
00:08:47,482 --> 00:08:48,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Chair Lemmy.

60
00:08:48,263 --> 00:08:51,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Presentation is very generous of a word, as I told you, Chair.

61
00:08:51,945 --> 00:08:54,467
[SPEAKER_04]: I really don't have much of an update for this committee.

62
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,588
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still working through it.

63
00:08:58,129 --> 00:09:11,038
[SPEAKER_04]: I sat down with the mayor and our DI director, Francis Wojciech, recently to talk through their ideas and potential disagreements on it.

64
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:16,662
[SPEAKER_04]: They are still reviewing the draft that I shared with this committee.

65
00:09:17,722 --> 00:09:37,611
[SPEAKER_04]: earlier in the year with some potential edits that they have told me that they would want to make, but it's very much still in conversation and I don't have anything for this committee right now or for the public.

66
00:09:38,571 --> 00:09:44,814
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll let everyone know once those edits are available, but they are currently not available.

67
00:09:50,626 --> 00:09:52,487
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Councilor Sang.

68
00:09:52,507 --> 00:10:03,691
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the very brief update on the State of the Human Rights Commission, we will move on.

69
00:10:03,711 --> 00:10:07,633
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any other comments from Councilors?

70
00:10:07,653 --> 00:10:11,474
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, we'll move on to public comment.

71
00:10:11,574 --> 00:10:15,055
[SPEAKER_01]: I see Steve Schnapp's hand raised on Zoom.

72
00:10:15,075 --> 00:10:16,276
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just gonna ask him to unmute.

73
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:19,399
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

74
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:24,585
[SPEAKER_00]: I just was curious if the draft that Justin presented to the mayor.

75
00:10:26,007 --> 00:10:27,068
[SPEAKER_00]: If that is available.

76
00:10:30,412 --> 00:10:31,794
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's, oh, sorry.

77
00:10:33,456 --> 00:10:34,497
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, go, go for it.

78
00:10:35,038 --> 00:10:35,859
[SPEAKER_01]: Without that.

79
00:10:39,218 --> 00:10:41,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, can you repeat that one more, once more?

80
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:48,684
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard you say that you presented a draft to this committee and then met with the mayor.

81
00:10:50,945 --> 00:10:55,348
[SPEAKER_04]: I presented that draft to the DI director and the mayor as well.

82
00:10:55,488 --> 00:11:04,313
[SPEAKER_04]: And the DI director and I had worked on the same document.

83
00:11:05,657 --> 00:11:19,404
[SPEAKER_04]: documents the director had put in some notes on potential discrepancy and that was sent to the mayor.

84
00:11:19,464 --> 00:11:20,385
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that public record?

85
00:11:21,526 --> 00:11:21,626
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

86
00:11:22,822 --> 00:11:28,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, but, but once the mayor sends back, um, any actual edits to the document.

87
00:11:28,165 --> 00:11:35,588
[SPEAKER_04]: So right now there are no edits to the documents, no real edits documents that, um, presented to the committee.

88
00:11:35,988 --> 00:11:38,729
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um, one air sends back to edits.

89
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:42,151
[SPEAKER_04]: I will share them all with, uh, with the committee and with the public.

90
00:11:43,372 --> 00:11:43,652
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

91
00:11:43,672 --> 00:11:43,992
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

92
00:11:51,184 --> 00:11:51,825
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

93
00:11:51,845 --> 00:11:55,846
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any other public comment?

94
00:11:57,346 --> 00:11:59,047
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone else who'd like to speak?

95
00:11:59,067 --> 00:12:03,788
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

96
00:12:04,709 --> 00:12:09,790
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeing none, do we have a motion on the floor regarding this paper?

97
00:12:14,752 --> 00:12:16,993
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to keep the paper in committee and

98
00:12:20,336 --> 00:12:21,157
[SPEAKER_05]: keep paper in committee.

99
00:12:22,238 --> 00:12:22,658
[SPEAKER_01]: Second.

100
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:32,406
[SPEAKER_01]: Motion by Councilor Lozaro to keep the paper in committee, seconded by Councilor Sang.

101
00:12:32,686 --> 00:12:35,028
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Clerk, when you're ready, please call the roll.

102
00:12:35,048 --> 00:12:43,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Lozaro?

103
00:12:43,535 --> 00:12:43,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

104
00:12:44,495 --> 00:12:45,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli is absent.

105
00:12:47,197 --> 00:12:47,698
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Sang?

106
00:12:50,049 --> 00:12:50,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

107
00:12:51,289 --> 00:12:51,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Chair Lemming.

108
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:56,851
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, for an affirmative, none absent, the motion passes.

109
00:13:00,932 --> 00:13:14,035
[SPEAKER_01]: Would also like to note for the AV folks that there might need to be a better system for roll call in the future as well.

110
00:13:14,955 --> 00:13:18,336
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just kind of because it's good

111
00:13:21,129 --> 00:13:26,931
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's better to be able to do it quickly instead of have everybody queue up each and every time.

112
00:13:27,111 --> 00:13:31,212
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's kind of a note for the future with this new audio-visual system we have.

113
00:13:32,893 --> 00:13:38,834
[SPEAKER_01]: But in any case, I'd like to thank everybody for attending for the brief update.

114
00:13:38,854 --> 00:13:43,336
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope that we'll be able to have something public as soon as we can on the Human Rights Commission.

115
00:13:48,510 --> 00:14:00,280
[SPEAKER_01]: Moving back to the newsletter draft, which we can hopefully hammer out and set a record for pretty fast committee meeting.

116
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,702
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to share that once again to Zoom.

117
00:14:03,203 --> 00:14:03,363
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

118
00:14:11,613 --> 00:14:19,098
[SPEAKER_01]: So it looks like we just have a couple of typos, which are entirely my fault.

119
00:14:19,319 --> 00:14:21,120
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just going to go ahead and accept a few of these.

120
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:24,542
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

121
00:14:27,004 --> 00:14:35,610
[SPEAKER_01]: And if any counselor has anything in particular that they'd like to point out in the newsletter or discuss, then just feel free to raise your hand.

122
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,691
[SPEAKER_01]: The counselor is saying, I see that your hand is raised.

123
00:14:38,272 --> 00:14:39,153
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that from before?

124
00:14:39,273 --> 00:14:39,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sorry.

125
00:14:39,653 --> 00:14:40,974
[SPEAKER_01]: That was from before.

126
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:43,155
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, cool.

127
00:14:50,481 --> 00:14:50,641
Yep.

128
00:14:53,443 --> 00:14:54,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I, I don't know.

129
00:14:54,424 --> 00:14:54,984
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, you're recognized.

130
00:14:55,004 --> 00:14:56,445
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why I'm called on with the new system.

131
00:14:56,465 --> 00:14:58,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

132
00:14:58,467 --> 00:14:58,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

133
00:14:58,827 --> 00:15:04,692
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to, via email through the clerk, I had

134
00:15:05,498 --> 00:15:10,884
[SPEAKER_05]: mentioned something about the links being embedded for neatness.

135
00:15:11,865 --> 00:15:14,948
[SPEAKER_05]: I was told that all the links would be embedded, which is great.

136
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:21,235
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have already reviewed the sections on the committees.

137
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:22,035
[SPEAKER_05]: They look good to me.

138
00:15:22,596 --> 00:15:25,839
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you for your work on this.

139
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,042
[SPEAKER_01]: The links I put there solely to

140
00:15:30,882 --> 00:15:40,926
[SPEAKER_01]: The links I put there mainly to just help myself later when I go into latech and create it and format it myself.

141
00:15:43,587 --> 00:15:45,747
[SPEAKER_07]: I've looked through everything and it looks good.

142
00:15:45,767 --> 00:15:53,330
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that Councillor Sang is updating just the governance committee one, but I think my committee is good and the rest of it looks good to me.

143
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:54,951
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you so much for putting it together.

144
00:15:55,611 --> 00:15:55,991
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

145
00:15:57,429 --> 00:16:04,032
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just going through this through and accepting Councilor Sang's edits.

146
00:16:05,813 --> 00:16:16,118
[SPEAKER_01]: It's clear that Harvard Law student is much better at editing texts than a very tired scientist.

147
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,400
[SPEAKER_01]: Unequally tired.

148
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:24,863
[SPEAKER_01]: A very tired Harvard Law student is clearly better with the English language.

149
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:35,240
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me as I just try to find the words for this one point.

150
00:16:45,965 --> 00:16:54,269
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, that looks... Wait, Councilor Sang, is this comment that I'm seeing here...

151
00:16:56,158 --> 00:16:59,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's a proposed edit to what's there.

152
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,222
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see if you prefer it.

153
00:17:01,522 --> 00:17:07,686
[SPEAKER_04]: I just think it's a little bit more organized and more formal in tone.

154
00:17:07,987 --> 00:17:12,150
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'll let the committee discuss it since it's a bigger edit.

155
00:17:19,295 --> 00:17:19,675
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

156
00:17:24,879 --> 00:17:25,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.

157
00:17:30,672 --> 00:17:32,853
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the suggested edit a lot.

158
00:17:33,113 --> 00:17:33,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

159
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:34,294
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.

160
00:17:38,575 --> 00:17:38,996
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

161
00:17:39,216 --> 00:17:56,143
[SPEAKER_01]: And I understand that I was trying to remember that meeting following the four hours and 42 minute Q&A session, which of the resolutions from the October 15th meeting we tabled.

162
00:17:56,323 --> 00:17:59,504
[SPEAKER_01]: And I asked the clerk earlier, and he said that

163
00:18:00,643 --> 00:18:14,647
[SPEAKER_01]: According to his memory, we did not table the commemoration of Sarah Bradley Fulton Day, but we did table the commemoration of the two DPW staff members who returned a lost wallet for the next regular meeting.

164
00:18:14,667 --> 00:18:16,108
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that correct?

165
00:18:17,748 --> 00:18:26,851
[SPEAKER_03]: I know about the lost wallet on this table, but I would have to check the records for the notes for the records to see about the other one.

166
00:18:27,251 --> 00:18:29,212
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was passed, but I'm not entirely sure.

167
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:44,466
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, at the commemorations and acknowledgement section, uh, we, I put the, I put the two, uh, commemorations from the October 15th meeting in there, but we tabled a couple of stuff really, really quickly.

168
00:18:44,506 --> 00:18:49,448
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was having trouble remembering exactly which ones we table and which ones we very quickly passed.

169
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:54,650
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I would, do you want me to run down and check?

170
00:18:59,089 --> 00:19:00,750
[SPEAKER_05]: We passed Sarah Bradley Fulton.

171
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:10,356
[SPEAKER_05]: We tabled the commemoration of the DPW workers that will be discussed, I believe, at the next October meeting on Tuesday.

172
00:19:12,197 --> 00:19:22,543
[SPEAKER_05]: Just because it was so late and we didn't want to give it short shrift, but Sarah Bradley Fulton was coming up that next weekend, so we needed to make sure it was happening.

173
00:19:30,373 --> 00:19:33,716
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we just, how do we make these all just so that people can unmute themselves?

174
00:19:33,996 --> 00:19:34,457
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we?

175
00:19:36,939 --> 00:19:39,181
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, I mean, this is just a regular time.

176
00:19:39,341 --> 00:19:44,426
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, just, didn't we also have that commemoration of Larry Lepore?

177
00:19:44,966 --> 00:19:49,651
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm wondering, do we, in the past, we've left those off of this.

178
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:59,737
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that is accurate that we have not put in like the personal ones about, you know, I started so I started I started doing that because I figured it was it was nice.

179
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:05,242
[SPEAKER_01]: So, in the, you know, in some of the earlier ones we might have accidentally left off.

180
00:20:06,403 --> 00:20:25,616
[SPEAKER_01]: a couple of them or not put all of them on there especially because the initial one was covering a four-month period and it was pretty lengthy as it was but um I think I think moving forward it's probably it would just be nice to show people um who and all was commemorated at these these different meetings.

181
00:20:25,856 --> 00:20:27,958
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll want to put Larry Lepore in here.

182
00:20:27,978 --> 00:20:28,178
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry?

183
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:28,958
[SPEAKER_07]: Larry Lepore.

184
00:20:36,952 --> 00:20:37,933
[SPEAKER_01]: When was that passed?

185
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:07,072
[SPEAKER_01]: What date was Larry's passing?

186
00:21:09,073 --> 00:21:11,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

187
00:21:11,755 --> 00:21:12,976
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

188
00:21:14,096 --> 00:21:15,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Resolution on our suspension.

189
00:21:15,877 --> 00:21:16,238
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

190
00:21:16,378 --> 00:21:22,322
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard for me to find the records of the ones I can get the date.

191
00:21:22,342 --> 00:21:22,482
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

192
00:21:22,802 --> 00:21:27,785
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I know that the date of the resolution was the 15th, but hang on, give me a second.

193
00:21:28,786 --> 00:21:32,849
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the date of the resolution would have been the 15th, but the date of his passing.

194
00:21:34,673 --> 00:21:34,933
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

195
00:21:35,733 --> 00:21:35,933
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

196
00:21:35,993 --> 00:21:36,353
[SPEAKER_01]: October 14.

197
00:21:36,453 --> 00:21:36,853
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

198
00:21:44,795 --> 00:21:46,796
[SPEAKER_01]: Does this seem like an appropriate addition?

199
00:21:46,816 --> 00:21:52,197
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

200
00:21:57,058 --> 00:21:57,338
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

201
00:21:57,638 --> 00:22:00,998
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we have a motion on the floor?

202
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,000
[SPEAKER_01]: Chairman.

203
00:22:07,281 --> 00:22:08,501
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that a second councilor saying?

204
00:22:09,681 --> 00:22:10,222
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a second.

205
00:22:10,282 --> 00:22:14,283
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to note that I put in a few more, just small edits.

206
00:22:14,663 --> 00:22:20,904
[SPEAKER_04]: None of them are really to the content besides there's something small at the end, the residents guide.

207
00:22:20,944 --> 00:22:23,385
[SPEAKER_04]: I just kind of like spelled it out.

208
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:24,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

209
00:22:24,165 --> 00:22:26,146
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

210
00:22:27,806 --> 00:22:30,007
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going through and looking at it and accepting.

211
00:22:31,668 --> 00:22:34,189
[SPEAKER_07]: And I actually do have one like to me.

212
00:22:34,289 --> 00:22:36,170
[SPEAKER_07]: This seems grammatically awkward.

213
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:49,056
[SPEAKER_07]: This section that I like we started discussions on the city charter review process, including setting a timeline as we expect the Charter Review Committee's recommendations to like to me there has to be an ending to that sentence, but.

214
00:22:51,117 --> 00:22:55,760
[SPEAKER_04]: I think grammatically this is correct, but I yeah, it does read awkwardly.

215
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:58,081
[SPEAKER_04]: We can edit it.

216
00:23:00,626 --> 00:23:05,549
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure what you mean as we expect them to continue to arrive or as we expect.

217
00:23:05,749 --> 00:23:09,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, as just signifies that two things are happening at the same time.

218
00:23:10,232 --> 00:23:19,839
[SPEAKER_04]: So we do expect the CRC's recommendations, but we can say to as we expect to receive.

219
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:21,840
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, thank you.

220
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:38,211
[SPEAKER_02]: public vote in.

221
00:23:39,092 --> 00:23:39,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

222
00:24:07,461 --> 00:24:11,702
[SPEAKER_06]: I move to approve and send to, just to approve.

223
00:24:12,582 --> 00:24:17,323
[SPEAKER_01]: Motion by Councilor Callahan to approve and release.

224
00:24:17,343 --> 00:24:18,064
