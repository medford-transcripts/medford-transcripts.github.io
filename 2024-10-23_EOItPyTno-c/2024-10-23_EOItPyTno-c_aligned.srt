1
00:02:03,015 --> 00:02:03,495
Okay.

2
00:02:03,515 --> 00:02:04,976
Okay.

3
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,670
All right, Justin, you on?

4
00:02:45,191 --> 00:02:45,431
Yep.

5
00:02:48,172 --> 00:02:48,392
Cool.

6
00:02:50,993 --> 00:02:51,213
Ready?

7
00:02:52,593 --> 00:02:54,554
Do I have to do a roll call?

8
00:02:56,495 --> 00:02:58,075
You have to do roll calls for all votes.

9
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:00,936
You don't technically have to do a roll call for attendance, but you can if you want to.

10
00:03:00,956 --> 00:03:01,616
We'll still let you.

11
00:03:02,697 --> 00:03:02,837
OK.

12
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:05,918
No, no.

13
00:03:07,363 --> 00:03:13,645
All right, welcome to the meeting of the Medford Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee.

14
00:03:14,585 --> 00:03:21,647
This is the first meeting that I've been in where we are testing out our new AV system.

15
00:03:21,667 --> 00:03:27,508
So you might notice some technical difficulties going on with that.

16
00:03:27,588 --> 00:03:34,470
I believe what you do, Councilor Callahan-Lazaro, is press the

17
00:03:36,465 --> 00:03:41,959
Yep, Kevin Harrington is kindly instructing.

18
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:56,974
Great.

19
00:03:57,154 --> 00:04:03,635
Yeah, if you want to, the way that this works is you put yourself in the queue.

20
00:04:03,675 --> 00:04:10,557
And then when I put next on, that means that I can end up sort of choosing people in the order that they press their little mic button.

21
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:19,438
So I could also try to make it so that we could all just talk at once, but I'm going to have to get used to these new controls here.

22
00:04:19,498 --> 00:04:20,538
So thank you.

23
00:04:20,618 --> 00:04:22,079
The first thing that

24
00:04:23,599 --> 00:04:31,125
We are going to go over this session is the draft of the Medford City Council newsletter for October 2024.

25
00:04:32,286 --> 00:04:38,211
I ended up, I was the one who drafted this.

26
00:04:38,251 --> 00:04:44,156
It essentially just goes over everything that we've covered in the past month.

27
00:04:46,018 --> 00:04:47,339
I would like

28
00:04:48,603 --> 00:05:08,903
You know, I sent the meeting out, I sent the document out to all my colleagues prior to this, and just invited everybody to offer their comments as some folks are doing right now in this at the moment, like, even as we speak.

29
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:25,370
Councilor Sang, I would like to also draw your attention just to the governance committee, as well as Councilors Lazar and Callahan to the committees that you chair, just to be sure that the descriptions that I wrote for those are accurate.

30
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:34,635
So if you have any thoughts or questions or ways that you think things should be edited, feel free to let me know.

31
00:05:41,187 --> 00:05:46,449
Let's see.

32
00:05:46,609 --> 00:05:47,089
Sorry.

33
00:06:01,774 --> 00:06:04,095
Kevin, it says that her mic is on.

34
00:06:04,555 --> 00:06:04,955
Hold on.

35
00:06:06,715 --> 00:06:08,136
Here, but it's.

36
00:06:14,985 --> 00:06:15,746
In the chamber.

37
00:06:15,766 --> 00:06:16,446
Uh huh.

38
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:18,768
Oh, that's looking good.

39
00:06:18,968 --> 00:06:19,568
Yeah.

40
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:21,029
Tasty.

41
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:22,370
Um.

42
00:06:23,811 --> 00:06:28,975
Just there's a typo at the end of the first general business point and invest $4 million to invest.

43
00:06:54,334 --> 00:06:55,655
Councilor Lemming, if I may.

44
00:06:57,396 --> 00:06:58,596
Yes, Councilor Sang.

45
00:06:59,757 --> 00:07:05,020
I was just going to say, I realized I had notes on proposed edits to

46
00:07:06,587 --> 00:07:21,051
To the newsletter draft, I realized since I can't make it in person today, it'd be easier for me just to leave my comments as comments and suggestions for you guys to consider.

47
00:07:22,051 --> 00:07:31,874
I also see that there are folks here who are potentially here for the second agenda item, which we will not be discussing details of today.

48
00:07:33,294 --> 00:07:36,835
I'm just going to give a quick one-sentence summary when Chair Lehmann calls for it.

49
00:07:37,296 --> 00:07:43,838
We're going to, let's, I understand that we're just, I just want to do, finish editing the newsletter and then we will.

50
00:07:43,878 --> 00:07:55,462
I know, I just, it'll just take us like 20 minutes to edit and I don't want, it'll take us 20 minutes to edit it and I just don't want folks to be staying on longer than they want to be.

51
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:58,751
Okay.

52
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:00,512
So, all right.

53
00:08:00,552 --> 00:08:04,174
So if councillors, that's reasonable enough.

54
00:08:04,214 --> 00:08:20,464
If councillors would like to spend a little bit of time editing it while we go through Councillor Sang's presentation on the next agenda item, then feel free to do so.

55
00:08:20,484 --> 00:08:22,345
I understand that

56
00:08:23,792 --> 00:08:27,555
Due to some emails flying around, not everybody has been able to do so.

57
00:08:27,615 --> 00:08:44,748
But if Councilor Sang would like to offer a brief presentation on the state, on the Human Rights Commission, then as he wants to, then he can go.

58
00:08:44,908 --> 00:08:45,929
Then feel free to take it away.

59
00:08:47,482 --> 00:08:48,223
Thank you, Chair Lemmy.

60
00:08:48,263 --> 00:08:51,705
Presentation is very generous of a word, as I told you, Chair.

61
00:08:51,945 --> 00:08:54,467
I really don't have much of an update for this committee.

62
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,588
I'm still working through it.

63
00:08:58,129 --> 00:09:11,038
I sat down with the mayor and our DI director, Francis Wojciech, recently to talk through their ideas and potential disagreements on it.

64
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:16,662
They are still reviewing the draft that I shared with this committee.

65
00:09:17,722 --> 00:09:37,611
earlier in the year with some potential edits that they have told me that they would want to make, but it's very much still in conversation and I don't have anything for this committee right now or for the public.

66
00:09:38,571 --> 00:09:44,814
And I'll let everyone know once those edits are available, but they are currently not available.

67
00:09:50,626 --> 00:09:52,487
Thank you, Councilor Sang.

68
00:09:52,507 --> 00:10:03,691
So for the very brief update on the State of the Human Rights Commission, we will move on.

69
00:10:03,711 --> 00:10:07,633
Are there any other comments from Councilors?

70
00:10:07,653 --> 00:10:11,474
Okay, we'll move on to public comment.

71
00:10:11,574 --> 00:10:15,055
I see Steve Schnapp's hand raised on Zoom.

72
00:10:15,075 --> 00:10:16,276
I'm just gonna ask him to unmute.

73
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:19,399
Thank you.

74
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:24,585
I just was curious if the draft that Justin presented to the mayor.

75
00:10:26,007 --> 00:10:27,068
If that is available.

76
00:10:30,412 --> 00:10:31,794
No, that's, oh, sorry.

77
00:10:33,456 --> 00:10:34,497
No, no, go, go for it.

78
00:10:35,038 --> 00:10:35,859
Without that.

79
00:10:39,218 --> 00:10:41,579
Sorry, can you repeat that one more, once more?

80
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:48,684
I heard you say that you presented a draft to this committee and then met with the mayor.

81
00:10:50,945 --> 00:10:55,348
I presented that draft to the DI director and the mayor as well.

82
00:10:55,488 --> 00:11:04,313
And the DI director and I had worked on the same document.

83
00:11:05,657 --> 00:11:19,404
documents the director had put in some notes on potential discrepancy and that was sent to the mayor.

84
00:11:19,464 --> 00:11:20,385
Is that public record?

85
00:11:21,526 --> 00:11:21,626
No.

86
00:11:22,822 --> 00:11:28,065
Uh, but, but once the mayor sends back, um, any actual edits to the document.

87
00:11:28,165 --> 00:11:35,588
So right now there are no edits to the documents, no real edits documents that, um, presented to the committee.

88
00:11:35,988 --> 00:11:38,729
But, um, one air sends back to edits.

89
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:42,151
I will share them all with, uh, with the committee and with the public.

90
00:11:43,372 --> 00:11:43,652
Okay.

91
00:11:43,672 --> 00:11:43,992
Thank you.

92
00:11:51,184 --> 00:11:51,825
Thank you.

93
00:11:51,845 --> 00:11:55,846
Is there any other public comment?

94
00:11:57,346 --> 00:11:59,047
Anyone else who'd like to speak?

95
00:11:59,067 --> 00:12:03,788
All right.

96
00:12:04,709 --> 00:12:09,790
Seeing none, do we have a motion on the floor regarding this paper?

97
00:12:14,752 --> 00:12:16,993
Motion to keep the paper in committee and

98
00:12:20,336 --> 00:12:21,157
keep paper in committee.

99
00:12:22,238 --> 00:12:22,658
Second.

100
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:32,406
Motion by Councilor Lozaro to keep the paper in committee, seconded by Councilor Sang.

101
00:12:32,686 --> 00:12:35,028
Mr. Clerk, when you're ready, please call the roll.

102
00:12:35,048 --> 00:12:43,154
Councilor Lozaro?

103
00:12:43,535 --> 00:12:43,735
Yes.

104
00:12:44,495 --> 00:12:45,696
Councilor Scarpelli is absent.

105
00:12:47,197 --> 00:12:47,698
Councilor Sang?

106
00:12:50,049 --> 00:12:50,389
Yes.

107
00:12:51,289 --> 00:12:51,749
Chair Lemming.

108
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:56,851
Yes, for an affirmative, none absent, the motion passes.

109
00:13:00,932 --> 00:13:14,035
Would also like to note for the AV folks that there might need to be a better system for roll call in the future as well.

110
00:13:14,955 --> 00:13:18,336
So it's just kind of because it's good

111
00:13:21,129 --> 00:13:26,931
Yeah, it's better to be able to do it quickly instead of have everybody queue up each and every time.

112
00:13:27,111 --> 00:13:31,212
So there's kind of a note for the future with this new audio-visual system we have.

113
00:13:32,893 --> 00:13:38,834
But in any case, I'd like to thank everybody for attending for the brief update.

114
00:13:38,854 --> 00:13:43,336
And I hope that we'll be able to have something public as soon as we can on the Human Rights Commission.

115
00:13:48,510 --> 00:14:00,280
Moving back to the newsletter draft, which we can hopefully hammer out and set a record for pretty fast committee meeting.

116
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,702
I'm just going to share that once again to Zoom.

117
00:14:03,203 --> 00:14:03,363
Okay.

118
00:14:11,613 --> 00:14:19,098
So it looks like we just have a couple of typos, which are entirely my fault.

119
00:14:19,319 --> 00:14:21,120
So I'm just going to go ahead and accept a few of these.

120
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:24,542
Let's see.

121
00:14:27,004 --> 00:14:35,610
And if any counselor has anything in particular that they'd like to point out in the newsletter or discuss, then just feel free to raise your hand.

122
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,691
The counselor is saying, I see that your hand is raised.

123
00:14:38,272 --> 00:14:39,153
Is that from before?

124
00:14:39,273 --> 00:14:39,633
Oh, sorry.

125
00:14:39,653 --> 00:14:40,974
That was from before.

126
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:43,155
Okay, cool.

127
00:14:50,481 --> 00:14:50,641
Yep.

128
00:14:53,443 --> 00:14:54,404
Am I, I don't know.

129
00:14:54,424 --> 00:14:54,984
Yep, you're recognized.

130
00:14:55,004 --> 00:14:56,445
I don't know why I'm called on with the new system.

131
00:14:56,465 --> 00:14:58,307
Okay.

132
00:14:58,467 --> 00:14:58,747
Thank you.

133
00:14:58,827 --> 00:15:04,692
I just wanted to, via email through the clerk, I had

134
00:15:05,498 --> 00:15:10,884
mentioned something about the links being embedded for neatness.

135
00:15:11,865 --> 00:15:14,948
I was told that all the links would be embedded, which is great.

136
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:21,235
And I have already reviewed the sections on the committees.

137
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:22,035
They look good to me.

138
00:15:22,596 --> 00:15:25,839
So thank you for your work on this.

139
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,042
The links I put there solely to

140
00:15:30,882 --> 00:15:40,926
The links I put there mainly to just help myself later when I go into latech and create it and format it myself.

141
00:15:43,587 --> 00:15:45,747
I've looked through everything and it looks good.

142
00:15:45,767 --> 00:15:53,330
I know that Councillor Sang is updating just the governance committee one, but I think my committee is good and the rest of it looks good to me.

143
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:54,951
So thank you so much for putting it together.

144
00:15:55,611 --> 00:15:55,991
Thank you.

145
00:15:57,429 --> 00:16:04,032
And I'm just going through this through and accepting Councilor Sang's edits.

146
00:16:05,813 --> 00:16:16,118
It's clear that Harvard Law student is much better at editing texts than a very tired scientist.

147
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,400
Unequally tired.

148
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:24,863
A very tired Harvard Law student is clearly better with the English language.

149
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:35,240
Excuse me as I just try to find the words for this one point.

150
00:16:45,965 --> 00:16:54,269
All right, that looks... Wait, Councilor Sang, is this comment that I'm seeing here...

151
00:16:56,158 --> 00:16:59,340
Yeah, that's a proposed edit to what's there.

152
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,222
You can see if you prefer it.

153
00:17:01,522 --> 00:17:07,686
I just think it's a little bit more organized and more formal in tone.

154
00:17:07,987 --> 00:17:12,150
But I'll let the committee discuss it since it's a bigger edit.

155
00:17:19,295 --> 00:17:19,675
OK.

156
00:17:24,879 --> 00:17:25,099
Cool.

157
00:17:30,672 --> 00:17:32,853
I like the suggested edit a lot.

158
00:17:33,113 --> 00:17:33,433
Thank you.

159
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:34,294
Cool.

160
00:17:38,575 --> 00:17:38,996
All right.

161
00:17:39,216 --> 00:17:56,143
And I understand that I was trying to remember that meeting following the four hours and 42 minute Q&A session, which of the resolutions from the October 15th meeting we tabled.

162
00:17:56,323 --> 00:17:59,504
And I asked the clerk earlier, and he said that

163
00:18:00,643 --> 00:18:14,647
According to his memory, we did not table the commemoration of Sarah Bradley Fulton Day, but we did table the commemoration of the two DPW staff members who returned a lost wallet for the next regular meeting.

164
00:18:14,667 --> 00:18:16,108
Is that correct?

165
00:18:17,748 --> 00:18:26,851
I know about the lost wallet on this table, but I would have to check the records for the notes for the records to see about the other one.

166
00:18:27,251 --> 00:18:29,212
I think it was passed, but I'm not entirely sure.

167
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:44,466
Um, at the commemorations and acknowledgement section, uh, we, I put the, I put the two, uh, commemorations from the October 15th meeting in there, but we tabled a couple of stuff really, really quickly.

168
00:18:44,506 --> 00:18:49,448
And I was having trouble remembering exactly which ones we table and which ones we very quickly passed.

169
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:54,650
So, um, I would, do you want me to run down and check?

170
00:18:59,089 --> 00:19:00,750
We passed Sarah Bradley Fulton.

171
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:10,356
We tabled the commemoration of the DPW workers that will be discussed, I believe, at the next October meeting on Tuesday.

172
00:19:12,197 --> 00:19:22,543
Just because it was so late and we didn't want to give it short shrift, but Sarah Bradley Fulton was coming up that next weekend, so we needed to make sure it was happening.

173
00:19:30,373 --> 00:19:33,716
Can we just, how do we make these all just so that people can unmute themselves?

174
00:19:33,996 --> 00:19:34,457
How do we?

175
00:19:36,939 --> 00:19:39,181
No, no, I mean, this is just a regular time.

176
00:19:39,341 --> 00:19:44,426
Yeah, just, didn't we also have that commemoration of Larry Lepore?

177
00:19:44,966 --> 00:19:49,651
But I'm wondering, do we, in the past, we've left those off of this.

178
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:59,737
I think that is accurate that we have not put in like the personal ones about, you know, I started so I started I started doing that because I figured it was it was nice.

179
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:05,242
So, in the, you know, in some of the earlier ones we might have accidentally left off.

180
00:20:06,403 --> 00:20:25,616
a couple of them or not put all of them on there especially because the initial one was covering a four-month period and it was pretty lengthy as it was but um I think I think moving forward it's probably it would just be nice to show people um who and all was commemorated at these these different meetings.

181
00:20:25,856 --> 00:20:27,958
We'll want to put Larry Lepore in here.

182
00:20:27,978 --> 00:20:28,178
Sorry?

183
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:28,958
Larry Lepore.

184
00:20:36,952 --> 00:20:37,933
When was that passed?

185
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:07,072
What date was Larry's passing?

186
00:21:09,073 --> 00:21:11,735
Really?

187
00:21:11,755 --> 00:21:12,976
Okay.

188
00:21:14,096 --> 00:21:15,417
Resolution on our suspension.

189
00:21:15,877 --> 00:21:16,238
Yeah.

190
00:21:16,378 --> 00:21:22,322
It's hard for me to find the records of the ones I can get the date.

191
00:21:22,342 --> 00:21:22,482
Yeah.

192
00:21:22,802 --> 00:21:27,785
I mean, I know that the date of the resolution was the 15th, but hang on, give me a second.

193
00:21:28,786 --> 00:21:32,849
Well, the date of the resolution would have been the 15th, but the date of his passing.

194
00:21:34,673 --> 00:21:34,933
Yep.

195
00:21:35,733 --> 00:21:35,933
OK.

196
00:21:35,993 --> 00:21:36,353
October 14.

197
00:21:36,453 --> 00:21:36,853
OK.

198
00:21:44,795 --> 00:21:46,796
Does this seem like an appropriate addition?

199
00:21:46,816 --> 00:21:52,197
OK.

200
00:21:57,058 --> 00:21:57,338
Great.

201
00:21:57,638 --> 00:22:00,998
Do we have a motion on the floor?

202
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,000
Chairman.

203
00:22:07,281 --> 00:22:08,501
Was that a second councilor saying?

204
00:22:09,681 --> 00:22:10,222
That's a second.

205
00:22:10,282 --> 00:22:14,283
I just wanted to note that I put in a few more, just small edits.

206
00:22:14,663 --> 00:22:20,904
None of them are really to the content besides there's something small at the end, the residents guide.

207
00:22:20,944 --> 00:22:23,385
I just kind of like spelled it out.

208
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:24,125
Okay.

209
00:22:24,165 --> 00:22:26,146
All right.

210
00:22:27,806 --> 00:22:30,007
I'm just going through and looking at it and accepting.

211
00:22:31,668 --> 00:22:34,189
And I actually do have one like to me.

212
00:22:34,289 --> 00:22:36,170
This seems grammatically awkward.

213
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:49,056
This section that I like we started discussions on the city charter review process, including setting a timeline as we expect the Charter Review Committee's recommendations to like to me there has to be an ending to that sentence, but.

214
00:22:51,117 --> 00:22:55,760
I think grammatically this is correct, but I yeah, it does read awkwardly.

215
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:58,081
We can edit it.

216
00:23:00,626 --> 00:23:05,549
I'm not sure what you mean as we expect them to continue to arrive or as we expect.

217
00:23:05,749 --> 00:23:09,332
Well, as just signifies that two things are happening at the same time.

218
00:23:10,232 --> 00:23:19,839
So we do expect the CRC's recommendations, but we can say to as we expect to receive.

219
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:21,840
Yes, thank you.

220
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:38,211
public vote in.

221
00:23:39,092 --> 00:23:39,352
Okay.

222
00:24:07,461 --> 00:24:11,702
I move to approve and send to, just to approve.

223
00:24:12,582 --> 00:24:17,323
Motion by Councilor Callahan to approve and release.

224
00:24:17,343 --> 00:24:18,064
Do we have a second?

225
00:24:19,184 --> 00:24:21,424
Seconded by Councilor Lozaro.

226
00:24:21,825 --> 00:24:24,605

227
00:24:33,627 --> 00:24:34,308

00:24:34,388 --> 00:24:34,648
Yes.

229
00:24:34,908 --> 00:24:35,608

Councilor Singh?

232
00:24:39,688 --> 00:24:39,888
Yes.

233
00:24:40,768 --> 00:24:41,188
Chair Lemming?

234
00:24:41,408 --> 00:24:41,669
Yes.

235
00:24:42,349 --> 00:24:44,370
Four in the affirmative, one absent.

236
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:49,313
The motion passes and we have another newsletter.

237
00:24:50,553 --> 00:24:52,875
Do we have any other motions on the floor?

238
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:53,955
Motion to adjourn.

239
00:24:55,316 --> 00:24:55,636
Second.

240
00:24:55,976 --> 00:24:56,557
Seconded by?

Yes.

245
00:25:14,569 --> 00:25:15,390
Councilor Lazaro.

246
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:15,750

Yes.

250

Chair Lemmon.
