1
00:00:00,771 --> 00:00:06,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome everyone to the August 1st, 2024 meeting of the Medford Charter Study Committee.

2
00:00:06,575 --> 00:00:09,937
[SPEAKER_02]: We're welcoming the Collins Center tonight.

3
00:00:09,997 --> 00:00:16,100
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Anthony, Frank, and Marilyn, which is great because we have a lot of material to go through.

4
00:00:17,701 --> 00:00:23,144
[SPEAKER_02]: First, I just want to deal with the minutes from June 20th.

5
00:00:23,164 --> 00:00:24,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Did anyone have a chance to look at them?

6
00:00:26,217 --> 00:00:27,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Any issues?

7
00:00:28,398 --> 00:00:28,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Melva?

8
00:00:29,219 --> 00:00:29,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes?

9
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:32,780
[SPEAKER_04]: It says my video won't start because you've stopped it.

10
00:00:33,341 --> 00:00:33,741
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

11
00:00:34,621 --> 00:00:35,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Hang on.

12
00:00:36,282 --> 00:00:38,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me check on that.

13
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:44,947
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, here we go.

14
00:00:45,367 --> 00:00:46,748
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, you should be able to start it now.

15
00:00:47,428 --> 00:00:48,329
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, yeah.

16
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:51,650
[SPEAKER_02]: And thanks for actually just reminding me that I need to record the meeting.

17
00:00:53,391 --> 00:00:54,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Recording in progress.

18
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:56,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody from the public?

19
00:00:58,651 --> 00:00:59,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Not yet.

20
00:01:00,191 --> 00:01:00,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

21
00:01:00,711 --> 00:01:01,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Frances had her hand raised.

22
00:01:03,852 --> 00:01:04,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Frances.

23
00:01:07,492 --> 00:01:07,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

24
00:01:08,772 --> 00:01:09,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you want to say something?

25
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:11,893
[SPEAKER_02]: It was to remind you to record.

26
00:01:12,093 --> 00:01:13,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

27
00:01:13,513 --> 00:01:13,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

28
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:15,114
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you.

29
00:01:15,814 --> 00:01:16,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, great.

30
00:01:16,814 --> 00:01:18,854
[SPEAKER_02]: So the minutes, did everyone have a chance to look at them?

31
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:21,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have any changes?

32
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:22,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we good with them?

33
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, they're good.

34
00:01:25,412 --> 00:01:26,753
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll make a motion to accept.

35
00:01:28,654 --> 00:01:29,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, all in favor?

36
00:01:30,456 --> 00:01:31,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

37
00:01:32,777 --> 00:01:40,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so our first item is Eunice is going to give a report from the Financial Reporting Ethics Subcommittee.

38
00:01:41,644 --> 00:01:42,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Eunice, it's all you.

39
00:01:43,521 --> 00:01:51,947
[SPEAKER_07]: Okie dokie, so in a meeting back in June, I think it was our 3rd meeting in June.

40
00:01:51,967 --> 00:01:55,169
[SPEAKER_07]: We were going through the charter.

41
00:01:55,209 --> 00:01:56,030
[SPEAKER_07]: We talked about.

42
00:01:57,611 --> 00:02:01,333
[SPEAKER_07]: An ethics component to the charter, and that was kind of brought up.

43
00:02:01,954 --> 00:02:09,119
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I discovered that Framingham has an ethics component in their charter.

44
00:02:09,819 --> 00:02:36,332
[SPEAKER_07]: So after we did a whole lot of discussion back then, we decided that we would form a subcommittee and we were charged with investigating whether or not we should add a section in Article 9 regarding ethics and specifically to require statements of financial interest or statements of financial disclosure from members of our municipal government.

45
00:02:38,743 --> 00:02:46,365
[SPEAKER_07]: We did some research, which included finding other communities that dealt with ethics in some form.

46
00:02:46,385 --> 00:02:52,466
[SPEAKER_07]: And after looking at a few dozen charters and ordinances, we found the following.

47
00:02:53,666 --> 00:03:02,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Framingham is the only community that we could find that includes ethics in the charter via an ordinance.

48
00:03:03,685 --> 00:03:11,713
[SPEAKER_07]: Boston, Cambridge, Somerville, and Springfield have ordinances that involve ethics with their municipal government.

49
00:03:12,433 --> 00:03:18,019
[SPEAKER_07]: And Somerville and Springfield have ethics commissions that they establish by ordinance.

50
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,604
[SPEAKER_07]: I reached out to representatives from Framingham, Cambridge, and Springfield.

51
00:03:23,624 --> 00:03:27,508
[SPEAKER_07]: I was only able to connect with somebody from Framingham.

52
00:03:30,575 --> 00:03:45,706
[SPEAKER_07]: But in lieu of conversations, yikes, with representatives from other communities, we had a set of questions and I tried to summarize them, which I will do very shortly.

53
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:56,774
[SPEAKER_07]: But everything that I came across, any conversation, any documentation, you'll find it all in the ethics subcommittee on our drive.

54
00:03:58,674 --> 00:04:06,298
[SPEAKER_07]: So, as we know, per mass general law, statements of financial disclosure are not required at the municipal level.

55
00:04:06,638 --> 00:04:08,298
[SPEAKER_07]: They are required at the state level.

56
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:16,222
[SPEAKER_07]: And there is a form at the state level that electives and employees have to complete.

57
00:04:16,702 --> 00:04:17,983
[SPEAKER_07]: It's 42 pages long.

58
00:04:18,995 --> 00:04:28,024
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very thorough, very intrusive, not only on the individual, but it goes into family business as well.

59
00:04:28,044 --> 00:04:33,569
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a long conversation with a gentleman by the name of George King.

60
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:39,275
[SPEAKER_07]: He's the city counselor at large in Framingham who was involved in writing their charter.

61
00:04:41,026 --> 00:04:55,313
[SPEAKER_07]: In 2016, they converted from a town to a city, and their first charter went into effect on January 1st, 2018, and it's now undergoing its first review at the five-year mark.

62
00:04:57,154 --> 00:05:05,359
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. King from Framingham told me that he believed that having an ethics requirement in the charter is the right approach.

63
00:05:06,527 --> 00:05:17,336
[SPEAKER_07]: a charter requirement compels the city council to establish an ordinance rather than a recommendation, which he saw as very weak.

64
00:05:18,077 --> 00:05:27,905
[SPEAKER_07]: They, Framingham Charter Commission, I guess, didn't have much faith in their city council that they would do anything on their own without a mandate.

65
00:05:29,365 --> 00:05:30,146
[SPEAKER_07]: being in the charter.

66
00:05:31,067 --> 00:05:38,071
[SPEAKER_07]: What he did say, however, they use the state form, the 42-pager, and he found that to be an impediment.

67
00:05:39,832 --> 00:05:43,215
[SPEAKER_07]: Too long, too intrusive, not Framingham-centric.

68
00:05:44,115 --> 00:05:58,365
[SPEAKER_07]: He suggested that a shorter form, more targeted to the community, would be more effective and better able to highlight any possible conflicts or issues at the local level.

69
00:06:01,035 --> 00:06:05,139
[SPEAKER_07]: We had a series of things that we wanted to know.

70
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:19,213
[SPEAKER_07]: So from my research from all of the different communities that I was able to delve into either via the charter or via ordinance, we found out the following.

71
00:06:20,234 --> 00:06:21,796
[SPEAKER_07]: The question we asked was,

72
00:06:23,724 --> 00:06:28,087
[SPEAKER_07]: Who is required to complete the statements of financial interest?

73
00:06:29,127 --> 00:06:35,471
[SPEAKER_07]: And every community that we looked at, except Somerville, requires candidates and electeds.

74
00:06:36,552 --> 00:06:38,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Somerville only requires their electeds.

75
00:06:40,955 --> 00:06:43,677
[SPEAKER_07]: All the communities required their department heads.

76
00:06:45,331 --> 00:06:48,574
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, regarding boards and commissions kind of varied.

77
00:06:49,335 --> 00:06:51,657
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, some did not require any at all.

78
00:06:52,517 --> 00:07:10,393
[SPEAKER_07]: Others, anybody who was on a board or commission that received any sort of compensation and then yet others who were on boards or commissions that had some sort of permitting or regulatory power, zoning, licensing, something like that.

79
00:07:10,413 --> 00:07:10,453
[SPEAKER_07]: Um,

80
00:07:12,962 --> 00:07:23,345
[SPEAKER_07]: We asked Mr. King if it discouraged candidates for office or to sit on boards or applicants for city jobs, and he didn't think it did at all.

81
00:07:25,986 --> 00:07:28,647
[SPEAKER_07]: As I said, Framingham uses the state form.

82
00:07:29,227 --> 00:07:30,847
[SPEAKER_07]: Cambridge has their own form.

83
00:07:30,987 --> 00:07:35,008
[SPEAKER_07]: It's six pages long, and it only targets dealings with Cambridge.

84
00:07:37,947 --> 00:07:50,230
[SPEAKER_07]: In the various communities, either the city clerk or the elections commission was responsible for the oversight of the forums, distributing them, collecting them, auditing them for compliance.

85
00:07:52,511 --> 00:08:04,574
[SPEAKER_07]: And if a citizen wanted to investigate them, all they needed to do was go into the office and ask to see whichever one they wanted to see.

86
00:08:06,372 --> 00:08:14,317
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, we did find out that both Somerville and Springfield have ordinances that require the establishment of an ethics commission.

87
00:08:14,337 --> 00:08:24,964
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and, uh, those commissions are, uh, responsible for administering and overseeing, um, the statement of financial disclosure requirement.

88
00:08:26,264 --> 00:08:35,010
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, the, the, those ethics commissions modeled themselves after the state level ethics commission that exists.

89
00:08:38,154 --> 00:08:43,217
[SPEAKER_07]: Maury was charged with speaking with some of our current and past elected officials.

90
00:08:44,938 --> 00:08:53,884
[SPEAKER_07]: And he did that, and they responded that they felt that the required campaign finance reports are sufficient.

91
00:08:54,965 --> 00:08:58,507
[SPEAKER_07]: They felt that anything else would discourage potential candidates.

92
00:09:00,169 --> 00:09:13,735
[SPEAKER_07]: Campaign finance reports itemize every donation and expense for candidates for local office, but they are not as comprehensive as an annual financial statement.

93
00:09:15,676 --> 00:09:27,481
[SPEAKER_07]: The campaign finance reports for the last several elections here in Medford can be found on the elections tab on the Medford website if anybody's interested in taking a look.

94
00:09:30,451 --> 00:09:40,519
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, we did note that the communities that have some sort of an ethics component to the charter or via ordinance are currently bigger than Medford.

95
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:45,984
[SPEAKER_07]: Medford's population, as we know, is about 60,000, but we're growing.

96
00:09:47,385 --> 00:09:53,049
[SPEAKER_07]: There's several housing developments in stages of the pipeline that are

97
00:09:55,191 --> 00:10:00,353
[SPEAKER_07]: going to be 300 units, 400 units coming online in a few years.

98
00:10:00,373 --> 00:10:05,195
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a whole development coming down in the Wellington area possibly.

99
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:06,396
[SPEAKER_07]: We're growing too.

100
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:06,616
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

101
00:10:12,377 --> 00:10:25,345
[SPEAKER_07]: We talked about including in the charter, a mandate to the city council to create an ordinance requiring the statement of financial disclosure.

102
00:10:26,991 --> 00:10:30,393
[SPEAKER_07]: and or establishing an ethics commission.

103
00:10:31,434 --> 00:10:54,370
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a number of questions that we would need to take a look at if we wanted to go that route and whether or not we determine the parameters such as who would need to file them and how often or anything like that versus the city council would be charged with figuring all that out.

104
00:10:55,713 --> 00:10:58,835
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, we talked about establishing an ethics commission.

105
00:10:59,836 --> 00:11:07,961
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, ethics, you know, we talked about as being a pretty big word and it's, you know, more than finance.

106
00:11:08,722 --> 00:11:15,867
[SPEAKER_07]: So, an ethics, what an ethics commission does, its purpose would have to be, uh, defined.

107
00:11:16,787 --> 00:11:20,290
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, that could be modeled after the Springfield and some of the ones.

108
00:11:21,275 --> 00:11:31,942
[SPEAKER_07]: And whoever was doing the defining either us, or the city council could follow their lead or just.

109
00:11:31,963 --> 00:11:38,207
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the word I want just confine it to dealing with the statements of financial disclosure.

110
00:11:39,442 --> 00:11:52,600
[SPEAKER_07]: So kind of wrapping it all up, our end result of the two meetings that we had and all of our discussion and research, we arrived at the following recommendations.

111
00:11:54,363 --> 00:11:55,484
[SPEAKER_07]: We do one of the following.

112
00:11:56,597 --> 00:12:09,808
[SPEAKER_07]: We either put a provision in the charter for an ordinance to require elected officials, candidates for elected office, and some city officials to file annual financial statements.

113
00:12:11,249 --> 00:12:20,497
[SPEAKER_07]: And then if we were to do that, we could require an ordinance instituting the creation of an ethics commission.

114
00:12:22,077 --> 00:12:46,280
[SPEAKER_07]: If we decide that we didn't want to do that, we could recommend in our final report that the city council pass an ordinance requiring the annual financial statements be implemented by the ethics commission or recommend that the city council pass an ordinance to form an ethics commission.

115
00:12:47,377 --> 00:12:50,918
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep in mind, recommendations are just that.

116
00:12:50,938 --> 00:13:15,383
[SPEAKER_07]: The city council can ignore any recommendation we make in the charter versus if the charter were to pass, then the current council and any future councils would be compelled to require those statements of financial disclosure or require an ethics commission.

117
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:24,605
[SPEAKER_07]: That is where we got and what we would need to be voting on.

118
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:28,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Eunice.

119
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,351
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a great summary.

120
00:13:32,712 --> 00:13:42,880
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to give this a bit of discussion, but it's going to be very short because we have a lot of material to get through before we just take the first vote.

121
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Does anybody have any questions?

122
00:13:45,142 --> 00:13:45,342
[SPEAKER_02]: Ron?

123
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:50,367
[SPEAKER_11]: Has the Collins Center reviewed this information?

124
00:13:50,387 --> 00:13:56,589
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be great to hear from the Collins Center on this.

125
00:13:56,649 --> 00:14:07,892
[SPEAKER_11]: The reason I'm asking is because I'd love to know if none of this, we took action on none of this, how do the Massachusetts general laws enforce ethics at this level?

126
00:14:09,818 --> 00:14:12,679
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so, uh, well, I'll make one point.

127
00:14:12,699 --> 00:14:19,060
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um, Marilyn, who's on the call actually, uh, worked on, uh, Framingham when they first created their charter.

128
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,701
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we were both on a team during the second round as they're doing their charter review.

129
00:14:23,141 --> 00:14:27,662
[SPEAKER_09]: So Marilyn, if you want to, if you want to add any comments on that, uh, section arriving into the charter.

130
00:14:27,682 --> 00:14:38,245
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, I, well, I think a lot of it related to changing to a city form and having candidates for, um,

131
00:14:38,857 --> 00:14:42,680
[SPEAKER_13]: for council and mayor, which they had never had before.

132
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:49,145
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was thought to be a reasonable safeguard for them starting out.

133
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:56,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

134
00:14:58,152 --> 00:15:01,174
[SPEAKER_02]: And what about Ron's question about mass general laws?

135
00:15:05,298 --> 00:15:05,458
[SPEAKER_09]: So

136
00:15:07,508 --> 00:15:20,214
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that we wrote, I'm sorry, I think that we've written this in our opinion to you, to the committee in the past, but there are certain things like sort of the disclosure of, well, let me back up.

137
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:25,737
[SPEAKER_09]: There's not always in state law a requirement that you sort of do a written disclosure on

138
00:15:26,917 --> 00:15:31,160
[SPEAKER_09]: every type of relationship, but there are ethics requirements that you can't vote on.

139
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:36,444
[SPEAKER_09]: If we're talking about elected officials, that you can't vote on something that you or a family member may have a pecuniary interest in.

140
00:15:36,464 --> 00:15:48,393
[SPEAKER_09]: And there are certain, I don't have them all sort of listed off in front of me, but there are disclosure requirements for candidates and existing elected officials that go in different ways.

141
00:15:49,595 --> 00:15:51,096
[SPEAKER_09]: They sort of arrive in different levels.

142
00:15:51,917 --> 00:16:03,147
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think our perspective as articulate is that a lot of this is covered in state law, but some communities have chosen to incorporate, I guess you would say, an extra layer of protection.

143
00:16:04,868 --> 00:16:05,729
[SPEAKER_09]: We recommend.

144
00:16:08,946 --> 00:16:28,970
[SPEAKER_09]: We recommend that it doesn't necessarily have to be in your charter, and one of the reasons for that, and I think this, someone kind of alluded to this in the conversation with Framingham, is that it's easier to, there was a question from, I think it was Framingham, about that they're using the state ethics forms and that that's not Framingham specific.

145
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:30,470
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that was what I heard.

146
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,790
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's correct, Anthony.

147
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:36,531
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. King said a more targeted form would be better.

148
00:16:37,133 --> 00:16:43,836
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and so to change that, because it's in their chart and that would require a charter change, and I don't think I'm talking about school.

149
00:16:44,356 --> 00:16:53,540
[SPEAKER_09]: When we were helping their charter commission this last time, they didn't really talk about their, we didn't spend a lot of time on their ethics, on the ethics provision.

150
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,942
[SPEAKER_09]: Now it's not, hasn't fully passed their council yet, so they may amend it in the future, but.

151
00:16:58,952 --> 00:17:06,698
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm saying it's a larger process to change something that's in the charter versus making something that will work for the community in an ordinance.

152
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:14,644
[SPEAKER_09]: So our only point is that we don't, our current position is that it may not rise to the level of being in the charter, so.

153
00:17:18,067 --> 00:17:19,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, any other questions?

154
00:17:25,727 --> 00:17:31,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I want to take it to a vote, but first, I'm going to ask if there's any members of the public that would like to speak on this.

155
00:17:40,512 --> 00:17:41,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

156
00:17:41,232 --> 00:17:53,256
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to start by just voting on whether this is something that we would want to include in the chart.

157
00:17:56,102 --> 00:18:16,030
[SPEAKER_02]: So the vote is, do we put a provision in the charter that would require the city council to pass an ordinance that would require financial statements, annual financial statements from elected officials, candidates, and some city officials?

158
00:18:17,031 --> 00:18:21,433
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's- Can I stop you for a second because I was on mute and I was trying to ask a question.

159
00:18:21,453 --> 00:18:22,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm sorry.

160
00:18:22,493 --> 00:18:23,354
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's my fault.

161
00:18:23,374 --> 00:18:23,874
[SPEAKER_02]: I was on mute.

162
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:24,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

163
00:18:24,695 --> 00:18:25,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead.

164
00:18:26,156 --> 00:18:43,086
[SPEAKER_04]: So Eunice, you said that in talking to someone, they said that this is not, and I probably have this a little backward, but I got the gist that you were saying that the person you were speaking to said, well, you shouldn't do this because it'd be too much work.

165
00:18:43,106 --> 00:18:46,408
[SPEAKER_04]: People don't want to do this job.

166
00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:47,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that what you said?

167
00:18:47,829 --> 00:18:48,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I correct about that?

168
00:18:49,761 --> 00:19:00,127
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, what I got from the only person that I was able to actually speak to, um, despite trying other communities was, um, uh, George King in Framingham.

169
00:19:00,147 --> 00:19:08,552
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, he didn't, he hadn't heard anyone say that it was any sort of an impediment in any way.

170
00:19:08,572 --> 00:19:16,677
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and I did ask him directly, um, Maury did talk to, um, some of our, um,

171
00:19:17,737 --> 00:19:38,762
[SPEAKER_07]: past electeds, and maybe he can certainly say it better than I, but they felt that the campaign finance reports that they are required to do throughout the time of an election was sufficient.

172
00:19:39,362 --> 00:19:42,983
[SPEAKER_07]: In my view, I feel like they're two different things.

173
00:19:44,244 --> 00:19:44,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Why is that?

174
00:19:46,131 --> 00:19:54,916
[SPEAKER_07]: The campaign finance reports, and I invite anybody to go onto the city website at their leisure and take a look at them.

175
00:19:55,957 --> 00:20:09,545
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you gave $100 to your favorite candidate last election, your name would be listed on that, or anybody else that gave $50 or more to their favorite candidate.

176
00:20:11,826 --> 00:20:16,709
[SPEAKER_07]: And it also lists any expenses or anything as well that the candidate incurred.

177
00:20:17,069 --> 00:20:30,217
[SPEAKER_07]: There are campaign finance laws that, you know, you can only give so much, I think it's corporations and businesses and so forth, to a candidate.

178
00:20:31,118 --> 00:20:34,740
[SPEAKER_07]: But to me, what I think a statement of financial disclosure would

179
00:20:37,464 --> 00:20:51,688
[SPEAKER_07]: would be if anybody had their, you know, had any sort of stock in a local development coming or a business or anything that, you know, might have, you know,

180
00:20:52,813 --> 00:21:07,250
[SPEAKER_07]: Business with the city, you know, and kind of looking at it from the elected official aspect, somebody that might be pushing for approval of a development, because maybe they have some.

181
00:21:08,723 --> 00:21:21,433
[SPEAKER_07]: financial interest in it, or, you know, a liquor license or, or, or something, you know, so I feel like, I feel like they do two different things.

182
00:21:21,953 --> 00:21:30,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so would the impediment be that people would not want to engage because they may have to disclose too much information?

183
00:21:31,929 --> 00:21:33,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Or is it too much work?

184
00:21:33,189 --> 00:21:34,210
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I'm trying to.

185
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:36,390
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's mine.

186
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,751
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have the clarity on this, Eunice.

187
00:21:39,491 --> 00:21:41,732
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why I'm asking.

188
00:21:43,032 --> 00:21:49,273
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we sort of explored both angles of that.

189
00:21:50,514 --> 00:21:53,375
[SPEAKER_07]: And as I said, unfortunately, we're not able to.

190
00:21:56,014 --> 00:22:10,243
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, talk to too many people, or at least, you know, talk to 2 city counselors about this and both said that they wouldn't consider either the privacy issue or the work of creating a statement to be an impediment.

191
00:22:10,703 --> 00:22:14,185
[SPEAKER_13]: For them, they wouldn't they wouldn't correct.

192
00:22:14,738 --> 00:22:15,178
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

193
00:22:15,879 --> 00:22:19,682
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to just throw out a question to the Collins Center.

194
00:22:20,162 --> 00:22:34,493
[SPEAKER_02]: The issues that were just being described about, say, an elected official pushing something because they had an interest in a development company or a liquor store or whatever, those are already prohibited by state law.

195
00:22:34,533 --> 00:22:35,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that correct?

196
00:22:36,495 --> 00:22:37,095
[SPEAKER_09]: That is correct.

197
00:22:37,635 --> 00:22:37,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

198
00:22:38,076 --> 00:22:39,057
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want that to be clear.

199
00:22:39,137 --> 00:22:41,198
[SPEAKER_09]: Paper play, like quid pro quo, that's correct.

200
00:22:41,739 --> 00:22:42,059
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

201
00:22:43,372 --> 00:22:54,195
[SPEAKER_00]: So that being said, they're prohibited by state law, but I think something like this, what it would add was it would make it easy to tell if they were doing it, right?

202
00:22:54,215 --> 00:23:04,058
[SPEAKER_00]: Because at the moment, in spite of the fact that it's prohibited, there's no way for the public or a prosecutor even to necessarily easily find out, oh, they do actually have a financial stake in this.

203
00:23:04,698 --> 00:23:05,378
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that would.

204
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:07,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, David.

205
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:08,639
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to clarify that.

206
00:23:11,907 --> 00:23:14,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, wait a minute, I'm confused again.

207
00:23:14,288 --> 00:23:17,908
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's state law, how do we not know?

208
00:23:18,949 --> 00:23:35,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they don't, they're prohibited by law from doing that, but they're not required, local officials are not required to submit annual financial reports, so maybe they could try to get away with it, I guess is the... And I'm going to have to apologize because I cut into Paulette's time.

209
00:23:35,493 --> 00:23:36,313
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, Paulette.

210
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:36,833
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay.

211
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:37,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Paulette, go ahead.

212
00:23:40,294 --> 00:23:40,834
[SPEAKER_04]: You're on mute.

213
00:23:40,934 --> 00:23:41,794
[SPEAKER_02]: You're on mute, Paulette.

214
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:56,154
[SPEAKER_03]: I wondered whether this would include if I was running for school committee, theoretically, would I then have to disclose my spouse's holdings?

215
00:23:56,355 --> 00:24:00,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, how does that work?

216
00:24:02,037 --> 00:24:09,420
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the question is, whose business is it whether we have $50,000 worth of stock in, you know, AT&T?

217
00:24:12,026 --> 00:24:14,688
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it would depend upon the form.

218
00:24:14,748 --> 00:24:25,916
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the state form, like we discussed back in June and David said it rather eloquently, you're showing the color of your underwear.

219
00:24:26,336 --> 00:24:29,178
[SPEAKER_07]: You're divulging everything.

220
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:35,102
[SPEAKER_07]: The state form is 42 pages long and it leaves nothing to the imagination.

221
00:24:35,122 --> 00:24:37,004
[SPEAKER_07]: Including spouses.

222
00:24:37,824 --> 00:24:39,766
[SPEAKER_07]: Including your spouse and your adult children.

223
00:24:42,174 --> 00:24:47,137
[SPEAKER_07]: The Cambridge form that I looked at is much more targeted.

224
00:24:47,157 --> 00:25:06,410
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't recall if it involved spouse or not, but I suspect that if your spouse had an interest in a liquor store that was coming before the Liquor Commission or a development that was being built on Main Street, then yeah.

225
00:25:10,673 --> 00:25:13,057
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you own $50,000 worth of stock in widgets incorporated, it doesn't matter.

226
00:25:13,077 --> 00:25:14,279
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's more how it directs.

227
00:25:22,185 --> 00:25:29,450
[SPEAKER_07]: how it relates directly to Medford is the key.

228
00:25:29,951 --> 00:25:33,733
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically, it would depend on however the form looks.

229
00:25:34,154 --> 00:25:34,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

230
00:25:34,414 --> 00:25:42,840
[SPEAKER_03]: So creating that form really would be extremely important in terms of figuring out what lines to draw.

231
00:25:43,881 --> 00:25:44,121
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

232
00:25:44,481 --> 00:25:49,765
[SPEAKER_07]: And I suspect that that would be up to the city council.

233
00:25:53,336 --> 00:25:56,858
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's not our job to create a form like that.

234
00:25:57,178 --> 00:26:06,143
[SPEAKER_02]: We would be putting a requirement that they pass an ordinance which could say that the state form is used.

235
00:26:06,203 --> 00:26:08,524
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that's what Framingham said.

236
00:26:08,744 --> 00:26:12,306
[SPEAKER_02]: But it doesn't seem like we want to do that based on this discussion.

237
00:26:13,587 --> 00:26:13,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Maury.

238
00:26:15,767 --> 00:26:22,836
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad Paul had so much said, because if you recall in our committee meetings, she almost echoed everything that I had said.

239
00:26:22,876 --> 00:26:26,500
[SPEAKER_06]: Number one, we're talking about the municipal level here.

240
00:26:27,902 --> 00:26:31,667
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to involve spouses, adult children, and so forth.

241
00:26:33,428 --> 00:26:56,503
[SPEAKER_06]: Under full disclosure, I'm going to use a Unisys example that if someone's going for a liquor store and I have a 20% ownership, number one, I have to be included on the ABCC and any monies that were contributed to this corporation to establish this, you're already on there.

242
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,524
[SPEAKER_06]: I just think...

243
00:27:00,026 --> 00:27:07,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we said before, that I think something to the city council would be suffice if we want to go that far.

244
00:27:08,032 --> 00:27:13,135
[SPEAKER_06]: I just think we're going way too deep on this thing on a municipal level.

245
00:27:14,096 --> 00:27:15,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you.

246
00:27:15,336 --> 00:27:17,538
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I want to move, I think we have David.

247
00:27:18,999 --> 00:27:23,242
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to make a motion to bring this to a vote and just

248
00:27:25,828 --> 00:27:32,871
[SPEAKER_01]: see where it goes, and if not, we can debate this all night long.

249
00:27:33,191 --> 00:27:37,613
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't have these forms, and they're not created.

250
00:27:40,315 --> 00:27:41,575
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd just like to bring it to a vote.

251
00:27:41,635 --> 00:27:43,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're going to vote right now.

252
00:27:43,056 --> 00:27:47,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anybody in the public that wants to speak?

253
00:27:49,158 --> 00:27:50,179
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll ask again.

254
00:27:50,339 --> 00:27:52,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any member of the public that would like to speak?

255
00:27:56,143 --> 00:27:56,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

256
00:27:57,424 --> 00:27:57,944
[SPEAKER_02]: J.M.N.

257
00:27:57,984 --> 00:27:59,925
[SPEAKER_02]: made a comment, liquor store is a bad example.

258
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:00,726
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

259
00:28:03,108 --> 00:28:03,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

260
00:28:03,969 --> 00:28:21,963
[SPEAKER_02]: So the vote is that should we put a provision in the charter that would require the city council to create an ordinance to require elected officials, candidates for elected offices, and some city officials to file annual financial statements?

261
00:28:23,521 --> 00:28:27,824
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry, it looks like Jim wants to make a comment.

262
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:30,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think she may want to speak.

263
00:28:31,447 --> 00:28:34,569
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we will know.

264
00:28:36,871 --> 00:28:37,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you unmute now?

265
00:28:44,337 --> 00:28:45,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Gene, can you unmute yourself?

266
00:28:50,181 --> 00:28:51,422
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure why she can't.

267
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:55,750
[SPEAKER_03]: She wrote.

268
00:28:59,252 --> 00:29:00,372
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure why.

269
00:29:08,516 --> 00:29:12,277
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm clicking ask to unmute, but I can't.

270
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:12,877
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

271
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:16,299
[SPEAKER_02]: You should be able to unmute yourself.

272
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you not able to?

273
00:29:21,618 --> 00:29:23,881
[SPEAKER_12]: You have to be a co host on mute.

274
00:29:24,401 --> 00:29:26,063
[SPEAKER_02]: No, the security settings.

275
00:29:26,744 --> 00:29:28,265
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm clicking and it won't let me.

276
00:29:28,285 --> 00:29:31,169
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure.

277
00:29:31,189 --> 00:29:31,889
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

278
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:34,032
[SPEAKER_02]: I will try one more thing.

279
00:29:34,052 --> 00:29:36,434
[SPEAKER_07]: I think she had it a second ago.

280
00:29:36,455 --> 00:29:38,457
[SPEAKER_02]: I will try one more thing.

281
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you do it now?

282
00:29:47,457 --> 00:29:55,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell her to look in the left hand corner of your computer and see if the microphone has an arrow through it or a line through it and click on that.

283
00:29:56,011 --> 00:29:59,658
[SPEAKER_04]: In the bottom left underneath the screens here, jam in.

284
00:30:00,578 --> 00:30:04,160
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I guess we can't get it done.

285
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:20,627
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're able to unmute, let us know, but the comments are currently this is self-regulated, and I assume that means that the electeds are self-regulating themselves in terms of complying with the state law, the conflict of interest law.

286
00:30:22,108 --> 00:30:22,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

287
00:30:23,008 --> 00:30:23,949
[SPEAKER_12]: Paula, it's raising her hand.

288
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:43,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so, so currently every elected official, you know, has to do the ethics and you have to go, you have to sit through the ethics training, you have to do it, I think, is it every year or every other year you have to do it, and you have to sign a form at the end and whatever.

289
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:48,783
[SPEAKER_03]: So by putting something in where we're asking people to go to one

290
00:30:49,623 --> 00:30:59,405
[SPEAKER_03]: level higher, when you say a 42 page, I'm totally against that, because I definitely think that would be restrictive and obstructive and too much.

291
00:31:00,565 --> 00:31:04,246
[SPEAKER_03]: We do already have to do the campaign finance reports, which are a pain in the neck.

292
00:31:06,046 --> 00:31:12,788
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, though, I'm not totally against the idea of doing something, but I think it has to be very reasonable.

293
00:31:14,309 --> 00:31:21,675
[SPEAKER_03]: What we're trying to prevent is anybody, you know, who may not even realize that there's a conflict in some ways.

294
00:31:22,375 --> 00:31:36,607
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, the wording to send it to the city council and say develop an ordinance without, you know, that, you know, we want it to be easy enough to comply with, but at the same time,

295
00:31:39,457 --> 00:31:45,657
[SPEAKER_03]: clarify to an elected official exactly what all that conflict of interest training is about.

296
00:31:46,378 --> 00:31:49,020
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so I want to go ahead with the vote.

297
00:31:49,201 --> 00:32:02,453
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, Jean, JMN was unable to unmute, but she's making a point that this would create more transparency and that currently elected officials are in charge of, it's sort of an honor system.

298
00:32:04,054 --> 00:32:09,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and this vote is simply whether we want to put a provision in the charter.

299
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,401
[SPEAKER_02]: We will not write the ordinance.

300
00:32:13,481 --> 00:32:14,982
[SPEAKER_02]: The city council will write the ordinance.

301
00:32:15,102 --> 00:32:18,583
[SPEAKER_02]: We can direct it to a certain extent, but we can't micromanage it.

302
00:32:18,683 --> 00:32:32,989
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is to put a provision in the charter for the city council to pass an ordinance to require financial statements annually from candidates, elected officials, and some city officials.

303
00:32:33,129 --> 00:32:35,670
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you vote yes, you're in favor of that.

304
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:37,210
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Danielle.

305
00:32:38,191 --> 00:32:38,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

306
00:32:43,273 --> 00:32:43,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Maury?

307
00:32:44,194 --> 00:32:46,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

308
00:32:46,415 --> 00:32:46,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Anthony?

309
00:32:47,496 --> 00:32:47,796
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

310
00:32:49,737 --> 00:32:50,078
[SPEAKER_02]: Jean?

311
00:32:51,278 --> 00:32:51,519
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

312
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:53,320
[SPEAKER_02]: Paulette?

313
00:32:56,962 --> 00:32:57,863
[SPEAKER_02]: You're on mute, Paulette.

314
00:33:00,885 --> 00:33:01,906
[SPEAKER_02]: You say yes, okay.

315
00:33:02,786 --> 00:33:03,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Eunice?

316
00:33:04,087 --> 00:33:04,407
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

317
00:33:05,848 --> 00:33:06,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Phyllis?

318
00:33:07,626 --> 00:33:08,546
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to abstain.

319
00:33:08,866 --> 00:33:10,467
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still not certain about this.

320
00:33:11,607 --> 00:33:12,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

321
00:33:16,368 --> 00:33:16,708
[SPEAKER_02]: Ron?

322
00:33:17,988 --> 00:33:18,248
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

323
00:33:20,769 --> 00:33:21,229
[SPEAKER_02]: David?

324
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:25,610
[SPEAKER_02]: David, you're on mute.

325
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:26,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you can't unmute?

326
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:28,411
[SPEAKER_02]: You're yes?

327
00:33:28,471 --> 00:33:29,151
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm unmuted.

328
00:33:29,751 --> 00:33:30,231
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're yes?

329
00:33:30,951 --> 00:33:31,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you.

330
00:33:33,892 --> 00:33:35,332
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm the last one, right?

331
00:33:37,976 --> 00:33:47,238
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just, I'm going to vote no, because I, I just think, I think it's a lot to put into the charter, but it passes.

332
00:33:47,699 --> 00:33:51,139
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, cause we had five yes or no and one abstain.

333
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:59,582
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, the next step we are going to, we're going to have to figure out the cats and we're going to ask the call center to help us with that.

334
00:34:00,382 --> 00:34:00,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Um,

335
00:34:03,049 --> 00:34:13,539
[SPEAKER_02]: The other question that we had is whether to create an ethics commission, whether the ordinance should create an ethics commission that would implement this.

336
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Anthony Wilson, you had a comment.

337
00:34:16,903 --> 00:34:18,985
[SPEAKER_09]: It's more of a clarification on the previous vote.

338
00:34:20,306 --> 00:34:26,972
[SPEAKER_09]: Was the vote to include, I just want to try to understand, it was to include a provision, I'm assuming in the transition provisions,

339
00:34:27,734 --> 00:34:33,580
[SPEAKER_09]: that at some point in time the city council create this ordinance or is this a recommendation that'll be in the report?

340
00:34:34,721 --> 00:34:37,263
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it was just voted to put it into the charter.

341
00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:39,426
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, just make sure I understood.

342
00:34:39,486 --> 00:34:39,746
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

343
00:34:40,427 --> 00:34:42,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

344
00:34:45,952 --> 00:34:51,678
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess the details of it are gonna have to be decided.

345
00:34:55,038 --> 00:35:01,181
[SPEAKER_02]: I think maybe what we'll, we're going to have to do is have a subcommittee meeting again and then bring back specific language recommendation.

346
00:35:05,324 --> 00:35:05,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

347
00:35:08,265 --> 00:35:15,849
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that, is that, I think we already voted on this once in June and now we voted again on it now.

348
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:17,910
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to go to another subcommittee meeting.

349
00:35:18,751 --> 00:35:20,592
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is like late in the game.

350
00:35:21,127 --> 00:35:27,951
[SPEAKER_01]: to really get into developing a whole other layer in this charter.

351
00:35:28,111 --> 00:35:31,432
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is this gonna end?

352
00:35:31,833 --> 00:35:33,874
[SPEAKER_02]: The vote in June was to form the subcommittee.

353
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:41,718
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we voted it down, but then I believe then they wanted to form the subcommittee.

354
00:35:41,758 --> 00:35:44,419
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it was tied.

355
00:35:44,539 --> 00:35:49,562
[SPEAKER_01]: And since it was tied, I decided that- Tied means it doesn't pass.

356
00:35:50,365 --> 00:35:56,027
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, but I as the chair, I decided to go ahead with it because I felt like there was enough interest in it.

357
00:35:57,347 --> 00:35:59,528
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so that's what we're going to do.

358
00:35:59,568 --> 00:36:03,169
[SPEAKER_02]: The subcommittee is going to come up with some text and we'll bring it back to the committee.

359
00:36:03,289 --> 00:36:07,491
[SPEAKER_02]: It will not be a big piece of text to add to our draft charter, which we currently have.

360
00:36:08,231 --> 00:36:08,451
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

361
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:23,328
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so the next item on the agenda is, before we get into the meat of the text of the draft charter, there was a question about the Compensation Advisory Board and the Collins.

362
00:36:23,708 --> 00:36:27,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody read the draft charter and the memo from the Collins Center?

363
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:28,529
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

364
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:29,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

365
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:31,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

366
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:57,390
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we can just go ahead to a vote, which is do we, the drafted section 918, which was put in the memo, not in our draft charter, do we want to include that in our charter or do we want to, the question is, do we want to include that in our charter or do we just want to make a recommendation in the final report that the city council pass an ordinance to create a compensation advisory board?

367
00:36:58,185 --> 00:36:59,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Does everybody understand what we're voting on?

368
00:37:00,626 --> 00:37:00,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

369
00:37:01,507 --> 00:37:03,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so a yes vote.

370
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:05,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.

371
00:37:05,428 --> 00:37:09,230
[SPEAKER_12]: Did we already vote to vote on that idea of creating an advisory board?

372
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:26,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we did, but when the Collins Center put together a draft charter, they are pulling that out and making a recommendation that we consider not including it in the charter and rather recommending that the city council write an ordinance to do it.

373
00:37:27,212 --> 00:37:31,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I'm of the mind always.

374
00:37:31,593 --> 00:37:34,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, you know, and I understand.

375
00:37:34,914 --> 00:37:39,136
[SPEAKER_07]: The purpose of the charter and so forth, but I, I'm of the mind that.

376
00:37:39,616 --> 00:37:47,218
[SPEAKER_07]: When things like this that are this important come up, um, that we mandate as much as we possibly can.

377
00:37:47,238 --> 00:37:53,660
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and it simply mandates that there is a board that will, um.

378
00:37:54,944 --> 00:38:05,083
[SPEAKER_07]: Review the compensation and, you know, it's a. Citizen led board, rather than leaving it to the elected officials.

379
00:38:05,503 --> 00:38:07,247
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm of the mind that we.

380
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,962
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, we compel as much as possible.

381
00:38:12,542 --> 00:38:17,347
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to be clear, the citizen-led board can't determine salaries, they can just make recommendations.

382
00:38:17,407 --> 00:38:19,228
[SPEAKER_02]: The elected officials will make the decisions.

383
00:38:19,509 --> 00:38:27,616
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, I understand that, but I think coming from the community rather than, you know, as I keep going back to say, fox guarding the hen house.

384
00:38:28,737 --> 00:38:29,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

385
00:38:29,417 --> 00:38:32,180
[SPEAKER_07]: Take as much power away from the electeds as we can.

386
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,741
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thank you.

387
00:38:33,761 --> 00:38:33,801
[SPEAKER_07]: Ra.

388
00:38:35,402 --> 00:38:37,744
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I know you don't want to have a long discussion.

389
00:38:37,804 --> 00:38:39,345
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm voting against this.

390
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:47,330
[SPEAKER_11]: I just don't see where there's no power, there's no influence, there's no commitment.

391
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:49,632
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just a data gathering group.

392
00:38:49,672 --> 00:38:53,755
[SPEAKER_11]: And as we see, sometimes they take the data, sometimes they don't.

393
00:38:53,815 --> 00:38:57,977
[SPEAKER_11]: To me, it's just very superfluous.

394
00:38:59,158 --> 00:39:01,000
[SPEAKER_11]: This one, to me, it's a lot of work.

395
00:39:01,902 --> 00:39:05,183
[SPEAKER_11]: to have no results, no power, so I'm voting against it.

396
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:19,028
[SPEAKER_11]: This advisory board is not necessarily a value, unless the mayor wanted to convene to find out what's going on, but other than that, no power, no advisory board, that's my opinion.

397
00:39:19,829 --> 00:39:20,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you.

398
00:39:21,869 --> 00:39:28,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so should we have any members of the public that want to speak on this before we vote?

399
00:39:32,418 --> 00:39:32,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

400
00:39:33,279 --> 00:39:36,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead, Paula.

401
00:39:37,242 --> 00:39:52,574
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that one of the things is, while I favored it, is because as an elected official, it is really tough to decide that you're going to vote for an increase.

402
00:39:53,094 --> 00:39:57,398
[SPEAKER_03]: And because of that reason, the school committee stayed at the same level for

403
00:39:58,018 --> 00:40:04,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Years and years, because none of us wanted to be the one who was going to say we should get paid more.

404
00:40:05,623 --> 00:40:14,389
[SPEAKER_03]: And the discrepancy between the school committee and the city council became even higher for many, many, many years.

405
00:40:14,909 --> 00:40:18,232
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason for that is that you're so afraid when budgets are always tight,

406
00:40:19,187 --> 00:40:36,982
[SPEAKER_03]: You are definitely afraid that if you're the one who puts out, hey, the school committee really should get an increase in our stipend, I can guarantee you that everybody's going to jump on you and say, you know, you can't, we can't fund the public schools, but you want an increase.

407
00:40:37,562 --> 00:40:44,326
[SPEAKER_03]: So I like this idea because I thought it gave an outside voice of looking at it saying, hey, this is reasonable.

408
00:40:44,386 --> 00:40:44,866
[SPEAKER_03]: This isn't.

409
00:40:45,606 --> 00:40:52,690
[SPEAKER_03]: And it certainly isn't a, you know, like you said, there's no power.

410
00:40:53,030 --> 00:41:03,856
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think to have an outside community saying, hey, we've really looked at this and look at the discrepancy or we've looked at this and look, they've had they haven't had an increase in 10 years.

411
00:41:05,176 --> 00:41:06,497
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so that's why I liked it.

412
00:41:08,155 --> 00:41:08,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

413
00:41:08,895 --> 00:41:12,838
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to vote.

414
00:41:13,238 --> 00:41:16,760
[SPEAKER_02]: If you vote yes, it means you would like to include this in the charter.

415
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,742
[SPEAKER_02]: If you vote no, it means you don't want it in the charter.

416
00:41:20,422 --> 00:41:23,324
[SPEAKER_02]: And we will recommend that the city council create an ordinance.

417
00:41:23,384 --> 00:41:27,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we did discuss this in the past, and people did want to do this.

418
00:41:27,786 --> 00:41:30,228
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think the issue

419
00:41:30,979 --> 00:41:39,893
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe the Collins Center can speak to this, but the Collins Center felt that it just didn't, it's not a standard charter item and it didn't rise to the level of the charter.

420
00:41:40,013 --> 00:41:40,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that correct?

421
00:41:43,278 --> 00:41:45,241
[SPEAKER_09]: That is correct, yes.

422
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:50,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so on that, with that, let's vote, Danielle.

423
00:41:51,232 --> 00:41:56,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes means you want to put it, you want to put the requirement that this board has created in the charter.

424
00:41:56,893 --> 00:42:01,695
[SPEAKER_02]: No means we want it, but we're going to recommend that the city council pass an ordinance decree.

425
00:42:01,995 --> 00:42:04,375
[SPEAKER_11]: Milva, I saw a hand go up quickly from the public.

426
00:42:04,395 --> 00:42:05,916
[SPEAKER_11]: You may want to just ask again.

427
00:42:06,236 --> 00:42:07,096
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if it's still there.

428
00:42:07,116 --> 00:42:10,877
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's down, but you may want to ask.

429
00:42:12,098 --> 00:42:13,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody want to speak from the public?

430
00:42:17,146 --> 00:42:17,766
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see it.

431
00:42:19,567 --> 00:42:19,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

432
00:42:20,907 --> 00:42:23,108
[SPEAKER_02]: So do we understand what the yes and the no?

433
00:42:23,788 --> 00:42:24,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

434
00:42:24,228 --> 00:42:24,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Danielle?

435
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:25,509
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

436
00:42:26,709 --> 00:42:27,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

437
00:42:27,549 --> 00:42:27,969
[SPEAKER_02]: Maury?

438
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:31,791
[SPEAKER_04]: You're on mute, Maury.

439
00:42:33,991 --> 00:42:34,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Phyllis.

440
00:42:35,172 --> 00:42:35,432
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

441
00:42:36,252 --> 00:42:36,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

442
00:42:37,613 --> 00:42:37,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Anthony?

443
00:42:39,073 --> 00:42:39,293
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

444
00:42:39,953 --> 00:42:40,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Gene?

445
00:42:41,554 --> 00:42:41,814
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

446
00:42:43,955 --> 00:42:44,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Paulette?

447
00:42:44,815 --> 00:42:45,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

448
00:42:46,474 --> 00:42:46,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Unis.

449
00:42:47,354 --> 00:42:47,614
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

450
00:42:48,215 --> 00:42:48,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Phyllis.

451
00:42:49,255 --> 00:42:49,575
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

452
00:42:52,816 --> 00:42:53,216
[SPEAKER_02]: David.

453
00:42:55,897 --> 00:42:58,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

454
00:42:58,437 --> 00:43:00,878
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I missed somebody.

455
00:43:02,078 --> 00:43:02,959
[SPEAKER_11]: Ron says no.

456
00:43:03,139 --> 00:43:03,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Ron, thank you.

457
00:43:04,359 --> 00:43:05,119
[SPEAKER_02]: Ron says no.

458
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,200
[SPEAKER_02]: What does Milda say?

459
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:11,361
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to say no and we'll recommend the ordinance.

460
00:43:12,161 --> 00:43:12,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

461
00:43:12,601 --> 00:43:12,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

462
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,961
[SPEAKER_02]: That will be put into the final report.

463
00:43:18,002 --> 00:43:18,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

464
00:43:18,902 --> 00:43:19,242
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

465
00:43:19,562 --> 00:43:22,004
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're going to move on to the draft charter.

466
00:43:22,184 --> 00:43:28,647
[SPEAKER_02]: And I ask that you all read it and come with amendments.

467
00:43:29,368 --> 00:43:31,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Jean?

468
00:43:31,489 --> 00:43:38,032
[SPEAKER_08]: When we say put, since we're on the final report committee, where in the report do we want to put that?

469
00:43:38,092 --> 00:43:39,633
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that going to go in the budget?

470
00:43:39,653 --> 00:43:40,314
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

471
00:43:40,394 --> 00:43:40,654
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

472
00:43:40,714 --> 00:43:41,774
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll figure it out.

473
00:43:42,115 --> 00:43:42,915
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll figure it out.

474
00:43:42,955 --> 00:43:43,575
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

475
00:43:45,249 --> 00:43:49,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so does anybody, I have a few things, but I'll ask people first.

476
00:43:49,992 --> 00:43:54,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any amendments that you want to make in this draft charter, Paulette?

477
00:43:56,515 --> 00:44:01,338
[SPEAKER_03]: So just some of the things are things I caught.

478
00:44:02,358 --> 00:44:06,360
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, and we'll talk about it.

479
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:13,064
[SPEAKER_03]: So on page... Can we go article by article, maybe?

480
00:44:14,528 --> 00:44:15,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

481
00:44:16,271 --> 00:44:16,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

482
00:44:16,691 --> 00:44:17,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Eunice.

483
00:44:17,953 --> 00:44:18,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

484
00:44:19,255 --> 00:44:20,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do it article by article.

485
00:44:20,617 --> 00:44:21,478
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I meant to do.

486
00:44:21,558 --> 00:44:22,660
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you.

487
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Section 1-3, division of powers.

488
00:44:26,378 --> 00:44:26,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

489
00:44:27,399 --> 00:44:29,281
[SPEAKER_03]: The school committee is not mentioned at all.

490
00:44:29,921 --> 00:44:30,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

491
00:44:31,222 --> 00:44:37,347
[SPEAKER_03]: So you talk about the mayor and you talk about the city council, but our Medford system of government has three legs.

492
00:44:37,868 --> 00:44:46,075
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think it would be, we should add the Medford public school schools will be overseen by an elected school committee.

493
00:44:49,345 --> 00:44:52,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so that would be the language that would be added.

494
00:44:52,670 --> 00:45:03,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Can the call-in center weigh in on, because you didn't suggest that in the draft, so can you speak to that?

495
00:45:05,313 --> 00:45:07,634
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if anyone else on my team have any thoughts.

496
00:45:08,034 --> 00:45:10,915
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think we have any major thoughts or concerns about it.

497
00:45:11,336 --> 00:45:15,457
[SPEAKER_09]: The language there is basically the standard language across all charters, so.

498
00:45:15,737 --> 00:45:19,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, and my concern is that traditionally the school committee is left out.

499
00:45:20,139 --> 00:45:30,744
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why I raise it up and say, wait a second, we talk about the school committee in this, why isn't there any mention of it in the Division of Powers?

500
00:45:34,947 --> 00:45:37,448
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree, Paula, that was my comment there too.

501
00:45:39,409 --> 00:45:41,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

502
00:45:41,651 --> 00:45:51,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Frank or Marilyn, is there any thoughts about it or anything that there's no reason not to include it or is there a reason that it's generally not included?

503
00:45:56,098 --> 00:45:59,660
[SPEAKER_10]: My thought is that it's not generally included because

504
00:46:01,423 --> 00:46:04,966
[SPEAKER_10]: The charter relates to the government of the city overall.

505
00:46:04,986 --> 00:46:14,893
[SPEAKER_10]: And the school committee is effectively running one department, a huge department, half the city budget, but it is a department.

506
00:46:15,033 --> 00:46:17,755
[SPEAKER_10]: And a lot of what the school committee does is governed by state law.

507
00:46:19,136 --> 00:46:22,458
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's just my personal opinion.

508
00:46:22,478 --> 00:46:27,042
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're also elected members of the community also.

509
00:46:28,765 --> 00:46:40,187
[SPEAKER_10]: They are, but in some communities you elect people for planning and zoning, and those towns elect a lot of the various committees and all that, but it's basically the Board of Selectmen.

510
00:46:41,827 --> 00:46:55,050
[SPEAKER_10]: But again, just a thought, I don't see any downside necessarily to including it, but I'm just looking at it from the position of

511
00:46:56,283 --> 00:47:07,368
[SPEAKER_10]: You've got a mayor, and then you've got a legislative body, and they oversee the city itself generally, as opposed to the school committee, which has a much narrower focus.

512
00:47:09,069 --> 00:47:10,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you.

513
00:47:12,771 --> 00:47:17,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so are the raised hands about this particular issue?

514
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:19,940
[SPEAKER_02]: No, OK.

515
00:47:20,981 --> 00:47:27,263
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Paulette, can you just read the language that you want to add so I can get it down?

516
00:47:27,623 --> 00:47:32,565
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wrote, Medford's public schools will be overseen by the elected school committee.

517
00:47:35,706 --> 00:47:36,086
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

518
00:47:38,127 --> 00:47:43,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you could say, an elected school committee will oversee Medford's public schools, if you like that better.

519
00:47:44,210 --> 00:47:44,510
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

520
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:47,691
[SPEAKER_03]: An elected school committee will oversee Medford's public schools.

521
00:47:50,053 --> 00:47:52,014
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, that's fine.

522
00:47:52,174 --> 00:47:58,676
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very vague to me, but you know, because it doesn't mean anything.

523
00:47:58,716 --> 00:48:00,056
[SPEAKER_02]: You just want them to be included.

524
00:48:00,496 --> 00:48:00,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

525
00:48:00,776 --> 00:48:04,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Because later on in Article 4, we talk about the school committee.

526
00:48:04,758 --> 00:48:05,178
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

527
00:48:05,198 --> 00:48:06,418
[SPEAKER_03]: That's sort of beginning general.

528
00:48:06,458 --> 00:48:07,638
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't say anything about it.

529
00:48:07,738 --> 00:48:18,882
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's just been this tradition of even when we were meeting twice as much as the city council, the school committee was always the lesser than.

530
00:48:21,469 --> 00:48:23,370
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just think it makes sense to include it.

531
00:48:24,291 --> 00:48:24,631
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

532
00:48:25,171 --> 00:48:43,102
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's note now, the vote is to include language, to include an elected school committee will oversee Medford's public schools or similar language, because maybe the call-in center will help us tweak it a little bit, to section 1.3.

533
00:48:43,922 --> 00:48:47,264
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you vote yes, then you want to add it.

534
00:48:48,345 --> 00:48:48,805
[SPEAKER_02]: If not,

535
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:50,851
[SPEAKER_02]: If you vote no, you don't.

536
00:48:51,331 --> 00:48:51,631
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

537
00:48:52,952 --> 00:48:53,413
[SPEAKER_02]: David?

538
00:48:56,335 --> 00:48:57,316
[SPEAKER_04]: You're on mute, David.

539
00:48:57,496 --> 00:48:57,836
[SPEAKER_04]: David?

540
00:48:59,057 --> 00:48:59,497
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm not.

541
00:48:59,838 --> 00:49:00,298
[SPEAKER_00]: I vote yes.

542
00:49:00,998 --> 00:49:01,399
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

543
00:49:01,819 --> 00:49:02,179
[SPEAKER_02]: Gene?

544
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:03,861
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

545
00:49:06,222 --> 00:49:06,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Danielle?

546
00:49:07,123 --> 00:49:09,105
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I get called on to vote, I unmute.

547
00:49:09,265 --> 00:49:11,687
[SPEAKER_00]: I say yes.

548
00:49:13,388 --> 00:49:13,708
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

549
00:49:13,788 --> 00:49:14,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Danielle is yes.

550
00:49:15,570 --> 00:49:15,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Morris?

551
00:49:15,810 --> 00:49:15,890
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

552
00:49:20,781 --> 00:49:21,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Anthony.

553
00:49:24,584 --> 00:49:24,824
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

554
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:27,886
[SPEAKER_02]: Paulette.

555
00:49:28,506 --> 00:49:30,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

556
00:49:30,488 --> 00:49:30,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Eunice.

557
00:49:31,568 --> 00:49:31,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

558
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:34,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Phyllis.

559
00:49:35,050 --> 00:49:37,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

560
00:49:37,812 --> 00:49:39,413
[SPEAKER_02]: One more person, Ron.

561
00:49:40,534 --> 00:49:40,834
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

562
00:49:42,095 --> 00:49:42,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

563
00:49:44,810 --> 00:49:48,113
[SPEAKER_02]: No, just because I don't think it's necessary, but it's going to be editing.

564
00:49:48,993 --> 00:49:49,934
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's great.

565
00:49:49,994 --> 00:49:50,554
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one.

566
00:49:51,995 --> 00:49:54,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Does anybody have any other amendments for Article 1?

567
00:49:55,958 --> 00:49:56,158
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

568
00:49:57,079 --> 00:49:57,399
[SPEAKER_08]: Jean?

569
00:49:59,201 --> 00:50:00,221
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not an amendment.

570
00:50:00,341 --> 00:50:04,324
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a question for the Collins Center about multi-member bodies.

571
00:50:07,466 --> 00:50:14,888
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is just to clarify for me, because my understanding is this doesn't cover multi bodies created by statute.

572
00:50:15,348 --> 00:50:23,730
[SPEAKER_08]: But is it assumed everybody understands multi member bodies are just the ones created by city government?

573
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:25,511
[SPEAKER_08]: Does that need to be clarified?

574
00:50:25,571 --> 00:50:26,491
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess is my question.

575
00:50:32,590 --> 00:50:34,612
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to kind of call on Marilyn.

576
00:50:35,072 --> 00:50:36,533
[SPEAKER_09]: You did most of the definitions.

577
00:50:36,933 --> 00:50:38,214
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have anything to add there?

578
00:50:40,936 --> 00:50:46,220
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't remember a conversation that it didn't include all boards.

579
00:50:48,722 --> 00:50:58,890
[SPEAKER_08]: Because some of the boards are created by state statute and right, and they are included in that they are included in that definition.

580
00:51:00,312 --> 00:51:05,494
[SPEAKER_08]: but then later they're not all appointed in the same way?

581
00:51:09,436 --> 00:51:11,157
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the definition is not exclusive.

582
00:51:11,177 --> 00:51:13,778
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm reading the right one.

583
00:51:13,798 --> 00:51:19,581
[SPEAKER_09]: It just says, but not including the school, the city council school committee and advisory committees appointed by the mayor.

584
00:51:19,601 --> 00:51:25,403
[SPEAKER_09]: Because then the definition is used later on to talking about certain requirements that the multi-member boards should follow.

585
00:51:26,004 --> 00:51:28,565
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's supposed to be, I believe it's supposed to be an inclusive definition.

586
00:51:29,468 --> 00:51:30,409
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, that's fine.

587
00:51:30,769 --> 00:51:33,532
[SPEAKER_08]: But then do we exclude them later?

588
00:51:33,552 --> 00:51:40,838
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like they weren't sorry if I'm making this complicated, but I was trying to go back and talk about the city council, the school committee.

589
00:51:40,858 --> 00:51:41,859
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I'm.

590
00:51:43,542 --> 00:51:55,052
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm talking about like boards like there's a is there the I don't know a good example, but boards that are city boards created by the planning board or the.

591
00:51:55,733 --> 00:52:00,096
[SPEAKER_13]: If you have a board created by ordinance, they're included in this definition.

592
00:52:01,938 --> 00:52:04,520
[SPEAKER_08]: But if they're created by state statute.

593
00:52:06,061 --> 00:52:07,783
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're included in this definition.

594
00:52:08,716 --> 00:52:14,980
[SPEAKER_08]: That's fine, but then later we have a section about multi member boards appointments.

595
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:16,101
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to find it.

596
00:52:16,121 --> 00:52:20,324
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it's in the general provision section.

597
00:52:22,425 --> 00:52:23,466
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that under?

598
00:52:25,527 --> 00:52:27,568
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, Marilyn, do you know which section it is?

599
00:52:27,588 --> 00:52:31,631
[SPEAKER_08]: It's usually around 8586.

600
00:52:35,702 --> 00:52:38,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you thinking, Jean, about the confirmation?

601
00:52:39,443 --> 00:52:43,504
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, section 3.3, appointments by the mayor.

602
00:52:43,524 --> 00:52:43,564
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

603
00:52:47,225 --> 00:52:50,747
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I think there's another whole section about multi-member boards in Article 9.

604
00:52:51,107 --> 00:52:54,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, but your question is about the confirmation power.

605
00:52:54,888 --> 00:52:58,609
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, and it only expends

606
00:53:00,313 --> 00:53:02,295
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to please jump in.

607
00:53:02,755 --> 00:53:13,782
[SPEAKER_08]: You remember this better, but this appointment power is not covering multi-member boards that are set up by statute, because they have different provisions.

608
00:53:13,802 --> 00:53:22,348
[SPEAKER_08]: So on section 3.3, do we need to exclude those multi-member boards from that section?

609
00:53:22,368 --> 00:53:24,830
[SPEAKER_08]: I understand this is rather technical.

610
00:53:26,411 --> 00:53:29,213
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm having trouble.

611
00:53:30,552 --> 00:53:35,035
[SPEAKER_13]: What boards does the mayor not appoint by statute?

612
00:53:36,977 --> 00:53:37,537
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

613
00:53:37,557 --> 00:53:41,680
[SPEAKER_08]: That was just presented as this section.

614
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:53,909
[SPEAKER_08]: Section 3.3 would not apply to multi-member boards that are developed based on state statute was my understanding.

615
00:53:55,352 --> 00:53:56,353
[SPEAKER_08]: Is anyone else following?

616
00:53:56,373 --> 00:53:56,553
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

617
00:53:56,613 --> 00:54:05,738
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're talking about the boards where, you know, the state appoint someone to the housing, the governor appoints.

618
00:54:06,699 --> 00:54:10,621
[SPEAKER_08]: And then he gave an example, like what did you say, the planning board or the.

619
00:54:14,083 --> 00:54:16,064
[SPEAKER_09]: The Board of Appeals, something something of that nature.

620
00:54:16,084 --> 00:54:19,927
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, it's not there.

621
00:54:20,707 --> 00:54:21,568
[SPEAKER_07]: The mayor appoints.

622
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:33,226
[SPEAKER_07]: most of all of the boards, there are a few cases where I think the state appoints somebody.

623
00:54:35,267 --> 00:54:39,770
[SPEAKER_08]: Or the state statute sets up the process for how the appointments happen, I thought.

624
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:45,353
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember we had that whole time we were looking at the website, which boards fall in, which boards don't fall into this?

625
00:54:45,373 --> 00:54:46,974
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

626
00:54:47,054 --> 00:54:50,036
[SPEAKER_01]: There is one where the state appoints a member.

627
00:54:50,056 --> 00:54:52,438
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something to do with housing.

628
00:54:53,103 --> 00:54:59,406
[SPEAKER_01]: And someone is appointed by the governor's office.

629
00:54:59,526 --> 00:55:02,307
[SPEAKER_01]: I forget which one it is, but I know there is one.

630
00:55:02,327 --> 00:55:04,048
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a community development board.

631
00:55:04,088 --> 00:55:07,069
[SPEAKER_13]: It's true if you have a housing authority or a redevelopment authority.

632
00:55:07,449 --> 00:55:11,371
[SPEAKER_02]: But the charter only addresses mayoral appointments, right?

633
00:55:11,911 --> 00:55:16,032
[SPEAKER_02]: So would it cover whatever appointments are made by the mayor?

634
00:55:17,173 --> 00:55:18,313
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, that was my question.

635
00:55:18,673 --> 00:55:21,275
[SPEAKER_08]: This is just any appointments made by the mayor.

636
00:55:21,295 --> 00:55:21,335
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

637
00:55:22,875 --> 00:55:24,116
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, sorry to get confused.

638
00:55:24,136 --> 00:55:24,656
[SPEAKER_08]: That's okay.

639
00:55:24,756 --> 00:55:26,757
[SPEAKER_08]: But I did double check that we were.

640
00:55:27,337 --> 00:55:28,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, awesome.

641
00:55:29,698 --> 00:55:32,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so any other amendments to section one?

642
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:36,321
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, how about section two?

643
00:55:39,102 --> 00:55:39,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Phyllis?

644
00:55:41,363 --> 00:55:41,923
[SPEAKER_04]: You're muted.

645
00:55:42,603 --> 00:55:48,546
[SPEAKER_04]: I have in section 2.1, article two, legislative 2.1.

646
00:55:48,826 --> 00:55:51,747
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, my computer didn't paginate these for me.

647
00:55:52,675 --> 00:56:08,798
[SPEAKER_04]: But it says right above, the paragraph above section 2.2, Council President, Vice President, it says a ward councilor who removes from the ward, is that removes or relocates?

648
00:56:09,598 --> 00:56:11,259
[SPEAKER_04]: The wording there is just a little odd to me.

649
00:56:11,299 --> 00:56:13,579
[SPEAKER_04]: That might be more legal terminology to me.

650
00:56:15,799 --> 00:56:18,320
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a technical word and it means moved out of the ward.

651
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:22,844
[SPEAKER_04]: I know what it means, but I was just wondering if that was the proper word for that.

652
00:56:22,904 --> 00:56:23,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

653
00:56:25,345 --> 00:56:28,066
[SPEAKER_04]: The second question I have is in section 2.2.

654
00:56:28,826 --> 00:56:32,387
[SPEAKER_04]: It talks about vacancies.

655
00:56:33,088 --> 00:56:41,790
[SPEAKER_04]: And it talks about vacancies, and unless I've missed it, about council vice president and president, but doesn't talk about vacancies for regular council members.

656
00:56:43,371 --> 00:56:45,111
[SPEAKER_04]: And I haven't found that anywhere else.

657
00:56:50,107 --> 00:56:51,928
[SPEAKER_02]: It's section 210.

658
00:56:52,928 --> 00:56:51,928
210?

659
00:56:53,088 --> 00:57:01,250
[SPEAKER_04]: I read the whole thing, so let me skip over to 210 to see what I missed here.

660
00:57:02,190 --> 00:57:04,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, while you're doing that, Jean?

661
00:57:06,951 --> 00:57:08,051
[SPEAKER_08]: This is another question.

662
00:57:08,071 --> 00:57:12,352
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we need to define vacancy and temporary absence or is

663
00:57:14,265 --> 00:57:18,407
[SPEAKER_08]: we don't distinguish between what they are.

664
00:57:18,427 --> 00:57:18,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

665
00:57:23,089 --> 00:57:31,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Anthony or Frank or Marilyn, do charters generally define the difference between a vacancy and a temporary absence?

666
00:57:32,594 --> 00:57:33,574
[SPEAKER_13]: They do for the mayor.

667
00:57:35,275 --> 00:57:35,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

668
00:57:37,496 --> 00:57:38,996
[SPEAKER_13]: But usually not for the council.

669
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:41,598
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe we did for the mayor.

670
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:44,841
[SPEAKER_08]: We did in the mayor section, yeah.

671
00:57:45,161 --> 00:57:55,205
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so then one other question I had is we don't have any process for removing the clerk that I can tell.

672
00:57:55,385 --> 00:58:01,887
[SPEAKER_08]: So is there a process for removing the clerk and does that go in the charter?

673
00:58:01,907 --> 00:58:06,089
[SPEAKER_08]: We just say how the clerk is- We don't hire the clerk.

674
00:58:06,829 --> 00:58:07,670
[SPEAKER_08]: The city council does.

675
00:58:07,690 --> 00:58:08,590
[SPEAKER_02]: The city council does.

676
00:58:11,890 --> 00:58:15,951
[SPEAKER_08]: But we have process for removal of department heads.

677
00:58:18,091 --> 00:58:20,912
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it just assumed it's just a decision?

678
00:58:20,932 --> 00:58:24,873
[SPEAKER_08]: Because their vote, the city clerk is elected or voted in.

679
00:58:26,153 --> 00:58:26,714
[SPEAKER_08]: By the council.

680
00:58:27,114 --> 00:58:27,814
[SPEAKER_08]: By the council.

681
00:58:27,874 --> 00:58:32,855
[SPEAKER_08]: So if they wanted to remove the clerk, does that need to be defined, how that happens?

682
00:58:35,718 --> 00:58:41,481
[SPEAKER_07]: That come under like personnel or something because they can't really nearly remove him.

683
00:58:41,501 --> 00:58:43,042
[SPEAKER_07]: It would have to be for cause.

684
00:58:44,302 --> 00:58:46,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Anthony, or do you do you have any thoughts on this?

685
00:58:47,144 --> 00:58:47,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Anthony Wilson.

686
00:58:48,451 --> 00:58:52,173
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I was just going to say, um, um, Jean, you raise a valid point.

687
00:58:52,453 --> 00:59:01,178
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the assumption is, and this is a, you know, um, I don't think this provision exists about the removal of the clerk for clerks that are appointed by the council.

688
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:04,100
[SPEAKER_09]: They exist in most, they don't exist in most charters.

689
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:07,282
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, but I think the assumption is that you would remove them though.

690
00:59:07,302 --> 00:59:12,945
[SPEAKER_09]: You would remove any other department head, even though they have a different, um, even though they're appointed by the council.

691
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:21,464
[SPEAKER_08]: So in the removal of department heads, that's by the mayor in the section that we have.

692
00:59:22,405 --> 00:59:29,850
[SPEAKER_08]: So can the mayor remove a city clerk that's been elected or appointed by city council?

693
00:59:31,327 --> 00:59:32,467
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe that's the assumption.

694
00:59:32,647 --> 00:59:38,168
[SPEAKER_09]: If you wanted to add language about whether, yeah, I would say that's the assumption.

695
00:59:38,228 --> 00:59:41,189
[SPEAKER_09]: You could add language about how it would be done.

696
00:59:41,209 --> 00:59:42,869
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there'd be sort of two routes.

697
00:59:42,909 --> 00:59:53,472
[SPEAKER_09]: Either you'd say that this position is removed in the same way as department heads, which I forget the section, or you could choose some other process like a vote of the council.

698
00:59:55,272 --> 01:00:00,253
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a provision that doesn't exist in other charges that have the similar appointment authority for the clerk.

699
01:00:01,688 --> 01:00:02,029
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

700
01:00:02,810 --> 01:00:17,469
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I guess I then suggest that we add language that the clerk could be removed the same process as they are selected by city council vote.

701
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:18,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Makes sense.

702
01:00:20,038 --> 01:00:20,398
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

703
01:00:21,718 --> 01:00:29,060
[SPEAKER_08]: It seems weird to give that power to the mayor when the mayor didn't hire the clerk.

704
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:38,903
[SPEAKER_08]: But then there's no provision for, not that there's, I'm trying to address a current problem, but just we don't.

705
01:00:40,123 --> 01:00:40,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Theoretically.

706
01:00:41,563 --> 01:00:47,625
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're looking at section 27, and you want to add language?

707
01:00:49,593 --> 01:00:56,598
[SPEAKER_02]: that the clerk may be removed by a vote of the city council.

708
01:00:57,058 --> 01:00:57,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

709
01:01:01,321 --> 01:01:05,564
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I add any other city council staff?

710
01:01:06,724 --> 01:01:08,726
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, did we?

711
01:01:09,246 --> 01:01:14,950
[SPEAKER_00]: Should we add to that the same process for any city council staff under that section or?

712
01:01:15,942 --> 01:01:17,463
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember off the top of my head what we called.

713
01:01:17,623 --> 01:01:24,508
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not any other, I mean, right now all we say about staff is that city council may hire staff subject to appropriation.

714
01:01:26,769 --> 01:01:30,091
[SPEAKER_07]: So then it would make sense to have the same process for any other staff they hire.

715
01:01:30,111 --> 01:01:31,752
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.

716
01:01:33,153 --> 01:01:35,355
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say they should probably be removed.

717
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:44,222
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the thing is, we don't say how they're going to hire staff, but we don't say that they hire staff by a vote of the city council.

718
01:01:44,562 --> 01:01:44,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

719
01:01:45,262 --> 01:01:46,483
[SPEAKER_02]: We just say they so.

720
01:01:46,503 --> 01:01:51,184
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, I see I see a little bit of a difference, but I do too.

721
01:01:52,824 --> 01:01:53,404
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very fair.

722
01:01:54,184 --> 01:01:54,484
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.

723
01:01:56,845 --> 01:01:57,065
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

724
01:01:57,465 --> 01:01:57,725
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

725
01:01:58,045 --> 01:01:58,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead, Jean.

726
01:01:58,645 --> 01:02:00,386
[SPEAKER_02]: What were you going to say?

727
01:02:01,493 --> 01:02:06,055
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't know if there does become an issue, can it not be resolved?

728
01:02:06,075 --> 01:02:08,516
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we never said how this should happen.

729
01:02:08,837 --> 01:02:10,217
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?

730
01:02:10,437 --> 01:02:18,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, they're hiring the staff, so we're not saying how they... Oh, you mean the clerk?

731
01:02:19,042 --> 01:02:19,702
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the clerk.

732
01:02:20,242 --> 01:02:20,622
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

733
01:02:21,703 --> 01:02:25,605
[SPEAKER_08]: And Frank, I don't know if Frank had a comment on the city clerk piece.

734
01:02:26,888 --> 01:02:27,328
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

735
01:02:28,589 --> 01:02:36,173
[SPEAKER_10]: My thought is that generally city clerks are hired, if not by charter, by state law.

736
01:02:37,493 --> 01:02:46,498
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a function of the legislative body, which would be the city council.

737
01:02:47,799 --> 01:02:53,061
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm not sure if that statute sets forth any provision for removal.

738
01:02:53,602 --> 01:02:56,183
[SPEAKER_10]: I know a city clerk gets a term of years,

739
01:02:58,198 --> 01:03:06,487
[SPEAKER_10]: So the only thing I'd be cautious of is it may be worth looking at that statute.

740
01:03:07,028 --> 01:03:14,216
[SPEAKER_10]: It may also be worth putting in some language if you're going to include something in the charter that any removal be

741
01:03:15,499 --> 01:03:35,312
[SPEAKER_10]: uh for cause for you know for sure reasonable cause um because uh you wouldn't want somebody you wouldn't want somebody taking that position thinking they're always at the serving strictly at the will of satisfying you know six members of the city council sure okay

742
01:03:36,223 --> 01:03:48,589
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we do add that, could it be a three-quarter vote, like not just, you know, simple majority that, you know, some could just be a little unpopular and be subject to termination.

743
01:03:48,649 --> 01:03:56,632
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want to make it, you know, they have to really kind of piss off the city council to kind of lose their position.

744
01:03:56,932 --> 01:03:59,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Should we say two-thirds, because that's pretty much the standard?

745
01:04:00,734 --> 01:04:02,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you want to say three-quarters?

746
01:04:04,834 --> 01:04:06,215
[SPEAKER_01]: I think three quarters, yeah.

747
01:04:07,795 --> 01:04:13,717
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't know what the numbers, what 11, which three quarters of 11, I think it's six half dozen or another.

748
01:04:13,877 --> 01:04:16,278
[SPEAKER_11]: What is a strong majority now in the vote?

749
01:04:16,538 --> 01:04:18,039
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that two-thirds?

750
01:04:18,399 --> 01:04:18,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Two-thirds.

751
01:04:19,019 --> 01:04:21,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Two-thirds is the standard.

752
01:04:21,460 --> 01:04:26,202
[SPEAKER_11]: I would think that we should be consistent across all strong majority votes.

753
01:04:26,282 --> 01:04:26,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

754
01:04:27,645 --> 01:04:32,328
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, so on the table is ab language.

755
01:04:33,188 --> 01:04:48,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the clerk may be removed for cause by a two thirds vote of the city council and then potentially adding something about provide, you know, that, that this provision will not conflict with state law.

756
01:04:49,957 --> 01:04:50,077
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

757
01:04:51,587 --> 01:04:53,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so that's the vote.

758
01:04:53,468 --> 01:04:55,248
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to add that, yes.

759
01:04:55,709 --> 01:04:57,409
[SPEAKER_11]: Just a question, Noah.

760
01:04:57,609 --> 01:05:03,612
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't we cover the state law being the final judge of all our laws in the beginning of ours?

761
01:05:03,932 --> 01:05:04,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's true.

762
01:05:05,032 --> 01:05:06,513
[SPEAKER_11]: I was thinking that might be redundant.

763
01:05:07,753 --> 01:05:14,616
[SPEAKER_02]: You're right, but we should still look at it because if it does conflict, we might want to reconsider adding it.

764
01:05:15,825 --> 01:05:19,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so yes means yes at it.

765
01:05:19,969 --> 01:05:20,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Eunice?

766
01:05:21,129 --> 01:05:21,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

767
01:05:23,071 --> 01:05:23,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Paulette?

768
01:05:23,932 --> 01:05:24,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

769
01:05:25,533 --> 01:05:25,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Phyllis?

770
01:05:26,614 --> 01:05:28,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

771
01:05:29,076 --> 01:05:29,436
[SPEAKER_02]: Anthony?

772
01:05:30,257 --> 01:05:32,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

773
01:05:32,558 --> 01:05:32,919
[SPEAKER_02]: Gene?

774
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:33,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

775
01:05:35,841 --> 01:05:36,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Danielle?

776
01:05:37,142 --> 01:05:38,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

777
01:05:39,064 --> 01:05:39,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Ron?

778
01:05:40,305 --> 01:05:40,585
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

779
01:05:42,586 --> 01:05:42,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Maury?

780
01:05:43,467 --> 01:05:43,707
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

781
01:05:44,268 --> 01:05:44,628
[SPEAKER_02]: David?

782
01:05:46,270 --> 01:05:46,490
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

783
01:05:47,851 --> 01:05:48,171
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

784
01:05:48,351 --> 01:05:54,035
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be the lone no vote, just because it's not in any charter.

785
01:05:54,115 --> 01:05:58,717
[SPEAKER_02]: So OK, I will be added.

786
01:05:59,058 --> 01:05:59,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

787
01:05:59,698 --> 01:06:00,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other?

788
01:06:00,578 --> 01:06:00,899
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

789
01:06:01,639 --> 01:06:02,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Our hands up for section two.

790
01:06:03,583 --> 01:06:03,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

791
01:06:04,524 --> 01:06:05,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, Paulette.

792
01:06:07,086 --> 01:06:16,854
[SPEAKER_03]: So on the section 2-5, number three adds with a, has made by law, end, and it doesn't say anything else.

793
01:06:17,494 --> 01:06:19,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was mine, Paulette, too.

794
01:06:19,416 --> 01:06:22,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's a typo, and that's gonna be Dink Harrop.

795
01:06:23,339 --> 01:06:24,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

796
01:06:28,403 --> 01:06:30,504
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought in section 2-8,

797
01:06:32,918 --> 01:06:37,500
[SPEAKER_03]: Under emergency ordinances, I just need a clarification.

798
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:48,545
[SPEAKER_03]: No ordinance shall be passed finally on the date it is introduced, except in case of an emergency involving the health or safety of the people of their property, which is fine.

799
01:06:49,425 --> 01:06:52,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Or in the case of the unanimous vote of the city council.

800
01:06:53,367 --> 01:06:57,348
[SPEAKER_03]: So at the first clause, it says no ordinance shall be passed.

801
01:06:58,329 --> 01:07:00,910
[SPEAKER_03]: But if it's unanimous, it's okay, it can be passed.

802
01:07:02,686 --> 01:07:04,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that what I'm reading correctly?

803
01:07:07,470 --> 01:07:08,831
[SPEAKER_03]: So- It says.

804
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:25,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it specifically no emergency ordinance shall be passed, but if everybody votes to pass it, it's okay?

805
01:07:25,885 --> 01:07:27,126
[SPEAKER_03]: An emergency ordinance?

806
01:07:30,466 --> 01:07:35,988
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe, so the rest of that clause still applies about sort of articulating the emergency and so forth.

807
01:07:36,348 --> 01:07:43,611
[SPEAKER_09]: I think, or I know that that clause that you're referring to is to not limit the prior enumeration.

808
01:07:43,771 --> 01:07:57,476
[SPEAKER_09]: There could be ordinances, there could be emergencies not covered by the language described above that, you know, for whatever, it's basically it's a way to make sure that something that may not be

809
01:07:58,590 --> 01:08:06,152
[SPEAKER_09]: consider an emergency under the language that may be considered an emergency by the council at the time, it's still possible to pass that ordinance.

810
01:08:09,493 --> 01:08:10,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that answer your question, Paulette?

811
01:08:11,374 --> 01:08:17,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so what we're saying is, hey, you can't pass an ordinance on the first time you're introducing it.

812
01:08:17,876 --> 01:08:19,156
[SPEAKER_03]: But if everybody agrees, you can.

813
01:08:20,314 --> 01:08:26,782
[SPEAKER_11]: I just just point of information I'm trying to I hear you're saying it's true.

814
01:08:27,943 --> 01:08:30,086
[SPEAKER_11]: When an ordinance is passed.

815
01:08:34,785 --> 01:08:36,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Ron, you got muted, okay.

816
01:08:36,586 --> 01:08:46,609
[SPEAKER_11]: When it's passed 5-2 or 7-0, it goes through a process, I believe, where it has to be vetted and legal and then it hits.

817
01:08:47,249 --> 01:08:55,351
[SPEAKER_11]: I think what they're trying to say is in the event of COVID and we need to do something tomorrow, that's where the emergency is.

818
01:08:55,451 --> 01:08:58,112
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the two are separate issues.

819
01:08:58,252 --> 01:09:00,373
[SPEAKER_11]: Any ordinance has a delay period.

820
01:09:01,165 --> 01:09:02,686
[SPEAKER_07]: It has to go through three readings.

821
01:09:03,486 --> 01:09:19,875
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, either three readings or it just has to be, I don't know what the vetting is, but I think what this is saying is if everybody agrees that we need to open up a COVID center tomorrow, that will allow us to do it because- Okay, so it's absolutely if it's an emergency.

822
01:09:20,235 --> 01:09:21,476
[SPEAKER_11]: That's how I'm reading.

823
01:09:22,036 --> 01:09:25,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, if so, then it makes sense, but otherwise it's like, wait, whatever.

824
01:09:25,898 --> 01:09:27,419
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's fine, go ahead, that's fine.

825
01:09:28,259 --> 01:09:42,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, but Paulette, your question is, it says no ordinance shall be passed finally, blah, blah, blah, except in the case of an emergency or in the case of the unanimous vote of the city council.

826
01:09:42,644 --> 01:09:49,967
[SPEAKER_02]: So your question is, is the unanimous vote of the city council include ordinances that aren't emergency ordinances?

827
01:09:50,107 --> 01:09:52,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

828
01:09:53,388 --> 01:09:55,349
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, it reads yes, that it does.

829
01:09:56,138 --> 01:09:57,524
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know, maybe I'm reading it.

830
01:10:01,441 --> 01:10:09,484
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I guess I would just continue to read the rest of the section because the next sentence says no order should be considered an emergency ordinance unless you define the emergency.

831
01:10:09,704 --> 01:10:14,106
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's regardless of the clauses before it.

832
01:10:14,186 --> 01:10:19,387
[SPEAKER_09]: So even if it's passed by a unanimous vote, the council would still have to do the following things.

833
01:10:20,048 --> 01:10:24,169
[SPEAKER_09]: This section is talking specifically about emergency ordinances.

834
01:10:24,229 --> 01:10:26,750
[SPEAKER_09]: As I'm reading it, that's how I would read it.

835
01:10:27,137 --> 01:10:29,298
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was your question, Paulette, so you're good with that?

836
01:10:29,318 --> 01:10:30,618
[SPEAKER_03]: It just seems confusing to me.

837
01:10:30,638 --> 01:10:30,678
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

838
01:10:31,939 --> 01:10:34,920
[SPEAKER_03]: But if other people can figure out, that's fine.

839
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:36,081
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

840
01:10:36,661 --> 01:10:37,181
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

841
01:10:37,981 --> 01:10:38,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else?

842
01:10:38,922 --> 01:10:41,123
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not do I have it?

843
01:10:41,263 --> 01:10:42,283
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not on Article 2.

844
01:10:43,143 --> 01:10:44,064
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, Eunice.

845
01:10:45,236 --> 01:10:50,922
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, yeah, a couple here, um, in section 2, 1 regarding composition.

846
01:10:50,942 --> 01:10:53,965
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, since, uh.

847
01:10:54,966 --> 01:10:59,330
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, there was text that was deleted regarding adding of wards.

848
01:11:02,185 --> 01:11:18,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a provision somewhere in the charter or does this come under state law or something where we would need to amend the charter to increase the number of members so that we always have at least two at-large members?

849
01:11:19,879 --> 01:11:24,042
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I making sense?

850
01:11:26,144 --> 01:11:31,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Your question is if the wards increase, then will the at-large counselors decrease?

851
01:11:32,273 --> 01:11:38,557
[SPEAKER_07]: No, with the at large, we always want at least 2 at large members, correct?

852
01:11:39,558 --> 01:11:39,918
[SPEAKER_07]: So.

853
01:11:40,899 --> 01:11:45,101
[SPEAKER_07]: If if we have to increase the number of words because of the census.

854
01:11:46,142 --> 01:11:46,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Then, um.

855
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:51,402
[SPEAKER_07]: How do we go?

856
01:11:51,902 --> 01:11:54,765
[SPEAKER_07]: We're at- How do you increase the size of the council?

857
01:11:55,186 --> 01:11:55,426
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

858
01:11:55,646 --> 01:11:56,167
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

859
01:11:56,927 --> 01:12:02,994
[SPEAKER_07]: So that we always have a proper number of at-large members.

860
01:12:05,676 --> 01:12:06,898
[SPEAKER_02]: Anthony, Frank, or Marilyn?

861
01:12:07,445 --> 01:12:19,878
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so I'll start, I know Frank has some, but you, so you can't change the number of the size of the city council, except by amending the charter.

862
01:12:20,178 --> 01:12:20,679
[SPEAKER_09]: That's number one.

863
01:12:20,719 --> 01:12:26,524
[SPEAKER_09]: And then number two, with regard to the future population in Medford, which I think is where the question really

864
01:12:27,185 --> 01:12:27,685
[SPEAKER_09]: stems from.

865
01:12:29,927 --> 01:12:48,540
[SPEAKER_09]: You would not change the number of wards, you would be changing the size of the wards and the boundaries to make sure that they, and this wouldn't be, when I say you, I mean the city, a future city council, using the census information would be modifying, really it's at the precinct level, but we would be modifying the precincts so that each ward

866
01:12:49,180 --> 01:12:56,104
[SPEAKER_09]: has the same number of voters or approximately the same number of voters for your ward counselors.

867
01:12:57,364 --> 01:13:05,088
[SPEAKER_09]: So the geographic boundaries of the wards will change to reflect the numbers.

868
01:13:06,369 --> 01:13:07,189
[SPEAKER_09]: Frank, please jump in.

869
01:13:07,209 --> 01:13:11,091
[SPEAKER_09]: And if I said anything out of bounds, please correct me.

870
01:13:11,111 --> 01:13:11,852
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Anthony.

871
01:13:11,932 --> 01:13:13,893
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I think Anthony hit the nail on the head.

872
01:13:13,953 --> 01:13:16,994
[SPEAKER_10]: That's exactly what would happen is every 10 years.

873
01:13:20,577 --> 01:13:24,399
[SPEAKER_13]: And the number of people, it's the number of people, not the number of voters.

874
01:13:26,059 --> 01:13:26,519
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

875
01:13:26,619 --> 01:13:26,839
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

876
01:13:27,219 --> 01:13:29,460
[SPEAKER_13]: Precincts count people, not voters.

877
01:13:30,220 --> 01:13:30,941
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, great.

878
01:13:30,961 --> 01:13:32,661
[SPEAKER_07]: Does that answer your question, Eunice?

879
01:13:33,101 --> 01:13:33,501
[SPEAKER_07]: It does.

880
01:13:34,021 --> 01:13:41,684
[SPEAKER_07]: My next thing is in section 2.2 regarding the council president and vice president.

881
01:13:43,495 --> 01:13:48,864
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is sort of more a matter of maybe clarification and me.

882
01:13:50,126 --> 01:13:53,772
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I didn't serve on this committee, but I know we talked about it probably in full committee.

883
01:13:55,850 --> 01:14:04,013
[SPEAKER_07]: Did we somewhere along the line talk about the roles of president and vice president rotating or being shared or something somehow?

884
01:14:04,073 --> 01:14:15,597
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I know that when we did the school committee stuff, we talked about they couldn't serve for more than in that particular role for more than one consecutive term, I think.

885
01:14:16,218 --> 01:14:19,119
[SPEAKER_07]: My school committee subcommittee friends can.

886
01:14:19,939 --> 01:14:20,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that's correct.

887
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:21,440
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

888
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:23,680
[SPEAKER_07]: Did we do that for?

889
01:14:25,445 --> 01:14:30,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that part of the city council or was it just- No, that wasn't part of the city council discussion.

890
01:14:32,308 --> 01:14:33,268
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

891
01:14:33,428 --> 01:14:34,949
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it worth having any consistency?

892
01:14:35,509 --> 01:14:39,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you want to propose that we've changed the language, you can.

893
01:14:39,671 --> 01:14:40,892
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me see what we-

894
01:14:44,153 --> 01:14:45,854
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, what did we do for school committee?

895
01:14:46,034 --> 01:14:47,515
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have it right now?

896
01:14:47,575 --> 01:15:00,123
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of the areas that, um, it says nobody can, um, uh, serve in the position for more than one year, but we need to add the word consecutive, which I was going to do when we get to section four.

897
01:15:01,104 --> 01:15:04,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I, I don't necessarily think they have to be the same.

898
01:15:04,466 --> 01:15:13,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, we certainly have had history where the city council president, I don't know, has remained the same.

899
01:15:14,173 --> 01:15:15,354
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of taken root.

900
01:15:18,276 --> 01:15:20,917
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to find it.

901
01:15:21,558 --> 01:15:23,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Which, the school committee piece?

902
01:15:23,439 --> 01:15:23,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

903
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:26,741
[SPEAKER_03]: The school committee piece is in section four.

904
01:15:26,821 --> 01:15:38,869
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on page 13, which... It also, the school committee also has an extra role besides, it has vice president and secretary, I believe.

905
01:15:39,750 --> 01:15:41,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

906
01:15:43,742 --> 01:15:58,246
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, you know, I think that the roles are different to me, but if you want to make it, if you want to make it, if you want to propose an amendment that we change that language in city, in the city council.

907
01:15:58,266 --> 01:15:58,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

908
01:15:58,886 --> 01:15:59,866
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just trying to find.

909
01:16:00,786 --> 01:16:02,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

910
01:16:03,647 --> 01:16:07,968
[SPEAKER_02]: While you look for that, is anybody else have a chance to have anything for article two?

911
01:16:11,427 --> 01:16:12,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I have one.

912
01:16:13,808 --> 01:16:38,974
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to on Article Section 2.1 in Article 2, under eligibility, because we're requiring a residency requirement for ward school counselors, I would like to add a ward candidate for city council shall at the time of election be a Medford voter and shall have resided in the ward for which they're seeking office for one year prior to inauguration.

913
01:16:41,265 --> 01:16:41,785
[SPEAKER_02]: I said that.

914
01:16:42,746 --> 01:16:43,106
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

915
01:16:43,867 --> 01:16:44,227
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

916
01:16:44,548 --> 01:16:45,829
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's vote on that.

917
01:16:50,672 --> 01:16:51,013
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

918
01:16:52,674 --> 01:16:55,776
[SPEAKER_11]: You just repeat that again.

919
01:16:55,796 --> 01:16:55,836
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

920
01:16:55,856 --> 01:16:55,896
[SPEAKER_11]: So.

921
01:16:58,490 --> 01:17:02,633
[SPEAKER_02]: I add the language to section to one eligibility for City Council.

922
01:17:03,073 --> 01:17:12,339
[SPEAKER_02]: A ward candidate for City Council shall at the time of election be a method voter and shall have resided in the ward for which they're seeking office for one year prior to inauguration.

923
01:17:13,239 --> 01:17:14,340
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would be an addition.

924
01:17:15,641 --> 01:17:17,782
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, okay, David.

925
01:17:17,802 --> 01:17:22,465
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not.

926
01:17:23,065 --> 01:17:23,266
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

927
01:17:23,446 --> 01:17:23,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

928
01:17:24,887 --> 01:17:25,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Maury.

929
01:17:29,735 --> 01:17:31,536
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, he might be away, I'll get back to him.

930
01:17:31,596 --> 01:17:31,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Gene?

931
01:17:34,557 --> 01:17:34,717
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

932
01:17:34,957 --> 01:17:36,558
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I'm sorry, I didn't know I was on mute.

933
01:17:36,598 --> 01:17:37,078
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay.

934
01:17:37,358 --> 01:17:38,259
[SPEAKER_02]: You're yes, Maury?

935
01:17:38,539 --> 01:17:38,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

936
01:17:39,919 --> 01:17:40,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Danielle?

937
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:44,401
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

938
01:17:44,441 --> 01:17:47,422
[SPEAKER_11]: Braun?

939
01:17:48,023 --> 01:17:51,124
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

940
01:17:51,204 --> 01:17:51,584
[SPEAKER_02]: Phyllis?

941
01:17:54,565 --> 01:17:54,926
[SPEAKER_00]: You're muted.

942
01:17:54,946 --> 01:17:58,267
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just really scared that folks are going to move to Medford to run for city council.

943
01:17:59,079 --> 01:18:01,941
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I'm muted, but I'm thinking, can you get back to me in a second?

944
01:18:02,402 --> 01:18:02,722
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

945
01:18:03,142 --> 01:18:03,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Paulette?

946
01:18:03,983 --> 01:18:04,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

947
01:18:06,825 --> 01:18:07,185
[SPEAKER_02]: Anthony?

948
01:18:08,106 --> 01:18:08,346
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

949
01:18:11,328 --> 01:18:11,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Eunice?

950
01:18:12,289 --> 01:18:12,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

951
01:18:13,590 --> 01:18:14,591
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

952
01:18:15,191 --> 01:18:15,952
[SPEAKER_02]: And Phyllis?

953
01:18:16,052 --> 01:18:18,734
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I don't know why you'd go away from buying now that you've done it.

954
01:18:19,234 --> 01:18:21,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, but whoever's talking, it's really.

955
01:18:21,256 --> 01:18:23,197
[SPEAKER_02]: I think David, he's muted now.

956
01:18:24,098 --> 01:18:24,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Phyllis?

957
01:18:25,859 --> 01:18:26,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

958
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:26,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

959
01:18:26,860 --> 01:18:26,980
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

960
01:18:28,453 --> 01:18:29,214
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm yes.

961
01:18:29,574 --> 01:18:30,895
[SPEAKER_02]: So we will add that language.

962
01:18:31,355 --> 01:18:32,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, great.

963
01:18:33,657 --> 01:18:36,739
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything, Eunice, did you find what you wanted to propose?

964
01:18:36,759 --> 01:18:38,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I did.

965
01:18:39,361 --> 01:18:39,921
[SPEAKER_07]: The way it's.

966
01:18:41,738 --> 01:18:46,884
[SPEAKER_07]: In a school committee, and I'm just going to read this and we can talk about it for a minute.

967
01:18:47,705 --> 01:18:54,854
[SPEAKER_07]: The mayor shall service the chair of the school committee immediately prior to the 1st, regular meeting, or as soon as practical after the school committee members.

968
01:18:56,135 --> 01:18:59,619
[SPEAKER_07]: They shall choose from amongst their membership, a vice chair and a secretary.

969
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:11,987
[SPEAKER_07]: Who will each serve for one year, the position should rotate among members with no member serving more than one year in the role for which they have been elected for by the committee.

970
01:19:13,788 --> 01:19:24,434
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would be proposing something similar for the president and vice president duties.

971
01:19:25,255 --> 01:19:25,495
[SPEAKER_07]: So.

972
01:19:27,897 --> 01:19:42,106
[SPEAKER_07]: The city council shall choose from among their members, and I'm sure that a lot of this is already there, a president and a vice president who will serve for one year.

973
01:19:42,126 --> 01:19:48,931
[SPEAKER_07]: The position shall rotate amongst members with no member serving more than one year.

974
01:19:48,951 --> 01:19:51,993
[SPEAKER_07]: Paulette, were we going to add consecutively?

975
01:19:52,013 --> 01:19:54,275
[SPEAKER_03]: For one consecutive year.

976
01:19:55,193 --> 01:19:57,834
[SPEAKER_03]: is the way it should be, one consecutive year.

977
01:19:58,974 --> 01:20:01,694
[SPEAKER_07]: For which they have been selected for by the committee.

978
01:20:02,375 --> 01:20:02,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

979
01:20:03,475 --> 01:20:11,136
[SPEAKER_03]: So Paulette can serve as the vice chair in year two, she can't, but she could go be the secretary.

980
01:20:11,517 --> 01:20:12,937
[SPEAKER_03]: In year three, she could again.

981
01:20:13,277 --> 01:20:22,479
[SPEAKER_03]: It just ensures that you're not giving one person over and over again

982
01:20:23,317 --> 01:20:29,581
[SPEAKER_03]: the same power, but you're in fact giving other people the opportunity to have those positions.

983
01:20:29,941 --> 01:20:32,883
[SPEAKER_03]: At the same time, you're not saying they can never do it more than once.

984
01:20:32,923 --> 01:20:35,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, they certainly can.

985
01:20:36,165 --> 01:20:37,966
[SPEAKER_03]: It just can't be consecutive years.

986
01:20:40,067 --> 01:20:40,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

987
01:20:41,388 --> 01:20:42,428
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's on the table.

988
01:20:43,429 --> 01:20:44,730
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that per term?

989
01:20:45,450 --> 01:20:51,774
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just say, after two years, there's a new election, the whole process starts again?

990
01:20:52,551 --> 01:20:52,771
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

991
01:20:53,952 --> 01:20:54,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Per year.

992
01:20:55,252 --> 01:20:55,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

993
01:20:56,392 --> 01:21:01,334
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that it's much better to do it for every year.

994
01:21:02,094 --> 01:21:07,976
[SPEAKER_03]: You're giving other people the opportunity to take that leadership role or to do the other roles.

995
01:21:08,917 --> 01:21:13,618
[SPEAKER_03]: For instance, on the school committee, the secretary, not everybody wants to be the secretary for two years.

996
01:21:14,679 --> 01:21:17,379
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people don't like it.

997
01:21:17,479 --> 01:21:21,541
[SPEAKER_03]: By giving it once, you're allowing other people to try it.

998
01:21:23,145 --> 01:21:27,308
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I understand that, but after, the term is two years, right?

999
01:21:27,328 --> 01:21:37,996
[SPEAKER_01]: So someone serves for one year, they skip the next year, new election, they're reelected to the school committee, can they be the chair again?

1000
01:21:38,496 --> 01:21:41,478
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, it's just not two consecutive years.

1001
01:21:42,179 --> 01:21:44,921
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, that's all I wanted to know, thank you.

1002
01:21:45,423 --> 01:21:47,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, are we ready to vote on this for the city council?

1003
01:21:48,644 --> 01:21:54,486
[SPEAKER_11]: Just my comment is I don't want to confuse the school committee issue with the city council issue.

1004
01:21:54,726 --> 01:21:55,606
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we're mixing them up.

1005
01:21:55,686 --> 01:21:59,607
[SPEAKER_11]: I totally agree with Paulette's opinion on the school committee.

1006
01:22:00,228 --> 01:22:07,850
[SPEAKER_11]: To call these two equal groups is just not right because there's a chairperson always in place in the school committee.

1007
01:22:08,470 --> 01:22:10,331
[SPEAKER_11]: The mayor is always the chairperson.

1008
01:22:11,622 --> 01:22:20,949
[SPEAKER_11]: I just don't think we should be looking at jumbling, and seven people elected by the people should be able to pick who their people are.

1009
01:22:21,049 --> 01:22:29,595
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm having a problem with calling city council and school committee same structures, because they're not, because the mayor is always the chairperson.

1010
01:22:30,056 --> 01:22:31,497
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good point, Ron.

1011
01:22:31,857 --> 01:22:32,357
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it is.

1012
01:22:32,377 --> 01:22:33,458
[SPEAKER_07]: I hadn't thought of that.

1013
01:22:33,478 --> 01:22:35,920
[SPEAKER_07]: So at least there's some consistency there.

1014
01:22:37,682 --> 01:22:39,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and I actually agree with Ron.

1015
01:22:40,444 --> 01:22:48,471
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel, because there's also even outlined in the charter certain powers of the president of the city council, I just think it is a different role.

1016
01:22:48,991 --> 01:23:05,304
[SPEAKER_02]: But we will vote on adding language to the section 2-2 that the city council president and vice president will serve for one year and be rotating positions.

1017
01:23:06,035 --> 01:23:08,457
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be more elegant than that, but that's the gist of it.

1018
01:23:09,618 --> 01:23:09,898
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1019
01:23:09,998 --> 01:23:10,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Eunice.

1020
01:23:11,179 --> 01:23:11,399
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1021
01:23:12,740 --> 01:23:13,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Paulette.

1022
01:23:13,681 --> 01:23:13,881
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1023
01:23:16,503 --> 01:23:17,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Anthony Andrea.

1024
01:23:18,384 --> 01:23:18,604
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1025
01:23:20,145 --> 01:23:20,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Phyllis.

1026
01:23:21,206 --> 01:23:21,406
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1027
01:23:22,747 --> 01:23:23,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Ron.

1028
01:23:24,208 --> 01:23:24,409
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1029
01:23:25,549 --> 01:23:25,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Danielle.

1030
01:23:27,791 --> 01:23:28,011
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1031
01:23:30,073 --> 01:23:30,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Gene.

1032
01:23:31,074 --> 01:23:31,274
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1033
01:23:34,336 --> 01:23:34,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Maury.

1034
01:23:35,477 --> 01:23:35,597
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1035
01:23:37,495 --> 01:23:41,776
[SPEAKER_02]: David, no, and I'm also not.

1036
01:23:42,157 --> 01:23:42,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1037
01:23:42,737 --> 01:23:43,957
[SPEAKER_02]: So we won't make that change.

1038
01:23:44,337 --> 01:23:44,557
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1039
01:23:44,877 --> 01:23:47,158
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have just one last real quick thing.

1040
01:23:47,178 --> 01:24:01,803
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, in section two 10 in the filling of vacancies, um, it, I don't believe it says, um, in, uh,

1041
01:24:04,353 --> 01:24:08,447
[SPEAKER_07]: Does the ward seat have to be filled by a resident of the ward was my question.

1042
01:24:10,012 --> 01:24:11,633
[SPEAKER_07]: and I don't think it said that.

1043
01:24:12,453 --> 01:24:13,814
[SPEAKER_02]: You mean the vacancy?

1044
01:24:14,174 --> 01:24:14,394
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1045
01:24:14,814 --> 01:24:17,095
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the original seat does.

1046
01:24:18,116 --> 01:24:21,297
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

1047
01:24:21,777 --> 01:24:32,922
[SPEAKER_07]: If there's a vacancy, if Joe steps down for some reason, then whoever fills the seat, does that person have to also be a member of that ward?

1048
01:24:32,962 --> 01:24:35,143
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think that it specifies that in here.

1049
01:24:35,163 --> 01:24:36,163
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it does.

1050
01:24:36,243 --> 01:24:37,284
[SPEAKER_12]: It says descending order.

1051
01:24:38,372 --> 01:24:42,873
[SPEAKER_12]: of votes received by the candidate of the office of the ward counselor in the ward in which the vacancy occurs.

1052
01:24:44,914 --> 01:24:53,016
[SPEAKER_08]: Know what that means?

1053
01:24:53,056 --> 01:24:56,357
[SPEAKER_08]: When they ran, they were in the ward because they qualified.

1054
01:24:57,737 --> 01:24:58,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1055
01:24:58,077 --> 01:25:06,039
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're talking about in the case of the city council needing to fill the vacancy, meaning that none of the people that ran are eligible to serve.

1056
01:25:06,059 --> 01:25:06,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

1057
01:25:09,265 --> 01:25:16,049
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see that it does specify that, but it is a temporary appointment.

1058
01:25:20,211 --> 01:25:32,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but I mean, it could be temporary for a month or 15 months.

1059
01:25:32,157 --> 01:25:33,818
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to add that to section?

1060
01:25:35,329 --> 01:25:40,154
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's section 10 under C. Yeah.

1061
01:25:40,174 --> 01:25:56,848
[SPEAKER_07]: Vacancy shall occur in the office of counselor at large or in that of ward counselor and there's no available candidate to fill the vacancy in the manner provided in subsection A or B. The remaining members of the city council shall elect a person to fill the vacancy.

1062
01:26:00,027 --> 01:26:09,731
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you just want to add language that any person appointed to fill a ward counselor's vacancy of a ward counselor must reside in the ward.

1063
01:26:10,291 --> 01:26:10,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1064
01:26:12,772 --> 01:26:20,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Collin Center, does that make sense or is there any reason not to do that that we're not aware of?

1065
01:26:20,856 --> 01:26:27,138
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't see any issues with that language as proposed.

1066
01:26:27,158 --> 01:26:28,579
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if my colleagues have any other thoughts.

1067
01:26:31,992 --> 01:26:32,973
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have an issue with it.

1068
01:26:33,673 --> 01:26:35,394
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1069
01:26:35,614 --> 01:26:52,644
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to just say, if in the event that something like that happens, with the requirement that they live in the ward for a year before, you don't want someone just moving to a ward to be able to take a seat.

1070
01:26:53,865 --> 01:26:54,525
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know what I mean?

1071
01:26:54,545 --> 01:26:57,907
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't.

1072
01:26:57,967 --> 01:26:59,228
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, could you say that again?

1073
01:27:00,041 --> 01:27:07,044
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's a vacancy in Ward 3 for whatever reason, the city council is looking for someone, right?

1074
01:27:08,584 --> 01:27:13,166
[SPEAKER_01]: Did someone move to Ward 3 so they can get that seat?

1075
01:27:13,186 --> 01:27:16,107
[SPEAKER_12]: It takes a little while to move.

1076
01:27:16,207 --> 01:27:17,908
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

1077
01:27:18,428 --> 01:27:21,489
[SPEAKER_12]: It also says that they have to be eligible and willing.

1078
01:27:21,589 --> 01:27:24,490
[SPEAKER_12]: And would they have to live in the ward to be eligible?

1079
01:27:24,510 --> 01:27:26,351
[SPEAKER_12]: Is it redundant to add that language?

1080
01:27:26,491 --> 01:27:27,792
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good question.

1081
01:27:27,812 --> 01:27:28,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

1082
01:27:32,523 --> 01:27:37,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Eligible and willing is under B. That's for the people who ran, I think.

1083
01:27:39,028 --> 01:27:45,373
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about adding it under C. This is only for when the city council has to appoint someone.

1084
01:27:46,013 --> 01:28:06,406
[SPEAKER_02]: So the amendment on the table is that we add language to section 210C that any vacancy that has to be filled by an appointment of the city council, any vacancy in a ward counselor that has to be filled by an appointment of the city council must be a person who resides in that ward.

1085
01:28:08,087 --> 01:28:08,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1086
01:28:08,387 --> 01:28:08,708
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1087
01:28:08,848 --> 01:28:10,028
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a question.

1088
01:28:10,869 --> 01:28:11,249
[SPEAKER_02]: Phyllis.

1089
01:28:12,570 --> 01:28:15,512
[SPEAKER_04]: What do we do if there's no one in that ward that wants to take that?

1090
01:28:17,341 --> 01:28:18,242
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good question.

1091
01:28:19,583 --> 01:28:20,863
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to be honest with you.

1092
01:28:22,665 --> 01:28:36,032
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't going to jump in on this, but that's the reason I wrote it the way I wrote it, was under the assumption that it would likely be politically expedient for a council to sue somebody from the ward.

1093
01:28:36,232 --> 01:28:39,074
[SPEAKER_00]: It would probably not be popular for them to do otherwise.

1094
01:28:39,815 --> 01:28:45,678
[SPEAKER_00]: I assumed that they would, but I wanted to give them the flexibility if they can't find somebody to appoint

1095
01:28:46,445 --> 01:28:50,888
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there has to be a final fall through so that somebody fills the seat.

1096
01:28:51,649 --> 01:28:55,551
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of doubted we would ever get to that final fall through anyway.

1097
01:28:55,671 --> 01:28:56,452
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I wrote that.

1098
01:28:57,112 --> 01:28:58,093
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense to me.

1099
01:28:58,153 --> 01:29:01,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for clarifying that.

1100
01:29:02,436 --> 01:29:11,022
[SPEAKER_04]: I just think that we could say if at all possible, but I think if we don't have anyone to appoint or anyone who wants it, I think putting that in that they have to be from the ward.

1101
01:29:11,742 --> 01:29:12,343
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we fill that?

1102
01:29:13,349 --> 01:29:18,072
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, okay, so stay vacant until the next election.

1103
01:29:18,872 --> 01:29:22,294
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because we have 11 talking, you're gonna have a council of 11.

1104
01:29:23,215 --> 01:29:27,197
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, if you're down a member, it's not, you know, the end of the world.

1105
01:29:29,979 --> 01:29:31,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, okay.

1106
01:29:32,473 --> 01:29:33,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Maury, did you have a comment about this?

1107
01:29:34,315 --> 01:29:49,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I was going to say, why wouldn't we put a clause in that, you know, we call for a special election in that ward and the kind of an interim vacancy that someone is removed or moves out or resigns or whatever, that

1108
01:29:49,980 --> 01:29:58,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Within 90 days, you have just for that ward an election for that ward to replace that seat.

1109
01:29:58,303 --> 01:30:04,444
[SPEAKER_06]: If no one comes forward, then it's appointed by the council.

1110
01:30:04,705 --> 01:30:11,347
[SPEAKER_11]: Point of information, if we get to the point there's no candidates, anybody who wanted to be a candidate would get the job.

1111
01:30:12,047 --> 01:30:15,568
[SPEAKER_11]: So a vote would be not necessary.

1112
01:30:16,741 --> 01:30:19,242
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't have candidates who wouldn't have.

1113
01:30:19,482 --> 01:30:23,423
[SPEAKER_06]: A vote would have candidates from that council would tell you if there was somebody there or not.

1114
01:30:23,723 --> 01:30:25,103
[SPEAKER_06]: Then if you didn't have.

1115
01:30:25,363 --> 01:30:26,503
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1116
01:30:26,723 --> 01:30:33,085
[SPEAKER_02]: So can I just, Maury, I think what Maury is saying is we should say that there's a special election if there's a vacancy.

1117
01:30:33,145 --> 01:30:34,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what you're saying?

1118
01:30:34,065 --> 01:30:34,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

1119
01:30:35,405 --> 01:30:46,008
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to first vote on the language that Eunice proposed about saying that we add language to section 210C that the appointed person reside in the ward.

1120
01:30:47,169 --> 01:30:49,251
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll get to the special election.

1121
01:30:49,591 --> 01:30:50,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so sound good.

1122
01:30:52,073 --> 01:30:54,095
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, connected more Melvin.

1123
01:30:54,135 --> 01:30:54,696
[SPEAKER_08]: It's hard to vote.

1124
01:30:54,736 --> 01:30:55,476
[SPEAKER_02]: I know they are.

1125
01:30:55,496 --> 01:30:56,397
[SPEAKER_02]: I know they are.

1126
01:30:56,517 --> 01:30:57,098
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um,

1127
01:30:58,583 --> 01:30:58,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1128
01:30:59,363 --> 01:31:01,905
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the special election would be a whole addition.

1129
01:31:01,985 --> 01:31:02,945
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have anything.

1130
01:31:03,025 --> 01:31:06,467
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't say that there's going to be special elections for city council right now.

1131
01:31:06,567 --> 01:31:06,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1132
01:31:07,648 --> 01:31:10,289
[SPEAKER_02]: So we would be changing quite a bit.

1133
01:31:10,929 --> 01:31:26,717
[SPEAKER_02]: But we'd still have section B, right, where the next vote getter would- So what the proposal, I think, would be is to get rid of C entirely and not have the city council appoint in the case where one of the people who ran can't take the seat.

1134
01:31:27,939 --> 01:31:35,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so is that, and maybe the Collins Center has some thoughts about special elections for vacant city council seats.

1135
01:31:37,424 --> 01:31:53,633
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, just very briefly, if the committee goes forward with the special election route, I think one of the reasons, or one of the reasons communities don't sort of do special, or not that they don't do special elections, but that they make provisions for filling vacancies without using them is,

1136
01:31:54,233 --> 01:32:20,772
[SPEAKER_09]: they're expensive and taxing of the community's resources, we'd recommend that if you go the route of a special election, that you make sure that you add some time, that you have the fallbacks that you have currently in your charter language, and that the special election happen at a certain time, a certain distance away from the next regular election, so that you don't have a special election bumping up against

1137
01:32:21,472 --> 01:32:23,815
[SPEAKER_09]: your next regular election having them merge into one.

1138
01:32:23,875 --> 01:32:36,831
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you go that route, we sort of recommend around six, if the vacancy happens prior to six to eight months, I mean you can decide the time, but we usually recommend around six to eight months before the next regular election that you'll do the special election and then

1139
01:32:37,987 --> 01:32:48,137
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, whatever method you choose, I mean, if you kept the existing language, that language would then be used in the remaining six to eight month time period.

1140
01:32:48,157 --> 01:32:54,564
[SPEAKER_09]: So there are a few more steps that we'd recommend to sort of cover the operational impact of a special election.

1141
01:32:54,584 --> 01:32:57,347
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just wanted to add that to the discussion.

1142
01:32:58,500 --> 01:33:14,160
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so I think from what I understood what you just said that we do still have to vote on the language about because there could be a situation where there would be an appointment, even if we decided on a special election, because the special election would only happen during a particular timeframe.

1143
01:33:15,264 --> 01:33:18,186
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean, we would recommend that you put a time permit in for it.

1144
01:33:18,206 --> 01:33:19,386
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't have to, but we recommend it.

1145
01:33:19,446 --> 01:33:20,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, right.

1146
01:33:20,127 --> 01:33:20,867
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it makes sense.

1147
01:33:21,227 --> 01:33:22,008
[SPEAKER_02]: We did for mayor.

1148
01:33:22,808 --> 01:33:32,014
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's vote first on the language about the appointed person residing in the ward, and then we'll look at whether we want to add special election, okay?

1149
01:33:33,214 --> 01:33:44,161
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so section 210C, add language that award vacancy appointed by the city council, the person must reside in the ward.

1150
01:33:44,978 --> 01:33:46,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Eunice?

1151
01:33:47,139 --> 01:33:47,419
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1152
01:33:48,859 --> 01:33:50,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Anthony Andrea?

1153
01:33:50,940 --> 01:33:51,140
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

1154
01:33:52,300 --> 01:33:52,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Paulette?

1155
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:53,580
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1156
01:33:54,860 --> 01:33:55,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Phyllis?

1157
01:33:55,961 --> 01:33:56,201
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1158
01:33:57,181 --> 01:33:57,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Danielle?

1159
01:33:58,421 --> 01:33:58,641
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1160
01:34:00,102 --> 01:34:00,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Jean?

1161
01:34:01,222 --> 01:34:01,502
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1162
01:34:03,403 --> 01:34:03,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Ron?

1163
01:34:04,823 --> 01:34:05,103
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1164
01:34:06,723 --> 01:34:07,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Lori?

1165
01:34:08,424 --> 01:34:08,664
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1166
01:34:10,504 --> 01:34:11,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, David?

1167
01:34:13,465 --> 01:34:13,525
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

1168
01:34:14,652 --> 01:34:18,154
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to vote no for the reasons that Daveed outlined.

1169
01:34:18,454 --> 01:34:20,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so we're not adding that.

1170
01:34:20,835 --> 01:34:27,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, in terms of the special election, we would have to come up with the language for it.

1171
01:34:27,678 --> 01:34:30,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Eunice, did you want to make the comment?

1172
01:34:30,119 --> 01:34:31,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Is your hand up for... Oh, no, sorry.

1173
01:34:34,296 --> 01:34:42,983
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have language for under the mayor section, but let's just vote on whether we want to add a special election into this.

1174
01:34:43,023 --> 01:34:47,607
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if the vote is no, then we don't have to worry about figuring out timelines.

1175
01:34:48,428 --> 01:34:59,297
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll vote on, do we want to fill vacancies in the city council if there's nobody from the election who can take the seat?

1176
01:35:00,406 --> 01:35:06,411
[SPEAKER_02]: do we want to put a provision in the charter for a special election for city council?

1177
01:35:06,431 --> 01:35:11,955
[SPEAKER_11]: Just for clarification, are we saying that or are we saying if the city council cannot find a candidate?

1178
01:35:12,456 --> 01:35:13,997
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't think so.

1179
01:35:14,017 --> 01:35:16,899
[SPEAKER_11]: We're eliminating the city council choosing it.

1180
01:35:16,980 --> 01:35:24,926
[SPEAKER_02]: We're eliminating the city council potentially leaving that in depending on what timeline we would decide for the special election.

1181
01:35:24,946 --> 01:35:25,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that make sense?

1182
01:35:26,712 --> 01:35:45,927
[SPEAKER_06]: shouldn't we focus on instead of calling it for city council like that the ward representative or the ward all the person for well it could be for a specific ward it could be for an at-large seat though too but an at-large seat would be the whole city right okay

1183
01:35:46,417 --> 01:35:50,239
[SPEAKER_02]: So are you suggesting that only award counselor get replaced with a special election?

1184
01:35:50,660 --> 01:35:52,421
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought that's what we're focusing on.

1185
01:35:52,461 --> 01:35:55,903
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's what we were talking about in the last vote.

1186
01:35:56,343 --> 01:35:58,084
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you mean only award counselor?

1187
01:35:58,624 --> 01:36:01,146
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm open to either or.

1188
01:36:02,047 --> 01:36:02,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Or both.

1189
01:36:03,227 --> 01:36:03,547
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

1190
01:36:04,668 --> 01:36:05,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Phyllis.

1191
01:36:06,529 --> 01:36:10,712
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm a little confused, which is general state.

1192
01:36:11,692 --> 01:36:13,033
[SPEAKER_04]: So the suit is vacant.

1193
01:36:13,433 --> 01:36:14,754
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't find anyone to fill it.

1194
01:36:16,367 --> 01:36:19,209
[SPEAKER_04]: we either have a special election or the seat goes unfilled.

1195
01:36:21,131 --> 01:36:23,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, the seat is vacant.

1196
01:36:23,933 --> 01:36:27,096
[SPEAKER_02]: The person who got the next highest votes takes it down the line.

1197
01:36:27,116 --> 01:36:32,080
[SPEAKER_02]: If that fails, the city council appoints.

1198
01:36:32,580 --> 01:36:40,207
[SPEAKER_02]: The proposal on the table is that if that fails, if nobody who ran can take the seat, we have a special election.

1199
01:36:41,207 --> 01:36:49,049
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we don't have a special election, that seat remains vacant until the next general, I'm saying general election, the next planned election.

1200
01:36:49,690 --> 01:36:54,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, right now there's no special election written in, and right now the city council makes the appointment.

1201
01:36:55,431 --> 01:37:00,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, but my final question is- But you're saying if there's a special election and nobody runs, then what do we do?

1202
01:37:01,353 --> 01:37:02,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that what you're saying?

1203
01:37:02,413 --> 01:37:07,195
[SPEAKER_04]: There's that, but if the seat isn't filled,

1204
01:37:08,064 --> 01:37:16,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we wait, can, is the other option is that we're going to wait until the next planned election for that seat to be filled?

1205
01:37:17,893 --> 01:37:24,560
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be decided in, if we decide on a special election, we would then decide what timelines we would put in.

1206
01:37:24,720 --> 01:37:33,048
[SPEAKER_02]: So we would say in the charter, if it's X number of days or months before a regular city election, then we don't have a special.

1207
01:37:34,371 --> 01:37:38,713
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess my concern is that, you know, how many times could this possibly happen, too, you know?

1208
01:37:39,393 --> 01:37:40,934
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot of thinking about that.

1209
01:37:41,034 --> 01:37:41,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you.

1210
01:37:42,015 --> 01:37:42,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no.

1211
01:37:43,055 --> 01:37:45,636
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said, Phyllis brings up a good point.

1212
01:37:45,676 --> 01:37:58,322
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, maybe that if there's no one looking from that ward to be an alderman at large, then the seat remains vacant until the next election.

1213
01:37:59,892 --> 01:38:05,355
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I would agree with that because, I mean, there's no point in trying to pigeonhole somebody that doesn't really want it.

1214
01:38:05,375 --> 01:38:13,240
[SPEAKER_06]: I really wouldn't want a city councilor from, let's say, Ward 1 appointing someone for Ward 1 for Ward 5.

1215
01:38:13,300 --> 01:38:14,161
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I'm saying?

1216
01:38:15,561 --> 01:38:17,923
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not representing the people in that ward properly.

1217
01:38:18,523 --> 01:38:26,448
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, if no one has a desire to care about their individual ward, leave the seat vacant.

1218
01:38:28,223 --> 01:38:31,769
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're still putting your proposal for a special election out there, Maury?

1219
01:38:32,229 --> 01:38:32,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1220
01:38:32,570 --> 01:38:33,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1221
01:38:34,052 --> 01:38:35,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Ron and Gene, did you have comments?

1222
01:38:36,581 --> 01:38:39,162
[SPEAKER_11]: I just have a quick comment.

1223
01:38:39,402 --> 01:38:45,725
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's important that, to David's point, this is the end-all be-all to have to do a special election.

1224
01:38:46,265 --> 01:38:56,549
[SPEAKER_11]: I think one of the pieces we're missing here is, there's legal ramifications of an election, how long it takes to notify, to nominate, to all that stuff.

1225
01:38:56,809 --> 01:38:59,911
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would suggest the language would be,

1226
01:39:00,631 --> 01:39:12,561
[SPEAKER_11]: that in that case, the final case, we would establish a special election with the results to be available prior to June 30th of an election year.

1227
01:39:14,262 --> 01:39:15,383
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the thing.

1228
01:39:15,403 --> 01:39:17,224
[SPEAKER_11]: They can figure out how to do it themselves.

1229
01:39:17,525 --> 01:39:26,592
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to just vote on whether we want to put in special elections for city council in the case of someone who ran not being able to take the seat before.

1230
01:39:26,672 --> 01:39:28,874
[SPEAKER_02]: Then if we say yes, we can decide the details.

1231
01:39:31,708 --> 01:39:32,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that okay?

1232
01:39:32,449 --> 01:39:33,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that sound okay?

1233
01:39:34,089 --> 01:39:40,273
[SPEAKER_07]: So then the alternative then is that if we don't do a special election, the seat just simply remains vacant.

1234
01:39:40,833 --> 01:39:41,113
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1235
01:39:41,673 --> 01:39:43,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now we have the city council appointing.

1236
01:39:44,375 --> 01:39:44,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1237
01:39:47,416 --> 01:39:47,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1238
01:39:47,876 --> 01:39:52,739
[SPEAKER_02]: So special elections for city council under the circumstances we discussed.

1239
01:39:54,099 --> 01:39:55,440
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're in favor, yes.

1240
01:39:55,580 --> 01:39:57,101
[SPEAKER_02]: If not, no.

1241
01:39:57,241 --> 01:39:58,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Anthony, Andrea.

1242
01:39:59,182 --> 01:39:59,302
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

1243
01:40:01,177 --> 01:40:01,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Paulette.

1244
01:40:03,818 --> 01:40:04,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Who?

1245
01:40:05,179 --> 01:40:05,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Paulette.

1246
01:40:06,119 --> 01:40:06,360
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1247
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:08,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Eunice.

1248
01:40:10,841 --> 01:40:11,082
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1249
01:40:12,902 --> 01:40:13,342
[SPEAKER_02]: Phyllis.

1250
01:40:13,983 --> 01:40:14,203
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1251
01:40:14,843 --> 01:40:15,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Danielle.

1252
01:40:16,744 --> 01:40:16,944
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1253
01:40:18,325 --> 01:40:18,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Jean.

1254
01:40:19,525 --> 01:40:19,765
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1255
01:40:21,286 --> 01:40:21,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Ron.

1256
01:40:22,326 --> 01:40:22,566
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1257
01:40:24,107 --> 01:40:24,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Maury.

1258
01:40:24,907 --> 01:40:25,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1259
01:40:26,268 --> 01:40:26,708
[SPEAKER_02]: David.

1260
01:40:28,389 --> 01:40:28,489
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

1261
01:40:29,862 --> 01:40:34,446
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to also be no, just for the reasons that have been laid out.

1262
01:40:35,127 --> 01:40:38,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so that's that.

1263
01:40:39,110 --> 01:40:41,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody have anything else for section two?

1264
01:40:45,415 --> 01:40:48,438
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, Jean, did you have your hand up?

1265
01:40:51,119 --> 01:41:05,336
[SPEAKER_08]: For the special election, I had a question about special elections, but we can hold it to the citizen petition, but we do have all the citizen initiative petition work is by special election.

1266
01:41:07,198 --> 01:41:09,881
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm just raising that as something we need.

1267
01:41:13,181 --> 01:41:16,022
[SPEAKER_08]: You just said that it's very costly to do for the city.

1268
01:41:17,562 --> 01:41:20,662
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was wondering why we didn't just put it on the next ballot.

1269
01:41:20,722 --> 01:41:21,363
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know.

1270
01:41:21,383 --> 01:41:22,283
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm looking ahead.

1271
01:41:22,303 --> 01:41:22,343
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

1272
01:41:23,623 --> 01:41:26,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're going to, I mean, we only have 15 minutes.

1273
01:41:26,684 --> 01:41:29,944
[SPEAKER_02]: We're probably not going to get to Section 8, so keep that for the next meeting.

1274
01:41:31,384 --> 01:41:31,684
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

1275
01:41:31,924 --> 01:41:34,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Section 3, Article 3, I mean.

1276
01:41:35,345 --> 01:41:39,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody have any changes they want or amendments that they want to propose for Article 3?

1277
01:41:39,166 --> 01:41:39,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Daveed?

1278
01:41:42,904 --> 01:41:56,513
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so in the original version of Article 3-10, the Collins Center removed from the list of possible appointed mayors temporarily, they removed the department heads.

1279
01:41:58,135 --> 01:42:04,119
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had discussed in the committee the reasoning behind that being that department heads are in city hall every day.

1280
01:42:04,139 --> 01:42:10,163
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the most likely to know, to easily slide into the role of mayor in terms of just

1281
01:42:11,288 --> 01:42:13,769
[SPEAKER_00]: the executive functioning day-to-day, keeping things running.

1282
01:42:14,669 --> 01:42:22,792
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I completely understand the Colin Spencer argument that you shouldn't take unelected people and put them into what would otherwise be elected positions.

1283
01:42:23,312 --> 01:42:32,355
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the other hand, for just like easiness of the city hall running, I think it's possible the department heads would be a really good choice.

1284
01:42:33,215 --> 01:42:35,636
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm suggesting that we put the department heads back in there.

1285
01:42:36,600 --> 01:42:40,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so your proposal is to add that back in.

1286
01:42:42,041 --> 01:42:49,543
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess my question for the Collins Center is, when you made the recommendation, was there any legal reason for making that recommendation?

1287
01:42:51,704 --> 01:42:55,404
[SPEAKER_09]: There was no... Oh, Marilyn, is that... Were you going ahead?

1288
01:42:56,745 --> 01:42:57,665
[SPEAKER_13]: No, go ahead.

1289
01:42:59,189 --> 01:43:00,650
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, there was no legal reason.

1290
01:43:01,490 --> 01:43:02,650
[SPEAKER_09]: There was no legal prohibition.

1291
01:43:02,910 --> 01:43:07,392
[SPEAKER_09]: And Daveed correctly sort of articulated our arguments against it.

1292
01:43:07,412 --> 01:43:09,632
[SPEAKER_09]: So there was no legal prohibition.

1293
01:43:11,113 --> 01:43:27,918
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so the proposal on the table is to add back in department heads as possible replace, as possibilities for filling mayoral vacancies.

1294
01:43:28,248 --> 01:43:28,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

1295
01:43:30,810 --> 01:43:32,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that sound right, David?

1296
01:43:36,054 --> 01:43:37,755
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's correct.

1297
01:43:38,916 --> 01:43:39,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1298
01:43:39,936 --> 01:43:40,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1299
01:43:40,037 --> 01:43:44,400
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yes means that you want to add that back in.

1300
01:43:44,420 --> 01:43:46,061
[SPEAKER_02]: No means you don't.

1301
01:43:48,643 --> 01:43:48,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Ron?

1302
01:43:48,923 --> 01:43:51,425
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I ask just a question before we vote?

1303
01:43:52,105 --> 01:43:53,506
[SPEAKER_01]: I see the potential for, you know,

1304
01:43:55,042 --> 01:44:16,713
[SPEAKER_01]: a palace cool power struggle type of thing in a situation like that, I think there's good reason not to include, you know, department heads in the replacing of a mayor under, you know, whatever type of conditions, you know.

1305
01:44:19,038 --> 01:44:19,538
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

1306
01:44:19,598 --> 01:44:30,365
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's, you know, you can really, if you dig deep into it, there might be, there may be more to it, you know.

1307
01:44:30,385 --> 01:44:31,346
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I wanted to say.

1308
01:44:31,766 --> 01:44:32,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1309
01:44:33,107 --> 01:44:33,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1310
01:44:33,767 --> 01:44:37,150
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to go just the way my Zoom boxes are.

1311
01:44:37,630 --> 01:44:37,950
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1312
01:44:37,970 --> 01:44:39,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.

1313
01:44:39,131 --> 01:44:45,055
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think those people would be appointed as acting mayor, which has a lot fewer powers, right?

1314
01:44:46,122 --> 01:44:52,327
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree that, like, if you were appointing them to fill out the role of mayor for a two-year term or something, I would agree that that's problematic.

1315
01:44:52,387 --> 01:44:56,911
[SPEAKER_00]: But, like, in terms of acting mayor, I think that's somebody who just kind of keeps the lights on.

1316
01:44:58,091 --> 01:45:03,536
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think they could give their best friend a gigantic raise or something like that within their powers.

1317
01:45:04,376 --> 01:45:04,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1318
01:45:05,597 --> 01:45:15,125
[SPEAKER_02]: So the vote is to add back in department heads as possibilities for filling a mayoral vacancy as acting mayor.

1319
01:45:16,421 --> 01:45:17,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Maury.

1320
01:45:17,782 --> 01:45:18,022
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1321
01:45:19,923 --> 01:45:20,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Ron.

1322
01:45:21,904 --> 01:45:24,445
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, Milda, you have a couple of people with their hands up.

1323
01:45:24,465 --> 01:45:30,728
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you want to acknowledge them or... Um, do you want to say something?

1324
01:45:31,709 --> 01:45:32,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to say something?

1325
01:45:32,689 --> 01:45:33,950
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to finish the vote.

1326
01:45:34,410 --> 01:45:35,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this about the vote?

1327
01:45:35,691 --> 01:45:36,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1328
01:45:36,911 --> 01:45:37,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1329
01:45:38,072 --> 01:45:38,712
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll hold the vote.

1330
01:45:39,552 --> 01:45:40,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, Phyllis.

1331
01:45:41,200 --> 01:45:50,025
[SPEAKER_04]: So my question becomes then, if department has become eligible to be put into this, you know, temporary position, then what happens to the department?

1332
01:45:50,866 --> 01:45:54,448
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we already have one vacancy, we have that void there.

1333
01:45:55,048 --> 01:46:00,031
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we go down another level, and we take someone who's ahead of a department out of there and put it in there.

1334
01:46:00,111 --> 01:46:03,613
[SPEAKER_04]: So is there any, was there any conversation about

1335
01:46:05,116 --> 01:46:18,981
[SPEAKER_04]: that type of scenario playing, you know, and I know it's temporary and I know David made that good point, but still to me, as having been a department chair on a small, small scale, I'm sure, but what happens to that department then?

1336
01:46:19,301 --> 01:46:21,122
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have to go find a replacement for that?

1337
01:46:22,062 --> 01:46:23,983
[SPEAKER_04]: The kind of the domino effect kind of thing.

1338
01:46:25,943 --> 01:46:26,304
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1339
01:46:27,324 --> 01:46:31,205
[SPEAKER_00]: So I imagine they could either continue acting as acting mayor as well.

1340
01:46:31,225 --> 01:46:33,086
[SPEAKER_00]: They can do both jobs.

1341
01:46:34,100 --> 01:46:35,482
[SPEAKER_00]: assuming they're willing to, right?

1342
01:46:35,962 --> 01:46:46,717
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I imagine they could, you know, have a deputy, just like they might if they go on vacation for two months, have, you know, a deputy take over for that period of time, or two weeks, two months on vacation.

1343
01:46:49,972 --> 01:46:50,592
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a question.

1344
01:46:51,313 --> 01:46:52,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead, Paula.

1345
01:46:53,134 --> 01:46:57,718
[SPEAKER_03]: So some department chairs live in Medford, and other department chairs don't live in Medford.

1346
01:46:58,238 --> 01:47:02,241
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you're setting up an inequality right there.

1347
01:47:02,261 --> 01:47:10,627
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, to me, it would make more sense that the head of the city council would step in.

1348
01:47:12,508 --> 01:47:14,169
[SPEAKER_03]: The idea of putting a department chair in

1349
01:47:17,172 --> 01:47:19,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Is puzzling to me that they're not elected.

1350
01:47:20,555 --> 01:47:24,139
[SPEAKER_00]: To be clear, to be clear, this is just giving the city council the ability.

1351
01:47:24,259 --> 01:47:28,363
[SPEAKER_00]: So, they already the current language gives them the ability to choose among the city council.

1352
01:47:28,963 --> 01:47:30,945
[SPEAKER_00]: Right and acting there, right?

1353
01:47:31,226 --> 01:47:37,832
[SPEAKER_00]: So, they couldn't choose the president of the city council, or if the president wants to say president, they can choose somebody else more appropriate.

1354
01:47:38,613 --> 01:47:38,713
[SPEAKER_00]: Um.

1355
01:47:39,183 --> 01:47:45,508
[SPEAKER_00]: What this would add was, in addition to being able to choose a city councilor, they could instead choose a department head.

1356
01:47:46,029 --> 01:47:47,010
[SPEAKER_03]: Who lives in Medford.

1357
01:47:47,070 --> 01:47:49,011
[SPEAKER_00]: It would not require them to be the department head.

1358
01:47:49,612 --> 01:47:50,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, would they live in Medford?

1359
01:47:51,413 --> 01:47:57,058
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so I assume, you know, I don't know if we put that as a requirement for acting mayor.

1360
01:47:57,158 --> 01:48:05,305
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like the thing I was thinking through when we discussed this was simply, I think the acting mayor is somebody who keeps the lights on.

1361
01:48:06,026 --> 01:48:06,987
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you want somebody

1362
01:48:07,992 --> 01:48:12,813
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want somebody who's in the building every day and who's attending meetings with mayor all the time.

1363
01:48:12,853 --> 01:48:14,674
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they know what those things look like.

1364
01:48:16,494 --> 01:48:23,016
[SPEAKER_00]: In the same way that like, if you want to replace the CEO of a company, you probably choose another executive.

1365
01:48:23,056 --> 01:48:26,937
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't choose a member of the board because the members of the board are just not in there every day.

1366
01:48:27,157 --> 01:48:31,979
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you might choose a member of the board because you trust them and they're already folks who are, you know, whatever.

1367
01:48:32,419 --> 01:48:33,519
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just giving them more options.

1368
01:48:33,719 --> 01:48:34,879
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.

1369
01:48:34,899 --> 01:48:35,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1370
01:48:35,379 --> 01:48:37,260
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we clear on what we're voting on now?

1371
01:48:39,365 --> 01:48:41,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, Maury, did you have a question about this?

1372
01:48:42,266 --> 01:48:42,806
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I do.

1373
01:48:42,846 --> 01:48:51,750
[SPEAKER_06]: My comment was we already have a protocol in place that I believe the president of the city council takes the takes on the role of the.

1374
01:48:53,226 --> 01:49:03,289
[SPEAKER_06]: acting mayor or interim mayor until either, you know, our special election or however we choose to handle it.

1375
01:49:03,449 --> 01:49:10,790
[SPEAKER_06]: But, I mean, to stop bringing in department heads and so forth like that, to me, it's a little risqué.

1376
01:49:11,491 --> 01:49:11,831
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1377
01:49:12,351 --> 01:49:13,371
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's do the vote.

1378
01:49:14,811 --> 01:49:15,852
[SPEAKER_02]: We know what we're voting on.

1379
01:49:16,332 --> 01:49:17,592
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to restart the vote.

1380
01:49:18,092 --> 01:49:18,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Maury?

1381
01:49:19,713 --> 01:49:19,833
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1382
01:49:23,217 --> 01:49:24,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1383
01:49:25,038 --> 01:49:25,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Ron.

1384
01:49:26,299 --> 01:49:26,519
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

1385
01:49:27,659 --> 01:49:27,940
[SPEAKER_02]: Jean.

1386
01:49:28,820 --> 01:49:29,060
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1387
01:49:30,461 --> 01:49:30,861
[SPEAKER_02]: Danielle.

1388
01:49:31,842 --> 01:49:32,002
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

1389
01:49:33,443 --> 01:49:33,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Phyllis.

1390
01:49:34,583 --> 01:49:36,384
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1391
01:49:36,504 --> 01:49:36,805
[SPEAKER_02]: Eunice.

1392
01:49:37,765 --> 01:49:39,106
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1393
01:49:39,186 --> 01:49:39,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Paulette.

1394
01:49:40,066 --> 01:49:40,226
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1395
01:49:41,447 --> 01:49:41,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Anthony.

1396
01:49:41,987 --> 01:49:42,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Andrea.

1397
01:49:43,328 --> 01:49:43,528
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

1398
01:49:44,449 --> 01:49:44,789
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1399
01:49:45,269 --> 01:49:46,150
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll also vote no.

1400
01:49:46,410 --> 01:49:46,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1401
01:49:46,870 --> 01:49:48,151
[SPEAKER_02]: So we will not add that back.

1402
01:49:49,471 --> 01:49:51,993
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody have anything else on article three?

1403
01:49:53,607 --> 01:49:59,112
[SPEAKER_07]: I had one quick thing on the term of office.

1404
01:50:00,112 --> 01:50:03,435
[SPEAKER_07]: Just looking for some clarity, I think.

1405
01:50:04,456 --> 01:50:13,283
[SPEAKER_07]: We said that the term of office for the mayor shall be four years, so they're term limited.

1406
01:50:16,045 --> 01:50:18,226
[SPEAKER_07]: Given when this charter could

1407
01:50:19,242 --> 01:50:45,865
[SPEAKER_07]: go into effect a few years down the road, did we make a provision or should there be, if the mayor, our current mayor, Brianna, she's on her third term already, if depending upon when this charter goes into effect, what happens with the sitting mayor?

1408
01:50:46,903 --> 01:50:48,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Are they already term limited out?

1409
01:50:49,805 --> 01:50:51,526
[SPEAKER_07]: Or does the clock reset?

1410
01:50:52,827 --> 01:50:59,652
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know that, I think that this got talked about at some point, and I don't remember if there was any resolution made.

1411
01:50:59,672 --> 01:51:04,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Holland Center, is that in transitional provisions?

1412
01:51:07,437 --> 01:51:14,002
[SPEAKER_13]: The clock resets because the charter wasn't in effect when she was elected.

1413
01:51:14,342 --> 01:51:16,063
[SPEAKER_13]: She was elected under the old charter.

1414
01:51:16,806 --> 01:51:21,410
[SPEAKER_13]: So if she's running as a candidate under the new charter, it's a new clock.

1415
01:51:22,731 --> 01:51:33,599
[SPEAKER_07]: So by the time this charter would go into effect, if it went into effect as is, and she continues to seek reelection, she could be on her, you know, possibly sixth term by that point.

1416
01:51:35,420 --> 01:51:37,282
[SPEAKER_07]: So she could serve four more?

1417
01:51:38,383 --> 01:51:38,643
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1418
01:51:39,804 --> 01:51:40,124
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1419
01:51:42,146 --> 01:51:42,486
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1420
01:51:42,766 --> 01:51:44,347
[SPEAKER_07]: That was just the clarity I was looking for.

1421
01:51:44,387 --> 01:51:44,708
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1422
01:51:45,527 --> 01:51:46,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, great.

1423
01:51:46,612 --> 01:51:49,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody else have anything for article three?

1424
01:51:49,606 --> 01:51:50,289
[SPEAKER_02]: One more question.

1425
01:51:52,040 --> 01:51:56,964
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, in on, uh, 37 approval of the city mayor veto.

1426
01:51:57,644 --> 01:52:07,172
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, if the city council shall again pass the order ordinance resolution by vote of two thirds vote of the full council, it shall then take effect, notwithstanding the objections of the mayor.

1427
01:52:07,952 --> 01:52:21,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, does the, uh, if there's a financial impact, uh, something needs to be paid for, does, is there any obligation on the city council to explain how they're going to pay for it?

1428
01:52:29,075 --> 01:52:34,640
[SPEAKER_02]: do you have an answer to that?

1429
01:52:35,041 --> 01:52:45,270
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no requirement, under the language currently, there's no requirement that they sort of write some document explaining why they overrode the veto.

1430
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:52,516
[SPEAKER_09]: Presumably it happens at an open meeting, so whatever the discussion was that happened during the veto would be part of their minutes.

1431
01:52:56,524 --> 01:53:02,768
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand that part of this, I think, was because we want to limit the power of the mayor.

1432
01:53:03,669 --> 01:53:07,111
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait a minute.

1433
01:53:07,291 --> 01:53:08,852
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the veto was already in place.

1434
01:53:11,183 --> 01:53:12,504
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you read that again, please?

1435
01:53:12,544 --> 01:53:16,385
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm getting very confused on what we're talking about.

1436
01:53:16,566 --> 01:53:18,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, again, it may be in place.

1437
01:53:18,686 --> 01:53:19,367
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure.

1438
01:53:19,447 --> 01:53:22,068
[SPEAKER_03]: But when I'm reading this, I'm saying, well, that's interesting.

1439
01:53:22,168 --> 01:53:38,555
[SPEAKER_03]: So it says, if the city council shall again pass the ordinance, the order, ordinance or resolution or vote by two-thirds vote of the full council, it shall take effect notwithstanding the objections of the mayor.

1440
01:53:40,688 --> 01:53:41,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that happen now?

1441
01:53:41,608 --> 01:53:44,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think so.

1442
01:53:44,910 --> 01:53:50,512
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not subject to appropriations is still not, you know, it's separate.

1443
01:53:51,312 --> 01:53:51,852
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1444
01:53:52,193 --> 01:53:54,654
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, is this standard in other in other?

1445
01:53:54,994 --> 01:53:55,234
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1446
01:53:55,394 --> 01:53:55,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1447
01:53:55,934 --> 01:53:57,875
[SPEAKER_03]: That's okay.

1448
01:53:57,935 --> 01:53:58,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.

1449
01:53:58,675 --> 01:53:58,875
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

1450
01:53:58,895 --> 01:53:59,235
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1451
01:53:59,495 --> 01:54:02,817
[SPEAKER_07]: So how would that affect then a

1452
01:54:06,842 --> 01:54:09,263
[SPEAKER_07]: resolution for, say, an override.

1453
01:54:10,583 --> 01:54:24,247
[SPEAKER_07]: If the council wants an override and the mayor declines, can the city council then push it through with a vote?

1454
01:54:24,547 --> 01:54:26,048
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's governed by state law.

1455
01:54:26,838 --> 01:54:31,101
[SPEAKER_10]: And anything governed by state law, you'd have to look to the statute.

1456
01:54:31,321 --> 01:54:35,984
[SPEAKER_10]: And oftentimes they require both the city council and the mayor to approve things.

1457
01:54:37,065 --> 01:54:38,286
[SPEAKER_10]: Similar to special acts.

1458
01:54:40,407 --> 01:54:50,053
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't force a matter through oftentimes when the mayor is unwilling to go along with it.

1459
01:54:50,093 --> 01:54:51,654
[SPEAKER_10]: Similar to approval of this charter.

1460
01:54:51,715 --> 01:54:55,257
[SPEAKER_10]: If the city council were to say, yeah, it's great, and the mayor were to say no,

1461
01:54:56,104 --> 01:55:04,046
[SPEAKER_10]: they can't then override the mayor's veto of the new charter, so to speak, and go ahead and send it into the legislature.

1462
01:55:04,827 --> 01:55:05,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1463
01:55:05,127 --> 01:55:05,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1464
01:55:05,647 --> 01:55:08,908
[SPEAKER_02]: This provision is related to ordinances, correct?

1465
01:55:09,868 --> 01:55:11,829
[SPEAKER_02]: It says order ordinance resolution.

1466
01:55:12,629 --> 01:55:12,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1467
01:55:14,650 --> 01:55:15,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1468
01:55:15,210 --> 01:55:21,392
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we got through articles one through three, which is awesome, but we have many more articles to go.

1469
01:55:24,711 --> 01:55:35,384
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's come to the next meeting, really think through your amendments and come with them and try to be succinct and we'll get through the rest hopefully at the next meeting.

1470
01:55:35,404 --> 01:55:43,654
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm not going to call another meeting between now and September, and hopefully we won't have to call two meetings in September.

1471
01:55:44,555 --> 01:55:47,557
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's look to get through the rest of it at the next meeting.

1472
01:55:47,857 --> 01:55:51,239
[SPEAKER_02]: We also wanted to give a brief report on the final report subcommittee.

1473
01:55:52,120 --> 01:55:58,684
[SPEAKER_02]: The final report is in pretty good shape and we are going to share it with you all so you can read it.

1474
01:55:58,724 --> 01:55:59,865
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in

1475
01:56:02,308 --> 01:56:06,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Pieces right now, it's in many Google Docs, but we'll share that with you so you can read it.

1476
01:56:07,432 --> 01:56:11,955
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if anybody has any comments about that, we can look at the next meeting.

1477
01:56:11,975 --> 01:56:13,636
[SPEAKER_02]: We would have huge numbers.

1478
01:56:15,737 --> 01:56:18,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Eventually, eventually, eventually it will.

1479
01:56:19,520 --> 01:56:21,761
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't yet, but it will eventually.

1480
01:56:21,861 --> 01:56:25,224
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen others that don't and it drives me nutty.

1481
01:56:26,010 --> 01:56:27,451
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, I think it will eventually.

1482
01:56:28,931 --> 01:56:30,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Maury, did you have a question?

1483
01:56:30,152 --> 01:56:33,453
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, our next meeting is, what, September 5th?

1484
01:56:35,514 --> 01:56:37,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what, the first Thursday in September?

1485
01:56:37,875 --> 01:56:40,736
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's the week of Labor Day and back to school.

1486
01:56:40,797 --> 01:56:44,438
[SPEAKER_06]: Should we put, does that affect anybody or is that, they all go with that?

1487
01:56:46,319 --> 01:56:48,900
[SPEAKER_02]: How do people feel about September 5th?

1488
01:56:49,720 --> 01:56:50,081
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm good.

1489
01:56:50,721 --> 01:56:53,322
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the Thursday after Labor Day.

1490
01:56:54,222 --> 01:56:55,423
[SPEAKER_02]: September 12th would be better.

1491
01:56:56,305 --> 01:56:56,826
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think.

1492
01:56:57,968 --> 01:57:03,278
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, we we sort of have a set schedule and we tell everyone, you know, where.

1493
01:57:03,298 --> 01:57:08,468
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we could change it if a lot of people who cannot come on September 5th.

1494
01:57:11,670 --> 01:57:16,974
[SPEAKER_00]: My worry would be that if we pushed it to September 12th and then had to schedule a second meeting for the month, that would be really close.

1495
01:57:16,994 --> 01:57:17,354
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're right.

1496
01:57:17,374 --> 01:57:19,875
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're going to keep it on September 5th.

1497
01:57:20,236 --> 01:57:20,656
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fine.

1498
01:57:20,736 --> 01:57:22,958
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to bring it up in case people had any questions.

1499
01:57:23,398 --> 01:57:23,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1500
01:57:23,678 --> 01:57:24,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no.

1501
01:57:24,479 --> 01:57:25,159
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Maury.

1502
01:57:26,520 --> 01:57:32,484
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, and the Ethics Subcommittee will meet, and we'll get language together.

1503
01:57:32,644 --> 01:57:38,608
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll have the Collins Center look at the language, and then we can vote on the addition of that language next time too.

1504
01:57:39,947 --> 01:57:42,828
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, does anybody have anything else before we close?

1505
01:57:44,128 --> 01:57:47,209
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I would really just like to say thank you to everybody on this group.

1506
01:57:47,229 --> 01:57:49,669
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot of work, your people are doing it.

1507
01:57:49,769 --> 01:57:51,750
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean that sincerely, thank you, everybody.

1508
01:57:52,390 --> 01:57:53,590
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, thank you, everyone.

1509
01:57:53,610 --> 01:57:57,331
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we're all doing well.

1510
01:57:57,351 --> 01:57:59,092
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm hoping that we can, you know,

1511
01:58:00,034 --> 01:58:01,956
[SPEAKER_07]: celebrate the fruits of our labor when we're done.

1512
01:58:02,536 --> 01:58:02,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1513
01:58:02,937 --> 01:58:03,377
[SPEAKER_02]: And thanks.

1514
01:58:03,557 --> 01:58:04,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks to the call center.

1515
01:58:05,018 --> 01:58:14,767
[SPEAKER_02]: And it'd be great if you also could come back next time so that we can get through the rest of the, uh, get through the rest of the charter, which I think we're going to be able to do at the next meeting.

1516
01:58:15,288 --> 01:58:15,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1517
01:58:15,848 --> 01:58:16,489
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm confident.

1518
01:58:17,750 --> 01:58:19,651
[SPEAKER_02]: She says, love your confidence.

1519
01:58:19,671 --> 01:58:20,452
[SPEAKER_11]: The call center.

1520
01:58:20,532 --> 01:58:20,852
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1521
01:58:26,637 --> 01:58:29,999
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you been retained by the city council to work with them on their charter?

1522
01:58:33,100 --> 01:58:35,781
[SPEAKER_09]: At this point we're only working with this committee on the charter.

1523
01:58:36,101 --> 01:58:36,482
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1524
01:58:37,182 --> 01:58:38,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you been approached by them though?

1525
01:58:40,583 --> 01:58:41,624
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't believe so.

1526
01:58:42,164 --> 01:58:43,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you.

1527
01:58:45,686 --> 01:58:48,707
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, motion to adjourn.

1528
01:58:49,588 --> 01:58:49,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Second.

1529
01:58:51,058 --> 01:58:53,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Did some, okay, all in favor?

1530
01:58:53,885 --> 01:58:54,427
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

1531
01:58:54,507 --> 01:58:55,870
[SPEAKER_02]: See you all soon.

1532
01:58:56,131 --> 01:58:56,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
