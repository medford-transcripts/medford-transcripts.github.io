1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:03,651
Forgot the meeting was on zoom just head home.

2
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:14,078
Everyone.

3
00:00:19,101 --> 00:00:24,325
Dr cushing, I had some trouble getting in via the link that was.

4
00:00:26,852 --> 00:00:30,897
On the agenda on the website, so just.

5
00:00:32,019 --> 00:00:32,860
I was unsuccessful.

6
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:38,847
Somebody sent me a separate link and I got here, but so I don't know if there was just something strange happening on my end, but I think.

7
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:41,019
Oh, OK, great.

8
00:00:41,279 --> 00:00:46,001
I just want to make sure if other people are trying to get in that they don't sort of get stuck.

9
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:49,942
So if you all hear of anybody else having a problem, let us know.

10
00:00:50,422 --> 00:00:53,043
Will, could you post an updated link to our Facebook page?

11
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:55,103
But also, I noticed member Branley's not here.

12
00:00:55,203 --> 00:00:57,644
So perhaps we could send it directly to her.

13
00:00:58,724 --> 00:00:59,625
I can do that right now.

14
00:01:00,205 --> 00:01:03,606
Yeah, I just posted the dial location instead of the hyperlink.

15
00:01:03,626 --> 00:01:04,366
But I'll do that now.

16
00:01:04,766 --> 00:01:05,106
Thank you.

17
00:01:05,386 --> 00:01:07,127
And I'll send it to member Branley immediately.

18
00:01:11,576 --> 00:01:15,640
Okay.

19
00:01:17,021 --> 00:01:20,825
I'm going to get us started.

20
00:01:20,845 --> 00:01:27,731
I know the mayor is in transit, so she'll be with us in just a few when she's not in transit anymore.

I don't know if she can unmute yet.

44
00:02:43,876 --> 00:02:45,037
Give her just one second.

45
00:02:45,117 --> 00:02:45,697
We can call her.

46
00:02:53,443 --> 00:02:54,884
Member Brandley, yes.

47
00:02:56,225 --> 00:02:57,226

00:02:57,246 --> 00:02:57,286
OK.

49
00:02:57,967 --> 00:03:01,830
OK, seven present, zero absent.

50
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,042
Um, all rise to salute the flag.

51
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:19,813
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.

52
00:03:26,397 --> 00:03:26,818
Okay.

00:03:27,118 --> 00:03:29,140

00:03:31,842 --> 00:03:33,504
Any comments from the committee?

56
00:03:43,553 --> 00:03:48,938
We'll just say that the annual conference is later this week.

57
00:03:48,998 --> 00:03:53,642
Thank you to all the committee members for taking time out of their day to days.

58
00:03:54,003 --> 00:03:57,226
We're all to attend later this week in hiatus.

59
00:03:58,622 --> 00:04:01,483
And, um, we will move on to the consent agenda.

60
00:04:01,684 --> 00:04:03,745
So item number four is the consent agenda.

63
00:04:23,834 --> 00:04:26,015

00:05:57,612 --> 00:06:01,196
Um, the special meeting on October 28th member.

104
00:06:01,356 --> 00:06:04,259
So, did you have a question or comment?

Yes, the votes of the meeting are listed as 5-2, which implies 5 in the affirmative, 2 in the negative.

106
00:06:14,863 --> 00:06:19,585
It was actually 5 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative, 2 were absent.

107
00:06:20,786 --> 00:06:25,548
The minutes have actually already been updated by Lisa and updated in our drive.

108
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:27,610
But I just wanted to note that.

109
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:30,271

00:07:01,067 --> 00:07:06,134
Uh, and onto item number six, which is the report of the superintendent.

124
00:07:06,254 --> 00:07:10,940
So, um, number one, the superintendent updates and comments, Dr. Maurice Edward Vincent.

125
00:07:12,782 --> 00:07:13,242
Thank you.

126
00:07:13,342 --> 00:07:14,023
And good evening.

127
00:07:15,025 --> 00:07:16,046
Good evening to everyone.

128
00:07:17,543 --> 00:07:21,306
It is great to be with you all tonight for this evening's school committee meeting.

129
00:07:22,147 --> 00:07:30,613
While we normally hold our sessions in person, tonight we are on Zoom while our great city finalizes its preparation for tomorrow.

130
00:07:32,234 --> 00:07:38,419
Ahead of election day, I want to begin my remarks tonight by speaking about the importance of voting.

131
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:47,166
Voting is essential because it empowers you to express your beliefs and shape the future of our local community.

132
00:07:48,254 --> 00:07:50,996
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and our country.

133
00:07:51,796 --> 00:07:59,261
It's not just a right, but a civic duty, allowing you to initiate change and advocate for your community.

134
00:08:00,082 --> 00:08:02,123
Your vote is your voice.

135
00:08:03,564 --> 00:08:11,890
Information on where to vote, what is on the ballot, and when polls open are available on the City of Medford's website.

136
00:08:13,345 --> 00:08:20,990
And as a result of election day tomorrow, Medford Public Schools will be closed for all students tomorrow.

137
00:08:21,771 --> 00:08:32,558
However, staff will be present at all of our school campuses as one of our scheduled professional development dates is taking place tomorrow.

138
00:08:34,304 --> 00:08:43,487
Our educators have been doing a marvelous job supporting our students' social, emotional, and educational journey so far this year.

139
00:08:44,887 --> 00:08:53,509
Myself and all of our other administrators are looking forward to connecting with our staff tomorrow during our Professional Development Day.

140
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:58,551
So I'd like to just rewind a little bit over the past few weeks.

141
00:08:59,795 --> 00:09:17,787
I want to thank all of our administrators, elected officials, City Year partners, building staff, and community leaders for reading to our Missittuck students in late October as part of the Jumpstart Read for the record day.

142
00:09:19,148 --> 00:09:27,834
Our Missittuck students were part of over 2 million readers across the world who enjoyed this year's book, Piper Chen Sings.

143
00:09:29,437 --> 00:09:37,781
I'd also like to extend a special thank you to all of our community members who joined our students during last month's Walking Wednesdays.

144
00:09:38,921 --> 00:09:51,447
Students enjoyed the presence of fellow peers and caregivers on Wednesdays throughout October while all walking to school, including the National Walk and Bike to School Day on October 9th.

145
00:09:52,627 --> 00:09:58,790
These outdoor commutes to school took place at all of our elementary and middle schools.

146
00:10:00,788 --> 00:10:21,296
I am also very, very excited to share good news that happened yesterday afternoon, where our Medford Mustang Marching Band won the Division II New England Scholastic Band Association Championship for the second year in a row.

147
00:10:22,725 --> 00:10:37,589
Performing their 2024 show, After the Rain, our band won Caption Awards for Best Visual Performance, Best Color Guard, and Best Overall Effect.

148
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:46,912
Additionally, students Qian Liao and Benjamin Verz received the award for Best Drum Majors.

149
00:10:47,472 --> 00:10:48,893
Congratulations to them.

150
00:10:49,924 --> 00:11:01,152
Our Mustangs also claimed the top spot with a Platinum Award and a score of 95.37, making them the only band in Division I, II, or III to achieve a Platinum Award.

151
00:11:11,243 --> 00:11:19,150
The band includes students from Medford High School, Medford Vocational School, and both the Andrews and McGlynn Middle Schools.

152
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:32,341
Congratulations to all of our students and our first year band director in Medford Public Schools, Mr. Michael Dampier, on a fantastic, fantastic fall season.

153
00:11:32,821 --> 00:11:34,222
So congratulations to them.

154
00:11:34,282 --> 00:11:37,265
And here they are with all of their wonderful awards.

155
00:11:39,551 --> 00:11:43,633
I also want to just quickly jump over to athletics to share some great news.

156
00:11:45,133 --> 00:11:53,217
Our football team continued their memorable season with another history-making performance.

157
00:11:53,737 --> 00:12:05,122
Yes, our senior, Brianna Cerullo, became the first female in Mustang football history to score in a varsity game.

158
00:12:06,002 --> 00:12:11,771
punching in a two-yard run during our 38-6 win over Chelsea.

159
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,475
So that's a huge congratulations, Brianna.

160
00:12:15,116 --> 00:12:20,984
Brianna is just the second female to participate in football at the varsity level.

161
00:12:21,605 --> 00:12:26,749
in school history and the first one to find her way to the end zone.

162
00:12:27,589 --> 00:12:32,953
Congratulations to Brianna for having your name live in Mustang lore forever.

163
00:12:33,673 --> 00:12:46,182
I would also like to extend my sincerest admiration to our football team for fostering an inclusive and welcoming environment for all of our students.

164
00:12:48,015 --> 00:12:49,376
So congratulations to them.

165
00:12:50,156 --> 00:13:06,284
In the spirit of congratulations, I'd also like to take a moment to congratulate our Medford rowing team on a superb fall season that culminated at the MPSRA Fall Championship.

166
00:13:07,145 --> 00:13:11,467
Our crew team won two gold, one silver,

167
00:13:12,003 --> 00:13:15,567
and two bronze medals at the state championship.

168
00:13:16,268 --> 00:13:24,757
Medford High School also won the Massachusetts State Team Sculling Trophy for the first time in school history.

169
00:13:26,249 --> 00:13:31,334
And last but not least, hot off the press, just came downstairs from the game.

170
00:13:31,655 --> 00:13:36,860
Our unified basketball team just won their game upstairs.

171
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,061
It was wonderful.

172
00:13:38,081 --> 00:13:41,845
And I want to thank Mayor Longo Kern and Member Ntapa.

173
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:50,049
for being upstairs supporting our unified basketball team and our wonderful band played.

174
00:13:50,349 --> 00:13:51,589
They sounded fabulous.

175
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:57,552
It was a great victory, a great game, a great night for Mustang Nation.

176
00:13:58,012 --> 00:14:03,175
So I want to just thank and congratulate all of our Mustangs for a terrific fall season.

177
00:14:03,615 --> 00:14:07,096
Yes, we give them a shout out, clapping for all of you.

178
00:14:07,176 --> 00:14:08,497
Keep up the great, great work.

179
00:14:10,501 --> 00:14:21,351
As I continue with my announcements, just for everyone to be aware, next Monday, November 11th, Medford Public Schools will be closed in honor of Veterans Day.

180
00:14:21,371 --> 00:14:29,858
This Veterans Day, we honor and thank all the brave men and women who have served in our military.

181
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:36,304
Their sacrifices and dedication protect our freedoms and ensure our safety.

182
00:14:38,001 --> 00:14:50,019
Please take a moment next Monday to reflect on their courage and commitment while recognizing the importance of supporting our veterans, both during and after their service.

183
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,264
Thank you sincerely to all of our veterans.

184
00:14:55,296 --> 00:15:15,773
On Tuesday, September 12th, Medford Public Schools and CCSR, the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility, will be hosting a dedication ceremony for the new Crystal Campbell Memorial Garden at three o'clock, which will be taking place at the front of Medford High School.

185
00:15:17,074 --> 00:15:21,698
The new garden will honor Crystal, a 2001 Medford High School graduate,

186
00:15:22,489 --> 00:15:27,992
who tragically passed away during the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing.

187
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:34,536
The Memorial Garden will celebrate her life and passion for bringing people together.

188
00:15:35,336 --> 00:15:42,200
Light refreshments will be served following the dedication ceremony and all members of the public are welcome to attend.

189
00:15:44,462 --> 00:15:47,924
Lastly, I wanna just provide some brief MSBA updates.

190
00:15:48,948 --> 00:16:01,238
I want to inform the committee and the community that MSBA will be visiting our schools beginning next week as part of the state's school survey assessment.

191
00:16:02,199 --> 00:16:12,287
The MSBA will be visiting all schools in the Commonwealth during the next year, except schools that are in the MSBA program pipeline.

192
00:16:13,126 --> 00:16:24,177
So as a result, they will not be visiting Medford High School, given the ongoing new high school building process, but they will be visiting all of our other schools.

193
00:16:25,967 --> 00:16:46,195
The school surveys of approximately 1,580 schools in Massachusetts will result in a published report by the MSBA, which will detail a shared understanding of the building condition and general environment for all of the Commonwealth's public schools.

194
00:16:47,182 --> 00:16:57,547
The assessment will evaluate several key factors including condition, capacity, maintenance, and educational environment.

195
00:16:58,888 --> 00:17:05,091
The last school survey of all schools in the Commonwealth was held in 2016.

196
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:16,597
The MSBA school survey will begin next Tuesday and include walkthroughs of our schools and interviews with building leaders.

197
00:17:17,878 --> 00:17:24,644
These surveys, again, are independent of the ongoing process to build a new Medford High School.

198
00:17:25,465 --> 00:17:28,888
Rather, it is part of the statewide assessment.

199
00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:36,995
With that being said, we look forward to welcoming members of the MSBA team into all of our other schools.

200
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:51,707
And for this evening's meeting, I'm excited to join Dr. Galussi in sharing about what's happening in Medford Public Schools from our instructional vision, also to our MCAS performance.

201
00:17:52,288 --> 00:17:54,691
And this evening, Dr. Chiesa,

202
00:17:55,552 --> 00:17:55,732
Ms.

203
00:17:55,772 --> 00:18:02,498
Faiza Khan and Mr. Rocco Sieri, our Directors of Humanities, Mathematics, and Science.

204
00:18:03,098 --> 00:18:15,068
They will be reporting out to the committee on our MCAS testing data from the late spring of 2024 and share about our key takeaways and the results.

205
00:18:15,649 --> 00:18:15,989
Thank you.

206
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:28,060
Mary, do you want me to continue?

207
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:32,823
Either way, I was just pulling up the, I have the agenda up, but totally, yeah, if you could take the next one, that'd be great.

208
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:33,343
Sure.

209
00:18:34,284 --> 00:18:40,248
Item number two is a recommendation to approve a vehicle donation, approximate value of $1,000.

210
00:18:40,288 --> 00:18:43,890
Dr. Peter Cushing, assistant superintendent.

211
00:18:45,151 --> 00:18:45,792
Dr. Cushing?

212
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:53,177
Yep, just real quick, donating a 2011 Hyundai Santa Fe that the automotive department has worked on significantly.

213
00:18:54,261 --> 00:19:00,264
were offered it they said they would be happy to take it so simply approval of the school committee.

214
00:19:01,744 --> 00:19:02,404
Motion for approval.

215
00:19:04,645 --> 00:19:10,288
Motion to approve by Mayor Longo Kern seconded by Member Reinfeldt.

216
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:12,068
Roll call.

217
00:19:14,489 --> 00:19:15,090
Member Brandley.

218
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:16,090
Yes.

219
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:17,291
Member Graham.

220
00:19:17,711 --> 00:19:17,911
Yes.

221
00:19:18,531 --> 00:19:19,191
Member Antapa.

222
00:19:20,672 --> 00:19:20,932
Yes.

223
00:19:21,632 --> 00:19:22,353
Member Olopade.

224
00:19:22,913 --> 00:19:23,093
Yes.

225
00:19:24,224 --> 00:19:24,964
member right now.

226
00:19:25,325 --> 00:19:26,625
Yes, I remember.

227
00:19:26,645 --> 00:19:27,826
So yes, Marilyn go current.

228
00:19:28,246 --> 00:19:28,486
Yes.

229
00:19:30,167 --> 00:19:32,248
70 affirmative or negative motion passes.

230
00:19:33,929 --> 00:19:36,571
We have instructional vision for Metro Public Schools.

231
00:19:36,871 --> 00:19:44,755
I'll turn it over to Dr Maurice Edward Vincent, our superintendent and Dr Suzanne B. Galusi, assistant superintendent of curriculum and instruction.

232
00:19:51,984 --> 00:19:56,005
Yeah, I was gonna just, I will just tee it off and then we'll go back and forth.

233
00:19:56,045 --> 00:19:56,985
There is a slide deck.

234
00:19:57,005 --> 00:19:58,066
Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

235
00:20:00,347 --> 00:20:09,590
And this is a very brief slide deck talking about the instructional vision work that the Medford Public Schools is going to be working on, continuing to work on.

236
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:15,412
The work has already begun, but this is just to formally introduce it to the committee.

237
00:20:15,432 --> 00:20:18,994
And this body of work is going to be introduced

238
00:20:19,554 --> 00:20:28,097
formally to all staff officially tomorrow in a joint capacity during part of our professional development sessions.

239
00:20:28,717 --> 00:20:35,059
And so Dr. Galluzzi, I'm gonna pass the baton on to you and we can piggyback off of one another.

240
00:20:35,259 --> 00:20:35,559
Thank you.

241
00:20:36,135 --> 00:20:36,515
Perfect.

242
00:20:36,595 --> 00:20:37,376
Thank you very much.

243
00:20:38,316 --> 00:20:49,001
So as the superintendent said, thank you for this opportunity for us to present our, the work that's gone in to the creation of our districts instructional vision.

244
00:20:50,222 --> 00:20:51,742
If you could please advance to the next.

245
00:20:51,782 --> 00:20:52,203
Thank you.

246
00:20:52,263 --> 00:20:52,383
So,

247
00:20:53,443 --> 00:21:01,607
I think it's important to just highlight the work that has kind of culminated into creating our instructional vision.

248
00:21:02,168 --> 00:21:12,573
So in 2021, coming out of the pandemic, as a district, we really worked on aligning our common assessments and some of our common

249
00:21:14,594 --> 00:21:18,938
approaches to ensure that instruction meets the needs of our students.

250
00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:25,805
So in 2021 we saw the implementation of NWEA MAP as a district wide assessment tool.

251
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,467
I mean, at that point it was grades K through 10.

252
00:21:29,248 --> 00:21:33,492
We've slightly adapted that now to be grades 2 through 10, but that provides

253
00:21:34,082 --> 00:21:40,926
a common measure to ensure that we're meeting student needs and that we are standards-based.

254
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:53,913
We also saw the alignment of restorative practices, K through six, excuse me, six through 12, and the continued implementation of responsive classroom, K through five.

255
00:21:54,333 --> 00:22:03,278
So ensuring that our classrooms are setting that foundation for optimal learning, and then ensuring that our instruction and our materials are meeting

256
00:22:04,939 --> 00:22:07,141
state standards and national standards.

257
00:22:07,841 --> 00:22:14,306
In 2022, we really looked at the alignment of evaluation techniques.

258
00:22:14,807 --> 00:22:25,815
So we partnered with Rebus and the administrators really worked on aligning observational and evaluative feedback for our staff.

259
00:22:26,616 --> 00:22:40,825
We worked on creating core actions, and we created a crosswalk to ensure that our evaluative and observation work aligned with the superintendent's core actions at that time.

260
00:22:42,566 --> 00:22:49,490
Advancing to 2023, we really dug into our instructional alignment, calling it 1.0.

261
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:53,813
At this time, we were grounded in the work that we received from

262
00:22:54,639 --> 00:23:05,665
The desi air report into that analysis of the instructional pieces that we really had to work on as a district at the same time also engaging in.

263
00:23:07,293 --> 00:23:11,135
an instructional leadership seminar hosted by the Department of Education.

264
00:23:11,815 --> 00:23:18,798
So we created a series of professional development opportunities to align our instruction district-wide.

265
00:23:19,558 --> 00:23:23,680
That was titled right here, Moving Towards Opportunity for All Students.

266
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:35,505
And the bulk of that was given during staff meetings by our school leaders, and also followed up in department meetings by our directors.

267
00:23:37,518 --> 00:23:42,303
Advancing to this current year of 2024, that work is continuing.

268
00:23:42,964 --> 00:23:45,606
And between the August administrative time of 2023,

269
00:23:47,786 --> 00:24:11,219
And the June of 2024 and the August of 2024, administration engaged in all of this alignment work to create an instructional vision for the district, to ensure that we are really grounded in what we want to see for instruction in every classroom across the district, K through 12.

270
00:24:12,699 --> 00:24:22,768
So in continuing the professional development, we created, Dr. Cushing, if you don't mind, this took several iterations.

271
00:24:23,509 --> 00:24:32,377
So this began with group work in terms of elements that we wanted to really hone in on.

272
00:24:33,345 --> 00:24:40,148
to make sure that our students are receiving, and right down to the introductory equity statement at the top.

273
00:24:40,909 --> 00:24:47,132
This instructional vision, we believe, captures the priorities for teaching and learning district-wide.

274
00:24:48,412 --> 00:24:51,734
So there are four core quadrants, as you can see.

275
00:24:53,194 --> 00:24:58,917
To frame the entire instructional vision, the equity statement is as follows.

276
00:24:58,957 --> 00:25:02,579
We are committed to providing educational equity for every child.

277
00:25:02,932 --> 00:25:09,240
by offering the necessary resources, support, and opportunities for students to reach their full potential.

278
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:18,352
So first and foremost is high quality instruction, and that establishes high expectations for all students.

279
00:25:18,837 --> 00:25:21,018
that promote critical thinking and problem solving.

280
00:25:21,638 --> 00:25:35,382
It aligns to grade-level state standards and ensures that instruction meets the individual needs of students while maintaining grade-level standards, high rigor, and high instructional quality materials.

281
00:25:36,547 --> 00:25:40,110
We also want to ensure that our instruction is deeply engaging.

282
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:51,338
We want to create cognitively rich learning contexts that are supported by collaborative practices that connect learning to students' lives and to the real world.

283
00:25:52,419 --> 00:26:05,109
So students should be able to participate in learning opportunities that not only provide them with that rich context, but also make that connection to why this is important in real life.

284
00:26:06,819 --> 00:26:10,622
We also want to ensure that our instruction is data informed.

285
00:26:12,043 --> 00:26:13,424
So that is consistent.

286
00:26:13,745 --> 00:26:25,134
Educators should be consistently collecting and analyzing data to inform and adjust their instructional practices, ensuring that all students reach their full potential.

287
00:26:25,234 --> 00:26:32,601
So there are various sets of data that teachers are using constantly to inform their instructional approaches.

288
00:26:33,351 --> 00:26:44,573
It can be formative data that they're gathering throughout the lesson on a daily basis, as well as summative data, which we're going to talk about a little tonight.

289
00:26:45,273 --> 00:26:49,934
But some of that summative data is around the MAP, the NWEA MAP.

290
00:26:50,294 --> 00:26:51,275
It's unit tests.

291
00:26:52,155 --> 00:26:53,635
It's even part of MCAS.

292
00:26:53,975 --> 00:27:01,137
But making sure that they're collecting various forms of data and targeting their instruction to meet student needs.

293
00:27:02,317 --> 00:27:02,837
All of this

294
00:27:04,611 --> 00:27:12,473
should result in a sense of belonging for our students, which is the crux of why we're doing this.

295
00:27:15,094 --> 00:27:25,177
So we want educators to be using inclusive and culturally affirming instruction and curriculum that acknowledges students' backgrounds and identities.

296
00:27:25,877 --> 00:27:33,799
We want to ensure that an environment of connectedness is created where all students feel heard, valued,

297
00:27:34,284 --> 00:27:39,989
and supported in their identities and where relationships are built on empathy and respect.

298
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:50,238
We were very mindful that this display is circular because all four quadrants rely on one another.

299
00:27:50,858 --> 00:27:57,083
So we can't have belonging if our instruction is not high quality, deeply engaging.

300
00:27:57,904 --> 00:28:02,328
We can't have high quality instruction if we're not using data to inform our practices

301
00:28:03,068 --> 00:28:04,109
and vice versa.

302
00:28:04,669 --> 00:28:14,133
So as the superintendent mentioned, tomorrow is the PD day in which we're very excited for this.

303
00:28:14,213 --> 00:28:20,736
This whole entire professional development day was created by the Professional Development Advisory Committee.

304
00:28:20,836 --> 00:28:22,156
It's all choice-based.

305
00:28:22,696 --> 00:28:30,460
Our administrators are providing sessions in which the educators selected what they were interested in learning more about.

306
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:37,463
And within between those two sessions, we are spending some time on this instructional vision.

307
00:28:37,543 --> 00:28:57,834
So within small groups, educators will have the opportunity to engage a little bit more fully on the instructional vision and really be able to connect and give us feedback as to how they, how this means for their role in Medford Public Schools.

308
00:28:58,255 --> 00:29:00,216
And we're going to be able to have that data

309
00:29:01,041 --> 00:29:08,882
to inform our next steps as we work to actualize the instructional vision within our schools.

310
00:29:09,423 --> 00:29:16,284
So part of the next steps after the teachers engage with this work, provide us some feedback.

311
00:29:17,064 --> 00:29:28,486
We have a committee, an instructional vision committee that will also now take that data and hone in on what those observational look-fors should be.

312
00:29:29,502 --> 00:29:42,404
connected to our instructional vision so that when we are observing teachers and we're going on walkthroughs through our schools, we have something that reflects the instructional vision of the district.

313
00:29:42,425 --> 00:29:47,485
I don't know if you want to add anything onto that, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

314
00:29:48,426 --> 00:29:55,207
I just was going to actually piggyback and double down on the circle that

315
00:29:57,176 --> 00:30:08,461
Every piece of this circle depends on another piece of the circle and that it isn't a square and it's not, you pull one piece of the puzzle away, it's not going to work.

316
00:30:09,441 --> 00:30:19,786
And as we transition to the next presentation, when you hear about our MCAS data and how as a district we're making data informed decisions,

317
00:30:21,647 --> 00:30:25,410
And looking at what does our high quality instruction look like?

318
00:30:25,831 --> 00:30:27,772
What are the programs that we have in place?

319
00:30:28,693 --> 00:30:30,154
Everything is connected.

320
00:30:30,274 --> 00:30:36,399
If our students are not engaged, and they don't feel like they belong, they're not going to be interested in learning.

321
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:44,526
So there are a few really bright points that are going to be shared shortly by our team.

322
00:30:45,928 --> 00:30:51,474
But one of the things that I am very happy about is our growth, our student growth.

323
00:30:52,275 --> 00:31:02,346
We know we have other areas that we're going to work on, but our students, their starting point, and their ending point, they are showing significant growth.

324
00:31:03,456 --> 00:31:15,216
in almost all of our schools as a district, and the following presentation will show what that growth looks like, and we want to build upon that positive momentum.

325
00:31:16,567 --> 00:31:24,233
by making data informed decisions and ensuring that our students are engaged in the quality of instruction that they are receiving.

326
00:31:24,794 --> 00:31:34,041
I also just want to recognize Suzanne Fee for her artistic work in designing this instructional vision.

327
00:31:35,422 --> 00:31:57,710
It's visually appealing, easy to understand, and we are working on giving our staff and visitors, as it gets published and posted in all of our schools, an anchor to look at, an anchor chart to look at to understand what is actually happening right now in the Medford Public Schools and that everything is interrelated.

328
00:31:58,351 --> 00:32:01,132
And again, our goal is to have all students

329
00:32:01,812 --> 00:32:08,821
feel like they belong and know that they belong and know that they are part of the Medford Public Schools community.

330
00:32:09,222 --> 00:32:12,806
Because if our students feel connected, they will feel engaged.

331
00:32:13,826 --> 00:32:24,649
and they will feel like they belong, they will continue to produce positive outcomes, and we're gonna see the needle keep moving in the positive direction.

332
00:32:25,129 --> 00:32:34,072
So I just thank you, Suzanne, for your presentation there, and we're looking forward to this work, this next iteration of the work.

333
00:32:38,594 --> 00:32:39,754
Happy to answer any questions.

334
00:32:41,714 --> 00:32:45,017
Thank you very much, Dr. Edward Vincent and Dr. Galluzzi.

335
00:32:47,479 --> 00:32:49,881
Next up, we have number four.

336
00:32:55,806 --> 00:32:56,547
My agenda back.

337
00:33:08,456 --> 00:33:09,197
We have

338
00:33:10,729 --> 00:33:12,371
MCAS results.

339
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:15,513
Again, Dr. Galussi, Assistant Superintendent of Curriculum and Instruction.

340
00:33:17,395 --> 00:33:17,936
Thank you.

341
00:33:18,656 --> 00:33:19,397
Good evening again.

342
00:33:19,897 --> 00:33:25,883
As the superintendent previously mentioned, I'm honored to be joined by our curriculum directors.

343
00:33:26,003 --> 00:33:29,226
We have the Director of Humanities, Dr. Nicole Chiesa.

344
00:33:29,744 --> 00:33:34,826
the Director of Mathematics, Faiza Khan, and the Director of Science, Rako Sieri.

345
00:33:35,527 --> 00:33:43,871
And collectively, we will be presenting on the district's MCAS scores, accountability, and action steps as a result.

346
00:33:47,432 --> 00:33:49,133
So this is our agenda for this evening.

347
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:58,198
I just want to kind of highlight, I'm going to discuss a little bit about the accountability, and then the curriculum directors are going to speak to the

348
00:34:00,174 --> 00:34:02,255
test results in their respective departments.

349
00:34:03,295 --> 00:34:12,019
But I do want to highlight that there was a new pilot that Dr. Chiesa will speak about, which is the civics in eighth grade.

350
00:34:12,099 --> 00:34:15,241
So a lot of assessments in the eighth grade.

351
00:34:16,261 --> 00:34:31,527
But before each subject is discussed, for English language arts, for mathematics, and for science, technology, and engineering, we have a slide that just shows the overall narrative for the state of Massachusetts MCAS results.

352
00:34:33,408 --> 00:34:34,468
Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

353
00:34:34,508 --> 00:34:41,751
So for the results this evening, the directors are going to be discussing with you

354
00:34:42,369 --> 00:34:44,190
two areas of reports.

355
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:52,754
They are going to show you the achievement within their departments, and they are going to discuss student growth within their departments.

356
00:34:53,114 --> 00:35:01,919
They are also going to discuss what they're doing with this data and how this is informing the work of their departments and what the next steps are.

357
00:35:02,859 --> 00:35:14,794
I'm just going to briefly cover the other piece of the MCAS assessment system is the assigned accountability rate for individual schools as well as the district as a whole.

358
00:35:15,415 --> 00:35:21,742
So this chart shows you the criteria or the key features that all go into how

359
00:35:22,833 --> 00:35:28,341
the Department of Education calculates the accountability rating for schools and the district.

360
00:35:29,062 --> 00:35:32,627
So they look at the achievement in all of the content areas.

361
00:35:32,848 --> 00:35:35,612
They look at student growth in all of the content areas.

362
00:35:36,313 --> 00:35:38,196
They also look at high school completion.

363
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:46,983
Clearly, this is not a factor at the elementary level or the middle school level, but it is a factor in our overall accountability and at the high school.

364
00:35:47,844 --> 00:35:55,371
All schools are looked at for their English language proficiency rating, which also calculates the score that we get

365
00:35:56,231 --> 00:35:59,813
for EL students that take the ACCESS statewide testing.

366
00:36:00,853 --> 00:36:16,501
And then there are two additional indicators that the Department of Education looks at, which is chronic absenteeism, as well as the percentage of high school students that are engaged in advanced coursework and graduation rates.

367
00:36:18,066 --> 00:36:19,926
You may go to the next slide, Dr. Cushing.

368
00:36:20,487 --> 00:36:20,887
Thank you.

369
00:36:21,427 --> 00:36:26,748
This just shows a basic overview of the accountability ratings for the past three years.

370
00:36:27,628 --> 00:36:33,489
You will see on average that the accountability rates across the district show substantial progress.

371
00:36:34,129 --> 00:36:41,971
And we had some schools that really showed a great gain in accountability percentage from in the past three years.

372
00:36:42,891 --> 00:36:47,092
And you will also see that the majority of our schools do not require

373
00:36:47,654 --> 00:36:53,239
any sort of assistance or intervention from this Department of Education.

374
00:36:55,261 --> 00:37:00,606
Before I advance, are there any questions on the first two slides regarding accountability?

375
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:07,813
The accountability, oh, I guess I have to be called on.

376
00:37:08,558 --> 00:37:09,439
You're the member.

377
00:37:09,499 --> 00:37:09,779
I'm Phil.

378
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:14,844
Yeah, the accountability percentile is that within the district?

379
00:37:14,904 --> 00:37:15,165
I know.

380
00:37:15,345 --> 00:37:19,649
So I looked on the Desi site and it's it's compared to other schools.

381
00:37:19,789 --> 00:37:24,875
Is that within the district or other schools with similar similar population statewide?

382
00:37:25,976 --> 00:37:26,416
The latter.

383
00:37:26,436 --> 00:37:27,597
Okay.

384
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:30,881
Member Russo.

385
00:37:32,045 --> 00:37:34,687
Yes, thank you.

386
00:37:35,108 --> 00:37:38,971
Are you going to explain the requiring assistance or intervention later?

387
00:37:40,272 --> 00:37:41,573
No, I can cover that here.

388
00:37:43,815 --> 00:37:48,959
If you look, the Roberts has shown great gains in their accountability.

389
00:37:49,259 --> 00:37:52,542
They also showed some pretty great gains in their achievement overall.

390
00:37:54,304 --> 00:38:00,109
But as I indicated, one of the measures that the Department of Education

391
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:15,120
has in their calculation to determine their accountability rating is the participation rate across grade levels, across the school, and across subgroups.

392
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:19,464
And there was one subgroup where the participation dipped

393
00:38:22,699 --> 00:38:30,706
a little bit below what they want to see, and so they have this requiring assistance or intervention.

394
00:38:31,446 --> 00:38:48,380
I do think it's important, since you asked the question, I don't think it's important to maybe discuss the subgroup, but I do think it's important that the participation rate, if families opt out, it does

395
00:38:49,503 --> 00:38:53,545
factor into the overall accountability rate from the Department of Education.

396
00:38:53,565 --> 00:38:56,787
And so that does affect our scores.

397
00:38:57,748 --> 00:39:02,451
And that is what happened at the Roberts.

398
00:39:04,752 --> 00:39:05,172
Thank you.

399
00:39:05,212 --> 00:39:10,075
I just want to not clarify, because that's a question.

400
00:39:10,615 --> 00:39:11,456
I don't know the answer.

401
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:13,237
But the score itself,

402
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:23,626
I mean, Roberts has, for instance, a 41, which is higher than one, two, three, four other schools.

403
00:39:24,887 --> 00:39:34,133
So is it affecting the score or merely the determination of whether we need assistance or intervention?

404
00:39:34,673 --> 00:39:35,093
Correct.

405
00:39:35,934 --> 00:39:36,655
Okay, thank you.

406
00:39:37,035 --> 00:39:37,215
Yes.

407
00:39:42,981 --> 00:39:45,362
Okay, Dr. Cushing, do you mind advancing two slides?

408
00:39:53,203 --> 00:39:54,003
Thank you, so one more.

409
00:39:55,444 --> 00:39:55,764
Thank you.

410
00:39:56,564 --> 00:40:04,186
I am sure that this is common knowledge for some, but I do think it's just important to show the grades in which we're talking about this evening.

411
00:40:04,286 --> 00:40:07,887
So for third grade, there's an English language arts test and a math.

412
00:40:08,267 --> 00:40:09,427
That's the same for fourth grade.

413
00:40:10,316 --> 00:40:14,037
Same for fifth grade, except there's also a science test given.

414
00:40:14,118 --> 00:40:17,979
Grades six and seven, English Language Arts and Math.

415
00:40:18,359 --> 00:40:26,362
Grade eight, again, has science, as well as this year a field test for civics, which Dr. Chiesa will speak more about.

416
00:40:27,203 --> 00:40:31,044
Grade nine is the science requirement for graduation.

417
00:40:31,884 --> 00:40:37,767
And grade 10 has the English Language Arts and the math requirement for graduation.

418
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:47,147
And at this point, I am going to introduce Dr. Chiesa, who is going to speak to you about civics and then English language arts.

419
00:40:49,569 --> 00:40:50,510
Good evening, everybody.

420
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:56,096
I'm going to begin, as Dr. Galluzzi said, by outlining the civics MCAS.

421
00:40:57,381 --> 00:41:05,086
If we look at the timeline, we have known for a few years that the civics MCAS will be coming.

422
00:41:05,686 --> 00:41:09,288
And so essentially the timeline begins in 2019.

423
00:41:09,388 --> 00:41:11,969
There were some voluntary pilots along the way.

424
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:14,751
There was another voluntary pilot.

425
00:41:14,931 --> 00:41:21,975
And last year we had a statewide, what they refer to as a field test for all schools serving grade eight students.

426
00:41:23,934 --> 00:41:29,556
Next, this school year, we anticipate this to be an operational test.

427
00:41:29,696 --> 00:41:43,840
So I do anticipate next year coming to you with specific scores, specific accountability reviews, whereas this past year was the field test to determine what this current year will look like.

428
00:41:47,181 --> 00:41:52,203
To give you a little background, since we really haven't talked too much about this on the floor is,

429
00:41:53,439 --> 00:41:54,941
The actual assessment.

430
00:41:54,981 --> 00:41:57,604
So the assessment is comprised of two components.

431
00:41:58,124 --> 00:42:02,309
We have what the state is referring to as the state level performance task.

432
00:42:03,451 --> 00:42:07,876
And that is centered on one of the seven topics from the grade eight civic standards.

433
00:42:08,056 --> 00:42:10,679
So our grade eight civic standards have seven topics.

434
00:42:11,314 --> 00:42:18,943
and this in sum with many, many subtopics underneath, and the state level performance task will focus on one of those seven.

435
00:42:19,604 --> 00:42:27,533
But then in addition, excuse me, in addition to that, we have the end of course test, which covers the full breadth of the grade eight civic standards.

436
00:42:28,666 --> 00:42:36,348
This gives you, this chart on the right gives you a sense of what was looked at, how it was dispersed for this year.

437
00:42:36,948 --> 00:42:42,350
We have topics one and two, a certain percentage, three and six, four, five, and seven.

438
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:48,051
And so we can get a sense of what types of questions were asked when we look at this table.

439
00:42:50,852 --> 00:42:51,652
The next slide, please.

440
00:42:53,342 --> 00:43:05,985
Just putting a couple examples of some questions from not the actual test, obviously, but some questions that we could practice with, just to give you a sense.

441
00:43:06,385 --> 00:43:16,508
They look similar to, you know, a regular MCAS question on TestNav, but these are kind of give you a sense of what's being asked.

442
00:43:17,228 --> 00:43:18,068
The next slide, please.

443
00:43:21,161 --> 00:43:25,604
And so when we got our results back, again, it's a field test.

444
00:43:25,704 --> 00:43:30,347
They're trying to determine what's going to work for questions, what maybe didn't work.

445
00:43:30,707 --> 00:43:39,652
But the nice thing about the field test was it did give us some information on where our students scored well and where there are areas of growth.

446
00:43:39,872 --> 00:43:42,854
Overall, the district scored in line with the state.

447
00:43:44,335 --> 00:43:48,177
We did score above the state in a variety of topics.

448
00:43:50,285 --> 00:43:54,488
namely analyzing a source to explain how the U.S.

449
00:43:54,528 --> 00:43:58,431
government was influenced by the political structures of Native peoples.

450
00:43:59,052 --> 00:44:04,075
We did well on supporting, on figuring out which evidence supports a claim.

451
00:44:04,916 --> 00:44:13,543
And students showed strong depth at both middle schools with their understanding of the state and federal powers granted under the U.S.

452
00:44:13,623 --> 00:44:15,184
and Massachusetts constitutions.

453
00:44:15,976 --> 00:44:21,100
Of course, we did see some need for opportunities for growth in a few different topics.

454
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:25,223
T1, again, so Topic 1, we were strong on in one question.

455
00:44:26,124 --> 00:44:29,666
Topic 1, we struggled with the Enlightenment and the American Revolution.

456
00:44:29,726 --> 00:44:38,993
So that section of Topic 1, we would want to go back to as a civics team and look to see where we can support this even more.

457
00:44:40,034 --> 00:44:49,040
They struggled a bit with describing how an amendment to the US Constitution expanded access to civil rights and determining the branch of government in which a state government position belongs.

458
00:44:49,540 --> 00:45:01,367
Again, this is an abbreviated test, so it just gives us a little sense of where we can shift our curriculum to make sure our students are fully prepared for this exam.

459
00:45:02,822 --> 00:45:10,973
Our next steps are going to be to continue to remain updated on any changes that might occur as DESE continues to develop the exam structure.

460
00:45:11,514 --> 00:45:20,546
We will engage in an in-depth analysis of these standards, as well as other data points that we do have, and make adjustments on the pacing guide as necessary.

461
00:45:20,922 --> 00:45:25,624
This test does, unlike English, come towards the end of the school year.

462
00:45:26,085 --> 00:45:29,626
So there is ample time to review the different topics.

463
00:45:29,726 --> 00:45:37,970
But again, we do want to keep in mind that our eighth graders are tested on four different subject areas now.

464
00:45:38,090 --> 00:45:41,032
So we have to continue to work with test stamina.

465
00:45:41,778 --> 00:45:43,979
eighth grade graduations around the same time.

466
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:52,324
Obviously we've planned the calendar to avoid conflicts, but there is a lot going on in an eighth grade year, just like any other district.

467
00:45:52,444 --> 00:45:55,126
So we have to be cognizant of that as we move forward.

468
00:45:55,146 --> 00:45:57,407
I think there's a question.

469
00:45:58,648 --> 00:45:59,529
Yes, Mr. Russo.

470
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:02,310
Thank you.

471
00:46:02,811 --> 00:46:07,754
Does the test cover anything to do with local government at all?

472
00:46:08,905 --> 00:46:22,051
And I realize there's immense variability, but I mean, I know within every community, there's a vast misunderstanding of how local government works and what our responsibilities and powers are.

473
00:46:22,091 --> 00:46:24,993
And it seems like that would be a great opportunity.

474
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:35,887
Yeah, certainly, like within the civics standards themselves that is expanded on, especially when we look at like the Massachusetts Constitution and different pieces like that.

475
00:46:36,348 --> 00:46:45,494
We don't have access to the questions per se, but that it's basically going to cover anything in those civics topics, including local government.

476
00:46:46,175 --> 00:46:46,455
Excellent.

477
00:46:46,675 --> 00:46:47,055
Thank you.

478
00:46:47,416 --> 00:46:47,696
Thanks.

479
00:46:52,239 --> 00:46:54,701
Dr. Cushing, I think you could put the thank you

480
00:47:00,979 --> 00:47:05,164
Okay, so moving on to our English Language Arts MCAS results.

481
00:47:05,744 --> 00:47:10,169
This slide is discussing the state as a whole.

482
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:19,979
So this slide is not specific to Medford Public Schools, but what we did see across the entire state was a decrease in 2024 as compared to 2023.

483
00:47:22,972 --> 00:47:31,198
So as a state, the state of Massachusetts fell three percentage points when you look at the grades three through eight, and the high school fell one percentage point.

484
00:47:31,618 --> 00:47:33,719
Not a great story for the state as a whole.

485
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:40,084
And so we did wanna highlight that this was interesting.

486
00:47:40,424 --> 00:47:42,005
I don't think we've seen this for some time.

487
00:47:43,046 --> 00:47:46,028
So again, the state as a whole did have some dips.

488
00:47:47,947 --> 00:47:54,176
When we look at Medford on the next slide, we are going to see how Medford compared in relation to 2023.

489
00:47:54,236 --> 00:47:59,284
So we will see 2023 data for Medford versus 2023 data for the state and then looking at 2024 Medford versus 2024 for the state.

490
00:48:04,904 --> 00:48:12,667
Just at a cursory glance, if we take grade three, for example, in 2023, the state was, excuse me, Medford was three percentage points above the state.

491
00:48:13,207 --> 00:48:16,328
This year, Medford is four percentage points above the state.

492
00:48:16,548 --> 00:48:22,810
Different cohorts, different groups of students being tested on the same grade three curriculum skills.

493
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:25,991
So this just gives you that look over the years.

494
00:48:27,952 --> 00:48:31,934
Actually, if you go back for one moment, please, we will talk about this in a minute.

495
00:48:32,035 --> 00:48:46,342
Just the one thing I do want to highlight is our grade 10 took a dip in 2023, being six percentage points below the state, which is unlike and isn't really what our trends have been in the past.

496
00:48:47,183 --> 00:48:50,825
This year, we were creeping back to be within two percentage points of the state.

497
00:48:50,905 --> 00:48:55,907
So I did want to highlight that because I do think that's an important comparison there.

498
00:48:56,628 --> 00:48:57,068
Next slide.

499
00:48:58,988 --> 00:49:14,520
When we look at growth, we see that we have achieved what the state determines as typical growth for every grade level, as well as every school within the grade.

500
00:49:17,322 --> 00:49:25,068
We will see that in grade four, we have the district mean SGP is 50, grade five overall it's 51,

501
00:49:26,496 --> 00:49:34,041
Grade six, where we do see dips compared to the state, we still see typical growth.

502
00:49:35,802 --> 00:49:46,168
Similarly, grade seven, we have dips compared to the state, which I will talk about in a minute, but we also do see some strong growth there.

503
00:49:47,722 --> 00:49:53,329
eight grade eight is the same and the high school continues to be the highest school or the.

504
00:49:54,370 --> 00:50:01,899
there's one other school the brooks also, excuse me, the mcglennon grade for also grew at 57 but we do see a high number, along with grade eight mcglennon at 59.

505
00:50:02,439 --> 00:50:06,544
Next slide please.

506
00:50:11,030 --> 00:50:22,239
So if we see the gains and glows, what we're seeing in English is that the students in grades three through five performed well, with each grade exceeding the state average.

507
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:29,765
Students in every grade level and at every school, as I just noted, did achieve strong growth throughout the district.

508
00:50:31,226 --> 00:50:38,632
We have our 10th graders, our 8th graders, and our 4th graders at various schools achieving high growth percentiles, which is what I just pointed out to you.

509
00:50:40,052 --> 00:50:51,558
And out of the 56 subgroup data that was in the packet you received from grades four to 10, 52 out of those 56 subgroups achieve typical or high growth.

510
00:50:53,279 --> 00:50:57,501
We also have opportunities to continue to improve.

511
00:50:58,425 --> 00:51:06,291
So we see, and I believe there's a bar graph somewhere in here, but if not, we can refer back to the chart table.

512
00:51:06,691 --> 00:51:14,617
We do see that the students at the secondary level, while experiencing growth, did fall below the state performance levels.

513
00:51:14,798 --> 00:51:18,861
And that is something we need to look at closely and we are looking at as a team

514
00:51:20,161 --> 00:51:23,022
And we see that, you know, between the two schools.

515
00:51:23,722 --> 00:51:28,903
We have most significant declines relative to the state differential found in grades six and seven.

516
00:51:29,564 --> 00:51:35,585
And we do see that students at the middle school level exhibited some weaknesses specific to writing and grammar.

517
00:51:35,645 --> 00:51:42,107
So part of the work is digging deeper into where we dipped.

518
00:51:42,747 --> 00:51:47,428
And so as we begin to look, we see at the middle school level, the grammar and writing

519
00:51:48,061 --> 00:51:50,762
is probably where our biggest dips were.

520
00:51:52,563 --> 00:51:53,683
So what do we do with this?

521
00:51:53,823 --> 00:52:00,386
Well, we have several action steps that have begun and will continue to work on throughout the school year.

522
00:52:01,206 --> 00:52:10,090
We're going to continue to closely analyze all subgroup and domain analytics, particularly at the middle school, and we need to make some adjustments as we deem necessary.

523
00:52:10,950 --> 00:52:20,159
We do need to look as a district at the instructional time at the secondary level within the humanities classrooms and I know that that is work that is already being.

524
00:52:22,168 --> 00:52:24,009
that is already occurring within the district.

525
00:52:25,130 --> 00:52:34,395
I do want to see us taking strong advantage of our reading literacy skills teachers by maximizing instructional time and cohort compositions.

526
00:52:34,916 --> 00:52:36,597
We've done a lot of work with that.

527
00:52:36,697 --> 00:52:42,500
We've had the district support with that, and you have kindly reinstated those teachers a few years ago.

528
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:45,502
We need to continue to develop that model.

529
00:52:46,543 --> 00:52:51,950
At ELA secondary level, we want to start a curriculum review.

530
00:52:51,970 --> 00:52:54,493
It hasn't been done for quite some time.

531
00:52:54,573 --> 00:53:00,320
So we want to start looking at that since such wonderful and intense work has been done at the elementary level.

532
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,804
We want to make sure that carries through at the secondary.

533
00:53:04,642 --> 00:53:13,465
More globally, within the English and sometimes the social studies classroom, we want to implement close reading programs like Alexia Power Up.

534
00:53:13,525 --> 00:53:15,946
We have done some PD already on that.

535
00:53:16,326 --> 00:53:18,487
That's an extension of Alexia Core 5.

536
00:53:18,647 --> 00:53:29,451
So where students are struggling, our struggling students, our tier twos, will benefit from some reinforcement of close reading skills, and Alexia Power Up can provide that.

537
00:53:30,372 --> 00:53:33,873
We also need to explore a strong grammar program at the secondary level.

538
00:53:34,517 --> 00:53:38,340
We will continue to offer professional development for writing at the secondary level.

539
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:43,563
We did begin PD on our half day specific to writing.

540
00:53:43,603 --> 00:53:53,210
We had a presenter come in and work with us on a specific writing approach, and we will continue with that throughout the year.

541
00:53:54,171 --> 00:53:58,093
And again, we will continue to support the elementary's program implementation.

542
00:53:58,334 --> 00:54:03,097
Thank you to the school committee for all of their support with all of the different pieces of that.

543
00:54:03,598 --> 00:54:11,703
We will continue to support ECRI, our enhanced core reading instruction, as well as that shift to the science of reading.

544
00:54:15,466 --> 00:54:17,127
Are there any questions I can answer?

545
00:54:17,147 --> 00:54:22,651
Dr. Christian, do you mind going back one slide while questions are being, thank you.

546
00:54:25,032 --> 00:54:26,013
Thank you, Dr. Chiesa.

547
00:54:29,615 --> 00:54:30,276
No questions.

548
00:54:31,092 --> 00:54:32,493
I think I see a question.

549
00:54:32,553 --> 00:54:32,953
Thank you.

550
00:54:32,973 --> 00:54:33,914
Member Reinfeld.

551
00:54:34,454 --> 00:54:34,934
Thank you.

552
00:54:36,355 --> 00:54:39,997
So you've mentioned a couple of these key areas within ELA.

553
00:54:40,838 --> 00:54:51,464
Do these results, these gaps, do they match what teachers are kind of reporting outside of the standardized test evaluation?

554
00:54:51,484 --> 00:54:58,027
Because writing is definitely one of those things that you see a lot better in

555
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:03,981
everyday classroom experiences rather than the standardized test model?

556
00:55:05,662 --> 00:55:21,106
We see with grammar and vocab, we do see that within the classroom as the teachers have indicated that they see some of that deficit as well, and that's what the MCAS is showing us.

557
00:55:21,826 --> 00:55:27,468
The middle school, last year we were able to provide the middle school students with

558
00:55:28,061 --> 00:55:30,683
a sample of the question they had answered the year previous.

559
00:55:30,703 --> 00:55:32,385
We were able to obtain that.

560
00:55:32,965 --> 00:55:40,071
And what I think was the big surprise was that the stamina with the writing didn't seem to be there.

561
00:55:40,111 --> 00:55:46,416
So I think the teachers were surprised, and this is very global, to just see, this is what you wrote?

562
00:55:46,556 --> 00:55:48,698
And positive and negative.

563
00:55:48,718 --> 00:55:52,140
I don't mean that completely negative, or this is what you wrote, great job.

564
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:56,324
But we were able to analyze more deeply what their output was.

565
00:55:56,937 --> 00:56:08,767
Interestingly enough, even though writing is lower at the middle school, at the high school, in that domain, we were 10 percentage points above the state.

566
00:56:09,147 --> 00:56:13,451
So something is shifting between eight and 10, and that seems to historically be the case.

567
00:56:13,831 --> 00:56:20,777
Something is happening between eighth grade, from the time they take the MCATs in eighth grade to the time they take it in 10th grade.

568
00:56:22,057 --> 00:56:22,977
with that piece.

569
00:56:23,277 --> 00:56:25,478
So we need to figure that out a little bit more.

570
00:56:26,259 --> 00:56:34,782
And I don't know if I just answered your question, but yes, grammar and vocab is where we're seeing a deficit in the classroom, as well as on the test.

571
00:56:34,982 --> 00:56:49,507
I think with the writing, it's just more of the output, the final product that was... Because I know students approach homework very differently than they approach, or in class exercises very differently than they approach

572
00:56:50,231 --> 00:57:13,107
yeah test with writing we often do a lot with scaffolding graphic organizers generating ideas and it's a process to put the final product together um including editing and so we just need to dig a little deeper to see how we can translate that better in the classroom because we know the skills are there um but it's just not being as presented yeah i just want to

573
00:57:14,361 --> 00:57:21,507
understand how good an indicator this particular test is on these really important skills.

574
00:57:21,567 --> 00:57:21,887
Thank you.

575
00:57:21,907 --> 00:57:22,308
Thank you.

576
00:57:22,448 --> 00:57:22,808
Thank you.

577
00:57:34,018 --> 00:57:34,358
Thank you.

578
00:57:34,398 --> 00:57:36,500
We can continue the presentation or is that it?

579
00:57:37,621 --> 00:57:38,521
No, two more to go.

580
00:57:39,602 --> 00:57:40,143
That's what I thought.

581
00:57:40,183 --> 00:57:40,423
Thank you.

582
00:57:44,206 --> 00:57:45,949
Pfizer will present math.

583
00:57:46,843 --> 00:57:47,683
the math of results.

584
00:57:48,303 --> 00:57:48,844
Thank you.

585
00:57:48,944 --> 00:57:53,725
Thank you, Dr. Galluzzi, Dr. Vincent, and school committee members.

586
00:57:53,865 --> 00:57:54,505
Good evening.

587
00:57:56,186 --> 00:58:03,668
So as Dr. Chiesa mentioned, the first slide is, it's about the statewide math MCAS proficiency.

588
00:58:04,748 --> 00:58:15,891
When we are looking at the scores, we see that as compared to the 2023 results, the math MCAS for grades three through eight remained the same.

589
00:58:16,691 --> 00:58:22,856
And in grade 10, the state reported a decrease of about two percentage points.

590
00:58:23,796 --> 00:58:29,921
And as Dr. Keyes mentioned, and Dr. Galluzzi before that, this is the statewide picture.

591
00:58:30,341 --> 00:58:35,024
So if we move on to the next slide, here we see the Medford numbers.

592
00:58:36,866 --> 00:58:40,508
I am seeing, I saw,

593
00:58:41,869 --> 00:58:44,534
slight improvement in certain grades.

594
00:58:44,814 --> 00:58:47,599
I saw that grade three, grade six and grade eight.

595
00:58:48,915 --> 00:58:57,461
improved and grade 10 stayed at pretty much the same level as the state.

596
00:58:58,702 --> 00:59:04,946
And when we move on to actually 20, I'm sorry, 23 and 24.

597
00:59:05,247 --> 00:59:07,809
If you go one slide back, Dr. Cushing, I apologize.

598
00:59:07,849 --> 00:59:08,209
Thank you.

599
00:59:08,589 --> 00:59:13,093
Grade 10 stayed at the same level as 2023 actually.

600
00:59:13,453 --> 00:59:16,795
And now we can move to the next slide.

601
00:59:16,875 --> 00:59:17,336
Thank you.

602
00:59:18,112 --> 00:59:24,541
So here is the SGP for mathematics.

603
00:59:26,003 --> 00:59:32,613
I was happy to see that three schools at Brooks, fourth grade,

604
00:59:34,495 --> 00:59:43,201
Andrews at the 6th grade level and McGlynn Middle School at the 8th grade level reported SGP of higher than 60.

605
00:59:43,521 --> 00:59:46,403
Typical growth is between 40 and 60.

606
00:59:46,584 --> 01:00:00,053
I am looking at one of the schools with SGP that is lower than what I was expecting to see or we were expecting to see as a team.

607
01:00:01,154 --> 01:00:05,217
But we do have a plan in mind for that particular case.

608
01:00:05,277 --> 01:00:14,604
So if we can move on to the next one, making a note that on average, all Medford schools and all grades fell between 40 and 60.

609
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:20,784
Here is the summary for mathematics in general.

610
01:00:20,844 --> 01:00:30,413
So the main gains and the goals are, as I mentioned, three of the grades that different schools showed higher than typical growth, that is greater than 60.

611
01:00:30,733 --> 01:00:37,300
The district's grade 10 SGP matched the state's grade 10 SGP, which is 49.

612
01:00:39,562 --> 01:00:49,610
And last year in 2023 when I looked at the different clusters and the domains and I did the and we looked at the item analysis sheet.

613
01:00:50,571 --> 01:00:54,634
There were huge differential sometimes in certain clusters, there was a negative 17.

614
01:00:55,695 --> 01:00:59,898
We have significantly reduced that to single digits this year.

615
01:01:00,779 --> 01:01:15,829
And for the third one, district's grade six standards and domain possible points matched very closely with the state's possible points and grade six SGP showed overall

616
01:01:16,829 --> 01:01:18,430
and 11 point growth.

617
01:01:18,950 --> 01:01:26,093
So these were the things that we are happy to report.

618
01:01:26,853 --> 01:01:29,695
What are the opportunities for growth in mathematics?

619
01:01:31,772 --> 01:01:34,195
The first thing is our grade seven.

620
01:01:35,676 --> 01:01:40,802
When we are looking at the grade seven overall scores, they are lower.

621
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:45,307
And when we are looking at digging deeper, we are looking at the different domains.

622
01:01:46,208 --> 01:01:50,633
Geometry is the one that basically where our students

623
01:01:51,614 --> 01:01:54,377
didn't do as well as we were hoping.

624
01:01:55,098 --> 01:02:03,728
And the reason for that is that the students in grade seven, when they took this test, this MCAS in 23-24, in

625
01:02:06,992 --> 01:02:22,668
22, 23 they were in sixth grade and in 21 and 22 they were in fifth grade and when they were in fifth grade geometry was covered as the very last unit and that was under our older program envisions.

626
01:02:23,729 --> 01:02:27,713
Ever since we have adopted investigations three geometry is now

627
01:02:29,775 --> 01:02:42,180
in the middle, and it's constantly spiraling, and hopefully we will not see these scores for much too long, if at all.

628
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:53,184
The second area of growth that we notice is, of course, that grade four, especially in one particular elementary school,

629
01:02:54,344 --> 01:02:58,628
needs, that's where we need to provide educator support and guidance.

630
01:02:59,488 --> 01:03:11,539
And the third one is that the equations and expressions domain in 7th, 8th, and 10th grade is based off on the arithmetic operations in elementary standards and domains.

631
01:03:11,579 --> 01:03:16,363
So in elementary school, in elementary mathematics, we have

632
01:03:17,003 --> 01:03:24,286
three different domains where our students on and off didn't do as well as we were hoping.

633
01:03:24,966 --> 01:03:33,189
And those are the number and operations in base 10, number and operations in fractions, and operations and algebraic thinking.

634
01:03:33,229 --> 01:03:36,710
So operations is very common in all three domains.

635
01:03:37,250 --> 01:03:40,192
and then it showed up in our 7th, 8th, and 10th grade.

636
01:03:41,253 --> 01:03:49,118
Also, the new elementary program is very strong on this particular domain because it's very explorations-based.

637
01:03:49,679 --> 01:03:58,525
So when they talk about operations, they are not teaching them through worksheet or through the videos, but actually teaching it to the students through explorations.

638
01:03:59,085 --> 01:04:03,968
So again, I'm hoping for better results next year.

639
01:04:04,489 --> 01:04:05,469
So next.

640
01:04:05,709 --> 01:04:06,090
Thank you.

641
01:04:07,185 --> 01:04:09,026
So here are our action steps.

642
01:04:10,227 --> 01:04:17,533
We have constantly been reviewing our pacing guides and looking at the available resources at the elementary level.

643
01:04:18,133 --> 01:04:27,140
All elementary teachers have been provided with a pacing guide, and I have met with every single grade level team.

644
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:33,582
through their CPT and I will continue doing that.

645
01:04:34,042 --> 01:04:50,548
I plan also to work specifically with the new fourth grade team at the elementary school where it can benefit from such thing and such meetings where they can ask any questions and I'm happy to be

646
01:04:52,309 --> 01:04:53,411
there for them.

647
01:04:53,491 --> 01:05:05,926
So I'm planning to have another touchpoint meeting with them in December, so that if any questions arise in the middle of the year, I can answer them, I can take a look as to if any

648
01:05:07,047 --> 01:05:11,410
other resources that I can provide other than the ones that I have already provided.

649
01:05:12,671 --> 01:05:20,156
The second one is that we are looking at the work that needs to be done, especially in the lowest scoring domains and standards.

650
01:05:20,636 --> 01:05:31,844
So of course, we'll be looking at our fifth grade pieces and because that's where fraction and operations meet together.

651
01:05:31,944 --> 01:05:35,066
So fourth grade is our big grade on fractions.

652
01:05:35,746 --> 01:05:47,076
And I feel that if we have shaky foundations, then when we try to do the fifth grade operations on fractions, our students face a tougher time.

653
01:05:47,156 --> 01:05:50,779
So we want to start this work at the fifth grade level.

654
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:59,327
We also want to continue discussions with the teachers during department meetings to understand the challenges with particular domains, especially at the middle school.

655
01:06:01,969 --> 01:06:10,035
And also at the high school, but definitely at the middle school, because that's where we get our fifth grade students is at the sixth, seventh and eighth grade level.

656
01:06:11,376 --> 01:06:21,423
We want to learn more about the available resources and we want to make sure, you know, we provide as much support to the students as well, not just the educators.

657
01:06:21,923 --> 01:06:26,506
That can be done through the Saturday Academy and through the extended day teaching.

658
01:06:28,047 --> 01:06:34,449
We also want to, we have been offering fourth and eighth grade ST Math intervention and extension platforms.

659
01:06:35,609 --> 01:06:49,693
Teachers have been provided resources in terms of illustrative mathematics tasks to provide extensions for the students who can use them.

660
01:06:50,633 --> 01:07:01,361
We have also been reviewing map data with the teachers on the particular domains specifically to identify which students and where the support is needed.

661
01:07:02,602 --> 01:07:05,403
Within the classrooms, teachers can provide that support.

662
01:07:06,644 --> 01:07:17,552
And then we want to plan professional development to extend the knowledge of our veteran elementary teachers and train the new teachers on the pedagogy of the investigations program.

663
01:07:18,933 --> 01:07:30,121
I came to the school committee two years ago and we ran the pilot one year and then we adopted investigations.

664
01:07:31,782 --> 01:07:46,073
But we have hired a big pool of elementary teachers and we want to be sure that they are on board with this pedagogy of, you know, of more of explorations and more of, and less of,

665
01:07:47,694 --> 01:07:50,656
worksheet based student learning.

666
01:07:51,857 --> 01:07:54,739
And we definitely want to work on the subgroup data.

667
01:07:55,580 --> 01:07:58,542
And we are looking at the instructional vision.

668
01:07:59,583 --> 01:08:04,507
And we want to make sure that we give our students high quality instruction.

669
01:08:05,087 --> 01:08:09,270
But again, it has to be with proper scaffolding.

670
01:08:10,371 --> 01:08:14,054
And we want to make sure that all our grade levels

671
01:08:15,014 --> 01:08:19,995
continue to get the deeply engaging instructional instructions.

672
01:08:20,395 --> 01:08:23,436
And that's the curriculum we have been investing in.

673
01:08:23,876 --> 01:08:35,198
The one that prioritizes and emphasizes on hands-on approach and on student engagement pedagogy.

674
01:08:35,698 --> 01:08:39,339
So thank you and happy to answer any questions.

675
01:08:40,399 --> 01:08:40,779
Thank you.

676
01:08:48,444 --> 01:08:49,085
Member Reinfeld?

677
01:08:49,826 --> 01:08:50,887
No, you're shocked, it was me.

678
01:08:52,429 --> 01:08:57,555
Should we be expecting to see some similar wiggles with the new integrated math that's coming up?

679
01:08:58,216 --> 01:09:02,602
You answered my question about, is this because we switched curricula at the elementary level?

680
01:09:02,702 --> 01:09:07,308
Should we be expecting this middle and high school as well in a couple of years?

681
01:09:08,101 --> 01:09:10,963
I am hoping so, Member Reinfeldt.

682
01:09:11,604 --> 01:09:32,521
In my conversations with the teachers, they do believe that integrated math too is more rigorous, but it also brings a spiral perspective and that it doesn't leave much room for students to only be algebra-oriented or only be geometry-oriented in any particular year.

683
01:09:32,861 --> 01:09:34,502
So I'm hoping to see those,

684
01:09:35,923 --> 01:09:36,904
that progress.

685
01:09:37,004 --> 01:09:41,766
And I know that this year we don't have geometry, we only have algebra too.

686
01:09:42,206 --> 01:09:55,333
So only within next couple of years, we'll know better, but in conversations with the teachers and with their unit tests, they are reporting stronger results with integrated curriculum.

687
01:09:56,194 --> 01:10:01,156
So we don't think things are gonna dip back, dip down the way they did in some of these areas here?

688
01:10:01,176 --> 01:10:04,578
Or is that just, we can't predict that yet?

689
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:06,801
It's difficult to predict.

690
01:10:07,101 --> 01:10:13,986
I mean, I haven't spoken with a single teacher who is not hopeful about integrated math.

691
01:10:14,146 --> 01:10:14,987
Let's put it this way.

692
01:10:15,027 --> 01:10:16,708
Everybody is liking it so far.

693
01:10:16,788 --> 01:10:20,231
Nobody has said, we want to go back to algebra, geometry, algebra.

694
01:10:21,031 --> 01:10:23,492
they feel it's the right way to go.

695
01:10:23,892 --> 01:10:34,557
And so, I mean, as I said, the classroom assignments and classroom assessments are indicating that we will have stronger results.

696
01:10:35,258 --> 01:10:42,581
So I'm hoping that, and our MAP scores have been pretty good when it comes to growth.

697
01:10:42,841 --> 01:10:48,204
So- The MAP scores and the MCAS scores are matching up in terms of which areas are strong

698
01:10:49,164 --> 01:10:49,704
That's right.

699
01:10:49,925 --> 01:10:50,385
That's right.

700
01:10:50,505 --> 01:11:01,152
In fact, the MAP assessment showed some great growth in mathematics, all starting from, you know, grade one, all the way to grade 10.

701
01:11:01,613 --> 01:11:03,414
And I was very pleased to see that.

702
01:11:03,514 --> 01:11:04,535
So I'm hoping that

703
01:11:05,235 --> 01:11:09,338
it'll translate into our MCAS assessments as well.

704
01:11:09,358 --> 01:11:20,544
And that's what we can do, but we will continue to collaborate during department meetings and compare and contrast and see where we can actually improve.

705
01:11:20,604 --> 01:11:29,750
And if there are, you know, like for example, our Saturday Academy teachers collaborated with all of the integrated one and integrated two colleagues to see

706
01:11:30,433 --> 01:11:34,159
Where are they seeing the gaps during math assessments?

707
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:38,346
And that's how they catered their Saturday Academy teaching too.

708
01:11:38,847 --> 01:11:43,776
So I feel like we are moving in the right direction and I'm hoping to see good results.

709
01:11:44,366 --> 01:11:44,546
Okay.

710
01:11:44,646 --> 01:11:55,254
And then as we look, as we think about staffing for future budget cycles, I know when we targeted certain literacy skills, we prioritized literacy specialists.

711
01:11:55,934 --> 01:12:00,997
And I know there was a period in MPS history when there were some math specialists in the schools.

712
01:12:01,057 --> 01:12:03,599
Is that something that we're looking at?

713
01:12:03,619 --> 01:12:07,002
What you described sounds like the structures around

714
01:12:07,955 --> 01:12:11,601
team planning and scheduling with the trainings.

715
01:12:12,182 --> 01:12:15,187
We're covering it with the existing staff and the teachers.

716
01:12:16,449 --> 01:12:19,394
But is this something we should be thinking about as we look ahead?

717
01:12:20,575 --> 01:12:31,419
I think, I do believe that having math coaches or math interventionists will be beneficial.

718
01:12:32,759 --> 01:12:39,022
And I mean, if that's something that's a possibility, I would love to advocate for it, yes.

719
01:12:39,522 --> 01:12:42,063
Remember Reinfeldt, that's her dream.

720
01:12:45,290 --> 01:12:51,673
I'm trying to be conservative with my thoughts here, but yes, Dr. Galussi knows it.

721
01:12:51,733 --> 01:12:57,275
I think I'm going there on a weekly basis, or if not, at least a monthly base.

722
01:12:57,675 --> 01:13:04,478
So yes, I would love to get math coaches at least reinstated if our budget allows that.

723
01:13:04,778 --> 01:13:09,139
I think it's very beneficial for the teachers to be able to go to someone

724
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:18,804
I am readily available, but somebody who can mentor them and somebody who can demonstrate and model lessons for them.

725
01:13:20,185 --> 01:13:22,786
But we are not desperately suffering without them.

726
01:13:23,587 --> 01:13:27,509
And these scores seem to support that we are making the progress.

727
01:13:28,409 --> 01:13:29,770
Yes, yes.

728
01:13:31,591 --> 01:13:34,492
All the things we could do with bigger budgets.

729
01:13:35,153 --> 01:13:36,053
All right, thank you.

730
01:13:36,694 --> 01:13:37,534
Of course, thank you.

731
01:13:45,473 --> 01:13:53,240
One more section, and Director Cieri will discuss the science results district-wide.

732
01:13:55,963 --> 01:13:57,224
Good evening, everyone.

733
01:13:57,244 --> 01:13:58,165
I hope you can hear me.

734
01:14:01,224 --> 01:14:21,059
As the other two presentations began with the statewide data, we can see that in science, the statewide data showed that at grades 5 and 10, there were increases by three percentage points at grade 5 and two percentage points at the high school in grade 9, 10.

735
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:23,701
However, they decreased in grade 8.

736
01:14:24,081 --> 01:14:25,883
So this is, again, statewide data.

737
01:14:25,903 --> 01:14:29,406
And we'll look a little more deeply at our

738
01:14:30,939 --> 01:14:33,082
our own data in a moment.

739
01:14:33,863 --> 01:14:46,558
One thing I do want to highlight is the fact that Medford participated in the pilot, the state selected which communities would participate, I believe there were

740
01:14:48,826 --> 01:14:56,688
If I recall correctly, it was about 10,000 students that participated in the science pilot and it was at grade five and grade eight.

741
01:14:57,308 --> 01:15:01,809
The pilot exam included a two day typical exam.

742
01:15:01,869 --> 01:15:07,050
However, day one, it included the traditional next gen exam questions.

743
01:15:07,610 --> 01:15:11,451
And on day two, the students were exposed to the pilot questions.

744
01:15:11,491 --> 01:15:16,712
These are called performance tasks or innovative questions is how they're termed.

745
01:15:17,773 --> 01:15:24,101
On the next slide, if we move ahead, you can see a sampling of the two versions of the questions.

746
01:15:24,242 --> 01:15:31,151
On the left, you can see the more traditional next-gen MCAS questions, where you can select in a box.

747
01:15:31,211 --> 01:15:32,153
They give you a reading.

748
01:15:33,214 --> 01:15:33,695
You can see

749
01:15:35,686 --> 01:15:47,084
a food web there, there's a cycle, a decomposition, and then you're allowed to choose your response in an open block.

750
01:15:48,348 --> 01:16:08,543
The performance task or the innovative question, the one in color in the lower right, that entire blocked off area, includes a space where there are a couple of, you can see three tabs where the students have to click each tab to see

751
01:16:09,324 --> 01:16:20,394
different locations, and then they have this simulation tab where they perform simulations, experiments, digital experiments, and collect data.

752
01:16:21,034 --> 01:16:28,361
And once they perform that experiment, they're asked a series of questions that go along with that question.

753
01:16:28,421 --> 01:16:28,681
So the

754
01:16:30,106 --> 01:16:42,457
The two question types are quite different, but I did want to highlight that, that the exam that the students took last year in grades five and grade eight have these two different types of question formats.

755
01:16:43,538 --> 01:16:48,001
One on the first day, the next gen MCAS, and one on the second.

756
01:16:49,122 --> 01:16:50,884
We can click on to the next slide.

757
01:16:52,967 --> 01:17:02,513
Keeping that in mind, I just carried through the three-year data for the state and for Medford.

758
01:17:04,354 --> 01:17:15,601
And you can see that at grade five, the students are, they're about four percentage points below the state for this year.

759
01:17:15,701 --> 01:17:15,761
So,

760
01:17:19,648 --> 01:17:32,172
I would also keep in mind that the current test questions were half the number of questions that could be used to compare the groups to get the student scores.

761
01:17:32,732 --> 01:17:34,572
And then the same at grade eight.

762
01:17:34,672 --> 01:17:43,235
At grade eight, you can see that we are eight points below the state and the state also performed a little worse this past year.

763
01:17:45,020 --> 01:17:54,403
At grade nine, the majority of students that take the grade nine, 10 high school competency test is in one subject in biology.

764
01:17:55,163 --> 01:18:01,585
And right now we were two percentage points above the state for this year's test.

765
01:18:02,605 --> 01:18:06,286
In the past, we've been slightly below or almost even with them.

766
01:18:08,067 --> 01:18:09,327
We can click the next slide.

767
01:18:11,162 --> 01:18:15,906
So in science, I believe that the students performed well at the high school level.

768
01:18:16,886 --> 01:18:29,235
We're using a storyline curriculum that spirals the content consistently throughout the year, so that things that generally you would think of as beginning of the school year topics

769
01:18:30,215 --> 01:18:32,496
recur in subsequent units.

770
01:18:33,576 --> 01:18:35,737
And we've been doing that for the past two years.

771
01:18:36,337 --> 01:18:51,041
It is a really engaging curriculum, but it also allows students to keep all of the standards and the types of content that's expected on an MCAS exam to always remain fresh, the standards that are used.

772
01:18:52,201 --> 01:18:57,206
In grade five, we noticed that students have broad knowledge base in all the domains.

773
01:18:58,167 --> 01:19:05,513
There wasn't any one pocket of content or subject area that demonstrated a weakness.

774
01:19:06,094 --> 01:19:06,935
So that's good.

775
01:19:06,995 --> 01:19:15,482
It tells us that the FOSS curriculum is certainly covering all the domains of science in a sufficient way.

776
01:19:16,568 --> 01:19:25,656
And at the Missittuck in particular, I think the grades warrant attention, not for negative, but for positive.

777
01:19:25,716 --> 01:19:30,360
They have had gains, I believe 19 percentage points over the last three years.

778
01:19:31,361 --> 01:19:35,664
And so that's really something pretty remarkable to see.

779
01:19:36,565 --> 01:19:39,788
These are different cohorts of students and yet the progress continues.

780
01:19:40,368 --> 01:19:44,312
And so that's a really nice story to tell.

781
01:19:46,677 --> 01:19:56,620
And areas for growth for science are in particular in grade eight did show as a cohort some weaknesses in testing as you saw on the previous slide.

782
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:01,001
These are the current grade nine students at Medford High School.

783
01:20:01,621 --> 01:20:03,882
So we'll need to make sure that there are supports.

784
01:20:05,042 --> 01:20:18,327
in place to make sure that the students make progress in biology so that their outcomes on the MCAS are strong and give them a shot at making sure that they reach their competency determination this year.

785
01:20:18,747 --> 01:20:24,929
So that's something that we're looking at in the immediate term through department meetings, conversations.

786
01:20:27,230 --> 01:20:31,352
When I speak with the teachers that are running the ninth grade class and then

787
01:20:32,152 --> 01:20:46,880
Potentially, as we look forward to some of the additional class opportunities that are possible with extended time, we would try to leverage it for helping those students out.

788
01:20:49,594 --> 01:21:00,142
Some of the challenges that scheduling present at elementary schools points to a greater focus on making sure that our instructional time for science is maximized.

789
01:21:01,183 --> 01:21:06,968
We definitely have worked with FOSS a lot, and I believe that it's a strong program.

790
01:21:07,428 --> 01:21:15,154
What we have not done is we've been very broad with the scope to identify the sort of the,

791
01:21:16,315 --> 01:21:31,825
the units of instruction in a particular part of the year, but we haven't very well narrowed down to key lessons that must be covered at particular time points in a sequential fashion.

792
01:21:31,905 --> 01:21:44,753
So I think a lot of our work should probably center around that in the next year, year to year and a half, so that we can sort of make it much more predictable for the teachers.

793
01:21:45,393 --> 01:21:47,935
and supportive of improvement.

794
01:21:49,335 --> 01:22:14,311
And also we'll look at potential program changes at middle school because at this point we're looking at stagnant growth, I believe, and so one of the areas that I think could use a refresh at this point, at least we're going to look at what we have and potentially what is available at middle school so that we can begin to

795
01:22:15,305 --> 01:22:17,967
ponder some changes there for curriculum.

796
01:22:18,468 --> 01:22:27,655
So those are the, where we see some strengths and then some areas for growth for us in science based on MCAS tests.

797
01:22:29,597 --> 01:22:31,359
Can we move on to the next slide?

798
01:22:31,619 --> 01:22:31,879
Okay.

799
01:22:32,199 --> 01:22:33,941
I think, no, actually Dr. Cushing.

800
01:22:34,261 --> 01:22:34,661
Questions.

801
01:22:35,382 --> 01:22:35,602
Yeah.

802
01:22:35,642 --> 01:22:35,962
Sorry.

803
01:22:36,683 --> 01:22:37,944
Go back one slide in case.

804
01:22:37,984 --> 01:22:38,845
One slide, sorry.

805
01:22:38,865 --> 01:22:39,606
There you go, perfect.

806
01:22:40,767 --> 01:22:43,589
And if anyone has any questions, I'll be happy to take them.

807
01:22:45,566 --> 01:22:47,107
I did see member Rousseau's hand.

808
01:22:47,127 --> 01:22:49,347
I don't know if his question was already answered.

809
01:22:52,448 --> 01:22:52,789
It was.

810
01:22:54,769 --> 01:22:55,129
Thank you.

811
01:22:56,190 --> 01:22:57,470
Thank you to all the presenters.

812
01:23:04,093 --> 01:23:10,435
There's one more section if that's okay, but I can cover it very briefly if there's no science questions.

813
01:23:11,673 --> 01:23:12,453
No science questions.

814
01:23:12,614 --> 01:23:13,614
Go to it.

815
01:23:13,794 --> 01:23:14,475
Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

816
01:23:15,155 --> 01:23:16,216
I just think it's important.

817
01:23:16,436 --> 01:23:19,958
I'll go very quickly, but the next slide, please, Dr. Cushing.

818
01:23:19,978 --> 01:23:31,565
I think it's very important to just highlight some subgroup data and just some overall trends in some of the things that we have found and that you may have heard in the presentations from the curriculum directors.

819
01:23:32,365 --> 01:23:39,489
So our subgroup data, I think it's just important to note that the Department of Education reports around 11 subgroups.

820
01:23:39,789 --> 01:23:40,770
They are listed here.

821
01:23:41,328 --> 01:23:52,253
and that there needs to be at least 20 students within that subgroup for us to have results reported in terms of tracking subgroup growth and achievement rates.

822
01:23:53,013 --> 01:23:57,795
Overall, we saw improvement in nearly all of the subgroups.

823
01:23:57,875 --> 01:24:02,117
There are some dependent on the grade and dependent on the content.

824
01:24:02,897 --> 01:24:09,340
There are some areas in which we're digging a little bit deeper into, not just specifically with

825
01:24:09,844 --> 01:24:23,489
the content and the curriculum directors, but also with our data analyst, Kim Miles, in how we're reporting and how we're categorizing some of the subgroup data.

826
01:24:24,890 --> 01:24:36,814
At this time, through the registration process, some of the subgroup data is self-reported, and so we're also just really looking into how that

827
01:24:37,310 --> 01:24:39,412
factors into some of our subgroup data.

828
01:24:40,072 --> 01:24:54,065
But all in all, in grades three through eight, subgroups remained statistically about the same, or they met, in some cases achieved, or exceeded achievement targets, and they showed a range of low to high typical growth.

829
01:24:54,825 --> 01:25:03,067
And high school students actually met or exceeded achievement targets in nearly all subgroups with high growth gains overall.

830
01:25:04,088 --> 01:25:11,750
And so we do acknowledge that I think the overall, as you heard in most of the presentations, is that our story is growth.

831
01:25:12,910 --> 01:25:20,752
Medford Public Schools showed a lot of growth in all areas, but we do have some work to do when we're looking at achievement and closing some of those gaps.

832
01:25:21,272 --> 01:25:22,713
And so we recognize that.

833
01:25:22,853 --> 01:25:40,988
We're very happy to see that our students are learning because the growth is there, but we are doing the work to continue to disaggregate the data and look at the instructional decisions and moves that need to be made to ensure that interventions and instructional approaches are put in place.

834
01:25:42,730 --> 01:25:43,891
Next slide, please.

835
01:25:45,444 --> 01:25:57,886
And so I think it's also very important to kind of highlight some of the work globally that we also have been doing around the professional development, especially for some of the subgroup data.

836
01:25:59,126 --> 01:26:12,609
That continued focus on instructional priorities and culturally responsive practices really factor in as well to ensuring the growth and achievement of our students.

837
01:26:15,572 --> 01:26:25,615
I also want to target, and if you don't mind, I'm gonna have you advance to the next slide while I talk through some of those interventions that we've put in place.

838
01:26:25,655 --> 01:26:29,416
We saw tremendous growth around.

839
01:26:29,496 --> 01:26:43,980
So last year, in an effort to meet student needs instructionally and as well as the high-stakes MCAS standard for graduation, the high school had a Saturday Academy as Principal Cabral

840
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:49,323
mentioned, there were two parts of that Saturday Academy.

841
01:26:49,543 --> 01:27:01,011
One focused on regaining for MCAS and one was on just course credit.

842
01:27:01,831 --> 01:27:12,558
And so for the MCAS in particular, four out of the 18, I think it's important to note that four out of the 18 students that participated in the ELA program

843
01:27:13,288 --> 01:27:18,416
partially or fully met the expectations in terms of the MCAS.

844
01:27:18,436 --> 01:27:23,965
So we saw that direct correlation to the work they did throughout the school year and how they did on MCAS.

845
01:27:24,546 --> 01:27:25,647
And so overall,

846
01:27:27,352 --> 01:27:35,217
The students that attended that Saturday program increased 17 points from their grade eight MCAS ELA to their grade 10.

847
01:27:36,157 --> 01:27:42,881
Respectfully for the math, we saw 18 out of 21 students partially or meet expectations.

848
01:27:43,622 --> 01:27:49,005
And overall, they increased from two points from eighth grade to their 10th grade.

849
01:27:49,686 --> 01:27:56,650
And Mr. Seery already spoke about the science piece, but there was a program for afterschool support.

850
01:27:57,250 --> 01:28:05,857
in which 16 students were offered and 12 of the 16 passed the biology test the second time around.

851
01:28:06,697 --> 01:28:22,069
And so a lot of this work we want to see not only continue, as it will at the high school level, but also how we're going to implement program and targeted assistance like this at our middle school level and elementary.

852
01:28:22,129 --> 01:28:24,091
But we're definitely looking to

853
01:28:24,932 --> 01:28:29,436
It won't be Saturday, but it will be an extended day program at the middle school level.

854
01:28:29,816 --> 01:28:45,751
And so we're going to begin, the curriculum directors and the principals and I are going to begin creating that so that our students at the middle school level have the additional opportunity to work on

855
01:28:48,174 --> 01:28:49,715
closing some of that achievement.

856
01:28:50,615 --> 01:29:01,279
I also want to say that also targeted to this that you may have heard, especially at the elementary and the middle school, is that overall piece around time and schedule.

857
01:29:01,939 --> 01:29:09,282
And so one of the things that we are looking at is that we do, there's limited time

858
01:29:10,675 --> 01:29:16,079
right now reflected in the elementary schedule, as well as the middle school schedule.

859
01:29:16,399 --> 01:29:39,934
And I think we are also taking a little bit of a deeper look at how we can work within the constraints of the existing schedule, but also what are the opportunities that we can, Dr. Cushing, you can take the slide presentation down, how we can work within the constraints of the schedule, but also maybe how can we look

860
01:29:40,575 --> 01:29:49,217
and vet the current existing schedules to allow our students a little bit more instructional time at both the elementary and the middle school levels.

861
01:29:50,757 --> 01:29:55,178
I'm happy to answer any broad, overarching questions.

862
01:29:59,860 --> 01:30:05,221
Dr. Galluzzi, just remind us what funding was used for the Saturday tutoring.

863
01:30:05,241 --> 01:30:06,861
Yeah.

864
01:30:10,598 --> 01:30:12,820
a collaboration of funding sources.

865
01:30:13,380 --> 01:30:32,212
And so some of it came out of the Title II, Every Student Succeeds Act, federal funding that we have, as well as some of the funding that is given through the city's operating budget and allotted to the high school principal.

866
01:30:33,453 --> 01:30:33,673
Thank you.

867
01:30:39,113 --> 01:30:40,534
Member Reinfeld has her hand up.

868
01:30:41,555 --> 01:30:42,295
Oh, I missed that.

869
01:30:42,335 --> 01:30:42,896
Hold on a second.

870
01:30:44,897 --> 01:30:45,417
Thank you.

871
01:30:45,918 --> 01:30:46,498
Member Reinfeld.

872
01:30:47,098 --> 01:30:47,459
Thank you.

873
01:30:48,319 --> 01:30:54,163
So I remember you saying a few meetings ago that the reason people didn't pass was because they didn't show up.

874
01:30:54,243 --> 01:30:58,246
It was mostly an attendance issue rather than an instruction issue.

875
01:30:58,286 --> 01:31:05,370
And on the Saturday and after school, those four, and I forget if it was four or three and the other ones.

876
01:31:05,931 --> 01:31:06,091
Yes.

877
01:31:07,688 --> 01:31:15,690
If additional remediation services are needed, is that interfering with people's ability to take elective classes?

878
01:31:16,170 --> 01:31:20,972
You alluded to the high school schedule and the constraints within the schedule.

879
01:31:23,572 --> 01:31:25,513
How does this affect people's ability to take?

880
01:31:27,393 --> 01:31:28,134
It doesn't.

881
01:31:28,414 --> 01:31:36,676
I've seen that in other districts where the students who need MCAS support get pulled out of some of the other classes

882
01:31:38,277 --> 01:31:43,278
are really essential to wanting to be in school.

883
01:31:44,499 --> 01:31:58,383
So currently, Principal Cabral created the Saturday Academy because we don't have a block of time within the high school schedule to provide interventions or to what you're speaking of.

884
01:31:59,122 --> 01:32:05,545
So the Saturday Academy kind of did become based on that.

885
01:32:06,045 --> 01:32:14,849
But the constraints that I was speaking about a little bit right now were not the high school level, it's the three through eight levels.

886
01:32:15,149 --> 01:32:15,789
Exactly.

887
01:32:16,129 --> 01:32:26,414
I mean, because I know we have this challenge in elementary school of, like, my kid misses art in order to do strings, but sometimes she misses recess and science.

888
01:32:28,075 --> 01:32:34,957
I didn't ask Dr. Seary, like we need more targeted science, but do we also need more time for science as well?

889
01:32:35,237 --> 01:32:40,418
So trying to understand what's fighting with what to guess.

890
01:32:41,538 --> 01:32:41,999
The education.

891
01:32:42,039 --> 01:32:51,361
I would not want to hear about the science part being interrupted by strings, but I do know that other specialist classes in a morning meeting

892
01:32:52,097 --> 01:33:03,223
absolutely students sometimes have to choose between the enrichment activity of strings or band and another specialist class or morning meeting.

893
01:33:03,383 --> 01:33:12,207
It should not be at the expense of content, but even if all the stars align, it is very

894
01:33:14,657 --> 01:33:21,761
Science and social studies definitely wind up taking somewhat of a backseat to literacy and math.

895
01:33:22,121 --> 01:33:34,508
And when you think of elementary schools as being the foundation, even Faiza spoke about those skills that are needed at the fourth and fifth grade level to build off what's coming in middle school.

896
01:33:35,309 --> 01:33:36,690
That's the same for all content.

897
01:33:36,730 --> 01:33:39,011
That's the same for reading skills.

898
01:33:39,051 --> 01:33:40,572
That's the same for science skills.

899
01:33:40,632 --> 01:33:44,154
And so it does somewhat become a vicious cycle.

900
01:33:45,379 --> 01:33:49,503
And then it leads into middle school where the academic blocks are very small.

901
01:33:52,445 --> 01:34:07,078
And so we're going to start to look at what does that maybe look like where the daily academic block is tight to fit in all the instructional priorities that are probably needed in a daily lesson.

902
01:34:08,599 --> 01:34:10,981
Thank you for laying that out.

903
01:34:28,039 --> 01:34:30,660
We have, thank you for the presentation, everybody.

904
01:34:30,680 --> 01:34:31,720
Thank you.

905
01:34:32,340 --> 01:34:33,801
Next up, we have continued business.

906
01:34:35,181 --> 01:34:43,343
Because there's no presentations of the public, we have policy ACGB, title nine, sexual discrimination grievance procedure.

907
01:34:43,363 --> 01:34:48,924
The Department of Public Schools is committed to maintaining school environments free of sexual discrimination.

908
01:34:49,665 --> 01:34:51,265
Sexual discrimination in any form

909
01:34:51,829 --> 01:34:53,170
or for any reason is prohibited.

910
01:34:53,190 --> 01:35:01,052
This includes sexual discrimination by administrators, personnel, students, vendors, and other individuals in school or at school-related events.

911
01:35:01,553 --> 01:35:02,213
Member Graham.

912
01:35:02,973 --> 01:35:04,274
Motion to waive the reading.

913
01:35:05,214 --> 01:35:05,654
Second.

914
01:35:06,194 --> 01:35:08,875
Motion to waive the reading by Member Graham, seconded by Member Reinfeld.

915
01:35:08,915 --> 01:35:09,696
Roll call, please.

916
01:35:13,377 --> 01:35:14,057
Member Bradley.

917
01:35:14,838 --> 01:35:15,078
Yes.

918
01:35:15,878 --> 01:35:16,438
Member Graham.

919
01:35:16,858 --> 01:35:17,098
Yes.

920
01:35:18,079 --> 01:35:18,679
Member Ntuk.

921
01:35:19,219 --> 01:35:19,479
Yes.

922
01:35:20,260 --> 01:35:20,880
Member Olopade.

923
01:35:21,451 --> 01:35:21,751
Yes.

924
01:35:22,511 --> 01:35:23,092
Member Rheinfeld?

925
01:35:23,532 --> 01:35:23,992
Yes.

926
01:35:24,632 --> 01:35:25,453
Member Russo, yes.

927
01:35:25,513 --> 01:35:26,333
Mayor Longo Kern?

928
01:35:26,933 --> 01:35:27,253
Yes.

929
01:35:27,533 --> 01:35:29,114
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

930
01:35:29,254 --> 01:35:32,475
The motion is passed to waive the reading.

931
01:35:41,779 --> 01:35:44,300
I'll make a motion to approve the policy.

932
01:35:44,740 --> 01:35:46,541
If anybody else wants to speak on it.

933
01:35:48,042 --> 01:35:48,602
I'll second it.

934
01:35:52,014 --> 01:35:55,555
by member Russo, seconded by member Bramley.

935
01:36:01,257 --> 01:36:04,958
Member Bramley.

936
01:36:06,038 --> 01:36:06,258
Yes.

937
01:36:07,339 --> 01:36:07,839
Member Graham.

938
01:36:08,379 --> 01:36:08,619
Yes.

939
01:36:09,459 --> 01:36:10,139
Member Ntapa.

940
01:36:10,500 --> 01:36:10,720
Yes.

941
01:36:11,620 --> 01:36:12,320
Member Olopade.

942
01:36:16,341 --> 01:36:16,641
Yes.

943
01:36:18,142 --> 01:36:18,802
Member Reinfeldt.

944
01:36:22,005 --> 01:36:23,166
Member Rousseau, yes.

945
01:36:23,587 --> 01:36:24,368
Mayor Longo, current.

946
01:36:25,008 --> 01:36:28,472
Yes, so in the affirmative, zero negative, the policy has been approved.

947
01:36:29,113 --> 01:36:29,313
Page 21.

948
01:36:39,153 --> 01:36:50,341
offered by member Graham 2024-39, be it resolved that the administration will present a report on the state and condition of the bathrooms in Medford High School.

949
01:36:50,881 --> 01:36:59,327
Be it further resolved that report will include recommendations to improve conditions in the bathrooms and increase the number of available bathrooms during all parts of the school day.

950
01:36:59,867 --> 01:37:05,131
Be it also resolved that the report will be delivered to the school committee at our December 2nd, 2024 meeting.

951
01:37:05,151 --> 01:37:06,492
Is there a motion on the floor?

952
01:37:07,904 --> 01:37:12,267
Mayor, can I just add some context?

953
01:37:13,467 --> 01:37:18,871
A parent reached out to me about this somewhat recently.

954
01:37:18,891 --> 01:37:27,196
And I thought there might even be some students on who wanted to speak this evening, but I'm not seeing them.

955
01:37:28,577 --> 01:37:35,161
But my goal here is to say that the situation with the bathrooms at Medford High

956
01:37:35,801 --> 01:37:47,825
Is untenable, like, we have students who don't go to the bathroom all day long who don't drink anything during the school day and it's because they have to, like, wander the halls to find an open bathroom.

957
01:37:47,865 --> 01:37:49,465
My own daughter says the same thing.

958
01:37:49,485 --> 01:37:58,808
And I get that there is, like, a need for us to have some balance between.

959
01:37:59,924 --> 01:38:05,767
everything open all the time and some way to properly supervise these spaces.

960
01:38:06,467 --> 01:38:10,149
But what we're doing right now is not it.

961
01:38:10,669 --> 01:38:13,290
We haven't arrived at a balance.

962
01:38:13,391 --> 01:38:18,193
We have arrived at students having to wander the halls to figure out where the bathroom is.

963
01:38:18,273 --> 01:38:25,516
And every time we talk about this, I really hope it's the last time we ever talk about it, because I don't want to talk about the bathrooms.

964
01:38:27,838 --> 01:38:30,701
It just like we never seem to actually make any progress.

965
01:38:30,761 --> 01:38:41,472
So I am asking the administration to bring forward a proposal of like, tell us what you need in order to improve this situation.

966
01:38:42,193 --> 01:38:46,978
And what will an improved situation look like under some new plan?

967
01:38:47,058 --> 01:38:47,199
So.

968
01:38:48,288 --> 01:38:53,011
I am asking the administration to come back with a report.

969
01:38:54,732 --> 01:39:05,759
But I would hope that they will start with saying, what are the problems as all of our constituents in this picture see the problems?

970
01:39:05,899 --> 01:39:08,861
And how are we going to fix all of those problems?

971
01:39:11,656 --> 01:39:14,479
There are real constraints from a staffing perspective.

972
01:39:14,819 --> 01:39:15,760
Do we need more staff?

973
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:19,743
If we need more staff, what kind of staff do we need and how much will that cost us?

974
01:39:20,224 --> 01:39:26,809
Now is the time for us to be having these conversations because a budget season is coming quickly.

975
01:39:26,829 --> 01:39:35,257
But we may also have an infusion of funding to be talking about very, very shortly here, which I'm hopeful for.

976
01:39:37,446 --> 01:39:49,510
But I want to hear from the administration, what is the totality of the problems that sort of get in the way of everybody feeling bad about the bathroom situation?

977
01:39:49,830 --> 01:39:52,391
And what could make it better?

978
01:39:52,711 --> 01:39:55,932
What could we do to make the situation better?

979
01:39:57,513 --> 01:39:58,834
And what would that take?

980
01:39:59,074 --> 01:40:11,123
So I'm really asking for somebody to step back from where they are today and figure out, how do we move past this conversation?

981
01:40:11,163 --> 01:40:18,949
Because every time we talk about it, we talk about it as if we have done something different that's going to move us past the conversation.

982
01:40:18,969 --> 01:40:21,231
And that's just simply not happened.

983
01:40:23,112 --> 01:40:26,835
My daughter was telling me just the other day, she's like, oh, yeah, there's no schedule.

984
01:40:26,855 --> 01:40:28,916
Everyone says there's a schedule, but there's no schedule.

985
01:40:28,976 --> 01:40:31,838
And so you just wander the halls until you find a bathroom that you need.

986
01:40:32,279 --> 01:40:35,981
And they're gross, and there are lots of kids inside vaping.

987
01:40:36,582 --> 01:40:39,404
And so for all the supervision, we're still having all of those problems.

988
01:40:39,604 --> 01:40:42,026
Something has to change in this conversation.

989
01:40:42,046 --> 01:40:46,809
It's a real climate and culture issue, in my opinion, for the high school students.

990
01:40:47,850 --> 01:40:50,812
They don't want to go to a school where

991
01:40:51,994 --> 01:40:54,416
don't want to use the bathrooms because they're gross.

992
01:40:54,596 --> 01:40:55,497
I don't know.

993
01:40:55,517 --> 01:40:57,818
It's all got to change somehow.

994
01:40:57,838 --> 01:41:02,041
And I don't know what the changes are.

995
01:41:02,061 --> 01:41:04,303
I don't know what those things might be.

996
01:41:04,403 --> 01:41:18,393
But I am asking for us to actually dig in and come up with something that is a solution rather than just sort of shrugging and continuing to do the same things we've always done that don't work.

997
01:41:19,028 --> 01:41:22,090
So that's the genesis of this resolution.

998
01:41:23,071 --> 01:41:23,792
Thank you, member Graham.

999
01:41:23,872 --> 01:41:29,136
And before I turn it over to member Brandley, if I just could ask for a friendly amendment.

1000
01:41:29,276 --> 01:41:38,524
I know in 2019, the city council approved 250,000 for improvements to the bathrooms and I'm not sure any of that money, how it was spent or if it was spent at all.

1001
01:41:38,584 --> 01:41:42,727
I thought it was gonna be complete reno of multiple bathrooms and I'm not sure that was done.

1002
01:41:42,787 --> 01:41:45,109
So maybe we could add that to the report for December 2nd.

1003
01:41:45,649 --> 01:41:46,310
Member Brandley.

1004
01:41:48,078 --> 01:41:52,359
Hi, so I agree that the bathroom situation is not ideal.

1005
01:41:53,380 --> 01:41:58,882
I don't believe that it is as horrible as it is portrayed by some.

1006
01:42:00,002 --> 01:42:03,703
This is the schedule that was taken off of, hold on, where am I?

1007
01:42:04,683 --> 01:42:06,184
Off the door today.

1008
01:42:06,924 --> 01:42:07,784
This is the schedule.

1009
01:42:09,125 --> 01:42:12,906
And if the staff that are actually on the ground at the high school could,

1010
01:42:14,144 --> 01:42:17,609
Correct me if I'm wrong, but this is on the doors at the high school on the bathrooms.

1011
01:42:18,130 --> 01:42:21,114
So you have availability of all of these bathrooms all day long.

1012
01:42:22,315 --> 01:42:23,277
Is it great?

1013
01:42:23,477 --> 01:42:24,298
No, it's not great.

1014
01:42:24,839 --> 01:42:26,782
We also have, I think, too many bathrooms.

1015
01:42:27,934 --> 01:42:30,835
And I think in a new high school, we wouldn't have as many bathrooms also.

1016
01:42:30,975 --> 01:42:32,476
I know that that's not the situation now.

1017
01:42:33,937 --> 01:42:42,400
I reached out to nursing staff at Medford High, security at Medford High, custodians at Medford High, teachers at the high school and at the Volk.

1018
01:42:42,860 --> 01:42:45,341
And I also reached out to staff over at Somerville High School.

1019
01:42:46,822 --> 01:42:48,302
And these are the things that I heard.

1020
01:42:48,822 --> 01:42:55,045
More bathrooms equal more hangout spots, not supervised at all times because there's just not enough people.

1021
01:42:56,141 --> 01:42:59,744
Bathrooms that are open aren't enough, but who's going to man them?

1022
01:43:00,064 --> 01:43:01,225
We're already spread thin.

1023
01:43:02,206 --> 01:43:08,752
All bathrooms during lunch are locked, besides the calf bathrooms, but it's only a 30-second walk, I was told.

1024
01:43:09,713 --> 01:43:11,434
Bathroom schedule is always posted.

1025
01:43:11,454 --> 01:43:18,060
B and A buildings probably have the biggest inconvenience during lunchtime, not any other time.

1026
01:43:18,925 --> 01:43:22,166
Bathrooms are in better shape overall this year.

1027
01:43:22,726 --> 01:43:29,787
Kids do clog the toilets, can't have them open all the time, everywhere, because there's just not enough staff to secure them.

1028
01:43:30,307 --> 01:43:31,868
Graffiti this year has been minimal.

1029
01:43:32,888 --> 01:43:38,569
Vape detectors were pulled down, the majority of them, within the first couple of days.

1030
01:43:38,809 --> 01:43:40,029
I don't know if they've been fixed.

1031
01:43:41,269 --> 01:43:44,050
Main office for students, the bathroom is always available.

1032
01:43:45,685 --> 01:43:54,032
general gender neutral bathrooms, third floor C building, always open, open all day based on this schedule and based on what I was told.

1033
01:43:55,593 --> 01:43:58,396
Third floor and lunch ones need monitoring.

1034
01:43:59,016 --> 01:44:00,637
Everybody's doing the best that they can.

1035
01:44:00,718 --> 01:44:03,360
And these are quotes from staff that are there every single day.

1036
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:06,062
Nurse bathroom is for emergencies.

1037
01:44:06,222 --> 01:44:12,907
It is available, but obviously students with 504 plans and medical plans access, they are the priority.

1038
01:44:18,905 --> 01:44:21,387
Four sets of bathrooms open, ABC, Vogue.

1039
01:44:21,767 --> 01:44:23,449
That was a suggestion by someone.

1040
01:44:24,389 --> 01:44:26,691
Four full-time monitors, sign kids in.

1041
01:44:28,493 --> 01:44:30,114
That's not realistic, really.

1042
01:44:30,654 --> 01:44:31,015
Ideal?

1043
01:44:31,315 --> 01:44:31,595
Yes.

1044
01:44:31,735 --> 01:44:32,976
In an ideal world, that's great.

1045
01:44:33,577 --> 01:44:35,478
But that's probably not realistic.

1046
01:44:35,498 --> 01:44:40,082
The current situation does need improvement, but opening every bathroom would never work.

1047
01:44:41,235 --> 01:44:50,180
So I just wanted to give my feedback of everybody that I spoke to, like I said, nursing staff, security staff, custodians, teachers at both the high school and the voc.

1048
01:44:50,581 --> 01:45:01,347
And I spoke to some of the high school today, here we are, a high school right that went through what we hope to go through an old high school that had too many spots to a new high school that has

1049
01:45:02,205 --> 01:45:03,666
little bit more tailored to the needs.

1050
01:45:04,487 --> 01:45:08,029
Um, and there's a lot of single stall bathrooms at the new Somerville high school.

1051
01:45:08,650 --> 01:45:10,931
Um, there's still monitors in those bathrooms.

1052
01:45:11,752 --> 01:45:19,998
Um, so yes, things need to get better, but in asking students, even that I know, I'm like, do you know what bathroom to go to?

1053
01:45:20,018 --> 01:45:21,118
They're like, Oh yeah, it's posted.

1054
01:45:21,579 --> 01:45:21,919
Okay.

1055
01:45:22,860 --> 01:45:25,762
And could even name them to me off the top of their head.

1056
01:45:25,822 --> 01:45:26,122
So, um,

1057
01:45:28,539 --> 01:45:29,399
Do we need to do better?

1058
01:45:29,499 --> 01:45:42,843
Yes, I would never say that we're at 100%, but I definitely think that for safety concerns, top of the priority, the bathrooms that are open are what we can manage.

1059
01:45:43,383 --> 01:45:44,864
And still, it's not 100%.

1060
01:45:45,444 --> 01:45:51,486
So if we have six sets of bathrooms open, or three sets of bathrooms open, or 12 sets of bathrooms open,

1061
01:45:53,055 --> 01:45:58,724
does it really allow that many more students to use the toilet or does it allow that many more students to hang out?

1062
01:46:00,267 --> 01:46:01,428
This is my concern also.

1063
01:46:02,009 --> 01:46:03,412
So that's my two cents.

1064
01:46:04,353 --> 01:46:05,375
I look forward to the report.

1065
01:46:06,112 --> 01:46:10,854
I'm happy to know that there is some money, hopefully somewhere that we can help do some renovations.

1066
01:46:11,274 --> 01:46:23,078
I know that there was some renovations done to bathrooms and that the conditions in the bathrooms themselves are a little better, but it is not lost on me that I'm going to my reunion this year of 30 years in those of the bathrooms that used.

1067
01:46:23,914 --> 01:46:24,975
So that's not lost on me.

1068
01:46:25,175 --> 01:46:26,736
It's gross.

1069
01:46:27,077 --> 01:46:33,062
But some of that is going to have to be what we look forward to for a new Meffitt High, what we're envisioning.

1070
01:46:33,602 --> 01:46:37,485
So what we're doing now, I think we're doing the best of our ability.

1071
01:46:37,505 --> 01:46:41,729
And I just want to thank everybody who takes the time during the day to check those bathrooms.

1072
01:46:42,731 --> 01:47:00,197
to send kids back to their classrooms, the custodians who are cleaning up the bathrooms, the security monitors who are sending kids back to class, the nursing staff who is trying to accommodate everybody on 504 plans, and anybody else that needs the bathroom.

1073
01:47:00,237 --> 01:47:03,798
So a big shout out to everybody that's doing the work on the ground there.

1074
01:47:04,518 --> 01:47:04,919
So thanks.

1075
01:47:05,959 --> 01:47:06,899
Do you remember Bramley?

1076
01:47:07,259 --> 01:47:11,301
Okay, I think that's it.

1077
01:47:11,341 --> 01:47:12,161
Is there a motion on the floor?

1078
01:47:15,253 --> 01:47:15,934
Motion to approve.

1079
01:47:15,954 --> 01:47:19,557
I remember so seconded by member Graham.

1080
01:47:19,577 --> 01:47:23,040
Although roll call vote, please.

1081
01:47:23,801 --> 01:47:24,361
Ever Bramley.

1082
01:47:25,202 --> 01:47:25,462
Yes.

1083
01:47:25,482 --> 01:47:27,304
I'm a gram.

1084
01:47:27,865 --> 01:47:28,065
Yes.

1085
01:47:29,026 --> 01:47:29,746
Remember in topic?

1086
01:47:30,067 --> 01:47:30,367
Yes.

1087
01:47:31,088 --> 01:47:31,808
Remember all the party?

1088
01:47:32,369 --> 01:47:32,629
Yes.

1089
01:47:33,410 --> 01:47:34,130
Remember right now?

1090
01:47:34,571 --> 01:47:34,791
Yes.

1091
01:47:35,572 --> 01:47:36,352
Members say yes.

1092
01:47:36,393 --> 01:47:37,233
Maryland occurrence.

1093
01:47:38,274 --> 01:47:38,555
Yes.

1094
01:47:38,635 --> 01:47:40,937
Seven in the affirmative zero in the negative motion passes.

1095
01:47:42,128 --> 01:47:45,310
to be a resource to the school department, including but not

1096
01:48:12,293 --> 01:48:15,756
Attendance at parent meetings during challenging transitions.

1097
01:48:16,596 --> 01:48:18,738
An example is a principal changeovers.

1098
01:48:19,519 --> 01:48:21,360
Interview panel and question design.

1099
01:48:21,660 --> 01:48:22,981
Professional development days.

1100
01:48:23,802 --> 01:48:27,705
Consultation with external trainers for program design, presentation and support.

1101
01:48:28,245 --> 01:48:31,288
And or direct training by DEI director, ADA coordinator.

1102
01:48:32,188 --> 01:48:36,572
Assist with professional employment discipline cases involving civil rights allegations.

1103
01:48:37,312 --> 01:48:39,254
Civil rights complaints and mediation.

1104
01:48:39,818 --> 01:49:05,873
example, employee-to-employee, parent-to-NPS, in consultation to the administrative team on all civil rights-related matters, support required, training, and need after successful conversations with respective collective bargaining unit presidents, support HR as needed, consultation regarding ADA, FMLA crossover, review and guidance of external correspondence when addressing hate-related

1105
01:49:06,773 --> 01:49:22,637
Imaging found on school property and resource sharing, new laws, amendments to laws, case settlements from EEOC, and navigational support with HR, recruitment and talent acquisition, sharing of viable candidates from city side, and training support webinars, formal sessions, et cetera.

1106
01:49:22,777 --> 01:49:26,578
Other related items as identified by the administrative team.

1107
01:49:29,218 --> 01:49:30,639
Thank you for allowing me to read that.

1108
01:49:33,058 --> 01:49:44,920
I just to further point out, I meet with our city DEI director quite frequently and over the last, especially several months, if not close to a year,

1109
01:49:46,018 --> 01:49:54,022
the conversation is about obviously city departments, but it's a lot about the school department and all the support she's providing to the school, Frances Wajai.

1110
01:49:54,842 --> 01:50:05,967
And I put this resolution together to highlight that for the committee, because especially the last, like I said, several months, it's more and more about the support that our DEI director is giving to the schools.

1111
01:50:06,008 --> 01:50:15,332
And I felt that the school committee should not only be aware, but vote for this to continue and obviously compensate accordingly.

1112
01:50:16,462 --> 01:50:26,186
So I'd ask for support of the motion and so that the continued relationship and collaboration and work that Ms.

1113
01:50:26,206 --> 01:50:36,091
Wojcicki is doing for our schools, as well as of course our city continues, as I'm very happy that she's able to support our superintendent, HR and other departments.

1114
01:50:37,632 --> 01:50:38,852
So I'd ask for your support.

1115
01:50:43,594 --> 01:50:44,375
Member Reinfeldt.

1116
01:50:45,649 --> 01:50:50,651
Yeah, so I'm looking at this list and I'm incredibly grateful that we are getting that kind of support.

1117
01:50:51,232 --> 01:51:01,796
I'm also a little concerned if we need all the support, putting that on someone in the city who already has quite a full time job, I could see this all being a part of that.

1118
01:51:02,797 --> 01:51:12,081
So I think coordination is great, but it feels like maybe we need some more of the support built into the school structures.

1119
01:51:15,682 --> 01:51:18,329
I'll yield the floor to Member Olopade.

1120
01:51:19,612 --> 01:51:20,515
Thank you, Member Reinfeldt.

1121
01:51:20,535 --> 01:51:21,116
Member Olopade?

1122
01:51:22,557 --> 01:51:22,937
Thank you.

1123
01:51:23,217 --> 01:51:25,298
And I would happen to agree with Member Reinfeldt.

1124
01:51:25,358 --> 01:51:35,059
I think that though I'm incredibly excited and happy to hear that Director Wangie has been able to support the schools thus far and will continue to do so, I think in her role.

1125
01:51:35,439 --> 01:51:40,860
I do think that this sounds like a potential expansion from her role currently with the city.

1126
01:51:41,641 --> 01:51:49,402
And it might be possible that we can consider how to build that into the current structure of the school system and not rely on her so heavily.

1127
01:51:49,922 --> 01:51:52,845
I understand that her role is incredibly important already with the city side.

1128
01:51:52,885 --> 01:51:59,690
So is it possible that we can have some of these things built into the school charter, for example?

1129
01:51:59,750 --> 01:52:09,417
So, you know, thank you to her, and I want to be able to communicate with her a little bit more about what she's been doing, kind of her perspective on this as well, I think would be productive.

1130
01:52:09,618 --> 01:52:14,501
So I'll let member Graham as well say a few words if she has any.

1131
01:52:20,772 --> 01:52:31,959
I guess some of these things that are frankly, I'm really happy that Francis has supported us because we've just simply not been staffed to be able to do some of these things ourselves.

1132
01:52:33,580 --> 01:52:44,626
But we have made some investments in the HR team in particular, and I think we should be looking at what is the right thing for

1133
01:52:46,625 --> 01:52:55,250
For the district for a district of our size to have 800 employees, having this capability is, I think, important for the district.

1134
01:52:56,430 --> 01:53:00,633
I think the lines get very blurry when things go over to the city.

1135
01:53:01,573 --> 01:53:02,594
So, for example, if.

1136
01:53:03,414 --> 01:53:10,616
something comes to Francis's desk and then it requires some sort of appeal, does it go to the mayor or does it go to the superintendent?

1137
01:53:10,676 --> 01:53:14,757
Because the mayor doesn't have the authority over the schools that the superintendent does.

1138
01:53:16,417 --> 01:53:27,000
And I just think when I look at this list, there are certain pieces of this list that I frankly would expect the administration to be able to handle without needing Francis's support.

1139
01:53:27,580 --> 01:53:29,021
And I think there's other stuff that

1140
01:53:30,781 --> 01:53:45,769
The team probably needs training on to do well, but I don't think the answer is personally continuing to to sort of rely on whatever you know sort of slice of Francis's time she can provide so.

1141
01:53:47,029 --> 01:54:06,078
I'm not super in favor of this and it's not because I'm not grateful, but I think actually the thing I would want Francis to do is train our own staff so that we have this capability within our schools in a way that allows the people who spend the most time in the schools to be able to do this work that's relative and specific to the school.

1142
01:54:08,391 --> 01:54:10,892
I have some real reservations about this.

1143
01:54:11,032 --> 01:54:27,702
I also feel like we sort of are heading down a slippery slope of shared services, which was not the intention, at least for me, when we decided to accept that statute and share some resource on the facility side.

1144
01:54:27,722 --> 01:54:33,545
And you did mention some sort of stipend, but this doesn't

1145
01:54:34,677 --> 01:54:36,780
say what that is or who pays for that.

1146
01:54:36,901 --> 01:54:38,884
So I have a lot of questions.

1147
01:54:38,904 --> 01:54:46,135
I'm not particularly in favor of this as written, but I will defer to my colleagues who might have other thoughts.

1148
01:54:48,258 --> 01:54:48,879
Member Brantley.

1149
01:54:50,458 --> 01:54:55,984
Yeah, so just to piggyback with member Graham just said, I think that I did hear you say compensation at one point.

1150
01:54:56,085 --> 01:55:02,212
So I'm just curious how that would work between, you know, our school budget and the city budget.

1151
01:55:02,712 --> 01:55:07,238
I have to give three shouts out to Frances because I think she's one of the most loveliest human beings ever.

1152
01:55:09,637 --> 01:55:11,580
I can't help but hug her every time I see her.

1153
01:55:11,620 --> 01:55:13,182
She makes me really, really happy.

1154
01:55:13,202 --> 01:55:18,848
I love her energy, her messaging, the way she brings our community together.

1155
01:55:18,868 --> 01:55:21,652
I think she is a star.

1156
01:55:24,175 --> 01:55:26,758
But I do worry that we're going to blur that line.

1157
01:55:27,058 --> 01:55:28,420
And then if we blur the line,

1158
01:55:29,485 --> 01:55:30,506
you know, are we school?

1159
01:55:30,686 --> 01:55:31,766
Are we are we city?

1160
01:55:31,806 --> 01:55:33,027
It just makes me a little nervous.

1161
01:55:34,168 --> 01:55:35,109
I do love the sentiment.

1162
01:55:35,629 --> 01:55:40,212
Like member Graham said, I do think there are some things here that our staff definitely should be able to handle.

1163
01:55:42,073 --> 01:55:46,796
You know, I would love to clone Francis, just for my own personal life, to be honest.

1164
01:55:48,417 --> 01:55:53,840
But but yeah, I think I think we just have to really walk the line here.

1165
01:55:53,900 --> 01:55:54,741
So I just I think

1166
01:55:55,823 --> 01:55:58,405
that that just has to really be on the forefront.

1167
01:55:58,645 --> 01:55:59,346
So thanks.

1168
01:56:03,009 --> 01:56:03,469
Member Russo?

1169
01:56:05,199 --> 01:56:05,699
Thank you.

1170
01:56:05,899 --> 01:56:09,541
I also, just for having a love fest, I love Francis too.

1171
01:56:10,461 --> 01:56:23,927
I guess my one, one of my concerns, although the appeal question actually is one I had not thought of that member Graham brought up that jumps out at me as something quite important to understand and have a plan for.

1172
01:56:24,788 --> 01:56:29,230
But the other thing though is, you know, what I don't know is, is Francis

1173
01:56:30,635 --> 01:56:41,443
up-to-date on all of FERPA and all the educational privacy laws that are irrelevant to the city side.

1174
01:56:41,463 --> 01:56:52,091
And access to student information and personnel stuff too, but I think that this would sort of

1175
01:56:53,166 --> 01:56:57,607
put a bow on giving her access to personnel information.

1176
01:56:58,087 --> 01:57:01,589
I do wonder about access to student information.

1177
01:57:04,129 --> 01:57:13,872
And I don't know the legal stuff that allows, what the laws are that give, for instance, all of our staff access to student information.

1178
01:57:13,932 --> 01:57:16,573
But for instance, school committee members do not have access to that.

1179
01:57:16,993 --> 01:57:18,374
The mayor doesn't have access to that.

1180
01:57:20,632 --> 01:57:23,693
And nobody in City Hall has access to student information.

1181
01:57:23,913 --> 01:57:34,195
So how we would consider that aspect of student privacy I think has to be a part of the conversation.

1182
01:57:34,215 --> 01:57:41,916
And being on the other side of the wall of student information as a school committee member, the answer is you get none.

1183
01:57:43,456 --> 01:57:45,477
I'm very unaware of how

1184
01:57:46,457 --> 01:57:53,342
that is managed within the school system already to make sure that only the right people have access to student information.

1185
01:57:53,422 --> 01:57:55,784
So that is a concern I have as well.

1186
01:57:57,005 --> 01:57:58,866
So that's all I wanted to say.

1187
01:57:58,966 --> 01:57:59,327
Thank you.

1188
01:58:01,228 --> 01:58:01,929
Member Ntapa.

1189
01:58:03,470 --> 01:58:06,132
I mean, I also just wanted to share my love for Director Ntapa.

1190
01:58:07,093 --> 01:58:08,013
Francis is phenomenal.

1191
01:58:09,694 --> 01:58:13,257
But also, I guess it's a question for you, Mayor.

1192
01:58:13,357 --> 01:58:15,159
So we heard concerns about

1193
01:58:17,895 --> 01:58:21,556
This being a huge undertaking and using this to train our administration as well.

1194
01:58:21,636 --> 01:58:25,776
Wouldn't we have to vote yes on this anyways to give her.

1195
01:58:26,537 --> 01:58:31,698
To be able to allow her to train school members or in any way, like, would we have to allow.

1196
01:58:31,718 --> 01:58:39,619
Um, consolidation language for support regardless to enact that or to, um.

1197
01:58:40,879 --> 01:58:44,960
Give her some of those, those resources to train staff and to make that happen.

1198
01:58:46,658 --> 01:58:56,567
If she's willing to add to this list, I'm sure she is willing, and I know she's lent her expertise and is trying to help, especially HR, as much as she can.

1199
01:58:57,648 --> 01:59:05,015
But if she completely ceases doing this work, other than the ADA work, there's going to be a huge, huge gap.

1200
01:59:05,916 --> 01:59:06,976
in our school department.

1201
01:59:07,016 --> 01:59:12,377
I don't know if the superintendent or any of the administration wants to speak on this.

1202
01:59:13,638 --> 01:59:16,378
One suggestion is if anybody wants to add anything, that's fine.

1203
01:59:16,418 --> 01:59:19,639
If you want to make it temporary or review it within six months.

1204
01:59:21,980 --> 01:59:29,941
But there's support that Frances has given on a daily basis that, frankly, the schools need.

1205
01:59:30,081 --> 01:59:32,142
She has decades of experience and I don't think we

1206
01:59:33,086 --> 01:59:35,228
I don't think the city's ever had that.

1207
01:59:35,988 --> 01:59:45,316
I'm not sure if the school has ever had somebody with 30 years experience like this, who's moving the district along and helping however she can.

1208
01:59:46,457 --> 01:59:48,439
I have no doubt.

1209
01:59:48,559 --> 01:59:50,541
That wasn't, I'm sorry, that wasn't the point of my question.

1210
01:59:50,581 --> 02:00:00,549
That was just a hypothetical, just like a question of if that route were to be explored, where it was just a support and like a training factor, if we needed to take that vote anyways.

1211
02:00:02,092 --> 02:00:06,053
That was just my question, but no, I completely understand and I can only imagine.

1212
02:00:06,773 --> 02:00:12,394
But it sounds like Superintendent Edward Vincent has some pointers or Member Olopade.

1213
02:00:12,434 --> 02:00:12,834
I'm not sure.

1214
02:00:12,854 --> 02:00:13,374
I'm not sure.

1215
02:00:15,295 --> 02:00:16,335
But I yield my time.

1216
02:00:16,975 --> 02:00:17,195
Thanks.

1217
02:00:17,855 --> 02:00:20,956
Let Dr. Edward Vincent speak and then Member Olopade.

1218
02:00:22,696 --> 02:00:26,977
Point of personal privilege, I just want to say more that I support

1219
02:00:28,461 --> 02:00:32,544
1,000% this resolution that has gone forward.

1220
02:00:33,865 --> 02:00:43,171
The amount of work and support that Director Nwaje extends to the school department is clearly articulated in these bullets and beyond.

1221
02:00:44,092 --> 02:00:53,798
And I understand there's a lot of discussion back and forth, but the capacity right now does not exist in the Medford Public Schools.

1222
02:00:54,639 --> 02:00:57,381
And it would truly be a significant gap

1223
02:00:58,522 --> 02:01:09,631
And in order to be able to properly address ADA concerns and DEI concerns that exist within the Medford Public Schools, you do need someone with experience.

1224
02:01:10,352 --> 02:01:15,076
And so I, as a point of personal privilege, am saying that I support this resolution.

1225
02:01:15,616 --> 02:01:25,685
I understand the committee takes their own vote, but I am living in the Medford Public Schools in real time, and the support is needed, seriously needed.

1226
02:01:27,298 --> 02:01:27,658
Thank you.

1227
02:01:28,079 --> 02:01:29,801
Thank you, Dr Edward Vincent member of the party.

1228
02:01:31,282 --> 02:01:31,663
Thank you.

1229
02:01:32,384 --> 02:01:39,512
Um, so taking all all the members and points of privilege and consideration, I think it may be beneficial to kind of have another conversation about this.

1230
02:01:39,532 --> 02:01:40,873
Speak to the director as well.

1231
02:01:41,374 --> 02:01:48,802
See from her perspective so we can hear her understanding about how this will impact both her time with the city side and the time with the school district.

1232
02:01:49,622 --> 02:02:03,830
I may suggest that we make a motion, or I make a motion, that Resolution 2024-40 be sent to the Diversity, Equity, Inclusion Subcommittee, just so there's a little further review from us and some more consideration from the director.

1233
02:02:04,671 --> 02:02:07,132
And then we may reconvene for the full committee, I would say.

1234
02:02:07,152 --> 02:02:15,337
I think we have a meeting on the 16th of December, so just give us about a month and some change, just like a subcommittee meeting to further discuss.

1235
02:02:18,089 --> 02:02:19,911
I think a subcommittee meeting's great.

1236
02:02:20,051 --> 02:02:32,581
I would just ask for support on the resolution to continue this work tomorrow because, like the superintendent said, this list is extensive and the work she's doing in the schools cannot be ignored.

1237
02:02:32,601 --> 02:02:37,084
And it will, I'll say it again, it's a huge gap.

1238
02:02:38,586 --> 02:02:46,232
We're in meetings talking about school raises constantly and what we do on the city side is 2% for non-union.

1239
02:02:49,198 --> 02:03:16,179
I'm kind of a little, I struggle with city side employees, non-union taking on extra workloads in general, but especially when I ask for a list and it's this extensive after hearing repeated day after day, week after week on all that this one department head is doing for the schools, I think it's necessary to compensate her for such.

1240
02:03:16,860 --> 02:03:18,441
And I think it's completely fine

1241
02:03:19,375 --> 02:03:27,276
to have a subcommittee meeting and discuss it at our next December 16th regular meeting, but that's a month away.

1242
02:03:27,296 --> 02:03:30,517
And I think that's gonna create a huge gap for the city.

1243
02:03:30,577 --> 02:03:46,220
I just, this is an individual working very hard to help the schools and the message it would send to not move this forward tonight, even if it's just on a temporary basis or with a month, two, three, six month review,

1244
02:03:49,133 --> 02:03:53,059
respectfully ask my colleagues to try to do both at the same time.

1245
02:03:56,064 --> 02:03:57,345
Member Roussel, then member Ntapa.

1246
02:03:58,928 --> 02:03:59,368
Thank you.

1247
02:03:59,389 --> 02:04:03,395
I guess I'm not particularly enjoying the

1248
02:04:04,941 --> 02:04:10,902
on not veiled threat that tomorrow the work stops if we don't pass this, because that's what it is.

1249
02:04:11,862 --> 02:04:14,963
I would just say we've never authorized this work in the first place.

1250
02:04:15,443 --> 02:04:18,464
So we put the cart before the horse here.

1251
02:04:20,144 --> 02:04:21,404
And that wasn't my decision.

1252
02:04:23,105 --> 02:04:29,766
And so as a committee member, I'm going to second the motion to send it to subcommittee and not support this until we've had a chance to actually discuss it.

1253
02:04:30,026 --> 02:04:30,346
Thank you.

1254
02:04:33,743 --> 02:04:35,104
Remember and top up before I call the role.

1255
02:04:36,105 --> 02:04:40,128
I was just going to make another amendment to, um.

1256
02:04:41,089 --> 02:04:45,592
A lot of the temporary work until January 1 alongside sending its committee.

1257
02:04:47,193 --> 02:04:50,015
But, um, that's dependent on if you want to.

1258
02:04:50,956 --> 02:04:57,501
Take the amendment or not, but just to revisit it, if it's as dire as you're saying, and I are the same, you know, if this is unauthorized work.

1259
02:04:58,223 --> 02:05:16,014
You know, I don't, I can't wrap my head around that right now, but if this is work that needs to be directly done and needs to make, ensure that our families are getting the needs that they need, then I would be comfortable authorizing temporarily to be revisited on January 1 after findings from the subcommittee.

1260
02:05:16,034 --> 02:05:19,256
And that's the, I motion to amend that original motion.

1261
02:05:21,417 --> 02:05:26,921
Motion to send this to subcommittee as by member Olopade, amended by member

1262
02:05:27,836 --> 02:05:37,883
and Tapa to allow the work through January one, which I'm assuming will figure out by December 16th at our committee meeting anyway.

1263
02:05:38,143 --> 02:05:38,943
So thank you.

1264
02:05:39,263 --> 02:05:41,565
Is there a second on that motion?

1265
02:05:41,905 --> 02:05:50,611
Do you mean, are you trying to suggest that we skip voting on the amendment before we vote on the motion?

1266
02:05:51,854 --> 02:05:54,015
Would you like to sever the paper?

1267
02:05:54,115 --> 02:05:55,877
I mean, there's been an amendment offered.

1268
02:05:55,917 --> 02:05:56,997
We vote on an amendment.

1269
02:05:57,357 --> 02:05:58,598
That's how it's supposed to work.

1270
02:06:01,180 --> 02:06:02,321
Is there a second on the amendment?

1271
02:06:03,742 --> 02:06:05,202
I have a question before.

1272
02:06:05,222 --> 02:06:07,324
Member Reinfeldt?

1273
02:06:07,744 --> 02:06:10,726
Yeah, so the amendment is to allow the work.

1274
02:06:11,426 --> 02:06:15,169
Every single bullet point here is work that is already happening.

1275
02:06:16,690 --> 02:06:17,070
That's correct.

1276
02:06:20,742 --> 02:06:23,564
that was not necessarily authorized by me too.

1277
02:06:23,704 --> 02:06:25,805
It's just how it's happened.

1278
02:06:25,825 --> 02:06:30,088
I think when somebody has a knowledge base and is lending support, it's just.

1279
02:06:30,768 --> 02:06:38,133
And so this is work that's happening uncompensated or as part of the, this is part of the current position.

1280
02:06:39,414 --> 02:06:43,717
Dr. Edward-Vincent, this is work all currently taking place as far as I'm aware.

1281
02:06:44,297 --> 02:06:50,201
This work is currently taking place and it's inclusive of last year as well.

1282
02:06:51,750 --> 02:06:52,770
in different capacities.

1283
02:06:58,171 --> 02:07:09,953
She's overseeing all ADA accommodations for the district and supporting the district with DEI concerns, district wide, all units.

1284
02:07:14,014 --> 02:07:18,775
Supports us with interviews, supports HR, supports the office of the superintendent.

1285
02:07:19,744 --> 02:07:27,229
supports us with building and grounds concerns, this tremendous support that has been offered to the schools.

1286
02:07:28,350 --> 02:07:37,377
And these bullets detail the work that has been offered to the school.

1287
02:07:37,417 --> 02:07:41,600
She supported the district, new teacher orientation, DEI training.

1288
02:07:43,161 --> 02:07:47,764
Whenever she's called upon, she supports the district in any capacity that she can.

1289
02:07:52,759 --> 02:07:53,139
Thank you.

1290
02:07:59,003 --> 02:07:59,423
Member Graham?

1291
02:08:02,025 --> 02:08:09,030
Still unclear what the stipend is that we're tacitly approving and who is paying for it.

1292
02:08:12,772 --> 02:08:18,256
With the building and grounds consolidation, there is a small $7,500 stipend that HR

1293
02:08:21,776 --> 02:08:26,260
you know, did through evaluations, and the school district is paying for that.

1294
02:08:28,101 --> 02:08:37,709
So we're not talking a large amount of money, but just a stipend to compensate for all the work and hours that are put into this.

1295
02:08:37,729 --> 02:08:38,950
That's an annual stipend?

1296
02:08:40,010 --> 02:08:43,033
That was building and grounds, that's annual, yes.

1297
02:08:45,575 --> 02:08:50,157
It's not what we're talking about here, but we did not approve to pay for that stipend.

1298
02:08:50,377 --> 02:08:53,878
So I just want to point that out as we go forward.

1299
02:08:53,978 --> 02:08:58,620
If we're going to do these things, I think we need to be really clear about who's paying.

1300
02:08:58,660 --> 02:09:03,881
Like my understanding was that a stipend would be paid, but I was under the impression the city was going to pay for that.

1301
02:09:04,322 --> 02:09:08,223
And so now that's coming to our budget, which means this committee should be approving it.

1302
02:09:08,743 --> 02:09:10,244
and deciding on what's appropriate.

1303
02:09:10,324 --> 02:09:13,887
So I do think we have to get a little bit more precise.

1304
02:09:15,349 --> 02:09:19,012
When I look at this list, I understand that these are all things that have happened.

1305
02:09:19,612 --> 02:09:27,179
But I just have some real questions about why our central administration can't handle some of these things without Francis's support.

1306
02:09:27,679 --> 02:09:32,783
So I understand it's lovely and amazing to have somebody who you can call to provide

1307
02:09:33,544 --> 02:09:34,385
input and support.

1308
02:09:34,545 --> 02:09:38,107
I have colleagues like that all that I rely on in that same way.

1309
02:09:39,827 --> 02:09:45,731
But that's to me different than saying this is part of Francis's set of responsibilities.

1310
02:09:47,291 --> 02:09:56,056
What's not on here is any transition that would actually put the schools in a position to be able to do some of these things for themselves.

1311
02:09:57,850 --> 02:10:04,939
Particularly around accommodations, I don't know how many there are on an annual basis, but our HR team should be able to do this.

1312
02:10:05,980 --> 02:10:09,264
An HR department of 800 employees should be able to do this.

1313
02:10:09,364 --> 02:10:13,930
And I understand that that requires some specific training and we don't have that.

1314
02:10:13,990 --> 02:10:16,253
So I, I am, I'm fine with.

1315
02:10:16,833 --> 02:10:32,397
some of this stuff happening temporarily, but that's not what this says, which is why I am in favor of sending it to subcommittee so that we can ask our HR people and Francis to get in a room and talk about what is best for Medford Public Schools.

1316
02:10:33,878 --> 02:10:41,900
I would really prefer to hear from them about it than this group of people who's not involved in that work to decide that.

1317
02:10:43,195 --> 02:10:50,141
Um, I just, I have some, so I still, I know what I now know what we're paying already for his support.

1318
02:10:50,941 --> 02:10:53,963
Um, but I still don't think I know what the proposed stipend is here.

1319
02:10:54,024 --> 02:10:57,186
And if we are making a budget expenditure, we need to know what that is.

1320
02:11:03,111 --> 02:11:10,036
And I, to be honest, would have asked HR from this past, I'd asked both HR departments to

1321
02:11:10,595 --> 02:11:15,519
evaluate that and see if it's the same as facilities maintenance or if it should be more or less.

1322
02:11:15,619 --> 02:11:17,800
I don't have that answer.

1323
02:11:18,601 --> 02:11:21,503
I would assume it would be similar, but I don't have that answer.

1324
02:11:21,543 --> 02:11:25,166
I'm not in HR to do the proper evaluations.

1325
02:11:30,389 --> 02:11:33,512
I think that's part of what I'd love to hear a subcommittee

1326
02:11:34,369 --> 02:11:34,809
discuss.

1327
02:11:34,849 --> 02:11:49,557
I mean, I can I can do the math and say, all right, if it were if we're looking at 7500 for a year, and we're talking about a temporary acknowledgement and compensation for this work, we divide by 12 multiply by two months for November and December, that puts us at 1250.

1328
02:11:52,779 --> 02:12:02,584
Which I think was member in tapas to accept this through the end of the year, at which point the subcommittee will have assessed

1329
02:12:04,372 --> 02:12:23,122
and spoken with HR city schools to really figure out what is, what is the best use of, for instance, as time, what is the best use, what is the capacity within Medford public schools, because I really do think a lot of this capacity

1330
02:12:25,707 --> 02:12:32,212
It has to be in the schools that diversity, equity, inclusion permeates everything we do.

1331
02:12:32,432 --> 02:12:34,614
And it's gotta be built in.

1332
02:12:34,914 --> 02:12:44,622
It's gotta be part of the fabric of who we are and what we do and multiple people thinking of it, not just one person from the outside.

1333
02:12:46,583 --> 02:12:48,565
That's not the authentic work.

1334
02:12:49,656 --> 02:12:51,678
And I think that Frances does fantastic work.

1335
02:12:51,718 --> 02:12:53,239
I wanna be really clear about that.

1336
02:12:53,299 --> 02:12:54,560
And I really appreciate it.

1337
02:12:54,640 --> 02:12:59,365
I had no idea she was providing this support to the schools and I'm incredibly grateful.

1338
02:13:02,047 --> 02:13:08,172
And I don't want our students to suffer for these supports not being in place.

1339
02:13:08,252 --> 02:13:14,017
But I also think having one person do this work is not sustainable long-term.

1340
02:13:14,578 --> 02:13:15,539
And so I support

1341
02:13:16,977 --> 02:13:25,625
some acknowledgement of the temporary work, but not fully jumping on this model as written in perpetuity.

1342
02:13:25,645 --> 02:13:29,288
I completely agree with you.

1343
02:13:29,769 --> 02:13:30,550
I think because

1344
02:13:32,042 --> 02:13:34,664
Francis knows, and it's called upon to help.

1345
02:13:35,544 --> 02:13:36,485
She's going to help, however.

1346
02:13:36,505 --> 02:13:42,509
You can see it, all that she's done is in that list, and I'm sure it's even lengthier than that.

1347
02:13:43,510 --> 02:13:46,832
I do not want her to burn out doing all this work for Medford Public Schools.

1348
02:13:49,034 --> 02:13:49,974
We need her too much.

1349
02:13:52,836 --> 02:13:53,497
We as a city.

1350
02:13:53,557 --> 02:13:55,338
I don't want to lose her either, so.

1351
02:13:56,379 --> 02:13:57,099
Member Rousseau?

1352
02:13:58,640 --> 02:13:58,840
Yes.

1353
02:14:00,868 --> 02:14:07,494
I would certainly second the motion to approve this through December 31st of 2024.

1354
02:14:08,195 --> 02:14:16,002
And there's no reason we can't just do this with $7,500 annualized through that time.

1355
02:14:16,022 --> 02:14:19,945
But whatever the, what was the number?

1356
02:14:19,965 --> 02:14:23,649
Well, I mean, honestly, we should just start with July 1.

1357
02:14:25,740 --> 02:14:36,544
So, I mean, that's my recommendation is, so $3,750 through the December 31 date.

1358
02:14:37,224 --> 02:14:41,025
And if that's okay with Member Ntapa to amend that, and then.

1359
02:14:42,926 --> 02:14:44,006
Say that one more time, Member Russo.

1360
02:14:45,323 --> 02:14:52,787
Sure, so the motion I'm making is to approve 2024-40 through the end of December, through December 31st, 2024, with a compensation of 3,750 for July 1 to December 31.

1361
02:14:52,867 --> 02:14:54,087
So 7,500, but only for that short time.

1362
02:14:54,107 --> 02:14:55,088
Yes, that's great, thank you.

1363
02:14:55,108 --> 02:14:56,108
Member Ntapa?

1364
02:15:11,328 --> 02:15:17,572
I was just going to say that I accept the amendment to the amendment of including the language of July 1 through December 31.

1365
02:15:18,373 --> 02:15:18,753
Thank you.

1366
02:15:19,774 --> 02:15:21,855
I think this is just a different motion, actually.

1367
02:15:22,075 --> 02:15:22,916
But whatever.

1368
02:15:24,057 --> 02:15:24,577
Oh, all right.

1369
02:15:25,518 --> 02:15:31,762
And just so I'm clear, is that retro then?

1370
02:15:33,403 --> 02:15:34,404
Yeah, sure.

1371
02:15:35,225 --> 02:15:36,065
For the fiscal year 2025.

1372
02:15:36,185 --> 02:15:36,806
Fiscal year 2025, July 1.

1373
02:15:40,629 --> 02:15:42,390
the first half of fiscal year 2025.
