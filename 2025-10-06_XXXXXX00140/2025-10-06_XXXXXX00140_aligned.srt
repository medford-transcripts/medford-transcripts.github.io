Hey listeners, this is Danielle.

2
00:00:16,455 --> 00:00:16,956
And Shelley.

3
00:00:17,716 --> 00:00:20,357

And Danielle is a community mobilizer and changemaker.

5
00:00:24,018 --> 00:00:25,738
And this is the Medford Bites podcast.

6
00:00:26,998 --> 00:00:33,880
Every two weeks, we chew on the issues facing Medford and deliver bites of information about the city by lifting the expertise of our guests.

7
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,781
Join us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford.

8
00:00:38,201 --> 00:00:40,282
And as always, tell us where you like to eat.

9
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:44,812
you

10
00:00:52,339 --> 00:00:55,040
All right, so a little bit of a different setup for our episode today.

11
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:04,102
Today, myself, Danielle, and my guest are going to be talking about the upcoming ballot question about the Charter.

12
00:01:06,063 --> 00:01:15,766
We will start with our same questions, but since we were both on the committee to review the Charter, I think we're both sort of equal guests today.

13
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:20,027
So do you mind just saying your name and pronouns and who you are?

14
00:01:21,324 --> 00:01:22,845
Yes, thank you so much, Danielle.

15
00:01:22,905 --> 00:01:25,628
It's really great to be back on the podcast.

16
00:01:25,848 --> 00:01:29,371
I'm Milva McDonald, and my pronouns are she, her.

17
00:01:30,532 --> 00:01:37,819
And the restaurant question, I've been thinking about that, but you haven't asked it yet.

18
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:38,940
Yeah, no, no, it's OK.

19
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:39,640
Yeah, so yeah.

20
00:01:42,013 --> 00:01:43,353
We both were on the committee.

21
00:01:43,373 --> 00:01:46,314
You are definitely the one with all the knowledge.

22
00:01:46,894 --> 00:01:53,275
But so I think hopefully today we'll talk a little bit more about that process and what people can expect from the ballot question.

23
00:01:54,136 --> 00:02:04,658
But I'm wondering if I know you've answered this question a lot of times on this podcast, but if we could try one more time to say what your favorite place to eat is in Medford, what you like to eat there.

24
00:02:06,637 --> 00:02:10,838
Yeah, well, it's hard to pick one favorite, and I've said different things last time.

25
00:02:11,178 --> 00:02:14,659
I said the farmer's market, which is still a great choice.

26
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:20,181
I do like the Thai restaurant in Medford Square, Tom Young Kun.

27
00:02:21,181 --> 00:02:24,382
And I like, I mean, I like the Pad Thai.

28
00:02:24,642 --> 00:02:25,623
I like curry.

29
00:02:25,643 --> 00:02:26,683
I like the massaman curry.

30
00:02:28,103 --> 00:02:28,323
Great.

31
00:02:28,663 --> 00:02:33,425
I'll answer this one too, since we're almost, I guess, last night we got some sushi from

32
00:02:34,885 --> 00:02:44,774
Shanghai moon, which is like I've never really been inside there, but it's a pretty seems like a pretty cool spot to spend some time sometime But they have a nice like variety of different types of food.

33
00:02:44,814 --> 00:02:59,546
So All right, so we want to talk about the Charter I'm I wonder like I think we've talked on this podcast definitely before about I think the first time you were on we talked about just the efforts to

34
00:03:00,507 --> 00:03:02,709
get a committee to review the Charter.

35
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:09,855
And then I think we talked about that committee and then it's, you know, I think it's made a lot of progress in the last few years.

36
00:03:10,215 --> 00:03:15,560
And can you just give a little bit of an update about where we are right now in terms of reviewing the Charter?

37
00:03:16,249 --> 00:03:16,569
Yeah.

38
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:22,912
Um, so where we are right now is we are at the final step, which is the voters.

39
00:03:24,012 --> 00:03:29,694
Um, and the, the charter was the mayor appointed a committee, which you and I were both on.

40
00:03:29,754 --> 00:03:39,078
We spent almost two years doing public engagement or review, reviewing the charter, going through an article by article, the mayor and the city council then, um,

41
00:03:41,248 --> 00:03:50,694
had a negotiation, they worked through it, they made some changes, they came to an agreement, and then it was sent to the State House as a home rule petition, which is basically a bill.

42
00:03:51,575 --> 00:03:53,676
So it has to go through the process of any bill.

43
00:03:55,337 --> 00:03:57,739
And so it went through the House, it went through the Senate.

44
00:03:58,659 --> 00:04:07,982
The Senate had a few very minor changes, nothing substantive, just details, but that meant it had to go back to the House.

45
00:04:08,822 --> 00:04:18,726
And then it went back to the Senate, and then the governor signed it in mid-September, and that means the next stop is the voters, the ballot.

46
00:04:18,886 --> 00:04:22,347
And the state reviews it just to ensure that it complies with state law,

47
00:04:24,145 --> 00:04:29,509
You know, it's in alignment with what should be in a charter in Massachusetts, et cetera.

48
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:32,311
And now the voters get to decide.

49
00:04:32,331 --> 00:04:43,961
And the sample ballot is available on the website for the Charter's ballot question committee, which I know we're going to be talking about.

50
00:04:44,521 --> 00:04:45,822
And it's also on the city website.

51
00:04:45,862 --> 00:04:52,367
So people can actually see what their ballot looks like before they go vote, and they can read the question and the summary.

52
00:04:53,823 --> 00:04:58,866
Okay, so people that have been following the work on the charter, this is a big deal.

53
00:04:58,906 --> 00:05:05,390
For folks who like know nothing about it, what do you recommend that they look at or what do you recommend that they get to know before they vote?

54
00:05:06,243 --> 00:05:07,564
Okay, that's a great question.

55
00:05:09,285 --> 00:05:25,215
So the city will be putting out some information on their webpage about the question, but we have a ballot question committee and there's a website and it's www.medfordcharternow.com.

56
00:05:26,456 --> 00:05:31,739
It has a link to the current charter, links to the proposed charter,

57
00:05:32,568 --> 00:05:36,930
Link to the ballot so you can see it and it and it has summaries of.

58
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:45,154
You know, kind of what is a charter and what some of the proposed changes in the new charter are so, you know, I mean.

59
00:05:46,014 --> 00:05:49,816
Reading the chart, the propose the current our current charter is very short.

60
00:05:49,856 --> 00:05:50,877
It's about 2 pages.

61
00:05:50,897 --> 00:05:54,399
Um, but the proposed charter is much longer.

62
00:05:54,739 --> 00:05:54,859
Um.

63
00:05:55,739 --> 00:06:01,522
And it's comprehensive, whereas our current charter isn't so are the proposed charter is.

64
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,181
40 something pages.

65
00:06:03,261 --> 00:06:09,108
So there are summaries for people if they don't want to read the whole thing.

66
00:06:10,072 --> 00:06:15,674
Yeah, I think, too, the language in the charter can be a little hard to recall sometimes.

67
00:06:15,754 --> 00:06:18,095
And so, yeah, the summaries sound like they would be helpful.

68
00:06:18,696 --> 00:06:26,699
And I think if you, so to understand why we needed this charter, if you look at the current charter, is that there's very little information in there.

69
00:06:26,739 --> 00:06:32,482
And so it's, from my understanding, is that we just had to defer to state law for lots of things.

70
00:06:34,002 --> 00:06:36,323
And that maybe in line with kind of

71
00:06:38,806 --> 00:06:45,678
Maybe a stereotype, but I like a reputation of Medford is like that that made it easy to do kind of the things that we wanted to do without a lot of checks and balances.

72
00:06:48,038 --> 00:06:51,020
So, it sounds like there's a lot more detail in there.

73
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,904
Can you give just a summary of what the big changes are, or what the priorities are for change?

74
00:06:57,004 --> 00:06:58,345
Yeah, absolutely.

75
00:06:58,525 --> 00:07:06,751
But to your point that you just made, I mean, you remember when the Collins Center for Public Management that we worked with on the committee, we were fortunate to have them advising us.

76
00:07:08,552 --> 00:07:17,836
They sort of, we have a memo from them about the complexity of Medford's Charter, which sounds strange because Medford's Charter is only two pages long, right?

77
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:24,238
But the reason it's difficult is because there's almost nothing in it.

78
00:07:24,258 --> 00:07:34,402
So any questions that arise, you have to sort of find your way through state law, as you just said, and it can make things confusing.

79
00:07:36,178 --> 00:07:38,820
Yeah, exactly.

80
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:47,265
So, as far as the major as the changes in the charter, the charter sets out sort of establishes Medford as a city, and it lays out our form of government.

81
00:07:50,167 --> 00:07:57,732
The form of government, which is mayor council will remain, but the changes to the mayor's office are a 4 year term.

82
00:07:58,372 --> 00:08:07,561
Which is trending in Massachusetts and it makes sense for reasons, including, you know, executive tasks are more long term.

83
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,083
And so.

84
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:17,531
Giving the mayor 4 years means less time campaigning more time spent working on what the city needs.

85
00:08:19,642 --> 00:08:27,905
The other thing to them with the mayor is a term limit of four terms, so no mayor will be able to serve longer than 16 years.

86
00:08:30,106 --> 00:08:32,147
And as far as the city council.

87
00:08:33,067 --> 00:08:36,869
Ward representation, which is something that people have talked about.

88
00:08:37,069 --> 00:08:44,352
I mean, I've lived in the city for 32 years, and for most of that time, people have been talking about why don't we have ward representation?

89
00:08:44,872 --> 00:08:50,375
We're one of the only cities left in the state that does not have it.

90
00:08:51,435 --> 00:09:00,159
So that's a pretty big change, and it means our current council of seven at-large members would change to a hybrid

91
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:10,550
Council of 8 ward representatives 1 from each ward and 3 at large counselors, which is also the standard size for.

92
00:09:11,431 --> 00:09:14,434
Cities like ours, our council is the smallest.

93
00:09:15,738 --> 00:09:37,905
um and that number because we wanted to have you don't have to be able to break a tie but also not just a single at large exactly right we did you remember because we did say well we could do nine but that would mean one at large and the point of hybrid is that you sort of have a mix of both so yeah yeah that's why um

94
00:09:39,467 --> 00:09:43,829
you know, like Malden has eight wards and they have eight ward counselors, three at large.

95
00:09:44,749 --> 00:09:49,871
Somerville, I believe only has seven wards, but they still, they have 11, they have four at large.

96
00:09:49,911 --> 00:10:03,977
So they're still doing 11, but if we had had six wards, you know, then maybe we would have gone with nine, but it makes sense to do the 11 because of the hybrid.

97
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:06,078
The school committee,

98
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:13,088
will have localized representation, not ward, because that would have made the school committee much bigger.

99
00:10:13,268 --> 00:10:17,474
And, you know, we didn't really see a need to increase the size of the school committee.

100
00:10:18,335 --> 00:10:21,700
So, um, they'll still be 7 members.

101
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,663
4 of them will be from

102
00:10:24,398 --> 00:10:38,189
districts, so two wards will be combined to make a district, and then two at large and the mayor will remain on the school committee, but the school committee will elect its own chair, whereas currently our charter says the mayor is the chair.

103
00:10:40,191 --> 00:10:42,753
Under the new charter, the school committee will elect its own chair.

104
00:10:42,773 --> 00:10:51,701
And this was sort of a compromise because there was some interest in removing the mayor as the head of the school committee, but this gives a little bit more power back to the school committee.

105
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:57,802
Yeah, that was, that came up during the negotiations between the mayor and the city council.

106
00:10:58,422 --> 00:11:07,825
Um, the, um, yeah, it's, there's almost, I think there's maybe one, maybe two communities that don't have the mayor on the school committee.

107
00:11:08,645 --> 00:11:13,707
Um, but the mayor being chair is, you know, it's, it's not as common.

108
00:11:14,027 --> 00:11:15,208
It's, it's about half and half.

109
00:11:15,968 --> 00:11:22,090
Um, so, um, so that is, you know, that's one of the reasons that, um,

110
00:11:24,055 --> 00:11:30,358
It didn't, I mean, for many reasons, mayors are on school committees in Massachusetts because of the way schools are run in Massachusetts.

111
00:11:31,038 --> 00:11:36,360
And the budget is a huge part of, the school budget is a huge part of the city budget.

112
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:41,803
So having the mayor present and part of that, that's kind of the idea.

113
00:11:41,883 --> 00:11:46,725
It also gives the school committee members the mayor's ear every week.

114
00:11:47,745 --> 00:11:49,446
It gives the public a chance to interact.

115
00:11:52,442 --> 00:12:01,346
But in other states, maybe where they have county systems, whatever, the mayor's not necessarily as involved just because of the way their systems work.

116
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:09,770
Sure, so the mayor sets the budget, so there's an importance to having the mayor, whoever the mayor is.

117
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:12,151
I think that's the main reason, yeah.

118
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:17,213
And are there changes to how we do budgeting that are proposed in the charter?

119
00:12:17,963 --> 00:12:23,805
Um, well, you know, the budget processes are, are outlined in state law.

120
00:12:23,845 --> 00:12:37,749
So there's certain things that, you know, we have to do because of state law says so, but one thing that is new and we, and we've also had some improvements to our budget process with the recent budget ordinance passed by the city council.

121
00:12:37,849 --> 00:12:47,572
So, um, so there's that also, but in the charter, there's a requirement that there's an annual budget meeting with the mayor and the school committee

122
00:12:48,712 --> 00:12:52,173
and the city council sort of very early in the process.

123
00:12:52,233 --> 00:12:55,354
I think, I think the date was no later than February 15th.

124
00:12:55,454 --> 00:13:17,280
So that, that the intention of that is for these sort of three bodies to just communicate, um, and talk about the financial state of the city and the needs of the city and, and sort of get some, some of that think tanking, um, before the budget process begins.

125
00:13:19,214 --> 00:13:24,280
What are some other major changes or major just like additions that outline things more clearly in the charter?

126
00:13:25,682 --> 00:13:28,124
Okay, so we see the council school committee.

127
00:13:29,005 --> 00:13:36,034
Um, there are citizen participation mechanisms that we don't have in our charter now.

128
00:13:36,174 --> 00:13:36,514
So.

129
00:13:38,296 --> 00:13:39,538
It there's, um.

130
00:13:40,132 --> 00:13:48,581
A group petition, it was sometimes called a free petition where, and in the current proposed charter, it would be 100 signatures that.

131
00:13:50,503 --> 00:13:54,567
To put a measure to get the city council to put something on their agenda and talk about it.

132
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:58,651
you just need to get 100 signatures.

133
00:13:59,091 --> 00:14:07,695
Obviously, then people can do that now, they can contact city councilors, and then the city councilors will often bring those issues to the floor.

134
00:14:08,896 --> 00:14:23,542
This provision is meant to, if a resident doesn't get that response, then they have this option to get 100 people to sign a petition and get the city council to

135
00:14:25,013 --> 00:14:27,415
talk about their concern.

136
00:14:27,515 --> 00:14:32,979
It doesn't require that they do anything specific, but it means it has to be taken to the floor.

137
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,882
There's also provisions to put a measure on the ballot.

138
00:14:37,963 --> 00:14:50,653
So if there's something that we want to pass in the city or that some resident or group of residents wants to pass and they do the work of collecting the number of signatures required, it can get put on the ballot.

139
00:14:52,334 --> 00:14:52,714
Also,

140
00:14:54,017 --> 00:15:10,869
If the city council passes an ordinance and people say, you know, we don't agree with this and they get the required number of signatures, which is, you know, a lot, then they can put that on the ballot to, um, to say no to this referent to, to this, uh, measure.

141
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:13,631
Uh, there's also a provision to recall the mayor.

142
00:15:14,512 --> 00:15:18,074
So again, pretty big lift to recall the mayor.

143
00:15:18,114 --> 00:15:22,678
It can't be done frivolously, but if for some reason there's some,

144
00:15:24,267 --> 00:15:35,353
you know, big corruption happening or something that motivated a large enough group of residents to collect the signatures and vote the mayor out, that that is possible.

145
00:15:35,413 --> 00:15:37,955
Whereas it wasn't, it's not possible in our current charter.

146
00:15:38,662 --> 00:15:50,826
Oh, yeah, I was actually just looking at the charter for the city of Quincy because their mayor just recently like very publicly said some really upsetting things about basically denying that there was sexual abuse in the Catholic Church.

147
00:15:52,007 --> 00:15:54,468
So but like they don't they don't have term limits.

148
00:15:54,488 --> 00:15:55,368
They don't have anything like that.

149
00:15:55,388 --> 00:16:05,792
So it is like this sounds like giving more power to the residents and like just options that we can exercise if we don't, you know, if we don't feel satisfied with what's going on.

150
00:16:05,912 --> 00:16:06,052
Yeah.

151
00:16:06,397 --> 00:16:07,018
Absolutely.

152
00:16:07,178 --> 00:16:08,900
I mean, that was definitely the hope.

153
00:16:11,939 --> 00:16:14,340
Yeah, one other thing we talked about was.

154
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:22,582
Because the shift toward representation kind of shrinks the pool for each for each of those seats that what would happen?

155
00:16:22,702 --> 00:16:26,403
What would happen if we didn't get somebody running in a certain award?

156
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:28,424
So can you remind me what we decided?

157
00:16:28,464 --> 00:16:32,145
Yeah, so that was something that people brought up as a question.

158
00:16:32,405 --> 00:16:39,507
And when we talked to the call center about it, they basically said, you know, that doesn't generally happen, but there are provisions in state law if it doesn't.

159
00:16:40,576 --> 00:16:42,458
I mean, there's the option of writing it.

160
00:16:42,518 --> 00:16:44,059
People can write in a candidate.

161
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:51,545
But and then, you know, if that doesn't, yeah, usually that fixes it.

162
00:16:51,705 --> 00:16:58,431
But I mean, when we asked them about it, they I believe they said they didn't even know of a single case where that happened.

163
00:16:58,711 --> 00:17:02,514
I remember like this coming up a lot and falling back on that.

164
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:02,994
Yeah.

165
00:17:04,403 --> 00:17:11,152
I mean, because the other thing about ward representation is that it makes running for office a lot more accessible.

166
00:17:12,674 --> 00:17:19,422
Running in a ward of 7,000 to 8,000 people is hugely different from running in a city of 60,000.

167
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,922
Mailings are going to be a lot less.

168
00:17:26,643 --> 00:17:28,384
You're going to need a lot less literature.

169
00:17:28,404 --> 00:17:33,369
Your ability to actually hit a significant number of voters' doors.

170
00:17:34,349 --> 00:17:35,831
So it's just more manageable.

171
00:17:36,111 --> 00:17:46,900
And even when we did the listening sessions around the city with groups of people, there was a couple of times where people said, oh, yeah, maybe I would consider running if there were ward representation.

172
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:54,021
Yeah, so, um, so I think that the, the lowering the barriers to running for office, um.

173
00:17:54,702 --> 00:17:57,605
You know, could hopefully, um.

174
00:17:58,867 --> 00:18:03,172
Eliminate the problem of potential problem of not having candidates.

175
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:08,512
Yeah, so there were some other real beneficial things that we looked at in deciding this too.

176
00:18:08,612 --> 00:18:18,335
One is that we got a lot of support in the survey for this, but also the idea that all areas of Medford, so every ward would have some representation.

177
00:18:18,355 --> 00:18:28,059
And also, I think one piece of feedback or a worry from people was like, does this mean that there's only one person that we can go to

178
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:42,687
we need something and so of course the answer is no that like all all city councillors are still representing the city but that you'd have at least your ward councillor and then the three at-large people if you felt like maybe there was you couldn't reach out to the other wards.

179
00:18:43,128 --> 00:18:53,894
The other thing that I kept hearing and that I've learned a little bit more about since is how in Malden they are very like people have a lot of like pride around their their ward and they do things like

180
00:18:54,751 --> 00:19:09,856
uh, like, like 4th of July parties in each ward and things like that, which sounds like, you know, I think Medford is already a. Pretty like vibrant community, but to have that even smaller, like piece of the city that to sort of come together, it sounds like it would be really nice.

181
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:11,216
Absolutely.

182
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:15,758
And we, you know, we heard some of that when we did the listening sessions too.

183
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:23,420
Um, you know, I, I mean, I, there I've talked to people who will say,

184
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:27,632
You know, they've moved here from other cities and they're like, wait, Medford doesn't have order.

185
00:19:27,952 --> 00:19:29,073
There's no ward representative.

186
00:19:29,093 --> 00:19:31,035
That's weird.

187
00:19:31,255 --> 00:19:34,638
And it is weird, actually, in the context of a state.

188
00:19:36,749 --> 00:19:55,978
Yeah, and so another piece of feedback that I think people have, I've seen out there is that the amount of money that this would cost to increase the size of the council, things like their salary, staff, like also the space where they have their meetings in the city council chambers.

189
00:19:57,819 --> 00:19:59,260
So I don't know what you think about that.

190
00:20:00,318 --> 00:20:03,361
I mean, as you know, I'm sure you remember that this did come up.

191
00:20:03,881 --> 00:20:07,144
People on the committee were like, oh, well, will people worry about the cost?

192
00:20:07,244 --> 00:20:19,074
And one of the things that we kept coming back to on the committee was that our job was to determine what the best form of government for Medford would be.

193
00:20:19,754 --> 00:20:23,817
So, you know, better government is

194
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:27,031
priceless maybe, I would say.

195
00:20:27,171 --> 00:20:35,313
And the other thing is, yeah, there would be four more salaries, but the charter doesn't say what any salaries are.

196
00:20:36,393 --> 00:20:44,875
The salaries get decided on by the council for the next mayor, the next school committee and the next city council.

197
00:20:45,495 --> 00:20:48,676
So the idea of a council giving itself a raise is not

198
00:20:49,752 --> 00:20:54,294
they give the next council a raise or not.

199
00:20:56,114 --> 00:21:03,017
Salaries can be changed in any direction, so it's not set in stone the amount of money that it will cost.

200
00:21:03,737 --> 00:21:11,400
That's something that will get worked out and fitting for more people up there will also have to get worked out.

201
00:21:12,782 --> 00:21:22,253
The city hall chambers, the entire building has to be maintained regardless of whether we have ward representation.

202
00:21:22,313 --> 00:21:26,657
So it's not as though there's a zero cost to doing nothing.

203
00:21:28,439 --> 00:21:31,403
So, you know, those are some of my thoughts about that.

204
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:37,023
And I do wonder if there is an assumption by people that we don't have word representation because we don't want it.

205
00:21:37,063 --> 00:21:38,884
And I think that's not right.

206
00:21:38,924 --> 00:21:42,906
It sounds like there's been no, because there's been no change to the charter for so long.

207
00:21:43,326 --> 00:21:45,347
There's no way to know if people wanted it.

208
00:21:45,928 --> 00:21:50,310
Um, and that's, and that's left us like behind a lot of other cities and in a lot of these ways.

209
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,851
Yeah, absolutely.

210
00:21:52,391 --> 00:21:52,691
Yeah.

211
00:21:52,831 --> 00:21:56,333
I mean, interestingly, there was a charter review in 1978.

212
00:21:56,653 --> 00:21:59,515
That was our last full review.

213
00:21:59,535 --> 00:21:59,955
Um, and.

214
00:22:02,628 --> 00:22:12,551
I have the report, and they actually did recommend district representation or more localized representation, but that charter didn't pass.

215
00:22:13,371 --> 00:22:17,992
The big issue that people cared about at that time was city manager versus mayor.

216
00:22:18,052 --> 00:22:28,615
Medford had a city manager, and that charter review commission did not recommend changing to mayor from city manager.

217
00:22:30,175 --> 00:22:36,198
We can't know for sure why that charter got voted down, but I think that's 1 of the reasons because that was the main issue.

218
00:22:36,218 --> 00:22:44,043
And then in 1986, it wasn't a full charter review, but the city switched to mayor.

219
00:22:44,063 --> 00:22:44,103
So.

220
00:22:47,253 --> 00:22:58,265
Yeah, so that's, um, so, yeah, that's the last time, but, you know, as I said, anecdotally, I know people talk about it a lot word representation and have been for a while.

221
00:22:58,526 --> 00:23:06,014
And, you know, it clearly from the survey and from talking to people when we did the committee, it was on people's minds.

222
00:23:06,713 --> 00:23:20,800
Yeah, and I think that's another piece of feedback that I've seen flying around there that doesn't seem well informed, but that we didn't get a lot of community input or we didn't listen to that community, but then also the ways that our committee was formed like we were appointed by the mayor.

223
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,561
There's been some criticism of that.

224
00:23:23,161 --> 00:23:23,461
I do.

225
00:23:23,541 --> 00:23:24,182
Well, I remember.

226
00:23:25,528 --> 00:23:41,627
entering all that survey stuff into the into the form that we used and we got like I think we got over was like around like 600 or almost 700 responses it was almost 700 which is like a lot I think for like that's way more people than I would have imagined

227
00:23:42,383 --> 00:23:44,144
cared about learning about the church.

228
00:23:44,184 --> 00:23:45,225
Yeah.

229
00:23:45,505 --> 00:23:52,950
And we did have a person on our committee who's in grad school and who's an expert in statistics.

230
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:59,794
And, you know, he assured us that it was statistically significant, that it was a really good response.

231
00:24:00,074 --> 00:24:00,795
For sure.

232
00:24:00,855 --> 00:24:03,156
And I think too about the, like, I was

233
00:24:04,097 --> 00:24:13,604
I'll say like a little intimidated by the makeup of the committee when we first started, because I could acknowledge that there were people on there that I just don't agree with on much.

234
00:24:14,324 --> 00:24:25,452
But I think the process that we went through, I think it's proof that this is not like a political issue, that this is something that we all cared about doing what was best for our city.

235
00:24:25,492 --> 00:24:30,756
And the Collins Center really helped to advise us on what those things would look like.

236
00:24:32,497 --> 00:24:44,307
Um, I think sometimes we struggled with like, um, or some of us struggled with like seeing these changes as impacting our governance rather than like any specific people in those positions.

237
00:24:44,927 --> 00:24:55,676
Um, but I really think that like, it was a really good mix of people and different ideas and people were pretty respectful generally about hearing all those ideas.

238
00:24:55,736 --> 00:25:00,440
And so, I mean, I think for that feedback that we were chosen by the mayor, like sure.

239
00:25:01,255 --> 00:25:05,620
And I actually think it was a pretty good group to do this work.

240
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:09,584
And lots of people that dedicated a lot of time, way more than I did.

241
00:25:09,604 --> 00:25:10,545
Yeah.

242
00:25:10,885 --> 00:25:12,367
Well, no, you did plenty, Danielle.

243
00:25:12,407 --> 00:25:14,929
You were a great, great member of the team.

244
00:25:17,052 --> 00:25:20,555
I'm glad you brought this up because, you know, I agree with you.

245
00:25:20,635 --> 00:25:24,099
I mean, one of the things about the sort of

246
00:25:25,335 --> 00:25:33,582
The thing that we sort of tried to keep focused on, which was that this is not about sort of the current situation now or who's in office now.

247
00:25:35,464 --> 00:25:41,610
And so we had to think about it that way and remind ourselves of that sometimes, but it was.

248
00:25:43,565 --> 00:25:58,559
It was inherently I feel that the process was inherently a political while we were doing it and I think that was really valuable and and especially in the current environment, you know, having a group of people be able to come together who don't.

249
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:07,085
always see eye to eye on everything, but come together to work on something that's this important to the city in a positive way.

250
00:26:07,105 --> 00:26:10,147
Yeah, I felt really good about that.

251
00:26:10,267 --> 00:26:15,490
And so I'm glad that it worked out that way.

252
00:26:16,411 --> 00:26:21,454
And I think the balance was important overall.

253
00:26:21,886 --> 00:26:23,167
you know, for the city too.

254
00:26:23,467 --> 00:26:25,128
So yeah.

255
00:26:25,288 --> 00:26:30,011
And so just to summarize, you're saying our, our charter hasn't been changed.

256
00:26:30,051 --> 00:26:31,852
It hasn't been reviewed since the seventies.

257
00:26:32,452 --> 00:26:42,938
There was an update in 1986 about changing to mayor, but we haven't had like a successful, like change or like, you know, whatever, like rewriting of the charter.

258
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:44,422
in a long, long time.

259
00:26:44,582 --> 00:26:47,283
And our group worked for about two years, right?

260
00:26:48,104 --> 00:26:49,084
It was almost two, yeah.

261
00:26:49,124 --> 00:26:57,709
Before that, you all, like the citizens-led committee, were working for like a decade to 15 years or along to try to get this going, right?

262
00:26:58,370 --> 00:26:58,730
Yeah.

263
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:04,774
So that's, and I'm glad you brought this up because this is actually one of the really most important things in the new charter.

264
00:27:06,635 --> 00:27:10,777
One of the most important things in the new charter is provisions for regular charter review.

265
00:27:12,483 --> 00:27:18,747
what the process that you just talked about, it's been on and off for about 15 years.

266
00:27:19,848 --> 00:27:36,260
There's a way that cities can do a charter review that involves collecting signatures from 15% of registered voters, which in Medford at this point would, well, you have to have a cushion too, just because some of the signatures will be rejected for various reasons.

267
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,280
So you need about six to 7,000.

268
00:27:40,114 --> 00:27:45,135
There were residents, Michael Ruggiero, who used to live here, was a big proponent.

269
00:27:45,856 --> 00:27:52,157
Jim Silva, Neil Osborne, these people were working really hard just to get a charter review.

270
00:27:52,357 --> 00:27:57,918
And then we had a couple of home rule petitions to try to get the city council to agree to

271
00:28:01,432 --> 00:28:04,856
To review the charter and for various reasons that didn't work out.

272
00:28:05,357 --> 00:28:06,378
So, yeah, it was.

273
00:28:07,259 --> 00:28:12,325
It was years of trying to just get a look at the charter to review it.

274
00:28:12,586 --> 00:28:13,567
And then finally.

275
00:28:14,668 --> 00:28:19,254
We figured out that that we could just have an appointed committee and that's actually how most cities do it.

276
00:28:21,637 --> 00:28:29,220
And then once it's in the charter, then we will never have to worry about this again, because it will be reviewed every 10 years.

277
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:41,985
The 1st review in our charter would would be required to happen within 5 years, which makes sense because it's been so long and we want to just make sure that sort of it's a check up on how things are working.

278
00:28:42,045 --> 00:28:43,205
Are these changes working?

279
00:28:43,225 --> 00:28:44,026
Etcetera.

280
00:28:45,426 --> 00:28:47,027
But then it will be reviewed every 10 years.

281
00:28:47,207 --> 00:28:47,447
So.

282
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:55,755
As the city changes, as the needs of the city change, we can make sure that the city government reflects that.

283
00:28:56,637 --> 00:29:12,301
Yeah, and I think that's a good point as well, because of course we have a lot of confidence in the work that we did, and we can't predict how it'll all go, so we'll have the opportunity to look at it again in five years, and then everything after that, so I felt that.

284
00:29:13,461 --> 00:29:22,323
Yeah, and the Charter defines what the next Charter Review Committee, how it will be chosen, and the way it's

285
00:29:23,205 --> 00:29:28,008
The way it's laid out in our charter is that the mayor will appoint it's 9 members.

286
00:29:28,188 --> 00:29:31,749
The mayor appoints 3, the council appoints 3 and the school committee appoints 3.

287
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:40,134
So, um, so it will be appointees from those 3 bodies and.

288
00:29:40,991 --> 00:29:48,753
they will review the charter and, you know, it will be important to look at it and hopefully it won't be as big of a process as ours.

289
00:29:48,813 --> 00:29:50,033
Although maybe, I don't know.

290
00:29:50,053 --> 00:29:53,194
I mean, we were sort of like, okay.

291
00:29:53,214 --> 00:30:06,977
I remember when the Collins Center gave us that model charter and they gave us a document at the beginning of the process with a model charter that's a modern charter.

292
00:30:07,098 --> 00:30:08,898
And then they sort of put a little,

293
00:30:10,042 --> 00:30:39,246
know about this is what Medford's charter says about all these sections and for at least half maybe more there was there wasn't even anything it's like Medford doesn't have this Medford doesn't have this so yeah yeah I think it'll be like I think if you know hopefully this passes and I think it'll be a nice change and I and I do think because we're saying like this is not a political issue it does give a little bit more oversight to how things are done so that and a little bit more clarity and transparency right so like we know

294
00:30:39,646 --> 00:30:40,847
how things should work now.

295
00:30:41,267 --> 00:30:42,909
It'll be written more clearly.

296
00:30:43,769 --> 00:30:53,236
Yeah, and there's, you know, there's a regular review of ordinance required in the charter, which I think is also really important to the city.

297
00:30:55,138 --> 00:31:01,663
Just also procedures that don't exist in our current charter, like vacancies.

298
00:31:02,283 --> 00:31:04,845
We had a situation where a school committee member resigned

299
00:31:05,995 --> 00:31:13,640
a couple of years ago, and I think behind the scenes, it was a little complicated, and what do we do now?

300
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,521
And they had to sort of try to figure it out.

301
00:31:16,582 --> 00:31:23,546
If that happened with the mayor, it would be probably a crisis for the city without knowing what do we do?

302
00:31:23,606 --> 00:31:24,647
The mayor can't serve.

303
00:31:25,488 --> 00:31:31,792
And there's literally nothing in our charter that says what would happen or what we should do.

304
00:31:32,365 --> 00:31:37,307
So passing this charter, you know, has, has that in it as well.

305
00:31:39,027 --> 00:31:39,308
Great.

306
00:31:39,848 --> 00:31:43,509
Was there anything else that we haven't talked about that we should mention before we wrap up?

307
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:56,414
You know, just this, the city council also will get a little more, more power to confirm appointments to multi-member boards.

308
00:31:57,034 --> 00:31:59,755
So the mayor makes the appointments, but the city council can

309
00:32:01,068 --> 00:32:04,093
has 30 days to reject an appointment.

310
00:32:05,475 --> 00:32:12,105
So that gives them more, it's a more collaborative process than we have now.

311
00:32:12,125 --> 00:32:12,505
And

312
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:25,977
You know, the other thing when you brought up the City Council, the, you know, the salaries or whatnot, the City Council will be able to hire staff, but subject to appropriation.

313
00:32:26,217 --> 00:32:34,083
And I think that's the piece that people, and also necessary expenses can be reimbursed, but it's all subject to appropriation.

314
00:32:34,843 --> 00:32:44,089
And those were provisions that, you know, are pretty common in other charters, but some people around town, I think, have been concerned about how much money that would cost.

315
00:32:45,415 --> 00:32:48,999
It's subject to appropriation, which means it has to go through the budget process.

316
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:55,946
The City Council can't just say we're going to hire this person or I want expenses for this, that, and the other thing.

317
00:32:56,326 --> 00:33:00,190
And part of that, I think it was related to them hiring their own like legal counsel.

318
00:33:01,172 --> 00:33:04,234
Yeah, but the charter doesn't say that.

319
00:33:04,354 --> 00:33:07,676
It just says that they can hire staff subject to appropriation.

320
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:17,223
So if there's a need and they can appropriate it in the budget and the money is there, then they can hire people.

321
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:22,874
It's not uncommon for cities, city councils to have a staff person other.

322
00:33:23,114 --> 00:33:25,576
I mean, our city council has a city clerk.

323
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:30,139
They traditionally had another position called the city messenger.

324
00:33:30,259 --> 00:33:33,522
So that is actually retained in the charter as an assistant.

325
00:33:34,102 --> 00:33:36,324
So they do have those positions, but.

326
00:33:37,605 --> 00:33:43,411
You know, as a body, it's not uncommon for a city council to need help with things.

327
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:49,677
And so that option will be there if the money is there and if it's appropriated.

328
00:33:50,078 --> 00:33:56,122
Yeah, I always find the conversations about the city council's salary to be a really tough one.

329
00:33:56,743 --> 00:34:11,993
I hear this argument sometimes that they shouldn't be paid anything, that it's a public service, and I don't think that's fair, obviously, but I think the demand on them is also so high that

330
00:34:12,573 --> 00:34:17,976
it's hard to hear, they don't deserve more money, and they're not doing enough, and like all these things.

331
00:34:18,036 --> 00:34:20,618
And so, you know, I think that's a tough conversation.

332
00:34:20,638 --> 00:34:22,679
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

333
00:34:22,819 --> 00:34:26,441
I mean, it is a time-consuming job.

334
00:34:26,641 --> 00:34:32,685
It is a public service, but there's plenty of public service jobs where people are compensated.

335
00:34:33,525 --> 00:34:34,566
Yeah, yeah.

336
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,307
So, but, you know, the other

337
00:34:38,602 --> 00:34:49,632
you know, hopefully ward counselors, a bigger council will also spread the work around and, and, and, you know, even if it costs the city more money, what we would get back.

338
00:34:50,457 --> 00:34:54,279
will make up for that and hopefully more than make up for it.

339
00:34:54,299 --> 00:35:00,702
Because the other constituent services can be improved with ward representation.

340
00:35:00,742 --> 00:35:04,984
You talked about the closer relationship that constituents can have with their ward counselors.

341
00:35:05,004 --> 00:35:15,569
All those subcommittee work that has to get done, the work will be able to be spread around a little more.

342
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:17,030
Yeah.

343
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:18,891
I also think that when that conversation about

344
00:35:20,282 --> 00:35:31,578
Compensation for the school committee or for the city council committee is like it doesn't I think if we're looking at it from like an equity perspective like one of the reasons for word representation was making it easier for people to run and.

345
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:40,027
hopefully getting a more diverse city council and diversity in, I would love that all types of ways, right?

346
00:35:40,087 --> 00:35:43,289
Not just like ethnic or racial diversity, but socioeconomic.

347
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:48,031
And if you're getting paid $20,000 a year, like you can't live on that.

348
00:35:48,051 --> 00:35:49,332
Yeah, no, absolutely.

349
00:35:50,372 --> 00:35:50,912
Absolutely.

350
00:35:50,972 --> 00:35:54,414
City councilors do have other jobs and need to.

351
00:35:56,595 --> 00:36:12,843
But and we, we can't know for sure who will run or how it will affect who is on our council, but we did, but it is well established in studies that word representation improves descriptive representation, meaning.

352
00:36:13,803 --> 00:36:15,164
you know, who is on the council.

353
00:36:15,284 --> 00:36:23,550
So more diversity, ethnically, racially, economically, what you mentioned.

354
00:36:24,751 --> 00:36:28,714
Because it just, it opens the door for more people to be able to do it.

355
00:36:31,136 --> 00:36:34,278
Yeah, so much to think about there.

356
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:38,401
So you mentioned the ballot question committee, is that what it's called?

357
00:36:38,661 --> 00:36:38,921
Yeah.

358
00:36:39,221 --> 00:36:40,562
What do you want people to know about that?

359
00:36:41,303 --> 00:36:42,223
Well, it's just,

360
00:36:43,608 --> 00:36:54,035
You know, it's in Massachusetts to advocate for a ballot question or, you know, we wanted to get the word out with literature, with signs.

361
00:36:55,456 --> 00:36:59,978
And that is a, since it's on the ballot, you have to form a committee.

362
00:37:01,459 --> 00:37:03,861
It's not like a political action committee.

363
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:07,003
It's just exclusively formed to advocate for this one question.

364
00:37:08,146 --> 00:37:11,448
And then that allowed us to raise money so that we could put out.

365
00:37:11,568 --> 00:37:12,749
So we have signs.

366
00:37:12,829 --> 00:37:24,215
If anybody wants to put up a Medford Charter Now lawn sign, you can just go to the website medfordcharternow.com or email info at medfordcharternow.com.

367
00:37:24,876 --> 00:37:35,381
We also have literature and we have a palm card with information about the charter because we just want to make sure that people know that this is going to be on the ballot and have information about it.

368
00:37:37,911 --> 00:37:44,500
So, uh, if if anybody wants to volunteer to do some lit dropping in their neighborhood, you can do that too.

369
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:45,602
Just give us an email.

370
00:37:46,623 --> 00:37:50,088
Send us an email and, um, yeah, it's just.

371
00:37:51,365 --> 00:37:53,266
You know, I mean, a lot of people are busy.

372
00:37:53,326 --> 00:37:54,167
They're very busy.

373
00:37:54,247 --> 00:37:59,890
They don't always know what's going on before they, you know, get to the ballot box.

374
00:38:01,171 --> 00:38:09,496
So we're just, we want us to spread awareness and let people know that this is happening and that it's a big deal for the city.

375
00:38:09,536 --> 00:38:11,057
I mean, it's really huge.

376
00:38:12,118 --> 00:38:18,222
You know, it can be sort of not that exciting, I guess, to talk about the charter and it's a little wonky, you know.

377
00:38:19,062 --> 00:38:46,018
But it's a very big deal for the city and yeah, passing it means that we will have a modern charter, we will have provisions that are necessary that we don't have now, and it means that we'll be able to review it regularly and we won't have to go through this battle ever again of, come on, let's review the charter, which sometimes elected officials might

378
00:38:47,160 --> 00:39:01,448
resist because some of the changes are maybe a little concerning if you're an elected official, if they're going to change your term or put a term limit on or things like that.

379
00:39:02,829 --> 00:39:09,932
But we will have a review every 10 years and the first one in five if we pass this.

380
00:39:11,393 --> 00:39:14,035
I'm wondering, you've been working on this for a really long time.

381
00:39:14,993 --> 00:39:19,518
If, you know, we hope that this ballot measure passes, how are you going to celebrate?

382
00:39:20,659 --> 00:39:21,741
That's a good question.

383
00:39:21,761 --> 00:39:31,191
I'm actually, the day after election day, I'm supposed to go and do childcare for my granddaughter in Montreal.

384
00:39:31,271 --> 00:39:33,574
So I'll be celebrating maybe with her.

385
00:39:35,033 --> 00:39:40,379
But maybe, I mean, how I will celebrate actually really is rest.

386
00:39:40,759 --> 00:39:48,227
You know, because it has been a lot, it's been a lot for the last few years.

387
00:39:49,368 --> 00:39:50,289
It's a lot of work.

388
00:39:52,183 --> 00:39:55,606
I want to see the work through and get it all the way to the finish line.

389
00:39:56,647 --> 00:39:58,469
This is a huge accomplishment for the city.

390
00:39:58,529 --> 00:40:00,150
Charter change is not easy.

391
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:07,437
So getting, getting this through is, it's a huge step forward really.

392
00:40:07,968 --> 00:40:12,433
For the city, so, um, so, yeah, I'll celebrate by sort of relaxing.

393
00:40:12,453 --> 00:40:14,416
I love to get it.

394
00:40:14,976 --> 00:40:15,177
All right.

395
00:40:15,197 --> 00:40:23,266
So I'll put all that information in the show notes and hopefully folks that don't have time to really dig into it themselves can at least listen to this podcast and hear a little bit of a summary.

396
00:40:24,167 --> 00:40:24,328
But.

397
00:40:25,278 --> 00:40:26,880
Yeah, and thank you, Daniel.

398
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:41,014
And I just want to thank you for being on the committee and all the other committee members and every single person who responded to the survey or came to a listening session, or it takes the time to even to learn about this and vote on it.

399
00:40:41,275 --> 00:40:46,140
And all the city officials that we interviewed, it really was a

400
00:40:47,948 --> 00:40:50,430
It involved a lot of people around the city.

401
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:53,852
And now I'm excited that the voters get a chance.

402
00:40:54,013 --> 00:40:56,975
So thank you to everybody for whatever your role was.

403
00:40:56,995 --> 00:40:58,015
For sure, yeah.

404
00:40:58,156 --> 00:40:59,176
And thank you to you, Melva.

405
00:40:59,236 --> 00:41:00,617
I feel like you really led the charge.

406
00:41:00,677 --> 00:41:03,760
And I'm sure you had a lot of late nights and early mornings because of this.

407
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,921
So hopefully we get through the finish line.

408
00:41:06,802 --> 00:41:07,422
Absolutely.

409
00:41:08,283 --> 00:41:08,803
Thanks, Melva.

410
00:41:09,364 --> 00:41:09,644
Thank you.
