00:00:45,351 --> 00:00:48,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. DiClemente served his country during the Korean War.

9
00:00:48,573 --> 00:00:50,634
[SPEAKER_03]: He, along with his wife, volunteered running the St.

10
00:00:50,674 --> 00:00:52,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Francis Food Pantry for 32 years.

11
00:00:52,575 --> 00:00:56,517
[SPEAKER_03]: He was also honored as Citizen of the Year, along with his wife, Jerry, for their work in the community.

12
00:00:56,897 --> 00:00:58,798
[SPEAKER_03]: His presence in our community will be missed.

13
00:00:59,558 --> 00:01:00,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Caraviello.

14
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:01,359
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Madam President.

15
00:01:03,211 --> 00:01:08,655
[SPEAKER_09]: For those who don't know the DiClemente family, you want to talk about a family that is the salt of the earth?

16
00:01:09,276 --> 00:01:11,157
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Mr. and Mrs. DiClemente.

17
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:15,760
[SPEAKER_09]: They ran the St.

18
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:22,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Francis food pantry for 32 years, pretty much on a volunteer organization.

19
00:01:25,762 --> 00:01:28,182
[SPEAKER_09]: Talk about somebody also flew under the radar.

20
00:01:28,763 --> 00:01:34,004
[SPEAKER_09]: No one ever, no accolades were ever asked for or given to him and his wife.

21
00:01:34,984 --> 00:01:38,765
[SPEAKER_09]: The only accolade they ever got was they were husband and wife citizen of the year.

22
00:01:39,445 --> 00:01:45,986
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, it just goes to say, you know, their work in the community was just outstanding.

23
00:01:46,046 --> 00:01:50,227
[SPEAKER_09]: And as Councilor Scarpelli keeps mentioning, nobody's stepping in.

24
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:55,413
[SPEAKER_09]: to fill another giant set of shoes in the community.

25
00:01:55,953 --> 00:02:08,620
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just want to thank Mr. DiClemente for all his years of service to our community, and hopefully someone will step up to fill those shoes going forward.

26
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:09,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

27
00:02:09,741 --> 00:02:10,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli.

28
00:02:11,504 --> 00:02:14,566
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President, Councilor Cavillo, thanks for putting this forward.

29
00:02:15,686 --> 00:02:18,308
[SPEAKER_06]: I've known the DiClemente family since I was a baby.

30
00:02:19,488 --> 00:02:21,630
[SPEAKER_06]: Mom and dad worked side by side with them at St.

31
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:25,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Francis for almost every fundraising event for the church and the community.

32
00:02:26,252 --> 00:02:36,677
[SPEAKER_06]: And Mr. and Mrs. DiClemente took over so many other efforts to help the members of this community, one mostly being the food pantry.

33
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,241
[SPEAKER_06]: he would be there and he's stickler.

34
00:02:39,261 --> 00:02:45,503
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, he, you know, the stories are well-known that he wanted to make sure every family was serviced.

35
00:02:45,623 --> 00:03:02,730
[SPEAKER_06]: So a gentleman, someone that we'll miss and to his wife, Jerry, I know that when you lose your second, your half like that, it's difficult, but just to let her know that the community supports her and are behind her and we send our condolences.

36
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:03,290
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you.

37
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

38
00:03:05,131 --> 00:03:07,292
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion of Councilor Caraviello, seconded by

39
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,281
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli.

40
00:03:09,641 --> 00:03:10,222
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

41
00:03:10,242 --> 00:03:11,523
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

00:03:11,563 --> 00:03:12,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

43
00:03:12,143 --> 00:03:27,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Please rise for a moment of silence.

44
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,797
[SPEAKER_03]: 23-075 offered by Councilor Caraviello.

45
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:34,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council commend and congratulate Joan Gatto on being selected as this year's Citizen of the Year.

46
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:35,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Caraviello.

47
00:03:35,427 --> 00:03:36,527
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Madam President.

48
00:03:37,027 --> 00:03:40,548
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the Chamber of Commerce couldn't have made a better choice for the citizen here.

49
00:03:40,588 --> 00:03:48,530
[SPEAKER_09]: Joan, small business owner from West Medford for many, many years, volunteering the community, really out there.

50
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:51,811
[SPEAKER_09]: Anytime anyone asks anything, Joan steps up.

51
00:03:52,491 --> 00:03:59,212
[SPEAKER_09]: I know she does a lot for the firemen, especially in the West Medford area, but another superwoman.

52
00:03:59,972 --> 00:04:01,813
[SPEAKER_09]: And I say, I think,

53
00:04:03,313 --> 00:04:04,314
[SPEAKER_09]: Chamber could have made a better choice.

54
00:04:04,354 --> 00:04:05,494
[SPEAKER_09]: So congratulations to Joan.

55
00:04:06,055 --> 00:04:08,897
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think the banquet is on April 27th.

56
00:04:09,117 --> 00:04:12,079
[SPEAKER_09]: And for anyone who wants to go, thank you.

57
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:12,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

58
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:13,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli.

59
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:18,863
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you again, Madam President, Councilor Caraviello.

60
00:04:19,203 --> 00:04:20,144
[SPEAKER_06]: Joan is a legend.

61
00:04:20,984 --> 00:04:26,288
[SPEAKER_06]: It's funny when you first ran, when I first ran for school committee, someone said, you need to go sit with Joan.

62
00:04:27,228 --> 00:04:29,630
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think you can get elected if Joan's not supporting you.

63
00:04:30,427 --> 00:04:31,988
[SPEAKER_06]: and that's the type of person she was.

64
00:04:32,529 --> 00:04:36,231
[SPEAKER_06]: And what she'll tell you is the truth, the honest to goodness truth.

65
00:04:36,311 --> 00:04:44,657
[SPEAKER_06]: So she was someone that always, again, always the first business to give, and always willing to help anybody in need.

66
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:49,040
[SPEAKER_06]: So congratulations to a fine, deserving individual.

67
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,321
[SPEAKER_06]: So congratulations.

68
00:04:50,801 --> 00:04:51,122
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

69
00:04:52,943 --> 00:04:54,444
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion, Councilor Knight.

70
00:04:54,784 --> 00:04:56,025
[SPEAKER_17]: Madam President, thank you very much.

71
00:04:56,245 --> 00:04:58,467
[SPEAKER_17]: Growing up in West Medford, I too had the opportunity

72
00:04:59,973 --> 00:05:08,559
[SPEAKER_17]: Knowing Joan Gatto for a number of years, I grew up with her daughter, Julie, and I actually was at her daughter, Julie's wedding when she married my dear close friend, David Topper.

73
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:12,442
[SPEAKER_17]: And over the years, she's been a fixture in the West Medford community, a fixture at the St.

74
00:05:12,742 --> 00:05:21,208
[SPEAKER_17]: Raphael's Parish, and someone that's always been willing to put herself out there for the community, a volunteer, someone that puts her money where her mouth is.

75
00:05:21,228 --> 00:05:22,169
[SPEAKER_17]: She puts community first.

76
00:05:22,309 --> 00:05:27,633
[SPEAKER_17]: And when you go down to her muffin shop in West Medford, you can see that it's a place where relationships are made.

77
00:05:28,017 --> 00:05:31,040
[SPEAKER_17]: where communities developed, and it's really something that makes Medford a great place.

78
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,263
[SPEAKER_17]: It's really something that helps build the fabric of our community.

79
00:05:34,303 --> 00:05:36,044
[SPEAKER_17]: So I thank her for all the work that she's done.

80
00:05:36,445 --> 00:05:42,310
[SPEAKER_17]: As Councilor Caraviello said, the chamber couldn't have picked a better selection this year, and I congratulate her.

81
00:05:43,431 --> 00:05:43,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

82
00:05:44,231 --> 00:05:48,615
[SPEAKER_03]: So on the motion of Councilor Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

87
00:05:56,512 --> 00:05:58,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Bears, Vice President Bears, how did you find the records?

88
00:05:58,973 --> 00:06:01,354
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Madam President, I found the records in order and I move approval.

89
00:06:02,154 --> 00:06:04,635
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion of Vice President Bears, seconded by Councilor Knight.

95
00:06:11,557 --> 00:06:14,778
[SPEAKER_03]: This was a Committee of the Whole on updating the food trucks ordinance.

96
00:06:15,418 --> 00:06:21,000
[SPEAKER_03]: We had some back and forth, some motions made and some adjustments made as far as I think a lot of

97
00:06:22,067 --> 00:06:27,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, if anyone wants to add anything more to that, it's something that remains in committee, I believe.

98
00:06:27,912 --> 00:06:28,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Continue to work on that.

99
00:06:32,015 --> 00:06:35,858

[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Madam President.

107
00:06:46,686 --> 00:06:49,228
[SPEAKER_13]: This was regarding the proposed Waste Hauler Ordinance.

108
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,141
[SPEAKER_13]: We reviewed that in subcommittee.

109
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:55,844
[SPEAKER_13]: We also reviewed the existing ordinances around recycling.

110
00:06:56,945 --> 00:07:17,260
[SPEAKER_13]: Per that review, we've gone back to Commissioner McGivern and Director Hunt for further comment, and we'll hopefully have another subcommittee meeting on that in the next few weeks to pass, or at least send to a committee of the whole, an updated draft of that ordinance that better fits with what we have in the city ordinances now and what we need out of that.

111
00:07:17,841 --> 00:07:19,302
[SPEAKER_13]: We're also working with Director O'Connor.

112

[SPEAKER_03]: 19-070 March 8th.

117
00:07:31,216 --> 00:07:33,338
[SPEAKER_03]: This was on the proposed trees ordinance.

118
00:07:33,418 --> 00:07:39,603
[SPEAKER_03]: We looked at an ordinance that was split into three parts with the tree committee, the public shade trees and the private trees.

119
00:07:40,203 --> 00:07:44,706
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the biggest thing is we had some minor edits to the public and the trees on the

120
00:07:46,273 --> 00:07:58,697
[SPEAKER_03]: tree committee establishment, and then we actually, Building Commissioner Forty is gonna give us a red line or updated draft of the private trees ordinance to see what we can do within either zoning and permitting and things like that.

121
00:08:00,218 --> 00:08:01,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I have a motion?

122
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:04,500
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion of Councilor Collins to approve, seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

126
00:08:07,761 --> 00:08:12,082
[SPEAKER_03]: 22-514, March 15th, Committee of the Whole, report to follow.

127
00:08:12,622 --> 00:08:13,963
[SPEAKER_03]: This was outdoor dining.

128
00:08:14,604 --> 00:08:16,084
[SPEAKER_03]: We had some good back and forth about that.

129
00:08:16,324 --> 00:08:19,345
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a lot of it just related to safety and just finalizing it.

130
00:08:19,525 --> 00:08:21,686
[SPEAKER_03]: And we report that out of committee with amendments.

131
00:08:21,726 --> 00:08:23,126
[SPEAKER_03]: So that should be on a future agenda.

132
00:08:24,486 --> 00:08:27,847
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion of Councilor Garbiel to approve, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

00:08:27,887 --> 00:08:28,467
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

134
00:08:28,487 --> 00:08:29,847
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

135
00:08:29,887 --> 00:08:30,527
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

136
00:08:30,847 --> 00:08:31,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

137
00:08:31,368 --> 00:08:32,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Motions, orders, and resolutions.

138
00:08:32,588 --> 00:08:35,388
[SPEAKER_03]: 23-065 offered by Councilor Knight.

139
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:41,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it so resolved that the city administration provide a dollar for dollar breakdown and explanation of all ARPA expenditures to date.

140
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:42,950
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight.

141
00:08:43,817 --> 00:08:44,938
[SPEAKER_17]: Madam President, thank you very much.

142
00:08:45,118 --> 00:08:50,422
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, this is a request for the administration to provide us with a dollar for dollar breakdown relative to all upper expenditures to date.

143
00:08:51,043 --> 00:08:57,348
[SPEAKER_17]: It's been brought to my attention that there was some concerns relative to the way that our funds are being expended.

144
00:08:57,728 --> 00:09:10,599
[SPEAKER_17]: When we had our previous federal funds manager in place and that's my understanding that there's some litigation that's going on relative to the separation of the prior federal funds manager in the city right now, related to some of the

145
00:09:11,863 --> 00:09:16,766
[SPEAKER_17]: directives that she had received and whether or not they fell within the compliance of the operative directives that were issued by the Feds.

146
00:09:17,446 --> 00:09:23,309
[SPEAKER_17]: So what I'm asking for is a dollar for dollar breakdown to be sure that the money is being spent in accord with the federal requirements, Madam President.

147
00:09:23,909 --> 00:09:26,110
[SPEAKER_17]: Ultimately, there are certain places that money can't be spent.

148
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,351
[SPEAKER_17]: For example, it can't be spent for legal services.

149
00:09:29,051 --> 00:09:31,633
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'd just like to be sure that the money is being spent where it's supposed to be spent.

150
00:09:31,773 --> 00:09:32,793
[SPEAKER_17]: It was a lot of money.

151
00:09:32,813 --> 00:09:33,513
[SPEAKER_17]: We spent a lot of it.

152
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:36,215
[SPEAKER_17]: It seems like the man wants to spend a lot more of it this evening.

153
00:09:36,795 --> 00:09:40,837
[SPEAKER_17]: So if that's the case, I want to be sure that we have a strong financial auditing and accounting of it.

154
00:09:42,087 --> 00:09:42,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

155
00:09:43,568 --> 00:09:44,189
[SPEAKER_03]: Further discussion?

156
00:09:46,151 --> 00:09:49,514
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

157
00:09:49,534 --> 00:09:50,135
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

158
00:09:50,155 --> 00:09:51,616
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

159
00:09:51,676 --> 00:09:52,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

160
00:09:52,317 --> 00:09:55,160
[SPEAKER_03]: 23-066 offered by Councilor Knight.

161
00:09:55,280 --> 00:10:00,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it so resolved that the Metro City Council request that the potholes on Lawrence Road between Lincoln Road and Governor's Ave be addressed.

162
00:10:01,223 --> 00:10:01,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight.

163
00:10:01,904 --> 00:10:02,964
[SPEAKER_17]: Madam President, thank you very much.

164
00:10:03,124 --> 00:10:04,545
[SPEAKER_17]: These aren't the run-of-the-mill portals.

165
00:10:05,286 --> 00:10:08,148
[SPEAKER_17]: These, I think Mike, if you fell into it, you'd end up in Australia.

166
00:10:08,468 --> 00:10:10,189
[SPEAKER_17]: These are the deepest portals I've ever seen in my life.

167
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:15,573
[SPEAKER_17]: They're definitely something that could damage public safety vehicles, ambulances, police cars, fire engines, and the like.

168
00:10:16,734 --> 00:10:22,358
[SPEAKER_17]: We've seen tonight that we already have a request from the administration to spend some money to purchase some new public safety vehicles.

169
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:26,061
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think it would be safe to say that the conditions of our roadway have an impact.

170
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:27,991
[SPEAKER_17]: on the wear and tear of the vehicles.

171
00:10:28,431 --> 00:10:38,398
[SPEAKER_17]: These departments operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year, and the conditions of our roads have a direct impact on the quality of our vehicles and the longevity of their routes.

172
00:10:38,418 --> 00:10:42,921
[SPEAKER_17]: So with that being said, Madam President, I ask that the administration go down there in the interest of public safety and take care of these puddles.

173
00:10:43,802 --> 00:10:44,482
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

174
00:10:45,303 --> 00:10:46,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Further discussion?

175
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:50,966
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

176
00:10:50,986 --> 00:10:51,587
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

177
00:10:52,438 --> 00:10:55,180
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed, motion passes.

178
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,382
[SPEAKER_03]: 23-067 offered by Councilor Knight, be it so resolved that the illegal dumping on Doonan Street be addressed by the city administration.

179
00:11:00,462 --> 00:11:00,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight.

180
00:11:01,103 --> 00:11:02,424
[SPEAKER_17]: Madam President, thank you very much.

181
00:11:02,444 --> 00:11:06,126
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, on Doonan Street, a washing machine, looks like a living room set, bed.

182
00:11:06,846 --> 00:11:10,788
[SPEAKER_17]: We're all spread out between those, say number 16 in the corner of Highland Ave.

183
00:11:10,868 --> 00:11:17,892
[SPEAKER_17]: So when you take a look at what's transpired, let's say around February 28th, this was reported through C-Click Fix.

184
00:11:18,652 --> 00:11:21,434
[SPEAKER_17]: Around March 7th, it was acknowledged by the administration.

185
00:11:22,133 --> 00:11:31,720
[SPEAKER_17]: And to date, as recently as two days ago, the resident has said that those materials still lie outside their home.

186
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,242
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm hoping the administration will get on this as promptly as possible.

187
00:11:34,762 --> 00:11:35,863
[SPEAKER_17]: This is an illegal dumping issue.

188
00:11:35,943 --> 00:11:46,150
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not something that's uncommon throughout our community, especially on roadways that abut state-owned and controlled roads, especially on properties that are French properties on the Metro Malden line as well, and that's some of the line.

189
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:49,172
[SPEAKER_17]: So with that being said, I'd ask that the administration take the necessary steps to address it.

190
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Any further discussion?

191
00:11:53,682 --> 00:11:56,844
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion of Councilor Knights, seconded by Vice President Bears.

192
00:11:56,864 --> 00:11:57,564
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

193
00:11:58,365 --> 00:11:59,185
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

194
00:11:59,205 --> 00:11:59,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

195
00:11:59,906 --> 00:12:03,688
[SPEAKER_03]: 23-068 offered by President Morell and Vice President Bears.

196
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:11,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the council leadership and city clerk implement new agenda and meeting management software for council agendas, documents, and meetings.

197
00:12:11,693 --> 00:12:12,974
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Bears, I'll let you take it away.

198
00:12:13,755 --> 00:12:14,715
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Madam President.

199
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:20,099
[SPEAKER_13]: So something that council leadership, President Morell and I have been looking at

200
00:12:20,509 --> 00:12:27,056
[SPEAKER_13]: with the city clerk over the past few months, going back to last fall is the meeting and agenda management software right now.

201
00:12:28,292 --> 00:12:33,496
[SPEAKER_13]: We had the system from IQM2 that was installed in 207 and 201.

202
00:12:34,077 --> 00:12:39,041
[SPEAKER_13]: That system is not really being used, obviously, since the pandemic.

203
00:12:39,161 --> 00:12:43,585
[SPEAKER_13]: We were still signed up for a contract up until last fall that was costing some funds.

204
00:12:44,486 --> 00:12:56,816
[SPEAKER_13]: And given the hybrid meetings that are now in our rules, given the setup of this chamber, given that Medford Community Media and the city administration have said that both 201 and 207 should also, at least at some point, be made

205
00:12:57,404 --> 00:12:58,765
[SPEAKER_13]: available for those hybrid meetings.

206
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,407
[SPEAKER_13]: That software really was deprecated.

207
00:13:01,427 --> 00:13:02,808
[SPEAKER_13]: It was not useful software.

208
00:13:02,828 --> 00:13:06,430
[SPEAKER_13]: The camera technology is not compatible with the hybrid meetings that we use now, et cetera.

209
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:11,714
[SPEAKER_13]: In addition, it just is not great agenda software in terms of accessing information.

210
00:13:12,654 --> 00:13:18,758
[SPEAKER_13]: So given that we weren't using it, hadn't used it for multiple years, we moved away from that system.

211
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:22,621
[SPEAKER_13]: The clerk and myself and the president have been looking at

212
00:13:23,395 --> 00:13:26,157
[SPEAKER_13]: other potential meeting and agenda management systems.

213
00:13:26,677 --> 00:13:34,542
[SPEAKER_13]: And we ended up finding that the company, the vendor that provides MuniCode also provides a system called Civic Clerk.

214
00:13:35,143 --> 00:13:57,830
[SPEAKER_13]: which will allow for agenda and meeting management software to be significantly improved, to have all packet materials and agendas provided through the system, you can track resolutions through the system, as well as it, you can even use it during the meetings itself to put up information on the on the screen and directly connect your agenda and documents into your meeting.

215
00:13:59,491 --> 00:14:03,794
[SPEAKER_13]: that's actually going to cost less than half of what the prior software was costing.

216
00:14:04,454 --> 00:14:18,163
[SPEAKER_13]: So really, just implementing this is going to streamline a bunch of different work that the clerk's office does right now, you know, in spreadsheets or on Word documents or in agenda postings on the city website into one software service.

217
00:14:18,603 --> 00:14:26,008
[SPEAKER_13]: And part of what we've looked at also includes the training necessary so that all people involved will have the training they need to get up to speed on the software.

218
00:14:27,028 --> 00:14:27,709
[SPEAKER_13]: So it is a

219
00:14:28,336 --> 00:14:41,001
[SPEAKER_13]: will be a real improvement, I believe, for the clerk's office, although I wouldn't ask the clerk to speak to it, but in our conversations, he's been really excited and thinking that it will really improve the workflow on this meeting and agenda work in his office.

220
00:14:41,342 --> 00:14:43,923
[SPEAKER_13]: And he's nodding yes for those who can't see.

221
00:14:45,183 --> 00:14:52,726
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's less than what we're spending now, and it's already in the budget because it was a software, it's replacing a software that we were using in the past that we haven't used since 2020.

222
00:14:53,247 --> 00:14:56,028
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's my general summary and happy to

223
00:14:57,074 --> 00:14:59,456
[SPEAKER_13]: answer any questions having been in the process.

224
00:15:00,616 --> 00:15:01,897
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for that summary, Vice President Ferris.

225
00:15:01,937 --> 00:15:12,964
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, just to build on what you said is it's it's a tool for the council, but it's really a tool for the public to make sure that they can access, you know, the same things we're getting physically every week that they can track resolutions, they can have better following of all the work that's being done.

226
00:15:14,185 --> 00:15:14,665
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Tseng.

227
00:15:15,366 --> 00:15:16,146
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, President Merle.

228
00:15:16,366 --> 00:15:17,207
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, it sounds like

229
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:25,091
[SPEAKER_12]: This would be super helpful for increasing transparency and civic participation in terms of city council meetings I know a lot of residents.

230
00:15:25,972 --> 00:15:36,922
[SPEAKER_12]: After you know contentious debates or big meetings that we have they do ask for some of the meeting materials or presentations that we see on the screen and, you know, a lot of that work we have to do separately but if we could

231
00:15:37,522 --> 00:15:49,332
[SPEAKER_12]: it sounds like if it's integrated into the meeting software, it'd be easier for them to kind of get involved in the materials that we're working with and see the debates that we're having from our perspective as well.

232
00:15:49,912 --> 00:15:57,959
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's something that oftentimes, because it's harder to get, it's not as easy to get access to some of the materials.

233
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,741
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't see the whole debate.

234
00:16:00,881 --> 00:16:05,265
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think it'd be more fruitful for our discussions for everyone to be able to participate fully.

235
00:16:06,426 --> 00:16:09,629
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm also glad to hear that we found an option that saves money.

236
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:27,146
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think it's pretty straightforward that if we have something, if we have options that are more efficient and saves money, I think that's a pretty decent investment for us to make to bring our city processes into more contemporary, more modern process.

237
00:16:27,806 --> 00:16:28,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

238
00:16:29,528 --> 00:16:30,089
[SPEAKER_03]: President Bears.

239
00:16:30,718 --> 00:16:32,219
[SPEAKER_13]: just two other quick things that I forgot.

240
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,042
[SPEAKER_13]: This is also going to integrate directly with Muni code.

241
00:16:35,182 --> 00:16:41,968
[SPEAKER_13]: So meeting records and documentation will seamlessly move forward instead of having to go through an upload process and all of that burden.

242
00:16:42,549 --> 00:16:49,475
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's the least as far as I know, and we'll see through the implementation process, it may be possible for other boards and commissions to use the software as well.

243
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:54,019
[SPEAKER_13]: So you'd be able to access other public meeting information and agendas through this as well.

244
00:16:54,059 --> 00:16:54,460
[SPEAKER_13]: But that's

245
00:16:55,045 --> 00:17:04,248
[SPEAKER_13]: We're focusing on the council first, but hopefully if possible, and it's just already built in, then maybe we can make it available to boards and commissions as well.

246
00:17:04,588 --> 00:17:06,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other discussion from the council?

247
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:10,310
[SPEAKER_03]: I do see a motion for approval by councilor.

248
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:11,190
[SPEAKER_03]: I do see one hand up.

249
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:14,271
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually don't have co-hosting privileges.

250
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:15,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you wanna?

251
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:25,899
[SPEAKER_03]: for the record, please.

252
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,020
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you hear me?

253
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:29,721
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

254
00:17:29,741 --> 00:17:31,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Name and address for the record, please.

255
00:17:31,182 --> 00:17:33,223
[SPEAKER_01]: Eunice Brown, Greenleaf Ave.

256
00:17:33,263 --> 00:17:34,404
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a quick question on this.

257
00:17:34,444 --> 00:17:35,704
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is a great idea.

258
00:17:35,724 --> 00:17:46,490
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this something that your friends over in the school committee will be able to partake in as well and use for their meetings and agendas and packets and such?

259
00:17:51,332 --> 00:17:53,734
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, potentially, I don't know.

260
00:17:55,823 --> 00:18:09,007
[SPEAKER_13]: we're gonna try to get the software implemented for the council and see what kind of availability is there, but also I think it would be up to them and to any board and commission if they wanna stick with what they're using now or the process that they have now versus using this software or not.

261
00:18:09,667 --> 00:18:10,907
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, it's coming out of our budget.

262
00:18:11,267 --> 00:18:15,088
[SPEAKER_13]: And it is coming out of, is it technically coming out of the clerk's budget or the council budget?

263
00:18:15,308 --> 00:18:19,349
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's coming out of the clerk's budget.

264
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:19,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

265
00:18:19,529 --> 00:18:20,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thank you.

266
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:20,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Any further discussion?

267
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:24,591
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by...

268
00:18:25,566 --> 00:18:26,786
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Tseng all those in favor.

269
00:18:27,547 --> 00:18:28,267
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed.

270
00:18:28,327 --> 00:18:32,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

271
00:18:32,068 --> 00:18:33,488
[SPEAKER_03]: 23-069 offered by vice president bears.

272
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:41,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it resolved that the Medford city council expresses its support of HD 577 and SD 1144 and act relative to pesticides.

273
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:49,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it further resolved that the city council that a city clerk for a copy of this resolution to the Medford legislative delegation as well as house speaker Mariano

274
00:18:49,822 --> 00:18:51,063
[SPEAKER_03]: and Senate President Spilka.

275
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:52,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Bears.

276
00:18:52,343 --> 00:18:53,303
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Madam President.

277
00:18:53,884 --> 00:19:01,987
[SPEAKER_13]: I think as folks know, a few weeks ago, one of the bald eagles at Mystic Lakes died because it was poisoned.

278
00:19:02,747 --> 00:19:07,009
[SPEAKER_13]: And these were the pesticides that killed that bald eagle.

279
00:19:07,409 --> 00:19:15,552
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know a lot of folks were obviously distraught about that specific case, but it's not, you know, this is a statewide issue.

280
00:19:15,632 --> 00:19:16,753
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why there's a statewide bill.

281
00:19:16,793 --> 00:19:17,673
[SPEAKER_13]: It's also a state law

282
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:19,168
[SPEAKER_13]: regulates this.

283
00:19:19,228 --> 00:19:23,229
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's not like Medford can say, we won't let you use this type of pesticide here.

284
00:19:23,249 --> 00:19:24,630
[SPEAKER_13]: It really has to happen through the state.

285
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:39,093
[SPEAKER_13]: One person who I communicated with a little bit about this was our animal control officer, Pat Hogan, who was especially distraught at this happening and losing such an amazing animal to something like this.

286
00:19:39,714 --> 00:19:44,795
[SPEAKER_13]: Basically what happened is a rat ate some rodenticide and it

287
00:19:45,506 --> 00:19:47,208
[SPEAKER_13]: The eagle ate the rat and the eagle died.

288
00:19:48,469 --> 00:20:03,847
[SPEAKER_13]: And there are alternatives that are not this kind of anti-coagulant as far as I understand, no expert, but alternatives to this option that are not going to cause such detrimental impacts up the food chain when we're talking about rat control and rodent control.

289
00:20:05,276 --> 00:20:08,277
[SPEAKER_13]: So he was one person I talked to, I said, hey, I'll put a resolution on it.

290
00:20:08,297 --> 00:20:14,640
[SPEAKER_13]: And he said, thanks, because he had put out a call asking people to call their lawmakers about this bill.

291
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:29,887
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's several other folks from many communities who've had incidents like the one that we had, who are also hoping that this law will change and that this will not be something that our animal control and other folks have to deal with on a regular basis anymore.

292
00:20:30,067 --> 00:20:31,127
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's the intent here.

293
00:20:31,167 --> 00:20:33,148
[SPEAKER_13]: And I ask my colleagues for their support.

294
00:20:33,688 --> 00:20:33,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

295
00:20:36,465 --> 00:20:39,686
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, President Morell, and thank you, Vice President Bears, for putting this on the agenda tonight.

296
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:49,930
[SPEAKER_14]: I too received a lot of messages from constituents after this very sad passing of a very beloved local bald eagle passed several weeks ago.

297
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:58,634
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think this is a problem that can really only be appropriately addressed regionally, not only because cities kind of can't

298
00:20:59,543 --> 00:21:02,485
[SPEAKER_14]: address the issue of what rodenticides are being used on a piecemeal basis.

299
00:21:02,525 --> 00:21:07,567
[SPEAKER_14]: We can't, you know, influence what private individuals are using.

300
00:21:07,707 --> 00:21:19,174
[SPEAKER_14]: But also, you know, I think a statewide regional approach is what's going to make these less harmful approaches cost effective for places like municipalities and institutions to implement, so that we can make sure that what we're putting into the

301
00:21:20,347 --> 00:21:26,271
[SPEAKER_14]: into our food chain, into our ecosystem is preserving the biodiversity such that we have along the mystic that I think we all really care so much about.

302
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:28,232
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'll be happy to support this this evening.

303
00:21:28,292 --> 00:21:30,234
[SPEAKER_14]: And I really hope that this advances on the state level.

304
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:30,674
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

305
00:21:31,114 --> 00:21:31,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

306
00:21:32,929 --> 00:21:33,149
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks.

307
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:36,212
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, thank you, Vice President Bears for putting this on agenda.

308
00:21:37,013 --> 00:21:42,579
[SPEAKER_12]: I think I would like to reiterate the local effect of, of something like this.

309
00:21:43,019 --> 00:21:44,221
[SPEAKER_12]: When we think about rodenticides.

310
00:21:44,821 --> 00:21:50,487
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, you know, we have the anecdote of the beautiful bald eagle, unfortunately passing away from them.

311
00:21:51,889 --> 00:22:03,984
[SPEAKER_12]: I know pet owners, especially cat owners, are concerned about their cats going out there and eating rats or catching mice that have swallowed this, you know, right on the side.

312
00:22:04,204 --> 00:22:05,185
[SPEAKER_12]: This is something that I think

313
00:22:06,165 --> 00:22:09,206
[SPEAKER_12]: residents at the local level should be concerned about.

314
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:13,927
[SPEAKER_12]: And I've also received a good number of messages from constituents about this issue.

315
00:22:14,488 --> 00:22:22,490
[SPEAKER_12]: It's also important to underscore, I think this council very much recognizes that there's a rodent problem in the area.

316
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:30,012
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a regional problem, but there are other alternatives out there that are just as useful and less harmful.

317
00:22:30,252 --> 00:22:35,254
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think we all have to step up, but in terms of spreading out

318
00:22:35,878 --> 00:22:40,421
[SPEAKER_12]: a public education campaign about how we tackle this problem.

319
00:22:41,722 --> 00:22:47,686
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think this is a good step from the state level that we should support because it has true local effects.

320
00:22:48,507 --> 00:22:48,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

321
00:22:49,688 --> 00:22:50,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Any further discussion from the council?

322
00:22:50,848 --> 00:22:51,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight.

323
00:22:51,629 --> 00:23:02,677
[SPEAKER_17]: Madam President, I just ask that on a second, a side note or a side motion that this paper be sent to a director of the Board of Health to see what impact if this paper is passed at the state level,

324
00:23:04,027 --> 00:23:15,775
[SPEAKER_17]: what impact it will have on our road and control ordinance here in the city of Medford, and whether or not we can take the steps that are raised in this ordinance at the local level, because that's really what we are as local officials, not state officials.

325
00:23:16,016 --> 00:23:21,119
[SPEAKER_17]: We all know how I feel about sending this stuff up to the state house if they're not gonna give us money, or we're not asking for money.

326
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:27,483
[SPEAKER_17]: But with that being said, if we could send it to our Director of the Board of Health, so that they could review our existing ordinance to see how that complies.

327
00:23:28,204 --> 00:23:28,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

328
00:23:29,264 --> 00:23:29,885
[SPEAKER_03]: Any further discussion?

329
00:23:32,122 --> 00:23:35,845
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion of Vice President Bears, seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

330
00:23:35,865 --> 00:23:36,485
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

331
00:23:37,226 --> 00:23:37,886
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

332
00:23:37,926 --> 00:23:38,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

333
00:23:38,567 --> 00:23:41,449
[SPEAKER_03]: 23-070 offered by Councilor Caraviello.

334
00:23:41,569 --> 00:23:46,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council again request funding for legal counsel to complete the zoning process in Medford.

335
00:23:46,132 --> 00:23:46,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Caraviello.

336
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:48,734
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Madam President.

337
00:23:48,754 --> 00:23:53,717
[SPEAKER_09]: So this council worked two and a half years recodifying zoning laws.

338
00:23:54,198 --> 00:23:58,701
[SPEAKER_09]: And now a year has gone by and we've done nothing.

339
00:23:59,883 --> 00:24:05,507
[SPEAKER_09]: We're on the verge of hopefully passing our first project under the new zoning.

340
00:24:06,588 --> 00:24:22,419
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think at this time, I'm looking to move forward and actually bringing back Cheney Borbowsky to actually help us do the actual zoning process, which is really the most important part of this issue here.

341
00:24:22,519 --> 00:24:22,980
[SPEAKER_09]: He's done it.

342
00:24:24,348 --> 00:24:35,111
[SPEAKER_09]: hundreds of cities and towns across the state, and I'd like to bring it back so we can get the final chapter of this done, so we can move forward with some development in the city.

343
00:24:36,011 --> 00:24:36,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

344
00:24:36,651 --> 00:24:51,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, and as we discussed, just to provide an update, I've been working with, as well as Vice President Bears, with Director Hunt, just because to do the zoning work we want to do, I think we discussed that we need a land use planner as well, so then that kicks us into the

345
00:24:51,962 --> 00:24:53,403
[SPEAKER_03]: bidding the RFP process.

346
00:24:53,423 --> 00:24:56,945
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just, we're refining the scope with Director Hunt and her staff.

347
00:24:57,586 --> 00:25:02,389
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope to have that to the council by end of the week, maybe next week.

348
00:25:02,429 --> 00:25:05,891
[SPEAKER_03]: And then once we agree on that scope, we can start that process and get that moving.

349
00:25:05,991 --> 00:25:12,476
[SPEAKER_03]: And I did get it affirmed by Director Hunt that we, the $50,000 is in the budget again for next year.

350
00:25:12,896 --> 00:25:14,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Ideally we can use, you know, the whole 50,000

351
00:25:16,058 --> 00:25:22,823
[SPEAKER_03]: We can get the whole 50,000 done, or at least some of it this fiscal year, we'll also get the 50,000 next year and Dr. Hunt did mention it's going to be enough.

352
00:25:23,323 --> 00:25:26,566
[SPEAKER_03]: She did mention there will be money coming from her budget as well to support the work.

353
00:25:26,866 --> 00:25:42,738
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's just my update on that counter night, Madam President, I was wondering why it's taken 10 months since the mayor sat up here and told us that we were going to be able to get an assistant city solicitor and continue our zoning work but I think you answered the question it's been time Alicia is involved so of course it's going to be 10 months.

354
00:25:43,258 --> 00:25:46,779
[SPEAKER_17]: Right, but ultimately the zoning falls under the purview of the city council.

355
00:25:47,499 --> 00:25:52,361
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, and this is something we requested 10 months ago, and this was part of the deal that we made we negotiated settlement of the budget.

356
00:25:52,981 --> 00:26:00,583
[SPEAKER_17]: So here we are now with two months left in the fiscal year, right two I'm sorry two months left in the calendar year and 10 months ago we made this deal, and we still move forward.

357
00:26:01,384 --> 00:26:02,924
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, so it's just another indicator.

358
00:26:03,368 --> 00:26:09,352
[SPEAKER_17]: that the administration is not going to cooperate with city council just another indicated the administration is not willing to provide us with the tools that we need to succeed.

359
00:26:09,852 --> 00:26:13,134
[SPEAKER_17]: The administration needs the hand and everything they need to control everything that's going on.

360
00:26:14,195 --> 00:26:14,455
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

361
00:26:15,456 --> 00:26:20,459
[SPEAKER_17]: I can't believe that we were able to get the zoning actually I can't believe it you know why because it was under the prior administration.

362
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:24,962
[SPEAKER_17]: That's why we're able to get the zoning completed that we got completed because the process started under a prior administration.

363
00:26:25,332 --> 00:26:29,173
[SPEAKER_17]: Under this administration, we have not been given any transparency or any of the things that we have promised.

364
00:26:29,613 --> 00:26:33,214
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's ridiculous that Councilor Caraviello needs to bring this up now, 10 months after the budget.

365
00:26:34,014 --> 00:26:38,335
[SPEAKER_17]: As we sit here and we wait, we twiddle our thumbs and say, when can we get to work on the issues that really matter to this community?

366
00:26:38,835 --> 00:26:41,475
[SPEAKER_17]: On the issues that are gonna generate revenue, right?

367
00:26:41,535 --> 00:26:45,796
[SPEAKER_17]: On the issues that are gonna create jobs and on the issues that are gonna be the bridge to our future.

368
00:26:48,157 --> 00:26:49,297
[SPEAKER_17]: I thank the gentleman for bringing it up.

369
00:26:50,753 --> 00:26:51,293
[SPEAKER_03]: President Bears.

370
00:26:51,794 --> 00:26:52,754
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Madam President.

371
00:26:52,814 --> 00:26:58,297
[SPEAKER_13]: And certainly I share the idea that this should have happened sooner.

372
00:26:58,317 --> 00:27:01,539
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to on my own own a piece of the delay.

373
00:27:01,699 --> 00:27:08,943
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I think we met last on zoning on the on the scriveners errors, the zoning changes suggestions from the building commissioner.

374
00:27:08,963 --> 00:27:10,584
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that was in December.

375
00:27:10,604 --> 00:27:16,227
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, my hope was that we would have the scope not at the end of March, but maybe the end of January.

376
00:27:16,248 --> 00:27:16,288
[SPEAKER_13]: Um,

377
00:27:17,583 --> 00:27:22,289
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, we have made some progress since we did the last zoning I hear what you're saying about the frustration.

378
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:29,778
[SPEAKER_13]: I also want to say that I do feel like we're on a good path to getting a good scope and RFP for us to look at discuss vote on and get out the door so that we can

379
00:27:30,365 --> 00:27:31,186
[SPEAKER_13]: work on the process.

380
00:27:31,226 --> 00:27:33,947
[SPEAKER_13]: And part of that, I was involved in that process as well.

381
00:27:33,987 --> 00:27:41,232
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's, and you know, I have had, you know, been looking at Draftscope and it's taken me a couple of weeks longer than I thought to send back suggestions.

382
00:27:41,272 --> 00:27:43,914
[SPEAKER_13]: So I may be part of the delay and I want to own a piece of that.

383
00:27:44,194 --> 00:27:45,555
[SPEAKER_17]: But to that point, right?

384
00:27:46,075 --> 00:27:48,957
[SPEAKER_17]: Why is it growing into something that needs to go to the RFP process, right?

385
00:27:48,997 --> 00:27:51,839
[SPEAKER_17]: When it's legal contract, it's legal services contract, doesn't need to go out to bid.

386
00:27:51,859 --> 00:27:53,960
[SPEAKER_17]: We know we want Mike Wabrowski.

387
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,541
[SPEAKER_17]: Now we're going down this road, right?

388
00:27:55,561 --> 00:27:57,562
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going down this road because they're trying to grab a job out of it.

389
00:27:57,582 --> 00:27:58,863
[SPEAKER_17]: They're trying to create a new position out of it.

390
00:28:00,344 --> 00:28:16,684
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe at council meetings we discussed that we need a land use a lot of things to do a deeper, but to do a deeper dive into the zoning we need a land use planner to come with and that kicks it then it's not just legal and it's not just that part and it kicks off the bid process, and we've had

391
00:28:17,132 --> 00:28:23,014
[SPEAKER_13]: if I may, Madam President, we've had some conversations with Mark Brodsky and him saying, here are the pieces of this that I can do.

392
00:28:23,094 --> 00:28:25,014
[SPEAKER_13]: And here are the pieces where you need additional support.

393
00:28:25,294 --> 00:28:25,854
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm a lawyer.

394
00:28:26,595 --> 00:28:27,195
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's the zoning.

395
00:28:27,255 --> 00:28:31,376
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's the pieces of part, you know, there's a lot of the record and the actual legal language.

396
00:28:31,416 --> 00:28:32,516
[SPEAKER_13]: That's my expertise.

397
00:28:33,056 --> 00:28:35,237
[SPEAKER_13]: He mentioned that he's brought on some other folks.

398
00:28:35,257 --> 00:28:38,478
[SPEAKER_13]: I think Jonathan Silverstein now works at a part of his firm.

399
00:28:39,118 --> 00:28:40,498
[SPEAKER_13]: And he said, but here's the pieces of this.

400
00:28:40,598 --> 00:28:42,879
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, you know, he's not going to run public meetings for us to

401
00:28:43,467 --> 00:28:49,310
[SPEAKER_13]: discuss, you know, potential zoning changes with the public, he's not going to work with the Community Development Board or Zoning Board.

402
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:52,872
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, there's pieces of this that he said, like it's it needs to be a partnership.

403
00:28:52,892 --> 00:29:02,838
[SPEAKER_13]: And if I just want to add this, and, you know, when when we brought on Brabowski in 2020, in the end of 2020, I think it was, or I can't quite remember.

404
00:29:03,618 --> 00:29:07,380
[SPEAKER_13]: But in 2020, or 2021, he initially submitted as part of a group

405
00:29:08,017 --> 00:29:17,579
[SPEAKER_13]: We got a response to an RFP where he was part of a group working, I think, with a land use consultant and a planning consultant and him as part of a three-pronged package.

406
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:21,499
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we looked at the RFP and said, hey, we want to split this out.

407
00:29:21,579 --> 00:29:30,641
[SPEAKER_13]: And we understand you submitted as part of a group, but we want to split it out and do this RECOD part first, which we can just do as a legal contract just with you.

408
00:29:31,001 --> 00:29:35,482
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the phase two is going to be this larger question of where you have a planner and you have

409
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:42,993
[SPEAKER_13]: land use experts who are willing to help with the public process as well so I understand the frustration, I wish it had happened sooner.

410
00:29:44,394 --> 00:29:51,057
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I made the motion Madam President, I made the motion for us to go down the coast of reclassification and not rezoning.

411
00:29:51,697 --> 00:29:56,560
[SPEAKER_17]: I did it and I made the motion and I believe the motion said as phase one of a two part project and that was then.

412
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,361
[SPEAKER_17]: Right, right.

413
00:29:58,601 --> 00:29:59,041
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly.

414
00:29:59,461 --> 00:30:02,643
[SPEAKER_17]: So what I'm saying is what the heck, what's going on with this administration.

415
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:07,506
[SPEAKER_17]: What is going on in the time that they've been elected, they haven't had a full staff of senior officials.

416
00:30:09,447 --> 00:30:11,708
[SPEAKER_17]: And over three years, they haven't had a full complement of senior staff.

417
00:30:13,229 --> 00:30:15,010
[SPEAKER_09]: And because of that, we can't move as a community.

418
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:20,474
[SPEAKER_13]: That's definitely a piece of it.

419
00:30:20,654 --> 00:30:21,895
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to own my piece of it.

420
00:30:22,275 --> 00:30:22,495
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

421
00:30:22,595 --> 00:30:23,035
[SPEAKER_03]: And I will.

422
00:30:23,376 --> 00:30:27,438
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I will say Director Hunt is putting all of our staff on this right now.

423
00:30:27,498 --> 00:30:28,799
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think to your point, Councilor Knight,

424
00:30:29,743 --> 00:30:33,324
[SPEAKER_03]: we're asking her to do the work that an assistant city solicitor would have helped us with.

425
00:30:33,444 --> 00:30:36,504
[SPEAKER_03]: So I understand that maybe it's not moving as fast as any of us.

426
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,644
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not asking her to do it.

427
00:30:38,004 --> 00:30:38,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

428
00:30:38,645 --> 00:30:41,885
[SPEAKER_17]: But I'm asking the assistant city solicitor that the mayor said she was gonna hire to do it.

429
00:30:42,145 --> 00:30:43,725
[SPEAKER_17]: And she said she was gonna do that in June.

430
00:30:43,846 --> 00:30:47,266
[SPEAKER_17]: And here we are in what, March now, we still wanna have the assistant city solicitor.

431
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:49,587
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not asking director Hunt to do anything.

432
00:30:52,407 --> 00:30:54,147
[SPEAKER_13]: We're trying to make it work, but I hear that.

433
00:30:57,148 --> 00:30:57,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Any further discussion?

434
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:04,849
[SPEAKER_03]: So on the motion of Councilor Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Knight.

435
00:31:04,889 --> 00:31:05,449
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

436
00:31:05,469 --> 00:31:05,850
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

437
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:06,810
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

438
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:08,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

439
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:15,412
[SPEAKER_03]: 23-073 offered by vices and bears, be it resolved by the Metro City Council that the city administration present an update on the capital improvement plan.

440
00:31:15,912 --> 00:31:16,572
[SPEAKER_03]: Vices and bears.

441
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:17,612
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Madam President.

442
00:31:18,152 --> 00:31:22,013
[SPEAKER_13]: As we all know, there's been lots of conversations and discussion about a capital improvement plan.

443
00:31:23,354 --> 00:31:28,415
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we've heard at least in this council session recently, I think from members of the city staff that

444
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:31,191
[SPEAKER_13]: They're working on a capital improvement plan update.

445
00:31:31,631 --> 00:31:32,271
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd like to see it.

446
00:31:32,732 --> 00:31:36,753
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that we should be part of the process and I'm hoping we can see that sooner rather than later.

447
00:31:37,094 --> 00:31:38,094
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's my motion.

448
00:31:38,114 --> 00:31:39,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

449
00:31:40,775 --> 00:31:41,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you council.

450
00:31:41,676 --> 00:31:42,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, bring this forward.

451
00:31:42,476 --> 00:31:46,798
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, I think this is, this is an exercise for this council to understand what we're seeing.

452
00:31:47,518 --> 00:31:52,860
[SPEAKER_06]: We keep, the mayor keeps putting capital projects in front of us and we keep voting it.

453
00:31:52,981 --> 00:31:58,003
[SPEAKER_06]: At least I haven't, but we keep voting these different agendas, her agenda through.

454
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:00,033
[SPEAKER_06]: and we still haven't seen anything.

455
00:32:00,393 --> 00:32:02,514
[SPEAKER_06]: Truly haven't seen the finance piece yet.

456
00:32:02,755 --> 00:32:08,238
[SPEAKER_06]: Although the finance director was here, wasn't enough, at least in my opinion.

457
00:32:09,739 --> 00:32:15,583
[SPEAKER_06]: Second, we have papers in front of us today that should be in a capital improvement plan.

458
00:32:16,583 --> 00:32:20,986
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we're gonna vote for firetrucks tonight, is that part of the plan?

459
00:32:21,006 --> 00:32:22,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Or is that outside?

460
00:32:22,767 --> 00:32:25,529
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we just gonna start voting piece by piece by piece?

461
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:27,731
[SPEAKER_06]: So until this council,

462
00:32:28,683 --> 00:32:36,405
[SPEAKER_06]: stops with giving everything they want, we're gonna keep going down this road.

463
00:32:36,425 --> 00:32:41,226
[SPEAKER_06]: We're gonna keep going down this road because it's acceptable.

464
00:32:41,386 --> 00:32:44,666
[SPEAKER_06]: We're being treated like we don't count.

465
00:32:45,626 --> 00:32:48,307
[SPEAKER_06]: We're being treated with no respect.

466
00:32:49,647 --> 00:32:57,789
[SPEAKER_06]: But at the same time, this initiative is something that was brought up by a department head that talked about this capital improvement plan.

467
00:32:58,527 --> 00:33:05,895
[SPEAKER_06]: that when you're going to present it, we start the budget process when, but when should we start the budget process?

468
00:33:06,716 --> 00:33:09,839
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to do a budget process at the same time we're going to see a capital plan.

469
00:33:11,601 --> 00:33:12,482
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just distorted.

470
00:33:13,083 --> 00:33:14,124
[SPEAKER_06]: This isn't how you do business.

471
00:33:16,226 --> 00:33:19,790
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, though, thank you for bringing this forward because I do think it's very important.

472
00:33:21,052 --> 00:33:21,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Caraviello.

473
00:33:21,792 --> 00:33:22,592
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Madam President.

474
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:24,473
[SPEAKER_09]: And Councilor Scarpelli is right.

475
00:33:24,993 --> 00:33:28,074
[SPEAKER_09]: It's another, everything we do in this council is piecemeal.

476
00:33:30,254 --> 00:33:30,974
[SPEAKER_09]: There is no plan.

477
00:33:32,515 --> 00:33:36,415
[SPEAKER_09]: I would hope that when our budget comes forward, it isn't like the budget we had last year.

478
00:33:36,755 --> 00:33:39,976
[SPEAKER_09]: We were getting it the night before in another piecemeal project.

479
00:33:40,276 --> 00:33:42,417
[SPEAKER_09]: So again, capital plan should be done.

480
00:33:42,677 --> 00:33:47,758
[SPEAKER_09]: Listen, I'm not saying that the things that aren't there tonight aren't good things and they should be voted on.

481
00:33:48,935 --> 00:33:54,698
[SPEAKER_09]: But again, it's just part of the continual piecemeal, one at a time, one at a time project.

482
00:33:54,798 --> 00:33:57,040
[SPEAKER_09]: And say, and Councilor Scott is right.

483
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,522
[SPEAKER_09]: Shame on us for keep on voting on them and passing them.

484
00:34:01,802 --> 00:34:05,825
[SPEAKER_09]: So, but they are good projects, but should be presented all at once.

485
00:34:06,745 --> 00:34:08,926
[SPEAKER_09]: Not every other week or every two weeks getting something.

486
00:34:10,627 --> 00:34:10,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

487
00:34:11,288 --> 00:34:17,691
[SPEAKER_03]: And we do have a meeting, a Committee of the Whole meeting scheduled for next Wednesday for an update on the capital improvement plan based on-

488
00:34:26,883 --> 00:34:29,464
[SPEAKER_17]: If it's the first and the third, I'm good, but you know what I mean?

489
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:31,405
[SPEAKER_17]: Then if we're supposed to be off the second, you know what I mean?

490
00:34:31,425 --> 00:34:32,305
[SPEAKER_17]: I get some childcare issues.

491
00:34:32,325 --> 00:34:33,525
[SPEAKER_17]: I have a young family, you know what I mean?

492
00:34:33,545 --> 00:34:36,147
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm trying to do the best I can, but I can always come on Zoom.

493
00:34:36,167 --> 00:34:36,887
[SPEAKER_17]: So you know what I mean?

494
00:34:36,927 --> 00:34:38,227
[SPEAKER_17]: But Wednesday shouldn't be a problem.

495
00:34:40,809 --> 00:34:41,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Any further discussion from the council?

496
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:47,571
[SPEAKER_03]: So on the motion by Susan Bair, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

497
00:34:47,591 --> 00:34:48,172
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

498
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:49,832
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

499
00:34:49,872 --> 00:34:50,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

500
00:34:52,583 --> 00:35:12,230
[SPEAKER_03]: 23-074 offered by vice president bears be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we meet in committee of the whole to discuss options to increase transparency, accountability and democratic oversight in city government by providing the city council with greater authority over the budget process, allowing the direct hiring of staff to support the city council and requiring city council confirmation of city board and commission appointees, vice president bears.

501
00:35:13,273 --> 00:35:17,156
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I mean, it flows right from the last conversation.

502
00:35:17,176 --> 00:35:25,143
[SPEAKER_13]: Really what I intend with this proposal is that we've seen how the process is broken.

503
00:35:25,363 --> 00:35:30,207
[SPEAKER_13]: We've seen this question of feeling respected, feeling included within the process.

504
00:35:30,507 --> 00:35:39,314
[SPEAKER_13]: And we've seen over the past couple of years what it's taken for us to force the conversations that we need to have.

505
00:35:39,354 --> 00:35:40,555
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think any of us were

506
00:35:41,568 --> 00:35:48,916
[SPEAKER_13]: know, just barely four of us were comfortable with what happened in the last budget meeting last June, right?

507
00:35:49,176 --> 00:35:55,022
[SPEAKER_13]: And I respect my colleagues who didn't want to go down that path, because that's not how government should operate, right?

508
00:35:55,102 --> 00:35:56,403
[SPEAKER_13]: It should never have gotten to that point.

509
00:35:56,443 --> 00:35:58,125
[SPEAKER_13]: It should never have been 1.30 in the morning.

510
00:35:58,165 --> 00:35:58,906
[SPEAKER_13]: It should never have been

511
00:35:59,703 --> 00:36:15,227
[SPEAKER_13]: we have to say this is gonna be a cut or we won't approve or put us into a period of uncertainty because we didn't have the information that we needed, residents didn't have the information that we needed, and we didn't have the good faith collaborative process that quite frankly, the city deserves.

512
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:25,466
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is really calling the question, I mean, my thoughts here are, you know, I have thoughts I want to meet in committee of the whole to really outline what this would look like.

513
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:36,714
[SPEAKER_13]: But there's these are the big three things for me that really I think will hit on a lot of the complaints and frustrations that we have voiced right here in this meeting and that we've voiced pretty much every meeting because I think we all share them.

514
00:36:38,485 --> 00:36:41,011
[SPEAKER_13]: a budget process where the council actually has real authority.

515
00:36:42,213 --> 00:36:48,648
[SPEAKER_13]: Right now, we are the final vote, quote unquote, but all we can do is approve, reject or cut.

516
00:36:49,464 --> 00:36:55,406
[SPEAKER_13]: We can't adjust, we can't amend, we can't say, you know, we really think that this priority is essential and it needs to be funded.

517
00:36:55,446 --> 00:36:59,108
[SPEAKER_13]: And instead we were in the situation we were in where it was cutting some sort of deal.

518
00:36:59,128 --> 00:37:00,128
[SPEAKER_13]: That's not how it should be.

519
00:37:00,608 --> 00:37:03,569
[SPEAKER_13]: We should be able to say, hey, we need 50,000 for zoning.

520
00:37:03,629 --> 00:37:05,930
[SPEAKER_13]: We're amending the budget to put 50,000 for zoning.

521
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:07,631
[SPEAKER_13]: We need legal counsel.

522
00:37:08,091 --> 00:37:15,674
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, maybe we'll put that in the budget directly, you know, and quite frankly, other cities have this, other cities have implemented it recently.

523
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:28,121
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, it's not like we're, you know, the city council's going and moving around 10 2030% of the budget, it's still on the margins, it's still, you know, a few hundred thousand dollars and like less than 5%, or even less than 1% of a budget.

524
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,923
[SPEAKER_13]: But those priorities and really being heard.

525
00:37:31,503 --> 00:37:35,085
[SPEAKER_13]: If we want to, if we want to have that respect, we need that power.

526
00:37:35,225 --> 00:37:39,447
[SPEAKER_13]: And that, you know, means going through the discussion of what that what that would look like.

527
00:37:39,688 --> 00:37:43,730
[SPEAKER_13]: The two other things that I put in here are two other things directly related to that one is

528
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:45,791
[SPEAKER_13]: this question about boards and commissions.

529
00:37:46,031 --> 00:37:49,714
[SPEAKER_13]: As we all know, we only approve a certain small number of boards and commissions.

530
00:37:50,194 --> 00:37:55,337
[SPEAKER_13]: We've been trying to put into the ordinances more recently, adding, you know, confirmation.

531
00:37:56,218 --> 00:37:59,820
[SPEAKER_13]: But I really think that moving towards a real collaborative process where

532
00:38:01,416 --> 00:38:10,143
[SPEAKER_13]: There really is a public process for who gets appointed to what boards and commissions and this council is consulted is another valuable change in power that needs to happen.

533
00:38:10,583 --> 00:38:14,947
[SPEAKER_13]: And finally, this third question around the direct hiring of staff to support the city council.

534
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:17,189
[SPEAKER_13]: And to me, that could mean a lot of things.

535
00:38:17,249 --> 00:38:28,118
[SPEAKER_13]: I think having the authority to make that decision on our own is important, but specifically I'm thinking legal counsel, you know, sometimes I don't like to say it, but sometimes I, you know, Adam Knight was right.

536
00:38:28,955 --> 00:38:34,857
[SPEAKER_13]: And here we are in... It's in the record.

537
00:38:35,098 --> 00:38:35,818
[SPEAKER_06]: It's in the record.

538
00:38:36,338 --> 00:38:47,683
[SPEAKER_13]: But seriously, I'm as frustrated, I think, as you are, that we're sitting here on March 21st of this year, after June 28th of last year, and there's no one working in the city solicitor's office.

539
00:38:48,683 --> 00:38:57,807
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, there's a million potential explanations for why that is, but I'd like to give us, maybe people would wanna work for us.

540
00:38:58,895 --> 00:39:01,435
[SPEAKER_13]: maybe that's a difference of opinion.

541
00:39:01,635 --> 00:39:04,896
[SPEAKER_13]: And we don't know that, maybe I'm wrong, but I'd like to at least try it.

542
00:39:05,976 --> 00:39:11,617
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of other communities have multiple clerks working for councils, have a separate legal council working for city councils.

543
00:39:12,437 --> 00:39:16,518
[SPEAKER_13]: These are not crazy ideas, they are just things that we would need to change.

544
00:39:16,698 --> 00:39:27,820
[SPEAKER_13]: The process for us doing that, again, I think we should really look at it and have this committee of the whole, that's why I'm proposing this, but the process for that, and I think focusing on a small number of things makes the most sense here,

545
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:34,906
[SPEAKER_13]: is we have the authority under state law to put forward discrete amendments to the city charter.

546
00:39:35,027 --> 00:39:51,102
[SPEAKER_13]: Not a full charter review, not addressing representation or ward representation or who serves on the council, but specific targeted amendments to the charter to make sure that the balance of power is really fair in this community and that this council has the teeth to demand respect.

547
00:39:52,035 --> 00:40:01,583
[SPEAKER_13]: and to demand a part in the process because it's in the charter and not just because, you know, we have one vote that we can hold up or something else.

548
00:40:01,903 --> 00:40:07,868
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't disagree that there are other strategies that we need to do in the interim, but to me, how this would look is let's all sit down.

549
00:40:07,908 --> 00:40:14,033
[SPEAKER_13]: If we can all agree, or at least most of us, you know, five, six or seven of us can agree on some language, we can suggest that.

550
00:40:14,574 --> 00:40:19,478
[SPEAKER_13]: We can recommend it to be put forward to the voters to decide if they think that this balance of power would work.

551
00:40:20,421 --> 00:40:28,029
[SPEAKER_13]: That can go forward if the mayor says it goes forward she can be a part of that I mean obviously she can block it if she wants but if, again, all seven of us agree on that.

552
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:30,970
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd like the voters to make that choice.

553
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:32,271
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd like the people to make that choice.

554
00:40:32,771 --> 00:40:35,672
[SPEAKER_13]: And the other fallback position, I have thought this out a little bit.

555
00:40:36,192 --> 00:40:40,273
[SPEAKER_13]: We as a council have unilateral authority to put non-binding ballot questions on the ballot.

556
00:40:40,353 --> 00:40:57,197
[SPEAKER_13]: So if the mayor chooses that she doesn't want to put forward these amendments to the voters, if we agree on something that we would all like to put forward to the voters, we could put it on as a non-binding question in November, see what the people think, and then go back to the mayor after that and say, hey, 70% of the city thinks this is a good idea.

557
00:40:57,237 --> 00:40:58,417
[SPEAKER_13]: You really want to stand in the way?

558
00:40:59,818 --> 00:41:03,041
[SPEAKER_13]: in any case, or to whomever is the mayor in January.

559
00:41:03,121 --> 00:41:23,037
[SPEAKER_13]: But I just think these are common sense ways where not just today, not just last year, this year, next year, but for a long time, we can make sure that the Medford City Council, while still maintaining the form of government we have, has those tools that we don't have right now under the charter to do our job and do what residents want us to do.

560
00:41:23,177 --> 00:41:24,178
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's my thought here.

561
00:41:24,258 --> 00:41:24,518
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

562
00:41:26,598 --> 00:41:27,439
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President.

563
00:41:27,539 --> 00:41:30,260
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilman Pierce for bringing this forward.

564
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:41,167
[SPEAKER_06]: But let me start off by saying it's a sad day when elected official, when I became that elected official, we used to watch the council and laugh.

565
00:41:41,187 --> 00:41:42,348
[SPEAKER_06]: They were laughing stock.

566
00:41:42,368 --> 00:41:45,790
[SPEAKER_06]: It was all over YouTube because you had councils that were passionate.

567
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:52,454
[SPEAKER_06]: And here I am sounding like one of the disgruntled city councilors.

568
00:41:53,326 --> 00:41:54,787
[SPEAKER_06]: But I tell you, it's frustrating.

569
00:41:55,347 --> 00:42:06,312
[SPEAKER_06]: When we have to go to the lengths that Councilor Villes is going through right now and asking this, to go put this forward because we're not getting any information.

570
00:42:06,833 --> 00:42:07,973
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not getting any respect.

571
00:42:08,534 --> 00:42:13,416
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not moving the city forward at all in a partnership.

572
00:42:14,156 --> 00:42:15,397
[SPEAKER_06]: It's disheartening and depressing.

573
00:42:18,539 --> 00:42:19,219
[SPEAKER_06]: A good example.

574
00:42:20,756 --> 00:42:23,881
[SPEAKER_06]: is the effort that our council president has put forth.

575
00:42:25,464 --> 00:42:33,617
[SPEAKER_06]: Months ago, I asked, I recommended, requested a meeting with the council, the school committee, the mayor, and the superintendent.

576
00:42:34,338 --> 00:42:35,360
[SPEAKER_06]: And we talked about

577
00:42:36,218 --> 00:42:53,946
[SPEAKER_06]: And the concerns that I wanted to bring up is really just understanding the budget in a better way in the eyes of the school committee and how we can work together and also get a report of what has happened in the school district that has been absolutely devastating this year.

578
00:42:54,806 --> 00:43:04,831
[SPEAKER_06]: And we haven't, from what Council President, I won't speak for you, but I know that she's done her due diligence, reached out to everybody, but it's falling on one person.

579
00:43:06,114 --> 00:43:15,357
[SPEAKER_06]: And what it's telling me as we proceed with the budget for one Councilor, I'm going to have to assume that the school committee budget, the school budget is fine.

580
00:43:16,278 --> 00:43:22,360
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to have to assume that the school committee members that came to us and said, you won't meet with us.

581
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:25,801
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm to assume now that the budget is all set.

582
00:43:26,321 --> 00:43:27,421
[SPEAKER_06]: The school budget is tight.

583
00:43:27,782 --> 00:43:28,662
[SPEAKER_06]: They've got plenty of money.

584
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:34,405
[SPEAKER_06]: because that was asked for a couple months ago to sit with that committee.

585
00:43:35,185 --> 00:43:40,531
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I say the committee, it falls on the mayor because she's the president of that committee.

586
00:43:41,311 --> 00:43:42,533
[SPEAKER_06]: She's chairperson of that committee.

587
00:43:44,414 --> 00:43:49,820
[SPEAKER_06]: And not to have that meeting in place and be realistic now, we're not gonna have this meeting.

588
00:43:51,164 --> 00:43:55,707
[SPEAKER_06]: We're coming up into budget season, talking about capital plans, we have enough on our end.

589
00:43:56,347 --> 00:44:04,313
[SPEAKER_06]: So I could only assume, maybe we'll get a response back from one of the school team members in their Facebook posts, that the budget is perfect.

590
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:27,946
[SPEAKER_06]: because if you're not willing to sit with this council to understand the needs at the most crucial time that we've had in our community and our school department and over a few years since last major incident with the previous administration, it just shows you the lack of disrespect.

591
00:44:29,807 --> 00:44:31,208
[SPEAKER_06]: It just shows you that we have

592
00:44:35,474 --> 00:44:40,258
[SPEAKER_06]: It's comical in the fact that people come to me and ask me questions and I can only say, I don't know.

593
00:44:40,979 --> 00:44:41,900
[SPEAKER_06]: That's embarrassing.

594
00:44:44,021 --> 00:44:45,162
[SPEAKER_06]: And why is it embarrassing?

595
00:44:46,604 --> 00:44:51,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Because when I met with the mayor, and I met with the chief of staff in that office,

596
00:44:54,448 --> 00:44:59,489
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're talking about, I wanted to meet and talk about how I felt and that I felt contentious.

597
00:44:59,549 --> 00:45:00,969
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to get over that.

598
00:45:01,849 --> 00:45:03,270
[SPEAKER_06]: And I asked them to their faces.

599
00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:09,091
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, please allow the council to be part of the victories and part of the failures.

600
00:45:09,511 --> 00:45:10,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Let us share in that.

601
00:45:10,391 --> 00:45:11,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause that's what you're supposed to do.

602
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:13,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

603
00:45:17,612 --> 00:45:19,252
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't believe I've talked to the mayor since then.

604
00:45:21,053 --> 00:45:22,253
[SPEAKER_06]: The mayor hasn't come to this meeting.

605
00:45:24,013 --> 00:45:25,954
[SPEAKER_06]: The chief of staff is sometimes on Zoom.

606
00:45:25,974 --> 00:45:27,636
[SPEAKER_06]: We wouldn't know that because we don't have it in front of us.

607
00:45:27,956 --> 00:45:30,438
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if she's on tonight or not.

608
00:45:30,698 --> 00:45:31,318
[SPEAKER_06]: Not at the moment.

609
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:40,725
[SPEAKER_06]: It's comical because in neighbor communities, you have representatives sitting in the front row that work directly with their council.

610
00:45:43,127 --> 00:45:46,129
[SPEAKER_06]: That we don't have to try to reach out to department heads to get things done.

611
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:50,032
[SPEAKER_06]: That shouldn't happen anyway, just doesn't look right.

612
00:45:51,374 --> 00:45:55,438
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a liaison that works for the council and the mayor's office.

613
00:45:55,979 --> 00:46:01,365
[SPEAKER_06]: We know the mayor's busy, but not to have a representative here to talk with us and share these concerns?

614
00:46:03,367 --> 00:46:08,733
[SPEAKER_06]: When you have this much contention and this much anger, because that's what I feel, how do you expect to move the city forward?

615
00:46:08,753 --> 00:46:12,416
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care what anybody says, we're a mess.

616
00:46:15,067 --> 00:46:16,487
[SPEAKER_05]: Streets are a mess, parks are a mess.

617
00:46:17,168 --> 00:46:21,789
[SPEAKER_05]: The riverfront, this is what we're cheering.

618
00:46:23,109 --> 00:46:23,889
[SPEAKER_05]: We're revitalizing.

619
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:25,030
[SPEAKER_05]: What are we revitalizing?

620
00:46:28,371 --> 00:46:30,731
[SPEAKER_05]: We're promoting Porch Fest and all these great things.

621
00:46:32,492 --> 00:46:35,953
[SPEAKER_05]: But in the meantime, the castle's falling in.

622
00:46:37,093 --> 00:46:39,474
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody keep dancing on the dance floor, but the castle's falling in.

623
00:46:42,634 --> 00:46:48,156
[SPEAKER_06]: And excuse my frustration, please forgive my frustration because I know you all share it.

624
00:46:48,416 --> 00:46:56,819
[SPEAKER_06]: I know your personality probably doesn't match mine in the sense that sometimes I'm too vocal, but I'll be honest with you.

625
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:05,923
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate Councilor Bears bringing this forward, but I will tell you, I hate it, but I'm gonna bet my son on this.

626
00:47:06,763 --> 00:47:09,444
[SPEAKER_06]: The city can have my son, my 20 year old son,

627
00:47:10,993 --> 00:47:14,696
[SPEAKER_06]: if we have a meeting here, if something comes out with these resolutions.

628
00:47:16,357 --> 00:47:17,978
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how confident I am that nothing happens.

629
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:26,845
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, I'm gonna reiterate to my colleagues, let's keep giving her everything she wants because this is an election year.

630
00:47:26,905 --> 00:47:33,670
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's make sure they get everything they need, make sure all the fluffy stuff looks good so she can move forward for another two years.

631
00:47:35,372 --> 00:47:36,693
[SPEAKER_06]: Some days you have to say, stop.

632
00:47:38,358 --> 00:47:42,462
[SPEAKER_06]: So we need we get the respect that we need to help move the city forward.

633
00:47:43,002 --> 00:47:43,883
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President.

634
00:47:44,343 --> 00:47:45,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

635
00:47:45,284 --> 00:47:58,316
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, to your point that draft agenda for the joint meeting was sent to the council and it's it sits the mayor and her role as chair of the school committee and I continue to await her response as far as scheduling it and she has acknowledged receipt of it.

636
00:47:58,696 --> 00:47:59,397
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate that.

637
00:48:03,249 --> 00:48:03,569
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

638
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:09,434
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate the discussion on this issue so far for my fellow Councilors.

639
00:48:11,215 --> 00:48:27,086
[SPEAKER_14]: And I just want to note I think that this dovetails with the conversation that we just had about the discussion of a capital improvement plan I think that this dovetails with the conversation that the rules and ordinances subcommittee was having immediately before this meeting about measures that we can take within our power of the city council so that we can be a better

640
00:48:28,567 --> 00:48:36,870
[SPEAKER_14]: more meaningful, more actual source of representation, source of influence in the budget on behalf of this community.

641
00:48:36,890 --> 00:48:40,411
[SPEAKER_14]: I think President Morell, you say it all the time, a budget is a statement of values.

642
00:48:41,031 --> 00:48:50,713
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that the measures proposed in this resolution kind of cut to the heart of some of my most frequent frustrations with what we hear from constituents.

643
00:48:50,853 --> 00:48:51,874
[SPEAKER_14]: Why isn't this happening?

644
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:56,061
[SPEAKER_14]: Why isn't this, which essentially comes down to why isn't this budgeted for?

645
00:48:56,241 --> 00:48:59,581
[SPEAKER_14]: Why is the supportive service not exist in our city?

646
00:48:59,641 --> 00:49:01,021
[SPEAKER_14]: Why are things like this in this department?

647
00:49:01,061 --> 00:49:02,522
[SPEAKER_14]: Why are things like this infrastructurally?

648
00:49:03,142 --> 00:49:19,185
[SPEAKER_14]: And to have no real other recourse or explanation, but to say, I wish that we could at least have the discussion about what it would look like to appropriate funds so that this would change in the schools or this would change in the roads or the sidewalks or that we could entertain forming this new department to better support the segment of the constituency.

649
00:49:20,425 --> 00:49:21,185
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't have that power.

650
00:49:21,785 --> 00:49:26,228
[SPEAKER_14]: All that we have is the power to cut, to make line out of subtractions.

651
00:49:26,248 --> 00:49:31,112
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think we're all very aware of what that kind of power results in, in a budget process.

652
00:49:31,132 --> 00:49:32,713
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's not democratic.

653
00:49:33,814 --> 00:49:38,517
[SPEAKER_14]: There are a lot of elected officials in the city of Medford and there's only one that has a meaningful role.

654
00:49:39,622 --> 00:49:40,442
[SPEAKER_14]: in the budget process.

655
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:46,544
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think that these measures could potentially get us to a new solution around that.

656
00:49:48,164 --> 00:49:56,686
[SPEAKER_14]: Another one of our, I think our most common refrains in terms of deep, deep frustrations is not having the staff to carry out even the things that are within our jurisdiction to do.

657
00:49:57,406 --> 00:50:06,548
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's, I don't really have words for how frustrating it is sometimes because I think it is a rarity for a council to be this unified on so many issues.

658
00:50:07,335 --> 00:50:10,117
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a really big hurdle to overcome in any public body, I think.

659
00:50:10,798 --> 00:50:23,208
[SPEAKER_14]: And yet we hit a stumbling block because we don't have the resources, we don't have the personnel to execute the work ethic that we do have on a disparate set of issues.

660
00:50:24,629 --> 00:50:35,438
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think that whatever form this takes, if it's the form of a home rule petition, I think this is a discussion that needs to happen because I think these are roadblocks that could really be orders of magnitude in terms of

661
00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:40,956
[SPEAKER_14]: increasing our influence to better represent the will of the community in these chambers.

662
00:50:41,337 --> 00:50:43,480
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

663
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:44,401
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

664
00:50:44,822 --> 00:50:48,006
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, and thank you Vice President Bears for putting this on the agenda.

665
00:50:48,647 --> 00:50:53,934
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, I think this is a fairly straightforward resolution, but at the end of the day, I think it's about, um, having

666
00:50:54,894 --> 00:51:14,647
[SPEAKER_12]: more accountability, the idea that more accountability is better between different arms of government, more transparency is better, giving residents more of an opportunity to participate in the whole budget process in the running of our city, giving them a chance to speak up about what they want to see in our budget,

667
00:51:14,907 --> 00:51:19,889
[SPEAKER_12]: and not just to see a budget come back with two or two and a half percent slapped slapped on every department right.

668
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:29,033
[SPEAKER_12]: I think this is this is about getting residents in us involved in giving us more of a balance in our relationship with the city.

669
00:51:30,114 --> 00:51:34,976
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's fairly fairly obvious anyone watching the council meetings and

670
00:51:35,336 --> 00:51:40,460
[SPEAKER_12]: who's been paying attention to city politics in the last, maybe even decades.

671
00:51:40,981 --> 00:51:45,685
[SPEAKER_12]: Sometimes, you know, our relationship with the executive office isn't the most collaborative.

672
00:51:47,530 --> 00:52:01,482
[SPEAKER_12]: might be an understatement, but when that relationship isn't as collaborative as we want it to be, I think we also need to take up the steps to build the structure that will force us to collaborate with each other.

673
00:52:01,822 --> 00:52:12,552
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think at the end of the day, this is what this resolution is about, about building those structures to have us talk to each other and to force us to have those conversations and to build that forum for residents to participate.

674
00:52:13,212 --> 00:52:18,994
[SPEAKER_12]: I think Councilor Bears' last point about, is really important.

675
00:52:19,034 --> 00:52:24,636
[SPEAKER_12]: He said that oftentimes residents come up to us and ask us questions about what we can do.

676
00:52:24,776 --> 00:52:28,698
[SPEAKER_12]: And they assume that we have some powers that we don't actually have.

677
00:52:28,818 --> 00:52:33,459
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's oftentimes a shocker that, you know, what residents are asking us to do, we can't carry that out.

678
00:52:34,099 --> 00:52:39,701
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think it's really important to have those conversations about, you know, residents are asking us to be,

679
00:52:42,022 --> 00:52:53,029
[SPEAKER_12]: have more oversight residents are asking us to do X, Y, and Z. How do we have that conversation about what needs to change and what we need to put forward to voters to have that change take place?

680
00:52:53,490 --> 00:53:01,835
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I think this is, I'm very much looking forward to this committee of the whole and to the whole process that hopefully happens after it is all.

681
00:53:02,395 --> 00:53:02,676
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

682
00:53:02,756 --> 00:53:03,316
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Caraviello.

683
00:53:03,576 --> 00:53:04,457
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Madam President.

684
00:53:05,177 --> 00:53:06,778
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Bears shouldn't have had to put this forward.

685
00:53:08,119 --> 00:53:10,861
[SPEAKER_09]: This council is not a partner in government at all.

686
00:53:11,397 --> 00:53:17,841
[SPEAKER_09]: This is my third administration serving with, and you can say what you want about the other two.

687
00:53:18,561 --> 00:53:22,864
[SPEAKER_09]: They may have been, but we were always a partner in government with them.

688
00:53:23,864 --> 00:53:24,985
[SPEAKER_09]: We are not a partner at all.

689
00:53:25,225 --> 00:53:27,807
[SPEAKER_09]: We were elected by the same people that elected the mayor.

690
00:53:28,867 --> 00:53:37,973
[SPEAKER_09]: And as Councilor Scapi, this group gets virtually no answers, no respect or anything from anybody in this building.

691
00:53:39,608 --> 00:53:41,410
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to go to people directly.

692
00:53:41,430 --> 00:53:44,152
[SPEAKER_09]: Someone asked me something, I go to directly to the office.

693
00:53:44,392 --> 00:53:46,413
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't call anybody, I come in in person.

694
00:53:46,834 --> 00:53:47,935
[SPEAKER_09]: This is not the way it should be.

695
00:53:49,396 --> 00:53:55,740
[SPEAKER_09]: We shouldn't be asking for this resolution for things that should be here already for us.

696
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:58,002
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I'm saying?

697
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:03,732
[SPEAKER_09]: He's not asking for anything crazy here that's not out of the ordinary.

698
00:54:04,032 --> 00:54:05,632
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not a partner in government.

699
00:54:06,032 --> 00:54:10,134
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's a shame because we're all elected by the same group of people.

700
00:54:11,174 --> 00:54:13,115
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, I support this.

701
00:54:13,435 --> 00:54:16,356
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, it's something that shouldn't even have to be out there.

702
00:54:17,817 --> 00:54:19,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

703
00:54:19,718 --> 00:54:20,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice is embarrassed.

704
00:54:21,567 --> 00:54:33,902
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Madam President, I just want to I want to speak to what all my colleagues have a specific accounts to Scarpelli's points earlier I mean, you know, I do think we all share the frustration we may all express it differently and that's that is what it is but but I do think we share it.

705
00:54:34,362 --> 00:54:36,385
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think to Councilor Caraviello's point.

706
00:54:38,130 --> 00:54:39,671
[SPEAKER_13]: shouldn't have to put this in the charter.

707
00:54:40,211 --> 00:54:43,334
[SPEAKER_13]: To me it's it's it's bad politics to not just do this.

708
00:54:44,054 --> 00:54:44,274
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

709
00:54:44,434 --> 00:55:01,786
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean it hasn't worked out that way, apparently, but you know, keep some money aside, so that council priorities can be considered in the budget process, give the council some time to consider the process give enough time to have a good process, say to the council are there staff and supports that you need that will provide and you don't have to leverage to get it.

710
00:55:02,486 --> 00:55:03,207
[SPEAKER_13]: Give the council

711
00:55:03,794 --> 00:55:09,778
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, time and consideration and an actual packet of information when you're appointing someone to a board and commission so we can review it and approve it.

712
00:55:10,198 --> 00:55:16,042
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it's not just Somerville, it's like every other city in the Commonwealth that does this this way.

713
00:55:16,663 --> 00:55:23,467
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think, again, just on a pure politics, it's like, while you're not doing it, you're just taking an L for no reason.

714
00:55:24,288 --> 00:55:25,609
[SPEAKER_13]: And that I don't get at all.

715
00:55:26,109 --> 00:55:31,333
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, if suddenly there's a policy to just start doing all of this without changing the charter,

716
00:55:32,235 --> 00:55:32,956
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm all for it.

717
00:55:33,096 --> 00:55:33,997
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a lot easier.

718
00:55:34,017 --> 00:55:48,890
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a lot less time that I'm going to go around all fall hopefully saying to everyone I talked to is voting, hey, this is a reasonable thing that this council needs to be a fair partner in government, please vote for it because it's just like basic governance and due diligence for a community.

719
00:55:49,752 --> 00:55:54,416
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, what I rather spend my time actually doing the process and doing the thing.

720
00:55:54,716 --> 00:55:55,337
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.

721
00:55:55,797 --> 00:56:12,192
[SPEAKER_13]: But again, I think really it would comes down to the only reason to not do this as you maintain power to control power to withhold power to stall power to hide, and that's where Councilors got placed point comes in, you know, when we don't have the information that we want.

722
00:56:13,373 --> 00:56:20,443
[SPEAKER_13]: And I can hear you that an answer to you feels like we just shouldn't do these things because we're giving them what they want and we're not getting what we want.

723
00:56:20,863 --> 00:56:23,787
[SPEAKER_13]: And I hear that, you know, on principle, I probably agree with that.

724
00:56:24,612 --> 00:56:36,099
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just, then I go and I hear, well, we're gonna lose this person and this person and this person, or, you know, I hear directly from Tim or Chief Friedman, like, these are essential needs that we have now.

725
00:56:36,139 --> 00:56:40,541
[SPEAKER_13]: It's gonna take three years to get a fire truck, you know, from the producer.

726
00:56:40,581 --> 00:56:43,343
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's like, so can we hold off and wait on that?

727
00:56:44,143 --> 00:56:45,844
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't wanna be the person saying no.

728
00:56:46,184 --> 00:56:51,227
[SPEAKER_13]: I also don't wanna be the person put in the position of feeling like I should say no, because I don't know if it's a good idea.

729
00:56:52,028 --> 00:56:53,549
[SPEAKER_13]: And that is what this is about.

730
00:56:54,638 --> 00:56:56,899
[SPEAKER_13]: not we should never be in that position.

731
00:56:57,079 --> 00:57:00,882
[SPEAKER_13]: It should never be people are coming here and saying, please let me do my job.

732
00:57:01,622 --> 00:57:04,684
[SPEAKER_13]: Because there's that lack of mistrust and partnership and collaboration.

733
00:57:04,964 --> 00:57:06,465
[SPEAKER_13]: That's just not the way to run a thing.

734
00:57:07,265 --> 00:57:10,407
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, I just think it's not good practice in general.

735
00:57:11,087 --> 00:57:12,328
[SPEAKER_13]: Would I rather not do this?

736
00:57:12,528 --> 00:57:15,370
[SPEAKER_13]: Honestly, probably Yeah, but you know,

737
00:57:16,321 --> 00:57:17,762
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a charter review process going on.

738
00:57:17,802 --> 00:57:18,743
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe there's a new charter by 2026.

739
00:57:19,404 --> 00:57:23,187
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't want to wait three and a half years to see if we can do that.

740
00:57:23,608 --> 00:57:30,894
[SPEAKER_13]: If we can put common sense stuff that I know that, again, the different political people in this room disagree on a lot, but we kind of agree on this.

741
00:57:31,294 --> 00:57:34,577
[SPEAKER_13]: People I talk to in the community say, hey, that sounds like a reasonable good idea.

742
00:57:35,430 --> 00:57:40,134
[SPEAKER_13]: I think if you put these three simple ideas in front of voters, they're gonna say, yeah, that's probably a good way to run a city.

743
00:57:40,714 --> 00:57:42,035
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's really all this is about.

744
00:57:42,195 --> 00:57:51,922
[SPEAKER_13]: So if there's another alternative that can come down the pike and we can go down that route and have this collaboration without having to go through a process like this, great.

745
00:57:52,283 --> 00:57:53,223
[SPEAKER_13]: But I don't see it either.

746
00:57:53,243 --> 00:57:57,446
[SPEAKER_13]: That's, you know, if I had a son to give to the city, that would be.

747
00:57:57,466 --> 00:58:01,930
[SPEAKER_13]: But that's really it.

748
00:58:02,910 --> 00:58:04,151
[SPEAKER_13]: I appreciate the discussion.

749
00:58:04,211 --> 00:58:04,852
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks everybody.

750
00:58:05,578 --> 00:58:10,260
[SPEAKER_17]: Madam President, um, you know, I really don't think this should be about politics at all.

751
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:15,681
[SPEAKER_17]: Right, it should be about the city of Medford, and what's the best course for our city, what's our city's best course.

752
00:58:16,102 --> 00:58:16,322
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

753
00:58:16,882 --> 00:58:19,783
[SPEAKER_17]: And ultimately, you know, Council of business right.

754
00:58:20,643 --> 00:58:20,883
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

755
00:58:21,403 --> 00:58:22,844
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think this is bad politics though.

756
00:58:23,504 --> 00:58:24,664
[SPEAKER_17]: I think this is bad governing.

757
00:58:25,445 --> 00:58:29,066
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what I think I think it's bad governing I don't think it's bad politics, I think it's bad governing.

758
00:58:29,727 --> 00:58:30,828
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, it's not political at all.

759
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:32,429
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not political at all.

760
00:58:32,749 --> 00:58:33,570
[SPEAKER_17]: It's bad governing.

761
00:58:34,130 --> 00:58:34,771
[SPEAKER_17]: It's bad governing.

762
00:58:35,211 --> 00:58:37,172
[SPEAKER_17]: And bad governing leads to bad outcomes.

763
00:58:37,432 --> 00:58:38,273
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's what we're getting.

764
00:58:38,593 --> 00:58:42,496
[SPEAKER_17]: So when I sit here and I think back, am I better off now living in the city of Medford than I was four years ago?

765
00:58:42,516 --> 00:58:43,297
[SPEAKER_17]: What do I say to myself?

766
00:58:44,317 --> 00:58:45,118
[SPEAKER_17]: What do I say to myself?

767
00:58:45,858 --> 00:58:48,600
[SPEAKER_17]: I say, we have teachers taking a vote of no confidence in the school committee and the mayor.

768
00:58:48,921 --> 00:58:50,362
[SPEAKER_17]: We got kids in our schools getting stabbed.

769
00:58:50,842 --> 00:58:54,645
[SPEAKER_17]: Every street you drive down, you can't even, you can't avoid a pothole if you wanted to.

770
00:58:56,046 --> 00:58:57,787
[SPEAKER_17]: We're failing in the delivery of city services.

771
00:58:59,242 --> 00:59:02,464
[SPEAKER_17]: We haven't had one successful construction project since Mayor Burke closed the books.

772
00:59:04,306 --> 00:59:13,172
[SPEAKER_17]: We're bringing out a brand new plan, a brand new plan for Medford Square that they took off the shelf when Stephanie left, blew the dust off of and said, it's mine.

773
00:59:15,774 --> 00:59:16,455
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that it right there?

774
00:59:19,076 --> 00:59:23,700
[SPEAKER_17]: Exact same proposal that was there from before, right?

775
00:59:24,827 --> 00:59:27,789
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, it's not bad politics, it's bad governing.

776
00:59:28,050 --> 00:59:30,912
[SPEAKER_17]: And bad governing leads to bad outcomes, and that's what we're stuck with right now.

777
00:59:33,474 --> 00:59:34,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Any further discussion from the council?

778
00:59:36,517 --> 00:59:37,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Name and address for the record, please.

779
00:59:38,959 --> 00:59:41,541
[SPEAKER_00]: Nicole Bramley, my address is on record.

780
00:59:42,121 --> 00:59:49,828
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think Councilor Scarpelli has given enough of his son through the years.

781
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:56,122
[SPEAKER_00]: just as I've given enough of my daughter, okay?

782
00:59:56,843 --> 01:00:01,326
[SPEAKER_00]: So I also have been frustrated that there was no joint meeting.

783
01:00:02,206 --> 01:00:09,371
[SPEAKER_00]: President Morell can confirm that I have emailed her repeatedly regarding the meeting.

784
01:00:09,771 --> 01:00:19,458
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did speak to you, I think it was last week and still really didn't get an answer of when it would happen.

785
01:00:19,918 --> 01:00:21,479
[SPEAKER_00]: So I emailed the mayor myself

786
01:00:22,113 --> 01:00:23,294
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did get a response.

787
01:00:24,655 --> 01:00:28,017
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm hoping that it's okay that I share this.

788
01:00:28,217 --> 01:00:29,418
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was from her public account.

789
01:00:29,538 --> 01:00:30,659
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm assuming it's okay.

790
01:00:30,779 --> 01:00:32,680
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do, because I did not get it.

791
01:00:33,501 --> 01:00:33,901
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

792
01:00:34,081 --> 01:00:43,647
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, not to ever go over anybody's head, but when I don't get an answer, I think that you know that I'm pretty persistent and look for the answers myself.

793
01:00:43,727 --> 01:00:50,372
[SPEAKER_00]: So it says, Nicole, I am discussing the draft outline guidelines, which I actually thought was already done.

794
01:00:52,350 --> 01:00:54,271
[SPEAKER_00]: So it says, which I'm not saying it's a lie.

795
01:00:54,291 --> 01:00:55,552
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying, I thought that that was already done.

796
01:00:55,572 --> 01:01:03,517
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I am discussing the draft outlined guidelines with the members and then hope to send around a doodle poll on dates people are free after that.

797
01:01:03,537 --> 01:01:05,899
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

798
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:08,480
[SPEAKER_00]: So just FYI.

799
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:13,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and that draft is something that vice chair Graham and I put together and it's not, you know, it's nothing crazy.

800
01:01:13,883 --> 01:01:16,645
[SPEAKER_03]: It's modeled after other cities that have these joint meetings with some frequency.

801
01:01:16,665 --> 01:01:16,945
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.

802
01:01:16,965 --> 01:01:17,786
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.

803
01:01:18,066 --> 01:01:19,147
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just thought I would just.

804
01:01:19,427 --> 01:01:20,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I appreciate that.

805
01:01:20,027 --> 01:01:20,267
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

806
01:01:20,287 --> 01:01:20,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Let you know that.

807
01:01:22,070 --> 01:01:24,052
[SPEAKER_00]: Any time you want.

808
01:01:26,515 --> 01:01:27,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Any further discussion?

809
01:01:27,275 --> 01:01:32,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Madam Chief of Staff, do you have something to speak on this?

810
01:01:33,462 --> 01:01:34,843
[SPEAKER_18]: There was a delay on the

811
01:01:36,768 --> 01:01:50,993
[SPEAKER_18]: aired live meeting, so I'm not sure which topic you're specifically on, but I wanted to speak on the last discussion that was relating to the budget and charter change and various matters.

812
01:01:51,013 --> 01:01:51,814
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still on that.

813
01:01:51,834 --> 01:01:52,894
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, excellent, excellent.

814
01:01:53,722 --> 01:01:54,923
[SPEAKER_18]: So if I have, if I may.

815
01:01:55,624 --> 01:01:55,984
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

816
01:01:56,464 --> 01:02:03,650
[SPEAKER_18]: I just, I was listening to the discussion and frankly, I think there's quite a number of pieces that are not being discussed here tonight.

817
01:02:03,670 --> 01:02:07,493
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think they're important for discussion and inclusion in this topic.

818
01:02:08,814 --> 01:02:14,879
[SPEAKER_18]: It strikes me that there have been a number of different conversations with city council members that are not coming up here tonight.

819
01:02:15,359 --> 01:02:20,083
[SPEAKER_18]: It strikes me that, you know, the city council knows that we're working, you know,

820
01:02:21,271 --> 01:02:25,094
[SPEAKER_18]: at all hours to try to further the government in all aspects.

821
01:02:25,655 --> 01:02:33,542
[SPEAKER_18]: But yet we're standing here and this council knows that it voted for three in, you know, essentially what failed, a charter change.

822
01:02:34,522 --> 01:02:41,889
[SPEAKER_18]: That was certainly an option by this council, but only four out of three members voted it and it doesn't move forward at that point.

823
01:02:41,929 --> 01:02:46,473
[SPEAKER_17]: I do believe the paper before us as to whether or not we want to have a committee of the whole, no more, no less.

824
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:47,901
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

825
01:02:48,061 --> 01:02:52,266
[SPEAKER_18]: President Morell, a point of information is not to interrupt the speaker.

826
01:02:52,446 --> 01:02:54,449
[SPEAKER_03]: I hear what you're saying.

827
01:02:54,509 --> 01:02:55,911
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm chairing the meeting.

828
01:02:56,251 --> 01:02:58,494
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm chairing the meeting, and it's under my discretion.

829
01:02:58,734 --> 01:02:59,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Understood.

830
01:02:59,635 --> 01:03:01,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Historically, yes.

831
01:03:01,458 --> 01:03:02,479
[SPEAKER_03]: If we look at Robert's Rules of Order,

832
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:05,381
[SPEAKER_03]: we would use it at wrong for probably 40 years, but I'm not.

833
01:03:05,821 --> 01:03:06,882
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not tackling it tonight.

834
01:03:07,022 --> 01:03:08,102
[SPEAKER_18]: So I understand.

835
01:03:08,122 --> 01:03:18,909
[SPEAKER_18]: And the only thing the only final thing I will say on that is I am constantly interrupted by Councilor Knight using point of information, and I simply request that I be given the same opportunity to speak as others are given.

836
01:03:19,870 --> 01:03:22,011
[SPEAKER_18]: He interrupts everyone, but please continue.

837
01:03:22,491 --> 01:03:22,812
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

838
01:03:24,693 --> 01:03:28,255
[SPEAKER_18]: So you know, there are a number of our account counts tonight.

839
01:03:29,095 --> 01:03:29,616
[SPEAKER_18]: Give me a break.

840
01:03:30,376 --> 01:03:30,937
[SPEAKER_18]: Please continue.

841
01:03:31,197 --> 01:03:31,497
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

842
01:03:33,439 --> 01:03:44,428
[SPEAKER_18]: So all I'm saying, all I'd like to share here tonight is the fact that there are, you know, Councilor Caraviello, you were in the mayor's office two weeks ago discussing matters with the mayor, were you not?

843
01:03:46,710 --> 01:03:50,073
[SPEAKER_18]: Other members, I'm just pointing out that there is communication that's going on.

844
01:03:50,113 --> 01:03:51,954
[SPEAKER_18]: You mentioned that you haven't stopped in any offices.

845
01:03:51,994 --> 01:03:53,415
[SPEAKER_18]: You need to go direct to individuals.

846
01:03:54,817 --> 01:03:56,018
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, and that's perfectly fine.

847
01:03:56,038 --> 01:03:57,559
[SPEAKER_18]: And I welcome you to come directly to me.

848
01:03:57,579 --> 01:03:59,841
[SPEAKER_18]: I welcome you to come directly to me.

849
01:04:00,721 --> 01:04:01,042
[SPEAKER_18]: And so,

850
01:04:03,737 --> 01:04:21,182
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, that was a part of today's discussion, Madam President, you know, that was a part of the discussion that was occurring today where there's no communication, members, other members of the city council with the Vice President and the President were on text messages with the mayor all day today discussing matters with regard to tonight's meeting and I appreciate that and she appreciates that.

851
01:04:21,642 --> 01:04:26,763
[SPEAKER_17]: My point here is, if anyone will share what type of communications with this.

852
01:04:29,123 --> 01:04:36,489
[SPEAKER_18]: communications, Madam President, through you, communications with regard to tonight's meeting questions that members have.

853
01:04:36,509 --> 01:04:46,578
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe one of them was a question from the President, if you don't mind me saying it, about why a press release went out about stuff urging us to vote on something before we'd even gotten an email saying that free cash was certified.

854
01:04:47,679 --> 01:04:48,339
[SPEAKER_13]: We communicate.

855
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:51,722
[SPEAKER_13]: Things have been slightly better in the past few months, and I appreciate that.

856
01:04:51,742 --> 01:04:52,743
[SPEAKER_13]: We're getting things done.

857
01:04:53,383 --> 01:05:05,072
[SPEAKER_13]: And I understand your frustration with me putting this forward in the presentation, but there's a difference between having a little bit better communication and having real collaboration and the intentionality.

858
01:05:07,854 --> 01:05:09,155
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm glad we're getting more stuff done.

859
01:05:09,196 --> 01:05:11,017
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm really glad, but that doesn't change this.

860
01:05:12,038 --> 01:05:14,259
[SPEAKER_13]: We had the presentation from Bob that we were promised November 15th.

861
01:05:15,728 --> 01:05:16,449
[SPEAKER_13]: in February.

862
01:05:17,370 --> 01:05:20,693
[SPEAKER_13]: We got the legal stuff today, but it's not really all the legal stuff.

863
01:05:21,073 --> 01:05:23,235
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a part of the legal stuff and some of it was missing.

864
01:05:23,496 --> 01:05:24,917
[SPEAKER_13]: And I understand mistakes happen.

865
01:05:25,558 --> 01:05:27,259
[SPEAKER_13]: And I understand we're not all gonna be perfect.

866
01:05:27,279 --> 01:05:38,070
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm sorry that I cut into this conversation, but if you're gonna talk about the text messages that I sent trying to get that information that we have so we can have a meeting where we don't have a blow up every time,

867
01:05:38,912 --> 01:05:40,093
[SPEAKER_13]: That's all I'm trying to do.

868
01:05:40,113 --> 01:05:46,175
[SPEAKER_13]: If we could call it bad government, call it bad politics, it's just like, how many unforced L's are we gonna take, man?

869
01:05:46,775 --> 01:05:47,896
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, I can't take it.

870
01:05:48,576 --> 01:05:54,539
[SPEAKER_13]: There's just things that are mistakes that don't need to happen that happen, and I'm not trying to blame anybody, but at a certain point,

871
01:05:56,300 --> 01:06:01,867
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just really frustrating and I'm sure you're really frustrated with things that we do that some of us do that all of us do that we as a body do.

872
01:06:02,628 --> 01:06:03,269
[SPEAKER_13]: That's okay.

873
01:06:03,329 --> 01:06:07,675
[SPEAKER_13]: We're not always going to always agree, but the way that the balance of power is set up right now.

874
01:06:08,275 --> 01:06:09,317
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just not right.

875
01:06:09,717 --> 01:06:13,202
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just not fair, and it's just going to lead us back to these situations where

876
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:15,381
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe communication's a little bit better.

877
01:06:15,401 --> 01:06:19,585
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe instead of 20% of what we asked for, we get 60% of what I asked for.

878
01:06:19,665 --> 01:06:23,728
[SPEAKER_13]: So maybe the problem's only 40% bad instead of 80% bad.

879
01:06:23,848 --> 01:06:25,189
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just not how I want to operate.

880
01:06:25,449 --> 01:06:28,151
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm sorry that it came across as accusatory.

881
01:06:28,171 --> 01:06:29,572
[SPEAKER_13]: And I never said no communication.

882
01:06:30,413 --> 01:06:32,454
[SPEAKER_13]: I said collaborative, transparent.

883
01:06:32,854 --> 01:06:34,895
[SPEAKER_13]: I said balancing power better.

884
01:06:35,035 --> 01:06:42,399
[SPEAKER_13]: I said opening up more democratic processes so that like this council has a real balance of power with the mayoral administration across the hall.

885
01:06:42,879 --> 01:06:46,381
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, the Charter Review Committee knows, everybody knows we have the strongest plan A charter.

886
01:06:46,621 --> 01:06:50,043
[SPEAKER_13]: Basically in the state, the mayor is incredibly powerful.

887
01:06:50,483 --> 01:06:54,145
[SPEAKER_13]: And all I'm saying is that there's negative externalities and effects from that.

888
01:06:54,465 --> 01:06:58,587
[SPEAKER_13]: I would never, if I was sitting across that hall and this was the discussion, would I want to give it away?

889
01:06:59,207 --> 01:07:11,172
[SPEAKER_13]: No, because I have a lot of control, and I can control the timeline I control when something comes out and I can control, you know, the situation I can try to insulate myself from from from problems and I understand the appeal of that.

890
01:07:11,592 --> 01:07:14,734
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just not what I think is best for the city at this point.

891
01:07:15,154 --> 01:07:20,056
[SPEAKER_13]: I really, again I understand the frustration I appreciate you being here I appreciate this, having this dialogue.

892
01:07:20,616 --> 01:07:25,338
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to stop talking now I want to hear your response to everything that I just said, not going to

893
01:07:25,768 --> 01:07:54,897
[SPEAKER_13]: cut you off and I don't know that I've maybe done it once or twice in the past two years and I'm, you know, I'm trying to be someone who doesn't do that but, you know, it's a fundamental question and, you know, I don't always have six people on behind this rail agreeing with me but for the past year and a half, I pretty much we all agree on these basic things and, you know, you can be the most progressive person in the city, you might be the most conservative person in the city or very conservative person in the city

894
01:07:56,188 --> 01:07:56,968
[SPEAKER_13]: this appeals to them.

895
01:07:56,988 --> 01:08:03,890
[SPEAKER_13]: And I hope that we can move forward with maybe changing the balance of power to have a different kind of discussion and collaborative relationship going forward.

896
01:08:04,530 --> 01:08:12,111
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't mean I'm, you know, trying to diss the communication that we have been having, although I understand that it's a difficult conversation that may come off that way.

897
01:08:12,191 --> 01:08:12,791
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you.

898
01:08:13,371 --> 01:08:15,892
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do just want to, you know, affirm what Vice President Bears said.

899
01:08:15,932 --> 01:08:21,433
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, just to add background, you know, I got a text from the mayor today telling me who's going to be at the meeting,

900
01:08:21,850 --> 01:08:25,214
[SPEAKER_03]: saying our free cash was certified didn't say didn't say the amount didn't say anything.

901
01:08:25,534 --> 01:08:26,776
[SPEAKER_03]: And I very much appreciated that.

902
01:08:27,316 --> 01:08:41,272
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we get a missive of a press release, urging the council to vote for something that has not been presented to the council that has not been asked for us to vote for tells us this free cash number via press release, and then we get an email from you after the fact that says see press release.

903
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:56,968
[SPEAKER_03]: And seeing us, speaking from the chair, I shouldn't be getting this specific, but seeing us as partners, if that wasn't a mistake saying, dear city council, I'm sorry that this went out before it got to you, as opposed to an email that just says see press release.

904
01:08:57,068 --> 01:08:57,648
[SPEAKER_18]: We're partners.

905
01:08:58,129 --> 01:09:06,093
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'd like to address that because there was just a drop in communication in the office and I failed on my side to get certain communication out in a timely fashion.

906
01:09:06,153 --> 01:09:07,694
[SPEAKER_18]: So I take responsibility for that.

907
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:12,301
[SPEAKER_18]: So and I'm happy to say right now to the city council, I apologize.

908
01:09:12,341 --> 01:09:13,541
[SPEAKER_18]: I genuinely apologize.

909
01:09:13,581 --> 01:09:15,082
[SPEAKER_18]: It wasn't meant to be so disjointed.

910
01:09:15,502 --> 01:09:20,363
[SPEAKER_18]: We wanted to get you the information on the free cash amount prior to the press release going out.

911
01:09:20,423 --> 01:09:21,104
[SPEAKER_18]: It's quite simple.

912
01:09:21,384 --> 01:09:22,044
[SPEAKER_03]: And I get that.

913
01:09:22,104 --> 01:09:28,646
[SPEAKER_03]: And just one comment as a communications person, ask and urge have two very different meanings and feelings.

914
01:09:28,986 --> 01:09:32,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Asking the city council to approve something, which we've never been asked before versus urging

915
01:09:33,393 --> 01:09:36,194
[SPEAKER_03]: which has the subtext of, I've asked them and they're not doing it.

916
01:09:36,854 --> 01:09:38,035
[SPEAKER_03]: These things matter.

917
01:09:38,515 --> 01:09:39,235
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe that's not for you.

918
01:09:39,275 --> 01:09:45,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe that's for the comms director, but just, if we're gonna get into the weeds, I'll get in there with you a little bit.

919
01:09:45,738 --> 01:09:50,240
[SPEAKER_18]: But- I do look at these releases, not every one of them, but I do look at these releases before they go out.

920
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:52,081
[SPEAKER_18]: So I take that.

921
01:09:52,321 --> 01:09:52,581
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

922
01:09:53,382 --> 01:10:05,425
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't and Councilor bears Vice President Bears I don't have an issue in the way it's presented I what I'm here to talk about and here to discuss with the city council is the fact that I don't feel like, you know,

923
01:10:08,001 --> 01:10:12,606
[SPEAKER_18]: the entire council is presenting all aspects of this discussion.

924
01:10:12,766 --> 01:10:25,601
[SPEAKER_18]: And part of it is, look, if the mayor had control concerns about giving up control, why would she present and vote for historically a charter change and ask this council to vote and consider a charter change for a review?

925
01:10:26,582 --> 01:10:33,105
[SPEAKER_18]: That was for the intention of trying to make these changes, which she feels if the community wants it, the community wants it.

926
01:10:33,165 --> 01:10:34,425
[SPEAKER_18]: She believes the community wants it.

927
01:10:34,525 --> 01:10:38,947
[SPEAKER_18]: So what's holding us back from actually pursuing a charter review?

928
01:10:39,247 --> 01:10:43,169
[SPEAKER_18]: That's a perfect opportunity to have these types of discussions, have these types of changes.

929
01:10:43,549 --> 01:10:50,392
[SPEAKER_18]: If the community wishes to modify the amount of authority that's vested in the mayor, which I agree with you about, Vice President Bears, it is vested there.

930
01:10:50,892 --> 01:10:54,714
[SPEAKER_18]: And so if somebody has that authority, they also have that responsibility.

931
01:10:55,075 --> 01:10:57,416
[SPEAKER_18]: And she takes that responsibility very seriously.

932
01:10:57,756 --> 01:11:00,918
[SPEAKER_18]: And she will continue to take that responsibility seriously to do her job.

933
01:11:01,278 --> 01:11:04,440
[SPEAKER_18]: She is up against a mountain of challenges that exist historically.

934
01:11:04,741 --> 01:11:10,664
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not a scenario where she's come through the door and she's, you know, just kind of keeping the wheels in motion in this organization.

935
01:11:10,704 --> 01:11:11,725
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a lot to be done.

936
01:11:12,993 --> 01:11:22,176
[SPEAKER_18]: So, I mean, I don't need to tell you because our finance director has stood before you has spoken before you the challenges that we have in our financial software they hold us back.

937
01:11:22,817 --> 01:11:30,539
[SPEAKER_18]: We have a tremendous amount of work that we need to do that affects our ability to get things to the city council in a timely fashion, I wish that wasn't the case.

938
01:11:30,979 --> 01:11:31,680
[SPEAKER_18]: I wish we had.

939
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:35,141
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm not going to rehash the historical challenges we've had.

940
01:11:35,561 --> 01:11:37,122
[SPEAKER_18]: in coming before you with information.

941
01:11:37,563 --> 01:11:51,573
[SPEAKER_18]: But all I will say is we're working on those pieces and we hear some of your points, and we don't have any intention to slight you, but if anyone wants to come meet with me or the mayor, our door, if it's not physically open, is always open to meet with you all.

942
01:11:52,073 --> 01:11:58,218
[SPEAKER_18]: Individually, in a smaller groups, not quorums obviously, but we're happy to do that.

943
01:11:58,238 --> 01:12:00,720
[SPEAKER_18]: There are certain pieces of information that are,

944
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:21,865
[SPEAKER_18]: truly the executive offices to handle and they're not matters of the city council like personnel issues that comes up often here, we're not going to come before you we're not going to talk about personnel issues we're not going to go into detail about what's going on in personnel matters, I don't care how many times the Secretary Treasurer of this teamsters comes before you and rants about the various issues that exist, and all the problems that exist.

945
01:12:25,186 --> 01:12:28,227
[SPEAKER_17]: This administration has been horrible to the working people in this community.

946
01:12:28,727 --> 01:12:29,907
[SPEAKER_17]: Absolutely horrible.

947
01:12:30,488 --> 01:12:35,949
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, absolutely horrible to say it's all Steve salts, making stuff up is an absolute joke.

948
01:12:36,449 --> 01:12:37,450
[SPEAKER_17]: An absolute joke.

949
01:12:37,750 --> 01:12:40,351
[SPEAKER_17]: They're putting GPS trackers on people's personal vehicles.

950
01:12:40,631 --> 01:12:42,051
[SPEAKER_17]: They're hiring private investigators.

951
01:12:42,091 --> 01:12:45,412
[SPEAKER_17]: It's absolutely they just drove their own HR director out of town.

952
01:12:45,432 --> 01:12:46,092
[SPEAKER_17]: Come on, continue.

953
01:12:46,112 --> 01:12:47,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to continue?

954
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:55,203
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to present, we want to focus on a paper hand and just just narrow the scope.

955
01:12:56,063 --> 01:13:08,270
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, it's challenging to narrow the scope, President Morell, with all due respect, because the council members who speak and go off and out of the scope are the ones who are attempting to hold me responsible to a narrowed scope.

956
01:13:08,742 --> 01:13:25,886
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's challenging to do that and stand here, I'm happy to speak, I'm given the same opportunity to speak, but I won't come to the city council meetings and I won't speak in present, and I'm a nursing mother so I do need to pump on a regular basis so if anyone has a challenge with me not physically being present, it is a challenge for me.

957
01:13:26,427 --> 01:13:43,469
[SPEAKER_18]: So, I'm gonna, I'm happy to come here I'm happy to be here and I'm also happy to speak before all of you and, and actually connected actually give you answers, but I won't be disrespected every time I come here in a way that doesn't allow me to speak but other Councilors can speak in specific Councilor Knight.

958
01:13:44,530 --> 01:13:46,931
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe I'm a Councilor and this is a council meeting.

959
01:13:46,952 --> 01:13:48,932
[SPEAKER_17]: And as a Councilor, I have what they call a bully pulpit.

960
01:13:49,373 --> 01:13:50,493
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, I have that.

961
01:13:50,713 --> 01:13:55,096
[SPEAKER_17]: And that comes with the honor and privilege of being elected to represent the residents in this community.

962
01:13:55,856 --> 01:13:57,357
[SPEAKER_17]: I need 5,000 votes and I got them.

963
01:13:57,757 --> 01:13:59,298
[SPEAKER_17]: She only needs one, the mayor, and that's it.

964
01:13:59,718 --> 01:14:01,559
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, so the only person she reports to is the mayor.

965
01:14:01,879 --> 01:14:04,220
[SPEAKER_17]: But the people that I report to are the taxpayers in this community.

966
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:06,341
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't get in my car and drive to my suburb.

967
01:14:06,581 --> 01:14:09,483
[SPEAKER_13]: I get in my car and I drive- Let's not have this argument again.

968
01:14:09,503 --> 01:14:11,584
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, honestly, we're having a- Please, hang on.

969
01:14:12,144 --> 01:14:20,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Please know, attending via Zoom, when you can attend, one nursing mother to another, I understand how extremely challenging it is.

970
01:14:20,549 --> 01:14:24,971
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been shouted out of this council because I had to leave to pump, so I understand that.

971
01:14:26,352 --> 01:14:29,974
[SPEAKER_03]: So any manner you can attend, if you can attend, I appreciate that.

972
01:14:30,394 --> 01:14:40,360
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that we would much appreciate, or I can speak personally, would much appreciate information in advance so that you don't have to come and defend everything because I don't,

973
01:14:42,434 --> 01:14:45,756
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to put you in that position beforehand is great.

974
01:14:45,836 --> 01:14:48,117
[SPEAKER_03]: So you don't have to go line by line and say, here's what we did.

975
01:14:48,217 --> 01:14:50,919
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's just me speaking as a person.

976
01:14:50,959 --> 01:14:51,619
[SPEAKER_18]: And it sounds good.

977
01:14:51,859 --> 01:14:52,260
[SPEAKER_18]: Sounds good.

978
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:59,524
[SPEAKER_18]: And as far as, you know, this is my last piece, as far as the ARPA information, that information's on our website, that information is available.

979
01:14:59,544 --> 01:15:03,226
[SPEAKER_17]: Does that mean that the administration will not be giving us that report?

980
01:15:03,967 --> 01:15:05,147
[SPEAKER_18]: We can certainly share it.

981
01:15:05,167 --> 01:15:08,189
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we recently sent some information as well, but I may be mistaken.

982
01:15:08,209 --> 01:15:09,230
[SPEAKER_18]: I was on vacation last week.

983
01:15:10,737 --> 01:15:11,057
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

984
01:15:11,077 --> 01:15:12,638
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you all.

985
01:15:12,658 --> 01:15:13,079
[SPEAKER_18]: President Ferris.

986
01:15:13,119 --> 01:15:13,519
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

987
01:15:13,999 --> 01:15:14,820
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Madam Chief of Staff.

988
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:24,626
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to say that I do appreciate what you said about reaching out and sitting down and that you want to have conversations.

989
01:15:24,906 --> 01:15:25,667
[SPEAKER_13]: I appreciate that.

990
01:15:25,727 --> 01:15:30,170
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, I think as one Councilor, I have had some opportunities to do that.

991
01:15:30,710 --> 01:15:34,812
[SPEAKER_13]: However, I just want to also say on the topic at hand,

992
01:15:36,723 --> 01:15:47,228
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a difference between a comprehensive and total charter review, whether by home rule petition or special act or, you know, mass general law provisions and discrete charter amendments.

993
01:15:48,869 --> 01:15:52,190
[SPEAKER_13]: A full review of charter opens up everything in the charter.

994
01:15:52,570 --> 01:15:59,333
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not just the question of this specific question of balance of powers between the mayor and the council.

995
01:16:00,714 --> 01:16:02,655
[SPEAKER_13]: We may not all agree that we should go to word representation,

996
01:16:03,810 --> 01:16:09,301
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight I know for one has very strong thoughts that he kind of likes to play in a form of government that we have right now.

997
01:16:09,321 --> 01:16:11,345
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't want to speak for you Councilor Knight.

998
01:16:16,773 --> 01:16:23,539
[SPEAKER_13]: I do think there's general consensus on a specific and discrete thing probably something that the mayor would have supported sitting here around balance of power.

999
01:16:24,180 --> 01:16:39,494
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's something that be given the authority and the laws that, while a full and comprehensive charter review, certainly won't be effect until January 2026, at best, could be in effect January 2024 around balance of power and looking at that and I think that

1000
01:16:40,154 --> 01:16:42,755
[SPEAKER_13]: sooner than later, in my opinion, is better on that.

1001
01:16:42,875 --> 01:16:45,456
[SPEAKER_13]: So I appreciate you bringing up the full charter review process.

1002
01:16:45,656 --> 01:16:49,358
[SPEAKER_13]: You know that I've voted for it multiple times and strongly support going through a full charter review.

1003
01:16:49,378 --> 01:17:01,202
[SPEAKER_13]: I've actually, you know, I'm sure that members of the charter review committee that the mayor has appointed the ad hoc charter review group probably are saying, what's he talking about doing something before we've had a chance to look at everything?

1004
01:17:01,743 --> 01:17:03,563
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm happy to talk to any members of that committee.

1005
01:17:03,583 --> 01:17:06,985
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm certainly not trying to step on their toes or trying to take

1006
01:17:07,825 --> 01:17:10,307
[SPEAKER_13]: out the idea of doing a comprehensive charter review at some point.

1007
01:17:10,747 --> 01:17:17,052
[SPEAKER_13]: This is just something that this group, which again, Councilor Knight made the very strong point, thousands and thousands of people elected us.

1008
01:17:17,112 --> 01:17:29,562
[SPEAKER_13]: If we can all agree to do something, mass general law says that's good enough to, it's certainly good enough to put on as a non-binding resolution and with the support of the mayor, it's certainly enough to put on the ballot for the voters to make a choice.

1009
01:17:29,622 --> 01:17:31,203
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that's where we should go from here.

1010
01:17:31,844 --> 01:17:34,045
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'll leave it at that.

1011
01:17:35,646 --> 01:17:36,127
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for

1012
01:17:36,913 --> 01:17:39,414
[SPEAKER_13]: bring that up, but I just wanted to clarify that that was my meeting there.

1013
01:17:40,514 --> 01:17:41,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1014
01:17:41,314 --> 01:17:42,215
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President.

1015
01:17:42,275 --> 01:17:45,876
[SPEAKER_06]: So appreciate the chief of staff coming before us.

1016
01:17:47,876 --> 01:17:52,238
[SPEAKER_06]: But what in the past was called bullying.

1017
01:17:53,798 --> 01:18:00,440
[SPEAKER_06]: My, my passion really derives from the understanding I sat beside the mayor.

1018
01:18:01,733 --> 01:18:07,837
[SPEAKER_06]: And we shared different concerns and we shared the lack of transparency for other administrations.

1019
01:18:10,619 --> 01:18:12,981
[SPEAKER_06]: And I supported the mayor when she ran for office.

1020
01:18:15,062 --> 01:18:19,105
[SPEAKER_06]: And what I saw was totally completely opposite of what we talked about.

1021
01:18:19,125 --> 01:18:21,807
[SPEAKER_06]: It was completely opposite of what she ran on.

1022
01:18:24,092 --> 01:18:32,399
[SPEAKER_06]: So our first term, I was very contentious, I was angry, and I called for the meeting with yourself, I don't know if you remember, yourself and the mayor, and we sat together.

1023
01:18:33,660 --> 01:18:43,648
[SPEAKER_06]: And I asked you, tell me if I'm wrong, if I'm lying, I asked you, I asked the mayor, please allow the council to share in the failures and share in the successes.

1024
01:18:44,109 --> 01:18:46,271
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely, that's what we'll say.

1025
01:18:50,190 --> 01:18:54,712
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't gotten a text message from you about what's going on in the community.

1026
01:18:55,073 --> 01:18:59,735
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't heard any outreach from the mayor's office or your office.

1027
01:19:01,036 --> 01:19:15,143
[SPEAKER_06]: The only contact we had that I appreciate was with the last chief of staff accepting thousands of dollars worth of free furniture from the Furniture Trust Company that refurbished many offices in this building.

1028
01:19:16,540 --> 01:19:31,803
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the situation, that same furniture trust company that worked with this yellow office or some office at City Hall to donate more furniture, and then get a phone call from the CEO saying, George, what is this letter that won't be signed?

1029
01:19:32,264 --> 01:19:33,964
[SPEAKER_06]: Which we agreed, we needed us to sign.

1030
01:19:35,644 --> 01:19:38,105
[SPEAKER_06]: With furniture that was already in the building, already being used.

1031
01:19:40,393 --> 01:19:50,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Why is the lack of communication coming from the CEO instead of the chief of staff, knowing that I put my name and my reputation for this organization to come help this community?

1032
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:56,102
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the little things that maybe you don't understand.

1033
01:19:56,863 --> 01:20:01,406
[SPEAKER_06]: You seem to think that it's bullying or it's anger.

1034
01:20:01,586 --> 01:20:03,827
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it is anger because I am passionate.

1035
01:20:07,969 --> 01:20:08,710
[SPEAKER_06]: We are a mess.

1036
01:20:10,267 --> 01:20:11,648
[SPEAKER_06]: There is lack of transparency.

1037
01:20:12,448 --> 01:20:13,348
[SPEAKER_06]: You just said it yourself.

1038
01:20:14,969 --> 01:20:18,851
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess if you're not the president or the vice president, we don't get text messages.

1039
01:20:22,093 --> 01:20:23,253
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's the frustration.

1040
01:20:23,613 --> 01:20:26,235
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I support Councilor Bears's initiative.

1041
01:20:26,855 --> 01:20:31,757
[SPEAKER_06]: As a charter review, at the beginning I did, I voted for it.

1042
01:20:32,738 --> 01:20:38,801
[SPEAKER_05]: And I changed that because the administration that led, that would lead this charter review,

1043
01:20:39,865 --> 01:20:48,868
[SPEAKER_06]: would put the steps in place for what they wanted and that I didn't believe in because I've lost that communication with the mayor.

1044
01:20:49,688 --> 01:20:52,589
[SPEAKER_06]: I lost that professional partnership with the mayor.

1045
01:20:53,829 --> 01:21:00,691
[SPEAKER_06]: So absolutely I voted no to the charter review because I have no faith in the mayor's office that's gonna lead that charter review.

1046
01:21:02,552 --> 01:21:04,312
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I didn't vote for charter review.

1047
01:21:07,113 --> 01:21:07,253
[SPEAKER_06]: So,

1048
01:21:10,905 --> 01:21:11,785
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President.

1049
01:21:11,865 --> 01:21:12,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

1050
01:21:13,766 --> 01:21:14,346
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry.

1051
01:21:19,249 --> 01:21:20,389
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Councilor Scarapelli.

1052
01:21:20,689 --> 01:21:21,530
[SPEAKER_18]: I recall that meeting.

1053
01:21:21,730 --> 01:21:22,810
[SPEAKER_18]: I recall that meeting very well.

1054
01:21:23,230 --> 01:21:28,513
[SPEAKER_18]: I also recall at that time that the mayor had mentioned that there was a matter that was coming up at that time.

1055
01:21:28,553 --> 01:21:34,075
[SPEAKER_18]: If you wanted to serve on a border committee, I know a number of council members on this council have done that.

1056
01:21:34,392 --> 01:21:46,085
[SPEAKER_18]: I know Councilor Tseng has I know Councilor Collins has members of this commit this council are always welcome to serve on task forces to contact us to join and have discussions with us.

1057
01:21:47,557 --> 01:21:55,423
[SPEAKER_18]: you hopefully would also recall the text message exchange that we had that evening with regard to, or that day with regard to the Furniture Trust.

1058
01:21:55,723 --> 01:22:01,327
[SPEAKER_18]: I had only received the agreement from them the day or the days leading up to.

1059
01:22:01,367 --> 01:22:05,891
[SPEAKER_18]: They never told me that an agreement needed to be signed before the furniture was in City Hall.

1060
01:22:06,411 --> 01:22:08,773
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't be responsible for something I wasn't aware of.

1061
01:22:08,793 --> 01:22:11,235
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't, the city can because it was done prior to that.

1062
01:22:15,158 --> 01:22:16,839
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a motion from Councilor Knight to move the question.

1063
01:22:18,081 --> 01:22:20,043
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilors would, what?

1064
01:22:21,304 --> 01:22:23,665
[SPEAKER_03]: Understood, thank you, thank you.

1065
01:22:27,468 --> 01:22:29,690
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1066
01:22:30,671 --> 01:22:31,211
[SPEAKER_03]: That's okay.

1067
01:22:31,792 --> 01:22:32,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Cabrera.

1068
01:22:33,113 --> 01:22:34,354
[SPEAKER_09]: Madam President, thank you.

1069
01:22:36,035 --> 01:22:47,064
[SPEAKER_09]: I served with this mayor for 10 years, and the mayor I served with on this council would never ever accept what is going on here now.

1070
01:22:48,060 --> 01:22:49,801
[SPEAKER_09]: And I value my relationship with the mayor.

1071
01:22:51,341 --> 01:23:07,146
[SPEAKER_09]: I've known the mayor for many, many years and I still maintain a relationship with her and I have the utmost respect for her, but I don't think I've gotten more than two or three calls from the mayor over three years on issues or anything.

1072
01:23:10,067 --> 01:23:10,828
[SPEAKER_09]: Do I feel slighted?

1073
01:23:11,208 --> 01:23:12,048
[SPEAKER_09]: Most certainly I do.

1074
01:23:13,189 --> 01:23:14,429
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm the senior member of this council.

1075
01:23:15,692 --> 01:23:21,296
[SPEAKER_09]: If I have an issue, I come to the mayor, because if I feel it's important, I'll come to her.

1076
01:23:21,977 --> 01:23:30,103
[SPEAKER_09]: But as I said, the mayor I served with for many years would never, never, never accept what is going on here now.

1077
01:23:31,844 --> 01:23:36,648
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's where I feel bad about it.

1078
01:23:36,668 --> 01:23:36,908
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1079
01:23:37,828 --> 01:23:41,131
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion of Vice President Bears, seconded by Councilor Knight.

1080
01:23:41,851 --> 01:23:42,472
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

1081
01:23:42,492 --> 01:23:44,754
[SPEAKER_03]: To refer to Committee of the Whole.

1082
01:23:45,770 --> 01:23:46,431
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor.

1083
01:23:47,152 --> 01:23:47,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

1084
01:23:47,372 --> 01:23:47,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Opposed?

1085
01:23:47,892 --> 01:23:48,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

1086
01:23:50,015 --> 01:23:58,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Communications from the mayor 23-044 to Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council regarding loan order sidewalk construction and equipment bonds.

1087
01:23:58,584 --> 01:24:04,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Dear President Morell and members of the City Council, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve the following loan order.

1088
01:24:04,630 --> 01:24:05,951
[SPEAKER_13]: Madam President, motion to waive the reading.

1089
01:24:07,224 --> 01:24:09,925
[SPEAKER_13]: since it's already been read and in favor of a summary from the commission.

1090
01:24:09,945 --> 01:24:17,167
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion of Vice President Bears to waive the reading as one, it's already been read and also in favor of a summary from DPW Commissioner McGivern, second by?

1091
01:24:17,187 --> 01:24:19,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Second.

1092
01:24:19,767 --> 01:24:21,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli, all those in favor to waive the reading.

1093
01:24:21,848 --> 01:24:23,649
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed, motion passes.

1094
01:24:23,669 --> 01:24:29,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Commissioner McGivern, if you could give us a summary of the loan order requests before us.

1095
01:24:30,330 --> 01:24:33,591
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure, thank you, President Morell, and thank you, our fellow councilors.

1096
01:24:34,111 --> 01:24:35,712
[SPEAKER_16]: Tim McGivern, Commissioner of Public Works.

1097
01:24:36,712 --> 01:24:42,717
[SPEAKER_16]: So before you, the $1.5 million loan, I gave a brief presentation on it last time I was here.

1098
01:24:42,737 --> 01:24:44,218
[SPEAKER_16]: So that really hasn't changed.

1099
01:24:44,598 --> 01:24:52,705
[SPEAKER_16]: This will allow us to continue sidewalk work that I think if it hasn't already started, it will start for this season very soon.

1100
01:24:53,693 --> 01:25:02,079
[SPEAKER_16]: and the passage of this loan will allow us to continue that work once the current contract ends, so without too much delay.

1101
01:25:02,219 --> 01:25:04,880
[SPEAKER_16]: So trying to get ahead of that.

1102
01:25:05,681 --> 01:25:19,570
[SPEAKER_16]: Part of this loan is also equipment, because I think what we heard loud and clear from this council, and in my opinion as well, to try to transition some of the work that we do in-house to better serve our asphalt needs.

1103
01:25:20,287 --> 01:25:23,469
[SPEAKER_16]: As everybody knows and was mentioned tonight, we have a fair amount of potholes.

1104
01:25:24,029 --> 01:25:33,935
[SPEAKER_16]: We have a good pothole operation, but what we're trying to do is transition to more of a permanent patch grind and non overlay.

1105
01:25:34,236 --> 01:25:34,936
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's part of this.

1106
01:25:34,976 --> 01:25:36,817
[SPEAKER_16]: And also that can be used in sidewalks.

1107
01:25:37,137 --> 01:25:39,859
[SPEAKER_16]: The machine we're wanting to get is a smaller paver.

1108
01:25:39,979 --> 01:25:43,121
[SPEAKER_16]: So it would actually be, could be used in sidewalks as well.

1109
01:25:43,381 --> 01:25:46,423
[SPEAKER_16]: And then what is also included is a sidewalk grinder.

1110
01:25:46,643 --> 01:25:48,805
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you remember, I described a,

1111
01:25:49,703 --> 01:25:56,825
[SPEAKER_16]: heave in a sidewalk panel that's less than two inches, that's a lot of our sidewalk defects, to take care of those in-house would be very valuable.

1112
01:25:57,545 --> 01:26:02,066
[SPEAKER_16]: So with that said, it is approximately $275,000 worth of equipment.

1113
01:26:02,146 --> 01:26:11,609
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's a grinder, an asphalt grinder, that's a bigger version than we have now, and a asphalt spreader, a relatively small one, an eight foot wide one.

1114
01:26:12,220 --> 01:26:19,562
[SPEAKER_16]: and then a planer for sidewalks, which is the machine that will take off that two inch lip.

1115
01:26:20,222 --> 01:26:26,784
[SPEAKER_16]: So that is what this loan order is comprised of, and I hope you vote in favor of it tonight.

1116
01:26:27,924 --> 01:26:28,764
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Commissioner McGovern.

1117
01:26:29,444 --> 01:26:30,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Collins.

1118
01:26:31,505 --> 01:26:32,325
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, President Merlin.

1119
01:26:32,722 --> 01:26:35,526
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Commissioner for being here again to speak on this again.

1120
01:26:35,546 --> 01:26:38,871
[SPEAKER_14]: I think this all sounds really reasonable.

1121
01:26:38,891 --> 01:26:44,279
[SPEAKER_14]: One of the things that I hear about from constituents most often is repairs needed on sidewalks.

1122
01:26:45,004 --> 01:26:54,648
[SPEAKER_14]: I think this is something that we all care about a lot because it's an accessibility issue and we need to make sure that, you know, all of our sidewalks in our city are traversable for all residents, no matter how they're getting around.

1123
01:26:54,688 --> 01:27:04,551
[SPEAKER_14]: So for a lot of intuitive reasons, I think this is something that it is important that the city is able to continue moving forward with because this backlog of repairs will only grow and get more expensive over time.

1124
01:27:04,631 --> 01:27:07,453
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm happy to motion for approval for first reading.

1125
01:27:08,273 --> 01:27:08,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1126
01:27:08,773 --> 01:27:09,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Caraviello.

1127
01:27:10,274 --> 01:27:12,174
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1128
01:27:13,035 --> 01:27:13,975
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I asked you last week.

1129
01:27:14,318 --> 01:27:16,900
[SPEAKER_09]: How much money is left over from last year's million dollars that we gave?

1130
01:27:16,920 --> 01:27:22,002
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't have the exact number, but we've about halfway through, I'd say.

1131
01:27:22,022 --> 01:27:28,526
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we basically stopped when the weather got bad and we just picked right back up again.

1132
01:27:28,566 --> 01:27:30,948
[SPEAKER_16]: So we anticipate that contract will be done.

1133
01:27:31,008 --> 01:27:33,929
[SPEAKER_09]: I know I got a late email about the site and never just read.

1134
01:27:34,270 --> 01:27:34,410
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1135
01:27:34,530 --> 01:27:36,571
[SPEAKER_09]: About how many sidewalks got done with half the money?

1136
01:27:36,591 --> 01:27:42,975
[SPEAKER_08]: Approximately

1137
01:27:46,525 --> 01:28:02,516
[SPEAKER_16]: So in the first round, about 34 locations and probably about 45 left.

1138
01:28:04,877 --> 01:28:06,578
[SPEAKER_16]: We fixed 34 sidewalks?

1139
01:28:07,679 --> 01:28:08,920
[SPEAKER_16]: Locations, yes.

1140
01:28:10,101 --> 01:28:11,422
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, we get about 45 left.

1141
01:28:11,442 --> 01:28:14,644
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's what's the list is the first round and second round.

1142
01:28:16,786 --> 01:28:17,647
[SPEAKER_09]: and we get 45 left?

1143
01:28:17,767 --> 01:28:19,970
[SPEAKER_09]: Approximately.

1144
01:28:19,990 --> 01:28:26,917
[SPEAKER_09]: So will the money that was left over from last year cover the next 45?

1145
01:28:27,298 --> 01:28:28,139
[SPEAKER_16]: It should, yes.

1146
01:28:28,199 --> 01:28:33,925
[SPEAKER_16]: So what we have here is the second round that's already, we're working with the contractor to line those up.

1147
01:28:35,326 --> 01:28:38,109
[SPEAKER_16]: So a million dollars only gets us

1148
01:28:39,385 --> 01:28:39,885
[SPEAKER_16]: 90 sidewalks?

1149
01:28:40,585 --> 01:28:43,786
[SPEAKER_16]: No, that was, I believe it was a million over two years.

1150
01:28:44,047 --> 01:28:46,507
[SPEAKER_16]: So this is the second year of it.

1151
01:28:47,468 --> 01:28:49,848
[SPEAKER_16]: But a million dollars gets us 90 sidewalks?

1152
01:28:51,209 --> 01:28:52,229
[SPEAKER_16]: Each location is different.

1153
01:28:52,249 --> 01:28:57,851
[SPEAKER_16]: So sometimes it's one panel, sometimes it's a string of panels, sometimes it's multiple locations on the same street.

1154
01:28:59,115 --> 01:29:01,637
[SPEAKER_16]: You can see like, for example, just pulling one out.

1155
01:29:01,917 --> 01:29:04,438
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't have the opportunity to read the- Yeah, that's okay.

1156
01:29:04,458 --> 01:29:06,840
[SPEAKER_16]: Like cabin concrete panel at utility pole, north of driveway.

1157
01:29:06,860 --> 01:29:09,321
[SPEAKER_16]: So it goes into specifics about each one.

1158
01:29:09,381 --> 01:29:16,385
[SPEAKER_16]: So this is basically addressing defects in the sidewalk.

1159
01:29:16,425 --> 01:29:23,490
[SPEAKER_16]: And one of the reasons I'm trying to transition more in-house work, because it's more cost effective, but without having the,

1160
01:29:24,900 --> 01:29:31,661
[SPEAKER_16]: the in-house team in place ready to go, the best option is to try to do both.

1161
01:29:31,801 --> 01:29:44,324
[SPEAKER_16]: So to contract sidewalk repair, as well as getting our in-house team the right equipment and the right bodies, which is part of a bigger strategy to continue to do more work in-house.

1162
01:29:44,344 --> 01:29:45,304
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a better use of money.

1163
01:29:45,324 --> 01:29:50,665
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so a million dollars last year got us a hundred plus sidewalks, I'll say, right?

1164
01:29:53,138 --> 01:29:56,159
[SPEAKER_09]: is a million and a half and how many sidewalks do we have planned for that money?

1165
01:30:00,541 --> 01:30:04,022
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know the number off the top of my head, but we'll have to, we plan it out.

1166
01:30:04,062 --> 01:30:06,764
[SPEAKER_16]: So we have a list of, you know, hundreds of side locations.

1167
01:30:06,804 --> 01:30:09,244
[SPEAKER_16]: I know the list is nonstop.

1168
01:30:09,285 --> 01:30:11,766
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, you can never, you know, they can work day and night.

1169
01:30:12,726 --> 01:30:14,006
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely, yes.

1170
01:30:14,427 --> 01:30:20,469
[SPEAKER_16]: So we could just keep going, figure somewhere between one and $3,000 per location.

1171
01:30:21,249 --> 01:30:22,830
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's what you end up getting.

1172
01:30:24,807 --> 01:30:24,947
[SPEAKER_16]: Yep.

1173
01:30:27,309 --> 01:30:27,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, go ahead.

1174
01:30:28,169 --> 01:30:28,890
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President.

1175
01:30:30,431 --> 01:30:40,657
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, thank Tim, because I know that he's putting forth an initiative that I've been asking for since I joined the council, and that's having our own hot top and sidewalk crew.

1176
01:30:40,677 --> 01:30:46,221
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that would save us millions of dollars over years.

1177
01:30:46,962 --> 01:30:50,864
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, Tim and I talked, and it's not personal, I think that,

1178
01:30:52,887 --> 01:31:07,873
[SPEAKER_06]: the way that we're receiving papers and not understanding the budget, not seeing a capital plan, I think to me would be, is why I won't be voting for any money paper, unless it's time sensitive.

1179
01:31:08,173 --> 01:31:09,993
[SPEAKER_06]: And right now this isn't time sensitive.

1180
01:31:10,154 --> 01:31:20,277
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that, I think we've been going through the slippery slope without legal representation guiding the council.

1181
01:31:22,373 --> 01:31:24,634
[SPEAKER_06]: Attorney General did respond with the phone call.

1182
01:31:26,134 --> 01:31:28,855
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clark, is that correct?

1183
01:31:29,375 --> 01:31:35,137
[SPEAKER_06]: And in essence, the result was talk to your city solicitor.

1184
01:31:36,577 --> 01:31:45,239
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe that's exactly what the Attorney General's office representing the state said, you need to talk to your own city solicitor.

1185
01:31:45,919 --> 01:31:48,960
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, these are issues that I think

1186
01:31:51,935 --> 01:31:58,799
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless it's not time sensitive, I think this council has to be very cognizant of what we're approving.

1187
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:20,151
[SPEAKER_06]: As a matter of fact, I'm gonna make a motion as well that we ask for copies of all of the signed ordinances from the attorneys making it a legal document that is specific that we've worked on because what

1188
01:32:21,767 --> 01:32:27,933
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said, I've had the ability to talk to former city solicitors and other communities and these are questions I can ask.

1189
01:32:28,634 --> 01:32:43,849
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're under the understanding that we should really get notification whether all the work that we've done, and all the money they put into that, that we've asked them to put in that the bottom line is somebody signs that to make that official.

1190
01:32:44,707 --> 01:32:51,650
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's not signed, all the work and the money we spent for them and all the work and time we spent in this room was all for naught.

1191
01:32:52,591 --> 01:33:02,935
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm gonna request the administration give us a copy of the signed ordinances that we've sent to KP Law with their signatures making it a legal ordinance.

1192
01:33:04,616 --> 01:33:10,299
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, believe me, I despise being that person on this council.

1193
01:33:11,842 --> 01:33:15,365
[SPEAKER_06]: I despise it, it's one of the reasons why I ran, because I hated it.

1194
01:33:16,425 --> 01:33:27,053
[SPEAKER_06]: But unfortunately, like I said, and I thank Tim for understanding, my dad said, at 14, when you open this checking account, we're gonna put $100 in it.

1195
01:33:28,074 --> 01:33:30,636
[SPEAKER_06]: If something costs $101, you can't buy it.

1196
01:33:31,757 --> 01:33:34,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if we can't see what's truly coming in front of us,

1197
01:33:35,832 --> 01:33:37,293
[SPEAKER_06]: we're making decisions without knowing.

1198
01:33:38,013 --> 01:33:48,917
[SPEAKER_06]: This would be great if we all vote for new equipment, and then we come to find out that we don't know if we have enough for staffing to put people in that equipment.

1199
01:33:48,937 --> 01:33:55,219
[SPEAKER_06]: So all we're gonna have is hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of planters that grind in one place.

1200
01:33:56,060 --> 01:34:01,982
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm just a little, again, this is why I'll be voting no, but this is what,

1201
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:05,725
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll express until we get the answers we need.

1202
01:34:05,785 --> 01:34:06,867
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you, Madam President.

1203
01:34:11,035 --> 01:34:14,242
[SPEAKER_12]: I was gonna make the point, but I believe that you were gonna answer something.

1204
01:34:15,177 --> 01:34:16,858
[SPEAKER_16]: I was going to ask President Morales if I could respond.

1205
01:34:16,978 --> 01:34:17,138
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1206
01:34:17,358 --> 01:34:17,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry.

1207
01:34:18,918 --> 01:34:19,879
[SPEAKER_16]: I have put a lot of thought into this.

1208
01:34:20,379 --> 01:34:27,822
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think, you know, we have a team right now that does potholes almost every single day.

1209
01:34:28,602 --> 01:34:32,243
[SPEAKER_16]: So the idea is transition as opposed to brand new crew.

1210
01:34:32,604 --> 01:34:41,447
[SPEAKER_16]: So what I'd like them to do is spend some of that pothole time doing larger cutouts and patches, which is they need they need this equipment in order to do that.

1211
01:34:41,887 --> 01:34:48,209
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's an incremental approach when we're talking about building up our capacity in-house.

1212
01:34:48,649 --> 01:35:02,554
[SPEAKER_16]: So I have strategies in my own mind for what I'd like to see, but this is something that I've discussed and coordinated with the highway department to make sure that we're not buying equipment that's just going to sit around.

1213
01:35:02,994 --> 01:35:05,995
[SPEAKER_16]: So I want to make that point clear.

1214
01:35:06,015 --> 01:35:10,337
[SPEAKER_16]: I wouldn't want to come here and ask for equipment that's just going to sit in the garage.

1215
01:35:10,797 --> 01:35:32,670
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate that, but again, like I said, Tim, and I appreciate your hard work, but again, if we don't know the climate that's ahead of us, the last director stood in front of us at previous budget meetings that said we're devastatingly low or short for what is passable capacity of employees at DPW.

1216
01:35:33,662 --> 01:35:49,352
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that's when we have to look at, without knowing or understanding the budget, like I said, I know the finance director came up, who by the way, I'm a little confused about that too, because it's the same software that's being used under Leish Anomaly, correct?

1217
01:35:50,906 --> 01:36:04,051
[SPEAKER_06]: The software that was used under Aleesha Nunley that gave us all the reports that the mayor as a city councilor asked for, that was given in a timely fashion is the same software that our finance director right now is using, I believe.

1218
01:36:04,652 --> 01:36:06,152
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe the chief of staff can answer that too.

1219
01:36:06,172 --> 01:36:07,613
[SPEAKER_03]: The finance director is on the call too.

1220
01:36:07,633 --> 01:36:14,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, maybe we can ask him that because the previous finance director didn't use a software as an excuse.

1221
01:36:15,276 --> 01:36:20,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything we asked for is money papers to keep us involved and knowledgeable to make these decisions Tim,

1222
01:36:20,734 --> 01:36:21,594
[SPEAKER_06]: we received.

1223
01:36:22,354 --> 01:36:27,096
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, this is why, again, maybe it's the seat.

1224
01:36:27,376 --> 01:36:33,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it's the seat that turned you into somebody you don't wanna be, but I can't support it.

1225
01:36:33,197 --> 01:36:34,038
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, thank you.

1226
01:36:34,618 --> 01:36:40,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Director Dickinson, can you answer that question as far as, is it the same software that was under the previous finance director that you're using?

1227
01:36:42,080 --> 01:36:42,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it is.

1228
01:36:44,981 --> 01:36:49,822
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a question of getting, it's a question of time.

1229
01:36:50,525 --> 01:36:51,985
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a question of resources.

1230
01:36:52,766 --> 01:36:58,788
[SPEAKER_04]: And obviously, the previous finance director was on the job for much longer than I have been.

1231
01:36:59,668 --> 01:37:06,010
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a lot of knowledge that I need to accumulate in order to get you the reports that you need.

1232
01:37:07,450 --> 01:37:09,191
[SPEAKER_06]: I completely understand that.

1233
01:37:09,611 --> 01:37:14,372
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe the chief of staff mentioned that as a software as part of this problem why this isn't happening.

1234
01:37:15,033 --> 01:37:16,593
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just want to make sure that's clear.

1235
01:37:17,733 --> 01:37:18,374
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you.

1236
01:37:19,234 --> 01:37:19,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1237
01:37:20,320 --> 01:37:20,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Tseng.

1238
01:37:21,130 --> 01:37:21,332
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1239
01:37:22,675 --> 01:37:27,116
[SPEAKER_12]: I just, I wanted to get across my way of thinking with this in front of me tonight.

1240
01:37:27,596 --> 01:37:40,019
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we've discussed a lot about our approach to money papers coming in front of us and generally how we maybe agree to disagree on how we kind of treat these papers.

1241
01:37:40,079 --> 01:37:50,462
[SPEAKER_12]: For me personally, I am pretty concerned with the state of the sidewalks as is and concerned with quality of life here in Medford.

1242
01:37:53,162 --> 01:38:15,616
[SPEAKER_12]: I, I understand the frustrations that perhaps, you know, with the previous loan order we've only done x, x amount of sidewalks but I would also be very skeptical and you might be able to confirm this I'd be skeptical that cost goes down in the future if we keep holding out and waiting, just because of inflation because of rising costs in general for projects like this.

1243
01:38:16,336 --> 01:38:36,656
[SPEAKER_12]: And so with, with the problem at hand, you know, it's, it's, if it's not going to be cheaper to solve it over time, it makes sense for me to make the investments now in, in terms of the cost effective, the more cost effective solutions that I think you've been pretty transparent with us that you plan for.

1244
01:38:39,065 --> 01:38:42,808
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we all kind of we all agree that sidewalks are a priority here.

1245
01:38:42,848 --> 01:38:49,172
[SPEAKER_12]: It's, I, you know, we disagree on many issues but this is one of one of the many issues I think almost everyone in the city can agree on.

1246
01:38:51,087 --> 01:38:55,650
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we also agree with the approach that bringing things in-house will be more cost effective.

1247
01:38:55,670 --> 01:38:57,171
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the evidence is out there.

1248
01:38:57,211 --> 01:39:09,659
[SPEAKER_12]: And so for me, this is a question of, you know, fiscally, I think it makes more sense in the long run to invest in the resources and the technology we need to bring things in-house.

1249
01:39:10,919 --> 01:39:15,862
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think it sounds like you would agree with that perspective on the issue as well.

1250
01:39:17,283 --> 01:39:21,586
[SPEAKER_12]: And another kind of way that I think about it is, you know, if we hold out on this, right?

1251
01:39:23,827 --> 01:39:25,008
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, what are the consequences?

1252
01:39:25,108 --> 01:39:32,853
[SPEAKER_12]: And it sounded like from previous meetings that because of supply chain issues, and we see this with fire trucks as well, will take a longer time.

1253
01:39:34,319 --> 01:39:36,761
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not just we put in the order, we get the equipment.

1254
01:39:37,982 --> 01:39:39,983
[SPEAKER_12]: We have to wait a certain amount of time.

1255
01:39:40,023 --> 01:39:42,304
[SPEAKER_12]: And we've already been waiting and waiting and waiting.

1256
01:39:42,324 --> 01:39:44,145
[SPEAKER_12]: The city's been waiting, the residents have been waiting.

1257
01:39:45,286 --> 01:39:52,070
[SPEAKER_12]: And so for me, it does seem like a matter of urgency and accessibility, right?

1258
01:39:52,370 --> 01:39:53,771
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't want someone tripping and falling.

1259
01:39:53,811 --> 01:39:55,713
[SPEAKER_12]: We want people to be able to move around town.

1260
01:39:55,953 --> 01:40:02,517
[SPEAKER_12]: And if we keep waiting on it, not only is the problem gonna be more expensive to deal with, we're gonna have more people hindered

1261
01:40:03,173 --> 01:40:04,234
[SPEAKER_12]: in their transportation as well.

1262
01:40:05,494 --> 01:40:05,875
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd agree.

1263
01:40:05,895 --> 01:40:09,757
[SPEAKER_16]: Through the chair, I think just a couple of points in response.

1264
01:40:10,377 --> 01:40:11,518
[SPEAKER_16]: You are exactly right.

1265
01:40:11,598 --> 01:40:14,820
[SPEAKER_16]: So there's increases in cost in two categories mainly.

1266
01:40:15,460 --> 01:40:24,206
[SPEAKER_16]: One is the longer it sits in disrepair, the more damage it gets because water gets in, freezes and thaws and makes the damage worse.

1267
01:40:24,246 --> 01:40:24,686
[SPEAKER_16]: So you may

1268
01:40:25,205 --> 01:40:33,635
[SPEAKER_16]: have a two inch lip or one inch lip that gets heaved one year but we could have repaired it with say that sidewalk line to the previous years and sealed it.

1269
01:40:34,729 --> 01:40:41,774
[SPEAKER_16]: So there's that, and then there's also inflation, cost of fuel, cost of labor, all of that is going up.

1270
01:40:42,274 --> 01:40:43,755
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's really a twofold increase.

1271
01:40:44,576 --> 01:40:49,759
[SPEAKER_16]: And another important point I think everybody really needs to understand citywide is that this isn't going away.

1272
01:40:49,899 --> 01:40:57,624
[SPEAKER_16]: We are going to need to spend some portion of money through a contract to continue sidewalk repairs because we have so many of them.

1273
01:40:58,425 --> 01:40:59,506
[SPEAKER_16]: We also are looking at

1274
01:41:00,548 --> 01:41:02,811
[SPEAKER_16]: increasing in-house capacity to help with that.

1275
01:41:03,192 --> 01:41:06,277
[SPEAKER_16]: We also need to look at more production work.

1276
01:41:06,377 --> 01:41:12,345
[SPEAKER_16]: So what we're trying to do with this particular loan is get away from spot repairs.

1277
01:41:12,466 --> 01:41:14,989
[SPEAKER_16]: And we tried to do this before too, and we're heading in this direction.

1278
01:41:15,490 --> 01:41:19,112
[SPEAKER_16]: We did a pavement management evaluation, including sidewalks.

1279
01:41:19,453 --> 01:41:24,276
[SPEAKER_16]: So we have GIS locations of our sidewalk obstructions and defects.

1280
01:41:24,696 --> 01:41:33,902
[SPEAKER_16]: And we also have somebody working on in my office now, taking our master list and putting location markers on them so we can upload those to the GIS system.

1281
01:41:34,396 --> 01:41:41,081
[SPEAKER_16]: So when we're looking at this money, we want to look at mobilizing a crew as least as possible.

1282
01:41:41,561 --> 01:41:49,927
[SPEAKER_16]: So the way it used to be been done was pick the locations on the list, mobilize here, mobilize there, mobilize there, or you're wasting money in mobilization.

1283
01:41:50,507 --> 01:41:56,812
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you can do a whole block at one time, you just saved yourself all that mobilization, right?

1284
01:41:57,432 --> 01:41:59,754
[SPEAKER_16]: So there's a, I think there's a,

1285
01:42:00,315 --> 01:42:06,502
[SPEAKER_16]: strategic thinking that's happening now that we have the data to do that with that we didn't have before.

1286
01:42:07,203 --> 01:42:11,689
[SPEAKER_16]: So, this isn't the last loan that we're going to be asking for from this Council for sidewalk work.

1287
01:42:12,636 --> 01:42:20,561
[SPEAKER_16]: But it is one of the first loans where the approach and the strategy is such that I believe we'll be making a better, efficient use of the money.

1288
01:42:20,801 --> 01:42:33,448
[SPEAKER_16]: Because doing 100 sidewalk locations, give or take, for the half a million dollars or whatever it was, that is getting better than what we used to do, but there's room for improvement.

1289
01:42:33,668 --> 01:42:35,669
[SPEAKER_16]: And my job is to continue improving that.

1290
01:42:36,709 --> 01:42:40,192
[SPEAKER_16]: So, you know, we have more of the tools to do that now.

1291
01:42:40,852 --> 01:42:49,558
[SPEAKER_16]: But I guarantee you, moving forward, the city is going to need to do both contract sidewalk repairs and road repairs and in-house sidewalk repairs.

1292
01:42:49,578 --> 01:42:51,599
[SPEAKER_16]: We have to do both, really, to succeed.

1293
01:42:52,777 --> 01:43:00,601
[SPEAKER_12]: Right, we can't, even though it might be more cost effective to do things in-house, it's unrealistic to assume that, you know, we can just do it overnight.

1294
01:43:01,201 --> 01:43:01,441
[SPEAKER_16]: Correct.

1295
01:43:01,481 --> 01:43:09,865
[SPEAKER_16]: And also think about if we fix everything all at once and we have an in-house crew and everything's all fixed, then we have an in-house crew that we then, we have to figure out what to do with them after that.

1296
01:43:09,925 --> 01:43:13,747
[SPEAKER_16]: So there's a balance there as well, but we're talking over long spans of time, decades.

1297
01:43:14,187 --> 01:43:15,128
[SPEAKER_16]: So, you know,

1298
01:43:16,088 --> 01:43:24,470
[SPEAKER_16]: When we think about this stuff, when we talk about this stuff in my office, we talk about it in decades because these are the life of our investments that we're talking about.

1299
01:43:24,530 --> 01:43:26,370
[SPEAKER_16]: Our water pipes, for example, last 100 years.

1300
01:43:26,790 --> 01:43:29,451
[SPEAKER_16]: So we need to immediately do something now.

1301
01:43:29,531 --> 01:43:31,151
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, we're talking about it in the next decade.

1302
01:43:31,271 --> 01:43:33,131
[SPEAKER_16]: That's immediate for like a water pipe.

1303
01:43:33,452 --> 01:43:34,212
[SPEAKER_16]: Same with sidewalks.

1304
01:43:34,232 --> 01:43:36,692
[SPEAKER_16]: Sidewalks have been around for bottom 100 years.

1305
01:43:37,152 --> 01:43:39,553
[SPEAKER_16]: So that has to be a part of the consideration.

1306
01:43:40,293 --> 01:43:40,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.

1307
01:43:41,393 --> 01:43:41,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1308
01:43:41,693 --> 01:43:42,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Caraviello.

1309
01:43:43,434 --> 01:43:44,174
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Madam President.

1310
01:43:44,554 --> 01:43:45,414
[SPEAKER_09]: We talked about earlier,

1311
01:43:46,504 --> 01:43:47,905
[SPEAKER_09]: This should be part of the capital plan.

1312
01:43:50,146 --> 01:43:51,667
[SPEAKER_09]: This is what we've talked about.

1313
01:43:51,687 --> 01:43:54,188
[SPEAKER_09]: This is another piecemeal approach.

1314
01:43:56,390 --> 01:43:57,270
[SPEAKER_09]: Does this need to be done?

1315
01:43:58,351 --> 01:44:04,234
[SPEAKER_09]: Most certainly, and I'm really sitting here torn on how I'm going to vote for this thing.

1316
01:44:04,955 --> 01:44:07,856
[SPEAKER_09]: I know you need it, and I know it needs to be done, but I also know that

1317
01:44:10,852 --> 01:44:11,873
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree with my other Councilors.

1318
01:44:12,213 --> 01:44:18,835
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to know what our financial status is before we keep voting on these things.

1319
01:44:18,895 --> 01:44:20,255
[SPEAKER_09]: That's really what the issue is.

1320
01:44:20,495 --> 01:44:21,755
[SPEAKER_09]: No one's saying that we don't need this.

1321
01:44:22,356 --> 01:44:22,876
[SPEAKER_09]: We need it.

1322
01:44:23,196 --> 01:44:24,096
[SPEAKER_09]: And you're right.

1323
01:44:24,896 --> 01:44:27,137
[SPEAKER_09]: But can we afford it?

1324
01:44:27,577 --> 01:44:29,378
[SPEAKER_09]: That's really what the bottom line is.

1325
01:44:30,078 --> 01:44:33,979
[SPEAKER_09]: This should have been part of a capital plan so we know where we're going.

1326
01:44:34,995 --> 01:44:41,678
[SPEAKER_16]: I just, through the chair, I have submitted these pieces of equipment on the DPW's recommendation for capital improvement plan.

1327
01:44:42,179 --> 01:44:44,100
[SPEAKER_16]: I know that that doesn't mean that you've seen it.

1328
01:44:44,160 --> 01:44:46,741
[SPEAKER_16]: It just means that- We haven't seen it.

1329
01:44:47,081 --> 01:44:47,421
[SPEAKER_16]: Right, right.

1330
01:44:47,681 --> 01:44:49,242
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just assuring you that- We haven't seen it.

1331
01:44:50,643 --> 01:44:53,104
[SPEAKER_16]: But I'm just assuring you- I mean, I'd like to see it someday.

1332
01:44:53,264 --> 01:44:55,685
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, I do have a plan and it was- And I'm sure you do.

1333
01:44:55,705 --> 01:44:57,947
[SPEAKER_16]: Integrated into the CIP, so- I'm sure you have a plan.

1334
01:44:58,027 --> 01:45:00,588
[SPEAKER_16]: Understood, but I'm just- And I say, you're not wrong.

1335
01:45:00,648 --> 01:45:03,549
[SPEAKER_09]: I say, I'm sitting here kind of torn tonight.

1336
01:45:05,333 --> 01:45:10,774
[SPEAKER_09]: As a Councilor, I think I should vote for this because the city needs it, but as a responsible Councilor, I don't know.

1337
01:45:10,794 --> 01:45:14,175
[SPEAKER_17]: Point taken, I hope you do.

1338
01:45:14,635 --> 01:45:15,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Any further discussion?

1339
01:45:15,756 --> 01:45:16,456
[SPEAKER_17]: Madam President, if I may.

1340
01:45:16,776 --> 01:45:17,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight.

1341
01:45:18,336 --> 01:45:24,478
[SPEAKER_17]: Tim, this is a paper that I think you're well aware I've supported in the past, I've led debates on in the past in support of it.

1342
01:45:25,698 --> 01:45:30,659
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's something that we need, as Councilor Caraviello said, and I too share the same concerns that he has.

1343
01:45:31,019 --> 01:45:33,260
[SPEAKER_17]: I know the city needs it, but as someone

1344
01:45:34,602 --> 01:45:47,367
[SPEAKER_17]: who's very concerned about the lack of fiscal transparency and financial constraint that we have in the city, about our administration's inability to provide us with simple documentation as to where they're spending their money.

1345
01:45:47,667 --> 01:45:51,288
[SPEAKER_17]: And we've been waiting since January of 2020 to get that and still haven't received it.

1346
01:45:53,189 --> 01:45:55,090
[SPEAKER_17]: Speaks volumes, speaks volumes.

1347
01:45:55,230 --> 01:45:58,251
[SPEAKER_17]: Everybody says when you can't get an answer to something, you follow the money.

1348
01:45:59,011 --> 01:46:01,032
[SPEAKER_17]: And for three years, I've been trying to follow the money.

1349
01:46:02,196 --> 01:46:03,056
[SPEAKER_17]: and I'm getting stonewalled.

1350
01:46:03,556 --> 01:46:08,558
[SPEAKER_17]: And I don't know why, I don't know why, but it leads me to believe that there's something strange going on.

1351
01:46:09,618 --> 01:46:11,739
[SPEAKER_17]: The fish is rotting in Denmark or whatever they say, right?

1352
01:46:12,179 --> 01:46:15,140
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, I think you're doing an excellent job and I think you've done a great job with that department.

1353
01:46:15,700 --> 01:46:18,821
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think you've really moved it ahead, all right?

1354
01:46:19,141 --> 01:46:24,983
[SPEAKER_17]: And my vote this evening has nothing to do with you, with the job you're doing or with the department you run.

1355
01:46:26,523 --> 01:46:29,364
[SPEAKER_17]: My job really has to do with the fact that, you know, the first day,

1356
01:46:30,542 --> 01:46:35,324
[SPEAKER_17]: of January, when we all stood behind this rail, the first thing that we did was we raised our right hand.

1357
01:46:35,984 --> 01:46:44,548
[SPEAKER_17]: And we raised our right hand and we said that we're gonna do our best to uphold the Constitution in the United States of America, the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the ordinances in the city of Medford.

1358
01:46:45,548 --> 01:46:48,189
[SPEAKER_17]: So we sit here and we look at this paper that's before us and it's a loan order.

1359
01:46:48,549 --> 01:46:49,930
[SPEAKER_17]: So this is a loan order, it needs five votes.

1360
01:46:52,703 --> 01:46:53,223
[SPEAKER_17]: per state law.

1361
01:46:54,104 --> 01:47:01,627
[SPEAKER_17]: Pursuant to city ordinances, the city shall have a city solicitor, and the city solicitor is responsible for reviewing all legal instruments, a loan owner being one.

1362
01:47:02,327 --> 01:47:03,348
[SPEAKER_17]: We have no city solicitor.

1363
01:47:03,968 --> 01:47:07,010
[SPEAKER_17]: So we have no city solicitor that's here that works for the people of this city.

1364
01:47:07,530 --> 01:47:15,874
[SPEAKER_17]: We have a private law firm that's already come forward and said they work for the administration, but we have no attorney or solicitor for this community that works for the people of this community.

1365
01:47:15,894 --> 01:47:19,375
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, and that's been stated by legal counsel that we're paying.

1366
01:47:19,655 --> 01:47:20,576
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know how much we're paying them,

1367
01:47:21,885 --> 01:47:24,007
[SPEAKER_17]: Some have set up to $2.7 million.

1368
01:47:25,348 --> 01:47:27,830
[SPEAKER_17]: KP law has been paid so far this year.

1369
01:47:28,930 --> 01:47:29,451
[SPEAKER_17]: That's a lot of money.

1370
01:47:29,471 --> 01:47:30,372
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know if it's true or not.

1371
01:47:30,712 --> 01:47:35,055
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd love to know if it is or not, because I've been asking for the paperwork to look at it, but I just can't seem to get my hands on it.

1372
01:47:35,836 --> 01:47:38,798
[SPEAKER_17]: So ultimately, you know, we have a lack of fiscal transparency.

1373
01:47:39,418 --> 01:47:46,164
[SPEAKER_17]: We have an administration that comes forward for job classification changes every other week to create new positions and give certain and select individuals raises.

1374
01:47:46,804 --> 01:47:50,307
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, so when I'm sitting down and I want to look at the full financial picture of this community and what's going on,

1375
01:47:51,228 --> 01:47:54,190
[SPEAKER_17]: And I wanna say to myself, this is where the money's going and this is where it's being spent.

1376
01:47:54,910 --> 01:47:55,450
[SPEAKER_17]: I can't do that.

1377
01:47:56,291 --> 01:48:03,714
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's very difficult for me to sit down and take a vote for $1.5 million of borrowing.

1378
01:48:04,215 --> 01:48:05,395
[SPEAKER_17]: This isn't our money that we're spending.

1379
01:48:05,435 --> 01:48:08,277
[SPEAKER_17]: This is money that we're asking somebody to give us that we're gonna have to pay back.

1380
01:48:09,337 --> 01:48:11,098
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, so it's very concerning to me.

1381
01:48:12,939 --> 01:48:15,180
[SPEAKER_17]: I feel like you're a sacrificial lamb sometimes when you come down here.

1382
01:48:15,500 --> 01:48:18,322
[SPEAKER_17]: I know that you're working with one hand behind your back and I know that this stuff would be helpful.

1383
01:48:18,882 --> 01:48:20,583
[SPEAKER_17]: But I also know that as

1384
01:48:22,633 --> 01:48:29,856
[SPEAKER_17]: a financial stalwart for the taxpayers of this community, the people in the city deserve better.

1385
01:48:30,277 --> 01:48:36,940
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's very difficult for me to take a vote where I'm not confident that it complies with the ordinances in our community.

1386
01:48:37,960 --> 01:48:43,043
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm not so certain as to what our actual fiscal picture is right now.

1387
01:48:43,583 --> 01:48:45,244
[SPEAKER_17]: It makes it very difficult for me to make this vote.

1388
01:48:45,924 --> 01:48:46,764
[SPEAKER_17]: And I know what's gonna happen.

1389
01:48:47,105 --> 01:48:50,066
[SPEAKER_17]: The next time somebody calls the mayor's office and they say, I need my sidewalk fixed.

1390
01:48:50,126 --> 01:48:52,107
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, the city council voted against the money, so you just got the way.

1391
01:48:53,369 --> 01:48:54,270
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what it's gonna be, right?

1392
01:48:54,310 --> 01:48:59,673
[SPEAKER_17]: Because it's not about governance, it's about politics, right?

1393
01:49:00,454 --> 01:49:01,334
[SPEAKER_17]: We went over this already.

1394
01:49:01,795 --> 01:49:03,176
[SPEAKER_17]: It's about politics, not governance.

1395
01:49:04,196 --> 01:49:07,158
[SPEAKER_17]: Governance versus politics is a big difference.

1396
01:49:08,419 --> 01:49:11,161
[SPEAKER_17]: So for those reasons, I can't support the paper this evening.

1397
01:49:11,801 --> 01:49:14,683
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd like to see a table for 90 days and maybe we can take it back up in June.

1398
01:49:16,967 --> 01:49:19,909
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a motion on the floor from Councilor Collins to approve the first reading.

1399
01:49:19,989 --> 01:49:20,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Caraviello.

1400
01:49:20,990 --> 01:49:21,610
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Madam President.

1401
01:49:21,911 --> 01:49:30,757
[SPEAKER_09]: So we got an email late this afternoon saying that we have 25 plus million dollars in free cashes.

1402
01:49:32,198 --> 01:49:33,319
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that correct?

1403
01:49:34,400 --> 01:49:34,780
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

1404
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:38,683
[SPEAKER_09]: We got an email earlier today that we have 25 plus million dollars cash.

1405
01:49:38,723 --> 01:49:38,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1406
01:49:40,144 --> 01:49:44,207
[SPEAKER_09]: Why are we gonna borrow a million dollars at probably five or six or 7%

1407
01:49:45,974 --> 01:49:47,056
[SPEAKER_09]: when we have the money here.

1408
01:49:48,818 --> 01:49:51,782
[SPEAKER_09]: I would think this would be a reasonable thing to take out of free cash.

1409
01:49:55,006 --> 01:49:55,788
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't have an answer.

1410
01:49:56,108 --> 01:50:03,078
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that's no, that's not your decision, but you know, with the interest rates being the way they are in the banking, you know, the finances, you know,

1411
01:50:05,807 --> 01:50:09,329
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe you can answer why we're not taking this out of free cash.

1412
01:50:09,549 --> 01:50:12,010
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm under the weather, so you may want to just go a little bit further.

1413
01:50:12,150 --> 01:50:13,691
[SPEAKER_18]: Not COVID, but still sick.

1414
01:50:15,052 --> 01:50:15,352
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1415
01:50:15,852 --> 01:50:16,752
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, I'll try.

1416
01:50:18,073 --> 01:50:22,255
[SPEAKER_18]: I just wanted to ask President Morell that you defer to our finance director.

1417
01:50:22,555 --> 01:50:31,680
[SPEAKER_18]: My introductory comments on this, Councilor Caraviello, are essentially that we have a finite amount of funds in terms of

1418
01:50:33,833 --> 01:50:40,595
[SPEAKER_18]: the available dollars in free cash, and we can't keep going to that well for $1 million, $1 million, $1 million for street sidewalks.

1419
01:50:40,955 --> 01:50:43,355
[SPEAKER_18]: Those are items that are long-term capital costs.

1420
01:50:43,375 --> 01:50:50,077
[SPEAKER_18]: They have long-term capital lives, so to speak, and that's perfect for capital improvements plan.

1421
01:50:50,097 --> 01:50:51,677
[SPEAKER_18]: But again, don't take it from me.

1422
01:50:51,717 --> 01:50:52,758
[SPEAKER_18]: Take it from our finance director.

1423
01:50:52,798 --> 01:50:55,218
[SPEAKER_18]: I just ask that you ask for his commentary on this.

1424
01:50:55,518 --> 01:50:55,698
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1425
01:50:55,718 --> 01:50:57,079
[SPEAKER_18]: Director Dickinson, can you?

1426
01:50:57,199 --> 01:50:58,799
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Chief Esteves is here.

1427
01:50:59,279 --> 01:51:01,720
[SPEAKER_06]: Would ARPA funding fall into this category

1428
01:51:03,958 --> 01:51:05,559
[SPEAKER_06]: with what could that have worked?

1429
01:51:06,659 --> 01:51:09,181
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for the question through you, President Morell.

1430
01:51:09,341 --> 01:51:23,849
[SPEAKER_18]: ARPA funding could be used in terms of the flexible funds that are available in terms of what's called the so-called revenue replacement, but it likely wouldn't fall under the categories of an eligible use under the other many categories.

1431
01:51:24,389 --> 01:51:25,230
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, but yeah.

1432
01:51:25,850 --> 01:51:31,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Director Dickinson, can you speak to the choice to use to bond out as opposed to using free cash for this?

1433
01:51:35,051 --> 01:51:35,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, do you need to?

1434
01:51:35,711 --> 01:51:39,412
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

1435
01:51:39,432 --> 01:51:40,613
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, I'm on.

1436
01:51:43,554 --> 01:51:48,055
[SPEAKER_04]: As the chief of staff said, well, two things.

1437
01:51:48,775 --> 01:51:55,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, free cash is not an inexhaustible well that we can keep dipping into.

1438
01:51:56,978 --> 01:52:02,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Also in considering this, quite frankly, we didn't know what free cash was gonna be until this afternoon.

1439
01:52:03,797 --> 01:52:26,680
[SPEAKER_04]: That said, for a lot of projects like this, when you're looking forward at your debt service costs and maintaining a somewhat level amount that you have to pay in debt service, when you're thinking about projects like this that are going to be

1440
01:52:28,477 --> 01:52:32,561
[SPEAKER_04]: aiding the community going forward for 10 years, et cetera.

1441
01:52:32,641 --> 01:52:48,275
[SPEAKER_04]: It does make a certain amount of sense to use borrowed money to fund that because it spreads out the costs over the years that the community is actually getting the use of better sidewalks, the equipment that can fix them, et cetera.

1442
01:52:48,295 --> 01:52:51,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1443
01:52:53,259 --> 01:52:55,081
[SPEAKER_09]: And what interest rate are we borrowing at?

1444
01:52:58,237 --> 01:52:59,257
[SPEAKER_04]: I do not know.

1445
01:53:00,738 --> 01:53:04,201
[SPEAKER_04]: We'd have to take that up with Hilltop and figure out exactly what we'd be getting.

1446
01:53:06,062 --> 01:53:10,345
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't done a GOB issuance for a while.

1447
01:53:11,586 --> 01:53:14,448
[SPEAKER_04]: So that changes on a daily basis.

1448
01:53:18,090 --> 01:53:22,053
[SPEAKER_18]: The only thing I wanted to add, and Director Dickinson just mentioned it, but

1449
01:53:22,822 --> 01:53:28,423
[SPEAKER_18]: The way that borrowing works is when you go out for your long-term borrowing, you secure and you lock your rate at that time.

1450
01:53:28,863 --> 01:53:34,264
[SPEAKER_18]: So there's no way to indicate what we're borrowing today for when the actual borrowing occurs.

1451
01:53:34,684 --> 01:53:40,566
[SPEAKER_18]: And the borrowing typically occurs when the project is complete because you want to borrow the exact number and the exact amount.

1452
01:53:40,986 --> 01:53:42,146
[SPEAKER_18]: So that would be later down the road.

1453
01:53:42,986 --> 01:53:44,026
[SPEAKER_09]: We know the exact number.

1454
01:53:44,726 --> 01:53:46,427
[SPEAKER_18]: Certainly, we do know the exact number.

1455
01:53:46,467 --> 01:53:47,847
[SPEAKER_18]: That was maybe more

1456
01:53:48,610 --> 01:53:51,511
[SPEAKER_18]: an inference to like a building project, for instance.

1457
01:53:51,591 --> 01:54:00,393
[SPEAKER_18]: But the point ultimately is you don't complete what's called the permanent borrowing until once the dollars have been fully spent.

1458
01:54:00,433 --> 01:54:06,554
[SPEAKER_18]: You do a temporary ban, which is a bond anticipation note in advance of the permanent borrowing.

1459
01:54:06,594 --> 01:54:13,716
[SPEAKER_18]: It's, I mean, as with anything, there are niche specific people who are really fine-tuned in these areas.

1460
01:54:13,756 --> 01:54:18,037
[SPEAKER_18]: We have a financial advisor and we have bond counsel for these very specific matters.

1461
01:54:20,090 --> 01:54:20,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1462
01:54:21,551 --> 01:54:22,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Collins.

1463
01:54:22,892 --> 01:54:23,892
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, President Morell.

1464
01:54:23,932 --> 01:54:33,278
[SPEAKER_14]: Director Dixon, just a quick question for you, if you're able to answer it, and if it's off the cuff, that's totally understandable.

1465
01:54:33,339 --> 01:54:47,968
[SPEAKER_14]: But I was just curious, if you knew the amount of our certified free cash when this loan order was being submitted to the council, would it have changed your opinion or your posture on this issue?

1466
01:54:51,757 --> 01:54:52,918
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I can answer that.

1467
01:54:53,098 --> 01:54:56,799
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be a discussion that we would have had at the time.

1468
01:54:56,819 --> 01:55:00,541
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, thank you.

1469
01:55:00,581 --> 01:55:05,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Bears, do you want to start?

1470
01:55:05,463 --> 01:55:10,105
[SPEAKER_13]: I was just going to say, I, for one, would much rather bond this than spend free cash.

1471
01:55:11,086 --> 01:55:13,427
[SPEAKER_13]: Bonding spreads the cost out of our lucidum in a period of time.

1472
01:55:13,447 --> 01:55:15,488
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going towards a capital expense.

1473
01:55:15,548 --> 01:55:19,049
[SPEAKER_13]: We've done bond issues for roads and sidewalks stuff in the past specifically for that reason.

1474
01:55:21,180 --> 01:55:21,900
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll leave it at that.

1475
01:55:22,181 --> 01:55:25,982
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, you know, today we're certified 25 million free cash.

1476
01:55:26,022 --> 01:55:26,263
[SPEAKER_13]: Great.

1477
01:55:27,203 --> 01:55:28,204
[SPEAKER_13]: We're all very happy about that.

1478
01:55:28,704 --> 01:55:33,526
[SPEAKER_13]: There's like nine, seven, eight, 9 million of that going out the door requested to out the door tonight.

1479
01:55:33,726 --> 01:55:36,888
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, so like that, I'm not saying it's all going to go.

1480
01:55:36,908 --> 01:55:38,769
[SPEAKER_13]: Cause I, I don't know.

1481
01:55:39,489 --> 01:55:48,674
[SPEAKER_09]: Going down the line here, we're going to, so we're going to use free cash to buy fire engines, but I'd rather,

1482
01:55:49,986 --> 01:55:51,907
[SPEAKER_09]: bond that out versus free cash.

1483
01:55:52,807 --> 01:55:53,527
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd be happy with that.

1484
01:55:54,147 --> 01:55:59,809
[SPEAKER_09]: Or bond or do a lease loan like we did with the other fire engines versus bonding this money.

1485
01:56:00,209 --> 01:56:04,210
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, we haven't gotten the paper yet, but I don't disagree with that at all.

1486
01:56:04,330 --> 01:56:05,311
[SPEAKER_09]: It's coming right after this.

1487
01:56:05,691 --> 01:56:06,691
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, yeah, no, I know.

1488
01:56:06,711 --> 01:56:15,814
[SPEAKER_09]: If I were picking, which one would I- I'd rather bond the fire engines or do a lease loan like we did with the other fire engines and take this out of free cash.

1489
01:56:16,688 --> 01:56:19,049
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we can do both.

1490
01:56:19,469 --> 01:56:21,831
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a motion on the floor for this paper if we want to keep on.

1491
01:56:22,831 --> 01:56:24,032
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't disagree with you.

1492
01:56:24,412 --> 01:56:25,373
[SPEAKER_13]: I would rather bond both.

1493
01:56:25,713 --> 01:56:26,333
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll leave it at that.

1494
01:56:28,574 --> 01:56:30,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Any further discussion on this paper specifically?

1495
01:56:32,136 --> 01:56:35,878
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have a motion from Councilor Collins to approve for first reading.

1496
01:56:36,959 --> 01:56:38,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Seconded by Councilor Tseng.

1497
01:56:39,400 --> 01:56:40,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1498
01:56:43,682 --> 01:56:43,882
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1499
01:56:48,619 --> 01:56:50,260
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll vote to let it take its first reading.

1500
01:56:52,742 --> 01:56:53,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Collins?

1501
01:56:53,543 --> 01:56:53,743
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1502
01:56:55,484 --> 01:56:55,964
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Knight?

1503
01:56:56,165 --> 01:56:56,345
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1504
01:56:58,506 --> 01:56:59,127
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1505
01:56:59,367 --> 01:56:59,587
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1506
01:57:00,608 --> 01:57:01,148
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Tseng?

1507
01:57:01,168 --> 01:57:01,388
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1508
01:57:02,569 --> 01:57:03,070
[SPEAKER_08]: President Morelle?

1509
01:57:03,670 --> 01:57:03,910
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1510
01:57:03,930 --> 01:57:06,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Five in the affirmative, two in the negative, the motion passes for first reading.

1511
01:57:06,832 --> 01:57:10,055
[SPEAKER_03]: 2-3-0.

1512
01:57:10,155 --> 01:57:13,397
[SPEAKER_17]: Madam President, motion to suspend the rules to take the fire engine paper, please.

1513
01:57:13,837 --> 01:57:16,399
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion of Vice... Second.

1514
01:57:16,459 --> 01:57:16,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

1515
01:57:17,823 --> 01:57:18,764
[SPEAKER_03]: giving you a call back.

1516
01:57:18,784 --> 01:57:18,804
[SPEAKER_03]: 22-071.

1517
01:57:18,824 --> 01:57:20,105
[SPEAKER_03]: 22, all right.

1518
01:57:21,106 --> 01:57:21,767
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me get a thought out.

1519
01:57:21,787 --> 01:57:22,988
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a red paper, it's a big red paper.

1520
01:57:23,008 --> 01:57:24,669
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me complete a thought, just, all right.

1521
01:57:26,111 --> 01:57:30,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion from Councilor Knight to take 23-071 out of order.

1522
01:57:30,795 --> 01:57:32,476
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the last one, right?

1523
01:57:32,496 --> 01:57:34,138
[SPEAKER_03]: 23-071, seconded by Vice President Bears.

1524
01:57:34,178 --> 01:57:34,798
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

1525
01:57:34,818 --> 01:57:36,340
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

1526
01:57:36,640 --> 01:57:37,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, thanks for that.

1527
01:57:39,082 --> 01:57:39,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

1528
01:57:39,903 --> 01:57:39,923
[SPEAKER_03]: 23-071.

1529
01:57:49,039 --> 01:57:56,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Just very quick on this on this very time I'm going to, I'm going to read it for just so people know what we're talking about.

1530
01:57:56,302 --> 01:58:13,350
[SPEAKER_03]: 237071 to our president and members of the city council regarding use of free cash to your present morale and members of the city council I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approves and appropriation of free cash and the amount of $2 million to purchase two pumper trucks for the fire department delivery time for these trucks are 820 calendar days from the completed order.

1531
01:58:13,990 --> 01:58:16,672
[SPEAKER_03]: The following department heads will be available to answer your questions.

1532
01:58:16,732 --> 01:58:22,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Superintendent of Equipment Mike Wenzel, Fire Chief John Friedman, and Finance Director Auditor Bob Dickinson.

1533
01:58:22,357 --> 01:58:25,419
[SPEAKER_03]: Sincerely yours, or respectfully submitted, Mayor Brantlinger.

1534
01:58:26,280 --> 01:58:27,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Madam Chief of Staff, you had something to say?

1535
01:58:27,982 --> 01:58:28,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1536
01:58:28,662 --> 01:58:38,290
[SPEAKER_18]: Just on the last discussion, as it specifically pertains to this item, there's a mass general law that specifies each type of borrowing that can occur.

1537
01:58:38,854 --> 01:58:41,656
[SPEAKER_18]: you can take a look, it's chapter 44, section seven.

1538
01:58:42,196 --> 01:58:51,743
[SPEAKER_18]: It talks about how many years you can bond for each item you want to invest in, and it sets maximum terms for bonding.

1539
01:58:52,863 --> 01:59:01,329
[SPEAKER_18]: Typically for vehicles, it's not explicitly written into the mass general law, but typically for vehicles, that bonding year maximum, we'd have to consult with bond council is five years.

1540
01:59:01,889 --> 01:59:07,473
[SPEAKER_18]: So I just want to provide that information because of the discussion that occurred a moment ago, just as information for the city council.

1541
01:59:08,047 --> 01:59:13,709
[SPEAKER_18]: and also to defer to Director Dickinson as far as the methodology and thinking as far as use of free cash.

1542
01:59:13,789 --> 01:59:27,694
[SPEAKER_18]: And part of that was of course, the time sensitive nature of this matter and the availability out number of 800 and some odd days to purchase these fire trucks and not wanting to delay the purchase.

1543
01:59:27,714 --> 01:59:35,297
[SPEAKER_18]: So there was some atypical factors that contributed to our planning and thinking on this particular matter, just as information.

1544
01:59:35,517 --> 01:59:35,917
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1545
01:59:38,297 --> 01:59:44,601
[SPEAKER_09]: On this particular one, did we examine the lease to own like we did with the previous fire engine?

1546
01:59:45,782 --> 01:59:47,864
[SPEAKER_18]: At this point in time, we could certainly look into that.

1547
01:59:47,964 --> 01:59:55,089
[SPEAKER_18]: That was not a very straightforward process because I went through that firsthand when we actually executed documents.

1548
01:59:55,609 --> 01:59:56,109
[SPEAKER_18]: It was not

1549
01:59:58,967 --> 02:00:05,810
[SPEAKER_18]: It saved a little bit here in terms of funds, and I'm not criticizing the decision or the plan that was- We stole all the money no matter what.

1550
02:00:05,830 --> 02:00:06,170
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah.

1551
02:00:06,190 --> 02:00:07,491
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's spread it out over 10 years.

1552
02:00:07,551 --> 02:00:08,391
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure, sure.

1553
02:00:08,991 --> 02:00:14,293
[SPEAKER_09]: I would think rather than that, I'd rather spread it out over 10 years, but don't use the free cash on that.

1554
02:00:14,313 --> 02:00:15,734
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's an option that can be pursued.

1555
02:00:15,754 --> 02:00:24,277
[SPEAKER_18]: It delays the purchase, the process to get the purchase order submitted to the vendor, which takes 800 and some odd days.

1556
02:00:24,317 --> 02:00:28,199
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what we were- I don't understand why we can't order and then figure out how to pay for it at another date.

1557
02:00:29,358 --> 02:00:29,759
[SPEAKER_09]: process.

1558
02:00:29,799 --> 02:00:33,180
[SPEAKER_18]: That's I defer to Chief Friedman, but it's my understanding that's not possible.

1559
02:00:35,882 --> 02:00:40,284
[SPEAKER_09]: Chief, thank you very much for your work for the last two days and last three days.

1560
02:00:40,304 --> 02:00:43,585
[SPEAKER_15]: A lot of fires is a busy, busy couple of busy couple of days.

1561
02:00:43,966 --> 02:00:44,886
[SPEAKER_15]: Good work.

1562
02:00:44,986 --> 02:00:45,346
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1563
02:00:46,467 --> 02:00:51,029
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, and that's a testament to the men and women under the work underneath, right?

1564
02:00:51,209 --> 02:00:52,510
[SPEAKER_15]: That work really hard at those.

1565
02:00:52,530 --> 02:00:52,870
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1566
02:00:52,890 --> 02:00:54,331
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank everybody for all the work they did.

1567
02:00:55,571 --> 02:00:56,392
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so

1568
02:00:57,455 --> 02:01:04,197
[SPEAKER_15]: I heard the words time sensitive with the council and this project is time sensitive on multiple levels.

1569
02:01:04,578 --> 02:01:08,279
[SPEAKER_15]: So I will just try to be as clear as crystal clear as I can.

1570
02:01:09,299 --> 02:01:13,241
[SPEAKER_15]: And I tried to get the mayor and her staff up to speed on this.

1571
02:01:13,301 --> 02:01:19,143
[SPEAKER_15]: And I believe, you know, that's why we're here before you today because they heard us loud and clear.

1572
02:01:20,843 --> 02:01:22,424
[SPEAKER_15]: So a couple of things are going on here.

1573
02:01:22,584 --> 02:01:24,825
[SPEAKER_15]: The trucks themselves, you heard 820 days.

1574
02:01:26,672 --> 02:01:32,496
[SPEAKER_15]: The actual quote, the price quote, they're only guaranteeing them 30 days.

1575
02:01:33,596 --> 02:01:38,559
[SPEAKER_15]: And we have locked in this 820 days for that 30 days.

1576
02:01:39,380 --> 02:01:44,703
[SPEAKER_15]: And what we're seeing with the other manufacturers is they're going beyond 820 days.

1577
02:01:46,767 --> 02:01:50,311
[SPEAKER_15]: In fact, some of the other ones are up to 1,400 days.

1578
02:01:51,072 --> 02:01:52,334
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's four years.

1579
02:01:53,155 --> 02:02:04,188
[SPEAKER_15]: And what's happening is a lot of the other departments are looking around at other manufacturers, and then they're actually canceling those orders and jumping into the other, so they can get the lower.

1580
02:02:05,458 --> 02:02:05,698
[SPEAKER_15]: number.

1581
02:02:06,498 --> 02:02:12,461
[SPEAKER_15]: So, um, this is time sensitive, like I said, because of the 30 day window.

1582
02:02:12,901 --> 02:02:18,563
[SPEAKER_15]: And then what happens then is not only does that 820 days could go up, the price could go up.

1583
02:02:19,403 --> 02:02:21,484
[SPEAKER_15]: And I've seen it since I took over.

1584
02:02:21,524 --> 02:02:25,305
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been quoting these, you know, as I've been on as chief chief.

1585
02:02:25,605 --> 02:02:27,326
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think anyone is questioning

1586
02:02:28,172 --> 02:02:30,653
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think we're just questioning, how are we gonna pay for it?

1587
02:02:30,673 --> 02:02:32,073
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, understood.

1588
02:02:32,213 --> 02:02:37,874
[SPEAKER_15]: Understood, but what I'm saying is, I don't know if there's time, like if that 30 day clock runs out.

1589
02:02:37,894 --> 02:02:39,135
[SPEAKER_09]: Why can't you put the order in?

1590
02:02:40,615 --> 02:02:41,695
[SPEAKER_09]: Why can't you put the order in?

1591
02:02:41,775 --> 02:02:45,556
[SPEAKER_09]: It's gonna get paid for, whether through free cash or a bond or a lease loan.

1592
02:02:45,576 --> 02:02:48,337
[SPEAKER_09]: It's gonna get paid by some method.

1593
02:02:49,377 --> 02:02:51,858
[SPEAKER_09]: So just put the order in and get the process started.

1594
02:02:52,118 --> 02:02:52,838
[SPEAKER_09]: What are we waiting for?

1595
02:02:53,977 --> 02:02:55,378
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, well, that's kind of what I'm saying.

1596
02:02:55,398 --> 02:02:56,979
[SPEAKER_15]: We're both saying the same thing.

1597
02:02:57,139 --> 02:02:57,359
[SPEAKER_15]: Get it.

1598
02:02:58,820 --> 02:03:00,481
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll figure out how to pay for it.

1599
02:03:00,962 --> 02:03:03,143
[SPEAKER_09]: We got 800 days to figure out how to pay for it.

1600
02:03:03,223 --> 02:03:04,404
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1601
02:03:04,804 --> 02:03:04,984
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

1602
02:03:05,224 --> 02:03:05,705
[SPEAKER_15]: Am I wrong?

1603
02:03:06,185 --> 02:03:09,948
[SPEAKER_15]: So like I said, I know there's a process though.

1604
02:03:10,228 --> 02:03:11,849
[SPEAKER_15]: When we say, okay, yeah, just order it.

1605
02:03:12,381 --> 02:03:15,264
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a process it has to the contract has to be looked at.

1606
02:03:15,805 --> 02:03:23,393
[SPEAKER_15]: And then the mayor has to get that back and then sign off on it and it's the clock has already started once we pulled the price.

1607
02:03:24,094 --> 02:03:24,915
[SPEAKER_15]: You know it's ticking.

1608
02:03:25,135 --> 02:03:33,044
[SPEAKER_15]: So, and then I want to lock this in because I know the parts are going up everything's going up and I've seen it over the course of a year.

1609
02:03:34,105 --> 02:03:35,366
[SPEAKER_15]: It's absolutely crazy.

1610
02:03:35,646 --> 02:03:38,427
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I'm hearing with the other manufacturers, it's going up to four years.

1611
02:03:38,487 --> 02:03:43,570
[SPEAKER_09]: So, so I think in this case, I think in the past, you said you've needed you need three trucks.

1612
02:03:44,510 --> 02:03:44,770
[SPEAKER_09]: Correct.

1613
02:03:44,971 --> 02:03:45,331
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

1614
02:03:45,511 --> 02:03:47,472
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you said you needed we're in the need.

1615
02:03:47,532 --> 02:03:50,633
[SPEAKER_15]: Originally, when I put it in the capital improvements plan, I asked for three.

1616
02:03:50,973 --> 02:03:56,076
[SPEAKER_15]: And if it takes two years, why are we just ordering the three trucks now?

1617
02:03:56,516 --> 02:03:59,878
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I mean, I know when we I sat with the mayor and her staff.

1618
02:04:00,538 --> 02:04:06,620
[SPEAKER_15]: We, we settled on to the third one is still in the capital improvements plan that's a living document that we look at all the time.

1619
02:04:07,241 --> 02:04:22,246
[SPEAKER_15]: This is real relief that's going to come in the form of two new trucks will rotate the fleet at that time when they arrive and, and maybe during the during that time frame, you know that she finds the money for the third one somehow we figure that part out.

1620
02:04:23,239 --> 02:04:28,481
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, that's above my pay grade so I put it in the capital improvements plan, and I communicated.

1621
02:04:28,501 --> 02:04:36,365
[SPEAKER_15]: And the reason we pulled this out and the reason why before you tonight is because of this sensitive nature of this and how quick it has to be decided on.

1622
02:04:37,005 --> 02:04:39,266
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, we just can't afford to wait.

1623
02:04:40,146 --> 02:04:40,447
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1624
02:04:44,488 --> 02:04:45,029
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1625
02:04:45,309 --> 02:04:45,669
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1626
02:04:49,236 --> 02:04:54,601
[SPEAKER_07]: When I order equipment, I have to secure funding prior to them accepting the order.

1627
02:04:55,221 --> 02:04:57,002
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that's in this case as well.

1628
02:04:57,823 --> 02:04:59,885
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that's what the urgency is.

1629
02:04:59,985 --> 02:05:04,208
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, again, you'll secure funding because you're doing it through free cash, but

1630
02:05:05,884 --> 02:05:08,166
[SPEAKER_07]: through the process, through the process.

1631
02:05:08,446 --> 02:05:08,647
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

1632
02:05:08,667 --> 02:05:13,471
[SPEAKER_07]: I think what the chief is saying is if we go the lease route.

1633
02:05:14,051 --> 02:05:14,952
[SPEAKER_09]: We have the free cash.

1634
02:05:15,573 --> 02:05:21,898
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to take this money out of free cash, but along the process, we could maybe change the process.

1635
02:05:21,958 --> 02:05:22,659
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to get paid.

1636
02:05:22,819 --> 02:05:23,720
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that not an option?

1637
02:05:24,876 --> 02:05:27,677
[SPEAKER_15]: I, you know, I'm not a lawyer.

1638
02:05:27,737 --> 02:05:29,217
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not a finance person here either.

1639
02:05:29,677 --> 02:05:32,598
[SPEAKER_09]: But you know, and I think you should know this tonight.

1640
02:05:33,458 --> 02:05:34,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Director Dickinson, can you speak to that?

1641
02:05:35,078 --> 02:05:35,959
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that something that could happen?

1642
02:05:36,019 --> 02:05:38,739
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like if we vote for free cash, can we then bond out for something?

1643
02:05:38,759 --> 02:05:41,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we change the process or lease to owner the options?

1644
02:05:42,180 --> 02:05:44,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Caraviello is mentioning.

1645
02:05:48,422 --> 02:05:50,522
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe that down the road we can change that.

1646
02:05:51,122 --> 02:05:53,083
[SPEAKER_04]: From my point of view as the finance guy,

1647
02:05:54,168 --> 02:05:59,611
[SPEAKER_04]: When we're putting in a PO, when we're ordering something, I like to have a funding source.

1648
02:06:00,091 --> 02:06:02,292
[SPEAKER_04]: In this case, the funding source would be free cash.

1649
02:06:02,732 --> 02:06:15,138
[SPEAKER_04]: If down the road, we decided it should be bonding, if we're gonna get into a lease agreement, I would... The problem with those is then you need to fund it every single year.

1650
02:06:15,778 --> 02:06:23,142
[SPEAKER_04]: But in order to get this properly in the system, from my point of view, the simplest solution right now

1651
02:06:23,938 --> 02:06:27,800
[SPEAKER_04]: is to use free cash, generate the POs, and get this started.

1652
02:06:27,980 --> 02:06:31,762
[SPEAKER_04]: That way the vendor knows that we have the money in place to buy it.

1653
02:06:33,402 --> 02:06:41,006
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're saying that somewhere along the process, it can be changed, the method of payment, correct?

1654
02:06:41,026 --> 02:06:45,328
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have to check with legal about that, but I believe that, yes.

1655
02:06:45,968 --> 02:06:47,209
[SPEAKER_04]: That's 600 as soon as we pick up the phone.

1656
02:06:53,502 --> 02:06:55,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Director Dickinson, Councilor Scarpelli.

1657
02:06:55,823 --> 02:06:57,705
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I follow up with Barbara real quick?

1658
02:06:57,725 --> 02:06:59,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, go ahead.

1659
02:06:59,025 --> 02:07:00,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, calm down.

1660
02:07:00,466 --> 02:07:03,728
[SPEAKER_06]: Madam President, I yield to Councilor Bears for one minute.

1661
02:07:03,808 --> 02:07:04,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1662
02:07:04,789 --> 02:07:06,530
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot of crosstalk.

1663
02:07:06,610 --> 02:07:07,810
[SPEAKER_13]: The timeline is not good.

1664
02:07:08,251 --> 02:07:09,571
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm right there with you, Madam President.

1665
02:07:11,012 --> 02:07:13,973
[SPEAKER_13]: Bob, just my other question is just when does it leave free cash?

1666
02:07:13,993 --> 02:07:27,536
[SPEAKER_13]: So if we approve it as free cash right now, does that mean that it's sitting there for 400, 500, 600, 800 days until we're actually paying these people and that's what gives us some time to potentially adjust the source or the method in which we're paying for it?

1667
02:07:30,076 --> 02:07:38,578
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, at the end of the year, it would have to be reserved or transferred to a capital project fund so that it was actually reserved funding.

1668
02:07:39,680 --> 02:07:53,090
[SPEAKER_04]: So when we calculate free cash as of June 30th of 2023, necessarily that would come out of what would be considered for free cash.

1669
02:07:54,471 --> 02:07:55,932
[SPEAKER_13]: And just one really quick follow-up.

1670
02:07:55,952 --> 02:07:59,395
[SPEAKER_13]: So the 25 million figure that we got certified today, that is as of June 30th, 2022.

1671
02:07:59,475 --> 02:07:59,855
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that correct?

1672
02:07:59,875 --> 02:07:59,935
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1673
02:08:02,955 --> 02:08:13,079
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's even whatever we've accrued this year that's in free cash, but we don't have the certification and won't have it until a year from now when there's a significant lag time.

1674
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:14,580
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

1675
02:08:14,600 --> 02:08:17,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President.

1676
02:08:17,961 --> 02:08:21,263
[SPEAKER_06]: Chief, first of all, again, thank you.

1677
02:08:21,403 --> 02:08:23,604
[SPEAKER_06]: And more importantly, if I fight is that

1678
02:08:25,168 --> 02:08:34,173
[SPEAKER_06]: two giant fires in one week, and then not including, I'm sure, we assisted with the Somerville fire right down the street.

1679
02:08:34,293 --> 02:08:39,035
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're talking three fires in a matter of a week that were pretty serious.

1680
02:08:39,075 --> 02:08:44,558
[SPEAKER_06]: So these are the situations where it's time sensitive that I need to support.

1681
02:08:45,159 --> 02:08:53,123
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm glad my question was really more of the fact that seeing what we went through this week and really needing the trucks that we need to

1682
02:08:53,968 --> 02:09:00,753
[SPEAKER_06]: to function, making sure everybody's safe, is that I was, my question was also the third truck.

1683
02:09:00,773 --> 02:09:03,534
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm glad to see that'll be part of that capital plan.

1684
02:09:04,395 --> 02:09:11,900
[SPEAKER_06]: And it'll be something that I'll be pushing for because ultimately, this is about safety of our firefighters and safety of our citizens.

1685
02:09:11,940 --> 02:09:16,863
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and making sure we have the equipment needed to do the job.

1686
02:09:16,923 --> 02:09:18,364
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, I can't

1687
02:09:19,767 --> 02:09:26,494
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you enough, I think that we rest easy knowing that we have a department that, although we lost some property, no one died.

1688
02:09:27,355 --> 02:09:32,580
[SPEAKER_06]: And everybody went home safe so yeah, I thought that that's very important so I just wanted to thank you.

1689
02:09:32,620 --> 02:09:37,806
[SPEAKER_15]: So these, these are what we're asking for the tools for them to continue to see that good work.

1690
02:09:39,463 --> 02:09:41,465
[SPEAKER_15]: It's absolutely in the capital improvement plan.

1691
02:09:42,105 --> 02:09:48,070
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's my job to sort of expedite it like this when I see how long it's gonna take to get them.

1692
02:09:48,110 --> 02:09:50,132
[SPEAKER_15]: It keeps increasing, the price keeps going up.

1693
02:09:50,592 --> 02:09:53,034
[SPEAKER_06]: I see the issues you're facing.

1694
02:09:53,074 --> 02:09:57,618
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm trying to bring the council awareness up to where we have the mayor now.

1695
02:09:57,678 --> 02:09:58,179
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, thank you.

1696
02:09:58,599 --> 02:09:59,139
[SPEAKER_15]: I appreciate it.

1697
02:09:59,180 --> 02:09:59,480
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1698
02:09:59,980 --> 02:10:01,001
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what we needed.

1699
02:10:01,041 --> 02:10:02,122
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you, Madam President.

1700
02:10:02,142 --> 02:10:02,482
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1701
02:10:03,303 --> 02:10:04,404
[SPEAKER_03]: Any further discussion from the council?

1702
02:10:04,444 --> 02:10:05,064
[SPEAKER_03]: I move approval.

1703
02:10:05,865 --> 02:10:12,649
[SPEAKER_03]: So on the motion of Cascara Pelli to approve second by racism bears Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1704
02:10:18,572 --> 02:10:18,712
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1705
02:10:18,752 --> 02:10:18,992
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1706
02:10:19,032 --> 02:10:19,273
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1707
02:10:19,313 --> 02:10:19,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1708
02:10:20,453 --> 02:10:20,673
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1709
02:10:20,713 --> 02:10:21,154
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1710
02:10:21,274 --> 02:10:21,574
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1711
02:10:22,174 --> 02:10:22,374
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1712
02:10:22,434 --> 02:10:22,755
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1713
02:10:22,855 --> 02:10:23,055
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1714
02:10:35,060 --> 02:10:37,742
[SPEAKER_03]: We're under suspension for that one paper, where are we going?

1715
02:10:38,322 --> 02:10:39,203
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to revert.

1716
02:10:40,264 --> 02:10:44,847
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion by Senator Bears to revert back to regular business, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

1717
02:10:44,887 --> 02:10:45,588
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

1718
02:10:45,608 --> 02:10:45,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

1719
02:10:45,908 --> 02:10:46,909
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

1720
02:10:46,949 --> 02:10:47,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

1721
02:10:47,810 --> 02:10:48,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Going to 23-059.

1722
02:10:49,231 --> 02:10:57,717
[SPEAKER_03]: To Honorable President Morell and members of Medford City Council, regarding proposed wage adjustment for non-union personnel.

1723
02:10:57,757 --> 02:11:03,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Dear President Morell and members of the City Council, I respect the request and recommend the City Council approve the following amendments

1724
02:11:03,500 --> 02:11:18,411
[SPEAKER_03]: to revise ordinances chapter 66 entitled personnel article two entitled reserve the city's classifications and compensation plan formally included as article two sections 66-31 through 66-40 by adopting the following change.

1725
02:11:19,151 --> 02:11:24,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Non-union personnel effective January 1st, 2021 increase the base salary of all non-union titles by 2%.

1726
02:11:25,456 --> 02:11:29,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Effective January 1st, 2022 increase the base salary of all non-union titles by 2%.

1727
02:11:30,197 --> 02:11:34,100
[SPEAKER_03]: back to January 1 2023 increase the base salary of all non union titles by 2%.

1728
02:11:34,861 --> 02:11:36,362
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.

1729
02:11:36,883 --> 02:11:37,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Respectfully submitted.

1730
02:11:46,177 --> 02:11:48,199
[SPEAKER_08]: I always look.

1731
02:11:48,239 --> 02:11:48,579
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1732
02:11:49,880 --> 02:11:50,321
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1733
02:11:50,341 --> 02:11:51,181
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks, guys.

1734
02:11:51,201 --> 02:11:52,162
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate your deference.

1735
02:11:52,983 --> 02:11:54,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, we're right.

1736
02:11:54,925 --> 02:12:00,029
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I probably have what might be an unpopular opinion on this paper, so I just wanted to get it out of the way.

1737
02:12:00,229 --> 02:12:09,697
[SPEAKER_14]: First, um, you know, another another Councilor said earlier in this meeting, you know, we've spent a long time since we had a full compliment of department heads in City Hall.

1738
02:12:09,737 --> 02:12:11,699
[SPEAKER_14]: It's affecting our ability to move forward as community.

1739
02:12:12,720 --> 02:12:13,340
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that that's

1740
02:12:14,081 --> 02:12:26,329
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, one of the reasons why it's important to make sure that we are doing what is within our power to retain the skilled public service workers that we do have within City Hall.

1741
02:12:26,369 --> 02:12:37,817
[SPEAKER_14]: I know for very good reason, we've had a lot of discussions this year about the plight of our unionized city workers for good reason.

1742
02:12:38,498 --> 02:12:40,419
[SPEAKER_14]: And we've been asked to advocate for those workers.

1743
02:12:40,479 --> 02:12:41,560
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think whenever possible,

1744
02:12:42,420 --> 02:12:47,722
[SPEAKER_14]: this council has tried to, and I think that's something that we can be proud of and that we have to continue to do.

1745
02:12:48,683 --> 02:12:54,245
[SPEAKER_14]: But I don't think that the narrative here is the non-union titles versus the unionized titles.

1746
02:12:54,285 --> 02:12:55,345
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's a false binary.

1747
02:12:55,745 --> 02:13:04,468
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that we need to stick up for the city workers that are unionized as well as sticking up for the city workers that aren't, because everybody is experiencing cost of living increases.

1748
02:13:04,528 --> 02:13:08,910
[SPEAKER_14]: And the issue here is fair bargaining for those workers who are unionized at the same time.

1749
02:13:09,402 --> 02:13:12,684
[SPEAKER_14]: We need to keep people in the building, to keep the lights on, to keep the wheels turning.

1750
02:13:12,704 --> 02:13:14,165
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's all I'll be supporting this paper tonight.

1751
02:13:14,665 --> 02:13:17,206
[SPEAKER_14]: And I look forward to hearing my fellow councilors perspective on the matter.

1752
02:13:18,147 --> 02:13:18,767
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor.

1753
02:13:18,807 --> 02:13:19,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Pele.

1754
02:13:19,547 --> 02:13:20,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President.

1755
02:13:20,528 --> 02:13:21,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Collins-Lee.

1756
02:13:22,169 --> 02:13:38,678
[SPEAKER_06]: I will tell you, I did receive phone calls from union members that stress the fact that unless the equity and fair negotiations with non-union, with union members and not having their contracts settled

1757
02:13:39,738 --> 02:13:46,703
[SPEAKER_06]: with for years, I think it would go totally against what we have been preaching about supporting our union members.

1758
02:13:47,284 --> 02:13:56,371
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that's one of the reasons why I won't and again, not a penny I will vote for until we have a true understanding of what we're doing financially in this community.

1759
02:13:56,411 --> 02:13:57,692
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you, Madam President.

1760
02:13:57,952 --> 02:13:58,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1761
02:14:00,313 --> 02:14:01,775
[SPEAKER_03]: Any further advice from bears?

1762
02:14:01,795 --> 02:14:08,299
[SPEAKER_13]: I would just say, you know, these are folks I'm going to race this January 1 2020.

1763
02:14:09,800 --> 02:14:13,722
[SPEAKER_13]: the appropriation is $80,000 for the rest of this fiscal year.

1764
02:14:14,363 --> 02:14:24,188
[SPEAKER_13]: I understand and respect Councilor Scarapelli's position, but also, you know, we have an opportunity to do this for some employees.

1765
02:14:24,288 --> 02:14:30,972
[SPEAKER_13]: I wish we had in front of us contracts to do this for all employees, and I don't want to step away from that position in any sort of way.

1766
02:14:32,152 --> 02:14:32,553
[SPEAKER_13]: But again,

1767
02:14:33,620 --> 02:14:36,081
[SPEAKER_13]: similarly to prior discussions.

1768
02:14:36,742 --> 02:14:39,824
[SPEAKER_13]: We have people who are already working here who've gone without for a very long time.

1769
02:14:40,284 --> 02:14:41,705
[SPEAKER_13]: I hear that across all fronts.

1770
02:14:44,006 --> 02:14:50,810
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't want us to lose people from city government because they can go somewhere else and get a raise.

1771
02:14:52,010 --> 02:14:53,971
[SPEAKER_13]: We've faced that in a bunch of different places.

1772
02:14:54,052 --> 02:14:57,954
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, my preference would be to be able to say that for everyone.

1773
02:14:57,994 --> 02:15:00,395
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd like there to be five papers on here with five contracts.

1774
02:15:00,675 --> 02:15:01,216
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what I want.

1775
02:15:02,667 --> 02:15:05,069
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been made clear many times and made clear again tonight.

1776
02:15:06,070 --> 02:15:08,351
[SPEAKER_13]: The administration says personnel issues, we're not going to discuss it here.

1777
02:15:08,411 --> 02:15:17,138
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, I'm not involved in those negotiations, but I can tell you what my position is, is that I think that there should be a fair agreement reached as quickly as possible.

1778
02:15:17,178 --> 02:15:23,323
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think the fact that contracts have been out so long and non-union employees have gone without a raise so long are both really major problems.

1779
02:15:23,543 --> 02:15:25,024
[SPEAKER_13]: We can correct one of those problems tonight.

1780
02:15:25,264 --> 02:15:25,524
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1781
02:15:28,148 --> 02:15:29,269
[SPEAKER_17]: Madam President, thank you very much.

1782
02:15:29,909 --> 02:15:33,512
[SPEAKER_17]: Can anybody tell me what titles are covered under this before us this evening?

1783
02:15:36,434 --> 02:15:38,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Madam Chief of Staff, she's joined by Zoom now.

1784
02:15:38,635 --> 02:15:41,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have a list of the titles that are covered by this?

1785
02:15:44,479 --> 02:15:45,479
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, I gotta unmute you.

1786
02:15:46,040 --> 02:15:47,601
[SPEAKER_17]: It's kind of important for us to look at that.

1787
02:15:47,661 --> 02:15:48,902
[SPEAKER_17]: Go ahead.

1788
02:15:51,601 --> 02:15:54,843
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, I'm just gonna speak without video at this point.

1789
02:15:55,283 --> 02:15:59,625
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, I can read that off if the council would like, it's a lengthy list.

1790
02:15:59,785 --> 02:16:03,207
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know how you'd like to- I'll be honest with you, Madam President.

1791
02:16:04,187 --> 02:16:05,988
[SPEAKER_17]: You're asking us to spend 80,000 bucks on.

1792
02:16:08,910 --> 02:16:10,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'd be happy to have both.

1793
02:16:10,330 --> 02:16:12,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, can we have it read now and also get a copy?

1794
02:16:12,551 --> 02:16:15,453
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, I'm searching for it.

1795
02:16:15,473 --> 02:16:18,474
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not sure if Director Dickinson has it up, but if he does, I defer to him.

1796
02:16:18,494 --> 02:16:19,595
[SPEAKER_18]: Let me just find it right now.

1797
02:16:28,027 --> 02:16:28,167
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

1798
02:16:36,495 --> 02:16:36,995
[SPEAKER_02]: I have it.

1799
02:16:38,436 --> 02:16:39,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Just opening the document now.

1800
02:16:48,746 --> 02:16:49,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1801
02:16:49,246 --> 02:16:49,726
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1802
02:16:50,267 --> 02:16:53,290
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me just...

1803
02:16:54,017 --> 02:17:02,142
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, so in no particular order, this spreadsheet, I don't believe, I don't know if there is a particular, I don't know if the spreadsheet that I have, it's a working document.

1804
02:17:03,443 --> 02:17:05,624
[SPEAKER_18]: So I can certainly make it alphabetical.

1805
02:17:05,684 --> 02:17:06,665
[SPEAKER_18]: Why don't I try to do that here?

1806
02:17:07,405 --> 02:17:09,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you able to share on a screen, Madam Chief of Staff?

1807
02:17:10,767 --> 02:17:12,148
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yes, I could.

1808
02:17:12,168 --> 02:17:14,870
[SPEAKER_03]: I think she's gonna make you a co-host so you can do that.

1809
02:17:16,231 --> 02:17:16,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

1810
02:17:29,229 --> 02:17:29,430
Thank you.

1811
02:17:57,015 --> 02:17:59,156
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so can you see this?

1812
02:17:59,216 --> 02:17:59,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this large enough?

1813
02:17:59,996 --> 02:18:02,677
[SPEAKER_02]: I can zoom in further.

1814
02:18:06,178 --> 02:18:07,999
[SPEAKER_18]: Shall I zoom in further, or is this sufficient?

1815
02:18:08,499 --> 02:18:10,300
[SPEAKER_03]: These are names and not job titles.

1816
02:18:10,640 --> 02:18:11,600
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have job titles?

1817
02:18:13,741 --> 02:18:14,781
[SPEAKER_02]: I will hold on.

1818
02:18:14,901 --> 02:18:16,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me see if I have job titles.

1819
02:18:17,883 --> 02:18:18,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, she stopped.

1820
02:18:28,723 --> 02:18:28,963
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

1821
02:18:35,345 --> 02:18:40,507
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a motion from sorry, Councilor Tseng I have a motion from Councilor Knight to table to have a second.

1822
02:18:45,028 --> 02:18:47,889
[SPEAKER_13]: We can come back to this meeting just we'll give you time to pull that information.

1823
02:18:48,709 --> 02:18:50,030
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm ready to share screen again.

1824
02:18:52,105 --> 02:18:53,346
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, Madam Chief of Staff.

1825
02:18:53,406 --> 02:18:57,569
[SPEAKER_18]: It was just indicating I'm ready to share and I have the information available.

1826
02:18:58,169 --> 02:18:58,810
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, great.

1827
02:19:01,812 --> 02:19:02,052
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1828
02:19:06,055 --> 02:19:09,037
[SPEAKER_18]: there's been a number of calculations that have been conducted.

1829
02:19:09,197 --> 02:19:16,923
[SPEAKER_18]: And so there are ones that are on this list, like for instance, mayor, the mayor has put it in the hands of the city council.

1830
02:19:16,963 --> 02:19:24,248
[SPEAKER_18]: If the mayor, if the city council does not want the mayor to receive a COLA, the city council can certainly vote to exclude it.

1831
02:19:26,029 --> 02:19:27,170
[SPEAKER_18]: Same with the city council.

1832
02:19:27,230 --> 02:19:32,694
[SPEAKER_18]: If the city council is to get an increase, because it's non-union, it can certainly either include it or exclude it.

1833
02:19:33,795 --> 02:19:34,716
[SPEAKER_18]: So this is the list here.

1834
02:19:35,792 --> 02:19:39,553
[SPEAKER_18]: There are some, it appears that there is a couple titles missing, but that's not by intent.

1835
02:19:40,013 --> 02:19:41,654
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd have to look into that further.

1836
02:19:46,775 --> 02:19:55,137
[SPEAKER_17]: I appreciate the financial transparency and the fiscal constraint that the administration has shown us by offering this paper with such a paperwork that supports it.

1837
02:19:55,177 --> 02:19:55,938
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much.

1838
02:19:57,458 --> 02:19:58,538
[SPEAKER_02]: You're welcome, Councilor Knight.

1839
02:20:00,799 --> 02:20:01,439
[SPEAKER_06]: Madam President.

1840
02:20:02,840 --> 02:20:03,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, these are the positions.

1841
02:20:06,254 --> 02:20:16,122
[SPEAKER_06]: Madam President, if we could, I'd rather table this to get further understanding because I thought that it was just 2% voting on our raise for us, I believe.

1842
02:20:16,382 --> 02:20:19,725
[SPEAKER_03]: She said we are included in this group and if we want to separate us out.

1843
02:20:20,045 --> 02:20:22,387
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, we can separate, but I have a legal question on that.

1844
02:20:22,708 --> 02:20:23,889
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think we can vote for our own raise.

1845
02:20:23,909 --> 02:20:27,391
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we need to vote for a raise to go if it's for this body that we serve on.

1846
02:20:27,411 --> 02:20:28,732
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think we can vote for it in this term.

1847
02:20:28,753 --> 02:20:31,074
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it has to be a term that we're not in or it's an ethics violation.

1848
02:20:36,565 --> 02:20:38,247
[SPEAKER_13]: In my opinion, so I'd refer it to legal counsel.

1849
02:20:38,607 --> 02:20:39,068
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

1850
02:20:39,368 --> 02:20:43,172
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, fine, but I'll move to approve but exclude the mayor and the city council.

1851
02:20:43,192 --> 02:20:47,597
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, as our only motion has a second.

1852
02:20:48,818 --> 02:20:54,604
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have a motion to approve and exclude the mayor and the city council from this second by Councilor Collins any further discussion.

1853
02:20:57,106 --> 02:20:58,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Seeing none, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1854
02:21:12,616 --> 02:21:16,980
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, that's what this is photo proof of first reading and we didn't have a print out of the names on the list.

1855
02:21:17,060 --> 02:21:18,642
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm saying this is crazy.

1856
02:21:19,703 --> 02:21:26,930
[SPEAKER_17]: I feel like we've been kind of, they kind of tried to pull the rug underneath our feet here and stick a paper in front of our face to give the mayor a raise and never said it was for the mayor.

1857
02:21:27,431 --> 02:21:32,096
[SPEAKER_17]: And now all of a sudden, we're finding out that the 11th hour, Madam Chief of Staff, do you have your hand raised.

1858
02:21:32,955 --> 02:21:34,336
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Morell.

1859
02:21:34,496 --> 02:21:38,939
[SPEAKER_18]: In an email from the mayor today, she disclosed that specifically.

1860
02:21:39,519 --> 02:21:45,203
[SPEAKER_18]: So I apologize if the members of the council haven't seen that email, but I just wanna specify that she did disclose that.

1861
02:21:46,343 --> 02:21:50,566
[SPEAKER_18]: And we don't typically provide a list of names for any contracts that are ratified.

1862
02:21:50,626 --> 02:21:53,628
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't see how this is any different from a collective bargaining agreement.

1863
02:21:54,308 --> 02:21:56,049
[SPEAKER_18]: So again, that was disclosed.

1864
02:21:58,030 --> 02:21:58,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1865
02:21:58,331 --> 02:22:02,053
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so I have a motion on the floor to approve for first reading.

1866
02:22:03,193 --> 02:22:06,915
[SPEAKER_03]: from President Bears, seconded by Councilor Collins, Mr. Clerk.

1867
02:22:06,995 --> 02:22:08,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Excluding the Mayor and the City Council.

1868
02:22:10,478 --> 02:22:12,179
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1869
02:22:12,219 --> 02:22:12,479
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1870
02:22:13,180 --> 02:22:13,520
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1871
02:22:14,501 --> 02:22:15,362
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1872
02:22:15,422 --> 02:22:15,562
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1873
02:22:15,602 --> 02:22:15,662
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1874
02:22:32,424 --> 02:22:32,664
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

1875
02:22:32,684 --> 02:22:35,426
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1876
02:22:36,726 --> 02:22:39,788
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1877
02:22:40,328 --> 02:22:40,548
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1878
02:22:40,628 --> 02:22:42,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Five in the in front of two in the negative.

1879
02:22:42,029 --> 02:22:43,450
[SPEAKER_03]: The motion passes for first reading.

1880
02:22:49,228 --> 02:22:56,414
[SPEAKER_03]: 23-060, to Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council regarding use of free cash.

1881
02:22:56,434 --> 02:23:04,700
[SPEAKER_03]: To your President and members of the City Council, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approves the appropriation of one free cash in the amount of $680,342.38 to purchase the following items.

1882
02:23:04,720 --> 02:23:06,861
[SPEAKER_03]: $370,453.90 to pay for 55% of the cost of an electric street sweeper.

1883

[SPEAKER_06]: Right off the bat, gentlemen, the sweeper.

1894
02:24:22,888 --> 02:24:24,588
[SPEAKER_06]: Does this mean we'll have two street sweepers?

1895
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:31,140
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it functional or no?

1896
02:24:32,021 --> 02:24:33,041
[SPEAKER_07]: The street sweeper?

1897
02:24:33,061 --> 02:24:33,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that we have.

1898
02:24:33,801 --> 02:24:38,763
[SPEAKER_07]: It is far past, it is functional, but it's far past its lifespan.

1899
02:24:38,783 --> 02:24:40,424
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I understand.

1900
02:24:40,804 --> 02:24:46,085
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is what, again, I'm gonna just, this is my, I'm gonna make this cry every single time.

1901
02:24:46,766 --> 02:24:59,250
[SPEAKER_06]: Until we know where we are financially and purchasing these items, it's just, it's irresponsible for us, it is.

1902
02:25:00,078 --> 02:25:00,518
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

1903
02:25:00,558 --> 02:25:05,342
[SPEAKER_06]: I know there are things like the fire trucks at a time sensitive, but this is just irresponsible.

1904
02:25:05,643 --> 02:25:07,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep voting these papers through.

1905
02:25:07,064 --> 02:25:09,646
[SPEAKER_06]: What we just did a minute ago is beyond me.

1906
02:25:09,666 --> 02:25:12,148
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, this is money.

1907
02:25:12,948 --> 02:25:13,949
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't know where we are.

1908
02:25:15,871 --> 02:25:16,812
[SPEAKER_06]: We keep voting for it.

1909
02:25:18,033 --> 02:25:19,414
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, I will not vote for this.

1910
02:25:20,214 --> 02:25:22,916
[SPEAKER_06]: And I implore my colleagues to think about it.

1911
02:25:22,937 --> 02:25:24,598
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate it.

1912
02:25:24,618 --> 02:25:25,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1913
02:25:30,473 --> 02:25:34,920
[SPEAKER_13]: Just sorry if you already have said this, my understanding is there's a grant for the other 45% of the sweeper?

1914
02:25:35,141 --> 02:25:35,461
[SPEAKER_08]: Correct.

1915
02:25:35,882 --> 02:25:37,605
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a time contingency on the grant?

1916
02:25:38,907 --> 02:25:43,895
[SPEAKER_13]: Like how if we, you know, do we lose the grant if we don't approve the other half by a certain period of time or?

1917
02:25:44,994 --> 02:25:46,195
[SPEAKER_16]: I do believe that is the case.

1918
02:25:47,056 --> 02:25:51,820
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I mean, I would also say just for all these these are also time sensitive.

1919
02:25:52,380 --> 02:25:54,462
[SPEAKER_16]: And therefore, just our general operations.

1920
02:25:54,883 --> 02:25:58,225
[SPEAKER_16]: But these are routine vehicles that just need to be purchased.

1921
02:25:58,726 --> 02:26:00,687
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Wentzell can give the council an idea.

1922
02:26:01,508 --> 02:26:20,785
[SPEAKER_16]: the state of some of the trucks in our fleet and you know these are really the next round of vehicles on our capital improvement plan to purchase and then you know we'll have routine purchases hopefully every single year that look similar to this because that's what needs to happen in a

1923
02:26:21,345 --> 02:26:23,467
[SPEAKER_16]: the properly functioning DPW fleet.

1924
02:26:24,208 --> 02:26:36,481
[SPEAKER_16]: So, these are vehicles that are the purchase of these is time sensitive we've been trying to, you know, work with the administration to get the funding for these vehicles for quite some time.

1925
02:26:37,021 --> 02:26:38,203
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, no, well heard.

1926
02:26:38,383 --> 02:26:43,568
[SPEAKER_13]: And since you, you know, this is something we had a great conversation with director Dickinson.

1927
02:26:44,490 --> 02:26:48,311
[SPEAKER_13]: three and a half hours ago, talking about the budget process.

1928
02:26:48,811 --> 02:26:59,895
[SPEAKER_13]: And when you mentioned this is gonna be a regular thing, I think, you know, again, I'm not speaking, I hear you on the need here, I hear this grant, the grant funds could be contingent on the approval of the other half, like, I don't have a problem with anything here.

1929
02:26:59,915 --> 02:27:03,957
[SPEAKER_13]: I share Councilor Scarborough's general concerns about the overall issue.

1930
02:27:05,177 --> 02:27:10,679
[SPEAKER_13]: But if we could figure out a way to build that into the regular budget process,

1931
02:27:11,588 --> 02:27:14,270
[SPEAKER_13]: This is all I'm saying is it's just a, it's an issue of perception.

1932
02:27:15,051 --> 02:27:16,052
[SPEAKER_13]: We say use some free cash.

1933
02:27:16,072 --> 02:27:17,453
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to use free cash for these things.

1934
02:27:17,493 --> 02:27:22,838
[SPEAKER_13]: We know they're going to be regular things that we need to do every year, but we go to free cash and some years, you know, right.

1935
02:27:22,858 --> 02:27:26,261
[SPEAKER_13]: The last four years, like free cash, hasn't been an option in a lot of cases.

1936
02:27:26,321 --> 02:27:30,085
[SPEAKER_13]: So we delay and we defer on the central capital purchases.

1937
02:27:30,565 --> 02:27:35,270
[SPEAKER_13]: And then you end up with an even worse fleet and you guys spending even more time trying to fix old stuff.

1938
02:27:35,910 --> 02:27:50,495
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just saying in general, like, you know, if you're having the discussions that we're having around the budget, if we can build in things that we think are going to be annual recurring costs into the budget process, rather than having to wait on free cash certification to then come before us and use free cash for discrete things like this.

1939
02:27:50,936 --> 02:27:52,996
[SPEAKER_13]: I just think it goes a long way for us in the long run.

1940
02:27:53,577 --> 02:27:53,737
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1941
02:28:00,567 --> 02:28:07,733
[SPEAKER_16]: plan to come to you yearly to get the money appropriated for operating capital like this.

1942
02:28:08,154 --> 02:28:26,230
[SPEAKER_16]: So, but with that said, it is, since I've been leading the DPW, we do have a, and Mr. Wentz leading the fleet, we do have a pretty rigid sort of schedule of vehicle purchases that we need to make year over year.

1943
02:28:26,610 --> 02:28:32,493
[SPEAKER_16]: And you'll see that you saw that in the previous capital plan, and you'll see that in the next update as well.

1944
02:28:32,633 --> 02:28:35,474
[SPEAKER_16]: So some of these vehicles were in that original capital plan.

1945
02:28:35,734 --> 02:28:43,538
[SPEAKER_16]: So out of all the things that we've talked about tonight, and what's in capital plans and not, these actually are in the capital plan.

1946
02:28:43,598 --> 02:28:45,819
[SPEAKER_16]: And it is very time sensitive.

1947
02:28:45,879 --> 02:28:50,742
[SPEAKER_16]: So I would say, not like some of the other things tonight, but these are very time sensitive.

1948
02:28:50,802 --> 02:28:51,422
[SPEAKER_13]: No, well heard.

1949
02:28:51,782 --> 02:28:54,043
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, I'm just, it's a general comment.

1950
02:28:54,563 --> 02:28:55,164
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.

1951
02:28:56,457 --> 02:28:59,120
[SPEAKER_13]: If we had the capital plan updated every year attached to the city budget.

1952
02:28:59,981 --> 02:29:01,222
[SPEAKER_13]: It just changes the conversation.

1953
02:29:01,522 --> 02:29:01,682
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.

1954
02:29:01,863 --> 02:29:02,143
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks.

1955
02:29:03,785 --> 02:29:05,626
[SPEAKER_09]: That's great.

1956
02:29:05,646 --> 02:29:06,667
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1957
02:29:07,969 --> 02:29:11,893
[SPEAKER_09]: Why aren't these things eligible for funding other cities and towns have gotten

1958
02:29:12,819 --> 02:29:14,240
[SPEAKER_09]: trucks and things with their ARPA funds.

1959
02:29:14,720 --> 02:29:17,462
[SPEAKER_09]: Why aren't we using our ARPA funds for this?

1960
02:29:17,982 --> 02:29:20,044
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not necessarily a question for me.

1961
02:29:20,384 --> 02:29:21,445
[SPEAKER_16]: We need the vehicles regardless.

1962
02:29:21,545 --> 02:29:22,746
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'm not saying you don't need the vehicles.

1963
02:29:22,766 --> 02:29:29,390
[SPEAKER_16]: But I believe that the mayor has been working on other things for ARPA funding.

1964
02:29:29,590 --> 02:29:38,456
[SPEAKER_16]: We actually, engineering and DPW, more so engineering, has put forth so many projects that are eligible for ARPA.

1965
02:29:39,056 --> 02:29:42,098
[SPEAKER_16]: ARPA has a lot of things that are favorable when it comes to sort of like

1966
02:29:42,555 --> 02:29:46,419
[SPEAKER_16]: waterline projects and street improvements and things like that, that kind of go together.

1967
02:29:47,380 --> 02:29:54,868
[SPEAKER_16]: Buying vehicles, I think, yeah, there are other options for funding, but this is the one that was selected, so.

1968
02:29:55,509 --> 02:30:00,414
[SPEAKER_09]: I would have rather spent the upper funds $600,000 on this than $600,000 on parking meters.

1969
02:30:02,236 --> 02:30:05,379
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe, it's, again, it's not my decision, but I will- There's a lot better use of the money.

1970
02:30:06,657 --> 02:30:13,722
[SPEAKER_16]: I, you know, I don't, I don't know.

1971
02:30:14,162 --> 02:30:24,088
[SPEAKER_16]: I will say that ARPA, from my understanding of the whole process, I don't necessarily think that these would be good purchases with ARPA because of the other flexibilities that ARPA has.

1972
02:30:24,648 --> 02:30:33,314
[SPEAKER_16]: And also to other points that were made tonight, we really need to get into the groove as a city making routine vehicle purchases.

1973
02:30:33,394 --> 02:30:33,734
[SPEAKER_09]: I came in.

1974
02:30:35,685 --> 02:30:35,965
[SPEAKER_16]: What's that?

1975
02:30:36,125 --> 02:30:36,825
[SPEAKER_09]: You're 100% right.

1976
02:30:36,945 --> 02:30:44,248
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, and so this is, you know, there was a few years where we weren't buying vehicles and Mr. Wentzell can tell you about that and what that has done.

1977
02:30:44,468 --> 02:30:47,489
[SPEAKER_16]: So this is, you know, we're really trying to get on track here.

1978
02:30:47,529 --> 02:30:58,052
[SPEAKER_09]: So hopefully this can be- So this goes to our discussion earlier this evening, capital plan, a piecemeal, and we got three pieces of a capital plan tonight.

1979
02:30:59,443 --> 02:31:00,604
[SPEAKER_09]: instead of a whole capital plan.

1980
02:31:01,285 --> 02:31:04,248
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure, but these are elements that were on the previous capital plan.

1981
02:31:04,268 --> 02:31:05,630
[SPEAKER_16]: So these aren't necessarily new.

1982
02:31:07,527 --> 02:31:11,210
[SPEAKER_16]: Out of all the things that you've seen tonight, these actually were on the previous capital plan?

1983
02:31:11,230 --> 02:31:12,611
[SPEAKER_16]: We haven't seen a capital plan yet.

1984
02:31:12,631 --> 02:31:15,393
[SPEAKER_16]: So the one that you've already received a few years ago, a couple years ago.

1985
02:31:15,413 --> 02:31:17,434
[SPEAKER_16]: A few years ago, yeah.

1986
02:31:18,255 --> 02:31:22,698
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been working on these five trucks for over a year.

1987
02:31:23,758 --> 02:31:29,582
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of the issues that I do have is if it doesn't get approved, and let's say it gets approved in June,

1988
02:31:30,383 --> 02:31:31,744
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a year and a half to get a truck.

1989
02:31:32,465 --> 02:31:35,167
[SPEAKER_07]: These trucks are here now.

1990
02:31:35,227 --> 02:31:36,548
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll be ready within a few weeks.

1991
02:31:38,069 --> 02:31:42,372
[SPEAKER_09]: This goes back till we get the jam down our throat in the last second again.

1992
02:31:42,973 --> 02:31:44,114
[SPEAKER_09]: This is what we do all the time.

1993
02:31:44,494 --> 02:31:45,114
[SPEAKER_09]: Last second.

1994
02:31:45,375 --> 02:31:47,216
[SPEAKER_09]: You got to do it tonight or we lose it.

1995
02:31:48,237 --> 02:31:49,037
[SPEAKER_09]: Tired of this.

1996
02:31:49,578 --> 02:31:50,378
[SPEAKER_09]: Freaking tired of this.

1997
02:31:50,398 --> 02:31:51,699
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all we do.

1998
02:31:52,020 --> 02:31:52,940
[SPEAKER_09]: Rush, rush, rush.

1999
02:31:55,722 --> 02:31:58,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Madam Chief of Staff, were you able to speak to the opera question?

2000
02:31:58,224 --> 02:31:58,905
[SPEAKER_03]: I see your hand up.

2001
02:32:00,178 --> 02:32:01,119
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Morell.

2002
02:32:01,620 --> 02:32:06,365
[SPEAKER_18]: I was simply going to say again that this would fall into the same category.

2003
02:32:06,405 --> 02:32:16,735
[SPEAKER_18]: These vehicles would have to go under revenue replacement and couldn't fall under the categories that were outlined by the federal government in terms of

2004
02:32:18,042 --> 02:32:20,765
[SPEAKER_18]: the different requirements.

2005
02:32:20,925 --> 02:32:22,486
[SPEAKER_18]: Each one of them would have to be analyzed.

2006
02:32:22,586 --> 02:32:32,375
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't want to speak to the street sweeper, for instance, but I suspect that I don't recall a category for vehicles and I don't recall that as an eligible use.

2007
02:32:32,435 --> 02:32:34,697
[SPEAKER_18]: Again, it could probably fall under revenue replacement.

2008
02:32:36,399 --> 02:32:38,381
[SPEAKER_18]: And the only other comment I'll say is, look,

2009
02:32:40,332 --> 02:32:46,798
[SPEAKER_18]: In this case, you know, there are vehicles that are on order, but I don't think we've used the words that these have to be voted tonight at any time.

2010
02:32:46,878 --> 02:32:57,287
[SPEAKER_18]: These particular vehicles are time sensitive because our fleet superintendent has done a tremendous job working to secure these types of vehicles.

2011
02:32:57,408 --> 02:33:00,070
[SPEAKER_18]: But again, I don't think we've used the words that these have to be used.

2012
02:33:00,110 --> 02:33:01,091
[SPEAKER_18]: They have to be voted tonight.

2013
02:33:01,231 --> 02:33:01,551
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2014
02:33:02,372 --> 02:33:02,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

2015
02:33:02,712 --> 02:33:05,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Any further questions on BEARS?

2016
02:33:06,433 --> 02:33:11,302
[SPEAKER_13]: I think my comment on timing may have seemed esoteric, but it's very direct to this point.

2017
02:33:12,140 --> 02:33:12,340
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

2018
02:33:12,400 --> 02:33:14,040
[SPEAKER_13]: So we know free cash got certified today.

2019
02:33:14,281 --> 02:33:15,761
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm hearing you say there's trucks available.

2020
02:33:15,801 --> 02:33:16,561
[SPEAKER_13]: We can get them in weeks.

2021
02:33:16,721 --> 02:33:19,022
[SPEAKER_13]: If we delay a couple of months, we're not going to get trucks for 18 months.

2022
02:33:19,642 --> 02:33:21,542
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a bad situation to be in.

2023
02:33:22,562 --> 02:33:24,503
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't want to do that to you guys.

2024
02:33:24,903 --> 02:33:25,143
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

2025
02:33:25,283 --> 02:33:26,883
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm going to vote for the damn thing.

2026
02:33:27,384 --> 02:33:34,645
[SPEAKER_13]: But like if we had had a conversation about capital expenses over a period of time and said, hey, we have a bunch of urgent needs.

2027
02:33:34,705 --> 02:33:36,426
[SPEAKER_13]: We're doing the procurement and acquisition.

2028
02:33:36,786 --> 02:33:39,066
[SPEAKER_13]: We're not going to have free cash certified till the end of March.

2029
02:33:39,586 --> 02:33:41,727
[SPEAKER_13]: But here's all the things that we'd known two months ago.

2030
02:33:42,267 --> 02:33:46,290
[SPEAKER_13]: then Rick's not sitting here saying it's the last minute getting shoved down our throats when that is what it is.

2031
02:33:46,791 --> 02:33:47,892
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're in that situation.

2032
02:33:47,932 --> 02:33:49,613
[SPEAKER_13]: And basically, we have to be in that situation.

2033
02:33:49,833 --> 02:33:56,899
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, again, I come when I make my determination on this, I'm like, I don't want to screw over the fleet people, right?

2034
02:33:57,079 --> 02:34:00,862
[SPEAKER_13]: When I don't want to screw over the fire department, I don't want to screw over anybody here.

2035
02:34:01,263 --> 02:34:05,986
[SPEAKER_13]: But I'm just, you know, I'm like, this close to being where he's at, on all of it, where it's like,

2036
02:34:06,807 --> 02:34:16,255
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just about the collaborative and communication process and making sure that information is presented in a way where you guys don't have to come up here and say, hey, we know it's the last minute.

2037
02:34:16,475 --> 02:34:19,938
[SPEAKER_13]: We only have a certain amount of time to acquire these products.

2038
02:34:20,138 --> 02:34:22,600
[SPEAKER_13]: It's again, I'm going to vote.

2039
02:34:23,601 --> 02:34:23,861
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

2040
02:34:24,842 --> 02:34:29,045
[SPEAKER_13]: And I can hear the tension in your voice because you're hearing, oh, my God, it's going to get delayed and then we're going to be in real trouble.

2041
02:34:29,105 --> 02:34:31,867
[SPEAKER_13]: And that shouldn't be on you guys to have to come here and justify that.

2042
02:34:32,428 --> 02:34:32,568
[SPEAKER_13]: So.

2043
02:34:33,108 --> 02:34:49,563
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to vote for it, but that's the frustration is like if we had a real process in place where information was coming in in a timely manner and we were getting what we need, then we would be having these conversations weeks or months in advance instead of hours or days in advance and then there wouldn't be the frustration that I'm hearing from my colleagues.

2044
02:34:49,643 --> 02:34:51,205
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you for your presentation.

2045
02:34:51,871 --> 02:34:54,373
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just wanted to speak on the fire department pickup.

2046
02:34:55,573 --> 02:35:04,339
[SPEAKER_15]: Over the years, we've lost several vehicles due to corrosion and I had to get rid of them, put them out of service because they were unsafe.

2047
02:35:05,079 --> 02:35:12,084
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we have a 20 year old pickup truck that's rear wheel drive that should have never been used for what it's being used for.

2048
02:35:12,924 --> 02:35:15,926
[SPEAKER_15]: And that, it has multiple,

2049
02:35:18,047 --> 02:35:19,247
[SPEAKER_15]: excuse me, multiple uses.

2050
02:35:19,908 --> 02:35:23,149
[SPEAKER_15]: And this pickup is going to sort of replace the one we lost.

2051
02:35:23,829 --> 02:35:26,810
[SPEAKER_15]: The pickup with the rear wheel drive is now going to be four wheel drive.

2052
02:35:27,290 --> 02:35:34,073
[SPEAKER_15]: So it does, it does in the wintertime, it tows the ice, the ice sled around in the summer when we do the smokehouse, it does that.

2053
02:35:34,693 --> 02:35:35,973
[SPEAKER_15]: And then it's going to have a plow on it.

2054
02:35:36,013 --> 02:35:42,216
[SPEAKER_15]: So when the other plow breaks, we have a plow, we can continue to plow the stations because we do our all the rear parts of our stations.

2055
02:35:42,256 --> 02:35:43,436
[SPEAKER_15]: The DPW helps us out

2056
02:35:43,910 --> 02:35:47,875
[SPEAKER_15]: with salt and things like that but we have our own plow that we take care of our own stations.

2057
02:35:48,555 --> 02:36:02,952
[SPEAKER_15]: So, having a second one when that one breaks, and then also having multiple it's going to have multiple uses towing the boat around telling the trailer around and safe with four wheel drive and the winter time so when they back down the ramp with the ice sled they don't

2058
02:36:03,485 --> 02:36:04,206
[SPEAKER_15]: get stuck there.

2059
02:36:04,346 --> 02:36:04,506
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

2060
02:36:04,846 --> 02:36:04,986
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.

2061
02:36:05,007 --> 02:36:05,847
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a lot safer in general.

2062
02:36:05,867 --> 02:36:08,330
[SPEAKER_13]: If there's an accident 20 years newer than the last one.

2063
02:36:09,130 --> 02:36:18,379
[SPEAKER_15]: And like I said, we got rid of all those other vehicles, you know, over time, it just kind of culminated where, and then this truck became available.

2064
02:36:18,399 --> 02:36:24,125
[SPEAKER_15]: What happened was we ordered it and then it didn't come in for the longest time.

2065
02:36:24,633 --> 02:36:28,174
[SPEAKER_15]: So we canceled the PO we ordered a different truck from a different dealership.

2066
02:36:28,815 --> 02:36:33,856
[SPEAKER_15]: And then fast forward to today the truck comes in, and they call me up like hey your truck is here.

2067
02:36:34,257 --> 02:36:39,999
[SPEAKER_15]: So, we can, if we approve this that truck is going to be here in days, not weeks.

2068
02:36:40,859 --> 02:36:51,243
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's real relief again I just wanted to just kind of hammer those points so you understand well why we're coming forward with this now, every item here in this paper is a good thing for the city that advances the goals that we share for the city.

2069
02:36:52,285 --> 02:37:04,365
[SPEAKER_13]: And you don't have to, I appreciate the timeline stuff, because that's helpful for us to know, because, you know, we hear that from you guys on your end who are on the ground acquiring, you know, looking at the conditions of what we have now acquiring the new stuff, that's all helpful.

2070
02:37:04,944 --> 02:37:24,188
[SPEAKER_15]: So I don't think any of our objections, and I don't want to speak for everybody are about the substance of this, and again I said I'm going to vote for it, it's, it's just the one last thing I'll cut you off but when I reached out to the mayor is like we implored her to try to take advantage of this again she heard me loud and clear and that's why we're here, and that's why I gotta applaud her for that you know she

2071
02:37:24,728 --> 02:37:26,950
[SPEAKER_15]: She saw it and put it in the paper you do some talking for us chief.

2072
02:37:27,511 --> 02:37:39,642
[SPEAKER_15]: What's that and you do some talking for us, maybe she'll hear you loud and rest loud and through you, I think voting tonight on my trucks that's a huge relief that it's it's 820 days away but if we don't start that clock.

2073
02:37:40,152 --> 02:37:45,578
[SPEAKER_17]: It's never going to get worse bad politics is not going to translate the bad governance, we're going to make sure that you guys are safe.

2074
02:37:45,999 --> 02:37:46,559
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

2075
02:37:46,639 --> 02:37:49,102
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the address your address my question.

2076
02:37:49,122 --> 02:37:54,888
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just it's just the, you know, again, I appreciate you giving us the pitch on these good things and hearing all the details and information.

2077
02:37:55,449 --> 02:38:01,195
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just really like, I don't think the issue is that these are not necessary or they don't need to be data now or the timeline is here.

2078
02:38:01,215 --> 02:38:01,696
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just like,

2079
02:38:02,221 --> 02:38:04,423
[SPEAKER_13]: Mike probably knew two months ago, the timeline, right?

2080
02:38:04,583 --> 02:38:07,946
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, and probably communicated that to the administration, but it never got communicated to us.

2081
02:38:08,386 --> 02:38:11,249
[SPEAKER_13]: And there can be exceptions where you get a call from a dealership and we want to take advantage of it.

2082
02:38:11,269 --> 02:38:12,109
[SPEAKER_13]: I have no problem with that.

2083
02:38:12,550 --> 02:38:14,431
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm glad that timeliness is happening, but.

2084
02:38:14,912 --> 02:38:19,956
[SPEAKER_07]: And unfortunately in our line of business, we need vehicles and equipment to be able to do our job.

2085
02:38:19,996 --> 02:38:20,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, of course.

2086
02:38:20,857 --> 02:38:21,637
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah.

2087
02:38:21,657 --> 02:38:21,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2088
02:38:21,918 --> 02:38:25,581
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a couple of important factors here that we went a couple of years without buying vehicles.

2089
02:38:25,761 --> 02:38:30,285
[SPEAKER_16]: And then also we got, we got the next year's round of vehicles lined up as well.

2090
02:38:30,805 --> 02:38:44,177
[SPEAKER_16]: So, you know, like I was saying about the sidewalk, you know, these need to be purchased, A, because if we go into the year and a half without having these vehicles, then we're not looking out for our employees.

2091
02:38:44,237 --> 02:38:44,938
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, yeah.

2092
02:38:45,178 --> 02:38:46,840
[SPEAKER_13]: There's no dispute on that.

2093
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:55,628
[SPEAKER_16]: I know, I know, but I just don't like, this is not the, it's just my opinion, but this is not one where we want to,

2094
02:38:56,552 --> 02:38:57,032
[SPEAKER_16]: delay.

2095
02:38:57,192 --> 02:38:57,393
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

2096
02:38:57,433 --> 02:39:00,074
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's already been delayed that we're trying to get this on here.

2097
02:39:00,494 --> 02:39:07,238
[SPEAKER_16]: It's been, you know, Mike's been doing a ton of work with the vendors to try to, you know, make sure that we're lining things up.

2098
02:39:07,498 --> 02:39:11,019
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's been quite an adventure getting here tonight.

2099
02:39:11,240 --> 02:39:16,362
[SPEAKER_16]: And with the last meetings, delays and all this, I think this was supposed to be on a month ago.

2100
02:39:17,263 --> 02:39:17,823
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's

2101
02:39:18,521 --> 02:39:31,805
[SPEAKER_16]: It hasn't now we're here today and, you know, so anyway, I'm not sure I could say much more but I think talking about the safety of employees, making sure that we have the tools we need to do our job, then this is, this is the meat of that.

2102
02:39:31,965 --> 02:39:34,466
[SPEAKER_13]: No, you didn't say this sorry.

2103
02:39:36,166 --> 02:39:37,646
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, very quickly.

2104
02:39:37,847 --> 02:39:40,767
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just you said, I don't think this is the one to do this on.

2105
02:39:41,267 --> 02:39:41,408
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

2106
02:39:41,648 --> 02:39:42,868
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm not trying to put words in your mouth.

2107
02:39:42,888 --> 02:39:46,129
[SPEAKER_13]: I just think that really captures the full scope of the whole thing.

2108
02:39:46,769 --> 02:39:53,551
[SPEAKER_13]: It shouldn't be that we're picking and choosing which one we're going to hold and which one we're not because we have a disagreement around knowing the information in a timely manner.

2109
02:39:53,651 --> 02:39:54,511
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's the issue.

2110
02:39:54,891 --> 02:39:58,472
[SPEAKER_13]: And you didn't say that I said that, but it really just captured the crux of the whole thing for me.

2111
02:39:58,872 --> 02:40:00,973
[SPEAKER_13]: You guys come up here and they're like, which one is it going to be tonight?

2112
02:40:01,575 --> 02:40:04,958
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's not the position you should be in, and it's not the position we want to be in.

2113
02:40:05,138 --> 02:40:06,499
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'll just leave it at that.

2114
02:40:06,559 --> 02:40:06,900
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

2115
02:40:07,320 --> 02:40:07,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight.

2116
02:40:09,322 --> 02:40:09,582
[SPEAKER_17]: Tim.

2117
02:40:10,002 --> 02:40:10,182
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

2118
02:40:11,143 --> 02:40:14,686
[SPEAKER_17]: We absolutely stink at street sweeping.

2119
02:40:16,147 --> 02:40:16,988
[SPEAKER_17]: We are awful at it.

2120
02:40:17,609 --> 02:40:20,111
[SPEAKER_17]: It is something we are not good at in this city at all.

2121
02:40:20,831 --> 02:40:25,415
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm looking at this expense and I'm seeing it total more than half of the total expenses before us.

2122
02:40:25,455 --> 02:40:28,798
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd like to see us get 10 trucks and forget the street sweeper.

2123
02:40:30,280 --> 02:40:34,401
[SPEAKER_17]: Quite frankly, I don't see any value in the program that we're running right now.

2124
02:40:34,721 --> 02:40:37,822
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it can be done much better and probably cheaper privately.

2125
02:40:39,703 --> 02:40:45,244
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, so when I look at this and streets we've been since since you've been here, since you've lived in the city street sweep has been an issue.

2126
02:40:45,604 --> 02:40:50,846
[SPEAKER_17]: We are not good at it this twice a year thing is a waste in my opinion I don't think it does anything to help beautify the city.

2127
02:40:51,566 --> 02:40:54,047
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think that it really meets any objectives and goals other than

2128
02:40:54,707 --> 02:41:00,991
[SPEAKER_17]: making people totally angry because of the notification system and the getting told I'm not getting told some streets do some streets don't.

2129
02:41:01,431 --> 02:41:03,252
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just a haphazard application.

2130
02:41:04,173 --> 02:41:09,416
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, you're in zone one today and we're doing the best we can with what we got without the full blown program.

2131
02:41:09,896 --> 02:41:10,797
[SPEAKER_17]: We're just not good at it.

2132
02:41:11,237 --> 02:41:12,098
[SPEAKER_17]: We're just not good at it.

2133
02:41:12,518 --> 02:41:16,160
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there you know, I'm one that would never say send something out

2134
02:41:16,702 --> 02:41:18,403
[SPEAKER_17]: unless we're replacing it with something we're doing in-house.

2135
02:41:18,903 --> 02:41:27,547
[SPEAKER_17]: But I'm thinking the amount of money and funds that we spend on the Street Sweeper program could probably be better invested if we gave it, put it out, it could probably be cheaper.

2136
02:41:27,607 --> 02:41:32,309
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we could do more internally, hiring more equipment and trucks and plows and stuff like that.

2137
02:41:33,569 --> 02:41:38,532
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I'm looking at this and I'm saying, the thing really, it comes out twice a year, right?

2138
02:41:38,572 --> 02:41:39,092
[SPEAKER_17]: The Street Sweeper?

2139
02:41:40,102 --> 02:41:41,023
[SPEAKER_07]: goes out every night.

2140
02:41:41,923 --> 02:41:43,524
[SPEAKER_07]: On the main drags, on the main drags only.

2141
02:41:43,584 --> 02:41:44,765
[SPEAKER_07]: April 1st and November 15th.

2142
02:41:44,825 --> 02:41:45,826
[SPEAKER_07]: On the main drags only.

2143
02:41:45,986 --> 02:41:46,326
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

2144
02:41:46,366 --> 02:41:50,189
[SPEAKER_17]: But I live on a main drag, and I'm gonna tell you, last year it didn't come out every night.

2145
02:41:50,909 --> 02:41:52,790
[SPEAKER_17]: The year before that, it didn't come out every night.

2146
02:41:53,231 --> 02:41:53,651
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what I mean?

2147
02:41:53,671 --> 02:41:54,551
[SPEAKER_17]: Because I live on a main drag.

2148
02:41:54,571 --> 02:41:55,832
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's not doing every street every night.

2149
02:41:55,852 --> 02:41:56,673
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a schedule.

2150
02:41:56,853 --> 02:41:57,733
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

2151
02:41:57,753 --> 02:42:02,957
[SPEAKER_17]: So why can't I, so I get a pack of restrictions on my street, it's supposed to get swept, but it doesn't get swept.

2152
02:42:03,597 --> 02:42:04,978
[SPEAKER_17]: But you know what I mean?

2153
02:42:05,098 --> 02:42:05,879
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not a good program.

2154
02:42:06,619 --> 02:42:11,601
[SPEAKER_16]: I haven't done the cost analysis that you're referring to, in-house, out-house.

2155
02:42:11,661 --> 02:42:12,522
[SPEAKER_16]: We do rent a couple.

2156
02:42:12,922 --> 02:42:13,662
[SPEAKER_16]: So we have two.

2157
02:42:13,682 --> 02:42:16,103
[SPEAKER_16]: So when we do this big sweep, we do rent a couple.

2158
02:42:16,583 --> 02:42:17,544
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's a bit of a hybrid.

2159
02:42:18,364 --> 02:42:24,967
[SPEAKER_16]: And I would say that this particular one, the grant required us to dispose of the one that we have that it's replacing.

2160
02:42:25,007 --> 02:42:26,187
[SPEAKER_16]: So it goes to all electric.

2161
02:42:27,008 --> 02:42:29,649
[SPEAKER_16]: So that was the decision that was made.

2162
02:42:30,149 --> 02:42:32,910
[SPEAKER_16]: And then the decision was made to match it here.

2163
02:42:33,050 --> 02:42:34,511
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that a fleet decision or is that a?

2164
02:42:35,401 --> 02:42:36,301
[SPEAKER_16]: PDS decision.

2165
02:42:36,841 --> 02:42:42,503
[SPEAKER_16]: The fleet decision is that we have sweepers that work and we can use them.

2166
02:42:43,463 --> 02:42:50,585
[SPEAKER_16]: It wasn't necessarily a decision by us to go out and get the grant for electric street sweepers.

2167
02:42:50,625 --> 02:42:53,766
[SPEAKER_16]: But that's what happened and that's what we have to deal with.

2168
02:42:54,566 --> 02:42:58,107
[SPEAKER_16]: So with that said, we need the second sweeper.

2169
02:42:59,127 --> 02:43:00,288
[SPEAKER_16]: And I will just also say too,

2170
02:43:02,137 --> 02:43:03,898
[SPEAKER_16]: A lot of people don't realize this, but I'll just say it.

2171
02:43:03,978 --> 02:43:09,279
[SPEAKER_16]: The reason we sweep twice a year, one of the reasons anyway is regulatory compliance, because our water goes into the river.

2172
02:43:09,640 --> 02:43:13,721
[SPEAKER_16]: So getting the sediment off the roads is a big piece of that.

2173
02:43:14,041 --> 02:43:15,622
[SPEAKER_16]: So there is a regulatory piece as well.

2174
02:43:15,862 --> 02:43:17,382
[SPEAKER_16]: We need to be sweeping the streets twice a year.

2175
02:43:17,742 --> 02:43:19,023
[SPEAKER_16]: We can get better at it for sure.

2176
02:43:19,063 --> 02:43:20,403
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's a different conversation.

2177
02:43:20,743 --> 02:43:23,184
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm more than happy to continue that conversation.

2178
02:43:23,204 --> 02:43:25,725
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm always looking to make our operations.

2179
02:43:26,385 --> 02:43:28,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I said- So we have two sweepers.

2180
02:43:29,206 --> 02:43:30,267
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a 2013 and a- This is like,

2181
02:43:31,887 --> 02:43:34,009
[SPEAKER_07]: a foreign language to me, you know what I mean?

2182
02:43:34,029 --> 02:43:35,089
[SPEAKER_07]: 20 tons and this and that, I don't know.

2183
02:43:35,169 --> 02:43:40,593
[SPEAKER_07]: I only know that when they take the thing out- We have a 13 and an 18 and they say the average lifespan is five years.

2184
02:43:41,354 --> 02:43:49,059
[SPEAKER_07]: So what we normally do is after the, when the second one, the newest one becomes five years old, we rotate it.

2185
02:43:49,540 --> 02:43:59,327
[SPEAKER_07]: I was able to apply for a grant to where we could get a electric street sweeper for the same price as a gas street sweeper to do the rotation, that's all.

2186
02:44:08,408 --> 02:44:10,609
[SPEAKER_03]: The one and the two are each item within one.

2187
02:44:13,930 --> 02:44:14,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Caraviello.

2188
02:44:14,830 --> 02:44:15,390
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

2189
02:44:16,270 --> 02:44:17,170
[SPEAKER_09]: On the electric sweeper.

2190
02:44:17,210 --> 02:44:23,712
[SPEAKER_09]: Who repairs that when it breaks?

2191
02:44:24,252 --> 02:44:24,892
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you capable?

2192
02:44:24,972 --> 02:44:30,453
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm actually sending my mechanics to electric sweeper school.

2193
02:44:32,002 --> 02:44:33,743
[SPEAKER_07]: The manufacturer is providing school.

2194
02:44:34,283 --> 02:44:38,305
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything that we can't handle, it will go back to the manufacturer.

2195
02:44:38,585 --> 02:44:40,725
[SPEAKER_09]: How long will that run before it needs to be charged again?

2196
02:44:42,526 --> 02:44:43,526
[SPEAKER_07]: The sweeper?

2197
02:44:43,546 --> 02:44:43,786
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2198
02:44:44,107 --> 02:44:44,367
[SPEAKER_07]: 12 hours.

2199
02:44:44,387 --> 02:44:45,007
[SPEAKER_09]: 12 hours.

2200
02:44:45,467 --> 02:44:49,468
[SPEAKER_09]: And is it as powerful as the diesel and picking up wet leaves?

2201
02:44:49,949 --> 02:44:50,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2202
02:44:51,889 --> 02:44:53,790
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually easier to fix, believe it or not.

2203
02:44:54,035 --> 02:45:02,018
[SPEAKER_09]: No, but is it, when it goes around picking up leaves, when we do that, a big sweep, where people throw them all over the side of the road, and they pile them up, will that?

2204
02:45:02,358 --> 02:45:16,004
[SPEAKER_07]: It has a different design than the Elgin, to where it has a vacuum portion of it too, so it'll actually, and the conveyor on the machine is different, so it actually, it won't clog as bad as the Elgin still.

2205
02:45:16,724 --> 02:45:17,745
[SPEAKER_09]: And what's the lifespan of that?

2206
02:45:18,785 --> 02:45:19,486
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no idea.

2207
02:45:19,986 --> 02:45:22,427
[SPEAKER_07]: They're giving me a five year warranty on the machine, so.

2208
02:45:23,312 --> 02:45:24,273
[SPEAKER_09]: or my parts and labor?

2209
02:45:24,393 --> 02:45:29,817
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so I would imagine longer than that.

2210
02:45:29,877 --> 02:45:36,822
[SPEAKER_07]: They do have wearable items, just like the gas sweeper, the brooms, and you know, the different tubes and stuff like that.

2211
02:45:36,842 --> 02:45:38,043
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, normal wearables.

2212
02:45:38,063 --> 02:45:39,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, regular maintenance items.

2213
02:45:40,784 --> 02:45:40,985
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

2214
02:45:41,005 --> 02:45:46,569
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm not 100% sure, but I believe the batteries on it are a lifetime warranty.

2215
02:45:47,529 --> 02:45:49,070
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'd have to check on that.

2216
02:45:50,431 --> 02:45:51,092
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thank you.

2217
02:45:53,159 --> 02:45:54,840
[SPEAKER_03]: for the discussion from the council on this paper.

2218
02:45:56,440 --> 02:45:58,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Madam Chief of staff, I see you with your hand up.

2219
02:45:59,081 --> 02:46:00,282
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Morell.

2220
02:46:01,402 --> 02:46:12,987
[SPEAKER_18]: Just want to point out that while I recognize that a capital improvements plan update is needed, there was a 2021 to 2026 plan, which was referred to tonight, which includes these items.

2221
02:46:13,647 --> 02:46:15,168
[SPEAKER_02]: So just want to point that out.

2222
02:46:15,208 --> 02:46:15,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

2223
02:46:17,369 --> 02:46:17,689
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

2224
02:46:17,709 --> 02:46:22,651
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have a motion from Councilor Knight to sever

2225
02:46:25,501 --> 02:46:26,061
[SPEAKER_03]: of a second.

2226
02:46:26,101 --> 02:46:28,262
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are severing just the first bullet point.

2227
02:46:31,262 --> 02:46:32,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Second, Councilor Pele.

2228
02:46:32,263 --> 02:46:34,743
[SPEAKER_03]: So motion is to sever the first bullet point of number one.

2229
02:46:34,823 --> 02:46:36,384
[SPEAKER_03]: So the street sweeper, $378,453.90.

2230
02:46:36,584 --> 02:46:45,626
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a motion for that from Councilor Nunez to sever a second by Councilor Pele.

2231
02:46:46,246 --> 02:46:46,866
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

2232
02:46:48,286 --> 02:46:48,987
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

2233
02:46:49,067 --> 02:46:49,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

2234
02:46:49,787 --> 02:46:52,147
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll take that one first.

2235
02:46:52,907 --> 02:46:55,028
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if I have a motion to, I need a motion.

2236
02:46:56,535 --> 02:46:57,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to approve what?

2237
02:46:59,537 --> 02:47:00,137
[SPEAKER_03]: The street sweeper.

2238
02:47:00,177 --> 02:47:06,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so on the motion of Councilor Collins to approve the $378,453.90 for 55% of the cost of an electric street sweeper, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

2239
02:47:06,661 --> 02:47:07,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2240
02:47:30,527 --> 02:47:32,367
[SPEAKER_03]: This is for the street sweeper only.

2241
02:47:32,387 --> 02:47:33,208
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yes.

2242
02:47:33,388 --> 02:47:33,888
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

2243
02:47:33,948 --> 02:47:34,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

2244
02:47:34,468 --> 02:47:34,808
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

2245
02:47:35,128 --> 02:47:35,308
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

2246
02:47:37,049 --> 02:47:37,269
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

2247
02:47:37,369 --> 02:47:45,031
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been the affirmative to and the negative motion passes.

2248
02:47:52,059 --> 02:48:00,905
[SPEAKER_03]: on the motion of Councilor Collins to approve the remainder of the free cash request under, it's just item one, just item one?

2249
02:48:02,405 --> 02:48:07,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, under item one, seconded by Vice-President Bears.

2250
02:48:08,990 --> 02:48:12,111
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, this is just for item one, so the remainder of the items.

2251
02:48:12,131 --> 02:48:18,976
[SPEAKER_03]: The clerk's still writing stuff, so I was gonna say it, so I'll be quiet, so he can think while he writes.

2252
02:48:44,476 --> 02:48:59,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, six in the affirmative one in the negative motion passes on the motion Councilor Collins to approve the second item.

2253
02:49:03,018 --> 02:49:04,099
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

2254
02:49:04,359 --> 02:49:08,400
[SPEAKER_17]: This paper that's before us this evening is attached to a paper that we voted on previously.

2255
02:49:08,440 --> 02:49:10,541
[SPEAKER_17]: The paper that we voted on previously requires three readings.

2256
02:49:11,461 --> 02:49:14,942
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'd ask that in the paper that we voted on previously, we amend it.

2257
02:49:15,402 --> 02:49:16,842
[SPEAKER_17]: So the dollar figure is not gonna be the same.

2258
02:49:16,862 --> 02:49:28,326
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'd ask that this paper be tabled and that the administration give us an amended paper that reflects the appropriate dollar figure based upon the vote that the council took earlier, excluding the mayor's office and the city council from the cost of living adjustment that the mayor's office proposed for themselves.

2259
02:49:29,606 --> 02:49:30,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Second.

2260
02:49:30,527 --> 02:49:31,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Second, okay.

2261
02:49:32,163 --> 02:49:43,693
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a motion from Councilor Knight to table the paper and are requesting an updated figure from the administration reflecting the amendments we made from the paper that this is tied to, seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

2262
02:49:44,995 --> 02:49:47,917
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

2263
02:49:48,237 --> 02:49:48,398
Aye.

2264
02:49:48,458 --> 02:49:49,559
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

2265
02:49:49,619 --> 02:49:50,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

2266
02:49:50,459 --> 02:49:51,240
[SPEAKER_03]: Paper is tabled.

2267
02:49:52,221 --> 02:49:53,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Get that information.

2268
02:49:53,062 --> 02:49:56,145
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, number is this.

2269
02:49:56,165 --> 02:49:56,185
[SPEAKER_03]: 23-061.

2270
02:49:59,442 --> 02:50:18,543
[SPEAKER_03]: to my role president and members of the Medford City Council regarding stabilization fund establishment and funding your present morale and members of the city council I respectfully request and recommend that your body establish a general stabilization fund as authorized by chapter 40 section five B of general laws and vote to appropriate free cash in the amount of $5 million and you said fun.

2271
02:50:19,023 --> 02:50:25,584
[SPEAKER_03]: The vast majority of cities and towns in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts have a general stabilization fund in order to provide for emergencies and unforeseen expenses.

2272
02:50:26,204 --> 02:50:31,125
[SPEAKER_03]: A two thirds majority of the city council is required to establish and to appropriate funds into the stabilization fund.

2273
02:50:31,986 --> 02:50:33,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Respectfully submitted Brandon Lungo-Koehn mayor.

2274
02:50:33,826 --> 02:50:38,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to hear from Director Dickinson first or do you want to?

2275
02:50:38,387 --> 02:50:48,529
[SPEAKER_03]: Director Dickinson, could you just provide some background for what's before us and also for folks who may not have seen the press release that went out, let us know how much free cash we have right now.

2276
02:50:49,045 --> 02:50:49,725
[SPEAKER_03]: that is certified?

2277
02:50:53,667 --> 02:51:00,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, as of today, we have slightly over $25 million in free cash that has been certified by the state.

2278
02:51:01,611 --> 02:51:05,753
[SPEAKER_04]: The purpose of a stabilization fund, this isn't money that we are spending.

2279
02:51:05,773 --> 02:51:08,975
[SPEAKER_04]: This is money that we are accounting for differently.

2280
02:51:10,451 --> 02:51:16,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, as we all know, or well, sorry, it's late.

2281
02:51:17,057 --> 02:51:23,043
[SPEAKER_04]: As, as I know, um, our free cash certification only lasts until June 30th, 2023.

2282
02:51:23,163 --> 02:51:25,825
[SPEAKER_04]: So the $25 million that we have right now that we can use, we can vote.

2283
02:51:31,610 --> 02:51:49,814
[SPEAKER_04]: to use as free cash that expires on June 30th, 2023 and will not be available again until free cash is certified for July 1st of 2023, which would this year, obviously that took nine months.

2284
02:51:51,455 --> 02:51:54,776
[SPEAKER_04]: The purpose of the stabilization fund would be simply to move $5 million there.

2285
02:51:54,836 --> 02:51:54,936
[SPEAKER_04]: So if

2286
02:51:57,567 --> 02:52:20,333
[SPEAKER_04]: An emergency or another unforeseen circumstance arose when we did not have free cash certified because we hadn't closed the books on the prior year, that the city council would be able to, with a two thirds vote, use the stabilization fund to fund whatever emergency we might have.

2287
02:52:21,733 --> 02:52:25,634
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why most cities and towns actually have a stabilization fund.

2288
02:52:26,783 --> 02:52:29,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it makes the money available.

2289
02:52:29,606 --> 02:52:32,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, it's not money that we are spending on anything.

2290
02:52:32,408 --> 02:52:47,281
[SPEAKER_04]: It simply allows us to put some money aside so that if an emergency shows up when we don't have free cash certified that the city council can then vote to use that money to deal with the emergency.

2291
02:52:47,301 --> 02:52:49,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

2292
02:52:50,461 --> 02:52:53,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Madam President, Vice President Bears and then Councilor Carbonell.

2293
02:52:53,483 --> 02:52:54,504
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Madam President.

2294
02:52:54,544 --> 02:52:56,226
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for the explanation, Director Dickinson.

2295
02:52:56,266 --> 02:52:57,987
[SPEAKER_13]: I appreciate the additional context.

2296
02:52:58,928 --> 02:53:00,929
[SPEAKER_13]: Personally, I think a stabilization fund is a great idea.

2297
02:53:00,949 --> 02:53:05,253
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just a little wary of the process.

2298
02:53:06,154 --> 02:53:09,997
[SPEAKER_13]: I think for me, you know, we had our

2299
02:53:10,937 --> 02:53:18,100
[SPEAKER_13]: issues in the last budget where we were in a structural deficit we had many millions of dollars where we were covering it with our revenue replacement.

2300
02:53:18,960 --> 02:53:27,023
[SPEAKER_13]: We've had a discussion about the revenue side of the budget but we have not had a presentation regarding at anything as far as I've seen as us to the expense side of the budget.

2301
02:53:28,103 --> 02:53:37,906
[SPEAKER_13]: So I you know we don't know yet what the potential either structural deficit being covered by ARPA might be this year or if there, you know, is any need to use free cash to cover any, any holes in the budget.

2302
02:53:38,286 --> 02:53:48,509
[SPEAKER_13]: Hopefully neither of those things are true considering the very strong seeming presentation by director Dickinson about revenue but you know, only seen one side of the budget at best we haven't seen the expense side yet.

2303
02:53:49,569 --> 02:53:53,691
[SPEAKER_13]: It sounded to me, Bob and please correct me if I'm wrong, that.

2304
02:53:55,237 --> 02:53:58,958
[SPEAKER_13]: We have we can use since free cash is certified, we can use that through June 30.

2305
02:54:00,838 --> 02:54:10,181
[SPEAKER_13]: And given that, and again, if I'm wrong, please let me know, I would rather kind of have this discussion as part of the holistic discussion we're going to be having around the fiscal 24 budget.

2306
02:54:11,301 --> 02:54:18,643
[SPEAKER_13]: And we can kind of decide, or have a little bit more understanding of we have this amount of free cash, these are our revenue and expense expectations.

2307
02:54:19,263 --> 02:54:21,583
[SPEAKER_13]: We do or do not expect to have to use free cash.

2308
02:54:22,104 --> 02:54:28,365
[SPEAKER_13]: I just don't want to see us put $5 million into this account today when maybe it should better be sitting as free cash for a little while.

2309
02:54:28,665 --> 02:54:29,445
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, I don't know.

2310
02:54:30,085 --> 02:54:32,325
[SPEAKER_13]: But I'd like to have that conversation as part of the budget.

2311
02:54:32,765 --> 02:54:48,068
[SPEAKER_13]: Just something else I know is that there is a specific part of state law in Chapter 59, Section 21C, Subsection G, that allows cities to create specific dedicated revenue to fund stabilization funds with the approval of the voters.

2312
02:54:48,626 --> 02:54:50,948
[SPEAKER_13]: and I'd just like to have that be part of the discussion as well.

2313
02:54:51,028 --> 02:55:05,419
[SPEAKER_13]: So I personally would like to move this to a committee of the whole, where we can either discuss this on its own or discuss it as part of the fiscal 24 budget and just get that paper done by, you know, it sounds like we don't have to get it done by June 28th or June 30th.

2314
02:55:05,499 --> 02:55:06,880
[SPEAKER_13]: So that would be my motion.

2315
02:55:07,460 --> 02:55:07,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

2316
02:55:07,720 --> 02:55:10,002
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so that addressed here.

2317
02:55:10,162 --> 02:55:11,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thank you.

2318
02:55:11,923 --> 02:55:13,024
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Collins and Councilor Tseng.

2319
02:55:13,224 --> 02:55:15,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, there's a very strange sounding car outside.

2320
02:55:17,652 --> 02:55:33,006
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you President Morell and I appreciate the context around this from my fellow Councilors and from Director Dickinson and I came into the meeting.

2321
02:55:35,015 --> 02:55:37,738
[SPEAKER_14]: Ultimately, I think that a stabilization fund is a good thing for a city to have.

2322
02:55:37,758 --> 02:55:44,484
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's one of those things that we probably should have had already and it's good for it to be enacted now or at least this year.

2323
02:55:45,005 --> 02:55:47,167
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm fine with the idea of moving it into a committee of the whole.

2324
02:55:47,187 --> 02:55:55,535
[SPEAKER_14]: I do think that there's a broader scope to this discussion that I would perhaps prefer to have.

2325
02:55:55,615 --> 02:55:58,898
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think a big part of that for me is this

2326
02:56:01,606 --> 02:56:03,087
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, it is getting late.

2327
02:56:03,107 --> 02:56:04,227
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not slowing down.

2328
02:56:07,190 --> 02:56:20,019
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, this announcement of the stabilization fund request arrived at the same time as the announcement of the certification of $25 million in free cash put forth as in the posture of something to celebrate.

2329
02:56:20,039 --> 02:56:22,161
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't really think that's something to celebrate.

2330
02:56:22,721 --> 02:56:29,386
[SPEAKER_14]: You've been in a pandemic recovery for three years preparing for future emergency spending needs

2331
02:56:30,813 --> 02:56:46,397
[SPEAKER_14]: is good, but when you look at the amount of under-investment in pressing urgent needs in this community that have gone under-invested in and frankly under-acknowledged over the past few years, I'm glad if this means that we are turning a leaf towards more investing in

2332
02:56:47,888 --> 02:56:50,810
[SPEAKER_14]: urgent material needs for our community that we need right now when we need them.

2333
02:56:51,431 --> 02:56:55,514
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think this very vast overflow is evidence that we have not been good at that.

2334
02:56:56,074 --> 02:56:57,755
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think frankly, that's a source of shame.

2335
02:56:58,376 --> 02:57:13,607
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think what would make me feel better about kind of hastily throwing together a stabilization fund now is if we can get a commitment that this will also involve material investments in areas of greatest need in our community soon.

2336
02:57:14,845 --> 02:57:18,527
[SPEAKER_14]: maybe that could be an appropriation for an affordable housing trust as soon as that comes online.

2337
02:57:18,947 --> 02:57:22,929
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think that kind of thinking does make more sense in a broader discussion what we're talking about.

2338
02:57:23,489 --> 02:57:24,450
[SPEAKER_14]: What is this going to be for?

2339
02:57:24,490 --> 02:57:25,810
[SPEAKER_14]: How is this going to be funded in the future?

2340
02:57:26,231 --> 02:57:38,637
[SPEAKER_14]: And what can we expect this to be used for based on our track record of not always taking available opportunities to meet urgent needs for stabilization in our community, like the three years that we all just witnessed and lived through.

2341
02:57:39,057 --> 02:57:39,317
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2342
02:57:39,857 --> 02:57:40,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

2343
02:57:40,418 --> 02:57:40,858
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Sai.

2344
02:57:41,203 --> 02:57:41,563
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

2345
02:57:41,924 --> 02:57:46,728
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, I'm also, you know, I think, reflecting the sentiment of my colleagues here.

2346
02:57:46,988 --> 02:57:50,932
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, I think the idea of a stabilization fund is a great idea.

2347
02:57:51,632 --> 02:58:00,981
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, and certainly we talk about, um, needing to plan ahead fiscally, but, um, to commit to $5 million tonight, you know, that's big money.

2348
02:58:01,001 --> 02:58:06,626
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a significant sum that we really can't divorce from our conversation about the budget as a whole.

2349
02:58:07,066 --> 02:58:07,507
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, and

2350
02:58:08,027 --> 02:58:15,133
[SPEAKER_12]: Because it's such a big sum, we need to pay particular attention to open and public community discussion on the issue.

2351
02:58:15,153 --> 02:58:30,887
[SPEAKER_12]: This was on the agenda, but I think a committee of the whole, for example, especially one that's tied closer to the budget, I think would be a more appropriate form for us to talk about the issue first before we approve it.

2352
02:58:32,589 --> 02:58:39,379
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think underscores the need for us to serve as a democratic forum for that.

2353
02:58:39,860 --> 02:58:44,526
[SPEAKER_12]: When we think about the 25 million certified and free cash that was confirmed today.

2354
02:58:47,250 --> 02:58:57,220
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Collins's sentiment that I think we need to be a little bit more critical when we think of whether it's a good or a bad thing.

2355
02:58:57,300 --> 02:58:58,181
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's nuanced.

2356
02:58:58,201 --> 02:59:06,489
[SPEAKER_12]: It's certainly good to have a lot of free cash, but we have to keep in mind that there is a cost

2357
02:59:06,929 --> 02:59:08,651
[SPEAKER_12]: to this as well.

2358
02:59:09,852 --> 02:59:13,094
[SPEAKER_12]: And we need to talk about the long term investments that we want to make as a city.

2359
02:59:13,655 --> 02:59:22,062
[SPEAKER_12]: We need to talk about the, I mean, tonight was, I think a prime example of the need to invest in things now before they become cost ineffective in the future.

2360
02:59:23,923 --> 02:59:25,844
[SPEAKER_12]: And that requires some big picture thinking.

2361
02:59:25,904 --> 02:59:31,048
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm not saying that we don't fund the stabilization fund and we don't invest this money into it.

2362
02:59:31,208 --> 02:59:37,653
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just saying we need a committee of the whole meeting and a comprehensive budget process to talk about this.

2363
02:59:39,614 --> 02:59:45,498
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't want us to be under the illusion that more money in free cash is always a good thing.

2364
02:59:45,578 --> 02:59:50,242
[SPEAKER_12]: When we look at what's recommended by DLS, we are above that, actually.

2365
02:59:50,282 --> 02:59:51,222
[SPEAKER_12]: We are above the upper limit.

2366
02:59:52,283 --> 03:00:03,394
[SPEAKER_12]: recommended by DLS and I find the finance director may have his own opinion which I think we should value and I would like to hear in that committee the whole meeting if that's the case.

2367
03:00:04,675 --> 03:00:10,281
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think we also need to look at the needs of the city and what residents are asking us for.

2368
03:00:10,962 --> 03:00:18,772
[SPEAKER_12]: and taking a more holistic approach to looking at how we do budget, how we do finances and how we approach the stabilization fund.

2369
03:00:18,912 --> 03:00:20,274
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, I'm not opposed to it.

2370
03:00:20,294 --> 03:00:23,439
[SPEAKER_12]: I think there's just questions about

2371
03:00:24,678 --> 03:00:41,915
[SPEAKER_12]: looking at the big picture of it all, how we fund it, and I, in doing research for this, I did see some towns said that they preferred not to put free cash in and they preferred to take the other funding mechanisms that Vice President Bears referred to.

2372
03:00:43,057 --> 03:00:49,144
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I think we need to also have a discussion about why we're choosing this approach rather than those other approaches.

2373
03:00:49,164 --> 03:00:57,876
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure there's a justification for it, but I think we need to have a longer meeting about it and a meeting that's more focused on this.

2374
03:00:58,928 --> 03:01:18,855
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Knight, Madam President, thank you very much and I think the administration putting this paper on this paper reflects a resolution that I had filed back in 2018 when I requested that the Burke administration create a stabilization fund, and I'm the basis behind that request at the time was that it was the best practice of municipal government is published by the Massachusetts, Massachusetts Municipal Association.

2375
03:01:19,515 --> 03:01:20,576
[SPEAKER_17]: as well as GAAP.

2376
03:01:21,136 --> 03:01:21,436
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

2377
03:01:21,496 --> 03:01:29,601
[SPEAKER_17]: But what they also said was that as part of this best practice is that you should put between five and 8% of your total operating expenses into the stabilization account.

2378
03:01:30,201 --> 03:01:32,862
[SPEAKER_17]: So right now we have a $200 million operating budget.

2379
03:01:33,523 --> 03:01:41,147
[SPEAKER_17]: So 5% to 8% of that would be anywhere between 10 to $16 million for us to make this a sustainable account for stabilization purposes.

2380
03:01:41,965 --> 03:01:54,048
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think this misses the mark a little bit here, Madam President, and I too also feel as though we need to have a meeting to talk about a little bit further in depth, because if we're going to go through the process of creating a stabilization account, we want to make sure that it's viable and that it meets the standards of best practices.

2381
03:01:55,169 --> 03:01:57,889
[SPEAKER_17]: Ultimately, this is a bank account, it's a savings account is all it is.

2382
03:01:58,410 --> 03:02:01,911
[SPEAKER_17]: And if you want to take money out of it, you're going to have to get a two thirds vote from the council to do it.

2383
03:02:02,471 --> 03:02:06,512
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think this is a good thing, quite frankly, because I think, you know, it only takes four votes to spend the money.

2384
03:02:08,320 --> 03:02:09,121
[SPEAKER_17]: to get it out of this account.

2385
03:02:09,141 --> 03:02:12,543
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's something that I think is beneficial to the taxpayer in this community.

2386
03:02:13,104 --> 03:02:18,247
[SPEAKER_17]: So with that being said, I thank the council for bringing up the motion to send this to a committee of the whole and I look forward to discussing the paper.

2387
03:02:18,287 --> 03:02:19,929
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm excited about seeing it finally come to the floor.

2388
03:02:20,529 --> 03:02:20,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

2389
03:02:21,570 --> 03:02:24,031
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have a motion from Vice President Bears.

2390
03:02:24,112 --> 03:02:25,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have something?

2391
03:02:25,272 --> 03:02:26,213
[SPEAKER_03]: Just information.

2392
03:02:27,134 --> 03:02:28,054
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Morell.

2393
03:02:28,114 --> 03:02:32,698
[SPEAKER_18]: Happy to join the city council in discussions at committee of the whole on this matter.

2394
03:02:33,528 --> 03:02:36,309
[SPEAKER_18]: I appreciate the opportunity to discuss it further.

2395
03:02:36,329 --> 03:02:39,870
[SPEAKER_18]: A couple points of information, because I just want to make sure that the council has it.

2396
03:02:40,610 --> 03:02:45,491
[SPEAKER_18]: DLS, the Division of Local Services, published a, they do a regular newsletter.

2397
03:02:45,511 --> 03:02:46,751
[SPEAKER_18]: It's called City in Town.

2398
03:02:47,452 --> 03:02:54,573
[SPEAKER_18]: City in Town, back in November, that specifically stated, and I am only including a section of this, so I will disclose that.

2399
03:02:54,613 --> 03:03:00,215
[SPEAKER_18]: But over the last two years, communities have followed conservative budgeting practices, delayed capital investment,

2400
03:03:00,595 --> 03:03:04,956
[SPEAKER_18]: and seen an influx of federal assistance which has resulted in historically high reserve funds.

2401
03:03:05,016 --> 03:03:10,398
[SPEAKER_18]: Just information for everyone to know that we're not unique, we're not necessarily alone.

2402
03:03:10,458 --> 03:03:12,518
[SPEAKER_18]: This is something that has occurred in other communities.

2403
03:03:13,078 --> 03:03:24,241
[SPEAKER_18]: And as far as Councilor Knight's comment about 10 to 16K and missing the mark, some communities actually begin stabilization funds and believe it or not, they deposit $1 into it.

2404
03:03:25,181 --> 03:03:27,902
[SPEAKER_18]: The concept being to simply

2405
03:03:28,598 --> 03:03:31,299
[SPEAKER_18]: that this is a goal we want to achieve, and you work towards it.

2406
03:03:31,379 --> 03:03:38,223
[SPEAKER_18]: So again, happy to join conversations in the future on this matter, and I appreciate the council's discussion and interest in this.

2407
03:03:38,323 --> 03:03:38,623
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2408
03:03:38,923 --> 03:03:39,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

2409
03:03:39,923 --> 03:03:41,564
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have a motion from Vice President Bears.

2410
03:03:41,584 --> 03:03:43,385
[SPEAKER_17]: That wasn't a motion to amend the paper to $1, was it?

2411
03:03:43,485 --> 03:03:45,406
[SPEAKER_17]: For the administration?

2412
03:03:45,606 --> 03:03:46,506
[SPEAKER_03]: She can't make motions.

2413
03:03:47,207 --> 03:03:50,128
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the mayor's paper, so I don't know if the mayor was amending the paper to $1.

2414
03:03:54,092 --> 03:03:55,213
[SPEAKER_17]: I misunderstood, I'm sorry.

2415
03:03:55,414 --> 03:03:56,915
[SPEAKER_18]: I misunderstood.

2416
03:03:56,935 --> 03:03:59,837
[SPEAKER_18]: Just to clarify, no, I was not speaking on behalf of the mayor.

2417
03:03:59,857 --> 03:04:02,580
[SPEAKER_18]: The mayor would simply have to make that herself.

2418
03:04:02,820 --> 03:04:03,140
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2419
03:04:04,381 --> 03:04:08,465
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a motion from Vice President Bears, seconded by Councilor Carr-Gallo to move this to Committee of the Whole.

2420
03:04:08,485 --> 03:04:09,346
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

2421
03:04:09,366 --> 03:04:09,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

2422
03:04:10,427 --> 03:04:11,127
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

2423
03:04:11,167 --> 03:04:11,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

2424
03:04:11,888 --> 03:04:11,908
[SPEAKER_03]: 23-072.

2425
03:04:18,863 --> 03:04:22,145
[SPEAKER_03]: to honorable President and members of Medford City Council regarding contract ordinance.

2426
03:04:22,225 --> 03:04:38,937
[SPEAKER_03]: Dear President Morell and members of the City Council, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body, pursuant to provisions of MGL Chapter 30B, Section 12, approve and authorize the city of Medford to enter into a 10-year agreement for a citywide collection, disposal, and processing of solid waste, reusables, and recyclables.

2427
03:04:39,457 --> 03:04:41,779
[SPEAKER_03]: The following department heads will be available to answer any questions.

2428
03:04:41,819 --> 03:04:46,622
[SPEAKER_03]: DPW Commissioner Tim McGivern and Planning, Development, and Sustainable Director Alicia Hunt, respectfully submitted.

2429
03:04:46,662 --> 03:04:48,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Breanna Lungo-Koehn mayor.

2430
03:04:49,154 --> 03:04:53,638
[SPEAKER_03]: I see we have Director Hunt on Zoom and Commissioner McGuire remains with us this evening.

2431
03:04:53,658 --> 03:04:58,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to tell us kind of what this is, why this is before us?

2432
03:04:59,523 --> 03:04:59,783
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure.

2433
03:05:00,203 --> 03:05:04,947
[SPEAKER_16]: So we presented on the RFP for the new trash contract.

2434
03:05:05,824 --> 03:05:14,087
[SPEAKER_16]: And we had talked about how the intention was to have a contract longer than three years, and that we would need to come back.

2435
03:05:14,547 --> 03:05:29,411
[SPEAKER_16]: We did decide between then and now that it made much more sense from a strategic standpoint releasing the RFP that if the responders know that that was approved ahead of time, it will put the city in a better position when they're

2436
03:05:29,876 --> 03:05:34,938
[SPEAKER_16]: preparing their responses, and we believe it's better to do it that way.

2437
03:05:35,779 --> 03:05:41,922
[SPEAKER_16]: Otherwise, if it's a question mark for them, then we may not get the best responses.

2438
03:05:42,062 --> 03:05:45,183
[SPEAKER_16]: So the idea is to try to get ahead of that.

2439
03:05:45,583 --> 03:05:49,906
[SPEAKER_16]: Otherwise, we would have brought it to you before, but it was kind of a decision between now and then.

2440
03:05:50,026 --> 03:05:51,606
[SPEAKER_16]: So hopefully that makes sense.

2441
03:05:51,766 --> 03:05:57,949
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm more than happy to answer more questions, but the idea is a longer term contract is going to

2442
03:06:00,365 --> 03:06:09,929
[SPEAKER_16]: help with the expenses on the contract for various things, for example, truck amortization, when they're taking new trucks that they purchase and putting them over the life of the contract.

2443
03:06:10,689 --> 03:06:21,713
[SPEAKER_16]: So to give the responders more confidence in items like that, and to get better information for the city to negotiate the contract, I think is the right thing.

2444
03:06:21,813 --> 03:06:23,314
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you for entertaining this.

2445
03:06:24,768 --> 03:06:30,872
[SPEAKER_17]: Madam President, I believe we're coming off, maybe a second or third 10 year contracts with our rubbish hauler right now.

2446
03:06:32,252 --> 03:06:41,858
[SPEAKER_17]: And I just like to request a copy of the legal opinion from the city solicitor that says that we're required to take this vote, because I believe we've taken this vote previous previous Council's taken this vote that votes dance.

2447
03:06:42,945 --> 03:07:05,637
[SPEAKER_17]: So the city solicitor could provide us with a legal opinion and as we stated the city solicitor is required to approve all these contracts to form the city is also required to approve all legal instruments in this matter before us here is a legal instrument so I'm hoping the city solicitor can give us an opinion as to whether or not they feel as well this council has to take this vote or whether or not the previous vote the previous councils have taken still stands, because this is going to come up on other matters.

2448
03:07:06,300 --> 03:07:18,969
[SPEAKER_17]: We have a trash contract we have a cable contract for example, which is another one that comes up in the council in the past has given the authority to the mayor to enter into these 10 year contracts it was one vote that was both stood in perpetuity until the council rescinded that authority.

2449
03:07:19,930 --> 03:07:29,657
[SPEAKER_17]: So I just asked if we could get that legal opinion as to whether or not the council spinning his wheels there and doing something that's already done, whether or not our city solicitor is provided can provide us with a legal opinion

2450
03:07:30,650 --> 03:07:33,451
[SPEAKER_03]: and understanding we have no city solicitor, would you accept a legal opinion?

2451
03:07:33,471 --> 03:07:37,412
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, I think that there is a standing legal opinion from a prior city solicitor.

2452
03:07:37,712 --> 03:07:44,715
[SPEAKER_17]: And we have a public records retention law, so I'm pretty sure that that opinion would stand because that was the solicitor and we don't have one now.

2453
03:07:45,035 --> 03:07:45,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

2454
03:07:47,656 --> 03:07:50,036
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a form of motion.

2455
03:07:51,437 --> 03:07:52,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Second by Councilor Cabrera.

2456
03:07:52,317 --> 03:07:54,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Any further discussion?

2457
03:07:54,578 --> 03:07:58,199
[SPEAKER_03]: I do see Director Hunt, your hand up, Director Hunt.

2458
03:08:01,832 --> 03:08:03,392
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Madam President.

2459
03:08:03,533 --> 03:08:10,095
[SPEAKER_11]: We are working with the legal counsel from KP Law that signs all of our contracts on this.

2460
03:08:10,435 --> 03:08:29,661
[SPEAKER_11]: It is my understanding that when a counsel gives permission to sign a contract, they're giving, if we received permission from a previous counsel more than 15 years ago to sign a 10-year contract, that would not count for a new 10-year contract being signed what's approximately 14 years later.

2461
03:08:31,491 --> 03:08:36,858
[SPEAKER_11]: which is why our legal counsel has advised us that we need new permission.

2462
03:08:36,979 --> 03:08:41,825
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a different contract, a different counsel, it's different staff, it's a different RFP.

2463
03:08:41,925 --> 03:08:47,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Director Hunt.

2464
03:08:48,174 --> 03:08:48,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Collins.

2465
03:08:50,564 --> 03:08:51,405
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, President Merlin.

2466
03:08:51,425 --> 03:08:54,627
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wanted to thank Commissioner McKibben and Director Hunt for speaking on this issue.

2467
03:08:54,667 --> 03:09:10,298
[SPEAKER_14]: Obviously, I've heard about this issue more than my fellow councilors as a member of the Solid Waste Task Force, and we discussed in the context of that body, you know, how it's one of the things that makes this very, very expensive budget line item, the waste hauling contract,

2468
03:09:10,733 --> 03:09:24,963
[SPEAKER_14]: feasible both for perspective haulers and for the city are these long contracts for some of the reasons that Commissioner given just spoke to, I think if, based on the question from Councilor Knight and what Director Hunt has heard from the legal counsel that we do have available to us.

2469
03:09:26,207 --> 03:09:34,254
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I know that we're in previous meetings, we've discussed the RFP timeline for getting this out to haulers to getting those responses back.

2470
03:09:35,675 --> 03:09:39,558
[SPEAKER_14]: If, you know, I wanna make sure that we get a satisfying opinion on that question.

2471
03:09:39,598 --> 03:09:53,510
[SPEAKER_14]: I also wanna make sure that this timeline is proceeding the way that the experts say that it needs to, so that we can be proceeding along and getting these competitive bids and keeping things on schedule again, all towards the goal of getting

2472
03:09:53,936 --> 03:09:58,497
[SPEAKER_14]: the best bids that we can on this really, really outsized piece of our DPW budget.

2473
03:09:58,537 --> 03:10:03,499
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'd be happy to motion for approval tonight based on that context from Director Hunt.

2474
03:10:03,519 --> 03:10:04,319
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2475
03:10:04,339 --> 03:10:06,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we have a motion on the floor from Councilor Knight.

2476
03:10:07,940 --> 03:10:10,521
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can see how that goes.

2477
03:10:10,541 --> 03:10:13,602
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have the motion from Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

2478
03:10:13,742 --> 03:10:16,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Would that be to a date certain, waiting for that legal opinion?

2479
03:10:16,643 --> 03:10:22,285
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think we can put a date certain.

2480
03:10:34,027 --> 03:10:37,770
[SPEAKER_17]: a date on it, one of the people in the text club puts a date on it, it'll, it'll happen.

2481
03:10:37,830 --> 03:10:38,590
[SPEAKER_17]: But you know what I mean?

2482
03:10:38,630 --> 03:10:40,392
[SPEAKER_17]: I know if I do it, I'm not going to get a date, sir.

2483
03:10:40,452 --> 03:10:42,253
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not going to get any information from this administration.

2484
03:10:42,273 --> 03:10:46,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so we have a motion from Councilor Knight.

2485
03:10:49,518 --> 03:10:51,579
[SPEAKER_03]: Second by Vice President Bears.

2486
03:10:53,201 --> 03:10:57,884
[SPEAKER_13]: Just on this question, I mean, so if it's stable, if we did this next week, instead of this week, is it going to delay you getting the RFP out?

2487
03:10:59,412 --> 03:11:00,793
[SPEAKER_16]: The timeline is set.

2488
03:11:01,014 --> 03:11:07,979
[SPEAKER_16]: So, as we discussed last time that that ball is rolling so I don't date.

2489
03:11:10,281 --> 03:11:12,663
[SPEAKER_16]: We'd like to, you know, we'd like to get it out this week.

2490
03:11:13,463 --> 03:11:14,484
[SPEAKER_16]: I think if you know.

2491
03:11:17,577 --> 03:11:20,360
[SPEAKER_16]: We thought it would, from a strategy standpoint, it made sense.

2492
03:11:21,482 --> 03:11:25,406
[SPEAKER_16]: If we don't have it, I just think we're in just slightly less of a better position.

2493
03:11:25,706 --> 03:11:36,058
[SPEAKER_16]: Like I was saying, if we have that vote, then the responders know that we have that vote, as opposed to it's coming later when we sign the contract.

2494
03:11:36,098 --> 03:11:37,820
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're just trying to make sure we're not.

2495
03:11:58,774 --> 03:12:00,494
[SPEAKER_16]: Back to any previous folks, I don't think.

2496
03:12:00,514 --> 03:12:01,075
[SPEAKER_17]: Set a precedent.

2497
03:12:01,935 --> 03:12:02,875
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway.

2498
03:12:02,915 --> 03:12:05,276
[SPEAKER_17]: So every other paper that ever came would set a precedent now.

2499
03:12:05,316 --> 03:12:09,297
[SPEAKER_17]: So every other authority that we ever gave for contracts longer than three years, they'll have to come back to us.

2500
03:12:09,477 --> 03:12:10,257
[SPEAKER_17]: So it'll set a precedent.

2501
03:12:11,197 --> 03:12:11,577
[SPEAKER_17]: Interesting.

2502
03:12:11,837 --> 03:12:11,997
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

2503
03:12:12,317 --> 03:12:13,758
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's the cable contract.

2504
03:12:13,878 --> 03:12:15,298
[SPEAKER_17]: That was the parking contract.

2505
03:12:15,738 --> 03:12:16,498
[SPEAKER_17]: That was, you know what I mean?

2506
03:12:16,518 --> 03:12:17,518
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the trash contract.

2507
03:12:18,179 --> 03:12:19,419
[SPEAKER_17]: So it has an effect.

2508
03:12:21,220 --> 03:12:26,765
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to interrupt you Tim but this is where the frustration comes in.

2509
03:12:27,406 --> 03:12:31,449
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like something this big right 10 year contract one of the biggest contracts we have in the community.

2510
03:12:32,470 --> 03:12:33,931
[SPEAKER_06]: Now again, we're told that.

2511
03:12:36,344 --> 03:12:40,406
[SPEAKER_06]: ideally getting the vote done right now and not truly understanding it.

2512
03:12:40,486 --> 03:12:43,027
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a part that I feel very uncomfortable with.

2513
03:12:43,467 --> 03:12:51,951
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's why we talked originally tonight about the lack of communication and understanding of respect with this council, because that's how we feel.

2514
03:12:51,991 --> 03:12:56,573
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's probably not intended, but it's how we feel.

2515
03:12:57,230 --> 03:12:58,150
[SPEAKER_16]: Do the chair respond to that?

2516
03:12:58,611 --> 03:13:14,456
[SPEAKER_16]: This actually wouldn't necessarily hold up the process because the original plan would still hold that, you know, like we described in prior presentations, that when a winner is selected, we still have to come to you for this vote.

2517
03:13:14,856 --> 03:13:27,018
[SPEAKER_16]: The idea here was that within the last couple weeks, talking with our consultants, we say, you know what, the city would be in a better position from a response to RFP if we had this ahead of time.

2518
03:13:27,678 --> 03:13:33,359
[SPEAKER_16]: That's really what it came down to, which is why we decided to try to get ahead of that tonight.

2519
03:13:33,599 --> 03:13:38,720
[SPEAKER_16]: But regardless, we have to have this approval from this body, from our understanding.

2520
03:13:39,400 --> 03:13:41,681
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's really where it stands.

2521
03:13:42,401 --> 03:13:42,501
[SPEAKER_16]: So.

2522
03:13:44,395 --> 03:13:58,481
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Madam President, being the only member of this council right now that was here when we voted on the last 10 year contract that got, I don't think counseling that you're on the, on the parking, whether it was the same, it was the same thing.

2523
03:13:58,501 --> 03:14:00,442
[SPEAKER_09]: We got to do it tonight you got to get it done.

2524
03:14:01,442 --> 03:14:08,225
[SPEAKER_09]: I made a bad decision back then, and our current mayor was on that same council, and I think she'll agree that we made a bad decision back then.

2525
03:14:09,065 --> 03:14:14,287
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't see what the harm in getting a legal opinion to make sure that we're doing it right.

2526
03:14:14,307 --> 03:14:22,571
[SPEAKER_09]: A 10-year contract is a big commitment, and like I said, I've done it before on a Russian

2527
03:14:24,470 --> 03:14:29,713
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was the same thing that no, nothing, no distributor, Tim, I think they should get a 10 year contract.

2528
03:14:30,094 --> 03:14:32,855
[SPEAKER_09]: Just think we should get make sure that we're doing it the right way.

2529
03:14:32,915 --> 03:14:34,376
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I said I did it before.

2530
03:14:35,477 --> 03:14:36,277
[SPEAKER_09]: And I got burnt on it.

2531
03:14:39,119 --> 03:14:45,142
[SPEAKER_11]: Madam President, Madam President, may I address Councilor Scarpelli points please?

2532
03:14:47,224 --> 03:14:47,444
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

2533
03:14:49,373 --> 03:14:50,254
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm the chair.

2534
03:14:50,894 --> 03:14:55,457
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just want to be clear that this is not the first time we brought this up.

2535
03:14:55,837 --> 03:14:58,259
[SPEAKER_11]: Kim and I were in front of the city council in September.

2536
03:14:58,659 --> 03:15:06,464
[SPEAKER_11]: We presented about this process and we stated quite clearly that we would be coming back to the council asking for a vote to approve a 10 year contract.

2537
03:15:06,985 --> 03:15:14,390
[SPEAKER_11]: We were in front of the council again in February where we presented about the RFP before we, as we were getting ready to release it.

2538
03:15:14,810 --> 03:15:18,012
[SPEAKER_11]: And we stated again, that would be in front of the council for a 10 year vote.

2539
03:15:18,789 --> 03:15:28,795
[SPEAKER_11]: And tonight actually is the first time I've ever heard anybody suggest that we might not need the council to vote to approve a 10 year contract.

2540
03:15:29,135 --> 03:15:31,896
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the very first that we've heard of this idea.

2541
03:15:33,417 --> 03:15:37,320
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli.

2542
03:15:37,520 --> 03:15:45,024
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to respond to that, then you weren't clear enough for this council to understand the process.

2543
03:15:46,353 --> 03:15:48,714
[SPEAKER_06]: So because I think there are councils here that are very confused.

2544
03:15:49,455 --> 03:15:51,957
[SPEAKER_06]: If this was presented to us, Ms.

2545
03:15:52,017 --> 03:15:56,499
[SPEAKER_06]: Hunt, then we wouldn't be talking about these other legalities.

2546
03:15:57,780 --> 03:16:00,942
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe there was a flaw in your presentation.

2547
03:16:03,003 --> 03:16:13,030
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's where I find it being disingenuine when you've been in front of this council multiple times, obviously.

2548
03:16:13,998 --> 03:16:19,062
[SPEAKER_06]: But when we have questions like this, obviously it wasn't clear enough.

2549
03:16:19,823 --> 03:16:20,163
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

2550
03:16:20,263 --> 03:16:20,943
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

2551
03:16:21,023 --> 03:16:26,067
[SPEAKER_11]: And I see that Councilor Knight has left, but he's the only one who has ever suggested.

2552
03:16:26,528 --> 03:16:35,555
[SPEAKER_11]: Our legal counsel hasn't, our consultants haven't, and he didn't bring it up at any of the previous presentations that we made over the past six months.

2553
03:16:35,575 --> 03:16:37,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

2554
03:16:37,856 --> 03:16:38,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Collins.

2555
03:16:39,169 --> 03:16:40,129
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, President Morell.

2556
03:16:40,449 --> 03:16:42,710
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate the discussion around this.

2557
03:16:42,750 --> 03:16:47,772
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate the context from some of our department heads that have been working on this.

2558
03:16:48,192 --> 03:16:49,773
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that there's disagreement on this point.

2559
03:16:50,193 --> 03:16:54,554
[SPEAKER_14]: I am swayed by Commissioner McGibbon's point that I don't see why.

2560
03:16:54,914 --> 03:16:56,775
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, this isn't a vote on a contract.

2561
03:16:56,795 --> 03:17:02,697
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just a vote to enable these departments to pursue a contract longer than three years.

2562
03:17:02,737 --> 03:17:05,058
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're not marrying ourselves to any

2563
03:17:06,476 --> 03:17:13,578
[SPEAKER_14]: contractor company, I would motion for approval with a roll call vote to try and move this forward, and maybe we can concurrently get a legal opinion.

2564
03:17:13,778 --> 03:17:14,618
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2565
03:17:14,979 --> 03:17:17,579
[SPEAKER_03]: There is an existing motion on the floor, though, a second motion on the floor.

2566
03:17:17,619 --> 03:17:18,440
[SPEAKER_14]: That's right, thank you.

2567
03:17:19,160 --> 03:17:19,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Tseng.

2568
03:17:23,261 --> 03:17:26,742
[SPEAKER_13]: I just have one question that I'm confused about here, and Tim maybe could answer it.

2569
03:17:26,782 --> 03:17:29,043
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, Tim, to call you away from that.

2570
03:17:31,023 --> 03:17:33,144
[SPEAKER_13]: And my vote's basically gonna hinge on the answer to this question.

2571
03:17:34,825 --> 03:17:35,805
[SPEAKER_13]: If we vote for this now,

2572
03:17:36,311 --> 03:17:41,735
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, then you don't have to come back to us when you've selected a contract to approve that contract.

2573
03:17:41,815 --> 03:17:42,756
[SPEAKER_13]: That that would be correct.

2574
03:17:42,816 --> 03:17:43,997
[SPEAKER_13]: We would be able.

2575
03:17:45,298 --> 03:17:45,818
[SPEAKER_13]: That's okay.

2576
03:17:45,858 --> 03:17:50,161
[SPEAKER_13]: So like, I'm fine authorizing that this that we are cool with a 10 year contract.

2577
03:17:50,361 --> 03:17:53,344
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I'm not fine authorizing that before the bidding process.

2578
03:17:53,564 --> 03:17:55,545
[SPEAKER_13]: I understand it might put the city in a better position.

2579
03:17:55,585 --> 03:17:57,627
[SPEAKER_13]: But that was just a clarification piece that I wanted.

2580
03:17:57,887 --> 03:18:01,930
[SPEAKER_13]: This basically would just mean we don't get you don't come back to us again after this, right?

2581
03:18:03,533 --> 03:18:05,555
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think it means that definitively.

2582
03:18:05,635 --> 03:18:10,779
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I think it means, you know, like I said, there's a legal requirement for you to come back to us again.

2583
03:18:11,240 --> 03:18:19,727
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I believe if I understand the process correctly, it would be a vote to authorize the mayor to execute an agreement longer than three years.

2584
03:18:20,067 --> 03:18:20,327
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

2585
03:18:20,347 --> 03:18:25,632
[SPEAKER_16]: So once we receive a response to the RFP, then we go through the whole process of reviewing it.

2586
03:18:26,012 --> 03:18:27,273
[SPEAKER_16]: And once we select the winner,

2587
03:18:27,692 --> 03:18:29,674
[SPEAKER_16]: then we enter into contract negotiations.

2588
03:18:30,775 --> 03:18:35,698
[SPEAKER_16]: And when we are, when we, yes, we would have to negotiate that contract.

2589
03:18:36,379 --> 03:18:42,624
[SPEAKER_16]: And then this vote would allow the mayor to authorize that contract, or execute that contract, from what I understand.

2590
03:18:42,644 --> 03:18:44,045
[SPEAKER_16]: So, you know,

2591
03:18:45,613 --> 03:18:56,499
[SPEAKER_16]: The root of this, though, is really the question that came up in our review with our consultants, how to best position the city for the response to the RFP.

2592
03:18:57,079 --> 03:19:08,225
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's why we think, because right now, you know, in the RFP, it's basically the draft RFP, is that this vote is coming as opposed to has been made.

2593
03:19:08,985 --> 03:19:13,828
[SPEAKER_16]: So in a hypothetical example where this body voted that down,

2594
03:19:14,508 --> 03:19:19,129
[SPEAKER_16]: then obviously the confidence level wouldn't be there for the contract.

2595
03:19:19,149 --> 03:19:19,389
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure.

2596
03:19:19,709 --> 03:19:20,649
[SPEAKER_16]: You see what I'm saying?

2597
03:19:20,729 --> 03:19:28,571
[SPEAKER_16]: So regardless of what happens tonight, the schedule stays the same, if that makes sense.

2598
03:19:28,631 --> 03:19:31,071
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're not changing our schedule because we really can't at this point.

2599
03:19:31,131 --> 03:19:31,711
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

2600
03:19:32,011 --> 03:19:33,472
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're not planning on changing that.

2601
03:19:33,732 --> 03:19:41,113
[SPEAKER_16]: But if the council decided not to approve this tonight, then we would, yes, we would have to come back at some point down the line

2602
03:19:41,878 --> 03:19:43,399
[SPEAKER_16]: to receive that authorization.

2603
03:19:43,539 --> 03:19:52,723
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is where, and again, I really don't wanna belabor this and I'm hoping we can wrap this up soon, but for me, like when we were just, when the process was described to us, I think this is where there's maybe a little bit of a switch up.

2604
03:19:53,184 --> 03:20:01,888
[SPEAKER_13]: I hear you, you're saying you've come back at this point, you've had a further conversation, you think the quality of bids will be higher if the bidders know that they're gonna get a 10-year contract.

2605
03:20:01,988 --> 03:20:02,168
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

2606
03:20:02,808 --> 03:20:06,170
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, I for one will 100% vote for a 10-year contract.

2607
03:20:08,331 --> 03:20:10,372
[SPEAKER_13]: That makes a lot of sense, I'm totally in favor of that.

2608
03:20:11,192 --> 03:20:18,775
[SPEAKER_13]: just think where there's a switch is, is a little bit here and I'm hearing you come come with it is an adjustment to the process that we had discussed before, right?

2609
03:20:18,795 --> 03:20:19,415
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure, yes.

2610
03:20:20,655 --> 03:20:21,896
[SPEAKER_13]: And I want to entertain that openly.

2611
03:20:21,916 --> 03:20:25,277
[SPEAKER_13]: This to me, and I'm happy to hear a rebuttal.

2612
03:20:25,637 --> 03:20:31,419
[SPEAKER_13]: This to me says if we vote yes on this, then we are authorizing whatever 10 year contract the mayor decides is best.

2613
03:20:32,135 --> 03:20:40,679
[SPEAKER_13]: versus if we went with the process that we had talked about previously, it would be, we would be voting to authorize a 10-year contract where we have the specifics after the bidding process.

2614
03:20:41,200 --> 03:20:44,041
[SPEAKER_13]: And that just to me is a real difference substantively.

2615
03:20:44,061 --> 03:21:00,610
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, if you think, if I heard from you and Alicia that the quality of the bids will be so much lower if we don't approve it now versus approve it later, like I'm willing to entertain that discussion, but it just really is a change from we will approve this 10-year contract to we will approve whatever 10-year contract gets

2616
03:21:01,091 --> 03:21:02,394
[SPEAKER_13]: come up with through the process.

2617
03:21:02,935 --> 03:21:05,681
[SPEAKER_13]: And that just seems, it's a different question to me.

2618
03:21:06,463 --> 03:21:10,272
[SPEAKER_13]: And so that's just, you know, and I think part of it is like, you know,

2619
03:21:13,225 --> 03:21:16,047
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, we've had a lot of discussions about trust and communication tonight, right?

2620
03:21:16,067 --> 03:21:22,811
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, I trust you and Alicia are doing a really good job on this RFP process, but you and Alicia don't make the final decision on the contract.

2621
03:21:22,931 --> 03:21:26,713
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, and then there's a different level of trust there right now.

2622
03:21:27,033 --> 03:21:32,436
[SPEAKER_13]: Although, you know, in any case, I won't get back into that discussion, but that's just a difference to me.

2623
03:21:32,456 --> 03:21:38,780
[SPEAKER_13]: And I didn't really fully understand, like, I would be happy to vote tonight to say, I 100% support the city entering into a 10 year contract.

2624
03:21:39,203 --> 03:21:45,467
[SPEAKER_13]: But I don't want to vote to say you don't have to come back to us once you've negotiated a contract and then get us to approve it and it sounds like this is both of those things.

2625
03:21:46,188 --> 03:21:47,588
[SPEAKER_13]: And it doesn't can't really be split up.

2626
03:21:47,829 --> 03:21:48,809
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's just where I'm coming from.

2627
03:21:52,992 --> 03:22:05,920
[SPEAKER_09]: Council business one of us right, I know I will support a 10 year contract when when it comes back but like I said, I got burnt on this before, and I got to be as right, you know, I want you to come back to us.

2628
03:22:07,455 --> 03:22:12,398
[SPEAKER_09]: But you, but let's say, I will, I will support 10 year contract, but I want to know what I'm supporting.

2629
03:22:13,659 --> 03:22:22,986
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, the issue that's really before us here and the only thing that we as a body can do is authorize the mayor to enter into a contract that's in excess of 36 months or not.

2630
03:22:23,526 --> 03:22:26,928
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, if we authorize her that power we authorize that power if we don't, we don't.

2631
03:22:27,589 --> 03:22:28,990
[SPEAKER_17]: Ultimately, if we give her the 10 years.

2632
03:22:31,103 --> 03:22:36,006
[SPEAKER_17]: or whatever term that we deem appropriate, the mayor is still the chief negotiator in this community.

2633
03:22:36,406 --> 03:22:43,510
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's not like we can say, oh, we don't like this, and we don't like that, and we don't like this, take that out of the contract, and we're gonna give you the 10 years, right?

2634
03:22:43,570 --> 03:22:46,952
[SPEAKER_17]: It's either, she's the one that negotiates the contract, she's the chief negotiator, right?

2635
03:22:46,992 --> 03:22:49,794
[SPEAKER_17]: So when this happened with the parking contract, it turned into a nightmare.

2636
03:22:50,034 --> 03:22:56,618
[SPEAKER_17]: And the reason it turned into a nightmare was because we're not gonna give you the approval to enter into the contract, unless you take this out, unless you put this in, unless you do this, unless you do that.

2637
03:22:56,978 --> 03:22:59,919
[SPEAKER_17]: We took over the role of the chief negotiator, and it turned into a disaster, all right?

2638
03:22:59,939 --> 03:23:00,820
[SPEAKER_17]: It was an absolute disaster.

2639
03:23:01,220 --> 03:23:06,522
[SPEAKER_17]: So ultimately, the only issue that's before us is whether or not we want to allow the mayor to enter with a contract that exceeds the term of 36 months, right?

2640
03:23:07,122 --> 03:23:08,622
[SPEAKER_17]: At this point in time, I'm not comfortable with that.

2641
03:23:09,242 --> 03:23:13,183
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think that's really the issue, that's the only issue that's before us right now.

2642
03:23:13,223 --> 03:23:21,326
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not comfortable taking that vote because I don't know legally what the ramifications are, but I'm very concerned about what could happen when we give her that authority.

2643
03:23:21,726 --> 03:23:28,928
[SPEAKER_17]: What happens if we give the authority to enter into a 10-year contract and now next thing you know, we're paying a trash fee?

2644
03:23:30,669 --> 03:23:31,810
[SPEAKER_17]: Right now we have free trash pickup.

2645
03:23:31,850 --> 03:23:32,951
[SPEAKER_17]: Other communities have a trash fee.

2646
03:23:34,753 --> 03:23:36,334
[SPEAKER_17]: And we just gave her the authority to do that for 10 years.

2647
03:23:36,594 --> 03:23:38,015
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe the term's not going to be so favorable.

2648
03:23:38,035 --> 03:23:39,156
[SPEAKER_17]: So those are the things we got to think about.

2649
03:23:39,557 --> 03:23:43,020
[SPEAKER_17]: And right now in this stage in the game, I'm not too keen on thinking about them.

2650
03:23:43,060 --> 03:23:45,682
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that the administration should put out the RFPs and let's see what comes back.

2651
03:23:46,302 --> 03:23:49,925
[SPEAKER_17]: Because most likely what's going to come back is an RFP that's going to say, we want 10 years.

2652
03:23:49,965 --> 03:23:50,566
[SPEAKER_17]: Can you get the vote?

2653
03:23:53,909 --> 03:23:54,369
[SPEAKER_16]: President Moreau.

2654
03:23:55,150 --> 03:23:55,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Commissioner Gabor.

2655
03:23:58,108 --> 03:24:06,650
[SPEAKER_16]: An option may be to also require a return with the contract to this body in the vote.

2656
03:24:07,290 --> 03:24:11,711
[SPEAKER_16]: So you could condition it to say that you have to come back at a later date.

2657
03:24:11,751 --> 03:24:16,592
[SPEAKER_17]: There is nobody in this building that can give us, hello, any legal opinion in this building.

2658
03:24:16,912 --> 03:24:21,553
[SPEAKER_17]: Nobody in this building can give us a legal opinion as to whether or not we can even do that.

2659
03:24:22,351 --> 03:24:27,017
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I'm just trying to put on the table, just trying to think of creative ways, because I want to try to give confidence to the bidders.

2660
03:24:27,457 --> 03:24:37,870
[SPEAKER_16]: Another way, you know, that some sort of motion of confidence or something to get to the bidders to say that

2661
03:24:38,419 --> 03:25:02,875
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, city council is confident that a 10 year agreement could be approved or an alternate, like I brought up approving it with the condition that we return prior to contract negotiations or something like that to review the, you know, to review what was returned for proposals and what our strategy might be for negotiation or something like that.

2662
03:25:03,576 --> 03:25:06,638
[SPEAKER_16]: So there might be some other options here that the council may wanna consider.

2663
03:25:09,415 --> 03:25:12,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

2664
03:25:13,200 --> 03:25:18,767
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks, I was, I just wanted to put on the record that when I see my time I was actually going to ask the same question.

2665
03:25:19,347 --> 03:25:21,510
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm also, it's fun.

2666
03:25:22,571 --> 03:25:23,312
[SPEAKER_12]: It happens all the time.

2667
03:25:28,871 --> 03:25:36,761
[SPEAKER_12]: something along the lines of what you said, we're open to the option of 10 years, you know, we, I would be happy to vote for that.

2668
03:25:36,961 --> 03:25:41,146
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just that I don't want to give up our oversight power automatically.

2669
03:25:41,186 --> 03:25:45,451
[SPEAKER_06]: Point of information with that, you know, daily municipal RFPs myself.

2670
03:25:46,252 --> 03:25:53,616
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's a slippery slope when we start putting in language that is really specific when you talk about procurement and RFPs.

2671
03:25:54,137 --> 03:26:11,766
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, I think this is again where it comes in not having legal opinion because this could be, ultimately we can go through this whole process and then come back and say the process was skewed and then we have lawsuits from competing vendors.

2672
03:26:12,567 --> 03:26:12,867
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't,

2673
03:26:16,280 --> 03:26:21,284
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, it's just not having that communication and understanding, so.

2674
03:26:21,944 --> 03:26:23,886
[SPEAKER_03]: I know folks are suggesting other motions.

2675
03:26:23,926 --> 03:26:25,287
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have a motion on the floor.

2676
03:26:25,607 --> 03:26:30,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a second to get a legal opinion on the vote.

2677
03:26:40,074 --> 03:26:55,859
[SPEAKER_13]: Would you be open to amending that to make it as a motion to table for one week to request the opinion from the law department and also to give the administration and the DPW director and the PDS director a chance to propose potentially an alternative as long as there's... Why don't we just table it and they can do whatever the hell they want.

2678
03:26:55,879 --> 03:26:58,640
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't need to make it this big, long-drawn-out thing.

2679
03:26:58,660 --> 03:26:59,160
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll table it.

2680
03:26:59,240 --> 03:27:00,680
[SPEAKER_17]: Someone takes a motion, take it off the table.

2681
03:27:00,700 --> 03:27:01,421
[SPEAKER_17]: It comes off the table.

2682
03:27:01,441 --> 03:27:02,701
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't need to turn it into this big thing.

2683
03:27:02,721 --> 03:27:04,822
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, if they get us a legal opinion, they get us a legal opinion.

2684
03:27:05,222 --> 03:27:06,742
[SPEAKER_17]: Not sure we're gonna get it, but... You know what I mean?

2685
03:27:07,182 --> 03:27:08,083
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I would...

2686
03:27:09,732 --> 03:27:10,913
[SPEAKER_03]: I already have the second.

2687
03:27:11,153 --> 03:27:13,454
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, okay, fine.

2688
03:27:13,594 --> 03:27:22,358
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have a motion from Councilor Knight to get a legal opinion on the request before us based on previous legal opinion, seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

2689
03:27:23,678 --> 03:27:24,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Any further discussion?

2690
03:27:25,119 --> 03:27:26,399
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry, is that a motion to table?

2691
03:27:26,419 --> 03:27:31,182
[SPEAKER_03]: A motion to table an order as we wait for that legal opinion.

2692
03:27:33,903 --> 03:27:34,603
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you want to take it?

2693
03:27:34,803 --> 03:27:36,784
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, I mean, what is the other option?

2694
03:27:37,024 --> 03:27:37,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no.

2695
03:27:38,125 --> 03:27:38,785
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I know, yeah.

2696
03:27:39,525 --> 03:27:41,046
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanna make sure I know what we're doing.

2697
03:27:42,027 --> 03:27:44,568
[SPEAKER_03]: So on the motion of Councilor Knights, seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

2698
03:27:44,588 --> 03:27:47,430
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not getting a legal opinion right now, so.

2699
03:27:47,450 --> 03:27:51,092
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a table until we get a legal opinion.

2700
03:27:51,112 --> 03:27:51,673
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

2701
03:27:51,973 --> 03:27:52,353
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2702
03:27:52,393 --> 03:27:53,074
[SPEAKER_08]: It's your motion.

2703
03:28:09,893 --> 03:28:10,573
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not nice.

2704
03:28:11,773 --> 03:28:13,054
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not cute when you trash it.

2705
03:28:13,714 --> 03:28:15,714
[SPEAKER_18]: May I request just a legal opinion?

2706
03:28:15,854 --> 03:28:18,295
[SPEAKER_18]: Just restate it so I understand exactly what the request is.

2707
03:28:18,735 --> 03:28:20,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the request, do you want to say?

2708
03:28:20,115 --> 03:28:23,316
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to read it back, Mr. Clerk?

2709
03:28:23,376 --> 03:28:24,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want me to?

2710
03:28:24,936 --> 03:28:26,976
[SPEAKER_08]: What I have is a request.

2711
03:28:27,036 --> 03:28:32,817
[SPEAKER_08]: I request a legal opinion from the city solicitor on whether the vote is necessary.

2712
03:28:33,097 --> 03:28:33,998
[SPEAKER_08]: We already took it.

2713
03:28:34,038 --> 03:28:35,378
[SPEAKER_08]: Council already took it previously.

2714
03:28:36,162 --> 03:28:37,123
[SPEAKER_08]: Understanding according.

2715
03:28:44,107 --> 03:28:45,148
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, we'll look at.

2716
03:28:45,168 --> 03:28:45,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2717
03:28:46,028 --> 03:28:46,909
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, exactly.

2718
03:28:47,189 --> 03:28:50,932
[SPEAKER_03]: per Councilor Knights memory that this is something that's already been a question that's come through.

2719
03:28:50,992 --> 03:28:54,914
[SPEAKER_18]: So maybe it legally should exist somewhere stating the obvious, it wouldn't be the city solicitor.

2720
03:28:54,954 --> 03:28:55,775
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a vacant position.

2721
03:28:56,035 --> 03:28:57,156
[SPEAKER_18]: But KP law, right?

2722
03:28:57,196 --> 03:29:00,138
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what Yeah, he's the only one that can give us a legal opinion.

2723
03:29:00,158 --> 03:29:02,199
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what I'm getting at what just for your edification.

2724
03:29:02,239 --> 03:29:02,800
[SPEAKER_03]: He's talking.

2725
03:29:02,840 --> 03:29:04,121
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, for prior legal.

2726
03:29:04,241 --> 03:29:05,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

2727
03:29:05,442 --> 03:29:05,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

2728
03:29:05,942 --> 03:29:08,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

2729
03:29:08,984 --> 03:29:11,646
[SPEAKER_17]: The city one is a clearly specify that the city needs a city solicitor.

2730
03:29:12,165 --> 03:29:14,853
[SPEAKER_17]: And they say that the city solicitor is the only person in the city.

2731
03:29:15,220 --> 03:29:17,882
[SPEAKER_17]: who can approve an illegal instrument, that can approve a legal instrument.

2732
03:29:18,402 --> 03:29:21,184
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, that's every contract, every collective bargaining agreement.

2733
03:29:21,924 --> 03:29:25,427
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, anything that goes, any local option that we take and send up to the state house.

2734
03:29:26,087 --> 03:29:30,970
[SPEAKER_17]: All of that needs to be approved by a solicitor, a city solicitor that we don't have, because she just said the position's vacant.

2735
03:29:31,291 --> 03:29:32,872
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, our ordinance says it has to be filled.

2736
03:29:33,352 --> 03:29:38,795
[SPEAKER_17]: And our ordinance says that that's the person who's responsible for these major duties and responsibilities in this community.

2737
03:29:39,196 --> 03:29:40,917
[SPEAKER_17]: This position has been vacant for so long.

2738
03:29:40,977 --> 03:29:41,918
[SPEAKER_17]: If they just filled this job,

2739
03:29:42,678 --> 03:29:45,160
[SPEAKER_17]: We wouldn't have these fights, we wouldn't have these arguments, we wouldn't have these issues.

2740
03:29:45,480 --> 03:29:50,743
[SPEAKER_17]: If the mayor just did what you said she was going to do in June, and hired an assistant city solicitor to the council, we wouldn't have these issues.

2741
03:29:51,403 --> 03:29:52,264
[SPEAKER_17]: We wouldn't have them.

2742
03:29:55,166 --> 03:29:58,368
[SPEAKER_03]: So on the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

[SPEAKER_13]: I'm fine.

2759
03:30:16,278 --> 03:30:16,998
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just saying no.

[SPEAKER_18]: in a field where there's a narrow number of candidates, as far as the city solicitor and assistant city solicitor is concerned.

2764
03:30:40,600 --> 03:30:41,281
[SPEAKER_18]: I won't say anymore.

2765
03:30:41,341 --> 03:30:41,681
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

2766
03:30:41,761 --> 03:30:42,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

2767

[SPEAKER_13]: If we could receive and place on file papers 221-631,
