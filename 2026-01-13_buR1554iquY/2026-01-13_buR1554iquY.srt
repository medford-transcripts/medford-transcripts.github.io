[SPEAKER_05]: Councilors Callahan and Tseng and Lazzaro are here by Zoom so they don't get us all sick.

19
00:07:27,099 --> 00:07:38,526
[SPEAKER_05]: Action discussion items today, 26011 offered by Councilor Scarpelli and President Bears's resolution to conduct comprehensive review of the ambulance EMS contract negotiation and transition.

20
00:07:39,026 --> 00:07:44,370
[SPEAKER_05]: How we're going to handle this today is we're going to hear from Councilors first from the sponsor Councilor Scarpelli.

21
00:07:45,751 --> 00:07:47,612
[SPEAKER_05]: If Councilors have initial statements they want to make.

22
00:07:48,112 --> 00:07:50,073
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we'll hear from our city administration.

23
00:07:50,233 --> 00:07:53,415
[SPEAKER_05]: We've invited all parties to be here, so we'll hear from our city administration next.

24
00:07:54,156 --> 00:07:55,576
[SPEAKER_05]: I know Armstrong Ambulance is here.

25
00:07:55,596 --> 00:07:56,377
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll hear from them.

26
00:07:57,397 --> 00:08:07,223
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we'll go to questions from the council, and then if the administration or Armstrong at that point wants to speak again, we'll hear from them, and then we'll have a public participation after that.

27
00:08:07,864 --> 00:08:08,904
[SPEAKER_05]: And that will be how it goes.

28
00:08:10,685 --> 00:08:11,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Recognize Councilor Scarpelli.

29
00:08:13,172 --> 00:08:14,917
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, President Piazza.

30
00:08:14,957 --> 00:08:17,122
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, I thank everybody for being here tonight.

31
00:08:17,143 --> 00:08:19,128
[SPEAKER_09]: The city administration chiefs.

32
00:08:20,871 --> 00:08:30,619
[SPEAKER_09]: Representative from Armstrong Ambulance, I think that last week was a discussion to really start a dialogue to make sure that we're doing what's best for the city of Medford.

33
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:37,183
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it's really three important factors, but the last being the most important.

34
00:08:37,344 --> 00:08:39,685
[SPEAKER_09]: One, the process of negotiation.

35
00:08:40,226 --> 00:08:44,209
[SPEAKER_09]: Two, the contractual understanding of how we do business here in Medford.

36
00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:46,751
[SPEAKER_09]: And then three is public safety affairs.

37
00:08:49,413 --> 00:09:05,067
[SPEAKER_09]: This has been a very interesting week because last week there were things that were said and then I started getting more and more phone calls, feedback from many, many leaders in this field that shared some pretty important insight.

38
00:09:05,528 --> 00:09:12,214
[SPEAKER_09]: But what I wanted to do right now is just start why we're here, why I brought this forward.

39
00:09:14,242 --> 00:09:25,436
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you those who were there last last week understand that this was a personal matter that I took very personal approach with because my parents were both ambulatory.

40
00:09:25,496 --> 00:09:32,766
[SPEAKER_09]: My mother especially had to travel via ambulance three times a week for many years.

41
00:09:33,502 --> 00:09:38,728
[SPEAKER_09]: due to a fight with kidney failure and dialysis.

42
00:09:38,748 --> 00:09:48,077
[SPEAKER_09]: And I saw the efforts of one company in regards to the company that's here before us tonight, Armstrong Ambulance.

43
00:09:48,598 --> 00:09:50,660
[SPEAKER_09]: And I watched the care that they gave my mother.

44
00:09:52,902 --> 00:10:14,971
[SPEAKER_09]: when I did some homework beforehand and I did reach out to a lot of different communities that either share different companies or use different ambulance companies and they were very, very secure in sharing their thoughts that Armstrong is the best provider in the Commonwealth in their eyes.

45
00:10:15,271 --> 00:10:17,312
[SPEAKER_09]: And so what I wanted to,

46
00:10:18,546 --> 00:10:33,950
[SPEAKER_09]: As this happened, we received an email from the mayor as a city council sometime, probably like the second week of December, stating that the mayor is looking into entertaining negotiations with other providers, and that's her prerogative.

47
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:35,931
[SPEAKER_09]: By law, this is what the mayor does.

48
00:10:35,971 --> 00:10:41,653
[SPEAKER_09]: She's in charge of contracts, and this falls under the mayor's direction.

49
00:10:43,707 --> 00:10:45,648
[SPEAKER_09]: I applauded that, let's see what we can do.

50
00:10:47,368 --> 00:11:12,218
[SPEAKER_09]: But I shared my feelings with her and she quickly guided me to our chiefs and I met with the chiefs and I appreciate the chiefs meeting with me and they were very honest and upfront from what they were saying and we heard some key points because it took some key notes and I think that this is why we go full circle.

51
00:11:12,927 --> 00:11:16,371
[SPEAKER_09]: And so you understand why this is so important and why I'm questioning so much.

52
00:11:17,192 --> 00:11:22,798
[SPEAKER_09]: The concerns of EMD concerns, and EMD is, I believe, emergency medical.

53
00:11:24,379 --> 00:11:24,660
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyone?

54
00:11:25,903 --> 00:11:28,986
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been butchering that for two weeks now.

55
00:11:29,547 --> 00:11:31,688
[SPEAKER_09]: But the understanding of what that is.

56
00:11:31,749 --> 00:11:38,195
[SPEAKER_09]: Now what that is, it's the process when a 911 call comes into the call center.

57
00:11:38,735 --> 00:11:46,863
[SPEAKER_09]: We in Medford take that call and then if there's a life-threatening situation, it's then passed on to our

58
00:11:47,523 --> 00:12:02,195
[SPEAKER_09]: ambulance provider that they get right on with the the resident to help them and with any life-saving support while the while they're on the phone to free up our 911 responder if they needed to be free to answer calls.

59
00:12:03,316 --> 00:12:08,700
[SPEAKER_09]: I realized that that was a question and as I looked more into it I've talked to fellow chiefs and neighbor communities and they said

60
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,821
[SPEAKER_09]: George, EMD is very simple.

61
00:12:10,881 --> 00:12:12,242
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a grant through 9-1-1.

62
00:12:12,382 --> 00:12:29,412
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a 9-1-1 response grant that usually the police chief puts into play, and then that money that is put forth or awarded through the grant goes to the provider for providing the service.

63
00:12:30,162 --> 00:12:31,463
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it was very simple.

64
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:33,823
[SPEAKER_09]: So that was one of the questions.

65
00:12:33,883 --> 00:12:41,206
[SPEAKER_09]: Another one was questions about that Armstrong used to provide daily logs and they're not doing that anymore.

66
00:12:41,226 --> 00:12:46,108
[SPEAKER_09]: And the mayor had to get involved to make sure this happens again, which I found alarming.

67
00:12:46,508 --> 00:12:55,732
[SPEAKER_09]: Then there was an issue of a 45-minute response call of a concern or an issue and of a situation that happened sometime this past few months ago.

68
00:12:56,232 --> 00:12:58,353
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was very bothersome to our chiefs.

69
00:12:58,433 --> 00:13:01,134
[SPEAKER_09]: And I said, that's, you're hearing it all?

70
00:13:01,154 --> 00:13:02,375
[SPEAKER_09]: And then he says, you know,

71
00:13:04,516 --> 00:13:08,279
[SPEAKER_09]: You look into, you know, the offering of a behavior ambulance.

72
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:27,575
[SPEAKER_09]: The behavior ambulance is the opportunity for Medford to have a behavior ambulance that's suited with a clinician that helps with any issues dealing with mental health, I believe, or drug addiction where they can streamline the patient to get them assistance as quickly as possible because time is a factor.

73
00:13:28,515 --> 00:13:30,576
[SPEAKER_09]: And I said, geez, OK, you're understanding.

74
00:13:30,596 --> 00:13:32,638
[SPEAKER_09]: He said, OK, I appreciate this phone call.

75
00:13:34,218 --> 00:13:52,849
[SPEAKER_09]: They talked about, we talked about different concerns with the negotiations, issues with contracts, issues that Armstrong owed the city a lot, a lot of money.

76
00:13:53,869 --> 00:13:56,791
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I said, well, that's bothersome.

77
00:13:57,407 --> 00:14:05,795
[SPEAKER_09]: So I did my due diligence, I reached out to the leadership team in Armstrong, and I said, can you give me an insight of what you're seeing?

78
00:14:06,116 --> 00:14:15,545
[SPEAKER_09]: And without leading them any way, they answered and followed up with everything that I said, everything that the chiefs provided to me, but the opposite.

79
00:14:17,229 --> 00:14:18,570
[SPEAKER_09]: And I said, what do you mean?

80
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:20,932
[SPEAKER_09]: So the behavior bust, that's a big issue, right?

81
00:14:20,972 --> 00:14:21,653
[SPEAKER_09]: We see it on the news.

82
00:14:21,713 --> 00:14:31,842
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're like, yeah, well, we offered this three years ago when we had our friend Penelope in our office here that they were working together with our city administration to bring that to Medford.

83
00:14:32,283 --> 00:14:34,044
[SPEAKER_09]: But three years ago, that fell through the cracks.

84
00:14:34,485 --> 00:14:36,126
[SPEAKER_09]: But they said, it's in this contract.

85
00:14:36,186 --> 00:14:38,609
[SPEAKER_09]: We're moving forward with this in this contract.

86
00:14:38,969 --> 00:14:40,911
[SPEAKER_09]: We'd like to keep it in Medford, and then

87
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:47,836
[SPEAKER_09]: it'll host for Melrose, I believe, Stoneham, Arlington, so it'll be based here in Medford.

88
00:14:47,856 --> 00:14:49,398
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, oh, that's great news.

89
00:14:49,938 --> 00:14:52,480
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we talked about this response time.

90
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:57,544
[SPEAKER_09]: I said, jeez, I'm confused why you're not providing daily documents.

91
00:14:58,225 --> 00:15:03,970
[SPEAKER_09]: And Mr. Mangan reported, he says, George, I'm confused, because the question was this.

92
00:15:04,729 --> 00:15:09,831
[SPEAKER_09]: When Chief Gilliberti was in place, he put a format in place where they would get the run times.

93
00:15:09,871 --> 00:15:14,413
[SPEAKER_09]: At the end of the day, everything that happened in Medford, so he would look into every issue.

94
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:21,096
[SPEAKER_09]: If they found it to be a concern, he would then call Armstrong in the morning to meet right away to see if there were any concerns that they can fix.

95
00:15:22,837 --> 00:15:28,320
[SPEAKER_09]: What Mr. Mangan then expressed was when Chief Freeman came in, Chief Freeman said, you know what?

96
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,760
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't require daily.

97
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:31,041
[SPEAKER_09]: I require monthly.

98
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:32,573
[SPEAKER_09]: And I said, OK.

99
00:15:32,633 --> 00:15:38,696
[SPEAKER_09]: And I said, in this administration, his response was, I don't know.

100
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:39,556
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing has changed.

101
00:15:39,576 --> 00:15:40,837
[SPEAKER_09]: So we've just been providing monthly.

102
00:15:41,737 --> 00:15:42,597
[SPEAKER_09]: So I said, OK.

103
00:15:43,638 --> 00:15:44,358
[SPEAKER_09]: It was something that

104
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,251
[SPEAKER_09]: That was something that was very important.

105
00:15:46,271 --> 00:15:56,656
[SPEAKER_09]: I said, what was bothersome that, you know, they talked about this 45 minute runtime that Mr. Mangan said, well, I'll be honest with you, George, within five minutes of us finding out, we self-reported here at Armstrong.

106
00:15:57,036 --> 00:16:01,698
[SPEAKER_09]: We sent the information over to Medford and we expressed how the situation came about.

107
00:16:02,138 --> 00:16:08,681
[SPEAKER_09]: We took 50% ownership and we wanted to bring it forward so we can make Medford understand someone else dropped the ball along the line.

108
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:10,022
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to correct this and move forward.

109
00:16:10,582 --> 00:16:15,025
[SPEAKER_09]: And then there was a question about some documentation not lining up.

110
00:16:15,705 --> 00:16:20,648
[SPEAKER_09]: So once Mr. Mangan noticed that, he then corrected it, sent it back to the administration.

111
00:16:20,668 --> 00:16:22,709
[SPEAKER_09]: The administration said, thank you for your quick response.

112
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:26,812
[SPEAKER_09]: So I said, geez, this is a little confusing.

113
00:16:27,372 --> 00:16:29,473
[SPEAKER_09]: I was a little taken back.

114
00:16:29,493 --> 00:16:36,998
[SPEAKER_09]: They said, okay, so what, you know, but the biggest thing that they brought forward is this, what was owed to them financially?

115
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:47,199
[SPEAKER_09]: that the city was claiming that Armstrong owed the city of Medford an exaggerated amount of money, over $200,000 possibly.

116
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,600
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe they can correct it, but I think it was even talking $400,000 or $500,000.

117
00:16:53,721 --> 00:17:03,763
[SPEAKER_09]: And they provided me with a contract that specifically says that the administration has to request that funding every year of $75,000 as long as it lined

118
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:09,075
[SPEAKER_09]: legally, and there was documentation.

119
00:17:09,415 --> 00:17:17,999
[SPEAKER_09]: They also shared how Chief Gilliberti went through the process and how he would come in with all the accounting information, everything lined up.

120
00:17:18,479 --> 00:17:28,483
[SPEAKER_09]: They would go through the process because, quote unquote, as the administration from Armstrong responded saying that this is this is federal law and we don't want to

121
00:17:29,398 --> 00:17:29,898
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't want to go.

122
00:17:30,358 --> 00:17:31,999
[SPEAKER_09]: This could be something to put everybody in trouble.

123
00:17:32,019 --> 00:17:34,400
[SPEAKER_09]: So we just want to protect Medford and want to protect Armstrong.

124
00:17:35,001 --> 00:17:50,968
[SPEAKER_09]: There was another issue that was said that the concern was that Armstrong in the past would always transport Medford first responders that needed an ambulance to from from the city to to the hospital.

125
00:17:51,827 --> 00:18:00,531
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's something that the chiefs shared with me that when Mr. Mangan shared, he says what we said was we weren't stopping that.

126
00:18:00,952 --> 00:18:06,574
[SPEAKER_09]: We needed to put it in the contract, protect Medford and Armstrong again.

127
00:18:07,155 --> 00:18:18,060
[SPEAKER_09]: And I believe another person sent me Waltham's contract that specifically reads what Armstrong was explaining to me was that they just wanted to make sure that

128
00:18:19,175 --> 00:18:29,702
[SPEAKER_09]: It was for Method's first responders or employees that happened during the day or during the course of business.

129
00:18:30,223 --> 00:18:34,245
[SPEAKER_09]: Not at home having the chest pain and saying, well, I'm a Method employee.

130
00:18:34,545 --> 00:18:35,626
[SPEAKER_09]: I get a free ambulance ride.

131
00:18:36,147 --> 00:18:40,569
[SPEAKER_09]: So I said, geez, when I heard all this, I said, this is pretty self-explanatory.

132
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:41,210
[SPEAKER_09]: This is pretty good.

133
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:45,553
[SPEAKER_09]: I said, so my last question was, who are you negotiating with?

134
00:18:47,202 --> 00:18:50,067
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they were confused, as well as my chiefs were.

135
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,389
[SPEAKER_09]: They were a little confused.

136
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:57,659
[SPEAKER_09]: They didn't know the process and who was taking it over and whose hands it was in.

137
00:18:58,857 --> 00:19:11,941
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that maybe Armstrong could shed some light later that who they met with on a more regular basis and how that process went through that, you know, a former city solicitor was part of this process.

138
00:19:12,061 --> 00:19:19,203
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, you know, learning some other, I've learned so many things in the last week that the number one person in our

139
00:19:20,143 --> 00:19:29,306
[SPEAKER_09]: first responder system is is Lieutenant Captain Barry Clemente that worked closely with Armstrong for many years but wasn't part of this process.

140
00:19:29,986 --> 00:19:41,629
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's so many different questions with this that I felt that it needed to be public and I'll be honest with you I asked the mayor I said I said this is I expressed to have what I

141
00:19:43,311 --> 00:19:44,992
[SPEAKER_09]: I asked for one more meeting.

142
00:19:45,672 --> 00:19:49,854
[SPEAKER_09]: I said, it seems to be that I'm the only person talking to both parties.

143
00:19:52,195 --> 00:19:59,099
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's a void, because what the chiefs told me and what Armstrong responded with, there was a huge disconnect.

144
00:19:59,459 --> 00:20:00,199
[SPEAKER_09]: There were no issues.

145
00:20:00,779 --> 00:20:01,840
[SPEAKER_09]: It was just a conversation.

146
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:06,002
[SPEAKER_09]: At least that's what I witnessed in these conversations.

147
00:20:07,594 --> 00:20:26,463
[SPEAKER_09]: sent an email to the chiefs and the mayors and I requested please can we do this one one time what I what I'm scared of is what this process will mean moving down the road because I did do some homework in other other companies and it didn't come back favorably and it made me very nervous and the response was

148
00:20:27,163 --> 00:20:28,924
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the five of us negotiated.

149
00:20:29,445 --> 00:20:30,846
[SPEAKER_09]: There was five on the negotiating team.

150
00:20:30,886 --> 00:20:31,706
[SPEAKER_09]: They feel very strong.

151
00:20:31,746 --> 00:20:32,527
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't agree with me.

152
00:20:32,547 --> 00:20:33,027
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's fine.

153
00:20:33,047 --> 00:20:33,607
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't have to.

154
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:35,649
[SPEAKER_09]: But all I asked for was for one more meeting.

155
00:20:36,209 --> 00:20:39,511
[SPEAKER_09]: And what was said was that I said, well, I was honest.

156
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:40,672
[SPEAKER_09]: I said, I'm going to have to go public.

157
00:20:40,692 --> 00:20:42,453
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to speak with my fellow Councilors.

158
00:20:42,493 --> 00:20:46,396
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're going to move this forward to the public so we can talk about it.

159
00:20:46,436 --> 00:20:51,699
[SPEAKER_09]: Because while this was going on, the community was informed that we're changing providers.

160
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,281
[SPEAKER_09]: And the big question to everybody was, why?

161
00:20:55,482 --> 00:20:55,662
[SPEAKER_09]: Why?

162
00:20:57,102 --> 00:21:05,526
[SPEAKER_09]: So that leads us to where we are today, because I believe the mayor explained to me that it's not good to go public.

163
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:08,267
[SPEAKER_09]: She didn't want to embarrass Armstrong.

164
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:11,028
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'll do respect to Armstrong or the city.

165
00:21:11,068 --> 00:21:11,749
[SPEAKER_09]: I could care less.

166
00:21:11,809 --> 00:21:20,333
[SPEAKER_09]: My job's number one priority is the safety and the well-being of our community and making sure that we're doing what we're supposed to be doing with our fiduciary responsibility as well.

167
00:21:20,393 --> 00:21:22,994
[SPEAKER_09]: So for me tonight, you're going to hear three things.

168
00:21:23,154 --> 00:21:25,055
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to ask questions about,

169
00:21:26,314 --> 00:21:27,414
[SPEAKER_09]: the negotiation process.

170
00:21:27,635 --> 00:21:31,756
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to ask the process of contract contracts and what was said.

171
00:21:32,336 --> 00:21:34,476
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the last piece is going to be the public safety piece.

172
00:21:34,856 --> 00:21:35,837
[SPEAKER_09]: And are we prepared?

173
00:21:36,817 --> 00:21:40,318
[SPEAKER_09]: Because there are a lot of questions that are we prepared for the handoff?

174
00:21:40,378 --> 00:21:41,698
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe is January 19th.

175
00:21:42,579 --> 00:21:44,999
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so that's that's why we're here.

176
00:21:45,019 --> 00:21:50,801
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope I set the table so everybody understands why, why I brought this forward.

177
00:21:50,821 --> 00:21:53,482
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, it's with no malice at all.

178
00:21:53,682 --> 00:21:54,722
[SPEAKER_09]: I have nothing to gain.

179
00:21:56,263 --> 00:21:58,764
[SPEAKER_09]: except making sure that our community is safe.

180
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:01,925
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you, Mr. President.

181
00:22:03,266 --> 00:22:04,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

182
00:22:04,986 --> 00:22:05,607
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Leming.

183
00:22:07,167 --> 00:22:11,809
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd just like to reiterate my support for my colleague bringing this forward.

184
00:22:11,929 --> 00:22:14,410
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a very personal issue with him.

185
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:14,830
[SPEAKER_11]: He's brought a

186
00:22:15,798 --> 00:22:21,766
[SPEAKER_11]: put a lot of work into it and I appreciate the due diligence and effort that went into this process.

187
00:22:21,806 --> 00:22:26,112
[SPEAKER_11]: The only thing that I would like to add is that last meeting the

188
00:22:27,228 --> 00:22:47,171
[SPEAKER_11]: line of thought kept coming up that we shouldn't be doing this just because we should just be trusting in the process and not, and the idea that we should just trust folks who make these decisions and just not have a second meeting, et cetera, et cetera, that kept coming up.

189
00:22:47,472 --> 00:22:55,613
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's something I strongly disagree with, because as soon as this announcement was made, we saw a lot of public outrage over it.

190
00:22:56,273 --> 00:22:57,673
[SPEAKER_11]: And people didn't really know why.

191
00:22:57,733 --> 00:23:00,894
[SPEAKER_11]: People didn't really know what happened behind the scenes.

192
00:23:01,374 --> 00:23:03,855
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's something that folks are increasingly curious about.

193
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:13,458
[SPEAKER_11]: So I hope that when people talk tonight, when people give some insight into the behind the scenes, they don't try to push back on public accountability.

194
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:15,018
[SPEAKER_11]: Because yes, we're having a meeting.

195
00:23:15,938 --> 00:23:21,940
[SPEAKER_11]: This is one of the few mechanisms by which some of these things can become public.

196
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,621
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm glad that we're doing this.

197
00:23:26,102 --> 00:23:35,230
[SPEAKER_11]: The aspect of this that I would personally like to be convinced of is that this switch was made with public safety in mind.

198
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:48,742
[SPEAKER_11]: This switch was made with the health and safety of the residents of Medford in mind and not because of a breakdown in negotiations, not because of an internal breakdown in communication.

199
00:23:51,105 --> 00:24:08,152
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of what I've been hearing has not really convinced me that this decision was made entirely with public safety in mind.

200
00:24:08,172 --> 00:24:15,034
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of what I'm hearing seems to indicate that this was due to internal arguments, miscommunications, and so on.

201
00:24:18,536 --> 00:24:35,647
[SPEAKER_11]: invite both parties, all parties that were involved in this to give their side of the story and clearly illustrate what happened behind the scenes, which I think the union and Armstrong did pretty clearly last meeting.

202
00:24:36,348 --> 00:24:43,853
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you very much and I look forward to hearing what folks have to say.

203
00:24:46,033 --> 00:24:47,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Leming.

204
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,909
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Malayne.

205
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:57,485
[SPEAKER_21]: I also want to thank Councilor Scarpelli for bringing this forward, and certainly what Councilor Leming has shared as well.

206
00:24:57,505 --> 00:25:04,491
[SPEAKER_21]: I think we've heard at least, I've received a lot of feedback from the public as well over the course of the past week.

207
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:13,018
[SPEAKER_21]: Not only just about the contract itself, but just things that were said at the meeting last time, things that weren't really clarified.

208
00:25:13,058 --> 00:25:18,403
[SPEAKER_21]: I think for all of us, it would just be helpful to know the contract as longstanding as it had been with Armstrong.

209
00:25:18,943 --> 00:25:24,006
[SPEAKER_21]: Just what were we looking for then in this contract this next time around that was different than in previous years?

210
00:25:24,567 --> 00:25:27,748
[SPEAKER_21]: What are some of those changes that we saw to make this type of a decision?

211
00:25:28,449 --> 00:25:33,732
[SPEAKER_21]: And to just give us a bit more and the public a bit more clear cut answers on what those decisions were.

212
00:25:33,752 --> 00:25:43,898
[SPEAKER_21]: Because I do think that is a constant theme that we keep, or I should say I keep hearing, is not getting kind of the full picture of everything that went by behind it.

213
00:25:43,998 --> 00:25:46,820
[SPEAKER_21]: That the public should be able to have more of a sense of,

214
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:54,403
[SPEAKER_21]: with such a critically important service and one that my family has used several times in the past several years.

215
00:25:54,944 --> 00:26:02,747
[SPEAKER_21]: I know just how important it is to make sure that we're definitely going through all of our due diligence to make sure that we have the right people in place for it.

216
00:26:03,047 --> 00:26:10,370
[SPEAKER_21]: So I look forward to the conversation tonight and just getting a better sense from each of the different parties where we stand and how we can move forward from here.

217
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:11,351
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

218
00:26:17,233 --> 00:26:40,020
[SPEAKER_04]: I can be super brief because I I'm sure we'll get into more details after but I would like to reiterate what I think me and what the council said at last Tuesday's meeting which is that at the end of the day we just want to understand why this decision is

219
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:45,942
[SPEAKER_04]: makes us safe or safer than what we had before.

220
00:26:46,742 --> 00:26:52,925
[SPEAKER_04]: And my worry is that we didn't hear a clear-cut answer to that question at last week's meeting.

221
00:26:53,065 --> 00:26:55,606
[SPEAKER_04]: And hopefully tonight we can get a better picture.

222
00:26:56,366 --> 00:26:57,707
[SPEAKER_04]: But that was my worry then.

223
00:26:59,227 --> 00:27:04,069
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think I want to reiterate that, you know,

224
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:17,556
[SPEAKER_04]: We should be making these decisions because of real factors, because of real reasons, and cost, while important, is not something that should be balanced on the backs of the safety of our residents.

225
00:27:17,797 --> 00:27:22,899
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm curious about, you know, comparisons with response times.

226
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:30,364
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm curious about level of service, about getting into the details about the behaviour of bus and whatnot, about the process.

227
00:27:31,004 --> 00:27:31,324
[SPEAKER_04]: I think

228
00:27:32,585 --> 00:27:46,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Regardless of where you stand on which provider, which contract at the end of the day, there are some real rumors and rumors and accusations to dispel and quash.

229
00:27:48,655 --> 00:27:52,978
[SPEAKER_04]: And as someone said at last week's meeting, Sunlight is the real disinfectant here.

230
00:27:53,418 --> 00:27:55,519
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm grateful that we are having this committee of the whole.

231
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,460
[SPEAKER_04]: I look forward to getting the answers.

232
00:27:58,761 --> 00:28:01,623
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you for everyone for showing up today.

233
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:07,459
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

234
00:28:08,099 --> 00:28:16,062
[SPEAKER_18]: I do appreciate this being brought up and I appreciate it coming for a meeting tonight where we can really get into details.

235
00:28:17,363 --> 00:28:32,068
[SPEAKER_18]: My concern and my questions are that it is my understanding and I would appreciate hearing from people involved whether this is accurate that when you change an ambulance service for your city,

236
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:37,025
[SPEAKER_18]: That comes at a cost and I don't mean cost financially.

237
00:28:37,085 --> 00:28:42,192
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, that comes at a cost to the health and safety of our residents.

238
00:28:43,105 --> 00:28:59,571
[SPEAKER_18]: simply making that change from an organization that has been doing ambulance service here for 20 plus years to one that has not been doing it here for the last couple of decades, that comes at a cost of safety.

239
00:29:00,111 --> 00:29:04,473
[SPEAKER_18]: So I would love to have that addressed and then

240
00:29:05,675 --> 00:29:20,881
[SPEAKER_18]: The other thing that I really want addressed is there were some vague talks last week about that, oh, there were things in the contract that we weren't happy with.

241
00:29:21,581 --> 00:29:24,282
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to know exactly why this change was made.

242
00:29:24,823 --> 00:29:26,803
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to know what it was about the contract.

243
00:29:26,923 --> 00:29:29,124
[SPEAKER_18]: And I also would really appreciate

244
00:29:30,885 --> 00:29:39,712
[SPEAKER_18]: I do appreciate Councilor Scarpelli giving us a little bit of understanding about how ambulance services are paid for by a city, but I want something more specific.

245
00:29:39,752 --> 00:29:55,004
[SPEAKER_18]: I want that to come for the public of how ambulance services are paid and specifically what about the contract with Armstrong was no longer acceptable or had changed and was unacceptable.

246
00:29:57,186 --> 00:30:06,533
[SPEAKER_18]: I just want clarity on why this change was made, because it is my understanding that when you make a change like this, it comes at a cost to our safety of our residents.

247
00:30:06,933 --> 00:30:07,233
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

248
00:30:09,215 --> 00:30:09,635
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

249
00:30:09,655 --> 00:30:10,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Lazzaro.

250
00:30:15,139 --> 00:30:15,499
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

251
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:19,452
[SPEAKER_19]: I echo a lot of what my colleagues have said.

252
00:30:19,592 --> 00:30:27,859
[SPEAKER_19]: I really appreciate the transparency, our opportunity here to bring some things to light that our residents have asked about.

253
00:30:27,879 --> 00:30:37,887
[SPEAKER_19]: Our role as city council is often to take questions that are raised by residents and bring the answers to the public.

254
00:30:38,388 --> 00:30:40,469
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not necessarily that our

255
00:30:41,488 --> 00:31:04,705
[SPEAKER_19]: public safety people or that anybody who works for the administration is not doing things in a proper way, but it's that residents have asked us questions we can't necessarily answer, but what we can do is bring those questions to the people that have the answers, bring the answers forward in a public forum, and we can get those answers to people who want to know.

256
00:31:04,725 --> 00:31:06,947
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think that

257
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:11,841
[SPEAKER_19]: that is the critical opportunity that we have here.

258
00:31:11,921 --> 00:31:21,804
[SPEAKER_19]: And I really appreciate Councilor Scarpelli for bringing it forward, giving us the chance to do this in committee is a great opportunity for us to air these questions publicly.

259
00:31:22,284 --> 00:31:24,504
[SPEAKER_19]: That is what our job is.

260
00:31:24,744 --> 00:31:27,765
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's not, nobody's on blast, nobody's in trouble.

261
00:31:27,825 --> 00:31:32,366
[SPEAKER_19]: All we're doing here is making it possible for everybody to have these questions answered.

262
00:31:34,755 --> 00:31:35,996
[SPEAKER_19]: Nobody has anything to hide.

263
00:31:36,056 --> 00:31:37,918
[SPEAKER_19]: Nobody has done anything wrong necessarily.

264
00:31:37,998 --> 00:31:40,940
[SPEAKER_19]: And if there is something that we are unsure about, now we can know.

265
00:31:41,501 --> 00:31:56,593
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think that that is a wonderful opportunity for public transparency and trust, building trust between different branches of government and between the public and government that's making decisions that impact people's lives and health and wellbeing.

266
00:31:57,154 --> 00:32:00,176
[SPEAKER_19]: So I appreciate the opportunity and I'm looking forward to the rest of the discussion.

267
00:32:00,476 --> 00:32:01,097
[SPEAKER_19]: So thank you.

268
00:32:02,988 --> 00:32:04,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Vice President Lazzaro.

269
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:08,230
[SPEAKER_05]: I think my colleagues have said pretty much everything that I would want to say.

270
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:18,695
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really just interested in the analysis by the administration that led to this decision and understanding how it maintains or improves public safety in our city.

271
00:32:19,375 --> 00:32:23,017
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that, I will turn this over to our city administration.

272
00:32:23,037 --> 00:32:29,079
[SPEAKER_05]: We have the chief of staff, our police and fire chief, our dispatch head are all here.

273
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:31,080
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm happy to hear from them.

274
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:43,933
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening.

275
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:53,463
[SPEAKER_14]: So I want to start, thank you President Bears, thank you members of the council.

276
00:32:53,743 --> 00:32:56,125
[SPEAKER_14]: Honestly, I wish we weren't here today.

277
00:32:56,145 --> 00:32:57,866
[SPEAKER_14]: I think you all know that.

278
00:32:58,166 --> 00:33:02,649
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to state that we frankly just didn't want this to drag on.

279
00:33:02,909 --> 00:33:07,913
[SPEAKER_14]: I also want to state very clearly that we didn't want to cast shade on Armstrong Ambulance, but here we are.

280
00:33:10,475 --> 00:33:15,938
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're going to take this up and we're going to have the conversation and hopefully the questions will be answered this evening.

281
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:26,385
[SPEAKER_14]: Frankly, changing companies is a reasonable thing for the city to do, whether it's in this line of service or other lines of services.

282
00:33:27,065 --> 00:33:32,669
[SPEAKER_14]: It's what the city should be doing when it analyzes the services that it receives from outside vendors at all times.

283
00:33:33,009 --> 00:33:41,574
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not to say that we don't value the services that were provided in the past or the employees who have provided those services under the management of any company.

284
00:33:46,059 --> 00:33:52,462
[SPEAKER_14]: But based on what the city has experienced, we believe it was a reasonable and sound business decision to go a different route.

285
00:33:53,703 --> 00:33:55,884
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, we'll discuss that here today.

286
00:33:56,964 --> 00:34:03,928
[SPEAKER_14]: Hope that you'll give us time this week to fully explain what's going on, because last week we were told repeatedly that there wasn't enough time.

287
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:11,071
[SPEAKER_14]: That was one of the shortest meetings I've seen of the city council, but maybe the council had reasons that I'm not aware of.

288
00:34:12,301 --> 00:34:17,743
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think just to clarify that before you continue, we said that the resolution was to have a meeting dedicated to it.

289
00:34:19,143 --> 00:34:21,204
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm just going to be honest.

290
00:34:21,804 --> 00:34:26,965
[SPEAKER_05]: I think to say both we shouldn't talk about it at all and we didn't have enough time to talk about it, it's a bit of a strange frame.

291
00:34:27,225 --> 00:34:28,806
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'll turn the floor back over to you.

292
00:34:29,314 --> 00:34:30,174
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, President Bears.

293
00:34:30,254 --> 00:34:33,255
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, the reality is, again, we don't want to cast shade on the company.

294
00:34:33,295 --> 00:34:35,556
[SPEAKER_14]: But again, here we are, and we, we're going through it.

295
00:34:37,797 --> 00:34:46,719
[SPEAKER_14]: I also want to caveat that any comments made by me, communications, a supervisor, Salvy, or our chiefs are not a negative reflection on Armstrong employees.

296
00:34:46,799 --> 00:34:49,180
[SPEAKER_14]: Instead, they're a reflection on Armstrong management.

297
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:54,642
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't believe that Armstrong management is being forthcoming with employees as to what has transpired over time.

298
00:34:56,163 --> 00:35:08,754
[SPEAKER_14]: So that, I'm gonna go through now a bit of a timeline and share with the council and the chiefs and our supervisor can elaborate on these topics tonight.

299
00:35:10,916 --> 00:35:16,941
[SPEAKER_14]: As far as timeline is concerned, we need to go back to when our current fire chief began to raise questions on the Armstrong contract.

300
00:35:17,793 --> 00:35:19,455
[SPEAKER_14]: shortly after becoming Provisional Chief.

301
00:35:20,256 --> 00:35:24,901
[SPEAKER_14]: He was making requests for reports that were required by contract for the runs and response times.

302
00:35:25,722 --> 00:35:29,947
[SPEAKER_14]: Armstrong sent some information over, but nothing to the degree that was required by contract.

303
00:35:31,288 --> 00:35:34,772
[SPEAKER_14]: The Chief continued to ask for reports from at least July of 2024 through January of 2025.

304
00:35:40,803 --> 00:35:45,986
[SPEAKER_14]: The Chief began emailing Armstrong in January of 2025 to follow up on prior requests for reports.

305
00:35:46,787 --> 00:35:52,210
[SPEAKER_14]: Armstrong responded that they were changing their systems and would get information over for what they had at the time.

306
00:35:53,131 --> 00:35:59,095
[SPEAKER_14]: The Chief did not get reporting at that point, and that they were not forthcoming with further information, and he had to continue to press them.

307
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:05,274
[SPEAKER_14]: In March of 2025, we were inquiring with Armstrong on payments that were not being made by Armstrong to the city.

308
00:36:05,314 --> 00:36:11,558
[SPEAKER_14]: This was referenced this evening by Councilor Scarapelli with regard to reimbursements that were due under the contract to the city.

309
00:36:13,381 --> 00:36:30,920
[SPEAKER_14]: After that, Armstrong went in to meet with the chief of police and effectively made statements that they were not going to make the $75,000 payments that were due per year to the city as part of the contractual agreement, and they were saying that they weren't going to

310
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:49,686
[SPEAKER_14]: They were going to change things to the city that were not previously charged before, specifically emergency medical dispatch on the order of $25,000 to $30,000, and that they were going to start charging for transporting city's first responders when they sustained injuries on the job.

311
00:36:51,086 --> 00:36:56,928
[SPEAKER_14]: Based on this, Armstrong was effectively showing signs that they were going to change more and not honor the contract.

312
00:36:57,749 --> 00:36:59,729
[SPEAKER_14]: That was a significant turning point for the city.

313
00:37:03,544 --> 00:37:08,268
[SPEAKER_14]: It was after that that the city began planning to consider negotiating with other ambulance providers.

314
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:19,537
[SPEAKER_14]: The chief of fire followed up with them on multiple times to the point where he had to write Armstrong in April and copy the mayor to elevate the issue for the lack of responsiveness.

315
00:37:22,759 --> 00:37:32,487
[SPEAKER_14]: We started getting reports in April of 2025, but the accuracy of those reports subsequently was identified as an issue and Chief Evans can describe and discuss that in further detail.

316
00:37:35,148 --> 00:37:41,972
[SPEAKER_14]: When the team, the negotiating team met to discuss the ambulance contract and negotiations, other concerns were raised, and I'll go through those briefly here today.

317
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:48,575
[SPEAKER_14]: There was an exclusion of information on Armstrong's reporting, as I stated earlier.

318
00:37:50,744 --> 00:37:57,350
[SPEAKER_14]: Where reporting is not accurate, the chiefs and Supervisor Salve and the mayor have an even larger loss of trust.

319
00:37:57,410 --> 00:38:05,697
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, if you look at the timeline that I just identified, we have a situation where Armstrong has identified that they're not gonna honor their contract.

320
00:38:06,037 --> 00:38:12,202
[SPEAKER_14]: That poses a significant milestone in the contractual agreement between the city and the party of Armstrong.

321
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,303
[SPEAKER_14]: Then we have a situation where we identify that reports are simply not accurate.

322
00:38:19,003 --> 00:38:26,308
[SPEAKER_14]: And it brings into question the level of faith that the city can place on the information that's being provided by Armstrong.

323
00:38:27,128 --> 00:38:30,170
[SPEAKER_14]: There's quotes of response time.

324
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:33,092
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, we have data that suggests that

325
00:38:34,272 --> 00:38:40,214
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a number of examples where that response time doesn't seem to line up with the information we have.

326
00:38:40,554 --> 00:38:44,916
[SPEAKER_14]: The time in which the call was dispatched, the time in which is written on their reports.

327
00:38:45,316 --> 00:38:47,757
[SPEAKER_14]: But again, Chief Evans can elaborate on that.

328
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:54,572
[SPEAKER_14]: Then there were specific incidents in which there have been significant response times.

329
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:58,474
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of those have been brought up here tonight and last week.

330
00:38:58,775 --> 00:39:01,496
[SPEAKER_14]: There was a 45-minute incident that was brought up.

331
00:39:01,896 --> 00:39:07,059
[SPEAKER_14]: We can get into greater detail on that, as well as a number of other incidents that Supervisor Salvi can discuss.

332
00:39:09,895 --> 00:39:12,976
[SPEAKER_14]: There seemed to be a lack of training for the ambulances that was requested.

333
00:39:13,636 --> 00:39:15,177
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, this is tracking, not training.

334
00:39:16,977 --> 00:39:21,999
[SPEAKER_14]: At some point in the process, the city began to ask for tracking information for the ambulances.

335
00:39:22,039 --> 00:39:32,562
[SPEAKER_14]: So the dispatch system could, the dispatchers and the dispatch division of the city could essentially track the ambulances and provide a

336
00:39:33,782 --> 00:39:44,752
[SPEAKER_14]: proper dispatch system so that, you know, they could simply state, Ambulance 2, I don't know the proper terminology, but please respond to XYZ Street because you're closest.

337
00:39:45,573 --> 00:39:47,154
[SPEAKER_14]: That tracking information came late.

338
00:39:47,595 --> 00:39:55,903
[SPEAKER_14]: By the time we did get the tracker, we could see that there were Medford ambulances in another community, in particular in Arlington, on a frequent basis.

339
00:39:56,363 --> 00:39:58,045
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, we can go into that as well.

340
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:13,171
[SPEAKER_14]: There was a, in our opinions, there was a lack of investment in both staffing the, the ambulance provider with, with sufficient staff by way of their personnel.

341
00:40:14,752 --> 00:40:17,514
[SPEAKER_14]: Lack of investment in ambulances and AEDs.

342
00:40:18,394 --> 00:40:19,615
[SPEAKER_14]: They were not buying more trucks.

343
00:40:20,016 --> 00:40:21,497
[SPEAKER_14]: They were not staffing up in time.

344
00:40:21,617 --> 00:40:24,339
[SPEAKER_14]: They were, they appeared to be spreading thin in Arlington.

345
00:40:25,802 --> 00:40:27,023
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't really have an issue.

346
00:40:27,043 --> 00:40:29,005
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think the Chiefs or anyone has an issue.

347
00:40:29,485 --> 00:40:31,927
[SPEAKER_14]: Supervisor Salve has an issue with mutual aid, right?

348
00:40:31,988 --> 00:40:42,577
[SPEAKER_14]: We, we understand that there is a mutual aid component, but we kept finding more and more that Armstrong was in Arlington and was, was getting to us much later than usual.

349
00:40:45,633 --> 00:40:56,818
[SPEAKER_14]: Cataldo also mentioned offers that were beneficial to the city, such as EMT training at the high school, which was an appeal, just to mention that, because it's not necessarily in line with the other comments.

350
00:40:56,878 --> 00:41:06,783
[SPEAKER_14]: But at one point, we asked Armstrong if they could train firefighters as EMTs, and it wasn't until Armstrong found out that Cataldo was gonna do it that they offered the same.

351
00:41:07,263 --> 00:41:14,947
[SPEAKER_14]: In fact, in March of 2025, when Armstrong approached the chief and spoke with both of our chiefs, they were saying that they wouldn't do that type of thing.

352
00:41:17,473 --> 00:41:22,995
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, realistically, the city could have gone with the status quo and all of this would have been much less of a headache.

353
00:41:23,636 --> 00:41:30,699
[SPEAKER_14]: But the chiefs, Supervisor Salve and the mayor felt that what was in the best interest of the city was to evaluate options.

354
00:41:31,339 --> 00:41:36,101
[SPEAKER_14]: And in that evaluation process, they determined that the best for the city was to go a different route.

355
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:49,393
[SPEAKER_14]: We believe that Cataldo will bring response to a better place, response times to a better place, because again we question the accuracy of the information that's presented by Armstrong on the reports that they provide.

356
00:41:52,535 --> 00:41:58,199
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I'll pause there and I'll turn it to maybe Chief Evans to begin on

357
00:42:00,696 --> 00:42:17,333
[SPEAKER_14]: areas that I touched on that we could elaborate in depth and then go to, actually, I think I've, Chief Buckley, I apologize, then Chief Evans, and then we'll go through the rest.

358
00:42:19,054 --> 00:42:19,335
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

359
00:42:19,815 --> 00:42:21,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Madam Chief of Staff, Chief Buckley.

360
00:42:25,972 --> 00:42:27,013
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Madam Chief of Staff.

361
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:30,495
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President, for allowing me to be here to speak.

362
00:42:31,956 --> 00:42:35,359
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess it's best that I start where I left off last time.

363
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:40,823
[SPEAKER_13]: I was lucky enough to be the person where I guess we could say this all began.

364
00:42:41,163 --> 00:42:54,553
[SPEAKER_13]: It was in my office where statements from Armstrong Ambulance were made directly to me about the current state of the contract that they were working under and the provisions that they wished to change.

365
00:42:55,345 --> 00:43:05,668
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think it's important that we start there, because I think it's important that we understand that what actually kind of started this, what precipitated a lot of this change.

366
00:43:06,328 --> 00:43:15,090
[SPEAKER_13]: So sometime at the end of March, I was asked if Armstrong could come to see me and have a meeting in my office.

367
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:16,770
[SPEAKER_13]: I naturally agreed.

368
00:43:17,431 --> 00:43:22,232
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was during that meeting that Armstrong personnel stated to me that

369
00:43:23,582 --> 00:43:35,908
[SPEAKER_13]: They would no longer, or they did not believe that they were required to pay the monies that were due to the city of Medford based on the current contract that they were working on.

370
00:43:37,028 --> 00:43:45,272
[SPEAKER_13]: Those monies were $75,000 a year, slated for dispatch based on a reimbursement type system.

371
00:43:46,797 --> 00:43:50,558
[SPEAKER_13]: and they had not been paid for four years at the time.

372
00:43:51,138 --> 00:44:06,643
[SPEAKER_13]: It's also during this meeting that they stated that other changes they felt were necessary to practices, one of them being the requirement or their provision of emergency medical dispatch to the city of Medford and that they were going to start to

373
00:44:07,923 --> 00:44:11,245
[SPEAKER_13]: charge us for those services.

374
00:44:12,085 --> 00:44:17,047
[SPEAKER_13]: I asked at the time what those costs would be, and they gave me an estimate of about $25,000 per year.

375
00:44:17,868 --> 00:44:19,449
[SPEAKER_13]: Additional statements of member aid were

376
00:44:21,778 --> 00:44:31,385
[SPEAKER_13]: Things such as training of firefighters and the idea of if a municipal employee, I'll use a police officer's example, you're involved in a cruiser accident, you get transported to the hospital.

377
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:38,330
[SPEAKER_13]: We were not charged for those costs and that we, Armstrong believed at that time that they were going to have to charge us for those costs.

378
00:44:38,991 --> 00:44:45,196
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, I understand the open remarks made by Councilor Scarpelli and the statements that Armstrong is making today.

379
00:44:45,936 --> 00:44:50,400
[SPEAKER_13]: What I'm here to tell you is what was made, the statements that were made to me in my office.

380
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,182
[SPEAKER_13]: There was no caveats to those statements.

381
00:44:53,242 --> 00:44:58,766
[SPEAKER_13]: There was no, well, we were going to pay you 75 but you didn't do this.

382
00:44:59,066 --> 00:45:03,210
[SPEAKER_13]: This was a no, we're not doing this sort of stuff and we have to change certain practices.

383
00:45:03,890 --> 00:45:05,451
[SPEAKER_13]: This is what started it all.

384
00:45:05,932 --> 00:45:11,056
[SPEAKER_13]: I understand some 8, 9, 10 months, however long down the road we are that Armstrong has changed their positions on that.

385
00:45:12,367 --> 00:45:16,269
[SPEAKER_13]: But that's what had happened in the beginning, and that's what started us where we get there.

386
00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:22,473
[SPEAKER_13]: So I feel it's important to start there and to understand what was told to us and to be clear about it.

387
00:45:23,993 --> 00:45:33,220
[SPEAKER_13]: The other aspects and the comments that I want to make, the true experts on our EMS systems are the fire chief and dispatcher Salve because he's in our dispatch center every single day.

388
00:45:33,861 --> 00:45:35,202
[SPEAKER_13]: But I want to add a couple of comments.

389
00:45:35,742 --> 00:45:38,024
[SPEAKER_13]: The city is safe regardless of what we do.

390
00:45:38,384 --> 00:45:40,086
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been doing this for a long time.

391
00:45:40,126 --> 00:45:41,226
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been chief of police.

392
00:45:41,267 --> 00:45:42,227
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm in my eighth year here.

393
00:45:42,908 --> 00:45:45,730
[SPEAKER_13]: The city is safe regardless of who we use for a service.

394
00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:47,812
[SPEAKER_13]: In this case, it's either Armstrong or Cataldo.

395
00:45:47,832 --> 00:45:52,715
[SPEAKER_13]: But by transitioning to Cataldo, or as I think Councilor Callahan asked the question,

396
00:45:53,556 --> 00:45:58,779
[SPEAKER_13]: Is the simple transaction of changing EMS services a danger to the city?

397
00:45:58,919 --> 00:45:59,379
[SPEAKER_13]: It is not.

398
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:04,402
[SPEAKER_13]: Cataldo is a legitimate EMS provider.

399
00:46:04,922 --> 00:46:09,405
[SPEAKER_13]: They work in the city of Lynn, Revere, Everett, Chelsea, Malden, Somerville.

400
00:46:09,985 --> 00:46:11,806
[SPEAKER_13]: I've spoken with those chiefs of polices.

401
00:46:13,106 --> 00:46:21,171
[SPEAKER_13]: They all have, they've expressed zero problems with Cataldo and they believe that they are a legitimate

402
00:46:22,385 --> 00:46:23,365
[SPEAKER_13]: responsible company.

403
00:46:24,286 --> 00:46:38,991
[SPEAKER_13]: And so from that point in time, I can tell you that the city is safe and the transition, moving from one company to the other, in this case, is not going to cause a public safety problem, if I understood that question from Councilor Callahan to be that.

404
00:46:39,631 --> 00:46:46,174
[SPEAKER_13]: So unless there's questions for me specifically, I'm going to turn it over to Chief Evans so he can get into more of the

405
00:46:48,037 --> 00:46:52,821
[SPEAKER_13]: nitty-gritty of the EMS system and the city of Medford and the issues that we may have had with Armstrong.

406
00:46:53,081 --> 00:46:56,024
[SPEAKER_13]: But I just wanted to stop by there to say where we stand and where we go.

407
00:46:56,884 --> 00:46:57,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

408
00:46:58,406 --> 00:46:59,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli.

409
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:12,397
[SPEAKER_09]: Chief, when we talked, the comment that the changeover is going to be some risk and it does, that it's going to fall back anyway if something happens on who?

410
00:47:13,418 --> 00:47:15,520
[SPEAKER_09]: On the chiefs, not the ambulance or the city?

411
00:47:16,163 --> 00:47:27,771
[SPEAKER_09]: We didn't, you didn't, we didn't talk and you didn't say that, George, you know, this isn't, this is something that the turnover is, is, is something we should be aware of.

412
00:47:27,931 --> 00:47:32,034
[SPEAKER_09]: This isn't something that, because what you just said is totally different what we talked about on the phone.

413
00:47:32,054 --> 00:47:34,756
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a little, this is one of the reasons why I brought this forward because.

414
00:47:35,436 --> 00:47:37,077
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not sure what you're asking, so that, that's.

415
00:47:37,318 --> 00:47:38,959
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so when we spoke.

416
00:47:38,979 --> 00:47:39,899
[SPEAKER_13]: Keep one mic, thanks.

417
00:47:40,099 --> 00:47:40,700
[SPEAKER_09]: When we spoke.

418
00:47:43,835 --> 00:48:02,350
[SPEAKER_09]: talked about the transition, that whenever there's a transition, that there is a level of, you know, flux where there's going to be some sort of, you know, there might be some issues, and that it's going to fall back on the chiefs, not anyone else.

419
00:48:09,418 --> 00:48:12,701
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, I just wanted to ask him if he had the conversation to clarify that.

420
00:48:12,741 --> 00:48:16,504
[SPEAKER_13]: I know we talked, I think, a couple of times that one day, and I know you talked to Chief Evans, but.

421
00:48:16,524 --> 00:48:19,987
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, no.

422
00:48:20,127 --> 00:48:28,074
[SPEAKER_13]: If you're asking or suggested to me that I told you that there would be a problem switching companies, or the simple transaction of switching companies.

423
00:48:28,094 --> 00:48:29,235
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I was under the impression that.

424
00:48:29,575 --> 00:48:30,416
[SPEAKER_09]: Would be problematic.

425
00:48:30,436 --> 00:48:33,158
[SPEAKER_09]: In the conversation, that I was under the impression when

426
00:48:34,112 --> 00:48:39,161
[SPEAKER_09]: whatever the turnaround is, whenever you change all the services, there is going to be a level of

427
00:48:40,193 --> 00:48:43,654
[SPEAKER_09]: of issues that I believe I said.

428
00:48:43,994 --> 00:48:44,814
[SPEAKER_09]: Not if it's said correctly.

429
00:48:44,894 --> 00:48:49,055
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't, I, I believe I said I don't want my daughter to be a guinea pig in this situation.

430
00:48:49,075 --> 00:48:50,335
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't, you know, that's.

431
00:48:50,775 --> 00:48:50,975
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

432
00:48:51,095 --> 00:48:54,256
[SPEAKER_13]: With apologies counsel, I don't remember it in those terms, but I will tell you that.

433
00:48:54,756 --> 00:49:03,978
[SPEAKER_05]: If we could just let me recognize folks before we get, I don't want, I think the more that we go back and forth and cutting each other's sentences off, the more likely we're going to get mad at each other.

434
00:49:04,738 --> 00:49:06,999
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you, Councilor Scarpelli, Chief Buckley.

435
00:49:08,815 --> 00:49:13,417
[SPEAKER_13]: So I don't remember it in those terms, Consul, and it's not to dodge the issue.

436
00:49:13,477 --> 00:49:14,158
[SPEAKER_13]: I will tell you this.

437
00:49:14,238 --> 00:49:19,601
[SPEAKER_13]: If done correctly, and if we do our jobs, there should not be a problem in a transaction, in a transition.

438
00:49:19,941 --> 00:49:24,603
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't think there's any situation or reason where I would say that to you.

439
00:49:25,163 --> 00:49:28,285
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why I asked the Chief if he had had the conversation with you.

440
00:49:28,305 --> 00:49:37,770
[SPEAKER_13]: It might have been a misunderstanding, but no, to the extent that transition from one company that is experienced and knows what they're doing is not an issue for us.

441
00:49:39,657 --> 00:49:43,339
[SPEAKER_13]: especially if the preparations which have gone into play are put in play.

442
00:49:44,999 --> 00:49:45,680
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli.

443
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:47,800
[SPEAKER_09]: If I can, Mr. President.

444
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:48,101
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

445
00:49:50,501 --> 00:49:54,303
[SPEAKER_09]: I know this is going to come out later, Chief, but it's a transition.

446
00:49:55,323 --> 00:50:02,146
[SPEAKER_09]: Has anyone worked with the leadership team from Armstrong to work with Cataldo in the city to transfer over?

447
00:50:02,366 --> 00:50:04,367
[SPEAKER_09]: Has anybody from the city worked with Cataldo?

448
00:50:05,227 --> 00:50:07,448
[SPEAKER_09]: Has anybody talked to Cataldo about the transition?

449
00:50:10,034 --> 00:50:10,274
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

450
00:50:10,755 --> 00:50:14,417
[SPEAKER_13]: Because they're working hand in hand with all the companies on the transition.

451
00:50:14,457 --> 00:50:15,478
[SPEAKER_13]: So they know more about that.

452
00:50:15,778 --> 00:50:21,762
[SPEAKER_13]: They're more appropriate to answer that.

453
00:50:21,902 --> 00:50:23,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

454
00:50:23,583 --> 00:50:25,765
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to let people go through their presentation as much as possible.

455
00:50:25,825 --> 00:50:30,848
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll go to Chief Evans and then Supervisor Salve.

456
00:50:30,868 --> 00:50:33,650
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we'll come back for questions after that.

457
00:50:34,110 --> 00:50:36,111
[SPEAKER_05]: Chief Evans.

458
00:50:36,392 --> 00:50:37,753
[SPEAKER_02]: Just basically to speak on.

459
00:50:38,929 --> 00:51:06,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Council Scarpelli mentioned that yeah, there's been communication with between Cataldo and Armstrong management about the transition date and they they agreed upon that so There will be a transition date of the the 19th Yeah, so Armstrong was involved with Cataldo and with the city yes for this transition in the 19th, yes, thank you I

460
00:51:10,493 --> 00:51:22,536
[SPEAKER_02]: So as Chief Buckley mentioned there before, that meeting occurred in his office back in March.

461
00:51:23,396 --> 00:51:33,758
[SPEAKER_02]: I had come over to that meeting also when Chief Buckley informed me that Armstrong had come over there to have the conversation with him about some of the things in the contract there.

462
00:51:33,778 --> 00:51:34,719
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was present for that.

463
00:51:37,106 --> 00:51:40,588
[SPEAKER_02]: that conversation did kind of, that surprised me.

464
00:51:41,288 --> 00:51:43,029
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't expecting that.

465
00:51:44,350 --> 00:52:05,642
[SPEAKER_02]: When Armstrong was bringing up the changes as far as the EMD thing, that's more for the dispatch, the funding for that, and also the transporting of first responders to the hospital, charges related to that, and conversation also came up about

466
00:52:06,975 --> 00:52:09,696
[SPEAKER_02]: possible EMT training for other fire departments.

467
00:52:11,237 --> 00:52:21,883
[SPEAKER_02]: But that conversation went as Armstrong saying that they wouldn't be able to basically train Medford firefighters to EMT.

468
00:52:24,004 --> 00:52:28,066
[SPEAKER_02]: And later on after conversations between

469
00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:40,492
[SPEAKER_02]: panned out later on, that turned into Armstrong telling us later after they had learned about Cataldo making an offer for that that they would be able to do EMT training for firefighters.

470
00:52:40,512 --> 00:52:53,415
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would be one of the additional things in the new contract with Armstrong and Cataldo switching would be firefighters getting EMT level training.

471
00:52:58,843 --> 00:53:02,708
[SPEAKER_02]: Chief of Staff mentioned the report issues that we had encountered.

472
00:53:04,590 --> 00:53:12,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Going back to January, asking for daily reports, there was a transition, I guess,

473
00:53:14,262 --> 00:53:19,664
[SPEAKER_02]: that Armstrong was transitioning to something with their reporting system.

474
00:53:19,864 --> 00:53:23,806
[SPEAKER_02]: So they were telling me that they couldn't get me the daily reports at that time.

475
00:53:24,426 --> 00:53:27,527
[SPEAKER_02]: They were telling me that they were going to be able to get me daily reports that were more accurate.

476
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:29,628
[SPEAKER_02]: They were switching over their system.

477
00:53:30,528 --> 00:53:33,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Prior to that, I had probably only gotten like one.

478
00:53:34,549 --> 00:53:41,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in June of 24, I got like a monthly report on their old system that showed me a general

479
00:53:42,627 --> 00:53:49,131
[SPEAKER_02]: idea of responses overall, it wasn't like a detailed report of response times or anything like that.

480
00:53:49,191 --> 00:54:00,337
[SPEAKER_02]: So it wasn't until April of 25 where I started getting detailed daily reports from Armstrong about response times.

481
00:54:01,197 --> 00:54:03,299
[SPEAKER_02]: And so since then,

482
00:54:04,962 --> 00:54:07,144
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been able to provide me those mostly.

483
00:54:07,724 --> 00:54:18,392
[SPEAKER_02]: There have been some recent challenges with that also where that system was apparently down for close to a month maybe where I wasn't able to get daily reports also.

484
00:54:19,353 --> 00:54:30,081
[SPEAKER_02]: So there have been some questions along the way of the response times from those daily reports

485
00:54:32,301 --> 00:54:36,304
[SPEAKER_02]: up with our response times also from our dispatch center.

486
00:54:37,105 --> 00:54:56,002
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was having one of my personnel look into some of the reporting and kind of taking some samples of the daily reports and looking through those and he was reporting back to me that he thought that there might have been some inconsistencies with the timelines

487
00:54:57,446 --> 00:55:16,616
[SPEAKER_02]: when we had dispatched to the calls Armstrong has also dispatched at the same time on the radio from dispatch here and we should be responding at the same time and getting on scene fairly quickly within a close time frame together.

488
00:55:16,796 --> 00:55:25,681
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of those reports were appearing to be like inconsistent with say like,

489
00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:35,315
[SPEAKER_02]: Armstrong might have been reporting like transferring a truck to another truck and some of the times were kind of off.

490
00:55:35,895 --> 00:55:36,936
[SPEAKER_02]: They weren't lining up.

491
00:55:38,116 --> 00:55:39,157
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were looking into that.

492
00:55:39,897 --> 00:55:42,318
[SPEAKER_02]: And there have been issues along the way also.

493
00:55:42,779 --> 00:55:51,163
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean it's going to happen with any company that there's going to be delays sometimes when they get, they have a lot of 9-1-1 contracts.

494
00:55:51,323 --> 00:55:54,945
[SPEAKER_02]: They have 9-1-1 contracts besides Medford and they end up

495
00:55:55,628 --> 00:56:02,691
[SPEAKER_02]: being on mutual aid in other cities and they get tied up and Medford gets pretty busy sometimes.

496
00:56:04,372 --> 00:56:07,934
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's going to be delays sometimes.

497
00:56:07,974 --> 00:56:16,318
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've questioned Armstrong on those delays and some of these reports that I have where

498
00:56:17,763 --> 00:56:19,464
[SPEAKER_02]: emailed them and questioned that.

499
00:56:19,524 --> 00:56:25,529
[SPEAKER_02]: They've kind of just said that they were going to look into the crew and get back to me, but I haven't heard back on that stuff.

500
00:56:27,270 --> 00:56:41,521
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just kind of between the surprising meeting in March and some of these inconsistencies with the reports, it's kind of just made me question,

501
00:56:43,717 --> 00:56:47,818
[SPEAKER_02]: if I'm able to trust what I'm getting as far as the reporting goes.

502
00:56:49,138 --> 00:57:11,603
[SPEAKER_02]: So that, I was taken aback by that because as you've stated that Armstrong's been there a long time and we've worked with Armstrong for a long time and, you know, I just, that's all I wanted was, you know, them to be transparent with me and make sure that they would get me all the accurate numbers and response times and some

503
00:57:12,426 --> 00:57:24,774
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when some of those response times were showing 14 minutes, 15 minutes, 23 minutes, 45 minute incidents, that was concerning.

504
00:57:25,234 --> 00:57:39,724
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, I've had several reports that I've gone through and kind of highlighted some of the calls and questioned them on the calls and there continues to be questions about that.

505
00:57:43,533 --> 00:57:54,035
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, I've spoken with Cataldo and they've already, you know, brought up the EMT training.

506
00:57:54,055 --> 00:58:06,398
[SPEAKER_02]: They've offered rehabilitation at fire scenes with extra equipment and things like that at the fire scenes.

507
00:58:07,518 --> 00:58:11,119
[SPEAKER_02]: They've already offered up several great ideas

508
00:58:12,102 --> 00:58:16,727
[SPEAKER_02]: new training opportunities and putting on training events.

509
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:31,624
[SPEAKER_02]: And right now, I don't see any reason to doubt that Cataldo says that they are capable of

510
00:58:32,605 --> 00:58:54,852
[SPEAKER_02]: working in Medford and handling Medford, and they have contracts with Somerville and Malden and Revere, Everett, all these communities next to us, which could potentially, you know, whereas we're so close to Somerville, Somerville and Medford could play off of that, having those

511
00:58:56,160 --> 00:59:14,696
[SPEAKER_02]: companies working together in both cities, just as Armstrong kind of played with Medford vehicles going to Arlington and Medford, you know, having Stoneham right there as a contract, they were kind of playing Medford off as like a hub for those other communities also.

512
00:59:15,496 --> 00:59:24,163
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it can be beneficial for having the cities right next door that are,

513
00:59:25,177 --> 00:59:26,398
[SPEAKER_02]: sharing the same companies.

514
00:59:26,518 --> 00:59:31,000
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

515
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:32,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you Chief.

516
00:59:32,021 --> 00:59:35,202
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll go to Councilor Scarpelli then Councilor Malauulu and then Councilor Leming.

517
00:59:35,222 --> 00:59:36,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli.

518
00:59:37,684 --> 00:59:39,445
[SPEAKER_09]: During the negotiations Chief at any time.

519
00:59:40,679 --> 00:59:45,620
[SPEAKER_09]: where these issues brought forward the negotiating team because you weren't actually part of the negotiations.

520
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:50,962
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that you, we talked about it was a wish list and then KP Law and then a city solicitor did that.

521
00:59:50,982 --> 00:59:55,803
[SPEAKER_09]: But there was no, nothing given to Armstrong because that was one of the questions I asked them.

522
00:59:56,143 --> 00:59:58,784
[SPEAKER_09]: Were there questions on during negotiations?

523
00:59:59,044 --> 01:00:00,685
[SPEAKER_09]: And they said no.

524
01:00:00,885 --> 01:00:01,645
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're lying.

525
01:00:02,459 --> 01:00:22,450
[SPEAKER_02]: We had the back and forth, like sometimes myself and the Chief were talking to them or something like that and discussing some of the issues that we had previously discussed in the Chief Buckley's office there with Armstrong again, but a lot of that other stuff, the financial stuff and stuff that was going on with lawyers that wasn't on.

526
01:00:23,070 --> 01:00:25,692
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but wouldn't that be part of the negotiation, say, hey, listen,

527
01:00:26,605 --> 01:00:29,466
[SPEAKER_09]: What we're talking about is the lack of response time.

528
01:00:29,886 --> 01:00:33,847
[SPEAKER_09]: We've identified these being concerns and you haven't followed through.

529
01:00:34,628 --> 01:00:35,368
[SPEAKER_09]: What would you do?

530
01:00:35,608 --> 01:00:39,970
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you said when you talked to Cataldo, Cataldo reassured you that that's not going to happen.

531
01:00:40,890 --> 01:00:42,050
[SPEAKER_09]: But you didn't do that there.

532
01:00:42,110 --> 01:00:50,153
[SPEAKER_09]: This is what, this is why, these are the questions why I brought up what you guys said and what I talked to Armstrong and the response times.

533
01:00:50,173 --> 01:00:51,173
[SPEAKER_09]: They were very forthcoming.

534
01:00:51,213 --> 01:00:52,614
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe they gave me,

535
01:00:53,855 --> 01:00:59,500
[SPEAKER_09]: They'll share tonight, I believe, because they shared it with me, the questions about response time, because I think that's one of the key pieces here.

536
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:00,721
[SPEAKER_09]: Are we safe?

537
01:01:01,501 --> 01:01:09,127
[SPEAKER_09]: And what we're seeing, what they have on the national, what's required by the state, and the information that they gave us through the state.

538
01:01:12,021 --> 01:01:19,647
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not saying anything that you're doing illegal, but is it possible that they could fudge a number that the state sees on a runtime?

539
01:01:20,508 --> 01:01:24,110
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that's what they, that's what I can, I can share with this to the council.

540
01:01:24,511 --> 01:01:25,631
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what they've shared with us.

541
01:01:26,372 --> 01:01:38,301
[SPEAKER_09]: So if that's different, I need to know if our, if our 911 center is saying that these numbers are off, this is alarming if this is going to the state in response times and there's, there's a misunderstanding.

542
01:01:38,321 --> 01:01:39,922
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this is a bigger concerning issue.

543
01:01:39,982 --> 01:01:40,903
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um,

544
01:01:41,779 --> 01:01:44,821
[SPEAKER_09]: That to me is going to be, I'd like to hear what Armstrong has to say.

545
01:01:44,841 --> 01:01:54,887
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the last piece, I know that the Chief of Staff explained the situation with our ambulance, specifically in Arlington.

546
01:01:55,367 --> 01:01:58,269
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that was something that was brought up with Armstrong.

547
01:01:58,309 --> 01:02:00,130
[SPEAKER_09]: And I said, explain this.

548
01:02:00,190 --> 01:02:05,893
[SPEAKER_09]: And they said, well, when we first started the contract, Medford was adamant to have Medford on an ambulance.

549
01:02:06,874 --> 01:02:09,896
[SPEAKER_09]: But by law, mutual aid

550
01:02:10,862 --> 01:02:17,405
[SPEAKER_09]: If a neighbor community needs an ambulance, Mutual Aid, the closest ambulance, has to respond to that community, correct?

551
01:02:18,585 --> 01:02:18,905
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

552
01:02:18,965 --> 01:02:19,265
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

553
01:02:19,926 --> 01:02:31,250
[SPEAKER_09]: So if it happens to be the Medford ambulance that goes to respond to Arlington, and they're in Arlington, what I asked Armstrong, does that leave a gap here?

554
01:02:31,470 --> 01:02:32,451
[SPEAKER_09]: And they said, absolutely not.

555
01:02:32,891 --> 01:02:38,473
[SPEAKER_09]: We just shift our ambulance services from the neighboring communities to make sure Medford is always covered.

556
01:02:39,309 --> 01:02:53,818
[SPEAKER_09]: And they also shared that that's by law, that's not, that's not something that they do out of because the nice guys by law, it doesn't matter if there's an ambulance, the closest ambulance from what I've been told in the mutual aid process that that has to go there.

557
01:02:54,318 --> 01:03:05,625
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's a concern when the chief of staff says one of the concerns is we often that are responders said we often had our ambulance in Arlington

558
01:03:06,976 --> 01:03:09,237
[SPEAKER_09]: It's making it sound that Medford wasn't covered at the time.

559
01:03:09,277 --> 01:03:10,017
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that what we're saying?

560
01:03:11,017 --> 01:03:21,341
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, it's possible that over the years that as Armstrong picked up more and more 9-1-1 contracts, perhaps they kind of spread themselves out too thinly.

561
01:03:22,601 --> 01:03:33,445
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, maybe, yeah, I don't know if they have a contract with Arlington or not specifically, but they probably could have, if they have a contract with Arlington, probably,

562
01:03:35,373 --> 01:03:45,198
[SPEAKER_02]: buy more ambulances and make more staffing available to Arlington so that Medford consistently has ambulances always dedicated in Medford.

563
01:03:46,859 --> 01:03:47,900
[SPEAKER_09]: If I can, Mr. President.

564
01:03:50,001 --> 01:03:57,825
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, and I understand that, but as it was explained to me, that if there are shifts in different communities, ambulances have to move where it's needed.

565
01:03:58,365 --> 01:04:01,867
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't matter if it's Armstrong, if it's Brewster, if it's whoever it may be.

566
01:04:02,468 --> 01:04:04,729
[SPEAKER_09]: If it's Winchester Fire, whoever's closest.

567
01:04:05,405 --> 01:04:14,753
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I think it's going to be interesting when Armstrong comes up to ask them how many times we used mutual aid, they had to use mutual aid, and that method was left uncovered.

568
01:04:14,773 --> 01:04:15,934
[SPEAKER_09]: That's going to be clear.

569
01:04:16,034 --> 01:04:24,401
[SPEAKER_09]: That's going to be something that I hope Armstrong has to answer because that's going to be a very telling point that, because making it sound that,

570
01:04:25,549 --> 01:04:28,831
[SPEAKER_09]: Our city hasn't been covered by Armstrong, but I'm just taking for what you're saying.

571
01:04:28,851 --> 01:04:32,994
[SPEAKER_09]: You're saying that at times, if they're spreading it too thin, maybe they need to get more ambulances.

572
01:04:33,334 --> 01:04:36,536
[SPEAKER_09]: That leaves me a little fearful that that's why I'm having this meeting.

573
01:04:36,917 --> 01:04:39,338
[SPEAKER_09]: Because if that's what we're leading to, that's pretty alarming.

574
01:04:39,779 --> 01:04:40,739
[SPEAKER_09]: So, and I appreciate that.

575
01:04:41,580 --> 01:04:43,121
[SPEAKER_09]: So, thank you, Mr. President.

576
01:04:43,721 --> 01:04:44,862
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

577
01:04:46,703 --> 01:04:52,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Would the Chief of Staff like to, Madam Chief of Staff, and then we're going to go to the other councilors who have questions.

578
01:04:52,442 --> 01:04:53,442
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, President Bears.

579
01:04:53,542 --> 01:05:00,984
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to see if we could have Supervisor Salve come up and touch on some of these issues with Arlington, because I know we have specific data points.

580
01:05:01,544 --> 01:05:10,726
[SPEAKER_14]: And then I also would like to ask at the right timing, President Bears, for Chief Evans to specifically identify some of the data points that he's been reviewing.

581
01:05:10,746 --> 01:05:17,008
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a lot of data, and we don't have it all culled out at this point, but there was enough inconsistencies.

582
01:05:17,028 --> 01:05:19,248
[SPEAKER_14]: Like I said, once trust is broken, trust is broken.

583
01:05:20,129 --> 01:05:21,989
[SPEAKER_14]: So, Supervisor Salve?

584
01:05:23,926 --> 01:05:33,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, just really quickly, Supervisor, Councilor Leming, Councilor Mullane, do you have questions specifically around response times, data, coverage that you want to add before we go back?

585
01:05:34,657 --> 01:05:38,040
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems like a yes from both of you, Councilor Mullane and then Councilor Leming.

586
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:39,340
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

587
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:42,703
[SPEAKER_21]: And thank you, everyone, for coming up and sharing some of this feedback.

588
01:05:43,123 --> 01:05:45,185
[SPEAKER_21]: I just wanted to get a couple of clarifying questions.

589
01:05:45,225 --> 01:05:51,611
[SPEAKER_21]: So all of this really seemed to transpire or start to break down in March of 2025.

590
01:05:51,671 --> 01:06:02,199
[SPEAKER_21]: So previous to this, all the other times and conversations you've had, you felt comfortable with where the contract was, but were surprised at that March meeting of some of the changes that had occurred.

591
01:06:05,072 --> 01:06:16,117
[SPEAKER_14]: I welcome, you know, the individuals who are involved in these, but my best understanding to sum it up at a high level would be the issues that were identified prior to March of 2025 were issues that were being handled internally.

592
01:06:16,137 --> 01:06:16,597
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

593
01:06:16,637 --> 01:06:28,183
[SPEAKER_14]: We, we had concerns with them and we were addressing them and we were asking questions, but the March of 2025 was a bit of a breaking point for the city with regard to the types of things that Armstrong was reneging on.

594
01:06:29,023 --> 01:06:32,904
[SPEAKER_14]: that changed entirely the tone of the direction, I think, that this went in.

595
01:06:33,304 --> 01:06:53,531
[SPEAKER_14]: Then Armstrong was given an opportunity to have those good faith discussions and negotiate with the city and provide or address that unfortunate meeting and discussion where they attempted to not stand on the grounds of the contract, but they still didn't do those things subsequently.

596
01:06:53,631 --> 01:06:57,512
[SPEAKER_14]: So there were a couple different opportunities here for Armstrong, but they failed to do so.

597
01:06:58,969 --> 01:06:59,929
[SPEAKER_05]: And then.

598
01:06:59,949 --> 01:07:00,230
[SPEAKER_05]: One second.

599
01:07:00,510 --> 01:07:01,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.

600
01:07:01,430 --> 01:07:01,850
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh sorry.

601
01:07:01,870 --> 01:07:02,651
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

602
01:07:03,251 --> 01:07:16,257
[SPEAKER_21]: So it seemed like at that meeting at that point in time the main things that kind of fell to the wayside or what they pulled back on was around the reimbursements the transports for first responders and the EMT training.

603
01:07:16,557 --> 01:07:23,580
[SPEAKER_21]: And then after having the conversation with them you shared that those are three things or those are the kind of the biggest issues.

604
01:07:24,151 --> 01:07:29,475
[SPEAKER_21]: and Cataldo was able to do the EMT training and they came back and said, oh, we can do that piece too.

605
01:07:29,515 --> 01:07:33,859
[SPEAKER_21]: Do they say anything about those other pieces that were missing from the contract previously?

606
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:40,744
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't want to answer this question fully myself because I think others are probably best to answer this, but I don't think it was that linear.

607
01:07:41,565 --> 01:07:45,528
[SPEAKER_14]: There was four, if we were to quantify it, I think there were four specific things.

608
01:07:45,989 --> 01:07:47,890
[SPEAKER_14]: There was the reimbursements that were due to the city.

609
01:07:48,270 --> 01:07:48,791
[SPEAKER_14]: There was the...

610
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:55,202
[SPEAKER_14]: The fact that they were looking to charge the city, no charges ever existed previously.

611
01:07:55,222 --> 01:07:56,462
[SPEAKER_14]: It wasn't a part of the contract.

612
01:07:56,582 --> 01:07:59,503
[SPEAKER_14]: Mid-contract, they're looking to charge the city for EMD services.

613
01:08:00,664 --> 01:08:18,250
[SPEAKER_14]: The fact that they're looking to change dispatch for public safety personnel who are injured in the line of duty, and also that they were not prepared to offer any training to city firefighters, which just seems like a no-brainer to support the city in a partnership to me.

614
01:08:19,831 --> 01:08:23,954
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think after that, then there was a negotiation process.

615
01:08:23,974 --> 01:08:32,000
[SPEAKER_14]: So yeah, I think that the part that I'm specifically stating is not linear is there's a number of different conversations occurring back and forth.

616
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:33,662
[SPEAKER_14]: And there was no void in conversations.

617
01:08:34,082 --> 01:08:37,565
[SPEAKER_14]: There was communications with Armstrong on a regular basis.

618
01:08:38,805 --> 01:08:46,129
[SPEAKER_14]: Anytime there was a discussion, there was a request, there was communications or requests by Armstrong to speak, they always spoke with the chiefs is my understanding.

619
01:08:46,149 --> 01:08:51,552
[SPEAKER_14]: And there was an open line of communication, but the chiefs can say it or speak to it themselves.

620
01:08:59,366 --> 01:09:09,688
[SPEAKER_21]: After that piece of it, in March, in April, is when you started talking about the response times and following up on whether or not those were actually lining up with what you were seeing.

621
01:09:10,048 --> 01:09:12,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's when we were finally getting the daily reports in April.

622
01:09:13,328 --> 01:09:13,588
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

623
01:09:14,249 --> 01:09:14,489
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

624
01:09:14,509 --> 01:09:15,229
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

625
01:09:15,969 --> 01:09:18,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Leming on the coverage and the response times?

626
01:09:20,270 --> 01:09:21,070
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

627
01:09:21,750 --> 01:09:28,651
[SPEAKER_11]: How, can you talk about, you said that there are discrepancies between what your team found and what was,

628
01:09:29,482 --> 01:09:30,563
[SPEAKER_11]: in the reports.

629
01:09:31,903 --> 01:09:34,124
[SPEAKER_11]: What was the nature of those discrepancies?

630
01:09:34,164 --> 01:09:39,106
[SPEAKER_11]: Was it like the reports were saying it was five minutes, but it was actually six minutes?

631
01:09:39,907 --> 01:09:46,070
[SPEAKER_11]: Or was it like the reports were saying a response time was five minutes, but you found out it was closer to 20 minutes?

632
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:55,434
[SPEAKER_11]: So just how, like, just a ballpark average of, like, what you're seeing, and how consistent was that over the reports that you're?

633
01:09:55,574 --> 01:10:06,979
[SPEAKER_02]: It could have been, like, anywhere from a minute, a couple minutes, or a few minutes, or it wasn't, like, as high as, like, the 15 minutes, like, obvious, like, something like that all the time.

634
01:10:07,519 --> 01:10:16,963
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just kind of a discrepancy between when we're dispatched and when they possibly, like, when the

635
01:10:17,325 --> 01:10:35,136
[SPEAKER_02]: response time is maybe calculated, maybe when it's coming through Armstrong's EMD or something like that, maybe they're calculating that response time from that end of it instead of when they're actually dispatched at the same time as we are.

636
01:10:35,817 --> 01:10:46,083
[SPEAKER_02]: So it might be a couple minutes, it might be a few minutes, but it kind of affects like the averages that are

637
01:10:47,074 --> 01:10:47,435
[SPEAKER_02]: in the reports.

638
01:10:47,455 --> 01:10:51,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to further clarify, what are the data sources that we're comparing here?

639
01:10:51,478 --> 01:11:03,367
[SPEAKER_02]: So daily reports from Armstrong Ambulance, which shows response times and on scene times and transport times and things like that.

640
01:11:03,387 --> 01:11:03,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

641
01:11:03,928 --> 01:11:05,849
[SPEAKER_05]: And then compared to, where's the city side?

642
01:11:06,129 --> 01:11:07,991
[SPEAKER_05]: What data were you generating on the city side?

643
01:11:08,111 --> 01:11:12,815
[SPEAKER_05]: So where the dispatchers, where they have their

644
01:11:14,154 --> 01:11:29,355
[SPEAKER_02]: computer-aided dispatch system where they have their dispatch times and response times and on-scene times on their end, so that they're exactly when they're inputting the time that they

645
01:11:30,317 --> 01:11:41,400
[SPEAKER_02]: They receive the call and when they put that call out over the airwaves and communicate that call to the fire department and Armstrong.

646
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:50,862
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's the daily reports from Armstrong that they're generating and then the reports from the 911 dispatch system and it sounded to me like you were saying that maybe the,

647
01:11:52,342 --> 01:11:59,183
[SPEAKER_05]: there was something where Armstrong's calculating that based on when their EMD dispatch gets it versus when the 911 goes out?

648
01:11:59,483 --> 01:12:02,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it might be something as far, as much as that.

649
01:12:03,184 --> 01:12:12,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Possibly, I'm not sure if they're going by their actual, like their EMD time because they have their own dispatch center.

650
01:12:12,886 --> 01:12:13,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

651
01:12:14,067 --> 01:12:19,208
[SPEAKER_02]: So when the EMD call comes to dispatch, they answer the phone and they now,

652
01:12:21,654 --> 01:12:25,315
[SPEAKER_02]: connect that person to Armstrong's dispatch center.

653
01:12:25,495 --> 01:12:25,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

654
01:12:25,955 --> 01:12:39,120
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that person tells Armstrong what their medical issue is and as Armstrong is speaking to that person, they might be actually talking them through like CPI or something.

655
01:12:39,140 --> 01:12:49,423
[SPEAKER_02]: They're kind of figuring out what this medical issue is and they might be talking them through somebody, they might be talking to somebody on that phone like instructing them on how

656
01:12:50,142 --> 01:13:00,144
[SPEAKER_02]: to perform CPR on somebody or they might be evaluating that call to see if it requires ALS versus BLS.

657
01:13:00,264 --> 01:13:13,147
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they're communicating that to their employees on their Armstrong radio as our dispatchers are now coming over the air and dispatching the closest,

658
01:13:15,053 --> 01:13:20,675
[SPEAKER_02]: fire truck and then they're coming over the airwaves also calling for the Armstrong Ambulance.

659
01:13:20,695 --> 01:13:24,196
[SPEAKER_02]: So Armstrong Ambulance at the time is kind of hearing it on both radios.

660
01:13:24,216 --> 01:13:28,017
[SPEAKER_02]: They're hearing it on Medford fire frequency and Armstrong's frequencies.

661
01:13:29,458 --> 01:13:29,638
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

662
01:13:29,838 --> 01:13:30,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Just really quickly sorry.

663
01:13:31,058 --> 01:13:32,019
[SPEAKER_05]: Just so I understand it.

664
01:13:32,779 --> 01:13:35,960
[SPEAKER_05]: So someone calls number one number one dispatch picks up.

665
01:13:36,580 --> 01:13:37,600
[SPEAKER_05]: They figure out what it is.

666
01:13:38,281 --> 01:13:39,461
[SPEAKER_05]: They put something out over there.

667
01:13:39,541 --> 01:13:42,122
[SPEAKER_05]: Then police and fire respond there and that's when the

668
01:13:43,059 --> 01:13:56,048
[SPEAKER_05]: the Armstrong people here for the first time, and then our 911 dispatcher connects to the EMD, and then they start talking to whoever's made the call and also dispatching their trucks.

669
01:13:56,848 --> 01:14:00,451
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they might be like assessing it on the EMD end.

670
01:14:00,771 --> 01:14:00,971
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

671
01:14:02,052 --> 01:14:06,915
[SPEAKER_02]: As dispatchers saying, you know, for instance, say engine one and A1.

672
01:14:07,396 --> 01:14:07,556
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

673
01:14:07,596 --> 01:14:09,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kind of throwing that out there, engine one, A1.

674
01:14:10,087 --> 01:14:18,171
[SPEAKER_02]: You're responding to the scene, and as that's happening, there's somebody on the EMD connection at Armstrong also.

675
01:14:18,191 --> 01:14:18,531
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.

676
01:14:18,551 --> 01:14:22,573
[SPEAKER_05]: There's kind of an extra step in there where R911 sends it to them.

677
01:14:22,793 --> 01:14:23,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

678
01:14:23,493 --> 01:14:31,457
[SPEAKER_05]: And just the other one thing I wanted to clarify from what you were saying, and then I do want to turn it back over to Councilor Levin because I've kind of hijacked this from him a little bit, and I apologize.

679
01:14:36,148 --> 01:14:38,329
[SPEAKER_05]: 30 seconds, a minute, a minute and a half, two minute differences.

680
01:14:38,429 --> 01:14:52,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Just from like a sampling of some of the things, he was kind of digging into it and it takes a lot of time to kind of dig into both, try to look at both things and try to sort through it all.

681
01:14:52,132 --> 01:15:05,416
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, but some of the, like also the daily reports from Armstrong have questioned as far as, it seems like a lot of the,

682
01:15:06,398 --> 01:15:26,513
[SPEAKER_02]: The patient refusal times, for some reason it looks like a lot of those appear to be that there could be 12, 13 minutes, 14 minutes response times there and then that doesn't get counted towards the actual response averages that Armstrong is reporting to us.

683
01:15:27,094 --> 01:15:35,520
[SPEAKER_02]: So that doesn't report in the column of the other responses that they're using for their average to go by.

684
01:15:36,175 --> 01:15:56,742
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's some calls like they might put in their transfer or they might write administrative on the report or it starts getting confusing with multiple trucks, Armstrong, different truck numbers and names that are reported line by line on the daily report where it might mention transfer this.

685
01:15:57,651 --> 01:16:01,213
[SPEAKER_02]: and transfer that and then the times are kind of skewed on the reporting.

686
01:16:01,914 --> 01:16:17,784
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's several instances on the daily reports where it's tough to follow along with the actual response times that they're reporting it versus what they're reporting as the average overall.

687
01:16:18,104 --> 01:16:20,866
[SPEAKER_02]: So it seems like there's some data missing there.

688
01:16:21,346 --> 01:16:21,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

689
01:16:21,546 --> 01:16:22,907
[SPEAKER_05]: I just had those clarifying questions.

690
01:16:22,927 --> 01:16:24,148
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll turn it back over to Councilor Leming.

691
01:16:24,634 --> 01:16:37,874
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so it sounds like some of the discrepancies might have been due to technical matters, the call being passed over to Armstrong after the 911 dispatchers got it.

692
01:16:39,897 --> 01:16:44,378
[SPEAKER_11]: What I was wondering was how the numbers are entered.

693
01:16:44,418 --> 01:16:50,720
[SPEAKER_11]: Are they entered by hand or are they caught by some, by an automatic system and then generated just purely by, with software?

694
01:16:50,740 --> 01:16:51,080
[SPEAKER_11]: And from.

695
01:16:58,322 --> 01:16:58,522
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

696
01:16:58,542 --> 01:17:14,093
[SPEAKER_11]: And so it sounds like from what you just said that a possible explanation for that is just that because their reports are generated with different means, that could explain the discrepancy going on there.

697
01:17:14,113 --> 01:17:18,156
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's not like some deliberate attempt to fudge the numbers on their end.

698
01:17:18,907 --> 01:17:19,987
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

699
01:17:21,027 --> 01:17:22,008
[SPEAKER_14]: May I just state something?

700
01:17:22,028 --> 01:17:23,608
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not going to be as nice as Chief Evans.

701
01:17:24,368 --> 01:17:28,589
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just going to restate something that Chief Evans has stated to me through you, President Bears, to the council.

702
01:17:29,689 --> 01:17:34,630
[SPEAKER_14]: Chief Evans has followed up with Armstrong on these types of questions, and the questions have gone into a black hole.

703
01:17:35,330 --> 01:17:39,551
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't know, we don't know why there was such a reporting gap.

704
01:17:39,591 --> 01:17:43,272
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't know why there was differences, but we don't get that information back from them.

705
01:17:44,652 --> 01:17:46,493
[SPEAKER_14]: Chief, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.

706
01:17:46,553 --> 01:17:48,974
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, I'm going to go to Councilor Scarpelli for the follow-up really quickly.

707
01:17:48,994 --> 01:17:49,814
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, I'm sorry.

708
01:17:50,094 --> 01:17:51,155
[SPEAKER_09]: I just, is that true?

709
01:17:51,795 --> 01:17:54,196
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that true you just, you're being too nice?

710
01:17:54,216 --> 01:17:54,996
[SPEAKER_09]: Because we've got to know.

711
01:17:55,416 --> 01:18:01,799
[SPEAKER_02]: No, so I've followed up and I've asked them on certain times when I come across longer times.

712
01:18:03,059 --> 01:18:23,052
[SPEAKER_02]: 8 minutes, 9 minutes, 10 minutes, 11 minutes, you know, more, anything more than that, you know, I'm asking them about that and kind of I get a response back that, oh, that's kind of weird that, you know, that was a long shoot time for that crew, we'll just talk to the crew and get back to you but I'm not hearing back on these items.

713
01:18:23,232 --> 01:18:26,434
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's been several,

714
01:18:27,608 --> 01:18:29,510
[SPEAKER_02]: inconsistencies with that as well, so.

715
01:18:30,370 --> 01:18:44,042
[SPEAKER_11]: And if I may, you also mentioned that they recently switched over their software because you previously were getting reports once a month in 2024 and then it switched over to daily, which you started getting in April, correct?

716
01:18:44,423 --> 01:18:44,563
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

717
01:18:45,884 --> 01:18:55,431
[SPEAKER_11]: So in my, in my mind it seems like a, and I, I do completely understand the point that the chief of staff is bringing, bringing up about emails going into a black hole.

718
01:18:55,471 --> 01:18:58,574
[SPEAKER_11]: It happens, happens to me in my day job a lot.

719
01:18:59,114 --> 01:19:07,301
[SPEAKER_11]: I fully, you know, I, I, I have sympathy with you know, folks that don't, don't respond to my, to my inquiries.

720
01:19:07,341 --> 01:19:08,402
[SPEAKER_11]: But it, it does sound like,

721
01:19:09,142 --> 01:19:11,944
[SPEAKER_11]: that could be a very likely explanation.

722
01:19:12,044 --> 01:19:16,908
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not necessarily a malfeasance on the part of the company.

723
01:19:17,469 --> 01:19:22,633
[SPEAKER_11]: But I imagine that Armstrong is going to also be talking later tonight.

724
01:19:22,673 --> 01:19:24,894
[SPEAKER_11]: They could offer some more insight there.

725
01:19:25,275 --> 01:19:27,957
[SPEAKER_11]: The other question that I had, which has been on my mind is,

726
01:19:29,798 --> 01:19:36,825
[SPEAKER_11]: It sounded like the March meeting with Chief Buckley, between him and Armstrong, obviously didn't go well.

727
01:19:37,505 --> 01:19:47,114
[SPEAKER_11]: And I have no doubt that some personnel from Armstrong said at that meeting that they wouldn't be paying back the city the $75,000 a year that they were owed over so many years.

728
01:19:53,440 --> 01:20:03,786
[SPEAKER_11]: The two questions that I have related to that were, what was the ostensible reason that they owed the city that much money?

729
01:20:04,046 --> 01:20:10,809
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilman Leming, can we come back to the payments after we talk about the coverage and the response times?

730
01:20:10,829 --> 01:20:11,950
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, sure.

731
01:20:11,970 --> 01:20:12,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

732
01:20:12,870 --> 01:20:13,071
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

733
01:20:13,851 --> 01:20:15,372
[SPEAKER_05]: We're talking about coverage and response times.

734
01:20:15,432 --> 01:20:17,353
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we have questions from councilors on that.

735
01:20:18,097 --> 01:20:20,379
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Supervisor Salve is itching to say something.

736
01:20:20,559 --> 01:20:26,925
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we want to talk a little bit more, it seems like we have questions about response times.

737
01:20:26,965 --> 01:20:33,011
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it's been said that there were, that trucks were in Arlington a lot, so there were coverage questions.

738
01:20:33,091 --> 01:20:36,755
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you want to talk about that a little more, and then we can come back on the payments question.

739
01:20:37,566 --> 01:20:40,588
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, Mike Salvia, the Supervisor for Communications.

740
01:20:41,348 --> 01:20:43,410
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you for having me.

741
01:20:43,990 --> 01:20:47,232
[SPEAKER_22]: I just wanna go back for two topics.

742
01:20:47,492 --> 01:20:51,715
[SPEAKER_22]: One was the 45-minute call, and I wanna talk a little bit more about EMD.

743
01:20:53,055 --> 01:21:00,460
[SPEAKER_22]: On the 45-minute call, Councilor Scapelli, you had stated that it's a 50-50 problem that Armstrong said.

744
01:21:02,701 --> 01:21:05,423
[SPEAKER_22]: In that call, I was actually in the room.

745
01:21:06,585 --> 01:21:13,170
[SPEAKER_22]: And at the time of the call, my fire dispatcher noticed that there was a problem with Armstrong in responding.

746
01:21:14,691 --> 01:21:22,096
[SPEAKER_22]: My dispatcher called over to Armstrong and he spoke to Bobby, who was awesome by the way, she's the best.

747
01:21:22,956 --> 01:21:28,420
[SPEAKER_22]: And he asked what was going on, if she needed assistance.

748
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:34,104
[SPEAKER_22]: Bobby had stated to my dispatcher that their GPS had failed.

749
01:21:34,948 --> 01:21:40,091
[SPEAKER_22]: So they can no longer see any of their ambulances in the field, that their GPS is failed.

750
01:21:40,752 --> 01:21:44,894
[SPEAKER_22]: So my dispatcher gave them the list of who's going where.

751
01:21:45,615 --> 01:21:51,158
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think what happened in that whole scenario is when their GPS failed, they lost track of their ambulances.

752
01:21:51,959 --> 01:21:55,241
[SPEAKER_22]: And in my opinion, that's what caused the 45 minute delay.

753
01:21:58,526 --> 01:22:02,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Was there anything else on the response times, data questions or coverage?

754
01:22:03,268 --> 01:22:05,409
[SPEAKER_22]: The data is very hard to understand.

755
01:22:05,429 --> 01:22:15,853
[SPEAKER_22]: In 2020, when I first came into MedFed, I used to receive data with Lieutenant Rudolph, who's recently retired a few years ago, and we would get a daily tracker.

756
01:22:16,373 --> 01:22:22,016
[SPEAKER_22]: So when they talk about software update or whatever, it's the same thing from 2020 to now.

757
01:22:22,456 --> 01:22:24,857
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't see any changes within their tracking system.

758
01:22:25,542 --> 01:22:40,651
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, they'll, if you have an ambulance that's assigned to the call, right, and then like Chief Evans has stated, you got, they may cancel the ambulance, reassign the ambulance, and then cancel the ambulance again.

759
01:22:41,011 --> 01:22:41,532
[SPEAKER_22]: And there's that.

760
01:22:42,252 --> 01:22:53,023
[SPEAKER_22]: there's that, within that reporting, there's no data or, you know, writing inside that to state where that ambulance went, was it reassigned or anything like that.

761
01:22:53,043 --> 01:22:57,528
[SPEAKER_22]: So we have a lot of blank within their own reporting.

762
01:22:58,970 --> 01:23:02,533
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, so on the EMD aspect of it,

763
01:23:03,599 --> 01:23:05,521
[SPEAKER_22]: We received a call, okay?

764
01:23:05,541 --> 01:23:07,562
[SPEAKER_22]: 911 was the location emergency.

765
01:23:07,582 --> 01:23:08,743
[SPEAKER_22]: They give us their address.

766
01:23:08,763 --> 01:23:12,326
[SPEAKER_22]: They say it's a medical aid, 123 Main Street or whatever, okay?

767
01:23:12,466 --> 01:23:15,228
[SPEAKER_22]: We get a brief nature of what's going on.

768
01:23:15,748 --> 01:23:17,410
[SPEAKER_22]: And then we tell the caller, stay on the line.

769
01:23:17,430 --> 01:23:18,630
[SPEAKER_22]: We're transferring the EMD.

770
01:23:19,331 --> 01:23:20,252
[SPEAKER_22]: They take the call.

771
01:23:20,992 --> 01:23:23,054
[SPEAKER_22]: Armstrong, it's Bedford.

772
01:23:23,254 --> 01:23:24,055
[SPEAKER_22]: Caller, go ahead.

773
01:23:25,075 --> 01:23:27,117
[SPEAKER_22]: That takes anywhere from 30 to 40 seconds within it.

774
01:23:29,297 --> 01:23:34,099
[SPEAKER_22]: The EMD is, and then a lot of times we'll sign a monitor.

775
01:23:34,740 --> 01:23:45,845
[SPEAKER_22]: Now, when we do get a call from medicals, it's not just life threatening, it's every single medical is transferred into that EMD, Armstrong EMD.

776
01:23:47,286 --> 01:23:56,051
[SPEAKER_22]: And going back a little here, when the meeting was stated that Armstrong's no longer gonna be doing EMD,

777
01:23:58,018 --> 01:24:08,243
[SPEAKER_22]: To me, that's a shock, because if a provider's not gonna do EMD anymore, the city of Medford, we would need three or four additional staff to support that EMD.

778
01:24:09,823 --> 01:24:20,968
[SPEAKER_22]: So I don't know why that was said, or it's just, I don't, I mean, that's a shock to me, being in this field, so I just, interesting.

779
01:24:22,889 --> 01:24:26,791
[SPEAKER_22]: As for Arlington, there's a lot of talk about Arlington here.

780
01:24:30,162 --> 01:24:35,288
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm not sure why the problem was never fixed between Armstrong and Arlington and ourselves.

781
01:24:36,849 --> 01:24:45,578
[SPEAKER_22]: We are forever, and I get the whole mutual aid thing, OEMS, they have guidelines, they have zoning, it's called zoning, and every zone has to take care of each other.

782
01:24:46,462 --> 01:24:59,191
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't understand the fact that why we can go into a city 6 to 10 times per day, a town, whatever you want to call it, 6 to 10 times per day on an ALS call.

783
01:25:00,172 --> 01:25:05,956
[SPEAKER_22]: Now, there's a basic life support ambulance and there's also an ALS unit, which is advanced life support.

784
01:25:08,545 --> 01:25:11,647
[SPEAKER_22]: 90% of that time, we hardly ever send a BLS over to Arlington.

785
01:25:11,707 --> 01:25:16,349
[SPEAKER_22]: We are always sending our advanced life support ambulance over to Arlington.

786
01:25:17,269 --> 01:25:21,591
[SPEAKER_22]: Now, I believe Arlington does not have that capability.

787
01:25:22,071 --> 01:25:31,175
[SPEAKER_22]: And if Armstrong has a contract with Arlington or Handshake, then why are they not adding more resources to Arlington?

788
01:25:31,555 --> 01:25:35,537
[SPEAKER_22]: Instead of taking from Medford all the time, taking from Stoneham all the time,

789
01:25:36,037 --> 01:25:38,078
[SPEAKER_22]: or whatever other resource they have.

790
01:25:38,678 --> 01:25:39,198
[SPEAKER_22]: And they're right.

791
01:25:39,238 --> 01:25:41,439
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, ambulances go all over the Commonwealth.

792
01:25:41,799 --> 01:25:44,260
[SPEAKER_22]: The ambulance companies are supporting each other.

793
01:25:44,660 --> 01:25:45,961
[SPEAKER_22]: That's their job.

794
01:25:46,001 --> 01:25:47,081
[SPEAKER_22]: That's what they're supposed to do.

795
01:25:47,521 --> 01:25:56,285
[SPEAKER_22]: But I'll never understand why we take our resources to other cities that probably should have been fixed a long time ago.

796
01:25:57,965 --> 01:26:02,247
[SPEAKER_22]: And I just don't understand if anybody has any questions for me.

797
01:26:03,967 --> 01:26:09,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli, and then once we've kind of gone through this coverage question, we'll come back to the payments.

798
01:26:09,350 --> 01:26:10,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli.

799
01:26:10,591 --> 01:26:11,311
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

800
01:26:11,391 --> 01:26:21,037
[SPEAKER_09]: So it sounds like you're saying that because they're doing this, they're leaving the city of Medford vulnerable without required

801
01:26:22,835 --> 01:26:23,295
[SPEAKER_09]: Ambulances?

802
01:26:23,536 --> 01:26:34,365
[SPEAKER_22]: I didn't say, I didn't say vulnerable or what's happening is, say if we said, like I had a, we had an incident one where A1 and A2 went out of the city.

803
01:26:34,405 --> 01:26:35,886
[SPEAKER_22]: Those are both our ALSs.

804
01:26:36,347 --> 01:26:37,668
[SPEAKER_22]: Went out of the city to Medford.

805
01:26:38,028 --> 01:26:38,188
Right.

806
01:26:38,348 --> 01:26:38,649
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

807
01:26:39,169 --> 01:26:40,810
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean outside of the city too.

808
01:26:41,091 --> 01:26:42,392
[SPEAKER_22]: I believe both were Arlington.

809
01:26:43,224 --> 01:26:55,823
[SPEAKER_22]: They're gonna come back in, now they have, they're supposed to have structured, okay, so say if we send two ambulances out to Arlington, okay, they are supposed to have zones where, as they're supposed to be staged.

810
01:26:57,377 --> 01:27:01,599
[SPEAKER_22]: in the event that they have to come into Medford if they lose coverage and so forth.

811
01:27:02,019 --> 01:27:13,264
[SPEAKER_22]: And what I think's happening is they're dispatching our Medford ambulances out of the city and then getting the resources coming back into the city.

812
01:27:14,245 --> 01:27:25,090
[SPEAKER_22]: We had A1 and A2 on a boat call to leave the city and it took approximately 20 minutes for another ambulance, say Stonem, to come in to cover the city.

813
01:27:26,202 --> 01:27:30,247
[SPEAKER_22]: And on this occasion here, we didn't have a medical call.

814
01:27:30,307 --> 01:27:35,053
[SPEAKER_22]: However, that's still leaving the city vulnerable at that time, just in case something did happen.

815
01:27:36,620 --> 01:27:39,361
[SPEAKER_22]: It's something that could have been fixed that was never fixed.

816
01:27:39,641 --> 01:27:56,647
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so this is why I'm bringing this forward because my conversations with understanding advanced life support that Armstrong is adamant that we know that if there's a call and if Arlington or any mutual aid needs the advanced life support ambulance, they have to go.

817
01:27:57,612 --> 01:27:58,773
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm not sure if they have to go.

818
01:27:58,793 --> 01:28:05,358
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that by state, I believe that's what I was shared with, with, uh, straight rules and regulations by emergency response.

819
01:28:05,999 --> 01:28:06,499
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

820
01:28:06,679 --> 01:28:08,481
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just letting you know.

821
01:28:08,961 --> 01:28:11,023
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's what was stated to me.

822
01:28:11,083 --> 01:28:18,329
[SPEAKER_09]: But I asked the question, are you saying that we're not covered for advanced life support?

823
01:28:18,349 --> 01:28:22,112
[SPEAKER_09]: Because what I've been told, and this is why we're here,

824
01:28:22,903 --> 01:28:27,559
[SPEAKER_09]: is that Armstrong rotates and we have our zones covered whenever

825
01:28:28,316 --> 01:28:32,357
[SPEAKER_09]: our ambulances are shifted to mutual aid.

826
01:28:32,497 --> 01:28:33,597
[SPEAKER_09]: There have been times.

827
01:28:33,817 --> 01:28:34,357
[SPEAKER_09]: You're saying that?

828
01:28:34,398 --> 01:28:35,418
[SPEAKER_22]: There have been times, yes.

829
01:28:35,518 --> 01:28:35,938
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, OK.

830
01:28:36,158 --> 01:28:36,618
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

831
01:28:36,718 --> 01:28:39,099
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think also Armstrong is a growing company.

832
01:28:40,059 --> 01:28:40,999
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all I'm asking.

833
01:28:41,019 --> 01:28:43,880
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to go there with that, because I think that this is the facts.

834
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:44,880
[SPEAKER_09]: We're trying to get these out.

835
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:45,700
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep, that's right.

836
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:51,162
[SPEAKER_09]: Because if we started bringing up what we think about what the other company has and stuff like that, we're going to bog down things.

837
01:28:51,702 --> 01:28:57,143
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now, it's understanding what the questions are that have left the city in question, because we haven't been transparent.

838
01:28:57,483 --> 01:29:02,668
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so this is something when I've spoken with Armstrong, it's total opposite.

839
01:29:03,349 --> 01:29:04,210
[SPEAKER_09]: They can show us.

840
01:29:05,251 --> 01:29:08,534
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's something that, you know, it's the first time I heard response time from this team.

841
01:29:09,055 --> 01:29:20,747
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the first time that you said that you had a professional or someone in your staff pulling up numbers and it's daunting and you used explaining samplings.

842
01:29:22,938 --> 01:29:35,681
[SPEAKER_09]: This is what, why I found it curious, why I felt so strongly about this because Armstrong gave us data that goes to the state when it comes to a four minute, 30, four minute, 30 second response time.

843
01:29:36,281 --> 01:29:37,821
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's where the alert came up.

844
01:29:38,421 --> 01:29:51,684
[SPEAKER_09]: If we're questioning that and then you look at the trends for other companies where it doesn't even come close to that and you've now provided us with an understanding that through some sampling that Armstrong

845
01:29:52,436 --> 01:29:57,004
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not true because there's shuffling and the numbers are wrong and we're off two minutes.

846
01:29:57,064 --> 01:30:01,832
[SPEAKER_09]: Well this is the reason why we're here and I'm sure Armstrong is going to give us a better indication.

847
01:30:01,852 --> 01:30:06,700
[SPEAKER_09]: I will share with you what they've given us, what they've given me at least.

848
01:30:07,455 --> 01:30:11,600
[SPEAKER_09]: The breakdowns and how it was broken down and the data, it's not sampling.

849
01:30:11,661 --> 01:30:12,642
[SPEAKER_09]: It seems pretty concrete.

850
01:30:13,263 --> 01:30:23,476
[SPEAKER_09]: So I hope that Armstrong will share with all of us because this is something whether we move on, Armstrong is gone, the new provider comes in, this is alarming to me because it's going to come down to public safety.

851
01:30:24,734 --> 01:30:28,377
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have to make sure that if these are the issues, is that what everybody's going on?

852
01:30:28,797 --> 01:30:33,701
[SPEAKER_09]: Is everybody going on this response time when it's called and they wait two minutes?

853
01:30:34,141 --> 01:30:36,423
[SPEAKER_09]: So they say that it's 4.30 but it's really 6.30.

854
01:30:36,523 --> 01:30:41,367
[SPEAKER_09]: So these are the things that as an average person, very alarming.

855
01:30:42,208 --> 01:30:42,728
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you.

856
01:30:43,289 --> 01:30:46,511
[SPEAKER_22]: You also asked about are we ready and are we prepared?

857
01:30:46,931 --> 01:30:47,892
[SPEAKER_22]: Do you want me to answer that?

858
01:30:48,432 --> 01:30:52,514
[SPEAKER_09]: That's going to come because there's a lot that we have that I don't know if we are.

859
01:30:52,594 --> 01:30:57,798
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to stick on the, I think we might be done with the coverage and response times.

860
01:30:57,838 --> 01:31:00,259
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's anything else you want to add on coverage and response times.

861
01:31:00,820 --> 01:31:04,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we're going to go to the payments and then I think we might hear from Armstrong.

862
01:31:04,842 --> 01:31:06,223
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, coverage and response times.

863
01:31:06,514 --> 01:31:07,655
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, thank you, President Bears.

864
01:31:07,695 --> 01:31:11,358
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we have some specific examples that I think it's warranted to go through, if we could please.

865
01:31:12,138 --> 01:31:19,243
[SPEAKER_22]: Chief Evans already went through most of the times and so forth, the same stuff that we have.

866
01:31:19,403 --> 01:31:24,307
[SPEAKER_22]: We had a call on Harvard Street, motor vehicle crash about a month and a half ago.

867
01:31:25,388 --> 01:31:27,429
[SPEAKER_22]: We dispatched everybody.

868
01:31:30,193 --> 01:31:33,416
[SPEAKER_22]: Engine 5 asked for, you know, an update in the ambulance twice.

869
01:31:34,317 --> 01:31:36,919
[SPEAKER_22]: We tried to get confirmation from Armstrong.

870
01:31:37,239 --> 01:31:41,342
[SPEAKER_22]: They updated us with several ambulances responding.

871
01:31:41,783 --> 01:31:45,646
[SPEAKER_22]: And if you see in the data, you can see that enroute, canceled, enroute.

872
01:31:46,707 --> 01:31:52,712
[SPEAKER_22]: So it was about 25 minutes after the initial call where the party took themselves to the hospital.

873
01:31:53,212 --> 01:31:57,516
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think that shouldn't happen.

874
01:31:59,526 --> 01:32:06,242
[SPEAKER_22]: You need the resources to provide for your city but like the chief haven't said he has some of those as well.

875
01:32:14,950 --> 01:32:16,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, go ahead.

876
01:32:16,071 --> 01:32:20,033
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, I have several reports that there were questions on.

877
01:32:20,093 --> 01:32:36,382
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, just some of the, even some recent ones as of, you know, Friday I mentioned some of the response times that there were a couple that were like 13 minutes, 14 minutes, that again it shows a,

878
01:32:38,662 --> 01:32:49,584
[SPEAKER_02]: what time they're responding and what time they're at the scene, but those calculations are not getting factored into the actual, the averages.

879
01:32:50,204 --> 01:33:03,006
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was marked, there were two calls, one was 14 minutes, one was 13 minutes, and those were marked as patient refusals, so those didn't calculate into the averages.

880
01:33:04,126 --> 01:33:08,007
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's come up in other reports also,

881
01:33:10,061 --> 01:33:11,782
[SPEAKER_02]: where it's kind of the same situation.

882
01:33:12,982 --> 01:33:28,044
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've highlighted several reports that it might not make sense to you, but the on scene times that I've marked on some of these things.

883
01:33:28,084 --> 01:33:36,146
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've asked, again, I asked them about some of the response times and they mentioned like shoot time issues which,

884
01:33:37,995 --> 01:33:45,217
[SPEAKER_02]: They're referring to like the, I guess getting ready and getting to the truck and getting out the door as far as a shoot time issue.

885
01:33:47,758 --> 01:33:55,180
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have some instances of in October, nine minute response times.

886
01:33:56,580 --> 01:33:59,301
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got September, January issues.

887
01:33:59,541 --> 01:34:03,802
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got issues from earlier in October where I see

888
01:34:05,663 --> 01:34:08,985
[SPEAKER_02]: 13 minute and 55 second response time.

889
01:34:09,966 --> 01:34:13,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Same day, 8 minutes 37 seconds.

890
01:34:16,209 --> 01:34:23,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I've asked some questions and just kind of got a reply that the crew will be addressed with and we will get back to you.

891
01:34:25,274 --> 01:34:26,355
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't hear back on that.

892
01:34:31,077 --> 01:34:32,497
[SPEAKER_02]: We have some other dates here.

893
01:34:32,517 --> 01:34:42,880
[SPEAKER_02]: This one's in September where I see a call for 7 minutes, 47 seconds, and then another time here for 17 minutes and 21 seconds.

894
01:34:43,941 --> 01:34:51,883
[SPEAKER_02]: And then again, that one's kind of showing me a truck responding, and then another truck en route, and then another truck listed as on arrival.

895
01:34:52,683 --> 01:34:58,084
[SPEAKER_02]: So multiple trucks, but curious about the timing.

896
01:34:58,925 --> 01:35:00,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Another call in that same,

897
01:35:00,918 --> 01:35:06,079
[SPEAKER_02]: related to that same incident, there's another column that mentions 11 minutes response time.

898
01:35:07,180 --> 01:35:14,422
[SPEAKER_02]: And then just further down the column on that same day, another 7 minutes, 42 second response time.

899
01:35:19,263 --> 01:35:29,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Chief, just if I could, I mean, I think any incident of a long response time, right, a single or multiple incidents, right, we want to correct that.

900
01:35:31,378 --> 01:35:34,220
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, it's still data by anecdote a little bit.

901
01:35:34,500 --> 01:35:42,686
[SPEAKER_05]: And what I want to try to understand is are we seeing that a larger proportion of calls are having a response time more than 10 minutes?

902
01:35:43,226 --> 01:35:47,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we seeing that the average response time has been going up over the last few years?

903
01:35:47,309 --> 01:35:55,815
[SPEAKER_05]: Like from that data perspective, because I understand like individual calls being problematic and wanting that to be corrected, but I'm just trying to understand

904
01:35:57,267 --> 01:36:12,294
[SPEAKER_05]: from your perspective or the data from the 911 side of things, like, are more calls having longer response time or is the average going up and, you know, is it relatively steady there's been calls over with more than 10 minute response time?

905
01:36:12,354 --> 01:36:21,898
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 5% of the calls or, you know, because that I think gives us a better picture to understand how long longer response times in these specific scenarios might be.

906
01:36:22,836 --> 01:36:25,177
[SPEAKER_05]: related, like how does that fit into a larger context?

907
01:36:25,817 --> 01:36:36,002
[SPEAKER_02]: It just kind of calls into question some of these when I ask for explanations or they tell me that they're going to speak to a crew and then follow up with me and tell me about it.

908
01:36:36,702 --> 01:36:37,723
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not seeing that happen.

909
01:36:37,783 --> 01:36:46,647
[SPEAKER_02]: So it kind of calls into question when I look at the reports, all the daily reports, if that is getting communicated to me correctly and

910
01:36:47,507 --> 01:36:50,430
[SPEAKER_02]: accurately and if the situation is being dealt with.

911
01:36:50,750 --> 01:36:51,130
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

912
01:36:51,631 --> 01:36:51,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Got it.

913
01:36:52,231 --> 01:36:56,675
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you seeing on the reports that like the same crews are having the same issues or trucks having the same issues?

914
01:36:56,835 --> 01:36:58,076
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know who the crew might be.

915
01:36:58,356 --> 01:37:03,941
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know who it is because if I ask them, I just get the vague, we'll speak to them.

916
01:37:04,382 --> 01:37:05,202
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know who it was.

917
01:37:05,583 --> 01:37:10,607
[SPEAKER_05]: Just from a trends perspective, would you say that, you know,

918
01:37:12,428 --> 01:37:18,311
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess basically back to my question, is a higher percentage of calls having response times over 10 minutes than it has in the past?

919
01:37:20,232 --> 01:37:21,673
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure.

920
01:37:23,114 --> 01:37:24,715
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just trying to wonder if it's getting better or worse.

921
01:37:24,955 --> 01:37:32,239
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the thing that I would add is that we are seeing an alarming number, and Supervisor Salve mentioned this, we're seeing an alarming number of times where

922
01:37:33,363 --> 01:37:35,845
[SPEAKER_14]: Vehicles that are labeled Medford are not in Medford.

923
01:37:35,925 --> 01:37:40,748
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's evident to Medford that Armstrong has stretched themselves too thin.

924
01:37:40,808 --> 01:37:49,773
[SPEAKER_14]: They haven't invested enough resources into staffing and into vehicles to provide the services that need to be provided in a timely manner.

925
01:37:50,253 --> 01:37:57,538
[SPEAKER_14]: And we saw that time and time again, and Supervisor Salve can speak to that, that it just, it got, it seemed to get more and more and more frequent.

926
01:37:57,718 --> 01:38:01,620
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess, okay, well, that's a different, you know, that last statement is different.

927
01:38:01,660 --> 01:38:04,602
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I'm just wondering what the statistical basis is for that, right?

928
01:38:05,222 --> 01:38:09,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we seeing more calls with longer response times over time?

929
01:38:09,384 --> 01:38:12,746
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it worse in 2025 than it was in 2024 and 2023?

930
01:38:13,446 --> 01:38:26,493
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, are we seeing, what you just last said, and if Supervisor Saave can speak to this specific question, like, are we seeing that trucks with the name Medford on it, where there's fewer trucks in Medford over time than there have been in the past, and kind of how, because,

931
01:38:27,133 --> 01:38:36,023
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we can pick out examples that are bad, and obviously we want those to be corrected, but I'm just not understanding how it fits into change over time, and I think that's important when we're talking about data.

932
01:38:36,043 --> 01:38:38,766
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you have thoughts on that, Supervisor.

933
01:38:39,686 --> 01:38:40,546
[SPEAKER_22]: Can you repeat that?

934
01:38:41,326 --> 01:38:53,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, are you seeing that response times have been getting longer over time, or have you been seeing that there's been a difference over time where more trucks are not in Medford and are in other communities?

935
01:38:53,689 --> 01:39:00,351
[SPEAKER_22]: I will say that over the course of the last year and a half, I have seen a decrease in response times.

936
01:39:01,211 --> 01:39:02,171
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an increase?

937
01:39:02,571 --> 01:39:03,272
[SPEAKER_22]: An increase, yeah.

938
01:39:03,672 --> 01:39:09,413
[SPEAKER_22]: And I've also seen an increase of responding to other communities, specifically Arlington.

939
01:39:10,113 --> 01:39:14,215
[SPEAKER_05]: And do we have data on what that increase is or how?

940
01:39:15,456 --> 01:39:18,257
[SPEAKER_22]: We don't have specific data on when they leave the city.

941
01:39:18,277 --> 01:39:24,900
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, we have tape recordings every day on how many times they leave the city.

942
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:28,782
[SPEAKER_22]: And I would average 6 to 10 times per day.

943
01:39:29,162 --> 01:39:31,603
[SPEAKER_05]: And how does that compare to, say, like two years ago?

944
01:39:32,525 --> 01:39:36,710
[SPEAKER_22]: It wasn't as it wasn't as much maybe maybe two maybe three times.

945
01:39:37,091 --> 01:39:42,838
[SPEAKER_22]: It has it has gone up and significantly on them leaving the city.

946
01:39:42,858 --> 01:39:45,361
[SPEAKER_05]: I think if there was a report on that it would be helpful to see.

947
01:39:46,038 --> 01:39:49,301
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't have any data to support that.

948
01:39:49,461 --> 01:39:54,004
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, when they tell us they're leaving the city, there's no CAD entry or anything like that.

949
01:39:56,186 --> 01:40:02,531
[SPEAKER_22]: They let us know that they're leaving the city, and then we know who we have in the city, who's left.

950
01:40:03,091 --> 01:40:06,594
[SPEAKER_22]: Anytime somebody comes in or out of the city, Armstrong does let us know.

951
01:40:07,174 --> 01:40:09,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, and what do you mean they let you know?

952
01:40:09,843 --> 01:40:11,464
[SPEAKER_22]: They'll say A1's covering the city.

953
01:40:12,325 --> 01:40:17,448
[SPEAKER_22]: A1's going to Armstrong or Stoneham, whatever it is, is covering Medford and so forth.

954
01:40:17,468 --> 01:40:17,668
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

955
01:40:17,868 --> 01:40:21,531
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to hold that one and see if they have a report on their end.

956
01:40:21,551 --> 01:40:25,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have any more questions on coverage and response time?

957
01:40:29,315 --> 01:40:29,976
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think I have.

958
01:40:30,016 --> 01:40:31,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, I really don't think I have.

959
01:40:31,577 --> 01:40:33,618
[SPEAKER_05]: But OK.

960
01:40:34,199 --> 01:40:37,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we want to move to the questions about payments?

961
01:40:37,941 --> 01:40:38,221
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

962
01:40:38,541 --> 01:40:39,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli?

963
01:40:40,747 --> 01:40:45,829
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, all right, Councilor Leming, I know you had a question about the payment, and then we'll go to Councilor Scarpelli.

964
01:40:46,329 --> 01:41:03,395
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so it sounds like some personnel from Armstrong met with Chief Buckley March 2025, and they said that they would not pay back a certain amount of money that they owed the city.

965
01:41:05,255 --> 01:41:09,037
[SPEAKER_11]: The two things that are on my mind about this is how

966
01:41:11,668 --> 01:41:18,710
[SPEAKER_11]: did they stick with that position over the course of a few months, and when did they flip the position?

967
01:41:18,750 --> 01:41:26,432
[SPEAKER_11]: Because it sounds like when my colleague spoke with Armstrong, they said, no, we're perfectly willing to pay the money back.

968
01:41:26,472 --> 01:41:29,213
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll just take a while, because it's a lot of money.

969
01:41:29,693 --> 01:41:33,774
[SPEAKER_11]: But it sounds like from what the chief was saying, that they were just straight up, no, we won't do that.

970
01:41:33,974 --> 01:41:35,495
[SPEAKER_11]: What I'm interested to know is,

971
01:41:36,555 --> 01:41:49,518
[SPEAKER_11]: when did that position change, and did the personnel that met with the chief, were they sort of in a, did they have the authority to make that call?

972
01:41:49,558 --> 01:41:52,859
[SPEAKER_11]: Did they have the authority to say, we're not gonna do that?

973
01:41:53,059 --> 01:42:00,861
[SPEAKER_11]: Because, you know, obviously it sounds like the president of Armstrong said that they would be willing to,

974
01:42:02,382 --> 01:42:11,031
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm just kind of wondering the timeline of communication and when that decision was made.

975
01:42:11,071 --> 01:42:19,480
[SPEAKER_11]: The other thing on my mind is, can you just explain in a little bit more detail what the nature of that argument was?

976
01:42:21,773 --> 01:42:26,676
[SPEAKER_11]: Armstrong have that many back payments that they owe the city, and what were those for?

977
01:42:26,696 --> 01:42:38,044
[SPEAKER_11]: I apologize if this was already explained earlier in the meeting, but I'd just like some more sort of in-depth explanation of what the issues were going on there.

978
01:42:38,064 --> 01:42:41,226
[SPEAKER_11]: It was like a contractual thing, like what happened.

979
01:42:42,658 --> 01:42:43,998
[SPEAKER_11]: starting from just square one.

980
01:42:44,478 --> 01:42:45,159
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure.

981
01:42:45,519 --> 01:43:05,143
[SPEAKER_14]: I think Chief Buckley would be best to answer some of the portions of this, but basically at some point in the process when the city started, this was the city identifying, no, these are payments that are due to the city and we were working with them to resolve that, but they were being

982
01:43:06,364 --> 01:43:10,987
[SPEAKER_14]: unwilling to, but we forced their hand to make those payments, but we forced their hand.

983
01:43:12,068 --> 01:43:13,910
[SPEAKER_14]: Frankly, Armstrong hasn't made one of the payments.

984
01:43:17,032 --> 01:43:18,754
[SPEAKER_14]: So they had $300,000 owed to the city.

985
01:43:19,874 --> 01:43:20,335
[SPEAKER_14]: They have paid $225,000.

986
01:43:20,455 --> 01:43:21,676
[SPEAKER_14]: Just to follow up on that, if I may.

987
01:43:31,008 --> 01:43:33,409
[SPEAKER_05]: So the contract says that there's $75,000.

988
01:43:34,050 --> 01:43:39,592
[SPEAKER_05]: It says that the city has to provide documentation as to what the money was used for.

989
01:43:41,613 --> 01:43:49,197
[SPEAKER_05]: Did the city invoice Armstrong each year over the past five years for that funds and they were not paid in the year that they were invoiced?

990
01:43:51,138 --> 01:43:52,719
[SPEAKER_05]: One second, yeah, I'll turn on your microphone.

991
01:43:53,279 --> 01:43:56,621
[SPEAKER_14]: I welcome Chief Buckley to speak to some of those details because I'm less familiar with him.

992
01:43:58,539 --> 01:44:00,640
[SPEAKER_13]: probably even further less but they were not.

993
01:44:00,661 --> 01:44:11,488
[SPEAKER_13]: It wasn't till this early 2025 that we had a project going on in dispatch of communications and that we needed funded for it.

994
01:44:11,688 --> 01:44:17,752
[SPEAKER_13]: And members of my staff along with Chief Evans put together some plans to

995
01:44:20,435 --> 01:44:27,200
[SPEAKER_13]: redesigned some aspects of the Emergency Communication Center and the funding would have come from there and they reached out to Armstrong.

996
01:44:27,821 --> 01:44:34,005
[SPEAKER_13]: I wasn't part of that initial conversation but I believe it was a result of those conversations where Armstrong came to me and asked for that meeting.

997
01:44:34,445 --> 01:44:37,828
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's where they made the statement that they would not pay or they were not going to pay.

998
01:44:38,428 --> 01:44:39,689
[SPEAKER_05]: So just so I can get that.

999
01:44:40,550 --> 01:44:44,533
[SPEAKER_05]: So the city had not invoiced Armstrong for several years until March.

1000
01:44:47,236 --> 01:44:52,137
[SPEAKER_13]: It was, just to be clear, the part of that answer is yes, and the other part is we did not invoice them much.

1001
01:44:52,177 --> 01:44:56,818
[SPEAKER_13]: We were asking for them to, their support in providing the payments at that time.

1002
01:44:56,958 --> 01:45:01,639
[SPEAKER_13]: So it was a technical invoice, but we were, members of the team talked to them about providing payments.

1003
01:45:01,979 --> 01:45:02,279
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1004
01:45:05,780 --> 01:45:06,020
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1005
01:45:06,500 --> 01:45:07,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1006
01:45:08,260 --> 01:45:10,981
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me shed a little light, just so you know where I stand.

1007
01:45:13,041 --> 01:45:15,602
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a process that was started back with Chief Gilberti.

1008
01:45:17,461 --> 01:45:31,430
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was, I believe it's $70,000 at the time that the negotiation that the chief would provide Armstrong with a request of payment showing invoices year to year.

1009
01:45:32,730 --> 01:45:33,231
[SPEAKER_09]: They did that.

1010
01:45:34,111 --> 01:45:35,752
[SPEAKER_09]: Then the question came about with Mayor Burke.

1011
01:45:36,233 --> 01:45:39,174
[SPEAKER_09]: This is what communication Armstrong explained it.

1012
01:45:39,975 --> 01:45:43,137
[SPEAKER_09]: When it came to Mayor Burke, Mayor Burke said, this looks funny.

1013
01:45:44,217 --> 01:45:44,798
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like

1014
01:45:45,594 --> 01:45:48,655
[SPEAKER_09]: It could be construed maliciously, right?

1015
01:45:49,135 --> 01:45:51,415
[SPEAKER_09]: So we need to then change the verbiage.

1016
01:45:51,835 --> 01:45:54,436
[SPEAKER_09]: That was the question that was brought up back in the day.

1017
01:45:54,536 --> 01:46:09,279
[SPEAKER_09]: So it was $75,000 that would be requested by the city that would focus on, I believe, the 911 center, anything dealing with funding for the 911 center, radios, AEDs, training, whatever that may be.

1018
01:46:11,679 --> 01:46:14,020
[SPEAKER_09]: When this present mirror started,

1019
01:46:15,053 --> 01:46:30,120
[SPEAKER_09]: She went four years without requesting anything until this past year when the 911 supervisor reached out to Armstrong and said, we want $75,000 because we bought this.

1020
01:46:31,641 --> 01:46:35,763
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe Armstrong explained this with the attorneys during negotiations.

1021
01:46:36,503 --> 01:46:37,984
[SPEAKER_09]: City solicitor concurred, I believe.

1022
01:46:38,826 --> 01:46:44,110
[SPEAKER_09]: and KP Law that, yes, we understand that this doesn't look right.

1023
01:46:44,210 --> 01:46:47,893
[SPEAKER_09]: We can't just give you that money because you didn't request it.

1024
01:46:48,213 --> 01:46:52,616
[SPEAKER_09]: Because someone didn't read the contract, Madam Chief of Staff.

1025
01:46:53,417 --> 01:47:00,222
[SPEAKER_09]: Year to year, someone was to reach out and ask for these funds with written documentation stating what it's for.

1026
01:47:00,242 --> 01:47:01,803
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not cutting you a blank check.

1027
01:47:02,283 --> 01:47:02,904
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what we're told.

1028
01:47:03,984 --> 01:47:06,086
[SPEAKER_09]: That this year, it was presented to them for $75,000.

1029
01:47:08,125 --> 01:47:29,338
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe Armstrong, in good will, cut the check that I believe our leadership team was supposed to send documentations of what they were paying, which I believe Armstrong will tell us later, which I'm curious to know, that they still haven't received those documents, what they paid for this year.

1030
01:47:30,147 --> 01:47:37,292
[SPEAKER_09]: So I believe that was part of the negotiations that stated, well, we still want to support Medford.

1031
01:47:37,352 --> 01:47:39,693
[SPEAKER_09]: We still want to show him good faith.

1032
01:47:40,194 --> 01:47:56,865
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll then move past in the next contract, which Armstrong shared with me, that was presented to KP Law and the former city solicitor, that it was for the next five years they would honor $35,000 to make up for this money, but they can't give this money

1033
01:47:57,600 --> 01:48:06,746
[SPEAKER_09]: from the past because it wasn't presented correctly and it wasn't asked for at the time.

1034
01:48:06,846 --> 01:48:08,927
[SPEAKER_09]: So the clock can't go back to get that money.

1035
01:48:09,607 --> 01:48:19,994
[SPEAKER_09]: If I'm wrong, explain that because I'm sure that from the information that Armstrong shared with me, it'll be interesting to see where we are because it's funny, this is where I'm getting hung up on.

1036
01:48:21,254 --> 01:48:22,996
[SPEAKER_09]: We just talked about response time.

1037
01:48:23,536 --> 01:48:25,197
[SPEAKER_09]: We just talked about how bothered we were.

1038
01:48:26,467 --> 01:48:26,667
[SPEAKER_09]: Right?

1039
01:48:27,347 --> 01:48:30,249
[SPEAKER_09]: Back in some time ago.

1040
01:48:31,589 --> 01:48:38,373
[SPEAKER_09]: But then we'd still entertain negotiations and then come to this point and then realize, holy cow, you owe us money.

1041
01:48:38,953 --> 01:48:39,713
[SPEAKER_09]: Pay us money now.

1042
01:48:40,674 --> 01:48:46,256
[SPEAKER_09]: Then the answer was, we can't pay this money because of A, B, and C. And now here we stand.

1043
01:48:46,897 --> 01:48:51,359
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you see where the lack of transparency comes in and why it leaves questions in the public?

1044
01:48:51,951 --> 01:48:57,794
[SPEAKER_09]: for where they're saying, well, this is about money or this is about, you know, questionable issues.

1045
01:48:58,394 --> 01:49:12,060
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is where I want to bring forth that before we continue, you know where it's coming from on this side, because as I share with my Councilors, that's what at least was shared with me, because we don't have a city solicitor.

1046
01:49:12,080 --> 01:49:13,640
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't reach out to him, although I tried.

1047
01:49:14,080 --> 01:49:14,561
[SPEAKER_09]: He's gone.

1048
01:49:14,621 --> 01:49:15,121
[SPEAKER_09]: We let him go.

1049
01:49:16,068 --> 01:49:16,388
[SPEAKER_09]: K.P.

1050
01:49:16,408 --> 01:49:19,412
[SPEAKER_09]: Law, we don't have anybody that we can talk to in K.P.

1051
01:49:19,452 --> 01:49:19,672
[SPEAKER_09]: Law.

1052
01:49:19,932 --> 01:49:25,017
[SPEAKER_09]: And unfortunately, our chiefs or yourself, Madam Chief of Staff, you weren't involved in that negotiation.

1053
01:49:25,338 --> 01:49:29,482
[SPEAKER_09]: So we can't ask those questions when it comes to the money and why and how that came about.

1054
01:49:30,003 --> 01:49:37,510
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you see where our confusion as the fiscal stewards of this community about our money, where we are and why we're concerned?

1055
01:49:37,971 --> 01:49:38,852
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope you understand that.

1056
01:49:39,897 --> 01:49:40,437
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, thank you.

1057
01:49:40,658 --> 01:49:54,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, just to, just very quickly, yeah, I think my, my questions are along the lines of what Councilor Scarpelli said, which was there an intentional decision not to invoice Armstrong for a period of time and then while working on this project to then invoice them?

1058
01:49:57,189 --> 01:50:03,774
[SPEAKER_05]: And then as the contract states, they're like, there needs to be documentation of why we're invoicing.

1059
01:50:03,794 --> 01:50:06,976
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds like there was a related project around dispatch at this time.

1060
01:50:09,030 --> 01:50:18,516
[SPEAKER_05]: So just trying and then asking if that documentation was received like was documentation provided for the full four years or however many years of payments weren't invoiced at the time.

1061
01:50:18,576 --> 01:50:22,338
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just trying to understand like was this, we made a choice not to do this.

1062
01:50:22,638 --> 01:50:38,007
[SPEAKER_05]: We knew we could do this but we made a choice not to because we didn't have valid expenses and then we came back when we had a big project and wanted to invoice and provide documentation for a larger amount of funds or was this we didn't know we could invoice and then we found the provision and then we started doing it at this time.

1063
01:50:43,171 --> 01:50:47,477
[SPEAKER_13]: So I believe there may be some parts of both of those aspects that are true.

1064
01:50:47,958 --> 01:50:54,527
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think it's sort of disingenuous to say today that, well, hey, if you didn't build them in year one, we're not going to pay you.

1065
01:50:54,687 --> 01:50:56,750
[SPEAKER_13]: If you didn't build them in year two, we're not going to pay you.

1066
01:50:57,451 --> 01:50:59,634
[SPEAKER_13]: And in support of that argument, I'll say to you that

1067
01:51:02,556 --> 01:51:05,937
[SPEAKER_13]: Once these, it was reported to us that they were not going to make these payments.

1068
01:51:08,017 --> 01:51:09,878
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't directly negotiate this contract.

1069
01:51:09,958 --> 01:51:13,099
[SPEAKER_13]: We have advised them that they needed to speak with the mayor.

1070
01:51:13,779 --> 01:51:15,880
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, Armstrong themselves went over and presented.

1071
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:24,983
[SPEAKER_13]: They were willing to pay the mayor right then and there a percentage of that funds without any invoice or documentation or any requirements.

1072
01:51:25,023 --> 01:51:29,404
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, they suddenly changed their picture because I think they thought or they suspected that

1073
01:51:29,864 --> 01:51:31,395
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, we have an upcoming contract.

1074
01:51:33,557 --> 01:51:37,418
[SPEAKER_13]: maybe our future is in jeopardy here, or maybe somebody might call to question another company.

1075
01:51:38,018 --> 01:51:45,800
[SPEAKER_13]: And then later on, another payment was made, again, I don't know the terms of the payments, without, again, asking us for invoice.

1076
01:51:46,380 --> 01:52:02,204
[SPEAKER_13]: So while it might be okay to say today that, well, you didn't get the money because you didn't ask them for the money on day one of 2023, you didn't invoice them, Armstrong themselves were willing to provide this money at a later date when they felt that their negotiations were in jeopardy.

1077
01:52:02,844 --> 01:52:14,768
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I think it is disingenuous to today say, hey, you didn't do what you had to do, yet later on say, well, we're willing to do this and not request any of those funds or any of those invoices or any of those policies.

1078
01:52:14,988 --> 01:52:17,169
[SPEAKER_13]: But as far as the project, I just want to be clear about this project.

1079
01:52:17,209 --> 01:52:18,849
[SPEAKER_13]: The project was a plan at the time.

1080
01:52:18,889 --> 01:52:22,270
[SPEAKER_13]: We didn't do any work that we could invoice as of yet.

1081
01:52:22,450 --> 01:52:30,633
[SPEAKER_13]: It was early stages, and it was me who suggested to those making the plans to reach out to Armstrong and have the conversations with him.

1082
01:52:32,012 --> 01:52:34,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Chief, I'm not saying either side.

1083
01:52:36,157 --> 01:52:48,894
[SPEAKER_05]: To the same point, I think someone could assert that if the city didn't invoice for multiple years and then invoice at the beginning of a year where a contract was up for negotiation this amount of payments and said we don't have documentation.

1084
01:52:49,895 --> 01:53:00,322
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the person who has the contract knew that their contract was up for negotiation, that they would feel like they had to provide the money without the documentation to move forward.

1085
01:53:00,362 --> 01:53:02,884
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just think like the way that you framed it could go both ways.

1086
01:53:03,024 --> 01:53:11,149
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think, you know, if we want to call either of those framings disingenuous, because obviously they're suppositional in either direction, but I think they could go in either direction.

1087
01:53:11,189 --> 01:53:19,115
[SPEAKER_05]: Like if I suddenly in the year my contract is up got told, not even an invoice, just said, we want you to pay four years of payments right now,

1088
01:53:19,775 --> 01:53:21,916
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have the documentation that the contract says.

1089
01:53:22,537 --> 01:53:27,279
[SPEAKER_05]: I would probably feel like I really need to pay those payments because otherwise I might not get my contract renewed.

1090
01:53:27,319 --> 01:53:28,700
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think that's the point I want to make.

1091
01:53:28,760 --> 01:53:30,221
[SPEAKER_13]: Like we were early in the stages.

1092
01:53:30,261 --> 01:53:32,462
[SPEAKER_13]: We didn't have anything to provide them yet.

1093
01:53:32,502 --> 01:53:32,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1094
01:53:32,722 --> 01:53:36,284
[SPEAKER_13]: We were just, it was sort of like advanced, hey, we are looking to do a project here.

1095
01:53:36,724 --> 01:53:41,887
[SPEAKER_13]: We understand that this contract exists and funds are present in this to fund this.

1096
01:53:42,707 --> 01:53:44,208
[SPEAKER_13]: We want to bring you in early stages.

1097
01:53:44,308 --> 01:53:47,149
[SPEAKER_13]: We had not started anything to the extent that we were going to.

1098
01:53:47,769 --> 01:53:59,373
[SPEAKER_13]: I think maybe they got a proposal from some company, but we were not at the stage to present any bills or invoices for work done to Armstrong Ambulance at the time.

1099
01:53:59,993 --> 01:54:07,676
[SPEAKER_14]: It's my understanding that there was a big project in March and then there was a big project in April, and they held part of that over our, I'm sorry, in September, March and September.

1100
01:54:08,056 --> 01:54:10,377
[SPEAKER_14]: And they held one of those $75,000 payments over the city's head.

1101
01:54:12,586 --> 01:54:13,707
[SPEAKER_05]: How did they hold it over the head?

1102
01:54:14,247 --> 01:54:16,408
[SPEAKER_14]: Because they weren't prepared to, they weren't willing to pay it.

1103
01:54:16,448 --> 01:54:20,931
[SPEAKER_14]: We had to continue to push the issue in terms of the amount that was due.

1104
01:54:22,031 --> 01:54:27,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Does the contract say, and I don't have the language in front of me, that the... Sure, yeah.

1105
01:54:31,901 --> 01:54:48,928
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a basic issue that we have right now, because I think the issue is, unfortunately, the software system, I think, has to blame, because in my community that I work in, when a contract is up, we're alerted right away through purchasing, and we're told, recreation, your bus contract is expiring in three months, please A, B, and C.

1106
01:54:49,828 --> 01:54:53,170
[SPEAKER_09]: This is what the contract says that I find a little concerning.

1107
01:54:53,971 --> 01:55:09,222
[SPEAKER_09]: It says, I believe it's 10.1, on the effective date of this contract, Armstrong shall provide $75,000 payment to the city and on each of the four subsequent anniversaries of the effective date of this contract.

1108
01:55:09,742 --> 01:55:27,219
[SPEAKER_09]: Armstrong shall provide a $75,000 payment to the City, all of which will be used solely for the operations of Method 9-1-1 Dispatch Center in return for the City taking initial 9-1-1 calls and alerting Armstrong to all medical calls requested for EMS.

1109
01:55:28,640 --> 01:55:39,646
[SPEAKER_09]: provide annual financial statements to Armstrong detailing the expenditures of the funds provided herein to demonstrate that the funds are used for such purposes.

1110
01:55:40,187 --> 01:55:56,055
[SPEAKER_09]: The parties agree that, except for the first installment of this payment, no funds should be provided to the city by the Armstrong pursuant to this section until such financial statements are provided to Armstrong for that prior year.

1111
01:55:56,095 --> 01:55:56,856
[SPEAKER_09]: So year one,

1112
01:55:57,576 --> 01:55:58,637
[SPEAKER_09]: No documentations.

1113
01:55:58,697 --> 01:56:00,737
[SPEAKER_09]: Year two, no documentations.

1114
01:56:00,777 --> 01:56:02,798
[SPEAKER_09]: Year three, no documentations.

1115
01:56:02,838 --> 01:56:08,401
[SPEAKER_09]: Year four, alerted, contacted, then the ball starts rolling.

1116
01:56:08,881 --> 01:56:10,381
[SPEAKER_09]: $75,000 for project.

1117
01:56:11,222 --> 01:56:19,085
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll give you the $75,000 in good faith as we move through negotiations, but we need the documentation.

1118
01:56:19,405 --> 01:56:21,226
[SPEAKER_09]: What was stated to me was the documentation.

1119
01:56:21,986 --> 01:56:25,567
[SPEAKER_09]: We were given the date that the city gave to Armstrong was December.

1120
01:56:27,579 --> 01:56:28,300
[SPEAKER_09]: This is clear.

1121
01:56:28,320 --> 01:56:29,200
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a contract.

1122
01:56:30,021 --> 01:56:35,445
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it's not you, but there's a problem here that someone's not reading a contract.

1123
01:56:36,045 --> 01:56:46,152
[SPEAKER_09]: So either communities have the city solicitor's office following contracts and deadlines, or software systems that are in place that alert each department when something comes up.

1124
01:56:46,673 --> 01:56:47,293
[SPEAKER_09]: We failed.

1125
01:56:48,874 --> 01:56:49,374
[SPEAKER_09]: We failed.

1126
01:56:50,515 --> 01:56:54,038
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is the basic issue and concern I have about this funding.

1127
01:56:55,123 --> 01:57:11,017
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is where it starts now, the realities and where we are in negotiation, why it looks a little, why there are so many questions moving forward with the changing over to a new provider after 25 some odd years of impeccable service.

1128
01:57:11,838 --> 01:57:16,162
[SPEAKER_09]: So these are the things, like I said, these are the things that are concerning.

1129
01:57:16,182 --> 01:57:18,224
[SPEAKER_09]: Because if I have it, guess what?

1130
01:57:18,824 --> 01:57:19,485
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody's got it.

1131
01:57:21,272 --> 01:57:22,212
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you, Mr. President.

1132
01:57:22,232 --> 01:57:22,752
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope that helped.

1133
01:57:23,152 --> 01:57:23,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

1134
01:57:24,253 --> 01:57:25,233
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate that.

1135
01:57:27,313 --> 01:57:29,493
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess that's kind of where I'm coming from on this, right?

1136
01:57:29,553 --> 01:57:38,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the payments, the contract seems to say that the payment shouldn't be made until the documentation is provided, except for year one.

1137
01:57:38,615 --> 01:57:39,335
[SPEAKER_13]: Was the payment made?

1138
01:57:39,795 --> 01:57:40,135
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1139
01:57:40,175 --> 01:57:40,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Was the payment made?

1140
01:57:40,995 --> 01:57:41,335
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1141
01:57:41,956 --> 01:57:42,196
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

1142
01:57:42,476 --> 01:57:44,456
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, hold on a second.

1143
01:57:45,636 --> 01:57:46,476
[SPEAKER_05]: The payment wasn't made.

1144
01:57:46,496 --> 01:57:48,517
[SPEAKER_13]: By the state of the payment, it wasn't made.

1145
01:57:48,677 --> 01:57:48,897
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1146
01:57:50,865 --> 01:57:52,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Did the city invoice for the payment?

1147
01:57:53,867 --> 01:57:55,988
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just going by what he read.

1148
01:57:57,689 --> 01:57:59,210
[SPEAKER_13]: Day one, they provide $75,000?

1149
01:57:59,530 --> 01:58:10,336
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so it sounds like of the $375,000, however much the total amount is, it's four years or five years?

1150
01:58:11,136 --> 01:58:12,037
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it's four payments.

1151
01:58:12,597 --> 01:58:13,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Four payments, all right.

1152
01:58:13,677 --> 01:58:16,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Then the city was entitled to one of those without documentation.

1153
01:58:17,974 --> 01:58:20,355
[SPEAKER_13]: Correct, according to what he just read, I've just gone by what he.

1154
01:58:20,815 --> 01:58:22,796
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, according to the contract language.

1155
01:58:23,437 --> 01:58:45,807
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess my question there is, you know, three years, four years, in the beginning of the fourth year, your contract's up for renewal, and you're in a meeting, you get a call from the mayor, or it's set in a meeting, you know, you haven't paid up, it's time to pay up, and the contract says that the only amount that they need to pay

1156
01:58:46,870 --> 01:58:49,731
[SPEAKER_05]: if without documentation is that first year, right?

1157
01:58:49,891 --> 01:58:50,872
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's leave that out the door.

1158
01:58:50,892 --> 01:58:57,534
[SPEAKER_05]: 75,000 should have been paid, Citi should have invoiced it or Armstrong should have paid it, whoever, should have been done a long time ago.

1159
01:58:58,034 --> 01:59:08,798
[SPEAKER_05]: But everything else needs to be paid with documentation, only paid after the company receives documentation that the payments were for the services that the contract stipulates the payments need to be made for.

1160
01:59:10,576 --> 01:59:11,677
[SPEAKER_13]: Which would have been provided.

1161
01:59:11,897 --> 01:59:12,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Which would have been provided.

1162
01:59:12,878 --> 01:59:12,978
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.

1163
01:59:13,418 --> 01:59:13,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1164
01:59:13,738 --> 01:59:19,743
[SPEAKER_05]: But we asked for payment before the documentation was provided and the contract says payment should be made until after the documentation is provided.

1165
01:59:21,284 --> 01:59:22,205
[SPEAKER_13]: That's where I want to be clear.

1166
01:59:22,485 --> 01:59:33,834
[SPEAKER_13]: We asked that they, we asked them initially, we're planning this, we want to do this, we have a contract, the city has a contract with you, we want to use these funds, are you on board?

1167
01:59:34,435 --> 01:59:39,619
[SPEAKER_13]: That is what prompted them to come to me and say, we are not going to be making these payments.

1168
01:59:40,393 --> 01:59:40,933
[SPEAKER_05]: At all, ever?

1169
01:59:41,734 --> 01:59:42,294
[SPEAKER_13]: At all, ever.

1170
01:59:42,875 --> 01:59:43,155
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

1171
01:59:43,855 --> 01:59:44,456
[SPEAKER_13]: Back in March.

1172
01:59:45,096 --> 01:59:45,436
[SPEAKER_05]: And then?

1173
01:59:45,717 --> 01:59:47,398
[SPEAKER_13]: But ultimately, they did make payments.

1174
01:59:47,978 --> 01:59:48,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1175
01:59:48,158 --> 01:59:48,959
[SPEAKER_13]: Without invoices.

1176
01:59:49,599 --> 01:59:52,381
[SPEAKER_13]: And that was when they felt that they were in jeopardy.

1177
01:59:53,262 --> 01:59:53,562
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

1178
01:59:54,242 --> 01:59:57,785
[SPEAKER_13]: So that, again, these are important details, right?

1179
01:59:57,825 --> 02:00:05,970
[SPEAKER_05]: But I guess what I'm trying to ask is, did the city ask for more than the $75,000 that it was entitled to with not providing documentation?

1180
02:00:10,258 --> 02:00:18,864
[SPEAKER_13]: We asked if they would be party to a plan that would be more than $75,000, but we were willing to provide the documentation.

1181
02:00:19,244 --> 02:00:19,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1182
02:00:19,664 --> 02:00:24,767
[SPEAKER_05]: And was it we would ask you for the $75,000 now and the rest of it once we give you the documentation?

1183
02:00:26,128 --> 02:00:26,288
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

1184
02:00:26,568 --> 02:00:28,890
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, this is, I'll go back to March now.

1185
02:00:29,430 --> 02:00:30,411
[SPEAKER_13]: Early conversations.

1186
02:00:30,511 --> 02:00:31,692
[SPEAKER_13]: This is what we want to do.

1187
02:00:31,732 --> 02:00:32,812
[SPEAKER_13]: This is what we're looking at.

1188
02:00:32,852 --> 02:00:34,734
[SPEAKER_13]: This is what potential costs could be.

1189
02:00:35,174 --> 02:00:36,575
[SPEAKER_13]: This is our available funding.

1190
02:00:38,048 --> 02:00:39,008
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you a partner in this?

1191
02:00:39,048 --> 02:00:40,049
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you on board with this?

1192
02:00:40,249 --> 02:00:40,509
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1193
02:00:40,949 --> 02:00:42,589
[SPEAKER_13]: That was asked of them separately for me.

1194
02:00:42,610 --> 02:00:44,130
[SPEAKER_13]: That was the team that was putting this together.

1195
02:00:44,870 --> 02:00:47,251
[SPEAKER_13]: They came to me and they said we will not be making the payments.

1196
02:00:47,611 --> 02:00:47,871
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1197
02:00:48,091 --> 02:00:52,413
[SPEAKER_05]: And not we will not be making the payments until X conditions are met, just we will not be making them at all.

1198
02:00:53,653 --> 02:00:55,274
[SPEAKER_13]: Back in March, we will not be making them at all.

1199
02:00:55,634 --> 02:00:58,155
[SPEAKER_13]: Subsequently, they did make some payments without invoice.

1200
02:00:58,275 --> 02:00:59,535
[SPEAKER_05]: I will ask them about that.

1201
02:01:01,402 --> 02:01:07,567
[SPEAKER_13]: I just pointed out what happened as far as it's because the premise is that we did ask for this so we don't deserve it.

1202
02:01:08,088 --> 02:01:10,190
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not exactly clear.

1203
02:01:10,210 --> 02:01:13,473
[SPEAKER_05]: I think my premise is a little more complicated than that.

1204
02:01:14,273 --> 02:01:14,674
[SPEAKER_05]: Understood.

1205
02:01:16,675 --> 02:01:17,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Millane.

1206
02:01:19,190 --> 02:01:28,498
[SPEAKER_21]: Just in terms of the payment, after you had the conversation and they came back and said they were willing to do some sort of it, you said they gave a percentage of the payment.

1207
02:01:28,518 --> 02:01:38,306
[SPEAKER_21]: Is that percentage meant that just that 75 or percentage of a larger amount that has been, excuse me, not paid over the course of the contract?

1208
02:01:41,168 --> 02:01:43,710
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe you could speak to this a little clearer because it wasn't done with us.

1209
02:01:43,750 --> 02:01:46,653
[SPEAKER_13]: The payments were not done with on the police side or anything.

1210
02:01:47,860 --> 02:02:01,044
[SPEAKER_14]: The only thing I can add at this point is yes, that's the 75, there's $75,000 that has not been paid to date despite, and I do believe we've provided financial statements, but I don't, that $75,000 has not been provided to date.

1211
02:02:01,605 --> 02:02:07,227
[SPEAKER_21]: Even the percentage that the Chief just mentioned, the percentage of the payment was offered to be made, right?

1212
02:02:07,267 --> 02:02:08,147
[SPEAKER_21]: I can't speak to that one.

1213
02:02:08,527 --> 02:02:12,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Is the assertion that the contract requires $300,000 of payments, $75,000 a year for four years, and they've paid $225,000?

1214
02:02:12,308 --> 02:02:12,688
[SPEAKER_05]: That's correct.

1215
02:02:18,123 --> 02:02:22,344
[SPEAKER_05]: And are you saying that we gave them annual financial statements for the first three years?

1216
02:02:22,624 --> 02:02:23,925
[SPEAKER_14]: Assuming that- That's my understanding.

1217
02:02:23,965 --> 02:02:32,547
[SPEAKER_14]: I can go back and check some records, but yeah, so I don't know exactly which years, what, and I don't have that detail, but I do know that we provided some financial information at some point.

1218
02:02:32,727 --> 02:02:33,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, just quickly, Councilor Skarp.

1219
02:02:35,728 --> 02:02:41,410
[SPEAKER_09]: What was shared to me through Armstrong, special revenue receipts, 2020, Mayor Lungo-Koehn.

1220
02:02:42,313 --> 02:02:48,254
[SPEAKER_09]: $75,000, Mayor Burke requested, that was Mayor Burke, 2020, no request from the city to Armstrong.

1221
02:02:48,274 --> 02:02:51,115
[SPEAKER_09]: 2021, no request from the city to Armstrong.

1222
02:02:51,135 --> 02:02:55,535
[SPEAKER_09]: The 21st of March of 2013, there was a $25,000 grant for civic defense to reimburse Armstrong.

1223
02:02:56,036 --> 02:02:57,496
[SPEAKER_09]: Then there was a new contract.

1224
02:03:10,325 --> 02:03:18,830
[SPEAKER_09]: back in 2022 that it looks like they, we can ask Armstrong, but it says no request from city to Armstrong.

1225
02:03:18,850 --> 02:03:22,252
[SPEAKER_09]: 24, no request city to Armstrong.

1226
02:03:22,873 --> 02:03:27,335
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, 2025 at the time there was no request to the city of Armstrong.

1227
02:03:27,355 --> 02:03:30,217
[SPEAKER_09]: This is their financial breakdown that they shared with me.

1228
02:03:33,461 --> 02:03:34,942
[SPEAKER_09]: that I can forward to you, Mr. President.

1229
02:03:35,202 --> 02:03:35,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1230
02:03:35,502 --> 02:03:35,942
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be great.

1231
02:03:35,982 --> 02:03:36,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1232
02:03:38,264 --> 02:03:39,144
[SPEAKER_05]: You're good, Councilor Malauulu?

1233
02:03:39,825 --> 02:03:39,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1234
02:03:39,945 --> 02:03:40,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Leming?

1235
02:03:42,926 --> 02:03:43,787
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

1236
02:03:44,167 --> 02:03:47,869
[SPEAKER_11]: At what point between the March meeting and the

1237
02:03:50,723 --> 02:03:56,604
[SPEAKER_11]: the offer and announcement that we'd be switching to Cataldo.

1238
02:03:57,224 --> 02:04:05,966
[SPEAKER_11]: Did Armstrong's negotiating team sort of get off the position of we're not gonna give you anything?

1239
02:04:06,686 --> 02:04:13,927
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanna know what the conversations were like between time point A and time point B. Did the city just not really talk at all?

1240
02:04:13,967 --> 02:04:16,688
[SPEAKER_11]: Was there one meeting where they said something different?

1241
02:04:19,263 --> 02:04:26,207
[SPEAKER_11]: We all in the room when those conversations happen because at some point they said what they said to you, Chief Buckley.

1242
02:04:27,688 --> 02:04:37,714
[SPEAKER_11]: And then after all this went public, clearly Armstrong was saying we're willing to work with the city and pay back what we owe.

1243
02:04:38,515 --> 02:04:43,798
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to know how that position evolved and what happened behind the scenes internally.

1244
02:04:49,412 --> 02:04:55,934
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, so I guess that's going to be difficult because it wasn't done, again, with the police and or fire departments.

1245
02:04:55,994 --> 02:04:58,394
[SPEAKER_13]: At this point in time, any of the monies were dealt with.

1246
02:04:58,674 --> 02:05:00,335
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe Armstrong had a meeting with the mayor.

1247
02:05:01,515 --> 02:05:02,155
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

1248
02:05:02,215 --> 02:05:05,116
[SPEAKER_11]: And I can appreciate if you weren't in the room for those conversations.

1249
02:05:05,156 --> 02:05:06,936
[SPEAKER_11]: If you don't know the answer, that's perfectly legitimate.

1250
02:05:09,677 --> 02:05:17,670
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, and I was on medical leave also for six months, so a portion of that time is just, I don't know the timeframes of a lot of the stuff that happened.

1251
02:05:18,071 --> 02:05:21,637
[SPEAKER_13]: But I do know, I believe part of that question is,

1252
02:05:23,365 --> 02:05:25,427
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, when did Armstrong start to come forward?

1253
02:05:25,547 --> 02:05:26,487
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know when initially.

1254
02:05:26,507 --> 02:05:33,813
[SPEAKER_13]: There was multiple payments made, and I believe it was all throughout the process, but I believe it'd be my best, I don't want to give a best guess.

1255
02:05:34,053 --> 02:05:36,695
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll just leave it at that.

1256
02:05:36,715 --> 02:05:36,935
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

1257
02:05:36,975 --> 02:05:47,763
[SPEAKER_11]: What I'm trying to get to is, was this just one bad meeting, and then somebody might have come forward, like, in April and said, no, sorry, we're willing to work with you on this?

1258
02:05:49,705 --> 02:05:51,646
[SPEAKER_11]: Or was it just, or was it like they,

1259
02:05:52,607 --> 02:06:04,972
[SPEAKER_11]: repeatedly stated the position that we're not going to pay the city anything, and then only after the switch was made to Cataldo were they saying, oh, we're totally willing to, we were totally willing to do that.

1260
02:06:05,052 --> 02:06:15,257
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to know, that's why I'm interested, because I can understand if you had one bad meeting with them, but I want to know if they repeatedly stuck to that position for a sustained period of time afterwards.

1261
02:06:16,942 --> 02:06:21,688
[SPEAKER_13]: So the answer is there's that one meeting where they say we're not making the payments.

1262
02:06:21,908 --> 02:06:26,874
[SPEAKER_13]: At some future date they met with the mayor and made an offer of a payment to the mayor.

1263
02:06:27,995 --> 02:06:28,215
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

1264
02:06:28,376 --> 02:06:30,939
[SPEAKER_13]: So I don't have that date for you when that had happened.

1265
02:06:31,219 --> 02:06:31,279
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.

1266
02:06:31,399 --> 02:06:33,281
[SPEAKER_13]: And that subsequently down the road as.

1267
02:06:35,478 --> 02:06:40,802
[SPEAKER_13]: we were getting closer to negotiating and ultimately another vendor was brought in, another payment was made.

1268
02:06:40,882 --> 02:06:42,503
[SPEAKER_13]: But the details and the dates I don't have.

1269
02:06:43,043 --> 02:06:43,324
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

1270
02:06:43,544 --> 02:06:49,028
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you know, do you know like the month approximately when they next met with the mayor and made that offer?

1271
02:06:49,188 --> 02:06:49,908
[SPEAKER_11]: Like when?

1272
02:06:49,928 --> 02:06:52,130
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1273
02:06:52,150 --> 02:06:53,971
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, yeah, you're on medical leave obviously, so.

1274
02:06:53,991 --> 02:06:59,395
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't have the timeline of the meetings or the dates to that effect, but I

1275
02:07:00,053 --> 02:07:08,035
[SPEAKER_14]: Really, frankly, I understand the questions and I, you know, the council can certainly ask any questions that it has.

1276
02:07:09,316 --> 02:07:24,860
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we're, I do have one check date here in my records, but I can't reconcile the records quickly enough to be able to speak to different dates and different meetings, nor do I even know if I have necessarily that level of granularity in my communications.

1277
02:07:26,603 --> 02:07:36,548
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think we're, I do think as an overall statement, and I almost said this sooner, I do think we're getting a little bit lost in some of the realities of what happened here.

1278
02:07:36,688 --> 02:07:41,651
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a much more high level issue than I think is being discussed here.

1279
02:07:42,832 --> 02:07:49,935
[SPEAKER_14]: We have a situation where we have a contract that is effectively broken trust with the city.

1280
02:07:51,576 --> 02:07:53,257
[SPEAKER_14]: Data and reporting is in question.

1281
02:07:53,877 --> 02:07:54,918
[SPEAKER_14]: Payments are in question.

1282
02:07:55,591 --> 02:07:56,551
[SPEAKER_14]: Payments are being held.

1283
02:07:58,072 --> 02:08:04,275
[SPEAKER_14]: And we now are going into a situation where we are going into good faith negotiations with both vendors.

1284
02:08:05,556 --> 02:08:11,479
[SPEAKER_14]: And then whichever vendor from there is identified as the best for the city is awarded a contract.

1285
02:08:12,899 --> 02:08:14,260
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

1286
02:08:15,821 --> 02:08:19,403
[SPEAKER_11]: The issue is that we did dive into a lot of the data issues.

1287
02:08:19,423 --> 02:08:23,164
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that there were some, you know,

1288
02:08:25,037 --> 02:08:36,102
[SPEAKER_11]: There were some trends that we had questions about, but it sounded like the biggest issue there was just Armstrong not responding to emails when asked for explanations of these.

1289
02:08:36,182 --> 02:08:51,088
[SPEAKER_11]: It sounded like they switched from a previous system to a new system in April 2025 that maybe the city just needed some getting used to or maybe needed some explanation for why certain numbers were reported differently.

1290
02:08:51,128 --> 02:08:52,989
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't really get the sense that that was,

1291
02:08:53,529 --> 02:08:56,931
[SPEAKER_11]: that that was the deal breaker in negotiations.

1292
02:08:56,971 --> 02:09:03,734
[SPEAKER_11]: What I'm really getting the sense of is that the deal breaker is this money that was owed to the city.

1293
02:09:03,894 --> 02:09:13,859
[SPEAKER_11]: And from the sounds of it, the only time that Armstrong really broke contract was that initial $75,000 payment.

1294
02:09:13,919 --> 02:09:18,041
[SPEAKER_11]: The other times it was on the city to invoice and we simply didn't do that.

1295
02:09:22,975 --> 02:09:26,780
[SPEAKER_11]: It sounds to me like there was some internal baseball and some people got.

1296
02:09:28,427 --> 02:09:32,589
[SPEAKER_11]: ticked off at each other behind closed doors and then it all just sort of fell apart.

1297
02:09:32,629 --> 02:09:41,393
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not really getting the sense from this conversation that it was due to systemically poor performance in the field on Armstrong's part.

1298
02:09:41,413 --> 02:09:42,794
[SPEAKER_11]: Are there questions?

1299
02:09:43,474 --> 02:09:45,035
[SPEAKER_11]: Are there things that do need to be sorted out?

1300
02:09:45,075 --> 02:09:47,236
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe could they have been more responsive to emails?

1301
02:09:47,516 --> 02:09:50,057
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure, but making the switch at the point

1302
02:09:53,979 --> 02:09:59,761
[SPEAKER_11]: when we did just seemed to be kind of an extreme response to a lot of that.

1303
02:10:00,602 --> 02:10:05,183
[SPEAKER_11]: That's just the impression that I'm getting from listening.

1304
02:10:06,784 --> 02:10:20,269
[SPEAKER_14]: President Bears, through you, with all due respect, I think there's just so much here in terms of some of the data that may not have been presented the way I think would tell the full story, but it's come out today.

1305
02:10:20,309 --> 02:10:22,090
[SPEAKER_14]: I just feel like

1306
02:10:23,010 --> 02:10:30,354
[SPEAKER_14]: We're losing some of the realities of what happened over time in terms of the contract and the issues that the city faced.

1307
02:10:30,734 --> 02:10:41,179
[SPEAKER_14]: There's significant issues with response time, accountability, and trust and reporting in all of this.

1308
02:10:41,459 --> 02:10:48,103
[SPEAKER_14]: To say that it's something less than that is, I think, not a decent characterization.

1309
02:10:49,224 --> 02:10:56,969
[SPEAKER_11]: I will say that I do appreciate that you are being open about these issues.

1310
02:10:57,129 --> 02:11:07,356
[SPEAKER_11]: I enjoyed the conversation that we've had over the past two hours a lot more than the previous meeting, because are we getting into details here?

1311
02:11:07,396 --> 02:11:09,818
[SPEAKER_11]: Are we ripping through contracts?

1312
02:11:09,838 --> 02:11:12,559
[SPEAKER_11]: Are we getting into realities, complex realities?

1313
02:11:12,740 --> 02:11:16,122
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely, but that's why everybody decided to show up here.

1314
02:11:16,723 --> 02:11:19,844
[SPEAKER_11]: on a Wednesday night is to sort of hash some of this out.

1315
02:11:20,764 --> 02:11:41,370
[SPEAKER_11]: So I will say that even if these questions and conversations are difficult, I like this conversation that we're having now a lot more than the conversation that was had at the last meeting, even though I do understand the logic behind both responses, I do feel like

1316
02:11:43,448 --> 02:11:53,954
[SPEAKER_11]: Folks who would watch the recording of this do get sort of a more clear idea of what happened behind closed doors that they didn't get prior to this meeting taking place.

1317
02:11:53,974 --> 02:12:06,723
[SPEAKER_11]: So that is just me saying that I do appreciate this conversation even if it is difficult to have.

1318
02:12:07,863 --> 02:12:11,045
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's, that's, that's, that's about all I have.

1319
02:12:11,065 --> 02:12:12,326
[SPEAKER_11]: That's about all I have there.

1320
02:12:12,346 --> 02:12:14,707
[SPEAKER_05]: If, if you want to respond and then I just have a follow-up.

1321
02:12:15,528 --> 02:12:16,128
[SPEAKER_13]: Just briefly.

1322
02:12:16,148 --> 02:12:19,891
[SPEAKER_13]: I, I, I think it's the totality of all the circumstances, right?

1323
02:12:19,971 --> 02:12:21,431
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're working with the company.

1324
02:12:21,532 --> 02:12:24,133
[SPEAKER_13]: They indicate that they don't want to honor the contract.

1325
02:12:24,153 --> 02:12:25,694
[SPEAKER_13]: They want to change some practices.

1326
02:12:27,875 --> 02:12:29,476
[SPEAKER_13]: There's payments that are not made.

1327
02:12:29,496 --> 02:12:31,197
[SPEAKER_13]: There's performance issues.

1328
02:12:32,038 --> 02:12:37,101
[SPEAKER_13]: All of it suggests that reasonably responsible leaders in your community

1329
02:12:37,999 --> 02:12:42,563
[SPEAKER_13]: should look to other vendors to provide services where some of those issues could get rectified.

1330
02:12:43,704 --> 02:12:47,888
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's, I don't want to say it's as simple as that, but it's basic as that.

1331
02:12:48,909 --> 02:12:51,752
[SPEAKER_13]: If we just said, okay, you don't have to pay us the money.

1332
02:12:52,252 --> 02:12:53,614
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll pay you additional funds.

1333
02:12:54,494 --> 02:12:55,996
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't worry about the contract you signed.

1334
02:12:56,596 --> 02:12:58,038
[SPEAKER_13]: Isn't that poor leadership?

1335
02:12:58,773 --> 02:12:59,674
[SPEAKER_13]: Full responsibility?

1336
02:13:00,114 --> 02:13:08,201
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, they, I mean, they, you know, messed up by not paying us the first payment, but equally we messed up by not, by not invoicing them.

1337
02:13:08,621 --> 02:13:16,408
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think there were, there might, a reasonable person would look at this and say that there were, there were faults on, on both sides, but.

1338
02:13:16,428 --> 02:13:21,232
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, that's an argument for today, but at the time, back in March, that's not exactly what the story was.

1339
02:13:21,572 --> 02:13:22,693
[SPEAKER_13]: We are not paying you the money.

1340
02:13:22,753 --> 02:13:23,774
[SPEAKER_13]: We are not going to pay this money.

1341
02:13:23,794 --> 02:13:26,276
[SPEAKER_05]: That's, that's where my question comes in, if you don't mind, Councilor Leming.

1342
02:13:27,070 --> 02:13:28,471
[SPEAKER_05]: I've interrupted you a lot, if you want.

1343
02:13:29,651 --> 02:13:32,873
[SPEAKER_11]: It's, it's, it's, we're, we're establishing a pattern here, man.

1344
02:13:32,933 --> 02:13:33,353
[SPEAKER_11]: I, I gotta.

1345
02:13:33,373 --> 02:13:33,653
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1346
02:13:33,673 --> 02:13:34,293
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll keep talking.

1347
02:13:34,513 --> 02:13:38,115
[SPEAKER_11]: Keep going.

1348
02:13:39,275 --> 02:13:39,815
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, well, yeah.

1349
02:13:39,855 --> 02:13:44,457
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I mean, I, I, I don't, I'm not arguing against the idea that you could have one bad meeting.

1350
02:13:44,497 --> 02:13:50,760
[SPEAKER_11]: I have no doubts that the vibes and the tempers coming out of that meeting were, were very, were very negative.

1351
02:13:51,500 --> 02:13:52,361
[SPEAKER_11]: And you know, I.

1352
02:13:53,908 --> 02:14:08,114
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not arguing with that, but having one bad meeting when it seems that both parties could have been reasonably at fault here doesn't seem to me like enough of a justification to blow up a 25-year relationship.

1353
02:14:08,134 --> 02:14:14,297
[SPEAKER_11]: There were meetings after that, which I understand you weren't privy to, and maybe you weren't

1354
02:14:15,339 --> 02:14:28,769
[SPEAKER_11]: maybe you weren't, so you can't speak to them, but it just, it's not, it doesn't seem to me that there was enough of a justification there to make this switch.

1355
02:14:28,990 --> 02:14:30,671
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's what I'm not really understanding.

1356
02:14:31,957 --> 02:14:36,819
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I think we really haven't talked about what Cataldo offered, what Cataldo brought to the table.

1357
02:14:37,240 --> 02:14:42,022
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we didn't, we exactly did not blow up a 25-year relationship.

1358
02:14:42,062 --> 02:14:45,544
[SPEAKER_14]: We continued negotiations with both parties.

1359
02:14:45,644 --> 02:14:47,124
[SPEAKER_14]: That's exactly what we didn't do.

1360
02:14:48,065 --> 02:14:56,369
[SPEAKER_14]: Despite everything, we continued to negotiate with both parties and in good faith to identify what the best would be for the city of Medford.

1361
02:14:56,829 --> 02:14:58,030
[SPEAKER_14]: And Cataldo rose to the top.

1362
02:15:02,243 --> 02:15:12,687
[SPEAKER_11]: The switching cost thing though, so if Armstrong comes back in another three years and they offer a better deal than Cataldo, are you gonna do the switch back again?

1363
02:15:12,707 --> 02:15:18,410
[SPEAKER_11]: There's definitely a switching cost and something to be said with a lot of experience in the area.

1364
02:15:19,830 --> 02:15:26,113
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of what the EMSs were saying at the last meeting also did concern me about the fact that Cataldo

1365
02:15:27,012 --> 02:15:29,435
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to go back to the slide that I was looking at.

1366
02:15:40,873 --> 02:16:00,530
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, I do understand if there are benefits, there are like, you know, sort of things to make one deal better than the other, but still the switch, it does strike me that that will end up destabilizing things for a while, and I understand that we had a conversation about that earlier in the meeting.

1367
02:16:01,171 --> 02:16:05,675
[SPEAKER_11]: Regardless, we are getting into a back and forth here, and I want to respect everybody's time, I see that.

1368
02:16:06,737 --> 02:16:10,541
[SPEAKER_11]: My colleague also wants to speak and that's, that's all I have to say.

1369
02:16:13,123 --> 02:16:24,114
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure, and I, I certainly defer to Chief Buckley because, you know, Chief Buckley has been involved to, to a degree, was out on leave and I did find an invoice in my email to which Chief Buckley is not on.

1370
02:16:24,595 --> 02:16:29,579
[SPEAKER_14]: But I will say I think, I think the reality is

1371
02:16:30,892 --> 02:16:39,377
[SPEAKER_14]: The city needed to consider all options, considering everything that had transpired over the course of the last year plus with the contract.

1372
02:16:40,298 --> 02:16:50,564
[SPEAKER_14]: To say that the city should remain with a contractor that the city is not happy with, is not getting responsive information from, is not getting

1373
02:16:51,865 --> 02:17:02,552
[SPEAKER_14]: responses from in terms of callback time is not is, is, is having to push significantly on payments, even after documentation is provided, whether it's the financial statements or otherwise.

1374
02:17:02,952 --> 02:17:07,455
[SPEAKER_14]: And then coming back and looking at data that's not being provided.

1375
02:17:07,475 --> 02:17:13,359
[SPEAKER_14]: There's just a, there's just a history, and I, I, I honestly, I'm surprised to a degree that

1376
02:17:15,268 --> 02:17:22,611
[SPEAKER_14]: that the work that was done by the city is not being heard and captured here.

1377
02:17:22,691 --> 02:17:40,917
[SPEAKER_14]: It seems that each and every time we're describing what happened in the past, there's some speculation on what Armstrong might have done or might not have done by the council, and I'm just, I'm feeling kind of,

1378
02:17:43,714 --> 02:17:57,040
[SPEAKER_14]: I feel like I'm put in a position where I'm having to repeat myself kind of as a broken record, or others on the team are having to repeat themselves kind of as a broken record, and enough weight is not being given to what the city is saying in these cases.

1379
02:17:59,521 --> 02:18:01,122
[SPEAKER_05]: Chief Buckley, just a specific question.

1380
02:18:02,723 --> 02:18:06,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's just go back to that first piece of the payments.

1381
02:18:09,273 --> 02:18:11,715
[SPEAKER_05]: You were having the conversation, you said, Armstrong, we want these payments.

1382
02:18:12,396 --> 02:18:15,539
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you said that, Armstrong said, we're not going to pay at all.

1383
02:18:15,619 --> 02:18:17,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Was that, and you were on leave at the time, I think, right?

1384
02:18:17,922 --> 02:18:18,142
[SPEAKER_05]: So.

1385
02:18:18,823 --> 02:18:20,504
[SPEAKER_05]: When they said they weren't paying?

1386
02:18:21,265 --> 02:18:21,525
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1387
02:18:21,906 --> 02:18:22,806
[SPEAKER_13]: No, that was in my office.

1388
02:18:23,147 --> 02:18:23,747
[SPEAKER_05]: When was that?

1389
02:18:24,308 --> 02:18:25,129
[SPEAKER_13]: In March, end of March.

1390
02:18:25,149 --> 02:18:25,629
[SPEAKER_05]: That was in March.

1391
02:18:25,669 --> 02:18:26,790
[SPEAKER_05]: So you were here for that.

1392
02:18:26,830 --> 02:18:26,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1393
02:18:27,551 --> 02:18:27,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1394
02:18:27,731 --> 02:18:34,815
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was a verbal conversation in March where they said we're not paying, period, not on any conditional element.

1395
02:18:35,396 --> 02:18:37,517
[SPEAKER_05]: And was that further substantiated like in writing?

1396
02:18:37,557 --> 02:18:39,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Was there a request made in writing and they said we're not paying?

1397
02:18:39,838 --> 02:18:42,159
[SPEAKER_05]: Or when a request was made in writing, was the response different?

1398
02:18:42,480 --> 02:18:43,080
[SPEAKER_13]: Not to me, no.

1399
02:18:43,400 --> 02:18:43,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Not to you.

1400
02:18:43,900 --> 02:18:46,462
[SPEAKER_05]: To the mayor or the city when a further request was made?

1401
02:18:46,762 --> 02:18:50,985
[SPEAKER_13]: may have, I believe at the time, and I just want, also it gives me an opportunity to clarify something.

1402
02:18:51,126 --> 02:18:52,827
[SPEAKER_13]: We keep referring to this as a bad meeting.

1403
02:18:53,327 --> 02:18:54,248
[SPEAKER_13]: We had no bad meeting.

1404
02:18:54,388 --> 02:18:56,530
[SPEAKER_13]: There was no anger or tempers in this meeting.

1405
02:18:56,570 --> 02:18:59,372
[SPEAKER_13]: It was just straightforward business.

1406
02:19:01,153 --> 02:19:09,280
[SPEAKER_13]: They knew we were going to be seeking some sort of reimbursements for funds for work in the Dispatch Center, and they said that, quite frankly, they weren't gonna make the payments.

1407
02:19:09,360 --> 02:19:14,204
[SPEAKER_13]: They were getting legal advice not to make the payments, and they were getting legal advice that they had to charge additional

1408
02:19:15,184 --> 02:19:19,426
[SPEAKER_13]: From there, they were directed back towards the mayor who negotiates that contract.

1409
02:19:19,726 --> 02:19:23,328
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I'm not saying we were like, here's what it is, but we're like, okay.

1410
02:19:23,528 --> 02:19:24,909
[SPEAKER_13]: Kind of took me by surprise, but.

1411
02:19:26,229 --> 02:19:31,072
[SPEAKER_05]: So after that point, the further conversations were with the mayor and the chief of staff in KP Law?

1412
02:19:32,472 --> 02:19:34,193
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to assume they directly paid.

1413
02:19:34,233 --> 02:19:35,814
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know, the chief of staff maybe could.

1414
02:19:36,872 --> 02:19:38,693
[SPEAKER_14]: I wasn't involved in, in the direct conversations.

1415
02:19:38,713 --> 02:19:39,394
[SPEAKER_14]: Who was?

1416
02:19:39,414 --> 02:19:52,242
[SPEAKER_14]: I know, I know, well, I, I don't know which each, each meeting who was involved indirectly, but I know that the negotiating team consisted of our chief when he was on, and when he wasn't on leave.

1417
02:19:52,962 --> 02:19:59,506
[SPEAKER_14]: Our fire chief, our supervisor of dispatch, Mike Salve, our former city solicitor, and the mayor.

1418
02:19:59,526 --> 02:20:01,047
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, I'm just wondering who was having the.

1419
02:20:01,067 --> 02:20:03,428
[SPEAKER_14]: And then AP Law to a degree was on at some point as well.

1420
02:20:03,749 --> 02:20:05,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Who was having the conversations about the payments?

1421
02:20:06,832 --> 02:20:11,753
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe our finance director was communicating at some point with Armstrong on the payments, yes.

1422
02:20:12,013 --> 02:20:13,374
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, just the finance director?

1423
02:20:14,234 --> 02:20:25,937
[SPEAKER_14]: There's communications that are in my inbox, but, you know, I wasn't leading that one, so I, but there's plenty of people on those communications, but the communications, from what I can tell, are back and forth between the finance director and Armstrong.

1424
02:20:25,957 --> 02:20:28,878
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just trying to figure out how we got from, we won't pay a dime,

1425
02:20:29,885 --> 02:20:48,352
[SPEAKER_05]: with some people to we'll give you some money now with other people to we're going to give you a bunch of this money now and like who was involved in each of those conversations and if there was any sort of legal change either on the city side or on Armstrong side since it was brought up that they were getting legal advice that they shouldn't pay and then they did pay which would.

1426
02:20:49,252 --> 02:21:00,459
[SPEAKER_05]: I would reasonably assume means that the legal advice had changed or, so I'm just trying to wonder, lawyers seem to be involved, finance director was involved, how did we get from we're not giving you a dime to we've given you three quarters of the money?

1427
02:21:00,679 --> 02:21:01,620
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my overall question.

1428
02:21:01,640 --> 02:21:05,802
[SPEAKER_14]: My understanding is the city put it squarely in their lap that they needed to make the payments.

1429
02:21:06,202 --> 02:21:06,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1430
02:21:06,482 --> 02:21:08,904
[SPEAKER_14]: And kept doing so and kept pushing for that.

1431
02:21:09,344 --> 02:21:09,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1432
02:21:09,544 --> 02:21:10,945
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1433
02:21:11,345 --> 02:21:12,186
[SPEAKER_14]: It's as simple as that.

1434
02:21:13,146 --> 02:21:14,007
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, Councilor Scarpelli.

1435
02:21:16,063 --> 02:21:25,709
[SPEAKER_09]: You brought up some issues, one that we know at the end, you weren't involved, the chiefs weren't involved, Mr. Salve wasn't involved in the end of negotiations.

1436
02:21:26,249 --> 02:21:31,413
[SPEAKER_09]: This is why I reached out and said, please, have one more meeting face-to-face with all the parties.

1437
02:21:31,873 --> 02:21:34,034
[SPEAKER_09]: Because isn't that what negotiations are?

1438
02:21:34,514 --> 02:21:36,716
[SPEAKER_09]: I applaud the mayor to go get someone else to start it.

1439
02:21:37,476 --> 02:21:43,360
[SPEAKER_09]: But when I have a municipal contract and someone comes to me and says, well, this is what we want for a bus contract.

1440
02:21:45,245 --> 02:21:47,426
[SPEAKER_09]: lunch program contract, and I talked to a vendor.

1441
02:21:48,106 --> 02:21:51,287
[SPEAKER_09]: We go back and forth so we can get the best number.

1442
02:21:51,647 --> 02:21:52,647
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't that negotiation?

1443
02:21:53,607 --> 02:21:53,907
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

1444
02:21:54,548 --> 02:22:00,329
[SPEAKER_09]: Ultimately, there wasn't an issue for 25 years when it comes to service with this company.

1445
02:22:00,749 --> 02:22:07,111
[SPEAKER_09]: It only comes up now because there are questions about moving from this company because of concerns.

1446
02:22:08,512 --> 02:22:13,313
[SPEAKER_09]: You explain that Cataldo, you don't know what they offered.

1447
02:22:14,139 --> 02:22:19,863
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, what was shared to the community, because no one's seen the contract, I haven't seen the contract, we have three things.

1448
02:22:20,864 --> 02:22:30,091
[SPEAKER_09]: The behavior ambulance, which I shared with everybody with Armstrong, shared with me, that they're willing to do that, they will do that, even if it was the 13th hour.

1449
02:22:32,012 --> 02:22:43,401
[SPEAKER_09]: That the coverage for ambulance service for employees, what was shared to me was just needed to be in the contract

1450
02:22:44,730 --> 02:22:47,733
[SPEAKER_09]: and spelt out in the contract correctly, and they would honor that.

1451
02:22:48,513 --> 02:22:57,661
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I believe the third piece was the, I forgot what the mass press release at the time, but there were three issues.

1452
02:22:58,421 --> 02:23:02,785
[SPEAKER_09]: And at the time when I read those, I said, that's exactly why we needed this conversation.

1453
02:23:04,887 --> 02:23:10,952
[SPEAKER_09]: And then Madam Chief of Staff, I don't know if you realize this, sometimes when you come up here,

1454
02:23:12,441 --> 02:23:16,284
[SPEAKER_09]: and you share how you feel, that it seems condescending.

1455
02:23:16,765 --> 02:23:24,971
[SPEAKER_09]: Could it be that maybe when we keep saying the same thing back to you, or the message doesn't align with you, but maybe you're not right?

1456
02:23:26,212 --> 02:23:32,237
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe that we should look at the totality of what this issue is and say, well, maybe we should have handled this differently.

1457
02:23:32,978 --> 02:23:41,205
[SPEAKER_09]: Because what's alarming to me right now, as we're talking the contract, the people that were directly involved at the end of that contract,

1458
02:23:42,722 --> 02:23:43,263
[SPEAKER_09]: aren't here.

1459
02:23:44,744 --> 02:23:46,146
[SPEAKER_09]: We know the chiefs weren't involved.

1460
02:23:46,186 --> 02:23:47,707
[SPEAKER_09]: We know Mr. Salvi was involved.

1461
02:23:47,967 --> 02:23:49,169
[SPEAKER_09]: We know you weren't involved.

1462
02:23:49,469 --> 02:23:59,059
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know the mayor wasn't involved from what I was told, that it was KP Law, our chief of staff, with Armstrong's attorneys in Armstrong.

1463
02:24:00,400 --> 02:24:02,042
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a documentation that was shared.

1464
02:24:03,208 --> 02:24:19,824
[SPEAKER_09]: I can share the documentation that was shared through the city solicitor at the time that when he reviewed the breakdown of the money and how they were going to additionally legally incorporate that money that Medford still wanted and Armstrong said we will break it down this way.

1465
02:24:20,364 --> 02:24:28,211
[SPEAKER_09]: So we will honor that even though they didn't get the information that was required in the original contract on section 10 one.

1466
02:24:30,770 --> 02:24:36,194
[SPEAKER_09]: The city solicitor, as Mr. Raymond said last week, the city solicitor said, it's perfect.

1467
02:24:36,254 --> 02:24:36,954
[SPEAKER_09]: Everything looks great.

1468
02:24:37,495 --> 02:24:38,555
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe it was in June.

1469
02:24:39,356 --> 02:24:40,036
[SPEAKER_09]: Everything looks great.

1470
02:24:40,076 --> 02:24:44,039
[SPEAKER_09]: The mayor's going to give it a once over, and we'll get back to you when we can move forward.

1471
02:24:45,600 --> 02:24:46,601
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what was done.

1472
02:24:47,922 --> 02:24:48,702
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what was done.

1473
02:24:50,103 --> 02:24:51,064
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what we heard.

1474
02:24:51,124 --> 02:24:54,106
[SPEAKER_09]: This is what we see in documents and emails that has been shared to us.

1475
02:24:55,447 --> 02:24:56,728
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I'm the city councilor.

1476
02:24:57,942 --> 02:24:59,783
[SPEAKER_09]: And I see this paperwork.

1477
02:25:00,144 --> 02:25:07,248
[SPEAKER_09]: So when you say, it seems like I have to say things over and over again, because you didn't see this, obviously.

1478
02:25:08,109 --> 02:25:08,469
[SPEAKER_09]: I did.

1479
02:25:09,850 --> 02:25:11,191
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is what it's concerning.

1480
02:25:11,691 --> 02:25:20,417
[SPEAKER_09]: When it comes down to it, we have a company for over 25 years that have had zero issues at least with each other.

1481
02:25:20,477 --> 02:25:21,198
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been worked out.

1482
02:25:21,938 --> 02:25:23,980
[SPEAKER_09]: We haven't had one serious complaint in this community.

1483
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,001
[SPEAKER_09]: As a matter of fact, you'll hear later opposite.

1484
02:25:27,861 --> 02:25:39,270
[SPEAKER_09]: Because what I've gotten from phone calls and communications from multiple people in the community that what this company does that's not being shown in a contract would knock you off your chair.

1485
02:25:40,290 --> 02:25:43,173
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe take a deep breath and say, you know what?

1486
02:25:46,015 --> 02:25:46,635
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe that's true.

1487
02:25:47,336 --> 02:25:55,002
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we should have sat down as part of what negotiation, definition of negotiation, is bring the parties together after you get it, right?

1488
02:25:55,262 --> 02:25:56,523
[SPEAKER_09]: Those people that follow the Red Sox.

1489
02:25:57,472 --> 02:26:00,935
[SPEAKER_09]: Alex Bregman was going back and forth while Chicago Cubs gave him a better deal.

1490
02:26:01,556 --> 02:26:02,236
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, he's gone now.

1491
02:26:03,457 --> 02:26:05,419
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, at least they went to the Red Sox and said, what is it?

1492
02:26:05,739 --> 02:26:06,300
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you do this?

1493
02:26:06,320 --> 02:26:09,482
[SPEAKER_09]: And the Red Sox said, no, we're not going to give you a no trade clause.

1494
02:26:09,963 --> 02:26:10,904
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not going to put that in.

1495
02:26:11,604 --> 02:26:12,265
[SPEAKER_09]: It's no different.

1496
02:26:12,785 --> 02:26:16,689
[SPEAKER_09]: So for people that don't understand contracts, that's something that's been in the news lately.

1497
02:26:17,569 --> 02:26:18,590
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all I asked for.

1498
02:26:18,610 --> 02:26:21,272
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all I asked for the 13th hour.

1499
02:26:21,312 --> 02:26:21,733
[SPEAKER_09]: Please come.

1500
02:26:21,773 --> 02:26:22,834
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody sit back at the table.

1501
02:26:23,114 --> 02:26:24,095
[SPEAKER_09]: We wouldn't be here right now.

1502
02:26:25,371 --> 02:26:28,292
[SPEAKER_09]: We'd be working on a behavior ambulance based in Medford.

1503
02:26:28,653 --> 02:26:35,896
[SPEAKER_09]: We'd be working on the EMT training that was explained to me by the leadership team and why this wasn't happening in Medford.

1504
02:26:36,216 --> 02:26:47,522
[SPEAKER_09]: We would clarify and clean up the certain issues, but instead we got information on samplings of questionable response times.

1505
02:26:48,547 --> 02:26:54,914
[SPEAKER_09]: where the data that came from Armstrong showed us concrete state guidelines and response times.

1506
02:26:55,614 --> 02:27:00,699
[SPEAKER_09]: So when you talk about response times and now we talk about contracts, it just doesn't equate.

1507
02:27:01,380 --> 02:27:01,921
[SPEAKER_09]: It just doesn't.

1508
02:27:02,621 --> 02:27:03,703
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you, Mr. President.

1509
02:27:04,984 --> 02:27:05,324
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1510
02:27:08,605 --> 02:27:12,266
[SPEAKER_05]: So I want to transition at a certain point to hearing from Armstrong.

1511
02:27:12,947 --> 02:27:14,627
[SPEAKER_05]: As I said, there were like five steps to this meeting.

1512
02:27:14,647 --> 02:27:15,808
[SPEAKER_05]: We're still in step one.

1513
02:27:15,828 --> 02:27:19,309
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'd like us to get out of here at a reasonable hour.

1514
02:27:21,770 --> 02:27:27,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything more that we want to hear from the administration at this point or questions from the council for the administration?

1515
02:27:30,358 --> 02:27:35,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a programming note, I know we had the standard compensation ordinance on the agenda.

1516
02:27:35,982 --> 02:27:41,987
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to, we're not going to, I'm the proponent, I would request a motion to table that to a future committee of the whole meeting.

1517
02:27:42,647 --> 02:27:44,148
[SPEAKER_05]: Can anyone make that motion?

1518
02:27:44,408 --> 02:27:46,870
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know there are people from the administration here to discuss that.

1519
02:27:48,876 --> 02:27:51,757
[SPEAKER_05]: But I would request a motion on that item if that's possible.

1520
02:27:52,537 --> 02:27:53,137
[SPEAKER_05]: So moved, Mr. President.

1521
02:27:53,157 --> 02:27:57,679
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a motion by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Malauulu.

1522
02:27:58,179 --> 02:27:59,219
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1523
02:27:59,239 --> 02:28:02,160
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the table 25189 to a future committee of the whole meeting.

1524
02:28:05,441 --> 02:28:09,322
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're here to talk about standard compensation ordinance, we'll see you in February.

1525
02:28:12,784 --> 02:28:13,724
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Callahan.

1526
02:28:13,744 --> 02:28:14,404
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1527
02:28:16,225 --> 02:28:17,285
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Lazzaro.

1528
02:28:20,753 --> 02:28:21,013
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1529
02:28:23,015 --> 02:28:23,655
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Leming?

1530
02:28:23,675 --> 02:28:25,557
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1531
02:28:25,577 --> 02:28:26,197
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Malay?

1532
02:28:26,217 --> 02:28:26,277
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1533
02:28:27,738 --> 02:28:28,619
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1534
02:28:28,799 --> 02:28:29,039
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1535
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:30,740
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Tseng?

1536
02:28:31,081 --> 02:28:31,341
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1537
02:28:32,502 --> 02:28:32,982
[SPEAKER_10]: President Pierce?

1538
02:28:33,466 --> 02:28:35,889
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, 70 in favor of none, the negative motion passes.

1539
02:28:37,051 --> 02:28:45,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Before we wrap up, I just wanted to go over just so I understand or if you want to respond, if you want to say something now about what was just said, that's fine.

1540
02:28:46,363 --> 02:28:49,948
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to go over kind of my understanding of the analysis at this point.

1541
02:28:51,409 --> 02:28:51,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Your call.

1542
02:28:52,065 --> 02:28:53,086
[SPEAKER_14]: No, go ahead, President Bears.

1543
02:28:53,146 --> 02:29:01,391
[SPEAKER_14]: I really don't have any more that I can say here, because I've said everything I needed to say, and we've made it very clear what the city's perspective on this is.

1544
02:29:01,491 --> 02:29:07,754
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think it's just, I think the exact opposite of, I think, Councilor Scarapelli.

1545
02:29:07,794 --> 02:29:18,301
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think that the comments that are being presented by the professionals of the city who are here today, who looked at these contracts, are being minimized.

1546
02:29:19,401 --> 02:29:19,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Got it.

1547
02:29:19,801 --> 02:29:20,122
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1548
02:29:21,628 --> 02:29:31,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so my understanding where we're at, I picked up six general areas of kind of the, we talked about last week the analysis of how the city got to this decision.

1549
02:29:32,330 --> 02:29:38,011
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of them was that around the response times and that questioning the validity of Armstrong's data.

1550
02:29:38,051 --> 02:29:44,753
[SPEAKER_05]: That was kind of one bucket that response times were getting longer, that trucks were in Arlington a lot.

1551
02:29:46,025 --> 02:29:51,306
[SPEAKER_05]: felt that there were discrepancies in the data, inaccurate data, loss of trust in the data that the city was receiving from Armstrong.

1552
02:29:51,346 --> 02:29:52,427
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the first bucket.

1553
02:29:53,567 --> 02:30:09,431
[SPEAKER_05]: The second bucket was kind of around investment, that there was a lack of investment in staff, trucks, AEDs, going back to that coverage issue that ALS was in Arlington a lot, asking why not more resources were not added.

1554
02:30:11,331 --> 02:30:13,652
[SPEAKER_05]: And then some questions around Armstrong,

1555
02:30:14,095 --> 02:30:17,696
[SPEAKER_05]: not offering things that they'd offered in the past or Cataldo offering better benefits.

1556
02:30:18,936 --> 02:30:40,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Armstrong wouldn't do free transport of first responders to if they were in a health area and then the Cataldo was offering EMT training at the high school, firefighter training, EMT training for firefighters, extra equipment and training for fire department or extra equipment at fire scenes and extra training operations.

1557
02:30:41,963 --> 02:30:47,607
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the last one was around these payments that Armstrong was refusing to pay, things that were in the contract.

1558
02:30:47,687 --> 02:30:55,654
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think for me, is that generally a summary of where you guys were at?

1559
02:30:56,594 --> 02:30:57,735
[SPEAKER_14]: I think you covered the points, yeah.

1560
02:30:58,156 --> 02:30:58,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1561
02:31:01,418 --> 02:31:09,524
[SPEAKER_05]: My questions remain here, mainly around the data and the response times, like I really,

1562
02:31:10,313 --> 02:31:17,156
[SPEAKER_05]: would like to see reports from the city, as well as reports from Armstrong around, I think we got a lot of data by anecdote.

1563
02:31:17,216 --> 02:31:25,899
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we heard there were many incidents of long response times, but going back to that question that I asked, you know, how has average response time been changing over time?

1564
02:31:26,319 --> 02:31:28,860
[SPEAKER_05]: What proportion of responses were greater than 10 minutes?

1565
02:31:28,920 --> 02:31:35,443
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of these bigger questions that would, I think, make it a lot easier for the average person to understand that response times were getting worse.

1566
02:31:35,563 --> 02:31:39,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that would be kind of more what I would want to see there.

1567
02:31:40,519 --> 02:31:46,502
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I have questions on the payments still, like I still don't understand how we got from we're not paying at all to we'll definitely pay.

1568
02:31:47,262 --> 02:32:03,651
[SPEAKER_05]: And just looking at the, what Councilor Scarpelli just passed to me, you know, it looks like in the 2012 contract and the first three years of the 2017 contract, like payments were made in a very timely way each year, each fiscal year.

1569
02:32:05,251 --> 02:32:06,132
[SPEAKER_05]: And then starting in 2020,

1570
02:32:09,374 --> 02:32:11,576
[SPEAKER_05]: no longer payments were no longer being made.

1571
02:32:11,756 --> 02:32:20,924
[SPEAKER_05]: Armstrong says there was no request from the city to Armstrong for these payments in 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024.

1572
02:32:21,504 --> 02:32:28,650
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's very different from the behavior prior to 2020.

1573
02:32:30,111 --> 02:32:35,415
[SPEAKER_05]: And to be honest, like I think just as much as we can say, it's disingenuous to say, well, we didn't invoice them so they shouldn't pay.

1574
02:32:35,996 --> 02:32:38,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Like if I got asked to pay back

1575
02:32:39,071 --> 02:32:50,884
[SPEAKER_05]: years of payments over two contracts in the beginning of the year when my contract was up, and then contract negotiations were part of that discussion, like, that's just as questionable to me as pointing in the other direction.

1576
02:32:51,205 --> 02:32:58,193
[SPEAKER_05]: So my questions still are, the why on the response times and the data and the why on the payments.

1577
02:33:00,685 --> 02:33:02,666
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just still, I just still have questions about that.

1578
02:33:02,806 --> 02:33:05,146
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think they're reasonable questions.

1579
02:33:05,507 --> 02:33:09,128
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think they're representing that I'm not hearing you guys.

1580
02:33:09,148 --> 02:33:10,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I'm hearing what you're saying.

1581
02:33:10,308 --> 02:33:11,849
[SPEAKER_05]: I just, those questions haven't been answered.

1582
02:33:12,069 --> 02:33:15,890
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's where I'm at on all of it.

1583
02:33:17,417 --> 02:33:21,861
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, at this point, you know, if you want to respond, and then we can move to the next phase of the.

1584
02:33:21,881 --> 02:33:22,882
[SPEAKER_14]: Just to say one more thing.

1585
02:33:23,002 --> 02:33:23,703
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, President Bezos.

1586
02:33:23,743 --> 02:33:24,563
[SPEAKER_14]: Just to say one more thing.

1587
02:33:25,244 --> 02:33:40,297
[SPEAKER_14]: In March of 2025, when the chief is hearing from Armstrong that they are not going to honor certain aspects of the contract, they're going to change certain terms that have either been part of the contract or pre-log standing practices.

1588
02:33:42,338 --> 02:33:49,507
[SPEAKER_14]: That's at a point where, of course, we've got a negotiation coming up this November.

1589
02:33:51,664 --> 02:33:54,265
[SPEAKER_14]: is a very difficult way to start a negotiation.

1590
02:33:54,745 --> 02:34:07,368
[SPEAKER_14]: So one thing that wasn't said was if this is, sitting back and looking at this from the city's perspective, if this is the tenor of the contractor in March, what should we expect in November?

1591
02:34:07,448 --> 02:34:16,610
[SPEAKER_14]: And really the only way to hold a contractor responsible for something like that when they're changing terms of the contract, changing past practices is to

1592
02:34:17,763 --> 02:34:21,465
[SPEAKER_14]: bring in other parties to negotiate with to get the best for the city.

1593
02:34:21,825 --> 02:34:22,466
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's what we did.

1594
02:34:22,746 --> 02:34:24,407
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think that was just the only thing that wasn't said.

1595
02:34:24,467 --> 02:34:30,330
[SPEAKER_14]: That doesn't necessarily speak to the items you're talking about, but I think that needed to be said as well.

1596
02:34:31,191 --> 02:34:31,731
[SPEAKER_05]: And I appreciate it.

1597
02:34:31,751 --> 02:34:33,352
[SPEAKER_05]: And just a really quick clarifying question.

1598
02:34:33,372 --> 02:34:40,576
[SPEAKER_05]: When you say not honor the terms of the contract, part of what you're saying is they weren't gonna make the payment.

1599
02:34:40,596 --> 02:34:42,498
[SPEAKER_05]: They said they weren't gonna make the payment.

1600
02:34:43,723 --> 02:34:49,624
[SPEAKER_05]: You're saying they said they wouldn't make the payments that were in the current contract.

1601
02:34:49,764 --> 02:34:52,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Was the rest of that about the current contract or the future contract?

1602
02:34:54,966 --> 02:34:56,366
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I'm following your question correctly.

1603
02:34:56,386 --> 02:34:58,686
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I'm saying, like, you said they weren't going to honor the contract.

1604
02:34:58,706 --> 02:35:00,627
[SPEAKER_14]: Their current contract.

1605
02:35:00,707 --> 02:35:03,387
[SPEAKER_14]: And therefore, what would happen in future contracts?

1606
02:35:03,467 --> 02:35:03,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1607
02:35:03,667 --> 02:35:05,908
[SPEAKER_05]: What provisions weren't they going to honor of the current contract?

1608
02:35:06,431 --> 02:35:07,672
[SPEAKER_14]: The reimbursement provisions.

1609
02:35:07,712 --> 02:35:09,574
[SPEAKER_05]: That, okay.

1610
02:35:09,594 --> 02:35:10,454
[SPEAKER_14]: The 75K per year.

1611
02:35:10,594 --> 02:35:11,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else?

1612
02:35:11,615 --> 02:35:13,877
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, the EMD, in March.

1613
02:35:14,297 --> 02:35:14,418
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1614
02:35:14,438 --> 02:35:14,918
[SPEAKER_14]: We covered this.

1615
02:35:15,238 --> 02:35:24,706
[SPEAKER_14]: In March of 2025, they essentially went, they said that they wouldn't cover three specific things that were either in the contract or past practices.

1616
02:35:25,366 --> 02:35:28,489
[SPEAKER_14]: The first was the $75,000 per year.

1617
02:35:28,969 --> 02:35:32,672
[SPEAKER_14]: The second was the EMD.

1618
02:35:32,712 --> 02:35:34,954
[SPEAKER_14]: They were going to begin charging the city for EMD.

1619
02:35:34,994 --> 02:35:35,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Right away.

1620
02:35:37,165 --> 02:35:38,846
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't, I can't speak to that specifically.

1621
02:35:38,907 --> 02:35:46,952
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I'm just trying to figure out which of these was in the next contract we would like to change this or in this current contract it says this and we're not going to do this.

1622
02:35:47,192 --> 02:35:48,453
[SPEAKER_14]: That one I'd have to defer to others.

1623
02:35:48,593 --> 02:35:49,414
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1624
02:35:50,194 --> 02:35:55,918
[SPEAKER_14]: And then that they were going to stop providing services to our first responders when they were injured in the line of duty.

1625
02:35:56,118 --> 02:35:58,220
[SPEAKER_05]: And was that right away as well or in the future contract?

1626
02:35:58,240 --> 02:35:59,180
[SPEAKER_14]: That I don't have the answer to.

1627
02:35:59,200 --> 02:35:59,761
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1628
02:36:00,281 --> 02:36:01,882
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love the answer to those two questions.

1629
02:36:01,942 --> 02:36:04,324
[SPEAKER_14]: Chief right away or in the future, do you know?

1630
02:36:10,408 --> 02:36:25,634
[SPEAKER_05]: My question was that Nina just said, the Chief of Staff just said there were three things that Armstrong said they wouldn't do anymore and it was, or provisions of the contract that as the Chief of Staff characterized that Armstrong wouldn't honor.

1631
02:36:26,374 --> 02:36:37,379
[SPEAKER_05]: One was the payments, the $75,000 payments, and then the other two were that they were going to start charging the city for EMD and that they were no longer going to transport first responders free of charge.

1632
02:36:38,119 --> 02:36:46,062
[SPEAKER_05]: were those things that were going to, those second two things, were those, we're not gonna do that from this date forward, or in the next contract we want something different?

1633
02:36:46,422 --> 02:36:49,103
[SPEAKER_13]: It's my belief that there was, from that date forward.

1634
02:36:49,383 --> 02:36:51,443
[SPEAKER_05]: From that date forward, and did that actually happen?

1635
02:36:52,444 --> 02:36:52,604
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

1636
02:36:53,084 --> 02:36:55,365
[SPEAKER_05]: So they didn't charge for EMD and they kept transferring?

1637
02:36:55,385 --> 02:37:04,988
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't believe the situation came up as far as transporting an employee, so wouldn't have been able to be tested, and then you get the SO.

1638
02:37:05,308 --> 02:37:06,028
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I don't think so.

1639
02:37:06,688 --> 02:37:09,289
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so they didn't charge us for EMD from that point?

1640
02:37:09,850 --> 02:37:10,150
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.

1641
02:37:10,650 --> 02:37:17,894
[SPEAKER_05]: And it didn't come up, but did they ever communicate in writing, we will not transport a first responder, we will charge you for that from here on?

1642
02:37:19,415 --> 02:37:20,995
[SPEAKER_13]: Did they ever follow up and put that in writing?

1643
02:37:21,255 --> 02:37:25,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, did they say, from here on out, if our first responders entered, we're charging you for their transportation?

1644
02:37:25,658 --> 02:37:25,698
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1645
02:37:25,718 --> 02:37:26,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you.

1646
02:37:26,338 --> 02:37:29,059
[SPEAKER_13]: Not to me anyway, if that's the question, yeah.

1647
02:37:29,120 --> 02:37:29,980
[SPEAKER_05]: To anyone in the city?

1648
02:37:32,201 --> 02:37:32,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Did they?

1649
02:37:32,521 --> 02:37:35,063
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if they did it to anyone else in the city.

1650
02:37:35,083 --> 02:37:35,703
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you.

1651
02:37:36,646 --> 02:37:38,888
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, looks like we got two more.

1652
02:37:38,908 --> 02:37:42,371
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll go to Councilor Leming, Councilor Scarpelli, and we'll move to step two.

1653
02:37:43,712 --> 02:37:52,899
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I just wanted to thank you and Chiefs Todd and Evans for speaking here tonight.

1654
02:37:54,681 --> 02:38:01,646
[SPEAKER_11]: I would like to reiterate once again that I appreciate this kind of a conversation, difficult as it is, far more than

1655
02:38:03,265 --> 02:38:17,530
[SPEAKER_11]: what we saw previously, which was, well, I just appreciate honesty and transparency about what happened behind the scenes coming from the administration.

1656
02:38:17,570 --> 02:38:23,632
[SPEAKER_11]: I understand it's very difficult to stand and have this back and forth for two and a half hours.

1657
02:38:23,732 --> 02:38:25,193
[SPEAKER_11]: I can appreciate that.

1658
02:38:27,093 --> 02:38:37,035
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to say that, and I do, but also to say that I do agree that we should move on to hear from Armstrong as well.

1659
02:38:37,295 --> 02:38:37,655
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1660
02:38:38,835 --> 02:38:39,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1661
02:38:39,315 --> 02:38:39,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1662
02:38:39,895 --> 02:38:41,275
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1663
02:38:41,316 --> 02:38:47,997
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, I think, again, this is, whether we feel it or not, I think this is a very good format.

1664
02:38:48,197 --> 02:38:51,237
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that this is what people want to see from our government.

1665
02:38:51,297 --> 02:38:55,458
[SPEAKER_09]: So I will explain why this came forward.

1666
02:38:57,487 --> 02:39:04,331
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I said, in communications with the mayor and our chiefs, it seemed like there was a lack, there was a gap there.

1667
02:39:04,871 --> 02:39:06,652
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a link missing in communications.

1668
02:39:07,432 --> 02:39:20,960
[SPEAKER_09]: Because when it came down to the end, I know the chief went through his issues and was off for a period of time, and Chief Evans and Mr. Salve weren't purview to the final discussions and contracts.

1669
02:39:21,667 --> 02:39:32,033
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that what was shared with me and I hope I'm going to ask for clarification from Armstrong about understanding the EMD when it says we want Medford to pay you.

1670
02:39:32,954 --> 02:39:35,695
[SPEAKER_09]: EMD isn't payment out of Medford's pocket.

1671
02:39:36,476 --> 02:39:38,897
[SPEAKER_09]: What I was educated from, from the chief of Stoneham,

1672
02:39:39,410 --> 02:39:55,140
[SPEAKER_09]: was EMD is a process of a 911 grant that is written by our leadership team, whether it's chief of police or chief of fire, and those funds would continue the services of EMD and paid directly to Armstrong.

1673
02:39:55,160 --> 02:39:56,481
[SPEAKER_09]: So I need clarification with that.

1674
02:39:57,802 --> 02:40:03,346
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the other piece of that was understanding the transportation of our firefighters if they were injured.

1675
02:40:04,014 --> 02:40:15,439
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe an understanding at the 12th hour, 13th hour, the understanding was just the language being written in the contract to make sure that it wasn't open-ended to say,

1676
02:40:16,164 --> 02:40:19,025
[SPEAKER_09]: any Medford employee at any time gets an ambulance ride.

1677
02:40:19,405 --> 02:40:25,527
[SPEAKER_09]: That's something that was negotiated with both the KPLR, a solicitor, and Armstrong, from what I've been told.

1678
02:40:26,007 --> 02:40:32,649
[SPEAKER_09]: And then last was the payment of the funds and understanding the processes and why's, where's, and how's.

1679
02:40:33,169 --> 02:40:45,233
[SPEAKER_09]: And even at that hour, there was a solution from Armstrong that shared in the contract that was written and shared with us for 2025 that showed the reimbursement

1680
02:40:45,935 --> 02:40:51,999
[SPEAKER_09]: of what was asked in making sure that Medford is protected by law when you're taking money for services.

1681
02:40:52,439 --> 02:41:02,266
[SPEAKER_09]: And at the same time, Armstrong is protected by state law, I believe it's Medicare, Medicaid processing, making sure they have the documentation so they don't lose their licensure.

1682
02:41:02,666 --> 02:41:09,210
[SPEAKER_09]: So those are the questions that I hope that we'll get from Rich, but I think it's very important that those are the key issues.

1683
02:41:09,270 --> 02:41:13,333
[SPEAKER_09]: And Madam Chief of Staff, and I want to belittle the point, but I'm going to,

1684
02:41:15,032 --> 02:41:18,573
[SPEAKER_09]: If we sat everybody down, it's all a conversation.

1685
02:41:18,833 --> 02:41:25,915
[SPEAKER_09]: It was really part of negotiating where you get the best offer and then you go back and say, here this.

1686
02:41:26,695 --> 02:41:27,495
[SPEAKER_09]: This is what we have.

1687
02:41:27,555 --> 02:41:28,255
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what it's about.

1688
02:41:28,776 --> 02:41:30,056
[SPEAKER_09]: But there's a disconnect somewhere.

1689
02:41:30,816 --> 02:41:37,038
[SPEAKER_09]: And we need to find it because if we're seeing that here now with this contract, where else are we dropping the ball?

1690
02:41:37,058 --> 02:41:38,918
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's something for another date that I'll bring forward.

1691
02:41:39,338 --> 02:41:40,359
[SPEAKER_09]: But thank you, Mr. President.

1692
02:41:44,425 --> 02:41:44,625
[SPEAKER_05]: Good?

1693
02:41:45,266 --> 02:41:45,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.

1694
02:41:45,786 --> 02:41:46,126
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1695
02:41:49,088 --> 02:41:49,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move.

1696
02:41:49,989 --> 02:41:52,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Next step, we will hear from folks from Armstrong.

1697
02:41:52,951 --> 02:41:59,736
[SPEAKER_05]: If there are folks here to represent Armstrong or folks here representing the workers, the union at Armstrong, we'll hear from them next.

1698
02:42:00,736 --> 02:42:03,078
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll go through the same kind of back and forth dialogue.

1699
02:42:03,538 --> 02:42:07,081
[SPEAKER_05]: And then after that, we'll have a public participation.

1700
02:42:07,301 --> 02:42:09,843
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it'd be great if we could hear from

1701
02:42:11,560 --> 02:42:20,017
[SPEAKER_05]: Just any official representatives who want to speak to kind of the main areas that have been laid out or the timeline as they see it at this point.

1702
02:42:25,937 --> 02:42:29,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, and just name and address for the record.

1703
02:42:29,460 --> 02:42:38,307
[SPEAKER_20]: Rich Raymond, CEO of Armstrong Ambulance, but because of the time, for the other folks that want to speak before me, I'm happy to stay, but I feel bad for others that want to speak.

1704
02:42:38,347 --> 02:42:39,548
[SPEAKER_20]: Should I go now or last?

1705
02:42:39,588 --> 02:42:40,289
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm happy to stay.

1706
02:42:40,809 --> 02:42:54,321
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think it would be great to kind of get the case on the table from each side, but, you know, if there's folks, you know, who are burning to speak and can't stay for a little while longer, if you want to raise your hands and,

1707
02:42:56,633 --> 02:42:57,154
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1708
02:42:57,174 --> 02:43:00,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so I think we'll go with you, then we'll hear from everybody else, but.

1709
02:43:00,777 --> 02:43:00,877
[SPEAKER_20]: Great.

1710
02:43:01,297 --> 02:43:02,258
[SPEAKER_20]: So thank, can you hear me?

1711
02:43:02,599 --> 02:43:03,980
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

1712
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:05,061
[SPEAKER_20]: So thank you very much.

1713
02:43:05,081 --> 02:43:20,596
[SPEAKER_20]: I have a timeline that I'll go through, but I know in the beginning tonight we heard a lot of response times of 8 minutes, 9 minutes, 10 minutes, but we didn't hear about the 2 minutes, the 3 minutes, the 4 minutes and all the great things the women and men behind us do, behind me do.

1714
02:43:21,677 --> 02:43:26,319
[SPEAKER_20]: So I feel that their character's being brought into this, and they are wonderful practitioners.

1715
02:43:26,379 --> 02:43:27,539
[SPEAKER_20]: This isn't about the staff.

1716
02:43:28,479 --> 02:43:29,319
[SPEAKER_20]: They respond great.

1717
02:43:29,780 --> 02:43:35,781
[SPEAKER_20]: The national average is nine minutes, so when we talk about six, seven, eight, 859, that's the national average.

1718
02:43:36,342 --> 02:43:41,623
[SPEAKER_20]: So anything above that is where we look at, but anything above that we have to bring into thought.

1719
02:43:41,843 --> 02:43:47,285
[SPEAKER_20]: One of the calls we're talking about was A6 or A7, which means we're contracted for three and a half trucks.

1720
02:43:48,338 --> 02:43:54,120
[SPEAKER_20]: The call in question of 20 or 30 minutes, whatever it was, was the sixth or seventh truck coming into the system.

1721
02:43:55,260 --> 02:44:01,142
[SPEAKER_20]: And by contractual language, it's eight minutes, 59, seven minutes, 59, 90% of the time.

1722
02:44:01,162 --> 02:44:01,682
[SPEAKER_20]: We're well below that.

1723
02:44:05,403 --> 02:44:08,205
[SPEAKER_20]: So we can find longer response times, no doubt.

1724
02:44:08,785 --> 02:44:13,568
[SPEAKER_20]: But there are points that both Chiefs talked about and Mike Salve talked about.

1725
02:44:14,168 --> 02:44:15,189
[SPEAKER_20]: Is it the third truck?

1726
02:44:15,229 --> 02:44:16,150
[SPEAKER_20]: Was it the fourth truck?

1727
02:44:16,710 --> 02:44:23,714
[SPEAKER_20]: And yes, we do move trucks from one truck to another, because if there's a Medford truck at a call, this is where it gets complex.

1728
02:44:23,754 --> 02:44:26,096
[SPEAKER_20]: And I apologize, a lot of people don't understand this.

1729
02:44:26,596 --> 02:44:27,797
[SPEAKER_20]: This is 35 years of knowledge.

1730
02:44:28,537 --> 02:44:29,498
[SPEAKER_20]: If we have a truck here,

1731
02:44:30,392 --> 02:44:37,033
[SPEAKER_20]: in Medford doing a call and it clears up, we will take this truck that cleared up and move it to the current call because it's closer.

1732
02:44:37,553 --> 02:44:40,754
[SPEAKER_20]: Our whole mission is the patient, nothing short of the patient.

1733
02:44:41,254 --> 02:44:43,414
[SPEAKER_20]: We are moving trucks to get the quickest response.

1734
02:44:44,055 --> 02:44:47,235
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's where it gets very complex and people don't understand that.

1735
02:44:47,715 --> 02:44:49,976
[SPEAKER_20]: But there is nobody in Armstrong.

1736
02:44:49,996 --> 02:44:55,677
[SPEAKER_20]: And our director of operations, Shawn Mangan, he lives in town, he grew up in town, he is Medford.

1737
02:44:56,757 --> 02:44:56,877
[SPEAKER_20]: He

1738
02:44:58,621 --> 02:45:00,022
[SPEAKER_20]: wraps Medford around his arms.

1739
02:45:00,082 --> 02:45:05,667
[SPEAKER_20]: There is nothing more sacred to our response than Medford when Sean is part of it, obviously.

1740
02:45:06,187 --> 02:45:08,949
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think that's something that got left out.

1741
02:45:09,510 --> 02:45:13,593
[SPEAKER_20]: Sean keeps a keen eye on all of Armstrong, but he responds to everything.

1742
02:45:13,693 --> 02:45:16,295
[SPEAKER_20]: There are hundreds of calls that we look at.

1743
02:45:16,996 --> 02:45:20,439
[SPEAKER_20]: Our ambulances are tracked by AVL, GPS.

1744
02:45:21,039 --> 02:45:23,901
[SPEAKER_20]: The cameras have, our cameras in the ambulance have GPS.

1745
02:45:24,622 --> 02:45:25,843
[SPEAKER_20]: We record the phone lines.

1746
02:45:25,983 --> 02:45:27,284
[SPEAKER_20]: We record the radio lines.

1747
02:45:28,005 --> 02:45:33,969
[SPEAKER_20]: We know what the response times are and it is well documented and I can pull up as much data as you want.

1748
02:45:34,450 --> 02:45:36,351
[SPEAKER_20]: I will drown you with data but it's complex.

1749
02:45:36,851 --> 02:45:38,393
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm happy to sit and talk with anybody.

1750
02:45:39,413 --> 02:45:42,756
[SPEAKER_20]: But for for tonight do you mind if I just read my timeline.

1751
02:45:43,296 --> 02:45:43,517
[SPEAKER_20]: Sure.

1752
02:45:43,757 --> 02:45:43,817
[SPEAKER_20]: OK.

1753
02:45:49,088 --> 02:45:51,290
[SPEAKER_20]: So, I think the chiefs were correct.

1754
02:45:51,310 --> 02:45:54,892
[SPEAKER_20]: This all started back in March, March 21st actually.

1755
02:45:56,553 --> 02:46:04,839
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, prior to March 21st, Captain Clemente called me and said, hey, we're gonna be doing a project in dispatch.

1756
02:46:04,939 --> 02:46:07,822
[SPEAKER_20]: Mike Salve told me that there's money that we can take from the contract.

1757
02:46:08,422 --> 02:46:16,708
[SPEAKER_20]: I explained to Captain Clemente it's not that easy, that there are some contractual languages that we have to talk about because we can't break the law.

1758
02:46:18,306 --> 02:46:34,637
[SPEAKER_20]: So with that I said can we come down and meet with you and when we got there we came and met with on March 21st we met at Chief Buckley's office with Chief Buckley, Captain Clemente, Chief Evans, Shawn Mangan and myself.

1759
02:46:35,413 --> 02:46:37,594
[SPEAKER_20]: And I was, never no.

1760
02:46:37,854 --> 02:46:40,796
[SPEAKER_20]: It was always about, can we do this legally?

1761
02:46:41,216 --> 02:46:43,357
[SPEAKER_20]: That's the whole, I've never said no.

1762
02:46:43,377 --> 02:46:47,479
[SPEAKER_20]: You ask any of the cities and towns I work with, it's never no, it's how.

1763
02:46:47,579 --> 02:46:50,241
[SPEAKER_20]: So we discussed the how.

1764
02:46:50,381 --> 02:46:55,643
[SPEAKER_20]: So when we talked about getting a $150,000 check, legally, it's the how.

1765
02:46:56,124 --> 02:46:59,885
[SPEAKER_20]: Because from an OIG kickback statute, we need the financials.

1766
02:46:59,946 --> 02:47:01,046
[SPEAKER_20]: No financials were given.

1767
02:47:01,446 --> 02:47:02,787
[SPEAKER_20]: There was a thought of a project.

1768
02:47:03,375 --> 02:47:06,936
[SPEAKER_20]: So then we have to start thinking, all right, how do we get that?

1769
02:47:07,196 --> 02:47:09,277
[SPEAKER_20]: So we talked about, so I kept that in the back of my mind.

1770
02:47:09,317 --> 02:47:19,760
[SPEAKER_20]: Then we talked about transporting, and as we were talking about the $150,000 payment, sorry, then we talked about why the concerns are of the OIG kickback.

1771
02:47:20,660 --> 02:47:22,120
[SPEAKER_20]: So OIG is Medicare.

1772
02:47:22,820 --> 02:47:24,221
[SPEAKER_20]: The kickback statute's pretty,

1773
02:47:26,018 --> 02:47:27,560
[SPEAKER_20]: As you can imagine, it's a legal document.

1774
02:47:27,600 --> 02:47:34,446
[SPEAKER_20]: It's outside of my purview, but we have a lot of attorneys to look at it, a lot of really industry experts.

1775
02:47:35,227 --> 02:47:40,472
[SPEAKER_20]: So we talked about not only the $150,000 or the $75,000 annual.

1776
02:47:41,032 --> 02:47:44,896
[SPEAKER_20]: We talked about, you know, there's some other things that we'd have to talk about is transporting

1777
02:47:46,557 --> 02:47:50,238
[SPEAKER_20]: It should only be police or fires at an incident.

1778
02:47:50,678 --> 02:47:54,839
[SPEAKER_20]: It really can't be a DPW worker who twisted his ankle in the office.

1779
02:47:54,859 --> 02:47:58,080
[SPEAKER_20]: There's very specific language, so it doesn't look like a kickback.

1780
02:47:58,720 --> 02:48:02,741
[SPEAKER_20]: Because if it's a kickback, Armstrong's in trouble as well as the city.

1781
02:48:03,382 --> 02:48:11,804
[SPEAKER_20]: My whole conversation from April to tonight has always been to protect the city and Armstrong, as I do with all of our contracts.

1782
02:48:13,712 --> 02:48:14,973
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's what we talked about.

1783
02:48:15,013 --> 02:48:16,533
[SPEAKER_20]: I was never a no not paying.

1784
02:48:16,953 --> 02:48:20,435
[SPEAKER_20]: We were never a no on transporting patients.

1785
02:48:20,535 --> 02:48:22,636
[SPEAKER_20]: It was always about what's compliance.

1786
02:48:24,276 --> 02:48:29,838
[SPEAKER_20]: So we left that meeting and 10 days later I get an email from a Bob Dickinson.

1787
02:48:30,818 --> 02:48:32,999
[SPEAKER_20]: That's it's an email request $450,000 payable within 10 days.

1788
02:48:36,238 --> 02:48:43,184
[SPEAKER_20]: So clearly we couldn't just pay that without financials or anything as related in the contractual language.

1789
02:48:43,884 --> 02:48:44,925
[SPEAKER_20]: That's all this came down to.

1790
02:48:45,846 --> 02:48:53,131
[SPEAKER_20]: So I sent an email to the mayor explaining the historical practices how we did to achieve Gilberti and how it worked pretty flawless and everything was fine.

1791
02:48:54,573 --> 02:48:56,114
[SPEAKER_20]: I requested a meeting with the mayor.

1792
02:48:56,854 --> 02:48:58,836
[SPEAKER_20]: So on April 29th I met with the mayor.

1793
02:48:59,825 --> 02:49:15,777
[SPEAKER_20]: And Chief Evans, again, went over it, told the mayor how we interpreted the law or the contract, told her what the process was when we discussed this, I think, Councilor Scarpelli, you mentioned Mayor Burke.

1794
02:49:16,677 --> 02:49:19,379
[SPEAKER_20]: And that was with the then solicitor, Mark Rumley.

1795
02:49:19,919 --> 02:49:26,623
[SPEAKER_20]: Mark Rumley was very good at making sure that the language had a direct nexus to Armstrong Ambulance as well as the city.

1796
02:49:26,643 --> 02:49:29,184
[SPEAKER_20]: And that was the EMD center.

1797
02:49:29,665 --> 02:49:32,546
[SPEAKER_20]: It had to be very specific from an OIG kickback statute.

1798
02:49:32,666 --> 02:49:35,648
[SPEAKER_20]: And Attorney Rumley wrote it really, really well for us.

1799
02:49:36,649 --> 02:49:42,612
[SPEAKER_20]: He also made it that if you read the contract, it says previous year, not years.

1800
02:49:42,712 --> 02:49:44,093
[SPEAKER_20]: And I did talk to Mark Rumley

1801
02:49:45,011 --> 02:49:49,952
[SPEAKER_20]: back in May and went over the language with him to ask if I was interpreting this wrong.

1802
02:49:50,352 --> 02:49:51,513
[SPEAKER_20]: And he said, absolutely not.

1803
02:49:51,633 --> 02:49:53,853
[SPEAKER_20]: We were absolutely correct in our interpretation of it.

1804
02:49:54,553 --> 02:49:59,595
[SPEAKER_20]: So that was when I spoke with Mark Rumley back in May.

1805
02:50:00,875 --> 02:50:06,416
[SPEAKER_20]: At that meeting, I left the mayor the check for $150,000 because it was March.

1806
02:50:06,956 --> 02:50:11,057
[SPEAKER_20]: I checked with our attorneys and we were gonna say the check was $75,000 for this year.

1807
02:50:13,944 --> 02:50:18,650
[SPEAKER_20]: And $75,000 for the immediate past year, provided we get the financials.

1808
02:50:20,392 --> 02:50:21,373
[SPEAKER_20]: Still haven't gotten the financials.

1809
02:50:21,973 --> 02:50:26,899
[SPEAKER_20]: We've gotten some financials to prove that they spent, I have it here, I have hundreds of emails.

1810
02:50:28,221 --> 02:50:34,448
[SPEAKER_20]: We have some financials that prove they spent, actually I do have it right here, that they spent.

1811
02:50:36,897 --> 02:50:38,118
[SPEAKER_20]: $58,000 so far.

1812
02:50:39,218 --> 02:50:44,141
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, so again, this is all backed up with hundreds of email with K. P. Law, Mark Reich.

1813
02:50:46,182 --> 02:50:49,703
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, so that meeting goes by.

1814
02:50:49,723 --> 02:50:54,686
[SPEAKER_20]: The mayor was not happy with the discussion when I asked her to check with Mark Romley.

1815
02:50:55,646 --> 02:50:57,227
[SPEAKER_20]: I could tell the tone changed a little bit.

1816
02:50:57,907 --> 02:50:59,248
[SPEAKER_20]: Eso from there.

1817
02:51:00,222 --> 02:51:09,911
[SPEAKER_20]: A couple days later, I get a phone call from a friend at ProAmbulance that says, hey, someone from City of Medford reached out, wanted to know if we bid on a contract.

1818
02:51:10,592 --> 02:51:13,935
[SPEAKER_20]: It was that phone call I knew we were losing this contract no matter what.

1819
02:51:16,658 --> 02:51:17,078
[SPEAKER_05]: When was that?

1820
02:51:17,318 --> 02:51:23,881
[SPEAKER_20]: ProAmbulance got a phone call from someone in the city of Medford, left a voicemail saying, hey, this is the city of Medford.

1821
02:51:24,501 --> 02:51:27,862
[SPEAKER_20]: Would ProAmbulance be interested in an RFP with the city of Medford?

1822
02:51:27,882 --> 02:51:28,602
[SPEAKER_05]: This is April?

1823
02:51:28,982 --> 02:51:29,202
[SPEAKER_05]: May?

1824
02:51:29,743 --> 02:51:30,043
[SPEAKER_20]: May.

1825
02:51:30,443 --> 02:51:34,584
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, first week of May.

1826
02:51:34,604 --> 02:51:35,124
[SPEAKER_20]: So, let's see.

1827
02:51:37,645 --> 02:51:40,786
[SPEAKER_20]: On May 7th, we received the email from K.P.

1828
02:51:40,966 --> 02:51:42,827
[SPEAKER_20]: Lahr, Special Counsel Mark Reich.

1829
02:51:43,497 --> 02:51:59,885
[SPEAKER_20]: implying if Armstrong did not pay the balance of monies requested, the contract could very well be terminated under 30B law, that Armstrong needs to think about that, Armstrong needs to think about that as related to the payment of $450,000.

1830
02:52:00,405 --> 02:52:11,371
[SPEAKER_20]: So again, I asked the mayor in that April meeting, respectfully, I know you're an attorney mayor, but I really think we need someone who understands

1831
02:52:11,998 --> 02:52:16,661
[SPEAKER_20]: Medicare law, so please could we have our attorneys sit with our attorneys?

1832
02:52:17,142 --> 02:52:22,806
[SPEAKER_20]: And if all the attorneys say, I'm sure I can write this check, no worries, no harm, no problem, we write that check.

1833
02:52:23,706 --> 02:52:25,107
[SPEAKER_20]: But there's always the concern.

1834
02:52:25,668 --> 02:52:34,454
[SPEAKER_20]: So we got the email to join a team's meeting with special counsel Mark Reich from KP Law.

1835
02:52:36,366 --> 02:52:38,187
[SPEAKER_20]: That was on May 7th.

1836
02:52:38,328 --> 02:52:38,708
[SPEAKER_20]: No, I'm sorry.

1837
02:52:38,968 --> 02:52:45,193
[SPEAKER_20]: May 7th was Mark sending the demand letter of make the payment or we're going to get the contract up on the 30B.

1838
02:52:45,973 --> 02:52:49,075
[SPEAKER_20]: So then we got a meeting on the books for May 20th.

1839
02:52:49,916 --> 02:52:58,823
[SPEAKER_20]: And at that meeting, it was Attorney Mark Reich, myself, one of our attorneys, Massachusetts law, David McCool.

1840
02:52:59,542 --> 02:53:07,986
[SPEAKER_20]: Attorney Scott Moore, who's what we would say is the Medicare compliance official attorney on the phone call, who's here tonight.

1841
02:53:08,086 --> 02:53:10,687
[SPEAKER_20]: If we want to ask him questions, he was kind enough to come.

1842
02:53:12,187 --> 02:53:24,312
[SPEAKER_20]: So the whole conversation with Mark Reich was really geared around the contractual language that's here on the 22 contract with the concerns of Medicare kickback statutes.

1843
02:53:25,573 --> 02:53:27,434
[SPEAKER_20]: Attorney Mark Reich,

1844
02:53:29,836 --> 02:53:32,998
[SPEAKER_20]: was very understanding, agreed with our interpretation.

1845
02:53:33,658 --> 02:53:39,843
[SPEAKER_20]: Totally, at one point he said, I'm very scared at the language of what we're reading.

1846
02:53:40,343 --> 02:53:50,270
[SPEAKER_20]: And he basically said under KP law, I do a lot of municipal contracts related to ambulance and I've never done one with money in the contract.

1847
02:53:50,850 --> 02:53:52,291
[SPEAKER_20]: So he understood our concerns.

1848
02:53:53,352 --> 02:53:57,375
[SPEAKER_20]: Attorney McCool at one point in the conversation asked,

1849
02:53:58,598 --> 02:54:02,761
[SPEAKER_20]: Attorney Reich, would you indemnify Armstrong Ambulance from any Medicare law?

1850
02:54:03,422 --> 02:54:06,144
[SPEAKER_20]: And he laughed and said, no, we would never.

1851
02:54:07,805 --> 02:54:17,273
[SPEAKER_20]: Attorney Reich mentioned he agreed with our concerns, but also mentioned my boss is demanding and I really need to work on settling the money.

1852
02:54:22,116 --> 02:54:24,258
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's see, now we're gonna go forward to late May.

1853
02:54:25,019 --> 02:54:26,640
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's where we left that conversation.

1854
02:54:27,383 --> 02:54:28,704
[SPEAKER_20]: And again, that was May 20th.

1855
02:54:30,545 --> 02:54:35,408
[SPEAKER_20]: Then there was a, funny, there was a legislative breakfast that I didn't attend on May 21st.

1856
02:54:37,369 --> 02:54:38,630
[SPEAKER_20]: I know the mayor went there.

1857
02:54:39,531 --> 02:54:40,591
[SPEAKER_20]: Dennis Cataldo was there.

1858
02:54:40,912 --> 02:54:42,313
[SPEAKER_20]: Got a phone call from Dennis after.

1859
02:54:42,793 --> 02:54:44,154
[SPEAKER_20]: Dennis said, hey, the mayor reached out.

1860
02:54:44,714 --> 02:54:45,855
[SPEAKER_20]: This was probably a couple days later.

1861
02:54:46,395 --> 02:54:47,496
[SPEAKER_20]: And Dennis was very open.

1862
02:54:47,756 --> 02:54:48,577
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm going to go meet with her.

1863
02:54:49,097 --> 02:54:56,121
[SPEAKER_20]: And again, so I really knew by calling Pro and by calling Cataldo that our Armstrong didn't have a chance any longer.

1864
02:54:57,702 --> 02:54:59,343
[SPEAKER_20]: But again, I am not here.

1865
02:54:59,844 --> 02:55:01,665
[SPEAKER_20]: I am friends with Dennis Cataldo.

1866
02:55:02,186 --> 02:55:04,708
[SPEAKER_20]: They're EMTs and paramedics are our brothers and sisters.

1867
02:55:04,748 --> 02:55:05,668
[SPEAKER_20]: This isn't about that.

1868
02:55:06,209 --> 02:55:11,593
[SPEAKER_20]: This is about the way the language in the contract determined our termination.

1869
02:55:13,314 --> 02:55:15,816
[SPEAKER_20]: So again, now we're into June.

1870
02:55:17,077 --> 02:55:20,280
[SPEAKER_20]: Email from KP Law thanking Armstrong for a very productive meeting.

1871
02:55:21,041 --> 02:55:26,405
[SPEAKER_20]: June 4th, KP Law indicated eagerness to resolve this matter before the end of the fiscal year from the mayor.

1872
02:55:27,164 --> 02:55:31,206
[SPEAKER_20]: From KP Law, the mayor is eager to resolve this before the end of the fiscal year.

1873
02:55:33,546 --> 02:55:40,689
[SPEAKER_20]: Scott Moore and Attorney Warfel submitted some new proposed language that was to protect both Armstrong and the city.

1874
02:55:42,370 --> 02:55:46,771
[SPEAKER_20]: So again, back and forth, back and forth, back and forth with KP Law.

1875
02:55:47,452 --> 02:55:51,153
[SPEAKER_20]: KP Law on August 11th, so there was a big hiatus from June to August.

1876
02:55:52,365 --> 02:56:20,569
[SPEAKER_20]: But we we left that hundred and fifty thousand dollar check with With the mayor so on August 11 KP law revised the city would not provide financials for the hundred and fifty thousand because we still haven't gotten any Would not provide financials until December for the hundred and fifty thousand paid thousand dollar payment made on April 21st So that's on August 11 Then there was a circulation

1877
02:56:22,552 --> 02:56:29,916
[SPEAKER_20]: We heard that the fire chief was shown a contract that had the wrong amount of vehicles.

1878
02:56:30,436 --> 02:56:32,417
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's on Attorney McCool.

1879
02:56:32,877 --> 02:56:35,838
[SPEAKER_20]: He was only focused on bullet 10, which is the money.

1880
02:56:36,199 --> 02:56:39,380
[SPEAKER_20]: How do we protect both the city and Armstrong on bullet 10?

1881
02:56:39,860 --> 02:56:43,842
[SPEAKER_20]: So I reached out to the chief and said, that's incorrect.

1882
02:56:44,082 --> 02:56:45,563
[SPEAKER_20]: That is a wrong draft.

1883
02:56:46,003 --> 02:56:47,164
[SPEAKER_20]: All we're working on is section 10.

1884
02:56:50,632 --> 02:56:57,093
[SPEAKER_20]: I actually emailed the Chief Evans on August 12th saying, you know, Chief, I'm stuck in the middle of the attorneys.

1885
02:56:57,774 --> 02:57:01,654
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm asking could you please help navigate this meeting to your appoint Councilor.

1886
02:57:01,754 --> 02:57:03,015
[SPEAKER_20]: Like try to get the people at the table.

1887
02:57:03,595 --> 02:57:04,915
[SPEAKER_20]: But no response in the email.

1888
02:57:08,996 --> 02:57:11,897
[SPEAKER_20]: October 9th, we got an issue for another $75,000 check.

1889
02:57:14,350 --> 02:57:21,056
[SPEAKER_20]: And again, I responded back, and it was, again, from the financial office.

1890
02:57:23,279 --> 02:57:31,086
[SPEAKER_20]: I responded back with, that would go out into December's payments, because it was for the end of the year contract.

1891
02:57:31,426 --> 02:57:34,789
[SPEAKER_20]: Which, again, we probably shouldn't have paid, cuz we paid the 150.

1892
02:57:34,869 --> 02:57:38,553
[SPEAKER_20]: But in good will, I'm trying to make this happen, provided we get the financials.

1893
02:57:40,398 --> 02:57:56,524
[SPEAKER_20]: On October 21st, we met with, this is a team's meeting, on October 21st, team's meeting with the new city solicitor, Kevin Foley, Mark Reich from KP Law, police chief, fire chief, myself, Sean Mangan, and our attorney, David McCool.

1894
02:57:58,145 --> 02:58:00,286
[SPEAKER_20]: We brought Kevin Foley up to speed.

1895
02:58:00,626 --> 02:58:01,406
[SPEAKER_20]: He was wonderful.

1896
02:58:02,086 --> 02:58:08,769
[SPEAKER_20]: Again, worked in different municipalities, totally agreed that the money should not be in anything of a contractual language.

1897
02:58:09,802 --> 02:58:15,166
[SPEAKER_20]: His mission, he said, was to get the money taken out of that contract and work with the mayor on that.

1898
02:58:15,746 --> 02:58:20,349
[SPEAKER_20]: We did a round robin, asked if everybody was okay with Armstrong keeping the contract.

1899
02:58:20,869 --> 02:58:23,091
[SPEAKER_20]: Both police and fire chief said yes.

1900
02:58:23,711 --> 02:58:27,674
[SPEAKER_20]: No concerns of response times or quality or anything was brought up at that meeting.

1901
02:58:28,254 --> 02:58:39,362
[SPEAKER_20]: Kevin Foley then said, great, I'm gonna go to the mayor and the city council because if everyone's in agreeing, I'm gonna go to the council and ask for a five year contract, not even a three year,

1902
02:58:40,291 --> 02:58:43,212
[SPEAKER_20]: So we can not have to do this every three years.

1903
02:58:44,132 --> 02:58:47,133
[SPEAKER_20]: So Sean and I left the meeting and I never felt better.

1904
02:58:47,293 --> 02:58:49,273
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean I've been sick since this happened in April.

1905
02:58:50,193 --> 02:58:53,954
[SPEAKER_20]: After that meeting with the city solicitor saying he agrees he's going to work on it.

1906
02:58:54,294 --> 02:58:59,555
[SPEAKER_20]: He's going to move the lane right the contract so it's good for everybody.

1907
02:59:00,836 --> 02:59:02,636
[SPEAKER_20]: Again I left that meeting I never felt so good.

1908
02:59:04,416 --> 02:59:05,057
[SPEAKER_20]: Time went on.

1909
02:59:06,437 --> 02:59:07,117
[SPEAKER_20]: No response.

1910
02:59:08,127 --> 02:59:11,849
[SPEAKER_20]: Then we heard that the city solicitor got terminated, so that left us out.

1911
02:59:14,710 --> 02:59:17,912
[SPEAKER_20]: Then on November 6th, KP Lahr sent us a contract.

1912
02:59:18,893 --> 02:59:23,815
[SPEAKER_20]: I immediately picked up the phone and I called Attorney Reich from KP Lahr.

1913
02:59:23,835 --> 02:59:27,057
[SPEAKER_20]: I said, I quickly read it, I agree with all the terms.

1914
02:59:27,637 --> 02:59:32,499
[SPEAKER_20]: There's a couple things in there we gotta put some guardrails on, but as a company, we agree with all the terms.

1915
02:59:34,380 --> 02:59:37,242
[SPEAKER_20]: He said, great, I'll let the mayor know, that should make her happy.

1916
02:59:38,825 --> 02:59:40,206
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's see, November 17th.

1917
02:59:41,847 --> 02:59:44,568
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh no, that was on November 17th, sorry.

1918
02:59:45,049 --> 02:59:55,155
[SPEAKER_20]: So on November 19th, we met with the police chief, the fire chief, Sean Mang and myself to just discuss the operational language again.

1919
02:59:56,624 --> 03:00:03,748
[SPEAKER_20]: Some of the items we talked about was a supervisor on the truck, or an offline supervisor, how many ALS units, how many BLS units.

1920
03:00:04,969 --> 03:00:13,693
[SPEAKER_20]: We talked about two, the ALS units, the BLS, keeping a BLS in the city because it's good for the BLS providers to have that hands-on skill.

1921
03:00:14,053 --> 03:00:17,595
[SPEAKER_20]: When we talk about behavioral health, a lot of the calls are not actually ALS level.

1922
03:00:18,076 --> 03:00:20,337
[SPEAKER_20]: That's what the BLS truck would work with, and again,

1923
03:00:21,017 --> 03:00:22,298
[SPEAKER_20]: We've been doing this for 30 years.

1924
03:00:22,338 --> 03:00:25,580
[SPEAKER_20]: We have all the data to prove we're going to put the best system in place.

1925
03:00:25,600 --> 03:00:30,043
[SPEAKER_20]: The non-transport supervisor was a point I'm

1926
03:00:30,830 --> 03:00:38,512
[SPEAKER_20]: As a long time ago paramedic, I can tell you I was stuck in a non-transport vehicle with an unconscious baby and we couldn't transport.

1927
03:00:38,892 --> 03:00:43,333
[SPEAKER_20]: I've always been against single paramedics in a fly car.

1928
03:00:43,893 --> 03:00:46,673
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a gut feeling, it happens once and you never want it to happen.

1929
03:00:47,213 --> 03:00:51,854
[SPEAKER_20]: So we were against that, but we wanted the supervisor to be on an ambulance and they agreed.

1930
03:00:52,435 --> 03:00:54,935
[SPEAKER_20]: No one pushed back and said, no, this is what we want.

1931
03:00:55,695 --> 03:00:59,056
[SPEAKER_20]: So we left that meeting again saying, okay, we're in good place, good shape.

1932
03:01:02,944 --> 03:01:05,645
[SPEAKER_20]: We talked about the EMT training.

1933
03:01:06,165 --> 03:01:07,545
[SPEAKER_20]: We don't personally do it in-house.

1934
03:01:07,645 --> 03:01:08,886
[SPEAKER_20]: We rather do it outside.

1935
03:01:09,946 --> 03:01:12,767
[SPEAKER_20]: And we talked to the chief about that.

1936
03:01:13,988 --> 03:01:15,148
[SPEAKER_20]: We weren't a no on that.

1937
03:01:15,308 --> 03:01:17,769
[SPEAKER_20]: There's just federal guidelines on how to do that.

1938
03:01:18,249 --> 03:01:20,290
[SPEAKER_20]: As long as the attorneys agreed, we're all in.

1939
03:01:21,135 --> 03:01:23,676
[SPEAKER_20]: The more EMTs on the fire trucks, the better for us.

1940
03:01:23,716 --> 03:01:25,617
[SPEAKER_20]: It makes everybody's job a lot easier.

1941
03:01:26,438 --> 03:01:28,158
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's a great partnership.

1942
03:01:28,198 --> 03:01:33,080
[SPEAKER_20]: So again, from a legal perspective, we were all in on that.

1943
03:01:36,562 --> 03:01:39,163
[SPEAKER_20]: The behavioral health unit, long story.

1944
03:01:39,203 --> 03:01:40,964
[SPEAKER_20]: This is a bright, shiny thing that just came up.

1945
03:01:41,024 --> 03:01:49,388
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not sure, but back in 2022, 23, December, January, I was appointed to the mayor's behavioral health council.

1946
03:01:50,180 --> 03:02:02,686
[SPEAKER_20]: During those meetings that I attended I met with Penny and said hey we should think about this so much so that on June of that twenty twenty three year I met with Elliott Health.

1947
03:02:04,507 --> 03:02:06,588
[SPEAKER_20]: Gail Pory works at Elliott Health.

1948
03:02:08,250 --> 03:02:15,833
[SPEAKER_20]: picked their brain on how to do it, brought the information back to Penny back in 2023, June, and we never got any movement on that.

1949
03:02:16,553 --> 03:02:20,854
[SPEAKER_20]: So we were trying to be the first to do this, just couldn't get too much movement on it.

1950
03:02:23,755 --> 03:02:32,438
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's see, November, November 24th, I hand-delivered the $75,000 check to the City of Medford, City Hall.

1951
03:02:33,898 --> 03:02:35,138
[SPEAKER_20]: That was, payment was made.

1952
03:02:35,839 --> 03:02:36,779
[SPEAKER_20]: No follow-up email.

1953
03:02:37,759 --> 03:02:39,540
[SPEAKER_20]: No financials given.

1954
03:02:40,180 --> 03:02:44,802
[SPEAKER_20]: The first 150 actually got a follow up email from the mayor saying thank you very much.

1955
03:02:45,342 --> 03:02:50,525
[SPEAKER_20]: So this $75,000 on November 4th, we never got a follow up email that said thank you.

1956
03:02:52,145 --> 03:02:55,527
[SPEAKER_20]: So now we go into December.

1957
03:02:57,308 --> 03:03:07,372
[SPEAKER_20]: On December 11th, and the mayor specifically talks about how we had a conversation with the police chief on December 11th, that was Sean and I calling him asking, hey chief,

1958
03:03:08,385 --> 03:03:11,747
[SPEAKER_20]: we understand the contracts out there in the ether.

1959
03:03:12,147 --> 03:03:13,048
[SPEAKER_20]: Do you know where it is?

1960
03:03:13,408 --> 03:03:14,369
[SPEAKER_20]: What's going on with it?

1961
03:03:14,489 --> 03:03:15,189
[SPEAKER_20]: Can we sign it?

1962
03:03:16,350 --> 03:03:21,113
[SPEAKER_20]: And he said, I'm not exactly sure, but I'm very concerned that they already have a signed contract.

1963
03:03:21,853 --> 03:03:23,434
[SPEAKER_20]: So that was on December 11th.

1964
03:03:24,295 --> 03:03:30,598
[SPEAKER_20]: So on December 12th, I emailed the mayor asking, you know, where are we at with the email?

1965
03:03:31,099 --> 03:03:37,903
[SPEAKER_20]: On December 13th, I get the email back from the mayor with the header of attorney-client privilege.

1966
03:03:39,233 --> 03:03:49,559
[SPEAKER_20]: And the, you know, the mayor's responded, the city is going in a different direction and stated, with that being said, we do not want to go public on the reasoning of why we are going in another direction.

1967
03:03:50,439 --> 03:03:56,503
[SPEAKER_20]: We want to try and keep a good relationship with you all, as you never know what will happen in the future.

1968
03:04:00,546 --> 03:04:02,387
[SPEAKER_20]: It's all documented in my emails.

1969
03:04:03,128 --> 03:04:08,111
[SPEAKER_20]: The mayor's email on, you know, we're going in a different direction, but we are going in a different direction.

1970
03:04:08,631 --> 03:04:13,995
[SPEAKER_20]: With that being said, we do not want to go public on the reasoning of why we are going in another direction.

1971
03:04:14,455 --> 03:04:19,178
[SPEAKER_20]: We want to try to keep a good relationship with you all as you never know what will happen in the future.

1972
03:04:21,040 --> 03:04:28,685
[SPEAKER_20]: So on December 15th, I sent another email to the mayor, the police and the fire chief asking them to

1973
03:04:30,253 --> 03:04:32,614
[SPEAKER_20]: Basically, please don't do this, let me tell you why.

1974
03:04:32,634 --> 03:04:42,378
[SPEAKER_20]: Armstrong is just so situated around Medford, and again, this is not about any other ambulance company.

1975
03:04:42,998 --> 03:04:53,902
[SPEAKER_20]: We are just geographically perfectly set to be around Armstrong, so much so, when I met with the mayor about the first meeting with the mayor and I handed the $150,000 check back in,

1976
03:04:57,263 --> 03:05:12,527
[SPEAKER_20]: Sorry back in whatever it is March or April April the night before the day before we had 50 responses in Medford 50 responses and we handled all 50 of those with just Armstrong ambulance no mutual aid.

1977
03:05:13,398 --> 03:05:21,262
[SPEAKER_20]: So, and I brought that out in the meeting, said, hey mayor, I know we're gonna have a difficult discussion, but I wanna let you know, I'm trying to keep everybody happy.

1978
03:05:22,022 --> 03:05:26,344
[SPEAKER_20]: Just yesterday, this happened, and we handled all of these calls without mutual aid.

1979
03:05:26,924 --> 03:05:28,645
[SPEAKER_20]: No other provider could do that, no way.

1980
03:05:29,245 --> 03:05:32,627
[SPEAKER_20]: So, again, my whole thing is the patient.

1981
03:05:35,508 --> 03:05:42,972
[SPEAKER_20]: December 17th, I sent another email to the mayor, police chief, fire chief, oh, still no response from any of the emails.

1982
03:05:44,512 --> 03:05:48,475
[SPEAKER_20]: Asking them again, please, we're a better ambulance company, this is why.

1983
03:05:48,875 --> 03:05:49,995
[SPEAKER_20]: Please, please, please.

1984
03:05:50,636 --> 03:05:51,176
[SPEAKER_20]: No response.

1985
03:05:51,956 --> 03:05:56,419
[SPEAKER_20]: So, I have hundreds of emails, can back all of this up.

1986
03:05:57,359 --> 03:06:01,361
[SPEAKER_20]: I just, again, I can answer a million questions.

1987
03:06:01,722 --> 03:06:06,764
[SPEAKER_20]: I couldn't even write any more notes down when I heard all the questions, but a couple things that came to me.

1988
03:06:08,205 --> 03:06:13,348
[SPEAKER_20]: When the chief of staff mentioned Cataldo rose to the top, what was the criteria?

1989
03:06:14,406 --> 03:06:17,127
[SPEAKER_20]: Like, what were the criteria?

1990
03:06:17,587 --> 03:06:19,008
[SPEAKER_20]: How could we not rise to the top?

1991
03:06:19,668 --> 03:06:23,269
[SPEAKER_20]: There was no criteria for us to look at to rise to the top.

1992
03:06:25,590 --> 03:06:27,070
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, let's see.

1993
03:06:27,130 --> 03:06:30,111
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm just looking at the different... Mutual aid.

1994
03:06:30,551 --> 03:06:31,332
[SPEAKER_20]: That was a great one.

1995
03:06:31,892 --> 03:06:33,072
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, it is a law.

1996
03:06:33,232 --> 03:06:34,193
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a public health law.

1997
03:06:34,293 --> 03:06:37,914
[SPEAKER_20]: We have to respond and take the law out of it.

1998
03:06:38,378 --> 03:06:39,798
[SPEAKER_20]: It's ethically the right thing to do.

1999
03:06:40,358 --> 03:06:51,480
[SPEAKER_20]: If there's a paramedic unit that is in Medford, but the cardiac arrest is across the line in Arlington, we're gonna send the closest paramedic unit to save a life, because it's the right thing to do by the patient.

2000
03:06:52,160 --> 03:06:53,381
[SPEAKER_20]: We're not gonna get caught up in that.

2001
03:06:53,861 --> 03:07:06,563
[SPEAKER_20]: And to somebody who was asking, when we move trucks, just like that day when I told the mayor we had 40-something responses and we covered them all, sure, a truck might be going to save a life in Arlington, but we're backing it up.

2002
03:07:07,504 --> 03:07:07,945
[SPEAKER_20]: We don't.

2003
03:07:08,365 --> 03:07:13,470
[SPEAKER_20]: Ninety nine plus percent of the calls in the city are covered by Medford flat.

2004
03:07:14,231 --> 03:07:14,631
[SPEAKER_20]: No doubt.

2005
03:07:14,991 --> 03:07:18,335
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyone who wants to debate that data please bring the data.

2006
03:07:19,857 --> 03:07:24,421
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, we give mutual aid to adjoining cities and towns.

2007
03:07:24,881 --> 03:07:25,782
[SPEAKER_20]: We don't request it.

2008
03:07:26,483 --> 03:07:31,887
[SPEAKER_20]: We are in the perfect spot for Arlington, I mean, from Medford.

2009
03:07:32,407 --> 03:07:36,571
[SPEAKER_20]: When we look at Arlington, we have a base there that holds about 10 trucks.

2010
03:07:37,151 --> 03:07:38,552
[SPEAKER_20]: Woburn holds about 20 trucks.

2011
03:07:39,233 --> 03:07:41,935
[SPEAKER_20]: And then the other municipalities that we cover around it.

2012
03:07:41,975 --> 03:07:45,798
[SPEAKER_20]: So we have 60 trucks within about five miles of Medford.

2013
03:07:46,419 --> 03:07:47,800
[SPEAKER_20]: So when we talk about,

2014
03:07:48,420 --> 03:07:49,741
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, we're giving trucks to Arlington.

2015
03:07:50,221 --> 03:07:55,644
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, Arlington's given us a lot of trucks in Medford to make sure that the patient has an immediate response.

2016
03:07:56,285 --> 03:07:58,686
[SPEAKER_20]: So I will challenge anybody's data on that.

2017
03:07:59,207 --> 03:08:06,871
[SPEAKER_20]: And to your point, Councilman, yes, all of our data is updated into the state matrix, Massachusetts Ambulance Trip.

2018
03:08:07,892 --> 03:08:09,913
[SPEAKER_20]: So every ambulance company has to put our data up.

2019
03:08:10,273 --> 03:08:11,914
[SPEAKER_20]: All of our response times are tracked.

2020
03:08:14,312 --> 03:08:24,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Rich, just to clarify, what you're saying is 99% of EMS in Medford is covered by Armstrong trucks, and you're not asking other companies to come into Medford to cover that.

2021
03:08:25,180 --> 03:08:25,520
[SPEAKER_20]: That's great.

2022
03:08:26,260 --> 03:08:41,571
[SPEAKER_05]: But those trucks may be coming from your Arlington hub or maybe Woburn, but mostly, you know, but you're not asking Cataldo or some of the other companies to come into Medford, and you're actually sending some of your trucks out to communities that aren't Armstrong communities to provide mutually.

2023
03:08:41,591 --> 03:08:41,991
[SPEAKER_20]: That's correct.

2024
03:08:42,251 --> 03:08:42,752
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you.

2025
03:08:45,434 --> 03:08:48,577
[SPEAKER_20]: So mutual aid, I'm sorry, mutual response times.

2026
03:08:49,077 --> 03:08:57,664
[SPEAKER_20]: And again, yeah, all of our response times, it is scrubbed between GPS, AVL, cameras, recordings.

2027
03:08:57,884 --> 03:08:59,325
[SPEAKER_20]: We scrub it, scrub it, scrub it.

2028
03:09:00,206 --> 03:09:01,367
[SPEAKER_20]: Can some things get by us?

2029
03:09:01,667 --> 03:09:01,907
[SPEAKER_20]: Sure.

2030
03:09:02,528 --> 03:09:04,710
[SPEAKER_20]: But it's a small time.

2031
03:09:05,270 --> 03:09:06,311
[SPEAKER_20]: And in the contract,

2032
03:09:07,809 --> 03:09:13,616
[SPEAKER_20]: There's also a clause in the contract that if our response times exceed a certain number, we got to pay a penalty to the city.

2033
03:09:14,437 --> 03:09:15,799
[SPEAKER_20]: We never paid a penalty to the city.

2034
03:09:16,700 --> 03:09:20,104
[SPEAKER_20]: Our response time on average is about four and a half minutes.

2035
03:09:26,069 --> 03:09:42,862
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I want to make sure it's clear because I think that what we heard was a dialogue of misinformation that your numbers are skewed, that the call goes to you so your clock doesn't start until two minutes after the call goes to our 911 center.

2036
03:09:43,262 --> 03:09:44,603
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I'm a little confused about.

2037
03:09:45,564 --> 03:09:46,425
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Raymond.

2038
03:09:47,186 --> 03:09:58,977
[SPEAKER_09]: If it's not truly four and a half minutes, as our 9-1-1 supervisor states, that there's a gap time there, so it really doesn't equate, because that's what they were saying, I need to know that.

2039
03:09:59,598 --> 03:10:00,419
[SPEAKER_09]: That's going to stay a lot.

2040
03:10:01,179 --> 03:10:11,465
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately, even if it's too late for you, I will tell you, I'm going to be a blood, I'm going to be a bloodhound on the next ambulance service company to make sure their response times are where we deserve here in Medford.

2041
03:10:11,485 --> 03:10:12,625
[SPEAKER_09]: So I want you to be aware.

2042
03:10:12,685 --> 03:10:16,768
[SPEAKER_09]: So please answer that question because I need to know this is a key piece of this whole process.

2043
03:10:17,548 --> 03:10:19,009
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for bringing me back to EMD.

2044
03:10:19,069 --> 03:10:22,210
[SPEAKER_20]: So EMD, another, back in 2011, the state created, um,

2045
03:10:26,702 --> 03:10:39,070
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sorry, the state mandated that call centers have to have certified personnel, and they have to have everything recorded, a big infrastructure, and the personnel to do QA.

2046
03:10:39,811 --> 03:10:46,796
[SPEAKER_20]: Back then, Mayor McGlynn, Chief Giliberti, Chief Sacco were like, whoa, we can't afford this, we don't wanna do this.

2047
03:10:47,396 --> 03:10:51,439
[SPEAKER_20]: So working with them, and back then Bill Armstrong,

2048
03:10:52,339 --> 03:10:53,239
[SPEAKER_20]: That was for us.

2049
03:10:53,499 --> 03:10:54,680
[SPEAKER_20]: We took it on ourselves.

2050
03:10:54,780 --> 03:10:56,720
[SPEAKER_20]: We bid the cost of that infrastructure.

2051
03:10:57,160 --> 03:10:58,381
[SPEAKER_20]: We purchased the radios.

2052
03:10:58,861 --> 03:11:00,181
[SPEAKER_20]: We put the personnel together.

2053
03:11:01,061 --> 03:11:02,762
[SPEAKER_20]: Medford was our first EMD center.

2054
03:11:03,222 --> 03:11:08,583
[SPEAKER_20]: And again, we did it for free, and we can talk about the money in a minute because that's another herring.

2055
03:11:08,863 --> 03:11:17,566
[SPEAKER_20]: We did it for free for years and years and years because, again, that was a responsibility that we needed EMD.

2056
03:11:17,986 --> 03:11:18,926
[SPEAKER_20]: The city couldn't do it.

2057
03:11:19,486 --> 03:11:21,387
[SPEAKER_20]: Armstrong stood up and said, we'll do it for you.

2058
03:11:22,307 --> 03:11:25,430
[SPEAKER_20]: And then it grew and grew and grew, and now we do like 14 communities.

2059
03:11:26,191 --> 03:11:29,513
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's called, we're a secondary PSAP.

2060
03:11:29,593 --> 03:11:30,494
[SPEAKER_20]: Medford gets the call.

2061
03:11:31,135 --> 03:11:33,937
[SPEAKER_20]: Medford then says, a one-call transfer, it's right on their screen.

2062
03:11:35,479 --> 03:11:38,800
[SPEAKER_20]: Medford Fire Alarm, I'm going to transfer you to EMD.

2063
03:11:39,341 --> 03:11:42,022
[SPEAKER_20]: They click it, Armstrong Ambulance, call it where you're calling from.

2064
03:11:42,642 --> 03:11:43,923
[SPEAKER_20]: Two people are listening to that.

2065
03:11:44,483 --> 03:11:51,266
[SPEAKER_20]: So the EMD person is given medical direction, the other one is our dispatcher, immediately send in an ambulance.

2066
03:11:52,266 --> 03:11:52,647
[SPEAKER_20]: Immediate.

2067
03:11:53,547 --> 03:11:53,947
[SPEAKER_20]: Immediate.

2068
03:11:54,968 --> 03:11:55,128
[SPEAKER_20]: No.

2069
03:11:55,868 --> 03:11:56,008
[SPEAKER_20]: No.

2070
03:11:56,848 --> 03:11:57,048
[SPEAKER_20]: So.

2071
03:11:58,869 --> 03:11:59,710
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli.

2072
03:12:00,250 --> 03:12:00,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

2073
03:12:03,387 --> 03:12:03,687
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

2074
03:12:03,767 --> 03:12:04,928
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's you.

2075
03:12:05,048 --> 03:12:08,489
[SPEAKER_20]: I invite anybody wants to come to Arlington and see our dispatch center.

2076
03:12:09,069 --> 03:12:09,489
[SPEAKER_20]: Please come.

2077
03:12:11,310 --> 03:12:14,491
[SPEAKER_20]: Everything again recorded phone lines AVL GPS.

2078
03:12:14,551 --> 03:12:17,052
[SPEAKER_20]: Everything is respond is recorded.

2079
03:12:17,132 --> 03:12:19,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Rich and George I have a question from Councilor Leming.

2080
03:12:20,653 --> 03:12:21,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Leming.

2081
03:12:22,189 --> 03:12:24,150
[SPEAKER_11]: No, this is a bit more of an open-ended one.

2082
03:12:24,791 --> 03:12:33,936
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, we've talked about the technical details of response times, reporting zones quite a bit throughout this meeting, I'm sure.

2083
03:12:35,317 --> 03:12:43,381
[SPEAKER_11]: It's complicated, and I'd probably need to have a much longer conversation to understand all the ins and outs.

2084
03:12:43,562 --> 03:12:48,384
[SPEAKER_11]: But just stepping back, a bit more of an open-ended question here.

2085
03:12:49,685 --> 03:13:05,550
[SPEAKER_11]: From your perspective, and I'm asking more for your opinion here, at what point do you think the things went south with the city beyond the point of repair?

2086
03:13:05,710 --> 03:13:12,812
[SPEAKER_11]: At what point do you think the decision was made to cut ties with Armstrong?

2087
03:13:13,922 --> 03:13:23,148
[SPEAKER_11]: When do you think that happened, just in your, this could be speculative, I just kind of want to know what your point of view is on this.

2088
03:13:23,208 --> 03:13:34,556
[SPEAKER_11]: Not necessarily when you learned that the decision was made, but at what point in the process do you think, okay, things are south and I don't think this is salvageable?

2089
03:13:38,278 --> 03:13:39,159
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sorry, April 29th.

2090
03:13:39,339 --> 03:13:56,670
[SPEAKER_20]: That's the meeting I had with the mayor when I talked about past practices, contractual language, how Mark Rumley wrote it to only go one time in the rear, one year in the rears, that it has to be a direct nexus to the EMD center to protect both parties.

2091
03:13:58,091 --> 03:14:06,617
[SPEAKER_20]: And then when I requested attorneys to agree to that, and then, like I said, a couple days later, a phone call was made to one of our competitors,

2092
03:14:07,218 --> 03:14:08,300
[SPEAKER_20]: I knew it was over right there.

2093
03:14:09,642 --> 03:14:14,853
[SPEAKER_11]: Could you just indulge me and just talk a little bit more about the details of what happened at that meeting?

2094
03:14:15,979 --> 03:14:26,381
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, so we, I, again, we talked about the, I sent her an email about the previous, um, not previous, but how the process has worked in the past.

2095
03:14:26,981 --> 03:14:36,783
[SPEAKER_20]: And again, when you look at the city was nice enough to send me a detailed financial report of how we've been paying through 2000, whatever, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, all the way up to 2020.

2096
03:14:37,024 --> 03:14:38,184
[SPEAKER_20]: And then without a problem.

2097
03:14:44,406 --> 03:14:47,048
[SPEAKER_20]: The financials were given, checks were cut.

2098
03:14:47,409 --> 03:14:49,471
[SPEAKER_20]: 2020, no one asked for anything again.

2099
03:14:51,053 --> 03:14:51,653
[SPEAKER_20]: So that was it.

2100
03:14:51,733 --> 03:14:53,615
[SPEAKER_20]: So what the change was in 2020, I don't know.

2101
03:14:56,565 --> 03:14:59,887
[SPEAKER_20]: Again, we would never know, because we weren't know the other 10 years.

2102
03:15:01,608 --> 03:15:04,630
[SPEAKER_20]: So what happened from 2020 forward?

2103
03:15:05,410 --> 03:15:07,451
[SPEAKER_20]: Someone didn't read the contract, someone didn't ask.

2104
03:15:07,792 --> 03:15:15,316
[SPEAKER_20]: I can't answer that question, but again, in the contract it also reads if we have a performance issue or anything, we also pay a penalty.

2105
03:15:16,296 --> 03:15:20,359
[SPEAKER_20]: Not that we've ever gone below the number, but there's penalties in there as well.

2106
03:15:21,539 --> 03:15:23,361
[SPEAKER_20]: But did that answer your question?

2107
03:15:23,401 --> 03:15:23,721
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sorry.

2108
03:15:24,401 --> 03:15:24,581
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

2109
03:15:24,781 --> 03:15:24,961
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

2110
03:15:25,142 --> 03:15:25,442
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

2111
03:15:25,702 --> 03:15:25,842
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

2112
03:15:28,854 --> 03:15:30,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Leming.

2113
03:15:30,515 --> 03:15:31,216
[SPEAKER_05]: Any further questions?

2114
03:15:32,457 --> 03:15:32,637
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

2115
03:15:32,757 --> 03:15:33,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli.

2116
03:15:34,238 --> 03:15:46,868
[SPEAKER_09]: Real quick, to bring it back a little bit, when you go through this process of the 911 and the EMD, when you get a call, everything is recorded, right?

2117
03:15:46,988 --> 03:15:48,069
[SPEAKER_09]: That's correct.

2118
03:15:49,811 --> 03:15:51,312
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you share that with the chief?

2119
03:15:52,177 --> 03:15:55,842
[SPEAKER_09]: If it's needed, if he's asking for like there's the daily trip reports.

2120
03:15:55,862 --> 03:15:58,326
[SPEAKER_20]: Yep, there's daily trip reports that can be sent.

2121
03:15:59,768 --> 03:16:02,432
[SPEAKER_20]: But they're complex and confusing, no doubt, but it does.

2122
03:16:03,033 --> 03:16:05,256
[SPEAKER_20]: And again, we can sit and show and read, but it's.

2123
03:16:06,295 --> 03:16:11,078
[SPEAKER_20]: if a truck is pulled from one to another to another because of moving the closest unit.

2124
03:16:11,118 --> 03:16:16,181
[SPEAKER_20]: But ideally, the data is there, response time, on scene time, transport time.

2125
03:16:16,441 --> 03:16:22,304
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, but if there's a concern, you don't require a FOIA from the city to ask for your recordings.

2126
03:16:22,584 --> 03:16:23,185
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I know.

2127
03:16:23,425 --> 03:16:24,005
[SPEAKER_20]: No, okay.

2128
03:16:24,085 --> 03:16:25,126
[SPEAKER_20]: Open book, have whatever you want.

2129
03:16:25,606 --> 03:16:30,169
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so that brings me to the other question that was brought forward was the lack of

2130
03:16:30,709 --> 03:16:31,470
[SPEAKER_09]: response time.

2131
03:16:31,490 --> 03:16:33,451
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that we're responding.

2132
03:16:33,471 --> 03:16:36,053
[SPEAKER_09]: I know the chief said he had to contact the mayor, correct?

2133
03:16:36,113 --> 03:16:42,378
[SPEAKER_09]: And the mayor had to reach out to you because you weren't giving, I believe Sean wasn't giving them the information correctly.

2134
03:16:42,679 --> 03:16:44,140
[SPEAKER_09]: They weren't getting their daily logs.

2135
03:16:44,680 --> 03:16:49,504
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know that when I talked to the former chiefs, they explained to me what they required.

2136
03:16:49,524 --> 03:16:51,786
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that Chief Gillibird is a little more intense.

2137
03:16:51,826 --> 03:16:55,589
[SPEAKER_09]: He's married to this baby and he was very clear in how he

2138
03:16:56,208 --> 03:17:04,632
[SPEAKER_09]: God he told me that there was many times that it went for six minutes and he read that on Monday afternoon at six o'clock that there was a run for six minutes.

2139
03:17:05,233 --> 03:17:15,257
[SPEAKER_09]: He would have you in the office the next morning and say tell me why this last this and he would say they would say simple that the report would say gate down at

2140
03:17:16,939 --> 03:17:23,107
[SPEAKER_09]: train crossing on West Medford and then you would then proceed and give them the route that you will correct.

2141
03:17:23,127 --> 03:17:25,109
[SPEAKER_09]: So are we not doing that anymore?

2142
03:17:25,129 --> 03:17:26,551
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that's what we're hearing.

2143
03:17:27,272 --> 03:17:28,694
[SPEAKER_20]: It doesn't seem to be that.

2144
03:17:29,655 --> 03:17:31,557
[SPEAKER_20]: Again, I don't want to, I would rather

2145
03:17:32,497 --> 03:17:34,339
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean Sean can come up and talk to that if you want.

2146
03:17:35,180 --> 03:17:37,523
[SPEAKER_20]: But it's never it's never no with us.

2147
03:17:38,705 --> 03:17:39,626
[SPEAKER_20]: We do share the data.

2148
03:17:40,007 --> 03:17:42,690
[SPEAKER_20]: No doubt if the request is there.

2149
03:17:42,750 --> 03:17:47,737
[SPEAKER_20]: But again if Chief G didn't hear from from Sean.

2150
03:17:48,277 --> 03:17:49,318
[SPEAKER_20]: I was in the office, right?

2151
03:17:49,418 --> 03:17:50,458
[SPEAKER_20]: It was always a dual fold.

2152
03:17:51,439 --> 03:17:57,542
[SPEAKER_20]: Or if I didn't pick up Chief, if you didn't pick up Chief G's phone call in 20 minutes, he was calling somebody else.

2153
03:17:59,183 --> 03:18:01,865
[SPEAKER_20]: So, yes, so if not Sean, call me.

2154
03:18:01,925 --> 03:18:03,046
[SPEAKER_20]: If me, call Sean.

2155
03:18:03,086 --> 03:18:05,767
[SPEAKER_20]: So are we still, yeah, the reports are there.

2156
03:18:06,548 --> 03:18:08,429
[SPEAKER_20]: What Sean, I think what we were talking about,

2157
03:18:09,084 --> 03:18:14,168
[SPEAKER_20]: as we were moving from just a very data driven report to a easier picture report.

2158
03:18:14,929 --> 03:18:16,370
[SPEAKER_20]: And that took a little bit of time.

2159
03:18:16,910 --> 03:18:19,772
[SPEAKER_20]: And a username and a log on for anybody to see.

2160
03:18:20,293 --> 03:18:21,914
[SPEAKER_20]: You can have at City Hall, I don't care.

2161
03:18:22,414 --> 03:18:28,439
[SPEAKER_20]: We want to get you the username that you can check in on our data at any time and know what your dashboard, what we would call as a dashboard.

2162
03:18:28,519 --> 03:18:29,160
[SPEAKER_09]: Was that shared?

2163
03:18:29,660 --> 03:18:30,321
[SPEAKER_09]: No, not today.

2164
03:18:30,861 --> 03:18:31,822
[SPEAKER_20]: But we would do that, yeah.

2165
03:18:32,102 --> 03:18:32,342
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

2166
03:18:32,382 --> 03:18:33,243
[SPEAKER_20]: We were willing to do that.

2167
03:18:37,610 --> 03:18:40,111
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that's a good point.

2168
03:18:40,131 --> 03:18:41,391
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that's a good point.

2169
03:18:41,531 --> 03:18:42,232
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that's a good point.

2170
03:18:42,272 --> 03:18:43,252
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that's a good point.

2171
03:18:43,272 --> 03:18:45,133
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that's a good point.

2172
03:18:45,153 --> 03:18:46,013
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that's a good point.

2173
03:18:46,033 --> 03:18:46,733
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that's a good point.

2174
03:19:03,240 --> 03:19:04,821
[SPEAKER_21]: from that piece moving forward?

2175
03:19:04,981 --> 03:19:06,322
[SPEAKER_20]: So, great question, thank you.

2176
03:19:06,382 --> 03:19:11,146
[SPEAKER_20]: So, yes, I called Mark Reich from KPLR, verbally said we agreed everything.

2177
03:19:11,827 --> 03:19:15,790
[SPEAKER_20]: We met with the chiefs, told them what the staffing pattern, and again, I have it here.

2178
03:19:16,110 --> 03:19:23,496
[SPEAKER_20]: It's an email to Mark Reich saying, hey, great meeting yesterday with the chiefs, here's everything, we agree to all, you know, every clause I said we agree to.

2179
03:19:24,056 --> 03:19:29,500
[SPEAKER_20]: Under the clauses that we had some differences, I said, you know, in the language, I'm happy to share it with you.

2180
03:19:32,083 --> 03:19:34,404
[SPEAKER_20]: let's pull out behavioral truck.

2181
03:19:34,484 --> 03:19:42,687
[SPEAKER_20]: Armstrong agrees to this, but we will have to work with Elliott Health Services, the police chief, to put the contract together to develop it.

2182
03:19:43,067 --> 03:19:43,747
[SPEAKER_20]: But we agree.

2183
03:19:44,467 --> 03:19:52,710
[SPEAKER_20]: When we talk about transporting municipal employees, that was a big discussion, not even a big discussion point, a big problem for us.

2184
03:19:53,790 --> 03:19:58,932
[SPEAKER_20]: If they are on duty, police and fire, and they get hurt on the job, we can transport them, no doubt.

2185
03:19:59,502 --> 03:20:03,645
[SPEAKER_20]: But the language was very open that says city employee to be transported to the hospital.

2186
03:20:04,185 --> 03:20:08,408
[SPEAKER_20]: We can't be taking city employees to dialysis or radiation or medical appointments.

2187
03:20:08,908 --> 03:20:09,889
[SPEAKER_20]: It had to be on the job.

2188
03:20:11,290 --> 03:20:13,872
[SPEAKER_20]: So but again the clause read that we're happy.

2189
03:20:14,052 --> 03:20:17,994
[SPEAKER_20]: We agree to the terms but the guide rail has to be put in when we talked about.

2190
03:20:20,156 --> 03:20:22,577
[SPEAKER_20]: EMT training to mock Reich.

2191
03:20:22,637 --> 03:20:24,818
[SPEAKER_20]: I said, we agree, but the guide rail has to be put in.

2192
03:20:25,859 --> 03:20:29,620
[SPEAKER_20]: It was, again, there was never a no.

2193
03:20:29,741 --> 03:20:37,964
[SPEAKER_20]: Every now and again, some of my emails were always ended, or sometimes ended with, the city still reserves the right to pick whatever ambulance company they want.

2194
03:20:38,324 --> 03:20:43,567
[SPEAKER_20]: To me, that was template, because no one was pushing back saying, no, Armstrong, we want this, we want this.

2195
03:20:44,265 --> 03:20:44,545
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

2196
03:20:44,965 --> 03:20:54,971
[SPEAKER_21]: And so it wasn't until the December 11th, December 13th timeline that you found out that we were going in a completely different direction without any response back to where you had this.

2197
03:20:55,071 --> 03:20:55,652
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

2198
03:20:55,672 --> 03:20:55,972
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

2199
03:20:55,992 --> 03:20:56,532
[SPEAKER_20]: I appreciate that.

2200
03:20:56,812 --> 03:20:58,153
[SPEAKER_20]: I still don't have a cancellation letter.

2201
03:20:59,854 --> 03:21:00,134
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

2202
03:21:03,596 --> 03:21:05,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilman Lane.

2203
03:21:06,878 --> 03:21:11,741
[SPEAKER_05]: We kind of interrupted you there with some questions if you want to finish out anything else you wanted to say.

2204
03:21:13,997 --> 03:21:18,198
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's see, I heard lack of staffing, totally not true.

2205
03:21:18,958 --> 03:21:19,839
[SPEAKER_20]: Totally not true.

2206
03:21:20,599 --> 03:21:22,980
[SPEAKER_20]: We are the incredibly staffed company.

2207
03:21:24,080 --> 03:21:27,961
[SPEAKER_20]: Lack of ambulance, and I say that because we have the Teamsters with us.

2208
03:21:28,301 --> 03:21:30,202
[SPEAKER_20]: We are a unionized workforce.

2209
03:21:30,602 --> 03:21:33,082
[SPEAKER_20]: The Teamsters have been spectacular partners.

2210
03:21:34,163 --> 03:21:35,163
[SPEAKER_20]: Once they came on board,

2211
03:21:35,743 --> 03:21:39,384
[SPEAKER_20]: We started on projects and programs to hire, to retain.

2212
03:21:39,564 --> 03:21:41,025
[SPEAKER_20]: Our numbers have never been better.

2213
03:21:41,525 --> 03:21:45,426
[SPEAKER_20]: Our training, our paramedics and EMTs, they're not just put on trucks.

2214
03:21:45,926 --> 03:21:51,228
[SPEAKER_20]: If you're working in an emergency truck in Medford, you have more training than out of school EMTs.

2215
03:21:51,848 --> 03:21:56,349
[SPEAKER_20]: It's very structured to make sure that highly competent providers are working within the city.

2216
03:21:57,370 --> 03:22:00,191
[SPEAKER_20]: So when lack of staffing, that was new to me.

2217
03:22:00,931 --> 03:22:03,392
[SPEAKER_20]: And our workforce is wonderful.

2218
03:22:03,452 --> 03:22:04,692
[SPEAKER_20]: So I appreciate, again,

2219
03:22:05,423 --> 03:22:06,644
[SPEAKER_20]: look how many people are here with us.

2220
03:22:06,684 --> 03:22:09,987
[SPEAKER_20]: So that that was that was blindsiding.

2221
03:22:10,167 --> 03:22:12,449
[SPEAKER_20]: Again no one told us if that's a concern.

2222
03:22:12,850 --> 03:22:15,372
[SPEAKER_20]: We couldn't even talk about it to explain that it's not true.

2223
03:22:16,833 --> 03:22:17,694
[SPEAKER_20]: Lack of ambulances.

2224
03:22:18,855 --> 03:22:23,839
[SPEAKER_20]: And I just the night the day I met with the mayor the day before we had 40 trucks in the city.

2225
03:22:24,440 --> 03:22:25,661
[SPEAKER_20]: So again another

2226
03:22:26,581 --> 03:22:28,422
[SPEAKER_20]: Total false statement.

2227
03:22:29,743 --> 03:22:30,363
[SPEAKER_20]: Lack of training.

2228
03:22:31,063 --> 03:22:31,984
[SPEAKER_20]: Total false statement.

2229
03:22:32,644 --> 03:22:36,987
[SPEAKER_20]: Again our folks are highly acutely trained to work our emergency trucks.

2230
03:22:38,827 --> 03:22:41,249
[SPEAKER_20]: Mutual aid were spread thin for mutual aid.

2231
03:22:41,949 --> 03:22:42,710
[SPEAKER_20]: Totally not true.

2232
03:22:43,250 --> 03:22:49,153
[SPEAKER_20]: We have 40 trucks coming in the city on that particular day and I can show you clusters of data.

2233
03:22:50,976 --> 03:22:56,280
[SPEAKER_20]: Again, this is what we look at, clusters of data to prove how many ambulances we have here at any given hour.

2234
03:22:57,681 --> 03:23:03,406
[SPEAKER_20]: And within a couple hours here or there, 10, 20 trucks have to be within the city within two hours.

2235
03:23:03,926 --> 03:23:10,051
[SPEAKER_20]: So again, another statement of lack of our mutual aid spread too thin.

2236
03:23:10,591 --> 03:23:13,293
[SPEAKER_20]: Without giving mutual aid, you don't get mutual aid.

2237
03:23:13,954 --> 03:23:16,495
[SPEAKER_20]: It's the same, it goes back and forth.

2238
03:23:17,016 --> 03:23:18,257
[SPEAKER_20]: But again, from our side,

2239
03:23:18,977 --> 03:23:23,679
[SPEAKER_20]: We do mutual aid with our own trucks, so we know the quality of people coming in here.

2240
03:23:24,040 --> 03:23:30,363
[SPEAKER_20]: We know so much about it, but because of all of the data, we know where the trucks have to be and when.

2241
03:23:32,043 --> 03:23:33,744
[SPEAKER_20]: So what else?

2242
03:23:35,585 --> 03:23:38,066
[SPEAKER_20]: Sorry, I have so many emails.

2243
03:23:48,322 --> 03:23:48,842
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, great.

2244
03:23:49,923 --> 03:23:50,543
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

2245
03:23:50,563 --> 03:23:52,204
[SPEAKER_20]: Sorry, Councilor Scarpelli.

2246
03:23:52,224 --> 03:23:53,344
[SPEAKER_20]: Apologize, Councilor.

2247
03:23:53,424 --> 03:23:54,145
[SPEAKER_20]: This is getting late.

2248
03:23:54,465 --> 03:23:55,025
[SPEAKER_20]: I apologize.

2249
03:23:55,765 --> 03:23:57,466
[SPEAKER_20]: So AEDs, yes, thank you.

2250
03:23:57,486 --> 03:23:59,087
[SPEAKER_20]: That was in the new upcoming contract.

2251
03:23:59,707 --> 03:24:06,650
[SPEAKER_20]: So the only thing that we mentioned, we have already given the city 20 to 30 AEDs.

2252
03:24:07,351 --> 03:24:11,493
[SPEAKER_20]: And the ones that we gave them are the top of the line.

2253
03:24:12,113 --> 03:24:16,575
[SPEAKER_20]: So our back on to Mark Reich was,

2254
03:24:17,592 --> 03:24:19,993
[SPEAKER_20]: We already have 30 in the city that are top of the line.

2255
03:24:20,493 --> 03:24:26,735
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll manage them, we'll maintain them, we'll put the batteries, the pads, we'll take over all the processing, servicing of them.

2256
03:24:27,396 --> 03:24:29,957
[SPEAKER_20]: If you need more, just let us know, but there's already 30.

2257
03:24:30,017 --> 03:24:32,958
[SPEAKER_20]: There's no need to buy new ones, they're the top of the line.

2258
03:24:34,098 --> 03:24:38,900
[SPEAKER_20]: If someone lost one or two or whatever, if there's some missing, just let us know, we're happy to help.

2259
03:24:46,532 --> 03:24:46,732
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

2260
03:24:47,433 --> 03:24:48,134
[SPEAKER_20]: Any other questions?

2261
03:24:49,496 --> 03:24:50,938
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have any questions from members of the council?

2262
03:24:53,360 --> 03:24:54,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli.

2263
03:24:55,221 --> 03:24:55,742
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that.

2264
03:24:55,782 --> 03:24:57,543
[SPEAKER_09]: Does this language sound familiar?

2265
03:24:57,563 --> 03:25:02,786
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this responsible contractually?

2266
03:25:04,307 --> 03:25:16,474
[SPEAKER_09]: City employees, vendors shall transport to area hospitals without charge to the patient or the city any employee of the city that requires services within the city and in the course of employment.

2267
03:25:17,675 --> 03:25:18,336
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that what you were?

2268
03:25:18,556 --> 03:25:19,856
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I was talking about, yeah.

2269
03:25:20,077 --> 03:25:22,138
[SPEAKER_09]: So that came from your contract with Waltham.

2270
03:25:23,089 --> 03:25:24,110
[SPEAKER_09]: So you never said no.

2271
03:25:24,490 --> 03:25:25,832
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I'm trying to get at.

2272
03:25:25,852 --> 03:25:33,478
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm confused where this is where I wanted that meeting with everybody at the table to say is it no or is it the language.

2273
03:25:33,719 --> 03:25:34,259
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the language.

2274
03:25:34,659 --> 03:25:34,980
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

2275
03:25:35,020 --> 03:25:36,741
[SPEAKER_20]: So just sorry.

2276
03:25:37,342 --> 03:25:45,089
[SPEAKER_20]: And why this came about is is as you can imagine times change right.

2277
03:25:45,249 --> 03:25:45,789
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh I.G.

2278
03:25:45,889 --> 03:25:47,050
[SPEAKER_20]: Medicare kickbacks.

2279
03:25:47,651 --> 03:25:49,733
[SPEAKER_20]: So all of our contracts go through

2280
03:25:50,741 --> 03:26:01,106
[SPEAKER_20]: Scott Moore, Brian Warfel, David McCool, and when we have those discussions, it's brought to our attention, hey, you need to talk to the municipality about these clauses.

2281
03:26:01,787 --> 03:26:06,449
[SPEAKER_20]: We have to suggest different language to make it legal, or we have to get it kicked out.

2282
03:26:06,829 --> 03:26:12,152
[SPEAKER_20]: Because in your own contract, the Medford contract, we're arguing over clause number 10 about payment.

2283
03:26:12,945 --> 03:26:21,133
[SPEAKER_20]: Go down a couple more, clause 13, it talks about we won't, the city will not engage anything that's against the OIG anti-kickback laws.

2284
03:26:22,074 --> 03:26:24,797
[SPEAKER_20]: It's in your own language that says we will not engage in this.

2285
03:26:31,223 --> 03:26:31,563
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

2286
03:26:31,964 --> 03:26:32,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2287
03:26:34,907 --> 03:26:36,888
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got a few things here.

2288
03:26:39,050 --> 03:26:45,474
[SPEAKER_05]: So I appreciated clarifying where you were coming from on the payments.

2289
03:26:46,335 --> 03:26:47,735
[SPEAKER_05]: If we could go a little bit more into that.

2290
03:26:47,836 --> 03:26:51,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Number one, you got a letter that said pay us $450,000.

2291
03:26:53,872 --> 03:26:57,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, you said, you never said you would never pay, right?

2292
03:26:57,393 --> 03:26:57,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that?

2293
03:26:57,714 --> 03:26:58,414
[SPEAKER_20]: Nope.

2294
03:26:58,714 --> 03:26:59,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that's your position.

2295
03:26:59,714 --> 03:27:13,280
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, just wanted to get it legalized to make sure the city, because if something went wrong, and we got, OIG came in here, the federal government, and said, whoa, this is a pay to play, they call it, or a pot sweetener.

2296
03:27:14,194 --> 03:27:23,123
[SPEAKER_20]: If that was true, because if we give you $450,000 paid in 10 days without any financials to back it up, OIG comes in here, they take our Medicare license.

2297
03:27:23,703 --> 03:27:25,144
[SPEAKER_20]: Armstrong closes the door the next day.

2298
03:27:25,545 --> 03:27:27,006
[SPEAKER_20]: That's 75% of our business.

2299
03:27:27,827 --> 03:27:29,128
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

2300
03:27:32,571 --> 03:27:33,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have that in writing?

2301
03:27:35,194 --> 03:27:35,314
[SPEAKER_20]: I do.

2302
03:27:35,454 --> 03:27:35,694
[SPEAKER_20]: Do I?

2303
03:27:35,794 --> 03:27:39,418
[SPEAKER_20]: Do we have that in writing?

2304
03:27:39,821 --> 03:27:42,763
[SPEAKER_05]: The letter from the city saying pay within 10 days.

2305
03:27:42,844 --> 03:27:43,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, I got that.

2306
03:27:43,824 --> 03:27:44,205
[SPEAKER_20]: Scott's here.

2307
03:27:44,245 --> 03:27:48,648
[SPEAKER_05]: No, yeah, just the email that came from the city that said give us $450,000 in the next 10 days.

2308
03:27:49,829 --> 03:27:51,330
[SPEAKER_20]: I can answer questions while I look, but yeah.

2309
03:27:52,071 --> 03:27:53,092
[SPEAKER_05]: You got a lot of paperwork there.

2310
03:28:11,247 --> 03:28:13,249
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's all right if you want to look and give it after.

2311
03:28:13,309 --> 03:28:16,011
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I'll look while I answer some questions, but I do have it.

2312
03:28:16,031 --> 03:28:16,411
[SPEAKER_20]: I know that.

2313
03:28:16,772 --> 03:28:17,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2314
03:28:17,492 --> 03:28:29,282
[SPEAKER_05]: My second kind of set of questions around that was it sounds like one thing you were asking for was what documentation do we legally need to get the, to pay out the back pay.

2315
03:28:29,462 --> 03:28:30,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that about right?

2316
03:28:30,924 --> 03:28:33,286
[SPEAKER_05]: You were willing to pay the 450, but you want a documentation?

2317
03:28:33,902 --> 03:28:42,288
[SPEAKER_20]: So there was a couple of suggestions that $450,000 to a healthcare organization is a lot of money, especially when it's Medicaid.

2318
03:28:42,308 --> 03:28:43,469
[SPEAKER_20]: Medicaid is most of our trips.

2319
03:28:43,889 --> 03:28:46,871
[SPEAKER_20]: We run on a very thin margin, and I explained that.

2320
03:28:46,931 --> 03:28:55,497
[SPEAKER_20]: We also write off anywhere from $500 to $1 million of billable calls in Medford so we don't bill the patient, right?

2321
03:28:55,577 --> 03:28:57,398
[SPEAKER_20]: So again, I explained that to the mayor.

2322
03:28:57,939 --> 03:29:01,061
[SPEAKER_20]: I could be billing people and taking them to court and chasing them, but

2323
03:29:02,200 --> 03:29:06,445
[SPEAKER_20]: No one in City Hall has ever received a call from a patient because Armstrong took them to court.

2324
03:29:07,146 --> 03:29:08,827
[SPEAKER_20]: We are the most humane billing company there is.

2325
03:29:11,449 --> 03:29:17,013
[SPEAKER_05]: So you just, you wouldn't have been able to pay the $450,000 in 10 days, and I guess what I'm getting at is.

2326
03:29:17,033 --> 03:29:18,554
[SPEAKER_20]: So could we have, yeah, yeah.

2327
03:29:18,754 --> 03:29:23,137
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, yeah, we're financially very stable, but it's a big ask.

2328
03:29:23,877 --> 03:29:32,322
[SPEAKER_20]: And then the next round, when we were talking to Attorney Reich and the solicitor about more payment, I'm like, we're doing this when the federal government shut down.

2329
03:29:32,983 --> 03:29:36,185
[SPEAKER_20]: We went about six weeks without getting paid for Medicare.

2330
03:29:37,041 --> 03:29:39,302
[SPEAKER_20]: but we still showed up every day and did our job.

2331
03:29:39,883 --> 03:29:42,064
[SPEAKER_20]: Like, that hurt a lot of companies with cash flow.

2332
03:29:42,784 --> 03:29:51,889
[SPEAKER_20]: So when we say, if I gave $450,000 out and then I didn't get paid for six weeks, that's why you got to, you know, we keep a rainy day fund for times like that.

2333
03:29:52,509 --> 03:29:56,812
[SPEAKER_20]: If we went, and that's where the conversation with Mark Reich went, it's like pre-COVID.

2334
03:29:57,492 --> 03:30:00,694
[SPEAKER_20]: We went, when COVID hit, we didn't do transports.

2335
03:30:00,794 --> 03:30:02,495
[SPEAKER_20]: Everybody got really well and stayed home.

2336
03:30:02,555 --> 03:30:03,735
[SPEAKER_20]: No one wanted to go to an emergency room.

2337
03:30:04,256 --> 03:30:05,056
[SPEAKER_20]: We didn't transport.

2338
03:30:05,777 --> 03:30:09,081
[SPEAKER_20]: But we kept up our contractual obligation of three and a half trucks.

2339
03:30:09,902 --> 03:30:10,923
[SPEAKER_20]: But they weren't doing anything.

2340
03:30:11,864 --> 03:30:17,450
[SPEAKER_20]: Ambulance companies were hemorrhaging money on payroll, closing up shop, just walking away.

2341
03:30:17,490 --> 03:30:18,311
[SPEAKER_20]: They couldn't handle it.

2342
03:30:18,732 --> 03:30:20,374
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank God we had money in the bank to survive.

2343
03:30:20,814 --> 03:30:20,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2344
03:30:21,515 --> 03:30:23,597
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I'm less asking from a cash flow perspective, but more

2345
03:30:24,822 --> 03:30:29,385
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it was said that you, the city asked for a payment and you said no.

2346
03:30:29,965 --> 03:30:36,570
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm asking, like, would you have worked to pay the $450,000 over some sort of schedule of time if the document?

2347
03:30:36,590 --> 03:30:37,250
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, we suggested that.

2348
03:30:37,530 --> 03:30:37,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2349
03:30:38,031 --> 03:30:39,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Over, if documentation was received?

2350
03:30:39,692 --> 03:30:40,432
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, we suggested that.

2351
03:30:40,632 --> 03:30:40,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

2352
03:30:41,393 --> 03:30:42,273
[SPEAKER_20]: Mike Rake suggested.

2353
03:30:42,293 --> 03:30:43,474
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, we suggested it with Mike Rake.

2354
03:30:43,714 --> 03:30:44,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Got it.

2355
03:30:48,717 --> 03:30:49,578
[SPEAKER_20]: I got that one right here.

2356
03:30:49,958 --> 03:30:50,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, great.

2357
03:30:53,897 --> 03:31:00,926
[SPEAKER_05]: Another thing, you know, would you be able to provide the year over year response times for Medford?

2358
03:31:00,966 --> 03:31:01,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that possible?

2359
03:31:01,987 --> 03:31:03,069
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, you want to go back 10 years?

2360
03:31:03,509 --> 03:31:04,130
[SPEAKER_05]: 10 years sounds great.

2361
03:31:04,270 --> 03:31:04,971
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, let's go 10 years.

2362
03:31:05,091 --> 03:31:05,272
[SPEAKER_20]: Great.

2363
03:31:08,418 --> 03:31:20,893
[SPEAKER_05]: In terms of the other piece of this that was brought up by the administration was that Cataldo was offering things that Armstrong didn't like EMT training at the high school, firefighter EMT training.

2364
03:31:21,514 --> 03:31:21,674
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh?

2365
03:31:21,814 --> 03:31:22,575
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll just stop you there.

2366
03:31:22,615 --> 03:31:22,936
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sorry.

2367
03:31:22,976 --> 03:31:23,637
[SPEAKER_20]: I shouldn't do that, right?

2368
03:31:23,657 --> 03:31:24,418
[SPEAKER_05]: You shouldn't interrupt me.

2369
03:31:24,458 --> 03:31:25,339
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's a bad call.

2370
03:31:28,567 --> 03:31:29,607
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll finish my question.

2371
03:31:30,687 --> 03:31:40,690
[SPEAKER_05]: So they listed EMT training at the high school, firefighter trainings to be EMTs, extra equipment at fire scenes, and new training opportunities.

2372
03:31:41,310 --> 03:31:51,632
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, since this was also, in addition to looking back at the contract and all the provisions that we're talking about, it's also multiple bids and companies were considered here.

2373
03:31:54,259 --> 03:32:00,501
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a reason that Cataldo offered those and you didn't, or did you offer those, or what's your perspective on that as part of the negotiation?

2374
03:32:01,261 --> 03:32:01,861
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, God.

2375
03:32:03,262 --> 03:32:04,982
[SPEAKER_20]: A few years ago, this one I don't have.

2376
03:32:05,062 --> 03:32:07,343
[SPEAKER_20]: I probably could still research my calendar and find it.

2377
03:32:10,124 --> 03:32:16,746
[SPEAKER_20]: Several years ago, we met with the former principal, Heidi Reich, I believe her name was.

2378
03:32:17,366 --> 03:32:18,106
[SPEAKER_20]: Yep.

2379
03:32:18,867 --> 03:32:22,808
[SPEAKER_20]: And Jill Sawyer, I think, was her assistant principal maybe.

2380
03:32:23,715 --> 03:32:35,057
[SPEAKER_20]: We met with them and talked and tried to put together an EMT program for the tech side of the school, but to fold it into the curriculum, it was way too difficult.

2381
03:32:36,018 --> 03:32:46,760
[SPEAKER_20]: And then there was a problem with, at the time, we were ununionized labor coming in to teach the program, but we offered to do the program at the high school and there was a problem.

2382
03:32:46,820 --> 03:32:49,580
[SPEAKER_20]: So yes, we totally agreed to do it.

2383
03:32:49,980 --> 03:32:52,881
[SPEAKER_20]: Now that we're a unionized workforce, probably be a lot easier now.

2384
03:32:54,507 --> 03:32:55,288
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

2385
03:32:55,988 --> 03:32:57,770
[SPEAKER_05]: On the firefighter EMT training?

2386
03:32:58,510 --> 03:32:58,691
[SPEAKER_20]: Yep.

2387
03:32:58,831 --> 03:32:59,811
[SPEAKER_20]: We agreed to it.

2388
03:33:00,292 --> 03:33:00,952
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

2389
03:33:01,093 --> 03:33:03,815
[SPEAKER_20]: Just didn't want to do it in our building.

2390
03:33:03,835 --> 03:33:06,037
[SPEAKER_20]: We were going to outsource it to a company.

2391
03:33:08,478 --> 03:33:15,824
[SPEAKER_20]: that we do a lot of work with just so we like to outsource it just so we're clean of any of the paperwork holding or any of that.

2392
03:33:16,364 --> 03:33:24,990
[SPEAKER_20]: And the person who owns the company is a firefighter, a fire chief and works well with other fire departments but he's worked with us on other projects like that.

2393
03:33:25,331 --> 03:33:25,511
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

2394
03:33:25,631 --> 03:33:29,554
[SPEAKER_05]: And then this new training opportunities and extra equipment at fire scenes?

2395
03:33:33,035 --> 03:33:35,378
[SPEAKER_20]: So we do that differently.

2396
03:33:35,999 --> 03:33:39,004
[SPEAKER_20]: There's a company called Sparks Sparks is.

2397
03:33:40,763 --> 03:33:56,748
[SPEAKER_20]: It is a volunteer service based in Boston, and every time we go to fires larger than, and Sean can speak to this if you wanna ask Sean, but greater than two or three alarms, we, from our dispatch general, we go immediately and start rehab.

2398
03:33:56,808 --> 03:34:00,289
[SPEAKER_20]: For us, rehab is medicine, it's not food and hot dogs.

2399
03:34:00,749 --> 03:34:03,029
[SPEAKER_20]: We look at the rehab from the medicine side.

2400
03:34:03,449 --> 03:34:08,371
[SPEAKER_20]: And then when we want, if it's gonna be a long sustained major catastrophe,

2401
03:34:09,051 --> 03:34:14,614
[SPEAKER_20]: And we have to bring in those services greater than medical for food and hydration.

2402
03:34:14,654 --> 03:34:16,715
[SPEAKER_20]: We work with what they call the sparks out of Boston.

2403
03:34:17,235 --> 03:34:19,536
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think we do that after the third alarm.

2404
03:34:20,216 --> 03:34:21,056
[SPEAKER_20]: But those guys are great.

2405
03:34:21,096 --> 03:34:24,378
[SPEAKER_20]: They come any time we call and they provide

2406
03:34:25,088 --> 03:34:28,972
[SPEAKER_20]: hot food cold drinks and hot chocolate in the winter.

2407
03:34:29,112 --> 03:34:29,913
[SPEAKER_20]: They are wonderful.

2408
03:34:30,314 --> 03:34:31,375
[SPEAKER_20]: Again it's not a service.

2409
03:34:32,136 --> 03:34:34,638
[SPEAKER_20]: We specialize in one thing taking care of sick people.

2410
03:34:34,819 --> 03:34:35,539
[SPEAKER_20]: That's our mission.

2411
03:34:36,240 --> 03:34:39,604
[SPEAKER_20]: And we work well with other groups that do their mission better than us.

2412
03:34:41,278 --> 03:34:41,518
[SPEAKER_05]: Got it.

2413
03:34:41,678 --> 03:34:41,958
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

2414
03:34:43,619 --> 03:34:57,524
[SPEAKER_05]: The last thing I wanted to ask about was there was basically three things that were mentioned that in the March 2025 meeting, it was said that, that was characterized that Armstrong wouldn't honor these provisions of the contract.

2415
03:34:58,064 --> 03:34:59,844
[SPEAKER_05]: It was one, the payments and reimbursements.

2416
03:35:00,044 --> 03:35:02,545
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we've gone over that pretty extensively.

2417
03:35:03,086 --> 03:35:06,547
[SPEAKER_05]: The other two were that you were gonna start charging the city for EMD.

2418
03:35:06,727 --> 03:35:07,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

2419
03:35:07,485 --> 03:35:07,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2420
03:35:07,886 --> 03:35:08,847
[SPEAKER_05]: Could you explain that a little bit?

2421
03:35:09,007 --> 03:35:09,348
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

2422
03:35:09,488 --> 03:35:10,069
[SPEAKER_20]: Forgot about that.

2423
03:35:11,270 --> 03:35:14,635
[SPEAKER_20]: EMD, we never said we were going to charge the city for EMD.

2424
03:35:15,396 --> 03:35:19,241
[SPEAKER_20]: What we said was, again, from a medical compliance,

2425
03:35:21,130 --> 03:35:24,653
[SPEAKER_20]: federal compliance of kickback, that's the whole goal.

2426
03:35:24,753 --> 03:35:28,737
[SPEAKER_20]: And I just, it was very, let's get the attorneys to agree how to do this correctly.

2427
03:35:29,237 --> 03:35:33,061
[SPEAKER_20]: And all the other cities and towns we work with, we charge them.

2428
03:35:33,501 --> 03:35:37,325
[SPEAKER_20]: There's a handful that we don't charge, and that's because

2429
03:35:38,758 --> 03:35:50,851
[SPEAKER_20]: ProAmbulance provides, it's a long story, but we get paid in lieu through ProAmbulance for providing the services on the communities that they cover with their ambulances.

2430
03:35:51,552 --> 03:35:56,277
[SPEAKER_20]: But any community that we serve, Saugus, Stoneham, Melrose, it's a pass through.

2431
03:35:56,737 --> 03:35:58,419
[SPEAKER_20]: We build Melrose.

2432
03:35:59,460 --> 03:36:08,289
[SPEAKER_20]: $25,000 Melrose submits that bill to state 9-1-1 state 9-1-1 pays it and then the city pays us back that money It's a pass-through.

2433
03:36:08,669 --> 03:36:24,424
[SPEAKER_20]: There was no ever and I think I was pretty Open that if if the pass-through didn't work in the city for whatever reason we're still not going to charge the city we haven't charged the city since we bought the equipment for the city

2434
03:36:27,603 --> 03:36:28,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

2435
03:36:28,564 --> 03:36:33,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Last one was the first responder change for transport.

2436
03:36:33,208 --> 03:36:36,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Was that something that you were going to immediately start changing just to do police and fire on scene?

2437
03:36:37,011 --> 03:36:37,051
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

2438
03:36:37,391 --> 03:36:38,612
[SPEAKER_05]: That was for the next contract?

2439
03:36:39,473 --> 03:36:39,753
[SPEAKER_20]: Correct.

2440
03:36:39,833 --> 03:36:42,475
[SPEAKER_20]: We just wanted to legalize the language to make sure it was compliant.

2441
03:36:42,795 --> 03:36:43,036
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

2442
03:36:43,356 --> 03:36:43,516
[SPEAKER_20]: Yep.

2443
03:36:44,216 --> 03:36:44,757
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

2444
03:36:44,777 --> 03:36:45,598
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all my questions.

2445
03:36:47,979 --> 03:36:48,540
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have any more?

2446
03:36:48,560 --> 03:36:49,180
[SPEAKER_09]: I just have one.

2447
03:36:49,220 --> 03:36:50,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli.

2448
03:36:53,197 --> 03:36:57,581
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to call anybody that they weren't telling the truth, they weren't honest.

2449
03:36:58,842 --> 03:37:14,975
[SPEAKER_09]: All I want to say in the 12th hour, Rich, is anybody other than people on your staff, anybody in this room to answer questions, present when you unveiled the final presentation?

2450
03:37:16,116 --> 03:37:16,436
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry?

2451
03:37:17,077 --> 03:37:22,121
[SPEAKER_09]: The final presentation of the contract where everything was in line and ready to go.

2452
03:37:23,602 --> 03:37:31,308
[SPEAKER_09]: Was the chief, chief of staff, Mr. Salve, anybody present that's in this room?

2453
03:37:31,488 --> 03:37:39,594
[SPEAKER_20]: My last email to Mark Reich was with the proposed contractual language to us where I said, we agree to all this.

2454
03:37:39,795 --> 03:37:42,837
[SPEAKER_20]: Here are the four or five things that we need clarification on.

2455
03:37:43,778 --> 03:37:45,079
[SPEAKER_20]: And nothing after that.

2456
03:37:45,579 --> 03:37:45,879
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

2457
03:37:45,959 --> 03:37:47,100
[SPEAKER_05]: And was that just with you and him?

2458
03:37:48,141 --> 03:37:49,422
[SPEAKER_20]: Correct.

2459
03:37:49,522 --> 03:37:51,383
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, and our attorney, David McCool.

2460
03:37:51,403 --> 03:37:51,964
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, thanks.

2461
03:37:52,836 --> 03:37:59,500
[SPEAKER_09]: So in conclusion with this whole process, the questions of response time, you have documentation.

2462
03:38:00,540 --> 03:38:07,964
[SPEAKER_09]: With questions of the meetings and the responses from the contractual, you share the information.

2463
03:38:08,945 --> 03:38:21,392
[SPEAKER_09]: Your team, when they talk about transition, because this is more important to me, Mr. President, I know that we have people that want to speak, but I think the most important piece is the next piece, and that is are we prepared for the transition?

2464
03:38:22,269 --> 03:38:26,831
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe Mr. Salve said that you were part of, Armstrong was part of this transition.

2465
03:38:27,392 --> 03:38:33,075
[SPEAKER_09]: So when I hear that all you got was an email saying that you're moving on.

2466
03:38:33,775 --> 03:38:40,879
[SPEAKER_09]: You haven't met with a system in place to prepare Cataldo to let them know what's going on, or have you done that on your own?

2467
03:38:40,959 --> 03:38:41,499
[SPEAKER_20]: I have not.

2468
03:38:41,599 --> 03:38:49,223
[SPEAKER_20]: I know Sean's had some conversations, but my learning that it was officially and it was going to Cataldo is when Dennis Cataldo called me and said,

2469
03:38:50,346 --> 03:38:53,510
[SPEAKER_20]: what's going on over there, we had to sign a document that we have to contract.

2470
03:38:54,170 --> 03:38:56,212
[SPEAKER_09]: And I appreciate that, Mr. Raymond.

2471
03:38:56,252 --> 03:39:12,310
[SPEAKER_09]: But Mr. President, to my colleagues, I think this is where we have to look at the fiscal responsibility of this piece, not just the money that we're losing because of this situation, but also understanding if Cataldo is providing any of those funding mechanisms.

2472
03:39:12,932 --> 03:39:14,513
[SPEAKER_09]: that we were getting from Armstrong.

2473
03:39:14,853 --> 03:39:21,155
[SPEAKER_09]: The other piece was, what did we just hear of the negotiation process?

2474
03:39:22,576 --> 03:39:32,660
[SPEAKER_09]: How much money did we spend to KP Law, to our city staff, and hours to negotiate contracts that seemed to have gone awry back in April?

2475
03:39:33,570 --> 03:39:34,551
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a lot of money.

2476
03:39:35,291 --> 03:39:51,724
[SPEAKER_09]: And these are the things that the transparency of this process brings forward because what we're seeing, Mr. Raymond, what we're seeing throughout the community are some serious issues that we'll have to move forward as a council and really dig deeper in making sure that we are true stewards of our fiscal responsibility.

2477
03:39:52,124 --> 03:40:13,155
[SPEAKER_09]: and the finances of this community, because as you're talking, I'm doing the figures and can only imagine what it costs for KP Law, what it costs for Man House, for our city solicitor, who's now gone, by the way, what it costs for our staff, our, you know, even Chief's team to put together some numbers yesterday.

2478
03:40:13,836 --> 03:40:21,580
[SPEAKER_09]: This is stuff to me that it's befuddling to me, because I have yet to hear the why

2479
03:40:22,588 --> 03:40:24,930
[SPEAKER_09]: when it comes to changing over to Cataldo.

2480
03:40:25,851 --> 03:40:30,275
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is the reason why I wanted that one more meeting because maybe I'm wrong.

2481
03:40:30,295 --> 03:40:37,161
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe I'm looking at it in different glasses because I mentioned that this is personal to me because of the situation I've gone through personally.

2482
03:40:38,262 --> 03:40:43,007
[SPEAKER_09]: But why can't we see that this isn't a good fit to change?

2483
03:40:44,248 --> 03:40:46,210
[SPEAKER_09]: Why can't we take a deep breath and stop?

2484
03:40:49,598 --> 03:40:52,383
[SPEAKER_09]: and say that, you know what, let's sit down at the table tomorrow.

2485
03:40:52,763 --> 03:40:54,766
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see if we could still move forward this process.

2486
03:40:55,227 --> 03:40:57,911
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get it done so we don't interrupt and interfere.

2487
03:40:57,931 --> 03:41:04,382
[SPEAKER_09]: Because the next part, Mr. President, I'm hearing where we're going to be housing Cataldo.

2488
03:41:05,777 --> 03:41:07,478
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm hearing fire stations.

2489
03:41:07,538 --> 03:41:14,401
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm hearing that our water safety apparatus might be moved so they can house ambulances.

2490
03:41:14,722 --> 03:41:17,363
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm hearing trailers behind engines.

2491
03:41:17,443 --> 03:41:18,784
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm hearing trailers.

2492
03:41:19,584 --> 03:41:21,125
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that showing that we're ready?

2493
03:41:21,865 --> 03:41:26,188
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we know that we have they have enough staffing to cover the city?

2494
03:41:26,708 --> 03:41:27,408
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we know that?

2495
03:41:28,029 --> 03:41:29,229
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a process in place?

2496
03:41:29,549 --> 03:41:42,537
[SPEAKER_09]: There's so many, so many issues that I think that still is so open ended that at least can we slow the process down to make sure all of these issues because there is no way that as a professional,

2497
03:41:43,490 --> 03:41:51,992
[SPEAKER_09]: working for municipality that I see that we can get things working in a few days, that the transition from what it was said earlier, it's gonna be seamless, gonna be seamless transition.

2498
03:41:53,272 --> 03:41:55,472
[SPEAKER_09]: Do our firefighters know if it is true?

2499
03:41:55,953 --> 03:41:56,633
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we know?

2500
03:41:57,033 --> 03:41:57,893
[SPEAKER_09]: Do they know that?

2501
03:41:58,753 --> 03:42:08,135
[SPEAKER_09]: How is the process gonna go that there's gonna be ambulances in a bay with non union companies in a union house with a trailer in the backyard that

2502
03:42:09,890 --> 03:42:11,111
[SPEAKER_09]: Do they have bathrooms in those trailers?

2503
03:42:11,131 --> 03:42:13,172
[SPEAKER_09]: Are they coming into the firehouse?

2504
03:42:13,613 --> 03:42:17,235
[SPEAKER_09]: These are things that have to be said so we know if we're ready.

2505
03:42:18,556 --> 03:42:23,519
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that alone, just that small issue is huge as we move forward.

2506
03:42:24,799 --> 03:42:27,181
[SPEAKER_09]: That tells me we're not ready for this move.

2507
03:42:28,561 --> 03:42:30,843
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, it's going to put people at risk.

2508
03:42:32,097 --> 03:42:37,221
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's not minimizing what our firefighters and police officers do because we have total trust in them.

2509
03:42:37,641 --> 03:42:51,853
[SPEAKER_09]: But I tell you, I've talked to many method firefighters off the record, and I tell you one constant message is when they're on a when they're on a life saving call, the relief they get when Armstrong comes through that door.

2510
03:42:53,194 --> 03:42:53,954
[SPEAKER_09]: That's enough for me.

2511
03:42:55,796 --> 03:42:56,957
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that we should

2512
03:42:57,871 --> 03:43:05,336
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, that this is something that I hope the mayor we could implore to the mayor that we at least slow this process down.

2513
03:43:05,356 --> 03:43:13,141
[SPEAKER_09]: And one thing that Armstrong has said from beginning, which they're a lot bigger than us, is they're okay.

2514
03:43:14,162 --> 03:43:15,203
[SPEAKER_09]: We're still gonna be here.

2515
03:43:16,023 --> 03:43:17,784
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not gonna turn our backs to Medford.

2516
03:43:18,365 --> 03:43:19,305
[SPEAKER_09]: We're still gonna be here.

2517
03:43:20,006 --> 03:43:20,526
[SPEAKER_09]: That enough.

2518
03:43:20,806 --> 03:43:21,467
[SPEAKER_09]: That says enough.

2519
03:43:22,658 --> 03:43:27,001
[SPEAKER_09]: So because right now I have questions about certifications.

2520
03:43:27,482 --> 03:43:39,411
[SPEAKER_09]: I know I brought up the other day about the PALS program and that's a certification for pediatric certifications which is probably what I hear is the high end of training.

2521
03:43:40,212 --> 03:43:41,653
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to know if Cataldo has that.

2522
03:43:42,033 --> 03:43:43,774
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to know what other training they have.

2523
03:43:44,115 --> 03:43:46,837
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to know who is in an ambulance.

2524
03:43:47,657 --> 03:43:52,858
[SPEAKER_09]: if they're, what is it, paramedics or if they're EMTs, how we're staffing that.

2525
03:43:53,298 --> 03:43:56,059
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanna know if they're covering zones or they're gonna be in the areas.

2526
03:43:56,339 --> 03:44:02,940
[SPEAKER_09]: There are so many issues now that thanks to this process, I can now go to work for any ambulance company in the country.

2527
03:44:03,920 --> 03:44:09,241
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I know this, once I fix the EMD thing, I haven't made a mistake since.

2528
03:44:10,701 --> 03:44:14,682
[SPEAKER_09]: But again, I'm gonna reiterate the fact that I trust our chiefs.

2529
03:44:16,098 --> 03:44:17,979
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it might not sound it to them right now.

2530
03:44:18,059 --> 03:44:21,640
[SPEAKER_09]: I know my chiefs are angry with me because that's been stated behind my back.

2531
03:44:23,100 --> 03:44:24,421
[SPEAKER_09]: I trust them immensely.

2532
03:44:25,481 --> 03:44:35,844
[SPEAKER_09]: But I also know working for a mayor in a municipality, it's very difficult to say no to your boss, even when it's the right thing to do.

2533
03:44:37,865 --> 03:44:38,005
[SPEAKER_09]: So

2534
03:44:39,143 --> 03:44:40,085
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2535
03:44:40,105 --> 03:44:43,130
[SPEAKER_09]: I know we have more questions, but I've talked enough.

2536
03:44:43,491 --> 03:44:44,994
[SPEAKER_09]: I know people might have some questions.

2537
03:44:45,214 --> 03:44:45,895
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I do a follow-up?

2538
03:44:46,156 --> 03:44:46,997
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead, Rich.

2539
03:44:48,660 --> 03:44:49,702
[SPEAKER_20]: Go ahead.

2540
03:44:49,882 --> 03:44:50,143
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

2541
03:44:53,813 --> 03:44:58,354
[SPEAKER_20]: One thing I wanted, like someone show me a couple screenshots of, oh, it's just another ambulance company, who cares?

2542
03:44:59,395 --> 03:45:01,535
[SPEAKER_20]: Armstrong is gonna go work for Cataldo.

2543
03:45:02,236 --> 03:45:04,356
[SPEAKER_20]: That to me is horrible to say.

2544
03:45:05,537 --> 03:45:07,417
[SPEAKER_20]: Our staff loves working for Armstrong.

2545
03:45:09,418 --> 03:45:18,001
[SPEAKER_20]: They show up every day in Medford or wherever they're working for the day, but let's talk about Medford, and they feel that they are Medford EMS.

2546
03:45:19,041 --> 03:45:22,083
[SPEAKER_20]: The paycheck comes from us, but they feel that they're the fabric of Medford.

2547
03:45:22,103 --> 03:45:27,347
[SPEAKER_20]: So when I hear, oh, they'll just go work for the other company, that's furthest from the truth.

2548
03:45:28,647 --> 03:45:32,910
[SPEAKER_20]: Our guys and gals, when you say that, there's other things to think about.

2549
03:45:33,391 --> 03:45:45,559
[SPEAKER_20]: With 10 years of tenure, five years of tenure, and all the PTO that they've accrued, the 401k that we do a high match at, the partnership with the Teamsters and the healthcare we offer,

2550
03:45:46,499 --> 03:45:52,682
[SPEAKER_20]: I would say we offer the best benefits around, no doubt.

2551
03:45:53,062 --> 03:45:55,984
[SPEAKER_20]: So to say, oh, just up and leave a company, that's awful.

2552
03:45:56,344 --> 03:45:57,204
[SPEAKER_20]: We don't want them to leave.

2553
03:45:57,804 --> 03:45:58,545
[SPEAKER_20]: They're our partners.

2554
03:45:59,125 --> 03:46:01,986
[SPEAKER_20]: No way, I really took offense when I saw that on the social media.

2555
03:46:02,026 --> 03:46:06,889
[SPEAKER_20]: So we are proud to be Medford, and we would love to stay in Medford.

2556
03:46:07,369 --> 03:46:10,831
[SPEAKER_20]: And this just really came down to an argument that didn't need to happen.

2557
03:46:13,752 --> 03:46:14,953
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, thank you, Mr. Raymond.

2558
03:46:15,193 --> 03:46:15,713
[SPEAKER_20]: Good, thank you.

2559
03:46:17,774 --> 03:46:17,994
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2560
03:46:19,135 --> 03:46:27,502
[SPEAKER_05]: At this point, I really appreciate folks sticking around for a while.

2561
03:46:28,283 --> 03:46:29,964
[SPEAKER_05]: We're happy to open the floor.

2562
03:46:30,405 --> 03:46:35,089
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, actually, you know, we haven't heard from, and I did say this, I see a representative from Local 25 here.

2563
03:46:35,269 --> 03:46:40,854
[SPEAKER_05]: If you wanted to say anything on behalf of the union and the workers, and then we'll open it up to public participation.

2564
03:46:40,874 --> 03:46:43,216
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe you could just give your name and address, please.

2565
03:46:44,038 --> 03:46:46,821
[SPEAKER_01]: Nancy Campbell, I'm a business agent with Teamster's Local 25.

2566
03:46:46,861 --> 03:46:48,603
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

2567
03:46:49,063 --> 03:46:50,945
[SPEAKER_01]: I just prepared a little bit for you.

2568
03:46:50,965 --> 03:46:55,830
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have some comments after what I've just witnessed the last three and a half hours.

2569
03:46:58,523 --> 03:47:03,968
[SPEAKER_01]: I've negotiated the Armstrong contract, represented them since February of 2023.

2570
03:47:04,589 --> 03:47:06,671
[SPEAKER_01]: These union members have a voice at the table.

2571
03:47:07,391 --> 03:47:15,359
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as they organize themselves, we immediately worked on policies mandating additional field training hours for all new EMS providers.

2572
03:47:15,819 --> 03:47:21,785
[SPEAKER_01]: These policies ensure that these new providers receive extra training and assessment before working regular 911 shift.

2573
03:47:22,906 --> 03:47:27,848
[SPEAKER_01]: That means Armstrong doesn't hire brand new EMS providers and throws them on an ambulance.

2574
03:47:27,908 --> 03:47:32,851
[SPEAKER_01]: They must successfully complete all aspects of the training outlined in the policies.

2575
03:47:33,851 --> 03:47:35,432
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the members who pushed for that.

2576
03:47:38,790 --> 03:47:42,412
[SPEAKER_01]: training for the field training officers who train all these new employees.

2577
03:47:43,292 --> 03:47:55,738
[SPEAKER_01]: A union workforce means employees have a voice to mandate stronger policies so they are better trained to provide better life-saving care and a voice to hold Armstrong accountable for those policies.

2578
03:47:56,665 --> 03:47:58,547
[SPEAKER_01]: What does Cataldo policy say?

2579
03:47:59,107 --> 03:48:00,168
[SPEAKER_01]: I urge you to find out.

2580
03:48:00,488 --> 03:48:06,333
[SPEAKER_01]: And who's there making sure that they follow those policies, not their EMS workers who do not have a voice?

2581
03:48:07,153 --> 03:48:09,575
[SPEAKER_01]: Our members have additional driving training.

2582
03:48:10,036 --> 03:48:16,301
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, we're currently working on a driving program within the Teamsters Driving School that would mirror EVOC training.

2583
03:48:16,601 --> 03:48:18,863
[SPEAKER_01]: It's emergency vehicle operating courses.

2584
03:48:19,643 --> 03:48:34,760
[SPEAKER_01]: EVOC is specialized driver training for police, fire, and EMS personnel to safely and effectively operate emergency vehicles, focusing on defensive driving, hazardous avoidance, intersection control, through classroom instruction, and hands-on practice.

2585
03:48:35,281 --> 03:48:40,967
[SPEAKER_01]: It's critical for preventing accidents and ensuring drivers can handle emergency situations.

2586
03:48:42,925 --> 03:48:45,607
[SPEAKER_01]: What specialized training does Cataldo provide?

2587
03:48:46,348 --> 03:48:54,915
[SPEAKER_01]: These are just a few things that Armstrong does above and beyond to make their employees, as well as all the residents here, care for in a safer manner.

2588
03:48:58,217 --> 03:49:01,878
[SPEAKER_01]: They take saving lives seriously, unlike the mayor apparently.

2589
03:49:02,259 --> 03:49:06,580
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not surprised at the lack of transparency that she and her office has shown.

2590
03:49:07,140 --> 03:49:10,861
[SPEAKER_01]: She continuously bases her decisions on her own personal grudges.

2591
03:49:11,261 --> 03:49:16,982
[SPEAKER_01]: Her constant incompetence to make good professional decisions could now have dire consequences.

2592
03:49:17,663 --> 03:49:22,484
[SPEAKER_01]: This is such an important decision, and for her to do it behind closed doors raises red flags.

2593
03:49:23,620 --> 03:49:28,621
[SPEAKER_01]: After listening to the chief of staff and the chiefs here tonight, I'm even more worried.

2594
03:49:28,921 --> 03:49:36,503
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys called this meeting, you're asking these questions, and not one person from the mayor's office was sent to actually answer.

2595
03:49:37,324 --> 03:49:41,545
[SPEAKER_01]: Not one person that were in those negotiations on her side was here tonight.

2596
03:49:42,845 --> 03:49:48,287
[SPEAKER_01]: If the mayor has dismissed Armstrong because she disdained for unions, especially Local 25,

2597
03:49:50,192 --> 03:49:54,316
[SPEAKER_01]: Then her personal grudges could have deadly consequences for residents of Medford.

2598
03:49:54,496 --> 03:49:56,237
[SPEAKER_01]: She is gambling with people's lives.

2599
03:49:56,998 --> 03:50:02,483
[SPEAKER_01]: I urge the City Council to do your due diligence in finding out what really happened behind closed doors.

2600
03:50:02,983 --> 03:50:09,149
[SPEAKER_01]: Find out why Swampscott, Moblehead, Stoneham, Danvis, Newton, Waltham and Wellesley fired Cataldo.

2601
03:50:09,909 --> 03:50:14,854
[SPEAKER_01]: I take protecting my members very seriously, in the workplace but also in everyday life.

2602
03:50:15,194 --> 03:50:16,015
[SPEAKER_01]: We are family.

2603
03:50:17,372 --> 03:50:24,719
[SPEAKER_01]: We have hundreds of members here in Medford, and if any of them are harmed because of this decision, she won't be able to hide behind that closed door.

2604
03:50:25,039 --> 03:50:26,420
[SPEAKER_01]: She will be held accountable.

2605
03:50:26,881 --> 03:50:27,221
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

2606
03:50:33,199 --> 03:50:36,240
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, go to public participation.

2607
03:50:37,040 --> 03:50:41,280
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to alternate between in-person and on Zoom.

2608
03:50:41,301 --> 03:50:43,721
[SPEAKER_05]: If you'd like to speak in person, you can line up behind the podium.

2609
03:50:43,761 --> 03:50:46,261
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're on Zoom, you can raise your hand on Zoom.

2610
03:50:46,521 --> 03:50:51,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Folks will have three minutes to speak, and we'll start at the podium with Mr. Jones.

2611
03:50:52,963 --> 03:50:54,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Name and address for the record, please.

2612
03:50:54,623 --> 03:50:54,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.

2613
03:50:55,003 --> 03:50:55,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Bob Jones, 5 St.

2614
03:50:56,003 --> 03:50:59,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Mary Street, Medford, Mass., firefighter, local 1032E board.

2615
03:51:01,580 --> 03:51:05,844
[SPEAKER_03]: Just for the record, the union was not invited to any of these negotiations.

2616
03:51:06,524 --> 03:51:08,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Local 1032 was not asked for any input.

2617
03:51:10,127 --> 03:51:11,608
[SPEAKER_03]: We request that in the future.

2618
03:51:11,628 --> 03:51:17,933
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe that the people who are actually going on these calls, providing this service, should be represented at the table.

2619
03:51:18,729 --> 03:51:20,831
[SPEAKER_03]: which are represented in this room.

2620
03:51:20,871 --> 03:51:22,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Jones, if you could just speak to that.

2621
03:51:22,633 --> 03:51:23,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry about that.

2622
03:51:23,214 --> 03:51:23,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, thank you.

2623
03:51:23,734 --> 03:51:27,378
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to address the rank and file and the people that actually do the work here.

2624
03:51:27,458 --> 03:51:27,698
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

2625
03:51:27,879 --> 03:51:30,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a paid gun from KP Law.

2626
03:51:30,381 --> 03:51:31,803
[SPEAKER_03]: We just couldn't hear you.

2627
03:51:32,744 --> 03:51:35,547
[SPEAKER_03]: We should be the ones at the negotiating table, number one.

2628
03:51:36,608 --> 03:51:41,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Number two, this rollout is going to happen in less than a week.

2629
03:51:42,273 --> 03:51:52,635
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hearing that we have trailers behind fire stations and ambulances in the fire stations replacing the ice and water equipment, ice and water rescue equipment that we currently have.

2630
03:51:53,495 --> 03:51:58,976
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe the chief can speak to that rollout, but apparently he just left the room.

2631
03:52:00,756 --> 03:52:01,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Love to see how it's going to go.

2632
03:52:01,816 --> 03:52:03,537
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's only housing for two ambulances.

2633
03:52:03,657 --> 03:52:09,058
[SPEAKER_03]: We currently have three to four to five ambulances in the city at any given time.

2634
03:52:09,798 --> 03:52:10,538
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's just two.

2635
03:52:11,829 --> 03:52:15,450
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing was it would be nice to look at the contract with Cataldo.

2636
03:52:16,451 --> 03:52:20,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Has anybody by a show of hands in this room seen the contract with Cataldo?

2637
03:52:22,053 --> 03:52:22,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody?

2638
03:52:22,993 --> 03:52:24,413
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it provided to the city council?

2639
03:52:25,674 --> 03:52:26,374
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't seen it.

2640
03:52:26,814 --> 03:52:27,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli.

2641
03:52:28,455 --> 03:52:28,995
[SPEAKER_09]: I apologize.

2642
03:52:29,455 --> 03:52:31,616
[SPEAKER_05]: I requested it by email and verbally.

2643
03:52:32,336 --> 03:52:33,277
[SPEAKER_09]: That we do see that?

2644
03:52:33,577 --> 03:52:33,757
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

2645
03:52:33,777 --> 03:52:33,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2646
03:52:34,057 --> 03:52:34,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2647
03:52:35,137 --> 03:52:37,318
[SPEAKER_05]: If you could continue with your comment, I don't want you to run out of your time.

2648
03:52:37,623 --> 03:52:38,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, no, not a problem.

2649
03:52:38,983 --> 03:52:39,783
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll try to be brief.

2650
03:52:40,264 --> 03:52:51,166
[SPEAKER_03]: The, like I said, it would be nice to compare and contrast the new contract that they say is well better than the Armstrong contract to see if that's actually true.

2651
03:52:52,266 --> 03:52:52,866
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to see it.

2652
03:52:52,906 --> 03:52:53,746
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had two meetings.

2653
03:52:53,786 --> 03:52:58,647
[SPEAKER_03]: We have multiple hours talking about a contract that the administration has not provided to anybody.

2654
03:52:59,787 --> 03:53:01,527
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how that's transparency.

2655
03:53:02,628 --> 03:53:04,148
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to see what's in it.

2656
03:53:05,095 --> 03:53:06,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I thank you for this forum.

2657
03:53:06,536 --> 03:53:11,799
[SPEAKER_03]: I thank the members of Armstrong for their dedicated service throughout the years.

2658
03:53:12,319 --> 03:53:23,785
[SPEAKER_03]: And they didn't deserve this type of treatment and this type of basic disrespect for the company, for the employees in this process.

2659
03:53:24,125 --> 03:53:24,786
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

2660
03:53:24,806 --> 03:53:27,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

2661
03:53:32,948 --> 03:53:35,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing no hands on Zoom, we'll stay at the podium.

2662
03:53:35,913 --> 03:53:37,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Former Council President Rick Caraviello.

2663
03:53:37,795 --> 03:53:38,597
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2664
03:53:38,637 --> 03:53:40,920
[SPEAKER_17]: Rick Caraviello, 74 Prescott Street, Medford.

2665
03:53:42,002 --> 03:53:47,410
[SPEAKER_17]: Unfortunately, I've had to use Armstrong Ambulance for my cell phone.

2666
03:53:48,287 --> 03:53:55,232
[SPEAKER_17]: a few occasions, and between them and our fire departments, and some of them are here who've carried me out of my house.

2667
03:53:56,012 --> 03:53:57,193
[SPEAKER_17]: We won't mention any names.

2668
03:53:58,374 --> 03:54:04,498
[SPEAKER_17]: Armstrong has been there, has provided professional service along with our police and fire.

2669
03:54:04,758 --> 03:54:07,940
[SPEAKER_17]: But I'm not here for that, because that's their job and that's what they do.

2670
03:54:08,861 --> 03:54:11,963
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm here because I'm a past president of the Metro Kiwanis.

2671
03:54:12,604 --> 03:54:17,647
[SPEAKER_17]: And over the years, Armstrong Ambulance, through Sean Mannion,

2672
03:54:18,006 --> 03:54:25,549
[SPEAKER_17]: has provided probably a dozen times certification for CPR to the whole organization.

2673
03:54:26,910 --> 03:54:39,995
[SPEAKER_17]: They've provided first aid training to our entire organization on many occasions, along with choking techniques and how to perform the Heimlich.

2674
03:54:40,647 --> 03:54:50,242
[SPEAKER_17]: And part of the CPI that they did wasn't also just for adults, it was for our children also, which I thank them, Sean, for his, was he still there?

2675
03:54:53,370 --> 03:54:56,252
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll say, like I say, over the years, they've probably done that a dozen times.

2676
03:54:56,693 --> 03:54:58,494
[SPEAKER_17]: And just a little story I want to share.

2677
03:54:59,915 --> 03:55:07,060
[SPEAKER_17]: One of the members that were trained through our organization actually saved the life of a person on the train coming home from work one day.

2678
03:55:07,500 --> 03:55:10,822
[SPEAKER_17]: So you say, well, it's only one life.

2679
03:55:10,862 --> 03:55:14,024
[SPEAKER_17]: But one life is a life that was saved because of their work.

2680
03:55:14,545 --> 03:55:16,026
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm going to be brief.

2681
03:55:16,046 --> 03:55:21,029
[SPEAKER_17]: But in conclusion, I hope that we're not making decisions

2682
03:55:23,206 --> 03:55:29,448
[SPEAKER_17]: the safety of our patients being transported by ambulance over paperwork snafus and hearsay.

2683
03:55:29,828 --> 03:55:37,630
[SPEAKER_17]: So I wanted to say Armstrong has provided 25 years of great service and I think they should continue.

2684
03:55:37,750 --> 03:55:38,450
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2685
03:55:39,550 --> 03:55:39,950
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2686
03:55:44,918 --> 03:55:47,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing no hands on Zoom, we'll stay at the podium.

2687
03:55:47,983 --> 03:55:49,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Name and address for the record, please.

2688
03:55:49,385 --> 03:55:50,086
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll have three minutes.

2689
03:55:50,426 --> 03:55:50,586
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.

2690
03:55:50,787 --> 03:55:51,668
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Tom Henderson.

2691
03:55:51,688 --> 03:55:54,612
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm the director of EMS for the Professional Firefighters of Massachusetts.

2692
03:55:54,692 --> 03:56:00,961
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm here representing the Medford Firefighters and the Teamsters Local 25 to support them in their endeavor here tonight.

2693
03:56:01,702 --> 03:56:03,003
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a little bit of background.

2694
03:56:03,023 --> 03:56:07,127
[SPEAKER_08]: I represent the PFM, 13,000 members statewide.

2695
03:56:07,187 --> 03:56:08,788
[SPEAKER_08]: I also sit on some national committees.

2696
03:56:09,489 --> 03:56:14,573
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think when you come to this decision tonight, first of all, Armstrong, I'm not a representative of Armstrong.

2697
03:56:14,813 --> 03:56:15,854
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't work for Armstrong.

2698
03:56:16,535 --> 03:56:17,676
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't work for the other companies.

2699
03:56:18,076 --> 03:56:24,702
[SPEAKER_08]: I work with all the companies statewide, and I understand their unique and their challenges and what they face in each community in Massachusetts.

2700
03:56:25,202 --> 03:56:27,263
[SPEAKER_08]: But this is a decision tonight that has me concerned.

2701
03:56:27,303 --> 03:56:29,144
[SPEAKER_08]: Coming up here tonight, I didn't know what to expect.

2702
03:56:29,204 --> 03:56:32,066
[SPEAKER_08]: And listening to the dialogue tonight, I have a lot of concerns.

2703
03:56:32,626 --> 03:56:36,528
[SPEAKER_08]: But most of all, first, we should talk about a little bit of history in the EMS.

2704
03:56:36,888 --> 03:56:38,229
[SPEAKER_08]: EMS has changed since COVID.

2705
03:56:38,549 --> 03:56:40,951
[SPEAKER_08]: We've had a lot of challenges, staffing issues.

2706
03:56:41,211 --> 03:56:46,273
[SPEAKER_08]: And a lot of these things are not just germane to the Armstrong industry in Medford.

2707
03:56:46,333 --> 03:56:46,994
[SPEAKER_08]: It's statewide.

2708
03:56:47,034 --> 03:56:47,734
[SPEAKER_08]: It's nationally.

2709
03:56:47,934 --> 03:56:51,576
[SPEAKER_08]: We've tried to help to deal with this with our education process, hiring processes.

2710
03:56:51,877 --> 03:56:52,557
[SPEAKER_08]: And we've done that.

2711
03:56:52,877 --> 03:56:53,918
[SPEAKER_08]: And we've come around from that.

2712
03:56:54,279 --> 03:56:59,606
[SPEAKER_08]: But we face challenges now in health care, where our ambulances are sitting at a hospital for well over an hour.

2713
03:56:59,806 --> 03:57:06,654
[SPEAKER_08]: It's called door times, or hold times, or wall times, to the point where in California they passed legislation to try to curb this.

2714
03:57:07,035 --> 03:57:08,497
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're facing that in Massachusetts.

2715
03:57:08,777 --> 03:57:11,280
[SPEAKER_08]: Yesterday, the ambulance company, well, the fire department I work for,

2716
03:57:12,547 --> 03:57:17,354
[SPEAKER_08]: We were sitting on a wall for over an hour waiting to transfer a patient.

2717
03:57:17,514 --> 03:57:20,478
[SPEAKER_08]: That impacted our local community for over an hour not having an ambulance.

2718
03:57:20,779 --> 03:57:22,101
[SPEAKER_08]: These are the changes that have happened.

2719
03:57:22,381 --> 03:57:24,905
[SPEAKER_08]: These are things you cannot put dollars and cents and values on.

2720
03:57:26,658 --> 03:57:30,982
[SPEAKER_08]: Next is, just listening to this transparent, I don't see that this was transparent at all.

2721
03:57:31,382 --> 03:57:37,687
[SPEAKER_08]: Changing vendors after 25 years, it's not like going from WB Mason to Staples for office supplies.

2722
03:57:37,788 --> 03:57:39,729
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the ambulance service for the city of Medford.

2723
03:57:39,849 --> 03:57:47,556
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it needs a much more deeper dive than just a couple meetings and some emails to determine one versus the other without a true RFP process.

2724
03:57:47,816 --> 03:57:57,842
[SPEAKER_08]: I understand it is exempt from an RFP process under Mass General Law, but I think when it comes to a service like this to the community, it needs to be well thought out and well done.

2725
03:57:58,754 --> 03:58:01,255
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't think it's been well done in this process so far.

2726
03:58:01,595 --> 03:58:09,056
[SPEAKER_08]: The experience and knowledge of these paramedics and EMTs in this city, it comes down to very simply, they go to people's houses that they've known, they've treated for years.

2727
03:58:09,417 --> 03:58:18,739
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, another thing that you cannot put a value on, the administration here, they understand how the service works and how to pivot it in times of need when you have 40 and 50 calls in a city like this.

2728
03:58:19,299 --> 03:58:21,840
[SPEAKER_08]: This is things that you're going to have to challenge moving forward.

2729
03:58:22,980 --> 03:58:23,320
[SPEAKER_08]: In the end,

2730
03:58:24,404 --> 03:58:27,826
[SPEAKER_08]: We hope that this is not a retaliation for unionization.

2731
03:58:28,206 --> 03:58:32,988
[SPEAKER_08]: We obviously know that the relationship between the union firefighters and the city have not been so great over the past years.

2732
03:58:33,268 --> 03:58:39,111
[SPEAKER_08]: And now to see this change, and now it speaks volumes to what has happened, them unionizing, okay?

2733
03:58:39,651 --> 03:58:40,492
[SPEAKER_08]: This is great because

2734
03:58:41,292 --> 03:58:44,576
[SPEAKER_08]: Armstrong Ambulance has come in and they've accepted it.

2735
03:58:44,616 --> 03:58:46,698
[SPEAKER_08]: They've worked a labor management relationship.

2736
03:58:47,018 --> 03:58:48,921
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, it speaks volumes that they can work this out.

2737
03:58:48,961 --> 03:58:51,283
[SPEAKER_08]: It hasn't come to a press or an issue.

2738
03:58:51,563 --> 03:58:56,129
[SPEAKER_08]: They've been able to take care of the service to the city of Medford, no matter what.

2739
03:58:56,429 --> 03:58:58,451
[SPEAKER_08]: And they've worked well together with the teams of Local 25.

2740
03:59:00,912 --> 03:59:01,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2741
03:59:01,452 --> 03:59:02,092
[SPEAKER_05]: If you could wrap up.

2742
03:59:02,553 --> 03:59:03,833
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just going to wrap up last thing.

2743
03:59:03,873 --> 03:59:05,814
[SPEAKER_08]: So I hope you could pause this transition.

2744
03:59:06,494 --> 03:59:14,497
[SPEAKER_08]: Council Scarpelli, I think they were waking the lion in you to, to realize that moving forward, if they can't stop this with Armstrong and it would be nice if you could keep Armstrong.

2745
03:59:15,277 --> 03:59:18,939
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully you could keep and hold the ambulance company accountable moving forward.

2746
03:59:19,359 --> 03:59:20,099
[SPEAKER_08]: That's most of all.

2747
03:59:20,339 --> 03:59:25,101
[SPEAKER_08]: And I hope the city handles all the contracts like they want to hold the high standard to that they speak about tonight.

2748
03:59:25,161 --> 03:59:26,462
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for your time and have a good night.

2749
03:59:26,482 --> 03:59:27,262
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2750
03:59:35,840 --> 03:59:39,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there anyone else who'd like to speak on this matter at this time?

2751
03:59:41,746 --> 03:59:42,026
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

2752
03:59:43,968 --> 03:59:45,069
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to time you this time.

2753
03:59:45,129 --> 03:59:45,769
[SPEAKER_20]: I know it's late.

2754
03:59:45,789 --> 03:59:46,410
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm really sorry.

2755
03:59:46,430 --> 03:59:47,150
[SPEAKER_20]: I apologize.

2756
03:59:47,190 --> 03:59:50,253
[SPEAKER_20]: But Tom Henderson made me think of something.

2757
03:59:50,793 --> 03:59:51,754
[SPEAKER_20]: Back to the contract.

2758
03:59:51,934 --> 03:59:58,861
[SPEAKER_20]: If you read the contract for Armstrong, it calls for one ALS, two BLS, and then a part-time truck.

2759
03:59:59,818 --> 04:00:09,440
[SPEAKER_20]: And 20, and this is what made me think of it when you said COVID, back in, when we signed this contract in 2022, it was also right around the time LMH was closing, just after LMH.

2760
04:00:10,260 --> 04:00:15,201
[SPEAKER_20]: And to Tom Henderson's point, more of the patients were now being transported to Boston.

2761
04:00:16,221 --> 04:00:22,602
[SPEAKER_20]: So when the vehicles will usually go into LMH and they could stay in the city and service and cover.

2762
04:00:23,362 --> 04:00:28,403
[SPEAKER_20]: Once they started to go to Mass General, in the wall time at Mass General, holding a,

2763
04:00:30,143 --> 04:00:42,013
[SPEAKER_20]: A transport for care started to turn from 15, 20 minutes to an hour to 90 minutes, dependent upon traffic to get to the Mass General, get back from the Mass General, clean the stretchers.

2764
04:00:42,494 --> 04:00:47,378
[SPEAKER_20]: So time went much higher, which left the city at risk of less ambulances.

2765
04:00:47,878 --> 04:00:49,660
[SPEAKER_20]: So, of course, we always had to keep pivoting.

2766
04:00:50,300 --> 04:00:52,862
[SPEAKER_20]: And we didn't actually even change the language.

2767
04:00:52,922 --> 04:00:53,483
[SPEAKER_20]: We went from

2768
04:00:54,307 --> 04:00:59,369
[SPEAKER_20]: One BLS truck, I'm sorry, yeah, one ALS truck to two BLS trucks.

2769
04:00:59,429 --> 04:01:04,071
[SPEAKER_20]: We just changed it for the betterment of the city to put in two ALS trucks and one BLS truck.

2770
04:01:04,111 --> 04:01:07,453
[SPEAKER_20]: So there was no, oh my God, we have to do this.

2771
04:01:07,893 --> 04:01:11,435
[SPEAKER_20]: We did great things, and again, we didn't look for a thank you.

2772
04:01:11,475 --> 04:01:17,117
[SPEAKER_20]: We just did it because it was the right thing to do related to the changes in the city because of the closure of the hospital.

2773
04:01:17,577 --> 04:01:19,218
[SPEAKER_20]: So I just thought that was important to say.

2774
04:01:19,318 --> 04:01:20,239
[SPEAKER_20]: So I thank you for your time.

2775
04:01:26,063 --> 04:01:27,143
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, you can come to the podium.

2776
04:01:27,903 --> 04:01:30,404
[SPEAKER_05]: And if there's anyone on Zoom who'd like to speak, you can raise your hand on Zoom.

2777
04:01:34,025 --> 04:01:36,285
[SPEAKER_16]: Just if you give your name and address for the record, and you'll have three minutes.

2778
04:01:36,525 --> 04:01:39,686
[SPEAKER_16]: Tyler Farley, 25 Morrissey Boulevard in Boston.

2779
04:01:41,347 --> 04:01:44,967
[SPEAKER_16]: I lived in Medford for years.

2780
04:01:45,208 --> 04:01:46,648
[SPEAKER_16]: I worked on the Medford ambulance.

2781
04:01:47,608 --> 04:01:50,289
[SPEAKER_16]: One thing I will say that's very different than the competitor,

2782
04:01:52,215 --> 04:01:53,976
[SPEAKER_16]: we do not shut down trucks.

2783
04:01:55,016 --> 04:02:01,037
[SPEAKER_16]: Armstrong will not shut down any truck to alleviate a staffing issue.

2784
04:02:01,558 --> 04:02:04,898
[SPEAKER_16]: So what I mean by that is the competitor, 7 a.m.

2785
04:02:04,918 --> 04:02:09,280
[SPEAKER_16]: hits, your shift's over, they will leave, the truck may be shut down.

2786
04:02:10,020 --> 04:02:11,460
[SPEAKER_16]: That would never happen at Armstrong.

2787
04:02:12,060 --> 04:02:17,662
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think that's one of the reasons why we all collectively like it so much, we know that

2788
04:02:19,868 --> 04:02:21,569
[SPEAKER_16]: The city is protected.

2789
04:02:24,830 --> 04:02:30,192
[SPEAKER_16]: The biggest thing about being a unionized company is we have good benefits.

2790
04:02:30,672 --> 04:02:39,675
[SPEAKER_16]: We could all leave, we could go to Cataldo, but it doesn't look like that's happening, and we wouldn't because of the union.

2791
04:02:39,795 --> 04:02:41,456
[SPEAKER_16]: We really, yeah.

2792
04:02:48,512 --> 04:02:50,833
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you.

2793
04:02:52,554 --> 04:02:54,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Not always easy to get up here, but we got your message.

2794
04:02:57,096 --> 04:02:57,436
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2795
04:02:58,417 --> 04:03:01,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyone else who wants to speak in this public comment period?

2796
04:03:02,579 --> 04:03:02,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on up.

2797
04:03:06,381 --> 04:03:08,242
[SPEAKER_05]: If you just give your name and address, you have three minutes.

2798
04:03:09,113 --> 04:03:10,554
[SPEAKER_15]: My name is Eliza Casam.

2799
04:03:10,694 --> 04:03:14,775
[SPEAKER_15]: I live at 8 Sorrel Place in Burlington, and I'm a paramedic with Armstrong Ambulance.

2800
04:03:15,215 --> 04:03:16,516
[SPEAKER_15]: I've worked here for four years.

2801
04:03:17,036 --> 04:03:22,538
[SPEAKER_15]: I wanted to take this opportunity to thank all of my colleagues for coming out tonight and the week before.

2802
04:03:23,198 --> 04:03:32,782
[SPEAKER_15]: I think you can have people with the same certifications, you can have the same ambulance, but what really truly makes a difference is my colleagues and the dedication that they put into this city.

2803
04:03:34,363 --> 04:03:40,307
[SPEAKER_15]: So not to put too fine a point on it, but I just wanted to say that it's been an honor to serve you.

2804
04:03:40,347 --> 04:03:42,029
[SPEAKER_15]: It's been an honor to work with all of you.

2805
04:03:42,049 --> 04:03:47,032
[SPEAKER_15]: And when you lose this contract, unfortunately, you are losing us.

2806
04:03:47,833 --> 04:03:48,153
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2807
04:03:48,173 --> 04:03:49,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2808
04:03:49,134 --> 04:03:57,660
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2809
04:03:57,700 --> 04:04:02,064
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's no further public comment, I'm going to close public comment at this time.

2810
04:04:03,602 --> 04:04:04,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you all.

2811
04:04:05,103 --> 04:04:07,984
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll go to Councilor Scarpelli.

2812
04:04:08,004 --> 04:04:10,465
[SPEAKER_09]: I do have one from Ron Givino.

2813
04:04:10,825 --> 04:04:11,425
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

2814
04:04:11,625 --> 04:04:16,387
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately, he says, Councilor Scarpelli, I apologize for not being able to stay at the meeting.

2815
04:04:16,467 --> 04:04:23,490
[SPEAKER_09]: I would like to ask you to read this email to the record with regards to community impact made over the years by Armstrong Ambulance.

2816
04:04:23,910 --> 04:04:24,811
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Ron Givino.

2817
04:04:24,831 --> 04:04:27,412
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm the president and co-founder of Method Invitational Tournament, Inc.

2818
04:04:27,892 --> 04:04:30,993
[SPEAKER_09]: We're a 501C3 based here in Medford.

2819
04:04:31,393 --> 04:04:35,354
[SPEAKER_09]: This year, the MIT is celebrating its 30th year of service to the Medford community.

2820
04:04:35,434 --> 04:04:42,657
[SPEAKER_09]: From our humble beginnings in 96, our organization has dedicated itself to playing sports and Medford, a celebration for our youth.

2821
04:04:43,137 --> 04:04:49,179
[SPEAKER_09]: Approximately 20 years ago, the direction of MIT turned to focusing on children in Medford with mental and physical challenges.

2822
04:04:49,739 --> 04:04:53,800
[SPEAKER_09]: The reason for our success, reputation in Medford, has been created through the assistance

2823
04:04:54,657 --> 04:05:08,993
[SPEAKER_09]: of our local and state government, the many great volunteers, amazing challenger families, and the local businesses, communities, which include organizations like the Teamsters Local 25, Avellino's Restaurant, National Grid, Medford Family Network, and so many more.

2824
04:05:09,554 --> 04:05:16,201
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm writing to tell you about the men and women of Armstrong Ambulance and how they became a proud partner of the MIT more than 20 years ago.

2825
04:05:16,798 --> 04:05:19,240
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been listening all night to the discussion.

2826
04:05:19,300 --> 04:05:24,763
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm compelled to mention what a fantastic neighbor Armstrong has been to our children.

2827
04:05:24,783 --> 04:05:31,187
[SPEAKER_09]: In 2006, when MIT first established a Challenge a Day baseball tournament, we were in need of medical coverage at the events.

2828
04:05:31,668 --> 04:05:35,170
[SPEAKER_09]: From my first call to Armstrong, they agreed to send the ambulance to the event.

2829
04:05:35,530 --> 04:05:40,013
[SPEAKER_09]: The Armstrong staff was there for emergencies and care for some overheated children.

2830
04:05:40,073 --> 04:05:46,317
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to talk tonight not about the professionalism, but the amazing spirit and energy Armstrong team brought to the event.

2831
04:05:46,927 --> 04:05:51,815
[SPEAKER_09]: The team opened the ambulance and showed our kids what it can do to engage the children.

2832
04:05:52,175 --> 04:05:57,663
[SPEAKER_09]: They stayed beyond the end of the event and helped us serve lunch and they always want to do more.

2833
04:05:57,984 --> 04:06:00,428
[SPEAKER_09]: They ended each event thanking us for the invitation.

2834
04:06:01,135 --> 04:06:03,678
[SPEAKER_09]: This great spirit continued each year in the event.

2835
04:06:03,838 --> 04:06:11,226
[SPEAKER_09]: Each year, whatever different personnel showed at the event, they all took pride in the event and their role helping children smile.

2836
04:06:11,726 --> 04:06:15,490
[SPEAKER_09]: Each employee was respectful and shared the pride they had in their job.

2837
04:06:15,550 --> 04:06:20,996
[SPEAKER_09]: In addition, Armstrong always supported us financially, making donations and helping us raise money

2838
04:06:21,556 --> 04:06:22,797
[SPEAKER_09]: at our fundraising event.

2839
04:06:23,177 --> 04:06:33,044
[SPEAKER_09]: With all the talk tonight about this contract, I'm one Medford resident who felt the need to rise and express my disappointment in how this seemed to be handled.

2840
04:06:33,485 --> 04:06:43,471
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish and thank Armstrong Ambulance for generosity and for being a great corporate partner of the Medford Invitational Tournament, Ron Giovino, President and CEO, Medford Invitational Tournament.

2841
04:06:44,532 --> 04:06:45,413
[SPEAKER_09]: So that was from Ron.

2842
04:06:47,454 --> 04:06:59,722
[SPEAKER_09]: If I can, Mr. President, something that the Armstrong people didn't say or didn't share with us, and I'd like to share the things that you don't know what Armstrong does in 2025.

2843
04:07:00,723 --> 04:07:05,126
[SPEAKER_09]: Armstrong on their own supported the method business trick or treat event.

2844
04:07:05,845 --> 04:07:27,694
[SPEAKER_09]: The Medford Overcoming Addiction Kickball Tournament, The Medford Oktoberfest, The Run for Medford 2-Day Road Race Coverage, McGlynn Middle School Medford Donation, City of Medford Kids Fishing Day, Hoops for Hope Medford, City of Medford National Night Out, Medford Junior Police Academy, Medford High School Special Olympics, Medford High School Graduation, City of Medford Flag Raising Ceremony,

2845
04:07:28,154 --> 04:07:40,778
[SPEAKER_09]: Medford Fair and fundraising people with disabilities, City of Medford community inclusion, Medford High School sporting events, Medford High School varsity football season for 2025, all for zero.

2846
04:07:40,998 --> 04:07:42,018
[SPEAKER_09]: Didn't ask for a penny.

2847
04:07:42,419 --> 04:07:44,159
[SPEAKER_09]: That was over $20,000 in care that nobody knows about.

2848
04:07:52,369 --> 04:07:55,931
[SPEAKER_09]: I just hope when you think of contracts, we look at that process.

2849
04:07:55,971 --> 04:08:14,018
[SPEAKER_09]: But in closing, Mr. President, if I can, I got a little emotional because the young lady that came up at the end, you remind me of the young lady that came to my mom.

2850
04:08:14,819 --> 04:08:19,020
[SPEAKER_09]: And one thing she loved was she would always kiss her on the forehead.

2851
04:08:22,827 --> 04:08:24,088
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what people don't see.

2852
04:08:26,610 --> 04:08:43,224
[SPEAKER_09]: So I apologize for being emotional, but for those people that know me and my family the way we had a fight for my mom, having a partner from Armstrong just for those three days, bringing her back and forth from dialysis when she was a puddle, I want to thank you.

2853
04:08:43,364 --> 04:08:46,787
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is why I brought this forward because

2854
04:08:47,836 --> 04:08:57,401
[SPEAKER_09]: There are people right now taking their mothers and fathers to dialysis, and there are people like yourselves that are making sure that they're smiling at the most miserable time of their lives.

2855
04:08:57,541 --> 04:08:58,481
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you so much.

2856
04:09:05,745 --> 04:09:10,887
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli, and I'm usually the only one who cries at these meetings, so thanks for taking that.

2857
04:09:13,889 --> 04:09:15,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'll own that one myself.

2858
04:09:17,264 --> 04:09:22,948
[SPEAKER_05]: I did, I think, capture a motion from Councilor Scarpelli and then some requests for information.

2859
04:09:22,968 --> 04:09:28,771
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll read those back and then I can send them to the clerk and I have them in writing.

2860
04:09:30,052 --> 04:09:30,532
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll help.

2861
04:09:31,693 --> 04:09:49,348
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think I had a motion from Councilor Scarpelli to request that the mayor pause the transition of EMS services to Cataldo slated for Caldo Ambulance slated for January 19, 2026 and delay until such time that a transition plan is published and shared with residents and the administration provides the information requested by the City Council.

2862
04:09:51,230 --> 04:09:52,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli?

2863
04:09:52,711 --> 04:09:53,172
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, great.

2864
04:09:54,393 --> 04:09:55,594
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a second on that motion?

2865
04:09:59,120 --> 04:10:00,341
[SPEAKER_05]: seconded by Councilor Leming.

2866
04:10:01,422 --> 04:10:05,206
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I'll just read the other two and we can take a vote on them all at the same time.

2867
04:10:05,226 --> 04:10:07,989
[SPEAKER_05]: And someone can make this one.

2868
04:10:08,009 --> 04:10:11,373
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a motion to request the following information from the city administration.

2869
04:10:12,352 --> 04:10:40,035
[SPEAKER_05]: One, a copy of the new contract with Cataldo Ambulance, city data on EMS response times, going back 10 years if possible, and including the average response time and responses, you know, proportion of responses over 10 minutes, transition plan for how Medford will be covered for EMS services after January 19th, and any reports from Cataldo about their coverage plans.

2870
04:10:43,628 --> 04:10:50,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Year-over-year comparison of Armstrong response times and Cataldo response times over the life of the contract.

2871
04:10:51,437 --> 04:10:58,645
[SPEAKER_05]: Assuming it moves forward, year-over-year comparison of Armstrong requests for mutual aid and Cataldo requests for mutual aid over the life of the contract.

2872
04:10:59,290 --> 04:11:28,163
[SPEAKER_05]: and then information on the Armstrong payments in the 2022 contract, including written options or written opinions or advice of legal counsel regarding Armstrong contact payments when invoices were submitted by the city to Armstrong since 2020 and documentation to prove the expenses or communications to commit to produce documentation before invoicing Armstrong for payment.

2873
04:11:29,875 --> 04:11:31,837
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there anything else folks would like to add on that?

2874
04:11:32,397 --> 04:11:34,099
[SPEAKER_05]: That's for the city councilor Scarpelli.

2875
04:11:35,440 --> 04:11:44,448
[SPEAKER_09]: The housing plan to see what kind of impact that's going to make, not only for our firefighters, but also our residents.

2876
04:11:45,562 --> 04:12:02,346
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't, I can't see having a functioning ambulance in a bay that's going to be called out at 2, 3, 4 o'clock in the morning and firefighters that just came back from a fire and making sure that they can get a healthy night's sleep if that's the case, Mr. President.

2877
04:12:02,386 --> 04:12:09,087
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think understanding the housing of Cataldo Ambulance is going to be very important to understand this process.

2878
04:12:09,107 --> 04:12:09,407
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

2879
04:12:09,547 --> 04:12:13,488
[SPEAKER_05]: I added up the plan from the city and Cataldo for how they will house ambulances in Medford.

2880
04:12:13,728 --> 04:12:14,008
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

2881
04:12:15,670 --> 04:12:18,511
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other requests for information from the administration that we want to add?

2882
04:12:22,493 --> 04:12:22,773
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2883
04:12:23,273 --> 04:12:33,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a motion to request that information on the motion of Councilor Leming seconded by seconded by Councilor Malayne.

2884
04:12:38,920 --> 04:12:40,661
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the last one is we did have.

2885
04:12:41,724 --> 04:12:46,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Armstrong Ambulance, so we can submit this to you guys directly through our clerk.

2886
04:12:46,808 --> 04:12:50,391
[SPEAKER_05]: But we did have a request for a few things.

2887
04:12:50,471 --> 04:12:54,154
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a motion to request the following information from Armstrong Ambulance.

2888
04:12:55,796 --> 04:13:02,021
[SPEAKER_05]: One, the email from the city to Armstrong demanding $450,000 payable within 10 days.

2889
04:13:03,362 --> 04:13:10,768
[SPEAKER_05]: The email from City Legal Counsel to Armstrong saying that they were concerned with the legality of the payments.

2890
04:13:11,948 --> 04:13:21,013
[SPEAKER_05]: The email from the mayor to Armstrong saying that the city was going in a different direction and any formal letter from the city to close out the contract with Armstrong.

2891
04:13:22,643 --> 04:13:31,389
[SPEAKER_05]: And then as well, I know you already said you could get it to us, but the data on your response times, going back 10 years is great.

2892
04:13:32,029 --> 04:13:36,913
[SPEAKER_05]: Average response time, and if possible, it'd be great to see like the proportion of responses that were over 10 minutes.

2893
04:13:37,533 --> 04:13:40,295
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that may be tough, but if you could, it's not tough, great.

2894
04:13:41,576 --> 04:13:42,116
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be great.

2895
04:13:43,637 --> 04:13:46,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a motion for that information?

2896
04:13:49,781 --> 04:13:50,122
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2897
04:13:50,182 --> 04:13:52,023
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by?

2898
04:13:54,733 --> 04:13:55,874
[SPEAKER_05]: by Councilor Mullane.

2899
04:14:01,657 --> 04:14:02,597
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2900
04:14:09,101 --> 04:14:10,002
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Callahan?

2901
04:14:10,562 --> 04:14:10,762
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

2902
04:14:12,683 --> 04:14:13,844
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Lazzaro?

2903
04:14:14,524 --> 04:14:14,764
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

2904
04:14:16,305 --> 04:14:16,966
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Leming?

2905
04:14:16,986 --> 04:14:17,046
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

2906
04:14:18,426 --> 04:14:19,047
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Mullane?

2907
04:14:19,067 --> 04:14:19,127
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

2908
04:14:20,388 --> 04:14:21,168
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Scarpelli?

2909
04:14:21,188 --> 04:14:21,288
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

2910
04:14:22,629 --> 04:14:23,369
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Tseng?

2911
04:14:23,689 --> 04:14:23,870
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

2912
04:14:25,162 --> 04:14:25,742
[SPEAKER_10]: President Bears.

2913
04:14:25,803 --> 04:14:28,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I'm the affirmative, none of the negative, the motion passes.

2914
04:14:28,425 --> 04:14:42,316
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we will try to get that information and we have requested that the mayor delay this transition until that information is provided and until there's been a publication of the transition plan.

2915
04:14:45,959 --> 04:14:46,539
[SPEAKER_05]: We got one more.

2916
04:14:53,105 --> 04:14:55,906
[SPEAKER_05]: 25149 resolution to establish our recruitment and hiring process for the City Clerk.

2917
04:14:56,567 --> 04:14:58,068
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have an update on that.

2918
04:14:58,828 --> 04:15:06,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Recognize Councilor Callahan or Councilor Vice President Lazzaro, whoever would like to go.

2919
04:15:06,032 --> 04:15:11,575
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm seeing Vice President Lazzaro, so I'll recognize you first.

2920
04:15:12,876 --> 04:15:13,256
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

2921
04:15:17,235 --> 04:15:24,823
[SPEAKER_19]: Hiring of the city clerk is the position that the city council can oversee.

2922
04:15:25,404 --> 04:15:26,985
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry, I'm not feeling very well.

2923
04:15:27,946 --> 04:15:28,827
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's quite late.

2924
04:15:29,168 --> 04:15:36,816
[SPEAKER_19]: And so we've been trying to take this process very seriously and be very thoughtful and thorough about it.

2925
04:15:37,524 --> 04:15:50,973
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, we were having a difficult time reviewing all of the resumes, uh, and, and we felt it was important that we, uh, have a full, uh, the full access to every resume that was submitted.

2926
04:15:51,734 --> 04:15:59,739
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, and in our conversations with the human resources department, um, it, you know, over the holidays, things were delayed.

2927
04:16:00,360 --> 04:16:05,183
[SPEAKER_19]: So, uh, my proposal is that we, um,

2928
04:16:05,696 --> 04:16:34,030
[SPEAKER_19]: interview from the pool of applicants from before the holidays, um, from our smaller subset of the city council, which is me, councilor Callahan and president Bears, um, uh, that we choose from, from that pool, the standout applicants, but then that we also, um, ask the human resources department where, uh, the, the, um,

2929
04:16:34,658 --> 04:17:04,350
[SPEAKER_19]: posting was listed and repost the listing again, um, without a minimum requirement so that we can see, um, if we, uh, into, uh, perhaps a wider, um, uh, posting range, uh, just of locations were proposed, uh, so that we can, um, pull in fresh resumes since we had to end up waiting kind of a long time and that the, um,

2930
04:17:05,157 --> 04:17:10,118
[SPEAKER_19]: resumes that we have, a lot of those people may have gotten jobs by now.

2931
04:17:10,138 --> 04:17:32,265
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's my proposal that we request interviews from the people that look really good from the group of resumes that we have now, and that we attempt to repost in addition to a little bit of a wider pool and just to get a fresher group of resumes because it's been so long.

2932
04:17:33,345 --> 04:17:33,605
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

2933
04:17:34,897 --> 04:17:36,383
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll second that.

2934
04:17:37,467 --> 04:17:38,612
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm seconding the motion.

2935
04:17:41,159 --> 04:17:53,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Great, so we have a motion from Vice President Lazzaro to repost the city clerk job posting without the minimum requirements so that we can bring in some new resumes.

2936
04:17:53,322 --> 04:18:01,384
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we can schedule interviews both from that group, the resumes we've received so far, any resumes we receive with the reposting.

2937
04:18:02,204 --> 04:18:06,605
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we can schedule interviews from either of those groups.

2938
04:18:07,825 --> 04:18:09,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lazzaro, I do have one question.

2939
04:18:12,127 --> 04:18:22,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Long did we want to post repost the job posting without the minimum requirements for Um, I would say.

2940
04:18:23,101 --> 04:18:25,503
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, I am open to discussion on that.

2941
04:18:26,624 --> 04:18:35,090
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not sure, but I don't think I would want to keep it posted for very long just because it's taken us this long to work this process so far.

2942
04:18:35,110 --> 04:18:38,613
[SPEAKER_19]: I would really like to get this wrapped up as soon as possible, personally.

2943
04:18:38,633 --> 04:18:45,037
[SPEAKER_19]: So maybe only a few weeks I would want to post it, just so we can try to accelerate the process from here.

2944
04:18:46,598 --> 04:18:46,819
[SPEAKER_05]: Got it.

2945
04:18:46,899 --> 04:18:47,959
[SPEAKER_05]: And you also mentioned that

2946
04:18:49,090 --> 04:18:52,333
[SPEAKER_05]: You wanted to post it in a few more places than it was posted.

2947
04:18:52,673 --> 04:18:53,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Were there any specifics on that?

2948
04:18:54,535 --> 04:18:57,558
[SPEAKER_19]: I would like to post I would like to make sure it's posted to MasterList.

2949
04:18:57,698 --> 04:19:01,822
[SPEAKER_19]: And there is another MasterList is a newsletter about politics.

2950
04:19:01,862 --> 04:19:11,511
[SPEAKER_19]: And there's another I cannot remember the name of the other one, but it's a similar general post.

2951
04:19:11,591 --> 04:19:15,034
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, something like it's a

2952
04:19:15,891 --> 04:19:28,463
[SPEAKER_19]: I wanted to talk to Lisa from human resources for the city to ask where they were posted before and make sure we're covering a few other locations.

2953
04:19:29,404 --> 04:19:30,005
[SPEAKER_19]: I can't remember.

2954
04:19:30,165 --> 04:19:32,988
[SPEAKER_19]: Actually, I'm going to just look through my notes if I can just have one second.

2955
04:19:33,268 --> 04:19:33,588
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry.

2956
04:19:35,490 --> 04:19:35,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Got it.

2957
04:19:35,890 --> 04:19:36,151
[SPEAKER_05]: That's OK.

2958
04:19:38,882 --> 04:19:48,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there any discussion members of the council on the length of time that the job should be posted if we're gonna be reposting it hopefully this week?

2959
04:19:50,104 --> 04:19:52,724
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Malay and then Councilor Leming.

2960
04:19:55,105 --> 04:20:01,106
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you to Vice President Lazzaro for bringing this up and Councilor Callahan.

2961
04:20:01,186 --> 04:20:08,487
[SPEAKER_21]: I would say, I don't know if going any longer than 60 days, especially since you already have had it out there for a little bit of time,

2962
04:20:09,142 --> 04:20:25,300
[SPEAKER_21]: I think if it's proactive, it sounds like you all have really tried to get this to a place where more people would have eyes on it and more ability to actually apply, given some of the changes, into the actual JDs.

2963
04:20:25,380 --> 04:20:30,385
[SPEAKER_21]: So I don't think you need to go, or I wouldn't think you need to go much more than the 60 days.

2964
04:20:33,527 --> 04:20:37,568
[SPEAKER_05]: Got it, I was definitely thinking a much shorter amount of time.

2965
04:20:37,928 --> 04:20:41,069
[SPEAKER_05]: I really would like us to get a new clerk, Councilor Leming.

2966
04:20:43,650 --> 04:20:46,571
[SPEAKER_11]: I propose 13 and a half days exactly.

2967
04:20:46,591 --> 04:20:51,252
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna lose my mind.

2968
04:20:52,212 --> 04:20:53,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilors Arlen, Councilor Callahan.

2969
04:20:55,242 --> 04:20:55,542
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

2970
04:20:55,682 --> 04:21:00,964
[SPEAKER_19]: I, uh, yeah, I was thinking like two to three weeks, like 20, 21 days would be like a max for me.

2971
04:21:01,224 --> 04:21:10,567
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, but the, the, the locations I was specifically thinking of were master list and MMA jobs board, um, as good locations to make sure that we posted that.

2972
04:21:10,607 --> 04:21:23,651
[SPEAKER_19]: But I think I would really like to just verify where it was posted before what common practices with the city job postings, and then to make sure that those two areas, just because I know when I'm looking for jobs that are, you know,

2973
04:21:24,270 --> 04:21:33,380
[SPEAKER_19]: something or people that are have similar backgrounds to somebody who we'd be looking for in the city clerk that that would be where somebody would be looking for a position like this.

2974
04:21:33,921 --> 04:21:36,824
[SPEAKER_19]: So, um, I think that's important to know.

2975
04:21:37,225 --> 04:21:37,525
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

2976
04:21:42,611 --> 04:21:43,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Callahan.

2977
04:21:45,903 --> 04:21:51,686
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I think once we actually get it up, then we should give people three weeks.

2978
04:21:52,347 --> 04:21:55,889
[SPEAKER_18]: So I would think maybe the 6th of February, which is a Friday.

2979
04:21:55,909 --> 04:21:59,391
[SPEAKER_05]: Got it.

2980
04:21:59,431 --> 04:22:01,212
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be about two, three weeks.

2981
04:22:02,212 --> 04:22:04,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that good with everybody?

2982
04:22:07,195 --> 04:22:08,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Seems like generally yes.

2983
04:22:09,136 --> 04:22:10,017
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2984
04:22:13,839 --> 04:22:14,619
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have...

2985
04:22:17,308 --> 04:22:34,640
[SPEAKER_05]: hear a motion by Councilor Lazzaro for to repost the city clerk job posting without the minimum requirements through Friday, February 6th, 2026 to request to post the job on master list and mass municipal association job board.

2986
04:22:35,140 --> 04:22:37,962
[SPEAKER_05]: In addition to the standard HR department platforms.

2987
04:22:38,486 --> 04:22:52,234
[SPEAKER_05]: and for the special subcommittee of President Bears, Vice President Lazzaro, and Councilor Callahan to schedule interviews from both the pool of resumes already received and any resumes received during this additional posting.

2988
04:22:52,254 --> 04:22:53,215
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that sound about right?

2989
04:22:53,235 --> 04:22:56,257
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that sounds great.

2990
04:22:57,697 --> 04:22:57,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

2991
04:23:03,801 --> 04:23:06,603
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have any further discussion by members of the council on that motion?

2992
04:23:08,037 --> 04:23:09,858
[SPEAKER_05]: It's seconded by Councilor Callahan.

2993
04:23:14,602 --> 04:23:19,645
[SPEAKER_05]: I do note we do have HR Director Crowley and we do have the Chief of Staff still here.

2994
04:23:23,368 --> 04:23:24,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you guys have any comments on this?

2995
04:23:24,809 --> 04:23:27,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this something, I mean, something we wanna do?

2996
04:23:28,011 --> 04:23:31,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Just any questions or any suggestions?

2997
04:23:39,623 --> 04:23:41,945
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not seeing any from the Chief of Staff.

2998
04:23:44,888 --> 04:23:46,910
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to raise your hand, Director Crowley.

2999
04:23:46,930 --> 04:24:01,563
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, not seeing any, not seeing any further discussion on the motion of Councilor Lazzaro, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

3000
04:24:01,583 --> 04:24:03,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

3001
04:24:07,755 --> 04:24:08,676
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Callahan?

3002
04:24:09,116 --> 04:24:09,396
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

3003
04:24:11,177 --> 04:24:12,318
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Lazzaro?

3004
04:24:12,819 --> 04:24:13,079
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

3005
04:24:14,660 --> 04:24:15,280
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Leming?

3006
04:24:15,300 --> 04:24:15,380
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

3007
04:24:17,081 --> 04:24:17,762
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Mullain?

3008
04:24:17,782 --> 04:24:17,842
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

3009
04:24:19,143 --> 04:24:19,983
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Scarpelli?

3010
04:24:20,003 --> 04:24:20,084
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

3011
04:24:21,304 --> 04:24:22,065
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Tseng?

3012
04:24:22,425 --> 04:24:22,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

3013
04:24:24,126 --> 04:24:24,807
[SPEAKER_10]: President Bears?

3014
04:24:25,347 --> 04:24:25,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

3015
04:24:26,708 --> 04:24:28,469
[SPEAKER_05]: That's seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

3016
04:24:28,890 --> 04:24:31,051
[SPEAKER_05]: I do see Director Nwaje's hand.

3017
04:24:31,872 --> 04:24:36,315
[SPEAKER_05]: We did vote already, but I will recognize you for any comment.

3018
04:24:39,348 --> 04:24:41,089
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, hello, good evening, everybody.

3019
04:24:41,329 --> 04:24:45,571
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're already two weeks into the new year, but happy 2026.

3020
04:24:46,191 --> 04:25:03,779
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to share that I am listening and I do have to bring up the equity concerns around looking at current applicants and then looking at possible new applicants if you are removing the criteria.

3021
04:25:04,380 --> 04:25:07,501
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what that has done, it has eliminated

3022
04:25:08,247 --> 04:25:13,672
[SPEAKER_00]: over 100 plus current applicants, right?

3023
04:25:13,712 --> 04:25:20,879
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there would have been people who would have looked at the posting and said, oh, gee, I don't meet the minimum entrance requirements.

3024
04:25:21,980 --> 04:25:27,365
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to make sure that you're aware that we don't just post in one place.

3025
04:25:27,905 --> 04:25:32,790
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually use a portal, and that portal posts to over 100 job boards.

3026
04:25:34,528 --> 04:25:36,970
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also post on the MMA.

3027
04:25:37,891 --> 04:25:49,521
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not familiar with the other sites that Councilor Lazzaro had mentioned, but if somebody wants to shoot me an email so that I can look it up, that would be great.

3028
04:25:49,581 --> 04:25:51,022
[SPEAKER_00]: But those are my comments.

3029
04:25:54,024 --> 04:25:55,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Director Nwaje.

3030
04:25:55,085 --> 04:26:00,109
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

3031
04:26:00,910 --> 04:26:02,351
[SPEAKER_05]: I will forward this resolution along.

3032
04:26:05,447 --> 04:26:06,569
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the end of business tonight.

3033
04:26:08,471 --> 04:26:08,831
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

3034
04:26:09,992 --> 04:26:10,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Madam Chief of Staff.

3035
04:26:13,856 --> 04:26:18,221
[SPEAKER_14]: I received a message from HR Director Crowley that she's having a hard time with Zoom.

3036
04:26:18,481 --> 04:26:21,224
[SPEAKER_14]: Perhaps you could unmute her.

3037
04:26:21,264 --> 04:26:21,604
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

3038
04:26:24,327 --> 04:26:26,850
[SPEAKER_05]: You did vote on the resolution but Director Crowley.

3039
04:26:28,310 --> 04:26:29,471
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, sorry about that.

3040
04:26:29,531 --> 04:26:31,371
[SPEAKER_12]: Through you President Bez to the council.

3041
04:26:31,532 --> 04:26:35,573
[SPEAKER_12]: I just couldn't figure out how to raise my hand and my screen kept going blank.

3042
04:26:36,194 --> 04:26:38,875
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, I just want to confirm what Francis just said.

3043
04:26:39,355 --> 04:26:50,060
[SPEAKER_12]: We do post on over a hundred sites and MMA and for us to post without the mayors would be, um, against our process that we do now.

3044
04:26:50,940 --> 04:26:54,122
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, we're required to post the mayors plus, um,

3045
04:26:55,178 --> 04:27:03,430
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, the range for the position, so I'd be happy to talk to the committee that's going to be on the interview panels about that.

3046
04:27:04,191 --> 04:27:11,242
[SPEAKER_12]: But I just wanted to let, you know, that that's something that we wouldn't normally do because then we would have people who are unqualified.

3047
04:27:13,162 --> 04:27:19,967
[SPEAKER_12]: applying for positions and especially that the city clerk title is somewhat misleading sometimes.

3048
04:27:21,068 --> 04:27:33,897
[SPEAKER_12]: I did send the full gamut of resumes to President Bears and there was probably at least 80 names on there maybe 60 to 80 names and you'll see that a lot of them were

3049
04:27:35,630 --> 04:27:41,595
[SPEAKER_12]: not qualified because they did not understand what the actual position was.

3050
04:27:42,155 --> 04:27:51,203
[SPEAKER_12]: I think posting without the mayors may bring you more resumes for people that would not be qualified for this type of position.

3051
04:27:52,144 --> 04:27:52,444
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

3052
04:27:56,995 --> 04:28:01,758
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we're happy to, I think the three of us are happy to do the sorting through on that.

3053
04:28:01,798 --> 04:28:13,545
[SPEAKER_05]: We were just trying to, we think that the minimum requirements upon kind of the process that, you know, I don't think we realized that that would mean that we wouldn't receive all the resumes, you know, and that was an ongoing.

3054
04:28:13,565 --> 04:28:19,869
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we have received them now, but we wanted to make sure that we could consider everyone who applied.

3055
04:28:21,600 --> 04:28:23,942
[SPEAKER_05]: and, you know, make that determination ourselves.

3056
04:28:24,162 --> 04:28:29,647
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's another way for us to do that, I think, you know, we'd be open to that.

3057
04:28:29,747 --> 04:28:34,150
[SPEAKER_05]: But this seemed to just be the easiest way to address that issue.

3058
04:28:35,731 --> 04:28:48,722
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think to Director Nwaje's point, you know, we're really hoping to actually expand the pool and get more people applying, not restrict the pool.

3059
04:28:51,648 --> 04:28:54,289
[SPEAKER_05]: That was kind of our goal with this since we had an issue.

3060
04:28:54,309 --> 04:29:06,811
[SPEAKER_05]: We were people we wanted to kind of consider who because of the minimum requirements on the last posting, the HR department was reluctant to have us consider or provide the application until kind of in December.

3061
04:29:07,011 --> 04:29:11,052
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was just the reasoning in the back and forth that we had.

3062
04:29:12,072 --> 04:29:16,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a different way for us to go about that, Director Crowley, or are you comfortable if we

3063
04:29:17,451 --> 04:29:22,832
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, the three of us just take on the fact that we may get a bunch of applications from people who really aren't qualified.

3064
04:29:25,953 --> 04:29:29,034
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd like to probably just digest this a little because it is late.

3065
04:29:30,034 --> 04:29:36,056
[SPEAKER_12]: And then maybe we can talk offline so that I can figure out what plan of action is going to work best.

3066
04:29:37,176 --> 04:29:37,817
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, got it.

3067
04:29:38,457 --> 04:29:45,879
[SPEAKER_05]: I will forward this along after the meeting and we can continue to discuss by email or set up a meeting between the four of us.

3068
04:29:46,199 --> 04:29:46,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

3069
04:29:48,981 --> 04:29:49,181
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

3070
04:29:49,821 --> 04:29:51,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Any further discussion?

3071
04:29:51,482 --> 04:29:52,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.

3072
04:29:52,442 --> 04:29:53,662
[SPEAKER_05]: And thanks for staying at this late hour.

3073
04:29:54,682 --> 04:30:00,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Any further discussion on any matters before the council or any motions by the council?

3074
04:30:05,505 --> 04:30:06,205
[SPEAKER_05]: We can be done now.

3075
04:30:08,445 --> 04:30:09,986
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to adjourn.

3076
04:30:11,886 --> 04:30:14,647
