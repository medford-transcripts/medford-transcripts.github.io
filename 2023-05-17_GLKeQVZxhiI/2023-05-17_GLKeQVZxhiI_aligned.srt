00:00:44,497 --> 00:00:46,899
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:46,919 --> 00:00:46,999
It's 5.02.

3
00:00:47,259 --> 00:00:48,661
We'll get started in a moment.

4
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:52,664
Just want to make sure I don't see Sharon on here yet.

5
00:00:53,445 --> 00:00:54,085
Member Hayes.

6
00:00:55,547 --> 00:00:56,568
Give it another few minutes.

7
00:01:59,070 --> 00:01:59,851
Can everyone hear me.

8
00:02:02,013 --> 00:02:02,874
Hi, thank you.

9
00:02:03,495 --> 00:02:03,896
Yep.

10
00:02:03,956 --> 00:02:04,556
Okay, good.

11
00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:14,988
Welcome, everyone to the diversity, equity and inclusion subcommittee meeting for today.

12
00:02:19,877 --> 00:02:20,257
Thank you.

13
00:02:20,738 --> 00:02:21,559
Member Hayes, sorry.

14
00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:23,141
If you could mute, that would be great.

15
00:02:23,181 --> 00:02:23,541
Thank you.

16
00:02:25,303 --> 00:02:29,989
So it's, please, I'm just gonna read our notice and then we'll get started.

17
00:02:30,009 --> 00:02:39,280

18
00:02:40,113 --> 00:02:51,196
The purpose of the subcommittee meeting will be to examine the new safety procedures outlined in the update to the Medford High School student handbook sent to families on January 2nd, 2023, from a DEI perspective.

19
00:02:52,097 --> 00:02:58,559
The meeting can be viewed through Medford Community Media on Comcast Channel 15 and Verizon Channel 45 at 5 p.m.

00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:04,861
Since the meeting will be held remotely, participants can log or call in by using the following link or call-in number.

21
00:03:06,261 --> 00:03:08,802

And with that, we will take roll call.

24
00:03:33,992 --> 00:03:35,873
Have I been talking this whole time and I've been mute?

25
00:03:36,293 --> 00:03:36,713
Seriously?

26
00:03:37,014 --> 00:03:37,214
Oh, okay.

27
00:03:37,274 --> 00:03:37,974
I thought it was mute.

28
00:03:38,034 --> 00:03:38,574
Thank you guys.

29
00:03:38,614 --> 00:03:38,795
Good.

30
00:03:39,455 --> 00:03:40,315
So member Hayes.

31
00:03:44,678 --> 00:03:45,058
Thank you.

32
00:03:45,838 --> 00:03:46,839
Member McLaughlin here.

33
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:47,679
Member Russo.

34
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:48,820
Here.

35
00:03:49,447 --> 00:03:50,168
Great, thank you.

36
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:58,275
I know that as the superintendent said that she was in route, driving back to the high school so that might be a moment or two.

37
00:03:59,236 --> 00:04:06,422
And we were just going to get started so I was hoping the superintendent might be able to give us a little bit of background but I do see that.

38
00:04:07,692 --> 00:04:18,976
Principal DeLava is on the call, so if I could ask maybe Principal DeLava if you can give us a little bit of background in terms of, you know, the changes to the student handbook and what occurred.

39
00:04:21,758 --> 00:04:24,379
Sure, so thank you.

40
00:04:24,659 --> 00:04:27,580
And I'm glad to be here, obviously, to answer any questions.

41
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:43,245
I think not so many changes that occurred of more than things that we were focusing on regarding the handbook of reminding some students of some rules that had sort of been lapsed a little bit.

42
00:04:44,085 --> 00:04:49,247
There's no specific changes because that usually goes through our site council.

43
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:55,330
And then our site council presents the handbook from there.

44
00:04:55,850 --> 00:05:06,195
So we did have our 10-point action plan that reflected pieces within the handbook that were currently stated already.

45
00:05:06,975 --> 00:05:15,820
And it was more of a reminder of this is what happens when you do X or when you do Y or Z. That is there.

46
00:05:16,908 --> 00:05:20,430
I see Mrs Hayes has her hand up, so I will be happy to answer any questions.

47
00:05:21,851 --> 00:05:22,411
Thank you.

48
00:05:22,451 --> 00:05:24,012
Yeah, I'm sorry.

49
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,773
I couldn't find the raise hand on my thing.

50
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:26,153
Sorry.

51
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:27,174
I didn't mean to interrupt, but.

52
00:05:29,075 --> 00:05:37,239
So, the original resolution that I wrote that led to this meeting, which I think was, I think I wrote it back in February, but there were.

53
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:44,462
a series of unfortunate events that kind of put this meeting off really wasn't so much about the student handbook.

54
00:05:46,062 --> 00:05:47,862
It was really a more open-ended.

55
00:05:47,922 --> 00:05:53,124
So I'm sorry, Mr. DeLeva, that was a great explanation that I just want to kind of clear up.

56
00:05:53,924 --> 00:06:04,587
So the original resolution was fairly open-ended and it was really came about after the new safety procedures were put in place.

57
00:06:04,707 --> 00:06:05,887
I had at some point

58
00:06:06,697 --> 00:06:10,860
pretty soon after the new procedures sent an email to administration with some questions.

59
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:29,274
And then I thought, well, this seems like something more that the whole DEI subcommittee maybe should together just talk about in terms of with the new safety procedures in place, thinking about how that impacts the student experience at school.

60
00:06:29,414 --> 00:06:34,158
And really even more specifically, when we think about some of our specific subgroups,

61
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:58,085
how some of like having another resource officer having an increased number of hallway and bathroom monitors, certainly that can have an impact on some of our students of color, thinking about the bath, having some of the bathrooms closed and some of the bathroom restrictions, just how that might impact students with disabilities,

62
00:06:58,588 --> 00:07:08,538
students with any anxieties about using the bathrooms, some of our LGBTQ students who might need a gender neutral bathroom.

63
00:07:08,798 --> 00:07:19,068
So it was more looking a somewhat open-ended kind of brainstorming session about what could be the impact on students.

64
00:07:19,409 --> 00:07:20,390
And from that,

65
00:07:21,652 --> 00:07:28,534
Are there things that the school committee might want to either get more information about from administration?

66
00:07:29,154 --> 00:07:37,477
Might there be data that we'd like to request, you know, put in, send up to the school committee as a whole to say, do we want to

67
00:07:38,071 --> 00:07:43,393
ask for a report about this, things like that.

68
00:07:43,593 --> 00:07:46,034
Or even, I lost my train of thought.

69
00:07:46,074 --> 00:07:47,494
There was a third thing I was thinking.

70
00:07:48,555 --> 00:07:49,835
Well, oh, policies.

71
00:07:49,935 --> 00:08:06,380
Are there any policies we might wanna think about that would be related to when there's a change like this for students and how we address the possible unintended consequences

72
00:08:08,302 --> 00:08:14,443
procedures and policies like, or it's not really policies, these are new procedures, procedures like this and how they impact students.

73
00:08:14,864 --> 00:08:17,104
So that was kind of the broad question.

74
00:08:17,144 --> 00:08:33,448
It was a very, I know it was a very broad resolution, but really was a chance for kind of, I guess, all of us together with administration to just think about these new procedures from the student perspective and in particular, some of our

75
00:08:34,964 --> 00:08:38,526
some of our more marginalized students and how might it impact their experience?

76
00:08:40,348 --> 00:08:44,711
So I could sort of give an overview of what I see, if that's okay.

77
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:56,539
Regarding that, so like if we're talking about the bathrooms, what has been more noticeable is with our limit of how many students we're allowing in a bathroom,

78
00:08:57,472 --> 00:08:59,013
right, that's being monitored.

79
00:08:59,553 --> 00:09:13,023
We're seeing lines of students, you know, outside waiting to go to the bathroom, where typically, you know, was on, you wouldn't see these lines before.

80
00:09:13,683 --> 00:09:24,931
So, you know, the other part of it too is, so nobody gets in trouble, we, between classes, we close, right, so that there's a monitor in place

81
00:09:25,812 --> 00:09:43,195
But then you reopen so what you're seeing is a little bit more students out of class right because to access the bathroom they have to get the pass in order to to access the bathroom, which can also delay time of going back to class right because you have.

82
00:09:44,356 --> 00:09:50,678
No matter how many bathrooms we have open, there's still lines of students that are waiting to use the bathroom.

83
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:55,760
That being said, we've had individual bathrooms open.

84
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,501
Obviously, we don't want anybody not being able to use the bathroom.

85
00:09:59,001 --> 00:10:02,622
For example, we do have a gender neutral bathroom here in the main office.

86
00:10:03,382 --> 00:10:04,423
I'm actually pointing to it.

87
00:10:05,158 --> 00:10:11,963
right now from here, but that is an avenue for a student that, you know, it's a single stall.

88
00:10:12,724 --> 00:10:19,929
And if they're just having trouble finding a bathroom, obviously we want to try to have as many bathrooms as we possibly can have open our access to.

89
00:10:20,509 --> 00:10:32,418
And then downstairs by behind the theater, as well as another gender neutral bathroom that we are using, but you have to go to the security guard to get the key to, to utilize that bathroom as well.

90
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:34,219
So that's,

91
00:10:35,148 --> 00:10:50,056
I think on a DEI perspective, obviously, you know, you don't want students missing class, but at the same time, you don't want students being uncomfortable and, and, and trying to figure out when, when can I use the bathroom?

92
00:10:50,237 --> 00:10:57,281
So I think that's something, something to keep in mind for this discussion, um, as well.

93
00:10:57,681 --> 00:11:00,342
Um, and again, we talked about the monitoring, um,

94
00:11:04,109 --> 00:11:09,613
I think that's sort of our trials when we're trying to keep bathrooms open too.

95
00:11:10,474 --> 00:11:19,921
Because the way that we had figured some of this out is teachers were also using loss of prep in order to do this.

96
00:11:20,001 --> 00:11:25,065
But if a teacher's out, we have to shuffle and re-scramble to figure out who's what.

97
00:11:25,606 --> 00:11:32,151
Or if, for instance, we need to cover classes, that takes the priority over the bathroom monitoring.

98
00:11:32,957 --> 00:11:34,157
Uh, that occurs as well.

99
00:11:34,257 --> 00:11:46,221
So, um, I'll leave it at that just as a start starting a springboard point, um, of what I've been seeing, um, throughout the time since we've implemented the, uh, the procedures.

100
00:11:50,382 --> 00:11:52,202
I guess I would add, oh, sorry.

101
00:11:52,382 --> 00:11:54,743
Uh, member, um, Hayes, just a moment.

102
00:11:54,923 --> 00:12:01,645
Um, I guess I would also add if there's any, I'd be curious if there's any sort of data collection on, on, um,

103
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:15,188
you know, any student increase in, you know, either behavior referrals or requests to leave classrooms or anything like that based on any subgroup population.

104
00:12:16,489 --> 00:12:21,992
And these new procedures, that could always be helpful to take a look at, but member Hayes.

105
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:26,815
Thanks.

106
00:12:26,855 --> 00:12:30,457
Yeah, I was going to basically ask the same question about data in terms of

107
00:12:31,234 --> 00:12:34,077
just the things that Mr. DeLevo just spoke about with the bathroom.

108
00:12:34,137 --> 00:12:37,301
And I'm just curious, again, as you said, Ms.

109
00:12:37,321 --> 00:12:40,685
McLaughlin, are there any data being kept?

110
00:12:41,045 --> 00:12:42,267
Is there a way to keep data?

111
00:12:42,327 --> 00:12:47,613
Maybe we can brainstorm about that in terms of, you know, how much class are kids missing?

112
00:12:48,694 --> 00:12:49,875
Do we have any way of

113
00:12:51,495 --> 00:12:56,158
finding out from students kind of what they're, how they're feeling about missing class.

114
00:12:56,238 --> 00:13:11,527
I know at one point, I think at a meeting, I thought a student spoke up, one of our student reps said something about having a hard time getting to an open bathroom and I don't know about students who might be anxious about missing class and how that's working out.

115
00:13:11,968 --> 00:13:19,152
Again, just kind of that whole idea of how can we, as a group, can we brainstorm ways to kind of figure out one,

116
00:13:19,719 --> 00:13:20,860
Is this a problem at all?

117
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:25,043
And if it is, what can we do to alleviate some of those problems?

118
00:13:26,944 --> 00:13:29,365
Because these are all new procedures and works in progress.

119
00:13:33,888 --> 00:13:35,970
Sorry, can I, can I, yeah.

120
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:37,571
Principal DeLava please.

121
00:13:38,111 --> 00:13:43,815
Um, so one thing that has been implemented this year is the hall pass system.

122
00:13:44,496 --> 00:13:55,366
The all pass system if it's being utilized correctly in each class when a student is requesting to use a pass or to go to the bathroom or anything like that.

123
00:13:55,386 --> 00:13:59,749
It indicates a timer so we know the students where they're going.

124
00:14:01,533 --> 00:14:04,014
and the time it takes them to come back.

125
00:14:04,054 --> 00:14:06,895
There's a little bit of challenges with it that I've seen.

126
00:14:06,935 --> 00:14:14,038
So for example, I'm teaching a class, definitely allow the kid out, I hit the start button, right?

127
00:14:14,738 --> 00:14:16,699
Then all of a sudden they come back.

128
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:22,541
Sometimes it happens, you're in the middle of instruction, so you forget to end the pass, right?

129
00:14:23,021 --> 00:14:25,402
So sometimes what happens is on E-Haul Pass,

130
00:14:26,822 --> 00:14:32,564
If a 30-minute time lags, it shuts down the hall pass after 30 minutes.

131
00:14:33,504 --> 00:14:46,387
If we're gone 10 minutes, you'd have to be constantly watching it, but I mean, if you're gone 10 minutes, for example, you start to see the pass go to yellow because the student's been out of class for 10 minutes.

132
00:14:48,317 --> 00:14:58,019
The point that I'm trying to make, though, is that we can get history reports of who is out and then.

133
00:14:58,039 --> 00:14:58,999
I don't know.

134
00:14:59,019 --> 00:15:07,580
I mean, we'd have to do some cross-referencing when you're talking about the type of student as well.

135
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:13,441
I'm going to get the whole gamut of the whole school that is utilizing eHaulPass.

136
00:15:14,362 --> 00:15:16,662
So there'll have to be some cross-referencing regarding

137
00:15:17,778 --> 00:15:25,864
Who's got so many passes versus, you know, you know, the, whatever subgroup you're trying to identify.

138
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:31,908
I hope that made sense.

139
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:36,492
Can I jump in for a 2nd, please.

140
00:15:37,525 --> 00:15:52,388
I guess, so I guess maybe a good place to back up that is to ask is administration collecting data on any of the maybe that's the first step and say, are you collecting data on kind of impact both intended and unintended of the new procedures.

141
00:15:53,436 --> 00:15:57,720
both on students in general, but also, again, as we talk about some of these subgroups.

142
00:15:58,281 --> 00:16:16,737
And, you know, I think originally one of my main concerns when I wrote the resolution was thinking about with the increased adult monitoring and with, well, really just that, the increased adults who are really kind of monitoring where students are going and what they're doing.

143
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:28,626
Certainly with students of color, that could have an impact both in terms of are there differences in who's being spoken to more often or getting referrals?

144
00:16:29,726 --> 00:16:41,229
And even beyond that, just how, has there been discussion with these students or any attempt to kind of figure out, is it affecting them from a mental health perspective?

145
00:16:41,289 --> 00:16:43,449
Like, are they feeling uncomfortable with this?

146
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,090
Since we know that, you know,

147
00:16:47,337 --> 00:16:49,918
there's data everywhere to show that that can certainly be an issue.

148
00:16:51,259 --> 00:17:10,448
So, I mean, I can say that, you know, the way I look at things is we deal with things on case-by-case basis, in a sense, you know, things that get referred to us, there are things that come up to my level, there's things that stay at the assistant principal level, because they work closely with the families as well as

149
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:18,033
The students, but that being said, you know, I tend to take a look at.

150
00:17:19,636 --> 00:17:22,462
We have a dashboard on school brains and I tend to look at.

151
00:17:23,483 --> 00:17:29,327
like a pie chart of the whole school, because to me, like the whole school is what I'm looking at, right?

152
00:17:30,228 --> 00:17:37,254
I agree with you, like sometimes teasing out, like I said before, teasing out certain subgroups, it's doable.

153
00:17:37,434 --> 00:17:39,535
It's time consuming, obviously, but it's doable.

154
00:17:39,996 --> 00:17:44,939
But I want to look at something that, you know, procedural wise was something that was huge that,

155
00:17:45,818 --> 00:17:50,040
has been diminishing through the years, which was our class cuts.

156
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:55,102
Like that still becomes, you saw Mr. Welch's report as well.

157
00:17:56,503 --> 00:18:06,007
That is still something that has come up time and time and time and time and time again as a referral basis of us figuring it out.

158
00:18:06,067 --> 00:18:11,070
Now we're looking at the number of reductions of class cuts.

159
00:18:12,114 --> 00:18:21,056
uh, that are occurring throughout the year, because no matter what, if I run any report and I've run a couple, that's always our number one gamut.

160
00:18:21,296 --> 00:18:21,456
And.

161
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:27,997
You know, the hard part for me, what I'm identifying more is it's a lot with our ninth graders.

162
00:18:28,457 --> 00:18:38,219
It seems like our upperclassmen are, are towing the line, but our ninth graders are still trying to figure out how to navigate through the building.

163
00:18:39,239 --> 00:18:39,339
Um,

164
00:18:40,313 --> 00:18:50,563
So, I don't, again, I don't think I'm answering your question completely, but I'm just trying to give the overview of what has been occurring of what we've been seeing and what we've been dealing with.

165
00:18:51,384 --> 00:18:58,170
But we are looking at data, we're not just dealing with it in one sense, we are looking at data as well.

166
00:18:59,211 --> 00:19:03,393
We meet once a week, assistant principals and I, and we go through this data.

167
00:19:04,234 --> 00:19:06,595
And we try to hit some things.

168
00:19:06,655 --> 00:19:11,077
And then assistant principals also talk to me of like, OK, this is something I've been dealing with.

169
00:19:12,878 --> 00:19:22,623
Let's put all four heads together, or six of us, right, Mr. Fallon included, to figure out solutions to help navigate.

170
00:19:28,675 --> 00:19:29,015
Thank you.

171
00:19:31,677 --> 00:19:32,718
Thank you, Mr. Delabro.

172
00:19:32,758 --> 00:19:33,358
Superintendent?

173
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:38,142
Yes, I just wanted to... Sorry.

174
00:19:39,883 --> 00:19:40,584
Give me one second.

175
00:19:40,604 --> 00:19:41,104
That's an echo.

176
00:19:52,719 --> 00:20:00,528
I just wanted to share, based on the question that was being asked about the specific data related to

177
00:20:04,504 --> 00:20:10,568
are the demographics of the students being monitored.

178
00:20:11,289 --> 00:20:28,340
And I have said it in maybe different arenas, but as we were working on stabilizing the high school and looking at the behaviors that were happening, we were truly dealing with, if we had students cutting classes,

179
00:20:29,781 --> 00:20:34,865
If it was a higher number that happened to be students of color.

180
00:20:34,885 --> 00:20:44,853
It was, we need to get students back into the classrooms to ensure that the building in everyone was safe and in a secure space.

181
00:20:48,220 --> 00:21:06,680
When you were just asking about the DEI perspective, I want to just say that yes, we do look at the work through diversity, equity, and inclusion, but we also looked at how the high school was functioning and making sure that students were where they needed to be.

182
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:12,702
I want to say that yes, we can look at it.

183
00:21:13,523 --> 00:21:20,128
Always keep that in mind, but also keep in mind that we do want students to be inside their classrooms.

184
00:21:22,361 --> 00:21:23,662
and not in the hallways.

185
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:26,963
So I just wanted to say that that was something.

186
00:21:27,003 --> 00:21:35,987
As I've spoken to students in the hallway, I escorted students back to a class and they weren't doing anything.

187
00:21:36,027 --> 00:21:42,710
They were just sitting on a bench, talking and laughing, but they needed to be in class and their teacher was waiting for them.

188
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:46,872
And their teacher was grateful that I escorted them back to the classroom.

189
00:21:47,232 --> 00:21:48,853
So I just wanna say that,

190
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:59,932
that even if we go and we disaggregate it by that, it's really just trying to make sure that all students are where they need to be.

191
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:05,493
I don't know if that makes any sense, but I just wanted to say that piece.

192
00:22:12,435 --> 00:22:14,155
Sorry, Member Hayes, I didn't see your hand up.

193
00:22:14,376 --> 00:22:14,916
Member Hayes?

194
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:15,676
Thank you.

195
00:22:17,553 --> 00:22:30,156
So I just wanna be clear that this resolution was not questioning the need and the critical need at that moment for something to change because there were some pretty major issues at the high school.

196
00:22:30,536 --> 00:22:43,399
So the question is not necessarily about the intended consequences and certainly the intended consequences were to have students in class and really to help students feel safer at school.

197
00:22:44,379 --> 00:22:45,219
And I don't think that

198
00:22:45,917 --> 00:22:52,123
That's not the question of this particular subcommittee meeting or the resolution I put forward.

199
00:22:52,503 --> 00:23:07,876
It really is, again, looking at some of the possibly unintended consequences and how do we assess and evaluate now that we're several months out, what's the impact on students and are there any unintended impacts?

200
00:23:08,037 --> 00:23:12,441
Because certainly, as I said at the beginning, although I don't know, maybe you weren't here yet,

201
00:23:13,895 --> 00:23:38,043
superintendent but you know some of the some of the questions I brought up were questions of you know unintended some of those unintended consequences are certain students being spoken to more often in the hallways now that there's more monitors are some students feeling less comfortable actually feeling less comfortable in the building if there's more adults

202
00:23:38,668 --> 00:23:40,050
kind of overseeing them.

203
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:52,011
Are there students who might find it difficult to access bathrooms now that they're closed and that might make them anxious or uncomfortable just, you know, thinking about students with disabilities?

204
00:23:52,447 --> 00:23:55,490
students with anxieties about finding a bathroom.

205
00:23:55,510 --> 00:24:08,944
I think Mr. Lave already spoke to the LGBTQ population, but certainly, you know, depending on where they are in the building, getting to the main office in that one bathroom could be pretty difficult.

206
00:24:08,984 --> 00:24:11,386
And so just trying to think through some of those

207
00:24:12,287 --> 00:24:38,043
And how are we giving students a voice to let us know about that and how are we looking at any data that we have or do we need to talk about how we could get more data to better understand now that we're, again, we're past the emergency phase, how do we now move on and start looking at the other impacts or potential impacts of these new procedures and moving forward

208
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:45,123
Are they going to be, you know, if we, if they're going to be continued next year, maybe we need to have a better sense of how they're actually.

209
00:24:47,024 --> 00:24:51,008
Working for the students in terms of how they're feeling about being in school.

210
00:25:05,291 --> 00:25:07,972
So member Hayes, I think you bring up a very good point.

211
00:25:09,153 --> 00:25:20,019
One of the things that I know we had done was we had our listening sessions and we still try to do sort of a monthly check-in with certain groups.

212
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:30,605
But that being said, there's a balance of people that wanna have a voice and there's an imbalance of people that,

213
00:25:31,885 --> 00:25:36,267
won't speak up or can't speak up for themselves, I think is what you're trying to put up.

214
00:25:36,528 --> 00:25:53,037
So when I see people in those listening sessions, I'm not seeing the peers that probably wouldn't speak up or think things are status quo and not say how they're really feeling.

215
00:25:53,097 --> 00:25:59,661
So I think one of the points that I'm trying to wrestle with my brain is of what you're saying is how do I get

216
00:26:00,461 --> 00:26:17,175
Those students, not, and I don't want to say typical because that's not the word I want to use but you know we have a certain population when the school where they're very articulate and very can voice lots of concerns and can speak for others, part of our student government things like that that we have.

217
00:26:19,365 --> 00:26:24,107
But that being said, there is a population that can't speak up for themselves.

218
00:26:24,308 --> 00:26:27,069
And therefore, how do we get them into the forefront?

219
00:26:27,109 --> 00:26:48,140
I guess I'm throwing it back to get ideas that maybe you may have that I don't have, because I do see your point regarding, I think what you were stating regarding how to know how a student's feeling as they're walking through the high school, someone that typically wouldn't speak up per se.

220
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:54,535
Thank you.

221
00:26:54,595 --> 00:26:58,917
Yeah, well, actually I'm hoping that that's something we can all brainstorm together.

222
00:26:58,937 --> 00:27:05,180
I know that we have the, and I'm sorry, I hope it's okay, Member McLaughlin, that I jumped in.

223
00:27:06,061 --> 00:27:12,584
We have now given the student survey, and certainly that will hopefully provide some data.

224
00:27:12,644 --> 00:27:15,866
I'm not sure exactly what the,

225
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:21,171
questions were and whether they'll be conducive to getting this kind of information.

226
00:27:21,231 --> 00:27:26,753
But, you know, I guess, looking at, are there more informal surveys we can do?

227
00:27:27,013 --> 00:27:32,395
Are there, I don't know, I'm hoping there's others that have other ideas of how we could

228
00:27:34,056 --> 00:27:37,922
get more information from the students, allow them more of an opportunity to speak.

229
00:27:38,302 --> 00:27:44,151
I, you know, I think that, as you said, Mr. DeLiva, that those listening sessions really are wonderful.

230
00:27:44,171 --> 00:27:46,314
I think they've been a great new addition.

231
00:27:46,334 --> 00:27:47,837
I'm hoping that maybe they'll

232
00:27:49,289 --> 00:27:51,691
They'll get, sorry about that, they'll get more formalized.

233
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:57,594
Sorry, now I totally lost my train of thought.

234
00:27:58,915 --> 00:28:12,184
But oh, but I agree with you that I think there are students, even if it's a, I don't know what those listening sessions exactly look like, even a small listening session, there are certainly students who might feel comfortable speaking up.

235
00:28:12,244 --> 00:28:16,507
And so how do we make sure we get all of those students

236
00:28:17,378 --> 00:28:21,245
make sure they all have an opportunity to let us know what the impact is on them.

237
00:28:24,571 --> 00:28:28,918
There is another indirect survey that occurs, believe it or not, during MCAS.

238
00:28:31,274 --> 00:28:32,275
Because we do it every year.

239
00:28:33,135 --> 00:28:38,139
So actually tomorrow, after session two, the students take a questionnaire that the state puts out.

240
00:28:38,239 --> 00:28:44,844
And we have that data as well to coincide with the other data that we have.

241
00:28:44,904 --> 00:28:46,285
So I like that data.

242
00:28:46,325 --> 00:28:47,265
It's called VOCALDATA.

243
00:28:47,285 --> 00:28:49,547
I forget what the, again, so many acronyms.

244
00:28:49,607 --> 00:29:00,154
But it's actually in the Dropbox that we can download and kind of identify some certain factors and compare it to what we do with MCAS.

245
00:29:01,175 --> 00:29:15,218
what the district said, what did the state say, you know, I think that's important to also look at as well, because not that I'm saying that, you know, we care about Medford, Medford's our community, that's it.

246
00:29:15,418 --> 00:29:25,440
We also know things are occurring in other communities that are similar, so it's good to know certain points, like, oh, that's happening, or, you know,

247
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:43,201
I try to do what's called the dart, which takes it's takes Medford high school and compares it to the same demographics and all of that I am glad you're nodding your head so you know what I'm talking about, but I just look at that data in general like enrollment, things like that to see.

248
00:29:43,909 --> 00:29:48,912
And it compares it to a school, you can find a school that's similar to demographics.

249
00:29:48,952 --> 00:30:00,398
So if I see that, I can look at that vocal data and then drill down on that other school and try to figure out, hey, what are you seeing in your school that's different than mine?

250
00:30:00,518 --> 00:30:02,979
I'm in constant contact with the Malden High School principal too.

251
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:08,683
We talk all the time and I try to say to him like, what are you seeing?

252
00:30:09,003 --> 00:30:10,664
Is that something that you see now again?

253
00:30:11,831 --> 00:30:13,272
I would say there's different communities.

254
00:30:13,332 --> 00:30:19,315
Malden is, and I'm putting it in reverse, is just more diverse than Medford is.

255
00:30:20,016 --> 00:30:32,283
So he tries to give me things that he's dealing with, like what you're saying, memories of dealing with certain subgroups and how much they're being talked to or spoken to and all of that.

256
00:30:33,663 --> 00:30:36,625
So I just want to point out there is other data out there too.

257
00:30:37,646 --> 00:30:39,467
So hopefully when we get the survey,

258
00:30:40,435 --> 00:30:44,796
Hopefully when the vocal data comes out too, that's something we can cross-reference as well.

259
00:30:52,118 --> 00:30:59,020
I think data collection sounds like a good idea just in terms of ensuring, you know, again, the equity piece.

260
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:09,223
And I would be curious as to Member Hayes' reflection on the data collection and sort of how you would want to

261
00:31:10,749 --> 00:31:14,657
I don't know, reconvene to consider that or what are you thinking?

262
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:21,191
I guess I'm not.

263
00:31:22,042 --> 00:31:26,663
clear, you mean we convene to consider what kinds of data we would like to have, or?

264
00:31:26,683 --> 00:31:49,010
No, what the data is saying, essentially, if they're going to be using more data to sort of, if the proposal is to sort of use data to sort of, to see how this is affecting the students, both with the student survey that's currently out in this informal recording that Mr. DeLave was just talking about from the MCAS and others, you know, is it a discussion that you want to have

265
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:50,730
to reconvene around data.

266
00:31:50,770 --> 00:32:01,234
I mean, I think it's a little tricky to have this discussion sort of in an ambiguous way without knowing exactly what it is we're dealing with or looking for.

267
00:32:01,274 --> 00:32:09,977
So we're saying, yeah, we want to look at this information and consider all the ways that these new procedures could impact

268
00:32:11,036 --> 00:32:12,797
underrepresented populations.

269
00:32:12,997 --> 00:32:15,940
And so what is the way in which to do that?

270
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:21,143
And then how would we be able to review that once that occurs?

271
00:32:25,206 --> 00:32:39,957
Again, I guess I was hoping that was part of the brainstorming session with all of us is to talk about different experiences we've all had, you know, in our different jobs or parts of our lives with different types of ways to gather data, whether it's surveys,

272
00:32:40,437 --> 00:32:47,518
whether it's focus groups, I'm just trying to figure out how we can get, we now have the student survey that will be coming through, which is wonderful.

273
00:32:48,819 --> 00:33:10,223
How can we do that on a more, you know, a more regular basis, whatever regular timeframe we would want it to be, but also getting teachers and, you know, families, I just think, again, getting all of those voices in there, the ones who are, you know, who are experiencing the impacts of these new,

274
00:33:10,683 --> 00:33:21,010
safety procedures, and so understanding from their perspectives what it looks like during the course of the day for them, and both the positives and the negatives.

275
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:30,857
And, you know, that would allow us better to understand which ones are working well, if there are any that aren't working well, or whether some need to be tweaked or changed.

276
00:33:30,958 --> 00:33:32,879
But again, you know,

277
00:33:33,562 --> 00:33:48,905
There's no question that we needed some new safety procedures, but I think the reflection piece, we haven't really had a lot of the reflection piece yet on those procedures and what the experience is for those who are actually living with them.

278
00:33:49,425 --> 00:34:01,387
So again, this was originally written back in February, and we're a bit away from it now, but I think it's still an open question on how we continue to get

279
00:34:01,946 --> 00:34:05,548
That kind of information, so we know how these these are working.

280
00:34:06,469 --> 00:34:07,729
Thank you superintendent.

281
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:13,353
I definitely am in support of that.

282
00:34:13,373 --> 00:34:14,533
I just came from.

283
00:34:15,995 --> 00:34:28,642
a listening session at one of the elementary schools I was over at the Miss attack and working with them there, I think, as, especially here at the high school, as the year is winding down.

284
00:34:30,243 --> 00:34:35,967
Freshman semi formal and senior coming up and senior prom coming up graduation the first week of June.

285
00:34:37,608 --> 00:34:57,343
that as the year is winding down, it would be a great opportunity to reach out to the high school staff to offer some additional listening sessions to get feedback from the teachers about

286
00:34:58,709 --> 00:35:11,739
what strategies or what structures that were implemented this year that they felt had a positive impact and made a difference and a change so we could gather that information.

287
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:17,543
And that is something definitely we can do.

288
00:35:18,164 --> 00:35:24,668
We have a little bit of time when the school year ends at the high school level.

289
00:35:25,149 --> 00:35:25,829
We have a few,

290
00:35:28,628 --> 00:35:33,109
half days for students so we can try to work creatively with some of that time.

291
00:35:33,129 --> 00:35:40,611
Because some of that time is also used for planning for the summer and for the new coursework.

292
00:35:40,651 --> 00:35:42,152
So we could try to figure it out.

293
00:35:42,672 --> 00:35:52,454
But I think that is something that I can definitely work on gathering the data and working collaboratively with Mr. DeLeva and Mr. Fallon.

294
00:35:54,536 --> 00:36:01,941
to gather some of that informal feedback and even do, possibly see if you can do surveys.

295
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:17,633
But I do feel there is something about the in-person, personal, like face-to-face conversation that when people talk and share their ideas, you actually can capture more information from that.

296
00:36:18,073 --> 00:36:19,394
So that could definitely be,

297
00:36:20,755 --> 00:36:27,237
an action item to meet with the staff and talk with the staff about that.

298
00:36:27,837 --> 00:36:39,961
So as we, you know, get ready for a new year, we'll be able to start that new year strong and learn, you know, we've learned a lot.

299
00:36:40,241 --> 00:36:45,062
We have learned a lot, but to continue to build upon that learning.

300
00:36:47,206 --> 00:37:12,060
I don't know if that is amenable to the committee members, but it's something that I definitely would be willing to just, you know, let, communicate to the staff that, you know, we want to hear from you so that, you know, as we go into the summer and we're planning, that we learn from their experiences and hear what it is that they want to share with us.

301
00:37:18,692 --> 00:37:19,352
Member Hayes.

302
00:37:20,933 --> 00:37:24,054
Thanks, yes, I mean, I think that's I agree with you.

303
00:37:24,094 --> 00:37:25,035
I think that.

304
00:37:25,995 --> 00:37:29,036
The listening sessions are a valuable tool and the face to face.

305
00:37:30,037 --> 00:37:46,764
I would ask maybe that we also if there is a way to have a. I think for some people, the face to face can actually be more difficult, and so I think that having both types having a face to face, but also having maybe a written or more.

306
00:37:48,749 --> 00:38:01,319
I don't know, anonymous or at least less confrontational, which is not quite the right word, but a way for people who might feel more comfortable doing it in a different way, just to get as much information as we can as we move forward.

307
00:38:05,542 --> 00:38:06,223
Principal DeLeva?

308
00:38:06,243 --> 00:38:09,966
And I think to piggyback off of that, Member Hayes, is that

309
00:38:10,906 --> 00:38:13,647
What, you know, with data, it's always interesting, right?

310
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:16,788
Because you can make it tell a story in so many different ways.

311
00:38:18,849 --> 00:38:26,892
And I think one of the key points is to see all the data points, and then we tease out what we're looking for, right?

312
00:38:27,032 --> 00:38:30,133
Because I think that sometimes gets lost in translation as well.

313
00:38:30,853 --> 00:38:32,094
Like I could give you data.

314
00:38:33,766 --> 00:38:42,938
And, you know, it could be like something that tells a story based on what I made it out to be but doesn't mean it's what you're looking for.

315
00:38:43,598 --> 00:38:46,742
So we kind of talk about this a lot of things too, I've been trying to

316
00:38:48,973 --> 00:38:58,195
digress on an academic level, I'm trying to find out data points to identify students that need more support, right?

317
00:38:58,215 --> 00:39:05,256
So teasing out not just MCAS, but how are we going to get MAP in there and how are we going to get that in there?

318
00:39:05,296 --> 00:39:13,538
And then it all comes together and builds sort of a profile so that as an instructional leader, I can say, OK, this person

319
00:39:14,555 --> 00:39:22,744
I got to get, I got to get something for this person like they need it and they need it now and all these data points are pointing into this certain direction.

320
00:39:23,565 --> 00:39:29,912
And one of the other things I tend to use is the is a tool in Edwin analytics called early warning.

321
00:39:31,136 --> 00:39:41,180
So it kind of has been looking at student, like I said, student MCAT scores, student attendance rates, things like that throughout the years, but before they even get to high school.

322
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:50,583
And then I can try to identify those students as well of like, okay, these are students that possibly need to start off in our Nexus program.

323
00:39:51,383 --> 00:39:53,165
for example, and work its way in.

324
00:39:54,166 --> 00:40:09,763
But I guess the point that I'm trying to make is, unless we know all the data points first, and then we sit down together and say, OK, I feel like we should definitely look at this, we should definitely look at that, and put that together.

325
00:40:09,843 --> 00:40:13,667
So just a suggestion moving forward.

326
00:40:33,058 --> 00:40:38,382
And I also say that, member Russo, I love your background of your Japanese motif.

327
00:40:41,544 --> 00:40:43,746
I got the idea from Sharon, bad member Hayes.

328
00:40:47,869 --> 00:40:50,170
I didn't have the pretty flowers though.

329
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:50,991
You stepped it up.

330
00:40:54,774 --> 00:41:01,218
So I guess, can we make a motion to, well, I don't want to make a motion before talking about what that motion would be.

331
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:04,072
We have the student survey.

332
00:41:04,092 --> 00:41:10,299
I don't know how long it takes to get the data and to really work with the interpretation of that.

333
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:20,071
And then, you know, if we did if If you were able to do something with the teachers listening sessions and or something else.

334
00:41:20,571 --> 00:41:20,932
Is there

335
00:41:22,916 --> 00:41:25,899
Would we want to come back to this committee?

336
00:41:25,979 --> 00:41:27,800
Again, I'm throwing out this question to everyone.

337
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:38,109
Would we want to come back to this committee with some of that information and talk about it before, I don't know, going to the full committee with it?

338
00:41:38,309 --> 00:41:48,557
Or do we want to just make a motion to have all that information brought to either the last school committee this year or, I don't know, that's coming up sooner than I imagine.

339
00:41:51,289 --> 00:41:53,031
next year, the beginning of next year.

340
00:41:54,872 --> 00:41:55,493
Suggestions?

341
00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:58,615
Member Russo and then Superintendent.

342
00:41:59,756 --> 00:42:00,136
Thank you.

343
00:42:00,497 --> 00:42:06,502
I think we do have a report policy, procedure, whatever the right word is.

344
00:42:07,382 --> 00:42:15,649
And I think it would be helpful to, well, obviously, it's our rule that we should be following that.

345
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:18,712
But most importantly,

346
00:42:19,448 --> 00:42:26,393
more importantly than the rules in this case, is us literally writing out exactly what it is we want.

347
00:42:27,774 --> 00:42:34,879
Because otherwise we have meetings, we think we said what we wanted, we come back and then we have five meetings to get to what we want.

348
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:36,940
And if we can't say what we want,

349
00:42:38,554 --> 00:42:41,476
Sort of like, if you don't know what your question is, don't expect the right answer.

350
00:42:43,198 --> 00:42:47,481
That's not a dig at you or anything, that's just like a general thing I try to tell my kids.

351
00:42:51,004 --> 00:43:00,371
And I think the full committee should decide whether to approve the report and the superintendent should have the opportunity to say that is a

352
00:43:01,085 --> 00:43:08,751
you know, five hour effort or is that an FTE for two months, which is really created the report procedure in the first place.

353
00:43:10,312 --> 00:43:11,593
Thank you, Superintendent.

354
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:30,083
Um, I was going to say, especially where we are with two meetings left to regular meetings left for the year, and they were going to be, you know, the, the, the.

355
00:43:31,384 --> 00:43:36,126
current amount of subcommittees that we already have, plus the budget meetings that we're doing.

356
00:43:38,206 --> 00:43:54,132
Just from a data perspective, I think gathering the data from the teachers at the end of this year, giving us time to look at that data when we receive the other student survey data, and to be able to digest it and look at it.

357
00:43:54,432 --> 00:43:58,013
And I think to actually be able to digest

358
00:43:59,594 --> 00:44:14,845
all of that data and to be able to, you know, coherently say this is what everything is saying, you know, by the last meeting of the year, I just think it would be rushing critically important data.

359
00:44:15,646 --> 00:44:27,694
And I think we can have it, look at it and think about what is the data saying, and it would be appropriate to report out to the committee on some of those data points

360
00:44:29,156 --> 00:44:30,417
at the start of the school year.

361
00:44:32,479 --> 00:44:47,812
Or share with the committee, this is what we have thus far and like do a summary analysis of like, this is what the data said and this is what's, these are the changes that, you know, are being in place.

362
00:44:47,872 --> 00:44:54,437
These, you know, these are the changes that aren't gonna be, you know, we're gonna keep this and stop something else.

363
00:44:56,612 --> 00:45:12,948
So I just feel like it's not that I don't wanna report out, but I just don't wanna go and report for the sake of reporting and not have the opportunity to really digest what the information is saying, what is the data saying, and what does it look like?

364
00:45:15,290 --> 00:45:20,496
And I do feel with some of this information, this will need to be shared.

365
00:45:21,542 --> 00:45:40,013
with the incoming principal for her to be able to also think about what her vision is of the school and how the data makes sense in terms of what will be happening next year at the school.

366
00:45:40,453 --> 00:45:47,497
So I just wanna like say, I just think it wouldn't be a wise move to rush to get

367
00:45:49,542 --> 00:46:01,912
you know, to be able to check the box and say, yes, we did it, but not able to properly say, you know, as a result of all of this information, these are the things that are crystallized.

368
00:46:02,352 --> 00:46:09,177
These are the shifts that are being made and we're going to continue to progress monitor what is happening.

369
00:46:10,198 --> 00:46:13,461
So even with the start of the new school year,

370
00:46:14,925 --> 00:46:23,448
you know, probably a little more restrictive at the start and then do a gradual release to see what can happen.

371
00:46:23,648 --> 00:46:37,972
That's just me, you know, quickly talking off of the top of my head, but just saying like, there's a lot of thought and strategy and, you know, coordination of the team that needs to take place.

372
00:46:39,552 --> 00:46:41,833
So I'm just asking the committee to consider that.

373
00:47:03,889 --> 00:47:22,335
So superintendent if I understood you accurately you were saying data collection to reconvene in the fall around looking at what what the basically taking the surveys that are currently out looking at that data and potentially the teacher.

374
00:47:26,585 --> 00:47:27,686
What's the word I'm looking for?

375
00:47:28,506 --> 00:47:29,587
Roundtable, if you will.

376
00:47:30,668 --> 00:47:33,970
You know, that as well, and having that data and coming back.

377
00:47:35,411 --> 00:47:43,357
Were you saying to the subcommittee or were you saying to the committee as a whole to sort of give information about how this is or isn't working?

378
00:47:44,257 --> 00:47:47,739
I mean, I think I'm open to both.

379
00:47:47,779 --> 00:47:50,020
I wouldn't mind presenting it at a regular meeting.

380
00:47:50,200 --> 00:48:06,286
And just as you were talking about data collection, by conducting the listening sessions, doing some kind of a survey with the teachers, looking at the data, letting the school year start in September,

381
00:48:08,247 --> 00:48:21,015
we could once again do a teacher listening session at the start of the school year and just ask them for quick feedback and report out to the larger committee to say, this is what the data has said.

382
00:48:21,055 --> 00:48:22,916
We gathered this at the end of the year.

383
00:48:23,336 --> 00:48:25,757
This is what they're saying right at the start of the school year.

384
00:48:26,258 --> 00:48:27,618
This is what we're seeing right now.

385
00:48:27,859 --> 00:48:29,680
And we will continue to progress monitor.

386
00:48:31,181 --> 00:48:31,541
Thank you.

387
00:48:31,581 --> 00:48:33,442
I'm curious, member Hayes, what you think of that?

388
00:48:38,042 --> 00:48:40,985
I mean, I think that would be great for start.

389
00:48:41,025 --> 00:48:49,435
I guess I'm also, and maybe this would be for another meeting to talk more about it, but kind of talking about ongoing data collection.

390
00:48:49,455 --> 00:48:55,202
If these restrictions or these safety procedures continue, I think

391
00:48:55,855 --> 00:48:59,916
gathering ongoing data about the impact on teachers and students.

392
00:48:59,976 --> 00:49:17,041
And, you know, I think it's really important whenever something that really is a significant change in the way the school is run, especially for the experience of the students themselves, that we continue to look at data of how it's impacting them and whether it's having the intended consequences.

393
00:49:17,101 --> 00:49:21,602
Again, I keep coming back to this, but the intended consequences and the unintended consequences.

394
00:49:22,336 --> 00:49:27,930
to ensure that we keep looking for that because I think that is our responsibility to do that.

395
00:49:30,118 --> 00:49:30,518
Thank you.

396
00:49:30,999 --> 00:49:37,923
And I think it's a good start superintendent to, you know, have something to build on in September to have this conversation.

397
00:49:38,203 --> 00:49:39,404
I'm fine.

398
00:49:39,444 --> 00:49:47,368
I don't know how the rest of the members feel about having that conversation as a part of a agenda item on the school committee meeting as a whole.

399
00:49:47,568 --> 00:49:55,713
And then, you know, from there, we can talk about whether, you know, again, to member Hayes' point, whether this should be, you know, dated.

400
00:49:57,414 --> 00:50:07,238
response or data information, particularly around, you know, a topic should be a regular thing or part of a report, as Member Rousseau was saying, or not.

401
00:50:07,258 --> 00:50:21,243
But I think just to sort of get us at a starting point, I think it would be helpful to have, you know, maybe this is an agenda item, maybe, you know, you know, in the end of September ish, so that there's time to collect data would be great.

402
00:50:21,543 --> 00:50:25,565
And if the rest of the members are in agreement with that, I'd be happy to

403
00:50:27,078 --> 00:50:31,581
to say, that's great, and make a motion to adjourn.

404
00:50:31,821 --> 00:50:32,942
So let me know what folks think.

405
00:50:35,104 --> 00:50:36,044
Thumbs up, thumbs down?

406
00:50:36,765 --> 00:50:37,746
Just a quick question.

407
00:50:37,786 --> 00:50:44,030
So we talked at one point, I remember Rousseau was talking about writing the formal request for a report.

408
00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:51,816
Are we talking about doing that, or are we leaving it kind of more open-ended in a sense, but just know that it will go on?

409
00:50:52,156 --> 00:50:54,918
Who will be responsible for making sure it goes on the agenda?

410
00:50:56,150 --> 00:50:56,978
Yeah, I think that.

411
00:50:58,283 --> 00:51:06,648
to members of this point, if you are looking for a full report, then that would be something that would need to go through the policy, you know, that we've already written for a report.

412
00:51:07,168 --> 00:51:17,454
I would recommend having it a little more ambiguous in the terms of following the superintendent's lead around having her present the data at the school committee meeting.

413
00:51:17,494 --> 00:51:26,140
But I think, you know, you can be more specific with both the superintendent and Mr. DeLeva about some of the data points you are

414
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:31,421
maybe specifically looking for, so that it'll be an informed presentation.

415
00:51:32,101 --> 00:51:36,502
That's always something that's just good practice for what you want for the presentation.

416
00:51:36,562 --> 00:51:51,146
And then from that point, you know, after the presentation, if you feel like, you know, if the committee or other members obviously have the prerogative to, you know, feel like they want additional information or they think this should be a regular report or whatever, and then you can follow the procedure from there.

417
00:51:51,186 --> 00:51:56,567
But I think because, you know, my feeling, because this is new and there's

418
00:51:57,568 --> 00:52:14,165
some ambiguity around it and people are still feeling their way through it, that I think it would be good to start with this first step and then see how the data is presented with a clear expectation from an email or what have you about the data that is being looked at.

419
00:52:14,746 --> 00:52:17,669
And then I think it's a matter of literally just emailing

420
00:52:19,829 --> 00:52:32,856
Markey to get it on the agenda for, you know, the second meeting in September, and I would leave that to the superintendent and Markey to be able to make that happen, but I have full confidence that that can happen.

421
00:52:33,416 --> 00:52:41,801
I guess my question was a little more basic than that, like, out of this meeting, do we have a motion that says it will be, you know, in the month of September, we will have a meeting about that or.

422
00:52:42,733 --> 00:52:45,937
how do we leave it from here to present to the rest of the committee?

423
00:52:45,957 --> 00:52:51,286
Because again, I am a little concerned things get lost over the summer.

424
00:52:51,746 --> 00:52:56,453
So I just want to, you know, I don't want, I want to have enough of a

425
00:52:57,133 --> 00:52:58,493
a final outcome of this.

426
00:52:58,913 --> 00:52:59,353
I hear you.

427
00:52:59,774 --> 00:53:02,634
I don't think that we need to make a motion that's your prerogative.

428
00:53:02,834 --> 00:53:19,938
I don't think we need to make a motion we can report out to the whole committee and I can do that as the chair and then I can offer you the opportunity to speak as well if you'd like, you know your prerogative and just share with the rest of the school committee that we had a discussion and we asked for some data points and the superintendent

429
00:53:20,458 --> 00:53:23,622
you know, agreed that she would provide these data points at a meeting in September.

430
00:53:23,802 --> 00:53:29,829
And if you want, you know, for the next meeting, we can ask the superintendent if perhaps you can give us that date for September.

431
00:53:29,849 --> 00:53:32,593
I'm sure Markey can give us that in the meantime.

432
00:53:32,633 --> 00:53:36,317
And that may make things feel a little bit more concrete for you, superintendent.

433
00:53:36,958 --> 00:53:41,420
Yes, I just was going to say I was looking at the September calendar because I don't have.

434
00:53:41,801 --> 00:53:46,843
We haven't put the dates on September 4 is Labor Day so there's no school.

435
00:53:47,344 --> 00:53:51,026
So, we'll, we'll definitely have a meeting on Monday, September 11.

436
00:53:55,096 --> 00:53:58,998
because it's first and third, we're at the second week.

437
00:53:59,418 --> 00:54:03,241
So it's either gonna be the 11th and the 18th or the 18th and the 25th.

438
00:54:03,921 --> 00:54:07,923
So the first Monday in October is October 2nd.

439
00:54:08,463 --> 00:54:18,149
So I actually was gonna say, since school starts on Wednesday, the 30th, we literally would only have, there's two days of school in August.

440
00:54:18,909 --> 00:54:22,591
And then we have that short week and we do,

441
00:54:25,153 --> 00:54:35,864
that I was gonna ask if it could be at the October 2nd meeting, which would just give us between... Yeah, I think that's reasonable just to collect a little bit.

442
00:54:35,884 --> 00:54:44,592
It would give us some time to start school, have a few weeks of data, and then to be able to report out to the committee.

443
00:54:45,433 --> 00:54:46,234
That works for me.

444
00:54:46,674 --> 00:54:47,435
How about you folks?

445
00:54:49,180 --> 00:55:03,661
Yeah, okay so I'm confident with reporting that out member Hayes, I don't think we need a motion to make that happen it seems like it's already happened so, and we are at 556 so I'm going to ask folks is there anything that anybody wants to add I want to thank you all for

446
00:55:04,182 --> 00:55:05,924
taking the time to brainstorm this a little bit.

447
00:55:05,964 --> 00:55:10,288
And I think that it needs to, you know, we'll need to massage it a little bit, we'll see what the data points look like.

448
00:55:10,328 --> 00:55:26,042
And I think that it's really about the conversation, as Member Hayes was saying, and some of the brainstorming about how are we ensuring that this is an equitable, that we are putting in to practice equitable practice for all of our student population, and really considering the impact that, you know,

449
00:55:26,896 --> 00:55:31,318
significant changes can have on more of our underrepresented population.

450
00:55:31,398 --> 00:55:36,300
So I appreciate everybody taking the time to sort of wade your way through this.

451
00:55:36,661 --> 00:55:39,562
And thank you, Member Hayes, for bringing the resolution forward.

452
00:55:40,142 --> 00:55:42,944
And so we'll report this out at the next meeting.

453
00:55:43,684 --> 00:55:45,245
And with that, I make a motion to adjourn.

454
00:55:46,445 --> 00:55:46,745
Second.

455
00:55:48,386 --> 00:55:51,268
Okay, so motion to adjourn, seconded by Member Rousseau.

456
00:55:51,308 --> 00:55:52,348
Roll call, Member Hayes?

457
00:55:52,868 --> 00:55:53,048
Yes.

458
00:55:54,049 --> 00:55:54,829
Member McLaughlin?

459
00:55:54,849 --> 00:55:55,129
Yes.

460
00:55:55,550 --> 00:55:56,110
Member Rousseau?

461
00:55:57,162 --> 00:55:57,431
Yes.

462
00:55:58,380 --> 00:55:58,628
Thank you.
