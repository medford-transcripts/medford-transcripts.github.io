1
00:00:00,391 --> 00:00:01,432

[SPEAKER_05]: Present.

18
00:00:39,505 --> 00:00:40,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Please rise and salute the flag.

19
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:51,815
[SPEAKER_05]: I salute to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

20
00:00:55,511 --> 00:01:07,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Motions, orders, and resolutions 18097, offered by Councilor Mox, be it resolved that the City Council broadcast scrimmage be as discussed.

21
00:01:07,562 --> 00:01:08,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Mox.

22
00:01:10,064 --> 00:01:10,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

23
00:01:11,005 --> 00:01:17,611
[SPEAKER_02]: It was roughly, I think, five or six months ago that this City Council unanimously put forward a motion

24
00:01:18,523 --> 00:01:30,201
[SPEAKER_02]: to request that the broadcasting equipment here at City Hall be updated because of the age of the equipment and the fact that the broadcast itself

25
00:01:31,122 --> 00:01:33,464
[SPEAKER_02]: wasn't going out properly to residents of this community.

26
00:01:34,445 --> 00:01:47,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Shortly after that, Ben Brown, who is the Method Community Media Station Manager, reached out to us in November 30th, and this is his email, Mr. President, to us.

27
00:01:48,637 --> 00:01:50,559
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to just read part of it, if I could.

28
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:59,066
[SPEAKER_02]: It's addressed to the council, and it's regarding the Alden Chambers video upgrade, meeting rooms,

29
00:01:59,706 --> 00:02:01,147
[SPEAKER_02]: and video install.

30
00:02:01,527 --> 00:02:14,554
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, hello, I've received a detailed quote to first upgrade the cameras and broadcast equipment in the Alden Chambers, as well as to install cameras in two meeting rooms in City Hall for the web streaming of meetings.

31
00:02:15,434 --> 00:02:24,259
[SPEAKER_02]: In the first portion of the proposal, the quote details installation of four new cameras, as well as the installation of all new TV equipment in the control room.

32
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:28,701
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a few reasons why this would need to be such a large upgrade.

33
00:02:29,122 --> 00:02:38,188
[SPEAKER_02]: But the primary one is that the existing equipment at the Alden Chambers is so far behind that new equipment can't interface with the old.

34
00:02:38,869 --> 00:02:45,934
[SPEAKER_02]: So Ben did his homework and came up with a cost to upgrade our broadcast equipment of a cost at $39,707.

35
00:02:45,974 --> 00:02:46,774
[SPEAKER_02]: He then went to

36
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:58,560
[SPEAKER_02]: go on to alert us about the web streaming that this council has met on.

37
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:12,463
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Councilor Falco has discussed this on many occasions, to install cameras not only here in the council for transparency, but also in the other rooms in the building where we might have board and commission meetings.

38
00:03:13,183 --> 00:03:26,398
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had several meetings on this and discussed it and was part of the recommendation when the council voted on it to request that Ben also look into the cost to add these particular cameras in the rooms.

39
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:33,667
[SPEAKER_02]: So on that part, he says for the meeting rooms we would be installing a single camera mounted in the corner of the room.

40
00:03:34,153 --> 00:03:37,496
[SPEAKER_02]: as well as two removable microphones that would sit on the table.

41
00:03:38,036 --> 00:03:41,759
[SPEAKER_02]: These would interface directly with the Acela streaming equipment.

42
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,122
[SPEAKER_02]: The cost for web streaming is $7,058.

43
00:03:46,864 --> 00:03:56,051
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you combine the broadcast equipment, which is our equipment here for government channel of 39,707 and 7,058, you come out with $46,765 to accomplish this.

44
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:13,935
[SPEAKER_02]: He also goes on to say, for future consideration, the Alden Chambers system could incrementally be upgraded going forward to prevent such a large upgrade in the future.

45
00:04:14,496 --> 00:04:23,659
[SPEAKER_02]: The standards that are quoted should be around for another 15 to 20 years, which would allow for things to be swapped out rather than rebuilding from the ground up.

46
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,401
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that was very helpful to receive that.

47
00:04:27,975 --> 00:04:33,498
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we've been talking about transparency, this council, for a number of years.

48
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:42,142
[SPEAKER_02]: And I find it ironic now what's going on in this community and the lack of transparency that's taken place.

49
00:04:42,702 --> 00:04:53,127
[SPEAKER_02]: And here we are as a council, been asking just if we can upgrade our equipment so people that are unable to come to these meetings can view the meetings and see what's going on in city government.

50
00:04:54,587 --> 00:05:06,034
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we had for approximately three and a half to four years no cable access when it comes to government channel, I shouldn't say government channel, community access channel.

51
00:05:06,694 --> 00:05:21,242
[SPEAKER_02]: And yet, the rate payers were paying a franchise fee each and every month to operate not only the government channel, the school channel, and the community access channel, but we only got a portion of that.

52
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:33,635
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was surplus money left in the account, hundreds of thousands of dollars, and all we're asking for is a small amount to make sure people can view what's going on in government.

53
00:05:34,035 --> 00:05:34,976
[SPEAKER_02]: We all talk about it.

54
00:05:36,897 --> 00:05:51,425
[SPEAKER_02]: The second part of it, after that November correspondence we received from Ben Brown, the station manager, Councilor Longo responded back to the email and said that she received a number of complaints

55
00:05:52,245 --> 00:05:56,048
[SPEAKER_02]: and that people can't hear the meetings and see the meetings and etc.

56
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:03,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Shahb Khan, who's our Chief Procurement Officer, came back and said, I agree.

57
00:06:04,487 --> 00:06:07,308
[SPEAKER_02]: This vendor is on a state contract for video equipment.

58
00:06:07,728 --> 00:06:09,188
[SPEAKER_02]: We must need to find the funds.

59
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:14,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Without this equipment, the software we bought for the streaming of meetings will not be of any use.

60
00:06:15,349 --> 00:06:22,910
[SPEAKER_02]: So apparently we have the software for streaming the meetings in these other rooms, but we don't have the equipment to stream it with.

61
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:26,711
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was the Chief Procurement Officer stating that.

62
00:06:27,493 --> 00:06:36,321
[SPEAKER_02]: And then recently, we got a final email from Ben Brown, the station manager.

63
00:06:36,682 --> 00:06:38,383
[SPEAKER_02]: This is dated February 21st, 2018.

64
00:06:39,724 --> 00:06:47,432
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's to Jen Dever, Ed Finn, Lauren Felch, the city council.

65
00:06:47,792 --> 00:06:48,593
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, good morning.

66
00:06:49,073 --> 00:06:53,197
[SPEAKER_02]: I've received extensive complaints about the quality of city council broadcast.

67
00:06:53,694 --> 00:06:59,500
[SPEAKER_02]: And these quality issues are directly related to the age of the equipment that's in the room broadcasting the meetings.

68
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:04,465
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd really like to move forward with the installation of new equipment to settle this issue.

69
00:07:04,906 --> 00:07:07,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything we can do to move forward with this purchase order?

70
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:15,897
[SPEAKER_02]: So here we not only have the council, we not only have residents that are contacting the station manager, contacting the council.

71
00:07:16,219 --> 00:07:18,240
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure contacting the administration.

72
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:25,023
[SPEAKER_02]: And yet some four or five months later, we still are in the same position that we were five months ago.

73
00:07:25,503 --> 00:07:30,125
[SPEAKER_02]: There's money there in the cable account to attend to this very important issue.

74
00:07:31,786 --> 00:07:36,528
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would ask Mr. President, we took a vote already as a council, sent it off to the mayor.

75
00:07:37,048 --> 00:07:41,230
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would ask again that we reinforce that vote and ask that the mayor

76
00:07:42,028 --> 00:08:09,025
[SPEAKER_02]: allocate $46,765 to renew the broadcast equipment here at City Hall and to also purchase the web streaming equipment that's needed to not only view boards and commissions when they have their meeting, but also Committee of the Whole meetings and other pertinent meetings that are taking place here at City Hall that residents really should know what's going on, Mr. President.

77
00:08:09,432 --> 00:08:11,913
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a small amount to pay for transparency.

78
00:08:12,254 --> 00:08:23,080
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think that word's overused nowadays, but let me tell you, Mr. President, it's true that the lack of transparency in this community is astonishing.

79
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:30,404
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is only one aspect that we've been asking for for years to make sure that people can view these meetings.

80
00:08:31,518 --> 00:08:37,200
[SPEAKER_02]: And you see what happens when people aren't forthcoming with information and a lack of transparency.

81
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,741
[SPEAKER_02]: You see what happens in the community, Mr. President.

82
00:08:40,302 --> 00:08:44,343
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would ask that that be done in a roll call vote to the city administration.

83
00:08:45,844 --> 00:08:53,046
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll let you know that I did speak to the mayor about that, about taking the funds out of the cable account where we have money.

84
00:08:53,987 --> 00:08:56,107
[SPEAKER_05]: And she would look into it and get back to me.

85
00:08:56,127 --> 00:08:57,548
[SPEAKER_05]: That was maybe about two weeks ago.

86
00:08:57,962 --> 00:08:58,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

87
00:08:58,502 --> 00:09:01,725
[SPEAKER_02]: She's been looking into it for at least six months now and four years prior.

88
00:09:01,825 --> 00:09:03,767
[SPEAKER_05]: I did, um, I did bring that to her attention.

89
00:09:04,287 --> 00:09:05,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Longo, Kern.

90
00:09:06,169 --> 00:09:07,350
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, President Carviello.

91
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:11,453
[SPEAKER_11]: And I want to thank Council Marks for bringing this forward and placing it on the agenda again.

92
00:09:11,473 --> 00:09:19,500
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, like he mentioned, we've been discussing this and I thank Ben Brown for bringing this forward to us repeatedly over the last several months.

93
00:09:20,061 --> 00:09:25,345
[SPEAKER_11]: This is something we've been voting on and requesting for years now.

94
00:09:25,825 --> 00:09:26,406
[SPEAKER_11]: The amount of,

95
00:09:27,752 --> 00:09:40,240
[SPEAKER_11]: Email complaints I get even just during a council meeting saying, I can't hear you, it's fuzzy, you can't see your faces, it's blurry, the sound is off, the microphone's not working.

96
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,301
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, every week it's something else.

97
00:09:42,361 --> 00:09:46,063
[SPEAKER_11]: And I almost thought it was such a different issue every week.

98
00:09:46,123 --> 00:09:48,545
[SPEAKER_11]: I always thought, oh, they're just doing it on purpose.

99
00:09:48,585 --> 00:09:51,147
[SPEAKER_11]: We have such an issue on the agenda, that's why you can't hear us.

100
00:09:51,627 --> 00:09:56,490
[SPEAKER_11]: But really, the equipment, like Ben Brown says, is so old and so outdated,

101
00:09:57,672 --> 00:10:07,914
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to replace this system as we do, you know, you're trying to watch the school committee meeting that started at five and you can, I mean, that's all you see on posting on Facebook is what are they saying?

102
00:10:07,934 --> 00:10:08,595
[SPEAKER_11]: You can't hear them.

103
00:10:09,255 --> 00:10:26,719
[SPEAKER_11]: How can you have a public meeting where there's important information being discussed week after week without being able to hear the people that are speaking and the residents who are coming up with concerns and questions and the viewing public who wanna hear, who wanna know what's going on and we just don't have that.

104
00:10:27,224 --> 00:10:36,210
[SPEAKER_11]: And I thank Ben Brown for pushing the issue, because he's pushing it to the mayor and to us at the same time, rather than sitting back and saying, my hands are tied, the mayor doesn't want to do it.

105
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:38,451
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, this is something that needs to be done.

106
00:10:38,591 --> 00:10:46,116
[SPEAKER_11]: If there's funds in this account, like Councilman Mark said, that we've been taking from the ratepayers for years without cable access.

107
00:10:46,536 --> 00:10:49,658
[SPEAKER_11]: There is enough money to do the system over and do it right.

108
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:53,592
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a vote that we've taken before, and we need to take again.

109
00:10:53,692 --> 00:10:57,254
[SPEAKER_11]: It's something that really needs to get done, especially in the times that we're in.

110
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:05,178
[SPEAKER_11]: So I move a second approval, and hope my colleagues will vote in agreement, and we get this done immediately.

111
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:10,240
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't buy it that we'll look into it, that the administration will look into it.

112
00:11:10,741 --> 00:11:12,081
[SPEAKER_11]: We've been hearing that for years.

113
00:11:12,401 --> 00:11:13,162
[SPEAKER_11]: Enough is enough.

114
00:11:16,443 --> 00:11:17,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilwoman McCray.

115
00:11:18,497 --> 00:11:18,978
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

116
00:11:19,338 --> 00:11:20,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

117
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,902
[SPEAKER_04]: I really don't think there's anything to look into.

118
00:11:23,922 --> 00:11:30,128
[SPEAKER_04]: At this point in time, the council has unanimously voted on multiple occasions to upgrade the camera equipment.

119
00:11:30,469 --> 00:11:35,894
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a quote from a community media center manager that tells us what it's going to cost.

120
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:38,176
[SPEAKER_04]: They've had this quote for an extended period of time.

121
00:11:38,196 --> 00:11:39,878
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't understand what the delay is, Mr. President.

122
00:11:39,898 --> 00:11:42,781
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that being said, I support this resolution wholeheartedly.

123
00:11:43,473 --> 00:11:47,757
[SPEAKER_04]: And I look forward to seeing some fruits of our labor on this topic.

124
00:11:48,097 --> 00:11:49,618
[SPEAKER_04]: I thank the Councilor for raising the issue.

125
00:11:50,239 --> 00:11:50,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor.

126
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:52,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, Councilor Falco.

127
00:11:52,521 --> 00:11:56,864
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President, and I thank Council colleague for bringing this forward.

128
00:11:56,904 --> 00:12:00,867
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's a very important issue, especially with regards to transparency.

129
00:12:00,947 --> 00:12:05,631
[SPEAKER_12]: I know I've talked about transparency many times since I've been elected and

130
00:12:06,632 --> 00:12:12,353
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the key, one of the keys is having upgraded equipment and making sure that everything works here.

131
00:12:13,134 --> 00:12:32,438
[SPEAKER_12]: We should be making it easy for people to get involved in their community, to watch meetings, to come to meetings, to, you know, when I made the resolution for legislative software, I mean, that is a software that will fill meetings in the city council meeting room, the Richard Lee reading room.

132
00:12:33,538 --> 00:12:36,259
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, that is key for those meetings to be

133
00:12:36,986 --> 00:12:44,253
[SPEAKER_12]: taped and people can watch the boards and commission meetings and it'll help a great deal with regards to transparency.

134
00:12:44,673 --> 00:12:45,894
[SPEAKER_12]: We should be making it easier.

135
00:12:45,914 --> 00:12:49,157
[SPEAKER_12]: We should be trying to promote community engagement.

136
00:12:49,197 --> 00:12:55,122
[SPEAKER_12]: We want people to get involved and that this year will go a long way in making that happen.

137
00:12:55,242 --> 00:12:57,064
[SPEAKER_12]: So I support the resolution as well.

138
00:12:57,184 --> 00:12:57,544
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

139
00:12:57,804 --> 00:12:58,645
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you Councilor Falco.

140
00:12:59,183 --> 00:12:59,543
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening.

141
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:00,664
[SPEAKER_05]: Name and address of the record, please.

142
00:13:01,024 --> 00:13:03,065
[SPEAKER_15]: Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave.

143
00:13:03,225 --> 00:13:10,050
[SPEAKER_15]: And this is something that we have brought up years ago, starting with the finances, which I believe the city council must oversee.

144
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:15,233
[SPEAKER_15]: So the government channel money, correct me if I'm wrong, I believe it goes to three salaries at the high school.

145
00:13:16,113 --> 00:13:23,138
[SPEAKER_15]: So this money, if we recall, there was a problem with the VHS player of the city council, which was at the firehouse.

146
00:13:24,377 --> 00:13:29,361
[SPEAKER_15]: And if people didn't want to see the current council meeting, I was on your side, guys and gals.

147
00:13:30,361 --> 00:13:36,826
[SPEAKER_15]: If someone didn't want to see a council meeting, they just let the VHS tape play week after week after week.

148
00:13:37,246 --> 00:13:39,968
[SPEAKER_15]: We couldn't get, what was it, $400 we needed?

149
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,951
[SPEAKER_15]: So we finally got a DVD player.

150
00:13:44,071 --> 00:13:45,012
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow, lo and behold.

151
00:13:45,812 --> 00:13:48,754
[SPEAKER_15]: So you have to look at the finances of access.

152
00:13:48,774 --> 00:13:51,977
[SPEAKER_15]: Because what I'm afraid of is that this money will come out of the public money.

153
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:55,626
[SPEAKER_15]: Because 60% goes into the general fund.

154
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:59,950
[SPEAKER_15]: There's very few cities and towns in Massachusetts that have this dilemma.

155
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,672
[SPEAKER_15]: 60% goes into the general fund.

156
00:14:03,712 --> 00:14:05,253
[SPEAKER_15]: 20% goes to public access.

157
00:14:05,313 --> 00:14:07,095
[SPEAKER_15]: The other 20% pays for teachers.

158
00:14:07,195 --> 00:14:10,137
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe that 20% is the city council's money.

159
00:14:10,537 --> 00:14:14,259
[SPEAKER_15]: Let the teachers be paid in an appropriate way by the city.

160
00:14:14,999 --> 00:14:16,900
[SPEAKER_15]: Take that money back retroactively.

161
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:26,604
[SPEAKER_15]: Ask for a million bucks for the past five years of this money going to pay for teachers and have that pay for the city council.

162
00:14:26,684 --> 00:14:30,946
[SPEAKER_15]: Then you can do what I suggested when I taped in room 207.

163
00:14:31,446 --> 00:14:33,147
[SPEAKER_15]: And I know Councilor Falco likes this idea.

164
00:14:33,187 --> 00:14:34,708
[SPEAKER_15]: I know Michael Marks likes this idea.

165
00:14:35,548 --> 00:14:37,569
[SPEAKER_15]: I know Brianna Lumbo-Kern likes this idea.

166
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:41,826
[SPEAKER_15]: Yet three councillors said on the camera that it was creepy to do Facebook Live.

167
00:14:41,887 --> 00:14:42,227
[SPEAKER_15]: Creepy.

168
00:14:42,767 --> 00:14:43,568
[SPEAKER_15]: For transparency.

169
00:14:43,608 --> 00:14:46,711
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councillor Falco, for transparency through the chair.

170
00:14:46,751 --> 00:14:47,452
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what we need.

171
00:14:47,832 --> 00:14:49,313
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what Facebook Live does.

172
00:14:49,373 --> 00:14:53,197
[SPEAKER_15]: But why should citizens do it when we're paying for public access TV?

173
00:14:53,877 --> 00:14:55,379
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, Ben Brown is not the saviour.

174
00:14:57,981 --> 00:15:01,343
[SPEAKER_15]: Four months, we had four people on the Facebook page.

175
00:15:01,423 --> 00:15:05,865
[SPEAKER_15]: So this kid, Bob Hague is the guy at Access AV.

176
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:07,526
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been doing this since 79.

177
00:15:08,227 --> 00:15:14,310
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sure we can get the prices down even better if we have someone who's been in the game a lot longer than Mr. Brown.

178
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,251
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll do respect to him.

179
00:15:15,931 --> 00:15:18,072
[SPEAKER_15]: So yeah, we need room 207 wired.

180
00:15:18,452 --> 00:15:19,733
[SPEAKER_15]: We need to get that money back.

181
00:15:19,873 --> 00:15:25,957
[SPEAKER_15]: I want this city council to scrutinize where every nickel of the public access money is going.

182
00:15:26,757 --> 00:15:32,900
[SPEAKER_15]: and also look into the money from TV3 Medford where the newspaper had 38K they couldn't account for.

183
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,961
[SPEAKER_15]: Get that 38 grand, there's your money.

184
00:15:35,481 --> 00:15:35,901
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

185
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:36,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

186
00:15:37,602 --> 00:15:43,285
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Councilor Mox, seconded by Councilor Falco.

187
00:15:45,206 --> 00:15:46,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you recall a roll call vote?

188
00:15:48,087 --> 00:15:49,828
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Mox has requested a roll call vote.

189
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:51,089
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

190
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:55,391
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President De La Rosa.

191
00:15:55,711 --> 00:15:55,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

192
00:15:57,002 --> 00:15:57,202
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

193
00:15:57,222 --> 00:15:57,323
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

194
00:15:57,343 --> 00:15:57,443
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

195
00:16:05,884 --> 00:16:06,564
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a cameo.

196
00:16:06,705 --> 00:16:09,887
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, nine in the negative, a motion passes.

197
00:16:09,907 --> 00:16:27,057
[SPEAKER_05]: 18-098 offered by Councilor Mox, be it resolved that the Memphis School Committee immediately review and revise the Memphis Public Schools rental policy to only permit school and community-sponsored events until there is a complete public safety review.

198
00:16:27,398 --> 00:16:28,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Mox.

199
00:16:29,119 --> 00:16:34,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President, and I bring this issue up tonight, Mr. President,

200
00:16:34,987 --> 00:16:58,179
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's an issue that's been near and dear to me for several years now, and one in which I've discussed during budget times with the superintendent of schools, one in which I have debated the superintendent on, and one in which I believe firmly that in order for us to have a secure school

201
00:16:59,847 --> 00:17:05,328
[SPEAKER_02]: facility, we must revisit our facility rental agreements.

202
00:17:06,249 --> 00:17:16,811
[SPEAKER_02]: And I bring this up, Mr. President, because recently I took it one step further and took a look at the current Medford Public Schools facility rental agreement.

203
00:17:17,671 --> 00:17:19,732
[SPEAKER_02]: And I went through it with a fine-tooth comb.

204
00:17:20,417 --> 00:17:28,882
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was surprised to see a number of things, of which I am going to speak about tonight.

205
00:17:29,863 --> 00:17:38,388
[SPEAKER_02]: I think when we look at a rental agreement, although it's stated in the policy that it should be used for community services and so forth,

206
00:17:38,744 --> 00:17:40,724
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a valuable asset, which I agree.

207
00:17:41,505 --> 00:17:44,465
[SPEAKER_02]: It also states in here that it should generate revenue.

208
00:17:45,346 --> 00:17:53,928
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, revenue is a side effect of us as a community and what we do with our buildings.

209
00:17:54,508 --> 00:18:03,650
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, the security of our faculty and our students should be the number one priority over revenue, over anything that's happening in our school system.

210
00:18:04,104 --> 00:18:11,209
[SPEAKER_02]: And under this current facilities rental agreement, I don't believe it addresses security at all.

211
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:20,256
[SPEAKER_02]: And it doesn't mention at all the security of our buildings, the security of our students, or our faculty that are in these buildings, Mr. President.

212
00:18:21,057 --> 00:18:23,859
[SPEAKER_02]: If you would indulge me, I'd like to read certain sections of this.

213
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:32,105
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason why I'm doing it is, I know, I believe it was last week, the school committee voted to take a look at their policy.

214
00:18:33,088 --> 00:18:33,648
[SPEAKER_02]: on rentals.

215
00:18:34,509 --> 00:18:42,740
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't want to say I told you so, but for the past five years I've actually voted against city budgets because of this very issue.

216
00:18:43,421 --> 00:18:47,225
[SPEAKER_02]: The past five years I've had a dialogue and discussion with the superintendent

217
00:18:47,806 --> 00:19:04,253
[SPEAKER_02]: And he assured me over and over again, my colleagues were present for a lot of this, that he would indeed look into this and see if there was a shortcoming within our rental agreements and how we can improve it so that our students are safe within our buildings, that our faculty are safe.

218
00:19:05,014 --> 00:19:12,177
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm very disappointed that in my discussions recently with the superintendent, that none of this was addressed.

219
00:19:13,303 --> 00:19:15,924
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is only one part of school safety.

220
00:19:16,224 --> 00:19:22,086
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want anyone to think that if we iron this out with rentals, that now we have a safe school building.

221
00:19:22,386 --> 00:19:32,190
[SPEAKER_02]: There's policies, there's procedures, there's lockdowns, there's oversight, there's a lot else that takes place within our buildings to provide security.

222
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:36,792
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is one component, but a very important component.

223
00:19:37,832 --> 00:19:40,173
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first page of

224
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:56,393
[SPEAKER_02]: the facilities rental agreement, and by the way, this is, anyone can go on the city public school website and pull up this agreement, the Connor box just put in at the top, rental agreement, it'll pop up this particular agreement.

225
00:19:56,413 --> 00:19:57,574
[SPEAKER_02]: One information, Councilor Knight.

226
00:19:57,874 --> 00:20:04,720
[SPEAKER_04]: And I apologize for interrupting, Councilor Marks, I'm just hoping that when you're done with the document, we can have copies of it made by the city messenger for a packet this evening.

227
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:08,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, mine has personal comments on it, so I'm not gonna share mine,

228
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:11,655
[SPEAKER_02]: If you could email me the link, I'd appreciate it.

229
00:20:11,695 --> 00:20:13,075
[SPEAKER_02]: We can get this on the city website.

230
00:20:14,096 --> 00:20:17,677
[SPEAKER_02]: So at first it states, Mr. President, procedure for use of school facilities.

231
00:20:17,697 --> 00:20:26,259
[SPEAKER_02]: It says rental applications should contact community schools for facilities and the pool coordinator for the pool.

232
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:34,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Or in the case of other facilities, the secretary of the school at which the facility is located to determine if the facility is available.

233
00:20:35,654 --> 00:20:46,182
[SPEAKER_02]: Once an individual organization has determined facility availability, and has decided to proceed with the rental, the rental procedure at Medford Public Schools should be followed.

234
00:20:47,043 --> 00:20:53,287
[SPEAKER_02]: And the very first thing says, you should go and complete the facility's usage request.

235
00:20:54,248 --> 00:20:57,851
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can go right online, I printed it out, it's a two page request form.

236
00:20:58,792 --> 00:21:01,694
[SPEAKER_02]: The request form asks for a name of applicant.

237
00:21:02,422 --> 00:21:03,943
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a pretty fair question.

238
00:21:04,883 --> 00:21:12,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Name of organization, your mailing address, your phone number, your email address, the city in which you reside.

239
00:21:13,945 --> 00:21:21,167
[SPEAKER_02]: And the date requested, days of the week, the entrance time of the facility, and the exit time of the facility.

240
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:24,368
[SPEAKER_02]: The start of the activity, end of activity.

241
00:21:24,888 --> 00:21:27,089
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you just have to sign it, leave a deposit.

242
00:21:27,129 --> 00:21:30,910
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it's a 25% deposit on whatever the cost is.

243
00:21:31,731 --> 00:21:39,513
[SPEAKER_02]: And then at midway down on the page, apparently the Medford Public Schools is open for rental.

244
00:21:40,255 --> 00:21:46,221
[SPEAKER_02]: It says organizations using school facilities must adhere to the time approved.

245
00:21:46,781 --> 00:21:50,144
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it goes on to say the school requested.

246
00:21:51,005 --> 00:22:04,157
[SPEAKER_02]: So under this application, you can request to rent Meffitt High School, McGlynn Middle School, Andrews Middle School, the Brooks Elementary School, the Columbus Elementary School, and the Roberts Elementary School.

247
00:22:05,082 --> 00:22:11,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it asks you, within those particular schools, what facility would you like to have within those particular schools?

248
00:22:12,193 --> 00:22:13,735
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have the Marsha Karen Theater.

249
00:22:14,216 --> 00:22:15,758
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have Lecture Hall C2.

250
00:22:16,219 --> 00:22:17,501
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have the McGlynn Theater.

251
00:22:17,842 --> 00:22:18,863
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have MHS Foyer.

252
00:22:19,774 --> 00:22:21,435
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have Lecture Hall C3.

253
00:22:21,895 --> 00:22:45,988
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have classrooms, Library Media Center, Brooks Elementary Gym, Columbus Elementary Gym, McGlynn Gym, Andrews Gym, Roberts Gym, Medford High Gym, Andrews Middle School Cafeteria, Batting Cages, Pool, MHS Cafeteria, Lecture Halls, Batting Cages, Edgeley Field, La Conte Rink,

254
00:22:46,568 --> 00:22:48,411
[SPEAKER_02]: In other, you can put in other.

255
00:22:48,931 --> 00:22:51,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you can write, I'd like to rent the mayor's office.

256
00:22:52,316 --> 00:22:53,337
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, it says other.

257
00:22:53,598 --> 00:22:58,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that's, so you can request whatever you want to rent in this community.

258
00:22:59,806 --> 00:23:02,289
[SPEAKER_02]: The next section is equipment services needed.

259
00:23:02,309 --> 00:23:04,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you need a custodian?

260
00:23:04,912 --> 00:23:05,592
[SPEAKER_02]: you check it off.

261
00:23:06,233 --> 00:23:08,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Food service, you would check it off if you need it.

262
00:23:08,974 --> 00:23:10,715
[SPEAKER_02]: A house manager, you would check it off.

263
00:23:11,275 --> 00:23:16,317
[SPEAKER_02]: Theater technician, a microphone, overhead projector, video, LCD.

264
00:23:17,478 --> 00:23:20,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Not one question about security.

265
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:22,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Not one question.

266
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:27,222
[SPEAKER_02]: And in my opinion, it shouldn't be a question, Mr. President,

267
00:23:27,888 --> 00:23:51,654
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be mandatory that if you're renting out public schools, that Meffitt Public Schools provides the security on behalf of our community to safeguard our building that we have millions of dollars invested in, and also on behalf of students and faculty that have to attend these buildings the day after we have people from outside the community using our facility.

268
00:23:52,414 --> 00:23:53,354
[SPEAKER_02]: It only makes sense.

269
00:23:54,553 --> 00:23:58,216
[SPEAKER_02]: It also should be a requirement to have a supervisor.

270
00:23:58,776 --> 00:24:13,747
[SPEAKER_02]: And as I go on to the next page of this, it should be mandatory that the Medford Public Schools says not only will you be required to have security, but you also will be required to have a supervisor that'll be supervising the event that's going on.

271
00:24:14,248 --> 00:24:23,054
[SPEAKER_02]: Making sure that you adhere to the rules and the standards and the building codes and the capacity requirements that a community has.

272
00:24:23,975 --> 00:24:25,076
[SPEAKER_02]: None of that takes place.

273
00:24:25,716 --> 00:24:28,918
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's the first shortfall within renting our buildings.

274
00:24:29,538 --> 00:24:31,399
[SPEAKER_02]: No security requirement.

275
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,801
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be mandatory, Mr. President.

276
00:24:37,677 --> 00:25:03,102
[SPEAKER_02]: The next part of this, it also states, and this is back to the procedure for use of the school facilities, says the building principal and where applicable, the fine arts media director or designee, athletic director for fields and gyms, food service director will review and sign the application for the rental of the facility for the purpose stated and then forward it to the superintendent for final approval.

277
00:25:04,383 --> 00:25:05,743
[SPEAKER_02]: Not one sign off

278
00:25:07,647 --> 00:25:10,669
[SPEAKER_02]: by security, not one sign off.

279
00:25:10,969 --> 00:25:14,572
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you not include security in this day and age?

280
00:25:14,892 --> 00:25:16,894
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you not safeguard our buildings?

281
00:25:17,934 --> 00:25:19,135
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you not mention that?

282
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:21,417
[SPEAKER_02]: How is that not a requirement?

283
00:25:21,757 --> 00:25:28,202
[SPEAKER_02]: When I go to the principal, the principal says, yeah, it's available on the 30th, that Friday, you can use the building.

284
00:25:28,502 --> 00:25:29,483
[SPEAKER_02]: And he signs off.

285
00:25:30,924 --> 00:25:33,346
[SPEAKER_02]: The next step should be, it goes to security.

286
00:25:34,782 --> 00:25:37,443
[SPEAKER_02]: whether it's Chief Sackle or the head of security at Medford High School.

287
00:25:38,263 --> 00:25:45,126
[SPEAKER_02]: And they should sign off and see what the number of people are required, what they're doing in the event, what does the event call for?

288
00:25:45,826 --> 00:25:48,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it need more than one security personnel?

289
00:25:48,287 --> 00:25:50,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it need more than one supervisors?

290
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:57,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Another omission in this particular rental agreement, Mr. President, a very alarming omission.

291
00:26:01,151 --> 00:26:02,192
[SPEAKER_02]: The conditions of use.

292
00:26:03,802 --> 00:26:25,047
[SPEAKER_02]: All users shall agree to hold the Meffitt Public Schools, the city of Meffitt, the Meffitt School Committee, the superintendent of schools, their agents, officers, and employees harmless for all property damage or personal injury, including death resulting from the negligence of users relating to the use of the facilities, grounds, equipment, or furniture.

293
00:26:27,148 --> 00:26:28,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing about our students.

294
00:26:30,929 --> 00:26:32,249
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing about our faculty.

295
00:26:33,253 --> 00:26:38,140
[SPEAKER_02]: They're saying, if something happens in that building, you're not going to hold the superintendent liable.

296
00:26:38,881 --> 00:26:42,206
[SPEAKER_02]: God forbid, you ain't going to hold him liable, even though he signs off on it.

297
00:26:42,646 --> 00:26:45,671
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to hold the school committee, who's responsible for this liable.

298
00:26:46,928 --> 00:27:16,491
[SPEAKER_02]: So who do we hold responsible when we allow a 21-year-old, because that's what the agreement says, you can rent if you're 21, a 21-year-old to come in and rent to any one of our buildings, invite hundreds of people, and that's not a fabrication, it currently takes place now, hundreds of people with no ID, no quarry check, we don't know what purpose other than what's stated on the form they're there for, we don't know what they're leaving behind in these schools,

299
00:27:19,312 --> 00:27:23,614
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't have any security personnel to oversee this.

300
00:27:26,756 --> 00:27:31,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, renters must be 21 years age or older to rent a school facility.

301
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:33,720
[SPEAKER_02]: No quarry check is required.

302
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,081
[SPEAKER_02]: Another omission.

303
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:43,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, Mr. President, if I want to go up and put a local access show on Community Access, they quarry check me.

304
00:27:44,886 --> 00:27:47,148
[SPEAKER_02]: If I want to go rent the McGlynn School,

305
00:27:49,123 --> 00:27:53,424
[SPEAKER_02]: No quarry check, no security, and I can rent that building until I'm blue in the face.

306
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:59,426
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can invite whoever I want into that building and have access to all sections of that building.

307
00:28:01,207 --> 00:28:02,387
[SPEAKER_02]: How is that security?

308
00:28:04,287 --> 00:28:06,728
[SPEAKER_02]: We recently did a sweep because what took place?

309
00:28:08,809 --> 00:28:12,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we going to do a sweep every weekend after these renters are gone?

310
00:28:16,737 --> 00:28:17,877
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't make sense.

311
00:28:17,937 --> 00:28:22,839
[SPEAKER_02]: The policy doesn't come from a standpoint of public safety and security.

312
00:28:23,459 --> 00:28:26,881
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes strictly from a financial standpoint.

313
00:28:29,141 --> 00:28:31,062
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're not that hot up as a community.

314
00:28:33,483 --> 00:28:35,323
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't need it, Mr. President.

315
00:28:37,124 --> 00:28:42,486
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't need the additional burden, aggravation, and security concerns throughout the entire community.

316
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:46,667
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to hold a city event, fine.

317
00:28:47,107 --> 00:28:48,148
[SPEAKER_02]: Sponsored by the city.

318
00:28:48,168 --> 00:28:51,130
[SPEAKER_02]: If the schools want to put on an event, that's fine in their building.

319
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:52,931
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not talking about school events.

320
00:28:53,211 --> 00:28:58,035
[SPEAKER_02]: The superintendent was here two weeks ago or a week ago, and he said, well, what about the Cub Scouts?

321
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:04,065
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, come on, Mr. Superintendent, we're not talking about the Cub Scouts in the community.

322
00:29:04,505 --> 00:29:13,270
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about renting our buildings to organizations or groups or individuals that we know nothing about.

323
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:19,893
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know what their intent is, we don't know what their purpose is, and we can't control them under this current agreement.

324
00:29:23,915 --> 00:29:25,396
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes on to say, Mr. President,

325
00:29:26,577 --> 00:29:36,945
[SPEAKER_02]: The user may not allow attendance at any event to exceed the rated capacity at a method facility as determined by the applicable fire and safety codes.

326
00:29:38,046 --> 00:29:39,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Where is that in the policy?

327
00:29:41,349 --> 00:29:42,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Where is it asking for the application?

328
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:43,891
[SPEAKER_02]: I just showed you that.

329
00:29:44,131 --> 00:29:45,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Where is it asking to put a number?

330
00:29:45,712 --> 00:29:46,813
[SPEAKER_02]: How many people will be here?

331
00:29:47,093 --> 00:29:47,694
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see it.

332
00:29:50,236 --> 00:29:51,597
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's just language in there.

333
00:29:51,997 --> 00:29:52,818
[SPEAKER_02]: It's meaningless.

334
00:29:57,306 --> 00:30:09,030
[SPEAKER_02]: The sponsoring organization must take responsibility for ensuring that only the facility noted on the application are used and that the remaining parts of the building are not entered.

335
00:30:11,411 --> 00:30:13,892
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like giving the fox the key to the chicken coop.

336
00:30:15,932 --> 00:30:16,793
[SPEAKER_02]: Here you are, renter.

337
00:30:17,133 --> 00:30:18,493
[SPEAKER_02]: You're only supposed to be in the cages.

338
00:30:19,453 --> 00:30:20,274
[SPEAKER_02]: No one watching you.

339
00:30:20,574 --> 00:30:22,054
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't go in any parts of the building.

340
00:30:22,334 --> 00:30:24,155
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not allowed anywhere else in that building.

341
00:30:24,835 --> 00:30:26,996
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to hold you responsible, Mr. Renter.

342
00:30:28,953 --> 00:30:29,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes no sense.

343
00:30:30,253 --> 00:30:32,434
[SPEAKER_02]: This is when we need security up there.

344
00:30:32,694 --> 00:30:41,457
[SPEAKER_02]: This is when we need a supervisor up there to monitor our facilities and making sure they're maintained in a safe and adequate fashion, Mr. President.

345
00:30:42,777 --> 00:30:47,839
[SPEAKER_02]: No individual will be admitted to the school building before the arrival of an adult supervisor.

346
00:30:48,819 --> 00:30:52,680
[SPEAKER_02]: So until that 21-year-old gets there, no one's going to be admitted.

347
00:30:55,002 --> 00:31:01,304
[SPEAKER_02]: who must be at least 21 years of age, and no individual may remain in the building without such supervisor.

348
00:31:01,865 --> 00:31:04,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Putting a lot of emphasis on these renters.

349
00:31:04,726 --> 00:31:06,867
[SPEAKER_02]: These renters are now self-policing.

350
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:09,208
[SPEAKER_02]: They're responsible now for everything.

351
00:31:11,008 --> 00:31:15,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Custodians have been given special instruction to enforce regulations strictly.

352
00:31:17,691 --> 00:31:20,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Another responsibility for our custodians.

353
00:31:21,391 --> 00:31:25,692
[SPEAKER_02]: The superintendent said that he used them to sweep areas for bombs at the high school.

354
00:31:26,693 --> 00:31:35,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we have them overseeing all our facilities to make sure there's adequate people responsible that should be there for the building itself.

355
00:31:38,796 --> 00:31:43,218
[SPEAKER_02]: The applicant will be responsible for all attendees involved in the function, i.e.

356
00:31:43,478 --> 00:31:49,479
[SPEAKER_02]: participants, observers, and anyone who enters the building when it is under the control of the applicant.

357
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,080
[SPEAKER_02]: He's solely responsible.

358
00:31:52,720 --> 00:32:02,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Any given Saturday, you can go up to high school, and there's events up there, not gonna mention names, that have 600 or so people that attend the event.

359
00:32:02,827 --> 00:32:06,389
[SPEAKER_02]: It's well attended, and it's been going on for years, and it's a great event.

360
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:11,112
[SPEAKER_02]: But there is no supervision other than this group.

361
00:32:12,556 --> 00:32:13,877
[SPEAKER_02]: They supervise themselves.

362
00:32:14,477 --> 00:32:16,017
[SPEAKER_02]: They have access to every classroom.

363
00:32:16,538 --> 00:32:23,921
[SPEAKER_02]: They have access to the cafeteria, the intercom system, all the lecture halls, you name it, they have access to it.

364
00:32:24,321 --> 00:32:26,682
[SPEAKER_02]: They even have rooms under their own lock and key.

365
00:32:27,462 --> 00:32:28,723
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how big the high school is.

366
00:32:29,123 --> 00:32:30,824
[SPEAKER_02]: They will give them a dedicated room.

367
00:32:31,224 --> 00:32:34,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, you can store stuff in this particular room at the high school.

368
00:32:34,885 --> 00:32:36,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Meffitt High School.

369
00:32:36,786 --> 00:32:39,007
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do anything we can to keep you as a renter.

370
00:32:40,747 --> 00:32:42,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Security need not apply.

371
00:32:42,448 --> 00:32:50,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it goes on to say, the custodial staff shall have no responsibility.

372
00:32:51,053 --> 00:32:55,356
[SPEAKER_02]: So before they had a responsibility to make sure that someone was 21 that was there present.

373
00:32:55,836 --> 00:33:06,803
[SPEAKER_02]: The custodial staff shall have no responsibility to the user group beyond coordinating access and assisting in the location of electrical outlets and light switches.

374
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:09,626
[SPEAKER_02]: No other responsibilities.

375
00:33:10,366 --> 00:33:19,609
[SPEAKER_02]: So if the superintendent says, well, they're the eyes and ears when we have a function, and they're out there to make sure things are happening, not according to this policy, they have no responsibilities.

376
00:33:20,829 --> 00:33:28,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Those who use school facilities must actively supervise all participants and attendees and enforce this rule.

377
00:33:29,771 --> 00:33:33,112
[SPEAKER_02]: They're responsible, the renter, for enforcing the rule.

378
00:33:35,142 --> 00:33:37,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't sound like a safe environment to me, Mr. President.

379
00:33:38,104 --> 00:33:48,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't sound like a place that I would feel comfortable after using to allow our children, Mr. President, to go back into these buildings, knowing that we don't know what was brought into these buildings.

380
00:33:49,632 --> 00:33:50,793
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know what was left behind.

381
00:33:51,133 --> 00:33:58,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe something was mistakenly left behind that could cause injury to a first grader, a second grader, a third grader.

382
00:33:58,838 --> 00:33:59,438
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know.

383
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,861
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll never know under this current policy.

384
00:34:05,493 --> 00:34:30,633
[SPEAKER_02]: I would ask, Mr. President, that my resolution, which states that the Meffitt School Committee immediately review and revise the policy to the Meffitt Public Schools rental to only permit school and community sponsored events until there is a complete safety review, also be amended to include mandatory security personnel and school building supervisors to be present at all Meffitt Public School facility rentals.

385
00:34:31,939 --> 00:34:49,191
[SPEAKER_02]: And at that point, Mr. President, I would hope that the school committee does their due diligence and homework to make sure that we don't have to worry when a building's rented on a Saturday or a Sunday, that when our students show up on a Monday, that that building is secure.

386
00:34:49,211 --> 00:34:56,697
[SPEAKER_02]: And as far as I'm concerned, and this may sound like a hard approach, I don't think we should be renting our buildings.

387
00:34:57,907 --> 00:35:00,508
[SPEAKER_02]: I really don't think we should be renting our school facilities.

388
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:05,630
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to rent the pool at the high school or the gymnasium, they have security up there.

389
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:08,731
[SPEAKER_02]: They have someone that's in the front that acts as a supervisor.

390
00:35:08,991 --> 00:35:11,052
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a community schools concept.

391
00:35:12,053 --> 00:35:13,353
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all in favor of that.

392
00:35:13,953 --> 00:35:23,797
[SPEAKER_02]: But to wholesale rent all our facilities without the proper supervision and security, I think we're setting ourselves up, Mr. President, for a disaster to happen.

393
00:35:24,137 --> 00:35:25,958
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not going to wait for that to happen.

394
00:35:27,435 --> 00:35:28,435
[SPEAKER_02]: I thank you, Mr. President.

395
00:35:29,075 --> 00:35:30,076
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Council Mars.

396
00:35:30,096 --> 00:35:30,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Council Member Kern.

397
00:35:32,116 --> 00:35:33,977
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, President Carviello.

398
00:35:34,317 --> 00:35:37,858
[SPEAKER_11]: I agree with the resolution.

399
00:35:37,898 --> 00:35:41,818
[SPEAKER_11]: I just, number one, want to know what the amendments are again.

400
00:35:41,879 --> 00:35:43,699
[SPEAKER_11]: I think you said that it'd be mandatory.

401
00:35:43,819 --> 00:35:49,500
[SPEAKER_11]: You were requesting that they require mandatory school personnel be in attendance during the functions.

402
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,641
[SPEAKER_11]: And what was the other amendment?

403
00:35:52,801 --> 00:35:56,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Mandatory personnel and supervisors be present.

404
00:36:05,344 --> 00:36:22,353
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I think this is one this issue is definitely one of the probably 10 to 20 issues that need to Be discussed I think I agree with you comes much you have brought this up in the past and I remember you clearly you go and head-to-head with our superintendent about this and

405
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:26,922
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, it's something that should have already been put in place with regards to security.

406
00:36:26,982 --> 00:36:33,405
[SPEAKER_11]: It's good that you got your hands on that, um, agreement and hopefully you will share that with us so that we could take a look at it.

407
00:36:33,445 --> 00:36:42,650
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think you said enough when you mentioned the highlights from the agreement and the fact that no security can be, is required within that agreement.

408
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:44,771
[SPEAKER_11]: And that, that is, that is a little scary to me.

409
00:36:44,791 --> 00:36:48,153
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, just a point of information.

410
00:36:48,213 --> 00:36:48,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Marks.

411
00:36:49,542 --> 00:36:53,426
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to let it be known that this document is available on the school website.

412
00:36:54,147 --> 00:36:55,769
[SPEAKER_02]: So it'd be like going on the City of Medford website.

413
00:36:56,109 --> 00:36:59,834
[SPEAKER_02]: This is available for anyone to look at, not only this council, anyone in the community.

414
00:37:00,354 --> 00:37:06,221
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want people to know that that's out there, and it's as easy as clicking on their website to get a copy of it.

415
00:37:06,241 --> 00:37:06,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

416
00:37:06,942 --> 00:37:07,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Martins.

417
00:37:08,695 --> 00:37:09,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Council Member Craig.

418
00:37:09,395 --> 00:37:09,675
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

419
00:37:09,715 --> 00:37:13,016
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think this is definitely something that I am in support of.

420
00:37:13,096 --> 00:37:27,461
[SPEAKER_11]: And I ask that the school committee do review that policy and make the necessary changes and do what they have to do to ensure our children's safety and anybody that enters those buildings' safety on a number of levels, including this one.

421
00:37:28,101 --> 00:37:36,864
[SPEAKER_11]: I just don't want to mislead the public in thinking with regards to, I think, what some of the admins want

422
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:46,454
[SPEAKER_11]: the public to believe is that a group was in this McGlynn school and left a magazine clip in one of our buildings at the McGlynn.

423
00:37:47,895 --> 00:37:58,201
[SPEAKER_11]: And because that magazine clip was thrown away in the trash barrel is the reason why we really may never know where that came from.

424
00:37:59,522 --> 00:38:03,624
[SPEAKER_11]: That is what I just don't, this is something that definitely needs to be looked at.

425
00:38:03,844 --> 00:38:06,386
[SPEAKER_11]: So don't 10 to 20 things within the next week or two

426
00:38:06,802 --> 00:38:31,671
[SPEAKER_11]: And so don't a hundred other things need to be looked at within the next couple months because we obviously need revamping in all our policies and procedures, all our contracts with, I mean, just, there are a whole host of issues that we've obviously have discovered problems with, but I don't want anybody to believe that whatever group rents that school was the reason for what was found.

427
00:38:31,831 --> 00:38:32,691
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't know that.

428
00:38:33,667 --> 00:38:37,750
[SPEAKER_11]: And we may never know that because it was hidden and covered up for so long.

429
00:38:38,751 --> 00:38:44,835
[SPEAKER_11]: And that, to me, is the root of the entire problem for everybody that knew.

430
00:38:44,855 --> 00:38:49,438
[SPEAKER_11]: And we will probably never know where that came from.

431
00:38:49,539 --> 00:38:51,880
[SPEAKER_11]: So I want to make sure I made that point.

432
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,422
[SPEAKER_11]: At the same time, I know this needs to be reviewed.

433
00:38:55,443 --> 00:38:57,825
[SPEAKER_11]: What was spoken of is a little bit disturbing.

434
00:38:57,845 --> 00:39:00,927
[SPEAKER_11]: And it definitely needs to be revamped.

435
00:39:01,494 --> 00:39:06,919
[SPEAKER_11]: looked into whether or not we even rent our facilities is definitely a question the school committee needs to decide.

436
00:39:07,319 --> 00:39:12,204
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure we'll be there to help and give our opinions when the time comes during those discussions.

437
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:17,748
[SPEAKER_11]: But the concerning part to me is that because that was thrown away, we can't get fingerprints.

438
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:22,192
[SPEAKER_11]: We can't look and see if there's any serial number.

439
00:39:22,212 --> 00:39:24,655
[SPEAKER_11]: We just don't have enough.

440
00:39:24,815 --> 00:39:26,716
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's really the scary part.

441
00:39:27,057 --> 00:39:27,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

442
00:39:28,496 --> 00:39:30,039
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion by Councillor Marks.

443
00:39:30,059 --> 00:39:30,620
[SPEAKER_04]: Councillor Knight.

444
00:39:31,041 --> 00:39:34,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, I'd like to be recorded in opposition to the resolution.

445
00:39:34,227 --> 00:39:41,020
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason being last week the school committee did vote to examine their rental policies and I feel as though they should be provided the opportunity to do that.

446
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,302
[SPEAKER_04]: I certainly respect Councillor Marks for bringing the issue forward, and I can certainly understand why he did.

447
00:39:45,902 --> 00:39:52,326
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I feel as though our school committee has been elected to perform a function, and that's to set policy in our public schools, and this is an issue of public policy.

448
00:39:53,006 --> 00:40:01,510
[SPEAKER_04]: There is an ongoing investigation, as Councillor Lungo had spoke to, and I think we need to let our colleagues on the school committee do their job, Mr. President, so for that reason, it has to be recorded in opposition.

449
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:02,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councillor Layton.

450
00:40:03,071 --> 00:40:04,552
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Councillor Marks.

451
00:40:06,291 --> 00:40:06,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks.

452
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:08,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

453
00:40:08,793 --> 00:40:15,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, my, my resolution, uh, does not say that the city council will craft a new request form.

454
00:40:16,161 --> 00:40:20,004
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't say it'll craft a new facilities rental agreement.

455
00:40:20,405 --> 00:40:22,947
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't say the school committee must do this.

456
00:40:23,027 --> 00:40:23,968
[SPEAKER_02]: It must do that.

457
00:40:24,409 --> 00:40:27,412
[SPEAKER_02]: We're making a recommendation as elected officials.

458
00:40:28,083 --> 00:40:42,656
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have every right as a concerned, not only elected official, but as a concerned parent and a resident in this community to make sure that our wishes are also carried out, Mr. President, and our concerns are carried out.

459
00:40:43,177 --> 00:40:48,041
[SPEAKER_02]: So by no means is this usurping of the school committee's authority.

460
00:40:48,742 --> 00:40:52,045
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great that they waited for something to happen, and now they're acting.

461
00:40:52,906 --> 00:40:59,570
[SPEAKER_02]: I brought this issue up for the last four years to the superintendent, to the school committee, publicly at this meeting, and it fell on deaf ears.

462
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:00,790
[SPEAKER_02]: And now they're acting.

463
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:02,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Great for the school committee.

464
00:41:02,631 --> 00:41:03,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Great for the mayor.

465
00:41:03,412 --> 00:41:04,132
[SPEAKER_02]: They're acting now.

466
00:41:06,113 --> 00:41:18,820
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't believe, Mr. President, that for us, we should be able to give guidance and our input on what we believe needs to take place.

467
00:41:19,721 --> 00:41:21,161
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I did tonight, Mr. President.

468
00:41:23,052 --> 00:41:29,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, just in my reading of the resolution, be it resolved the Medford School Committee immediately review and revise the Medford Public Schools rental policy.

469
00:41:30,297 --> 00:41:31,518
[SPEAKER_04]: That's already been voted on.

470
00:41:31,538 --> 00:41:32,478
[SPEAKER_04]: They are going to do that, right?

471
00:41:32,919 --> 00:41:33,959
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll take that language out.

472
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:38,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it resolved the Medford School Committee immediately only permit school and community sponsored events.

473
00:41:39,463 --> 00:41:40,003
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it says.

474
00:41:40,023 --> 00:41:42,264
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a directive more than a suggestion to me, Mr. President.

475
00:41:42,524 --> 00:41:45,805
[SPEAKER_04]: With that being said, I have no problem with the gentleman bringing the matter forward.

476
00:41:45,925 --> 00:41:49,245
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm in opposition to it for a theoretical reason, not for any other reason more.

477
00:41:49,706 --> 00:41:51,266
[SPEAKER_04]: The school committee implements policy.

478
00:41:51,626 --> 00:41:52,706
[SPEAKER_04]: The school committee makes policy.

479
00:41:52,746 --> 00:41:55,447
[SPEAKER_04]: The superintendent's in charge of executing that policy, Mr. President.

480
00:41:56,047 --> 00:41:59,828
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we should let the school committee have an opportunity to do their job and do what they need to do.

481
00:42:00,308 --> 00:42:01,388
[SPEAKER_04]: And I rest my case at that.

482
00:42:02,309 --> 00:42:02,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Counsel Box.

483
00:42:04,029 --> 00:42:07,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, the council's been on the council for a few years.

484
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:11,345
[SPEAKER_02]: He knows much of what we say up here are recommendations.

485
00:42:11,887 --> 00:42:12,829
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's all that is.

486
00:42:12,889 --> 00:42:15,637
[SPEAKER_02]: So he can go based on any wording he believes.

487
00:42:16,313 --> 00:42:27,900
[SPEAKER_02]: But I could just tell you when I went head-to-head with the superintendent and voted against budgets, I wish I had that same support of some of the members of this council before anything happened, Mr. President, not after the fact.

488
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:39,587
[SPEAKER_02]: So to make a recommendation tonight to improve security in our schools is well under the purview of this council, and it's a recommendation, and that's all it is, is a recommendation, Mr. President.

489
00:42:39,707 --> 00:42:40,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

490
00:42:40,863 --> 00:42:41,643
[SPEAKER_11]: Council Member Kern.

491
00:42:42,064 --> 00:42:42,344
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

492
00:42:42,384 --> 00:42:51,267
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think it's important to point out that the resolution states that only permits school and community-sponsored events.

493
00:42:51,708 --> 00:42:56,430
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the wording, until there is a complete public safety review, is important.

494
00:42:56,530 --> 00:43:02,993
[SPEAKER_11]: Because, yes, whoever rented that school or rents our facilities,

495
00:43:04,416 --> 00:43:08,097
[SPEAKER_11]: they are being subject to, could it have been them?

496
00:43:08,217 --> 00:43:13,018
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, they are being subject to that, what unfortunately is taking place.

497
00:43:14,138 --> 00:43:15,898
[SPEAKER_04]: What if information comes tonight?

498
00:43:15,958 --> 00:43:18,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Quite frankly, it could have been anybody that has access to the school.

499
00:43:18,699 --> 00:43:19,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody that has a key to the school.

500
00:43:19,799 --> 00:43:21,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody that's an employee to the school.

501
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:22,179
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be anybody.

502
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:22,839
[SPEAKER_04]: And we don't know.

503
00:43:22,899 --> 00:43:24,420
[SPEAKER_04]: And the council is absolutely correct about that.

504
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:26,380
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why there is an investigation that's pending.

505
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:29,541
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we have the information that we need to proceed, we will.

506
00:43:30,141 --> 00:43:30,961
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's not even we.

507
00:43:31,041 --> 00:43:31,721
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the school committee.

508
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:46,307
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think until we have the investigation, which I believe the chief said last Tuesday it was going to take one to two weeks, I think until then, if it's only going to be one more week, then I agree wholeheartedly with you, Counselor Marks, that nobody should be in our schools.

509
00:43:46,827 --> 00:43:47,168
[SPEAKER_11]: Nobody.

510
00:43:47,188 --> 00:44:01,692
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, parents were emailing and calling me today because the high school was left unlocked between 7 and 7 42, which is when I believe our Medford Police Department stationed there and were there for the day.

511
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:11,232
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, my children's school at the Roberts, they were there from when the doors opened until, I mean, I left far after school closed, and our Medford Police Department was still there.

512
00:44:11,692 --> 00:44:14,633
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're getting complaints just for the school being open.

513
00:44:14,973 --> 00:44:26,876
[SPEAKER_11]: So I wholeheartedly believe, and unfortunately the case is we don't know where it came from, so until, which is probably one more week, until we have the results of that investigation, nobody should be in our facilities.

514
00:44:28,477 --> 00:44:28,777
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

515
00:44:30,351 --> 00:44:31,472
[SPEAKER_16]: Name and address of the record, please.

516
00:44:31,753 --> 00:44:35,097
[SPEAKER_16]: Robert M. Pentez, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., former member of this party.

517
00:44:35,557 --> 00:44:45,148
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, the world is in a changing state of times right now, and I think what Councilman Marks has introduced is something that could be epidemic anywhere in this country, but it's not the first time.

518
00:44:45,229 --> 00:44:46,150
[SPEAKER_16]: It's been here before.

519
00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:51,212
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, you as counselors, you have a 50 percent voice in the school department budget.

520
00:44:51,653 --> 00:45:00,677
[SPEAKER_16]: And if you see something that's not taking place in their budget, for example, under school security, and here's a prime example of what school security is all about, this is the opportunity to do it.

521
00:45:01,057 --> 00:45:07,240
[SPEAKER_16]: If the school committee knows that the city council is with them and trying to help them, that's a great leadership quality.

522
00:45:07,501 --> 00:45:11,983
[SPEAKER_16]: And I don't think anybody in any municipal or state or federal capacity should sit back.

523
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:14,264
[SPEAKER_16]: If you've got something to say that revolves around security,

524
00:45:14,683 --> 00:45:14,963
[SPEAKER_16]: Say it.

525
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:16,123
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what you're getting paid for.

526
00:45:16,423 --> 00:45:17,824
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what the people expect from you.

527
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:30,126
[SPEAKER_16]: With that being said, Mr. President, not only do I think it's a good movement, I think it would be wise, as a suggestion being offered to the school committee, that they review their entire policy.

528
00:45:30,526 --> 00:45:42,348
[SPEAKER_16]: And now, knowing that they're going to be having a new superintendent as of June or at the end of May or whatever it might be, if not sooner, whatever the situation might be, here's an opportunity to start to clean house on issues that are really of a concern.

529
00:45:43,352 --> 00:45:45,232
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe the gun clip said something.

530
00:45:46,053 --> 00:45:49,033
[SPEAKER_16]: But the review of the policy is what it's all about.

531
00:45:49,533 --> 00:45:52,214
[SPEAKER_16]: People in the building that nobody knows nothing about.

532
00:45:52,234 --> 00:45:54,315
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think it's a good motion.

533
00:45:54,755 --> 00:45:56,395
[SPEAKER_16]: And I would hope the council votes approval.

534
00:45:56,615 --> 00:45:56,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

535
00:45:59,216 --> 00:45:59,676
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening.

536
00:45:59,716 --> 00:46:00,996
[SPEAKER_05]: Name and address of the record, please.

537
00:46:01,376 --> 00:46:01,976
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, good evening.

538
00:46:02,016 --> 00:46:03,757
[SPEAKER_01]: Gene Nuzzo, 35 Paris Street.

539
00:46:04,557 --> 00:46:05,957
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you'll give me a little leeway.

540
00:46:05,997 --> 00:46:08,538
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just catching up on the happenings and I have some thoughts.

541
00:46:09,245 --> 00:46:14,927
[SPEAKER_01]: And a few of the points that I wanted to make have been brought up in this particular topic, so hopefully you'll give me just a little bit of latitude.

542
00:46:16,727 --> 00:46:22,089
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to talk about leadership, because I think it's crucial in dealing with this issue.

543
00:46:22,749 --> 00:46:28,491
[SPEAKER_01]: And leadership involves establishing a clear vision and sharing that vision with others so they'll follow willingly.

544
00:46:29,231 --> 00:46:35,373
[SPEAKER_01]: It's providing the information, knowledge, and methods to realize the vision, and it's coordinating, balancing,

545
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:38,502
[SPEAKER_01]: conflicting interests of all the members and stakeholders.

546
00:46:39,322 --> 00:46:45,225
[SPEAKER_01]: A leader steps up in times of crisis and is able to think and act in a creative way during difficult times.

547
00:46:46,646 --> 00:46:51,209
[SPEAKER_01]: And transparency is also crucial in this particular instance.

548
00:46:51,849 --> 00:46:54,951
[SPEAKER_01]: And transparency is a lack of hidden agendas and conditions.

549
00:46:55,631 --> 00:47:04,096
[SPEAKER_01]: It's accompanied by the availability of full information required for collaboration, cooperation, and collective decision making.

550
00:47:05,006 --> 00:47:15,212
[SPEAKER_01]: A minimum degree of disclosure is required when making agreements and dealings and practices for transactions to assure everything is open and available.

551
00:47:15,913 --> 00:47:27,920
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are essential conditions for a free and open exchange for the rules and reasons behind measures to be sure that they're fair, clear, and concise to all participants.

552
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:31,722
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're not mutually exclusive.

553
00:47:32,253 --> 00:47:40,097
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like the events that we have been going through in the city of Medford in these past several days and what I've seen on highlight reels.

554
00:47:40,917 --> 00:47:42,198
[SPEAKER_05]: We're talking about the rental policy.

555
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:47,880
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand, but I'm tying, I'm tying into making your point of the rental.

556
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,741
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it all ties together, right?

557
00:47:50,121 --> 00:47:58,425
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a lot of people who have high emotions and everybody's cherry picking different positions and items and thoughts.

558
00:47:59,218 --> 00:48:13,066
[SPEAKER_01]: And while I don't have children in the school system, I think that brings a very different perspective to what's going on, and I'm sharing that with you because I think it comes into play, because this is one component, right?

559
00:48:14,227 --> 00:48:23,752
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a larger issue at play here, and that is that someone, regardless of who it is, and to Brianna's point, we may never know because

560
00:48:24,650 --> 00:48:26,231
[SPEAKER_01]: the item has been disposed of.

561
00:48:26,251 --> 00:48:28,393
[SPEAKER_05]: We're talking about the rental of the school.

562
00:48:28,453 --> 00:48:30,094
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying.

563
00:48:31,515 --> 00:48:32,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

564
00:48:33,516 --> 00:48:34,537
[SPEAKER_11]: When would you like her to speak?

565
00:48:34,557 --> 00:48:38,219
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause if you have a speech prepared, I have a speaking point.

566
00:48:38,259 --> 00:48:42,442
[SPEAKER_05]: If you could get back to the rental fee, we're not talking about what was found in school.

567
00:48:42,722 --> 00:48:45,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Council marks is brought up for revising the policy of the schools.

568
00:48:46,064 --> 00:48:49,867
[SPEAKER_01]: But his point was that it was found in the school because there was a rental component.

569
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:51,628
[SPEAKER_11]: I just like, would like to take a vote to allow her to,

570
00:48:51,961 --> 00:48:55,282
[SPEAKER_11]: of reader speech, or if you want her to move till the end of the meeting, then.

571
00:48:55,903 --> 00:48:57,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

572
00:48:58,344 --> 00:48:59,784
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want me to do it at the end, or can I?

573
00:48:59,944 --> 00:49:03,206
[SPEAKER_05]: Continue, but again, try to get to the rest of the story.

574
00:49:03,386 --> 00:49:14,310
[SPEAKER_01]: So while I recognize the issue, my greatest concern is not in the response and how the decision was made, but that the item was able to be brought into the school.

575
00:49:14,990 --> 00:49:18,772
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a component of it is the rental.

576
00:49:19,292 --> 00:49:21,693
[SPEAKER_01]: But the fact is that someone, we don't know who,

577
00:49:22,103 --> 00:49:23,724
[SPEAKER_01]: brought that weapon in in the first place.

578
00:49:24,405 --> 00:49:28,668
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we're doing everything very piecemeal, and this is a small component.

579
00:49:29,468 --> 00:49:34,512
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would just like to point out that it's a protocol review.

580
00:49:34,892 --> 00:49:36,794
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a full-scale protocol review.

581
00:49:37,462 --> 00:49:44,307
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the reality is that the cities around the United States, not us, have been hyper-focused on this issue.

582
00:49:44,808 --> 00:49:58,598
[SPEAKER_01]: They've developed committees on safety, both for schools and otherwise, to solicit community feedback and ideas to be included in the formation of their plans and crafting of their first response protocols.

583
00:49:59,099 --> 00:50:06,765
[SPEAKER_01]: They work with architects and engineers and owner's reps to review and improve existing designs to harden their building shells.

584
00:50:07,801 --> 00:50:13,545
[SPEAKER_01]: and come up with distractive techniques within the building in the event of a crisis.

585
00:50:14,006 --> 00:50:17,748
[SPEAKER_01]: And they find the funding and they begin the implementation of those plans.

586
00:50:18,269 --> 00:50:19,530
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't done any of that.

587
00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:21,571
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not even speaking about that.

588
00:50:21,992 --> 00:50:24,353
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is really the crux of the problem.

589
00:50:24,674 --> 00:50:33,520
[SPEAKER_01]: The crux of the matter, from a solution perspective, isn't to cherry pick each and individual piece, but it's to look at it holistically.

590
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:34,841
[SPEAKER_01]: And not only to

591
00:50:36,758 --> 00:50:48,484
[SPEAKER_01]: deal with it from a logistical perspective, but to provide information to the people who are the most likely target, which is our students and our staff and our schools.

592
00:50:49,165 --> 00:50:57,509
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to provide them with information on how to respond, when to respond, and practice those responses so their muscle memories kick in.

593
00:50:58,378 --> 00:51:07,889
[SPEAKER_01]: And talking about rental and talking about who can use it and talking about storage and all the other pieces are just small pieces to the larger puzzle.

594
00:51:08,470 --> 00:51:11,693
[SPEAKER_01]: The frightening fact is that we're not keeping up with the times.

595
00:51:12,454 --> 00:51:14,076
[SPEAKER_01]: In Medford, we've fallen behind.

596
00:51:14,657 --> 00:51:18,601
[SPEAKER_01]: We've spent thousands upon thousands of dollars on other projects.

597
00:51:19,492 --> 00:51:23,735
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've let this crucial issue fall to the wayside.

598
00:51:24,215 --> 00:51:33,261
[SPEAKER_01]: When you think about the different projects we've spent and monies to expedite some of them, some of the measures that you can do for a single school cost under $400,000.

599
00:51:34,101 --> 00:51:42,907
[SPEAKER_01]: And while that seems like a large amount of money, we spent $500,000 to expedite the Riverside Plaza project.

600
00:51:43,547 --> 00:51:45,928
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's all about looking at the large picture.

601
00:51:46,349 --> 00:51:48,390
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's my point, and that's why I'm here.

602
00:51:49,204 --> 00:51:56,988
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to say that I believe our focus has been on the wrong place, and we as a community need to be direct.

603
00:51:57,568 --> 00:52:01,890
[SPEAKER_01]: Had even some of our energy and effort been spent on concrete assessments

604
00:52:02,475 --> 00:52:08,679
[SPEAKER_01]: and plans to protect our schools and our public buildings, there would have been a protocol in place.

605
00:52:09,379 --> 00:52:18,405
[SPEAKER_01]: The issue wouldn't have been left to the discretion of the administrative team on staff that week because they would have known what the protocol was and they would have followed it.

606
00:52:18,945 --> 00:52:20,667
[SPEAKER_01]: So absent of that protocol,

607
00:52:21,627 --> 00:52:24,010
[SPEAKER_01]: They made their judgment on what to do.

608
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:28,274
[SPEAKER_01]: In hindsight, we all believe it was not the right judgment.

609
00:52:28,715 --> 00:52:35,321
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't think if you reflect as an individual, everybody would say, I absolutely would have called the police.

610
00:52:35,942 --> 00:52:36,162
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?

611
00:52:36,543 --> 00:52:44,171
[SPEAKER_01]: So my final point in closing is that my issue is I believe we have an issue with transparency and approachability.

612
00:52:45,177 --> 00:52:53,181
[SPEAKER_01]: There were people and there are people that are resident stakeholders and subject matter experts who have raised the issue over and over.

613
00:52:53,542 --> 00:52:59,765
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've been disregarded and they've been silenced because some people don't know what they don't know.

614
00:52:59,785 --> 00:53:03,907
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only way you're going to get that information is if you allow people to speak.

615
00:53:04,607 --> 00:53:08,810
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a dedicated focus in this city to urbanize the city of Medford.

616
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:14,753
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need to, in conjunction with that effort, if it will move forward, do what needs to be done

617
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:17,361
[SPEAKER_01]: to prepare us for what urbanization means.

618
00:53:18,041 --> 00:53:21,164
[SPEAKER_01]: This event is a wake-up call to our community.

619
00:53:22,005 --> 00:53:29,111
[SPEAKER_01]: This administration in this city needs to become fully transparent and participative immediately, at all levels.

620
00:53:29,871 --> 00:53:38,839
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be clear to everyone at this moment, in this time, that in a disaster situation, we would and will be lacking in the essentials we need.

621
00:53:39,678 --> 00:53:57,109
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless this administration's approach to planning and implementation is overhauled immediately, I urge you to become familiar with the steps and frameworks other cities and communities are taking to investigate these, not just a single, but an overarching.

622
00:53:57,829 --> 00:54:04,754
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to focus on this crucial item swiftly, but with decisive, methodical, measured approach.

623
00:54:05,454 --> 00:54:06,375
[SPEAKER_01]: Change is difficult.

624
00:54:07,587 --> 00:54:15,470
[SPEAKER_01]: Planning is tedious, but we as a community can rise to the challenge, if not for our children, then for who?

625
00:54:16,110 --> 00:54:19,191
[SPEAKER_01]: Please look at this as a holistic issue and not just cherry pick.

626
00:54:19,931 --> 00:54:21,932
[SPEAKER_01]: I urge you to do that as a planner.

627
00:54:22,412 --> 00:54:29,014
[SPEAKER_01]: I urge you to look at the issue in its entirety, if for no one else, for our kids, because they really need to be.

628
00:54:29,074 --> 00:54:30,515
[SPEAKER_04]: One information, Councilor Knight.

629
00:54:30,755 --> 00:54:35,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Just last week, the council did vote to request that the administration issue an RFP

630
00:54:37,995 --> 00:54:45,798
[SPEAKER_04]: hire an independent security expert to perform an assessment, a safety and security assessment at all our public buildings, which includes our public schools as well.

631
00:54:45,838 --> 00:54:48,139
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can't agree with you more wholeheartedly, Ms.

632
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:51,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Nuzzo, when you say about needing a holistic approach and not taking a piecemeal approach to it.

633
00:54:51,501 --> 00:54:52,101
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

634
00:54:52,121 --> 00:54:53,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

635
00:54:57,323 --> 00:55:02,546
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would just ask, I don't know if there's a motion that you can make to begin that process more quickly.

636
00:55:02,926 --> 00:55:07,808
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a security RFP will take time and security will only look at one component.

637
00:55:09,042 --> 00:55:19,904
[SPEAKER_01]: If I would make you any recommendation, it would be that you need someone to kind of be the point of the spear on this, because there will be, if you look at other communities, a security component is only one side.

638
00:55:20,264 --> 00:55:31,426
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got the building structure, you've got the building technologies, you've got the manpower, transparency and position, landscaping, architecture, it's a very complex issue.

639
00:55:31,766 --> 00:55:35,027
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, I appreciate your time.

640
00:55:35,047 --> 00:55:36,147
[SPEAKER_09]: Excuse me, name and address of the record, please.

641
00:55:37,601 --> 00:55:38,502
[SPEAKER_09]: Paul Halloween Jr.

642
00:55:38,522 --> 00:55:39,543
[SPEAKER_09]: 29 row left.

643
00:55:40,524 --> 00:55:42,126
[SPEAKER_09]: Question to the chair for Council Marks.

644
00:55:42,506 --> 00:55:53,879
[SPEAKER_09]: When it comes to security, when it comes to the security part of your amendment, is that just so I can understand it, is that like a high security guard, someone who works in school or a police officer?

645
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:55,361
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilmarks.

646
00:55:57,143 --> 00:55:57,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr President.

647
00:55:58,402 --> 00:56:01,444
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be up to the school committee to decide what they consider security.

648
00:56:01,824 --> 00:56:11,371
[SPEAKER_02]: We currently have security officers at the school department, we have police personnel in the community, so it would be under their purview to figure out who they want there as security.

649
00:56:11,811 --> 00:56:25,101
[SPEAKER_02]: But having an organization or a group determine their own security and who they internally will report as security, to me is inadequate and not a prudent way of operating.

650
00:56:26,362 --> 00:56:27,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Matz.

651
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:27,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lococo.

652
00:56:28,487 --> 00:56:29,568
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll yield to the speaker.

653
00:56:29,588 --> 00:56:31,929
[SPEAKER_05]: Name and address for the record, please.

654
00:56:32,209 --> 00:56:34,571
[SPEAKER_10]: Joyce Paul, 8 Mason Street, Medford, Mass.

655
00:56:35,271 --> 00:56:41,795
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanted to say I agree with Mr. Marks and Brianna Longo Kern, and I want to thank both of you.

656
00:56:42,255 --> 00:56:44,076
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's very, very unfortunate.

657
00:56:44,657 --> 00:56:50,240
[SPEAKER_10]: When I came to Medford, you know, I thought of this as a very different town, and it's just the way things are.

658
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:55,403
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think it's rational and reasonable and sensible, and I think something needs to be done.

659
00:56:56,005 --> 00:57:01,829
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it's unfortunate and sad, but I think it is reasonable, and I support what you have to say.

660
00:57:01,989 --> 00:57:02,810
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

661
00:57:02,830 --> 00:57:03,130
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

662
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:03,931
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Lungo-Curran.

663
00:57:04,191 --> 00:57:05,332
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, President Carviello.

664
00:57:05,432 --> 00:57:19,182
[SPEAKER_11]: I would just like to amend this if my councilor doesn't mind, council colleague doesn't mind, or create a B paper that a full security audit of our schools be conducted, even if we have to hire an outside consultant.

665
00:57:22,666 --> 00:57:23,507
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

666
00:57:23,587 --> 00:57:29,834
[SPEAKER_05]: On the B paper that a full security audit be done of the school system.

667
00:57:29,854 --> 00:57:34,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't we vote on that amendment last week?

668
00:57:34,359 --> 00:57:34,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we did.

669
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:41,091
[SPEAKER_08]: And is the amendment in order or out of order?

670
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:43,632
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a more specific order.

671
00:57:43,752 --> 00:57:52,496
[SPEAKER_05]: The motion last week was for every public building, which does encompass the schools also.

672
00:57:53,156 --> 00:57:54,577
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for your ruling, Mr. President.

673
00:57:54,597 --> 00:57:54,857
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

674
00:57:56,357 --> 00:57:57,818
[SPEAKER_08]: Move the question, Mr. President.

675
00:57:57,838 --> 00:58:02,020
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Councilor Marks, as amended by Councilor... Roll call vote, Mr. President.

676
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:05,381
[SPEAKER_05]: As amended by Councilor Marks and as amended by Councilor McLaren.

677
00:58:05,621 --> 00:58:06,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

678
00:58:17,307 --> 00:58:18,548
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President DelaRusso?

679
00:58:20,790 --> 00:58:20,950
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

680
00:58:22,531 --> 00:58:23,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Falco?

681
00:58:23,412 --> 00:58:25,373
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

682
00:58:25,393 --> 00:58:25,934
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Nye?

683
00:58:26,074 --> 00:58:26,294
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

684
00:58:26,995 --> 00:58:27,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Kern?

685
00:58:27,855 --> 00:58:27,995
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

686
00:58:28,936 --> 00:58:29,597
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Mox?

687
00:58:29,777 --> 00:58:29,997
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

688
00:58:30,938 --> 00:58:31,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli?

689
00:58:31,838 --> 00:58:32,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

690
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:33,480
[SPEAKER_06]: President Calvillo?

691
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:33,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

692
00:58:35,441 --> 00:58:38,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Five in the affirmative, two in the negative, motion passes.

693
00:58:39,216 --> 00:59:03,408
[SPEAKER_05]: 18-099, offered by Council Member Kern, whereas high levels of lead were found at Riverbend Park, and whereas the location is right next to the Andrews School in the soccer fields behind the Andrews Inn, whereas after my request, this City Council voted to do additional testing behind the Andrews, and whereas high levels of lead were found behind the Andrews at the 2.2-7 foot level, be it resolved,

694
00:59:03,798 --> 00:59:11,182
[SPEAKER_05]: that the testing location be expanded, and that prior testing locations be further tested from the zero to two foot level.

695
00:59:11,242 --> 00:59:12,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lungo-Kern.

696
00:59:13,323 --> 00:59:14,784
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, President Carviello.

697
00:59:15,744 --> 00:59:32,653
[SPEAKER_11]: We all received a map of the testing locations, those behind Riverbend Park, and then those that the city council requested be done behind the Andrews School, along the lines of close to the soccer fields where our children play soccer on Saturday and Sunday.

698
00:59:34,168 --> 00:59:37,909
[SPEAKER_11]: That was done, and I pushed and pushed for the results to be sent to us.

699
00:59:38,169 --> 00:59:40,610
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm very thankful that they did the testing.

700
00:59:40,970 --> 00:59:47,892
[SPEAKER_11]: There was an additional five locations that were tested after our council request, and lead was found.

701
00:59:48,412 --> 00:59:49,213
[SPEAKER_11]: I did speak to Ms.

702
00:59:49,253 --> 00:59:51,253
[SPEAKER_11]: Hunt about this a few weeks ago.

703
00:59:51,913 --> 00:59:55,515
[SPEAKER_11]: She told me that the lead was found between two and seven feet.

704
00:59:57,235 --> 00:59:59,496
[SPEAKER_11]: She knew exactly what my next question was going to be.

705
00:59:59,576 --> 01:00:03,557
[SPEAKER_11]: She said, you're wondering, are we going to test between zero and two feet?

706
01:00:04,110 --> 01:00:06,612
[SPEAKER_11]: And I believe her answer was she was not sure of that.

707
01:00:07,333 --> 01:00:29,571
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'm publicly requesting and asking my council to support a vote with regards to testing at the, especially behind the Andrews where our children are, I think behind Riverbend, I'm not sure if it's utilized, but behind the Andrews, I'd like the testing expanded to make sure, to see what the levels of lead are on the grounds where our children are playing soccer.

708
01:00:30,352 --> 01:00:32,194
[SPEAKER_11]: And also a testing of,

709
01:00:33,012 --> 01:00:37,615
[SPEAKER_11]: some testing of the zero to two feet marking points.

710
01:00:37,715 --> 01:00:44,300
[SPEAKER_11]: Because if we have lead from zero to two feet, that is not healthy for our children.

711
01:00:44,700 --> 01:01:00,011
[SPEAKER_11]: And with there being a school right there and hundreds of kids playing soccer and after school activities, I just think it concerned me when this came forward probably, jeez, nine, 10, 11 months ago.

712
01:01:02,489 --> 01:01:05,191
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that the updated testing was done in October of 2017.

713
01:01:07,033 --> 01:01:10,716
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is just something that I think is necessary to move forward.

714
01:01:10,736 --> 01:01:25,788
[SPEAKER_11]: I know we're going to have an expense if this needs to be cleaned up, but we need to know, knowing obviously we can, there'll be different ways that we'll be able to figure out how to work with this, but we need to make sure that where our children are playing is safe.

715
01:01:26,388 --> 01:01:32,033
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would just move approval, ask for a roll call vote that we expand the testing behind the Andrews.

716
01:01:32,774 --> 01:01:40,059
[SPEAKER_11]: As you probably saw when you looked, when you open your email, it's closer to the walkway where the additional testing was done.

717
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:51,347
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just looking for some additional testing to see how far it's crept in and also just some surface level testing so that we can make sure there's not lead from the zero to two foot mark.

718
01:01:51,727 --> 01:01:55,670
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would just ask for a roll call vote and my support by my colleagues.

719
01:01:55,790 --> 01:01:56,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor.

720
01:01:56,410 --> 01:01:56,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

721
01:01:57,701 --> 01:02:00,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, I certainly have no problem supporting this paper this evening.

722
01:02:00,463 --> 01:02:13,873
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to ask permission from the Council to add a B paper on it, just to get a report back from the administration, maybe in a committee of the whole setting, as to what impact these findings are going to have on the expansion of the Clippership Connector, Mr. President.

723
01:02:14,433 --> 01:02:21,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Ultimately, I think we found out about this pollution through test borings that were done in anticipation of the extension of the Clippership Trail.

724
01:02:22,180 --> 01:02:26,064
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that that's kind of gotten us to the point where we're at today.

725
01:02:26,105 --> 01:02:30,370
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd like to have an update, Mr. President, to determine what's going on with that project as well.

726
01:02:32,698 --> 01:02:33,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, thank you, Mr. President.

727
01:02:33,619 --> 01:02:35,881
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank council Longo current for bringing this up.

728
01:02:36,542 --> 01:02:42,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, this is a logical next step, especially because of the proximity to, uh, the Andrew school.

729
01:02:43,028 --> 01:02:46,291
[SPEAKER_02]: And I support this tonight, Mr. President on the motion.

730
01:02:46,611 --> 01:02:47,272
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Falco.

731
01:02:47,552 --> 01:02:49,074
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

732
01:02:49,174 --> 01:02:50,955
[SPEAKER_12]: I also just want to go and recognize supporting this.

733
01:02:51,016 --> 01:02:52,137
[SPEAKER_12]: I think this is a good resolution.

734
01:02:52,177 --> 01:02:53,498
[SPEAKER_12]: I think this is a great next step.

735
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:57,342
[SPEAKER_12]: We need to make sure that this is safe for everyone.

736
01:02:58,063 --> 01:03:04,787
[SPEAKER_12]: Like we said earlier, there are plenty of kids that use the fields on the weekends for soccer and whatnot.

737
01:03:04,827 --> 01:03:13,173
[SPEAKER_12]: But you also have children that are traversing those fields on a daily basis, getting to and from school, and using those trails behind the school as well.

738
01:03:13,513 --> 01:03:14,694
[SPEAKER_12]: So I move approval.

739
01:03:15,434 --> 01:03:16,135
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli.

740
01:03:16,881 --> 01:03:17,581
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

741
01:03:17,601 --> 01:03:34,588
[SPEAKER_14]: I apologize for stepping out for a second, but before I heard this writing, I wanted to just reiterate Councilor Longo-Curran's appreciation for getting this out and understanding that, you know, it's frightening to think where it is and where it could be.

742
01:03:34,688 --> 01:03:45,592
[SPEAKER_14]: So, expanding it and making sure that our safety of our children, again, in another format is foremost and most important.

743
01:03:45,632 --> 01:03:46,092
[SPEAKER_14]: So, thank you.

744
01:03:47,807 --> 01:03:51,170
[SPEAKER_05]: not to mention the newly implemented dog park.

745
01:03:51,630 --> 01:03:52,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Name and address for the record, please.

746
01:03:54,693 --> 01:03:58,797
[SPEAKER_13]: Andrew Castaneda, Cushing Street.

747
01:04:02,780 --> 01:04:12,269
[SPEAKER_13]: What I'm about to say, it all ties in, so bear with me, Council President, to this Clippership Connector path and behind it, Dr. Andrews.

748
01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:18,763
[SPEAKER_13]: First of all, the Douglas Andrews and the McGlynn was probably built on a dump, if I remember correctly.

749
01:04:19,703 --> 01:04:23,126
[SPEAKER_13]: However, that worked out as far as testing, I don't know.

750
01:04:25,267 --> 01:04:36,014
[SPEAKER_13]: I find it unfortunate, as I say in the real estate business, that there's a dirty 21E involved, meaning pollution in the earth, dirt.

751
01:04:38,535 --> 01:04:55,127
[SPEAKER_13]: It's very appalling, it's more than appalling to me that this missing clipper ship connected, which is about a half a mile from behind the Salton Star building to the Dr. Andrews ray yard.

752
01:04:56,668 --> 01:05:03,994
[SPEAKER_13]: It's probably a half mile, otherwise you could go from the center of Memphis Square all the way past Arlington.

753
01:05:05,162 --> 01:05:14,066
[SPEAKER_13]: And on the east side, you could go from the Dark of Andrews all the way and not deal with Route 16 or Route 28 and walk to the subway station.

754
01:05:15,887 --> 01:05:16,768
[SPEAKER_13]: Capital idea.

755
01:05:18,789 --> 01:05:27,633
[SPEAKER_13]: Unfortunately, it seems that the leadership here has not done the half mile behind you, Council President.

756
01:05:30,295 --> 01:05:32,616
[SPEAKER_13]: And I find that more than appalling because

757
01:05:33,744 --> 01:05:36,985
[SPEAKER_13]: As you stated, it was not an official bike path, Council President.

758
01:05:37,426 --> 01:05:55,313
[SPEAKER_13]: However, one week after I threw my hat into the ring to run for city council, I was driving and riding my bicycle near the Mystic River, within five feet of the river, next to Route 93, near the Riverside Yacht Club.

759
01:05:56,173 --> 01:05:58,034
[SPEAKER_13]: And my front tire went into a sinkhole,

760
01:05:59,796 --> 01:06:04,960
[SPEAKER_13]: And I had a severe head injury, concussion, and broken bones.

761
01:06:06,141 --> 01:06:11,346
[SPEAKER_13]: When I finally got home, my wife took me to the Lawrence Memorial Hospital, I guess it's called.

762
01:06:12,587 --> 01:06:15,309
[SPEAKER_13]: And we had all kinds of repair work done.

763
01:06:20,413 --> 01:06:22,775
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't understand why it's not done.

764
01:06:24,176 --> 01:06:27,779
[SPEAKER_13]: And if the zero to two foot level has not been tested,

765
01:06:29,290 --> 01:06:47,833
[SPEAKER_13]: If the Douglas Andrews is okay to put a piece of tar on there for their bike path, footpath, and stone dust on the Tom Lincoln side that he designed, well, if you're not gonna disturb the soil, I can't see why we're getting into this big ball of wax trouble.

766
01:06:47,893 --> 01:06:52,074
[SPEAKER_05]: It goes beyond the scope of the bike path.

767
01:06:52,094 --> 01:06:56,315
[SPEAKER_05]: There's playgrounds there, there's a lot more than the bike path involved there.

768
01:06:56,495 --> 01:06:57,515
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the reason.

769
01:06:58,450 --> 01:07:00,110
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not just talking about the bike path.

770
01:07:00,130 --> 01:07:01,071
[SPEAKER_13]: So the schools are?

771
01:07:01,531 --> 01:07:03,391
[SPEAKER_05]: The schools, there's kids that play there, there's a new park.

772
01:07:03,411 --> 01:07:05,991
[SPEAKER_13]: They have car parks that their grandfather know?

773
01:07:06,592 --> 01:07:13,033
[SPEAKER_05]: No, Council Member Kern is asking that those areas also be tested to see what's going on there also.

774
01:07:13,273 --> 01:07:15,273
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're not just concerned with the bike path.

775
01:07:15,293 --> 01:07:24,055
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, my second point would be, from behind the Salton Star building, where the path does not exist,

776
01:07:25,785 --> 01:07:28,607
[SPEAKER_13]: towards all the way to the Doug Andrews border.

777
01:07:29,988 --> 01:07:45,658
[SPEAKER_13]: That is underneath Route 93, behind 76 Ship Avenue, behind 54 to 68 Ship Avenue, behind the Riverside Yacht Club, which leases the land.

778
01:07:45,698 --> 01:07:48,640
[SPEAKER_13]: They don't own it, to the best of my knowledge.

779
01:07:50,021 --> 01:07:53,643
[SPEAKER_13]: And behind Shipside Green at 20 Ship Avenue.

780
01:07:54,553 --> 01:07:57,454
[SPEAKER_13]: where the dirty 21E is in the back.

781
01:07:58,874 --> 01:07:59,995
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's all fenced off.

782
01:08:00,815 --> 01:08:03,356
[SPEAKER_13]: So I don't have egress to that area either.

783
01:08:07,057 --> 01:08:23,662
[SPEAKER_13]: This bike path should be built on the people's land under riparian rights in the 1630s, Massachusetts law, that we the people have the rights within so many feet of mean high tide.

784
01:08:24,788 --> 01:08:27,950
[SPEAKER_13]: If I recollect, when I was a child, high tide came up to the Karate Bridge.

785
01:08:28,831 --> 01:08:33,553
[SPEAKER_13]: And low tide, that didn't smell so good, but I don't want to get out of track so people can stop laughing.

786
01:08:33,954 --> 01:08:34,814
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm dead serious.

787
01:08:36,275 --> 01:08:40,818
[SPEAKER_13]: In a city like this, you cannot do the half mile path out of the 10 miles?

788
01:08:40,838 --> 01:08:42,879
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, what is wrong?

789
01:08:44,540 --> 01:08:46,121
[SPEAKER_13]: That is the point.

790
01:08:46,141 --> 01:08:46,541
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

791
01:08:47,121 --> 01:08:47,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

792
01:08:47,502 --> 01:08:47,942
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm listening.

793
01:08:50,089 --> 01:08:53,511
[SPEAKER_13]: And why are your children going to the schools behind there?

794
01:08:53,531 --> 01:08:56,012
[SPEAKER_03]: And playing soccer there?

795
01:08:56,052 --> 01:09:00,294
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why Councilor Langel brought the resolution forward for the test.

796
01:09:00,394 --> 01:09:01,155
[SPEAKER_03]: That's her concern.

797
01:09:01,615 --> 01:09:05,557
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it didn't get polluted after the buildings were built, my dear.

798
01:09:08,078 --> 01:09:09,379
[SPEAKER_13]: Think about that.

799
01:09:09,399 --> 01:09:11,840
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the Councilor's concern.

800
01:09:11,860 --> 01:09:14,682
[SPEAKER_13]: So what was the plan under the rug and dirt back then?

801
01:09:19,559 --> 01:09:34,876
[SPEAKER_13]: If it's not done, one year anniversary of my head injury, I believe I will take legal action to get the city to get this job done, the state, Middlesex County, I got them all covered.

802
01:09:35,336 --> 01:09:40,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Longo, Kern's motion is to test the land in several areas of that.

803
01:09:40,261 --> 01:09:41,503
[SPEAKER_05]: It has nothing to do with the bike path.

804
01:09:42,418 --> 01:09:45,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Bike path is a whole separate issue that's not even being addressed.

805
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:50,743
[SPEAKER_13]: If I remember correctly, I was the one that brought this forward, and Breonna took the motion to send it to the mayor.

806
01:09:50,843 --> 01:09:52,524
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, and thank you for the response.

807
01:09:53,865 --> 01:09:55,086
[SPEAKER_13]: I am more than appalled.

808
01:09:57,327 --> 01:09:58,648
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll take care of it if I have to.

809
01:09:59,089 --> 01:09:59,689
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for listening.

810
01:09:59,709 --> 01:10:01,110
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

811
01:10:01,130 --> 01:10:10,516
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Councilor Longo Kern, as amended by Councilor Knight, as seconded by Councilor De La Russo, Mr. Clerk, roll call vote has been requested.

812
01:10:13,941 --> 01:10:14,942
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Dela Cruz, no.

813
01:10:14,962 --> 01:10:16,563
[SPEAKER_06]: Affirmative.

814
01:10:16,703 --> 01:10:17,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Falcone.

815
01:10:17,624 --> 01:10:18,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

816
01:10:18,384 --> 01:10:18,925
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Nye.

817
01:10:19,045 --> 01:10:19,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

818
01:10:19,745 --> 01:10:20,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Leocurt.

819
01:10:20,546 --> 01:10:20,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

820
01:10:21,306 --> 01:10:21,867
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Marks.

821
01:10:21,887 --> 01:10:21,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

822
01:10:22,808 --> 01:10:23,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli.

823
01:10:23,788 --> 01:10:24,089
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

824
01:10:24,809 --> 01:10:25,570
[SPEAKER_06]: President Caviello.

825
01:10:25,690 --> 01:10:29,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, none in the negative, motion passes.

826
01:10:29,933 --> 01:10:39,160
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a few moments of silence here, so if I could read them all at once and we could have one moment of silence.

827
01:10:40,057 --> 01:10:47,261
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple of them are, I'm sorry I left over from last week, but due to the length of the meeting, we held them over this week.

828
01:10:47,321 --> 01:10:48,982
[SPEAKER_05]: So, start off with the first one.

829
01:10:49,722 --> 01:10:56,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Offered by President Caravello, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council expresses sincere condolences to the family of Sina Cutler.

830
01:11:00,277 --> 01:11:01,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, President.

831
01:11:01,678 --> 01:11:13,809
[SPEAKER_05]: Cutler family is a long family history in this community, and their mother just passed away last week, and I want to send my condolences to them.

832
01:11:13,829 --> 01:11:25,220
[SPEAKER_05]: 18, 281, offered by President Caravello, Vice President DelaRusso, Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council's President sends their condolences to the family of Mildred Mimi Ionesa.

833
01:11:27,766 --> 01:11:40,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Move approval by Councilor De La Rosa and offered by Councilor Knight and President Caravaglio, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council send its deepest and say condolences to the family of Joe Small on his recent passing.

834
01:11:40,273 --> 01:11:42,995
[SPEAKER_05]: If we could please rise for a moment of silence, please.

835
01:11:43,015 --> 01:11:54,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

836
01:11:54,682 --> 01:11:55,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, just if I could,

837
01:11:57,418 --> 01:11:57,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Knox.

838
01:11:58,498 --> 01:12:03,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Just if I could, on Mildred Ionesa, I just wanted to say a few words.

839
01:12:03,701 --> 01:12:06,162
[SPEAKER_02]: I've known Mildred for a number of years.

840
01:12:06,942 --> 01:12:17,347
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's always had a smile on her face, a good word to say about people, and a true family person that family always came first.

841
01:12:18,107 --> 01:12:20,048
[SPEAKER_02]: And she will be sorely missed, Mr. President.

842
01:12:20,208 --> 01:12:20,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

843
01:12:21,209 --> 01:12:21,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Night.

844
01:12:21,709 --> 01:12:24,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, just a brief bit on Joe Small.

845
01:12:25,390 --> 01:12:40,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Small was a lifelong Medford resident, longtime firefighter, very involved in the professional firefighters of Massachusetts, one of the founding members to help bring workplace safety and occupational health initiatives forward as an organization through organized labor.

846
01:12:40,822 --> 01:12:42,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, he's going to be sadly missed.

847
01:12:42,803 --> 01:12:50,509
[SPEAKER_04]: He was a good man, a good citizen in the city of Medford, a great grandfather, and someone that put himself before others to ensure their safety in the workplace.

848
01:12:50,529 --> 01:12:52,570
[SPEAKER_04]: So he will be sadly missed, and I offer my condolences.

849
01:12:52,590 --> 01:12:52,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

850
01:12:54,428 --> 01:12:55,269
[SPEAKER_05]: And one last one here.

851
01:12:57,492 --> 01:13:04,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Offered by Councilor Scott Pelley, be it resolved that the DPW, Director, investigate this colored water in the Lawrence Estate neighborhood.

852
01:13:04,902 --> 01:13:05,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scott Pelley.

853
01:13:06,803 --> 01:13:07,684
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

854
01:13:07,824 --> 01:13:19,074
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, I just had a few phone calls in the last couple days, one before I left, that if we can just have the director of DPW, maybe some from the Water Department, do some testing.

855
01:13:19,735 --> 01:13:25,220
[SPEAKER_14]: They've had some issues with discolored, rusty water in that area periodically.

856
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:32,146
[SPEAKER_14]: So if we can see, or if they can update any work that's being done so we can update our residents, it would be greatly appreciated.

857
01:13:32,186 --> 01:13:32,406
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

858
01:13:33,085 --> 01:13:35,326
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor DelaRusso.

859
01:13:35,827 --> 01:13:40,810
[SPEAKER_07]: And in the matter of public safety, if they could test the water to make sure there's not any cross-contamination there.

860
01:13:41,310 --> 01:13:41,890
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

861
01:13:43,011 --> 01:13:48,454
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Councilor Scarpelli, as amended by Councilor DelaRusso, seconded by Councilor Falco.

862
01:13:48,934 --> 01:13:49,715
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

863
01:13:49,855 --> 01:13:49,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

864
01:13:50,575 --> 01:13:51,656
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

865
01:13:52,196 --> 01:13:54,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Petitions, presentations, and similar matters.

866
01:13:56,781 --> 01:14:07,125
[SPEAKER_05]: 18282 petition by Robert M. Penta, 0 Summit Road, Bedford, Mass., to address the council regarding the Bedford Police Department's in the ammunition gun clip found at the McGlynn Middle School.

867
01:14:07,786 --> 01:14:12,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Penta, I'm going to, before we get started, this is an ongoing police matter.

868
01:14:14,409 --> 01:14:16,530
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would hope that- I understand that.

869
01:14:16,650 --> 01:14:19,091
[SPEAKER_05]: That you respect that and please

870
01:14:20,822 --> 01:14:22,082
[SPEAKER_05]: Take the proper precautions.

871
01:14:22,723 --> 01:14:28,424
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll give you the leeway that you need, but please understand, we don't want to have to stop in the middle of this.

872
01:14:29,025 --> 01:14:29,345
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

873
01:14:29,405 --> 01:14:30,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Next special director, please.

874
01:14:31,125 --> 01:14:33,686
[SPEAKER_16]: My name is Robert Pentez, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass.

875
01:14:34,406 --> 01:14:45,209
[SPEAKER_16]: The stress and anxiety of Clipgate, that's what I call it, Clipgate, has needlessly caused our city an embarrassed showing for collective management when they thought nobody was looking.

876
01:14:45,850 --> 01:14:49,991
[SPEAKER_16]: Dating back to December 28th, when the ammo clip was first found,

877
01:14:50,832 --> 01:14:59,333
[SPEAKER_16]: A cast of characters have become principal components to the investigation, starting with the cleaning company personnel who first found the clip.

878
01:15:00,034 --> 01:15:20,437
[SPEAKER_16]: We have further parties of interest in the school custodian, Mr. Edwards, the principal at the McGlynn School, Mr. Belson, the school superintendent, the resource officer, Memphis police officer, Riccati, Mr. McLaughlin, director of building and grounds, Mayor Burke, and school employees who brought this to the attention of Councilor Lungo-Kern.

879
01:15:21,859 --> 01:15:34,385
[SPEAKER_16]: When Councilor Langel-Kern notified the police on Thursday, December 15th, of this concern brought to her attention by school employees, the school building was swept on Tuesday, February 20th, according to news reports.

880
01:15:35,225 --> 01:15:42,849
[SPEAKER_16]: Thankfully, Brianna Langel-Kern and Councilor Marks addressed this matter at their next council meeting with many concerned parents in attendance.

881
01:15:43,889 --> 01:15:45,230
[SPEAKER_16]: This past Thursday, February 22nd,

882
01:15:46,573 --> 01:15:48,614
[SPEAKER_16]: at the Karen Little Theater at Medford High School.

883
01:15:49,434 --> 01:16:00,917
[SPEAKER_16]: Seven days after Breonna Lungelkorn notified police, the mayor called for a school committee meeting wherein hundreds of Medford citizens, teachers, and administrators attended to discuss the matter.

884
01:16:01,997 --> 01:16:10,640
[SPEAKER_16]: When Mayor Burke, as chairperson of the school committee, first found out about this matter, and from whom and what did she do, she has yet to disclose that matter.

885
01:16:11,714 --> 01:16:23,862
[SPEAKER_16]: While the February 22nd meeting revealed a lot of anger and displeasure as to what the Clipgate incident has caused, it also revealed shortcomings to questions asked.

886
01:16:24,843 --> 01:16:32,507
[SPEAKER_16]: One glaring question, and yet to be answered, was, who was the we that decided not to share the info at the outset?

887
01:16:33,908 --> 01:16:40,633
[SPEAKER_16]: The Meffitt Police, under the direction of Chief Sacco, is leading the in-house investigation regarding this incident, as he should.

888
01:16:41,664 --> 01:16:59,087
[SPEAKER_16]: If the Medford police are good enough to investigate a murder, stolen property, drug dealing, and other crimes within their daily jobs, they now don't need to be upstaged by the mayor and her hiring of her close, personal, and financially rewarding political friend, Martha Coakley.

889
01:17:00,247 --> 01:17:22,663
[SPEAKER_16]: Mayor Burke, on her own, without any discussion, approval, or vote of record from the school committee, has hired her close personal friend, former Attorney General Martha Coakley, who has contributed $1,000 to Mayor Burke's campaign to do this independent personnel investigation because of this matter as it's reported in the news reports.

890
01:17:23,868 --> 01:17:31,474
[SPEAKER_16]: This independent personnel investigation should have no ties nor relationships to any politicians in our cities.

891
01:17:32,535 --> 01:17:35,057
[SPEAKER_16]: I ask, where is the transparency to this matter?

892
01:17:35,898 --> 01:17:38,139
[SPEAKER_16]: Independent means just what it says.

893
01:17:39,020 --> 01:17:49,949
[SPEAKER_16]: Free and devoid from any influence, guidance, or counsel of another or others, nor affiliated with or loyal to no one political party, organization, or voter.

894
01:17:50,767 --> 01:17:53,609
[SPEAKER_16]: Both Mrs. Burke and Mrs. Coakley are both Democrats.

895
01:17:54,670 --> 01:18:03,655
[SPEAKER_16]: This hiring of Martha Coakley by Mayor Burke is a sole source contract, a contract awarded without competitive bidding.

896
01:18:04,476 --> 01:18:13,402
[SPEAKER_16]: It directs itself to cronyism, particularly in awarding jobs to friends or trusted colleagues in politics between politicians.

897
01:18:14,375 --> 01:18:22,855
[SPEAKER_16]: This hiring also prevents presents, excuse me, a serious question as to whether Mayor Burke has violated the state ethics law on the chapter 62.

898
01:18:24,318 --> 01:18:35,886
[SPEAKER_16]: Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 268A, wherein the law states if a conflict is apparent, or the appearance is a telling sign, then a violation of the law is readily at hand.

899
01:18:36,627 --> 01:18:47,554
[SPEAKER_16]: A public employee may not act in a manner that would cause a reasonable person to think that she would show favor toward someone or that she can be improperly influenced.

900
01:18:48,535 --> 01:18:52,338
[SPEAKER_16]: I stand here not to question the ability or the capability

901
01:18:53,222 --> 01:19:07,497
[SPEAKER_16]: of Martha Coakley, but rather the concern of a state ethics conflict of interest, as well as to her individual unspecified cost from her very expensive downtown Boston law firm of Foley and Hogue.

902
01:19:08,798 --> 01:19:13,202
[SPEAKER_16]: Mayor Burke's relationship with Martha Coakley has been long and financially rewarding.

903
01:19:14,150 --> 01:19:26,846
[SPEAKER_16]: I find it interesting that Mayor Burke is now concerned with having an independent personnel investigation, but where is her outside independent audit of the school department if she is so concerned about righting the ship?

904
01:19:27,832 --> 01:19:36,575
[SPEAKER_16]: I do not believe we need a very expensive, close, personal, and political friend of the mayor to address Medford's employee personnel policies.

905
01:19:37,495 --> 01:19:40,396
[SPEAKER_16]: Medford is a good city with tons of good people in it.

906
01:19:41,156 --> 01:19:56,641
[SPEAKER_16]: Let this incident be the thoughtful reminder that when the law is not followed and protocols are not in place, and when city leaders take it upon themselves to make decisions that fly in the face of potential safety and what the law says,

907
01:19:57,221 --> 01:20:03,465
[SPEAKER_16]: then all involved, no matter who, as this case has demonstrated, shall be held accountable.

908
01:20:04,826 --> 01:20:07,627
[SPEAKER_16]: For the truth only has one consequence.

909
01:20:08,468 --> 01:20:11,229
[SPEAKER_16]: Let no cover-up be worse than the crime itself.

910
01:20:12,730 --> 01:20:18,774
[SPEAKER_16]: I would like to conclude by making a correction to a statement I made last Thursday at the school committee meeting.

911
01:20:19,743 --> 01:20:28,066
[SPEAKER_16]: At the conclusion of my commentary and in my haste, I misread what I meant to say, and it was as follows, what I meant to say.

912
01:20:28,807 --> 01:20:33,508
[SPEAKER_16]: What happened in Florida was horrific, and hopefully we all have learned something here tonight.

913
01:20:34,269 --> 01:20:38,450
[SPEAKER_16]: The people of Meffitt want action, and as city officials, you owe it to them.

914
01:20:39,411 --> 01:20:42,332
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, with that being said, Mr. President, again,

915
01:20:43,374 --> 01:20:48,996
[SPEAKER_16]: You folks have been through the whole issue of conflict of interest, whether it be your pay raises or jobs.

916
01:20:49,616 --> 01:20:51,257
[SPEAKER_16]: This is a very serious matter.

917
01:20:52,077 --> 01:21:02,021
[SPEAKER_16]: This hiring of Mrs. Coakley out of the Clear Blue Sky, while this incident is going on, I believe does not speak well for the police investigation.

918
01:21:02,041 --> 01:21:03,942
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think it speaks well for the Memphis Police Department.

919
01:21:04,722 --> 01:21:07,123
[SPEAKER_16]: They can handle their own investigation, and if it turns out to be

920
01:21:07,505 --> 01:21:09,848
[SPEAKER_16]: something on one of their own, they will resolve it.

921
01:21:10,128 --> 01:21:15,415
[SPEAKER_16]: If it's something that's resolved here in the building, an employee, it will be resolved internally.

922
01:21:15,435 --> 01:21:17,518
[SPEAKER_16]: And if the need is to have

923
01:21:17,934 --> 01:21:24,420
[SPEAKER_16]: an updated personnel policy that hasn't taken place since this mayor has come into being, well then so be it.

924
01:21:25,060 --> 01:21:37,311
[SPEAKER_16]: But to hire someone who paid you, strike that, who gave you $1,000 in political contributions, smacks with the theory that this is directly a conflict of interest.

925
01:21:37,591 --> 01:21:39,333
[SPEAKER_16]: And this is a sole source contract.

926
01:21:39,893 --> 01:21:40,874
[SPEAKER_16]: There was no need for this.

927
01:21:41,821 --> 01:21:44,502
[SPEAKER_16]: There was no need to go out with no competition, no bidding on this.

928
01:21:45,043 --> 01:21:48,984
[SPEAKER_16]: This wasn't a serious emergency that needed to be done and nobody could be contacted.

929
01:21:49,825 --> 01:21:51,566
[SPEAKER_16]: So I really think it needs to be reviewed.

930
01:21:52,166 --> 01:21:55,027
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think the city solicitor needs to review it with you council.

931
01:21:55,067 --> 01:21:57,768
[SPEAKER_16]: I would hope someone on the council would ask that question.

932
01:21:58,449 --> 01:21:59,629
[SPEAKER_16]: Why did the mayor go ahead and do it?

933
01:21:59,649 --> 01:22:06,092
[SPEAKER_16]: The mayor hasn't even notified you fellas and you yet that she's hired Mrs. Coakley for this particular purpose.

934
01:22:06,578 --> 01:22:07,698
[SPEAKER_16]: to do this investigation.

935
01:22:08,279 --> 01:22:09,319
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know how much she charges.

936
01:22:09,819 --> 01:22:11,840
[SPEAKER_16]: People say she charges $500 an hour.

937
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:15,181
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, how many hours is she going to go for and how long is this going to go on for?

938
01:22:16,022 --> 01:22:17,902
[SPEAKER_16]: The taxpayers of this community need to know that.

939
01:22:18,663 --> 01:22:25,866
[SPEAKER_16]: And this issue of her being hired should not be disguised because of this ammo gate that's going on here in the city of Medford.

940
01:22:26,106 --> 01:22:27,826
[SPEAKER_16]: They are two separate issues.

941
01:22:29,227 --> 01:22:31,708
[SPEAKER_16]: And the mayor needs to respond and answer that question.

942
01:22:32,411 --> 01:22:47,402
[SPEAKER_16]: Was she part of the we that made the decision not to disclose the information, dating back as early as December 28th and bringing it up to February 15th when Councilor Longo-Curran brought this to everybody's attention because of people bringing it to her attention.

943
01:22:47,842 --> 01:22:58,390
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, if you remember closely what the Chief said when the question was asked of him about the picture with the clip with the gun, because I was the one that asked him, where did you get that picture, Chief?

944
01:22:58,450 --> 01:22:59,531
[SPEAKER_16]: And he says he got it.

945
01:23:00,046 --> 01:23:02,447
[SPEAKER_16]: from the Director of Buildings and Grounds, Mr. McLaughlin.

946
01:23:03,468 --> 01:23:07,770
[SPEAKER_16]: So I gave you seven people in the beginning that start this whole thing going that have to be interviewed.

947
01:23:08,250 --> 01:23:13,353
[SPEAKER_16]: Possibly every single elected official probably should be interviewed and asked a question, because maybe some of you know.

948
01:23:13,393 --> 01:23:14,674
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe some of you have been told something.

949
01:23:14,954 --> 01:23:15,374
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

950
01:23:16,115 --> 01:23:16,815
[SPEAKER_16]: But you know something?

951
01:23:16,895 --> 01:23:18,356
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a very serious incident.

952
01:23:18,776 --> 01:23:29,382
[SPEAKER_16]: Last Thursday night, up at that high school, there were so many people that were so impassioned as to what they were saying that sometimes it just looked like it might have or it could have gotten out of hand.

953
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:34,343
[SPEAKER_16]: But logic and common sense and calmness has to take place.

954
01:23:35,043 --> 01:23:37,324
[SPEAKER_16]: We all know now that there is an issue out there.

955
01:23:37,585 --> 01:23:40,626
[SPEAKER_16]: We all know that allegedly it was thrown away.

956
01:23:40,666 --> 01:23:46,010
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't know if it was thrown away, if it was misplaced, somebody took it, somebody got rid of it, I don't know.

957
01:23:46,410 --> 01:23:49,052
[SPEAKER_16]: The police report, the police investigation will prove that.

958
01:23:49,912 --> 01:23:58,958
[SPEAKER_16]: But while all that's going on, to hire another paid outside consultant, because that person is a political personal friend of the mayor,

959
01:24:00,195 --> 01:24:01,417
[SPEAKER_16]: My God, come on, folks.

960
01:24:01,597 --> 01:24:04,981
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, there's got to be some checks and balances here.

961
01:24:05,842 --> 01:24:06,143
[SPEAKER_16]: It can't.

962
01:24:06,163 --> 01:24:09,267
[SPEAKER_16]: If it looks like a duck and walks like a duck and smells like a duck, it probably is.

963
01:24:09,647 --> 01:24:11,750
[SPEAKER_16]: Chapter 268A, that's what it says.

964
01:24:12,030 --> 01:24:13,492
[SPEAKER_16]: You can't give the appearance.

965
01:24:13,532 --> 01:24:15,174
[SPEAKER_16]: And this definitely not only gives the

966
01:24:16,556 --> 01:24:17,356
[SPEAKER_16]: You've got the $1,000.

967
01:24:17,697 --> 01:24:18,837
[SPEAKER_16]: You've got the contributions.

968
01:24:19,377 --> 01:24:24,820
[SPEAKER_16]: And she's not only contributed to this mayor, she's contributed to other mayors and other people in this city.

969
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:26,361
[SPEAKER_16]: You can't do that.

970
01:24:26,721 --> 01:24:28,282
[SPEAKER_16]: That's not being independent.

971
01:24:29,122 --> 01:24:31,003
[SPEAKER_16]: That's saying pay to play.

972
01:24:31,303 --> 01:24:36,706
[SPEAKER_16]: And if that's what's going to go on here, then shame on this city and shame on elected officials for allowing this to happen.

973
01:24:37,026 --> 01:24:46,090
[SPEAKER_16]: And I would hope Mrs. Coakley would give a second thought about this and say, well, while it was nice to be asked, I think it would be better for the city of Memphis to find someone

974
01:24:46,350 --> 01:24:50,215
[SPEAKER_16]: who has absolutely no connections if they really want to do an independent policy.

975
01:24:50,596 --> 01:24:52,378
[SPEAKER_16]: You folks are all part of the Mass.

976
01:24:52,418 --> 01:24:53,399
[SPEAKER_16]: Municipal Association.

977
01:24:53,419 --> 01:24:56,724
[SPEAKER_16]: They have a huge department in there to review personnel purposes.

978
01:24:56,964 --> 01:24:57,485
[SPEAKER_16]: You pay.

979
01:24:57,705 --> 01:24:59,547
[SPEAKER_16]: You're a paying member on an annual basis.

980
01:25:00,148 --> 01:25:01,310
[SPEAKER_16]: You should have gone to them first.

981
01:25:02,393 --> 01:25:18,300
[SPEAKER_16]: But to turn around in this situation and disguise it because of what happened with the ammo clip and go out there and hire a Methodist lawyer from one of the most expensive law firms in Boston, and you don't even know what it's going to cost you, it makes no sense at all.

982
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:27,944
[SPEAKER_16]: I would hope one of you somewhere along here puts a request in to have a report as to how and why she was hired, how much is she getting, and if, in fact, this is a conflict of interest.

983
01:25:28,525 --> 01:25:28,825
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

984
01:25:29,285 --> 01:25:31,466
[SPEAKER_16]: You're welcome.

985
01:25:32,343 --> 01:25:33,704
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Dela Russa.

986
01:25:35,145 --> 01:25:48,733
[SPEAKER_07]: I find that the marks of disparagement in Indy Wendo regarding the relationship between the two individuals that were focused upon tonight to be unsavory and predictable.

987
01:25:49,254 --> 01:25:49,614
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

988
01:25:50,474 --> 01:25:50,875
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening.

989
01:25:50,895 --> 01:25:51,875
[SPEAKER_07]: Name and address of the record, please.

990
01:25:51,915 --> 01:25:54,057
[SPEAKER_10]: Joyce Paul, 8 Mason Street, Manford, Mass.

991
01:25:54,317 --> 01:25:59,500
[SPEAKER_10]: I was a warranted contracting officer for the federal government for many years.

992
01:26:00,265 --> 01:26:04,027
[SPEAKER_10]: And I most definitely understand what Mr. Penta has said.

993
01:26:04,447 --> 01:26:05,327
[SPEAKER_10]: And he is correct.

994
01:26:05,407 --> 01:26:06,908
[SPEAKER_10]: There are laws, there are rules.

995
01:26:07,628 --> 01:26:14,231
[SPEAKER_10]: There is a long, long process for people to get contracts and to get positions.

996
01:26:14,992 --> 01:26:22,395
[SPEAKER_10]: And certainly for something this important, I consider important for the city and for our children.

997
01:26:23,578 --> 01:26:30,320
[SPEAKER_10]: I definitely think that this is not appropriate and not saying anything against Miss Coakley.

998
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:33,041
[SPEAKER_10]: But there is a process and there should be a process.

999
01:26:33,121 --> 01:26:45,445
[SPEAKER_10]: And the reason is to have things done not only above board, but so that there is no question that there was anything hidden or anything untoward.

1000
01:26:45,965 --> 01:26:52,727
[SPEAKER_10]: It really, in many ways, protects, in this case, Miss Coakley, as much as it protects anybody else.

1001
01:26:53,228 --> 01:26:58,971
[SPEAKER_10]: But it is, it's federal, it's state, it's local, and it is the way it is.

1002
01:26:59,511 --> 01:27:02,232
[SPEAKER_10]: And it should not have been done the way it was.

1003
01:27:02,312 --> 01:27:04,313
[SPEAKER_10]: That is not legal, that is not okay.

1004
01:27:04,693 --> 01:27:07,115
[SPEAKER_10]: And I definitely support what Mr. Penta has said.

1005
01:27:07,215 --> 01:27:07,555
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1006
01:27:07,655 --> 01:27:07,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1007
01:27:10,196 --> 01:27:11,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Name and address of the record, please.

1008
01:27:11,837 --> 01:27:12,957
[SPEAKER_13]: Castaneda, Cushman Street.

1009
01:27:14,798 --> 01:27:20,421
[SPEAKER_13]: It's, in order to have, what's the word?

1010
01:27:21,823 --> 01:27:24,285
[SPEAKER_13]: no appearance of collusion.

1011
01:27:24,945 --> 01:27:28,928
[SPEAKER_13]: It makes sense to have an independent outsider from far, far away.

1012
01:27:29,268 --> 01:27:42,496
[SPEAKER_13]: If you're going to spend the money, especially, and we had a saying back even prior to the sixties, if you're not part of the solution, maybe it's all part of something else.

1013
01:27:43,077 --> 01:27:43,397
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1014
01:27:45,442 --> 01:27:45,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening.

1015
01:27:45,762 --> 01:27:46,803
[SPEAKER_05]: Name and address to the record, please.

1016
01:27:47,043 --> 01:27:49,784
[SPEAKER_01]: Jean Nuzzo, 35 Paris Street, Medford.

1017
01:27:50,464 --> 01:28:14,975
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to take a moment to reiterate and suggest, if we're going to step outside the bounds of standard procedure and expend money, it's more crucial, in my opinion, I would put forth, to look forward towards solutions to keep the issue from happening again than to spend that money to look back and try to figure out what happened.

1018
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:21,124
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be my suggestion as a resident, as a taxpayer, as a concerned citizen.

1019
01:28:21,724 --> 01:28:22,345
[SPEAKER_01]: It happened.

1020
01:28:23,125 --> 01:28:27,968
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know that we'll ever definitively know, but we do know we're not secure and we're not safe.

1021
01:28:28,449 --> 01:28:34,913
[SPEAKER_01]: And that money would be better spent figuring out how to make our children and our staff in the school safe.

1022
01:28:35,305 --> 01:28:35,585
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1023
01:28:35,825 --> 01:28:41,568
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if anybody behind this rail knows if any money has been expended or if there is any charge, so.

1024
01:28:41,808 --> 01:28:43,469
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand, but it sounds like that's gonna happen.

1025
01:28:43,489 --> 01:28:43,809
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, that's it.

1026
01:28:43,829 --> 01:28:46,310
[SPEAKER_01]: And it sounds like it was done outside the purview of.

1027
01:28:46,330 --> 01:28:47,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, we don't know.

1028
01:28:47,951 --> 01:28:48,991
[SPEAKER_01]: Of a procurement process.

1029
01:28:49,231 --> 01:28:52,173
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think anyone behind this rail has been apprised that.

1030
01:28:52,653 --> 01:28:54,554
[SPEAKER_01]: It was on the news, they were talking about it.

1031
01:28:54,574 --> 01:29:00,676
[SPEAKER_05]: Said that she's been hired, but I don't know, there's been no figure mentioned.

1032
01:29:00,897 --> 01:29:02,677
[SPEAKER_05]: It's under the school department purview, anyways.

1033
01:29:03,318 --> 01:29:03,998
[SPEAKER_05]: Council Member Kern.

1034
01:29:04,937 --> 01:29:09,299
[SPEAKER_01]: don't you approve the school, don't you approve their budget?

1035
01:29:10,239 --> 01:29:11,059
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, so once a year.

1036
01:29:11,259 --> 01:29:12,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1037
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:12,680
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1038
01:29:18,082 --> 01:29:19,582
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, President Carviello.

1039
01:29:19,823 --> 01:29:21,123
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to thank the speaker.

1040
01:29:21,143 --> 01:29:31,267
[SPEAKER_11]: I too have nothing against Martha Coakley, but when it was announced that somebody close to the mayor was going to be doing this investigation, it did

1041
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:38,303
[SPEAKER_11]: I was a little upset with that, and I felt like it was a slap in the face to everybody that lives in this community.

1042
01:29:39,924 --> 01:29:40,785
[SPEAKER_11]: We're smarter than that.

1043
01:29:41,145 --> 01:29:42,245
[SPEAKER_11]: The people are smarter than that.

1044
01:29:42,666 --> 01:29:55,573
[SPEAKER_11]: We know the mayor wants to come out in a good light after all this, but hiring a consultant that is donated to your campaign and who lives in the city and who endorsed your campaign, I just don't think that's right.

1045
01:29:56,053 --> 01:30:02,016
[SPEAKER_11]: If we wanted to have an outside consultant investigate this, whether or not we want to have that, I think it's something that needs to be discussed

1046
01:30:02,592 --> 01:30:04,553
[SPEAKER_11]: live with the entire school committee.

1047
01:30:04,573 --> 01:30:16,739
[SPEAKER_11]: I would love for the council to be present as well, because we will be the ones eventually approving the budget or improving any additional funding that's needed, whether that be in the school department or the city budget.

1048
01:30:17,660 --> 01:30:23,463
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'd like to know, I thought this was supposed to start yesterday, from what it said on the news.

1049
01:30:23,603 --> 01:30:26,924
[SPEAKER_11]: But I just would like to know how this was decided.

1050
01:30:27,705 --> 01:30:32,067
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to put a resolution in to see if any money has been expended to date.

1051
01:30:32,660 --> 01:30:40,302
[SPEAKER_11]: to start this investigation, and how long it's going to take, who is consulted, was there a public vote?

1052
01:30:40,522 --> 01:30:45,464
[SPEAKER_11]: There was definitely not a school committee meeting before the Wednesday press conference.

1053
01:30:46,244 --> 01:30:48,805
[SPEAKER_11]: So there are a whole host of issues that I personally have.

1054
01:30:48,885 --> 01:30:53,146
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'd like to ask that question, how much has been expended?

1055
01:30:53,166 --> 01:31:00,989
[SPEAKER_11]: I will have a hard time voting for any budget if we're hiring a consultant where there's an appearance of a conflict of interest.

1056
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:06,962
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd also like to ask our city solicitor with regards to how do we find out if this is a conflict of interest?

1057
01:31:07,002 --> 01:31:19,568
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we need to call state ethics or do, or I'm putting a resolution forward that we, that the city council be updated on how much has been expended or will be expended to hire this consultant.

1058
01:31:22,469 --> 01:31:23,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1059
01:31:26,390 --> 01:31:30,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to take, uh, Mr. Penton's paper, uh, receive it in place on file.

1060
01:31:31,592 --> 01:31:32,092
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks.

1061
01:31:33,353 --> 01:31:37,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's finish up this paper and then Councilor Wong-O'Karn can make her resolution.

1062
01:31:38,776 --> 01:31:40,597
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Dela Rousseff.

1063
01:31:40,617 --> 01:31:41,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks, excuse me.

1064
01:31:42,758 --> 01:31:43,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1065
01:31:43,739 --> 01:31:47,981
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank the gentleman and the young lady for speaking.

1066
01:31:48,342 --> 01:31:49,842
[SPEAKER_02]: They brought up some very valid points.

1067
01:31:50,523 --> 01:31:54,265
[SPEAKER_02]: I too have the same concerns as my council colleague has mentioned.

1068
01:31:55,085 --> 01:31:59,788
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just recently, Mr. President, that this council took some

1069
01:32:00,379 --> 01:32:13,005
[SPEAKER_02]: a pretty big action to go against a potential development on Locust Street and to help alleviate some concerns that Director Butters had as well as neighbors in an area.

1070
01:32:13,505 --> 01:32:18,468
[SPEAKER_02]: And we went as far as to ask for outside legal counsel to help us with an issue.

1071
01:32:19,168 --> 01:32:26,051
[SPEAKER_02]: And we got to a point right now that the mayor just sent out a correspondent saying she no longer is going to fund that outside counsel.

1072
01:32:26,811 --> 01:32:29,853
[SPEAKER_02]: And here we have the mayor going off on her own

1073
01:32:30,393 --> 01:32:36,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Because as far as I know, the school committee met in the committee of the whole or whatever you want to call it.

1074
01:32:36,714 --> 01:32:38,494
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't take formal votes there.

1075
01:32:38,914 --> 01:32:40,255
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like us in the committee of the whole.

1076
01:32:40,675 --> 01:32:42,135
[SPEAKER_02]: We could take a vote in the committee of the whole.

1077
01:32:42,455 --> 01:32:44,895
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to come out on the floor for a formal vote.

1078
01:32:45,396 --> 01:32:47,816
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as I know, that never took place with the school committee.

1079
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:51,397
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think they're following their own procedures and protocol.

1080
01:32:51,737 --> 01:32:59,378
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know how the mayor can unilaterally make a decision to hire someone without going through the proper procurement laws

1081
01:32:59,758 --> 01:33:01,239
[SPEAKER_02]: and so forth that are requirements.

1082
01:33:01,639 --> 01:33:03,920
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know if anyone has been hired, officially.

1083
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:05,780
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all hearsay.

1084
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:08,981
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I saw it on the news on several stations.

1085
01:33:09,262 --> 01:33:15,624
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't seen anything that officially says that there's been a hire, so again... It would be nice, Mr. President,

1086
01:33:18,163 --> 01:33:27,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think the mayor may have stated it as it was just mentioned, but it would be nice, what's going on in this community, to get some type of correspondence.

1087
01:33:28,045 --> 01:33:33,066
[SPEAKER_02]: Wouldn't that be nice for the mayor to reach out to the council and say, hey, this is what we're doing.

1088
01:33:33,106 --> 01:33:35,066
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what's happening in the community.

1089
01:33:35,326 --> 01:33:36,266
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what we're doing.

1090
01:33:36,306 --> 01:33:37,687
[SPEAKER_02]: We just had a sweep.

1091
01:33:37,727 --> 01:33:44,948
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing X, Y, and Z. Not one correspondence in the last 12 days from this mayor to this elected body.

1092
01:33:45,708 --> 01:33:48,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe someone else received it, and if they did, they could step forward.

1093
01:33:48,851 --> 01:33:51,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Not one correspondence, Mr. President.

1094
01:33:51,413 --> 01:33:53,995
[SPEAKER_02]: But then again, we hear leadership that works.

1095
01:33:54,075 --> 01:33:56,777
[SPEAKER_02]: We hear this and that coming from the administration.

1096
01:33:57,538 --> 01:34:01,601
[SPEAKER_02]: And this administration does not correspond with us, Mr. President.

1097
01:34:02,542 --> 01:34:07,506
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a telltale sign of a government that's going in the wrong direction, let me tell you.

1098
01:34:07,566 --> 01:34:10,428
[SPEAKER_02]: So... Point of information, Council Member Kern.

1099
01:34:10,915 --> 01:34:12,196
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, President Carviello.

1100
01:34:12,216 --> 01:34:23,600
[SPEAKER_11]: I think on top of that, not only has she not reached out to the entire council, the administration, I personally was the one told by multiple people what happened on Thursday the 15th.

1101
01:34:23,740 --> 01:34:26,861
[SPEAKER_11]: I reported it to the police, Councilor Pinter, on the 16th at 9 a.m.

1102
01:34:27,482 --> 01:34:33,304
[SPEAKER_11]: But I sent the school committee an email, the school committee and the mayor, an email at 6 a.m.

1103
01:34:33,524 --> 01:34:34,284
[SPEAKER_11]: last Tuesday.

1104
01:34:34,965 --> 01:34:40,427
[SPEAKER_11]: Every school committee member has reached out to me, whether that just be a one-liner or a phone call,

1105
01:34:40,962 --> 01:34:42,703
[SPEAKER_11]: except Mayor Burke.

1106
01:34:43,523 --> 01:34:49,045
[SPEAKER_11]: She's not even called me to ask what happened, what's going on, what can we do to fix this?

1107
01:34:49,565 --> 01:34:54,466
[SPEAKER_11]: I've yet to even receive a one line email saying thank you for the update.

1108
01:34:57,127 --> 01:34:57,667
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Mox.

1109
01:34:59,628 --> 01:35:00,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1110
01:35:01,228 --> 01:35:03,069
[SPEAKER_02]: I stated what I had to state, Mr. President.

1111
01:35:03,509 --> 01:35:06,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I'd like to see to the answers, uh, that, uh,

1112
01:35:07,157 --> 01:35:16,209
[SPEAKER_02]: former Councilor Penter and Councilor Longo asked for, so I would ask that be in the form of a motion, Mr. President, that we send that to the city administration.

1113
01:35:17,931 --> 01:35:18,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1114
01:35:21,456 --> 01:35:22,998
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to take papers under suspension.

1115
01:35:34,342 --> 01:35:40,287
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Councilor DelaRosa to receive and place on file, seconded by Councilor Knight.

1116
01:35:40,327 --> 01:35:40,967
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

1117
01:35:41,708 --> 01:35:42,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

1118
01:35:42,408 --> 01:35:44,089
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to take papers under suspension.

1119
01:35:50,514 --> 01:35:50,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1120
01:35:52,796 --> 01:35:54,077
[SPEAKER_05]: Offered by Councilor Longo Kern.

1121
01:35:59,606 --> 01:36:01,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get, let's finish this up, we have a paper here.

1122
01:36:02,107 --> 01:36:13,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Offered by Councilman Kern, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council be updated with regard to how much has been, how much has been or will be expended for an outside investigation.

1123
01:36:13,114 --> 01:36:24,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it further resolved that we get an opinion as to whether the consultant, as to whether the consultant is legal?

1124
01:36:26,382 --> 01:36:26,862
[SPEAKER_05]: Is ethical.

1125
01:36:28,648 --> 01:36:29,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Council Member O'Kane.

1126
01:36:30,429 --> 01:36:34,150
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, that we get an opinion either from state ethics or from our city solicitor.

1127
01:36:34,191 --> 01:36:35,191
[SPEAKER_05]: An ethical opinion.

1128
01:36:35,391 --> 01:36:37,652
[SPEAKER_11]: An ethical opinion, whether or not this is ethical.

1129
01:36:38,332 --> 01:36:42,494
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd go one step further, I don't know if I'll have the votes tonight, to say we hire somebody independent.

1130
01:36:43,995 --> 01:36:55,180
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, nothing wrong with Martha Coakley, it's just such an appearance of a conflict of interest that I don't feel comfortable, nor do the many people that have emailed or called me about this one issue alone.

1131
01:36:55,601 --> 01:37:13,235
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would take that one step further and say that if we're going to do an investigation and the school committee wants to vote on that, that we either go out to bid or we use a consultant or attorney that has no connections to the city of Medford, just like we did for when we hired an attorney for the Locust Street development.

1132
01:37:13,936 --> 01:37:15,877
[SPEAKER_11]: None of us knew of him whatsoever.

1133
01:37:15,957 --> 01:37:18,499
[SPEAKER_11]: And we did it with transparency.

1134
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:20,141
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's the way this needs to be done.

1135
01:37:20,821 --> 01:37:21,122
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1136
01:37:21,662 --> 01:37:22,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Counselor Knight.

1137
01:37:22,683 --> 01:37:23,944
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to refer to the school committee, Mr. President.

1138
01:37:27,983 --> 01:37:32,404
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Councilor Knight to refer this paper to the school committee.

1139
01:37:34,584 --> 01:37:39,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you just have the clerk read it one more time, please?

1140
01:37:39,625 --> 01:37:41,406
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if we have the authority.

1141
01:37:41,886 --> 01:37:43,086
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a school committee matter.

1142
01:37:43,106 --> 01:37:47,507
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I agree with Councilor Longo's motion here, but it is a school committee matter.

1143
01:37:48,688 --> 01:37:50,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, be it resolved.

1144
01:37:51,218 --> 01:37:57,800
[SPEAKER_05]: The Memphis City Council will be updated with regard to how much has been or will be expended for an outside investigation.

1145
01:37:57,840 --> 01:38:02,922
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it further resolved that we get an ethical opinion on the consultants.

1146
01:38:05,322 --> 01:38:05,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilman.

1147
01:38:06,603 --> 01:38:11,604
[SPEAKER_02]: If the school committee never formally voted on it, how is it a school committee matter?

1148
01:38:11,764 --> 01:38:16,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, this is all, again, I don't have any paper saying that anyone has been hired.

1149
01:38:17,768 --> 01:38:21,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, because the mayor hasn't communicated with us, that's why we're trying to get answers.

1150
01:38:21,172 --> 01:38:22,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, I don't know if anyone was hired, so.

1151
01:38:22,834 --> 01:38:29,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, so I would recommend that this, or make a motion to be sent to the city administration, as well as the school committee.

1152
01:38:30,783 --> 01:38:31,303
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President.

1153
01:38:31,724 --> 01:38:32,785
[SPEAKER_16]: Let me address the record, please.

1154
01:38:32,925 --> 01:38:34,166
[SPEAKER_16]: Zero Summit Road, Barpenta.

1155
01:38:34,647 --> 01:38:35,027
[SPEAKER_16]: Number one,

1156
01:38:36,317 --> 01:38:42,399
[SPEAKER_16]: As outlined in the local press and in the Boston news media, she was hired, Martha Coakley was hired by the mayor.

1157
01:38:42,779 --> 01:38:45,500
[SPEAKER_16]: This vote never took place, it was never presented before the school committee.

1158
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:46,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, again, that's, again.

1159
01:38:46,301 --> 01:38:50,902
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, wait a minute, I'm just telling you, if you can check it out, it was never presented before the, it was never presented.

1160
01:38:50,922 --> 01:38:52,123
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have any paperwork to say that.

1161
01:38:52,143 --> 01:38:54,364
[SPEAKER_16]: It was never presented, Rick, before the school committee.

1162
01:38:54,384 --> 01:38:55,364
[SPEAKER_16]: There's no official vote.

1163
01:38:55,384 --> 01:38:56,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, so we don't know if anyone's ever been hired.

1164
01:38:57,105 --> 01:38:58,165
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, that's all hearsay.

1165
01:38:59,413 --> 01:39:04,014
[SPEAKER_16]: If it's hearsay, never mind.

1166
01:39:04,395 --> 01:39:10,416
[SPEAKER_16]: Can I ask you to amend the resolution that reads, well, maybe you don't like it.

1167
01:39:10,456 --> 01:39:11,657
[SPEAKER_16]: You can leave if you're bored.

1168
01:39:12,777 --> 01:39:15,118
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe you can ask the question that

1169
01:39:15,815 --> 01:39:26,437
[SPEAKER_16]: You're concerned about the ethics of it because of the fact of the financial contributions she has made to the mayor, and that in and of itself presents a conflict of interest.

1170
01:39:26,517 --> 01:39:30,538
[SPEAKER_16]: The appearance of a conflict of interest, that's what 268A says.

1171
01:39:33,018 --> 01:39:33,818
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what we're asking for.

1172
01:39:35,439 --> 01:39:37,199
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think you sometimes have to be definitive.

1173
01:39:38,839 --> 01:39:41,900
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're asking for an opinion that said, counsel?

1174
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:43,500
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I think that's,

1175
01:39:44,267 --> 01:39:45,407
[SPEAKER_11]: definitely needs to be stated.

1176
01:39:45,427 --> 01:39:53,450
[SPEAKER_11]: I think our city solicitor needs to review this, figure out if he can give us an opinion with regards to the financial contribution and the endorsement of the campaign.

1177
01:39:53,991 --> 01:39:59,313
[SPEAKER_11]: And if he can't, then state ethics needs to give the school committee in the city of Medford the decision.

1178
01:39:59,673 --> 01:40:01,694
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that should be public knowledge.

1179
01:40:01,974 --> 01:40:07,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, this board has not been notified of anyone being hired, so we don't know.

1180
01:40:07,436 --> 01:40:08,856
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was at, through the chair.

1181
01:40:08,876 --> 01:40:10,137
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, please, Mr. President.

1182
01:40:11,807 --> 01:40:17,289
[SPEAKER_02]: With all due respect, with all due respect about notification, we weren't even notified that there was a magazine found in the school.

1183
01:40:17,769 --> 01:40:19,009
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're saying that's not true?

1184
01:40:19,849 --> 01:40:22,390
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, the notification thing is out the window.

1185
01:40:23,070 --> 01:40:25,711
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we haven't been notified from day one on anything.

1186
01:40:26,391 --> 01:40:32,093
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have to believe when I hear the mayor say she hired Martha Coakley, when I read in the paper, when I see it on the local news.

1187
01:40:32,153 --> 01:40:33,593
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know of any cost or anything.

1188
01:40:33,673 --> 01:40:35,494
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to, you're right, we don't know that.

1189
01:40:35,514 --> 01:40:36,534
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we're asking the question.

1190
01:40:36,794 --> 01:40:39,895
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have to believe there's some truth to it when I see it in all these,

1191
01:40:40,315 --> 01:40:42,456
[SPEAKER_02]: different media venues.

1192
01:40:42,876 --> 01:40:43,576
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to believe this.

1193
01:40:43,596 --> 01:40:44,216
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm true to it.

1194
01:40:44,636 --> 01:40:49,257
[SPEAKER_11]: And through the chair, I was at the press conference and it wasn't, it wasn't a secret.

1195
01:40:49,297 --> 01:40:54,298
[SPEAKER_11]: The mayor said, I've hired Martha Coakley to do an independent investigation beginning immediately.

1196
01:40:54,318 --> 01:41:05,681
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the words were, so we know that either whether the check has been written and the process has started, it would lead one to believe that it was said Wednesday and immediately would be Thursday, Friday, Monday, Tuesday.

1197
01:41:05,781 --> 01:41:09,582
[SPEAKER_11]: So we, we are under the impression, the city is under the impression that this investigation

1198
01:41:10,005 --> 01:41:19,912
[SPEAKER_11]: probably has started and I would like to know how much has been expended and to halt that so we can go out to bid and do it the right way by an independent party that has no dealings with the city of Medford.

1199
01:41:19,932 --> 01:41:20,373
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1200
01:41:20,813 --> 01:41:32,381
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, just as a point of reference, on February 23rd it was written in the Boston Herald and where the mayor is quoted as saying that Martha Coakley is now an employee being hired.

1201
01:41:32,401 --> 01:41:32,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

1202
01:41:33,546 --> 01:41:36,687
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a motion on the floor by Councilor Langel-Kern.

1203
01:41:37,667 --> 01:41:41,849
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Councilor Langel-Kern, seconded by Councilor Marks.

1204
01:41:43,849 --> 01:41:44,590
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

1205
01:41:47,771 --> 01:41:48,911
[SPEAKER_05]: The chair seems to be in doubt.

1206
01:41:48,931 --> 01:41:50,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1207
01:41:55,373 --> 01:41:58,034
[SPEAKER_05]: We are sending a resolution by Councilor Langel-Kern.

1208
01:42:04,796 --> 01:42:13,504
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, we're not talking about okay, mr. Clark, please call the roll Yes

1209
01:42:27,920 --> 01:42:29,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Five in the affirmative, two in the negative.

1210
01:42:29,822 --> 01:42:30,662
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

1211
01:42:31,263 --> 01:42:31,623
[SPEAKER_05]: Records.

1212
01:42:32,764 --> 01:42:35,646
[SPEAKER_05]: Tabled records of the meeting of February 6th will pass to Councilor Mox.

1213
01:42:36,046 --> 01:42:36,607
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Mox.

1214
01:42:42,091 --> 01:42:42,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Excuse me.

1215
01:42:43,052 --> 01:42:46,635
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Falco.

1216
01:42:46,935 --> 01:42:47,736
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1217
01:42:47,756 --> 01:42:49,177
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wanted to make a quick announcement.

1218
01:42:49,997 --> 01:42:55,782
[SPEAKER_12]: Tomorrow night, the ad hoc subcommittee to the Malden Hospital site development will be meeting at St.

1219
01:42:55,822 --> 01:42:56,883
[SPEAKER_12]: Francis Parish Center.

1220
01:42:57,524 --> 01:43:06,269
[SPEAKER_12]: It's 6 p.m., and we will be meeting also with the Maldon Hospital ad hoc committee from the Maldon City Council.

1221
01:43:06,329 --> 01:43:07,169
[SPEAKER_12]: And what is that meeting again?

1222
01:43:07,489 --> 01:43:07,710
