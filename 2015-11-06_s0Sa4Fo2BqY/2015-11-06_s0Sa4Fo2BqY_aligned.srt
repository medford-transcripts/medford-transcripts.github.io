00:00:04,287 --> 00:00:05,988
Hi, and welcome to the Mustang Report.

2
00:00:06,348 --> 00:00:28,035
This Mustang Report will be featuring a preview of the Eric Farazani Faculty Flag Football Game, an interview with Heidi Riccio, the director of the Vocational High School, an interview with the National Honor Society members, clips and interviews of Medford's own veterans, the amazing shootout victory of the boys soccer team in the state tournament,

3
00:01:19,802 --> 00:01:23,263
So could you tell me a little bit about the open house this upcoming Tuesday?

4
00:01:24,043 --> 00:01:24,403
Sure.

5
00:01:24,423 --> 00:01:38,007
What differs from the vocational school's open house to the high school's open house is that the high school open house focuses on the academic side of our programs, but the vocational open house focuses on the career and technical education programs.

6
00:01:38,827 --> 00:01:42,288
So do your students facilitate this open house?

7
00:01:42,328 --> 00:01:45,349
Do they show the other upcoming 7th and 8th graders around?

8
00:01:46,095 --> 00:01:46,675
Absolutely.

9
00:01:46,755 --> 00:01:54,560
So we'll have tours going on, we'll have different activities in each of the programs happening that will be completely run by our students.

10
00:01:55,441 --> 00:01:59,663
So, I just said it, but this open house, is it for just 7th and 8th graders?

11
00:02:00,784 --> 00:02:05,447
It's an open house where we obviously invite the community in, so any community member can come.

12
00:02:05,647 --> 00:02:07,128
It's from 6 to 8 p.m.

13
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:09,089
on November 12th, next Thursday.

14
00:02:09,603 --> 00:02:18,305
We'd love to have the community in because we will also be dedicating our new health assisting lab and thanking all of the donors that helped us move that along.

15
00:02:18,325 --> 00:02:23,066
Can you tell me about what National Honor Society is and what you guys do for National Honor Society?

16
00:02:23,266 --> 00:02:32,348
So National Honor Society is a cohort of students and we're dedicated to giving back to community and currently we're focusing on high school so far so it's been nice.

17
00:02:33,348 --> 00:02:37,772
So I know you guys recently did a Tenoch food truck fundraiser, so can you tell me a little bit about that?

18
00:02:38,213 --> 00:02:49,624
Yes, so we asked Tenoch to come over for during one of the half days and basically we had a pre-order session where people just came during lunch and order what they wanted for

19
00:02:50,634 --> 00:03:09,685
from Chinooch and then $10 was the cost and then $2 comes to us and $8 goes to Chinooch and we raised over $200 so it was a that's going to contribute to our phone book initiative which is going to help us get laptops for our tutoring service that we offer to the school.

20
00:03:10,085 --> 00:03:16,589
So can you tell me about the after school I know the National Honor Society does tutoring so can you tell me a little bit about that so the students know?

21
00:03:17,059 --> 00:03:20,906
So our program is called How to Survive High School 101, and it's not just tutoring.

22
00:03:20,946 --> 00:03:22,369
It's also networking service.

23
00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:28,060
So we have a whole database and whole list of community service opportunities, jobs, internships.

24
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:39,158
that are offered to the school, and we're, our hope is that over the years it's gonna grow and grow and grow, and then other kids can use it year after year.

25
00:03:39,578 --> 00:03:46,281
And then our last one would be just advice, like anything that they have questions about, whether it's school out of school, anything like that.

26
00:03:47,842 --> 00:03:51,423
We're currently in lecture hall three, but we'll be moving down to the library.

27
00:03:52,003 --> 00:03:56,145
Same services, we'll be supportive no matter what, so it's exciting.

28
00:03:56,777 --> 00:04:00,218
I'll be there in December on Monday, so thanks for telling time.

29
00:04:00,258 --> 00:04:01,578
Have a great rest of the year.

30
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:09,540
Mr. Kane, how did you get involved in getting the veterans to come to the high school?

31
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:16,661
Well, this is my 12th year as a social studies teacher, and every year that I've been here, I've had veterans come in on Veterans Day as part of this program.

32
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:22,542
So last year, I had the opportunity to help coordinate the program, so this is the second year doing that.

33
00:04:22,582 --> 00:04:26,283
It's a wonderful program to help connect social studies with the local community.

34
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,040
Awesome.

35
00:04:29,461 --> 00:04:33,424
And what do these veterans serve as coming to the high school and educating students on what they do?

36
00:04:34,624 --> 00:04:40,208
It's an amazing resource that we have them volunteering their time to come in to celebrate Veterans Day.

37
00:04:40,909 --> 00:04:48,995
It's something that we see on the calendar, but it's something that needs to be made real to students, the service of people, local people in the community for their country.

38
00:04:50,016 --> 00:04:52,998
Do you think the veterans coming here encourage students to go into the military?

39
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,324
I think it depends on the student and so to some it may and to some it might discourage them.

40
00:04:58,944 --> 00:05:01,006
That's not really the idea of this program though.

41
00:05:01,026 --> 00:05:08,532
This program is to look at Veterans Day and what it means to us as a country and also what it means to us as a community.

42
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:09,693
Awesome.

43
00:05:10,193 --> 00:05:12,195
And what branches of the military do we have here today?

44
00:05:12,795 --> 00:05:14,817
I believe we have all branches represented today.

45
00:05:15,517 --> 00:05:15,818
Awesome.

46
00:05:16,298 --> 00:05:19,741
And some are veterans from beforehand and they're out and some are currently enlisted?

47
00:05:20,128 --> 00:05:20,868
Absolutely, yeah.

48
00:05:20,888 --> 00:05:23,269
We have some, yeah, absolutely.

49
00:05:23,749 --> 00:05:24,069
Awesome.

50
00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:27,590
And what is your opinion on the veterans of this country?

51
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:33,691
Oh, I think the service that they offer the country is something that you really can't put a measure on.

52
00:05:35,392 --> 00:05:37,232
And it's something that we should all be thankful for.

53
00:05:37,972 --> 00:05:40,233
This is Lydia Ryan reporting from the Mustang Report.

54
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:43,394
And we are here with two former Medford High students for Veterans Day.

55
00:05:43,974 --> 00:05:46,014
I understand you guys were former Medford High students.

56
00:05:46,834 --> 00:05:48,695
What was your time here at Medford High School like?

57
00:05:49,646 --> 00:05:53,810
My time was 1972, I graduated from Meffitt High.

58
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:54,891
I was actually a Vogue student.

59
00:05:57,613 --> 00:06:01,476
I was the second class actually to graduate out of this new school.

60
00:06:03,358 --> 00:06:06,161
And I graduated in 98 from Meffitt High.

61
00:06:06,181 --> 00:06:07,862
I did a little time in the Vogue too.

62
00:06:08,903 --> 00:06:09,203
Awesome.

63
00:06:09,423 --> 00:06:11,625
Did you go straight into the military right after high school?

64
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:12,746
Yes, I did.

65
00:06:14,148 --> 00:06:16,790
I went to Norwich after high school.

66
00:06:17,548 --> 00:06:19,670
And then I went into the Marines.

67
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:20,590
Awesome.

68
00:06:20,871 --> 00:06:22,472
What branch of the service did you go into?

69
00:06:22,492 --> 00:06:24,153
I was in the United States Marine Corps.

70
00:06:25,314 --> 00:06:26,154
I'm in the same service.

71
00:06:26,415 --> 00:06:27,055
In the Marines.

72
00:06:28,196 --> 00:06:29,637
How long did you spend in the Marine Corps?

73
00:06:30,077 --> 00:06:31,018
I spent five years, 1972 to 1977.

74
00:06:31,098 --> 00:06:32,099
I spent 17 years, 99 to right now.

75
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:39,871
I learned a lot.

76
00:06:39,911 --> 00:06:43,833
It was a very rewarding experience.

77
00:06:44,114 --> 00:06:48,196
I got to go places that everybody doesn't get to go.

78
00:06:48,216 --> 00:06:50,878
I learned a lot.

79
00:06:51,938 --> 00:06:58,962
I got to see some beautiful, beautiful places in this world that I never thought I would get to go.

80
00:07:00,663 --> 00:07:02,805
I got a lot of experience and a lot of good schooling.

81
00:07:03,835 --> 00:07:09,137
out of six years in the Marine Corps, which helped me further in my life.

82
00:07:09,257 --> 00:07:13,959
I got out of the Marine Corps and I was a police officer in L.A., and that helped me.

83
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:19,701
My military experience helped me when I was a police officer, so it was pretty cool.

84
00:07:20,762 --> 00:07:24,283
Hi, this is Lydia Ryan with the Mustang Report, and we're here on Veterans Day.

85
00:07:24,723 --> 00:07:25,563
Hi, what's your name?

86
00:07:26,064 --> 00:07:27,724
My name is Sasarn Zee with the Marines.

87
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:29,245
And what is your status?

88
00:07:30,246 --> 00:07:32,007
My current status right now is active duty.

89
00:07:32,487 --> 00:07:34,708
I'm actually the recruiter out of Boston in Medford Square.

90
00:07:34,728 --> 00:07:36,048
Oh, awesome.

91
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:37,648
Did you grow up locally around here?

92
00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:38,429
I did not.

93
00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:40,169
I'm actually from New York originally.

94
00:07:40,409 --> 00:07:40,889
Go Yankees.

95
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:42,030
No.

96
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:42,790
No.

97
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:44,131
Go Sox.

98
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:46,731
What made you go into the military?

99
00:07:46,751 --> 00:07:50,072
I enlisted for quite a few different reasons.

100
00:07:50,953 --> 00:07:52,853
Most importantly, I wanted to serve my country.

101
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:56,815
And I felt the best way to do that was to enlist in the Marine Corps.

102
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:04,522
I lost family in the World Trade Center, so that was definitely something that inspired me to actually take that step into enlisting.

103
00:08:07,743 --> 00:08:09,243
How many years were you in the military?

104
00:08:09,824 --> 00:08:11,684
I have been in for over 11 years now.

105
00:08:12,965 --> 00:08:15,025
Are you still currently in the military?

106
00:08:15,705 --> 00:08:17,566
Yes, I'm currently active duty.

107
00:08:18,046 --> 00:08:20,487
I work out of Medford Square in downtown Boston.

108
00:08:24,053 --> 00:08:29,457
We didn't have iPhones back then, we had a camera with film, so you had to get the camera and take pictures, so I took a picture.

109
00:08:29,617 --> 00:08:34,520
We're up north, so up north, there's a lot of mountains, terrain, you'll see the terrain.

110
00:08:35,721 --> 00:08:46,508
Typical village, you come across, you walk through a jungle, come across a village, a hut, a couple of huts, so you have to go through, make sure there's no bad guys on any arms or anything like that.

111
00:08:46,528 --> 00:08:47,509
Typical village.

112
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:51,672
That's me, I used to carry,

113
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,451
Forty-five, and I carried an M-16.

114
00:08:54,471 --> 00:08:58,173
Carried probably about 200 rounds of ammunition on me.

115
00:08:58,233 --> 00:08:59,934
Bayonet, grenades, things like that.

116
00:09:00,314 --> 00:09:00,894
Intelligence.

117
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:03,715
So I was an intelligence officer for about four years.

118
00:09:03,735 --> 00:09:07,017
Went down to a tech school down in Texas, out in the middle of nowhere.

119
00:09:07,037 --> 00:09:10,939
I don't know if you've ever heard of Goodfellow Air Force Base or Goodfellow, Texas.

120
00:09:10,979 --> 00:09:15,741
It's literally in the middle of Texas, about three hours away from civilization.

121
00:09:15,761 --> 00:09:17,502
Absolutely nothing to do.

122
00:09:18,403 --> 00:09:20,604
So I was out there for about a year.

123
00:09:22,409 --> 00:09:25,718
stationed out at Beale Air Force Base in Sacramento, California.

124
00:09:26,821 --> 00:09:28,666
So you had to be prepared for that.

125
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:30,912
Luckily the colonel

126
00:09:54,955 --> 00:10:00,016
because I believe in the principles of fighting for your own country.

127
00:10:05,077 --> 00:10:17,440
This is Nick Keniston from the Mustang Report, and I am here up at the Field of Dreams where yesterday Medford Mustangs varsity soccer team defeated Acton-Boxborough 3-2 in the PK shootout.

128
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:19,300
Jordan Howard,

129
00:10:20,273 --> 00:10:25,555
Normally a defender, showed his versatility yesterday in the PK shootout, scored the final goal for Medford.

130
00:10:26,155 --> 00:10:37,120
Sammy Reed, in his first ever game for the Medford Mustangs, filling in for an injured Mateo Cunha, normally the starter, Sammy Reed filled in, made some spectacular saves throughout the game.

131
00:10:53,463 --> 00:10:59,948
And the Mustangs now will move on to the quarterfinals against Malden at McDonald's Stadium on Monday at 6 p.m.

132
00:11:00,748 --> 00:11:04,290
Every Mustang should be there showing their pride for this Mustang soccer team.

133
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:32,556
Speeding off to left.

134
00:12:17,892 --> 00:12:18,533
Drink it.

135
00:13:09,382 --> 00:13:10,353
Yes, middle, middle.
