00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,622
[SPEAKER_15]: The 36th regular meeting of the Medford City Council will come to order.

2
00:00:06,642 --> 00:00:07,663
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

3
00:00:07,683 --> 00:00:07,963
[SPEAKER_15]: Present.

[SPEAKER_15]: Seven members present.

[SPEAKER_15]: None absent, please rise to salute the flag.

6
00:00:11,606 --> 00:00:11,666
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

7
00:00:45,185 --> 00:00:50,168
[SPEAKER_15]: The two councilors-elect, John Falco and George Scarpelli, are with us tonight.

8
00:00:50,689 --> 00:00:53,651
[SPEAKER_15]: We invite them to join us behind the rail.

9
00:00:53,671 --> 00:00:54,471
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilors-elect.

10
00:00:54,491 --> 00:01:05,798
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a glorious seating for you over there.

11
00:01:12,983 --> 00:01:13,383
[SPEAKER_15]: Welcome.

12
00:01:13,825 --> 00:01:18,427
[SPEAKER_15]: And the chair recognizes Councilor Knight for a request to suspension of the rules.

13
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:19,388
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Knight.

14
00:01:19,828 --> 00:01:31,193
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, I move to take paper 15-432 off the table out of unfinished business to allow MassDOT and its contractor, Zippo and Company, to provide an update on the reconstruction of the Craddock Bridge, please.

15
00:01:31,753 --> 00:01:32,133
[SPEAKER_15]: Very good.

16
00:01:32,173 --> 00:01:39,177
[SPEAKER_15]: So for the motion for suspension of the rules to take 15-432 off the table for discussion.

17
00:01:39,197 --> 00:01:39,897
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

18
00:01:40,483 --> 00:01:42,065
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed, motion carries.

19
00:01:43,206 --> 00:01:52,795
[SPEAKER_15]: Meeting dash 432, request for Massachusetts Department of Transportation to present themselves, to give an update on the construction project.

20
00:01:53,368 --> 00:02:00,350
[SPEAKER_15]: at the Craddock Bridge, and also to address issues around communication and bus stops.

21
00:02:01,771 --> 00:02:07,872
[SPEAKER_15]: Chair recognizes the gentleman at the podium, who is the man in charge of bridges, I believe.

22
00:02:08,233 --> 00:02:08,493
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes?

23
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:14,014
[SPEAKER_08]: Scott Kelleway, District 4 Construction, and in charge of the Accelerator Bridge Program.

24
00:02:14,034 --> 00:02:14,514
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

25
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:14,955
[SPEAKER_08]: Very good.

26
00:02:15,215 --> 00:02:15,535
[SPEAKER_15]: Welcome.

27
00:02:16,155 --> 00:02:16,455
[SPEAKER_15]: Welcome.

28
00:02:16,475 --> 00:02:16,695
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

29
00:02:16,715 --> 00:02:20,276
[SPEAKER_15]: And Merry Christmas to everyone, and our beautiful winter wonderland.

30
00:02:21,296 --> 00:02:21,497
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes?

31
00:02:21,777 --> 00:02:22,797
[SPEAKER_15]: Department of Transportation.

32
00:02:24,723 --> 00:02:28,385
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, again, I was asked to provide a briefing.

33
00:02:28,466 --> 00:02:33,829
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll roll right into that as short, as briefly as possible.

34
00:02:33,889 --> 00:02:39,353
[SPEAKER_08]: My project right now is 23% complete.

35
00:02:39,633 --> 00:02:50,120
[SPEAKER_08]: Short-term look ahead, what you'll be seeing over the next few weeks, we'll be focusing, continuing to focus on the installation of the temporary bridge.

36
00:02:51,059 --> 00:03:06,165
[SPEAKER_08]: This will be followed with the roadway tie-ins to that temporary bridge, and then we will, that bridge will eventually carry northbound traffic into Clipper Ship Drive.

37
00:03:07,265 --> 00:03:10,226
[SPEAKER_08]: We're planning on progressing that over the next couple of weeks.

38
00:03:10,286 --> 00:03:14,588
[SPEAKER_08]: We're hoping to have that bridge open by mid to late December.

39
00:03:16,189 --> 00:03:19,230
[SPEAKER_08]: That's currently our goal, and we're looking pretty good for that.

40
00:03:21,445 --> 00:03:29,547
[SPEAKER_08]: Then we're going to, to tie all this in, we're going to have to get new crosswalks going to establish the phase three work zone.

41
00:03:30,747 --> 00:03:33,668
[SPEAKER_08]: That will be phase three traffic switch.

42
00:03:33,728 --> 00:03:39,269
[SPEAKER_08]: That will allow us to start work on the eastern portion of the bridge, of the existing bridge.

43
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:46,051
[SPEAKER_08]: To do that, we're going to have to install crosswalks, line painting, barrier installation.

44
00:03:46,391 --> 00:03:49,572
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to have to relocate that bus stop in front of the restaurant.

45
00:03:50,358 --> 00:03:56,502
[SPEAKER_08]: We're gonna have to get the traffic signals active, temporary traffic signals active.

46
00:03:57,603 --> 00:04:01,946
[SPEAKER_08]: Along with this, national grid relocation work will be concurrent with that work.

47
00:04:03,287 --> 00:04:12,913
[SPEAKER_08]: Once the temp bridge is open and we're in the phase three configuration, we're gonna begin the demolition and rehabilitation of that eastern portion of the bridge.

48
00:04:13,213 --> 00:04:16,696
[SPEAKER_08]: That's full demolition of the super end substructure.

49
00:04:18,277 --> 00:04:19,358
[SPEAKER_08]: We're gonna have to enclose the,

50
00:04:20,748 --> 00:04:23,289
[SPEAKER_08]: in water portion in cofferdams.

51
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:31,992
[SPEAKER_08]: We're gonna then start rebuilding the new bridge, new steel beams, new concrete decks.

52
00:04:32,812 --> 00:04:35,893
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be then paving, tying it all in.

53
00:04:36,814 --> 00:04:44,656
[SPEAKER_08]: This will of course begin January, this coming January, and will be complete by September of 2017.

54
00:04:48,377 --> 00:04:53,920
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll then roll into phase four, which will allow us to shift traffic onto the new bridge.

55
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:58,963
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll then begin work on the demolition and reconstruction of the western portion of the bridge.

56
00:05:00,544 --> 00:05:10,531
[SPEAKER_08]: That, very similar to the eastern portion, that'll begin September 2017 and last through August of 2018.

57
00:05:13,272 --> 00:05:17,075
[SPEAKER_08]: That time, we'll pretty much be done with our bridge work.

58
00:05:18,114 --> 00:05:35,364
[SPEAKER_08]: reestablish the islands, reopen the ramp, finish off the job site, and we'll be complete with the project by November of 2018 when everything will be in its normal traffic pattern and everything will return back to normal.

59
00:05:36,084 --> 00:05:36,485
[SPEAKER_08]: Very good.

60
00:05:37,305 --> 00:05:38,126
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

61
00:05:38,526 --> 00:05:39,386
[SPEAKER_15]: That's your synopsis?

62
00:05:39,466 --> 00:05:40,887
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a quick rundown.

63
00:05:40,927 --> 00:05:42,648
[SPEAKER_08]: Be happy to entertain any questions.

64
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,790
[SPEAKER_08]: I do have one question for the council.

65
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:45,410
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

66
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:46,210
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead.

67
00:05:47,898 --> 00:05:48,098
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

68
00:05:48,678 --> 00:05:51,139
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, traffic stop relocation.

69
00:05:51,419 --> 00:06:01,541
[SPEAKER_08]: Last time we spoke, uh, you all wanted to weigh in on the subject of proposed, uh, for a temporary bus, I'm sorry, bus stop relocation.

70
00:06:02,341 --> 00:06:06,602
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, the bus stop in front of the restaurant needs to be relocated cause that's got to become a work zone.

71
00:06:07,722 --> 00:06:12,823
[SPEAKER_08]: So we propose, I'm sorry, that's going to be in part of the,

72
00:06:13,575 --> 00:06:15,036
[SPEAKER_08]: work zone in front of the restaurant.

73
00:06:15,056 --> 00:06:16,377
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to barrier across there.

74
00:06:16,557 --> 00:06:18,979
[SPEAKER_08]: So pedestrians can't get buses, can't get in there.

75
00:06:25,024 --> 00:06:25,284
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

76
00:06:25,765 --> 00:06:37,654
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, we've sent to the council a proposal on three locations and we get into the time that we need a decision on that to the city.

77
00:06:37,994 --> 00:06:40,716
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, that wasn't forwarded to the council.

78
00:06:40,736 --> 00:06:40,876
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

79
00:06:40,896 --> 00:06:41,897
[SPEAKER_08]: It's forwarded to the city.

80
00:06:42,117 --> 00:06:42,718
[SPEAKER_08]: We do need a,

81
00:06:43,741 --> 00:06:45,743
[SPEAKER_15]: decision on that, not to lay work.

82
00:06:45,783 --> 00:06:53,509
[SPEAKER_15]: I think what, um, the gentleman is alluding to is that there was a communication made to the, um, point of information counselor Penter in one second.

83
00:06:53,529 --> 00:06:59,794
[SPEAKER_15]: There was a communication made, uh, from the department of transportation, uh, to the, uh, city.

84
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:12,505
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it was, uh, filtered, uh, through, uh, to the mayor's office and also, uh, to the department of, uh, the developed community development.

85
00:07:13,142 --> 00:07:18,164
[SPEAKER_15]: uh, the, uh, traffic commission, chief of police and the city engineer for response.

86
00:07:18,804 --> 00:07:23,706
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think the, uh, as coordinator of that communication, I think, uh, Ms.

87
00:07:23,766 --> 00:07:38,771
[SPEAKER_15]: DiLorenzo was waiting for a, uh, continued feedback or some feedback from the other offices, uh, to report back to the, uh, uh, department of communication, uh, point of information, council Penta.

88
00:07:39,271 --> 00:07:41,972
[SPEAKER_15]: I also want to, uh, take this opportunity that, uh,

89
00:07:42,466 --> 00:08:04,341
[SPEAKER_15]: Other members of the team representing the Department of Transportation, Mr. Donny Daly, who is the Chief Legislative Liaison of the Department of Transportation, members of Zoppel Construction, and also with us is the Right Honorable Paul J. Donato, State Representative and Leader of the House of Representatives.

90
00:08:06,042 --> 00:08:07,123
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Pinto.

91
00:08:07,143 --> 00:08:07,564
[SPEAKER_23]: Two points.

92
00:08:07,604 --> 00:08:09,125
[SPEAKER_23]: I appreciate the fact that you're here, sir.

93
00:08:10,457 --> 00:08:17,419
[SPEAKER_23]: First of all, I have no idea about this communication that was sent, so I'm assuming one of the reasons why you're here, because the council has asked you folks to be here.

94
00:08:17,979 --> 00:08:25,620
[SPEAKER_23]: We would like to believe that there's been weekly meetings with people in this building, and you folks, and Zappa Construction on the bridge.

95
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:33,222
[SPEAKER_23]: We've been asking for updates, and this was all foreign to us as of a week ago, so the question is, is that true or false?

96
00:08:33,302 --> 00:08:34,802
[SPEAKER_23]: Have you been meeting with people?

97
00:08:34,842 --> 00:08:37,123
[SPEAKER_08]: On this particular project, in this building?

98
00:08:37,203 --> 00:08:37,363
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

99
00:08:38,772 --> 00:08:40,572
[SPEAKER_08]: do not recall building.

100
00:08:40,612 --> 00:08:41,913
[SPEAKER_08]: It hasn't been biweekly.

101
00:08:41,993 --> 00:08:45,073
[SPEAKER_08]: No, we have met at any time upon request.

102
00:08:45,213 --> 00:08:54,276
[SPEAKER_08]: You have a meeting at our field office with, but have you met with another, which the department of public works OCD, anyone like you have, we've been meeting with those representatives biweekly.

103
00:08:54,336 --> 00:08:54,576
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

104
00:08:54,636 --> 00:08:55,156
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

105
00:08:55,356 --> 00:08:57,016
[SPEAKER_23]: At our field office, at your field office.

106
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,516
[SPEAKER_23]: And that's, and that's what we had asked for.

107
00:08:58,536 --> 00:09:00,737
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, we'd asked for updates as it relates to that.

108
00:09:00,817 --> 00:09:04,618
[SPEAKER_23]: And we never got a response back from anybody as it relates to that.

109
00:09:04,638 --> 00:09:04,798
[SPEAKER_23]: Go ahead.

110
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,080
[SPEAKER_19]: Excuse me.

111
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,040
[SPEAKER_19]: My name is Peter Trimontosi.

112
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,601
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm the area engineer on the project.

113
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:12,321
[SPEAKER_19]: Mark Shay does attend our progress meetings as does Dennis McDougal.

114
00:09:13,062 --> 00:09:15,262
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, and Cassandra is invited every single week.

115
00:09:15,982 --> 00:09:18,343
[SPEAKER_19]: So they do send a representative to our five week.

116
00:09:18,383 --> 00:09:18,983
[SPEAKER_23]: That may be them.

117
00:09:19,023 --> 00:09:26,584
[SPEAKER_23]: This is the council wanting to find out because when we get questions asked to us by the taxpayers and the residents and folks that are using the bus stops, we don't have answers.

118
00:09:26,985 --> 00:09:29,845
[SPEAKER_23]: And that's the reason why the sense of frustration has taken place.

119
00:09:29,885 --> 00:09:33,606
[SPEAKER_23]: If you're meeting with them and we're asking for reports and minutes to the meetings, we get nothing.

120
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:35,087
[SPEAKER_23]: because nothing's come back.

121
00:09:35,647 --> 00:09:36,487
[SPEAKER_08]: No, nothing against you.

122
00:09:36,527 --> 00:09:38,789
[SPEAKER_23]: I just want to know you have met with these people.

123
00:09:38,949 --> 00:09:39,569
[SPEAKER_23]: That is correct.

124
00:09:39,589 --> 00:09:39,769
[SPEAKER_23]: Good.

125
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:40,630
[SPEAKER_23]: That's all you need to know.

126
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:41,370
[SPEAKER_23]: That's number one.

127
00:09:41,751 --> 00:09:44,472
[SPEAKER_23]: Number two, as it relates to the issue regarding the bus stop.

128
00:09:44,632 --> 00:09:44,933
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay.

129
00:09:45,493 --> 00:09:56,019
[SPEAKER_23]: Um, again, from further information that's been given to us, and I think the city clerk can attest to the fact the gentleman from the MBTA has indicated he will not come out to a night meeting to discuss bus stops.

130
00:09:56,059 --> 00:09:57,901
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, where are we going with this?

131
00:09:58,281 --> 00:10:00,222
[SPEAKER_23]: If this is supposed to be working together,

132
00:10:00,962 --> 00:10:04,183
[SPEAKER_23]: This can't work like that if they're not going to come out at nighttime to meet with us.

133
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:06,544
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I can't speak on behalf of the MBTA.

134
00:10:06,664 --> 00:10:07,524
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you aware of that?

135
00:10:07,945 --> 00:10:10,746
[SPEAKER_08]: I do not know of any communications to that effect.

136
00:10:10,806 --> 00:10:11,086
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay.

137
00:10:11,206 --> 00:10:19,249
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, maybe in your bailiwick of inventory of folks, you can figure out how to get them here because the bus stop comes under the control of the council, as you know.

138
00:10:19,889 --> 00:10:20,369
[SPEAKER_08]: Understood.

139
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:30,273
[SPEAKER_08]: And I believe the way it is tabled now is that once we've decided upon an appropriate location, we simply request that location to them and they will

140
00:10:30,955 --> 00:10:32,015
[SPEAKER_08]: accommodate that request.

141
00:10:32,095 --> 00:10:48,378
[SPEAKER_23]: And one other thing, if you can do this, um, you indicate that there are certain folks that are going to be affected and they are, if you walk around those businesses in the square, nobody has contacted them telling them of other bridge that took place a few weeks ago when you started doing some work there, the change in the time, the work, the work schedule.

142
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:57,640
[SPEAKER_23]: There's gotta be more communication because you know, business the way it is, it's tough to begin with and trying to keep your doors open.

143
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,440
[SPEAKER_23]: You meet all your expenses, you know,

144
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,081
[SPEAKER_23]: This is a huge project.

145
00:11:01,121 --> 00:11:14,423
[SPEAKER_23]: We know that it's going to take place until 2017, but if there's no actual personal contact and conversation with the business owners, you're going to have a hard time, you know, selling the project because you're having a hard time selling it to me.

146
00:11:15,264 --> 00:11:20,124
[SPEAKER_23]: But now you're telling me, and I'm glad they appreciate that people in the city are, you know, we have not gotten that response.

147
00:11:20,344 --> 00:11:21,825
[SPEAKER_23]: We don't even know what this lady you're talking about.

148
00:11:22,365 --> 00:11:24,885
[SPEAKER_23]: So Mr. Clerk, if we can ask, can you copy the letter?

149
00:11:25,865 --> 00:11:27,306
[SPEAKER_23]: We don't know about this letter about the bus stop.

150
00:11:27,906 --> 00:11:29,126
[SPEAKER_23]: Just hearing about it for the first time.

151
00:11:31,588 --> 00:11:32,908
[SPEAKER_23]: Do you have a copy that you could give us?

152
00:11:33,489 --> 00:11:33,629
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

153
00:11:34,329 --> 00:11:35,249
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a copy right here.

154
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,210
[SPEAKER_23]: You sent it November 18th.

155
00:11:41,891 --> 00:11:44,732
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, and who'd you address, Mr. Daly?

156
00:11:44,752 --> 00:11:45,672
[SPEAKER_23]: Who'd you address that to?

157
00:11:48,153 --> 00:11:50,033
[SPEAKER_23]: Could you make a copy of the letter?

158
00:11:51,593 --> 00:11:52,354
[SPEAKER_23]: That's not the letter.

159
00:11:52,414 --> 00:11:52,974
[SPEAKER_23]: That's the letter?

160
00:11:53,454 --> 00:11:54,314
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not the letter.

161
00:11:54,374 --> 00:11:55,715
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are the proposed locations.

162
00:11:55,735 --> 00:11:58,655
[SPEAKER_23]: Do you have a copy of the letter, Mr. Daly?

163
00:12:02,591 --> 00:12:04,452
[SPEAKER_23]: Please, for all the councillors.

164
00:12:07,653 --> 00:12:09,294
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a couple people in queue.

165
00:12:09,914 --> 00:12:11,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Point of information, Councillor Kerrio.

166
00:12:12,115 --> 00:12:18,297
[SPEAKER_02]: If the gentleman could just give us the three locations while we await the letter, I think it would be helpful.

167
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:25,000
[SPEAKER_15]: And if I'm correct, these are three temporary locations for the purpose of construction mitigation.

168
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,881
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, yeah, I think in lieu of the letter.

169
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:34,052
[SPEAKER_13]: chair recognizes Council Penter.

170
00:12:34,072 --> 00:12:34,712
[SPEAKER_23]: Are you all through?

171
00:12:35,493 --> 00:12:40,096
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm just concerned over the fact that is there a time requirement to this letter?

172
00:12:40,116 --> 00:12:45,019
[SPEAKER_08]: You were looking for an answer by, we need to give, it's our understanding.

173
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:51,483
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to give the MBTA two weeks notice for that relocation to take effect.

174
00:12:52,003 --> 00:12:52,744
[SPEAKER_08]: We're looking to

175
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:55,672
[SPEAKER_08]: get this in place in just over two weeks.

176
00:12:55,712 --> 00:12:56,933
[SPEAKER_08]: So time is running short.

177
00:12:57,013 --> 00:12:58,594
[SPEAKER_08]: So to not delay the project.

178
00:12:58,674 --> 00:13:03,898
[SPEAKER_23]: So this is their request that went out per letter, November 14th, they're looking for two week headstart.

179
00:13:04,278 --> 00:13:10,383
[SPEAKER_23]: We're hearing about this for the very first time and where the decision makers of where that bus stop goes.

180
00:13:12,444 --> 00:13:14,166
[SPEAKER_23]: I think you can understand where I'm coming from.

181
00:13:14,186 --> 00:13:21,251
[SPEAKER_23]: It's kind of like obvious that, you know, there's been no communication, you know, and they may just have to wait.

182
00:13:23,642 --> 00:13:25,684
[SPEAKER_15]: Chair recognizes Vice President Longo Kern.

183
00:13:25,844 --> 00:13:27,566
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, President De La Russo.

184
00:13:28,226 --> 00:13:45,182
[SPEAKER_17]: With regards to the moving of the MBTA bus stop, just so, through the council, we've met on this before, and the Commission for Persons with Disabilities is adamantly against the moving of that bus stop, so has anybody reached out to DiamaCloud or that?

185
00:13:46,642 --> 00:13:55,025
[SPEAKER_10]: department head, because... On November 18th, Scott forwarded me the three alternatives that's before you.

186
00:13:56,186 --> 00:14:07,751
[SPEAKER_10]: I sent it to Mr. DiLorenzo, forwarded that to the chief of police, Cassandra, Mr. Rumley, and the mayor's office.

187
00:14:07,811 --> 00:14:09,271
[SPEAKER_10]: And we have not gotten a response.

188
00:14:10,212 --> 00:14:10,412
[SPEAKER_10]: So...

189
00:14:12,147 --> 00:14:24,518
[SPEAKER_10]: If you could forward that letter to the commission for persons with disabilities correspond with the, um, right before Thanksgiving say she hasn't heard back and so on and so forth.

190
00:14:24,538 --> 00:14:29,782
[SPEAKER_10]: So up until this morning we were trying to, and I, that's why we laid this to the council president on the phone this morning.

191
00:14:29,842 --> 00:14:36,028
[SPEAKER_10]: I said, I'm going to forward you what I have and we have not heard back from the city departments that we thought would weigh in.

192
00:14:36,228 --> 00:14:36,328
[SPEAKER_10]: So

193
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:49,055
[SPEAKER_17]: Just because they're adamantly against it, I've received documentation within the last few weeks because we did have a meeting with the MBTA last week on something else, and she thought it was on this moving and this bus stop, and you know, we've gotten...

194
00:14:52,967 --> 00:14:58,650
[SPEAKER_10]: And she explained to me that that young lady did weigh in in the opposition, but we had not heard.

195
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:03,612
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I mean, obviously, we'd weigh in whatever comment she had.

196
00:15:03,632 --> 00:15:06,074
[SPEAKER_10]: The way they deserve us, we wouldn't do anything else.

197
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:08,675
[SPEAKER_10]: So we haven't heard anything back as of today, absent that.

198
00:15:08,695 --> 00:15:09,776
[SPEAKER_17]: So... Thank you.

199
00:15:09,796 --> 00:15:11,536
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, if we could get those documents, that would be good.

200
00:15:11,576 --> 00:15:18,540
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, the second issue, Councillor Penta touched on it with regards to the project being another three years in total.

201
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:22,222
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there a way that we can get updates to the business owners

202
00:15:22,701 --> 00:15:30,112
[SPEAKER_08]: even if a street's being shut down or certain sections being shut down for... Tell us how you'd like that and we'll be happy to get you whatever information you like.

203
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:31,814
[SPEAKER_15]: Can I make a suggestion?

204
00:15:31,854 --> 00:15:32,074
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

205
00:15:32,695 --> 00:15:38,724
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been active with the Green Line Extension Progress project that's gone on now for 12, 13 years we've been working on it.

206
00:15:39,913 --> 00:15:47,877
[SPEAKER_15]: Every week I get, there's a Greenline website, you get on their mailing list and they send you an email every week, update on construction.

207
00:15:48,357 --> 00:16:07,907
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe that's a simple way of creating emailing lists with this project that all stakeholders can get in on the list and get regular updates on the progress of the construction and whatever traffic alerts need to be made

208
00:16:08,254 --> 00:16:21,642
[SPEAKER_15]: through that, and that's what's done with the T. So whenever Harvard Street is going to be shut down or up on School Street, Somerville, whatever they've done in this whole extension project with the bridges, everybody's gotten an update.

209
00:16:22,182 --> 00:16:24,523
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think that's a good recommendation.

210
00:16:24,663 --> 00:16:32,788
[SPEAKER_17]: Some way that business owners who want to opt in to get an email once a week or even biweekly so they know what's coming in the next two weeks.

211
00:16:33,268 --> 00:16:36,870
[SPEAKER_17]: I've gotten complaints with regards to restaurants in the area.

212
00:16:38,568 --> 00:16:49,211
[SPEAKER_17]: two other businesses where the street was shut down for whatever it may have been, six, seven hours, and they were unaware it was gonna happen, you know, they lost, definitely lost business, lost customers.

213
00:16:49,712 --> 00:16:56,234
[SPEAKER_17]: So we need to be able to, whether it's through the website or through emails to businesses that wanna opt into that service.

214
00:16:56,654 --> 00:16:59,995
[SPEAKER_17]: And I, as one councilor, would like to get the updates, because we do get the complaints.

215
00:17:00,815 --> 00:17:02,236
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that's extremely important.

216
00:17:02,296 --> 00:17:06,237
[SPEAKER_17]: So if we could make that part of the recommendation to the contractor.

217
00:17:07,203 --> 00:17:07,964
[SPEAKER_17]: That will be helpful.

218
00:17:09,745 --> 00:17:10,966
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

219
00:17:11,146 --> 00:17:15,750
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have been sending out this briefing like this.

220
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:20,363
[SPEAKER_08]: bi-weekly, just give us the additional emails, and we'll add those on the list.

221
00:17:21,444 --> 00:17:23,005
[SPEAKER_08]: Just send us the email addresses.

222
00:17:23,025 --> 00:17:25,367
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been sending it to everybody that we've had.

223
00:17:25,907 --> 00:17:27,909
[SPEAKER_23]: One more group you might want to inform.

224
00:17:27,949 --> 00:17:28,990
[SPEAKER_23]: Point of information, Council Member.

225
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:30,851
[SPEAKER_23]: One more group might be the Memphis Chamber of Commerce.

226
00:17:31,672 --> 00:17:32,753
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

227
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:33,693
[SPEAKER_10]: Point of contact.

228
00:17:34,474 --> 00:17:37,196
[SPEAKER_17]: The Chamber of Commerce, Executive Director.

229
00:17:37,236 --> 00:17:38,057
[SPEAKER_17]: She was here today.

230
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:39,738
[SPEAKER_17]: She was here.

231
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:42,961
[SPEAKER_15]: Janet Donnelly is the Executive Director of the Chamber of Commerce.

232
00:17:45,102 --> 00:17:45,603
[SPEAKER_15]: Not a problem.

233
00:17:47,048 --> 00:17:47,969
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll be in touch on that.

234
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:51,832
[SPEAKER_15]: Chair recognizes Councillor Camuso.

235
00:17:52,132 --> 00:17:52,512
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

236
00:17:52,673 --> 00:17:57,836
[SPEAKER_07]: And thank you guys for coming down this evening, Mr. Daley, with your whole entourage.

237
00:17:58,617 --> 00:18:01,199
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a quick couple of questions on the bus stop relocation.

238
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:05,002
[SPEAKER_07]: It appears that the bus stop, the three options are going across the street.

239
00:18:05,442 --> 00:18:06,002
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that correct?

240
00:18:06,863 --> 00:18:12,067
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to cross the ramp onto Route 16 westbound.

241
00:18:12,683 --> 00:18:12,863
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

242
00:18:13,103 --> 00:18:13,303
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

243
00:18:13,463 --> 00:18:13,804
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

244
00:18:13,844 --> 00:18:14,124
[SPEAKER_08]: You do.

245
00:18:14,304 --> 00:18:14,464
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

246
00:18:14,564 --> 00:18:15,644
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to cross both sides.

247
00:18:15,664 --> 00:18:16,065
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to go.

248
00:18:16,145 --> 00:18:30,612
[SPEAKER_08]: So if someone's waiting for a bus, the bus will stop and then they have to cross the street to get on the bus between the location that we have now, it's going to be a giant work zone and we have to get them to the other side.

249
00:18:30,632 --> 00:18:31,492
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my next question.

250
00:18:31,512 --> 00:18:32,793
[SPEAKER_08]: But let's stop with the bus stops.

251
00:18:32,933 --> 00:18:34,834
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't traverse that area.

252
00:18:34,854 --> 00:18:35,814
[SPEAKER_08]: There's not going to be a bridge.

253
00:18:35,854 --> 00:18:39,596
[SPEAKER_08]: So you have to go across the street down and then back over.

254
00:18:40,436 --> 00:18:41,577
[SPEAKER_07]: But the bus stop itself,

255
00:18:42,103 --> 00:18:45,545
[SPEAKER_07]: Those red dots that you have are actually across the street.

256
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:48,547
[SPEAKER_08]: No, they're going to be on the same side as the restaurant.

257
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:50,708
[SPEAKER_08]: The restaurant's over here.

258
00:18:52,269 --> 00:18:55,070
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to go across the street, down, and then back.

259
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:56,651
[SPEAKER_08]: Back this way.

260
00:18:57,912 --> 00:19:00,573
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's going to be on the same side of the street.

261
00:19:00,593 --> 00:19:06,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you explain to people like myself that can't read construction maps, because it's very technical,

262
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:11,442
[SPEAKER_07]: Whereabouts are the three options so the viewing public will know?

263
00:19:11,462 --> 00:19:12,622
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, in layman's terms.

264
00:19:12,642 --> 00:19:18,447
[SPEAKER_08]: You have the Route 16 overpass, one's right in the middle.

265
00:19:18,947 --> 00:19:20,128
[SPEAKER_07]: In the middle of the overpass?

266
00:19:20,588 --> 00:19:21,749
[SPEAKER_07]: Underneath.

267
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:25,352
[SPEAKER_07]: Lighting will be approved and everything else if that happens?

268
00:19:25,772 --> 00:19:27,813
[SPEAKER_07]: I have not looked into that.

269
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:28,514
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it dark there?

270
00:19:28,893 --> 00:19:31,094
[SPEAKER_07]: It's docked there until you guys started.

271
00:19:31,715 --> 00:19:33,476
[SPEAKER_07]: Now you have trucks under there with the lights at night.

272
00:19:33,496 --> 00:19:38,679
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's, yeah, that's a, but you can't count that as a construction is not on for a day then.

273
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:39,560
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

274
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:40,640
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's the first location.

275
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:41,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Next.

276
00:19:41,161 --> 00:19:52,087
[SPEAKER_08]: They're along that same stretch and one is a closer to the westbound ramp and the other one's closer to the, the westbound ramp from like that little spout.

277
00:19:52,247 --> 00:19:58,271
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you come from the restaurant and take a right, I'm assuming it's either on the left side of the street or on the right.

278
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,841
[SPEAKER_07]: All three proposed stops are on the same side of the street.

279
00:20:01,921 --> 00:20:02,541
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand that.

280
00:20:02,621 --> 00:20:06,682
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're in front of the restaurant, you come up to the westbound on-ramp to Route 16.

281
00:20:06,722 --> 00:20:07,102
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.

282
00:20:07,342 --> 00:20:07,963
[SPEAKER_07]: You take a right.

283
00:20:08,863 --> 00:20:11,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Now you're facing West Medford, down Route 16.

284
00:20:11,964 --> 00:20:14,924
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it on your left or on your right compared to the restaurant?

285
00:20:14,944 --> 00:20:19,026
[SPEAKER_07]: If you were standing at the very beginning of the ramp, it would be immediately to your left.

286
00:20:19,246 --> 00:20:19,826
[SPEAKER_07]: To your left.

287
00:20:19,846 --> 00:20:27,448
[SPEAKER_07]: So you'll actually have to cross the on-ramp to Route 16 eastbound to get to the bus stop from the existing location.

288
00:20:28,078 --> 00:20:30,401
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's the closest one, it assumes, right?

289
00:20:30,482 --> 00:20:35,910
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, but that's where you will be crossing back across to that side of the ramp.

290
00:20:36,551 --> 00:20:42,059
[SPEAKER_08]: On the right side, if you're facing up that westbound ramp, the right side is gonna be a work zone.

291
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,082
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're not gonna be able to stand there.

292
00:20:44,757 --> 00:20:48,559
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're gonna have to walk by the work zone to get to the bus stops underneath the ramp.

293
00:20:48,699 --> 00:20:50,560
[SPEAKER_07]: If you go there, you're just very confused.

294
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,580
[SPEAKER_07]: Forget about the construction maps.

295
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,481
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm having a hard time.

296
00:20:55,402 --> 00:20:58,743
[SPEAKER_08]: If I could show you the picture, it might be easier to describe it.

297
00:20:59,323 --> 00:21:02,485
[SPEAKER_08]: But essentially, you're gonna be coming across.

298
00:21:02,745 --> 00:21:03,665
[SPEAKER_07]: So where's the restaurant?

299
00:21:05,426 --> 00:21:06,526
[SPEAKER_07]: The restaurant's not in the picture.

300
00:21:06,546 --> 00:21:07,387
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll get both points out.

301
00:21:07,407 --> 00:21:10,448
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I think we're all a little puzzled by looking at that map.

302
00:21:10,528 --> 00:21:10,888
[SPEAKER_08]: I got it.

303
00:21:11,088 --> 00:21:12,209
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me get another picture out here.

304
00:21:13,259 --> 00:21:16,140
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, here's the, it's two pictures.

305
00:21:23,902 --> 00:21:25,643
[SPEAKER_08]: Present location, restaurant.

306
00:21:26,643 --> 00:21:29,024
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, you're gonna have to get across.

307
00:21:31,865 --> 00:21:37,626
[SPEAKER_08]: You're gonna go across the bridge, get across again, you've got three locations.

308
00:21:38,427 --> 00:21:40,987
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, the closest one being though, right at the on-ramp.

309
00:21:41,007 --> 00:21:43,008
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the westbound on-ramp,

310
00:21:43,898 --> 00:21:46,961
[SPEAKER_07]: So you'd cross the street and the crosswalk, and it would be right there.

311
00:21:47,241 --> 00:21:47,561
[SPEAKER_08]: Correct.

312
00:21:47,621 --> 00:21:48,682
[SPEAKER_07]: You walk a little bit further on it.

313
00:21:48,722 --> 00:21:53,867
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to get onto this protected portion here on the sidewalk.

314
00:21:54,347 --> 00:21:55,588
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is handicap accessible?

315
00:21:55,848 --> 00:21:57,129
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to say it's, yes.

316
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:59,632
[SPEAKER_08]: It will all be ADA accessible.

317
00:22:00,432 --> 00:22:04,936
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to say that's 20 feet from the corner, ballpark.

318
00:22:06,017 --> 00:22:09,460
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's probably 50 feet from the existing bus stop, maybe a little more, 75?

319
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,821
[SPEAKER_07]: A little more than that.

320
00:22:12,045 --> 00:22:12,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Could you walk over the bridge?

321
00:22:13,606 --> 00:22:20,530
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's uh... I can't read the stations guys, what is it?

322
00:22:21,711 --> 00:22:22,611
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I thought, yeah.

323
00:22:22,711 --> 00:22:23,452
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about 500 feet.

324
00:22:23,672 --> 00:22:25,453
[SPEAKER_07]: 500 feet, that's a lot for a senior citizen.

325
00:22:27,734 --> 00:22:30,275
[SPEAKER_07]: We're open to any suggestions, we'll put it wherever you want it.

326
00:22:30,476 --> 00:22:36,159
[SPEAKER_07]: Well the problem is, we didn't even know it was an option at this point because the communication inside of this building

327
00:22:37,228 --> 00:22:39,670
[SPEAKER_07]: is certainly, there's a problem.

328
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:44,174
[SPEAKER_07]: November 18th, and trust me, I know how the MBTA and DOT work.

329
00:22:44,534 --> 00:22:47,617
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys are very good at notifying the community on what's going on.

330
00:22:48,697 --> 00:22:56,164
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's something else going on once it hits the network within City Hall, shall we say, the internal memos within City Hall.

331
00:22:56,644 --> 00:22:59,626
[SPEAKER_07]: But this is the first we're hearing about the three.

332
00:22:59,967 --> 00:23:01,468
[SPEAKER_07]: So I can understand the process.

333
00:23:01,568 --> 00:23:06,432
[SPEAKER_07]: They're probably coming up with a game plan which is the best, according to the professionals, the chief of police,

334
00:23:06,915 --> 00:23:12,957
[SPEAKER_07]: OCD, DPW, and then bringing it to the council for final approval, where we're the approving authority.

335
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:17,278
[SPEAKER_07]: But like you said, we were under the impression the bus stop was going to stay.

336
00:23:17,898 --> 00:23:19,618
[SPEAKER_07]: But that leads to my second question.

337
00:23:20,718 --> 00:23:30,521
[SPEAKER_07]: A work zone right in front of the restaurant, that's a bigger concern as far as the restaurant, the insurance company, the real estate agent,

338
00:23:31,695 --> 00:23:32,655
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you, when you define original?

339
00:23:32,675 --> 00:23:36,636
[SPEAKER_08]: That is where the barrier is going to be out to establish the work zone.

340
00:23:36,816 --> 00:23:41,418
[SPEAKER_08]: There's not going to be work itself going, but you won't be able to get a bus in there.

341
00:23:41,438 --> 00:23:46,119
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where we have to divert traffic over to that Eastern side.

342
00:23:46,219 --> 00:23:50,960
[SPEAKER_07]: So if someone parks on, for lack of a better word, the old ring road or whatever, what do you call it now?

343
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,441
[SPEAKER_07]: Clipper, Clipper ship drive.

344
00:23:56,382 --> 00:23:58,042
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's what it's, is that right?

345
00:23:59,427 --> 00:24:05,068
[SPEAKER_07]: So for lack of a better word, if you park on Clipper ship drive, you're still going to get access to the restaurant, the insurance company.

346
00:24:05,528 --> 00:24:09,509
[SPEAKER_07]: You could still walk across the street and get on the sidewalk and then get in the restaurant, right?

347
00:24:09,549 --> 00:24:10,049
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not going to.

348
00:24:10,349 --> 00:24:10,629
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

349
00:24:10,709 --> 00:24:10,910
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

350
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:11,450
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

351
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:26,733
[SPEAKER_07]: When you said work zone, I was just a little, uh, well, yeah, we, we can't have vehicles there though because so basically the barriers are just going to basically divert the road out towards because all the traffic coming towards Medford square from South Medford now is going to go over the new bridge.

352
00:24:27,472 --> 00:24:36,158
[SPEAKER_07]: And the traffic coming from Salem Street is now going to be diverted out, away from the restaurant, down to South Medford.

353
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:37,079
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.

354
00:24:37,639 --> 00:24:43,644
[SPEAKER_07]: And when you say work zone, it's nothing more than a diversion of 20 feet out, 30 feet out, 40 feet out.

355
00:24:43,764 --> 00:24:46,686
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, I feel a lot comfortable now.

356
00:24:47,386 --> 00:24:51,369
[SPEAKER_07]: When you said a work zone, I was figuring fences up, and those guys couldn't get to work.

357
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:55,392
[SPEAKER_07]: I know Mr. Veneziano wouldn't be happy about that particular.

358
00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:04,438
[SPEAKER_07]: With that being said, I just, I want to thank Mr. Daly and his staff too, because, uh, they, they, they obviously have been doing this communications.

359
00:25:04,938 --> 00:25:10,063
[SPEAKER_07]: The breakdown has been from within the walls of this very building that we sit in this evening.

360
00:25:10,724 --> 00:25:19,133
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um, so if you could just keep notifying and, and, um, and I like councilor Dela Russo's idea, the green line,

361
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:25,135
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, they've been keeping us abreast of the progress of that, probably weekly.

362
00:25:25,655 --> 00:25:34,581
[SPEAKER_07]: Between the DOT and the Mass Gaming Commission, I've never met two agencies that notify more on a consistent basis.

363
00:25:34,922 --> 00:25:39,625
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's something, as far as transparency, I'm very happy about.

364
00:25:39,805 --> 00:25:42,747
[SPEAKER_07]: The only thing the Green Line hasn't shared with us is their finances.

365
00:25:43,527 --> 00:25:43,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.

366
00:25:45,369 --> 00:25:47,330
[SPEAKER_07]: And hopefully, on a lighter note,

367
00:25:47,829 --> 00:25:49,811
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe that's going to be in about a month or so.

368
00:25:49,831 --> 00:25:52,153
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to come out with the actual report.

369
00:25:52,253 --> 00:25:54,314
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that fairly correct on that?

370
00:25:54,534 --> 00:25:59,218
[SPEAKER_07]: So I read that in today's Globe, but you can't take the Globe and everything else for 100%.

371
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,362
[SPEAKER_07]: But with that being said, if you could just please keep the notifications coming.

372
00:26:04,723 --> 00:26:11,188
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to reach out to Mr. Daley tomorrow, give you some additional email addresses to get on the external communique.

373
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:13,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Excellent.

374
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:16,312
[SPEAKER_07]: And one other person that has been

375
00:26:16,857 --> 00:26:24,198
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, pretty good with this and put me in touch with different, um, agencies regarding the DCR and some of the other stuff going on there has been representative Donato.

376
00:26:24,898 --> 00:26:32,800
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um, I know early on in this project back in June and July, there was a concern about the, um, environmental and the river and things like that.

377
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:38,541
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, rep Donato, uh, put, uh, put the constituents from South street in the right direction.

378
00:26:39,001 --> 00:26:43,902
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um, that, uh, that's always a good avenue of communications on, um,

379
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:46,637
[SPEAKER_07]: for those people, too.

380
00:26:46,697 --> 00:26:48,137
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's about it.

381
00:26:48,858 --> 00:26:49,578
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Counselor.

382
00:26:49,918 --> 00:26:51,779
[SPEAKER_15]: I know there's a citizen who would like to address us.

383
00:26:51,859 --> 00:26:57,262
[SPEAKER_15]: If you would, please present yourself to the podium and state your name and address for the record.

384
00:27:00,803 --> 00:27:01,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

385
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:04,173
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Rachel Tannenhaus.

386
00:27:04,233 --> 00:27:09,335
[SPEAKER_03]: My address is 26 Pearl Street and I am the chair of the Medford Disability Commission.

387
00:27:09,876 --> 00:27:12,017
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, welcome madam chairman.

388
00:27:12,337 --> 00:27:12,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

389
00:27:14,198 --> 00:27:20,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and, uh, so thank you very much for bringing up the, uh, concern, uh, Diane McLeod's concerns.

390
00:27:21,001 --> 00:27:26,024
[SPEAKER_04]: And she actually sent me an email before, uh, the, the meeting last week.

391
00:27:26,344 --> 00:27:27,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and I wasn't able to,

392
00:27:28,363 --> 00:27:37,370
[SPEAKER_04]: make that particular meeting where she thought it was being discussed, but she had to go home sick that day, so that's why she couldn't make it.

393
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:46,436
[SPEAKER_04]: So am I to understand that they're looking at moving the bus stop that's in front of Carol's?

394
00:27:47,317 --> 00:27:51,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that the restaurant we're talking about, the bus stop that they're looking at moving?

395
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:53,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct, okay.

396
00:27:54,091 --> 00:27:59,333
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's, as you said, that's a huge issue for senior citizens.

397
00:27:59,413 --> 00:28:01,534
[SPEAKER_04]: It's certainly a huge issue for folks with disabilities.

398
00:28:02,454 --> 00:28:04,835
[SPEAKER_04]: I will never find that bus stop again if they move it.

399
00:28:04,855 --> 00:28:07,456
[SPEAKER_04]: I gotta tell you, I'm gonna be wandering around everywhere forever.

400
00:28:07,576 --> 00:28:15,780
[SPEAKER_04]: So there needs to be some definite, like, if you did move it, there would have to be some really big indicators as to where it went.

401
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:18,601
[SPEAKER_04]: But I have to tell you, I live walking distance from,

402
00:28:19,808 --> 00:28:27,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Medford Square, and I take the bus because of those intersections that are there, the ones where the on-ramps are.

403
00:28:27,517 --> 00:28:31,962
[SPEAKER_04]: I could walk and get the exercise, and I could probably use it, but I don't really want to get flattened, so I don't.

404
00:28:35,425 --> 00:28:44,867
[SPEAKER_04]: having to cross those to get to the bus stop, also the safety issue, as you said, of putting the bus stop underneath the overpass.

405
00:28:45,427 --> 00:28:48,267
[SPEAKER_04]: I sometimes come back at night.

406
00:28:48,347 --> 00:28:49,467
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm traveling by myself.

407
00:28:49,807 --> 00:28:52,108
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to wait under that overpass.

408
00:28:52,128 --> 00:28:53,548
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, no offense, it's kind of hinky.

409
00:28:54,828 --> 00:28:57,249
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it is a safety issue.

410
00:28:57,269 --> 00:28:59,949
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have difficulty navigating there, even with the dog.

411
00:29:00,949 --> 00:29:03,830
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't even know what somebody using a wheelchair or with

412
00:29:05,793 --> 00:29:11,398
[SPEAKER_04]: or with stamina problems, some sort of condition that would have issues with stamina, I have no idea what they would do in that situation.

413
00:29:11,438 --> 00:29:21,528
[SPEAKER_04]: But I can tell you that in my situation, right now I come to Medford Square because I can take the bus and because there are good bus stops to get me back, I would just stop coming to Medford Square.

414
00:29:21,628 --> 00:29:26,993
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know that we're doing these things to, and it's not that I don't like Medford Square, I like it a lot and I encourage people to come here.

415
00:29:27,812 --> 00:29:37,655
[SPEAKER_04]: but in terms of going to restaurants around that area, it would be really, I mean, you're basically, I understand wanting to revitalize the square.

416
00:29:37,695 --> 00:29:42,016
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm in favor of doing that too, but you don't want to keep populations out in the name of revitalizing the square.

417
00:29:43,517 --> 00:29:46,758
[SPEAKER_04]: So I actually would like to, and are,

418
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:51,541
[SPEAKER_04]: So the blurry guys in the front, are you the ones who gave the presentation?

419
00:29:51,561 --> 00:29:52,101
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

420
00:29:52,321 --> 00:29:52,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

421
00:29:53,142 --> 00:29:55,063
[SPEAKER_04]: So hi, like I said, my name is Rachel.

422
00:29:55,383 --> 00:30:04,489
[SPEAKER_04]: I am one of the citizens that would be impacted by moving the bus stop, but also, like I said, I am the chair of the Medford Disability Commission.

423
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:07,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Our next meeting is December the 16th at 5.30 in the evening.

424
00:30:11,294 --> 00:30:14,516
[SPEAKER_04]: around the corner here in room 201.

425
00:30:15,096 --> 00:30:30,164
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll have to check with Diane McLeod, but I think I can extend to you an invitation to come if you'd like to talk to us about access around the site and also about moving the bus stop and get actual input from the disability community.

426
00:30:30,304 --> 00:30:34,246
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're having difficulty hearing back from Ms.

427
00:30:34,286 --> 00:30:36,787
[SPEAKER_04]: McLeod, and I know she was out sick a little bit before the holiday,

428
00:30:38,087 --> 00:30:42,828
[SPEAKER_04]: then we can totally hook you up and you can get all the input you want, probably some of you didn't.

429
00:30:44,208 --> 00:30:44,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

430
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:45,869
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Rachel.

431
00:30:46,209 --> 00:30:46,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

432
00:30:47,469 --> 00:30:50,169
[SPEAKER_15]: Chair recognizes Councilor Penta.

433
00:30:50,189 --> 00:30:53,170
[SPEAKER_23]: Mr. President, I think Mr... Who's the gentleman from the state?

434
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:53,750
[SPEAKER_23]: Who's that fellow?

435
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:55,450
[SPEAKER_23]: Scott.

436
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:55,730
[SPEAKER_23]: Scott, please.

437
00:30:59,051 --> 00:31:05,712
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, just so you know, we just were tossing around some ideas and before we

438
00:31:06,797 --> 00:31:10,878
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to get some lines on paper and make sure it's absolutely doable.

439
00:31:11,438 --> 00:31:22,542
[SPEAKER_08]: But right now we've, we think we may have a, uh, a way of making a dedicated lane for bus stop only and leave it in its present location.

440
00:31:22,622 --> 00:31:24,523
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to develop that tomorrow.

441
00:31:25,003 --> 00:31:26,303
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be in touch very shortly.

442
00:31:26,443 --> 00:31:28,964
[SPEAKER_08]: Very good.

443
00:31:30,044 --> 00:31:31,605
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to, we're gonna, we're gonna,

444
00:31:32,369 --> 00:31:33,270
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it can be done.

445
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:34,651
[SPEAKER_08]: We just want to make sure it can be.

446
00:31:34,771 --> 00:31:37,854
[SPEAKER_23]: But taking that into consideration, you said you listen to any and all ideas.

447
00:31:37,894 --> 00:31:49,925
[SPEAKER_23]: If in fact that doesn't work, you could still have those buses go right into Memphis square cause we had discussed as a spot of the issue and with the square is, and they could just traverse themselves around river street and come back, which is a one way.

448
00:31:49,985 --> 00:31:52,167
[SPEAKER_23]: And you could just reverse the one way, go on the opposite way.

449
00:31:52,687 --> 00:31:53,488
[SPEAKER_23]: And that would make it easier.

450
00:31:53,528 --> 00:31:57,171
[SPEAKER_23]: Cause don't forget you have two senior citizen buildings over there in excess of 500 people.

451
00:31:57,592 --> 00:31:58,993
[SPEAKER_23]: And for them to walk any further,

452
00:31:59,521 --> 00:32:04,964
[SPEAKER_23]: in the end of that ring road, then to cross over and go underneath the bridge, where it'd be a lot easier just to go to Mitford Square.

453
00:32:05,524 --> 00:32:13,268
[SPEAKER_23]: So, and again, folks that might have a handicap or a disability coming from Salem Street, Forest Street, or High Street would still be taking the same amount.

454
00:32:13,308 --> 00:32:22,172
[SPEAKER_23]: If not, it would be shorter for them just to walk across the square through the crosswalks, because you said you'd be making them properly and slated to be traversed.

455
00:32:22,192 --> 00:32:26,054
[SPEAKER_23]: So you have options that are there, and that's all that the council wanted to discuss.

456
00:32:26,552 --> 00:32:31,254
[SPEAKER_23]: is what the options are, what would work the best, and it becomes very hard when you have no communication.

457
00:32:31,294 --> 00:32:32,894
[SPEAKER_23]: So I'm just throwing that out there.

458
00:32:33,354 --> 00:32:33,775
[SPEAKER_23]: Understood.

459
00:32:34,355 --> 00:32:34,695
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

460
00:32:35,475 --> 00:32:37,376
[SPEAKER_23]: Chair recognizes Vice President Lugo-Kern.

461
00:32:37,516 --> 00:32:37,876
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

462
00:32:38,216 --> 00:32:41,657
[SPEAKER_17]: Just so we can be sure, if Mr. Daley could come up.

463
00:32:43,898 --> 00:32:52,221
[SPEAKER_17]: You had mentioned that we can, any business owner or city councilor or anybody in the public that wants to get updates on the Craddock Bridge can go on this list.

464
00:32:53,041 --> 00:32:54,762
[SPEAKER_17]: How do we get them on that list or how do we?

465
00:32:55,138 --> 00:32:56,839
[SPEAKER_17]: just send me the emails.

466
00:32:57,559 --> 00:32:58,719
[SPEAKER_10]: And how do we contact you?

467
00:32:58,759 --> 00:33:08,743
[SPEAKER_10]: We already have a database of about how many emails we have.

468
00:33:09,183 --> 00:33:10,843
[SPEAKER_23]: No, but what's the contact?

469
00:33:11,004 --> 00:33:14,705
[SPEAKER_17]: So you have about four or five emails that are getting... Yeah, we need whatever database you have.

470
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:22,442
[SPEAKER_10]: like the chamber groups and so on and so forth, and the civic groups and stuff like that.

471
00:33:22,923 --> 00:33:24,464
[SPEAKER_17]: And what's your email, if we could?

472
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:26,205
[SPEAKER_10]: I can give you my contact.

473
00:33:26,445 --> 00:33:26,545
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

474
00:33:26,565 --> 00:33:30,567
[SPEAKER_10]: Give us a messenger.

475
00:33:31,028 --> 00:33:33,729
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, make copies.

476
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:37,471
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'll get it up to our IT department.

477
00:33:38,652 --> 00:33:39,012
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

478
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:41,034
[SPEAKER_10]: But we do advisories weekly on a lot of projects.

479
00:33:41,054 --> 00:33:42,094
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if you folks are familiar.

480
00:33:42,114 --> 00:33:44,916
[SPEAKER_10]: Like the Arlington Mass Ave project, we just cut the ribbon on that.

481
00:33:44,936 --> 00:33:48,238
[SPEAKER_10]: We did weekly updates and stuff like that.

482
00:33:48,601 --> 00:33:54,323
[SPEAKER_17]: And that will tell you if any roads are shutting down or any major work, what's coming up for the next weeks.

483
00:33:54,523 --> 00:33:59,465
[SPEAKER_10]: We can do that on a weekly basis.

484
00:33:59,545 --> 00:34:01,366
[SPEAKER_10]: It's pretty common practice we have.

485
00:34:01,386 --> 00:34:02,366
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you.

486
00:34:02,646 --> 00:34:08,008
[SPEAKER_23]: And one of the other things to the chair, um, you said this was going to be a six day a week double shift project.

487
00:34:09,569 --> 00:34:11,289
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't speak to that also, but, um,

488
00:34:18,672 --> 00:34:21,955
[SPEAKER_10]: You want to speak to the schedule?

489
00:34:22,795 --> 00:34:23,536
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I wouldn't.

490
00:34:25,017 --> 00:34:29,620
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, just please state your name and address for the record.

491
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:32,442
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm the project manager.

492
00:34:33,083 --> 00:34:34,804
[SPEAKER_15]: Wonderful, thank you.

493
00:34:35,545 --> 00:34:47,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Shift-wise, we are on a dedicated five-day work week, eight hours a day during the day, except four times.

494
00:34:48,923 --> 00:34:58,887
[SPEAKER_05]: when we need to catch up or B need to do things that are less disruptive at night, like setting the bridge that we did several weeks ago.

495
00:34:58,987 --> 00:35:04,069
[SPEAKER_05]: But our schedule is daytime five days a week, eight hours a day.

496
00:35:04,949 --> 00:35:05,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

497
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:13,012
[SPEAKER_23]: That's your schedule now, but I believe when you folks were here, the presentation was made, it was going to be a double shift twice a week, six days a week.

498
00:35:14,793 --> 00:35:17,134
[SPEAKER_05]: That was never stated.

499
00:35:17,825 --> 00:35:21,206
[SPEAKER_05]: it is available to us.

500
00:35:21,306 --> 00:35:23,707
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the work shifts that are available to us.

501
00:35:25,087 --> 00:35:36,570
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we need those to make up schedule, we certainly will use them so that we can maintain our schedule and get our completion and be out of your hair as soon as we can.

502
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:40,431
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, wouldn't it make more sense if you did double shifts twice a day?

503
00:35:40,451 --> 00:35:41,571
[SPEAKER_23]: We wouldn't have to wait to 2017?

504
00:35:41,611 --> 00:35:41,991
[SPEAKER_23]: 18, excuse me.

505
00:35:46,335 --> 00:35:48,056
[SPEAKER_05]: That doesn't really solve the problems.

506
00:35:48,416 --> 00:35:59,180
[SPEAKER_05]: The schedule issues are wrapped around public utilities that have to make their own movements and our schedules for in-water work.

507
00:36:01,261 --> 00:36:04,202
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't work in the water four months a year.

508
00:36:05,843 --> 00:36:07,043
[SPEAKER_05]: It creates difficulties.

509
00:36:07,964 --> 00:36:13,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Within a schedule like this, if we miss two or three days and miss our water windows,

510
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:18,843
[SPEAKER_05]: we lose four or five months in the schedule.

511
00:36:20,064 --> 00:36:28,050
[SPEAKER_05]: But if we get caught up and I'm ahead of schedule, I may have to sit and wait four or five months to work.

512
00:36:28,771 --> 00:36:36,597
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have to plan our work so that we work continuously, meet our milestones, and get our work done on time.

513
00:36:37,537 --> 00:36:38,378
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very important.

514
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,520
[SPEAKER_05]: So working ahead.

515
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:53,042
[SPEAKER_05]: working really quickly to finish a certain amount of tasks and then having to go home for four months doesn't advance the cause at all.

516
00:36:55,782 --> 00:36:56,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

517
00:36:57,903 --> 00:37:02,083
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't think it advances the cause to wait to 2018 even for 121 feet.

518
00:37:04,824 --> 00:37:05,124
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

519
00:37:05,344 --> 00:37:05,644
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

520
00:37:05,684 --> 00:37:06,464
[SPEAKER_15]: Counselor Penta.

521
00:37:07,024 --> 00:37:07,604
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, sir.

522
00:37:08,705 --> 00:37:10,005
[SPEAKER_15]: Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

523
00:37:10,165 --> 00:37:11,185
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President,

524
00:37:11,816 --> 00:37:24,741
[SPEAKER_11]: If the project manager would just come back for a second, Scott, it's, it's my understanding that the gentleman just referred to water windows and water work windows, water work windows.

525
00:37:24,781 --> 00:37:34,965
[SPEAKER_11]: And based upon the presentation you guys gave last time, there are certain periods of time of the year precluded from being able to work at the site based on, is it federal standard or state standard?

526
00:37:35,345 --> 00:37:35,445
[SPEAKER_11]: It's,

527
00:37:35,995 --> 00:37:40,158
[SPEAKER_08]: It involves environmental permitting for the, there's an in water restriction.

528
00:37:40,618 --> 00:37:40,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

529
00:37:41,439 --> 00:37:45,241
[SPEAKER_08]: So in terms of, so, but the project can work.

530
00:37:45,581 --> 00:37:47,823
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just not, you can't be in the water.

531
00:37:47,843 --> 00:37:47,923
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

532
00:37:47,943 --> 00:37:50,204
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

533
00:37:50,905 --> 00:37:51,785
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

534
00:37:52,846 --> 00:38:01,111
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, on the motion, uh, sir, if you want to, uh, address the council, please state your name and address for the record.

535
00:38:01,591 --> 00:38:02,672
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. President.

536
00:38:02,792 --> 00:38:04,713
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm Bob Caputi, 71 Evans street.

537
00:38:07,171 --> 00:38:10,572
[SPEAKER_20]: My concern is this bus stop in the work area.

538
00:38:11,352 --> 00:38:15,613
[SPEAKER_20]: I would really like to know what's going to happen here.

539
00:38:16,033 --> 00:38:19,474
[SPEAKER_20]: Are they going to shut down that street?

540
00:38:19,774 --> 00:38:31,676
[SPEAKER_20]: And if so, it might help the local businesses there for whatever part of the street you're going to shut down if you allow, if it's possible, some parking there.

541
00:38:32,716 --> 00:38:36,037
[SPEAKER_20]: I know firsthand, I mean, we all know Carol's restaurant.

542
00:38:36,421 --> 00:38:39,302
[SPEAKER_20]: It's been a tradition in Medford for going on a century here.

543
00:38:39,702 --> 00:38:49,767
[SPEAKER_20]: He's been a friend to me, the family, a lot of you guys here, and I go there a lot, as most of you do, too, and he's losing a ton of business.

544
00:38:50,167 --> 00:39:03,173
[SPEAKER_20]: What I would like to also see is, you know, make sure that these construction crews that are coming in are maintaining that area in terms of eyesore and clutter and whatnot because, you know, along with

545
00:39:03,798 --> 00:39:06,438
[SPEAKER_20]: regular customers of the restaurant.

546
00:39:06,699 --> 00:39:10,359
[SPEAKER_20]: There's also functions and groups that come in there from out of town.

547
00:39:10,859 --> 00:39:24,522
[SPEAKER_20]: Maybe some kind of deal can be made with Republic for a wedding special going on there or a baby shower where carols might be able to print up some cards for these folks and get them in there.

548
00:39:25,042 --> 00:39:32,103
[SPEAKER_20]: And finally, one last thing on the bus stop and what the chairman of the disability community was saying.

549
00:39:33,015 --> 00:39:44,123
[SPEAKER_20]: Maybe somebody from this body can reach out to the MBTA somehow and use that van service that they have and maybe offer some of these folks a ride if they need it.

550
00:39:44,263 --> 00:39:58,873
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, I mean, this, I don't have to tell you folks, this is your job to make sure that the taxpayers, the businesses, and the citizens are well taken care of and that street and area is as safe and accessible as possible.

551
00:39:59,073 --> 00:39:59,653
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. President.

552
00:39:59,713 --> 00:39:59,893
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

553
00:39:59,933 --> 00:40:02,115
[SPEAKER_15]: So on the motion of approval by Councillor Penta,

554
00:40:03,046 --> 00:40:04,946
[SPEAKER_15]: As amended, seconded by Councilor Knight.

555
00:40:04,986 --> 00:40:05,727
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

556
00:40:06,247 --> 00:40:06,847
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

557
00:40:06,867 --> 00:40:07,687
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion carries.

558
00:40:08,127 --> 00:40:20,030
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much folks from the Department of Transportation for all your efforts and a special word of thanks to Representative Donato for his leadership in this matter.

559
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:21,150
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you all.

560
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,970
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion for suspension by Councilor Knight.

561
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:25,311
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

562
00:40:26,451 --> 00:40:27,191
[SPEAKER_15]: While we're under suspension.

563
00:40:27,231 --> 00:40:29,171
[SPEAKER_15]: While we're under suspension, yes.

564
00:40:29,431 --> 00:40:32,152
[SPEAKER_11]: Last week we put a resolution forward relative to the schedule

565
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:36,982
[SPEAKER_11]: changes that were potential at the West Medford commuter rail station.

566
00:40:37,102 --> 00:40:49,089
[SPEAKER_11]: And I believe that we got word back from our state delegation that those changes have been put on hold for the time being until an exhaustive public hearing process can be conducted, Mr. President.

567
00:40:49,129 --> 00:40:55,953
[SPEAKER_11]: So while Representative Donato was here, I thought we should thank him for his hard work and his efforts and give him an opportunity to maybe speak on the matter if he sees fit.

568
00:40:56,674 --> 00:40:57,434
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

569
00:41:00,648 --> 00:41:04,610
[SPEAKER_21]: Paul Donato, Representative of 35th Middle Sixth District.

570
00:41:05,951 --> 00:41:17,737
[SPEAKER_21]: The Medford delegation, along with Senator Lewis, who represents Winchester, had a meeting with the MBTA ten days ago.

571
00:41:18,497 --> 00:41:25,801
[SPEAKER_21]: We expressed our concern with regard to the commuter rail changes, and because of our meeting,

572
00:41:26,385 --> 00:41:30,707
[SPEAKER_21]: And our advocacy, I have to tell you that the delegation worked very diligently.

573
00:41:31,147 --> 00:41:34,468
[SPEAKER_21]: We're not very happy with the changes that were being proposed.

574
00:41:35,048 --> 00:41:47,892
[SPEAKER_21]: And the MBTA has relinquished their position relative to the December 15th for the changes and instead is working toward April.

575
00:41:48,513 --> 00:41:53,154
[SPEAKER_21]: The delegation is working once again with the MBTA.

576
00:41:53,194 --> 00:41:55,515
[SPEAKER_21]: We plan a meeting sometime in February to

577
00:41:56,113 --> 00:42:02,994
[SPEAKER_21]: continue the dialogue so that the impact of any of the changes that will be made on the commuter rail will be minimum.

578
00:42:03,795 --> 00:42:06,835
[SPEAKER_21]: Uh, and, and that's where we are at this particular time.

579
00:42:07,035 --> 00:42:07,635
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Representative.

580
00:42:08,176 --> 00:42:08,516
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

581
00:42:08,836 --> 00:42:09,136
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

582
00:42:09,476 --> 00:42:10,496
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Representative.

583
00:42:10,956 --> 00:42:16,557
[SPEAKER_15]: So the motion for approval, uh, all those in favor, all those motion carries.

[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Mr. Councilor.

586
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:25,973
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to take 15-432 off the table and receive it and place it on file.

587
00:42:26,333 --> 00:42:29,215
[SPEAKER_07]: The MassDOT was here this evening and that was for them to appear.

588
00:42:30,175 --> 00:42:33,396
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, that was the paper that we actually took and acted upon.

589
00:42:33,476 --> 00:42:34,116
[SPEAKER_15]: We took, okay.

590
00:42:34,277 --> 00:42:34,617
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

591
00:42:34,657 --> 00:42:35,237

00:42:41,179 --> 00:42:44,260

605
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:33,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:36,973
[SPEAKER_02]: And not in other cities, and you won't be picking Boston coming back there?

[SPEAKER_18]: No, I already have the Boston license.

00:43:43,157 --> 00:43:45,318
[SPEAKER_18]: I have a Boston license already.

00:44:08,824 --> 00:44:10,085
[SPEAKER_18]: Town, what, here?

615
00:44:10,505 --> 00:44:13,926
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I just taking it, Friday.

00:44:14,206 --> 00:44:16,107
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have a license to drive in Boston also?

00:44:16,627 --> 00:44:16,887

[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, on last Friday.

620
00:44:21,584 --> 00:44:27,305
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're going to need to change replication on question 15 to yes.

621
00:44:29,346 --> 00:44:30,866
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was before.

622
00:44:32,387 --> 00:44:43,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Clerk, is that- You don't have to use the license for Boston County anyway, so it doesn't- Well, Mr. President, his paperwork seems to be in order.

623
00:44:43,070 --> 00:44:43,870
[SPEAKER_02]: I recommend approval.

624
00:44:44,448 --> 00:44:49,211
[SPEAKER_15]: On the recommendation of approval and the motion of approval by Councilor Caravaglio, all those in favor?

625
00:44:50,411 --> 00:44:51,212
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

626
00:44:52,793 --> 00:44:56,575
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk, please mark Councilor Penta as opposed.

627
00:45:02,398 --> 00:45:12,044
[SPEAKER_15]: For the reasons of lack of resolution in the taxicab onus issue and likewise mark

628
00:45:12,715 --> 00:45:14,315
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Marks is in opposition.

629
00:45:14,755 --> 00:45:19,156
[SPEAKER_15]: The chair is confident that there's a prevailing authority for granting the approval.

630
00:45:19,676 --> 00:45:30,639
[SPEAKER_15]: So the motion is approved.

631
00:45:30,659 --> 00:45:38,520
[SPEAKER_15]: 15781 communications from the mayor to the honorable president and members of the Medford City Council, City Hall, Medford Mass, 02155, dear Mr. President and city councilors.

632
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:41,821
[SPEAKER_15]: I respectfully request and recommend that the sum of

633
00:45:44,986 --> 00:45:54,068
[SPEAKER_15]: $147,687 be transferred from sale of real estate to reduce the deficit of June 30th, 2015 in the accounts of snow and ice removal.

634
00:45:54,448 --> 00:46:08,411
[SPEAKER_15]: This transfer combined with the FEMA reimbursement and the amount raised on the fiscal year 2016 tax rate will eliminate the entire deficit, see attached, yours truly, very Michael J. McGlynn, Mayor.

635
00:46:09,531 --> 00:46:11,872
[SPEAKER_15]: With us this evening to make explanation for this

636
00:46:12,208 --> 00:46:16,189
[SPEAKER_15]: Transfer is Louise Miller, Director of Budget, Finance, and Personnel.

637
00:46:17,189 --> 00:46:17,889
[SPEAKER_15]: Madam Directors.

638
00:46:18,649 --> 00:46:19,109
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

639
00:46:22,230 --> 00:46:39,453
[SPEAKER_22]: You should have received an attachment from Anne Baker, Finance Director, to Mayor McGlynn that explained the snow and ice deficit and the various components needed so that the snow and ice deficit is reduced to zero in the year going forward.

640
00:46:43,070 --> 00:47:04,660
[SPEAKER_22]: Based upon our anticipated FEMA reimbursement, as well as the amount that will be raised this year, once the tax rate is set, we still need $147,687 to bridge the gap and zero out the deficit.

641
00:47:05,841 --> 00:47:10,263
[SPEAKER_22]: We have proposed, or the mayor has proposed, that this amount be transferred

642
00:47:11,010 --> 00:47:23,198
[SPEAKER_22]: from the sale of real estate account, which right now has $400,000 in it, and that we go forward without a snow and ice deficit this year in fiscal year 16.

643
00:47:23,338 --> 00:47:30,202
[SPEAKER_15]: Chair recognizes Madam Vice President Longo.

644
00:47:30,322 --> 00:47:31,783
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, President DelaRusso.

645
00:47:31,843 --> 00:47:32,864
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to thank Ms.

646
00:47:32,904 --> 00:47:39,088
[SPEAKER_17]: Miller for giving us the snow and ice amortization schedule, which was in our Friday packet.

647
00:47:39,557 --> 00:47:42,878
[SPEAKER_17]: and I'm very pleased that we'll be paying off the entire debt from last year.

648
00:47:42,898 --> 00:47:45,259
[SPEAKER_17]: It was a hefty one of 1.8 million.

649
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:53,843
[SPEAKER_17]: We're lucky to get 500,000 from FEMA, but I'm glad that the city, you know, we came up with the 1.3 million that we needed to.

650
00:47:54,263 --> 00:47:59,445
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I approve this transfer and I think it's a good way to do business.

651
00:47:59,725 --> 00:48:00,026
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

652
00:48:00,486 --> 00:48:04,347
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion approved by Vice President Longo-Curran, chair recognizes Councilor Penta.

653
00:48:04,508 --> 00:48:05,048
[SPEAKER_23]: Quick question.

654
00:48:06,068 --> 00:48:07,049
[SPEAKER_23]: You're saying that the 500,000 is an estimate,

655
00:48:08,848 --> 00:48:10,149
[SPEAKER_23]: Do we have a final number?

656
00:48:11,069 --> 00:48:12,970
[SPEAKER_22]: We do not have a final number from FEMA.

657
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:19,372
[SPEAKER_22]: We did submit all of our paperwork a couple of months ago, but we still have not heard back from them on what the final number will be.

658
00:48:19,432 --> 00:48:22,714
[SPEAKER_23]: So is it possible that they may not accept the $500,000?

659
00:48:23,754 --> 00:48:24,514
[SPEAKER_22]: No, actually.

660
00:48:24,794 --> 00:48:27,035
[SPEAKER_22]: If anything, we would receive a little bit more.

661
00:48:27,375 --> 00:48:36,359
[SPEAKER_22]: We estimated the $500,000 based upon 75% reimbursement of all the costs that they've told us we were going to receive.

662
00:48:36,833 --> 00:48:45,175
[SPEAKER_22]: In addition to that, we had asked for some costs for some repairs that we had to do to buildings and at the cemetery specifically.

663
00:48:45,595 --> 00:48:50,575
[SPEAKER_22]: So if anything, we would get a small amount more, maybe $25,000 to $35,000, more than that.

664
00:48:51,636 --> 00:48:52,836
[SPEAKER_23]: But why haven't we heard yet?

665
00:48:52,876 --> 00:48:53,796
[SPEAKER_23]: Why is it taking so long?

666
00:48:54,596 --> 00:48:55,656
[SPEAKER_22]: I can't answer that.

667
00:48:55,756 --> 00:49:00,257
[SPEAKER_22]: We have worked now with four different representatives of FEMA.

668
00:49:00,277 --> 00:49:01,797
[SPEAKER_22]: We're on our fourth representative.

669
00:49:02,958 --> 00:49:04,598
[SPEAKER_22]: It just takes time.

670
00:49:08,410 --> 00:49:08,690
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay.

671
00:49:14,595 --> 00:49:15,275
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, councillor.

672
00:49:17,517 --> 00:49:22,761
[SPEAKER_13]: A motion of approval by councillor Lange-Kern, seconded by councillor Knight.

673
00:49:23,602 --> 00:49:24,042
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a roll?

674
00:49:25,543 --> 00:49:26,124
[SPEAKER_13]: Roll call.

675
00:49:27,605 --> 00:49:28,465
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Camuso.

676
00:49:28,625 --> 00:49:28,906
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

677
00:49:29,426 --> 00:49:30,207
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Caviello.

678
00:49:30,287 --> 00:49:30,627
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

679
00:49:30,947 --> 00:49:31,448
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

680
00:49:31,568 --> 00:49:31,908
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

681
00:49:32,268 --> 00:49:33,229
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice-president Lange-Kern.

682
00:49:33,269 --> 00:49:33,609
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

683
00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:34,590
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Max.

684
00:49:35,211 --> 00:49:35,551
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

685
00:49:36,251 --> 00:49:36,852
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Penta.

686
00:49:36,912 --> 00:49:37,132
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

687
00:49:38,372 --> 00:49:41,434
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, with a vote of seven, the affirmative, none negative, the measure passes.

688
00:49:45,918 --> 00:49:53,264
[SPEAKER_15]: Next before us, 15782, to the Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council, Medford City Hall, Medford Mass, 02155.

689
00:49:54,044 --> 00:50:04,072
[SPEAKER_15]: Dear Mr. President and City Councilors, I respectfully request and recommend your approval of transfer to support the operations of the enterprise funds for fiscal year 16 as follows.

690
00:50:07,675 --> 00:50:13,260
[SPEAKER_15]: From water retained earnings, $212,080 to Water Enterprise, and from sewer retained earnings, $487,920 to Sewer Enterprise.

691
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,882
[SPEAKER_15]: After this transfer, the remaining balances will be as follows.

692
00:50:15,902 --> 00:50:16,402
[SPEAKER_15]: Water retained earnings, $3,150,930.

693
00:50:16,442 --> 00:50:18,023
[SPEAKER_15]: Sewer retained earnings, $3,885,627, very truly yours,

694
00:50:36,605 --> 00:50:46,150
[SPEAKER_15]: very Michael J. McGlynn mayor on the motion for approval by councilor Penta, uh, councilor Camuso, councilor Penta.

695
00:50:46,310 --> 00:50:49,072
[SPEAKER_23]: Could you explain what this money is for please?

696
00:50:49,552 --> 00:50:49,832
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

697
00:50:50,352 --> 00:50:54,354
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, last year the water and sewer rates were changed.

698
00:50:54,715 --> 00:51:00,838
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, they were tiered and the, they are not sufficient to meet the water and sewer

699
00:51:01,371 --> 00:51:05,633
[SPEAKER_22]: operating budgets, including the MWRA assessments.

700
00:51:06,193 --> 00:51:13,116
[SPEAKER_22]: So the $700,000 is half of the projected deficit for fiscal year 16.

701
00:51:13,596 --> 00:51:22,779
[SPEAKER_22]: The other half of the projected deficit is going to be raised through modification of the water rates.

702
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:29,182
[SPEAKER_22]: The Water and Sewer Commission voted new rates that will go into effect

703
00:51:29,987 --> 00:51:37,010
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, some portion of it may go into effect in December, but it will go into effect, um, completely in January.

704
00:51:39,591 --> 00:51:39,992
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay.

705
00:51:41,112 --> 00:51:53,718
[SPEAKER_23]: So this is kind of like interesting because a couple of years ago when they were discussing the budget, when the council had asked that the money be taken from the water and sewer account, um, the water and sewer commission indicated that that wasn't their purview.

706
00:51:53,738 --> 00:51:54,478
[SPEAKER_23]: It was up to the mayor.

707
00:51:55,639 --> 00:51:58,600
[SPEAKER_23]: Now you're saying tonight that they made a recommendation to take this money

708
00:51:59,428 --> 00:52:09,772
[SPEAKER_23]: of approximately $700,000 or above to go to offset the cost of our water and soil bills here in the city of Medford.

709
00:52:09,792 --> 00:52:19,036
[SPEAKER_23]: Don't forget, I believe we get a discount, strike that, we get a wholesale discount rate from the MWRA, and then the rest of the cost relates to the city of Medford's operation, water and soil department.

710
00:52:19,236 --> 00:52:19,376
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay.

711
00:52:19,396 --> 00:52:19,816
[SPEAKER_23]: That's correct.

712
00:52:20,497 --> 00:52:24,458
[SPEAKER_23]: So if we take this balance, if we transfer this money, we have a balance of $7,036,000.

713
00:52:24,738 --> 00:52:24,958
[SPEAKER_23]: $7 million.

714
00:52:30,401 --> 00:52:34,503
[SPEAKER_23]: I just don't understand why they just don't take the whole thing from the water and sewer account.

715
00:52:34,923 --> 00:52:36,103
[SPEAKER_23]: That's the taxpayer's money.

716
00:52:36,244 --> 00:52:39,645
[SPEAKER_23]: They'd be the overpaid or whatever the account might situation might be.

717
00:52:40,305 --> 00:52:42,666
[SPEAKER_23]: That would have made it a $7.7 million surplus.

718
00:52:43,206 --> 00:52:45,687
[SPEAKER_23]: So the amount that you're taking out right now leaves you with a balance of $7,036,000.

719
00:52:46,568 --> 00:52:49,809
[SPEAKER_23]: It's the taxpayer's money, the rate payers money.

720
00:52:50,449 --> 00:52:59,173
[SPEAKER_23]: They didn't cost, they didn't, it wasn't their charge to raise the rates, you know, and if they made a mistake somewhere along the line, as it relates to this rate structure,

721
00:52:59,618 --> 00:53:00,758
[SPEAKER_23]: then that needs to be figured out.

722
00:53:00,818 --> 00:53:07,759
[SPEAKER_23]: But the taxpayers should not have to pay for it, especially since this is their money that they've had there in surplus for all this amount of time.

723
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:10,120
[SPEAKER_23]: The law is very simple, as you know.

724
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:11,480
[SPEAKER_23]: It's either one or two things.

725
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:20,542
[SPEAKER_23]: The law says, unless you have something that's ready to go in a ready-made project within 90 days, or there's a surplus remaining that goes back to the rate payers.

726
00:53:20,582 --> 00:53:22,102
[SPEAKER_23]: Now, this has been going on for a few years.

727
00:53:22,122 --> 00:53:23,282
[SPEAKER_23]: $7 million and $36 million.

728
00:53:23,302 --> 00:53:25,142
[SPEAKER_23]: $7 million, $36,000, leaving you with a balance.

729
00:53:25,182 --> 00:53:25,722
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm going to vote.

730
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:36,152
[SPEAKER_23]: that this not go through, that this money come out of the Water and Soil Enterprise account, period.

731
00:53:36,712 --> 00:53:38,373
[SPEAKER_23]: The rate payers should not have to pay for this.

732
00:53:38,493 --> 00:53:41,473
[SPEAKER_23]: Let the city figure out where they went wrong and if they have to make an adjustment.

733
00:53:42,154 --> 00:53:57,338
[SPEAKER_23]: Because it's bad enough that they've been taxed for everything in this community from A to Z. And I just don't think it's fair, especially knowing that you have a remaining balance of $7 million and there is not one project sitting in front of us right now that has a demand of any kind of money.

734
00:53:58,208 --> 00:53:59,969
[SPEAKER_23]: that the water and sewer account has for a balance.

735
00:54:00,009 --> 00:54:00,589
[SPEAKER_23]: That's number one.

736
00:54:00,629 --> 00:54:05,211
[SPEAKER_23]: Number two, I can see leaving maybe two or $3 million in that account in case an emergency takes place.

737
00:54:05,891 --> 00:54:17,056
[SPEAKER_23]: We've had no discussion from the city engineer, the building department or the highway department, public works department regarding a project that the city needs to undertake right now or it's going to be undertaking.

738
00:54:18,316 --> 00:54:21,738
[SPEAKER_23]: All we know right now is that there is this kind of a surplus sitting there.

739
00:54:22,498 --> 00:54:23,198
[SPEAKER_23]: It's unfair.

740
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:27,340
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't think that the rate payers should have their money that they've paid for

741
00:54:28,335 --> 00:54:29,436
[SPEAKER_23]: now be charged again.

742
00:54:29,456 --> 00:54:39,984
[SPEAKER_23]: I think that money should stay in this account and the city and the city engineer and the new administration should figure out what all the INI and the water leaks and the things that need to be corrected here in this community.

743
00:54:40,264 --> 00:54:56,316
[SPEAKER_23]: They better get on their duff real quick because this is what the administration has been talking about, whether it was myself or the incoming person, you know, this city needs to have a lot of reconstruction in this community as it relates to their water and sewer, their INI and their street and their side construction projects.

744
00:54:57,157 --> 00:54:57,277
[SPEAKER_23]: So,

745
00:54:57,902 --> 00:55:03,624
[SPEAKER_23]: Take this out of this account and transfer it over to pay a debt that belongs with the city.

746
00:55:03,644 --> 00:55:07,105
[SPEAKER_23]: If they mismanaged and miscalculated, don't blame the taxpayer.

747
00:55:07,425 --> 00:55:09,806
[SPEAKER_23]: They've been blamed enough for what goes on in this community.

748
00:55:10,806 --> 00:55:18,708
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm going to move, Mr. President, that the money come out of the retained earnings of the Water and Sewer account and not be transferred.

749
00:55:19,248 --> 00:55:22,209
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a motion for approval on the floor of the paper that's before us.

750
00:55:22,229 --> 00:55:23,169
[SPEAKER_15]: Point of clarification.

751
00:55:23,850 --> 00:55:24,890
[SPEAKER_15]: Point of clarification.

752
00:55:25,810 --> 00:55:27,952
[SPEAKER_15]: There's no such thing, Vice President Longo-Kearns.

753
00:55:27,972 --> 00:55:28,832
[SPEAKER_17]: Point of information.

754
00:55:29,133 --> 00:55:40,562
[SPEAKER_17]: So Councilor Penser, just so I understand, you're looking to take the 1.4 that were actually in deficit and take it from the retained earnings, therefore not raising the rates of the water and sewer rate payers.

755
00:55:40,582 --> 00:55:41,282
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

756
00:55:41,643 --> 00:55:43,964
[SPEAKER_17]: Point of information.

757
00:55:44,024 --> 00:55:51,931
[SPEAKER_15]: If I could point out that the Water and Sewer Commission has already voted and enacted a rate change.

758
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:54,713
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Camuso, point of information.

759
00:55:55,071 --> 00:55:55,451
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

760
00:55:55,691 --> 00:55:57,793
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and I was going to basically make that point.

761
00:55:57,913 --> 00:56:02,296
[SPEAKER_07]: They actually met before the city council met last week and the paper before us.

762
00:56:03,250 --> 00:56:06,432
[SPEAKER_07]: is to move it from the account he's asking on the other part.

763
00:56:06,913 --> 00:56:12,436
[SPEAKER_07]: So the proper thing, I think, as one voting member of the council, is to move the paper.

764
00:56:13,157 --> 00:56:16,839
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think we made it loud and clear at previous meetings.

765
00:56:16,859 --> 00:56:18,180
[SPEAKER_07]: We wanted it to come out of this.

766
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:25,165
[SPEAKER_07]: But obviously, based upon the data before us, they took that vote last week prior to our committee of the whole.

767
00:56:25,885 --> 00:56:27,466
[SPEAKER_07]: So on this particular paper,

768
00:56:29,401 --> 00:56:37,327
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to not withdraw my motion for approval, because in the sense, in essence, what Councillor Penta is asking to do is take more money out of it.

769
00:56:37,427 --> 00:56:42,592
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have to take this to get to this point now anyway, so.

770
00:56:42,832 --> 00:56:43,933
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

771
00:56:43,953 --> 00:56:46,695
[SPEAKER_15]: And your motion is contradictory to the motion of approval.

772
00:56:50,138 --> 00:56:50,498
[SPEAKER_17]: If I may?

773
00:56:50,558 --> 00:56:52,720
[SPEAKER_15]: Councillor, Vice-President Langel-Kern.

774
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:54,641
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, President Del Rosso.

775
00:56:55,322 --> 00:56:56,323
[SPEAKER_17]: Can you tell us how much is

776
00:56:57,380 --> 00:57:02,745
[SPEAKER_17]: remaining in the retained earnings as of right now before the 700,000 is taken out.

777
00:57:02,765 --> 00:57:04,546
[SPEAKER_17]: I know we went over the numbers last week.

778
00:57:04,586 --> 00:57:09,611
[SPEAKER_22]: I just want to, yes, the total for both water and sewers, approximately $7.7 million.

779
00:57:09,671 --> 00:57:11,752
[SPEAKER_22]: So water retained earnings is at $3,360,000 plus or minus a couple thousand.

780
00:57:11,852 --> 00:57:14,395
[SPEAKER_22]: And then the sewer retained earnings are at

781
00:57:23,266 --> 00:57:24,788
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, I have to do this in my head.

782
00:57:24,808 --> 00:57:27,010
[SPEAKER_22]: $4.76 or $7.8 million.

783
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:35,720
[SPEAKER_22]: And is there a reason why the administration only wanted to take the $700,000 versus a million or the full $1.4?

784
00:57:43,984 --> 00:57:59,114
[SPEAKER_22]: Actually, we did run a number of different scenarios with a consultant, Woodcock and Associates, who are water and sewer rate, and they do other consulting, but they work with water and sewer rates, and ran different options.

785
00:57:59,154 --> 00:58:02,136
[SPEAKER_22]: What would happen if we did not use any of the retained earnings?

786
00:58:02,196 --> 00:58:03,717
[SPEAKER_22]: What would happen in the long term?

787
00:58:04,177 --> 00:58:05,778
[SPEAKER_22]: And what we're looking for are two things.

788
00:58:05,938 --> 00:58:07,619
[SPEAKER_22]: One is rate stability.

789
00:58:08,086 --> 00:58:14,149
[SPEAKER_22]: and also sufficient amount of reserves given the age of the infrastructure in Medford.

790
00:58:15,089 --> 00:58:31,757
[SPEAKER_22]: There are a fair number of water main breaks and other issues with sewer and drainage, so we also asked the consultant what would be prudent to maintain and retain earnings, and this is approximately a little over 10%, almost 15%, I believe, of the operating

791
00:58:35,292 --> 00:58:39,294
[SPEAKER_22]: actually 15, yeah, 15% of the operating budget for each particular fund.

792
00:58:41,515 --> 00:58:41,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

793
00:58:42,615 --> 00:58:48,157
[SPEAKER_17]: Just because I, I mean, I agree with council Penta, why, you know, almost double tax the rate payer.

794
00:58:48,177 --> 00:59:01,343
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, I think this is definitely a good step that we're taking 700,000 out of the retained earnings to be able to, otherwise the rate, the rates would go up, um, double then I guess what they're proposed.

795
00:59:01,860 --> 00:59:07,923
[SPEAKER_17]: What I would want to add is that the Water and Sewer Commission may have voted for this last week, but they were given the number 700,000.

796
00:59:07,963 --> 00:59:10,144
[SPEAKER_17]: They didn't pick it.

797
00:59:10,164 --> 00:59:11,905
[SPEAKER_17]: It was given to them by the administration.

798
00:59:12,385 --> 00:59:27,312
[SPEAKER_17]: And I would just ask that the administration relook at this and possibly give more so that we can keep the rates stable rather than have an increase of, I believe it was a 5% increase once the 700,000 was applied.

799
00:59:30,905 --> 00:59:32,066
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, I believe that's correct.

800
00:59:33,607 --> 00:59:37,509
[SPEAKER_17]: I just would like to, um, lower that increase for the, for the rate payer as well.

801
00:59:37,569 --> 00:59:39,331
[SPEAKER_17]: So I, I see council Penta's point.

802
00:59:39,491 --> 00:59:48,797
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, I understand both sides, but, um, this still, even if we took the full amount, we'd still have 6.3 million left in water and sewer retain earnings.

803
00:59:48,857 --> 00:59:50,498
[SPEAKER_17]: Plus we're going to be adding to it this year.

804
00:59:50,578 --> 00:59:53,039
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's going to probably be back up to at least 7 million.

805
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:59,844
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, I think that's, that's the best step to take, but obviously that's something we have to question the administration on.

806
01:00:01,682 --> 01:00:02,843
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

807
01:00:02,863 --> 01:00:05,244
[SPEAKER_11]: Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

808
01:00:05,484 --> 01:00:06,325
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, Mr. President.

809
01:00:06,345 --> 01:00:07,105
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

810
01:00:07,145 --> 01:00:07,565
[SPEAKER_11]: And Ms.

811
01:00:07,585 --> 01:00:08,966
[SPEAKER_11]: Miller, thank you for your presentation.

812
01:00:09,666 --> 01:00:13,569
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, Woodcock and associates is a consultant, correct?

813
01:00:13,769 --> 01:00:14,289
[SPEAKER_11]: That is correct.

814
01:00:14,389 --> 01:00:19,672
[SPEAKER_11]: And what type, what type of consultant services do they provide now for the city and for the, um, the, the water and sewer commission?

815
01:00:20,152 --> 01:00:30,078
[SPEAKER_22]: They actually, um, provide advice on rates, um, retained earnings, you know, how much should be in retained earnings, those kinds of,

816
01:00:32,446 --> 01:00:42,550
[SPEAKER_11]: And based upon our discussions that we had last week, one of the things that came up was that Woodcock and Associates recommends that we would maintain between 25% and 50% of our water sewer budget and reserves.

817
01:00:42,610 --> 01:00:43,150
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that correct?

818
01:00:43,370 --> 01:00:44,790
[SPEAKER_22]: That is correct.

819
01:00:46,331 --> 01:00:47,331
[SPEAKER_22]: This is on the low end.

820
01:00:47,652 --> 01:00:48,992
[SPEAKER_11]: We're on the lower end at this point in time.

821
01:00:49,052 --> 01:00:50,773
[SPEAKER_22]: We are on the lower end at this point in time.

822
01:00:51,709 --> 01:00:58,251
[SPEAKER_11]: So if we make this appropriation, what you're saying is that we'll be at about 15% of our total operating budget for water and sewer and our retained earnings.

823
01:00:58,291 --> 01:01:05,193
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'd still be 10% below what it is that is recommended from our consultant?

824
01:01:06,593 --> 01:01:08,834
[SPEAKER_22]: That is correct based upon what he said last week.

825
01:01:08,954 --> 01:01:18,897
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, right now we don't have a retained earnings policy and they caution also that different towns and cities approach it very differently.

826
01:01:20,051 --> 01:01:21,573
[SPEAKER_22]: So, you are correct.

827
01:01:21,973 --> 01:01:26,359
[SPEAKER_22]: This is below what they stated their recommendation was.

828
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:34,550
[SPEAKER_11]: And did they not also state that in terms of surrounding communities and communities that we're comparable with, we are in the middle of the road right now in terms of what we have in our reserves?

829
01:01:34,630 --> 01:01:34,931
[SPEAKER_22]: We are.

830
01:01:34,951 --> 01:01:35,431
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, we are.

831
01:01:35,491 --> 01:01:35,592
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

832
01:01:35,832 --> 01:01:36,052
[SPEAKER_11]: Excellent.

833
01:01:36,072 --> 01:01:36,513
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

834
01:01:36,533 --> 01:01:37,074
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate it.

835
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:40,978
[SPEAKER_15]: Point of information, Madam Vice President.

836
01:01:40,998 --> 01:01:42,879
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, President de la Rousseau.

837
01:01:43,339 --> 01:01:46,381
[SPEAKER_17]: I asked that question, I believe, and that was my question.

838
01:01:46,401 --> 01:01:51,764
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe he said we'd be at 25% to 30% once this $700,000 is taken.

839
01:01:54,265 --> 01:01:57,406
[SPEAKER_17]: He said we'd still be at that level once $700,000 was taken.

840
01:01:59,528 --> 01:02:00,728
[SPEAKER_17]: That was my specific question.

841
01:02:00,788 --> 01:02:04,210
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not sure if you could just clarify that.

842
01:02:06,197 --> 01:02:06,477
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

843
01:02:06,637 --> 01:02:10,398
[SPEAKER_22]: I may, I may have the numbers wrong, but I thought we would end up being a little bit lower after that.

844
01:02:10,418 --> 01:02:10,398
26%.

845
01:02:10,638 --> 01:02:14,899
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought it was that he thought he would, that we would be at 26% 700,000.

846
01:02:15,519 --> 01:02:17,179
[SPEAKER_11]: I would still be closer to 20, 26%, 25%.

847
01:02:17,479 --> 01:02:18,259
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

848
01:02:18,339 --> 01:02:20,940
[SPEAKER_22]: I may have the numbers wrong.

849
01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:21,520
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

850
01:02:21,580 --> 01:02:23,280
[SPEAKER_22]: I may be recalling the numbers incorrectly.

851
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:27,641
[SPEAKER_16]: Are we okay?

852
01:02:27,681 --> 01:02:33,262
[SPEAKER_22]: I actually don't have the operating budget in front of me, but I know that the assessments alone are close to,

853
01:02:34,507 --> 01:02:43,952
[SPEAKER_22]: $17 million for both water and sewer $18 million plus at least another five or six for the remainder of the budget.

854
01:02:44,712 --> 01:02:46,153
[SPEAKER_22]: Chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

855
01:02:47,894 --> 01:02:48,294
[SPEAKER_24]: You all done?

856
01:02:48,354 --> 01:02:48,854
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm all done.

857
01:02:49,955 --> 01:02:50,235
[SPEAKER_24]: Yep.

858
01:02:50,375 --> 01:02:51,376
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Mr. President.

859
01:02:51,616 --> 01:02:59,780
[SPEAKER_24]: Uh, geez, I remember the days with the water and sewer where we were in deficit every year and we didn't have any money in the retained earnings.

860
01:03:00,495 --> 01:03:10,818
[SPEAKER_24]: And I never heard Mr. Woodcock, who's been on board for a number of years as a consultant, saying, hey, Method, you better beef up your retained earnings because there's not enough money in that account.

861
01:03:11,759 --> 01:03:13,019
[SPEAKER_24]: But now I'm hearing the reverse.

862
01:03:13,099 --> 01:03:24,063
[SPEAKER_24]: We have six or seven million built up, and Mr. Woodcock is telling us, make sure you don't spend any of that money because we don't want to tap into the reserves below a certain amount.

863
01:03:24,903 --> 01:03:26,663
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, I don't buy into that, first of all.

864
01:03:27,024 --> 01:03:28,284
[SPEAKER_24]: I happen to have attended

865
01:03:28,878 --> 01:03:33,300
[SPEAKER_24]: uh, the meeting of the water and sewer commissioners, uh, last week prior to our meeting.

866
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:41,684
[SPEAKER_24]: And, uh, I found it very interesting that, um, and as the budget director, I think, uh, I think you were present at the meeting also.

867
01:03:41,784 --> 01:03:50,848
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, one of the issues, uh, which was brought up by the chairman of the water and sewer commission, uh, Mr. Dominic Camara, uh, he had a very valid point.

868
01:03:51,648 --> 01:03:58,151
[SPEAKER_24]: Uh, he said, why, uh, is it not in the city's budget for a water and sewer expense

869
01:03:59,025 --> 01:04:01,826
[SPEAKER_24]: on the municipal side and on the school side.

870
01:04:03,146 --> 01:04:05,306
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's a very, very valid point.

871
01:04:06,347 --> 01:04:07,127
[SPEAKER_24]: That's a utility.

872
01:04:07,147 --> 01:04:12,348
[SPEAKER_24]: As far as I'm concerned, it's a utility like gas, like oil, like electricity.

873
01:04:13,008 --> 01:04:25,090
[SPEAKER_24]: And how can you have, for instance, I believe it was last year, $550,000 in water and sewer from the municipality, and that includes the school side.

874
01:04:25,510 --> 01:04:28,531
[SPEAKER_24]: That's a half a million dollars that's not in the budget.

875
01:04:28,979 --> 01:04:31,320
[SPEAKER_24]: you're not accounting for in an operating budget.

876
01:04:32,421 --> 01:04:40,885
[SPEAKER_24]: Now, if you had a budget at your house, could you leave out a portion of that size and say, well, I'm not, you know, water's really not part of my utilities?

877
01:04:41,325 --> 01:04:43,086
[SPEAKER_24]: Of course it's part of your operating budget.

878
01:04:43,647 --> 01:04:55,453
[SPEAKER_24]: So how does a city not include a half a million dollars that they know is going to be accounted for, or in this case, we refer to it as unaccounted for because it's not needed.

879
01:04:56,153 --> 01:04:57,634
[SPEAKER_24]: So I'm not quite sure.

880
01:04:58,164 --> 01:05:05,588
[SPEAKER_24]: And, and Mr. Kamara raised a very valid point, uh, cause he mentioned, and I've been preaching about this for several years now.

881
01:05:05,988 --> 01:05:15,852
[SPEAKER_24]: Cause I remember the days when I was on the school committee, like Mr. Scott Pelly and Mr. Falco that are here tonight, uh, where the water and sewer were in the school budget.

882
01:05:16,473 --> 01:05:21,455
[SPEAKER_24]: And then I don't know what happened, but miraculously one given year it was gone.

883
01:05:22,111 --> 01:05:24,533
[SPEAKER_24]: It never appeared as a line item anymore in the budget.

884
01:05:24,933 --> 01:05:26,574
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know who made that recommendation.

885
01:05:26,935 --> 01:05:28,356
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know who took it out of the budget.

886
01:05:28,896 --> 01:05:33,600
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't ever remember a vote on it, but all of a sudden, it was never in the budget again.

887
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:50,813
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think one recommendation we should be making, Mr. President, as a council, is that the city administration put back the water and sewer cost, the real cost, for every school in this city, for every municipal building in this city,

888
01:05:51,163 --> 01:05:58,046
[SPEAKER_24]: So we can have a direct accounting for that particular expense in every operating budget.

889
01:05:58,446 --> 01:06:05,110
[SPEAKER_24]: There's no reason why we shouldn't account for water and sewer that we know is going to be a direct expense, Mr. President.

890
01:06:05,530 --> 01:06:08,511
[SPEAKER_24]: So that would be one recommendation that I ask.

891
01:06:09,592 --> 01:06:10,572
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry to interrupt.

892
01:06:10,592 --> 01:06:13,814
[SPEAKER_15]: So is that a recommendation or an amendment to the motion of approval?

893
01:06:13,914 --> 01:06:15,515
[SPEAKER_24]: I would ask it to be an amendment.

894
01:06:15,535 --> 01:06:16,655
[SPEAKER_24]: We have the budget director here.

895
01:06:16,675 --> 01:06:18,256
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know how she feels on that.

896
01:06:18,276 --> 01:06:19,917
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't expect her to answer that tonight.

897
01:06:21,110 --> 01:06:32,795
[SPEAKER_24]: I could just tell you that, you know, the days of underfunding our snow and ice, when we know we're going to spend $800,000 and only put $200,000 in the budget, that's a concern.

898
01:06:33,615 --> 01:06:36,396
[SPEAKER_24]: I know we could run a deficit in that account, but it's a concern.

899
01:06:37,397 --> 01:06:40,838
[SPEAKER_24]: And, you know, when you have water expense in the school department,

900
01:06:41,268 --> 01:06:42,348
[SPEAKER_24]: and they don't have to pay for it.

901
01:06:42,548 --> 01:06:43,789
[SPEAKER_24]: Who pays for it, Mr. President?

902
01:06:44,029 --> 01:06:44,569
[SPEAKER_24]: Where does it go?

903
01:06:44,589 --> 01:06:45,830
[SPEAKER_24]: It just doesn't vanish.

904
01:06:46,510 --> 01:06:48,571
[SPEAKER_24]: It goes for unaccounted for water.

905
01:06:48,951 --> 01:06:57,994
[SPEAKER_24]: And all of our rates, we end up paying it no matter what anyways, but all of our rates get raised because of the unaccounted for water that Councilor Pinto has been talking about.

906
01:06:58,614 --> 01:07:09,438
[SPEAKER_24]: Now, one of the reasons why we're having an increase in, or a deficit, I should say, is the fact that we moved the tier one from zero

907
01:07:10,327 --> 01:07:13,788
[SPEAKER_24]: from 0 to 800 to 0 to 1,000 cubic feet.

908
01:07:15,268 --> 01:07:25,310
[SPEAKER_24]: And what we did was, in effect, take anyone that was using 900, 1,000 cubic feet that were paying a higher rate, we put them into the lower rate.

909
01:07:25,931 --> 01:07:27,651
[SPEAKER_24]: And we lost revenue by doing that.

910
01:07:28,811 --> 01:07:31,012
[SPEAKER_24]: And that was the decision that was made.

911
01:07:31,552 --> 01:07:35,273
[SPEAKER_24]: And now I believe we're going to go back to the 0 to 800.

912
01:07:36,686 --> 01:07:38,767
[SPEAKER_24]: That is what the commissioners voted.

913
01:07:38,807 --> 01:07:39,268
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

914
01:07:39,388 --> 01:07:40,748
[SPEAKER_24]: That was one of the recommendations.

915
01:07:40,808 --> 01:07:52,495
[SPEAKER_24]: So clearly that recommendation, uh, didn't work in regards to, uh, maintaining rates within our community or at least having a way to pay for a water and sewer in our community.

916
01:07:52,936 --> 01:07:55,717
[SPEAKER_24]: And I agree with, uh, council Penter and council Longo.

917
01:07:56,158 --> 01:07:58,519
[SPEAKER_24]: If the money's there, we have $7 million.

918
01:07:58,639 --> 01:08:04,983
[SPEAKER_24]: Uh, I don't think that's going to make a hill of beans on any barn rating in our community to take that money,

919
01:08:05,353 --> 01:08:09,054
[SPEAKER_24]: And there's only two purposes you can use it for, the retained earnings.

920
01:08:09,454 --> 01:08:11,195
[SPEAKER_24]: It's in state statute, anyone can read it.

921
01:08:11,735 --> 01:08:15,757
[SPEAKER_24]: It's to offset rates, and it's for infrastructure improvements.

922
01:08:16,257 --> 01:08:26,721
[SPEAKER_24]: You can't use it for anything else unless you file special home rule petition, like the mayor did back some years ago, to offset a budget deficit, but that's a whole other issue.

923
01:08:27,081 --> 01:08:28,881
[SPEAKER_24]: But it can only be used for those two purposes.

924
01:08:29,262 --> 01:08:31,802
[SPEAKER_24]: This is a legitimate purpose to use the money for.

925
01:08:32,283 --> 01:08:33,243
[SPEAKER_24]: And to sit back and say,

926
01:08:33,799 --> 01:08:35,560
[SPEAKER_24]: We don't want to touch that account.

927
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:38,361
[SPEAKER_24]: The mayor's state of the city speech over the weekend.

928
01:08:38,661 --> 01:08:41,142
[SPEAKER_24]: He was bragging about all the surplus money we have.

929
01:08:41,803 --> 01:08:43,063
[SPEAKER_24]: The city's in great shape.

930
01:08:43,123 --> 01:08:44,384
[SPEAKER_24]: We have all the surplus money.

931
01:08:44,764 --> 01:08:48,166
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, it's the taxpayers' money the mayor's sitting on.

932
01:08:48,706 --> 01:08:59,010
[SPEAKER_24]: And to use other resources to pay when we already have an account specifically earmarked for that type of reason, I can't in good faith vote for it.

933
01:08:59,671 --> 01:09:00,191
[SPEAKER_24]: I really can't.

934
01:09:00,211 --> 01:09:02,412
[SPEAKER_24]: So I agree with my two colleagues that

935
01:09:03,013 --> 01:09:04,734
[SPEAKER_24]: The money should come out of retained earnings.

936
01:09:05,455 --> 01:09:07,296
[SPEAKER_24]: That's not going to impact our bond rating.

937
01:09:07,816 --> 01:09:17,242
[SPEAKER_24]: And you better believe, as Councilor Longo said, within the next several months, we're going to see an increase in the retained earnings on both the water and sewer side.

938
01:09:17,763 --> 01:09:19,264
[SPEAKER_24]: So those are my thoughts, Mr. President.

939
01:09:19,764 --> 01:09:25,348
[SPEAKER_24]: And the budget should be a realistic budget that reflects the actual operating expenses.

940
01:09:25,748 --> 01:09:31,792
[SPEAKER_24]: And to take out water and sewer and say that's not an operating expense, I believe is being short-sighted.

941
01:09:32,366 --> 01:09:48,134
[SPEAKER_24]: And, uh, I think, uh, you know, the city should, uh, start, uh, creating budgets that are realistic, uh, budgets and budgets that are attainable and not budgets that have hidden, uh, you know, trap doors at every, uh, term is the president.

942
01:09:51,356 --> 01:09:53,998
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. President, if I may, um, I want to thank councilor Marks.

943
01:09:54,038 --> 01:09:55,318
[SPEAKER_22]: He reminded me as well.

944
01:09:55,398 --> 01:09:58,240
[SPEAKER_22]: The other reason why the, um, there was a,

945
01:09:59,016 --> 01:10:03,079
[SPEAKER_22]: shortfall in the water and sewer budgets is also because of water conservation.

946
01:10:03,540 --> 01:10:12,166
[SPEAKER_22]: With the tiered rates came additional water conservation and we should see the result of that in the coming years with our MWRA water assessment.

947
01:10:12,427 --> 01:10:15,569
[SPEAKER_22]: It will not affect the sewer assessment, but it will affect our water assessment.

948
01:10:16,830 --> 01:10:18,932
[SPEAKER_24]: So, so Mr. President, yes, counsel.

949
01:10:19,472 --> 01:10:23,015
[SPEAKER_24]: So based on a con, this is what I don't understand about this.

950
01:10:23,696 --> 01:10:27,078
[SPEAKER_24]: If we can serve, we still get the same bill from the MWRA.

951
01:10:27,258 --> 01:10:27,919
[SPEAKER_24]: That's correct.

952
01:10:28,632 --> 01:10:31,074
[SPEAKER_24]: So it's great to do conservation.

953
01:10:31,294 --> 01:10:32,495
[SPEAKER_24]: I support it wholeheartedly.

954
01:10:33,075 --> 01:10:37,699
[SPEAKER_24]: But when do we tell the ratepayer that there'll be some type of relief?

955
01:10:38,159 --> 01:10:41,902
[SPEAKER_24]: Most people attribute, I use less water, I'm going to pay less.

956
01:10:42,582 --> 01:10:43,523
[SPEAKER_24]: But that's not the case.

957
01:10:44,244 --> 01:10:44,964
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not the case.

958
01:10:45,345 --> 01:10:55,212
[SPEAKER_24]: And even when we do a better job with I&I inflow and infiltration and relining our pipes and so forth, we could decrease I&I by 10 percent.

959
01:10:55,703 --> 01:10:59,966
[SPEAKER_24]: But if every other community decreases it by 20%, we still pay extra.

960
01:11:00,226 --> 01:11:00,886
[SPEAKER_24]: That's correct.

961
01:11:01,147 --> 01:11:03,528
[SPEAKER_24]: It just, it's crazy.

962
01:11:04,029 --> 01:11:06,230
[SPEAKER_24]: It really, it makes no sense.

963
01:11:07,231 --> 01:11:08,632
[SPEAKER_24]: You can never get ahead of the game.

964
01:11:09,452 --> 01:11:18,078
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, you can never offer, we thought with the second meter outside, you know, people are going to be able to save when they water their lawns or when they fill up their pool.

965
01:11:18,729 --> 01:11:20,970
[SPEAKER_24]: And talk to anyone that has a second meter outside.

966
01:11:21,690 --> 01:11:23,190
[SPEAKER_24]: They'll tell you there's no savings at all.

967
01:11:23,730 --> 01:11:30,812
[SPEAKER_24]: If anything, they had to spend $500 to put the meter in, they have to spend extra money to have it tested, and so forth.

968
01:11:31,252 --> 01:11:38,133
[SPEAKER_24]: So, you know, all these different ways of taking the burden off the ratepayer really is fruitless.

969
01:11:38,753 --> 01:11:42,394
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, I don't see any way you conserve, you pay extra.

970
01:11:42,414 --> 01:11:46,095
[SPEAKER_24]: You do a better job with fixing your infrastructure, you still end up paying extra.

971
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:48,275
[SPEAKER_24]: How do you get around this?

972
01:11:48,675 --> 01:11:55,177
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not a question for you, but as a city, I think we have to take a look at this, because this is not chump change we're talking about.

973
01:11:55,597 --> 01:12:01,158
[SPEAKER_24]: This is millions and millions of dollars, and it's millions in surplus, Mr. President.

974
01:12:04,099 --> 01:12:09,380
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of approval by Councilor Camuso, as amended by Councilor Marks, the Chair recognizes Councilor Penta.

975
01:12:09,820 --> 01:12:12,941
[SPEAKER_23]: Mr. President, I agree with Councilor Marks and my colleague Councilor Langel-Kern.

976
01:12:13,701 --> 01:12:15,342
[SPEAKER_23]: The interesting part, you were at that meeting,

977
01:12:16,487 --> 01:12:18,829
[SPEAKER_23]: Louise, as it relates to the conservation.

978
01:12:18,949 --> 01:12:19,870
[SPEAKER_23]: What did the commissioner say?

979
01:12:19,890 --> 01:12:24,354
[SPEAKER_23]: That the sad part about this whole thing, the people are conserving more, but they're going to have to be paying more.

980
01:12:24,975 --> 01:12:27,016
[SPEAKER_23]: So the ball bounces itself back and forth.

981
01:12:27,036 --> 01:12:30,720
[SPEAKER_23]: This goes back to almost like the green barrel before you got here, the green barrel issue.

982
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:42,510
[SPEAKER_23]: When we got into these green barrels and we get into this whole idea of being conservation and recycling, and we have the two different size barrels here, but what happens here to the city of Medford because of the recycling, which cuts down on the hardcore,

983
01:12:43,795 --> 01:12:53,100
[SPEAKER_23]: The waste that cost the city, I think it was last year, $159,000 more, because even though we were recycling more, we went from three to 30%, it still cost the city more.

984
01:12:55,041 --> 01:12:58,143
[SPEAKER_23]: And people just need to understand something.

985
01:12:58,183 --> 01:13:02,845
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, if you're going to use less, why are you paying more?

986
01:13:03,886 --> 01:13:07,108
[SPEAKER_23]: So some people may get the attitude, if I'm going to pay for them, I should just use it.

987
01:13:07,588 --> 01:13:10,549
[SPEAKER_23]: So the whole conservation theme, it's going to be lost.

988
01:13:11,310 --> 01:13:13,311
[SPEAKER_23]: The other part of the issue is that, again,

989
01:13:14,082 --> 01:13:22,988
[SPEAKER_23]: It's $7.7 million of tax payers, rate payers money that's been sitting there with no major projects on ready to go.

990
01:13:23,708 --> 01:13:24,849
[SPEAKER_23]: Nowhere, nowhere to go.

991
01:13:25,249 --> 01:13:26,450
[SPEAKER_23]: And the law is very succinct.

992
01:13:26,750 --> 01:13:29,932
[SPEAKER_23]: It's either 90 days ready to go or it goes back to the rate payers.

993
01:13:30,473 --> 01:13:34,395
[SPEAKER_23]: Now we know that there's a projected rate increase coming in this year from the MWRA.

994
01:13:35,036 --> 01:13:36,116
[SPEAKER_23]: Who's going to eat that again?

995
01:13:36,236 --> 01:13:37,297
[SPEAKER_23]: It's going to be the rate payers.

996
01:13:37,918 --> 01:13:41,660
[SPEAKER_23]: So it's bad enough that they're going to have to pay for the increase to the water and sewer.

997
01:13:42,171 --> 01:13:42,471
[SPEAKER_23]: system.

998
01:13:42,531 --> 01:13:46,713
[SPEAKER_23]: And I understand you have to pay for salaries and all the contract negotiations that take place.

999
01:13:47,253 --> 01:13:54,296
[SPEAKER_23]: But when you're sitting on the surplus like this, there was no reason why the rate payer, the rate payers should get involved in paying off whatever the difference might be.

1000
01:13:54,556 --> 01:13:58,278
[SPEAKER_23]: Councilor Marks just alluded to something a few years ago and kudos to him.

1001
01:13:58,318 --> 01:14:10,022
[SPEAKER_23]: He was the only council that voted against taking a million point one ballot, a million point $100,000 out of the water and sewer account to offset the mayor's budget deficit to balance his proposed budget.

1002
01:14:10,723 --> 01:14:11,323
[SPEAKER_23]: And he was right.

1003
01:14:11,673 --> 01:14:12,593
[SPEAKER_23]: It should have never been done.

1004
01:14:13,033 --> 01:14:16,854
[SPEAKER_23]: First and only time in the legislature, first and last time it's going to be done.

1005
01:14:17,654 --> 01:14:19,015
[SPEAKER_23]: This is the rate payers' money.

1006
01:14:19,335 --> 01:14:22,155
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, it's bad enough you've got them with the Republic kiosk parking.

1007
01:14:22,815 --> 01:14:26,876
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, you're hitting them in every single corner here with attacks and attacks.

1008
01:14:28,196 --> 01:14:32,077
[SPEAKER_23]: And their streets, their roads, their bridges and everything is just in a state of chaos.

1009
01:14:33,517 --> 01:14:36,158
[SPEAKER_23]: I just cannot in good conscience go forward with this.

1010
01:14:36,198 --> 01:14:37,318
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm not going to support it.

1011
01:14:38,358 --> 01:14:39,199
[SPEAKER_23]: It doesn't belong.

1012
01:14:39,219 --> 01:14:40,679
[SPEAKER_23]: It doesn't belong here right now.

1013
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:48,544
[SPEAKER_23]: And until the city can get its act together financially as to where it needs to go, how it needs to resolve this water and soil situation, so be it.

1014
01:14:48,684 --> 01:14:50,205
[SPEAKER_23]: There are so many options here.

1015
01:14:51,065 --> 01:14:54,427
[SPEAKER_23]: You have a consultant that tells you you're in a deficit, you gotta start saving.

1016
01:14:54,787 --> 01:14:57,749
[SPEAKER_23]: And then when you start saving, you gotta save more than what you're saving.

1017
01:14:58,649 --> 01:15:02,631
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't care about other cities and towns, and I don't care about our bond rating.

1018
01:15:03,271 --> 01:15:09,855
[SPEAKER_23]: What I care about is having taxpayers spend too much money on more than being charged for more than what's necessary.

1019
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:12,661
[SPEAKER_23]: Life is not too easy right now.

1020
01:15:12,901 --> 01:15:15,543
[SPEAKER_23]: You may hear all kinds of great stories out there about the economy.

1021
01:15:15,963 --> 01:15:17,063
[SPEAKER_23]: People are still struggling.

1022
01:15:17,123 --> 01:15:20,725
[SPEAKER_23]: People are still out there that haven't received raises in five and six years.

1023
01:15:21,166 --> 01:15:26,448
[SPEAKER_23]: The employees in this building and citywide and the school department, they should be thankful they have their jobs.

1024
01:15:27,729 --> 01:15:28,930
[SPEAKER_23]: Thankful they have their jobs.

1025
01:15:29,870 --> 01:15:33,692
[SPEAKER_23]: And they shouldn't be complaining about, you know, we're not getting enough of a percentage here.

1026
01:15:33,732 --> 01:15:34,393
[SPEAKER_23]: They're everywhere.

1027
01:15:34,693 --> 01:15:35,953
[SPEAKER_23]: You want to negotiate in good faith?

1028
01:15:35,993 --> 01:15:36,994
[SPEAKER_23]: I've got no problem in that.

1029
01:15:37,594 --> 01:15:38,735
[SPEAKER_23]: But don't go out and hit the people.

1030
01:15:39,173 --> 01:15:49,580
[SPEAKER_23]: that don't have that job security, that haven't gotten that pay raise in two or three years, and knowingly should not have to pay for this deficit that, unfortunately, was created by a miscalculation.

1031
01:15:50,701 --> 01:15:53,863
[SPEAKER_23]: I won't say it was intentional, but an unintentional miscalculation.

1032
01:15:53,883 --> 01:15:57,726
[SPEAKER_23]: So you're going to have to go back to the drawing boards and revisit it, you know.

1033
01:15:58,206 --> 01:16:00,968
[SPEAKER_23]: And that's the best way I can say it, Mr. President.

1034
01:16:00,988 --> 01:16:04,891
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, I don't think — you know, when this council — I think it was two budgets ago — voted $660,000 to be taken out of the budget.

1035
01:16:07,425 --> 01:16:12,668
[SPEAKER_23]: to not to absorb the water, 9% water rate increase from the MWRA that particular year.

1036
01:16:12,888 --> 01:16:13,608
[SPEAKER_23]: The mayor went nuts.

1037
01:16:13,628 --> 01:16:21,112
[SPEAKER_23]: He didn't like that whole idea and he chastised us and he had all kinds of press releases sent out that we were, you know, weren't good people.

1038
01:16:21,172 --> 01:16:22,893
[SPEAKER_23]: We were against the taxpayers and this and that.

1039
01:16:23,254 --> 01:16:26,896
[SPEAKER_23]: We were for the taxpayers back then because that's what the money should have come out of.

1040
01:16:27,716 --> 01:16:34,940
[SPEAKER_23]: And unbeknownst to us, we didn't know that that 9% was taking place until the budget vote on that just before the budget was going to be proposed in that particular time.

1041
01:16:35,842 --> 01:16:37,463
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, Louise, you gave us this ahead of time.

1042
01:16:37,504 --> 01:16:48,013
[SPEAKER_23]: I got no problem with that, but I can't support it in good conscience, knowing that that kind of a deficit is sitting there and knowing and just thinking about what's going on in the school department.

1043
01:16:48,774 --> 01:17:00,824
[SPEAKER_23]: With all the new jobs that were just created this past year, over $500,000 in new administrative jobs, a $7,000 salary increase to someone because they're retiring to give them their highest three years.

1044
01:17:01,264 --> 01:17:12,192
[SPEAKER_23]: And when people start hearing that and knowing that those type of salaries are going out there, and when we're sitting on $7 million of their money, and they have to pay for raising their water and sewer rates, it's unacceptable.

1045
01:17:12,593 --> 01:17:15,555
[SPEAKER_23]: It doesn't fly by me, and I cannot and I will not support it.

1046
01:17:17,804 --> 01:17:21,065
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, I support that the entire money comes out of the water and sewer account.

1047
01:17:23,026 --> 01:17:23,987
[SPEAKER_23]: But he says you can't do it.

1048
01:17:25,768 --> 01:17:27,228
[SPEAKER_23]: I'd like to amend the motion, Mr. President.

1049
01:17:27,969 --> 01:17:33,251
[SPEAKER_23]: Amend the main motion that the entire deficit of whatever it might be comes out of the retained earnings of the water and sewer account.

1050
01:17:35,772 --> 01:17:37,433
[SPEAKER_23]: And the amendment supersedes the main motion.

1051
01:17:40,334 --> 01:17:40,694
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, you do.

1052
01:17:41,455 --> 01:17:42,075
[SPEAKER_23]: It's an amendment.

1053
01:17:44,385 --> 01:17:45,025
[SPEAKER_23]: Move the question.

1054
01:17:45,045 --> 01:17:54,990
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President will be on the, uh, main motion for approval by councilor Camuso as amended by vice president Longo current and counselor marks.

1055
01:17:56,651 --> 01:18:03,274
[SPEAKER_15]: And secondly, the B paper contrary to the, uh, main motion offered by councilor Penta.

1056
01:18:03,934 --> 01:18:07,636
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, before we do that, we have a citizen who wishes to address the council.

1057
01:18:08,196 --> 01:18:11,217
[SPEAKER_15]: If, uh, chair recognizes, uh, counselor night.

1058
01:18:12,458 --> 01:18:12,538
[SPEAKER_11]: Um,

1059
01:18:13,644 --> 01:18:19,807
[SPEAKER_11]: If I'm understanding the motion that's on the floor, regardless, we're going to have to appropriate the money that's before us right now in this paper.

1060
01:18:19,827 --> 01:18:20,368
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1061
01:18:21,008 --> 01:18:25,150
[SPEAKER_11]: So why don't we act on that and then worry about the rest of it at a later time?

1062
01:18:25,551 --> 01:18:27,952
[SPEAKER_11]: The amendment proceeds the main motion.

1063
01:18:28,032 --> 01:18:28,572
[SPEAKER_11]: No, that's fine.

1064
01:18:28,592 --> 01:18:30,893
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just trying to make it.

1065
01:18:31,033 --> 01:18:35,236
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, we all have a similar, you know, we were all okay with spending the 700,000.

1066
01:18:36,196 --> 01:18:38,798
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the excess of 700,000 that we're not all okay with.

1067
01:18:39,018 --> 01:18:39,278
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1068
01:18:42,805 --> 01:18:44,287
[SPEAKER_15]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1069
01:18:44,567 --> 01:18:45,628
[SPEAKER_12]: My name is Michael Majuro.

1070
01:18:45,668 --> 01:18:47,189
[SPEAKER_12]: I live on 18 Pembroke Street.

1071
01:18:47,609 --> 01:18:49,811
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to speak really quickly about this rate increase.

1072
01:18:50,592 --> 01:18:56,196
[SPEAKER_12]: I am very much in favor of taking the entire amount out of retained earnings, and here's why.

1073
01:18:56,797 --> 01:18:59,819
[SPEAKER_12]: First, I want to bring up the point that Councilman Mark brought up.

1074
01:18:59,859 --> 01:19:03,262
[SPEAKER_12]: It feels sort of like rate pairs of playing three-card Monte.

1075
01:19:03,683 --> 01:19:07,746
[SPEAKER_12]: You know the game where you have three cups and one ball, and no matter what you do, you just can't seem to find it.

1076
01:19:07,806 --> 01:19:10,068
[SPEAKER_12]: It seems to be the same game that's going on here.

1077
01:19:10,549 --> 01:19:13,531
[SPEAKER_12]: We choose one option of, well, we'll just conserve more.

1078
01:19:13,851 --> 01:19:16,293
[SPEAKER_12]: Nope, rate pace is still going to go up.

1079
01:19:16,373 --> 01:19:24,157
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's make it so that we have actually this huge bonus to make sure that we can withdraw from in cases that there is an overage.

1080
01:19:24,558 --> 01:19:25,638
[SPEAKER_12]: Nope, that doesn't work either.

1081
01:19:26,259 --> 01:19:30,261
[SPEAKER_12]: A 5% increase is very onerous for a lot of people in this community.

1082
01:19:30,881 --> 01:19:36,585
[SPEAKER_12]: It has to be probably one of the top three complaints I hear in the city, especially in the senior center.

1083
01:19:37,307 --> 01:19:40,949
[SPEAKER_12]: It might not seem like a huge increase for a lot of people, but it can really hurt.

1084
01:19:41,689 --> 01:19:47,451
[SPEAKER_12]: There is no reason why we shouldn't take the money that we already have currently in surplus, and here's why.

1085
01:19:47,471 --> 01:19:51,633
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the best reason why we should use the money that we already have reserved

1086
01:19:52,115 --> 01:19:54,976
[SPEAKER_12]: is that's the skin in the game that the city already has.

1087
01:19:55,796 --> 01:20:08,598
[SPEAKER_12]: If that number keeps going down, then we're going to be the force to address perhaps the leaks that are causing these huge rate increases, or perhaps just looking at where the schools are and why they're using more than they should.

1088
01:20:09,078 --> 01:20:11,239
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe that's where the conservation needs to be looked at.

1089
01:20:11,779 --> 01:20:17,420
[SPEAKER_12]: So I strongly suggest that we should take this money out of retained earnings

1090
01:20:18,018 --> 01:20:24,862
[SPEAKER_12]: to have it go on the rate payer who are actually already conserving is an onerous, and it's going to be difficult for many seniors.

1091
01:20:25,082 --> 01:20:25,382
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1092
01:20:28,884 --> 01:20:29,224
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1093
01:20:29,264 --> 01:20:30,845
[SPEAKER_15]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1094
01:20:30,905 --> 01:20:31,205
[SPEAKER_15]: Welcome.

1095
01:20:31,585 --> 01:20:32,486
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Council President.

1096
01:20:32,826 --> 01:20:35,467
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilor Neddy, Andrew, Cushing Street, Method Mass.

1097
01:20:36,088 --> 01:20:45,453
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilor Marks brought up a point about, I think it's tier one, and thanks to Councilor Pinto, I believe it was increased

1098
01:20:46,244 --> 01:21:02,937
[SPEAKER_00]: for a single-family usage from 800 to 1,000 units of... Anyways, I'm not sure how to feel about this before your decision for the vote.

1099
01:21:03,598 --> 01:21:15,587
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it seems like these water bills, the new tiered system that went into effect a few years back, and I'm not sure if the state set those numbers with the tiered

1100
01:21:16,163 --> 01:21:35,517
[SPEAKER_00]: But it seems like it adds insult to injury to the ratepayer for water in the MWRA system, because Tier 1 is for, I believe, single-family usage, and it's X amount, like let's just say 12 cents per gallon or whatever it is.

1101
01:21:35,937 --> 01:21:42,942
[SPEAKER_00]: However, Tier 2 allows more, and that's at a little bit higher cost, a cent more.

1102
01:21:46,375 --> 01:21:58,581
[SPEAKER_00]: Tier 3, that was not really the third because they called it un-tiered for the next highest price, which is fine.

1103
01:21:59,461 --> 01:22:04,283
[SPEAKER_00]: However, Tier 3 is higher than the un-tiered.

1104
01:22:05,844 --> 01:22:06,064
[SPEAKER_00]: Well,

1105
01:22:06,457 --> 01:22:17,061
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a three-family, in effect, is paying more per gallon than all others outside of a one, two, or three-family home.

1106
01:22:18,001 --> 01:22:33,246
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is businesses, commercial, industrial, maybe, otherwise it has something to do with lobbying the state house to pass this law and its tiered structure, whether it was the state's doing or the local doing.

1107
01:22:34,155 --> 01:22:37,898
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like it's as insult to further rape as injuries.

1108
01:22:38,278 --> 01:22:38,658
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1109
01:22:39,198 --> 01:22:40,339
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. Castagnet.

1110
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:43,161
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of approval by Councilor Caviello.

1111
01:22:43,381 --> 01:22:43,942
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1112
01:22:43,962 --> 01:22:44,462
[SPEAKER_15]: My apologies.

1113
01:22:45,203 --> 01:22:54,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, the bill we get from the MWRA is not just for water, but the MWRA is constantly doing improvements throughout the whole system.

1114
01:22:55,249 --> 01:23:00,513
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think our share of the bill this year was like $23.5 million that we have to pay, am I correct?

1115
01:23:01,940 --> 01:23:02,921
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't recall.

1116
01:23:03,221 --> 01:23:04,242
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's somewhere around that.

1117
01:23:04,302 --> 01:23:15,528
[SPEAKER_02]: And the MWRA, let's say they do, say along with the water and the leaks and everything else, but they said that the system is constantly being upgraded and that's part of the money.

1118
01:23:15,568 --> 01:23:23,994
[SPEAKER_02]: And they said, all we know is, the MWRA, similar to like the tiered thing, here's your bill, you figure out how to pay it.

1119
01:23:24,654 --> 01:23:25,935
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's pretty much how it works.

1120
01:23:26,975 --> 01:23:29,737
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, NSA, I know we tried the tiered system and

1121
01:23:30,435 --> 01:23:32,096
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't have any history to go on that.

1122
01:23:32,956 --> 01:23:40,139
[SPEAKER_02]: And now that we had a little bit of history, the commission had to go back and readjust it a little bit to make it work.

1123
01:23:40,619 --> 01:23:47,502
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do have the $23.5 million to pay our share of the MWRA costs that the city has assessed.

1124
01:23:52,404 --> 01:23:57,206
[SPEAKER_15]: So on the main motion of approval by Councilor Camuso, as amended by Councilors Longo, Kern,

1125
01:23:59,412 --> 01:24:00,993
[SPEAKER_24]: Councillor Marks.

1126
01:24:01,073 --> 01:24:02,013
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1127
01:24:02,053 --> 01:24:12,116
[SPEAKER_24]: Just regarding the conservation that was brought up by one of the speakers, you know, it is interesting that the city's promoting conservation with the residents of this community.

1128
01:24:12,876 --> 01:24:17,618
[SPEAKER_24]: And when it comes to their own conservation, they don't know what they're paying for water and sewer.

1129
01:24:18,378 --> 01:24:20,019
[SPEAKER_24]: They have no idea because they don't pay a bill.

1130
01:24:20,879 --> 01:24:26,961
[SPEAKER_24]: And if you look at any of the faucets, I would ask you to go into any building, come into city hall,

1131
01:24:27,431 --> 01:24:32,192
[SPEAKER_24]: Go into any of the restrooms and see the old, outdated faucets they're using in there.

1132
01:24:33,032 --> 01:24:37,393
[SPEAKER_24]: There's no low-lying water heads in any of those faucets in there.

1133
01:24:37,773 --> 01:24:43,494
[SPEAKER_24]: So really, when it comes to conservation, the city should practice what they preach.

1134
01:24:44,154 --> 01:24:53,036
[SPEAKER_24]: And if they had a bill, and they looked at their bill and said, hey, from this year to this year, we used X number of gallons, and we need to conserve.

1135
01:24:53,456 --> 01:24:56,557
[SPEAKER_24]: But there's no statistics, because they're not getting a bill, Mr. President.

1136
01:24:57,378 --> 01:24:58,899
[SPEAKER_24]: Wouldn't that be great if you didn't get a bill?

1137
01:24:58,939 --> 01:25:00,841
[SPEAKER_24]: You wouldn't have to worry about conservation at all.

1138
01:25:01,381 --> 01:25:02,962
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's what the city's doing right now.

1139
01:25:03,383 --> 01:25:06,285
[SPEAKER_24]: The city's not concerned with conservation.

1140
01:25:06,886 --> 01:25:07,906
[SPEAKER_24]: Go into any of the facilities.

1141
01:25:07,926 --> 01:25:08,727
[SPEAKER_24]: Go into the library.

1142
01:25:08,987 --> 01:25:10,909
[SPEAKER_24]: You turn on the water, it comes out like a fire hose.

1143
01:25:11,806 --> 01:25:13,087
[SPEAKER_24]: There's no conservation there.

1144
01:25:13,627 --> 01:25:15,909
[SPEAKER_24]: Our faucets have two knobs, hot and cold.

1145
01:25:16,469 --> 01:25:18,511
[SPEAKER_24]: That went out 50 years ago, Mr. President.

1146
01:25:18,691 --> 01:25:21,273
[SPEAKER_24]: Consular, we're a step away from a watering hole.

1147
01:25:22,254 --> 01:25:22,974
[SPEAKER_24]: We really are.

1148
01:25:23,895 --> 01:25:33,282
[SPEAKER_24]: And not only, Mr. President, just to talk about the restrooms up here again, when you go in to use the hot and cold water, if you take your hand off the cold, it flips back.

1149
01:25:34,462 --> 01:25:39,991
[SPEAKER_24]: So to put hot and cold on at the same time, if you want lukewarm water, you have to have seven pairs of hands there.

1150
01:25:40,352 --> 01:25:45,941
[SPEAKER_24]: So you have to go ask someone else from City Hall if they could come and hold the cold while you got the hot going so you can wash your hands.

1151
01:25:46,858 --> 01:25:48,879
[SPEAKER_24]: This is how archaic it is, Mr. President.

1152
01:25:49,339 --> 01:25:57,402
[SPEAKER_24]: So, when it comes to conservation, you know, the City Hall, Mr. Mayor can preach all he wants about conservation and the great shape the city's in.

1153
01:25:57,642 --> 01:26:14,048
[SPEAKER_24]: If you want to see the great shape the city is in, take your family up and use the restroom in the public library and take them up here to City Hall and have them go, your son or daughter, go under the caution tape in the bathroom at City Hall here, and you'll be able to see firsthand what great shape the city's in, Mr. President.

1154
01:26:14,854 --> 01:26:15,234
[SPEAKER_15]: Very good.

1155
01:26:15,274 --> 01:26:27,757
[SPEAKER_15]: So on the motion approved by Councillor Camuso as amended by Councillors Marks and Lungo Kern and with the B paper or the amendment offered, the separate amendment offered by, is it a B paper?

1156
01:26:32,318 --> 01:26:35,719
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a separate amendment, which is contrary to the main motion.

1157
01:26:42,700 --> 01:26:44,401
[SPEAKER_15]: and as amended by Councilor Penta.

1158
01:26:45,341 --> 01:26:48,283
[SPEAKER_15]: So on that, it's the whole motion taken together.

1159
01:26:48,963 --> 01:26:50,464
[SPEAKER_15]: Or are we taking your amendment separately?

1160
01:26:51,905 --> 01:26:53,426
[SPEAKER_15]: His amendment is separate.

1161
01:26:53,466 --> 01:26:55,747
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Penta's amendment is separate.

1162
01:26:55,787 --> 01:26:59,629
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk, please call roll on the severed amendment.

1163
01:27:02,710 --> 01:27:04,912
[SPEAKER_15]: On the severed amendment of Councilor Penta.

1164
01:27:05,192 --> 01:27:06,632
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1165
01:27:07,273 --> 01:27:08,073
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Camuso?

1166
01:27:08,193 --> 01:27:08,393
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1167
01:27:08,954 --> 01:27:09,794
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Kerrio?

1168
01:27:09,814 --> 01:27:09,954
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1169
01:27:10,675 --> 01:27:11,215
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight?

1170
01:27:11,315 --> 01:27:11,475
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1171
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:15,121
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1172
01:27:17,122 --> 01:27:17,803
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1173
01:27:18,163 --> 01:27:18,403
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

1174
01:27:18,823 --> 01:27:21,345
[SPEAKER_15]: The vote of four in the negative three in the affirmative.

1175
01:27:21,865 --> 01:27:27,089
[SPEAKER_15]: The motion fails main paper by with a motion of approval by council.

1176
01:27:27,369 --> 01:27:32,533
[SPEAKER_15]: So as amended by counselors, Lungo Kern and marks as a clerk, please call the roll.

1177
01:27:33,113 --> 01:27:33,193
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1178
01:27:44,589 --> 01:27:48,111
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, with a vote of 5 in the affirmative and 2 in the negative, the motion passes.

1179
01:27:49,131 --> 01:27:49,992
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Camuso.

1180
01:27:52,133 --> 01:27:53,493
[SPEAKER_15]: It's all set.

1181
01:28:02,858 --> 01:28:03,278
[SPEAKER_15]: Very good.

1182
01:28:03,418 --> 01:28:06,059
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of Councilor Camuso to take the papers from the table.

1183
01:28:06,099 --> 01:28:06,799
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

1184
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:08,260
[SPEAKER_15]: Those opposed?

1185
01:28:08,900 --> 01:28:09,721
[SPEAKER_15]: We've received the

1186
01:28:10,852 --> 01:28:24,364
[SPEAKER_15]: Afford mentioned a paper of communication and explanation as a requested by the council previously, and as further required by the council by vote of emotion of vice-president on go current.

1187
01:28:25,225 --> 01:28:31,431
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, so before us is 15 dash seven 34 loan order for the DPW facility project funds, $300,000.

1188
01:28:31,471 --> 01:28:37,196
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, the chair recognizes a councilor Camuso for motion of approval.

1189
01:28:37,738 --> 01:28:37,918
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

1190
01:28:37,938 --> 01:28:40,620
[SPEAKER_15]: Miller, if any of the councilors have any questions for you.

1191
01:28:51,389 --> 01:29:03,079
[SPEAKER_15]: There is a written, uh, we didn't have any questions last week.

1192
01:29:03,159 --> 01:29:04,300
[SPEAKER_15]: It was on the table last week.

1193
01:29:05,241 --> 01:29:06,482
[SPEAKER_22]: I did not receive any.

1194
01:29:07,157 --> 01:29:07,857
[SPEAKER_22]: questions.

1195
01:29:10,218 --> 01:29:13,419
[SPEAKER_22]: I responded to the questions that you asked me here last time I was here.

1196
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:24,584
[SPEAKER_24]: So we asked the question of the city solicitor regarding the DPW yard, whether or not we were going to go after, uh, the particular consultant company, uh, for the cost.

1197
01:29:27,605 --> 01:29:31,106
[SPEAKER_24]: It does not say that that is not for that.

1198
01:29:31,186 --> 01:29:32,187
[SPEAKER_24]: There's two different papers.

1199
01:29:33,367 --> 01:29:35,408
[SPEAKER_24]: So for that paper, mr. President, we asked,

1200
01:29:35,923 --> 01:29:38,724
[SPEAKER_24]: We did not get a response back from the city solicitor.

1201
01:29:40,044 --> 01:29:42,385
[SPEAKER_24]: And that was one of the reasons why it was tabled.

1202
01:29:45,346 --> 01:29:46,647
[SPEAKER_24]: That was only the one I could fit.

1203
01:29:46,687 --> 01:29:48,347
[SPEAKER_24]: I know there was several questions asked.

1204
01:29:49,528 --> 01:29:49,708
[SPEAKER_24]: Ms.

1205
01:29:49,748 --> 01:29:56,590
[SPEAKER_22]: Miller, do you want to, um, yeah, if I may, Mr. President, um, I did speak with the city solicitor.

1206
01:29:56,610 --> 01:29:58,050
[SPEAKER_22]: I do recall that you asked that question.

1207
01:29:58,070 --> 01:30:00,071
[SPEAKER_22]: I did speak with the city's solicitor.

1208
01:30:00,431 --> 01:30:04,993
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, and what he said was we would certainly look at what our avenues were.

1209
01:30:05,193 --> 01:30:05,693
[SPEAKER_22]: However,

1210
01:30:06,335 --> 01:30:11,796
[SPEAKER_22]: because there was no breach of contract on the part of the consultant here.

1211
01:30:12,336 --> 01:30:18,698
[SPEAKER_22]: So we likely would not be recovering anything even if we tried to pursue some type of litigation.

1212
01:30:18,738 --> 01:30:21,458
[SPEAKER_22]: This was an estimate on a project.

1213
01:30:22,878 --> 01:30:25,679
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's where we were at.

1214
01:30:25,959 --> 01:30:26,479
[SPEAKER_24]: Right.

1215
01:30:26,539 --> 01:30:35,941
[SPEAKER_24]: So we hire, and I'm not putting this at you, but we hire an outside consultant to come in and give us an estimate.

1216
01:30:36,342 --> 01:30:38,484
[SPEAKER_24]: on the cost of cleanup of the DPW yard.

1217
01:30:39,084 --> 01:30:42,706
[SPEAKER_24]: They were roughly 100% off of what they quoted us.

1218
01:30:43,807 --> 01:30:45,148
[SPEAKER_24]: And we have no recourse.

1219
01:30:46,529 --> 01:30:47,970
[SPEAKER_24]: Why are we hiring these companies?

1220
01:30:48,350 --> 01:30:49,651
[SPEAKER_24]: Why are we paying these companies?

1221
01:30:50,452 --> 01:30:55,595
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, you could have got Joe off the street to give you an estimate, and he probably would have been closer.

1222
01:30:56,796 --> 01:31:00,699
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, I'm not sure why there's no recourse on this.

1223
01:31:01,299 --> 01:31:02,240
[SPEAKER_24]: It doesn't make any sense.

1224
01:31:02,820 --> 01:31:05,082
[SPEAKER_22]: We would have to establish professional negligence.

1225
01:31:06,390 --> 01:31:09,251
[SPEAKER_22]: That's what the standard would be in this particular instance.

1226
01:31:09,271 --> 01:31:11,752
[SPEAKER_24]: So what is the current standard now?

1227
01:31:12,472 --> 01:31:23,717
[SPEAKER_24]: If you hire a company, because I know we've hired companies in the past, and I've heard of a margin of 10 to 15 percent is an acceptable margin of error, and 100 percent to me is not acceptable.

1228
01:31:24,317 --> 01:31:31,360
[SPEAKER_24]: There has to be a current standard of practice that's used, and there has to be one that exists.

1229
01:31:31,679 --> 01:31:33,100
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm not sure if you can answer that or not.

1230
01:31:33,540 --> 01:31:37,941
[SPEAKER_22]: I can't answer that today, but I, I did speak with the city solicitor regarding this.

1231
01:31:38,241 --> 01:31:42,703
[SPEAKER_22]: And so to the extent that there are avenues that we can pursue, we certainly will.

1232
01:31:43,503 --> 01:31:46,945
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, it just was, we're not confident.

1233
01:31:48,145 --> 01:31:51,426
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't think anything's going to be followed up on unless I see something in writing.

1234
01:31:52,027 --> 01:31:55,428
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't think anything in this to be quite honest with you is going to be followed up on.

1235
01:31:56,288 --> 01:31:58,509
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, so I, I can't support this.

1236
01:31:59,169 --> 01:32:01,170
[SPEAKER_24]: I cannot support this DPW paper.

1237
01:32:01,605 --> 01:32:10,071
[SPEAKER_24]: based on the fact that this company was $475,000 off of an estimate that they gave.

1238
01:32:10,672 --> 01:32:13,374
[SPEAKER_24]: They said it was gonna be about 500,000 to clean up this site.

1239
01:32:13,974 --> 01:32:25,623
[SPEAKER_24]: And then it goes on, the response we get back, and this response to me, if you read it, it says the city environmental consultant had tested the property to determine the extent of the contamination.

1240
01:32:26,303 --> 01:32:26,924
[SPEAKER_24]: So that's great.

1241
01:32:26,984 --> 01:32:31,287
[SPEAKER_24]: They went in there, did their boring, and tested the soil to let us know what's under there.

1242
01:32:32,317 --> 01:32:41,981
[SPEAKER_24]: Now I know because of the cleanup that took place on Riverside Ave with the site of where the noodles and Panera is that there was a lot of issues with the contamination.

1243
01:32:42,421 --> 01:32:47,923
[SPEAKER_24]: Once it was dug up, there was different ways that they had to handle the contamination.

1244
01:32:48,544 --> 01:32:52,105
[SPEAKER_24]: So the reason why you do the boring is to find out what's under there.

1245
01:32:52,485 --> 01:32:53,706
[SPEAKER_24]: So it's not a surprise.

1246
01:32:54,206 --> 01:33:01,449
[SPEAKER_24]: So you know what has to go out to landfill or what has to be recycled or what could be disposed of in an unlined area.

1247
01:33:02,048 --> 01:33:02,709
[SPEAKER_24]: of landfill.

1248
01:33:03,309 --> 01:33:05,591
[SPEAKER_24]: So that's the reason why you do this testing.

1249
01:33:06,511 --> 01:33:17,279
[SPEAKER_24]: And then it goes on to say, depending on the test results of the soil, we were able to reuse, dispose at an unlined landfill, dispose at a lined landfill, or recycled off-site.

1250
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:25,045
[SPEAKER_24]: The exact amount of the soil in each category and the cost could not be fully determined until the testing of each pile of evacuated soil.

1251
01:33:26,306 --> 01:33:27,467
[SPEAKER_24]: That's why we do the boring.

1252
01:33:28,908 --> 01:33:29,729
[SPEAKER_24]: That's why we dig.

1253
01:33:30,837 --> 01:33:32,719
[SPEAKER_24]: That's why we dig to find out what's out there.

1254
01:33:32,739 --> 01:33:34,541
[SPEAKER_24]: So we know what's under the ground.

1255
01:33:35,583 --> 01:33:36,804
[SPEAKER_24]: And you're not going to get it exact.

1256
01:33:36,844 --> 01:33:37,625
[SPEAKER_24]: I understand that.

1257
01:33:38,526 --> 01:33:40,789
[SPEAKER_24]: But we should know the contaminants that are underground.

1258
01:33:41,189 --> 01:33:50,561
[SPEAKER_24]: Based on the footage that's in that lot, we should be able to tell roughly what it costs to handle this particular landfill.

1259
01:33:51,967 --> 01:33:53,648
[SPEAKER_24]: So I don't buy that.

1260
01:33:53,728 --> 01:34:05,136
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't buy the fact that the city now is saying that, well, until we actually get the soil on the ground and see what it is, then we can really have a great picture of what we have to deal with.

1261
01:34:06,137 --> 01:34:07,918
[SPEAKER_24]: That's why we did the testing in the first place.

1262
01:34:10,680 --> 01:34:11,721
[SPEAKER_24]: Tell me if I'm wrong.

1263
01:34:11,921 --> 01:34:13,702
[SPEAKER_22]: No, no, I understand what you're saying.

1264
01:34:13,742 --> 01:34:20,147
[SPEAKER_22]: But so what happened with the soils, separate permits have to be obtained.

1265
01:34:20,847 --> 01:34:25,789
[SPEAKER_22]: for the disposal of, and they're in 500 ton piles.

1266
01:34:26,389 --> 01:34:35,073
[SPEAKER_22]: So each 500 ton pile had to be tested separately because that's the maximum amount that the DEP allows in one disposal load.

1267
01:34:35,433 --> 01:34:37,474
[SPEAKER_22]: And each one did test separately.

1268
01:34:37,554 --> 01:34:47,138
[SPEAKER_22]: And even after we finished removing the contaminated soil, as we dug further in phase two of the construction, we still continued to having to

1269
01:34:47,863 --> 01:34:52,606
[SPEAKER_22]: test every pile that we created that was over a certain amount.

1270
01:34:52,707 --> 01:34:55,068
[SPEAKER_24]: So, so what did we find that wasn't in the report?

1271
01:34:55,749 --> 01:35:08,698
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, we find out the double the cost that wasn't in the original report when, uh, this particular consultant came back, the city's environmental consultant came back and said, you know what method it's going to cost you a half a million dollars to clean this up.

1272
01:35:08,938 --> 01:35:10,299
[SPEAKER_24]: It has the smoking gun.

1273
01:35:10,840 --> 01:35:15,423
[SPEAKER_22]: It had to do with the site to which we, um, were able to take the soil.

1274
01:35:15,768 --> 01:35:17,929
[SPEAKER_22]: and the quantities that we needed it removed.

1275
01:35:19,029 --> 01:35:22,651
[SPEAKER_22]: So the site had a more expensive cost facility.

1276
01:35:23,211 --> 01:35:24,732
[SPEAKER_22]: The facility had more expensive costs.

1277
01:35:24,932 --> 01:35:25,512
[SPEAKER_22]: That is correct.

1278
01:35:25,552 --> 01:35:26,613
[SPEAKER_22]: It was more expensive.

1279
01:35:27,333 --> 01:35:28,794
[SPEAKER_22]: And the consultant wasn't aware of that.

1280
01:35:29,194 --> 01:35:29,874
[SPEAKER_22]: That is correct.

1281
01:35:30,894 --> 01:35:32,255
[SPEAKER_24]: And we have no recourse on that.

1282
01:35:33,075 --> 01:35:35,977
[SPEAKER_22]: That I have to leave to the city solicitor.

1283
01:35:36,017 --> 01:35:40,699
[SPEAKER_24]: But in my conversation with him, that's, that's where this is a half a million dollars of taxpayer money.

1284
01:35:41,539 --> 01:35:44,160
[SPEAKER_24]: Actually, you know, we want to loan, we want to borrow for it.

1285
01:35:44,493 --> 01:35:51,014
[SPEAKER_24]: So it mushrooms into 20 years of taxpayers' money, Mr. President.

1286
01:35:51,714 --> 01:35:53,175
[SPEAKER_24]: I can't support this, Mr. President.

1287
01:35:53,595 --> 01:35:59,856
[SPEAKER_24]: I want a detailed answer from the city solicitor on why this has doubled in cost, Mr. President.

1288
01:36:00,256 --> 01:36:01,616
[SPEAKER_24]: After hiring, we did our homework.

1289
01:36:01,836 --> 01:36:02,956
[SPEAKER_24]: We did our due diligence.

1290
01:36:03,296 --> 01:36:04,136
[SPEAKER_24]: We had the testing.

1291
01:36:04,377 --> 01:36:12,618
[SPEAKER_24]: We hired a firm, which I assume is a firm that adheres to all the standards of this particular site testing.

1292
01:36:13,400 --> 01:36:14,761
[SPEAKER_24]: And I don't know why we're so far off.

1293
01:36:16,061 --> 01:36:17,501
[SPEAKER_24]: Could you build an addition on your house?

1294
01:36:17,781 --> 01:36:23,983
[SPEAKER_24]: They come and say it's a hundred thousand then present you with a bill with 200,000 when you raise a flag and say, Hey, what's going on here?

1295
01:36:24,524 --> 01:36:25,344
[SPEAKER_24]: But no, we're a city.

1296
01:36:25,384 --> 01:36:25,964
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll just eat it.

1297
01:36:26,464 --> 01:36:26,904
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll just eat.

1298
01:36:26,944 --> 01:36:27,645
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not a big deal.

1299
01:36:28,745 --> 01:36:41,809
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm not saying that the city is going to end up eating the loss, but at this point we had contracts with contractors and the contractors who have done work and are finishing up work have to be paid.

1300
01:36:42,185 --> 01:36:45,307
[SPEAKER_22]: that's where we are with this particular loan order.

1301
01:36:45,788 --> 01:36:55,835
[SPEAKER_22]: So whether we have recourse against the engineering firm is or consulting firm is one thing, but this is really to pay the contractors.

1302
01:36:56,655 --> 01:36:58,216
[SPEAKER_24]: Right.

1303
01:36:58,296 --> 01:37:00,778
[SPEAKER_24]: I understand that, but I'm not supporting it tonight.

1304
01:37:00,998 --> 01:37:06,982
[SPEAKER_15]: Would it be helpful if we had a committee of the whole meeting on this paper with the, uh, uh, Ms.

1305
01:37:07,022 --> 01:37:10,685
[SPEAKER_15]: Miller and the city solicitor, uh, to discuss the matter?

1306
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:12,681
[SPEAKER_24]: It's up to the council.

1307
01:37:12,961 --> 01:37:21,166
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm not supporting it tonight, but it's up to the council chair recognizes councilor Penta Louise, you, um, not you, excuse me.

1308
01:37:21,906 --> 01:37:29,410
[SPEAKER_23]: On November 4th, we received a letter from a solicitor Romley relating to this $300,000 request.

1309
01:37:30,251 --> 01:37:36,875
[SPEAKER_23]: And he indicated that the payment is for all costs incidental and related to, well, whatever incidental and related to is, I don't know.

1310
01:37:37,355 --> 01:37:38,776
[SPEAKER_23]: And then he indicates,

1311
01:37:39,280 --> 01:37:45,806
[SPEAKER_23]: that it's including payments for all costs as it relates to the construction of this particular building.

1312
01:37:46,947 --> 01:37:48,388
[SPEAKER_23]: Now, that was on November 4th.

1313
01:37:49,209 --> 01:37:56,595
[SPEAKER_23]: You give us a paper on November 25th, but prior to November 25th, which was last week, I believe some of the questions were as follows.

1314
01:37:56,795 --> 01:38:03,321
[SPEAKER_23]: Water leaks into the building, the air conditioning and the heating system were at awry, and there were problems ongoing over there.

1315
01:38:03,341 --> 01:38:05,343
[SPEAKER_23]: Now you would just say that here tonight,

1316
01:38:05,750 --> 01:38:09,393
[SPEAKER_23]: that this payment is for the contractor because of the job that he did.

1317
01:38:10,854 --> 01:38:16,319
[SPEAKER_23]: Why would you be paying the contractor if you still have leaks in the building, you have an AC and a heating system still not operable?

1318
01:38:16,779 --> 01:38:18,201
[SPEAKER_23]: The building's not even a year old.

1319
01:38:19,702 --> 01:38:28,069
[SPEAKER_23]: Isn't it customary that there's always a holdback of X amount of dollars in construction contracts or projects until at least the warranty period is up?

1320
01:38:29,250 --> 01:38:31,512
[SPEAKER_22]: The holdback is actually until

1321
01:38:32,821 --> 01:38:36,626
[SPEAKER_22]: final completion of the project, which hasn't occurred, and we have held back funds right now.

1322
01:38:36,926 --> 01:38:42,152
[SPEAKER_22]: We have not paid the contractor, which is why we're not having a problem right now.

1323
01:38:42,252 --> 01:38:51,383
[SPEAKER_22]: However, if we don't get the money, we will not be able to pay the contractor, at which point we'll be in breach of contract with the contractor.

1324
01:38:51,403 --> 01:38:52,745
[SPEAKER_23]: How much are you holding back right now?

1325
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:54,380
[SPEAKER_22]: Approximately $300,000.

1326
01:38:54,460 --> 01:38:56,602
[SPEAKER_23]: You're holding back, and you want another $300,000?

1327
01:38:56,922 --> 01:39:00,383
[SPEAKER_22]: No, that's the $300,000 we're holding back.

1328
01:39:00,423 --> 01:39:01,484
[SPEAKER_23]: So you're not holding it back.

1329
01:39:01,984 --> 01:39:03,465
[SPEAKER_23]: It's nowhere else in reserve out there.

1330
01:39:04,125 --> 01:39:05,226
[SPEAKER_22]: That is correct.

1331
01:39:05,366 --> 01:39:05,566
[SPEAKER_23]: OK.

1332
01:39:05,646 --> 01:39:13,810
[SPEAKER_23]: So therefore, we would like to believe that this $14,800,000 building was supposedly paid for, however it was paid for.

1333
01:39:15,571 --> 01:39:18,452
[SPEAKER_23]: Now we're being told that there is an environmental aspect to it.

1334
01:39:19,513 --> 01:39:22,054
[SPEAKER_23]: So the environmental aspect here that you're asking

1335
01:39:22,512 --> 01:39:28,536
[SPEAKER_23]: The cost of the project for part, if not all of this money, seems to be contrary to the building paying the contract.

1336
01:39:28,836 --> 01:39:31,238
[SPEAKER_23]: What does the contract have to do with the environmental part of it?

1337
01:39:31,798 --> 01:39:33,560
[SPEAKER_22]: We had a total budget for the project.

1338
01:39:34,520 --> 01:39:36,722
[SPEAKER_22]: And there were various funding sources for the budget.

1339
01:39:37,542 --> 01:39:43,827
[SPEAKER_22]: We need additional funds primarily because there were cost overruns.

1340
01:39:44,107 --> 01:39:48,990
[SPEAKER_22]: And what I did is I described for the council where the cost overruns came in.

1341
01:39:51,896 --> 01:40:09,140
[SPEAKER_22]: saved money from what our original projected budget was for the building, which is why I'm only here asking for $300,000 rather than almost the $500,000 that was the total cost over on the soil remediation.

1342
01:40:09,740 --> 01:40:15,481
[SPEAKER_22]: We waited to see whether we would recoup some of the losses as part of the building project, which we did.

1343
01:40:15,541 --> 01:40:19,782
[SPEAKER_22]: We recouped $200,000 worth of the losses during the building project.

1344
01:40:21,858 --> 01:40:24,479
[SPEAKER_23]: police on November 4th, the letter came forward.

1345
01:40:24,519 --> 01:40:29,801
[SPEAKER_23]: It did not mention anything about heat, air conditioning, soil, environmental, nothing.

1346
01:40:29,841 --> 01:40:37,164
[SPEAKER_23]: It just says for, for incidentals relative there to very generic and it makes no sense.

1347
01:40:37,204 --> 01:40:44,027
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm even surprised that the city solicitor would even write a letter like that without being more descriptive as it relates to why we're looking for the money.

1348
01:40:44,687 --> 01:40:46,668
[SPEAKER_23]: But last week I think you heard what the concerns were.

1349
01:40:47,140 --> 01:40:50,002
[SPEAKER_23]: you know, what, what, what, what some of these things are.

1350
01:40:50,082 --> 01:40:53,385
[SPEAKER_23]: And I, I just cannot believe this was Caldwell and Banker, Caldwell and Brown.

1351
01:40:53,405 --> 01:40:54,486
[SPEAKER_23]: This is Brown and Caldwell.

1352
01:40:54,826 --> 01:41:02,312
[SPEAKER_23]: And this is the same people that are in the West Medford area doing the city's parking lot over there, making an estimate of, of what should be done there.

1353
01:41:03,072 --> 01:41:03,893
[SPEAKER_22]: Same group of people?

1354
01:41:04,393 --> 01:41:05,114
[SPEAKER_22]: That is correct.

1355
01:41:05,174 --> 01:41:13,020
[SPEAKER_22]: But in West Medford, we actually hired a second consulting firm to do a review of the proposed cleanup and the cost estimate.

1356
01:41:13,480 --> 01:41:14,961
[SPEAKER_22]: So we did get that second opinion.

1357
01:41:15,021 --> 01:41:15,782
[SPEAKER_23]: And that second firm,

1358
01:41:17,430 --> 01:41:18,411
[SPEAKER_22]: It costs $5,000.

1359
01:41:18,931 --> 01:41:20,453
[SPEAKER_23]: That's correct.

1360
01:41:20,593 --> 01:41:23,115
[SPEAKER_23]: And the $5,000 company reviewed the $100,000 company.

1361
01:41:23,336 --> 01:41:23,976
[SPEAKER_22]: That is correct.

1362
01:41:23,996 --> 01:41:24,157
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah.

1363
01:41:24,337 --> 01:41:26,599
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, that makes a lot of sense, but that's beside the point.

1364
01:41:27,640 --> 01:41:28,841
[SPEAKER_23]: I am not going to support this.

1365
01:41:28,881 --> 01:41:29,882
[SPEAKER_23]: This does not make any sense.

1366
01:41:30,283 --> 01:41:33,926
[SPEAKER_23]: There is no reason in here as to why we should even be going forward with this.

1367
01:41:34,387 --> 01:41:37,350
[SPEAKER_23]: And if, in fact, they ran into a problem because they couldn't figure out

1368
01:41:38,530 --> 01:41:41,932
[SPEAKER_23]: In the landfill, I mean, how deep did they go?

1369
01:41:41,952 --> 01:41:43,292
[SPEAKER_23]: Is it their requirement?

1370
01:41:43,573 --> 01:41:44,233
[SPEAKER_23]: How deep did they go?

1371
01:41:44,273 --> 01:41:44,793
[SPEAKER_23]: Do you know?

1372
01:41:44,973 --> 01:41:48,495
[SPEAKER_22]: We asked that the entire site be cleaned up so that it could be closed.

1373
01:41:48,815 --> 01:41:51,917
[SPEAKER_22]: They went as deep as they had to to remove all the contamination.

1374
01:41:51,937 --> 01:41:53,558
[SPEAKER_23]: So if they went as deep as they had to go?

1375
01:41:53,838 --> 01:41:56,019
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, to clean up the entire contamination.

1376
01:41:56,039 --> 01:41:59,061
[SPEAKER_23]: And why is all this coming up now as a cost factor?

1377
01:42:01,262 --> 01:42:07,365
[SPEAKER_22]: Because we had a total project budget, and we were waiting to see what

1378
01:42:08,163 --> 01:42:12,205
[SPEAKER_22]: cost over one would be at the end of the project, which is where we are now.

1379
01:42:12,605 --> 01:42:14,346
[SPEAKER_23]: The actual cost you said is $975,000.

1380
01:42:14,966 --> 01:42:17,087
[SPEAKER_22]: That was the actual cost of the soil remediation.

1381
01:42:17,868 --> 01:42:19,188
[SPEAKER_23]: But now it's going to be another $300,000 over there.

1382
01:42:19,228 --> 01:42:21,509
[SPEAKER_23]: No, the $300,000 for the entire project.

1383
01:42:21,530 --> 01:42:25,371
[SPEAKER_22]: It's for the entire $14.5 million or whatever the total project cost was.

1384
01:42:25,391 --> 01:42:25,491
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

1385
01:42:25,511 --> 01:42:25,631
[SPEAKER_22]: It was $500,000.

1386
01:42:33,132 --> 01:42:35,393
[SPEAKER_22]: The cleanup had been budgeted originally at $500,000.

1387
01:42:35,593 --> 01:42:36,234
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1388
01:42:36,374 --> 01:42:39,196
[SPEAKER_15]: Point of information, Councilor Camuso.

1389
01:42:39,396 --> 01:42:41,437
[SPEAKER_07]: There's obviously some questions.

1390
01:42:42,037 --> 01:42:45,459
[SPEAKER_07]: Why don't we send this to the committee of the whole where we can have the department heads there?

1391
01:42:46,520 --> 01:42:49,082
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause it's, I just, there's some questions.

1392
01:42:49,122 --> 01:42:50,062
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would make that motion.

1393
01:42:50,082 --> 01:42:52,043
[SPEAKER_07]: I would draw a motion for approval.

1394
01:42:52,504 --> 01:42:54,365
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to send it to the committee of the whole.

1395
01:42:54,385 --> 01:42:58,447
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Lococo.

1396
01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:02,961
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, President De La Russo.

1397
01:43:03,041 --> 01:43:04,782
[SPEAKER_17]: I agree to Senate's Committee of the Whole.

1398
01:43:05,122 --> 01:43:10,345
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe we can get some documentation with regards to the bill from the contractor and how it's broken down.

1399
01:43:11,005 --> 01:43:15,528
[SPEAKER_17]: We did get correspondence, but maybe it can be just a little bit more detailed.

1400
01:43:16,528 --> 01:43:21,371
[SPEAKER_17]: Also, if we could just suggest that the free cash be looked into.

1401
01:43:21,391 --> 01:43:26,273
[SPEAKER_17]: We were told tonight that there is $9,623,000 in free cash, so I'm not sure why we're going out to bond for the $300,000 when we have

1402
01:43:31,630 --> 01:43:34,972
[SPEAKER_17]: obviously overtax the taxpayers enough.

1403
01:43:35,452 --> 01:43:40,795
[SPEAKER_17]: So if we can get that question answered or looked into before our Committee of the Whole meeting, that would be helpful.

1404
01:43:41,356 --> 01:43:42,496
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's just on this paper?

1405
01:43:43,217 --> 01:43:44,217
[SPEAKER_15]: On this paper.

1406
01:43:44,237 --> 01:43:44,217
$300,000.

1407
01:43:44,337 --> 01:43:52,582
[SPEAKER_15]: So on the motion to send this to Committee of the Whole by Councilor Camuso as seconded by Councilor Caviello, and we'll get those questions asked.

1408
01:43:52,942 --> 01:43:57,825
[SPEAKER_23]: Can we get the questions regarding the leaks in the building and the air conditioning and the heating and everything else?

1409
01:43:58,125 --> 01:43:59,546
[SPEAKER_23]: There must be a punch list of things to do.

1410
01:44:00,986 --> 01:44:05,847
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, and I do believe that those papers were forwarded to various department heads.

1411
01:44:06,187 --> 01:44:08,927
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a person in the DPW who's in charge of those issues?

1412
01:44:09,508 --> 01:44:10,248
[SPEAKER_22]: The commissioner.

1413
01:44:10,508 --> 01:44:11,008
[SPEAKER_15]: The commissioner.

1414
01:44:11,268 --> 01:44:11,608
[SPEAKER_15]: Very good.

1415
01:44:11,808 --> 01:44:14,348
[SPEAKER_15]: So we'll ask, request his presence.

1416
01:44:14,388 --> 01:44:16,349
[SPEAKER_15]: I have one question for Louisa.

1417
01:44:16,589 --> 01:44:17,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Caffiello.

1418
01:44:17,629 --> 01:44:26,130
[SPEAKER_02]: Louisa, also when we meet next week, I had asked about the warranty of the building, when it actually takes effect versus when they say it takes effect.

1419
01:44:26,350 --> 01:44:29,351
[SPEAKER_02]: I would think it shouldn't take effect until we actually

1420
01:44:30,242 --> 01:44:31,243
[SPEAKER_02]: complete our punch list.

1421
01:44:32,264 --> 01:44:35,807
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll find out when it takes effect.

1422
01:44:35,827 --> 01:44:38,329
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion, all those in favor?

1423
01:44:38,709 --> 01:44:38,949
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

1424
01:44:39,310 --> 01:44:40,691
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

1425
01:44:40,771 --> 01:44:43,013
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a citizen that wanted to speak.

1426
01:44:43,113 --> 01:44:47,757
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have a committee of the whole.

1427
01:44:47,777 --> 01:44:50,919
[SPEAKER_01]: Jean Martington, Cumming Street, Medford.

1428
01:44:50,959 --> 01:44:54,382
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, I want to thank Mr. Marks for asking those very good questions.

1429
01:44:55,183 --> 01:44:56,224
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's two issues here.

1430
01:44:56,284 --> 01:44:57,545
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all is the quality of work.

1431
01:44:58,459 --> 01:45:09,750
[SPEAKER_01]: which is in question, but then the second question, no offense to the person, the budget director, but the reason why they're coming to you is because they want another bond.

1432
01:45:10,250 --> 01:45:11,832
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are two separate issues here.

1433
01:45:11,872 --> 01:45:17,537
[SPEAKER_01]: First, you have the quality of work and that whole idea, and then you have the bonding question.

1434
01:45:18,258 --> 01:45:22,482
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's great that you're holding out on the money until they do what they said they were going to do.

1435
01:45:22,522 --> 01:45:23,803
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus, can I say something?

1436
01:45:24,740 --> 01:45:26,101
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the DPW yards.

1437
01:45:26,161 --> 01:45:28,864
[SPEAKER_01]: To not expect toxins is like a duh.

1438
01:45:29,024 --> 01:45:29,524
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?

1439
01:45:30,025 --> 01:45:31,866
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, DPW yard ground.

1440
01:45:32,627 --> 01:45:37,311
[SPEAKER_01]: The contractor should have known that there would have been toxins in that ground and deep.

1441
01:45:37,971 --> 01:45:45,738
[SPEAKER_01]: So shame on us or shame, you know, for not thinking that through because we're letting the contractor get away with that one.

1442
01:45:46,118 --> 01:45:46,659
[SPEAKER_01]: That's on us.

1443
01:45:46,699 --> 01:45:47,219
[SPEAKER_01]: That's number one.

1444
01:45:47,640 --> 01:45:52,744
[SPEAKER_01]: But number two, the bonding question, no offense, but there's a hidden agenda to keep the bonding rate low.

1445
01:45:53,238 --> 01:45:56,942
[SPEAKER_01]: to keep a certain amount of money in the free cash.

1446
01:45:57,882 --> 01:46:04,949
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's be honest about that, what's going on behind that scene, which is that they want a lower bonding rate, which is great for borrowing money.

1447
01:46:05,310 --> 01:46:07,792
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're putting us in more debt when we have free cash.

1448
01:46:08,212 --> 01:46:13,758
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus, this can go under the water and sewer enterprise account because it's the DPW yard.

1449
01:46:14,098 --> 01:46:14,258
[SPEAKER_01]: So, no?

1450
01:46:16,836 --> 01:46:18,798
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I apologize for that, then I'm wrong.

1451
01:46:18,898 --> 01:46:19,538
[SPEAKER_01]: I stand corrected.

1452
01:46:19,999 --> 01:46:29,807
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, you can use the free cash money, but again, there is a hidden agenda that we shouldn't keep this money if we need it for this purpose.

1453
01:46:30,667 --> 01:46:35,331
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, we should have a little cushion in case there's a rainy day, but it's like $9 million, okay?

1454
01:46:36,672 --> 01:46:42,757
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can use the $300,000 for this, because we need a police station, and that's going to also have toxins under it.

1455
01:46:43,037 --> 01:46:43,898
[SPEAKER_01]: But thank you very much.

1456
01:46:44,298 --> 01:46:44,678
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1457
01:46:44,759 --> 01:46:46,380
[SPEAKER_15]: So this paper has been disposed of.

1458
01:46:47,505 --> 01:46:48,866
[SPEAKER_15]: This paper has been disposed of.

1459
01:46:48,906 --> 01:46:50,127
[SPEAKER_15]: It's no longer under discussion.

1460
01:46:55,811 --> 01:46:56,692
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a quick point of view.

1461
01:46:57,632 --> 01:46:57,953
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1462
01:46:58,113 --> 01:47:00,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Avenue, Effort Mass.

1463
01:47:01,275 --> 01:47:03,417
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd love to discuss this on public access TV.

1464
01:47:03,717 --> 01:47:13,704
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we need to have more transparency in the city because one night at a city council meeting is not enough to get the point across to all 58,000 people, 60,000 people in the city.

1465
01:47:14,205 --> 01:47:15,606
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's our public access TV?

1466
01:47:15,946 --> 01:47:17,067
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's all this money going?

1467
01:47:19,450 --> 01:47:26,173
[SPEAKER_15]: We have 15 736 before us, a loan order on the Whitthrop street drainage project for $350,000.

1468
01:47:26,233 --> 01:47:29,555
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Camuso.

1469
01:47:30,375 --> 01:47:35,418
[SPEAKER_07]: This one here, uh, the city is pursuing litigation for the money that they feel is owed to them.

1470
01:47:36,138 --> 01:47:39,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, we have to pay this and move approval at this point.

1471
01:47:39,440 --> 01:47:41,140
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion approved by Councilor Camuso.

1472
01:47:42,001 --> 01:47:42,161
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

1473
01:47:42,201 --> 01:47:46,483
[SPEAKER_15]: Miller, do you, uh, have anything in addition to, uh, present to us?

1474
01:47:47,436 --> 01:47:47,636
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

1475
01:47:47,736 --> 01:47:57,119
[SPEAKER_22]: In this instance, we are seeking, um, we are pursuing the, um, engineering firm and I have detailed what the $350,000 adds up to.

1476
01:47:57,159 --> 01:47:57,699
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1477
01:47:57,719 --> 01:48:01,540
[SPEAKER_15]: Chair recognizes the Vice President.

1478
01:48:01,981 --> 01:48:03,621
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, President De La Russa.

1479
01:48:03,641 --> 01:48:07,242
[SPEAKER_17]: I know we had discussed this last week and there was no, you know, no detail to it.

1480
01:48:07,322 --> 01:48:16,625
[SPEAKER_17]: So just to let the viewing public know that the cost overruns are attributed to design errors of the city's outside engineering firm.

1481
01:48:17,571 --> 01:48:19,832
[SPEAKER_17]: which the City intends to recoup through litigation.

1482
01:48:19,852 --> 01:48:28,233
[SPEAKER_17]: An unmarked duck-bang conflict resulted in $87,000 of additional cost, while unanticipated rock that had to be removed cost another $171,000.

1483
01:48:28,273 --> 01:48:41,076
[SPEAKER_17]: This additional work resulted in additional police details totaling $72,000 and additional time spent on the project by a contracted construction supervisor of $20,000.

1484
01:48:41,656 --> 01:48:44,917
[SPEAKER_17]: Same question on this one with regards to the

1485
01:48:45,597 --> 01:48:50,619
[SPEAKER_17]: the recouping, number one, using free cash, number two, recouping through litigation.

1486
01:48:51,800 --> 01:48:53,601
[SPEAKER_17]: You did mention that last week as well.

1487
01:48:53,981 --> 01:48:55,501
[SPEAKER_17]: What stage in litigation are we at?

1488
01:48:55,541 --> 01:48:56,642
[SPEAKER_17]: Have we filed suit?

1489
01:48:56,782 --> 01:48:58,583
[SPEAKER_17]: Are we trying to negotiate that first?

1490
01:48:58,983 --> 01:49:00,003
[SPEAKER_22]: We have not filed suit.

1491
01:49:00,023 --> 01:49:03,965
[SPEAKER_22]: What we did is we prepared our internal documents.

1492
01:49:04,365 --> 01:49:12,369
[SPEAKER_22]: We have put a file together and the city solicitor and I have discussed an outside firm that we would be hiring.

1493
01:49:20,109 --> 01:49:25,533
[SPEAKER_17]: And what do we put in towards the outside firm as far as litigation costs?

1494
01:49:26,373 --> 01:49:28,455
[SPEAKER_17]: We haven't assessed that yet.

1495
01:49:29,255 --> 01:49:31,857
[SPEAKER_17]: And are we going after the full 350 or?

1496
01:49:32,217 --> 01:49:32,718
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, we are.

1497
01:49:33,338 --> 01:49:35,720
[SPEAKER_17]: Anything additional to the 350 or that's it?

1498
01:49:37,781 --> 01:49:39,002
[SPEAKER_22]: I couldn't answer that question.

1499
01:49:39,062 --> 01:49:43,765
[SPEAKER_22]: If the city solicitor has something else in mind, yeah, he would have to answer that question.

1500
01:49:47,107 --> 01:49:47,527
[SPEAKER_17]: Roll call.

1501
01:49:47,568 --> 01:49:49,589
[SPEAKER_17]: I would just move that this be taken out of free cash.

1502
01:49:51,446 --> 01:49:52,046
[SPEAKER_07]: Contradictory.

1503
01:49:54,989 --> 01:49:58,892
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm amending it to read that the money be taken out of free cash.

1504
01:50:02,194 --> 01:50:03,816
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's two votes, the same as the other paper.

1505
01:50:04,576 --> 01:50:04,977
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion.

1506
01:50:05,457 --> 01:50:06,618
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a motion to sever that?

1507
01:50:07,198 --> 01:50:07,478
[SPEAKER_15]: Please.

1508
01:50:07,498 --> 01:50:11,702
[SPEAKER_15]: A motion to sever this as a B paper.

1509
01:50:13,023 --> 01:50:14,544
[SPEAKER_23]: Chair recognizes Councilor Penta.

1510
01:50:14,604 --> 01:50:18,467
[SPEAKER_23]: Mr. President, I, I, Louise, I'm somewhat confused here right now because

1511
01:50:19,064 --> 01:50:23,826
[SPEAKER_23]: You're asking for $350,000 to close out the project, but you're also suing the contractor.

1512
01:50:24,686 --> 01:50:25,766
[SPEAKER_22]: We're not suing the contractor.

1513
01:50:25,806 --> 01:50:26,987
[SPEAKER_22]: We're suing the engineering firm.

1514
01:50:28,507 --> 01:50:29,628
[SPEAKER_23]: You're suing the engineering firm?

1515
01:50:29,928 --> 01:50:30,128
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes.

1516
01:50:30,268 --> 01:50:39,631
[SPEAKER_23]: So you're paying $350,000 to the contractor because you're alleging, or they're alleging, that there was additional rock that had to be removed.

1517
01:50:40,392 --> 01:50:40,772
[SPEAKER_00]: That is correct.

1518
01:50:40,792 --> 01:50:41,052
[SPEAKER_23]: And it cost $171,000.

1519
01:50:41,092 --> 01:50:41,992
[SPEAKER_23]: And the duck bank thing and $72,000

1520
01:50:47,402 --> 01:50:47,962
[SPEAKER_23]: detail.

1521
01:50:47,982 --> 01:50:49,484
[SPEAKER_23]: Where was the city's person on this?

1522
01:50:49,524 --> 01:50:52,486
[SPEAKER_23]: Did the city from the engineer's office have a person on this job?

1523
01:50:53,206 --> 01:50:53,907
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, we did.

1524
01:50:54,947 --> 01:50:56,208
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, didn't they anticipate this?

1525
01:50:56,228 --> 01:51:01,652
[SPEAKER_23]: If when they first started up on Winthrop street and got to the rotary, it was all rock going up and it was all rock going forward.

1526
01:51:03,653 --> 01:51:04,574
[SPEAKER_22]: We did not.

1527
01:51:04,874 --> 01:51:15,922
[SPEAKER_22]: And, um, president council president, I'm not sure how far into what our claim I want to, um, or am able to go into an open session.

1528
01:51:16,805 --> 01:51:27,809
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, but the engineering firm did not do what the contract required it to do before putting the engineering contract out to bid.

1529
01:51:28,789 --> 01:51:31,070
[SPEAKER_22]: And that is what our claim is.

1530
01:51:31,810 --> 01:51:35,311
[SPEAKER_23]: You're saying the engineering firm did not do what the contractor said or vice versa?

1531
01:51:35,371 --> 01:51:40,313
[SPEAKER_22]: The contract with the engineering firm required them to do before putting out bidding documents.

1532
01:51:42,053 --> 01:51:43,934
[SPEAKER_22]: The engineering portion of the bidding documents.

1533
01:51:44,363 --> 01:51:44,823
[SPEAKER_22]: I do the contract.

1534
01:51:44,904 --> 01:51:48,487
[SPEAKER_23]: But while that's going on, but where was the city's person to say, what are you doing?

1535
01:51:48,507 --> 01:51:49,167
[SPEAKER_23]: You can't do this.

1536
01:51:49,828 --> 01:51:51,089
[SPEAKER_23]: You're not following the contract.

1537
01:51:52,870 --> 01:51:54,011
[SPEAKER_23]: Why did they go through all this?

1538
01:51:54,872 --> 01:51:59,136
[SPEAKER_23]: Almost $300,000, $350,000 before they realized that they didn't do what they were supposed to do.

1539
01:52:00,497 --> 01:52:01,418
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh no.

1540
01:52:01,478 --> 01:52:06,022
[SPEAKER_22]: We knew that there was an issue before the $350,000 was spent.

1541
01:52:06,042 --> 01:52:11,226
[SPEAKER_22]: But once the project was started, there was a hole in the street and the project had to be continued.

1542
01:52:12,032 --> 01:52:17,797
[SPEAKER_23]: But as the project was being continued, where was the update from the city or from the person from the city?

1543
01:52:18,217 --> 01:52:27,985
[SPEAKER_23]: This looks like it's all now after the fact, because once they got to the rotary there at Winthrop circle and they started to go forward on Winthrop street, further to the high school, that's when they hit all that ledge.

1544
01:52:28,345 --> 01:52:28,946
[SPEAKER_23]: That is correct.

1545
01:52:28,966 --> 01:52:30,067
[SPEAKER_23]: Continuously, continuously.

1546
01:52:30,427 --> 01:52:32,008
[SPEAKER_23]: And we never got any updates on that.

1547
01:52:32,308 --> 01:52:34,910
[SPEAKER_23]: And we never got any kind of notification as it related to that.

1548
01:52:35,431 --> 01:52:38,013
[SPEAKER_23]: Where was the city's person from the engineer's office?

1549
01:52:38,713 --> 01:52:40,455
[SPEAKER_23]: Cassandra never told us about this.

1550
01:52:41,460 --> 01:52:44,281
[SPEAKER_22]: I can't answer for communications to the council.

1551
01:52:44,321 --> 01:52:50,644
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm also, I do not know at what point communications are made regarding these various topics.

1552
01:52:51,505 --> 01:53:00,589
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, but I do know at this point is that the project has ended and the contractor has been submitted a final invoice.

1553
01:53:00,789 --> 01:53:04,210
[SPEAKER_22]: The contractor did all the work and we are pursuing the engineering firm.

1554
01:53:05,071 --> 01:53:10,133
[SPEAKER_23]: So even though the contractor did all the work, was there a budget for the contractor?

1555
01:53:10,689 --> 01:53:11,350
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, there was.

1556
01:53:11,430 --> 01:53:13,671
[SPEAKER_23]: Was there an overrun in the budget for the contractor?

1557
01:53:13,771 --> 01:53:14,972
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, there was of $350,000.

1558
01:53:15,293 --> 01:53:16,694
[SPEAKER_23]: Now that was his overrun.

1559
01:53:16,754 --> 01:53:18,195
[SPEAKER_23]: Was there a specific dollar amount?

1560
01:53:18,235 --> 01:53:22,418
[SPEAKER_23]: And once that dollar amount was met, it had to be renegotiated or was it an open end overrun?

1561
01:53:23,299 --> 01:53:32,386
[SPEAKER_22]: It did not have to be renegotiated because the bid was a bid for the project with the unit price for the work that would be done.

1562
01:53:32,466 --> 01:53:35,888
[SPEAKER_22]: So for instance, with police details, we normally put in a sum.

1563
01:53:37,270 --> 01:53:40,752
[SPEAKER_22]: $150,000 is our estimate for what police details will be.

1564
01:53:41,332 --> 01:53:49,136
[SPEAKER_22]: The contractor is then reimbursed as police detail costs are incurred for rock and ledge removal of rock and ledge.

1565
01:53:49,716 --> 01:53:55,819
[SPEAKER_22]: We have a certain quantity of rock and let's say it's $50 per ton that they remove.

1566
01:53:56,379 --> 01:54:04,223
[SPEAKER_22]: So if they, we estimate a quantity of 10 tons, it's $500 in this instance, they found a thousand tons.

1567
01:54:04,962 --> 01:54:07,563
[SPEAKER_22]: So the cost was astronomically higher.

1568
01:54:07,823 --> 01:54:10,163
[SPEAKER_22]: The duck bank simply was never marked.

1569
01:54:10,503 --> 01:54:14,184
[SPEAKER_22]: So when they dug, they found a duck bank.

1570
01:54:15,244 --> 01:54:17,204
[SPEAKER_23]: So this is the same contract that we were going to pay.

1571
01:54:17,704 --> 01:54:31,147
[SPEAKER_23]: If I remember correctly, it was Councilor Nighthill alluded to way back when that they were putting this stuff all over the sidewalks and in front of people's homes and their trucks were all over the place and the green pipes were all up and down the street, but no penalty.

1572
01:54:33,188 --> 01:54:44,098
[SPEAKER_23]: I just don't understand how you can have a contract that doesn't have a penalty clause in there over and beyond, or if this has to be unanticipated work, a dollar amount and a beginning and an end date.

1573
01:54:44,398 --> 01:54:45,659
[SPEAKER_22]: What if this was a million dollars?

1574
01:54:45,679 --> 01:54:46,419
[SPEAKER_22]: What are we going to do, pay it?

1575
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:48,942
[SPEAKER_22]: There was a dollar amount.

1576
01:54:49,242 --> 01:54:51,904
[SPEAKER_22]: That's how we know what the cost overrun amounts were.

1577
01:54:51,924 --> 01:54:51,964
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

1578
01:54:52,104 --> 01:54:54,366
[SPEAKER_23]: Was there a time date to go to the dollar amount?

1579
01:54:55,747 --> 01:54:56,408
[SPEAKER_22]: A time date?

1580
01:54:56,468 --> 01:54:56,608
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah.

1581
01:54:56,668 --> 01:54:58,790
[SPEAKER_23]: In other words, was it a month, two months, three months?

1582
01:54:58,810 --> 01:55:01,532
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, if you're hitting ledge, it's quite obvious you're going to stop your

1583
01:55:02,403 --> 01:55:06,925
[SPEAKER_22]: It slowed the progress way down, which is why we incurred additional costs.

1584
01:55:07,565 --> 01:55:11,186
[SPEAKER_22]: Police details, we had days and days of additional police detail.

1585
01:55:11,246 --> 01:55:12,046
[SPEAKER_22]: Point of information, Mr. President.

1586
01:55:12,767 --> 01:55:14,387
[SPEAKER_24]: Point of information, Councilor Marks.

1587
01:55:15,948 --> 01:55:19,709
[SPEAKER_24]: I believe what's missing here is the engineering firm was hired by the city.

1588
01:55:20,189 --> 01:55:21,049
[SPEAKER_24]: That's correct.

1589
01:55:21,090 --> 01:55:22,990
[SPEAKER_24]: They're not part of the construction company.

1590
01:55:23,770 --> 01:55:31,153
[SPEAKER_24]: So they're the ones that were in error when they arrived at where the ledge was and how much it was going to cost and digging and so forth.

1591
01:55:31,689 --> 01:55:41,372
[SPEAKER_24]: I believe that's why the city's pursuing litigation with the engineering company and needing to pay off the actual people that did the work because they're two, the two separate companies.

1592
01:55:42,393 --> 01:55:43,873
[SPEAKER_24]: So I think that's what we're missing.

1593
01:55:43,893 --> 01:55:47,774
[SPEAKER_24]: Now the two separate companies, the company that did the work, they're not in fault.

1594
01:55:49,015 --> 01:55:50,095
[SPEAKER_23]: Uh, I got no problem with that.

1595
01:55:50,115 --> 01:55:58,198
[SPEAKER_23]: I think we were asking for, as we did the last copy of the contract so we could see at them and the engineering contract, we asked for the solicitor to give us a copy of that so we could

1596
01:55:58,649 --> 01:56:01,231
[SPEAKER_23]: so we could review that, have a better understanding of it.

1597
01:56:01,931 --> 01:56:20,164
[SPEAKER_23]: I guess my part that I just don't understand, because I'm not an expert anywhere in this particular area, but all I know is if you run into a snafu in any type of a contract, what overruns, whatever it might be, I believe that there was a beginning and an ending date and there's a penalty and a reward clause if you go over or beyond or if you don't exceed it.

1598
01:56:20,905 --> 01:56:22,526
[SPEAKER_23]: And I don't hear that conversation being said.

1599
01:56:22,906 --> 01:56:25,048
[SPEAKER_23]: I agree with Councilor Longo to take it out of free cash.

1600
01:56:25,068 --> 01:56:27,970
[SPEAKER_23]: So I would support the amendment to take it out of free cash.

1601
01:56:29,875 --> 01:56:39,859
[SPEAKER_15]: The question has been moved on the motion for approval by Councilor Camuso and with the seventh paper that the paper be taken, the money be taken out of free cash.

1602
01:56:40,399 --> 01:56:47,622
[SPEAKER_15]: So we'll take the seventh paper first, a motion by Vice President Alongo Kern to take the money out of free cash.

1603
01:56:47,982 --> 01:56:49,583
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1604
01:56:50,403 --> 01:56:51,204
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Camuso?

1605
01:56:52,444 --> 01:56:52,684
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1606
01:56:53,685 --> 01:56:54,465
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Caviello?

1607
01:56:54,485 --> 01:56:54,665
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1608
01:56:55,545 --> 01:56:56,106
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight?

1609
01:56:56,186 --> 01:56:56,386
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1610
01:56:57,306 --> 01:56:58,166
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Alongo Kern?

1611
01:56:58,927 --> 01:56:59,107
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1612
01:57:00,518 --> 01:57:00,778
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1613
01:57:02,499 --> 01:57:02,759
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1614
01:57:04,840 --> 01:57:10,582
[SPEAKER_15]: No vote of four in the negative three in the affirmative.

1615
01:57:11,382 --> 01:57:16,604
[SPEAKER_15]: The motion fails to the main motion for approval by councilor Camuso.

1616
01:57:17,324 --> 01:57:20,086
[SPEAKER_15]: This is, this is for first reading.

1617
01:57:20,966 --> 01:57:26,768
[SPEAKER_15]: So, uh, for passage of this, a simple majority is necessary before the roll call is called.

1618
01:57:27,388 --> 01:57:30,950
[SPEAKER_15]: The Vice President of the City Council has been asked to be recognized.

1619
01:57:30,970 --> 01:57:32,111
[SPEAKER_15]: Madam Vice President.

1620
01:57:32,131 --> 01:57:33,171
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, President DelaRosa.

1621
01:57:33,191 --> 01:57:41,376
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to mark my reasoning for voting no, because I believe this should be taken out of free cash, rather than go out to bond on such an issue.

1622
01:57:43,497 --> 01:57:45,718
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion for approval, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1623
01:57:47,399 --> 01:57:49,200
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Camuso?

1624
01:57:49,480 --> 01:57:49,620
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1625
01:57:50,280 --> 01:57:51,041
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Cabrera?

1626
01:57:51,161 --> 01:57:51,241
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1627
01:57:51,961 --> 01:57:52,442
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Nunez?

1628
01:57:52,502 --> 01:57:52,722
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1629
01:57:53,502 --> 01:57:54,303
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Longstreet?

1630
01:57:54,503 --> 01:57:54,803
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

1631
01:57:55,243 --> 01:57:55,343
No.

1632
01:57:57,179 --> 01:57:57,459
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1633
01:57:58,519 --> 01:57:59,020
[SPEAKER_09]: Council Penta?

1634
01:57:59,060 --> 01:57:59,260
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1635
01:58:00,020 --> 01:58:00,640
[SPEAKER_09]: President DelaRusso?

1636
01:58:00,980 --> 01:58:01,240
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1637
01:58:01,420 --> 01:58:05,041
[SPEAKER_15]: With a vote of five in the affirmative, two in the negative, first reading passes.

1638
01:58:05,902 --> 01:58:06,022
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

1639
01:58:06,042 --> 01:58:07,082
[SPEAKER_15]: Miller, thank you very much.

1640
01:58:07,642 --> 01:58:08,022
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1641
01:58:14,604 --> 01:58:15,884
[SPEAKER_15]: Papers on to suspension.

1642
01:58:16,785 --> 01:58:18,885
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion for suspension of the rules by Council Penta.

1643
01:58:19,185 --> 01:58:19,946
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

1644
01:58:20,586 --> 01:58:21,266
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

1645
01:58:21,746 --> 01:58:22,506
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion carries.

1646
01:58:22,946 --> 01:58:24,987
[SPEAKER_15]: Papers on to suspension in the hand of the clerk.

1647
01:58:25,858 --> 01:58:35,381
[SPEAKER_15]: uh, offered by consulate Penta under suspension, be it resolved that an expression of sympathy be forwarded to the family of Mark Spector, who recently passed away.

1648
01:58:36,142 --> 01:58:45,405
[SPEAKER_15]: Mark was the owner of Medford Hillside hardware store for years and was in a neighborhood staple to many businesses and residents.

1649
01:58:48,426 --> 01:58:52,507
[SPEAKER_23]: Mr. President, if anyone knows anything about the,

1650
01:58:53,110 --> 01:58:57,112
[SPEAKER_23]: the Medford Hillside up there by Tufts University where Sacred Heart Church used to be.

1651
01:58:57,772 --> 01:59:01,474
[SPEAKER_23]: Mark Spector and their Medford Hillside hardware store was well known.

1652
01:59:02,115 --> 01:59:11,800
[SPEAKER_23]: He was a very good businessman, but he was also very kind and gentle to his neighbors in the community and to the church when the church was there and as well to Tufts University.

1653
01:59:12,280 --> 01:59:14,061
[SPEAKER_23]: So he's certainly going to be missed.

1654
01:59:14,861 --> 01:59:19,083
[SPEAKER_23]: It's the second icon up there of a business person.

1655
01:59:19,664 --> 01:59:21,985
[SPEAKER_23]: Last year, it was the lady who owned Tasty Gourmet.

1656
01:59:22,903 --> 01:59:24,824
[SPEAKER_23]: Um, and now it's Mark Spector.

1657
01:59:24,864 --> 01:59:31,428
[SPEAKER_23]: So hopefully, um, they're at peace and their family is somewhat comforted at this particular time.

1658
01:59:31,848 --> 01:59:32,188
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1659
01:59:32,268 --> 01:59:33,909
[SPEAKER_15]: Please join us in a moment of silence.

1660
01:59:49,477 --> 01:59:50,838
[SPEAKER_15]: Papers in the hand of the clerk first.

1661
01:59:51,622 --> 02:00:00,509
[SPEAKER_15]: Be it resolved, offered by Councilor Camuso, be it resolved that the surcharge for senior citizens exemption for telephone use be discussed.

1662
02:00:01,830 --> 02:00:02,910
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1663
02:00:03,591 --> 02:00:04,251
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

1664
02:00:04,832 --> 02:00:08,675
[SPEAKER_07]: This is just a friendly reminder for anyone over 65 years of age.

1665
02:00:09,575 --> 02:00:21,044
[SPEAKER_07]: In the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, we're the only state that has a law that exempts senior citizens from having to pay for a fee to use

1666
02:00:22,772 --> 02:00:28,817
[SPEAKER_07]: So, if senior citizens see a fee on their bill for 411 directory assistance calls, it's usually $2.49.

1667
02:00:28,877 --> 02:00:32,179
[SPEAKER_07]: If you see that, give a call to Comcast at 855-270-0379.

1668
02:00:32,299 --> 02:00:33,560
[SPEAKER_07]: Could you repeat that, please?

1669
02:00:33,580 --> 02:00:34,001
[SPEAKER_07]: 1-855-270-0379.

1670
02:00:34,021 --> 02:00:34,821
[SPEAKER_07]: And Verizon is 1-800-974-4111.

1671
02:00:50,873 --> 02:00:57,294
[SPEAKER_07]: 6-0-0-6, and you can get the forms, fill them out, and you can be exempted that fee.

1672
02:00:57,794 --> 02:01:09,556
[SPEAKER_07]: So I know it's not a lot of money, but $2.50 a month for an entire year, it's certainly something for a senior citizen that's on a fixed income, and just want to spread the word on it.

1673
02:01:09,857 --> 02:01:11,457
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to see more people take advantage of it.

1674
02:01:12,237 --> 02:01:12,777
[SPEAKER_15]: Absolutely.

1675
02:01:12,937 --> 02:01:13,237
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1676
02:01:13,277 --> 02:01:15,157
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion approved by Councillor Tommuzo.

1677
02:01:15,638 --> 02:01:16,478
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favour?

1678
02:01:17,098 --> 02:01:17,778
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

1679
02:01:21,555 --> 02:01:22,635
[SPEAKER_15]: Citizen would like to speak.

1680
02:01:23,195 --> 02:01:26,756
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Citizen, please state your name and address for the record.

1681
02:01:27,876 --> 02:01:28,936
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1682
02:01:29,216 --> 02:01:31,977
[SPEAKER_20]: Bob Capucci, 71 Evans Street in Medford.

1683
02:01:32,637 --> 02:01:41,158
[SPEAKER_20]: I just wanted to talk about the third annual Jingle Bell 5K Walk Run that we just had here in Medford on Saturday.

1684
02:01:41,679 --> 02:01:49,060
[SPEAKER_20]: First of all, I want to thank the city of Medford, Lonergan's Insurance, all the folks that work the tables at the registration.

1685
02:01:50,307 --> 02:02:03,896
[SPEAKER_20]: other places like Carol's Restaurant, like we were talking about earlier, who hosted the night before the Mustang Spirit Night with Medford's own Vanessa Salvucci, awesome vocal talent.

1686
02:02:04,436 --> 02:02:06,317
[SPEAKER_20]: Also had a breakfast there the next morning.

1687
02:02:07,038 --> 02:02:14,622
[SPEAKER_20]: And to the police and the city officials that helped keep safety on the streets.

1688
02:02:15,063 --> 02:02:18,625
[SPEAKER_20]: And that is actually the reason I wanted to speak tonight before this body.

1689
02:02:19,119 --> 02:02:27,402
[SPEAKER_20]: Uh, they closed down Potter Riverside Avenue, but the, the walk run goes behind the McGlynn and Andrew school.

1690
02:02:28,122 --> 02:02:30,543
[SPEAKER_20]: And that street wasn't shut down.

1691
02:02:31,143 --> 02:02:34,544
[SPEAKER_20]: And, and I was a walker, not a runner.

1692
02:02:35,164 --> 02:02:42,907
[SPEAKER_20]: And I was walking next to, uh, a couple of families, uh, uh, counselor elect, uh, John Falco.

1693
02:02:43,067 --> 02:02:47,408
[SPEAKER_20]: I saw in the crowd there that day, uh, because that street was open,

1694
02:02:48,250 --> 02:02:58,635
[SPEAKER_20]: There were people making audible complaints and frustration having to pull their five and seven-year-old kid out in front of moving traffic.

1695
02:02:59,755 --> 02:03:17,503
[SPEAKER_20]: Next year, if they can also close down that street as well, not that I'm saying that there was an incident or anything, but it would probably be in the city's best interest for a public safety issue to either alter the route or close down that street as well.

1696
02:03:17,885 --> 02:03:23,408
[SPEAKER_20]: I forget the name of the street, it's right behind the McGlynn and Andrew School, running alongside Hormel.

1697
02:03:24,429 --> 02:03:31,993
[SPEAKER_20]: And also, if I can, a quick shout out to the Medford High Mustangs, who made a valiant effort at Hormel Stadium.

1698
02:03:32,814 --> 02:03:39,617
[SPEAKER_20]: Going to miss number 31, especially, DiLorenzo, Anthony, great player.

1699
02:03:40,678 --> 02:03:44,500
[SPEAKER_20]: But thank you all for the Jingle Bell Walk Run.

1700
02:03:44,660 --> 02:03:45,541
[SPEAKER_20]: It was a great event.

1701
02:03:45,621 --> 02:03:47,502
[SPEAKER_20]: I hope more people will come out for it.

1702
02:03:47,838 --> 02:03:48,539
[SPEAKER_20]: next year as well.

1703
02:03:48,759 --> 02:03:49,960
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1704
02:03:50,280 --> 02:03:50,760
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1705
02:03:51,821 --> 02:03:53,422
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion, is this on this matter?

1706
02:03:54,123 --> 02:03:54,704
[SPEAKER_16]: No, it's not.

1707
02:03:54,844 --> 02:03:55,204
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1708
02:03:55,544 --> 02:03:59,627
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of Councilor Camuso, that the paper be received and placed on file.

1709
02:03:59,968 --> 02:04:00,728
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

1710
02:04:00,748 --> 02:04:02,209
[SPEAKER_15]: Opposed?

1711
02:04:02,890 --> 02:04:03,270
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1712
02:04:04,591 --> 02:04:06,213
[SPEAKER_15]: Offered by Councilor Knight.

1713
02:04:06,933 --> 02:04:08,254
[SPEAKER_15]: Offered by Councilor Knight.

1714
02:04:08,935 --> 02:04:16,601
[SPEAKER_15]: Be it resolved, the Memphis City Council congratulates Stephen South on his recent appointment to the position of Vice President

1715
02:04:17,130 --> 02:04:20,652
[SPEAKER_15]: with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local Number 25.

1716
02:04:22,673 --> 02:04:23,594
[SPEAKER_11]: Counselor Knife.

1717
02:04:23,614 --> 02:04:25,035
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1718
02:04:25,335 --> 02:04:27,216
[SPEAKER_11]: Steve Sealth is a Medford resident.

1719
02:04:27,276 --> 02:04:33,660
[SPEAKER_11]: He's a hardworking individual whose efforts were honored by President O'Brien, also another Medford resident here down at Local 25.

1720
02:04:34,220 --> 02:04:40,884
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'd like the council to extend the deep condolence, deep congratulations to Mr. Sealth and his family on his recent appointment.

1721
02:04:41,355 --> 02:04:44,656
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, a little bit of both.

1722
02:04:45,137 --> 02:04:47,618
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of congratulations by Councilor Knight.

1723
02:04:48,058 --> 02:04:49,058
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

1724
02:04:49,438 --> 02:04:57,001
[SPEAKER_14]: Seconded by Councilor... Thank you, Councilor Pinto.

1725
02:04:57,141 --> 02:05:00,423
[SPEAKER_23]: I would be absolutely remiss if I did not say a few words about this gentleman.

1726
02:05:01,383 --> 02:05:10,467
[SPEAKER_23]: First of all, this is the gentleman who came down to a Memphis Public Works building and made intentional lies about

1727
02:05:10,947 --> 02:05:14,128
[SPEAKER_23]: me, Robert Penta, as a candidate for mayor in this past election.

1728
02:05:14,848 --> 02:05:18,390
[SPEAKER_23]: He basically went down there and said things that were absolutely not true.

1729
02:05:18,950 --> 02:05:20,010
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely not true.

1730
02:05:20,030 --> 02:05:21,891
[SPEAKER_11]: He does, and it most certainly does.

1731
02:05:21,911 --> 02:05:26,532
[SPEAKER_23]: You're talking about, it most certainly is about your colleague.

1732
02:05:26,733 --> 02:05:34,075
[SPEAKER_23]: He didn't do anything good because if he did say anything good, he wouldn't mind his business and he wouldn't spew out lies about a candidate running for office.

1733
02:05:34,135 --> 02:05:34,735
[SPEAKER_15]: I am not.

1734
02:05:34,795 --> 02:05:38,937
[SPEAKER_23]: I am talking about somebody, talking about somebody who had no right saying what they did.

1735
02:05:39,957 --> 02:05:43,218
[SPEAKER_23]: I am not, Mr. President.

1736
02:05:43,418 --> 02:05:48,420
[SPEAKER_23]: Your city solicitor is well aware of this.

1737
02:05:48,500 --> 02:05:50,821
[SPEAKER_23]: He even wrote a commentary as he relates to it.

1738
02:05:51,362 --> 02:05:54,103
[SPEAKER_23]: You just can't go around talking about people and telling lies.

1739
02:05:54,183 --> 02:05:55,363
[SPEAKER_23]: And that's just what the gentleman did.

1740
02:05:55,763 --> 02:05:59,585
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, if he wants to come here and apologize, I'll accept his apology.

1741
02:06:00,725 --> 02:06:05,547
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of approval by Councilor Knight, a roll call vote has been requested.

1742
02:06:06,287 --> 02:06:07,808
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1743
02:06:10,065 --> 02:06:13,007
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to speak on this.

1744
02:06:13,067 --> 02:06:14,428
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1745
02:06:14,569 --> 02:06:17,831
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Camuso?

1746
02:06:18,371 --> 02:06:18,531
Yes.

1747
02:06:19,352 --> 02:06:19,993
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Cabrillo?

1748
02:06:20,033 --> 02:06:20,113
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1749
02:06:20,933 --> 02:06:21,414
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Mayes?

1750
02:06:21,434 --> 02:06:21,734
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1751
02:06:22,314 --> 02:06:23,255
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice-President O'Connor?

1752
02:06:24,076 --> 02:06:24,316
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1753
02:06:24,956 --> 02:06:25,537
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Maxwell?

1754
02:06:25,937 --> 02:06:26,197
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1755
02:06:27,078 --> 02:06:27,678
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Penta?

1756
02:06:27,738 --> 02:06:30,040
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely not.

1757
02:06:30,560 --> 02:06:30,841
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1758
02:06:30,901 --> 02:06:33,903
[SPEAKER_15]: With a vote of five in the affirmative, none in the negative, the measure passes.

1759
02:06:40,091 --> 02:06:40,271
[SPEAKER_06]: Sir.

1760
02:06:41,233 --> 02:06:41,593
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening.

1761
02:06:42,334 --> 02:06:44,397
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave.

1762
02:06:44,558 --> 02:06:50,326
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't think it's appropriate to bring up things, bringing pals up and endorsing them and thanking them.

1763
02:06:50,386 --> 02:06:53,491
[SPEAKER_06]: This is about the city of Medford and the problems we have.

1764
02:06:53,611 --> 02:06:54,973
[SPEAKER_06]: And Mr. Knight is out of order.

1765
02:07:00,222 --> 02:07:07,206
[SPEAKER_11]: With the clouds of negativity that sometimes surround this room, I think it's very important that we point out some of the good things that are also happening in this community, Mr. President.

1766
02:07:07,246 --> 02:07:17,971
[SPEAKER_11]: And quite frankly, I think being appointed a vice president of an international union is very important, very important to his family, very important to the people that work in that union, very important to the people that work in that union and live in this community, Mr. President.

1767
02:07:18,331 --> 02:07:21,493
[SPEAKER_11]: I bring the matter forward because it's a momentous occasion, not for any other reason.

1768
02:07:21,733 --> 02:07:26,055
[SPEAKER_11]: And for people to paint it another way is totally inaccurate, totally inappropriate, Mr. President.

1769
02:07:26,075 --> 02:07:26,275
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1770
02:07:26,476 --> 02:07:27,256
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Counselor.

1771
02:07:30,582 --> 02:07:35,683
[SPEAKER_23]: Mr. President, we're talking about acknowledgements and, and, and acknowledging people for what they did.

1772
02:07:35,983 --> 02:07:41,865
[SPEAKER_23]: This gentleman is part of the same union who came to this city of Medford and harassed people and bullied people.

1773
02:07:41,905 --> 02:07:42,485
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor.

1774
02:07:42,685 --> 02:07:43,185
[SPEAKER_15]: That's it.

1775
02:07:43,565 --> 02:07:44,385
[SPEAKER_15]: That's it.

1776
02:07:44,485 --> 02:07:49,866
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Max, you asked to be recognized.

1777
02:08:00,302 --> 02:08:00,823
[SPEAKER_15]: The records.

1778
02:08:03,105 --> 02:08:03,806
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Camuso.

1779
02:08:04,386 --> 02:08:09,652
[SPEAKER_07]: I would be remiss if I didn't congratulate the gentleman on his appointment as vice president.

1780
02:08:10,212 --> 02:08:16,659
[SPEAKER_07]: And sometimes people forget a community like Medford has over 500 members of the local 25.

1781
02:08:16,739 --> 02:08:18,881
[SPEAKER_07]: We disposed of the matter.

1782
02:08:18,962 --> 02:08:19,182
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, OK.

1783
02:08:19,262 --> 02:08:19,642
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry.

1784
02:08:19,662 --> 02:08:20,543
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

1785
02:08:21,084 --> 02:08:23,026
[SPEAKER_15]: The gentleman at this podium will speak.

1786
02:08:23,897 --> 02:08:25,297
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello, Mr. President.

1787
02:08:25,417 --> 02:08:26,438
[SPEAKER_12]: My name is Michael Wajiro.

1788
02:08:26,778 --> 02:08:28,198
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to make a quick announcement.

1789
02:08:28,818 --> 02:08:33,000
[SPEAKER_12]: First off, I wanted to thank all of the wonderful people that put up these beautiful trees.

1790
02:08:33,060 --> 02:08:35,240
[SPEAKER_12]: It's quite beautiful and on a different note.

1791
02:08:35,620 --> 02:08:37,121
[SPEAKER_12]: I wanted to mention something really quick.

1792
02:08:37,141 --> 02:08:41,122
[SPEAKER_12]: I have right here, I've been circulating a petition to review our charter.

1793
02:08:41,182 --> 02:08:48,084
[SPEAKER_12]: Both of the incoming candidates and our incoming administration wants to review the charter.

1794
02:08:48,224 --> 02:08:53,165
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to, I ask everyone to participate now in this conversation.

1795
02:08:53,930 --> 02:08:58,253
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, there's going to be a meeting at the library on December 10th at six 30.

1796
02:08:58,773 --> 02:09:00,215
[SPEAKER_12]: Everyone is welcome to attend.

1797
02:09:00,935 --> 02:09:05,058
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, so we can all discuss this as an open and forum possible.

1798
02:09:05,438 --> 02:09:06,139
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you.

1799
02:09:16,686 --> 02:09:17,186
[SPEAKER_24]: Council members.

1800
02:09:17,267 --> 02:09:19,508
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. President, I just want to thank Mike Ruggiero.

1801
02:09:19,568 --> 02:09:23,451
[SPEAKER_24]: He's spent countless hours knocking doors, going around,

1802
02:09:24,108 --> 02:09:39,033
[SPEAKER_24]: uh, city events, trying to get signatures for a charter review, which I think everyone behind this railing and every resident in this community feels is appropriate that, uh, there'd be a review of our charter that was enacted some 28 years ago.

1803
02:09:39,654 --> 02:09:41,454
[SPEAKER_24]: And I just wanted to personally thank him.

1804
02:09:41,474 --> 02:09:48,037
[SPEAKER_24]: Uh, he seems to be a one man band and, uh, and, uh, I know this is going to be helpful in moving this issue forward.

1805
02:09:50,318 --> 02:09:50,638
[SPEAKER_15]: The right.

1806
02:09:50,658 --> 02:09:50,938
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1807
02:09:50,958 --> 02:09:51,358
[SPEAKER_15]: Counselor.

1808
02:09:51,883 --> 02:09:55,444
[SPEAKER_15]: The records of the meeting of November 21st were passed to Councilor Camuso.

1809
02:09:55,784 --> 02:10:00,045
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Camuso, did you have a moment to inspect those records and how do you find them?

1810
02:10:01,305 --> 02:10:03,646
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of Councilor Camuso for approval of the records.

1811
02:10:03,666 --> 02:10:04,446
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

1812
02:10:05,006 --> 02:10:05,746
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

1813
02:10:06,067 --> 02:10:06,967
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President.

1814
02:10:10,808 --> 02:10:15,889
[SPEAKER_11]: We may have a piece of unfinished business reporting the committee paper out today that we had the committee of the whole on for a public hearing.

1815
02:10:17,249 --> 02:10:17,729
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yes.

1816
02:10:18,770 --> 02:10:19,790
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, Councilor Knight.

1817
02:10:21,392 --> 02:10:28,213
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, we did have a committee of the whole meeting this afternoon at five 30 relative to setting the FY 16 tax rate, Mr. President.

1818
02:10:28,754 --> 02:10:34,575
[SPEAKER_11]: And, um, I believe, uh, it was the finding of the committee to have several questions answered, but to put this on for a public hearing next week.

1819
02:10:38,156 --> 02:10:38,536
[SPEAKER_15]: Very good.

1820
02:10:38,556 --> 02:10:45,417
[SPEAKER_15]: So we have the public hearing on the 8th of December next, uh, Tuesday here in the council chambers at 7 PM.

1821
02:10:45,717 --> 02:10:45,917
[SPEAKER_15]: Correct.

1822
02:10:46,497 --> 02:10:46,877
[SPEAKER_15]: Very good.

1823
02:10:47,378 --> 02:10:47,658
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1824
02:10:47,698 --> 02:10:48,078
[SPEAKER_15]: Counselor.

1825
02:10:48,538 --> 02:10:49,038
[SPEAKER_15]: My apologies.

1826
02:10:49,078 --> 02:10:49,578
[SPEAKER_15]: Counsel Max.

1827
02:10:50,541 --> 02:11:07,488
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. President, if I could also, as part of the site plan review of the project that took place on Riverside Ave, the Panera, the Smashburger, and the noodles, part of the site plan review and approval by this council was to repair the sidewalks adjacent to the project.

1828
02:11:07,869 --> 02:11:15,592
[SPEAKER_24]: They poured beautiful sidewalks on the side of the proposed plan, but we're supposed to fix the crosswalk.

1829
02:11:16,528 --> 02:11:20,313
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, and also, uh, fix the sidewalks on the other side of the street.

1830
02:11:20,853 --> 02:11:27,081
[SPEAKER_24]: So if we can ask that of site plan review, uh, to see where that sits, it may be the city solicitor to see where that sits.

1831
02:11:27,762 --> 02:11:28,122
[SPEAKER_15]: Very good.

1832
02:11:29,684 --> 02:11:31,306
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion for adjournment by council.

1833
02:11:31,526 --> 02:11:33,108
[SPEAKER_15]: So all those in favor.
