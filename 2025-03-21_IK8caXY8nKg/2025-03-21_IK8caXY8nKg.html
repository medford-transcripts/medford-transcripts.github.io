    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=144.723s">Okay,</a>  again, I was asked to provide a briefing. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=148.466s">I'll</a>  roll right into that as short, as briefly as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=153.889s">My</a>  project right now is 23% complete. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=159.633s">Short-term</a>  look ahead, what you'll be seeing over the next few weeks, we'll be focusing, continuing to focus on the installation of the temporary bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=171.059s">This</a>  will be followed with the roadway tie-ins to that temporary bridge, and then we will, that bridge will eventually carry northbound traffic into Clipper Ship Drive. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=187.265s">We're</a>  planning on progressing that over the next couple of weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=190.286s">We're</a>  hoping to have that bridge open by mid to late December. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=196.189s">That's</a>  currently our goal, and we're looking pretty good for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=201.445s">Then</a>  we're going to, to tie all this in, we're going to have to get new crosswalks going to establish the phase three work zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=210.747s">That</a>  will be phase three traffic switch. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=213.728s">That</a>  will allow us to start work on the eastern portion of the bridge, of the existing bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=221.27s">To</a>  do that, we're going to have to install crosswalks, line painting, barrier installation. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=226.391s">We're</a>  going to have to relocate that bus stop in front of the restaurant. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=230.358s">We're</a>  gonna have to get the traffic signals active, temporary traffic signals active. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=237.603s">Along</a>  with this, national grid relocation work will be concurrent with that work. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=243.287s">Once</a>  the temp bridge is open and we're in the phase three configuration, we're gonna begin the demolition and rehabilitation of that eastern portion of the bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=253.213s">That's</a>  full demolition of the super end substructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=258.277s">We're</a>  gonna have to enclose the, <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=260.748s">in</a>  water portion in cofferdams. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=266.67s">We're</a>  gonna then start rebuilding the new bridge, new steel beams, new concrete decks. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=272.812s">We'll</a>  be then paving, tying it all in. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=276.814s">This</a>  will of course begin January, this coming January, and will be complete by September of 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=288.377s">We'll</a>  then roll into phase four, which will allow us to shift traffic onto the new bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=294.561s">We'll</a>  then begin work on the demolition and reconstruction of the western portion of the bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=300.544s">That,</a>  very similar to the eastern portion, that'll begin September 2017 and last through August of 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=313.272s">That</a>  time, we'll pretty much be done with our bridge work. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=318.114s">reestablish</a>  the islands, reopen the ramp, finish off the job site, and we'll be complete with the project by November of 2018 when everything will be in its normal traffic pattern and everything will return back to normal. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=336.084s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=337.305s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=338.526s">That's</a>  your synopsis?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=339.466s">That's</a>  a quick rundown. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=340.927s">Be</a>  happy to entertain any questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=342.708s">I</a>  do have one question for the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=345.11s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=345.87s">Go</a>  ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=347.898s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=348.678s">Um,</a>  traffic stop relocation. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=351.419s">Last</a>  time we spoke, uh, you all wanted to weigh in on the subject of proposed, uh, for a temporary bus, I'm sorry, bus stop relocation. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=362.341s">Uh,</a>  the bus stop in front of the restaurant needs to be relocated cause that's got to become a work zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=367.722s">So</a>  we propose, I'm sorry, that's going to be in part of the, <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=373.575s">work</a>  zone in front of the restaurant. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=375.056s">We're</a>  going to barrier across there. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=376.557s">So</a>  pedestrians can't get buses, can't get in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=385.024s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=385.765s">Anyway,</a>  we've sent to the council a proposal on three locations and we get into the time that we need a decision on that to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=397.994s">Sorry,</a>  that wasn't forwarded to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=400.736s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=400.896s">It's</a>  forwarded to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=402.117s">We</a>  do need a,</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=403.741s">decision</a>  on that, not to lay work. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=405.783s">I</a>  think what, um, the gentleman is alluding to is that there was a communication made to the, um, point of information Councilor Penter in one second. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=413.529s">There</a>  was a communication made, uh, from the department of transportation, uh, to the, uh, city. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=420.375s">I</a>  think it was, uh, filtered, uh, through, uh, to the mayor's office and also, uh, to the department of, uh, the developed community development. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=433.142s">uh,</a>  the, uh, traffic commission, chief of police and the city engineer for response. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=438.804s">And</a>  I think the, uh, as coordinator of that communication, I think, uh, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=443.766s">DiLorenzo</a>  was waiting for a, uh, continued feedback or some feedback from the other offices, uh, to report back to the, uh, uh, department of communication, uh, point of information, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=459.271s">I</a>  also want to, uh, take this opportunity that, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=462.466s">Other</a>  members of the team representing the Department of Transportation, Mr. Donny Daly, who is the Chief Legislative Liaison of the Department of Transportation, members of Zoppel Construction, and also with us is the Right Honorable Paul J. Donato, State Representative and Leader of the House of Representatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=486.042s">Councilor</a>  Penta.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=487.143s">Two</a>  points. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=487.604s">I</a>  appreciate the fact that you're here, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=490.457s">First</a>  of all, I have no idea about this communication that was sent, so I'm assuming one of the reasons why you're here, because the council has asked you folks to be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=497.979s">We</a>  would like to believe that there's been weekly meetings with people in this building, and you folks, and Zappa Construction on the bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=506.24s">We've</a>  been asking for updates, and this was all foreign to us as of a week ago, so the question is, is that true or false? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=513.302s">Have</a>  you been meeting with people?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=514.842s">On</a>  this particular project, in this building? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=517.203s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=518.772s">do</a>  not recall building. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=520.612s">It</a>  hasn't been biweekly. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=521.993s">No,</a>  we have met at any time upon request. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=525.213s">You</a>  have a meeting at our field office with, but have you met with another, which the department of public works OCD, anyone like you have, we've been meeting with those representatives biweekly. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=534.336s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=534.636s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=535.356s">At</a>  our field office, at your field office. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=537.036s">And</a>  that's, and that's what we had asked for. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=538.536s">You</a>  know, we'd asked for updates as it relates to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=540.817s">And</a>  we never got a response back from anybody as it relates to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=544.638s">Go</a>  ahead.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=545.66s">Excuse</a>  me. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=546.12s">My</a>  name is Peter Trimontosi. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=547.08s">I'm</a>  the area engineer on the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=548.681s">Mark</a>  Shay does attend our progress meetings as does Dennis McDougal. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=553.062s">Um,</a>  and Cassandra is invited every single week. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=555.982s">So</a>  they do send a representative to our five week.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=558.383s">That</a>  may be them. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=559.023s">This</a>  is the council wanting to find out because when we get questions asked to us by the taxpayers and the residents and folks that are using the bus stops, we don't have answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=566.985s">And</a>  that's the reason why the sense of frustration has taken place. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=569.885s">If</a>  you're meeting with them and we're asking for reports and minutes to the meetings, we get nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=574.206s">because</a>  nothing's come back.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=575.647s">No,</a>  nothing against you.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=576.527s">I</a>  just want to know you have met with these people. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=578.949s">That</a>  is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=579.589s">Good.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=579.829s">That's</a>  all you need to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=580.75s">That's</a>  number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=581.751s">Number</a>  two, as it relates to the issue regarding the bus stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=584.632s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=585.493s">Um,</a>  again, from further information that's been given to us, and I think the city clerk can attest to the fact the gentleman from the MBTA has indicated he will not come out to a night meeting to discuss bus stops. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=596.059s">I</a>  mean, where are we going with this? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=598.281s">If</a>  this is supposed to be working together, <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=600.962s">This</a>  can't work like that if they're not going to come out at nighttime to meet with us.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=604.203s">Yeah,</a>  I can't speak on behalf of the MBTA. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=606.664s">Are</a>  you aware of that? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=607.945s">I</a>  do not know of any communications to that effect.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=610.806s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=611.206s">Well,</a>  maybe in your bailiwick of inventory of folks, you can figure out how to get them here because the bus stop comes under the control of the council, as you know.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=619.889s">Understood.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=620.389s">And</a>  I believe the way it is tabled now is that once we've decided upon an appropriate location, we simply request that location to them and they will <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=630.955s">accommodate</a>  that request.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=632.095s">And</a>  one other thing, if you can do this, um, you indicate that there are certain folks that are going to be affected and they are, if you walk around those businesses in the square, nobody has contacted them telling them of other bridge that took place a few weeks ago when you started doing some work there, the change in the time, the work, the work schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=651.259s">There's</a>  gotta be more communication because you know, business the way it is, it's tough to begin with and trying to keep your doors open. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=658.0s">You</a>  meet all your expenses, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=660.201s">This</a>  is a huge project. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=661.121s">We</a>  know that it's going to take place until 2017, but if there's no actual personal contact and conversation with the business owners, you're going to have a hard time, you know, selling the project because you're having a hard time selling it to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=675.264s">But</a>  now you're telling me, and I'm glad they appreciate that people in the city are, you know, we have not gotten that response. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=680.344s">We</a>  don't even know what this lady you're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=682.365s">So</a>  Mr. Clerk, if we can ask, can you copy the letter? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=685.865s">We</a>  don't know about this letter about the bus stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=687.906s">Just</a>  hearing about it for the first time. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=691.588s">Do</a>  you have a copy that you could give us?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=693.489s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=694.329s">We</a>  have a copy right here.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=698.03s">You</a>  sent it November 18th. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=701.891s">Well,</a>  and who'd you address, Mr. Daly? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=704.752s">Who'd</a>  you address that to? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=708.153s">Could</a>  you make a copy of the letter? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=711.593s">That's</a>  not the letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=712.414s">That's</a>  the letter?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=713.454s">That's</a>  not the letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=714.374s">Those</a>  are the proposed locations.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=715.735s">Do</a>  you have a copy of the letter, Mr. Daly? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=722.591s">Please,</a>  for all the councillors.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=727.653s">We</a>  have a couple people in queue.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=729.914s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=732.115s">If</a>  the gentleman could just give us the three locations while we await the letter, I think it would be helpful.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=738.697s">And</a>  if I'm correct, these are three temporary locations for the purpose of construction mitigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=745.02s">Thank</a>  you, yeah, I think in lieu of the letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=751.47s">chair</a>  recognizes Council Penter.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=754.072s">Are</a>  you all through? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=755.493s">I'm</a>  just concerned over the fact that is there a time requirement to this letter?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=760.116s">You</a>  were looking for an answer by, we need to give, it's our understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=765.039s">We</a>  need to give the MBTA two weeks notice for that relocation to take effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=772.003s">We're</a>  looking to <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=773.27s">get</a>  this in place in just over two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=775.712s">So</a>  time is running short. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=777.013s">So</a>  to not delay the project.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=778.674s">So</a>  this is their request that went out per letter, November 14th, they're looking for two week headstart. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=784.278s">We're</a>  hearing about this for the very first time and where the decision makers of where that bus stop goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=792.444s">I</a>  think you can understand where I'm coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=794.186s">It's</a>  kind of like obvious that, you know, there's been no communication, you know, and they may just have to wait.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=803.642s">Chair</a>  recognizes Vice President Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=805.844s">Thank</a>  you, President Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=808.226s">With</a>  regards to the moving of the MBTA bus stop, just so, through the council, we've met on this before, and the Commission for Persons with Disabilities is adamantly against the moving of that bus stop, so has anybody reached out to DiamaCloud or that?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=826.642s">department</a>  head, because... On November 18th, Scott forwarded me the three alternatives that's before you. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=836.186s">I</a>  sent it to Mr. DiLorenzo, forwarded that to the chief of police, Cassandra, Mr. Rumley, and the mayor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=847.811s">And</a>  we have not gotten a response. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=850.212s">So...</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=852.147s">If</a>  you could forward that letter to the commission for persons with disabilities correspond with the, um, right before Thanksgiving say she hasn't heard back and so on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=864.538s">So</a>  up until this morning we were trying to, and I, that's why we laid this to the council president on the phone this morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=869.842s">I</a>  said, I'm going to forward you what I have and we have not heard back from the city departments that we thought would weigh in. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=876.228s">So</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=877.076s">Just</a>  because they're adamantly against it, I've received documentation within the last few weeks because we did have a meeting with the MBTA last week on something else, and she thought it was on this moving and this bus stop, and you know, we've gotten...</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=892.967s">And</a>  she explained to me that that young lady did weigh in in the opposition, but we had not heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=899.23s">So,</a>  I mean, obviously, we'd weigh in whatever comment she had. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=903.632s">The</a>  way they deserve us, we wouldn't do anything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=906.114s">So</a>  we haven't heard anything back as of today, absent that.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=908.695s">So...</a>  Thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=909.796s">Yeah,</a>  if we could get those documents, that would be good. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=911.576s">Now,</a>  the second issue, Councilor Penta touched on it with regards to the project being another three years in total. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=919.06s">Is</a>  there a way that we can get updates to the business owners</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=922.701s">even</a>  if a street's being shut down or certain sections being shut down for... Tell us how you'd like that and we'll be happy to get you whatever information you like.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=930.512s">Can</a>  I make a suggestion? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=931.854s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=932.695s">I've</a>  been active with the Green Line Extension Progress project that's gone on now for 12, 13 years we've been working on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=939.913s">Every</a>  week I get, there's a Greenline website, you get on their mailing list and they send you an email every week, update on construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=948.357s">Maybe</a>  that's a simple way of creating emailing lists with this project that all stakeholders can get in on the list and get regular updates on the progress of the construction and whatever traffic alerts need to be made <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=968.254s">through</a>  that, and that's what's done with the T. So whenever Harvard Street is going to be shut down or up on School Street, Somerville, whatever they've done in this whole extension project with the bridges, everybody's gotten an update.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=982.182s">And</a>  I think that's a good recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=984.663s">Some</a>  way that business owners who want to opt in to get an email once a week or even biweekly so they know what's coming in the next two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=993.268s">I've</a>  gotten complaints with regards to restaurants in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=998.568s">two</a>  other businesses where the street was shut down for whatever it may have been, six, seven hours, and they were unaware it was gonna happen, you know, they lost, definitely lost business, lost customers. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1009.712s">So</a>  we need to be able to, whether it's through the website or through emails to businesses that wanna opt into that service. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1016.654s">And</a>  I, as one councilor, would like to get the updates, because we do get the complaints. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1020.815s">I</a>  think that's extremely important. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1022.296s">So</a>  if we could make that part of the recommendation to the contractor. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1027.203s">That</a>  will be helpful.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1029.745s">Thank</a>  you, Madam Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1031.146s">So</a>  we have been sending out this briefing like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1036.28s">bi-weekly,</a>  just give us the additional emails, and we'll add those on the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1041.444s">Just</a>  send us the email addresses. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1043.025s">We've</a>  been sending it to everybody that we've had.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1045.907s">One</a>  more group you might want to inform. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1047.949s">Point</a>  of information, Council Member. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1049.01s">One</a>  more group might be the Medford Chamber of Commerce.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1051.672s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1053.093s">Point</a>  of contact.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1054.474s">The</a>  Chamber of Commerce, Executive Director. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1057.236s">She</a>  was here today. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1058.157s">She</a>  was here.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1059.758s">Janet</a>  Donnelly is the Executive Director of the Chamber of Commerce. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1065.102s">Not</a>  a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1067.048s">We'll</a>  be in touch on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1068.69s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Camuso.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1072.132s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1072.673s">And</a>  thank you guys for coming down this evening, Mr. Daley, with your whole entourage. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1078.617s">Just</a>  a quick couple of questions on the bus stop relocation. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1081.799s">It</a>  appears that the bus stop, the three options are going across the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1085.442s">Is</a>  that correct?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1086.863s">You</a>  have to cross the ramp onto Route 16 westbound. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1092.683s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1093.103s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1093.463s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1093.844s">You</a>  do. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1094.304s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1094.564s">You</a>  have to cross both sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1095.664s">You</a>  have to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1096.145s">So</a>  if someone's waiting for a bus, the bus will stop and then they have to cross the street to get on the bus between the location that we have now, it's going to be a giant work zone and we have to get them to the other side. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1110.632s">That's</a>  my next question. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1111.512s">But</a>  let's stop with the bus stops. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1112.933s">You</a>  can't traverse that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1114.854s">There's</a>  not going to be a bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1115.854s">So</a>  you have to go across the street down and then back over.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1120.436s">But</a>  the bus stop itself, <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1122.103s">Those</a>  red dots that you have are actually across the street.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1126.525s">No,</a>  they're going to be on the same side as the restaurant. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1129.087s">The</a>  restaurant's over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1132.269s">You</a>  have to go across the street, down, and then back. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1135.871s">Back</a>  this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1137.912s">So</a>  it's going to be on the same side of the street.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1140.593s">Can</a>  you explain to people like myself that can't read construction maps, because it's very technical, <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1148.039s">Whereabouts</a>  are the three options so the viewing public will know? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1151.462s">Basically,</a>  in layman's terms.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1152.642s">You</a>  have the Route 16 overpass, one's right in the middle.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1158.947s">In</a>  the middle of the overpass? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1160.588s">Underneath.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1162.61s">Lighting</a>  will be approved and everything else if that happens? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1165.772s">I</a>  have not looked into that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1167.833s">Is</a>  it dark there?</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1168.893s">It's</a>  docked there until you guys started. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1171.715s">Now</a>  you have trucks under there with the lights at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1173.496s">So</a>  that's, yeah, that's a, but you can't count that as a construction is not on for a day then. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1179.299s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1179.58s">So</a>  that's the first location. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1180.94s">Next.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1181.161s">They're</a>  along that same stretch and one is a closer to the westbound ramp and the other one's closer to the, the westbound ramp from like that little spout.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1192.247s">So</a>  if you come from the restaurant and take a right, I'm assuming it's either on the left side of the street or on the right. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1199.2s">All</a>  three proposed stops are on the same side of the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1201.921s">I</a>  understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1202.621s">If</a>  you're in front of the restaurant, you come up to the westbound on-ramp to Route 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1206.722s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1207.342s">You</a>  take a right. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1208.863s">Now</a>  you're facing West Medford, down Route 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1211.964s">Is</a>  it on your left or on your right compared to the restaurant? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1214.944s">If</a>  you were standing at the very beginning of the ramp, it would be immediately to your left. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1219.246s">To</a>  your left. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1219.846s">So</a>  you'll actually have to cross the on-ramp to Route 16 eastbound to get to the bus stop from the existing location.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1228.078s">And</a>  that's the closest one, it assumes, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1230.482s">Yes,</a>  but that's where you will be crossing back across to that side of the ramp. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1236.551s">On</a>  the right side, if you're facing up that westbound ramp, the right side is gonna be a work zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1242.6s">So</a>  you're not gonna be able to stand there.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1244.757s">So</a>  you're gonna have to walk by the work zone to get to the bus stops underneath the ramp. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1248.699s">If</a>  you go there, you're just very confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1251.32s">Forget</a>  about the construction maps. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1252.6s">I'm</a>  having a hard time.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1255.402s">If</a>  I could show you the picture, it might be easier to describe it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1259.323s">But</a>  essentially, you're gonna be coming across.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1262.745s">So</a>  where's the restaurant? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1265.426s">The</a>  restaurant's not in the picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1266.546s">I'll</a>  get both points out. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1267.407s">Because</a>  I think we're all a little puzzled by looking at that map.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1270.528s">I</a>  got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1271.088s">Let</a>  me get another picture out here. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1273.259s">All</a>  right, here's the, it's two pictures. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1283.902s">Present</a>  location, restaurant. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1286.643s">All</a>  right, you're gonna have to get across. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1291.865s">You're</a>  gonna go across the bridge, get across again, you've got three locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1298.427s">Okay,</a>  the closest one being though, right at the on-ramp.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1301.007s">This</a>  is the westbound on-ramp, <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1303.898s">So</a>  you'd cross the street and the crosswalk, and it would be right there.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1307.241s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1307.621s">You</a>  walk a little bit further on it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1308.722s">You're</a>  going to get onto this protected portion here on the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1314.347s">Which</a>  is handicap accessible? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1315.848s">I'm</a>  going to say it's, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1317.33s">It</a>  will all be ADA accessible. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1320.432s">I'm</a>  going to say that's 20 feet from the corner, ballpark.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1326.017s">So</a>  it's probably 50 feet from the existing bus stop, maybe a little more, 75? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1329.5s">A</a>  little more than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1332.045s">Could</a>  you walk over the bridge?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1333.606s">Yeah,</a>  it's uh... I can't read the stations guys, what is it?</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1341.711s">That's</a>  what I thought, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1342.711s">It's</a>  about 500 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1343.672s">500</a>  feet, that's a lot for a senior citizen. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1347.734s">We're</a>  open to any suggestions, we'll put it wherever you want it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1350.476s">Well</a>  the problem is, we didn't even know it was an option at this point because the communication inside of this building <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1357.228s">is</a>  certainly, there's a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1359.87s">November</a>  18th, and trust me, I know how the MBTA and DOT work. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1364.534s">You</a>  guys are very good at notifying the community on what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1368.697s">So</a>  there's something else going on once it hits the network within City Hall, shall we say, the internal memos within City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1376.644s">But</a>  this is the first we're hearing about the three. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1379.967s">So</a>  I can understand the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1381.568s">They're</a>  probably coming up with a game plan which is the best, according to the professionals, the chief of police, <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1386.915s">OCD,</a>  DPW, and then bringing it to the council for final approval, where we're the approving authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1393.017s">But</a>  like you said, we were under the impression the bus stop was going to stay. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1397.898s">But</a>  that leads to my second question. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1400.718s">A</a>  work zone right in front of the restaurant, that's a bigger concern as far as the restaurant, the insurance company, the real estate agent, <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1411.695s">What</a>  do you, when you define original?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1412.675s">That</a>  is where the barrier is going to be out to establish the work zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1416.816s">There's</a>  not going to be work itself going, but you won't be able to get a bus in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1421.438s">That's</a>  where we have to divert traffic over to that Eastern side.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1426.219s">So</a>  if someone parks on, for lack of a better word, the old ring road or whatever, what do you call it now? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1432.4s">Clipper,</a>  Clipper ship drive. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1436.382s">I</a>  think that's what it's, is that right? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1439.427s">So</a>  for lack of a better word, if you park on Clipper ship drive, you're still going to get access to the restaurant, the insurance company. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1445.528s">You</a>  could still walk across the street and get on the sidewalk and then get in the restaurant, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1449.549s">It's</a>  not going to. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1450.349s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1450.709s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1451.19s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1451.47s">When</a>  you said work zone, I was just a little, uh, well, yeah, we, we can't have vehicles there though because so basically the barriers are just going to basically divert the road out towards because all the traffic coming towards Medford square from South Medford now is going to go over the new bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1467.472s">And</a>  the traffic coming from Salem Street is now going to be diverted out, away from the restaurant, down to South Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1476.659s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1477.639s">And</a>  when you say work zone, it's nothing more than a diversion of 20 feet out, 30 feet out, 40 feet out. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1483.764s">OK,</a>  I feel a lot comfortable now. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1487.386s">When</a>  you said a work zone, I was figuring fences up, and those guys couldn't get to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1491.89s">I</a>  know Mr. Veneziano wouldn't be happy about that particular. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1497.15s">With</a>  that being said, I just, I want to thank Mr. Daly and his staff too, because, uh, they, they, they obviously have been doing this communications. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1504.938s">The</a>  breakdown has been from within the walls of this very building that we sit in this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1510.724s">So,</a>  um, so if you could just keep notifying and, and, um, and I like councilor Dello Russo's idea, the green line, <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1520.452s">I</a>  mean, they've been keeping us abreast of the progress of that, probably weekly. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1525.655s">Between</a>  the DOT and the Mass Gaming Commission, I've never met two agencies that notify more on a consistent basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1534.922s">And</a>  that's something, as far as transparency, I'm very happy about. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1539.805s">The</a>  only thing the Green Line hasn't shared with us is their finances. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1543.527s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1545.369s">And</a>  hopefully, on a lighter note, <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1547.829s">I</a>  believe that's going to be in about a month or so. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1549.831s">They're</a>  going to come out with the actual report. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1552.253s">Is</a>  that fairly correct on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1554.534s">So</a>  I read that in today's Globe, but you can't take the Globe and everything else for 100%. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1561.12s">But</a>  with that being said, if you could just please keep the notifications coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1564.723s">I'm</a>  going to reach out to Mr. Daley tomorrow, give you some additional email addresses to get on the external communique. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1573.67s">Excellent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1574.21s">And</a>  one other person that has been <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1576.857s">Uh,</a>  pretty good with this and put me in touch with different, um, agencies regarding the DCR and some of the other stuff going on there has been representative Donato. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1584.898s">So,</a>  um, I know early on in this project back in June and July, there was a concern about the, um, environmental and the river and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1592.92s">And,</a>  uh, rep Donato, uh, put, uh, put the constituents from South street in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1599.001s">So,</a>  um, that, uh, that's always a good avenue of communications on, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1605.376s">for</a>  those people, too.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1606.697s">So</a>  that's about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1608.858s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1609.918s">I</a>  know there's a citizen who would like to address us. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1611.859s">If</a>  you would, please present yourself to the podium and state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Sqp6S0Yyr0A_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1620.803s">Hello.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1622.912s">My</a>  name is Rachel Tannenhaus. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1624.233s">My</a>  address is 26 Pearl Street and I am the chair of the Medford Disability Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1629.876s">So,</a>  um, welcome madam chairman. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1632.337s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1634.198s">Um,</a>  and, uh, so thank you very much for bringing up the, uh, concern, uh, Diane McLeod's concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1641.001s">And</a>  she actually sent me an email before, uh, the, the meeting last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1646.344s">Um,</a>  and I wasn't able to, <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1648.363s">make</a>  that particular meeting where she thought it was being discussed, but she had to go home sick that day, so that's why she couldn't make it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1658.05s">So</a>  am I to understand that they're looking at moving the bus stop that's in front of Carol's? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1667.317s">Is</a>  that the restaurant we're talking about, the bus stop that they're looking at moving? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1672.69s">Correct,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1674.091s">So</a>  that's, as you said, that's a huge issue for senior citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1679.413s">It's</a>  certainly a huge issue for folks with disabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1682.454s">I</a>  will never find that bus stop again if they move it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1684.855s">I</a>  gotta tell you, I'm gonna be wandering around everywhere forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1687.576s">So</a>  there needs to be some definite, like, if you did move it, there would have to be some really big indicators as to where it went. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1695.82s">But</a>  I have to tell you, I live walking distance from, <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1699.808s">Medford</a>  Square, and I take the bus because of those intersections that are there, the ones where the on-ramps are. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1707.517s">I</a>  could walk and get the exercise, and I could probably use it, but I don't really want to get flattened, so I don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1715.425s">having</a>  to cross those to get to the bus stop, also the safety issue, as you said, of putting the bus stop underneath the overpass. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1725.427s">I</a>  sometimes come back at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1728.347s">I'm</a>  traveling by myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1729.807s">I</a>  don't want to wait under that overpass. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1732.128s">I</a>  mean, no offense, it's kind of hinky. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1734.828s">And</a>  I think it is a safety issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1737.269s">I</a>  would have difficulty navigating there, even with the dog. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1740.949s">And</a>  I don't even know what somebody using a wheelchair or with <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1745.793s">or</a>  with stamina problems, some sort of condition that would have issues with stamina, I have no idea what they would do in that situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1751.438s">But</a>  I can tell you that in my situation, right now I come to Medford Square because I can take the bus and because there are good bus stops to get me back, I would just stop coming to Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1761.628s">And</a>  I know that we're doing these things to, and it's not that I don't like Medford Square, I like it a lot and I encourage people to come here. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1767.812s">but</a>  in terms of going to restaurants around that area, it would be really, I mean, you're basically, I understand wanting to revitalize the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1777.695s">I'm</a>  in favor of doing that too, but you don't want to keep populations out in the name of revitalizing the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1783.517s">So</a>  I actually would like to, and are, <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1788.799s">So</a>  the blurry guys in the front, are you the ones who gave the presentation? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1791.561s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1792.321s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1793.142s">So</a>  hi, like I said, my name is Rachel. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1795.383s">I</a>  am one of the citizens that would be impacted by moving the bus stop, but also, like I said, I am the chair of the Medford Disability Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1804.93s">Our</a>  next meeting is December the 16th at 5.30 in the evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1811.294s">around</a>  the corner here in room 201. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1815.096s">And</a>  I'll have to check with Diane McLeod, but I think I can extend to you an invitation to come if you'd like to talk to us about access around the site and also about moving the bus stop and get actual input from the disability community. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1830.304s">So</a>  if you're having difficulty hearing back from Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1834.286s">McLeod,</a>  and I know she was out sick a little bit before the holiday, <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1838.087s">then</a>  we can totally hook you up and you can get all the input you want, probably some of you didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1844.208s">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1850.189s">Mr.</a>  President, I think Mr... Who's the gentleman from the state? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1853.19s">Who's</a>  that fellow? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1855.23s">Scott.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1855.47s">Scott,</a>  please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1859.051s">Yeah,</a>  just so you know, we just were tossing around some ideas and before we <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1866.797s">I</a>  want to get some lines on paper and make sure it's absolutely doable. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1871.438s">But</a>  right now we've, we think we may have a, uh, a way of making a dedicated lane for bus stop only and leave it in its present location. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1882.622s">So</a>  we're going to develop that tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1885.003s">We'll</a>  be in touch very shortly. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1886.443s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1890.044s">We</a>  need to, we're gonna, we're gonna, <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1892.369s">I</a>  think it can be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1893.51s">We</a>  just want to make sure it can be.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1894.771s">But</a>  taking that into consideration, you said you listen to any and all ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1897.894s">If</a>  in fact that doesn't work, you could still have those buses go right into Medford square cause we had discussed as a spot of the issue and with the square is, and they could just traverse themselves around river street and come back, which is a one way. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1909.985s">And</a>  you could just reverse the one way, go on the opposite way. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1912.687s">And</a>  that would make it easier. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1913.528s">Cause</a>  don't forget you have two senior citizen buildings over there in excess of 500 people. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1917.592s">And</a>  for them to walk any further, <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1919.521s">in</a>  the end of that ring road, then to cross over and go underneath the bridge, where it'd be a lot easier just to go to Mitford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1925.524s">So,</a>  and again, folks that might have a handicap or a disability coming from Salem Street, Forest Street, or High Street would still be taking the same amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1933.308s">If</a>  not, it would be shorter for them just to walk across the square through the crosswalks, because you said you'd be making them properly and slated to be traversed. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1942.192s">So</a>  you have options that are there, and that's all that the council wanted to discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1946.552s">is</a>  what the options are, what would work the best, and it becomes very hard when you have no communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1951.294s">So</a>  I'm just throwing that out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1953.354s">Understood.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1954.355s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1955.475s">Chair</a>  recognizes Vice President Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1957.516s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1958.216s">Just</a>  so we can be sure, if Mr. Daley could come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1963.898s">You</a>  had mentioned that we can, any business owner or city councilor or anybody in the public that wants to get updates on the Craddock Bridge can go on this list. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1973.041s">How</a>  do we get them on that list or how do we? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1975.138s">just</a>  send me the emails.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1977.559s">And</a>  how do we contact you? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1978.759s">We</a>  already have a database of about how many emails we have.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1989.183s">No,</a>  but what's the contact?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1991.004s">So</a>  you have about four or five emails that are getting... Yeah, we need whatever database you have.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1998.58s">like</a>  the chamber groups and so on and so forth, and the civic groups and stuff like that.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2002.923s">And</a>  what's your email, if we could?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2005.044s">I</a>  can give you my contact.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2006.445s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2006.565s">Give</a>  us a messenger. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2011.028s">Yeah,</a>  make copies. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2015.13s">And</a>  I'll get it up to our IT department. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2018.652s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2019.072s">But</a>  we do advisories weekly on a lot of projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2021.054s">I</a>  don't know if you folks are familiar. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2022.114s">Like</a>  the Arlington Mass Ave project, we just cut the ribbon on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2024.936s">We</a>  did weekly updates and stuff like that.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2028.601s">And</a>  that will tell you if any roads are shutting down or any major work, what's coming up for the next weeks.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2034.523s">We</a>  can do that on a weekly basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2039.545s">It's</a>  pretty common practice we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2041.386s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2042.646s">And</a>  one of the other things to the chair, um, you said this was going to be a six day a week double shift project.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2049.569s">I</a>  can't speak to that also, but, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2058.672s">You</a>  want to speak to the schedule? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2062.795s">Yeah,</a>  I wouldn't.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2065.017s">Hi,</a>  just please state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2069.82s">I'm</a>  the project manager.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2073.083s">Wonderful,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2075.545s">Shift-wise,</a>  we are on a dedicated five-day work week, eight hours a day during the day, except four times. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2088.923s">when</a>  we need to catch up or B need to do things that are less disruptive at night, like setting the bridge that we did several weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2098.987s">But</a>  our schedule is daytime five days a week, eight hours a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2104.949s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2105.81s">That's</a>  your schedule now, but I believe when you folks were here, the presentation was made, it was going to be a double shift twice a week, six days a week.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2114.793s">That</a>  was never stated. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2117.825s">it</a>  is available to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2121.306s">That's</a>  the work shifts that are available to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2125.087s">So</a>  if we need those to make up schedule, we certainly will use them so that we can maintain our schedule and get our completion and be out of your hair as soon as we can.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2137.57s">Well,</a>  wouldn't it make more sense if you did double shifts twice a day? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2140.451s">We</a>  wouldn't have to wait to 2017? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2141.611s">18,</a>  excuse me.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2146.335s">That</a>  doesn't really solve the problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2148.416s">The</a>  schedule issues are wrapped around public utilities that have to make their own movements and our schedules for in-water work. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2161.261s">We</a>  can't work in the water four months a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2165.843s">It</a>  creates difficulties. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2167.964s">Within</a>  a schedule like this, if we miss two or three days and miss our water windows, <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2175.12s">we</a>  lose four or five months in the schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2180.064s">But</a>  if we get caught up and I'm ahead of schedule, I may have to sit and wait four or five months to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2188.771s">So</a>  we have to plan our work so that we work continuously, meet our milestones, and get our work done on time. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2197.537s">It's</a>  very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2200.5s">So</a>  working ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2203.46s">working</a>  really quickly to finish a certain amount of tasks and then having to go home for four months doesn't advance the cause at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2215.782s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2217.903s">I</a>  don't think it advances the cause to wait to 2018 even for 121 feet.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2224.824s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2225.344s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2225.684s">Councilor</a>  Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2227.024s">Thank</a>  you, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2228.705s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2230.165s">Mr.</a>  President, <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2231.816s">If</a>  the project manager would just come back for a second, Scott, it's, it's my understanding that the gentleman just referred to water windows and water work windows, water work windows. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2244.781s">And</a>  based upon the presentation you guys gave last time, there are certain periods of time of the year precluded from being able to work at the site based on, is it federal standard or state standard? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2255.345s">It's,</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2255.995s">It</a>  involves environmental permitting for the, there's an in water restriction. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2260.618s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2261.439s">So</a>  in terms of, so, but the project can work. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2265.581s">It's</a>  just not, you can't be in the water. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2267.843s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2267.943s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2270.905s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2272.846s">Uh,</a>  on the motion, uh, sir, if you want to, uh, address the council, please state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Robert Cappucci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2281.591s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2282.792s">I'm</a>  Bob Caputi, 71 Evans street. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2287.171s">My</a>  concern is this bus stop in the work area. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2291.352s">I</a>  would really like to know what's going to happen here. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2296.033s">Are</a>  they going to shut down that street? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2299.774s">And</a>  if so, it might help the local businesses there for whatever part of the street you're going to shut down if you allow, if it's possible, some parking there. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2312.716s">I</a>  know firsthand, I mean, we all know Carol's restaurant. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2316.421s">It's</a>  been a tradition in Medford for going on a century here. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2319.702s">He's</a>  been a friend to me, the family, a lot of you guys here, and I go there a lot, as most of you do, too, and he's losing a ton of business. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2330.167s">What</a>  I would like to also see is, you know, make sure that these construction crews that are coming in are maintaining that area in terms of eyesore and clutter and whatnot because, you know, along with <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2343.798s">regular</a>  customers of the restaurant. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2346.699s">There's</a>  also functions and groups that come in there from out of town. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2350.859s">Maybe</a>  some kind of deal can be made with Republic for a wedding special going on there or a baby shower where carols might be able to print up some cards for these folks and get them in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2365.042s">And</a>  finally, one last thing on the bus stop and what the chairman of the disability community was saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2373.015s">Maybe</a>  somebody from this body can reach out to the MBTA somehow and use that van service that they have and maybe offer some of these folks a ride if they need it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2384.263s">You</a>  know, I mean, this, I don't have to tell you folks, this is your job to make sure that the taxpayers, the businesses, and the citizens are well taken care of and that street and area is as safe and accessible as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2399.073s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2399.713s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2399.933s">So</a>  on the motion of approval by Councilor Penta, <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2403.046s">As</a>  amended, seconded by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2404.986s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2406.247s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2406.867s">Motion</a>  carries. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2408.127s">Thank</a>  you very much folks from the Department of Transportation for all your efforts and a special word of thanks to Representative Donato for his leadership in this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2420.69s">Thank</a>  you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2422.17s">Motion</a>  for suspension by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2424.55s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2426.451s">While</a>  we're under suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2427.231s">While</a>  we're under suspension, yes.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2429.431s">Last</a>  week we put a resolution forward relative to the schedule <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2432.639s">changes</a>  that were potential at the West Medford commuter rail station. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2437.102s">And</a>  I believe that we got word back from our state delegation that those changes have been put on hold for the time being until an exhaustive public hearing process can be conducted, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2449.129s">So</a>  while Representative Donato was here, I thought we should thank him for his hard work and his efforts and give him an opportunity to maybe speak on the matter if he sees fit. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2456.674s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2460.648s">Paul</a>  Donato, Representative of 35th Middle Sixth District. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2465.951s">The</a>  Medford delegation, along with Senator Lewis, who represents Winchester, had a meeting with the MBTA ten days ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2478.497s">We</a>  expressed our concern with regard to the commuter rail changes, and because of our meeting, <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2486.385s">And</a>  our advocacy, I have to tell you that the delegation worked very diligently. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2491.147s">We're</a>  not very happy with the changes that were being proposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2495.048s">And</a>  the MBTA has relinquished their position relative to the December 15th for the changes and instead is working toward April. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2508.513s">The</a>  delegation is working once again with the MBTA. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2513.194s">We</a>  plan a meeting sometime in February to <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2516.113s">continue</a>  the dialogue so that the impact of any of the changes that will be made on the commuter rail will be minimum. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2523.795s">Uh,</a>  and, and that's where we are at this particular time.</p>
