1
00:00:04,627 --> 00:00:16,750
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Medford Bites listeners, before we get into the interview for today, I wanted to take a moment to acknowledge the leaked Supreme Court draft that reflects a decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and federal abortion access.

2
00:00:17,914 --> 00:00:26,838
[SPEAKER_00]: Challi and I are taking some time pushing back on the patriarchal idea of organizing a swift response by taking time to care for ourselves during this emotional week.

3
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:37,863
[SPEAKER_00]: We will be back with more of a discussion on the topic and thoughts for how to get involved, as we still have time to speak back to this draft decision while abortion access remains available.

4
00:00:39,024 --> 00:00:43,886
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to continue by reading some of the reactions we received from community members to this news.

5
00:00:45,246 --> 00:00:46,007
[SPEAKER_00]: One listener stated,

6
00:00:46,669 --> 00:00:48,750
[SPEAKER_00]: It's horrible, terrifying, and harmful.

7
00:00:49,451 --> 00:00:51,912
[SPEAKER_00]: Worst for people who are already most marginalized.

8
00:00:52,533 --> 00:00:58,237
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not surprised given the makeup of the Supreme Court, but it's not what the majority of the American people want."

9
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:04,961
[SPEAKER_00]: Another reflected sadness, frustration, and disbelief in the hypocrisy.

10
00:01:06,222 --> 00:01:13,006
[SPEAKER_00]: A listener named Jess expressed that more white cis men need to recognize their privilege and yell about this.

11
00:01:14,687 --> 00:01:15,528
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone else remarked,

12
00:01:16,127 --> 00:01:27,556
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm angry, and even with all that we have been through in six years, I still can't believe this is where we are, still attacking women and undervaluing their right and ability to make decisions for themselves.

13
00:01:28,637 --> 00:01:34,922
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel incoherent and disappointed, angry and hopeful that it's not too late to do something to help.

14
00:01:36,424 --> 00:01:42,489
[SPEAKER_00]: Molly Keevy shared the belief that abortion access is essential to healthcare for all people.

15
00:01:43,329 --> 00:01:45,191
[SPEAKER_00]: No one is free until we can choose

16
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:48,245
[SPEAKER_00]: what we feel is suitable for our bodies.

17
00:01:48,885 --> 00:01:53,309
[SPEAKER_00]: Limiting abortion access is just another example of state-sponsored violence.

18
00:01:54,249 --> 00:01:59,954
[SPEAKER_00]: The government should not be in the business of taking away a person's agency over their body.

19
00:02:01,355 --> 00:02:10,422
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's anything you'd like to add to this conversation, or other reactions you'd like to share, please reach out by email at medfordpod at gmail.com.

20
00:02:11,604 --> 00:02:20,367
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is coming out the day after Mother's Day, and we hope that you were able to mark that day with whatever feels most present for you.

21
00:02:20,847 --> 00:02:26,249
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be grief, sadness, excitement, celebration, or a time for self-care.

22
00:02:27,289 --> 00:02:29,290
[SPEAKER_00]: We hope you all did what felt best for you.

23
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:36,392
[SPEAKER_00]: In times like this, the world can feel like an overwhelming place to be, and lots can feel out of our control.

24
00:02:37,593 --> 00:02:40,474
[SPEAKER_00]: My hope is that you can find some connection within our community.

25
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:44,649
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's guest talks about how her business is aiming to do just that.

26
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:51,172
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt really inspired by this guest's energy around community and sustainability, and I hope you enjoy.

27
00:02:51,192 --> 00:02:58,495
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for joining me today.

28
00:02:58,735 --> 00:03:03,697
[SPEAKER_00]: If we could start out just by, if you could introduce yourself with your name, pronouns, and just a bit about who you are.

29
00:03:05,331 --> 00:03:06,872
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, thanks for having me.

30
00:03:06,952 --> 00:03:08,413
[SPEAKER_01]: So my name is Claire Flaherty.

31
00:03:09,134 --> 00:03:18,120
[SPEAKER_01]: I am she hers, and I'm the owner of Trove Green Provisions, which is a new store opening up on Boston Ave in Medicine, Massachusetts.

32
00:03:19,141 --> 00:03:27,407
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is a eco-friendly, low waste, sustainable store that is also going to be offering refilling for home and body care products.

33
00:03:29,232 --> 00:03:29,612
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.

34
00:03:29,632 --> 00:03:32,374
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll break that down a little bit in the rest of the interview.

35
00:03:33,014 --> 00:03:34,115
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you could start.

36
00:03:34,215 --> 00:03:42,300
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question that I ask everybody that I meet with on the podcast is what their favorite place to eat is in Medford and what they like to eat there.

37
00:03:44,868 --> 00:03:51,211
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I could say absolutely this is my favorite thing because it changes depending on my mood.

38
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:58,034
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, just before this interview, I ran to Colette's and got quiche Lorraine for breakfast.

39
00:03:58,094 --> 00:04:03,656
[SPEAKER_01]: So right at this moment in time, that is my favorite restaurant because I'm eating a delicious French breakfast.

40
00:04:04,616 --> 00:04:05,177
[SPEAKER_00]: Solid choice.

41
00:04:05,237 --> 00:04:06,078
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it does.

42
00:04:06,638 --> 00:04:08,339
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a hard question, and it changes.

43
00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:09,700
[SPEAKER_00]: It can change by the day, for sure.

44
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,201
[SPEAKER_00]: It can, yes.

45
00:04:11,822 --> 00:04:16,686
[SPEAKER_01]: We're very lucky, I think, that we've got a lot of great food options that can cover every whim.

46
00:04:19,167 --> 00:04:30,356
[SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned your business, Drove Green Provisions, and so maybe we could sort of start from the beginning, and if you could talk about what prompted you to start this business or to think about starting this business.

47
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,382
[SPEAKER_01]: So origin stories are always really interesting, right?

48
00:04:34,422 --> 00:04:41,145
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you think is the prompt for a business often later kind of reveals itself to have not been.

49
00:04:41,226 --> 00:04:47,889
[SPEAKER_01]: But I guess my journey in this particular business started about four years ago.

50
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:58,796
[SPEAKER_01]: I was making body care products as a hobby, kind of an extended hobby for relaxation and selling them to friends and family.

51
00:05:00,437 --> 00:05:06,582
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was really enjoying that and I was doing lots of fairs and events.

52
00:05:07,442 --> 00:05:16,649
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started listening and noting that the kind of natural skincare business side was really taking off.

53
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:20,652
[SPEAKER_01]: There were, fairs were getting bigger, there were lots of local soap makers, there were lots of local

54
00:05:22,652 --> 00:05:26,194
[SPEAKER_01]: artisans really kind of honing in on the natural side of life.

55
00:05:27,174 --> 00:05:34,857
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started listening to my customers who were also talking about bringing that into the rest of their home life.

56
00:05:35,097 --> 00:05:38,899
[SPEAKER_01]: So cleaning products, or particularly when they were having children.

57
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:48,183
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of when new parents started having children, they were really starting to think about the chemicals in their home, the things that they were bringing into their home.

58
00:05:48,968 --> 00:05:52,809
[SPEAKER_01]: from a kind of safety and parental view.

59
00:05:53,749 --> 00:06:00,170
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, as a parent, I have two kids, was also reflecting on that a little bit.

60
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:06,171
[SPEAKER_01]: I think when you're working full time and you have children, things can get really busy and you can fall into convenience.

61
00:06:06,951 --> 00:06:16,733
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for whatever reasons, I kind of paused for a minute and started thinking about what cost that convenience was having.

62
00:06:17,652 --> 00:06:21,813
[SPEAKER_01]: either in the products I was choosing or in the environment at large.

63
00:06:21,933 --> 00:06:23,934
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started doing some research in that.

64
00:06:24,154 --> 00:06:36,037
[SPEAKER_01]: And I found that I was more comfortable thinking about if we could get as natural as possible, if we could get to plant-based products, our lives would surely be better.

65
00:06:37,658 --> 00:06:44,180
[SPEAKER_01]: And as that journey kind of unfolded, I unpacked where my life and my journey had gone.

66
00:06:46,137 --> 00:06:48,737
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm from England, I was born and raised in England.

67
00:06:49,238 --> 00:07:03,540
[SPEAKER_01]: I was born and raised to working class parents who didn't have a lot, but we made do and part of my heritage has farming in it and school teaching and kind of being practical.

68
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:13,322
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've always had this family vein of make your hobby practical, make it giftable and make it kind of,

69
00:07:14,322 --> 00:07:18,564
[SPEAKER_01]: helpful and tied to the land in a way that brings community.

70
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:27,587
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as you develop and grow as an adult, you don't really think about these things bubbling away in you and forming you as a person.

71
00:07:27,627 --> 00:07:33,570
[SPEAKER_01]: But as I became a parent, I just became more aware of that side of my personality and my upbringing.

72
00:07:35,571 --> 00:07:37,072
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really wanted to get back to that.

73
00:07:37,212 --> 00:07:41,156
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt I was moving away from that kind of center of myself.

74
00:07:41,256 --> 00:07:42,717
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really wanted to move back to it.

75
00:07:43,217 --> 00:07:47,140
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I started to add to the skincare and to natural home goods.

76
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:49,803
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I've always wanted to own a store.

77
00:07:49,823 --> 00:07:51,404
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always wanted to own a store.

78
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:53,606
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been one of those little childhood dreams.

79
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:55,067
[SPEAKER_01]: I ran stores in my home.

80
00:07:55,087 --> 00:07:58,310
[SPEAKER_01]: I ran stores outside, in the yard.

81
00:07:58,330 --> 00:07:59,090
[SPEAKER_01]: And I

82
00:08:02,343 --> 00:08:26,143
[SPEAKER_01]: lit up on the idea of opening a store that could focus on the things that made me happy and that would maybe be a space for the community to talk about and discover new ideas about living a little bit more naturally and living in a way that is more sustainable as we see, you know, the effects of the climate crisis and we see the effects of environmental

83
00:08:27,224 --> 00:08:29,845
[SPEAKER_01]: damage that human living is causing.

84
00:08:30,445 --> 00:08:34,306
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's kind of where I came to it philosophically.

85
00:08:34,326 --> 00:08:39,807
[SPEAKER_01]: The journey to the physical space has been a little bumpy.

86
00:08:40,647 --> 00:08:42,728
[SPEAKER_01]: COVID and the pandemic didn't help.

87
00:08:42,908 --> 00:08:48,249
[SPEAKER_01]: I had intended to start this in 2019, about two weeks before schools closed.

88
00:08:49,823 --> 00:08:56,271
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it took a little bit of a break, but the space that I'm in right now is

89
00:08:57,967 --> 00:09:01,749
[SPEAKER_01]: just down the street from my house and has been empty for a really long time.

90
00:09:01,869 --> 00:09:09,592
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've had my eye on that space for a while and I've been asking about it and asking about it to the developer for a long time.

91
00:09:09,652 --> 00:09:19,257
[SPEAKER_01]: So my journey to the space is just as long and winding, but so satisfying once it's actually all come together.

92
00:09:19,277 --> 00:09:23,919
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really long-winded way of talking about my journey here.

93
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:25,640
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.

94
00:09:26,945 --> 00:09:27,446
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem.

95
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:44,925
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I think the third kind of leg to the stool is I with social media and not being in my homeland, per se, I did start to see a Europe and in England in particular.

96
00:09:47,347 --> 00:10:05,785
[SPEAKER_01]: as a economical and kind of community and economical side of it, as much as the environmental and climate change action, more of buy what you need, don't overbuy, and that kind of movement of being a little bit more fiscally responsible and

97
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:07,852
[SPEAKER_01]: tightening of belts.

98
00:10:07,912 --> 00:10:18,147
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that came out of COVID and I was seeing a lot of that in Europe and so that kind of informed that kind of third aspect of the business model that

99
00:10:18,698 --> 00:10:26,161
[SPEAKER_01]: we do tend to overbuy and we can control the amount that we buy if we refill.

100
00:10:27,161 --> 00:10:30,282
[SPEAKER_01]: We can control how much we need and how much we're bringing into our home.

101
00:10:30,302 --> 00:10:45,427
[SPEAKER_01]: We might not have the storage space for large amounts, but that we can therefore as a community take kind of responsibility for how much waste we create if we're refilling our product bottles

102
00:10:45,807 --> 00:10:50,729
[SPEAKER_01]: but being able to do it and take advantage of bulk buying at the same time.

103
00:10:51,549 --> 00:11:02,354
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the kind of journey that I wound my way through and created what I think is going to be a really exciting community space.

104
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:06,351
[SPEAKER_00]: So he said, sounds like it.

105
00:11:06,511 --> 00:11:17,716
[SPEAKER_00]: And you described kind of these goals of sustainability, thinking about like fiscal responsibility, not overbuying, and also this sense of maybe like enhanced community.

106
00:11:17,736 --> 00:11:20,757
[SPEAKER_00]: And so how's your store solving those problems?

107
00:11:20,777 --> 00:11:23,618
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you describe kind of what people can expect when they go in?

108
00:11:24,765 --> 00:11:30,207
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so the store is kind of set into two different sides.

109
00:11:30,267 --> 00:11:34,728
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now I have one side which is devoted to the refilling section.

110
00:11:34,868 --> 00:11:40,930
[SPEAKER_01]: So to think about refilling as all the options of the products that you could think of.

111
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:45,271
[SPEAKER_01]: So laundry powder, detergents, dishwashing,

112
00:11:46,417 --> 00:11:56,399
[SPEAKER_01]: materials, body care items such as like shampoo and conditioner, the things that come in the bottles that we buy and that we use frequently in our home, cleaners, things like that.

113
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:07,842
[SPEAKER_01]: So the things that we are consuming on a quite regular basis within our homes that we would either recycle the bottle or throw the bottle away and go buy another one.

114
00:12:09,283 --> 00:12:10,683
[SPEAKER_01]: The kind of

115
00:12:11,845 --> 00:12:21,810
[SPEAKER_01]: project behind refilling is that you bring that bottle, you buy that one bottle, and then you just refill it for as many times as the bottle will allow.

116
00:12:23,071 --> 00:12:32,636
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only are you consuming the product, but then you're not perpetuating the kind of waste cycle of a new bottle and a new bottle and a new bottle.

117
00:12:33,155 --> 00:12:42,602
[SPEAKER_01]: So that I have one side of the store which is dedicated to to refilling so people can bring in their own bottles, if they don't have a suitable container they can buy a container.

118
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:48,707
[SPEAKER_01]: And that way we can we can lower how much waste, we're creating as a community.

119
00:12:49,267 --> 00:12:52,370
[SPEAKER_01]: The other side of the store is is dedicated to.

120
00:12:53,991 --> 00:12:59,997
[SPEAKER_01]: sustainably minded and eco-friendly products that are not always refillable.

121
00:13:00,017 --> 00:13:11,187
[SPEAKER_01]: So things like wool dryer balls that reduce the amount of electricity and power that you need to dry your clothes if you're drying them in a dryer.

122
00:13:12,508 --> 00:13:14,209
[SPEAKER_01]: Cleaning sponges and things like that.

123
00:13:14,269 --> 00:13:20,455
[SPEAKER_01]: So the things that kind of go along with the refillable products and the working tandem.

124
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:36,418
[SPEAKER_01]: And the third part of the community aspect of it, if you're coming in to get your home consumables and body care products, we can also be a space for you to bring hopefully your hard to recycle items.

125
00:13:36,598 --> 00:13:43,163
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really important that we become a, I want to become a hub for ideas or questions or

126
00:13:44,734 --> 00:13:58,008
[SPEAKER_01]: visiting talks, you know, local artists, you know, a place where we can all be as a community and think about these issues in a practical way and in a way that doesn't doesn't make you feel bad, but makes you feel empowered.

127
00:13:58,869 --> 00:14:06,677
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my that's my kind of hope for the store that it can be this convening place for people who are interested and want to do their part.

128
00:14:07,856 --> 00:14:15,480
[SPEAKER_00]: So imagine that, you know, when I think about those items that you mentioned and how I buy them, it's like I probably throw them in my grocery cart or whatever it is.

129
00:14:16,001 --> 00:14:19,062
[SPEAKER_00]: And how often am I buying them?

130
00:14:19,082 --> 00:14:23,205
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we're buying huge containers of laundry detergent, for example.

131
00:14:24,245 --> 00:14:34,308
[SPEAKER_00]: I imagine like if I was buying that in less of an amount, but more frequently and going into a store like this, I'd be having that interaction with somebody in my community and sort of building those relationships.

132
00:14:34,788 --> 00:14:36,949
[SPEAKER_00]: And it might be more of an enjoyable experience too, right?

133
00:14:37,369 --> 00:14:38,029
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope so.

134
00:14:38,369 --> 00:14:38,689
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

135
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:41,050
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you say- I meant to think about it.

136
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:41,730
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

137
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:47,352
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say in terms of the large containers of laundry detergent, a lot of that is water.

138
00:14:47,652 --> 00:14:58,920
[SPEAKER_01]: actually so some, a lot of the products that we carry are concentrated versions, so you can use less of the product and not have that giant container, you know, kind of eating up your shelf space.

139
00:15:00,321 --> 00:15:05,925
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the aspects of you thinking about how we live in our spaces and thinking about what we want to store there.

140
00:15:09,022 --> 00:15:11,663
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope it's going to be a place where people can connect.

141
00:15:11,683 --> 00:15:13,104
[SPEAKER_01]: That's certainly how I saw it.

142
00:15:14,345 --> 00:15:19,007
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I opened the store I was at the farmers market, the Medford farmers market for a year.

143
00:15:19,767 --> 00:15:24,990
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, and I will be doing it again this year because it was just such a great community experience to

144
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:47,073
[SPEAKER_01]: to have people coming up to your store and who've gotten the greens or who've gotten the vegetables and then they're talking to each other and they're picking up products and they're, I really like this, I really like this, I've never really thought about that, you know, that's the kind of aspect where you can recommend things to people and expand on your little product world, I guess.

145
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:52,155
[SPEAKER_00]: You said something about hard to recycle.

146
00:15:53,756 --> 00:15:55,037
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you say more about that, what that means?

147
00:15:55,857 --> 00:16:12,706
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so there's a great desire, I think, and I think it's getting stronger amongst the majority of people that we need to recycle the materials that are coming into our houses and our places of living.

148
00:16:13,466 --> 00:16:14,787
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time,

149
00:16:15,768 --> 00:16:31,239
[SPEAKER_01]: there's an unfortunate creep in what they call wish cycling, which is that we're putting items in recycling containers that we hope are recyclable, or we think may be recyclable, or we kind of wish were recyclable.

150
00:16:31,259 --> 00:16:37,284
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and they're often not in terms of the streamline

151
00:16:41,551 --> 00:16:54,860
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some items that are just not able to be processed in those facilities, for example, the soft plastics, so the things like bread bags cling wrap that kind of that kind of stuff that gets into the gears of the.

152
00:16:56,564 --> 00:16:58,105
[SPEAKER_01]: recycling plant, you can't put it in there.

153
00:16:59,145 --> 00:17:07,170
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you just did an experiment for a week and you looked at that type of plastic, that in itself is everywhere.

154
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:11,072
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you're really trying hard, it's on a lot of things.

155
00:17:11,252 --> 00:17:16,495
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there are lots of things like that that need to be recycled in a specialist way.

156
00:17:17,115 --> 00:17:20,497
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's an emerging space in that

157
00:17:21,437 --> 00:17:25,719
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some companies who are kind of taking it on themselves.

158
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:35,263
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know I when I do my grocery shopping, you can take soft plastics to to the grocery store and some of the grocery stores and you can put them in there.

159
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:38,784
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm, I'm hoping to expand on that.

160
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:42,406
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now I I do the soft plastics.

161
00:17:43,126 --> 00:17:49,288
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just was accepted into the actual Gillette razor recycling program.

162
00:17:49,348 --> 00:17:50,769
[SPEAKER_01]: So Gillette sponsors

163
00:17:51,929 --> 00:18:04,176
[SPEAKER_01]: recycling through a company called Terra Cycling, where they will accept and recycle any shaving product, packaging, blades and handles.

164
00:18:04,856 --> 00:18:09,419
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't have to be Gillette per se, but they are paying for that recycling.

165
00:18:09,479 --> 00:18:10,960
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're in that program.

166
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,543
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can bring those things in and then we will send them off and they will get separated and made into new things.

167
00:18:18,047 --> 00:18:22,389
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm hoping to expand on those types of programs those things that you're like, I want.

168
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:26,451
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to trash this, but I don't know where to take it.

169
00:18:30,385 --> 00:18:34,668
[SPEAKER_01]: it's hard and you need it to be convenient and you need it to be understandable and easy.

170
00:18:35,188 --> 00:18:38,350
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, it just it's too easy to just put it in the trash.

171
00:18:39,711 --> 00:18:49,257
[SPEAKER_01]: But the way to think about it is, you know, when you like say you're throwing something away, there isn't a way for a lot of a lot of items.

172
00:18:49,317 --> 00:18:53,340
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, many plastics stick around for

173
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,471
[SPEAKER_01]: least 500 years.

174
00:18:57,472 --> 00:19:01,934
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's quite a long time for a little plastic razor.

175
00:19:03,455 --> 00:19:04,055
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

176
00:19:04,075 --> 00:19:10,878
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and when you say the soft plastics, you're collecting those and then what happens to those when you like, how do they?

177
00:19:10,938 --> 00:19:14,720
[SPEAKER_01]: So I collect those and then I send, yeah, I send them to a company.

178
00:19:15,141 --> 00:19:17,382
[SPEAKER_01]: TerraCycle is one of the larger companies that recycle.

179
00:19:19,062 --> 00:19:28,144
[SPEAKER_01]: soft plastics and different products, actually, and they will break them down and send them to different manufacturers to remake into something else.

180
00:19:29,485 --> 00:19:39,087
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I think a lot of that is also whether I'm physically doing it myself or just finding the people connecting the dots in a way so that, you know,

181
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,831
[SPEAKER_01]: mattresses or something like that.

182
00:19:41,891 --> 00:20:05,944
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm certainly not going to be accepting mattresses in the store, but if I know where for people to take them, I can have that list available and it can just be a little bit more of a clearinghouse in a way, a community hub of where we can find the answers to those questions that we have, which I would like to be kind of the community leg of the store.

183
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:07,905
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what questions do you have and how

184
00:20:08,912 --> 00:20:10,692
[SPEAKER_01]: together, can we find out the answer?

185
00:20:11,593 --> 00:20:15,094
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like a nice combination with some of the other resources that we have in Medford.

186
00:20:15,334 --> 00:20:25,036
[SPEAKER_00]: Last week, I talked to Stephanie Johnson, who owns Swaffitt, and we have a great everything is free network in the town too.

187
00:20:26,117 --> 00:20:31,338
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are some items like mattresses, you mentioned in particular, nobody wants somebody's old mattress usually, right?

188
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:46,999
[SPEAKER_00]: and this seems great like there are lots of options right to to like recycle or reuse or like re-gift and then also it seems great to like be able to go to your store and hear about like if I don't know what to do with this item what are my options

189
00:20:47,539 --> 00:20:47,719
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

190
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:50,620
[SPEAKER_01]: And I might not know either, but that's part of the fun, right?

191
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,661
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do we learn?

192
00:20:51,841 --> 00:20:52,641
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we find out?

193
00:20:53,041 --> 00:21:04,346
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the answer is not readily available, then as a community, we can start asking the questions to new sets of leaders or community, find out why can't we do this?

194
00:21:05,226 --> 00:21:08,247
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's the important next step, right?

195
00:21:08,287 --> 00:21:14,690
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do know the things we can do as a community and a society to live more sustainably

196
00:21:15,896 --> 00:21:20,520
[SPEAKER_01]: For our own good, not just for the planet, for humans' existence, not just the planet.

197
00:21:22,402 --> 00:21:24,865
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if we don't know, how do we change it?

198
00:21:24,965 --> 00:21:26,446
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we change the system?

199
00:21:26,687 --> 00:21:28,148
[SPEAKER_01]: What questions do we need to ask?

200
00:21:28,909 --> 00:21:32,652
[SPEAKER_01]: And how can we move the needle a little bit?

201
00:21:33,641 --> 00:21:35,283
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate that perspective.

202
00:21:35,323 --> 00:21:49,217
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like some of these big ideas like sustainability, like living in a plant-based way or economically, I think they can feel really overwhelming when you think about them and like, I have to do this perfectly.

203
00:21:49,497 --> 00:21:50,998
[SPEAKER_00]: And I appreciate that perspective of like,

204
00:21:51,619 --> 00:22:00,701
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some things that we just don't know how to do yet, or some of us might not understand and being able to have an accessible way of talking about that feels like it can make a big difference.

205
00:22:00,721 --> 00:22:01,021
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, right.

206
00:22:01,081 --> 00:22:03,462
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not this like kind of pie in the sky idea.

207
00:22:03,502 --> 00:22:05,442
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that we can learn together.

208
00:22:06,042 --> 00:22:06,242
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

209
00:22:06,302 --> 00:22:12,203
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't need, we don't need two or three people living perfectly in a sustainable way.

210
00:22:12,283 --> 00:22:15,624
[SPEAKER_01]: We need lots of people doing it imperfectly, but wanting to be better.

211
00:22:16,164 --> 00:22:19,185
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's, that's kind of where I would like.

212
00:22:20,337 --> 00:22:29,260
[SPEAKER_01]: the store to be known as, it's a judgment-free zone in how far you're going on the journey, right?

213
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:36,962
[SPEAKER_01]: Each step you make is important and does need to be celebrated and encouraged.

214
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:45,745
[SPEAKER_01]: So if the only thing you're doing is buying laundry powder in a container that you can refill, that's great.

215
00:22:47,306 --> 00:22:53,912
[SPEAKER_01]: and I think that it can feel like that in the environmental sustainable space.

216
00:22:54,133 --> 00:23:09,848
[SPEAKER_01]: It can feel a little intimidating, it can feel a little exclusionary, it can feel a little privileged a lot of the time and I don't want it to be and so I am aware of those things and I want to try and

217
00:23:10,462 --> 00:23:14,585
[SPEAKER_01]: address them as we expand as a company, because we're new and learning.

218
00:23:15,845 --> 00:23:19,087
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will be the first one to admit that I'm not perfect either.

219
00:23:19,488 --> 00:23:21,129
[SPEAKER_01]: I have an active family.

220
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:22,069
[SPEAKER_01]: I have two kids.

221
00:23:22,289 --> 00:23:23,010
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a dog.

222
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:23,670
[SPEAKER_01]: I have two cats.

223
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:25,491
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a very busy house.

224
00:23:25,611 --> 00:23:37,619
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there are ways to balance those without making yourself feel guilty all the time, walk around feeling the shame.

225
00:23:39,777 --> 00:23:48,399
[SPEAKER_00]: And can you explain, so if you, I'm just imagining like the different types of containers you might bring in to refill, how does that change like the cost?

226
00:23:48,479 --> 00:23:52,540
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it like a, like volume price or how do you figure that out?

227
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,460
[SPEAKER_01]: So the refilling is as a price per ounce.

228
00:23:55,620 --> 00:24:01,262
[SPEAKER_01]: So what will happen is you bring in your container, we will tar the container weight wise.

229
00:24:01,302 --> 00:24:07,783
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know how much the container weighs, and then you only pay for the amount of the products that you put into that container.

230
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:17,356
[SPEAKER_01]: And that way you can bring in a giant bottle and it'll be the same price per ounce as somebody bringing in a mason jar.

231
00:24:17,917 --> 00:24:21,502
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just paying for the amount of the product you are buying.

232
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:28,820
[SPEAKER_00]: and I imagine you could bring in a tiny mason jar and test some of these things out if you were kind of working.

233
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:41,011
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that would be the best option, especially if there are multiple scents and multiple approaches to products.

234
00:24:41,031 --> 00:24:43,693
[SPEAKER_01]: So a good example is laundry detergent in that

235
00:24:44,133 --> 00:24:52,741
[SPEAKER_01]: I have laundry powder, dry powder, I have laundry sheets, the detergent sheets, and then I also have concentrated liquid.

236
00:24:52,941 --> 00:25:03,590
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is a matter of preference, and it's a matter of scent profiles, and washing machines, and the types of clothes you're washing.

237
00:25:04,171 --> 00:25:08,615
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a little bit of trial and error in finding the thing that works for you.

238
00:25:08,635 --> 00:25:09,956
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think that's one of the

239
00:25:11,315 --> 00:25:19,522
[SPEAKER_01]: scary things about buying an eco-friendly, in quotation marks, product that you, is it going to work as well?

240
00:25:19,542 --> 00:25:22,804
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it going to cost more?

241
00:25:23,025 --> 00:25:32,212
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it going to be more annoying to either source or use in some way?

242
00:25:32,292 --> 00:25:38,758
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I would hope that people would come in and try things out and then give feedback, right?

243
00:25:39,881 --> 00:25:44,517
[SPEAKER_01]: part of the process of owning a store is listening to customers and finding out what's working, what's not working.

244
00:25:45,451 --> 00:25:48,593
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't possibly use every single product in the store in my home.

245
00:25:49,233 --> 00:25:57,038
[SPEAKER_01]: I do a lot of them, but that's part of how do we as a community say, this is a great product, we really like that.

246
00:25:57,758 --> 00:26:05,963
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will say one of the things that I am trying to do at the store is to be as local as possible and small business minded.

247
00:26:06,003 --> 00:26:13,687
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do have a value set of the providers of the products that I do have in the store.

248
00:26:14,225 --> 00:26:24,492
[SPEAKER_01]: in terms of, you know, geographical location, trying to keep in the New England area as much as possible to cut down on shipping costs and shipping distances.

249
00:26:25,672 --> 00:26:33,457
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, marching down the list of, you know, is it a small business, family business, minority or female owned businesses?

250
00:26:33,577 --> 00:26:39,841
[SPEAKER_01]: The different layers that I go through in trying to find the right fit of product for the store.

251
00:26:41,728 --> 00:26:42,388
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is tricky.

252
00:26:45,009 --> 00:26:47,170
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a favorite product or one that you use the most?

253
00:26:49,531 --> 00:26:49,931
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.

254
00:26:50,451 --> 00:26:51,772
[SPEAKER_01]: The multi-surface cleaner.

255
00:26:52,372 --> 00:26:58,514
[SPEAKER_01]: It's by a Texas-based company, but they actually have a manufacturing plant in Massachusetts called Puracy.

256
00:26:58,975 --> 00:27:03,236
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's scented green tea and lime scent.

257
00:27:03,416 --> 00:27:06,237
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just the most heavenly scented thing.

258
00:27:08,191 --> 00:27:09,352
[SPEAKER_01]: I use it everywhere.

259
00:27:09,712 --> 00:27:12,554
[SPEAKER_01]: I use it in bathroom, kitchen, floors.

260
00:27:13,034 --> 00:27:14,515
[SPEAKER_01]: It's truly multi-surface.

261
00:27:14,815 --> 00:27:18,958
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's probably one of my favorite because I can use it everywhere.

262
00:27:18,978 --> 00:27:23,000
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to have something that, I don't have to have specialized product for every area of the home.

263
00:27:23,401 --> 00:27:26,483
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have my spray bottle and I zoom around the house.

264
00:27:29,042 --> 00:27:36,184
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's the best way for people to learn more about you, or if you could say where exactly you're located?

265
00:27:36,204 --> 00:27:36,765
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sure.

266
00:27:37,725 --> 00:27:42,707
[SPEAKER_01]: So our retail store is located at 330 Boston Ave.

267
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:44,247
[SPEAKER_01]: We're right next to the Danish Pastry House.

268
00:27:45,688 --> 00:27:47,388
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a website.

269
00:27:47,428 --> 00:27:49,389
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's trovegreenprovisions.com.

270
00:27:50,193 --> 00:27:50,834
[SPEAKER_01]: all one word.

271
00:27:51,955 --> 00:27:56,719
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the best way to either pop in, we're going to have our grand opening in the next couple of weeks.

272
00:27:56,939 --> 00:28:00,722
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we will start it, our aisles will be expanding during the summer.

273
00:28:01,923 --> 00:28:07,188
[SPEAKER_01]: So the best thing to do would actually be to go to the websites, we'll be putting up our new hours as they

274
00:28:07,675 --> 00:28:22,988
[SPEAKER_01]: evolve as to what the community is needing in terms of hours I think that's, we're right by Tufts University so it's going to be an interesting balance of when students are here versus when families do their shopping.

275
00:28:23,669 --> 00:28:26,491
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of curious as to what that's going to look like.

276
00:28:28,188 --> 00:28:29,689
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, that's a nice area down there.

277
00:28:29,709 --> 00:28:33,050
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get your coffee and your pastry and then refill.

278
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:34,731
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a dangerous food.

279
00:28:35,571 --> 00:28:38,072
[SPEAKER_01]: And now pizza.

280
00:28:38,132 --> 00:28:39,192
[SPEAKER_01]: I got penis pizza.

281
00:28:39,232 --> 00:28:40,973
[SPEAKER_01]: I can get, I can get Mexican.

282
00:28:41,013 --> 00:28:41,913
[SPEAKER_01]: I can get burritos.

283
00:28:41,973 --> 00:28:44,714
[SPEAKER_01]: I can get, you know, um, Turkish food.

284
00:28:44,794 --> 00:28:47,055
[SPEAKER_01]: I can, it's, it's actually really great.

285
00:28:47,155 --> 00:28:52,157
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really great, um, little commercial zone.

286
00:28:52,357 --> 00:28:53,217
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think I, I,

287
00:28:55,373 --> 00:29:05,281
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to be here selfishly because it's near my home, but also because it is a little microcosm of commercial needs.

288
00:29:05,301 --> 00:29:10,645
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can get what I need at the hardware store to repurpose or refinish something.

289
00:29:11,406 --> 00:29:12,266
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a laundromat.

290
00:29:12,286 --> 00:29:16,690
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all the things that you would need for kind of little communal living here.

291
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:19,212
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully we can add to that.

292
00:29:20,218 --> 00:29:27,250
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, and it sounds like to it's close to your home, but I think it's close to a lot of people's home so in terms of people being able to walk or their bikes things like that.

293
00:29:27,791 --> 00:29:32,099
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do deliver we do deliver to other parts of medford so that's certainly.

294
00:29:33,376 --> 00:29:35,758
[SPEAKER_01]: on the table as an expanding thing.

295
00:29:36,859 --> 00:29:47,328
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we do have a program where it almost like, so as I said, I grew up in England and we still had the milk deliveries in England when I was growing up, which I know some people do here.

296
00:29:47,388 --> 00:29:53,293
[SPEAKER_01]: So the milk delivery, you would leave the bottles outside and then they would exchange them for new ones.

297
00:29:53,974 --> 00:29:59,219
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm hoping to get the same process for products so that you leave your empties outside,

298
00:29:59,819 --> 00:30:01,300
[SPEAKER_01]: and then get them refilled.

299
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:06,943
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that it can kind of keep that cycle going even if you're not able to come up to the physical location.

300
00:30:07,823 --> 00:30:10,464
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's definitely on our service list.

301
00:30:11,185 --> 00:30:11,625
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool.

302
00:30:12,705 --> 00:30:13,506
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I learned a lot.

303
00:30:13,586 --> 00:30:20,349
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there was lots of different things that I hadn't thought about in terms of what goes into some of these products that we use all the time.

304
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:22,230
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much.

305
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:23,250
[SPEAKER_01]: You're welcome.

306
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:24,651
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for inviting me.

307
00:30:24,931 --> 00:30:26,992
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I look forward to coming into the store soon.

308
00:30:27,813 --> 00:30:28,213
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.

309
00:30:37,522 --> 00:30:38,724
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much to Claire.

310
00:30:38,744 --> 00:30:40,788
[SPEAKER_00]: I really can't wait to visit the shop.

311
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:48,063
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find updates about the shop's progress by following them on Instagram or at their website, which I have linked to in the show notes.

312
00:30:49,054 --> 00:30:51,576
[SPEAKER_00]: A special thanks to all of you who ordered Pride t-shirts.

313
00:30:52,056 --> 00:30:55,879
[SPEAKER_00]: We shattered the fundraising goals and I can't wait to see you all wearing them out and about.
