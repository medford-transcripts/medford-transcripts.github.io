[SPEAKER_11]: Not yet.

32
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,380
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Sohir?

33
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,101
[SPEAKER_11]: Mayor Wendell Kern?

34
00:02:36,282 --> 00:02:36,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Present.

35
00:02:36,803 --> 00:02:38,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Six present, one absent.

36
00:02:49,412 --> 00:02:52,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we could decide how we want to go through this.

37
00:02:52,253 --> 00:02:57,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we want to go through, um, the first 10 rules on page two?

38
00:02:58,456 --> 00:03:00,517
[SPEAKER_02]: See if there's any questions or concerns.

39
00:03:03,278 --> 00:03:05,259
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, I can start, I can start.

40
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:07,159
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm in favor of doing that way.

41
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:08,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

42
00:03:10,601 --> 00:03:13,142
[SPEAKER_02]: A question from the chair then on rule rule number two.

43
00:03:15,097 --> 00:03:22,740
[SPEAKER_02]: where we wouldn't need a caucus like this past January, that would be just my question on number two.

44
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:28,523
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe we can just make it so a caucus is optional, obviously, if you have to hammer things out.

45
00:03:28,903 --> 00:03:35,426
[SPEAKER_02]: But where we had a pretty in agreement and went right to the floor, I just wanted to point that out.

46
00:03:36,426 --> 00:03:36,966
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Ruseau?

47
00:03:38,027 --> 00:03:41,028
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it says actually after each biennial election.

48
00:03:42,348 --> 00:03:43,629
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's actually only every two years.

49
00:03:46,152 --> 00:03:50,656
[SPEAKER_02]: but it would be after the biennial election, which was this year, and we didn't caucus.

50
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:52,338
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, we did.

51
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,542
[SPEAKER_11]: How did we elect myself and vice chair?

52
00:03:56,702 --> 00:03:57,423
[SPEAKER_11]: That was our caucus.

53
00:03:57,463 --> 00:04:06,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, we caucused during the, okay, I'm used to the city council where we would caucus at like 6.40, 6.30, and then go on the floor and make it public.

54
00:04:08,493 --> 00:04:08,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Madam Mayor.

55
00:04:10,424 --> 00:04:16,908
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, actually, I think we might've done that the last time, sort of like a baby committee of the whole or something.

56
00:04:16,968 --> 00:04:21,991
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't really have a strong preference for either method that we did.

57
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:28,074
[SPEAKER_11]: My first two terms, I think we actually did have a little meeting before the regular meeting.

58
00:04:29,475 --> 00:04:34,278
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't find it to be difficult to just include it as an agenda item in our regular meeting.

59
00:04:34,698 --> 00:04:38,981
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have strong preference, but I certainly agree it should only be every two years.

60
00:04:42,361 --> 00:04:42,741
[SPEAKER_13]: Mayor.

61
00:04:44,542 --> 00:04:45,062
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

62
00:04:45,922 --> 00:04:51,644
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a question that I'd like to start with before we really go into the specific rules.

63
00:04:51,704 --> 00:05:09,769
[SPEAKER_13]: And I guess I wanna know the difference between or what we're defining is the difference between the rules and the policies, because I know that even around this question of caucus, we have a policy on our policy, which should be a handbook, frankly, but isn't.

64
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:16,994
[SPEAKER_13]: According to our policy, we're supposed to have a handbook that's available in the superintendent's office and also that's shared with each of us.

65
00:05:17,915 --> 00:05:22,397
[SPEAKER_13]: So what I'm doing now is putting it together in a Google Doc that can be searchable.

66
00:05:23,018 --> 00:05:33,104
[SPEAKER_13]: And we can look at that in the Google Doc if folks want, but I think even to this point, there's something in the policy about, and we haven't been doing it, but there's something in the policy about

67
00:05:33,664 --> 00:05:46,270
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, electing the chair and the vice chair and how, and how that process occurs with, it doesn't, I don't think it says caucus specifically, but I can look, I can do a find right now if people are interested in hearing what it says in our policies.

68
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:58,315
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I guess backing it up a little bit, I'm trying to understand what's the difference between the proposed rules and our current policy, and are we, are rules superseding the policy, in which case,

69
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,921
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm curious about that too, because we have a policy about how to change policy.

70
00:06:03,121 --> 00:06:05,642
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's like, it's just, it's a lot.

71
00:06:06,123 --> 00:06:13,206
[SPEAKER_13]: So I am, you know, again, I sent you guys a link to the document for policy and also to the proposed rules.

72
00:06:13,226 --> 00:06:18,628
[SPEAKER_13]: So we can do a find if we need to, but I just wanna make sure that we're all clear on what we're doing.

73
00:06:19,088 --> 00:06:20,008
[SPEAKER_13]: Please, thank you.

74
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:26,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Attorney Greenspan.

75
00:06:28,612 --> 00:06:29,252
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mayor.

76
00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:40,415
[SPEAKER_01]: Just on that point, you have an online policy manual that's online at the MASC.

77
00:06:41,615 --> 00:06:55,764
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of these policies that are in front of us tonight are consistent with the online manual.

78
00:06:58,442 --> 00:07:00,543
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a couple that aren't.

79
00:07:02,363 --> 00:07:24,090
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think you do have to make clear whether when you accept this document as a whole, if you're overriding the online policy manual, just for example, on one quickly is that on this number nine, it has school committee meetings will be held on the first and third Monday at 6 p.m.

80
00:07:26,252 --> 00:07:33,857
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the policy manual, which is capital B, capital E, it says 7 p.m.

81
00:07:35,218 --> 00:07:52,951
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are a few of those things that you just have to make clear that if it's inconsistent with your online manual, that this is going to be what you're going to use going forward.

82
00:07:54,704 --> 00:07:56,566
[SPEAKER_13]: But if I may, Mayor.

83
00:07:57,147 --> 00:08:09,240
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, just procedurally to, and I don't know this is probably for Howard as well or procedurally the manual has like a procedure in place for how to change policy so that's the question are we like.

84
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:15,656
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think there's a way that you waive the rights to change policy.

85
00:08:15,816 --> 00:08:19,399
[SPEAKER_13]: We have to look at the policy manual again in order to do this.

86
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:23,243
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think that it says that we have to place on the agenda a policy change.

87
00:08:23,283 --> 00:08:24,564
[SPEAKER_13]: The policy has to be discussed.

88
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:28,227
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the next meeting, the policy can be changed.

89
00:08:28,448 --> 00:08:29,909
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, that's in the

90
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:31,511
[SPEAKER_13]: the online policy manual.

91
00:08:31,531 --> 00:08:36,676
[SPEAKER_13]: So I don't, I guess I'm trying to back up to like what's rules, what's policy, how are we differentiating?

92
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:41,260
[SPEAKER_13]: If we can sort of maybe get to that, that would be really helpful.

93
00:08:41,741 --> 00:08:42,061
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

94
00:08:49,896 --> 00:09:03,550
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so I was actually going to bring up number nine, because last year, Paulette and I we put forth a resolution to change the start times of the meetings to 630.

95
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:07,354
[SPEAKER_10]: And because we had received feedback from the public.

96
00:09:08,075 --> 00:09:32,115
[SPEAKER_10]: last school year um that they preferred to start at 7 p.m and we had gotten we we had started at just different times like we were starting at 5 sometimes 6 sometimes 6 30 so we as a group um accepted the resolution and chose 6 30 you know as a happy medium for the public administrators etc um so i mean if

97
00:09:35,896 --> 00:09:40,401
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I guess like, how does everybody else feel about that start time?

98
00:09:40,921 --> 00:09:51,512
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, could we try it at six and we might have to change this rule if it's not working out for the community, you know, to make it to the meetings.

99
00:09:55,656 --> 00:09:58,779
[SPEAKER_14]: Member Graham and then member Ruseau.

100
00:10:01,391 --> 00:10:07,358
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, so I think anytime you make a change like this you first have to agree on like.

101
00:10:08,659 --> 00:10:12,924
[SPEAKER_14]: What the new thing will be, and then you have to go back and true up.

102
00:10:14,606 --> 00:10:21,154
[SPEAKER_14]: You know where else you might have documentation so from my perspective rules are things that govern this body.

103
00:10:21,894 --> 00:10:39,820
[SPEAKER_14]: Policies are things that the superintendent must carry out as she runs the district so to me this document is about how we will operate as a school committee of which the superintendent is not a member of the school committee policies are policies that.

104
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,931
[SPEAKER_14]: the superintendent is expected to carry out.

105
00:10:41,951 --> 00:10:44,712
[SPEAKER_14]: So frankly, we've never had a rules document.

106
00:10:45,052 --> 00:10:50,294
[SPEAKER_14]: So we threw rules in our policies, which was the incorrect step in my opinion, way back when.

107
00:10:50,314 --> 00:10:56,376
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think the first thing we need to do is talk about these rules as they are presented to us.

108
00:10:56,976 --> 00:11:08,561
[SPEAKER_14]: And then if we agree that this is the right set of rules, then somebody needs to go through the policies and put motions on the floor to remove the policies.

109
00:11:09,346 --> 00:11:15,088
[SPEAKER_14]: But I don't think it's even worth talking about removing a policy if we haven't agreed what a new policy is.

110
00:11:15,228 --> 00:11:33,514
[SPEAKER_14]: So I would propose we go through this document, we agree on how we believe that this body should operate, and then there needs to be an effort to go back to the policy manual and identify those places where there's conflict and they get simply removed.

111
00:11:36,797 --> 00:11:42,763
[SPEAKER_14]: I would like to see us move through this document without delay, because I do think it's important.

112
00:11:42,823 --> 00:11:47,147
[SPEAKER_14]: Clearly, we've been mishmashing these things together and causing confusion for a really long time, so.

113
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:50,230
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Ruseau, then Member McLaughlin.

114
00:11:51,832 --> 00:11:52,532
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

115
00:11:52,913 --> 00:12:00,920
[SPEAKER_11]: Since member Kreatz mentioned that we had agreed to 630, so I'd like to make a motion to amend

116
00:12:02,029 --> 00:12:10,012
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, rule nine and to strike 6 30 PM and make it six strike 6 PM and make it 6 30 PM.

117
00:12:10,632 --> 00:12:10,912
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

118
00:12:15,674 --> 00:12:19,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want, we can vote on them one at a time, I guess, to make it clear in the record.

119
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:22,751
[SPEAKER_02]: motion for approval by members.

120
00:12:23,211 --> 00:12:24,711
[SPEAKER_13]: Point of information, Mayor, sorry.

121
00:12:25,031 --> 00:12:27,972
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to get this done, too, and I think it's really important that we do have rules.

122
00:12:28,392 --> 00:12:40,235
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess my point of information is, and I appreciate through the Chairmember Graham's explanation of the perception of the difference between rules and policy, and I see it the same.

123
00:12:40,295 --> 00:12:43,456
[SPEAKER_13]: Rules, you know, policy is what is

124
00:12:44,790 --> 00:13:07,818
[SPEAKER_13]: know rules are you know intent of what the school what governs the school committee policy is how that intent is carried out and there are some issues in the rules document that are being proposed that are affecting our policy which is what member graham was saying that somebody has to go back and true up the policy manual if the rules change it but what i'm saying is is there not a fundamental sort of

125
00:13:08,368 --> 00:13:11,011
[SPEAKER_13]: issue around changing policy through rules.

126
00:13:11,031 --> 00:13:13,433
[SPEAKER_13]: Is everybody following me?

127
00:13:13,453 --> 00:13:14,234
[SPEAKER_13]: Am I making sense?

128
00:13:14,254 --> 00:13:15,094
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if I am.

129
00:13:15,935 --> 00:13:23,422
[SPEAKER_13]: We have policy manuals that some of the rules, not all of them certainly, some of the rules change what's in the policy manual.

130
00:13:23,442 --> 00:13:27,866
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess we have to know when is the rule changing the policy manual.

131
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:30,620
[SPEAKER_13]: in, you know, how that happens.

132
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:40,583
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I mean, I'm happy to do like an edit when we're, a find when we're looking at different rules to see if there's something in our policy on them and let folks know what's in the current policy, if that's helpful.

133
00:13:43,064 --> 00:13:44,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

134
00:13:45,465 --> 00:13:46,285
[SPEAKER_14]: Member Graham.

135
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:59,626
[SPEAKER_14]: I would recommend that we talk about that as it applies to a specific rule instead of hypothetically, because hypothetically speaking, we could run around this circle all day long.

136
00:14:00,126 --> 00:14:08,071
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think if we have a rule and there is a policy that's in conflict, we should talk about it and we should identify what to do about it.

137
00:14:08,171 --> 00:14:14,014
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think we should just, I think we just need to start at the top and work our way through this list.

138
00:14:14,115 --> 00:14:16,516
[SPEAKER_14]: And if there are those conflicts, we just need to identify them.

139
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:17,751
[SPEAKER_14]: as they come up.

140
00:14:18,472 --> 00:14:25,140
[SPEAKER_14]: And if this is not perfect, it's fine because we can change a rule at any point in time going forward.

141
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:29,305
[SPEAKER_14]: This is not like something we need to sign in blood.

142
00:14:29,425 --> 00:14:33,530
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think we should do our level best to get through this.

143
00:14:35,103 --> 00:14:39,646
[SPEAKER_14]: do our level best to clean up the policies because frankly, no one's done that in like 20, 30 years.

144
00:14:39,726 --> 00:14:47,410
[SPEAKER_14]: So all the efforts are welcome because I think they all create a better function.

145
00:14:48,171 --> 00:14:51,833
[SPEAKER_14]: And if we find something in a week, we just need to deal with it in a week.

146
00:14:51,913 --> 00:14:53,654
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think it's all gonna be okay.

147
00:14:53,674 --> 00:14:58,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and there's a motion on the floor to change

148
00:14:59,477 --> 00:15:03,320
[SPEAKER_02]: Number nine from 6 to 6 30 by member Ruseau, seconded by member Kreatz.

149
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,881
[SPEAKER_02]: If we could have a roll call, please.

150
00:15:06,302 --> 00:15:06,483
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

151
00:15:06,563 --> 00:15:07,083
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Graham?

152
00:15:07,944 --> 00:15:08,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

153
00:15:09,405 --> 00:15:09,885
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Hays?

154
00:15:10,526 --> 00:15:10,786
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

155
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:12,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Kreatz?

156
00:15:12,988 --> 00:15:14,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

157
00:15:14,649 --> 00:15:15,309
[SPEAKER_03]: Member McLaughlin?

158
00:15:18,112 --> 00:15:18,512
[SPEAKER_13]: Abstain.

159
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:23,536
[SPEAKER_11]: I just really think- Member Mustone?

160
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:24,076
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

161
00:15:24,116 --> 00:15:24,937
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Ruseau?

162
00:15:24,977 --> 00:15:25,998
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

163
00:15:27,058 --> 00:15:27,619
[SPEAKER_11]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn?

164
00:15:29,048 --> 00:15:31,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, five in the affirmative, one abstain, one absent.

165
00:15:32,589 --> 00:15:37,410
[SPEAKER_02]: And then member Glock, motion passes for the change to number nine.

166
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:41,771
[SPEAKER_02]: And then member McLaughlin, did you wanna speak?

167
00:15:44,692 --> 00:15:44,952
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

168
00:15:46,692 --> 00:15:46,932
[SPEAKER_06]: Mayor?

169
00:15:48,313 --> 00:15:50,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Ruseau, we're on to number 11.

170
00:15:50,893 --> 00:15:51,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I...

171
00:15:55,310 --> 00:16:00,152
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought we were still on number one or two, but everybody gets their one through 10 comments, so I'm sorry.

172
00:16:01,452 --> 00:16:02,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.

173
00:16:02,953 --> 00:16:05,194
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're starting with one through 10, so you can ask.

174
00:16:06,454 --> 00:16:06,754
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

175
00:16:07,635 --> 00:16:21,180
[SPEAKER_11]: Also on number nine, I would like to remove, add after June, pursuant to policy BE-meetings, since that's not there and there is a policy.

176
00:16:32,628 --> 00:16:42,994
[SPEAKER_03]: motion by member Rousseau, seconded by second member Graham roll call.

177
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:44,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Graham?

178
00:16:45,435 --> 00:16:45,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

179
00:16:46,836 --> 00:16:47,496
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Hays?

180
00:16:48,157 --> 00:16:48,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

181
00:16:49,538 --> 00:16:50,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Kreatz?

182
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:58,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, did you hear me?

183
00:16:59,163 --> 00:16:59,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sorry.

184
00:16:59,503 --> 00:17:00,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I had it.

185
00:17:04,605 --> 00:17:05,305
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Mustone.

186
00:17:07,807 --> 00:17:10,589
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Mustone is not here yet, I don't think.

187
00:17:10,689 --> 00:17:11,790
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Ruseau, yes.

188
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,531
[SPEAKER_11]: Mayor Lundgren.

189
00:17:14,251 --> 00:17:17,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, five in the affirmative, one abstain, one absent.

190
00:17:17,574 --> 00:17:18,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

191
00:17:24,678 --> 00:17:28,041
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's no further questions on one through 10, we're gonna move to 11 through 20.

192
00:17:34,187 --> 00:17:34,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Attorney Greenspan.

193
00:17:35,948 --> 00:17:36,648
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, thank you.

194
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:37,349
[SPEAKER_01]: Just on 11.

195
00:17:43,311 --> 00:17:45,012
[SPEAKER_01]: The remote technology piece.

196
00:17:46,493 --> 00:17:50,975
[SPEAKER_01]: The current legislation for that expires in April.

197
00:17:51,655 --> 00:17:53,136
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bill pending.

198
00:17:54,817 --> 00:17:58,299
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe in the house that would extend that to July.

199
00:17:58,319 --> 00:17:58,379
[SPEAKER_01]: But

200
00:18:01,903 --> 00:18:09,906
[SPEAKER_01]: all depending on the state of those emergency amendments to the open meeting law.

201
00:18:11,986 --> 00:18:18,028
[SPEAKER_01]: Remote technology is only available if allowed by statute.

202
00:18:18,168 --> 00:18:30,252
[SPEAKER_01]: Prior to COVID, there were remote meeting participation regulations promulgated by the attorney general's office, but you still needed a quorum in person.

203
00:18:31,331 --> 00:18:40,855
[SPEAKER_01]: So my only comment on the remote technology is that it's gotta be consistent with the requirements of the open meeting law.

204
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:46,417
[SPEAKER_02]: We can add that language in at the end, consistent with the requirements of open meeting law.

205
00:18:49,859 --> 00:18:55,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Ruseau, Kreatz, and then Graham.

206
00:18:55,241 --> 00:18:59,023
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually it was last, but.

207
00:18:59,657 --> 00:19:01,739
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, I thought that's how the hands went up, sorry.

208
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,161
[SPEAKER_11]: That's okay.

209
00:19:05,622 --> 00:19:15,952
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Greenspan, so if we add simply, you know, as allowed by law, that would be fine?

210
00:19:17,193 --> 00:19:17,413
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

211
00:19:17,433 --> 00:19:24,239
[SPEAKER_11]: So I make a motion to amend number 11 to include as allowed by law.

212
00:19:29,513 --> 00:19:31,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me.

213
00:19:31,576 --> 00:19:31,556
630.

214
00:19:32,737 --> 00:19:34,260
[SPEAKER_02]: And is it optional in August?

215
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Did we meet in August the last two years?

216
00:19:36,483 --> 00:19:38,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Should we make this optional?

217
00:19:40,409 --> 00:19:42,212
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, member Kreatz and then member Graham.

218
00:19:43,925 --> 00:19:46,187
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep, so I'm not ready to vote on this yet.

219
00:19:46,287 --> 00:19:47,588
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't get to speak on it yet.

220
00:19:48,008 --> 00:19:52,692
[SPEAKER_10]: I did have concerns about the meeting in August.

221
00:19:53,253 --> 00:19:55,835
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not in favor of having a meeting in August.

222
00:19:56,315 --> 00:20:00,319
[SPEAKER_10]: We haven't had meeting in August and I've been on school committee for six years.

223
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:08,606
[SPEAKER_10]: Last year and the year before during COVID, we got an email from the superintendent with an update.

224
00:20:09,386 --> 00:20:11,787
[SPEAKER_10]: And that went very well.

225
00:20:12,867 --> 00:20:22,169
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I would like to make a friendly amendment to have an email communication from the superintendent with an update.

226
00:20:22,709 --> 00:20:33,911
[SPEAKER_10]: And if members have questions or concerns, they could speak directly with the superintendent during the summer over the phone if they have any questions or concerns.

227
00:20:36,249 --> 00:20:53,319
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm making a motion to amend this to, there will be, the superintendent will send out a broadcast communication to the committee members in August, maybe the first Monday.

228
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:58,542
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think what she was doing actually, I'm sorry, she was sending out updates every week.

229
00:21:00,774 --> 00:21:03,675
[SPEAKER_10]: So let me just get back to what I was saying.

230
00:21:03,755 --> 00:21:18,921
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm making a motion to amend this to say the superintendent will send out a broadcast communication to all members, a brief broadcast memo to all members each week in August.

231
00:21:19,701 --> 00:21:24,963
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't have to be on a Monday, maybe on the Friday at the end of the week.

232
00:21:28,165 --> 00:21:28,665
[SPEAKER_13]: Second.

233
00:21:30,046 --> 00:21:31,307
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, it has to be an amendment, right?

234
00:21:31,327 --> 00:21:33,128
[SPEAKER_13]: We have to accept the amendment first for the motion.

235
00:21:35,349 --> 00:21:36,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Or reject.

236
00:21:40,253 --> 00:21:45,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me just collect myself, because we have one motion on the floor to amend the language.

237
00:21:46,136 --> 00:21:58,344
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's to... I'm gonna let member Graham speak, and then member McLaughlin, then member Ruseau.

238
00:22:03,033 --> 00:22:08,216
[SPEAKER_14]: I am in favor of having a meeting in the month of August.

239
00:22:08,396 --> 00:22:19,022
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's really completely reasonable to expect a body that is responsible for the schools in our district to meet before the start of school.

240
00:22:19,523 --> 00:22:21,504
[SPEAKER_14]: So it doesn't have to be a long meeting.

241
00:22:21,724 --> 00:22:28,908
[SPEAKER_14]: I like that it could be remote to the extent that that remains an option, but I am in favor of an August meeting.

242
00:22:31,636 --> 00:22:34,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Member McLaughlin, Member Ruseau, then Attorney Greenspan.

243
00:22:37,241 --> 00:22:37,642
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll pass.

244
00:22:37,702 --> 00:22:43,647
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm waiting for another item, but I would be fine with Zoom if folks were fine with that for the August meeting.

245
00:22:46,529 --> 00:22:50,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Zoom might not be an option because it's only allowed through April.

246
00:22:50,413 --> 00:22:52,395
[SPEAKER_02]: It may get extended through July.

247
00:22:52,515 --> 00:22:56,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, it'll be a violation of open meeting law if the legislature doesn't extend our ability to do so.

248
00:23:00,223 --> 00:23:02,685
[SPEAKER_02]: member Ruseau, then Attorney Greenspan.

249
00:23:03,926 --> 00:23:04,366
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

250
00:23:05,067 --> 00:23:08,349
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, you know, this is my first three years.

251
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:12,233
[SPEAKER_11]: We did not have any meetings in July or August, and I greatly appreciated it.

252
00:23:12,253 --> 00:23:13,914
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an understatement.

253
00:23:14,294 --> 00:23:19,058
[SPEAKER_11]: And then my fourth year was COVID all summer.

254
00:23:19,539 --> 00:23:23,302
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe it's my first two years where no meetings and then COVID summer.

255
00:23:24,203 --> 00:23:26,324
[SPEAKER_11]: But this particular last August,

256
00:23:28,035 --> 00:23:38,084
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I don't know if you all don't get the same emails I get, but I got asked by an awful lot of people about a lot of things related to school opening, not just related to the pandemic.

257
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:47,732
[SPEAKER_11]: And there was no place to have a presentation of the opening plan.

258
00:23:47,752 --> 00:23:52,757
[SPEAKER_11]: A school committee meeting this particular August, I felt like,

259
00:23:53,877 --> 00:23:56,458
[SPEAKER_11]: frankly, it was kind of crazy we didn't do one.

260
00:23:56,558 --> 00:24:02,000
[SPEAKER_11]: There was just so much concern and questions in the community and between us.

261
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:13,944
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, the superintendent can either respond to seven of us individually, which I'm sure doesn't take a lot of time, or just to the whole body at once with an audience.

262
00:24:15,444 --> 00:24:22,787
[SPEAKER_11]: I found it really difficult that we really didn't, I personally don't reach out to the administration to expect them to do any work since

263
00:24:23,385 --> 00:24:25,746
[SPEAKER_11]: They shouldn't do any work unless the body has asked them to.

264
00:24:26,846 --> 00:24:33,747
[SPEAKER_11]: So I went into the first of the school year with the same information as any other parent who got it out of MPS.

265
00:24:34,907 --> 00:24:41,569
[SPEAKER_11]: And I will say that it felt like there wasn't enough, not that the administration wasn't doing enough, but that there was not enough information.

266
00:24:42,409 --> 00:24:47,570
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I also want to say that, you know, I wrote this particular rule.

267
00:24:49,951 --> 00:24:51,731
[SPEAKER_11]: I am also,

268
00:24:53,001 --> 00:25:06,612
[SPEAKER_11]: cognizant of the fact that I don't want the whole school committee to have to not take summer vacations or do whatever else you might do with your time in the summer.

269
00:25:06,812 --> 00:25:12,056
[SPEAKER_11]: That's sort of why this whole rule in when I wrote it is predicated on remote technology.

270
00:25:12,874 --> 00:25:26,559
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, and, um, you know, if the legislature fails to pass anything, I would probably motion to, uh, bring it to the school committee to strike it entirely because, um, or to perhaps substitute it with something.

271
00:25:26,579 --> 00:25:29,059
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, that's legal.

272
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:40,023
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't require us to meet as a body, but, um, um, you know, I, I, I think considering the demands on the, this, this body, I mean, I think.

273
00:25:40,805 --> 00:25:49,712
[SPEAKER_11]: having to figure out how to work your school, your summer plans around a meeting that hopefully will be a short meeting is too much in my mind.

274
00:25:49,812 --> 00:25:54,516
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just wanted to get out that information on the intent.

275
00:25:58,399 --> 00:25:59,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Attorney Greenspan.

276
00:26:00,081 --> 00:26:01,702
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, mayor.

277
00:26:01,882 --> 00:26:08,788
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to go back to what member Graham and McLaughlin said at the beginning.

278
00:26:09,555 --> 00:26:23,166
[SPEAKER_01]: you have a current policy, capital B, capital E, which has meetings from September to June and does not include July and August.

279
00:26:23,186 --> 00:26:32,493
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is one of those that would conflict with the current policy manual to include a meeting in August.

280
00:26:33,413 --> 00:26:36,936
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know how you wanna handle those conflicts, but this is one of them.

281
00:26:41,206 --> 00:26:42,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Could we just put it as optional?

282
00:26:43,067 --> 00:26:46,649
[SPEAKER_02]: And then any one of us can say we think we need it.

283
00:26:46,889 --> 00:26:50,991
[SPEAKER_02]: And obviously communications come all through the summer from the administration.

284
00:26:52,832 --> 00:26:57,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Where during COVID, summer with COVID, we met multiple times on different things, but.

285
00:26:58,035 --> 00:27:01,077
[SPEAKER_13]: May I offer a point of information, please?

286
00:27:01,417 --> 00:27:03,478
[SPEAKER_13]: Point of information, member McLaughlin.

287
00:27:05,045 --> 00:27:05,225
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

288
00:27:05,365 --> 00:27:22,278
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, just going back to the policy concern for changing policy, and I hate to be a stickler, but I really do feel like if we're going to follow policy and rules, then we have to follow the policy and rules, or we have to figure out what the way is to remove the policy, you know, to put in the rule or whatever.

289
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:33,087
[SPEAKER_13]: And right now, in addition to the policy that this is related to, there's also a policy in our handbook that says in order to change anything in our policy, we have to have

290
00:27:33,649 --> 00:27:42,350
[SPEAKER_13]: the specific policy on our agenda, have a discussion about it and then change it in the next session so that the community can be aware of what the policy change actually is.

291
00:27:53,392 --> 00:28:00,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Attorney Greenspan, I mean, can you maybe comment on the chicken and the egg, the egg of the chicken, like how we fix this problem?

292
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:11,773
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't reviewed the, I just don't have in front of me the policy that says what you have to do to change it.

293
00:28:13,094 --> 00:28:31,978
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think otherwise then whatever policies can be adopted here would be the policies of the committee and would overrule or override any contradictory policies in the manual.

294
00:28:32,358 --> 00:28:34,078
[SPEAKER_01]: If these are the policies you want to adopt.

295
00:28:34,889 --> 00:28:38,090
[SPEAKER_02]: These are our school committee rules and they would overrule anything in it.

296
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:47,433
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it's a policy we've written, then maybe the rules subcommittee can go through those to amend them accordingly to coincide with the rules.

297
00:28:48,754 --> 00:28:49,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully we'll get through tonight.

298
00:28:50,575 --> 00:28:51,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

299
00:28:51,955 --> 00:28:52,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Graham.

300
00:28:55,996 --> 00:28:56,897
[SPEAKER_14]: If I'm correct,

301
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:08,516
[SPEAKER_14]: Even if we voted to approve this document tonight, they would not be adopted until this also goes to the floor for a regular meeting so my suggestion would just be that.

302
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:28,453
[SPEAKER_14]: that not happen until we also put on our agenda, whatever the next agenda is that we can put it on, the things that need to be struck from the policy handbook, like policy BE, like motion to rescind policy BE, and then it can have a week of waiting and be adopted.

303
00:29:28,473 --> 00:29:32,914
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it is literally as simple as that and we should not make it more complicated.

304
00:29:34,074 --> 00:29:34,994
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that sounds great.

305
00:29:40,768 --> 00:29:43,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so we have conflicting motions on the floor.

306
00:29:43,869 --> 00:29:46,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there an optional member of Rousseau?

307
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:48,190
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, my hand was up.

308
00:29:50,111 --> 00:29:53,111
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I just wanna add, you know, we're 32 minutes into this.

309
00:29:54,352 --> 00:29:56,952
[SPEAKER_11]: We agreed earlier how we were gonna proceed.

310
00:29:56,972 --> 00:30:02,834
[SPEAKER_11]: I was hoping maybe the members could agree that since we've agreed how we will proceed, that we will proceed the way we agreed.

311
00:30:04,777 --> 00:30:10,160
[SPEAKER_11]: Because this is going to take 12 hours if we continue to discuss whether we should be discussing this.

312
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:19,426
[SPEAKER_11]: And I have to admit, I'm not particularly pleased with the progress we're making, and we aren't talking about the rules.

313
00:30:21,527 --> 00:30:23,248
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to get focused back to the rules.

314
00:30:24,329 --> 00:30:25,930
[SPEAKER_11]: Would you like me to do the roll call on these?

315
00:30:27,771 --> 00:30:29,752
[SPEAKER_02]: We have two conflicting motions on the floor.

316
00:30:31,678 --> 00:30:43,947
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to create a middle ground as an optional meeting with notices from the superintendent and her team throughout the summer as a way to compromise rather than a definite meeting in August.

317
00:30:44,007 --> 00:30:45,308
[SPEAKER_02]: What if we need a meeting in July?

318
00:30:45,928 --> 00:30:55,535
[SPEAKER_02]: An optional meeting in the summer with notices on anything pertinent that the school committee knows from the superintendent and her team throughout the summer.

319
00:30:57,296 --> 00:30:57,997
[SPEAKER_02]: Member McLaughlin.

320
00:31:01,766 --> 00:31:02,188
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

321
00:31:02,288 --> 00:31:03,874
[SPEAKER_13]: I found the policy thing.

322
00:31:03,954 --> 00:31:04,737
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to read it.

323
00:31:04,818 --> 00:31:07,006
[SPEAKER_13]: It's BGB policy adoption.

324
00:31:08,194 --> 00:31:13,017
[SPEAKER_13]: So adoption of new policies or changing existing policy is solely the responsibility of the school committee.

325
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:14,859
[SPEAKER_13]: I can put it in the chat if people want.

326
00:31:14,899 --> 00:31:24,065
[SPEAKER_13]: Policies will be adopted and amended only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the school committee when such action has been scheduled on the agenda of a regular special meeting.

327
00:31:24,105 --> 00:31:32,771
[SPEAKER_13]: So again, to member Graham's point, to permit time for study of all policies or amendments to policies and to provide an opportunity for interested parties to react,

328
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:38,114
[SPEAKER_13]: Proposed policies or amendments will be presented as an agenda item to the committee in the following sequence.

329
00:31:38,314 --> 00:31:40,996
[SPEAKER_13]: One, information item, distribution with agenda.

330
00:31:41,076 --> 00:31:47,901
[SPEAKER_13]: Two, discussion item, first reading of proposed policy or policies, response from superintendent, report from any advisory committee.

331
00:31:47,921 --> 00:31:48,722
[SPEAKER_11]: What information?

332
00:31:50,103 --> 00:31:52,224
[SPEAKER_02]: What information, member Rousseau?

333
00:31:53,125 --> 00:31:56,447
[SPEAKER_11]: Since I don't see the policy myself, I'm just curious how long this is.

334
00:32:00,302 --> 00:32:02,703
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, some of these policies are many pages long.

335
00:32:02,723 --> 00:32:05,043
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why I was like- Yeah, no, no, no.

336
00:32:05,283 --> 00:32:06,304
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not long, but I'm happy.

337
00:32:06,364 --> 00:32:07,604
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm gonna put it in the chat here.

338
00:32:07,984 --> 00:32:09,464
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I think I'm gonna put it in the chat.

339
00:32:10,185 --> 00:32:16,406
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a policy that we're gonna change once we go through these rules anyway, because the rules will supersede.

340
00:32:16,966 --> 00:32:26,169
[SPEAKER_02]: So before we vote on them on the floor on a school committee evening at six, 6.30, we'll have a team to go through and make sure they coincide.

341
00:32:27,017 --> 00:32:38,728
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe we should put that in the chat and then we can move on to, do we want to have it say an optional meeting in the summer with notices from the superintendent or team?

342
00:32:39,048 --> 00:32:40,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Is everybody comfortable with that?

343
00:32:40,689 --> 00:32:43,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the two motions are in conflict.

344
00:32:43,272 --> 00:32:45,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Either we don't have a meeting or we have one.

345
00:32:47,555 --> 00:32:48,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Ruseau?

346
00:32:49,537 --> 00:32:49,838
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

347
00:32:53,584 --> 00:32:58,045
[SPEAKER_11]: We can't be discussing a third option when we have two amendments on the floor.

348
00:32:58,085 --> 00:33:02,307
[SPEAKER_11]: We have to vote the last, the second amendment is the last one we can be discussing.

349
00:33:06,128 --> 00:33:09,329
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it can't go three amendments deep, Mayor, I'm sorry.

350
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:14,490
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we can discuss a middle ground.

351
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:22,033
[SPEAKER_02]: I just need to hear if that's amenable to member Cress who made her motion and member,

352
00:33:23,732 --> 00:33:31,215
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it was, um, uh, yeah.

353
00:33:31,716 --> 00:33:35,897
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, so I I'm, I'm not in favor of having a summer meeting.

354
00:33:35,917 --> 00:33:43,861
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, you know, I still want to keep my motion on the floor to having, um, communication brought, you know, updates.

355
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:51,438
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I think at any point, an emergency meeting can be called, you know, if we had to.

356
00:33:52,379 --> 00:33:55,421
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm still gonna keep my amendment as is.

357
00:33:55,442 --> 00:33:56,262
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

358
00:33:57,283 --> 00:34:07,091
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was amended by Member Kreatz and seconded by Member McLaughlin at the time to have him just strike that line.

359
00:34:07,291 --> 00:34:08,312
[SPEAKER_02]: So roll call.

360
00:34:10,073 --> 00:34:11,995
[SPEAKER_11]: Member, so this is the,

361
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:18,812
[SPEAKER_11]: to strike it or to replace it with a superintendent will send out a broadcast memo to all members each week in August.

362
00:34:19,373 --> 00:34:20,613
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, to amend it.

363
00:34:22,374 --> 00:34:22,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Graham?

364
00:34:23,555 --> 00:34:23,755
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

365
00:34:26,636 --> 00:34:27,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Hays?

366
00:34:27,796 --> 00:34:28,017
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

367
00:34:29,637 --> 00:34:30,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Kreatz?

368
00:34:30,878 --> 00:34:31,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

369
00:34:32,439 --> 00:34:33,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Member McLaughlin?

370
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:35,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

371
00:34:38,321 --> 00:34:38,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Mustone?

372
00:34:39,662 --> 00:34:39,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

373
00:34:41,547 --> 00:34:42,868
[SPEAKER_11]: that number 11 is amended.

374
00:34:42,888 --> 00:34:46,630
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, member is so, um.

375
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:46,690
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

376
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:48,511
[SPEAKER_11]: That mayor.

377
00:34:48,891 --> 00:34:49,111
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay?

378
00:34:50,291 --> 00:34:54,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes for in the affirmative three in the negative.

379
00:34:56,154 --> 00:34:58,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Um that number 11 is amended.

380
00:35:01,757 --> 00:35:02,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Man.

381
00:35:03,118 --> 00:35:03,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Member of

382
00:35:11,812 --> 00:35:17,156
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know procedurally, well, actually there was no second to the as allowed by law.

383
00:35:17,837 --> 00:35:24,622
[SPEAKER_11]: So does the first amendment just die and we don't, I don't know how to dispose of it, that's why.

384
00:35:27,244 --> 00:35:29,586
[SPEAKER_02]: It contradicts it, so I would rule that it died.

385
00:35:30,787 --> 00:35:32,328
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, that's my motion, so I'll just withdraw it.

386
00:35:32,348 --> 00:35:33,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you.

387
00:35:35,991 --> 00:35:36,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Number 12.

388
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:39,347
[SPEAKER_02]: is different than what we do now.

389
00:35:39,507 --> 00:35:44,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually if we have a Monday holiday, we would have a meeting on the following Monday.

390
00:35:44,932 --> 00:35:55,142
[SPEAKER_02]: So this reads that it would be on the Wednesday, which I guess I just want to point out because it's much different than we operate now.

391
00:35:56,963 --> 00:36:00,527
[SPEAKER_02]: But other than that, any other questions on 1 through 20?

392
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:08,753
[SPEAKER_10]: I felt the same way, Mayor, and I actually had the same feedback written down that you just mentioned.

393
00:36:09,653 --> 00:36:12,374
[SPEAKER_10]: So I wanted to hear from the rest of the committee.

394
00:36:17,516 --> 00:36:18,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, Dr. Edward-Vincent?

395
00:36:19,057 --> 00:36:19,777
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

396
00:36:20,738 --> 00:36:30,882
[SPEAKER_08]: Mayor, I would like to say if we have the meeting on a Wednesday and the Monday is a holiday, that means we would have to post the Friday before the Monday.

397
00:36:34,093 --> 00:36:41,236
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, as it is trying to do Thursday for a Monday, there were so many, uh, just the timing with the 48 hours.

398
00:36:42,096 --> 00:36:55,062
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I, I would, you know, kindly request that it could be the following Monday or, um, but the Wednesday after a Monday, it puts us to the Friday before.

399
00:36:55,482 --> 00:36:59,704
[SPEAKER_08]: And, um, I just think it, it, it,

400
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:02,701
[SPEAKER_08]: it could potentially be a problem for us.

401
00:37:03,021 --> 00:37:20,011
[SPEAKER_08]: I prefer knowing that Mondays are exclusively reserved for school committee meetings or other meetings that we have for the most part, because some of our regular meetings can be quite lengthy, and that would be my recommendation.

402
00:37:21,852 --> 00:37:23,993
[SPEAKER_10]: I motion to change it to the following Monday.

403
00:37:24,013 --> 00:37:27,315
[SPEAKER_02]: Second.

404
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:35,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody remember Ruseau and then it's actually I remember pets.

405
00:37:35,683 --> 00:37:36,543
[SPEAKER_02]: That was your comment.

406
00:37:36,583 --> 00:37:38,224
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's actually McLaughlin and Russo.

407
00:37:38,284 --> 00:37:40,405
[SPEAKER_02]: I have the order and I found a way to find the order.

408
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:41,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Member McLaughlin.

409
00:37:44,646 --> 00:37:44,927
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

410
00:37:44,987 --> 00:37:47,227
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, I'm waiting for item 20 before we move on.

411
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:50,709
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just, you had asked if there was any other items on this 10 to 20.

412
00:37:50,789 --> 00:37:51,529
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'll wait.

413
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:51,909
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

414
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:52,790
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

415
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:53,270
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Ruseau.

416
00:37:55,172 --> 00:37:55,512
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

417
00:37:56,073 --> 00:38:02,356
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I ask members to use the exact words that you want added changed the exact words.

418
00:38:03,757 --> 00:38:09,821
[SPEAKER_11]: It feels like members are saying something and then the next time and they repeat it it's different than the third time they repeat it, it's different.

419
00:38:10,661 --> 00:38:19,927
[SPEAKER_11]: The exact words matter, because those have to be words that are written into this document, and I don't want to be accused of making it up off of what I thought you might have meant.

420
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:31,044
[SPEAKER_11]: When we make motions and amendments and resolutions, every word as it is expected to be written has to be precisely given by the members.

421
00:38:31,504 --> 00:38:33,905
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's just a constant problem that we have.

422
00:38:33,945 --> 00:38:39,708
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know that's not on the agenda tonight, but as I try to keep up, I wanna know what words you want.

423
00:38:40,688 --> 00:38:44,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, you would strike the whole second line into the third line.

424
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:50,113
[SPEAKER_02]: So it would read meeting dates that coincide with non-school days according to the approved academic calendar

425
00:38:50,563 --> 00:38:52,265
[SPEAKER_02]: will be moved to the following Monday.

426
00:38:54,887 --> 00:38:56,188
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the rest of it is gone.

427
00:38:57,369 --> 00:38:57,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.

428
00:38:58,670 --> 00:38:59,010
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

429
00:38:59,931 --> 00:39:02,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion on the floor by Member Kreatz, seconded by Member Graham.

430
00:39:02,994 --> 00:39:03,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Roll call, please.

431
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:10,300
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, Member Graham.

432
00:39:10,841 --> 00:39:11,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

433
00:39:12,402 --> 00:39:12,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Hays.

434
00:39:13,703 --> 00:39:13,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

435
00:39:15,164 --> 00:39:15,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Kreatz.

436
00:39:21,127 --> 00:39:21,527
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm correct.

437
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:22,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes.

438
00:39:23,729 --> 00:39:25,450
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you hear me?

439
00:39:25,731 --> 00:39:25,971
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

440
00:39:26,311 --> 00:39:26,971
[SPEAKER_11]: Member McLaughlin?

441
00:39:27,652 --> 00:39:27,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

442
00:39:29,473 --> 00:39:30,094
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Mustone?

443
00:39:30,514 --> 00:39:30,814
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

444
00:39:32,155 --> 00:39:32,796
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Ruseau?

445
00:39:32,856 --> 00:39:33,136
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

446
00:39:34,917 --> 00:39:36,278
[SPEAKER_11]: And Mayor Wangokirik?

447
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:37,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

448
00:39:37,399 --> 00:39:38,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

449
00:39:39,161 --> 00:39:42,143
[SPEAKER_02]: The motion for number 12 has been approved.

450
00:39:48,126 --> 00:39:51,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Number 13, it seems that we already follow that practice.

451
00:39:51,067 --> 00:40:02,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Number 14, I just have a question on what if the admin, somebody was sick or unavailable for important reasons and had to cancel a meeting?

452
00:40:02,991 --> 00:40:07,472
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see it happening often, but I don't wanna, I just wanna point that out.

453
00:40:09,773 --> 00:40:12,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Kreatz and then member Ruseau.

454
00:40:15,411 --> 00:40:20,695
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, um, yeah, so I was, I just want to get back to a kind of loss.

455
00:40:20,776 --> 00:40:21,276
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, here it is.

456
00:40:21,296 --> 00:40:22,157
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

457
00:40:22,357 --> 00:40:22,557
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

458
00:40:22,617 --> 00:40:30,844
[SPEAKER_10]: So when I was reading this rule, I was just thinking back to earlier this month, the January 3 meeting was postponed until the 10th.

459
00:40:31,484 --> 00:40:35,347
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, I just found out, you know, just by getting the,

460
00:40:36,488 --> 00:40:39,651
[SPEAKER_10]: the change date, zoom, um, you know, meeting request.

461
00:40:40,372 --> 00:40:43,595
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, so I I'm not familiar with the current process.

462
00:40:44,216 --> 00:40:45,938
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, you know, how was it handled?

463
00:40:46,458 --> 00:40:46,799
[SPEAKER_10]: So.

464
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:56,428
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I don't think, you know, we've officially had a process to postpone it and it's been at the discretion of the superintendent.

465
00:40:57,610 --> 00:40:57,730
[SPEAKER_10]: Um,

466
00:41:00,686 --> 00:41:03,649
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm wondering if somebody could just maybe help answer that question?

467
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:10,176
[SPEAKER_10]: Because we haven't had a process or a rule on canceling or postponing.

468
00:41:10,216 --> 00:41:14,320
[SPEAKER_10]: It's typically been at the discretion of the superintendent or the mayor.

469
00:41:16,082 --> 00:41:16,702
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Ruseau?

470
00:41:16,822 --> 00:41:17,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, member Gratz.

471
00:41:17,663 --> 00:41:18,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Ruseau?

472
00:41:19,265 --> 00:41:20,546
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I would say

473
00:41:21,949 --> 00:41:28,575
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think there is an answer, but Member Cress, this is the exact reason that I spent all this time writing this document.

474
00:41:28,815 --> 00:41:42,626
[SPEAKER_11]: It's because whether we decide it's at the superintendent's pleasure or whether, you know, whoever's third in the alphabet on the school committee wants to have the authority to cancel meetings, it doesn't matter what the rules are.

475
00:41:42,647 --> 00:41:44,188
[SPEAKER_11]: We just have to agree

476
00:41:45,823 --> 00:41:46,804
[SPEAKER_11]: they are what they are.

477
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:58,073
[SPEAKER_11]: And so that's exactly why this one's here because we had, you know, the January meeting, I mean, there was no written procedure or policy on how or who can do what.

478
00:41:58,553 --> 00:42:00,115
[SPEAKER_11]: And I, you know, it got changed.

479
00:42:00,495 --> 00:42:05,299
[SPEAKER_11]: And I feel like I didn't know about it until, you know, I should have known about it sooner.

480
00:42:05,539 --> 00:42:07,261
[SPEAKER_11]: So, and this is actually a

481
00:42:08,351 --> 00:42:21,420
[SPEAKER_11]: Many of these things for which we don't have a past practice or it's been variable have just been taken from other school committees policy rules, manuals that I've found in Cambridge and Belmont and other towns.

482
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:26,683
[SPEAKER_11]: So that, you know, mostly because I didn't want to write it from scratch if somebody else has already written it.

483
00:42:27,344 --> 00:42:28,745
[SPEAKER_11]: And this one seems to be the norm.

484
00:42:28,825 --> 00:42:36,350
[SPEAKER_11]: I also think that if a meeting is posted, there's something in open meeting law about it, but regardless,

485
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:39,733
[SPEAKER_11]: This was my proposal for number 14.

486
00:42:42,957 --> 00:42:43,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Kreatz?

487
00:42:44,605 --> 00:42:53,071
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, so I was reading ahead and there's another number that connects with this number, I think, number 17.

488
00:42:53,111 --> 00:43:10,865
[SPEAKER_10]: In the event of an emergency due to extraordinary circumstances, the requirement that notification of cancellation is provided in writing may be waived and members may notify the superintendent of their desire to cancel the meeting, email or in person, any verbal requests must be followed with a written request.

489
00:43:12,771 --> 00:43:15,272
[SPEAKER_10]: The two rules are in two different sections.

490
00:43:16,253 --> 00:43:29,639
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it should just be consolidated into one rule, you know, that goes, you know, into both of these situations, because we're talking about canceling a meeting.

491
00:43:29,659 --> 00:43:36,603
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, it should include in the event of an emergency, you know, in a situation like this, you know,

492
00:43:37,862 --> 00:43:43,447
[SPEAKER_10]: It's at the discretion of the superintendent to cancel the meeting by telephone, email, or in person.

493
00:43:44,248 --> 00:43:51,213
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, we did have, you know, if there is a snow storm the day of the meeting, you know, we would have to cancel the meeting.

494
00:43:51,233 --> 00:43:56,818
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, something like that could happen, especially in the winter months.

495
00:44:00,101 --> 00:44:02,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember Rousseau.

496
00:44:03,244 --> 00:44:03,584
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

497
00:44:03,804 --> 00:44:06,006
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I certainly agree that from a.

498
00:44:07,737 --> 00:44:12,220
[SPEAKER_11]: reading perspective, putting them together makes sense, but rules really need to be one thing.

499
00:44:12,481 --> 00:44:20,186
[SPEAKER_11]: One's about when we're having meetings, one's about canceling meetings, another one, this one's about emergencies.

500
00:44:22,908 --> 00:44:30,734
[SPEAKER_11]: And whether it's this whole document, we could just call it the rules document and not put numbers in front of them, even just reference line numbers.

501
00:44:30,774 --> 00:44:33,977
[SPEAKER_11]: And actually some school committees don't use rule numbers, which I think is,

502
00:44:35,453 --> 00:45:02,778
[SPEAKER_11]: weird because then you can't talk about them like you know that rule number 18 that we keep bringing up except instead we say that page 32 subsection 9 but I'm not I'm opposed to combining them because I think that you know if there's an emergency it's easier to find a rule about emergencies than it is to find a rule about cancellations but

503
00:45:03,789 --> 00:45:05,210
[SPEAKER_11]: It's six of one, half of them together.

504
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:06,971
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not gonna die on this hill.

505
00:45:09,874 --> 00:45:10,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Kreatz.

506
00:45:11,635 --> 00:45:16,179
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I'm just trying to think of something I was gonna say.

507
00:45:16,979 --> 00:45:21,983
[SPEAKER_10]: So, cause I know Mr. Russo wants the exact word.

508
00:45:22,003 --> 00:45:23,084
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm trying to think of it.

509
00:45:24,045 --> 00:45:26,727
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm making a motion

510
00:45:27,987 --> 00:45:33,469
[SPEAKER_10]: to amend number 14 to say no meeting.

511
00:45:33,489 --> 00:45:37,671
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, let me just catch my train of thought.

512
00:45:42,853 --> 00:45:55,958
[SPEAKER_10]: The superintendent and or mayor have the discretion to cancel a meeting and notify all committee members via email as soon as possible.

513
00:45:58,703 --> 00:46:00,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion on the floor by Member Kreatz.

514
00:46:03,387 --> 00:46:07,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Seconded by... Second.

515
00:46:07,850 --> 00:46:09,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Member McLaughlin, roll call.

516
00:46:12,154 --> 00:46:12,674
[SPEAKER_11]: I hate that.

517
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:13,875
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, it was in the recording.

518
00:46:13,935 --> 00:46:14,636
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll go back for it.

519
00:46:15,837 --> 00:46:16,377
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Graham.

520
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:19,400
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

521
00:46:21,281 --> 00:46:21,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Hays.

522
00:46:22,783 --> 00:46:23,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

523
00:46:24,964 --> 00:46:25,485
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Kreatz.

524
00:46:26,245 --> 00:46:26,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

525
00:46:30,425 --> 00:46:30,605
Um.

526
00:46:32,006 --> 00:46:32,686
[SPEAKER_11]: Member McLaughlin.

527
00:46:33,567 --> 00:46:33,907
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

528
00:46:35,748 --> 00:46:36,368
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember must own.

529
00:46:36,829 --> 00:46:37,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

530
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:39,170
[SPEAKER_11]: Members.

531
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:40,010
[SPEAKER_11]: So no.

532
00:46:40,971 --> 00:46:41,691
[SPEAKER_11]: Mayor Long occur.

533
00:46:43,152 --> 00:46:43,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

534
00:46:43,492 --> 00:46:43,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Five in the

535
00:46:51,847 --> 00:47:00,113
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, since we have our, uh, uh, attorney fan here, um, I just want to ask him, we should have asked before we voted, but kind of moved into that quickly.

536
00:47:00,694 --> 00:47:09,260
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so the superintendent who is, is allowed to cancel meetings that are posted open meeting while allows not a lot of people to do that.

537
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,902
[SPEAKER_01]: I was raising my hand at the end.

538
00:47:11,922 --> 00:47:13,563
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think, uh,

539
00:47:15,481 --> 00:47:21,888
[SPEAKER_01]: I think canceling a meeting should be something for the committee to decide and not the superintendent.

540
00:47:25,772 --> 00:47:27,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Subcommittee, that's number 15.

541
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:34,961
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the chair.

542
00:47:35,902 --> 00:47:36,242
[SPEAKER_14]: Mayor.

543
00:47:36,883 --> 00:47:37,844
[SPEAKER_14]: Member Graham.

544
00:47:38,993 --> 00:47:39,934
[SPEAKER_14]: I agree with Howard.

545
00:47:39,954 --> 00:47:51,303
[SPEAKER_14]: I also think it's a really slippery slope to give a superintendent, not this one, but a superintendent, the authority to decide that the school committee will not meet.

546
00:47:54,786 --> 00:47:55,066
[SPEAKER_14]: So.

547
00:47:56,608 --> 00:47:57,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Ruseau.

548
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:00,551
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I completely agree with Member Graham.

549
00:48:00,571 --> 00:48:03,533
[SPEAKER_11]: We have already voted to give the superintendent this authority.

550
00:48:06,778 --> 00:48:09,719
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'd rather we not belabor something I disagree with.

551
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,721
[SPEAKER_02]: On to number 15 through 20.

552
00:48:15,241 --> 00:48:22,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any other questions, Member McLaughlin and Member Graham?

553
00:48:25,714 --> 00:48:27,296
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, I'm there.

554
00:48:27,836 --> 00:48:36,144
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I speaking of belaboring I don't want to really belabor the policy thing but I do think that in terms of policy both.

555
00:48:37,465 --> 00:48:38,446
[SPEAKER_13]: What is it both.

556
00:48:41,905 --> 00:48:56,113
[SPEAKER_13]: Hold on, both BGB policy adoption and BGE policy dissemination are, you know, items of discussion now if you know we're looking through the rules right now and we're voting on which rules we are proposing.

557
00:48:56,653 --> 00:49:04,894
[SPEAKER_13]: to change for that to come forward to the school committee as a whole, then I think that's different than accepting the change altogether.

558
00:49:04,934 --> 00:49:22,337
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just want to clarify that that's what we're doing, because otherwise we have to, I think, procedurally, we have to override, someone has to make a motion to override BGB, which is policy adoption, and allow for policy change.

559
00:49:22,397 --> 00:49:25,138
[SPEAKER_13]: So just to clarify, what we're voting on now

560
00:49:26,178 --> 00:49:33,083
[SPEAKER_13]: And these rules are what we're proposing to bring to the committee in a general meeting for passage.

561
00:49:33,223 --> 00:49:33,724
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that right?

562
00:49:35,485 --> 00:49:38,267
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that what everybody's understanding is?

563
00:49:39,868 --> 00:49:40,769
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, no, maybe.

564
00:49:43,911 --> 00:49:46,433
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, that's how all committee work.

565
00:49:46,974 --> 00:49:47,494
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, good.

566
00:49:47,994 --> 00:49:50,476
[SPEAKER_13]: So if that's going to work, it's going to work that way, that'd be great.

567
00:49:50,516 --> 00:49:52,177
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I have a question on item 20.

568
00:49:54,930 --> 00:50:03,735
[SPEAKER_13]: So item 20 was, so the budget meeting will be held in the spring of each year.

569
00:50:04,455 --> 00:50:09,958
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is suggesting that it's one budget meeting and it's gonna be held in the spring of each year.

570
00:50:10,538 --> 00:50:12,579
[SPEAKER_13]: And this was a conversation that we've been having.

571
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:23,104
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I'm not sure if we're talking about all of the needs that are required for our school committee to be able to help run this organization in the way that we need to.

572
00:50:23,224 --> 00:50:24,445
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think one meeting

573
00:50:25,243 --> 00:50:25,884
[SPEAKER_13]: for the budget.

574
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:27,324
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that not what it says?

575
00:50:27,865 --> 00:50:29,125
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's not how I read it.

576
00:50:29,145 --> 00:50:32,807
[SPEAKER_02]: There'll be one joint budget meeting between school committee and city council.

577
00:50:33,068 --> 00:50:34,008
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, well then that works.

578
00:50:34,068 --> 00:50:34,588
[SPEAKER_13]: That's great.

579
00:50:34,628 --> 00:50:36,309
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, good.

580
00:50:36,329 --> 00:50:37,510
[SPEAKER_02]: I just had a question on this.

581
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:43,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I have a question on the same one, just if for some reason, city council is not interested in meeting.

582
00:50:43,633 --> 00:50:47,776
[SPEAKER_02]: That just leaves a lot of pressure on me.

583
00:50:50,293 --> 00:50:57,257
[SPEAKER_13]: And just point of information, can we call that a joint meeting then instead of a budget meeting so that there's no room for misunderstanding?

584
00:50:57,897 --> 00:51:01,039
[SPEAKER_02]: A motion to amend to a joint budget meeting?

585
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:04,221
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, please.

586
00:51:06,562 --> 00:51:13,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to amend number 20 by member McLaughlin to read, the chair will schedule two annual joint meetings with the city council.

587
00:51:13,166 --> 00:51:16,128
[SPEAKER_02]: A joint budget meeting will be held in the spring of each year.

588
00:51:17,969 --> 00:51:18,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Seconded by?

589
00:51:20,455 --> 00:51:22,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Graham, roll call, Member Ruseau.

590
00:51:23,036 --> 00:51:29,680
[SPEAKER_00]: Mayor, could someone, before this rule is adopted, could someone explain what we will be presenting at the budget meeting?

591
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:31,081
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

592
00:51:31,341 --> 00:51:32,201
[SPEAKER_00]: The joint meeting.

593
00:51:33,522 --> 00:51:38,165
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's an opportunity, I'm just unclear exactly what the meeting will be.

594
00:51:38,185 --> 00:51:43,287
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it can even be scheduled, yeah.

595
00:51:43,347 --> 00:51:49,931
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's up to the city council and the school committee, but I just, I would, I suspect that will be,

596
00:51:50,998 --> 00:51:58,163
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible for presenting some information, I would just be very curious as to what, what the committee will be looking for.

597
00:51:58,183 --> 00:52:02,345
[SPEAKER_00]: And the council, I guess for that matter, member requests that member Ruseau.

598
00:52:04,227 --> 00:52:04,507
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

599
00:52:04,707 --> 00:52:08,950
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, I had similar questions, because, you know,

600
00:52:10,228 --> 00:52:18,794
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we first have to, you know, reach out to city council to ask if they are interested in having a joint meeting with us and work out the details.

601
00:52:19,375 --> 00:52:21,116
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, what, what is the meeting about?

602
00:52:21,196 --> 00:52:23,618
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, uh, are we discussing goals?

603
00:52:24,678 --> 00:52:25,879
[SPEAKER_10]: The pre budget goals.

604
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:31,984
[SPEAKER_10]: Are we discussing, you know, the, the budget information that we have?

605
00:52:32,004 --> 00:52:34,545
[SPEAKER_10]: I was, I was just a little bit confused about this.

606
00:52:35,266 --> 00:52:38,148
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, this rule, the way it's presented.

607
00:52:39,722 --> 00:52:41,403
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm unclear about it myself.

608
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:42,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Ruseau.

609
00:52:44,266 --> 00:52:44,647
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

610
00:52:45,428 --> 00:52:45,968
[SPEAKER_11]: It's clear.

611
00:52:46,829 --> 00:52:58,742
[SPEAKER_11]: We are voting already even though nobody asked me what it means there, the chair, remembering that rules are about one thing only the chair will schedule to annual joint meetings with the city council period.

612
00:52:59,933 --> 00:53:02,596
[SPEAKER_11]: One of those meetings will be a spring meeting, the budget meeting.

613
00:53:02,996 --> 00:53:04,358
[SPEAKER_11]: So it will be a joint meeting.

614
00:53:04,378 --> 00:53:06,800
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't have to keep adding the word joint everywhere.

615
00:53:07,001 --> 00:53:11,185
[SPEAKER_11]: The rest of this is about the two annual joint meetings of the city council.

616
00:53:12,146 --> 00:53:15,149
[SPEAKER_11]: So then we will have a spring meeting, which would be a budget with them.

617
00:53:15,389 --> 00:53:21,136
[SPEAKER_11]: And then a more general meeting sometime between October and March, which is on goals and progress.

618
00:53:21,196 --> 00:53:22,277
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the second meeting.

619
00:53:23,763 --> 00:53:24,864
[SPEAKER_11]: There's only two meetings.

620
00:53:25,584 --> 00:53:28,205
[SPEAKER_11]: They're both joint meetings because that's what this rule is about.

621
00:53:29,306 --> 00:53:39,211
[SPEAKER_11]: And certainly if the city council isn't ready or able to actually have such a meeting, then, you know, their rules at present do not actually I forget if this is in there.

622
00:53:39,632 --> 00:53:42,033
[SPEAKER_11]: If there is some rule in there where they have a joint session with us.

623
00:53:42,513 --> 00:53:45,735
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, these are rules, these are.

624
00:53:46,832 --> 00:53:48,092
[SPEAKER_11]: what we want to happen.

625
00:53:48,553 --> 00:54:01,437
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, if the superintendent comes and says, you know, we, we can't find a date this year, or we can't, you know, it says spring, maybe, I mean, it's just nice to imagine that before the summer gets here, we finished with our budget.

626
00:54:01,877 --> 00:54:05,098
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, these are rules.

627
00:54:05,138 --> 00:54:08,599
[SPEAKER_11]: These are not like we're not etching them in concrete on the side of City Hall.

628
00:54:09,859 --> 00:54:11,180
[SPEAKER_11]: If this isn't going to work this year, or

629
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:18,305
[SPEAKER_11]: or whatever, then you know superintendent can simply ask that we suspend rule 20 for this year.

630
00:54:19,066 --> 00:54:19,767
[SPEAKER_11]: That's how it works.

631
00:54:20,047 --> 00:54:20,868
[SPEAKER_11]: City Council does it.

632
00:54:22,069 --> 00:54:29,857
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, they used to do it continuously suspending the rules, all of these things can just be suspended by a majority vote at any moment.

633
00:54:30,859 --> 00:54:33,320
[SPEAKER_11]: and can even be stricken from the rule set.

634
00:54:35,041 --> 00:54:42,064
[SPEAKER_11]: This is just an attempt to get us to have a better relation with city council, which I'm quite aware they actually want to have a better relationship with us.

635
00:54:43,704 --> 00:54:48,906
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is something taken from another school committee's manual that I liked and thought, wow, this is good.

636
00:54:50,207 --> 00:54:55,449
[SPEAKER_11]: But if we don't wanna do it at all, then somebody should just vote to strike it.

637
00:54:56,669 --> 00:54:57,310
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion, sorry.

638
00:54:59,270 --> 00:55:00,011
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Kreatz.

639
00:55:01,207 --> 00:55:18,969
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, yes, I'm member Ruseau, would you be willing to amended to say something like the chair will schedule to optional annual joint meetings with the city council, a budget meeting will be held in the spring of the, you know, of each year.

640
00:55:20,515 --> 00:55:21,175
[SPEAKER_10]: a general meeting.

641
00:55:21,475 --> 00:55:31,820
[SPEAKER_10]: So I guess I'm confused about the general meeting in March on goals, because I'm thinking spring is typically March, April, so.

642
00:55:36,682 --> 00:55:41,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe a middle ground would be one meeting to just have a conversation with the city council.

643
00:55:43,125 --> 00:55:43,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Start there.

644
00:55:44,726 --> 00:55:45,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I think.

645
00:55:46,467 --> 00:55:47,167
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

646
00:55:47,927 --> 00:55:49,308
[SPEAKER_11]: I make a motion to strike rules

647
00:55:50,448 --> 00:55:51,389
[SPEAKER_11]: 20 entirely.

648
00:55:52,930 --> 00:55:55,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, motion to strike rule 20, seconded by?

649
00:55:56,752 --> 00:55:57,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Second.

650
00:55:57,433 --> 00:55:58,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Kreatz, roll call.

651
00:56:00,195 --> 00:56:00,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Graham?

652
00:56:01,275 --> 00:56:01,496
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

653
00:56:01,516 --> 00:56:03,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Hays?

654
00:56:04,337 --> 00:56:04,538
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

655
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:08,140
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Kreatz?

656
00:56:11,102 --> 00:56:11,202
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

657
00:56:14,885 --> 00:56:15,585
[SPEAKER_11]: Member McLaughlin?

658
00:56:16,786 --> 00:56:17,126
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

659
00:56:18,647 --> 00:56:19,287
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Bestone?

660
00:56:19,788 --> 00:56:19,948
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

661
00:56:21,459 --> 00:56:22,400
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Ruseau?

662
00:56:23,841 --> 00:56:24,121
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

663
00:56:25,482 --> 00:56:26,462
[SPEAKER_11]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn?

664
00:56:29,665 --> 00:56:34,248
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that is three in the affirmative, four in the negative.

665
00:56:34,748 --> 00:56:35,469
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion fails.

666
00:56:38,651 --> 00:56:44,395
[SPEAKER_11]: Mayor, I don't have the language for the other motion, the other amendment that was on the floor and I apologize.

667
00:56:44,415 --> 00:56:44,475
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

668
00:56:47,932 --> 00:56:51,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to add the word joint before budget in the second sentence.

669
00:56:51,313 --> 00:56:56,374
[SPEAKER_02]: That's by member McLaughlin.

670
00:56:57,995 --> 00:57:00,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Seconded, I believe we need a second.

671
00:57:03,296 --> 00:57:11,098
[SPEAKER_13]: So that was just to clarify that it's a joint budget meeting so that people aren't confusing it with the other budget meetings that we have.

672
00:57:12,458 --> 00:57:15,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Would the committee be amenable to scheduling

673
00:57:17,244 --> 00:57:26,048
[SPEAKER_02]: one meeting per year to discuss, you know, everything from goals to budget with the city council and start there.

674
00:57:26,088 --> 00:57:27,909
[SPEAKER_02]: We can always change this rule to add more.

675
00:57:27,929 --> 00:57:31,851
[SPEAKER_02]: I just know in the past, it's been pretty difficult for myself.

676
00:57:32,271 --> 00:57:34,452
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna be me, you know, I'm the chair.

677
00:57:34,532 --> 00:57:39,354
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's been difficult to try to do this, although I have asked in the past.

678
00:57:40,715 --> 00:57:44,697
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't wanna feel like a failure if I get, you know, hopefully not now,

679
00:57:46,348 --> 00:57:48,269
[SPEAKER_02]: member crest and member Rousseau.

680
00:57:49,089 --> 00:57:49,369
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

681
00:57:49,709 --> 00:57:51,369
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, I'm amenable to that.

682
00:57:51,669 --> 00:58:04,133
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, I motion to change the word wording to say the chair will schedule one annual joint meeting with the city council and everything else that was previously stated will remain the same.

683
00:58:12,075 --> 00:58:12,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Ruseau.

684
00:58:14,346 --> 00:58:14,866
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mayor.

685
00:58:15,487 --> 00:58:24,111
[SPEAKER_11]: So just making sure I get this right, the chair will schedule one annual meeting, joint meeting with the city council.

686
00:58:26,113 --> 00:58:26,433
[SPEAKER_14]: Period.

687
00:58:27,253 --> 00:58:27,673
[SPEAKER_11]: Period.

688
00:58:27,713 --> 00:58:28,654
[SPEAKER_11]: Get rid of the rest of the rule?

689
00:58:29,074 --> 00:58:29,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

690
00:58:29,755 --> 00:58:29,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

691
00:58:29,955 --> 00:58:30,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

692
00:58:32,356 --> 00:58:35,298
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm perfectly amenable to that.

693
00:58:35,498 --> 00:58:43,202
[SPEAKER_11]: So those two changes, actually just one change, and then the deletion of the rest of that is what I have here.

694
00:58:43,854 --> 00:58:44,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

695
00:58:44,114 --> 00:58:44,675
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll second that.

696
00:58:44,715 --> 00:58:45,375
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll second that.

697
00:58:45,936 --> 00:58:49,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, motion by member Kreatz, seconded by member Rousseau.

698
00:58:49,879 --> 00:58:50,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Roll call, please.

699
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:51,960
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Graham?

700
00:58:52,561 --> 00:58:52,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

701
00:58:53,822 --> 00:58:54,242
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Hays?

702
00:58:54,903 --> 00:58:55,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

703
00:58:56,024 --> 00:58:56,504
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Kreatz?

704
00:58:57,104 --> 00:58:57,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

705
00:58:58,405 --> 00:58:59,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Member McLaughlin?

706
00:59:00,727 --> 00:59:01,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

707
00:59:02,008 --> 00:59:02,589
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Mustone?

708
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:04,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

709
00:59:05,451 --> 00:59:06,011
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Ruseau?

710
00:59:06,452 --> 00:59:06,672
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

711
00:59:06,872 --> 00:59:08,213
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Mayor Long-Legger?

712
00:59:09,154 --> 00:59:09,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

713
00:59:09,454 --> 00:59:10,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

714
00:59:11,015 --> 00:59:11,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

715
00:59:12,773 --> 00:59:18,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any questions through number 30, member Kreatz?

716
00:59:20,178 --> 00:59:27,482
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, so I was reading through, I'm just going all the way to 30, just let's see.

717
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:31,184
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so let me just get back up here.

718
00:59:35,327 --> 00:59:37,909
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just reading my notes that I wrote about one of these.

719
00:59:37,929 --> 00:59:39,089
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm on number 21.

720
00:59:43,339 --> 00:59:53,962
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, in number 21, in number 22, I noticed something, but I wasn't sure why it wasn't in number 21.

721
00:59:54,542 --> 01:00:00,703
[SPEAKER_10]: So in the rule 22, it states the meeting will not be broadcast or recorded.

722
01:00:01,063 --> 01:00:05,685
[SPEAKER_10]: However, being a public meeting, the meeting will allow members of the public to attend.

723
01:00:06,205 --> 01:00:09,345
[SPEAKER_10]: The public will not be offered an opportunity to speak.

724
01:00:10,546 --> 01:00:11,086
[SPEAKER_10]: So that,

725
01:00:12,306 --> 01:00:15,569
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, that was in rule 22, it wasn't in rule 21.

726
01:00:15,609 --> 01:00:17,430
[SPEAKER_10]: So I wasn't sure, you know, the workshop.

727
01:00:25,216 --> 01:00:27,238
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not gonna have the public come in.

728
01:00:28,018 --> 01:00:32,542
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not gonna be broadcasted because we're getting training on something.

729
01:00:32,562 --> 01:00:36,545
[SPEAKER_10]: And what is the difference between that and the retreat?

730
01:00:37,706 --> 01:00:40,268
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I was getting the two, the workshop and the retreat.

731
01:00:40,749 --> 01:00:51,837
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just thinking about when the MASC was here and I think we called it a retreat and Dorothy came in and we didn't invite members of the public to attend.

732
01:00:52,378 --> 01:00:54,340
[SPEAKER_10]: And we had a discussion

733
01:00:55,140 --> 01:00:59,601
[SPEAKER_10]: on our own, where we could talk and, you know, converse, ask questions.

734
01:01:00,861 --> 01:01:03,522
[SPEAKER_10]: We didn't, it wasn't recorded.

735
01:01:04,242 --> 01:01:05,783
[SPEAKER_10]: And we didn't invite members of the public.

736
01:01:06,503 --> 01:01:13,824
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm not sure if how everybody feels about that.

737
01:01:13,844 --> 01:01:15,965
[SPEAKER_10]: If somebody members.

738
01:01:17,765 --> 01:01:18,025
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

739
01:01:18,085 --> 01:01:20,346
[SPEAKER_11]: So there were a number of

740
01:01:21,024 --> 01:01:27,208
[SPEAKER_11]: types of meetings that I'm not a lawyer, so I didn't go reading all of Mass General Law.

741
01:01:27,568 --> 01:01:29,389
[SPEAKER_11]: There were a number of types of meetings.

742
01:01:30,009 --> 01:01:32,651
[SPEAKER_11]: There's the hearing, like we have for the budget every year.

743
01:01:33,091 --> 01:01:37,413
[SPEAKER_11]: There's our regular meetings where we have to vote everything that we actually ever vote in other meetings.

744
01:01:38,174 --> 01:01:41,976
[SPEAKER_11]: And we know executive sessions and special meetings.

745
01:01:42,496 --> 01:01:44,397
[SPEAKER_11]: And these were other types of meetings.

746
01:01:49,085 --> 01:01:52,989
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't do much research into what's the difference between a workshop and a retreat.

747
01:01:53,730 --> 01:01:57,053
[SPEAKER_11]: They, of course, if we are all there, it is in fact a public meeting.

748
01:01:57,153 --> 01:02:08,924
[SPEAKER_11]: So I certainly would think that it would be reasonable to add that, you know, that they will not be broadcast or recorded to add that language from 20 to 21.

749
01:02:09,985 --> 01:02:11,607
[SPEAKER_11]: If that's the motion, I can write that down.

750
01:02:14,122 --> 01:02:23,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Graham has a motion by Member Kreatz and then seconded by second Member Graham.

751
01:02:24,007 --> 01:02:25,568
[SPEAKER_02]: And on that, would you like to speak?

752
01:02:26,308 --> 01:02:30,090
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I also just want to mention that in that session,

753
01:02:31,571 --> 01:02:33,212
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't believe there was a quorum.

754
01:02:33,853 --> 01:02:40,137
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't want people to think we didn't host a meeting of the school committee at that time.

755
01:02:40,397 --> 01:02:41,518
[SPEAKER_14]: That is not what happened.

756
01:02:42,939 --> 01:02:44,560
[SPEAKER_14]: This was before people took office.

757
01:02:45,461 --> 01:02:48,043
[SPEAKER_14]: There were three new members and I believe somebody was absent.

758
01:02:48,103 --> 01:02:54,587
[SPEAKER_14]: So there was no issue with what happened at that meeting.

759
01:02:56,228 --> 01:02:57,189
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember the same.

760
01:02:58,873 --> 01:03:01,334
[SPEAKER_02]: before that motion's called, Attorney Greenspan?

761
01:03:02,815 --> 01:03:03,275
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, ma'am.

762
01:03:03,295 --> 01:03:04,395
[SPEAKER_01]: I just had a suggestion.

763
01:03:05,015 --> 01:03:14,119
[SPEAKER_01]: My suggestion would be to strike 21 and on 22, make it retreats or workshops may be scheduled on an as-needed basis.

764
01:03:14,539 --> 01:03:15,860
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my only suggestion, yeah.

765
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:17,580
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great one.

766
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:22,562
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I motion to accept that friendly suggestion to strike 21 and

767
01:03:25,942 --> 01:03:30,604
[SPEAKER_10]: change, well, combine it and just make it one, you know, one rule.

768
01:03:31,345 --> 01:03:38,969
[SPEAKER_10]: Workshops and or retreats may be scheduled on an as-needed basis and everything else would be the same.

769
01:03:40,369 --> 01:03:41,090
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds great.

770
01:03:42,030 --> 01:03:44,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion changed by member Kreatz, seconded by?

771
01:03:45,232 --> 01:03:45,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Second.

772
01:03:46,212 --> 01:03:47,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Graham, roll call, please.

773
01:03:51,335 --> 01:03:51,555
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

774
01:03:52,355 --> 01:03:53,736
[SPEAKER_11]: One second, sorry, Mayor.

775
01:03:53,776 --> 01:03:54,216
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Graham?

776
01:03:55,237 --> 01:03:55,437
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

777
01:03:56,799 --> 01:03:58,099
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Hays?

778
01:03:58,980 --> 01:03:59,220
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

779
01:04:00,460 --> 01:04:00,940
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Kreatz?

780
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:01,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

781
01:04:03,001 --> 01:04:03,681
[SPEAKER_11]: Member McLaughlin?

782
01:04:04,741 --> 01:04:05,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

783
01:04:06,041 --> 01:04:06,682
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Bustone?

784
01:04:07,142 --> 01:04:07,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

785
01:04:08,522 --> 01:04:09,102
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Ruseau?

786
01:04:09,642 --> 01:04:09,862
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

787
01:04:10,203 --> 01:04:11,763
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Ayer-Lungo-Koehn?

788
01:04:13,023 --> 01:04:13,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

789
01:04:13,283 --> 01:04:14,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

790
01:04:15,304 --> 01:04:16,064
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

791
01:04:16,784 --> 01:04:17,564
[SPEAKER_02]: On to page four.

792
01:04:22,626 --> 01:04:23,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Kreatz?

793
01:04:24,158 --> 01:04:32,542
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, on number 23, I'm just not really sure I follow this rule.

794
01:04:32,742 --> 01:04:50,709
[SPEAKER_10]: It says the chair or vice chair of the school committee will, when needed, have a standing meeting with the superintendent prior to any scheduled meeting, workshop or hearing to collaborate on the agenda, setting and help focus on the agenda and superintendent on the goals of the school committee.

795
01:04:50,729 --> 01:04:51,569
[SPEAKER_10]: So,

796
01:04:54,363 --> 01:05:01,889
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I, we, we haven't been doing something like that, um, where the vice chair has been collaborating.

797
01:05:03,170 --> 01:05:06,432
[SPEAKER_10]: With the superintendent and the mayor about the agenda.

798
01:05:07,573 --> 01:05:16,460
[SPEAKER_10]: So I, I was making a motion to, to, you know, to strike just the word, the vice chair, the chair, or.

799
01:05:19,056 --> 01:05:34,830
[SPEAKER_10]: The chair of the school committee will, when needed, have a standing meeting with the superintendent prior to any scheduled meeting, workshop, or hearing to collaborate on the agenda, setting to help focus both the agenda of the school committee and the superintendent on goals of the school committee.

800
01:05:36,551 --> 01:05:42,316
[SPEAKER_10]: Such standing meetings will be held with agreement between the superintendent and the chair.

801
01:05:43,417 --> 01:05:43,897
[SPEAKER_10]: And the chair.

802
01:05:44,918 --> 01:05:45,859
[SPEAKER_10]: It would also just be me.

803
01:05:47,093 --> 01:05:47,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mayor.

804
01:05:47,493 --> 01:05:49,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion by member Kreatz.

805
01:05:51,194 --> 01:05:53,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, of course, okay.

806
01:05:53,754 --> 01:05:54,334
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Ruseau.

807
01:05:54,354 --> 01:05:55,395
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't hear a second.

808
01:05:55,415 --> 01:05:55,995
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mayor.

809
01:05:56,395 --> 01:05:56,855
[SPEAKER_02]: I second.

810
01:05:57,035 --> 01:05:58,455
[SPEAKER_02]: So Oh, okay.

811
01:05:58,475 --> 01:05:59,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Melanie.

812
01:05:59,876 --> 01:06:02,096
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay Um, one second.

813
01:06:02,376 --> 01:06:06,357
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to write that before I. Um so, um, this

814
01:06:12,594 --> 01:06:14,575
[SPEAKER_11]: meet more than just during our school committee meetings.

815
01:06:15,995 --> 01:06:22,277
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, whether it's, you know, phone call, I mean, I don't know that they have necessarily a standing meeting, maybe they do.

816
01:06:23,378 --> 01:06:26,779
[SPEAKER_11]: But this just makes it so that that's an expectation of the school committee.

817
01:06:26,819 --> 01:06:31,981
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that the mayor and the superintendent, as I've often spoken about how I

818
01:06:33,379 --> 01:06:50,408
[SPEAKER_11]: find that particular relationship to be difficult in that you know the mayor is the mayor but she's also just another member of the school committee so it's, I've often spoke about how important it is that the mayor's role in the school system is that of every other school committee member.

819
01:06:52,029 --> 01:07:10,562
[SPEAKER_11]: I also recognize that when we're having workshops, meetings, et cetera, that scheduling and figuring out the agenda, which is normal for the mayor as the agenda setter in our policies, or it's the standard one, that they meet and they actually talk and this happens.

820
01:07:10,642 --> 01:07:20,928
[SPEAKER_11]: And all this inclusion advice chair here is to say that if the mayor decides that while she meets with the superintendent as needed, that she wants to pass on the authority of,

821
01:07:23,075 --> 01:07:26,198
[SPEAKER_11]: this regular meeting of like, how's the agenda looking?

822
01:07:26,318 --> 01:07:27,359
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it too big?

823
01:07:27,519 --> 01:07:29,221
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what the heck the meeting would look like.

824
01:07:31,122 --> 01:07:34,926
[SPEAKER_11]: But that it doesn't have to be the chair, because the chair is the mayor.

825
01:07:35,386 --> 01:07:40,531
[SPEAKER_11]: If we did not have a mayor who is also the chair of the school committee, I can assure you, I would not have put the words vice chair there.

826
01:07:41,011 --> 01:07:43,393
[SPEAKER_11]: But the mayor is not a part time job.

827
01:07:43,873 --> 01:07:44,374
[SPEAKER_11]: And

828
01:07:45,026 --> 01:07:47,248
[SPEAKER_11]: And honestly, I don't know how she's standing still.

829
01:07:47,308 --> 01:07:59,456
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's why I think it's important to give her the leverage to pass on something which looking at this rule is really just administrative and nothing more.

830
01:07:59,696 --> 01:08:02,978
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would not support that amendment.

831
01:08:09,763 --> 01:08:10,944
[SPEAKER_10]: How do you feel about the,

832
01:08:13,072 --> 01:08:17,315
[SPEAKER_10]: the way it's proposed and superintendent, I would just like to hear from you.

833
01:08:20,718 --> 01:08:22,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Superintendent, do you want to go first?

834
01:08:23,820 --> 01:08:24,861
[SPEAKER_02]: I see both sides.

835
01:08:27,343 --> 01:08:31,786
[SPEAKER_08]: My preference would be to leave the way it is, especially right now.

836
01:08:34,079 --> 01:08:45,326
[SPEAKER_08]: Trying to set up the agenda, the amount of resolutions that come in working with reports reporting sharing that information with you, I just see it as.

837
01:08:48,649 --> 01:09:06,602
[SPEAKER_08]: An additional layer if there's ever a problem in the chairs not available, then automatically the vice chair is in charge and I would always report to the vice chair, I just feel, you know, some of the rules, I understand it's it's important to have things clearly articulated.

838
01:09:07,426 --> 01:09:18,533
[SPEAKER_08]: but there's so much layering that's taking place that I just want to be transparent with the committee that this is very stressful.

839
01:09:19,473 --> 01:09:23,936
[SPEAKER_08]: And for number 23, I would prefer for it to remain with the chair.

840
01:09:24,637 --> 01:09:31,001
[SPEAKER_08]: And if the chair is unable to do it, then she can say, I'm not able to meet and delegate it to the vice chair.

841
01:09:31,121 --> 01:09:34,703
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would gladly work with the vice chair.

842
01:09:36,823 --> 01:09:47,334
[SPEAKER_02]: We could even write it that way, as a middle ground, the chair, or if not available, who designates it to the vice chair, will, when needed, have a standing meeting.

843
01:09:51,438 --> 01:09:54,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Ruseau, and then Memocrats, if your hand's still up.

844
01:09:58,445 --> 01:10:00,167
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of speechless, I'll take my hand down.

845
01:10:02,745 --> 01:10:07,069
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, so I have a motion on the floor.

846
01:10:07,089 --> 01:10:18,199
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to amend it to say the chair of the school committee, and when unavailable, will delegate.

847
01:10:18,219 --> 01:10:21,301
[SPEAKER_02]: To the vice chair.

848
01:10:21,582 --> 01:10:28,267
[SPEAKER_10]: To the vice chair, when needed, have a standing meeting and continue, everything else is gonna be the same.

849
01:10:29,122 --> 01:10:43,324
[SPEAKER_10]: And at the end, the last sentence will say, such standing meetings will be held by agreement between the superintendent and the chair or vice chair if delegated.

850
01:10:43,344 --> 01:10:48,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, motion on the floor.

851
01:10:48,405 --> 01:10:49,486
[SPEAKER_02]: I can.

852
01:10:50,606 --> 01:10:51,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Ruseau.

853
01:10:53,366 --> 01:10:57,847
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to remind everybody that the chair can always delegate

854
01:10:58,385 --> 01:11:00,827
[SPEAKER_11]: anything other than what's legally not allowed to be delegated.

855
01:11:03,931 --> 01:11:11,997
[SPEAKER_11]: It feels a bit like this is not, I don't honestly feel like people are being honest about why we're talking about this particular piece in here.

856
01:11:12,537 --> 01:11:15,719
[SPEAKER_11]: It does not make any sense unless there's a problem with who the vice chair is.

857
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:21,523
[SPEAKER_11]: And this seems a bit absurd and we are on page number 23.

858
01:11:22,204 --> 01:11:25,426
[SPEAKER_11]: We have 47 minutes left before we decide whether to accept the whole thing.

859
01:11:26,687 --> 01:11:30,670
[SPEAKER_11]: Are we gonna really discuss things that don't matter endlessly?

860
01:11:32,733 --> 01:11:33,813
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just call the roll.

861
01:11:37,754 --> 01:11:38,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Graham?

862
01:11:38,875 --> 01:11:39,075
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

863
01:11:40,415 --> 01:11:40,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Hays?

864
01:11:41,735 --> 01:11:41,935
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

865
01:11:43,296 --> 01:11:43,836
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Kreatz?

866
01:11:44,576 --> 01:11:44,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

867
01:11:46,516 --> 01:11:47,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Member McLaughlin?

868
01:11:48,097 --> 01:11:48,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

869
01:11:49,497 --> 01:11:50,117
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Bestone?

870
01:11:50,657 --> 01:11:50,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

871
01:11:52,278 --> 01:11:54,658
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Ruseau?

872
01:11:54,878 --> 01:11:55,038
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

873
01:11:56,379 --> 01:11:57,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Mayor Longo Kirk?

874
01:12:01,627 --> 01:12:01,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

875
01:12:03,829 --> 01:12:04,870
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that was a 4-3.

876
01:12:06,431 --> 01:12:06,751
[SPEAKER_11]: Correct.

877
01:12:08,513 --> 01:12:13,037
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm going to need member Kreatz to send the exact language because I couldn't keep up.

878
01:12:14,058 --> 01:12:16,119
[SPEAKER_13]: Can I make a point of information to the chair?

879
01:12:17,801 --> 01:12:18,481
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, ma'am.

880
01:12:18,721 --> 01:12:20,103
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to get it ready right now.

881
01:12:21,374 --> 01:12:26,558
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to make it really clear through the chair that this is not a reflection of who the vice chair is.

882
01:12:26,598 --> 01:12:30,561
[SPEAKER_13]: The vice chair does an extraordinary job and as all our colleagues do.

883
01:12:30,701 --> 01:12:35,565
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I'd really like to focus on teamwork and really collaborating with each other.

884
01:12:36,245 --> 01:12:45,592
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that this is more a function of the way that the current system works and has worked and also a reflection of the superintendent statement.

885
01:12:45,692 --> 01:12:47,594
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just want to make sure that's on the record.

886
01:12:47,634 --> 01:12:47,954
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

887
01:12:55,287 --> 01:13:10,919
[SPEAKER_08]: And Mayor I to want to just piggyback on what member McLaughlin said it has nothing to do with the vice chair, but the amount of layering and it's it's borderline extreme micromanagement.

888
01:13:11,639 --> 01:13:13,199
[SPEAKER_08]: it is very stressful.

889
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:16,620
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm just being fully transparent with the committee right now.

890
01:13:19,281 --> 01:13:36,046
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, going through all of the rules and just thinking about all of the rules that we are trying to follow to run the district, that all of this layering is, I just feel like a lot of it is not necessary.

891
01:13:37,538 --> 01:13:43,500
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just want to be clear with the committee that that's how I feel as superintendent of schools.

892
01:13:44,460 --> 01:13:46,661
[SPEAKER_08]: And I want you to know what I'm thinking.

893
01:13:47,881 --> 01:13:49,902
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to work as hard as I can.

894
01:13:49,922 --> 01:13:52,603
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to do the best that I can do.

895
01:13:52,923 --> 01:14:04,967
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know when it comes time for the evaluation, which is part of the school committee's responsibility to supervise and evaluate the superintendent, if I'm not working to standard, then

896
01:14:05,700 --> 01:14:07,561
[SPEAKER_08]: you'll communicate that effectively to me.

897
01:14:08,322 --> 01:14:12,865
[SPEAKER_08]: But some of this is just really, really too much.

898
01:14:13,345 --> 01:14:21,730
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know I'm not a voting member, but I just want you to be aware that this is a very stressful undertaking right now.

899
01:14:25,553 --> 01:14:25,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

900
01:14:26,733 --> 01:14:28,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any more questions?

901
01:14:28,054 --> 01:14:30,616
[SPEAKER_02]: We're moving on to page four.

902
01:14:30,716 --> 01:14:32,317
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any questions on page four?

903
01:14:37,165 --> 01:14:39,747
[SPEAKER_13]: Mayor, can you give us a minute before we move on, please?

904
01:14:42,769 --> 01:14:43,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

905
01:14:56,099 --> 01:14:58,781
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, Mayor, can I ask specifically what numbers you're talking about?

906
01:14:58,862 --> 01:15:02,504
[SPEAKER_13]: Because some of the paginations changed, so sorry.

907
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:04,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yep.

908
01:15:04,766 --> 01:15:06,027
[SPEAKER_02]: 20, I think we're moving on to 20.

909
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:09,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Page 425 through 34.

910
01:15:19,634 --> 01:15:21,356
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one page I didn't have any questions on either.

911
01:15:21,436 --> 01:15:27,002
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we don't have any, please feel free to move on to page five, which would be rules 35 through 41.

912
01:15:46,056 --> 01:15:49,800
[SPEAKER_13]: May I make a friendly amendment to number 38?

913
01:15:49,860 --> 01:15:53,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, we're in 38.

914
01:15:54,005 --> 01:15:55,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, member McLaughlin.

915
01:15:57,048 --> 01:16:02,775
[SPEAKER_13]: 38, it says at the first meeting, each month of the school committee will have the good of the order following the consent agenda item.

916
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:09,003
[SPEAKER_13]: The purpose of the item is to allow members an opportunity to speak about the functioning of the school committee with the intent of continuous improvement.

917
01:16:09,523 --> 01:16:24,631
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd like to ask if we could add to that or whether the committee thinks it needs to be a separate role or maybe it doesn't because it's already in the policy I don't know, but also under the good of the order we're supposed to be creating objectives and self evaluations.

918
01:16:25,671 --> 01:16:28,653
[SPEAKER_13]: much like the superintendent does at the beginning of the year.

919
01:16:28,733 --> 01:16:41,262
[SPEAKER_13]: So that according to policy, we're supposed to be identifying school committee objectives for the year and then evaluating how we're working together on those specific objectives.

920
01:16:41,902 --> 01:16:43,323
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, that's part of our policy.

921
01:16:43,543 --> 01:16:49,667
[SPEAKER_13]: So I don't know if we need to add it to this, but I think it does fall under good of the order.

922
01:16:49,788 --> 01:16:54,511
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's not just that the purpose to allow members an opportunity to speak about the functioning,

923
01:16:55,291 --> 01:16:59,974
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, um, maybe it's something like at the first of the year or the second good of the order.

924
01:17:00,054 --> 01:17:08,620
[SPEAKER_13]: We identify our objectives and you know, at the whatever, you know, May of the year or something, we do a review or something to that effect.

925
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:11,542
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, I just putting that out there.

926
01:17:12,363 --> 01:17:12,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

927
01:17:12,663 --> 01:17:13,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Member McLaughlin.

928
01:17:13,384 --> 01:17:13,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Ruseau.

929
01:17:15,592 --> 01:17:31,917
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, thank you I agree we need more rules actually than this I have five or six queued up that I thought were too much to add here, things that you know like a rule on how method public members school committee for instance formats resolutions.

930
01:17:33,257 --> 01:17:40,882
[SPEAKER_11]: there's a couple competing ones in the country, and it would be nice if we all did it the same way so that there was some uniformity.

931
01:17:40,942 --> 01:17:50,388
[SPEAKER_11]: But I didn't include that here, and I would expect and hope other members will offer new rules when they feel the urge to.

932
01:17:52,690 --> 01:18:00,255
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm making a motion to add objectives and evaluation for the school committee to the good of the order item.

933
01:18:03,666 --> 01:18:05,127
[SPEAKER_03]: So how do you want that exactly worded?

934
01:18:05,147 --> 01:18:09,891
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me see.

935
01:18:10,112 --> 01:18:13,054
[SPEAKER_13]: I just moved over.

936
01:18:15,096 --> 01:18:18,199
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll include a good of the order following the consent agenda item.

937
01:18:18,699 --> 01:18:28,287
[SPEAKER_13]: Purpose of this item is to allow members an opportunity to speak about the functioning of the school committee with the intent of continuous improvement, maybe related to policy number.

938
01:18:28,307 --> 01:18:29,949
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll get the policy number.

939
01:18:32,299 --> 01:18:34,481
[SPEAKER_13]: and connected to objectives and evaluation.

940
01:18:34,722 --> 01:18:40,929
[SPEAKER_13]: So related to policy number for school committee objectives and evaluation, and I'll get the specific policy number.

941
01:18:40,949 --> 01:18:44,794
[SPEAKER_11]: Could that be repeated again?

942
01:18:45,919 --> 01:18:55,926
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, so it's as is with the intent of continuous improvement as related to policy.

943
01:18:55,946 --> 01:19:03,052
[SPEAKER_13]: I have to look up the policy specifically for school committee objective and evaluation.

944
01:19:04,132 --> 01:19:07,255
[SPEAKER_13]: Objectives and evaluations or evaluation.

945
01:19:08,055 --> 01:19:10,457
[SPEAKER_13]: So objectives, plural, evaluation, singular.

946
01:19:13,059 --> 01:19:13,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

947
01:19:16,269 --> 01:19:19,711
[SPEAKER_02]: If you finish, we'll go off and please, and then Member Kreatz has a question.

948
01:19:20,052 --> 01:19:38,904
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I was just saying that essentially the good of the order is, you know, that we do a review monthly, but that the review is also, or, you know, we have a sort of discussion around continuous improvement of the team, but essentially that it's connected to our identified objectives and evaluation that is in the policy of which the policy number I'll get you.

949
01:19:41,226 --> 01:19:41,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Kreatz?

950
01:19:48,152 --> 01:19:48,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Kretsch, you're muted.

951
01:19:48,933 --> 01:19:53,657
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Kretsch, you're muted.

952
01:19:53,677 --> 01:20:04,325
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, I was emailing Mr. Russo at the same time, and I missed what number we're talking about right now?

953
01:20:04,345 --> 01:20:09,249
[SPEAKER_02]: Number 38, where it mentions the good of the order.

954
01:20:09,490 --> 01:20:14,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Member McLaughlin has made a motion to include the addition of- I have it right here, Mayor.

955
01:20:16,258 --> 01:20:19,641
[SPEAKER_11]: uh, as related to policy for school committee evaluation and objectives.

956
01:20:24,164 --> 01:20:25,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Objectives and evaluations.

957
01:20:26,026 --> 01:20:26,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

958
01:20:30,970 --> 01:20:31,971
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a question about that.

959
01:20:32,091 --> 01:20:40,097
[SPEAKER_10]: So are we gonna, does this mean the school committee we're going to evaluate each other's performance?

960
01:20:42,119 --> 01:20:42,579
[SPEAKER_10]: May I know?

961
01:20:43,206 --> 01:20:43,406
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

962
01:20:43,446 --> 01:20:44,167
[SPEAKER_13]: Member McLaughlin.

963
01:20:44,547 --> 01:20:47,869
[SPEAKER_13]: This is an existing policy that's actually never been implemented.

964
01:20:47,969 --> 01:21:06,719
[SPEAKER_13]: So of which unfortunately we have several, but the policy is, is something that Robert's rules also recommends, but essentially that school committee, you know, does identify objectives and has an evaluation of, I think, actually, let me double check whether it's policy, maybe it's Robert's rules of order.

965
01:21:06,799 --> 01:21:08,400
[SPEAKER_13]: So I should double check.

966
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:11,381
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll back up on that and bring it up at the committee meeting if we need to.

967
01:21:11,441 --> 01:21:11,882
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'll,

968
01:21:13,018 --> 01:21:13,699
[SPEAKER_13]: remove the motion.

969
01:21:13,839 --> 01:21:14,159
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

970
01:21:14,179 --> 01:21:15,040
[SPEAKER_13]: We're sending the motion.

971
01:21:16,561 --> 01:21:19,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, we're sending that motion.

972
01:21:22,307 --> 01:21:28,233
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if there's no other questions on page five, page six is rule 42 to 48.

973
01:21:41,584 --> 01:21:48,267
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just had a question on number 43, where it says the agenda should be posted with the city clerk on Wednesday.

974
01:21:48,287 --> 01:21:50,088
[SPEAKER_02]: That's 72 hours.

975
01:21:50,148 --> 01:21:57,111
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just feel like the agenda is always created on Thursday and gives the superintendent and our team an extra day.

976
01:21:57,211 --> 01:22:08,296
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know how the superintendent feels about that, but we follow the 48 hour rule, at least allow additional resolutions to come in.

977
01:22:09,738 --> 01:22:14,159
[SPEAKER_02]: collect them from when they came in on Tuesday and get it approved by the chair.

978
01:22:14,319 --> 01:22:18,641
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think that might make things flow a little easier than they actually are even now.

979
01:22:19,821 --> 01:22:21,081
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Kreatz and member Ruseau.

980
01:22:22,282 --> 01:22:24,923
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I actually had that written down.

981
01:22:24,943 --> 01:22:32,405
[SPEAKER_10]: I was gonna make a motion that we, and I know Mr. Russo wants the exact wording, so I'm just gonna read what it says right here.

982
01:22:37,512 --> 01:22:51,124
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so agenda for all regular meetings by the school committee will be available to the public and press copies of the agenda will be filed with the office and clerk and posted on the website of the school committee, no later than Thursday.

983
01:22:52,025 --> 01:22:53,306
[SPEAKER_10]: Prior to the meeting.

984
01:22:53,326 --> 01:22:56,529
[SPEAKER_10]: Prior to the scheduled meeting.

985
01:22:57,699 --> 01:23:01,680
[SPEAKER_10]: copies of the agenda will be made available at the Medford Public Library.

986
01:23:02,460 --> 01:23:04,561
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that something that we currently do?

987
01:23:05,621 --> 01:23:07,782
[SPEAKER_10]: Copies at the Medford Public Library?

988
01:23:10,843 --> 01:23:11,023
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

989
01:23:11,843 --> 01:23:12,063
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

990
01:23:12,503 --> 01:23:15,864
[SPEAKER_10]: So I wanna strike that sentence.

991
01:23:17,545 --> 01:23:18,865
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so copies made available.

992
01:23:19,725 --> 01:23:22,606
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so let me just go back one.

993
01:23:22,646 --> 01:23:26,147
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm gonna delete that sentence.

994
01:23:28,490 --> 01:23:33,311
[SPEAKER_10]: just as you just deleted copies of the agenda will be posted on line.

995
01:23:33,331 --> 01:23:37,512
[SPEAKER_10]: Because that is what we do.

996
01:23:37,652 --> 01:23:42,652
[SPEAKER_10]: We post the agenda online, and it's it's broadcasting of information.

997
01:23:43,253 --> 01:23:57,275
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, we have information member so effort is it I'm asking the mayor, I believe she knows that Medford is not a online posting city that is a specific designation that we have to do with the Secretary of State correct.

998
01:23:58,599 --> 01:23:59,059
[SPEAKER_02]: That's correct.

999
01:23:59,099 --> 01:24:01,701
[SPEAKER_02]: We always post in the city clerk's office.

1000
01:24:01,841 --> 01:24:07,124
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be posted on his wall, but we also include it in our city calendar.

1001
01:24:07,184 --> 01:24:12,827
[SPEAKER_02]: We try to include at least the link and the date and the time as advanced as we can.

1002
01:24:12,847 --> 01:24:18,791
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we also try to post it on the school website calendar.

1003
01:24:23,073 --> 01:24:26,635
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if you post it on any wall in the school department.

1004
01:24:26,655 --> 01:24:27,696
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not aware of that.

1005
01:24:29,478 --> 01:24:35,040
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I know before they used to put it in one of the hallways, but right now everything goes online.

1006
01:24:35,380 --> 01:24:41,882
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, we could go back to posting it in the, um, corridor, uh, the superintendent's corridor.

1007
01:24:43,503 --> 01:24:45,324
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a bulletin board area there.

1008
01:24:47,124 --> 01:24:49,265
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but we've been using the online platform.

1009
01:24:50,836 --> 01:25:07,944
[SPEAKER_08]: And in regards to the day, I know that the clerk's office would probably be very happy if we were getting the agenda completed an extra day early, but normally with everything coming in, we actually do need the time to get it done.

1010
01:25:08,345 --> 01:25:10,486
[SPEAKER_08]: And we have to get it to the clerk's office.

1011
01:25:11,766 --> 01:25:13,067
[SPEAKER_08]: We're trying to get it to him by 4.30.

1012
01:25:13,167 --> 01:25:17,249
[SPEAKER_08]: So five o'clock gives us that 30 minute buffer.

1013
01:25:19,266 --> 01:25:21,188
[SPEAKER_02]: and City Hall closes at 4.30 too.

1014
01:25:21,308 --> 01:25:27,335
[SPEAKER_02]: So he is here late sometimes, but on Thursdays, we probably should change it to 4.30 just to be safe.

1015
01:25:28,196 --> 01:25:28,436
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1016
01:25:28,977 --> 01:25:29,177
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1017
01:25:30,718 --> 01:25:32,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Member McLaughlin and member Hays.

1018
01:25:38,006 --> 01:25:38,907
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, may I pass?

1019
01:25:39,988 --> 01:25:40,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Hays.

1020
01:25:43,232 --> 01:26:02,010
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just wondering why we wouldn't want to post it in as many places as possible, unless it's just really too difficult to get it to the library, now that we've got a wonderful new community library that everyone, a lot of people are going to, why wouldn't we take the advantage of having a place where other people might see it who might not necessarily access it online?

1021
01:26:07,318 --> 01:26:13,221
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that it would be great to, it's just another probably step for the school administration to do.

1022
01:26:13,561 --> 01:26:23,687
[SPEAKER_02]: We could always request that the library post, maybe even our scheduled meetings, because we create that far before September.

1023
01:26:24,107 --> 01:26:30,370
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe they can post when our regularly scheduled meetings are, the twice a month calendar, and then it just remain up there.

1024
01:26:30,390 --> 01:26:34,152
[SPEAKER_02]: I can ask Director Kerr to do that, no problem.

1025
01:26:35,984 --> 01:26:46,037
[SPEAKER_02]: but where we're having multiple meetings a week, it might, to put it in a rule and then by accident not get one over there, you'd be posting one almost every other day.

1026
01:26:51,684 --> 01:26:52,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Member McLaughlin.

1027
01:26:54,994 --> 01:26:55,714
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mayor.

1028
01:26:56,614 --> 01:27:08,638
[SPEAKER_13]: Just going back to the good of the order item, and maybe it's a separate rule, I don't know, but it is in our policy that we have operational goals and objectives and an evaluation procedure for the school committee.

1029
01:27:08,658 --> 01:27:10,738
[SPEAKER_13]: It's BA and BAA.

1030
01:27:11,399 --> 01:27:15,380
[SPEAKER_13]: And so maybe in the rules, we have something that says when we schedule that.

1031
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:23,902
[SPEAKER_13]: So I don't know how people feel about that, but we're supposed to be doing operational goals according to policy and evaluating

1032
01:27:24,525 --> 01:27:25,306
[SPEAKER_13]: our procedures.

1033
01:27:27,307 --> 01:27:31,250
[SPEAKER_13]: And if we're scheduling the other items, it feels like we should schedule that while we're here.

1034
01:27:32,591 --> 01:27:44,059
[SPEAKER_13]: So I guess I'm making a motion to include a rule that schedules the school committee operational goals and objectives and evaluation procedures pursuant to policy B.A.

1035
01:27:44,179 --> 01:27:44,680
[SPEAKER_13]: and B.A.A.

1036
01:27:52,103 --> 01:27:59,025
[SPEAKER_11]: For you to remember, McLaughlin, I will need the new rule written out so I can read it and type it in.

1037
01:28:00,325 --> 01:28:12,369
[SPEAKER_11]: And we should talk about numbering of rules when we get to the end, because we've added and removed some, but I'll need that in order to call a roll call on that.

1038
01:28:14,149 --> 01:28:16,990
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, I'm putting it in the chat, but I didn't get a second on the motion.

1039
01:28:20,310 --> 01:28:23,652
[SPEAKER_02]: So the motion is- Maybe you could draft the language in the chat.

1040
01:28:23,692 --> 01:28:25,453
[SPEAKER_02]: We can digest it for a few minutes.

1041
01:28:25,693 --> 01:28:30,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Any new rules we can vote on at the end, assuming we get to the end by six.

1042
01:28:31,156 --> 01:28:31,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds good, thank you.

1043
01:28:32,296 --> 01:28:33,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Edward-Vincent?

1044
01:28:33,817 --> 01:28:42,662
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I had one clarifying question on rule number 42, which talked about numbering,

1045
01:28:45,141 --> 01:28:49,225
[SPEAKER_08]: 2020, well, 2022-124.

1046
01:28:51,147 --> 01:29:03,980
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that saying once we do report of committees, report of the superintendent, and we get to the resolutions, we would no longer be doing one, two, three, four, five.

1047
01:29:04,260 --> 01:29:04,841
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be 124, 125, 126, 127, 128.

1048
01:29:10,001 --> 01:29:13,542
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so the number would change as you go through the entire document.

1049
01:29:13,562 --> 01:29:16,523
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm, I'm just asking for clarification on that piece.

1050
01:29:19,964 --> 01:29:20,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Ruseau.

1051
01:29:21,284 --> 01:29:21,624
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1052
01:29:22,064 --> 01:29:33,428
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so this is only for new, this is actually, um, number 42 is a, um, we actually just passed the new rule on this.

1053
01:29:33,448 --> 01:29:33,488
[SPEAKER_11]: Um,

1054
01:29:35,515 --> 01:29:38,196
[SPEAKER_11]: last meeting on the numbering of items.

1055
01:29:39,496 --> 01:29:55,162
[SPEAKER_11]: And so, and the, just for some context, the sort of the template on how I drafted this in our last meeting, which we did pass, is just to follow the city council's rule.

1056
01:29:55,622 --> 01:29:57,323
[SPEAKER_11]: On January 1st, the year changes.

1057
01:29:58,503 --> 01:30:10,027
[SPEAKER_11]: And as items are submitted to the city clerk, which in our cases, as items are submitted to the superintendent, they just get the next number and the numbers just go up from there.

1058
01:30:10,267 --> 01:30:14,928
[SPEAKER_11]: And then on the next year, 2021, it becomes the first one to coming in is number one.

1059
01:30:15,628 --> 01:30:26,752
[SPEAKER_11]: And yeah, this will give us so many ability, so much ability to keep track of what's where, which is just impossible to do now because it's like, you know,

1060
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:34,282
[SPEAKER_11]: The January 7 agenda item number 400 new business, where is that like, just give them a number.

1061
01:30:34,883 --> 01:30:36,063
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's their number.

1062
01:30:37,523 --> 01:30:42,405
[SPEAKER_11]: We will probably have to discuss the city council has rules on how to dispose of all items.

1063
01:30:42,885 --> 01:30:45,006
[SPEAKER_11]: So, and something gets a number.

1064
01:30:45,906 --> 01:30:50,508
[SPEAKER_11]: And there has to be a term in it terminus to this it has to be, you know,

1065
01:30:51,590 --> 01:31:03,500
[SPEAKER_11]: resolved, performed, responded to all kinds of, we don't have any of those, that level of detail, but I think this is in much greater detail in the thing that we passed last meeting.

1066
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:12,367
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're good with 42 and we're just gonna

1067
01:31:15,683 --> 01:31:21,246
[SPEAKER_02]: make an amendment to 43 to change Wednesday to Thursday and 530 to 430.

1068
01:31:21,546 --> 01:31:24,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a motion on the, motion on the floor?

1069
01:31:25,528 --> 01:31:28,350
[SPEAKER_11]: There was also Metro Public Library to be removed.

1070
01:31:28,370 --> 01:31:32,112
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, right, that was gonna get removed, yes, yep.

1071
01:31:33,352 --> 01:31:34,073
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll second this.

1072
01:31:35,353 --> 01:31:41,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and I will see if the director of the library on the side will put up

1073
01:31:43,859 --> 01:31:45,600

1115
01:32:55,850 --> 01:33:03,637

1116
01:33:03,657 --> 01:33:06,480
[SPEAKER_10]: It was in the 40s, I'm getting there now.

1117
01:33:08,061 --> 01:33:09,481
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, it was number 40.

1118
01:33:11,282 --> 01:33:29,067
[SPEAKER_10]: The agenda will include a listing of all recommendations being brought forward such as listing with a formatted format in accordance with the be dB agenda creation and format regular meetings the agenda will also include a listing of all motions reports and other communications and reports to the school committee.

1119
01:33:29,947 --> 01:33:35,608
[SPEAKER_10]: So that is currently what we're doing, but it doesn't right now.

1120
01:33:36,148 --> 01:33:44,630
[SPEAKER_10]: The agenda does not contain a listing of all the motions that we've taken at meetings.

1121
01:33:45,551 --> 01:33:51,392
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm just motioning to remove that word

1122
01:33:52,546 --> 01:33:56,347
[SPEAKER_10]: because right now the agenda doesn't list all the motions.

1123
01:33:56,887 --> 01:34:00,588
[SPEAKER_02]: This means the motions, the resolutions.

1124
01:34:01,889 --> 01:34:02,069
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh.

1125
01:34:02,409 --> 01:34:06,390
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so motion to change the word to resolutions.

1126
01:34:07,751 --> 01:34:15,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so the number 40, the second line, it would be the agenda will include a listing of all resolutions, reports, and other communications.

1127
01:34:15,993 --> 01:34:19,054
[SPEAKER_02]: A motion on the floor by Member Kreatz, seconded by...

01:34:44,195 --> 01:34:44,896
[SPEAKER_11]: Mayor Long-Leclerc?

1143
01:34:45,436 --> 01:34:48,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I'm the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

1144
01:34:48,037 --> 01:34:52,999
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't myself have any questions up until page

1145
01:34:55,576 --> 01:34:59,559
[SPEAKER_02]: 12 or so, so if we can continue moving through.

1146
01:34:59,980 --> 01:35:01,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Member McLaughlin?

1147
01:35:03,082 --> 01:35:03,642
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1148
01:35:03,702 --> 01:35:06,624
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a question on 67.

1149
01:35:07,785 --> 01:35:12,068
[SPEAKER_13]: If anyone, if folks are okay from where we left off to 67.

1150
01:35:13,449 --> 01:35:16,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Member, yep, we have two more hands coming up.

1151
01:35:17,052 --> 01:35:17,312
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

1152
01:35:18,113 --> 01:35:20,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Is anybody else having before 67?

1153
01:35:20,475 --> 01:35:21,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I do.

1154
01:35:21,876 --> 01:35:23,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, member Kreatzmann, member Hays.

1155
01:35:24,042 --> 01:35:29,507
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, okay, sorry, because when I minimize and maximize, I get back, sorry, I'm going there now.

1156
01:35:29,527 --> 01:35:39,475
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so number 52, I am not in favor of the way that this is, the way that the rule is written.

1157
01:35:39,495 --> 01:35:49,884
[SPEAKER_10]: The rule states public comment will be limited to three minutes per individual and will be limited to those matters on the agenda that I'm fine with.

1158
01:35:50,959 --> 01:36:00,507
[SPEAKER_10]: Members of the public wishing to speak must register their intent prior to the meeting on a form provided for said purpose by the superintendent.

1159
01:36:01,308 --> 01:36:04,110
[SPEAKER_10]: That I would like to remove that sentence.

1160
01:36:05,892 --> 01:36:08,094
[SPEAKER_10]: The chair may limit the comment to two minutes.

1161
01:36:08,174 --> 01:36:14,159
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm fine with that on the number of individuals signed up to speak, but okay.

1162
01:36:14,179 --> 01:36:18,403
[SPEAKER_10]: So the chair may limit the comments

1163
01:36:19,551 --> 01:36:23,454
[SPEAKER_10]: for public participation to two minutes as needed.

1164
01:36:23,474 --> 01:36:30,841
[SPEAKER_10]: And if it was a busy night, the chair will announce the time limit prior to public comment.

1165
01:36:31,241 --> 01:36:41,189
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, at every regular meeting, the public will also be encouraged to submit their comments in writing via email or by emailing the superintendent that we're currently doing.

1166
01:36:41,430 --> 01:36:43,451
[SPEAKER_10]: Written comments will be forwarded to all members.

1167
01:36:44,452 --> 01:36:48,814
[SPEAKER_10]: That is what Mr. Russo is doing currently right now with the auto forward.

1168
01:36:49,675 --> 01:37:06,923
[SPEAKER_10]: And we had discussion about this at our last meeting, and we are going to, I think, be moving away from submitting the comments via email, or we're not going to be reading them all.

1169
01:37:07,743 --> 01:37:10,124
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's a lot here.

1170
01:37:10,144 --> 01:37:13,666
[SPEAKER_10]: I definitely want to remove

1171
01:37:15,239 --> 01:37:22,006
[SPEAKER_10]: The part where it says members of the public wishing to speak must register their intent prior to the meeting on a form.

1172
01:37:22,726 --> 01:37:27,871
[SPEAKER_10]: That is an inconvenience for the public to register and what their comments are going to be.

1173
01:37:28,812 --> 01:37:34,278
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm not in favor of the way that this is currently written and I'm proposing to change it.

1174
01:37:35,239 --> 01:37:37,681
[SPEAKER_10]: removing that sentence.

1175
01:37:37,921 --> 01:37:40,704
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a motion to... What number is this again?

1176
01:37:40,764 --> 01:37:42,906
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, I wanna... 52.

1177
01:37:43,166 --> 01:37:47,530
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I think you're gonna wanna remove the end of that sentence after that.

1178
01:37:48,290 --> 01:37:48,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1179
01:37:48,851 --> 01:37:51,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so motion on the floor.

1180
01:37:51,913 --> 01:37:57,118
[SPEAKER_02]: I think member McLaughlin and member Hays have other questions on other items, if that's correct.

1181
01:37:58,039 --> 01:38:00,741
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I wanna read 53 again just to understand.

1182
01:38:00,761 --> 01:38:00,741
52.

1183
01:38:01,181 --> 01:38:01,321
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 52.

1184
01:38:04,910 --> 01:38:06,772
[SPEAKER_02]: And member, you want me to read it aloud?

1185
01:38:06,973 --> 01:38:07,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Member McLaughlin?

1186
01:38:09,556 --> 01:38:10,096
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, please.

1187
01:38:10,116 --> 01:38:10,717
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be helpful.

1188
01:38:10,737 --> 01:38:13,360
[SPEAKER_12]: 52, please.

1189
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:15,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'll just read the change.

1190
01:38:15,903 --> 01:38:22,670
[SPEAKER_02]: So right now it reads public comment will be limited to three minutes per individual and will be limited to those matters in the agenda.

1191
01:38:23,471 --> 01:38:24,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Kreatz's

1192
01:38:24,608 --> 01:38:37,215
[SPEAKER_02]: recommending motioning that we strike the next sentence, which says members of the public wishing to speak must register their intent prior to the meeting on a form provided for said purpose by the superintendent.

1193
01:38:38,112 --> 01:38:38,432
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1194
01:38:38,592 --> 01:38:42,675
[SPEAKER_13]: So, um, this is not regarding the, um, intent to present.

1195
01:38:42,735 --> 01:38:43,936
[SPEAKER_13]: This is just to speak.

1196
01:38:43,976 --> 01:38:44,937
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to register.

1197
01:38:44,977 --> 01:38:48,959
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to use a form saying that you want to speak in order to speak at the meeting.

1198
01:38:49,020 --> 01:38:49,760
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that right?

1199
01:38:49,780 --> 01:38:51,221
[SPEAKER_13]: This, this is what this is saying.

1200
01:38:51,761 --> 01:38:52,722
[SPEAKER_13]: I know previous.

1201
01:38:52,922 --> 01:38:53,222
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1202
01:38:53,362 --> 01:38:59,387
[SPEAKER_13]: Previously, the policy has been that, you know, people can queue and they get X amount of minutes to speak.

1203
01:38:59,887 --> 01:39:07,152
[SPEAKER_13]: And so this is saying that if anyone wants to speak at the reading, they have to write to the superintendent on an intent to speak form.

1204
01:39:08,047 --> 01:39:09,488
[SPEAKER_13]: um, to do so.

1205
01:39:10,528 --> 01:39:26,035
[SPEAKER_13]: So I guess what member credits saying that they should, we should not have a form that, um, folks have to fill out to speak at the public meeting, um, in advance, but they can queue and only, you know, still have the three minutes that has been allotted in the past.

1206
01:39:26,055 --> 01:39:32,178
[SPEAKER_13]: So I would second the admission of that requirement of a form for folks to speak at the, at the meeting.

1207
01:39:33,206 --> 01:39:36,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, motion by Member Kreatz, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

1208
01:39:36,429 --> 01:39:38,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Would anybody like to speak before the roll is called?

1209
01:39:39,911 --> 01:39:40,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Ruseau.

1210
01:39:41,913 --> 01:39:43,254
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I got this.

1211
01:39:45,694 --> 01:39:50,018
[SPEAKER_11]: This rule from another community, there's several communities around us that actually do this.

1212
01:39:50,058 --> 01:39:52,601
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not like you have to bring a birth certificate or anything.

1213
01:39:52,621 --> 01:40:10,058
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe, not Zoom, but there's another meeting software that's popular in cities where if you wanna register, if you wanna, you know, when we have our meetings here, you do register to speak, you put your thumb up.

1214
01:40:11,498 --> 01:40:14,879
[SPEAKER_11]: and they have a button in their version of the software.

1215
01:40:14,919 --> 01:40:22,141
[SPEAKER_11]: You click it and say, I'd like to speak on this topic and you just have to give your name and then you're in the queue.

1216
01:40:22,161 --> 01:40:28,743
[SPEAKER_11]: This also allows, I know at least in Somerville, public comment is limited to a certain amount of time.

1217
01:40:29,003 --> 01:40:34,645
[SPEAKER_11]: If two people want to speak, then they get their three minutes or whatever they use there and it's over.

1218
01:40:35,005 --> 01:40:37,886
[SPEAKER_11]: If 200 people want to speak, then the first 10 people get to speak.

1219
01:40:39,196 --> 01:40:43,961
[SPEAKER_11]: This is not a public meeting this is a meeting in public, a critically important distinction.

1220
01:40:45,182 --> 01:40:48,506
[SPEAKER_11]: And it is drilled into us at MSC.

1221
01:40:49,327 --> 01:40:50,067
[SPEAKER_11]: For a reason.

1222
01:40:51,148 --> 01:40:56,734
[SPEAKER_11]: The superintendent, and all the staff that come to these meetings, it is not like the city council.

1223
01:41:00,336 --> 01:41:07,102
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, if the city council meets for a long time and the clerk needs to come in late, then the clerk comes in late.

1224
01:41:08,203 --> 01:41:20,373
[SPEAKER_11]: The superintendent, a half a dozen principals, these are not people who can be just at our leisure until midnight and then expected to show up at 6.30 or seven the next morning all rosy.

1225
01:41:21,053 --> 01:41:23,195
[SPEAKER_11]: And we do this to them over and over again.

1226
01:41:23,696 --> 01:41:27,359
[SPEAKER_11]: So the only point here, there's two points, one,

1227
01:41:28,454 --> 01:41:33,659
[SPEAKER_11]: I really thought that it would be helpful for minutes to simply say, I want to speak.

1228
01:41:35,801 --> 01:41:37,962
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we have the technology to accomplish that at this moment?

1229
01:41:38,003 --> 01:41:39,364
[SPEAKER_11]: Perhaps that's not the case.

1230
01:41:40,004 --> 01:41:49,332
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the other part of this amendment is to strike based on the number of individuals signed up to speak.

1231
01:41:52,668 --> 01:41:55,490
[SPEAKER_11]: agree with striking that, I actually just need something.

1232
01:41:55,710 --> 01:41:57,991
[SPEAKER_11]: Otherwise the chair may limit comment to two minutes.

1233
01:41:58,271 --> 01:42:00,272
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, then we should just change it.

1234
01:42:00,392 --> 01:42:03,574
[SPEAKER_11]: The chair can set comment to anything she wants up to two minutes.

1235
01:42:03,614 --> 01:42:12,639
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I need some, in my mind, I need something else after the chair may limit comment to two minutes.

1236
01:42:15,220 --> 01:42:22,204
[SPEAKER_11]: And like something to indicate, you know, not that the chair would do this, but like if the chair just wanted to get out early tonight,

1237
01:42:22,813 --> 01:42:30,541
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like I'm going to make public comment two minutes, so I can get to the bar, I mean that's not our intent, I think, as a school committee to be limiting public comment.

1238
01:42:32,302 --> 01:42:32,823
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

1239
01:42:33,864 --> 01:42:34,364
[SPEAKER_11]: But you know.

1240
01:42:38,028 --> 01:42:42,112
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what we want to say if we're going to limit it to two minutes why why or how.

1241
01:42:44,036 --> 01:43:03,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's just an educated decision where if you're on a Zoom and there's 400 people and you see 100 people with their hand raised, then at the beginning of the meeting, I would probably say, okay, two minutes here, where if there's 10 people as participants, you can get your full three per resolution.

1242
01:43:05,493 --> 01:43:06,154
[SPEAKER_11]: Mayor, sorry.

1243
01:43:06,834 --> 01:43:09,857
[SPEAKER_11]: Member... So, yeah, just could I...

1244
01:43:10,518 --> 01:43:20,303
[SPEAKER_11]: make a friendly amendment to that based on the number of individuals signed up to speak, just simply based on the number of individuals appearing to want to speak.

1245
01:43:21,724 --> 01:43:25,326
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, yeah, that's, I motion second that.

1246
01:43:26,546 --> 01:43:26,866
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1247
01:43:28,727 --> 01:43:35,371
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we have a resident who would like to speak, member, Attorney Began.

1248
01:43:35,391 --> 01:43:39,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, let me just,

1249
01:43:40,444 --> 01:43:40,966
[SPEAKER_02]: unmute you.

1250
01:43:40,986 --> 01:43:44,736
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, can you hear me?

1251
01:43:45,418 --> 01:43:45,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1252
01:43:46,343 --> 01:43:46,843
[SPEAKER_07]: Great, thanks.

1253
01:43:47,384 --> 01:43:54,008
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, on this particular rule number 52, I had some concerns as a member of the public about it.

1254
01:43:54,048 --> 01:44:07,456
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually had some concerns even going back to the prior meeting because I see a chipping away at public access reminds me a little bit about the discussion going on in the country about limiting ways to vote.

1255
01:44:07,616 --> 01:44:10,698
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like we're limiting ways to have public access to these meetings.

1256
01:44:11,979 --> 01:44:13,340
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand we're not gonna read in

1257
01:44:14,060 --> 01:44:21,243
[SPEAKER_07]: e-mails anymore, which I actually thought was a nice feature that had been adopted because a lot of people don't like to speak in public, even via Zoom.

1258
01:44:22,543 --> 01:44:30,706
[SPEAKER_07]: I know members of my own family would probably rather send e-mails than have to appear and face people face-to-face to get an idea across.

1259
01:44:31,406 --> 01:44:41,409
[SPEAKER_07]: But in particular with this rule, the way it's written, as a member of the public, I'm very much opposed to having to register before a meeting.

1260
01:44:41,649 --> 01:44:42,990
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what it says in the rule here.

1261
01:44:44,781 --> 01:44:49,004
[SPEAKER_07]: If I'm going to speak if I hear something that I think is outrageous during a meeting.

1262
01:44:49,284 --> 01:44:57,550
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to be able to get in my car and go down to City Hall and say something right there and then I don't want to have to have planned ahead or pre registered to do that.

1263
01:44:59,151 --> 01:45:01,873
[SPEAKER_07]: The, the other issue that I noticed is.

1264
01:45:03,616 --> 01:45:09,041
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the chair should have discretion as to the time that people speak.

1265
01:45:09,682 --> 01:45:11,964
[SPEAKER_07]: But also, I think it should be by agenda item.

1266
01:45:12,024 --> 01:45:13,125
[SPEAKER_07]: It shouldn't be by meeting.

1267
01:45:13,666 --> 01:45:20,333
[SPEAKER_07]: In other words, if there's one agenda item, sometimes you have meetings where there's a particular item on the agenda that you know 100 people want to speak on.

1268
01:45:20,913 --> 01:45:23,396
[SPEAKER_07]: So that agenda item should be limited, not the entire meeting.

1269
01:45:23,997 --> 01:45:27,059
[SPEAKER_07]: because there might be other agenda items that only two or three people want to speak on.

1270
01:45:27,699 --> 01:45:30,501
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm just for as much public access as possible.

1271
01:45:31,181 --> 01:45:35,223
[SPEAKER_07]: And I definitely do not think members of the public are making these meetings long.

1272
01:45:35,684 --> 01:45:37,645
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not what's causing these lengthy meetings.

1273
01:45:38,245 --> 01:45:38,585
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1274
01:45:38,605 --> 01:45:40,466
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1275
01:45:42,087 --> 01:45:42,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1276
01:45:42,447 --> 01:45:43,228
[SPEAKER_02]: That was under three minutes.

1277
01:45:46,990 --> 01:45:48,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so we have a motion on the floor.

1278
01:45:49,992 --> 01:45:52,414
[SPEAKER_13]: We had a motion prior to that, right?

1279
01:45:52,454 --> 01:45:53,655
[SPEAKER_13]: Didn't we point of information there?

1280
01:45:53,675 --> 01:45:55,836
[SPEAKER_13]: Did we have a motion prior to that to strike the sentence?

1281
01:45:56,357 --> 01:45:56,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.

1282
01:45:56,677 --> 01:45:59,939
[SPEAKER_02]: A motion to strike the sentence by Member Kreatz, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

1283
01:46:00,580 --> 01:46:04,823
[SPEAKER_13]: And may I just, again, for the motion to strike the sentence, can I comment on that for one second?

1284
01:46:05,543 --> 01:46:06,284
[SPEAKER_02]: Member McLaughlin.

1285
01:46:07,267 --> 01:46:07,607
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1286
01:46:07,967 --> 01:46:28,752
[SPEAKER_13]: So again, with just filling out the form ahead of time and access to the community and family and community engagement, it also just makes me think about, again, things that might be heard spontaneously at the meeting, but also, you know, folks who might have language barriers and other needs that they're not reaching out to fill out a form or maybe don't know about filling out a form ahead of time.

1287
01:46:28,772 --> 01:46:30,752
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't wanna limit access either.

1288
01:46:30,892 --> 01:46:32,973
[SPEAKER_13]: And to that end, I think we should be thinking about

1289
01:46:34,419 --> 01:46:43,222
[SPEAKER_13]: something in here that might talk about, you know, offering translation support if there's any that is needed for folks who do want to speak at school committee meetings.

1290
01:46:43,282 --> 01:46:47,343
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, perhaps we offer something in that vein as well.

1291
01:46:48,063 --> 01:46:50,164
[SPEAKER_13]: And we could think about a process for what that is.

1292
01:46:50,304 --> 01:46:54,505
[SPEAKER_13]: But I am thinking about how to be as inclusive as possible around this.

1293
01:46:54,585 --> 01:46:59,647
[SPEAKER_13]: So I would agree that, you know, again, striking the sentence allows for more

1294
01:47:01,249 --> 01:47:08,330
[SPEAKER_13]: participation, and I'm also thinking about communities that don't generally get the opportunity to do that, not having to fill out a form, so.

1295
01:47:09,270 --> 01:47:11,451
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so on the motion, thank you, Member McLaughlin.

1296
01:47:11,491 --> 01:47:15,472
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion to strike that sentence, does anybody else wanna speak before the roll is called?

1297
01:47:17,112 --> 01:47:19,292
[SPEAKER_02]: Hearing and seeing none, please call the roll.

1298
01:47:19,332 --> 01:47:20,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Member Hays.

1299
01:47:20,332 --> 01:47:21,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Hays, actually.

1300
01:47:24,333 --> 01:47:26,413
[SPEAKER_09]: Just briefly, I had the same question about that.

1301
01:47:26,473 --> 01:47:29,994
[SPEAKER_09]: I was concerned about, as someone who came to a lot of meetings,

1302
01:47:30,472 --> 01:47:37,854
[SPEAKER_09]: There were times where I didn't know ahead of time that there might be something I want to talk about and then it would come up at the meeting and I'd want to ask a question or offer a comment.

1303
01:47:37,914 --> 01:47:42,896
[SPEAKER_09]: And I do understand the intent behind it of trying to streamline and make the meetings more effective.

1304
01:47:42,936 --> 01:47:52,639
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't personally know where the balance is at this point between making them more effective and streamlined and also allowing for public access, but that did concern me.

1305
01:47:52,659 --> 01:47:57,320
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that could be difficult also in terms of for the superintendent, if she was getting a bunch of

1306
01:47:58,095 --> 01:48:01,216
[SPEAKER_09]: requests from people, and what would the timeline be on that?

1307
01:48:01,236 --> 01:48:05,978
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there's a lot of details that could be difficult to follow through on.

1308
01:48:05,998 --> 01:48:07,598
[SPEAKER_09]: So that was my thought.

1309
01:48:07,618 --> 01:48:08,718
[SPEAKER_02]: We need four policies.

1310
01:48:08,939 --> 01:48:10,959
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd need four policies on how to handle that.

1311
01:48:12,600 --> 01:48:13,080
[SPEAKER_09]: Possibly.

1312
01:48:14,200 --> 01:48:20,042
[SPEAKER_02]: So anybody else with three people hands raised, if there's no other questions on that, can we call the roll on that motion?

1313
01:48:21,182 --> 01:48:21,342
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1314
01:48:21,603 --> 01:48:22,123
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Graham?

1315
01:48:24,103 --> 01:48:24,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1316
01:48:25,564 --> 01:48:25,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Hays?

1317
01:48:28,050 --> 01:48:28,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1318
01:48:29,270 --> 01:48:29,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Kreatz.

1319
01:48:30,590 --> 01:48:30,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1320
01:48:32,411 --> 01:48:33,051
[SPEAKER_11]: Member McLaughlin.

1321
01:48:33,951 --> 01:48:34,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1322
01:48:35,151 --> 01:48:35,751
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Mustone.

1323
01:48:36,131 --> 01:48:36,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1324
01:48:37,612 --> 01:48:38,112
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Ruseau.

1325
01:48:38,152 --> 01:48:39,132
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, Mayor Longo.

1326
01:48:39,572 --> 01:48:39,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1327
01:48:39,892 --> 01:48:41,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1328
01:48:41,472 --> 01:48:45,033
[SPEAKER_02]: The second sentence is struck in its entirety.

1329
01:48:47,833 --> 01:48:51,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Ruseau, Member McLaughlin, then Member Kreatz.

1330
01:48:53,334 --> 01:48:54,474
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, sorry, Mayor.

1331
01:48:55,435 --> 01:48:55,875
[SPEAKER_11]: My hand's down.

1332
01:48:59,388 --> 01:48:59,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Kreatz?

1333
01:49:00,889 --> 01:49:01,669
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1334
01:49:01,870 --> 01:49:04,751
[SPEAKER_10]: What group of numbers are we going to talk about next?

1335
01:49:04,851 --> 01:49:07,792
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to just get through, look at my notes.

1336
01:49:09,053 --> 01:49:11,554
[SPEAKER_02]: We're on page eight.

1337
01:49:11,814 --> 01:49:12,575
[SPEAKER_02]: We just went through number 52.

1338
01:49:13,355 --> 01:49:18,578
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have any questions on 53 to 66 to get us through page nine.

1339
01:49:18,598 --> 01:49:25,761
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if anybody else has six o'clock meetings, but we're coming up.

1340
01:49:26,762 --> 01:49:26,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1341
01:49:27,284 --> 01:49:28,865
[SPEAKER_02]: coming up on six o'clock.

1342
01:49:31,327 --> 01:49:33,849
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have any questions on any of those numbers.

1343
01:49:34,890 --> 01:49:42,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so we're on to page 10, which is number 67, 68, page 11, up to rule 75.

1344
01:49:42,895 --> 01:49:44,757
[SPEAKER_02]: We seem to have two questions.

1345
01:49:44,857 --> 01:49:46,678
[SPEAKER_02]: So member Creston, member McLaughlin.

1346
01:49:51,141 --> 01:49:52,362
[SPEAKER_10]: I can wait.

1347
01:49:52,582 --> 01:49:56,285
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a question on 77, so I can hold off for now.

1348
01:49:57,349 --> 01:49:58,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Member McLaughlin.

1349
01:50:00,472 --> 01:50:00,993
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1350
01:50:01,013 --> 01:50:12,424
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a question on 67 and 74 so 67 is motion to rescind which most of it is, I think, probably all of it is according to Robert's rules of order but I think there's some.

1351
01:50:15,507 --> 01:50:37,154
[SPEAKER_13]: nuance that I wanna make sure that we're understanding is that, so a motion to rescind a previous decision that was adopted by the school committee can happen at any time other than the current meeting, which obviously would be a motion to reconsider, but there's no time limit to rescind the motion, but there is some distinction around whether any portion of the motion has been executed.

1352
01:50:37,674 --> 01:50:41,995
[SPEAKER_13]: And if the motion has already been executed or is in the process of execution, it might not be rescinded.

1353
01:50:42,516 --> 01:50:43,556
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just wanna make sure that

1354
01:50:44,272 --> 01:50:49,613
[SPEAKER_13]: my colleagues are understanding, this number 67.

1355
01:50:50,133 --> 01:50:58,455
[SPEAKER_02]: And correct me if I'm wrong, but I could have sworn the Robbins Rules order said you have to rescind by the next day at noon.

1356
01:50:58,635 --> 01:51:01,716
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know why I'm... Yeah, actually, I think, yeah, I don't know.

1357
01:51:01,736 --> 01:51:09,178
[SPEAKER_13]: I have to review it, but there was something about, yeah, for the next... For the next day, I haven't looked at it.

1358
01:51:09,218 --> 01:51:10,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Ruseau?

1359
01:51:11,773 --> 01:51:18,197
[SPEAKER_11]: Robert's rules also clearly states very early on that all these rules are do what you want with them, you can change them.

1360
01:51:18,777 --> 01:51:19,798
[SPEAKER_11]: It can be anything you want.

1361
01:51:21,398 --> 01:51:34,306
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't think for a body such as ours where we're not coming to work eight hours a day, although sometimes it feels like that as a school committee member that such a strict timeline makes any sense.

1362
01:51:37,215 --> 01:51:41,656
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a process requiring us to have two meetings about a policy change.

1363
01:51:42,096 --> 01:51:49,618
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, if we all make a change and, you know, you have to have been somebody who was in the affirmative.

1364
01:51:50,538 --> 01:51:57,079
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, this was, this is only gonna happen when somebody is a supporter of the thing that happened.

1365
01:51:57,580 --> 01:52:01,560
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we find out something that says, oh, we just made a mistake.

1366
01:52:03,501 --> 01:52:03,781
[SPEAKER_11]: That's,

1367
01:52:05,653 --> 01:52:06,674
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I don't see any.

1368
01:52:08,996 --> 01:52:10,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Member McLaughlin, do you want to comment further?

1369
01:52:15,582 --> 01:52:16,603
[SPEAKER_02]: So, member Krantz?

1370
01:52:17,183 --> 01:52:18,404
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, so, hold on.

1371
01:52:21,505 --> 01:52:26,069
[SPEAKER_13]: If the original motion has been acted upon and that action cannot be undone, the motion cannot be rescinded.

1372
01:52:26,569 --> 01:52:34,476
[SPEAKER_13]: So in other words, that will be left up, it sounds like, to the chair to determine whether action has been taken or not, and whether or not the motion can be rescinded.

1373
01:52:34,536 --> 01:52:35,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that accurate?

1374
01:52:35,497 --> 01:52:41,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Ruseau.

1375
01:52:42,122 --> 01:52:43,103
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I would say,

1376
01:52:44,471 --> 01:52:55,017
[SPEAKER_11]: the mayor, the superintendent, our request to get something on the agenda, which we would be putting a motion to rescind on the agenda.

1377
01:52:55,177 --> 01:53:02,121
[SPEAKER_11]: Just like if we put a motion on there to discuss an individual child's IEP and an open public meeting, we couldn't discuss it ever.

1378
01:53:03,282 --> 01:53:09,705
[SPEAKER_11]: The superintendent and certainly the chair would be like, no, you cannot have that on the agenda as an elected official.

1379
01:53:10,816 --> 01:53:11,717
[SPEAKER_11]: the law still applies.

1380
01:53:12,197 --> 01:53:29,990
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would imagine that if one of us sent this in, that the superintendent who receives it would be like, oh, and pause with the anticipation that the thing could be rescinded, unless we put a timeline or something.

1381
01:53:32,571 --> 01:53:38,716
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know that we don't have to get into how specifically this would work, because it would really depend on what the motion was.

1382
01:53:44,878 --> 01:53:47,100
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of times it's two thirds vote, right?

1383
01:53:48,321 --> 01:53:49,702
[SPEAKER_13]: For these, for the rescinding?

1384
01:53:52,985 --> 01:53:53,705
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe so, yes.

1385
01:53:54,966 --> 01:53:56,327
[SPEAKER_13]: This doesn't have that in there either.

1386
01:53:56,748 --> 01:54:07,596
[SPEAKER_13]: So my concern is that people, colleagues take the time to create a motion, you know, they explain it, it gets, you know, the committee approves and it passes, it gets passed and then,

1387
01:54:08,959 --> 01:54:15,263
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, if it's to be rescinded, you know, that we could sort of be going back and forth on this all the time.

1388
01:54:15,363 --> 01:54:21,528
[SPEAKER_13]: If, you know, we have folks who, whatever, want to rescind motions on the regular.

1389
01:54:21,648 --> 01:54:25,530
[SPEAKER_13]: So I have some concern with this and I'm just trying to express it to my colleagues.

1390
01:54:25,570 --> 01:54:28,933
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not really sure how to address it.

1391
01:54:28,993 --> 01:54:32,175
[SPEAKER_13]: So maybe I would make a motion to table number 67.

1392
01:54:34,496 --> 01:54:36,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Graham, then member Ruseau.

1393
01:54:38,101 --> 01:54:40,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, motion to table is undebatable.

1394
01:54:41,882 --> 01:54:43,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a second on the motion to table?

1395
01:54:43,943 --> 01:54:45,683
[SPEAKER_03]: Second.

1396
01:54:46,823 --> 01:54:48,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to second by member Kreatz.

1397
01:54:48,884 --> 01:54:49,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Roll call.

1398
01:54:50,945 --> 01:54:51,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Graham.

1399
01:54:51,925 --> 01:54:52,145
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1400
01:54:53,465 --> 01:54:55,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Hays.

1401
01:55:00,147 --> 01:55:01,388
[SPEAKER_09]: I apologize, I lost track.

1402
01:55:01,428 --> 01:55:02,968
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you tell me the motion again?

1403
01:55:03,468 --> 01:55:05,769
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion is to take table number 67,

1404
01:55:08,081 --> 01:55:08,541
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, no.

1405
01:55:10,042 --> 01:55:10,582
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Kritz.

1406
01:55:13,624 --> 01:55:14,365
[SPEAKER_11]: Member McLaughlin.

1407
01:55:15,405 --> 01:55:15,725
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1408
01:55:16,746 --> 01:55:17,446
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Mustone.

1409
01:55:22,529 --> 01:55:23,410
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Mustone, sorry.

1410
01:55:23,430 --> 01:55:24,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, yes, sorry.

1411
01:55:25,231 --> 01:55:28,632
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Ruseau, no.

1412
01:55:30,614 --> 01:55:31,314
[SPEAKER_11]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn.

1413
01:55:32,671 --> 01:55:35,072
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there should be a time limit of some sort.

1414
01:55:35,092 --> 01:55:40,334
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, four in the affirmative, three in the negative to table number 67.

1415
01:55:43,675 --> 01:55:47,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Member McLaughlin, you have your hand up, then Member Ruseau?

1416
01:55:49,457 --> 01:55:50,357
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, thank you.

1417
01:55:50,717 --> 01:55:51,957
[SPEAKER_13]: If it's okay, I'd like to go to 74.

1418
01:55:51,997 --> 01:55:52,117
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.

1419
01:55:52,137 --> 01:55:52,518
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Ruseau?

1420
01:55:58,154 --> 01:56:07,099
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, since we don't have a set of rules as a school committee, I don't know what to do with a tabled part of a rule that we have not passed.

1421
01:56:07,620 --> 01:56:08,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we have two more minutes.

1422
01:56:08,600 --> 01:56:12,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Two more minutes if we're meeting at six, so just tabled to the next rules meeting.

1423
01:56:14,744 --> 01:56:15,944
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, is that what the language was?

1424
01:56:16,785 --> 01:56:24,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the meeting's four to six, so depending on how the committee feels and who's available,

1425
01:56:35,276 --> 01:56:40,240
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's 558 member McLaughlin.

1426
01:56:41,961 --> 01:56:47,485
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion, I mean, rule number 74, which is to suspend the Roberts Rules of Orders.

1427
01:56:48,389 --> 01:56:50,469
[SPEAKER_13]: parliamentary rules by a two-thirds vote.

1428
01:56:51,590 --> 01:56:56,691
[SPEAKER_13]: I just feel like Robert's Rules of Orders are really consistent around parliamentary rules.

1429
01:56:56,751 --> 01:57:08,173
[SPEAKER_13]: It's hard enough to learn all the parliamentary rules and procedure as a school committee member, and then finally learning them and being able to implement them is concerning if we're just gonna be able to vote them out.

1430
01:57:09,013 --> 01:57:14,974
[SPEAKER_13]: So I have a concern with eliminating Robert's Rules of Order by a two-thirds vote.

1431
01:57:16,219 --> 01:57:21,343
[SPEAKER_13]: most of these committees and others are run on Robert's Rules.

1432
01:57:21,383 --> 01:57:29,930
[SPEAKER_13]: And I guess I would love to hear Member Ruseau's concern with Robert's Rules for 74, please.

1433
01:57:32,392 --> 01:57:33,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Ruseau, then Member Kreatz.

1434
01:57:34,714 --> 01:57:34,994
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

1435
01:57:35,414 --> 01:57:39,517
[SPEAKER_11]: This is actually a pretty common practice, and it is for one meeting.

1436
01:57:39,757 --> 01:57:40,318
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not that

1437
01:57:41,547 --> 01:57:51,577
[SPEAKER_11]: We no longer use Roberts rules, we do this actually on a regular basis that our meetings, we suspend the rules, which is a formality we say with no meaning since we don't have any.

1438
01:57:52,378 --> 01:57:59,004
[SPEAKER_11]: We suspend the rules to move an item out of it out of the out of order on the agenda, that's a suspension that this number 74 allows.

1439
01:58:04,338 --> 01:58:07,381
[SPEAKER_11]: all rule, like we wouldn't just like descend into chaos.

1440
01:58:08,562 --> 01:58:09,543
[SPEAKER_11]: Something's still happening.

1441
01:58:09,563 --> 01:58:10,424
[SPEAKER_11]: We still have a chair.

1442
01:58:12,226 --> 01:58:14,848
[SPEAKER_11]: This is just pretty standard stuff.

1443
01:58:16,430 --> 01:58:17,131
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all I have to say.

1444
01:58:21,034 --> 01:58:21,495
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Kreatz?

1445
01:58:22,691 --> 01:58:24,873
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I was going to ask for some clarification.

1446
01:58:25,153 --> 01:58:35,342
[SPEAKER_10]: And so, so this rule essentially is giving us the permission to suspend the rules, to move an agenda item out of order.

1447
01:58:36,923 --> 01:58:38,505
[SPEAKER_10]: That's, that's what you're saying, Mr. Russo.

1448
01:58:38,545 --> 01:58:38,745
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1449
01:58:38,765 --> 01:58:38,905
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1450
01:58:39,806 --> 01:58:40,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1451
01:58:40,046 --> 01:58:40,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember McLaughlin.

1452
01:58:49,866 --> 01:58:51,788
[SPEAKER_13]: But it could be any of the Roberts rules.

1453
01:58:51,868 --> 01:58:52,969
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's my concern.

1454
01:58:53,089 --> 01:59:02,116
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, following parliamentary procedure is sort of the way that I understand suspending the rules for certain instances.

1455
01:59:02,177 --> 01:59:09,303
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm just not sure why we have to have it written in that we can suspend the Roberts rules of order by a two thirds vote.

1456
01:59:09,563 --> 01:59:11,485
[SPEAKER_13]: If folks want to suspend the rules, we can sort of

1457
01:59:12,324 --> 01:59:28,409
[SPEAKER_13]: figured out then but even with that I would say, you know, if it's, you know, in this, you know, if we do an amendment or something that says, you know, in this one meeting or something like that my concern is you know there's lots of Roberts rules of order and there's a reason that there's Roberts rules of order so that there are rules of order.

1458
01:59:28,990 --> 01:59:37,232
[SPEAKER_13]: And then if we're, you know, having options to suspend the rules of order, it makes me concerned that meetings can become disorderly.

1459
01:59:40,780 --> 01:59:44,943
[SPEAKER_02]: member Kreatz had her hand up and then member Graham, the member herself.

1460
01:59:46,544 --> 01:59:48,006
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, I forgot to lower my hand.

1461
01:59:48,106 --> 01:59:49,467
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, member Graham.

1462
01:59:53,890 --> 01:59:55,711
[SPEAKER_14]: I was it is 602.

1463
01:59:56,312 --> 02:00:07,360
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would like to make a motion to adjourn to adjourn, seconded by second member McLaughlin roll call.

1464
02:00:17,776 --> 02:00:18,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Graham?

1465
02:00:19,077 --> 02:00:19,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1466
02:00:21,880 --> 02:00:22,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Hays?

1467
02:00:23,101 --> 02:00:23,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1468
02:00:24,683 --> 02:00:25,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Kreatz?

1469
02:00:25,984 --> 02:00:26,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1470
02:00:27,605 --> 02:00:28,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Member McLaughlin?

1471
02:00:28,987 --> 02:00:29,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1472
02:00:30,468 --> 02:00:31,029
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Mustone?

1473
02:00:31,369 --> 02:00:31,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1474
02:00:32,850 --> 02:00:33,571
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Ruseau?

1475
02:00:34,292 --> 02:00:34,472
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1476
02:00:36,153 --> 02:00:36,694
[SPEAKER_11]: Mayor Lococo?

1477
02:00:36,714 --> 02:00:36,814
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1478
02:00:38,103 --> 02:00:39,986
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, six in the affirmative, one in the negative.

1479
02:00:40,066 --> 02:00:41,427
[SPEAKER_02]: The meeting is adjourned.

1480
02:00:41,447 --> 02:00:43,130
[SPEAKER_13]: Mayor, can I just make a comment just quickly?

1481
02:00:43,150 --> 02:00:47,075
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to thank Member Ruseau for all the work in putting this document together.

1482
02:00:47,135 --> 02:00:52,222
[SPEAKER_13]: Obviously, did a lot of work, was very involved, so I want to say thank you for that, and I'm looking forward to reconvening on it.

1483
02:00:52,983 --> 02:00:53,103
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.
