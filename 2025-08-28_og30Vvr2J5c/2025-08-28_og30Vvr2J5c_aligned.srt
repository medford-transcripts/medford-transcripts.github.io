1
00:00:03,068 --> 00:00:06,574
All right, everybody, if you have a chair, please take a seat.

2
00:00:06,594 --> 00:00:09,760
There's still a couple here and a couple over here.

3
00:00:12,612 --> 00:00:14,253
Otherwise, I believe we're ready to get started.

4
00:00:15,453 --> 00:00:19,754
Welcome tonight's candidate, a forum put on by the Medford Democratic City Committee.

5
00:00:20,475 --> 00:00:28,257
Our intention was to invite all the candidates to share with the citizens of Medford who they are and why they are running for office.

6
00:00:28,837 --> 00:00:32,198
I'm happy to announce that all the candidates expressed interest in attending.

7
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:36,920
Also, before we move on, I wanted to introduce myself.

8
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:38,100
My name is Bruce Kulik.

9
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:44,862
I'm co-chair of the Medford Democratic City Committee, along with Phyllis Morrison, who will also be our timekeeper tonight.

10
00:00:46,422 --> 00:00:51,804
Unfortunately, George Scarpelli and Justin Tseng are unable to attend in person due to previous commitments.

11
00:00:52,564 --> 00:00:59,086
Mr. Scarpelli sends his regrets, and Mr. Tseng has asked Jessica Attadio to represent him in his absence.

12
00:00:59,946 --> 00:01:07,330
Additionally, Matt Lemming has indicated that he unfortunately needs to leave early, so if you see him bolt out, that's the reason for it.

13
00:01:08,811 --> 00:01:21,517
This event is also being broadcast and recorded for later replay on the Medford Government Channel, which is 22 for Comcast and 43 for Verizon, and via YouTube live stream at YouTube at Medford Community Media and 391.

14
00:01:23,398 --> 00:01:28,479
We have also published a list of websites, Facebook and Instagram IDs supplied by the candidates.

15
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:37,401
There are cards distributed around the room with this information and a QR code to access the recording and Medford Democrat webpage directly.

16
00:01:38,901 --> 00:01:45,102
Additionally, the Medford Democratic City Committee plans to hold additional forums in October before the general election.

17
00:01:45,582 --> 00:01:47,643
We'll let everybody know when that's going to occur.

18
00:01:48,763 --> 00:01:53,948
Before I continue, I'd like to acknowledge any non-municipal elected officials who are in attendance.

19
00:01:54,928 --> 00:01:56,069
I didn't see anybody come in.

20
00:02:00,413 --> 00:02:01,314
Oh, stand please.

21
00:02:06,618 --> 00:02:11,382
So I'm looking for non-municipal candidates and elected officials.

22
00:02:12,163 --> 00:02:12,303
Yes.

23
00:02:15,685 --> 00:02:16,345
Elections Commission.

24
00:02:16,385 --> 00:02:16,946
Okay, thank you.

25
00:02:18,146 --> 00:02:18,966
Anybody else?

26
00:02:19,607 --> 00:02:20,547
I think we're all set with that.

27
00:02:22,568 --> 00:02:27,570
We will first introduce all the candidates, followed by each candidate speaking for up to three minutes.

28
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:33,713
Any remaining time will be used to allow the audience to interact directly with the candidates on a one-to-one basis.

29
00:02:35,012 --> 00:02:41,077
Due to the time limitations, there will be no questions asked to the candidates and no questions from the audience.

30
00:02:41,698 --> 00:02:44,881
Please hold your applause until each candidate has finished their talk.

31
00:02:45,961 --> 00:02:50,025
And with that, Phyllis will introduce the candidates and continue with the program.

32
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,991
Hi everyone and thanks for coming out.

33
00:02:55,031 --> 00:03:04,634
I think it's a really important night for our city and I'm particularly pleased that all of the candidates could be here in person or have sent a representative for themselves.

34
00:03:05,094 --> 00:03:09,916
You know, this is how we get to find out about the people who want to be our representatives in our city.

35
00:03:10,496 --> 00:03:12,317
So thank you to all of the candidates.

36
00:03:12,397 --> 00:03:14,758
We really appreciate your participation in this.

37
00:03:15,498 --> 00:03:19,439
I am going to apologize up front if I say your name incorrectly.

38
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,740
I am doing my best.

39
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:34,826
As I call your name, first I would like to say to you, prior to tonight's event, the Democratic City Committee held a lottery to determine the order in which the candidates would speak.

40
00:03:34,866 --> 00:03:35,927
It was a random draw.

41
00:03:36,587 --> 00:03:40,149
And the candidates, once we did that, the email was sent out to the candidates.

42
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:41,289
They knew their standing.

43
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:43,050
They knew the amount of time they would have.

44
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:47,672
They knew that there would be a warning when they had 20 seconds left to speak.

45
00:03:48,192 --> 00:03:53,295
So, I will go over those points for the candidates once I've introduced them all.

46
00:03:53,815 --> 00:03:58,817
I'm going to call the candidates' name, and I'll ask them to stand, be recognized, and then be seated.

47
00:03:59,337 --> 00:04:01,338
So, Patrick Clerkin.

48
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,560
Nate Merritt.

49
00:04:08,038 --> 00:04:08,738
Matt Lemming.

50
00:04:11,499 --> 00:04:14,320
For Justin Tsang, Jennifer Tadeo.

51
00:04:16,601 --> 00:04:17,301
Liz Mullane.

52
00:04:19,641 --> 00:04:21,842
George Scarpelli.

53
00:04:25,163 --> 00:04:26,123
Anna Callahan.

54
00:04:28,944 --> 00:04:30,264
Nicholas Juleo.

55
00:04:33,986 --> 00:04:35,286
Miranda Berezno.

56
00:04:36,973 --> 00:04:37,873
Did I say it correctly?

57
00:04:37,913 --> 00:04:38,434
Freseno.

58
00:04:38,614 --> 00:04:39,174
Freseno.

59
00:04:39,214 --> 00:04:39,774
I'm sorry.

60
00:04:39,794 --> 00:04:40,454
OK.

61
00:04:41,355 --> 00:04:42,295
Paige Boldini.

62
00:04:45,376 --> 00:04:46,516
Rick Caraviello.

63
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:51,078
Paul J. Donato, Jr.

64
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:54,919
Emily K. Lazaro.

65
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,820
Well, your name isn't next on the list.

66
00:04:58,981 --> 00:05:04,362
Number 13, Melanie.

67
00:05:05,063 --> 00:05:06,003
I apologize.

68
00:05:09,507 --> 00:05:09,767
Ms.

69
00:05:10,007 --> 00:05:12,068
Tringali, I am so sorry.

70
00:05:12,088 --> 00:05:12,608
That's OK.

71
00:05:12,648 --> 00:05:13,489
Mistakes happen.

72
00:05:13,509 --> 00:05:13,889
Thank you.

73
00:05:14,409 --> 00:05:15,549
Emily Calazzaro.

74
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,010
Zach Beers.

75
00:05:20,591 --> 00:05:21,531
Trish Ciapelli.

76
00:05:24,813 --> 00:05:25,693
Melva McDonald.

77
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:32,543
So with that, what's going to happen now is I'm going to return to my seat.

78
00:05:32,663 --> 00:05:36,686
I will call the person who is going to speak first, who is Patrick Clerking.

79
00:05:37,186 --> 00:05:40,289
Patrick, when I give you the go ahead, I'm going to ask you to start speaking.

80
00:05:40,309 --> 00:05:41,970
When I start the timer, I'll give you that.

81
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,652
And at 20 seconds, as I've already shown all of you.

82
00:05:45,232 --> 00:05:46,893
This will be your warning.

83
00:05:47,173 --> 00:05:49,553
I'll raise it right from that seat so you can see it.

84
00:05:50,013 --> 00:05:51,374
You will have 20 seconds left.

85
00:05:51,874 --> 00:05:58,356
Because of the time constraint we have at the library, I am going to have to cut the candidates off at three minutes.

86
00:05:58,536 --> 00:06:02,417
I'm not trying to be rude, and the candidates were told about this prior to.

87
00:06:03,336 --> 00:06:07,260
Please note that there are no questions to be asked during this time frame.

88
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,585
Anytime we have left at the end, you can mingle with the candidates, and we hope there's time to do so.

89
00:06:12,985 --> 00:06:16,068
So thank you once again for coming, and I'm going to take my seat.

90
00:06:16,529 --> 00:06:18,991
I'm going to call Patrick Clerkin to the podium.

91
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:46,885
Hi everyone, I'm Patrick Clerkin, and I'm gonna start off with a little bit of my backstory, and then I'm going to get into why it's relevant and what I'd like to do for Medford.

92
00:06:47,565 --> 00:06:48,986
So I'm a mechanical engineer.

93
00:06:49,246 --> 00:07:00,093
I've worked in both a corporate context as an employee and as a contractor, and I've also been an entrepreneur, and most recently I've worked as a handyman.

94
00:07:00,713 --> 00:07:07,617
And with the handyman work, it's been a lot of meeting neighbors, getting out there, and a lot of practical hands-on stuff, so it's kind of

95
00:07:07,973 --> 00:07:14,617
combining the street smarts and the book smarts and the abstract and the physical hands-on stuff.

96
00:07:15,178 --> 00:07:24,623
So, I have also been involved with a lot of different civic organizations, both as a member and as a leader within those organizations.

97
00:07:25,024 --> 00:07:27,005
Some of them have been Habitat for Humanity,

98
00:07:27,427 --> 00:07:32,348
Big Brother Big Sister, American Red Cross, and the board of my fraternity.

99
00:07:32,748 --> 00:07:39,530
So I want to bring all of those perspectives and experiences to my efforts here in Medford for the city's benefit.

100
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:44,811
And what I wanted to focus on in particular was robust community.

101
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:48,972
And how I see it, community is both communications and unity.

102
00:07:49,787 --> 00:07:58,993
And in 2023, when I ran for the first time, what I saw was that this city has so many resources and there's no hub of communications anymore.

103
00:07:59,293 --> 00:08:07,558
There used to be a paper, there isn't anymore, there's some new things, but basically there's not a dashboard or there's not a consistent reference that people are consulting.

104
00:08:08,078 --> 00:08:13,962
And when you don't have that, it causes anger and fear and distrust and confusion to proliferate.

105
00:08:14,852 --> 00:08:18,855
And so I have a bunch of different ideas as to how to practically address that.

106
00:08:19,235 --> 00:08:19,996
They're on my website.

107
00:08:20,036 --> 00:08:21,357
I can't get into all of them right now.

108
00:08:21,697 --> 00:08:24,540
So I recommend that you consult my website for those.

109
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:37,229
But I will say, if you want a practical example as to how lack of communications negatively affects the city, look at the current zoning issue, how a lot of the people feel that this information has been dropped on them at the last minute.

110
00:08:37,489 --> 00:08:39,331
They feel like things have already been decided.

111
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:45,832
they feel like basically the neighborhoods aren't getting a say in this citywide process.

112
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:59,337
The other aspect of what I wanted to focus on was unity, and I'm already embodying that democracy within my campaign where I've gone to all 16, canvassed all 16 precincts.

113
00:08:59,658 --> 00:09:05,860
I've crossed demographic, geographic, partisan, ideological lines, talked to anyone, I don't care what,

114
00:09:06,227 --> 00:09:08,709
what flag you have in your yard, what letter you have next to your name.

115
00:09:08,809 --> 00:09:13,692
I want everyone to be involved in this process, and I am actively doing that.

116
00:09:13,992 --> 00:09:26,421
So the last thing that I'll say is that I'm focused on independent thinking, on practical solutions, on Medford in its entirety, and on local issues.

117
00:09:26,701 --> 00:09:33,466
So I would be a counselor at large for Medford, not for Massachusetts, not for the United States, not for the world.

118
00:09:33,586 --> 00:09:35,928
So if these are values that you appreciate,

119
00:09:36,678 --> 00:09:40,142
please vote for me on September 16th and on November 4th.

120
00:09:40,442 --> 00:09:40,723
Thank you.

121
00:09:50,754 --> 00:09:52,255
Nate, would you like to come to the podium?

122
00:09:52,575 --> 00:09:53,036
Nate Merritt.

123
00:10:07,973 --> 00:10:13,735
Hi, I'm Nate Merritt, and I'm asking for your vote to represent all of Medford as your next city councilor.

124
00:10:13,835 --> 00:10:15,275
And I swear I do own a tie.

125
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:16,716
Sorry about not wearing that tonight.

126
00:10:17,676 --> 00:10:20,857
I'm running because I think we can get the city on a much better path than it is today.

127
00:10:21,417 --> 00:10:21,957
I'm an engineer.

128
00:10:22,197 --> 00:10:22,798
I fix things.

129
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:24,258
I also help people.

130
00:10:24,298 --> 00:10:26,339
I was an EMT and a firefighter for many years.

131
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:34,821
In fact, last month when I walked into Tanook and I found a child bleeding from the back of his head, I decided to step up and help, because that's what people do.

132
00:10:35,561 --> 00:10:37,182
And I did, and I'm willing to do it in a larger role.

133
00:10:38,348 --> 00:10:38,668
Why me?

134
00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:39,929
Why not these fine folks?

135
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,712
Because I'm going to stay laser focused on Medford.

136
00:10:43,172 --> 00:10:45,894
Not national, not state issues, Medford.

137
00:10:45,954 --> 00:10:47,095
That's the job at hand.

138
00:10:47,996 --> 00:10:59,045
And maybe if we took all these meetings and this negative energy that's been going on to ODARC 30 in the morning, trying to relitigate international foreign conflicts and trade embargoes,

139
00:10:59,555 --> 00:11:07,879
instead focused it maybe on Riverside Ave and the Anheuser-Busch property, which now the MBTA picked up, then maybe we wouldn't be $600,000 in the hole.

140
00:11:08,319 --> 00:11:11,240
We just passed an override for $500,000 to fix our streets.

141
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,281
So who's going to make it up?

142
00:11:12,301 --> 00:11:13,622
And the answer is all of us.

143
00:11:14,322 --> 00:11:15,042
That's not good.

144
00:11:15,362 --> 00:11:16,583
It's not a recipe for success.

145
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:21,011
I want to try to capitalize on the things that the city of Medford has.

146
00:11:21,031 --> 00:11:21,771
We're not Cambridge.

147
00:11:22,151 --> 00:11:23,391
We have Interstate 93.

148
00:11:23,631 --> 00:11:24,652
We've got the Mystic River.

149
00:11:24,832 --> 00:11:25,872
We've got a lot of resources.

150
00:11:25,912 --> 00:11:30,313
Let's use it and not try to turn this into the next 15-minute city like the socialist playbook.

151
00:11:31,973 --> 00:11:34,894
Let's stop the nonsense of saying single-family homes are a thing of the past.

152
00:11:34,934 --> 00:11:35,454
They're not.

153
00:11:35,794 --> 00:11:42,136
The city of Lowell, which is twice the population of Medford, has plenty of single-family zoning, and I think we can, too.

154
00:11:42,976 --> 00:11:46,357
So, in fact, that's what draws people to Medford, including me and my family.

155
00:11:47,285 --> 00:11:48,806
Let's take a smart look at zoning.

156
00:11:49,186 --> 00:11:50,167
This isn't an emergency.

157
00:11:50,207 --> 00:11:52,988
I'm pretty qualified to tell that being a former firefighter and EMT.

158
00:11:53,469 --> 00:11:55,610
We can take our time like we did with the charter review.

159
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:56,971
It's not emergency.

160
00:11:56,991 --> 00:12:01,013
Let's do it right the first time and not try to be like the Titanic going into an iceberg.

161
00:12:02,662 --> 00:12:04,423
I want places in Medford for kids to play.

162
00:12:04,443 --> 00:12:07,544
I've got two Bambinos, and especially in the wintertime, where do you bring them?

163
00:12:07,564 --> 00:12:08,304
We go somewhere else.

164
00:12:08,324 --> 00:12:10,605
You go to Jordan's, you go to Malden, you go everywhere else.

165
00:12:11,145 --> 00:12:13,726
I want people from Assembly Row to come here and bring their kids.

166
00:12:14,186 --> 00:12:15,927
Maybe a sky zone, bigger than that.

167
00:12:16,307 --> 00:12:17,848
Maybe a place to fly indoor drones.

168
00:12:17,868 --> 00:12:25,090
There's a lot of things we could do, but if our zoning, we take up every commercial spot and turn it into mixed-use residential, you're never gonna have a spot for that.

169
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:28,411
I think the city needs some balance, and we need to restore some balance.

170
00:12:28,872 --> 00:12:30,032
Industrial and commercial's good,

171
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:34,010
It helps pay for our roads, our public safety.

172
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:38,252
And I think with your vote, we can move the city forward together.

173
00:12:38,952 --> 00:12:39,673
Let's make it happen.

174
00:12:40,113 --> 00:12:40,393
Thank you.

175
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:00,983
First, I'd like to thank the Democratic City Committee for hosting this event.

176
00:13:01,023 --> 00:13:02,024
My name is Matt Lemming.

177
00:13:02,184 --> 00:13:06,848
I'm a scientist, a naval officer, and for the past two years, a city councilor in Medford.

178
00:13:07,809 --> 00:13:13,873
I grew up in a military family, moved around a lot, did my PhD in the UK and moved to Medford as a postdoc at Mass General.

179
00:13:14,133 --> 00:13:18,417
When I moved here, I could barely pay for a room in a small apartment.

180
00:13:18,457 --> 00:13:22,520
Now, that's not because brain disease research is not valuable.

181
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,863
It's because something about the system is deeply flawed.

182
00:13:26,483 --> 00:13:27,783
In the past 30 years, U.S.

183
00:13:27,863 --> 00:13:35,865
rents have risen 323%, average home prices 441%, and median household income a mere 37%.

184
00:13:35,985 --> 00:13:39,526
And to even begin addressing this, we need to start locally.

185
00:13:39,806 --> 00:13:48,909
So in 2023, after lobbying council to pass an affordable housing trust, I ran for council myself, talked to a whole lot of people, and began serving in 2024.

186
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:57,824
Our state has laws that prevent city budgets from keeping up with inflation and Medford has stagnated in its growth for a long time.

187
00:13:57,944 --> 00:14:02,386
So Medford has a budget problem and Medford's housing is too expensive.

188
00:14:03,086 --> 00:14:10,791
This past term, I and many of my colleagues on council have stopped kicking the can down the road and backed by many parents and young families in the community.

189
00:14:11,211 --> 00:14:20,196
We put on the ballot and campaign for our city's first ever 2.5 override, which staved 40 union jobs in the Medford Teachers Association and funded a full-time road repair crew.

190
00:14:21,334 --> 00:14:28,143
This past term, council approved new public housing for seniors, and I'm working at the state and local level to fund our new affordable housing trust.

191
00:14:28,763 --> 00:14:37,114
The city and the community spent years developing plans to rezone the city, both to address our affordability crisis and dwindling budget, and council is working on that.

192
00:14:38,015 --> 00:14:39,236
Our current zoning is patchwork.

193
00:14:39,276 --> 00:14:40,517
It leads to patchwork development.

194
00:14:40,537 --> 00:14:43,999
It needs to change, and it's needed to change for a very long time.

195
00:14:44,499 --> 00:14:57,487
New zoning will mitigate traffic via transportation demand management program, mandate greener building practices, and with an historic conversion ordinance, maintain the many historic buildings that compose Medford, all while incentivizing housing affordability.

196
00:14:58,988 --> 00:15:08,451
I've made Council a more transparent body by instituting a City Council newsletter, live-streaming our meetings, holding office hours at the Medford Senior Center, and writing about all of it non-stop on my website.

197
00:15:09,569 --> 00:15:18,832
I instituted a first-of-its-kind program to house low-income veterans, and I passed a law that will allow Medford residents to voluntarily donate to an in-need veterans fund on their tax bills.

198
00:15:19,392 --> 00:15:30,915
In January, Council passed a welcoming city ordinance, and in my work with the Democratic City Committee, I spearheaded a campaign to inform non-English-speaking residents of their constitutional rights in these very dire times.

199
00:15:32,269 --> 00:15:35,351
In short, Council has at long last stopped kicking the can down the road.

200
00:15:35,391 --> 00:15:38,473
We need to take action if we're to have an affordable and vibrant city.

201
00:15:38,513 --> 00:15:42,655
I've been putting in the work to do just that, and I will continue to put in the work.

202
00:15:43,135 --> 00:15:46,818
Thank you very much for your time and attention, and don't forget to vote on September 16th.

203
00:16:06,252 --> 00:16:06,472
Yes.

204
00:16:07,473 --> 00:16:08,274
Hello, everyone.

205
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:15,162
My name is Jessica Taddeo, and as a longtime friend and colleague of Councillor Singh, I'm very honoured to be sharing these remarks on his behalf tonight.

206
00:16:16,822 --> 00:16:19,804
I'm Justin Tsang, and I'm honored to be your City Councilor.

207
00:16:20,585 --> 00:16:26,769
I am the son of immigrants who came to Medford chasing the American dream, looking to make strides in finding the cure for cancer.

208
00:16:27,609 --> 00:16:35,134
My parents stretched their dollars and raised me paycheck to paycheck, and without our schools, our neighbors, and this community, that dream would not be possible.

209
00:16:35,635 --> 00:16:38,857
And that's why I've worked these past four years to give back and pay it forward.

210
00:16:39,803 --> 00:16:47,268
Now, as national politicians gamble with our economy and threaten the safety of our neighbors, Medford needs steady hands and bold leadership.

211
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:51,451
I'll always stand up for you because Medford stood up for me.

212
00:16:52,231 --> 00:16:55,493
And over these past four years, we haven't just made progress, we've made history.

213
00:16:56,114 --> 00:17:05,360
While some leaders are focused on turning our neighbors against one another, Medford is leading by example as a city that makes historic investments in our public schools and supports all of its residents.

214
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:11,963
We protected the freedoms of our neighbors with the Gender Affirming and Reproductive Healthcare Ordinance, which I worked on with Councilor Lazaro.

215
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:18,006
And I codified the city's policy of non-cooperation with ICE in non-criminal cases to protect our immigrant neighbors.

216
00:17:18,586 --> 00:17:30,552
We've taken bold steps to fight climate change and protect our green spaces, securing millions in funding to modernize and revitalize parks across the city, increasing accessibility for disabled residents, and offering amenities for all ages.

217
00:17:31,252 --> 00:17:36,375
We're fixing sidewalks and streets that haven't been touched in decades and bringing back bus routes that our families rely on.

218
00:17:37,036 --> 00:17:46,902
Additionally, I've been working with my colleagues to make City Hall more transparent and accessible, with new newsletters, more listening sessions, constituent services in different languages, and the list continues to grow.

219
00:17:47,822 --> 00:18:00,492
While politicians in Washington and up on Beacon Hill continue to cater to their rich donors, we've passed once-in-a-generation reforms to make housing more affordable, increase local business growth, and lead the fight against climate change right here in our backyard.

220
00:18:01,252 --> 00:18:06,596
And as I've talked to neighbors from all corners of life, I truly believe that there is more that unites us than divides us.

221
00:18:07,317 --> 00:18:12,540
I know too many people are feeling the crunch, tired of seeing rents rise and dream of home ownership slip away.

222
00:18:13,341 --> 00:18:18,046
They're tired of seeing their kids and my classmates move because they can't afford to live here anymore.

223
00:18:18,627 --> 00:18:22,792
They're tired of having to choose between paying rent or for child care or for pest mitigation.

224
00:18:23,747 --> 00:18:27,911
The truth is the status quo isn't working, and doing more of the same isn't an option.

225
00:18:28,592 --> 00:18:40,043
And don't get me wrong, this will be hard, and we should be wary of those simply playing politics over simplifying complex problems in the form of flashy sound bites, further perpetuating us versus them attitudes.

226
00:18:40,604 --> 00:18:45,709
But when we really take a moment to sift through all of that noise, we can focus on our shared goals.

227
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:47,411
Making Medford

228
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:57,038
making Medford more affordable, ensuring we hold big developers accountable in our institutions to fight against displacement.

229
00:18:57,459 --> 00:18:58,879
And that's why I'm running for re-election.

230
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:00,460
Thank you.

231
00:19:12,613 --> 00:19:17,115
Thank you to Phyllis, Bruce, and the Medford Democratic City Committee for organizing tonight's event.

232
00:19:17,536 --> 00:19:18,496
My name is Liz Mullane.

233
00:19:18,956 --> 00:19:28,822
I'm an Assistant Vice President of Advancement at Northeastern University, and in that role, I oversee six different teams within our department, which includes parents, planned giving, athletics, and the library.

234
00:19:29,522 --> 00:19:37,787
Since 2020, I've been an adjunct faculty member at Northeastern's graduate non-profit management program, instructing adult learners on how to build a non-profit business.

235
00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:48,650
I have been in the industry for over 20 plus years with one of my first jobs at EMILY's List, an organization that raises money for pro-choice Democratic women running for office.

236
00:19:49,311 --> 00:20:06,240
Since then, I've continued to work within organizations reviewing budgets and creating revenue streams for a variety of issue areas, like need-based scholarships for students, medical advancements for Alzheimer's and other autoimmune diseases, and capital funding for community-based needs around mental health and the library.

237
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:13,306
In each of these situations, I have successfully raised funds through individual, foundation, corporate, federal, and government grant outreach.

238
00:20:14,167 --> 00:20:23,155
As a consultant to nonprofits, I also witnessed the need for further education around budgeting, financial management, and strategic planning, so I went back to school to receive my MBA.

239
00:20:23,896 --> 00:20:27,679
I moved to Medford in 2018, where I was a renter until we purchased our home here.

240
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,563
Along with my husband and our two dogs, Medford is where we plan on staying.

241
00:20:32,705 --> 00:20:41,091
I have been involved with the Medford Democratic City Committee and serving as the Ward 2 Chair for the past few years, trying to get more individuals involved in the local political process.

242
00:20:41,812 --> 00:20:46,896
I was compelled to join the City Council race after witnessing areas in Medford that needed addressing.

243
00:20:47,476 --> 00:20:53,821
Numerous accidents due to lack of pedestrian signage, poorly kept streets, and sidewalks that have become hard to navigate.

244
00:20:54,181 --> 00:20:58,465
With budgetary issues being a top concern and a lack of proper funding to some of our

245
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:05,454
more important community services, I felt both my professional background coupled with my education would bring a different skill set to the city.

246
00:21:06,255 --> 00:21:14,526
If elected, I plan to champion for a continued transparent budgeting process with clear updates on how funds are being used, allocated, and distributed.

247
00:21:15,327 --> 00:21:28,799
to review how the city approaches funding, and to help find new and creative ways to generate revenue, especially for our community services, Likert Library, senior care, and mental health staffing, all of which I have successfully done in my professional career.

248
00:21:29,904 --> 00:21:35,587
Incentivize and streamline the process for small businesses to enter Medford, which would only help to grow our commercial tack base.

249
00:21:36,247 --> 00:21:46,053
As a dog owner with no backyard, focus on improved sidewalks and streets and more green space by proactively working on the 2026 Medford Open Space and Recreation Plan.

250
00:21:46,813 --> 00:22:05,484
continue to support the Affordable Housing Trust to make housing more affordable in Medford through linkage fees and fundraising initiatives, complete a pedestrian safety audit across the city to ensure a more walkable Medford, and to continue providing funding and support of the Medford public school system, which is imperative for our entire community's ongoing success.

251
00:22:06,145 --> 00:22:13,989
I've enjoyed meeting so many Medford residents through this process, and I remain a listening ear to anyone who wants to discuss these issues or any other concerns.

252
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:14,790
Thank you.

253
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,902
Thank you so much for hosting this and thank you all for being here.

254
00:22:25,942 --> 00:22:29,084
My name is Anna Callahan and I am a first term incumbent.

255
00:22:29,584 --> 00:22:32,426
I am really proud of the things that we did this term.

256
00:22:32,826 --> 00:22:35,868
We took many steps to stabilize our city's budget.

257
00:22:36,769 --> 00:22:41,652
We really worked on our rodent problems, enabling our staff to be able to take more actions.

258
00:22:42,532 --> 00:23:04,527
To reign those in we we protected did a number of things to protect our residents from the Trump administration and we've taken steps toward more affordable housing and affordability in our city and You can count on me To be a vote in favor of what I believe are the values that we share here in Medford and that includes

259
00:23:05,047 --> 00:23:06,688
affordability and affordable housing.

260
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:09,390
It includes environment and climate change.

261
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:12,032
It includes being a more inclusive city.

262
00:23:13,312 --> 00:23:20,397
But today, I want to highlight for you the things that make me unique as a city councilor.

263
00:23:21,338 --> 00:23:28,142
That really is in the question of democracy and engaging people in the political process.

264
00:23:29,089 --> 00:23:38,957
I take it very seriously that 90 or 95% of the people who live in Medford will never come to a city council meeting and they will never reach out to their city councilors.

265
00:23:39,678 --> 00:23:48,385
So I take it upon myself to spend my time and effort in going into the community and listening to those people so that they have a voice.

266
00:23:49,186 --> 00:23:56,410
I currently have five different teams of volunteers who help me with different parts of my city councilorship.

267
00:23:56,970 --> 00:24:02,073
The first one, and by the way, if anybody here wants to be on one of these teams, please do let me know.

268
00:24:03,474 --> 00:24:05,996
The first one is what I call my legislative team.

269
00:24:06,116 --> 00:24:11,859
It's a group of people who meets with me before every city council meeting and we go through every item on the agenda.

270
00:24:12,199 --> 00:24:15,341
They do a lot of research, they'll reach out to other members of the community.

271
00:24:16,322 --> 00:24:19,164
It's a great way to really level up people who already are active.

272
00:24:19,985 --> 00:24:22,527
The second team I call my democracy team.

273
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:28,293
This is a group of people that helps me to set up listening sessions throughout the community.

274
00:24:28,753 --> 00:24:34,318
Sometimes they're based on a policy, sometimes they're based on a demographic group, sometimes they're just in a neighborhood.

275
00:24:35,399 --> 00:24:37,740
And then I have three different policy teams.

276
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:44,223
One of those is around trees because we plant less than half as many trees each year as we lose.

277
00:24:44,703 --> 00:24:57,308
So we are organizing, we're gonna be organizing with the city to have events where big groups of neighbors come together to plant trees in our most barren neighborhoods.

278
00:24:58,328 --> 00:25:01,690
The second one, the other two are around housing and housing affordability.

279
00:25:02,931 --> 00:25:08,175
One is a group of people that came to me and were interested in getting co-housing here in Medford.

280
00:25:08,615 --> 00:25:13,318
And the last one is around home sharing, which is really enabling people to age in place.

281
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:17,201
So if anyone's interested in working with me, please let me know.

282
00:25:17,421 --> 00:25:18,802
And I really appreciate you all being here.

283
00:25:34,343 --> 00:25:34,743
Hi, everyone.

284
00:25:34,823 --> 00:25:35,504
I'm Nick Giurleo.

285
00:25:35,524 --> 00:25:36,424
Thank you all for being here.

286
00:25:36,824 --> 00:25:38,125
Just a little bit about my background.

287
00:25:38,445 --> 00:25:40,686
I grew up in Medford, lived here my whole life.

288
00:25:41,187 --> 00:25:46,649
Went to Medford High School, graduated number one in my class, and decided to stick around for college and ended up going to Tufts University.

289
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,150
Great education there.

290
00:25:48,971 --> 00:25:52,272
And after that, I decided to work for a little bit.

291
00:25:52,573 --> 00:25:54,874
I ended up working here in the square, actually, for a law office.

292
00:25:54,914 --> 00:25:58,796
Really got interested in law through that experience, and decided I would go to law school.

293
00:25:58,836 --> 00:26:00,997
So I went to law school, ended up at BC Law.

294
00:26:01,582 --> 00:26:04,605
Graduated from BC Law, became an attorney, and that's what I do today.

295
00:26:04,625 --> 00:26:06,787
I work for a great firm in downtown Boston.

296
00:26:07,528 --> 00:26:10,650
Just one little brief thing about here about why am I running, right?

297
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:11,291
Why am I running?

298
00:26:11,751 --> 00:26:15,055
I'm running because being civically involved is really important for me.

299
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:15,915
I want to be involved.

300
00:26:16,015 --> 00:26:21,420
It's important to not complain when you have problems with what's going on in the city, but to take a step forward and do something about that.

301
00:26:21,821 --> 00:26:25,885
So I decided I needed to step forward and do something about the things that concern me.

302
00:26:26,465 --> 00:26:30,366
So two issues that I just want to talk to you about in my very brief time here.

303
00:26:30,706 --> 00:26:33,787
Number one, that's been central to my campaign, affordability.

304
00:26:34,207 --> 00:26:37,727
Medford is, as everyone probably knows, an increasingly unaffordable place to live.

305
00:26:37,847 --> 00:26:43,849
Long-time residents feel pressured out of their homes, and residents who want to move here feel like they can't because of barriers.

306
00:26:44,049 --> 00:26:45,189
So what can we do about that?

307
00:26:45,209 --> 00:26:49,730
In my opinion, the main reason for unaffordability is just the burden that residents have.

308
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:54,811
in meeting our spending needs, primarily through property taxes, which is where we get the majority of our revenue.

309
00:26:55,171 --> 00:27:03,393
I think we can be smarter, though, and take that burden off them and shift it into areas like commercial, bringing businesses to Medford and also preserving our commercial tax base.

310
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:08,995
The commercial tax rate is nearly double the residential, so we get significant revenue through that.

311
00:27:09,455 --> 00:27:10,055
That's one issue.

312
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:12,651
is transparency.

313
00:27:12,671 --> 00:27:15,772
And for me, that primarily means council accessibility.

314
00:27:15,812 --> 00:27:19,133
So allowing the city council to be a resource that everybody can use.

315
00:27:19,573 --> 00:27:22,815
So there's a lot of problems in terms of accessibility that we have to do something about.

316
00:27:23,295 --> 00:27:31,078
Very late running meetings, last minute agenda changes, getting very off topic often with the agenda items, as well as

317
00:27:31,938 --> 00:27:36,322
Reductions in the public speaking time at the expense of hearing people's opinions.

318
00:27:36,902 --> 00:27:41,786
So I think we can do simple things like change the rules of our city council to make it more accessible.

319
00:27:41,886 --> 00:27:45,048
And also I'm interested in information too, public information.

320
00:27:45,428 --> 00:27:47,710
Voters should be informed, they have a right to be informed.

321
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:57,738
What can we do to make public records more accessible to our citizens, honoring requests and making sure people don't feel left out, people don't feel that communications are lacking.

322
00:27:58,238 --> 00:28:00,039
So these are two issues central to my campaign.

323
00:28:00,639 --> 00:28:03,500
Again, I thank you all for being here, and I would very much appreciate your vote.

324
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:03,920
Thank you.

325
00:28:22,447 --> 00:28:22,847
Testing.

326
00:28:23,047 --> 00:28:23,207
Okay.

327
00:28:25,742 --> 00:28:26,482
Good evening, everyone.

328
00:28:26,662 --> 00:28:27,862
My name is Miranda Berseno.

329
00:28:28,463 --> 00:28:36,284
I love calling Medford home, and I'm running for City Council to make sure that City Hall delivers better for residents of all ages, wages, and backgrounds.

330
00:28:37,744 --> 00:28:44,606
We deserve a Medford that invests robustly in the public places that keep us connected to each other, like our schools, parks, and library.

331
00:28:45,366 --> 00:28:47,486
We deserve a library that is open seven days a week.

332
00:28:47,986 --> 00:28:50,687
We deserve a Medford with plenty of shade trees and green space.

333
00:28:52,175 --> 00:28:57,376
As a renter, I felt firsthand how hard it is to afford to remain here amid the skyrocketing cost of living.

334
00:28:57,837 --> 00:29:08,239
We all deserve a more affordable Medford, where elders can age in place and where new and long-time residents alike can put down roots without fear of displacement due to rising rents and home prices.

335
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:14,381
Medford students and families deserve thriving public schools and expanded after-school and pre-K.

336
00:29:15,161 --> 00:29:17,042
Our school staff deserves competitive pay.

337
00:29:17,942 --> 00:29:21,343
I will fight for a budget that allows us to meet these goals every single year.

338
00:29:22,178 --> 00:29:25,399
In addition, I proudly support building a new flagship Medford High School.

339
00:29:27,479 --> 00:29:38,262
We deserve a Medford that invests in keeping all of our neighbors safe through an unarmed mental health crisis response team, continued noncompliance with ICE, and better social services for our neighbors in need.

340
00:29:39,623 --> 00:29:41,623
Safety also means our roads and sidewalks.

341
00:29:42,023 --> 00:29:44,844
And as a transportation planner, road safety is my bread and butter.

342
00:29:45,464 --> 00:29:51,726
In the last five years, Medford has seen at least 84 crashes which resulted in serious injuries or fatalities.

343
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,021
we need to treat traffic violence like the emergency it is.

344
00:29:56,241 --> 00:30:01,182
At MassDOT, I work with municipalities to help them utilize transportation funding to its full potential.

345
00:30:01,902 --> 00:30:07,804
I work closely on funding for large capital projects and I help manage essential programs such as the Safe Routes to School program.

346
00:30:08,684 --> 00:30:13,865
This has given me a bird's eye view of the regional problems that affect us here in Medford and where the solutions lie.

347
00:30:14,741 --> 00:30:20,904
As your city councilor, I will make sure we strategically leverage our transportation funding to make our streets safer.

348
00:30:21,765 --> 00:30:29,369
I will also make sure the city completes an ADA transition plan so that everyone can participate in civic life and enjoy all that Medford has to offer.

349
00:30:30,549 --> 00:30:33,711
But before my time at MassDOT, I worked right here for Medford City Hall.

350
00:30:34,552 --> 00:30:44,517
I spearheaded Medford's COVID-19 Business Relief Grant Program, which provided crucial funding to Medford's restaurants, corner stores, salons, and spas to help them survive during an unpredictable time.

351
00:30:45,268 --> 00:30:50,774
I developed the city's first outdoor dining program, and I helped the city improve its bus stop and blues bikes infrastructure.

352
00:30:52,255 --> 00:30:57,500
As a MassDOT employee, I'm heavily involved in my union, and I currently serve on its board of directors.

353
00:30:58,842 --> 00:31:05,509
Medford runs on union power, and I'm proud to be endorsed by SEIU Local 509 and UAW Region 9A.

354
00:31:06,955 --> 00:31:10,479
I love being a part of our diverse, multi-generational, vibrant community.

355
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:15,985
My neighbours have always been there for me, and now I'm running for City Council to make sure the city is there for you.

356
00:31:16,786 --> 00:31:20,130
I look forward to meeting you and talking with you, and I hope to earn your vote this fall.

357
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:20,611
Thank you.

358
00:31:31,218 --> 00:31:32,359
My name is Paige Valdini.

359
00:31:32,739 --> 00:31:38,704
I'm the owner of Paige Aesthetic Skincare in the Hillside, a Medford public school parent, and I serve on the board of the Medford Chamber of Commerce.

360
00:31:39,244 --> 00:31:40,485
My husband, Jeff, grew up here.

361
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:45,809
Our daughter, Kate, is a second grader at Missittuck, growing up in the same schools and community her dad once did.

362
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:52,995
Nearly seven years ago, I started my business as a new mom and kept it open through the pandemic, when many in my industry closed.

363
00:31:53,475 --> 00:31:56,177
I had to adapt, problem solve, and keep revenue coming in.

364
00:31:56,698 --> 00:31:58,979
That's not easy as a solo business owner, but I did it.

365
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:04,583
I also helped others in the skincare industry push through because I believe in lifting people up.

366
00:32:04,843 --> 00:32:05,544
That's who I am.

367
00:32:05,564 --> 00:32:08,705
I don't quit, I adapt, I listen, and I follow through.

368
00:32:09,126 --> 00:32:10,406
And that's what I'll bring to City Hall.

369
00:32:11,347 --> 00:32:22,194
Those lessons also reflect the spirit of Medford, a city with deep roots and tradition, a city that's growing and changing, and above all, a city whose strength is in its people, our schools, our small businesses, and the city services that keep us running.

370
00:32:23,094 --> 00:32:25,835
I've seen what happens when we bring those pieces together.

371
00:32:26,355 --> 00:32:29,317
As a chamber board member, I work to support small businesses.

372
00:32:29,537 --> 00:32:33,899
I've coached and sponsored local youth sports, and I know the value of showing up for kids and families.

373
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:39,461
Partnering with the PTOs and schools, I've helped expand resources for students, families, and educators.

374
00:32:40,101 --> 00:32:48,628
And by connecting groups like the Chamber run Medford and Tufts University, I've helped raise funds to bring Tufts student-athletes in as volunteers for school and community events.

375
00:32:49,189 --> 00:32:53,993
Proof of what's possible in a reminder that Tufts can be a stronger financial partner and better neighbor.

376
00:32:55,374 --> 00:32:58,678
That's why I believe leadership has to rise above groups or sides.

377
00:32:59,239 --> 00:33:01,021
I chose to run unaffiliated.

378
00:33:01,462 --> 00:33:05,307
It would be easier to do this with a group or a slate, but that's not why I'm here.

379
00:33:06,148 --> 00:33:12,516
I'm willing to take the harder path to represent everyone, to bridge divides, and to make decisions rooted in what's best for Medford.

380
00:33:13,217 --> 00:33:14,238
This is a critical moment.

381
00:33:14,598 --> 00:33:17,741
Decisions on zoning and growth will shape our future for decades.

382
00:33:18,222 --> 00:33:22,966
When zoning reform came forward, I asked to slow it down, not to stop it, so we could get it right.

383
00:33:23,486 --> 00:33:31,633
I championed separating business districts with mixed use from residential, and I used that time to ask questions and push for input from fire, police, and educators.

384
00:33:32,134 --> 00:33:33,955
That's how I will approach every issue.

385
00:33:34,356 --> 00:33:38,299
Do the work, listen first, and make decisions with real-life data and community voices.

386
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:42,163
That same approach must guide our budget and growth.

387
00:33:42,463 --> 00:33:44,945
We need to generate more revenue to make Medford stronger.

388
00:33:45,346 --> 00:33:50,170
That means creating a developer program with clear expectations that ensures developers support our infrastructure.

389
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:58,377
It means attracting the right businesses shaped by community feedback to fill vacant storefronts and bring in revenue that Medford needs to invest in our future.

390
00:33:58,917 --> 00:34:00,839
What sets me apart is I've lived this.

391
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:02,601
I've run a business here.

392
00:34:02,701 --> 00:34:05,904
I've navigated challenges and I stayed the course when it would have been easier to quit.

393
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:10,647
That experience makes me the candidate best prepared to strengthen Medford's future.

394
00:34:11,267 --> 00:34:12,968
At the end of the day, what I bring is different.

395
00:34:13,168 --> 00:34:15,009
I've proven I can get through hard challenges.

396
00:34:15,169 --> 00:34:17,190
I'm connected across Medford.

397
00:34:17,571 --> 00:34:20,893
I adapt, I listen, and I solve problems, and I'm not afraid to show up for the work.

398
00:34:21,933 --> 00:34:27,877
After more than 15 years of living here, I believe Medford's best days are ahead, and I will keep showing up, asking questions, and moving forward together.

399
00:34:28,337 --> 00:34:32,679
Thank you to the Medford Democratic Committee, to my fellow candidates, and to everyone here showing up for our city.

400
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:33,460
Thank you.

401
00:34:45,562 --> 00:34:45,902
Thank you.

402
00:34:46,903 --> 00:34:51,965
Tonight, I would like to thank the Memphis Democratic City Committee for allowing me to speak here for you.

403
00:34:52,545 --> 00:34:53,646
My name is Rick Caraviello.

404
00:34:53,806 --> 00:34:59,288
I have served for 12 years as city councilor and three terms as council president.

405
00:34:59,589 --> 00:35:04,311
And I'm also proud to be standing in a building that I played a major role in bringing to our city.

406
00:35:05,051 --> 00:35:11,394
I am very thankful for the overwhelming support I have received, encouraging me to run again for city council.

407
00:35:11,794 --> 00:35:12,975
Tonight, I stand before you

408
00:35:13,935 --> 00:35:17,816
not just as a candidate, but someone who believes deeply in the power of community.

409
00:35:18,297 --> 00:35:23,879
I have walked these streets, shopped our local businesses, and listened to your concerns at coffee shops and kitchen tables.

410
00:35:24,479 --> 00:35:30,681
As a result, I am running again because I believe Medford deserves leadership that listens, acts, and delivers.

411
00:35:31,601 --> 00:35:35,863
We are a community rich in history, diversity, and untapped potential.

412
00:35:36,123 --> 00:35:37,624
But potential alone is not enough.

413
00:35:37,964 --> 00:35:40,345
We need a city council that reflects our values,

414
00:35:41,397 --> 00:35:42,778
in fights for our future.

415
00:35:43,398 --> 00:35:48,482
The most contentious issue facing Medford is the proposed citywide rezoning and development.

416
00:35:48,722 --> 00:35:52,004
The top priority of the council is to protect our neighborhoods.

417
00:35:52,244 --> 00:35:55,447
However, this commitment has been put aside by this council.

418
00:35:55,787 --> 00:36:00,830
This council wants to rezone our residential areas to allow two to six units per house lot.

419
00:36:01,391 --> 00:36:03,973
This is a direct attack on Medford's character.

420
00:36:04,613 --> 00:36:08,756
We should instead be concentrating on our commercial base and its potential.

421
00:36:09,707 --> 00:36:15,448
Meffitt has business districts with untapped potential for growth, but smart growth, not overgrowth.

422
00:36:16,108 --> 00:36:19,349
Let us build on that rather than changing its character.

423
00:36:19,989 --> 00:36:26,430
I will seek out common-sense proposals for our business districts that will increase tax revenue, promote job opportunities.

424
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:33,351
I will also advocate for responsible development that will protect our neighbors and expand affordable housing options.

425
00:36:34,351 --> 00:36:38,392
Police, fire, and DPW need to be supported by our public officials.

426
00:36:39,018 --> 00:36:41,940
Long overdue contracts need to be settled.

427
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,842
Our streets have long been neglected, and it's time to address the matter at hand.

428
00:36:47,783 --> 00:36:50,704
Charter change is also on November's ballot.

429
00:36:51,345 --> 00:36:53,626
Please make sure that you support this initiative.

430
00:36:54,523 --> 00:36:55,684
This campaign is about us.

431
00:36:55,944 --> 00:37:00,048
It's about building a Medford where everyone feels heard, respected, and empowered.

432
00:37:00,429 --> 00:37:03,211
I will listen to your concerns, ensure your voice is heard.

433
00:37:03,552 --> 00:37:10,138
My priority is to restore trust in City Hall by making sure that the City Council serves the public, not politicians.

434
00:37:10,458 --> 00:37:12,280
So tonight, I ask for your support.

435
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,164
Let us make Medford stronger, fairer, and more united than ever before.

436
00:37:17,425 --> 00:37:17,705
Thank you.

437
00:37:27,598 --> 00:37:31,580
Hello, I'm Paul Donato Jr., and I'm running to be your next city councilor.

438
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:37,723
I'm a lifelong resident, born here and married with four children, with two currently in the school system.

439
00:37:38,984 --> 00:37:44,946
I want to thank you for giving me three minutes to speak, because if I was in front of the Medford City Council, I would only have two.

440
00:37:47,248 --> 00:37:47,988
I love Medford.

441
00:37:48,527 --> 00:37:53,911
It's a city with rich past and great resources, and most importantly, amazing people.

442
00:37:54,571 --> 00:37:58,174
Our residents come from all walks of life and all age groups.

443
00:37:58,994 --> 00:38:05,019
And whether they've lived here for decades or just moved in, they'll all help make Medford what it is.

444
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,942
What we all share is a desire to see Medford grow and thrive.

445
00:38:11,223 --> 00:38:18,248
To make that happen, we need strong leadership and a city government that truly works for the people.

446
00:38:19,475 --> 00:38:23,638
We need leaders with vision who involve the community in shaping the future.

447
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,822
One example is the city's recent rezoning efforts.

448
00:38:29,383 --> 00:38:29,983
The problem?

449
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:35,748
The community didn't ask for a complete overhaul of every neighborhood.

450
00:38:36,468 --> 00:38:48,258
I believe we should take a smarter, more focused approach, starting with key areas like Mystic F. Right now, it's just a busy road, but it could be so much more.

451
00:38:49,074 --> 00:38:58,466
With thoughtful planning, we could add housing, support local businesses, bring in new shops, and improve safety and the look of the area.

452
00:38:59,607 --> 00:39:05,335
But these changes come from real conversations with the community, not top-down decisions.

453
00:39:06,448 --> 00:39:09,071
Another area full of potential is Medford Square.

454
00:39:09,691 --> 00:39:19,161
We've had plenty of studies and good ideas like more housing, riverfront walking paths, restaurants, parking, and shops that people want.

455
00:39:20,242 --> 00:39:27,350
I've worked with the City Council and residents to turn those ideas into actions through workshops and open discussions.

456
00:39:28,453 --> 00:39:37,315
As we plan these improvements, we also need to think about our infrastructure, things like roads, buildings, utilities, and city services.

457
00:39:38,615 --> 00:39:46,877
We must ask, do we have enough police, firefighters, and DPW workers and staff and equipment to support these changes?

458
00:39:47,637 --> 00:39:52,858
I'll make sure infrastructure planning is a required part of the development or rezoning project.

459
00:39:53,684 --> 00:40:00,546
Smart rezoning and solid infrastructure planning are two key areas that I'll focus on as your new city councilor.

460
00:40:01,126 --> 00:40:08,209
But I'll also work with the new effective council to tackle other challenges and build a bright future Medford.

461
00:40:08,889 --> 00:40:14,711
I'd be honored to earn your vote and you can contact me at donato4medford.com.

462
00:40:14,911 --> 00:40:15,251
Thank you.

463
00:40:26,652 --> 00:40:27,832
Hi, I'm Melanie Tringali.

464
00:40:28,472 --> 00:40:30,013
I don't know how I'm going to top that, Paul.

465
00:40:30,053 --> 00:40:36,714
But anyways, first of all, I want to thank the Medford Democrat City Committee for organizing this event.

466
00:40:37,954 --> 00:40:40,294
I'm a longtime resident of Medford and a homeowner.

467
00:40:40,854 --> 00:40:44,435
My husband, James Murdoch, and I live on Forest Street with our four children.

468
00:40:45,235 --> 00:40:49,096
Both my parents were born and raised here and graduated from Medford High.

469
00:40:49,636 --> 00:40:52,936
My father, Salvatore J. Tringali, lived in South Medford.

470
00:40:53,557 --> 00:40:55,757
And my mother, Lorraine Mifflin, grew up on the hillside.

471
00:40:56,697 --> 00:41:00,958
I'm a graduate of UMass Amherst, and have over 20 years of business experience.

472
00:41:01,739 --> 00:41:04,219
As long as I have lived here, I have served this community.

473
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:13,942
I served on the Medford Family Network Advisory Board, was co-chair of the PTO for what was then the Columbus School, and served on the Historic District Commission.

474
00:41:14,823 --> 00:41:21,705
Today, I'm a board member of the Rotary Club, an organization that provides services to the city and schools.

475
00:41:23,608 --> 00:41:26,610
I'm running because this is my home and a city I deeply love.

476
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:32,333
I want to serve this community, make a positive impact, and ensure Medford is the best it can be.

477
00:41:33,963 --> 00:41:40,887
I believe in common sense change, the kind that strengthens neighborhoods, improves city services, and respects the history and character of our community.

478
00:41:41,867 --> 00:41:47,690
As a councilwoman, there are many things I will work on, but given the time tonight, let me highlight my top four priorities.

479
00:41:48,871 --> 00:41:52,172
One, I will always protect our neighborhoods and historic squares.

480
00:41:52,813 --> 00:41:56,094
Blanket rezoning would forever change our neighborhoods and community.

481
00:41:56,835 --> 00:42:02,358
Instead, we should focus on thoughtful commercial development that grows our tax base and revitalizes our squares.

482
00:42:03,358 --> 00:42:07,022
Two, our streets and sidewalks continue to be in disrepair.

483
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:11,627
Recent staffing changes and overrides have not made significant improvements.

484
00:42:12,388 --> 00:42:15,071
Potholes remain and sidewalks are unsafe.

485
00:42:16,072 --> 00:42:22,900
Safe, walkable sidewalks and well-maintained streets are basic services that meet the needs of every citizen in the city.

486
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:28,096
Our first responders risk their lives every day to keep us safe.

487
00:42:28,777 --> 00:42:34,579
They deserve to be fully staffed, have safe and clean facilities, and the equipment to do their jobs well.

488
00:42:35,439 --> 00:42:37,740
Public safety must come first in our city budget.

489
00:42:38,821 --> 00:42:39,261
And fourth,

490
00:42:39,981 --> 00:42:43,342
For the fourth year in a row, Medford has had a large amount of free cash.

491
00:42:43,883 --> 00:42:50,425
The percentage of that free cash exceeds most cities our size of what is considered to be a normal percent of budget.

492
00:42:51,266 --> 00:42:58,369
I will push for line item budget breakdown and responsible planning so taxpayer dollars are spent wisely and timely.

493
00:42:59,369 --> 00:43:02,971
In closing, Medford deserves a City Council that puts Medford first.

494
00:43:03,631 --> 00:43:09,513
Protecting our neighborhoods, fixing our streets and sidewalks, supporting our first responders, and spending responsibly.

495
00:43:10,194 --> 00:43:15,536
As an independent candidate, I will bring balance, common sense, and accountability to City Hall.

496
00:43:16,056 --> 00:43:21,899
On Tuesday, September 16th, I respectfully ask for one of your seven votes for Medford City Council.

497
00:43:22,219 --> 00:43:22,539
Thank you.

498
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:32,751
Good evening, everyone.

499
00:43:33,232 --> 00:43:34,914
Thank you for spending your Wednesday night with us.

500
00:43:35,475 --> 00:43:38,759
My name is Emily Lozaro, and I am running again to be your city councilor.

501
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:49,913
Before being a politician, I'm a writer, a mom of two kids in our public schools, and a cyclist, and an advocate who ran for office because I was living out the effects of failed policy.

502
00:43:50,411 --> 00:43:52,192
and I decided I wanted to be part of the solution.

503
00:43:53,273 --> 00:44:01,517
Working in pursuit of a community of care, a city that stands beside each other, not against one another, has underscored my personal and professional life.

504
00:44:02,378 --> 00:44:12,343
As the former assistant director and the current president of the Malden Warming Center, I can attest that our community members with the greatest challenges are worthy of care and have inherent value and dignity.

505
00:44:12,936 --> 00:44:21,283
Forty percent of Medford households experience hunger, and 7,500 Medford residents qualify for affordable housing, and we don't have anywhere for them to live.

506
00:44:22,884 --> 00:44:28,188
I've done a lot of listening, consensus building, and learning in my first term, and it reminds me of why I ran for office.

507
00:44:28,849 --> 00:44:30,610
Government can't be afraid to do what's right.

508
00:44:31,171 --> 00:44:33,012
I'm ready to continue in that mission together.

509
00:44:33,893 --> 00:44:41,339
I've worked diligently on legislation that shores up the rights of our residents, like the Welcoming City Ordinance and the Gender Affirming Care and Reproductive Healthcare Ordinance.

510
00:44:41,877 --> 00:44:43,898
protecting our neighbors from federal overreach.

511
00:44:44,638 --> 00:44:55,903
I've worked with state legislators and city public safety officials to make major improvements to rotaries where Dan Dill and Arthur Weber, Medford residents, were killed crossing the street in crosswalks this past winter.

512
00:44:56,663 --> 00:45:04,386
I secured $750,000 of funding in the supplemental budget as part of the millionaire's tax to improve the rotaries near Dan Dill's crash.

513
00:45:04,446 --> 00:45:05,767
Those improvements are happening right now.

514
00:45:05,807 --> 00:45:06,607
You can actually see them.

515
00:45:08,616 --> 00:45:12,799
I am fortunate enough, if I am fortunate enough to earn your vote once more, I will keep up this good work.

516
00:45:13,339 --> 00:45:24,667
I'm advocating for our fire department by asking our mayor to use free cash, Melanie and I agree on free cash, to fund a full dive team to keep our residents safe in our beautiful lakes and rivers.

517
00:45:25,307 --> 00:45:28,129
Our firefighters are ready to protect Medford, let's help them do it.

518
00:45:28,990 --> 00:45:36,795
I'm working closely with our business community to ensure that Medford is a beautiful and friendly place to operate with vibrant and bustling squares and business districts.

519
00:45:37,466 --> 00:45:48,435
I am working closely with parents and elementary schools across Medford to reimagine the citywide elementary alliance, ensuring the money raised is shared equitably based on the diverse needs and populations from Glenwood to Hillside.

520
00:45:49,676 --> 00:45:59,685
And as a member of the Medford Comprehensive High School Building Committee, I'm working collaboratively to deliver a brand new high school for our students to learn and grow, and so that our community can feel a newfound sense of Mustang pride.

521
00:46:00,786 --> 00:46:05,590
I talk to residents at the senior center, Wegmans, the disability fair, soccer practice,

522
00:46:06,103 --> 00:46:08,885
car park, elegant nails, and everywhere in between.

523
00:46:08,905 --> 00:46:13,148
I see you, I hear you, and I take action for you, whoever you are.

524
00:46:14,108 --> 00:46:22,955
You deserve an elected official who believes wholeheartedly in the inherent worth of every human being, and who will stand up boldly for the policy that reflects that.

525
00:46:23,635 --> 00:46:26,177
And above all else, this campaign is about taking care of each other.

526
00:46:27,290 --> 00:46:31,799
Everybody deserves to love where they live and a city council that will work tirelessly for their community.

527
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,105
You can count on me to continue to put in that work.

528
00:46:35,406 --> 00:46:35,626
Thank you.

529
00:46:49,272 --> 00:46:53,075
Thank you for the committee for hosting this event and my fellow candidates for being here today.

530
00:46:53,415 --> 00:46:54,156
I'm Zach Baers.

531
00:46:54,896 --> 00:47:01,962
Six years ago, I ran for Medford City Council because I saw what decades of shrinking government and reactive decision-making had done to our city.

532
00:47:02,823 --> 00:47:04,404
Medford had become a city of no.

533
00:47:05,205 --> 00:47:08,087
No, you can't get help at City Hall unless you know the right person.

534
00:47:08,807 --> 00:47:12,811
No, the city won't address the housing crisis that's made it too hard to build a future here.

535
00:47:13,511 --> 00:47:18,235
No, the city won't stop the slow bleed of decades of budget cuts that left our streets crumbling

536
00:47:18,615 --> 00:47:21,957
and our schools without the resources students and teachers need to thrive.

537
00:47:22,617 --> 00:47:29,461
But together, we've accomplished so much to do big things, make hard decisions, and start to become a City of Yes.

538
00:47:30,221 --> 00:47:37,385
A city that says yes to more transparent, open government, with clear goals, processes, and principles for how we make decisions together.

539
00:47:38,041 --> 00:47:50,333
Yes to finally creating a comprehensive plan, already rezoning Mystic Ave, and doing the rezoning project that will encourage real and transformative growth, build more housing, and revitalize our business districts.

540
00:47:51,153 --> 00:47:56,959
Yes to passing questions seven and eight last year to stop the bleeding and invest in our schools and DPW.

541
00:47:57,559 --> 00:48:03,385
And yes to a real plan for growth and new revenue so we don't rely on regular overrides to provide basic services.

542
00:48:04,593 --> 00:48:12,796
This has only been possible because of the commitment of so many residents and city leaders to work together for a simple and just cause.

543
00:48:13,517 --> 00:48:17,578
To make Medford, and even better place, a city that works for all of us.

544
00:48:18,479 --> 00:48:23,280
A city that leads with shared values, clear principles, and delivers real results for our residents.

545
00:48:24,121 --> 00:48:27,202
A city government committed to leading with compassion, hard work,

546
00:48:27,653 --> 00:48:38,621
and supporting those most in need, to listening to the unheard, not just the loudest voices, to making tough choices and telling people the hard truths, not the easy falsehoods we might want to believe.

547
00:48:39,501 --> 00:48:41,082
Voters have a clear choice this November.

548
00:48:41,583 --> 00:48:43,164
Do we vote to keep moving forward?

549
00:48:43,644 --> 00:48:48,928
My answer is yes, and I believe the people of the city of Medford will keep saying yes to moving forward too.

550
00:48:50,249 --> 00:48:55,112
It's been the honor of my life to serve my hometown, and if I earn your vote for my fourth term,

551
00:48:55,733 --> 00:49:02,340
I guarantee that I will keep fighting for a Medford where our city government lifts everyone up and solves big problems together.

552
00:49:02,961 --> 00:49:10,369
If you want compassionate, principled, and effective leadership to keep Medford moving forward, I ask for your vote on September 16th and November 4th.

553
00:49:10,649 --> 00:49:10,910
Thank you.

554
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:21,840
Good evening.

555
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:26,644
I am Trish Ciappelli, an independent candidate and homeowner running for the City Council.

556
00:49:27,244 --> 00:49:31,127
I moved here to attend Simmons and completed my MBA in 2001.

557
00:49:31,607 --> 00:49:40,513
I have 20 years of experience as a commercial lender in the banking industry, working with CEOs and CFOs with companies with revenues of $10 million to $60 million.

558
00:49:42,054 --> 00:49:52,143
I became politically active in Medford when I led the battle to stop a methadone dispensary from coming to my Salem Street neighborhood, just .23 miles from an elementary school.

559
00:49:52,904 --> 00:49:55,486
And then again with the radical rezoning of Salem Street.

560
00:49:55,966 --> 00:50:02,252
After many protests from us, the residents, the OCD, delistened and rolled back the zoning to what the neighborhood wanted.

561
00:50:02,892 --> 00:50:13,662
Unfortunately, this City Council, under the leadership of Zach Baers and a motion from Matt Lemming, denied the citizens what they wanted and reverted back to the original zoning.

562
00:50:14,303 --> 00:50:18,807
We must stop radical rezoning, which is now being proposed across the city.

563
00:50:19,468 --> 00:50:24,253
Our job on the City Council is to protect our neighborhoods, not exploit them.

564
00:50:24,913 --> 00:50:30,176
Yes, we must upgrade our squares and business districts, but not to the detriment of our neighborhoods.

565
00:50:30,696 --> 00:50:33,857
Our city has been left to deteriorate for far too long.

566
00:50:34,297 --> 00:50:36,278
Density is not going to solve that.

567
00:50:36,779 --> 00:50:45,223
The recent fire that took place in Somerville and demolished three homes less than a week ago was caused by all of their zoning changes to accommodate density.

568
00:50:45,783 --> 00:50:51,966
Be warned, this will happen here if we allow the density City Council wants forced on our neighborhoods.

569
00:50:52,526 --> 00:50:53,827
I will fight for our neighborhoods.

570
00:50:54,647 --> 00:50:56,769
We must request a forensic audit.

571
00:50:57,210 --> 00:51:08,702
We all work hard for our money and it is incumbent for the city to accurately report to the public exactly how, where, why our money is being spent, dollar for dollar.

572
00:51:09,633 --> 00:51:12,715
Yes, we have an audit annually by state-approved firm.

573
00:51:13,115 --> 00:51:17,058
However, we taxpayers deserve better financial reporting.

574
00:51:17,819 --> 00:51:26,905
Once our finances are in order, we can then make a sound decision and plan to fix our roads, fix our sidewalks, and get the lead out of our drinking water.

575
00:51:27,305 --> 00:51:28,566
Medford deserves better.

576
00:51:29,106 --> 00:51:31,247
We need to increase our commercial tax rate.

577
00:51:31,527 --> 00:51:34,628
The homeowners can't be the sole source of tax revenue.

578
00:51:35,188 --> 00:51:46,872
We just lost $600,000 in tax revenue on the old Budweiser campus because our mayor allowed it to be sold to the MBTA, the same MBTA that she sits on the board of directors.

579
00:51:47,492 --> 00:51:57,396
I ask you, Madam Mayor, isn't that a conflict of interest, selling out the taxpayers of this city to do a favor for a state agency of which you are a board member?

580
00:51:58,590 --> 00:52:02,411
I most certainly would find that is to be the case, in my opinion.

581
00:52:02,872 --> 00:52:05,333
And we must support our police and fire departments.

582
00:52:05,953 --> 00:52:07,673
They are very important to our city.

583
00:52:08,254 --> 00:52:20,278
After meeting with the President of Firefighters Local 1032, I learned that our fire department is understaffed to meet the needs of our current population and will not meet the needs of the proposed expansions.

584
00:52:20,738 --> 00:52:22,679
Remember, a vote for me is a vote for you.

585
00:52:22,899 --> 00:52:24,340
I respectfully ask for your vote.

586
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:25,140
Thank you.

587
00:52:40,944 --> 00:52:48,027
Thank you to the Medford Democratic City Committee, the Library, my fellow candidates, and everyone for coming and tuning in.

588
00:52:48,807 --> 00:53:00,012
I'm Milva McDonald, and the story of why I'm running for City Council starts a long time ago, as a kid growing up with an immigrant working-class mom who came to America from Italy in the 1950s.

589
00:53:01,813 --> 00:53:05,537
She was the hardest worker I've ever known and she passed her work ethic on to me.

590
00:53:06,518 --> 00:53:18,989
Whether working at the Boston Globe while raising my four kids, sitting on the board of non-profits, or helping launch the Mystic LGBTQ plus youth support network, I have always put in the hard work required to get things done.

591
00:53:20,170 --> 00:53:23,974
A few years ago, I decided charter review needed to get done in Medford.

592
00:53:24,715 --> 00:53:37,667
In 2021, I convened a group of residents to pursue options, and in late 2022, at our request, Mayor Brianna Lungo Kern formed the Medford Charter Study Committee and appointed me as chair.

593
00:53:38,568 --> 00:53:44,711
For two years, I led our 11-member committee in a comprehensive review of our city's foundational document.

594
00:53:45,432 --> 00:53:53,196
As a result, for the first time in 40 years, a new charter is projected to be on your municipal ballot this November.

595
00:53:54,396 --> 00:53:58,058
My experience chairing the committee inspired me to run for office.

596
00:53:58,799 --> 00:54:05,322
I want to bring the same level of research, outreach, and deep listening to the work of being your city councilor.

597
00:54:07,485 --> 00:54:15,527
My priorities include growing the city's tax base through zoning, reviewing fee structures, and fighting for a better pilot agreement with Tufts.

598
00:54:16,287 --> 00:54:19,168
Addressing the affordable housing crisis is a necessity.

599
00:54:19,508 --> 00:54:23,369
We must support the Affordable Housing Trust and the Community Land Trust.

600
00:54:24,109 --> 00:54:33,131
To ease the burden on taxpayers and renters, we should explore a residential exemption for owner-occupied homes and look further at the good landlord tax credit.

601
00:54:34,211 --> 00:54:44,359
We need to ensure that we are meeting the goals in the Climate Action and Adaptation Plan, which continues to safeguard Medford for the future while improving life now.

602
00:54:45,279 --> 00:54:54,526
Medford has great cultural organizations, but I believe the arts need an anchor at City Hall, so I support the installation of a City Arts Coordinator.

603
00:54:55,567 --> 00:55:04,254
As councillor, I would also work to create a commission to promote visibility, equality, and empowerment of our LGBTQ plus community.

604
00:55:05,275 --> 00:55:14,162
I think it's also the job of municipal officials to support our dedicated city staff and those in need, like seniors on fixed incomes and immigrant communities.

605
00:55:14,983 --> 00:55:19,087
I love people, hearing their concerns and stories, and doing my best to help.

606
00:55:19,767 --> 00:55:34,440
As a second-generation Italian-American with working-class roots, I will always put in the time, effort, and research needed to get the job done, and I will make responsiveness and respect priorities in all my interactions.

607
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:43,627
I'm excited to get to work to make our beloved city an even better place to live, and I ask for your vote in September and November.

608
00:55:43,768 --> 00:55:44,128
Thank you.

609
00:55:52,961 --> 00:55:54,646
I really want to thank the candidates.

610
00:55:54,746 --> 00:55:55,869
They did a fabulous job.

611
00:55:55,890 --> 00:55:57,073
But I must say, yes.

612
00:56:04,135 --> 00:56:17,041
In full disclosure, I put up the yellow card about 15 seconds sooner for one of the candidates, and I was going to add it on to the end, and the person finished.

613
00:56:17,521 --> 00:56:22,984
So Mr. Merritt, I want to know if you have one thing more you want to say, because you'll be able to sing.

614
00:56:25,185 --> 00:56:28,349
I mean, I would have added it on the end, but he finished his speech.

615
00:56:28,490 --> 00:56:31,994
And I so apologize, but he didn't want to say, come back.

616
00:56:32,295 --> 00:56:40,105
And I didn't want to say to all of you, but full disclosure, it was one timing error that I profusely apologize for.

617
00:56:40,125 --> 00:56:41,807
I am sorry.

618
00:56:44,412 --> 00:56:45,152
Okay, good.

619
00:56:45,292 --> 00:56:45,653
Thank you.

620
00:56:45,693 --> 00:56:46,673
But I did want to say that.

621
00:56:47,013 --> 00:56:49,114
So thanks everybody for coming.

622
00:56:49,194 --> 00:56:53,015
I think it's such a great turnout and I think we have a wonderful pool of candidates.

623
00:56:53,656 --> 00:56:55,796
And I say, Bruce, would you like to say anything?

624
00:56:56,917 --> 00:56:57,477
We're all set.

625
00:56:57,537 --> 00:56:58,517
Thank you all for coming.

626
00:56:58,577 --> 00:56:58,958
Mingle.

627
00:56:59,158 --> 00:56:59,858
Have a great night.
