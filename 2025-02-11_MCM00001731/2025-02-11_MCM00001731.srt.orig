1
00:00:00,723 --> 00:00:02,103
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, I'll call the meeting to order at 7.

2
00:00:03,104 --> 00:00:03,584
[SPEAKER_07]: 05 PM.

3
00:00:03,604 --> 00:00:18,649
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just going to read the governor's statement, and then we'll get going on our agenda on March 29 2023 governor Healy signed into law supplemental budget bill, which, among other things, extends the temporary provisions pertaining to the open meeting law on March 31st 2025.

4
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:32,354
[SPEAKER_07]: Specifically, this further extension allows public bodies to continue holding meetings remotely without a quorum for the public body physically present at a meeting location and to provide adequate alternative access to remote meetings.

5
00:00:32,774 --> 00:00:40,616
[SPEAKER_07]: The language does not make any substantive changes to the open meeting law other than extending the expiration date to March 31st, 2025.

6
00:00:40,656 --> 00:00:49,479
[SPEAKER_07]: Dennis, on that note, just at the end of the meeting, remind me to touch base about that date.

7
00:00:51,362 --> 00:00:55,284
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so we have a full packed agenda tonight.

8
00:00:56,525 --> 00:01:00,787
[SPEAKER_07]: We will start with 140 Summer Street.

9
00:01:01,408 --> 00:01:06,531
[SPEAKER_07]: So 140 Summer Street, just to let everybody know, did not meet the signage requirements.

10
00:01:06,851 --> 00:01:10,273
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're gonna table it until next month.

11
00:01:10,513 --> 00:01:17,677
[SPEAKER_07]: I need a motion on the table from the commissioners to table this item for 30 days pending the owner.

12
00:01:19,113 --> 00:01:22,256
[SPEAKER_07]: placing the sign on the property and reposting the legal ad.

13
00:01:23,837 --> 00:01:28,981
[SPEAKER_11]: I move to table discussion of 140 Summer Street until the signage has been addressed.

14
00:01:29,001 --> 00:01:32,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, and second?

15
00:01:34,245 --> 00:01:34,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Was that you, Doug?

16
00:01:35,246 --> 00:01:35,466
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

17
00:01:37,428 --> 00:01:41,231
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'll go around the room as I see it.

18
00:01:42,132 --> 00:01:42,412
[SPEAKER_07]: Peter?

19
00:01:43,033 --> 00:01:43,273
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

20
00:01:44,213 --> 00:01:44,614
[SPEAKER_07]: And Kit?

21
00:01:45,014 --> 00:01:45,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

22
00:01:45,955 --> 00:01:46,435
[SPEAKER_07]: And Doug?

23
00:01:46,916 --> 00:01:47,176
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

24
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:48,237
[SPEAKER_07]: And Eleni?

25
00:01:48,881 --> 00:01:49,161
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

26
00:01:49,682 --> 00:01:49,882
Great.

27
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:51,064
[SPEAKER_07]: Approved 4-0.

28
00:01:51,204 --> 00:01:55,210
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

29
00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:03,542
[SPEAKER_07]: I will revise the legal notice and I will have the owners put the sign up and we will try to hear it next month.

30
00:02:05,693 --> 00:02:06,674
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, fourth.

31
00:02:07,014 --> 00:02:11,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Next up on the agenda is 31 Wilson Street.

32
00:02:11,236 --> 00:02:22,843
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioners, I put in the Google Drive for you some photos of the property from our site visit from two weekends ago, I think.

33
00:02:23,353 --> 00:02:28,074
[SPEAKER_07]: whenever the last time we had snow was before this, because it started snowing when we went there.

34
00:02:28,714 --> 00:02:31,355
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm happy to provide some thoughts on that.

35
00:02:31,475 --> 00:02:38,916
[SPEAKER_07]: And I did post the MHC inventory form online for the general public to see.

36
00:02:39,816 --> 00:02:45,217
[SPEAKER_07]: For anybody that's following along, you can go to our website at www.MedfordHistoricalCommission.org.

37
00:02:47,858 --> 00:02:52,472
[SPEAKER_07]: go to the news section and see that I posted all sorts of information earlier today.

38
00:02:54,538 --> 00:03:04,307
[SPEAKER_07]: with the various attachments for this meeting, among which includes the MHC inventory form for 31 Wilson Street, and the determination of findings.

39
00:03:04,407 --> 00:03:13,014
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to go through and explain the demo delay process for the benefit of all the applications and processes that follow in this wake.

40
00:03:13,634 --> 00:03:15,916
[SPEAKER_07]: So hopefully we'll get that all done all at once right now.

41
00:03:16,777 --> 00:03:19,820
[SPEAKER_07]: The demo delay process is a two-step process that begins

42
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:25,143
[SPEAKER_07]: with the applicants filing at the commission's regular meetings.

43
00:03:25,804 --> 00:03:27,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Usually those are the second Monday of every month.

44
00:03:28,426 --> 00:03:40,794
[SPEAKER_07]: And once we receive an application, if we don't already have it, we have a consultant prepare an MHC inventory form that sort of describes the architecture and the history of the building.

45
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:49,043
[SPEAKER_07]: The first step that the commission does in reviewing the demo delay is to determine whether or not a building is significant.

46
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:59,614
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've already done that for this building, but for the sake of some of the other cases, a significant building is either a building that's listed on the National Register of Historic Places or pending that.

47
00:04:00,575 --> 00:04:29,982
[SPEAKER_07]: has been listed on the State Register of Historic Places, or is 75 years older, determined by the Commission to be significant either because it is importantly associated with one or more historic persons or events, or with the broad architectural, cultural, political, economic, or social history of the city or the Commonwealth, or it is historically or architecturally important in terms of period style, method of building construction, or association with an important architect or builder, either by itself or in the context of group of buildings.

48
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:35,887
[SPEAKER_07]: So once we determined that this building is significant, we have to hold a public hearing within 30 days.

49
00:04:36,728 --> 00:04:41,693
[SPEAKER_07]: So tonight we will be hearing that public hearing portion of the case.

50
00:04:42,674 --> 00:04:47,238
[SPEAKER_07]: And the public is welcome to speak for or against the demolition of this building.

51
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:51,423
[SPEAKER_07]: And the commission is trying to determine whether or not the building is preferably preserved.

52
00:04:51,563 --> 00:04:53,044
[SPEAKER_07]: Does it have enough integrity and

53
00:04:55,286 --> 00:05:13,450
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that integrity enough to warrant a pause in the demolition process to mitigate the demolition, to come up with some sort of alternative, be it documentation or design review or moving the building, saving the building, and incorporating it into the new design, et cetera?

54
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:17,191
[SPEAKER_07]: Every building and case that comes before us is different and unique.

55
00:05:17,391 --> 00:05:24,133
[SPEAKER_07]: So for those of you who are watching, you'll see the full spectrum of type of cases that we review on a regular basis.

56
00:05:25,874 --> 00:05:31,158
[SPEAKER_07]: So I am going to start with the commissioners.

57
00:05:31,339 --> 00:05:36,543
[SPEAKER_07]: If you guys have any comments, we'll start with a motion to put it on the table to start discussion.

58
00:05:36,663 --> 00:05:46,051
[SPEAKER_07]: And then from there, we can open to public comment for and against, and then we'll close that.

59
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:48,954
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll have any final comments, and we'll take the next steps.

60
00:05:50,215 --> 00:05:51,356
[SPEAKER_07]: Any questions from the commissioners?

61
00:05:53,647 --> 00:05:59,694
[SPEAKER_07]: For the general public, when the time comes, if you could, please use the raise hand function if you can.

62
00:06:00,955 --> 00:06:05,200
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're on the phone or have some sort of other device, just make yourself known.

63
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,605
[SPEAKER_07]: Just try not to interrupt anybody and I'll make sure you get called on.

64
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:13,910
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, commissioners, I'll entertain a motion, please.

65
00:06:21,808 --> 00:06:26,110
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, a motion to find the building not carefully preserved.

66
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:31,312
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, and a 2nd.

67
00:06:36,654 --> 00:06:37,174
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll 2nd.

68
00:06:37,194 --> 00:06:43,037
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, was that kid?

69
00:06:43,617 --> 00:06:44,337
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, it was.

70
00:06:44,357 --> 00:06:44,618
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

71
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:47,905
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so that'll kickstart discussion.

72
00:06:48,726 --> 00:06:59,596
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll start by providing a little bit of clarity for our site visit, because I'm sure you guys saw the photos, but if not, they're in the Google Drive.

73
00:07:00,036 --> 00:07:05,501
[SPEAKER_07]: So we were able to tour both the lot and the interior of this building.

74
00:07:06,001 --> 00:07:06,782
[SPEAKER_07]: The interior

75
00:07:08,203 --> 00:07:13,908
[SPEAKER_07]: clearly demonstrates that it is a much older building than its 1930s construction date.

76
00:07:14,909 --> 00:07:27,039
[SPEAKER_07]: All of the materials within date to two time periods, all the wooden sort of original features are 19th century construction.

77
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:39,889
[SPEAKER_07]: And then at some point, the building had or lost its plaster finish, I guess, and it's been replaced with 1970s paneling.

78
00:07:43,371 --> 00:07:46,792
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, that's sort of not uncommon for this type of house.

79
00:07:47,532 --> 00:08:01,854
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it confirmed that the building is much older as it was sort of verbally relayed to us by one of the previous people who was a relative of the owner of the house.

80
00:08:02,234 --> 00:08:11,516
[SPEAKER_07]: And I can't say specifically that it was a school, but it certainly had a vibe that was not necessarily entirely residential.

81
00:08:12,596 --> 00:08:18,302
[SPEAKER_07]: a weird layout, and it has some sort of late Victorian features.

82
00:08:18,563 --> 00:08:29,455
[SPEAKER_07]: So that is definitely a nice confirmation that came out of the site visit, and the photos kind of confirm that.

83
00:08:32,717 --> 00:08:35,178
[SPEAKER_07]: So, so Doug, you made the motion.

84
00:08:35,218 --> 00:08:37,398
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll start with you now that I've made that clarification.

85
00:08:37,438 --> 00:08:39,439
[SPEAKER_13]: Just I just want to appreciate that.

86
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:40,399
[SPEAKER_13]: Right?

87
00:08:40,439 --> 00:08:44,260
[SPEAKER_13]: I did not go on the site is that I have reviewed the photos that were taken on the inside and the outside.

88
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:44,680
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you.

89
00:08:45,941 --> 00:08:51,262
[SPEAKER_13]: Suggesting that the form that we have is inaccurate then because it doesn't date anything before.

90
00:08:51,282 --> 00:08:52,842
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't believe before 1925, 6, right?

91
00:08:55,683 --> 00:09:12,428
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, he says at the end of the form, if you look at it, that it was verbally relayed to us that the original owners dismantled a schoolhouse in the city of Boston somewhere, in one of the suburban communities.

92
00:09:13,088 --> 00:09:16,791
[SPEAKER_07]: dismantled and brought it to this site.

93
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:22,236
[SPEAKER_07]: And this house shares the exact same footprint as the building next to it.

94
00:09:22,656 --> 00:09:24,578
[SPEAKER_07]: So I suspect that they're related.

95
00:09:24,598 --> 00:09:30,443
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you look at the pictures of the framing in the basement, it's not traditional.

96
00:09:33,405 --> 00:09:39,410
[SPEAKER_07]: sort of late balloon or even early platform framing, it's actually heavy timber.

97
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:45,054
[SPEAKER_07]: And it is balloon up the sidewall, and that is highly irregular for 1920s.

98
00:09:46,995 --> 00:09:51,799
[SPEAKER_07]: So all the beadboard and the interior doors are all 19th century.

99
00:09:53,900 --> 00:10:03,687
[SPEAKER_07]: They all have all the same hallmarks as stuff that was built probably up to 40 years, but probably not more than that, so like 1880s, 1870s.

100
00:10:05,949 --> 00:10:10,252
[SPEAKER_13]: So is there no record of this on the Medford maps?

101
00:10:11,092 --> 00:10:16,876
[SPEAKER_13]: Medford schools are usually pretty well known when they were built and torn down historically.

102
00:10:16,996 --> 00:10:18,858
[SPEAKER_13]: Does this somehow slip through the cracks?

103
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:21,037
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it's a local school.

104
00:10:21,097 --> 00:10:28,826
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's a school outside of the city that was moved here and turned into a residence.

105
00:10:29,988 --> 00:10:30,488
[SPEAKER_07]: Rosindale.

106
00:10:30,508 --> 00:10:31,269
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's right.

107
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:32,291
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

108
00:10:33,112 --> 00:10:33,292
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

109
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:35,995
[SPEAKER_07]: And I, I reached out to the, the.

110
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:59,898
[SPEAKER_07]: local historical groups and there are some photos of school buildings from that time period but you know I there's the building is this build the buildings that were there were two-story buildings much bigger than this building so it'd be kind of hard to sort of piece together unless we really dissected the framing and looked at how how they sort of changed it it's just you know

111
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:09,062
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's raising some need to know additional things here out of this building before, you know, before it gets let go.

112
00:11:10,818 --> 00:11:11,499
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I understand.

113
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:14,741
[SPEAKER_13]: I just, you know, I'm trying to imagine a school building.

114
00:11:14,761 --> 00:11:20,786
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe it was just they added inserted a floor because you said it had seven foot ceilings, right?

115
00:11:21,027 --> 00:11:23,208
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that's that's 140 Summer Street.

116
00:11:23,228 --> 00:11:23,569
[SPEAKER_13]: That's 140.

117
00:11:23,669 --> 00:11:24,810
[SPEAKER_13]: OK, very good.

118
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:28,373
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no, this is this has pretty generous eight and a half foot ceilings.

119
00:11:28,453 --> 00:11:32,796
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got a nice low, low roof line that was clearly

120
00:11:33,837 --> 00:11:46,529
[SPEAKER_07]: uh... altered at some point you can see where they sort of sawed through and maybe cut pieces of it and it had some fire damage from you know it's occupancy i don't know what that came in but maybe that was the impetus for tearing down the school right

121
00:11:48,692 --> 00:11:56,935
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I mean, I just voted for this to be significant because I wanted to pause.

122
00:11:56,995 --> 00:12:05,157
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think there was some good information that was gleaned over the last month with the site visits and with just what you've been able to get so far.

123
00:12:05,197 --> 00:12:10,179
[SPEAKER_13]: But I still don't think that this building, to me, rises the level of perfectly preserved.

124
00:12:10,239 --> 00:12:11,019
[SPEAKER_13]: I just don't see.

125
00:12:14,437 --> 00:12:18,619
[SPEAKER_13]: a big value to really say that this building really should be back.

126
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:20,180
[SPEAKER_13]: The documentation I agree with.

127
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:32,405
[SPEAKER_13]: I think there's a story here that's worth telling and I can see some documentation on this, but I just don't see how this would rise to that level personally based on what I've read and what I've seen on the photos.

128
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:36,186
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

129
00:12:37,267 --> 00:12:38,207
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll go to Kit next.

130
00:12:38,847 --> 00:12:39,848
[SPEAKER_07]: Kit seconded the motion.

131
00:12:41,207 --> 00:12:43,407
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I seconded, so we'd have a second.

132
00:12:43,868 --> 00:12:56,030
[SPEAKER_11]: But I have to say, I find this one really sort of difficult, because I do think that the history of it, while not verified, is really interesting.

133
00:12:56,050 --> 00:13:00,731
[SPEAKER_11]: And it makes me wonder how many schoolhouse buildings there are from that era.

134
00:13:00,751 --> 00:13:02,012
[SPEAKER_11]: You're saying 19th century.

135
00:13:05,054 --> 00:13:08,835
[SPEAKER_11]: that are preserved in Massachusetts, especially that size.

136
00:13:09,715 --> 00:13:14,296
[SPEAKER_11]: And that makes me think, I mean, historically significant for where?

137
00:13:14,997 --> 00:13:18,698
[SPEAKER_11]: For Medford or for Roslindale?

138
00:13:18,718 --> 00:13:28,700
[SPEAKER_11]: And if I was driving by it on Fulton Heights, I think I would think it looks a lot like a lot of other houses in Fulton Heights and so far.

139
00:13:32,943 --> 00:13:39,546
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm waiting to hear from the rest of the architect colleagues on the commission.

140
00:13:43,829 --> 00:13:44,229
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, great.

141
00:13:44,329 --> 00:13:44,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

142
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:47,610
[SPEAKER_07]: Peter, we'll go with you next, I guess.

143
00:13:47,711 --> 00:13:50,952
[SPEAKER_07]: You're the logical next person, and then I'll go to Eleni, who was there.

144
00:13:51,853 --> 00:13:52,173
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

145
00:13:52,753 --> 00:13:54,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I find this one difficult as well.

146
00:14:00,435 --> 00:14:27,511
[SPEAKER_04]: I find that it has potentially an interesting story, and yet I don't find the building itself all that compelling compared to some of the other ones that are great examples of something that would be a big detriment to the city to lose.

147
00:14:29,898 --> 00:14:41,661
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and I think I, although I don't have your level of expertise on the framing, it does seem like at least that first floor framing is quite old.

148
00:14:41,701 --> 00:14:46,723
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see the, some of the beams appear to be hand hewn almost.

149
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:55,705
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I'm kind of on the fence about this one, but I,

150
00:15:00,978 --> 00:15:22,596
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as just a building, if I didn't know it was possibly a schoolhouse, then I think I wouldn't have as much cause to, if I didn't know it had been a potentially moved schoolhouse, then that's kind of like, I feel like the one thing going forward that would recommend it to be preferably preserved for me.

151
00:15:22,776 --> 00:15:26,059
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, I mean,

152
00:15:30,801 --> 00:15:34,624
[SPEAKER_04]: That house would have to be completely refinished on the inside and everything.

153
00:15:35,704 --> 00:15:44,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably to be reused would have to be reinforced a lot, the floor framing and stuff.

154
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:52,394
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure how much, even if it was preserved, I'm not sure how much would be discernible.

155
00:15:54,446 --> 00:16:03,332
[SPEAKER_04]: of it, so I think I'm probably leaning towards no, but it's not a clear-cut one for me.

156
00:16:06,874 --> 00:16:07,054
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

157
00:16:07,254 --> 00:16:07,755
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks, Peter.

158
00:16:08,275 --> 00:16:08,715
[SPEAKER_07]: And Eleni?

159
00:16:09,776 --> 00:16:11,617
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I think it was a tough one, too.

160
00:16:11,717 --> 00:16:22,104
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I think I would think having visited it and seeing it in person kind of makes for a better argument to

161
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:28,214
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, argued for its significance and preferably preserved status.

162
00:16:28,995 --> 00:16:32,598
[SPEAKER_10]: However, it does need a lot of work.

163
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,000
[SPEAKER_10]: There have been a lot of changes.

164
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:44,230
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, I understand, like, the plans of the owner and developer, they want to, you know, expand the site and really use a lot of the space, empty space of the lot.

165
00:16:47,927 --> 00:16:55,633
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I think maybe a thorough documentation and rewriting the Form B to maybe make it a little more accurate.

166
00:16:55,653 --> 00:17:01,779
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have a more accurate sort of like historical record of the house is definitely in order.

167
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:14,870
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if there's a way that if, you know, the owners do decide to demolish it, to save some of like the old floorboards and, you know, some of the,

168
00:17:17,138 --> 00:17:20,320
[SPEAKER_10]: building material that can be used elsewhere for preservation projects.

169
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:20,660
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

170
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:25,123
[SPEAKER_10]: It just seems like such a waste to tear it down.

171
00:17:25,143 --> 00:17:37,410
[SPEAKER_10]: I wonder if they would be open to maybe doing a little bit of architectural salvage and saving some of the doors or the original materials that can be reused elsewhere.

172
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:41,613
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if that's something this commission has ever discussed before.

173
00:17:43,477 --> 00:17:53,381
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we had one project that the owners hired a sort of a company on a Somerville to go in and salvage a bunch of materials.

174
00:17:54,502 --> 00:17:59,704
[SPEAKER_07]: Never wholesale, like they've never completely dismantled the building or anything like that.

175
00:17:59,844 --> 00:18:06,286
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, there will be some thing to save off of the structure.

176
00:18:06,306 --> 00:18:10,188
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, that might, yeah, might be might be neat.

177
00:18:12,018 --> 00:18:12,658
[SPEAKER_07]: To be able to do.

178
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:13,158
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, great.

179
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:14,879
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

180
00:18:14,939 --> 00:18:18,739
[SPEAKER_07]: Next up, we have the public comment portion of the meeting.

181
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:27,421
[SPEAKER_07]: So, what I will suggest is we hear those against demolition and then those for demolition.

182
00:18:28,021 --> 00:18:33,723
[SPEAKER_07]: If anybody just wants to ask general questions, happy to take those 2 as well.

183
00:18:34,043 --> 00:18:34,183
[SPEAKER_07]: And.

184
00:18:35,463 --> 00:18:41,867
[SPEAKER_07]: If we could hold comments for about five minutes max per person, that would be great.

185
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:45,209
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have any comments, just please raise your hand.

186
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:46,030
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll acknowledge you.

187
00:18:49,252 --> 00:18:52,174
[SPEAKER_07]: Starting with those for preservation.

188
00:18:54,816 --> 00:18:56,497
[SPEAKER_08]: And seeing none, we'll go those against.

189
00:19:04,066 --> 00:19:08,227
[SPEAKER_07]: And seeing none, I'm going to say there's no public comment at this time.

190
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:09,547
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll close comments.

191
00:19:09,887 --> 00:19:13,088
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioners, anything else to add to this conversation before we take a vote?

192
00:19:14,209 --> 00:19:18,350
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I saw the Google Pixel 7 try, like, unmuted and then remuted.

193
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:21,530
[SPEAKER_10]: If that person's on their phone, they might not be able to raise their hand.

194
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:22,151
[SPEAKER_07]: There we go.

195
00:19:22,191 --> 00:19:23,511
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, there he goes.

196
00:19:23,551 --> 00:19:23,751
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

197
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:27,412
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll ask to unmute if we'll see if they can.

198
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:30,433
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you hear me?

199
00:19:31,113 --> 00:19:31,853
[SPEAKER_07]: I can hear you, yes.

200
00:19:32,637 --> 00:19:35,499
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, God, I was having flashbacks from the planning board meeting.

201
00:19:35,959 --> 00:19:36,519
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

202
00:19:36,659 --> 00:19:38,420
[SPEAKER_07]: And your name and address for the record, please.

203
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,701
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to raise my hand on this thing.

204
00:19:40,741 --> 00:19:42,943
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm Greg Maynard.

205
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:44,343
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm the builder.

206
00:19:46,384 --> 00:19:58,211
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just wanted to kind of run down real quick on a few of the things that I have regarding the Form B. And so I'm just going to go at it.

207
00:19:58,311 --> 00:19:59,892
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll try to get through it as quickly as I can.

208
00:20:01,247 --> 00:20:10,374
[SPEAKER_06]: So according to the form B, it's a bungalow style house, which is found in many places at Fulton Heights, including Wilson Street.

209
00:20:11,154 --> 00:20:15,177
[SPEAKER_06]: As you guys noted, the house next door is identical.

210
00:20:15,197 --> 00:20:18,360
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also a house across the street that's similar to that.

211
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:31,465
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you look diagonally, there's a house that's the same footprint and looks like the roof was raised on it that looked very similar to it.

212
00:20:38,148 --> 00:20:42,870
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't think it's really a unique characteristic of a house for that area.

213
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:46,192
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I believe they've done it quite a few times

214
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:50,005
[SPEAKER_06]: whoever was building up there used the same floor print.

215
00:20:51,985 --> 00:20:57,347
[SPEAKER_06]: So when we walked through the house, a lot of the originality was gone.

216
00:20:58,167 --> 00:21:10,250
[SPEAKER_06]: My speculation that there was fire damage from the fire in the attic, smoke damage, and obviously water to put the fire out must have ruined a lot of the interior finishes.

217
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:13,331
[SPEAKER_06]: And the house has been gutted.

218
00:21:14,391 --> 00:21:23,133
[SPEAKER_06]: And like you mentioned that there was paneling put back up to cover up, they didn't do any drywall or anything like that.

219
00:21:23,973 --> 00:21:32,896
[SPEAKER_06]: So there aren't any, I disagree with the, there aren't any new or old doors that were there in the original house.

220
00:21:33,356 --> 00:21:38,577
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the one exterior door that's leading up to the attic looked like it was repurposed.

221
00:21:39,397 --> 00:21:42,038
[SPEAKER_06]: But going on with that,

222
00:21:45,473 --> 00:22:05,363
[SPEAKER_06]: The, like Mr. Codd pointed out in the last meeting, it doesn't really make it practical for me to try and save this house, to try and bring it up to a livable dwelling.

223
00:22:05,443 --> 00:22:07,885
[SPEAKER_06]: The roof would need to be removed and plenty of,

224
00:22:09,398 --> 00:22:14,322
[SPEAKER_06]: updates would need to be done, including the floor system in the basement.

225
00:22:15,503 --> 00:22:20,867
[SPEAKER_06]: Those timbers are spread pretty far apart and have to be structurally redone.

226
00:22:20,947 --> 00:22:27,212
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'd be reframing the whole basement floor, going around those timbers that you guys pointed out.

227
00:22:28,193 --> 00:22:32,996
[SPEAKER_06]: And we really don't know what the second floor system looks like.

228
00:22:38,251 --> 00:22:47,816
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, the nature of the house, there hasn't been any historical people that lived there, no events that we can say.

229
00:22:47,896 --> 00:23:01,282
[SPEAKER_06]: So the possibility of it being an old schoolhouse, I don't see any supported evidence that it is, other than the hearsay that somebody said it was possibly moved.

230
00:23:03,384 --> 00:23:06,808
[SPEAKER_06]: The house was owned by Irish immigrants.

231
00:23:06,848 --> 00:23:09,971
[SPEAKER_06]: He was a meatpacker and a laborer, and he had eight kids.

232
00:23:10,532 --> 00:23:19,161
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't see how he could afford to move a school at that time period.

233
00:23:19,201 --> 00:23:20,602
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that would have been a huge feat.

234
00:23:21,663 --> 00:23:21,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Also,

235
00:23:26,048 --> 00:23:30,829
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, with eight kids, I think it would have went for more than three rooms on the first floor.

236
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:37,951
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the attic is just wide open and not a lot of finishes up there.

237
00:23:38,571 --> 00:23:42,012
[SPEAKER_06]: There wasn't even any handrails on the attic staircase or anything.

238
00:23:42,052 --> 00:23:44,513
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a pretty dangerous situation.

239
00:23:44,533 --> 00:23:52,075
[SPEAKER_06]: With that said, I do disagree with the board's

240
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,781
[SPEAKER_06]: binding on the time frame for which the house was built.

241
00:23:57,821 --> 00:24:09,845
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if you look at the plan, the form B, the site plan that was done in 1936 shows that the house was not even there at the time.

242
00:24:10,345 --> 00:24:14,166
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a separate house on the adjacent lot that is no longer there.

243
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,462
[SPEAKER_06]: So it seems like the original owners may have lived there until at least 1936.

244
00:24:18,602 --> 00:24:39,033
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the only other indication to me that this house that we're talking about is the 1950 plot plan that is on the form B. So, I mean, the actual timeframe of when the actual house was constructed is in question.

245
00:24:40,494 --> 00:24:42,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Also the outbuilding,

246
00:24:43,068 --> 00:24:51,035
[SPEAKER_06]: or the garage in the back in 1950, what they show on the plan is completely different than what's there now.

247
00:24:55,138 --> 00:24:58,321
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that building was constructed at the same time as the house.

248
00:24:58,781 --> 00:25:04,245
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got different materials that we used that are inconsistent with what was used in the house.

249
00:25:07,217 --> 00:25:18,900
[SPEAKER_06]: So in going forward or trying to do a rehab or anything on the house, I mean, the cost would just be absorbing it with the square footage of the house.

250
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:21,361
[SPEAKER_06]: It wouldn't make sense.

251
00:25:21,421 --> 00:25:27,482
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the house wouldn't be big enough for me to do a rehab, invest that kind of money, and I'd never get the return on it.

252
00:25:27,822 --> 00:25:29,002
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd be upside down.

253
00:25:29,022 --> 00:25:34,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I'd essentially be saving four walls and a field store violation.

254
00:25:37,705 --> 00:25:59,004
[SPEAKER_06]: So in regards to the board, as far as, you know, the timbers, I mean, I think the biggest question is, is those four timbers are used as a girder in the basement, whether or not where they got them, who knows where they came from, but I'd be more than willing to save those and give them to whoever wanted them.

255
00:26:00,568 --> 00:26:11,757
[SPEAKER_06]: I typically do save timbers like that to use for repurposing of like mantles or if somebody wanted to put a fox beam in their living room or something.

256
00:26:12,198 --> 00:26:13,439
[SPEAKER_06]: We've done that before.

257
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:23,987
[SPEAKER_06]: But as far as my opinion, I don't think this demolition of the building would be detrimental to the historical, cultural, or architectural heritage of the city.

258
00:26:24,488 --> 00:26:25,469
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate your time.

259
00:26:25,489 --> 00:26:25,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.

260
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:27,891
Great.

261
00:26:28,431 --> 00:26:28,972
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. Maynard.

262
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:29,192
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

263
00:26:32,104 --> 00:26:36,908
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Maynard, can I just have your address for the record, just so Peter can put it in with his meeting minutes?

264
00:26:37,048 --> 00:26:37,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I found it.

265
00:26:37,849 --> 00:26:38,950
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on the application.

266
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:40,171
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you got it on the demo application?

267
00:26:40,211 --> 00:26:40,571
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, great.

268
00:26:40,711 --> 00:26:41,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

269
00:26:41,332 --> 00:26:42,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, thanks.

270
00:26:43,313 --> 00:26:45,195
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, commissioners, final thoughts?

271
00:26:48,167 --> 00:26:49,288
[SPEAKER_07]: I will go back to the motion.

272
00:26:49,328 --> 00:26:58,573
[SPEAKER_07]: So the motion on the table is that Doug made a motion to find to 31 Wilson Street, not preferably preserved with no nickels seconding.

273
00:26:58,653 --> 00:27:03,236
[SPEAKER_07]: So a yes vote will mean that it's not preferably preserved.

274
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:05,498
[SPEAKER_07]: And a no vote means that it is preferably preserved.

275
00:27:05,518 --> 00:27:06,338
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's opposite.

276
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:07,339
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I hate doing that.

277
00:27:07,419 --> 00:27:08,920
[SPEAKER_07]: But whatever, we'll do it that way.

278
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:14,683
[SPEAKER_07]: So I will go around as I see you on my zoom call.

279
00:27:14,743 --> 00:27:15,323
[SPEAKER_07]: So Peter?

280
00:27:15,343 --> 00:27:15,404
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

281
00:27:18,857 --> 00:27:38,927
[SPEAKER_07]: and kit yes and eleni yes and doug yes okay four zero all right we are all set so i will get that letter out and uh greg you will be all set we'll release the demo permit when we file that paperwork

282
00:27:42,191 --> 00:27:46,352
[SPEAKER_13]: Ryan, can we make sure we try to get the form be corrected to the best of our ability?

283
00:27:46,372 --> 00:27:52,833
[SPEAKER_13]: I think to build on what Aline said, I think that would be good to make sure we don't let that fall through the cracks.

284
00:27:53,313 --> 00:27:57,734
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I can see if I can send some stuff to John to see if he wants to take a look at it in person.

285
00:27:57,754 --> 00:28:01,695
[SPEAKER_10]: And maybe it's like some appropriate documentation.

286
00:28:03,216 --> 00:28:09,057
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'll see if I can find somebody to do that, having a problem.

287
00:28:11,402 --> 00:28:12,202
[SPEAKER_07]: finding somebody who wasn't.

288
00:28:12,222 --> 00:28:15,204
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm trying to imagine this house making it from Roslindale to Medford.

289
00:28:15,224 --> 00:28:19,585
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean, they would have dismantled it.

290
00:28:19,605 --> 00:28:20,606
[SPEAKER_07]: It wouldn't have come whole.

291
00:28:21,386 --> 00:28:23,007
[SPEAKER_07]: It definitely would not have come whole.

292
00:28:23,247 --> 00:28:27,409
[SPEAKER_07]: It may have come piecemeal.

293
00:28:27,529 --> 00:28:33,711
[SPEAKER_07]: It's 1930s or 40s on the back of a semi or possibly by rail, but unlikely.

294
00:28:34,892 --> 00:28:37,193
[SPEAKER_13]: But you thought it potentially could have been earlier, right?

295
00:28:37,592 --> 00:28:39,032
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the building's definitely earlier.

296
00:28:39,052 --> 00:28:41,993
[SPEAKER_07]: The framing is definitely way earlier than that.

297
00:28:42,013 --> 00:28:55,976
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there's Victorian era, two Victorian era doors, weird floor plan that has some sort of like central entering vestibule, like a double back-to-back parlor, that sort of thing.

298
00:28:56,056 --> 00:28:59,557
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, we'll see what we can do to capture that stuff.

299
00:29:00,838 --> 00:29:02,218
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, next up on the...

300
00:29:03,728 --> 00:29:07,149
[SPEAKER_07]: list for public hearings is for Grove Street, preferably preserved hearing.

301
00:29:07,949 --> 00:29:12,551
[SPEAKER_07]: So just to save ourselves some time, I reiterated the general process.

302
00:29:12,571 --> 00:29:18,193
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is the public hearing section of the process for this property.

303
00:29:19,213 --> 00:29:25,915
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioners, I uploaded the MHC form B to the public hearing.

304
00:29:27,238 --> 00:29:36,525
[SPEAKER_07]: to the Google Drive, so it's there, so I'll entertain a motion and then to get the discussion on the table, hear your thoughts, then we'll go to public comments, and then we'll come back and circle back.

305
00:29:38,626 --> 00:29:43,710
[SPEAKER_07]: And just so you guys know, the owners and their architects representative are here.

306
00:29:47,793 --> 00:29:52,476
[SPEAKER_07]: So a motion for or against preferential reserve status for Four Grove.

307
00:30:01,112 --> 00:30:06,395
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd make a motion for preferably preserve for this building for 4 Grove Street.

308
00:30:09,497 --> 00:30:12,259
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Peter and a 2nd.

309
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:13,780
[SPEAKER_08]: 2nd.

310
00:30:17,963 --> 00:30:19,984
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, Peter, you start comments.

311
00:30:24,387 --> 00:30:25,267
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like this is a.

312
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:37,990
[SPEAKER_04]: A prominent house, it commands a very important corner of the street, Grove Street and High Street.

313
00:30:38,931 --> 00:30:45,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Similar houses, we have found preferably preserved just up the street.

314
00:30:46,037 --> 00:30:52,103
[SPEAKER_04]: I forget the number, the gentleman's house, but very similar property.

315
00:30:55,706 --> 00:31:04,996
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it, although it's been denuded of some of its detail, there's still a lot in existence, too.

316
00:31:06,617 --> 00:31:07,458
[SPEAKER_04]: I did have a question.

317
00:31:07,658 --> 00:31:11,202
[SPEAKER_04]: What was the base of the porch originally?

318
00:31:11,222 --> 00:31:11,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we know?

319
00:31:12,642 --> 00:31:17,746
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so there was a picture during reconstruction before this project.

320
00:31:17,786 --> 00:31:18,426
[SPEAKER_07]: It was wood.

321
00:31:20,147 --> 00:31:25,231
[SPEAKER_07]: There was no extant stone underneath that.

322
00:31:25,311 --> 00:31:33,076
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever was there was gone in a prior renovation that you can see on Google Street View.

323
00:31:33,096 --> 00:31:36,919
[SPEAKER_04]: So we don't have any evidence that it was ever stone?

324
00:31:43,713 --> 00:31:50,041
[SPEAKER_07]: You can keep talking and bring up that, and I will see if I can find my historic images.

325
00:31:50,221 --> 00:31:53,565
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just a point of curiosity.

326
00:31:56,469 --> 00:32:00,334
[SPEAKER_04]: So, not exactly sure what happened with the demolition, but

327
00:32:03,405 --> 00:32:19,828
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this, this housing is this very prominent porch would be worth looking at and hopefully restoring to its former beauty grace.

328
00:32:19,908 --> 00:32:25,369
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why I'm, I'm in favor of preferably preserved status.

329
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:27,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

330
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:29,150
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Peter.

331
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:30,771
[SPEAKER_07]: And Eleni.

332
00:32:32,131 --> 00:32:32,931
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I am.

333
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:34,630
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree with Peter.

334
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:42,292
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the house has similar characteristics to other houses around it.

335
00:32:42,512 --> 00:32:48,633
[SPEAKER_10]: I think any demolition or major change would really alter the streetscape.

336
00:32:48,674 --> 00:32:55,475
[SPEAKER_10]: And the fact that it's on such a prominent corner, I think, bolsters the argument for preferably preserved.

337
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:03,057
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't really have much else to add on top of what Peter said.

338
00:33:03,953 --> 00:33:05,694
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that I agree with him?

339
00:33:09,518 --> 00:33:09,858
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

340
00:33:16,623 --> 00:33:18,805
[SPEAKER_11]: To me, it's sort of clearly preferably preserved.

341
00:33:18,845 --> 00:33:20,767
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't really have much to add other than that.

342
00:33:21,547 --> 00:33:30,535
[SPEAKER_11]: And it looks from earlier photos that the stairs were brick, but it's hard to tell what the base of the original porch was because it looks like it was sided.

343
00:33:33,343 --> 00:33:38,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's gone through a bunch of different incarnations over time.

344
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:47,596
[SPEAKER_07]: The one picture that I have of the delta there does not really show, it definitely is not

345
00:33:48,805 --> 00:33:56,987
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, definitely not stone, uh, but it's, um, you know, it could have been built and it's just gone through a bunch of different incarnations, but, uh, the wood is there now.

346
00:33:57,047 --> 00:34:07,450
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course the, um, there was no, you know, at least the, whatever was there, if it was anything stone, it's went away a long time ago before, before this current incarnation.

347
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:09,611
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

348
00:34:10,111 --> 00:34:10,411
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, Doug.

349
00:34:11,811 --> 00:34:17,193
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I agree with most of the comments, my commissioners, the, not just on the corner, but the commanding with the,

350
00:34:17,957 --> 00:34:23,219
[SPEAKER_13]: With the park in front of it, this building has a unique setting that is as few in the city has.

351
00:34:24,099 --> 00:34:25,159
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think, um.

352
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:29,881
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, there's a lot of really solid and great buildings on growth street and I think.

353
00:34:30,861 --> 00:34:34,402
[SPEAKER_13]: I think until this 1 was was was stripped there.

354
00:34:34,422 --> 00:34:37,123
[SPEAKER_13]: It was 1 of them, but I think I think that we should.

355
00:34:37,883 --> 00:34:42,144
[SPEAKER_13]: Do our best to try to bring it back to the degree we can to the.

356
00:34:44,491 --> 00:34:47,955
[SPEAKER_13]: What it was to before that's my general thought.

357
00:34:49,057 --> 00:34:52,741
[SPEAKER_07]: Great Jen, do you want to comment on this property?

358
00:34:54,824 --> 00:34:56,166
[SPEAKER_07]: Before I move to public comment.

359
00:34:56,186 --> 00:35:02,454
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, no, I don't have anything else to add other than what the commissioners have already said.

360
00:35:06,907 --> 00:35:29,301
[SPEAKER_07]: So I will go to public comment now, get those speaking for demolition to speak first, those against demolition to speak second, and welcome at this time the homeowner and his architect to speak if you guys want to kick off the public comments.

361
00:35:31,202 --> 00:35:32,443
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have to, but you're welcome to.

362
00:35:33,499 --> 00:35:34,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Appreciate it.

363
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:37,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Peter Lewandowski from LR designs were the architects on the project.

364
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:52,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I let you just to reinforce the board that, um, the little overzealous reaction to rebuilding the deck was a reaction to the building department asking to reframe the structure because of the rotting framing members.

365
00:35:53,144 --> 00:36:03,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and it was the process of restoring it was kind of went in the wrong direction, but we plan on going back and repairing everything to the original condition of the porch.

366
00:36:04,286 --> 00:36:12,570
[SPEAKER_02]: The siding, the columns, the railings, basically all the details that you have seen in the Google Maps will be restored back to that condition.

367
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:21,574
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing that we do ask the board is on the side facing High Street to add a stair to get to the yard so you don't have to walk all the way around the front.

368
00:36:22,374 --> 00:36:27,477
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there are stairs in the front that are brick that are not in great condition.

369
00:36:27,537 --> 00:36:35,141
[SPEAKER_02]: We like to replace those with a traditional more wooden stair in the same baluster detail that's on the existing house.

370
00:36:36,382 --> 00:36:40,464
[SPEAKER_02]: So our intent is to basically restore the front porch to its original condition.

371
00:36:43,446 --> 00:36:44,446
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, thank you.

372
00:36:47,148 --> 00:36:47,988
[SPEAKER_08]: Other public comments?

373
00:36:49,529 --> 00:36:51,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Sir, what was your address again?

374
00:36:52,859 --> 00:36:53,099
[SPEAKER_02]: Mine?

375
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

376
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,902
[SPEAKER_02]: 64 Alston Street, Suite 3, Cambridge.

377
00:36:58,823 --> 00:36:59,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

378
00:37:07,408 --> 00:37:07,849
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

379
00:37:07,889 --> 00:37:12,652
[SPEAKER_07]: Seeing no hands raised, I'm going to go ahead and close public comments.

380
00:37:14,133 --> 00:37:19,076
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioners, do you have anything else to add to this conversation before we wrap it up?

381
00:37:22,002 --> 00:37:28,648
[SPEAKER_04]: I would just say, um, one for the comments, uh, I'm really heartened to hear what you said.

382
00:37:29,109 --> 00:37:36,655
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, um, I look forward to getting you off of this demolition delay as soon as we can.

383
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:45,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Once we see that if you can provide us with the drawings of what it's going to look like, or some kind of, um,

384
00:37:47,545 --> 00:37:58,906
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, this new stairway and stuff off the side, then we can try to get this moving quickly, I think, if we vote for it to be preferably preserved, that is.

385
00:37:59,948 --> 00:38:00,349
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.

386
00:38:01,442 --> 00:38:09,007
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess one other question I had is our other, the porch was obviously the major, I think the major concern.

387
00:38:09,708 --> 00:38:11,068
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that's been addressed.

388
00:38:11,148 --> 00:38:12,029
[SPEAKER_13]: What about the siding?

389
00:38:12,049 --> 00:38:18,053
[SPEAKER_13]: Were there other issues that the members of the board have when we looked at it a month ago, when we looked at it?

390
00:38:18,113 --> 00:38:23,617
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't recall the details of the conversation because we have so many before us each week.

391
00:38:23,737 --> 00:38:26,058
[SPEAKER_13]: Were there other concerns beyond the porch?

392
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:28,200
[SPEAKER_07]: Stucco.

393
00:38:30,565 --> 00:38:40,790
[SPEAKER_07]: And most of that work, I believe is, Peter, correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe most of that work is either ongoing or done on the outside, other than the board.

394
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:44,631
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, unfortunately, the budget, we would have liked to strip it.

395
00:38:45,092 --> 00:38:46,872
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my vote.

396
00:38:47,072 --> 00:38:49,734
[SPEAKER_02]: But unfortunately, the stucco was left.

397
00:38:50,134 --> 00:38:51,154
[SPEAKER_02]: It was in pretty good shape.

398
00:38:51,194 --> 00:38:56,436
[SPEAKER_02]: We patched areas that we could, and we painted it, basically, kind of keeping the same character of what it was.

399
00:38:57,777 --> 00:38:59,638
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, stucco is a, is there wood underneath there?

400
00:39:00,859 --> 00:39:02,320
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe there's enough thicknesses.

401
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:06,264
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't do too much investigation, but I believe there is collaborative siding underneath there.

402
00:39:06,284 --> 00:39:11,188
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm sure there's a lot of interesting things that are buried, unfortunately.

403
00:39:11,969 --> 00:39:20,536
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Medford went through a period of stucco like the 1910s and 20s, so it's not surprising.

404
00:39:21,417 --> 00:39:23,338
[SPEAKER_07]: But it itself is sort of historic now.

405
00:39:24,369 --> 00:39:38,307
[SPEAKER_00]: Ryan, one comment that I would like to make, since I practically drive by this house every day, going to and from wherever I'm going, the two dormers that were added, the siding does not match.

406
00:39:39,523 --> 00:39:45,848
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so they put some modern siding on there versus the stucco that's on the rest of the exterior.

407
00:39:45,908 --> 00:39:51,431
[SPEAKER_00]: So that might be something that the subcommittee want, um, you know, if it goes.

408
00:39:51,451 --> 00:39:59,957
[SPEAKER_00]: Under preferably reserved, and this goes to subcommittee for discussion on how to move forward on the delay might be something the group wants to discuss.

409
00:40:03,019 --> 00:40:03,119
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

410
00:40:05,309 --> 00:40:06,190
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll take a look at pictures.

411
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:11,834
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it might be wise for the subcommittee to make a field visit, too, just to get a sense of the building.

412
00:40:12,895 --> 00:40:13,996
[SPEAKER_07]: So, okay.

413
00:40:15,277 --> 00:40:17,078
[SPEAKER_07]: Any other comments before I move to a vote?

414
00:40:17,098 --> 00:40:19,620
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, moving to a vote.

415
00:40:19,701 --> 00:40:27,006
[SPEAKER_07]: A motion was made by Peter to find for significance, seconded by Kit, right?

416
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,461
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it was Eleni, sorry.

417
00:40:32,561 --> 00:40:35,464
[SPEAKER_00]: Point of clarification, Ryan, it's preferably preserved.

418
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:37,145
[SPEAKER_00]: I am assuming not significance.

419
00:40:38,146 --> 00:40:38,706
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, sorry.

420
00:40:39,307 --> 00:40:43,410
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that Peter made a motion to find for preferably preserved status.

421
00:40:45,552 --> 00:40:47,013
[SPEAKER_07]: And Eleni seconded.

422
00:40:47,033 --> 00:40:50,816
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll go around as I see you.

423
00:40:50,876 --> 00:40:51,196
[SPEAKER_07]: Peter?

424
00:40:52,597 --> 00:40:52,937
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

425
00:40:54,279 --> 00:40:54,779
[SPEAKER_07]: And Kit?

426
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,060
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

427
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:57,161
[SPEAKER_07]: And Eleni?

428
00:40:57,801 --> 00:40:58,022
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

429
00:40:58,602 --> 00:40:58,942
[SPEAKER_07]: And Doug?

430
00:40:59,383 --> 00:40:59,603
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

431
00:41:00,644 --> 00:41:03,846
[SPEAKER_07]: And Jen, yes, great.

432
00:41:04,546 --> 00:41:04,786
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

433
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:10,009
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes 5 to 0. so we will get you the documentation.

434
00:41:10,029 --> 00:41:11,510
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll put you in touch with the.

435
00:41:13,612 --> 00:41:25,855
[SPEAKER_07]: The subcommittee and if you guys want to meet with them, usually it's over zoom just to review plans where you guys were at with the design and then see if there's any changes necessary.

436
00:41:25,895 --> 00:41:27,535
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we'll bring it back to the board next month.

437
00:41:28,495 --> 00:41:30,196
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you guys can get it done in 30 days.

438
00:41:30,216 --> 00:41:32,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, great.

439
00:41:33,096 --> 00:41:36,677
[SPEAKER_02]: And then will they contact me Mr. Hayward or should I contact?

440
00:41:37,321 --> 00:41:38,062
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I will.

441
00:41:38,382 --> 00:41:42,366
[SPEAKER_07]: If you send us the plans, I'll forward them to you and I'll loop you in on that.

442
00:41:43,086 --> 00:41:43,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic.

443
00:41:44,408 --> 00:41:44,608
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

444
00:41:45,168 --> 00:41:45,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

445
00:41:45,809 --> 00:41:46,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.

446
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:47,110
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you all.

447
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:48,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Appreciate your time.

448
00:41:51,177 --> 00:41:58,959
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, next up, the commission will resume its regular meeting with new business 26 Rockwell, the determination of significance.

449
00:41:59,679 --> 00:42:04,040
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioners, I sent around the MHC form B on the Google Drive.

450
00:42:05,301 --> 00:42:11,622
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll entertain a motion for, again, significance for this property.

451
00:42:11,642 --> 00:42:18,064
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, John.

452
00:42:18,628 --> 00:42:22,570
[SPEAKER_00]: Ryan, I'll make a motion to fine for significance on 26 Rockwell Avenue.

453
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:24,130
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thank you.

454
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:24,951
[SPEAKER_07]: And a second?

455
00:42:29,812 --> 00:42:30,373
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll second.

456
00:42:31,373 --> 00:42:34,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I saw Doug, but I'll give it to Doug.

457
00:42:34,654 --> 00:42:35,315
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw it.

458
00:42:35,355 --> 00:42:35,855
[SPEAKER_10]: That's fine.

459
00:42:36,195 --> 00:42:36,955
[SPEAKER_10]: I got the last one.

460
00:42:36,975 --> 00:42:38,216
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

461
00:42:38,876 --> 00:42:40,857
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, Jen, if you want to kickstart the conversation.

462
00:42:41,888 --> 00:42:42,148
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

463
00:42:43,189 --> 00:42:45,492
[SPEAKER_00]: I found the Form B extremely interesting.

464
00:42:45,512 --> 00:42:53,200
[SPEAKER_00]: I think at first glance, you see this tiny little bungalow and you're like, oh, this isn't anything overly interesting.

465
00:42:53,300 --> 00:43:00,287
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you read about the concrete block construction, I found that kind of fascinating.

466
00:43:00,307 --> 00:43:03,170
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think in the time I've been on the commission, I have not

467
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:06,051
[SPEAKER_00]: seen anything like this come before us.

468
00:43:07,211 --> 00:43:25,416
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that coupled with the recommendation by the consultant that it could contribute to a historic district, or excuse me, a listing in the National Register, to me, certainly warrants to be found at least significant for tonight's discussion.

469
00:43:25,976 --> 00:43:26,856
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will leave it at that.

470
00:43:28,237 --> 00:43:28,857
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, Doug.

471
00:43:32,413 --> 00:43:35,774
[SPEAKER_13]: I agree with a lot of what Jen said.

472
00:43:35,854 --> 00:43:39,395
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not quite as strong on this.

473
00:43:39,455 --> 00:43:40,756
[SPEAKER_13]: The block is unique.

474
00:43:40,796 --> 00:43:43,957
[SPEAKER_13]: You're not wrong about that, Jen, but I didn't think it was enough.

475
00:43:43,997 --> 00:43:50,299
[SPEAKER_13]: But I'm willing to kind of, I think, pause this process and do a little bit more digging.

476
00:43:50,339 --> 00:43:51,659
[SPEAKER_13]: I would like to see the inside.

477
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:54,760
[SPEAKER_13]: I would like to visit the house and look at it personally.

478
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,021
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, the photos are obviously taken during the dead winter.

479
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:00,421
[SPEAKER_13]: And just to look at it a little closer, because I agree with Jen.

480
00:44:00,441 --> 00:44:01,962
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think there is many like this.

481
00:44:02,842 --> 00:44:05,744
[SPEAKER_13]: And bungalows are kind of disappearing slowly but surely in the city.

482
00:44:05,884 --> 00:44:08,165
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we've seen that a lot.

483
00:44:08,285 --> 00:44:13,867
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm not quite as gung ho as Jen, but I certainly think it's worth a pause here.

484
00:44:16,069 --> 00:44:16,229
Great.

485
00:44:16,749 --> 00:44:16,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks.

486
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:18,890
[SPEAKER_07]: Eleni, we'll go to you next.

487
00:44:21,151 --> 00:44:24,312
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think I agree with Jen.

488
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,611
[SPEAKER_10]: I just think this house is incredibly unique.

489
00:44:28,651 --> 00:44:36,794
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, yes, it's a bungalow, but the types of materials used and like it's just state of preservation, at least from the photographs, looks quite good.

490
00:44:38,014 --> 00:44:45,017
[SPEAKER_10]: It would be nice to do like a site visit and look at the interior as well to see if that holds up as well as the exterior.

491
00:44:45,077 --> 00:44:48,538
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm, you know, leaning towards significance.

492
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:51,259
Thanks.

493
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:52,580
[SPEAKER_07]: And Ken?

494
00:44:55,447 --> 00:44:56,247
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I'm with Jen.

495
00:44:56,468 --> 00:44:59,749
[SPEAKER_11]: I found this in a very interesting building.

496
00:45:00,149 --> 00:45:16,358
[SPEAKER_11]: And the idea that it was somewhere in the Form B that it perhaps was an example of the building materials and construction of the owners as sort of an advertisement, really interesting.

497
00:45:17,478 --> 00:45:21,400
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know of another building like this one in Medford or anywhere, actually.

498
00:45:23,501 --> 00:45:23,721
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

499
00:45:24,462 --> 00:45:24,862
[SPEAKER_08]: And Peter?

500
00:45:26,312 --> 00:45:30,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I found the, well, let me rephrase that.

501
00:45:30,755 --> 00:45:42,223
[SPEAKER_04]: While I found the story of the house and the materials and everything compelling, I find the architecture of the house itself less compelling.

502
00:45:45,685 --> 00:45:52,289
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think the story is more interesting than the product, but

503
00:45:54,530 --> 00:45:56,151
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's where I'm coming down on it.

504
00:45:58,313 --> 00:45:58,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

505
00:46:02,375 --> 00:46:02,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

506
00:46:05,357 --> 00:46:10,641
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll add two things to this story, because I think this is a good teachable moment for the commissioners.

507
00:46:11,362 --> 00:46:16,605
[SPEAKER_07]: So concrete block houses are extremely rare in this community.

508
00:46:16,725 --> 00:46:20,328
[SPEAKER_07]: So out of this one,

509
00:46:20,928 --> 00:46:23,449
[SPEAKER_07]: there is an identical house next door, I believe.

510
00:46:23,809 --> 00:46:25,809
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's not just this one by itself.

511
00:46:25,869 --> 00:46:27,830
[SPEAKER_07]: There's two, I think, side by side.

512
00:46:28,570 --> 00:46:30,930
[SPEAKER_07]: There's probably 10 of these in the entire city.

513
00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:36,052
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a handful of them that have reached full two stories.

514
00:46:36,112 --> 00:46:39,872
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a couple in South Medford near Magoon Square.

515
00:46:39,972 --> 00:46:45,054
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, it's kind of interesting to see these products.

516
00:46:45,734 --> 00:46:50,335
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, John Clemson is completely right that they had these sort of

517
00:46:51,375 --> 00:47:08,747
[SPEAKER_07]: machines that would churn out these blocks but for all of the concrete block garages that are out there that are like a lesser quality material you've probably heard the expression a cinder block and so cinder blocks are literally the product of

518
00:47:10,288 --> 00:47:20,861
[SPEAKER_07]: the railroad industry and a way for railroads to figure out a creative and sort of economical way to dispose of railroad waste ash from their steam engines.

519
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:24,685
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the 1930s, so it's still the golden era of steam.

520
00:47:25,346 --> 00:47:25,967
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's why

521
00:47:26,567 --> 00:47:48,002
[SPEAKER_07]: uh they're produced and called cinder blocks because they are literally made from the ash of trains and mixed with concrete and they're usually cheap and sometimes frail which is why now after 70 years of being outside a lot of these concrete block garages are failing um but you know usually the higher quality materials those that are actually used to build houses um

522
00:47:49,843 --> 00:47:55,747
[SPEAKER_07]: are made by a higher quality Portland cement product that then can stand the test of time.

523
00:47:55,767 --> 00:47:59,689
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems like this building certainly has weathered well for its age.

524
00:48:03,771 --> 00:48:14,798
[SPEAKER_07]: With that said, we have a motion on the table for significance made by Jen, Doug seconded, so I'll go around as I see you, starting with Peter.

525
00:48:16,179 --> 00:48:16,339
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

526
00:48:19,098 --> 00:48:19,358
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

527
00:48:20,239 --> 00:48:20,760
[SPEAKER_07]: And Kit?

528
00:48:21,701 --> 00:48:21,981
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

529
00:48:23,142 --> 00:48:23,603
[SPEAKER_07]: And Eleni?

530
00:48:24,184 --> 00:48:24,424
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

531
00:48:26,286 --> 00:48:26,746
[SPEAKER_07]: And Jen?

532
00:48:27,467 --> 00:48:27,788
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

533
00:48:28,528 --> 00:48:28,929
[SPEAKER_07]: And Doug?

534
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:30,531
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

535
00:48:31,632 --> 00:48:31,732
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

536
00:48:33,292 --> 00:48:35,835
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, motion passes 4 to 1.

537
00:48:36,836 --> 00:48:43,544
[SPEAKER_07]: So I will get that paperwork out to the homeowner with the letter of significance and will do the legal ad.

538
00:48:43,684 --> 00:48:50,872
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there's a signage requirement that we have to, uh, that they have to post in order to have the public hearing, which will be next month on March 10.

539
00:48:53,065 --> 00:48:58,810
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, next up we have 76 Court Street determination of significance commissioners again.

540
00:48:58,890 --> 00:49:02,614
[SPEAKER_07]: I posted the MHC form B in the Google Drive.

541
00:49:02,874 --> 00:49:03,815
[SPEAKER_07]: I will entertain a motion.

542
00:49:10,701 --> 00:49:14,044
[SPEAKER_00]: I will make a motion to find for significance at 76 Court Street.

543
00:49:18,688 --> 00:49:19,128
[SPEAKER_08]: And a second.

544
00:49:25,582 --> 00:49:26,043
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll second.

545
00:49:26,063 --> 00:49:30,569
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, Jen, you want to start?

546
00:49:33,253 --> 00:49:38,695
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, I thoroughly read the Form B here, and I think a couple of things stood out to me.

547
00:49:39,375 --> 00:49:41,855
[SPEAKER_00]: One was the age itself.

548
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:48,717
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly, it's one of pushing towards that pre-1875 age.

549
00:49:49,178 --> 00:49:52,679
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that alone is enough to warrant significance.

550
00:49:53,059 --> 00:50:00,061
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, I found the story of the architecture very interesting, especially the comment from our

551
00:50:01,201 --> 00:50:16,233
[SPEAKER_00]: consultant that said that, you know, the L's and some of the things that I think at the surface would appear to be add-ons of a later time are actually not and that they're part of the original structure of the home.

552
00:50:17,494 --> 00:50:29,103
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just thought that kind of detail and certainly, you know, the beautiful columns on the front and, you know, the significance that it plays on the street is enough to warrant for significance in my opinion.

553
00:50:31,462 --> 00:50:32,423
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks and Lenny.

554
00:50:37,086 --> 00:50:43,530
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I think after reading the form be, you know, again, the age really stood out to me.

555
00:50:43,550 --> 00:50:43,610
[SPEAKER_10]: And

556
00:50:47,122 --> 00:50:52,266
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, although it does look like there have been additions, I still think the original essence of the building is there.

557
00:50:52,286 --> 00:50:54,067
[SPEAKER_10]: It's hard to tell from that one photograph.

558
00:50:54,747 --> 00:51:02,313
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think between the historical research and the age of the building, that's enough to me to determine significance.

559
00:51:04,594 --> 00:51:04,754
Great.

560
00:51:06,395 --> 00:51:07,056
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'll go to Kit.

561
00:51:11,699 --> 00:51:15,302
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I think it's significant as well.

562
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,043
[SPEAKER_11]: age and the architecture.

563
00:51:22,445 --> 00:51:22,746
[SPEAKER_08]: And Doug?

564
00:51:24,407 --> 00:51:25,629
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I concur.

565
00:51:25,709 --> 00:51:35,380
[SPEAKER_13]: The columns in the front, the presence and the age, I really think it would be a loss for this building to be toward the auto demo for sure.

566
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:36,981
[SPEAKER_13]: Great.

567
00:51:37,362 --> 00:51:37,802
[SPEAKER_04]: And Peter?

568
00:51:38,803 --> 00:51:39,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing to add.

569
00:51:43,629 --> 00:51:47,634
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, motion's been made and seconded to find for significance.

570
00:51:47,694 --> 00:51:50,457
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll go around as I see you, Peter?

571
00:51:51,619 --> 00:51:51,959
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

572
00:51:53,041 --> 00:51:53,461
[SPEAKER_07]: And Kit?

573
00:51:54,342 --> 00:51:54,622
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

574
00:51:55,243 --> 00:51:55,684
[SPEAKER_07]: And Eleni?

575
00:51:56,385 --> 00:51:56,625
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

576
00:51:57,445 --> 00:51:57,885
[SPEAKER_07]: And Jen?

577
00:51:58,565 --> 00:51:58,846
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

578
00:51:59,546 --> 00:51:59,846
[SPEAKER_07]: And Doug?

579
00:52:00,306 --> 00:52:00,546
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

580
00:52:01,226 --> 00:52:02,427
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, motion passes 5-0.

581
00:52:02,867 --> 00:52:08,409
[SPEAKER_07]: So we will have a public hearing next month, just like we did today for the other two properties.

582
00:52:09,509 --> 00:52:12,950
[SPEAKER_07]: And there'll be a signage requirement and a legal notice posted.

583
00:52:13,710 --> 00:52:18,632
[SPEAKER_07]: And we will be in touch with the owner and get them, get them out and get them to the table.

584
00:52:20,568 --> 00:52:26,172
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, next up we have 115 Emerald Street, a determination of significance.

585
00:52:26,432 --> 00:52:34,297
[SPEAKER_07]: So commissioners, we don't have enough information to make a determination tonight.

586
00:52:34,417 --> 00:52:37,439
[SPEAKER_07]: So I wondered if we could pass on review.

587
00:52:37,459 --> 00:52:43,963
[SPEAKER_07]: I know we sent over this information, but the consultants were completely swamped with everything else we gave them.

588
00:52:44,103 --> 00:52:48,646
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm hoping to just pass on review on this one.

589
00:52:51,238 --> 00:53:00,164
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't think we have a choice except to pass on review because we're coming up on the time deadline to give them their hearing.

590
00:53:00,325 --> 00:53:05,969
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I think it's just a pass on review and that's that.

591
00:53:09,251 --> 00:53:10,131
[SPEAKER_07]: Any further discussion?

592
00:53:11,693 --> 00:53:12,493
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll entertain a motion.

593
00:53:13,374 --> 00:53:17,597
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll make a motion to pass on review for 115 Emerald Street.

594
00:53:17,617 --> 00:53:19,078
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, and a second.

595
00:53:23,592 --> 00:53:23,872
[SPEAKER_00]: Second.

596
00:53:24,773 --> 00:53:25,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Lenny.

597
00:53:27,814 --> 00:53:28,995
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, go around, Peter.

598
00:53:30,176 --> 00:53:30,556
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

599
00:53:31,396 --> 00:53:31,836
[SPEAKER_08]: And Kit.

600
00:53:34,378 --> 00:53:34,658
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

601
00:53:36,059 --> 00:53:36,519
[SPEAKER_08]: And Lenny.

602
00:53:37,059 --> 00:53:37,199
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

603
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:38,460
[SPEAKER_08]: And Jen.

604
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:39,240
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

605
00:53:39,901 --> 00:53:40,341
[SPEAKER_08]: And Doug.

606
00:53:42,082 --> 00:53:42,322
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

607
00:53:44,442 --> 00:53:47,303
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes 5-0, so we'll get that paperwork out to the owners.

608
00:53:48,463 --> 00:53:50,704
[SPEAKER_07]: Next up, we have 19 Curtis Street.

609
00:53:50,724 --> 00:53:52,645
[SPEAKER_07]: We're gonna receive the demolition application.

610
00:53:52,725 --> 00:53:54,666
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioners, it's on the Google Drive, I sent it out.

611
00:53:55,366 --> 00:53:57,286
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll entertain a motion to approve this.

612
00:54:03,729 --> 00:54:10,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to receive the application demolition, demolition application, excuse me.

613
00:54:12,525 --> 00:54:14,607
[SPEAKER_04]: What does Ed say as to form?

614
00:54:15,287 --> 00:54:16,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, yes.

615
00:54:17,609 --> 00:54:18,569
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll second that.

616
00:54:18,930 --> 00:54:23,113
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll second the motion to receive the application for 19 Carter Street.

617
00:54:24,073 --> 00:54:24,333
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

618
00:54:24,854 --> 00:54:25,054
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

619
00:54:25,074 --> 00:54:26,415
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll go around as I see you, Peter.

620
00:54:27,576 --> 00:54:27,856
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

621
00:54:29,317 --> 00:54:29,577
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

622
00:54:30,558 --> 00:54:31,018
[SPEAKER_07]: And Lenny.

623
00:54:31,619 --> 00:54:31,859
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

624
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:33,320
[SPEAKER_07]: And Jen.

625
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:34,261
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

626
00:54:34,821 --> 00:54:35,261
[SPEAKER_07]: And Doug.

627
00:54:35,722 --> 00:54:35,922
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

628
00:54:36,770 --> 00:54:38,071
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, 5-0 approved.

629
00:54:39,452 --> 00:54:44,175
[SPEAKER_07]: I already have an MHC inventory form in the works for this building, so next month.

630
00:54:47,296 --> 00:54:49,838
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's all set.

631
00:54:49,858 --> 00:54:52,720
[SPEAKER_07]: 122-124 Woodruff Avenue.

632
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:56,082
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to receive the demolition application.

633
00:54:57,062 --> 00:55:02,125
[SPEAKER_00]: Ryan, I'm going to recuse myself from this one since the applicant is an agent in my office.

634
00:55:02,866 --> 00:55:06,188
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to mute myself and turn off my camera until this is done.

635
00:55:08,502 --> 00:55:15,986
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a reminder.

636
00:55:16,126 --> 00:55:16,226
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

637
00:55:16,247 --> 00:55:16,267
[SPEAKER_07]: 122-124.

638
00:55:16,287 --> 00:55:18,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner, I'll entertain a motion to receive the application.

639
00:55:20,289 --> 00:55:21,790
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll move to receive the application.

640
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:25,892
[SPEAKER_08]: And a second?

641
00:55:28,653 --> 00:55:29,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

642
00:55:29,734 --> 00:55:29,874
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

643
00:55:35,677 --> 00:55:36,538
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, going around.

644
00:55:36,638 --> 00:55:36,818
[SPEAKER_07]: Peter?

645
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:38,660
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

646
00:55:39,801 --> 00:55:40,202
[SPEAKER_07]: And Ken?

647
00:55:40,642 --> 00:55:40,882
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

648
00:55:41,763 --> 00:55:42,223
[SPEAKER_07]: And Lenny?

649
00:55:42,243 --> 00:55:42,984
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

650
00:55:43,845 --> 00:55:44,225
[SPEAKER_07]: And Doug?

651
00:55:44,845 --> 00:55:45,106
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

652
00:55:46,026 --> 00:55:47,908
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, 4-0 passed.

653
00:55:48,829 --> 00:56:01,039
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to, I will allocate funding for an MHC Form B. Usually there's a standing order, so unless you guys feel the need to approve it, I'll just go ahead and order a form for this for next month.

654
00:56:08,816 --> 00:56:11,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Last up is 53 Winford Way.

655
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:15,883
[SPEAKER_07]: We did receive the application for demo for this one.

656
00:56:18,646 --> 00:56:20,729
[SPEAKER_07]: It straddles the line.

657
00:56:21,009 --> 00:56:26,555
[SPEAKER_07]: This is one of those rare cases where the house, you can actually live in one town and sleep in the other.

658
00:56:29,286 --> 00:56:38,994
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd also like to point out that this is a 1950 construction, so it is literally on the line of being reviewable or not.

659
00:56:42,937 --> 00:56:46,279
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually would like to make a motion that we pass on review on this one.

660
00:56:46,299 --> 00:56:54,746
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, motion to pass on review.

661
00:56:54,946 --> 00:56:55,447
[SPEAKER_08]: And a second?

662
00:56:57,789 --> 00:56:58,209
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll second.

663
00:56:59,306 --> 00:57:03,147
[SPEAKER_07]: I think 2nd discussion.

664
00:57:03,167 --> 00:57:06,589
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to discuss do we want to review?

665
00:57:06,689 --> 00:57:07,629
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we not want to review?

666
00:57:08,349 --> 00:57:10,790
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'll chime in on my reasoning again.

667
00:57:10,810 --> 00:57:21,094
[SPEAKER_00]: I think because it was built in 1950, it's right on the line and it looks like a very traditional standard Cape that doesn't appear to be anything.

668
00:57:22,554 --> 00:57:24,475
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting or spectacular on the surface.

669
00:57:25,695 --> 00:57:25,915
[SPEAKER_00]: And.

670
00:57:29,358 --> 00:57:32,780
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'll just leave it at that.

671
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:35,982
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's quite a large building being proposed to take its place.

672
00:57:37,523 --> 00:57:41,005
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it just seems like a better use of the lot, frankly.

673
00:57:41,025 --> 00:57:45,328
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I can't imagine them be finding that building significant, personally.

674
00:57:46,503 --> 00:57:50,124
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there's there's other there's wetlands in the back.

675
00:57:50,164 --> 00:57:58,807
[SPEAKER_07]: So whatever, whatever is being proposed will need to be reviewed by the whoever's conservation commission.

676
00:57:58,867 --> 00:58:00,188
[SPEAKER_07]: It technically is in Medford.

677
00:58:01,428 --> 00:58:04,990
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think Medford's cons comm will probably get it but it could be Winchester.

678
00:58:05,490 --> 00:58:06,650
[SPEAKER_07]: So or maybe Ryan.

679
00:58:07,450 --> 00:58:08,271
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

680
00:58:08,711 --> 00:58:09,311
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I can.

681
00:58:09,511 --> 00:58:10,131
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

682
00:58:10,371 --> 00:58:11,212
[SPEAKER_01]: Good time to chime in.

683
00:58:12,292 --> 00:58:14,513
[SPEAKER_01]: So they've already come before the calm calm and gotten approval.

684
00:58:15,185 --> 00:58:15,745
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay, great.

685
00:58:15,765 --> 00:58:16,526
[SPEAKER_01]: For that footprint.

686
00:58:18,427 --> 00:58:19,327
[SPEAKER_01]: What was that?

687
00:58:19,367 --> 00:58:21,168
[SPEAKER_01]: For that house, as proposed.

688
00:58:21,188 --> 00:58:21,888
[SPEAKER_01]: For that house, yeah.

689
00:58:22,068 --> 00:58:23,269
[SPEAKER_01]: For the new proposed house, yeah.

690
00:58:23,749 --> 00:58:24,790
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, cool.

691
00:58:25,430 --> 00:58:32,534
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, any other discussion on whether or not, or pass on review?

692
00:58:33,214 --> 00:58:34,154
[SPEAKER_07]: If not, I'll go to the vote.

693
00:58:34,174 --> 00:58:38,577
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, seeing none, I'll call it as I see it.

694
00:58:38,677 --> 00:58:39,117
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Peter?

695
00:58:41,213 --> 00:58:43,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes for passing on review.

696
00:58:44,218 --> 00:58:44,399
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

697
00:58:44,499 --> 00:58:44,859
[SPEAKER_07]: And Kit?

698
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:45,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

699
00:58:46,282 --> 00:58:46,762
[SPEAKER_07]: And Lenny?

700
00:58:47,363 --> 00:58:47,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

701
00:58:48,185 --> 00:58:48,525
[SPEAKER_07]: And Doug?

702
00:58:48,906 --> 00:58:49,186
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

703
00:58:49,828 --> 00:58:50,028
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

704
00:58:50,148 --> 00:58:50,509
[SPEAKER_07]: And Jen?

705
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:51,390
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

706
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:52,652
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, 5-0 approved.

707
00:58:55,262 --> 00:58:58,466
[SPEAKER_07]: Great, so we will get that letter out saying that we passed on review.

708
00:58:58,486 --> 00:59:06,056
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, next up section 106 reviews commissioners I sent around I'll just take these both real quickly.

709
00:59:06,076 --> 00:59:07,257
[SPEAKER_07]: 121 Riverside have the.

710
00:59:11,883 --> 00:59:17,388
[SPEAKER_07]: AT&T sent a notice that they're just making very, very minor changes to the cell towers on the roof.

711
00:59:17,608 --> 00:59:30,438
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think we have any comments, so I'd like to just send back that we have no comment, because the building's being rehabbed by the housing authority, so there's nothing really historic about it at this point.

712
00:59:30,579 --> 00:59:34,742
[SPEAKER_07]: Unless any of you disagree, I think that we should just send back comments saying we have no comments.

713
00:59:36,744 --> 00:59:37,364
[SPEAKER_13]: We should pass?

714
00:59:37,985 --> 00:59:39,226
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm totally fine with that.

715
00:59:42,715 --> 00:59:48,878
[SPEAKER_07]: For 20 Harvard Ave, the Massachusetts Historical Commission came back because that building is a little bit more historic.

716
00:59:49,258 --> 00:59:53,080
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually, MHC believes it's National Register eligible.

717
00:59:53,460 --> 01:00:05,626
[SPEAKER_07]: So they came back and asked the cell tower providers why they can't provide their new towers in all of the existing fake chimneys that are on that roof.

718
01:00:05,666 --> 01:00:09,888
[SPEAKER_07]: There's something like, something absurd number like 15 or something like that now.

719
01:00:12,488 --> 01:00:19,478
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think we can let MHC duke it out, and I think we should just continue to have no comment on that particular project as well.

720
01:00:21,161 --> 01:00:27,971
[SPEAKER_07]: So unless anybody opposes, we'll have that, and they'll just say no comment at this point.

721
01:00:31,534 --> 01:00:32,755
[SPEAKER_07]: Hearing none, we'll be good to go.

722
01:00:33,616 --> 01:00:40,541
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so for cross street cemetery monument restoration, so we're on to the pilot programs.

723
01:00:40,561 --> 01:00:41,181
[SPEAKER_07]: So.

724
01:00:45,173 --> 01:00:56,926
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to propose that the commission and the cemetery trustees work together again to start to execute the plan to restore headstones across street cemetery.

725
01:00:58,668 --> 01:01:00,170
[SPEAKER_07]: We had a consultant, as, you know.

726
01:01:02,592 --> 01:01:06,494
[SPEAKER_07]: Pulled together a list of work that was needed to be done for headstones.

727
01:01:08,015 --> 01:01:16,059
[SPEAKER_07]: I went back to the freedoms way National Heritage area that gave us one of the grants to ask if they would be willing to fund the restoration work.

728
01:01:16,099 --> 01:01:17,020
[SPEAKER_07]: The answer out of that was yes.

729
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:17,861
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, we would.

730
01:01:18,261 --> 01:01:20,603
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've already actually secured money from them.

731
01:01:20,623 --> 01:01:27,488
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to the CPC board tomorrow at 6.30 to request a small grant match.

732
01:01:28,089 --> 01:01:32,392
[SPEAKER_07]: That leaves $2,500 on the table for funding.

733
01:01:32,953 --> 01:01:34,694
[SPEAKER_07]: We have enough money in our budget.

734
01:01:35,755 --> 01:01:40,679
[SPEAKER_07]: Even if we spend wildly on inventory forms, we wouldn't come close to spending it all.

735
01:01:40,759 --> 01:01:43,581
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'd love to ask the commission to fund the remaining $2,500.

736
01:01:45,932 --> 01:01:50,556
[SPEAKER_07]: so that we can focus on the restoration of up to 15 headstones.

737
01:01:50,756 --> 01:01:55,240
[SPEAKER_07]: Specifically, these are headstones of the veterans in the cemetery.

738
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:56,441
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's the priority.

739
01:01:56,841 --> 01:02:04,367
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll help the consultants become familiar with the type of work necessary on the headstones themselves.

740
01:02:04,627 --> 01:02:13,014
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it sets the stage for the cemetery trustees to apply for the big funding from CPC in the fall, coupled with potentially a

741
01:02:15,503 --> 01:02:25,849
[SPEAKER_07]: state, there's like a state records board grant that funds more information and more restoration grants on things related specifically to veterans.

742
01:02:25,869 --> 01:02:31,272
[SPEAKER_07]: So if there's other stones related to them, then we can continue to use their money too as well.

743
01:02:33,474 --> 01:02:38,117
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm asking the commissioners to approve a $2,500 allocation towards this project.

744
01:02:39,717 --> 01:02:40,718
[SPEAKER_00]: I have one question.

745
01:02:41,038 --> 01:02:41,659
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, go for it.

746
01:02:41,799 --> 01:02:43,180
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we have any

747
01:02:44,649 --> 01:02:57,964
[SPEAKER_00]: worry that, and I don't even know if this would matter because I don't know that we can carry anything over, that our budget would be reduced at all our next fiscal year and we might need this money for forms for next fiscal year.

748
01:02:58,967 --> 01:03:02,031
[SPEAKER_07]: So funding doesn't carry over, so that's a great question.

749
01:03:02,411 --> 01:03:08,678
[SPEAKER_07]: So Freedom's Way grant is contingent that we spend their money and give them their final report by September 1st.

750
01:03:09,359 --> 01:03:13,604
[SPEAKER_07]: The consultants that did the assessment also do restoration.

751
01:03:13,704 --> 01:03:18,950
[SPEAKER_07]: They're pretty confident that they can do it actually before the end of the fiscal year, provided the weather is good.

752
01:03:19,570 --> 01:03:31,695
[SPEAKER_07]: So, and there's usually some overlap in budget, like, you know, we try to end the fiscal year on, you know, June 30 for July 1 rollover, but then there's some leeway.

753
01:03:31,735 --> 01:03:33,276
[SPEAKER_07]: There's usually like a 30-day lapse.

754
01:03:33,356 --> 01:03:41,579
[SPEAKER_07]: So, for like processing invoices that, you know, for people who work up until the 11th hour, the end of the month.

755
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:50,886
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we can't carry our budget over, so the more we allocate now, the more it will fall into that sort of grace period.

756
01:03:51,846 --> 01:04:01,713
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, even if we were spending money on our budget for forms a month between now and June, we would basically break even, you know.

757
01:04:01,794 --> 01:04:10,280
[SPEAKER_07]: So we can, you know, every month that we don't have inventory forms to prepare, we can just, you know, allocate it towards another project.

758
01:04:10,912 --> 01:04:28,168
[SPEAKER_13]: Ryan, I don't disagree with your approach, although I think if you went before the CPC tomorrow night, the board that I sit on, and you asked for $5,000, they would probably give it to you if I had to guess, given the context of the situation and what you're asking for.

759
01:04:30,611 --> 01:04:33,133
[SPEAKER_13]: But we also, I mean, just earlier this meeting,

760
01:04:35,918 --> 01:04:47,824
[SPEAKER_13]: we didn't have a forum B that would have been great to have because this timing didn't work, but maybe we could spend that money in other ways.

761
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:52,046
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm okay with spending it, but I don't think I want to spend it just to spend it.

762
01:04:53,346 --> 01:04:55,447
[SPEAKER_13]: I think the CPC will probably give you the 5K.

763
01:04:56,288 --> 01:04:58,849
[SPEAKER_13]: If there's other things we could do with that money, I'm okay with that too.

764
01:04:59,569 --> 01:04:59,870
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

765
01:05:01,355 --> 01:05:10,441
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so the CPC funding will match the Freedom's Way grant, which is a two-to-one match, so that's not a problem.

766
01:05:11,121 --> 01:05:22,648
[SPEAKER_07]: This will help us get to be able to do all of the veterans' headstones as part of the pilot project, rather than just leave a few of them off.

767
01:05:22,848 --> 01:05:26,410
[SPEAKER_07]: And there'll be some trade-offs, like one of them doesn't have a,

768
01:05:28,031 --> 01:05:29,532
[SPEAKER_07]: the top of it has disappeared.

769
01:05:30,453 --> 01:05:36,556
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm gonna talk with the consultants about recreating the headstone, but that may be cost prohibitive.

770
01:05:37,517 --> 01:05:38,998
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll save that for the bigger project.

771
01:05:39,098 --> 01:05:49,424
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm just, you know, and they said that they'd be willing to work on like the stone of a spouse related to the veterans, because they're usually side by side, you know, so there's a little bit of flexibility there.

772
01:05:50,104 --> 01:05:54,927
[SPEAKER_07]: And I am trying to keep it under $10,000 to go along with the CPC small grant.

773
01:05:56,624 --> 01:06:03,552
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a reason you can't just ask for $5,000 from CPC and then if they don't give it to you, we back up?

774
01:06:03,932 --> 01:06:10,399
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I'm going to ask for $5,000 from CPC, but this is in addition to that so that we have a nice even $10,000 project.

775
01:06:10,979 --> 01:06:12,100
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sorry, OK.

776
01:06:12,581 --> 01:06:12,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

777
01:06:13,802 --> 01:06:14,363
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so it's not $25,000, $25,000, $25,000.

778
01:06:16,516 --> 01:06:23,638
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's CPC is getting 50% Freedoms Way has 25 and I'm asking for the other 25 to come from.

779
01:06:24,979 --> 01:06:26,879
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's a nice distribution there.

780
01:06:26,959 --> 01:06:37,923
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I am working with Stacey Clayton to approach the mayor about asking in the there, meaning the cemetery trustees budget.

781
01:06:39,563 --> 01:06:52,472
[SPEAKER_07]: For funding, whether it comes out of city funding or their own endowment allocated specifically towards the restoration of monuments from year to year because they will always have problems with monuments weathering.

782
01:06:52,532 --> 01:07:00,278
[SPEAKER_07]: So it might as well just establish a small fund year to year that they might be able to tackle five or 10 or however many so

783
01:07:04,062 --> 01:07:13,224
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that they have funding to help themselves, you know, more than just we're sort of contributing now with the expectation that they'll maintain the cemetery in the future.

784
01:07:17,284 --> 01:07:18,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Further discussion?

785
01:07:20,745 --> 01:07:21,465
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we need a motion?

786
01:07:21,945 --> 01:07:22,125
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

787
01:07:23,825 --> 01:07:29,767
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll make a motion to allocate $2,500 to the Cross Street Cemetery Monument restoration.

788
01:07:29,787 --> 01:07:32,387
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, and a second.

789
01:07:35,059 --> 01:07:36,420
[SPEAKER_07]: 7.

790
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:36,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Doug.

791
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:40,442
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, I'll go around as I see you.

792
01:07:40,562 --> 01:07:40,842
[SPEAKER_07]: Peter?

793
01:07:42,103 --> 01:07:42,403
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

794
01:07:43,503 --> 01:07:44,304
[SPEAKER_07]: And Kit?

795
01:07:45,424 --> 01:07:45,725
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

796
01:07:46,545 --> 01:07:47,045
[SPEAKER_07]: And Eleni?

797
01:07:48,046 --> 01:07:48,306
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

798
01:07:48,766 --> 01:07:49,106
[SPEAKER_07]: And Doug?

799
01:07:49,867 --> 01:07:50,147
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

800
01:07:50,887 --> 01:07:51,307
[SPEAKER_08]: And Jen?

801
01:07:51,708 --> 01:07:51,968
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

802
01:07:52,628 --> 01:07:54,029
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, 5-0 approved.

803
01:07:55,509 --> 01:07:57,831
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I ask a related, but

804
01:07:59,170 --> 01:08:00,130
[SPEAKER_11]: unrelated question.

805
01:08:01,370 --> 01:08:09,732
[SPEAKER_11]: Which is the Salem, I'm just thinking about monument restoration, the Salem Street burying ground, whose purview is that under?

806
01:08:10,432 --> 01:08:27,155
[SPEAKER_07]: It's under the cemetery trustees and we, meaning the commission, I think maybe Doug might have been on the commission and I was on there, but Nino Susi and a man named Bob Spry worked with the mayor's office to get a

807
01:08:28,172 --> 01:08:51,644
[SPEAKER_07]: mass preservation project funding grant for the restoration planning for that cemetery and then the actual execution of the restoration of, I don't know, 150 headstones or something like that, and took them the better part of two or three years to actually undertake and complete all that work, but we spent a boatload of money on that cemetery, so we're just kind of

808
01:08:53,105 --> 01:09:06,859
[SPEAKER_07]: I use that to acquire grants by saying that we've already undertaken one project in the past and then that's one of the reasons why freedoms way gave us the grant because we already have one under our belt, so to speak, so that and this.

809
01:09:07,820 --> 01:09:29,369
[SPEAKER_07]: project, this little tiny cemetery, sort of sets the precedent for what the cemetery trustees would do in the older portion of Oak Grove, because there's a lot of stones in there that are toppled over and just need some work and need some dressing up over many, many, many years, including the landscaping itself.

810
01:09:30,189 --> 01:09:33,371
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

811
01:09:33,971 --> 01:09:34,371
[SPEAKER_07]: You're welcome.

812
01:09:36,292 --> 01:09:36,752
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything else?

813
01:09:39,398 --> 01:09:49,467
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I have 1 thing to add for new business before we go into old business and I think.

814
01:09:50,548 --> 01:09:58,856
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it wasn't on the agenda, but we had talked about this a while back and I sort of have a loose idea on how to do it.

815
01:09:59,396 --> 01:10:00,577
[SPEAKER_07]: We had talked about doing.

816
01:10:01,758 --> 01:10:09,160
[SPEAKER_07]: renewal of our overarching directives for demolition delay.

817
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:15,341
[SPEAKER_07]: For example, the last time we set a directive for concrete block garages was actually 2018.

818
01:10:17,202 --> 01:10:20,082
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's time we actually renew that at some point.

819
01:10:21,123 --> 01:10:28,524
[SPEAKER_07]: Then I had talked about creating an overarching way to expedite pre-1900 buildings from

820
01:10:31,545 --> 01:10:34,788
[SPEAKER_07]: rather than waiting for significance to just find them all significant.

821
01:10:35,529 --> 01:10:36,910
[SPEAKER_07]: So I have some thoughts written out.

822
01:10:37,551 --> 01:10:48,281
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to establish a three or four person subcommittee to sort of hash them out and bring it to the commission for approval next month if some people want to.

823
01:10:49,242 --> 01:10:55,828
[SPEAKER_07]: join me on that or support those ideas just so we sort of go back and look at those and then set directives.

824
01:10:55,868 --> 01:11:07,758
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is just a pure way to sort of expedite some of these reviews that are coming up so that they can basically, you know, move forward in the process quicker if you have a certain type of building.

825
01:11:07,778 --> 01:11:14,844
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I'd help you with that.

826
01:11:19,315 --> 01:11:19,796
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

827
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:25,320
[SPEAKER_08]: Anybody else?

828
01:11:27,322 --> 01:11:30,385
[SPEAKER_00]: I will volunteer to edit the first draft of what you write up.

829
01:11:31,005 --> 01:11:31,646
[SPEAKER_07]: I will do that.

830
01:11:32,406 --> 01:11:35,249
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to rope, Ed's not here, but I'm going to rope Ed into it.

831
01:11:35,309 --> 01:11:37,411
[SPEAKER_07]: So yes, and then you can have it after Ed's at it.

832
01:11:37,791 --> 01:11:38,191
[SPEAKER_07]: How's that?

833
01:11:39,252 --> 01:11:39,973
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's fine.

834
01:11:40,233 --> 01:11:47,219
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll go from like, like legalese, solid legalese to like making sure that it sounds public friendly.

835
01:11:49,017 --> 01:11:49,337
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, OK.

836
01:11:49,357 --> 01:11:49,777
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

837
01:11:49,817 --> 01:11:49,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Good.

838
01:11:49,937 --> 01:11:50,657
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

839
01:11:50,737 --> 01:11:54,218
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll we'll do that and we'll we'll circle back.

840
01:11:54,258 --> 01:11:59,379
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll try to group everybody together so that we can try to do as many things as once as we can at once.

841
01:11:59,519 --> 01:12:00,140
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, thank you.

842
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:03,600
[SPEAKER_07]: Jen, was there something else that I seem to recall?

843
01:12:03,620 --> 01:12:06,921
[SPEAKER_07]: I had you remind me of.

844
01:12:06,941 --> 01:12:09,942
[SPEAKER_07]: I totally.

845
01:12:09,982 --> 01:12:14,563
[SPEAKER_00]: You texted me something to remind you and hold on.

846
01:12:16,777 --> 01:12:19,359
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it was the cemetery project.

847
01:12:19,719 --> 01:12:20,941
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, alright, good, that's it.

848
01:12:21,181 --> 01:12:22,642
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, great, I did that good.

849
01:12:22,842 --> 01:12:28,167
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, OK, we'll move forward into old business unless anybody else has anything new.

850
01:12:30,049 --> 01:12:30,650
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd seen none.

851
01:12:32,403 --> 01:12:33,884
[SPEAKER_07]: preservation ordinance discussion.

852
01:12:34,424 --> 01:12:41,890
[SPEAKER_07]: Along those lines, Jen Doherty, I think I said, sent me a whole bunch of ordinances.

853
01:12:42,230 --> 01:12:43,571
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been reading them.

854
01:12:44,591 --> 01:12:56,500
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of them are buried way deep in so much legal jargon, but I'm sort of pulling extracts for you guys to sort of show the highlights and I'll try to bring that to the, maybe we'll have like a,

855
01:12:58,061 --> 01:13:09,430
[SPEAKER_07]: Sort of a separate meeting outside of the regular meetings list to sort of go over that and the hash out the demo delay directives.

856
01:13:09,490 --> 01:13:14,193
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe on a night that there isn't anything active on the table might be a might be a good time.

857
01:13:14,213 --> 01:13:16,135
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

858
01:13:18,267 --> 01:13:25,854
[SPEAKER_07]: For demo properties under demo delay, I think we agreed to refer 27 almost 3 to the HTC.

859
01:13:25,894 --> 01:13:31,079
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to try to sit down with the historic district commission on possibly Thursday.

860
01:13:31,139 --> 01:13:33,942
[SPEAKER_07]: If they're meeting on Thursday, luckily for us.

861
01:13:37,326 --> 01:13:45,469
[SPEAKER_07]: Teresa is their staff person now, so, and she regularly meets with the chair, which is great to have, like, a standing.

862
01:13:46,249 --> 01:13:53,692
[SPEAKER_07]: Monthly phone call before the meeting so that they know what's going on and I think that that will be.

863
01:13:54,712 --> 01:14:06,139
[SPEAKER_07]: useful to let them know that we'll be coming to the table, and they can take advantage of the time that I'm there just to, if they have any questions on procedure and stuff like that.

864
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:10,962
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll see if we can try to get them to meet on a monthly basis.

865
01:14:11,022 --> 01:14:13,143
[SPEAKER_07]: And they have a full board now.

866
01:14:13,604 --> 01:14:16,665
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's seven people on that board.

867
01:14:17,206 --> 01:14:18,907
[SPEAKER_07]: So it'll be great to see them move forward.

868
01:14:20,942 --> 01:14:24,324
[SPEAKER_07]: I am having difficulty, though, finding somebody to do documentation.

869
01:14:24,384 --> 01:14:46,314
[SPEAKER_07]: So part of the issue, I did, Doug, circling back to your comment about spending money, and the issue with the consultants is that the current people that we use are just so incredibly busy that they were not able to do all of the forms at once that we gave them, and I actually put some of the other ones that we didn't need off until this month.

870
01:14:47,274 --> 01:14:48,274
[SPEAKER_07]: I did shop around.

871
01:14:48,354 --> 01:14:48,955
[SPEAKER_07]: I did asks.

872
01:14:49,855 --> 01:15:05,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the consultants that normally work in this field, if they were willing to or able to do a forms for a certain set price and a certain time, and they were not willing to buy into the process, so we were out of luck there.

873
01:15:07,241 --> 01:15:17,344
[SPEAKER_07]: But I do think it's important that we start to establish a relationship with other consultants in this field, because the current consultants love doing what they're doing, but they're not going to be doing it forever.

874
01:15:19,245 --> 01:15:21,025
[SPEAKER_13]: Was it the time, the money, or both?

875
01:15:22,046 --> 01:15:23,046
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's the time.

876
01:15:23,066 --> 01:15:24,946
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the time.

877
01:15:24,966 --> 01:15:32,167
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, I think since I've been on the commission, the price hasn't changed.

878
01:15:32,207 --> 01:15:36,508
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wonder if we need to raise the price a little bit of what we're offering.

879
01:15:36,528 --> 01:15:46,330
[SPEAKER_07]: No, because we're offering, I would say, that's more than the fair rate of what the grant paid work pays.

880
01:15:46,810 --> 01:15:47,350
[SPEAKER_07]: So really,

881
01:15:49,430 --> 01:15:53,692
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't say it's easier to research a single-off building.

882
01:15:53,752 --> 01:16:01,756
[SPEAKER_07]: It's nicer when you have a group of them, but we are paying probably three times the rate that Mass Historical pays for their grants.

883
01:16:02,596 --> 01:16:05,017
[SPEAKER_07]: Their work is not very well-funded.

884
01:16:05,077 --> 01:16:17,843
[SPEAKER_07]: The benefit is that you're doing a bunch of buildings with a common history, whereas the trade-off with us is we're doing a one-off building that may or may not be in an area that the consultants are familiar with or have researched previously.

885
01:16:18,443 --> 01:16:21,445
[SPEAKER_07]: So I wouldn't say that the price is an issue.

886
01:16:21,805 --> 01:16:33,611
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, jacking up the price is only going to attract, say, a firm with more overhead, but you're not going to get a better quality product for that time frame.

887
01:16:34,632 --> 01:16:37,333
[SPEAKER_13]: Ryan, we're talking about $500 for each Form B, right?

888
01:16:37,774 --> 01:16:38,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

889
01:16:39,014 --> 01:16:45,258
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I don't know what hourly rate you think these people are billing at, but

890
01:16:46,398 --> 01:16:53,021
[SPEAKER_13]: Even at $100 an hour, each one, five hours, there's a lot of work in these forms.

891
01:16:53,101 --> 01:16:55,883
[SPEAKER_13]: It seems like some of them are five, six, seven pages.

892
01:16:55,903 --> 01:16:58,164
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't done them, obviously.

893
01:16:58,184 --> 01:17:03,486
[SPEAKER_13]: I think you probably have in the past, but does that seem reasonable?

894
01:17:03,506 --> 01:17:04,987
[SPEAKER_13]: Because it seems a little low to me.

895
01:17:05,895 --> 01:17:14,881
[SPEAKER_07]: I think some of the higher paid firms are probably charging $100, $125 an hour or something like that for that work.

896
01:17:14,942 --> 01:17:22,507
[SPEAKER_07]: But some of the regular forms, I mean, six hours or five hours is probably a norm to create one of these forms.

897
01:17:25,232 --> 01:17:49,550
[SPEAKER_07]: you know realistically like mhc their forms space like hundred and forty bucks a form or something like that for the number of forms that and you know there's government paperwork that goes along with those so you know i i would say where you know pretty well can we give a bonus to our consultants if we want to pay them more yes we could yeah i don't do i think that will help though i i don't know

898
01:17:50,971 --> 01:18:00,476
[SPEAKER_07]: But also, I think it behooves us to, you know, if anything were to happen to the consultants, you know, it would be nice to have some other people to lean on.

899
01:18:01,276 --> 01:18:02,157
[SPEAKER_07]: For documentation,

900
01:18:03,287 --> 01:18:06,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Myron is too busy to be able to undertake this work.

901
01:18:06,608 --> 01:18:11,849
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's very few people that do this type of documentation that he has done.

902
01:18:11,869 --> 01:18:16,271
[SPEAKER_07]: So we may end up paying more for that.

903
01:18:18,291 --> 01:18:30,775
[SPEAKER_07]: And the nominal numbers that we were giving him, like the $2,000 or $3,000 or something like that that we were paying for the report, in no way cover the amount of time that was necessary to really undertake those reports.

904
01:18:32,095 --> 01:18:36,418
[SPEAKER_07]: report with any substance is easily a $5,000 to $10,000 proposition.

905
01:18:36,438 --> 01:18:43,043
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely think we need to get more people.

906
01:18:43,623 --> 01:18:45,344
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know how to go about doing that.

907
01:18:45,525 --> 01:18:47,646
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we get some college students?

908
01:18:47,926 --> 01:18:48,427
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Eleni.

909
01:18:48,467 --> 01:18:53,070
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I was going to say, I can reach out to some of my faculty and maybe recent graduates.

910
01:18:53,110 --> 01:18:55,071
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, college students sometimes

911
01:18:58,051 --> 01:19:13,002
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I think it's professionals just because like, you know, some of the faculty that I have that do this type of work for a living, they automatically know which places to go to to do the, you know, permit research, find historical photographs, things like that.

912
01:19:13,062 --> 01:19:21,588
[SPEAKER_10]: So kind of once you get into the groove of it, it can go quite quickly unless it's like a really complex site or a Form A or something that's much more than just one building.

913
01:19:22,028 --> 01:19:25,050
[SPEAKER_10]: But I can ask around to some of my faculty and see if

914
01:19:26,576 --> 01:19:34,699
[SPEAKER_10]: They know someone or some recent graduates who are still in the area who might be interested in doing this type of work.

915
01:19:35,180 --> 01:19:35,380
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

916
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:39,121
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think just to have like a deeper list of people to ask.

917
01:19:39,681 --> 01:19:39,962
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

918
01:19:40,022 --> 01:19:42,583
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I also I wouldn't be opposed to.

919
01:19:44,032 --> 01:19:59,197
[SPEAKER_00]: You know if there's something that is we need it like kind of quickly or there is something that kind of came up at the last minute and we're trying to like just get it on the agenda so that we can move forward like offering some sort of like rush fee.

920
01:19:59,937 --> 01:20:01,298
[SPEAKER_00]: You know I mean at the risk of like.

921
01:20:02,318 --> 01:20:05,460
[SPEAKER_00]: doge coming after us for like government waste.

922
01:20:07,801 --> 01:20:12,804
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, honestly, I mean, obviously, we're I think we're very cautious with our budget.

923
01:20:13,444 --> 01:20:15,766
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly our budget is very nominal.

924
01:20:15,826 --> 01:20:19,568
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, I want to be respectful of the work that we're asking people to do.

925
01:20:19,588 --> 01:20:29,233
[SPEAKER_00]: And recognize that if we are asking for something, and it needs to be turned around quickly, that we understand that there is

926
01:20:30,414 --> 01:20:34,859
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, some sort of surcharge or bonus in that because we need it.

927
01:20:35,620 --> 01:20:36,321
[SPEAKER_13]: I agree, Janet.

928
01:20:36,381 --> 01:20:39,885
[SPEAKER_13]: A premium for a week turnaround was something we really need.

929
01:20:40,225 --> 01:20:41,186
[SPEAKER_13]: We should be willing to pay that.

930
01:20:41,306 --> 01:20:41,947
[SPEAKER_13]: I 100% agree with that.

931
01:20:44,411 --> 01:20:55,843
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and knowing that, I mean, I think in the whole time I've been on the commission, I think besides Emerald Street tonight, I think we've only had one other instance where we didn't have a form to make a determination.

932
01:20:55,943 --> 01:21:02,070
[SPEAKER_00]: Either it was an error or I think there was that one time that like John went away and he didn't have access to his computer.

933
01:21:02,130 --> 01:21:05,033
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just like a mishap, but it's rare, right?

934
01:21:07,087 --> 01:21:14,189
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that having a few more people in our coffers to ask will obviously hopefully help avoid that situation.

935
01:21:14,749 --> 01:21:29,453
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if we do have something and we can put it out there to people to say, hey, we have this kind of urgent need and we're willing to pay for it, that might also incent somebody to take it.

936
01:21:31,135 --> 01:21:35,757
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and I mean, there's always oversight.

937
01:21:35,817 --> 01:21:36,798
[SPEAKER_07]: It's good experience.

938
01:21:38,058 --> 01:21:39,219
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't have experience.

939
01:21:39,239 --> 01:21:42,260
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm happy to review, provide comments, that sort of thing.

940
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:57,847
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to maybe be able to try to find a way to maybe connect the existing consultants with the potential new ones type of thing to try to find a way to work together.

941
01:22:00,545 --> 01:22:04,286
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, just to see how that is, and that might work for documentation too as well.

942
01:22:04,326 --> 01:22:11,489
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how deep we can go into it, but I'm also happy to use it as sort of a quasi learning experience.

943
01:22:12,270 --> 01:22:18,872
[SPEAKER_07]: There are plenty of people, I'm sure Doug and Peter can appreciate this, that I can drill bad habits out of people drawing buildings.

944
01:22:21,233 --> 01:22:24,036
[SPEAKER_07]: know, because there's plenty of bad drawers out there, unfortunately.

945
01:22:24,196 --> 01:22:38,333
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, Ryan, there's a comment in the chat from one of our participants here tonight saying that, is it you know, can we invite retired folks to do some of this work, but I don't know what the I think these people have to be credentialed.

946
01:22:39,734 --> 01:22:41,216
[SPEAKER_07]: For this particular type of work.

947
01:22:41,256 --> 01:22:46,943
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, but it doesn't mean that we can't set people to a task of say researching a neighborhood or something like that.

948
01:22:47,003 --> 01:22:50,468
[SPEAKER_07]: If we had an area of interest that was just research based.

949
01:22:50,548 --> 01:22:52,911
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that certainly might be a fun project to do.

950
01:22:52,931 --> 01:22:57,297
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I mean, I might have retired folks that

951
01:22:57,767 --> 01:23:09,051
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe did work as historians or architectural historians or architects and you know I have a faculty member who's retiring and I have a call with her tomorrow, you know she could definitely do something like this.

952
01:23:11,212 --> 01:23:13,273
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think, for you know us.

953
01:23:14,746 --> 01:23:17,068
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, certainly district, the Brooks Estate.

954
01:23:17,228 --> 01:23:24,975
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if there are folks out there that are willing to volunteer their time, you know, obviously this is something different because we pay for these forms.

955
01:23:25,055 --> 01:23:37,286
[SPEAKER_00]: But if somebody is wanting to do researching or help with archiving or file sorting in any sort of volunteer basis, or perhaps some sort of nominal stipend,

956
01:23:38,047 --> 01:23:40,389
[SPEAKER_00]: I think any one of us would love to hear from them.

957
01:23:40,669 --> 01:23:43,130
[SPEAKER_00]: And please raise your hand, reach out.

958
01:23:43,270 --> 01:23:47,573
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like if you will come to us, we will find you a project.

959
01:23:48,594 --> 01:23:49,314
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

960
01:23:49,334 --> 01:23:51,936
[SPEAKER_10]: I think for the Form Bs, definitely, we should still pay.

961
01:23:52,036 --> 01:23:57,519
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, I mean, that's not to say we can't use volunteer for other things.

962
01:23:57,539 --> 01:24:00,161
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree with that.

963
01:24:01,462 --> 01:24:01,682
Great.

964
01:24:02,843 --> 01:24:03,103
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

965
01:24:03,223 --> 01:24:04,804
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll keep working on that.

966
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:13,141
[SPEAKER_07]: So for form Bs for preemptive projects, I think the only one that we're waiting on, I ordered Curtis.

967
01:24:13,582 --> 01:24:15,122
[SPEAKER_07]: We have one on Spring Street.

968
01:24:16,102 --> 01:24:25,625
[SPEAKER_07]: We have the two that we took tonight, 122 Woodruff, but we didn't take Winford Way, so that's out, so that's good.

969
01:24:27,845 --> 01:24:29,106
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, that's it.

970
01:24:29,306 --> 01:24:32,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there any other properties that people have seen out on the market?

971
01:24:33,247 --> 01:24:34,587
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything that we want to target?

972
01:24:38,174 --> 01:24:44,618
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so we'll, you know, if you see something, just send us an email because like I said, there's a standing order to just prepare form.

973
01:24:44,698 --> 01:24:57,347
[SPEAKER_07]: So, if stuff seems like it's being targeted for a demo or for any sort of redevelopment opportunity, it's common terminology that we'll be able to figure that out.

974
01:24:58,328 --> 01:24:59,028
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we.

975
01:25:01,465 --> 01:25:22,997
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we need to talk about anything with regards to the zoning project on Salem Street that a lot of folks are talking about in terms of our purview as historical and the density that might be coming there and anything in that, since we're talking about demo and forthcoming stuff?

976
01:25:23,818 --> 01:25:28,180
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think it's fair to maybe ask

977
01:25:30,404 --> 01:25:38,406
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a meeting going on tonight just for the full disclosure that where the city is talking with the residents about this pending change.

978
01:25:38,786 --> 01:25:43,947
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's important that the city take that information and review it with the consultants.

979
01:25:44,287 --> 01:25:50,829
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think maybe we should ask to hear their clarifications as part of that and understand the.

980
01:25:53,891 --> 01:26:16,516
[SPEAKER_07]: understand the potential zoning change there so that we can chime in on the existing density, existing historic resources in that neighborhood, because if folks are not aware, we went through two rounds of survey in East Medford, which contains the highest concentration of pre-1900 buildings anywhere, the highest concentration of pre-1875 and 1855 buildings anywhere in the city.

981
01:26:16,656 --> 01:26:23,038
[SPEAKER_07]: So, and, you know, Salem Street, the corridor itself and Haines Square is pretty rich.

982
01:26:24,018 --> 01:26:26,399
[SPEAKER_07]: both commercial and residential architecture.

983
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:30,222
[SPEAKER_07]: So it would be good to just chime in on that project.

984
01:26:31,042 --> 01:26:40,167
[SPEAKER_07]: After perhaps some of the back and forth with the, you know, the city is going to be focused on dealing with and discussing this whole change with the residents.

985
01:26:40,207 --> 01:26:52,374
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think it's important that we sort of chime in to provide our expertise, which is using the documentation that we've prepared for some of these projects and let it influence, you know, the directive there.

986
01:26:55,836 --> 01:26:59,221
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I mean certainly there's a lot of properties over there have big lots.

987
01:26:59,862 --> 01:27:04,048
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, certainly enough from go from, you know, to go from single family to two units.

988
01:27:07,178 --> 01:27:15,620
[SPEAKER_07]: And maybe Dennis, maybe we can connect to try to get some basic information for what's being proposed there.

989
01:27:16,141 --> 01:27:22,422
[SPEAKER_07]: And we want to sort of loop in on what the city's already discussing with the residents.

990
01:27:22,442 --> 01:27:27,043
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't necessarily, you know, we're not trying to add to their burden at this point.

991
01:27:27,063 --> 01:27:30,564
[SPEAKER_07]: We're just trying to hop in and provide some comment that will help them.

992
01:27:31,324 --> 01:27:35,166
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, do what's best for this, understand the neighborhood and do what's best for the neighborhood.

993
01:27:38,428 --> 01:27:41,710
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, I think the other thing is like, how do we comment.

994
01:27:43,471 --> 01:27:48,854
[SPEAKER_00]: Constructively when nobody knows what's going to happen there yet.

995
01:27:48,934 --> 01:27:53,017
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're just saying these things are going to be changed to allow it to happen.

996
01:27:53,957 --> 01:27:55,298
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know.

997
01:27:57,332 --> 01:27:59,874
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, and perhaps this goes back to like establishing some.

998
01:27:59,894 --> 01:28:04,538
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like we're looking at three blocks of like a site plan review, right?

999
01:28:04,578 --> 01:28:04,838
[SPEAKER_00]: Like.

1000
01:28:05,699 --> 01:28:08,401
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, and it goes back to like establishing directives, right?

1001
01:28:08,441 --> 01:28:17,248
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if they change the zoning and all of a sudden some of these major projects come on, we may see demolition after demolition proposed and you know.

1002
01:28:19,269 --> 01:28:27,394
[SPEAKER_07]: If we're standing in the way of something that the city has changed and set as a path for progress, we don't necessarily look very good.

1003
01:28:27,434 --> 01:28:36,280
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'd like to be a part of the process so that we can make a decision now on whether or not it's beneficial or whether or not it's going to cause problems down the road.

1004
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:36,560
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1005
01:28:37,861 --> 01:28:46,487
[SPEAKER_13]: Ryan, what I would recommend is we might even put this to a subcommittee, although that might be difficult timing-wise because I feel like

1006
01:28:47,944 --> 01:28:52,018
[SPEAKER_13]: To Jen's point, we want to be engaged in a little bit, but we're really talking about

1007
01:28:52,962 --> 01:28:55,042
[SPEAKER_13]: about principles, right?

1008
01:28:55,143 --> 01:29:07,665
[SPEAKER_13]: When there's properties that are, we think, worth preserving or respecting, we need to come say that, and that needs to be part of the zoning discussion.

1009
01:29:07,725 --> 01:29:13,927
[SPEAKER_13]: It shouldn't be a blank slate, like they can just wipe out everything on Salem Street, which I know is the worst case scenario and the fear.

1010
01:29:13,967 --> 01:29:22,229
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't think that's likely, but there are clearly buildings and experiences along that street

1011
01:29:23,210 --> 01:29:29,563
[SPEAKER_13]: that are character defining and I think we can put together with a little thought and understanding at least where they're heading.

1012
01:29:31,330 --> 01:29:54,755
[SPEAKER_13]: how we could react to that and get in the game here, because obviously it's a pretty hot topic, and there's a lot of people who are nervous and afraid, and there's probably some misinformation out there, and there's a lot of unknowns, because as Jen said, we're not talking about a plan that we can react to, it's broader than that, and for better or worse, we need to kind of

1013
01:29:55,643 --> 01:30:01,451
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we should guide that plan a little bit and at least get our thumbs on the scale for what we feel is important.

1014
01:30:02,220 --> 01:30:16,027
[SPEAKER_00]: I also think this could be an opportunity where we, and I don't know how easy it is to do this in what I feel like is not a lot of time, but like, what are the vulnerable houses in that grid?

1015
01:30:16,687 --> 01:30:24,751
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we need to, at the very least, like put a list in front of them and say, these are the ones that, you know, are the most vulnerable.

1016
01:30:25,672 --> 01:30:27,473
[SPEAKER_00]: And also that, you know,

1017
01:30:29,106 --> 01:30:35,733
[SPEAKER_00]: we would prefer not to have a three-unit building built onto it or behind it or whatever.

1018
01:30:37,174 --> 01:30:48,245
[SPEAKER_00]: Can these be exempted from, and I don't know the legality of that, if it's a private homeowner or whatever, how can we say we don't want this to change?

1019
01:30:49,125 --> 01:30:53,450
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know about that, but this, I think that,

1020
01:30:54,527 --> 01:31:03,752
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, for the time I've been on this commission, we have lost a lot of houses that could have easily been single house historic districts.

1021
01:31:04,653 --> 01:31:13,378
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that district is working off of a list to try to tackle and protect some of these properties before it's too late.

1022
01:31:14,999 --> 01:31:17,961
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's massive missed opportunity for things like that.

1023
01:31:19,347 --> 01:31:35,121
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know, I don't, and without them kind of steering the ship here, I feel like we need to, or maybe we come together as joint commissions and saying, hey, like, you know, we need to protect our historic resources in this neighborhood.

1024
01:31:35,562 --> 01:31:41,087
[SPEAKER_00]: And that has to be a massive part of the discussion of this that I don't know that anybody is considering right now.

1025
01:31:42,007 --> 01:31:57,312
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think it would be beneficial to have them come to our meeting, especially for perhaps some of their for their new chair and their their new members to see how, first of all, to see how we run a meeting and see how we digest historically.

1026
01:31:57,332 --> 01:32:13,997
[SPEAKER_07]: resources and then to work with them on using the documentation that we've prepared and maybe come up with some priorities like, you know, saying, you know, we started Forest Street we'll go back to Forest Street or, you know, we started some of these other areas and we, you know,

1027
01:32:15,091 --> 01:32:17,593
[SPEAKER_07]: there's some support there, so maybe we go look at those.

1028
01:32:18,394 --> 01:32:36,169
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess most importantly, if Salem Street is a good instance of that, perhaps we just start by asking the community what they would like to see preserved, and if there's any volunteers, because volunteer historic districts are the easiest to create, especially in a time where we have sort of a semi-unanimous city council.

1029
01:32:38,422 --> 01:32:47,892
[SPEAKER_11]: I also think, I mean, I haven't heard that there's been very much discussion about the history of Salem Street or Haines Square at all.

1030
01:32:49,707 --> 01:32:52,068
[SPEAKER_11]: in sort of the larger zoning discussions about this.

1031
01:32:52,128 --> 01:33:03,573
[SPEAKER_11]: And it may be just if you, I mean, what you were starting to say at the beginning, Ryan, about, you know, an interesting historical inventory of residential and commercial houses.

1032
01:33:03,613 --> 01:33:07,455
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, if we could provide, we've done surveys of other neighborhoods.

1033
01:33:07,495 --> 01:33:16,539
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we have anything on Salem Street that we could say, hey, look, you know, this is what you should know about the history of this area.

1034
01:33:17,306 --> 01:33:41,535
[SPEAKER_07]: yeah there's uh... there's lots of information on both the development history and hain square and some individual buildings up and down salem street i'd just you know there's a lot of density there are ready you know the slide three deckers is a lot of to family ask looking buildings that are actually threes uh... you know and you know there are some good development opportunities i don't disagree with that finding you know there's that

1035
01:33:42,195 --> 01:34:07,762
[SPEAKER_07]: stupid hole opposite the potter building that has been sitting for a while waiting for some new zoning but uh... you know and i'm i'm not opposed to some up zoning in in core locations uh... historically we've seen you know these one-page one-story taxpayer blocks were always meant is like a temporary hold and then they would build on top of them in and add buildings and there's some of that in haines square uh... and

1036
01:34:08,919 --> 01:34:35,048
[SPEAKER_07]: the stupid commercial strip malls that are there uh... you know can certainly be put away for some more high-rise density you know so there's opportunity i don't know uh... i don't know how much development will happen or what will happen to the existing buildings if say you have a large three-story residential house that's already occupied why would you tear it down to upzone

1037
01:34:35,888 --> 01:34:39,541
[SPEAKER_07]: unless you assemble a series of lots and pull them together.

1038
01:34:42,265 --> 01:34:45,126
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think to Doug's point, it's the principle of the thing, right?

1039
01:34:45,266 --> 01:34:50,447
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's we want to be part of these conversations before they get to the stage that they're at with Salem Street.

1040
01:34:50,987 --> 01:34:51,167
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1041
01:34:51,347 --> 01:34:57,648
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, you know, too, it looks like some of the zoning is like fanning out into the adjacent lots on the neighborhood.

1042
01:34:57,668 --> 01:35:00,029
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's like a step down that's that's expected.

1043
01:35:00,109 --> 01:35:06,270
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, do we want to change those neighborhoods because that's going to clash against some of the lower density residential?

1044
01:35:09,086 --> 01:35:09,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1045
01:35:09,326 --> 01:35:09,527
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1046
01:35:09,547 --> 01:35:11,128
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, so what do we do?

1047
01:35:11,188 --> 01:35:15,673
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I feel like, well, I think we have already discussing this.

1048
01:35:16,214 --> 01:35:16,354
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1049
01:35:16,374 --> 01:35:17,175
[SPEAKER_07]: They're discussing it.

1050
01:35:17,275 --> 01:35:22,400
[SPEAKER_07]: I think maybe we ask Alicia to bring us to the table.

1051
01:35:22,581 --> 01:35:26,985
[SPEAKER_07]: I write and ask them what their, I, I would ask them what their plan is for this.

1052
01:35:27,045 --> 01:35:27,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause I mean, if they're,

1053
01:35:29,136 --> 01:35:36,779
[SPEAKER_07]: If they're going to move forward with it, I, you know, I think that the bottom line is that I think they we should ask to come to the table.

1054
01:35:37,459 --> 01:35:45,341
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I feel like we should write a letter and maybe jointly with the District Commission and and outline our concerns.

1055
01:35:47,522 --> 01:35:49,783
[SPEAKER_00]: And perhaps, you know, throw some.

1056
01:35:51,323 --> 01:35:56,645
[SPEAKER_00]: addresses on there of like, you know, these are significant or refer them to the forms or whatever.

1057
01:35:56,665 --> 01:36:02,547
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we need to get something in writing and documented of our stance on this.

1058
01:36:02,627 --> 01:36:05,848
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, yes, we want to be invited to these conversations.

1059
01:36:05,908 --> 01:36:13,051
[SPEAKER_00]: And thus far, we haven't been, except obviously, we commented on the, excuse me, the comprehensive plan.

1060
01:36:13,071 --> 01:36:14,631
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a couple of years ago at this point.

1061
01:36:17,697 --> 01:36:24,286
[SPEAKER_00]: And any stakeholder conversations that are taking place within the city, we should all be involved in.

1062
01:36:28,564 --> 01:36:30,546
[SPEAKER_13]: We can write that letter in a couple of days, right?

1063
01:36:30,986 --> 01:36:36,030
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if we should do a joint with the other commission because that would, there'd be some coordination there.

1064
01:36:36,070 --> 01:36:37,211
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we can just get out.

1065
01:36:37,832 --> 01:36:47,920
[SPEAKER_13]: They can sign on to our letter if they want to, but I don't want to group write it because that group has, we've been around for a long, a cohesive commission for a fairly long time.

1066
01:36:47,940 --> 01:36:51,643
[SPEAKER_13]: It sounds like it's a whole, it's basically a new commission almost from ground up.

1067
01:36:53,388 --> 01:36:59,473
[SPEAKER_13]: But if we write that letter and talk about just broad concepts that we want to make sure they're part of a plan.

1068
01:37:03,084 --> 01:37:08,786
[SPEAKER_13]: and ask to be a stakeholder, ask to be engaged, try to bring our expertise to the table.

1069
01:37:08,886 --> 01:37:14,608
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that's enough to crack the door open before things get passed that perhaps we don't want.

1070
01:37:14,628 --> 01:37:18,110
[SPEAKER_13]: I think there's a good chance it will be heard.

1071
01:37:18,130 --> 01:37:20,191
[SPEAKER_13]: While we're doing that, we need to look at

1072
01:37:23,687 --> 01:37:31,659
[SPEAKER_13]: All our form these, you know, we need to kind of see what we've got and make it an assessment of the quarter from, you know, from pretty quickly.

1073
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:35,244
[SPEAKER_13]: So we can, we can have some thoughts when we, if we're invited to the team.

1074
01:37:36,259 --> 01:37:36,459
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

1075
01:37:36,539 --> 01:37:46,725
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think the bottom line is, like any good engaging project, is that the goal is to get a product that's better than what we're currently seeing.

1076
01:37:46,745 --> 01:37:48,366
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what we'll end up with, I think.

1077
01:37:48,807 --> 01:37:58,572
[SPEAKER_07]: No matter what happens with community involvement, with our involvement, with whoever's involvement, it'll be better than what it started with, because collective minds pull it together.

1078
01:37:58,592 --> 01:37:58,632
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

1079
01:38:01,622 --> 01:38:10,464
[SPEAKER_07]: If I, I'm going to send out some macros data, you know, so that we can sort of pull together, like, here's the buildings that have been inventoried in this neighborhood type of thing.

1080
01:38:10,484 --> 01:38:11,345
[SPEAKER_07]: So you guys can see it.

1081
01:38:12,065 --> 01:38:17,186
[SPEAKER_07]: Doug, I know this is my neighborhood, but can you draft some sort of letter to get us started?

1082
01:38:17,246 --> 01:38:23,908
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll get us started and then I'll put it out to the crowd and the fabulous editors on this board will take it and make it better.

1083
01:38:24,468 --> 01:38:24,708
Thanks.

1084
01:38:25,410 --> 01:38:36,458
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and why don't we each look at the MACRS and say, OK, here's I think very quickly would probably come to a consensus on these are the ones.

1085
01:38:36,639 --> 01:38:46,566
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we need to overlay that with the streets and the side streets and the depth of the side streets of how deep they're planning to go.

1086
01:38:46,626 --> 01:38:50,929
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I don't know if it's a full block back off of Salem.

1087
01:38:51,029 --> 01:38:52,751
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's like three or four parcels.

1088
01:38:52,771 --> 01:38:54,092
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's a couple of lots.

1089
01:38:54,735 --> 01:39:05,947
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think if we could mirror that with here are the properties that we feel are vulnerable within these areas, I think that would have a big impact.

1090
01:39:06,908 --> 01:39:07,549
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a map?

1091
01:39:07,609 --> 01:39:09,311
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there anything we can reference point?

1092
01:39:09,551 --> 01:39:14,776
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there is some, there's some sort of, I've seen some very loose.

1093
01:39:15,602 --> 01:39:18,403
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there's a map and there's their various presentations.

1094
01:39:18,783 --> 01:39:24,384
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no, the biggest problem I think most people are concerned about is there's no formal study of the corridor.

1095
01:39:25,005 --> 01:39:28,326
[SPEAKER_07]: So that may need to take place.

1096
01:39:28,346 --> 01:39:31,426
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, our information is the start of a study for sure.

1097
01:39:31,446 --> 01:39:36,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Our stop is the literal foundation for that study, yes.

1098
01:39:37,188 --> 01:39:38,629
[SPEAKER_00]: Dennis Dennis, are you?

1099
01:39:39,170 --> 01:39:39,810
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you listening?

1100
01:39:39,871 --> 01:39:43,614
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have the boundaries of this corridor?

1101
01:39:44,375 --> 01:39:46,216
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that written anywhere that we can look at?

1102
01:39:46,236 --> 01:39:51,461
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm pretty certain it's on the I mean, I don't.

1103
01:39:51,681 --> 01:39:56,285
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have not worked on that in the slightest, but I can ask around if you actually better idea.

1104
01:39:56,346 --> 01:40:00,169
[SPEAKER_01]: Send me like an actual list of kind of what you're looking for and then I can make sure it gets the right person.

1105
01:40:00,770 --> 01:40:00,870
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

1106
01:40:02,607 --> 01:40:08,582
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's probably the best way to make sure that I phrase it correctly instead of just trying to paraphrase.

1107
01:40:09,223 --> 01:40:10,406
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, we'll do that.

1108
01:40:13,454 --> 01:40:16,416
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, great permit subcommittee.

1109
01:40:16,436 --> 01:40:18,497
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a bunch of stuff that we're working through.

1110
01:40:18,537 --> 01:40:23,140
[SPEAKER_07]: Jen's sort of holding down the fort on permits, asking for lots of information.

1111
01:40:23,160 --> 01:40:25,941
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to refrain from commenting this month.

1112
01:40:25,961 --> 01:40:31,445
[SPEAKER_07]: There'll be some discussion with the building department on how that's proceeding, but Jen's handling it.

1113
01:40:33,126 --> 01:40:33,506
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I?

1114
01:40:34,206 --> 01:40:35,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you will.

1115
01:40:35,467 --> 01:40:37,128
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm quite confident that you will.

1116
01:40:38,649 --> 01:40:38,829
[SPEAKER_07]: So.

1117
01:40:40,956 --> 01:40:44,818
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, if you need any backup, let us let us know, but I don't think you will.

1118
01:40:47,639 --> 01:40:53,022
[SPEAKER_07]: CPA projects, I don't have anything to report on Thomas Brooks Park other than we hired the archaeologist.

1119
01:40:53,062 --> 01:40:58,705
[SPEAKER_07]: We're just sort of waiting for them to get started for better for better weather.

1120
01:40:59,906 --> 01:41:04,348
[SPEAKER_07]: I did start a conversation with tree work, but a.

1121
01:41:04,768 --> 01:41:14,073
[SPEAKER_07]: heard through the grapevine that there was a little bit of hesitancy on the city's part to help out with any sort of bid documents or anything like that.

1122
01:41:14,173 --> 01:41:22,018
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm sort of researching what the best way to go about bidding out the tree work because that's sort of the largest component of this

1123
01:41:24,961 --> 01:41:36,636
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've, I've taken to not reinventing the wheel though and pulling a couple of communities that have done projects like this so as soon as they report back to me on how they've sort of handled things, then we'll go from there.

1124
01:41:40,102 --> 01:41:43,583
[SPEAKER_07]: for survey and planning projects.

1125
01:41:43,663 --> 01:41:45,883
[SPEAKER_07]: The consultants are underway with Sagamore Vale.

1126
01:41:45,923 --> 01:41:54,746
[SPEAKER_07]: They pulled together their phase one and two products, which they're going to focus on the area right behind City Hall.

1127
01:41:56,146 --> 01:42:00,107
[SPEAKER_07]: That is the neighborhood, Oakland, Water Street, Chestnut Street, that sort of thing.

1128
01:42:00,167 --> 01:42:02,047
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a lot of pre-1875 buildings.

1129
01:42:04,628 --> 01:42:06,370
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll be the focus of their project.

1130
01:42:06,430 --> 01:42:09,712
[SPEAKER_07]: And now the next phase is to determine which buildings they're going to actually inventory.

1131
01:42:11,454 --> 01:42:14,997
[SPEAKER_07]: We did get our grant in for Hastings Heights.

1132
01:42:15,397 --> 01:42:18,380
[SPEAKER_07]: So if all goes according to plan, we

1133
01:42:22,536 --> 01:42:25,679
[SPEAKER_07]: we will be able to hopefully get that MHC grant.

1134
01:42:26,099 --> 01:42:34,046
[SPEAKER_07]: We were asked to provide a little bit more funding so that the state could spend a little bit more of their match because they don't have a lot of applicants this year.

1135
01:42:34,787 --> 01:42:35,888
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was beneficial.

1136
01:42:35,948 --> 01:42:40,292
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're getting a little bit more for every dollar that we put into it.

1137
01:42:41,172 --> 01:42:48,798
[SPEAKER_07]: There was an inquiry that came in concerning a house on, was it Mystic Street?

1138
01:42:49,838 --> 01:42:53,161
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the home of Reverend John Pierpont.

1139
01:42:54,222 --> 01:42:57,004
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm wondering if the commissioners think it might be a good idea.

1140
01:42:57,164 --> 01:43:01,907
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be inventoried as part of this project and there was an inventory form done for it in the 70s.

1141
01:43:02,688 --> 01:43:08,632
[SPEAKER_07]: I wondered if it might be a good idea just to update the inventory form now rather than wait.

1142
01:43:10,998 --> 01:43:11,678
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fine with that.

1143
01:43:12,199 --> 01:43:12,379
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1144
01:43:12,399 --> 01:43:16,380
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, I'll order that.

1145
01:43:20,022 --> 01:43:22,403
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so that project's ongoing.

1146
01:43:25,985 --> 01:43:27,605
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have anything else for old business.

1147
01:43:27,685 --> 01:43:28,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there anything I missed?

1148
01:43:30,465 --> 01:43:34,567
[SPEAKER_00]: No Ryan, can you since I was late and apologies to the rest of the board?

1149
01:43:34,587 --> 01:43:38,029
[SPEAKER_00]: Did we table 140 Summer Street for the sign?

1150
01:43:38,049 --> 01:43:40,711
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, and what happened with Wilson?

1151
01:43:42,171 --> 01:43:44,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Was not not preferably preserved.

1152
01:43:46,194 --> 01:43:46,434
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

1153
01:43:51,176 --> 01:43:54,418
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks, just taking notes great meeting minutes.

1154
01:43:54,958 --> 01:43:55,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Peter sent out meeting minutes.

1155
01:43:57,557 --> 01:44:00,719
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, there's a typo in my name, Peter, in the beginning.

1156
01:44:02,180 --> 01:44:02,841
[SPEAKER_00]: My last name.

1157
01:44:05,583 --> 01:44:06,243
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm offended.

1158
01:44:06,264 --> 01:44:10,266
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice try, Peter.

1159
01:44:10,287 --> 01:44:11,547
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't get fired from this job.

1160
01:44:11,567 --> 01:44:16,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, he's muted.

1161
01:44:22,716 --> 01:44:23,817
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll take a motion to approve.

1162
01:44:24,557 --> 01:44:25,538
[SPEAKER_07]: Peter, you're muted.

1163
01:44:26,167 --> 01:44:27,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I lost my screen there for a minute.

1164
01:44:27,989 --> 01:44:28,589
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard though.

1165
01:44:29,210 --> 01:44:30,811
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, um.

1166
01:44:33,133 --> 01:44:35,435
[SPEAKER_07]: Pending that correction, I'll take a motion to approve.

1167
01:44:37,376 --> 01:44:39,278
[SPEAKER_00]: Motion to approve meeting minutes from January.

1168
01:44:39,298 --> 01:44:40,979
[SPEAKER_00]: 1 2nd.

1169
01:44:40,999 --> 01:44:47,624
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, going around the room as I see it.

1170
01:44:47,664 --> 01:44:47,945
[SPEAKER_07]: Peter.

1171
01:44:48,905 --> 01:44:49,146
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1172
01:44:50,054 --> 01:44:50,554
[SPEAKER_07]: And Kit?

1173
01:44:51,015 --> 01:44:51,255
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1174
01:44:51,895 --> 01:44:52,355
[SPEAKER_07]: And Lenny?

1175
01:44:52,915 --> 01:44:53,136
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1176
01:44:53,676 --> 01:44:54,056
[SPEAKER_07]: And Jen?

1177
01:44:54,636 --> 01:44:54,876
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1178
01:44:55,417 --> 01:44:55,757
[SPEAKER_07]: And Doug?

1179
01:44:56,197 --> 01:44:56,497
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1180
01:44:56,977 --> 01:44:58,518
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, 5-0 approved.

1181
01:44:59,479 --> 01:45:00,079
[SPEAKER_07]: Any other business?

1182
01:45:01,900 --> 01:45:06,682
[SPEAKER_00]: Ryan, we've gotten a couple of comments here in the chat.

1183
01:45:07,282 --> 01:45:09,783
[SPEAKER_00]: Linda, would you like to unmute yourself and speak?

1184
01:45:09,823 --> 01:45:12,225
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like you'd have something to say about 31 Wilson Street.

1185
01:45:16,647 --> 01:45:17,207
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you hear me?

1186
01:45:17,807 --> 01:45:18,088
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

1187
01:45:18,108 --> 01:45:18,408
[SPEAKER_00]: Go right.

1188
01:45:18,428 --> 01:45:20,288
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we get your name and address for the record, please?

1189
01:45:20,308 --> 01:45:25,710
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, my address is the West Mall in Toronto, Canada.

1190
01:45:28,912 --> 01:45:33,533
[SPEAKER_09]: And I am a grandchild of the Granfields who lived at Wilson Street.

1191
01:45:34,614 --> 01:45:35,874
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was very interesting.

1192
01:45:35,894 --> 01:45:40,116
[SPEAKER_09]: I totally am glad a new family is going to have a new start on that plot.

1193
01:45:41,196 --> 01:45:45,958
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think I'll just read off what I wrote in my email to Ryan.

1194
01:45:48,249 --> 01:45:51,813
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to correct some of the material I heard during the discussion just now.

1195
01:45:52,774 --> 01:45:57,378
[SPEAKER_09]: It's hard to believe, but yes, 11 people lived in that small house.

1196
01:45:58,219 --> 01:46:04,484
[SPEAKER_09]: My grandparents, my great aunt, all Irish immigrants, my father and his seven siblings.

1197
01:46:05,537 --> 01:46:15,549
[SPEAKER_09]: When the family moved from Charleston to Charlestown rather to Fulton Heights in the 1920s, it was to what we would now call a tar paper shack.

1198
01:46:16,550 --> 01:46:21,256
[SPEAKER_09]: Not much to live on, but hard workers, some of the youngest children were born in that building.

1199
01:46:21,977 --> 01:46:22,177
[SPEAKER_09]: In the 1930s,

1200
01:46:24,179 --> 01:46:31,482
[SPEAKER_09]: 39, number 39 in the house next door, yes, were dismantled schoolhouses that Boston was selling off.

1201
01:46:32,243 --> 01:46:37,905
[SPEAKER_09]: You had to move it in pieces and reconstruct on a basement you built.

1202
01:46:38,325 --> 01:46:41,327
[SPEAKER_09]: The team helped build the stone cellar.

1203
01:46:42,567 --> 01:46:44,888
[SPEAKER_09]: They used what they had to build that home.

1204
01:46:44,908 --> 01:46:48,490
[SPEAKER_09]: A wood stove provided the heat in the center of the house.

1205
01:46:49,753 --> 01:46:53,854
[SPEAKER_09]: I would be interested in seeing or reading the fire information referred to tonight.

1206
01:46:53,934 --> 01:46:54,394
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1207
01:46:55,294 --> 01:47:02,996
[SPEAKER_09]: No one has mentioned the fact that there is a historic sign in front of the house, put up in a city ceremony in front of the house in 2015.

1208
01:47:03,936 --> 01:47:05,717
[SPEAKER_09]: Two of the veteran brothers were there.

1209
01:47:06,597 --> 01:47:11,458
[SPEAKER_09]: All six brothers served in World War II, and a seventh served in Korea.

1210
01:47:12,638 --> 01:47:18,720
[SPEAKER_09]: What I'll add is the Archdiocese of Boston, there was a ward hand-drawn

1211
01:47:19,861 --> 01:47:27,631
[SPEAKER_09]: calligraphy award that was in my grandparents' living room, signed by Richard Cardinal Cushing.

1212
01:47:28,012 --> 01:47:32,518
[SPEAKER_09]: They had the most sons in the archdiocese serving in World War II.

1213
01:47:33,780 --> 01:47:34,661
[SPEAKER_09]: We cherish that.

1214
01:47:35,714 --> 01:47:41,955
[SPEAKER_09]: The Granfield family, well, we hope the sign will not be removed when the new home is constructed.

1215
01:47:42,675 --> 01:47:46,216
[SPEAKER_09]: The Granfield family rose from the poverty through honest hard work.

1216
01:47:46,716 --> 01:47:58,779
[SPEAKER_09]: The sons became teachers, lawyers, plumbers, electricians, and my Aunt Mary, always single Aunt Mary, became the assistant city clerk of Medford for decades until her retirement.

1217
01:47:59,499 --> 01:48:01,860
[SPEAKER_09]: They were also instrumental in the building of St.

1218
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:03,400
[SPEAKER_09]: Francis of Assisi Church.

1219
01:48:04,971 --> 01:48:11,795
[SPEAKER_09]: I will gladly help correct information errors that were in the report I saw online.

1220
01:48:15,377 --> 01:48:18,139
[SPEAKER_09]: Good luck to the builder and to the new family.

1221
01:48:19,180 --> 01:48:21,421
[SPEAKER_09]: Our family was on that property for over 100 years.

1222
01:48:23,042 --> 01:48:24,563
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's good to see the change.

1223
01:48:25,863 --> 01:48:27,224
[SPEAKER_09]: They carved that shack.

1224
01:48:27,304 --> 01:48:30,885
[SPEAKER_09]: I have pictures of that shack actually that I didn't even know existed.

1225
01:48:30,905 --> 01:48:33,346
[SPEAKER_09]: It was in the side what's now the side yard.

1226
01:48:34,146 --> 01:48:39,048
[SPEAKER_09]: After both my parents died in 1995, I came across a bag of negatives.

1227
01:48:40,168 --> 01:48:41,789
[SPEAKER_09]: And when I printed the negatives,

1228
01:48:43,202 --> 01:48:45,102
[SPEAKER_09]: all that history was revealed.

1229
01:48:46,563 --> 01:48:52,944
[SPEAKER_09]: The last uncle died age 96 in April of 2024.

1230
01:48:53,964 --> 01:49:02,386
[SPEAKER_09]: And I interviewed him for two years, periodic calls, and learned a lot of things I hadn't learned.

1231
01:49:03,446 --> 01:49:05,886
[SPEAKER_09]: He was supposed to be interviewed by Dean Morris.

1232
01:49:06,966 --> 01:49:09,607
[SPEAKER_09]: He believed that no one paid attention in North Medford.

1233
01:49:11,283 --> 01:49:12,844
[SPEAKER_09]: We're always forgotten, he said.

1234
01:49:13,364 --> 01:49:20,068
[SPEAKER_09]: So Dee was all set up to interview him, but then he was sick, and then they couldn't get their schedule together, and then he died.

1235
01:49:20,088 --> 01:49:24,810
[SPEAKER_09]: And he knew all those family names in that whole area.

1236
01:49:26,091 --> 01:49:27,351
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just want to thank you.

1237
01:49:31,380 --> 01:49:34,261
[SPEAKER_09]: one set of grandparents to Canada, here I am back here.

1238
01:49:34,281 --> 01:49:37,121
[SPEAKER_09]: I am a historian with 32 books.

1239
01:49:37,941 --> 01:49:40,162
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why I'm interested in what you do.

1240
01:49:40,822 --> 01:49:54,405
[SPEAKER_09]: And I very much appreciate, I know you can't save every single building in Bedford, but it's been pleasant listening to you discuss how much you love it, I can tell.

1241
01:49:54,425 --> 01:50:00,526
[SPEAKER_09]: I love to go in there every Saturday morning, sitting with those uncles on that little back stoop.

1242
01:50:01,627 --> 01:50:05,031
[SPEAKER_09]: They used to be apple orchard when they tore down the shack.

1243
01:50:05,091 --> 01:50:15,483
[SPEAKER_09]: They put some apple trees in and we used to have our annual Easter picture was taken in amongst the apple blossoms in the side yard at Nana's.

1244
01:50:16,063 --> 01:50:16,784
[SPEAKER_09]: So again,

1245
01:50:17,625 --> 01:50:17,845
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

1246
01:50:18,105 --> 01:50:20,346
[SPEAKER_09]: The house is historic for our family.

1247
01:50:21,166 --> 01:50:23,727
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not historic for Medford.

1248
01:50:24,947 --> 01:50:27,147
[SPEAKER_09]: But a lot of good came out of it.

1249
01:50:27,167 --> 01:50:29,668
[SPEAKER_09]: And yes, it was like an army barracks in that attic.

1250
01:50:29,748 --> 01:50:31,489
[SPEAKER_09]: They just had a bunch of cots.

1251
01:50:32,109 --> 01:50:33,789
[SPEAKER_09]: And the boys slept up there.

1252
01:50:34,349 --> 01:50:37,050
[SPEAKER_09]: And the dining room became Mary's bedroom.

1253
01:50:37,650 --> 01:50:40,271
[SPEAKER_09]: And my grandparents had another bedroom.

1254
01:50:40,631 --> 01:50:42,471
[SPEAKER_09]: The bathroom was horrible.

1255
01:50:43,412 --> 01:50:43,972
[SPEAKER_09]: Horrible.

1256
01:50:45,293 --> 01:50:48,955
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a front door on the stairs up to the attic.

1257
01:50:49,876 --> 01:50:56,321
[SPEAKER_09]: That little piece of step, you could barely get your butt on it as a kid, but that's where kids had to sit.

1258
01:50:56,521 --> 01:50:57,521
[SPEAKER_09]: And you went to visit.

1259
01:50:57,541 --> 01:51:00,163
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a porcelain table.

1260
01:51:00,223 --> 01:51:03,926
[SPEAKER_09]: We all took a pencil and we drew pictures on that table.

1261
01:51:05,307 --> 01:51:07,589
[SPEAKER_09]: First time I saw people not,

1262
01:51:09,277 --> 01:51:10,938
[SPEAKER_09]: having a silverware drawer.

1263
01:51:12,519 --> 01:51:13,920
[SPEAKER_09]: There was so little space.

1264
01:51:14,361 --> 01:51:18,984
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a bucket of spoons and knives and forks in the middle of the table and everyone helped themselves.

1265
01:51:19,584 --> 01:51:21,586
[SPEAKER_09]: And the best thing was to get to go there.

1266
01:51:21,606 --> 01:51:24,908
[SPEAKER_09]: I left my wedding flowers with my great aunt when I got married.

1267
01:51:25,684 --> 01:51:30,046
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I moved to Canada 51 years ago, and I've been visiting every time.

1268
01:51:30,086 --> 01:51:37,129
[SPEAKER_09]: The last visit to that house on Wilson Street was in 2022, and I had lunch with my uncle.

1269
01:51:37,470 --> 01:51:40,651
[SPEAKER_09]: And I knew that was the last time I was going to leave that house.

1270
01:51:41,131 --> 01:51:50,976
[SPEAKER_09]: So again, all the best to those wonderful, the wonderful family that's going to have that place that brought up such a great generation of people.

1271
01:51:51,556 --> 01:51:52,757
[SPEAKER_09]: And I thank you very much.

1272
01:51:53,813 --> 01:51:55,094
[SPEAKER_13]: That was fabulous, Linda.

1273
01:51:55,134 --> 01:51:55,594
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1274
01:51:56,014 --> 01:51:58,156
[SPEAKER_13]: You've got to write all that down.

1275
01:51:58,176 --> 01:51:59,036
[SPEAKER_09]: Linda, thank you.

1276
01:51:59,056 --> 01:51:59,817
[SPEAKER_09]: That was amazing.

1277
01:51:59,837 --> 01:52:00,597
[SPEAKER_09]: Get into the form.

1278
01:52:03,059 --> 01:52:07,482
[SPEAKER_09]: I got my camera moved, so thank you very much.

1279
01:52:07,562 --> 01:52:10,404
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just nice to meet you all.

1280
01:52:10,704 --> 01:52:13,286
[SPEAKER_13]: Great stuff that you're doing.

1281
01:52:14,406 --> 01:52:18,569
[SPEAKER_10]: That was a lot of great information, especially about the relocated school houses.

1282
01:52:18,789 --> 01:52:19,869
[SPEAKER_10]: It was two of them.

1283
01:52:20,310 --> 01:52:20,650
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1284
01:52:20,990 --> 01:52:21,931
[SPEAKER_09]: There were two houses.

1285
01:52:27,694 --> 01:52:32,237
[SPEAKER_09]: The one next door, I think it's a pinkish color, I can't remember.

1286
01:52:32,257 --> 01:52:40,762
[SPEAKER_09]: The one next door, my grandfather's cousin Patrick, he ran over and bought the other schoolhouse that was for sale.

1287
01:52:41,943 --> 01:52:51,489
[SPEAKER_09]: I was told Roslindale by my uncle, but they said that they actually got carts and horses and they dismantled them.

1288
01:52:51,529 --> 01:52:56,011
[SPEAKER_09]: When they brought the houses back to Wilson Street up on top of that rock,

1289
01:52:58,162 --> 01:53:03,183
[SPEAKER_09]: There was some fellow in the neighborhood who had done riveting for the Navy.

1290
01:53:04,223 --> 01:53:08,724
[SPEAKER_09]: And he came over, because they were all teens, trying to put this back together.

1291
01:53:08,744 --> 01:53:13,905
[SPEAKER_09]: And he showed them how to rivet.

1292
01:53:15,346 --> 01:53:15,606
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1293
01:53:17,466 --> 01:53:21,027
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the only way poor people would have had a home.

1294
01:53:21,067 --> 01:53:25,668
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder if there was a series- Two nights, nobody wanted to live there.

1295
01:53:27,139 --> 01:53:27,519
[SPEAKER_09]: Pardon?

1296
01:53:28,139 --> 01:53:39,722
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say there was a series of metal flashing on the roof where it looked like they joined sections of roof where they had cut them off to move the sections of building.

1297
01:53:39,762 --> 01:53:47,404
[SPEAKER_07]: So I wonder if that's where they learned how to rivet into the side of the roof with all the metal that was there.

1298
01:53:47,424 --> 01:53:48,764
[SPEAKER_10]: It could have been.

1299
01:53:49,564 --> 01:53:50,925
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, there were some interesting cuts in there.

1300
01:53:53,989 --> 01:54:00,431
[SPEAKER_09]: October 22, when I was last there, the roofers had come to put in a new roof.

1301
01:54:00,952 --> 01:54:04,633
[SPEAKER_09]: And he was just like beside himself, like, look at all the noise they're making.

1302
01:54:06,254 --> 01:54:08,114
[SPEAKER_09]: To him, that house was heaven.

1303
01:54:08,915 --> 01:54:09,295
[SPEAKER_09]: Heaven.

1304
01:54:10,155 --> 01:54:13,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, he always thought, oh, you know, this would be so great.

1305
01:54:13,337 --> 01:54:20,000
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, someone, when I go, someone could come and move in here and he'd be sitting there going, no, it's not going to happen.

1306
01:54:20,581 --> 01:54:24,723
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's just what it represented, because he was born in the shack.

1307
01:54:24,903 --> 01:54:27,184
[SPEAKER_09]: And when I say shack, I mean shack.

1308
01:54:27,864 --> 01:54:30,406
[SPEAKER_09]: They, like, took out trees and

1309
01:54:31,226 --> 01:54:32,807
[SPEAKER_09]: just bits and pieces.

1310
01:54:32,847 --> 01:54:37,529
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like a junkyard in the photographs because they were just saving what they could find.

1311
01:54:38,230 --> 01:54:44,653
[SPEAKER_09]: And Chicken Run and the whole thing was all in that small area that you see is the side yard.

1312
01:54:45,253 --> 01:54:49,776
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know when the garages went in, but one of the uncles had a Model A

1313
01:54:50,828 --> 01:54:56,093
[SPEAKER_09]: junkie car that is now, someone shipped it to Ireland to some of their relatives.

1314
01:54:56,533 --> 01:54:57,474
[SPEAKER_09]: They must be loving it.

1315
01:54:59,776 --> 01:55:07,083
[SPEAKER_09]: But scrappy people, honest, loyal, religious, Kennedy lovers.

1316
01:55:07,483 --> 01:55:09,805
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my Lord, the Kennedy stuff in the house.

1317
01:55:13,096 --> 01:55:24,965
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, an assistant city clerk, I have a copy of my birth certificate that my aunt got for me when she, Mary Granfield, a lot of people come in and say, oh, she signed our wedding certificate, oh, she signed this.

1318
01:55:25,806 --> 01:55:35,814
[SPEAKER_09]: So history loving family, learned to drive up in the quarry with the illegal car, the boys all went driving in the woods to get their license.

1319
01:55:36,394 --> 01:55:36,834
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, this,

1320
01:55:37,615 --> 01:55:39,596
[SPEAKER_09]: A million stories from Fulton Heights.

1321
01:55:40,116 --> 01:55:44,297
[SPEAKER_09]: So now it's time for someone else to make new stories on that property.

1322
01:55:44,677 --> 01:55:48,118
[SPEAKER_09]: And the gravestone there is just a junk piece of stone.

1323
01:55:48,218 --> 01:55:53,599
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want anyone thinking someone's buried under that piece of granite out in the side yard.

1324
01:55:53,960 --> 01:55:58,121
[SPEAKER_09]: So if anyone at the builder asked, I would love to talk to the builder.

1325
01:55:58,701 --> 01:56:03,302
[SPEAKER_09]: Because when he talked about the beans, I have no clue what he's talking about.

1326
01:56:04,402 --> 01:56:06,143
[SPEAKER_09]: We weren't allowed in the basement.

1327
01:56:07,110 --> 01:56:10,415
[SPEAKER_09]: even when we were like four.

1328
01:56:10,435 --> 01:56:14,681
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like typical Irish, I will say.

1329
01:56:16,341 --> 01:56:19,162
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything you ask, they didn't want to answer you.

1330
01:56:19,362 --> 01:56:20,782
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you need to know that for?

1331
01:56:21,603 --> 01:56:22,483
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I guess I don't.

1332
01:56:22,603 --> 01:56:24,143
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, that discussion's over.

1333
01:56:24,624 --> 01:56:31,106
[SPEAKER_09]: So I found out what I could from this last uncle and bits, pieces from the rest of them.

1334
01:56:31,666 --> 01:56:37,948
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just want to see that sign, the Granville Brothers Corner, which isn't even a corner.

1335
01:56:39,128 --> 01:56:46,258
[SPEAKER_09]: The mayor was there, all representatives of the armed forces, the whole neighborhood in 2015.

1336
01:56:47,060 --> 01:56:49,703
[SPEAKER_09]: There should be pictures around.

1337
01:56:49,723 --> 01:56:50,424
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what's funny?

1338
01:56:50,504 --> 01:56:53,409
[SPEAKER_09]: The newspaper never came and covered it.

1339
01:56:54,593 --> 01:56:56,674
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, seven sons in one family.

1340
01:56:56,694 --> 01:56:59,076
[SPEAKER_13]: Is the sign on the property or is it on the street?

1341
01:56:59,616 --> 01:57:00,937
[SPEAKER_07]: It's on the street.

1342
01:57:00,977 --> 01:57:02,738
[SPEAKER_07]: It's there.

1343
01:57:03,178 --> 01:57:04,218
[SPEAKER_09]: It's on the street.

1344
01:57:04,599 --> 01:57:09,001
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's on the street right in front of the house, one of those black and white, like the street signs.

1345
01:57:10,502 --> 01:57:14,004
[SPEAKER_09]: There's another one around a couple of blocks away too, I think on Fulton Street.

1346
01:57:15,024 --> 01:57:17,706
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, my dad delivered papers in that whole area.

1347
01:57:18,066 --> 01:57:20,127
[SPEAKER_09]: Saved enough money for his first balloon bike, $25.

1348
01:57:23,196 --> 01:57:25,778
[SPEAKER_09]: carry all those big, big papers up there.

1349
01:57:25,958 --> 01:57:27,219
[SPEAKER_09]: They all had paper routes.

1350
01:57:27,739 --> 01:57:41,710
[SPEAKER_09]: The stained glass building was a grocery store, and when he delivered papers in the winter, his coat would be like almost frozen, and he'd go in the store, and there was a potbelly stove, and the fellow would let him

1351
01:57:43,214 --> 01:57:48,116
[SPEAKER_09]: get the coat from solid, he said it actually stood up, the jacket stood up.

1352
01:57:48,776 --> 01:57:58,541
[SPEAKER_09]: And the fellow, and he also, there was a fellow named Chet, and I don't know if you know the story about Chet, who lived on Fulton Street.

1353
01:57:58,581 --> 01:57:59,921
[SPEAKER_09]: I think his son is still there.

1354
01:58:00,362 --> 01:58:04,203
[SPEAKER_09]: But he ran that grocery store, and I think it was an original First National.

1355
01:58:04,964 --> 01:58:11,567
[SPEAKER_09]: And he gave the poor people up in Fulton Heights free cabbage whenever they came in his store.

1356
01:58:12,427 --> 01:58:14,888
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, if you were starving, he gave you food.

1357
01:58:15,388 --> 01:58:20,769
[SPEAKER_09]: So Fulton Heights was very generous to very poor people.

1358
01:58:21,749 --> 01:58:26,570
[SPEAKER_09]: But I don't think you'll be poor to buy a house on Wilson Street when they build it.

1359
01:58:29,051 --> 01:58:33,412
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it will take a fair amount of money to buy what goes in place of that house.

1360
01:58:34,452 --> 01:58:35,893
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, thank you very much.

1361
01:58:37,513 --> 01:58:38,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1362
01:58:38,033 --> 01:58:38,653
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1363
01:58:39,233 --> 01:58:40,514
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye bye from Toronto.

1364
01:58:42,077 --> 01:58:42,477
[SPEAKER_07]: You later.

1365
01:58:42,497 --> 01:58:47,401
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, I don't that was a great way, I think, to end the evening.

1366
01:58:47,421 --> 01:58:51,645
[SPEAKER_07]: If there's nothing else, take a motion to adjourn.

1367
01:58:54,887 --> 01:58:55,448
[SPEAKER_07]: And a 2nd.

1368
01:58:56,969 --> 01:58:57,089
[SPEAKER_10]: 2nd.

1369
01:59:02,994 --> 01:59:04,495
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so around the room, Peter.

1370
01:59:05,336 --> 01:59:07,497
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, and kit.

1371
01:59:07,978 --> 01:59:09,559
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, and Lenny.

1372
01:59:10,160 --> 01:59:10,380
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1373
01:59:11,520 --> 01:59:11,962
[SPEAKER_07]: And Jen?

1374
01:59:12,485 --> 01:59:12,726
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1375
01:59:13,308 --> 01:59:13,770
[SPEAKER_07]: And Doug?

1376
01:59:14,493 --> 01:59:14,875
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1377
01:59:15,417 --> 01:59:16,924
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, 5-0 approved.

1378
01:59:17,065 --> 01:59:18,973
[SPEAKER_07]: We are adjourned at 9-0-4.

1379
01:59:19,174 --> 01:59:20,580
[SPEAKER_07]: Not bad, given all that we had.
