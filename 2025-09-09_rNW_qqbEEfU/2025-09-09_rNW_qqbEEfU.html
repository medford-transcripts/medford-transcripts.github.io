 <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=559.127s">Be</a>  it resolved that the Medford City Council acknowledge and celebrate National Recovery Month. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=563.493s">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=566.12s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=567.941s">Thank</a>  you for the opportunity to recognize National Recovery Month, September's National Recovery Month. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=574.043s">August</a>  31 was International Overdose Awareness Day and we were able to, I was able to attend a vigil here at City Hall in remembrance of <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=587.256s">people</a>  whose lives were lost in overdoses. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=591.858s">And</a>  it was a really sad, but really touching event. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=595.98s">We</a>  lost 14 lives in Medford due to opioid use disorder this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=601.402s">The</a>  event had purple flags placed outside to remember the people who have passed away from overdoses in the past 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=613.427s">And</a>  this month is, rather than a memorial, it's a celebration of recovery, and it reminds people that recovery is possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=623.636s">So</a>  I thought this would be a good opportunity to actually introduce a couple of our city employees whose roles in the city are to help connect residents to recovery resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=635.146s">The</a>  first is, and I'd like to bring them up as I introduce them, Chris Suma. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=641.151s">is</a>  our recovery coach in Medford and Chris's role is to <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=647.591s">help</a>  guide residents through recovery. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=651.374s">And</a>  the other is Jason Stone, who is our social worker in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=656.937s">Sorry,</a>  I wrote down Jason's job title, but I've lost it in my notes. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=660.72s">He</a>  can tell you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=662.121s">Jason</a>  also connects people to resources, all the social services resources that we have access to here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=668.665s">So</a>  I'd love to give you two an opportunity to talk about what recovery resources residents can access in City Hall.</p>

    <p>[Jason Stone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=677.997s">So</a>  yes, Jason stone social services coordinator here at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=682.301s">In</a>  terms of the resources that are available, I think the easiest way for folks to access anything is to really just reach out and call Chris and I, Chris is here with us two days a week but as he will no doubt tell you his phone is always on. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=695.573s">I'm</a>  here every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=697.935s">A</a>  lot of my work here isn't necessarily substance use related, but prior to coming to work for municipal government, I spent 20 years working in the substance use disorder treatment field. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=707.563s">So</a>  that's always been sort of my passion. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=710.346s">We</a>  try to do a lot for families. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=712.387s">We</a>  get a lot of phone calls from families, reaching out, looking for help for loved ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=717.031s">And</a>  between Chris and I, we have contacts most everywhere across the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=722.355s">at</a>  outpatient facilities, intensive outpatient, PHP programs, detoxes, sober houses. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=729.179s">We</a>  also have a recovery group that Chris can tell you more about. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=733.661s">I</a>  should probably just let Chris tell you the rest because this is like, this is his life's work.</p>

    <p>[Chris Summa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=740.593s">How</a>  are you doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=741.033s">I'm</a>  Chris, I am the recovery coach. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=744.214s">So</a>  a little about me, I have obviously lived experience, which is why I'm in this role. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=749.475s">My</a>  job is when I deal with people, I relate with them, they relate with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=753.196s">It</a>  makes transitioning into recovery much easier if somebody has done it and can show you the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=759.737s">With</a>  that being said, we work with different organizations throughout the area, the bridge in Malden, we work very closely with Malden. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=766.458s">North</a>  Suffolk Community Services, we work very closely with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=770.853s">different</a>  recovery events and stuff like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=772.715s">We're</a>  always attending, we're always pushing people to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=775.678s">We</a>  run a recovery group, I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=777.12s">We</a>  run a recovery group every Wednesday at City Hall from 4.30 to 5.30. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=781.364s">Anybody</a>  can attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=782.185s">We</a>  provide a meal and it's just an opportunity to socialize, get involved in recovery and just see that there is a way out. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=793.546s">One</a>  of the things that I just want to make clear to everybody is, this is not just for the people that are out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=800.309s">This</a>  also goes for everybody sitting in this room. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=803.23s">If</a>  anybody's dealing with any issues, please come and find me and let's talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=806.552s">If</a>  it's your friends, if it's your family, doesn't matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=808.973s">This</a>  disease does not discriminate. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=811.614s">And</a>  please reach out. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=814.255s">Like</a>  I said, I'm here Tuesdays and Wednesdays, but as Jason said, <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=818.257s">chances</a>  are if you call me on a Sunday at three in the morning, I'm going to answer because you never know when that crisis is going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=823.08s">And</a>  I want to be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=823.98s">So</a>  thank you for letting me come and share. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=825.561s">I</a>  really appreciate it guys.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=828.243s">Thank</a>  you guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=829.403s">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=830.984s">Thank</a>  you so much for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=832.385s">I,</a>  when I met Chris for the first time at the vigil, we exchanged cards and he texted me that day and his message had many exclamation points. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=845.192s">He's</a>  very passionate. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=847.734s">City</a>  employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=848.394s">So</a>  I really appreciate him coming and joining the team. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=851.437s">And</a>  I think that's really true that I think if you texted Chris at three in the morning, he would get right back to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=857.762s">Another</a>  thing I wanted to mention is September 24th, Medford City Hall will be hosting an event, recovery event. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=865.068s">It's</a>  5.30 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=866.73s">until</a>  7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=867.871s">It</a>  involves speakers from the recovery community, a live music performance, <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=872.835s">The</a>  mayor will be making a special announcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=874.696s">There's</a>  going to be a hope and remembrance luminary display and then a post-program community tables, a food truck, DJ and music and wellness activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=884.16s">So</a>  everybody's invited to that as well.</p>

prove it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1736.67s">And</a>  as much as we don't want to see you lose any business to Somerville, I think that for one Councilor, I'm a little, little leery to push anything forward when <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1748.068s">The</a>  hours that you have now are really affecting the quality of life and neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1751.992s">And</a>  I know you said that quite, you just said, quote unquote, can't make everybody happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1757.157s">These</a>  people you want to make happy, they're your neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1759.34s">So</a>  I think that's very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1761.021s">I</a>  think it's very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1762.543s">So,</a>  you know, I'm, <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1766.336s">I</a>  appreciate you wanted to move forward with the business, but I'm going to be very honest with one Councilor until I see the proof. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1773.338s">I</a>  can't support this because I have talked to the neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1776.759s">I've</a>  been there. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1777.839s">I've</a>  seen the videos. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1779.06s">I've</a>  watched them multiple, multiple times. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1782.801s">And,</a>  um, and I think I mean, maybe a year and a year ago I came in, I think I spoke to you and I said something we can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1793.644s">And</a>  I know you said you were trying, but, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1797.377s">we</a>  still haven't seen enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1798.677s">And</a>  to move forward to two o'clock in the morning now, every night, you're asking for every night at two in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1807.84s">That's</a>  something that this council really has to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1810.36s">I</a>  understand the entertainment world. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1813.121s">Well,</a>  you put in for every night, so I'm reading it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1815.381s">And</a>  I know for the entertainment, we know Thursday, Friday, Saturday is very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1820.883s">But</a>  when you talk to a resident and they see this and they're like, hold on, they wanna do this on nights that we have to go to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1827.393s">And</a>  what we have to endure in that neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1830.697s">And</a>  we have just so you know this I'm just telling you know what people approach me about, you know, and you can be, you can be defensive I understand that because it is your business your livelihood, but I just want you to understand this is what I've been hearing as a city council this is what I've been seeing from what they've sent me. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1844.18s">What</a>  you're hearing is the quality of life is really been an impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1848.423s">And</a>  listen, I've talked to residents said, listen, I understand, but there are some nights we have to, it is a business. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1854.607s">It</a>  is a business district. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1855.668s">It's</a>  zoned that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1856.409s">We</a>  have to understand that, you know, even, even the situation with the parking, people taking my parking spot in front of my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1862.073s">I</a>  understand that that's nothing you have control of. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1864.014s">Cause</a>  I know if you wanted it, you'd want more parking spots too in your location. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1868.017s">But</a>  unfortunately, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1870.327s">there</a>  are some gives and takes. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1871.688s">And</a>  for right now, and I know that until the residents behind you come up and say, you know what, it's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1878.053s">We've</a>  met with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1879.114s">Have</a>  you met with the neighbors? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1880.035s">Have</a>  you recently met with the neighbors?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1882.136s">I'm</a>  available.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1883.717s">So</a>  you have, so that's what I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1885.078s">So</a>  you hear asking for something, but the biggest concerns were that the neighbors that are really affected, I mean, whether they go to sleep at night, <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1896.345s">whether</a>  they have to put sound machines in the house because of the base. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1898.766s">I</a>  mean, these are things that I'm just sharing what they're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1901.367s">So</a>  out of full transparency, I have been working with those neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1906.148s">I've</a>  listened to them and out of all due respect until I see something different, I can't support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1912.831s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1914.131s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1915.532s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1916.112s">We'll</a>  go to some other councilors, but if you want to go first, you guys, if you want to say anything about what you've been doing or answering the councilor's questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1923.355s">We</a>  can wait to the end. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1924.475s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1925.792s">go</a>  to Councilor Lazzaro, then Councilor Collins.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1929.917s">Thank</a>  you for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1930.758s">I</a>  think the 7 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1932.299s">is</a>  a no brainer. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1933.241s">That</a>  sounds great. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1939.751s">I</a>  have gotten a lot of emails about noise disturbances from residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1944.855s">I</a>  haven't heard anything about the Great American Beer Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1947.197s">It's</a>  possible that people sometimes reach out to Councilors they already know, but I've gotten noise complaints from folks about Wendy's at Wellington, from folks about the MBTA train station. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1959.688s">I</a>  have not heard about the beer hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1962.11s">It</a>  does not mean that it isn't happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1964.031s">But</a>  that being said, <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1969.252s">If</a>  you are responsive to noise complaints, and you're following the, if you're, if you're responsive to what's happening, and if there's follow up, I think that for me, it's <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1987.446s">reasonable</a>  for a large establishment to stay open late as long as people are still attending an event or they're still there. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1998.279s">I</a>  think Medford has a history of, because of our regulations, having to ask people to leave <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2005.648s">And</a>  it's not good business and people are losing money. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2009.79s">And</a>  I wouldn't want to ask businesses to continue to do that when it's illogical and when people are then leaving or not coming at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2019.136s">So</a>  I am in favor of this, as long as you can continue to be responsive to neighbors to the best of your ability. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2030.672s">When</a>  I do get emails from people about noise complaints, I usually follow up with either, depending on who is causing the noise, if it's work or businesses, it'll be the health department or the police department that enforces that stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2044.575s">But</a>  you can always also talk to the business owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2048.096s">And</a>  there are fines if there's multiple violations. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2051.256s">I</a>  don't know if it's gone that far with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2054.777s">We've</a>  had that issue with Wendy's and their trash pickup that they've <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2059.978s">broken</a>  it a couple of times, then the trash company has to pay a fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2062.84s">And</a>  then eventually they can be charged with not being able to do business in Medford anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2067.563s">I</a>  mean, that's the sort of chain of events. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2070.025s">And</a>  if that's not occurring, I think then you're probably okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2076.789s">So</a>  I would just say thanks for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2079.751s">I</a>  think that we as a council have responsibility to our business owners to allow you to do business the way that it is logical. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2088.116s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2090.374s">Thank</a>  you Councilor Lazzaro, Council Vice President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2094.297s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2094.658s">Thank</a>  you for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2095.278s">I</a>  think obviously there's a balance to be had here between being reasonably responsive to complaints and requests and noise concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2106.308s">All</a>  of us here live in residences. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2107.909s">We</a>  know how upsetting it is when it's loud and you're trying to work, you're trying to sleep. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2112.674s">And</a>  we have to balance that with letting a commercial district be a commercial district. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2117.778s">I</a>  know that going from 11 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2119.959s">every</a>  night to 2 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2121.58s">every</a>  night in one fell swoop is a pretty big swing. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2124.241s">I</a>  think that there's a balance to be struck here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2127.642s">I</a>  would make a motion to amend this proposal to 7 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2131.664s">through</a>  2 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2132.685s">Thursday</a>  through Saturday, and 7 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2134.786s">through</a>  midnight Sunday through Wednesday, and to put a 30-, 60-, and 90-day review on that.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2139.308s">Are</a>  you guys already 1 a.m.? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2141.91s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2142.55s">They're</a>  already 1 a.m.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2143.63s">Oh,</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2146.2s">Uh,</a>  never mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2147.802s">Your</a>  hours online were different. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2151.405s">Maybe</a>  I didn't see it here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2153.346s">Um,</a>  in that case, I would support extending the two a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2157.51s">closure</a>  to Thursday through Saturday and leaving the other days the week as is.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2161.834s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2169.36s">So</a>  the motion is to amend to, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2173.765s">7</a>  a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2174.146s">to</a>  2 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2174.706s">Thursday,</a>  Friday, Saturday, and 1 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2177.369s">on</a>  Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Sunday. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2181.132s">Sunday,</a>  Monday, Wednesday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2183.395s">I</a>  guess I could have said it that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2185.857s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2191.502s">Do</a>  we have any other comments from Councilors? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2198.169s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2200.594s">Yes,</a>  on Sundays, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, it would be 7 AM to 1 AM. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2205.816s">And</a>  then on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, it would be 7 AM to 2 AM.</p>

    <p>[Alvaro Sandoval]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2216.241s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[John Shea]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2228.187s">What</a>  time do we close Monday? 11.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2231.897s">So</a>  what are your current hours versus what's your license?</p>

    <p>[John Shea]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2234.881s">Yeah,</a>  so our license is longer, but Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, we usually close around at the latest 11 right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2242.452s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2242.673s">So.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2245.597s">Councilor</a>  Leming.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2250.423s">Yeah,</a>  I was just a question for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2253.184s">Do</a>  you think, I mean, do you think that the 2 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2255.124s">to</a>  1 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2256.005s">difference</a>  from what Council Vice President Collins just suggested would make a very big difference for y'all? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2262.606s">Like,</a>  do you think that that would be an acceptable compromise in your eyes?</p>

    <p>[John Shea]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2265.227s">What</a>  was the question again, sir?</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2268.788s">Do</a>  you think that moving the Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday hours from 2 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2275.23s">to</a>  1 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2275.99s">would</a>  be an acceptable compromise in your eyes? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2280.275s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2281.256s">Yeah,</a>  I don't like to hear residents coming in and talking about noise complaints that they didn't get a response to. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2291.824s">I</a>  don't like to hear that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2293.846s">What</a>  I also don't like to hear about is a company putting a big investment into <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2302.556s">Medford</a>  in a place that we're really trying to do business development and then having it fail because the city council wasn't willing to be flexible and work with businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2313.459s">So</a>  this is, I think that this is a, this is a balancing act. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2317.94s">Um,</a>  I want to see businesses that decide to invest in our community do well. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2324.501s">And</a>  I want to do everything that we can within reason to support that effort, because it is very important for the future of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2331.823s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2340.097s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2340.598s">We</a>  will go to</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2346.256s">So</a>  I just have a frank question for you guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2350.019s">Do</a>  you think that staying open until two, you would be able to be pretty successful if you were not having the loud music on the, you know, like if an event ended, you know, if like a music event or something ended at one, but then you stayed open until two o'clock, like, can it be quieter? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2369.396s">I</a>  know that we can't like write that into the, <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2371.898s">the</a>  rules here we kind of binary but do you think that you'd be more successful if you know and would you basically sort of commit to making every effort to keep the noise down after one o'clock yes absolutely absolutely yeah yeah like no one's outside everything's off outside the lights are off so everyone's inside that would make me feel more comfortable um if like you're aware that <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2399.308s">That</a>  is an issue and making your best at like people can have as good a time as they want to indoors without the you know music layering and all that stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2408.304s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2410.468s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2412.673s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2413.894s">First</a>  of all, thank you for doing business in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2417.615s">I</a>  think the Great American Beer Hall has brought a lot of change to our city, which is good. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2423.298s">I</a>  think residents are really excited and really grateful for having it in Medford and for all the work that you guys are doing here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2430.121s">I</a>  think residents will be very excited about Nassau Donuts moving in and excited for more late night pizza, to be honest. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2440.341s">Um,</a>  I uh <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2443.559s">I</a>  had a similar question to Councilor Collins, and I'm grateful for your answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2447.061s">I</a>  guess my remaining question, this is, you know, as Councilor Leming said, it is a balancing act. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2455.226s">We</a>  have to hear, you know, the residents who aren't happy and act on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2459.288s">We</a>  also have to stand up for the residents who do wanna see this in Medford as well, but also to help businesses out. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2466.752s">And</a>  I wanna know if this 1 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2469.834s">change,</a>  you guys said it was adequate, <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2472.892s">How</a>  does that affect the competitiveness with neighboring communities? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2477.836s">Is</a>  this a good enough of a step in the right direction?</p>

    <p>[John Shea]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2484.189s">Well,</a>  going to 2am on the weekends will be a big help because we lose a lot of our crowd around 10pm 1030 to places like the burn on core the harp in Boston, and they come to us first they might order pizza and then they leave, because they want to stay out later, and those an incident recently where there's a wedding party and they are staying at the row hotel. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2506.33s">And</a>  they called us to see if they could send two buses with the party guests after the wedding to the Bayer Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2513.033s">They</a>  called at 1130. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2514.994s">And</a>  we told them, well, yeah, but right now we have a 1230 last call. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2519.397s">So</a>  they ended up taking them elsewhere that 2am. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2522.158s">So</a>  it definitely impacts us pretty, like significantly. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2525.96s">Yeah,</a>  you could definitely pull like bigger parties and stuff like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2530.218s">The</a>  other good thing is the nighttime people tend to come by way of Uber. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2534.606s">There</a>  are still a lot of people that drive, but we have way less of a parking problem at night than we do during the day.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2541.312s">Yeah,</a>  that makes a lot of sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2543.373s">And</a>  is that something that you mostly see on Thursday, Friday, Saturdays?</p>

    <p>[John Shea]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2547.115s">Yes,</a>  mostly Friday and Saturday, like Thursday nights. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2550.896s">I</a>  mean, we get a good crowd, but they typically die off earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2554.378s">And</a>  part of the reason why is a lot of the younger crowd goes to the Baron in Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2558.9s">Like</a>  we've gone there, we've seen it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2561.182s">So</a>  we're just trying to get some of that crowd to come to us because they're actually leaving to go there.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2566.525s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2566.765s">So</a>  we don't want that.</p>

    <p>[John Shea]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2568.627s">And</a>  they charge a cover there. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2569.747s">We</a>  don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2570.288s">So</a>  they're paying money to go elsewhere.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2572.489s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2574.39s">Fair</a>  enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2575.09s">Thank</a>  you for that answer for, you know, teaching a little bit about what you guys are seeing about on your side as well.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2582.195s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2582.695s">Councilor</a>  Tseng Councilor Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2584.916s">Thanks,</a>  just a little follow up. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2586.717s">I'm</a>  hoping and kind of assuming that we're going to have a 30, 60, 90 day follow up to this change so we can check in with residents and make sure that it's working out. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2598.42s">And</a>  then also wanted to say that you guys are going to have some stiff competition with Donuts with a Difference, which makes amazing donuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2605.542s">So</a>  we'll see how, as a donut person, I'm excited to do a comparison. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2610.224s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2610.824s">Perfect.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2614.498s">All</a>  right, do you have any more questions for the petitioner? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2621.182s">Seeing</a>  none, we'll go to public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2623.524s">Is</a>  there anyone else who would like to speak on this issue, either in person or on Zoom? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2627.026s">If</a>  you'd like to speak in person, you can come to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2630.168s">If</a>  you'd like to speak on Zoom, you can raise your hand and we'll come back to you guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2636.112s">Thanks,</a>  you can come to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2637.473s">Hi,</a>  name and address for the record, and you'll have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Carol O'Brien]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2640.915s">Yeah,</a>  Carol O'Brien, 49 Hancock Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2644.859s">method</a>  was that on behalf of myself, my family and the numerous residents who have generously signed the petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2651.598s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2654.185s">and</a>  we are writing to formally address the ongoing issues of loud music disturbances originated from events at the Great American Beer Hall, particularly on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights, often lasts till 12 o'clock a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2667.407s">After</a>  long work days, many of us look forward to quiet evenings to rest, and unfortunately, beginning as early as 9 p.m., the music stops. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2676.869s">It</a>  disrupts us, intrusive and deeply unsettling to the peaceful atmosphere our neighborhood has long enjoyed. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2683.81s">During</a>  the initial community zoom meeting, when asked if music would be part of the great American events on Brian's author confirmed there would be live music yes there would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2695.584s">However,</a>  he assured the community, you will not hear the music. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2699.748s">and</a>  emphasize it be contained inside the venue with all doors and windows closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2705.632s">What</a>  was not disclosed was the use of outside speakers, now I think there is eight of them, DJs and amplified sound that now frequently spills into the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2715.438s">The</a>  community was led to believe there would be minimal, if any, disruption. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2719.881s">Unfortunately,</a>  this has not been the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2723.003s">Despite</a>  requests to turn speakers inward and reduce the volume, those concerns have gone unaddressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2730.028s">The</a>  loud music, especially the deep basses from the DJ sets, has become a source of stress and frustration. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2738.153s">Many</a>  residents have resorted to using earplugs, sound machines, raising their TV volumes, turning on their ACs, <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2745.994s">and</a>  even installing triple pane windows in an effort to reclaim some peace in their homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2751.638s">While</a>  we understand the Great American Beer Hall operates as a business, our community should not have to suffer the consequences of accessible noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2761.164s">We</a>  were here first. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2762.825s">The</a>  Great American Beer Hall should make reasonable accommodation for the community, not the other way around. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2769.749s">Therefore,</a>  we respectfully request that all outdoor music be shut down at 9 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2774.757s">With</a>  any remaining performances moved indoors and fully, fully contained, so they are no longer audible to the surrounding neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2783.602s">Brian's</a>  after once said method is a loving community. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2786.923s">We</a>  asked him in the great American beer hall to reflect that love by being considerate of the very community that welcome them. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2794.25s">We</a>  had, there was an event, a private event that happened, and it lasted till one o'clock in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2801.792s">And</a>  there was DJs, and by 1.30, quarter of two, there were groups of people walking down, and parking is another issue, walking down our streets, White Street, Hancock Street, Willis Ave, loud. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2814.976s">One</a>  lady came across Hancock to Willis Ave, beeping the horn, beep, beep, beep, let off the alarm. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2820.898s">The</a>  owner came out and said, you know, what are you doing a small children and woke up the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2826.761s">The</a>  next day, I neighbor Joe was picking up solar cups, all over the trash that they, they left. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2832.804s">I</a>  spoke to a lot of the, you know, a lot of the residents and they, they don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2837.446s">hear</a>  how long the beer hall is open till it's the music that is just too loud. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2842.108s">I</a>  mean, we look on the menu and say, Oh, this is to 12 o'clock I'm like, Oh, I'm gonna be able to sleep this you know I mean it's just too loud and especially with the vibration of the DJ with the bang bang bang bang bang you hear it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2855.435s">Some</a>  one resident said he has beats, and with the beats in his ears he can still hear the vibration, bang bang bang all the way, and it's the music, it's just too loud. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2865.459s">We're</a>  100 yards away from this Brea Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2869.44s">I</a>  wish that the Brea Hall was turned the other way with the, you know, the garden would be facing the highway. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2874.305s">You</a>  know, but it's not, and it's just very, you know, it's too loud for us, and we want to live a nice quiet, you know, come home, and especially we want to relax, and you hear this, you know, and you just, it's very unsettling.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2889.516s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2889.876s">Yeah,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2890.977s">I</a>  spoke with our economic development director. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2892.757s">And</a>  I think he had some thoughts on the on the music specifically. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2896.659s">So</a>  I do see his hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2898.22s">But</a>  before I go to him, is there anyone else who wants to speak on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2900.941s">He</a>  was here or on zoom if anyone else would like to come to the podium and talk about this, their experience or, or raise your hand on zoom before I go to our economic development director.</p>

    <p>[Matthew Anders]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2910.566s">Hi,</a>  how you doing, Matt?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2917.238s">Yeah,</a>  name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Matthew Anders]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2919.139s">Matthew</a>  Anders, White Street, 14 White Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2924.001s">So</a>  yeah, so I've lived in the area for a couple of years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2927.063s">I</a>  love the Medford transformation, what's happened downtown, the Irish bar, you know, the pizza restaurant, all that stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2932.785s">Very</a>  excited for the Great American Beer Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2934.566s">I</a>  actually go, I used to go quite a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2938.168s">I</a>  love the live music, had lots of pizzas there. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2940.269s">I</a>  mean, there were a lot of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2942.767s">So</a>  for me, it's like what happened was one night I was, I get very, like I need to have a sleep. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2947.269s">I</a>  literally could hear the bass coming into my bedroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2950.01s">I</a>  live on like the fourth floor in a brand new build with like insulation that's up to code. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2956.992s">It's</a>  a very, very deep insulation. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2958.413s">That's</a>  the bass. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2959.912s">My</a>  career happens to be in audio visual. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2961.573s">I</a>  fit out a lot of offices and we put a lot of acoustic panels into the places to actually absorb the sound. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2968.477s">So</a>  I think one of the key issues is acoustic paneling in the place to absorb some noise, so the noise doesn't travel out. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2975.18s">So</a>  obviously to do that, you mentioned earlier about these 30, 60, 90 days reviews. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2979.642s">I</a>  would like to see what is the decimal rating if you're down the road and you actually take decimal ratings at certain times. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2985.384s">Is</a>  that an acceptable rating? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2986.624s">You</a>  have a state law that has certain ratings. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2989.285s">This</a>  would not pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2990.605s">So</a>  I think, like people have said here, the key is not the amount of time it's open to. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2995.267s">If</a>  it's open till 2 AM and they fix the acoustic problem, everyone's going to be very, very happy and there's going to be no concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3001.469s">And</a>  you'll find that the neighbors will probably start going there. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3004.05s">So</a>  right now it's fixing the sounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3005.631s">I</a>  don't believe it's the outdoor speakers myself, because they're small sounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3008.594s">It</a>  tends to be the louder bass noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3010.695s">And</a>  it tends to be on the Fridays when we have the DJs, not so much when it's the live bands as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3015.619s">So</a>  I think looking into that, having an understanding, having someone that attends with a professional audio visual background that can make recommendations before these hours are approved, I believe will actually help. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3027.428s">And</a>  yeah, like I said, I'm happy to go back. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3029.83s">If</a>  I start sleeping normally, I'll be their first customer back. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3032.913s">So</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3034.969s">That's</a>  it.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3036.11s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3036.77s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3040.852s">Is</a>  there anyone else who'd like to speak on this matter? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3042.793s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3043.954s">Go</a>  to the podium, name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3046.756s">You</a>  have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Micah Kesselman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3048.597s">Sure,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3049.217s">Micah</a>  Kesselman, 499 Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3052.579s">I</a>  did not come here expecting to talk about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3056.221s">But</a>  I do want to note that I am our representative on the Massport Logan <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3064.301s">relationship</a>  committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3066.042s">And</a>  one of the things we deal with a lot is airplane noise complaints. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3069.824s">And</a>  we do a lot of educational stuff on the deleterious effects of noise, of high noise levels on residents, especially at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3077.789s">So</a>  if your establishment is getting like this amount of complaints about it, like this is a big deal and it actually has negative health outcomes potentially on the local residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3091.218s">It</a>  is something to really take seriously, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3094.066s">I</a>  what I think might be a good compromise is if they would agree to sort of heightened fines if there is a noise complaint that is filed and the cops show up and actually assess that there is noise during this sort of trial period. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3113.446s">so</a>  that they can basically put their money where their mouth is and that they actually are trying to address this issue that can actually have pretty negative health outcomes for people who are experiencing it and who are sensitive to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3124.913s">So</a>  that's just sort of my thoughts on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3127.134s">I</a>  am not super forward, like I have not heard, had issues with the noise, but I'm also like five blocks or more away from the beer hall, but it is nice to have a business like that there. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3137.141s">So</a>  I would like to see it not, <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3141.965s">screw</a>  it up and make it viable, so.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3146.869s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3147.389s">All</a>  right, I'm gonna go to our economic development director. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3152.473s">Oh,</a>  yeah, I'm gonna go to the economic development director on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3155.835s">Sal,</a>  if you could just let us know what your thoughts are and if you could talk about some of the restrictions on live music that we talked about, or music in general.</p>

    <p>[Sal Di Stefano]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3167.524s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3169.205s">Mr.</a>  President, can you hear me?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3171.413s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3172.054s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3172.414s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3173.155s">But</a>  we can hear you.</p>

    <p>[Sal Di Stefano]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3174.456s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3174.777s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3175.237s">I</a>  appreciate the opportunity to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3180.548s">on</a>  behalf of Great American Beer Halls petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3184.071s">What</a>  I do want to say is I hear everybody loud and clear about the need to be a good neighbor and to take measures to reduce noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3198.181s">What</a>  I do have to say is that <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3203.765s">When</a>  I did receive a complaint recently regarding a live event, I immediately contacted <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3214.692s">John</a>  and Brian, and they took action immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3218.013s">They</a>  took responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3220.534s">I</a>  saw an email that went out from their general manager to employees, and one of the things that they voluntarily agreed to was to stop outdoor music at 9 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3234.258s">and</a>  to shut all the doors and <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3236.219s">including</a>  the big garage door that's at the building to keep the noise inside. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3244.526s">Also,</a>  at our request, they did alert patrons via signage and verbally asking them to be respectful of neighbors as they exit the premises. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3259.458s">Um,</a>  so they took those immediate actions. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3263.699s">Um,</a>  I, I definitely understand where, uh, Councilor scar Polly is coming from, um, needing to see the proof. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3272.421s">What</a>  I can do, what I can say is from every conversation I had, um, they have learned from their mistakes. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3280.383s">They</a>  want to be a good neighbor. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3282.323s">Um,</a>  and on the, for economic development, we want to be good to businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3287.985s">We</a>  want, <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3289.125s">meant</a>  for it to be known as a place that will support our small businesses and we also want to be competitive. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3297.246s">It's</a>  not fair to our businesses if people could just cross the municipal lines and go to our neighboring communities and enjoy beverages later just because we aren't taking action. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3315.749s">We're</a>  not modernizing our <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3326.293s">We</a>  lost you at modernizing. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3328.796s">Sorry,</a>  could you hear me Councilor? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3330.558s">Your</a>  service isn't great. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3331.719s">We</a>  lost you after the word modernizing. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3347.52s">So</a>  sorry, I'm in a bad patch driving my son home from a soccer game in West Roxbury. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3353.863s">I</a>  apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3356.044s">Bottom</a>  line is that I hope we can find a compromise here and support this petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3364.368s">And</a>  I thank everybody for their consideration.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3371.471s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3374.653s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3377.318s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3378.218s">Go</a>  to Vice President Collins and then Councilor Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3381.66s">I</a>  have a few questions myself.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3384.581s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3384.861s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3385.181s">I</a>  just wanted to note that it sounds like at every step, Great American Beer Hall has tried to be responsive to specific suggestions and solutions that have been proposed to the business, and I do want to note that, and that gives me a feeling of optimism that if we kind of collaboratively reorient toward solutions that maybe, you know, I think the effort is there. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3403.407s">What</a>  we need to do now is make sure that the <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3407.248s">You</a>  know, the noise amelioration is really we're using the strategies that work the best. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3411.491s">I</a>  heard it's heartening to know that we have an actual AV engineer in the community I'm sure he's not the only one. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3416.994s">Maybe</a>  a next step here is to take a look at what are the interventions that are really making a difference what are the ones that seem like they should make a difference but because of sound waves. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3424.88s">They're</a>  not having the effect that they should. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3427.681s">Um,</a>  I've been to, uh, many a, you know, brewery style event hall myself that is just incredibly loud because of how the walls are and how echoey it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3438.264s">So</a>  it seems like there's, um, ground here that we haven't tread on yet that might be having a bigger effect, um, than what's already been tried. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3445.886s">So</a>  maybe we can, I think if there's a strong commitment and review period that we can try the things that seem like they'll have a better success rate, maybe we can have the extended hours with decreased complaints at the same time.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3459.831s">Thank</a>  you, go to Councilor Leming then Councilor Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3462.552s">Councilor</a>  Leming.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3463.952s">Yeah,</a>  this is definitely one of those things where I would take the review period, very seriously, but it does, it does sound like, you know, adding, adding more noise wouldn't necessarily help out the business, because that's not what people were asking for by what you told by the anecdote that you just said but <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3483.457s">extending</a>  the hours and doing something about the noise would overall help out both the businesses and the neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3491.999s">So</a>  I do see this as kind of two different things, and I don't really see it that we need to, you know, I mean, punish a business for having some growing pains with the neighboring community, which does sound like it had a detrimental effect on <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3510.183s">Um,</a>  you know, I don't want to, um. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3511.184s">Many</a>  of the neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3512.225s">But</a>  if we can just, you know, be responsive to that sort of sort of work with them compromise. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3517.349s">Um</a>  I don't I mean, City Council can drag its feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3521.052s">So</a>  I think that if we were to wait another. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3523.634s">Six</a>  months, um, to approve these hours, um, with, uh, Uh, and with the <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3538.727s">on</a>  business. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3539.507s">So</a>  to me, in my mind, the best solution is to have the review period, have it very carefully see if the effects of the very loud noise are still there. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3555.355s">And</a>  if the neighbors still notice it, but at the same time help out the businesses that are opening up nearby so that they don't all go over to the burn and we can start stealing business from Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3566.781s">Hopefully,</a>  but no, I'd like to thank both you as well as the residents from the neighborhood for coming over and telling their story. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3577.988s">And</a>  hopefully, you know, you'll be able to get the money for maybe a sound engineer to improve the acoustics of the place, like, you know, have some of those like foam panels on the side so that it doesn't quite go out into the community as much. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3593.496s">But</a>  so thank you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3599.03s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3600.331s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3603.253s">I</a>  hope that you hear that I certainly and many members of the councilors really want you to be successful and want to approve these hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3610.299s">I</a>  think for me personally, I want to see improvements on the neighbor's experience before increasing the hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3620.086s">I</a>  think that's just how I feel personally. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3622.368s">So</a>  I don't think I'm gonna vote in favor of these hours right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3628.113s">I</a>  am not a sound engineer, but I really took to the comments saying that, you know, maybe hiring somebody for some small consulting to really dig deep into how you can ameliorate those issues and working with the neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3643.725s">And</a>  I would love to see you come back if this does not pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3647.909s">And</a>  because I want you to be successful and</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3667.748s">Thank</a>  you, just one second. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3677.397s">All</a>  right, we'll go back to you guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3680.52s">If</a>  you wanna talk about maybe additional mitigation, you might be willing to consider around the sound. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3686.55s">You</a>  know, I was in there with you guys when it was a shell, and then I was in there right after you had opened. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3692.433s">And,</a>  you know, it's a big space. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3694.734s">And</a>  I mean, we're really glad that it's been a successful business. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3697.876s">But</a>  one thing I will say, I have noticed when I've been in there is it's a big space, and there's a lot of noise bouncing around. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3702.838s">So</a>  it doesn't surprise me that we've had some of the noise, maybe, you know, that that building's maybe not capturing all of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3709.922s">So</a>  I was wondering if maybe you could talk a little bit more about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3713.022s">The</a>  garage door is our biggest issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3715.303s">So</a>  when the garage door is shut, it's like night and day. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3719.605s">You</a>  can't hear outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3720.446s">When</a>  the door is open and we have the DJ or the band up back, it just flows down and it goes into the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3728.033s">The</a>  key for us is getting that door closed at 9pm every night, which we were not doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3732.556s">So</a>  it was a learning curve, something that we talked to with Sal, and we came back and said, hey, we got to get this door shut. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3739.581s">And</a>  that's the only way that we're going to mitigate the noise going down the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3743.524s">And</a>  how long have you been close to that? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3745.265s">Like</a>  a week and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3746.306s">A</a>  week and a half.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3746.986s">Yeah,</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3748.562s">If</a>  you don't mind, I do and I normally wouldn't do this to just someone who spoke in public comment, but to our friend who is the sound person. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3755.947s">Have</a>  you noticed a difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3757.688s">Since</a>  the garage doors been closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3762.071s">Last</a>  Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3768.673s">If</a>  you could come, could you come to the podium? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3770.114s">Sorry,</a>  I gotta, if we're gonna say more than a thumbs up or a thumbs down, we gotta hear your name.</p>

    <p>[Joe Chaves]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3774.497s">I'm</a>  Joe shelves and I live on White Street and it's gotten better in the past week or two, the noise better. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3781.522s">But</a>  you know, again, the noise continues, not only their hours, which is, I understand that we want their business to succeed. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3788.746s">No</a>  question about that because I want my life to succeed also. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3792.489s">So</a>  all the people that go there late, they come out of there, <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3797.465s">half</a>  in a bag, and they come out of there yelling and screaming with their mugs and cups and everything else, and they drop it on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3805.63s">Well,</a>  on my street, at the end of the street, which meets Willis, the trash was there for a week, and it's beer bottles, it's all kinds of crap. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3815.077s">I</a>  have to pick it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3815.837s">I</a>  like to keep my street clean, because I think that reflects the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3820.0s">But</a>  you know, I walked around the neighborhood actually this past weekend, horrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3825.514s">I've</a>  been there for almost 40 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3828.895s">This</a>  is the worst. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3830.796s">I</a>  couldn't believe what I saw in the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3833.617s">I'm</a>  not saying they're neat. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3835.118s">I</a>  have to admit to that, because I don't see as much on their side. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3838.699s">But</a>  I think it's the neighborhood in that area that it's gotten worse and worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3843.541s">So</a>  I think something needs to be done about cleaning it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3847.322s">I</a>  used to see trucks coming around once a month sweeping the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3851.063s">I</a>  don't see anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3852.084s">If</a>  I don't sweep my street, it sits there. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3855.458s">Unfair,</a>  I'm a taxpayer, they pay taxes, and I don't know if you guys live in a neighborhood, so if you don't, you don't know what goes on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3864.824s">I</a>  do, almost 40 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3867.326s">It</a>  used to be beautiful, not now. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3871.448s">Again,</a>  I want them to succeed. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3874.11s">I</a>  respect them and I hope they respect me and they respect the neighborhood, but that's not the right way, all right?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3880.874s">Thank</a>  you, I appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3884.559s">So</a>  it sounds like it might be somewhat better. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3888.382s">But,</a>  you know, it's only been doing it, you've only had one, one DJ night since then, it sounds like so, you know, a lot of sample sites to go on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3898.529s">You</a>  know, I had spoken with our economic development director, I think, if we put the condition of no outdoor music and closing the door at 9pm, 9pm, and also would recommend <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3913.195s">maybe</a>  a little bit of a different look, 30 days, 90 days and 180 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3916.718s">So</a>  that would be October 9th, December 9th and March 9th. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3919.94s">If</a>  we get the noise complaints, any noise complaints or code complaints. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3923.763s">So</a>  to folks, if you're hearing noise or if you are seeing something in the neighborhood, send that to the code enforcement team. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3931.828s">They</a>  will send that information to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3934.01s">And</a>  then we would be able to review those complaints at each of those junctures. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3937.672s">And</a>  if we have to go back to the 1 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3939.833s">time,</a>  if we're seeing a significant impact, <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3942.575s">That</a>  would be a way that we could take in the complaints that residents in the neighborhood are sending if there continue to be issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3948.8s">Maybe</a>  we come back and have another conversation at one of those points about additional sound stuff or some some changes that you guys have been thinking about and we can continue the conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3957.607s">But</a>  I think those would be conditions that we could we could see if this works. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3962.691s">And</a>  if it doesn't work, we could talk about more solutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3966.074s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3966.855s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3968.97s">Would</a>  someone just amend to include those conditions? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3973.532s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Sanders. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3976.214s">So</a>  we have a motion by Vice President Collins to approve as amended to 7 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3981.536s">to</a>  1 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3982.377s">Sunday</a>  through Wednesday, 7 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3983.958s">to</a>  2 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3985.078s">Thursday</a>  to Saturday with the conditions of no outdoor music and closing the large door at 9 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3991.464s">and</a>  then a 30 day, 90 day and 180 day review to request that the building department and code enforcement send complaints that they receive about this to the council so that we can, if we have to consider reverting back to the earlier hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4007.686s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4009.689s">Because</a>  I just want to dispel some rumors or whatever was said a lot of people saying people leaving your establishment with alcohol that we know that doesn't happen I know that that's not your style, I know that you're very, so I think that we, you know, I know that this. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4025.24s">If</a>  you could just elaborate a little bit that because I think people might be getting a little more concerned now that hold on one second, they're letting them leave without call. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4032.182s">I</a>  know that doesn't happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4033.202s">So</a>  if you can just help with that.</p>

    <p>[John Shea]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4035.442s">Yeah,</a>  so we have security at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4037.583s">And</a>  we have essentially the main entrance open and you can exit by the patio as well to leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4043.504s">And</a>  we have security at both doors. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4045.125s">So</a>  they're definitely not letting people walk outside with like liquor or anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4050.586s">They</a>  won't even let you leave with like a water cup at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4053.947s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4055.275s">I</a>  don't know where all the trash is coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4057.877s">I</a>  will say this probably been sometimes people are walking to our establishment and they're like pre-gaming on the way there. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4065.264s">And</a>  I think they tend to throw trash, knock them alive, but it's definitely not leaving our establishment going out.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4074.453s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4076.413s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4078.034s">And</a>  what do you guys do in regards to trash, like in the immediate vicinity of your, you know, if you see something on the sidewalk? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4084.257s">Yeah,</a>  yeah, we have, we have someone there five days a week picking up trash in the morning at our site, so we keep it very clean, that's really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4092.821s">Does</a>  that extend to like missing out maybe across the street? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4095.322s">Yeah,</a>  I do the, I do 134, 151, and 142. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4096.863s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4097.043s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4102.698s">Do</a>  we have any more questions from members of the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4105.72s">Or</a>  do we need the motion read back? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4110.684s">Seeing</a>  none, on the motion by Vice President Collins to approve as amended with conditions, seconded by Councilor Leming, and again, this would be 7 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4119.331s">to</a>  1 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4120.532s">Sunday,</a>  Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, 7 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4123.455s">to</a>  2 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4124.255s">Thursday,</a>  Friday, Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4126.237s">They</a>  cannot have outdoor music and have to close the large door. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4130.1s">They</a>  call it the garage door. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4130.981s">I</a>  said it's a large door. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4132.762s">at</a>  9 PM, and then we're going to receive complaints in 30 days, 90 days, and 180 days, any complaints that are sent to our building department and code enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4141.888s">And</a>  if we receive a significant number of complaints, we'll come back and review, pulling those later hours back. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4149.872s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Alvaro Sandoval]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4202.546s">Well,</a>  it's just we're trying to do a neighborhood coffee where you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4209.709s">That's</a>  the idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4211.229s">So</a>  I would love to speak more, but it's basically that just a neighborhood where people can gather in and enjoy a good coffee.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4271.933s">I</a>  just wanted to thank you for coming before the council today. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4275.055s">We're</a>  so excited for this business. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4277.556s">I</a>  think it's something that Medford Square is so missing. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4280.018s">You've</a>  been such an amazing patron in Medford and in guiding our development as a city as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4285.181s">You're</a>  really a team player. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4287.262s">The</a>  caffeine addict in me is really excited for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4290.824s">So</a>  I'm wishing you the best of luck.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4318.415s">Yeah,</a>  slowly but surely. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4320.236s">Putting</a>  the puzzle together.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4825.713s">Thank</a>  you for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4828.118s">The</a>  Miss McPherson had some issues with some of the paperwork, there was a communication breakdown. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4838.443s">between</a>  city departments also. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4840.764s">Um,</a>  and I just wanted to mention that one of the projects I think we as the city of Medford can continue to improve on is making it clear for people who are trying to open businesses what the smoothest way to get paperwork in order is and that <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4862.354s">We</a>  have an economic development director, Sal Giuseppino, who can help sort of walk people through stuff people don't necessarily know. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4871.158s">where</a>  he is or how he can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4875.261s">Jenny</a>  happens to know me because our kids have been in school and after school together for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4881.244s">So</a>  when something happened that she didn't know that her fire inspection was not passed because nobody told her and it wasn't passed because the rink didn't have a certificate of being allowed to exist, though it does exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4898.493s">And</a>  the rink is Medford Rec and the rink is owned by DCR. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4902.535s">These</a>  are all pieces of paper that should be easily accessible to everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4908.786s">I</a>  don't think, nobody's in trouble. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4910.207s">It</a>  just, it was like the fire approval didn't happen because the paperwork wasn't where it was supposed to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4916.41s">And</a>  then nobody told Jenny that she didn't pass the fire inspection. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4920.533s">And</a>  then it, like when she came to get the paperwork, it was not there. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4926.236s">And</a>  then she emailed me, but you shouldn't have to have, you shouldn't have to know me because our kids went to school together to be able to open a business in Medford and not lose money because you can't go to city council and get your paperwork together. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4940.255s">So</a>  I just think that we can find a way to <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4947.048s">make</a>  it possible for people who are not connected to, not that you shouldn't be able to open this, this is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4954.294s">This</a>  is excellent, I want this to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4957.457s">We</a>  should find a way to make sure that everybody who wants to open a business in Medford can do that with a streamlined process. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4963.342s">And</a>  I look forward to, I've talked with Sal about this, I look forward to working with him and helping everybody be able to do this kind of thing in a smoother way, in a simpler way. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4972.751s">We've</a>  had a lot of great businesses come before us tonight, and this is like a wonderful reflection of all the people that want to open businesses in Medford we want people to come into Medford with their businesses with their <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4986.428s">people's</a>  money that we then turn into services for our residents that we need more of. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4991.05s">So</a>  I'm really excited for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4993.972s">I'm</a>  excited for the people that are hockey parents, which I'm not one because I told my kids they can't play because there's too many pads and there wasn't any coffee before, but now maybe. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5004.918s">So</a>  thank you so much again. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5006.138s">I</a>  think that we will be able to improve the process for the future and I'm glad that we got it sorted out, but it can be better. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5015.588s">Thank</a>  you, again, thanks for bearing with everything.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5401.82s">The</a>  motion of Councilor Scarpelli to take 25 140 seconded by Councilor Tseng all those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5408.882s">Opposed</a>  motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5415.255s">It's</a>  a bit of my bare brain legal current capital stabilization fund water and sewer capital stabilization fund appropriation requests. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5423.421s">Dear</a>  president bears and city councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approves the appropriations of one capital stabilization fund and the amount of $2,346,101 and zero cents on the following items DPW $357,287 for a four wheel drive dump truck and sender with plow. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5443.313s">$300,000</a>  for design development of the seven-acre lawn cemetery expansion, $200,000 for stump removal, $180,000 for removal of displaced grave soil, $154,592 for a fleet tow truck, $100,158 for a three-quarter ton pickup truck with lift gate, $94,055 for a dump truck, $60,000 for field refurbishment, and $32,000 for a leaf vacuum and leaf box for a dump truck. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5469.176s">I'm</a>  going to pause the reading there. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5470.677s">We'll</a>  take them in order. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5471.478s">We'll</a>  do DPW facilities, fire, general, police, and then we'll come back to water and sewer. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5479.524s">So</a>  let's start with the DPW.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5485.549s">Good</a>  evening, everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5486.51s">Tim</a>  McGiven. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5487.031s">We</a>  have our fleet director here as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5490.013s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5490.213s">And</a>  fleet superintendent, Michael Wenzel. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5495.759s">So</a>  it's pretty straightforward. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5497.741s">There's</a>  a lot of things on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5499.603s">So,</a>  you know, we can probably just go to questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5502.106s">A</a>  lot of this stuff is routine. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5504.909s">Except</a>  for a few notable things. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5507.491s">The</a>  seven acre lawn cemetery expansion that's a design development project basically to take that from <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5514.807s">a</a>  conceptual cost estimate to a design that we would then have to figure out a way to fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5521.375s">So</a>  that's pretty interesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5523.077s">Happy</a>  to take questions on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5524.538s">And</a>  if folks want to see more, I have a presentation as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5528.063s">But</a>  it's up to you folks on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5530.585s">Stump</a>  removal, pretty, pretty basic. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5532.546s">We're</a>  going to try to remove another 40 or 50 stumps. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5536.227s">So</a>  that's pretty straightforward. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5538.528s">The</a>  displaced grave soil. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5540.808s">As</a>  you know, we did more than this last year in this <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5546.471s">This</a>  should be basically it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5548.553s">This</a>  will be enough to clear that lawn. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5552.156s">I</a>  call it lawn 13 for development into burial space. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5558.663s">And</a>  then I'll note the fleet tow truck too that Mike can talk more about. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5561.705s">That's</a>  a tool that we believe we need for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5564.948s">And</a>  he can tell you more about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5566.827s">The</a>  field reimbursement, we're looking at field two at Tufts Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5572.928s">It's</a>  a softball field. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5574.669s">We've</a>  done a lot of work on baseball fields. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5576.569s">We've</a>  done some work on the outsides of softball fields, for example. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5581.15s">Hickey</a>  got some improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5582.811s">So</a>  we want to try to refurbish one field. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5586.051s">And</a>  let's see. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5587.532s">Anyway,</a>  those are the notable things. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5588.772s">Everything</a>  else is pretty routine. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5590.573s">And</a>  we have Mike here for questions as well.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5594.451s">Do</a>  we have any questions on the DPW items in front of us? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5597.893s">Councilor</a>  Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5600.435s">I'm</a>  just curious, how many stump removals do we normally do, like within our budget per year?</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5606.319s">Let's</a>  see, it depends. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5608.241s">For</a>  this type, which includes sidewalk, for this amount of money, we'll probably get about 45, maybe 50 stumps. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5615.439s">maybe</a>  a little bit less, depending on the market.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5617.781s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5618.041s">No,</a>  I understood that you said it was being 40 and 50. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5619.542s">But</a>  like, yeah, when we normally not asking for capital funds, like within our normal budget, like how many do we normally?</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5627.868s">However</a>  many trees we take down, because we take down the stump too. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5631.811s">And</a>  then we do additional, I don't have the number. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5635.085s">on</a>  hand, but I can tell you what it is later on.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5637.849s">Okay,</a>  but my follow up question is about when these stumps are removed, and these are, I assume sidewalk trees?</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5645.861s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5646.181s">Predominantly?</a> </p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5646.962s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5647.503s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5648.244s">Will</a>  the tree pits be left open?</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5650.99s">Some</a>  of them, yes, they will remain, or we'll put them back is a better way to put it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5655.133s">We</a>  have new standards now for tree pits, so if it doesn't fit our new standards, we won't put it back. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5660.256s">It</a>  just doesn't make any sense, usually, and the reason that the tree is dead to begin with is usually because the tree pit was done wrong.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5668.041s">Great,</a>  but those tree pits are not gonna be filled over with cement as part of this?</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5672.404s">They</a>  may very well be, so for example- If there's the two small ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5675.066s">Correct,</a>  if we do not wanna put a tree there again in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5678.981s">we</a>  will either, it'll be concrete, asphalt, or brick, although I don't think we have any brick in this particular contract.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5685.924s">And</a>  if I may ask, these places where there were trees, where there is now a planned non-replacement of the tree, that stuff is all gonna be in the final, the big, I'm missing the term, the tree, not the inventory, but the tree master plan that we're developing?</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5704.55s">Yes,</a>  so in a general sense for sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5706.873s">I</a>  don't think it gets drills down to the specifics on recommendations for a specific site, but they're going to be recommendations on how we plant streets, you know spacing between trees different canopy types and sizes. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5721.768s">species,</a>  all that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5723.23s">Right</a>  now we have mostly Norway maples, and they're on their way out. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5728.478s">And</a>  it's kind of lopsided. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5731.142s">So,</a>  you know, we can replace those with more appropriate canopy trees based off of that report.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5737.112s">Great,</a>  tiny follow up question. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5738.813s">Do</a>  you know if the tree report and the master plan will include information about which tree pits are currently too small for us to replace those trees? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5749.362s">Because</a>  it sounds like, am I correct that that's the size of the tree pit is what, like, if it's too small, that's probably why the tree is dead. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5755.307s">And</a>  then let's not keep that tree pit.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5757.889s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5758.369s">There</a>  will be information in that sort of master plan about which of our tree pits are too small?</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5763.587s">Yes,</a>  I'm cautious to say how much detail but we have a full inventory now with lots of data and that data is included the tree pit size, whether or not it's in a bird strip or in a two by two hole, things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5778.302s">So,</a>  and also whether or not the roots are bulging out the diameter of the tree to approximate its age. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5785.236s">species,</a>  obviously, all of these things were collected in the inventory. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5789.357s">So</a>  it may not say it in the report specifically what to do about it, but it's used for data to generally guide the master plan for our canopy.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5798.24s">Thank</a>  you so much.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5798.881s">You're</a>  welcome.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5800.521s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5801.722s">On</a>  that point, <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5803.805s">Are</a>  there alternative non-cement, non-concrete, non-asphalt uses that we could use a tree pit for? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5810.97s">Like,</a>  could we put smaller shrub-like plantings or flowers or something that's not a tree?</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5816.714s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5817.575s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5818.115s">And</a>  that's going to be part of... <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5820.838s">this</a>  master plan for urban forestry because you only have so much space in your street scape. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5828.602s">And</a>  one of the things we're trying to look at is what do smaller and different shaped canopies and trees look like and how do they fit together and how do their root systems interact? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5838.968s">So</a>  that's all part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5840.168s">Great.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5840.969s">Now,</a>  are we going to pave over the tree pits that no longer fit our sizing and then we'll go back in the future and <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5847.883s">break</a>  that again or what are we going to do?</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5849.764s">That</a>  could happen, but that's not that big of a deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5851.545s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5851.825s">So</a>  if, say, for example, we have a tree that's getting paved over and now it's concrete sidewalk, if later on we decide that we're going to put a tree in that strip somewhere and we're going to cut a tree pit in, that's not a big deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5864.873s">We'll</a>  just cut it in and we'll do it right this time, is what I'm getting at. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5868.936s">So</a>  engineering is even <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5871.657s">I</a>  don't know exactly if we've implemented any, but working on tree pit details for projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5878.022s">So</a>  as we move forward, we'll get better at it.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5880.724s">Is</a>  there any kind of intermediate solution, like a small garden instead of just going to... Yes.</p>

    <p>[Kevin Foley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5887.169s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5887.65s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5887.91s">I</a>  think we're thinking about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5889.591s">And</a>  I know that when our tree warden selects species to plant, it's not a mono-species situation she's selecting. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5897.947s">And</a>  now we have actually information that will guide us in what species we're selecting, where we're planting them, and how we're planting them, and how they're spaced apart on the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5907.632s">So</a>  that's all gonna be new. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5910.034s">I</a>  mean, we're used to seeing, you know, 30 feet tree, 30 feet tree, but the future is gonna be different. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5914.796s">We</a>  can't do it that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5915.617s">It</a>  doesn't work.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5916.117s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5918.098s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5918.798s">I'm</a>  gonna go to Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5919.759s">And</a>  then I have a couple more questions on the cemetery, but I'll come back to Councilor Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5924.291s">I'll</a>  help you be the transition to the cemetery. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5926.692s">But</a>  before that, I think it would be my preference if for the tree pits that seem like they could be good candidates for like filling in the green space that we don't jump to filling them with concrete. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5939.815s">I</a>  know it's not too difficult to go back, but I think for the heat island, if I can just for time and resources, I think, you know more about this than I do, but it'd be my gut instinct to say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5952.967s">we</a>  think should be maybe more careful about which ones we put the patch in first. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5958.751s">I</a>  know there's some residents who weren't super happy in Hillside about some of the tree pits that were filled in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5968.037s">My</a>  question about the cemetery is that for this expansion project, do you have an estimate of how many more spaces we would get from this acreage?</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5980.979s">Yeah,</a>  approximately, it was in the couple of hundreds, 250, 260 additional bots. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5988.641s">So,</a>  you know, and the numbers we're talking about are, you know, another 10 years or so, maybe 15 years of burial space. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5998.103s">So</a>  those are the numbers that we're using in discussions, but we're at the concept phase right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6003.645s">So</a>  the, you know, some of the estimates are 300,000 to continue design. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6010.623s">to</a>  get us to construction documents. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6012.344s">And</a>  then it could be like, you know, a few million dollars, three, maybe more, three and a half, to actually develop it and build it out, depending on the scope of work and the size of the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6022.088s">And,</a>  you know, efficiencies, maybe we do something with NBELP, for example. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6028.47s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6030.831s">Does</a>  that estimate, the 10 to 15, include both the removal of the soil, you know, the <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6037.257s">the</a>  giant pile of dirt that's next to the lots right now in the back of, and the expansion, or is that just the expansion into the current conservation land? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6047.941s">So</a>  the 300k would just be the seven acre design. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6050.842s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6051.383s">Yep.</a> </p>

    <p>[Teda DeRosa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6051.923s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6052.423s">I</a>  meant more your 10 to 15 year estimate of lengthening the service on the cemetery. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6058.349s">That</a>  would just be the seven acre expansion. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6060.874s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6062.698s">Do</a>  you have cemetery questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6064.963s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6070.012s">Okay,</a>  let's stick with the cemetery and then we'll come to the leaf vacuum. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6072.413s">It's</a>  just like 30 things on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6073.634s">I</a>  don't want to jump in.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6074.475s">I</a>  also have a short presentation that I could plug in on my computer if you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6079.658s">It</a>  shows the concept plan itself and some of the estimate information, generally speaking the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6085.161s">It's</a>  up to you guys though, like I said, how much time you want to spend on it.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6088.763s">Yeah,</a>  I have a couple questions and then maybe we can go to the discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6093.385s">I</a>  also see we have the president of M-BELT here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6095.626s">I</a>  don't know if just listening or planning to say something. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6100.307s">Just</a>  listening, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6103.368s">I'm</a>  also on the M-BELT board. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6104.869s">We've</a>  talked about this a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6106.349s">I've</a>  talked with my fellow board members about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6109.311s">I</a>  have some concerns about the expansion. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6111.791s">I</a>  guess my main question is if we could just talk about kind of the big picture here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6116.444s">Right</a>  now, when are we thinking that Oak Grove is going to no longer be able to have new folks buried there, which four to five years is the estimate that we're using right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6128.628s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6129.629s">And</a>  that includes the if we remove that soil pile is that add some time.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6136.835s">That</a>  doesn't include that, but that's also not a huge lawn, but that will buy us some time.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6143.84s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6144.781s">And</a>  then if we were to, and then kind of this project that we're talking about, and maybe if folks have more questions about it, I've reviewed it pretty extensively, so if folks want to look more into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6155.148s">this</a>  would be, you know, when the Brooks Estate, when all of that conservation negotiation happened in the 90s, there's essentially some land currently used for like some storage of materials and the stumps, dumping of stumps, that's on what I think most folks going into there would consider <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6173.985s">Kind</a>  of on the Brooks estate side of the access drive, but it's cemetery land and has some cemetery use this would be expanding the cemetery into that land so be kind of changing that from more of like the forested more conservation use to more like the cemetery use on the other side of the access drive. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6191.832s">Is</a>  that fair fair.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6194.583s">The</a>  only clarification I would make is that it's not conservation land. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6198.068s">It</a>  is a separate parcel. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6199.45s">Yeah,</a>  so the boundary is pretty clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6203.556s">Yeah,</a>  and I'm glad and Doug is nodding his head that correcting me. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6209.485s">And</a>  you know we're really kicking off, this would really be kicking off a design and I think we're taking the collaborative approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6215.227s">We</a>  have a concept plan that was used really to create an estimate and to create an idea of massing the site and how much road is it, you know, how many lawns is it, things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6225.631s">And</a>  we do need a service area, we do need a maintenance yard because right now, <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6230.091s">We</a>  don't have one. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6231.693s">And</a>  I think that negatively impacts the whole area. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6234.696s">So</a>  I think figuring out the best way to do that on this operational land is part of this project as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6243.165s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6244.045s">And</a>  there are restrictions to this property. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6247.303s">the</a>  buffers, the way that the stones can be laid. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6251.325s">So</a>  it's, and you know, one of the things that we've already talked about with the M-Belt is trying to work with the natural landscape a little bit more and try to retain connectivity with the pedestrian hiking paths that are through the parcel, kind of respecting that piece of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6270.574s">But,</a>  you know, it is something that is, <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6273.415s">is</a>  that I would say we should try to continue to move forward as a city, just because we have this four to five year timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6281.678s">And</a>  right now everything is just on paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6283.619s">As</a>  far as this project goes, it's the phase of figuring out how to get $3.4 million and actually build this thing is a different discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6295.263s">But</a>  this phase of a project is when you really do the due diligence and iron out design and really understand <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6302.193s">what</a>  it means and how to move it forward.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6307.577s">I</a>  appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6308.397s">Yeah,</a>  I think along those lines, you know, I have some <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6313.065s">I</a>  appreciate what you know the collaborative approach and trying to adjust the design I think that's really important, I think, maybe even going further down the road and figure out how we can align. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6322.373s">You</a>  know some of the funding that and belt has received the works of state land trust has received for the access drive. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6329.92s">I</a>  think maybe turning this into a more collaborative project overall for the whole area. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6334.274s">might</a>  be the way to go down the road here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6336.475s">Because</a>  I personally, you know, the concept design and where we've been at so far, you know, I personally have some concerns, you know, as a Councilor, as someone who just uses the area, as a Berks estate board member about the concept. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6352.381s">It</a>  sounds like we're already talking about making some changes as we move through the design phase. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6357.083s">But</a>  I think there are some real questions to be raised about, you know, if we're extending the life of the cemetery not very long, but making permanent changes to, you know, some of the <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6369.069s">one</a>  of the largest, certainly the largest city-owned green space, you know, in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6374.114s">How</a>  do we balance that? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6376.956s">And</a>  if we can do it in a way that really enhances that space and makes it more accessible, you know, for both the Brooks Estate Land Trust and for the cemetery, you know, maybe there's a maintenance, maybe we do the maintenance yard and shed and <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6390.929s">But</a>  we can do that in a way where, you know, that can help with the new access drive. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6395.912s">Those</a>  kinds of things, I think, are considerations that I would want to take into account. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6399.094s">And</a>  I guess, saying all that, my question is, you know, do you think that those considerations and those collaborative conversations are something we're going to be able to incorporate in the design process that will be funded through this appropriation?</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6412.335s">Yes,</a>  I think as long as all the interests are met, as far as why, why we're doing the project and of course yeah, there's no buildings really involved with this project, it's a landscape project. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6424.102s">So,</a>  you know, it's grading some pavement, some preserving large trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6431.847s">it's</a>  doing it doing it the right way and I will say that those questions that you have are really good questions and you should be asking those questions and I think the way the best way to get the answer to those questions is to continue down the design process and the collaboration process with our neighbors and see if there are some efficiencies with you know joining projects and looking at it more holistically I get that I would just keep in mind you know the <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6459.112s">these</a>  things tend to get drawn out if you continue to do that and pile on. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6464.795s">But</a>  I think this is a situation where we can define this project pretty well. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6468.917s">It's</a>  the road, it's some improvements up at the site, maybe some improvements to the conservation land, clean up work or whatever, and making some operational space for us because I think that was identified as an operational need for the city back when this fight was had.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6484.985s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6486.447s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6486.627s">And</a>  I, and I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6488.148s">And</a>  I think more just what I'm saying is since we're starting the conversation tonight, this is kind of the, the first, the first appropriation on the design. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6495.873s">Like</a>  I want to have the full scope of the conversation in front of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6500.356s">You</a>  know, who knows if I'll be, be around for those conversations here or not, but I, you know, I would have a very hard time voting for an appropriation of three or $4 million for something that looks a lot like the concept that came out. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6513.844s">I'd</a>  have a much, <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6515.225s">I</a>  think, and I think a lot of folks have a much. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6517.5s">you</a>  know, I think it would be a better project and a better proposal if we were able to incorporate more of multiple uses, not just that this is not just a cemetery expansion, but this is about what does that part of the city, that city-owned land, whether it's M-Belt or the cemetery land, look like for the long-term future? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6536.244s">Because</a>  it's a really significant investment. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6537.765s">And</a>  I think if we're saying, well, it's $3.5 million to keep the cemetery going for eight or 10 more years, that's an argument, but we have a lot of competing interests for city resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6545.907s">Maybe</a>  that's not an argument that <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6547.847s">wins</a>  the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6548.407s">If</a>  it's we're going to spend five or $6 million to keep the cemetery going and keep, you know, really enhance access to this, you know, 50 acres of open space for the next 200 years, you know, that's a different kind of benefit, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6563.153s">So</a>  just want to have that framing around it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6566.034s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6566.574s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6567.054s">Yeah,</a>  and I would just also say that there are other opportunities for collaboration with the Oak Grove Cemetery. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6572.56s">I</a>  think it's an incredibly valuable asset that this city has. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6575.843s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6576.544s">There</a>  are rules associated with cemetery land. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6579.187s">So</a>  we would have to, you know, maintain those rules, obviously, when it comes to access and hours and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6584.613s">But</a>  I think, you know, those could be respected in a collaborative process. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6588.877s">And</a>  there's work in the historic part that needs to happen if anybody has been up there recently, we're trying to get the roads fixed up there, which is another large project. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6599.622s">And</a>  then, you know, we're looking at two buildings that are falling apart that are historic that we need to preserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6607.926s">And</a>  I believe you know there's some public obligation there to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6611.407s">So,</a>  you know, it's a property that I'm trying to give as much attention as I can, because I know it hasn't received a ton of attention over over the decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6621.376s">So,</a>  and this is a part of it, you know, and I know that agreement and that argument was had back in the 90s, and then it's kind of just sat on the shelf. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6629.567s">And</a>  now we're kind of at hour 11, it's 1158 in the cemetery world. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6634.609s">What</a>  are we doing folks? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6636.389s">So</a>  anyway, that's how I see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6639.53s">But</a>  like your points are good. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6641.391s">And</a>  I think that discussion actually, and I'm a resident, that discussion should be had. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6646.192s">It</a>  should be ironed out. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6647.753s">So</a>  we know what we're doing with both of those properties and how to interact with them.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6652.575s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6652.995s">And</a>  I think maybe if nothing else, although I think we actually agree on a lot between the, <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6657.236s">works</a>  of state in the cemetery. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6658.816s">I</a>  think the fact that both of those areas have gone under addressed and underserved for a really long time is a point of unity. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6666.018s">Um,</a>  and you know, I think also points us in the direction of a solution in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6670.139s">So</a>  thank you for having that conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6674.68s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6675.48s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6676.24s">Leaf</a>  vacuum. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6677.92s">Councilors</a>  are Oh, Yep.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6684.082s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6685.022s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6687.534s">Is</a>  the LEAP vacuum, how is it powered?</p>

    <p>[Mike Wentzell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6690.918s">It's</a>  got a lawnmower engine on it.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6695.123s">Okay,</a>  and it's attached to the truck?</p>

    <p>[Mike Wentzell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6697.365s">It's</a>  actually on its own individual trailer. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6700.172s">And</a>  it has a tube on it, and when he sucked the leaves up, it mulches them and puts them into the second part of that, which is the box. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6708.854s">The</a>  box for a dump truck. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6709.795s">The</a>  leaf box gets mounted on the back of a pickup truck.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6712.895s">Where</a>  is it operated?</p>

    <p>[Mike Wentzell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6714.316s">That</a>  particular one will be in the cemetery. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6716.676s">In</a>  the cemetery. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6717.276s">That's</a>  for the cemetery.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6718.037s">Only</a>  for use in the cemetery? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6719.057s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6719.557s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6720.057s">So</a>  we have an ordinance about leaf blowers and still, so the gas-powered leaf blowers are not allowed in residential areas in Medford and the gas-powered ones, the very loud ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6731.383s">And</a>  just last week, I was in my own neighborhood half a block from my house driving home and I had to pull my car over and talk to a man who owns a landscaping company. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6742.345s">and</a>  tell him that it was illegal, that he was using a gas-powered leaf blower. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6745.225s">I</a>  just wanted to make sure we weren't gonna be having the city have, I think it's even in the ordinance that maybe that we can, but if this is inside the, just to be used inside the cemetery, I think it's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6758.228s">Those</a>  gas-powered sort of pieces of equipment can be very loud and chaotic.</p>

    <p>[Mike Wentzell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6761.928s">That's</a>  specifically allocated for the cemetery.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6763.749s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6764.349s">So</a>  just for cleaning up around those big spaces.</p>

    <p>[Mike Wentzell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6767.189s">Yeah,</a>  for them to do leaf pickup on large piles, stuff like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6772.13s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6772.45s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6773.61s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6775.091s">Mike,</a>  are you going to talk about the fire pickup trucks or the police cruisers? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6778.872s">Let's</a>  do that now, too, so we can get you out of here, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6781.112s">Oh,</a>  OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6781.693s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6784.153s">We'll</a>  do the fire pickup trucks, $166,000 for two pickup trucks?</p>

    <p>[Mike Wentzell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6788.995s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6790.755s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6792.095s">We</a>  got the chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6793.276s">We</a>  got you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6794.496s">What</a>  are we doing here?</p>

    <p>[Mike Wentzell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6796.197s">We're</a>  purchasing two pickup trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6799.277s">One</a>  is actually replacing. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6803.273s">a</a>  truck we just took out of service, the one that closed the boat, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6807.974s">Yeah,</a>  that was a 2001. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6809.114s">Yeah,</a>  it's replacing a 2001 pickup truck that we just recently took out of service for repairs, that it's too far gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6818.756s">And</a>  then the other one is going to be a command vehicle. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6822.897s">It's</a>  going to be the backup to the command vehicle that's replacing a toddler.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6828.798s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6830.098s">Anything</a>  else you want to add, Chief Evans?</p>

    <p>[Todd Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6833.721s">Nope,</a>  Mike just pretty much hamming it out there.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6836.823s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6837.504s">Pretty</a>  simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6838.365s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6839.146s">And</a>  then maybe it looks like I think for police, we also only have the cruiser. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6842.348s">So</a>  we'll take you guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6843.81s">And</a>  if you want Mike to do the talking, that's your call, but.</p>

    <p>[Barry Clemente]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6847.033s">Members</a>  of the council, good evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6851.056s">Yeah,</a>  we would respectfully ask for 3-2026. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6858.321s">police</a>  interceptor explorers, the hybrid engines. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6862.664s">These</a>  would be used to replace some of the vehicles in our aging fleet. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6866.647s">I</a>  emphasize aging. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6868.728s">We</a>  have 2014 vehicles in our fleet right now with north of 140,000 miles on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6876.314s">So</a>  I work with Mike every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6877.815s">They</a>  do a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6879.816s">They</a>  keep us running basically. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6881.702s">every</a>  day. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6882.643s">We</a>  give them a lot of business, to say the least. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6887.547s">But</a>  our plan is, right now, we have two patrol supervisor vehicles in the fleet, the 2018s. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6895.393s">We'd</a>  like to replace them. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6897.655s">And</a>  with the third one, we'd replace one of our 2014 vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6902.599s">And</a>  over the years, we've had to decommission quite a few vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6906.614s">I</a>  think we've done at least a half a dozen anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6908.875s">I</a>  think we lost five or six just in the past year. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6913.018s">One</a>  got totaled, one got hit outside the police station and it was a total. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6917.38s">And</a>  it hurts because that was a 2017 and with insurance and everything, we only got like $12,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6922.583s">You</a>  can't do anything with $12,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6926.005s">So</a>  we have some vehicles that definitely need a replacement and this will provide a big boost for the offices.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6935.473s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6935.933s">Do</a>  we have any questions on the fire and police vehicles from the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6941.694s">Councilor</a>  Leming?</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6944.134s">So</a>  this is how much you're requesting three. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6947.155s">If</a>  you had to give an estimate, how many would you say that you needed if you like had an ideal number? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6952.916s">Like,</a>  do you think three would- I'd like to get more than three, but- How many more?</p>

    <p>[Barry Clemente]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6958.637s">How</a>  many more? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6959.157s">How</a>  many can you give me?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6960.617s">Well,</a>  we can't give you any, but we just want to know.</p>

    <p>[Barry Clemente]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6962.938s">I'd</a>  love to see four. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6966.056s">One</a>  of the issues that we have, and I know that we talked before, and we hit the nail on the head with what we were talking about, and we learned. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6974.98s">These</a>  vehicles aren't on the lot, so what happens is we have to order them, and that takes a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6980.423s">It</a>  really, really takes a long time.</p>

    <p>[Mike Wentzell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6981.903s">Especially</a>  since COVID.</p>

    <p>[Barry Clemente]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6982.924s">Yeah,</a>  and it's just backlogged, and it's just... So we have to order these vehicles, and these vehicles themselves then have to be outfitted. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6989.487s">It's</a>  not like buying a normal vehicle. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6991.067s">We're</a>  talking about putting lights <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6993.174s">electronics,</a>  computers, decals, the blue lights, storage in the back, cages in the back. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7002.116s">That</a>  takes a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7003.276s">We</a>  had an order a couple of years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7005.457s">It</a>  took, I mean, we were giving the fire department a run, because I know it takes them a long time to get an engine. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7010.278s">It</a>  took us over a year to get that cruiser on the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7014.199s">We</a>  actually had to pull it from one of the places that we had it at and put it in a different location, because they couldn't fulfill the order. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7022.523s">And</a>  this, this is something we have to be aware of, because we order these cars, let's say we order them tomorrow, we're not going to see them for a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7029.428s">So</a>  in the meantime, we have this aging fleet getting older.</p>

    <p>[Mike Wentzell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7033.431s">And</a>  unfortunately, since COVID, all the, all the manufacturers, the vehicle manufacturers, they've changed the way they do things. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7041.997s">I</a>  could call them up. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7043.402s">tomorrow</a>  and say, order me three trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7046.104s">And</a>  they would show up in 10 to 12 weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7048.466s">Now</a>  the manufacturers require me, they have an order bank window. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7052.869s">So</a>  I have to order everything I want in this two month time frame. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7058.274s">And</a>  then the vehicles don't show up for like six, seven months. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7061.596s">Then</a>  we have to send them to the upfitter, which usually takes two or three months more. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7065.599s">So</a>  these particular vehicles, we will probably see those in May. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7070.482s">uh,</a>  that's, that's a, that's a timeframe estimate to have them delivered May, June timeframe of next year, if they get approved tonight.</p>

    <p>[Jason Stone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7078.07s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Mike Wentzell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7078.67s">So</a>  it just, unfortunately due to COVID, it just, it turned my world upside down.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7085.056s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Mike Wentzell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7085.357s">So,</a>  but they're, they're badly needed.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7088.28s">Yeah,</a>  no, I mean, we hear you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7089.981s">The</a>  only thing I can do is give you less cruisers. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7091.928s">Yeah,</a>  that's the only thing the council can do we can we can just cut, we can increase we can amend we can just cut or say no, or say yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7101.439s">Hey,</a>  even then, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7102.88s">So</a>  if we, I think having a conversation about getting on a schedule, especially given the scheduling concerns that are now an issue for you with the timeframe of ordering these things.</p>

    <p>[Mike Wentzell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7114.365s">I</a>  will say we've done pretty good the last couple of years with the mayor's office and everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7120.148s">And</a>  it seems the way we're getting a schedule where we get X amount every single year and we can rotate the stock and it seems to be working out good right now.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7127.871s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7128.972s">That's</a>  helpful information I have too. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7131.413s">All</a>  right, I'll go to Councilor Callahan, and then I got one more question for you, Mike. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7135.236s">Councilor</a>  Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7136.496s">So</a>  I'm just curious. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7137.437s">I</a>  note that we're replacing the fire truck from 2001. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7139.758s">We're</a>  replacing the police cars from 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7143.241s">And</a>  one from 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7145.662s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7147.303s">I</a>  know I didn't own a car for 20 years, and then I bought a 20-year-old car. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7151.006s">That</a>  was six years ago, and my car this summer, finally, 26-year-old car, finally died. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7155.669s">So</a>  I bought a 15-year-old car. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7158.871s">But</a>  I'm curious about, like, is this a thing that we will see, like, that the trucks are going to be, you know, 25 years before we replace them, but the cars are going to be seven years, the police cars are going to be seven years? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7172.819s">Like,</a>  just looking at that sort of differential between, like, the age of the vehicles, clearly there are different kinds of vehicles.</p>

    <p>[Mike Wentzell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7179.924s">So</a>  what I try to do is I kind of have a master plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7185.257s">Believe</a>  it or not, with the police and fire admin cars, I tried to do 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7193.421s">The</a>  DPW vehicles, the average expected life is 15 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7198.844s">Takes</a>  a lot of work to make them last that long, but we do our best. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7205.148s">With</a>  the police vehicles, my estimate is seven to eight years. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7209.71s">And</a>  by that time, they've <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7212.902s">They</a>  cost more to repair than they're worth. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7216.103s">So</a>  those are the timelines that I use. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7220.524s">Unfortunately,</a>  I've only been in this position six or seven years, and we're just getting this ramped up now. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7229.267s">In</a>  the past, <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7231.191s">hold</a>  on to vehicles for 20, 25 years and, you know, duct tape and bubble gum just to get them to plow, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7237.974s">So,</a>  um, and that's where like that 2001 comes in. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7242.695s">It</a>  was the top of the fleet and it got moved down and down and down. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7246.457s">And</a>  then eventually it rendered useless.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7249.918s">So</a>  I guess I'm just, I'm just looking ahead thinking, are we going to need like <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7256.523s">the</a>  age of the fire trucks, are they all like way, and I know we've been through this before, but we're gonna need to be spending on fire trucks more because those are so much older.</p>

    <p>[Mike Wentzell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7267.628s">As</a>  the years goes on, we're gonna be needing to spend money, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7271.37s">So</a>  when it reaches a certain age, then we begin to stop the process of replacing it.</p>

    <p>[Barry Clemente]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7278.762s">Those</a>  police cruises, a lot of them are going 24-7. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7281.284s">Around</a>  the clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7283.566s">Yeah,</a>  those things don't shut off. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7284.828s">They're</a>  not shutting off, so their life expectancy's not as much, unfortunately.</p>

    <p>[Todd Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7292.995s">And</a>  when you're talking about the fire trucks themselves, those are now like five-year wait times. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7298.54s">The</a>  fire trucks are now, it's about a year going through the process of speccing out the truck. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7304.343s">And</a>  then four years from the date of signing the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7307.647s">So</a>  it's tough to actually start preparing for planning the new fire trucks because of these long wait times now that are going on.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7317.738s">And</a>  we've done two or three engines and a ladder in the last five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7321.602s">Does</a>  that sound about right?</p>

    <p>[Todd Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7324.918s">We</a>  just recently replaced our engine four because that one just happened to be on a lot somewhere that we were actually able to acquire because of a different department that couldn't fit in their station. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7336.912s">So</a>  we were able to make that truck work luckily, and we grabbed that one right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7341.357s">But</a>  we ordered a couple engines back in 23. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7347.207s">we</a>  were told that those are gonna arrive here at the end of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7351.428s">And</a>  we were recently told that now those are gonna be bumped up to lucky October or November of next year, they told us now, so.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7363.751s">Do</a>  we have any other questions on the vehicles in this appropriation? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7368.878s">Mike,</a>  I just have one question for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7370.461s">How</a>  are you guys doing down there in fleet staff wise with the volume of work that you guys have to do?</p>

    <p>[Mike Wentzell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7375.611s">Staff</a>  wise, we're struggling. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7377.815s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7380.177s">We're</a>  getting by just for obviously I'm very shorthanded. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7383.84s">Try</a>  and do the best we can with what we got. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7388.865s">And</a>  I'm just waiting for applicants to be honest. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7393.429s">But</a>  I got two guys down there and they're busting their butt. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7397.653s">They're</a>  getting it done. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7399.134s">So</a>  we're going into winter now. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7401.136s">So</a>  it'll be a little bit more hectic, but getting the sand and all the snow equipment ready.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7405.772s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7406.853s">When</a>  you say waiting for applicants, you got some open positions or I have two open positions right now.</p>

    <p>[Mike Wentzell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7411.838s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7412.359s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7412.699s">So,</a>  but unfortunately it's, uh, I'm not getting any applicants. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7420.119s">And</a>  it's kind of on the top of my radar.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7422.621s">Yeah,</a>  it's on the top of my radar, you know, and been in discussions with my boss's chief of staff and trying to figure out what to do and situation so backup plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7432.446s">We're</a>  in a tough spot just because of the market for jobs with mechanics. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7436.269s">So</a>  folks, you know, want to be a mechanic. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7439.15s">in</a>  Medford Public Works, here's my plea, please come and apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7443.891s">So</a>  anyway, it's a great place to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7445.772s">We</a>  need mechanics, we are starting a program with the Vogue to get some young mechanics in there, but that's tough when we don't even have enough mentors to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7455.374s">And</a>  we're running around trying to service all these vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7459.815s">So</a>  it's a tough spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7462.496s">But</a>  we'll pull through and we're coming up with every idea we can come up with. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7466.662s">When</a>  you say the market, you mean the compensation.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7469.728s">Say</a>  again? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7470.468s">When</a>  you say the market, you mean the compensation or? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7472.849s">That's</a>  part of it.</p>

    <p>[Mike Wentzell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7473.85s">That's</a>  part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7474.61s">But</a>  the other part of it is, is everybody's looking for mechanics. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7478.912s">So</a>  everybody's, I mean, I spoke to a friend of mine that is, is the shop manager for a dealership. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7486.636s">I</a>  asked him, when are you paying the guys? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7487.856s">And</a>  he said, whatever they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7489.777s">So,</a>  I mean, it's just everybody, the entire industry is struggling for mechanics.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7494.999s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Mike Wentzell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7495.42s">So,</a>  okay.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7496.767s">But</a>  it's a good, solid job, and I encourage folks who are interested to reach out. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7501.752s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7502.753s">If</a>  nothing else, to help out Mike here.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7506.696s">Absolutely.</a> </p>

    <p>[Mike Wentzell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7507.737s">Yes,</a>  yes, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7509.018s">My</a>  guy's keeping us afloat, and I really appreciate how hard they work.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7513.322s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7514.083s">We</a>  really appreciate your team, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7515.284s">I</a>  just wanted to... <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7517.057s">I</a>  can sense that you're working a little harder than you, you know, maybe a little overwork.</p>

    <p>[Todd Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7521.26s">Yeah,</a>  I can see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7523.682s">It</a>  also adds to the cost of, you know, these guys are able to handle things in house. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7528.425s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7528.845s">No,</a>  and I know things and it's adding to cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7530.867s">I</a>  have to send them out to other places now.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7532.888s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7535.79s">I</a>  can't see all your fingernails from here, but I think I'm allowed to go into other departments and get mechanics. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7540.834s">So</a>  any takers?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7547.51s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Barry Clemente]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7548.35s">Mike</a>  and his team do a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7549.791s">They</a>  keep the fire alive and they keep us alive too.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7552.293s">I</a>  know.</p>

    <p>[Barry Clemente]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7552.533s">And</a>  it's a daily thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7554.074s">They've</a>  been amazing.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7555.314s">I</a>  know how hard they work and, you know, Mike's usually, usually level-headed, but I could tell tonight he's been maybe a little overworked. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7565.12s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7565.561s">Thanks</a>  you guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7566.762s">We're</a>  going to go to facilities and then we'll come to Owen for water sewer. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7570.844s">Do</a>  we have Paul Riggi on Zoom for the facilities items? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7579.777s">I</a>  see him, I just asked him to unmute. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7581.758s">Hey,</a>  Paul, how you doing?</p>

    <p>[Paul Righi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7583.519s">I'm</a>  good, how are you, President Bears?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7586.32s">Good,</a>  I'll read the items. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7588.561s">I'll</a>  read the items real quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7589.601s">We</a>  had 340,000 for ADA compliant renovations for two bathrooms on the first floor of City Hall, 79,200 for design work at the Hegner Center, 32,000 for fire department paving projects, and 30,000 for the replacement of the hot water heater at the police station.</p>

    <p>[Paul Righi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7606.27s">That</a>  is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7608.994s">Well,</a>  as all the councillors are aware, City Hall does not have any fully ADA compliant bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7618.005s">So</a>  this is to bring the men's and women's room on the first floor, which are currently the <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7625.474s">indicated</a>  as the staff only bathrooms up to be fully ADA compliant. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7631.976s">My</a>  plan is that over the next several years we can renovate every bathroom at City Hall and by doing that we can make every bathroom fully ADA compliant. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7646.381s">But</a>  we really do need ADA compliant bathrooms at City Hall and this project would complete that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7655.809s">The</a>  paving at the fire stations has been something in law long coming engine for driveway on the side of the building to the back of the building where most of the firefighters park has been in disrepair for several years, so I'm. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7674.442s">working</a>  with the DPW to use their vendor to pave that area so it's not a hazard for our firefighters. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7684.725s">The</a>  other part of that piece is at headquarters. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7688.566s">There</a>  is a side parking area that was never paved <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7694.108s">This</a>  causes damage to the fire vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7697.534s">So</a>  by paving this, we can have a safe place for fire vehicles to be able to park and to end the damage to those vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7707.454s">The</a>  Heckner Center will be used as the city's resiliency center. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7712.557s">We</a>  have a grant for that, but the grant did not include funding for the architectural development of that site. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7724.023s">I've</a>  been working with the Board of Health and <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7728.965s">Department</a>  of Recreation to come up with a concept. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7732.907s">Our</a>  architects team has that, and this is the cost to put those designs to paper for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7743.713s">The</a>  police station, unfortunately, the hot water system for the showers in the men's and locker rooms has basically not worked since the building opened. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7756.952s">There</a>  was work done during year one to get that system back up and running. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7763.733s">It</a>  did, but sporadically. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7766.094s">And</a>  since I've been here, the system probably has been down more than it's up. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7772.255s">This</a>  would replace the system with a much more sensical system that would provide hot water in the showers for the police officers when they need it.</p>

    <p>[Marie Izzo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7789.777s">I</a>  think I hit everything, did I?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7792.719s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7793.7s">Thank</a>  you, Paul. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7794.701s">Do</a>  we have any questions on that from members of the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7796.963s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7802.748s">Seeing</a>  none, the only other item in the general capital stabilization fund was $16,500 for updates to the capital improvement plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7809.953s">The</a>  chief of staff did tell me she wasn't going to be able to be here tonight to talk about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7820.712s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7822.133s">So</a>  we'll go to the Water Sewer Capital Stabilization. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7824.974s">We</a>  have City Engineer Wartella here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7827.675s">We</a>  have $175,000 for additional costs relating to a sewer line rehab project and $60,000 for a sewer survey project related to inflow and infiltration. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7837.48s">Owen,</a>  what's up with this?</p>

    <p>[Owen Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7839.502s">We</a>  have been actively doing large sewer projects this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7844.546s">We</a>  found some contaminated soils. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7846.628s">We</a>  need to take care of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7847.689s">So</a>  there are some overages there. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7849.711s">And</a>  there are some other overages with we're doing extra lining and stuff like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7857.783s">And</a>  then the $60,000 for the sewer survey is trying to keep up with all the new development that is occurring in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7868.772s">This</a>  sewer survey will get us ahead so that these developers can do I&I that's required for their projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7878.3s">So</a>  instead of us doing that work, the developers are doing this work for us as required part of their development. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7886.587s">And</a>  so they'll be doing probably close to a half a million gallons of mitigation in sewer inflow over the next couple of years, which the first step is to have a sewer survey.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7901.211s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7901.431s">Do</a>  we have any questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7903.732s">Councilor</a>  Callahan?</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7906.444s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7907.365s">I</a>  would just love a super quick update on our, you know, 300 million year old sewer and water lines, if you can give in a minute or less.</p>

    <p>[Owen Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7920.372s">This</a>  city's sewer and water is probably one of the oldest in the state, other than Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7926.315s">It</a>  is extremely old. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7928.176s">It's</a>  over 100 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7929.877s">It</a>  was made with brick and clay and cast iron, and it's <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7935.461s">Because</a>  of its age, it's deteriorating pretty quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7939.142s">It's</a>  definitely well past its end of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7942.104s">And</a>  we are trying to make sure that we stay ahead of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7947.347s">And</a>  we've upped our sewer maintenance programs for the past couple years. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7954.59s">We've</a>  been doing a lot more. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7956.171s">And</a>  this project that we just finished, <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7959.633s">Sewer</a>  lining project basically lines the pipe and keeps the sewer in and the groundwater out.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7968.645s">Just</a>  a little bit of <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7972.631s">Like,</a>  where are we on our ability to be able to make all these repairs? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7977.052s">Like,</a>  we're still in the planning phase, right, of how we're going to make all these repairs?</p>

    <p>[Owen Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7981.533s">No,</a>  we've got plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7982.773s">Basically,</a>  we've gotten some studies where we have many sewer areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7988.894s">And</a>  those areas we're targeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7990.854s">And</a>  we've gone pretty much about halfway through that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7993.235s">But</a>  with the sewer survey, we're trying to let the developers do a lot of this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7999.156s">uh,</a>  so that we can focus on other like water is basically lead lines is what we're focusing on right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8005.103s">Okay,</a>  thanks. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8005.824s">But</a>  I'm trying to do both at once. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8007.586s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8010.009s">Yeah,</a>  I think just the where Councilor Callahan is getting is we have tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars to work on the water and sewer system. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8017.178s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8017.598s">You</a>  know, there's big backlog.</p>

    <p>[Owen Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8019.793s">There</a>  is a large backlog. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8022.234s">We</a>  are still actively trying to tackle it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8026.376s">If</a>  you wanna add anything to this?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8028.758s">I</a>  know it's an oversimplification, but let's say when you started making the plans to fix it, the backlog was 100%. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8034.38s">Have</a>  we made it 10% of the way through it yet? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8038.783s">No,</a>  no.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8042.368s">Okay,</a>  I'm 1%. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8044.59s">I</a>  would say, maybe take one step back and look at it just a little bit differently. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8049.474s">I</a>  think we're at these things are so long term, we're really still in the planning phase, really, and what that has to do is the rate that we are all paying for water. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8060.203s">Because</a>  it's my opinion, I don't have really the math to back this up, but I think we could do the math and it would back it up, that we've been underrating ourselves for many decades when we should have been paying into our system, investing into our system. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8075.556s">I</a>  don't think we've been doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8076.557s">And</a>  we're not alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8077.577s">So</a>  we've been just letting it rot away and getting by with paying the minimum. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8081.221s">But</a>  now, you know, now it's turning back on us because the leak rate is going up, the break rate is going up, the water quality rate is going down, and the population is going up. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8092.707s">So</a>  we're just kind of at that point where we need to look at the rates and say, okay, are we gonna get, you know, $3 million bigger this year or $4 million bigger this year? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8103.593s">So</a>  we've done that work, you know, and that's where <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8107.055s">The</a>  rates came from last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8108.376s">It's</a>  where they're going to come from next year after that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8111.437s">And</a>  it ties directly into our capital plan that Owen works on. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8116.22s">And</a>  that basically is a reflection of both that rate work and the physicality of the system, the rates, the pressures and the breaks, the water quality attributes, all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8130.982s">So</a>  you merge those two together, and you're in a situation where last year we didn't make a dent, but we're planning to make bigger dense and bigger dance as the years go by, and that's the pace we should really be at, because when we talk about it's failing it's deteriorating. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8145.556s">Sure,</a>  we're getting like. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8147.839s">a</a>  handful more of massive breaks per year. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8151.141s">But</a>  we're talking on the scale of decades here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8153.102s">So</a>  that's why it's hard to even report out what percentage dent we're making in the work that we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8162.208s">Hopefully</a>  that makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8163.289s">We</a>  could keep throwing money at it all day and all year and still not be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8166.651s">But</a>  if we do little increments at a time, by 2030, we'll be on the path to success.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8173.93s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8174.35s">And</a>  to Owen's point, so you're making one point, Tim, which is that the rates were too low for too long. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8180.472s">It's</a>  basically paying the minimum on your credit card. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8182.393s">You're</a>  not actually addressing the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8184.614s">And</a>  it's built up over time.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8186.194s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8187.155s">But</a>  Owen also made the point that one of the main ways that we're trying to address it right now is like when new development comes in, getting them to make significant investments. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8194.797s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8195.598s">So,</a>  you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8197.098s">There's</a>  essentially two things we increase in the water rates, or, you know, when we're trying to bring this new growth and that's a main way that we're addressing this problem as well.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8207.492s">I</a>  guess so. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8208.652s">But</a>  his point is in the realm of that's work that we already have to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8212.174s">We're</a>  already obligated to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8213.374s">We've</a>  been working on it for decades, the II work. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8215.915s">And</a>  then these projects means that we're going to meet those goals quicker. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8220.877s">But</a>  that's not really going to affect the backlog of infrastructure work that we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8225.698s">That's</a>  a different category, I guess is a good way to put it.</p>

    <p>[Owen Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8231.135s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8232.736s">We</a>  still have old pipes, so we're still going to have to take care of the old infrastructure, but we have other means where we can have developers do it as well.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8244.343s">So</a>  you're saying that, for example, when we see a large project, we're making the developers replace the infrastructure?</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8250.812s">To</a>  what we can, and this particular rule says that if you add over 15,000 gallons of water to the system per day, then you have to give four times that of mitigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8263.623s">So</a>  you seal that many leaks to make up four times 15,000 gallons. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8269.688s">So</a>  you're at 60. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8272.185s">That's</a>  a lot of leak patching. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8273.566s">And</a>  that's what he's talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8274.968s">But</a>  we have to do that anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8276.349s">That's</a>  work that we're already doing and already obligated to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8278.892s">It</a>  doesn't really make a dent on the backlog of work.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8280.954s">But</a>  point being that if there were no new developments, then the ratepayers are paying for it entirely because we have to do it anyway.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8287.091s">Entirely,</a>  yes.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8288.372s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Owen Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8288.512s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8289.693s">So</a>  over the, I'm thinking of like the top four large projects have about 600,000 gallons worth of mitigation they need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8299.3s">That's</a>  a lot, a lot, a lot.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8302.182s">And</a>  that will help improve our sewer rate because we pay for that water. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8305.424s">It</a>  gets metered and we pay for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8307.826s">So</a>  if we reduce that number, then that's good for everybody.</p>

    <p>[Jason Stone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8311.169s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8312.71s">Thanks,</a>  you guys.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8314.451s">Any</a>  further questions on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8318.231s">Do</a>  we have a motion on the appropriation paper on the motion approved by Council, let me second by second by Councilman Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8326.734s">All</a>  those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8328.315s">Sorry</a>  actually, Mr. Clerk please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8331.977s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8332.537s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8342.495s">I</a>  just had a question about the capital improvement plan update. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8345.096s">Do</a>  we know?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8345.656s">We</a>  do not have, sorry, go ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8347.696s">There's</a>  no one here to talk about it.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8348.796s">There's</a>  no one here to talk about it, but still, do we know if that's like paying a consultant? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8352.577s">Is</a>  that like, what is, we don't know what that's for?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8355.998s">I'm</a>  not sure what it's for. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8358.298s">Last</a>  time they did the capital improvement plan, it was Collins Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8361.239s">So</a>  I would guess it's probably Collins Center to update it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8363.939s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8365.14s">But</a>  I didn't get that information.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9140.817s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears that says a lot of what I was going to say, just for history state for clarity. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9147.982s">This</a>  is on the agenda because it was tabled to the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9152.725s">The</a>  last time I was on the agenda, and the circumstances surrounding the zoning project are largely the same, the zoning consultant the contract with the zoning consultant ended at the end of the previous fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9162.831s">We</a>  don't have a new one. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9164.832s">In</a>  addition, I understand the CDB is working to fill a lot of spaces on the CDB right now so that they can resume meeting hold holding their public meetings and working through their queue of proposals which includes zoning and other things besides. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9179.738s">I</a>  am eagerly awaiting an update from the mayor's office on when we can expect to see a renewed contract with the zoning consultant so that we can <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9187.461s">not</a>  only continue our zoning review which many Medford residents have invested hours and hours and hours of time into not to mention a lot of money over many years has gone into this, but that we can actually expand it more resources more communication more information and more opportunities for people to participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9205.759s">So,</a>  with my motion to table, I hope that we can take it off the table within the next month or two.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9293.518s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9294.699s">I</a>  think the text kind of says it all I learned about this bill and because it has been endorsed by the AFL CIO, and there's significant union organizing going on in support of it this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9309.269s">Just</a>  to be perfectly clear, though, I think it's pretty clear from the text of the resolution itself, my advocacy for this bill and I think that our collective advocacy for this bill, it is not about advocating for AI in the workplace, it is meant to shore up protections and backstops for workers, including workers in our community, people who live here, people who just come here to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9330.412s">in</a>  a scenario where AI proliferating in the workplace that's already happening and it would be naive to think it's not going to continue to happen more in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9341.84s">If</a>  workers are going to be forced to deal with AI and indeed to see AI take over more of their daily life at work, I think we should at least be advocating that it be mandatory that humans are not taken out of those workflows entirely. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9359.779s">In</a>  addition, there are already many documented harms to people in many contexts, including a work context, for the type of surveillance that AI technologies can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9376.665s">I</a>  think that threatens the role of the worker in the workplace. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9378.646s">I</a>  also think that's like a very, very real documented, clear and present threat to people and workers from a civil liberties and just basic safety standpoint. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9389.069s">So</a>  this is, I think, just a really common sense piece of Massachusetts legislation that is aimed just at protecting the existing role of workers at their jobs and making sure that new technologies, when they're introduced, <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9400.992s">they</a>  augment the worker, they don't replace the worker, they don't make the worker any less safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9405.994s">So</a>  I hope that my fellow councillors will join with me in sending a clear signal to our state delegation that their constituents want to see them standing up for a scenario in which AI maybe complements our lives and does not threaten them. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9424.759s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9425.799s">Motion</a>  for approval.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9429.916s">I'd</a>  like to thank my colleague for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9432.997s">So</a>  I'm a, I'm an AI researcher. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9435.538s">I</a>  agree with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9436.919s">I</a>  mean, AI is one of those, uh, it's kind of a weird area where it will have, and is currently having a lot of, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9446.573s">good</a>  potential effects, also a lot of harms within the economy. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9451.757s">It's</a>  a very powerful new, I'd say, range of technologies. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9458.262s">But</a>  essentially what happens with the private sector is that somebody jumps on an LLM, which is a very generally useful tool, and then they try to sort of exploit it to see how they could <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9473.896s">cut</a>  workers out or save on human resources and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9479.249s">Usually</a>  the effect of doing that just ends up being <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9483.924s">not</a>  really that great. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9485.045s">I</a>  think that one thing that the unions that are endorsing the FAIR Act are saying, for instance, is AI is having a hugely detrimental effect just in hiring these days, where you basically will have AI algorithms that are trying to look at and automatically parse through resumes. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9509.437s">And</a>  then you also have <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9511.975s">people</a>  that sort of know how to leverage this technology, submitting their resumes, using some form of automation to as many companies as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9519.821s">And</a>  essentially what happens is workers just, instead of making an honest resume that <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9530.89s">shows</a>  their experiences. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9532.01s">They</a>  just learn how to sort of like phrase things correctly or write their resume in such a way that it'll be picked up by a certain LLM. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9540.713s">And</a>  when you have people that are submitting thousands upon thousands of resumes to thousands upon thousands of job openings, automatically it becomes impossible for HR people to actually look through them all one by one. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9552.196s">And</a>  so the whole hiring market already has been <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9556.812s">really</a>  damaged by AI in some sectors. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9560.958s">So</a>  that's just one instance of where it's being massively misused. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9569.951s">And</a>  then some other employers also like to put out <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9573.115s">ghost</a>  listings, where they just try to collect as many resumes as possible to train their own AI modules without actually ever hiring anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9580.979s">So</a>  that's another trend that companies are doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9584.14s">And</a>  it's having a very strange effect on the economy. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9587.942s">So</a>  just to give folks a little bit more context into some of the thinking behind this act, but once again, I'm a <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9595.857s">glad</a>  that folks are my colleague is bringing it forward and bring some attention to this bill, and I support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9603.082s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9604.983s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor say, I'll be really brief because I think Council let me get give a really <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9612.482s">good</a>  and thorough explanation of why this bill is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9618.403s">But</a>  I just wanted to say, in talking to union leaders across the state, they had one message, and I thought that they put it really well. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9627.845s">AI</a>  can be a useful tool, but it shouldn't be a replacement. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9631.185s">And</a>  when it comes to things that are so important to the worker, so important to people's rights, and so important to general functioning of society, <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9643.059s">We</a>  need to be careful about how we use these technologies. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9646.001s">Not</a>  that not to say that we should know should be completely closed off, but we need to be cautious with how we approach these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9654.027s">And</a>  so I'm grateful for Vice President Collins for introducing this resolution so we can show our support for this really important bill that will affect Medford workers as well.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9891.39s">Seeing</a>  no further comments, no further hands on Zoom, on the motion, all those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9897.996s">motion</a>  passes 25 1, 3, 6, offer by Councilor Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9902.923s">Whereas</a>  Medford's current inclusionary zoning as defined under chapter 94 section 94.8.1.6 states that at least a certain percent of new units have to be affordable as defined under Mass General Law and are tiered as follows. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9914.638s">10</a>  to 24 lots or units, 10% affordable units, 25 to 49 lots or units, 13% affordable units, 50 or more lots or units, 15% affordable units, and whereas Medford's current policy under 94.18 dictates that if the percentage were not a whole number, it needs to be rounded up, and whereas this creates huge incentives to build the discrete intervals, for instance, strongly incentivizing nine-unit properties but not 10, <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9938.383s">or</a>  strongly incentivizing 20-unit properties but not 21, and whereas other communities such as Watertown and Somerville have incentive plans that allow for fractional payments to the Affordable Housing Trust in lieu of affordable units. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9949.433s">Now,</a>  therefore, be it resolved that the City of Benford update its incentive structures to allow fractional payments. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9954.177s">Be</a>  it further resolved that this paper be referred to the Affordable Housing Trust Fund Board for specific recommendations on how to update the above-referenced policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9961.523s">Be</a>  it further resolved that this paper be referred to the Administration and Finance Committee for further discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9965.166s">Councilor</a>  Leming.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9968.498s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9968.918s">I</a>  think that the text of this resolution really speaks for itself, but this is something that the planning department has long recognized is, and I'd say a flaw in Medford's current <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9985.353s">zoning</a>  codes and it's one that they think could be addressed sort of in a vacuum without needing to without it substantially affecting a whole lot of other parts of the code and I think it would also be a good it would also be good to get the affordable housing trust to offer feedback for <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10011.458s">to</a>  the city council if we are to update our fractional incentive policies so that they so that it could be a mechanism to actually fund the affordable housing trust but essentially essentially what this does is if you look at medford's current very simple inclusionary zoning that's it as it says in the text of the resolution they sort of have <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10037.536s">they</a>  have a policy where developers from a bird's eye view to simplify it, developers can build up to nine units market rate, but then the 10th unit has to be an affordable one. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10056.605s">There's</a>  that like that 10th is a 10%. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10058.947s">And</a>  what this does is it means that Medford has a lot of nine unit properties because suddenly adding on the 10th one would just be a massive <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10066.791s">Josh</a>  Triplett And so basically this and so essentially what this would do is it is instead of having these sort of discrete. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10082.06s">intervals</a>  where suddenly between nine and 10, you suddenly get this jump from 0% affordable to 10% affordable, and then this sudden jump at the 24 to 25 number, it would <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10103.28s">sort</a>  of have it would you could actually change the policy so that you could make it so that instead of having these intervals you could actually like have the developer pay for part of an affordable unit in lieu of actually making in lieu of actually <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10119.38s">building</a>  a unit that is required to be affordable as it's defined under the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10125.182s">So</a>  this would basically make it so that Medford doesn't have like so many 24 or so many nine unit properties and developers wouldn't have that weird discretized incentive and also be another mechanism to fund the Affordable Housing Trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10141.726s">But</a>  I figured that it would be best left up to the policy wonks that are sitting on the AHT. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10149.528s">in</a>  order to recommend the specifics of what this policy is because that can vary from town to town. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10155.789s">So</a>  the recommendation for this is to send out a request to the AHT asking them to develop a recommendation for how to change this policy that could then be considered in the administration and finance committee where I would also motion to refer this paper to. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10180.657s">Councilor</a>  Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10182.898s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10183.118s">It's</a>  a tiny discrepancy. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10184.099s">I</a>  wanted to make sure, um, in this third, whereas you say strongly incentivizing 20 unit properties, but not 21, I assume you mean 24 unit and not 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10194.985s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10198.466s">Um,</a>  if you want to go over it again, Councilor Leming, but I think this should go to planning and permitting, not to administration and finance, but go ahead.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10209.497s">Yeah,</a>  my logic for that was that planning and permitting seemed to be pretty busy. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10216.519s">But</a>  no, I'd accept that, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10218.879s">Got</a>  some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10220.1s">Got</a>  some time available. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10224.661s">Yeah,</a>  so motion to, I'll go ahead and amend it in motion to refer to the planning and permitting committee instead.</p>

    <p>[Micah Kesselman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10602.349s">I</a>  was going on zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10604.071s">It's</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10609.515s">Michael</a>  Kasselman, 499 Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10611.196s">So</a>  the reason I came here tonight is I, something's brought to my attention this morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10614.436s">I</a>  am sure many of you have already heard about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10617.457s">So</a>  the New England Baptist Church, a group that has been a sort of scourge on one of the primary transit ways in our city for a while has come up with this new Fickhock nonsense. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10634.043s">They</a>  have a giant sign that says everything I ever needed to learn about Islam I learned in five minutes on 9-11-2001. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10642.554s">wildly</a>  beyond the pale. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10644.715s">There</a>  not only is this just straight up offensive, I would argue that it is not actually protected speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10651.917s">I</a>  think this tows the line well into incitement. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10656.518s">Regardless,</a>  I don't think that there's anything that you can really do as a council, because that would be an enforcement action on the mayor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10663.62s">And</a>  I don't have expectations of her to do anything about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10666.761s">What</a>  I would like to see though, is I do think that this council can <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10671.817s">look</a>  into putting together a referral packet to send to the IRS to perform an audit of their 501c3 taxes exempt status. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10681.789s">They</a>  are a tax exempt organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10683.932s">However,</a>  they can lose that status for doing things like committing <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10692.067s">using</a>  inciting language or things that, or making public statements that are generally against the public safety and good. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10699.609s">It</a>  is a lot looser than the actual rules for a finding of incitement. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10706.071s">This</a>  is really egregious though. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10707.811s">Like</a>  I can't say how, I can't understand how egregious this is because there is a mosque less than 300 feet down the street <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10720.821s">It's</a>  a Bangladeshi mosque, but I don't think that they understand the differences anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10725.907s">But</a>  anyway, this is crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10728.33s">And</a>  I think a very good rule of thumb is whether or not this is an incitement of violence or begins to get into that line is if you are a measure if you are a mother in a hijab walking <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10741.092s">your</a>  child to the mosque and you walk by this sign, would this put you in a reasonable apprehension of fear for your personal safety and the safety of your child? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10751.575s">I</a>  think it very much would. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10754.076s">This</a>  is ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10756.817s">And</a>  there needs to be something done about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10758.578s">Like</a>  I said, you can't force them to take it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10762.599s">I</a>  recognize that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10765.3s">But</a>  I do think that going after the tax exempt status is <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10769.067s">something</a>  absolutely worth doing by this council and something that can be done by this council relatively easily too. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10780.065s">So</a>  that's my public comment.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10785.936s">You</a>  aced it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10787.597s">And</a>  I just want to say that, yeah, I think the messaging is horrific. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10790.658s">It's</a>  certainly not the first instance of awful, hateful speech that we've seen on that message board. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10795.981s">And</a>  residents have persistently stood up to say that it doesn't represent our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10800.884s">But</a>  I understand your position. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10803.285s">And</a>  I'm going to go quickly to Councilor Leming and then Vice President Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10807.147s">Councilor</a>  Leming.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10809.208s">Just</a>  a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10809.689s">If</a>  you <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10814.522s">Do</a>  you know of any other precedent or specific instances of churches having their 513C status revoked for stuff like this? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10826.967s">I</a>  remember the Westboro Baptist Church was in the news for a couple of years for doing stuff like this, but I never really looked into whether they got in trouble with the IRS.</p>

    <p>[Micah Kesselman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10837.93s">I</a>  so I did not preface this statement with I am a lawyer, because this is way outside of my practice area. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10843.893s">I</a>  don't do most of that or tax law. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10846.654s">So</a>  I don't have any sort of idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10850.215s">I</a>  mean, I certainly know that organizations for people speech have been have lost their taxes and status like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10858.379s">It's,</a>  you know, speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10860.92s">incitement,</a>  specifically incitement, but also just generally stuff that like is in the vicinity of incitement is given as an example by the IRS itself as reasons to actually drop a tax exempt status for an organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10875.306s">So</a>  clearly it's happened before, because it's used as like a specific example. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10880.448s">But</a>  yeah, as far as like the case law around it, like that's not something that I know a lot about. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10886.391s">But</a>  I will say that at the end of the day, <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10889.792s">There's</a>  a difference between a group of random arbitrary concerned residents putting together a referral, because anyone can refer anyone to the IRS for an audit. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10904.247s">Arguably,</a>  I could go do it myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10906.79s">But</a>  having it come from a municipality does give it additional weight. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10912.075s">And</a>  then the IRS makes the ultimate determination. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10914.217s">So</a>  it's not something that like, they're not like spending lawyers on or anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10918.441s">They're</a>  spending money on lawyers or anything.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10921.458s">I</a>  don't, I don't, I don't know why, why they do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10923.799s">I</a>  mean, they have prime real estate and they put up out a number of inflammatory messages. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10929.402s">They</a>  went to the pride fest, like the Medford's some, some Medford pride events and literally had a fellow out there with a megaphone shouting things across the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10945.857s">It's</a>  sad. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10946.358s">There's</a>  like a, when I went to college, there's this guy, I remember UNC Chapel Hill, he was called a pit preacher, and he just, this guy just used to come in the middle of campus and just say the most <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10963.114s">horrific</a>  things to college students. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10965.135s">And</a>  it was just something that he just did all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10967.875s">He</a>  would quote the Bible while he was doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10971.516s">I</a>  think he did it to get people's attention, to get a rise out of them, to try to, you know, get attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10978.677s">I</a>  don't know if that's the strategy, if that's what this church is going for. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10986.959s">I</a>  think it is not a <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10993.258s">It's</a>  something that makes residents feel scared, and I wish they would stop doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10997.039s">But</a>  this does fall under. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10998.48s">But</a>  yeah, that's all I'll say. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=11003.282s">It</a>  doesn't make me happy.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=11007.443s">Sorry,</a>  Micah. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=11007.863s">I'm</a>  going to go to Vice President Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=11009.224s">Vice</a>  President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=11011.957s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=11012.377s">Just</a>  really quickly, I just wanted to say thank you for raising this like to the community and also to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=11017.219s">I</a>  think it's true, even if this church has completely lost credibility with everybody who isn't a congregant, it is still important for the community and the city to loudly step up and say, wow, like, no, absolutely not. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=11031.026s">They've</a>  been pulling this stuff for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=11032.826s">This</a>  is probably the worst example of hate speech that I've seen from them or anywhere in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=11039.349s">But</a>  still, I think that we should <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=11041.01s">do</a>  we can do what we can to condemn it because we should just, we should just always do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=11045.194s">So</a>  thank you again for putting this on our radar and be happy to work with you further to put something on a future city council agenda.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=11051.96s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=11057.065s">We're</a>  just gonna we're gonna take it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=11058.226s">I'm</a>  sorry, Micah. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=11059.707s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=11060.147s">I</a>  got to respect the rules of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=11062.449s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=11064.031s">Thank</a>  you for bringing that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=11065.112s">I</a>  think we're going to hear more about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=11067.045s">I</a>  am also hopeful that we will see some of the surrounding businesses and residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=11072.707s">You</a>  know, we saw the last time a few months ago when they had a sign, Modern Pastry, put up a sign right next to it, directly opposing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=11079.629s">That</a>  is another way to use speech to counteract speech like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=11085.671s">So</a>  there's a lot of different approaches that we could take. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=11088.472s">Is</a>  there a motion on the floor? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=11089.352s">Is</a>  there anyone else like to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=11090.932s">Public</a>  participation either in person or on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=11095.799s">All</a>  right, seeing none, is there a motion on the floor? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=11099.181s">On</a>  the motion adjourned by Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=11105.105s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=11106.586s">Opposed?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=11107.266s">Motion</a>  passes and the meeting is adjourned.</p>
