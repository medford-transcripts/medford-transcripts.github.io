25137 announcements, accolades, remembrances, reports, and records.

20
00:09:15,461 --> 00:09:18,205
25137 offered by Councilor Lazaro and President Behrs.

21
00:09:19,127 --> 00:09:22,972
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council acknowledge and celebrate National Recovery Month.

22
00:09:23,493 --> 00:09:24,675
Councilor Lazaro.

23
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:26,760
Thank you.

24
00:09:27,941 --> 00:09:33,523
Thank you for the opportunity to recognize National Recovery Month, September's National Recovery Month.

25
00:09:34,043 --> 00:09:45,927
August 31 was International Overdose Awareness Day and we were able to, I was able to attend a vigil here at City Hall in remembrance of

26
00:09:47,256 --> 00:09:51,538
people whose lives were lost in overdoses.

27
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:54,079
And it was a really sad, but really touching event.

28
00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:01,382
We lost 14 lives in Medford due to opioid use disorder this year.

29
00:10:01,402 --> 00:10:12,367
The event had purple flags placed outside to remember the people who have passed away from overdoses in the past 10 years.

30
00:10:13,427 --> 00:10:23,176
And this month is, rather than a memorial, it's a celebration of recovery, and it reminds people that recovery is possible.

31
00:10:23,636 --> 00:10:34,385
So I thought this would be a good opportunity to actually introduce a couple of our city employees whose roles in the city are to help connect residents to recovery resources.

32
00:10:35,146 --> 00:10:40,430
The first is, and I'd like to bring them up as I introduce them, Chris Suma.

33
00:10:41,151 --> 00:10:45,426
is our recovery coach in Medford and Chris's role is to

34
00:10:47,591 --> 00:10:49,833
help guide residents through recovery.

35
00:10:51,374 --> 00:10:56,197
And the other is Jason Stone, who is our social worker in the city.

36
00:10:56,937 --> 00:11:00,100
Sorry, I wrote down Jason's job title, but I've lost it in my notes.

37
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,120
He can tell you.

38
00:11:02,121 --> 00:11:08,205
Jason also connects people to resources, all the social services resources that we have access to here.

39
00:11:08,665 --> 00:11:15,190
So I'd love to give you two an opportunity to talk about what recovery resources residents can access in City Hall.

40
00:11:17,997 --> 00:11:21,861
So yes, Jason stone social services coordinator here at City Hall.

41
00:11:22,301 --> 00:11:34,572
In terms of the resources that are available, I think the easiest way for folks to access anything is to really just reach out and call Chris and I, Chris is here with us two days a week but as he will no doubt tell you his phone is always on.

42
00:11:35,573 --> 00:11:36,414
I'm here every day.

43
00:11:37,935 --> 00:11:47,243
A lot of my work here isn't necessarily substance use related, but prior to coming to work for municipal government, I spent 20 years working in the substance use disorder treatment field.

44
00:11:47,563 --> 00:11:49,365
So that's always been sort of my passion.

45
00:11:50,346 --> 00:11:52,327
We try to do a lot for families.

46
00:11:52,387 --> 00:11:56,511
We get a lot of phone calls from families, reaching out, looking for help for loved ones.

47
00:11:57,031 --> 00:12:01,295
And between Chris and I, we have contacts most everywhere across the Commonwealth.

48
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:08,038
at outpatient facilities, intensive outpatient, PHP programs, detoxes, sober houses.

49
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:13,601
We also have a recovery group that Chris can tell you more about.

50
00:12:13,661 --> 00:12:18,244
I should probably just let Chris tell you the rest because this is like, this is his life's work.

51
00:12:20,593 --> 00:12:20,993
How are you doing?

52
00:12:21,033 --> 00:12:23,394
I'm Chris, I am the recovery coach.

53
00:12:24,214 --> 00:12:28,255
So a little about me, I have obviously lived experience, which is why I'm in this role.

54
00:12:29,475 --> 00:12:32,735
My job is when I deal with people, I relate with them, they relate with me.

55
00:12:33,196 --> 00:12:38,917
It makes transitioning into recovery much easier if somebody has done it and can show you the way.

56
00:12:39,737 --> 00:12:45,958
With that being said, we work with different organizations throughout the area, the bridge in Malden, we work very closely with Malden.

57
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:48,919
North Suffolk Community Services, we work very closely with them.

58
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,675
different recovery events and stuff like that.

59
00:12:52,715 --> 00:12:54,757
We're always attending, we're always pushing people to go.

60
00:12:55,678 --> 00:12:57,100
We run a recovery group, I apologize.

61
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,684
We run a recovery group every Wednesday at City Hall from 4.30 to 5.30.

62
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:02,125
Anybody can attend.

63
00:13:02,185 --> 00:13:12,537
We provide a meal and it's just an opportunity to socialize, get involved in recovery and just see that there is a way out.

64
00:13:13,546 --> 00:13:19,869
One of the things that I just want to make clear to everybody is, this is not just for the people that are out there.

65
00:13:20,309 --> 00:13:22,790
This also goes for everybody sitting in this room.

66
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:26,332
If anybody's dealing with any issues, please come and find me and let's talk.

67
00:13:26,552 --> 00:13:28,913
If it's your friends, if it's your family, doesn't matter.

68
00:13:28,973 --> 00:13:30,974
This disease does not discriminate.

69
00:13:31,614 --> 00:13:32,715
And please reach out.

70
00:13:34,255 --> 00:13:37,397
Like I said, I'm here Tuesdays and Wednesdays, but as Jason said,

71
00:13:38,257 --> 00:13:42,940
chances are if you call me on a Sunday at three in the morning, I'm going to answer because you never know when that crisis is going to happen.

72
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,740
And I want to be there.

73
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,541
So thank you for letting me come and share.

74
00:13:45,561 --> 00:13:46,502
I really appreciate it guys.

75
00:13:48,243 --> 00:13:48,803
Thank you guys.

76
00:13:49,403 --> 00:13:50,104
Councilor Zara.

77
00:13:50,984 --> 00:13:52,365
Thank you so much for being here.

78
00:13:52,385 --> 00:14:05,152
I, when I met Chris for the first time at the vigil, we exchanged cards and he texted me that day and his message had many exclamation points.

79
00:14:05,192 --> 00:14:06,413
He's very passionate.

80
00:14:07,734 --> 00:14:08,334
City employees.

81
00:14:08,394 --> 00:14:11,157
So I really appreciate him coming and joining the team.

82
00:14:11,437 --> 00:14:17,242
And I think that's really true that I think if you texted Chris at three in the morning, he would get right back to you.

83
00:14:17,762 --> 00:14:24,908
Another thing I wanted to mention is September 24th, Medford City Hall will be hosting an event, recovery event.

84
00:14:25,068 --> 00:14:26,630
It's 5.30 p.m.

85
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:27,691
until 7 p.m.

86
00:14:27,871 --> 00:14:31,794
It involves speakers from the recovery community, a live music performance,

87
00:14:32,835 --> 00:14:34,656
The mayor will be making a special announcement.

88
00:14:34,696 --> 00:14:44,040
There's going to be a hope and remembrance luminary display and then a post-program community tables, a food truck, DJ and music and wellness activities.

89
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,901
So everybody's invited to that as well.

90
00:14:47,982 --> 00:14:48,342
Thank you.

91
00:14:49,762 --> 00:14:50,743
Vice President Collins.

92
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:53,120
Thank you.

93
00:14:53,401 --> 00:14:59,486
Thank you, Councilor Lazaro for putting this on the agenda and I want to thank you too specifically for the work that you do here in our city.

94
00:15:00,247 --> 00:15:05,832
I love the idea of not just recognizing but celebrating National Recovery Month, obviously recovery is

95
00:15:07,338 --> 00:15:09,940
incredibly difficult, incredibly challenging.

96
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:20,188
Every experience is different for everybody, but I have so much respect to those who commit to going through it and those who commit to helping others up that ladder as well.

97
00:15:20,268 --> 00:15:25,893
So it's not a thing to take lightly, but it is a thing to take joy in and to really say to all of our

98
00:15:26,473 --> 00:15:33,076
many, many friends and families and neighbors who have direct experience or experience of somebody in their community going through that to say, we see you, we celebrate you.

99
00:15:33,837 --> 00:15:36,378
Not to say it's not hard, but it can be joyful too.

100
00:15:36,598 --> 00:15:37,378
So thank you very much.

101
00:15:39,999 --> 00:15:40,380
Thank you.

102
00:15:41,537 --> 00:15:42,758
And I just want to thank you guys.

103
00:15:43,579 --> 00:15:44,440
I completely agree.

104
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:52,309
I think talking about recovery is something to celebrate, something to be proud of, something that the community can join in with and help people with is the way to think about it.

105
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,552
Fights any stigma and brings it around too.

106
00:15:56,574 --> 00:16:00,638
We want our community members to thrive and be healthy and stay here with us.

107
00:16:00,738 --> 00:16:02,340
So I'm really thank you for your work.

00:20:42,306 --> 00:20:44,207
All right, do we have a representative from National Grid?

156
00:20:44,228 --> 00:20:44,608
We do.

157
00:20:47,393 --> 00:20:52,154
If you could describe the project and then we'll ask any questions and then we'll open the public hearing.

158
00:20:52,654 --> 00:20:53,354
Hi, good evening.

159
00:20:53,394 --> 00:20:57,915
My name is Diana Cuddy, National Grid 170 Data Drive, Waltham, Massachusetts.

160
00:20:58,235 --> 00:21:04,776
I'm here tonight to request a rental location for a gas main replacement project on the Boston Avenue Bridge.

161
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:11,537
It's starting around 136, 138 Boston Avenue and extending over the bridge into Somerville where the project continues.

162
00:21:14,538 --> 00:21:14,718
Great.

163
00:21:14,738 --> 00:21:16,398
Do we have any questions from members of the council?

164
00:21:21,372 --> 00:21:23,634
Seeing none, I will declare the public hearing open.

165
00:21:23,654 --> 00:21:31,181
As part of this public hearing, if you could say if you're in favor, in opposition, or otherwise, and members of the public are welcome to speak.

166
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:32,762
I'm in favor of this project.

167
00:21:32,943 --> 00:21:33,203
Great.

168
00:21:35,105 --> 00:21:38,768
Is there anyone either in person or on Zoom who would like to speak regarding this project?

169
00:21:43,372 --> 00:21:44,853
If you're in person, you can come to the podium.

170
00:21:44,873 --> 00:21:46,475
If you're on Zoom, you can raise your hand on Zoom.

171
00:21:54,468 --> 00:21:56,649
Seeing none, I'm declaring the public hearing closed.

172
00:21:56,669 --> 00:21:59,050
Is there a motion?

173
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:02,591
On the motion approved by Councilor Lemming, seconded by?

174
00:22:03,171 --> 00:22:04,252
Seconded by Councilor Callahan.

175
00:22:04,312 --> 00:22:05,672
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

176
00:22:08,273 --> 00:22:09,114
Councilor Callahan.

177
00:22:11,534 --> 00:22:12,495
Vice President Collins.

178
00:22:13,855 --> 00:22:14,596
Councilor Zaro.

179
00:22:15,976 --> 00:22:16,596
Councilor Lemming.

180
00:22:17,937 --> 00:22:18,757
Councilor Scapelli.

181
00:22:20,198 --> 00:22:20,758
Councilor Tsang.

182
00:22:22,086 --> 00:22:22,647
President Behrs.

183
00:22:22,847 --> 00:22:25,209
Yes, I have the affirmative, none the negative, the motion passes.

184
00:22:25,569 --> 00:22:26,210
Thank you very much.

185
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:26,930
Thanks, Diana.

186
00:22:30,634 --> 00:22:30,994
All right.

187
00:22:31,675 --> 00:22:33,716
Petitions, presentations, and similar papers.

188
00:22:33,776 --> 00:22:36,219
Petition for a common vixen license, CB Scoops.

189
00:22:37,259 --> 00:22:39,161
Do we have CB Scoops here present?

190
00:22:39,281 --> 00:22:39,521
Great.

191
00:22:40,612 --> 00:22:44,194
If you could tell us a little bit about your application, and then we'll turn it over to Councilor Scarpelli.

192
00:22:44,574 --> 00:22:46,135
Thank you for having me here Council tonight.

193
00:22:46,515 --> 00:22:50,978
My name is Steve Caciola, I'm applying for the Common Vix down at CB Scoots in West Medbridge Square.

194
00:22:51,858 --> 00:22:57,021
Ginny Roach ran it for about 16 years, and she reached out to me like she was looking to retire.

195
00:22:57,041 --> 00:23:01,504
And I don't know if you guys have heard the rumors, but yes, I own Socks Ice Cream.

196
00:23:01,664 --> 00:23:06,687
I bought that in 2016, so she thought I'd be the perfect candidate to continue the legacy.

197
00:23:07,467 --> 00:23:09,148
So I jumped right on it.

198
00:23:09,368 --> 00:23:10,089
She's a great woman.

199
00:23:10,109 --> 00:23:11,249
She had a great thing down there.

200
00:23:11,269 --> 00:23:13,230
And I plan on keeping everything the same.

201
00:23:14,491 --> 00:23:16,412
Everyone's asking if I'm putting socks ice cream in there.

202
00:23:16,432 --> 00:23:18,133
I will be keeping the Richardson's.

203
00:23:18,413 --> 00:23:20,695
Everyone is a little iffy about that.

204
00:23:20,755 --> 00:23:23,396
If anything, I'll get an additional freezer to serve the socks.

205
00:23:24,057 --> 00:23:25,758
But besides that, it'll be the same thing.

206
00:23:25,778 --> 00:23:27,479
It'll be noon to 10 p.m.

207
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:29,600
And then during the winter, it'll be 9 p.m.

208
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:29,840
Yeah.

209
00:23:30,678 --> 00:23:33,259
And yeah, just want to keep the square the same.

210
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:34,319
It's wicked cute down there.

211
00:23:34,339 --> 00:23:35,019
I'm from Saugus.

212
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,200
We have Cliftondale and it's not really the same.

213
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:41,001
Like you guys have like an actual functioning economy there.

214
00:23:41,041 --> 00:23:41,721
You know what I mean?

215
00:23:41,741 --> 00:23:42,542
Yeah, it's so cute.

216
00:23:42,582 --> 00:23:42,962
I love it.

217
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:46,263
The other stores around me have already welcomed me in.

218
00:23:46,323 --> 00:23:52,505
Amici's, New Hong Kong Express, Lucy's across the street, the bookstore and Snappy Patty's.

219
00:23:52,525 --> 00:23:54,105
They all seem like wonderful establishments.

220
00:23:54,825 --> 00:23:56,946
So any questions for me about the ice cream industry?

221
00:24:01,614 --> 00:24:02,535
Thank you, Mr. President.

222
00:24:03,036 --> 00:24:03,816
I see everything's in order.

223
00:24:03,836 --> 00:24:07,159
The only thing I don't see is the special line for city councilors.

224
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,240
Oh, okay.

225
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:08,941
Oh, definitely.

226
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:10,382
That's the back door.

227
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:11,483
Is that against the law?

228
00:24:11,503 --> 00:24:13,305
That's against the law.

229
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:14,866
I see everything in order.

230
00:24:14,906 --> 00:24:16,467
I move forward for approval, Mr. President.

231
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:17,488
All right.

232
00:24:17,608 --> 00:24:18,389
Thank you, Council.

233
00:24:18,669 --> 00:24:19,530
Any other questions?

234
00:24:20,431 --> 00:24:22,353
Councilor Lemke.

235
00:24:22,453 --> 00:24:23,514
What's your favorite flavor?

236
00:24:24,655 --> 00:24:24,995
Mine?

237
00:24:25,195 --> 00:24:26,636
Mocha chip, definitely.

238
00:24:26,797 --> 00:24:28,058
Coffee and chocolate all day.

239
00:24:28,652 --> 00:24:29,872
I don't know if I could support this.

240
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:32,133
No, I'm kidding.

241
00:24:33,134 --> 00:24:33,674
Thank you.

242
00:24:35,134 --> 00:24:35,334
Right.

243
00:24:35,534 --> 00:24:40,056
On the motion of Councilor Scarpa to approve seconded by seconded by Vice President Collins.

244
00:24:40,096 --> 00:24:41,056
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

245
00:24:42,937 --> 00:24:43,277
Thank you.

246
00:24:46,078 --> 00:24:54,201
Vice President Collins, Councilor Lazaro, Councilor Lemming, Councilor Scarpa, Councilor Singh.

247
00:24:55,139 --> 00:24:55,859
President Beers.

248
00:24:55,959 --> 00:24:56,199
Yes.

249
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,940
Second the affirmative, then the negative.

250
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,800
The motion passes.

251
00:25:00,181 --> 00:25:00,541
Thanks.

252
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:04,622
Good luck.

253
00:25:04,642 --> 00:25:09,284
2-5-1-3-1, petition for amendment to common victors license, extended hours, Great American Beer Hall.

254
00:25:12,045 --> 00:25:12,805
Do we have a proponent?

255
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:13,945
Yes, we do.

256
00:25:15,066 --> 00:25:17,707
Give me one second to find your paperwork in here.

257
00:25:17,727 --> 00:25:21,388
Yeah.

258
00:25:23,849 --> 00:25:24,569
That I knew.

259
00:25:26,222 --> 00:25:30,205
All right, looks like the request is for 7 a.m.

260
00:25:30,245 --> 00:25:30,865
to 2 a.m.

261
00:25:30,945 --> 00:25:31,646
every day.

262
00:25:31,726 --> 00:25:34,788
Brief explanation, early morning coffee, late night pizza.

263
00:25:35,288 --> 00:25:38,790
And with that, I'll turn it over to you guys to explain what you're looking for.

264
00:25:39,651 --> 00:25:42,392
Brian Zarather, 142 Mystic Ave, Great American Beer Hall.

265
00:25:43,193 --> 00:25:46,075
John Shea, 142 Mystic Ave, Great American Beer Hall.

266
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:55,836
So actually, recently this week, we've come to an agreement with Nassau Donuts to move them from Somerville to the Great American Beer Hall.

267
00:25:55,936 --> 00:25:59,959
So early morning coffee, yeah, donuts, it's gonna be pretty cool.

268
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,641
So that's the 7 a.m.

269
00:26:02,841 --> 00:26:04,783
request, which I couldn't be more excited for.

270
00:26:04,803 --> 00:26:10,887
Gonna start to build out pretty much immediately on the coffee stuff, and so it's gonna be a pretty cool, fun concept.

271
00:26:12,348 --> 00:26:12,789
Late night,

272
00:26:13,883 --> 00:26:17,048
it's we're really losing this crowd to Somerville and Everett.

273
00:26:17,429 --> 00:26:21,976
And so there's the 2am licenses available over there.

274
00:26:21,996 --> 00:26:24,941
And, you know,

275
00:26:26,229 --> 00:26:32,512
We've been open a year and we made 1000 mistakes and we've learned a lot about what works and what doesn't.

276
00:26:33,132 --> 00:26:37,453
And so I know the noise complaints from our neighbors, we've taken very seriously.

277
00:26:38,434 --> 00:26:46,337
We've got rid of the outside DJs, we're now shutting the garage door, doing everything that we can to mitigate that.

278
00:26:49,038 --> 00:27:00,145
Yeah, recently we had something called the sunset session and we sold tickets to it and it was going to have an outdoor DJ and we actually canceled the event and refunded all the tickets that was back in July.

279
00:27:01,065 --> 00:27:06,929
So we're trying to take steps moving forward to make sure we're like more respectful to our neighbors.

280
00:27:07,289 --> 00:27:13,653
We've also hung signs on the door stating like, please be respectful, please park in the parking lot, that kind of stuff.

281
00:27:14,894 --> 00:27:18,616
And now we also close the door at 9pm on the garage and

282
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:22,006
we shut off the outdoor speakers at 9 p.m.

283
00:27:22,327 --> 00:27:24,789
and we just started doing that about a week and a half ago.

284
00:27:27,171 --> 00:27:35,638
Lastly, we're a year in and we've been approached by Nextdoor to do a hotel that we're talking to, apartments across the street.

285
00:27:36,278 --> 00:27:44,305
And all of this really started with the Great American Beer Hall, like opening up on Mystic Ave and we're finally seeing some development opportunities at our abutting properties.

286
00:27:44,365 --> 00:27:46,367
So I know we can't please everyone,

287
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:51,489
But I think the greater good of Medford, this is, this is really important for us.

288
00:27:54,431 --> 00:27:54,711
Thanks.

289
00:27:54,791 --> 00:27:57,834
We'll go to members of the council and then we'll go to public comment.

290
00:27:58,514 --> 00:28:00,756
Councilor Scarpelli, then Councilor Zaro.

291
00:28:02,518 --> 00:28:03,178
Thank you very much.

292
00:28:03,218 --> 00:28:07,182
And first of all, great opportunity, I'm sure.

293
00:28:08,699 --> 00:28:15,382
You're seeing some great events, and I appreciate you taking the opportunity to choose Medford.

294
00:28:16,222 --> 00:28:21,184
But the truth of the matter is, there are a bunch of people behind you that are very, very upset.

295
00:28:21,504 --> 00:28:32,869
And the complaints that I've gotten from the noise, the conversations of moving speakers, eliminating speakers,

296
00:28:33,588 --> 00:28:35,751
It really fell on deaf ears.

297
00:28:35,811 --> 00:28:44,864
It sounds like I mean I have video after video people send me after after night saying they stand on their on their porch and you can hear the music and

298
00:28:45,702 --> 00:28:51,786
You know, I've talked to our team here at Metro City Hall, and they've said that they've reached out to you and you've making some moves.

299
00:28:51,847 --> 00:28:55,950
But to be honest with you, I'm a person that really has to prove it.

300
00:28:56,670 --> 00:29:06,377
And as much as we don't want to see you lose any business to Somerville, I think that for one counselor, I'm a little, little leery to push anything forward when

301
00:29:08,068 --> 00:29:11,612
The hours that you have now are really affecting the quality of life and neighbors.

302
00:29:11,992 --> 00:29:16,257
And I know you said that quite, you just said, quote unquote, can't make everybody happy.

303
00:29:17,157 --> 00:29:18,939
These people you want to make happy, they're your neighbors.

304
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,541
So I think that's very important.

305
00:29:21,021 --> 00:29:22,103
I think it's very important.

306
00:29:22,543 --> 00:29:24,665
So, you know, I'm,

307
00:29:26,336 --> 00:29:32,698
I appreciate you wanted to move forward with the business, but I'm going to be very honest with one counselor until I see the proof.

308
00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:36,659
I can't support this because I have talked to the neighbors.

309
00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:37,299
I've been there.

310
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:38,860
I've seen the videos.

311
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:42,161
I've watched them multiple, multiple times.

312
00:29:42,801 --> 00:29:53,004
And, um, and I think I mean, maybe a year and a year ago I came in, I think I spoke to you and I said something we can do.

313
00:29:53,644 --> 00:29:55,025
And I know you said you were trying, but, um,

314
00:29:57,377 --> 00:29:58,417
we still haven't seen enough.

315
00:29:58,677 --> 00:30:05,159
And to move forward to two o'clock in the morning now, every night, you're asking for every night at two in the morning.

316
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,960
That's something that this council really has to look at.

317
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,401
I understand the entertainment world.

318
00:30:13,121 --> 00:30:14,901
Well, you put in for every night, so I'm reading it.

319
00:30:15,381 --> 00:30:20,403
And I know for the entertainment, we know Thursday, Friday, Saturday is very important.

320
00:30:20,883 --> 00:30:26,324
But when you talk to a resident and they see this and they're like, hold on, they wanna do this on nights that we have to go to work.

321
00:30:27,393 --> 00:30:30,017
And what we have to endure in that neighborhood.

322
00:30:30,697 --> 00:30:43,414
And we have just so you know this I'm just telling you know what people approach me about, you know, and you can be, you can be defensive I understand that because it is your business your livelihood, but I just want you to understand this is what I've been hearing as a city council this is what I've been seeing from what they've sent me.

323
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:48,383
What you're hearing is the quality of life is really been an impact.

324
00:30:48,423 --> 00:30:54,567
And listen, I've talked to residents said, listen, I understand, but there are some nights we have to, it is a business.

325
00:30:54,607 --> 00:30:55,568
It is a business district.

326
00:30:55,668 --> 00:30:56,349
It's zoned that way.

327
00:30:56,409 --> 00:31:01,592
We have to understand that, you know, even, even the situation with the parking, people taking my parking spot in front of my house.

328
00:31:02,073 --> 00:31:03,974
I understand that that's nothing you have control of.

329
00:31:04,014 --> 00:31:07,456
Cause I know if you wanted it, you'd want more parking spots too in your location.

330
00:31:08,017 --> 00:31:08,937
But unfortunately, um,

331
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:11,628
there are some gives and takes.

332
00:31:11,688 --> 00:31:17,553
And for right now, and I know that until the residents behind you come up and say, you know what, it's fine.

333
00:31:18,053 --> 00:31:18,974
We've met with them.

334
00:31:19,114 --> 00:31:19,954
Have you met with the neighbors?

335
00:31:20,035 --> 00:31:21,376
Have you recently met with the neighbors?

336
00:31:22,136 --> 00:31:23,137
I'm available.

337
00:31:23,717 --> 00:31:25,018
So you have, so that's what I'm saying.

338
00:31:25,078 --> 00:31:35,747
So you hear asking for something, but the biggest concerns were that the neighbors that are really affected, I mean, whether they go to sleep at night,

339
00:31:36,345 --> 00:31:38,746
whether they have to put sound machines in the house because of the base.

340
00:31:38,766 --> 00:31:41,347
I mean, these are things that I'm just sharing what they're saying.

341
00:31:41,367 --> 00:31:45,748
So out of full transparency, I have been working with those neighbors.

342
00:31:46,148 --> 00:31:52,811
I've listened to them and out of all due respect until I see something different, I can't support this.

343
00:31:52,831 --> 00:31:53,371
So thank you.

344
00:31:54,131 --> 00:31:54,431
Thank you.

345
00:31:55,532 --> 00:31:55,852
Thank you.

346
00:31:56,112 --> 00:32:01,974
We'll go to some other councilors, but if you want to go first, you guys, if you want to say anything about what you've been doing or answering the councilor's questions.

347
00:32:03,355 --> 00:32:04,075
We can wait to the end.

348
00:32:04,475 --> 00:32:04,655
Okay.

349
00:32:05,792 --> 00:32:08,435
go to Councilor Zara, then Councilor Collins.

350
00:32:09,917 --> 00:32:10,738
Thank you for being here.

351
00:32:10,758 --> 00:32:12,259
I think the 7 a.m.

352
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:13,160
is a no brainer.

353
00:32:13,241 --> 00:32:14,602
That sounds great.

354
00:32:19,751 --> 00:32:24,755
I have gotten a lot of emails about noise disturbances from residents.

355
00:32:24,855 --> 00:32:27,177
I haven't heard anything about the Great American Beer Hall.

356
00:32:27,197 --> 00:32:39,668
It's possible that people sometimes reach out to counselors they already know, but I've gotten noise complaints from folks about Wendy's at Wellington, from folks about the MBTA train station.

357
00:32:39,688 --> 00:32:42,030
I have not heard about the beer hall.

358
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,631
It does not mean that it isn't happening.

359
00:32:44,031 --> 00:32:45,813
But that being said,

360
00:32:49,252 --> 00:33:03,521
If you are responsive to noise complaints, and you're following the, if you're, if you're responsive to what's happening, and if there's follow up, I think that for me, it's

361
00:33:07,446 --> 00:33:17,198
reasonable for a large establishment to stay open late as long as people are still attending an event or they're still there.

362
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:24,907
I think Medford has a history of, because of our regulations, having to ask people to leave

363
00:33:25,648 --> 00:33:29,550
And it's not good business and people are losing money.

364
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:37,315
And I wouldn't want to ask businesses to continue to do that when it's illogical and when people are then leaving or not coming at all.

365
00:33:39,136 --> 00:33:46,700
So I am in favor of this, as long as you can continue to be responsive to neighbors to the best of your ability.

366
00:33:50,672 --> 00:34:04,415
When I do get emails from people about noise complaints, I usually follow up with either, depending on who is causing the noise, if it's work or businesses, it'll be the health department or the police department that enforces that stuff.

367
00:34:04,575 --> 00:34:07,455
But you can always also talk to the business owners.

368
00:34:08,096 --> 00:34:11,176
And there are fines if there's multiple violations.

369
00:34:11,256 --> 00:34:13,417
I don't know if it's gone that far with you.

370
00:34:14,777 --> 00:34:19,218
We've had that issue with Wendy's and their trash pickup that they've

371
00:34:19,978 --> 00:34:22,820
broken it a couple of times, then the trash company has to pay a fine.

372
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:27,523
And then eventually they can be charged with not being able to do business in Medford anymore.

373
00:34:27,563 --> 00:34:29,764
I mean, that's the sort of chain of events.

374
00:34:30,025 --> 00:34:34,808
And if that's not occurring, I think then you're probably okay.

375
00:34:36,789 --> 00:34:39,631
So I would just say thanks for bringing this forward.

376
00:34:39,751 --> 00:34:47,936
I think that we as a council have responsibility to our business owners to allow you to do business the way that it is logical.

377
00:34:48,116 --> 00:34:48,777
So thank you.

378
00:34:50,374 --> 00:34:52,416
Thank you Councilor Zaro, Council Vice President Collins.

379
00:34:54,297 --> 00:34:54,618
Thank you.

380
00:34:54,658 --> 00:34:55,258
Thank you for being here.

381
00:34:55,278 --> 00:35:05,728
I think obviously there's a balance to be had here between being reasonably responsive to complaints and requests and noise concerns.

382
00:35:06,308 --> 00:35:07,829
All of us here live in residences.

383
00:35:07,909 --> 00:35:11,953
We know how upsetting it is when it's loud and you're trying to work, you're trying to sleep.

384
00:35:12,674 --> 00:35:16,077
And we have to balance that with letting a commercial district be a commercial district.

385
00:35:17,778 --> 00:35:19,398
I know that going from 11 p.m.

386
00:35:19,959 --> 00:35:21,259
every night to 2 a.m.

387
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:24,221
every night in one fell swoop is a pretty big swing.

388
00:35:24,241 --> 00:35:27,622
I think that there's a balance to be struck here.

389
00:35:27,642 --> 00:35:31,624
I would make a motion to amend this proposal to 7 a.m.

390
00:35:31,664 --> 00:35:32,505
through 2 a.m.

391
00:35:32,685 --> 00:35:34,766
Thursday through Saturday, and 7 a.m.

392
00:35:34,786 --> 00:35:39,288
through midnight Sunday through Wednesday, and to put a 30-, 60-, and 90-day review on that.

393
00:35:39,308 --> 00:35:41,669
Are you guys already 1 a.m.?

394
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:42,110
Yes.

395
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:43,270
They're already 1 a.m.

396
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:44,011
Oh, sorry.

397
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,401
Uh, never mind.

398
00:35:47,802 --> 00:35:49,063
Your hours online were different.

399
00:35:51,405 --> 00:35:52,225
Maybe I didn't see it here.

400
00:35:53,346 --> 00:35:57,450
Um, in that case, I would support extending the two a.m.

401
00:35:57,510 --> 00:36:01,814
closure to Thursday through Saturday and leaving the other days the week as is.

402
00:36:01,834 --> 00:36:09,300
All right.

403
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,242
So the motion is to amend to, uh,

404
00:36:13,765 --> 00:36:14,046
7 a.m.

405
00:36:14,146 --> 00:36:14,626
to 2 a.m.

406
00:36:14,706 --> 00:36:17,269
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and 1 a.m.

407
00:36:17,369 --> 00:36:19,411
on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Sunday.

408
00:36:21,132 --> 00:36:23,375
Sunday, Monday, Wednesday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.

409
00:36:23,395 --> 00:36:24,916
I guess I could have said it that way.

410
00:36:25,857 --> 00:36:26,137
All right.

411
00:36:31,502 --> 00:36:33,164
Do we have any other comments from Councilors?

412
00:36:38,169 --> 00:36:38,349
All right.

413
00:36:40,594 --> 00:36:44,876
Yes, on Sundays, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, it would be 7 AM to 1 AM.

414
00:36:45,816 --> 00:36:49,998
And then on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, it would be 7 AM to 2 AM.

415
00:36:56,241 --> 00:36:56,522
Yes.

416
00:37:08,187 --> 00:37:09,147
What time do we close Monday? 11.

417
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:14,581
So what are your current hours versus what's your license?

418
00:37:14,881 --> 00:37:21,972
Yeah, so our license is longer, but Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, we usually close around at the latest 11 right now.

419
00:37:22,452 --> 00:37:22,652
OK.

420
00:37:22,673 --> 00:37:22,873
So.

421
00:37:25,597 --> 00:37:26,338
Councilor Lemming.

422
00:37:30,423 --> 00:37:33,164
Yeah, I was just a question for all.

423
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:35,104
Do you think, I mean, do you think that the 2 a.m.

424
00:37:35,124 --> 00:37:35,684
to 1 a.m.

425
00:37:36,005 --> 00:37:42,186
difference from what Council Vice President Collins just suggested would make a very big difference for y'all?

426
00:37:42,606 --> 00:37:45,207
Like, do you think that that would be an acceptable compromise in your eyes?

427
00:37:45,227 --> 00:37:47,708
What was the question again, sir?

428
00:37:48,788 --> 00:37:54,690
Do you think that moving the Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday hours from 2 a.m.

429
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:55,950
to 1 a.m.

430
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:59,111
would be an acceptable compromise in your eyes?

431
00:38:00,275 --> 00:38:00,535
Okay.

432
00:38:01,256 --> 00:38:11,784
Yeah, I don't like to hear residents coming in and talking about noise complaints that they didn't get a response to.

433
00:38:11,824 --> 00:38:12,925
I don't like to hear that.

434
00:38:13,846 --> 00:38:20,611
What I also don't like to hear about is a company putting a big investment into

435
00:38:22,556 --> 00:38:33,379
Medford in a place that we're really trying to do business development and then having it fail because the city council wasn't willing to be flexible and work with businesses.

436
00:38:33,459 --> 00:38:37,419
So this is, I think that this is a, this is a balancing act.

437
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:44,021
Um, I want to see businesses that decide to invest in our community do well.

438
00:38:44,501 --> 00:38:51,723
And I want to do everything that we can within reason to support that effort, because it is very important for the future of the city.

439
00:38:51,823 --> 00:38:52,103
Thank you.

440
00:39:00,097 --> 00:39:00,578
Thank you.

441
00:39:00,598 --> 00:39:01,239
We will go to

442
00:39:06,256 --> 00:39:09,398
So I just have a frank question for you guys.

443
00:39:10,019 --> 00:39:29,376
Do you think that staying open until two, you would be able to be pretty successful if you were not having the loud music on the, you know, like if an event ended, you know, if like a music event or something ended at one, but then you stayed open until two o'clock, like, can it be quieter?

444
00:39:29,396 --> 00:39:31,117
I know that we can't like write that into the,

445
00:39:31,898 --> 00:39:58,245
the rules here we kind of binary but do you think that you'd be more successful if you know and would you basically sort of commit to making every effort to keep the noise down after one o'clock yes absolutely absolutely yeah yeah like no one's outside everything's off outside the lights are off so everyone's inside that would make me feel more comfortable um if like you're aware that

446
00:39:59,308 --> 00:40:07,122
That is an issue and making your best at like people can have as good a time as they want to indoors without the you know music layering and all that stuff.

447
00:40:08,304 --> 00:40:08,585
Thank you.

448
00:40:10,468 --> 00:40:11,690
Thank you, Councilor Sang.

449
00:40:12,673 --> 00:40:13,053
Thank you.

450
00:40:13,894 --> 00:40:16,375
First of all, thank you for doing business in Medford.

451
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:22,918
I think the Great American Beer Hall has brought a lot of change to our city, which is good.

452
00:40:23,298 --> 00:40:29,421
I think residents are really excited and really grateful for having it in Medford and for all the work that you guys are doing here.

453
00:40:30,121 --> 00:40:39,386
I think residents will be very excited about Nassau Donuts moving in and excited for more late night pizza, to be honest.

454
00:40:40,341 --> 00:40:42,318
Um, I uh

455
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:47,041
I had a similar question to Councilor Collins, and I'm grateful for your answer.

456
00:40:47,061 --> 00:40:54,965
I guess my remaining question, this is, you know, as Councilor Lemming said, it is a balancing act.

457
00:40:55,226 --> 00:40:59,248
We have to hear, you know, the residents who aren't happy and act on it.

458
00:40:59,288 --> 00:41:06,712
We also have to stand up for the residents who do wanna see this in Medford as well, but also to help businesses out.

459
00:41:06,752 --> 00:41:09,754
And I wanna know if this 1 a.m.

460
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:11,314
change, you guys said it was adequate,

461
00:41:12,892 --> 00:41:17,296
How does that affect the competitiveness with neighboring communities?

462
00:41:17,836 --> 00:41:21,680
Is this a good enough of a step in the right direction?

463
00:41:24,189 --> 00:41:45,349
Well, going to 2am on the weekends will be a big help because we lose a lot of our crowd around 10pm 1030 to places like the burn on core the harp in Boston, and they come to us first they might order pizza and then they leave, because they want to stay out later, and those an incident recently where there's a wedding party and they are staying at the row hotel.

464
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:52,993
And they called us to see if they could send two buses with the party guests after the wedding to the Bayer Hall.

465
00:41:53,033 --> 00:41:54,234
They called at 1130.

466
00:41:54,994 --> 00:41:59,037
And we told them, well, yeah, but right now we have a 1230 last call.

467
00:41:59,397 --> 00:42:02,098
So they ended up taking them elsewhere that 2am.

468
00:42:02,158 --> 00:42:05,660
So it definitely impacts us pretty, like significantly.

469
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:09,782
Yeah, you could definitely pull like bigger parties and stuff like that.

470
00:42:10,218 --> 00:42:14,586
The other good thing is the nighttime people tend to come by way of Uber.

471
00:42:14,606 --> 00:42:20,037
There are still a lot of people that drive, but we have way less of a parking problem at night than we do during the day.

472
00:42:21,312 --> 00:42:22,453
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

473
00:42:23,373 --> 00:42:26,455
And is that something that you mostly see on Thursday, Friday, Saturdays?

474
00:42:27,115 --> 00:42:30,676
Yes, mostly Friday and Saturday, like Thursday nights.

475
00:42:30,896 --> 00:42:34,338
I mean, we get a good crowd, but they typically die off earlier.

476
00:42:34,378 --> 00:42:38,760
And part of the reason why is a lot of the younger crowd goes to the Baron in Somerville.

477
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:40,481
Like we've gone there, we've seen it.

478
00:42:41,182 --> 00:42:46,385
So we're just trying to get some of that crowd to come to us because they're actually leaving to go there.

479
00:42:46,525 --> 00:42:46,745
Right.

480
00:42:46,765 --> 00:42:47,946
So we don't want that.

481
00:42:48,627 --> 00:42:49,707
And they charge a cover there.

482
00:42:49,747 --> 00:42:50,187
We don't.

483
00:42:50,288 --> 00:42:52,469
So they're paying money to go elsewhere.

484
00:42:52,489 --> 00:42:54,190
So thank you.

485
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:54,790
Fair enough.

486
00:42:55,090 --> 00:43:00,894
Thank you for that answer for, you know, teaching a little bit about what you guys are seeing about on your side as well.

487
00:43:02,195 --> 00:43:02,635
Thank you.

488
00:43:02,695 --> 00:43:04,036
Counselor saying counselor Callahan.

489
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:06,537
Thanks, just a little follow up.

490
00:43:06,717 --> 00:43:16,860
I'm hoping and kind of assuming that we're going to have a 30, 60, 90 day follow up to this change so we can check in with residents and make sure that it's working out.

491
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:25,422
And then also wanted to say that you guys are going to have some stiff competition with Donuts with a Difference, which makes amazing donuts.

492
00:43:25,542 --> 00:43:30,064
So we'll see how, as a donut person, I'm excited to do a comparison.

493
00:43:30,224 --> 00:43:30,624
Awesome.

494
00:43:30,824 --> 00:43:31,144
Perfect.

495
00:43:34,498 --> 00:43:39,641
All right, do you have any more questions for the petitioner?

496
00:43:41,182 --> 00:43:43,444
Seeing none, we'll go to public participation.

497
00:43:43,524 --> 00:43:46,986
Is there anyone else who would like to speak on this issue, either in person or on Zoom?

498
00:43:47,026 --> 00:43:49,688
If you'd like to speak in person, you can come to the podium.

499
00:43:50,168 --> 00:43:54,391
If you'd like to speak on Zoom, you can raise your hand and we'll come back to you guys.

500
00:43:56,112 --> 00:43:57,213
Thanks, you can come to the podium.

501
00:43:57,473 --> 00:44:00,695
Hi, name and address for the record, and you'll have three minutes.

502
00:44:00,915 --> 00:44:02,916
Yeah, Carol O'Brien, 49 Hancock Street.

503
00:44:04,859 --> 00:44:11,578
method was that on behalf of myself, my family and the numerous residents who have generously signed the petition.

504
00:44:11,598 --> 00:44:13,002
Thank you.

505
00:44:14,185 --> 00:44:26,567
and we are writing to formally address the ongoing issues of loud music disturbances originated from events at the Great American Beer Hall, particularly on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights, often lasts till 12 o'clock a.m.

506
00:44:27,407 --> 00:44:36,449
After long work days, many of us look forward to quiet evenings to rest, and unfortunately, beginning as early as 9 p.m., the music stops.

507
00:44:36,869 --> 00:44:43,070
It disrupts us, intrusive and deeply unsettling to the peaceful atmosphere our neighborhood has long enjoyed.

508
00:44:43,810 --> 00:44:55,163
During the initial community zoom meeting, when asked if music would be part of the great American events on Brian's author confirmed there would be live music yes there would be.

509
00:44:55,584 --> 00:44:59,248
However, he assured the community, you will not hear the music.

510
00:44:59,748 --> 00:45:04,911
and emphasize it be contained inside the venue with all doors and windows closed.

511
00:45:05,632 --> 00:45:14,938
What was not disclosed was the use of outside speakers, now I think there is eight of them, DJs and amplified sound that now frequently spills into the neighborhood.

512
00:45:15,438 --> 00:45:19,161
The community was led to believe there would be minimal, if any, disruption.

513
00:45:19,881 --> 00:45:22,002
Unfortunately, this has not been the case.

514
00:45:23,003 --> 00:45:29,587
Despite requests to turn speakers inward and reduce the volume, those concerns have gone unaddressed.

515
00:45:30,028 --> 00:45:37,533
The loud music, especially the deep basses from the DJ sets, has become a source of stress and frustration.

516
00:45:38,153 --> 00:45:45,418
Many residents have resorted to using earplugs, sound machines, raising their TV volumes, turning on their ACs,

517
00:45:45,994 --> 00:45:50,917
and even installing triple pane windows in an effort to reclaim some peace in their homes.

518
00:45:51,638 --> 00:46:00,703
While we understand the Great American Beer Hall operates as a business, our community should not have to suffer the consequences of accessible noise.

519
00:46:01,164 --> 00:46:02,184
We were here first.

520
00:46:02,825 --> 00:46:09,129
The Great American Beer Hall should make reasonable accommodation for the community, not the other way around.

521
00:46:09,749 --> 00:46:13,572
Therefore, we respectfully request that all outdoor music be shut down at 9 p.m.

522
00:46:14,757 --> 00:46:22,181
With any remaining performances moved indoors and fully, fully contained, so they are no longer audible to the surrounding neighborhood.

523
00:46:23,602 --> 00:46:26,543
Brian's after once said method is a loving community.

524
00:46:26,923 --> 00:46:33,487
We asked him in the great American beer hall to reflect that love by being considerate of the very community that welcome them.

525
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:41,452
We had, there was an event, a private event that happened, and it lasted till one o'clock in the morning.

526
00:46:41,792 --> 00:46:54,736
And there was DJs, and by 1.30, quarter of two, there were groups of people walking down, and parking is another issue, walking down our streets, White Street, Hancock Street, Willis Ave, loud.

527
00:46:54,976 --> 00:47:00,298
One lady came across Hancock to Willis Ave, beeping the horn, beep, beep, beep, let off the alarm.

528
00:47:00,898 --> 00:47:06,401
The owner came out and said, you know, what are you doing a small children and woke up the neighborhood.

529
00:47:06,761 --> 00:47:12,404
The next day, I neighbor Joe was picking up solar cups, all over the trash that they, they left.

530
00:47:12,804 --> 00:47:16,706
I spoke to a lot of the, you know, a lot of the residents and they, they don't.

531
00:47:17,446 --> 00:47:22,008
hear how long the beer hall is open till it's the music that is just too loud.

532
00:47:22,108 --> 00:47:35,035
I mean, we look on the menu and say, Oh, this is to 12 o'clock I'm like, Oh, I'm gonna be able to sleep this you know I mean it's just too loud and especially with the vibration of the DJ with the bang bang bang bang bang you hear it.

533
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:45,439
Some one resident said he has beats, and with the beats in his ears he can still hear the vibration, bang bang bang all the way, and it's the music, it's just too loud.

534
00:47:45,459 --> 00:47:48,980
We're 100 yards away from this Brea Hall.

535
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:53,722
I wish that the Brea Hall was turned the other way with the, you know, the garden would be facing the highway.

536
00:47:54,305 --> 00:48:08,735
You know, but it's not, and it's just very, you know, it's too loud for us, and we want to live a nice quiet, you know, come home, and especially we want to relax, and you hear this, you know, and you just, it's very unsettling.

537
00:48:09,516 --> 00:48:09,836
Thank you.

538
00:48:09,876 --> 00:48:10,516
Yeah, thank you.

539
00:48:10,977 --> 00:48:12,737
I spoke with our economic development director.

540
00:48:12,757 --> 00:48:16,139
And I think he had some thoughts on the on the music specifically.

541
00:48:16,659 --> 00:48:18,180
So I do see his hand.

542
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:20,721
But before I go to him, is there anyone else who wants to speak on this?

543
00:48:20,941 --> 00:48:30,546
He was here or on zoom if anyone else would like to come to the podium and talk about this, their experience or, or raise your hand on zoom before I go to our economic development director.

544
00:48:30,566 --> 00:48:35,948
Hi, how you doing, Matt?

545
00:48:37,238 --> 00:48:38,739
Yeah, name and address for the record, please.

546
00:48:39,139 --> 00:48:43,201
Matthew Anders, White Street, 14 White Street.

547
00:48:44,001 --> 00:48:46,242
So yeah, so I've lived in the area for a couple of years now.

548
00:48:47,063 --> 00:48:52,685
I love the Medford transformation, what's happened downtown, the Irish bar, you know, the pizza restaurant, all that stuff.

549
00:48:52,785 --> 00:48:54,286
Very excited for the Great American Beer Hall.

550
00:48:54,566 --> 00:48:57,768
I actually go, I used to go quite a lot.

551
00:48:58,168 --> 00:49:00,249
I love the live music, had lots of pizzas there.

552
00:49:00,269 --> 00:49:01,069
I mean, there were a lot of people.

553
00:49:02,767 --> 00:49:07,189
So for me, it's like what happened was one night I was, I get very, like I need to have a sleep.

554
00:49:07,269 --> 00:49:09,449
I literally could hear the bass coming into my bedroom.

555
00:49:10,010 --> 00:49:16,852
I live on like the fourth floor in a brand new build with like insulation that's up to code.

556
00:49:16,992 --> 00:49:18,393
It's a very, very deep insulation.

557
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:18,993
That's the bass.

558
00:49:19,912 --> 00:49:21,553
My career happens to be in audio visual.

559
00:49:21,573 --> 00:49:27,836
I fit out a lot of offices and we put a lot of acoustic panels into the places to actually absorb the sound.

560
00:49:28,477 --> 00:49:34,560
So I think one of the key issues is acoustic paneling in the place to absorb some noise, so the noise doesn't travel out.

561
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:39,602
So obviously to do that, you mentioned earlier about these 30, 60, 90 days reviews.

562
00:49:39,642 --> 00:49:45,023
I would like to see what is the decimal rating if you're down the road and you actually take decimal ratings at certain times.

563
00:49:45,384 --> 00:49:46,604
Is that an acceptable rating?

564
00:49:46,624 --> 00:49:48,825
You have a state law that has certain ratings.

565
00:49:49,285 --> 00:49:50,125
This would not pass.

566
00:49:50,605 --> 00:49:55,187
So I think, like people have said here, the key is not the amount of time it's open to.

567
00:49:55,267 --> 00:50:01,129
If it's open till 2 AM and they fix the acoustic problem, everyone's going to be very, very happy and there's going to be no concerns.

568
00:50:01,469 --> 00:50:03,590
And you'll find that the neighbors will probably start going there.

569
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:05,591
So right now it's fixing the sounds.

570
00:50:05,631 --> 00:50:08,494
I don't believe it's the outdoor speakers myself, because they're small sounds.

571
00:50:08,594 --> 00:50:10,575
It tends to be the louder bass noise.

572
00:50:10,695 --> 00:50:15,159
And it tends to be on the Fridays when we have the DJs, not so much when it's the live bands as well.

573
00:50:15,619 --> 00:50:26,548
So I think looking into that, having an understanding, having someone that attends with a professional audio visual background that can make recommendations before these hours are approved, I believe will actually help.

574
00:50:27,428 --> 00:50:29,770
And yeah, like I said, I'm happy to go back.

575
00:50:29,830 --> 00:50:32,572
If I start sleeping normally, I'll be their first customer back.

576
00:50:32,913 --> 00:50:33,213
So yeah.

577
00:50:34,969 --> 00:50:35,369
That's it.

578
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:36,750
Thank you very much.

579
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:37,310
Thank you.

580
00:50:40,852 --> 00:50:42,773
Is there anyone else who'd like to speak on this matter?

581
00:50:42,793 --> 00:50:42,873
Sure.

582
00:50:43,954 --> 00:50:46,275
Go to the podium, name and address for the record.

583
00:50:46,756 --> 00:50:47,376
You have three minutes.

584
00:50:48,597 --> 00:50:49,197
Sure, yeah.

585
00:50:49,217 --> 00:50:50,678
Micah Kesselman, 499 Main Street.

586
00:50:52,579 --> 00:50:55,100
I did not come here expecting to talk about this.

587
00:50:56,221 --> 00:51:03,265
But I do want to note that I am our representative on the Massport Logan

588
00:51:04,301 --> 00:51:05,342
relationship committee.

589
00:51:06,042 --> 00:51:09,324
And one of the things we deal with a lot is airplane noise complaints.

590
00:51:09,824 --> 00:51:17,669
And we do a lot of educational stuff on the deleterious effects of noise, of high noise levels on residents, especially at night.

591
00:51:17,789 --> 00:51:30,297
So if your establishment is getting like this amount of complaints about it, like this is a big deal and it actually has negative health outcomes potentially on the local residents.

592
00:51:31,218 --> 00:51:33,299
It is something to really take seriously, I think.

593
00:51:34,066 --> 00:51:52,038
I what I think might be a good compromise is if they would agree to sort of heightened fines if there is a noise complaint that is filed and the cops show up and actually assess that there is noise during this sort of trial period.

594
00:51:53,446 --> 00:52:04,313
so that they can basically put their money where their mouth is and that they actually are trying to address this issue that can actually have pretty negative health outcomes for people who are experiencing it and who are sensitive to it.

595
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:06,454
So that's just sort of my thoughts on this.

596
00:52:07,134 --> 00:52:16,741
I am not super forward, like I have not heard, had issues with the noise, but I'm also like five blocks or more away from the beer hall, but it is nice to have a business like that there.

597
00:52:17,141 --> 00:52:19,502
So I would like to see it not,

598
00:52:21,965 --> 00:52:25,087
screw it up and make it viable, so.

599
00:52:26,869 --> 00:52:27,369
Thank you.

600
00:52:27,389 --> 00:52:32,333
All right, I'm gonna go to our economic development director.

601
00:52:32,473 --> 00:52:35,035
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna go to the economic development director on Zoom.

602
00:52:35,835 --> 00:52:47,424
Sal, if you could just let us know what your thoughts are and if you could talk about some of the restrictions on live music that we talked about, or music in general.

603
00:52:47,524 --> 00:52:48,064
Absolutely.

604
00:52:49,205 --> 00:52:50,346
Mr. President, can you hear me?

605
00:52:51,413 --> 00:52:51,673
Yes.

606
00:52:52,054 --> 00:52:52,274
Great.

607
00:52:52,414 --> 00:52:53,135
Thank you.

608
00:52:53,155 --> 00:52:53,976
But we can hear you.

609
00:52:54,456 --> 00:52:54,697
Great.

610
00:52:54,777 --> 00:52:55,217
Thank you.

611
00:52:55,237 --> 00:52:59,642
I appreciate the opportunity to speak.

612
00:53:00,548 --> 00:53:02,670
on behalf of Great American Beer Halls petition.

613
00:53:04,071 --> 00:53:16,840
What I do want to say is I hear everybody loud and clear about the need to be a good neighbor and to take measures to reduce noise.

614
00:53:18,181 --> 00:53:21,203
What I do have to say is that

615
00:53:23,765 --> 00:53:32,202
When I did receive a complaint recently regarding a live event, I immediately contacted

616
00:53:34,692 --> 00:53:37,973
John and Brian, and they took action immediately.

617
00:53:38,013 --> 00:53:39,334
They took responsibility.

618
00:53:40,534 --> 00:53:53,618
I saw an email that went out from their general manager to employees, and one of the things that they voluntarily agreed to was to stop outdoor music at 9 p.m.

619
00:53:54,258 --> 00:53:55,819
and to shut all the doors and

620
00:53:56,219 --> 00:54:03,525
including the big garage door that's at the building to keep the noise inside.

621
00:54:04,526 --> 00:54:18,638
Also, at our request, they did alert patrons via signage and verbally asking them to be respectful of neighbors as they exit the premises.

622
00:54:19,458 --> 00:54:22,719
Um, so they took those immediate actions.

623
00:54:23,699 --> 00:54:31,921
Um, I, I definitely understand where, uh, counselor scar Polly is coming from, um, needing to see the proof.

624
00:54:32,421 --> 00:54:39,983
What I can do, what I can say is from every conversation I had, um, they have learned from their mistakes.

625
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:41,683
They want to be a good neighbor.

626
00:54:42,323 --> 00:54:47,865
Um, and on the, for economic development, we want to be good to businesses.

627
00:54:47,985 --> 00:54:48,805
We want,

628
00:54:49,125 --> 00:54:56,266
meant for it to be known as a place that will support our small businesses and we also want to be competitive.

629
00:54:57,246 --> 00:55:15,709
It's not fair to our businesses if people could just cross the municipal lines and go to our neighboring communities and enjoy beverages later just because we aren't taking action.

630
00:55:15,749 --> 00:55:16,950
We're not modernizing our

631
00:55:26,293 --> 00:55:28,776
We lost you at modernizing.

632
00:55:28,796 --> 00:55:30,538
Sorry, could you hear me counselor?

633
00:55:30,558 --> 00:55:31,699
Your service isn't great.

634
00:55:31,719 --> 00:55:36,404
We lost you after the word modernizing.

635
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:53,403
So sorry, I'm in a bad patch driving my son home from a soccer game in West Roxbury.

636
00:55:53,863 --> 00:55:54,704
I apologize.

637
00:55:56,044 --> 00:56:03,608
Bottom line is that I hope we can find a compromise here and support this petition.

638
00:56:04,368 --> 00:56:07,670
And I thank everybody for their consideration.

639
00:56:11,471 --> 00:56:11,912
Thank you.

640
00:56:14,653 --> 00:56:14,833
Thanks.

641
00:56:17,318 --> 00:56:17,598
All right.

642
00:56:18,218 --> 00:56:21,619
Go to Vice President Collins and then Councilor Lemming.

643
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:22,880
I have a few questions myself.

644
00:56:24,581 --> 00:56:24,801
Sure.

645
00:56:24,861 --> 00:56:25,161
Thank you.

646
00:56:25,181 --> 00:56:43,387
I just wanted to note that it sounds like at every step, Great American Beer Hall has tried to be responsive to specific suggestions and solutions that have been proposed to the business, and I do want to note that, and that gives me a feeling of optimism that if we kind of collaboratively reorient toward solutions that maybe, you know, I think the effort is there.

647
00:56:43,407 --> 00:56:45,008
What we need to do now is make sure that the

648
00:56:47,248 --> 00:56:50,690
You know, the noise amelioration is really we're using the strategies that work the best.

649
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:56,474
I heard it's heartening to know that we have an actual AV engineer in the community I'm sure he's not the only one.

650
00:56:56,994 --> 00:57:04,319
Maybe a next step here is to take a look at what are the interventions that are really making a difference what are the ones that seem like they should make a difference but because of sound waves.

651
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:06,821
They're not having the effect that they should.

652
00:57:07,681 --> 00:57:17,704
Um, I've been to, uh, many a, you know, brewery style event hall myself that is just incredibly loud because of how the walls are and how echoey it is.

653
00:57:18,264 --> 00:57:25,646
So it seems like there's, um, ground here that we haven't tread on yet that might be having a bigger effect, um, than what's already been tried.

654
00:57:25,886 --> 00:57:35,969
So maybe we can, I think if there's a strong commitment and review period that we can try the things that seem like they'll have a better success rate, maybe we can have the extended hours with decreased complaints at the same time.

655
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:42,512
Thank you, go to Councilor Lemming then Councilor Callahan.

656
00:57:42,552 --> 00:57:43,152
Councilor Lemming.

657
00:57:43,952 --> 00:58:02,977
Yeah, this is definitely one of those things where I would take the review period, very seriously, but it does, it does sound like, you know, adding, adding more noise wouldn't necessarily help out the business, because that's not what people were asking for by what you told by the anecdote that you just said but

658
00:58:03,457 --> 00:58:11,959
extending the hours and doing something about the noise would overall help out both the businesses and the neighbors.

659
00:58:11,999 --> 00:58:29,603
So I do see this as kind of two different things, and I don't really see it that we need to, you know, I mean, punish a business for having some growing pains with the neighboring community, which does sound like it had a detrimental effect on

660
00:58:30,183 --> 00:58:31,164
Um, you know, I don't want to, um.

661
00:58:31,184 --> 00:58:32,085
Many of the neighbors.

662
00:58:32,225 --> 00:58:37,109
But if we can just, you know, be responsive to that sort of sort of work with them compromise.

663
00:58:37,349 --> 00:58:41,032
Um I don't I mean, City Council can drag its feet.

664
00:58:41,052 --> 00:58:42,633
So I think that if we were to wait another.

665
00:58:43,634 --> 00:58:51,741
Six months, um, to approve these hours, um, with, uh, Uh, and with the

666
00:58:58,727 --> 00:58:59,327
on business.

667
00:58:59,507 --> 00:59:15,335
So to me, in my mind, the best solution is to have the review period, have it very carefully see if the effects of the very loud noise are still there.

668
00:59:15,355 --> 00:59:25,901
And if the neighbors still notice it, but at the same time help out the businesses that are opening up nearby so that they don't all go over to the burn and we can start stealing business from Somerville.

669
00:59:26,781 --> 00:59:37,927
Hopefully, but no, I'd like to thank both you as well as the residents from the neighborhood for coming over and telling their story.

670
00:59:37,988 --> 00:59:53,096
And hopefully, you know, you'll be able to get the money for maybe a sound engineer to improve the acoustics of the place, like, you know, have some of those like foam panels on the side so that it doesn't quite go out into the community as much.

671
00:59:53,496 --> 00:59:54,597
But so thank you.

672
00:59:59,030 --> 01:00:00,311
Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

673
01:00:00,331 --> 01:00:02,413
Thank you.

674
01:00:03,253 --> 01:00:09,858
I hope that you hear that I certainly and many members of the councilors really want you to be successful and want to approve these hours.

675
01:00:10,299 --> 01:00:20,046
I think for me personally, I want to see improvements on the neighbor's experience before increasing the hours.

676
01:00:20,086 --> 01:00:22,348
I think that's just how I feel personally.

677
01:00:22,368 --> 01:00:25,891
So I don't think I'm gonna vote in favor of these hours right now.

678
01:00:28,113 --> 01:00:43,465
I am not a sound engineer, but I really took to the comments saying that, you know, maybe hiring somebody for some small consulting to really dig deep into how you can ameliorate those issues and working with the neighbors.

679
01:00:43,725 --> 01:00:46,508
And I would love to see you come back if this does not pass.

680
01:00:47,909 --> 01:00:50,291
And because I want you to be successful and

681
01:01:07,748 --> 01:01:08,609
Thank you, just one second.

682
01:01:17,397 --> 01:01:20,180
All right, we'll go back to you guys.

683
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:24,945
If you wanna talk about maybe additional mitigation, you might be willing to consider around the sound.

684
01:01:26,550 --> 01:01:32,333
You know, I was in there with you guys when it was a shell, and then I was in there right after you had opened.

685
01:01:32,433 --> 01:01:34,034
And, you know, it's a big space.

686
01:01:34,734 --> 01:01:37,856
And I mean, we're really glad that it's been a successful business.

687
01:01:37,876 --> 01:01:42,738
But one thing I will say, I have noticed when I've been in there is it's a big space, and there's a lot of noise bouncing around.

688
01:01:42,838 --> 01:01:49,862
So it doesn't surprise me that we've had some of the noise, maybe, you know, that that building's maybe not capturing all of it.

689
01:01:49,922 --> 01:01:51,903
So I was wondering if maybe you could talk a little bit more about that.

690
01:01:53,022 --> 01:01:55,223
The garage door is our biggest issue.

691
01:01:55,303 --> 01:01:59,085
So when the garage door is shut, it's like night and day.

692
01:01:59,605 --> 01:02:00,426
You can't hear outside.

693
01:02:00,446 --> 01:02:06,689
When the door is open and we have the DJ or the band up back, it just flows down and it goes into the street.

694
01:02:08,033 --> 01:02:12,036
The key for us is getting that door closed at 9pm every night, which we were not doing.

695
01:02:12,556 --> 01:02:18,420
So it was a learning curve, something that we talked to with Sal, and we came back and said, hey, we got to get this door shut.

696
01:02:19,581 --> 01:02:23,064
And that's the only way that we're going to mitigate the noise going down the street.

697
01:02:23,524 --> 01:02:25,125
And how long have you been close to that?

698
01:02:25,265 --> 01:02:25,946
Like a week and a half.

699
01:02:26,306 --> 01:02:26,846
A week and a half.

700
01:02:26,986 --> 01:02:27,707
Yeah, right.

701
01:02:28,562 --> 01:02:35,387
If you don't mind, I do and I normally wouldn't do this to just someone who spoke in public comment, but to our friend who is the sound person.

702
01:02:35,947 --> 01:02:37,028
Have you noticed a difference.

703
01:02:37,688 --> 01:02:39,149
Since the garage doors been closed.

704
01:02:42,071 --> 01:02:42,591
Last Friday.

705
01:02:48,673 --> 01:02:50,074
If you could come, could you come to the podium?

706
01:02:50,114 --> 01:02:54,137
Sorry, I gotta, if we're gonna say more than a thumbs up or a thumbs down, we gotta hear your name.

707
01:02:54,497 --> 01:03:00,641
I'm Joe shelves and I live on White Street and it's gotten better in the past week or two, the noise better.

708
01:03:01,522 --> 01:03:08,286
But you know, again, the noise continues, not only their hours, which is, I understand that we want their business to succeed.

709
01:03:08,746 --> 01:03:12,069
No question about that because I want my life to succeed also.

710
01:03:12,489 --> 01:03:16,792
So all the people that go there late, they come out of there,

711
01:03:17,465 --> 01:03:25,270
half in a bag, and they come out of there yelling and screaming with their mugs and cups and everything else, and they drop it on the street.

712
01:03:25,630 --> 01:03:34,716
Well, on my street, at the end of the street, which meets Willis, the trash was there for a week, and it's beer bottles, it's all kinds of crap.

713
01:03:35,077 --> 01:03:35,737
I have to pick it up.

714
01:03:35,837 --> 01:03:39,500
I like to keep my street clean, because I think that reflects the neighborhood.

715
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:44,543
But you know, I walked around the neighborhood actually this past weekend, horrible.

716
01:03:45,514 --> 01:03:47,355
I've been there for almost 40 years.

717
01:03:48,895 --> 01:03:49,856
This is the worst.

718
01:03:50,796 --> 01:03:52,777
I couldn't believe what I saw in the streets.

719
01:03:53,617 --> 01:03:54,637
I'm not saying they're neat.

720
01:03:55,118 --> 01:03:58,359
I have to admit to that, because I don't see as much on their side.

721
01:03:58,699 --> 01:04:03,121
But I think it's the neighborhood in that area that it's gotten worse and worse.

722
01:04:03,541 --> 01:04:06,142
So I think something needs to be done about cleaning it up.

723
01:04:07,322 --> 01:04:10,583
I used to see trucks coming around once a month sweeping the streets.

724
01:04:11,063 --> 01:04:11,904
I don't see anybody.

725
01:04:12,084 --> 01:04:14,625
If I don't sweep my street, it sits there.

726
01:04:15,458 --> 01:04:23,643
Unfair, I'm a taxpayer, they pay taxes, and I don't know if you guys live in a neighborhood, so if you don't, you don't know what goes on there.

727
01:04:24,824 --> 01:04:26,625
I do, almost 40 years.

728
01:04:27,326 --> 01:04:29,907
It used to be beautiful, not now.

729
01:04:31,448 --> 01:04:32,829
Again, I want them to succeed.

730
01:04:34,110 --> 01:04:40,514
I respect them and I hope they respect me and they respect the neighborhood, but that's not the right way, all right?

731
01:04:40,874 --> 01:04:41,795
Thank you, I appreciate it.

732
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:46,861
So it sounds like it might be somewhat better.

733
01:04:48,382 --> 01:04:56,928
But, you know, it's only been doing it, you've only had one, one DJ night since then, it sounds like so, you know, a lot of sample sites to go on here.

734
01:04:58,529 --> 01:05:11,899
You know, I had spoken with our economic development director, I think, if we put the condition of no outdoor music and closing the door at 9pm, 9pm, and also would recommend

735
01:05:13,195 --> 01:05:16,698
maybe a little bit of a different look, 30 days, 90 days and 180 days.

736
01:05:16,718 --> 01:05:19,440
So that would be October 9th, December 9th and March 9th.

737
01:05:19,940 --> 01:05:23,703
If we get the noise complaints, any noise complaints or code complaints.

738
01:05:23,763 --> 01:05:31,308
So to folks, if you're hearing noise or if you are seeing something in the neighborhood, send that to the code enforcement team.

739
01:05:31,828 --> 01:05:33,449
They will send that information to us.

740
01:05:34,010 --> 01:05:37,092
And then we would be able to review those complaints at each of those junctures.

741
01:05:37,672 --> 01:05:39,773
And if we have to go back to the 1 a.m.

742
01:05:39,833 --> 01:05:41,655
time, if we're seeing a significant impact,

743
01:05:42,575 --> 01:05:48,240
That would be a way that we could take in the complaints that residents in the neighborhood are sending if there continue to be issues.

744
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:57,527
Maybe we come back and have another conversation at one of those points about additional sound stuff or some some changes that you guys have been thinking about and we can continue the conversation.

745
01:05:57,607 --> 01:06:02,631
But I think those would be conditions that we could we could see if this works.

746
01:06:02,691 --> 01:06:04,793
And if it doesn't work, we could talk about more solutions.

747
01:06:06,074 --> 01:06:06,835
Absolutely.

748
01:06:06,855 --> 01:06:07,075
Okay.

749
01:06:08,970 --> 01:06:12,512
Would someone just amend to include those conditions?

750
01:06:13,532 --> 01:06:14,433
Thank you, Councilor Sanders.

751
01:06:16,214 --> 01:06:21,456
So we have a motion by Vice President Collins to approve as amended to 7 a.m.

752
01:06:21,536 --> 01:06:22,217
to 1 a.m.

753
01:06:22,377 --> 01:06:23,537
Sunday through Wednesday, 7 a.m.

754
01:06:23,958 --> 01:06:24,978
to 2 a.m.

755
01:06:25,078 --> 01:06:30,001
Thursday to Saturday with the conditions of no outdoor music and closing the large door at 9 p.m.

756
01:06:31,464 --> 01:06:45,243
and then a 30 day, 90 day and 180 day review to request that the building department and code enforcement send complaints that they receive about this to the council so that we can, if we have to consider reverting back to the earlier hours.

757
01:06:47,686 --> 01:06:48,488
Councilor Scarpelli.

758
01:06:49,689 --> 01:07:03,976
Because I just want to dispel some rumors or whatever was said a lot of people saying people leaving your establishment with alcohol that we know that doesn't happen I know that that's not your style, I know that you're very, so I think that we, you know, I know that this.

759
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:11,822
If you could just elaborate a little bit that because I think people might be getting a little more concerned now that hold on one second, they're letting them leave without call.

760
01:07:12,182 --> 01:07:13,142
I know that doesn't happen.

761
01:07:13,202 --> 01:07:15,062
So if you can just help with that.

762
01:07:15,442 --> 01:07:17,203
Yeah, so we have security at night.

763
01:07:17,583 --> 01:07:23,124
And we have essentially the main entrance open and you can exit by the patio as well to leave.

764
01:07:23,504 --> 01:07:25,085
And we have security at both doors.

765
01:07:25,125 --> 01:07:30,246
So they're definitely not letting people walk outside with like liquor or anything.

766
01:07:30,586 --> 01:07:33,547
They won't even let you leave with like a water cup at night.

767
01:07:33,947 --> 01:07:34,187
So

768
01:07:35,275 --> 01:07:37,857
I don't know where all the trash is coming from.

769
01:07:37,877 --> 01:07:44,704
I will say this probably been sometimes people are walking to our establishment and they're like pre-gaming on the way there.

770
01:07:45,264 --> 01:07:51,130
And I think they tend to throw trash, knock them alive, but it's definitely not leaving our establishment going out.

771
01:07:54,453 --> 01:07:54,653
Thank you.

772
01:07:56,413 --> 01:07:56,813
Thank you.

773
01:07:58,034 --> 01:08:03,456
And what do you guys do in regards to trash, like in the immediate vicinity of your, you know, if you see something on the sidewalk?

774
01:08:04,257 --> 01:08:12,400
Yeah, yeah, we have, we have someone there five days a week picking up trash in the morning at our site, so we keep it very clean, that's really important.

775
01:08:12,821 --> 01:08:15,302
Does that extend to like missing out maybe across the street?

776
01:08:15,322 --> 01:08:16,782
Yeah, I do the, I do 134, 151, and 142.

777
01:08:16,863 --> 01:08:17,023
Okay.

778
01:08:17,043 --> 01:08:17,283
All right.

779
01:08:22,698 --> 01:08:24,700
Do we have any more questions from members of the council?

780
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:26,981
Or do we need the motion read back?

781
01:08:30,684 --> 01:08:39,271
Seeing none, on the motion by Vice President Collins to approve as amended with conditions, seconded by Councilor Lemming, and again, this would be 7 a.m.

782
01:08:39,331 --> 01:08:40,132
to 1 a.m.

783
01:08:40,532 --> 01:08:43,435
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, 7 a.m.

784
01:08:43,455 --> 01:08:44,115
to 2 a.m.

785
01:08:44,255 --> 01:08:45,576
Thursday, Friday, Saturday.

786
01:08:46,237 --> 01:08:50,060
They cannot have outdoor music and have to close the large door.

787
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:50,941
They call it the garage door.

788
01:08:50,981 --> 01:08:52,202
I said it's a large door.

789
01:08:52,762 --> 01:09:01,307
at 9 PM, and then we're going to receive complaints in 30 days, 90 days, and 180 days, any complaints that are sent to our building department and code enforcement.

790
01:09:01,888 --> 01:09:06,911
And if we receive a significant number of complaints, we'll come back and review, pulling those later hours back.

791
01:09:09,872 --> 01:09:10,913
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

792
01:09:13,895 --> 01:09:14,735
Councilor Callahan?

793
01:09:14,755 --> 01:09:14,815
No.

794
01:09:16,697 --> 01:09:17,657
Vice President Collins?

795
01:09:17,677 --> 01:09:17,737
Yes.

796
01:09:19,318 --> 01:09:20,059
Councilor Zaro?

797
01:09:20,079 --> 01:09:20,179
Yes.

798
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:22,220
Councilor Lemming?

799
01:09:23,532 --> 01:09:28,416
Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Singh, President Beyers.

800
01:09:28,636 --> 01:09:31,118
Yes, five in the affirmative, two in the negative, the motion passes.

801
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:36,782
25132, petition for a common mixtures license, Locolito.

802
01:09:37,002 --> 01:09:40,865
Do we have Locolito in person or on the line?

803
01:09:42,066 --> 01:09:43,407
All right, there he is.

804
01:09:44,547 --> 01:09:50,312
The great coffee shop mystery of Medford is here to tell us what his plans are.

805
01:09:51,422 --> 01:09:52,282
Alvaro, how you doing?

806
01:09:52,542 --> 01:09:53,063
Good, thanks.

807
01:09:53,283 --> 01:09:53,883
Good to see you.

808
01:09:54,043 --> 01:09:54,483
Good to see you.

809
01:09:54,503 --> 01:09:56,684
So when am I buying coffee at Localito?

810
01:09:57,004 --> 01:09:57,624
Hopefully soon.

811
01:09:58,004 --> 01:10:02,206
All right, tell us a little bit more about your application.

812
01:10:02,546 --> 01:10:07,968
Well, it's just we're trying to do a neighborhood coffee where you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner.

813
01:10:09,709 --> 01:10:10,389
That's the idea.

814
01:10:11,229 --> 01:10:18,132
So I would love to speak more, but it's basically that just a neighborhood where people can gather in and enjoy a good coffee.

815
01:10:20,182 --> 01:10:20,442
Great.

816
01:10:20,802 --> 01:10:24,065
Do we have any questions for the applicant, Councillor Scarpelli?

817
01:10:24,085 --> 01:10:30,150
I don't know if my colleagues have any questions.

818
01:10:30,210 --> 01:10:40,338
I know 6 to 11 is the time and this is something that's needed and we appreciate your trust in moving here to the City of Medford.

819
01:10:41,612 --> 01:10:43,533
extending all these opportunities, so thank you.

820
01:10:43,753 --> 01:10:45,113
Yeah, we're all excited.

821
01:10:46,033 --> 01:10:54,516
Somebody said on Reddit, they said, if you mention that they post on their social media, it'll be another month before they open, so.

822
01:10:55,516 --> 01:11:01,358
We got the coffee, the espresso machine today installed, so first of the rest of the equipment and pretty much.

823
01:11:01,778 --> 01:11:04,759
People are excited, it's almost fall, it's warm drink season, you know.

824
01:11:04,779 --> 01:11:07,320
Hopefully we can deliver.

825
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:10,301
I'll stop badgering you, counselor saying.

826
01:11:11,933 --> 01:11:15,035
I just wanted to thank you for coming before the council today.

827
01:11:15,055 --> 01:11:17,156
We're so excited for this business.

828
01:11:17,556 --> 01:11:19,657
I think it's something that Medford Square is so missing.

829
01:11:20,018 --> 01:11:24,760
You've been such an amazing patron in Medford and in guiding our development as a city as well.

830
01:11:25,181 --> 01:11:26,221
You're really a team player.

831
01:11:27,262 --> 01:11:30,204
The caffeine addict in me is really excited for this.

832
01:11:30,824 --> 01:11:32,885
So I'm wishing you the best of luck.

833
01:11:33,505 --> 01:11:33,806
Thank you.

834
01:11:33,846 --> 01:11:34,146
Thank you.

835
01:11:34,386 --> 01:11:38,829
It's another piece of the puzzle, I think, in order to make Medford Square

836
01:11:40,505 --> 01:11:42,446
more of a destination, if you want to call it.

837
01:11:43,087 --> 01:11:45,248
That is definitely just another piece.

838
01:11:45,468 --> 01:11:46,929
And then eventually another piece.

839
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:56,754
And then you can create that sort of ecosystem where you can create more of a life in the squares.

840
01:11:56,774 --> 01:11:57,875
Hopefully it happens.

841
01:11:58,415 --> 01:11:59,716
Yeah, slowly but surely.

842
01:12:00,236 --> 01:12:01,237
Putting the puzzle together.

843
01:12:02,878 --> 01:12:03,118
It is.

844
01:12:03,818 --> 01:12:05,599
Certain pieces can help one to the other.

845
01:12:05,639 --> 01:12:07,861
And then all of a sudden, everything blends.

846
01:12:09,366 --> 01:12:09,926
There you have it.

847
01:12:10,086 --> 01:12:12,347
So we just, it's good.

848
01:12:13,267 --> 01:12:14,007
It's good to be here.

849
01:12:14,047 --> 01:12:18,008
You know, it's a third business in the square and then, you know, we, we very excited.

850
01:12:18,048 --> 01:12:21,548
And then the community is really supporting the business, each of them.

851
01:12:21,668 --> 01:12:26,569
So hopefully this one won't be any difference and we'll see.

852
01:12:27,429 --> 01:12:28,329
We're very excited too.

853
01:12:28,349 --> 01:12:29,730
So now we're getting close.

854
01:12:30,110 --> 01:12:32,630
Get my money at breakfast, lunch and dinner.

855
01:12:32,850 --> 01:12:34,390
You can go right after and get a coffee.

856
01:12:34,410 --> 01:12:35,911
And after, yeah.

857
01:12:38,232 --> 01:12:40,774
All right, I'll go to Councilor Lemming.

858
01:12:42,115 --> 01:12:49,582
No, I'd just like to say I'm very, very excited as well to see a coffee shop opening up in Medford Square.

859
01:12:49,662 --> 01:12:56,267
I lived in South Medford for five years and my Oasis Cafe was my go to place.

860
01:12:57,268 --> 01:13:04,974
Now I live pretty near Medford Square, but I don't I don't have like an oasis cafe that I can just waltz over to in the morning.

861
01:13:05,054 --> 01:13:08,237
So are you going to serve pumpkin spice lattes?

862
01:13:08,657 --> 01:13:08,817
Yeah.

863
01:13:08,937 --> 01:13:09,317
In the fall?

864
01:13:09,357 --> 01:13:09,638
You are?

865
01:13:09,878 --> 01:13:10,498
Yeah.

866
01:13:10,538 --> 01:13:11,419
Yeah.

867
01:13:11,499 --> 01:13:11,619
OK.

868
01:13:11,959 --> 01:13:12,740
What kinds of pastries?

869
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:13,721
No, no, I'm kidding.

870
01:13:14,081 --> 01:13:15,042
I think you will.

871
01:13:15,062 --> 01:13:16,163
When it's open, you see them.

872
01:13:16,263 --> 01:13:16,923
It's going to be OK.

873
01:13:17,183 --> 01:13:17,584
Very good.

874
01:13:17,624 --> 01:13:17,784
Yeah.

875
01:13:17,904 --> 01:13:18,104
All right.

876
01:13:18,224 --> 01:13:18,464
All right.

877
01:13:18,524 --> 01:13:20,246
That sounds solid.

878
01:13:20,266 --> 01:13:20,846
Sounds solid.

879
01:13:20,966 --> 01:13:21,327
Thank you.

880
01:13:21,347 --> 01:13:22,788
Thank you very much for coming out tonight.

881
01:13:22,808 --> 01:13:22,928
Thanks.

882
01:13:24,566 --> 01:13:26,709
It's our duty to try to get every secret we can.

883
01:13:26,729 --> 01:13:28,832
All right.

884
01:13:30,374 --> 01:13:33,979
On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, unless Sal, do you wanna?

885
01:13:34,881 --> 01:13:36,463
I'll recognize the economic development director.

886
01:13:40,035 --> 01:13:41,916
Great, thank you, Mr. President.

887
01:13:42,396 --> 01:13:47,979
I just wanted to say that Alvaro is a great member of our business community.

888
01:13:47,999 --> 01:13:51,681
I hope we can support his request.

889
01:13:52,562 --> 01:13:57,785
And I'm another one that was badgering him since my first day at work of when he was gonna open.

890
01:13:57,865 --> 01:13:59,806
So I'm very excited.

891
01:14:00,246 --> 01:14:06,570
And I think if anybody has looked at what he's done in his other businesses,

892
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:15,468
They know that he's invested a lot in the community, does a very good job and excited to see him open.

893
01:14:15,508 --> 01:14:17,030
So thank you for your consideration.

894
01:14:18,051 --> 01:14:18,371
Thank you.

895
01:14:19,513 --> 01:14:20,173
Thank you very much.

896
01:14:21,255 --> 01:14:21,915
Councilor Zara.

897
01:14:23,417 --> 01:14:26,040
This is very lighthearted, but my husband said this morning,

898
01:14:27,058 --> 01:14:28,439
Welcome to the city of Tenoch.

899
01:14:28,499 --> 01:14:29,319
We have a Medford.

900
01:14:29,339 --> 01:14:34,021
I thought that was very charming.

901
01:14:34,141 --> 01:14:37,402
We're very excited in my household for this next endeavor.

902
01:14:37,523 --> 01:14:38,183
So thank you.

903
01:14:39,143 --> 01:14:39,543
Thank you.

904
01:14:40,024 --> 01:14:40,244
Great.

905
01:14:40,444 --> 01:14:45,486
On the motion of Councilor Scarpa to approve, seconded by, seconded by Councilor Sang.

906
01:14:45,606 --> 01:14:46,626
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

907
01:14:49,268 --> 01:14:54,550
Councilor Callahan, Vice President Collins, Councilor Zaro,

908
01:14:55,922 --> 01:15:01,887
Councilor Lennon, Councilor Scapelli, Councilor Hussain, President Behrs.

909
01:15:01,987 --> 01:15:04,168
Yes, I have the affirmative, none the negative, the motion passes.

910
01:15:04,709 --> 01:15:05,109
Good luck.

911
01:15:05,609 --> 01:15:08,031
Thank you, I hope see you all in that place.

912
01:15:08,332 --> 01:15:10,153
I was at Tacuba on the first day, so.

913
01:15:10,713 --> 01:15:15,057
I know, it's going well, so thanks for supporting the businesses.

914
01:15:15,297 --> 01:15:16,558
Thank you very much, good luck.

915
01:15:17,906 --> 01:15:22,528
All right, 25-133, petition for a common ventures license, Inspire Cafe.

916
01:15:22,548 --> 01:15:26,330
Do we have Inspire Cafe with us, either in person or on Zoom?

917
01:15:26,350 --> 01:15:35,615
I'm not seeing them here in person, I'm not seeing a hand on Zoom.

918
01:15:36,335 --> 01:15:38,076
Councilor Scarpelli, have you had a chance to review this?

919
01:15:38,116 --> 01:15:39,017
I know this is for...

920
01:15:52,576 --> 01:15:54,317
Oh, George, I forgot to unmute you.

921
01:15:54,337 --> 01:15:54,777
I'm sorry.

922
01:15:54,998 --> 01:15:55,398
I'm sorry.

923
01:15:57,919 --> 01:16:01,741
No, thank you, Council President because I think that I see everything is in order.

924
01:16:02,201 --> 01:16:10,165
I know the Inspire Cafe as inspirational as it is important to our community and so many people

925
01:16:11,115 --> 01:16:14,839
visit the library just to visit our friends and inspire.

926
01:16:14,879 --> 01:16:32,554
So I would, I know they're not here right now, Council President, but I seldom approve anything without the petitioner here, but I would hate to hold anything back, something, somebody who's tied up for any reason, but because I see everything is in order, Mr. President, so I would move forward with this.

927
01:16:33,375 --> 01:16:33,615
Great.

928
01:16:34,576 --> 01:16:36,618
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

929
01:16:36,718 --> 01:16:37,839
I'll go to Councilor Lemming.

930
01:16:38,911 --> 01:16:42,755
I just like to point out that the the zoom is a little bit weird tonight.

931
01:16:42,795 --> 01:16:44,376
It's apparently requiring a passcode.

932
01:16:44,416 --> 01:16:52,744
So it's possible if the petitioner wanted to appear on zoom that they might not have been able to get in.

933
01:16:52,965 --> 01:17:03,535
So if if anybody wants to try to contact or reach out to the petitioner to see if that could be the issue that could be a

934
01:17:04,499 --> 01:17:05,459
could be worthwhile.

935
01:17:05,479 --> 01:17:11,400
Although that being said, I would cafe in the public library.

936
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:12,221
That sounds fine to me.

937
01:17:12,241 --> 01:17:13,261
I would second the motion.

938
01:17:15,981 --> 01:17:16,262
Great.

939
01:17:16,902 --> 01:17:20,062
Yeah, and we did re send that out.

940
01:17:20,422 --> 01:17:25,924
I think the link that got posted to the events calendar by the communications department didn't have that on it.

941
01:17:26,304 --> 01:17:27,344
So that might be the issue.

942
01:17:28,664 --> 01:17:36,626
If you are hearing from people directly, you know, the link on the city council's meeting portal is functioning as normal.

943
01:17:40,948 --> 01:17:43,689
On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to approve, seconded by Councilor Lemming.

944
01:17:43,709 --> 01:17:44,849
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

945
01:17:47,050 --> 01:17:47,930
Councilor Kellyanne.

946
01:17:48,910 --> 01:17:49,890
Vice President Collins.

947
01:17:50,951 --> 01:17:51,751
Councilor Lazaro.

948
01:17:52,691 --> 01:17:53,351
Councilor Lemming.

949
01:17:54,432 --> 01:17:55,292
Councilor Scarpelli.

950
01:17:56,212 --> 01:17:56,893
Councilor Hussain.

951
01:17:57,773 --> 01:17:58,313
President Beers.

952
01:17:58,907 --> 01:18:03,429
Yes, seven in the affirmative, none in the negative, the motion passes.

953
01:18:03,449 --> 01:18:06,190
25.134, petition for a common victor's license for sidebar.

954
01:18:06,210 --> 01:18:07,151
Do we have?

955
01:18:07,191 --> 01:18:07,851
Yes, we do.

956
01:18:08,011 --> 01:18:08,611
Wonderful.

957
01:18:12,053 --> 01:18:13,333
We knew there was one outstanding thing.

958
01:18:13,373 --> 01:18:15,074
We heard it got addressed.

959
01:18:15,782 --> 01:18:16,062
Yes.

960
01:18:16,282 --> 01:18:20,464
So I'll recognize you to tell us a little bit more about your business and then we'll go to Councilor Scarpelli.

961
01:18:20,685 --> 01:18:24,527
I'm Jenny McPherson, sidebar 97 Locust Street, Medford.

962
01:18:24,887 --> 01:18:28,549
I am looking to open the concession stand at La Conte Ice Rink.

963
01:18:30,710 --> 01:18:32,170
I'm nervous now that I'm up here.

964
01:18:32,211 --> 01:18:32,631
I'm sorry.

965
01:18:34,311 --> 01:18:38,272
I am hoping to provide classy concessions.

966
01:18:38,632 --> 01:18:46,074
I'm very excited also for Localito, don't get me wrong, but I'm hoping that you will come and see me over at La Conte for a cup of coffee as well.

967
01:18:47,474 --> 01:18:56,717
Some of your typical popcorn, hot dog, pretzel for game nights, but I'm also looking to do some healthy grab and go options, breakfast sandwiches.

968
01:18:58,517 --> 01:18:59,417
and good coffee.

969
01:18:59,857 --> 01:19:05,339
I'm a hockey parent, and I would love to have a good cup of coffee while I'm at the rink.

970
01:19:06,839 --> 01:19:08,180
I've been working with Medford Rec.

971
01:19:09,020 --> 01:19:09,740
They've been amazing.

972
01:19:09,780 --> 01:19:15,902
Kevin Bailey has been amazing, and I'm looking forward to working with all the other organizations that use the facility as well.

973
01:19:18,182 --> 01:19:18,462
Great.

974
01:19:18,963 --> 01:19:19,563
Thank you so much.

975
01:19:19,663 --> 01:19:20,383
Councilor Scarpelli.

976
01:19:21,447 --> 01:19:22,789
Thank you, Mr. President.

977
01:19:22,950 --> 01:19:28,578
I know there was one hiccup, and I'm so happy to hear this morning that it was corrected.

978
01:19:28,598 --> 01:19:36,910
And I know in my full-time position, I know how important that

979
01:19:38,304 --> 01:19:40,726
that position that you hold is for the families in Medford.

980
01:19:40,786 --> 01:19:48,751
I think that a lot of times people are running from one area to the other, and probably their only mail sometimes is just that at the concession stand.

981
01:19:49,092 --> 01:19:52,054
And to hear that you're having some healthy, healthy choices is very important.

982
01:19:52,094 --> 01:19:58,859
So I know that some most ranks now just they've reverted to candy machines and

983
01:19:59,709 --> 01:20:11,974
pre-made sandwiches, which is pretty sad, but I appreciate you taking the opportunity and the challenge to work out of our rank and hopefully you'll see us there as well.

984
01:20:12,035 --> 01:20:16,517
So I would, I see everything is in order now, Mr. President, I move approval.

985
01:20:21,819 --> 01:20:24,160
Great, I will go to Councilor Zara.

986
01:20:25,713 --> 01:20:26,515
Thank you for being here.

987
01:20:28,118 --> 01:20:37,175
The Miss McPherson had some issues with some of the paperwork, there was a communication breakdown.

988
01:20:38,443 --> 01:20:40,744
between city departments also.

989
01:20:40,764 --> 01:21:01,913
Um, and I just wanted to mention that one of the projects I think we as the city of Medford can continue to improve on is making it clear for people who are trying to open businesses what the smoothest way to get paperwork in order is and that

990
01:21:02,354 --> 01:21:10,536
We have an economic development director, Sal Giuseppino, who can help sort of walk people through stuff people don't necessarily know.

991
01:21:11,158 --> 01:21:12,839
where he is or how he can do that.

992
01:21:15,261 --> 01:21:20,804
Jenny happens to know me because our kids have been in school and after school together for years.

993
01:21:21,244 --> 01:21:36,814
So when something happened that she didn't know that her fire inspection was not passed because nobody told her and it wasn't passed because the rink didn't have a certificate of being allowed to exist, though it does exist.

994
01:21:38,493 --> 01:21:42,495
And the rink is Medford Rec and the rink is owned by DCR.

995
01:21:42,535 --> 01:21:47,658
These are all pieces of paper that should be easily accessible to everyone.

996
01:21:48,786 --> 01:21:49,907
I don't think, nobody's in trouble.

997
01:21:50,207 --> 01:21:56,350
It just, it was like the fire approval didn't happen because the paperwork wasn't where it was supposed to be.

998
01:21:56,410 --> 01:22:00,493
And then nobody told Jenny that she didn't pass the fire inspection.

999
01:22:00,533 --> 01:22:05,095
And then it, like when she came to get the paperwork, it was not there.

1000
01:22:06,236 --> 01:22:18,043
And then she emailed me, but you shouldn't have to have, you shouldn't have to know me because our kids went to school together to be able to open a business in Medford and not lose money because you can't go to city council and get your paperwork together.

1001
01:22:20,255 --> 01:22:25,965
So I just think that we can find a way to

1002
01:22:27,048 --> 01:22:33,474
make it possible for people who are not connected to, not that you shouldn't be able to open this, this is great.

1003
01:22:34,294 --> 01:22:35,676
This is excellent, I want this to happen.

1004
01:22:37,457 --> 01:22:42,942
We should find a way to make sure that everybody who wants to open a business in Medford can do that with a streamlined process.

1005
01:22:43,342 --> 01:22:51,790
And I look forward to, I've talked with Sal about this, I look forward to working with him and helping everybody be able to do this kind of thing in a smoother way, in a simpler way.

1006
01:22:52,751 --> 01:23:05,049
We've had a lot of great businesses come before us tonight, and this is like a wonderful reflection of all the people that want to open businesses in Medford we want people to come into Medford with their businesses with their

1007
01:23:06,428 --> 01:23:10,610
people's money that we then turn into services for our residents that we need more of.

1008
01:23:11,050 --> 01:23:13,492
So I'm really excited for this.

1009
01:23:13,972 --> 01:23:23,317
I'm excited for the people that are hockey parents, which I'm not one because I told my kids they can't play because there's too many pads and there wasn't any coffee before, but now maybe.

1010
01:23:24,918 --> 01:23:26,118
So thank you so much again.

1011
01:23:26,138 --> 01:23:34,523
I think that we will be able to improve the process for the future and I'm glad that we got it sorted out, but it can be better.

1012
01:23:35,588 --> 01:23:37,448
Thank you, again, thanks for bearing with everything.

1013
01:23:39,109 --> 01:23:39,409
Thanks.

1014
01:23:40,669 --> 01:23:46,610
So I believe we have a motion to approve by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Lemming.

1015
01:23:48,330 --> 01:23:50,291
Seeing no further questions, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1016
01:23:51,651 --> 01:23:52,571
Councilor Callahan.

1017
01:23:53,951 --> 01:23:54,872
Vice President Collins.

1018
01:23:55,932 --> 01:23:56,732
Councilor Lazaro.

1019
01:23:57,672 --> 01:23:58,352
Councilor Lemming.

1020
01:23:59,332 --> 01:24:00,233
Councilor Scarpelli.

1021
01:24:01,233 --> 01:24:01,873
Councilor Singh.

1022
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:03,680
President Beers.

1023
01:24:03,700 --> 01:24:05,761
Yes, I have the affirmative, none the negative, the motion passes.

1024
01:24:05,841 --> 01:24:06,381
Good luck.

1025
01:24:06,461 --> 01:24:07,041
Thank you.

1026
01:24:07,061 --> 01:24:08,222
And have a good hockey season.

1027
01:24:08,302 --> 01:24:09,282
Thank you very much.

1028
01:24:09,702 --> 01:24:12,023
I'm gonna go to Councilor Collins.

1029
01:24:14,324 --> 01:24:20,305
President Beers, I would motion to suspend the rules to take 25-141 and 25-142 out of order.

1030
01:24:20,846 --> 01:24:23,066
On the motion to take papers 25-141 and 25-142.

1031
01:24:23,106 --> 01:24:24,807
Seconded by?

1032
01:24:26,127 --> 01:24:26,767
Seconded.

1033
01:24:27,548 --> 01:24:28,568
Seconded by Councilor Lemming.

1034
01:24:28,608 --> 01:24:29,228
All those in favor?

1035
01:24:29,828 --> 01:24:30,269
Opposed?

1036
01:24:30,349 --> 01:24:31,429
Motion passes.

1037
01:24:33,225 --> 01:24:34,206
One second here.

1038
01:24:46,673 --> 01:24:54,137
Paper 25141, Medford Affordable Housing Trust Fund Appointment, Teda DeRosa.

1039
01:24:55,038 --> 01:24:55,678
Dear Ms.

1040
01:24:55,718 --> 01:25:00,361
President, members of Medford City Council, recommendation of the Medford Affordable Housing Trust Fund Board of Trustees,

1041
01:25:01,149 --> 01:25:07,351
I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve the following candidates to serve on the Board of Trustees for the Medford Affordable Housing Trust Funds.

1042
01:25:07,872 --> 01:25:09,012
Sincerely, Mayor Brantling O'Kirk.

1043
01:25:09,432 --> 01:25:09,732
Hi guys.

1044
01:25:10,473 --> 01:25:11,733
Hi.

1045
01:25:11,913 --> 01:25:16,915
So if you want to introduce and talk about why you want to be on the board and then we'll take a vote.

1046
01:25:17,448 --> 01:25:19,649
Yeah, I'll just briefly introduce Teta.

1047
01:25:19,850 --> 01:25:21,090
My name is Catherine Buckingham.

1048
01:25:21,130 --> 01:25:22,091
I'm the housing planner.

1049
01:25:22,611 --> 01:25:28,255
I'm excited to have Teta DeRosa here today, the mayor's appointee for the Affordable Housing Trust.

1050
01:25:28,995 --> 01:25:33,298
As Teta can explain in more detail, she grew up in Medford.

1051
01:25:33,418 --> 01:25:38,842
She cares deeply about affordable housing and equity, and I think she would make an excellent addition to our board.

1052
01:25:39,262 --> 01:25:40,683
So Teta, if you'd like to speak more.

1053
01:25:41,242 --> 01:25:42,022
Hi, how are you?

1054
01:25:42,763 --> 01:25:43,784
I'm Teta DeRosa.

1055
01:25:44,264 --> 01:25:46,025
I grew up in Medford.

1056
01:25:47,506 --> 01:25:53,049
My family's been here since the early 50s and graduated from Medford High.

1057
01:25:53,769 --> 01:26:05,776
And so I'm back here for the long haul and I am a real estate agent and I've also been a recipient of affordable housing in my younger years.

1058
01:26:06,377 --> 01:26:08,238
So I know the benefits of it.

1059
01:26:09,332 --> 01:26:13,958
So I when I seen the post that there was a vacancy.

1060
01:26:14,438 --> 01:26:20,866
I immediately applied, because I think with my experience as a real estate agent, and formerly working with

1061
01:26:22,286 --> 01:26:37,236
a development company in Boston, where we did affordable housing, we were responsible for leasing up some affordable home ownership, as well as affordable rentals, I do have some experience in that area.

1062
01:26:37,376 --> 01:26:46,703
So, you know, knowing that I could be part of, you know, Medford's growth in affordable housing, that'd be great.

1063
01:26:48,891 --> 01:26:49,151
great.

1064
01:26:49,651 --> 01:26:50,352
Thank you so much.

1065
01:26:50,452 --> 01:26:53,334
Congratulations on being recommended for appointment.

1066
01:26:53,594 --> 01:26:53,974
Thank you.

1067
01:26:55,015 --> 01:26:58,457
I don't see any issues, but, you know, I'm just one of the seven.

1068
01:26:59,177 --> 01:27:01,058
I'll go to Council Lazzaro and then Councilor Lemme.

1069
01:27:01,859 --> 01:27:02,319
Thank you.

1070
01:27:02,819 --> 01:27:10,084
I think it's so critical that we have somebody interested in serving on the board with lived experience.

1071
01:27:10,124 --> 01:27:11,905
I think that's really important.

1072
01:27:11,985 --> 01:27:18,369
So I would motion to approve and thank you so much for being willing to do this work for us.

1073
01:27:19,718 --> 01:27:22,319
Great, on the motion approved by Councilor Lazaro, seconded by?

1074
01:27:22,339 --> 01:27:24,160
Seconded by Councilor Sang.

1075
01:27:24,180 --> 01:27:25,060
We'll go to Councilor Lemming.

1076
01:27:26,621 --> 01:27:33,004
I'd just like to thank you for applying for this role and congratulate you on being recommended for appointment.

1077
01:27:33,084 --> 01:27:36,966
Thank you for coming to a city council meeting.

1078
01:27:37,066 --> 01:27:43,909
I remember when I was first appointed to a board here, I had to sit here until something like 1am.

1079
01:27:44,109 --> 01:27:45,010
It was budget night.

1080
01:27:45,930 --> 01:27:46,350
I remember.

1081
01:27:48,162 --> 01:27:49,682
Yeah, I remember, I remember.

1082
01:27:49,962 --> 01:28:03,025
And, you know, I had to sit there cause sat through the whole thing, but I'm glad that we can get y'all, you and the next appointment to the CPC out of the way pretty quickly.

1083
01:28:03,385 --> 01:28:09,406
And just wish you luck on your service to the Affordable Housing Trust.

1084
01:28:09,686 --> 01:28:10,727
And I look forward to working with you.

1085
01:28:10,807 --> 01:28:11,107
Thank you.

1086
01:28:11,367 --> 01:28:11,747
Thank you.

1087
01:28:12,207 --> 01:28:12,407
Great.

1088
01:28:13,027 --> 01:28:16,608
On the motion by, who did I say it was by?

1089
01:28:17,367 --> 01:28:19,853
Council is our seconded by Councillor Singh.

1090
01:28:19,893 --> 01:28:20,775
All those in favor?

1091
01:28:21,416 --> 01:28:21,917
Opposed?

1092
01:28:21,998 --> 01:28:22,799
Motion passes.

1093
01:28:22,819 --> 01:28:23,601
Thank you.

1094
01:28:23,862 --> 01:28:24,483
Congratulations.

1095
01:28:24,904 --> 01:28:25,325
Thank you.

1096
01:28:25,365 --> 01:28:26,428
Thank you for your service to our city.

1097
01:28:29,197 --> 01:28:44,921
25142, submitted by Mayor Brianna Lago-Kern, Medford Community Preservation Committee appointment, Myisha Majumder, dear President Ferris and members of the Medford City Council, I respectfully request to recommend that your honorable body confirm the appointment of Myisha Majumder of Medford to the Community Preservation Committee for a term to expire September 10th, 2026.

1098
01:28:45,741 --> 01:28:47,381
Myisha will be present during the meeting.

1099
01:28:47,441 --> 01:28:49,022
Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.

1100
01:28:49,422 --> 01:28:50,902
Sincerely, Brianna Lago-Kern, Mayor.

1101
01:28:51,802 --> 01:28:53,823
Myisha, I see you on Zoom, so I'll unmute you.

1102
01:28:55,552 --> 01:28:57,813
Congratulations on your recommendation for appointment.

1103
01:28:57,933 --> 01:29:03,835
If you want to tell us a little bit about why you want to serve on the CPC and then we will go from there.

1104
01:29:03,855 --> 01:29:05,095
Sure.

1105
01:29:05,616 --> 01:29:07,756
I've had the honor of serving on the CPC the last year.

1106
01:29:07,776 --> 01:29:15,759
I've really enjoyed my time looking to stay on, getting in right under the wire with my term expiring tomorrow.

1107
01:29:15,859 --> 01:29:17,180
So hopefully I'm approved.

1108
01:29:18,020 --> 01:29:19,261
Happy answering your questions as well.

1109
01:29:22,262 --> 01:29:22,442
Great.

1110
01:29:23,982 --> 01:29:25,103
Do we have any questions?

1111
01:29:26,664 --> 01:29:30,666
Is there a motion on the motion to approve by Councilor Callahan?

1112
01:29:30,706 --> 01:29:33,307
Seconded by Councilor Sang.

1113
01:29:33,347 --> 01:29:34,128
All those in favor?

1114
01:29:35,008 --> 01:29:35,529
Opposed?

1115
01:29:35,749 --> 01:29:36,409
Motion passes.

1116
01:29:36,469 --> 01:29:38,830
Congratulations and thank you so much for your service to the city.

1117
01:29:39,411 --> 01:29:39,871
Thank you.

1118
01:29:42,533 --> 01:29:43,813
Councilor Scarpelli.

1119
01:29:44,554 --> 01:29:47,956
I know that we have our leadership team from the police department.

1120
01:29:48,216 --> 01:29:50,157
I'm trying to find the resolution that

1121
01:29:50,678 --> 01:29:57,019
I think they're here on 25 140 capital stabilization and water and capital stabilization appropriation requests.

1122
01:29:57,179 --> 01:30:00,660
Can we hear that please if we if that's yes.

1123
01:30:01,820 --> 01:30:08,382
The motion of Councilor Scarpelli to take 25 140 seconded by Councilor saying all those in favor.

1124
01:30:08,882 --> 01:30:10,302
Opposed motion passes.

1125
01:30:10,322 --> 01:30:10,302
25 140.

1126
01:30:15,255 --> 01:30:21,380
It's a bit of my bare brain legal current capital stabilization fund water and sewer capital stabilization fund appropriation requests.

1127
01:30:23,421 --> 01:30:34,110
Dear president bears and city councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approves the appropriations of one capital stabilization fund and the amount of $2,346,101 and zero cents on the following items DPW $357,287 for a four wheel drive dump truck and sender with plow.

1128
01:30:43,313 --> 01:30:55,256
$300,000 for design development of the seven-acre lawn cemetery expansion, $200,000 for stump removal, $180,000 for removal of displaced grave soil, $154,592 for a fleet tow truck, $100,158 for a three-quarter ton pickup truck with lift gate, $94,055 for a dump truck, $60,000 for field refurbishment, and $32,000 for a leaf vacuum and leaf box for a dump truck.

1129
01:31:09,176 --> 01:31:10,517
I'm going to pause the reading there.

1130
01:31:10,677 --> 01:31:11,458
We'll take them in order.

1131
01:31:11,478 --> 01:31:18,824
We'll do DPW facilities, fire, general, police, and then we'll come back to water and sewer.

1132
01:31:19,524 --> 01:31:22,487
So let's start with the DPW.

1133
01:31:25,549 --> 01:31:26,470
Good evening, everybody.

1134
01:31:26,510 --> 01:31:27,010
Tim McGiven.

1135
01:31:27,031 --> 01:31:29,432
We have our fleet director here as well.

1136
01:31:30,013 --> 01:31:30,153
Yep.

1137
01:31:30,213 --> 01:31:33,536
And fleet superintendent, Michael Wenzel.

1138
01:31:35,759 --> 01:31:37,721
So it's pretty straightforward.

1139
01:31:37,741 --> 01:31:39,483
There's a lot of things on here.

1140
01:31:39,603 --> 01:31:42,066
So, you know, we can probably just go to questions.

1141
01:31:42,106 --> 01:31:43,107
A lot of this stuff is routine.

1142
01:31:44,909 --> 01:31:46,430
Except for a few notable things.

1143
01:31:47,491 --> 01:31:54,038
The seven acre lawn cemetery expansion that's a design development project basically to take that from

1144
01:31:54,807 --> 01:32:00,554
a conceptual cost estimate to a design that we would then have to figure out a way to fund.

1145
01:32:01,375 --> 01:32:02,977
So that's pretty interesting.

1146
01:32:03,077 --> 01:32:04,158
Happy to take questions on that.

1147
01:32:04,538 --> 01:32:07,562
And if folks want to see more, I have a presentation as well.

1148
01:32:08,063 --> 01:32:09,744
But it's up to you folks on that.

1149
01:32:10,585 --> 01:32:12,526
Stump removal, pretty, pretty basic.

1150
01:32:12,546 --> 01:32:15,147
We're going to try to remove another 40 or 50 stumps.

1151
01:32:16,227 --> 01:32:17,967
So that's pretty straightforward.

1152
01:32:18,528 --> 01:32:19,688
The displaced grave soil.

1153
01:32:20,808 --> 01:32:24,430
As you know, we did more than this last year in this

1154
01:32:26,471 --> 01:32:28,513
This should be basically it.

1155
01:32:28,553 --> 01:32:31,416
This will be enough to clear that lawn.

1156
01:32:32,156 --> 01:32:37,842
I call it lawn 13 for development into burial space.

1157
01:32:38,663 --> 01:32:41,365
And then I'll note the fleet tow truck too that Mike can talk more about.

1158
01:32:41,705 --> 01:32:44,108
That's a tool that we believe we need for the city.

1159
01:32:44,948 --> 01:32:46,090
And he can tell you more about that.

1160
01:32:46,827 --> 01:32:52,888
The field reimbursement, we're looking at field two at Tufts Park.

1161
01:32:52,928 --> 01:32:53,949
It's a softball field.

1162
01:32:54,669 --> 01:32:56,349
We've done a lot of work on baseball fields.

1163
01:32:56,569 --> 01:33:00,630
We've done some work on the outsides of softball fields, for example.

1164
01:33:01,150 --> 01:33:02,191
Hickey got some improvements.

1165
01:33:02,811 --> 01:33:04,651
So we want to try to refurbish one field.

1166
01:33:06,051 --> 01:33:06,692
And let's see.

1167
01:33:07,532 --> 01:33:08,612
Anyway, those are the notable things.

1168
01:33:08,772 --> 01:33:10,152
Everything else is pretty routine.

1169
01:33:10,573 --> 01:33:12,093
And we have Mike here for questions as well.

1170
01:33:14,451 --> 01:33:16,973
Do we have any questions on the DPW items in front of us?

1171
01:33:17,893 --> 01:33:18,734
Councilor Callahan.

1172
01:33:20,435 --> 01:33:25,519
I'm just curious, how many stump removals do we normally do, like within our budget per year?

1173
01:33:26,319 --> 01:33:27,620
Let's see, it depends.

1174
01:33:28,241 --> 01:33:33,484
For this type, which includes sidewalk, for this amount of money, we'll probably get about 45, maybe 50 stumps.

1175
01:33:35,439 --> 01:33:37,441
maybe a little bit less, depending on the market.

1176
01:33:37,781 --> 01:33:38,021
Sure.

1177
01:33:38,041 --> 01:33:39,502
No, I understood that you said it was being 40 and 50.

1178
01:33:39,542 --> 01:33:47,848
But like, yeah, when we normally not asking for capital funds, like within our normal budget, like how many do we normally?

1179
01:33:47,868 --> 01:33:51,751
However many trees we take down, because we take down the stump too.

1180
01:33:51,811 --> 01:33:54,073
And then we do additional, I don't have the number.

1181
01:33:55,085 --> 01:33:57,549
on hand, but I can tell you what it is later on.

1182
01:33:57,849 --> 01:34:05,260
Okay, but my follow up question is about when these stumps are removed, and these are, I assume sidewalk trees?

1183
01:34:05,861 --> 01:34:06,161
Correct.

1184
01:34:06,181 --> 01:34:06,762
Predominantly?

1185
01:34:06,962 --> 01:34:07,303
Correct.

1186
01:34:07,503 --> 01:34:08,084
Great.

1187
01:34:08,244 --> 01:34:09,866
Will the tree pits be left open?

1188
01:34:10,990 --> 01:34:14,813
Some of them, yes, they will remain, or we'll put them back is a better way to put it.

1189
01:34:15,133 --> 01:34:19,456
We have new standards now for tree pits, so if it doesn't fit our new standards, we won't put it back.

1190
01:34:20,256 --> 01:34:27,241
It just doesn't make any sense, usually, and the reason that the tree is dead to begin with is usually because the tree pit was done wrong.

1191
01:34:28,041 --> 01:34:31,344
Great, but those tree pits are not gonna be filled over with cement as part of this?

1192
01:34:32,404 --> 01:34:34,926
They may very well be, so for example- If there's the two small ones.

1193
01:34:35,066 --> 01:34:38,088
Correct, if we do not wanna put a tree there again in the future.

1194
01:34:38,981 --> 01:34:44,864
we will either, it'll be concrete, asphalt, or brick, although I don't think we have any brick in this particular contract.

1195
01:34:45,924 --> 01:35:03,832
And if I may ask, these places where there were trees, where there is now a planned non-replacement of the tree, that stuff is all gonna be in the final, the big, I'm missing the term, the tree, not the inventory, but the tree master plan that we're developing?

1196
01:35:04,550 --> 01:35:06,853
Yes, so in a general sense for sure.

1197
01:35:06,873 --> 01:35:20,947
I don't think it gets drills down to the specifics on recommendations for a specific site, but they're going to be recommendations on how we plant streets, you know spacing between trees different canopy types and sizes.

1198
01:35:21,768 --> 01:35:22,689
species, all that.

1199
01:35:23,230 --> 01:35:27,937
Right now we have mostly Norway maples, and they're on their way out.

1200
01:35:28,478 --> 01:35:31,082
And it's kind of lopsided.

1201
01:35:31,142 --> 01:35:35,910
So, you know, we can replace those with more appropriate canopy trees based off of that report.

1202
01:35:37,112 --> 01:35:38,753
Great, tiny follow up question.

1203
01:35:38,813 --> 01:35:49,342
Do you know if the tree report and the master plan will include information about which tree pits are currently too small for us to replace those trees?

1204
01:35:49,362 --> 01:35:55,187
Because it sounds like, am I correct that that's the size of the tree pit is what, like, if it's too small, that's probably why the tree is dead.

1205
01:35:55,307 --> 01:35:57,488
And then let's not keep that tree pit.

1206
01:35:57,889 --> 01:35:58,169
Correct.

1207
01:35:58,369 --> 01:36:02,833
There will be information in that sort of master plan about which of our tree pits are too small?

1208
01:36:03,587 --> 01:36:18,122
Yes, I'm cautious to say how much detail but we have a full inventory now with lots of data and that data is included the tree pit size, whether or not it's in a bird strip or in a two by two hole, things like that.

1209
01:36:18,302 --> 01:36:24,249
So, and also whether or not the roots are bulging out the diameter of the tree to approximate its age.

1210
01:36:25,236 --> 01:36:28,817
species, obviously, all of these things were collected in the inventory.

1211
01:36:29,357 --> 01:36:37,760
So it may not say it in the report specifically what to do about it, but it's used for data to generally guide the master plan for our canopy.

1212
01:36:38,240 --> 01:36:38,861
Thank you so much.

1213
01:36:38,881 --> 01:36:39,241
You're welcome.

1214
01:36:40,521 --> 01:36:41,081
Thank you.

1215
01:36:41,722 --> 01:36:42,222
On that point,

1216
01:36:43,805 --> 01:36:50,490
Are there alternative non-cement, non-concrete, non-asphalt uses that we could use a tree pit for?

1217
01:36:50,970 --> 01:36:56,134
Like, could we put smaller shrub-like plantings or flowers or something that's not a tree?

1218
01:36:56,714 --> 01:36:56,955
Yes.

1219
01:36:57,575 --> 01:36:57,855
Okay.

1220
01:36:58,115 --> 01:36:59,416
And that's going to be part of...

1221
01:37:00,838 --> 01:37:07,562
this master plan for urban forestry because you only have so much space in your street scape.

1222
01:37:08,602 --> 01:37:18,327
And one of the things we're trying to look at is what do smaller and different shaped canopies and trees look like and how do they fit together and how do their root systems interact?

1223
01:37:18,968 --> 01:37:19,848
So that's all part of it.

1224
01:37:20,168 --> 01:37:20,408
Great.

1225
01:37:20,969 --> 01:37:27,252
Now, are we going to pave over the tree pits that no longer fit our sizing and then we'll go back in the future and

1226
01:37:27,883 --> 01:37:29,644
break that again or what are we going to do?

1227
01:37:29,764 --> 01:37:31,485
That could happen, but that's not that big of a deal.

1228
01:37:31,545 --> 01:37:31,805
Yeah.

1229
01:37:31,825 --> 01:37:44,853
So if, say, for example, we have a tree that's getting paved over and now it's concrete sidewalk, if later on we decide that we're going to put a tree in that strip somewhere and we're going to cut a tree pit in, that's not a big deal.

1230
01:37:44,873 --> 01:37:48,496
We'll just cut it in and we'll do it right this time, is what I'm getting at.

1231
01:37:48,936 --> 01:37:49,996
So engineering is even

1232
01:37:51,657 --> 01:37:57,442
I don't know exactly if we've implemented any, but working on tree pit details for projects.

1233
01:37:58,022 --> 01:38:00,084
So as we move forward, we'll get better at it.

1234
01:38:00,724 --> 01:38:06,769
Is there any kind of intermediate solution, like a small garden instead of just going to... Yes.

1235
01:38:07,169 --> 01:38:07,409
Okay.

1236
01:38:07,650 --> 01:38:07,850
Yes.

1237
01:38:07,910 --> 01:38:09,051
I think we're thinking about that.

1238
01:38:09,591 --> 01:38:16,496
And I know that when our tree warden selects species to plant, it's not a mono-species situation she's selecting.

1239
01:38:17,947 --> 01:38:26,672
And now we have actually information that will guide us in what species we're selecting, where we're planting them, and how we're planting them, and how they're spaced apart on the road.

1240
01:38:27,632 --> 01:38:30,014
So that's all gonna be new.

1241
01:38:30,034 --> 01:38:34,416
I mean, we're used to seeing, you know, 30 feet tree, 30 feet tree, but the future is gonna be different.

1242
01:38:34,796 --> 01:38:35,597
We can't do it that way.

1243
01:38:35,617 --> 01:38:36,097
It doesn't work.

1244
01:38:36,117 --> 01:38:37,238
Okay.

1245
01:38:38,098 --> 01:38:38,298
Great.

1246
01:38:38,798 --> 01:38:39,739
I'm gonna go to Councilor Sang.

1247
01:38:39,759 --> 01:38:43,301
And then I have a couple more questions on the cemetery, but I'll come back to Councilor Sang.

1248
01:38:44,291 --> 01:38:46,612
I'll help you be the transition to the cemetery.

1249
01:38:46,692 --> 01:38:59,795
But before that, I think it would be my preference if for the tree pits that seem like they could be good candidates for like filling in the green space that we don't jump to filling them with concrete.

1250
01:38:59,815 --> 01:39:11,879
I know it's not too difficult to go back, but I think for the heat island, if I can just for time and resources, I think, you know more about this than I do, but it'd be my gut instinct to say that.

1251
01:39:12,967 --> 01:39:18,691
we think should be maybe more careful about which ones we put the patch in first.

1252
01:39:18,751 --> 01:39:27,697
I know there's some residents who weren't super happy in Hillside about some of the tree pits that were filled in there.

1253
01:39:28,037 --> 01:39:40,466
My question about the cemetery is that for this expansion project, do you have an estimate of how many more spaces we would get from this acreage?

1254
01:39:40,979 --> 01:39:48,181
Yeah, approximately, it was in the couple of hundreds, 250, 260 additional bots.

1255
01:39:48,641 --> 01:39:57,423
So, you know, and the numbers we're talking about are, you know, another 10 years or so, maybe 15 years of burial space.

1256
01:39:58,103 --> 01:40:03,084
So those are the numbers that we're using in discussions, but we're at the concept phase right now.

1257
01:40:03,645 --> 01:40:07,786
So the, you know, some of the estimates are 300,000 to continue design.

1258
01:40:10,623 --> 01:40:12,024
to get us to construction documents.

1259
01:40:12,344 --> 01:40:22,048
And then it could be like, you know, a few million dollars, three, maybe more, three and a half, to actually develop it and build it out, depending on the scope of work and the size of the project.

1260
01:40:22,088 --> 01:40:26,689
And, you know, efficiencies, maybe we do something with NBELP, for example.

1261
01:40:28,470 --> 01:40:28,830
Thank you.

1262
01:40:30,831 --> 01:40:36,073
Does that estimate, the 10 to 15, include both the removal of the soil, you know, the

1263
01:40:37,257 --> 01:40:47,541
the giant pile of dirt that's next to the lots right now in the back of, and the expansion, or is that just the expansion into the current conservation land?

1264
01:40:47,941 --> 01:40:50,562
So the 300k would just be the seven acre design.

1265
01:40:50,842 --> 01:40:51,222
Okay.

1266
01:40:51,383 --> 01:40:51,803
Yep.

1267
01:40:51,923 --> 01:40:52,163
Right.

1268
01:40:52,423 --> 01:40:57,485
I meant more your 10 to 15 year estimate of lengthening the service on the cemetery.

1269
01:40:58,349 --> 01:41:00,112
That would just be the seven acre expansion.

1270
01:41:00,874 --> 01:41:02,277
Got it.

1271
01:41:02,698 --> 01:41:03,981
Do you have cemetery questions.

1272
01:41:04,963 --> 01:41:05,164
Okay.

1273
01:41:10,012 --> 01:41:12,313
Okay, let's stick with the cemetery and then we'll come to the leaf vacuum.

1274
01:41:12,413 --> 01:41:13,614
It's just like 30 things on here.

1275
01:41:13,634 --> 01:41:14,355
I don't want to jump in.

1276
01:41:14,475 --> 01:41:19,478
I also have a short presentation that I could plug in on my computer if you want.

1277
01:41:19,658 --> 01:41:25,141
It shows the concept plan itself and some of the estimate information, generally speaking the area.

1278
01:41:25,161 --> 01:41:28,043
It's up to you guys though, like I said, how much time you want to spend on it.

1279
01:41:28,763 --> 01:41:33,365
Yeah, I have a couple questions and then maybe we can go to the discussion.

1280
01:41:33,385 --> 01:41:35,606
I also see we have the president of M-BELT here.

1281
01:41:35,626 --> 01:41:39,187
I don't know if just listening or planning to say something.

1282
01:41:40,307 --> 01:41:42,188
Just listening, okay.

1283
01:41:43,368 --> 01:41:44,489
I'm also on the M-BELT board.

1284
01:41:44,869 --> 01:41:46,229
We've talked about this a little bit.

1285
01:41:46,349 --> 01:41:48,810
I've talked with my fellow board members about it.

1286
01:41:49,311 --> 01:41:51,771
I have some concerns about the expansion.

1287
01:41:51,791 --> 01:41:55,633
I guess my main question is if we could just talk about kind of the big picture here.

1288
01:41:56,444 --> 01:42:08,608
Right now, when are we thinking that Oak Grove is going to no longer be able to have new folks buried there, which four to five years is the estimate that we're using right now.

1289
01:42:08,628 --> 01:42:09,349
All right.

1290
01:42:09,629 --> 01:42:15,311
And that includes the if we remove that soil pile is that add some time.

1291
01:42:16,835 --> 01:42:23,460
That doesn't include that, but that's also not a huge lawn, but that will buy us some time.

1292
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:24,140
Okay.

1293
01:42:24,781 --> 01:42:34,468
And then if we were to, and then kind of this project that we're talking about, and maybe if folks have more questions about it, I've reviewed it pretty extensively, so if folks want to look more into it.

1294
01:42:35,148 --> 01:42:53,405
this would be, you know, when the Brooks Estate, when all of that conservation negotiation happened in the 90s, there's essentially some land currently used for like some storage of materials and the stumps, dumping of stumps, that's on what I think most folks going into there would consider

1295
01:42:53,985 --> 01:43:10,591
Kind of on the Brooks estate side of the access drive, but it's cemetery land and has some cemetery use this would be expanding the cemetery into that land so be kind of changing that from more of like the forested more conservation use to more like the cemetery use on the other side of the access drive.

1296
01:43:11,832 --> 01:43:12,752
Is that fair fair.

1297
01:43:14,583 --> 01:43:17,367
The only clarification I would make is that it's not conservation land.

1298
01:43:18,068 --> 01:43:19,430
It is a separate parcel.

1299
01:43:19,450 --> 01:43:23,256
Yeah, so the boundary is pretty clear.

1300
01:43:23,556 --> 01:43:28,724
Yeah, and I'm glad and Doug is nodding his head that correcting me.

1301
01:43:29,485 --> 01:43:34,927
And you know we're really kicking off, this would really be kicking off a design and I think we're taking the collaborative approach.

1302
01:43:35,227 --> 01:43:45,011
We have a concept plan that was used really to create an estimate and to create an idea of massing the site and how much road is it, you know, how many lawns is it, things like that.

1303
01:43:45,631 --> 01:43:49,393
And we do need a service area, we do need a maintenance yard because right now,

1304
01:43:50,091 --> 01:43:51,252
We don't have one.

1305
01:43:51,693 --> 01:43:54,055
And I think that negatively impacts the whole area.

1306
01:43:54,696 --> 01:44:02,544
So I think figuring out the best way to do that on this operational land is part of this project as well.

1307
01:44:03,165 --> 01:44:03,905
Yeah.

1308
01:44:04,045 --> 01:44:06,108
And there are restrictions to this property.

1309
01:44:07,303 --> 01:44:10,385
the buffers, the way that the stones can be laid.

1310
01:44:11,325 --> 01:44:29,173
So it's, and you know, one of the things that we've already talked about with the M-Belt is trying to work with the natural landscape a little bit more and try to retain connectivity with the pedestrian hiking paths that are through the parcel, kind of respecting that piece of it.

1311
01:44:30,574 --> 01:44:32,695
But, you know, it is something that is,

1312
01:44:33,415 --> 01:44:41,238
is that I would say we should try to continue to move forward as a city, just because we have this four to five year timeline.

1313
01:44:41,678 --> 01:44:43,279
And right now everything is just on paper.

1314
01:44:43,619 --> 01:44:54,563
As far as this project goes, it's the phase of figuring out how to get $3.4 million and actually build this thing is a different discussion.

1315
01:44:55,263 --> 01:45:01,465
But this phase of a project is when you really do the due diligence and iron out design and really understand

1316
01:45:02,193 --> 01:45:04,975
what it means and how to move it forward.

1317
01:45:07,577 --> 01:45:08,377
I appreciate that.

1318
01:45:08,397 --> 01:45:11,860
Yeah, I think along those lines, you know, I have some

1319
01:45:13,065 --> 01:45:21,232
I appreciate what you know the collaborative approach and trying to adjust the design I think that's really important, I think, maybe even going further down the road and figure out how we can align.

1320
01:45:22,373 --> 01:45:28,879
You know some of the funding that and belt has received the works of state land trust has received for the access drive.

1321
01:45:29,920 --> 01:45:33,683
I think maybe turning this into a more collaborative project overall for the whole area.

1322
01:45:34,274 --> 01:45:36,455
might be the way to go down the road here.

1323
01:45:36,475 --> 01:45:51,441
Because I personally, you know, the concept design and where we've been at so far, you know, I personally have some concerns, you know, as a counselor, as someone who just uses the area, as a Berks estate board member about the concept.

1324
01:45:52,381 --> 01:45:55,922
It sounds like we're already talking about making some changes as we move through the design phase.

1325
01:45:57,083 --> 01:46:07,947
But I think there are some real questions to be raised about, you know, if we're extending the life of the cemetery not very long, but making permanent changes to, you know, some of the

1326
01:46:09,069 --> 01:46:14,094
one of the largest, certainly the largest city-owned green space, you know, in the city.

1327
01:46:14,114 --> 01:46:16,476
How do we balance that?

1328
01:46:16,956 --> 01:46:29,348
And if we can do it in a way that really enhances that space and makes it more accessible, you know, for both the Brooks Estate Land Trust and for the cemetery, you know, maybe there's a maintenance, maybe we do the maintenance yard and shed and

1329
01:46:30,929 --> 01:46:35,352
But we can do that in a way where, you know, that can help with the new access drive.

1330
01:46:35,912 --> 01:46:38,974
Those kinds of things, I think, are considerations that I would want to take into account.

1331
01:46:39,094 --> 01:46:51,182
And I guess, saying all that, my question is, you know, do you think that those considerations and those collaborative conversations are something we're going to be able to incorporate in the design process that will be funded through this appropriation?

1332
01:46:52,335 --> 01:47:03,582
Yes, I think as long as all the interests are met, as far as why, why we're doing the project and of course yeah, there's no buildings really involved with this project, it's a landscape project.

1333
01:47:04,102 --> 01:47:10,326
So, you know, it's grading some pavement, some preserving large trees.

1334
01:47:11,847 --> 01:47:38,155
it's doing it doing it the right way and I will say that those questions that you have are really good questions and you should be asking those questions and I think the way the best way to get the answer to those questions is to continue down the design process and the collaboration process with our neighbors and see if there are some efficiencies with you know joining projects and looking at it more holistically I get that I would just keep in mind you know the

1335
01:47:39,112 --> 01:47:43,854
these things tend to get drawn out if you continue to do that and pile on.

1336
01:47:44,795 --> 01:47:48,897
But I think this is a situation where we can define this project pretty well.

1337
01:47:48,917 --> 01:48:04,965
It's the road, it's some improvements up at the site, maybe some improvements to the conservation land, clean up work or whatever, and making some operational space for us because I think that was identified as an operational need for the city back when this fight was had.

1338
01:48:04,985 --> 01:48:05,665
Yeah.

1339
01:48:06,447 --> 01:48:06,607
Yeah.

1340
01:48:06,627 --> 01:48:07,808
And I, and I appreciate that.

1341
01:48:08,148 --> 01:48:15,813
And I think more just what I'm saying is since we're starting the conversation tonight, this is kind of the, the first, the first appropriation on the design.

1342
01:48:15,873 --> 01:48:19,175
Like I want to have the full scope of the conversation in front of us.

1343
01:48:20,356 --> 01:48:33,284
You know, who knows if I'll be, be around for those conversations here or not, but I, you know, I would have a very hard time voting for an appropriation of three or $4 million for something that looks a lot like the concept that came out.

1344
01:48:33,844 --> 01:48:34,625
I'd have a much,

1345
01:48:35,225 --> 01:48:36,711
I think, and I think a lot of folks have a much.

1346
01:48:37,500 --> 01:48:56,224
you know, I think it would be a better project and a better proposal if we were able to incorporate more of multiple uses, not just that this is not just a cemetery expansion, but this is about what does that part of the city, that city-owned land, whether it's M-Belt or the cemetery land, look like for the long-term future?

1347
01:48:56,244 --> 01:48:57,745
Because it's a really significant investment.

1348
01:48:57,765 --> 01:49:05,847
And I think if we're saying, well, it's $3.5 million to keep the cemetery going for eight or 10 more years, that's an argument, but we have a lot of competing interests for city resources.

1349
01:49:05,907 --> 01:49:07,027
Maybe that's not an argument that

1350
01:49:07,847 --> 01:49:08,387
wins the day.

1351
01:49:08,407 --> 01:49:23,013
If it's we're going to spend five or $6 million to keep the cemetery going and keep, you know, really enhance access to this, you know, 50 acres of open space for the next 200 years, you know, that's a different kind of benefit, I think.

1352
01:49:23,153 --> 01:49:25,373
So just want to have that framing around it.

1353
01:49:26,034 --> 01:49:26,534
Absolutely.

1354
01:49:26,574 --> 01:49:26,734
Yeah.

1355
01:49:27,054 --> 01:49:32,220
Yeah, and I would just also say that there are other opportunities for collaboration with the Oak Grove Cemetery.

1356
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:35,603
I think it's an incredibly valuable asset that this city has.

1357
01:49:35,843 --> 01:49:36,284
Yeah.

1358
01:49:36,544 --> 01:49:38,887
There are rules associated with cemetery land.

1359
01:49:39,187 --> 01:49:43,972
So we would have to, you know, maintain those rules, obviously, when it comes to access and hours and things like that.

1360
01:49:44,613 --> 01:49:47,676
But I think, you know, those could be respected in a collaborative process.

1361
01:49:48,877 --> 01:49:59,522
And there's work in the historic part that needs to happen if anybody has been up there recently, we're trying to get the roads fixed up there, which is another large project.

1362
01:49:59,622 --> 01:50:07,085
And then, you know, we're looking at two buildings that are falling apart that are historic that we need to preserve.

1363
01:50:07,926 --> 01:50:10,627
And I believe you know there's some public obligation there to do that.

1364
01:50:11,407 --> 01:50:20,515
So, you know, it's a property that I'm trying to give as much attention as I can, because I know it hasn't received a ton of attention over over the decades.

1365
01:50:21,376 --> 01:50:29,143
So, and this is a part of it, you know, and I know that agreement and that argument was had back in the 90s, and then it's kind of just sat on the shelf.

1366
01:50:29,567 --> 01:50:34,209
And now we're kind of at hour 11, it's 1158 in the cemetery world.

1367
01:50:34,609 --> 01:50:35,509
What are we doing folks?

1368
01:50:36,389 --> 01:50:38,910
So anyway, that's how I see it.

1369
01:50:39,530 --> 01:50:41,271
But like your points are good.

1370
01:50:41,391 --> 01:50:45,652
And I think that discussion actually, and I'm a resident, that discussion should be had.

1371
01:50:46,192 --> 01:50:47,133
It should be ironed out.

1372
01:50:47,753 --> 01:50:52,274
So we know what we're doing with both of those properties and how to interact with them.

1373
01:50:52,575 --> 01:50:52,755
Yeah.

1374
01:50:52,995 --> 01:50:56,696
And I think maybe if nothing else, although I think we actually agree on a lot between the,

1375
01:50:57,236 --> 01:50:58,416
works of state in the cemetery.

1376
01:50:58,816 --> 01:51:05,418
I think the fact that both of those areas have gone under addressed and underserved for a really long time is a point of unity.

1377
01:51:06,018 --> 01:51:10,079
Um, and you know, I think also points us in the direction of a solution in my opinion.

1378
01:51:10,139 --> 01:51:13,219
So thank you for having that conversation.

1379
01:51:14,680 --> 01:51:15,080
Absolutely.

1380
01:51:15,480 --> 01:51:15,760
All right.

1381
01:51:16,240 --> 01:51:17,600
Leaf vacuum.

1382
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:23,602
Councilors are Oh, Yep.

1383
01:51:24,082 --> 01:51:24,502
Thank you.

1384
01:51:25,022 --> 01:51:25,122
Um,

1385
01:51:27,534 --> 01:51:30,898
Is the LEAP vacuum, how is it powered?

1386
01:51:30,918 --> 01:51:34,762
It's got a lawnmower engine on it.

1387
01:51:35,123 --> 01:51:36,684
Okay, and it's attached to the truck?

1388
01:51:37,365 --> 01:51:39,508
It's actually on its own individual trailer.

1389
01:51:40,172 --> 01:51:48,834
And it has a tube on it, and when he sucked the leaves up, it mulches them and puts them into the second part of that, which is the box.

1390
01:51:48,854 --> 01:51:49,574
The box for a dump truck.

1391
01:51:49,795 --> 01:51:52,615
The leaf box gets mounted on the back of a pickup truck.

1392
01:51:52,895 --> 01:51:53,876
Where is it operated?

1393
01:51:54,316 --> 01:51:56,616
That particular one will be in the cemetery.

1394
01:51:56,676 --> 01:51:57,256
In the cemetery.

1395
01:51:57,276 --> 01:51:57,977
That's for the cemetery.

1396
01:51:58,037 --> 01:51:59,037
Only for use in the cemetery?

1397
01:51:59,057 --> 01:51:59,277
Correct.

1398
01:51:59,557 --> 01:51:59,757
Great.

1399
01:52:00,057 --> 01:52:10,783
So we have an ordinance about leaf blowers and still, so the gas-powered leaf blowers are not allowed in residential areas in Medford and the gas-powered ones, the very loud ones.

1400
01:52:11,383 --> 01:52:21,889
And just last week, I was in my own neighborhood half a block from my house driving home and I had to pull my car over and talk to a man who owns a landscaping company.

1401
01:52:22,345 --> 01:52:25,145
and tell him that it was illegal, that he was using a gas-powered leaf blower.

1402
01:52:25,225 --> 01:52:38,068
I just wanted to make sure we weren't gonna be having the city have, I think it's even in the ordinance that maybe that we can, but if this is inside the, just to be used inside the cemetery, I think it's fine.

1403
01:52:38,228 --> 01:52:41,908
Those gas-powered sort of pieces of equipment can be very loud and chaotic.

1404
01:52:41,928 --> 01:52:43,709
That's specifically allocated for the cemetery.

1405
01:52:43,749 --> 01:52:43,989
Got it.

1406
01:52:44,349 --> 01:52:47,149
So just for cleaning up around those big spaces.

1407
01:52:47,189 --> 01:52:51,930
Yeah, for them to do leaf pickup on large piles, stuff like that.

1408
01:52:52,130 --> 01:52:52,350
Got it.

1409
01:52:52,450 --> 01:52:52,770
Thank you.

1410
01:52:53,610 --> 01:52:54,971
Great.

1411
01:52:55,091 --> 01:52:58,612
Mike, are you going to talk about the fire pickup trucks or the police cruisers?

1412
01:52:58,872 --> 01:53:01,052
Let's do that now, too, so we can get you out of here, too.

1413
01:53:01,112 --> 01:53:01,613
Oh, OK.

1414
01:53:01,693 --> 01:53:01,993
All right.

1415
01:53:04,153 --> 01:53:08,134
We'll do the fire pickup trucks, $166,000 for two pickup trucks?

1416
01:53:08,995 --> 01:53:09,195
Yes.

1417
01:53:10,755 --> 01:53:10,995
Great.

1418
01:53:12,095 --> 01:53:12,736
We got the chief.

1419
01:53:13,276 --> 01:53:13,796
We got you.

1420
01:53:14,496 --> 01:53:15,116
What are we doing here?

1421
01:53:16,197 --> 01:53:19,097
We're purchasing two pickup trucks.

1422
01:53:19,277 --> 01:53:21,078
One is actually replacing.

1423
01:53:23,273 --> 01:53:27,654
a truck we just took out of service, the one that closed the boat, correct?

1424
01:53:27,974 --> 01:53:28,994
Yeah, that was a 2001.

1425
01:53:29,114 --> 01:53:38,016
Yeah, it's replacing a 2001 pickup truck that we just recently took out of service for repairs, that it's too far gone.

1426
01:53:38,756 --> 01:53:42,216
And then the other one is going to be a command vehicle.

1427
01:53:42,897 --> 01:53:46,817
It's going to be the backup to the command vehicle that's replacing a toddler.

1428
01:53:48,798 --> 01:53:49,018
Great.

1429
01:53:50,098 --> 01:53:51,538
Anything else you want to add, Chief Evans?

1430
01:53:53,721 --> 01:53:56,483
Nope, Mike just pretty much hamming it out there.

1431
01:53:56,823 --> 01:53:57,304
All right.

1432
01:53:57,504 --> 01:53:58,024
Pretty simple.

1433
01:53:58,365 --> 01:53:58,645
Great.

1434
01:53:59,146 --> 01:54:02,268
And then maybe it looks like I think for police, we also only have the cruiser.

1435
01:54:02,348 --> 01:54:03,710
So we'll take you guys.

1436
01:54:03,810 --> 01:54:06,833
And if you want Mike to do the talking, that's your call, but.

1437
01:54:07,033 --> 01:54:11,036
Members of the council, good evening.

1438
01:54:11,056 --> 01:54:14,440
Yeah, we would respectfully ask for 3-2026.

1439
01:54:18,321 --> 01:54:21,904
police interceptor explorers, the hybrid engines.

1440
01:54:22,664 --> 01:54:26,367
These would be used to replace some of the vehicles in our aging fleet.

1441
01:54:26,647 --> 01:54:27,828
I emphasize aging.

1442
01:54:28,728 --> 01:54:35,653
We have 2014 vehicles in our fleet right now with north of 140,000 miles on them.

1443
01:54:36,314 --> 01:54:37,755
So I work with Mike every day.

1444
01:54:37,815 --> 01:54:38,775
They do a great job.

1445
01:54:39,816 --> 01:54:41,117
They keep us running basically.

1446
01:54:41,702 --> 01:54:42,122
every day.

1447
01:54:42,643 --> 01:54:47,066
We give them a lot of business, to say the least.

1448
01:54:47,547 --> 01:54:55,233
But our plan is, right now, we have two patrol supervisor vehicles in the fleet, the 2018s.

1449
01:54:55,393 --> 01:54:56,594
We'd like to replace them.

1450
01:54:57,655 --> 01:55:01,278
And with the third one, we'd replace one of our 2014 vehicles.

1451
01:55:02,599 --> 01:55:05,802
And over the years, we've had to decommission quite a few vehicles.

1452
01:55:06,614 --> 01:55:08,575
I think we've done at least a half a dozen anyway.

1453
01:55:08,875 --> 01:55:12,377
I think we lost five or six just in the past year.

1454
01:55:13,018 --> 01:55:16,700
One got totaled, one got hit outside the police station and it was a total.

1455
01:55:17,380 --> 01:55:22,543
And it hurts because that was a 2017 and with insurance and everything, we only got like $12,000.

1456
01:55:22,583 --> 01:55:24,804
You can't do anything with $12,000.

1457
01:55:26,005 --> 01:55:33,609
So we have some vehicles that definitely need a replacement and this will provide a big boost for the offices.

1458
01:55:35,473 --> 01:55:35,673
Great.

1459
01:55:35,933 --> 01:55:39,134
Do we have any questions on the fire and police vehicles from the council?

1460
01:55:41,694 --> 01:55:42,274
Councilor Lemming?

1461
01:55:44,134 --> 01:55:47,115
So this is how much you're requesting three.

1462
01:55:47,155 --> 01:55:52,876
If you had to give an estimate, how many would you say that you needed if you like had an ideal number?

1463
01:55:52,916 --> 01:55:57,857
Like, do you think three would- I'd like to get more than three, but- How many more?

1464
01:55:58,637 --> 01:55:59,137
How many more?

1465
01:55:59,157 --> 01:56:00,557
How many can you give me?

1466
01:56:00,617 --> 01:56:02,878
Well, we can't give you any, but we just want to know.

1467
01:56:02,938 --> 01:56:03,878
I'd love to see four.

1468
01:56:06,056 --> 01:56:14,600
One of the issues that we have, and I know that we talked before, and we hit the nail on the head with what we were talking about, and we learned.

1469
01:56:14,980 --> 01:56:20,002
These vehicles aren't on the lot, so what happens is we have to order them, and that takes a long time.

1470
01:56:20,423 --> 01:56:21,883
It really, really takes a long time.

1471
01:56:21,903 --> 01:56:22,864
Especially since COVID.

1472
01:56:22,924 --> 01:56:29,387
Yeah, and it's just backlogged, and it's just... So we have to order these vehicles, and these vehicles themselves then have to be outfitted.

1473
01:56:29,487 --> 01:56:31,047
It's not like buying a normal vehicle.

1474
01:56:31,067 --> 01:56:32,248
We're talking about putting lights

1475
01:56:33,174 --> 01:56:40,156
electronics, computers, decals, the blue lights, storage in the back, cages in the back.

1476
01:56:42,116 --> 01:56:42,936
That takes a while.

1477
01:56:43,276 --> 01:56:45,417
We had an order a couple of years ago.

1478
01:56:45,457 --> 01:56:50,138
It took, I mean, we were giving the fire department a run, because I know it takes them a long time to get an engine.

1479
01:56:50,278 --> 01:56:53,379
It took us over a year to get that cruiser on the road.

1480
01:56:54,199 --> 01:57:01,681
We actually had to pull it from one of the places that we had it at and put it in a different location, because they couldn't fulfill the order.

1481
01:57:02,523 --> 01:57:08,708
And this, this is something we have to be aware of, because we order these cars, let's say we order them tomorrow, we're not going to see them for a while.

1482
01:57:09,428 --> 01:57:13,191
So in the meantime, we have this aging fleet getting older.

1483
01:57:13,431 --> 01:57:21,877
And unfortunately, since COVID, all the, all the manufacturers, the vehicle manufacturers, they've changed the way they do things.

1484
01:57:21,997 --> 01:57:22,758
I could call them up.

1485
01:57:23,402 --> 01:57:25,884
tomorrow and say, order me three trucks.

1486
01:57:26,104 --> 01:57:27,826
And they would show up in 10 to 12 weeks.

1487
01:57:28,466 --> 01:57:32,289
Now the manufacturers require me, they have an order bank window.

1488
01:57:32,869 --> 01:57:37,893
So I have to order everything I want in this two month time frame.

1489
01:57:38,274 --> 01:57:41,016
And then the vehicles don't show up for like six, seven months.

1490
01:57:41,596 --> 01:57:45,039
Then we have to send them to the upfitter, which usually takes two or three months more.

1491
01:57:45,599 --> 01:57:49,603
So these particular vehicles, we will probably see those in May.

1492
01:57:50,482 --> 01:57:57,769
uh, that's, that's a, that's a timeframe estimate to have them delivered May, June timeframe of next year, if they get approved tonight.

1493
01:57:58,070 --> 01:57:58,270
Yeah.

1494
01:57:58,670 --> 01:58:04,516
So it just, unfortunately due to COVID, it just, it turned my world upside down.

1495
01:58:05,056 --> 01:58:05,317
Yeah.

1496
01:58:05,357 --> 01:58:06,938
So, but they're, they're badly needed.

1497
01:58:08,280 --> 01:58:09,581
Yeah, no, I mean, we hear you.

1498
01:58:09,981 --> 01:58:11,523
The only thing I can do is give you less cruisers.

1499
01:58:11,928 --> 01:58:19,015
Yeah, that's the only thing the council can do we can we can just cut, we can increase we can amend we can just cut or say no, or say yes.

1500
01:58:21,439 --> 01:58:22,359
Hey, even then, right?

1501
01:58:22,880 --> 01:58:33,625
So if we, I think having a conversation about getting on a schedule, especially given the scheduling concerns that are now an issue for you with the timeframe of ordering these things.

1502
01:58:34,365 --> 01:58:40,088
I will say we've done pretty good the last couple of years with the mayor's office and everything.

1503
01:58:40,148 --> 01:58:47,791
And it seems the way we're getting a schedule where we get X amount every single year and we can rotate the stock and it seems to be working out good right now.

1504
01:58:47,871 --> 01:58:48,112
Great.

1505
01:58:48,972 --> 01:58:50,213
That's helpful information I have too.

1506
01:58:51,413 --> 01:58:54,775
All right, I'll go to Councilor Callahan, and then I got one more question for you, Mike.

1507
01:58:55,236 --> 01:58:56,316
Councilor Callahan.

1508
01:58:56,496 --> 01:58:57,277
So I'm just curious.

1509
01:58:57,437 --> 01:58:59,698
I note that we're replacing the fire truck from 2001.

1510
01:58:59,758 --> 01:59:03,181
We're replacing the police cars from 2018.

1511
01:59:03,221 --> 01:59:03,181
2014.

1512
01:59:03,241 --> 01:59:05,622
And one from 2014.

1513
01:59:05,662 --> 01:59:06,583
Yes.

1514
01:59:07,303 --> 01:59:10,585
I know I didn't own a car for 20 years, and then I bought a 20-year-old car.

1515
01:59:11,006 --> 01:59:15,649
That was six years ago, and my car this summer, finally, 26-year-old car, finally died.

1516
01:59:15,669 --> 01:59:17,049
So I bought a 15-year-old car.

1517
01:59:18,871 --> 01:59:32,259
But I'm curious about, like, is this a thing that we will see, like, that the trucks are going to be, you know, 25 years before we replace them, but the cars are going to be seven years, the police cars are going to be seven years?

1518
01:59:32,819 --> 01:59:39,864
Like, just looking at that sort of differential between, like, the age of the vehicles, clearly there are different kinds of vehicles.

1519
01:59:39,924 --> 01:59:43,806
So what I try to do is I kind of have a master plan.

1520
01:59:45,257 --> 01:59:52,861
Believe it or not, with the police and fire admin cars, I tried to do 10 years.

1521
01:59:53,421 --> 01:59:57,844
The DPW vehicles, the average expected life is 15 years.

1522
01:59:58,844 --> 02:00:03,727
Takes a lot of work to make them last that long, but we do our best.

1523
02:00:05,148 --> 02:00:08,890
With the police vehicles, my estimate is seven to eight years.

1524
02:00:09,710 --> 02:00:11,391
And by that time, they've

1525
02:00:12,902 --> 02:00:15,143
They cost more to repair than they're worth.

1526
02:00:16,103 --> 02:00:18,264
So those are the timelines that I use.

1527
02:00:20,524 --> 02:00:28,226
Unfortunately, I've only been in this position six or seven years, and we're just getting this ramped up now.

1528
02:00:29,267 --> 02:00:29,907
In the past,

1529
02:00:31,191 --> 02:00:37,933
hold on to vehicles for 20, 25 years and, you know, duct tape and bubble gum just to get them to plow, you know?

1530
02:00:37,974 --> 02:00:42,275
So, um, and that's where like that 2001 comes in.

1531
02:00:42,695 --> 02:00:46,177
It was the top of the fleet and it got moved down and down and down.

1532
02:00:46,457 --> 02:00:49,538
And then eventually it rendered useless.

1533
02:00:49,918 --> 02:00:55,600
So I guess I'm just, I'm just looking ahead thinking, are we going to need like

1534
02:00:56,523 --> 02:01:07,508
the age of the fire trucks, are they all like way, and I know we've been through this before, but we're gonna need to be spending on fire trucks more because those are so much older.

1535
02:01:07,628 --> 02:01:10,470
As the years goes on, we're gonna be needing to spend money, yes.

1536
02:01:11,370 --> 02:01:17,793
So when it reaches a certain age, then we begin to stop the process of replacing it.

1537
02:01:18,762 --> 02:01:21,204
Those police cruises, a lot of them are going 24-7.

1538
02:01:21,284 --> 02:01:23,266
Around the clock.

1539
02:01:23,566 --> 02:01:24,808
Yeah, those things don't shut off.

1540
02:01:24,828 --> 02:01:31,814
They're not shutting off, so their life expectancy's not as much, unfortunately.

1541
02:01:32,995 --> 02:01:37,799
And when you're talking about the fire trucks themselves, those are now like five-year wait times.

1542
02:01:38,540 --> 02:01:43,725
The fire trucks are now, it's about a year going through the process of speccing out the truck.

1543
02:01:44,343 --> 02:01:47,627
And then four years from the date of signing the contract.

1544
02:01:47,647 --> 02:01:56,817
So it's tough to actually start preparing for planning the new fire trucks because of these long wait times now that are going on.

1545
02:01:57,738 --> 02:02:01,582
And we've done two or three engines and a ladder in the last five years.

1546
02:02:01,602 --> 02:02:02,483
Does that sound about right?

1547
02:02:04,918 --> 02:02:16,871
We just recently replaced our engine four because that one just happened to be on a lot somewhere that we were actually able to acquire because of a different department that couldn't fit in their station.

1548
02:02:16,912 --> 02:02:21,296
So we were able to make that truck work luckily, and we grabbed that one right away.

1549
02:02:21,357 --> 02:02:25,461
But we ordered a couple engines back in 23.

1550
02:02:27,207 --> 02:02:30,628
we were told that those are gonna arrive here at the end of this year.

1551
02:02:31,428 --> 02:02:40,070
And we were recently told that now those are gonna be bumped up to lucky October or November of next year, they told us now, so.

1552
02:02:43,751 --> 02:02:47,132
Do we have any other questions on the vehicles in this appropriation?

1553
02:02:48,878 --> 02:02:50,241
Mike, I just have one question for you.

1554
02:02:50,461 --> 02:02:55,591
How are you guys doing down there in fleet staff wise with the volume of work that you guys have to do?

1555
02:02:55,611 --> 02:02:57,514
Staff wise, we're struggling.

1556
02:02:57,815 --> 02:02:58,636
Yeah.

1557
02:03:00,177 --> 02:03:03,480
We're getting by just for obviously I'm very shorthanded.

1558
02:03:03,840 --> 02:03:07,103
Try and do the best we can with what we got.

1559
02:03:08,865 --> 02:03:13,409
And I'm just waiting for applicants to be honest.

1560
02:03:13,429 --> 02:03:17,333
But I got two guys down there and they're busting their butt.

1561
02:03:17,653 --> 02:03:18,814
They're getting it done.

1562
02:03:19,134 --> 02:03:21,096
So we're going into winter now.

1563
02:03:21,136 --> 02:03:25,320
So it'll be a little bit more hectic, but getting the sand and all the snow equipment ready.

1564
02:03:25,772 --> 02:03:26,533
Yeah.

1565
02:03:26,853 --> 02:03:31,778
When you say waiting for applicants, you got some open positions or I have two open positions right now.

1566
02:03:31,838 --> 02:03:32,078
Yes.

1567
02:03:32,359 --> 02:03:32,679
All right.

1568
02:03:32,699 --> 02:03:38,605
So, but unfortunately it's, uh, I'm not getting any applicants.

1569
02:03:40,119 --> 02:03:41,940
And it's kind of on the top of my radar.

1570
02:03:42,621 --> 02:03:51,846
Yeah, it's on the top of my radar, you know, and been in discussions with my boss's chief of staff and trying to figure out what to do and situation so backup plans.

1571
02:03:52,446 --> 02:03:55,728
We're in a tough spot just because of the market for jobs with mechanics.

1572
02:03:56,269 --> 02:03:58,470
So folks, you know, want to be a mechanic.

1573
02:03:59,150 --> 02:04:03,031
in Medford Public Works, here's my plea, please come and apply.

1574
02:04:03,891 --> 02:04:05,412
So anyway, it's a great place to work.

1575
02:04:05,772 --> 02:04:14,634
We need mechanics, we are starting a program with the Vogue to get some young mechanics in there, but that's tough when we don't even have enough mentors to do that.

1576
02:04:15,374 --> 02:04:19,215
And we're running around trying to service all these vehicles.

1577
02:04:19,815 --> 02:04:21,896
So it's a tough spot.

1578
02:04:22,496 --> 02:04:26,341
But we'll pull through and we're coming up with every idea we can come up with.

1579
02:04:26,662 --> 02:04:28,844
When you say the market, you mean the compensation.

1580
02:04:29,728 --> 02:04:30,068
Say again?

1581
02:04:30,468 --> 02:04:32,809
When you say the market, you mean the compensation or?

1582
02:04:32,849 --> 02:04:33,350
That's part of it.

1583
02:04:33,850 --> 02:04:34,590
That's part of it.

1584
02:04:34,610 --> 02:04:38,472
But the other part of it is, is everybody's looking for mechanics.

1585
02:04:38,912 --> 02:04:46,135
So everybody's, I mean, I spoke to a friend of mine that is, is the shop manager for a dealership.

1586
02:04:46,636 --> 02:04:47,836
I asked him, when are you paying the guys?

1587
02:04:47,856 --> 02:04:48,897
And he said, whatever they want.

1588
02:04:49,777 --> 02:04:54,519
So, I mean, it's just everybody, the entire industry is struggling for mechanics.

1589
02:04:54,999 --> 02:04:55,380
Yeah.

1590
02:04:55,420 --> 02:04:56,420
So, okay.

1591
02:04:56,767 --> 02:05:01,151
But it's a good, solid job, and I encourage folks who are interested to reach out.

1592
02:05:01,752 --> 02:05:01,912
Yeah.

1593
02:05:02,753 --> 02:05:05,475
If nothing else, to help out Mike here.

1594
02:05:06,696 --> 02:05:07,617
Absolutely.

1595
02:05:07,737 --> 02:05:08,898
Yes, yes, yes.

1596
02:05:09,018 --> 02:05:13,202
My guy's keeping us afloat, and I really appreciate how hard they work.

1597
02:05:13,322 --> 02:05:14,063
Yeah.

1598
02:05:14,083 --> 02:05:15,224
We really appreciate your team, too.

1599
02:05:15,284 --> 02:05:15,825
I just wanted to...

1600
02:05:17,057 --> 02:05:21,220
I can sense that you're working a little harder than you, you know, maybe a little overwork.

1601
02:05:21,260 --> 02:05:23,622
Yeah, I can see it.

1602
02:05:23,682 --> 02:05:28,185
It also adds to the cost of, you know, these guys are able to handle things in house.

1603
02:05:28,425 --> 02:05:28,685
Right.

1604
02:05:28,845 --> 02:05:30,807
No, and I know things and it's adding to cost.

1605
02:05:30,867 --> 02:05:32,568
I have to send them out to other places now.

1606
02:05:32,888 --> 02:05:34,529
Yeah.

1607
02:05:35,790 --> 02:05:40,754
I can't see all your fingernails from here, but I think I'm allowed to go into other departments and get mechanics.

1608
02:05:40,834 --> 02:05:42,095
So any takers?

1609
02:05:47,510 --> 02:05:47,830
All right.

1610
02:05:48,350 --> 02:05:49,771
Mike and his team do a great job.

1611
02:05:49,791 --> 02:05:52,012
They keep the fire alive and they keep us alive too.

1612
02:05:52,293 --> 02:05:52,513
I know.

1613
02:05:52,533 --> 02:05:53,693
And it's a daily thing.

1614
02:05:54,074 --> 02:05:54,834
They've been amazing.

1615
02:05:55,314 --> 02:06:02,979
I know how hard they work and, you know, Mike's usually, usually level-headed, but I could tell tonight he's been maybe a little overworked.

1616
02:06:05,120 --> 02:06:05,461
All right.

1617
02:06:05,561 --> 02:06:06,201
Thanks you guys.

1618
02:06:06,762 --> 02:06:10,824
We're going to go to facilities and then we'll come to Owen for water sewer.

1619
02:06:10,844 --> 02:06:15,367
Do we have Paul Riggi on Zoom for the facilities items?

1620
02:06:19,777 --> 02:06:20,998
I see him, I just asked him to unmute.

1621
02:06:21,758 --> 02:06:22,878
Hey, Paul, how you doing?

1622
02:06:23,519 --> 02:06:25,400
I'm good, how are you, President Behrs?

1623
02:06:26,320 --> 02:06:27,580
Good, I'll read the items.

1624
02:06:28,561 --> 02:06:29,561
I'll read the items real quick.

1625
02:06:29,601 --> 02:06:44,528
We had 340,000 for ADA compliant renovations for two bathrooms on the first floor of City Hall, 79,200 for design work at the Hegner Center, 32,000 for fire department paving projects, and 30,000 for the replacement of the hot water heater at the police station.

1626
02:06:46,270 --> 02:06:47,031
That is correct.

1627
02:06:48,994 --> 02:06:57,204
Well, as all the councillors are aware, City Hall does not have any fully ADA compliant bathrooms.

1628
02:06:58,005 --> 02:07:04,613
So this is to bring the men's and women's room on the first floor, which are currently the

1629
02:07:05,474 --> 02:07:11,076
indicated as the staff only bathrooms up to be fully ADA compliant.

1630
02:07:11,976 --> 02:07:26,160
My plan is that over the next several years we can renovate every bathroom at City Hall and by doing that we can make every bathroom fully ADA compliant.

1631
02:07:26,381 --> 02:07:34,143
But we really do need ADA compliant bathrooms at City Hall and this project would complete that.

1632
02:07:35,809 --> 02:07:53,825
The paving at the fire stations has been something in law long coming engine for driveway on the side of the building to the back of the building where most of the firefighters park has been in disrepair for several years, so I'm.

1633
02:07:54,442 --> 02:08:03,944
working with the DPW to use their vendor to pave that area so it's not a hazard for our firefighters.

1634
02:08:04,725 --> 02:08:07,946
The other part of that piece is at headquarters.

1635
02:08:08,566 --> 02:08:12,807
There is a side parking area that was never paved

1636
02:08:14,108 --> 02:08:17,053
This causes damage to the fire vehicles.

1637
02:08:17,534 --> 02:08:26,131
So by paving this, we can have a safe place for fire vehicles to be able to park and to end the damage to those vehicles.

1638
02:08:27,454 --> 02:08:32,357
The Heckner Center will be used as the city's resiliency center.

1639
02:08:32,557 --> 02:08:43,802
We have a grant for that, but the grant did not include funding for the architectural development of that site.

1640
02:08:44,023 --> 02:08:48,005
I've been working with the Board of Health and

1641
02:08:48,965 --> 02:08:52,687
Department of Recreation to come up with a concept.

1642
02:08:52,907 --> 02:09:01,171
Our architects team has that, and this is the cost to put those designs to paper for us.

1643
02:09:03,713 --> 02:09:15,599
The police station, unfortunately, the hot water system for the showers in the men's and locker rooms has basically not worked since the building opened.

1644
02:09:16,952 --> 02:09:22,793
There was work done during year one to get that system back up and running.

1645
02:09:23,733 --> 02:09:25,574
It did, but sporadically.

1646
02:09:26,094 --> 02:09:31,295
And since I've been here, the system probably has been down more than it's up.

1647
02:09:32,255 --> 02:09:45,277
This would replace the system with a much more sensical system that would provide hot water in the showers for the police officers when they need it.

1648
02:09:49,777 --> 02:09:51,538
I think I hit everything, did I?

1649
02:09:52,719 --> 02:09:52,900
Yep.

1650
02:09:53,700 --> 02:09:54,661
Thank you, Paul.

1651
02:09:54,701 --> 02:09:56,943
Do we have any questions on that from members of the council?

1652
02:09:56,963 --> 02:10:02,627
All right.

1653
02:10:02,748 --> 02:10:09,933
Seeing none, the only other item in the general capital stabilization fund was $16,500 for updates to the capital improvement plan.

1654
02:10:09,953 --> 02:10:14,817
The chief of staff did tell me she wasn't going to be able to be here tonight to talk about that.

1655
02:10:20,712 --> 02:10:20,912
Yeah.

1656
02:10:22,133 --> 02:10:24,954
So we'll go to the Water Sewer Capital Stabilization.

1657
02:10:24,974 --> 02:10:27,535
We have City Engineer Wartella here.

1658
02:10:27,675 --> 02:10:36,720
We have $175,000 for additional costs relating to a sewer line rehab project and $60,000 for a sewer survey project related to inflow and infiltration.

1659
02:10:37,480 --> 02:10:38,581
Owen, what's up with this?

1660
02:10:39,502 --> 02:10:44,006
We have been actively doing large sewer projects this year.

1661
02:10:44,546 --> 02:10:46,588
We found some contaminated soils.

1662
02:10:46,628 --> 02:10:47,469
We need to take care of it.

1663
02:10:47,689 --> 02:10:48,970
So there are some overages there.

1664
02:10:49,711 --> 02:10:55,136
And there are some other overages with we're doing extra lining and stuff like that.

1665
02:10:57,783 --> 02:11:07,631
And then the $60,000 for the sewer survey is trying to keep up with all the new development that is occurring in our city.

1666
02:11:08,772 --> 02:11:17,680
This sewer survey will get us ahead so that these developers can do I&I that's required for their projects.

1667
02:11:18,300 --> 02:11:25,887
So instead of us doing that work, the developers are doing this work for us as required part of their development.

1668
02:11:26,587 --> 02:11:38,390
And so they'll be doing probably close to a half a million gallons of mitigation in sewer inflow over the next couple of years, which the first step is to have a sewer survey.

1669
02:11:41,211 --> 02:11:41,411
Great.

1670
02:11:41,431 --> 02:11:43,352
Do we have any questions?

1671
02:11:43,732 --> 02:11:44,652
Councilor Callahan?

1672
02:11:46,444 --> 02:11:46,664
Thanks.

1673
02:11:47,365 --> 02:11:59,612
I would just love a super quick update on our, you know, 300 million year old sewer and water lines, if you can give in a minute or less.

1674
02:12:00,372 --> 02:12:05,755
This city's sewer and water is probably one of the oldest in the state, other than Boston.

1675
02:12:06,315 --> 02:12:07,376
It is extremely old.

1676
02:12:08,176 --> 02:12:09,237
It's over 100 years old.

1677
02:12:09,877 --> 02:12:14,000
It was made with brick and clay and cast iron, and it's

1678
02:12:15,461 --> 02:12:19,102
Because of its age, it's deteriorating pretty quickly.

1679
02:12:19,142 --> 02:12:21,163
It's definitely well past its end of life.

1680
02:12:22,104 --> 02:12:26,826
And we are trying to make sure that we stay ahead of it.

1681
02:12:27,347 --> 02:12:34,070
And we've upped our sewer maintenance programs for the past couple years.

1682
02:12:34,590 --> 02:12:35,751
We've been doing a lot more.

1683
02:12:36,171 --> 02:12:38,713
And this project that we just finished,

1684
02:12:39,633 --> 02:12:46,362
Sewer lining project basically lines the pipe and keeps the sewer in and the groundwater out.

1685
02:12:48,645 --> 02:12:50,547
Just a little bit of

1686
02:12:52,631 --> 02:12:56,252
Like, where are we on our ability to be able to make all these repairs?

1687
02:12:57,052 --> 02:13:00,873
Like, we're still in the planning phase, right, of how we're going to make all these repairs?

1688
02:13:01,533 --> 02:13:02,413
No, we've got plans.

1689
02:13:02,773 --> 02:13:08,194
Basically, we've gotten some studies where we have many sewer areas.

1690
02:13:08,894 --> 02:13:10,634
And those areas we're targeting.

1691
02:13:10,854 --> 02:13:13,115
And we've gone pretty much about halfway through that.

1692
02:13:13,235 --> 02:13:18,356
But with the sewer survey, we're trying to let the developers do a lot of this work.

1693
02:13:19,156 --> 02:13:24,683
uh, so that we can focus on other like water is basically lead lines is what we're focusing on right now.

1694
02:13:25,103 --> 02:13:25,684
Okay, thanks.

1695
02:13:25,824 --> 02:13:27,326
But I'm trying to do both at once.

1696
02:13:27,586 --> 02:13:27,827
Yeah.

1697
02:13:30,009 --> 02:13:36,737
Yeah, I think just the where Councilor Callahan is getting is we have tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars to work on the water and sewer system.

1698
02:13:37,178 --> 02:13:37,378
Yes.

1699
02:13:37,598 --> 02:13:38,960
You know, there's big backlog.

1700
02:13:39,793 --> 02:13:41,494
There is a large backlog.

1701
02:13:42,234 --> 02:13:45,056
We are still actively trying to tackle it.

1702
02:13:46,376 --> 02:13:48,517
If you wanna add anything to this?

1703
02:13:48,758 --> 02:13:54,260
I know it's an oversimplification, but let's say when you started making the plans to fix it, the backlog was 100%.

1704
02:13:54,380 --> 02:13:57,702
Have we made it 10% of the way through it yet?

1705
02:13:58,783 --> 02:13:59,103
No, no.

1706
02:14:02,368 --> 02:14:03,569
Okay, I'm 1%.

1707
02:14:04,590 --> 02:14:08,233
I would say, maybe take one step back and look at it just a little bit differently.

1708
02:14:09,474 --> 02:14:19,282
I think we're at these things are so long term, we're really still in the planning phase, really, and what that has to do is the rate that we are all paying for water.

1709
02:14:20,203 --> 02:14:35,235
Because it's my opinion, I don't have really the math to back this up, but I think we could do the math and it would back it up, that we've been underrating ourselves for many decades when we should have been paying into our system, investing into our system.

1710
02:14:35,556 --> 02:14:36,477
I don't think we've been doing that.

1711
02:14:36,557 --> 02:14:37,237
And we're not alone.

1712
02:14:37,577 --> 02:14:40,480
So we've been just letting it rot away and getting by with paying the minimum.

1713
02:14:41,221 --> 02:14:52,607
But now, you know, now it's turning back on us because the leak rate is going up, the break rate is going up, the water quality rate is going down, and the population is going up.

1714
02:14:52,707 --> 02:15:03,253
So we're just kind of at that point where we need to look at the rates and say, okay, are we gonna get, you know, $3 million bigger this year or $4 million bigger this year?

1715
02:15:03,593 --> 02:15:06,175
So we've done that work, you know, and that's where

1716
02:15:07,055 --> 02:15:08,256
The rates came from last year.

1717
02:15:08,376 --> 02:15:10,717
It's where they're going to come from next year after that.

1718
02:15:11,437 --> 02:15:15,820
And it ties directly into our capital plan that Owen works on.

1719
02:15:16,220 --> 02:15:30,207
And that basically is a reflection of both that rate work and the physicality of the system, the rates, the pressures and the breaks, the water quality attributes, all of that.

1720
02:15:30,982 --> 02:15:45,236
So you merge those two together, and you're in a situation where last year we didn't make a dent, but we're planning to make bigger dense and bigger dance as the years go by, and that's the pace we should really be at, because when we talk about it's failing it's deteriorating.

1721
02:15:45,556 --> 02:15:46,758
Sure, we're getting like.

1722
02:15:47,839 --> 02:15:50,540
a handful more of massive breaks per year.

1723
02:15:51,141 --> 02:15:53,002
But we're talking on the scale of decades here.

1724
02:15:53,102 --> 02:16:01,428
So that's why it's hard to even report out what percentage dent we're making in the work that we need to do.

1725
02:16:02,208 --> 02:16:03,069
Hopefully that makes sense.

1726
02:16:03,289 --> 02:16:06,371
We could keep throwing money at it all day and all year and still not be there.

1727
02:16:06,651 --> 02:16:12,155
But if we do little increments at a time, by 2030, we'll be on the path to success.

1728
02:16:13,930 --> 02:16:14,190
Got it.

1729
02:16:14,350 --> 02:16:20,452
And to Owen's point, so you're making one point, Tim, which is that the rates were too low for too long.

1730
02:16:20,472 --> 02:16:22,353
It's basically paying the minimum on your credit card.

1731
02:16:22,393 --> 02:16:23,953
You're not actually addressing the issue.

1732
02:16:24,614 --> 02:16:26,174
And it's built up over time.

1733
02:16:26,194 --> 02:16:26,895
Correct.

1734
02:16:27,155 --> 02:16:34,557
But Owen also made the point that one of the main ways that we're trying to address it right now is like when new development comes in, getting them to make significant investments.

1735
02:16:34,797 --> 02:16:35,578
Yes.

1736
02:16:35,598 --> 02:16:36,398
So, you know,

1737
02:16:37,098 --> 02:16:46,336
There's essentially two things we increase in the water rates, or, you know, when we're trying to bring this new growth and that's a main way that we're addressing this problem as well.

1738
02:16:47,492 --> 02:16:48,552
I guess so.

1739
02:16:48,652 --> 02:16:52,154
But his point is in the realm of that's work that we already have to do.

1740
02:16:52,174 --> 02:16:53,334
We're already obligated to do it.

1741
02:16:53,374 --> 02:16:55,435
We've been working on it for decades, the II work.

1742
02:16:55,915 --> 02:17:00,376
And then these projects means that we're going to meet those goals quicker.

1743
02:17:00,877 --> 02:17:04,838
But that's not really going to affect the backlog of infrastructure work that we need to do.

1744
02:17:05,698 --> 02:17:10,460
That's a different category, I guess is a good way to put it.

1745
02:17:11,135 --> 02:17:12,136
Sure.

1746
02:17:12,736 --> 02:17:23,863
We still have old pipes, so we're still going to have to take care of the old infrastructure, but we have other means where we can have developers do it as well.

1747
02:17:24,343 --> 02:17:29,947
So you're saying that, for example, when we see a large project, we're making the developers replace the infrastructure?

1748
02:17:30,812 --> 02:17:43,183
To what we can, and this particular rule says that if you add over 15,000 gallons of water to the system per day, then you have to give four times that of mitigation.

1749
02:17:43,623 --> 02:17:49,108
So you seal that many leaks to make up four times 15,000 gallons.

1750
02:17:49,688 --> 02:17:50,549
So you're at 60.

1751
02:17:52,185 --> 02:17:53,406
That's a lot of leak patching.

1752
02:17:53,566 --> 02:17:54,728
And that's what he's talking about.

1753
02:17:54,968 --> 02:17:56,169
But we have to do that anyway.

1754
02:17:56,349 --> 02:17:58,652
That's work that we're already doing and already obligated to do.

1755
02:17:58,892 --> 02:18:00,934
It doesn't really make a dent on the backlog of work.

1756
02:18:00,954 --> 02:18:06,620
But point being that if there were no new developments, then the ratepayers are paying for it entirely because we have to do it anyway.

1757
02:18:07,091 --> 02:18:08,052
Entirely, yes.

1758
02:18:08,372 --> 02:18:08,472
Yeah.

1759
02:18:08,512 --> 02:18:09,033
All right.

1760
02:18:09,693 --> 02:18:18,399
So over the, I'm thinking of like the top four large projects have about 600,000 gallons worth of mitigation they need to do.

1761
02:18:19,300 --> 02:18:21,542
That's a lot, a lot, a lot.

1762
02:18:22,182 --> 02:18:25,404
And that will help improve our sewer rate because we pay for that water.

1763
02:18:25,424 --> 02:18:27,446
It gets metered and we pay for it.

1764
02:18:27,826 --> 02:18:30,728
So if we reduce that number, then that's good for everybody.

1765
02:18:31,169 --> 02:18:31,349
Yeah.

1766
02:18:32,710 --> 02:18:33,170
Thanks, you guys.

1767
02:18:34,451 --> 02:18:35,392
Any further questions on this?

1768
02:18:38,231 --> 02:18:46,554
Do we have a motion on the appropriation paper on the motion approved by Council, let me second by second by Councilman Zaro.

1769
02:18:46,734 --> 02:18:47,355
All those in favor.

1770
02:18:48,315 --> 02:18:49,796
Sorry actually, Mr. Clerk please call the roll.

1771
02:18:51,977 --> 02:18:52,497
Thank you very much.

1772
02:18:52,537 --> 02:18:52,757
Thanks.

1773
02:18:53,977 --> 02:18:54,297
Hold on.

1774
02:18:54,358 --> 02:18:57,359
Is there anyone who wants to talk about this.

1775
02:19:02,495 --> 02:19:05,056
I just had a question about the capital improvement plan update.

1776
02:19:05,096 --> 02:19:05,636
Do we know?

1777
02:19:05,656 --> 02:19:07,436
We do not have, sorry, go ahead.

1778
02:19:07,696 --> 02:19:08,776
There's no one here to talk about it.

1779
02:19:08,796 --> 02:19:12,477
There's no one here to talk about it, but still, do we know if that's like paying a consultant?

1780
02:19:12,577 --> 02:19:14,858
Is that like, what is, we don't know what that's for?

1781
02:19:15,998 --> 02:19:18,038
I'm not sure what it's for.

1782
02:19:18,298 --> 02:19:21,119
Last time they did the capital improvement plan, it was Collins Center.

1783
02:19:21,239 --> 02:19:23,919
So I would guess it's probably Collins Center to update it.

1784
02:19:23,939 --> 02:19:24,780
Okay.

1785
02:19:25,140 --> 02:19:26,360
But I didn't get that information.

1786
02:19:26,660 --> 02:19:26,860
Thank you.

1787
02:19:31,441 --> 02:19:33,823
All right, not seeing anyone else on this paper.

1788
02:19:33,883 --> 02:19:35,005
So Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1789
02:19:37,587 --> 02:19:50,620
Councilor Callahan, Vice President Collins, Councilor Zara, Councilor Lemming, Councilor Scapelli, Councilor Tsang, President Boos.

1790
02:19:51,648 --> 02:19:54,149
Yes, 70 affirmative, 90 negative, the motion passes.

1791
02:19:54,449 --> 02:19:55,770
Thanks, you guys.

1792
02:19:56,910 --> 02:20:00,731
I told folks that we'd do an executive session at 8.30, it's 9.15.

1793
02:20:00,932 --> 02:20:03,572
Could somebody move to take that so we can move into executive session?

1794
02:20:04,133 --> 02:20:14,777
On the motion of Councilor Sang, seconded by Councilor Lazaro, I'll take paper 25.144, and then I'll read it, and then we'll have to take a vote to go into executive session.

1795
02:20:14,857 --> 02:20:17,278
So this is just on the motion to take it off the table.

1796
02:20:17,898 --> 02:20:18,598
All those in favor?

1797
02:20:19,398 --> 02:20:19,899
Opposed?

1798
02:20:19,999 --> 02:20:20,899
Motion passes.

1799
02:20:22,772 --> 02:20:32,092
All right, paper 25144 litigation settlement request for executive session votes may be taken dear President bears and members of the city council.

1800
02:20:32,596 --> 02:20:50,121
I respectfully request and recommend your honorable body and enter Executive Session pursuant to General Law Chapter 30A Section 21A.3 to discuss strategy with respect to litigation concerning the matter of Teamsters Local 25 and the City of Medford, AAA No.

1801
02:20:50,141 --> 02:20:50,362
01-24-007-8702.

1802
02:20:50,382 --> 02:20:54,563
I also recommend that the Council's agenda state in the Executive Session Notice that votes may be taken.

1803
02:20:55,123 --> 02:20:59,785
Attorney Steven Johnson from KP Law will be present to provide the council with guidance on this matter.

1804
02:20:59,825 --> 02:21:01,246
Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.

1805
02:21:01,326 --> 02:21:02,786
Sincerely, Brian Oliver and Mayor.

1806
02:21:03,427 --> 02:21:07,509
I'm going to create a breakout room and we're going to go into room 207.

1807
02:21:07,609 --> 02:21:09,669
Kevin, you're welcome to join us if you want.

1808
02:21:11,790 --> 02:21:13,051
Give me one second there.

1809
02:21:14,111 --> 02:21:17,493
And then we'll come back into open session to finish the rest of the agenda.

1810
02:22:36,009 --> 02:22:41,434
On the motion to enter executive session by Councilor Lazaro, seconded by Vice President Collins.

1811
02:22:41,474 --> 02:22:42,454
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1812
02:22:44,856 --> 02:22:55,625
Councilor Callahan, Vice President Collins, Council Lazaro, Councilor Lemming, Councilor Scapelli, Councilor Singh, President Villescaz.

1813
02:22:55,705 --> 02:22:58,047
Yes, seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

1814
02:22:58,127 --> 02:22:59,368
We're going into executive session.

1815
02:22:59,709 --> 02:23:00,790
We'll return to open session.

1816
02:31:28,600 --> 02:31:35,246
On the motion to reconvene an open session by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by.

1817
02:31:36,347 --> 02:31:38,308
Seconded by Council Vice President Collins.

1818
02:31:38,348 --> 02:31:39,069
All those in favor?

1819
02:31:39,650 --> 02:31:40,070
Opposed?

1820
02:31:40,150 --> 02:31:40,891
Motion passes.

1821
02:31:40,911 --> 02:31:45,414
All right, reverting to the regular order of business.

1822
02:31:47,573 --> 02:31:53,279
We have 25103 offered by Vice President Collins, proposed amendments to the zoning ordinance, other corridors, districts.

1823
02:31:53,379 --> 02:31:58,625
This was tabled from the August 5th meeting at the request of the Community Development Board.

1824
02:31:59,606 --> 02:32:07,174
We still do not have an agreement between myself and the mayor to announce on the zoning project.

1825
02:32:08,536 --> 02:32:16,621
So I would recommend that we table this until we know if we're gonna update the city's 60 year old broken zoning.

1826
02:32:17,201 --> 02:32:18,082
Vice President Collins.

1827
02:32:20,817 --> 02:32:27,962
Thank you, President bears that says a lot of what I was going to say, just for history state for clarity.

1828
02:32:27,982 --> 02:32:32,304
This is on the agenda because it was tabled to the state.

1829
02:32:32,725 --> 02:32:42,331
The last time I was on the agenda, and the circumstances surrounding the zoning project are largely the same, the zoning consultant the contract with the zoning consultant ended at the end of the previous fiscal year.

1830
02:32:42,831 --> 02:32:43,652
We don't have a new one.

1831
02:32:44,832 --> 02:32:58,077
In addition, I understand the CDB is working to fill a lot of spaces on the CDB right now so that they can resume meeting hold holding their public meetings and working through their queue of proposals which includes zoning and other things besides.

1832
02:32:59,738 --> 02:33:06,701
I am eagerly awaiting an update from the mayor's office on when we can expect to see a renewed contract with the zoning consultant so that we can

1833
02:33:07,461 --> 02:33:24,218
not only continue our zoning review which many Medford residents have invested hours and hours and hours of time into not to mention a lot of money over many years has gone into this, but that we can actually expand it more resources more communication more information and more opportunities for people to participate.

1834
02:33:25,759 --> 02:33:30,364
So, with my motion to table, I hope that we can take it off the table within the next month or two.

1835
02:33:32,876 --> 02:33:34,938
Motion of Vice President Collins to table, seconded by?

1836
02:33:34,958 --> 02:33:35,638
Second.

1837
02:33:36,139 --> 02:33:38,140
Seconded by Councilor Zaro, all those in favor?

1838
02:33:38,901 --> 02:33:39,281
Opposed?

1839
02:33:39,361 --> 02:33:40,162
Motion passes.

1840
02:33:40,182 --> 02:33:43,705
25.124, the Tree Committee Ordinance.

1841
02:33:44,586 --> 02:33:49,069
Solicitor Foley has asked that we give a little more time for review on this.

1842
02:33:50,350 --> 02:33:52,852
So is there a motion on the floor?

1843
02:33:53,953 --> 02:33:56,835
On the motion to table by Councilor Callahan, seconded by?

1844
02:33:56,855 --> 02:33:58,096
Seconded.

1845
02:33:58,116 --> 02:33:59,898
Seconded by Councilor Lemming, all those in favor?

1846
02:34:00,787 --> 02:34:10,895
opposed motion passes 25135 offered by Vice President Collins be a result or whereas the Fair Act would protect workers in Massachusetts.

1847
02:34:11,553 --> 02:34:30,086
from harmful effects of proliferating AI by prohibiting employers from relying exclusively on AI decision-making systems to make employment-related decisions, by restricting the surveillance of workers and the collection, use, and sharing of surveillance data, by shoring up worker autonomy protections and protecting workers from reprisal for refusing or questioning the directives of AI-generated instructions.

1848
02:34:30,706 --> 02:34:40,413
Now, therefore, be it resolved that the Medford City Council expresses support of H-77 and S-35, an act fostering artificial intelligence responsibility, also known as the FAIR Act,

1849
02:34:40,970 --> 02:34:52,057
We have further resolved the city clerk forward a copy of this resolution to the Medford legislative delegation, as well as to the chairs of the joint committee on advanced information technology, the internet and cyber security vice president Collins.

1850
02:34:53,518 --> 02:34:54,359
Thank you, President bears.

1851
02:34:54,699 --> 02:35:08,148
I think the text kind of says it all I learned about this bill and because it has been endorsed by the AFL CIO, and there's significant union organizing going on in support of it this year.

1852
02:35:09,269 --> 02:35:29,332
Just to be perfectly clear, though, I think it's pretty clear from the text of the resolution itself, my advocacy for this bill and I think that our collective advocacy for this bill, it is not about advocating for AI in the workplace, it is meant to shore up protections and backstops for workers, including workers in our community, people who live here, people who just come here to work.

1853
02:35:30,412 --> 02:35:41,620
in a scenario where AI proliferating in the workplace that's already happening and it would be naive to think it's not going to continue to happen more in the future.

1854
02:35:41,840 --> 02:35:56,669
If workers are going to be forced to deal with AI and indeed to see AI take over more of their daily life at work, I think we should at least be advocating that it be mandatory that humans are not taken out of those workflows entirely.

1855
02:35:59,779 --> 02:36:15,105
In addition, there are already many documented harms to people in many contexts, including a work context, for the type of surveillance that AI technologies can do.

1856
02:36:16,665 --> 02:36:18,586
I think that threatens the role of the worker in the workplace.

1857
02:36:18,646 --> 02:36:27,728
I also think that's like a very, very real documented, clear and present threat to people and workers from a civil liberties and just basic safety standpoint.

1858
02:36:29,069 --> 02:36:40,312
So this is, I think, just a really common sense piece of Massachusetts legislation that is aimed just at protecting the existing role of workers at their jobs and making sure that new technologies, when they're introduced,

1859
02:36:40,992 --> 02:36:45,333
they augment the worker, they don't replace the worker, they don't make the worker any less safe.

1860
02:36:45,994 --> 02:37:04,199
So I hope that my fellow councillors will join with me in sending a clear signal to our state delegation that their constituents want to see them standing up for a scenario in which AI maybe complements our lives and does not threaten them.

1861
02:37:04,759 --> 02:37:05,039
Thank you.

1862
02:37:05,799 --> 02:37:06,439
Motion for approval.

1863
02:37:07,120 --> 02:37:07,600
Thank you.

1864
02:37:07,660 --> 02:37:08,280
Councillor Lemming.

1865
02:37:09,916 --> 02:37:12,917
I'd like to thank my colleague for bringing this forward.

1866
02:37:12,997 --> 02:37:15,458
So I'm a, I'm an AI researcher.

1867
02:37:15,538 --> 02:37:16,819
I agree with this.

1868
02:37:16,919 --> 02:37:25,002
I mean, AI is one of those, uh, it's kind of a weird area where it will have, and is currently having a lot of, um,

1869
02:37:26,573 --> 02:37:31,677
good potential effects, also a lot of harms within the economy.

1870
02:37:31,757 --> 02:37:36,841
It's a very powerful new, I'd say, range of technologies.

1871
02:37:38,262 --> 02:37:52,974
But essentially what happens with the private sector is that somebody jumps on an LLM, which is a very generally useful tool, and then they try to sort of exploit it to see how they could

1872
02:37:53,896 --> 02:37:59,088
cut workers out or save on human resources and things like that.

1873
02:37:59,249 --> 02:38:02,356
Usually the effect of doing that just ends up being

1874
02:38:03,924 --> 02:38:05,005
not really that great.

1875
02:38:05,045 --> 02:38:27,916
I think that one thing that the unions that are endorsing the FAIR Act are saying, for instance, is AI is having a hugely detrimental effect just in hiring these days, where you basically will have AI algorithms that are trying to look at and automatically parse through resumes.

1876
02:38:29,437 --> 02:38:31,118
And then you also have

1877
02:38:31,975 --> 02:38:39,781
people that sort of know how to leverage this technology, submitting their resumes, using some form of automation to as many companies as possible.

1878
02:38:39,821 --> 02:38:44,485
And essentially what happens is workers just, instead of making an honest resume that

1879
02:38:50,890 --> 02:38:51,970
shows their experiences.

1880
02:38:52,010 --> 02:39:00,353
They just learn how to sort of like phrase things correctly or write their resume in such a way that it'll be picked up by a certain LLM.

1881
02:39:00,713 --> 02:39:12,156
And when you have people that are submitting thousands upon thousands of resumes to thousands upon thousands of job openings, automatically it becomes impossible for HR people to actually look through them all one by one.

1882
02:39:12,196 --> 02:39:15,237
And so the whole hiring market already has been

1883
02:39:16,812 --> 02:39:20,337
really damaged by AI in some sectors.

1884
02:39:20,958 --> 02:39:28,609
So that's just one instance of where it's being massively misused.

1885
02:39:29,951 --> 02:39:32,314
And then some other employers also like to put out

1886
02:39:33,115 --> 02:39:40,258
ghost listings, where they just try to collect as many resumes as possible to train their own AI modules without actually ever hiring anybody.

1887
02:39:40,979 --> 02:39:43,700
So that's another trend that companies are doing.

1888
02:39:44,140 --> 02:39:47,902
And it's having a very strange effect on the economy.

1889
02:39:47,942 --> 02:39:55,265
So just to give folks a little bit more context into some of the thinking behind this act, but once again, I'm a

1890
02:39:55,857 --> 02:40:02,941
glad that folks are my colleague is bringing it forward and bring some attention to this bill, and I support it.

1891
02:40:03,082 --> 02:40:03,402
Thank you.

1892
02:40:04,983 --> 02:40:09,826
Thank you, Councilor say, I'll be really brief because I think Council let me get give a really

1893
02:40:12,482 --> 02:40:16,563
good and thorough explanation of why this bill is important.

1894
02:40:18,403 --> 02:40:27,044
But I just wanted to say, in talking to union leaders across the state, they had one message, and I thought that they put it really well.

1895
02:40:27,845 --> 02:40:30,445
AI can be a useful tool, but it shouldn't be a replacement.

1896
02:40:31,185 --> 02:40:41,747
And when it comes to things that are so important to the worker, so important to people's rights, and so important to general functioning of society,

1897
02:40:43,059 --> 02:40:45,601
We need to be careful about how we use these technologies.

1898
02:40:46,001 --> 02:40:52,626
Not that not to say that we should know should be completely closed off, but we need to be cautious with how we approach these things.

1899
02:40:54,027 --> 02:41:04,796
And so I'm grateful for Vice President Collins for introducing this resolution so we can show our support for this really important bill that will affect Medford workers as well.

1900
02:41:07,638 --> 02:41:07,938
Thank you.

1901
02:41:10,498 --> 02:41:14,100
On the motion of Councillor Collins to approve, seconded by.

1902
02:41:14,800 --> 02:41:15,841
Seconded by Councillor Singh.

1903
02:41:15,881 --> 02:41:18,142
Is there any further discussion members of the Council?

1904
02:41:18,162 --> 02:41:21,484
Any discussion members of the public?

1905
02:41:23,285 --> 02:41:24,325
I thought there might be.

1906
02:41:25,466 --> 02:41:27,007
Name and address for the record, please.

1907
02:41:27,027 --> 02:41:27,827
You'll have three minutes.

1908
02:41:28,027 --> 02:41:28,188
Sure.

1909
02:41:28,248 --> 02:41:28,448
Yeah.

1910
02:41:28,468 --> 02:41:29,368
My name is Micah Kesselman.

1911
02:41:29,388 --> 02:41:30,009
I live at 499 Main Street.

1912
02:41:30,069 --> 02:41:30,289
I will

1913
02:41:32,970 --> 02:41:36,953
do a rare thing and preface this by saying that I am an attorney, I'm a lawyer.

1914
02:41:37,914 --> 02:41:40,696
I am and director of IP at my current company.

1915
02:41:40,776 --> 02:41:49,142
But before that, I was IP counsel focused on our AI businesses for one of the largest medtech company, medtech multinationals in the world.

1916
02:41:49,522 --> 02:41:56,147
Before that, I worked at an AMLO 100 firm for a number of years specializing in, in

1917
02:41:58,677 --> 02:42:05,061
ML-enabled technology, IP, and generally high-tech and advanced software law.

1918
02:42:06,381 --> 02:42:15,486
And I say that just without having to go into a bunch of technical reasons, lend my support to passing this resolution.

1919
02:42:17,287 --> 02:42:22,090
There are a lot of great uses for AI or for ML-enabled technologies.

1920
02:42:22,883 --> 02:42:29,154
I, the hiring process in particular and I think if you talk to any employment attorney actually, they will say that.

1921
02:42:31,904 --> 02:42:35,066
use AI in your hiring process.

1922
02:42:36,087 --> 02:42:57,662
There are a litany of cases that have been settled by large employers who've used models that were not vetted sufficiently or with any degree of competency that have settled out of court for large sums of money because they were negligent or discriminatory.

1923
02:42:57,982 --> 02:43:00,644
In practice, this is an ongoing issue with AI.

1924
02:43:01,911 --> 02:43:03,332
So I do support this resolution.

1925
02:43:03,952 --> 02:43:20,745
I also think this is a good opportunity to bring up though that I do, I would like to see the council, and I believe many of our residents would like to see the council sort of start tackling some of these forward looking issues related to the advanced technology that's starting to roll out at a faster and faster pace.

1926
02:43:20,785 --> 02:43:23,948
You know, one of the technology centers that I worked in a lot of work on.

1927
02:43:24,890 --> 02:43:32,538
was both drone automation technology, as well as IoT, or so-called Internet of Things tech.

1928
02:43:32,894 --> 02:43:37,696
And then for a darker period, blockchain and DLT stuff, which is terrible, but that's not relevant.

1929
02:43:38,996 --> 02:43:58,384
But for those other things, these are technologies that are becoming increasingly important to municipal infrastructures and they need to be accounted for when generating and drafting ordinances and putting into practice plans for infrastructure in ways that we can actually support a digital infrastructure throughout our entire community.

1930
02:43:59,380 --> 02:44:09,486
A number of years ago, Verizon came in and there is a long process related to permitting them to install 5G towers.

1931
02:44:09,947 --> 02:44:16,491
Our council at that time completely dropped the ball on getting anything back from them, unfortunately.

1932
02:44:16,511 --> 02:44:18,212
However,

1933
02:44:19,872 --> 02:44:39,264
That's water under the bridge, but looking forward, I do hope that this council will really take seriously any and every opportunity, however minute, to really look at ways that we can actually control how digital infrastructure is rolled out within our city, because it will happen regardless.

1934
02:44:41,824 --> 02:44:44,046
Seeing the technology firsthand, I know it's gonna happen.

1935
02:44:44,066 --> 02:44:47,368
So it's something we need to like really be proactive on.

1936
02:44:48,028 --> 02:44:48,248
Thanks.

1937
02:44:48,569 --> 02:44:49,089
Thanks, Micah.

1938
02:44:51,390 --> 02:44:56,174
Seeing no further comments, no further hands on Zoom, on the motion, all those in favor.

1939
02:44:57,996 --> 02:45:02,302
motion passes 25 1, 3, 6, offer by Councilor Lemming.

1940
02:45:02,923 --> 02:45:13,838
Whereas Medford's current inclusionary zoning as defined under chapter 94 section 94.8.1.6 states that at least a certain percent of new units have to be affordable as defined under Mass General Law and are tiered as follows.

1941
02:45:14,638 --> 02:45:37,523
10 to 24 lots or units, 10% affordable units, 25 to 49 lots or units, 13% affordable units, 50 or more lots or units, 15% affordable units, and whereas Medford's current policy under 94.18 dictates that if the percentage were not a whole number, it needs to be rounded up, and whereas this creates huge incentives to build the discrete intervals, for instance, strongly incentivizing nine-unit properties but not 10,

1942
02:45:38,383 --> 02:45:48,832
or strongly incentivizing 20-unit properties but not 21, and whereas other communities such as Watertown and Somerville have incentive plans that allow for fractional payments to the Affordable Housing Trust in lieu of affordable units.

1943
02:45:49,433 --> 02:45:53,616
Now, therefore, be it resolved that the City of Benford update its incentive structures to allow fractional payments.

1944
02:45:54,177 --> 02:46:01,003
Be it further resolved that this paper be referred to the Affordable Housing Trust Fund Board for specific recommendations on how to update the above-referenced policies.

1945
02:46:01,523 --> 02:46:05,146
Be it further resolved that this paper be referred to the Administration and Finance Committee for further discussion.

1946
02:46:05,166 --> 02:46:05,987
Councillor Lemming.

1947
02:46:08,498 --> 02:46:08,898
Thank you.

1948
02:46:08,918 --> 02:46:23,852
I think that the text of this resolution really speaks for itself, but this is something that the planning department has long recognized is, and I'd say a flaw in Medford's current

1949
02:46:25,353 --> 02:46:49,644
zoning codes and it's one that they think could be addressed sort of in a vacuum without needing to without it substantially affecting a whole lot of other parts of the code and I think it would also be a good it would also be good to get the affordable housing trust to offer feedback for

1950
02:46:51,458 --> 02:47:15,796
to the city council if we are to update our fractional incentive policies so that they so that it could be a mechanism to actually fund the affordable housing trust but essentially essentially what this does is if you look at medford's current very simple inclusionary zoning that's it as it says in the text of the resolution they sort of have

1951
02:47:17,536 --> 02:47:36,585
they have a policy where developers from a bird's eye view to simplify it, developers can build up to nine units market rate, but then the 10th unit has to be an affordable one.

1952
02:47:36,605 --> 02:47:38,046
There's that like that 10th is a 10%.

1953
02:47:38,947 --> 02:47:45,650
And what this does is it means that Medford has a lot of nine unit properties because suddenly adding on the 10th one would just be a massive

1954
02:47:46,791 --> 02:48:01,440
Josh Triplett And so basically this and so essentially what this would do is it is instead of having these sort of discrete.

1955
02:48:02,060 --> 02:48:12,570
intervals where suddenly between nine and 10, you suddenly get this jump from 0% affordable to 10% affordable, and then this sudden jump at the 24 to 25 number, it would

1956
02:48:23,280 --> 02:48:38,880
sort of have it would you could actually change the policy so that you could make it so that instead of having these intervals you could actually like have the developer pay for part of an affordable unit in lieu of actually making in lieu of actually

1957
02:48:39,380 --> 02:48:44,641
building a unit that is required to be affordable as it's defined under the state.

1958
02:48:45,182 --> 02:49:01,706
So this would basically make it so that Medford doesn't have like so many 24 or so many nine unit properties and developers wouldn't have that weird discretized incentive and also be another mechanism to fund the Affordable Housing Trust.

1959
02:49:01,726 --> 02:49:08,268
But I figured that it would be best left up to the policy wonks that are sitting on the AHT.

1960
02:49:09,528 --> 02:49:15,529
in order to recommend the specifics of what this policy is because that can vary from town to town.

1961
02:49:15,789 --> 02:49:38,234
So the recommendation for this is to send out a request to the AHT asking them to develop a recommendation for how to change this policy that could then be considered in the administration and finance committee where I would also motion to refer this paper to.

1962
02:49:40,657 --> 02:49:41,317
Councilor Callahan.

1963
02:49:42,898 --> 02:49:43,078
Thanks.

1964
02:49:43,118 --> 02:49:44,079
It's a tiny discrepancy.

1965
02:49:44,099 --> 02:49:52,683
I wanted to make sure, um, in this third, whereas you say strongly incentivizing 20 unit properties, but not 21, I assume you mean 24 unit and not 25.

1966
02:49:54,985 --> 02:49:57,026
Thank you.

1967
02:49:58,466 --> 02:50:09,012
Um, if you want to go over it again, Councilor Lemming, but I think this should go to planning and permitting, not to administration and finance, but go ahead.

1968
02:50:09,497 --> 02:50:14,798
Yeah, my logic for that was that planning and permitting seemed to be pretty busy.

1969
02:50:16,519 --> 02:50:18,859
But no, I'd accept that, that's fine.

1970
02:50:18,879 --> 02:50:19,440
Got some time.

1971
02:50:20,100 --> 02:50:24,401
Got some time available.

1972
02:50:24,661 --> 02:50:31,023
Yeah, so motion to, I'll go ahead and amend it in motion to refer to the planning and permitting committee instead.

1973
02:50:32,743 --> 02:50:35,704
On the motion of council, I'm going to refer to the planning and permitting committee seconded by.

1974
02:50:36,902 --> 02:50:37,942
Seconded by Councilor Callahan.

1975
02:50:37,982 --> 02:50:38,643
All those in favor?

1976
02:50:39,623 --> 02:50:39,923
Opposed?

1977
02:50:39,983 --> 02:50:40,803
Motion passes.

1978
02:50:41,944 --> 02:50:43,524
Communications from the Mayor.

1979
02:50:43,544 --> 02:50:45,925
24153 submitted by Mayor Brandon Legault Kern.

1980
02:50:45,945 --> 02:50:48,706
Approval of funding for lot apartment claim over 2,500.

1981
02:50:48,886 --> 02:50:51,827
Judith Dean for $3,448.36.

1982
02:50:52,227 --> 02:50:54,968
I'll go to Solicitor Foley.

1983
02:50:57,188 --> 02:50:57,709
Welcome.

1984
02:50:58,109 --> 02:50:59,209
Members of the City Council.

1985
02:50:59,249 --> 02:51:00,389
My name is Kevin Foley.

1986
02:51:00,469 --> 02:51:02,110
I'm the City Solicitor.

1987
02:51:02,130 --> 02:51:04,791
This is the City Solicitor of the City of Medford.

1988
02:51:07,462 --> 02:51:13,028
So here tonight, seeking approval for a claim over $2,500.

1989
02:51:14,189 --> 02:51:16,211
And this is a claim that has been around for a while.

1990
02:51:16,231 --> 02:51:25,640
It was here long before my time here and was recently brought to my attention by the claimant who has been nothing but polite and persistent.

1991
02:51:27,041 --> 02:51:33,604
The city, from what I understand in reviewing the file on this, took responsibility for this claim.

1992
02:51:34,064 --> 02:51:36,905
It has to do with a sewer backup into her home.

1993
02:51:37,986 --> 02:51:46,269
I listened with interest to city engineer Owen Witella to talk about the water and sewer system.

1994
02:51:46,289 --> 02:51:51,992
So this is an area where the sewer system failed, backed up into this claimant's home.

1995
02:51:52,932 --> 02:51:57,235
And all she is seeking is her actual out-of-pocket costs.

1996
02:51:57,855 --> 02:52:02,158
And I think it was promised to her some time ago that it was going to be brought before this council.

1997
02:52:02,238 --> 02:52:05,760
And for whatever reason, for reasons that I don't know, it didn't happen.

1998
02:52:05,800 --> 02:52:10,183
So I'm bringing it forward now on behalf of the mayor and ask for your approval.

1999
02:52:13,846 --> 02:52:14,106
Great.

2000
02:52:14,466 --> 02:52:16,607
I'll go to Councilor Collins and Councilor Scarapelli.

2001
02:52:16,627 --> 02:52:17,388
Vice President Collins.

2002
02:52:20,426 --> 02:52:21,407
Thank you for being with us tonight.

2003
02:52:21,427 --> 02:52:27,308
I gotta say, I feel for the resident that this happened to.

2004
02:52:29,929 --> 02:52:31,850
And applaud her for her persistence.

2005
02:52:31,890 --> 02:52:35,331
It seems only fair that we try to expedite her being made whole at this juncture.

2006
02:52:35,351 --> 02:52:36,051
I'd motion to approve.

2007
02:52:39,212 --> 02:52:42,493
On the motion of Vice President Collins to approve, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

2008
02:52:42,573 --> 02:52:43,774
Councilor Scarpalli.

2009
02:52:43,814 --> 02:52:44,674
Thank you, Mr. President.

2010
02:52:45,034 --> 02:52:47,515
Thanks Kevin for bringing this forward because this has been so frustrating.

2011
02:52:48,304 --> 02:52:53,367
This has been going on so long, and I know that this resident endured some health.

2012
02:52:53,787 --> 02:53:04,914
And this was approved through KP Law, and then it went through the main office where they didn't know who was doing what, and then it faded away.

2013
02:53:05,074 --> 02:53:12,679
And I know that there's someone in your office that works her tail off, that tried everything she could to make sure this resident was taken care of.

2014
02:53:12,719 --> 02:53:15,561
But I appreciate bringing this forward and finally getting it resolved.

2015
02:53:15,601 --> 02:53:16,621
This is a long time coming.

2016
02:53:16,661 --> 02:53:17,642
So again, thank you very much.

2017
02:53:19,337 --> 02:53:19,697
Thank you.

2018
02:53:19,857 --> 02:53:21,399
On the motion of Vice President Collins.

2019
02:53:25,161 --> 02:53:26,562
Seconded by Councilor Callahan.

2020
02:53:26,582 --> 02:53:29,425
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2021
02:53:32,447 --> 02:53:33,288
Councilor Callahan.

2022
02:53:34,649 --> 02:53:35,349
Vice President Collins.

2023
02:53:35,369 --> 02:53:35,469
Yes.

2024
02:53:36,650 --> 02:53:37,210
Councilor Zara.

2025
02:53:37,231 --> 02:53:37,351
Yes.

2026
02:53:38,411 --> 02:53:38,972
Councilor Lemmie.

2027
02:53:38,992 --> 02:53:39,052
Yes.

2028
02:53:40,313 --> 02:53:40,993
Councilor Scapelli.

2029
02:53:41,013 --> 02:53:41,093
Yes.

2030
02:53:42,054 --> 02:53:42,615
Councilor Singh.

2031
02:53:42,635 --> 02:53:42,695
Yes.

2032
02:53:43,623 --> 02:53:44,264
Thank you very much.

2033
02:53:44,284 --> 02:53:45,145
We'll see you next meeting.

2034
02:53:45,165 --> 02:53:45,526
I don't think so.

2035
02:53:58,271 --> 02:53:59,431
Stick it out, stick it out.

2036
02:53:59,772 --> 02:54:06,874
Well, I thought that, are you taking any action on, because I was looking for a little bit more time on the Human Rights Commission.

2037
02:54:07,454 --> 02:54:08,575
Is that being brought up tonight?

2038
02:54:08,895 --> 02:54:10,355
No, not yet.

2039
02:54:11,336 --> 02:54:12,296
So we'll have a little more time.

2040
02:54:12,316 --> 02:54:14,977
I'm in the infancy of looking at that, but I will look at it.

2041
02:54:15,237 --> 02:54:16,638
Great.

2042
02:54:18,358 --> 02:54:19,499
Thank you very much for having me.

2043
02:54:20,659 --> 02:54:22,240
I think we'll be out of here quickly.

2044
02:54:22,260 --> 02:54:25,181
24.5145 submitted by Mayor Brianna Lago-Kern.

2045
02:54:30,114 --> 02:54:31,775

2046
02:54:31,876 --> 02:54:35,479
Request for a food truck permit for chicken and rice guys, September 25th, 2025.

2047
02:54:37,280 --> 02:54:39,562
Councilor Collins, Councilor Scarpelli, please stop shouting over me.

2048
02:54:43,125 --> 02:54:46,028
Said Councilor Collins, Councilor Scarpelli, please stop shouting over me.

2049
02:54:49,090 --> 02:54:56,917
Dear President Beyers and members of the City Council, on behalf of the below entity, I respectfully submit to the Medford City Council the following request for a food truck permit in the city of Medford.

I don't know what that means, so you should go to the Mystic River Celebration to find it out.

2054
02:55:35,008 --> 02:55:35,448
You want to?

2055
02:55:35,468 --> 02:55:38,189
All right, Councillor Scarpelli.

2056
02:55:38,209 --> 02:55:43,171
Knuckle Bones is a for-profit recreation program that comes out and provides games and activities for residents.

2057
02:55:43,952 --> 02:55:44,192
So.

2058
02:55:45,993 --> 02:55:46,353
Amazing.

2059
02:55:46,553 --> 02:55:47,193
Yeah, that's great.

2060
02:55:47,373 --> 02:55:47,833
Enjoy.

2061
02:55:48,774 --> 02:55:49,394

2068
02:56:28,133 --> 02:56:28,994
Okay, yes.

2069
02:56:29,294 --> 02:56:29,555
All right.

2070
02:56:30,175 --> 02:56:31,157
Polar participation.

2071
02:56:31,257 --> 02:56:34,200
Is there anyone else would like to speak on any topic for three minutes.

2072
02:56:36,222 --> 02:56:37,804
We got one person name and address for the record.

2073
02:56:37,824 --> 02:56:38,505
You have three minutes.

2074
02:56:42,349 --> 02:56:43,511
I was going on zoom.

2075
02:56:44,071 --> 02:56:44,231
It's you.

2076
02:56:49,515 --> 02:56:50,955
Michael Kasselman, 499 Main Street.

2077
02:56:51,196 --> 02:56:54,416
So the reason I came here tonight is I, something's brought to my attention this morning.

2078
02:56:54,436 --> 02:56:57,337
I am sure many of you have already heard about it.

2079
02:56:57,457 --> 02:57:13,042
So the New England Baptist Church, a group that has been a sort of scourge on one of the primary transit ways in our city for a while has come up with this new Fickhock nonsense.

2080
02:57:14,043 --> 02:57:18,474
They have a giant sign that says everything I ever needed to learn about Islam I learned in five minutes on 9-11-2001.

2081
02:57:22,554 --> 02:57:24,114
wildly beyond the pale.

2082
02:57:24,715 --> 02:57:31,877
There not only is this just straight up offensive, I would argue that it is not actually protected speech.

2083
02:57:31,917 --> 02:57:35,298
I think this tows the line well into incitement.

2084
02:57:36,518 --> 02:57:43,160
Regardless, I don't think that there's anything that you can really do as a council, because that would be an enforcement action on the mayor's office.

2085
02:57:43,620 --> 02:57:45,740
And I don't have expectations of her to do anything about that.

2086
02:57:46,761 --> 02:57:51,142
What I would like to see though, is I do think that this council can

2087
02:57:51,817 --> 02:58:01,308
look into putting together a referral packet to send to the IRS to perform an audit of their 501c3 taxes exempt status.

2088
02:58:01,789 --> 02:58:03,531
They are a tax exempt organization.

2089
02:58:03,932 --> 02:58:10,139
However, they can lose that status for doing things like committing

2090
02:58:12,067 --> 02:58:18,709
using inciting language or things that, or making public statements that are generally against the public safety and good.

2091
02:58:19,609 --> 02:58:24,710
It is a lot looser than the actual rules for a finding of incitement.

2092
02:58:26,071 --> 02:58:27,631
This is really egregious though.

2093
02:58:27,811 --> 02:58:36,953
Like I can't say how, I can't understand how egregious this is because there is a mosque less than 300 feet down the street

2094
02:58:40,821 --> 02:58:45,447
It's a Bangladeshi mosque, but I don't think that they understand the differences anyway.

2095
02:58:45,907 --> 02:58:47,889
But anyway, this is crazy.

2096
02:58:48,330 --> 02:59:00,044
And I think a very good rule of thumb is whether or not this is an incitement of violence or begins to get into that line is if you are a measure if you are a mother in a hijab walking

2097
02:59:01,092 --> 02:59:11,115
your child to the mosque and you walk by this sign, would this put you in a reasonable apprehension of fear for your personal safety and the safety of your child?

2098
02:59:11,575 --> 02:59:13,356
I think it very much would.

2099
02:59:14,076 --> 02:59:16,237
This is ridiculous.

2100
02:59:16,817 --> 02:59:18,558
And there needs to be something done about it.

2101
02:59:18,578 --> 02:59:22,579
Like I said, you can't force them to take it down.

2102
02:59:22,599 --> 02:59:24,740
I recognize that.

2103
02:59:25,300 --> 02:59:28,201
But I do think that going after the tax exempt status is

2104
02:59:29,067 --> 02:59:39,464
something absolutely worth doing by this council and something that can be done by this council relatively easily too.

2105
02:59:40,065 --> 02:59:41,908
So that's my public comment.

2106
02:59:45,936 --> 02:59:46,676
You aced it.

2107
02:59:47,597 --> 02:59:50,158
And I just want to say that, yeah, I think the messaging is horrific.

2108
02:59:50,658 --> 02:59:55,521
It's certainly not the first instance of awful, hateful speech that we've seen on that message board.

2109
02:59:55,981 --> 03:00:00,804
And residents have persistently stood up to say that it doesn't represent our community.

2110
03:00:00,884 --> 03:00:03,045
But I understand your position.

2111
03:00:03,285 --> 03:00:07,127
And I'm going to go quickly to Councilor Lemming and then Vice President Collins.

2112
03:00:07,147 --> 03:00:07,648
Councilor Lemming.

2113
03:00:09,208 --> 03:00:09,669
Just a question.

2114
03:00:09,689 --> 03:00:10,189
If you

2115
03:00:14,522 --> 03:00:26,807
Do you know of any other precedent or specific instances of churches having their 513C status revoked for stuff like this?

2116
03:00:26,967 --> 03:00:36,291
I remember the Westboro Baptist Church was in the news for a couple of years for doing stuff like this, but I never really looked into whether they got in trouble with the IRS.

2117
03:00:37,930 --> 03:00:43,853
I so I did not preface this statement with I am a lawyer, because this is way outside of my practice area.

2118
03:00:43,893 --> 03:00:46,194
I don't do most of that or tax law.

2119
03:00:46,654 --> 03:00:49,935
So I don't have any sort of idea.

2120
03:00:50,215 --> 03:00:58,039
I mean, I certainly know that organizations for people speech have been have lost their taxes and status like this.

2121
03:00:58,379 --> 03:00:59,580
It's, you know, speak.

2122
03:01:00,920 --> 03:01:14,786
incitement, specifically incitement, but also just generally stuff that like is in the vicinity of incitement is given as an example by the IRS itself as reasons to actually drop a tax exempt status for an organization.

2123
03:01:15,306 --> 03:01:19,728
So clearly it's happened before, because it's used as like a specific example.

2124
03:01:20,448 --> 03:01:26,071
But yeah, as far as like the case law around it, like that's not something that I know a lot about.

2125
03:01:26,391 --> 03:01:28,452
But I will say that at the end of the day,

2126
03:01:29,792 --> 03:01:41,477
There's a difference between a group of random arbitrary concerned residents putting together a referral, because anyone can refer anyone to the IRS for an audit.

2127
03:01:44,247 --> 03:01:45,689
Arguably, I could go do it myself.

2128
03:01:46,790 --> 03:01:51,915
But having it come from a municipality does give it additional weight.

2129
03:01:52,075 --> 03:01:54,037
And then the IRS makes the ultimate determination.

2130
03:01:54,217 --> 03:01:58,381
So it's not something that like, they're not like spending lawyers on or anything.

2131
03:01:58,441 --> 03:02:00,343
They're spending money on lawyers or anything.

2132
03:02:01,458 --> 03:02:03,759
I don't, I don't, I don't know why, why they do that.

2133
03:02:03,799 --> 03:02:09,342
I mean, they have prime real estate and they put up out a number of inflammatory messages.

2134
03:02:09,402 --> 03:02:21,488
They went to the pride fest, like the Medford's some, some Medford pride events and literally had a fellow out there with a megaphone shouting things across the street.

2135
03:02:25,857 --> 03:02:26,338
It's sad.

2136
03:02:26,358 --> 03:02:41,262
There's like a, when I went to college, there's this guy, I remember UNC Chapel Hill, he was called a pit preacher, and he just, this guy just used to come in the middle of campus and just say the most

2137
03:02:43,114 --> 03:02:45,115
horrific things to college students.

2138
03:02:45,135 --> 03:02:47,675
And it was just something that he just did all the time.

2139
03:02:47,875 --> 03:02:51,156
He would quote the Bible while he was doing it.

2140
03:02:51,516 --> 03:02:58,657
I think he did it to get people's attention, to get a rise out of them, to try to, you know, get attention.

2141
03:02:58,677 --> 03:03:06,939
I don't know if that's the strategy, if that's what this church is going for.

2142
03:03:06,959 --> 03:03:10,800
I think it is not a

2143
03:03:13,258 --> 03:03:16,399
It's something that makes residents feel scared, and I wish they would stop doing it.

2144
03:03:17,039 --> 03:03:18,460
But this does fall under.

2145
03:03:18,480 --> 03:03:23,262
But yeah, that's all I'll say.

2146
03:03:23,282 --> 03:03:24,622
It doesn't make me happy.

2147
03:03:27,443 --> 03:03:27,823
Sorry, Micah.

2148
03:03:27,863 --> 03:03:29,164
I'm going to go to Vice President Collins.

2149
03:03:29,224 --> 03:03:30,084
Vice President Collins.

2150
03:03:31,957 --> 03:03:32,297
Thank you.

2151
03:03:32,377 --> 03:03:36,699
Just really quickly, I just wanted to say thank you for raising this like to the community and also to the council.

2152
03:03:37,219 --> 03:03:50,405
I think it's true, even if this church has completely lost credibility with everybody who isn't a congregant, it is still important for the community and the city to loudly step up and say, wow, like, no, absolutely not.

2153
03:03:51,026 --> 03:03:52,786
They've been pulling this stuff for years.

2154
03:03:52,826 --> 03:03:59,289
This is probably the worst example of hate speech that I've seen from them or anywhere in Medford.

2155
03:03:59,349 --> 03:04:00,570
But still, I think that we should

2156
03:04:01,010 --> 03:04:05,034
do we can do what we can to condemn it because we should just, we should just always do that.

2157
03:04:05,194 --> 03:04:11,159
So thank you again for putting this on our radar and be happy to work with you further to put something on a future city council agenda.

2158
03:04:11,960 --> 03:04:16,744
Thank you.

2159
03:04:17,065 --> 03:04:18,166
We're just gonna we're gonna take it.

2160
03:04:18,226 --> 03:04:19,046
I'm sorry, Micah.

2161
03:04:19,707 --> 03:04:20,127
Thank you.

2162
03:04:20,147 --> 03:04:21,429
I got to respect the rules of this.

2163
03:04:22,449 --> 03:04:23,290
All right.

2164
03:04:24,031 --> 03:04:24,932
Thank you for bringing that up.

2165
03:04:25,112 --> 03:04:26,333
I think we're going to hear more about it.

2166
03:04:27,045 --> 03:04:31,426
I am also hopeful that we will see some of the surrounding businesses and residents.

2167
03:04:32,707 --> 03:04:39,489
You know, we saw the last time a few months ago when they had a sign, Modern Pastry, put up a sign right next to it, directly opposing it.

2168
03:04:39,629 --> 03:04:44,570
That is another way to use speech to counteract speech like this.

2169
03:04:45,671 --> 03:04:47,371
So there's a lot of different approaches that we could take.

2170
03:04:48,472 --> 03:04:49,312
Is there a motion on the floor?

2171
03:04:49,352 --> 03:04:50,492
Is there anyone else like to speak?

2172
03:04:50,932 --> 03:04:52,753
Public participation either in person or on Zoom.

2173
03:04:55,799 --> 03:04:58,220
All right, seeing none, is there a motion on the floor?

2174
03:04:59,181 --> 03:05:03,284
On the motion adjourned by Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Zaro.

2175
03:05:05,105 --> 03:05:05,825
All those in favor?

2176
03:05:06,586 --> 03:05:07,106
Opposed?

2177
03:05:07,266 --> 03:05:08,667
Motion passes and the meeting is adjourned.
