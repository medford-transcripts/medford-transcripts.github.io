1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,804
[SPEAKER_10]: We are calling to order the Medford Community Preservation Committee on Tuesday, October 14, 2025, 6.30 p.m.

2
00:00:04,824 --> 00:00:09,088
[SPEAKER_10]: We are meeting hybrid with some of us being located in room 201 of Medford City Hall and some of us arriving via Zoom.

3
00:00:26,223 --> 00:00:33,668
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, the meeting is recorded and, um, there will be, uh, reporting will be made available as soon as possible afterwards.

4
00:00:33,948 --> 00:00:34,209
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

5
00:00:34,809 --> 00:00:41,954
[SPEAKER_10]: So our agenda this evening is, uh, first of all, I'm going to call roll so that we know who we have here in the committee members.

6
00:00:42,154 --> 00:00:44,195
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll start with the people in room 201.

7
00:00:44,556 --> 00:00:44,876
[SPEAKER_10]: Reg.

8
00:00:44,896 --> 00:00:45,376
[SPEAKER_10]: Here.

9
00:00:45,836 --> 00:00:46,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Rosa.

10
00:00:47,157 --> 00:00:47,397
[SPEAKER_10]: Ada.

11
00:00:47,518 --> 00:00:47,798
[SPEAKER_10]: Here.

12
00:00:48,658 --> 00:00:49,839
[SPEAKER_10]: And online we have Doug.

13
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:50,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Here.

14
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,061
[SPEAKER_10]: Jeremy.

15
00:00:52,661 --> 00:00:52,941
[SPEAKER_14]: Here.

16
00:00:54,022 --> 00:00:54,642
[SPEAKER_10]: Mylesha.

17
00:00:55,383 --> 00:00:55,523
Here.

18
00:00:56,444 --> 00:00:56,864
[SPEAKER_10]: Haley?

19
00:00:57,324 --> 00:00:57,604
[SPEAKER_10]: Here.

20
00:00:58,785 --> 00:01:00,205
[SPEAKER_10]: We know that we're missing Joan.

21
00:01:00,245 --> 00:01:01,346
[SPEAKER_10]: Are we missing anyone else?

22
00:01:01,806 --> 00:01:02,046
[SPEAKER_10]: Ari.

23
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:03,266
[SPEAKER_10]: And Ari.

24
00:01:04,266 --> 00:01:04,687
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

25
00:01:05,487 --> 00:01:18,031
[SPEAKER_10]: So the agenda for this evening is to listen to presentations from half of our applicants for the FY26 funding round.

26
00:01:19,591 --> 00:01:25,453
[SPEAKER_10]: We've received, what, like 12 applications, something like that?

27
00:01:26,142 --> 00:01:26,602
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, 14.

28
00:01:28,023 --> 00:01:28,803
[SPEAKER_10]: 14 applications.

29
00:01:28,983 --> 00:01:34,665
[SPEAKER_10]: So more applications than we are able to schedule presentations in one evening.

30
00:01:35,265 --> 00:01:46,909
[SPEAKER_10]: So what we're going to be doing is listening to presentations, give us an introduction, and maybe three to five minutes of

31
00:01:49,383 --> 00:02:12,414
[SPEAKER_10]: of explanation of your project and then committee members will ask questions and that will give us information so that next month, actually in December, the committee can get back together again and start to process all of that information that we heard of this presentation and to deliberate.

32
00:02:13,575 --> 00:02:18,117
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there anything else that I need to add before we get started with our presentations?

33
00:02:19,509 --> 00:02:20,809
[SPEAKER_07]: Just one quick note.

34
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,350
[SPEAKER_07]: Nevermind, I did take it off.

35
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:27,611
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, there was an application that we were going to hear tonight.

36
00:02:27,711 --> 00:02:29,811
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought I had left it on there, but nevermind.

37
00:02:29,851 --> 00:02:32,172
[SPEAKER_07]: That's been postponed to November.

38
00:02:32,192 --> 00:02:34,032
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think we're good.

39
00:02:34,272 --> 00:02:34,572
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

40
00:02:35,232 --> 00:02:37,433
[SPEAKER_07]: So should I go in the order?

41
00:02:37,453 --> 00:02:38,873
[SPEAKER_07]: I think so, yes.

42
00:02:39,233 --> 00:02:39,613
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

43
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:43,854
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have Veterans Affairs Director Veronica Shaw.

44
00:02:44,014 --> 00:02:44,695
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on down.

45
00:02:44,715 --> 00:02:45,855
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to come right up on here?

46
00:02:46,115 --> 00:02:46,235
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

47
00:02:49,847 --> 00:02:57,950
[SPEAKER_06]: And for that application information here, we just want to talk to you.

48
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:58,790
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

49
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,051
[SPEAKER_06]: She's better than me, folks.

50
00:03:00,091 --> 00:03:01,871
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are both fantastic.

51
00:03:20,257 --> 00:03:22,038
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, so I am Veronica Shaw.

52
00:03:22,178 --> 00:03:24,819
[SPEAKER_21]: I am the Director of Veterans Services for the City.

53
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:30,963
[SPEAKER_21]: My office is in the Arctic tundra.

54
00:03:32,024 --> 00:03:40,649
[SPEAKER_21]: So my request is for funding to fix the Angel of Victory and Peace that is in Oak Grove Cemetery.

55
00:03:40,669 --> 00:03:46,072
[SPEAKER_21]: She is the fountain that overlooks the World War II section.

56
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,781
[SPEAKER_21]: There she is.

57
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:49,961
[SPEAKER_21]: And you have a picture of her.

58
00:03:49,981 --> 00:03:52,483
[SPEAKER_21]: So I took this picture on Memorial Day.

59
00:03:53,263 --> 00:03:57,746
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's significant because you see in the picture that she is full.

60
00:03:57,766 --> 00:03:58,966
[SPEAKER_21]: Her fountain is full.

61
00:03:59,446 --> 00:04:00,267
[SPEAKER_21]: She is pumping.

62
00:04:00,287 --> 00:04:11,833
[SPEAKER_21]: However, it is all artificial because when they built the section behind her, the drainage system was destroyed.

63
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:16,296
[SPEAKER_21]: And so the angel is no longer a functioning fountain.

64
00:04:19,785 --> 00:04:22,507
[SPEAKER_21]: So I just want to give you a little bit of background.

65
00:04:22,587 --> 00:04:32,734
[SPEAKER_21]: So the angel was created and dedicated by Emilius Ciampa, who was a World War I veteran and a Medford resident.

66
00:04:33,135 --> 00:04:39,119
[SPEAKER_21]: He was actually born in Italy and came over.

67
00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:46,925
[SPEAKER_21]: He is also the same creator of the World War I statue that is in the World War I section.

68
00:04:47,612 --> 00:04:51,454
[SPEAKER_21]: He also did some other plaques that are in the Chevalier Theatre.

69
00:04:53,695 --> 00:04:57,696
[SPEAKER_21]: And he and actually Chevalier were in one together.

70
00:04:59,077 --> 00:05:02,578
[SPEAKER_21]: So the angel actually stopped working more than 37 years ago.

71
00:05:02,618 --> 00:05:04,139
[SPEAKER_21]: We don't have an exact date.

72
00:05:05,019 --> 00:05:14,323
[SPEAKER_21]: We're basing that off of when Steve Brogan, who is the caretaker, when he started working, he's been there 37 years, he said she has not been working since he's been here.

73
00:05:15,777 --> 00:05:22,843
[SPEAKER_21]: So what needs to happen for her is first, this is not a maintenance request.

74
00:05:22,943 --> 00:05:25,004
[SPEAKER_21]: We're not asking for funds to keep her up.

75
00:05:25,385 --> 00:05:27,786
[SPEAKER_21]: We're just asking for funds to get her working.

76
00:05:28,867 --> 00:05:33,711
[SPEAKER_21]: Funds for maintenance will come from my budget and from DPW.

77
00:05:34,572 --> 00:05:41,697
[SPEAKER_21]: So what we need are is the funds to actually get her insides working and the drainage and the plumbing outside of the common market.

78
00:05:45,438 --> 00:05:48,841
[SPEAKER_21]: She needs a new filtration system and a new drainage system.

79
00:05:49,241 --> 00:05:55,806
[SPEAKER_21]: And I have included in her packets the proposal from the company that we have found to do the work.

80
00:05:56,967 --> 00:05:58,909
[SPEAKER_07]: And for those folks, I'm sorry to interrupt.

81
00:05:58,949 --> 00:05:59,409
[SPEAKER_07]: No, go ahead.

82
00:05:59,689 --> 00:06:02,492
[SPEAKER_07]: That is in the Dropbox meeting packet as well.

83
00:06:02,832 --> 00:06:04,133
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can follow along there.

84
00:06:04,313 --> 00:06:07,836
[SPEAKER_07]: I can drop the link in the chat if that's helpful.

85
00:06:08,536 --> 00:06:10,678
[SPEAKER_21]: And so what the total, and you have

86
00:06:11,474 --> 00:06:15,095
[SPEAKER_21]: Also, in my application, we're asking for a total of $193,000.

87
00:06:15,436 --> 00:06:23,498
[SPEAKER_21]: That does include a contingency for any increase to materials that we did need.

88
00:06:23,518 --> 00:06:27,680
[SPEAKER_21]: It is a significant amount, but this is sort of a one and done.

89
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:28,800
[SPEAKER_21]: We've got it from there.

90
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:33,022
[SPEAKER_21]: Once she is fixed, we will take over her maintenance every year.

91
00:06:34,262 --> 00:06:38,004
[SPEAKER_21]: And so I think I really want to focus on why this is important.

92
00:06:38,184 --> 00:06:39,124
[SPEAKER_21]: I know that when you

93
00:06:40,377 --> 00:06:43,659
[SPEAKER_21]: People go into the cemetery and say, oh, it's a really pretty angel.

94
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,821
[SPEAKER_21]: But it's what she represents.

95
00:06:46,121 --> 00:06:56,769
[SPEAKER_21]: For me as a veteran, when I walk in there, it's like seeing all of our veterans being recognized.

96
00:06:57,109 --> 00:06:58,731
[SPEAKER_21]: She's there as a symbol.

97
00:06:58,871 --> 00:07:01,773
[SPEAKER_21]: I have courage, sacrifice, and community pride.

98
00:07:02,774 --> 00:07:05,716
[SPEAKER_21]: Champis was a Medford resident.

99
00:07:05,776 --> 00:07:07,037
[SPEAKER_21]: He was a World War I hero.

100
00:07:09,243 --> 00:07:15,105
[SPEAKER_21]: And he created this statue, this fountain, to honor all of us, all of the veterans from Medford.

101
00:07:16,806 --> 00:07:18,506
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a legacy worth preserving.

102
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:26,549
[SPEAKER_21]: When she goes, there's nothing left in that cemetery to watch over our veterans.

103
00:07:27,049 --> 00:07:28,930
[SPEAKER_21]: And she is, she's watching over them.

104
00:07:32,651 --> 00:07:34,392
[SPEAKER_21]: She's a symbol of remembrance.

105
00:07:35,552 --> 00:07:37,933
[SPEAKER_21]: For me, as part of my job is,

106
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:43,021
[SPEAKER_21]: I work alongside Steve to take care of the veterans' graves.

107
00:07:43,742 --> 00:07:50,924
[SPEAKER_21]: And one of the things I spoke about several times over the past two years that I've been here is remembering our veterans.

108
00:07:51,564 --> 00:07:54,045
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not a one day a year.

109
00:07:54,225 --> 00:07:58,506
[SPEAKER_21]: It's an ongoing thing that we need to be remembering our veterans every single day.

110
00:07:58,526 --> 00:08:04,848
[SPEAKER_21]: And having her working is just another way of people being able to drive by and say, yep,

111
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:06,424
[SPEAKER_21]: Those are our veterans.

112
00:08:06,824 --> 00:08:08,645
[SPEAKER_21]: They're what make Medford proud.

113
00:08:10,466 --> 00:08:13,548
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's a matter of respect.

114
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:19,892
[SPEAKER_21]: We come in there every year to do our ceremony, and I'm over there every month doing my walkthroughs.

115
00:08:20,473 --> 00:08:21,754
[SPEAKER_21]: It's just a matter of respect.

116
00:08:21,914 --> 00:08:25,616
[SPEAKER_21]: She hasn't worked in at least 37 years.

117
00:08:25,636 --> 00:08:31,240
[SPEAKER_21]: A veteran created her for Medford, and she's not working.

118
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:37,192
[SPEAKER_21]: And so I am asking for the funds to get her working to make Medford proud and make our veterans proud.

119
00:08:39,713 --> 00:08:40,273
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

120
00:08:40,293 --> 00:08:41,534
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

121
00:08:41,714 --> 00:08:44,495
[SPEAKER_10]: Are there questions, comments from committee members?

122
00:08:48,196 --> 00:08:48,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Kaylee.

123
00:08:50,117 --> 00:08:51,077
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for that presentation.

124
00:08:51,117 --> 00:08:51,837
[SPEAKER_05]: That was really nice.

125
00:08:52,597 --> 00:08:55,158
[SPEAKER_05]: I live in the neighborhood, and I walk through the cemetery all the time.

126
00:08:55,318 --> 00:08:57,639
[SPEAKER_05]: And I always notice that statue, and I always wonder why it's not working.

127
00:08:57,739 --> 00:08:58,600
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was very informative.

128
00:09:00,071 --> 00:09:02,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you get any other prices?

129
00:09:02,493 --> 00:09:04,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you just get that one contractor?

130
00:09:04,594 --> 00:09:09,497
[SPEAKER_21]: So we just got this one because it's a specialist that needs to do it.

131
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,538
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, I could do.

132
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:24,267
[SPEAKER_21]: So this is a specialist that deals exclusively with restoration projects and water fixtures.

133
00:09:24,587 --> 00:09:29,310
[SPEAKER_21]: So this was these people have worked with the city before on other

134
00:09:30,395 --> 00:09:30,995
[SPEAKER_21]: project.

135
00:09:31,015 --> 00:09:35,078
[SPEAKER_21]: So this was who Steve chose to go with.

136
00:09:36,198 --> 00:09:36,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

137
00:09:36,418 --> 00:09:40,821
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, obviously there's a lot of value in going with the professional and somebody who knows it and will do the job right.

138
00:09:40,841 --> 00:09:43,702
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just asking because it is pretty pricey.

139
00:09:44,943 --> 00:09:53,268
[SPEAKER_05]: And as a public entity, you know, I don't know, is the city required to get other pricing or a couple of different proposals or?

140
00:09:54,155 --> 00:09:55,336
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, this would be a bidding.

141
00:09:55,356 --> 00:09:58,918
[SPEAKER_07]: This would go to public bidding, anything over $100,000, actually over $50,000.

142
00:09:58,959 --> 00:09:59,619
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, OK.

143
00:09:59,639 --> 00:09:59,759
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

144
00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:01,180
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is just an estimate.

145
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, perfect.

146
00:10:10,448 --> 00:10:12,330
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, no, this is a great project, obviously.

147
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:18,654
[SPEAKER_13]: I lived in Madrid a long time, never saw that found in action, and I'm definitely older than 35 years for sure.

148
00:10:20,496 --> 00:10:23,178
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a drawing or a photo that shows a little bit more detail?

149
00:10:23,198 --> 00:10:24,198
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't see it in the package.

150
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:32,044
[SPEAKER_13]: I see a very detailed description of the PVC and all the pieces, but sometimes a photo is worth a thousand words.

151
00:10:32,084 --> 00:10:33,205
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there something there you could share?

152
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:36,922
[SPEAKER_21]: I have it in the back of your bag, yes.

153
00:10:36,942 --> 00:10:37,082
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, OK.

154
00:10:37,142 --> 00:10:37,482
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

155
00:10:37,522 --> 00:10:37,962
Maybe.

156
00:10:38,823 --> 00:10:39,743
[SPEAKER_21]: I can email it.

157
00:10:39,903 --> 00:10:43,585
[SPEAKER_21]: It actually was included in with the photo that I used.

158
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:43,685
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

159
00:10:43,745 --> 00:10:47,826
[SPEAKER_07]: It was in with what Weston and Samson's did, like a schematic.

160
00:10:48,687 --> 00:10:49,147
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.

161
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:50,407
[SPEAKER_13]: But that's just the pump.

162
00:10:50,427 --> 00:10:53,809
[SPEAKER_13]: Does it show the whole assembly with the photo?

163
00:10:55,189 --> 00:10:57,070
[SPEAKER_13]: There's no renderings, right, or this, or anything like that?

164
00:10:59,891 --> 00:11:00,891
[SPEAKER_07]: No renderings.

165
00:11:03,425 --> 00:11:10,792
[SPEAKER_21]: This is... Oh, I mean, I'm... You're going to have to jot that down for me.

166
00:11:10,852 --> 00:11:13,214
[SPEAKER_21]: What are you asking for rendering stuff?

167
00:11:13,395 --> 00:11:18,039
[SPEAKER_13]: I see, like, even an eye-level photo of what's there.

168
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,883
[SPEAKER_13]: But that's just the schematic, like, what it's going to look like.

169
00:11:22,864 --> 00:11:24,145
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, you won't see anything.

170
00:11:24,205 --> 00:11:25,607
[SPEAKER_21]: It's all going to be underground.

171
00:11:26,077 --> 00:11:30,821
[SPEAKER_21]: So the inside of the fountain is inside the statue itself.

172
00:11:30,841 --> 00:11:38,228
[SPEAKER_21]: So you won't, the average person is not going to visually see anything other than her working.

173
00:11:38,548 --> 00:11:40,570
[SPEAKER_21]: They're going to have to dig underneath.

174
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:50,980
[SPEAKER_21]: So there's a section of the cemetery kind of catty corner to behind the statue where there's nothing there yet.

175
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,341
[SPEAKER_21]: And so they will have to dig a whole new drainage system behind her.

176
00:11:56,361 --> 00:12:02,622
[SPEAKER_21]: And so you, at the end of the day, nobody should actually see anything.

177
00:12:02,642 --> 00:12:06,363
[SPEAKER_21]: So are you saying like near the tree here is where?

178
00:12:06,383 --> 00:12:09,003
[SPEAKER_21]: It should come, so these are all graves.

179
00:12:09,063 --> 00:12:09,243
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

180
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:17,024
[SPEAKER_21]: And that was what happens when they, when they were digging these graves, they cut off her drainage to this down here.

181
00:12:17,044 --> 00:12:20,345
[SPEAKER_21]: So they're gonna have to come up this way to avoid all of those

182
00:12:20,695 --> 00:12:25,237
[SPEAKER_21]: Because what happens is when you pump water through granges, things come up that shouldn't be coming up.

183
00:12:25,777 --> 00:12:26,077
[SPEAKER_21]: Fair.

184
00:12:27,057 --> 00:12:30,559
[SPEAKER_21]: And so that's literally, they're going to have to drain her out here.

185
00:12:30,859 --> 00:12:30,959
[SPEAKER_21]: OK.

186
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:44,124
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to ask, have you had an assessment of what repair is needed to the statue?

187
00:12:44,144 --> 00:12:47,745
[SPEAKER_21]: That is what is in the proposal.

188
00:12:48,261 --> 00:12:52,204
[SPEAKER_21]: if they know exactly what needs to be done, because they've looked at it before.

189
00:12:52,224 --> 00:12:52,264
[SPEAKER_21]: OK.

190
00:12:52,284 --> 00:12:54,225
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

191
00:12:54,345 --> 00:12:55,526
[SPEAKER_21]: Reg?

192
00:12:55,606 --> 00:13:00,789
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that I read in your application was that they don't do removal.

193
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:10,636
[SPEAKER_02]: So if they do have to get up underneath there and dig and so on and so forth, and there's excess gravel, dirt, whatever, rocks, what have you, they won't remove it.

194
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:16,260
[SPEAKER_02]: I would respectfully think that we would probably

195
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:26,369
[SPEAKER_02]: talk to whoever we get the bidding from, that stuff be removed, because it has to be cleaned up so that it looks like it does now.

196
00:13:26,469 --> 00:13:27,229
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

197
00:13:27,309 --> 00:13:33,510
[SPEAKER_21]: Rather than, you know, with a pile of... Well, the landscaping is included.

198
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:35,151
[SPEAKER_21]: They would landscape over it.

199
00:13:35,191 --> 00:13:39,952
[SPEAKER_21]: But yes, whoever ends up doing the work, of course, would have to remove any debris.

200
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,332
[SPEAKER_02]: And they didn't put that in their proposal, though.

201
00:13:44,192 --> 00:13:45,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Just let me know.

202
00:13:45,893 --> 00:13:46,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

203
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:49,205
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

204
00:13:49,385 --> 00:13:51,266
[SPEAKER_06]: Are there other questions from committee members?

205
00:13:51,286 --> 00:13:59,449
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, thank you very much for your presentation.

206
00:13:59,469 --> 00:14:09,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

207
00:14:10,813 --> 00:14:14,995
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would remind everyone that there are snacks

208
00:14:17,878 --> 00:14:23,322
[SPEAKER_10]: and invite our next presentation, which is Shiloh Baptist Church.

209
00:14:27,704 --> 00:14:35,409
[SPEAKER_10]: I do appreciate your coming to sit at the table because that way the folks online can see you just as well as we in the room can see you.

210
00:14:35,429 --> 00:14:39,011
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want to sit here, sir?

211
00:14:39,031 --> 00:14:41,792
[SPEAKER_03]: I can stand for a while.

212
00:14:41,972 --> 00:14:43,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, up to you.

213
00:14:43,653 --> 00:14:44,274
[SPEAKER_03]: That works too?

214
00:14:44,743 --> 00:14:45,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Great to be back.

215
00:14:46,304 --> 00:14:56,047
[SPEAKER_03]: We have had an opportunity to come before the committee on another effort, which is ongoing right now, which is the daycare center that's moving right along.

216
00:14:56,707 --> 00:15:00,548
[SPEAKER_03]: And we appreciate all that you've done to make that work for us.

217
00:15:01,669 --> 00:15:11,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, Shiloh started out on this mission before, repairing the windows on the east side and all around the entire church.

218
00:15:11,372 --> 00:15:14,313
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have a preliminary survey that covers

219
00:15:14,894 --> 00:15:25,642
[SPEAKER_03]: all that, and what today we want to emphasize is the eastern side of the church, which is this Palladium window that you see there.

220
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:43,175
[SPEAKER_03]: The Palladium window is probably a beautiful architectural feature that people see as they pass by the church, and it's probably one of the things that is most in danger of having leaves falling.

221
00:15:43,195 --> 00:15:43,235
So

222
00:15:44,801 --> 00:15:53,583
[SPEAKER_03]: We would like to make sure that the architect which we had on board before had surveyed this and resurveyed this item.

223
00:15:54,523 --> 00:16:13,787
[SPEAKER_03]: And that actually would take some of that money and emphasize shoring or meeting the historical code to make sure the window stays in place as we gather more money to replace or to put the church plating window back into shape.

224
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:22,955
[SPEAKER_03]: because there's millions of dollars in terms of all of, if we were to do all the windows, but that eastern side is what we want to emphasize.

225
00:16:24,236 --> 00:16:26,756
[SPEAKER_03]: And it also enhances the community.

226
00:16:27,377 --> 00:16:42,481
[SPEAKER_03]: The people who live around there, walk by the church, and see the church, see this church as a negative, if the windows are not pretty, as well as any

227
00:16:43,698 --> 00:16:57,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Religious features of this church, we'll make sure to accommodate either we place them with other stained glass that have no religious emphasis, or we pay for that ourselves.

228
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:10,679
[SPEAKER_03]: So we want to gather funds, additional funds beyond what we think that that will work, plus what you're contributing if you so find that we will be granted them.

229
00:17:11,538 --> 00:17:13,660
[SPEAKER_03]: $150,000 to do this work.

230
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:22,546
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the emphasis of this today, is to emphasize the Palladium window and the windows that are adjacent to that.

231
00:17:22,566 --> 00:17:27,409
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you have one.

232
00:17:27,509 --> 00:17:29,510
[SPEAKER_03]: If this picture right here, probably down here.

233
00:17:29,931 --> 00:17:30,351
[SPEAKER_03]: See these?

234
00:17:30,771 --> 00:17:32,152
[SPEAKER_03]: There's two adjacent windows.

235
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:36,475
[SPEAKER_03]: But the main window is this feature, this architectural feature.

236
00:17:37,095 --> 00:17:40,798
[SPEAKER_03]: On the more northerly side, that is in good order.

237
00:17:41,756 --> 00:17:45,577
[SPEAKER_03]: compared to what it is to the other church windows.

238
00:17:45,877 --> 00:17:52,958
[SPEAKER_03]: And on the other side, it's very—I haven't had some of that work done on it before, on the second floor.

239
00:17:52,978 --> 00:18:10,182
[SPEAKER_03]: So we just want to put the church into a more environmentally positive feature, so that we don't have heat loss, as well as we keep the architectural feature of that church in good order for the local community to enjoy.

240
00:18:10,966 --> 00:18:15,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the church does serve many other things besides a religious order.

241
00:18:15,287 --> 00:18:16,407
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a gathering space.

242
00:18:17,207 --> 00:18:22,529
[SPEAKER_03]: We're probably entertaining some other community efforts there.

243
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:25,309
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's my position right now.

244
00:18:26,509 --> 00:18:27,790
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

245
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:33,771
[SPEAKER_10]: Questions from the committee members?

246
00:18:37,974 --> 00:18:42,357
[SPEAKER_10]: I would just like to comment that, oh, yes, Jeremy.

247
00:18:44,978 --> 00:18:45,759
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

248
00:18:46,099 --> 00:18:47,180
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the presentation.

249
00:18:47,640 --> 00:19:02,749
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just curious, I'm looking at the information provided, maybe this is a question for Teresa as well, but is there a quote from a contractor or any other documentation of the cost that's requested here?

250
00:19:02,849 --> 00:19:05,051
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry if I missed that when you were speaking.

251
00:19:07,122 --> 00:19:10,284
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, there should be in the meeting packet.

252
00:19:10,464 --> 00:19:12,025
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got an estimate.

253
00:19:12,165 --> 00:19:13,125
[SPEAKER_07]: It was from 2022.

254
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:22,330
[SPEAKER_07]: So to Mr. McIntyre's point, it needs to get kind of revisited for pricing, but we do have a sense of what the cost would be here.

255
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:26,652
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there's a technical glitch on my end, Teresa.

256
00:19:26,672 --> 00:19:28,373
[SPEAKER_00]: I only see the application.

257
00:19:28,393 --> 00:19:29,893
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

258
00:19:31,774 --> 00:19:34,435
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be curious to read through that.

259
00:19:35,853 --> 00:19:37,574
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

260
00:19:38,214 --> 00:19:52,558
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that when they prepared their very first application for us, I helped them gather, I think, a second, which would also be a couple of years old.

261
00:19:53,379 --> 00:20:02,822
[SPEAKER_10]: But the architect's information might also help to provide an estimate of cost.

262
00:20:06,192 --> 00:20:10,513
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, this was, I think, the one that they had gathered before I started working with them.

263
00:20:11,313 --> 00:20:14,354
[SPEAKER_10]: So there might be another one in the first application.

264
00:20:14,394 --> 00:20:19,356
[SPEAKER_10]: We could look through that material and see if there are some comparables.

265
00:20:20,816 --> 00:20:31,139
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a spreadsheet that shows the estimated current estimate costs, escalations from the last three years, and then contingency?

266
00:20:31,199 --> 00:20:32,499
[SPEAKER_13]: I missed that too, if that's in there.

267
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:34,780
[SPEAKER_10]: I think one thing

268
00:20:35,857 --> 00:20:45,103
[SPEAKER_10]: that we want to, okay so this itemizes by window because the church has 40 stained glass windows in it.

269
00:20:45,123 --> 00:21:01,215
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really incredible and they're all beautiful and most of them have geometric designs that are not religious so they are, it would be possible to be able to put

270
00:21:02,683 --> 00:21:05,904
[SPEAKER_10]: um, public funding into preserving them.

271
00:21:07,985 --> 00:21:20,650
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's, that would be the, what it would cost to restore all of those windows is more, you know, it would require several phases of funding because that's a very big project.

272
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:27,753
[SPEAKER_10]: So I appreciate that their architect asked them to, um, prioritize

273
00:21:28,863 --> 00:21:34,904
[SPEAKER_10]: That one, the palladium window and the ones on the east side of the sanctuary space.

274
00:21:35,164 --> 00:21:41,866
[SPEAKER_10]: So that those are the windows that are the highest priority to address in phase 1.

275
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:45,546
[SPEAKER_10]: So, D1, C1 and D2.

276
00:21:45,606 --> 00:21:45,927
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

277
00:22:05,268 --> 00:22:09,850
[SPEAKER_07]: The rough cost for the C1, which was the palladium window, 56.

278
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:14,591
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the side light pieces are 48.

279
00:22:14,731 --> 00:22:20,553
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, this is 2022.

280
00:22:20,613 --> 00:22:28,436
[SPEAKER_07]: There is another price estimate to look at, but just to kind of get some sense of what pricing was three plus years ago.

281
00:22:32,197 --> 00:22:37,699
[SPEAKER_03]: So that would really have a tremendous improvement to the community's spirit.

282
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:45,242
[SPEAKER_03]: The congregation certainly would be benefiting, as well as its loss of heat would be much less.

283
00:22:45,462 --> 00:22:45,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

284
00:22:45,923 --> 00:22:56,387
[SPEAKER_03]: So the number of things that follow environmentally as well as enhances the community who have put a significant amount of money in their own properties.

285
00:22:56,987 --> 00:22:59,208
[SPEAKER_03]: So they'd like to follow.

286
00:22:59,248 --> 00:23:00,688
[SPEAKER_03]: We have some great neighbors there.

287
00:23:02,888 --> 00:23:12,934
[SPEAKER_10]: I would heartily encourage you to ask your neighbors to contribute to the fund for the windows.

288
00:23:13,574 --> 00:23:20,178
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a QR that we started for separate funding and held that funding in place.

289
00:23:20,658 --> 00:23:26,642
[SPEAKER_03]: We really haven't placed a lot of emphasis on that because we were doing with the other project that was working there.

290
00:23:27,162 --> 00:23:30,624
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's coming along and it should be out of our here.

291
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:32,778
[SPEAKER_03]: by January 26.

292
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:47,082
[SPEAKER_03]: So that the church and its membership could make a strong emphasis, the trustee board would be particularly interested in making a main focus to raise more funds to supplement whatever we achieved here.

293
00:23:48,362 --> 00:23:53,643
[SPEAKER_10]: I would love to see that because the only religious panels in the whole building

294
00:23:54,396 --> 00:23:58,139
[SPEAKER_10]: are little tiny pieces within that Palladian window.

295
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:05,505
[SPEAKER_10]: So it would be really helpful to see the private match to this project specifically.

296
00:24:05,525 --> 00:24:21,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, because currently we have something like three or four thousand dollars actually set aside for people who have walked by and contributed to the church, and the QR.

297
00:24:21,257 --> 00:24:23,159
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was just basically

298
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,980
[SPEAKER_03]: not a very strong effort.

299
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:29,482
[SPEAKER_13]: Look, this is an incredibly important church architecturally.

300
00:24:29,502 --> 00:24:30,622
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm on the historic commission.

301
00:24:30,642 --> 00:24:33,143
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that we think this is a significant building.

302
00:24:33,183 --> 00:24:35,704
[SPEAKER_13]: You mentioned something comparable to that in the application.

303
00:24:35,784 --> 00:24:38,404
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is all heading in the right direction.

304
00:24:38,444 --> 00:24:50,228
[SPEAKER_13]: The only question I have about this is that many, many times, if not most times, when I hear about historic buildings getting window restoration, usually there's

305
00:24:51,078 --> 00:24:56,439
[SPEAKER_13]: an attempt to not just, because all there is, is this window.

306
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,900
[SPEAKER_13]: There's no outside window or inside window.

307
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:10,602
[SPEAKER_13]: There's this one plane of stained glass and lead between a zero degree day on the outside in the winter and a 68 degree heated interior for this project.

308
00:25:11,222 --> 00:25:13,883
[SPEAKER_13]: Are we not, as part of this restoration, we're not putting anything

309
00:25:14,924 --> 00:25:22,481
[SPEAKER_13]: on the to make the building more weather tight to make it, I guess,

310
00:25:23,529 --> 00:25:24,690
[SPEAKER_13]: hopefully preserve it for longer.

311
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:32,115
[SPEAKER_13]: We've seen that on other window restoration projects, Roberta and Teresa, I think in Chevalier and maybe a couple of other ones.

312
00:25:33,556 --> 00:25:41,362
[SPEAKER_13]: I know we did it in the Brooks Estate, but they were much smaller windows because we have interior storm windows there, which is often to maintain the exterior look.

313
00:25:41,422 --> 00:25:47,886
[SPEAKER_13]: So is there anything under consideration for that aspect of this or is that simply not part of this project?

314
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:59,484
[SPEAKER_03]: inviting that we look at that much more farther, because we do have an architect on board who's actually very familiar with this church.

315
00:26:00,264 --> 00:26:01,645
[SPEAKER_03]: So that would be helpful.

316
00:26:01,745 --> 00:26:10,311
[SPEAKER_03]: He could certainly point out other alternatives, whether it's a storm window or some type that would be good inside.

317
00:26:10,831 --> 00:26:17,676
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen this operation where they put them on the outside and it causes more problems for condensation.

318
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:26,679
[SPEAKER_03]: But if it's in the interior and it's much better for heat loss, that's a number one thing for today.

319
00:26:26,699 --> 00:26:28,423
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to get the heat loss done.

320
00:26:29,058 --> 00:26:35,482
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I think without something on the inside, I think the heat loss will still be pretty significant, even with the important restoration work that's being done.

321
00:26:36,222 --> 00:26:49,190
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess I'm encouraging you to think about that to see if there's maybe a little bit more investigation that can be done to see if these windows, again, the scale of these windows are very challenging, especially the arch ones.

322
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:53,212
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, they must be, what, 12, 13 feet wide?

323
00:26:53,252 --> 00:26:54,513
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, they're pretty damn big.

324
00:26:54,893 --> 00:26:57,295
[SPEAKER_13]: The smaller ones, I think, are simpler to tackle.

325
00:26:58,557 --> 00:27:08,265
[SPEAKER_13]: Plus the round shape obviously has its own challenges, but I think it's worth just taking another look and seeing if there's more that can be done.

326
00:27:08,625 --> 00:27:16,491
[SPEAKER_13]: It would cost more, because I don't think that's what your cost estimate is part, is assuming that there's anything on the inside of these windows, right?

327
00:27:17,792 --> 00:27:24,997
[SPEAKER_03]: No, at the present time, I concur with what you're thinking, and so that's invited.

328
00:27:26,574 --> 00:27:29,256
[SPEAKER_03]: and we would talk with the architect about that feature.

329
00:27:30,197 --> 00:27:31,038
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be great.

330
00:27:31,298 --> 00:27:54,877
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you could confirm with Teresa, after you talk with the architect, to ask if the architect has a more current estimate of the cost of restoration for those windows on that section, and to what the architect recommends for weather protection.

331
00:27:55,817 --> 00:28:15,392
[SPEAKER_10]: And so if we have an updated budget before we meet in December, we want to make sure that we're recommending an amount of funding that's sufficient for you to complete the work if the funding is recommended.

332
00:28:16,033 --> 00:28:19,055
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you're able to make sure that you have

333
00:28:19,623 --> 00:28:26,526
[SPEAKER_10]: the scope that you need and the cost estimate that you need for that scope.

334
00:28:27,266 --> 00:28:33,128
[SPEAKER_10]: We will use your new budget to consider the recommendation.

335
00:28:33,168 --> 00:28:33,789
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

336
00:28:33,809 --> 00:28:35,069
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.

337
00:28:35,309 --> 00:28:36,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

338
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:38,391
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll give you a call tomorrow.

339
00:28:38,431 --> 00:28:38,951
[SPEAKER_06]: Maisha?

340
00:28:50,217 --> 00:28:51,657
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I just wanted to add one thing.

341
00:28:51,717 --> 00:28:57,379
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm curious, I don't know if anyone knows, but MassSafe has the rebate program for residential buildings.

342
00:28:57,899 --> 00:29:02,680
[SPEAKER_20]: And I wonder if the church might be able to utilize something from that for commercial buildings as well.

343
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, of course.

344
00:29:04,901 --> 00:29:08,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, sorry, but I'm sorry, I didn't understand.

345
00:29:08,202 --> 00:29:09,862
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all right.

346
00:29:09,962 --> 00:29:11,303
[SPEAKER_03]: But what was the question?

347
00:29:11,703 --> 00:29:12,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

348
00:29:12,123 --> 00:29:16,264
[SPEAKER_20]: I can repeat what I said.

349
00:29:19,823 --> 00:29:24,906
[SPEAKER_20]: Mass Save has residential rebates for window installation and window replacement.

350
00:29:25,427 --> 00:29:30,830
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that they have similar programs for larger buildings that are commercial and non-profit.

351
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:36,833
[SPEAKER_20]: That might be something to look into as well that can help incentivize or rebate any upgrades to the church.

352
00:29:37,854 --> 00:29:39,315
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll follow up on that.

353
00:29:39,755 --> 00:29:40,015
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

354
00:29:40,035 --> 00:29:46,959
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe the architect would also know how to find out about Mass Save rebates.

355
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:47,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

356
00:29:48,935 --> 00:29:50,916
[SPEAKER_07]: Appreciate it.

357
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:52,196
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you both.

358
00:29:52,356 --> 00:29:53,116
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

359
00:29:53,556 --> 00:29:54,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Get home safe.

360
00:29:54,237 --> 00:29:54,637
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

361
00:29:54,697 --> 00:29:57,698
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

362
00:29:58,578 --> 00:30:07,661
[SPEAKER_10]: And next on our projects this evening is Riverside Plaza Shade Improvements Additional Trunch.

363
00:30:10,222 --> 00:30:16,704
[SPEAKER_07]: We are joined by City Planner Amanda Centro from the Office of Planning Development Sustainability.

364
00:30:16,864 --> 00:30:17,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Amanda.

365
00:30:18,198 --> 00:30:18,718
[SPEAKER_16]: You have the floor.

366
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:19,839
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

367
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:20,879
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, everyone.

368
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:25,862
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm Amanda.

369
00:30:25,922 --> 00:30:26,943
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll start with a question.

370
00:30:27,063 --> 00:30:34,126
[SPEAKER_16]: Who here is familiar with the Riverside Shade Improvement Project that was before the CPC last year?

371
00:30:34,146 --> 00:30:35,487
[SPEAKER_16]: If you could raise your hands.

372
00:30:38,148 --> 00:30:40,329
[SPEAKER_16]: OK, so a chunk of you and maybe a few not.

373
00:30:40,369 --> 00:30:41,850
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'll go over a couple of things.

374
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:44,692
[SPEAKER_16]: But is it OK if I share my screen?

375
00:30:45,392 --> 00:30:47,053
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, I believe I just made you a co-host.

376
00:30:47,609 --> 00:30:48,351
[SPEAKER_16]: Amazing.

377
00:30:48,452 --> 00:30:50,918
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, let's take a look here.

378
00:30:56,083 --> 00:30:58,664
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, are we seeing my screen hopefully?

379
00:30:59,345 --> 00:30:59,905
[SPEAKER_06]: We are.

380
00:31:00,345 --> 00:31:01,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

381
00:31:03,047 --> 00:31:15,153
[SPEAKER_16]: So the Riverside Plaza Improvement Project was before the CPC last year, and we were awarded funding as well as a PARC, P-A-R-C, state grant.

382
00:31:16,573 --> 00:31:18,294
[SPEAKER_16]: So just to orient us a little bit,

383
00:31:19,995 --> 00:31:20,895
[SPEAKER_16]: This is the plaza.

384
00:31:20,955 --> 00:31:22,516
[SPEAKER_16]: It's in the heart of Medford Square.

385
00:31:23,196 --> 00:31:39,702
[SPEAKER_16]: It was renovated in, I think, 2018, and it's a great, well-loved, used space, except that there isn't a lot of existing shade within the actual plaza area, or patio area, is what I've been calling it, during the

386
00:31:40,422 --> 00:31:41,622
[SPEAKER_16]: hottest parts of the year.

387
00:31:41,843 --> 00:31:49,325
[SPEAKER_16]: And so it becomes somewhat unusable during peak season in the summer, which is too hot.

388
00:31:49,525 --> 00:32:03,771
[SPEAKER_16]: And so the way that folks tend to use this space, if they're using it on hot days, is to drag some of the mobile chairs and tables under the adjacent lawn area where there's some existing mature trees, which works.

389
00:32:04,111 --> 00:32:08,072
[SPEAKER_16]: But there are some barriers to doing that.

390
00:32:08,132 --> 00:32:09,373
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not an accessible.

391
00:32:10,493 --> 00:32:15,800
[SPEAKER_16]: area that's just, you know, at this point used to be lawn, but is now dirt patching tree roots.

392
00:32:17,041 --> 00:32:24,390
[SPEAKER_16]: And so we thought that we could do some targeted improvements to this area to make it more usable and more climate resilient.

393
00:32:25,697 --> 00:32:48,135
[SPEAKER_16]: So what you all saw last year when we applied is we had these sort of sets of shade sails over here, a deck from the accessible route here with a ramp, and some light bollards that were an ad alternate, so an option if we had the budget for bidding.

394
00:32:48,615 --> 00:32:54,620
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's not actually showed on this picture, but we included in the scope a water bottle filling station.

395
00:32:55,500 --> 00:33:02,789
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, and we went out to bid with this in the spring and unfortunately the bids came back much higher than anticipated.

396
00:33:03,209 --> 00:33:05,351
[SPEAKER_16]: So we had budgeted this around $300,000 and the lowest bid was $600,000.

397
00:33:05,452 --> 00:33:05,612
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, so.

398
00:33:11,459 --> 00:33:30,076
[SPEAKER_16]: We regrouped a bit, met with the bidders to understand what was driving those costs, and also met with our other grant funder, the park grant administrator, to understand what their parameters were for maintaining that funding if we were going to make any adjustments.

399
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:39,830
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm approaching you all today with a revised design scope as well as a request for some contingency funding.

400
00:33:40,871 --> 00:33:54,724
[SPEAKER_16]: The scope still includes shade sails, it adds metal shade umbrellas, a smaller deck footprint but still accessible, a tree relocation, and we maintain that water fountain Bottle Filler station.

401
00:33:56,927 --> 00:33:59,828
[SPEAKER_16]: So here is the revised design scope.

402
00:34:00,968 --> 00:34:04,229
[SPEAKER_16]: You can see here there's existing seating in these two areas.

403
00:34:04,429 --> 00:34:11,232
[SPEAKER_16]: And one of the parameters given by the park grant was that we shade the same areas that we had originally proposed.

404
00:34:11,872 --> 00:34:15,913
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're proposing now to have two shade sails.

405
00:34:16,313 --> 00:34:21,755
[SPEAKER_16]: I've got some pictures to show you that go into the landscaped area over here.

406
00:34:22,475 --> 00:34:35,755
[SPEAKER_16]: we relocate an existing tree from here into this southern portion of the patio, which actually kind of better situates it for more optimally shading the patio.

407
00:34:35,775 --> 00:34:37,577
[SPEAKER_16]: This is in the south part of it.

408
00:34:38,238 --> 00:34:57,714
[SPEAKER_16]: And then we have two commercial outdoor surface mounted shade umbrellas to further provide shade to the seating, and a shortened deck footprint, as well as the water bottle filling station over here.

409
00:34:58,455 --> 00:34:59,796
[SPEAKER_16]: So that part hasn't changed.

410
00:35:01,737 --> 00:35:06,741
[SPEAKER_16]: So I can give you a little bit of context as to why we chose to make these adjustments.

411
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:20,403
[SPEAKER_16]: One of the things that we learned from Bitters is that in the original design, we had a number of posts for the shade sails that were going into the patio area, like where the pavement was.

412
00:35:20,923 --> 00:35:31,065
[SPEAKER_16]: And we also needed to relocate two existing light posts that were in that patio area to different spots so that they could fit the whole shade system.

413
00:35:32,385 --> 00:35:34,767
[SPEAKER_16]: And each of these posts also have footings.

414
00:35:35,128 --> 00:35:39,031
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's actually a significant amount of disruption to the paving here.

415
00:35:39,692 --> 00:35:52,504
[SPEAKER_16]: And so bidders were making very conservative estimates as to the amount of pavement that they'd have to replace, the risk of damage to the papers in that area.

416
00:35:52,664 --> 00:35:57,329
[SPEAKER_16]: So whatever we could do to minimize disruption to the actual patio.

417
00:35:57,977 --> 00:36:00,440
[SPEAKER_16]: it would help us recuperate some costs.

418
00:36:02,101 --> 00:36:17,457
[SPEAKER_16]: The tree over here, I'll add that while it also benefits us by allowing us to put a shade sail here, but we realize that there's this large piece of ledge just under the surface in this area.

419
00:36:19,002 --> 00:36:31,993
[SPEAKER_16]: For the long term health of the tree, it's probably not the best spot to locate it anyway, because it's sort of surrounded and bounded on all sides by pavement or by hard structure.

420
00:36:32,393 --> 00:36:37,558
[SPEAKER_16]: So we think that it may thrive better over here anyway, while also providing more optimal shade.

421
00:36:40,336 --> 00:36:47,800
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll add one last thing about the design, which is that it will be out to bid as of tomorrow morning.

422
00:36:49,301 --> 00:36:59,507
[SPEAKER_16]: So this is all in the base bid, and as a bid alternate, we wanted to have the opportunity to maybe pay for the larger deck footprint.

423
00:37:00,067 --> 00:37:11,636
[SPEAKER_16]: So it will just depend on what we see as far as bidding interest and budget, but that option is still maintained by the bid alternate.

424
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,502
[SPEAKER_16]: just a couple reference photos.

425
00:37:15,782 --> 00:37:16,823
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll collapse this.

426
00:37:16,843 --> 00:37:19,867
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if you guys see my little double screen here.

427
00:37:21,408 --> 00:37:33,461
[SPEAKER_16]: So this is the composite decking and little kick rail, which was a recommendation from our disability specialist, Nicholas Karenge in the city.

428
00:37:35,215 --> 00:37:47,323
[SPEAKER_16]: So just as an example of what this might look like, as well as the water bottle filling station, which we have iterations of this in Carr Park and McGlynn.

429
00:37:47,844 --> 00:37:49,365
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a product we're familiar with.

430
00:37:51,346 --> 00:37:52,147
[SPEAKER_16]: Oops, sorry.

431
00:37:53,327 --> 00:38:03,314
[SPEAKER_16]: And then an example of the metal surface mounted commercial umbrellas and the swoopy shade sail.

432
00:38:05,141 --> 00:38:08,823
[SPEAKER_16]: And there's a drawing here to give you a sense of scale.

433
00:38:09,324 --> 00:38:12,326
[SPEAKER_16]: So it arcs over the plaza, and there would be two of these.

434
00:38:15,468 --> 00:38:17,169
[SPEAKER_16]: And just a little refresher on funding.

435
00:38:17,449 --> 00:38:19,951
[SPEAKER_16]: So we received a park grant for just shy of $200,000.

436
00:38:20,051 --> 00:38:22,132
[SPEAKER_16]: We received CPA funding last year for $144,000.

437
00:38:22,172 --> 00:38:24,154
[SPEAKER_16]: And this ask here, oh, gosh, I'm sorry.

438
00:38:32,279 --> 00:38:37,180
[SPEAKER_16]: of $125,000 is, I will full disclosure, a little bit hand wavy.

439
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:47,842
[SPEAKER_16]: I wanted to preserve the opportunity to come before you guys to present this and request additional funding.

440
00:38:48,783 --> 00:38:58,025
[SPEAKER_16]: It is my hope that when we close the bids on November 5, maybe we will not need to apply for funding and we can rescind this application.

441
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:06,200
[SPEAKER_16]: But and so I will have that information to you all before your November 18th meeting.

442
00:39:07,641 --> 00:39:17,428
[SPEAKER_16]: But I suppose just in the interest of keeping the door open and the conversation going, I thought it important to come before you guys.

443
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:29,477
[SPEAKER_16]: And that is in part because this project does have a completion deadline because of the park grant.

444
00:39:30,019 --> 00:39:33,363
[SPEAKER_16]: It must be done by June 1 of next year.

445
00:39:33,383 --> 00:39:38,448
[SPEAKER_16]: I think this is actually a really good time of year for us to be bidding this project.

446
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:44,255
[SPEAKER_16]: It's right before the holidays start to kick in and as contractors are trying to schedule the next

447
00:39:44,915 --> 00:39:50,579
[SPEAKER_16]: um, season and the duration of the work shouldn't be very long, a month or two.

448
00:39:51,339 --> 00:39:58,424
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, so that, you know, if they start in the spring, uh, that should be sufficient time to finish by June.

449
00:39:59,245 --> 00:40:08,291
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, but, uh, some of that, or that is definitely dependent on whether we get, um, a successful bid this time around.

450
00:40:08,945 --> 00:40:21,729
[SPEAKER_16]: And so having the flexibility and ability to be nimble and just sort of keeping a couple of different irons in the fire to allow us to do that is part of why I'm before you guys today.

451
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:25,750
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'll pause there.

452
00:40:26,571 --> 00:40:29,792
[SPEAKER_10]: Just a couple of procedural points.

453
00:40:30,512 --> 00:40:33,433
[SPEAKER_10]: First, thank you for showing the timeline.

454
00:40:33,882 --> 00:40:57,458
[SPEAKER_10]: do you need to request expedited decision so that you're able to have a funding commitment in hand when you, I mean, we won't be able to have a decision by November 5th, but we could have a decision by the end of November.

455
00:40:57,798 --> 00:40:59,179
[SPEAKER_10]: Would that be,

456
00:41:01,645 --> 00:41:03,871
[SPEAKER_10]: do you need to have an expedited decision?

457
00:41:05,036 --> 00:41:06,396
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, thank you for asking that.

458
00:41:07,077 --> 00:41:15,259
[SPEAKER_16]: So an expedited decision, should we need or should we continue with our application before the CPC, would be very helpful.

459
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:29,184
[SPEAKER_16]: It's part of why I had asked Teresa if I could come before you guys in this October session, even though the bid hasn't opened and won't be closed yet, just so that you all can be familiar with the project and kind of mulling it over.

460
00:41:29,764 --> 00:41:32,245
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think that, you know,

461
00:41:33,285 --> 00:41:41,990
[SPEAKER_16]: If we need to, end of November into December would be viable.

462
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:54,896
[SPEAKER_16]: But I think certainly before the end of this year would be very helpful for securing that contract should we be proceeding with this application.

463
00:41:54,916 --> 00:41:58,278
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

464
00:42:00,605 --> 00:42:04,026
[SPEAKER_10]: The timing is awkward, but I think it might be manageable for us.

465
00:42:05,766 --> 00:42:07,487
[SPEAKER_10]: Jeremy, I'll recognize you in one moment.

466
00:42:07,507 --> 00:42:29,812
[SPEAKER_10]: The other comment that I wanted to make was that even if you don't need the funding, I think we need to keep this application in the stream to approve a change in scope, since this iteration of the project is significantly different from what you have presented.

467
00:42:31,088 --> 00:42:34,390
[SPEAKER_10]: when you originally awarded the funds last year?

468
00:42:36,391 --> 00:42:37,352
[SPEAKER_10]: Understood, yes.

469
00:42:39,513 --> 00:42:39,973
[SPEAKER_10]: Jeremy?

470
00:42:42,554 --> 00:42:44,956
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, and thanks for that great presentation, Amanda.

471
00:42:46,536 --> 00:42:56,962
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious to know, have any, in this kind of VE process, have any other alternatives been explored that didn't rely on a structured

472
00:42:59,385 --> 00:43:04,791
[SPEAKER_00]: integral shade element, or was there?

473
00:43:07,231 --> 00:43:08,212
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, yeah.

474
00:43:09,053 --> 00:43:21,283
[SPEAKER_16]: So I had to meet with the administrator for the park grant, which is the other funding that we received for this project, to understand what parameters they had for maintaining their funding.

475
00:43:21,743 --> 00:43:30,110
[SPEAKER_16]: And one of the parameters was that we shade the same amount of area that we had originally proposed in our first design.

476
00:43:30,551 --> 00:43:32,732
[SPEAKER_16]: And they did have a strong preference for having

477
00:43:34,325 --> 00:43:37,889
[SPEAKER_16]: shade sails as some element of the design.

478
00:43:40,058 --> 00:43:44,562
[SPEAKER_16]: just as a durable and, I guess, aesthetic option.

479
00:43:45,683 --> 00:43:59,956
[SPEAKER_16]: So we looked at and kind of vetted with them and included also Teresa as part of these conversations to understand what other types of shade we could do, whether it's more robust tree plantings.

480
00:44:01,397 --> 00:44:03,459
[SPEAKER_16]: We looked at different types of umbrellas.

481
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:18,622
[SPEAKER_16]: Landed on these options, um, for, for those, uh, to, uh, existing seating areas kind of after throwing around a couple of ideas and considering budget, um,

482
00:44:19,385 --> 00:44:38,671
[SPEAKER_16]: I may have mentioned this already, but another piece of avoiding disruption to the patio area, we were a little bit limited to trying to use the landscape areas for sighting posts and things like that.

483
00:44:41,171 --> 00:44:43,292
[SPEAKER_16]: So did that answer your question?

484
00:44:44,347 --> 00:44:44,927
[SPEAKER_00]: It does, yes.

485
00:44:45,067 --> 00:44:45,467
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

486
00:44:46,087 --> 00:45:04,411
[SPEAKER_00]: Just so I understand, I see in looking at street view, it looks like on the south side of the plaza, there are some existing integral benches or tables that are built into the pavement.

487
00:45:04,491 --> 00:45:08,552
[SPEAKER_00]: Are those replaced by the umbrella picnic tables?

488
00:45:09,212 --> 00:45:11,253
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have misunderstood that.

489
00:45:11,815 --> 00:45:13,436
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, no, that's a fair question.

490
00:45:13,556 --> 00:45:22,778
[SPEAKER_16]: So the picture that I showed you of those disc umbrellas was a little misleading, because it showed attached to it a table and chair set.

491
00:45:23,139 --> 00:45:34,922
[SPEAKER_16]: But actually, they can come separate from those table and chairs, which I think is our preference, because we have existing seating there, and we can anchor it to the ground in this case.

492
00:45:35,783 --> 00:45:35,923
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.

493
00:45:36,043 --> 00:45:37,023
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for clarifying.

494
00:45:43,592 --> 00:45:43,892
[SPEAKER_11]: Doug?

495
00:45:45,393 --> 00:45:46,754
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, this looks great.

496
00:45:46,854 --> 00:45:52,018
[SPEAKER_13]: Obviously, I voted for the last version, which would have been nice, but this is actually still pretty good.

497
00:45:52,058 --> 00:45:55,200
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think the sales are nice, dramatic flair.

498
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:59,203
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it will punch up that space, make it a little bit of a feature.

499
00:45:59,223 --> 00:46:00,444
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think it's a good decision.

500
00:46:00,504 --> 00:46:05,487
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a good balance between design and the functionality that you're looking for.

501
00:46:05,507 --> 00:46:06,428
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think that's all good.

502
00:46:08,649 --> 00:46:08,910
[SPEAKER_13]: I think

503
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:17,792
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a way with the contract and the sequence that Roberto was describing to, you know, no one's going to start building until March or April anyway, right?

504
00:46:17,812 --> 00:46:19,373
[SPEAKER_13]: You actually have plenty of time.

505
00:46:19,953 --> 00:46:21,413
[SPEAKER_13]: You need to line people up obviously.

506
00:46:21,433 --> 00:46:35,297
[SPEAKER_13]: But I was hoping there was a way with the folks in City Hall where you could, you know, if you need money from us, whatever, whether it's the full 125 or some fraction thereof, that we could still figure it out.

507
00:46:35,317 --> 00:46:37,338
[SPEAKER_13]: Because as you probably know, we have

508
00:46:38,498 --> 00:46:41,779
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know, we have a lot more requests than we do dollars.

509
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:48,462
[SPEAKER_13]: To me, this is a big priority because I think anyone who goes to Medford Square could benefit from this.

510
00:46:48,622 --> 00:46:53,604
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a lot of people who could benefit, so I see this as a really good priority.

511
00:46:54,724 --> 00:46:58,645
[SPEAKER_13]: But I'm hoping we can not rush it if we don't need to.

512
00:46:58,825 --> 00:47:05,428
[SPEAKER_13]: Just by the way, how we award, what the time award is, and knowing that they're not going to build for at least five months from now.

513
00:47:07,356 --> 00:47:08,577
[SPEAKER_16]: That's so valid, yes.

514
00:47:08,897 --> 00:47:17,844
[SPEAKER_16]: I think what I'll do after this is meet with our procurement staff just to understand how we could structure that and build in a bit more flexibility.

515
00:47:18,665 --> 00:47:30,774
[SPEAKER_16]: And you're right, that building certainly won't, unless, I don't know, it would be a rare thing, I think, for a contractor to get an award and build this fall for this project.

516
00:47:30,854 --> 00:47:33,416
[SPEAKER_16]: So yeah, I think that we can

517
00:47:36,485 --> 00:47:37,605
[SPEAKER_16]: we can make something work.

518
00:47:38,165 --> 00:47:41,246
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it's a procurement language thing more than anything else, I think.

519
00:47:43,186 --> 00:47:43,546
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

520
00:47:49,827 --> 00:47:51,007
[SPEAKER_10]: Thoughts, questions?

521
00:47:53,768 --> 00:48:05,430
[SPEAKER_10]: I had a thought that came to me, which was I heard words this evening like aesthetic and dramatic referring to the shade sales.

522
00:48:06,107 --> 00:48:32,938
[SPEAKER_10]: I wonder if we could lean into that by maybe working with the Arts Commission and inviting the arts community to personalize the sales and kind of be able to use that as an opportunity to bring in our public art element into Medford Square.

523
00:48:35,474 --> 00:48:36,294
[SPEAKER_16]: That's really fun.

524
00:48:36,374 --> 00:48:48,101
[SPEAKER_16]: So maybe customizing the sails that are the canvas sails or whatever material they are on the shade structures, having that be kind of a public conversation.

525
00:48:48,121 --> 00:48:51,162
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, just a thought.

526
00:48:51,723 --> 00:48:52,003
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

527
00:48:54,224 --> 00:48:56,305
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, that's a great idea.

528
00:48:57,766 --> 00:49:00,948
[SPEAKER_16]: Let me think a bit on that and talk with our designer.

529
00:49:02,447 --> 00:49:10,050
[SPEAKER_16]: But I feel like we could have a cool community conversation this fall and winter about what design and colors should be on there.

530
00:49:12,311 --> 00:49:20,915
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we're opining, I'll just say that I think that I'd love to see more trees planted here to create shade as a priority.

531
00:49:21,595 --> 00:49:26,097
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do think that these sales can be dramatic and certainly effective, but they have a lifespan.

532
00:49:26,478 --> 00:49:29,099
[SPEAKER_00]: And in 10 years, we'll be either

533
00:49:30,145 --> 00:49:34,928
[SPEAKER_00]: replacing them or wishing they weren't there potentially.

534
00:49:34,948 --> 00:49:36,909
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had it happen in other projects.

535
00:49:36,989 --> 00:49:40,491
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a tree will be there for a hundred years.

536
00:49:40,931 --> 00:49:52,998
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how, I know you've got a design and that's what we're focused on, but I think that there are other things that could be done.

537
00:49:54,124 --> 00:49:55,245
[SPEAKER_00]: more cost effectively.

538
00:49:56,786 --> 00:49:58,547
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.

539
00:49:58,587 --> 00:50:00,489
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a valid point, Jeremy.

540
00:50:00,649 --> 00:50:05,853
[SPEAKER_16]: And we've heard sort of different opinions about more trees in that area.

541
00:50:05,993 --> 00:50:13,138
[SPEAKER_16]: I think possibly an advantage of this design is that we're making use of existing tree canopy.

542
00:50:14,005 --> 00:50:29,083
[SPEAKER_16]: In the adjacent lawn area that is already used by folks and so creating accessible path there and then the southern area of the patio will be shaded primarily by trees, and they'll have the umbrellas there as well.

543
00:50:29,383 --> 00:50:31,886
[SPEAKER_16]: And that can be removed if they become, you know.

544
00:50:33,622 --> 00:50:45,011
[SPEAKER_16]: duplicative, and the shade sails are kind of an interim solution because those trees that are planted in the southern area will take time to mature.

545
00:50:45,311 --> 00:50:51,476
[SPEAKER_16]: That probably doesn't address all of your feedback, but yeah, I figured I'd offer.

546
00:50:51,856 --> 00:50:52,617
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I appreciate that.

547
00:50:52,677 --> 00:50:58,962
[SPEAKER_00]: And the deck under the trees is commendable and a feature that I like very much, a great way to use that space and protect those trees.

548
00:50:59,022 --> 00:50:59,922
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for that.

549
00:51:00,443 --> 00:51:03,165
[SPEAKER_00]: And keeping that as part of the project, I think, is really important.

550
00:51:04,615 --> 00:51:06,216
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that composite decking under the trees?

551
00:51:06,356 --> 00:51:07,416
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that what your image showed?

552
00:51:07,976 --> 00:51:08,236
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

553
00:51:08,976 --> 00:51:09,417
[SPEAKER_13]: OK, good.

554
00:51:09,657 --> 00:51:10,117
[SPEAKER_13]: It looks good.

555
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:12,778
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a good design.

556
00:51:13,238 --> 00:51:31,184
[SPEAKER_09]: I do wonder about future patio projects like this that the city undertakes, whether there's opportunities to just preserve trees that are already there or do plantings amidst the patio, kind of thinking about the McGlynn playground and how a lot of old trees are preserved in there.

557
00:51:31,844 --> 00:51:32,224
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyway.

558
00:51:33,286 --> 00:51:35,587
[SPEAKER_09]: could address some of these issues in a future project.

559
00:51:43,949 --> 00:51:44,490
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

560
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:45,990
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, everyone.

561
00:51:46,050 --> 00:51:52,092
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that covers the Riverside Plaza Shade Improvement Project.

562
00:51:52,112 --> 00:51:52,932
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Amanda.

563
00:51:53,573 --> 00:51:54,533
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks, Amanda.

564
00:51:54,693 --> 00:51:55,213
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks, Amanda.

565
00:51:59,883 --> 00:52:06,329
[SPEAKER_10]: Next up is the Blaystead Park digital scoreboard.

566
00:52:06,349 --> 00:52:19,340
[SPEAKER_10]: And while we transition, I just wanted to point out again, a few of you just came in the room, there's some snacks and water on top of the file cabinet that's for us.

567
00:52:22,328 --> 00:52:22,588
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

568
00:52:22,968 --> 00:52:23,408
[SPEAKER_07]: Coach.

569
00:52:23,749 --> 00:52:25,029
[SPEAKER_07]: Coach Oz, step on up.

570
00:52:25,289 --> 00:52:26,410
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

571
00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:27,650
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is a camera.

572
00:52:27,850 --> 00:52:28,211
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

573
00:52:28,571 --> 00:52:35,594
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, you can just talk and look like that's, I mean, the folks online only ever see this side of my face.

574
00:52:36,674 --> 00:52:40,716
[SPEAKER_07]: So feel free to see, Stan, however you're comfortable.

575
00:52:40,736 --> 00:52:41,416
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, absolutely.

576
00:52:41,436 --> 00:52:41,877
[SPEAKER_19]: I see that.

577
00:52:41,897 --> 00:52:47,499
[SPEAKER_19]: So, um, thank you again for inviting me and giving me the opportunity.

578
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:49,340
[SPEAKER_19]: My name's Orazio Azzarello.

579
00:52:49,937 --> 00:52:54,239
[SPEAKER_19]: I am the head baseball coach in Medford High School since 2021.

580
00:52:54,679 --> 00:53:03,222
[SPEAKER_19]: I've been in the program since 2012 as an assistant coach and also a graduate of Medford High School, showing my age in 1995.

581
00:53:03,342 --> 00:53:14,807
[SPEAKER_19]: So I grew up in Medford, and the reason for me to be here tonight is to have a digital school board at Placid Park, Bombo Catch Field.

582
00:53:16,618 --> 00:53:18,618
[SPEAKER_19]: great location for a baseball field.

583
00:53:18,658 --> 00:53:21,679
[SPEAKER_19]: That is our high school diamond that's shared by the city.

584
00:53:22,339 --> 00:53:26,840
[SPEAKER_19]: And we're looking to see if we can add some value to the field.

585
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:30,560
[SPEAKER_19]: If you've been down there, it's a beautiful area.

586
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:33,521
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's just, it's missing some parts.

587
00:53:33,561 --> 00:53:43,063
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think a sport board at the field would be something that the city would enjoy, the fans, the families, the parents, the community.

588
00:53:43,643 --> 00:53:44,683
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a lot of history.

589
00:53:45,298 --> 00:53:48,040
[SPEAKER_19]: in Medford, especially with Medford baseball.

590
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:53,743
[SPEAKER_19]: Next month, we are inducting the 1983 baseball team who went undefeated.

591
00:53:53,763 --> 00:53:58,466
[SPEAKER_19]: Last team that ever went undefeated in a regular season, they went 20-0.

592
00:53:58,486 --> 00:54:03,529
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's funny because those people still ask about the field and what's being done.

593
00:54:03,589 --> 00:54:07,931
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think this is a great opportunity for the community to come together.

594
00:54:07,951 --> 00:54:12,894
[SPEAKER_19]: Also, you will see revenue being generated here.

595
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:18,493
[SPEAKER_19]: because the field will now be rented probably a bit more once people see a scoreboard.

596
00:54:19,454 --> 00:54:22,156
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm part of a lot of amateur baseball leagues during the summer.

597
00:54:22,756 --> 00:54:37,005
[SPEAKER_19]: And with other cities and towns, you see that they rent out their field almost every single day or night because of lights or a scoreboard, which is, I think, great for the city because that money is now coming in and you're generating some revenue.

598
00:54:37,566 --> 00:54:40,668
[SPEAKER_19]: But we have spoken to a couple of vendors

599
00:54:41,738 --> 00:54:47,542
[SPEAKER_19]: We met with them down at the park to get some ideas on where we could put that scoreboard.

600
00:54:48,522 --> 00:54:52,985
[SPEAKER_19]: The ask is for $110,000 for the scoreboard.

601
00:54:53,745 --> 00:54:56,247
[SPEAKER_19]: That is one example right there that Teresa has put up.

602
00:54:57,067 --> 00:54:58,108
[SPEAKER_19]: We have several others.

603
00:54:59,088 --> 00:55:04,151
[SPEAKER_19]: We just want to make sure that the kids are getting something out of this.

604
00:55:04,451 --> 00:55:07,813
[SPEAKER_19]: They work their tails off to play down at that field.

605
00:55:07,833 --> 00:55:10,395
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think as a younger kid growing up,

606
00:55:10,743 --> 00:55:13,405
[SPEAKER_19]: you always want to be able to play on the high school field.

607
00:55:13,485 --> 00:55:17,609
[SPEAKER_19]: And the high school field was kind of the top of the line where you want to be playing.

608
00:55:17,729 --> 00:55:24,195
[SPEAKER_19]: And if you have a nice scoreboard or dugout or a new field, it's, it makes you want to play a little bit harder on that field.

609
00:55:24,915 --> 00:55:31,100
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, my past team, we just won the greater Boston league this past spring, first time in 10 years.

610
00:55:31,781 --> 00:55:35,044
[SPEAKER_19]: And, uh, the parents came to me and said, is there anything we can do?

611
00:55:35,064 --> 00:55:38,687
[SPEAKER_19]: I placed it, uh, just on one of that group and really kind of,

612
00:55:39,124 --> 00:55:40,805
[SPEAKER_19]: bring some history back to Medford.

613
00:55:41,986 --> 00:55:50,232
[SPEAKER_19]: I see a lot of scoreboards being placed at the Little League level, but at the Big Diamond, there is no scoreboard at any Big Diamond field in Medford.

614
00:55:50,793 --> 00:55:59,299
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's Hickey Park, Morrison Park, Barry Park, and Placid Park, where if you're a high school player, you're going to play there.

615
00:55:59,379 --> 00:56:05,524
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think when you get on the field, you want to be able to say, wow, that scoreboard belongs to us.

616
00:56:05,544 --> 00:56:06,524
[SPEAKER_19]: It's home of the Mustangs.

617
00:56:09,410 --> 00:56:11,371
[SPEAKER_19]: Also to honor Momopet Field.

618
00:56:11,391 --> 00:56:16,895
[SPEAKER_19]: Bill Momopet was a former Red Sox player who grew up in Medford, helped out to the community.

619
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:20,758
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think having his name on it would be grateful as well.

620
00:56:20,818 --> 00:56:23,039
[SPEAKER_19]: So that is our idea.

621
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:29,344
[SPEAKER_19]: I think if we can put something together, we would love to work with you.

622
00:56:30,064 --> 00:56:33,907
[SPEAKER_19]: And we've also even talked about raising money if we had to do that.

623
00:56:34,667 --> 00:56:38,390
[SPEAKER_19]: I think the community would come together to try to put this forward.

624
00:56:39,162 --> 00:56:39,863
[SPEAKER_19]: at the park.

625
00:56:39,963 --> 00:56:46,507
[SPEAKER_19]: It's been asked by a lot of people, and I think that if we come together as a community, we can get it done.

626
00:56:49,109 --> 00:56:49,830
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

627
00:56:50,290 --> 00:56:50,990
[SPEAKER_06]: Questions?

628
00:56:51,891 --> 00:56:53,792
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there lighting at that field right now?

629
00:56:53,832 --> 00:56:54,493
[SPEAKER_19]: There is not.

630
00:56:54,633 --> 00:56:54,873
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

631
00:56:55,433 --> 00:56:57,335
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that like a future project you have in mind?

632
00:56:58,355 --> 00:56:59,997
[SPEAKER_19]: If you want to say future, yeah, absolutely.

633
00:57:00,297 --> 00:57:01,918
[SPEAKER_19]: It would be a great idea to have that.

634
00:57:02,358 --> 00:57:04,460
[SPEAKER_19]: And again, I talked about the revenue piece of it.

635
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:07,702
[SPEAKER_19]: That would help with revenue because

636
00:57:08,764 --> 00:57:12,527
[SPEAKER_19]: being involved with baseball during the summer, the fields get rented out.

637
00:57:13,227 --> 00:57:19,672
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think if we sat down with the department that rents out fields, we could really help out there.

638
00:57:19,812 --> 00:57:22,374
[SPEAKER_19]: But that's something in the future if we decided that.

639
00:57:29,719 --> 00:57:37,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think this project is honorable, to be honest with you, and it's probably about

640
00:57:42,908 --> 00:57:44,689
[SPEAKER_02]: never had a playset park.

641
00:57:45,369 --> 00:57:56,071
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do remember playing at a playset when I was young, when we used to have round-robin tournaments at the various fields.

642
00:57:56,671 --> 00:57:58,272
[SPEAKER_02]: We went to Carr Park.

643
00:57:58,332 --> 00:57:59,612
[SPEAKER_02]: We went to Hickey Park.

644
00:58:00,192 --> 00:58:01,253
[SPEAKER_02]: We went to Barry Park.

645
00:58:01,273 --> 00:58:02,393
[SPEAKER_02]: We went to Morrison Park.

646
00:58:02,413 --> 00:58:03,413
[SPEAKER_02]: We went to Duggar Park.

647
00:58:03,773 --> 00:58:04,933
[SPEAKER_02]: We went to a playset park.

648
00:58:06,074 --> 00:58:06,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Never at night.

649
00:58:08,054 --> 00:58:08,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay?

650
00:58:08,634 --> 00:58:09,835
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't have lights.

651
00:58:10,055 --> 00:58:11,055
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have a scoreboard.

652
00:58:12,856 --> 00:58:21,582
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go to any high school in this immediate area, any GBL field, every GBL field has a scoreboard.

653
00:58:22,663 --> 00:58:39,955
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it's embarrassing to say the least that Medford does not have a scoreboard so that when you go to the game, if you come to the game at the end of the first inning, you have to ask, are we winning?

654
00:58:41,110 --> 00:58:41,750
[SPEAKER_02]: or are we loose?

655
00:58:42,511 --> 00:58:49,654
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I am definitely in favor of this proposal, but that's neither here nor there.

656
00:58:50,034 --> 00:58:54,737
[SPEAKER_02]: In regards to the lights, we'd love to have lights there.

657
00:58:54,757 --> 00:59:05,262
[SPEAKER_02]: So, as you can see up in the Edgeley field, you know, the soft field gimmick and money handler fits.

658
00:59:06,632 --> 00:59:15,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, it's a revenue generating process to put lights in and then start to collect from the various teams.

659
00:59:16,881 --> 00:59:26,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Recently, we had the stone that was put up for Fred Knox.

660
00:59:27,349 --> 00:59:35,096
[SPEAKER_02]: And at that time, we had a presentation of the stone.

661
00:59:36,085 --> 00:59:39,547
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was quite exciting.

662
00:59:39,607 --> 00:59:47,172
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was everybody that was in baseball for the past 35 years or so, maybe 40 years, maybe 50.

663
00:59:47,252 --> 00:59:48,393
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know.

664
00:59:48,433 --> 00:59:57,158
[SPEAKER_02]: But they were very disappointed that A, we didn't have a scoreboard, and B, we didn't have any facilities.

665
00:59:59,379 --> 01:00:05,243
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we can work on at least the scoreboard, it would probably be

666
01:00:07,871 --> 01:00:13,956
[SPEAKER_02]: It will relieve some of the anxiety that baseball teams have when they come and get off the bus.

667
01:00:16,798 --> 01:00:17,099
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

668
01:00:18,340 --> 01:00:23,944
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I'd like to add that we're probably the only high school team that does not have a scoreboard.

669
01:00:25,225 --> 01:00:26,687
[SPEAKER_19]: All the other sports have a scoreboard.

670
01:00:27,567 --> 01:00:31,170
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think that, again, it's revenue generated.

671
01:00:31,230 --> 01:00:36,335
[SPEAKER_19]: And also, the scoreboard that we're looking to try to get would also allow us to have sponsors on it.

672
01:00:37,025 --> 01:00:39,669
[SPEAKER_18]: sponsors can be able to donate money as well.

673
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:43,995
[SPEAKER_18]: But hopefully we can make this work.

674
01:00:44,997 --> 01:00:45,858
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks.

675
01:00:46,218 --> 01:00:47,160
[SPEAKER_10]: Question from Jeremy.

676
01:00:48,685 --> 01:00:50,286
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey coach, thanks for the presentation.

677
01:00:50,626 --> 01:00:57,528
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I see that we have several different quotes for different, I'm guessing variations of the scoreboard from you.

678
01:00:57,988 --> 01:01:02,590
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you just point me to the one that is reflected in the request here?

679
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:10,552
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause ones for like way more than the request and the other two are, are under what's included.

680
01:01:10,632 --> 01:01:10,952
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

681
01:01:11,813 --> 01:01:16,234
[SPEAKER_19]: There is several, uh, quotes and that's due to because of a solar,

682
01:01:17,345 --> 01:01:19,646
[SPEAKER_19]: The first option, it would be solar.

683
01:01:20,507 --> 01:01:26,329
[SPEAKER_19]: If that's not possible, then we would have to dig, and we would have to dig a trench.

684
01:01:26,969 --> 01:01:37,574
[SPEAKER_19]: So again, that would come down to, I know that the price is a little different, but we wanted to get some quotes out there to see, get a rough idea of what we wanted to do.

685
01:01:37,594 --> 01:01:44,777
[SPEAKER_19]: But that is the reason why there's different quotes in terms of the solar, and if we don't go solar, we would have to dig.

686
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:50,962
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there one of those quotes that you use to develop the $110,000 request?

687
01:01:52,663 --> 01:01:53,903
[SPEAKER_19]: There is.

688
01:01:54,263 --> 01:01:55,284
[SPEAKER_07]: So there is.

689
01:01:56,684 --> 01:01:58,065
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me share a screen right now.

690
01:01:58,705 --> 01:02:05,688
[SPEAKER_07]: So that $110,000 is really coming from the trenching that will likely be needed here.

691
01:02:07,519 --> 01:02:13,883
[SPEAKER_07]: I took that one on and I'm still trying to work with DPW to see what we might be able to do in-house versus going out to contract.

692
01:02:14,003 --> 01:02:18,586
[SPEAKER_07]: If it goes to contract, it's probably a $35,000 to $40,000 job.

693
01:02:19,586 --> 01:02:23,589
[SPEAKER_07]: We're looking at a scoreboard of 61,000.

694
01:02:24,470 --> 01:02:30,994
[SPEAKER_07]: Once we add that trenching in, add a contingency, that's where we landed at the 110,000 number.

695
01:02:31,014 --> 01:02:34,376
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm happy to elaborate on that if people have more questions.

696
01:02:34,843 --> 01:02:41,746
[SPEAKER_07]: This one's just that it's a little mushy because I can't, I haven't gotten a firm answer on whether or not DPW can assist.

697
01:02:42,106 --> 01:02:47,548
[SPEAKER_07]: So, and that's the difference between $0 and $30,000, unfortunately.

698
01:02:47,769 --> 01:02:48,649
[SPEAKER_00]: That's helpful, Teresa.

699
01:02:48,689 --> 01:02:49,069
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

700
01:02:49,109 --> 01:02:55,932
[SPEAKER_00]: So the file that says 1606 ETN, that's the one you've got up there now?

701
01:02:56,172 --> 01:02:56,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

702
01:02:57,173 --> 01:02:57,413
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

703
01:02:57,673 --> 01:02:57,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

704
01:02:58,073 --> 01:02:59,454
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's the one with the pitch count.

705
01:02:59,474 --> 01:03:02,655
[SPEAKER_07]: There's also one with the sponsorship.

706
01:03:04,366 --> 01:03:07,468
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, thank you.

707
01:03:10,930 --> 01:03:11,210
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

708
01:03:14,132 --> 01:03:15,733
[SPEAKER_07]: So there are a couple of different iterations.

709
01:03:15,753 --> 01:03:19,456
[SPEAKER_07]: There's one with the sponsorship, which would really be that revenue generator.

710
01:03:20,956 --> 01:03:23,498
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's really a matter of, can we trench?

711
01:03:24,439 --> 01:03:26,280
[SPEAKER_07]: If not, then can we do solar?

712
01:03:26,980 --> 01:03:31,303
[SPEAKER_07]: And solar was reflected in this, if I'm not mistaken.

713
01:03:40,387 --> 01:03:44,689
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like one of the other quotes has a solar component for about $5,800.

714
01:03:54,103 --> 01:04:02,410
[SPEAKER_05]: I was thinking if you could speak more on the sponsor information, is it possible for like a sponsor to finance any of this?

715
01:04:03,471 --> 01:04:08,935
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I don't know, like, sometimes you see like Coca Cola or something and we're having like a huge name.

716
01:04:09,015 --> 01:04:10,436
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, obviously, there's pros and cons to that.

717
01:04:10,476 --> 01:04:16,821
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just saying like, if you had a sponsor, be part of this, would that bring the price down?

718
01:04:16,981 --> 01:04:18,303
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no idea how sponsorship works.

719
01:04:18,503 --> 01:04:21,145
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you had any more information on that aspect.

720
01:04:22,573 --> 01:04:28,836
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I mean, my idea of sponsorship would be contracts where they would have it for, let's say, a five-year commitment.

721
01:04:29,716 --> 01:04:32,117
[SPEAKER_19]: And then we would be able to change that sponsorship.

722
01:04:32,137 --> 01:04:35,799
[SPEAKER_19]: Obviously, if someone goes out of business, you don't want to have that name there.

723
01:04:36,820 --> 01:04:38,080
[SPEAKER_19]: But that's how I would look at it.

724
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:42,762
[SPEAKER_19]: If we did it finance, that would be probably a negotiation between the city and the business.

725
01:04:43,143 --> 01:04:43,383
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

726
01:04:45,284 --> 01:04:45,984
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks, Doug.

727
01:04:48,130 --> 01:04:49,031
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, yeah, coach thing.

728
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:50,993
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a, this is a great project.

729
01:04:51,394 --> 01:04:53,376
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm looking forward to seeing this.

730
01:04:54,417 --> 01:05:00,824
[SPEAKER_13]: This project done this, this place does actually have a much deeper history than I think most people realize.

731
01:05:00,844 --> 01:05:05,268
[SPEAKER_13]: I think this was the 1st official park in the city's history because it went from.

732
01:05:06,249 --> 01:05:13,172
[SPEAKER_13]: Within 20 or 30 years from Brooks family farmland to what we see now, at least an initial version of it.

733
01:05:13,272 --> 01:05:22,715
[SPEAKER_13]: So it goes back, I think, literally to, I think, the 1st park in the city that I believe it was called Brooks playstate back in more than 100 years ago.

734
01:05:22,755 --> 01:05:23,036
[SPEAKER_13]: I think.

735
01:05:24,912 --> 01:05:28,914
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, it's the question I have, and again, I think I'm a huge, huge fan of this.

736
01:05:28,994 --> 01:05:29,954
[SPEAKER_13]: It helps a lot of kids.

737
01:05:30,074 --> 01:05:35,336
[SPEAKER_13]: My brother played for Neffert High back in the day as a baseball team.

738
01:05:37,377 --> 01:05:42,339
[SPEAKER_13]: Is the opposite, is the reason there are no lights is because the neighbors on Playstead Road don't want them?

739
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:51,782
[SPEAKER_19]: I've been hearing that for many years, and I think that is the reason, but I'm not sure if that's to confirm that.

740
01:05:52,462 --> 01:05:53,603
[SPEAKER_19]: I have knocked on those doors.

741
01:05:54,595 --> 01:06:00,419
[SPEAKER_19]: But I will say the lights now are totally different from 25, 30 years ago.

742
01:06:00,439 --> 01:06:07,323
[SPEAKER_19]: Obviously, you could control them from your phone, and the lights are just on the field, and they can turn off.

743
01:06:07,343 --> 01:06:08,844
[SPEAKER_19]: They're not on all night long.

744
01:06:09,824 --> 01:06:15,368
[SPEAKER_19]: And I really believe that men's missing the opportunity of bringing some revenue for that field.

745
01:06:15,388 --> 01:06:19,310
[SPEAKER_19]: That field gets used, but only by the high school and maybe some of the youth sports.

746
01:06:19,951 --> 01:06:23,693
[SPEAKER_19]: There are so many club teams and men's leagues out there that

747
01:06:24,464 --> 01:06:27,667
[SPEAKER_19]: Medford would be used, I'd say, six out of seven times during the week.

748
01:06:28,268 --> 01:06:29,109
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

749
01:06:29,249 --> 01:06:34,874
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's a different battle for a different day, but I definitely think it's worth revisiting with a new generation, frankly.

750
01:06:35,635 --> 01:06:35,955
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.

751
01:06:36,396 --> 01:06:39,118
[SPEAKER_13]: But I do support this, and I thank you for your presentation.

752
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:40,660
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you very much.

753
01:06:41,093 --> 01:06:41,413
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks.

754
01:06:41,613 --> 01:06:47,358
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually have a comment to Doug's last question and a few questions of myself.

755
01:06:49,199 --> 01:07:04,751
[SPEAKER_10]: The subject of lights at this field was actually an application that came to us in our very first funding round for CPA and was a subject that ended up shaping our application.

756
01:07:06,742 --> 01:07:22,009
[SPEAKER_10]: process because the request came from a citizen group, an athletic group, directly to the CPC without going through the city channels first.

757
01:07:22,209 --> 01:07:30,533
[SPEAKER_10]: And so the city was not aware that there was an application for lighting at the field until it came to us.

758
01:07:30,553 --> 01:07:31,073
[SPEAKER_10]: And so

759
01:07:36,435 --> 01:07:53,203
[SPEAKER_10]: After some controversy, we created an application process that ensured that requests like that would go through the city rather than directly to us first, because we aren't the arbiters of whether there should be lighting at a place like Deadfield.

760
01:07:53,223 --> 01:07:57,145
[SPEAKER_10]: That's really a decision that I think should be a consensus before it comes to the CPC.

761
01:07:59,887 --> 01:08:05,750
[SPEAKER_10]: on the subject of lighting at the field and just general future improvements.

762
01:08:05,830 --> 01:08:14,614
[SPEAKER_10]: I imagine that even if it's not in the next five years, down the road, we might be thinking about larger improvements to the field.

763
01:08:15,115 --> 01:08:18,216
[SPEAKER_10]: What is the condition of this field right now?

764
01:08:18,316 --> 01:08:20,417
[SPEAKER_10]: Is this field always playable?

765
01:08:20,637 --> 01:08:23,279
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it in rough condition?

766
01:08:23,379 --> 01:08:27,121
[SPEAKER_19]: I will say that DPW does the best they can with what they have.

767
01:08:27,181 --> 01:08:27,761
[SPEAKER_19]: Last year,

768
01:08:28,461 --> 01:08:30,982
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, we did fix the mound area.

769
01:08:31,403 --> 01:08:36,365
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, we did not play at the field for the first month because the weather, um, and they were fixing the field.

770
01:08:37,046 --> 01:08:40,847
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, I would have to say, yeah, we definitely need a new field.

771
01:08:41,168 --> 01:08:42,188
[SPEAKER_19]: I would, I would say that.

772
01:08:42,208 --> 01:08:45,050
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, and I think some people would agree with me with that.

773
01:08:45,470 --> 01:08:56,655
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, if you've been down there and walk the field, the fence is not in great shape and someone could get hurt if someone actually runs into the fence and gets pulled by, you know, a bar or something.

774
01:08:56,695 --> 01:08:57,736
[SPEAKER_19]: But, um,

775
01:08:58,226 --> 01:09:00,387
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, that's another thing that we can talk about.

776
01:09:00,868 --> 01:09:07,152
[SPEAKER_19]: But I want to make sure that we can get approved for the scoreboard and we can work through that.

777
01:09:07,172 --> 01:09:17,979
[SPEAKER_10]: So I know there's an open space and recreation plan that's going to be coming up soon and that things like this might be in the open space and recreation plan to make overall improvements.

778
01:09:18,239 --> 01:09:21,441
[SPEAKER_10]: But where this comes back to your specific request right now is

779
01:09:25,153 --> 01:09:34,614
[SPEAKER_10]: Lighting trench solar option would the eventual future desire to put.

780
01:09:36,684 --> 01:09:49,827
[SPEAKER_10]: to dig a trench to put lighting or to use a solar-powered scoreboard, are those interrelated considerations?

781
01:09:50,027 --> 01:09:55,088
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we want to make an investment now that we want to go in a different direction in the future?

782
01:09:55,108 --> 01:09:57,008
[SPEAKER_10]: Are they compatible?

783
01:09:57,728 --> 01:09:58,609
[SPEAKER_19]: That's a great question.

784
01:09:58,949 --> 01:10:03,650
[SPEAKER_19]: That's something that we would have to come together and say, what direction do we want to go?

785
01:10:03,930 --> 01:10:04,990
[SPEAKER_19]: The good news is if

786
01:10:05,577 --> 01:10:10,020
[SPEAKER_19]: somehow we did get a new field here in the future with lights, the swath can always be moved.

787
01:10:11,141 --> 01:10:14,263
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you like put in a trench, can the trench be moved?

788
01:10:15,184 --> 01:10:22,649
[SPEAKER_10]: Or do you, is the solar a waste if you're going to bring power to the site anyway?

789
01:10:22,830 --> 01:10:31,116
[SPEAKER_17]: Those are good questions that we can definitely take back and ask to the vendor to see what they can do if that happens in the future.

790
01:10:31,836 --> 01:10:34,058
[SPEAKER_18]: But yeah, I mean,

791
01:10:34,895 --> 01:10:38,556
[SPEAKER_18]: Ideally, yeah, it would be great to get a new field with lights and a scoreboard all at once.

792
01:10:39,036 --> 01:10:40,296
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't think that's likely.

793
01:10:40,316 --> 01:10:44,078
[SPEAKER_18]: That's why we're starting with a scoreboard and see where we go from there.

794
01:10:44,118 --> 01:10:47,218
[SPEAKER_18]: But we can definitely work together with that.

795
01:10:47,698 --> 01:11:02,462
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I always love to be able to, like, there are all of these different elements of the whole Placeton Park area that we've been asked to address piecemeal, basketball courts, tennis courts, now the baseball scoreboard.

796
01:11:02,983 --> 01:11:04,243
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, like,

797
01:11:07,632 --> 01:11:24,085
[SPEAKER_10]: It's sort of doing a park renovation in phases, which is really efficient, but I'd like to be able to think about the big picture and know where we're going so that each phase is contributing to the whole.

798
01:11:24,105 --> 01:11:30,049
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that's a great idea because I also think about a press box and facilities that Reggie said.

799
01:11:31,330 --> 01:11:33,232
[SPEAKER_19]: If we host a tournament game there,

800
01:11:33,901 --> 01:11:37,244
[SPEAKER_19]: and another team is coming to our field, there's no bathrooms.

801
01:11:38,305 --> 01:11:42,268
[SPEAKER_19]: So we say, we've got to find a place somewhere.

802
01:11:42,288 --> 01:11:43,169
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know where to go.

803
01:11:43,249 --> 01:11:46,011
[SPEAKER_19]: But you don't want to do that.

804
01:11:46,251 --> 01:11:48,634
[SPEAKER_19]: We have a facility, we have a press box, we have a scoreboard.

805
01:11:49,394 --> 01:11:51,576
[SPEAKER_19]: Right now, I think we're just behind in times with that.

806
01:11:51,596 --> 01:11:52,737
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's why we're starting here.

807
01:11:52,777 --> 01:11:54,078
[SPEAKER_19]: But I like your thinking.

808
01:11:56,120 --> 01:12:02,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to a point, one of the things that has occurred on my watch in the park commission is that we've done

809
01:12:02,605 --> 01:12:04,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Playstead Park, we've done several other parks.

810
01:12:05,347 --> 01:12:08,769
[SPEAKER_02]: There is electricity at Playstead now.

811
01:12:09,449 --> 01:12:12,751
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm a little curious about this trench thing.

812
01:12:12,771 --> 01:12:23,238
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I guess the trench would go from the existing lights, which are now at the basketball court, there's three or four lights at the basketball court.

813
01:12:24,038 --> 01:12:27,760
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's already an existing trench that goes to that point.

814
01:12:29,493 --> 01:12:46,043
[SPEAKER_02]: I would imagine that they would probably put the scoreboard on the track side of left field so that everybody can see it because nobody sits on that side of the field to be honest with you.

815
01:12:47,044 --> 01:12:54,548
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would imagine that it would be a small trench that would be necessary to be dug if we went with electric.

816
01:12:55,090 --> 01:12:58,132
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we went with solo, it doesn't matter.

817
01:12:58,412 --> 01:12:58,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

818
01:12:59,712 --> 01:13:15,660
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, when you're looking at when you're talking about piecemeal, well, yeah, you're piecemealing it, but it's a necessary evil to have a scoreboard so that you can know what's going on, on the field.

819
01:13:16,059 --> 01:13:19,782
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I mean, my calculation is not so much.

820
01:13:19,842 --> 01:13:21,763
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we need a scoreboard or not?

821
01:13:21,903 --> 01:13:35,273
[SPEAKER_10]: But really, like, how do we make sure that this investment lines up the next investment that we're going to be asked to make so that everything is going to, in the end, work together?

822
01:13:35,293 --> 01:13:40,157
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you mentioned the condition of the field.

823
01:13:41,374 --> 01:13:48,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Last year there was an investment made for the infield and the mound area and so on and so forth.

824
01:13:48,675 --> 01:13:55,337
[SPEAKER_02]: They put in new grass within the diamond and so on and so forth.

825
01:13:55,837 --> 01:14:08,819
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a company in Rhode Island that would actually have done a much better job on that particular field because it has a leveling component to its

826
01:14:10,464 --> 01:14:15,126
[SPEAKER_02]: procedures and would have eliminated a lot of the holes that are in the outfield.

827
01:14:15,766 --> 01:14:18,127
[SPEAKER_02]: We've talked about this in the past.

828
01:14:18,247 --> 01:14:28,350
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand what you're saying about piecemeal, but when your resources are limited, you do what you can when you can.

829
01:14:28,510 --> 01:14:29,010
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

830
01:14:29,030 --> 01:14:31,191
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw a question from Anna.

831
01:14:31,211 --> 01:14:33,592
[SPEAKER_09]: I know we're out of time, but

832
01:14:34,629 --> 01:14:42,992
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just looking at this neighborhood and I'm imagining how just knowing how this part of town feels about change.

833
01:14:43,512 --> 01:14:56,137
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm just imagining how these neighbors would feel about like facilities, lights, renting the fields out every night, more people coming for out of town games because there's all these facilities and whatever.

834
01:14:56,157 --> 01:15:00,959
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm like having a hard time picturing that flying in that specific community.

835
01:15:00,979 --> 01:15:02,880
[SPEAKER_09]: And it just makes me wonder, like,

836
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:15,550
[SPEAKER_09]: Is Pleistead the future, like obviously it's the past of where Medford baseball has always been, but is that also the future or is there a consideration of moving it somewhere that's like not in a neighborhood and especially a neighborhood that hates change?

837
01:15:16,671 --> 01:15:18,433
[SPEAKER_19]: I have heard that.

838
01:15:18,473 --> 01:15:20,214
[SPEAKER_09]: We are not alterable in West Medford.

839
01:15:20,475 --> 01:15:22,396
[SPEAKER_09]: Just to put that out there, okay?

840
01:15:22,456 --> 01:15:23,898
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, sorry, sorry.

841
01:15:23,938 --> 01:15:29,262
[SPEAKER_09]: Not that the whole neighborhood hates change, but many individuals in that neighborhood dislike change greatly.

842
01:15:30,758 --> 01:15:33,479
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, again, that would come down to what the city decides.

843
01:15:33,499 --> 01:15:35,940
[SPEAKER_19]: I know that they talked about maybe a new Medford High School.

844
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:38,180
[SPEAKER_19]: Those are those are great questions.

845
01:15:39,220 --> 01:15:48,903
[SPEAKER_09]: And like, if that were the case, is a scoreboard something is where I was thinking like projecting the future is a scoreboard of physical structure that could potentially be moved to a new Medford.

846
01:15:49,343 --> 01:15:49,523
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

847
01:15:49,603 --> 01:15:50,744
[SPEAKER_09]: A new location.

848
01:15:50,824 --> 01:15:51,084
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

849
01:15:51,364 --> 01:15:51,624
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

850
01:15:51,644 --> 01:15:52,644
[SPEAKER_09]: That was the only thing.

851
01:15:52,664 --> 01:15:53,044
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

852
01:15:53,064 --> 01:15:58,026
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm like, I'm having a really hard time picturing this becoming like a destination.

853
01:15:58,852 --> 01:15:59,752
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you know what I mean?

854
01:15:59,832 --> 01:16:03,473
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a great area because there's so much land there, but you're right, it's a neighborhood.

855
01:16:03,493 --> 01:16:06,793
[SPEAKER_19]: But I think wherever you go, I think you're going to run into a neighborhood.

856
01:16:06,833 --> 01:16:08,154
[SPEAKER_19]: But again, that's future.

857
01:16:09,614 --> 01:16:11,574
[SPEAKER_19]: We're starting with something with a school board.

858
01:16:11,594 --> 01:16:12,254
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll see how we get it.

859
01:16:12,274 --> 01:16:17,935
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and that's why we have the open space and recreation plan to answer those big community questions.

860
01:16:18,075 --> 01:16:18,356
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

861
01:16:18,856 --> 01:16:22,116
[SPEAKER_10]: I just had one last thing I know, Teresa, we need to move on.

862
01:16:22,236 --> 01:16:26,217
[SPEAKER_10]: One last thing is you had mentioned earlier fundraising.

863
01:16:27,216 --> 01:16:31,980
[SPEAKER_10]: And I wonder how, like, tell me more about fundraising.

864
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:39,045
[SPEAKER_10]: What could we do to like maybe make CPA funding a match to what the community is willing to give for?

865
01:16:39,065 --> 01:16:51,295
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I mean, it was thought between the parents and some business owners where if we did some kind of GoFundMe page, let's see what the community would raise.

866
01:16:51,355 --> 01:16:54,858
[SPEAKER_19]: And then maybe the difference or you guys match what we raise.

867
01:16:54,938 --> 01:16:55,318
[SPEAKER_19]: I just,

868
01:16:56,217 --> 01:17:00,819
[SPEAKER_19]: I think the community would help out in that situation if we had to go that route.

869
01:17:01,620 --> 01:17:02,960
[SPEAKER_18]: It was an idea.

870
01:17:03,501 --> 01:17:04,581
[SPEAKER_18]: We haven't put anything together.

871
01:17:04,601 --> 01:17:10,364
[SPEAKER_18]: We wanted to do this first and see where we stood, but it is an idea that we could try to do that.

872
01:17:10,544 --> 01:17:18,028
[SPEAKER_10]: So, just like you were here, we had a previous conversation about private funding.

873
01:17:18,548 --> 01:17:42,001
[SPEAKER_10]: if it would be possible for you to maybe set a goal for private funding and let Teresa know before we have our deliberations in December, you know, we might be able to consider a budget reflecting what you think you can gain from private funding, because that would be really helpful.

874
01:17:42,041 --> 01:17:45,543
[SPEAKER_10]: That would make funding available for some of these other really important projects.

875
01:17:46,457 --> 01:17:49,900
[SPEAKER_10]: that we're seeing on a very, very tight budget this year.

876
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:51,281
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, absolutely.

877
01:17:51,621 --> 01:17:51,921
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

878
01:17:52,421 --> 01:17:52,742
Thank you.

879
01:17:53,082 --> 01:17:55,203
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have a couple months to game plan?

880
01:17:55,564 --> 01:17:58,626
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, absolutely.

881
01:17:58,666 --> 01:18:08,012
[SPEAKER_19]: The plan to have this completed, if it does pass, was to try to have it done before the season, which is the spring in 2020, which is March or April.

882
01:18:09,393 --> 01:18:13,056
[SPEAKER_18]: Speaking to the vendors, they can do it even if the weather's terrible.

883
01:18:15,259 --> 01:18:19,962
[SPEAKER_19]: If we didn't get an agreement and approved, they can work on it right away, so.

884
01:18:20,283 --> 01:18:22,824
[SPEAKER_10]: Our timeline, we should be able to make a decision in the winter.

885
01:18:23,205 --> 01:18:23,565
[SPEAKER_10]: Perfect.

886
01:18:23,925 --> 01:18:24,185
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

887
01:18:25,426 --> 01:18:25,646
Yeah.

888
01:18:26,367 --> 01:18:27,128
[SPEAKER_17]: Any other questions?

889
01:18:29,309 --> 01:18:29,749
[SPEAKER_17]: We're good.

890
01:18:30,190 --> 01:18:30,830
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

891
01:18:31,110 --> 01:18:34,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much for your time.

892
01:18:34,173 --> 01:18:35,914
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks.

893
01:18:36,114 --> 01:18:37,595
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'll give you a call.

894
01:18:37,635 --> 01:18:38,696
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm calling everybody tomorrow.

895
01:18:38,836 --> 01:18:39,576
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, absolutely.

896
01:18:45,496 --> 01:18:49,640
[SPEAKER_06]: And the next coach, just so you're aware, Valerie did hop on.

897
01:18:50,701 --> 01:18:51,882
[SPEAKER_07]: So hi, Valerie.

898
01:18:54,564 --> 01:18:56,266
[SPEAKER_07]: Just wanted to let you know that.

899
01:18:56,346 --> 01:18:58,107
[SPEAKER_07]: I told her I was dying earlier.

900
01:18:58,127 --> 01:18:58,367
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect.

901
01:18:58,467 --> 01:19:00,149
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

902
01:19:00,189 --> 01:19:05,013
[SPEAKER_06]: So up next, we have the Slenderman and White from Foxhole.

903
01:19:05,033 --> 01:19:07,175
[SPEAKER_06]: We're only going to have her come on up here.

904
01:19:08,862 --> 01:19:09,902
[SPEAKER_06]: This report is online as well.

905
01:19:09,962 --> 01:19:11,063
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

906
01:19:11,083 --> 01:19:12,264
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

907
01:19:12,324 --> 01:19:14,164
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't need to say it if you don't want to.

908
01:19:14,264 --> 01:19:16,345
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems to be the popular thing to do.

909
01:19:16,365 --> 01:19:17,066
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the report.

910
01:19:17,226 --> 01:19:17,826
[SPEAKER_07]: I had no idea.

911
01:19:17,866 --> 01:19:19,027
[SPEAKER_07]: I just walked in at the same time.

912
01:19:19,087 --> 01:19:19,327
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yes.

913
01:19:19,367 --> 01:19:20,367
[SPEAKER_07]: I was very hurt by that.

914
01:19:20,427 --> 01:19:20,727
[SPEAKER_07]: All righty.

915
01:19:37,221 --> 01:19:38,041
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

916
01:19:38,301 --> 01:19:39,602
[SPEAKER_10]: You're welcome.

917
01:19:39,682 --> 01:19:44,823
[SPEAKER_10]: Introduce yourselves, just a few minutes, tell us about your project, and then I'll ask you questions.

918
01:19:45,263 --> 01:19:45,603
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

919
01:19:45,703 --> 01:19:49,584
[SPEAKER_15]: So first of all, thank you very much for having us here and for considering our application.

920
01:19:50,624 --> 01:19:51,605
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm Kevin Simon.

921
01:19:51,985 --> 01:19:53,205
[SPEAKER_15]: This is my wife, Hilary White.

922
01:19:53,325 --> 01:19:57,706
[SPEAKER_15]: We moved to Medford a little under two years ago, settling here.

923
01:19:58,146 --> 01:20:04,628
[SPEAKER_15]: The house we bought is a fairly historic house in the Warren Simmons Historic District in West Medford, where our

924
01:20:06,411 --> 01:20:15,273
[SPEAKER_15]: Calculus is probably the second oldest house in the immediate neighborhood that was built by the person who first lived there and the historic nature of the house.

925
01:20:19,894 --> 01:20:24,455
[SPEAKER_15]: The community of West Medford brought us out here, and that's something that we're really excited about.

926
01:20:24,475 --> 01:20:27,055
[SPEAKER_15]: We've been working on restoring the house ourselves.

927
01:20:27,075 --> 01:20:28,176
[SPEAKER_15]: We've got one-year-old now,

928
01:20:35,732 --> 01:20:39,053
[SPEAKER_15]: And so it's been a handful doing that restoration, much of the work ourselves.

929
01:20:39,774 --> 01:20:43,175
[SPEAKER_15]: But in addition to that, we have a really cool structure, the carriage house.

930
01:20:43,755 --> 01:20:52,579
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been told that it's one of the sort of like there's maybe about a dozen similar structures that are connected to lots like this.

931
01:20:52,759 --> 01:21:01,603
[SPEAKER_15]: And so we have been really interested, since we were drawn to the historic structure of the house and the property, we would really love to find a way to preserve this.

932
01:21:01,763 --> 01:21:04,024
[SPEAKER_15]: And so through and restoring.

933
01:21:04,799 --> 01:21:11,441
[SPEAKER_15]: And so through that process, we've also been seeing the conversation around affordability in Medford.

934
01:21:11,901 --> 01:21:14,381
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a really big topic, making more affordable housing.

935
01:21:14,401 --> 01:21:25,704
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm probably not going out too far on a limb to say that West Medford in particular has been a unique neighborhood in this conversation around change and adding density.

936
01:21:26,324 --> 01:21:28,885
[SPEAKER_15]: And so we see here as a structure that

937
01:21:29,466 --> 01:21:36,830
[SPEAKER_15]: adds invisible density with off-street parking in a way that also restores some of Bedford's historical structures.

938
01:21:36,850 --> 01:21:40,572
[SPEAKER_15]: So, Hilary, can I tell you about the plan?

939
01:21:40,632 --> 01:21:45,074
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so the project is going to take place over two phases.

940
01:21:45,494 --> 01:21:47,535
[SPEAKER_08]: The first is around stabilizing the structure.

941
01:21:48,176 --> 01:21:52,538
[SPEAKER_08]: The pictures on the previous slide, those are the current condition of the building.

942
01:21:54,119 --> 01:21:56,720
[SPEAKER_08]: Candidly, the last owners didn't take good

943
01:21:57,243 --> 01:21:57,743
[SPEAKER_04]: care of it.

944
01:21:58,564 --> 01:22:07,770
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a structure that was actually, they wanted to tear down, but because the home is in the Martin Simmons historic district, it was able to save the structure, which is pretty amazing story.

945
01:22:07,810 --> 01:22:11,292
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think really speaks to sort of the relevance of this as an asset.

946
01:22:12,733 --> 01:22:18,037
[SPEAKER_08]: So there does need to be work around stabilizing the structure first to make sure that we really preserve it for future generations.

947
01:22:18,817 --> 01:22:22,860
[SPEAKER_08]: But we think there's this opportunity to expand it into the one bedroom unit on that second floor.

948
01:22:24,233 --> 01:22:28,475
[SPEAKER_08]: One thing that's really unique about this building is the footprint is quite large already.

949
01:22:28,596 --> 01:22:29,876
[SPEAKER_08]: It's 600 square foot.

950
01:22:30,416 --> 01:22:47,425
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that means we can have a 600 square foot apartment on this second level, which would include a full kitchen, a separated dedicated bedroom, a bathroom with the, there's gonna be a plan for a washer and dryer in there, as well as a private roof deck, so private outdoor space.

951
01:22:47,905 --> 01:22:50,247
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll maintain the two-car garage on the bottom.

952
01:22:50,267 --> 01:22:52,668
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you go to the next slide,

953
01:22:54,031 --> 01:22:57,432
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a markup of what the outside of the structure will look like.

954
01:22:57,452 --> 01:23:05,896
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully it'll look quite familiar because we're really intending to really keep this historical integrity of the structure as much as we can.

955
01:23:05,916 --> 01:23:12,759
[SPEAKER_08]: The only real sort of changes to the exterior that we'd be making would be for the livability of that one bedroom unit.

956
01:23:12,779 --> 01:23:15,800
[SPEAKER_08]: So adding out the dormer and then some windows on that second floor.

957
01:23:15,820 --> 01:23:19,142
[SPEAKER_08]: Then on the last slide,

958
01:23:20,302 --> 01:23:27,947
[SPEAKER_08]: Just to really be transparent on how we see this project fitting in and supporting the CPC's objectives is really around two areas.

959
01:23:28,007 --> 01:23:40,654
[SPEAKER_08]: The first is around this additional affordable housing and the second around the restoration of a historical structure that's really sort of becoming, you know, an extinct, excuse me, breed in the city of Medford and Boston area.

960
01:23:41,314 --> 01:23:43,396
[SPEAKER_08]: But on the additional affordable housing front,

961
01:23:45,667 --> 01:23:58,314
[SPEAKER_08]: We just talked about West Medford being a really unique area, but thinking creatively about how can we bring in additional housing in a way that doesn't really change the deal of the neighborhood.

962
01:23:58,334 --> 01:24:10,801
[SPEAKER_08]: We're using the existing footprint of an existing structure to be able to bring in a new housing unit that we think that there's potential to support either a low or medium income household.

963
01:24:12,535 --> 01:24:30,088
[SPEAKER_08]: And then on the historic preservation front, you know, a lot of things I've touched on, this building has been neglected, but really seen it as a rare asset that's worth preserving, something that, you know, the city has intervened on before, and so continuing to make sure that it's available for future generations.

964
01:24:31,088 --> 01:24:39,995
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think the last thing that we wanted to share is, you know, we recognize this is a little bit of a different application, is my understanding that you guys typically see,

965
01:24:41,103 --> 01:24:42,984
[SPEAKER_08]: So we appreciate you guys considering it.

966
01:24:43,084 --> 01:24:49,269
[SPEAKER_08]: We think that there's kind of this existential question facing the Boston area around affordable housing.

967
01:24:49,309 --> 01:24:52,131
[SPEAKER_08]: How do you build more in places that people really want to live?

968
01:24:52,151 --> 01:24:53,111
[SPEAKER_08]: How do you make it affordable?

969
01:24:53,131 --> 01:24:58,595
[SPEAKER_08]: And we think we have an opportunity here to really thread that needle while also preserving a historic structure.

970
01:24:59,936 --> 01:25:04,979
[SPEAKER_08]: So really happy to have that conversation with you to figure out, can we make this work?

971
01:25:06,100 --> 01:25:06,540
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

972
01:25:08,702 --> 01:25:09,382
[SPEAKER_14]: Please.

973
01:25:10,490 --> 01:25:11,891
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for coming and presenting this.

974
01:25:12,091 --> 01:25:21,936
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm curious what led to the decision to preserve the two-car garage versus create a space that could support more than just one bedroom.

975
01:25:21,956 --> 01:25:29,840
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if that's part of the actual building's structural limitations or... I think it's a mixture.

976
01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:34,983
[SPEAKER_15]: We like the idea of having extra space of the two-car garage.

977
01:25:35,003 --> 01:25:37,644
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't plan on necessarily using it as a two-car garage.

978
01:25:38,303 --> 01:25:41,706
[SPEAKER_15]: workshop, so there's personal reasons why we wanted to keep it as is.

979
01:25:42,187 --> 01:25:47,972
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, the cost of one unit, the proposition of restoring the structure and adding one unit was pretty expensive.

980
01:25:48,933 --> 01:25:59,142
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think we don't have the pockets to create two structures, and we also have a structure with two units, and so that's kind of the reasoning there.

981
01:26:00,123 --> 01:26:03,606
[SPEAKER_15]: I think also it would substantially change

982
01:26:08,310 --> 01:26:11,492
[SPEAKER_15]: have garage doors or carriage doors or anything like that on it?

983
01:26:13,254 --> 01:26:13,814
[SPEAKER_15]: Good question, though.

984
01:26:20,219 --> 01:26:21,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Other questions?

985
01:26:21,380 --> 01:26:21,901
[SPEAKER_06]: Haley?

986
01:26:25,263 --> 01:26:27,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Roberta, did this qualify?

987
01:26:28,145 --> 01:26:32,529
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, just talking offhand, is this actually something that we could hypothetically approve?

988
01:26:33,477 --> 01:26:35,580
[SPEAKER_10]: I see that it qualifies in two areas.

989
01:26:36,060 --> 01:26:49,155
[SPEAKER_10]: It qualifies in preserving the exterior, making exterior restoration of this carriage house that's visible from the street.

990
01:26:51,258 --> 01:26:53,140
[SPEAKER_10]: For historic preservation alone,

991
01:26:54,089 --> 01:27:01,214
[SPEAKER_10]: we would have a question of whether it would be a priority to preserve a privately owned residence.

992
01:27:01,834 --> 01:27:17,564
[SPEAKER_10]: That is something that has come up in the past and the committee has either deemed it not to be a priority or we have put requirements or conditions on a project that homeowners felt were not worth the grant.

993
01:27:18,124 --> 01:27:21,927
[SPEAKER_10]: But the other part of this project of creating an affordable unit

994
01:27:24,287 --> 01:27:31,075
[SPEAKER_10]: That is very much one of our objectives is to create new affordable units.

995
01:27:31,415 --> 01:27:40,666
[SPEAKER_10]: So, as an affordable housing project, anything that creates this housing unit and makes it permanently affordable.

996
01:27:41,633 --> 01:28:04,424
[SPEAKER_10]: Would be eligible, but that permanent affordability is something that there is a, there's a guideline that we would have to follow to establish that permanent affordability with a long term deed restriction and and we could probably use city resources to help carry out the responsibilities of the of the deed restriction.

997
01:28:05,789 --> 01:28:12,433
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, so I mean, this is like a very going to be it would be extremely involved process for the homeowner.

998
01:28:12,573 --> 01:28:16,095
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it kind of opens the doors to like, who would be doing the leasing?

999
01:28:16,135 --> 01:28:21,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, who would be, you know, receiving the rental income, I would assume, right?

1000
01:28:21,438 --> 01:28:25,920
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, is this going to be deed restricted for affordability, like in perpetuity?

1001
01:28:28,723 --> 01:28:32,406
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, yeah, I think there's just the question of, they're just looking at the application.

1002
01:28:32,466 --> 01:28:36,990
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're requesting from us $461,000 and that they're saying that that's 50%.

1003
01:28:37,810 --> 01:28:41,113
[SPEAKER_05]: So that means the total cost of this project is pushing a million dollars.

1004
01:28:42,474 --> 01:28:45,036
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, whatever you guys, correct me if I'm wrong.

1005
01:28:45,056 --> 01:28:47,278
[SPEAKER_05]: So obviously, whatever you guys want to do with your money, that's awesome.

1006
01:28:47,298 --> 01:28:52,782
[SPEAKER_05]: But I feel like that's a really large ask of the CPC to make one bedroom

1007
01:28:54,538 --> 01:28:55,859
[SPEAKER_05]: ADU affordable unit.

1008
01:28:56,420 --> 01:29:00,243
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm the housing person on this committee, like go housing.

1009
01:29:00,323 --> 01:29:02,825
[SPEAKER_05]: But to me, this feels like a crazy ask.

1010
01:29:02,845 --> 01:29:07,729
[SPEAKER_05]: But I totally appreciate you guys' comments.

1011
01:29:07,769 --> 01:29:09,471
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of where I'm at with this.

1012
01:29:09,491 --> 01:29:12,073
[SPEAKER_08]: To clarify, the $460 is the total cost of the project.

1013
01:29:17,316 --> 01:29:21,239
[SPEAKER_08]: And so their request is the one-to-one match, so it would be half of that kind from the CPC.

1014
01:29:21,679 --> 01:29:22,220
[SPEAKER_08]: The 235.

1015
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:23,040
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

1016
01:29:23,721 --> 01:29:24,041
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

1017
01:29:24,081 --> 01:29:25,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I misread that.

1018
01:29:25,942 --> 01:29:28,284
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I just think we maybe need to see a better budget.

1019
01:29:29,905 --> 01:29:36,870
[SPEAKER_05]: The Gmail from Mr. Go-To-Bed, which is a crazy last name, Mr. Go-To-Bed.

1020
01:29:37,010 --> 01:29:39,212
[SPEAKER_05]: But I just think we need to see harder numbers.

1021
01:29:39,872 --> 01:29:40,092
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1022
01:29:41,734 --> 01:29:42,074
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all.

1023
01:29:42,254 --> 01:29:42,994
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1024
01:29:43,655 --> 01:29:45,676
[SPEAKER_15]: And then also, as a point of clarification,

1025
01:29:46,905 --> 01:29:55,148
[SPEAKER_15]: done some research into what it costs to build affordable housing, and this is actually in line or less than, like the total project cost is less than what it typically takes.

1026
01:29:55,168 --> 01:30:02,810
[SPEAKER_10]: Per unit cost is actually pretty affordable for an affordable housing unit to create an affordable housing unit.

1027
01:30:03,510 --> 01:30:07,412
[SPEAKER_05]: But until, but I feel, I mean, yeah, this is what I do every day.

1028
01:30:08,152 --> 01:30:14,894
[SPEAKER_05]: But until we see actual numbers showing that per unit costs, I mean, I don't know if there's any consideration taken into account, like the cost for

1029
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:21,143
[SPEAKER_05]: the historic aspect of this, all of the huge markups that were going to come with this project.

1030
01:30:26,526 --> 01:30:30,869
[SPEAKER_08]: What we have, what Theresa just pulled up, is the preliminary quote from the builder.

1031
01:30:31,469 --> 01:30:32,509
[SPEAKER_08]: So he's come out.

1032
01:30:32,549 --> 01:30:34,030
[SPEAKER_08]: He's inspected the structure.

1033
01:30:34,050 --> 01:30:37,672
[SPEAKER_08]: So this would be accounting for the historical nature.

1034
01:30:38,053 --> 01:30:43,436
[SPEAKER_08]: I also know that Ryan, our architect, has worked with him on other historical buildings, so has experience

1035
01:30:44,655 --> 01:30:50,993
[SPEAKER_08]: Historic type homes, so just to be clear, this is a specific quote coming from the visit to the.

1036
01:30:56,315 --> 01:31:21,565
[SPEAKER_10]: With respect to administering the long-term deed restriction, I would imagine that the Affordable Housing Trust or the city's affordable housing staff might be able to help to facilitate that, you know, the management of renting the units out, you know, overseeing the affordability restriction.

1037
01:31:22,326 --> 01:31:24,507
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, there might be

1038
01:31:26,550 --> 01:31:30,012
[SPEAKER_10]: there would hopefully be a way to take that off of the homeowner's hands.

1039
01:31:31,313 --> 01:31:36,656
[SPEAKER_07]: I will say that we do monitoring annually for other entities.

1040
01:31:37,697 --> 01:31:48,084
[SPEAKER_15]: We're also aware that this will be a decent amount of investment of our time and energy into figuring out what this is, and being the first ones to try out this model and sort of being guinea pigs with it.

1041
01:31:48,264 --> 01:31:55,048
[SPEAKER_15]: We've been guinea pigs on lots of projects in the past before, and so we're not afraid of being the first people to try this out and see it through.

1042
01:31:55,585 --> 01:32:04,928
[SPEAKER_15]: Also knowing that, right, this is successful and this does work and this is a cost effective way to bring affordable housing in an invisible way into Medford, especially West Medford.

1043
01:32:04,968 --> 01:32:09,669
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that's gonna be something that's really worth the time and is something that we would happily put that effort in for.

1044
01:32:09,689 --> 01:32:11,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1045
01:32:11,629 --> 01:32:12,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Chairman?

1046
01:32:12,550 --> 01:32:14,330
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want one follow up, Teresa.

1047
01:32:14,350 --> 01:32:20,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think that this could potentially be a good project for the Housing Trust to vet and determine funding?

1048
01:32:22,448 --> 01:32:26,750
[SPEAKER_05]: Potentially, with their specialization and knowledge.

1049
01:32:27,590 --> 01:32:29,811
[SPEAKER_07]: We may ask them to consult on this one.

1050
01:32:29,851 --> 01:32:40,295
[SPEAKER_07]: But seeing as this request is half housing, half historic preservation, I would see value in bringing this to them as a consultant when they review this as a courtesy thing.

1051
01:32:41,136 --> 01:32:44,857
[SPEAKER_07]: Would that satisfy your curiosity, Kayleen?

1052
01:32:46,338 --> 01:32:47,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Or are you saying it's a feeling?

1053
01:32:47,798 --> 01:32:49,579
[SPEAKER_05]: I just have concerns about this in general.

1054
01:32:49,639 --> 01:32:50,099
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's OK.

1055
01:32:50,119 --> 01:32:50,479
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.

1056
01:32:50,579 --> 01:32:51,480
[SPEAKER_05]: Move on to Jeremy.

1057
01:32:51,500 --> 01:32:52,020
[SPEAKER_05]: He has a question.

1058
01:32:53,962 --> 01:32:55,523
[SPEAKER_00]: You all actually answered my question.

1059
01:32:55,643 --> 01:32:56,764
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I forgot to lower my hand.

1060
01:32:56,784 --> 01:32:58,386
[SPEAKER_11]: Doug?

1061
01:33:01,188 --> 01:33:06,032
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I think this is uncharted waters for us a little bit.

1062
01:33:06,332 --> 01:33:11,236
[SPEAKER_13]: I've never seen one like this in the time I've been on this board.

1063
01:33:11,857 --> 01:33:19,543
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's interesting to me because I just would note that the per cost unit that we've seen for affordable housing is

1064
01:33:21,034 --> 01:33:23,276
[SPEAKER_13]: is substantially higher than this over the years.

1065
01:33:23,376 --> 01:33:25,617
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been 700, 800,000.

1066
01:33:25,977 --> 01:33:32,962
[SPEAKER_13]: There's an article in Today's Globe that over a million dollars for the ones in Porter Square that are 100% affordable.

1067
01:33:34,202 --> 01:33:36,964
[SPEAKER_13]: That is in the cover of the business section today.

1068
01:33:37,024 --> 01:33:42,047
[SPEAKER_13]: That's just kind of the complexities and the subsidies and the really

1069
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:50,305
[SPEAKER_13]: difficult environment for putting together affordable housing makes it two or three times what a market unit would be.

1070
01:33:50,325 --> 01:34:01,594
[SPEAKER_13]: If I was building a 200-unit apartment building, we'd be building it for 350 grand a unit at market rate, but that's just not the world of affordable housing.

1071
01:34:01,674 --> 01:34:03,976
[SPEAKER_13]: I think this is intriguing to me.

1072
01:34:05,837 --> 01:34:10,881
[SPEAKER_13]: Obviously, there are priorities we need to discuss as a group, but I think it's really worthwhile.

1073
01:34:10,901 --> 01:34:19,226
[SPEAKER_13]: And I do like that it's killing two birds with one stone here, so to speak, in terms of the preservation, which would normally not be enough to get it over the finish line.

1074
01:34:19,286 --> 01:34:23,609
[SPEAKER_13]: But with the public benefit being the unit, I think it probably would.

1075
01:34:24,089 --> 01:34:28,592
[SPEAKER_13]: I think conceptually, I think that it's just different than anything we've seen before.

1076
01:34:33,208 --> 01:34:36,149
[SPEAKER_15]: about the accuracy of the budget or the veracity of it.

1077
01:34:36,970 --> 01:34:38,210
[SPEAKER_15]: We've gotten several quotes.

1078
01:34:38,250 --> 01:34:41,471
[SPEAKER_15]: We've done our best to get an idea, a pretty firm idea of what phase one is.

1079
01:34:41,491 --> 01:34:44,852
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're pretty comfortable with those costs and what those look like.

1080
01:34:45,272 --> 01:34:47,713
[SPEAKER_15]: It's fair to phase two that there's, that's further out.

1081
01:34:47,793 --> 01:34:49,254
[SPEAKER_15]: We haven't done as many quotes on that.

1082
01:34:49,514 --> 01:34:58,177
[SPEAKER_15]: And so if you have a reason to think that our budget's wrong, we offline love to get that feedback and love to get advice on how to increase the accuracy of that,

1083
01:34:59,288 --> 01:35:05,290
[SPEAKER_15]: As homeowners who are looking to make a good decision about going into this, we'd like to make the most amount of information as possible.

1084
01:35:05,650 --> 01:35:10,592
[SPEAKER_15]: So if there's anyone here who has advice on how to improve that, we greatly appreciate that offline.

1085
01:35:10,612 --> 01:35:14,393
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

1086
01:35:14,973 --> 01:35:22,816
[SPEAKER_09]: Just going back to my original question about the unit and the garage, not to obsess about that, but I'm just thinking about creating a support.

1087
01:35:22,956 --> 01:35:24,857
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree with everything Doug just said.

1088
01:35:24,877 --> 01:35:25,997
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a cool idea.

1089
01:35:26,017 --> 01:35:27,858
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys seem like great guinea pigs.

1090
01:35:28,641 --> 01:35:29,521
[SPEAKER_09]: That all seems good.

1091
01:35:30,382 --> 01:35:34,043
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, but I'm just stuck on the one bedroom.

1092
01:35:34,343 --> 01:35:48,428
[SPEAKER_09]: Like that seems like so much effort to put into creating a one bedroom affordable unit versus like, could this be a unit with two bedrooms or that could sustain a family?

1093
01:35:48,828 --> 01:35:50,769
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so that's just where my mind is going.

1094
01:35:50,829 --> 01:35:51,989
[SPEAKER_09]: It just seems like a very

1095
01:35:52,842 --> 01:35:55,783
[SPEAKER_09]: limited outcome to such an energy intensive project.

1096
01:35:55,803 --> 01:35:58,683
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm just curious if there's any like flexibility with that.

1097
01:35:58,703 --> 01:36:11,065
[SPEAKER_09]: And I because I'm not in the affordable housing universe, I'm kind of curious for people who are like, are one bedroom units like standard for an affordable housing development?

1098
01:36:11,125 --> 01:36:13,706
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that the minority of units like I don't actually know?

1099
01:36:13,726 --> 01:36:17,986
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's probably the majority are not bedroom units.

1100
01:36:18,506 --> 01:36:22,127
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's being if it's being considered ADU, then yeah, one bedroom.

1101
01:36:24,072 --> 01:36:28,862
[SPEAKER_09]: Like this is in a neighborhood with like families basically.

1102
01:36:28,982 --> 01:36:32,108
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a need for all bedroom sizes everywhere.

1103
01:36:32,128 --> 01:36:32,569
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1104
01:36:34,558 --> 01:36:40,083
[SPEAKER_07]: If somebody said, hey, I want to build a three-bedroom affordable unit, the city would do backflips.

1105
01:36:40,103 --> 01:36:42,284
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody's building over two bedrooms.

1106
01:36:42,505 --> 01:36:49,951
[SPEAKER_09]: Those West Medford people are going to really get mad about that one.

1107
01:36:50,131 --> 01:36:53,774
[SPEAKER_09]: There's this massive carriage house that's like a block from my house on Thatcher.

1108
01:36:53,794 --> 01:36:54,635
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1109
01:36:54,695 --> 01:36:55,675
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you familiar with that one?

1110
01:36:55,715 --> 01:36:56,916
[SPEAKER_09]: It's so massive.

1111
01:36:57,077 --> 01:37:00,539
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm like, if they built a one-bedroom unit, I would die.

1112
01:37:00,559 --> 01:37:01,981
[SPEAKER_09]: It's so big.

1113
01:37:02,021 --> 01:37:03,262
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's why I'm just, yeah.

1114
01:37:05,328 --> 01:37:06,769
[SPEAKER_15]: No, that's a really good question.

1115
01:37:06,789 --> 01:37:12,711
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think for us, it's sort of, you know, we're, we have a certain amount of money that we spend on this.

1116
01:37:12,791 --> 01:37:21,534
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think because there's other things about stabilizing the structure that grows in scope in terms of the foundation and other things that perhaps the cost of the project too.

1117
01:37:24,435 --> 01:37:25,815
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1118
01:37:26,456 --> 01:37:27,816
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1119
01:37:28,616 --> 01:37:28,837
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1120
01:37:28,917 --> 01:37:30,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a question for you.

1121
01:37:31,137 --> 01:37:32,678
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there existing funding in this now?

1122
01:37:33,698 --> 01:37:35,539
[SPEAKER_08]: There is not plumbing, there's electrical.

1123
01:37:35,899 --> 01:37:42,964
[SPEAKER_08]: I probably have to upgrade the panel for it to be a local structure, but we would need to have water and sewer going to the building.

1124
01:37:43,344 --> 01:37:49,428
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason why I ask is because some years ago, up in the hillside, there was a fire.

1125
01:37:49,448 --> 01:37:54,752
[SPEAKER_02]: A young tough student was living in a carriage house.

1126
01:37:55,432 --> 01:38:00,635
[SPEAKER_02]: The carriage house didn't have any plumbing, had electricity.

1127
01:38:01,656 --> 01:38:02,877
[SPEAKER_02]: The young lady lost her life.

1128
01:38:03,394 --> 01:38:04,015
[SPEAKER_02]: in the fire.

1129
01:38:05,235 --> 01:38:20,987
[SPEAKER_02]: At the after the occurrence, the city said something to the effect they made a resolution that carriage houses could no longer be utilized as domicile.

1130
01:38:21,968 --> 01:38:25,430
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know whether that's ever been changed, to be honest with you.

1131
01:38:25,891 --> 01:38:28,473
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just a suggestion.

1132
01:38:29,093 --> 01:38:32,736
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, before we go through this exercise, please,

1133
01:38:33,757 --> 01:38:37,840
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, find out and we'll probably do some more homework on our own.

1134
01:38:37,900 --> 01:38:45,166
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I don't, I think that that, I don't think that became an ordinance or, you know, codified in the zoning or anything.

1135
01:38:45,206 --> 01:38:51,091
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a guy right next door to me who has a carriage house twice as tall as that.

1136
01:38:51,111 --> 01:38:57,616
[SPEAKER_02]: And he did some renovations and so on and so forth, but they would not allow him to put plumbing back there.

1137
01:38:58,535 --> 01:38:59,916
[SPEAKER_02]: And it wasn't that long ago.

1138
01:39:00,056 --> 01:39:10,345
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just letting you know, because it would be terrible for you to go through all this exercise and then find out, no, you can't do it.

1139
01:39:10,966 --> 01:39:12,247
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be awful.

1140
01:39:12,627 --> 01:39:14,969
[SPEAKER_08]: And I appreciate it.

1141
01:39:15,130 --> 01:39:16,251
[SPEAKER_08]: And we also have Ryan.

1142
01:39:16,271 --> 01:39:23,397
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure if he's on mute, but I know he's also talked to the building department, showed our preliminary architectural plans.

1143
01:39:23,517 --> 01:39:25,479
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we've gotten an initial

1144
01:39:26,022 --> 01:39:28,683
[SPEAKER_08]: sort of indication that this seems possible and feasible.

1145
01:39:29,043 --> 01:39:33,045
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure if you have any comments, Ryan, or if that came up.

1146
01:39:34,846 --> 01:39:50,252
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I'll just add that we were before the building commissioner, and that's one of the reasons why we have to move the building forward off of the lot line, not only to move setback, but to allow clearance on all sides for life safety purposes so the fire department can get to it if need be.

1147
01:39:54,487 --> 01:39:57,891
[SPEAKER_15]: But still, any and all feedback is welcome, and we're looking into it.

1148
01:39:57,911 --> 01:40:06,662
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, if this is... I think the accessory utility unit, when that was passed, I think that basically superseded everything, didn't it?

1149
01:40:06,843 --> 01:40:07,563
[SPEAKER_13]: Didn't it, Teresa?

1150
01:40:07,724 --> 01:40:11,208
[SPEAKER_13]: I would think that's the intent of that legislation, is to...

1151
01:40:12,352 --> 01:40:13,893
[SPEAKER_10]: You're talking about the APU language?

1152
01:40:15,053 --> 01:40:19,914
[SPEAKER_10]: The situation that happened 20 years ago would have been a building that was not up to code.

1153
01:40:20,835 --> 01:40:29,537
[SPEAKER_10]: And so bringing this building up to code would have to meet compliance with... I'll do due diligence.

1154
01:40:29,557 --> 01:40:40,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not find out exactly what the opposition would be, if there were opposition, before they start going down that road?

1155
01:40:43,792 --> 01:40:48,214
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel confident that it's not in effect.

1156
01:40:48,494 --> 01:40:58,756
[SPEAKER_07]: And to Doug's point, the local legislation that passed at the state level would supersede any prohibitive or restrictive local language like that.

1157
01:40:58,896 --> 01:41:06,259
[SPEAKER_07]: Governor Healey signed into law, and gosh, it went into effect January this year, that ADUs are allowable by right.

1158
01:41:07,879 --> 01:41:10,620
[SPEAKER_07]: They have to still meet local zoning setbacks.

1159
01:41:12,111 --> 01:41:14,873
[SPEAKER_07]: plot restrictions, excuse me, I'm losing my voice.

1160
01:41:14,993 --> 01:41:18,296
[SPEAKER_07]: But it would be, I think it would supersede anything.

1161
01:41:18,536 --> 01:41:19,737
[SPEAKER_07]: I will do due diligence.

1162
01:41:20,097 --> 01:41:25,001
[SPEAKER_07]: The other half that I wear for City Hall is the Historic District Commission support person.

1163
01:41:25,021 --> 01:41:26,402
[SPEAKER_07]: So I will find out.

1164
01:41:26,542 --> 01:41:28,463
[SPEAKER_07]: But I feel confident that we're good.

1165
01:41:28,763 --> 01:41:29,564
[SPEAKER_07]: That I should confirm.

1166
01:41:30,785 --> 01:41:31,565
[SPEAKER_07]: Excuse me.

1167
01:41:35,448 --> 01:41:35,848
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1168
01:41:36,049 --> 01:41:39,151
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, any more questions on this project?

1169
01:41:42,018 --> 01:41:42,398
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1170
01:41:42,438 --> 01:41:43,078
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks very much.

1171
01:41:43,198 --> 01:41:49,520
[SPEAKER_10]: I really appreciate your work to envision all of this and to apply it for funding.

1172
01:41:50,040 --> 01:41:50,441
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1173
01:41:50,501 --> 01:41:53,542
[SPEAKER_15]: I really appreciate you taking the time to listen to us and consider our program.

1174
01:41:53,782 --> 01:41:54,062
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1175
01:41:55,282 --> 01:41:59,923
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not a question for them, but just for us to think about.

1176
01:41:59,943 --> 01:42:10,307
[SPEAKER_09]: I have neighbors that just did an ADU project to put the mother in the

1177
01:42:12,070 --> 01:42:14,691
[SPEAKER_09]: converted their garage to an ADU, put the mother in the ADU.

1178
01:42:15,611 --> 01:42:34,397
[SPEAKER_09]: So like, theoretically, if that was a carriage house, and they converted their carriage house, and they abided by the affordable housing deed, whatever, but with the intention of putting their own family member in that unit, would that change things?

1179
01:42:34,897 --> 01:42:35,597
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think

1180
01:42:36,037 --> 01:42:46,200
[SPEAKER_10]: that the requirements for the long-term deed restriction would require an arm's length marketing of the unit.

1181
01:42:46,640 --> 01:42:49,361
[SPEAKER_10]: So you couldn't build that for a family member.

1182
01:42:50,181 --> 01:43:00,444
[SPEAKER_09]: So then we would be essentially preferential to people who were not trying to have intergenerational living.

1183
01:43:03,740 --> 01:43:18,228
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, no, I mean, as a member of the affordable housing trust, I would love to see us be able to create a program that could provide people with funding to build 80 years if they put a.

1184
01:43:19,125 --> 01:43:21,807
[SPEAKER_10]: long term or permanent deed restriction on their unit.

1185
01:43:22,587 --> 01:43:24,929
[SPEAKER_10]: But that program doesn't exist right now.

1186
01:43:25,229 --> 01:43:27,290
[SPEAKER_10]: And so this is a one off request.

1187
01:43:28,351 --> 01:43:44,742
[SPEAKER_10]: And the reason why I think like this is potentially a viable project is because they're looking to make an arm's length, you know, affordable unit that would be kind of the equivalent of an inclusionary unit.

1188
01:43:45,430 --> 01:43:54,257
[SPEAKER_10]: just one singleton unit in the community that the city could help to monitor and market.

1189
01:43:55,358 --> 01:44:01,503
[SPEAKER_09]: Totally, but it's a one-off project, but it's also precedent-setting, so I'm just trying to think through, like, what is the precedent?

1190
01:44:01,763 --> 01:44:09,710
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I think that one of the key things here is that arm's length marketing is the precedent, but I would also

1191
01:44:11,070 --> 01:44:19,216
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, the fact, as I mentioned, the fact that it's historic preservation makes it appropriate to bring to the CPC.

1192
01:44:21,097 --> 01:44:26,601
[SPEAKER_10]: If it wasn't historic preservation, I would rather see it go to the Affordable Housing Trust.

1193
01:44:29,683 --> 01:44:34,326
[SPEAKER_10]: But this is the first time for us to have a project like this.

1194
01:44:34,506 --> 01:44:36,087
[SPEAKER_10]: So you're right, the precedent setting.

1195
01:44:36,107 --> 01:44:39,389
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's a good suggestion that Teresa made to

1196
01:44:42,300 --> 01:44:48,802
[SPEAKER_10]: to consult with the Affordable Housing Trust and think about how can we support each other on this project.

1197
01:44:48,822 --> 01:44:53,044
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to be aware that we have Tim McGovern.

1198
01:44:55,624 --> 01:44:56,405
[SPEAKER_07]: Good conversations.

1199
01:44:56,465 --> 01:44:58,465
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't mean to... Hi, Tim.

1200
01:44:59,706 --> 01:45:02,186
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't mean to... Hi, Tim.

1201
01:45:02,346 --> 01:45:02,806
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you?

1202
01:45:02,826 --> 01:45:03,547
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it 1-1-2-1?

1203
01:45:03,567 --> 01:45:03,627
[SPEAKER_07]: 1-1-5-1.

1204
01:45:03,667 --> 01:45:04,067
[SPEAKER_07]: No, sorry.

1205
01:45:04,087 --> 01:45:04,147
[SPEAKER_07]: 1-1-2-1.

1206
01:45:08,810 --> 01:45:08,910
[SPEAKER_07]: It's 1121.

1207
01:45:09,250 --> 01:45:13,312
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1208
01:45:14,092 --> 01:45:19,994
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm right inside both bathrooms on the third floor, so people are always asking me which code.

1209
01:45:20,394 --> 01:45:19,994
1151.

1210
01:45:20,794 --> 01:45:23,856
[SPEAKER_07]: 1151.

1211
01:45:20,935 --> 01:45:23,856
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, that one I do know.

1212
01:45:23,896 --> 01:45:24,916
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know the ladies one.

1213
01:45:25,236 --> 01:45:26,176
[SPEAKER_07]: It's late, folks.

1214
01:45:26,417 --> 01:45:26,757
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1215
01:45:27,077 --> 01:45:27,657
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Tim.

1216
01:45:28,757 --> 01:45:28,957
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.

1217
01:45:28,997 --> 01:45:29,618
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry to interrupt.

1218
01:45:29,638 --> 01:45:35,200
[SPEAKER_00]: Were we planning a break at any point, or are you trying to power through?

1219
01:45:36,042 --> 01:45:37,462
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, Tim is our last one.

1220
01:45:38,002 --> 01:45:39,803
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so I leave it up to the committee.

1221
01:45:39,823 --> 01:45:44,244
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we want to have a bio break for a few minutes or muscle through?

1222
01:45:44,304 --> 01:45:45,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Power.

1223
01:45:45,544 --> 01:45:46,004
[SPEAKER_05]: Power.

1224
01:45:46,024 --> 01:45:46,304
[SPEAKER_05]: Power.

1225
01:45:46,364 --> 01:45:46,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1226
01:45:46,624 --> 01:45:51,145
[SPEAKER_05]: I have bedtime in 13 minutes I got to get to.

1227
01:45:51,706 --> 01:45:52,226
[SPEAKER_07]: Alrighty.

1228
01:45:53,266 --> 01:45:56,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, the last application of the evening.

1229
01:45:56,847 --> 01:46:02,648
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, um, from DPW, the Oak Grove Cemetery Buildings Preservation.

1230
01:46:03,279 --> 01:46:05,984
[SPEAKER_07]: We are joined by DPW Commissioner Tim McGivern.

1231
01:46:07,065 --> 01:46:08,167
[SPEAKER_07]: Tim, you have the floor.

1232
01:46:09,550 --> 01:46:10,471
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Teresa.

1233
01:46:10,611 --> 01:46:11,571
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, everybody.

1234
01:46:11,871 --> 01:46:14,153
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for hearing me out tonight.

1235
01:46:14,693 --> 01:46:24,740
[SPEAKER_01]: So obviously the number I put in the application package is big, but it's a smaller number compared to a much bigger project.

1236
01:46:25,460 --> 01:46:32,685
[SPEAKER_01]: So the reason I'm going to get to why it's just the service building we're submitting.

1237
01:46:33,886 --> 01:46:38,549
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I want to really get to tonight is just really updating you on where we are on the project, because

1238
01:46:39,307 --> 01:46:43,489
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys have funded the design thus far, so I think it's really important to do that.

1239
01:46:43,769 --> 01:46:45,389
[SPEAKER_01]: 1st, I have a presentation.

1240
01:46:45,409 --> 01:46:51,792
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if Teresa, I can go ahead and share my screen and start it.

1241
01:46:51,972 --> 01:46:54,193
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be an issue.

1242
01:46:54,213 --> 01:46:55,453
[SPEAKER_07]: I just made your sugar.

1243
01:46:57,914 --> 01:46:59,295
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let me just get back to the beginning.

1244
01:47:10,812 --> 01:47:11,572
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, can you see that?

1245
01:47:12,212 --> 01:47:12,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1246
01:47:14,074 --> 01:47:14,274
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1247
01:47:17,175 --> 01:47:17,536
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1248
01:47:17,636 --> 01:47:24,440
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think I recognize, I know many of you, I recognize faces from different boards and commissions.

1249
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:25,781
[SPEAKER_01]: So hello everybody.

1250
01:47:26,301 --> 01:47:33,425
[SPEAKER_01]: So this project is, you know, I'd say right now we're in a big breath, sort of big picture, look at it.

1251
01:47:34,606 --> 01:47:38,048
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the drawing phase is at design development.

1252
01:47:38,068 --> 01:47:39,209
[SPEAKER_01]: We're finishing that up right now.

1253
01:47:40,470 --> 01:47:45,076
[SPEAKER_01]: But we had a meeting on it recently, which spurred a lot of conversation.

1254
01:47:46,158 --> 01:47:49,162
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we're going to start there, but I got a couple of goals for tonight.

1255
01:47:49,182 --> 01:47:51,325
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can.

1256
01:47:53,729 --> 01:47:57,350
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I stated, I want to update this commission on the project in general.

1257
01:47:57,370 --> 01:48:05,673
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to present some progress on what I'm calling operational evaluation, which you'll understand a little bit more about that as we go along.

1258
01:48:06,893 --> 01:48:14,516
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to present to you just a due diligence alternative, because that's where we're at in this project is making sure we're looking at all of our options.

1259
01:48:14,596 --> 01:48:16,617
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all on the table, and we're discussing them intelligently.

1260
01:48:18,077 --> 01:48:22,839
[SPEAKER_01]: And then fourth, review funding and cost considerations for that alternate one.

1261
01:48:25,538 --> 01:48:35,427
[SPEAKER_01]: So start with the project review, as I think many of, you know, the Oak Grove cemetery, the historic section of it, and just the cemetery in general is considered historic.

1262
01:48:36,167 --> 01:48:43,709
[SPEAKER_01]: meets a lot of the check marks for the National Register of Historic Places, including both of these buildings.

1263
01:48:44,429 --> 01:48:50,871
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of information has been given to you guys in the past since we started this project.

1264
01:48:51,791 --> 01:48:55,172
[SPEAKER_01]: We completed a conceptual design and study in 2023.

1265
01:48:55,532 --> 01:49:04,155
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are at the end stages of design development right now, including both buildings.

1266
01:49:05,276 --> 01:49:17,773
[SPEAKER_01]: And that includes a DD plan review, which we started and is underway and we have a DD cost estimate review with the designer foster architecture on October 16th, 2025, which is this Thursday.

1267
01:49:21,287 --> 01:49:26,251
[SPEAKER_01]: This may look familiar if you were on the commission last year, this was the red number.

1268
01:49:26,271 --> 01:49:27,872
[SPEAKER_01]: There was the request last year.

1269
01:49:27,932 --> 01:49:34,397
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't spent that money yet, but that is that's for construction construction documents.

1270
01:49:34,817 --> 01:49:42,583
[SPEAKER_01]: So, basically, where we're at, if you're looking at this is D. D design phase 1, we're at the end of that phase.

1271
01:49:43,304 --> 01:49:45,926
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically completed and as, you know, the.

1272
01:49:46,766 --> 01:49:54,268
[SPEAKER_01]: Continuing construction documents is funded, but we're going to take a pause for the moment before we continue.

1273
01:49:56,529 --> 01:50:02,291
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a reiteration of the historical status in the cover page for the report.

1274
01:50:03,978 --> 01:50:09,803
[SPEAKER_01]: This is also information that I presented to you last time, but we don't have the estimate yet and we'll get it later this week.

1275
01:50:10,183 --> 01:50:23,473
[SPEAKER_01]: But just from discussions, I believe it's going to probably be more since now that they've had a chance to dive in and design things and take a good close look at both buildings from just my.

1276
01:50:24,774 --> 01:50:26,735
[SPEAKER_01]: My gut tells me it's going to be quite a bit more.

1277
01:50:26,795 --> 01:50:27,576
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, maybe not quite a bit.

1278
01:50:27,616 --> 01:50:28,276
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not quite sure.

1279
01:50:28,616 --> 01:50:35,300
[SPEAKER_01]: But the service building or the maintenance building, $6.24 million construction costs.

1280
01:50:35,860 --> 01:50:53,570
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the office or caretaker's building, $1.63 million, $7.87 for the total, which is why the number I put on the application to you folks is the lower number, the $6.24 million number for just the service building.

1281
01:50:57,723 --> 01:51:00,845
[SPEAKER_01]: So just some highlights of the design development plans.

1282
01:51:01,085 --> 01:51:05,547
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't put the whole plan set in the presentation, and they're not even actually final yet.

1283
01:51:05,928 --> 01:51:08,509
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to receive them with the estimates, but I think they're mostly there.

1284
01:51:09,910 --> 01:51:11,191
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some links to those drawings.

1285
01:51:13,792 --> 01:51:14,853
[SPEAKER_01]: questioning brings us there.

1286
01:51:15,593 --> 01:51:36,166
[SPEAKER_01]: Caretaker supporters, the recommendations are, you know, what we would need to do is a complete electrical overhaul, including a new service to the building, and then retrofitting the building for ADA requirements, which is pretty substantial, as well as utility upgrades onto the site, including water, taking a look at sewer, and potentially gas.

1287
01:51:37,967 --> 01:51:40,689
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, those are very expensive things, obviously.

1288
01:51:41,169 --> 01:51:41,870
[SPEAKER_01]: Service building,

1289
01:51:42,999 --> 01:51:48,701
[SPEAKER_01]: The maintenance garage, the most expensive thing on this building is the repair of the cast stone that is falling apart.

1290
01:51:49,482 --> 01:51:55,704
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also there's some significant costs associated with retrofit for ADA requirements for the bathrooms, etc.

1291
01:51:56,685 --> 01:51:58,605
[SPEAKER_01]: And then some utility upgrades for that building as well.

1292
01:52:00,926 --> 01:52:04,288
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the cover sheet showing the team that is working on the project.

1293
01:52:07,641 --> 01:52:14,223
[SPEAKER_01]: Existing conditions, I think, you know, actually, no, this is the new conditions just a shot of the plans.

1294
01:52:15,623 --> 01:52:17,983
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this is the maintenance building plan set.

1295
01:52:19,204 --> 01:52:20,764
[SPEAKER_01]: And a nice elevation of the plan set there.

1296
01:52:20,784 --> 01:52:25,365
[SPEAKER_01]: All right back to the operational evaluation progress.

1297
01:52:25,605 --> 01:52:26,425
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know.

1298
01:52:29,078 --> 01:52:38,860
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things I've been asked to do is take a close look at existing spaces, how they relate to the present and future cemetery operational needs.

1299
01:52:39,360 --> 01:52:42,781
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been trying to dig into that while the design's been going on.

1300
01:52:44,221 --> 01:52:54,323
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that came out of that is the cemetery superintendent, who's the caretaker and lives in the caretaker's quarters, is not something that is needed or is the norm anymore.

1301
01:52:56,703 --> 01:52:59,444
[SPEAKER_01]: The person that's the current superintendent will retire at some point.

1302
01:53:00,184 --> 01:53:05,626
[SPEAKER_01]: And after that, the city doesn't necessarily see a need for a caretaker for the cemetery.

1303
01:53:06,546 --> 01:53:08,487
[SPEAKER_01]: The caretaker would just be for the building at that point.

1304
01:53:08,507 --> 01:53:09,728
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1305
01:53:13,636 --> 01:53:18,958
[SPEAKER_01]: The preservation, and we discovered this a lot during DD, and we've asked a lot of questions about this.

1306
01:53:19,599 --> 01:53:31,484
[SPEAKER_01]: Preserving the service building, the maintenance building, the one we all like, the stone one, doesn't really benefit us or improve our operational needs from that building.

1307
01:53:31,564 --> 01:53:32,745
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit undersized.

1308
01:53:32,805 --> 01:53:34,026
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not modern.

1309
01:53:34,706 --> 01:53:37,087
[SPEAKER_01]: We could never really get it to be like a modern garage.

1310
01:53:38,308 --> 01:53:41,089
[SPEAKER_01]: If we were to build walls to get it to be like a modern garage.

1311
01:53:41,709 --> 01:53:46,553
[SPEAKER_01]: It would make the size smaller and it's already small to begin with on the inside.

1312
01:53:47,074 --> 01:54:00,025
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're learning a lot about how making that building operational for us is maybe not the best use of money because it doesn't really improve our operations at the end of the day.

1313
01:54:00,926 --> 01:54:03,868
[SPEAKER_01]: But it kind of keeps them at status quo and makes them worse.

1314
01:54:04,829 --> 01:54:05,169
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1315
01:54:07,119 --> 01:54:11,803
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just another small thing is that there's a demolished small garage on the site that Pat has left over.

1316
01:54:12,143 --> 01:54:16,027
[SPEAKER_01]: And that provided some needed operational space we need to think about as well.

1317
01:54:17,288 --> 01:54:32,842
[SPEAKER_01]: So part of the due diligence, what we've been asked to look at is, well, what if we move those operational spaces, got rid of the residential portion, and looked at creating a new building with a relatively small office, public counter?

1318
01:54:33,622 --> 01:54:37,145
[SPEAKER_01]: and some municipal garage space for the cemetery crew.

1319
01:54:37,625 --> 01:54:40,467
[SPEAKER_01]: And that may be all of it or a portion of it, I'm not sure.

1320
01:54:41,548 --> 01:54:46,692
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we have to take a close look at this alternative just to get some costs and what some realistic things would look like.

1321
01:54:47,672 --> 01:54:57,339
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, we'd want to preserve the... From my understanding is really most entities involved here want to preserve the service building.

1322
01:54:57,699 --> 01:55:00,642
[SPEAKER_01]: That seems to be the real...

1323
01:55:01,522 --> 01:55:05,284
[SPEAKER_01]: desire, and I understand that.

1324
01:55:05,464 --> 01:55:11,227
[SPEAKER_01]: But we could reduce, minimize the operational space, and that could reduce preservation costs.

1325
01:55:11,808 --> 01:55:18,271
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're not building it like an operational building, if we're building it more as a monument, that could save some costs there.

1326
01:55:19,112 --> 01:55:27,977
[SPEAKER_01]: Build a new building that would include multiple garage bays, small office space, maybe some employee space for muster, things like that, public counter, restrooms.

1327
01:55:29,578 --> 01:55:32,139
[SPEAKER_01]: Potentially, these are all potentials for an alternate to look at.

1328
01:55:33,140 --> 01:55:36,582
[SPEAKER_01]: Any new building will be designed to match the historical significance of the location.

1329
01:55:37,103 --> 01:55:44,428
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think most folks are familiar with how they try to do that, make the new building match what, make it look like it's supposed to be there.

1330
01:55:46,149 --> 01:55:47,430
[SPEAKER_01]: And then raise the caretaker's quarters.

1331
01:55:48,335 --> 01:55:50,738
[SPEAKER_01]: I put that on there just because it's a, it's a cost consideration.

1332
01:55:50,758 --> 01:55:52,560
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be end of life type deal with the building.

1333
01:55:54,102 --> 01:55:56,825
[SPEAKER_01]: But I understand the desire to preserve that building as well.

1334
01:55:59,869 --> 01:56:03,293
[SPEAKER_01]: Then that this, this scheme works with that, but it's more expensive.

1335
01:56:03,713 --> 01:56:07,475
[SPEAKER_01]: to think about taking it down as a full project and turn into a blank slate on that site.

1336
01:56:08,496 --> 01:56:12,458
[SPEAKER_01]: We did explore some, well, what are some alternate uses of the building?

1337
01:56:12,818 --> 01:56:15,760
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, cemetery rules seem pretty strict.

1338
01:56:16,380 --> 01:56:20,142
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing you can use cemetery land for is cemetery uses.

1339
01:56:24,630 --> 01:56:27,831
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a part of this, funding and cost considerations.

1340
01:56:28,051 --> 01:56:30,533
[SPEAKER_01]: So I talked about some of the operational considerations.

1341
01:56:31,893 --> 01:56:35,935
[SPEAKER_01]: These are just, I don't know why the presentation sets it up this way, but they're all kind of independent things.

1342
01:56:35,975 --> 01:56:37,015
[SPEAKER_01]: But they all kind of lead to each other.

1343
01:56:37,035 --> 01:56:38,516
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all reasonable and logical.

1344
01:56:39,056 --> 01:56:45,999
[SPEAKER_01]: The service building, removing operational space, like we talked about, that's a potential for cost reduction.

1345
01:56:46,099 --> 01:56:49,441
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is eligible for CPA funding, from my understanding.

1346
01:56:49,641 --> 01:56:50,901
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's clear.

1347
01:56:52,742 --> 01:56:55,084
[SPEAKER_01]: But the new building would not be eligible for CPA funding.

1348
01:56:55,524 --> 01:56:56,284
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's important.

1349
01:56:56,304 --> 01:57:00,507
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of makes a stark clear line between what is and what isn't.

1350
01:57:00,567 --> 01:57:08,072
[SPEAKER_01]: The city would like to prioritize operational and public building space due to the large backlog of capital expenses.

1351
01:57:08,432 --> 01:57:09,633
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have that on my next slide.

1352
01:57:09,673 --> 01:57:15,737
[SPEAKER_01]: The mayor wanted me to definitely show that to you and help you understand that particular bullet point.

1353
01:57:16,938 --> 01:57:22,741
[SPEAKER_01]: Building a new building will provide better operations at a potential significant cost savings, and potential is important.

1354
01:57:24,502 --> 01:57:31,186
[SPEAKER_01]: There is space on the site to complete a new building before transferring operations, which minimizes schedule-related costs.

1355
01:57:31,926 --> 01:57:36,689
[SPEAKER_01]: A new building minimizes risks associated with renovations on existing structures with unknowns.

1356
01:57:37,129 --> 01:57:43,213
[SPEAKER_01]: A new building means maintaining the existing caretaker's quarters until the superintendent position is vacated.

1357
01:57:44,394 --> 01:57:48,377
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I mentioned, you then have separated project timelines and funding sources.

1358
01:57:48,837 --> 01:57:50,378
[SPEAKER_01]: So the project is bifurcated.

1359
01:57:50,399 --> 01:57:52,640
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what else.

1360
01:57:53,541 --> 01:58:02,367
[SPEAKER_01]: This is that chart that kind of shows the backlog of city spending and what the administration is battling with.

1361
01:58:02,668 --> 01:58:03,488
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not very clear.

1362
01:58:03,608 --> 01:58:04,209
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry about that.

1363
01:58:04,469 --> 01:58:05,350
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm realizing that now.

1364
01:58:05,590 --> 01:58:11,634
[SPEAKER_01]: So I believe it was shared on the social media pages for the city and is on the website and all that.

1365
01:58:14,223 --> 01:58:14,743
[SPEAKER_01]: Next steps.

1366
01:58:16,485 --> 01:58:19,707
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're going to continue our review of the DD plan set and the cost estimate.

1367
01:58:20,508 --> 01:58:23,930
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to complete that operational evaluation.

1368
01:58:24,390 --> 01:58:39,882
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully, we're going to have, while we will, we'll have our architects on board with that discussion and what some potential concepts might be and what might make sense to cost so we can compare it to the preservation efforts.

1369
01:58:42,614 --> 01:58:43,334
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what else.

1370
01:58:43,534 --> 01:58:46,155
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll present to the cemetery board, which we haven't presented this.

1371
01:58:46,195 --> 01:58:50,977
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are the first ones to see this from a presentation standpoint and where we're at.

1372
01:58:51,457 --> 01:58:59,240
[SPEAKER_01]: So this will be put in front of the cemetery board at some point, but wanted to talk to you folks obviously on your schedule.

1373
01:59:03,161 --> 01:59:03,621
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's it.

1374
01:59:03,781 --> 01:59:04,942
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy to take questions.

1375
01:59:05,822 --> 01:59:06,983
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can go back to slides.

1376
01:59:07,063 --> 01:59:07,923
[SPEAKER_01]: I have the plans.

1377
01:59:07,943 --> 01:59:10,704
[SPEAKER_01]: We can take it in whatever direction you folks want to take it.

1378
01:59:13,510 --> 01:59:15,332
[SPEAKER_02]: French?

1379
01:59:15,412 --> 01:59:17,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Brogan, how long before you retire us?

1380
01:59:21,938 --> 01:59:24,200
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you guys see me too, or just the presentation?

1381
01:59:25,041 --> 01:59:25,842
[SPEAKER_07]: We can see you.

1382
01:59:26,402 --> 01:59:27,223
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you hear us?

1383
01:59:27,903 --> 01:59:29,825
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

1384
01:59:29,905 --> 01:59:31,527
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody got really little for me, so.

1385
01:59:32,287 --> 01:59:32,708
[SPEAKER_14]: Interesting.

1386
01:59:34,393 --> 01:59:35,194
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's all good.

1387
01:59:35,214 --> 01:59:36,757
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all good.

1388
01:59:37,558 --> 01:59:44,227
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the answer to your question is is not solid, but have talked to him about this.

1389
01:59:44,548 --> 01:59:48,293
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, he's you know, he doesn't have any sort of hopes for a legacy.

1390
01:59:49,615 --> 01:59:51,496
[SPEAKER_01]: um, successor or anything like that.

1391
01:59:52,196 --> 01:59:56,838
[SPEAKER_01]: And he is planning on retiring, but he doesn't have a date set in stone.

1392
01:59:57,378 --> 02:00:12,324
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is a realistic number there that I'm going to continue to try to pin him down on because that is a cost because we would basically either need to keep the building up to living conditions or we would need to find an apartment for him for the rest of his tenure.

1393
02:00:21,022 --> 02:00:22,983
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a question.

1394
02:00:24,344 --> 02:00:27,845
[SPEAKER_10]: So I understand, Jeremy, you go first.

1395
02:00:27,985 --> 02:00:29,326
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll come back to my question.

1396
02:00:30,567 --> 02:00:31,147
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm sorry.

1397
02:00:31,167 --> 02:00:32,968
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to step away for bedtime.

1398
02:00:33,148 --> 02:00:34,889
[SPEAKER_00]: So I missed a lot of your presentation, Tim.

1399
02:00:34,909 --> 02:00:38,731
[SPEAKER_00]: But would you be willing to share this with us so we can review it?

1400
02:00:38,771 --> 02:00:40,392
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you said it's new.

1401
02:00:41,772 --> 02:00:42,012
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

1402
02:00:42,313 --> 02:00:43,513
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, my intention was to share it.

1403
02:00:43,533 --> 02:00:46,715
[SPEAKER_01]: I was making tweaks right up to when I turned it on.

1404
02:00:46,895 --> 02:00:48,175
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, thank you.

1405
02:00:48,916 --> 02:00:49,116
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

1406
02:00:49,790 --> 02:00:52,531
[SPEAKER_10]: So maybe I'll help to fill in, Jeremy.

1407
02:00:52,551 --> 02:01:14,021
[SPEAKER_10]: So my understanding is that the proposal, the alternatives that you're talking about right now, preserves the utility building and builds a new building that provides for the utilities that we need today, the office space and the operational space.

1408
02:01:14,641 --> 02:01:15,401
[SPEAKER_10]: And then you'll,

1409
02:01:18,077 --> 02:01:20,940
[SPEAKER_10]: you'll demolish the caretaker's building.

1410
02:01:21,661 --> 02:01:27,928
[SPEAKER_10]: What is the future that you envision for the site where the caretaker's building stands right now?

1411
02:01:31,311 --> 02:01:36,076
[SPEAKER_01]: We would, well, I guess we would build it into the hillside.

1412
02:01:36,097 --> 02:01:38,499
[SPEAKER_01]: We would probably try to naturalize it into the hillside.

1413
02:01:39,927 --> 02:01:52,791
[SPEAKER_01]: But also I say that I see, I think we're not even ready to say things like that, though, to tell you the truth, because I think, ideally, from a lay this out perspective, we want to separate the new construction from existing.

1414
02:01:52,831 --> 02:01:55,312
[SPEAKER_01]: So then we can have a nice separation and transfer.

1415
02:01:55,672 --> 02:01:58,373
[SPEAKER_01]: So right across the internal street.

1416
02:01:59,793 --> 02:02:05,397
[SPEAKER_01]: a long place that there's an open space that isn't burial ground that could work for a building.

1417
02:02:05,898 --> 02:02:10,481
[SPEAKER_01]: But we can't rule out at this point using some of the caretaker's building site.

1418
02:02:10,841 --> 02:02:12,523
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that would be bad.

1419
02:02:12,563 --> 02:02:14,504
[SPEAKER_01]: We might need to look at it just to rule it out.

1420
02:02:16,105 --> 02:02:27,414
[SPEAKER_01]: But the vision for alternative one to look at from a cost scenario would be to raise the building, break up the foundation, bury it, loam and seed it, naturalize it, make a hillside there.

1421
02:02:29,235 --> 02:02:41,345
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel like it would be really helpful to have a more finished concept of what the future of this portion of the cemetery is.

1422
02:02:41,365 --> 02:02:50,932
[SPEAKER_10]: If I were on the cemetery board, I would want to know that for sure.

1423
02:02:51,072 --> 02:02:53,895
[SPEAKER_10]: But it feels like it's not ripe to

1424
02:02:54,716 --> 02:03:03,194
[SPEAKER_10]: commit funding to until we know where it's going, unless the funding that you're asking for is to help us get to the place of knowing where it's going.

1425
02:03:05,097 --> 02:03:26,135
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, the funding question is the idea that they're 2 separate projects and if we're preserving the service building as more of a monument than operational space, it separates the schedule from the operational portion of the project and to look at what that could mean from a cost perspective.

1426
02:03:26,495 --> 02:03:30,477
[SPEAKER_01]: But, like I said, it wouldn't be the new building and those new things wouldn't be eligible for CPA.

1427
02:03:30,877 --> 02:03:47,623
[SPEAKER_01]: So, then the only part that's eligible for CPA, I mean, still, it's the major part is preserving of the service building and the city is not able to commit to even a level of funding to for me to bring to report to you for preserving that building.

1428
02:03:48,003 --> 02:04:04,058
[SPEAKER_01]: because the mayor wants to focus on operational employee space buildings and the like, and the price tag is so large for the preservation of both of these buildings that we're being asked to do our due diligence on the cost to do it.

1429
02:04:06,400 --> 02:04:08,703
[SPEAKER_01]: and what it might look like to be a new building.

1430
02:04:09,083 --> 02:04:16,072
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think what they ask is for the CPC to think about what could the CPC commit to preserving this building.

1431
02:04:16,192 --> 02:04:18,295
[SPEAKER_01]: We know approximately how much it's going to cost.

1432
02:04:18,836 --> 02:04:21,219
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to know better on Thursday how much it

1433
02:04:21,659 --> 02:04:24,620
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, cost will have a design development cost estimate.

1434
02:04:25,020 --> 02:04:36,283
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it might be a tad more than what we're showing on the concept design, but it will at least give this commission knowledge of what it might cost to build that building and preserve it the way we'd like to see it.

1435
02:04:37,764 --> 02:04:45,406
[SPEAKER_01]: Compared to obviously your revenue and potential loans, debt service, the city obviously

1436
02:04:46,806 --> 02:04:53,453
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you know, has to take out loans for building projects from what I understand the CPC could as well.

1437
02:04:54,494 --> 02:05:03,642
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we did a lot of discussion about, like, well, what would what would a reasonable contribution look like from the CPC on an annual basis for debt service?

1438
02:05:03,702 --> 02:05:08,747
[SPEAKER_01]: And what would a reasonable contribution look like from the city on a annual debt service affordability type thing?

1439
02:05:08,767 --> 02:05:10,149
[SPEAKER_01]: So we looked at a lot of those scenarios.

1440
02:05:10,869 --> 02:05:17,295
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it came to the kind of conclusions that we did, we had to take a closer look at basically separating the 2 projects.

1441
02:05:17,595 --> 02:05:28,884
[SPEAKER_01]: 1 is a preservation project and 1 is more of an immediate operational need for both employees and public as well as operating the cemetery.

1442
02:05:30,075 --> 02:05:44,038
[SPEAKER_01]: And I should mention, too, that the cemetery board did recently, and I'm not sure if they published it, so to speak, but they have a strategic plan that they've been working on, which I just recently got a copy of from them, which is great to see.

1443
02:05:45,338 --> 02:05:50,239
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, obviously the buildings are on their front and center and part of that plan.

1444
02:05:51,240 --> 02:05:53,080
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, when we.

1445
02:05:54,441 --> 02:05:58,403
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, Roberta, we're also not at a point to show you a drawing with potential spaces.

1446
02:05:58,443 --> 02:06:00,984
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't even know how many square feet we need.

1447
02:06:01,064 --> 02:06:04,706
[SPEAKER_01]: We know roughly how much we think we might need in a building.

1448
02:06:04,986 --> 02:06:10,068
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we kind of know what square footage costs of these type of spaces are running these days.

1449
02:06:10,088 --> 02:06:12,829
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know we have a flat site with pretty good soil.

1450
02:06:13,249 --> 02:06:18,352
[SPEAKER_01]: But we haven't done the design work to know

1451
02:06:19,432 --> 02:06:22,673
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this a $1 million building we're talking about?

1452
02:06:22,693 --> 02:06:23,794
[SPEAKER_01]: A $1.5 million building?

1453
02:06:24,114 --> 02:06:24,734
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure.

1454
02:06:24,754 --> 02:06:28,515
[SPEAKER_01]: I just know that we have feasibility on the site for something like this.

1455
02:06:29,195 --> 02:06:39,679
[SPEAKER_01]: And if preserving a wooden structure, the residential caretaker's building, is going to include a whole bunch of new utilities, gutting the place for electric, and then putting it all back together again.

1456
02:06:39,699 --> 02:06:44,541
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're already up to well over $1 million for that, and I expect it to be higher.

1457
02:06:45,601 --> 02:06:48,122
[SPEAKER_01]: So making sure that we're doing the correct

1458
02:06:49,137 --> 02:06:54,319
[SPEAKER_01]: where the right cost moves on these projects and making sure we're looking at it closely.

1459
02:06:54,339 --> 02:06:55,419
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I meant in the beginning.

1460
02:06:55,459 --> 02:06:58,661
[SPEAKER_01]: We're at the place where, OK, we're seeing design work now.

1461
02:06:58,961 --> 02:07:00,241
[SPEAKER_01]: We're seeing how much this is going to cost.

1462
02:07:00,261 --> 02:07:01,382
[SPEAKER_01]: We're seeing what it looks like.

1463
02:07:01,802 --> 02:07:02,862
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're taking a step back.

1464
02:07:02,902 --> 02:07:03,923
[SPEAKER_01]: We're taking a breath.

1465
02:07:04,403 --> 02:07:08,725
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're bifurcating the projects at this point so we can look at them separately.

1466
02:07:08,745 --> 02:07:10,706
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1467
02:07:11,586 --> 02:07:13,026
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you have another question?

1468
02:07:13,747 --> 02:07:16,768
[SPEAKER_10]: So I could, Doug, go ahead.

1469
02:07:17,595 --> 02:07:21,217
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, finish your question first, Roberta, if you don't mind.

1470
02:07:21,237 --> 02:07:32,842
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would ask a little bit more about what uses could occur in the utility building and or the residential structure.

1471
02:07:33,222 --> 02:07:36,624
[SPEAKER_10]: The utility building, I understand that it doesn't work as a garage.

1472
02:07:36,804 --> 02:07:44,408
[SPEAKER_10]: Could it work as a counter space and office for meeting the public or have a gathering space?

1473
02:07:45,368 --> 02:07:51,393
[SPEAKER_10]: how could we use that building given its constraints that would meet a need for the city?

1474
02:07:52,014 --> 02:08:08,287
[SPEAKER_10]: And then likewise, the residential building, given that we have so few buildings that are city-owned in the building and a need for space, like our capital needs for space for municipal services,

1475
02:08:09,102 --> 02:08:15,944
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there anything compatible with that building that we need, like administrative space, archive space?

1476
02:08:16,384 --> 02:08:23,685
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, archive could potentially be related to the cemetery tangentially.

1477
02:08:23,885 --> 02:08:36,688
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wonder whether there's a need that could be met without tearing that building down, especially if you're able to build your operational building separately.

1478
02:08:38,834 --> 02:08:41,296
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good point, and I don't think it should be ruled out.

1479
02:08:42,257 --> 02:08:46,901
[SPEAKER_01]: All I know is right now the cemetery laws are set up, so it would have to be cemetery use.

1480
02:08:48,922 --> 02:08:54,527
[SPEAKER_01]: But if there's a way to, I think one of the ideas that was floated was, can we parcel out a piece?

1481
02:08:54,927 --> 02:08:55,487
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we can.

1482
02:08:55,968 --> 02:08:57,369
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're asking legal about that.

1483
02:08:57,409 --> 02:09:00,732
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of part of the due diligence to say, well, is it really a raise?

1484
02:09:00,952 --> 02:09:04,995
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we really taking that building down, or are we trying something else with it?

1485
02:09:06,737 --> 02:09:14,205
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, back to the point of why we're looking at the alternate the way we are is because you do have that flexibility without looking at a million different scenarios.

1486
02:09:15,507 --> 02:09:18,890
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why the next step is kind of focusing in the direction that we're taking.

1487
02:09:19,391 --> 02:09:21,814
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully that helps answer the question.

1488
02:09:24,857 --> 02:09:25,278
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks Doug.

1489
02:09:26,219 --> 02:09:49,496
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, Tim and I have actually been communicating a lot lately, because he's starting to develop plans for the seven acres that the Brooks Estate wraps around that was set aside for cemetery expansion in 1998, but now is starting to be looked at seriously by Tim and the group, the commission, excuse me, the board.

1490
02:09:50,401 --> 02:09:52,182
[SPEAKER_13]: So, but there's, there's a lot going on.

1491
02:09:52,202 --> 02:10:02,811
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a lot of moving pieces here, because I see, first of all, I would love that house if there's any way possible just to sell that house and use those funds for things you really need, because you clearly have a massive funding need, right?

1492
02:10:02,831 --> 02:10:10,657
[SPEAKER_13]: When you're looking for upwards of many millions of dollars for what's on the excellent presentation you proposed here.

1493
02:10:11,377 --> 02:10:19,022
[SPEAKER_13]: and then expanding the Oak Grove Cemetery into the other side of the access drive from the Brooks Estate, we always think that's another three plus million dollars.

1494
02:10:19,042 --> 02:10:29,688
[SPEAKER_13]: We're looking at a substantial many millions of dollars for what I believe is probably a cemetery that's got a lifespan, we think 20 years, but maybe not.

1495
02:10:29,808 --> 02:10:37,093
[SPEAKER_13]: Depending on if you do a crematorium or some, I think there's a larger,

1496
02:10:37,933 --> 02:10:39,295
[SPEAKER_13]: I think Roberto was asking you to step back.

1497
02:10:39,315 --> 02:11:00,036
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm thinking I'm asking the same thing, that there's kind of an end game for what's happening at the cemetery that needs to be thought through, you know, for what's happening, what's the actual end date for when there's no more expansion space unless the design changes, you know, and investing, you know, eight or nine million dollars or something that will be

1498
02:11:01,337 --> 02:11:12,729
[SPEAKER_13]: perhaps be at the end of its lifespan in 20 years is something that I think not only this, this board's going to want to know about, but so the city council or the mayor, right?

1499
02:11:12,929 --> 02:11:15,972
[SPEAKER_13]: Because the vision you talked about, that document, I haven't seen it.

1500
02:11:16,012 --> 02:11:18,114
[SPEAKER_13]: It was emailed, but I haven't had a chance to read it yet.

1501
02:11:18,195 --> 02:11:20,837
[SPEAKER_13]: I think this is a real opportunity to think about

1502
02:11:22,919 --> 02:11:34,065
[SPEAKER_13]: the entire cemetery globally, what's happening here, to make sure that the design of the expansion is consistent with what you're thinking for the whole parcel, the whole property.

1503
02:11:35,265 --> 02:11:36,666
[SPEAKER_13]: Because there's so many moving parts here.

1504
02:11:36,686 --> 02:11:39,168
[SPEAKER_13]: I commend you because you've got a great preservation architect.

1505
02:11:39,208 --> 02:11:40,328
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a great step forward.

1506
02:11:40,348 --> 02:11:43,170
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm glad we funded this piece because you needed this.

1507
02:11:43,810 --> 02:11:51,733
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think now that you have it, you've got to think, okay, now that I know all the pieces and all the costs, what are we really doing with all this?

1508
02:11:51,813 --> 02:12:04,657
[SPEAKER_13]: I think there's one more step here to kind of say, okay, we have to make choices here on this site, this site, this site, this house, this property, historic, yes, functional, no.

1509
02:12:05,198 --> 02:12:08,779
[SPEAKER_13]: Now you have all the knowledge and the costs where you're going to have it this week.

1510
02:12:08,979 --> 02:12:11,380
[SPEAKER_13]: I think there's an incredible opportunity here to now think about

1511
02:12:15,395 --> 02:12:16,715
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't forget though, don't forget.

1512
02:12:16,775 --> 02:12:22,838
[SPEAKER_01]: So the end game isn't just done selling plots because the historic part of the cemetery.

1513
02:12:22,878 --> 02:12:23,938
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we still maintain.

1514
02:12:23,978 --> 02:12:24,698
[SPEAKER_01]: We still go up there.

1515
02:12:24,738 --> 02:12:25,579
[SPEAKER_01]: People still visit it.

1516
02:12:25,939 --> 02:12:28,300
[SPEAKER_01]: So the operational needs of the cemetery don't go away.

1517
02:12:28,800 --> 02:12:32,641
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if we're done selling plots, even if we're done bearing, we still have operational needs.

1518
02:12:32,661 --> 02:12:33,241
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't forget that.

1519
02:12:33,621 --> 02:12:34,482
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, don't forget that.

1520
02:12:35,802 --> 02:12:39,546
[SPEAKER_01]: We are thinking in a sense that, well, we don't really need a caretaker at our cemetery anymore.

1521
02:12:39,666 --> 02:12:44,109
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's also a step in the direction of bringing our operations of our cemetery down.

1522
02:12:44,770 --> 02:12:50,375
[SPEAKER_01]: When I talk about a new building, I'm talking about looking at a scenario for cost purposes.

1523
02:12:50,555 --> 02:12:53,497
[SPEAKER_01]: If it turns out that a new building is going to cost us, you know.

1524
02:12:54,839 --> 02:13:02,267
[SPEAKER_01]: A 1,000,008 and save us 6 months, but we're still at 1.2 for renovation, renovating the structure.

1525
02:13:02,327 --> 02:13:08,774
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, you know, we're, we're in firm ground for, like, you know, back to preserving that structure again.

1526
02:13:08,934 --> 02:13:10,676
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but right now, you know.

1527
02:13:12,077 --> 02:13:13,899
[SPEAKER_01]: from an operational need, we don't need that building.

1528
02:13:14,159 --> 02:13:15,500
[SPEAKER_01]: Selling it is an option, too.

1529
02:13:15,520 --> 02:13:20,604
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be a nice plus black mark on the balance sheet for the project.

1530
02:13:21,185 --> 02:13:23,426
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't know how feasible that is, to tell you the truth.

1531
02:13:24,567 --> 02:13:25,528
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking at it.

1532
02:13:26,089 --> 02:13:33,395
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think there's some repercussions if you go in the reverse of land protection, especially for cemeteries.

1533
02:13:33,455 --> 02:13:34,916
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're not even sure it's feasible.

1534
02:13:34,936 --> 02:13:37,118
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a way to do it.

1535
02:13:37,158 --> 02:13:40,200
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're looking at that at the moment.

1536
02:13:41,443 --> 02:13:56,381
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but I, you know, I think, I think the cemetery is there to stay for a long time and whatever we do there needs to be lasting because I think we're going to have employees and visitors there for the time being.

1537
02:13:57,382 --> 02:13:57,623
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1538
02:13:58,678 --> 02:14:07,641
[SPEAKER_10]: One suggestion, if you do explore the possibility of selling it, you would want to sell it with a permanent preservation restriction already attached.

1539
02:14:07,721 --> 02:14:20,204
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's one way in which you're giving up a restriction, but you're also placing a new restriction on it so that it would remain the landmark that it already is.

1540
02:14:20,864 --> 02:14:22,405
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'd be trading.

1541
02:14:24,285 --> 02:14:37,449
[SPEAKER_10]: an operational cemetery building for a permanently preserved landmark, rather than giving up a landmark in order to keep it as a cemetery space.

1542
02:14:38,609 --> 02:14:47,671
[SPEAKER_10]: So there might be, I think, an argument for why it would be palatable to give up that restriction.

1543
02:14:52,358 --> 02:14:55,079
[SPEAKER_10]: a person who wants to buy a house next to a cemetery.

1544
02:14:55,399 --> 02:14:56,540
[SPEAKER_10]: You know who made Good Neighbors?

1545
02:15:05,143 --> 02:15:11,366
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it sounds as though like the cemetery strategic plan is really a critical piece of this.

1546
02:15:11,726 --> 02:15:19,729
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would love to see that be a public document like that, that there be an opportunity for the

1547
02:15:21,963 --> 02:15:26,144
[SPEAKER_10]: for the neighborhood to provide some feedback.

1548
02:15:26,504 --> 02:15:30,565
[SPEAKER_10]: This isn't just a plan for how to sell cemetery plots.

1549
02:15:30,645 --> 02:15:42,527
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a plan for whether the landmark buildings that are the core of what you see from the street are going to be here in the future or are going to be torn down.

1550
02:15:42,667 --> 02:15:48,308
[SPEAKER_10]: I would think that the community would want to have some

1551
02:15:50,693 --> 02:15:56,501
[SPEAKER_10]: Some input or at least understanding of how we get to the decision that we make.

1552
02:15:58,363 --> 02:16:01,046
[SPEAKER_10]: We make, you make.

1553
02:16:01,147 --> 02:16:06,834
[SPEAKER_10]: We're making a funding decision, but you're making a decision about what the future of the community looks like.

1554
02:16:09,492 --> 02:16:17,120
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think there's a another check in with this group at some point, because, like, I'm saying, like, I was saying before, I'll make my rounds.

1555
02:16:17,160 --> 02:16:18,202
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go to the cemetery board.

1556
02:16:18,222 --> 02:16:23,588
[SPEAKER_01]: They're gonna have lots of questions related to this strategic plan.

1557
02:16:24,008 --> 02:16:27,552
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a, there is, you know, the idea that.

1558
02:16:30,325 --> 02:16:48,606
[SPEAKER_01]: the folks out there, the people, the residents, the community should really understand what the costs are associated with preserving these spaces and how to balance the operational needs with the historic preservation piece and how to best do that.

1559
02:16:48,726 --> 02:16:49,707
[SPEAKER_01]: So I completely agree.

1560
02:16:50,047 --> 02:16:53,088
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think any one of us knows exactly where that line should be drawn.

1561
02:16:53,548 --> 02:17:01,471
[SPEAKER_01]: But ideally, it's a community discussion that says, hey, politicians, here's where we want the line to be.

1562
02:17:02,231 --> 02:17:03,832
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm with you there.

1563
02:17:04,612 --> 02:17:09,934
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I can say, though, is that I feel like there's a lot of this is sort of cutting edge.

1564
02:17:10,054 --> 02:17:17,496
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're at the point where we know we can say, I think it's healthier to look at the buildings.

1565
02:17:20,051 --> 02:17:24,692
[SPEAKER_01]: separately, know that one of them has the potential to be a monument.

1566
02:17:25,212 --> 02:17:29,693
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them, the Wood Frame Caretaker's Quarters, has an unknown future.

1567
02:17:30,313 --> 02:17:32,574
[SPEAKER_01]: What do the cost scenarios look like for that?

1568
02:17:33,514 --> 02:17:34,954
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it feasible to sell it or not?

1569
02:17:35,634 --> 02:17:37,635
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it is, how does that change the game?

1570
02:17:38,195 --> 02:17:45,316
[SPEAKER_01]: What is a new building cost right across the street that is going to meet operational needs or improve them?

1571
02:17:49,397 --> 02:17:53,238
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and how does that integrate with with the preservation of the site?

1572
02:17:53,258 --> 02:17:56,799
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, lots of good questions to answer as we kind of move along.

1573
02:17:56,899 --> 02:17:57,099
[SPEAKER_01]: So.

1574
02:17:59,780 --> 02:18:07,262
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much for your time and for your diligence and asking and answering all of these really big questions.

1575
02:18:08,781 --> 02:18:17,405
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and hopefully we'll have more answers as we go and I'll give Teresa an update on the DD drawings and the cost estimate.

1576
02:18:17,485 --> 02:18:22,447
[SPEAKER_01]: And I invited her to the meeting too, so she can stay on the cutting edge of this project as well.

1577
02:18:23,888 --> 02:18:24,708
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for that.

1578
02:18:27,330 --> 02:18:27,790
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1579
02:18:28,650 --> 02:18:30,591
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, thanks everybody.

1580
02:18:30,771 --> 02:18:32,472
[SPEAKER_06]: Go home.

1581
02:18:33,152 --> 02:18:33,973
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1582
02:18:34,373 --> 02:18:36,034
[SPEAKER_01]: This was easier than traffic commission tonight.

1583
02:18:37,217 --> 02:18:39,299
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1584
02:18:39,359 --> 02:18:40,540
[SPEAKER_09]: What a fun life you live.

1585
02:18:40,620 --> 02:18:43,462
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, it's awesome.

1586
02:18:43,863 --> 02:18:48,947
[SPEAKER_13]: See ya.

1587
02:18:48,987 --> 02:18:49,888
[SPEAKER_13]: Did I read that right?

1588
02:18:50,008 --> 02:18:51,729
[SPEAKER_13]: They're asking for $6 million?

1589
02:18:51,749 --> 02:18:56,173
[SPEAKER_13]: 6 point, like 2.8 times our budget?

1590
02:18:57,514 --> 02:18:58,314
[SPEAKER_13]: Isn't that a bond?

1591
02:18:59,075 --> 02:18:59,976
[SPEAKER_10]: That is, yeah.

1592
02:18:59,996 --> 02:19:01,537
[SPEAKER_10]: They would be talking about a bond.

1593
02:19:01,557 --> 02:19:01,617
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

1594
02:19:03,399 --> 02:19:03,599
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1595
02:19:04,255 --> 02:19:10,236
[SPEAKER_07]: and whether we could carry that debt service, to which the answer is no.

1596
02:19:11,097 --> 02:19:20,899
[SPEAKER_07]: It was estimated that if we were to bond this out in its entirety, that estimate would be about $750,000 to $800,000 a year.

1597
02:19:21,759 --> 02:19:25,460
[SPEAKER_07]: So we do have a budget that technically could cover that.

1598
02:19:27,201 --> 02:19:31,042
[SPEAKER_10]: But that might not be the only project that we want to fund for the next 20 years.

1599
02:19:31,182 --> 02:19:31,502
[SPEAKER_10]: Correct.

1600
02:19:33,608 --> 02:19:34,808
[SPEAKER_07]: So there is runway.

1601
02:19:37,309 --> 02:19:41,130
[SPEAKER_07]: But I just want to be sensitive to the time, because it's 9 o'clock.

1602
02:19:43,511 --> 02:19:45,052
[SPEAKER_07]: The meeting minute, I'm sorry, Roberta.

1603
02:19:45,072 --> 02:19:45,892
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's all right.

1604
02:19:46,032 --> 02:19:48,673
[SPEAKER_07]: Meeting minutes for September 9.

1605
02:19:48,873 --> 02:19:52,534
[SPEAKER_07]: You may have noticed that there was an attachment in the Dropbox.

1606
02:19:53,495 --> 02:19:56,556
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw it, and I thought, oh, Teresa already did those minutes.

1607
02:19:56,616 --> 02:19:56,876
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

1608
02:19:57,216 --> 02:19:59,216
[SPEAKER_07]: So I do not have meeting minutes for tonight.

1609
02:19:59,377 --> 02:20:00,097
[SPEAKER_07]: I apologize.

1610
02:20:01,212 --> 02:20:04,114
[SPEAKER_07]: I put a placeholder and then completely forgot to actually follow up on that.

1611
02:20:04,514 --> 02:20:05,715
[SPEAKER_07]: I will have them for next meeting.

1612
02:20:05,735 --> 02:20:09,277
[SPEAKER_07]: Eric's kissed.

1613
02:20:10,157 --> 02:20:11,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Administrative updates.

1614
02:20:13,339 --> 02:20:18,542
[SPEAKER_07]: I only had, you know, I was today asked if this board would be interested in tabling.

1615
02:20:19,682 --> 02:20:24,183
[SPEAKER_07]: at the November 1st Pumpkin Smash event, which is a fun event.

1616
02:20:25,103 --> 02:20:28,164
[SPEAKER_07]: It's over at the West Medford Community Center, I believe, again this year.

1617
02:20:28,204 --> 02:20:28,724
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's not.

1618
02:20:28,944 --> 02:20:29,324
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not?

1619
02:20:29,384 --> 02:20:30,485
[SPEAKER_07]: It's at the McGlynn Elementary.

1620
02:20:30,505 --> 02:20:32,065
[SPEAKER_07]: It's at the McGlynn Elementary School.

1621
02:20:32,365 --> 02:20:36,226
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the Saturday after Halloween, 1030 to 1.

1622
02:20:36,266 --> 02:20:44,248
[SPEAKER_07]: I have not obligated us to attend, but if anybody has a burning desire

1623
02:20:45,485 --> 02:20:47,446
[SPEAKER_07]: to table at that particular event.

1624
02:20:47,586 --> 02:20:53,227
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a composting event for, you bring your jack-o-lanterns and you smash them, and it's a lot of fun.

1625
02:20:55,588 --> 02:20:57,348
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a really fantastic event.

1626
02:20:57,388 --> 02:20:57,689
[SPEAKER_09]: You're right.

1627
02:20:57,709 --> 02:20:58,869
[SPEAKER_09]: You're selling it.

1628
02:20:59,209 --> 02:20:59,789
[SPEAKER_09]: I know I am.

1629
02:20:59,809 --> 02:21:03,730
[SPEAKER_09]: Imagine axe throwing at pumpkins with lots of children running around.

1630
02:21:05,051 --> 02:21:06,611
[SPEAKER_09]: So do we want to table at that?

1631
02:21:07,371 --> 02:21:09,252
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm still parenting my weekend, so I cannot.

1632
02:21:09,612 --> 02:21:10,712
[SPEAKER_09]: But I might be willing.

1633
02:21:10,792 --> 02:21:11,252
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not.

1634
02:21:11,593 --> 02:21:11,913
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

1635
02:21:11,973 --> 02:21:12,933
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll take it offline.

1636
02:21:13,490 --> 02:21:37,268
[SPEAKER_07]: yeah i'll circulate it but you know just put it out there i'm a little burnt out um but it is it is the season yeah and this would be probably the last one of the season so um but i'll just put in the see if anybody's really loving that idea let me know but i'll email it around and i promise that's all i have for administrative updates truce i have a quick question for you i see there's a

1637
02:21:38,133 --> 02:21:40,374
[SPEAKER_00]: the COVID memorial folder in there.

1638
02:21:40,414 --> 02:21:42,374
[SPEAKER_00]: Will we review that next time?

1639
02:21:43,134 --> 02:21:45,075
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I apologize.

1640
02:21:45,115 --> 02:21:50,316
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I mentioned that right out the gate, but the planning department has that project.

1641
02:21:50,376 --> 02:21:53,157
[SPEAKER_07]: They have asked if they can present at their November meeting.

1642
02:21:53,717 --> 02:22:03,639
[SPEAKER_07]: They had a community outreach event, which I went to, and Roberta as well, and they're taking some of that feedback so that

1643
02:22:04,439 --> 02:22:06,861
[SPEAKER_07]: Application is going to stay pretty solid.

1644
02:22:06,941 --> 02:22:09,103
[SPEAKER_07]: The design may tweak a little bit.

1645
02:22:09,623 --> 02:22:11,244
[SPEAKER_07]: And with that, the funding request.

1646
02:22:11,545 --> 02:22:13,806
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's largely not changing too much.

1647
02:22:13,846 --> 02:22:17,249
[SPEAKER_07]: But they just asked if we can punch them to November's meeting.

1648
02:22:17,269 --> 02:22:18,850
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1649
02:22:19,491 --> 02:22:19,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1650
02:22:19,871 --> 02:22:23,194
[SPEAKER_07]: And if anybody has feedback on that one, let me know.

1651
02:22:25,776 --> 02:22:30,560
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like for November's meeting, if it's going to go late, we should put the punchy live people at the end.

1652
02:22:30,780 --> 02:22:30,860
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

1653
02:22:32,560 --> 02:22:34,922
[SPEAKER_09]: And the drive-in presentation first.

1654
02:22:35,202 --> 02:22:35,963
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

1655
02:22:36,063 --> 02:22:39,226
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we have a mix of Zoom and in-person.

1656
02:22:39,266 --> 02:22:39,506
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

1657
02:22:39,946 --> 02:22:40,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1658
02:22:42,008 --> 02:22:44,610
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think those projects won't be as intensive.

1659
02:22:44,630 --> 02:22:47,432
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a lot of continuation.

1660
02:22:47,692 --> 02:22:48,613
[SPEAKER_07]: There's one project.

1661
02:22:48,633 --> 02:22:50,114
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, we can get ahead of ourselves.

1662
02:22:50,234 --> 02:22:51,495
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's 855.

1663
02:22:51,795 --> 02:22:52,156
