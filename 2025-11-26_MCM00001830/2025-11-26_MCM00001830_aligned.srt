1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,804
We are calling to order the Medford Community Preservation Committee on Tuesday, October 14, 2025, 6.30 p.m.

2
00:00:04,824 --> 00:00:09,088
We are meeting hybrid with some of us being located in room 201 of Medford City Hall and some of us arriving via Zoom.

3
00:00:26,223 --> 00:00:33,668
Uh, the meeting is recorded and, um, there will be, uh, reporting will be made available as soon as possible afterwards.

4
00:00:33,948 --> 00:00:34,209
Yes.

5
00:00:34,809 --> 00:00:41,954
So our agenda this evening is, uh, first of all, I'm going to call roll so that we know who we have here in the committee members.

6
00:00:42,154 --> 00:00:44,195
I'll start with the people in room 201.

7
00:00:44,556 --> 00:00:44,876
Reg.

8
00:00:44,896 --> 00:00:45,376
Here.

9
00:00:45,836 --> 00:00:46,777
Rosa.

10
00:00:47,157 --> 00:00:47,397
Ada.

11
00:00:47,518 --> 00:00:47,798
Here.

12
00:00:48,658 --> 00:00:49,839
And online we have Doug.

13
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:50,800
Here.

14
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,061
Jeremy.

15
00:00:52,661 --> 00:00:52,941
Here.

16
00:00:54,022 --> 00:00:54,642
Mylesha.

17
00:00:55,383 --> 00:00:55,523
Here.

18
00:00:56,444 --> 00:00:56,864
Haley?

19
00:00:57,324 --> 00:00:57,604
Here.

20
00:00:58,785 --> 00:01:00,205
We know that we're missing Joan.

21
00:01:00,245 --> 00:01:01,346
Are we missing anyone else?

22
00:01:01,806 --> 00:01:02,046
Ari.

23
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:03,266
And Ari.

24
00:01:04,266 --> 00:01:04,687
All right.

25
00:01:05,487 --> 00:01:18,031
So the agenda for this evening is to listen to presentations from half of our applicants for the FY26 funding round.

26
00:01:19,591 --> 00:01:25,453
We've received, what, like 12 applications, something like that?

27
00:01:26,142 --> 00:01:26,602
Yeah, 14.

28
00:01:28,023 --> 00:01:28,803
14 applications.

29
00:01:28,983 --> 00:01:34,665
So more applications than we are able to schedule presentations in one evening.

30
00:01:35,265 --> 00:01:46,909
So what we're going to be doing is listening to presentations, give us an introduction, and maybe three to five minutes of

31
00:01:49,383 --> 00:02:12,414
of explanation of your project and then committee members will ask questions and that will give us information so that next month, actually in December, the committee can get back together again and start to process all of that information that we heard of this presentation and to deliberate.

32
00:02:13,575 --> 00:02:18,117
Is there anything else that I need to add before we get started with our presentations?

33
00:02:19,509 --> 00:02:20,809
Just one quick note.

34
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,350
Nevermind, I did take it off.

35
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:27,611
Sorry, there was an application that we were going to hear tonight.

36
00:02:27,711 --> 00:02:29,811
I thought I had left it on there, but nevermind.

37
00:02:29,851 --> 00:02:32,172
That's been postponed to November.

38
00:02:32,192 --> 00:02:34,032
So I think we're good.

39
00:02:34,272 --> 00:02:34,572
Okay.

40
00:02:35,232 --> 00:02:37,433
So should I go in the order?

41
00:02:37,453 --> 00:02:38,873
I think so, yes.

42
00:02:39,233 --> 00:02:39,613
Okay.

43
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:43,854
And we have Veterans Affairs Director Veronica Shaw.

44
00:02:44,014 --> 00:02:44,695
Come on down.

45
00:02:44,715 --> 00:02:45,855
Do you want to come right up on here?

46
00:02:46,115 --> 00:02:46,235
Sure.

47
00:02:49,847 --> 00:02:57,950
And for that application information here, we just want to talk to you.

48
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:58,790
Thank you.

49
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,051
She's better than me, folks.

50
00:03:00,091 --> 00:03:01,871
You guys are both fantastic.

51
00:03:20,257 --> 00:03:22,038
All right, so I am Veronica Shaw.

52
00:03:22,178 --> 00:03:24,819
I am the Director of Veterans Services for the City.

53
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:30,963
My office is in the Arctic tundra.

54
00:03:32,024 --> 00:03:40,649
So my request is for funding to fix the Angel of Victory and Peace that is in Oak Grove Cemetery.

55
00:03:40,669 --> 00:03:46,072
She is the fountain that overlooks the World War II section.

56
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,781
There she is.

57
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:49,961
And you have a picture of her.

58
00:03:49,981 --> 00:03:52,483
So I took this picture on Memorial Day.

59
00:03:53,263 --> 00:03:57,746
And it's significant because you see in the picture that she is full.

60
00:03:57,766 --> 00:03:58,966
Her fountain is full.

61
00:03:59,446 --> 00:04:00,267
She is pumping.

62
00:04:00,287 --> 00:04:11,833
However, it is all artificial because when they built the section behind her, the drainage system was destroyed.

63
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:16,296
And so the angel is no longer a functioning fountain.

64
00:04:19,785 --> 00:04:22,507
So I just want to give you a little bit of background.

65
00:04:22,587 --> 00:04:32,734
So the angel was created and dedicated by Emilius Ciampa, who was a World War I veteran and a Medford resident.

66
00:04:33,135 --> 00:04:39,119
He was actually born in Italy and came over.

67
00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:46,925
He is also the same creator of the World War I statue that is in the World War I section.

68
00:04:47,612 --> 00:04:51,454
He also did some other plaques that are in the Chevalier Theatre.

69
00:04:53,695 --> 00:04:57,696
And he and actually Chevalier were in one together.

70
00:04:59,077 --> 00:05:02,578
So the angel actually stopped working more than 37 years ago.

71
00:05:02,618 --> 00:05:04,139
We don't have an exact date.

72
00:05:05,019 --> 00:05:14,323
We're basing that off of when Steve Brogan, who is the caretaker, when he started working, he's been there 37 years, he said she has not been working since he's been here.

73
00:05:15,777 --> 00:05:22,843
So what needs to happen for her is first, this is not a maintenance request.

74
00:05:22,943 --> 00:05:25,004
We're not asking for funds to keep her up.

75
00:05:25,385 --> 00:05:27,786
We're just asking for funds to get her working.

76
00:05:28,867 --> 00:05:33,711
Funds for maintenance will come from my budget and from DPW.

77
00:05:34,572 --> 00:05:41,697
So what we need are is the funds to actually get her insides working and the drainage and the plumbing outside of the common market.

78
00:05:45,438 --> 00:05:48,841
She needs a new filtration system and a new drainage system.

79
00:05:49,241 --> 00:05:55,806
And I have included in her packets the proposal from the company that we have found to do the work.

80
00:05:56,967 --> 00:05:58,909
And for those folks, I'm sorry to interrupt.

81
00:05:58,949 --> 00:05:59,409
No, go ahead.

82
00:05:59,689 --> 00:06:02,492
That is in the Dropbox meeting packet as well.

83
00:06:02,832 --> 00:06:04,133
So you can follow along there.

84
00:06:04,313 --> 00:06:07,836
I can drop the link in the chat if that's helpful.

85
00:06:08,536 --> 00:06:10,678
And so what the total, and you have

86
00:06:11,474 --> 00:06:15,095
Also, in my application, we're asking for a total of $193,000.

87
00:06:15,436 --> 00:06:23,498
That does include a contingency for any increase to materials that we did need.

88
00:06:23,518 --> 00:06:27,680
It is a significant amount, but this is sort of a one and done.

89
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:28,800
We've got it from there.

90
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:33,022
Once she is fixed, we will take over her maintenance every year.

91
00:06:34,262 --> 00:06:38,004
And so I think I really want to focus on why this is important.

92
00:06:38,184 --> 00:06:39,124
I know that when you

93
00:06:40,377 --> 00:06:43,659
People go into the cemetery and say, oh, it's a really pretty angel.

94
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,821
But it's what she represents.

95
00:06:46,121 --> 00:06:56,769
For me as a veteran, when I walk in there, it's like seeing all of our veterans being recognized.

96
00:06:57,109 --> 00:06:58,731
She's there as a symbol.

97
00:06:58,871 --> 00:07:01,773
I have courage, sacrifice, and community pride.

98
00:07:02,774 --> 00:07:05,716
Champis was a Medford resident.

99
00:07:05,776 --> 00:07:07,037
He was a World War I hero.

100
00:07:09,243 --> 00:07:15,105
And he created this statue, this fountain, to honor all of us, all of the veterans from Medford.

101
00:07:16,806 --> 00:07:18,506
It's a legacy worth preserving.

102
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:26,549
When she goes, there's nothing left in that cemetery to watch over our veterans.

103
00:07:27,049 --> 00:07:28,930
And she is, she's watching over them.

104
00:07:32,651 --> 00:07:34,392
She's a symbol of remembrance.

105
00:07:35,552 --> 00:07:37,933
For me, as part of my job is,

106
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:43,021
I work alongside Steve to take care of the veterans' graves.

107
00:07:43,742 --> 00:07:50,924
And one of the things I spoke about several times over the past two years that I've been here is remembering our veterans.

108
00:07:51,564 --> 00:07:54,045
It's not a one day a year.

109
00:07:54,225 --> 00:07:58,506
It's an ongoing thing that we need to be remembering our veterans every single day.

110
00:07:58,526 --> 00:08:04,848
And having her working is just another way of people being able to drive by and say, yep,

111
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:06,424
Those are our veterans.

112
00:08:06,824 --> 00:08:08,645
They're what make Medford proud.

113
00:08:10,466 --> 00:08:13,548
And it's a matter of respect.

114
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:19,892
We come in there every year to do our ceremony, and I'm over there every month doing my walkthroughs.

115
00:08:20,473 --> 00:08:21,754
It's just a matter of respect.

116
00:08:21,914 --> 00:08:25,616
She hasn't worked in at least 37 years.

117
00:08:25,636 --> 00:08:31,240
A veteran created her for Medford, and she's not working.

118
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:37,192
And so I am asking for the funds to get her working to make Medford proud and make our veterans proud.

119
00:08:39,713 --> 00:08:40,273
Thank you.

120
00:08:40,293 --> 00:08:41,534
Thank you.

121
00:08:41,714 --> 00:08:44,495
Are there questions, comments from committee members?

122
00:08:48,196 --> 00:08:48,596
Kaylee.

123
00:08:50,117 --> 00:08:51,077
Thank you for that presentation.

124
00:08:51,117 --> 00:08:51,837
That was really nice.

125
00:08:52,597 --> 00:08:55,158
I live in the neighborhood, and I walk through the cemetery all the time.

126
00:08:55,318 --> 00:08:57,639
And I always notice that statue, and I always wonder why it's not working.

127
00:08:57,739 --> 00:08:58,600
So that was very informative.

128
00:09:00,071 --> 00:09:02,453
Did you get any other prices?

129
00:09:02,493 --> 00:09:04,574
Did you just get that one contractor?

130
00:09:04,594 --> 00:09:09,497
So we just got this one because it's a specialist that needs to do it.

131
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,538
Yes, I could do.

132
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:24,267
So this is a specialist that deals exclusively with restoration projects and water fixtures.

133
00:09:24,587 --> 00:09:29,310
So this was these people have worked with the city before on other

134
00:09:30,395 --> 00:09:30,995
project.

135
00:09:31,015 --> 00:09:35,078
So this was who Steve chose to go with.

136
00:09:36,198 --> 00:09:36,398
Yeah.

137
00:09:36,418 --> 00:09:40,821
And I mean, obviously there's a lot of value in going with the professional and somebody who knows it and will do the job right.

138
00:09:40,841 --> 00:09:43,702
I was just asking because it is pretty pricey.

139
00:09:44,943 --> 00:09:53,268
And as a public entity, you know, I don't know, is the city required to get other pricing or a couple of different proposals or?

140
00:09:54,155 --> 00:09:55,336
Yeah, this would be a bidding.

141
00:09:55,356 --> 00:09:58,918
This would go to public bidding, anything over $100,000, actually over $50,000.

142
00:09:58,959 --> 00:09:59,619
Yeah, OK.

143
00:09:59,639 --> 00:09:59,759
Yeah.

144
00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:01,180
So this is just an estimate.

145
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,521
Yeah, perfect.

146
00:10:10,448 --> 00:10:12,330
Yeah, no, this is a great project, obviously.

147
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:18,654
I lived in Madrid a long time, never saw that found in action, and I'm definitely older than 35 years for sure.

148
00:10:20,496 --> 00:10:23,178
Is there a drawing or a photo that shows a little bit more detail?

149
00:10:23,198 --> 00:10:24,198
I didn't see it in the package.

150
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:32,044
I see a very detailed description of the PVC and all the pieces, but sometimes a photo is worth a thousand words.

151
00:10:32,084 --> 00:10:33,205
Is there something there you could share?

152
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:36,922
I have it in the back of your bag, yes.

153
00:10:36,942 --> 00:10:37,082
Oh, OK.

154
00:10:37,142 --> 00:10:37,482
Yeah.

155
00:10:37,522 --> 00:10:37,962
Maybe.

156
00:10:38,823 --> 00:10:39,743
I can email it.

157
00:10:39,903 --> 00:10:43,585
It actually was included in with the photo that I used.

158
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:43,685
OK.

159
00:10:43,745 --> 00:10:47,826
It was in with what Weston and Samson's did, like a schematic.

160
00:10:48,687 --> 00:10:49,147
OK.

161
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:50,407
But that's just the pump.

162
00:10:50,427 --> 00:10:53,809
Does it show the whole assembly with the photo?

163
00:10:55,189 --> 00:10:57,070
There's no renderings, right, or this, or anything like that?

164
00:10:59,891 --> 00:11:00,891
No renderings.

165
00:11:03,425 --> 00:11:10,792
This is... Oh, I mean, I'm... You're going to have to jot that down for me.

166
00:11:10,852 --> 00:11:13,214
What are you asking for rendering stuff?

167
00:11:13,395 --> 00:11:18,039
I see, like, even an eye-level photo of what's there.

168
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,883
But that's just the schematic, like, what it's going to look like.

169
00:11:22,864 --> 00:11:24,145
Well, you won't see anything.

170
00:11:24,205 --> 00:11:25,607
It's all going to be underground.

171
00:11:26,077 --> 00:11:30,821
So the inside of the fountain is inside the statue itself.

172
00:11:30,841 --> 00:11:38,228
So you won't, the average person is not going to visually see anything other than her working.

173
00:11:38,548 --> 00:11:40,570
They're going to have to dig underneath.

174
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:50,980
So there's a section of the cemetery kind of catty corner to behind the statue where there's nothing there yet.

175
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,341
And so they will have to dig a whole new drainage system behind her.

176
00:11:56,361 --> 00:12:02,622
And so you, at the end of the day, nobody should actually see anything.

177
00:12:02,642 --> 00:12:06,363
So are you saying like near the tree here is where?

178
00:12:06,383 --> 00:12:09,003
It should come, so these are all graves.

179
00:12:09,063 --> 00:12:09,243
Yes.

180
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:17,024
And that was what happens when they, when they were digging these graves, they cut off her drainage to this down here.

181
00:12:17,044 --> 00:12:20,345
So they're gonna have to come up this way to avoid all of those

182
00:12:20,695 --> 00:12:25,237
Because what happens is when you pump water through granges, things come up that shouldn't be coming up.

183
00:12:25,777 --> 00:12:26,077
Fair.

184
00:12:27,057 --> 00:12:30,559
And so that's literally, they're going to have to drain her out here.

185
00:12:30,859 --> 00:12:30,959
OK.

186
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:44,124
I'd like to ask, have you had an assessment of what repair is needed to the statue?

187
00:12:44,144 --> 00:12:47,745
That is what is in the proposal.

188
00:12:48,261 --> 00:12:52,204
if they know exactly what needs to be done, because they've looked at it before.

189
00:12:52,224 --> 00:12:52,264
OK.

190
00:12:52,284 --> 00:12:54,225
Thank you.

191
00:12:54,345 --> 00:12:55,526
Reg?

192
00:12:55,606 --> 00:13:00,789
One of the things that I read in your application was that they don't do removal.

193
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:10,636
So if they do have to get up underneath there and dig and so on and so forth, and there's excess gravel, dirt, whatever, rocks, what have you, they won't remove it.

194
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:16,260
I would respectfully think that we would probably

195
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:26,369
talk to whoever we get the bidding from, that stuff be removed, because it has to be cleaned up so that it looks like it does now.

196
00:13:26,469 --> 00:13:27,229
Absolutely.

197
00:13:27,309 --> 00:13:33,510
Rather than, you know, with a pile of... Well, the landscaping is included.

198
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:35,151
They would landscape over it.

199
00:13:35,191 --> 00:13:39,952
But yes, whoever ends up doing the work, of course, would have to remove any debris.

200
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,332
And they didn't put that in their proposal, though.

201
00:13:44,192 --> 00:13:45,773
Just let me know.

202
00:13:45,893 --> 00:13:46,113
Okay.

203
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:49,205
Thank you.

204
00:13:49,385 --> 00:13:51,266
Are there other questions from committee members?

205
00:13:51,286 --> 00:13:59,449
All right, well, thank you very much for your presentation.

206
00:13:59,469 --> 00:14:09,753
Thank you very much.

207
00:14:10,813 --> 00:14:14,995
And I would remind everyone that there are snacks

208
00:14:17,878 --> 00:14:23,322
and invite our next presentation, which is Shiloh Baptist Church.

209
00:14:27,704 --> 00:14:35,409
I do appreciate your coming to sit at the table because that way the folks online can see you just as well as we in the room can see you.

210
00:14:35,429 --> 00:14:39,011
Do you want to sit here, sir?

211
00:14:39,031 --> 00:14:41,792
I can stand for a while.

212
00:14:41,972 --> 00:14:43,613
Okay, up to you.

213
00:14:43,653 --> 00:14:44,274
That works too?

214
00:14:44,743 --> 00:14:45,623
Great to be back.

215
00:14:46,304 --> 00:14:56,047
We have had an opportunity to come before the committee on another effort, which is ongoing right now, which is the daycare center that's moving right along.

216
00:14:56,707 --> 00:15:00,548
And we appreciate all that you've done to make that work for us.

217
00:15:01,669 --> 00:15:11,312
Now, Shiloh started out on this mission before, repairing the windows on the east side and all around the entire church.

218
00:15:11,372 --> 00:15:14,313
So we have a preliminary survey that covers

219
00:15:14,894 --> 00:15:25,642
all that, and what today we want to emphasize is the eastern side of the church, which is this Palladium window that you see there.

220
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:43,175
The Palladium window is probably a beautiful architectural feature that people see as they pass by the church, and it's probably one of the things that is most in danger of having leaves falling.

221
00:15:43,195 --> 00:15:43,235
So

222
00:15:44,801 --> 00:15:53,583
We would like to make sure that the architect which we had on board before had surveyed this and resurveyed this item.

223
00:15:54,523 --> 00:16:13,787
And that actually would take some of that money and emphasize shoring or meeting the historical code to make sure the window stays in place as we gather more money to replace or to put the church plating window back into shape.

224
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:22,955
because there's millions of dollars in terms of all of, if we were to do all the windows, but that eastern side is what we want to emphasize.

225
00:16:24,236 --> 00:16:26,756
And it also enhances the community.

226
00:16:27,377 --> 00:16:42,481
The people who live around there, walk by the church, and see the church, see this church as a negative, if the windows are not pretty, as well as any

227
00:16:43,698 --> 00:16:57,769
Religious features of this church, we'll make sure to accommodate either we place them with other stained glass that have no religious emphasis, or we pay for that ourselves.

228
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:10,679
So we want to gather funds, additional funds beyond what we think that that will work, plus what you're contributing if you so find that we will be granted them.

229
00:17:11,538 --> 00:17:13,660
$150,000 to do this work.

230
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:22,546
So that's the emphasis of this today, is to emphasize the Palladium window and the windows that are adjacent to that.

231
00:17:22,566 --> 00:17:27,409
I don't know if you have one.

232
00:17:27,509 --> 00:17:29,510
If this picture right here, probably down here.

233
00:17:29,931 --> 00:17:30,351
See these?

234
00:17:30,771 --> 00:17:32,152
There's two adjacent windows.

235
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:36,475
But the main window is this feature, this architectural feature.

236
00:17:37,095 --> 00:17:40,798
On the more northerly side, that is in good order.

237
00:17:41,756 --> 00:17:45,577
compared to what it is to the other church windows.

238
00:17:45,877 --> 00:17:52,958
And on the other side, it's very—I haven't had some of that work done on it before, on the second floor.

239
00:17:52,978 --> 00:18:10,182
So we just want to put the church into a more environmentally positive feature, so that we don't have heat loss, as well as we keep the architectural feature of that church in good order for the local community to enjoy.

240
00:18:10,966 --> 00:18:15,267
Because the church does serve many other things besides a religious order.

241
00:18:15,287 --> 00:18:16,407
It's a gathering space.

242
00:18:17,207 --> 00:18:22,529
We're probably entertaining some other community efforts there.

243
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:25,309
So that's my position right now.

244
00:18:26,509 --> 00:18:27,790
Thank you very much.

245
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:33,771
Questions from the committee members?

246
00:18:37,974 --> 00:18:42,357
I would just like to comment that, oh, yes, Jeremy.

247
00:18:44,978 --> 00:18:45,759
Thank you.

248
00:18:46,099 --> 00:18:47,180
Thanks for the presentation.

249
00:18:47,640 --> 00:19:02,749
I'm just curious, I'm looking at the information provided, maybe this is a question for Teresa as well, but is there a quote from a contractor or any other documentation of the cost that's requested here?

250
00:19:02,849 --> 00:19:05,051
I'm sorry if I missed that when you were speaking.

251
00:19:07,122 --> 00:19:10,284
Yes, there should be in the meeting packet.

252
00:19:10,464 --> 00:19:12,025
We've got an estimate.

253
00:19:12,165 --> 00:19:13,125
It was from 2022.

254
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:22,330
So to Mr. McIntyre's point, it needs to get kind of revisited for pricing, but we do have a sense of what the cost would be here.

255
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:26,652
Maybe there's a technical glitch on my end, Teresa.

256
00:19:26,672 --> 00:19:28,373
I only see the application.

257
00:19:28,393 --> 00:19:29,893
Okay.

258
00:19:31,774 --> 00:19:34,435
I'd be curious to read through that.

259
00:19:35,853 --> 00:19:37,574
Yes.

260
00:19:38,214 --> 00:19:52,558
I know that when they prepared their very first application for us, I helped them gather, I think, a second, which would also be a couple of years old.

261
00:19:53,379 --> 00:20:02,822
But the architect's information might also help to provide an estimate of cost.

262
00:20:06,192 --> 00:20:10,513
Yeah, this was, I think, the one that they had gathered before I started working with them.

263
00:20:11,313 --> 00:20:14,354
So there might be another one in the first application.

264
00:20:14,394 --> 00:20:19,356
We could look through that material and see if there are some comparables.

265
00:20:20,816 --> 00:20:31,139
Is there a spreadsheet that shows the estimated current estimate costs, escalations from the last three years, and then contingency?

266
00:20:31,199 --> 00:20:32,499
I missed that too, if that's in there.

267
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:34,780
I think one thing

268
00:20:35,857 --> 00:20:45,103
that we want to, okay so this itemizes by window because the church has 40 stained glass windows in it.

269
00:20:45,123 --> 00:21:01,215
It's really incredible and they're all beautiful and most of them have geometric designs that are not religious so they are, it would be possible to be able to put

270
00:21:02,683 --> 00:21:05,904
um, public funding into preserving them.

271
00:21:07,985 --> 00:21:20,650
But that's, that would be the, what it would cost to restore all of those windows is more, you know, it would require several phases of funding because that's a very big project.

272
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:27,753
So I appreciate that their architect asked them to, um, prioritize

273
00:21:28,863 --> 00:21:34,904
That one, the palladium window and the ones on the east side of the sanctuary space.

274
00:21:35,164 --> 00:21:41,866
So that those are the windows that are the highest priority to address in phase 1.

275
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:45,546
So, D1, C1 and D2.

276
00:21:45,606 --> 00:21:45,927
Yep.

277
00:22:05,268 --> 00:22:09,850
The rough cost for the C1, which was the palladium window, 56.

278
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:14,591
And then the side light pieces are 48.

279
00:22:14,731 --> 00:22:20,553
And again, this is 2022.

280
00:22:20,613 --> 00:22:28,436
There is another price estimate to look at, but just to kind of get some sense of what pricing was three plus years ago.

281
00:22:32,197 --> 00:22:37,699
So that would really have a tremendous improvement to the community's spirit.

282
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:45,242
The congregation certainly would be benefiting, as well as its loss of heat would be much less.

283
00:22:45,462 --> 00:22:45,742
Yeah.

284
00:22:45,923 --> 00:22:56,387
So the number of things that follow environmentally as well as enhances the community who have put a significant amount of money in their own properties.

285
00:22:56,987 --> 00:22:59,208
So they'd like to follow.

286
00:22:59,248 --> 00:23:00,688
We have some great neighbors there.

287
00:23:02,888 --> 00:23:12,934
I would heartily encourage you to ask your neighbors to contribute to the fund for the windows.

288
00:23:13,574 --> 00:23:20,178
We had a QR that we started for separate funding and held that funding in place.

289
00:23:20,658 --> 00:23:26,642
We really haven't placed a lot of emphasis on that because we were doing with the other project that was working there.

290
00:23:27,162 --> 00:23:30,624
But that's coming along and it should be out of our here.

291
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:32,778
by January 26.

292
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:47,082
So that the church and its membership could make a strong emphasis, the trustee board would be particularly interested in making a main focus to raise more funds to supplement whatever we achieved here.

293
00:23:48,362 --> 00:23:53,643
I would love to see that because the only religious panels in the whole building

294
00:23:54,396 --> 00:23:58,139
are little tiny pieces within that Palladian window.

295
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:05,505
So it would be really helpful to see the private match to this project specifically.

296
00:24:05,525 --> 00:24:21,237
Right, because currently we have something like three or four thousand dollars actually set aside for people who have walked by and contributed to the church, and the QR.

297
00:24:21,257 --> 00:24:23,159
And that was just basically

298
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,980
not a very strong effort.

299
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:29,482
Look, this is an incredibly important church architecturally.

300
00:24:29,502 --> 00:24:30,622
I'm on the historic commission.

301
00:24:30,642 --> 00:24:33,143
I know that we think this is a significant building.

302
00:24:33,183 --> 00:24:35,704
You mentioned something comparable to that in the application.

303
00:24:35,784 --> 00:24:38,404
So this is all heading in the right direction.

304
00:24:38,444 --> 00:24:50,228
The only question I have about this is that many, many times, if not most times, when I hear about historic buildings getting window restoration, usually there's

305
00:24:51,078 --> 00:24:56,439
an attempt to not just, because all there is, is this window.

306
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,900
There's no outside window or inside window.

307
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:10,602
There's this one plane of stained glass and lead between a zero degree day on the outside in the winter and a 68 degree heated interior for this project.

308
00:25:11,222 --> 00:25:13,883
Are we not, as part of this restoration, we're not putting anything

309
00:25:14,924 --> 00:25:22,481
on the to make the building more weather tight to make it, I guess,

310
00:25:23,529 --> 00:25:24,690
hopefully preserve it for longer.

311
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:32,115
We've seen that on other window restoration projects, Roberta and Teresa, I think in Chevalier and maybe a couple of other ones.

312
00:25:33,556 --> 00:25:41,362
I know we did it in the Brooks Estate, but they were much smaller windows because we have interior storm windows there, which is often to maintain the exterior look.

313
00:25:41,422 --> 00:25:47,886
So is there anything under consideration for that aspect of this or is that simply not part of this project?

314
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:59,484
inviting that we look at that much more farther, because we do have an architect on board who's actually very familiar with this church.

315
00:26:00,264 --> 00:26:01,645
So that would be helpful.

316
00:26:01,745 --> 00:26:10,311
He could certainly point out other alternatives, whether it's a storm window or some type that would be good inside.

317
00:26:10,831 --> 00:26:17,676
I've seen this operation where they put them on the outside and it causes more problems for condensation.

318
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:26,679
But if it's in the interior and it's much better for heat loss, that's a number one thing for today.

319
00:26:26,699 --> 00:26:28,423
We want to get the heat loss done.

320
00:26:29,058 --> 00:26:35,482
Yeah, I think without something on the inside, I think the heat loss will still be pretty significant, even with the important restoration work that's being done.

321
00:26:36,222 --> 00:26:49,190
I guess I'm encouraging you to think about that to see if there's maybe a little bit more investigation that can be done to see if these windows, again, the scale of these windows are very challenging, especially the arch ones.

322
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:53,212
I mean, they must be, what, 12, 13 feet wide?

323
00:26:53,252 --> 00:26:54,513
I mean, they're pretty damn big.

324
00:26:54,893 --> 00:26:57,295
The smaller ones, I think, are simpler to tackle.

325
00:26:58,557 --> 00:27:08,265
Plus the round shape obviously has its own challenges, but I think it's worth just taking another look and seeing if there's more that can be done.

326
00:27:08,625 --> 00:27:16,491
It would cost more, because I don't think that's what your cost estimate is part, is assuming that there's anything on the inside of these windows, right?

327
00:27:17,792 --> 00:27:24,997
No, at the present time, I concur with what you're thinking, and so that's invited.

328
00:27:26,574 --> 00:27:29,256
and we would talk with the architect about that feature.

329
00:27:30,197 --> 00:27:31,038
That would be great.

330
00:27:31,298 --> 00:27:54,877
And if you could confirm with Teresa, after you talk with the architect, to ask if the architect has a more current estimate of the cost of restoration for those windows on that section, and to what the architect recommends for weather protection.

331
00:27:55,817 --> 00:28:15,392
And so if we have an updated budget before we meet in December, we want to make sure that we're recommending an amount of funding that's sufficient for you to complete the work if the funding is recommended.

332
00:28:16,033 --> 00:28:19,055
So if you're able to make sure that you have

333
00:28:19,623 --> 00:28:26,526
the scope that you need and the cost estimate that you need for that scope.

334
00:28:27,266 --> 00:28:33,128
We will use your new budget to consider the recommendation.

335
00:28:33,168 --> 00:28:33,789
Thank you.

336
00:28:33,809 --> 00:28:35,069
Thank you so much.

337
00:28:35,309 --> 00:28:36,990
Thank you.

338
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:38,391
I'll give you a call tomorrow.

339
00:28:38,431 --> 00:28:38,951
Maisha?

340
00:28:50,217 --> 00:28:51,657
Yeah, I just wanted to add one thing.

341
00:28:51,717 --> 00:28:57,379
I'm curious, I don't know if anyone knows, but MassSafe has the rebate program for residential buildings.

342
00:28:57,899 --> 00:29:02,680
And I wonder if the church might be able to utilize something from that for commercial buildings as well.

343
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,401
Yeah, of course.

344
00:29:04,901 --> 00:29:08,102
Well, sorry, but I'm sorry, I didn't understand.

345
00:29:08,202 --> 00:29:09,862
That's all right.

346
00:29:09,962 --> 00:29:11,303
But what was the question?

347
00:29:11,703 --> 00:29:12,043
Sorry.

348
00:29:12,123 --> 00:29:16,264
I can repeat what I said.

349
00:29:19,823 --> 00:29:24,906
Mass Save has residential rebates for window installation and window replacement.

350
00:29:25,427 --> 00:29:30,830
I think that they have similar programs for larger buildings that are commercial and non-profit.

351
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:36,833
That might be something to look into as well that can help incentivize or rebate any upgrades to the church.

352
00:29:37,854 --> 00:29:39,315
We'll follow up on that.

353
00:29:39,755 --> 00:29:40,015
Yeah.

354
00:29:40,035 --> 00:29:46,959
Maybe the architect would also know how to find out about Mass Save rebates.

355
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:47,620
Yes.

356
00:29:48,935 --> 00:29:50,916
Appreciate it.

357
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:52,196
Thank you both.

358
00:29:52,356 --> 00:29:53,116
All right.

359
00:29:53,556 --> 00:29:54,177
Get home safe.

360
00:29:54,237 --> 00:29:54,637
Thank you.

361
00:29:54,697 --> 00:29:57,698
All right.

362
00:29:58,578 --> 00:30:07,661
And next on our projects this evening is Riverside Plaza Shade Improvements Additional Trunch.

363
00:30:10,222 --> 00:30:16,704
We are joined by City Planner Amanda Centro from the Office of Planning Development Sustainability.

364
00:30:16,864 --> 00:30:17,204
Amanda.

365
00:30:18,198 --> 00:30:18,718
You have the floor.

366
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:19,839
Thank you.

367
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:20,879
Hi, everyone.

368
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:25,862
So I'm Amanda.

369
00:30:25,922 --> 00:30:26,943
I'll start with a question.

370
00:30:27,063 --> 00:30:34,126
Who here is familiar with the Riverside Shade Improvement Project that was before the CPC last year?

371
00:30:34,146 --> 00:30:35,487
If you could raise your hands.

372
00:30:38,148 --> 00:30:40,329
OK, so a chunk of you and maybe a few not.

373
00:30:40,369 --> 00:30:41,850
So I'll go over a couple of things.

374
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:44,692
But is it OK if I share my screen?

375
00:30:45,392 --> 00:30:47,053
Yes, I believe I just made you a co-host.

376
00:30:47,609 --> 00:30:48,351
Amazing.

377
00:30:48,452 --> 00:30:50,918
All right, let's take a look here.

378
00:30:56,083 --> 00:30:58,664
Okay, are we seeing my screen hopefully?

379
00:30:59,345 --> 00:30:59,905
We are.

380
00:31:00,345 --> 00:31:01,546
Great.

381
00:31:03,047 --> 00:31:15,153
So the Riverside Plaza Improvement Project was before the CPC last year, and we were awarded funding as well as a PARC, P-A-R-C, state grant.

382
00:31:16,573 --> 00:31:18,294
So just to orient us a little bit,

383
00:31:19,995 --> 00:31:20,895
This is the plaza.

384
00:31:20,955 --> 00:31:22,516
It's in the heart of Medford Square.

385
00:31:23,196 --> 00:31:39,702
It was renovated in, I think, 2018, and it's a great, well-loved, used space, except that there isn't a lot of existing shade within the actual plaza area, or patio area, is what I've been calling it, during the

386
00:31:40,422 --> 00:31:41,622
hottest parts of the year.

387
00:31:41,843 --> 00:31:49,325
And so it becomes somewhat unusable during peak season in the summer, which is too hot.

388
00:31:49,525 --> 00:32:03,771
And so the way that folks tend to use this space, if they're using it on hot days, is to drag some of the mobile chairs and tables under the adjacent lawn area where there's some existing mature trees, which works.

389
00:32:04,111 --> 00:32:08,072
But there are some barriers to doing that.

390
00:32:08,132 --> 00:32:09,373
It's not an accessible.

391
00:32:10,493 --> 00:32:15,800
area that's just, you know, at this point used to be lawn, but is now dirt patching tree roots.

392
00:32:17,041 --> 00:32:24,390
And so we thought that we could do some targeted improvements to this area to make it more usable and more climate resilient.

393
00:32:25,697 --> 00:32:48,135
So what you all saw last year when we applied is we had these sort of sets of shade sails over here, a deck from the accessible route here with a ramp, and some light bollards that were an ad alternate, so an option if we had the budget for bidding.

394
00:32:48,615 --> 00:32:54,620
And it's not actually showed on this picture, but we included in the scope a water bottle filling station.

395
00:32:55,500 --> 00:33:02,789
Um, and we went out to bid with this in the spring and unfortunately the bids came back much higher than anticipated.

396
00:33:03,209 --> 00:33:05,351
So we had budgeted this around $300,000 and the lowest bid was $600,000.

397
00:33:05,452 --> 00:33:05,612
Uh, so.

398
00:33:11,459 --> 00:33:30,076
We regrouped a bit, met with the bidders to understand what was driving those costs, and also met with our other grant funder, the park grant administrator, to understand what their parameters were for maintaining that funding if we were going to make any adjustments.

399
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:39,830
I'm approaching you all today with a revised design scope as well as a request for some contingency funding.

400
00:33:40,871 --> 00:33:54,724
The scope still includes shade sails, it adds metal shade umbrellas, a smaller deck footprint but still accessible, a tree relocation, and we maintain that water fountain Bottle Filler station.

401
00:33:56,927 --> 00:33:59,828
So here is the revised design scope.

402
00:34:00,968 --> 00:34:04,229
You can see here there's existing seating in these two areas.

403
00:34:04,429 --> 00:34:11,232
And one of the parameters given by the park grant was that we shade the same areas that we had originally proposed.

404
00:34:11,872 --> 00:34:15,913
So we're proposing now to have two shade sails.

405
00:34:16,313 --> 00:34:21,755
I've got some pictures to show you that go into the landscaped area over here.

406
00:34:22,475 --> 00:34:35,755
we relocate an existing tree from here into this southern portion of the patio, which actually kind of better situates it for more optimally shading the patio.

407
00:34:35,775 --> 00:34:37,577
This is in the south part of it.

408
00:34:38,238 --> 00:34:57,714
And then we have two commercial outdoor surface mounted shade umbrellas to further provide shade to the seating, and a shortened deck footprint, as well as the water bottle filling station over here.

409
00:34:58,455 --> 00:34:59,796
So that part hasn't changed.

410
00:35:01,737 --> 00:35:06,741
So I can give you a little bit of context as to why we chose to make these adjustments.

411
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:20,403
One of the things that we learned from Bitters is that in the original design, we had a number of posts for the shade sails that were going into the patio area, like where the pavement was.

412
00:35:20,923 --> 00:35:31,065
And we also needed to relocate two existing light posts that were in that patio area to different spots so that they could fit the whole shade system.

413
00:35:32,385 --> 00:35:34,767
And each of these posts also have footings.

414
00:35:35,128 --> 00:35:39,031
So it's actually a significant amount of disruption to the paving here.

415
00:35:39,692 --> 00:35:52,504
And so bidders were making very conservative estimates as to the amount of pavement that they'd have to replace, the risk of damage to the papers in that area.

416
00:35:52,664 --> 00:35:57,329
So whatever we could do to minimize disruption to the actual patio.

417
00:35:57,977 --> 00:36:00,440
it would help us recuperate some costs.

418
00:36:02,101 --> 00:36:17,457
The tree over here, I'll add that while it also benefits us by allowing us to put a shade sail here, but we realize that there's this large piece of ledge just under the surface in this area.

419
00:36:19,002 --> 00:36:31,993
For the long term health of the tree, it's probably not the best spot to locate it anyway, because it's sort of surrounded and bounded on all sides by pavement or by hard structure.

420
00:36:32,393 --> 00:36:37,558
So we think that it may thrive better over here anyway, while also providing more optimal shade.

421
00:36:40,336 --> 00:36:47,800
I'll add one last thing about the design, which is that it will be out to bid as of tomorrow morning.

422
00:36:49,301 --> 00:36:59,507
So this is all in the base bid, and as a bid alternate, we wanted to have the opportunity to maybe pay for the larger deck footprint.

423
00:37:00,067 --> 00:37:11,636
So it will just depend on what we see as far as bidding interest and budget, but that option is still maintained by the bid alternate.

424
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,502
just a couple reference photos.

425
00:37:15,782 --> 00:37:16,823
I'll collapse this.

426
00:37:16,843 --> 00:37:19,867
I don't know if you guys see my little double screen here.

427
00:37:21,408 --> 00:37:33,461
So this is the composite decking and little kick rail, which was a recommendation from our disability specialist, Nicholas Karenge in the city.

428
00:37:35,215 --> 00:37:47,323
So just as an example of what this might look like, as well as the water bottle filling station, which we have iterations of this in Car Park and McGlynn.

429
00:37:47,844 --> 00:37:49,365
It's a product we're familiar with.

430
00:37:51,346 --> 00:37:52,147
Oops, sorry.

431
00:37:53,327 --> 00:38:03,314
And then an example of the metal surface mounted commercial umbrellas and the swoopy shade sail.

432
00:38:05,141 --> 00:38:08,823
And there's a drawing here to give you a sense of scale.

433
00:38:09,324 --> 00:38:12,326
So it arcs over the plaza, and there would be two of these.

434
00:38:15,468 --> 00:38:17,169
And just a little refresher on funding.

435
00:38:17,449 --> 00:38:19,951
So we received a park grant for just shy of $200,000.

436
00:38:20,051 --> 00:38:22,132
We received CPA funding last year for $144,000.

437
00:38:22,172 --> 00:38:24,154
And this ask here, oh, gosh, I'm sorry.

438
00:38:32,279 --> 00:38:37,180
of $125,000 is, I will full disclosure, a little bit hand wavy.

439
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:47,842
I wanted to preserve the opportunity to come before you guys to present this and request additional funding.

440
00:38:48,783 --> 00:38:58,025
It is my hope that when we close the bids on November 5, maybe we will not need to apply for funding and we can rescind this application.

441
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:06,200
But and so I will have that information to you all before your November 18th meeting.

442
00:39:07,641 --> 00:39:17,428
But I suppose just in the interest of keeping the door open and the conversation going, I thought it important to come before you guys.

443
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:29,477
And that is in part because this project does have a completion deadline because of the park grant.

444
00:39:30,019 --> 00:39:33,363
It must be done by June 1 of next year.

445
00:39:33,383 --> 00:39:38,448
I think this is actually a really good time of year for us to be bidding this project.

446
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:44,255
It's right before the holidays start to kick in and as contractors are trying to schedule the next

447
00:39:44,915 --> 00:39:50,579
um, season and the duration of the work shouldn't be very long, a month or two.

448
00:39:51,339 --> 00:39:58,424
Um, so that, you know, if they start in the spring, uh, that should be sufficient time to finish by June.

449
00:39:59,245 --> 00:40:08,291
Um, but, uh, some of that, or that is definitely dependent on whether we get, um, a successful bid this time around.

450
00:40:08,945 --> 00:40:21,729
And so having the flexibility and ability to be nimble and just sort of keeping a couple of different irons in the fire to allow us to do that is part of why I'm before you guys today.

451
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:25,750
So I'll pause there.

452
00:40:26,571 --> 00:40:29,792
Just a couple of procedural points.

453
00:40:30,512 --> 00:40:33,433
First, thank you for showing the timeline.

454
00:40:33,882 --> 00:40:57,458
do you need to request expedited decision so that you're able to have a funding commitment in hand when you, I mean, we won't be able to have a decision by November 5th, but we could have a decision by the end of November.

455
00:40:57,798 --> 00:40:59,179
Would that be,

456
00:41:01,645 --> 00:41:03,871
do you need to have an expedited decision?

457
00:41:05,036 --> 00:41:06,396
Yes, thank you for asking that.

458
00:41:07,077 --> 00:41:15,259
So an expedited decision, should we need or should we continue with our application before the CPC, would be very helpful.

459
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:29,184
It's part of why I had asked Teresa if I could come before you guys in this October session, even though the bid hasn't opened and won't be closed yet, just so that you all can be familiar with the project and kind of mulling it over.

460
00:41:29,764 --> 00:41:32,245
And I think that, you know,

461
00:41:33,285 --> 00:41:41,990
If we need to, end of November into December would be viable.

462
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:54,896
But I think certainly before the end of this year would be very helpful for securing that contract should we be proceeding with this application.

463
00:41:54,916 --> 00:41:58,278
Thank you.

464
00:42:00,605 --> 00:42:04,026
The timing is awkward, but I think it might be manageable for us.

465
00:42:05,766 --> 00:42:07,487
Jeremy, I'll recognize you in one moment.

466
00:42:07,507 --> 00:42:29,812
The other comment that I wanted to make was that even if you don't need the funding, I think we need to keep this application in the stream to approve a change in scope, since this iteration of the project is significantly different from what you have presented.

467
00:42:31,088 --> 00:42:34,390
when you originally awarded the funds last year?

468
00:42:36,391 --> 00:42:37,352
Understood, yes.

469
00:42:39,513 --> 00:42:39,973
Jeremy?

470
00:42:42,554 --> 00:42:44,956
Thank you, and thanks for that great presentation, Amanda.

471
00:42:46,536 --> 00:42:56,962
I'm curious to know, have any, in this kind of VE process, have any other alternatives been explored that didn't rely on a structured

472
00:42:59,385 --> 00:43:04,791
integral shade element, or was there?

473
00:43:07,231 --> 00:43:08,212
Yeah, yeah.

474
00:43:09,053 --> 00:43:21,283
So I had to meet with the administrator for the park grant, which is the other funding that we received for this project, to understand what parameters they had for maintaining their funding.

475
00:43:21,743 --> 00:43:30,110
And one of the parameters was that we shade the same amount of area that we had originally proposed in our first design.

476
00:43:30,551 --> 00:43:32,732
And they did have a strong preference for having

477
00:43:34,325 --> 00:43:37,889
shade sails as some element of the design.

478
00:43:40,058 --> 00:43:44,562
just as a durable and, I guess, aesthetic option.

479
00:43:45,683 --> 00:43:59,956
So we looked at and kind of vetted with them and included also Teresa as part of these conversations to understand what other types of shade we could do, whether it's more robust tree plantings.

480
00:44:01,397 --> 00:44:03,459
We looked at different types of umbrellas.

481
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:18,622
Landed on these options, um, for, for those, uh, to, uh, existing seating areas kind of after throwing around a couple of ideas and considering budget, um,

482
00:44:19,385 --> 00:44:38,671
I may have mentioned this already, but another piece of avoiding disruption to the patio area, we were a little bit limited to trying to use the landscape areas for sighting posts and things like that.

483
00:44:41,171 --> 00:44:43,292
So did that answer your question?

484
00:44:44,347 --> 00:44:44,927
It does, yes.

485
00:44:45,067 --> 00:44:45,467
Thank you.

486
00:44:46,087 --> 00:45:04,411
Just so I understand, I see in looking at street view, it looks like on the south side of the plaza, there are some existing integral benches or tables that are built into the pavement.

487
00:45:04,491 --> 00:45:08,552
Are those replaced by the umbrella picnic tables?

488
00:45:09,212 --> 00:45:11,253
I may have misunderstood that.

489
00:45:11,815 --> 00:45:13,436
Oh, no, that's a fair question.

490
00:45:13,556 --> 00:45:22,778
So the picture that I showed you of those disc umbrellas was a little misleading, because it showed attached to it a table and chair set.

491
00:45:23,139 --> 00:45:34,922
But actually, they can come separate from those table and chairs, which I think is our preference, because we have existing seating there, and we can anchor it to the ground in this case.

492
00:45:35,783 --> 00:45:35,923
Good.

493
00:45:36,043 --> 00:45:37,023
Thank you for clarifying.

494
00:45:43,592 --> 00:45:43,892
Doug?

495
00:45:45,393 --> 00:45:46,754
I mean, this looks great.

496
00:45:46,854 --> 00:45:52,018
Obviously, I voted for the last version, which would have been nice, but this is actually still pretty good.

497
00:45:52,058 --> 00:45:55,200
And I think the sales are nice, dramatic flair.

498
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:59,203
I think it will punch up that space, make it a little bit of a feature.

499
00:45:59,223 --> 00:46:00,444
So I think it's a good decision.

500
00:46:00,504 --> 00:46:05,487
It's a good balance between design and the functionality that you're looking for.

501
00:46:05,507 --> 00:46:06,428
So I think that's all good.

502
00:46:08,649 --> 00:46:08,910
I think

503
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:17,792
There's a way with the contract and the sequence that Roberto was describing to, you know, no one's going to start building until March or April anyway, right?

504
00:46:17,812 --> 00:46:19,373
You actually have plenty of time.

505
00:46:19,953 --> 00:46:21,413
You need to line people up obviously.

506
00:46:21,433 --> 00:46:35,297
But I was hoping there was a way with the folks in City Hall where you could, you know, if you need money from us, whatever, whether it's the full 125 or some fraction thereof, that we could still figure it out.

507
00:46:35,317 --> 00:46:37,338
Because as you probably know, we have

508
00:46:38,498 --> 00:46:41,779
I don't know, we have a lot more requests than we do dollars.

509
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:48,462
To me, this is a big priority because I think anyone who goes to Memphis Square could benefit from this.

510
00:46:48,622 --> 00:46:53,604
There's a lot of people who could benefit, so I see this as a really good priority.

511
00:46:54,724 --> 00:46:58,645
But I'm hoping we can not rush it if we don't need to.

512
00:46:58,825 --> 00:47:05,428
Just by the way, how we award, what the time award is, and knowing that they're not going to build for at least five months from now.

513
00:47:07,356 --> 00:47:08,577
That's so valid, yes.

514
00:47:08,897 --> 00:47:17,844
I think what I'll do after this is meet with our procurement staff just to understand how we could structure that and build in a bit more flexibility.

515
00:47:18,665 --> 00:47:30,774
And you're right, that building certainly won't, unless, I don't know, it would be a rare thing, I think, for a contractor to get an award and build this fall for this project.

516
00:47:30,854 --> 00:47:33,416
So yeah, I think that we can

517
00:47:36,485 --> 00:47:37,605
we can make something work.

518
00:47:38,165 --> 00:47:41,246
Yeah, it's a procurement language thing more than anything else, I think.

519
00:47:43,186 --> 00:47:43,546
Thank you.

520
00:47:49,827 --> 00:47:51,007
Thoughts, questions?

521
00:47:53,768 --> 00:48:05,430
I had a thought that came to me, which was I heard words this evening like aesthetic and dramatic referring to the shade sales.

522
00:48:06,107 --> 00:48:32,938
I wonder if we could lean into that by maybe working with the Arts Commission and inviting the arts community to personalize the sales and kind of be able to use that as an opportunity to bring in our public art element into Medford Square.

523
00:48:35,474 --> 00:48:36,294
That's really fun.

524
00:48:36,374 --> 00:48:48,101
So maybe customizing the sails that are the canvas sails or whatever material they are on the shade structures, having that be kind of a public conversation.

525
00:48:48,121 --> 00:48:51,162
Yeah, just a thought.

526
00:48:51,723 --> 00:48:52,003
Yeah.

527
00:48:54,224 --> 00:48:56,305
Yeah, that's a great idea.

528
00:48:57,766 --> 00:49:00,948
Let me think a bit on that and talk with our designer.

529
00:49:02,447 --> 00:49:10,050
But I feel like we could have a cool community conversation this fall and winter about what design and colors should be on there.

530
00:49:12,311 --> 00:49:20,915
Since we're opining, I'll just say that I think that I'd love to see more trees planted here to create shade as a priority.

531
00:49:21,595 --> 00:49:26,097
And I do think that these sales can be dramatic and certainly effective, but they have a lifespan.

532
00:49:26,478 --> 00:49:29,099
And in 10 years, we'll be either

533
00:49:30,145 --> 00:49:34,928
replacing them or wishing they weren't there potentially.

534
00:49:34,948 --> 00:49:36,909
We've had it happen in other projects.

535
00:49:36,989 --> 00:49:40,491
And so a tree will be there for a hundred years.

536
00:49:40,931 --> 00:49:52,998
And that's how, I know you've got a design and that's what we're focused on, but I think that there are other things that could be done.

537
00:49:54,124 --> 00:49:55,245
more cost effectively.

538
00:49:56,786 --> 00:49:58,547
Thanks.

539
00:49:58,587 --> 00:50:00,489
That's a valid point, Jeremy.

540
00:50:00,649 --> 00:50:05,853
And we've heard sort of different opinions about more trees in that area.

541
00:50:05,993 --> 00:50:13,138
I think possibly an advantage of this design is that we're making use of existing tree canopy.

542
00:50:14,005 --> 00:50:29,083
In the adjacent lawn area that is already used by folks and so creating accessible path there and then the southern area of the patio will be shaded primarily by trees, and they'll have the umbrellas there as well.

543
00:50:29,383 --> 00:50:31,886
And that can be removed if they become, you know.

544
00:50:33,622 --> 00:50:45,011
duplicative, and the shade sails are kind of an interim solution because those trees that are planted in the southern area will take time to mature.

545
00:50:45,311 --> 00:50:51,476
That probably doesn't address all of your feedback, but yeah, I figured I'd offer.

546
00:50:51,856 --> 00:50:52,617
Yeah, I appreciate that.

547
00:50:52,677 --> 00:50:58,962
And the deck under the trees is commendable and a feature that I like very much, a great way to use that space and protect those trees.

548
00:50:59,022 --> 00:50:59,922
So thank you for that.

549
00:51:00,443 --> 00:51:03,165
And keeping that as part of the project, I think, is really important.

550
00:51:04,615 --> 00:51:06,216
Is that composite decking under the trees?

551
00:51:06,356 --> 00:51:07,416
Is that what your image showed?

552
00:51:07,976 --> 00:51:08,236
Yes.

553
00:51:08,976 --> 00:51:09,417
OK, good.

554
00:51:09,657 --> 00:51:10,117
It looks good.

555
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:12,778
That's a good design.

556
00:51:13,238 --> 00:51:31,184
I do wonder about future patio projects like this that the city undertakes, whether there's opportunities to just preserve trees that are already there or do plantings amidst the patio, kind of thinking about the McGlynn playground and how a lot of old trees are preserved in there.

557
00:51:31,844 --> 00:51:32,224
But anyway.

558
00:51:33,286 --> 00:51:35,587
could address some of these issues in a future project.

559
00:51:43,949 --> 00:51:44,490
Thank you.

560
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:45,990
Thank you, everyone.

561
00:51:46,050 --> 00:51:52,092
And I think that covers the Riverside Plaza Shade Improvement Project.

562
00:51:52,112 --> 00:51:52,932
Thank you, Amanda.

563
00:51:53,573 --> 00:51:54,533
Thanks, Amanda.

564
00:51:54,693 --> 00:51:55,213
Thanks, Amanda.

565
00:51:59,883 --> 00:52:06,329
Next up is the Blaystead Park digital scoreboard.

566
00:52:06,349 --> 00:52:19,340
And while we transition, I just wanted to point out again, a few of you just came in the room, there's some snacks and water on top of the file cabinet that's for us.

567
00:52:22,328 --> 00:52:22,588
Yeah.

568
00:52:22,968 --> 00:52:23,408
Coach.

569
00:52:23,749 --> 00:52:25,029
Coach Oz, step on up.

570
00:52:25,289 --> 00:52:26,410
Sure.

571
00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:27,650
So this is a camera.

572
00:52:27,850 --> 00:52:28,211
Okay.

573
00:52:28,571 --> 00:52:35,594
Um, you can just talk and look like that's, I mean, the folks online only ever see this side of my face.

574
00:52:36,674 --> 00:52:40,716
So feel free to see, Stan, however you're comfortable.

575
00:52:40,736 --> 00:52:41,416
Yeah, absolutely.

576
00:52:41,436 --> 00:52:41,877
I see that.

577
00:52:41,897 --> 00:52:47,499
So, um, thank you again for inviting me and giving me the opportunity.

578
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:49,340
My name's Orazio Azzarello.

579
00:52:49,937 --> 00:52:54,239
I am the head baseball coach in Medford High School since 2021.

580
00:52:54,679 --> 00:53:03,222
I've been in the program since 2012 as an assistant coach and also a graduate of Medford High School, showing my age in 1995.

581
00:53:03,342 --> 00:53:14,807
So I grew up in Medford, and the reason for me to be here tonight is to have a digital school board at Placid Park, Bombo Catch Field.

582
00:53:16,618 --> 00:53:18,618
great location for a baseball field.

583
00:53:18,658 --> 00:53:21,679
That is our high school diamond that's shared by the city.

584
00:53:22,339 --> 00:53:26,840
And we're looking to see if we can add some value to the field.

585
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:30,560
If you've been down there, it's a beautiful area.

586
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:33,521
And it's just, it's missing some parts.

587
00:53:33,561 --> 00:53:43,063
And I think a sport board at the field would be something that the city would enjoy, the fans, the families, the parents, the community.

588
00:53:43,643 --> 00:53:44,683
There's a lot of history.

589
00:53:45,298 --> 00:53:48,040
in Medford, especially with Medford baseball.

590
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:53,743
Next month, we are inducting the 1983 baseball team who went undefeated.

591
00:53:53,763 --> 00:53:58,466
Last team that ever went undefeated in a regular season, they went 20-0.

592
00:53:58,486 --> 00:54:03,529
So it's funny because those people still ask about the field and what's being done.

593
00:54:03,589 --> 00:54:07,931
And I think this is a great opportunity for the community to come together.

594
00:54:07,951 --> 00:54:12,894
Also, you will see revenue being generated here.

595
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:18,493
because the field will now be rented probably a bit more once people see a scoreboard.

596
00:54:19,454 --> 00:54:22,156
I'm part of a lot of amateur baseball leagues during the summer.

597
00:54:22,756 --> 00:54:37,005
And with other cities and towns, you see that they rent out their field almost every single day or night because of lights or a scoreboard, which is, I think, great for the city because that money is now coming in and you're generating some revenue.

598
00:54:37,566 --> 00:54:40,668
But we have spoken to a couple of vendors

599
00:54:41,738 --> 00:54:47,542
We met with them down at the park to get some ideas on where we could put that scoreboard.

600
00:54:48,522 --> 00:54:52,985
The ask is for $110,000 for the scoreboard.

601
00:54:53,745 --> 00:54:56,247
That is one example right there that Teresa has put up.

602
00:54:57,067 --> 00:54:58,108
We have several others.

603
00:54:59,088 --> 00:55:04,151
We just want to make sure that the kids are getting something out of this.

604
00:55:04,451 --> 00:55:07,813
They work their tails off to play down at that field.

605
00:55:07,833 --> 00:55:10,395
And I think as a younger kid growing up,

606
00:55:10,743 --> 00:55:13,405
you always want to be able to play on the high school field.

607
00:55:13,485 --> 00:55:17,609
And the high school field was kind of the top of the line where you want to be playing.

608
00:55:17,729 --> 00:55:24,195
And if you have a nice scoreboard or dugout or a new field, it's, it makes you want to play a little bit harder on that field.

609
00:55:24,915 --> 00:55:31,100
Um, my past team, we just won the greater Boston league this past spring, first time in 10 years.

610
00:55:31,781 --> 00:55:35,044
And, uh, the parents came to me and said, is there anything we can do?

611
00:55:35,064 --> 00:55:38,687
I placed it, uh, just on one of that group and really kind of,

612
00:55:39,124 --> 00:55:40,805
bring some history back to Medford.

613
00:55:41,986 --> 00:55:50,232
I see a lot of scoreboards being placed at the Little League level, but at the Big Diamond, there is no scoreboard at any Big Diamond field in Medford.

614
00:55:50,793 --> 00:55:59,299
And that's Hickey Park, Morrison Park, Barry Park, and Placid Park, where if you're a high school player, you're going to play there.

615
00:55:59,379 --> 00:56:05,524
And I think when you get on the field, you want to be able to say, wow, that scoreboard belongs to us.

616
00:56:05,544 --> 00:56:06,524
It's home of the Mustangs.

617
00:56:09,410 --> 00:56:11,371
Also to honor Momopet Field.

618
00:56:11,391 --> 00:56:16,895
Bill Momopet was a former Red Sox player who grew up in Medford, helped out to the community.

619
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:20,758
And I think having his name on it would be grateful as well.

620
00:56:20,818 --> 00:56:23,039
So that is our idea.

621
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:29,344
I think if we can put something together, we would love to work with you.

622
00:56:30,064 --> 00:56:33,907
And we've also even talked about raising money if we had to do that.

623
00:56:34,667 --> 00:56:38,390
I think the community would come together to try to put this forward.

624
00:56:39,162 --> 00:56:39,863
at the park.

625
00:56:39,963 --> 00:56:46,507
It's been asked by a lot of people, and I think that if we come together as a community, we can get it done.

626
00:56:49,109 --> 00:56:49,830
Thank you very much.

627
00:56:50,290 --> 00:56:50,990
Questions?

628
00:56:51,891 --> 00:56:53,792
Is there lighting at that field right now?

629
00:56:53,832 --> 00:56:54,493
There is not.

630
00:56:54,633 --> 00:56:54,873
Okay.

631
00:56:55,433 --> 00:56:57,335
Is that like a future project you have in mind?

632
00:56:58,355 --> 00:56:59,997
If you want to say future, yeah, absolutely.

633
00:57:00,297 --> 00:57:01,918
It would be a great idea to have that.

634
00:57:02,358 --> 00:57:04,460
And again, I talked about the revenue piece of it.

635
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:07,702
That would help with revenue because

636
00:57:08,764 --> 00:57:12,527
being involved with baseball during the summer, the fields get rented out.

637
00:57:13,227 --> 00:57:19,672
And I think if we sat down with the department that rents out fields, we could really help out there.

638
00:57:19,812 --> 00:57:22,374
But that's something in the future if we decided that.

639
00:57:29,719 --> 00:57:37,385
Well, I think this project is honorable, to be honest with you, and it's probably about

640
00:57:42,908 --> 00:57:44,689
never had a playset park.

641
00:57:45,369 --> 00:57:56,071
And I do remember playing at a playset when I was young, when we used to have round-robin tournaments at the various fields.

642
00:57:56,671 --> 00:57:58,272
We went to Carr Park.

643
00:57:58,332 --> 00:57:59,612
We went to Hickey Park.

644
00:58:00,192 --> 00:58:01,253
We went to Barry Park.

645
00:58:01,273 --> 00:58:02,393
We went to Morrison Park.

646
00:58:02,413 --> 00:58:03,413
We went to Duggar Park.

647
00:58:03,773 --> 00:58:04,933
We went to a playset park.

648
00:58:06,074 --> 00:58:06,834
Never at night.

649
00:58:08,054 --> 00:58:08,494
Okay?

650
00:58:08,634 --> 00:58:09,835
So we don't have lights.

651
00:58:10,055 --> 00:58:11,055
We don't have a scoreboard.

652
00:58:12,856 --> 00:58:21,582
If you go to any high school in this immediate area, any GBL field, every GBL field has a scoreboard.

653
00:58:22,663 --> 00:58:39,955
I believe it's embarrassing to say the least that Medford does not have a scoreboard so that when you go to the game, if you come to the game at the end of the first inning, you have to ask, are we winning?

654
00:58:41,110 --> 00:58:41,750
or are we loose?

655
00:58:42,511 --> 00:58:49,654
So, I am definitely in favor of this proposal, but that's neither here nor there.

656
00:58:50,034 --> 00:58:54,737
In regards to the lights, we'd love to have lights there.

657
00:58:54,757 --> 00:59:05,262
So, as you can see up in the Edgeley field, you know, the soft field gimmick and money handler fits.

658
00:59:06,632 --> 00:59:15,219
Okay, it's a revenue generating process to put lights in and then start to collect from the various teams.

659
00:59:16,881 --> 00:59:26,188
Recently, we had the stone that was put up for Fred Knox.

660
00:59:27,349 --> 00:59:35,096
And at that time, we had a presentation of the stone.

661
00:59:36,085 --> 00:59:39,547
And it was quite exciting.

662
00:59:39,607 --> 00:59:47,172
And there was everybody that was in baseball for the past 35 years or so, maybe 40 years, maybe 50.

663
00:59:47,252 --> 00:59:48,393
I don't even know.

664
00:59:48,433 --> 00:59:57,158
But they were very disappointed that A, we didn't have a scoreboard, and B, we didn't have any facilities.

665
00:59:59,379 --> 01:00:05,243
So if we can work on at least the scoreboard, it would probably be

666
01:00:07,871 --> 01:00:13,956
It will relieve some of the anxiety that baseball teams have when they come and get off the bus.

667
01:00:16,798 --> 01:00:17,099
All right.

668
01:00:18,340 --> 01:00:23,944
Yeah, I'd like to add that we're probably the only high school team that does not have a scoreboard.

669
01:00:25,225 --> 01:00:26,687
All the other sports have a scoreboard.

670
01:00:27,567 --> 01:00:31,170
And I think that, again, it's revenue generated.

671
01:00:31,230 --> 01:00:36,335
And also, the scoreboard that we're looking to try to get would also allow us to have sponsors on it.

672
01:00:37,025 --> 01:00:39,669
sponsors can be able to donate money as well.

673
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:43,995
But hopefully we can make this work.

674
01:00:44,997 --> 01:00:45,858
Thanks.

675
01:00:46,218 --> 01:00:47,160
Question from Jeremy.

676
01:00:48,685 --> 01:00:50,286
Hey coach, thanks for the presentation.

677
01:00:50,626 --> 01:00:57,528
Um, I see that we have several different quotes for different, I'm guessing variations of the scoreboard from you.

678
01:00:57,988 --> 01:01:02,590
Can you just point me to the one that is reflected in the request here?

679
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:10,552
Cause ones for like way more than the request and the other two are, are under what's included.

680
01:01:10,632 --> 01:01:10,952
Thank you.

681
01:01:11,813 --> 01:01:16,234
There is several, uh, quotes and that's due to because of a solar,

682
01:01:17,345 --> 01:01:19,646
The first option, it would be solar.

683
01:01:20,507 --> 01:01:26,329
If that's not possible, then we would have to dig, and we would have to dig a trench.

684
01:01:26,969 --> 01:01:37,574
So again, that would come down to, I know that the price is a little different, but we wanted to get some quotes out there to see, get a rough idea of what we wanted to do.

685
01:01:37,594 --> 01:01:44,777
But that is the reason why there's different quotes in terms of the solar, and if we don't go solar, we would have to dig.

686
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:50,962
Is there one of those quotes that you use to develop the $110,000 request?

687
01:01:52,663 --> 01:01:53,903
There is.

688
01:01:54,263 --> 01:01:55,284
So there is.

689
01:01:56,684 --> 01:01:58,065
Let me share a screen right now.

690
01:01:58,705 --> 01:02:05,688
So that $110,000 is really coming from the trenching that will likely be needed here.

691
01:02:07,519 --> 01:02:13,883
I took that one on and I'm still trying to work with DPW to see what we might be able to do in-house versus going out to contract.

692
01:02:14,003 --> 01:02:18,586
If it goes to contract, it's probably a $35,000 to $40,000 job.

693
01:02:19,586 --> 01:02:23,589
We're looking at a scoreboard of 61,000.

694
01:02:24,470 --> 01:02:30,994
Once we add that trenching in, add a contingency, that's where we landed at the 110,000 number.

695
01:02:31,014 --> 01:02:34,376
I'm happy to elaborate on that if people have more questions.

696
01:02:34,843 --> 01:02:41,746
This one's just that it's a little mushy because I can't, I haven't gotten a firm answer on whether or not DPW can assist.

697
01:02:42,106 --> 01:02:47,548
So, and that's the difference between $0 and $30,000, unfortunately.

698
01:02:47,769 --> 01:02:48,649
That's helpful, Teresa.

699
01:02:48,689 --> 01:02:49,069
Thank you.

700
01:02:49,109 --> 01:02:55,932
So the file that says 1606 ETN, that's the one you've got up there now?

701
01:02:56,172 --> 01:02:56,952
Yeah.

702
01:02:57,173 --> 01:02:57,413
Yes.

703
01:02:57,673 --> 01:02:57,913
Yes.

704
01:02:58,073 --> 01:02:59,454
And that's the one with the pitch count.

705
01:02:59,474 --> 01:03:02,655
There's also one with the sponsorship.

706
01:03:04,366 --> 01:03:07,468
All right, thank you.

707
01:03:10,930 --> 01:03:11,210
Yes.

708
01:03:14,132 --> 01:03:15,733
So there are a couple of different iterations.

709
01:03:15,753 --> 01:03:19,456
There's one with the sponsorship, which would really be that revenue generator.

710
01:03:20,956 --> 01:03:23,498
But it's really a matter of, can we trench?

711
01:03:24,439 --> 01:03:26,280
If not, then can we do solar?

712
01:03:26,980 --> 01:03:31,303
And solar was reflected in this, if I'm not mistaken.

713
01:03:40,387 --> 01:03:44,689
It looks like one of the other quotes has a solar component for about $5,800.

714
01:03:54,103 --> 01:04:02,410
I was thinking if you could speak more on the sponsor information, is it possible for like a sponsor to finance any of this?

715
01:04:03,471 --> 01:04:08,935
Like, I don't know, like, sometimes you see like Coca Cola or something and we're having like a huge name.

716
01:04:09,015 --> 01:04:10,436
I mean, obviously, there's pros and cons to that.

717
01:04:10,476 --> 01:04:16,821
I'm just saying like, if you had a sponsor, be part of this, would that bring the price down?

718
01:04:16,981 --> 01:04:18,303
I have no idea how sponsorship works.

719
01:04:18,503 --> 01:04:21,145
So if you had any more information on that aspect.

720
01:04:22,573 --> 01:04:28,836
Yeah, I mean, my idea of sponsorship would be contracts where they would have it for, let's say, a five-year commitment.

721
01:04:29,716 --> 01:04:32,117
And then we would be able to change that sponsorship.

722
01:04:32,137 --> 01:04:35,799
Obviously, if someone goes out of business, you don't want to have that name there.

723
01:04:36,820 --> 01:04:38,080
But that's how I would look at it.

724
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:42,762
If we did it finance, that would be probably a negotiation between the city and the business.

725
01:04:43,143 --> 01:04:43,383
Right.

726
01:04:45,284 --> 01:04:45,984
Thanks, Doug.

727
01:04:48,130 --> 01:04:49,031
Uh, yeah, coach thing.

728
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:50,993
This is a, this is a great project.

729
01:04:51,394 --> 01:04:53,376
I'm looking forward to seeing this.

730
01:04:54,417 --> 01:05:00,824
This project done this, this place does actually have a much deeper history than I think most people realize.

731
01:05:00,844 --> 01:05:05,268
I think this was the 1st official park in the city's history because it went from.

732
01:05:06,249 --> 01:05:13,172
Within 20 or 30 years from Brooks family farmland to what we see now, at least an initial version of it.

733
01:05:13,272 --> 01:05:22,715
So it goes back, I think, literally to, I think, the 1st park in the city that I believe it was called Brooks playstate back in more than 100 years ago.

734
01:05:22,755 --> 01:05:23,036
I think.

735
01:05:24,912 --> 01:05:28,914
Anyway, it's the question I have, and again, I think I'm a huge, huge fan of this.

736
01:05:28,994 --> 01:05:29,954
It helps a lot of kids.

737
01:05:30,074 --> 01:05:35,336
My brother played for Neffert High back in the day as a baseball team.

738
01:05:37,377 --> 01:05:42,339
Is the opposite, is the reason there are no lights is because the neighbors on Playstead Road don't want them?

739
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:51,782
I've been hearing that for many years, and I think that is the reason, but I'm not sure if that's to confirm that.

740
01:05:52,462 --> 01:05:53,603
I have knocked on those doors.

741
01:05:54,595 --> 01:06:00,419
But I will say the lights now are totally different from 25, 30 years ago.

742
01:06:00,439 --> 01:06:07,323
Obviously, you could control them from your phone, and the lights are just on the field, and they can turn off.

743
01:06:07,343 --> 01:06:08,844
They're not on all night long.

744
01:06:09,824 --> 01:06:15,368
And I really believe that men's missing the opportunity of bringing some revenue for that field.

745
01:06:15,388 --> 01:06:19,310
That field gets used, but only by the high school and maybe some of the youth sports.

746
01:06:19,951 --> 01:06:23,693
There are so many club teams and men's leagues out there that

747
01:06:24,464 --> 01:06:27,667
Medford would be used, I'd say, six out of seven times during the week.

748
01:06:28,268 --> 01:06:29,109
Yeah.

749
01:06:29,249 --> 01:06:34,874
I think it's a different battle for a different day, but I definitely think it's worth revisiting with a new generation, frankly.

750
01:06:35,635 --> 01:06:35,955
Sure.

751
01:06:36,396 --> 01:06:39,118
But I do support this, and I thank you for your presentation.

752
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:40,660
Thank you very much.

753
01:06:41,093 --> 01:06:41,413
Thanks.

754
01:06:41,613 --> 01:06:47,358
I actually have a comment to Doug's last question and a few questions of myself.

755
01:06:49,199 --> 01:07:04,751
The subject of lights at this field was actually an application that came to us in our very first funding round for CPA and was a subject that ended up shaping our application.

756
01:07:06,742 --> 01:07:22,009
process because the request came from a citizen group, an athletic group, directly to the CPC without going through the city channels first.

757
01:07:22,209 --> 01:07:30,533
And so the city was not aware that there was an application for lighting at the field until it came to us.

758
01:07:30,553 --> 01:07:31,073
And so

759
01:07:36,435 --> 01:07:53,203
After some controversy, we created an application process that ensured that requests like that would go through the city rather than directly to us first, because we aren't the arbiters of whether there should be lighting at a place like Deadfield.

760
01:07:53,223 --> 01:07:57,145
That's really a decision that I think should be a consensus before it comes to the CPC.

761
01:07:59,887 --> 01:08:05,750
on the subject of lighting at the field and just general future improvements.

762
01:08:05,830 --> 01:08:14,614
I imagine that even if it's not in the next five years, down the road, we might be thinking about larger improvements to the field.

763
01:08:15,115 --> 01:08:18,216
What is the condition of this field right now?

764
01:08:18,316 --> 01:08:20,417
Is this field always playable?

765
01:08:20,637 --> 01:08:23,279
Is it in rough condition?

766
01:08:23,379 --> 01:08:27,121
I will say that DPW does the best they can with what they have.

767
01:08:27,181 --> 01:08:27,761
Last year,

768
01:08:28,461 --> 01:08:30,982
Um, we did fix the mound area.

769
01:08:31,403 --> 01:08:36,365
Uh, we did not play at the field for the first month because the weather, um, and they were fixing the field.

770
01:08:37,046 --> 01:08:40,847
Um, I would have to say, yeah, we definitely need a new field.

771
01:08:41,168 --> 01:08:42,188
I would, I would say that.

772
01:08:42,208 --> 01:08:45,050
Um, and I think some people would agree with me with that.

773
01:08:45,470 --> 01:08:56,655
Um, if you've been down there and walk the field, the fence is not in great shape and someone could get hurt if someone actually runs into the fence and gets pulled by, you know, a bar or something.

774
01:08:56,695 --> 01:08:57,736
But, um,

775
01:08:58,226 --> 01:09:00,387
Yeah, that's another thing that we can talk about.

776
01:09:00,868 --> 01:09:07,152
But I want to make sure that we can get approved for the scoreboard and we can work through that.

777
01:09:07,172 --> 01:09:17,979
So I know there's an open space and recreation plan that's going to be coming up soon and that things like this might be in the open space and recreation plan to make overall improvements.

778
01:09:18,239 --> 01:09:21,441
But where this comes back to your specific request right now is

779
01:09:25,153 --> 01:09:34,614
Lighting trench solar option would the eventual future desire to put.

780
01:09:36,684 --> 01:09:49,827
to dig a trench to put lighting or to use a solar-powered scoreboard, are those interrelated considerations?

781
01:09:50,027 --> 01:09:55,088
Do we want to make an investment now that we want to go in a different direction in the future?

782
01:09:55,108 --> 01:09:57,008
Are they compatible?

783
01:09:57,728 --> 01:09:58,609
That's a great question.

784
01:09:58,949 --> 01:10:03,650
That's something that we would have to come together and say, what direction do we want to go?

785
01:10:03,930 --> 01:10:04,990
The good news is if

786
01:10:05,577 --> 01:10:10,020
somehow we did get a new field here in the future with lights, the swath can always be moved.

787
01:10:11,141 --> 01:10:14,263
But if you like put in a trench, can the trench be moved?

788
01:10:15,184 --> 01:10:22,649
Or do you, is the solar a waste if you're going to bring power to the site anyway?

789
01:10:22,830 --> 01:10:31,116
Those are good questions that we can definitely take back and ask to the vendor to see what they can do if that happens in the future.

790
01:10:31,836 --> 01:10:34,058
But yeah, I mean,

791
01:10:34,895 --> 01:10:38,556
Ideally, yeah, it would be great to get a new field with lights and a scoreboard all at once.

792
01:10:39,036 --> 01:10:40,296
I don't think that's likely.

793
01:10:40,316 --> 01:10:44,078
That's why we're starting with a scoreboard and see where we go from there.

794
01:10:44,118 --> 01:10:47,218
But we can definitely work together with that.

795
01:10:47,698 --> 01:11:02,462
Yes, I always love to be able to, like, there are all of these different elements of the whole Placeton Park area that we've been asked to address piecemeal, basketball courts, tennis courts, now the baseball scoreboard.

796
01:11:02,983 --> 01:11:04,243
And, you know, like,

797
01:11:07,632 --> 01:11:24,085
It's sort of doing a park renovation in phases, which is really efficient, but I'd like to be able to think about the big picture and know where we're going so that each phase is contributing to the whole.

798
01:11:24,105 --> 01:11:30,049
I think that's a great idea because I also think about a press box and facilities that Reggie said.

799
01:11:31,330 --> 01:11:33,232
If we host a tournament game there,

800
01:11:33,901 --> 01:11:37,244
and another team is coming to our field, there's no bathrooms.

801
01:11:38,305 --> 01:11:42,268
So we say, we've got to find a place somewhere.

802
01:11:42,288 --> 01:11:43,169
I don't know where to go.

803
01:11:43,249 --> 01:11:46,011
But you don't want to do that.

804
01:11:46,251 --> 01:11:48,634
We have a facility, we have a press box, we have a scoreboard.

805
01:11:49,394 --> 01:11:51,576
Right now, I think we're just behind in times with that.

806
01:11:51,596 --> 01:11:52,737
So that's why we're starting here.

807
01:11:52,777 --> 01:11:54,078
But I like your thinking.

808
01:11:56,120 --> 01:12:02,085
Just to a point, one of the things that has occurred on my watch in the park commission is that we've done

809
01:12:02,605 --> 01:12:04,666
Playstead Park, we've done several other parks.

810
01:12:05,347 --> 01:12:08,769
There is electricity at Playstead now.

811
01:12:09,449 --> 01:12:12,751
So I'm a little curious about this trench thing.

812
01:12:12,771 --> 01:12:23,238
I mean, I guess the trench would go from the existing lights, which are now at the basketball court, there's three or four lights at the basketball court.

813
01:12:24,038 --> 01:12:27,760
So there's already an existing trench that goes to that point.

814
01:12:29,493 --> 01:12:46,043
I would imagine that they would probably put the scoreboard on the track side of left field so that everybody can see it because nobody sits on that side of the field to be honest with you.

815
01:12:47,044 --> 01:12:54,548
So I would imagine that it would be a small trench that would be necessary to be dug if we went with electric.

816
01:12:55,090 --> 01:12:58,132
But if we went with solo, it doesn't matter.

817
01:12:58,412 --> 01:12:58,872
Okay.

818
01:12:59,712 --> 01:13:15,660
And so, you know, when you're looking at when you're talking about piecemeal, well, yeah, you're piecemealing it, but it's a necessary evil to have a scoreboard so that you can know what's going on, on the field.

819
01:13:16,059 --> 01:13:19,782
Yeah, I mean, my calculation is not so much.

820
01:13:19,842 --> 01:13:21,763
Do we need a scoreboard or not?

821
01:13:21,903 --> 01:13:35,273
But really, like, how do we make sure that this investment lines up the next investment that we're going to be asked to make so that everything is going to, in the end, work together?

822
01:13:35,293 --> 01:13:40,157
You know, you mentioned the condition of the field.

823
01:13:41,374 --> 01:13:48,635
Last year there was an investment made for the infield and the mound area and so on and so forth.

824
01:13:48,675 --> 01:13:55,337
They put in new grass within the diamond and so on and so forth.

825
01:13:55,837 --> 01:14:08,819
There is a company in Rhode Island that would actually have done a much better job on that particular field because it has a leveling component to its

826
01:14:10,464 --> 01:14:15,126
procedures and would have eliminated a lot of the holes that are in the outfield.

827
01:14:15,766 --> 01:14:18,127
We've talked about this in the past.

828
01:14:18,247 --> 01:14:28,350
I understand what you're saying about piecemeal, but when your resources are limited, you do what you can when you can.

829
01:14:28,510 --> 01:14:29,010
Exactly.

830
01:14:29,030 --> 01:14:31,191
I saw a question from Anna.

831
01:14:31,211 --> 01:14:33,592
I know we're out of time, but

832
01:14:34,629 --> 01:14:42,992
I'm just looking at this neighborhood and I'm imagining how just knowing how this part of town feels about change.

833
01:14:43,512 --> 01:14:56,137
And I'm just imagining how these neighbors would feel about like facilities, lights, renting the fields out every night, more people coming for out of town games because there's all these facilities and whatever.

834
01:14:56,157 --> 01:15:00,959
And I'm like having a hard time picturing that flying in that specific community.

835
01:15:00,979 --> 01:15:02,880
And it just makes me wonder, like,

836
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:15,550
Is Pleistead the future, like obviously it's the past of where Medford baseball has always been, but is that also the future or is there a consideration of moving it somewhere that's like not in a neighborhood and especially a neighborhood that hates change?

837
01:15:16,671 --> 01:15:18,433
I have heard that.

838
01:15:18,473 --> 01:15:20,214
We are not alterable in West Medford.

839
01:15:20,475 --> 01:15:22,396
Just to put that out there, okay?

840
01:15:22,456 --> 01:15:23,898
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

841
01:15:23,938 --> 01:15:29,262
Not that the whole neighborhood hates change, but many individuals in that neighborhood dislike change greatly.

842
01:15:30,758 --> 01:15:33,479
Yeah, again, that would come down to what the city decides.

843
01:15:33,499 --> 01:15:35,940
I know that they talked about maybe a new Medford High School.

844
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:38,180
Those are those are great questions.

845
01:15:39,220 --> 01:15:48,903
And like, if that were the case, is a scoreboard something is where I was thinking like projecting the future is a scoreboard of physical structure that could potentially be moved to a new Medford.

846
01:15:49,343 --> 01:15:49,523
Yes.

847
01:15:49,603 --> 01:15:50,744
A new location.

848
01:15:50,824 --> 01:15:51,084
Yes.

849
01:15:51,364 --> 01:15:51,624
OK.

850
01:15:51,644 --> 01:15:52,644
That was the only thing.

851
01:15:52,664 --> 01:15:53,044
Yeah.

852
01:15:53,064 --> 01:15:58,026
And I'm like, I'm having a really hard time picturing this becoming like a destination.

853
01:15:58,852 --> 01:15:59,752
Do you know what I mean?

854
01:15:59,832 --> 01:16:03,473
It's a great area because there's so much land there, but you're right, it's a neighborhood.

855
01:16:03,493 --> 01:16:06,793
But I think wherever you go, I think you're going to run into a neighborhood.

856
01:16:06,833 --> 01:16:08,154
But again, that's future.

857
01:16:09,614 --> 01:16:11,574
We're starting with something with a school board.

858
01:16:11,594 --> 01:16:12,254
We'll see how we get it.

859
01:16:12,274 --> 01:16:17,935
Yeah, and that's why we have the open space and recreation plan to answer those big community questions.

860
01:16:18,075 --> 01:16:18,356
Sure.

861
01:16:18,856 --> 01:16:22,116
I just had one last thing I know, Teresa, we need to move on.

862
01:16:22,236 --> 01:16:26,217
One last thing is you had mentioned earlier fundraising.

863
01:16:27,216 --> 01:16:31,980
And I wonder how, like, tell me more about fundraising.

864
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:39,045
What could we do to like maybe make CPA funding a match to what the community is willing to give for?

865
01:16:39,065 --> 01:16:51,295
Yeah, I mean, it was thought between the parents and some business owners where if we did some kind of GoFundMe page, let's see what the community would raise.

866
01:16:51,355 --> 01:16:54,858
And then maybe the difference or you guys match what we raise.

867
01:16:54,938 --> 01:16:55,318
I just,

868
01:16:56,217 --> 01:17:00,819
I think the community would help out in that situation if we had to go that route.

869
01:17:01,620 --> 01:17:02,960
It was an idea.

870
01:17:03,501 --> 01:17:04,581
We haven't put anything together.

871
01:17:04,601 --> 01:17:10,364
We wanted to do this first and see where we stood, but it is an idea that we could try to do that.

872
01:17:10,544 --> 01:17:18,028
So, just like you were here, we had a previous conversation about private funding.

873
01:17:18,548 --> 01:17:42,001
if it would be possible for you to maybe set a goal for private funding and let Teresa know before we have our deliberations in December, you know, we might be able to consider a budget reflecting what you think you can gain from private funding, because that would be really helpful.

874
01:17:42,041 --> 01:17:45,543
That would make funding available for some of these other really important projects.

875
01:17:46,457 --> 01:17:49,900
that we're seeing on a very, very tight budget this year.

876
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:51,281
Yeah, absolutely.

877
01:17:51,621 --> 01:17:51,921
Great.

878
01:17:52,421 --> 01:17:52,742
Thank you.

879
01:17:53,082 --> 01:17:55,203
So we have a couple months to game plan?

880
01:17:55,564 --> 01:17:58,626
Yeah, absolutely.

881
01:17:58,666 --> 01:18:08,012
The plan to have this completed, if it does pass, was to try to have it done before the season, which is the spring in 2020, which is March or April.

882
01:18:09,393 --> 01:18:13,056
Speaking to the vendors, they can do it even if the weather's terrible.

883
01:18:15,259 --> 01:18:19,962
If we didn't get an agreement and approved, they can work on it right away, so.

884
01:18:20,283 --> 01:18:22,824
Our timeline, we should be able to make a decision in the winter.

885
01:18:23,205 --> 01:18:23,565
Perfect.

886
01:18:23,925 --> 01:18:24,185
Yeah.

887
01:18:25,426 --> 01:18:25,646
Yeah.

888
01:18:26,367 --> 01:18:27,128
Any other questions?

889
01:18:29,309 --> 01:18:29,749
We're good.

890
01:18:30,190 --> 01:18:30,830
Thank you.

891
01:18:31,110 --> 01:18:34,112
Thank you very much for your time.

892
01:18:34,173 --> 01:18:35,914
Thanks.

893
01:18:36,114 --> 01:18:37,595
Yeah, I'll give you a call.

894
01:18:37,635 --> 01:18:38,696
I'm calling everybody tomorrow.

895
01:18:38,836 --> 01:18:39,576
Yeah, absolutely.

896
01:18:45,496 --> 01:18:49,640
And the next coach, just so you're aware, Valerie did hop on.

897
01:18:50,701 --> 01:18:51,882
So hi, Valerie.

898
01:18:54,564 --> 01:18:56,266
Just wanted to let you know that.

899
01:18:56,346 --> 01:18:58,107
I told her I was dying earlier.

900
01:18:58,127 --> 01:18:58,367
Perfect.

901
01:18:58,467 --> 01:19:00,149
All right.

902
01:19:00,189 --> 01:19:05,013
So up next, we have the Slenderman and White from Foxhole.

903
01:19:05,033 --> 01:19:07,175
We're only going to have her come on up here.

904
01:19:08,862 --> 01:19:09,902
This report is online as well.

905
01:19:09,962 --> 01:19:11,063
Thank you.

906
01:19:11,083 --> 01:19:12,264
Thank you very much.

907
01:19:12,324 --> 01:19:14,164
You don't need to say it if you don't want to.

908
01:19:14,264 --> 01:19:16,345
It seems to be the popular thing to do.

909
01:19:16,365 --> 01:19:17,066
That's the report.

910
01:19:17,226 --> 01:19:17,826
I had no idea.

911
01:19:17,866 --> 01:19:19,027
I just walked in at the same time.

912
01:19:19,087 --> 01:19:19,327
Oh, yes.

913
01:19:19,367 --> 01:19:20,367
I was very hurt by that.

914
01:19:20,427 --> 01:19:20,727
All righty.

915
01:19:37,221 --> 01:19:38,041
Thank you.

916
01:19:38,301 --> 01:19:39,602
You're welcome.

917
01:19:39,682 --> 01:19:44,823
Introduce yourselves, just a few minutes, tell us about your project, and then I'll ask you questions.

918
01:19:45,263 --> 01:19:45,603
Great.

919
01:19:45,703 --> 01:19:49,584
So first of all, thank you very much for having us here and for considering our application.

920
01:19:50,624 --> 01:19:51,605
So I'm Kevin Simon.

921
01:19:51,985 --> 01:19:53,205
This is my wife, Hilary White.

922
01:19:53,325 --> 01:19:57,706
We moved to Medford a little under two years ago, settling here.

923
01:19:58,146 --> 01:20:04,628
The house we bought is a fairly historic house in the Warren Simmons Historic District in West Medford, where our

924
01:20:06,411 --> 01:20:15,273
Calculus is probably the second oldest house in the immediate neighborhood that was built by the person who first lived there and the historic nature of the house.

925
01:20:19,894 --> 01:20:24,455
The community of West Medford brought us out here, and that's something that we're really excited about.

926
01:20:24,475 --> 01:20:27,055
We've been working on restoring the house ourselves.

927
01:20:27,075 --> 01:20:28,176
We've got one-year-old now,

928
01:20:35,732 --> 01:20:39,053
And so it's been a handful doing that restoration, much of the work ourselves.

929
01:20:39,774 --> 01:20:43,175
But in addition to that, we have a really cool structure, the carriage house.

930
01:20:43,755 --> 01:20:52,579
I've been told that it's one of the sort of like there's maybe about a dozen similar structures that are connected to lots like this.

931
01:20:52,759 --> 01:21:01,603
And so we have been really interested, since we were drawn to the historic structure of the house and the property, we would really love to find a way to preserve this.

932
01:21:01,763 --> 01:21:04,024
And so through and restoring.

933
01:21:04,799 --> 01:21:11,441
And so through that process, we've also been seeing the conversation around affordability in Medford.

934
01:21:11,901 --> 01:21:14,381
It's a really big topic, making more affordable housing.

935
01:21:14,401 --> 01:21:25,704
I'm probably not going out too far on a limb to say that West Medford in particular has been a unique neighborhood in this conversation around change and adding density.

936
01:21:26,324 --> 01:21:28,885
And so we see here as a structure that

937
01:21:29,466 --> 01:21:36,830
adds invisible density with off-street parking in a way that also restores some of Bedford's historical structures.

938
01:21:36,850 --> 01:21:40,572
So, Hilary, can I tell you about the plan?

939
01:21:40,632 --> 01:21:45,074
Yeah, so the project is going to take place over two phases.

940
01:21:45,494 --> 01:21:47,535
The first is around stabilizing the structure.

941
01:21:48,176 --> 01:21:52,538
The pictures on the previous slide, those are the current condition of the building.

942
01:21:54,119 --> 01:21:56,720
Candidly, the last owners didn't take good

943
01:21:57,243 --> 01:21:57,743
care of it.

944
01:21:58,564 --> 01:22:07,770
It was a structure that was actually, they wanted to tear down, but because the home is in the Martin Simmons historic district, it was able to save the structure, which is pretty amazing story.

945
01:22:07,810 --> 01:22:11,292
And I think really speaks to sort of the relevance of this as an asset.

946
01:22:12,733 --> 01:22:18,037
So there does need to be work around stabilizing the structure first to make sure that we really preserve it for future generations.

947
01:22:18,817 --> 01:22:22,860
But we think there's this opportunity to expand it into the one bedroom unit on that second floor.

948
01:22:24,233 --> 01:22:28,475
One thing that's really unique about this building is the footprint is quite large already.

949
01:22:28,596 --> 01:22:29,876
It's 600 square foot.

950
01:22:30,416 --> 01:22:47,425
And so that means we can have a 600 square foot apartment on this second level, which would include a full kitchen, a separated dedicated bedroom, a bathroom with the, there's gonna be a plan for a washer and dryer in there, as well as a private roof deck, so private outdoor space.

951
01:22:47,905 --> 01:22:50,247
We'll maintain the two-car garage on the bottom.

952
01:22:50,267 --> 01:22:52,668
And if you go to the next slide,

953
01:22:54,031 --> 01:22:57,432
This is a markup of what the outside of the structure will look like.

954
01:22:57,452 --> 01:23:05,896
Hopefully it'll look quite familiar because we're really intending to really keep this historical integrity of the structure as much as we can.

955
01:23:05,916 --> 01:23:12,759
The only real sort of changes to the exterior that we'd be making would be for the livability of that one bedroom unit.

956
01:23:12,779 --> 01:23:15,800
So adding out the dormer and then some windows on that second floor.

957
01:23:15,820 --> 01:23:19,142
Then on the last slide,

958
01:23:20,302 --> 01:23:27,947
Just to really be transparent on how we see this project fitting in and supporting the CPC's objectives is really around two areas.

959
01:23:28,007 --> 01:23:40,654
The first is around this additional affordable housing and the second around the restoration of a historical structure that's really sort of becoming, you know, an extinct, excuse me, breed in the city of Medford and Boston area.

960
01:23:41,314 --> 01:23:43,396
But on the additional affordable housing front,

961
01:23:45,667 --> 01:23:58,314
We just talked about West Medford being a really unique area, but thinking creatively about how can we bring in additional housing in a way that doesn't really change the deal of the neighborhood.

962
01:23:58,334 --> 01:24:10,801
We're using the existing footprint of an existing structure to be able to bring in a new housing unit that we think that there's potential to support either a low or medium income household.

963
01:24:12,535 --> 01:24:30,088
And then on the historic preservation front, you know, a lot of things I've touched on, this building has been neglected, but really seen it as a rare asset that's worth preserving, something that, you know, the city has intervened on before, and so continuing to make sure that it's available for future generations.

964
01:24:31,088 --> 01:24:39,995
And I think the last thing that we wanted to share is, you know, we recognize this is a little bit of a different application, is my understanding that you guys typically see,

965
01:24:41,103 --> 01:24:42,984
So we appreciate you guys considering it.

966
01:24:43,084 --> 01:24:49,269
We think that there's kind of this existential question facing the Boston area around affordable housing.

967
01:24:49,309 --> 01:24:52,131
How do you build more in places that people really want to live?

968
01:24:52,151 --> 01:24:53,111
How do you make it affordable?

969
01:24:53,131 --> 01:24:58,595
And we think we have an opportunity here to really thread that needle while also preserving a historic structure.

970
01:24:59,936 --> 01:25:04,979
So really happy to have that conversation with you to figure out, can we make this work?

971
01:25:06,100 --> 01:25:06,540
Thank you.

972
01:25:08,702 --> 01:25:09,382
Please.

973
01:25:10,490 --> 01:25:11,891
Thanks for coming and presenting this.

974
01:25:12,091 --> 01:25:21,936
I'm curious what led to the decision to preserve the two-car garage versus create a space that could support more than just one bedroom.

975
01:25:21,956 --> 01:25:29,840
I don't know if that's part of the actual building's structural limitations or... I think it's a mixture.

976
01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:34,983
We like the idea of having extra space of the two-car garage.

977
01:25:35,003 --> 01:25:37,644
We don't plan on necessarily using it as a two-car garage.

978
01:25:38,303 --> 01:25:41,706
workshop, so there's personal reasons why we wanted to keep it as is.

979
01:25:42,187 --> 01:25:47,972
Also, the cost of one unit, the proposition of restoring the structure and adding one unit was pretty expensive.

980
01:25:48,933 --> 01:25:59,142
I don't think we don't have the pockets to create two structures, and we also have a structure with two units, and so that's kind of the reasoning there.

981
01:26:00,123 --> 01:26:03,606
I think also it would substantially change

982
01:26:08,310 --> 01:26:11,492
have garage doors or carriage doors or anything like that on it?

983
01:26:13,254 --> 01:26:13,814
Good question, though.

984
01:26:20,219 --> 01:26:21,000
Other questions?

985
01:26:21,380 --> 01:26:21,901
Haley?

986
01:26:25,263 --> 01:26:27,805
Roberta, did this qualify?

987
01:26:28,145 --> 01:26:32,529
I mean, just talking offhand, is this actually something that we could hypothetically approve?

988
01:26:33,477 --> 01:26:35,580
I see that it qualifies in two areas.

989
01:26:36,060 --> 01:26:49,155
It qualifies in preserving the exterior, making exterior restoration of this carriage house that's visible from the street.

990
01:26:51,258 --> 01:26:53,140
For historic preservation alone,

991
01:26:54,089 --> 01:27:01,214
we would have a question of whether it would be a priority to preserve a privately owned residence.

992
01:27:01,834 --> 01:27:17,564
That is something that has come up in the past and the committee has either deemed it not to be a priority or we have put requirements or conditions on a project that homeowners felt were not worth the grant.

993
01:27:18,124 --> 01:27:21,927
But the other part of this project of creating an affordable unit

994
01:27:24,287 --> 01:27:31,075
That is very much one of our objectives is to create new affordable units.

995
01:27:31,415 --> 01:27:40,666
So, as an affordable housing project, anything that creates this housing unit and makes it permanently affordable.

996
01:27:41,633 --> 01:28:04,424
Would be eligible, but that permanent affordability is something that there is a, there's a guideline that we would have to follow to establish that permanent affordability with a long term deed restriction and and we could probably use city resources to help carry out the responsibilities of the of the deed restriction.

997
01:28:05,789 --> 01:28:12,433
But yeah, so I mean, this is like a very going to be it would be extremely involved process for the homeowner.

998
01:28:12,573 --> 01:28:16,095
I mean, it kind of opens the doors to like, who would be doing the leasing?

999
01:28:16,135 --> 01:28:21,318
Like, who would be, you know, receiving the rental income, I would assume, right?

1000
01:28:21,438 --> 01:28:25,920
I mean, is this going to be deed restricted for affordability, like in perpetuity?

1001
01:28:28,723 --> 01:28:32,406
And then, yeah, I think there's just the question of, they're just looking at the application.

1002
01:28:32,466 --> 01:28:36,990
So they're requesting from us $461,000 and that they're saying that that's 50%.

1003
01:28:37,810 --> 01:28:41,113
So that means the total cost of this project is pushing a million dollars.

1004
01:28:42,474 --> 01:28:45,036
Obviously, whatever you guys, correct me if I'm wrong.

1005
01:28:45,056 --> 01:28:47,278
So obviously, whatever you guys want to do with your money, that's awesome.

1006
01:28:47,298 --> 01:28:52,782
But I feel like that's a really large ask of the CPC to make one bedroom

1007
01:28:54,538 --> 01:28:55,859
ADU affordable unit.

1008
01:28:56,420 --> 01:29:00,243
And I'm the housing person on this committee, like go housing.

1009
01:29:00,323 --> 01:29:02,825
But to me, this feels like a crazy ask.

1010
01:29:02,845 --> 01:29:07,729
But I totally appreciate you guys' comments.

1011
01:29:07,769 --> 01:29:09,471
That's kind of where I'm at with this.

1012
01:29:09,491 --> 01:29:12,073
To clarify, the $460 is the total cost of the project.

1013
01:29:17,316 --> 01:29:21,239
And so their request is the one-to-one match, so it would be half of that kind from the CPC.

1014
01:29:21,679 --> 01:29:22,220
The 235.

1015
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:23,040
Exactly.

1016
01:29:23,721 --> 01:29:24,041
I'm sorry.

1017
01:29:24,081 --> 01:29:25,402
Maybe I misread that.

1018
01:29:25,942 --> 01:29:28,284
And then I just think we maybe need to see a better budget.

1019
01:29:29,905 --> 01:29:36,870
The Gmail from Mr. Go-To-Bed, which is a crazy last name, Mr. Go-To-Bed.

1020
01:29:37,010 --> 01:29:39,212
But I just think we need to see harder numbers.

1021
01:29:39,872 --> 01:29:40,092
Yeah.

1022
01:29:41,734 --> 01:29:42,074
That's all.

1023
01:29:42,254 --> 01:29:42,994
Yeah.

1024
01:29:43,655 --> 01:29:45,676
And then also, as a point of clarification,

1025
01:29:46,905 --> 01:29:55,148
done some research into what it costs to build affordable housing, and this is actually in line or less than, like the total project cost is less than what it typically takes.

1026
01:29:55,168 --> 01:30:02,810
Per unit cost is actually pretty affordable for an affordable housing unit to create an affordable housing unit.

1027
01:30:03,510 --> 01:30:07,412
But until, but I feel, I mean, yeah, this is what I do every day.

1028
01:30:08,152 --> 01:30:14,894
But until we see actual numbers showing that per unit costs, I mean, I don't know if there's any consideration taken into account, like the cost for

1029
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:21,143
the historic aspect of this, all of the huge markups that were going to come with this project.

1030
01:30:26,526 --> 01:30:30,869
What we have, what Theresa just pulled up, is the preliminary quote from the builder.

1031
01:30:31,469 --> 01:30:32,509
So he's come out.

1032
01:30:32,549 --> 01:30:34,030
He's inspected the structure.

1033
01:30:34,050 --> 01:30:37,672
So this would be accounting for the historical nature.

1034
01:30:38,053 --> 01:30:43,436
I also know that Ryan, our architect, has worked with him on other historical buildings, so has experience

1035
01:30:44,655 --> 01:30:50,993
Historic type homes, so just to be clear, this is a specific quote coming from the visit to the.

1036
01:30:56,315 --> 01:31:21,565
With respect to administering the long-term deed restriction, I would imagine that the Affordable Housing Trust or the city's affordable housing staff might be able to help to facilitate that, you know, the management of renting the units out, you know, overseeing the affordability restriction.

1037
01:31:22,326 --> 01:31:24,507
So, you know, there might be

1038
01:31:26,550 --> 01:31:30,012
there would hopefully be a way to take that off of the homeowner's hands.

1039
01:31:31,313 --> 01:31:36,656
I will say that we do monitoring annually for other entities.

1040
01:31:37,697 --> 01:31:48,084
We're also aware that this will be a decent amount of investment of our time and energy into figuring out what this is, and being the first ones to try out this model and sort of being guinea pigs with it.

1041
01:31:48,264 --> 01:31:55,048
We've been guinea pigs on lots of projects in the past before, and so we're not afraid of being the first people to try this out and see it through.

1042
01:31:55,585 --> 01:32:04,928
Also knowing that, right, this is successful and this does work and this is a cost effective way to bring affordable housing in an invisible way into Medford, especially West Medford.

1043
01:32:04,968 --> 01:32:09,669
I think that's gonna be something that's really worth the time and is something that we would happily put that effort in for.

1044
01:32:09,689 --> 01:32:11,069
Thank you.

1045
01:32:11,629 --> 01:32:12,370
Chairman?

1046
01:32:12,550 --> 01:32:14,330
I just want one follow up, Teresa.

1047
01:32:14,350 --> 01:32:20,892
Do you think that this could potentially be a good project for the Housing Trust to vet and determine funding?

1048
01:32:22,448 --> 01:32:26,750
Potentially, with their specialization and knowledge.

1049
01:32:27,590 --> 01:32:29,811
We may ask them to consult on this one.

1050
01:32:29,851 --> 01:32:40,295
But seeing as this request is half housing, half historic preservation, I would see value in bringing this to them as a consultant when they review this as a courtesy thing.

1051
01:32:41,136 --> 01:32:44,857
Would that satisfy your curiosity, Kayleen?

1052
01:32:46,338 --> 01:32:47,778
Or are you saying it's a feeling?

1053
01:32:47,798 --> 01:32:49,579
I just have concerns about this in general.

1054
01:32:49,639 --> 01:32:50,099
But that's OK.

1055
01:32:50,119 --> 01:32:50,479
Go ahead.

1056
01:32:50,579 --> 01:32:51,480
Move on to Jeremy.

1057
01:32:51,500 --> 01:32:52,020
He has a question.

1058
01:32:53,962 --> 01:32:55,523
You all actually answered my question.

1059
01:32:55,643 --> 01:32:56,764
Sorry, I forgot to lower my hand.

1060
01:32:56,784 --> 01:32:58,386
Doug?

1061
01:33:01,188 --> 01:33:06,032
Yeah, I think this is uncharted waters for us a little bit.

1062
01:33:06,332 --> 01:33:11,236
I've never seen one like this in the time I've been on this board.

1063
01:33:11,857 --> 01:33:19,543
But it's interesting to me because I just would note that the per cost unit that we've seen for affordable housing is

1064
01:33:21,034 --> 01:33:23,276
is substantially higher than this over the years.

1065
01:33:23,376 --> 01:33:25,617
It's been 700, 800,000.

1066
01:33:25,977 --> 01:33:32,962
There's an article in Today's Globe that over a million dollars for the ones in Porter Square that are 100% affordable.

1067
01:33:34,202 --> 01:33:36,964
That is in the cover of the business section today.

1068
01:33:37,024 --> 01:33:42,047
That's just kind of the complexities and the subsidies and the really

1069
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:50,305
difficult environment for putting together affordable housing makes it two or three times what a market unit would be.

1070
01:33:50,325 --> 01:34:01,594
If I was building a 200-unit apartment building, we'd be building it for 350 grand a unit at market rate, but that's just not the world of affordable housing.

1071
01:34:01,674 --> 01:34:03,976
I think this is intriguing to me.

1072
01:34:05,837 --> 01:34:10,881
Obviously, there are priorities we need to discuss as a group, but I think it's really worthwhile.

1073
01:34:10,901 --> 01:34:19,226
And I do like that it's killing two birds with one stone here, so to speak, in terms of the preservation, which would normally not be enough to get it over the finish line.

1074
01:34:19,286 --> 01:34:23,609
But with the public benefit being the unit, I think it probably would.

1075
01:34:24,089 --> 01:34:28,592
I think conceptually, I think that it's just different than anything we've seen before.

1076
01:34:33,208 --> 01:34:36,149
about the accuracy of the budget or the veracity of it.

1077
01:34:36,970 --> 01:34:38,210
We've gotten several quotes.

1078
01:34:38,250 --> 01:34:41,471
We've done our best to get an idea, a pretty firm idea of what phase one is.

1079
01:34:41,491 --> 01:34:44,852
So we're pretty comfortable with those costs and what those look like.

1080
01:34:45,272 --> 01:34:47,713
It's fair to phase two that there's, that's further out.

1081
01:34:47,793 --> 01:34:49,254
We haven't done as many quotes on that.

1082
01:34:49,514 --> 01:34:58,177
And so if you have a reason to think that our budget's wrong, we offline love to get that feedback and love to get advice on how to increase the accuracy of that,

1083
01:34:59,288 --> 01:35:05,290
As homeowners who are looking to make a good decision about going into this, we'd like to make the most amount of information as possible.

1084
01:35:05,650 --> 01:35:10,592
So if there's anyone here who has advice on how to improve that, we greatly appreciate that offline.

1085
01:35:10,612 --> 01:35:14,393
Great.

1086
01:35:14,973 --> 01:35:22,816
Just going back to my original question about the unit and the garage, not to obsess about that, but I'm just thinking about creating a support.

1087
01:35:22,956 --> 01:35:24,857
I agree with everything Doug just said.

1088
01:35:24,877 --> 01:35:25,997
It's a cool idea.

1089
01:35:26,017 --> 01:35:27,858
You guys seem like great guinea pigs.

1090
01:35:28,641 --> 01:35:29,521
That all seems good.

1091
01:35:30,382 --> 01:35:34,043
Um, but I'm just stuck on the one bedroom.

1092
01:35:34,343 --> 01:35:48,428
Like that seems like so much effort to put into creating a one bedroom affordable unit versus like, could this be a unit with two bedrooms or that could sustain a family?

1093
01:35:48,828 --> 01:35:50,769
Um, so that's just where my mind is going.

1094
01:35:50,829 --> 01:35:51,989
It just seems like a very

1095
01:35:52,842 --> 01:35:55,783
limited outcome to such an energy intensive project.

1096
01:35:55,803 --> 01:35:58,683
And I'm just curious if there's any like flexibility with that.

1097
01:35:58,703 --> 01:36:11,065
And I because I'm not in the affordable housing universe, I'm kind of curious for people who are like, are one bedroom units like standard for an affordable housing development?

1098
01:36:11,125 --> 01:36:13,706
Is that the minority of units like I don't actually know?

1099
01:36:13,726 --> 01:36:17,986
So that's probably the majority are not bedroom units.

1100
01:36:18,506 --> 01:36:22,127
If it's being if it's being considered ADU, then yeah, one bedroom.

1101
01:36:24,072 --> 01:36:28,862
Like this is in a neighborhood with like families basically.

1102
01:36:28,982 --> 01:36:32,108
There's a need for all bedroom sizes everywhere.

1103
01:36:32,128 --> 01:36:32,569
Yeah.

1104
01:36:34,558 --> 01:36:40,083
If somebody said, hey, I want to build a three-bedroom affordable unit, the city would do backflips.

1105
01:36:40,103 --> 01:36:42,284
Nobody's building over two bedrooms.

1106
01:36:42,505 --> 01:36:49,951
Those West Medford people are going to really get mad about that one.

1107
01:36:50,131 --> 01:36:53,774
There's this massive carriage house that's like a block from my house on Thatcher.

1108
01:36:53,794 --> 01:36:54,635
I don't know.

1109
01:36:54,695 --> 01:36:55,675
Are you familiar with that one?

1110
01:36:55,715 --> 01:36:56,916
It's so massive.

1111
01:36:57,077 --> 01:37:00,539
And I'm like, if they built a one-bedroom unit, I would die.

1112
01:37:00,559 --> 01:37:01,981
It's so big.

1113
01:37:02,021 --> 01:37:03,262
And that's why I'm just, yeah.

1114
01:37:05,328 --> 01:37:06,769
No, that's a really good question.

1115
01:37:06,789 --> 01:37:12,711
And I think for us, it's sort of, you know, we're, we have a certain amount of money that we spend on this.

1116
01:37:12,791 --> 01:37:21,534
And I think because there's other things about stabilizing the structure that grows in scope in terms of the foundation and other things that perhaps the cost of the project too.

1117
01:37:24,435 --> 01:37:25,815
Right.

1118
01:37:26,456 --> 01:37:27,816
Thank you.

1119
01:37:28,616 --> 01:37:28,837
Yes.

1120
01:37:28,917 --> 01:37:30,697
Just a question for you.

1121
01:37:31,137 --> 01:37:32,678
Is there existing funding in this now?

1122
01:37:33,698 --> 01:37:35,539
There is not plumbing, there's electrical.

1123
01:37:35,899 --> 01:37:42,964
I probably have to upgrade the panel for it to be a local structure, but we would need to have water and sewer going to the building.

1124
01:37:43,344 --> 01:37:49,428
The reason why I ask is because some years ago, up in the hillside, there was a fire.

1125
01:37:49,448 --> 01:37:54,752
A young tough student was living in a carriage house.

1126
01:37:55,432 --> 01:38:00,635
The carriage house didn't have any plumbing, had electricity.

1127
01:38:01,656 --> 01:38:02,877
The young lady lost her life.

1128
01:38:03,394 --> 01:38:04,015
in the fire.

1129
01:38:05,235 --> 01:38:20,987
At the after the occurrence, the city said something to the effect they made a resolution that carriage houses could no longer be utilized as domicile.

1130
01:38:21,968 --> 01:38:25,430
I don't know whether that's ever been changed, to be honest with you.

1131
01:38:25,891 --> 01:38:28,473
So I just a suggestion.

1132
01:38:29,093 --> 01:38:32,736
But you know, before we go through this exercise, please,

1133
01:38:33,757 --> 01:38:37,840
you know, find out and we'll probably do some more homework on our own.

1134
01:38:37,900 --> 01:38:45,166
Well, I don't, I think that that, I don't think that became an ordinance or, you know, codified in the zoning or anything.

1135
01:38:45,206 --> 01:38:51,091
There's a guy right next door to me who has a carriage house twice as tall as that.

1136
01:38:51,111 --> 01:38:57,616
And he did some renovations and so on and so forth, but they would not allow him to put plumbing back there.

1137
01:38:58,535 --> 01:38:59,916
And it wasn't that long ago.

1138
01:39:00,056 --> 01:39:10,345
I'm just letting you know, because it would be terrible for you to go through all this exercise and then find out, no, you can't do it.

1139
01:39:10,966 --> 01:39:12,247
That would be awful.

1140
01:39:12,627 --> 01:39:14,969
And I appreciate it.

1141
01:39:15,130 --> 01:39:16,251
And we also have Ryan.

1142
01:39:16,271 --> 01:39:23,397
I'm not sure if he's on mute, but I know he's also talked to the building department, showed our preliminary architectural plans.

1143
01:39:23,517 --> 01:39:25,479
I think we've gotten an initial

1144
01:39:26,022 --> 01:39:28,683
sort of indication that this seems possible and feasible.

1145
01:39:29,043 --> 01:39:33,045
I'm not sure if you have any comments, Ryan, or if that came up.

1146
01:39:34,846 --> 01:39:50,252
Yeah, I'll just add that we were before the building commissioner, and that's one of the reasons why we have to move the building forward off of the lot line, not only to move setback, but to allow clearance on all sides for life safety purposes so the fire department can get to it if need be.

1147
01:39:54,487 --> 01:39:57,891
But still, any and all feedback is welcome, and we're looking into it.

1148
01:39:57,911 --> 01:40:06,662
I mean, if this is... I think the accessory utility unit, when that was passed, I think that basically superseded everything, didn't it?

1149
01:40:06,843 --> 01:40:07,563
Didn't it, Teresa?

1150
01:40:07,724 --> 01:40:11,208
I would think that's the intent of that legislation, is to...

1151
01:40:12,352 --> 01:40:13,893
You're talking about the APU language?

1152
01:40:15,053 --> 01:40:19,914
The situation that happened 20 years ago would have been a building that was not up to code.

1153
01:40:20,835 --> 01:40:29,537
And so bringing this building up to code would have to meet compliance with... I'll do due diligence.

1154
01:40:29,557 --> 01:40:40,881
Why not find out exactly what the opposition would be, if there were opposition, before they start going down that road?

1155
01:40:43,792 --> 01:40:48,214
I feel confident that it's not in effect.

1156
01:40:48,494 --> 01:40:58,756
And to Doug's point, the local legislation that passed at the state level would supersede any prohibitive or restrictive local language like that.

1157
01:40:58,896 --> 01:41:06,259
Governor Healey signed into law, and gosh, it went into effect January this year, that ADUs are allowable by right.

1158
01:41:07,879 --> 01:41:10,620
They have to still meet local zoning setbacks.

1159
01:41:12,111 --> 01:41:14,873
plot restrictions, excuse me, I'm losing my voice.

1160
01:41:14,993 --> 01:41:18,296
But it would be, I think it would supersede anything.

1161
01:41:18,536 --> 01:41:19,737
I will do due diligence.

1162
01:41:20,097 --> 01:41:25,001
The other half that I wear for City Hall is the Historic District Commission support person.

1163
01:41:25,021 --> 01:41:26,402
So I will find out.

1164
01:41:26,542 --> 01:41:28,463
But I feel confident that we're good.

1165
01:41:28,763 --> 01:41:29,564
That I should confirm.

1166
01:41:30,785 --> 01:41:31,565
Excuse me.

1167
01:41:35,448 --> 01:41:35,848
Thank you.

1168
01:41:36,049 --> 01:41:39,151
I think, any more questions on this project?

1169
01:41:42,018 --> 01:41:42,398
Thank you.

1170
01:41:42,438 --> 01:41:43,078
Thanks very much.

1171
01:41:43,198 --> 01:41:49,520
I really appreciate your work to envision all of this and to apply it for funding.

1172
01:41:50,040 --> 01:41:50,441
Thank you.

1173
01:41:50,501 --> 01:41:53,542
I really appreciate you taking the time to listen to us and consider our program.

1174
01:41:53,782 --> 01:41:54,062
Yes.

1175
01:41:55,282 --> 01:41:59,923
It's not a question for them, but just for us to think about.

1176
01:41:59,943 --> 01:42:10,307
I have neighbors that just did an ADU project to put the mother in the

1177
01:42:12,070 --> 01:42:14,691
converted their garage to an ADU, put the mother in the ADU.

1178
01:42:15,611 --> 01:42:34,397
So like, theoretically, if that was a carriage house, and they converted their carriage house, and they abided by the affordable housing deed, whatever, but with the intention of putting their own family member in that unit, would that change things?

1179
01:42:34,897 --> 01:42:35,597
So I think

1180
01:42:36,037 --> 01:42:46,200
that the requirements for the long-term deed restriction would require an arm's length marketing of the unit.

1181
01:42:46,640 --> 01:42:49,361
So you couldn't build that for a family member.

1182
01:42:50,181 --> 01:43:00,444
So then we would be essentially preferential to people who were not trying to have intergenerational living.

1183
01:43:03,740 --> 01:43:18,228
Yeah, no, I mean, as a member of the affordable housing trust, I would love to see us be able to create a program that could provide people with funding to build 80 years if they put a.

1184
01:43:19,125 --> 01:43:21,807
long term or permanent deed restriction on their unit.

1185
01:43:22,587 --> 01:43:24,929
But that program doesn't exist right now.

1186
01:43:25,229 --> 01:43:27,290
And so this is a one off request.

1187
01:43:28,351 --> 01:43:44,742
And the reason why I think like this is potentially a viable project is because they're looking to make an arm's length, you know, affordable unit that would be kind of the equivalent of an inclusionary unit.

1188
01:43:45,430 --> 01:43:54,257
just one singleton unit in the community that the city could help to monitor and market.

1189
01:43:55,358 --> 01:44:01,503
Totally, but it's a one-off project, but it's also precedent-setting, so I'm just trying to think through, like, what is the precedent?

1190
01:44:01,763 --> 01:44:09,710
Yeah, I think that one of the key things here is that arm's length marketing is the precedent, but I would also

1191
01:44:11,070 --> 01:44:19,216
You know, the fact, as I mentioned, the fact that it's historic preservation makes it appropriate to bring to the CPC.

1192
01:44:21,097 --> 01:44:26,601
If it wasn't historic preservation, I would rather see it go to the Affordable Housing Trust.

1193
01:44:29,683 --> 01:44:34,326
But this is the first time for us to have a project like this.

1194
01:44:34,506 --> 01:44:36,087
So you're right, the precedent setting.

1195
01:44:36,107 --> 01:44:39,389
I think it's a good suggestion that Teresa made to

1196
01:44:42,300 --> 01:44:48,802
to consult with the Affordable Housing Trust and think about how can we support each other on this project.

1197
01:44:48,822 --> 01:44:53,044
I just want to be aware that we have Tim McGovern.

1198
01:44:55,624 --> 01:44:56,405
Good conversations.

1199
01:44:56,465 --> 01:44:58,465
I don't mean to... Hi, Tim.

1200
01:44:59,706 --> 01:45:02,186
I don't mean to... Hi, Tim.

1201
01:45:02,346 --> 01:45:02,806
How are you?

1202
01:45:02,826 --> 01:45:03,547
Is it 1-1-2-1?

1203
01:45:03,567 --> 01:45:03,627
1-1-5-1.

1204
01:45:03,667 --> 01:45:04,067
No, sorry.

1205
01:45:04,087 --> 01:45:04,147
1-1-2-1.

1206
01:45:08,810 --> 01:45:08,910
It's 1121.

1207
01:45:09,250 --> 01:45:13,312
Thank you.

1208
01:45:14,092 --> 01:45:19,994
I'm right inside both bathrooms on the third floor, so people are always asking me which code.

1209
01:45:20,394 --> 01:45:19,994
1151.

1210
01:45:20,794 --> 01:45:23,856
1151.

1211
01:45:20,935 --> 01:45:23,856
Yes, that one I do know.

1212
01:45:23,896 --> 01:45:24,916
I don't know the ladies one.

1213
01:45:25,236 --> 01:45:26,176
It's late, folks.

1214
01:45:26,417 --> 01:45:26,757
All right.

1215
01:45:27,077 --> 01:45:27,657
Hi, Tim.

1216
01:45:28,757 --> 01:45:28,957
Hi.

1217
01:45:28,997 --> 01:45:29,618
Sorry to interrupt.

1218
01:45:29,638 --> 01:45:35,200
Were we planning a break at any point, or are you trying to power through?

1219
01:45:36,042 --> 01:45:37,462
Um, Tim is our last one.

1220
01:45:38,002 --> 01:45:39,803
Um, so I leave it up to the committee.

1221
01:45:39,823 --> 01:45:44,244
Do we want to have a bio break for a few minutes or muscle through?

1222
01:45:44,304 --> 01:45:45,084
Power.

1223
01:45:45,544 --> 01:45:46,004
Power.

1224
01:45:46,024 --> 01:45:46,304
Power.

1225
01:45:46,364 --> 01:45:46,584
Okay.

1226
01:45:46,624 --> 01:45:51,145
I have bedtime in 13 minutes I got to get to.

1227
01:45:51,706 --> 01:45:52,226
Alrighty.

1228
01:45:53,266 --> 01:45:56,827
Um, the last application of the evening.

1229
01:45:56,847 --> 01:46:02,648
It's, um, from DPW, the Oak Grove Cemetery Buildings Preservation.

1230
01:46:03,279 --> 01:46:05,984
We are joined by DPW Commissioner Tim McGivern.

1231
01:46:07,065 --> 01:46:08,167
Tim, you have the floor.

1232
01:46:09,550 --> 01:46:10,471
Thank you, Teresa.

1233
01:46:10,611 --> 01:46:11,571
Hello, everybody.

1234
01:46:11,871 --> 01:46:14,153
Thanks for hearing me out tonight.

1235
01:46:14,693 --> 01:46:24,740
So obviously the number I put in the application package is big, but it's a smaller number compared to a much bigger project.

1236
01:46:25,460 --> 01:46:32,685
So the reason I'm going to get to why it's just the service building we're submitting.

1237
01:46:33,886 --> 01:46:38,549
But what I want to really get to tonight is just really updating you on where we are on the project, because

1238
01:46:39,307 --> 01:46:43,489
You guys have funded the design thus far, so I think it's really important to do that.

1239
01:46:43,769 --> 01:46:45,389
1st, I have a presentation.

1240
01:46:45,409 --> 01:46:51,792
I don't know if Teresa, I can go ahead and share my screen and start it.

1241
01:46:51,972 --> 01:46:54,193
That's going to be an issue.

1242
01:46:54,213 --> 01:46:55,453
I just made your sugar.

1243
01:46:57,914 --> 01:46:59,295
All right, let me just get back to the beginning.

1244
01:47:10,812 --> 01:47:11,572
All right, can you see that?

1245
01:47:12,212 --> 01:47:12,473
Yes.

1246
01:47:14,074 --> 01:47:14,274
Okay.

1247
01:47:17,175 --> 01:47:17,536
All right.

1248
01:47:17,636 --> 01:47:24,440
So I think I recognize, I know many of you, I recognize faces from different boards and commissions.

1249
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:25,781
So hello everybody.

1250
01:47:26,301 --> 01:47:33,425
So this project is, you know, I'd say right now we're in a big breath, sort of big picture, look at it.

1251
01:47:34,606 --> 01:47:38,048
You know, the drawing phase is at design development.

1252
01:47:38,068 --> 01:47:39,209
We're finishing that up right now.

1253
01:47:40,470 --> 01:47:45,076
But we had a meeting on it recently, which spurred a lot of conversation.

1254
01:47:46,158 --> 01:47:49,162
So, you know, we're going to start there, but I got a couple of goals for tonight.

1255
01:47:49,182 --> 01:47:51,325
If I can.

1256
01:47:53,729 --> 01:47:57,350
So like I stated, I want to update this commission on the project in general.

1257
01:47:57,370 --> 01:48:05,673
I want to present some progress on what I'm calling operational evaluation, which you'll understand a little bit more about that as we go along.

1258
01:48:06,893 --> 01:48:14,516
I want to present to you just a due diligence alternative, because that's where we're at in this project is making sure we're looking at all of our options.

1259
01:48:14,596 --> 01:48:16,617
They're all on the table, and we're discussing them intelligently.

1260
01:48:18,077 --> 01:48:22,839
And then fourth, review funding and cost considerations for that alternate one.

1261
01:48:25,538 --> 01:48:35,427
So start with the project review, as I think many of, you know, the Oak Grove cemetery, the historic section of it, and just the cemetery in general is considered historic.

1262
01:48:36,167 --> 01:48:43,709
meets a lot of the check marks for the National Register of Historic Places, including both of these buildings.

1263
01:48:44,429 --> 01:48:50,871
So a lot of information has been given to you guys in the past since we started this project.

1264
01:48:51,791 --> 01:48:55,172
We completed a conceptual design and study in 2023.

1265
01:48:55,532 --> 01:49:04,155
And we are at the end stages of design development right now, including both buildings.

1266
01:49:05,276 --> 01:49:17,773
And that includes a DD plan review, which we started and is underway and we have a DD cost estimate review with the designer foster architecture on October 16th, 2025, which is this Thursday.

1267
01:49:21,287 --> 01:49:26,251
This may look familiar if you were on the commission last year, this was the red number.

1268
01:49:26,271 --> 01:49:27,872
There was the request last year.

1269
01:49:27,932 --> 01:49:34,397
We haven't spent that money yet, but that is that's for construction construction documents.

1270
01:49:34,817 --> 01:49:42,583
So, basically, where we're at, if you're looking at this is D. D design phase 1, we're at the end of that phase.

1271
01:49:43,304 --> 01:49:45,926
So basically completed and as, you know, the.

1272
01:49:46,766 --> 01:49:54,268
Continuing construction documents is funded, but we're going to take a pause for the moment before we continue.

1273
01:49:56,529 --> 01:50:02,291
Just a reiteration of the historical status in the cover page for the report.

1274
01:50:03,978 --> 01:50:09,803
This is also information that I presented to you last time, but we don't have the estimate yet and we'll get it later this week.

1275
01:50:10,183 --> 01:50:23,473
But just from discussions, I believe it's going to probably be more since now that they've had a chance to dive in and design things and take a good close look at both buildings from just my.

1276
01:50:24,774 --> 01:50:26,735
My gut tells me it's going to be quite a bit more.

1277
01:50:26,795 --> 01:50:27,576
Well, maybe not quite a bit.

1278
01:50:27,616 --> 01:50:28,276
I'm not quite sure.

1279
01:50:28,616 --> 01:50:35,300
But the service building or the maintenance building, $6.24 million construction costs.

1280
01:50:35,860 --> 01:50:53,570
And then the office or caretaker's building, $1.63 million, $7.87 for the total, which is why the number I put on the application to you folks is the lower number, the $6.24 million number for just the service building.

1281
01:50:57,723 --> 01:51:00,845
So just some highlights of the design development plans.

1282
01:51:01,085 --> 01:51:05,547
I didn't put the whole plan set in the presentation, and they're not even actually final yet.

1283
01:51:05,928 --> 01:51:08,509
I'm going to receive them with the estimates, but I think they're mostly there.

1284
01:51:09,910 --> 01:51:11,191
There are some links to those drawings.

1285
01:51:13,792 --> 01:51:14,853
questioning brings us there.

1286
01:51:15,593 --> 01:51:36,166
Caretaker supporters, the recommendations are, you know, what we would need to do is a complete electrical overhaul, including a new service to the building, and then retrofitting the building for ADA requirements, which is pretty substantial, as well as utility upgrades onto the site, including water, taking a look at sewer, and potentially gas.

1287
01:51:37,967 --> 01:51:40,689
So, you know, those are very expensive things, obviously.

1288
01:51:41,169 --> 01:51:41,870
Service building,

1289
01:51:42,999 --> 01:51:48,701
The maintenance garage, the most expensive thing on this building is the repair of the cast stone that is falling apart.

1290
01:51:49,482 --> 01:51:55,704
And then also there's some significant costs associated with retrofit for ADA requirements for the bathrooms, etc.

1291
01:51:56,685 --> 01:51:58,605
And then some utility upgrades for that building as well.

1292
01:52:00,926 --> 01:52:04,288
Just the cover sheet showing the team that is working on the project.

1293
01:52:07,641 --> 01:52:14,223
Existing conditions, I think, you know, actually, no, this is the new conditions just a shot of the plans.

1294
01:52:15,623 --> 01:52:17,983
And then this is the maintenance building plan set.

1295
01:52:19,204 --> 01:52:20,764
And a nice elevation of the plan set there.

1296
01:52:20,784 --> 01:52:25,365
All right back to the operational evaluation progress.

1297
01:52:25,605 --> 01:52:26,425
So, you know.

1298
01:52:29,078 --> 01:52:38,860
One of the things I've been asked to do is take a close look at existing spaces, how they relate to the present and future cemetery operational needs.

1299
01:52:39,360 --> 01:52:42,781
So I've been trying to dig into that while the design's been going on.

1300
01:52:44,221 --> 01:52:54,323
And one of the things that came out of that is the cemetery superintendent, who's the caretaker and lives in the caretaker's quarters, is not something that is needed or is the norm anymore.

1301
01:52:56,703 --> 01:52:59,444
The person that's the current superintendent will retire at some point.

1302
01:53:00,184 --> 01:53:05,626
And after that, the city doesn't necessarily see a need for a caretaker for the cemetery.

1303
01:53:06,546 --> 01:53:08,487
The caretaker would just be for the building at that point.

1304
01:53:08,507 --> 01:53:09,728
Okay.

1305
01:53:13,636 --> 01:53:18,958
The preservation, and we discovered this a lot during DD, and we've asked a lot of questions about this.

1306
01:53:19,599 --> 01:53:31,484
Preserving the service building, the maintenance building, the one we all like, the stone one, doesn't really benefit us or improve our operational needs from that building.

1307
01:53:31,564 --> 01:53:32,745
It's a little bit undersized.

1308
01:53:32,805 --> 01:53:34,026
It's not modern.

1309
01:53:34,706 --> 01:53:37,087
We could never really get it to be like a modern garage.

1310
01:53:38,308 --> 01:53:41,089
If we were to build walls to get it to be like a modern garage.

1311
01:53:41,709 --> 01:53:46,553
It would make the size smaller and it's already small to begin with on the inside.

1312
01:53:47,074 --> 01:54:00,025
So we're learning a lot about how making that building operational for us is maybe not the best use of money because it doesn't really improve our operations at the end of the day.

1313
01:54:00,926 --> 01:54:03,868
But it kind of keeps them at status quo and makes them worse.

1314
01:54:04,829 --> 01:54:05,169
All right.

1315
01:54:07,119 --> 01:54:11,803
And then just another small thing is that there's a demolished small garage on the site that Pat has left over.

1316
01:54:12,143 --> 01:54:16,027
And that provided some needed operational space we need to think about as well.

1317
01:54:17,288 --> 01:54:32,842
So part of the due diligence, what we've been asked to look at is, well, what if we move those operational spaces, got rid of the residential portion, and looked at creating a new building with a relatively small office, public counter?

1318
01:54:33,622 --> 01:54:37,145
and some municipal garage space for the cemetery crew.

1319
01:54:37,625 --> 01:54:40,467
And that may be all of it or a portion of it, I'm not sure.

1320
01:54:41,548 --> 01:54:46,692
You know, we have to take a close look at this alternative just to get some costs and what some realistic things would look like.

1321
01:54:47,672 --> 01:54:57,339
But, you know, we'd want to preserve the... From my understanding is really most entities involved here want to preserve the service building.

1322
01:54:57,699 --> 01:55:00,642
That seems to be the real...

1323
01:55:01,522 --> 01:55:05,284
desire, and I understand that.

1324
01:55:05,464 --> 01:55:11,227
But we could reduce, minimize the operational space, and that could reduce preservation costs.

1325
01:55:11,808 --> 01:55:18,271
If we're not building it like an operational building, if we're building it more as a monument, that could save some costs there.

1326
01:55:19,112 --> 01:55:27,977
Build a new building that would include multiple garage bays, small office space, maybe some employee space for muster, things like that, public counter, restrooms.

1327
01:55:29,578 --> 01:55:32,139
Potentially, these are all potentials for an alternate to look at.

1328
01:55:33,140 --> 01:55:36,582
Any new building will be designed to match the historical significance of the location.

1329
01:55:37,103 --> 01:55:44,428
So I think most folks are familiar with how they try to do that, make the new building match what, make it look like it's supposed to be there.

1330
01:55:46,149 --> 01:55:47,430
And then raise the caretaker's quarters.

1331
01:55:48,335 --> 01:55:50,738
I put that on there just because it's a, it's a cost consideration.

1332
01:55:50,758 --> 01:55:52,560
It would be end of life type deal with the building.

1333
01:55:54,102 --> 01:55:56,825
But I understand the desire to preserve that building as well.

1334
01:55:59,869 --> 01:56:03,293
Then that this, this scheme works with that, but it's more expensive.

1335
01:56:03,713 --> 01:56:07,475
to think about taking it down as a full project and turn into a blank slate on that site.

1336
01:56:08,496 --> 01:56:12,458
We did explore some, well, what are some alternate uses of the building?

1337
01:56:12,818 --> 01:56:15,760
Unfortunately, cemetery rules seem pretty strict.

1338
01:56:16,380 --> 01:56:20,142
The only thing you can use cemetery land for is cemetery uses.

1339
01:56:24,630 --> 01:56:27,831
And then a part of this, funding and cost considerations.

1340
01:56:28,051 --> 01:56:30,533
So I talked about some of the operational considerations.

1341
01:56:31,893 --> 01:56:35,935
These are just, I don't know why the presentation sets it up this way, but they're all kind of independent things.

1342
01:56:35,975 --> 01:56:37,015
But they all kind of lead to each other.

1343
01:56:37,035 --> 01:56:38,516
They're all reasonable and logical.

1344
01:56:39,056 --> 01:56:45,999
The service building, removing operational space, like we talked about, that's a potential for cost reduction.

1345
01:56:46,099 --> 01:56:49,441
And that is eligible for CPA funding, from my understanding.

1346
01:56:49,641 --> 01:56:50,901
I think that's clear.

1347
01:56:52,742 --> 01:56:55,084
But the new building would not be eligible for CPA funding.

1348
01:56:55,524 --> 01:56:56,284
So that's important.

1349
01:56:56,304 --> 01:57:00,507
It kind of makes a stark clear line between what is and what isn't.

1350
01:57:00,567 --> 01:57:08,072
The city would like to prioritize operational and public building space due to the large backlog of capital expenses.

1351
01:57:08,432 --> 01:57:09,633
And I have that on my next slide.

1352
01:57:09,673 --> 01:57:15,737
The mayor wanted me to definitely show that to you and help you understand that particular bullet point.

1353
01:57:16,938 --> 01:57:22,741
Building a new building will provide better operations at a potential significant cost savings, and potential is important.

1354
01:57:24,502 --> 01:57:31,186
There is space on the site to complete a new building before transferring operations, which minimizes schedule-related costs.

1355
01:57:31,926 --> 01:57:36,689
A new building minimizes risks associated with renovations on existing structures with unknowns.

1356
01:57:37,129 --> 01:57:43,213
A new building means maintaining the existing caretaker's quarters until the superintendent position is vacated.

1357
01:57:44,394 --> 01:57:48,377
And as I mentioned, you then have separated project timelines and funding sources.

1358
01:57:48,837 --> 01:57:50,378
So the project is bifurcated.

1359
01:57:50,399 --> 01:57:52,640
Let's see what else.

1360
01:57:53,541 --> 01:58:02,367
This is that chart that kind of shows the backlog of city spending and what the administration is battling with.

1361
01:58:02,668 --> 01:58:03,488
It's not very clear.

1362
01:58:03,608 --> 01:58:04,209
Sorry about that.

1363
01:58:04,469 --> 01:58:05,350
I'm realizing that now.

1364
01:58:05,590 --> 01:58:11,634
So I believe it was shared on the social media pages for the city and is on the website and all that.

1365
01:58:14,223 --> 01:58:14,743
Next steps.

1366
01:58:16,485 --> 01:58:19,707
Well, we're going to continue our review of the DD plan set and the cost estimate.

1367
01:58:20,508 --> 01:58:23,930
And we're going to complete that operational evaluation.

1368
01:58:24,390 --> 01:58:39,882
And hopefully, we're going to have, while we will, we'll have our architects on board with that discussion and what some potential concepts might be and what might make sense to cost so we can compare it to the preservation efforts.

1369
01:58:42,614 --> 01:58:43,334
Let's see what else.

1370
01:58:43,534 --> 01:58:46,155
And then we'll present to the cemetery board, which we haven't presented this.

1371
01:58:46,195 --> 01:58:50,977
You guys are the first ones to see this from a presentation standpoint and where we're at.

1372
01:58:51,457 --> 01:58:59,240
So this will be put in front of the cemetery board at some point, but wanted to talk to you folks obviously on your schedule.

1373
01:59:03,161 --> 01:59:03,621
So that's it.

1374
01:59:03,781 --> 01:59:04,942
Happy to take questions.

1375
01:59:05,822 --> 01:59:06,983
And I can go back to slides.

1376
01:59:07,063 --> 01:59:07,923
I have the plans.

1377
01:59:07,943 --> 01:59:10,704
We can take it in whatever direction you folks want to take it.

1378
01:59:13,510 --> 01:59:15,332
French?

1379
01:59:15,412 --> 01:59:17,314
Mr. Brogan, how long before you retire us?

1380
01:59:21,938 --> 01:59:24,200
Can you guys see me too, or just the presentation?

1381
01:59:25,041 --> 01:59:25,842
We can see you.

1382
01:59:26,402 --> 01:59:27,223
Can you hear us?

1383
01:59:27,903 --> 01:59:29,825
Yep.

1384
01:59:29,905 --> 01:59:31,527
Everybody got really little for me, so.

1385
01:59:32,287 --> 01:59:32,708
Interesting.

1386
01:59:34,393 --> 01:59:35,194
So it's all good.

1387
01:59:35,214 --> 01:59:36,757
It's all good.

1388
01:59:37,558 --> 01:59:44,227
I think the answer to your question is is not solid, but have talked to him about this.

1389
01:59:44,548 --> 01:59:48,293
And, you know, he's you know, he doesn't have any sort of hopes for a legacy.

1390
01:59:49,615 --> 01:59:51,496
um, successor or anything like that.

1391
01:59:52,196 --> 01:59:56,838
And he is planning on retiring, but he doesn't have a date set in stone.

1392
01:59:57,378 --> 02:00:12,324
So there is a realistic number there that I'm going to continue to try to pin him down on because that is a cost because we would basically either need to keep the building up to living conditions or we would need to find an apartment for him for the rest of his tenure.

1393
02:00:21,022 --> 02:00:22,983
I have a question.

1394
02:00:24,344 --> 02:00:27,845
So I understand, Jeremy, you go first.

1395
02:00:27,985 --> 02:00:29,326
I'll come back to my question.

1396
02:00:30,567 --> 02:00:31,147
Well, I'm sorry.

1397
02:00:31,167 --> 02:00:32,968
I had to step away for bedtime.

1398
02:00:33,148 --> 02:00:34,889
So I missed a lot of your presentation, Tim.

1399
02:00:34,909 --> 02:00:38,731
But would you be willing to share this with us so we can review it?

1400
02:00:38,771 --> 02:00:40,392
I know you said it's new.

1401
02:00:41,772 --> 02:00:42,012
Sure.

1402
02:00:42,313 --> 02:00:43,513
Yeah, my intention was to share it.

1403
02:00:43,533 --> 02:00:46,715
I was making tweaks right up to when I turned it on.

1404
02:00:46,895 --> 02:00:48,175
All right, thank you.

1405
02:00:48,916 --> 02:00:49,116
Thanks.

1406
02:00:49,790 --> 02:00:52,531
So maybe I'll help to fill in, Jeremy.

1407
02:00:52,551 --> 02:01:14,021
So my understanding is that the proposal, the alternatives that you're talking about right now, preserves the utility building and builds a new building that provides for the utilities that we need today, the office space and the operational space.

1408
02:01:14,641 --> 02:01:15,401
And then you'll,

1409
02:01:18,077 --> 02:01:20,940
you'll demolish the caretaker's building.

1410
02:01:21,661 --> 02:01:27,928
What is the future that you envision for the site where the caretaker's building stands right now?

1411
02:01:31,311 --> 02:01:36,076
We would, well, I guess we would build it into the hillside.

1412
02:01:36,097 --> 02:01:38,499
We would probably try to naturalize it into the hillside.

1413
02:01:39,927 --> 02:01:52,791
But also I say that I see, I think we're not even ready to say things like that, though, to tell you the truth, because I think, ideally, from a lay this out perspective, we want to separate the new construction from existing.

1414
02:01:52,831 --> 02:01:55,312
So then we can have a nice separation and transfer.

1415
02:01:55,672 --> 02:01:58,373
So right across the internal street.

1416
02:01:59,793 --> 02:02:05,397
a long place that there's an open space that isn't burial ground that could work for a building.

1417
02:02:05,898 --> 02:02:10,481
But we can't rule out at this point using some of the caretaker's building site.

1418
02:02:10,841 --> 02:02:12,523
I think that would be bad.

1419
02:02:12,563 --> 02:02:14,504
We might need to look at it just to rule it out.

1420
02:02:16,105 --> 02:02:27,414
But the vision for alternative one to look at from a cost scenario would be to raise the building, break up the foundation, bury it, loam and seed it, naturalize it, make a hillside there.

1421
02:02:29,235 --> 02:02:41,345
I feel like it would be really helpful to have a more finished concept of what the future of this portion of the cemetery is.

1422
02:02:41,365 --> 02:02:50,932
If I were on the cemetery board, I would want to know that for sure.

1423
02:02:51,072 --> 02:02:53,895
But it feels like it's not ripe to

1424
02:02:54,716 --> 02:03:03,194
commit funding to until we know where it's going, unless the funding that you're asking for is to help us get to the place of knowing where it's going.

1425
02:03:05,097 --> 02:03:26,135
Right now, the funding question is the idea that they're 2 separate projects and if we're preserving the service building as more of a monument than operational space, it separates the schedule from the operational portion of the project and to look at what that could mean from a cost perspective.

1426
02:03:26,495 --> 02:03:30,477
But, like I said, it wouldn't be the new building and those new things wouldn't be eligible for CPA.

1427
02:03:30,877 --> 02:03:47,623
So, then the only part that's eligible for CPA, I mean, still, it's the major part is preserving of the service building and the city is not able to commit to even a level of funding to for me to bring to report to you for preserving that building.

1428
02:03:48,003 --> 02:04:04,058
because the mayor wants to focus on operational employee space buildings and the like, and the price tag is so large for the preservation of both of these buildings that we're being asked to do our due diligence on the cost to do it.

1429
02:04:06,400 --> 02:04:08,703
and what it might look like to be a new building.

1430
02:04:09,083 --> 02:04:16,072
So I think what they ask is for the CPC to think about what could the CPC commit to preserving this building.

1431
02:04:16,192 --> 02:04:18,295
We know approximately how much it's going to cost.

1432
02:04:18,836 --> 02:04:21,219
We're going to know better on Thursday how much it

1433
02:04:21,659 --> 02:04:24,620
Well, cost will have a design development cost estimate.

1434
02:04:25,020 --> 02:04:36,283
I think it might be a tad more than what we're showing on the concept design, but it will at least give this commission knowledge of what it might cost to build that building and preserve it the way we'd like to see it.

1435
02:04:37,764 --> 02:04:45,406
Compared to obviously your revenue and potential loans, debt service, the city obviously

1436
02:04:46,806 --> 02:04:53,453
You know, you know, has to take out loans for building projects from what I understand the CPC could as well.

1437
02:04:54,494 --> 02:05:03,642
And, you know, we did a lot of discussion about, like, well, what would what would a reasonable contribution look like from the CPC on an annual basis for debt service?

1438
02:05:03,702 --> 02:05:08,747
And what would a reasonable contribution look like from the city on a annual debt service affordability type thing?

1439
02:05:08,767 --> 02:05:10,149
So we looked at a lot of those scenarios.

1440
02:05:10,869 --> 02:05:17,295
Um, and it came to the kind of conclusions that we did, we had to take a closer look at basically separating the 2 projects.

1441
02:05:17,595 --> 02:05:28,884
1 is a preservation project and 1 is more of an immediate operational need for both employees and public as well as operating the cemetery.

1442
02:05:30,075 --> 02:05:44,038
And I should mention, too, that the cemetery board did recently, and I'm not sure if they published it, so to speak, but they have a strategic plan that they've been working on, which I just recently got a copy of from them, which is great to see.

1443
02:05:45,338 --> 02:05:50,239
And, you know, obviously the buildings are on their front and center and part of that plan.

1444
02:05:51,240 --> 02:05:53,080
So, you know, when we.

1445
02:05:54,441 --> 02:05:58,403
Unfortunately, Roberta, we're also not at a point to show you a drawing with potential spaces.

1446
02:05:58,443 --> 02:06:00,984
We don't even know how many square feet we need.

1447
02:06:01,064 --> 02:06:04,706
We know roughly how much we think we might need in a building.

1448
02:06:04,986 --> 02:06:10,068
And then we kind of know what square footage costs of these type of spaces are running these days.

1449
02:06:10,088 --> 02:06:12,829
And we know we have a flat site with pretty good soil.

1450
02:06:13,249 --> 02:06:18,352
But we haven't done the design work to know

1451
02:06:19,432 --> 02:06:22,673
Is this a $1 million building we're talking about?

1452
02:06:22,693 --> 02:06:23,794
A $1.5 million building?

1453
02:06:24,114 --> 02:06:24,734
I'm not sure.

1454
02:06:24,754 --> 02:06:28,515
I just know that we have feasibility on the site for something like this.

1455
02:06:29,195 --> 02:06:39,679
And if preserving a wooden structure, the residential caretaker's building, is going to include a whole bunch of new utilities, gutting the place for electric, and then putting it all back together again.

1456
02:06:39,699 --> 02:06:44,541
And we're already up to well over $1 million for that, and I expect it to be higher.

1457
02:06:45,601 --> 02:06:48,122
So making sure that we're doing the correct

1458
02:06:49,137 --> 02:06:54,319
where the right cost moves on these projects and making sure we're looking at it closely.

1459
02:06:54,339 --> 02:06:55,419
So that's what I meant in the beginning.

1460
02:06:55,459 --> 02:06:58,661
We're at the place where, OK, we're seeing design work now.

1461
02:06:58,961 --> 02:07:00,241
We're seeing how much this is going to cost.

1462
02:07:00,261 --> 02:07:01,382
We're seeing what it looks like.

1463
02:07:01,802 --> 02:07:02,862
And we're taking a step back.

1464
02:07:02,902 --> 02:07:03,923
We're taking a breath.

1465
02:07:04,403 --> 02:07:08,725
And we're bifurcating the projects at this point so we can look at them separately.

1466
02:07:08,745 --> 02:07:10,706
Thank you.

1467
02:07:11,586 --> 02:07:13,026
Did you have another question?

1468
02:07:13,747 --> 02:07:16,768
So I could, Doug, go ahead.

1469
02:07:17,595 --> 02:07:21,217
Well, finish your question first, Roberta, if you don't mind.

1470
02:07:21,237 --> 02:07:32,842
So I would ask a little bit more about what uses could occur in the utility building and or the residential structure.

1471
02:07:33,222 --> 02:07:36,624
The utility building, I understand that it doesn't work as a garage.

1472
02:07:36,804 --> 02:07:44,408
Could it work as a counter space and office for meeting the public or have a gathering space?

1473
02:07:45,368 --> 02:07:51,393
how could we use that building given its constraints that would meet a need for the city?

1474
02:07:52,014 --> 02:08:08,287
And then likewise, the residential building, given that we have so few buildings that are city-owned in the building and a need for space, like our capital needs for space for municipal services,

1475
02:08:09,102 --> 02:08:15,944
Is there anything compatible with that building that we need, like administrative space, archive space?

1476
02:08:16,384 --> 02:08:23,685
I mean, archive could potentially be related to the cemetery tangentially.

1477
02:08:23,885 --> 02:08:36,688
I just wonder whether there's a need that could be met without tearing that building down, especially if you're able to build your operational building separately.

1478
02:08:38,834 --> 02:08:41,296
It's a good point, and I don't think it should be ruled out.

1479
02:08:42,257 --> 02:08:46,901
All I know is right now the cemetery laws are set up, so it would have to be cemetery use.

1480
02:08:48,922 --> 02:08:54,527
But if there's a way to, I think one of the ideas that was floated was, can we parcel out a piece?

1481
02:08:54,927 --> 02:08:55,487
Maybe we can.

1482
02:08:55,968 --> 02:08:57,369
So we're asking legal about that.

1483
02:08:57,409 --> 02:09:00,732
That's kind of part of the due diligence to say, well, is it really a raise?

1484
02:09:00,952 --> 02:09:04,995
Are we really taking that building down, or are we trying something else with it?

1485
02:09:06,737 --> 02:09:14,205
But again, back to the point of why we're looking at the alternate the way we are is because you do have that flexibility without looking at a million different scenarios.

1486
02:09:15,507 --> 02:09:18,890
So that's why the next step is kind of focusing in the direction that we're taking.

1487
02:09:19,391 --> 02:09:21,814
So hopefully that helps answer the question.

1488
02:09:24,857 --> 02:09:25,278
Thanks Doug.

1489
02:09:26,219 --> 02:09:49,496
Yeah, Tim and I have actually been communicating a lot lately, because he's starting to develop plans for the seven acres that the Brooks Estate wraps around that was set aside for cemetery expansion in 1998, but now is starting to be looked at seriously by Tim and the group, the commission, excuse me, the board.

1490
02:09:50,401 --> 02:09:52,182
So, but there's, there's a lot going on.

1491
02:09:52,202 --> 02:10:02,811
There's a lot of moving pieces here, because I see, first of all, I would love that house if there's any way possible just to sell that house and use those funds for things you really need, because you clearly have a massive funding need, right?

1492
02:10:02,831 --> 02:10:10,657
When you're looking for upwards of many millions of dollars for what's on the excellent presentation you proposed here.

1493
02:10:11,377 --> 02:10:19,022
and then expanding the Oak Grove Cemetery into the other side of the access drive from the Brooks Estate, we always think that's another three plus million dollars.

1494
02:10:19,042 --> 02:10:29,688
We're looking at a substantial many millions of dollars for what I believe is probably a cemetery that's got a lifespan, we think 20 years, but maybe not.

1495
02:10:29,808 --> 02:10:37,093
Depending on if you do a crematorium or some, I think there's a larger,

1496
02:10:37,933 --> 02:10:39,295
I think Roberto was asking you to step back.

1497
02:10:39,315 --> 02:11:00,036
I'm thinking I'm asking the same thing, that there's kind of an end game for what's happening at the cemetery that needs to be thought through, you know, for what's happening, what's the actual end date for when there's no more expansion space unless the design changes, you know, and investing, you know, eight or nine million dollars or something that will be

1498
02:11:01,337 --> 02:11:12,729
perhaps be at the end of its lifespan in 20 years is something that I think not only this, this board's going to want to know about, but so the city council or the mayor, right?

1499
02:11:12,929 --> 02:11:15,972
Because the vision you talked about, that document, I haven't seen it.

1500
02:11:16,012 --> 02:11:18,114
It was emailed, but I haven't had a chance to read it yet.

1501
02:11:18,195 --> 02:11:20,837
I think this is a real opportunity to think about

1502
02:11:22,919 --> 02:11:34,065
the entire cemetery globally, what's happening here, to make sure that the design of the expansion is consistent with what you're thinking for the whole parcel, the whole property.

1503
02:11:35,265 --> 02:11:36,666
Because there's so many moving parts here.

1504
02:11:36,686 --> 02:11:39,168
I commend you because you've got a great preservation architect.

1505
02:11:39,208 --> 02:11:40,328
This is a great step forward.

1506
02:11:40,348 --> 02:11:43,170
I'm glad we funded this piece because you needed this.

1507
02:11:43,810 --> 02:11:51,733
But I think now that you have it, you've got to think, okay, now that I know all the pieces and all the costs, what are we really doing with all this?

1508
02:11:51,813 --> 02:12:04,657
I think there's one more step here to kind of say, okay, we have to make choices here on this site, this site, this site, this house, this property, historic, yes, functional, no.

1509
02:12:05,198 --> 02:12:08,779
Now you have all the knowledge and the costs where you're going to have it this week.

1510
02:12:08,979 --> 02:12:11,380
I think there's an incredible opportunity here to now think about

1511
02:12:15,395 --> 02:12:16,715
Don't forget though, don't forget.

1512
02:12:16,775 --> 02:12:22,838
So the end game isn't just done selling plots because the historic part of the cemetery.

1513
02:12:22,878 --> 02:12:23,938
Now we still maintain.

1514
02:12:23,978 --> 02:12:24,698
We still go up there.

1515
02:12:24,738 --> 02:12:25,579
People still visit it.

1516
02:12:25,939 --> 02:12:28,300
So the operational needs of the cemetery don't go away.

1517
02:12:28,800 --> 02:12:32,641
Even if we're done selling plots, even if we're done bearing, we still have operational needs.

1518
02:12:32,661 --> 02:12:33,241
So don't forget that.

1519
02:12:33,621 --> 02:12:34,482
Also, don't forget that.

1520
02:12:35,802 --> 02:12:39,546
We are thinking in a sense that, well, we don't really need a caretaker at our cemetery anymore.

1521
02:12:39,666 --> 02:12:44,109
So that's also a step in the direction of bringing our operations of our cemetery down.

1522
02:12:44,770 --> 02:12:50,375
When I talk about a new building, I'm talking about looking at a scenario for cost purposes.

1523
02:12:50,555 --> 02:12:53,497
If it turns out that a new building is going to cost us, you know.

1524
02:12:54,839 --> 02:13:02,267
A 1,000,008 and save us 6 months, but we're still at 1.2 for renovation, renovating the structure.

1525
02:13:02,327 --> 02:13:08,774
Then, you know, we're, we're in firm ground for, like, you know, back to preserving that structure again.

1526
02:13:08,934 --> 02:13:10,676
So, but right now, you know.

1527
02:13:12,077 --> 02:13:13,899
from an operational need, we don't need that building.

1528
02:13:14,159 --> 02:13:15,500
Selling it is an option, too.

1529
02:13:15,520 --> 02:13:20,604
That would be a nice plus black mark on the balance sheet for the project.

1530
02:13:21,185 --> 02:13:23,426
I just don't know how feasible that is, to tell you the truth.

1531
02:13:24,567 --> 02:13:25,528
We're looking at it.

1532
02:13:26,089 --> 02:13:33,395
But I think there's some repercussions if you go in the reverse of land protection, especially for cemeteries.

1533
02:13:33,455 --> 02:13:34,916
And we're not even sure it's feasible.

1534
02:13:34,936 --> 02:13:37,118
There is a way to do it.

1535
02:13:37,158 --> 02:13:40,200
But we're looking at that at the moment.

1536
02:13:41,443 --> 02:13:56,381
So, but I, you know, I think, I think the cemetery is there to stay for a long time and whatever we do there needs to be lasting because I think we're going to have employees and visitors there for the time being.

1537
02:13:57,382 --> 02:13:57,623
Thank you.

1538
02:13:58,678 --> 02:14:07,641
One suggestion, if you do explore the possibility of selling it, you would want to sell it with a permanent preservation restriction already attached.

1539
02:14:07,721 --> 02:14:20,204
So that's one way in which you're giving up a restriction, but you're also placing a new restriction on it so that it would remain the landmark that it already is.

1540
02:14:20,864 --> 02:14:22,405
So we'd be trading.

1541
02:14:24,285 --> 02:14:37,449
an operational cemetery building for a permanently preserved landmark, rather than giving up a landmark in order to keep it as a cemetery space.

1542
02:14:38,609 --> 02:14:47,671
So there might be, I think, an argument for why it would be palatable to give up that restriction.

1543
02:14:52,358 --> 02:14:55,079
a person who wants to buy a house next to a cemetery.

1544
02:14:55,399 --> 02:14:56,540
You know who made Good Neighbors?

1545
02:15:05,143 --> 02:15:11,366
No, it sounds as though like the cemetery strategic plan is really a critical piece of this.

1546
02:15:11,726 --> 02:15:19,729
And I would love to see that be a public document like that, that there be an opportunity for the

1547
02:15:21,963 --> 02:15:26,144
for the neighborhood to provide some feedback.

1548
02:15:26,504 --> 02:15:30,565
This isn't just a plan for how to sell cemetery plots.

1549
02:15:30,645 --> 02:15:42,527
This is a plan for whether the landmark buildings that are the core of what you see from the street are going to be here in the future or are going to be torn down.

1550
02:15:42,667 --> 02:15:48,308
I would think that the community would want to have some

1551
02:15:50,693 --> 02:15:56,501
Some input or at least understanding of how we get to the decision that we make.

1552
02:15:58,363 --> 02:16:01,046
We make, you make.

1553
02:16:01,147 --> 02:16:06,834
We're making a funding decision, but you're making a decision about what the future of the community looks like.

1554
02:16:09,492 --> 02:16:17,120
Yeah, I think there's a another check in with this group at some point, because, like, I'm saying, like, I was saying before, I'll make my rounds.

1555
02:16:17,160 --> 02:16:18,202
I'll go to the cemetery board.

1556
02:16:18,222 --> 02:16:23,588
They're gonna have lots of questions related to this strategic plan.

1557
02:16:24,008 --> 02:16:27,552
There is a, there is, you know, the idea that.

1558
02:16:30,325 --> 02:16:48,606
the folks out there, the people, the residents, the community should really understand what the costs are associated with preserving these spaces and how to balance the operational needs with the historic preservation piece and how to best do that.

1559
02:16:48,726 --> 02:16:49,707
So I completely agree.

1560
02:16:50,047 --> 02:16:53,088
I don't think any one of us knows exactly where that line should be drawn.

1561
02:16:53,548 --> 02:17:01,471
But ideally, it's a community discussion that says, hey, politicians, here's where we want the line to be.

1562
02:17:02,231 --> 02:17:03,832
So I'm with you there.

1563
02:17:04,612 --> 02:17:09,934
So what I can say, though, is that I feel like there's a lot of this is sort of cutting edge.

1564
02:17:10,054 --> 02:17:17,496
And we're at the point where we know we can say, I think it's healthier to look at the buildings.

1565
02:17:20,051 --> 02:17:24,692
separately, know that one of them has the potential to be a monument.

1566
02:17:25,212 --> 02:17:29,693
One of them, the Wood Frame Caretaker's Quarters, has an unknown future.

1567
02:17:30,313 --> 02:17:32,574
What do the cost scenarios look like for that?

1568
02:17:33,514 --> 02:17:34,954
Is it feasible to sell it or not?

1569
02:17:35,634 --> 02:17:37,635
And if it is, how does that change the game?

1570
02:17:38,195 --> 02:17:45,316
What is a new building cost right across the street that is going to meet operational needs or improve them?

1571
02:17:49,397 --> 02:17:53,238
You know, and how does that integrate with with the preservation of the site?

1572
02:17:53,258 --> 02:17:56,799
So anyway, lots of good questions to answer as we kind of move along.

1573
02:17:56,899 --> 02:17:57,099
So.

1574
02:17:59,780 --> 02:18:07,262
Thank you very much for your time and for your diligence and asking and answering all of these really big questions.

1575
02:18:08,781 --> 02:18:17,405
Yeah, and hopefully we'll have more answers as we go and I'll give Teresa an update on the DD drawings and the cost estimate.

1576
02:18:17,485 --> 02:18:22,447
And I invited her to the meeting too, so she can stay on the cutting edge of this project as well.

1577
02:18:23,888 --> 02:18:24,708
Thank you for that.

1578
02:18:27,330 --> 02:18:27,790
Thank you.

1579
02:18:28,650 --> 02:18:30,591
All right, thanks everybody.

1580
02:18:30,771 --> 02:18:32,472
Go home.

1581
02:18:33,152 --> 02:18:33,973
Thank you.

1582
02:18:34,373 --> 02:18:36,034
This was easier than traffic commission tonight.

1583
02:18:37,217 --> 02:18:39,299
Okay.

1584
02:18:39,359 --> 02:18:40,540
What a fun life you live.

1585
02:18:40,620 --> 02:18:43,462
Oh yeah, it's awesome.

1586
02:18:43,863 --> 02:18:48,947
See ya.

1587
02:18:48,987 --> 02:18:49,888
Did I read that right?

1588
02:18:50,008 --> 02:18:51,729
They're asking for $6 million?

1589
02:18:51,749 --> 02:18:56,173
6 point, like 2.8 times our budget?

1590
02:18:57,514 --> 02:18:58,314
Isn't that a bond?

1591
02:18:59,075 --> 02:18:59,976
That is, yeah.

1592
02:18:59,996 --> 02:19:01,537
They would be talking about a bond.

1593
02:19:01,557 --> 02:19:01,617
Yep.

1594
02:19:03,399 --> 02:19:03,599
Okay.

1595
02:19:04,255 --> 02:19:10,236
and whether we could carry that debt service, to which the answer is no.

1596
02:19:11,097 --> 02:19:20,899
It was estimated that if we were to bond this out in its entirety, that estimate would be about $750,000 to $800,000 a year.

1597
02:19:21,759 --> 02:19:25,460
So we do have a budget that technically could cover that.

1598
02:19:27,201 --> 02:19:31,042
But that might not be the only project that we want to fund for the next 20 years.

1599
02:19:31,182 --> 02:19:31,502
Correct.

1600
02:19:33,608 --> 02:19:34,808
So there is runway.

1601
02:19:37,309 --> 02:19:41,130
But I just want to be sensitive to the time, because it's 9 o'clock.

1602
02:19:43,511 --> 02:19:45,052
The meeting minute, I'm sorry, Roberta.

1603
02:19:45,072 --> 02:19:45,892
Yeah, that's all right.

1604
02:19:46,032 --> 02:19:48,673
Meeting minutes for September 9.

1605
02:19:48,873 --> 02:19:52,534
You may have noticed that there was an attachment in the Dropbox.

1606
02:19:53,495 --> 02:19:56,556
I saw it, and I thought, oh, Teresa already did those minutes.

1607
02:19:56,616 --> 02:19:56,876
Great.

1608
02:19:57,216 --> 02:19:59,216
So I do not have meeting minutes for tonight.

1609
02:19:59,377 --> 02:20:00,097
I apologize.

1610
02:20:01,212 --> 02:20:04,114
I put a placeholder and then completely forgot to actually follow up on that.

1611
02:20:04,514 --> 02:20:05,715
I will have them for next meeting.

1612
02:20:05,735 --> 02:20:09,277
Eric's kissed.

1613
02:20:10,157 --> 02:20:11,898
Administrative updates.

1614
02:20:13,339 --> 02:20:18,542
I only had, you know, I was today asked if this board would be interested in tabling.

1615
02:20:19,682 --> 02:20:24,183
at the November 1st Pumpkin Smash event, which is a fun event.

1616
02:20:25,103 --> 02:20:28,164
It's over at the West Medford Community Center, I believe, again this year.

1617
02:20:28,204 --> 02:20:28,724
No, it's not.

1618
02:20:28,944 --> 02:20:29,324
It's not?

1619
02:20:29,384 --> 02:20:30,485
It's at the McGlynn Elementary.

1620
02:20:30,505 --> 02:20:32,065
It's at the McGlynn Elementary School.

1621
02:20:32,365 --> 02:20:36,226
It's the Saturday after Halloween, 1030 to 1.

1622
02:20:36,266 --> 02:20:44,248
I have not obligated us to attend, but if anybody has a burning desire

1623
02:20:45,485 --> 02:20:47,446
to table at that particular event.

1624
02:20:47,586 --> 02:20:53,227
It's a composting event for, you bring your jack-o-lanterns and you smash them, and it's a lot of fun.

1625
02:20:55,588 --> 02:20:57,348
It's a really fantastic event.

1626
02:20:57,388 --> 02:20:57,689
You're right.

1627
02:20:57,709 --> 02:20:58,869
You're selling it.

1628
02:20:59,209 --> 02:20:59,789
I know I am.

1629
02:20:59,809 --> 02:21:03,730
Imagine axe throwing at pumpkins with lots of children running around.

1630
02:21:05,051 --> 02:21:06,611
So do we want to table at that?

1631
02:21:07,371 --> 02:21:09,252
I'm still parenting my weekend, so I cannot.

1632
02:21:09,612 --> 02:21:10,712
But I might be willing.

1633
02:21:10,792 --> 02:21:11,252
I'm not.

1634
02:21:11,593 --> 02:21:11,913
OK.

1635
02:21:11,973 --> 02:21:12,933
I'll take it offline.

1636
02:21:13,490 --> 02:21:37,268
yeah i'll circulate it but you know just put it out there i'm a little burnt out um but it is it is the season yeah and this would be probably the last one of the season so um but i'll just put in the see if anybody's really loving that idea let me know but i'll email it around and i promise that's all i have for administrative updates truce i have a quick question for you i see there's a

1637
02:21:38,133 --> 02:21:40,374
the COVID memorial folder in there.

1638
02:21:40,414 --> 02:21:42,374
Will we review that next time?

1639
02:21:43,134 --> 02:21:45,075
Yes, I apologize.

1640
02:21:45,115 --> 02:21:50,316
I think I mentioned that right out the gate, but the planning department has that project.

1641
02:21:50,376 --> 02:21:53,157
They have asked if they can present at their November meeting.

1642
02:21:53,717 --> 02:22:03,639
They had a community outreach event, which I went to, and Roberta as well, and they're taking some of that feedback so that

1643
02:22:04,439 --> 02:22:06,861
Application is going to stay pretty solid.

1644
02:22:06,941 --> 02:22:09,103
The design may tweak a little bit.

1645
02:22:09,623 --> 02:22:11,244
And with that, the funding request.

1646
02:22:11,545 --> 02:22:13,806
But it's largely not changing too much.

1647
02:22:13,846 --> 02:22:17,249
But they just asked if we can punch them to November's meeting.

1648
02:22:17,269 --> 02:22:18,850
Thank you.

1649
02:22:19,491 --> 02:22:19,711
Yeah.

1650
02:22:19,871 --> 02:22:23,194
And if anybody has feedback on that one, let me know.

1651
02:22:25,776 --> 02:22:30,560
I feel like for November's meeting, if it's going to go late, we should put the punchy live people at the end.

1652
02:22:30,780 --> 02:22:30,860
OK.

1653
02:22:32,560 --> 02:22:34,922
And the drive-in presentation first.

1654
02:22:35,202 --> 02:22:35,963
OK.

1655
02:22:36,063 --> 02:22:39,226
I think we have a mix of Zoom and in-person.

1656
02:22:39,266 --> 02:22:39,506
Great.

1657
02:22:39,946 --> 02:22:40,627
Yeah.

1658
02:22:42,008 --> 02:22:44,610
And I think those projects won't be as intensive.

1659
02:22:44,630 --> 02:22:47,432
It's a lot of continuation.

1660
02:22:47,692 --> 02:22:48,613
There's one project.

1661
02:22:48,633 --> 02:22:50,114
But anyway, we can get ahead of ourselves.

1662
02:22:50,234 --> 02:22:51,495
And it's 855.

1663
02:22:51,795 --> 02:22:52,156
Yes.

1664
02:22:52,416 --> 02:22:53,837
Well, thank you, everybody.

1665
02:22:53,857 --> 02:22:57,740
That was a great round of presentations.

1666
02:22:57,860 --> 02:23:01,063
Does anyone want to make a motion to adjourn?

1667
02:23:04,721 --> 02:23:05,141
So moved.

1668
02:23:06,222 --> 02:23:06,582
Second.

1669
02:23:09,345 --> 02:23:09,705
All right.

1670
02:23:09,765 --> 02:23:11,046
Did you catch that, Teresa?

1671
02:23:11,366 --> 02:23:13,308
I technically heard Reg first.

1672
02:23:13,368 --> 02:23:14,368
It was Kayleen seconded.

1673
02:23:14,789 --> 02:23:15,049
Kayleen.

1674
02:23:15,089 --> 02:23:16,390
And then Kayleen seconded.

1675
02:23:16,730 --> 02:23:17,190
All right.

1676
02:23:17,651 --> 02:23:19,492
Let it be known, Kayleen seconded.

1677
02:23:19,612 --> 02:23:21,694
All right.

1678
02:23:21,814 --> 02:23:22,855
I've got to call the roll.

1679
02:23:23,435 --> 02:23:24,716
So I've got Reg.

1680
02:23:24,876 --> 02:23:25,116
Yes.

1681
02:23:25,417 --> 02:23:25,617
Ada.

1682
02:23:25,697 --> 02:23:25,957
Yes.

1683
02:23:26,197 --> 02:23:26,518
Doug.

1684
02:23:26,958 --> 02:23:27,258
Yes.

1685
02:23:28,019 --> 02:23:28,479
Jeremy.

1686
02:23:28,939 --> 02:23:29,160
Yes.

1687
02:23:29,940 --> 02:23:30,601
Myesha.

1688
02:23:31,241 --> 02:23:31,481
Yes.

1689
02:23:32,262 --> 02:23:32,882
And Kayleen.

1690
02:23:33,403 --> 02:23:33,623
Yes.

1691
02:23:34,772 --> 02:23:36,013
I didn't miss anyone, did I?

1692
02:23:36,253 --> 02:23:36,473
No.

1693
02:23:36,633 --> 02:23:37,094
Yourself.

1694
02:23:38,014 --> 02:23:38,755
Myself, yes.

1695
02:23:38,915 --> 02:23:39,635
Yes, adjourned.

1696
02:23:39,996 --> 02:23:40,616
Thanks, everybody.

1697
02:23:40,716 --> 02:23:41,557
Appreciate it.

1698
02:23:41,577 --> 02:23:41,837
Thank you.

1699
02:23:41,857 --> 02:23:42,858
See you next month.

1700
02:23:42,898 --> 02:23:43,298
Take care.
