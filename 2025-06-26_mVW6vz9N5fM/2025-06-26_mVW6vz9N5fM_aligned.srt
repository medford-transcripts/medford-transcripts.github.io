1
00:00:02,007 --> 00:00:07,890
All right, good evening and welcome to tonight's meeting of the Medford Community Development Board.

2
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:09,210
My name is Emily Hedeman.

3
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:12,632
I'm the chair of the board and I'm going to call the meeting to order.

4
00:00:13,332 --> 00:00:15,693
Let's begin with some obligatory procedural matters.

5
00:00:17,868 --> 00:00:21,951
This hearing of the Medford Community Development Board is being conducted via remote means.

6
00:00:22,491 --> 00:00:33,759
No in-person attendance of members of the public will be permitted, but every effort will be made to ensure that the public can adequately access the proceedings provided for in Chapter 2 of the Acts of 2023.

7
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:44,487
A reminder that anyone who would like to listen or view this meeting while in progress may do so by accessing the link that was included on the meeting agenda posted on the City of Medford website.

8
00:00:45,109 --> 00:00:53,497
If, despite our best efforts, we are not able to provide real-time access, we will post a recording of this meeting on the City's website as soon as possible.

9
00:00:54,898 --> 00:00:59,923
A reminder that given the remote nature of this meeting, tonight all votes from the Board will be made by roll call.

10
00:01:01,464 --> 00:01:07,250
Please know that project materials for all projects before the Board can be viewed on the City's website, medfordma.org.

11
00:01:11,509 --> 00:01:16,152
And then by clicking on current CD board filings, you can also find the link in the chat.

12
00:01:16,352 --> 00:01:19,193
I believe Daniela or Alicia have just dropped that link in the chat.

13
00:01:21,595 --> 00:01:23,656
We're going to start with roll call attendance for the board.

14
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:25,817
Vice chair, Peter Calves.

15
00:01:27,038 --> 00:01:27,398
Present.

16
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:28,839
Hi, Peter.

17
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:33,581
Ari Goffman-Fishman.

18
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:34,722
Present.

19
00:01:35,523 --> 00:01:35,923
Hey, Ari.

20
00:01:36,803 --> 00:01:37,584
Sabrina Alpino.

21
00:01:38,324 --> 00:01:38,704
Present.

22
00:01:39,425 --> 00:01:39,905
Hi, Sabrina.

23
00:01:41,243 --> 00:01:41,824
Adam Barons.

24
00:01:45,187 --> 00:01:45,747
Annie Strang.

25
00:01:46,748 --> 00:01:47,149
Present.

26
00:01:47,869 --> 00:01:48,390
Hi, Annie.

27
00:01:49,091 --> 00:01:49,211
Hi.

28
00:01:49,271 --> 00:01:49,931
Ben LaValle.

29
00:01:51,052 --> 00:01:51,473
Present.

30
00:01:52,294 --> 00:01:52,714
Hey, Ben.

31
00:01:53,695 --> 00:01:55,717
And myself, Emily Hedeman, is present.

32
00:01:56,437 --> 00:01:59,380
Danielle, can you please introduce any city staff on the call?

33
00:02:00,802 --> 00:02:05,246
Yes, myself, Danielle Evans, senior planner, and we have Alicia Hunt, the

34
00:02:05,903 --> 00:02:08,304
Director of Planning, Development, and Sustainability.

35
00:02:08,364 --> 00:02:19,348
And we also have Amanda Cinchella, who is one of our planners in TDS, who will be helping out with the breakout room for the main meeting when we go into executive session.

36
00:02:20,468 --> 00:02:20,668
Great.

37
00:02:20,828 --> 00:02:21,708
Glad to have you all here.

38
00:02:23,929 --> 00:02:28,931
So as Danielle just alluded to, the first item on the amended agenda is an executive session.

39
00:02:30,242 --> 00:02:48,046
pursuant to general law, C-30A, Section 21A-3, to discuss strategy relating to pending litigation known as New York Capital Investment Group, LLC, via the City of Medford Community Development Board et al., Massachusetts Land Court Case No.

40
00:02:48,066 --> 00:02:48,306
24, MISC 000683, and

41
00:02:57,198 --> 00:03:06,541
If the chair declares that discussing the matter in an open meeting may have a detrimental effect on the litigating position of the board, we may enter into executive session.

42
00:03:07,501 --> 00:03:12,903
So what I'm looking for is a motion to enter executive session.

43
00:03:14,223 --> 00:03:16,924
And Emily, just to confirm, that is your declaration, right?

44
00:03:18,964 --> 00:03:19,244
Yes.

45
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:20,765
Do I not need a motion then?

46
00:03:21,525 --> 00:03:21,845
You do.

47
00:03:22,005 --> 00:03:23,326
No, you just said if the chair declares.

48
00:03:23,366 --> 00:03:24,586
I wanted to make sure you were declaring.

49
00:03:24,967 --> 00:03:26,288
Yes, I am declaring it.

50
00:03:26,308 --> 00:03:27,288
Thank you for confirming that.

51
00:03:27,348 --> 00:03:28,109
I appreciate that.

52
00:03:28,289 --> 00:03:28,669
Thank you.

53
00:03:29,249 --> 00:03:30,250
Yes, you know, you still need a motion.

54
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:31,850
Okay.

55
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:32,611
Looking for a motion.

56
00:03:33,471 --> 00:03:33,811
So moved.

57
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:35,252
Thank you, Peter.

58
00:03:35,712 --> 00:03:36,413
Can we have a second?

59
00:03:42,016 --> 00:03:42,536
I'll second.

60
00:03:43,276 --> 00:03:43,796
Thanks, Ben.

61
00:03:44,077 --> 00:03:45,197
We're going to do a roll call vote.

62
00:03:46,378 --> 00:03:46,958
Peter Calves?

63
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:50,200
Aye.

64
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:51,961
Ari Goffman-Fishman?

65
00:03:52,661 --> 00:03:52,841
Aye.

66
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:54,642
Sabrina Alpino?

67
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:55,515
Aye.

68
00:03:57,077 --> 00:03:57,618
Annie Strang.

69
00:03:59,139 --> 00:03:59,199
Aye.

70
00:04:00,121 --> 00:04:00,741
Ben Lavallee.

71
00:04:01,943 --> 00:04:02,083
Aye.

72
00:04:02,964 --> 00:04:04,485
Myself, Emily Hedeman is an aye.

73
00:04:04,966 --> 00:04:06,768
We're going to be moving into executive session.

74
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:15,138
We will adjourn or we will reconvene once that executive session is closed and get into the rest of the meeting matters.

75
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:21,514
Our executive session discussion is complete.

76
00:04:23,735 --> 00:04:25,897
And I'd like to welcome participants back to the meeting.

77
00:04:25,917 --> 00:04:34,303
Our next agenda item is remaining officer election for the role of clerk.

78
00:04:37,325 --> 00:04:39,407
Does anybody have any questions about what the clerk does?

79
00:04:39,427 --> 00:04:41,909
Any responsibilities there?

80
00:04:42,269 --> 00:04:46,152
Or Danielle, I saw you come off mute if you have insight.

81
00:04:46,172 --> 00:04:46,392
Yeah.

82
00:04:49,129 --> 00:04:59,196
If you look at the rules and regulations of the board, it goes through the, and I put a link to that in the meeting document.

83
00:05:01,417 --> 00:05:03,619
So it's, let me find that now.

84
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:07,121
I have three screens and somehow I never have what I need.

85
00:05:09,763 --> 00:05:11,424
One of those is certifying the minutes.

86
00:05:11,524 --> 00:05:17,188
So sort of like the person who is in charge of reading those,

87
00:05:19,386 --> 00:05:23,747
in more detail in advance.

88
00:05:23,767 --> 00:05:35,952
And also third in line, so the clerk chairs when the vice chair isn't there, or the chair, if the vice chair and chair aren't there, the clerk chairs.

89
00:05:35,972 --> 00:05:41,593
I think those were the main ones.

90
00:05:41,613 --> 00:05:45,895
Some informal ones.

91
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,200
Pardon me?

92
00:05:48,861 --> 00:05:50,342
I said at least the main formal ones.

93
00:05:50,362 --> 00:06:06,233
I mean, I know when I was clerk, I would most, I was kind of put myself in charge of writing notes on the conditions of whatever we were doing to make sure that we had everything straight, but that's not technically a duty per se.

94
00:06:06,253 --> 00:06:07,514
That was just something I was doing.

95
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:08,735
Right.

96
00:06:08,915 --> 00:06:09,095
Yeah.

97
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:13,478
So if in the situation where I, like I,

98
00:06:14,253 --> 00:06:21,316
haven't provided the draft conditions or you want to change them or add them, then yeah, the clerk is kind of like tracking those things.

99
00:06:23,276 --> 00:06:25,597
Yeah, hopefully it's not too heavy a lift.

100
00:06:25,877 --> 00:06:28,018
Staff tries to take more of that on.

101
00:06:28,038 --> 00:06:32,820
And we've kind of floated around that responsibility.

102
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:38,542
Like I know I did some of the draft, some of the conditions updates around Tufts.

103
00:06:40,222 --> 00:06:42,343
And yeah, that's because I couldn't be on that one.

104
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:44,299
Yeah, yeah.

105
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:51,241
So I mean, I feel like the officer positions are very collaborative.

106
00:06:56,703 --> 00:07:04,565
And I'm not sure if Ben, as an associate member, is he eligible to, not that I'm calling you out, Ben.

107
00:07:04,865 --> 00:07:06,186
No, I gotta be honest.

108
00:07:06,246 --> 00:07:07,306
I don't think I can take it on.

109
00:07:07,606 --> 00:07:07,846
OK.

110
00:07:09,427 --> 00:07:10,007
I appreciate that.

111
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:20,446
Um, are there any nominations, either self nominations or peer nominations for clerk?

112
00:07:26,152 --> 00:07:26,913
We can come back to it.

113
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:29,275
Maybe next meeting people think about it.

114
00:07:29,295 --> 00:07:31,838
I think we're good for now.

115
00:07:32,299 --> 00:07:33,780
Okay, cool.

116
00:07:35,062 --> 00:07:36,163
Talk to you guys next time about it.

117
00:07:38,075 --> 00:07:45,417
So moving on to the next agenda item, we have a public hearing related to the Wellington Station Multifamily Overlay District Amendment.

118
00:07:46,177 --> 00:07:50,838
This is a new public hearing, so we're going to read the public hearing notice into the record.

119
00:07:50,858 --> 00:08:02,281
Oh, and actually, before we do that, I would like to put it on the record that Ben Levallee is going to be participating as a full member in the place of

120
00:08:05,557 --> 00:08:08,179
the empty seat that we have on the board.

121
00:08:11,082 --> 00:08:12,163
Yes, okay, great.

122
00:08:14,765 --> 00:08:18,288
So going into the public hearing, I'm going to read the public hearing notice into the record.

123
00:08:18,308 --> 00:08:26,314
The Medford Community Development Board shall conduct a public hearing on Wednesday, March 19, 2025, after 6.30 p.m.

124
00:08:26,654 --> 00:08:29,457
via Zoom remote video conferencing relative to a petition

125
00:08:30,017 --> 00:08:44,540
by Nutter, McClellan & Fish, LLP, representing Transom Real Estate, LLC, to amend the text of the Wellington Station Multifamily Overlay District, known as WSMOD, of the City of Medford Zoning Ordinance as follows.

126
00:08:45,920 --> 00:09:02,503
1.

127
00:08:46,640 --> 00:09:02,503
Amend the Table of Dimensional Standards in Section E to add a footnote to the dimensional table regarding maximum front yard setbacks that would provide for any property subject to a public agency held building restriction that the maximum setbacks shall coincide with that restriction.

128
00:09:02,523 --> 00:09:02,503
2.

129
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:09,445
Amend the Table of Development Incentive Bonuses to change Certified to Certifiable

130
00:09:10,851 --> 00:09:19,494
Three, amend the definition section to add clarifying text to the definition of building coverage to make it clear that it does not include building overhangs.

131
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:25,797
Danielle or Alicia, do you have any introductory comments?

132
00:09:31,979 --> 00:09:32,900
I can say a few things.

133
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:36,261
Basically, this is our multifamily

134
00:09:37,506 --> 00:09:46,630
our MBTA zoning required district that was passed back in December 2023, I think.

135
00:09:47,171 --> 00:09:48,691
Yeah, did it on time.

136
00:09:48,732 --> 00:09:52,193
We're the first batch of municipalities that had to pass this.

137
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:58,236
And so it was a very tight timeframe that we had to do this, because they kept changing it.

138
00:09:59,277 --> 00:10:03,859
And so there were a few things that

139
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:14,493
you know, got missed that were discovered by Attorney Moore and the development team for the site that they're looking at.

140
00:10:14,553 --> 00:10:26,757
So this was like a test fit case where like, oh, did you know that there are these massive easements along these state controlled roads that will make it impossible for us to have these maximum setbacks?

141
00:10:27,717 --> 00:10:29,438
Like, oh, no, we didn't know that.

142
00:10:29,758 --> 00:10:33,019
Because when you're writing zoning under a time crunch, you don't do this

143
00:10:33,638 --> 00:10:37,420
full deed title search kind of thing.

144
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,142
So that was something that we appreciated that they found.

145
00:10:42,883 --> 00:10:51,708
And then some little technicalities when they were testing their proposed dimensions against the ordinance, and will this comply?

146
00:10:51,748 --> 00:10:56,410
And one of those was overhangs, is that part of building coverage?

147
00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:00,272
And then the third is something that we already changed.

148
00:11:00,592 --> 00:11:01,293
It was brought up

149
00:11:02,209 --> 00:11:04,690
the certified versus certifiable.

150
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:15,614
So you all understand why it needs to be certifiable, because the whole timing with LEAD, you can't have something certified in advance.

151
00:11:15,654 --> 00:11:27,238
And also there's other organizations that do similar certifications for lack of better word, meeting those kind of green standards.

152
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:50,416
They, because we're very stretched thin with all of our zoning amendments that we're doing, they went ahead and proposed this amendment, you know, with our support and, you know, it was submitted and it went to the city council who are now, you know, instantly referred it to you.

153
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:55,800
Also, this is the first public hearing and you're making a recommendation with city council and,

154
00:11:58,618 --> 00:12:00,639
as soon as next week it could go to them.

155
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:02,460
Great.

156
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,521
Do you have anything else, Alicia?

157
00:12:06,102 --> 00:12:16,627
I wasn't sure if you were planning to mention it now or later, that we did ask Emily Innes, our zoning consultant, to review this.

158
00:12:17,568 --> 00:12:23,231
And we discussed a small modification to the part about overhangs to limit it.

159
00:12:23,991 --> 00:12:25,832
And I think Danielle has the exact

160
00:12:26,262 --> 00:12:27,363
language we were looking at.

161
00:12:27,403 --> 00:12:29,243
I don't know if that was shared to the board yet.

162
00:12:30,444 --> 00:12:38,187
Just that but otherwise, these changes make complete sense to us and the the certifiable one would have come to you anyhow, eventually.

163
00:12:40,248 --> 00:12:41,829
Yeah, kind of reading it before the meeting.

164
00:12:43,309 --> 00:12:44,150
Everything makes sense.

165
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:51,993
But I would like to hear from Attorney Valerie Moore, who's representing the proponent, Valerie.

166
00:12:55,047 --> 00:12:58,916
Alicia or Danielle are we making attorney more co-host?

167
00:13:06,017 --> 00:13:06,837
You're now a co-host.

168
00:13:06,858 --> 00:13:07,858
You can unmute yourself.

169
00:13:07,978 --> 00:13:08,718
Sorry about that.

170
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:09,799
OK, great.

171
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:10,419
No worries.

172
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,100
Thank you all.

173
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:18,743
I am Valerie Moore from Nutter, McLennan, and Fish, 155 Seaport Boulevard in Boston, for the record.

174
00:13:19,303 --> 00:13:29,808
And I'm here on behalf of Transom Real Estate, LLC, and the underlying property owners, Houlihan Properties, LLC, and Towne Revere Beach Parkway, LLC.

175
00:13:31,028 --> 00:13:46,945
Transom Real Estate is considering the purchase of 10 and 20 Revere Beach Parkway and as part of deciding whether to move forward with that transaction, they started looking deeply at the zoning and figuring out how

176
00:13:47,705 --> 00:13:52,567
to make it work on the site and a couple of issues came to their attention right away.

177
00:13:52,727 --> 00:14:04,893
So resolving this zoning amendment is a threshold question for their ability to move forward with designing a building that they would later propose on the site.

178
00:14:05,993 --> 00:14:09,135
So just to provide the context for the board,

179
00:14:09,935 --> 00:14:25,806
no project is before you and if we do move forward then we would be back in front of you for site plan review for full input on a project and the full opportunity for the board and the public to review it at that time.

180
00:14:26,486 --> 00:14:32,070
So the sole issue in front of the board tonight is a couple of proposed zoning text changes.

181
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:40,137
If I can, if it's all right with you, I'll share my screen and I can put them up on the PowerPoint to walk through them quickly.

182
00:14:40,737 --> 00:14:41,878
Yes, please do Attorney Moore.

183
00:14:48,248 --> 00:14:51,829
So the first one is with respect to building coverage.

184
00:14:52,850 --> 00:15:03,374
We felt that the text wasn't entirely clear as to how a building overhang would be treated when calculating building coverage on the lot.

185
00:15:03,514 --> 00:15:14,338
And so we proposed initially this text in red that excludes building overhangs from this calculation with respect to the footprint of the building.

186
00:15:16,328 --> 00:15:30,281
We are suggesting the additional language that's shown in green here as a limitation on that, as we understand that some questions were raised as to how far somebody could take that.

187
00:15:30,781 --> 00:15:34,665
Would everyone be in front of you with what's effectively a giant mushroom-shaped building?

188
00:15:35,186 --> 00:15:37,288
So to make it clear that that's not

189
00:15:37,968 --> 00:15:48,540
but we think this language would allow, we're suggesting that the board recommend to the city council that they adopt it with this additional limiting language.

190
00:15:49,245 --> 00:15:57,187
that the footprint of the building overhang itself should not exceed 10% of the footprint of the building.

191
00:15:57,267 --> 00:16:01,869
So that would effectively impose a square footage cap on how big an overhang could be.

192
00:16:02,409 --> 00:16:11,451
And this was really important to our client as they consider how to design a building because it allows for more interesting articulation of the facade of the building.

193
00:16:12,152 --> 00:16:16,293
Design is something that's really important to them, so they've paid a lot of attention to this early on.

194
00:16:17,473 --> 00:16:21,536
So that's the first area in which we've sought clarification.

195
00:16:22,957 --> 00:16:39,050
The second is, as you can see from your dimensional table, unlike many zoning districts where you only have a minimum setback, in the Wellington Station Multifamily District, there's also a maximum setback, saying a building can't be further back than 15 feet.

196
00:16:40,806 --> 00:16:50,613
In our case, however, the property is on Revere Beach Parkway, which is owned and under the control of the Department of Conservation and Recreation.

197
00:16:51,394 --> 00:17:05,624
DCR holds a restriction on all properties that are along the parkways that are throughout the surrounding area, under which they impose a 20-foot building setback restriction.

198
00:17:06,785 --> 00:17:24,472
And so we've suggested an additional footnote to the dimensional table that you can see here that would effectively say the maximum setback gets adjusted if you have a state agency held building restriction to coincide with whatever the minimum setback required by the state agency is.

199
00:17:25,012 --> 00:17:26,753
And that's really important because

200
00:17:28,065 --> 00:17:32,388
We wouldn't be able to address this through either a variance or a waiver.

201
00:17:32,408 --> 00:17:39,574
The waiver provisions that are in your bylaw wouldn't allow the board to waive this particular requirement.

202
00:17:40,335 --> 00:17:50,503
And one of the criteria for a variance is that the condition giving rise to the need for the variance can't be found commonly throughout the zoning district.

203
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,704
And in this case, of course.

204
00:17:53,525 --> 00:18:02,651
this restriction is found commonly throughout the zoning district that because it's a state held roadway that largely runs through the middle of it.

205
00:18:02,812 --> 00:18:07,635
So we wouldn't be able to meet that criteria to seek a variance from this requirement.

206
00:18:09,092 --> 00:18:19,548
And finally, we suggest changing certified to certifiable because LEAD is a private agency or private entity.

207
00:18:19,648 --> 00:18:24,255
We don't control when or how they may change their criteria for what

208
00:18:24,796 --> 00:18:28,139
qualifies for LEED Gold or LEED Platinum certification.

209
00:18:28,579 --> 00:18:45,515
So if the building is designed to LEED Gold or LEED Platinum and then construction starts and they change their criteria and we're no longer able to adapt the building to meet whatever the new requirements might be, we wouldn't then be able to have it certified and we may not.

210
00:18:46,175 --> 00:18:48,136
then we'd be in violation of zoning.

211
00:18:48,156 --> 00:18:59,704
So to avoid that, our recommendation is that the language be changed to certifiable as you're already doing with other zoning districts throughout the city.

212
00:19:00,685 --> 00:19:02,686
So those are the three changes.

213
00:19:02,926 --> 00:19:07,570
I'm happy to answer any questions that you might have about them.

214
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:10,972
So that's it for me.

215
00:19:13,634 --> 00:19:13,854
Great.

216
00:19:16,795 --> 00:19:18,796
Thank you for that overview attorney more.

217
00:19:18,856 --> 00:19:19,736
I really appreciate it.

218
00:19:22,577 --> 00:19:28,819
I think everything makes sense to me and I think that it aligns with kind of the overall spirit of the.

219
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:35,202
The district, the overlay district amendment to begin with.

220
00:19:35,262 --> 00:19:38,383
I think it makes it a little bit more understandable, user friendly.

221
00:19:38,403 --> 00:19:46,346
I don't feel like any of these modifications are specifically in in favor of your your client.

222
00:19:47,153 --> 00:19:50,055
I think they're just kind of changes that make sense to everybody.

223
00:19:51,777 --> 00:19:59,983
Thinking about the certifiable, certified thing, you made a comment that, you know, if

224
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:12,149
If it's certifiable at a certain point in time and they change their restrictions, it may not be certifiable anymore.

225
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:20,158
Is there a time element that we need to embed there to say at the point of x, or is that implied?

226
00:20:21,551 --> 00:20:28,196
I think it's implied because in general with zoning, you're looking at compliance at the time that you're applying for your permit.

227
00:20:28,216 --> 00:20:29,116
Okay, great.

228
00:20:29,356 --> 00:20:32,378
In this case where it's a special permit site plan review standard.

229
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:35,881
Okay, so it'd be at the time of special permit application and granting.

230
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:36,141
Okay.

231
00:20:36,161 --> 00:20:37,342
And then the building permit.

232
00:20:37,842 --> 00:20:38,903
Great, that's helpful.

233
00:20:40,804 --> 00:20:41,205
Okay.

234
00:20:46,488 --> 00:20:50,351
So I'd like to open it up to the board for any other questions or comments.

235
00:20:52,024 --> 00:20:53,045
Ben, I see your hand.

236
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:55,747
Thank you, Emily.

237
00:20:55,987 --> 00:21:01,232
I don't have a strong opinion on this, but I'm just curious where the 10% came from on the overhang.

238
00:21:01,252 --> 00:21:04,114
It's just a quick search.

239
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:07,057
That seems like a pretty large amount.

240
00:21:07,477 --> 00:21:12,261
If there's a large building, 10% could actually be a pretty significant size.

241
00:21:13,495 --> 00:21:26,523
Just wanted to throw that question out there if that was deliberately chosen based on some industry standard or see if anybody else on the board has any feelings one way or another.

242
00:21:32,847 --> 00:21:34,708
Are you able to offer any insight there?

243
00:21:35,787 --> 00:21:38,989
So it's not based on a particular industry standard.

244
00:21:39,909 --> 00:21:43,311
Most of the time where we've seen it excluded, there isn't a limitation on it.

245
00:21:44,691 --> 00:21:59,459
Instead, you know, we worked with our architects and started looking at sort of their test cases for what different overhangs for the facade articulation might look like and how those corresponded with the footprint of the building itself.

246
00:22:00,479 --> 00:22:07,442
Um, and so we thought 10% was a reasonable limit on it that would give enough flexibility to have.

247
00:22:08,422 --> 00:22:15,465
In our case, one of the overhangs that they're looking at would cover the, um, sort of pick up drop off area, for example.

248
00:22:16,005 --> 00:22:18,266
So we wanted to allow enough depth for that.

249
00:22:18,326 --> 00:22:28,830
So people can get out of their Ubers, not in the rain, um, while also allowing some flexibility for, um, adding some visual interest to the facade over time.

250
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:29,830
Thank you.

251
00:22:41,168 --> 00:22:43,530
Danielle.

252
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:43,930
Thank you.

253
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:52,337
Through the chair, I did submit this language to Emily Ennis, our zoning consultant.

254
00:22:54,338 --> 00:22:56,580
Just like, what do you think of this language?

255
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,621
Does this make sense?

256
00:22:58,661 --> 00:23:00,103
Do you have any suggestions?

257
00:23:00,203 --> 00:23:06,567
And she didn't flag the 10% as being off, because that was one of the things I was kind of like, you know, picturing it.

258
00:23:06,607 --> 00:23:09,630
So basically like the border of the building,

259
00:23:10,787 --> 00:23:16,408
I guess it's 10% feel right, or that'd be typical.

260
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:20,969
And she didn't flag it as an issue, so.

261
00:23:20,989 --> 00:23:28,591
I don't necessarily have an issue with it.

262
00:23:28,851 --> 00:23:33,152
She did add some additional language, and I put it in the chat, and I can just read it for the record.

263
00:23:33,172 --> 00:23:36,813
Let's see, so in addition, so

264
00:23:39,309 --> 00:23:45,533
building coverage, the maximum area of the lot that can be attributed to the footprint of the building's principal and accessory on that lot.

265
00:23:46,113 --> 00:23:50,636
Building coverage does not include surface parking, is what it says now, correct?

266
00:23:51,317 --> 00:24:01,383
And then to elaborate, building coverage also does not include any portion of the building above the ground floor that overhangs, in parentheses, is cantilevered over such ground floor.

267
00:24:02,124 --> 00:24:05,025
And then what was the 10% language?

268
00:24:05,045 --> 00:24:06,787
Because I don't see that in the,

269
00:24:08,928 --> 00:24:11,169
in our documents for this meeting.

270
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:15,751
This was just something that came in later.

271
00:24:15,771 --> 00:24:25,355
It says, if the overhang cantilever does not exceed 10% of the footprint of the ground floor of the building, then the overhang is not part of the calculation of building coverage.

272
00:24:25,475 --> 00:24:29,517
Overhangs greater than 10% are counted as part of the building coverage.

273
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:33,818
So Emily Innes had just expanded on that language.

274
00:24:37,447 --> 00:24:46,976
As like a stepped calculations, like anything under 10% is not counted, but if it was, you know, 15%, 5% of it would be counted.

275
00:24:46,996 --> 00:24:59,067
How much we're going to really get into this in real life, but I do want to make sure board member is comfortable and satisfied and the rest of the board is.

276
00:25:02,823 --> 00:25:05,486
I'm good for what it's worth.

277
00:25:05,566 --> 00:25:11,591
Yeah, I was just, it was more curiosity and whether that was based on some standard.

278
00:25:12,652 --> 00:25:13,713
Attorney Moore, I see your hand.

279
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,823
I just want to raise a concern with the cantilever language.

280
00:25:18,243 --> 00:25:26,310
Cantilevering refers to a specific way that you would attach it to the building and I don't know that that's how we would propose it.

281
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:31,434
So I would suggest if you choose to use Ms.

282
00:25:31,634 --> 00:25:40,321
Ennis's recommended language modifying that to remove the reference to cantilevering because there are other ways you might engineer it.

283
00:25:41,522 --> 00:25:47,664
Um, it seems to be to me to be slightly beyond the scope of zoning to regulate that within this amendment.

284
00:25:48,764 --> 00:25:49,504
Yeah, that's a good point.

285
00:25:49,544 --> 00:25:50,265
I would agree with that.

286
00:25:53,265 --> 00:25:55,366
Through the chair, I think it would make maybe.

287
00:25:57,907 --> 00:26:00,827
Is overhangs or is cantilever because the same.

288
00:26:01,688 --> 00:26:02,908
Issue would come up, right?

289
00:26:04,721 --> 00:26:10,345
Yeah, but you don't, you don't necessarily support every overhang via cantilevered structure.

290
00:26:11,005 --> 00:26:16,029
Cantilever implies that like you're connecting it at one point and you're kind of counterbalancing.

291
00:26:16,269 --> 00:26:21,252
An overhang could have like supports on the side and not be cantilevered at all.

292
00:26:23,354 --> 00:26:27,617
But whether it should count as part of the ground building coverage, because I think

293
00:26:30,162 --> 00:26:31,363
Can we put this on the screen?

294
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:37,588
I think that might be helpful if we're able to do it live, so we stay aligned.

295
00:26:37,748 --> 00:26:39,650
And I'm happy to describe.

296
00:26:40,531 --> 00:26:42,993
If we had a clerk.

297
00:26:45,595 --> 00:26:48,677
Anybody tempted to try out the rule tonight?

298
00:26:49,838 --> 00:26:50,759
All right, I see your hand.

299
00:26:50,779 --> 00:26:54,642
Oh, you're on.

300
00:26:55,123 --> 00:26:57,024
OK, I'll request to unmute.

301
00:26:58,766 --> 00:26:58,926
Yeah.

302
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:00,560
Thank you.

303
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,101
I couldn't unmute for some reason.

304
00:27:02,942 --> 00:27:06,464
It seems like there's 2 discussions happening.

305
00:27:06,484 --> 00:27:15,209
1 is about kind of saying 10% is fine, but we want it defined as an overhang without limiting to cantilever.

306
00:27:15,249 --> 00:27:18,751
And then there was a discussion of like, do we mess with that 10% and.

307
00:27:22,084 --> 00:27:35,121
I wanted to kind of note that it that's how it seemed to me that there were 2 separate discussions and a question I had is does the attorney for the applicant have any other concerns with.

308
00:27:35,261 --> 00:27:38,025
In a suggested language, other than the word cantilever.

309
00:27:40,955 --> 00:27:46,844
No, I mean, I think what's proposed is effectively the same as the language that I proposed.

310
00:27:47,785 --> 00:27:52,271
It's a little bit lengthier, but it's the same point that they've reached.

311
00:27:53,633 --> 00:27:55,917
So you zoom in, I think.

312
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:12,688
If you were to remove the parenthetical that says is cantilevered over and just two parentheticals, that would solve that concern about how specifically we engineer the overhang.

313
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:18,392
But other than that, I didn't have any concerns with that particular language.

314
00:28:19,112 --> 00:28:20,693
Yeah, those modifications make sense to me.

315
00:28:21,393 --> 00:28:21,593
Yeah.

316
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:30,096
I mean, I wasn't quite following the thread of what Danielle was talking about, but I think what Attorney Moore was talking about was just the use of the word cantilever.

317
00:28:30,436 --> 00:28:30,656
Yes.

318
00:28:30,757 --> 00:28:32,618
Because it refers to a specific engineering thing.

319
00:28:38,363 --> 00:28:38,543
Yeah.

320
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:51,514
And through the chair, Attorney Moore, if something in here

321
00:28:52,283 --> 00:29:00,867
you know, after tonight, since they're advisory making a recommendation, there's another bite at the apple to tweak the words here, wordsmith more.

322
00:29:01,267 --> 00:29:05,649
Once you're at city council, because I know you didn't have a lot of time to look at this.

323
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:09,931
So let me know if you'd like me to stop the share.

324
00:29:16,056 --> 00:29:23,340
It is does do any members of the board have any other comments on this, realizing that we are still going to open it up to to public comment?

325
00:29:24,821 --> 00:29:30,424
And then we'll we'll kind of come back around and be able to make any recommendations based on that.

326
00:29:30,444 --> 00:29:39,329
Alright, seeing none, Danielle, if you can stop screen sharing, thank you for that.

327
00:29:42,465 --> 00:29:45,587
So I am now going to open up public comment period.

328
00:29:46,428 --> 00:29:49,230
Those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature.

329
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:53,172
A little hint on that one, because I know it's sometimes hard to find.

330
00:29:53,612 --> 00:29:58,996
If you're using Zoom on your laptop, React is a heart.

331
00:29:59,336 --> 00:30:02,959
Just click right on the heart, and you'll be able to raise your hand.

332
00:30:04,199 --> 00:30:05,880
You don't need to click the little arrow next to it.

333
00:30:06,461 --> 00:30:07,522
Just click on the heart.

334
00:30:10,191 --> 00:30:14,075
You can also send an email to OCD at medford-ma.gov.

335
00:30:14,875 --> 00:30:17,958
Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.

336
00:30:17,978 --> 00:30:28,248
A reminder to all meeting participants to please refrain from using the chat function to message any comments to the city staff or board members, as it is not part of the public record.

337
00:30:28,768 --> 00:30:35,435
However, if a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, you may message Alicia or Danielle in the chat for assistance.

338
00:30:36,436 --> 00:30:40,859
Each participant will have two minutes to speak, and you will have one opportunity to speak.

339
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:50,508
If you have comments beyond that, I'm happy to, or you're encouraged to email ocdedmedford-ma.gov.

340
00:30:55,012 --> 00:30:57,374
Alicia or Danielle, did we receive any emails?

341
00:30:58,194 --> 00:31:02,418
Before we jump into public comment, did we receive any emails about this agenda item?

342
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:05,330
in advance.

343
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:07,251
I did not see any in our pocket.

344
00:31:07,392 --> 00:31:08,052
Okay, great.

345
00:31:08,172 --> 00:31:10,473
I'm just double checking right now, but I don't see any.

346
00:31:10,954 --> 00:31:11,334
Thank you.

347
00:31:19,139 --> 00:31:22,501
And if any members of the public would like to start raising their hand, feel free.

348
00:31:22,761 --> 00:31:24,002
We'll be opening up the queue shortly.

349
00:31:45,309 --> 00:31:46,149
Alicia, any emails?

350
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:49,111
No, OK, thank you for checking.

351
00:31:49,151 --> 00:31:49,732
I appreciate that.

352
00:31:51,913 --> 00:31:54,314
So if any members of the public have any comments.

353
00:31:56,055 --> 00:31:57,136
Related to.

354
00:31:57,156 --> 00:32:03,159
The Wellington station multifamily overlay district amendment, please raise your hand.

355
00:32:03,179 --> 00:32:07,542
If you're having any technical difficulties, please message Danielle or Alicia.

356
00:32:09,222 --> 00:32:09,903
We'll give it a minute.

357
00:32:47,437 --> 00:32:54,241
Alright, seeing no takers for the public comment, I'm going to go ahead and close the public comment period for this meeting.

358
00:32:54,261 --> 00:33:01,866
I'm going to reopen it to the board to discuss any further revisions to the draft version that was referred out of City Council.

359
00:33:02,827 --> 00:33:06,129
I know we looked at the overhang adjustment.

360
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:10,192
Do we want to make any other recommendations to the others?

361
00:33:18,125 --> 00:33:24,609
And if not, I'm curious if we're ready to vote or if we'd like to continue the public hearing to a date certain.

362
00:33:27,331 --> 00:33:31,854
I think I see no reason why I can't vote on this with the changes as recommended.

363
00:33:31,874 --> 00:33:31,914
OK.

364
00:33:36,037 --> 00:33:46,064
So in that case, I'll make a motion to recommend the proposed zoning amendment to City Council with the changes as noted.

365
00:33:48,497 --> 00:33:48,637
Um.

366
00:33:50,858 --> 00:33:51,278
Thanks, Peter.

367
00:33:51,298 --> 00:33:52,158
We're looking for a second.

368
00:33:53,738 --> 00:33:55,199
I'll second that motion.

369
00:33:55,899 --> 00:33:56,339
Thanks, Annie.

370
00:33:56,359 --> 00:33:57,600
We're gonna do a roll call vote.

371
00:33:58,580 --> 00:33:59,180
Peter Kovs.

372
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:00,220
Aye.

373
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:01,961
Ari Goffman-Fishman.

374
00:34:05,442 --> 00:34:06,462
I'll ask you to unmute.

375
00:34:08,561 --> 00:34:09,221
There you go.

376
00:34:09,241 --> 00:34:15,384
Uh, yes, Alicia, if you can read me as host, but yes, I or just leave yourself unmuted, you know, okay, I can do that.

377
00:34:16,604 --> 00:34:16,824
Thanks.

378
00:34:16,844 --> 00:34:17,205
Sorry.

379
00:34:17,505 --> 00:34:18,385
Sabrina Alpino.

380
00:34:18,405 --> 00:34:20,726
All right.

381
00:34:20,766 --> 00:34:21,406
Ben LaVallee.

382
00:34:23,507 --> 00:34:23,547
Hi.

383
00:34:24,207 --> 00:34:24,788
Annie Strang.

384
00:34:25,568 --> 00:34:25,608
Hi.

385
00:34:27,101 --> 00:34:32,085
And I am Leigh Henneman, I'm also an I. So the motion passes.

386
00:34:33,325 --> 00:34:38,809
Thank you to Attorney Moore for your time and best of luck with the city council.

387
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:40,530
Thank you all.

388
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:47,715
I really appreciate all of your time tonight and I look forward to being back in front of you shortly with a site plan approval application.

389
00:34:48,115 --> 00:34:48,756
Thank you.

390
00:34:48,876 --> 00:34:49,596
Looking forward to it.

391
00:34:49,957 --> 00:34:50,197
Thank you.

392
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:55,812
So the next agenda item we have is minutes.

393
00:34:56,713 --> 00:35:02,596
Unfortunately, it looks like staff didn't have a chance to edit those, so we're going to table those until the next meeting.

394
00:35:03,176 --> 00:35:06,318
Danielle or Alicia, do we need to motion to continue them or no?

395
00:35:06,418 --> 00:35:08,660
OK, never sure.

396
00:35:10,701 --> 00:35:12,902
Our next agenda item is zoning updates.

397
00:35:14,663 --> 00:35:17,605
Danielle, do you have any, or Alicia, do you have any updates there?

398
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:26,496
So I did advertise the public hearing for the neighborhood residential and urban residential zoning districts.

399
00:35:28,397 --> 00:35:33,681
So that will be the first public hearing will be scheduled for April 2nd.

400
00:35:36,003 --> 00:35:46,431
And we have it tentatively, well, it's in the public hearing notice, but it's pending your recommendation if it's ready in time for April 29th, it would go to city council.

401
00:35:47,763 --> 00:35:48,443
Very exciting.

402
00:35:49,084 --> 00:35:56,347
I know with the recent Salem Street corridor work we did, we have a lot of public involvement, so I'm hoping to have the same.

403
00:35:56,367 --> 00:36:00,789
So yeah, very much looking forward to those items.

404
00:36:01,029 --> 00:36:01,570
Yep, Alicia.

405
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:13,515
In that vein, we've actually scheduled a Q&A for it, a public Q&A for next Thursday, the 27th, to have it be in advance of your first public hearing.

406
00:36:13,855 --> 00:36:14,476
That is wonderful.

407
00:36:14,496 --> 00:36:15,996
With the hopes that that would work better.

408
00:36:18,622 --> 00:36:35,826
I have to admit that as I was saying that, I realized that we scheduled it, we booked the room, and I was supposed to receive a flyer to circulate, and I'm gonna reach back out because I don't think that I have received that, but it is scheduled for Thursday the 27th here in City Hall.

409
00:36:36,446 --> 00:36:36,666
Great.

410
00:36:37,386 --> 00:36:41,207
I encourage members of the board to spread that throughout their networks as well.

411
00:36:43,007 --> 00:36:45,428
We wanna get as much comment as early as possible.

412
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:48,900
Great.

413
00:36:49,561 --> 00:36:50,602
Any other zoning updates?

414
00:36:54,405 --> 00:37:14,862
In the planning and permitting committee level, which is like the, you know, we're putting together the amendments, um, updating, uh, ADUs to take into account the protected use ADUs that are now, uh, state law and also, um, looking at the more of the commercial quarters and squares.

415
00:37:15,683 --> 00:37:15,863
So,

416
00:37:17,302 --> 00:37:24,169
I think that'll take another meeting or at least one more meeting for them to report something out.

417
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:30,875
And then that will be coming to you all in May.

418
00:37:34,739 --> 00:37:35,100
I believe.

419
00:37:38,242 --> 00:37:44,963
I just wanted to make sure everybody was aware and has seen that the zoning webpage has been dramatically updated.

420
00:37:46,184 --> 00:37:50,605
So it's hopefully more useful this way with a lot of information for the public.

421
00:37:50,625 --> 00:37:53,065
It's medfordma.org slash zoning.

422
00:37:53,945 --> 00:37:55,686
Feel free to share that out to people.

423
00:37:55,786 --> 00:38:05,528
And if you see things that you find to be confusing, please, please tell us because if you're confused, oh my word, the public and we'll get changes made to it.

424
00:38:05,548 --> 00:38:05,588
So.

425
00:38:08,183 --> 00:38:09,164
Yeah, very well said.

426
00:38:11,045 --> 00:38:11,306
Great.

427
00:38:12,907 --> 00:38:15,710
I don't have any other items on the agenda.

428
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:24,057
Just for clarification on that, when is the residential zoning coming before us?

429
00:38:24,177 --> 00:38:25,458
Is that the second?

430
00:38:26,359 --> 00:38:26,899
April 2nd.

431
00:38:27,299 --> 00:38:27,660
Okay, great.

432
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:29,662
Just wanted to confirm the date on that.

433
00:38:30,122 --> 00:38:30,322
Thanks.

434
00:38:30,342 --> 00:38:33,985
For our next meeting.

435
00:38:37,329 --> 00:38:37,549
Great.

436
00:38:37,929 --> 00:38:43,131
So with no other items on the agenda, I will be looking for a motion to adjourn.

437
00:38:47,893 --> 00:38:48,373
So moved.

438
00:38:49,313 --> 00:38:51,074
I was going to request you to unmute, Ari.

439
00:38:52,254 --> 00:38:53,754
I'm looking for a second, please.

440
00:38:54,835 --> 00:38:56,135
I'll second that motion.

441
00:38:56,816 --> 00:38:57,396
Thank you, Annie.

442
00:38:57,456 --> 00:38:58,696
We're going to do a roll call vote.

443
00:38:59,636 --> 00:39:00,277
Peter Calves?

444
00:39:02,838 --> 00:39:02,958
Aye.

445
00:39:03,898 --> 00:39:04,758
Ari Goffman-Fishman?

446
00:39:05,498 --> 00:39:05,638
Aye.

447
00:39:06,339 --> 00:39:07,079
Sabrina Alpino?

448
00:39:07,835 --> 00:39:07,955
Aye.

449
00:39:08,757 --> 00:39:09,337
Annie Strang.

450
00:39:10,038 --> 00:39:10,199
Aye.

451
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:11,761
Ben LaValle.

452
00:39:13,023 --> 00:39:13,163
Aye.

453
00:39:14,245 --> 00:39:16,588
And I, Emily Hedeman, am also an aye.

454
00:39:17,289 --> 00:39:18,571
With that, our meeting is adjourned.

455
00:39:19,172 --> 00:39:24,881
As always, thank you to Danielle and Alicia for all of your hard work preparing for this meeting and supporting us throughout it.

456
00:39:25,622 --> 00:39:26,663
Could not do it without you.

457
00:39:26,683 --> 00:39:29,127
And hope everybody has a wonderful evening.

458
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:30,108
Yeah.

459
00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:30,950
You as well.

460
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:31,450
Bye.

461
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:32,452
Nice early night.
