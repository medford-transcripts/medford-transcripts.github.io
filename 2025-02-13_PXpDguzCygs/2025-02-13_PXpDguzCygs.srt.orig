[SPEAKER_07]: Here's a co-host.

30
00:14:25,845 --> 00:14:35,968
[SPEAKER_15]: The action discussion item for this committee meeting is, as usual, paper 24-033, zoning ordinance updates with the Innis Associates team.

31
00:14:37,048 --> 00:14:41,669
[SPEAKER_15]: This is our third committee meeting on the neighborhood and urban residential

32
00:14:42,429 --> 00:14:42,809
[SPEAKER_15]: topic.

33
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:46,771
[SPEAKER_15]: We were introduced to this topic on January 15th.

34
00:14:46,831 --> 00:14:56,635
[SPEAKER_15]: We got our first look at kind of a jumping off point proposal, um, around new categories for the residential areas of the city.

35
00:14:56,675 --> 00:14:59,376
[SPEAKER_15]: We had some first impressions, questions, suggestions.

36
00:14:59,456 --> 00:15:05,959
[SPEAKER_15]: Two weeks ago, we saw an updated draft from our zoning consultant and associates.

37
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,420
[SPEAKER_15]: Some of the boundaries had moved around.

38
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,961
[SPEAKER_15]: We were able to get a little bit more in depth

39
00:15:10,782 --> 00:15:16,508
[SPEAKER_15]: On the differences between the various sub districts and counselors also made a number of requests suggestions.

40
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:28,622
[SPEAKER_15]: On places where the boundaries between the various sub districts should move around to better accommodate the topography the geography, the types of residential types that are already existing in the various neighborhoods around Medford.

41
00:15:29,463 --> 00:15:40,295
[SPEAKER_15]: So tonight being our third meeting on this topic, we have another amended proposal in front of us that I understand incorporates all of the questions and requests that were made over the past couple meetings.

42
00:15:40,855 --> 00:15:47,823
[SPEAKER_15]: We're seeing for the first time kind of more specificity on the urban residential sub-districts under this topic.

43
00:15:47,963 --> 00:15:49,105
[SPEAKER_15]: And just to quickly recap,

44
00:15:50,005 --> 00:15:54,327
[SPEAKER_15]: the neighborhood residential sub districts and the urban residential sub districts.

45
00:15:54,827 --> 00:16:13,893
[SPEAKER_15]: These propose five new ways of categorizing existing residential districts throughout the community, creating a more modernized and more thoughtful gradient from our lowest density areas, residential areas of the city, up to our highest density residential areas of the city.

46
00:16:13,913 --> 00:16:15,374
[SPEAKER_15]: And this is informed by, you know,

47
00:16:16,755 --> 00:16:32,125
[SPEAKER_15]: Topography, geography, what the land allows, what the streets allow, the types of houses and homes that are already built around the community, and proximity to things that encourage greater density, such as transit, places where there are many jobs concentrated together.

48
00:16:33,486 --> 00:16:52,861
[SPEAKER_15]: So I understand that tonight we have a couple, a number of new diagrams to look at and respond to, new proposals for boundaries between the various neighborhood residential sub-districts and urban residential sub-districts, as well as a new map that superimposes the new sub-districts on top of existing residential types in Medford.

49
00:16:52,901 --> 00:16:55,623
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think this is reflecting some of the requests that councilors made

50
00:16:56,123 --> 00:17:06,953
[SPEAKER_15]: two weeks ago asking for some areas that were, for example, Neighborhood Residential 2 to become Neighborhood Residential 1 again to reflect existing neighborhood character suggestions of that nature.

51
00:17:07,014 --> 00:17:16,743
[SPEAKER_15]: So unless there are any initial comments from city staff or counselors, I'll first turn it over to NS Associates for a presentation as usual, and then we can discuss.

52
00:17:21,751 --> 00:17:28,507
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, seeing none, I will turn it over to NS Associates whenever you are ready.

53
00:17:34,232 --> 00:17:35,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

54
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:40,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening everyone Emily and us from NS Associates and I'm here with power almost Martinez.

55
00:17:41,235 --> 00:17:46,537
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually going to turn it over to power so you can see the work that we've done since the last meeting.

56
00:17:47,637 --> 00:17:55,440
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after the presentation or even during if you have specific questions, or we're happy to address any comments or concerns you may have.

57
00:17:59,153 --> 00:18:00,014
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

58
00:18:01,255 --> 00:18:02,656
[SPEAKER_01]: If I may, Madam Chair.

59
00:18:04,477 --> 00:18:21,812
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this, today we are going to go also through the process timeline, the plan 2025, the opportunity when those public comments can be done, some introduction analysis, and then the different versions that we have done for this proposal until the last one.

60
00:18:23,052 --> 00:18:30,254
[SPEAKER_01]: that we also added this time the urban residential into our proposal and making a bit of more specific.

61
00:18:30,314 --> 00:18:31,134
[SPEAKER_01]: What does that mean?

62
00:18:31,154 --> 00:18:44,237
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go quite fast in the things that we are repeating from the others, but if anyone has any comment or question on that, obviously we are happy to answer.

63
00:18:45,818 --> 00:18:53,204
[SPEAKER_01]: So just for the timeline, today we are in the second part of that neighborhood and urban residential.

64
00:18:53,684 --> 00:18:56,567
[SPEAKER_01]: We are looking today at more that urban part.

65
00:18:57,588 --> 00:19:05,714
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are amending that neighborhood residential with the last comments from the planning meeting that we had in January 29th.

66
00:19:07,978 --> 00:19:15,677
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we are proposing what type of residential buildings should go into our urban areas.

67
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,201
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we will also have the CDB.

68
00:19:20,601 --> 00:19:24,642
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so we did last in the 5th of February.

69
00:19:24,682 --> 00:19:29,783
[SPEAKER_01]: We did the green score, um, which was referring out back to the City Council.

70
00:19:30,643 --> 00:19:35,865
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we will look into Salem Street again in March the 5th.

71
00:19:36,765 --> 00:19:44,867
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we will look into also whenever we pass this, the residential districts and then may the commercial and mixed districts.

72
00:19:46,302 --> 00:19:48,923
[SPEAKER_01]: We also had a public meeting.

73
00:19:48,963 --> 00:20:09,892
[SPEAKER_01]: We had one this Monday, February 10th about Salem Street, and we will bring as well some public meetings for the residential, this topic before it goes to CDB in February or March, and then for the squares as well in March, April.

74
00:20:11,172 --> 00:20:14,894
[SPEAKER_01]: We will determine better these dates, and we will obviously let you know.

75
00:20:17,096 --> 00:20:20,018
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some video and topics that we will do for the discussion.

76
00:20:20,038 --> 00:20:34,870
[SPEAKER_01]: We are working on video one and two about the zoning update, what are we doing, and then more into the Salem Street uses, and then the Salem Street height, Salem Street high bed building massing.

77
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:38,752
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then the video five about green score.

78
00:20:38,772 --> 00:20:40,133
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are we are working on them.

79
00:20:40,493 --> 00:20:41,754
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we will bring as well.

80
00:20:42,534 --> 00:20:45,196
[SPEAKER_01]: Some for the neighborhood districts and uses.

81
00:20:45,276 --> 00:20:50,559
[SPEAKER_01]: They mentioned this commercial notes, commercial districts, um, as well as uses.

82
00:20:50,579 --> 00:21:00,865
[SPEAKER_01]: They mentioned and then transportation demand management parking, which are big topics that we think all of this needs some video so that people can get, um, a more

83
00:21:01,565 --> 00:21:02,366
[SPEAKER_01]: the larger picture of what we are.

84
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:05,908
[SPEAKER_01]: Broad view or the bigger picture of what we are talking about.

85
00:21:05,928 --> 00:21:12,453
[SPEAKER_01]: Um then the plan 2025 just very briefly January.

86
00:21:12,493 --> 00:21:14,814
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing the we didn't neighborhood residential.

87
00:21:14,894 --> 00:21:21,999
[SPEAKER_01]: February is more the urban residential March commercial framework and then the Medford Square, April West Medford and other

88
00:21:26,382 --> 00:21:29,925
[SPEAKER_01]: We had also some citywide topics that we would be discussing.

89
00:21:30,405 --> 00:21:31,386
[SPEAKER_01]: January was housing.

90
00:21:31,426 --> 00:21:34,769
[SPEAKER_01]: In February, we'll introduce ADU and neighborhood notes.

91
00:21:35,749 --> 00:21:39,392
[SPEAKER_01]: Then in March will be community solar and nonconforming use and structure.

92
00:21:39,873 --> 00:21:43,035
[SPEAKER_01]: April, transport demand management and site plan review.

93
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:45,537
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in May, the parking requirement.

94
00:21:48,018 --> 00:22:05,063
[SPEAKER_01]: So when are the opportunities for public comments we have what we are doing here today in city council in the planning permitting committee meeting, we present a topic, or we just continue to discuss this topic, then at some point with that topic is ready enough.

95
00:22:06,663 --> 00:22:21,706
[SPEAKER_01]: refer from the City Council towards the CDB then the CDB will listen to the topic and vote as well on that with any recommendations and then it will be referred back to City Council and voted there and then finally being approved.

96
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:28,612
[SPEAKER_01]: So all these four stages, and that usually we have more in there in the beginning because we come back with a topic.

97
00:22:30,794 --> 00:22:41,723
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone from the public can introduce can comment on these on any of these issues that they want to, or they are, yeah, they want to refer.

98
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:48,693
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have already done some in the City Council.

99
00:22:48,793 --> 00:22:53,396
[SPEAKER_01]: We presented the Salem Street, Mystic Avenue, Green Score, and neighborhood residential.

100
00:22:53,476 --> 00:22:56,398
[SPEAKER_01]: Today we are presenting the most urban residential.

101
00:22:57,779 --> 00:23:02,583
[SPEAKER_01]: The Mystic Avenue was already referred, Salem Street as well, and Green Score.

102
00:23:03,143 --> 00:23:05,605
[SPEAKER_01]: in the CDB was presented Salem Street.

103
00:23:06,005 --> 00:23:16,431
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the public meeting and we will have again another presentation of the Salem Street on the 5th of March.

104
00:23:18,453 --> 00:23:26,858
[SPEAKER_01]: Green score was already referred as I said and then we will have again these topics being referred again to City Council.

105
00:23:28,394 --> 00:23:33,249
[SPEAKER_01]: So any dates that we know and we are, will be updated as well in here.

106
00:23:35,127 --> 00:23:36,127
[SPEAKER_01]: So where do we come from?

107
00:23:36,147 --> 00:23:43,249
[SPEAKER_01]: In January, 2023, Medford published their comprehensive plan.

108
00:23:44,149 --> 00:23:55,131
[SPEAKER_01]: And in there, there are all these topics that were identified through intense public meetings and engagement with the citizens.

109
00:23:55,291 --> 00:23:56,312
[SPEAKER_01]: This was citywide.

110
00:23:56,732 --> 00:24:02,033
[SPEAKER_01]: And there were some opportunities and topics that were identified.

111
00:24:03,433 --> 00:24:07,936
[SPEAKER_01]: and they were done in these strategies of objectives and goals.

112
00:24:08,357 --> 00:24:15,081
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we are doing here is implementing the part of zoning that refers to the comprehensive plan.

113
00:24:15,421 --> 00:24:22,866
[SPEAKER_01]: So here are some of those that address the issues that we will be talking about.

114
00:24:24,807 --> 00:24:34,471
[SPEAKER_01]: This was the plan that was done from the comprehensive that was that comes from the comprehensive plan is the vision, and we will be talking about all these areas of the quarters.

115
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:48,017
[SPEAKER_01]: The residential the squares, some transformational areas, commercial nodes so all of these topics, we will be talking, we already addressed the mystic Avenue quarter, the original quarter.

116
00:24:48,757 --> 00:24:51,178
[SPEAKER_01]: We are working on Salem Street.

117
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:58,499
[SPEAKER_01]: And now at this point, this meeting, we are addressing all the residential neighborhoods.

118
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:09,602
[SPEAKER_01]: We will continue with, as I said, with other regional corridors, with the squares, and other citywide topics.

119
00:25:10,382 --> 00:25:12,503
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is the map that we use as the vision.

120
00:25:14,538 --> 00:25:21,401
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's your current zoning.

121
00:25:21,461 --> 00:25:28,404
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we do now is using all these maps that are analyzed in certain topics.

122
00:25:28,464 --> 00:25:30,926
[SPEAKER_01]: This, for example, is about all the transportation modes.

123
00:25:32,506 --> 00:25:37,088
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we have the non-exclusively residential neighborhoods.

124
00:25:37,128 --> 00:25:42,531
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are more commercial or mixed-use areas.

125
00:25:44,773 --> 00:25:50,218
[SPEAKER_01]: we identify them as the quarters, squares, institutional or certain special districts.

126
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:59,326
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all the building types for the residential that are in Medford.

127
00:25:59,346 --> 00:26:04,911
[SPEAKER_01]: So all identified as single family or duplex or three units.

128
00:26:06,573 --> 00:26:07,834
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have that information.

129
00:26:08,354 --> 00:26:16,481
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of this and others we consider to build the new residential proposals that we are bringing here today.

130
00:26:17,501 --> 00:26:32,193
[SPEAKER_01]: So what factors are we considering is the proximity to high frequent and efficient public transit, proximity to higher job density areas, lot sizes and topography, existing residential types, transition between low and medium density areas,

131
00:26:32,513 --> 00:26:40,818
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of these factors are playing a role in the decisions of where these new residential neighborhoods go.

132
00:26:42,639 --> 00:26:45,620
[SPEAKER_01]: So this I'm going to go fast because this was version one.

133
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,401
[SPEAKER_01]: We brought this as a version one.

134
00:26:47,521 --> 00:26:51,904
[SPEAKER_01]: This got amended to go into a lower density, which we did.

135
00:26:51,964 --> 00:26:59,628
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we compare these to the existing types, we're actually down zoning some of the existing areas.

136
00:27:00,028 --> 00:27:03,370
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did another proposal, and that's the version two.

137
00:27:03,891 --> 00:27:09,554
[SPEAKER_01]: There were some comments, and that's where we bring the version three.

138
00:27:09,674 --> 00:27:14,157
[SPEAKER_01]: So here only with the neighborhood residential one, two, and three.

139
00:27:14,838 --> 00:27:19,541
[SPEAKER_01]: This means neighborhood residential one is single unit dwelling plus ADU.

140
00:27:20,101 --> 00:27:22,663
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we have historic conversion up to two units.

141
00:27:23,363 --> 00:27:40,050
[SPEAKER_01]: Red neighborhood residential to a single dwelling plus at you to unit dwelling and historic conversion to three units and neighborhood residential three single unit dwelling plus at you to three unit dwelling townhouse and historic conversion

142
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:42,791
[SPEAKER_01]: from 2 to 4 units.

143
00:27:43,431 --> 00:27:45,852
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, this should be from 2 to 4 units.

144
00:27:47,973 --> 00:27:56,756
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are the changes that we made to the previous one was in West Medford, we did that transition from 3, 2 to 1.

145
00:27:56,896 --> 00:28:01,538
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the northern area, we'll see one neighborhood residential one.

146
00:28:02,978 --> 00:28:20,611
[SPEAKER_01]: Then up in Lawrence States on the east area up of Medford Square, it was for neighborhood residential three, and now it's neighborhood residential two, as well as one little square that was also there a bit south.

147
00:28:22,832 --> 00:28:24,413
[SPEAKER_01]: So those were changed as well.

148
00:28:24,773 --> 00:28:33,358
[SPEAKER_01]: Hillside on the other side of Boston Avenue, there were some division between neighborhood three and two.

149
00:28:33,818 --> 00:28:41,622
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they are both neighborhood residential three because what we saw is that it's very similar in the typologies that are there.

150
00:28:43,603 --> 00:28:47,946
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that is all of the changes that we've done.

151
00:28:49,763 --> 00:28:56,425
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and we are proposing the different difference between urban residential one and two.

152
00:28:57,325 --> 00:29:02,966
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the urban residential one is to dwelling unit historic conversion 2 to 5.

153
00:29:04,126 --> 00:29:11,068
[SPEAKER_01]: Townhouse three unit dwelling and then multiplex, and this is allowing for four up to six units.

154
00:29:11,888 --> 00:29:26,363
[SPEAKER_01]: Urban residential two is townhouse three unit dwelling multiplex four to six and then multiple unit dwelling plus six units that is basically only up to three stories high.

155
00:29:26,824 --> 00:29:27,905
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the maximum height.

156
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:55,028
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything that goes higher than that, what we recommend is to not have it as an exclusive residential district, but to have a mixed use so that when you have that much higher density of residential, we recommend to also include some commercial, retail, some other uses so that it can provide for that residential density.

157
00:29:55,988 --> 00:29:58,349
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why you will see there a mixed use.

158
00:29:58,489 --> 00:30:10,032
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this area, what we have found is that a lot of these more urban areas that have bigger developments, they don't go higher than three stories.

159
00:30:10,153 --> 00:30:20,956
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why we have all of them in these urban residential too, except for this area of Riverside on the south that they are go higher than that.

160
00:30:21,076 --> 00:30:24,437
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why we propose that as a mixed use instead of

161
00:30:25,117 --> 00:30:26,538
[SPEAKER_01]: another urban residential.

162
00:30:28,999 --> 00:30:31,960
[SPEAKER_01]: And here we have the same as we did for the others.

163
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:38,962
[SPEAKER_01]: We just, these new districts we put on, we lay over the building types residential.

164
00:30:39,222 --> 00:30:44,804
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's easier to see what is there now and what is coming or what is being sewn up to.

165
00:30:47,325 --> 00:30:54,068
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you think this will be a good place to stop and then that we can get some comments from all of you.

166
00:30:59,811 --> 00:30:59,991
[SPEAKER_15]: great.

167
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:01,732
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you so much for that overview.

168
00:31:01,752 --> 00:31:08,437
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, we'll go first to questions and comments from counselors.

169
00:31:09,678 --> 00:31:11,219
[SPEAKER_15]: I see Councilor Scarpelli.

170
00:31:11,419 --> 00:31:11,699
[SPEAKER_15]: Go ahead.

171
00:31:13,681 --> 00:31:15,402
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, thank you, Madam Chair.

172
00:31:15,442 --> 00:31:15,662
[SPEAKER_06]: I think

173
00:31:16,413 --> 00:31:17,474
[SPEAKER_06]: My question is just general.

174
00:31:18,135 --> 00:31:35,689
[SPEAKER_06]: As we're seeing this, some questions about one, I know that it looks like I think Councilor Lemming shared the information to the public on the page so they can share that, because I'm getting texts that people couldn't find this.

175
00:31:35,749 --> 00:31:40,633
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the other question I have is, is it possible, Madam Chair, to work with NSF

176
00:31:41,373 --> 00:31:49,926
[SPEAKER_06]: With with the residents trying to understand the process, I know we talked about this yesterday and making things a little bit streamlined.

177
00:31:49,946 --> 00:31:51,509
[SPEAKER_06]: So people can understand it better.

178
00:31:52,029 --> 00:31:55,835
[SPEAKER_06]: I think 1 of the concerns right now is that the color of the, the, the.

179
00:31:56,767 --> 00:32:06,553
[SPEAKER_06]: distinctions between the different urban, uh, residential urban, um, you know, the, to separate them, it's yellow on yellow and orange.

180
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:09,554
[SPEAKER_06]: So is there a way to help that later as we move forward?

181
00:32:09,574 --> 00:32:13,296
[SPEAKER_06]: Just for, just for clarification purpose, so people can understand this a little bit better.

182
00:32:13,977 --> 00:32:16,118
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, that's all I have, but thank you.

183
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,261
[SPEAKER_15]: Great, thank you so much, Councilor Scarpelli.

184
00:32:19,401 --> 00:32:24,805
[SPEAKER_15]: And yes, I see that Councilor Lemming shared meeting files through the City Council's public portal in the chat.

185
00:32:25,965 --> 00:32:27,186
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for doing that, Councilor Lemming.

186
00:32:28,767 --> 00:32:31,069
[SPEAKER_06]: And- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

187
00:32:31,089 --> 00:32:34,951
[SPEAKER_06]: Could we, I just had a resident just text me, Madam Chair.

188
00:32:35,812 --> 00:32:43,376
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe if Councilor Lemming can share the ones that were sent today, because I think that, I don't know, I haven't looked at it, but some of the questions that might be,

189
00:32:44,617 --> 00:32:47,779
[SPEAKER_06]: The ones shared from an older slides.

190
00:32:48,439 --> 00:32:50,080
[SPEAKER_06]: So, if we can just look at that, that'd be helpful.

191
00:32:51,181 --> 00:32:51,501
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

192
00:32:52,601 --> 00:32:53,022
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, great.

193
00:32:53,062 --> 00:32:53,682
[SPEAKER_15]: We will double check.

194
00:32:58,277 --> 00:32:58,738
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, great.

195
00:32:58,778 --> 00:32:59,098
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

196
00:32:59,158 --> 00:33:03,562
[SPEAKER_15]: We will double check that it's possible that the wrong files were updated to the public portal for today.

197
00:33:03,743 --> 00:33:04,343
[SPEAKER_15]: My apologies.

198
00:33:04,363 --> 00:33:11,470
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll make sure that they are updated ASAP after the meeting and they will match what's on the screen so that folks can, you know, zoom in.

199
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:12,852
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

200
00:33:13,252 --> 00:33:14,653
[SPEAKER_15]: Investigate them on their own time.

201
00:33:14,693 --> 00:33:15,775
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councillor Scarpelli.

202
00:33:15,835 --> 00:33:21,020
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'll go to NS Associates for a direct response related to the colors on the maps.

203
00:33:24,032 --> 00:33:38,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, thank you very much Madam Chair we are we are sympathetic to the color differences we're happy to look at how we can further differentiate them I will just note that we're using the standard kind of planning land use colors of yellow for residential.

204
00:33:39,163 --> 00:33:49,329
[SPEAKER_02]: There are only so many gradations of yellow that don't start to blur into each other so we certainly appreciate the counselors comment comments on this and we'll see what we can do to better differentiate it.

205
00:33:49,789 --> 00:34:01,055
[SPEAKER_02]: It may be for the purposes of our discussion here we can we can vary from the plant the standard planning colors for land use and get a bit better better variation, so thank you for the comment.

206
00:34:01,595 --> 00:34:04,017
[SPEAKER_06]: Just wanted to share what we're hearing so I appreciate you.

207
00:34:04,037 --> 00:34:04,337
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

208
00:34:05,855 --> 00:34:05,995
[SPEAKER_15]: great.

209
00:34:06,175 --> 00:34:06,896
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Scarpellian.

210
00:34:06,936 --> 00:34:07,376
[SPEAKER_15]: Absolutely.

211
00:34:07,456 --> 00:34:17,282
[SPEAKER_15]: We want to make sure that the maps are easy to read, so we'll work together to find a solution on that so that the colors are easily differentiatable.

212
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:30,510
[SPEAKER_15]: And on the other note about wanting these proposals to be easily legible for residents, whether they're tuning into these meetings or catching up after the fact, we had a great discussion about this last night.

213
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:31,051
[SPEAKER_15]: We are

214
00:34:31,571 --> 00:34:53,724
[SPEAKER_15]: working really hard to overhaul, you know, or to onboard a couple new tools, including a pretty major overhaul to the city's zoning website, which will have kind of the very, very short elevator pitch version of all of these proposals, so that folks can get oriented to what we're talking about ahead of these meetings and just have an easier on ramp to discussing this work in progress.

215
00:34:54,304 --> 00:34:55,365
[SPEAKER_15]: Go next to President Behrs.

216
00:34:58,457 --> 00:34:59,818
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

217
00:35:00,058 --> 00:35:10,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Just wanted to thank you guys for continuing to update these early maps based on the conversations that we've been having.

218
00:35:12,968 --> 00:35:19,614
[SPEAKER_03]: I know a next step is going to be looking at the dimensional requirements.

219
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:27,260
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just wanted to be clear here, all of the residential districts, we're talking about a three-story maximum height.

220
00:35:28,058 --> 00:35:30,460
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so we're not going over three stories anywhere.

221
00:35:32,902 --> 00:35:40,227
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you had any initial thoughts into the dimensional requirements?

222
00:35:40,287 --> 00:35:42,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that something we're probably going to see at the next meeting?

223
00:35:42,269 --> 00:35:43,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

224
00:35:45,211 --> 00:35:49,995
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think in general, I appreciate the changes that have been made.

225
00:35:50,055 --> 00:35:53,818
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, you know, this NR2 district north of the square

226
00:35:55,385 --> 00:36:01,730
[SPEAKER_03]: was something we talked about, and I think it just better, it's more cohesive and kind of better describes the topography of the area.

227
00:36:05,192 --> 00:36:20,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than that, my only question was about this mixed-use two district, or potential mixed-use district, and that looks like it's at the Mystic Place Towers, essentially, and it's the idea there just that

228
00:36:22,218 --> 00:36:36,483
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm guessing we're not going to see a significant redevelopment of that in any reasonable period of time, but is the idea just that we don't want to put that in an urban residential too because it would be non-conforming because the structures are so tall?

229
00:36:37,803 --> 00:36:38,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thank you.

230
00:36:41,124 --> 00:36:42,925
[SPEAKER_03]: And then just basically everything else that's

231
00:36:44,383 --> 00:36:49,128
[SPEAKER_03]: of that kind of height and scope fall into the mixed-use corridors and square districts?

232
00:36:50,189 --> 00:36:51,110
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that's a yes.

233
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:56,015
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just... Got it.

234
00:36:57,016 --> 00:36:59,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Kit, if you could... Sorry.

235
00:37:02,105 --> 00:37:03,606
[SPEAKER_01]: to clarify for everyone.

236
00:37:03,906 --> 00:37:06,307
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, everything that you said is is correct.

237
00:37:06,367 --> 00:37:10,430
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of this higher are going to be in the corridors or in the squares.

238
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:17,513
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we will examine those will which which we think yes, it will go into mix in some kind of mixed use.

239
00:37:18,674 --> 00:37:19,454
[SPEAKER_01]: For the riverside.

240
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:23,236
[SPEAKER_01]: We we are aware that right now there is already a development.

241
00:37:23,957 --> 00:37:25,758
[SPEAKER_01]: Um and it's more for the future.

242
00:37:26,178 --> 00:37:27,338
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what that could be.

243
00:37:29,219 --> 00:37:33,340
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we do it as an urban residential too, as you said, we'll be non-conforming.

244
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:34,480
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

245
00:37:35,561 --> 00:37:45,423
[SPEAKER_03]: And then my only other kind of very minor question is around on South Street.

246
00:37:47,764 --> 00:37:49,224
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a number of parcels.

247
00:37:51,424 --> 00:37:53,485
[SPEAKER_03]: You see kind of this urban residential

248
00:37:54,962 --> 00:38:03,345
[SPEAKER_03]: four corners right southwest of Medford Square, the orange right under the words Medford Square.

249
00:38:06,926 --> 00:38:16,429
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty sure the buildings on the northwest, northeast, and southeast corners of that intersection are apartments or condos.

250
00:38:17,257 --> 00:38:25,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Could you go into it all the condition of the buildings, south of South Street and west of what I think is Thomas Street of my mind is correct.

251
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:34,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, This title piece right here in this you are to district.

252
00:38:58,055 --> 00:38:58,836
[SPEAKER_07]: care if you could.

253
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:02,680
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

254
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:04,762
[SPEAKER_01]: If I remember correctly.

255
00:39:04,822 --> 00:39:05,062
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

256
00:39:05,102 --> 00:39:09,447
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of buildings that I looked in to do this.

257
00:39:10,388 --> 00:39:13,631
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there were I think there was.

258
00:39:14,232 --> 00:39:15,973
[SPEAKER_01]: These were multifamily

259
00:39:17,054 --> 00:39:24,239
[SPEAKER_01]: above the six units, if I'm not mistaken, and these were up to three stories.

260
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:33,644
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why the category would go into the urban too, only because it's multifamily, more than six.

261
00:39:35,245 --> 00:39:40,709
[SPEAKER_01]: I can look at that and check if that is as I remember.

262
00:39:41,269 --> 00:39:45,752
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, yeah, if you could, just that's the only thing I looked at that I saw that I thought might be.

263
00:39:48,907 --> 00:39:57,113
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just that south, you know, if we take the four corners of that intersection, that southwest piece, I might be remembering the built condition differently than it actually exists.

264
00:40:01,056 --> 00:40:04,479
[SPEAKER_03]: But thank you, and I really appreciate this updated proposal.

265
00:40:04,499 --> 00:40:12,886
[SPEAKER_03]: I think just making clear to everyone that we're talking about three-story structures in these neighborhoods is just really important.

266
00:40:14,648 --> 00:40:18,729
[SPEAKER_03]: and that, you know, dimensional requirements and those other things are going to really come into play.

267
00:40:18,829 --> 00:40:43,677
[SPEAKER_03]: But, oh, the only other thing we talked a little bit about, kind of a design guideline or, I don't know, advice, something like that around slopes of roof lines and enabling that third story to be mostly utilized, but also try to keep with some of the

268
00:40:44,524 --> 00:40:47,086
[SPEAKER_03]: to avoid the flat roof kind of effect.

269
00:40:48,146 --> 00:40:52,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that something we might be talking about for when we talk about dimensional as well?

270
00:40:57,833 --> 00:41:00,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, so that is correct.

271
00:41:00,414 --> 00:41:12,442
[SPEAKER_02]: As we look at the dimensional standards, we wanted to get the geography set because we'll go back to our mapping of existing nonconformities and see what we need to do in each area.

272
00:41:13,022 --> 00:41:18,427
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, how close can we get to the ideal for each of these zone types?

273
00:41:18,527 --> 00:41:20,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we need modifications for a specific area?

274
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:33,781
[SPEAKER_02]: And then yes, that idea of we'd like the residential buildings to be consistent with what's in Medford, but also consistent with good design going forward.

275
00:41:33,842 --> 00:41:36,844
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can look at the slope of roofs, we can look at

276
00:41:37,685 --> 00:41:46,609
[SPEAKER_02]: as we've done in other communities, we can look at things like how are dormers attached and are there proportional requirements for additions and things like that.

277
00:41:46,729 --> 00:42:01,396
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can think that through and is that better expressed in the zoning or is it better expressed in an advisory design guidelines component, which is outside zoning, but used in certain processes.

278
00:42:01,596 --> 00:42:03,357
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're keeping that in mind.

279
00:42:03,377 --> 00:42:04,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, thank you.

280
00:42:08,409 --> 00:42:08,970
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

281
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:10,571
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll go next to Councilor Leung.

282
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:17,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

283
00:42:17,335 --> 00:42:25,820
[SPEAKER_05]: So just some general requests for the consultants and city staff either to clarify what's currently

284
00:42:27,334 --> 00:42:31,258
[SPEAKER_05]: in the zoning or what some of the options could be moving forward.

285
00:42:31,278 --> 00:42:50,116
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm currently working in a city group that is investigating the possibility of starting up a community land trust and we were looking at a couple of different potential city-owned parcels around the city and some of them were

286
00:42:51,844 --> 00:42:55,848
[SPEAKER_05]: some of them were constrained by current zoning.

287
00:42:55,888 --> 00:43:07,179
[SPEAKER_05]: So even if we were to decide to put a community land trust in some of these areas, it would be very little community owned affordable housing that could actually be built.

288
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:12,104
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would like to know just for a future meeting or

289
00:43:12,865 --> 00:43:13,946
[SPEAKER_05]: what are the options for even an email?

290
00:43:14,046 --> 00:43:20,572
[SPEAKER_05]: What some options for something like that would be like, um, what are the cities?

291
00:43:21,273 --> 00:43:22,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, there's a city.

292
00:43:22,794 --> 00:43:28,999
[SPEAKER_05]: What are the cities are currently currently offer in terms of an inclusionary overlay?

293
00:43:29,019 --> 00:43:31,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Um and is there a possibility of putting

294
00:43:36,085 --> 00:43:39,666
[SPEAKER_05]: is infill zoning going to be a part of this?

295
00:43:40,027 --> 00:43:48,569
[SPEAKER_05]: That's another thing that I would like to see just kind of mentioned or explored.

296
00:43:50,190 --> 00:44:03,054
[SPEAKER_05]: I've also been pushing a lot for a transportation demand management program because, which I understand we're going to discuss in April, but Everett has implemented that very successfully, and I would

297
00:44:05,075 --> 00:44:22,543
[SPEAKER_05]: like to see if some of the consultants would be able to reach out to some of the planners within Everett to understand some of the details of how they've implemented that and whether it's only applied to urban areas or whether something like that usually goes into residential areas.

298
00:44:22,583 --> 00:44:25,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Essentially just a little bit more information on some of these

299
00:44:27,066 --> 00:44:34,530
[SPEAKER_05]: not specifically the zoning maps, but some of the rules that could apply to residential areas.

300
00:44:35,831 --> 00:44:36,712
[SPEAKER_05]: So, thank you.

301
00:44:42,855 --> 00:44:46,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councillor, we're happy to look into that.

302
00:44:46,736 --> 00:44:54,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Delighted to talk to Everett about their experience and how well that's worked and the extent of where their transportation demand management program is applied.

303
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:06,824
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that in thinking about how to allow for some of the possibilities of infill development, some of that will come with the dimensional standards.

304
00:45:06,884 --> 00:45:10,365
[SPEAKER_02]: We know already that there's some issues about existing lot sizes.

305
00:45:11,185 --> 00:45:14,726
[SPEAKER_02]: where the actual lot sizes are non-conforming with the zoning.

306
00:45:14,826 --> 00:45:18,968
[SPEAKER_02]: So in right-sizing that, that should open up some opportunities for infill.

307
00:45:19,408 --> 00:45:20,728
[SPEAKER_02]: We can see what that might mean.

308
00:45:20,769 --> 00:45:22,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we need to add others?

309
00:45:22,689 --> 00:45:33,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly also, I think bringing in, as you know, we have Jonathan Silverstein as the legal consultant on this, and he may also have some ideas

310
00:45:34,494 --> 00:45:39,558
[SPEAKER_02]: about other strategies that communities have used to add affordable housing in different ways.

311
00:45:39,678 --> 00:45:43,541
[SPEAKER_02]: So in addition to the work that we've done, we will also consult with him on that.

312
00:45:43,601 --> 00:45:47,624
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think we can find some options for the city councilors to discuss.

313
00:45:48,004 --> 00:45:49,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy to look into that.

314
00:45:51,307 --> 00:45:51,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

315
00:45:51,607 --> 00:45:53,468
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

316
00:45:54,449 --> 00:45:57,692
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Lemming for those suggestions and President Behrs.

317
00:46:01,898 --> 00:46:06,361
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you again for updating this proposal with a lot of our questions and suggestions.

318
00:46:07,662 --> 00:46:23,273
[SPEAKER_15]: From the past couple meetings really glad to see that a couple of the couple of the areas that really jumped out at a lot of counselors like in West Medford has been, I think, I think we came to consensus so that'd be more appropriate at our lowest level of density great to see that reassigned and we had a

319
00:46:24,893 --> 00:46:33,577
[SPEAKER_15]: very robust discussion around Lawrence Estates and the border of Forest Avenue last time, so thank you for making those adjustments as well.

320
00:46:34,237 --> 00:46:42,300
[SPEAKER_15]: Now that the urban residential subdistricts have entered the frame, I had just another kind of one more

321
00:46:44,027 --> 00:46:46,208
[SPEAKER_15]: relatively minor in the grand scheme of things.

322
00:46:46,288 --> 00:46:51,750
[SPEAKER_15]: As far as the map goes, question that I was hoping to get your assessment on either now or something to peruse before our next meeting.

323
00:46:53,851 --> 00:47:04,976
[SPEAKER_15]: Looking at the transit proximate zone around Magoon Square in South Medford, there's an urban residential one subdistrict right around the T stop.

324
00:47:06,076 --> 00:47:10,177
[SPEAKER_15]: It's abutted by neighborhood residential three on a lot of sides, actually on all sides.

325
00:47:10,217 --> 00:47:12,058
[SPEAKER_15]: It's abutted by neighborhood residential three.

326
00:47:13,718 --> 00:47:17,479
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think the urban residential one sub district is appropriate.

327
00:47:17,519 --> 00:47:23,561
[SPEAKER_15]: That's reflective of, you know, obviously, as is the case with the rest of the map, that's reflective of the type of housing that's already there.

328
00:47:24,061 --> 00:47:30,823
[SPEAKER_15]: My question is for the kind of corridor of neighborhood residential three that travels down Main Street to where it intersects with Broadway.

329
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:38,171
[SPEAKER_15]: I would be curious for your assessment on recategorizing that as urban residential one.

330
00:47:38,991 --> 00:47:50,253
[SPEAKER_15]: In my assessment, that is pretty similar to a lot of the existing residential types and topography that we see in the sub-district that is labeled residential, urban residential one.

331
00:47:50,934 --> 00:47:59,335
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think equally as importantly, it's one of the areas in the city that is actually really well served by bus lines, a couple of bus lines that go straight down to Sullivan.

332
00:47:59,355 --> 00:48:02,036
[SPEAKER_15]: I think there's a lot of transit users that live right around there.

333
00:48:02,836 --> 00:48:14,089
[SPEAKER_15]: And I wonder if that could be upgraded to urban residential one to reflect that and then have it grade down into neighborhood residential three in keeping with the current proposal.

334
00:48:21,677 --> 00:48:22,638
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm hard to hear over the fan.

335
00:48:22,878 --> 00:48:23,239
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, weird.

336
00:48:30,330 --> 00:48:31,011
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you hear me better now?

337
00:48:31,092 --> 00:48:31,773
[SPEAKER_15]: I can repeat myself.

338
00:48:32,715 --> 00:48:32,775
Oh.

339
00:48:35,352 --> 00:48:42,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, because the air turned on we're not quite sure which just do I think we didn't all didn't quite catch which district that you meant.

340
00:48:42,757 --> 00:48:58,949
[SPEAKER_02]: So, the short answer is we're happy to relook and see the type of, you know, the building types that are in the area, and understand whether or not it should be reclassified so yes to that always happy to look at that but we just want to confirm the area.

341
00:48:59,390 --> 00:49:03,152
[SPEAKER_15]: Absolutely, yes, sorry about that the air conditioning in this room is.

342
00:49:04,365 --> 00:49:06,446
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, famously louder than I am.

343
00:49:07,567 --> 00:49:14,912
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, the area that I'm talking about is the, uh, in South Medford, along the Main Street corridor.

344
00:49:14,932 --> 00:49:27,600
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, you have the Urban Residential 1 subdistrict that's in the Magoon Square T-stop radius, and then southeast of that, on either side of Main Street, we have Neighborhood Residential 3.

345
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:33,464
[SPEAKER_15]: My observation is that I think an existing residential type that's really similar to what we see in Urban Residential 1

346
00:49:34,384 --> 00:49:41,208
[SPEAKER_15]: and it's very well served by a couple of bus lines that go straight down Broadway to Somerville, sorry, Sullivan Station.

347
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:47,712
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'd like to see that assessed for if it would make sense to upgrade it to UR1.

348
00:49:53,656 --> 00:49:54,817
[SPEAKER_02]: We've confirmed that area.

349
00:49:54,837 --> 00:49:56,038
[SPEAKER_15]: We're happy to reassess that.

350
00:49:56,078 --> 00:49:57,558
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you so much for clarifying.

351
00:49:57,779 --> 00:49:57,999
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

352
00:49:58,219 --> 00:49:58,539
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

353
00:49:58,599 --> 00:50:01,041
[SPEAKER_15]: Also just repeating myself for the benefit of those on Zoom.

354
00:50:01,181 --> 00:50:01,461
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

355
00:50:04,898 --> 00:50:05,999
[SPEAKER_15]: Going next to President Behrs.

356
00:50:10,883 --> 00:50:12,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Chair Collins.

357
00:50:14,306 --> 00:50:27,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Similarly, yeah, I definitely agree that that area between Main Street and Medford Street that contains Bow Street and Dexter Street and some of those others is something to be considered.

358
00:50:27,857 --> 00:50:29,418
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm also looking at the

359
00:50:35,977 --> 00:50:41,600
[SPEAKER_03]: area between Boston Ave and the Somerville border.

360
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:50,325
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just those three, three kind of parcels on, or sections of parcels on like Bristol.

361
00:50:51,045 --> 00:51:01,771
[SPEAKER_03]: And those might, I think you might wanna, those could be, I think, considered as well, just because they're so proximate to Ball Square and so proximate to,

362
00:51:03,368 --> 00:51:07,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Somerville zoning, including in some cases, like on the other side of the street.

363
00:51:08,771 --> 00:51:11,333
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that they're zoned up to three.

364
00:51:11,813 --> 00:51:21,038
[SPEAKER_03]: So that might just be another place to think about just with the transit access on, I can't think of the other names of those roads, but those three right there.

365
00:51:21,679 --> 00:51:30,464
[SPEAKER_03]: And something I think I've had, just looking at this area, some questions about

366
00:51:32,472 --> 00:51:34,893
[SPEAKER_03]: is Harvard Street in general.

367
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:56,065
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just wondering if... I mean, I think it'll be relatively easy when we talk about the corridors to decide more specifically what the corridor parcels are.

368
00:51:56,105 --> 00:51:59,347
[SPEAKER_03]: And it looks like from your nodding heads, that's kind of the thought that you guys are having as well.

369
00:52:00,456 --> 00:52:07,923
[SPEAKER_03]: And I see that on Main Street and Medford Street, but I have just a general qualm about Harvard Street.

370
00:52:08,924 --> 00:52:25,718
[SPEAKER_03]: It's certainly a corridor from the perspective of vehicular bike walking traffic, like it's a connecting street, but the built condition really is, I think, pretty much continuous with the neighborhoods.

371
00:52:29,253 --> 00:52:49,507
[SPEAKER_03]: So just looking at that, I can see coming back to it after we do the corridors, but I think there's just as strong an argument to be made that maybe we should just connect the districts that are currently separated out to the east and the west of Main Street as we are right now.

372
00:52:49,947 --> 00:52:53,910
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm interested to hear more what you guys were thinking there.

373
00:52:55,444 --> 00:53:04,348
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll let Paula answer to the what we were thinking the specific place but I do want to touch on that larger issue that you know we're taking the city pieces at a time.

374
00:53:04,908 --> 00:53:13,112
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think for almost everything maybe with the exception of Mystic Avenue which was fairly self contained I think when we looked at in many ways.

375
00:53:13,692 --> 00:53:32,511
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think as we fill in the other quarters, the squares, we're likely going to see some areas where we want to make some final boundary changes, I think as we get more information as not just the input from yourselves but from members of the public that we've heard from during this process that there's probably going to be sort of a

376
00:53:33,632 --> 00:53:35,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, let's look at that parcel a little bit harder.

377
00:53:35,313 --> 00:53:37,213
[SPEAKER_02]: It needs to go one way versus the other.

378
00:53:37,394 --> 00:53:43,636
[SPEAKER_02]: So we think it's really important, as we're doing now to get the neighborhoods as right as possible.

379
00:53:44,316 --> 00:53:51,299
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think we should all be aware that we may have to come back and just make some changes to those boundaries sometimes boundaries a little fuzzy.

380
00:53:51,879 --> 00:54:02,463
[SPEAKER_02]: So what looks right, either when you're on the ground or what looks like when you're on the looking down on the map don't always agree and so which is of course one of the reasons we're having these conversations but

381
00:54:02,903 --> 00:54:05,705
[SPEAKER_02]: just to be aware that there'll be some fine tuning towards the end.

382
00:54:06,566 --> 00:54:16,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Just before, just directionally, we're probably talking about the neighborhood zones moving in towards the corridors, not the other way around.

383
00:54:16,554 --> 00:54:25,320
[SPEAKER_03]: So people probably parcels that might not be in the neighborhood boundary right now, probably ending up in them versus the other way around.

384
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:26,101
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

385
00:54:29,383 --> 00:54:31,585
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I agree with you that that was a very like,

386
00:54:33,496 --> 00:54:38,261
[SPEAKER_01]: If we have Mystic that is regional, then we have others that are more like neighborhood.

387
00:54:38,741 --> 00:54:40,804
[SPEAKER_01]: This was even a lower scale of those.

388
00:54:41,504 --> 00:54:50,153
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that maybe at the end, we'll end up with just the crossing with the other to be just that corner of mixed.

389
00:54:50,834 --> 00:54:55,258
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the rest would be the residential matching with the neighborhood and what is already there.

390
00:54:56,919 --> 00:55:05,482
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't mean that because we say a corridor is going to be all mixed use, there will be like we have in Salem blocks, entire blocks that are residential.

391
00:55:06,002 --> 00:55:17,246
[SPEAKER_01]: So once we look at that street, we will see maybe it's only when it touches Main Street that then is that corner of mixed, but then the rest is just residential.

392
00:55:18,586 --> 00:55:18,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

393
00:55:19,166 --> 00:55:19,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

394
00:55:19,386 --> 00:55:20,227
[SPEAKER_03]: And that makes sense.

395
00:55:20,267 --> 00:55:24,248
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think, you know, some element of the

396
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:44,430
[SPEAKER_03]: The more I looked at it, the more I was like this feels more like kind of that dashed corridor along high street that we have and I think there's probably Some of Boston have a budding parcels to and I see them, you know, you have the Boston have parcels on the southwest side of Boston have that are in the neighborhood zone and

397
00:55:45,586 --> 00:55:47,927
[SPEAKER_03]: up to a certain point and then you have the mixed uses.

398
00:55:48,007 --> 00:56:10,216
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I see where you're going for there, but I think it's just important to note for folks that like, just because something is still in that kind of mixed use square and quarter boundary right now, there's a likelihood, especially if it seems like a lot of the existing structures are purely residential, that those are gonna end up being

399
00:56:11,132 --> 00:56:16,767
[SPEAKER_03]: part of the residential districts or something rather than part of the mixed use or square corridor type districts.

400
00:56:17,894 --> 00:56:33,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and I want to echo what Paula said you know as we're learning from looking at Salem Street which is defined as a quarter we're hearing, you know, as we boots on the ground again right is that idea of what's a quarter versus what's a neighborhood.

401
00:56:34,163 --> 00:56:41,667
[SPEAKER_02]: We've also talked about these areas of neighborhood hubs where there's already existing commercial that serving neighborhoods.

402
00:56:42,347 --> 00:57:06,557
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we make those conforming how do we allow for those without disrupting neighborhoods so I think we're learning some, some lessons from for talking with Salem looking at Salem delving into that, that will then apply of that push pull of where neighborhood is versus where the mixed uses is and then what are mixed uses are sorry my English is going on a Wednesday.

403
00:57:07,958 --> 00:57:16,464
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also, you know, where do we have these hubs of activity at what scale versus where do we go back into the neighborhood?

404
00:57:16,504 --> 00:57:19,827
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that will be a continuing conversation as we move through this.

405
00:57:21,929 --> 00:57:29,955
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's a good, this back and forth, this iterative back and forth I really think lends itself to that process of evaluation.

406
00:57:30,535 --> 00:57:31,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, thank you.

407
00:57:35,747 --> 00:57:37,688
[SPEAKER_15]: Great, thank you, President Behrs, I appreciate that point.

408
00:57:40,810 --> 00:57:44,271
[SPEAKER_15]: Do I see any additional comments or questions?

409
00:57:45,852 --> 00:57:46,653
[SPEAKER_15]: President Behrs, go ahead.

410
00:57:48,674 --> 00:57:53,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, just, I know there was also the commercial nodes, so maybe we wanna talk about that.

411
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:00,480
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh?

412
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:04,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the little, yeah, there was that map where there was just like the tiny,

413
00:58:05,656 --> 00:58:15,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Within these districts, there are a few places that have commercial on them.

414
00:58:20,227 --> 00:58:21,888
[SPEAKER_15]: One second while we find the right file.

415
00:58:21,908 --> 00:58:26,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, just- Do you want to move to the neighborhood hubs?

416
00:58:26,792 --> 00:58:29,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Just, yeah, talked about those, the commercial nodes and the residential districts.

417
00:58:29,914 --> 00:58:30,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Were we going to talk about that?

418
00:58:40,112 --> 00:58:41,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, if you want to go to that, yes.

419
00:58:42,034 --> 00:58:42,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Go for it.

420
00:58:45,837 --> 00:58:46,377
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's fine.

421
00:58:47,238 --> 00:58:47,598
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry.

422
00:58:47,819 --> 00:58:59,529
[SPEAKER_16]: We were sideboring a little bit because there's another area that now that I'm looking at it again, I'm realizing maybe we should consider it being different than the way it's presented on the map.

423
00:58:59,649 --> 00:59:03,011
[SPEAKER_16]: And so I just wanted to raise that to you all tonight.

424
00:59:03,912 --> 00:59:06,995
[SPEAKER_16]: rather than have it just show up different because I said so off line.

425
00:59:07,776 --> 00:59:21,868
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, so there's an area that's urban, so I just wanted to make sure like sort of flag in this proposal urban residential one and two doesn't actually allow single dwelling units by right so single family homes.

426
00:59:22,548 --> 00:59:25,011
[SPEAKER_16]: in those neighborhoods would become non-conforming.

427
00:59:25,531 --> 00:59:28,374
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're generally trying not to make things non-conforming.

428
00:59:29,015 --> 00:59:42,988
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you look at the area that I think if I describe as the top T stop, there's an UR1 and urban residential one right above it that is actually very heavy single family homes.

429
00:59:44,049 --> 00:59:58,452
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm proposing whether that would actually be more appropriately NR3, because the request for density is because those homes have the best proximity to a T-stop anywhere in Medford that is really walkable.

430
00:59:58,972 --> 01:00:00,892
[SPEAKER_16]: So you should be allowing more density.

431
01:00:01,813 --> 01:00:08,674
[SPEAKER_16]: But I'm mildly concerned about making that entire area nonconforming and how that would play out.

432
01:00:09,167 --> 01:00:10,948
[SPEAKER_16]: in the long run for various things.

433
01:00:11,708 --> 01:00:23,633
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe leaving the area that's already very heavy to family as urban residential one, because two unit dwellings are by right in urban residential ones.

434
01:00:26,254 --> 01:00:32,176
[SPEAKER_16]: So I just, I kind of wanted to flag that as something we should look at again.

435
01:00:32,196 --> 01:00:35,838
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think Emily wants to follow up on that.

436
01:00:42,535 --> 01:00:43,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, with your permission Madam Chair.

437
01:00:44,616 --> 01:00:45,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for bringing that up.

438
01:00:46,316 --> 01:01:02,382
[SPEAKER_02]: We had been talking about that in house as you would imagine, and so we were balancing that idea of making the single family not as a right but putting in protection so that non conforming single family

439
01:01:02,942 --> 01:01:05,043
[SPEAKER_02]: would be exempt from certain waivers.

440
01:01:05,123 --> 01:01:07,864
[SPEAKER_02]: We've used that tax in other places before.

441
01:01:07,944 --> 01:01:22,110
[SPEAKER_02]: So for example, if you're a non-conforming, you wanted to put a porch on, you weren't having to go to the ZBA to do that or whatever you might otherwise have to get a waiver for, you were able to do it as of right.

442
01:01:23,370 --> 01:01:30,553
[SPEAKER_02]: So whether it's a change in the district, which of course, obviously we continue to be open to in this iterative process,

443
01:01:31,694 --> 01:01:39,680
[SPEAKER_02]: or whether it's putting in that non-conforming exemptions for the single families in those neighborhoods.

444
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:46,886
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're open to figuring out with you the solution that makes the most sense for these districts.

445
01:01:48,147 --> 01:01:58,015
[SPEAKER_02]: And that may be something that we continue to leave open for a little bit until maybe after you've seen what that language would look like, or it's something that we address now, whichever makes sense at this point.

446
01:01:59,648 --> 01:02:00,068
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

447
01:02:00,248 --> 01:02:01,229
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll go to President Behrs.

448
01:02:01,789 --> 01:02:02,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.

449
01:02:02,770 --> 01:02:12,615
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think just one thing on that topic that I think the most important thing that I think we were reminding a lot of folks on this on Monday night, right.

450
01:02:14,096 --> 01:02:21,320
[SPEAKER_03]: The goal generally is that and obviously like to change the zoning does not mean that someone has to change anything about their property.

451
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:25,662
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're a single family home, and you don't want to change anything about it,

452
01:02:26,527 --> 01:02:29,388
[SPEAKER_03]: just because the zoning district changes doesn't mean you have to change anything.

453
01:02:31,729 --> 01:02:51,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Something we're also trying to control for here, and it's tough, right, is, and because state law has special exemptions for single-family zoning, it makes it even harder for single-family structures, the proximity

454
01:02:52,516 --> 01:03:09,232
[SPEAKER_03]: of that of those parcels to the transit access, even before the Green Line extension we've been seeing a lot of a lot of neighborhoods, very very large single family new or significantly renovated single family structures being built, and I think we don't

455
01:03:10,712 --> 01:03:12,393
[SPEAKER_03]: want to see that.

456
01:03:12,413 --> 01:03:13,974
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just not what we want to see.

457
01:03:14,014 --> 01:03:26,983
[SPEAKER_03]: I think most people generally who live here now are not happy to see what was a relatively standard-sized single-family unit turn into a mini-mansion that's maxing out lot size and dimensionals.

458
01:03:27,684 --> 01:03:35,109
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the closer you are to a T-station, the more that the financials are probably going to break down for a property owner or developer to say,

459
01:03:35,771 --> 01:03:37,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I could build a single family here.

460
01:03:37,692 --> 01:03:43,074
[SPEAKER_03]: I could take this relatively normal sized single family, turn it into this giant 3,800, 4,000 square foot single family.

461
01:03:43,094 --> 01:03:45,295
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 500 feet from the T and sell it for $2.2 million, right?

462
01:03:52,555 --> 01:03:59,281
[SPEAKER_03]: when you could have, if you don't allow the by right new construction or significant renovation, at least they'd have to do two units.

463
01:04:00,182 --> 01:04:11,493
[SPEAKER_03]: And the goal would be to incentivize them to do three or four because for 1000 square foot units is gonna be much better close to something like that in a walkable neighborhood than a giant mansion.

464
01:04:11,513 --> 01:04:17,038
[SPEAKER_03]: So I kind of like more interested or amenable to the idea of saying,

465
01:04:18,313 --> 01:04:45,088
[SPEAKER_03]: how can we make sure that people who are in existing single families now don't get that, by not allowing single family buy right, we can avoid all the impacts of them becoming nonconforming versus saying, we're gonna allow the single family so close to the transit where the land value is so high and then maybe get these weird externalities of big new single family housing exactly where we don't want it to be.

466
01:04:53,870 --> 01:04:54,891
[SPEAKER_16]: PB, Lisa Smith-Miyazaki, she-her, hers.

467
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:09,221
[SPEAKER_16]: before, now you need to go to the variance.

468
01:05:09,261 --> 01:05:12,942
[SPEAKER_16]: And we do not wanna be sending a lot of single family homes to the ZBA.

469
01:05:13,402 --> 01:05:19,804
[SPEAKER_16]: So like some of the things that I signed off on building permits today were, you know, they wanted to expand the kitchen.

470
01:05:19,884 --> 01:05:22,885
[SPEAKER_16]: So they took the porch and they turned it into a kitchen, right?

471
01:05:22,905 --> 01:05:30,048
[SPEAKER_16]: Like they turned it into a room and people who wanted to add dormers on because, or a second floor onto a one and a half story house.

472
01:05:30,428 --> 01:05:35,290
[SPEAKER_16]: Like those are things that people should be able to continue to do without having to go to the ZBA.

473
01:05:36,370 --> 01:05:39,231
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's the kind of thing that we want to hit that balance.

474
01:05:39,271 --> 01:05:50,073
[SPEAKER_16]: So if there's a way to put that in so that those existing single families don't suddenly become like unable to do any nice improvements to their house.

475
01:05:50,373 --> 01:05:56,094
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm not sure, like I don't actually know how far, like I was signing off on kitchen remodels and new bathrooms today.

476
01:05:56,554 --> 01:06:01,195
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, I don't think that would actually fall under here, but I honestly don't know.

477
01:06:01,915 --> 01:06:02,055
[SPEAKER_16]: So.

478
01:06:05,492 --> 01:06:07,693
[SPEAKER_13]: And if I may add something to that.

479
01:06:08,394 --> 01:06:17,820
[SPEAKER_13]: So now that the protected use ADUs are our law and we're trying to update our process.

480
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:20,622
[SPEAKER_13]: So our zoning isn't updated, but we have to allow these.

481
01:06:20,702 --> 01:06:22,883
[SPEAKER_13]: So the building commissioner and I today were

482
01:06:23,341 --> 01:06:36,667
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, going back and forth of trying to adapt our accessory structure ordinance to the new regulations that were recently promulgated and

483
01:06:39,333 --> 01:07:02,566
[SPEAKER_13]: One thing that I'm concerned about is, so they're only allowed, but we could have more permissive requirements or allowances for ADUs, but right now the protected use ADU is only required to be allowed in single family zoning districts, which they defined as any zoning district where single families are allowed, either by right or by special permit.

484
01:07:02,966 --> 01:07:03,206
[SPEAKER_13]: So,

485
01:07:05,328 --> 01:07:13,644
[SPEAKER_13]: if you have a single family in the UR1, would they be able to add an A to you or would that just be something that we would have to amend our zoning?

486
01:07:13,664 --> 01:07:15,648
[SPEAKER_13]: So it wouldn't, yeah.

487
01:07:21,362 --> 01:07:23,163
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is correct.

488
01:07:23,283 --> 01:07:27,305
[SPEAKER_02]: It's any district in which single families are allowed as of right or best special permit.

489
01:07:27,405 --> 01:07:40,851
[SPEAKER_02]: So if for the urban one or the urban two, which don't allow single family as of right, then ADUs would not be allowed because they're not allowed as of right and single families not allowed as of right in that district.

490
01:07:41,551 --> 01:07:46,133
[SPEAKER_02]: We did discuss that at one point as well to try and think of what the implications were.

491
01:07:46,813 --> 01:07:54,318
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't mean that you couldn't allow a to use in those districts but they wouldn't follow our, our understanding is they wouldn't fall under that law.

492
01:07:56,619 --> 01:07:57,039
[SPEAKER_02]: That helps.

493
01:07:57,059 --> 01:08:05,885
[SPEAKER_15]: Great, thank you for the discussion on that.

494
01:08:06,145 --> 01:08:08,947
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, hang on one second counselor Kelly.

495
01:08:11,055 --> 01:08:12,657
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wanted a super quick clarification.

496
01:08:12,797 --> 01:08:24,507
[SPEAKER_14]: It sounds like you're saying that if we don't do anything differently, and this is a UR1, but there's a lot of single family homes, they will not be able to build an ADU.

497
01:08:25,208 --> 01:08:34,936
[SPEAKER_14]: And I just want to have a little check in, maybe I missed it, but that we can, in fact, write something into the zoning to ensure that they will be able to do an ADU by right?

498
01:08:44,348 --> 01:08:53,598
[SPEAKER_16]: So, Madam Chair, we could we could say that are that at us are allowed on single family homes in this district or single or two family, whatever it is.

499
01:08:53,618 --> 01:09:00,926
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that the state sort of sets a floor for what we're allowed to do but if we want to allow more than that.

500
01:09:03,423 --> 01:09:07,044
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to make sure that we're not like allowing ADUs in all the single family places.

501
01:09:07,264 --> 01:09:15,006
[SPEAKER_14]: But if there happens to be a single family home in a, you know, zoned something that's not single family, that they're not then not allowed to do the same thing all the other single families are.

502
01:09:15,246 --> 01:09:15,526
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks.

503
01:09:17,326 --> 01:09:24,948
[SPEAKER_15]: I think the question just to paraphrase is, we want to make sure that a non conforming single family home could still build an ADU.

504
01:09:26,815 --> 01:09:28,236
[SPEAKER_15]: Or I'm paraphrasing your question.

505
01:09:29,316 --> 01:09:35,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it is our understanding that you can always be more permissive, but you can't be less permissive.

506
01:09:35,478 --> 01:09:36,558
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't be more restrictive.

507
01:09:37,519 --> 01:09:37,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

508
01:09:38,079 --> 01:09:38,559
[SPEAKER_02]: President Behrs?

509
01:09:38,819 --> 01:09:50,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to draw this down to maybe an unnecessary rabbit hole of use case, but this is probably only going to apply if they want the accessory unit and accessory structure right.

510
01:09:51,003 --> 01:09:55,225
[SPEAKER_03]: Because otherwise, if it's in the principal structure, they just call it a two unit, and that's allowed by right.

511
01:09:59,402 --> 01:10:00,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes and no.

512
01:10:00,844 --> 01:10:14,677
[SPEAKER_02]: So ADU, the difference between a two unit structure and a single unit with an ADU is that ADUs usually have size restrictions, whereas a two, so you could have, I think the state is 900 right now, 900 or 50%.

513
01:10:14,817 --> 01:10:15,418
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you, Paula.

514
01:10:21,844 --> 01:10:24,626
[SPEAKER_02]: for bringing up the right amount, I should have just looked over at your screen.

515
01:10:25,706 --> 01:10:30,249
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is the difference is the size restriction for the ADU.

516
01:10:30,369 --> 01:10:40,474
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and the parking as the other piece is that the state has requirements on the parking for those districts where the state law applies, they have requirements in the parking.

517
01:10:42,335 --> 01:10:43,376
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a choice there.

518
01:10:43,416 --> 01:10:50,440
[SPEAKER_02]: There is also the practical matter of can a single unit, single family,

519
01:10:51,020 --> 01:10:59,066
[SPEAKER_02]: be retrofitted to be either a two unit, or a single with an ADU, or then do you need that detached ADU?

520
01:10:59,146 --> 01:11:08,753
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's, there's a thing where zoning says one thing, but the practicalities of market and construction and building code and all of that say something else.

521
01:11:09,833 --> 01:11:13,756
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's, it's, it's certainly case specific, right?

522
01:11:14,537 --> 01:11:14,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Where

523
01:11:16,192 --> 01:11:21,056
[SPEAKER_03]: the two unit, you would have more freedom as to the square footage, but maybe a higher parking requirement.

524
01:11:21,636 --> 01:11:26,339
[SPEAKER_03]: So you might choose to do the ADU because the parking requirements 0.5 less.

525
01:11:26,780 --> 01:11:29,422
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you can fit that on a lot based on the dimensionals.

526
01:11:30,402 --> 01:11:38,408
[SPEAKER_03]: But certainly, I guess my main question is, you'd have to do that if they wanted to do it in a non-principle structure, right?

527
01:11:39,689 --> 01:11:41,791
[SPEAKER_03]: But you couldn't have, because we're not allowing two

528
01:11:43,208 --> 01:11:45,690
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm assuming we're not allowing two principal structures on the same lot.

529
01:11:45,770 --> 01:11:51,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they couldn't say it's a two unit, but one unit's in a detached garage and one unit's in the principal structure.

530
01:11:51,795 --> 01:11:52,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yes.

531
01:11:52,855 --> 01:11:58,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but it would be a detached ADU at that point rather than a duplex is attached.

532
01:11:59,020 --> 01:12:01,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Some form of it is attached to each other.

533
01:12:01,542 --> 01:12:06,565
[SPEAKER_02]: So you wouldn't have principal house A and principal house B and call it a two unit.

534
01:12:06,946 --> 01:12:07,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, agreed.

535
01:12:07,626 --> 01:12:10,989
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a case where not allowing the ADU

536
01:12:11,810 --> 01:12:23,833
[SPEAKER_03]: For the non conforming single family would eliminate the ability to add a second unit either way, because, yeah, so I think that's where I'm just trying to take it down that yeah down that rabbit hole where like oh well.

537
01:12:24,827 --> 01:12:30,554
[SPEAKER_03]: But they could have two units anyway so do they need it but not if they wanted to detach structure if they want to preserve a carriage house or something.

538
01:12:30,574 --> 01:12:41,406
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and they may with respect they may want an ad you for other reasons right you know as opposed to a second entire unit there's a whole host of other reasons why that might be the case.

539
01:12:42,007 --> 01:13:02,097
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think then what that becomes is as we're looking at our non conforming language to address a single family house that is in a now in a district that doesn't allow single family, which is, I am certain although I haven't looked at, but in I have seen in other communities where you have a single family and a commercial district.

540
01:13:02,657 --> 01:13:13,007
[SPEAKER_02]: It's non-conforming, has to go through variances, so it's not an unusual case, but we want to add language that allows it to have waivers from those variances.

541
01:13:13,388 --> 01:13:21,095
[SPEAKER_02]: We also would want to add language that allows it to be able to put the ADU in there consistent with other single family, and we can do that.

542
01:13:21,455 --> 01:13:22,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, okay.

543
01:13:22,977 --> 01:13:24,899
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think, you know, I mean, I'm sure you'll do it, but...

544
01:13:25,982 --> 01:13:31,988
[SPEAKER_03]: We had some of these conversations when we were doing the new nonconforming sections of the recodification a couple of years ago.

545
01:13:32,629 --> 01:13:36,493
[SPEAKER_03]: So there may be some language that's already applying citywide that might help here.

546
01:13:37,233 --> 01:13:38,595
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll just need to evaluate that.

547
01:13:38,915 --> 01:13:39,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.

548
01:13:46,643 --> 01:13:47,364
[SPEAKER_15]: Great, thank you all.

549
01:13:49,516 --> 01:14:00,031
[SPEAKER_15]: I think this is a useful rabbit hole to be going on now as we're talking about, you know, other areas on the residential map, where we want to at least be looking at options for language for non conforming.

550
01:14:02,860 --> 01:14:26,958
[SPEAKER_15]: striking that right balance in between zoning these districts, such as that we are not including any things that are greater gifts to developers than they are to the community and residents, especially close to transit, but are also not creating unnecessary hurdles for folks who are living in what may become non-conforming structures in some of these recategorized residential sub-districts.

551
01:14:28,939 --> 01:14:29,940
[SPEAKER_15]: Go to Councilor Lemming.

552
01:14:31,858 --> 01:14:32,178
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

553
01:14:32,498 --> 01:14:52,954
[SPEAKER_05]: So not to go down, not to explore various steps of the rabbit hole too much, but just to remind the planners and consultants, some of the folks at Housing Medford and I did work on a draft of an ADU ordinance a couple of months ago, which we

554
01:14:55,123 --> 01:14:57,868
[SPEAKER_05]: discussed pretty extensively.

555
01:14:57,888 --> 01:15:02,936
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to make sure that that draft is on your radar.

556
01:15:04,198 --> 01:15:08,866
[SPEAKER_05]: And if it's sort of buried in layers of emails, then I can resend that to you.

557
01:15:09,683 --> 01:15:11,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, as well.

558
01:15:11,664 --> 01:15:20,026
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I understand that some parts of it might have changed because the some of the recent like state laws been updated since then.

559
01:15:20,066 --> 01:15:27,788
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's possible that, um, that that version of the ordinance parts of that version of the ordinance could be irrelevant.

560
01:15:27,808 --> 01:15:33,010
[SPEAKER_05]: But a lot of the work on rethinking 80 years has been done by local housing advocates.

561
01:15:33,690 --> 01:15:36,231
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, do y'all currently have that drafted?

562
01:15:37,613 --> 01:15:38,714
[SPEAKER_05]: like sitting around somewhere.

563
01:15:38,734 --> 01:15:41,976
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that Danielle, we had a meeting about that.

564
01:15:53,003 --> 01:15:58,287
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I can dig that up and take a look at it and see what is applicable or not.

565
01:15:58,827 --> 01:16:04,111
[SPEAKER_13]: I remember some of the things was changing, which are already things we have to change anyways, which is

566
01:16:05,339 --> 01:16:08,800
[SPEAKER_13]: eliminating the owner occupancy requirement in the affidavit.

567
01:16:09,861 --> 01:16:14,822
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm trying to remember what else, what's the big changes in there.

568
01:16:14,902 --> 01:16:23,325
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't recall if we, if there was a discussion about making the detached ADUs by right, or if those- I wrote a blog about it on my website on May 5th.

569
01:16:23,345 --> 01:16:26,406
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd explored the topic specifically.

570
01:16:26,486 --> 01:16:28,427
[SPEAKER_05]: Parts of it were, it was like,

571
01:16:29,361 --> 01:16:34,223
[SPEAKER_05]: the owner occupancy requirement I think was the was kind of the biggest like area of disagreement.

572
01:16:34,243 --> 01:16:56,909
[SPEAKER_05]: There were sort of good points on both sides about that and there is also like you know converting whether just like details of like converting a garage to an ADU versus like an attached ADU things like that but a lot of it should be in the draft of the the draft ordinance that we went over.

573
01:16:57,069 --> 01:16:58,430
[SPEAKER_05]: Although I do understand that it was

574
01:16:59,510 --> 01:17:02,212
[SPEAKER_05]: many moons ago at this point that we last discussed that.

575
01:17:02,512 --> 01:17:07,115
[SPEAKER_05]: But it is coming up on the timeline to get to that part of the discussion.

576
01:17:07,135 --> 01:17:13,740
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, so the good thing is we don't actually have to make that many changes to our ADU ordinance.

577
01:17:13,980 --> 01:17:17,022
[SPEAKER_13]: We just need to put in what are reasonable dimensional standards.

578
01:17:17,723 --> 01:17:19,244
[SPEAKER_13]: And one of the rules is that

579
01:17:19,852 --> 01:17:29,239
[SPEAKER_13]: they can't be more restrictive than what we would have for a single family or a regular, you know, everyday accessory structure.

580
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:39,027
[SPEAKER_13]: So if the setbacks for your accessory structure, which are three feet, then the ADU can only, can't be required to be more than three feet.

581
01:17:40,628 --> 01:17:43,070
[SPEAKER_13]: So you need to put those in.

582
01:17:45,435 --> 01:17:54,306
[SPEAKER_13]: You delete owner occupancy references and eliminate the special permit requirement for detached.

583
01:17:55,167 --> 01:17:59,412
[SPEAKER_13]: There was already a loophole where you could build an accessory structure and then

584
01:18:00,642 --> 01:18:03,344
[SPEAKER_13]: come back the next day and say, I want to convert this to an ADU.

585
01:18:03,404 --> 01:18:14,471
[SPEAKER_13]: So it was kind of like a meaningless provision in an ordinance anyways about needing to only, you could only have a detached ADU if it was an existing structure you were converting.

586
01:18:15,012 --> 01:18:18,714
[SPEAKER_13]: But it was meaningless, as I was saying.

587
01:18:18,754 --> 01:18:21,056
[SPEAKER_13]: So just deleting that and then

588
01:18:22,357 --> 01:18:31,326
[SPEAKER_13]: There will be the policy discussion of whether we would want to allow multiple ADUs on a lot by special permit, which is something that we can do.

589
01:18:32,067 --> 01:18:38,955
[SPEAKER_13]: And then also making it clear that they are not to be short-term rentals, or if

590
01:18:40,687 --> 01:18:45,791
[SPEAKER_13]: If it's their primary dwelling, can they rent it out as a short-term rental, but not as an exclusive short-term rental?

591
01:18:45,811 --> 01:18:51,616
[SPEAKER_13]: Because we definitely don't want that, because there's already so much damage to our neighborhoods from those.

592
01:18:54,199 --> 01:19:01,245
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll just re-share the documents, because I'm actually looking at a document in my Google Drive which has

593
01:19:02,259 --> 01:19:05,742
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of edits from the both of us from almost a year ago.

594
01:19:05,842 --> 01:19:13,929
[SPEAKER_05]: So that probably is a good refresher, but it doesn't have to be re like we don't have to go and down the rabbit hole too much during the meeting.

595
01:19:13,969 --> 01:19:14,389
[SPEAKER_05]: But thank you.

596
01:19:16,151 --> 01:19:17,011
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Lemming.

597
01:19:17,272 --> 01:19:18,012
[SPEAKER_15]: Go to President Beers.

598
01:19:18,733 --> 01:19:19,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.

599
01:19:19,053 --> 01:19:26,920
[SPEAKER_03]: And just on the short term rentals, I believe we updated that so that you can only do a maximum of 90 days a year anyway.

600
01:19:27,420 --> 01:19:29,322
[SPEAKER_03]: So that might address

601
01:19:31,285 --> 01:19:32,946
[SPEAKER_03]: parts of that question, at least.

602
01:19:42,929 --> 01:19:46,031
[SPEAKER_13]: But it depended on whether that was your primary dwelling.

603
01:19:46,051 --> 01:19:56,975
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you say if you have a two-family, you can't rent out the second unit as a short-term rental, because that's not actually your primary or your principal resident.

604
01:19:57,015 --> 01:19:59,156
[SPEAKER_13]: You're in one of the units, not the other one.

605
01:20:00,076 --> 01:20:08,487
[SPEAKER_13]: So there are some floating around that I believe, where there's a second unit that's just an Airbnb, like they no longer have long-term tenants.

606
01:20:08,507 --> 01:20:09,708
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's an enforcement thing.

607
01:20:10,169 --> 01:20:15,976
[SPEAKER_13]: But basically, the question would be if, say, you have a single-family house in an ADU,

608
01:20:17,097 --> 01:20:27,285
[SPEAKER_13]: can you, the ADU, if it's not your primary or principal residence, the houses, can you rent out your ADU at a limited basis for short-term rentals?

609
01:20:28,906 --> 01:20:35,331
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a policy decision that would have to be made that we would expressly state, because right now we just say your principal residence.

610
01:20:36,131 --> 01:20:38,313
[SPEAKER_13]: And is the ADU an extension of that?

611
01:20:38,333 --> 01:20:40,755
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know, but we should probably make it clear.

612
01:20:40,775 --> 01:20:44,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, that would make sense, because my inquisition would still fall under

613
01:20:46,329 --> 01:21:03,677
[SPEAKER_03]: a 90-day limit, but maybe they can make enough money in 90 days that it's worth it.

614
01:21:03,717 --> 01:21:05,778
[SPEAKER_15]: Anything additional on this, or were you just passing the mic back?

615
01:21:06,999 --> 01:21:07,879
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, great, just checking.

616
01:21:12,021 --> 01:21:12,942
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, thank you.

617
01:21:12,962 --> 01:21:15,403
[SPEAKER_15]: I think this has been a productive discussion on some of the

618
01:21:17,736 --> 01:21:23,818
[SPEAKER_15]: some of the accessory topics that residential zoning gets into pretty quickly.

619
01:21:23,838 --> 01:21:24,538
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you for that.

620
01:21:25,058 --> 01:21:27,339
[SPEAKER_15]: Lots of little threads to run down for next time, especially.

621
01:21:27,379 --> 01:21:33,761
[SPEAKER_15]: I think this is good timing as we start to get into the dimensionals, which we're going to be talking about next time, which will be our fourth meeting on the topic.

622
01:21:33,781 --> 01:21:36,022
[SPEAKER_15]: A good time to circle back to more of these topics.

623
01:21:37,503 --> 01:21:41,624
[SPEAKER_15]: Pell and Emily, was there another piece of the presentation that we should get to before, or did I

624
01:21:45,971 --> 01:21:49,194
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, so I can go quickly through it.

625
01:21:49,214 --> 01:21:57,982
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that we are starting to do an analysis on these commercial nodes for the residential neighborhoods.

626
01:21:59,103 --> 01:22:01,665
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are looking already at the existing

627
01:22:04,675 --> 01:22:08,879
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's it might be a bit difficult to see because they are not a lot.

628
01:22:08,959 --> 01:22:19,288
[SPEAKER_01]: But these red lots that you see over there in only the residential districts, these are already existing commercial, small commercial.

629
01:22:21,978 --> 01:22:22,438
[SPEAKER_01]: buildings.

630
01:22:24,139 --> 01:22:48,345
[SPEAKER_01]: So now what we are going to do is to study where we should have some notes in these residential areas to make also these conforming and that we can have a small scale commercial where you can have a small grocery store or we have to look into the uses that we will permit here.

631
01:22:48,765 --> 01:23:09,215
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's everything just very neighborhood, very small scale and obviously just to make a little cafe, bakery, small maybe co-working space or share space that were asked from the councillors and that we think it's a great idea.

632
01:23:09,235 --> 01:23:13,377
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are starting to look where we already have some of those commercial areas

633
01:23:14,198 --> 01:23:16,822
[SPEAKER_01]: And how could we group them?

634
01:23:17,744 --> 01:23:23,094
[SPEAKER_01]: And where are these good areas in this neighborhood, in this residential?

635
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:45,033
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I may, these are sort of the little nodes that we talked about when I first started planning somebody, another planner said hey did you know there's a five minute to ice cream rule and I don't think that's actually been standardized but the idea was that you should always be able to walk five minutes to ice cream which personally I think is a great idea.

636
01:23:46,493 --> 01:23:54,776
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, we've noticed that there's these scattered there's a little convenience store there's an upholster I think somewhere there's a little neighborhood cafe.

637
01:23:55,496 --> 01:24:09,000
[SPEAKER_02]: None of these to our knowledge are conforming now so the ability to make them conforming to allow further investment and then at kind of the appropriate cross points are or you know station along a longer street.

638
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:12,202
[SPEAKER_02]: where could these be to allow something like that to happen?

639
01:24:12,342 --> 01:24:25,810
[SPEAKER_02]: It's primarily about what's existing now because they're there, we want to make it easier for them, but also just sort of thinking through how are they used by the neighborhood and how do we make that a better thing to do?

640
01:24:28,793 --> 01:24:34,258
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that was cutting my eye was that they were usually very near a bus stop.

641
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:43,267
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are usually along the some kind of transit route, and usually exactly where the bus stop is.

642
01:24:44,048 --> 01:25:03,870
[SPEAKER_01]: So we will look at these areas where it makes geographically sense and it's a note of two streets that are a little bit more wide or that have a little bit more activity or is because he's next to a park so it makes sense that we have a little bit of opportunity for the ice cream or the cafe.

643
01:25:07,914 --> 01:25:08,515
[SPEAKER_15]: Great, thank you.

644
01:25:08,535 --> 01:25:09,656
[SPEAKER_15]: I think this is really exciting.

645
01:25:10,196 --> 01:25:11,798
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm really happy that this is being looked at.

646
01:25:11,898 --> 01:25:32,776
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that there are, certainly for myself, there are a lot of areas in the city where, you know, I have a very beloved, probably nonconforming use in my neighborhood, Collette Bakery, and a lot of times that I've been talking about this with city staff or just been walking down the road and thought, wow, what if this was the jumping off point for more little uses like this to be, you know,

647
01:25:33,777 --> 01:25:35,779
[SPEAKER_15]: useful to residents to bring people into the community.

648
01:25:35,839 --> 01:25:45,146
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think this is a really great jumping off point for looking at ways to make little, little conforming sub districts within the fabric of our residential districts.

649
01:25:45,747 --> 01:25:48,369
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that's the type of thing that residents have been asking us to look into.

650
01:25:49,270 --> 01:25:52,192
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll go to President Behrs and then Councilor Callahan.

651
01:25:53,453 --> 01:25:53,974
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

652
01:25:53,994 --> 01:25:57,837
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just, you know, just looking at these notes brought up some thoughts for me.

653
01:26:01,568 --> 01:26:10,333
[SPEAKER_03]: My first thinking is along the Broadway border between Medford and Somerville.

654
01:26:12,194 --> 01:26:15,756
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing I just think we, I mean, and obviously I think we'd get there once we have the drop zoning.

655
01:26:17,497 --> 01:26:21,259
[SPEAKER_03]: We should make sure that we're preserving the PDDs that have already happened.

656
01:26:21,419 --> 01:26:27,442
[SPEAKER_03]: So like there's this node at Winchester over to Alfred

657
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:38,626
[SPEAKER_03]: basically right near the ball square T logo, that long rectangular, that's I think the PDD2 or PDD3 that we've already proposed.

658
01:26:39,847 --> 01:26:51,094
[SPEAKER_03]: And it brought up another question for me, which is, and it might be for Alicia, where are we with the joint Somerville-Medford-Broadway zone?

659
01:26:51,294 --> 01:26:53,696
[SPEAKER_03]: And is that, do we want, is that gonna be a special zone?

660
01:26:53,716 --> 01:26:56,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we think that might actually fall under one of our

661
01:26:57,892 --> 01:26:59,255
[SPEAKER_03]: proposals for a corridor.

662
01:26:59,276 --> 01:27:03,506
[SPEAKER_03]: I just can't remember where we landed there.

663
01:27:14,024 --> 01:27:23,669
[SPEAKER_16]: So Madam Chair, for reasons I'm not clear, the final version of that report hasn't come out, but it's in a pretty finished way.

664
01:27:23,769 --> 01:27:30,572
[SPEAKER_16]: So I will send it over to our consultants, but it actually lends itself very heavily to a corridor.

665
01:27:30,592 --> 01:27:35,294
[SPEAKER_16]: And so we should look at how we create a corridor along there.

666
01:27:35,334 --> 01:27:42,158
[SPEAKER_16]: We have these little weird, when you look at, if you know where Broadway is there and you look at it, you can almost see little weird cutouts down there.

667
01:27:43,178 --> 01:27:53,661
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, but this idea of ground floor commercial and some levels floors of resident residential above the commercial is exactly the kind of stuff that we've been talking about.

668
01:27:54,081 --> 01:27:59,103
[SPEAKER_16]: And honestly, um, some of the other staff involved who are not

669
01:27:59,923 --> 01:28:05,868
[SPEAKER_16]: in Medford got very in the weeds and really into like the exact heights and stuff.

670
01:28:05,928 --> 01:28:10,251
[SPEAKER_16]: And so after a while I said, whichever four or six, like, just let me know.

671
01:28:12,312 --> 01:28:18,277
[SPEAKER_16]: Cause it didn't seem like that big of a deal, especially because there are many apartments over there of some real height.

672
01:28:20,038 --> 01:28:21,759
[SPEAKER_16]: So yeah, we'll grab that final.

673
01:28:22,220 --> 01:28:26,623
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, the version that we have, they kept tweaking some of the images.

674
01:28:27,318 --> 01:28:29,500
[SPEAKER_16]: and send it over to Emily.

675
01:28:29,700 --> 01:28:34,843
[SPEAKER_16]: At some point, I had suggested that those consultants reach out to you all, but it would have been like a year ago.

676
01:28:34,863 --> 01:28:38,106
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so we'll send it over.

677
01:28:39,947 --> 01:28:48,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, and Alicia, actually, maybe just before, also, we now have this application for the CAPI site.

678
01:28:49,293 --> 01:28:49,534
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

679
01:28:49,834 --> 01:28:55,678
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's another one of those, it's that node right over at the supercollider intersection at Wellington.

680
01:28:56,003 --> 01:29:02,929
[SPEAKER_16]: So to be clear, the CAPI site falls right now under our and it's interesting it's not really put on here.

681
01:29:03,509 --> 01:29:11,416
[SPEAKER_16]: So, our MBTA zone, the Wellington area MBTA zone is not highlighted on here.

682
01:29:11,996 --> 01:29:14,557
[SPEAKER_16]: it falls into that area just below the UR1.

683
01:29:16,057 --> 01:29:21,398
[SPEAKER_16]: The request from the CAPI site is actually very straightforward.

684
01:29:21,418 --> 01:29:28,239
[SPEAKER_16]: And one of the requests is directly in line with our recommendations and would have come in the cleanup stage.

685
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:33,921
[SPEAKER_16]: It's changing LEED certification from being certified to certify a BULB.

686
01:29:34,821 --> 01:29:37,201
[SPEAKER_16]: And we said to that lawyer, absolutely, we agree.

687
01:29:37,221 --> 01:29:40,322
[SPEAKER_16]: We would go eventually and change that.

688
01:29:40,902 --> 01:29:58,584
[SPEAKER_16]: The other is that we require buildings, not to be too far set back right so it has to be within 15 feet of the lot line it can't be way back floating, and they've actually produced an 1800s easement from the state of Massachusetts.

689
01:29:59,044 --> 01:30:07,929
[SPEAKER_16]: that requires that on one side of their property, they have to be set back at least 20 feet, and on the other side, at least 25 feet.

690
01:30:08,509 --> 01:30:23,417
[SPEAKER_16]: So what they provided was language that says that if there is an easement, and I think it may say an easement from the state, then that will actually supersede our zoning requirement that we would set it back that far, rather than the 15 feet.

691
01:30:24,738 --> 01:30:27,682
[SPEAKER_16]: And honestly, I'm not going to try and change a state's easement.

692
01:30:27,862 --> 01:30:35,272
[SPEAKER_16]: So it seems simpler to just say, yes, that makes sense, because it would allow a nice new multifamily building to go up there.

693
01:30:35,853 --> 01:30:36,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

694
01:30:36,133 --> 01:30:38,597
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's going to be under the overlay district.

695
01:30:38,677 --> 01:30:39,258
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what they're

696
01:30:39,666 --> 01:30:55,667
[SPEAKER_16]: So I don't think, and I think one thing that we should just sort of put our heads around is, do we actually just say this should just be applied to the whole West Medford, what Wellington can meet that I forgot what we called it the Wellington MBTA district.

697
01:30:56,143 --> 01:30:59,006
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, because if those requirements.

698
01:30:59,867 --> 01:31:02,551
[SPEAKER_16]: One of them we wanted to apply district wide anyhow.

699
01:31:03,292 --> 01:31:09,479
[SPEAKER_16]: And the other one if there are other properties with those easements which they their lawyer believes there may be.

700
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:13,604
[SPEAKER_16]: We might as well just cover ourselves now and say that.

701
01:31:14,125 --> 01:31:18,167
[SPEAKER_16]: if these easements exist, then the easement overrides our zoning.

702
01:31:19,328 --> 01:31:30,475
[SPEAKER_16]: So my feeling was not to make a special one parcel district, but actually for us to then just make an amendment to their request to make it blanket to the whole district.

703
01:31:32,536 --> 01:31:36,818
[SPEAKER_16]: And then you don't have another weird, another like hash mark thing.

704
01:31:37,359 --> 01:31:37,659
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

705
01:31:37,799 --> 01:31:39,320
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just want to note,

706
01:31:40,686 --> 01:31:50,221
[SPEAKER_03]: Like this is where I think the timeline that Vice President Collins has been talking about really comes in like we are doing stuff under the new zoning already because the new zoning is really

707
01:31:51,179 --> 01:31:54,141
[SPEAKER_03]: three years old now because we started with the recodification.

708
01:31:54,161 --> 01:32:02,246
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're now mapping over, and I think we should maybe look at Mystic Ave because I think we might have mapped over like the PDD one, and we need to look at that.

709
01:32:03,446 --> 01:32:16,815
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't remember if we... So I think that one might have been the second PDD and the Mystic Ave, but regardless... I know that... I will say that I believe that that one may be being abandoned, that property's for sale again, that... Yeah.

710
01:32:17,788 --> 01:32:23,330
[SPEAKER_16]: the property, the developer that came forward and requested that one on Mystic Ave.

711
01:32:23,550 --> 01:32:24,851
[SPEAKER_16]: And they're only good for two years.

712
01:32:24,891 --> 01:32:28,112
[SPEAKER_16]: You actually have to apply for your special permit within two years.

713
01:32:28,672 --> 01:32:31,913
[SPEAKER_16]: And so it's getting very close to timing out.

714
01:32:32,533 --> 01:32:45,838
[SPEAKER_16]: On the other hand, the other one that you mentioned earlier on Winchester Street, we met with that property owner last week, and they are getting ready to move forward with their project.

715
01:32:46,482 --> 01:32:54,626
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, those two, that and the Walkling PDD, just making sure that we're... Not losing them.

716
01:32:54,947 --> 01:33:03,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it just speaks to how if we continue to... We'll just end up in a more complicated situation if we don't complete this project in a timely manner.

717
01:33:03,912 --> 01:33:04,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

718
01:33:04,432 --> 01:33:08,334
[SPEAKER_16]: Yep, I think Emily has something to add.

719
01:33:13,578 --> 01:33:25,503
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did just want to clarify that the commercial areas that we called out there are the ones that are currently in neighborhood districts, which is why you're not seeing some of those things that are currently in commercial districts.

720
01:33:25,563 --> 01:33:28,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are still whited out at the moment.

721
01:33:28,525 --> 01:33:32,286
[SPEAKER_02]: So just for people looking here going, why am I not seeing X?

722
01:33:32,306 --> 01:33:33,167
[SPEAKER_02]: That may be why.

723
01:33:33,507 --> 01:33:38,109
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also happy to look at the PDD with the planning staff.

724
01:33:40,137 --> 01:33:43,581
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to add to that, this is not the proposal we are working.

725
01:33:43,621 --> 01:33:45,323
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just the analysis, right?

726
01:33:45,363 --> 01:33:52,352
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the current state and we will work where those notes could come and propose that.

727
01:33:56,757 --> 01:33:57,318
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you so much.

728
01:33:57,338 --> 01:33:58,759
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Kellyanne.

729
01:33:59,473 --> 01:34:01,194
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

730
01:34:01,214 --> 01:34:09,497
[SPEAKER_14]: So I so appreciate you looking into this and especially into where they these small commercial districts already exist in Medford.

731
01:34:10,878 --> 01:34:17,580
[SPEAKER_14]: I will say as we have gone through this whole zoning process, I think the thing I am most excited about is what I have been calling

732
01:34:19,121 --> 01:34:22,143
[SPEAKER_14]: community mixed use, which I think is exactly what we're talking about.

733
01:34:22,783 --> 01:34:43,515
[SPEAKER_14]: The idea, and I phrased it as, you know, within a half mile of every home, having a corner where people can go and there would be a space that was co-working by day, community events by night, there would be a cafe, there could be a bookstore, you know, a small grocery.

734
01:34:43,535 --> 01:34:47,857
[SPEAKER_14]: So all of these things, and I love the reframing that I

735
01:34:48,337 --> 01:34:49,859
[SPEAKER_14]: a five minute walk to an ice cream shop.

736
01:34:51,341 --> 01:34:52,662
[SPEAKER_14]: Everyone should be five minutes from ice cream.

737
01:34:53,063 --> 01:35:09,301
[SPEAKER_14]: So these things I think to me are what I'm the most excited is to really bring walkability and the neighborhood feeling and the idea that you're going to get to know your neighbors in this specific place that really is designed for you to meet the people who live

738
01:35:09,901 --> 01:35:14,104
[SPEAKER_14]: on your block, two blocks over near you.

739
01:35:14,464 --> 01:35:31,495
[SPEAKER_14]: And in part, what I am really hoping for is as I talk to people who have lived in Medford for a very long time, one of the things that they don't like about the changes that are happening is that they have known their neighbors their whole lives.

740
01:35:32,396 --> 01:35:38,500
[SPEAKER_14]: And they really feel this break with the people who are new here who aren't getting to know their neighbors.

741
01:35:39,240 --> 01:35:45,846
[SPEAKER_14]: That that is, is troublesome and, and I personally agree as someone who has moved often.

742
01:35:46,366 --> 01:35:48,588
[SPEAKER_14]: I wish that I knew my neighbors better.

743
01:35:48,608 --> 01:35:57,095
[SPEAKER_14]: I wish there was somewhere that I could go I mean for me it's Colette bakery, because, you know, we pass it every day that we go to school and so we stop in and we know people there.

744
01:35:57,415 --> 01:36:10,080
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think everyone should have a place, whether they have lived here for 50 years, or whether they just moved here, they should be able to walk somewhere that they will have an opportunity to get to know their neighbors.

745
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:12,341
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is very exciting to me.

746
01:36:13,061 --> 01:36:19,284
[SPEAKER_14]: And among the uses, I would love for us to consider children's and teens activities.

747
01:36:20,024 --> 01:36:27,629
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I think that is also something that I hear often from residents is that we don't have enough activities for families.

748
01:36:27,649 --> 01:36:39,216
[SPEAKER_14]: And if there were something that were walkable, especially teenagers, that's like a great opportunity to have something where teenagers can go and hang out, it's a safe space.

749
01:36:40,517 --> 01:36:45,941
[SPEAKER_14]: where they're a few blocks from home, they're very close by, and yet it's also designed for them.

750
01:36:46,021 --> 01:36:48,723
[SPEAKER_14]: So those are the kinds of considerations that I'm thinking of.

751
01:36:49,123 --> 01:36:56,729
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm hoping, I apologize if this was already sent out, but I got the full color maps of the

752
01:36:57,750 --> 01:37:09,857
[SPEAKER_14]: the proposed zoning and the existing use, but I didn't get the map of this one that has these existing commercial spots in the neighborhoods, and I would love to have that if that's possible.

753
01:37:10,957 --> 01:37:15,220
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll have those recirculated after the meeting and uploaded to the file for this meeting as well.

754
01:37:15,260 --> 01:37:15,500
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

755
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:16,180
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

756
01:37:17,781 --> 01:37:20,183
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, they're there as of this meeting on the 7th.

757
01:37:24,917 --> 01:37:26,819
[SPEAKER_02]: the power of the internet.

758
01:37:27,059 --> 01:37:28,640
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councillor, for those ideas.

759
01:37:29,161 --> 01:37:42,512
[SPEAKER_02]: We will work into those and look at how we define the types of spaces that would be appropriate for all ages in these neighborhoods, hubs, what they would mean in terms of dimensional standards as well and how they could interact.

760
01:37:42,572 --> 01:37:50,078
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be that we have different levels of neighborhood hub and activity depending on the corner size or the location or something.

761
01:37:50,118 --> 01:37:51,199
[SPEAKER_02]: But thank you for those ideas.

762
01:37:51,299 --> 01:37:52,000
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really helpful.

763
01:37:54,778 --> 01:38:01,636
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, I'm not surprised to see so much excitement around this agenda item of looking at the

764
01:38:03,974 --> 01:38:05,875
[SPEAKER_15]: in-district commercial nodes specifically.

765
01:38:05,915 --> 01:38:22,983
[SPEAKER_15]: I think this is something that a lot of residents have thought about or wondered about and asked for over the years, maybe using different language, but having walkable community hubs, places to get groceries, places to gather, places to get a bite to eat in a scale that's appropriate to residential neighborhoods.

766
01:38:24,603 --> 01:38:28,325
[SPEAKER_15]: We see so many of those all around Medford, you know, from North Medford down to South Medford.

767
01:38:29,346 --> 01:38:33,810
[SPEAKER_15]: and excited this process will reflect and give us some options for how to amplify that further.

768
01:38:37,971 --> 01:38:40,993
[SPEAKER_15]: So we've had a quite a robust discussion tonight.

769
01:38:41,093 --> 01:38:58,922
[SPEAKER_15]: I think talking about the sub districts that we've been workshopping for a couple of meetings now and getting a little bit more into the weeds on urban residential one and two counselors throughout several ideas for areas where we'd like to continue to see those boundaries reassessed in either direction.

770
01:39:00,583 --> 01:39:07,127
[SPEAKER_15]: And we've talked about some of the areas we've already changed the boundaries a little bit with neighborhood residential.

771
01:39:07,927 --> 01:39:09,768
[SPEAKER_15]: and seeing how those are playing out on the map.

772
01:39:09,908 --> 01:39:20,575
[SPEAKER_15]: Just to kind of briefly summarize here, we've also talked about how some of the corridors that are conspicuously absent from the neighborhood residential zoning map are because those will be considered later in the citywide process.

773
01:39:22,036 --> 01:39:34,283
[SPEAKER_15]: But at the same time, as we continue to move topic by topic, if, for example, there's something that we're thinking of discussing during a corridor discussion, that it then becomes very clear it should be a part of the abutting neighborhood zoning.

774
01:39:35,023 --> 01:39:36,284
[SPEAKER_15]: that change will happen.

775
01:39:36,684 --> 01:39:40,105
[SPEAKER_15]: We can do that kind of back and forth to make sure that things end up in the right place.

776
01:39:43,386 --> 01:39:46,647
[SPEAKER_15]: We talked about ADUs, which we have before.

777
01:39:46,727 --> 01:39:51,429
[SPEAKER_15]: Those are kind of a topic that is inside of the subdistrict process and also outside of it.

778
01:39:51,909 --> 01:39:53,610
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that there's a lot of work being done to

779
01:39:56,828 --> 01:40:03,832
[SPEAKER_15]: make sure that those are as allowed as we want them to be in the various sub-districts with the various by right conditions.

780
01:40:05,273 --> 01:40:18,101
[SPEAKER_15]: The next step in the neighborhood and urban residential process, I know we can expect from the zoning consultant a continually updated zoning map for our meeting in two weeks that reflects more of the requests for changes that we've made at this meeting.

781
01:40:19,022 --> 01:40:25,606
[SPEAKER_15]: And we're also gonna start talking in more specificity about dimensional requirements for each of these five sub-districts

782
01:40:26,686 --> 01:40:36,849
[SPEAKER_15]: Is it reasonable to expect that we can also talk a little bit more about one, the analysis of commercial nodes and residential districts?

783
01:40:39,710 --> 01:40:45,592
[SPEAKER_15]: And also, sorry, I just lost my train of thought, scrolling my notes too quickly.

784
01:40:50,483 --> 01:40:56,651
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, and the proposed language for waivers to protect, for example.

785
01:41:00,545 --> 01:41:16,251
[SPEAKER_15]: non-conforming single-family homes in new urban residential districts so that we can start looking at options to make sure that a recategorization there doesn't send projects to the ZBA unnecessarily and shields homeowners from that kind of administrative hassle.

786
01:41:16,811 --> 01:41:20,253
[SPEAKER_15]: Is it reasonable that those could be touched on at our next meeting again?

787
01:41:20,553 --> 01:41:21,253
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

788
01:41:26,781 --> 01:41:34,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Madam Chair, I think we can address both of those things at our next meeting, at least at the initial draft, get some feedback and then confirm it afterwards.

789
01:41:35,606 --> 01:41:36,526
[SPEAKER_15]: Great, excellent.

790
01:41:36,546 --> 01:41:41,289
[SPEAKER_15]: We get to have an initial draft of those topics to look at and respond to in two weeks.

791
01:41:45,691 --> 01:41:51,634
[SPEAKER_15]: Are there any additional comments or questions from councillors at this time on any of the topics that we've discussed tonight?

792
01:41:55,928 --> 01:41:58,812
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, seeing none, we'll go next to public participation.

793
01:42:00,134 --> 01:42:01,616
[SPEAKER_15]: Each participant will have three minutes.

794
01:42:01,896 --> 01:42:05,301
[SPEAKER_15]: I just request that you state your name and address for the record.

795
01:42:07,584 --> 01:42:08,445
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll ask to unmute you.

796
01:42:08,505 --> 01:42:11,129
[SPEAKER_15]: Judith, go ahead, just name and address for the record, please, and you have three minutes.

797
01:42:12,010 --> 01:42:13,471
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, my name is Judith Weinstock.

798
01:42:13,511 --> 01:42:16,274
[SPEAKER_11]: I live at 144 Burgett Avenue.

799
01:42:16,294 --> 01:42:18,756
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just want to get a little bit of clarification.

800
01:42:18,776 --> 01:42:20,177
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm really new to these maps.

801
01:42:20,257 --> 01:42:24,782
[SPEAKER_11]: And so they are, because they're so tiny, they're actually difficult to figure out.

802
01:42:25,422 --> 01:42:35,591
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's something that Alicia touched on when you were going through the new classification for the neighborhood in the hillside that abuts the T stop, the Medford

803
01:42:37,705 --> 01:42:44,749
[SPEAKER_11]: the Medford Tufts stop where it looks like and please, that's what I'm asking for some additional edification around.

804
01:42:45,389 --> 01:42:55,454
[SPEAKER_11]: It's being reclassified from a single family dwelling currently to an urban one, is that correct?

805
01:42:55,574 --> 01:43:03,118
[SPEAKER_11]: And that would mean that in the future, new single family homes would not be permitted in that area, is that correct?

806
01:43:13,213 --> 01:43:15,915
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't hear anybody, but hang on.

807
01:43:15,935 --> 01:43:18,977
[SPEAKER_15]: We're just negotiating where the microphone is.

808
01:43:19,157 --> 01:43:19,498
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

809
01:43:26,443 --> 01:43:26,683
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry.

810
01:43:29,787 --> 01:43:32,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes apologies we're sharing one mic among multiple people here.

811
01:43:33,391 --> 01:43:49,347
[SPEAKER_02]: So the answer is that urban residential one and urban residential to would not allow single family as a right so again not new single family is correct, where those apply where we're still discussing right we've made an initial presentation

812
01:43:50,188 --> 01:43:56,872
[SPEAKER_02]: where we think the boundaries might go and we're looking for input and feedback of whether or not we've got those in the right places at this point.

813
01:43:57,332 --> 01:44:13,822
[SPEAKER_02]: But that is correct for existing single family, we are looking at language that would prevent them having to go for waivers or common adjustments to single family homes so that they would not be, you know, the use of the single family would not be disrupted by the change.

814
01:44:14,843 --> 01:44:16,964
[SPEAKER_02]: But no new single families would be allowed.

815
01:44:17,024 --> 01:44:17,765
[SPEAKER_02]: That is correct.

816
01:44:18,225 --> 01:44:19,106
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I just want to

817
01:44:20,331 --> 01:44:27,256
[SPEAKER_11]: reiterate, I think what Alicia said, which is really this neighborhood is very, very strongly single family homes already.

818
01:44:28,477 --> 01:44:33,581
[SPEAKER_11]: So that would, I would think that, you know, we had a built, we have two homes being built now.

819
01:44:34,182 --> 01:44:39,106
[SPEAKER_11]: One is a replacement from a fire and one was replaced a couple of years ago as a knockdown.

820
01:44:39,886 --> 01:44:44,570
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm assuming that would no longer be allowed if this classification gets made.

821
01:44:50,166 --> 01:44:51,046
[SPEAKER_15]: Go to President Pierce.

822
01:44:51,306 --> 01:45:01,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and if you guys want to, you might be able to answer it as well, but there's a catastrophic incident that results in the destruction and the need for the reconstruction of the building.

823
01:45:02,251 --> 01:45:11,114
[SPEAKER_03]: You can build back to essentially the existing nonconformity that you had at the time, or rebuild the existing structure, the structure that existed before the catastrophe.

824
01:45:12,715 --> 01:45:17,477
[SPEAKER_03]: In terms of a knockdown rebuild, that might be different, I don't know.

825
01:45:18,527 --> 01:45:29,039
[SPEAKER_03]: What you guys think about that, like if someone was someone had a single family they tore it down they wanted to build a new single family in its place if we didn't have by right that might not be allowed.

826
01:45:34,263 --> 01:45:40,306
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we double check with legal counsel, but my understanding is it's an existing non-conforming use.

827
01:45:40,867 --> 01:45:43,268
[SPEAKER_02]: The use is not changing within two years.

828
01:45:43,288 --> 01:45:50,352
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it depends on the conditions under which it was knocked down and then rebuilt, but we can certainly look into that.

829
01:45:50,812 --> 01:45:59,937
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe again, as we look at the non-conformities, if there's not already a provision in state law or local ordinance, we can see if there's something we need to add to that.

830
01:46:00,703 --> 01:46:18,845
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and I just will add that these comments about existing conditions on the ground we've done a lot of checking from the air we've done a lot of we've been driving around we've been walking around, but everybody who is speaking knows Medford will always know about third better than consultants we appreciate these comments are very helpful to us.

831
01:46:19,465 --> 01:46:32,169
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I mean, I personally would just find it a little odd that you would allow every other use just about in this new UR category, but not allow single families in addition.

832
01:46:32,469 --> 01:46:33,789
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's all.

833
01:46:34,370 --> 01:46:34,790
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

834
01:46:37,071 --> 01:46:37,311
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

835
01:46:37,791 --> 01:46:38,811
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much, Judith.

836
01:46:41,612 --> 01:46:42,512
[SPEAKER_15]: Give me a second here.

837
01:46:42,532 --> 01:46:46,954
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you want to speak before the remainder of public comment?

838
01:46:47,054 --> 01:46:47,874
[SPEAKER_15]: Is it a direct response?

839
01:46:47,954 --> 01:46:48,014
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

840
01:46:49,021 --> 01:46:51,463
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll go to Councillor Kellyanne and then back to public participation.

841
01:46:56,588 --> 01:46:57,208
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you so much.

842
01:46:57,288 --> 01:46:59,270
[SPEAKER_14]: And I did want to just respond quickly.

843
01:46:59,290 --> 01:47:09,619
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the reason why this is one of the more major changes that is happening in the residential zoning is this very specific spot, because it was single family too.

844
01:47:10,460 --> 01:47:12,222
[SPEAKER_14]: And now we are changing it to

845
01:47:13,467 --> 01:47:14,407
[SPEAKER_14]: urban residential.

846
01:47:15,208 --> 01:47:23,990
[SPEAKER_14]: And the reason is because there's a brand new T stop that, you know, 10 years ago, did we even know 10 years ago that it was going to come to there?

847
01:47:24,030 --> 01:47:25,790
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe around 10 years ago?

848
01:47:25,830 --> 01:47:26,290
[SPEAKER_14]: We hoped.

849
01:47:26,470 --> 01:47:28,911
[SPEAKER_14]: But the zoning is 37 years old.

850
01:47:29,471 --> 01:47:36,353
[SPEAKER_14]: So like 37 years ago when this zoning was written, that T stop was not even a twinkling in the eye.

851
01:47:37,153 --> 01:47:40,055
[SPEAKER_14]: of the person who ended up planning the T stop.

852
01:47:40,455 --> 01:47:48,019
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is why this particular neighborhood is seeing such a change is because it really is right where that T stop is.

853
01:47:48,039 --> 01:47:51,822
[SPEAKER_14]: And the whole rest of the city is going to see much less change.

854
01:47:51,862 --> 01:48:00,207
[SPEAKER_14]: So I do understand that this, you know, for folks who live in this neighborhood, you know, we may want to have more discussions and really talk to them.

855
01:48:00,407 --> 01:48:02,408
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is also why I was, you know,

856
01:48:02,988 --> 01:48:24,671
[SPEAKER_14]: wanted to deeply ask these questions about like I want to make sure that single family homes, people who only have single family homes in this particular neighborhood are able to do with their homes, what every other single family homeowner can do in Medford, that I think is very important that they be able to do, you know, an ad you that they be able to, you know,

857
01:48:25,332 --> 01:48:28,573
[SPEAKER_14]: put on a porch or whatever it is that they want to do to their single family home.

858
01:48:29,053 --> 01:48:41,678
[SPEAKER_14]: I do not want people to, I think we already have too much turnover in this city, you know, because of the skyrocketing housing prices and the pressure on people to, you know, sell and move somewhere cheaper.

859
01:48:42,999 --> 01:48:46,820
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to make sure that the folks who currently live here is the people that we're serving.

860
01:48:47,900 --> 01:48:51,562
[SPEAKER_14]: But this is this one neighborhood is going to be the spot

861
01:48:52,002 --> 01:48:58,425
[SPEAKER_14]: that looks like in the zoning in terms of the residential neighborhoods does get the most change, and it is purely because of that T-stop.

862
01:49:02,446 --> 01:49:02,806
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

863
01:49:02,906 --> 01:49:03,387
[SPEAKER_15]: President Pierce?

864
01:49:03,927 --> 01:49:07,548
[SPEAKER_03]: I just think it's important to talk about not necessarily change, but potential change.

865
01:49:10,029 --> 01:49:12,870
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a lot of countervailing factors here.

866
01:49:12,910 --> 01:49:18,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I hear the argument of if it's going to be in most of the other places, why wouldn't you allow it here?

867
01:49:19,453 --> 01:49:21,214
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think there's a countervailing argument of

868
01:49:22,174 --> 01:49:34,561
[SPEAKER_03]: do you end up incentivizing, you know, very, very, very expensive single family homes that still don't conform to the existing nature of the neighborhood?

869
01:49:34,581 --> 01:49:48,008
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we've seen it in some places, like there's, I know I point to it often, but there's the house next to the West Bedford Community Center that is just a wild structure.

870
01:49:48,648 --> 01:49:49,449
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a really,

871
01:49:51,061 --> 01:50:01,436
[SPEAKER_03]: it's a giant single family box that doesn't, you know, that you could house a lot more than one family unit inside of a structure that large.

872
01:50:03,019 --> 01:50:04,721
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think it's important to talk about potential change.

873
01:50:04,761 --> 01:50:07,723
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree like the transit is certainly impactful here.

874
01:50:07,743 --> 01:50:23,077
[SPEAKER_03]: I think also noting that a lot of this zoning is really more like 60, 65 years old is important and a lot as with most of our neighborhoods, except for some of the newer single family subdivisions.

875
01:50:24,219 --> 01:50:27,162
[SPEAKER_03]: most of these structures existed before the zoning even existed.

876
01:50:27,462 --> 01:50:30,746
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's just something to think about as well.

877
01:50:30,986 --> 01:50:38,593
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I mean, I'm not, I've been personally when I look at this neighborhood really going back and forth between the idea of like, should this be an R3?

878
01:50:38,653 --> 01:50:39,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Should this be a UR1?

879
01:50:39,814 --> 01:50:42,297
[SPEAKER_03]: In my head, it goes back and forth a lot.

880
01:50:42,617 --> 01:50:42,797
[SPEAKER_03]: So

881
01:50:44,772 --> 01:50:57,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Certainly, I think your point, Councillor Callahan, about making sure that the people who have single family homes there now can continue to do with them if they want to stay with them, in them, what they want is important.

882
01:50:58,443 --> 01:51:12,095
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think there's an entire other side of this, which is allowing this, which is not allowed now, might enable someone to stay in the neighborhood because they can add a second unit to the house.

883
01:51:13,359 --> 01:51:28,711
[SPEAKER_03]: That can help them, you know, maybe they don't need the whole house as they age in place, you can add a second unit, you can rent that to someone that rental income subsidizes your fixed income retirement and I think like really thinking about this in all the different ways that

884
01:51:31,727 --> 01:51:43,337
[SPEAKER_03]: the property owner might make a decision that is important to think about too, because I don't think it's, and I'm not saying you're saying this, but I don't think it's as simple as saying, oh, we're going from this SF2 to this UR1, and that's a major change.

885
01:51:43,357 --> 01:51:51,084
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's saying, A, the existing zoning really doesn't entirely reflect what is there.

886
01:51:51,284 --> 01:51:56,369
[SPEAKER_03]: It certainly doesn't reflect the modern transit conditions or things that have happened in the intervening period.

887
01:51:57,375 --> 01:52:09,978
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of these zones, and I think to Judith's point, maybe this is where you go the other direction with it, are allowing a lot more options, giving the people who live there now a lot more options than they may otherwise have.

888
01:52:11,578 --> 01:52:23,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Part of the challenge of this whole thing is we can't control either collectively or individually or as a neighborhood what people want to do with their private property, right?

889
01:52:23,541 --> 01:52:25,241
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's, I think, where we run into

890
01:52:26,470 --> 01:52:28,812
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, we've heard it time and again, we heard it on Monday night.

891
01:52:29,772 --> 01:52:33,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Why didn't the city vet the people who applied for the methadone clinic?

892
01:52:34,656 --> 01:52:38,479
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's private property, a private provider and a private property.

893
01:52:38,899 --> 01:52:52,570
[SPEAKER_03]: The city doesn't have any, the city can only equally enforce the rules and laws that exist and regulations and the private entities that own the land or own the structures or wanna do something in those structures.

894
01:52:53,702 --> 01:52:57,206
[SPEAKER_03]: they get to make the choices they get to make because that's that's our system.

895
01:52:59,748 --> 01:53:09,177
[SPEAKER_03]: I could have a lot of long ideological conversations about why I think maybe we should look at some changes there but that's not where we're at and the state laws never going to allow us to

896
01:53:10,212 --> 01:53:34,403
[SPEAKER_03]: that applicants by the specific categories of what we think is a community benefit for you know who's a good private actor who's a bad private actor right it's not something that I think the state or federal government is going to let us do and I don't think it's something that we're looking at here so it's a compliment long story short I'm just talking for a while we've been here a long time and I should probably just stop but it's a long

897
01:53:35,647 --> 01:53:41,832
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a really complicated set of conditions that we're trying to set a balance with across all of this.

898
01:53:42,212 --> 01:53:47,377
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I agree this neighborhood has a there's potential impact for this neighborhood.

899
01:53:47,897 --> 01:53:48,838
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think there's also

900
01:53:49,885 --> 01:54:04,628
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, they're going to see the property values are going to increase their significantly because having a single family home that proximate to high frequency transit is going to raise assessments and that could also push people out or push people to sell.

901
01:54:05,108 --> 01:54:10,430
[SPEAKER_03]: So by allowing more options that might enable someone to stay in the neighborhood they want to stay in.

902
01:54:10,510 --> 01:54:15,691
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's, you know, there's so many ways that each individual property owner, um,

903
01:54:17,563 --> 01:54:42,349
[SPEAKER_03]: or resident is making the choices that they need to make and the way that the rules and laws impact them that I just want to try to be considerate of all of the potential plethora of choices that people might make as they try to live in what I completely agree with you is a really difficult circumstance of the economics of housing in Medford and in Boston.

904
01:54:47,890 --> 01:54:51,212
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you president bears and I appreciate the commenter who brought this up.

905
01:54:52,032 --> 01:54:53,753
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's a really important comment.

906
01:54:53,773 --> 01:54:57,395
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's one that as president bear said, we're continuing to consider.

907
01:54:57,435 --> 01:54:59,416
[SPEAKER_15]: This is not a final draft of this proposal yet.

908
01:54:59,436 --> 01:55:05,578
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to continue to receive public comment about this and continue to tweak as we go along.

909
01:55:06,579 --> 01:55:10,341
[SPEAKER_15]: Just one point that I do want to underline as we're talking about like what, why are the changes?

910
01:55:10,601 --> 01:55:13,802
[SPEAKER_15]: Why are we proposing changes and why are these the changes that we are proposing?

911
01:55:14,282 --> 01:55:14,803
[SPEAKER_15]: First, that

912
01:55:15,963 --> 01:55:27,276
[SPEAKER_15]: All of the sub-districts, the new sub-districts that are being proposed in this proposal reflect to some degree housing that is already on the ground in these areas.

913
01:55:29,911 --> 01:55:32,792
[SPEAKER_15]: And that and that informs why they've been categorized the way that they have been.

914
01:55:33,993 --> 01:55:42,856
[SPEAKER_15]: That doesn't preclude a conversation about you know what, what should the sub district, be what which type of existing residential housing should it most closely reflect that is a conversation we're going to keep having it.

915
01:55:44,277 --> 01:55:48,699
[SPEAKER_15]: But the other thing I just want to underline from the conversation with my fellow counselors is.

916
01:55:50,099 --> 01:55:56,581
[SPEAKER_15]: In this sub district and others like it that are so incredible that are so proximate to the brand new these year and a half old T stations.

917
01:55:56,661 --> 01:55:58,202
[SPEAKER_15]: These neighborhoods are going to see change.

918
01:55:59,362 --> 01:56:00,923
[SPEAKER_15]: Whether we update the zoning or not.

919
01:56:01,423 --> 01:56:10,306
[SPEAKER_15]: And this is a really important conversation that we get to have as a community to try to exert some control over what type of change we see and how to try to maximize community benefit from that change.

920
01:56:11,066 --> 01:56:14,767
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a conversation about do we want to see change in developers kind of

921
01:56:16,362 --> 01:56:25,669
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, I would make the argument that I'm very concerned about developers maxing out lot sizes and dimensionals to build very expensive single family homes that people in Medford cannot afford to buy and live in.

922
01:56:30,312 --> 01:56:43,222
[SPEAKER_15]: And so we can, I think that this conversation is around not will change happen or not, but what level of control, what levers do we want to use to try and exert our influence over making sure that that change is beneficial to the community.

923
01:56:46,723 --> 01:56:49,045
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, moving back to public participation.

924
01:56:50,786 --> 01:56:51,766
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll go back to Zoom.

925
01:56:51,886 --> 01:56:52,767
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll ask you to unmute.

926
01:56:53,527 --> 01:56:54,668
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address for the record, please.

927
01:56:54,688 --> 01:56:55,449
[SPEAKER_15]: You'll have three minutes.

928
01:56:55,969 --> 01:56:56,569
[SPEAKER_15]: Janie, go ahead.

929
01:56:56,589 --> 01:56:59,972
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi there.

930
01:57:00,152 --> 01:57:01,693
[SPEAKER_09]: I am Janie Tallarita.

931
01:57:01,793 --> 01:57:04,735
[SPEAKER_09]: I live at 68 Charnwood Road.

932
01:57:05,055 --> 01:57:09,658
[SPEAKER_09]: And I want to say thank you first off for all your hard work on this.

933
01:57:09,738 --> 01:57:12,720
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds like things are moving in a good direction.

934
01:57:12,740 --> 01:57:12,800
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm

935
01:57:13,872 --> 01:57:16,393
[SPEAKER_09]: feel its walkability is really important.

936
01:57:17,954 --> 01:57:25,057
[SPEAKER_09]: Multi-unit housing, having affordable housing and not McMansions and Medford is really important to me.

937
01:57:25,077 --> 01:57:35,202
[SPEAKER_09]: And I want to apologize in advance because my question may be coming up in two weeks, but I'm here now, so I'm going to throw it out there.

938
01:57:35,702 --> 01:57:37,403
[SPEAKER_09]: I live in Hillside.

939
01:57:37,903 --> 01:57:39,704
[SPEAKER_09]: We are a residential neighborhood.

940
01:57:41,264 --> 01:57:42,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Looking at the map,

941
01:57:42,964 --> 01:57:49,748
[SPEAKER_09]: hard to tell how Boston Ave relates to our neighborhood.

942
01:57:49,768 --> 01:58:03,275
[SPEAKER_09]: It is a multi-use area and much of it is owned by Tufts University, but it is very much

943
01:58:05,110 --> 01:58:08,673
[SPEAKER_09]: It is very much part of our community.

944
01:58:09,093 --> 01:58:17,199
[SPEAKER_09]: And we are all downhill from Boston Ave, so anything that is built there towers above us.

945
01:58:17,579 --> 01:58:28,027
[SPEAKER_09]: And my question is, Tufts is building a mammoth structure, two buildings, 10 stories high, taking up an entire block.

946
01:58:29,368 --> 01:58:31,770
[SPEAKER_09]: That's really going to have a lifelong

947
01:58:33,025 --> 01:58:37,606
[SPEAKER_09]: Impact on our neighborhood and I'm wondering going forward what?

948
01:58:38,486 --> 01:58:40,127
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm talking about dimensions here.

949
01:58:40,187 --> 01:58:45,228
[SPEAKER_09]: I know but What's what are what are your thoughts about that?

950
01:58:45,468 --> 01:58:46,348
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a way?

951
01:58:47,149 --> 01:58:48,369
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a dormitory.

952
01:58:48,469 --> 01:58:54,971
[SPEAKER_09]: So it is within zoning at that size, but it's just It's not right for this neighborhood.

953
01:58:55,051 --> 01:58:57,931
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm wondering what are the plans for?

954
01:58:58,111 --> 01:58:58,852
[SPEAKER_09]: addressing

955
01:59:02,364 --> 01:59:21,614
[SPEAKER_09]: Tufts being able to build, or anyone being able to build a dormitory of that size, and just generally how we can keep Boston a part of the Hillside community and not something that's destructive to it.

956
01:59:22,314 --> 01:59:23,735
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep it walkable.

957
01:59:24,135 --> 01:59:29,838
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep it a place that we all want to visit and all want to be part of and feel like it's part of our community.

958
01:59:32,994 --> 01:59:39,731
[SPEAKER_09]: It is, since the trees came down from the T line, it is very much part of us.

959
01:59:39,831 --> 01:59:42,758
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm hoping you understand my question there.

960
01:59:45,682 --> 01:59:49,626
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, thank you so much for the question, Janie, I think we all know exactly what you're talking about.

961
01:59:51,148 --> 02:00:04,363
[SPEAKER_15]: The Boston Ave corridor that isn't included on these maps will not be included as part of this proposal Boston Ave is one of the special cases in the city it's a corridor, it has all those really important kind of neighborhood specific elements that you mentioned.

962
02:00:05,244 --> 02:00:08,087
[SPEAKER_15]: the Proximity to Transit, Proximity to Hillsides, Proximity to Tufts.

963
02:00:08,107 --> 02:00:16,235
[SPEAKER_15]: So that will be considered later in the citywide zoning process so that we can give it kind of the like unique focus that it deserves.

964
02:00:16,255 --> 02:00:19,979
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'll go to President Behrs and then Ennis for more on that topic.

965
02:00:21,120 --> 02:00:24,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, thanks Vice President Collins and thanks Janie.

966
02:00:24,403 --> 02:00:26,025
[SPEAKER_03]: I think to your point,

967
02:00:28,277 --> 02:00:31,298
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things, I'm gonna hit a couple topics.

968
02:00:31,378 --> 02:00:34,279
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things was we heard from Tufts.

969
02:00:35,499 --> 02:00:36,579
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm even gonna back up a little bit more.

970
02:00:36,599 --> 02:00:40,680
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been talking a lot about the Salem Street zoning changes recently.

971
02:00:40,720 --> 02:00:45,542
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a Q&A session with some folks on Monday.

972
02:00:46,302 --> 02:00:53,364
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the things that we see now is that the way that the current zoning is structured, it allows

973
02:00:54,431 --> 02:00:57,313
[SPEAKER_03]: very different dimensional requirements based on use.

974
02:00:57,333 --> 02:01:08,563
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I'm correct, and I'm seeing some nods, Tufts justified some of their structure construction based on like what the underlying zoning would allow.

975
02:01:08,623 --> 02:01:14,548
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I'm correct, that's because the current existing city zoning for something like a dormitory

976
02:01:15,148 --> 02:01:20,492
[SPEAKER_03]: was falling under the other principle uses use which allowed very high heights.

977
02:01:21,052 --> 02:01:22,773
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's something we really want to fix.

978
02:01:23,374 --> 02:01:31,219
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and that's something we're trying to fix citywide, so that we can't have Tufts as an institution falling back on

979
02:01:33,263 --> 02:01:39,467
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess the best word I can use for it is strange or outdated or just broken zoning to justify what they did.

980
02:01:40,467 --> 02:01:47,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's the zoning now and was the zoning that they applied under, that was one of the reasons they were able to use that as a legal justification for what they built.

981
02:01:48,332 --> 02:01:58,257
[SPEAKER_03]: To build on what Vice President Collins was saying, one of the things we want to do is put in institutional zoning for Tufts, and that's something we've been talking about.

982
02:02:00,773 --> 02:02:08,637
[SPEAKER_03]: And part of this project that gets a little bit difficult is there's the larger neighborhood of like Hillside, right?

983
02:02:08,957 --> 02:02:20,323
[SPEAKER_03]: And a big chunk of it is the residential stuff that we're talking about right now, but it also incorporates the mixed uses along Boston Avenue and it incorporates this institution Tufts.

984
02:02:20,964 --> 02:02:26,327
[SPEAKER_03]: And likely what we would see is three different zoning types or maybe a mix, even a little bit more of zoning types

985
02:02:27,107 --> 02:02:33,173
[SPEAKER_03]: in the neighborhood, but specifically designed towards your point of trying to control for these questions.

986
02:02:33,794 --> 02:02:50,271
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you ask me, certainly one of the things that residents were who had been a little confused on Salem Street were I think more encouraged by was noting like right now the zoning because of how it's structured, you can build a 15 story hotel on Salem Street.

987
02:02:50,751 --> 02:02:57,277
[SPEAKER_03]: nobody wants a 15-story hotel on Salem Street, and the new zoning we're proposing would make that impossible.

988
02:02:57,297 --> 02:03:04,783
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's the kind of some of, it's an example of the changes that we're talking about when it comes to an institutional zone for Tufts.

989
02:03:05,304 --> 02:03:13,291
[SPEAKER_03]: And also on Salem Street, we've built in some step backs and setback requirements to try to maintain light.

990
02:03:13,771 --> 02:03:17,795
[SPEAKER_03]: I think when we're looking at the Boston Avenue corridor and its topographical arrangement,

991
02:03:18,355 --> 02:03:29,437
[SPEAKER_03]: being above the residential neighborhood below, we'd want to factor in neighborhood specific elements to whatever's going on to Boston Ave to also address questions like that.

992
02:03:29,977 --> 02:03:42,100
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're probably not going to talk about those specific zones and changes as part of this proposal, because this proposal is really about the residential district.

993
02:03:42,600 --> 02:03:42,800
[SPEAKER_03]: But

994
02:03:43,818 --> 02:03:44,559
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm thinking about it.

995
02:03:44,599 --> 02:03:45,739
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're all thinking about it.

996
02:03:45,779 --> 02:04:02,850
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm seeing nods from the consultants and planning staff that they're thinking about it because we don't want, the whole point of this is to get zoning that can't be, that you don't have people running through loopholes to build things that we don't think have community benefit the way that we want them to be done.

997
02:04:05,731 --> 02:04:06,852
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll just leave it at that.

998
02:04:06,912 --> 02:04:09,033
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're definitely talking and thinking about it.

999
02:04:09,093 --> 02:04:11,535
[SPEAKER_03]: I think some of the questions you're asking are about

1000
02:04:13,162 --> 02:04:17,828
[SPEAKER_03]: probably around the Boston Avenue corridor and then also an institutional district for Tufts.

1001
02:04:18,349 --> 02:04:29,744
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's definitely going to be priority for me as a counselor that we fix these broken elements of our zoning to avoid outcomes like what we saw earlier last week.

1002
02:04:30,205 --> 02:04:30,866
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.

1003
02:04:32,051 --> 02:04:35,293
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, President bears will go next to Emily.

1004
02:04:35,713 --> 02:04:47,739
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Madam Chair, I just want to confirm, we heard concerns on Salem Street on Monday about air and light we have already started discussing internally some studies we can do to just make

1005
02:04:48,419 --> 02:04:50,181
[SPEAKER_02]: sure that our dimensional standards work.

1006
02:04:50,221 --> 02:04:52,022
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they don't, that we would change them.

1007
02:04:52,383 --> 02:05:02,371
[SPEAKER_02]: We have also throughout this process of discussing the residential areas, we've been discussing areas that are affected by the change in topography in Medford throughout the city.

1008
02:05:02,912 --> 02:05:04,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing with Boston Avenue.

1009
02:05:04,253 --> 02:05:12,280
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we would extend the type of studies we're contemplating for Salem Street to that area as well to just double check that any recommendations we make

1010
02:05:12,841 --> 02:05:15,804
[SPEAKER_02]: are not having an undue impact on the neighborhoods around them.

1011
02:05:15,925 --> 02:05:17,967
[SPEAKER_02]: So we will continue to do that as it's brought up.

1012
02:05:18,047 --> 02:05:20,871
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thank the speaker for bringing this to our attention.

1013
02:05:25,037 --> 02:05:25,257
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

1014
02:05:25,497 --> 02:05:25,938
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you again.

1015
02:05:28,197 --> 02:05:30,198
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, we will continue with public participation.

1016
02:05:30,218 --> 02:05:36,541
[SPEAKER_15]: I will go to the person who's been patiently standing at the podium, and then we will go back to our speakers on Zoom.

1017
02:05:39,082 --> 02:05:39,782
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address.

1018
02:05:40,483 --> 02:05:41,603
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, just click the button.

1019
02:05:42,003 --> 02:05:42,724
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll turn the mic on.

1020
02:05:43,524 --> 02:05:43,724
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

1021
02:05:43,984 --> 02:05:44,945
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address for the record.

1022
02:05:45,005 --> 02:05:45,725
[SPEAKER_15]: You have three minutes.

1023
02:05:46,245 --> 02:05:48,967
[SPEAKER_12]: William Navar, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

1024
02:05:50,007 --> 02:05:51,728
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much for the suggestion.

1025
02:05:51,748 --> 02:05:56,070
[SPEAKER_12]: I very much agree with the Medford-Made-Broadway triangle.

1026
02:05:56,595 --> 02:06:00,437
[SPEAKER_12]: could really go into the higher urban district that we learned about today.

1027
02:06:03,319 --> 02:06:14,745
[SPEAKER_12]: I wonder if it, I haven't done the analysis, but maybe the consultants could look at extending that a bit more to the east, where it gets really close to the Winter Hill type territory.

1028
02:06:15,525 --> 02:06:20,468
[SPEAKER_12]: Not 100% sure about that, but based on my look at the map, it looks like it might make sense.

1029
02:06:23,289 --> 02:06:24,690
[SPEAKER_12]: Sort of the area to the,

1030
02:06:26,615 --> 02:06:32,756
[SPEAKER_12]: to the east of Mitsitak School in Columbus Park, that sort of zone I'm talking about.

1031
02:06:32,776 --> 02:06:36,197
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a question.

1032
02:06:36,257 --> 02:06:38,017
[SPEAKER_12]: It's probably fairly easy to answer.

1033
02:06:39,117 --> 02:06:47,299
[SPEAKER_12]: When we talk about allowing a little more height, and we're concerned about the pitched roofs, is there any reason to not go to 3.5 stories?

1034
02:06:47,359 --> 02:06:51,939
[SPEAKER_12]: I know at three, that might be a special number for building code or something like that.

1035
02:06:51,999 --> 02:06:53,720
[SPEAKER_12]: So is that basically the reasoning?

1036
02:06:55,120 --> 02:06:56,000
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a question.

1037
02:06:56,982 --> 02:07:06,469
[SPEAKER_12]: Another thing I'll say is I very much agree with Councillor Beers concern about, you know, giant monster single family homes coming in where we used to have a small bungalow kind of thing.

1038
02:07:07,309 --> 02:07:21,380
[SPEAKER_12]: One thing I'll say about that is that per unit parking mandates, I think are going to continue to keep that a lot more tempting than a department because you may not be able to fit the parking on if you require it at a per unit basis.

1039
02:07:22,200 --> 02:07:24,382
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think that's something that should

1040
02:07:25,239 --> 02:07:28,362
[SPEAKER_12]: come back up when we talk about parking in a few weeks.

1041
02:07:30,584 --> 02:07:35,668
[SPEAKER_12]: And the last thing is, brought up Harvard Street earlier.

1042
02:07:35,688 --> 02:07:39,571
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that's one of the noisiest streets I know of.

1043
02:07:39,591 --> 02:07:45,596
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I thought I lived in a noisy area, but if I'm going to Wegmans or something, I make sure I don't walk on Harvard Street.

1044
02:07:45,636 --> 02:07:52,963
[SPEAKER_12]: It's very noisy, very unpleasant to walk on, probably the worst in the whole community in terms of the traffic noise.

1045
02:07:53,959 --> 02:07:57,561
[SPEAKER_12]: So, and I'm talking really to the east of Main Street.

1046
02:07:57,581 --> 02:08:06,046
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if there's anything in the zoning that could, you know, help allow, you know, property owners to mitigate that for the residents that live there.

1047
02:08:07,027 --> 02:08:16,393
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, you know, talk about the commercial nodes, like maybe you could put like accessory commercial use or something in front of the residents, shield some of the noise or something.

1048
02:08:16,413 --> 02:08:20,315
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know, but any creative solutions to address that.

1049
02:08:21,416 --> 02:08:23,517
[SPEAKER_12]: I think about that particular corridor, I think that would be a,

1050
02:08:24,250 --> 02:08:25,211
[SPEAKER_12]: neat thing to think about.

1051
02:08:25,231 --> 02:08:26,232
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1052
02:08:32,239 --> 02:08:32,479
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

1053
02:08:32,659 --> 02:08:33,180
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, William.

1054
02:08:34,481 --> 02:08:37,364
[SPEAKER_15]: Any directed responses on that or we can go on to the next speaker?

1055
02:08:41,413 --> 02:08:50,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Madam Chair, I don't think we have any direct response at this point but we're happy to look at the issues that were raised and see if there's anything that we can consider within the zoning.

1056
02:08:51,281 --> 02:09:00,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a reminder to that you know zoning doesn't solve all problems so we we do our best to see what we can consider and add to the project.

1057
02:09:01,630 --> 02:09:02,731
[SPEAKER_15]: Great, thank you very much.

1058
02:09:07,402 --> 02:09:09,663
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, quickly to President Behrs, then back to public participation.

1059
02:09:09,924 --> 02:09:12,525
[SPEAKER_03]: It might just be a question that we come back to when we talk about parking.

1060
02:09:14,166 --> 02:09:21,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Does the states kind of singling out of a single family and giving it some preferential status?

1061
02:09:23,790 --> 02:09:32,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Could a three-unit building have a three parking space limit, but a single family in the same district have

1062
02:09:35,598 --> 02:09:36,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Could you treat the units differently?

1063
02:09:36,858 --> 02:09:46,681
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know if you'd have the answer to that now or if it's something we'd have to think about for, but can you treat a unit in a single family different from a unit in a three family when it comes to parking if it's in the same district?

1064
02:09:47,981 --> 02:09:51,822
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have to check with our legal consultant.

1065
02:09:52,002 --> 02:10:00,344
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not believe that there's a protection for parking restrictions for single family, but that's something that I would want to check on a legal basis.

1066
02:10:00,724 --> 02:10:01,484
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't recall that.

1067
02:10:01,544 --> 02:10:04,245
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not one of the projections, I recall.

1068
02:10:06,048 --> 02:10:07,909
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen that differentiation.

1069
02:10:07,969 --> 02:10:17,794
[SPEAKER_01]: I have seen and not in Massachusetts, so I don't know if that's possible, but I've seen difference in the size of the units.

1070
02:10:18,335 --> 02:10:22,997
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it's a one, a studio will only have one parking requirement.

1071
02:10:23,397 --> 02:10:28,598
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's a three bedroom would have one and a half, so it would depend on the size.

1072
02:10:29,018 --> 02:10:30,398
[SPEAKER_01]: That distinction I have seen.

1073
02:10:31,198 --> 02:10:36,299
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen in any here in Massachusetts, but I have done.

1074
02:10:36,519 --> 02:10:37,279
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I have seen that.

1075
02:10:41,160 --> 02:10:41,860
[SPEAKER_15]: Great, thank you.

1076
02:10:42,680 --> 02:10:44,701
[SPEAKER_15]: We will go next back to Zoom.

1077
02:10:45,521 --> 02:10:47,581
[SPEAKER_15]: Gaston, just your name and address for the record, please.

1078
02:10:47,621 --> 02:10:48,381
[SPEAKER_15]: You have three minutes.

1079
02:10:50,102 --> 02:10:51,022
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

1080
02:10:51,102 --> 02:10:52,302
[SPEAKER_10]: Gaston Fierro, 61 Stigney Road.

1081
02:10:53,457 --> 02:10:58,659
[SPEAKER_10]: First, I had a question for Director Hunt on what constitutes new construction.

1082
02:10:58,779 --> 02:11:12,664
[SPEAKER_10]: My understanding is that oversimplifying rules, if you happen to modify your single family home by more than 50%, that could constitute new construction.

1083
02:11:12,824 --> 02:11:14,265
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that correct in Medford?

1084
02:11:15,645 --> 02:11:16,886
[SPEAKER_10]: Oversimplifying the rules.

1085
02:11:24,097 --> 02:11:30,623
[SPEAKER_16]: So I really think that we have to defer questions that are that level of detail to the building commissioner as to what is considered.

1086
02:11:30,884 --> 02:11:34,447
[SPEAKER_16]: Because obviously, if somebody is building from the ground up, it's new construction.

1087
02:11:34,847 --> 02:11:40,473
[SPEAKER_16]: But there is a point in which a renovation becomes new construction per the building code.

1088
02:11:40,913 --> 02:11:43,155
[SPEAKER_16]: And building code and zoning are different.

1089
02:11:43,776 --> 02:11:47,259
[SPEAKER_16]: And so whether it's being considered new construction for zoning,

1090
02:11:48,080 --> 02:11:51,681
[SPEAKER_16]: versus whether it's new construction for building, it's all very contextual.

1091
02:11:52,141 --> 02:11:54,482
[SPEAKER_16]: And so it's not a simple yes or no question.

1092
02:11:56,082 --> 02:11:56,982
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, thank you.

1093
02:11:57,002 --> 02:11:58,062
[SPEAKER_10]: That was helpful.

1094
02:11:59,183 --> 02:12:00,583
[SPEAKER_10]: That was helpful nonetheless.

1095
02:12:00,683 --> 02:12:13,666
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think we should definitely clarify that because I'm also very concerned about the urban residential zoning around the TAS Greenline T station.

1096
02:12:14,962 --> 02:12:19,203
[SPEAKER_10]: related to the existing non-conforming single-family homes.

1097
02:12:20,384 --> 02:12:27,386
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just think that a knockdown was mentioned, but that does not necessarily mean new construction.

1098
02:12:27,566 --> 02:12:35,909
[SPEAKER_10]: It could be that someone that is renovating their house substantially, that could also be considered new construction.

1099
02:12:36,009 --> 02:12:39,770
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think we should clarify that because

1100
02:12:40,538 --> 02:12:46,402
[SPEAKER_10]: I wouldn't be surprised at all that the government, in this case, the city council, would be making my life harder.

1101
02:12:46,802 --> 02:13:01,193
[SPEAKER_10]: For example, if I wanted to renovate my house rather than simplifying it, but I think that we're not very careful on the waivers that would need to be implemented to protect non-conforming single-family homes.

1102
02:13:02,073 --> 02:13:10,179
[SPEAKER_10]: This would constitute an inordinate increase in bureaucratic red tape for existing residents of that neighborhood.

1103
02:13:10,977 --> 02:13:13,099
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think we should keep that in mind.

1104
02:13:13,399 --> 02:13:14,080
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

1105
02:13:16,021 --> 02:13:35,878
[SPEAKER_16]: So that is something that I'm sure that we talked about is how do we codify protections for owners, but we do really need to be careful between the difference between a resident who lives there who wants to make, you know, reasonable changes to their house and then somebody else who buys it simply for the purpose of then

1106
02:13:36,498 --> 02:13:38,020
[SPEAKER_16]: changing it dramatically.

1107
02:13:38,160 --> 02:13:42,303
[SPEAKER_16]: So we have seen in the past builders who say, oh, this is just a renovation.

1108
02:13:42,324 --> 02:13:48,389
[SPEAKER_16]: And then they proceed to piece by piece completely turn over the entire building.

1109
02:13:48,830 --> 02:13:51,232
[SPEAKER_16]: That is new construction under building code.

1110
02:13:51,872 --> 02:13:56,256
[SPEAKER_16]: And we now have inspectors who catch that and stop it when they see it happening.

1111
02:13:57,798 --> 02:14:14,310
[SPEAKER_16]: we need to understand sort of like what would be like at what point should somebody who's living there not be able to double the size of their house and turn it into a McMansion just like if it was a flipper, a developer, sorry, who was doing that to that property.

1112
02:14:14,330 --> 02:14:16,952
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that's part of what we sort of need to think about.

1113
02:14:17,372 --> 02:14:21,896
[SPEAKER_16]: We certainly want to put in protections for a homeowner who's renovating their bathroom or

1114
02:14:22,316 --> 02:14:32,181
[SPEAKER_16]: bumping out one wall and adding some space or adding a dormer or a second floor to a single story house.

1115
02:14:33,342 --> 02:14:40,185
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to need to look into it more deeply and we'll make sure to include the building commissioner and our legal counsel on that language.

1116
02:14:41,286 --> 02:14:42,486
[SPEAKER_15]: Great, thank you, Director Hunt.

1117
02:14:42,506 --> 02:14:48,868
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, we'll be sure to collaborate closely with the building commissioner on that question.

1118
02:14:49,008 --> 02:15:10,913
[SPEAKER_15]: And as we discussed, I think for quite a long time earlier this meeting, as we're talking about recategorizing residential districts, I think that there's very shared consensus around not wanting to make your very normal, very regular renovations difficult for homeowners just because of the sub-district that they happen to be zoned in.

1119
02:15:11,833 --> 02:15:20,939
[SPEAKER_15]: And at the same time, we want to be using careful and nuanced language so that we're also closing loopholes through which developers would take advantage of our neighborhoods.

1120
02:15:22,080 --> 02:15:23,821
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you so much for flagging that.

1121
02:15:25,402 --> 02:15:25,702
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1122
02:15:26,222 --> 02:15:26,983
[SPEAKER_15]: Proceeding along.

1123
02:15:28,304 --> 02:15:29,885
[SPEAKER_15]: Cheryl, name and address for the record, please.

1124
02:15:29,905 --> 02:15:30,445
[SPEAKER_15]: You have three minutes.

1125
02:15:31,874 --> 02:15:33,355
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, my name is Cheryl Rodriguez.

1126
02:15:33,415 --> 02:15:34,716
[SPEAKER_00]: I live at 21 Park street.

1127
02:15:35,057 --> 02:15:41,242
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed at the beginning, you showed an item from the comp plan about allowing multifamily into different zoning districts.

1128
02:15:41,442 --> 02:15:58,096
[SPEAKER_00]: But the last two meetings I've watched you bend yourself into pretzels to protect West, despite the commuter rail and the buses and the Lawrence estates while pushing a heavier burden onto other denser areas, including Salem street, which is already facing six story buildings, which are out of character for our area.

1129
02:15:58,489 --> 02:16:09,952
[SPEAKER_00]: with a lot of waivers baked in to pull out the protections for the neighborhood, as well as allowing much higher on side streets than is reflected currently without having significant transit, just one bus.

1130
02:16:10,432 --> 02:16:22,195
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not within walking distance of the T or major bus hubs and some who were spare density and had the city council pushing to ensure their neighborhood character would not be disturbed.

1131
02:16:22,875 --> 02:16:25,978
[SPEAKER_00]: So you clearly know that you are disrupting our neighborhoods.

1132
02:16:26,438 --> 02:16:28,380
[SPEAKER_00]: Just some are less worthy of care.

1133
02:16:28,920 --> 02:16:34,885
[SPEAKER_00]: And reducing zoning barriers is also limited to denser areas with smaller lots and much of your proposal.

1134
02:16:35,406 --> 02:16:37,087
[SPEAKER_00]: Setting up tiers of neighborhoods.

1135
02:16:37,548 --> 02:16:40,370
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are we not limited to small infill housing?

1136
02:16:40,630 --> 02:16:42,272
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we have already done our part.

1137
02:16:42,812 --> 02:16:50,479
[SPEAKER_00]: This committee comes off very nimby for those deemed worthy of quality of life, but not one moment was used to consider our neighborhood.

1138
02:16:51,159 --> 02:16:54,022
[SPEAKER_00]: South of Sound Street is clusters of singles.

1139
02:16:54,522 --> 02:16:56,184
[SPEAKER_00]: NR3 is too much there.

1140
02:16:56,924 --> 02:17:05,252
[SPEAKER_00]: If the city overwhelmingly wants more density, as you claim, then catch up the other parts of the city with large lots and plenty of parking.

1141
02:17:05,772 --> 02:17:19,110
[SPEAKER_00]: A neighborhood that wasn't likely even a part of the writing of the comprehensive plan does not owe it to much less dense areas to continually lower our quality of life and increase heat islands with the highest density.

1142
02:17:19,745 --> 02:17:25,851
[SPEAKER_00]: You are treating us like we are just revenue and other areas are too special to share the burden of density.

1143
02:17:26,291 --> 02:17:29,554
[SPEAKER_00]: The consultants and the planning department decided on the quarters.

1144
02:17:30,014 --> 02:17:32,416
[SPEAKER_00]: No one who lives over here asked for quarters.

1145
02:17:32,957 --> 02:17:39,663
[SPEAKER_00]: We are doing more than our part to add housing and shouldn't have to shoulder burden that belongs to other parts of the city.

1146
02:17:40,143 --> 02:17:45,949
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you even studied the impact on a neighborhood facing the N3 zoning and the quarter zoning?

1147
02:17:46,549 --> 02:17:49,193
[SPEAKER_00]: We are continuously told density is good.

1148
02:17:49,574 --> 02:17:56,644
[SPEAKER_00]: So why do you feel the need to protect those with more space to the further degradation of our tight neighborhoods?

1149
02:17:57,285 --> 02:18:01,231
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our second turn and you seem to be coming back to us in May.

1150
02:18:01,851 --> 02:18:03,692
[SPEAKER_00]: What other neighborhoods will face this?

1151
02:18:04,072 --> 02:18:05,092
[SPEAKER_00]: Only the most dense?

1152
02:18:05,692 --> 02:18:09,254
[SPEAKER_00]: This goes against the comp plan and climate resiliency plan.

1153
02:18:09,614 --> 02:18:15,016
[SPEAKER_00]: So stop saying you are selecting winning and losing neighborhoods because of the comp plan.

1154
02:18:15,516 --> 02:18:21,238
[SPEAKER_00]: Those who participated in that process were mostly from areas being spared now.

1155
02:18:21,898 --> 02:18:23,759
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want it, give it to them.

1156
02:18:24,379 --> 02:18:28,660
[SPEAKER_00]: You claim it's a good thing, so why not give them a healthy share of this good?

1157
02:18:29,821 --> 02:18:30,201
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1158
02:18:34,110 --> 02:18:35,151
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for your comment, Cheryl.

1159
02:18:35,812 --> 02:18:36,973
[SPEAKER_15]: Appreciate your participation.

1160
02:18:36,993 --> 02:18:51,668
[SPEAKER_15]: While I disagree with some of the characterization, I will just note that in the neighborhood and urban residential proposal, the maximum height in all the sub-districts is three stories.

1161
02:18:52,048 --> 02:18:58,775
[SPEAKER_15]: And in the current Salem Street corridor district proposal, the maximum by right height is also three stories.

1162
02:19:01,080 --> 02:19:02,521
[SPEAKER_15]: We will go next to Jimmy.

1163
02:19:03,282 --> 02:19:04,142
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll ask you to unmute.

1164
02:19:04,222 --> 02:19:05,443
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address for the record, please.

1165
02:19:05,463 --> 02:19:06,044
[SPEAKER_15]: You have three minutes.

1166
02:19:06,064 --> 02:19:12,809
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, Jimmy, I've asked you to unmute.

1167
02:19:12,829 --> 02:19:20,835
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, I'll try one more time.

1168
02:19:28,353 --> 02:19:30,956
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, I see your hand is still raised, but you're still muted.

1169
02:19:32,838 --> 02:19:35,140
[SPEAKER_15]: So try to go off mute.

1170
02:19:37,182 --> 02:19:39,585
[SPEAKER_15]: If you can, we'll come back to you.

1171
02:19:40,726 --> 02:19:41,967
[SPEAKER_15]: Just in the next couple minutes if you can.

1172
02:19:43,008 --> 02:19:45,371
[SPEAKER_15]: Seeing no further public participation.

1173
02:19:50,543 --> 02:19:53,290
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you all so much for a very substantive conversation.

1174
02:19:53,610 --> 02:19:56,738
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilors, consultants, city staff, and residents alike.

1175
02:19:59,558 --> 02:20:05,983
[SPEAKER_15]: We had a long and substantive conversation on the updated neighborhood and urban residential topics tonight.

1176
02:20:06,624 --> 02:20:15,731
[SPEAKER_15]: So just to again reiterate we're going to meet on this topic again in two weeks that will be our fourth meeting on this topic, which is great.

1177
02:20:16,011 --> 02:20:21,336
[SPEAKER_15]: There is a lot here we're continuing to finesse the boundaries between the various between the various sub districts.

1178
02:20:22,396 --> 02:20:24,537
[SPEAKER_15]: which we will continue to do after this meeting.

1179
02:20:24,557 --> 02:20:36,402
[SPEAKER_15]: We are continuing to discuss the kind of accessory ramifications such as ADUs that go along with the various sub-districts.

1180
02:20:36,502 --> 02:20:41,985
[SPEAKER_15]: We've had a long discussion about the wanting to see options for the waivers we can build in for

1181
02:20:43,366 --> 02:20:55,054
[SPEAKER_15]: housing types that might become non-conforming should the proposed zoning go forward so we can make sure that people can retain the advantages of their current housing, even if the zone is to change around them.

1182
02:20:56,375 --> 02:21:05,161
[SPEAKER_15]: And at our next meeting on the topic, among other things, among other updates to the map, we are also going to talk about dimensional requirements for the first time.

1183
02:21:07,615 --> 02:21:11,679
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think I see that the, I think I see that Jimmy is back.

1184
02:21:11,699 --> 02:21:15,762
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're going to try for that public participation one more time and then entertain motions.

1185
02:21:17,063 --> 02:21:19,125
[SPEAKER_15]: Jimmy, if you can unmute now, just name and the record.

1186
02:21:19,866 --> 02:21:21,587
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, sorry about that.

1187
02:21:21,627 --> 02:21:22,608
[SPEAKER_15]: And you have three minutes.

1188
02:21:22,829 --> 02:21:23,129
[SPEAKER_15]: Go ahead.

1189
02:21:23,149 --> 02:21:23,289
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep.

1190
02:21:23,409 --> 02:21:23,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1191
02:21:24,130 --> 02:21:25,871
[SPEAKER_04]: So my name is James.

1192
02:21:27,838 --> 02:21:32,001
[SPEAKER_04]: I am a former Medford resident for almost 25 years.

1193
02:21:32,101 --> 02:21:34,283
[SPEAKER_04]: I work in Medford at 10 Revere Beach Parkway.

1194
02:21:34,723 --> 02:21:36,344
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the general manager at Cappy's.

1195
02:21:36,904 --> 02:21:41,267
[SPEAKER_04]: My wife grew up in Medford, my parents are from Medford, and my sister lives in Medford.

1196
02:21:42,548 --> 02:21:45,290
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been a long-term, I've lived in Medford from 1996 to 2017.

1197
02:21:48,072 --> 02:21:50,514
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a question for the council in regards to the zoning.

1198
02:21:51,775 --> 02:22:10,750
[SPEAKER_04]: As a younger person who was a longtime Medford resident, I was pushed out due to the fact that we do not have affordable housing in Medford for residents like myself, my wife, or even my sister who is now a Medford resident paying $4,000 for a two-bedroom apartment here in Medford at Wellington Circle.

1199
02:22:11,436 --> 02:22:17,281
[SPEAKER_04]: My question is with these zoning changes, will there be a mandate for more affordable housing in the city?

1200
02:22:17,962 --> 02:22:26,069
[SPEAKER_04]: And if so, what will be the protections for affordable housing when the median, uh, studio apartment here in Medford is at minimum $1,700.

1201
02:22:26,589 --> 02:22:32,814
[SPEAKER_04]: And I now live in New Hampshire where I'm paying 1,800 for a two bedroom.

1202
02:22:33,255 --> 02:22:38,239
[SPEAKER_04]: And I drive 60 miles every day because I love the city and I love working in the city.

1203
02:22:43,573 --> 02:22:45,515
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you so much for the question, Jimmy.

1204
02:22:45,575 --> 02:22:49,579
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for your years of investment in the city.

1205
02:22:49,639 --> 02:22:59,489
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think we're all sad to hear about another story of displacement from our community due to the regional horrible housing cost crisis.

1206
02:23:01,271 --> 02:23:02,973
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll go to my fellow councilors first.

1207
02:23:03,013 --> 02:23:06,617
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll go to Councilor Lemming and then President Behrs for responses.

1208
02:23:09,018 --> 02:23:12,201
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, thank you for the comment.

1209
02:23:12,241 --> 02:23:29,255
[SPEAKER_05]: So part of the very small comment that I made earlier, which I requested the consultants to look into, were different provisions to essentially incentivize or allow different forms of affordable housing in, in,

1210
02:23:32,998 --> 02:23:33,999
[SPEAKER_05]: residential areas.

1211
02:23:34,039 --> 02:23:41,003
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that's what I'm hoping to hear about at the next meeting.

1212
02:23:42,764 --> 02:23:48,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Two points about affordable housing, which is that generally the more housing that they're

1213
02:23:48,807 --> 02:23:54,109
[SPEAKER_05]: that there is in a given area, the more affordable it becomes.

1214
02:23:54,609 --> 02:24:13,414
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, usually when they're making like an apartment building or construction, developers are strongly incentivized to make a certain percentage of the units there be affordable, which normally means that the income can't

1215
02:24:14,214 --> 02:24:20,660
[SPEAKER_05]: go above 80% area and area median income if you're going to live there.

1216
02:24:22,561 --> 02:24:32,250
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't just make it so that you have to have 100% affordable units for developers otherwise nobody would try to develop there and they wouldn't be able to

1217
02:24:33,751 --> 02:24:34,432
[SPEAKER_05]: make a profit.

1218
02:24:34,452 --> 02:24:35,974
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's just that's the reality.

1219
02:24:36,054 --> 02:24:47,128
[SPEAKER_05]: So when mandating affordable housing, there are parts of that under the zoning, which we'll get to later, which do which strongly

1220
02:24:48,202 --> 02:24:49,103
[SPEAKER_05]: incentivize that.

1221
02:24:49,183 --> 02:24:58,510
[SPEAKER_05]: So the TDM program that I've been pushing to for, um, in other communities, those actually do contain strong incentives for affordable units.

1222
02:24:59,731 --> 02:25:03,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I have to look at the details of the green score.

1223
02:25:03,174 --> 02:25:16,345
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure if that's, if that's a part of that, but it, it could be, um, yeah, the just, I'm just kind of thinking, um,

1224
02:25:19,083 --> 02:25:37,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so, oh yeah, and so there are other instances in Medford where we do have 100% affordable units like in Wachling Court, but the thing about that is that it's usually a bunch of layered government grants to actually be able to build that.

1225
02:25:37,577 --> 02:25:41,400
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of something that goes outside of zoning itself.

1226
02:25:41,480 --> 02:25:46,965
[SPEAKER_05]: So the point is when making affordable housing, it's not like something where we can

1227
02:25:47,645 --> 02:26:07,686
[SPEAKER_05]: wave of magic wand to make it happen, but in creating this new zoning, there are very strong incentives that we can do to kind of make it so that when developers are making their spreadsheets, it would be the most profitable option for them to create a percentage of affordable units.

1228
02:26:07,726 --> 02:26:08,667
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, in general,

1229
02:26:09,807 --> 02:26:18,351
[SPEAKER_05]: the more units that you end up creating, the more new building that there is, the more affordable a community becomes in general.

1230
02:26:18,671 --> 02:26:20,232
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you very much.

1231
02:26:20,292 --> 02:26:28,055
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that what you bring up is a wonderful point that is being experienced by many people in our generation.

1232
02:26:30,236 --> 02:26:30,536
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1233
02:26:30,556 --> 02:26:31,696
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll go next to President Beers.

1234
02:26:32,437 --> 02:26:37,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think, try to be as clear as possible.

1235
02:26:39,828 --> 02:26:50,055
[SPEAKER_03]: zoning and the zoning that we're looking at is one prong of different strategies that this council has proposed to address the displacement crisis and the high cost of housing.

1236
02:26:50,075 --> 02:26:54,418
[SPEAKER_03]: The high cost of housing is a regional problem.

1237
02:26:55,959 --> 02:27:00,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Medford, I think, through this zoning and through other things that we are hoping to enact,

1238
02:27:01,772 --> 02:27:14,537
[SPEAKER_03]: be doing more than its part and serving as a model for other communities inside 95 and 495 to step up their act and address the fact that we need tens if not hundreds of thousands of new housing units.

1239
02:27:15,318 --> 02:27:24,301
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the big things that's driving in a there's just demand people want to live here because people want to live in Boston because people like to live here people want to live in Medford because they like Medford.

1240
02:27:25,042 --> 02:27:27,823
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we hear from people who live here it's what we hear from people who

1241
02:27:28,838 --> 02:27:30,761
[SPEAKER_03]: lived here and couldn't afford to live here anymore.

1242
02:27:30,782 --> 02:27:33,346
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's what we hear from people who want to move here who didn't live here.

1243
02:27:35,850 --> 02:27:40,098
[SPEAKER_03]: The way that this zoning helps the affordable housing question is threefold.

1244
02:27:40,939 --> 02:27:41,059
[SPEAKER_03]: One,

1245
02:27:41,737 --> 02:27:47,820
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the big mismatches we have is that our housing stock is not aligned to modern housing household size.

1246
02:27:48,340 --> 02:27:49,861
[SPEAKER_03]: So household size has been declining.

1247
02:27:50,381 --> 02:28:04,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Medford used to have more people than it does now, with actually fewer housing units than it does now, but that's because a lot of people were living in intergenerational households or had parents with lots of kids, so you had four or five people living in a home.

1248
02:28:05,209 --> 02:28:05,629
[SPEAKER_03]: You now have

1249
02:28:06,538 --> 02:28:10,460
[SPEAKER_03]: one, two or three people living in homes that you used to have four or five or six people living in.

1250
02:28:11,220 --> 02:28:19,103
[SPEAKER_03]: So one thing that the zoning is going to try to do is to allow smaller units so that these smaller households can live in them.

1251
02:28:20,563 --> 02:28:34,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Historically converting larger single family homes into as a historical conversion program, we propose to allow two units to try to maintain historical structures to allow people to age in place by putting another unit in their homes.

1252
02:28:35,229 --> 02:28:41,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Another piece that this zoning is going to try to address is what's called the missing middle of housing.

1253
02:28:41,391 --> 02:28:47,753
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a lot of single family and some two family.

1254
02:28:47,913 --> 02:28:53,614
[SPEAKER_03]: And then what we've seen in Medford is a lot of multi, you know, 100, 200, 300, 400 unit apartment buildings.

1255
02:28:54,134 --> 02:28:59,116
[SPEAKER_03]: What we haven't seen a lot of is three, four, five, six, seven, eight unit apartment buildings.

1256
02:29:00,597 --> 02:29:11,647
[SPEAKER_03]: And just by having structures more in that range, you know, they tend to be units are a little bit smaller, it's more economical to have more units on a single parcel of land.

1257
02:29:12,207 --> 02:29:26,180
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of trying to bring back what people call this small a affordable housing which is or naturally affordable housing, which is, you know, housing that is more affordable but it's still quote unquote market rate.

1258
02:29:27,319 --> 02:29:44,621
[SPEAKER_03]: The two pieces of this that personally I think are incredibly important, and also very difficult given the state and federal legal environment are the subsidized affordable units that we get developers to include in projects that's inclusionary zoning generally is what it's called.

1259
02:29:45,222 --> 02:30:04,100
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there is of course social housing public housing subsidized housing which is something that this country in the state has not invested in significantly and is actually most likely the main solution in the long run to having significant mixed income housing and reducing the average price of housing.

1260
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:07,902
[SPEAKER_03]: We treat housing as a commodity we treat housing as an investment.

1261
02:30:08,302 --> 02:30:16,407
[SPEAKER_03]: We're seeing the impacts of that especially in places where supply is limited and demand is very high Medford can only do so much to address that.

1262
02:30:17,526 --> 02:30:20,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Part of what we're going to look at I know Councilman talked about TDM.

1263
02:30:21,870 --> 02:30:35,843
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we also want to look at some of the other affordable housing approaches, and we're hoping to fund what is called a nexus study, which is what is would be required for us to increase our inclusionary zoning.

1264
02:30:36,580 --> 02:30:37,221
[SPEAKER_03]: that would be increasing that.

1265
02:30:37,241 --> 02:30:52,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Requirements which would be increasing that arm of the proposal where we can have, um and require more affordable housing from people who are building market rate housing so that there's a bit more of a mixed income approach there.

1266
02:30:52,353 --> 02:30:58,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Um and something I'm hoping that we'll be able to talk about as we move through this process over the next five months is, uh.

1267
02:31:06,097 --> 02:31:17,366
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm interested to see if we think we need a nexus study to maybe adjust some of the thresholds and the inclusionary that we have now versus going whole hog and like completely redoing it or talking about going up to 20%.

1268
02:31:17,846 --> 02:31:27,994
[SPEAKER_03]: But is there something we could do on the low end around in this mixed in this missing middle area or encouraging some of the structure?

1269
02:31:28,014 --> 02:31:32,978
[SPEAKER_03]: I think one thing we want to avoid in the Cambridge seemed really intentional about trying to avoid is having people build

1270
02:31:33,789 --> 02:31:46,557
[SPEAKER_03]: buildings that are one unit below the minimum requirement for inclusion areas they don't have to do inclusionary and I think that's just something that we want to try to address to so I tried to be simple it's a complicated issue, but really.

1271
02:31:48,453 --> 02:31:54,477
[SPEAKER_03]: by and large, we're trying to figure out how to get more naturally affordable housing within the market rate structures.

1272
02:31:54,737 --> 02:31:59,460
[SPEAKER_03]: We're trying to get more subsidized affordable housing through inclusionary zoning.

1273
02:31:59,480 --> 02:32:13,250
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, we have been able to get a little bit more of the social housing, public housing model through the Medford Housing Authority, their redevelopment, both of the Riverside Avenue building and now Wackling Court.

1274
02:32:14,270 --> 02:32:17,653
[SPEAKER_03]: But for that to really be transformative, we're talking about federal money,

1275
02:32:18,459 --> 02:32:31,674
[SPEAKER_03]: and or a major state program or the state allowing municipalities to use their pride, you know, their beneficial bond rates to, you know, talking about really transformative laws that don't seem to be on the table right now.

1276
02:32:32,395 --> 02:32:36,179
[SPEAKER_03]: And at the state level, they don't seem to be on the table because the

1277
02:32:39,379 --> 02:32:44,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly big housing has a struggle hold over a lot of the policy in the state, and then the federal level.

1278
02:32:45,807 --> 02:32:50,011
[SPEAKER_03]: The Republican Party does not seem particularly interested in using the government to help people.

1279
02:32:50,472 --> 02:32:53,556
[SPEAKER_03]: So, certainly not around housing.

1280
02:32:54,225 --> 02:32:57,286
[SPEAKER_03]: And Democrats have failed there for a very long time.

1281
02:32:57,306 --> 02:33:02,408
[SPEAKER_03]: The past 50 years of federal housing policy is pretty disgraceful from both parties.

1282
02:33:02,688 --> 02:33:11,091
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a long answer, but those are the ways that we're trying to make sure that this zoning policy is focused on affordability.

1283
02:33:14,492 --> 02:33:14,833
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1284
02:33:15,233 --> 02:33:16,373
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Scarpelli, please go ahead.

1285
02:33:17,934 --> 02:33:19,474
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

1286
02:33:20,174 --> 02:33:21,295
[SPEAKER_06]: The simple answer is no.

1287
02:33:22,690 --> 02:33:44,386
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, unfortunately, what we just heard tonight is very simple that when we're looking at single family homes, we're now enticing developers to come in to buy single family homes at a market rate and then come in and put in high priced three family homes that

1288
02:33:45,207 --> 02:33:51,130
[SPEAKER_06]: will have no legal impact to make any of that affordable.

1289
02:33:51,290 --> 02:33:58,094
[SPEAKER_06]: So right now is what we're seeing it in some quarters like Mr Gav will have some leeway.

1290
02:33:58,574 --> 02:34:07,719
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think it's simple answer is this zoning, especially we talked about tonight, will not support affordable housing.

1291
02:34:08,920 --> 02:34:09,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1292
02:34:16,498 --> 02:34:18,419
[SPEAKER_15]: President Behrs, is that a new hand or an old one?

1293
02:34:20,560 --> 02:34:20,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead.

1294
02:34:21,101 --> 02:34:24,763
[SPEAKER_03]: I just can't say how vehemently I disagree with that.

1295
02:34:26,083 --> 02:34:34,828
[SPEAKER_03]: I just answered about 10 ways that we think it does help affordable housing, both small A and big A, and public and social housing.

1296
02:34:36,129 --> 02:34:42,292
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love the federal government to invest $2 trillion in building 4 million social housing units.

1297
02:34:43,967 --> 02:34:47,751
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love the state to allow the city of Menford to take out bonds to build social housing.

1298
02:34:49,433 --> 02:34:59,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Given the laws and the conditions that we have now, that's not going to happen, but these proposals absolutely try to make the housing that we can build here now more affordable.

1299
02:35:01,585 --> 02:35:01,906
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1300
02:35:01,946 --> 02:35:04,048
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll go to Councillor Lemming.

1301
02:35:05,469 --> 02:35:18,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, a lot of the reason we're doing this in the first place is to incentivize affordable housing in the city so to hear my colleagues say that this won't do anything to help affordable housing is wrong.

1302
02:35:19,014 --> 02:35:24,836
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean it's, it's just plain wrong I'm sure he's going to come up with a retort for that but we talked about.

1303
02:35:27,582 --> 02:35:34,248
[SPEAKER_05]: like we're talking about building more, we're talking about mandating a certain percentage of affordable units.

1304
02:35:36,009 --> 02:35:40,012
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all like, that's a lot of what I, that's a lot of what I campaigned on.

1305
02:35:40,032 --> 02:35:51,462
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, my colleague yesterday was basically saying that when residents were coming up to him and asking him about zoning, like he couldn't explain it to them.

1306
02:35:51,502 --> 02:35:53,664
[SPEAKER_05]: And now he's coming here and saying that,

1307
02:35:55,642 --> 02:36:00,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Now he's coming here and saying that he can say definitively that it's not gonna help affordable housing.

1308
02:36:00,424 --> 02:36:05,906
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I mean, it's politically convenient to demonize this whole zoning process.

1309
02:36:06,267 --> 02:36:16,051
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why, but like that is a huge reason behind doing this in the first place is to help out with Medford's affordability problem.

1310
02:36:16,111 --> 02:36:18,912
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's wrong.

1311
02:36:19,512 --> 02:36:21,033
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I'm sorry.

1312
02:36:21,053 --> 02:36:25,295
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why you'd say that.

1313
02:36:29,135 --> 02:36:29,895
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1314
02:36:32,016 --> 02:36:34,457
[SPEAKER_06]: So I could appreciate the on the hand insult.

1315
02:36:34,697 --> 02:36:35,297
[SPEAKER_06]: That's ignorant.

1316
02:36:35,377 --> 02:36:37,318
[SPEAKER_06]: But to move forward very simple.

1317
02:36:37,358 --> 02:36:53,324
[SPEAKER_06]: The question from the gentleman was what we discussed tonight about zoning in our neighborhoods and what we heard with what was taught was spoken tonight and what we're looking at tonight was the quarters of the areas that focused on single

1318
02:36:54,224 --> 02:36:55,485
[SPEAKER_06]: two-family, three-family.

1319
02:36:55,765 --> 02:37:20,918
[SPEAKER_06]: We're talking about conversions of possible areas where the one-families will not be implemented anymore, and that's where we lend to developers to come in to purchase those long-time one-family homes, to develop three-family homes, and not having any right of making any of those affordable.

1320
02:37:21,643 --> 02:37:24,004
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I haven't said anything out of turn.

1321
02:37:24,965 --> 02:37:29,027
[SPEAKER_06]: What I've shared with the council yesterday, Councilor Lemming, was very simple.

1322
02:37:30,667 --> 02:37:36,550
[SPEAKER_06]: Residents don't understand the process because they haven't been informed, hence again this evening.

1323
02:37:37,390 --> 02:37:42,293
[SPEAKER_06]: As we move forward this evening, we were given documents an hour before

1324
02:37:43,442 --> 02:37:45,625
[SPEAKER_06]: And residents didn't know anything about this.

1325
02:37:45,965 --> 02:37:55,958
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm getting text messages now because the area of Tufts University in the train station, no one in that neighborhood has heard of the impact now that that's going to affect their area.

1326
02:37:56,819 --> 02:38:01,124
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can use your underhanded little sly insults as much as you want.

1327
02:38:01,845 --> 02:38:29,482
[SPEAKER_06]: because it hurts because you think you know it all but nothing what you said is true what you all said was very simple you said there are other avenues that we can use for affordable housing i didn't deny that but the question was what we talked about this evening is there anything in there that supports affordable housing and the answer is simple it's no whether i'm a zoning expert or not counselor because seamlessly you think you are

1328
02:38:30,818 --> 02:38:36,746
[SPEAKER_06]: So I appreciate it, Madam Chairperson, but the insults, that's irresponsible.

1329
02:38:46,239 --> 02:38:47,841
[SPEAKER_15]: Question was about housing affordability.

1330
02:38:51,243 --> 02:39:02,213
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it is, I'll just say, I think it is really important that when we're talking about affordability policy that we recognize that that exists in an ecosystem that also includes housing production.

1331
02:39:02,953 --> 02:39:06,977
[SPEAKER_15]: We're talking about housing production, that also that conversation also includes housing policy.

1332
02:39:08,358 --> 02:39:12,781
[SPEAKER_15]: And housing policy has to include what we can do by right at the local level as a community.

1333
02:39:12,821 --> 02:39:27,873
[SPEAKER_15]: And it also has to include things that we're advocating for on the state and federal level, whether that is affordability protections that we are currently not allowed to do by the state and the government that we're advocating for the right to do to better protect people in our community.

1334
02:39:28,793 --> 02:39:38,797
[SPEAKER_15]: or advocating for better funding so that we can make the changes that our residents and our displaced residents would have liked to us to have done years ago that we have no empowerment and no resources to do.

1335
02:39:41,218 --> 02:39:47,961
[SPEAKER_15]: We are years into a regional housing cost crisis that has been pushing people out of Medford for years.

1336
02:39:48,121 --> 02:39:49,601
[SPEAKER_15]: Every time this happens, it's a tragedy.

1337
02:39:52,202 --> 02:40:00,908
[SPEAKER_15]: I do not agree that increasing housing in a reasonable and neighborhood specific way in every single neighborhood is a part of that process.

1338
02:40:01,489 --> 02:40:08,653
[SPEAKER_15]: Is it the same as enacting rent stabilization so that rents cannot go up astronomically and push people out in just a year's time, which is currently legal?

1339
02:40:08,934 --> 02:40:09,874
[SPEAKER_15]: No, it's not the same of that.

1340
02:40:10,475 --> 02:40:13,377
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a more indirect tool, but it is a part of the ecosystem.

1341
02:40:14,677 --> 02:40:41,866
[SPEAKER_15]: And I don't think that we should gloss over the nuances such as the affordable incentives in Greenscore and our building requirements that are baked into the zoning process that allow us to thoughtfully increase affordability, use the levers that we do have in this system so that our zoning, which is the only tools that we have to control what private property owners do on their private property, can also hopefully as often as possible lead to maximum community benefit, which includes more affordable units on the market.

1342
02:40:42,547 --> 02:40:42,967
[SPEAKER_15]: President Behrs.

1343
02:40:44,632 --> 02:40:44,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1344
02:40:44,912 --> 02:40:46,492
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to be equally as clear.

1345
02:40:46,953 --> 02:41:03,636
[SPEAKER_03]: This absolutely does help with affordable housing, increasing missing middle housing helps because we have more units at a more reasonable price point for people to live in increasing inclusionary zoning literally increases the number of affordable units and developments.

1346
02:41:05,097 --> 02:41:05,337
[SPEAKER_03]: And if

1347
02:41:07,340 --> 02:41:36,768
[SPEAKER_03]: we're not making this, you know, if this isn't, if to say no to those facts is not a political approach, I deeply look forward to the support of all of my fellow colleagues on the rental registry, on rent stabilization, on using city resources to help construct affordable housing units, and a number of other policies that have been brought before this council that have been massively politicized for other political gain to support the interests of, quite frankly,

1348
02:41:37,408 --> 02:41:40,491
[SPEAKER_03]: people who own lots of property and rent lots of units in the city.

1349
02:41:40,611 --> 02:41:49,397
[SPEAKER_03]: So if this isn't about politics, I can't wait for the unanimous support of this council for policies that will stop the displacement of residents in the city.

1350
02:41:49,878 --> 02:41:50,718
[SPEAKER_06]: That'll never happen.

1351
02:41:57,664 --> 02:41:58,304
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my point.

1352
02:41:58,384 --> 02:41:58,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1353
02:42:01,066 --> 02:42:02,107
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not hiding from that.

1354
02:42:02,468 --> 02:42:03,388
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not hiding from that.

1355
02:42:03,428 --> 02:42:05,170
[SPEAKER_06]: You're hurting homeowners with those.

1356
02:42:06,261 --> 02:42:07,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Two wrongs don't make a right, Councilor.

1357
02:42:12,185 --> 02:42:17,168
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll go to Councilor Lemming, and then I will make a wrap-up point, and then I will entertain motions to adjourn.

1358
02:42:20,410 --> 02:42:23,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, most of this Council likes to engage in

1359
02:42:24,438 --> 02:42:27,182
[SPEAKER_05]: productive projects and facts, most of us.

1360
02:42:29,285 --> 02:42:34,832
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, these issues do become politicized and that's inevitable.

1361
02:42:35,753 --> 02:42:41,622
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing I would like to point out, because when I answered the question initially, I tried to focus on

1362
02:42:42,863 --> 02:42:44,985
[SPEAKER_05]: what the zoning is doing to help out with this.

1363
02:42:45,045 --> 02:43:00,940
[SPEAKER_05]: But the fact is that for a long period of time, this city council, not this current term, but this body in general didn't really care too much about affordable housing or just never really that high on anybody's to-do list.

1364
02:43:01,760 --> 02:43:07,025
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the projects outside of zoning that we've been engaging in is the

1365
02:43:08,086 --> 02:43:19,450
[SPEAKER_05]: implementing the Affordable Housing Trust, which is basically it's just a pile of money that the city can build up and then put towards affordable housing projects.

1366
02:43:20,511 --> 02:43:30,454
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe it was back in 1989 or so that cities were allowed to make them, and Somerville created their Affordable Housing Trust way back when.

1367
02:43:30,935 --> 02:43:36,837
[SPEAKER_05]: Medford, when it was initiating its linkage fee program, it could have created an Affordable Housing Trust,

1368
02:43:37,537 --> 02:43:38,257
[SPEAKER_05]: but it never did.

1369
02:43:38,317 --> 02:43:42,358
[SPEAKER_05]: It created trusts for water and sewers, parks.

1370
02:43:42,999 --> 02:43:48,320
[SPEAKER_05]: It created trust for the parks, never created an affordable housing trust until 2023.

1371
02:43:49,020 --> 02:44:04,005
[SPEAKER_05]: So in creating a lot of the infrastructure, the instruments of municipal governments that so many other communities took for granted when it comes to supporting affordable housing, Medford

1372
02:44:04,913 --> 02:44:09,034
[SPEAKER_05]: is really behind the curve when it comes out.

1373
02:44:09,054 --> 02:44:10,455
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a lot of catching up to do.

1374
02:44:10,795 --> 02:44:24,979
[SPEAKER_05]: And the city council, part of the reason that we've been so productive in so many different ways is because we have been busy implementing a lot of these things that so many other communities take for granted.

1375
02:44:25,919 --> 02:44:36,345
[SPEAKER_05]: One of those is the affordable housing trust one of those is trying to fund a nexus study to update our affordable housing linkage fees that we could actually put some money towards affordable housing.

1376
02:44:37,026 --> 02:44:44,050
[SPEAKER_05]: And I hope that with all of our efforts, including the zoning including everything else that we're able to put a dent.

1377
02:44:45,098 --> 02:44:45,859
[SPEAKER_05]: in this problem.

1378
02:44:46,519 --> 02:44:53,465
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, my colleague said, there's a lot of other factors that play into this.

1379
02:44:53,565 --> 02:44:56,527
[SPEAKER_05]: This is an issue that goes into the federal government.

1380
02:44:56,587 --> 02:45:00,030
[SPEAKER_05]: This is an issue that you can blame the federal government on, the state government.

1381
02:45:00,330 --> 02:45:03,053
[SPEAKER_05]: And yes, it is an issue that gets politicized.

1382
02:45:03,673 --> 02:45:05,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Zoning is gonna get politicized.

1383
02:45:05,675 --> 02:45:07,336
[SPEAKER_05]: It already has been in these chambers.

1384
02:45:07,936 --> 02:45:10,398
[SPEAKER_05]: But even so, we are going to push forward because

1385
02:45:11,859 --> 02:45:15,882
[SPEAKER_05]: I knocked on about 8,000 doors to get elected.

1386
02:45:16,622 --> 02:45:25,407
[SPEAKER_05]: And the thing that I kept hearing from the most people from the residents of Medford was, why hasn't anything changed significantly in like the last 50 years?

1387
02:45:25,667 --> 02:45:27,348
[SPEAKER_05]: And zoning is a really big part of that.

1388
02:45:28,009 --> 02:45:30,650
[SPEAKER_05]: So, thank you.

1389
02:45:30,830 --> 02:45:35,213
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you all for listening and apologies for making this meeting go on for longer than it needed to.

1390
02:45:39,898 --> 02:45:42,179
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor, I'll go back to you and then I'll wrap up.

1391
02:45:42,239 --> 02:45:43,640
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a point of clarification.

1392
02:45:43,680 --> 02:45:45,962
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate it, Madam Chair.

1393
02:45:46,422 --> 02:45:58,209
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate Councilor Lemming bringing that forward because I was one of the Councilors that supported Councilor Falco's original initial push for the Affordable Trust Act.

1394
02:45:58,229 --> 02:45:59,429
[SPEAKER_06]: So we appreciate that.

1395
02:46:01,390 --> 02:46:09,414
[SPEAKER_06]: And we try to, so we understand sometimes that the people in other offices slow the process down.

1396
02:46:09,954 --> 02:46:11,755
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's one process.

1397
02:46:12,315 --> 02:46:18,958
[SPEAKER_06]: We feel very proud that we can move forward to supporting our efforts in affordable housing.

1398
02:46:19,258 --> 02:46:19,718
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you.

1399
02:46:23,118 --> 02:46:29,403
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli, I think we're all extremely glad and grateful that the Affordable Housing Trust is finally on the books and becoming empowered.

1400
02:46:31,885 --> 02:46:32,525
[SPEAKER_15]: President Behrs?

1401
02:46:37,749 --> 02:46:45,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Just about sure, do you recall the roll call vote count on the home rule petition to update the linkage fee ordinances, or I think it was 6-1?

1402
02:46:47,256 --> 02:46:47,917
[SPEAKER_15]: Sounds like you remember.

1403
02:46:47,937 --> 02:46:48,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1404
02:46:51,079 --> 02:46:52,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Hurting more people, Zach.

1405
02:46:52,906 --> 02:46:54,206
[SPEAKER_06]: more people than you think.

1406
02:47:05,509 --> 02:47:19,091
[SPEAKER_03]: We can build an affordable housing trust all we want, and we can fund it by asking the people who are developing large projects in the city to pay linkage fees, or we could have an affordable housing trust that has no money in it, so no affordable housing gets built.

1407
02:47:19,852 --> 02:47:22,052
[SPEAKER_06]: So keep building zoning to help those developers.

1408
02:47:32,218 --> 02:47:34,741
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a motion to adjourn before I make a final comment.

1409
02:47:36,483 --> 02:47:43,831
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, I hear a motion to adjourn by Councilor Callahan seconded by Councilor Lemming, before we take the roll call vote.

1410
02:47:43,851 --> 02:47:46,334
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to note.

1411
02:47:49,238 --> 02:47:54,102
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it is incumbent upon us who are elected to find solutions to problems and not just to talk about them.

1412
02:47:54,122 --> 02:48:06,033
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it'd be irresponsible for any of us to say that any one strategy is a silver bullet that will solve the rapidly escalating regional housing cost crisis, and that's why nobody says that.

1413
02:48:06,954 --> 02:48:11,798
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it'd be equally irresponsible to say that we should do nothing at all.

1414
02:48:13,200 --> 02:48:14,482
[SPEAKER_15]: Because no solution is perfect.

1415
02:48:15,163 --> 02:48:24,455
[SPEAKER_15]: The reason that we are working on so many that many counselors are working on so many strategies targeted afforded housing affordability is because we know that no one strategy is sufficient.

1416
02:48:25,576 --> 02:48:25,796
[SPEAKER_15]: And I.

1417
02:48:28,620 --> 02:48:51,275
[SPEAKER_15]: look forward to continuing to collaborate with as many counselors as possible on creative solutions that can fit together to create a more affordable environment in Medford between increasing our housing stock, which we know to be necessary, to pursuing greater access to policies that will help renters stay in Medford.

1418
02:48:51,295 --> 02:48:57,059
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, this has gone on too long.

1419
02:49:05,001 --> 02:49:08,842
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion to adjourn by Councilor Callahan, seconded by Councilor Lemming.

1420
02:49:08,862 --> 02:49:11,842
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a roll call vote.

1421
02:49:14,063 --> 02:49:14,643
