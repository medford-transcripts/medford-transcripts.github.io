    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=863.064s">Here's</a>  a co-host.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=865.845s">The</a>  action discussion item for this committee meeting is, as usual, paper <a href="../resolutions/24-033.pdf"><font color="green">24-033</font></a>, zoning ordinance updates with the Innes Associates team. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=877.048s">This</a>  is our third committee meeting on the neighborhood and urban residential <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=882.429s">topic.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=883.41s">We</a>  were introduced to this topic on January 15th. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=886.831s">We</a>  got our first look at kind of a jumping off point proposal, um, around new categories for the residential areas of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=896.675s">We</a>  had some first impressions, questions, suggestions. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=899.456s">Two</a>  weeks ago, we saw an updated draft from our zoning consultant and associates. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=906.94s">Some</a>  of the boundaries had moved around. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=908.48s">We</a>  were able to get a little bit more in depth <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=910.782s">On</a>  the differences between the various sub districts and Councilors also made a number of requests suggestions. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=917.85s">On</a>  places where the boundaries between the various sub districts should move around to better accommodate the topography the geography, the types of residential types that are already existing in the various neighborhoods around Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=929.463s">So</a>  tonight being our third meeting on this topic, we have another amended proposal in front of us that I understand incorporates all of the questions and requests that were made over the past couple meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=940.855s">We're</a>  seeing for the first time kind of more specificity on the urban residential sub-districts under this topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=947.963s">And</a>  just to quickly recap, <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=950.005s">the</a>  neighborhood residential sub districts and the urban residential sub districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=954.827s">These</a>  propose five new ways of categorizing existing residential districts throughout the community, creating a more modernized and more thoughtful gradient from our lowest density areas, residential areas of the city, up to our highest density residential areas of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=973.913s">And</a>  this is informed by, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=976.755s">Topography,</a>  geography, what the land allows, what the streets allow, the types of houses and homes that are already built around the community, and proximity to things that encourage greater density, such as transit, places where there are many jobs concentrated together. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=993.486s">So</a>  I understand that tonight we have a couple, a number of new diagrams to look at and respond to, new proposals for boundaries between the various neighborhood residential sub-districts and urban residential sub-districts, as well as a new map that superimposes the new sub-districts on top of existing residential types in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1012.901s">And</a>  I think this is reflecting some of the requests that councilors made <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1016.123s">two</a>  weeks ago asking for some areas that were, for example, Neighborhood Residential 2 to become Neighborhood Residential 1 again to reflect existing neighborhood character suggestions of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1027.014s">So</a>  unless there are any initial comments from city staff or Councilors, I'll first turn it over to NS Associates for a presentation as usual, and then we can discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1041.751s">All</a>  right, seeing none, I will turn it over to NS Associates whenever you are ready.</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1054.232s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1055.512s">Good</a>  evening everyone Emily and us from NS Associates and I'm here with power almost Martinez. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1061.235s">I'm</a>  actually going to turn it over to power so you can see the work that we've done since the last meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1067.637s">And</a>  then after the presentation or even during if you have specific questions, or we're happy to address any comments or concerns you may have.</p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1079.153s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1081.255s">If</a>  I may, Madam Chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1084.477s">So</a>  in this, today we are going to go also through the process timeline, the plan 2025, the opportunity when those public comments can be done, some introduction analysis, and then the different versions that we have done for this proposal until the last one. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1103.052s">that</a>  we also added this time the urban residential into our proposal and making a bit of more specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1110.314s">What</a>  does that mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1111.154s">I'm</a>  going to go quite fast in the things that we are repeating from the others, but if anyone has any comment or question on that, obviously we are happy to answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1125.818s">So</a>  just for the timeline, today we are in the second part of that neighborhood and urban residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1133.684s">We</a>  are looking today at more that urban part. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1137.588s">So</a>  we are amending that neighborhood residential with the last comments from the planning meeting that we had in January 29th. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1147.978s">And</a>  then we are proposing what type of residential buildings should go into our urban areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1157.94s">Um,</a>  we will also have the CDB. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1160.601s">Um,</a>  so we did last in the 5th of February. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1164.682s">We</a>  did the green score, um, which was referring out back to the City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1170.643s">Um,</a>  we will look into Salem Street again in March the 5th. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1176.765s">And</a>  then we will look into also whenever we pass this, the residential districts and then may the commercial and mixed districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1186.302s">We</a>  also had a public meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1188.963s">We</a>  had one this Monday, February 10th about Salem Street, and we will bring as well some public meetings for the residential, this topic before it goes to CDB in February or March, and then for the squares as well in March, April. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1211.172s">We</a>  will determine better these dates, and we will obviously let you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1217.096s">There</a>  are some video and topics that we will do for the discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1220.038s">We</a>  are working on video one and two about the zoning update, what are we doing, and then more into the Salem Street uses, and then the Salem Street height, Salem Street high bed building massing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1235.67s">Um,</a>  and then the video five about green score. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1238.772s">So</a>  these are we are working on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1240.493s">And</a>  then we will bring as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1242.534s">Some</a>  for the neighborhood districts and uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1245.276s">They</a>  mentioned this commercial notes, commercial districts, um, as well as uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1250.579s">They</a>  mentioned and then transportation demand management parking, which are big topics that we think all of this needs some video so that people can get, um, a more <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1261.565s">the</a>  larger picture of what we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1262.386s">Broad</a>  view or the bigger picture of what we are talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1265.928s">Um</a>  then the plan 2025 just very briefly January. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1272.493s">We're</a>  doing the we didn't neighborhood residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1274.894s">February</a>  is more the urban residential March commercial framework and then the Medford Square, April West Medford and other <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1286.382s">We</a>  had also some citywide topics that we would be discussing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1290.405s">January</a>  was housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1291.426s">In</a>  February, we'll introduce ADU and neighborhood notes. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1295.749s">Then</a>  in March will be community solar and nonconforming use and structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1299.873s">April,</a>  transport demand management and site plan review. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1303.535s">And</a>  then in May, the parking requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1308.018s">So</a>  when are the opportunities for public comments we have what we are doing here today in city council in the planning permitting committee meeting, we present a topic, or we just continue to discuss this topic, then at some point with that topic is ready enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1326.663s">refer</a>  from the City Council towards the CDB then the CDB will listen to the topic and vote as well on that with any recommendations and then it will be referred back to City Council and voted there and then finally being approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1342.407s">So</a>  all these four stages, and that usually we have more in there in the beginning because we come back with a topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1350.794s">Anyone</a>  from the public can introduce can comment on these on any of these issues that they want to, or they are, yeah, they want to refer. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1364.61s">So</a>  we have already done some in the City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1368.793s">We</a>  presented the Salem Street, Mystic Avenue, Green Score, and neighborhood residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1373.476s">Today</a>  we are presenting the most urban residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1377.779s">The</a>  Mystic Avenue was already referred, Salem Street as well, and Green Score. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1383.143s">in</a>  the CDB was presented Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1386.005s">We</a>  have the public meeting and we will have again another presentation of the Salem Street on the 5th of March. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1398.453s">Green</a>  score was already referred as I said and then we will have again these topics being referred again to City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1408.394s">So</a>  any dates that we know and we are, will be updated as well in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1415.127s">So</a>  where do we come from? <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1416.147s">In</a>  January, 2023, Medford published their comprehensive plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1424.149s">And</a>  in there, there are all these topics that were identified through intense public meetings and engagement with the citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1435.291s">This</a>  was citywide. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1436.732s">And</a>  there were some opportunities and topics that were identified. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1443.433s">and</a>  they were done in these strategies of objectives and goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1448.357s">And</a>  so what we are doing here is implementing the part of zoning that refers to the comprehensive plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1455.421s">So</a>  here are some of those that address the issues that we will be talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1464.807s">This</a>  was the plan that was done from the comprehensive that was that comes from the comprehensive plan is the vision, and we will be talking about all these areas of the quarters. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1474.931s">The</a>  residential the squares, some transformational areas, commercial nodes so all of these topics, we will be talking, we already addressed the mystic Avenue quarter, the original quarter. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1488.757s">We</a>  are working on Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1493.058s">And</a>  now at this point, this meeting, we are addressing all the residential neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1500.94s">We</a>  will continue with, as I said, with other regional corridors, with the squares, and other citywide topics. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1510.382s">But</a>  this is the map that we use as the vision. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1514.538s">So</a>  here's your current zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1521.461s">So</a>  what we do now is using all these maps that are analyzed in certain topics. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1528.464s">This,</a>  for example, is about all the transportation modes. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1532.506s">Then</a>  we have the non-exclusively residential neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1537.128s">So</a>  these are more commercial or mixed-use areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1544.773s">we</a>  identify them as the quarters, squares, institutional or certain special districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1551.359s">These</a>  are all the building types for the residential that are in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1559.346s">So</a>  all identified as single family or duplex or three units. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1566.573s">So</a>  we have that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1568.354s">So</a>  all of this and others we consider to build the new residential proposals that we are bringing here today. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1577.501s">So</a>  what factors are we considering is the proximity to high frequent and efficient public transit, proximity to higher job density areas, lot sizes and topography, existing residential types, transition between low and medium density areas, <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1592.513s">So</a>  all of these factors are playing a role in the decisions of where these new residential neighborhoods go. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1602.639s">So</a>  this I'm going to go fast because this was version one. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1605.82s">We</a>  brought this as a version one. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1607.521s">This</a>  got amended to go into a lower density, which we did. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1611.964s">But</a>  when we compare these to the existing types, we're actually down zoning some of the existing areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1620.028s">So</a>  we did another proposal, and that's the version two. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1623.891s">There</a>  were some comments, and that's where we bring the version three. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1629.674s">So</a>  here only with the neighborhood residential one, two, and three. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1634.838s">This</a>  means neighborhood residential one is single unit dwelling plus ADU. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1640.101s">Then</a>  we have historic conversion up to two units. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1643.363s">Red</a>  neighborhood residential to a single dwelling plus at you to unit dwelling and historic conversion to three units and neighborhood residential three single unit dwelling plus at you to three unit dwelling townhouse and historic conversion <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1661.35s">from</a>  2 to 4 units. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1663.431s">Sorry,</a>  this should be from 2 to 4 units. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1667.973s">So</a>  what are the changes that we made to the previous one was in West Medford, we did that transition from 3, 2 to 1. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1676.896s">So</a>  in the northern area, we'll see one neighborhood residential one. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1682.978s">Then</a>  up in Lawrence States on the east area up of Medford Square, it was for neighborhood residential three, and now it's neighborhood residential two, as well as one little square that was also there a bit south. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1702.832s">So</a>  those were changed as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1704.773s">Hillside</a>  on the other side of Boston Avenue, there were some division between neighborhood three and two. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1713.818s">Now</a>  they are both neighborhood residential three because what we saw is that it's very similar in the typologies that are there. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1723.603s">And</a>  I think that is all of the changes that we've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1729.763s">Um,</a>  and we are proposing the different difference between urban residential one and two. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1737.325s">Um,</a>  the urban residential one is to dwelling unit historic conversion 2 to 5. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1744.126s">Townhouse</a>  three unit dwelling and then multiplex, and this is allowing for four up to six units. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1751.888s">Urban</a>  residential two is townhouse three unit dwelling multiplex four to six and then multiple unit dwelling plus six units that is basically only up to three stories high. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1766.824s">That's</a>  the maximum height. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1769.34s">Anything</a>  that goes higher than that, what we recommend is to not have it as an exclusive residential district, but to have a mixed use so that when you have that much higher density of residential, we recommend to also include some commercial, retail, some other uses so that it can provide for that residential density. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1795.988s">And</a>  that's why you will see there a mixed use. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1798.489s">And</a>  in this area, what we have found is that a lot of these more urban areas that have bigger developments, they don't go higher than three stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1810.153s">And</a>  that's why we have all of them in these urban residential too, except for this area of Riverside on the south that they are go higher than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1821.076s">And</a>  that's why we propose that as a mixed use instead of <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1825.117s">another</a>  urban residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1828.999s">And</a>  here we have the same as we did for the others. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1832.14s">We</a>  just, these new districts we put on, we lay over the building types residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1839.222s">So</a>  it's easier to see what is there now and what is coming or what is being sewn up to. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1847.325s">So</a>  if you think this will be a good place to stop and then that we can get some comments from all of you.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1859.811s">great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1860.391s">Thank</a>  you so much for that overview. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1861.752s">Um,</a>  we'll go first to questions and comments from Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1869.678s">I</a>  see Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1871.419s">Go</a>  ahead.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1873.681s">Um,</a>  thank you, Madam Chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1875.442s">I</a>  think <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1876.413s">My</a>  question is just general. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1878.135s">As</a>  we're seeing this, some questions about one, I know that it looks like I think Councilor Leming shared the information to the public on the page so they can share that, because I'm getting texts that people couldn't find this. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1895.749s">And</a>  then the other question I have is, is it possible, Madam Chair, to work with NSF <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1901.373s">With</a>  with the residents trying to understand the process, I know we talked about this yesterday and making things a little bit streamlined. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1909.946s">So</a>  people can understand it better. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1912.029s">I</a>  think 1 of the concerns right now is that the color of the, the, the. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1916.767s">distinctions</a>  between the different urban, uh, residential urban, um, you know, the, to separate them, it's yellow on yellow and orange. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1926.633s">So</a>  is there a way to help that later as we move forward? <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1929.574s">Just</a>  for, just for clarification purpose, so people can understand this a little bit better. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1933.977s">Um,</a>  that's all I have, but thank you.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1937.52s">Great,</a>  thank you so much, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1939.401s">And</a>  yes, I see that Councilor Leming shared meeting files through the City Council's public portal in the chat. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1945.965s">Thank</a>  you for doing that, Councilor Leming.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1948.767s">And-</a>  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1951.089s">Could</a>  we, I just had a resident just text me, Madam Chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1955.812s">I</a>  believe if Councilor Leming can share the ones that were sent today, because I think that, I don't know, I haven't looked at it, but some of the questions that might be, <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1964.617s">The</a>  ones shared from an older slides. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1968.439s">So,</a>  if we can just look at that, that'd be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1971.181s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1972.601s">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1973.062s">We</a>  will double check. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1978.277s">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1978.778s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1979.158s">We</a>  will double check that it's possible that the wrong files were updated to the public portal for today. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1983.743s">My</a>  apologies. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1984.363s">We'll</a>  make sure that they are updated ASAP after the meeting and they will match what's on the screen so that folks can, you know, zoom in. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1991.49s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1993.252s">Investigate</a>  them on their own time. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1994.693s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1995.835s">And</a>  I'll go to NS Associates for a direct response related to the colors on the maps.</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2004.032s">Yes,</a>  thank you very much Madam Chair we are we are sympathetic to the color differences we're happy to look at how we can further differentiate them I will just note that we're using the standard kind of planning land use colors of yellow for residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2019.163s">There</a>  are only so many gradations of yellow that don't start to blur into each other so we certainly appreciate the Councilors comment comments on this and we'll see what we can do to better differentiate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2029.789s">It</a>  may be for the purposes of our discussion here we can we can vary from the plant the standard planning colors for land use and get a bit better better variation, so thank you for the comment.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2041.595s">Just</a>  wanted to share what we're hearing so I appreciate you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2044.037s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2045.855s">great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2046.175s">Thank</a>  you, Scarpellian. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2046.936s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2047.456s">We</a>  want to make sure that the maps are easy to read, so we'll work together to find a solution on that so that the colors are easily differentiatable. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2057.622s">And</a>  on the other note about wanting these proposals to be easily legible for residents, whether they're tuning into these meetings or catching up after the fact, we had a great discussion about this last night. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2070.57s">We</a>  are <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2071.571s">working</a>  really hard to overhaul, you know, or to onboard a couple new tools, including a pretty major overhaul to the city's zoning website, which will have kind of the very, very short elevator pitch version of all of these proposals, so that folks can get oriented to what we're talking about ahead of these meetings and just have an easier on ramp to discussing this work in progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2094.304s">Go</a>  next to President Bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2098.457s">Thank</a>  you, Madam Chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2100.058s">Just</a>  wanted to thank you guys for continuing to update these early maps based on the conversations that we've been having. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2112.968s">I</a>  know a next step is going to be looking at the dimensional requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2122.036s">But</a>  I just wanted to be clear here, all of the residential districts, we're talking about a three-story maximum height. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2128.058s">Okay,</a>  so we're not going over three stories anywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2132.902s">Have</a>  you had any initial thoughts into the dimensional requirements? <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2140.287s">Is</a>  that something we're probably going to see at the next meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2142.269s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2145.211s">And</a>  I think in general, I appreciate the changes that have been made. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2150.055s">I</a>  think, you know, this NR2 district north of the square <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2155.385s">was</a>  something we talked about, and I think it just better, it's more cohesive and kind of better describes the topography of the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2165.192s">Other</a>  than that, my only question was about this mixed-use two district, or potential mixed-use district, and that looks like it's at the Mystic Place Towers, essentially, and it's the idea there just that <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2182.218s">I'm</a>  guessing we're not going to see a significant redevelopment of that in any reasonable period of time, but is the idea just that we don't want to put that in an urban residential too because it would be non-conforming because the structures are so tall? <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2197.803s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2201.124s">And</a>  then just basically everything else that's <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2204.383s">of</a>  that kind of height and scope fall into the mixed-use corridors and square districts? <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2210.189s">Okay,</a>  that's a yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2211.27s">I'm</a>  just... Got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2217.016s">Kit,</a>  if you could... Sorry.</p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2222.105s">to</a>  clarify for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2223.906s">Yes,</a>  everything that you said is is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2226.367s">A</a>  lot of this higher are going to be in the corridors or in the squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2230.97s">And</a>  so we will examine those will which which we think yes, it will go into mix in some kind of mixed use. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2238.674s">For</a>  the riverside. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2239.654s">We</a>  we are aware that right now there is already a development. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2243.957s">Um</a>  and it's more for the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2246.178s">Um,</a>  what that could be. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2249.219s">And</a>  if we do it as an urban residential too, as you said, we'll be non-conforming.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2254.26s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2255.561s">And</a>  then my only other kind of very minor question is around on South Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2267.764s">There's</a>  a number of parcels. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2271.424s">You</a>  see kind of this urban residential <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2274.962s">four</a>  corners right southwest of Medford Square, the orange right under the words Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2286.926s">I'm</a>  pretty sure the buildings on the northwest, northeast, and southeast corners of that intersection are apartments or condos. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2297.257s">Could</a>  you go into it all the condition of the buildings, south of South Street and west of what I think is Thomas Street of my mind is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2307.98s">Basically,</a>  This title piece right here in this you are to district.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2338.055s">care</a>  if you could.</p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2341.599s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2343.22s">If</a>  I remember correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2344.822s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2345.102s">There</a>  are a lot of buildings that I looked in to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2350.388s">Um,</a>  there were I think there was. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2354.232s">These</a>  were multifamily <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2357.054s">above</a>  the six units, if I'm not mistaken, and these were up to three stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2365.079s">So</a>  that's why the category would go into the urban too, only because it's multifamily, more than six. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2375.245s">I</a>  can look at that and check if that is as I remember.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2381.269s">Great,</a>  yeah, if you could, just that's the only thing I looked at that I saw that I thought might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2388.907s">It's</a>  just that south, you know, if we take the four corners of that intersection, that southwest piece, I might be remembering the built condition differently than it actually exists. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2401.056s">But</a>  thank you, and I really appreciate this updated proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2404.499s">I</a>  think just making clear to everyone that we're talking about three-story structures in these neighborhoods is just really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2414.648s">and</a>  that, you know, dimensional requirements and those other things are going to really come into play. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2418.829s">But,</a>  oh, the only other thing we talked a little bit about, kind of a design guideline or, I don't know, advice, something like that around slopes of roof lines and enabling that third story to be mostly utilized, but also try to keep with some of the <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2444.524s">to</a>  avoid the flat roof kind of effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2448.146s">Is</a>  that something we might be talking about for when we talk about dimensional as well?</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2457.833s">Yes,</a>  so that is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2460.414s">As</a>  we look at the dimensional standards, we wanted to get the geography set because we'll go back to our mapping of existing nonconformities and see what we need to do in each area. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2473.022s">you</a>  know, how close can we get to the ideal for each of these zone types? <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2478.527s">Do</a>  we need modifications for a specific area? <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2481.37s">And</a>  then yes, that idea of we'd like the residential buildings to be consistent with what's in Medford, but also consistent with good design going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2493.842s">So</a>  we can look at the slope of roofs, we can look at <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2497.685s">as</a>  we've done in other communities, we can look at things like how are dormers attached and are there proportional requirements for additions and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2506.729s">So</a>  we can think that through and is that better expressed in the zoning or is it better expressed in an advisory design guidelines component, which is outside zoning, but used in certain processes. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2521.596s">So</a>  we're keeping that in mind.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2523.377s">Great,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2528.409s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2529.03s">We'll</a>  go next to Councilor Leung.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2537.035s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2537.335s">So</a>  just some general requests for the consultants and city staff either to clarify what's currently <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2547.334s">in</a>  the zoning or what some of the options could be moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2551.278s">So</a>  I'm currently working in a city group that is investigating the possibility of starting up a community land trust and we were looking at a couple of different potential city-owned parcels around the city and some of them were <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2571.844s">some</a>  of them were constrained by current zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2575.888s">So</a>  even if we were to decide to put a community land trust in some of these areas, it would be very little community owned affordable housing that could actually be built. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2587.24s">So</a>  I would like to know just for a future meeting or <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2592.865s">what</a>  are the options for even an email? <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2594.046s">What</a>  some options for something like that would be like, um, what are the cities? <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2601.273s">Uh,</a>  there's a city. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2602.794s">What</a>  are the cities are currently currently offer in terms of an inclusionary overlay? <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2609.019s">Um</a>  and is there a possibility of putting <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2616.085s">is</a>  infill zoning going to be a part of this? <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2620.027s">That's</a>  another thing that I would like to see just kind of mentioned or explored. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2630.19s">I've</a>  also been pushing a lot for a transportation demand management program because, which I understand we're going to discuss in April, but Everett has implemented that very successfully, and I would <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2645.075s">like</a>  to see if some of the consultants would be able to reach out to some of the planners within Everett to understand some of the details of how they've implemented that and whether it's only applied to urban areas or whether something like that usually goes into residential areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2662.583s">Essentially</a>  just a little bit more information on some of these <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2667.066s">not</a>  specifically the zoning maps, but some of the rules that could apply to residential areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2675.831s">So,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2682.855s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor, we're happy to look into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2686.736s">Delighted</a>  to talk to Everett about their experience and how well that's worked and the extent of where their transportation demand management program is applied. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2695.76s">I</a>  think that in thinking about how to allow for some of the possibilities of infill development, some of that will come with the dimensional standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2706.884s">We</a>  know already that there's some issues about existing lot sizes. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2711.185s">where</a>  the actual lot sizes are non-conforming with the zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2714.826s">So</a>  in right-sizing that, that should open up some opportunities for infill. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2719.408s">We</a>  can see what that might mean. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2720.769s">Do</a>  we need to add others? <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2722.689s">Certainly</a>  also, I think bringing in, as you know, we have Jonathan Silverstein as the legal consultant on this, and he may also have some ideas <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2734.494s">about</a>  other strategies that communities have used to add affordable housing in different ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2739.678s">So</a>  in addition to the work that we've done, we will also consult with him on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2743.601s">But</a>  I think we can find some options for the city councilors to discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2748.004s">Happy</a>  to look into that.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2751.307s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2751.607s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2754.449s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Leming for those suggestions and President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2761.898s">Thank</a>  you again for updating this proposal with a lot of our questions and suggestions. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2767.662s">From</a>  the past couple meetings really glad to see that a couple of the couple of the areas that really jumped out at a lot of Councilors like in West Medford has been, I think, I think we came to consensus so that'd be more appropriate at our lowest level of density great to see that reassigned and we had a <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2784.893s">very</a>  robust discussion around Lawrence Estates and the border of Forest Avenue last time, so thank you for making those adjustments as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2794.237s">Now</a>  that the urban residential subdistricts have entered the frame, I had just another kind of one more <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2804.027s">relatively</a>  minor in the grand scheme of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2806.288s">As</a>  far as the map goes, question that I was hoping to get your assessment on either now or something to peruse before our next meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2813.851s">Looking</a>  at the transit proximate zone around Magoon Square in South Medford, there's an urban residential one subdistrict right around the T stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2826.076s">It's</a>  abutted by neighborhood residential three on a lot of sides, actually on all sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2830.217s">It's</a>  abutted by neighborhood residential three. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2833.718s">And</a>  I think the urban residential one sub district is appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2837.519s">That's</a>  reflective of, you know, obviously, as is the case with the rest of the map, that's reflective of the type of housing that's already there. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2844.061s">My</a>  question is for the kind of corridor of neighborhood residential three that travels down Main Street to where it intersects with Broadway. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2854.45s">I</a>  would be curious for your assessment on recategorizing that as urban residential one. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2858.991s">In</a>  my assessment, that is pretty similar to a lot of the existing residential types and topography that we see in the sub-district that is labeled residential, urban residential one. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2870.934s">And</a>  I think equally as importantly, it's one of the areas in the city that is actually really well served by bus lines, a couple of bus lines that go straight down to Sullivan. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2879.355s">I</a>  think there's a lot of transit users that live right around there. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2882.836s">And</a>  I wonder if that could be upgraded to urban residential one to reflect that and then have it grade down into neighborhood residential three in keeping with the current proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2901.677s">I'm</a>  hard to hear over the fan. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2902.878s">Oh,</a>  weird. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2910.33s">Can</a>  you hear me better now? <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2911.092s">I</a>  can repeat myself.</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2915.352s">Yes,</a>  because the air turned on we're not quite sure which just do I think we didn't all didn't quite catch which district that you meant. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2922.757s">So,</a>  the short answer is we're happy to relook and see the type of, you know, the building types that are in the area, and understand whether or not it should be reclassified so yes to that always happy to look at that but we just want to confirm the area.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2939.39s">Absolutely,</a>  yes, sorry about that the air conditioning in this room is. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2944.365s">Um,</a>  famously louder than I am. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2947.567s">Um,</a>  the area that I'm talking about is the, uh, in South Medford, along the Main Street corridor. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2954.932s">Um,</a>  you have the Urban Residential 1 subdistrict that's in the Magoon Square T-stop radius, and then southeast of that, on either side of Main Street, we have Neighborhood Residential 3. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2968.04s">My</a>  observation is that I think an existing residential type that's really similar to what we see in Urban Residential 1 <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2974.384s">and</a>  it's very well served by a couple of bus lines that go straight down Broadway to Somerville, sorry, Sullivan Station. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2981.228s">So</a>  I'd like to see that assessed for if it would make sense to upgrade it to UR1.</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2993.656s">We've</a>  confirmed that area.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2994.837s">We're</a>  happy to reassess that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2996.078s">Thank</a>  you so much for clarifying. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2997.779s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2998.219s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2998.599s">Also</a>  just repeating myself for the benefit of those on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3001.181s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3004.898s">Going</a>  next to President Bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3010.883s">Thank</a>  you, Chair Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3014.306s">Similarly,</a>  yeah, I definitely agree that that area between Main Street and Medford Street that contains Bow Street and Dexter Street and some of those others is something to be considered. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3027.857s">I'm</a>  also looking at the <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3035.977s">area</a>  between Boston Ave and the Somerville border. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3041.82s">It's</a>  just those three, three kind of parcels on, or sections of parcels on like Bristol. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3051.045s">And</a>  those might, I think you might wanna, those could be, I think, considered as well, just because they're so proximate to Ball Square and so proximate to, <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3063.368s">Somerville</a>  zoning, including in some cases, like on the other side of the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3068.771s">And</a>  I know that they're zoned up to three. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3071.813s">So</a>  that might just be another place to think about just with the transit access on, I can't think of the other names of those roads, but those three right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3081.679s">And</a>  something I think I've had, just looking at this area, some questions about <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3092.472s">is</a>  Harvard Street in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3100.597s">I'm</a>  just wondering if... I mean, I think it'll be relatively easy when we talk about the corridors to decide more specifically what the corridor parcels are. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3116.105s">And</a>  it looks like from your nodding heads, that's kind of the thought that you guys are having as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3120.456s">And</a>  I see that on Main Street and Medford Street, but I have just a general qualm about Harvard Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3128.924s">It's</a>  certainly a corridor from the perspective of vehicular bike walking traffic, like it's a connecting street, but the built condition really is, I think, pretty much continuous with the neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3149.253s">So</a>  just looking at that, I can see coming back to it after we do the corridors, but I think there's just as strong an argument to be made that maybe we should just connect the districts that are currently separated out to the east and the west of Main Street as we are right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3169.947s">But</a>  I'm interested to hear more what you guys were thinking there.</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3175.444s">I'll</a>  let Paula answer to the what we were thinking the specific place but I do want to touch on that larger issue that you know we're taking the city pieces at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3184.908s">And</a>  I think for almost everything maybe with the exception of Mystic Avenue which was fairly self contained I think when we looked at in many ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3193.692s">But</a>  I think as we fill in the other quarters, the squares, we're likely going to see some areas where we want to make some final boundary changes, I think as we get more information as not just the input from yourselves but from members of the public that we've heard from during this process that there's probably going to be sort of a <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3213.632s">Oh,</a>  let's look at that parcel a little bit harder. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3215.313s">It</a>  needs to go one way versus the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3217.394s">So</a>  we think it's really important, as we're doing now to get the neighborhoods as right as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3224.316s">But</a>  I think we should all be aware that we may have to come back and just make some changes to those boundaries sometimes boundaries a little fuzzy. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3231.879s">So</a>  what looks right, either when you're on the ground or what looks like when you're on the looking down on the map don't always agree and so which is of course one of the reasons we're having these conversations but <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3242.903s">just</a>  to be aware that there'll be some fine tuning towards the end.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3246.566s">Just</a>  before, just directionally, we're probably talking about the neighborhood zones moving in towards the corridors, not the other way around. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3256.554s">So</a>  people probably parcels that might not be in the neighborhood boundary right now, probably ending up in them versus the other way around.</p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3265.36s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3269.383s">Yeah,</a>  I agree with you that that was a very like, <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3273.496s">If</a>  we have Mystic that is regional, then we have others that are more like neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3278.741s">This</a>  was even a lower scale of those. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3281.504s">And</a>  I think that maybe at the end, we'll end up with just the crossing with the other to be just that corner of mixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3290.834s">And</a>  then the rest would be the residential matching with the neighborhood and what is already there. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3296.919s">So</a>  it doesn't mean that because we say a corridor is going to be all mixed use, there will be like we have in Salem blocks, entire blocks that are residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3306.002s">So</a>  once we look at that street, we will see maybe it's only when it touches Main Street that then is that corner of mixed, but then the rest is just residential.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3318.586s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3319.166s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3319.386s">And</a>  that makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3320.267s">And</a>  I think, you know, some element of the <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3325.68s">The</a>  more I looked at it, the more I was like this feels more like kind of that dashed corridor along high street that we have and I think there's probably Some of Boston have a budding parcels to and I see them, you know, you have the Boston have parcels on the southwest side of Boston have that are in the neighborhood zone and <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3345.586s">up</a>  to a certain point and then you have the mixed uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3348.007s">And</a>  so I see where you're going for there, but I think it's just important to note for folks that like, just because something is still in that kind of mixed use square and quarter boundary right now, there's a likelihood, especially if it seems like a lot of the existing structures are purely residential, that those are gonna end up being <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3371.132s">part</a>  of the residential districts or something rather than part of the mixed use or square corridor type districts.</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3377.894s">Yes,</a>  and I want to echo what Paula said you know as we're learning from looking at Salem Street which is defined as a quarter we're hearing, you know, as we boots on the ground again right is that idea of what's a quarter versus what's a neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3394.163s">We've</a>  also talked about these areas of neighborhood hubs where there's already existing commercial that serving neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3402.347s">How</a>  do we make those conforming how do we allow for those without disrupting neighborhoods so I think we're learning some, some lessons from for talking with Salem looking at Salem delving into that, that will then apply of that push pull of where neighborhood is versus where the mixed uses is and then what are mixed uses are sorry my English is going on a Wednesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3427.958s">And</a>  then also, you know, where do we have these hubs of activity at what scale versus where do we go back into the neighborhood? <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3436.504s">So</a>  I think that will be a continuing conversation as we move through this. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3441.929s">And,</a>  you know, it's a good, this back and forth, this iterative back and forth I really think lends itself to that process of evaluation.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3450.535s">Great,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3455.747s">Great,</a>  thank you, President Bears, I appreciate that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3460.81s">Do</a>  I see any additional comments or questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3465.852s">President</a>  Bears, go ahead.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3468.674s">Sorry,</a>  just, I know there was also the commercial nodes, so maybe we wanna talk about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3480.32s">Huh?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3481.62s">Yeah,</a>  the little, yeah, there was that map where there was just like the tiny, <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3485.656s">Within</a>  these districts, there are a few places that have commercial on them.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3500.227s">One</a>  second while we find the right file.</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3501.908s">Oh,</a>  just- Do you want to move to the neighborhood hubs?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3506.792s">Just,</a>  yeah, talked about those, the commercial nodes and the residential districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3509.914s">Were</a>  we going to talk about that?</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3520.112s">Yeah,</a>  if you want to go to that, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3522.034s">Go</a>  for it.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3525.837s">No,</a>  it's fine.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3527.238s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3527.819s">We</a>  were sideboring a little bit because there's another area that now that I'm looking at it again, I'm realizing maybe we should consider it being different than the way it's presented on the map. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3539.649s">And</a>  so I just wanted to raise that to you all tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3543.912s">rather</a>  than have it just show up different because I said so off line. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3547.776s">Um,</a>  so there's an area that's urban, so I just wanted to make sure like sort of flag in this proposal urban residential one and two doesn't actually allow single dwelling units by right so single family homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3562.548s">in</a>  those neighborhoods would become non-conforming. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3565.531s">And</a>  we're generally trying not to make things non-conforming. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3569.015s">So</a>  if you look at the area that I think if I describe as the top T stop, there's an UR1 and urban residential one right above it that is actually very heavy single family homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3584.049s">And</a>  I'm proposing whether that would actually be more appropriately NR3, because the request for density is because those homes have the best proximity to a T-stop anywhere in Medford that is really walkable. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3598.972s">So</a>  you should be allowing more density. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3601.813s">But</a>  I'm mildly concerned about making that entire area nonconforming and how that would play out. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3609.167s">in</a>  the long run for various things. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3611.708s">Maybe</a>  leaving the area that's already very heavy to family as urban residential one, because two unit dwellings are by right in urban residential ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3626.254s">So</a>  I just, I kind of wanted to flag that as something we should look at again. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3632.196s">And</a>  I think Emily wants to follow up on that.</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3642.535s">Yes,</a>  with your permission Madam Chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3644.616s">Thank</a>  you for bringing that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3646.316s">We</a>  had been talking about that in house as you would imagine, and so we were balancing that idea of making the single family not as a right but putting in protection so that non conforming single family <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3662.942s">would</a>  be exempt from certain waivers. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3665.123s">We've</a>  used that tax in other places before. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3667.944s">So</a>  for example, if you're a non-conforming, you wanted to put a porch on, you weren't having to go to the ZBA to do that or whatever you might otherwise have to get a waiver for, you were able to do it as of right. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3683.37s">So</a>  whether it's a change in the district, which of course, obviously we continue to be open to in this iterative process, <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3691.694s">or</a>  whether it's putting in that non-conforming exemptions for the single families in those neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3699.84s">I</a>  think we're open to figuring out with you the solution that makes the most sense for these districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3708.147s">And</a>  that may be something that we continue to leave open for a little bit until maybe after you've seen what that language would look like, or it's something that we address now, whichever makes sense at this point.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3719.648s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3720.248s">I'll</a>  go to President Bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3721.789s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3722.77s">And</a>  I think just one thing on that topic that I think the most important thing that I think we were reminding a lot of folks on this on Monday night, right. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3734.096s">The</a>  goal generally is that and obviously like to change the zoning does not mean that someone has to change anything about their property. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3741.92s">So</a>  if you're a single family home, and you don't want to change anything about it, <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3746.527s">just</a>  because the zoning district changes doesn't mean you have to change anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3751.729s">Something</a>  we're also trying to control for here, and it's tough, right, is, and because state law has special exemptions for single-family zoning, it makes it even harder for single-family structures, the proximity <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3772.516s">of</a>  that of those parcels to the transit access, even before the Green Line extension we've been seeing a lot of a lot of neighborhoods, very very large single family new or significantly renovated single family structures being built, and I think we don't <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3790.712s">want</a>  to see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3792.413s">It's</a>  just not what we want to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3794.014s">I</a>  think most people generally who live here now are not happy to see what was a relatively standard-sized single-family unit turn into a mini-mansion that's maxing out lot size and dimensionals. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3807.684s">And</a>  I think the closer you are to a T-station, the more that the financials are probably going to break down for a property owner or developer to say, <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3815.771s">Oh,</a>  I could build a single family here. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3817.692s">I</a>  could take this relatively normal sized single family, turn it into this giant 3,800, 4,000 square foot single family. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3823.094s">It's</a>  500 feet from the T and sell it for $2.2 million, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3832.555s">when</a>  you could have, if you don't allow the by right new construction or significant renovation, at least they'd have to do two units. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3840.182s">And</a>  the goal would be to incentivize them to do three or four because for 1000 square foot units is gonna be much better close to something like that in a walkable neighborhood than a giant mansion. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3851.513s">So</a>  I kind of like more interested or amenable to the idea of saying, <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3858.313s">how</a>  can we make sure that people who are in existing single families now don't get that, by not allowing single family buy right, we can avoid all the impacts of them becoming nonconforming versus saying, we're gonna allow the single family so close to the transit where the land value is so high and then maybe get these weird externalities of big new single family housing exactly where we don't want it to be.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3893.87s">PB,</a>  Lisa Smith-Miyazaki, she-her, hers. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3907.12s">before,</a>  now you need to go to the variance. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3909.261s">And</a>  we do not wanna be sending a lot of single family homes to the ZBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3913.402s">So</a>  like some of the things that I signed off on building permits today were, you know, they wanted to expand the kitchen. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3919.884s">So</a>  they took the porch and they turned it into a kitchen, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3922.905s">Like</a>  they turned it into a room and people who wanted to add dormers on because, or a second floor onto a one and a half story house. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3930.428s">Like</a>  those are things that people should be able to continue to do without having to go to the ZBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3936.37s">And</a>  that's the kind of thing that we want to hit that balance. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3939.271s">So</a>  if there's a way to put that in so that those existing single families don't suddenly become like unable to do any nice improvements to their house. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3950.373s">And</a>  I'm not sure, like I don't actually know how far, like I was signing off on kitchen remodels and new bathrooms today. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3956.554s">Like,</a>  I don't think that would actually fall under here, but I honestly don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3961.915s">So.</a> </p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3965.492s">And</a>  if I may add something to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3968.394s">So</a>  now that the protected use ADUs are our law and we're trying to update our process. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3978.16s">So</a>  our zoning isn't updated, but we have to allow these. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3980.702s">So</a>  the building commissioner and I today were <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3983.341s">you</a>  know, going back and forth of trying to adapt our accessory structure ordinance to the new regulations that were recently promulgated and <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3999.333s">One</a>  thing that I'm concerned about is, so they're only allowed, but we could have more permissive requirements or allowances for ADUs, but right now the protected use ADU is only required to be allowed in single family zoning districts, which they defined as any zoning district where single families are allowed, either by right or by special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4022.966s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4025.328s">if</a>  you have a single family in the UR1, would they be able to add an A to you or would that just be something that we would have to amend our zoning? <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4033.664s">So</a>  it wouldn't, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4041.362s">So</a>  that is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4043.283s">It's</a>  any district in which single families are allowed as of right or best special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4047.405s">So</a>  if for the urban one or the urban two, which don't allow single family as of right, then ADUs would not be allowed because they're not allowed as of right and single families not allowed as of right in that district. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4061.551s">We</a>  did discuss that at one point as well to try and think of what the implications were. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4066.813s">That</a>  doesn't mean that you couldn't allow a to use in those districts but they wouldn't follow our, our understanding is they wouldn't fall under that law. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4076.619s">That</a>  helps.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4077.059s">Great,</a>  thank you for the discussion on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4086.145s">Oh,</a>  hang on one second Councilor Kelly.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4091.055s">I</a>  just wanted a super quick clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4092.797s">It</a>  sounds like you're saying that if we don't do anything differently, and this is a UR1, but there's a lot of single family homes, they will not be able to build an ADU. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4105.208s">And</a>  I just want to have a little check in, maybe I missed it, but that we can, in fact, write something into the zoning to ensure that they will be able to do an ADU by right?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4124.348s">So,</a>  Madam Chair, we could we could say that are that at us are allowed on single family homes in this district or single or two family, whatever it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4133.618s">I</a>  think that the state sort of sets a floor for what we're allowed to do but if we want to allow more than that.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4143.423s">I</a>  just want to make sure that we're not like allowing ADUs in all the single family places. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4147.264s">But</a>  if there happens to be a single family home in a, you know, zoned something that's not single family, that they're not then not allowed to do the same thing all the other single families are. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4155.246s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4157.326s">I</a>  think the question just to paraphrase is, we want to make sure that a non conforming single family home could still build an ADU. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4166.815s">Or</a>  I'm paraphrasing your question.</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4169.316s">Yes,</a>  it is our understanding that you can always be more permissive, but you can't be less permissive. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4175.478s">You</a>  can't be more restrictive. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4177.519s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4178.079s">President</a>  Bears?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4178.819s">Just</a>  to draw this down to maybe an unnecessary rabbit hole of use case, but this is probably only going to apply if they want the accessory unit and accessory structure right. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4191.003s">Because</a>  otherwise, if it's in the principal structure, they just call it a two unit, and that's allowed by right.</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4199.402s">Yes</a>  and no. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4200.844s">So</a>  ADU, the difference between a two unit structure and a single unit with an ADU is that ADUs usually have size restrictions, whereas a two, so you could have, I think the state is 900 right now, 900 or 50%. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4214.817s">So</a>  thank you, Paula. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4221.844s">for</a>  bringing up the right amount, I should have just looked over at your screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4225.706s">So</a>  that is the difference is the size restriction for the ADU. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4230.369s">So,</a>  and the parking as the other piece is that the state has requirements on the parking for those districts where the state law applies, they have requirements in the parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4242.335s">So</a>  there's a choice there. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4243.416s">There</a>  is also the practical matter of can a single unit, single family, <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4251.02s">be</a>  retrofitted to be either a two unit, or a single with an ADU, or then do you need that detached ADU? <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4259.146s">So</a>  there's, there's a thing where zoning says one thing, but the practicalities of market and construction and building code and all of that say something else.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4269.833s">So</a>  it's, it's, it's certainly case specific, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4274.537s">Where</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4276.192s">the</a>  two unit, you would have more freedom as to the square footage, but maybe a higher parking requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4281.636s">So</a>  you might choose to do the ADU because the parking requirements 0.5 less. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4286.78s">And</a>  so you can fit that on a lot based on the dimensionals. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4290.402s">But</a>  certainly, I guess my main question is, you'd have to do that if they wanted to do it in a non-principle structure, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4299.689s">But</a>  you couldn't have, because we're not allowing two <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4303.208s">I'm</a>  assuming we're not allowing two principal structures on the same lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4305.77s">Like</a>  they couldn't say it's a two unit, but one unit's in a detached garage and one unit's in the principal structure.</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4311.795s">Yes,</a>  yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4312.855s">Yeah,</a>  but it would be a detached ADU at that point rather than a duplex is attached. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4319.02s">Some</a>  form of it is attached to each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4321.542s">So</a>  you wouldn't have principal house A and principal house B and call it a two unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4326.946s">Yes,</a>  agreed.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4327.626s">So</a>  that's a case where not allowing the ADU <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4331.81s">For</a>  the non conforming single family would eliminate the ability to add a second unit either way, because, yeah, so I think that's where I'm just trying to take it down that yeah down that rabbit hole where like oh well. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4344.827s">But</a>  they could have two units anyway so do they need it but not if they wanted to detach structure if they want to preserve a carriage house or something.</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4350.574s">And,</a>  and they may with respect they may want an ad you for other reasons right you know as opposed to a second entire unit there's a whole host of other reasons why that might be the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4362.007s">So</a>  I think then what that becomes is as we're looking at our non conforming language to address a single family house that is in a now in a district that doesn't allow single family, which is, I am certain although I haven't looked at, but in I have seen in other communities where you have a single family and a commercial district. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4382.657s">It's</a>  non-conforming, has to go through variances, so it's not an unusual case, but we want to add language that allows it to have waivers from those variances. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4393.388s">We</a>  also would want to add language that allows it to be able to put the ADU in there consistent with other single family, and we can do that.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4401.455s">Yeah,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4402.977s">And</a>  I think, you know, I mean, I'm sure you'll do it, but... <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4405.982s">We</a>  had some of these conversations when we were doing the new nonconforming sections of the recodification a couple of years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4412.629s">So</a>  there may be some language that's already applying citywide that might help here.</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4417.233s">We'll</a>  just need to evaluate that.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4418.915s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4426.643s">Great,</a>  thank you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4429.516s">I</a>  think this is a useful rabbit hole to be going on now as we're talking about, you know, other areas on the residential map, where we want to at least be looking at options for language for non conforming. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4442.86s">striking</a>  that right balance in between zoning these districts, such as that we are not including any things that are greater gifts to developers than they are to the community and residents, especially close to transit, but are also not creating unnecessary hurdles for folks who are living in what may become non-conforming structures in some of these recategorized residential sub-districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4468.939s">Go</a>  to Councilor Leming.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4471.858s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4472.498s">So</a>  not to go down, not to explore various steps of the rabbit hole too much, but just to remind the planners and consultants, some of the folks at Housing Medford and I did work on a draft of an ADU ordinance a couple of months ago, which we <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4495.123s">discussed</a>  pretty extensively. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4497.888s">So</a>  I just want to make sure that that draft is on your radar. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4504.198s">And</a>  if it's sort of buried in layers of emails, then I can resend that to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4509.683s">Um,</a>  as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4511.664s">Um,</a>  I understand that some parts of it might have changed because the some of the recent like state laws been updated since then. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4520.066s">So</a>  it's possible that, um, that that version of the ordinance parts of that version of the ordinance could be irrelevant. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4527.808s">But</a>  a lot of the work on rethinking 80 years has been done by local housing advocates. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4533.69s">Um,</a>  do y'all currently have that drafted? <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4537.613s">like</a>  sitting around somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4538.734s">I</a>  know that Danielle, we had a meeting about that.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4553.003s">Yes,</a>  I can dig that up and take a look at it and see what is applicable or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4558.827s">I</a>  remember some of the things was changing, which are already things we have to change anyways, which is <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4565.339s">eliminating</a>  the owner occupancy requirement in the affidavit. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4569.861s">And</a>  I'm trying to remember what else, what's the big changes in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4574.902s">I</a>  don't recall if we, if there was a discussion about making the detached ADUs by right, or if those- I wrote a blog about it on my website on May 5th.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4583.345s">I'd</a>  explored the topic specifically. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4586.486s">Parts</a>  of it were, it was like, <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4589.361s">the</a>  owner occupancy requirement I think was the was kind of the biggest like area of disagreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4594.243s">There</a>  were sort of good points on both sides about that and there is also like you know converting whether just like details of like converting a garage to an ADU versus like an attached ADU things like that but a lot of it should be in the draft of the the draft ordinance that we went over. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4617.069s">Although</a>  I do understand that it was <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4619.51s">many</a>  moons ago at this point that we last discussed that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4622.512s">But</a>  it is coming up on the timeline to get to that part of the discussion.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4627.135s">Yeah,</a>  so the good thing is we don't actually have to make that many changes to our ADU ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4633.98s">We</a>  just need to put in what are reasonable dimensional standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4637.723s">And</a>  one of the rules is that <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4639.852s">they</a>  can't be more restrictive than what we would have for a single family or a regular, you know, everyday accessory structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4649.76s">So</a>  if the setbacks for your accessory structure, which are three feet, then the ADU can only, can't be required to be more than three feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4660.628s">So</a>  you need to put those in. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4665.435s">You</a>  delete owner occupancy references and eliminate the special permit requirement for detached. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4675.167s">There</a>  was already a loophole where you could build an accessory structure and then <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4680.642s">come</a>  back the next day and say, I want to convert this to an ADU. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4683.404s">So</a>  it was kind of like a meaningless provision in an ordinance anyways about needing to only, you could only have a detached ADU if it was an existing structure you were converting. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4695.012s">But</a>  it was meaningless, as I was saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4698.754s">So</a>  just deleting that and then <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4702.357s">There</a>  will be the policy discussion of whether we would want to allow multiple ADUs on a lot by special permit, which is something that we can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4712.067s">And</a>  then also making it clear that they are not to be short-term rentals, or if <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4720.687s">If</a>  it's their primary dwelling, can they rent it out as a short-term rental, but not as an exclusive short-term rental? <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4725.811s">Because</a>  we definitely don't want that, because there's already so much damage to our neighborhoods from those.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4734.199s">So</a>  I'll just re-share the documents, because I'm actually looking at a document in my Google Drive which has <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4742.259s">a</a>  lot of edits from the both of us from almost a year ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4745.842s">So</a>  that probably is a good refresher, but it doesn't have to be re like we don't have to go and down the rabbit hole too much during the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4753.969s">But</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4756.151s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4757.272s">Go</a>  to President Bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4758.733s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4759.053s">And</a>  just on the short term rentals, I believe we updated that so that you can only do a maximum of 90 days a year anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4767.42s">So</a>  that might address <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4771.285s">parts</a>  of that question, at least.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4782.929s">But</a>  it depended on whether that was your primary dwelling. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4786.051s">So</a>  if you say if you have a two-family, you can't rent out the second unit as a short-term rental, because that's not actually your primary or your principal resident. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4797.015s">You're</a>  in one of the units, not the other one. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4800.076s">So</a>  there are some floating around that I believe, where there's a second unit that's just an Airbnb, like they no longer have long-term tenants. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4808.507s">So</a>  that's an enforcement thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4810.169s">But</a>  basically, the question would be if, say, you have a single-family house in an ADU, <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4817.097s">can</a>  you, the ADU, if it's not your primary or principal residence, the houses, can you rent out your ADU at a limited basis for short-term rentals? <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4828.906s">That's</a>  a policy decision that would have to be made that we would expressly state, because right now we just say your principal residence. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4836.131s">And</a>  is the ADU an extension of that? <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4838.333s">I</a>  don't know, but we should probably make it clear.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4840.775s">Yeah,</a>  no, that would make sense, because my inquisition would still fall under <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4846.329s">a</a>  90-day limit, but maybe they can make enough money in 90 days that it's worth it.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4863.717s">Anything</a>  additional on this, or were you just passing the mic back? <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4866.999s">Okay,</a>  great, just checking. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4872.021s">All</a>  right, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4872.962s">I</a>  think this has been a productive discussion on some of the <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4877.736s">some</a>  of the accessory topics that residential zoning gets into pretty quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4883.838s">So</a>  thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4885.058s">Lots</a>  of little threads to run down for next time, especially. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4887.379s">I</a>  think this is good timing as we start to get into the dimensionals, which we're going to be talking about next time, which will be our fourth meeting on the topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4893.781s">A</a>  good time to circle back to more of these topics. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4897.503s">Pell</a>  and Emily, was there another piece of the presentation that we should get to before, or did I</p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4905.971s">Yes,</a>  so I can go quickly through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4909.214s">It's</a>  just that we are starting to do an analysis on these commercial nodes for the residential neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4919.103s">So</a>  we are looking already at the existing <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4924.675s">So</a>  it's it might be a bit difficult to see because they are not a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4928.959s">But</a>  these red lots that you see over there in only the residential districts, these are already existing commercial, small commercial. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4941.978s">buildings.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4944.139s">So</a>  now what we are going to do is to study where we should have some notes in these residential areas to make also these conforming and that we can have a small scale commercial where you can have a small grocery store or we have to look into the uses that we will permit here. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4968.765s">but</a>  it's everything just very neighborhood, very small scale and obviously just to make a little cafe, bakery, small maybe co-working space or share space that were asked from the councillors and that we think it's a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4989.235s">So</a>  we are starting to look where we already have some of those commercial areas <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4994.198s">And</a>  how could we group them? <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4997.744s">And</a>  where are these good areas in this neighborhood, in this residential?</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5006.848s">And</a>  if I may, these are sort of the little nodes that we talked about when I first started planning somebody, another planner said hey did you know there's a five minute to ice cream rule and I don't think that's actually been standardized but the idea was that you should always be able to walk five minutes to ice cream which personally I think is a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5026.493s">But,</a>  you know, we've noticed that there's these scattered there's a little convenience store there's an upholster I think somewhere there's a little neighborhood cafe. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5035.496s">None</a>  of these to our knowledge are conforming now so the ability to make them conforming to allow further investment and then at kind of the appropriate cross points are or you know station along a longer street. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5049.6s">where</a>  could these be to allow something like that to happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5052.342s">It's</a>  primarily about what's existing now because they're there, we want to make it easier for them, but also just sort of thinking through how are they used by the neighborhood and how do we make that a better thing to do?</p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5068.793s">One</a>  thing that was cutting my eye was that they were usually very near a bus stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5075.64s">So</a>  they are usually along the some kind of transit route, and usually exactly where the bus stop is. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5084.048s">So</a>  we will look at these areas where it makes geographically sense and it's a note of two streets that are a little bit more wide or that have a little bit more activity or is because he's next to a park so it makes sense that we have a little bit of opportunity for the ice cream or the cafe.</p>
