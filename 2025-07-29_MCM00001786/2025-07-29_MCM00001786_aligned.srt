1
00:00:04,029 --> 00:00:06,951
So Deb, I know you don't have a vote, and I don't have a vote.

2
00:00:06,971 --> 00:00:08,712
Alex, do you have a vote?

3
00:00:08,732 --> 00:00:09,993
No.

4
00:00:10,493 --> 00:00:10,753
No?

5
00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:11,273
OK.

6
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:28,384
The only thing I can do if we don't have a quorum, because it's been officially posted in the three cities, I need to read the notice of the meeting, which I'll do, and call the roll, and then see where we're at at that point.

7
00:00:28,464 --> 00:00:31,425
But we'll give it another minute not to hold people up.

8
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,688
I know a couple of members couldn't make it.

9
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:16,417
Well, in the hopes that people will join us, I'll at least read into the record the notice of the meeting to move that portion along, and then we'll see where we're at once I read this paragraph.

10
00:01:16,757 --> 00:01:18,838
So notice of the meeting.

11
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:30,045
Notice is hereby given in accordance with Section 23A, Chapter 39 of the Massachusetts General Laws, that a virtual meeting of the Mystic Valley Commission will be held on Wednesday, July 23, 2025, at 2 p.m.

12
00:01:30,085 --> 00:01:30,886
On March 28, 2025, Governor Mara

13
00:01:36,191 --> 00:01:43,575
Healy signed legislation extending certain COVID-19 relief measures, including extending remote meetings for public bodies.

14
00:01:44,116 --> 00:01:51,180
The same provisions which permitted multi-member bodies to meet remotely or convene in a hybrid manner have been extended through June 30, 2027.

15
00:01:51,560 --> 00:02:02,026
This extension allows public bodies to continue to meet remotely or to meet in a hybrid manner without a quorum of the public body physically present at a meeting location

16
00:02:02,657 --> 00:02:07,579
as long as the public body provides adequate alternative means of access to remote meetings.

17
00:02:08,359 --> 00:02:11,120
This meeting will be conducted via remote participation.

18
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:22,744
This meeting will not include in-person attendance by members of the public, but all effort will be made to permit public attendance in the manner specified below via remote access by internet and telephone.

19
00:02:23,475 --> 00:02:36,478
Public access will also be provided by posting draft minutes and or transcript recording or record of the meeting on the City of Malden website at CityofMalden.org as soon as practicable after the meeting.

20
00:02:37,018 --> 00:02:43,439
Additional information and guidelines for the public can be found and it provides a team's link to the meeting.

21
00:02:43,619 --> 00:02:48,280
This notice, by the way, was also posted in the City of Medford and the City of Everett.

22
00:02:53,494 --> 00:03:00,556
So there are five members of the Mystic Valley Development Commission, including an additional, here comes somebody else.

23
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:14,740
I did just hear that there are, I think Jared and I think perhaps Jeff was also on another team's link.

24
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,301
So let me figure that out.

25
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:19,862
You know what to do, Alex, is the issue is that

26
00:03:22,961 --> 00:03:31,965
Well you need to click on the link itself that's in the email that Deb sent and not on the Microsoft Teams link.

27
00:03:33,006 --> 00:03:34,266
She sent the URL.

28
00:03:35,307 --> 00:03:35,887
I had to.

29
00:03:35,987 --> 00:03:37,528
I didn't know how to deal with it.

30
00:03:37,548 --> 00:03:38,228
That's what I did.

31
00:03:38,689 --> 00:03:42,250
So that's what I had done and there's a few people on that call.

32
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:46,653
I'm going to leave that call.

33
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:48,874
I'll jump over there, Deb, and just let people know.

34
00:03:48,894 --> 00:03:51,335
I'll jump back in a minute.

35
00:03:52,527 --> 00:03:53,247
Yeah, thanks.

36
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:53,768
Hey, Tom.

37
00:03:54,508 --> 00:03:54,968
Hey, Jeff.

38
00:03:57,509 --> 00:04:00,971
We also have a guest, the Medford Community Media here.

39
00:04:01,471 --> 00:04:07,234
So what's been done so far, Jeff, is I've read the notice of the meeting, just to move that part along.

40
00:04:07,294 --> 00:04:09,815
And then we're waiting to see if members joined.

41
00:04:09,835 --> 00:04:10,856
Very good.

42
00:04:13,377 --> 00:04:13,677
Thank you.

43
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:11,771
Hi, Jared.

44
00:05:12,672 --> 00:05:13,493
Hello, how are you?

45
00:05:14,054 --> 00:05:14,554
Hi, Cheryl.

46
00:05:14,895 --> 00:05:15,375
Hi, Tim.

47
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:16,737
Hello.

48
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:17,819
Hi, Tom, how are you?

49
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,200
Good, yourself?

50
00:05:19,921 --> 00:05:20,662
Good, thank you.

51
00:05:23,526 --> 00:05:24,267
Sorry about that.

52
00:05:24,307 --> 00:05:27,632
We all follow the same join the meeting now link evidently.

53
00:05:29,598 --> 00:05:31,739
Alex, did you see Kevin Foley on there at 1.2?

54
00:05:31,819 --> 00:05:42,622
I saw that he was trying to- I guess it was when that calendar event got sent out, it automatically added its own one, so that's probably where- Yeah, Kevin was on the meeting with us.

55
00:05:43,923 --> 00:05:51,385
He was, and I forwarded him that link, so he should be arriving shortly.

56
00:05:51,545 --> 00:05:55,047
What would be the method up top, that method community media link?

57
00:05:55,087 --> 00:05:56,567
We've already asked that question.

58
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:57,848
It's method community media.

59
00:05:57,908 --> 00:05:58,788
They're probably going to be

60
00:05:59,472 --> 00:05:59,972
taping this.

61
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:02,233
We told them if they are, they have to disclose it.

62
00:06:03,114 --> 00:06:07,656
But other than we started, we didn't start the meeting, but I read the notice.

63
00:06:07,716 --> 00:06:08,276
I guess we did.

64
00:06:08,296 --> 00:06:12,518
I read the notice of the meeting into the record to move that piece along.

65
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:16,940
Hi Kevin.

66
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:20,822
Sorry for any confusion on the link.

67
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:31,982
Um, so I've read the notice of the meeting into the record, which talks about the ability to do remote meetings under, you know, legislation with Governor Maura Haley.

68
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:39,305
So, um, at this point I want to call the roll, um, because this has been advertised in all three meetings.

69
00:06:39,845 --> 00:06:45,887
And as you know, we need, um, five members of the commission present in order to carry out business.

70
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:50,369
So I will start with Brianna Lungo Kern.

71
00:06:54,464 --> 00:06:55,704
We'll note her as absent.

72
00:06:56,605 --> 00:06:58,606
Carlo DeMaria, mayor of Everett.

73
00:07:00,266 --> 00:07:01,607
We'll note him as absent.

74
00:07:03,428 --> 00:07:07,349
Justin Quinn, member representing the city of Malden.

75
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:09,890
We'll note him absent.

76
00:07:11,991 --> 00:07:14,672
Colleen Mejia, representing the city of Everett.

77
00:07:15,492 --> 00:07:18,394
We'll note him, her, excuse me, absent as well.

78
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:21,915
And Jared, yeah, I'm going to do this one.

79
00:07:21,955 --> 00:07:22,795
Is it Yajian?

80
00:07:22,815 --> 00:07:23,756
You got it.

81
00:07:23,816 --> 00:07:24,276
That's good.

82
00:07:24,643 --> 00:07:25,423
Great, okay.

83
00:07:26,844 --> 00:07:27,284
You're here.

84
00:07:27,304 --> 00:07:28,424
I am here.

85
00:07:29,465 --> 00:07:29,765
All right.

86
00:07:30,545 --> 00:07:34,366
And Mara Haley's representative is in absence too.

87
00:07:35,487 --> 00:07:48,291
So not having a sufficient number of members on hand to conduct business, I think we need to, I don't know if we just table the meeting or adjourn the meeting.

88
00:07:48,311 --> 00:07:54,373
We're going to have to reschedule this meeting at some point, but I don't, maybe we table it until

89
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,993
The chair calls another meeting of the commission.

90
00:07:58,013 --> 00:07:59,534
I think that's appropriate.

91
00:08:00,535 --> 00:08:00,855
Okay.

92
00:08:01,816 --> 00:08:02,036
All right.

93
00:08:02,056 --> 00:08:12,066
So that's what we'll do it, you know, whatever time it is, uh, two 11, we're going to, um, you know, table the meeting because there wasn't a sufficient quorum until the chair calls the next meeting.

94
00:08:12,086 --> 00:08:13,627
Okay.

95
00:08:13,907 --> 00:08:14,968
Thank you very much.

96
00:08:15,068 --> 00:08:15,429
Thank you.

97
00:08:15,449 --> 00:08:15,929
All right.

98
00:08:15,949 --> 00:08:16,830
Thank you everybody.

99
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:17,450
Thank you.
