    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=4.029">So</a>  Deb, I know you don't have a vote, and I don't have a vote. <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=6.971">Alex,</a>  do you have a vote? <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=8.732">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=10.493">No?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=10.933">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=14.055">The</a>  only thing I can do if we don't have a quorum, because it's been officially posted in the three cities, I need to read the notice of the meeting, which I'll do, and call the roll, and then see where we're at at that point. <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=28.464">But</a>  we'll give it another minute not to hold people up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=34.02">I</a>  know a couple of members couldn't make it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=66.17">Well,</a>  in the hopes that people will join us, I'll at least read into the record the notice of the meeting to move that portion along, and then we'll see where we're at once I read this paragraph. <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=76.757">So</a>  notice of the meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=79.479">Notice</a>  is hereby given in accordance with Section 23A, Chapter 39 of the Massachusetts General Laws, that a virtual meeting of the Mystic Valley Commission will be held on Wednesday, July 23, 2025, at 2 p.m. <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=90.085">On</a>  March 28, 2025, Governor Mara <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=96.191">Healy</a>  signed legislation extending certain COVID-19 relief measures, including extending remote meetings for public bodies. <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=104.116">The</a>  same provisions which permitted multi-member bodies to meet remotely or convene in a hybrid manner have been extended through June 30, 2027. <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=111.56">This</a>  extension allows public bodies to continue to meet remotely or to meet in a hybrid manner without a quorum of the public body physically present at a meeting location <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=122.657">as</a>  long as the public body provides adequate alternative means of access to remote meetings. <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=128.359">This</a>  meeting will be conducted via remote participation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=131.58">This</a>  meeting will not include in-person attendance by members of the public, but all effort will be made to permit public attendance in the manner specified below via remote access by internet and telephone. <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=143.475">Public</a>  access will also be provided by posting draft minutes and or transcript recording or record of the meeting on the City of Malden website at CityofMalden.org as soon as practicable after the meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=157.018">Additional</a>  information and guidelines for the public can be found and it provides a team's link to the meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=163.619">This</a>  notice, by the way, was also posted in the City of Medford and the City of Everett. <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=173.494">So</a>  there are five members of the Mystic Valley Development Commission, including an additional, here comes somebody else.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=184.117">I</a>  did just hear that there are, I think Jared and I think perhaps Jeff was also on another team's link. <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=194.92">So</a>  let me figure that out.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=196.321">You</a>  know what to do, Alex, is the issue is that <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=202.961">Well</a>  you need to click on the link itself that's in the email that Deb sent and not on the Microsoft Teams link. <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=213.006">She</a>  sent the URL.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=215.307">I</a>  had to. <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=215.987">I</a>  didn't know how to deal with it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=217.548">That's</a>  what I did.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=218.689">So</a>  that's what I had done and there's a few people on that call.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=222.51">I'm</a>  going to leave that call. <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=226.833">I'll</a>  jump over there, Deb, and just let people know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=228.894">I'll</a>  jump back in a minute. <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=232.527">Yeah,</a>  thanks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=233.367">Hey,</a>  Tom. <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=234.508">Hey,</a>  Jeff.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=331.819">I</a>  saw that he was trying to- I guess it was when that calendar event got sent out, it automatically added its own one, so that's probably where- Yeah, Kevin was on the meeting with us.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=343.923">He</a>  was, and I forwarded him that link, so he should be arriving shortly.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=355.087">We've</a>  already asked that question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=356.647">It's</a>  method community media. <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=357.908">They're</a>  probably going to be <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=359.472">taping</a>  this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=359.992">We</a>  told them if they are, they have to disclose it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=363.114">But</a>  other than we started, we didn't start the meeting, but I read the notice. <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=367.716">I</a>  guess we did. <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=368.296">I</a>  read the notice of the meeting into the record to move that piece along. <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=372.538">Hi</a>  Kevin. <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=378.921">Sorry</a>  for any confusion on the link. <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=382.979">Um,</a>  so I've read the notice of the meeting into the record, which talks about the ability to do remote meetings under, you know, legislation with Governor Maura Haley. <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=392.683">So,</a>  um, at this point I want to call the roll, um, because this has been advertised in all three meetings. <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=399.845">And</a>  as you know, we need, um, five members of the commission present in order to carry out business. <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=407.208">So</a>  I will start with Breanna Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=414.464">We'll</a>  note her as absent. <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=416.605">Carlo</a>  DeMaria, mayor of Everett. <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=420.266">We'll</a>  note him as absent. <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=423.428">Justin</a>  Quinn, member representing the city of Malden. <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=428.81">We'll</a>  note him absent. <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=431.991">Colleen</a>  Mejia, representing the city of Everett. <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=435.492">We'll</a>  note him, her, excuse me, absent as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=439.314">And</a>  Jared, yeah, I'm going to do this one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=441.955">Is</a>  it Yajian?

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=492.086">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/mystic-valley-development-commission-07-23-25&start=493.907">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>
