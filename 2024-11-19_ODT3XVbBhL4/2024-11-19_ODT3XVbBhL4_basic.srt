9
00:03:30,563 --> 00:03:49,379
To the Honorable President and members of the Memphis City Council, City Hall, Memphis, Massachusetts 02155, dear Mr. President and city councilors. I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body reprogram surplus proceeds in the amount of $112,692.73.

10
00:03:49,379 --> 00:04:18,590
From the Medford High School HVAC Boiler Replacement Project to Medford High School Improvements Projects in accordance with Master General Law Chapter 44, Section 20. Finance Director Alicia Donnelly Benjamin is present to answer any of the council's questions regarding this matter. Sincerely, Brianna Longo Kern, Mayor. Let's see, we had, let's see, I believe Councilor Knight wanted to speak on that. Councilor Knight? I do believe Councilor Caballero was the moving party taken off the table, Mr. President.

11
00:04:19,838 --> 00:04:48,307
My apologies, Vice President Caviello. Yes, Mr. President. If we could take that off the table. That paper has been taken from the table. Oh, I'm sorry. 20516, also. Second. Do you want to vote on this one first? Yes. OK. So are you making a motion to approve? Yes. OK. On the motion to approve, 20-517. Second. Mr. President, Mr. President, is Jonathan available, Mr. President? OK, on the motion of counselor.

12
00:04:48,745 --> 00:05:10,598
Is John McLaughlin available, the facilities director? Let's see, is John McLaughlin on the phone? Or actually, is he on the meeting? If he's not on the meeting, we can wait until later on in the meeting. We have our superintendent of schools is with us as well. She's John's boss, so she should probably be.

13
00:05:11,122 --> 00:05:31,439
Do you have a question for the superintendent? I do. I'd just like to give us a breakdown as to where funds are going to be expended. That was the reason why we tabled it last week. Thank you. So let's see. On the motion of Vice President Caviello, seconded by Councilor Behrs. And we have the superintendent of schools with us. Let's see. Dr. Marie Sedgwick-Vincent.

14
00:05:32,435 --> 00:05:50,727
I believe.

15
00:05:50,727 --> 00:06:11,078
and other members of my team, Dave Murphy, Dr. Peter Cushing, and possibly Suzanne Galussi as well. So we are prepared to respond to any questions that you may have regarding the,

16
00:06:12,226 --> 00:06:27,582
the proposals for how we would recommend spending this money to advance work that needs to be done in all of the buildings for a safe opening of schools. Excellent. Thank you.

17
00:06:27,582 --> 00:06:44,558
Thank you, Dr. Vincent. I appreciate you being here. Now, these funds, this $800 and somewhat thousand dollars, these funds are for capital improvements, correct? They're not for any personnel. They can't bring reading specialists back into the classroom or anything like that, right? These are just for capital expenses?

18
00:06:44,913 --> 00:07:11,086
Yes, absolutely not for personnel. The request for these funds are to improve our infrastructure, in particular around the areas of air exchange, air quality, to get our buildings up to air balancing, all of those things that are currently working to try to fix to make sure that our buildings

19
00:07:11,086 --> 00:07:33,293
are up and running and safe for a smooth reopening of schools. Right, but so the council's tabling of this item did not prevent the school department from bringing any teachers or any classroom teachers back, is that correct? That is correct. Excellent, thank you. Because sometimes there's a lot of misinformation that travels around the community, and that was something that was going around. So I just wanted to be sure, Dr. Vincent, that we were all clear.

20
00:07:33,293 --> 00:07:58,302
that the funds here that were tabled by the council at the last meeting were for capital funds only. But the council did last meeting, I believe, increase the school department's budget by $1.08 million that would allow for those positions to be restored. Is that correct? That is correct. Excellent. And after last week's meeting, I did have the opportunity to pick up the phone and make a telephone call to John McLaughlin. And I spoke with John at length and he explained to me the situation at the high school especially.

21
00:07:58,302 --> 00:08:23,075
relative to the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system. He also explained to me that there were some air quality tests that were conducted that came back. And for the most part, all of our schools came back with very good reviews, with the exception of one. And I think we all know what school that is, Medford High School. So with that being said, Dr. Vincent, could you tell us a little bit about the scope of work that you're looking to spend this $800 and some odd thousand dollars on, please?

22
00:08:23,497 --> 00:08:42,953
Yes, so there is a significant scope of work that does need to be done in particular if we focus on the high school, which is the oldest building in the district outside of the Curtis Tufts. But the high school being 50 years old has older rooms, more eighth graders.

23
00:08:44,000 --> 00:09:11,776
some pains, if I can say that. And so there are areas that definitely need immediate attention in the HVAC area. And so we're currently, WB Engineering is currently conducting, completed their first report on the building of the high school and what they would make recommendations for in the area of HVAC. We also have,

24
00:09:12,232 --> 00:09:35,384
UEC universal environmentalists coming in who are also looking at air quality and air balancing and we also have Precision, another engineering group that is continuing to look at how our HVAC systems function and work for the district. So with all of the different

25
00:09:36,093 --> 00:09:50,774
engineering companies that have been coming in, the cost is truly significant. For example, at the high school on the roof, to repair the fans that are on the roof, which are part of the exhaust

26
00:09:50,926 --> 00:10:20,913
system, HVAC system. We have approximately $150,000 worth of work on the roof alone, addressing fans and making sure that they are all properly functioning at their maximum speed and able to deliver and support intake and outtake in the building. In addition, from WB Engineering's initial report,

27
00:10:20,913 --> 00:10:40,117
on the high school based on the mitigation strategies that they recommended. We're talking about prices that would exceed $200,000 at the high school complex alone. And the other off-campus buildings are still being assessed as we speak.

28
00:10:40,117 --> 00:10:57,582
and so we are waiting for those reports to finish being completed. Some of that money also because, again, this building is 50 years old. Prior to the official ADA changes that newer buildings had to have to be properly

29
00:10:57,582 --> 00:11:16,921
handicapped, accessible. We wanted to set aside approximately $50,000 to $100,000 to support making the entrance to the high school ADA compliant. There is a ramp there that vehicles go up and down, but for people in wheelchairs,

30
00:11:17,461 --> 00:11:37,694
it is not fully compliant. And so those are some of the things that we want to be able to use these monies for. And as the other buildings are continued, are presently still being assessed, we anticipate that there will continue to be, you know, significant

31
00:11:37,694 --> 00:11:54,552
requirements from the district to be able to mitigate all of these HVAC challenges that could present themselves in order for us to be able to get schools up and running as quickly as possible.

32
00:11:54,822 --> 00:12:22,953
I also want to say to the entire body that we, as the work is being done, we are prepared and fully wanting to come back and share with both you and the school committee the progress of the work that's being done, the status of the work, and where we are in terms of using this funding to remedy the HVAC challenges that have presented themselves.

33
00:12:25,501 --> 00:12:46,122
And in terms of total cost for us to bring our HVAC system at Medford High School into compliance and I guess efficient and effective working order. Is this $816 enough money to do that or will there be a request for a supplemental appropriation at a later date going forward?

34
00:12:46,544 --> 00:12:59,521
So at this point in time, we are optimistic that this will allow us to address the high school. We don't know, again,

35
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:28,276
You know, we can't, I cannot definitively say that I will not need to come and ask your body for additional funding. Our hope is that the 816,000 will allow us to be able to address all of the key challenges with HVAC systems, in particular at the high school, that we would be able to remedy all of the things that were recommended in the reports.

36
00:13:29,626 --> 00:13:58,330
And is it still the wishes of the committee to have this account be exclusive to Medford High School only and to the other schools? We would hope that this could be for the high school and if needed for, we know the outside schools are much younger, they're 20 years younger. However, we may need to spend purchasing additional HEPA filters and

37
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:25,111
We would hope to be able to use this funding not only at the high school, but potentially at some of the outside schools as well. That would be our hope if other things were to surface. But we know, we're fully aware that the high school needs significant work and that the lion's share of that funding definitely would be spent at the high school complex.

38
00:14:25,803 --> 00:14:53,731
The reason I raise the question is because the way that the paper was drafted was that it would be reprogramming the funds to an account exclusive to Medford High School. And I know maybe Alicia's on the call, maybe Alicia can elaborate a little bit on that. But I do believe that when it was presented that those funds were restricted exclusively to Medford High School and were not going to be allowed to be used in other schools in the district. If I'm mistaken, please correct me. But maybe Ms. Nunley can help us out with that.

39
00:14:55,182 --> 00:15:10,893
I also have Mister Murphy, David Murphy on the line. He's on the call as well. And he may be able to weigh in on that. Again, as the numbers are coming in, we know for certain, the roof fans,

40
00:15:11,652 --> 00:15:32,493
At the high school, it's going to be a significant investment. And if the funds need to be spent exclusively at the high school, that there is so much work, capital projects, including additional bathrooms and those kinds of things that need to be renovated and updated, that I'm sure that we would be able to use all of this funding in short order.

41
00:15:34,568 --> 00:15:54,667
So it's the committee's, the school department's wishes to keep the paper as is and not amend it and allow it for just MHS only because it's only $800,000 and you can spend that all up at the high school, no problem. If it is possible to allow if

42
00:15:55,274 --> 00:16:13,195
If there was something that were to come up at one of the other schools and we had to take a very limited amount from this $800,000 to support the other buildings, if that was a possibility, I would ask this body to allow us

43
00:16:13,195 --> 00:16:39,655
the additional flexibility to be able to use it throughout all of the schools. But if that would be problematic, then I would just say leave it for the high school because we know that there is plenty of work that can be done. It's certainly not a problem for me. The paper came from the administration, so maybe Alicia Nunley, my finance director, can talk a little bit about that.

44
00:16:40,077 --> 00:17:00,682
We have the eye. If I may be a chief of staff, Dave Rodriguez has his hand raised. So at this point, I'd recognize chief of staff Rodriguez. So like, I'm happy to answer on her behalf. The reason the paper was drafted in this manner was that it just mirrored the original use of the

45
00:17:05,204 --> 00:17:31,900
to high school use. The administration and the mayor are completely in support of removing the high school aspect of that and have it be applicable to the rest of the public school system and the rest of the buildings there. My understanding, after speaking with Alicia, is that this is completely improper and that it's completely in line with what the administration can do with these funding. So we'd have to amend the paper?

46
00:17:39,747 --> 00:17:59,542
Mr. President, I would offer that in the form of a motion to amend the paper to reflect that these funds can be used across the school district, not just exclusive to Medford High School. Second. On the motion of Councilor Knight to amend the paper, seconded by Councilor Scott Kelly. Clerk, do you have the wording on that? On the amendment? I second.

47
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:24,263
So Councilor Knight's amendment is to allow the schools to use the funds across the school district, not just at the high school. That is correct. Correct. Councilor Knight, do you have any further questions? That's it for me, sir. Thank you. Thank you, Councilor Knight. Councilor Marks.

48
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:50,403
Thank you, Mr. President, and I thank the superintendent for being on the call tonight and the administrative staff. The email we received today talks about WB engineering report and that the amount to look at ventilation air quality, air exchange would significantly exceed $200,000. I was just wondering,

49
00:18:53,120 --> 00:19:00,612
regarding the 200,000, is that particularly to the high school or is that in general across the board?

50
00:19:00,899 --> 00:19:23,731
Yes, this first report that was released by WB Engineering was exclusively to high school. And so, that $200,000 to exceed the $200,000 was just for some of the mitigation work that needs to be done exclusively at the high school. We have not received,

51
00:19:23,731 --> 00:19:53,093
all of the remaining engineering reports for the remaining outside schools, because the high school being the largest building takes the most time. Okay, so Madam Superintendent, you mentioned the roof fans. At Medford High School, I guess roughly 100 roof fans at an estimated cost of $125,000. Is that part of this $200,000 that's listed as WB engineering report?

52
00:19:54,730 --> 00:20:21,916
So that $150,000 was in addition, I believe that the amount of the 150,000 was for the repairing of the roof fans. And then there are other mitigation strategies, which could potentially include HECA filters and those kinds of things. It's likely to not exceed 200,000. And I, again, significantly exceed that.

53
00:20:22,034 --> 00:20:48,933
But I, again, I do have David Murphy on the call and John McLaughlin, so I don't know if Clerk Hurtubise could unmute them so they could weigh in as well. Okay, I'm about to unmute John McLaughlin. Okay, John, you've been unmuted, and David Murphy has been unmuted as well. David Murphy? I'm sorry, David Murphy, I apologize.

54
00:20:55,008 --> 00:21:23,003
Councilman Marks, did you have a specific question for John McLaughlin? My question is regarding the $200,000 that was mentioned within the email we got today and also a previous email we received from the mayor. It mentioned that each classroom needed these filters at $1,500 a piece, but it didn't mention how many classrooms and if it was just the high school or if it was classrooms across the entire city.

55
00:21:23,358 --> 00:21:39,338
I think I can respond to that, and I would ask Mr. McLaughlin to jump in. For those of you who don't know, I'm the assistant superintendent for finance and operations. I began work with the Medford Public Schools approximately three weeks ago, and so I've been clinging to John to try to get my own

56
00:21:42,173 --> 00:22:06,406
I think for this particular question, I can answer and I'd ask John to fill in the details. So where we are right now is we have the initial assessment from WB Engineering of Medford High School. There is a tremendous amount of information in that report. We've been working with WB and have additional meetings scheduled with them in the coming days to make a determination as to which of the mitigation strategies

57
00:22:06,406 --> 00:22:31,297
that they have identified in that report should be utilized. It looks to us like an estimate or a middle of the road approach to the work that they have acknowledged could be useful is somewhere in the vicinity of $200,000. That's where that estimate came from. The rough estimate of the $150,000 is specific to the work that is estimated needs to be done

58
00:22:32,410 --> 00:23:01,503
that we're looking at over $400,000 of potential work that has been identified, but the $200,000 number, the potential assess mitigation strategies at Medford High School, a comparable report has not yet been done at the other schools. The reason for that is we are currently testing both for air quality and

59
00:23:03,612 --> 00:23:13,214
for that expense is also also

60
00:23:16,302 --> 00:23:43,842
And then once we have the data from that testing, we'll be in a better position to determine whether or not we should commission a similar assessment at the other schools, the way we have for Bedford High School. And it says in the memo that there is a, we understand there's an unusual sequence to having already received recommendations with regard to mitigation strategies at the high school, while the testing across the district, both at the high school and other schools,

61
00:23:43,842 --> 00:24:06,809
And the reason for that is the high school is a unique entity, both with regard to its size, its age, and the complexity of its systems. And so we pushed forward with that study right away. And we solicited proposals. We have already three proposals to do similar work at the other schools. And we're going to hold off on actually commissioning that and making that investment until we actually have the data back from the testing that's currently being done.

62
00:24:08,648 --> 00:24:32,662
So through you, Mr. President, when was the WB engineering study commissioned by the school department and voted on by the school committee? I'd have to defer on the vote of the school committee question, but it was commissioned, I believe, on the week of August 17th. Potentially August 25th. It was in that range.

63
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:56,472
Is there a particular reason why the school district waited so long to commission an air quality study? I think the point that is, I think we should sort of preface all of this commentary with is that we actually have no evidence right now that there is anything wrong with the air quality. Frankly, I understand there's a history and there have been some persistent questions, but

64
00:24:56,472 --> 00:25:24,130
to make sure that we provide as much defense against any type of virus transmission. But I think there's been a

65
00:25:25,025 --> 00:25:45,376
Right. And when did we find out there's hot evidence now that says the quality of air is fine? To be candid, I don't have any evidence that that is the case. I think it's an attempt to, given the context and the anxiety that folks are feeling, trying to be as responsive as possible to some of the concerns that have been raised. Right.

66
00:25:45,376 --> 00:26:07,820
Right, so I'm just wondering why for the past six months, the school administration, knowing that eventually we're going to have faculty, students, staff back within our public schools. Over the last six months, didn't realize that a first step would have been to do an air quality test within the schools.

67
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:29,572
And I'm not sure why it took so long to do that. But putting that aside, Mr. President, this was tabled two weeks ago. And one of the motions made by the council was to ask the administration and the school committee for a list of their priorities.

68
00:26:29,572 --> 00:26:54,040
Because at the time we heard of a number of priorities. One being ventilation, air quality, air exchange in order to provide a healthy and safe building. But we also heard about handicapped ramps accessibility. We also heard about the condition of our restrooms within the school department and a number of other concerns as well, Mr. President.

69
00:26:54,040 --> 00:27:09,143
We just recently received an email from the mayor stating that if we could release the funds, they're also looking to use some of the funds for beautification purposes in the main entrance.

70
00:27:09,143 --> 00:27:28,027
which I know firsthand that that is something that's needed, Mr. President. I was part of the crew that painted that several months back under the leadership of Bill Carr Jr. and a number of volunteers, so I know that's needed. But I believe, and I can't speak for my colleagues,

71
00:27:28,027 --> 00:27:56,005
Why we asked for a priority list was to make sure that we had a reasonable assessment, Mr. President, on what are we going to do to get our children, and our teachers, and our faculty, and our staff back into a safe building. And to me, beautification of a front entrance is probably at the bottom of the list. And air quality, and air exchange, and ventilation, and other priorities, Mr. President, would be at the top of the list.

72
00:27:56,005 --> 00:28:12,813
And that's what I was hoping to receive from the administration and the school committee. And to be quite frank, I am very disappointed that we didn't even get a response, Mr. President, from the council motion that was two weeks ago. That was from August 25th.

73
00:28:12,813 --> 00:28:37,349
Unless I'm mistaken, I have yet to receive anything, Mr. President. That's not to say that I realize that work needs to be done in that building. But it would be helpful, Mr. President, if we're going to work in cooperation with the school side, that if we have requests, that they recognize and honor our request, Mr. President, as well.

74
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:56,148
I have no problem allotting money, Mr. President, but I'd like to know what it's going to go towards. Now, if we free up $800,000 tonight to go into this fund, there's no saying that they won't end up doing beautification over ventilation.

75
00:28:56,570 --> 00:29:17,917
I would hope that's not the case, Mr. President. And clearly, if there are 100 fans that are currently not working on the roof, you can almost bet your bottom dollar the air quality and circulation in that building is not good, Mr. President. So this is not rocket science. They're already coming out saying they have to

76
00:29:17,917 --> 00:29:35,602
can't change out all the filters, the fans on the roof aren't working, over 100 fans. That's what circulates air within a building. That's what provides proper air quality and air exchange and ventilation. So those are the concerns I have, Mr. President.

77
00:29:35,602 --> 00:30:00,492
And maybe if the superintendent or someone else from the administration can assure us that if we do release money tonight, that the priority is to get people back into the building. And to make sure that the air quality and the safety of our students, and our teachers, and our staff, and our faculty is the number one priority, Mr. President. And then we can look at other needs.

78
00:30:00,492 --> 00:30:28,083
My other point, Mr. President, is two weeks ago, Alicia Nunley represented to us when we took the vote that there was other money available. I believe I asked the question, because it was led to believe that if we didn't vote two weeks ago, that we were stalling students from getting back into the building. And I asked Alicia Nunley that question, and she said, there are CARES Act money available, and there's COVID-19 funds.

79
00:30:28,083 --> 00:30:46,139
that are available to work with the air quality and safety concerns. So that's why I voted the way I did, Mr. President, knowing that there's other additional funds out there. And that the fact that I want to make sure as one member that if we're going to allot money,

80
00:30:47,118 --> 00:31:06,052
that it go into the safety of our faculty, students, and kids, Mr. President. And I'm sure the school committee and the administration share the concerns, but if we're going to be responsible for allocating this money, like every other paper, Mr. President, it'd be nice to have a paper in front of us.

81
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:29,002
And I received an email today that I just happened to be able to take a look at just briefly, but I still haven't seen anything that prioritizes work. And I realize the testing is still underway and current, but that's why I felt that if this happened two, three, four months ago,

82
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:58,195
Don't forget the money that was in this account from the science labs, the 700,000, that's been sitting in the account for five years, Mr. President. Think about it. We could have moved that money in for restrooms in the high school for the past five years, for working water bubblers. You name it, Mr. President, what's needed in that high school. So this is money that could have been used over the past five years.

83
00:31:59,056 --> 00:32:25,415
So those are the concerns I have, Mr. President. If the superintendent can assure me tonight that this money will be prioritized for the reopening and the ventilation and air quality and air exchange and safety concerns over aesthetics and beautification at this particular stage, I will give it a vote tonight. If not, Mr. President, I will not move forward. Thank you.

84
00:32:27,085 --> 00:32:50,879
Yes, I can assure Councilor Marks and the entire council that our intention is to get the buildings up and running as quickly as possible so that we can have students return. That is our highest priority. The concerns about the ADA, which I did mention, accessibility at the front of the high school, that is something that has always been a concern.

85
00:32:50,879 --> 00:33:12,395
a concern and so in fixing the ADA ramps at the front of the high school, the main entrance, at the same time that that's being fixed, in essence, you would be able to fix the school aesthetically by making it more handicap accessible and doing the work that needs to be done there.

86
00:33:12,395 --> 00:33:28,662
But again, our priority is to be able to get the school up and running, meeting the HVAC standards and proper air ventilation in the entire complex. We want students to be safe. We want our staff to be safe.

87
00:33:28,662 --> 00:33:58,008
everyone coming to work into the building to be safe. So that is our highest priority. And I can assure you as the entire council, that that's what we can focus on. Again, we are also willing to come before you as we continue to get additional reports. And as work is being done to come and update the council on the status of the work and how much of the money has been spent as well, as we continue to do the same for the school committee.

88
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:27,421
But I do want to stress that this funding will be a tremendous help to the schools and allow us to be able to open and get kids back in the schools as quickly as possible. Thank you, Superintendent Edward. Vincent, thank you, Councilor Marks. We have up next, Vice President Carviello and then Councilor Morrell. Vice President. Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, over eight years ago,

89
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:53,290
I brought up the heating and ventilation of all the schools with the exception of the high school. And so again, this is not a new problem. This has been going on long before the COVID came in. What is the plan to address those schools that have been, for all those units that haven't been operating in there for many years, Madam Superintendent?

90
00:34:53,712 --> 00:35:20,982
Last year, for example, we did a lot of work on some of the outside buildings. I know the Columbus, we had a lot of units that were updated and if something wasn't working, there were a lot of repairs that were made to the outside schools. And so we are committed to having all buildings fully functioning, the outside buildings with their air conditioning and their heating to be working.

91
00:35:20,982 --> 00:35:48,539
So we are committed to doing that, and that work has been ongoing. Now, what about the air quality in those buildings, Madam Superintendent? So the air quality in all of the outside buildings, they are currently still being assessed right now. Again, as I had said earlier, the high school being the largest complex, essentially the other schools can all fit into the high school complex.

92
00:35:48,944 --> 00:36:15,590
that this building took the longest amount of time. And the engineers from the different engineering companies, they are out in the field right now doing the assessments on the outside buildings as well. So that is ongoing work. Madam Superintendent, how are we addressing the inequality issues in the high school with the classrooms that are on the inside of the corridor with no windows?

93
00:36:16,467 --> 00:36:43,957
So exactly, that is a great question. So we are fully aware of the classrooms that do not have any windows at all, the inner classrooms in B building and C building, B building on the second floor. And so there are some classrooms that we are looking to take offline and there are other classrooms where what would be appropriate would be to put in the,

94
00:36:45,340 --> 00:37:10,940
HEPA filters in other classrooms. Can you give me like five minutes? Yep. To put in air quality in the HEPA filters in the other buildings to be able to, those rooms, to be able to increase the air quality in that space. Will you be utilizing some of the theaters in that building, the study halls?

95
00:37:11,918 --> 00:37:40,471
For the study halls, if they met the air quality standard, once all of the spaces meet the correct standard, every space will be able to be used. If there's an area that it can't be used, we were given suggestions to mitigate that. So whether it's looking at the windows or adding HEPA filters,

96
00:37:40,471 --> 00:38:01,379
but to increase the air ventilation and air circulation. Once we establish a list and do the repairs to the high school, is there talk about bringing on a company on retainer to monitor these on a regular basis?

97
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:19,216
not just do it and walk away, but have a company that'll come in there, have somebody on retainer to constantly monitor these classrooms. because I'm sure those filters are going to need to be replaced on a constant basis. So is that something in the plans?

98
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:49,355
It is, one of the suggestions that we already have in plans is to increase, normally filters were changed twice a year and we're gonna increase that and double the filters being changed. So there are steps that we have already begun to put in place that we're gonna use moving forward to help all of the schools and to just keep a high level of air quality for everyone, all staff working and students in the Medford Public Schools.

99
00:38:50,148 --> 00:38:56,830
And as far as the bathrooms that we've been talking about for many years, what's going to be happening with those?

100
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:21,603
So we would definitely like to upgrade and renovate the bathrooms, and that's still on our list to get that work done. But for right now, we really are prioritizing HVAC systems, the air quality, et cetera, testing. So that's our biggest priority first, and then we will definitely be tackling the bathrooms as well.

101
00:39:21,704 --> 00:39:40,570
And I will echo my fellow council's remarks is I'd like to see a list, a detailed list of what's going on versus just talking about it. So if we can get that to us as soon as possible, that would be greatly appreciated, even though we asked for it a couple of weeks ago.

102
00:39:41,752 --> 00:40:11,317
So the reports that were shared today were some of just the preliminary reports that we have. We don't have other reports as of yet because the testing is still ongoing. But as soon as we have additional reports to share, we will gladly share that with the entire council. And one last question, which is kind of a, what would the school department have done if we didn't find this $800,000?

103
00:40:13,156 --> 00:40:33,895
Where would this funding come from? I mean, it's kind of- It would have been a tremendous challenge, and we would have needed to ask for additional support. All right, well, thank you. Thank you, Vice President Carbiel. Councilor Morrell.

104
00:40:36,460 --> 00:41:00,524
Thank you, Mr. President. I want to thank members of the school administration for being here tonight. I understand the acute and immediate need of the schools in this time as far as preparing for the safest possible environment, and I also understand just the need to be agile and responsive in these times, especially when metrics and goalposts keep shifting. So I thank you for your work on this, and I do hope we can move this paper forward tonight. My question is,

105
00:41:00,524 --> 00:41:24,773
Councilor Marks touched on this a bit about the HEPA filters, the $1,500 HEPA filters that are mentioned. And I apologize if I missed this, but is there a ballpark number of the number of these we might need? So as we are waiting on the additional reports from the outside schools as well,

106
00:41:25,769 --> 00:41:49,732
I don't have a specific number, but I would like to defer to Assistant Superintendent David Murphy as well. I think he got muted. I would like to defer to him. He may have more of the specifics in terms of the total number of filters needed at the high school. Thank you. David. Thank you, Superintendent.

107
00:41:50,069 --> 00:42:14,977
I think that's a good point. that information because there was a variety of recommendations that were contained in WB's initial report. We've been using a number that exceeds a 100, it's either 116 or 119 based on our very

108
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:37,589
we're not going to be able to sort of clean or attaching ourselves too much to that specific number because a lot of this testing is going on. And as I said before, there is sort of an unusual sequence to this in that we're in a two-week window of testing and we're getting that data and hope to have all of it somewhere between

109
00:42:37,589 --> 00:43:05,382
that's why we commission this initial report. So we're using a number in the vicinity of 1, 10 to 1, 20, but that is without having fully digested or analyze the findings of WB or having access to the

110
00:43:05,382 --> 00:43:34,373
the number as stated in the memo, it's significant, and that's why we're using sort of a placeholder number of $200,000 with regard to infrastructure, internal to Medford High School. But I can't say that after we've had a chance to truly analyze both the report and the data, I can't say that we may modify that position. Now, John, I don't know if you want to add anything to that.

111
00:43:35,673 --> 00:43:56,632
Well, yeah, and we're going to meet again Thursday with the engineer. And we're going to probably try to get some high numbers of where we need additional support. So that's sort of where we stand right now. Yeah, I mean, the big thing for us is we want to make

112
00:43:57,205 --> 00:44:20,746
decisions as to how to use based on as much data as possible, understanding that we're obviously very much up against the clock. But based on our current implementation plan with regard to when students will be in the building, we have these coming weeks to try to utilize whatever mitigation strategies we think are necessary to have as much defense as possible.

113
00:44:21,877 --> 00:44:41,182
Okay, thank you. And then just one more question through the chair if I could. Does the assessment point to that these HEPA filters would then meet the needs or is there a chance we're going to put these HEPA filters in and it's tested again and we find that we have to go, you know, even farther as far as the HVAC and things like that?

114
00:44:41,300 --> 00:45:10,645
I think that's an excellent question. And exactly the questions that we're currently posing to the engineers that we're meeting with to make a determination as to, I think both exactly what is the impact now and what is the impact long term? Because right now there's sort of a heightened standard that industry experts are advising districts and other employers, frankly, to potentially utilize. And I think there's a question as to, once we spend the $200,000,

115
00:45:14,813 --> 00:45:35,907
the building, what exactly is the return on investment going forward? And obviously, we want the best air quality and best air exchange rates possible. And at the same time, as I said, today, we have no evidence that there's an actual problem with the building. But we're also operating in a context in which, again, people have very understanding of the

116
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:58,250
Okay, thank you. So really what I'm hearing is essentially it's just the nature of the beast because of the way these standards are coming down and just looking into the building this way, things are changing and sometimes it can be hard to nail down exact amounts because of that, but the intention is there as laid out in these papers and in the email we got, correct?

117
00:45:58,250 --> 00:46:23,140
And I think that's correct. And to the superintendent's point that she made earlier, we certainly recognize our responsibility to report back, obviously, to the Medford School Committee and also to the Medford City Council, as to exactly what strategies are being employed, what impact we foresee those strategies having, and what is the return on investment for the community, whether it be installing capital filters, repairing fans on the roof,

118
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:38,902
I think that's all I have to say. I think that's all I have to say.

119
00:46:39,340 --> 00:47:02,290
Thank you, Mr. President. I have a few. I know that the council has asked some great questions. Just to the superintendent, if I can, Mr. President, or Mr. Rodriguez. Legally, the money that was left in those accounts, it's okay to be used in this form. I know that sometimes when you get money in certain grants or

120
00:47:02,290 --> 00:47:29,881
You have to use specific reasons, I just want to reassure that they are being used for what's intended and we can still move forward with that. If we could have someone from the administration, I'm not sure if Dave or Superintendent Edward Vincent, if you could, let's see, Dave Rodriguez, Chief of Staff. Okay.

121
00:47:30,725 --> 00:47:43,313
this case.

122
00:47:43,837 --> 00:48:13,064
in order to just reauthorize it, essentially reauthorizing the use of the funds. The funds have already been borrowed, they're cash in hand, so we don't have to go out to bond for these proceeds. And we've actually been paying debt service on them since they were borrowed. So we've been sending you an account that we've been paying debt service on since they were borrowed, by reprogramming them so we're allowed to release those funds for that specific use, pursuant to the reauthorization. That's allowed under Chapter 44. I forget the exact section, but it's quoted within the council paper.

123
00:48:13,722 --> 00:48:34,462
Thank you. Mr. President, to the superintendent, I know probably one of the oldest schools is Curtis Tough School. Are we still planning on having a program running in a positive manner that it's always run? And how does that look with air quality testing? Is that one of the schools being looked at as we speak?

124
00:48:34,883 --> 00:48:48,232
Yes, so ironically enough, because the Curtis Tufts is actually the oldest building, they have very, very large windows that can open. And so one of the best

125
00:48:48,839 --> 00:49:15,063
based on what the engineers feedback that the engineers have given to us is to allow natural air to come into the spaces. So the Curtis Tufts has, you know, very tall ceilings, very large windows in every single classroom. So although we know we'll be waiting for what the reports say, we anticipate very good remarks, scores for the Curtis Tufts

126
00:49:15,063 --> 00:49:44,020
that they have the ability to let in a lot of natural air to support air quality at that facility. So we are waiting again for the final reports from the outside schools that are still ongoing. And again, if air filters or something like that is needed, we are prepared to put those in place at all of the buildings, including the Curtis House.

127
00:49:44,375 --> 00:50:14,125
Madam Superintendent, what neighbor communities and other schools are using across the country. Have we looked at using the viability of the gymnasium? We probably have one of the biggest gymnasiums in the state, and to use those as classrooms. I think that could be a viable way to move some of those classes that have some issues that can't be repaired. But is that something that we're investigating too?

128
00:50:15,644 --> 00:50:36,873
But we have not ruled out using alternative spaces within the high school complex in particular. The only fear is, you know, we have very, very long winters and it is important for students to be able, while the weather permitting, you know, they can go outside and use the outside fields.

129
00:50:36,873 --> 00:50:55,435
But that would be something that we would have to look at. But as a temporary measure, we would not rule out having to use other spaces, including the gymnasium. OK. And again, to the superintendent, through you, Mr. President,

130
00:50:56,245 --> 00:51:14,808
No one thought you're going to come into Medford, become the new superintendent, handle a pandemic and other issues and the concerns that we're seeing today in society. I know that with the race issues we have, I think that I've talked to some teachers and

131
00:51:14,808 --> 00:51:38,551
Already the staff in professional development, you've already started a dialogue that's talking about race and making sure that our teachers are prepared for our questions from our students. Because there are going to be a lot of questions, a lot of concerns, and I'm so happy to see that the team is moving forward.

132
00:51:39,091 --> 00:52:04,083
It brings me to the bigger point, I think that it was easy a few weeks ago to people in higher power to slam this council because they think that what was thought was that we were hurting the kids of the city of Medford. Now, as a father of two kids in that system, that's the furthest from my mind. So I wanted to applaud this council.

133
00:52:04,083 --> 00:52:23,101
Because this is our job, whether you like it or not, it's to look at every penny and making sure that we're using it for the right reasons. And look at the time we spent, it's almost been an hour, and we've been talking about, this is just scratching the surface, about what this money can be used for. And these questions,

134
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:45,460
If not used for the reasons to get our children back in the school for any reason, who would they hold accountable? That would be us, because we would have proved it. So I applaud this council for taking the extra time to make sure that we dotted our I's and crossed our T's to make sure we can get our students and faculty into a safe,

135
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:57,391
We've already heard that delaying it to two weeks didn't have any issues with moving that point forward. So again, I know that

136
00:52:58,910 --> 00:53:27,327
It's easy to beat people up, but we need to stay positive. And I think that with the steps you're taking and your team is taking, Superintendent, and Johnny McLaughlin, we're trying to do to get our kids back into a safe, healthy school. What this council's doing to make sure any funding we do have goes right to the proper locations, making sure that Alicia Nunley's working with that COVID fund, making sure that we're doing what's right.

137
00:53:27,327 --> 00:53:49,737
And I appreciate it, and I thank you. I do want to end just with one thing, some of the, that we have you, Madam Superintendent. The biggest question I'm hearing right now is, please, when will the kids know their schedule? I know they're scheduled to start next week. If you can answer that final question, just to give them an idea, I think it'll be very helpful. Thank you.

138
00:53:50,497 --> 00:54:13,278
We did send out the tentative schedule of what their instructional day will look like. We have not sent out at the secondary level, the high school level over the next few days. The student schedules will be sent out. School brings is converting over and with the assignments

139
00:54:13,278 --> 00:54:40,548
of teachers and working on the assignments of cohorts, all of that work is taking place right now. So under normal conditions, people would have had their schedules in advance, but due to all of the moving pieces that we are currently kind of working with right now, we were not able to create schedules. Had we sent schedules out, the schedules most likely would have ended up having to change.

140
00:54:40,548 --> 00:54:57,659
So it's a situation where we are measuring twice in order to cut once. And so I ask the entire community for a little more patience for us to be able to match up the students with the cohorts.

141
00:54:57,659 --> 00:55:12,458
With the days of the week, with the staffing that's available, with all of the adjustments that had to be made, we were not able to send out the schedule, but that will be completed over the next few days.

142
00:55:13,032 --> 00:55:39,880
So again, Madam Superintendent, I thank you. And again, I just urge the community to, it's easy to stand on that soapbox and pound your chest, but let's all have a sense of a community and understand that this is the first time for a lot of communities. And the community I'm working in right now, this is exactly the issues they're going through. And it's been a mess. So we're all working together.

143
00:55:40,623 --> 00:56:01,210
We're doing this together for the first time. Let's just stay positive and make sure that we do what's best for our community and our children. Thank you. Thank you, Councilor Scarapelli. Councilor Pierce. Thank you, Mr. President. And thank you, Dr. Vincent. I know you're working with a smaller staff than you were working with last year, I think including the data director, so I know it must be difficult.

144
00:56:01,818 --> 00:56:31,028
I spent four years in Medford High School this side of the year 2000, and I can tell you if it was bad before, it's worse now. So I really appreciate the condition that the building is in and the work that needs to happen. I have two quick questions, hopefully. The first one is, has any spending on HVAC repairs or other repairs to, or upgrades to make sure the building, Medford High School, is safe? Have those happened already? Has any spending occurred?

145
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:40,546
So John McLaughlin would have to speak specifically to the spending that may have occurred.

146
00:56:41,693 --> 00:57:05,470
outside of the reports not coming in yet. So we, again, as we're just getting this information kind of hot off the press, we were waiting for what the reports would reveal so that we could know which way to go. Because a lot of, there's a lot of vendors out there, a lot of people saying, do this, do that. But again, where the high school has its unique

147
00:57:05,470 --> 00:57:33,044
It's unique structure. We have classrooms without windows. There are a lot of special parts of the high school. You know, the science wing, which is completely renovated. So we have so many different parts of the building. I know that we had held off waiting for guidance so that we would be able to really make smart decisions. But John McLaughlin could speak to what may have already been spent.

148
00:57:35,204 --> 00:57:59,842
John McLaughlin. Yeah, so the money that you appropriated about a year ago, you appropriated, I think it was $325,000. We're going to look into doing bathrooms, a generator, repairs to the PA system, and a few other projects. So currently, the bathroom project

149
00:57:59,842 --> 00:58:20,547
We had to get an architect in, so I'm awaiting the architect's plans so that we can go through the procurement process and move forward with that. The generator, I'm actually waiting for a price as well to repair that generator or to replace that generator that we had talked about about a year ago.

150
00:58:20,547 --> 00:58:46,028
Things are moving slowly. People aren't out and about and around as much as they usually are. But we are. We're still working forward. We're also working with CPA grants to put in new soft surfaces and repair all the equipment, outside playground equipment at the Columbus, in the Brooks, as well as a study that we'll be conducting hopefully shortly about ADA compliance.

151
00:58:46,028 --> 00:59:01,250
for the soft surface at the McGlynn area or maybe a redesign for the soft surface play area at the McGlynn. So those projects have been moving forward with them. But as you can imagine,

152
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:18,108
with everything going on it's not as it's not as easy to get the people you know to to come to come into the building and you know the exposure and things of that nature but yeah we're still moving forward and um you know and and and and if you if if you're gracious enough to

153
00:59:18,108 --> 00:59:35,675
this money. We're going to do some good things with it. And it's going to be a win-win for the kids in the community. And yeah, we're going to have to really, really work hard to maintain what we have. I mean, we have over a million square feet in the district.

154
00:59:35,675 --> 01:00:00,751
And, you know, there's a lot of moving parts, so we're constantly moving around through the city fixing things that break and as they break. And sometimes we find ourselves running around just putting out little fires and not necessarily doing, you know, some of the other maintenance issues go by the wayside. And unfortunately,

155
01:00:00,751 --> 01:00:18,655
Sometimes this is what happens in programs that we want to put computers in kids' hands and run programs. So sometimes building as old as Method High School paid the price, and we're paying for the sins.

156
01:00:18,655 --> 01:00:36,897
that have been going on since the 70s now. So it's not anybody in particular's fault. It's not somebody's fault because we're doing the best we can. We're trying as hard as we can. Now, every roof fan at Method High School isn't bad.

157
01:00:37,758 --> 01:01:04,420
To take the time to diagnose the roof fans, it's easier to replace them all and start off with brand new roof fans. So I don't want you to think that it's all bad. It's just that what we're trying to do is make improvements to the whole roof situation and exhaust fans. I hope that answers your question.

158
01:01:05,298 --> 01:01:32,635
Thank you, John. Yeah, I appreciate the answer, and I understand the concern of vendors coming into the building. My only other question, well, also I like Dr. Vinson saying that there are special parts of the building. I thought that was kind, kind language. My other question is just the timeline. Do you think that these repairs will be completed by the current estimated date where students might be coming back into the building, which I think is mid-October, or would they go past that?

159
01:01:34,053 --> 01:01:52,649
So again, because we don't have all of the reports, we know right now that the high school needs significant work and over the next week, by the end of next week, we should have reports regarding the other schools. So again, if it's really,

160
01:01:52,649 --> 01:02:18,974
small mitigation that's required in the outside buildings where we, you know, as it is, we're working around the clock, but we will continue to get it done. We want kids back in school as quickly as possible, but we need to ensure that the buildings are safe and meet the appropriate standards. And so we are trying to do it as quickly as possible. We're not taking shortcuts because we do know that this is,

161
01:02:18,974 --> 01:02:43,409
everyone's safety and health at risk. So we want it to be done as quickly as possible, but we need it to be done correctly. So as soon as we have the data from the outside engineering reports, we will, you know, go into high gear action to mitigate, you know, and meet whatever it is that they're recommending for us to get our buildings back online as soon as possible.

162
01:02:43,409 --> 01:03:03,693
So my hope would definitely be that by October, we would be up and running at all, if not the majority of our buildings. Thank you, Dr. Vincent, and I appreciate the due diligence and the documentation sent over today and look forward to further documentation. I would move approval of both papers.

163
01:03:04,587 --> 01:03:23,352
Thank you, Councilor Behrs. Vice President Carviello. Thank you, Mr. President. To the chair, to the superintendent, before we install all these HEPA filters in the buildings, is all the ductwork going to be cleaned, the current ductwork going to be cleaned and disinfected?

164
01:03:25,917 --> 01:03:54,841
So, I mean, based on what the engineering reports will show to us, I believe as everything's being worked on that everything will be cleaned or made to the appropriate standard, you know, possible because filters need to be added and there are a lot of other recommendations. So in just the natural course of getting the systems up and running, that would need to happen.

165
01:03:56,309 --> 01:04:10,417
Well, I mean, I don't want to be putting brand new filters on ductwork that hasn't been cleaned and disaffected. So I think that was the question that I asked. So is that going to happen before we do this?

166
01:04:12,425 --> 01:04:33,248
I can't speak to the steps in which, or the order in which it's going to happen. I do know that we do need filters. I don't know how the ducts would be sanitized per se, but I would believe that they're going to be putting filters onto the HVAC systems.

167
01:04:33,248 --> 01:04:58,375
that they would definitely have to clean it before you put, you know, even when you get your air conditioning serviced at home, they clean it and they put in new filters. So I can't speak to the exact steps because, you know, I'm not, you know, an engineer that can address the, you know, appropriate steps, but I would definitely say that yes, they would have to clean it. You wouldn't want to,

168
01:04:58,814 --> 01:05:25,527
you know, once you take out an old filter and you put in a new filter, that they would appropriately clean it before they added the next filter in. Again, I can't, you know, I'm not an HVAC expert, but I, you know, could not see them not taking the appropriate steps to get our system fully functioning based on what the reports are saying to us.

169
01:05:25,730 --> 01:05:49,507
I would ask that you make that part of your report to them that these vents be cleaned and disinfected before they come back online. No, no, we can definitely do that. That can definitely be part of, once we get to the actual piece to say make sure all

170
01:05:51,312 --> 01:06:00,053
and sanitized and before you add the new filters to it. Thank you Madam Superintendent.

171
01:06:03,496 --> 01:06:33,348
Thank you, Mr. President. I was wondering if we, I asked the question earlier, I'm not sure if I got an answer. If the school administration knows how much, or maybe Mr. Rodriguez, how much money is available in the CARES Act and also the COVID funds for safety purposes within our public schools? Would someone like to, would David Murphy or David Rodriguez or Superintendent Edward Vincent have the answer to that?

172
01:06:34,968 --> 01:06:41,903
I think Mr. Rodriguez might be able to speak specifically to that.

173
01:06:42,595 --> 01:07:10,220
to the council as soon as possible. It was an allocation of $225 per student. directly for mitigation efforts.

174
01:07:10,507 --> 01:07:40,105
And Mr. President, I have a question for the superintendent of schools regarding what is the current school policy on the rental of our buildings? So for buildings that are being rented, they have to go and be approved through the Board of Health, first and foremost. So at the high school, we do have one of the churches using the high school

175
01:07:40,105 --> 01:08:07,628
care and theater, the little theater. And in order for that space to be used, it has to be used at a reduced capacity, which is following the governor's guidance. And in addition to that, the renters had to submit what their COVID-19 protocols would be to the board of health. And so they had to put specific things in place. The custodian sanitized,

176
01:08:07,865 --> 01:08:37,767
and clean the spaces before and afterwards. They have one door that's used for an entrance, a separate door that's used for an exit way. So there are safety protocols that are put in place so that traffic, people are not crossing each other and they are maintaining social distancing. They are wearing their masks. So they have to, before anything is approved, it has to, that plan has to be approved through the Board of Health.

177
01:08:37,767 --> 01:09:06,877
And that's what the renters are doing. They are meeting the standards that have been set for them. And we as a district, we are sanitizing and cleaning those spaces appropriately. So Madam Superintendent, I am astonished. We're talking about safety and health of our students, our faculty, our teachers, staff within our schools. Why we would introduce

178
01:09:07,501 --> 01:09:28,747
hundreds of people that wouldn't necessarily be in our buildings into our buildings through the rental of our buildings. So it's not hundreds of people because the county theater has a capacity of maybe 400. And at any given time, it's probably filled at a quarter capacity.

179
01:09:28,747 --> 01:09:57,029
so it is not hundreds of people that are in the building. I also want to state that I have been in the building every single day, along with the custodians, along with the secretaries, along with all of the staff that are physically reporting to work at the high school complex every day, and the building is being cleaned and sanitized. And as a normal citizen, I go to stop and shop, I go to CVS, I practice,

180
01:09:57,029 --> 01:10:27,016
proper hygiene in terms of hand-washing, wearing a mask, using hand sanitizer, because we cannot allow the virus to stop us from living and from doing our daily living activities. And if there is fear that any part of the school is going to be rented, then that fear is also going to carry over to students being allowed to come into the building. So we need to be able to...

181
01:10:27,961 --> 01:10:49,578
Thank you, Mr. President, and I was just trying to finish my thought, and I appreciate the superintendent's response. However, Mr. President, when I say hundreds, I said hundreds, and it's really thousands because it's not the one Saturday or Sunday they're in our building. It's over a course of time. So to sit back and say it's only a couple of hundred,

182
01:10:49,578 --> 01:11:13,000
That may be true for one given weekend, Mr. President, or two, but not over the course of the year. It's thousands of people being introduced into our schools. And why subject students, staff, Mr. President, to the additional people coming into the building? And I understand and appreciate there's protocols and procedures, and they have to get signed off from the Board of Health.

183
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:40,405
And I can appreciate that, Mr. President. But in my opinion, when you have people from outside that are coming into the buildings, you're not sure what precautions they may be taking. They may sign a paper, Mr. President, but when they're in that building, what type of supervision is there? What type of protocols are being put in place to make sure, Mr. President, that our kids, our staff, our teachers are being safe when they enter the building the next day?

184
01:11:41,232 --> 01:12:10,578
Why risk it, Mr. President? They're using our buildings, Mr. President. They're using classrooms. They're using cafeterias. They're using gymnasiums. They're using restrooms. They're using auditoriums. Now, you're telling me, Mr. President, that our staff, who are very capable at the high school, are going to make sure that every inch of the high school or the McGlynn School or any other school is sanitized, every inch of the building.

185
01:12:11,573 --> 01:12:41,560
I have a tough time believing that, Mr. President. In the interest of safety that we're talking about and health, I would respectfully ask that the school committee look back at their policy and stop the policy of renting the buildings, Mr. President, until we're able to get this situation under hand. I realize it's a revenue source for the schools. I understand that, Mr. President, that we count on. But safety should come first.

186
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:50,285
I've heard from a number of parents, a number of faculty members that are concerned about going back into the buildings because of the rentals.

187
01:12:50,774 --> 01:13:14,585
So I would respectfully ask the superintendent and the school committee, along with the administration, revisit the policy on renting the buildings, Mr. President, until we can get a better handle on our children going back. The issues that we're going to be confronting, not only with the rentals, Mr. President, but just going back to school in general under a COVID new society.

188
01:13:14,585 --> 01:13:40,370
Why compound it with the rentals of the building? It makes zero sense to me. And no one's going to tell me otherwise, Mr. President. Thank you. Thank you, Councilor Marks. Councilor Peers. Thank you, Mr. President. I just think the same logic could be applied to having council meetings and other board and committee meetings at City Hall and City Hall staff. Thank you. Thank you, Councilor Peers. If I may, John McLaughlin, if you're still with us.

189
01:13:52,942 --> 01:14:21,713
John McLaughlin. I'm trying to unmute John. John. Oh, sorry. Hold on one second. I've got to get my earplugs. No worries. My daughter's over with a bunch of her friends, so they wanted to get the fire going. I apologize. No worries.

190
01:14:25,915 --> 01:14:30,944
Just let me know when you're ready and I'll...

191
01:14:54,468 --> 01:15:23,324
John, you can start. I'm on. OK, thank you. So a couple of questions. So with regard to the roof fans, as a past graduate of Medford High School, are you familiar with the complex? Mr. President, could you say that again? As a graduate of Medford High School, I'm very familiar with the complex. So are we replacing all of the roof fans?

192
01:15:24,067 --> 01:15:39,389
Yeah, we were intended on replacing them all, yes. We weren't going to get into diagnostics because we figured it would be more of an expense and it would be easier if we just went up there and replaced them all.

193
01:15:39,608 --> 01:16:09,595
So when you replace the fans, are you cutting into the roof? Or how does that work? I don't mean to get into that. No, no, no. You unhook the fan that's currently there and replace it with another one. No, you would not be cutting on the roof. OK. I was just curious as far as I know, like when I was in the school committee, and we always had roof issues. So I just didn't want to solve one problem but create another. So that's what my question was going there. Nope. It wouldn't do that at all. It's just replacing existing motors.

194
01:16:09,832 --> 01:16:16,463
in hoods that are up there currently. Okay, thank you very much. Are there any other questions from the council?

195
01:16:16,666 --> 01:16:41,388
Mr. President, I would respectfully ask if the superintendent, I know she was trying to answer my questions and comments, if she can finish with her statement. Yes, Superintendent Ron Vinson, I'm sorry I didn't cut you off, but Councilor Marks had the floor, so if you could please continue with your comments, I'd greatly appreciate it.

196
01:16:42,991 --> 01:17:07,105
And so essentially the comments that I was making were in regards to the rentals. And I think Councilor Beers made the equally valid point of saying that the chambers and City Hall are also used for other events. I do feel that we need to get students back into school. We need to use good judgment.

197
01:17:07,105 --> 01:17:36,637
When our buildings are rented, we have security on hand. We have our custodians who get to work on the weekends and get overtime. So we have custodians who are ready, willing to clean and sanitize and follow the COVID procedures that we have in place. And yes, if we're renting a space, people do need to use the facilities from time to time. So the bathrooms will be cleaned and sanitized as well.

198
01:17:36,637 --> 01:18:06,337
The school committee did vote that we can rent our building spaces and work with some of the partners that we've had for a long time, provided they meet the standards that the Board of Health has put before them. And so all of those that are using any of our buildings, they've met those standards, and that's why they've been able to use this space. Those are my final remarks.

199
01:18:08,092 --> 01:18:37,420
Any other questions from the council? Mr. President, I just want to go on record that I disagree 100% with the rental of our buildings during this particular phase of COVID-19 based on the health and safety of our students, our faculties, our administrators, our teachers, and everyone else within our buildings, Mr. President. Thank you, Councilor Marks. Is the Board of Health Director on the call? Is she still here?

200
01:18:38,112 --> 01:19:02,969
I don't think so, but I could be wrong. While you're looking, I think it's very important that Councilman Marks brings up a good point. The difference between having meetings here, this is our job. This is open for the community to get things done, whether it's voting, whether it's councils, city school committee meetings.

201
01:19:03,205 --> 01:19:26,712
What Council Marks, I believe, is bringing up is an option. We have options whether to keep those schools closed and making sure that we're taking our precautions to the total responsibility that we have to make sure they're safe and clean. The difference of having people in this building, this is where we do the people's work.

202
01:19:27,674 --> 01:19:54,185
Not to rent for a outside church group that's not even from Medford, or whether it's from Medford or not, or whether it's an athletic program or a dance or whatnot. These are things that, what I'd like to ask the health director, and I'll do that via email if she's not on, is I'd like the protocol that she used to allow 400 people to enter our schools.

203
01:19:54,758 --> 01:20:21,539
But then limit this body to close the doors for the people that want to come to a podium. So everybody here in this room, everybody in this room, they've been putting themselves out there. They're shopping in supermarkets. They're handing out ballots. They're coming to these meetings. So we know.

204
01:20:22,957 --> 01:20:44,776
That if that's the case, this building should be open. So this is going to be interesting to see what our Board of Health Director is going to answer these questions, because I, too, agree with Councilor Mox. The job that's done in this room is the business. The job that's going outside in those schools right now, that's for profit. And I don't think that's the equivalent for safety. I just don't.

205
01:20:45,164 --> 01:21:13,700
Thank you. Thank you, Councilor Scott. Kelly, Councilor Morrell. Thank you, Mr. President. Yeah, I don't really think this is the appropriate forum to debate signs at this point. I move approval of both papers. Second. Councilor Nonson, what's the motion? I move approval of both papers. And I second. Thank you. I think, Clerk Cardavis, did you mention that there was someone wanted to comment on this? Mr. President, Sean Beaman from 362 Lawrence Road.

206
01:21:14,054 --> 01:21:44,024
the city has the following question. Has anyone asked the teachers union whether, if this contemplated HVAC work is completed at the high school, will the teachers return to the building? Has the union made that commitment? I think what I would say in response is that the work that we're undertaking to ensure that our infrastructure

207
01:21:46,117 --> 01:22:09,353
or exceeds the safety standards being set by public health officials has been a significant part of the dialogue, ongoing dialogue that we have with all of our collective bargaining partners. I didn't want to speak for them and certainly wouldn't want to make any representations as to what they have communicated in the course of those negotiations, but I would say that we

208
01:22:12,037 --> 01:22:37,282
studies and the analysis that is part of what we've been talking about here tonight. The various engineering firms that we've retained have been an important part of the conversations that we're having with our bargaining partners. And I think that the one point that we've made throughout the course of our discussions with teachers and the other unions is that we recognize that the advocacy for

209
01:22:41,095 --> 01:23:10,795
on behalf of safety, certainly recognize the importance of getting students into school and continuing their education process as early as possible. And those advocating for people for having in-person learning recognize that safety is a basic entitlement that everyone who enters the school should expect. So I think that we're trying to keep that dialogue as constructive as possible and recognizing the value from what may seem like inflicting points of view is something that's always important to remember.

210
01:23:11,875 --> 01:23:40,529
Mr. President. Thank you. Counselor Scott Kelly. If I can, I did have discussions with the union president, and I think they're waiting for the word on the air quality test as well. So I think everybody's on the same page, but I believe they haven't heard back from the administration about any of the results, and I think we're still waiting for those. So I think that once that's done, I think we'll have a better understanding what the teachers union

211
01:23:40,529 --> 01:24:01,927
And I think that for the discussions I've had with different teachers, if they get those assurances, I'm sure they want to get back to school too. So I've talked to many of them and they want to get back to the classroom. So thank you. Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli. Councilor Night. Mr. President, thank you very much. I don't have much to say about the paper, but I did want to

212
01:24:01,927 --> 01:24:29,365
Welcome aboard, Assistant Superintendent Murphy, and thank him for going through his initiation this evening as his first appearance before the Memphis City Council. I do look forward to meeting him in a less formal setting, and I wish him all the best in his new endeavor. Thank you, I appreciate that. I look forward to coming back and reporting to your honorable body as to how we are being good fiscal stewards of the community's taxpayer dollars. On the motion, Mr. President. Thank you. On the motion of.

213
01:24:29,990 --> 01:24:43,760
Councilor Morrell. Vice President Caviello, seconded by Councilor Behrs, as amended by Councilor Knight. Clerk Harnaby, please call the roll. Council Behrs. If I may, one minute.

214
01:24:44,570 --> 01:25:06,153
Mr. Clerk, Councilor Marks. This vote includes that the school administration will provide us with a list of priorities and recommendations as soon as we get them from engineering reports, correct? What's the amendment? Can you please read the amendment?

215
01:25:06,153 --> 01:25:35,178
Council night's amendment was to use the farm. It was to allow the schools to use the funds across the school district, not just at the high school. Okay, was that the only amendment? That is the only thing. Vice President Carabiello asked for a list of improvements to be made, but he didn't offer in the form of an amendment. I will second it. Okay, let's see. So if we could make that in the form of an amendment, please.

216
01:25:35,414 --> 01:26:04,456
That would be fine. That's similar to the superintendent stating that she would honor that amendment. So I would vote that. I didn't get that last amendment from Council Mars. Let's see. The last amendment was from, I believe, Vice President Caviello. OK. So Vice President Caviello's request for a list was an amendment, OK? OK. Do you have that? I have it, yes. OK, perfect. So on the motion of?

217
01:26:04,945 --> 01:26:32,620
Vice President Caviello, seconded by Councilor Behrs as amended by Councilors Knight and Councilors Marks. Clerk Artemis, please call the roll. Was it Councilor Marks or Vice President Caviello who just made the last amendment? They were co-sponsors of the amendment and I moved to second them all. Vice President Caviello. Thank you. Councilor Behrs? Yes. Vice President Caviello? Yes. Councilor Knight? Yes. Councilor Marks? Yes. Councilor Morrell?

218
01:26:36,586 --> 01:27:06,438
Councilor Morrell? Yes. Councilor Scarpelli? Yes. I'm starting here, Councilor Scarpelli. Yes. Yes? He said yes. Thank you. President Fevella? Yes. Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative. The motion passes. We're under suspension, Mr. President. Paper 20517, the companion paper to the paper that was just on the table. Move for approval. Second. That would be 20516.

219
01:27:07,147 --> 01:27:29,135
So we took seven first? We took seven first. Yeah. Well, let's give them the big money now. Still second. I gotta read it really quick. 20-516 to the honorable president and members of the Memphis City Council, City Hall, Memphis, Massachusetts, 02155, dear Mr. President and city councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body reprogram surplus proceeds in the amount of $700,000

220
01:27:29,135 --> 01:27:54,565
$703,489.80 from the Medford High School Science Labs Project to the Medford High School School Improvements Project in accordance with Mass General Law Chapter 44, Section 20. Finance Director Alicia Nunley-Benjamin is present to answer any of the council's questions regarding this matter. On the motion of council tonight-

221
01:27:54,953 --> 01:28:21,059
Can we amend this to also allow these funds to be used for other schools, as we did for the last paper? There's no amendments on this. If someone wants to make amendments- I would second that motion. Mr. President, why don't we transfer all the amendments from the past paper to this paper? On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Beers to transfer all of the amendments from the first paper to the second paper. Clerk Urtubis, please call the roll. I second.

222
01:28:26,543 --> 01:28:54,050
Yes. Yes. Yes.

Councilor Knight?

232
01:32:46,840 --> 01:33:03,648
Mr. President, thank you very much. I think this is a rather self-explanatory resolution. However, the reason that it's being filed is not so self-explanatory. Here in our community now, I've never served on the council at a time where I've gotten more calls.

233
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:23,628
about permits being delayed, demolition delays, and the like, Mr. President. And I'd like to take a review of the annual reports as required by the Historical Commission to be filed with the administration to take a look at what's going on. My brief research on this topic has shown me, Mr. President, that since 2009,

234
01:33:23,628 --> 01:33:37,415
There have been over 50 plus cases where demolition delay has been implemented in the community, but only four homes have not been demolished during this time. Four buildings, I should say, not even homes, buildings. Four buildings have not been demolished.

235
01:33:37,702 --> 01:34:03,706
the success rate is minimal, is minimal at this point in time. So I have a number of questions like, have these four homes been restored or did they just not get demolished? Were they restored to a historic state or were they left there to just be the same way that they were before they were deemed to be historically significant or preferentially preserved? Do these 50 plus cases include applicants who are delayed and withdrew their appeal?

236
01:34:03,706 --> 01:34:33,693
the 18 month or the six month period was up at the time, Mr. President. I'm getting a lot of pushback and a lot of phone calls about people who feel as though the demolition delay is being used as a weapon against them for not complying with certain requirements and certain things that are being demanded of them. And it's starting to become very problematic, Mr. President. And the reason I say it's problematic is because when we look at what's going on in this community right now, when we look at our financial situation here in this community,

237
01:34:33,693 --> 01:35:03,005
If we don't embrace development in the very near future, I'm going to say we don't have the ability to meet our payroll next year. For the past five years, we've generated at least $1.5 million in new growth in this community. And that $1.5 million is necessary for us to just meet the contractual obligations of our payroll. This fiscal year, we've estimated our new growth to be at $1 million, not $1.5 million as it has been for the past five years.

238
01:35:04,253 --> 01:35:28,233
This coupled with the fact that we have certain sectors of our economy that we need to bring back, like the restaurant industry and the hotel industry. Because those sectors allow us to raise additional revenues here for the community, Mr. President. So I think we've done a great job in expanding the offerings that we have for outdoor dining in the community. And we need to do that because the meals tax is a benefit.

239
01:35:28,334 --> 01:35:58,068
that we get when our restaurants do well. And the same goes for our hotels. If hotels are being turned over, we get a tax on that, Mr. President. And right now, with one in five adults out of work, 20% unemployment across the commonwealth, I think it's important for us to look down the line a little bit at what the financial situation is going to be in this community. And unless we start embracing development, generating permitting fees and new growth, we're not going to be

240
01:35:58,068 --> 01:36:14,453
in a strong financial position come this time next year. And a lot of this, I think, surrounds some of the work that's being done relative to demolition delay. And now the next layer of that, which is going to be if you want a permit for basic

241
01:36:14,707 --> 01:36:38,399
repairs or modifications to your home, you're also going to have to go before that other layer of bureaucracy and potentially be subject to an 18 month delay in the issuance of your permit. And I think that's a problem, Mr. President. So I raise this issue because we've asked for a committee of the whole on this months and months ago. It hasn't happened. We've asked for reports. We haven't gotten them. We haven't gotten them.

242
01:36:38,534 --> 01:36:54,127
So here I am looking at this saying, what can we do in this community to help dig us out of this economic crisis? Well, one of those things we can do is develop wisely. Another thing we can do is generate permitting fees through development that's going to bolster.

243
01:36:55,460 --> 01:37:15,946
When we sat down and we talked about the budget, the biggest thing we talked about was the $2.4 million deficit in forecasted permitting fees out of the building department. And how are we going to climb out of this hole? Well, I can tell you by making people who want to invest in our community jump through hoops for 18 months.

244
01:37:16,942 --> 01:37:40,347
That's not going to do anything to jumpstart our economics, that's not going to do anything to generate more permitting fees, and that's not going to do anything to put us in a better economic and financial situation here in the community. Preserving historic homes is important, but I think we're going a bit too far at this point now, Mr. President. I think we're going a bit too far, and I think we really need to look at it, because quite frankly,

245
01:37:40,347 --> 01:38:08,917
If you have someone that wants to do a development in this community and they're subject to the demolition delay, the next thing that happens is the historical commission presents itself as a design review board. That says, well, show us your designs and if we like them, then we'll let you move forward. But nothing's to say that the designs that they show the historic commission are going to be approved by the ZBA. So we have a situation where we have someone that's looking to invest money in this community.

246
01:38:09,946 --> 01:38:39,460
who could be held up for 18 months at historic and then have to go through the whole process of the ZBA where they may or may not ever, ever get an approval for any design that they're seeking to implement in this community if variance is needed. I just think that it's very unfair, Mr. President, and rule number one in government for me has always been do no harm. Do no harm, rule number one in government. We had to help people, not hurt people. And when someone comes into the community and buys a parcel and wants to knock it down,

247
01:38:39,747 --> 01:38:52,471
And when they buy the parcel, the home's just a junky home. And when they want to knock it down, it becomes historically significant. And they've invested $750,000, $600,000, their life savings into these parcels.

248
01:38:52,825 --> 01:39:14,240
It's a life changing decision that's being made by a board or a commission that can harm these individuals. And I think it's very important, Mr. President, that we revisit the criteria, the circumstances, and the processes that we have in place when it comes down to the demolition delay or portions thereof. We spoke about it several weeks ago.

249
01:39:14,240 --> 01:39:34,658
And we called for a need for a committee of the whole on this. And I ask that it be scheduled sooner rather than later. And the reason I ask is because people are being hurt. People are being hurt financially in their pocket. When one in five adults in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts are unemployed and people are coming to Medford looking to invest money.

250
01:39:35,519 --> 01:39:57,203
I think we should embrace them and work with them, not against them, Mr. President. So with that being said, I ask for these reports to be issued and furnished to the council so that I can review them further and prepare myself for a committee of the whole, which is going to be scheduled. I have faith and confidence that it's going to get done, Mr. President. I know we're working under very strange circumstances these days. I feel like I'm at the zoo right now.

251
01:39:57,203 --> 01:40:20,947
Zoo, circus, the case could be made for either. But with that being said, Mr. President, I ask my council colleagues to support this resolution to get this information so that when we do have this further discussion and this further dialogue, we're all well informed as to what goes on, what the process is, and what the pros and cons of our ordinance is right now and how it affects people. So with that being said, I ask my council colleagues to support the resolution.

252
01:40:21,453 --> 01:40:50,326
Thank you, Council Knight. And Jeff, I may add really quick, that Committee of the Whole will be scheduled soon, as will, I'm working on the scheduling now for that, for rodents and for our big zoning meeting. So I can assure you that will be coming soon. Both equally important issues, Mr. President. Absolutely, so they're all on the agenda and they'll all be coming up soon. So thank you, Council Knight. And let's see, we have Councilor, Vice President Caviello.

253
01:40:50,326 --> 01:41:07,808
Thank you, Mr. President. Councilman Knox, I'm sorry, Councilman Nutt is 100% right. We'll make it through this year with what we have, but next year is going to be a very trying year for us. Monies that we've normally had in the past aren't going to be coming in.

254
01:41:08,382 --> 01:41:30,235
restaurants, sales, all these little things. And your building department generates millions of dollars in building permits for the city. Like it or not, development is a necessary part of the growth of a community, no matter what kind. And here we are.

255
01:41:30,235 --> 01:41:58,653
We're stunting growth in this community, even on these small projects. So again, I support Councilor Knight on this, and I'll second the motion from this. But again, we have to look for ways to generate money for this community, and we can't be chasing people away from this community. So we need to start embracing some things. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Vice President Cabrera. Point of information, Councilor Knight.

256
01:41:58,889 --> 01:42:22,126
And I'm not talking about developers, Mr. President, like Locust Street or like Moderna or Mill Creek. I'm talking about the local builder. I'm talking about someone that wants to come in and make an investment in the community, someone that's going to maybe renovate a home. Maybe come in and do an addition to a house. Maybe someone that's going to come in and knock down a parcel that's

257
01:42:22,463 --> 01:42:43,085
a single family home in an apartment two district and create a tax base for us with an apartment there that complies with the existing zoning. That's what I'm talking about, Mr. President. I'm not talking about these big wig developers that are coming in here from Boston that are just going to throw millions and millions of dollars away. I'm talking about builders that have a very small margin.

258
01:42:43,085 --> 01:43:09,258
And if they're tied up for eight, nine, or ten months and it costs them $80,000 to $100,000, they have a very difficult time surviving. And when you look at these small builders, you also have to understand that they probably employ between 50 and 60 people. 50 and 60 people that are going to be doing a job in this community, that are going to have the opportunity to spend their money in our local business districts for lunch.

259
01:43:10,355 --> 01:43:30,740
in our gas stations to gas up their cars, in our local hardware stores to pick up supplies. So it all goes to the circular flow of our economy, Mr. President. But I think it's very important that we look at this, and I know that we have a number of items on the agenda, and I don't want to go any longer than I already have. So thank you very much. Thank you, Councilor Knight. Councilor Morrell.

260
01:43:31,803 --> 01:43:54,010
you. Thank you, Mister President. Yeah, I want just to address one point. I know there are a number of things that were maybe misrepresented in that in those talking points that were actually addressed in this large packet. We got this this week, but I do just want to point out the fact that to your own calculations to counsel night's own calculations that over 11

261
01:43:54,010 --> 01:44:22,225
50 homes over 11 years, that's about five homes a year. I just want to address the scare tactics being used in that. I don't think that's exactly millions of dollars that have been lost because of a demo delay at five homes a year. Thank you. Thank you, Councilor Orell. Point of information, Councilor Knight. Not a scare tactic, a fact. There were 50 plus homes that have gone through the demolition delay and only four were saved. That's not a scare tactic. That's the truth. That's the facts that were included in the packet that were given to us by the

262
01:44:22,732 --> 01:44:50,339
Medford Historic District Commission. And it came in the packet this evening, even though we've asked for it, I can't tell you how many months ago. And the packet that it came in this evening is unrelated to the council request that came back previously. Not a scare tactic, Mr. President, just a fact. Thank you, Councilman. Any other questions or comments from the council? Yeah, I've had my hand up since we started, so just FYI.

263
01:44:51,368 --> 01:45:19,988
Yeah, I mean, a few things here. So one, I don't disagree that bringing in revenue is important. I think it's a little dangerous to be making land use and development decisions primarily on how they affect city revenue, although I do agree it's an important decision. I think more importantly, though, is the larger question of process. Last week, I helped a family work through the we've had this thing where now the building department is correctly

264
01:45:19,988 --> 01:45:40,576
going through and making sure that the Historical Commission has at least seen permits when they go out and they've built a new online system to do just that. I helped a family last week who was having an issue with the delay and quite frankly the delay isn't from the Historical Commission. The issue has been in the building department. A permit was issued and then the building department said,

265
01:45:40,576 --> 01:46:01,417
hold on a minute, we need to check. And then five days later, I made a couple calls, the building department sent it over to the historical commission, and that day, the historical commission brought it back. So these permits are sitting for days in the building department. The historical commission, when they get them, is turning them out the same day, if possible, and most of the time. So, you know, I just think we need to allow

266
01:46:01,417 --> 01:46:28,602
or encourage the building department to accelerate the work, make sure they have the resources they need, as is well taken the amount of permits that are happening, make sure they have the resources to process them and get them over. I don't think the blockage here is the historical commission. And quite frankly, if you've driven down West Street, you can see the travesty that's happened on West Street, where a historical home has been turned into a monstrosity, and there's no new units.

267
01:46:28,602 --> 01:46:49,207
It's still a single family home. It's just giant and takes up the lot now. So, you know, it's due diligence. I don't think the historical commission is the problem here. So if we can accelerate this process in the building department, get everything over, I think we'll be just fine. And maybe we can avoid some of this stuff like what's happening over on West Street. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Councilor. One minute, Councilor.

268
01:46:51,046 --> 01:47:20,493
Councilor Knight. I certainly support the councilor's position to accelerate the process. Maybe that's why we need to look at whether or not an 18-month delay is appropriate or whether it should be reverted back to six. Thank you, Councilor Knight. Mr. President. We have Councilor Morrell, and then we'll Councilor Morrell. Yeah, Mr. President, if I could just draw attention to rule number 17 of the council, just upon debatable merits, a councilor shall speak no more than three times or more than 15 minutes on a single issue. I think that's something that gets railroaded on this council often, and I just want to highlight that. Thank you.

269
01:47:20,797 --> 01:47:48,860
She'll make a motion for the chair to make a ruling. Thank you, Council Member. Councilor Pierce. Thank you, Mr. President. Yeah, I don't think the issue here is the length of the demo delay. There's hundreds, if not thousands, of permits issued in this city. There's 50 over 10 years that have been subject to demo delay, and four have not been demoed, which, in my opinion, is a net benefit to the city. But again, I think the issue is making sure the building department has the resources to make sure this process moves well. I think people are doing good work.

270
01:47:49,687 --> 01:48:15,522
the assertion that the historical commission's functioning as a design review board is really reflective of the work they're doing. They're taking a quick look. And 99% of the time, everything is moving through the process. And I think, you know, if we can get resources to the building department to make sure that process moves quickly, that's something we should do. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Councilman Piers. Let's see, we have Thompson, are you all set? I am, Mr. President. Just a request for information.

271
01:48:15,809 --> 01:48:33,038
Thank you, Councilman Knight. Okay, we have enough people that want to speak on this. Cheryl R., let's see, I'm going to try to unmute you. Cheryl, may I ask you to name and address for the record, please?

272
01:48:34,270 --> 01:49:04,240
I'm Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street. I just want to clarify that the goal of the demo delay is not necessarily to stop demolition, so it's not failing. The length was increased to 18 months because we had a particular developer in the city who was refusing to engage with the historic mission because the time was short enough that it was profitable enough for him to just ignore them and wait it out. The 18-month period is rarely, if ever, used to its entirety, but it is an encouragement for the

273
01:49:04,240 --> 01:49:23,579
to be redirected to rezoning.

274
01:49:23,579 --> 01:49:45,145
waiting to be further blighted to increase their odds of gaining variances in the future. Perhaps you could focus on having some fees to prevent these types of developers from leaving these parcels intentionally empty to increase their profit margins in the future. This could immediately add money to the city of Medford coppers to be used in the way that Mr. Knight would like to have them.

275
01:49:45,145 --> 01:50:07,589
The sale for flippers is misguided. It's being quickly used to price out residents. These homes that are being purchased are not all in knock-down condition. They are being purchased by flippers because the parcels the homes sit on are large enough for them to squeeze in an additional home on the property. So they're being purchased for spec rather than to be used by end residents.

276
01:50:07,589 --> 01:50:23,266
This is not about the home condition. Every flip increases the assessments in those neighborhoods, which are increasing the cost for all of those who live around them. I welcome you to also embrace looking at assessments across the city, because there are some neighborhoods

277
01:50:23,266 --> 01:50:51,329
that are being, seeing their assessment jump by leaps and bounds, but despite the fact that our homes are not increasing in value at these rates, but are being increased based on the comps from the flips, there are neighborhoods that are not seeing their assessments jump to this level, and those people seem to think they're paying not enough taxes, and I completely agree with them. So please call for an assessment review in the city so that we can

278
01:50:52,139 --> 01:51:13,992
to realize that not everyone's house is worth what the flip next door is saying it is. Thank you, Cheryl. Point of information, Councilman Knight. Mr. President, I do believe statutorily, underneath the Department of Revenue, we are required to do real valuation every, I believe it's eight years, a defined period of eight years, every eight years we do a

279
01:51:14,077 --> 01:51:28,538
It's 05 is it now? I think I might have changed it. So we actually do have a team that goes out into the community and does assessments, real assessments based upon appraisals as required by the Department of Revenue and in compliance thereof.

280
01:51:29,433 --> 01:51:48,535
you are correct. I'm happy to send you some, a few addresses that you can compare to mine and see that my assessment has jumped by a couple of hundred thousand dollars and Maryland's nowhere near that. So it's not being done evenly applied across the city, which is why I asked for an audit.

281
01:51:49,632 --> 01:52:02,103
Thank you. Thank you, Cheryl. Let me, I just want to remind everybody you have a minute and a half when you speak or have your question. I will now call upon, let's see, Will Navar? I'm sorry.

282
01:52:06,203 --> 01:52:29,778
Thank you, President Falco, William Navarro, 108 Medford Street, apartment B. I think it's really, the canonical example here, we have a single-family home turned into a bigger single-family home. The original single-family home was unaffordable to ordinary working people, and the new single-family home was unaffordable to working people.

283
01:52:29,778 --> 01:52:50,483
So I consider that a net, not very much at all, other than I guess we get some more revenue. So I think it's important to look at the zoning. Make sure maybe when we do that, you see these lots, they seem fairly underdeveloped because you see the land value has gone up insane amounts because City of Boston is a very desirable place to live and work.

284
01:52:51,023 --> 01:53:08,540
And the house, it's just unlikely you have a $350,000 lot with a $200,000 building on it. I just don't think that makes a lot of sense. But ideally, rather than just build a massive single family home, we could build a duplex, triplex, tripledecker, something like that.

285
01:53:09,181 --> 01:53:36,063
And as for Miss Rodriguez's point about Mystic Avenue, she talked about a fee. I would say, before we talk about a fee for leaving property blighted, let's just stop giving a discount to blighted property. You put up a nice building, your taxes go up, you tear it down, your taxes go down. Why do we do it that way? It makes no sense. Tradition is the answer, but it's not solving problems here or really anywhere.

286
01:53:36,063 --> 01:54:00,464
So I hope we can take a look at that and about the zoning so that way we can, you know, zone so that families can sort of share the expensive land value by living in a duplex, triplex kind of thing. Thank you. Thank you, Will. Let's see. Next up is Kelly Catalo. Name and address for the record, please.

287
01:54:04,312 --> 01:54:23,853
I'm not saying that

288
01:54:23,853 --> 01:54:40,407
this is not just about the 18

289
01:54:40,407 --> 01:55:00,421
I think we can get everybody to the same meaning we can come up with some great resolutions that benefit everybody. Thank you. Thank you.

290
01:55:04,117 --> 01:55:24,232
And I think it's a growing

291
01:55:24,232 --> 01:55:46,895
I'd like to echo my fellow residents, Cheryl and William's comments about the exacerbated change in values when developers and flippers take a parcel and take a single or a two-family and make mansions where those were, further eroding our housing affordability within the city.

292
01:55:46,996 --> 01:56:16,139
And I want to just point out, when we say investing in a community, it's far more than dollars invested in a community. You can be highly invested in a community and not invest a penny. We have many people who advocate in this city, and they are investing in ways other than knocking down a house and putting up a new one. These developers are not investing in our community. They are investing in their projects, and they are doing it repeatedly.

293
01:56:16,139 --> 01:56:20,307
lather, rinse, repeat. Madcalf, Walnut, Thomas,

294
01:56:20,560 --> 01:56:47,864
Forest Street, Park Street, Court Street, Washington Street, Pleasant Street, Winthrop Street, Bower Street, South Street, just off the top of my head, the same thing over and over. Buy it for less than 500, sell one part of it for over seven. That does nothing to create housing affordability and everything to make these people a lot of money. And the gigantic holes in our zoning

295
01:56:47,864 --> 01:57:17,159
and loopholes in our zoning perpetuate this. I would urge you, urge you to take on your primary responsibility of zoning review and zoning reform that creates purposeful development, that creates the things that are important to our community and does in fact invest in our community. Thank you so much for your time. Thank you. And our zoning kickoff meeting will be coming up on September 23rd, just to let everyone know.

296
01:57:17,969 --> 01:57:47,652
Next up, we have Ryan Haywood. Ryan, I'm about to unmute you. If you could please have your name and address for the record, please. You have a minute and a half. Ryan. Ryan Haywood? Okay, we'll skip over Ryan.

297
01:57:48,513 --> 01:57:56,427
Clerk Carter Beach, you said someone wanted to speak, I believe. Mr. President, that's correct. Paul Thumbel asked to speak.

298
01:58:09,893 --> 01:58:37,147
Hi, thanks for giving me a second here. I just wanted to kind of lend a unique combination. And I spoke earlier this summer, if you don't recognize me, I had the huge beard last time some of you saw me. I have a good combination. I'm a local resident. I live on Douglas Road. I'm a small business owner. My wife is a builder. She comes from the architecture design world. So we are a small business owner in Medford and we,

299
01:58:37,147 --> 01:58:54,072
on a very small scale are developing and building one or two projects in the Medford area a year. I'm also a tenured professor in the Business School of Northeastern, so I can kind of address, I see the vision of the economic impact that Councilor Knight had brought up.

300
01:58:54,072 --> 01:59:09,243
And I know as a small business, we keep talking about these big developers, but as a small builder who lives and works in Medford, I quite literally invest my family's life savings every time we do a project.

301
01:59:10,306 --> 01:59:26,658
The historical commission is a huge part of our city. I think in a different life, I would have been a history professor instead of a business professor. I love history. We strive in every project we do to save as much as we can. We have an obligation as a city to protect our history.

302
01:59:27,637 --> 01:59:49,355
And I logged in today to talk about a project that's getting debated later in the call today. But I can tell you the economic impact that one of my small projects has. I hire 10 to 12 subs, subcontractors, sub-small business owners themselves. So we're talking council nice numbers is conservative.

303
01:59:49,355 --> 02:00:14,093
50, 60, 70 people come on my projects, and that's just a small project. Tens of thousands of dollars in permit fees for my small projects. And so all of my employees, when they go out for lunch, they're eating in Medford Square. They're loving the Tanakh. They're loving the Goldilocks. They are shopping local. They're eating local every day.

304
02:00:14,093 --> 02:00:43,507
The economic impact for me, if the Historical Commission can put my projects on hold for 18 months, could potentially bankrupt a small business owner like me. I cannot afford, at $5,000 to $8,000 a month, to wait for a potential hold to come through. If we get a full 18-month review, you're talking over $100,000 in financial impact. I'm one person. I don't have $100,000 to sit on.

305
02:00:43,507 --> 02:01:10,895
Paul, your time is up. Thank you. I apologize for interrupting. I'm not sure what happened to Paul. Ryan Haywood was up next, but I. Ryan Haywood, name and address for the record.

306
02:01:12,059 --> 02:01:40,848
I just want to point out to the City Council and just let everybody know here that we are, as a commission, taking note of everything that's being said. We do want to be helpful, and we want to get you guys the information that you need. So we'll be sure to send you over the information as soon as we can get it to you.

307
02:01:41,962 --> 02:02:02,819
Councilor Night, seconded by? Second. Councilor Beers, Clerk Urnaby, please call the roll. Councilor Beers? Yes. Vice President Caraballo? Yes. Councilor Night? Yes. Councilor Marks? Yes. Councilor Morrell? Yes.

308
02:02:08,725 --> 02:02:29,819
Yes. Councilor Morales, a yes? Yes. Councilor Scarpelli? Yes. President Falco? Yes. 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative. The motion passes. 20-527 offered by Council night be it resolved that the Memphis City Council extend its deepest and sincere condolences to the family of Edward Tyrantz on his recent passing.

309
02:02:30,562 --> 02:02:49,428
Counselor Knight. Mr. President, thank you very much. It's with deep sadness that I offer this resolution this evening. Eddie Terrence was a kid, I grew up with him, West Medford. A West Medford fixture, a West Medford legend. Had the opportunity of going to elementary school with Eddie, high school with Eddie, and always hanging out with him down the park.

310
02:02:50,356 --> 02:03:18,689
Whether it be placed in a park or dug a park, playing basketball, everywhere in between, causing havoc, riding our bikes and the such, Mr. President. But Eddie passed away unexpectedly just over the last couple of weeks with a little heart problem, a little heart trouble. And he's no longer with us. And Eddie was the type of kid that made everybody around him just better. When Eddie was there, he put you in a better mood. He had a smile that could light up a room and a personality that could make the shyest person the most friendly person in the world.

311
02:03:18,689 --> 02:03:33,775
A long time husband to Donna Doherty, CJ Doherty and Chuck Doherty's daughter and sister. And just an all around great kid, Mr. President. And I'm very sad to see him go and it's one of those.

312
02:03:33,927 --> 02:03:51,494
situations where when someone's gone, you wish you had the opportunity to spend more time with them. And Eddie was one of those kids, and I don't think there's anybody that knows Eddie that could say right now that they wish they didn't spend more time with him now that he's gone. So with that being said, Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in offering an offerings of condolences.

313
02:03:51,494 --> 02:04:11,997
It's very unfortunate turn of events. I was on social media the other day and someone posted a picture. And it was a picture right across the hall in the mayor's office. And it was Eddie sitting down in Mayor McGlynn's chair with Mayor McGlynn next to him.

314
02:04:12,183 --> 02:04:40,313
There was a kid named Cedric Taylor sitting next to Eddie, who's no longer with us as well, and Justin Springer. And if we think back to a couple months ago, this council just recognized Justin Springer for the work that he's done in the city of Boston, doing outreach and communications work with the less fortunate. So it's very sad, Mr. President, when you reach a certain age and you see a picture like that of kids you grew up with in elementary school and in junior high and in high school, and two out of three of them are gone, they're no longer with us.

315
02:04:40,313 --> 02:04:54,404
So it just saddens me to see that he's gone, because like I said, he's a great person. And I'd ask my council colleagues to join me in supporting the family and offering this condolence to the family in this time of need. Thank you, Councilor Knight. At this point, I'd ask.

316
02:04:54,843 --> 02:05:17,557
Yes, let's see, Councilor Marks. I want to thank Councilor Knight for putting this on. Those who knew Ed knew he was a great person and good person to be around and he will sorely be missed, Mr. President. I also would like to mention we lost a resident just recently, Giovanni Puccio.

317
02:05:17,557 --> 02:05:44,371
On his recent passing, Mr. President, he was a tremendous father, husband, family man, and just a terrific guy. And he will be solely missed, Mr. President, as well. So I'd ask if my council colleague wouldn't mind putting that on as well, Mr. President. Mr. President. Thank you. Councilor Marks, thank you. And that will be added to the resolution as well as an amendment.

318
02:05:45,603 --> 02:06:04,469
I'd like to thank Councilman Knight for bringing this up. What a great young man and working for Method Recreation and the boys at Duggar Park and Eddie's family and friends. I know how important he was to everybody.

319
02:06:04,469 --> 02:06:27,014
And just a great, great young man. So my prayers to his family and our condolences. And I appreciate Councilor Mox bringing up Mr. Puccio's name. I know that it's tough when you don't have week after week meeting and people pass on in between. So this has been very difficult, but what a great person, left a great legacy.

320
02:06:27,014 --> 02:06:47,551
His kids are committed, they're men and women that are committed to our community and making sure that they're giving back. And that's because he instilled that sense of community, and I think that he'll solely be missed. So my condolences to the Puccio family too, so thank you. Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

321
02:06:49,373 --> 02:07:18,128
Let's see, so we will have a moment of silence in one second. We just have to vote on this first. So on the motion of Councilor Knight, as amended by Councilor Marks, and seconded by... Second. Councilor Scott Kelly. Councilor Morrell, did you want to speak on this? No, I was just getting my mic ready. Oh, okay. Okay. So on that motion, Clerk Hutterby, please call the roll.

322
02:07:18,955 --> 02:07:42,749
Yes. Vice President Caravaglia. Yes. Council Knight. Yes. Council Marks. Yes. Council Morrell. Yes. Councilor Scarpelli. Yes. President Falco. Yes. On the 7 to 0 vote, the motion passes. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Tyrantz and Puccio families. At this point in time, I'd ask everyone to please rise for a brief moment of silence.

323
02:08:12,955 --> 02:08:36,682
20-528 offered by Councilor Knight. Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council recognize the efforts of the community partner Armstrong Ambulance, most notably Gail Armstrong, Richard Armstrong, and Sean Mangan, for their contributions toward the success of the August 18th and 19th COVID-19 screening for Medford High School families. Councilor Knight. Mr. President, thank you very much.

324
02:08:37,762 --> 02:08:54,653
We've all been around Gail Armstrong, Richie Raymond, Sean Mangan at one point or another being involved in this community. And the outreach work that Armstrong Ambulance does and the give backs that they give to this community are innumerable.

325
02:08:54,788 --> 02:09:16,979
Just recently, about a month ago, Armstrong Ambulance was tasked with the responsibility of helping do COVID testing for the MHS families up at Medford High School. And to say that that was a momentous task is an understatement. But through their efforts and that of our friends in the Board of Health, they were able to pull it off.

326
02:09:17,198 --> 02:09:40,317
When you look at the testing that's been done in our community versus surrounding communities, you'll see that Medford's probably, at the time that this was done, about 1,000 tests ahead of the nearest community. I think the only community around here was Lynn that had tested more people than the city of Medford. So it goes to say and it goes to show that

327
02:09:40,317 --> 02:09:59,572
The strength of community partnerships can go a long way in all aspects of public life, but especially public health here. We've seen the community rise up and come together during this coronavirus situation. And I think that the efforts in the work of Gail, Richie, and Sean shouldn't go unnoticed, Mr. President.

328
02:09:59,572 --> 02:10:24,665
Not only in this endeavor, but in all that they do. Whether it comes to the free CPI training that they give to our coaches or the IADs that they've donated to our community. Armstrong does a lot, and I think it's important that we recognize what they do and the work that they do. So with that being said, I'm asking my council colleagues to support me in this agenda item this evening. Thank you, Councilman Knight. Vice President Caviello.

329
02:10:26,048 --> 02:10:55,225
Thank you for bringing this up. The Armstrong family, Rich and Sean, they've been great people for our community. I mean, I've had the opportunity to work with them on many projects. I've been trained by Sean Manion many times to be CPS certified, Red Cross certified. So again, these are good people. They're there all the time. Long before the COVID, this company has been out there.

330
02:10:55,225 --> 02:11:23,913
Anytime the community has needed some assistance with anything, they've been there. So again, I thank them for the work that they've done in our community. Thank you, Vice President Caviello. On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by- Second. Seconded by Vice President Caviello. Clerk, please call the roll. Councilor Behrs? Yes. Vice President Caviello? Yes. Councilor Knight? Yes. Councilor Knight?

331
02:11:25,330 --> 02:11:30,629
have a motion to approve the

332
02:11:31,523 --> 02:11:55,705
Councilor Strapelli? Yes. President Falco? Yes. Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative. The motion passes. 20-529 offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council be provided with a monthly report of crime statistics from the Chief of Police. Councilor Knight. Mr. President, thank you very much. And I know Councilor Mox has a similar paper on the agenda this evening. I bring this paper forward.

333
02:12:03,215 --> 02:12:30,704
Thank you, Mr. President. If my council colleague wouldn't mind adding my paper on to this, paper 20-542, where they are similar in nature. Sure. Would you like to make a motion to join the papers? Please. I second that motion and defer it to a senior member. On the motion of Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Night to join the papers, and that would be 20-529 off by Councilor Night.

334
02:12:32,797 --> 02:13:00,758
542. 542 offered by Councilor Marks. That paper reads, be it resolved that the recent rash of break-ins and home invasions be discussed in the interest of public safety. Clerk Hertoghez, could you please call the roll on joining those two papers? Correct. And just so I'm clear, 20542, that was the emergency paper you added under suspension, Councilor Marks? Correct. OK. And this is to join the two.

335
02:13:01,720 --> 02:13:26,662
Councilor Beres? Yes. Vice President Caraballo? Yes. Yes. Thank you. Councilor Knight? Yes. Councilor Marks? Yes. Councilor Morrell? Yes. Councilor Scarpelli? Yes. President Falco? Yes. Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative. The motion passes and the papers are joined. At this point I recognize Councilor Knight.

336
02:13:28,045 --> 02:13:50,945
Mr. President, thank you very much, and thank you to Councilor Mox for allowing me to proceed first. I bring this paper forward, Mr. President, in light of a recent string of troubling events that have been brought to my attention. Home break-ins in the West Medford neighborhood, home invasions in the heights in South Medford, in the West Medford neighborhood.

337
02:13:50,945 --> 02:14:20,932
We have a crime analyst, Mr. President, that we budgeted, and the crime analyst does an excellent job. And I know that our decision makers in the police department are using that data to make good policy recommendations and good policing recommendations. But I think it's also important, Mr. President, that we have the opportunity to review this data to see what type of crime is happening in our community, whether it's violent crime, whether it's crime of personal property, whether it's domestic violence, whether it is.

338
02:14:20,932 --> 02:14:38,330
any number of identifiable trends or patents that will allow us to be dynamic and flexible in our response to it, Mr. President. I'm more than happy to sit down and discuss supplemental funding. I'm more than happy to sit down and discuss providing.

339
02:14:39,528 --> 02:14:58,546
any department in this community with the tools that they need to succeed. And I think it's very important for us to have a good understanding as to what the trends are and what the patents are in this community, so that we can get ahead of it and invest money in certain areas that we need to invest money in. For example, we have Harold McGilvery, he's our dog officer. He's an awesome dog officer, he does a great job.

340
02:15:00,335 --> 02:15:23,690
Maybe based upon the crime statistic and crime trends, we need two dog officers. We have a traffic division. We have a traffic division comprised of so many officers. Maybe based upon the crime statistics and the accident statistics, it shows that we should be having more officers in the traffic division and less officers in another division. Operational questions, Mr. President, certainly stuff that comes under the purview and scope of the Chief of Police.

341
02:15:23,690 --> 02:15:53,255
But that's something that's contingent and reliant upon funding. And if we're going to be spending the money, I want to make sure we're spending it in the right place to make the most impact and the most bang for our buck. And with the uptick in violent crime in this community, I think this is something that we really need to look at. And I shouldn't even say it's an uptick, because I don't know, because I haven't seen the stats. I should say with the public reporting of violent crime of recent in the community, I'm wondering if this is something that we need to be worried about. So with that being said, I'm going to defer to Councilor Mox, Mr. President, but thank you very much for indulging me.

342
02:15:53,356 --> 02:16:13,960
Thank you, Councilor Knight, Councilor Marks. Thank you, Mr. President. I want to thank my council colleague, Councilor Knight, for putting this on the agenda as well. For the past several years, Mr. President, I've called for a public safety summit within this community. And to date, I'm not proud to say that we have yet to have a public safety summit.

343
02:16:13,960 --> 02:16:40,083
with all the parties to be within this community to discuss these very issues. And Councilor Knight may not say it, but I am going to say it, Mr. President. Violent crime is on the uptick in this community. And you only have to read the paper, watch the local news, and talk to your neighbors. And you'll hear what's happening in this community, Mr. President. From home invasions, to car break-ins, to home break-ins.

344
02:16:40,083 --> 02:16:57,059
It's happening all over the community, and I think it's very important. I realize we do have a crime analyst in the community that's gathering crime data. But the data is only as good, Mr. President, when it's being used for.

345
02:16:57,059 --> 02:17:26,455
So if it's not being used to update and provide the latest and greatest for our police department, then it's not good data. If it's not used, Mr. President, to get the word out to the community, and that is key. That is key in this community. I've talked to a lot of seniors in this community that are unaware, Mr. President, on what's happening. And I tell people constantly that may leave their front door open or their car unlocked to say, you know what?

346
02:17:26,455 --> 02:17:43,010
Those days are behind us. I hate to say it, they're behind us now. And you should always proceed with caution. And I believe you should be locking your front door, even during the day, Mr. President. I believe you should be locking your car. You should be watching out for your neighbors. You should leave a light on.

347
02:17:43,010 --> 02:17:59,547
that may deter someone from robbing a house or a car or so forth. But I think the announce of prevention goes a long way, the old saying. And we have to get word out to the community, not to alarm people, but to let them know what's happening.

348
02:17:59,547 --> 02:18:14,920
To let them know that they should take extra precaution, Mr. President. And I ask that our police department step up patrol around the community. I ask that we do have this public safety summit to discuss some of the concerns we have.

349
02:18:14,920 --> 02:18:36,588
Just recently, Mr. President, and I won't get into the details, we had a home invasion that involved a 92-year-old woman that luckily, Mr. President, was able to escape. because God knows what would have resulted if she was not able to escape, Mr. President. And there's been some scuttlebutt around the community that this person may have been part of.

350
02:18:36,588 --> 02:19:05,444
a halfway house in the community, and living in our neighborhood, and living amongst us, Mr. President. And that raises some concern for residents, and rightfully so, Mr. President. So I think as a community, we have to take a step back and look at what's happening in our community, ways we can address issues, ways we can make our residents safer, Mr. President. We have a large percentage of seniors, and seniors are very vulnerable, Mr. President.

351
02:19:05,444 --> 02:19:33,001
So that's my concern. I would ask once again that we create a public safety summit. I'm not sure why it's impossible to get a public safety summit together. I think I must have offered it three or four times. And I've yet to get any buy-in from the former chief or this chief or anyone else, Mr. President, administration or anyone else to sit down and discuss these issues.

352
02:19:33,001 --> 02:19:55,900
Because this is hitting home now. It's not somewhere you're saying, well, this happens here or there. It's happening in our neighborhoods. It's happening to our neighbors. And it's concerning, Mr. President. So I just want to put that out there, that once again I ask for a public safety summit where we can sit down around the table and discuss some of the concerns we have. If it's funding, then as Councilor Knight mentioned,

353
02:19:55,900 --> 02:20:14,041
then the council should be aware of that. If it's additional manpower, if it's additional tools that the police department needs to get the job done. If it's additional outreach, community outreach, then so be it to make sure that residents are aware of what's happening. I've asked in the past to use the reverse 911.

354
02:20:14,041 --> 02:20:31,642
You know, it's great to get when there's a road race in the city and you get a reverse 9-1-1, but 9-1-1 is for emergency. What better emergency than if there are home invasions and people being attacked in our community, Mr. President? You know, and how blatant

355
02:20:31,642 --> 02:20:45,412
when someone's sitting there and someone jumps through a picture window, a glass picture window, with the person sitting right there. They weren't trying to avoid detection. They weren't trying to avoid the person.

356
02:20:46,323 --> 02:21:12,209
These are very serious incidences, Mr. President, and they need to be discussed and addressed. And I realize the police are probably working on their own, and things that they can't relay to the public, and I realize that. But I also believe the public should be well aware of what's going on, and we should be open and notorious when it comes to alerting residents of this community. And I want to thank my colleague for putting this on. Thank you, Councilor Mox. Councilor Behrs.

357
02:21:13,087 --> 02:21:37,471
Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, colleagues, for putting it on. I completely agree that we need to look at trends and patterns and really be able to analyze and make the best decisions possible. So I'd just, you know, I'd like to amend the paper for getting reports and data back to the year 2000, if possible. I understand that might take more time, so I'm not going to put a time limit on it, but I would love to be able to see the long-term trends. Thank you.

358
02:21:37,876 --> 02:21:52,102
Thank you, Counselor Pierce. Point of information, Mr. President. Point of information, Counselor Knight. I do not believe we had a crime analyst going back that far. I think a crime analyst was something that

359
02:21:52,321 --> 02:22:14,849
I believe in your first term, Councilor Scott-Pelly's first term was something that we had put into the budget. So while I think that the data exists in terms of paper records and paper files, there wasn't someone there that was actually working as a crime analyst compiling that stuff and looking at trends and patterns and the such. So I'd ask that it be offered in the B papers to not hold up the underlying paper that's been offered on top of it.

360
02:22:15,760 --> 02:22:45,646
That's fine with me. I'm putting a timeline on it. It seems like there's data going back a few years. That could be really helpful, and maybe longer if it's there. Thank you, Councilor Behrs. Clerk Hutterby, do you have the language on the B paper? Yes, Mr. President. I have a question after that. Councilor Behrs originally offered an amendment, which is now a B paper, requesting reports and data back to the year 2000 on crime statistics.

361
02:22:46,253 --> 02:23:08,073
if possible. OK. And then I have another question, if I may. Yep. Councilor Marks, you asked for a minute to the papers. I'm sorry, I didn't hear that. I didn't hear that. Did you say it was an amendment? Were you asking if it's an amendment?

362
02:23:08,326 --> 02:23:37,047
I'm asking if Councilor Marks' request to create a public safety summit is an amendment to the papers. I didn't hear the answer. Yes. Thank you. Excuse me. Okay, so let's see. So we get a B paper from Councilor Behrs. Is that B paper seconded? Seconded. Seconded by Councilor Morrell.

363
02:23:44,489 --> 02:24:13,447
We have Councilor Marks, did you wanna speak? Nope, okay. Councilor Knight. That's on from the beginning. Okay, I'm gonna shut it off. Okay, let's see. Okay, do we have any questions or comments from the public? Okay, seeing and hearing none. Okay, on the B paper, offered by Councilor Behrs, seconded by Councilor Morrell.

364
02:24:13,750 --> 02:24:36,059
Court of Appeals, please call the roll. Councilor Behrs? Yes. Vice President Caraballo? Yes. Councilor Knight? Yes. I'm sorry, I didn't hear Councilor Knight. Yes. Thank you. Councilor Marks? Yes. Thank you. Councilor Morrell? Yes.

365
02:24:37,072 --> 02:25:05,911
Councilor Scarpelli? Yes. President Franco? Yes. Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative. The motion passes. On the main paper offered by Councilor Knight and Councilor Marks. Seconded by Vice President Carviello. Clerk Carter, please call the roll. Councilor Behrs? Yes. Vice President Carviello? Yes. Councilor Knight? Yes. Councilor Marks? Yes. Councilor Morrell? Yes.

366
02:25:06,603 --> 02:25:26,887
Councilor Scarpelli? Yes. President Franco? Yes. Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes. 20-530 offered by Councilor Morrell. Be it resolved that the Medford City Council demand that the MBTA reinstate bus routes 325 and 326 as they are an essential link to residents of Medford. Councilor Morrell.

367
02:25:26,887 --> 02:25:53,988
Thank you, Mr. President. Yeah, I know this is something that has been raised by Councilor Marks a few months back when these two lines, which are the express lines from Medford, were suspended, as we were told, temporarily in the earlier days of the pandemic. We do have in our packet this week some back and forth from the mayor and Todd Blake with the MBTA, and the way the MBTA inevitably thanked the mayor for advocacy is suspending these routes indefinitely in mid-August.

368
02:25:53,988 --> 02:26:14,238
So this is especially concerning to me because frontline workers, which are going into work every day, are people who are more likely to need public transportation. And we have essentially cut them off from these express routes, not we, the MBTA. And I did speak with our state delegation about this, and they are working on it.

369
02:26:14,238 --> 02:26:32,716
What they told me that we can do is really show a unified front on this, so I'm just asking moving approval on this paper to really demand that the MBTA reinstate these essential links and help people from Medford get on those express routes into Boston where they need to go get to work. Thank you. Second, Mr. President.

370
02:26:32,935 --> 02:26:55,092
Thank you, Councilor Morrell. On the motion of Councilor Morrell, seconded by Councilor Pierce. Councilor Scarpelli, you didn't want to- Thank you, Mr. President. Councilor Scarpelli. So I spoke with our state delegates with Councilor, Representative Donato and Representative Garbale. I think that I asked them for permission to hold a committee.

371
02:26:55,092 --> 02:27:11,866
a subcommittee meeting on transportation to bring them back because the exact words they used, that they were lied to by the administration of the T. So that's bothersome considering those gentlemen and

372
02:27:11,866 --> 02:27:40,452
And their partner in crime and Christine Barber have other people that make sure they get their funding needed to make sure their business runs. So these are the MO, this is the MO for the T that they promise and don't fulfill what they've asked, what they say when they come in. I know that we have many resolutions that can show that, so I did talk to our

373
02:27:40,705 --> 02:28:01,158
representatives and did talk to a few people that traversed that route. And if we can, I know that we're very fortunate we have our city clerk that knows all the ins and outs and the people that need to be called. So I'm going to call on Adam Herterbees, if he can, to help us again.

374
02:28:01,158 --> 02:28:23,990
To get those people that we need at a table, I think that before we do that, I think we need to do a ridership study that shows the numbers. I know the numbers are down right now, but that doesn't mean, that really doesn't mean anything because like we're saying, it's quality instead of quantity now. So we need those buses and

375
02:28:23,990 --> 02:28:53,977
We'll be calling for a subcommittee meeting. They're ready to go whenever you are, Council President, where we can find a date that's open and get those representatives at a table to answer a lot of questions. I mean, we're also waiting for the Department of Transportation to still give us an answer on, ready, south of Maine. So as we're seeing traffic pick up now, there was a lull, so there wasn't a outcry, but as you're seeing the traffic

376
02:28:53,977 --> 02:29:12,117
uptick that we're going to start seeing some issues again. It's something we need to do. So thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli. Councilor Behrs? Thank you, Mr. President. I think actually Councilor Scarpelli made most of the points. Again, it's just an example of

377
02:29:12,860 --> 02:29:42,644
poor communication or directly false communication made to people in the city around this issue. So I completely agree. And I did not know that they were also sending their communications to our state delegation as well. So it sounds like we have some issues to address here. Thank you, Councilor Behrs. Councilor Knight. Mr. President, I find this ironic. I find it ironic that the MBTA cuts the express bus service that people take.

378
02:29:42,745 --> 02:29:43,960
because

379
02:29:44,399 --> 02:30:13,660
The other modes of transit that the t office is so inefficient and unreliable. I mean, ultimately, you take the bus, you take the 325. Counselor Mox takes the 325. You take the 325 because you don't want to take a bus to a train station and miss the bus or wait for a bus that's late to get to the train station to be packed in like a sardine or miss the first two trains when you get there because there's no room for you to get on the train. So it's nonsensical to me in a way, Mr. President. It's like they created these express lanes because people,

380
02:30:13,660 --> 02:30:43,208
Needed to get to work and couldn't rely on the existing modalities that the MBTA was offering, right? So here we are now, going back, and they're going to cut these from our community, which is fine. They're going to cut them, okay, that's what you want to do. I'm assuming that there's going to be a corresponding cut in our assessment, because our assessment's based on the level of service that we receive. And if they're cutting our services, then they should also be cutting our assessments. So my question would be also, what impact does this have on the MBTA's assessment to the community of Medford, where they're cutting service for the bus line.

381
02:30:43,208 --> 02:31:06,547
The assessments for our bus service should be cut as well. So I'd ask that question as to what the correlating assessment reduction with the reduction in these bus lines. I'd offer that in the form of an amendment. Thank you, Councilor Knight. So that is an amendment to the paper. Second the amendment. I'm still copying the amendment down.

382
02:31:18,055 --> 02:31:47,249
Mr. President, I also neglected to- I also neglected to offer that as amendment too, that our clerk reach out to the state delegates who already know and the representatives from the T to one, begin by putting a study, a ridership study together and be prepared to hold a subcommittee on transportation as soon as possible.

383
02:31:48,025 --> 02:32:14,789
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

384
02:32:15,717 --> 02:32:42,802
is to have the former MBTA Chief of Staff reach out to the State Delegation and the MBTA. And also to commission a ridership study. And then meet in the Subcommittee on Transportation. The State Delegates, correct. And the State Delegation, yes. Thank you. I'll take that former Chief of Staff too.

385
02:32:43,983 --> 02:33:03,187
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli. Thank you, Councilor Knight. Councilor Marks. Thank you, Mr. President. I want to thank Councilor Morrell for bringing this up. There's a pattern here. Over the last two years, mostly two years, the MBTA has tried to cut a number of bus routes.

386
02:33:03,187 --> 02:33:26,373
over and over again, Mr. President, and residents have to stand up and fight and contact the T and contact the state delegation and the mayor and the city council. And it's pretty disturbing that an MBTA, that their chief mission is to provide access of transportation, and they're constantly looking to cut back.

387
02:33:26,373 --> 02:33:46,943
transportation in surrounding communities. So that's number one, Mr. President. For full disclosure, I do, for the past four years, I've taken both the 325 and the 326. So some of this is from my own selfish standpoint, someone that takes that bus and has been on the bus with

388
02:33:46,943 --> 02:34:02,114
many, many other people that rely on that bus for transportation to and from work, Mr. President. Counselor Knight hit the nail on the head. And I've been talking about this literally for, I hate to say it, probably close to 20 years.

389
02:34:03,076 --> 02:34:30,312
Let me tell you. The MBTA has over $66 million in tax-exempt property in this community. Tax-exempt, Mr. President. $66 million that they don't pay the city of Method one nickel for. Their assessment to us for providing T services as of 2017 was about $3.7 million.

390
02:34:31,055 --> 02:34:57,059
So that's what they charge us over and above when you pay a fare, when you get your T-card, when you pay 20% of the 5% sales tax. That's over and above we pay as a community, as Councilor Knight mentioned, for this particular service. So when we have an express bus, we have additional routes, people say, wow, Method has great access. We pay for it, Mr. President, in many surrounding communities.

391
02:34:57,262 --> 02:35:24,413
Winchester, Arlington, you name it. They come to Method to jump on the express bus, or to get on the train in West Method, or to go to Wellington. They come into our community. We're paying a heavy assessment. And he's absolutely right. Back some years ago, I offered a motion, which was passed and sent to our state delegation many years ago, that we offset the T assessment.

392
02:35:24,413 --> 02:35:28,835
based on the tax-exempt property they have in our community.

393
02:35:29,020 --> 02:35:57,792
So if it's 3.7 million that they come and take from us to operate services, they owe us 66 million for having tax exempt property in the community. So that's how we offset it. Needless to say, it never went anywhere in the state legislature. But that's a whole other story for another time. Method has the sixth highest assessment out of the 175 communities that use the local assistance fund. We have the sixth highest assessment.

394
02:35:58,653 --> 02:36:17,148
So when it's mentioned, like Councilman Wright mentioned that, you know what, if they're going to take service away, why wouldn't you cut the assessment? Why wouldn't you cut that assessment? We're paying for it. It's not something we're getting for free. We're paying for it through many different streams.

395
02:36:18,278 --> 02:36:43,726
It comes right off our charity sheet. So whatever local aid we get from the state, they look at it and say, okay, you're going to get 15 million. We're taking 3.7 million from the T assessment. So we're paying, Mr. President. And I think the T should answer to this. They really need to answer. So I support what Councilor Knight offered. I'd also like to know, Mr. President,

396
02:36:44,553 --> 02:36:56,872
How are they going to start to pay us back for the $66 million in tax-exempt property they have in this community? Between Wellington Station, the car bonds on Salem Street.

397
02:37:00,567 --> 02:37:20,041
So I appreciate my colleague putting this on there, and I'd like to hear back from the MBTA to find out exactly, Mr. President. If this is a temporary cut or reduction in service, that's one thing. That's not the impression I'm getting. Once they make the cut, it's going to be very difficult to get it back.

398
02:37:21,475 --> 02:37:43,328
You remember the days, Mr. President, that we had a fight because there were so many people standing on the 325 and 326. It became a safety concern. You are correct. It was over the capacity. And we asked them to put on additional buses because the 325 and 326 couldn't accommodate the needs of our community.

399
02:37:47,024 --> 02:38:15,273
And they never did so, Mr. President. I think they may have put on a route here and there, and then they ended up, yeah, I think they ended up putting one route on, and then they ended up canceling that. But that shows you the need in the community. I realize COVID has decreased the need, but it's gonna come back. Everything's gonna come back, and that's gonna come back. And I don't wanna be behind the eight ball, Mr. President, when residents are looking for the 325 and 326. So I would ask that you give us a commitment in the form of a motion, Mr. President.

400
02:38:16,066 --> 02:38:44,298
That this is just a temporary reduction in what their plans are for future service for the express bus. They want to keep people off the roads, they want to keep cars from going into Boston. Why would you eliminate express bus? We have an express lane. What's that used for if there's no express bus? You are correct. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Councilor Marks.

401
02:38:45,310 --> 02:39:05,763
And if I may, I thank Councilor Morrell for bringing this forward. And I know a number of councilors, Councilor Marks, in particular, and myself, I've brought up numerous resolutions about the 325 and the 326 bus for years. I've been a passenger on that 325 and the 326 for probably

402
02:39:05,763 --> 02:39:29,000
Probably just about 20 years now, and like Consular Marks mentioned, these bus routes have become more and more popular pre-pandemic than I've ever seen since I've been taking them. And one of my biggest concerns is when they said they were going to temporarily suspend service, that they would never bring service back.

403
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:48,862
That seems to come to fruition now, and I did give Representative Donato a call today to talk specifically about this. And he basically told me the same thing he told Councilor Scarpelli, and that is that the MBTA lied to him and to the whole entire state delegation. It's very unfortunate. I know he is.

404
02:39:48,862 --> 02:40:16,942
Representative Donato and the rest of the state delegation is fighting to bring this bus service back, the 325 and 326. I know they're working hard at it, but it's very unfortunate that the MBTA has done this. And I think knowing the MBTA, when we try to bring it back, they're not just going to bring it back, they're going to probably want all kinds of proof that ridership is there. And that's a piece I think that's going to be.

405
02:40:16,942 --> 02:40:46,928
Probably we had to prove because right now ridership is low due to the pandemic. So Councilor Scarpelli, I like the idea of scheduling a subcommittee to look at this and bring in the state delegation and bring in the MBTA and ask really good solid questions. And really getting them to commit to a timetable as to when they're going to bring things back or when they're going to reevaluate. But this needs to be addressed.

406
02:40:46,928 --> 02:41:16,223
And it needs to be addressed sooner than later. So, Councilor Morrelle, thank you for bringing this forward tonight. And at this time, I would call upon Councilor Behrs. Thank you, Mr. President. You just used the phrase temporarily suspended, and it reminded me, I'm pretty sure the E branch of the Green Line past Heath Street has been temporarily suspended since 1998. And the clerk could correct me, but the A branch maybe has been temporarily suspended since 1969, so. Thank you. All right. Councilor Behrs, 1969 was before I was born. Sorry.

407
02:41:17,303 --> 02:41:44,405
Me, too. Thank you, Council of Bears. So on the motion of Councilor Morrell, seconded by Vice President Caballero, as amended by Councilor Knight, Councilor Scott Pelley, and Councilor Marks. Clerk Hertoghese. Actually, are there any questions on this before we call the roll? I don't see any hands raised. Clerk Hertoghese, please call the roll. Council of Bears. Yes.

408
02:41:45,856 --> 02:42:01,482
have a motion for approval.

409
02:42:02,039 --> 02:42:23,318
Councilor Scarpelli? Yes. President Falco? Yes. Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative. The motion passes. 2-0-531 offered by Vice President Caviello will be a result of the Memphis City Council request that the administration immediately provide funding to the clerk's office to hire additional personnel both permanent and temporary for the upcoming November and future elections.

410
02:42:24,027 --> 02:42:46,842
Vice President Caviello. Mr. President, I think Councilor Beas has a similar resolution, 20536, if you'd like to read that also. Yep, move to join. Was that 20560? 536. I'm sorry, 536, okay. So 20536 offered by Councilor Beas, whereas Medford residents had serious concerns about voting during the September 1st.

411
02:42:48,479 --> 02:43:05,405
State primary election, including missing materials, incorrect information, limited public statements, enforcing of some voters to vote in person without an effective mail option. Now therefore, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council urges the city administration to ensure that the registrars

412
02:43:05,405 --> 02:43:31,493
Our voters and city clerk have all resources and staff necessary to conduct the November 3rd general election given the significant increase in demand for mail ballots. Be it further resolved that the city administration provide ballot drop boxes at locations other than Memphis City Hall. Be it further resolved that all elections communications be translated into languages other than English in a prompt manner for public consumption.

413
02:43:31,848 --> 02:43:52,317
So the motion is by Councilor Caviello, seconded by Councilor Behrs to join these resolutions. Clerk Carter, please call the roll. Councilor Behrs? Yes. Vice President Caviello? Yes. Councilor Night? Yes. Councilor Marks? Yes. Councilor Morrell? Yes.

414
02:43:52,705 --> 02:44:15,031
Councilor Starkelli? Yes. President Falco? Yes, the affirmative, zero in the negative. The motions are joined. At this point, I call on Vice President Carviello. Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, I think we've all seen after this last election that the way we've done elections in the past are no longer viable.

415
02:44:15,250 --> 02:44:38,521
Especially with the early voting for a week, the mail-in ballots, this is no longer a one-day event like it has been in the past. The day of using volunteers to do this is now in the past. I think it's time that through the clerk's office and the election department that we come up with

416
02:44:38,521 --> 02:44:55,025
some staffing requirements and some funding mechanisms to bring our election process and voting process up to this new way of doing it.

417
02:44:55,818 --> 02:45:22,379
You know, we've talked about in the past how we encourage people to vote, we encourage people to vote. Well, I think this primary was a tremendous turnout. I think we had probably one of the best primaries we had in many, many years. And you saw the clerk struggle with staffing problems and funding problems. So again, I think it's time that the clerk and his election department

418
02:45:22,379 --> 02:45:37,685
start requesting some funding and start changing the ways that we've done in the past to bring it up the way voting is going to be going forward. Thank you, Councilor. Vice President Carviello.

419
02:45:38,258 --> 02:46:07,334
Councilor Fierros. Thank you, Mr. President. I agree with Vice President Caraballo wholeheartedly. I think it's necessary that we get the resources down. I'm almost able to talk, but he's washing his window. I really think it's important that we get resources to City Hall, including a permanent elections coordinator, which has clearly been requested over and over again. Additionally, I think there are some things we could do to

420
02:46:08,347 --> 02:46:24,479
make sure that residents are more informed and have the information in a more prompt way, as well as providing these ballot drop boxes in a couple other locations other than City Hall. I have spoken to the clerk extensively about this and I just want to relay, you know, I think the clerk did

421
02:46:24,479 --> 02:46:41,067
a very difficult job in very difficult circumstances in a way that produced a result that we can count on. So I want to make that clear, but that doesn't mean that we can't do more. And that doesn't mean that the clerk doesn't need more to do things right. We know the turnout's going to be significantly higher.

422
02:46:43,632 --> 02:47:12,573
On November 3rd, I think Councilor Scarpelli is also raising his hand. Everybody wants to talk on this, so keep going. But, you know, again, there's a lot that we can do to help. I have spoken with the clerk. I've also spoken with Chief of Staff Dave Rodriguez, and I'm confident that efforts are going to be made to accomplish the election in a better way in November. Thank you. Thank you, Councilor Peers. We have, oops, we have Councilor, Councilor Morrell.

423
02:47:13,197 --> 02:47:36,856
Thank you, Mr. President. Yeah, and I thank my fellow counselors for bringing this forth. I know we all heard from many residents about this and I did, I think we've talked about communication on a number of issues around this and I think it would be beneficial and I'd like to add it in the form of amendment to get a report from the clerk's communication that can be posted on the website or shared in another way that just addresses how

424
02:47:36,856 --> 02:47:59,890
we're addressing for this upcoming election to ensure that the mistakes that happened, and I know it has to do with volume and many issues, but that the mistakes that happened for the state primary do not happen again and people can have faith in whatever option or vehicle they use to vote for the November election. So I'd like to add that in the form of an amendment. Thank you, Councilor Morrell. Councilor Knight.

425
02:48:01,544 --> 02:48:29,827
Mr. President, thank you very much, and through to the city clerk and his team. Babe, Janice Haley, the registrars of voters, they didn't have an easy task. And they really didn't know what was going on until the last minute. And I think that the state didn't help us out in allowing us ample opportunity to plan properly. And because of that, we met some bumps in the road and snafus. But I think it's important to point out.

426
02:48:30,248 --> 02:48:59,088
the hours of work that these employees put in during early voting, vote by mail, and the like, Mr. President. And it expands further than just the clerk's office and the registrar's office. So the countless volunteers that were up here hour after hour, day after day during early voting. So I think it's important to point out that mistakes will happen and mistakes do happen. And as long as we identify that a mistake happened, we own it, which is one of Clerk Herderby's favorite things to do when a mistake happens.

427
02:48:59,088 --> 02:49:24,772
Provide corrective action, we're all going to be in a better place. And I think that the clerk has the team around him that's going to allow him to do that. All right, so with that being said, Mr. President, I know there were some bumps in the road, and I know that it could have been handled a little bit smoother. And I have all the confidence in the world and the team that's down there now that this won't happen again. But getting back to operations, and from an operational standpoint,

428
02:49:25,531 --> 02:49:31,184
Would it make sense for us, because of COVID, to condense the number of polling locations?

429
02:49:34,930 --> 02:50:04,917
Just a question to put out there, Mr. President. Do we need 15 polling locations when we have early voting and vote by mail, and then a lower turnout at the polls because of this? It's a question to chew on. It's a policy question that's going to have to go through the Board of Registrars of Voters. I know that it would probably require a homeward petition, because state law does mandate that I think there's, what, 4,000 voters per precinct, something like that. So it would take some work, Mr. President. But I don't know if it's an effort worth exploring or not.

430
02:50:04,917 --> 02:50:34,094
For the simple fact that it will reduce the cost of elections. There's ample opportunity and time for people to come in and early vote, vote by mail, and absentee vote. And we can consolidate the locations. We won't need as much personnel, so the margin of error might be smaller, is all I'm saying. So it's something to talk about, something to think about, Mr. President, that I look forward to discussing at a future committee of the whole, if possible. Thank you. Counselor Knight. We have Counselor Marks.

431
02:50:35,866 --> 02:50:55,660
Thank you, Mr. President. I want to thank Councilor Caviello and Councilor Biaz for putting this on tonight. If we recall when we were deliberating the budget, it was mentioned, I know I brought it up. The city clerk did request for an additional position within the registrar voters office.

432
02:50:55,660 --> 02:51:23,673
It never found its way into the budget, but there was a request. So at the time, the city clerk realized that due to the upcoming election, the nature of the election, what's going to be requested of his office, the amount of votes that will be potentially early voting, mail-in and so forth, that it required someone from the Registrar of Voters Office to coordinate these efforts.

433
02:51:23,673 --> 02:51:40,092
which currently doesn't exist right now. As my colleague mentioned, you have Mrs. Joyce, you have Mrs. Lamoni in there, you have Sandy that does a great job on, I believe, a part-time basis. You have a number of other staff people, Mr. President. They did the best they could.

434
02:51:40,092 --> 02:51:58,756
But clearly, the clerk who is also the chief election officer of the community felt fit that it would require additional personnel. And I think the time to stand up was during the budget, now it's after the fact.

435
02:51:58,756 --> 02:52:25,418
And I think we're all looking back saying, in retrospect, we probably should have asked for that position, even though it wasn't part of the budget, but was requested as, if you want to call it a wish list. And that would have been an important position, Mr. President, in my opinion, to make sure that our elections are on the up and up and the integrity of our elections, which should be of the utmost importance.

436
02:52:25,418 --> 02:52:49,955
us as elected officials and as a community, Mr. President. So I just want to put that out there that I don't think it's too late now if we do need it, Mr. President, that we as a council can ask that the city administration, which I'm going to do in the form of a motion, that the city administration put into

437
02:52:49,955 --> 02:53:18,203
language that would put forth the position of a coordinator in the registrar or voter's office. And I know the city clerk has the exact title and what the job description would be, Mr. President. And I would ask that he supply that on this resolution back to the city administration because we know it's going to be needed. It's not, as my council colleagues mentioned, this is not going to get any easier.

438
02:53:18,203 --> 02:53:44,714
in November or next year or the following election. And the position is needed, and it's a long time coming in this community, Mr. President. We're able to get through elections for many years, but I think now's the time we have to, as a community, step up our game and ensure the integrity of our elections. And in doing so, hire the appropriate personnel to make sure that happens. Second, Mr. President. Thank you, Councilor Marks. Councilor Marks, is that a

439
02:53:45,254 --> 02:54:04,188
That's a wrong motion. Is that a B paper? Yes, if you want to make it a B paper. That'll be a B paper. It's on the motion of Council Marks' B paper, seconded by Councilor Pierson here. Yep. Clerk Hertoghez, do you have the language on the B paper? Hang on just a second, Mr. President.

440
02:54:05,639 --> 02:54:19,527
for the city administration to put into the budget language for election coordinator in the registrar's and voters office with the language for that position to be supplied by the city clerk.

441
02:54:24,033 --> 02:54:48,502
Okay, and if I may add briefly, thank you to everyone in the clerk's office, the registrar voter's office. I know they are very hardworking. I know they go nonstop. They do a great job. Were there some issues? Yes, but I know that the clerk has been working on that. And the important thing is to figure out what those issues were and

442
02:54:48,721 --> 02:55:17,645
to make sure that they don't happen again. I know he's been, him and his team have been working on that, and they will continue to work on that. I know that they will do a great job in November, but I think it is also important that the administration look at supplying additional funding to make sure that those offices have the help that they need in November. So I thank the councilors for bringing this resolution forward, and at this point in time, since no one has a hand up, I-

443
02:55:18,353 --> 02:55:34,013
Councilor Scarpelli. Thank you. Thank you for my colleagues for bringing this forward. I think that I too talked to City Clerk and our administration. I think this is important that I think Councilor Carvell hit the nail on the head. This isn't.

444
02:55:34,182 --> 02:56:02,043
the elections of old, and I know that when you see Adam Hurtubise like I did on election day, it hurt me just watching him pound the pavement. So his staff works super hard and he puts in the extra hours, but I think sometimes hard work and overdoing it hourly isn't the answer. I think it's making sure that we give him

445
02:56:02,043 --> 02:56:31,591
the tools that are going to make them successful. Because again, what you're seeing, especially in today's society, you're opening yourself up for a lot of negativity and a lot of negative feedback. So especially with this upcoming presidential election, we want to make sure that we have everything in order so we eliminate any of the negativity. So again, I appreciate it, and I thank Claire Kurterbees and the staff for

446
02:56:31,760 --> 02:56:45,918
doing the work that they do, and I concur with Councilor Moxley. I think it's a great idea. We move forward with it. Thank you. Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli. We have, let's see, we have, I believe it's Marjorie wants to speak. Marjorie, name and address for the record, please.

447
02:56:48,044 --> 02:57:15,567
Hi, my name is Marcia Shearson. I live at 11 Upton Terrace in Redford. And I thank all of you for listening to me as you have many times in the past. This is an incredibly important issue to me because this is the most crucial election that's ever happened in my lifetime, which is longer than you might think.

448
02:57:16,478 --> 02:57:46,229
And my particular concern was around having sufficient ballot boxes supervised, if possible, around the city so that people who are unable to vote in person or maybe voting for the first time and not have transportation be able to cast their vote.

449
02:57:46,870 --> 02:58:11,592
And I thank you all for bringing this issue to your attention and all of your interest. The other concern I have is that there is a possibility that there may be more poll watching happening

450
02:58:11,592 --> 02:58:40,415
Thank you.

451
02:58:41,005 --> 02:59:05,845
Melissa Young, name and address for the record, Melissa. Hi, I'm Melissa Young, I'm at 68 Bolton Street, and I also sent in a letter, so I won't go into detail, and you guys have it for the record. I just want to say I would encourage you to support this resolution. I worked the March election, so I would also go ahead and say that I would not recommend reducing the number of polling locations, whether or not they get added on.

452
02:59:05,845 --> 02:59:18,552
That's another story. But we aligned at the door during the March election, and that was even nearly as busy as the previous election. In addition, a coordinator would help the city in just getting the communication on.

453
02:59:18,923 --> 02:59:48,016
I mean, when you have a dedicated staff member and this is their role to modernize things, things just happen faster. I just would encourage you to support it. And I have more examples in my letter to support, but I just wanted to provide that information. Thank you.

454
02:59:49,973 --> 03:00:18,695
Okay, Councilor Marks. Do you all set, Councilor Marks, just to make sure. Okay, thank you. I wasn't, did you have your hand up earlier or no? Clerk Carter-Bees, I wasn't. No, okay, perfect, okay. On the motion, so there's a number of papers here. So on the B paper that was offered by Councilor Knight, I'm sorry, Councilor Marks, and it was seconded by, I believe it was Councilor Beers. Clerk Carter-Bees, can you please call the roll?

455
03:00:20,348 --> 03:00:48,142
Councilor Behrs. Councilor Behrs, I didn't hear you. Councilor Behrs left the room. OK. Well, that explains why I didn't hear him. Vice President Caraballo. Yes. Yes. Councilor Mike. Yes. Councilor Marks. Yes. Councilor Morrell. Yes. Councilor Scarpelli. Yes. President Falco.

456
03:00:49,492 --> 03:01:18,550
Yes, and Councilor Beers just walked into the room. Yes. Was that a yes? That was a yes. OK, that's on the B paper. 7, the affirmative. 0, the negative. The motion passes on the B paper. On the main motion that was offered by, actually, by Vice President Caviello and Councilor Beers. Mr. President, I offer an amendment. Did it get a second? I offer an amendment.

457
03:01:19,073 --> 03:01:47,407
You offer an amendment? Yeah, to knock it. I can't remember if it's a second or not. On the main paper? Yes, on the main paper. Oh, OK. So Councilor Morrell had an amendment to the main paper. Yeah, I get it here. So on the motion of Vice President Carbiello and Councilor Behr, seconded by? Second. What's the second? As amended by Councilor Morrell? Yes, as amended by Councilor Morrell. Clerk Herderby, please call the roll. Who's the second on the motion?

458
03:01:49,398 --> 03:02:10,627
Councilor Scott Kelly. Thank you. Councilor Bears. Yes. Vice President Caraballo. Yes. Vice President Caraballo. Yes. Thank you. Councilor Night. Yes. Councilor Marks. Yes. Councilor Morrell. Yes.

459
03:02:11,420 --> 03:02:30,269
Councilor Scarpelli? Yes. President Falco? Yes. Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative. The motion passes. 2-0-532 offered by Vice President Caviello. Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council have the DCR repair the guardrail on Route 16 bridge in Auburn Street in the interest of public safety. Vice President Caviello.

460
03:02:37,238 --> 03:02:50,182
Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, this is something I put on about eight months ago. And it took a while to fix, and it was fixed. And three months later, the guardrail has been hit again.

461
03:02:50,317 --> 03:03:17,519
Just that spot. And again, the guardrail is on the side, it's broken onto the sidewalk and it's making it hard for people to traverse. So again, if we could refer this to Representative Garbling's office, I did speak to him briefly about it, but if you could send him an official thing in the DCR to have this repaired again in the interest of public safety. And Mr. President,

462
03:03:19,325 --> 03:03:41,212
While we're sending something to the DCR in to Representative Godley, on August 11th, I made a resolution, 20474, about removing the trees in the river. Because Paddle Boston's there, and a lot of people kayak and everything. It never went to the DCR, it ended up going to Aggie Jordan.

463
03:03:41,212 --> 03:04:09,730
And she wrote back that she has no jurisdiction over the waterway and the trees. So I think this 20474 should have gone to Representative Gabbard and the DCR. So if you want to combine these two together, when the clerk sends this paper to both offices. So why don't we amend it to have that paper sent to the correct agency to have the tree taken care of. Thank you.

464
03:04:11,198 --> 03:04:38,249
So on the motion of Vice President Caviello, seconded by Councilor Behrs, is amended by Vice President Caviello. Clerk, please call the roll. Councilor Behrs? Yes. Vice President Caviello? Yes. Councilor Knight? Yes. Councilor Marks? Yes. Councilor Morrell? Yes. Councilor Scarpelli? Yes.

465
03:04:38,890 --> 03:04:42,653
President Falco. Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

466
03:04:44,307 --> 03:05:10,042
2-0-533 offered by Vice President Caviello be resolved at the Memphis City Council. Have the school department have the two collection bins at the Andrews School emptied as soon as possible in the interest of public health. Mr. Caviello? Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, I was by the Andrews School last week, and they have two collection bins there, and they're overflowing. And all along the side of them is all,

467
03:05:10,042 --> 03:05:36,080
These have gone from collection bins to garbage dumps now. There's furniture there, there's car seats. I think they've kind of gone a different way. And I know we did receive communication from the mayor's office about something I offered last year about ordinances for the collection bins. So I'm glad to see.

468
03:05:36,080 --> 03:05:57,865
The motion that I made last year has gone up. But again, this is at the school, it looks horrible when you drive by there. There's all rubbish between all of them, and there's road instead of going in and out of there. So if we could have that taken care of, I'd appreciate it. Thank you, Vice President Caviello. Councilmate. Mr. President, I second the motion. Okay.

469
03:05:58,692 --> 03:06:25,118
Any questions from the council any questions in general? Okay on the emotion of vice-president cabio seconded by a council and I correct her to be please call the roll That's a bears. Yes vice-president care of y'all Thank You council night yes, that's a marks Council Morrell. Yes, that's a star pellet. Yes, I

470
03:06:25,540 --> 03:06:42,044
President Falco. Yes. Sending the affirmative, zeroing the negative, the motion passes. 20-534 offered by Councilor Behrs. Whereas the new Ball Square MBTA Green Line is designed as a walkable transit station for the South Memphis neighborhood. And whereas pedestrian safety and infrastructure conditions.

471
03:06:42,044 --> 03:07:10,327
require improvements to support the transit-oriented mixed-use development in multimodal reality of the new station. Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the representatives of the Office of Community Development, Community Development Board, Greenline Extension Project, Building Commissioner, and South Medford residents together meet with the City Council and Committee of the Whole to discuss a district plan for the Ball Square-Foster Avenue corridor.

472
03:07:10,529 --> 03:07:26,476
Councilor Behrs. Thank you, Mr. President. So as we're aware, the Green Line Extension Project is well underway, nearing completion, hopefully next year if all targets are met. The stations in Medford, the Ball Square station is actually mostly in Medford, and of course the

473
03:07:26,982 --> 03:07:50,911
Hillside or the Tufts station, I believe Medford Tufts is what it's called, you know, they are walkable stations. There is not parking designated for those stations. So they are designed to be walked to and use other modes of transportation like buses and bikes. The intent of this resolution is after speaking to some folks in the area and also some

474
03:07:51,063 --> 03:08:08,444
developments with development in the area, really taking a hard look at making a district plan for the region along Boston Ave near Ball Square. Obviously, Somerville has just gone through a major rezoning that's going to significantly affect traffic into Medford. So the proposal here is that we would meet in Committee of the Whole.

475
03:08:08,748 --> 03:08:30,348
to discuss a district plan that would include transportation improvements, zoning, all the things that would need to go into really updating what we do in that area. One part of the Green Line extension is that around these walkable stations, the MBTA is really supposed to work with the local authorities, with the municipality.

476
03:08:30,348 --> 03:08:56,521
to make significant improvements around the stations. I think we want to do that as part of a coherent plan, addressing concerns of neighbors, as well as addressing, you know, kind of some of the new opportunities we might have around growth, around development, around improving the area. So again, that's the intent here, meeting committee of the whole with representatives who have a stake in this, and I move approval. Thank you, Council Members.

477
03:08:58,732 --> 03:09:25,040
On the motion, any questions? Oh, we have a question. Oh, we actually, let's see, Laurel Ruma. Okay. Thank you so much. I would please ask that the resolution be changed to include the station stops of Medford-Tufts. Medford does have two Greenline stations here in Medford, which is a fantastic part of the Greenline extension. Ball Square in South Medford, and then Medford-Tufts at College and Boston Avenue.

478
03:09:25,040 --> 03:09:54,065
this project is that people will come from at least a mile radius to the station. And again, because there's no parking at the train station, people will be walking and riding bikes. So just like to make sure the resolution actually includes both of the train stations. Thank you. Thank you. One last thing. Yes. We're on budget and on time to have the trains running by December 2021. So we're a year away. Almost there.

479
03:09:54,503 --> 03:10:17,116
Awesome. Thank you, Laurel, and I'd be happy to amend the paper to add the, you know, Medford-Tufts station and to look at all the way down to Boston Ave to the Medford-Tufts station. So you want to amend it? Yeah. Okay. Yes, let's see. Counselor Knight. Can we invite Tufts University to the meeting as well? Yes. Given the circumstances, yeah, that makes sense.

480
03:10:23,562 --> 03:10:53,060
OK, so we'll see you on the motion of Councilor Behrs, seconded by Councilor Morrell, as amended by Councilors Behrs and Councilor Night. On that motion, Clerk Hurnabys, please call the roll. Councilor Behrs. Yes. Vice President Caravaglia. Yes. Councilor Night. Yes. Councilor Marks. Yes. Councilor Morrell. Yes.

481
03:10:54,410 --> 03:11:20,161
Councilor Scarpelli? Yes. President Falco? Yes. Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative. The motion passes. 2-0-535 offered by Council of Bears be it resolved that President Falco meet with the Board of Health to define what public health metrics will be used to determine the ability of the council to meet in council chambers or if the council must meet in a virtual setting and how often they will be considered.

482
03:11:20,600 --> 03:11:49,287
Be it further resolved that President Falco meet with the Board of Health to define what conditions and public health measures will be used to determine whether members of the public can attend meetings in council chambers. Be it further resolved that President Falco and the Board of Health work with the city solicitor to ensure compliance with state law regulations and emergency orders. Councilor Behrs. Thank you, Mr. President. Yeah, I think this issue has come up a lot from a lot of folks, including myself.

483
03:11:49,456 --> 03:12:08,643
And it goes back to something that was said earlier around having options. We have options around these meetings. I think we've added another option, which is not without its flaws in this meeting hybrid that we're having right now, which has its own issues as well as Zoom. But I think the views of

484
03:12:08,761 --> 03:12:37,043
What public health says, we have not chosen the safest option. We have not chosen the option to meet virtually, not meet in person, which would be the safest option. So I'd like to have some public health metrics and guidance around this beyond just let's meet in the chamber. We can't have the public here. We can't have any of our guests here. Let me tell you, sitting over here between four different barriers trying to look at this TV screen and see what people are saying is, you know,

485
03:12:37,043 --> 03:13:06,254
not the easiest thing in the world when my glasses are fogged up because I'm wearing my mask. So there's benefits and costs to all of the models that we've looked at so far with Zoom and the hybrid model. I think given that fact that neither is perfect, we should be taking the safest choice. So that's what my resolution is intended to do. And quite frankly, I've received several messages tonight asking why some counselors are wearing masks and others aren't. So I would also propose a B paper

486
03:13:06,254 --> 03:13:31,297
that the Council President mandate masks behind the rail while we're meeting. That's not how this works. Mr. President. Okay, thank you Councilor Knight.

487
03:13:33,102 --> 03:14:00,524
We have Councilor Morrell and then Councilor Scott Kelly, I'm sorry. I got the names mixed up on the screen, so. Thank you, Mr. President. I want to thank Councilor Behrs for bringing this forth, because it is a reminder that it's not just us in here. It's our families. It's everyone we interact with in those essential activities. So any time you bring together X number of people, you increase the rate of potential transmission. So I think it's just important to note, it's not just us. It's everyone we interact with in the community. And it's a public health issue. Thank you.

488
03:14:00,693 --> 03:14:28,790
Thank you, Councilor Morrell. Councilor Scarpelli. Councilor Falco, to keep things positive, we are in a chambers where we are protected by glass, with an open seat, where I am at least 8 to 10 feet away from Councilor Knight. I'm 15 feet away from Councilor Morrell. There's nobody else around me. No one else around me.

489
03:14:29,887 --> 03:14:40,619
There's PPE equipment all over the room that we can use. CDC guidelines has me run camps every day with up to 50 kids.

490
03:14:41,952 --> 03:15:08,463
using these schematics, these guidelines, to say that this is any way dangerous because the ruling of social media again spewing negativity is a shame. Stay positive. We agree with Councilor Beas with having the opportunity to have many options that people need.

491
03:15:08,463 --> 03:15:33,792
But what he seems to return over and over again, that there are people that don't do Zoom. So even if there's people scattered out here, six feet apart, and even if it's the five people that can't make these meetings, this is the reason why we had the issue months ago at the budget meetings. Cuz people have an option to come to these chambers.

492
03:15:34,282 --> 03:16:01,450
I am positive that I do not want to be COVID positive. Thank you. Hypocrisy is amazing, but going forward, going forward, this is, this is, this is the city's forum. So like I said, I appreciate my fellow council talking about having people have the opinion to stay healthy and choosing zoom. I understand that.

493
03:16:02,294 --> 03:16:29,885
Whether I like it or not, I understand it, and I support it. But at the same time, if it's one, or two, or three, or five, or 25 people that want to come to this forum because they won't do this Zoom, they have an opportunity too. So I look forward to sitting with the Board of Health. I appreciate that. I welcome that. I'll vote in support of that 1,000%, because I want to hear the Board of Health person, the board members, going to tell me that you're going to allow 400 people in a school

494
03:16:30,880 --> 03:17:00,800
But you're not going to lock people here. People voted here. People volunteered here with no fear. No fear at all. Hypocrisy is amazing. Thank you, Mr. President. Point of information, Mr. President. Point of information, Mr. President. Yeah, I mean, that's a false equivalence. Those are not the same things. We've been sitting and, yeah, it is. I mean, we can talk about it or not, but you can't compare two entirely different things and say they're the same thing and then call someone a hypocrite. It's just not true, Counselor Scarpelli.

495
03:17:00,800 --> 03:17:30,331
And if we want to talk about how this virus spreads, it's a lot of people sitting in this, do you think this glass is protecting anyone in a long term when airborne particles and droplets are spreading? I mean, it's just not based in the science around how this spreads. And quite frankly, I'm the youngest one here. I'm wearing a mask. If you wear a mask, it's to protect other people. I'm at the least risk here. So I'm just saying, I don't think we want to be in a situation where there are counselors who are sick and God forbid there's four counselors who are sick. And I understand that, you know,

496
03:17:30,331 --> 03:17:40,456
Other people may feel differently. I don't think this is a time for feelings. I think this is a time for science and public health. We have Councilor Morrell and then Councilor Marks.

497
03:17:41,063 --> 03:18:07,456
Councilor Morrell. Thank you, Mr. President. I mean, this is really an innocuous, ironically, an innocuous resolution. And I think there is, you know, the research and studies are still coming out, to Councilor Behr's point, about how this transmits. Sure, these, you know, you look at any spray, this actually doesn't do anything. And we're sitting in recirculated air, so we can't sit here and say, we just had long conversations about the air quality in the high school, and then it's,

498
03:18:07,979 --> 03:18:21,395
I'm at a loss for words here, because again, this is a very innocuous, have a conversation, look at some metrics, how do we move forward, resolution, and it shouldn't inspire this level of ire and anger and finger pointing.

499
03:18:22,137 --> 03:18:51,736
Point of information, Mr. President. Point of information, Mr. President. Point of information, thank you, Councilor Morrell. Point of information, Councilor Scott-Pelley. The intent of the resolution was fine, but to respond that people and social media responding to our fellow colleagues and saying even that I'm masked, that's a joke, that's hypocrisy. Thank you. Thank you, Councilor Scott-Pelley. Councilor Marks. Mr. President. It is on now. One second.

500
03:18:53,761 --> 03:19:16,424
Mr. President, did you not meet or was the Board of Health Director not in this chamber and gave approval to this set up, Mr. President? Yes, correct, correct. So if I may really quickly- Mr. President, if I could. Can you not go to a restaurant, indoor or outdoor, and sit six feet from someone else without plexiglass, Mr. President?

501
03:19:17,943 --> 03:19:39,442
Have we not been told, Mr. President, that we can't exceed 25 people in this chamber, Mr. President? Correct. Do we exceed those numbers, Mr. President? Have we adhered to all the rules and regulations, Mr. President? If my colleague wants to stick his head in the sand, but meanwhile attend every rally possible,

502
03:19:39,442 --> 03:20:03,809
Everywhere, we've got hundreds of people gliding in and shaking hands. Then so be it, Mr. President. It is the height of hypocrisy, Mr. President, to stand there and say that someone would be in danger attending this meeting, Mr. President. Shame on whoever's spreading that around, Mr. President. Yeah, Mr. President. Thank you, Counselor Marks. Counselor Knight, and then Counselor Behrs. Counselor Knight.

503
03:20:06,222 --> 03:20:30,505
Mr. President, I just want to say this. Now, we've been doing this Zoom thing now for what, since St. Patty's Day? Yes. All right, so that's going back to March 16th. March 17th, we've been doing the Zoom. Almost six months. I don't like Zoom at all. I think it's awful. I have a terrible setup for it in my home. I got two young kids. I can't put them on lockdown for seven and eight and nine hour long meetings and tell them, don't say a word in the house, guys. I got a Zoom meeting going on. All right, it doesn't work for me.

504
03:20:30,505 --> 03:20:56,628
But I will say this, and I don't think anybody can shake a stick at it. The last two meetings that we've had in this chambers have been the best run meetings that we've had since St. Patrick's Day. And I'll be happy to say that, Mr. President. The reason why is because we're in these chambers and we're doing business where business is supposed to be done. And that's why when the governor issued his executive order, bodies public were exempt. Thank you, Councilor Knight.

505
03:21:00,374 --> 03:21:23,189
So just to let everyone know, you know, before we, Councilor Pierce. Thank you, Mr. President. I believe when you walk in the building, it says you have to keep your mask on. So again, you know, if we're talking about following all rules and regulations, that's fine. That's not what this resolution says. It says, I'd like to check on that. It says that we should have not, not that the process that has gone through approval now,

506
03:21:23,189 --> 03:21:43,895
is at issue here, Counselor Marks, through the Chair, it's that if things change, do we need to make a different decision and how are we having the information to make that choice? That's what it's saying. I'll be completely honest. The reason I proposed a B paper is because I've been wearing my mask this whole time and showing you the courtesy of doing that and I would like that to be returned to me. And if it's not, then I will attend in a way that makes me feel safe.

507
03:21:43,895 --> 03:22:10,692
You know, if my counselors don't want to do that, or they don't feel that wearing a mask is necessary, that's fine with them. I'm going to make a decision to make myself feel safe. I think that to Counselor Knight's point, to the integrity of the body, do we want President Falco trying to call on me on Zoom and call on you in here? It's already hard enough with the two of us in these back seats without a signal. So I ask for that reason, that everyone wear a mask, and I'll feel okay being in here. But to say that it's not everywhere we go, I don't go to restaurants.

508
03:22:11,671 --> 03:22:23,939
Well, then maybe we should meet on Zoom. Then maybe we should meet on Zoom. I don't know what to say, Council Marks. I can understand it. I think the public can understand it.

509
03:22:24,125 --> 03:22:43,193
Thank you, Mr. President. And again, I would ask that my colleagues respect the courtesy and the rules of the building and wear their masks. And if they don't, then we'll have to make the choices we make. And I guarantee you, it won't be as an effectively run meeting if some of the council are here and some of the council is not. So that's why I proposed the B paper. And quite frankly, I'm disappointed.

510
03:22:44,763 --> 03:23:06,869
Okay, thank you, Councilor Behrs. We have Councilor Morrell. Thank you, Mr. President. I continue to be dismayed by the health decisions trying to be made by other people. You do not know people's medical histories, their underlying conditions, their level of safety in being here. And I'm just so dismayed by other people trying to make health decisions for people this entire time.

511
03:23:08,472 --> 03:23:31,777
I was only here for an hour until a fellow counselor asked that I be removed. I've been here for what, six and a half hours? Because there is no safe option. There is a safe option for these council meetings. There is a safe option for these council meetings.

512
03:23:31,777 --> 03:23:48,112
There's not a safe option. There's not another option for people to vote. And I stand by my decision to protect democracy. Thank you. And you also endorsed candidates that you were passing off ballots to. Point of information, Mr. President. That's enough, okay? That's enough.

513
03:23:48,550 --> 03:24:04,025
Okay. Point of information. We've debated this, I think everyone's had three times by now. What I want to say is this, and I'll be the final word on this, and that is that I have met with

514
03:24:04,818 --> 03:24:30,367
We've gone back and forth all over the phone with Marian O'Connor, with Kimberly Scanlon, and we're doing everything that we should be doing, okay? I have made sure of that, okay? So what I will be doing now, and I'll tell you this much, is I will be meeting with them again because maybe we'll have a committee in the hall about it. That's what we need to do. But I mean, I have gone.

515
03:24:30,367 --> 03:24:46,735
spent a ton of time going back and forth with each of the department heads, making sure that plexiglass goes up, making sure that everybody's seated in the right spot, working with Patrick Gordon to do all the technology piece. This has not been an easy task, but

516
03:24:46,735 --> 03:25:16,047
If I go back at the past meetings, everybody was pretty much on board with getting back in chambers. So what we have been doing is we've basically been following the rules that have been put in place. So with that being said, to get us all on the same page, we can meet with our department heads again. But to tell you the truth, there are some cities and towns that are meeting, actually, and having the public here as well. Now, I've been told by our city solicitor that we can't do that.

517
03:25:17,498 --> 03:25:20,350
Okay, the room.

518
03:25:20,890 --> 03:25:48,008
I do have that, and I can send that to you. But with that being said, the opinion was that the room's got 25 people in it. If 30 people show up to the meeting, we can't kick people out of the room. And therefore, we would be limiting speech and be limiting participation. So it would be a violation of the open meeting law. And that's why we're here tonight, and the public is coming in through Zoom. That is the reason I got from the city solicitor.

519
03:25:48,008 --> 03:26:08,326
So with that being said, that's where we are with that, okay? So we have a number of people that want to ask questions on this. I will call on that now. William Navar, name and address for the record, please. You have a minute and a half. Thank you, President Falco. William Navar, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

520
03:26:08,900 --> 03:26:24,914
I'm quite disappointed with the vitriol on both sides of this issue. And I wish we could take a problem-solving stance. And I've seen different city councils do this in different ways, et cetera. But just as a matter of practicality,

521
03:26:24,914 --> 03:26:53,922
I think there's probably a way to meet safely and perhaps a safe mess or not, I'm not sure. But just as I see on my screen, you can't actually see the counselors. I can see you, President Falcone. I can see Claire Curnaby, but the other counselors I can't actually see, which is actually sort of worse than when everybody's at home. And also nobody's in the chamber, so it doesn't really provide access for people who can't do Zoom.

522
03:26:53,922 --> 03:27:23,302
But mostly, I just hope we can get back into a problem-solving, problem-solving kind of thing, rather than this material is pretty frustrating to me. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you. We'll see. We have Jean Nuzzo. Name and address for the record, please. Hi. Thank you. Jean Nuzzo, 35 Paris Street. Give a minute and a half. Just a few quick thoughts. First of all, you're in a space with 20-foot ceilings. You're distance beyond 10 feet.

523
03:27:23,723 --> 03:27:48,091
and a room that typically holds between 200 and 250 people, you're currently at between two and two and a half percent capacity. As for public participation, City Hall is quite large. You could do an inbound pathway and an outbound pathway with some staged areas, six foot distancing dots and monitors in the hallway, and citizens and residents of Medford

524
03:27:48,091 --> 03:28:17,133
and speak in front of that chamber. And if you need some help, let me know. I've done a million square feet of this at this point. So again, I applaud you being on site. I recognize that people are concerned about masks, but right now in this moment, you're roughly at 2% occupancy, which is lower than what's required. Thank you for letting me speak. And again, if you need my help, let me know. Thank you very much. Okay, up next we have Joanna.

525
03:28:17,555 --> 03:28:46,867
I'm sorry if I'm saying that wrong. Yes, name and address for the record, please. Can you have a minute? I just think that yeah, I whatever you whatever the decisions were made to me in chambers is one thing. But during a global pandemic, you can't tell anybody individually what they shouldn't, should not do or what they're comfortable with.

526
03:28:47,626 --> 03:29:13,867
As far as the other counselors, yelling and screaming at other counselors, it's so ridiculous. And President Falco, it's not your fault, but I would take better control of that room, because it wouldn't be happening, not on my watch. It's not right. They shouldn't be doing it to each other. Thank you. Thank you. Rick Caparo, name and address for the record, please.

527
03:29:16,043 --> 03:29:45,592
I would just like to let Councilor Morrell and Councilor Bares, if they're so concerned about everyone's health and everyone in the council in the room, then they would be very concerned about the children they plan on having at a rally on Saturday. So they should stop being hypocrites and respect the city. Thank you. Thank you. Point of information, Councilor Morrell. One second. Councilor Morrell, one second.

528
03:29:46,199 --> 03:30:06,179
Put your microphone on. Through the chair, I'm not having a rally on Saturday. I just want to make that clear. Thank you. Thank you, Councilor Morrell. Let's see, we have Laurel Rummel. Laurel, name and address of the record, Laurel. Oops, sorry. Trying to unmute you. Laurel Rummel, 149 Burgett Avenue.

529
03:30:06,668 --> 03:30:34,664
So it's very disrespectful the way that everyone is acting, and I think you all know better, and to have counselors shout over each other and call each other names is outrageous. You're there as all representatives. I understand this is a heated debate, but everyone has to do the best practices possible to keep everyone else safe. It's just very disappointing and ridiculous that we've come to this.

530
03:30:35,187 --> 03:30:57,867
Two, the Zoom meetings are fantastic. More than 100 people are online. Probably 10 people are watching through the feed. We need to kind of keep this participation and interest and people just being exposed to how the city does business going. And I have to tell you, you've got to be more welcoming than shouting and arguing this constantly.

531
03:30:58,222 --> 03:31:27,297
Lastly, I'm not sure what the devil in the room is with the social media and the negativity. All I'm seeing on social media is a lot of people trying to figure out how to make Medford the best place it can be for as many people as possible. And, you know, everyone is quite heated right now. But let's just kind of step back a minute and take a breath. And I really appreciate that we're not calling each other hypocrites. Thank you.

532
03:31:28,158 --> 03:31:54,095
Thank you. Okay, I believe that is everyone. Okay, so on the B paper offered by Councilor Beers, on that B paper, that was seconded by, does that have a second, Councilor Morrell? Okay, on the B paper. Clerk, could you please read the B paper back? I believe the B paper was to have the Council President

533
03:31:55,293 --> 03:32:23,947
Mandate masks behind the rail during council meetings. Is that correct council bears? Correct. Mr. Clark That is correct amend the paper to amend the council rules to mandate masks behind the rail

534
03:32:24,250 --> 03:32:39,775
for the duration of the COVID-19 state of emergency. We want to amend the paper. Amend the council rules. Do you have the language on that paper? I'm trying.

535
03:32:57,427 --> 03:33:25,017
All right, let me read this back. So the B paper is to amend the council rules to mandate masks behind the rail during council meetings for the duration of the COVID-19 emergency. Yes, as issued by Governor Baker. What was the last part? The COVID-19 state of emergency as issued by Governor Baker. Okay. Did I clear everybody? Got it.

536
03:33:28,358 --> 03:33:56,793
Councilor Beers made a motion and Councilor Knight has asked that that be moved to the Rules Subcommittee, where that can be discussed. Because to be honest with you, Councilor Beers, I don't even know if I have the authority to do that. I mean, I can't tell. So I think it probably needs to be discussed. So on a motion of Councilor Knight to move that to the Rules Subcommittee, was there a second there?

537
03:33:58,177 --> 03:34:27,505
Seconded by Councilor Scott Kelly. Clerk Urtubis, please call the roll. This is to move it to the Rules Subcommittee? Yes. Councilor Behrs? Yes. Vice President Caraballo? Yes. Vice President Caraballo? Yes. That was a yes. OK. Councilor Night? No. I can't hear Councilor Night either. No. He said no.

538
03:34:29,598 --> 03:34:55,619
And that's a no. Correct.

539
03:34:56,058 --> 03:35:25,167
Four in the affirmative, three in the negative. The B paper has been moved to the Rules Subcommittee. On the main motion offered by Councilor Behrs, and that was seconded by, was there a second on that? Second. Seconded by Councilor Morrell. Clerk Urtubis, please call the roll. On the main paper, Councilor Behrs. Yes.

540
03:35:26,315 --> 03:35:54,985
Vice President Caraballo. Yes. Vice President Caraballo. Yes. Yes. Councilor Knight. No. Councilor Marks. No. Councilor Morrell. Yes. Councilor Scarpelli. No.

541
03:35:57,820 --> 03:36:26,440
Yes, 4 in the affirmative, 3 in the negative, the motion passes. Okay. Mr. President, when do you plan on meeting with the Board of Health? We'll see, I've got to find time. We'll figure it out. I have to meet with Mary Ann and Kim Scanlon sooner than later. I talked to them today. We will be setting up some time and we can

542
03:36:26,609 --> 03:36:55,499
work on that issue as well, so. So you'd be meeting with just the Board of Health and the solicitor yourself behind closed doors and then coming up with a plan? No, I just talked to them today and I told them I wanted to speak to them more about what we're doing here and how we're doing it. Just want to make sure everybody's on the same page. Because where it's, as a result of a council resolution, you might want to be careful meeting behind closed doors. Absolutely, so that's fine, we can do that. Thank you.

543
03:36:56,258 --> 03:37:17,808
20-537 offered by Council of Mayors, whereas residents of Meffitt requested that the city of Meffitt hang a banner stating Black Lives Matter at Meffitt City Hall as a statement of solidarity and support to begin to address the history of racism and discrimination in our community. And whereas the Supreme Court of the United States and Rosenberger versus Rectors and Visitors of University of Virginia established

544
03:37:17,808 --> 03:37:35,999
The government speech doctrine recognizing that a government entity is entitled to say what it wishes and select views it wants to express. And whereas the government speech doctrine has been affirmed and reinforced by Supreme Court decisions including but not limited to Russ versus Sullivan, Johans versus Livestock.

545
03:37:36,353 --> 03:37:56,705
Marketing Association, Pleasant Grove City v. Summum, Walker v. Texas Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans and Matal v. TAM, and whereas placing a banner on Memphis City Hall meets the multi-factor test defined in Summum and Walker of, number one, historic use of building

546
03:37:56,705 --> 03:38:22,270
including banners to convey government messages, two, the public's close identification of messages and signage placed on Medford City Hall with the city government, and three, the city of Medford's maintenance of effective control over the messages conveyed, and whereas in 2018 the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts in Shirtland versus the City of Boston denied the request for injunction

547
03:38:22,270 --> 03:38:48,950
of a plaintiff requesting the flying of a specific flag on Boston City Hall using the government speech doctrine and multi-factor test defined in Summum and Walker. And whereas in 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed the decision of District Court of Shurtleff with a three-judge panel deciding unanimously to reject the plaintiff's appeal. Now, therefore,

548
03:38:50,333 --> 03:39:14,903
Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council, that the city administration provide a summary explanation of the opinion regarding banners on Memphis City Hall and how it is possible that such an opinion can ignore the U.S. Constitution's government speech doctrine as decided and affirmed by decades of precedent of the Supreme Court of the United States. Councilor Beers.

549
03:39:16,253 --> 03:39:29,652
So this same resolution has been offered two weeks in a row. So when the council rules, I have to rule this out of order because it has been two weeks in a row. This is verbatim, the same exact resolution as a prior meeting.

550
03:39:30,462 --> 03:39:48,890
Now, so with that being said, the matter basically has already been disposed of because I was ruled out of order in the previous week. There was a doubting of the chair. But with that being said, what I did do today is I made a phone call to Chief of Staff Rodriguez.

551
03:39:49,075 --> 03:40:06,828
And he was busy all day meeting, so I did have a conversation with the mayor regarding this very issue. So what I wanted to let you know is during our conversation, what she said is the response is on the way, and that the council should receive it within the next few days.

552
03:40:07,486 --> 03:40:36,595
She also went out to say that the administration is also working on a policy with regard to banners. There's no timeline on that, but there is a policy that they are working on. But she said that we will be getting a response, because we haven't received an official response. But we will be getting that in the next few days, okay? Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you. 20-53, an offer by Councilor- Can I ask why it's taking a month?

553
03:40:38,654 --> 03:40:58,094
What's coronavirus? Mr. President, the paper's out of order. Yeah. Yeah, the paper's out of order. I do not know why the administration's taking as long as it's taking, but that is what I was told and I wanted to pass that information on to my colleagues. I think a month is

554
03:40:59,343 --> 03:41:23,474
I would agree, but you know. 20-53, an offer by Councilor Morrell, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council request that a representative from the administration provide an update on COVID-19 metrics for Memphis in any policy changes related to the pandemic at each forthcoming regular City Council meeting so long as deemed necessary to city operations. Councilor Morrell? Give me one second.

555
03:41:27,136 --> 03:41:53,275
Councilor Morrell. Thank you, Mr. President. Yeah, this is pretty self-explanatory. I've had a few residents reach out about this. I know we have the dashboard. The dashboard is beautiful, but it does seem like there's a real opportunity at City Council meetings to hear from the administration, just a brief update about perhaps any changes, any different metrics, or how things are impacting things because I know we have, you know, it's seemingly every day that state unveils some new color map and what it means and, you know, the goalposts keep on moving.

556
03:41:53,275 --> 03:42:21,187
and changing so I think it would just be an opportune thing to have a representative from the administration just explain kind of where we are and any necessary updates. So I move approval. Thank you. Second. On the motion of Councilor Morrell. On the motion of Councilor Morrell, seconded by Councilor Beers, Councilor Knight. From an operational standpoint, through you, through the author of the amendment, so does this feel like a standing

557
03:42:21,878 --> 03:42:51,730
COVID-19 updated every single council meeting by someone from the administration? I mean, I'm just concerned about posting, you know, I mean, we've talked about suspension of the rules. We've talked about how we're not bringing items under suspension of the rules. We have posting requirements through the open meeting law. So would this be like a standing invitation? Is it the first meeting of every month? Is it whenever the administration feels fit or is this gonna be one of those things where every month we say, okay, is anybody here from the administration that wants to come and give us an update on Corona? Okay, no, all right, moving on.

558
03:42:53,080 --> 03:43:12,773
Yeah, I mean, I have the same question procedurally. My intention was just to get a response from the administration first and then understand how it might be introduced by them if it's something they're willing to do. I understand it's, yeah, procedurally it's something strange, but it's strange times. Mr. President, point of information.

559
03:43:13,229 --> 03:43:40,634
Point of information, council appears. I mean, it could be a weekly communication from the mayor that ends up on the agenda, something like that. I'm interested to hear what the administration has to say. It could be that. That says one or two. Like, could it be like a report for marrying an honor? Yeah. Yeah. That's, yeah. I would ideally, yeah. Putting this to the administration, seeing how they would like to deliver it via communications from the mayor, communications from the administration. That could be added if they see fit, if it's something they agree to.

560
03:43:41,866 --> 03:44:06,436
So it wouldn't be that they're necessarily appearing before the council and are on the agenda. The request would be that they give us a weekly report as to the status. I mean, my intention would be to have someone to actually speak from the administration because there is stuff online. There is stuff already in report form and this would just be kind of anything that's worth addressing that week, that needs to be addressed that week. Under council purview or just in general?

561
03:44:07,516 --> 03:44:34,330
I see it in general as this being, you know, we have X number of people on the call right now, it just being that these are well attended and as opposed to having to hunt stuff down on the website and try to parse out data, just getting an update to say, okay, here's the numbers and here's how it impacts anything, or maybe it doesn't, or maybe there's not an update that week. Maybe it's not possible procedurally, but I think it is, it's information that's being asked for in the community and it's, this is a vehicle to provide it.

562
03:44:39,325 --> 03:44:54,580
Councilor Caviello. Vice President Caviello. Councilor, I didn't, I couldn't understand what you were saying because I am hearing impaired and I just, if you could repeat what you started with, I just, I just couldn't, I couldn't understand what you said.

563
03:44:54,800 --> 03:45:24,517
I'm just hoping because we do have the dashboard and there are numbers there, but sometimes it's a certain amount of parsing out and trying to understand, you know, looking at one screen and seeing what the state metrics say and how we're supposed to behave based on those numbers. And if we could get an update directly from the administration as far as our metrics and if it's changing any policies that week. But I do understand it's procedurally as far as being introduced as an agenda item, it's a little bit tricky. So my intention is just to deliver this to administration and get a response from them as far as how they might

564
03:45:24,517 --> 03:45:52,259
if they would be interested in delivering such a thing and how they might want to deliver it, whether it's communications from the mayor or something like that. But I do think there is a benefit to having a representative from the administration when possible to briefly address this. So this would be on a weekly basis or a monthly basis? I mean, weekly would be nice, but I think I also, I'd be happy to amend the paper to have the administration at a frequency they deem necessary.

565
03:45:58,317 --> 03:46:27,342
Thank you. Is that an amendment? Yeah. If we could add the language at a frequency that the administration deems necessary in the form of an amendment. So we're going to strike the language at each forthcoming regular council meeting? Yes. You can strike that language. We can strike that language. I'll second that amendment, Mr. President. Any other questions for the council? Any other questions? Okay. Seeing and hearing none.

566
03:46:27,798 --> 03:46:57,599

568

569
03:47:34,589 --> 03:48:02,905
and members of the city council, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve the following amendments to the city of Medford revised ordinances entitled historic district commission, article three, section 48 through 51 as described below. The amendments clarify the ordinance to delineate the previously approved districts and at the request of the method historic district commission create new single parcel district at 16 Foster court.

570
03:48:02,905 --> 03:48:22,514
By way of background, section 48-51A presently states, under the authority of Mass General MGLA C40 section 3, there is a hereby established Hillside Avenue Historic District and Marm Simmons Historic District.

571
03:48:22,514 --> 03:48:36,824
bounded as respectively shown on the map entitled Historic Avenue Historic District in Marm-Simons Historic District, which are on file in the city clerk's office and made part of this article by reference.

572
03:48:38,343 --> 03:49:07,874
Pursuant to Mass General Law, Chapter 40C, Section 3, the attached report and request has been transmitted to the Community Development Board for their concurrent review. The matter is scheduled to be taken up by the Community Development Board on September 16th, 2020. Thank you for your kind attention to this matter. Sincerely, Brianna Longo Kern, Mayor. Mr. President, motion to refer to a committee of the whole for a presentation by the Historic District Commission, the owner of the property, before the City Council.

573
03:49:07,908 --> 03:49:36,545
On the motion, I'm counseling tonight to refer to Committee of the Whole for a presentation from the owner of the property. Is that OK? Yes. From the Historic District Commission, I think, would be the ones that are imposing this, presenting this. So the Historic District Commission can present it. We'll have the owner of the property there, as well as a representative from the mayor's office, Mr. President. Today, I had the opportunity to speak with Mayor Lungo on a number of issues. And this topic came up. And she suggested that we meet in the Committee of the Whole, and she'll have a representative from her staff available.

574
03:49:36,545 --> 03:49:53,386
To sit down with us and go over the paper as well as representatives from the Historic District Commission there, okay? Mr.. President well on the motion of console night seconded by Council Scott Pelley we have console morel. I believe had her hand up yep console morel and that consoles bears and

575
03:49:54,432 --> 03:50:20,504
So the motion was to refer to committee, the whole seconded by Councilor Scott, followed by Councilor Morrell. Thank you, Mr. President. I'm curious if we could amend that to add to a date certain, because this demo delay expires in October. So we would probably want to meet before the expiration to actually have this conversation. So make sure we do that in due time. And on to that point, Mr. President, I spoke with the mayor and she said that she would make someone available next week. She said she'd be willing to do that, but it would have to happen next week. If I may, we actually do have

576
03:50:21,567 --> 03:50:50,052
You can blow up my meeting. You're taking it Wednesday, right? It's OK. I understand. This is timely. So it'll be either Tuesday or Wednesday next week, OK? Just to let everyone know. So we'll get it scheduled sooner than later. OK, so Councilor Morrell has amended the paper. Councilor Beers? Yeah, that was the same thing. So if it's happening next week, I'm fine with that. OK, thank you, Councilor Beers. Any other questions or comments from the council? Mr. President?

577
03:50:51,318 --> 03:51:19,482
Quick question, so Councilor Morrell is offering an amendment to a date certain, is that correct? Well, I think, I don't formally have a date yet, so I'm aiming for next Tuesday or Wednesday. No less than 10 days. No less than 10, within 10 days, right? We'll meet within 10 days.

578
03:51:26,840 --> 03:51:52,912
Okay. Let's see, so, Councilor Morrell, did you have another? No, I just had, okay, speak on that. Okay, so I'll thank you. Okay, perfect. Okay, so. So there's no amendment, is that correct? Is the amendment to meet within 10 days? Yeah, the amendment is to meet. I'll second that amendment, Mr. President. To meet within 10 days. You are correct. Okay, let's see, so,

579
03:51:53,975 --> 03:52:22,848

580
03:52:24,400 --> 03:52:50,219
We're running out of time here. And this is a historic house that should be preserved. And I just want to be sure that bureaucratic people made a lot of comments about how slow everything moves with historic district commissions and the historical commission and so on. But this is exactly the same thing. OK. Thank you, Chris.

581
03:52:53,999 --> 03:53:20,375
Okay, any other questions? Okay, hearing and seeing none. Oh, I'm sorry, we've got Jean Nozo has her hand up. Jean, I'm unmuting you now. Jean, name and address for the record, please. Jean?

583
03:53:58,208 --> 03:54:27,183
I just, I think I just unmuted Jean. Okay. Jean, name and address for the record, please. Mr. Clerk, I have, she's unmuted. Jean? Alright. Okay. Mueller?

584
03:54:30,642 --> 03:54:54,082

587
03:55:50,849 --> 03:56:20,363
Mr. President, did you ask me a question? Yes, do you know if Mohammed Anwar was logging in, or if you've seen him? I didn't see him logged in. OK. I don't see him either. So that will stay on the table. Clerk Carterby, did we dispose of everything? I think you have records of public participation.

588
03:56:24,565 --> 03:56:51,008
Let's see, public participation, did anybody want to speak? Dude, this is like a cast iron pot pan. It's gorgeous. Okay, let's see. Thank you, Laurel. Okay, it looks like, okay, so we don't have anything on community participation that I can see.
