[SPEAKER_26]: Sincerely, Brianna Longo Kern, Mayor.

61
00:04:08,286 --> 00:04:14,649
[SPEAKER_26]: Let's see, we had, let's see, I believe Councilor Knight wanted to speak on that.

62
00:04:15,109 --> 00:04:15,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight?

63
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:18,210
[SPEAKER_04]: I do believe Councilor Caballero was the moving party taken off the table, Mr. President.

64
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:21,398
[SPEAKER_27]: My apologies, Vice President Caviello.

65
00:04:21,979 --> 00:04:22,459
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, Mr. President.

66
00:04:22,499 --> 00:04:23,499
[SPEAKER_23]: If we could take that off the table.

67
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,300
[SPEAKER_27]: That paper has been taken from the table.

68
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,301
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, I'm sorry.

69
00:04:28,761 --> 00:04:29,261
[SPEAKER_23]: 20516, also.

70
00:04:29,801 --> 00:04:30,201
[SPEAKER_23]: Second.

71
00:04:31,342 --> 00:04:32,682
[SPEAKER_26]: Do you want to vote on this one first?

72
00:04:33,462 --> 00:04:33,642
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes.

73
00:04:34,403 --> 00:04:34,663
[SPEAKER_26]: OK.

74
00:04:34,723 --> 00:04:36,783
[SPEAKER_26]: So are you making a motion to approve?

75
00:04:36,983 --> 00:04:37,264
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

76
00:04:37,484 --> 00:04:37,804
[SPEAKER_26]: OK.

77
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:40,004
[SPEAKER_26]: On the motion to approve, 20-517.

78
00:04:40,024 --> 00:04:40,545
[SPEAKER_26]: Second.

79
00:04:40,585 --> 00:04:44,946
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. President, Mr. President, is Jonathan available, Mr. President?

80
00:04:46,026 --> 00:04:47,167
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, on the motion of counselor.

81
00:04:48,845 --> 00:04:51,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Is John McLaughlin available, the facilities director?

82
00:04:51,146 --> 00:04:53,008
[SPEAKER_26]: Let's see, is John McLaughlin on the phone?

83
00:04:53,108 --> 00:04:54,568
[SPEAKER_26]: Or actually, is he on the meeting?

84
00:04:59,171 --> 00:05:01,433
[SPEAKER_23]: If he's not on the meeting, we can wait until later on in the meeting.

85
00:05:05,675 --> 00:05:07,856
[SPEAKER_26]: We have our superintendent of schools is with us as well.

86
00:05:08,117 --> 00:05:10,238
[SPEAKER_02]: She's John's boss, so she should probably be.

87
00:05:11,142 --> 00:05:13,244
[SPEAKER_26]: Do you have a question for the superintendent?

88
00:05:13,284 --> 00:05:13,484
[SPEAKER_04]: I do.

89
00:05:13,544 --> 00:05:16,727
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd just like to give us a breakdown as to where funds are going to be expended.

90
00:05:17,467 --> 00:05:18,888
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the reason why we tabled it last week.

91
00:05:19,289 --> 00:05:19,589
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

92
00:05:19,629 --> 00:05:20,490
[SPEAKER_26]: So let's see.

93
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:24,233
[SPEAKER_26]: On the motion of Vice President Caviello, seconded by Councilor Behrs.

94
00:05:24,813 --> 00:05:27,516
[SPEAKER_26]: And we have the superintendent of schools with us.

95
00:05:28,016 --> 00:05:28,597
[SPEAKER_26]: Let's see.

96
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:31,099
[SPEAKER_26]: Dr. Marie Sedgwick-Vincent.

97
00:05:32,495 --> 00:05:32,915
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe.

98
00:05:52,048 --> 00:06:03,314
[SPEAKER_17]: and other members of my team, Dave Murphy, Dr. Peter Cushing, and possibly Suzanne Galussi as well.

99
00:06:03,794 --> 00:06:09,777
[SPEAKER_17]: So we are prepared to respond to any questions that you may have regarding the,

100
00:06:13,227 --> 00:06:25,440
[SPEAKER_17]: the proposals for how we would recommend spending this money to advance work that needs to be done in all of the buildings for a safe opening of schools.

101
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent.

102
00:06:26,441 --> 00:06:26,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

103
00:06:27,842 --> 00:06:28,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Dr. Vincent.

104
00:06:28,743 --> 00:06:29,784
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate you being here.

105
00:06:30,685 --> 00:06:37,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, these funds, this $800 and somewhat thousand dollars, these funds are for capital improvements, correct?

106
00:06:37,812 --> 00:06:39,013
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not for any personnel.

107
00:06:39,313 --> 00:06:42,676
[SPEAKER_04]: They can't bring reading specialists back into the classroom or anything like that, right?

108
00:06:42,716 --> 00:06:44,078
[SPEAKER_04]: These are just for capital expenses?

109
00:06:44,993 --> 00:06:47,935
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, absolutely not for personnel.

110
00:06:48,195 --> 00:07:10,766
[SPEAKER_17]: The request for these funds are to improve our infrastructure, in particular around the areas of air exchange, air quality, to get our buildings up to air balancing, all of those things that are currently working to try to fix to make sure that our buildings

111
00:07:11,366 --> 00:07:14,827
[SPEAKER_17]: are up and running and safe for a smooth reopening of schools.

112
00:07:15,367 --> 00:07:22,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, but so the council's tabling of this item did not prevent the school department from bringing any teachers or any classroom teachers back, is that correct?

113
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:23,830
[SPEAKER_04]: That is correct.

114
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:24,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent, thank you.

115
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:30,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Because sometimes there's a lot of misinformation that travels around the community, and that was something that was going around.

116
00:07:30,732 --> 00:07:33,033
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just wanted to be sure, Dr. Vincent, that we were all clear.

117
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:37,815
[SPEAKER_04]: that the funds here that were tabled by the council at the last meeting were for capital funds only.

118
00:07:38,155 --> 00:07:45,337
[SPEAKER_04]: But the council did last meeting, I believe, increase the school department's budget by $1.08 million that would allow for those positions to be restored.

119
00:07:45,377 --> 00:07:45,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that correct?

120
00:07:46,498 --> 00:07:47,238
[SPEAKER_17]: That is correct.

121
00:07:47,678 --> 00:07:48,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent.

122
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:53,860
[SPEAKER_04]: And after last week's meeting, I did have the opportunity to pick up the phone and make a telephone call to John McLaughlin.

123
00:07:54,281 --> 00:07:58,242
[SPEAKER_04]: And I spoke with John at length and he explained to me the situation at the high school especially.

124
00:07:59,042 --> 00:08:02,744
[SPEAKER_04]: relative to the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system.

125
00:08:03,285 --> 00:08:08,227
[SPEAKER_04]: He also explained to me that there were some air quality tests that were conducted that came back.

126
00:08:08,267 --> 00:08:13,010
[SPEAKER_04]: And for the most part, all of our schools came back with very good reviews, with the exception of one.

127
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:16,291
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we all know what school that is, Medford High School.

128
00:08:16,452 --> 00:08:22,755
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that being said, Dr. Vincent, could you tell us a little bit about the scope of work that you're looking to spend this $800 and some odd thousand dollars on, please?

129
00:08:23,537 --> 00:08:34,826
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, so there is a significant scope of work that does need to be done in particular if we focus on the high school, which is the oldest building in the district outside of the Curtis Tufts.

130
00:08:36,107 --> 00:08:42,012
[SPEAKER_17]: But the high school being 50 years old has older rooms, more eighth graders.

131
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,301
[SPEAKER_17]: some pains, if I can say that.

132
00:08:46,461 --> 00:08:51,484
[SPEAKER_17]: And so there are areas that definitely need immediate attention in the HVAC area.

133
00:08:51,845 --> 00:09:09,114
[SPEAKER_17]: And so we're currently, WB Engineering is currently conducting, completed their first report on the building of the high school and what they would make recommendations for in the area of HVAC.

134
00:09:10,015 --> 00:09:11,236
[SPEAKER_17]: We also have,

135
00:09:12,392 --> 00:09:31,822
[SPEAKER_17]: UEC universal environmentalists coming in who are also looking at air quality and air balancing and we also have Precision, another engineering group that is continuing to look at how our HVAC systems function and work for the district.

136
00:09:32,382 --> 00:09:34,263
[SPEAKER_17]: So with all of the different

137
00:09:36,193 --> 00:09:42,142
[SPEAKER_17]: engineering companies that have been coming in, the cost is truly significant.

138
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:50,333
[SPEAKER_17]: For example, at the high school on the roof, to repair the fans that are on the roof, which are part of the exhaust

139
00:09:51,026 --> 00:09:52,586
[SPEAKER_17]: system, HVAC system.

140
00:09:53,307 --> 00:10:14,952
[SPEAKER_17]: We have approximately $150,000 worth of work on the roof alone, addressing fans and making sure that they are all properly functioning at their maximum speed and able to deliver and support intake and outtake in the building.

141
00:10:16,252 --> 00:10:20,633
[SPEAKER_17]: In addition, from WB Engineering's initial report,

142
00:10:21,394 --> 00:10:26,800
[SPEAKER_17]: on the high school based on the mitigation strategies that they recommended.

143
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:34,570
[SPEAKER_17]: We're talking about prices that would exceed $200,000 at the high school complex alone.

144
00:10:35,311 --> 00:10:39,676
[SPEAKER_17]: And the other off-campus buildings are still being assessed as we speak.

145
00:10:40,297 --> 00:10:46,119
[SPEAKER_17]: and so we are waiting for those reports to finish being completed.

146
00:10:47,419 --> 00:10:50,940
[SPEAKER_17]: Some of that money also because, again, this building is 50 years old.

147
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:57,362
[SPEAKER_17]: Prior to the official ADA changes that newer buildings had to have to be properly

148
00:10:57,962 --> 00:10:59,344
[SPEAKER_17]: handicapped, accessible.

149
00:10:59,844 --> 00:11:09,954
[SPEAKER_17]: We wanted to set aside approximately $50,000 to $100,000 to support making the entrance to the high school ADA compliant.

150
00:11:10,495 --> 00:11:16,641
[SPEAKER_17]: There is a ramp there that vehicles go up and down, but for people in wheelchairs,

151
00:11:18,242 --> 00:11:20,523
[SPEAKER_17]: it is not fully compliant.

152
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:25,466
[SPEAKER_17]: And so those are some of the things that we want to be able to use these monies for.

153
00:11:26,067 --> 00:11:37,194
[SPEAKER_17]: And as the other buildings are continued, are presently still being assessed, we anticipate that there will continue to be, you know, significant

154
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:54,152
[SPEAKER_17]: requirements from the district to be able to mitigate all of these HVAC challenges that could present themselves in order for us to be able to get schools up and running as quickly as possible.

155
00:11:54,902 --> 00:12:22,713
[SPEAKER_17]: I also want to say to the entire body that we, as the work is being done, we are prepared and fully wanting to come back and share with both you and the school committee the progress of the work that's being done, the status of the work, and where we are in terms of using this funding to remedy the HVAC challenges that have presented themselves.

156
00:12:25,701 --> 00:12:37,954
[SPEAKER_04]: And in terms of total cost for us to bring our HVAC system at Medford High School into compliance and I guess efficient and effective working order.

157
00:12:38,714 --> 00:12:45,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this $816 enough money to do that or will there be a request for a supplemental appropriation at a later date going forward?

158
00:12:46,624 --> 00:12:55,876
[SPEAKER_17]: So at this point in time, we are optimistic that this will allow us to address the high school.

159
00:12:56,898 --> 00:12:58,279
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't know, again,

160
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:07,411
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, we can't, I cannot definitively say that I will not need to come and ask your body for additional funding.

161
00:13:08,072 --> 00:13:27,856
[SPEAKER_17]: Our hope is that the 816,000 will allow us to be able to address all of the key challenges with HVAC systems, in particular at the high school, that we would be able to remedy all of the things that were recommended in the reports.

162
00:13:29,746 --> 00:13:38,874
[SPEAKER_04]: And is it still the wishes of the committee to have this account be exclusive to Medford High School only and to the other schools?

163
00:13:38,934 --> 00:13:49,423
[SPEAKER_17]: We would hope that this could be for the high school and if needed for, we know the outside schools are much younger, they're 20 years younger.

164
00:13:49,923 --> 00:13:57,289
[SPEAKER_17]: However, we may need to spend purchasing additional HEPA filters and

165
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:05,761
[SPEAKER_17]: We would hope to be able to use this funding not only at the high school, but potentially at some of the outside schools as well.

166
00:14:06,261 --> 00:14:11,084
[SPEAKER_17]: That would be our hope if other things were to surface.

167
00:14:11,144 --> 00:14:24,651
[SPEAKER_17]: But we know, we're fully aware that the high school needs significant work and that the lion's share of that funding definitely would be spent at the high school complex.

168
00:14:26,023 --> 00:14:35,126
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason I raise the question is because the way that the paper was drafted was that it would be reprogramming the funds to an account exclusive to Medford High School.

169
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:39,827
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know maybe Alicia's on the call, maybe Alicia can elaborate a little bit on that.

170
00:14:40,587 --> 00:14:48,409
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do believe that when it was presented that those funds were restricted exclusively to Medford High School and were not going to be allowed to be used in other schools in the district.

171
00:14:48,489 --> 00:14:50,250
[SPEAKER_04]: If I'm mistaken, please correct me.

172
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:52,431
[SPEAKER_04]: But maybe Ms.

173
00:14:52,471 --> 00:14:53,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Nunley can help us out with that.

174
00:14:55,202 --> 00:14:58,544
[SPEAKER_17]: I also have Mister Murphy, David Murphy on the line.

175
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,486
[SPEAKER_17]: He's on the call as well.

176
00:15:02,267 --> 00:15:04,028
[SPEAKER_17]: And he may be able to weigh in on that.

177
00:15:04,248 --> 00:15:09,292
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, as the numbers are coming in, we know for certain, the roof fans,

178
00:15:11,772 --> 00:15:14,315
[SPEAKER_17]: At the high school, it's going to be a significant investment.

179
00:15:14,775 --> 00:15:32,193
[SPEAKER_17]: And if the funds need to be spent exclusively at the high school, that there is so much work, capital projects, including additional bathrooms and those kinds of things that need to be renovated and updated, that I'm sure that we would be able to use all of this funding in short order.

180
00:15:34,608 --> 00:15:46,760
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's the committee's, the school department's wishes to keep the paper as is and not amend it and allow it for just MHS only because it's only $800,000 and you can spend that all up at the high school, no problem.

181
00:15:51,904 --> 00:15:53,766
[SPEAKER_17]: If it is possible to allow if

182
00:15:55,394 --> 00:16:12,775
[SPEAKER_17]: If there was something that were to come up at one of the other schools and we had to take a very limited amount from this $800,000 to support the other buildings, if that was a possibility, I would ask this body to allow us

183
00:16:13,315 --> 00:16:19,240
[SPEAKER_17]: the additional flexibility to be able to use it throughout all of the schools.

184
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:30,508
[SPEAKER_17]: But if that would be problematic, then I would just say leave it for the high school because we know that there is plenty of work that can be done.

185
00:16:32,049 --> 00:16:33,210
[SPEAKER_04]: It's certainly not a problem for me.

186
00:16:34,051 --> 00:16:39,275
[SPEAKER_04]: The paper came from the administration, so maybe Alicia Nunley, my finance director, can talk a little bit about that.

187
00:16:40,177 --> 00:16:40,757
[SPEAKER_26]: We have the eye.

188
00:16:40,877 --> 00:16:43,558
[SPEAKER_26]: If I may be a chief of staff, Dave Rodriguez has his hand raised.

189
00:16:43,598 --> 00:16:47,019
[SPEAKER_26]: So at this point, I'd recognize chief of staff Rodriguez.

190
00:16:50,239 --> 00:16:54,400
[SPEAKER_21]: So like, I'm happy to answer on her behalf.

191
00:16:54,420 --> 00:17:00,522
[SPEAKER_21]: The reason the paper was drafted in this manner was that it just mirrored the original use of the

192
00:17:05,544 --> 00:17:06,645
[SPEAKER_21]: to high school use.

193
00:17:07,445 --> 00:17:17,071
[SPEAKER_21]: The administration and the mayor are completely in support of removing the high school aspect of that and have it be applicable to the rest of the public school system and the rest of the buildings there.

194
00:17:17,591 --> 00:17:26,137
[SPEAKER_21]: My understanding, after speaking with Alicia, is that this is completely improper and that it's completely in line with what the administration can do with these funding.

195
00:17:28,278 --> 00:17:29,218
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'd have to amend the paper?

196
00:17:39,947 --> 00:17:46,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, I would offer that in the form of a motion to amend the paper to reflect that these funds can be used across the school district, not just exclusive to Medford High School.

197
00:17:46,512 --> 00:17:46,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Second.

198
00:17:47,353 --> 00:17:52,637
[SPEAKER_26]: On the motion of Councilor Knight to amend the paper, seconded by Councilor Scott Kelly.

199
00:17:53,638 --> 00:17:55,019
[SPEAKER_26]: Clerk, do you have the wording on that?

200
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:57,641
[SPEAKER_26]: On the amendment?

201
00:17:58,861 --> 00:17:59,122
[SPEAKER_22]: I second.

202
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:14,875
[SPEAKER_22]: So Councilor Knight's amendment is to allow the schools to use the funds across the school district, not just at the high school.

203
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:15,616
[SPEAKER_03]: That is correct.

204
00:18:15,856 --> 00:18:16,156
[SPEAKER_26]: Correct.

205
00:18:19,339 --> 00:18:20,720
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Knight, do you have any further questions?

206
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:21,921
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it for me, sir.

207
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:22,281
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

208
00:18:22,542 --> 00:18:23,302
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

209
00:18:23,322 --> 00:18:23,963
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Marks.

210
00:18:25,334 --> 00:18:31,816
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you, Mr. President, and I thank the superintendent for being on the call tonight and the administrative staff.

211
00:18:32,777 --> 00:18:45,881
[SPEAKER_33]: The email we received today talks about WB engineering report and that the amount to look at ventilation air quality, air exchange would significantly exceed $200,000.

212
00:18:45,921 --> 00:18:46,342
[SPEAKER_33]: I was just wondering,

213
00:18:53,180 --> 00:19:00,231
[SPEAKER_33]: regarding the 200,000, is that particularly to the high school or is that in general across the board?

214
00:19:00,979 --> 00:19:06,462
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, this first report that was released by WB Engineering was exclusively to high school.

215
00:19:07,743 --> 00:19:19,049
[SPEAKER_17]: And so, that $200,000 to exceed the $200,000 was just for some of the mitigation work that needs to be done exclusively at the high school.

216
00:19:20,429 --> 00:19:21,670
[SPEAKER_17]: We have not received,

217
00:19:23,951 --> 00:19:32,558
[SPEAKER_17]: all of the remaining engineering reports for the remaining outside schools, because the high school being the largest building takes the most time.

218
00:19:34,059 --> 00:19:38,522
[SPEAKER_33]: Okay, so Madam Superintendent, you mentioned the roof fans.

219
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:45,207
[SPEAKER_33]: At Medford High School, I guess roughly 100 roof fans at an estimated cost of $125,000.

220
00:19:45,247 --> 00:19:47,769
[SPEAKER_33]: Is that part of this $200,000 that's listed as WB engineering report?

221
00:19:54,810 --> 00:20:04,112
[SPEAKER_17]: So that $150,000 was in addition, I believe that the amount of the 150,000 was for the repairing of the roof fans.

222
00:20:04,812 --> 00:20:12,034
[SPEAKER_17]: And then there are other mitigation strategies, which could potentially include HECA filters and those kinds of things.

223
00:20:12,834 --> 00:20:14,214
[SPEAKER_17]: It's likely to not exceed 200,000.

224
00:20:14,334 --> 00:20:15,615
[SPEAKER_17]: And I, again, significantly exceed that.

225
00:20:22,074 --> 00:20:36,624
[SPEAKER_17]: But I, again, I do have David Murphy on the call and John McLaughlin, so I don't know if Clerk Hurtubise could unmute them so they could weigh in as well.

226
00:20:36,644 --> 00:20:39,626
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, I'm about to unmute John McLaughlin.

227
00:20:40,887 --> 00:20:45,390
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, John, you've been unmuted, and David Murphy has been unmuted as well.

228
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:46,932
[SPEAKER_26]: David Murphy?

229
00:20:46,952 --> 00:20:48,753
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm sorry, David Murphy, I apologize.

230
00:20:55,308 --> 00:20:59,230
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilman Marks, did you have a specific question for John McLaughlin?

231
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:09,156
[SPEAKER_33]: My question is regarding the $200,000 that was mentioned within the email we got today and also a previous email we received from the mayor.

232
00:21:09,616 --> 00:21:22,583
[SPEAKER_33]: It mentioned that each classroom needed these filters at $1,500 a piece, but it didn't mention how many classrooms and if it was just the high school or if it was classrooms across the entire city.

233
00:21:24,019 --> 00:21:27,543
[SPEAKER_18]: I think I can respond to that, and I would ask Mr. McLaughlin to jump in.

234
00:21:27,563 --> 00:21:31,849
[SPEAKER_18]: For those of you who don't know, I'm the assistant superintendent for finance and operations.

235
00:21:31,929 --> 00:21:39,178
[SPEAKER_18]: I began work with the Medford Public Schools approximately three weeks ago, and so I've been clinging to John to try to get my own

236
00:21:42,393 --> 00:21:45,895
[SPEAKER_18]: I think for this particular question, I can answer and I'd ask John to fill in the details.

237
00:21:46,275 --> 00:21:52,619
[SPEAKER_18]: So where we are right now is we have the initial assessment from WB Engineering of Medford High School.

238
00:21:53,619 --> 00:21:56,181
[SPEAKER_18]: There is a tremendous amount of information in that report.

239
00:21:56,481 --> 00:22:05,686
[SPEAKER_18]: We've been working with WB and have additional meetings scheduled with them in the coming days to make a determination as to which of the mitigation strategies

240
00:22:06,646 --> 00:22:09,527
[SPEAKER_18]: that they have identified in that report should be utilized.

241
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:21,313
[SPEAKER_18]: It looks to us like an estimate or a middle of the road approach to the work that they have acknowledged could be useful is somewhere in the vicinity of $200,000.

242
00:22:21,653 --> 00:22:23,333
[SPEAKER_18]: That's where that estimate came from.

243
00:22:23,794 --> 00:22:31,297
[SPEAKER_18]: The rough estimate of the $150,000 is specific to the work that is estimated needs to be done

244
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:54,880
[SPEAKER_18]: that we're looking at over $400,000 of potential work that has been identified, but the $200,000 number, the potential assess mitigation strategies at Medford High School, a comparable report has not yet been done at the other schools.

245
00:22:55,300 --> 00:23:01,403
The reason for that is we are currently testing both for air quality and

246
00:23:03,692 --> 00:23:05,316
for that expense is also also

247
00:23:16,682 --> 00:23:28,531
[SPEAKER_18]: And then once we have the data from that testing, we'll be in a better position to determine whether or not we should commission a similar assessment at the other schools, the way we have for Bedford High School.

248
00:23:28,891 --> 00:23:43,021
[SPEAKER_18]: And it says in the memo that there is a, we understand there's an unusual sequence to having already received recommendations with regard to mitigation strategies at the high school, while the testing across the district, both at the high school and other schools,

249
00:23:44,102 --> 00:23:51,744
And the reason for that is the high school is a unique entity, both with regard to its size, its age, and the complexity of its systems.

250
00:23:51,784 --> 00:23:53,625
And so we pushed forward with that study right away.

251
00:23:53,945 --> 00:23:55,806
And we solicited proposals.

252
00:23:55,826 --> 00:23:58,987
We have already three proposals to do similar work at the other schools.

253
00:23:59,007 --> 00:24:06,509
[SPEAKER_18]: And we're going to hold off on actually commissioning that and making that investment until we actually have the data back from the testing that's currently being done.

254
00:24:08,968 --> 00:24:17,933
[SPEAKER_33]: So through you, Mr. President, when was the WB engineering study commissioned by the school department and voted on by the school committee?

255
00:24:20,055 --> 00:24:29,400
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd have to defer on the vote of the school committee question, but it was commissioned, I believe, on the week of August 17th.

256
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,701
[SPEAKER_18]: Potentially August 25th.

257
00:24:30,781 --> 00:24:31,922
[SPEAKER_18]: It was in that range.

258
00:24:33,631 --> 00:24:39,256
[SPEAKER_33]: Is there a particular reason why the school district waited so long to commission an air quality study?

259
00:24:40,417 --> 00:24:51,968
[SPEAKER_18]: I think the point that is, I think we should sort of preface all of this commentary with is that we actually have no evidence right now that there is anything wrong with the air quality.

260
00:24:52,308 --> 00:24:56,192
[SPEAKER_18]: Frankly, I understand there's a history and there have been some persistent questions, but

261
00:24:56,652 --> 00:25:01,916
[SPEAKER_18]: to make sure that we provide as much defense against any type of virus transmission.

262
00:25:02,196 --> 00:25:03,216
[SPEAKER_18]: But I think there's been a

263
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:25,265
[SPEAKER_33]: Right.

264
00:25:25,505 --> 00:25:29,307
[SPEAKER_33]: And when did we find out there's hot evidence now that says the quality of air is fine?

265
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:33,970
[SPEAKER_18]: To be candid, I don't have any evidence that that is the case.

266
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:44,335
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's an attempt to, given the context and the anxiety that folks are feeling, trying to be as responsive as possible to some of the concerns that have been raised.

267
00:25:44,756 --> 00:25:44,936
[SPEAKER_33]: Right.

268
00:25:45,416 --> 00:25:58,310
[SPEAKER_33]: Right, so I'm just wondering why for the past six months, the school administration, knowing that eventually we're going to have faculty, students, staff back within our public schools.

269
00:25:59,191 --> 00:26:07,299
[SPEAKER_33]: Over the last six months, didn't realize that a first step would have been to do an air quality test within the schools.

270
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,802
[SPEAKER_33]: And I'm not sure why it took so long to do that.

271
00:26:11,682 --> 00:26:17,765
[SPEAKER_33]: But putting that aside, Mr. President, this was tabled two weeks ago.

272
00:26:18,866 --> 00:26:28,892
[SPEAKER_33]: And one of the motions made by the council was to ask the administration and the school committee for a list of their priorities.

273
00:26:29,612 --> 00:26:33,013
[SPEAKER_33]: Because at the time we heard of a number of priorities.

274
00:26:33,873 --> 00:26:39,495
[SPEAKER_33]: One being ventilation, air quality, air exchange in order to provide a healthy and safe building.

275
00:26:40,195 --> 00:26:44,957
[SPEAKER_33]: But we also heard about handicapped ramps accessibility.

276
00:26:45,257 --> 00:26:53,860
[SPEAKER_33]: We also heard about the condition of our restrooms within the school department and a number of other concerns as well, Mr. President.

277
00:26:54,280 --> 00:27:08,642
[SPEAKER_33]: We just recently received an email from the mayor stating that if we could release the funds, they're also looking to use some of the funds for beautification purposes in the main entrance.

278
00:27:09,303 --> 00:27:15,231
[SPEAKER_33]: which I know firsthand that that is something that's needed, Mr. President.

279
00:27:15,651 --> 00:27:21,198
[SPEAKER_33]: I was part of the crew that painted that several months back under the leadership of Bill Carr Jr.

280
00:27:21,218 --> 00:27:24,462
[SPEAKER_33]: and a number of volunteers, so I know that's needed.

281
00:27:24,923 --> 00:27:27,626
[SPEAKER_33]: But I believe, and I can't speak for my colleagues,

282
00:27:28,227 --> 00:27:42,716
[SPEAKER_33]: Why we asked for a priority list was to make sure that we had a reasonable assessment, Mr. President, on what are we going to do to get our children, and our teachers, and our faculty, and our staff back into a safe building.

283
00:27:43,497 --> 00:27:48,300
[SPEAKER_33]: And to me, beautification of a front entrance is probably at the bottom of the list.

284
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:55,525
[SPEAKER_33]: And air quality, and air exchange, and ventilation, and other priorities, Mr. President, would be at the top of the list.

285
00:27:56,185 --> 00:28:00,247
[SPEAKER_33]: And that's what I was hoping to receive from the administration and the school committee.

286
00:28:00,987 --> 00:28:09,772
[SPEAKER_33]: And to be quite frank, I am very disappointed that we didn't even get a response, Mr. President, from the council motion that was two weeks ago.

287
00:28:09,832 --> 00:28:11,012
[SPEAKER_33]: That was from August 25th.

288
00:28:13,173 --> 00:28:16,696
[SPEAKER_33]: Unless I'm mistaken, I have yet to receive anything, Mr. President.

289
00:28:17,716 --> 00:28:22,459
[SPEAKER_33]: That's not to say that I realize that work needs to be done in that building.

290
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:36,709
[SPEAKER_33]: But it would be helpful, Mr. President, if we're going to work in cooperation with the school side, that if we have requests, that they recognize and honor our request, Mr. President, as well.

291
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:43,896
[SPEAKER_33]: I have no problem allotting money, Mr. President, but I'd like to know what it's going to go towards.

292
00:28:44,356 --> 00:28:55,507
[SPEAKER_33]: Now, if we free up $800,000 tonight to go into this fund, there's no saying that they won't end up doing beautification over ventilation.

293
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:59,131
[SPEAKER_33]: I would hope that's not the case, Mr. President.

294
00:28:59,851 --> 00:29:12,115
[SPEAKER_33]: And clearly, if there are 100 fans that are currently not working on the roof, you can almost bet your bottom dollar the air quality and circulation in that building is not good, Mr. President.

295
00:29:12,495 --> 00:29:14,116
[SPEAKER_33]: So this is not rocket science.

296
00:29:14,676 --> 00:29:16,376
[SPEAKER_33]: They're already coming out saying they have to

297
00:29:17,957 --> 00:29:23,679
[SPEAKER_33]: can't change out all the filters, the fans on the roof aren't working, over 100 fans.

298
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:26,399
[SPEAKER_33]: That's what circulates air within a building.

299
00:29:26,679 --> 00:29:31,361
[SPEAKER_33]: That's what provides proper air quality and air exchange and ventilation.

300
00:29:32,581 --> 00:29:35,142
[SPEAKER_33]: So those are the concerns I have, Mr. President.

301
00:29:35,762 --> 00:29:47,507
[SPEAKER_33]: And maybe if the superintendent or someone else from the administration can assure us that if we do release money tonight, that the priority is to get people back into the building.

302
00:29:47,927 --> 00:29:57,851
[SPEAKER_33]: And to make sure that the air quality and the safety of our students, and our teachers, and our staff, and our faculty is the number one priority, Mr. President.

303
00:29:58,231 --> 00:29:59,832
[SPEAKER_33]: And then we can look at other needs.

304
00:30:00,592 --> 00:30:09,476
[SPEAKER_33]: My other point, Mr. President, is two weeks ago, Alicia Nunley represented to us when we took the vote that there was other money available.

305
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:19,820
[SPEAKER_33]: I believe I asked the question, because it was led to believe that if we didn't vote two weeks ago, that we were stalling students from getting back into the building.

306
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:26,562
[SPEAKER_33]: And I asked Alicia Nunley that question, and she said, there are CARES Act money available, and there's COVID-19 funds.

307
00:30:28,183 --> 00:30:34,188
[SPEAKER_33]: that are available to work with the air quality and safety concerns.

308
00:30:34,889 --> 00:30:40,054
[SPEAKER_33]: So that's why I voted the way I did, Mr. President, knowing that there's other additional funds out there.

309
00:30:40,694 --> 00:30:45,759
[SPEAKER_33]: And that the fact that I want to make sure as one member that if we're going to allot money,

310
00:30:47,138 --> 00:30:51,801
[SPEAKER_33]: that it go into the safety of our faculty, students, and kids, Mr. President.

311
00:30:52,282 --> 00:31:05,712
[SPEAKER_33]: And I'm sure the school committee and the administration share the concerns, but if we're going to be responsible for allocating this money, like every other paper, Mr. President, it'd be nice to have a paper in front of us.

312
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:17,556
[SPEAKER_33]: And I received an email today that I just happened to be able to take a look at just briefly, but I still haven't seen anything that prioritizes work.

313
00:31:17,896 --> 00:31:28,582
[SPEAKER_33]: And I realize the testing is still underway and current, but that's why I felt that if this happened two, three, four months ago,

314
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:41,005
[SPEAKER_33]: Don't forget the money that was in this account from the science labs, the 700,000, that's been sitting in the account for five years, Mr. President.

315
00:31:41,546 --> 00:31:42,106
[SPEAKER_33]: Think about it.

316
00:31:42,606 --> 00:31:49,530
[SPEAKER_33]: We could have moved that money in for restrooms in the high school for the past five years, for working water bubblers.

317
00:31:50,091 --> 00:31:53,112
[SPEAKER_33]: You name it, Mr. President, what's needed in that high school.

318
00:31:53,813 --> 00:31:56,954
[SPEAKER_33]: So this is money that could have been used over the past five years.

319
00:31:59,096 --> 00:32:01,898
[SPEAKER_33]: So those are the concerns I have, Mr. President.

320
00:32:02,358 --> 00:32:20,071
[SPEAKER_33]: If the superintendent can assure me tonight that this money will be prioritized for the reopening and the ventilation and air quality and air exchange and safety concerns over aesthetics and beautification at this particular stage, I will give it a vote tonight.

321
00:32:20,531 --> 00:32:23,053
[SPEAKER_33]: If not, Mr. President, I will not move forward.

322
00:32:23,714 --> 00:32:24,014
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

323
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:38,512
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, I can assure Councilor Marks and the entire council that our intention is to get the buildings up and running as quickly as possible so that we can have students return.

324
00:32:38,692 --> 00:32:40,293
[SPEAKER_17]: That is our highest priority.

325
00:32:41,233 --> 00:32:50,079
[SPEAKER_17]: The concerns about the ADA, which I did mention, accessibility at the front of the high school, that is something that has always been a concern.

326
00:32:51,039 --> 00:33:12,055
[SPEAKER_17]: a concern and so in fixing the ADA ramps at the front of the high school, the main entrance, at the same time that that's being fixed, in essence, you would be able to fix the school aesthetically by making it more handicap accessible and doing the work that needs to be done there.

327
00:33:12,715 --> 00:33:24,180
[SPEAKER_17]: But again, our priority is to be able to get the school up and running, meeting the HVAC standards and proper air ventilation in the entire complex.

328
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,501
[SPEAKER_17]: We want students to be safe.

329
00:33:26,541 --> 00:33:27,902
[SPEAKER_17]: We want our staff to be safe.

330
00:33:28,902 --> 00:33:31,483
[SPEAKER_17]: everyone coming to work into the building to be safe.

331
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:33,643
[SPEAKER_17]: So that is our highest priority.

332
00:33:33,823 --> 00:33:38,204
[SPEAKER_17]: And I can assure you as the entire council, that that's what we can focus on.

333
00:33:38,784 --> 00:33:45,485
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, we are also willing to come before you as we continue to get additional reports.

334
00:33:46,786 --> 00:33:57,928
[SPEAKER_17]: And as work is being done to come and update the council on the status of the work and how much of the money has been spent as well, as we continue to do the same for the school committee.

335
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:12,150
[SPEAKER_17]: But I do want to stress that this funding will be a tremendous help to the schools and allow us to be able to open and get kids back in the schools as quickly as possible.

336
00:34:14,392 --> 00:34:15,652
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Superintendent Edward.

337
00:34:15,672 --> 00:34:17,274
[SPEAKER_26]: Vincent, thank you, Councilor Marks.

338
00:34:18,274 --> 00:34:21,657
[SPEAKER_26]: We have up next, Vice President Carviello and then Councilor Morrell.

339
00:34:22,397 --> 00:34:23,038
[SPEAKER_23]: Vice President.

340
00:34:23,198 --> 00:34:23,979
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Mr. President.

341
00:34:24,219 --> 00:34:26,620
[SPEAKER_23]: Mr. President, over eight years ago,

342
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:34,315
[SPEAKER_23]: I brought up the heating and ventilation of all the schools with the exception of the high school.

343
00:34:34,776 --> 00:34:36,857
[SPEAKER_23]: And so again, this is not a new problem.

344
00:34:37,137 --> 00:34:39,379
[SPEAKER_23]: This has been going on long before the COVID came in.

345
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:49,387
[SPEAKER_23]: What is the plan to address those schools that have been, for all those units that haven't been operating in there for many years, Madam Superintendent?

346
00:34:53,812 --> 00:34:57,954
[SPEAKER_17]: Last year, for example, we did a lot of work on some of the outside buildings.

347
00:34:58,034 --> 00:35:09,278
[SPEAKER_17]: I know the Columbus, we had a lot of units that were updated and if something wasn't working, there were a lot of repairs that were made to the outside schools.

348
00:35:10,138 --> 00:35:20,462
[SPEAKER_17]: And so we are committed to having all buildings fully functioning, the outside buildings with their air conditioning and their heating to be working.

349
00:35:21,122 --> 00:35:25,385
[SPEAKER_17]: So we are committed to doing that, and that work has been ongoing.

350
00:35:26,265 --> 00:35:29,567
[SPEAKER_23]: Now, what about the air quality in those buildings, Madam Superintendent?

351
00:35:30,228 --> 00:35:36,812
[SPEAKER_17]: So the air quality in all of the outside buildings, they are currently still being assessed right now.

352
00:35:36,912 --> 00:35:48,139
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, as I had said earlier, the high school being the largest complex, essentially the other schools can all fit into the high school complex.

353
00:35:49,024 --> 00:35:52,505
[SPEAKER_17]: that this building took the longest amount of time.

354
00:35:53,205 --> 00:36:00,747
[SPEAKER_17]: And the engineers from the different engineering companies, they are out in the field right now doing the assessments on the outside buildings as well.

355
00:36:00,927 --> 00:36:02,427
[SPEAKER_17]: So that is ongoing work.

356
00:36:03,687 --> 00:36:15,170
[SPEAKER_23]: Madam Superintendent, how are we addressing the inequality issues in the high school with the classrooms that are on the inside of the corridor with no windows?

357
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,368
[SPEAKER_17]: So exactly, that is a great question.

358
00:36:18,768 --> 00:36:30,252
[SPEAKER_17]: So we are fully aware of the classrooms that do not have any windows at all, the inner classrooms in B building and C building, B building on the second floor.

359
00:36:30,792 --> 00:36:42,216
[SPEAKER_17]: And so there are some classrooms that we are looking to take offline and there are other classrooms where what would be appropriate would be to put in the,

360
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,662
[SPEAKER_17]: HEPA filters in other classrooms.

361
00:36:47,682 --> 00:36:48,843
[SPEAKER_17]: Can you give me like five minutes?

362
00:36:49,263 --> 00:36:49,363
[SPEAKER_21]: Yep.

363
00:36:50,224 --> 00:37:02,814
[SPEAKER_17]: To put in air quality in the HEPA filters in the other buildings to be able to, those rooms, to be able to increase the air quality in that space.

364
00:37:04,135 --> 00:37:09,999
[SPEAKER_23]: Will you be utilizing some of the theaters in that building, the study halls?

365
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:27,105
[SPEAKER_17]: For the study halls, if they met the air quality standard, once all of the spaces meet the correct standard, every space will be able to be used.

366
00:37:27,565 --> 00:37:33,008
[SPEAKER_17]: If there's an area that it can't be used, we were given suggestions to mitigate that.

367
00:37:33,148 --> 00:37:39,791
[SPEAKER_17]: So whether it's looking at the windows or adding HEPA filters,

368
00:37:41,331 --> 00:37:44,473
[SPEAKER_17]: but to increase the air ventilation and air circulation.

369
00:37:46,033 --> 00:38:00,979
[SPEAKER_23]: Once we establish a list and do the repairs to the high school, is there talk about bringing on a company on retainer to monitor these on a regular basis?

370
00:38:01,499 --> 00:38:09,407
[SPEAKER_23]: not just do it and walk away, but have a company that'll come in there, have somebody on retainer to constantly monitor these classrooms.

371
00:38:09,447 --> 00:38:15,773
[SPEAKER_23]: because I'm sure those filters are going to need to be replaced on a constant basis.

372
00:38:16,694 --> 00:38:18,776
[SPEAKER_23]: So is that something in the plans?

373
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:30,932
[SPEAKER_17]: It is, one of the suggestions that we already have in plans is to increase, normally filters were changed twice a year and we're gonna increase that and double the filters being changed.

374
00:38:31,872 --> 00:38:49,075
[SPEAKER_17]: So there are steps that we have already begun to put in place that we're gonna use moving forward to help all of the schools and to just keep a high level of air quality for everyone, all staff working and students in the Medford Public Schools.

375
00:38:50,208 --> 00:38:56,489
[SPEAKER_23]: And as far as the bathrooms that we've been talking about for many years, what's going to be happening with those?

376
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:06,748
[SPEAKER_17]: So we would definitely like to upgrade and renovate the bathrooms, and that's still on our list to get that work done.

377
00:39:07,229 --> 00:39:14,696
[SPEAKER_17]: But for right now, we really are prioritizing HVAC systems, the air quality, et cetera, testing.

378
00:39:14,836 --> 00:39:21,163
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's our biggest priority first, and then we will definitely be tackling the bathrooms as well.

379
00:39:22,064 --> 00:39:32,167
[SPEAKER_23]: And I will echo my fellow council's remarks is I'd like to see a list, a detailed list of what's going on versus just talking about it.

380
00:39:32,187 --> 00:39:40,170
[SPEAKER_23]: So if we can get that to us as soon as possible, that would be greatly appreciated, even though we asked for it a couple of weeks ago.

381
00:39:41,772 --> 00:39:47,613
[SPEAKER_17]: So the reports that were shared today were some of just the preliminary reports that we have.

382
00:39:48,073 --> 00:39:53,834
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't have other reports as of yet because the testing is still ongoing.

383
00:39:54,434 --> 00:40:01,255
[SPEAKER_17]: But as soon as we have additional reports to share, we will gladly share that with the entire council.

384
00:40:01,975 --> 00:40:09,957
[SPEAKER_23]: And one last question, which is kind of a, what would the school department have done if we didn't find this $800,000?

385
00:40:13,176 --> 00:40:14,557
[SPEAKER_23]: Where would this funding come from?

386
00:40:14,577 --> 00:40:27,369
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, it's kind of- It would have been a tremendous challenge, and we would have needed to ask for additional support.

387
00:40:27,389 --> 00:40:29,811
[SPEAKER_23]: All right, well, thank you.

388
00:40:30,852 --> 00:40:32,093
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Vice President Carbiel.

389
00:40:33,034 --> 00:40:33,655
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Morrell.

390
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,361
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

391
00:40:37,521 --> 00:40:40,204
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to thank members of the school administration for being here tonight.

392
00:40:40,664 --> 00:40:53,977
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand the acute and immediate need of the schools in this time as far as preparing for the safest possible environment, and I also understand just the need to be agile and responsive in these times, especially when metrics and goalposts keep shifting.

393
00:40:54,758 --> 00:40:58,522
[SPEAKER_07]: So I thank you for your work on this, and I do hope we can move this paper forward tonight.

394
00:40:58,942 --> 00:40:59,583
[SPEAKER_07]: My question is,

395
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:05,906
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Marks touched on this a bit about the HEPA filters, the $1,500 HEPA filters that are mentioned.

396
00:41:06,766 --> 00:41:12,789
[SPEAKER_07]: And I apologize if I missed this, but is there a ballpark number of the number of these we might need?

397
00:41:14,809 --> 00:41:24,413
[SPEAKER_17]: So as we are waiting on the additional reports from the outside schools as well,

398
00:41:25,889 --> 00:41:34,337
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't have a specific number, but I would like to defer to Assistant Superintendent David Murphy as well.

399
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:35,638
[SPEAKER_17]: I think he got muted.

400
00:41:36,099 --> 00:41:37,280
[SPEAKER_17]: I would like to defer to him.

401
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:44,947
[SPEAKER_17]: He may have more of the specifics in terms of the total number of filters needed at the high school.

402
00:41:46,329 --> 00:41:46,709
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

403
00:41:46,969 --> 00:41:47,230
[SPEAKER_27]: David.

404
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:48,771
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Superintendent.

405
00:41:50,169 --> 00:41:52,510
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that's a good point.

406
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:59,812
[SPEAKER_18]: that information because there was a variety of recommendations that were contained in WB's initial report.

407
00:42:00,352 --> 00:42:04,354
[SPEAKER_18]: We've been using a number that exceeds a 100, it's either 116 or 119 based on our very

408
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:21,916
[SPEAKER_18]: we're not going to be able to sort of clean or attaching ourselves too much to that specific number because a lot of this testing is going on.

409
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:34,967
[SPEAKER_18]: And as I said before, there is sort of an unusual sequence to this in that we're in a two-week window of testing and we're getting that data and hope to have all of it somewhere between

410
00:42:40,811 --> 00:42:44,952
[SPEAKER_18]: that's why we commission this initial report.

411
00:42:45,012 --> 00:42:58,019
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're using a number in the vicinity of 1, 10 to 1, 20, but that is without having fully digested or analyze the findings of WB or having access to the

412
00:43:06,502 --> 00:43:20,568
[SPEAKER_18]: the number as stated in the memo, it's significant, and that's why we're using sort of a placeholder number of $200,000 with regard to infrastructure, internal to Medford High School.

413
00:43:21,868 --> 00:43:31,532
[SPEAKER_18]: But I can't say that after we've had a chance to truly analyze both the report and the data, I can't say that we may modify that position.

414
00:43:31,572 --> 00:43:34,153
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, John, I don't know if you want to add anything to that.

415
00:43:35,733 --> 00:43:42,639
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, yeah, and we're going to meet again Thursday with the engineer.

416
00:43:42,659 --> 00:43:49,025
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're going to probably try to get some high numbers of where we need additional support.

417
00:43:49,846 --> 00:43:52,148
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's sort of where we stand right now.

418
00:43:53,789 --> 00:43:56,472
Yeah, I mean, the big thing for us is we want to make

419
00:43:57,265 --> 00:44:05,412
[SPEAKER_18]: decisions as to how to use based on as much data as possible, understanding that we're obviously very much up against the clock.

420
00:44:06,493 --> 00:44:20,386
[SPEAKER_18]: But based on our current implementation plan with regard to when students will be in the building, we have these coming weeks to try to utilize whatever mitigation strategies we think are necessary to have as much defense as possible.

421
00:44:21,917 --> 00:44:22,617
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thank you.

422
00:44:22,657 --> 00:44:24,818
[SPEAKER_07]: And then just one more question through the chair if I could.

423
00:44:27,298 --> 00:44:40,762
[SPEAKER_07]: Does the assessment point to that these HEPA filters would then meet the needs or is there a chance we're going to put these HEPA filters in and it's tested again and we find that we have to go, you know, even farther as far as the HVAC and things like that?

424
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:43,640
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that's an excellent question.

425
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:56,643
[SPEAKER_18]: And exactly the questions that we're currently posing to the engineers that we're meeting with to make a determination as to, I think both exactly what is the impact now and what is the impact long term?

426
00:44:56,683 --> 00:45:06,244
[SPEAKER_18]: Because right now there's sort of a heightened standard that industry experts are advising districts and other employers, frankly, to potentially utilize.

427
00:45:06,364 --> 00:45:09,685
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think there's a question as to, once we spend the $200,000,

428
00:45:14,813 --> 00:45:20,557
[SPEAKER_18]: the building, what exactly is the return on investment going forward?

429
00:45:20,577 --> 00:45:24,359
[SPEAKER_18]: And obviously, we want the best air quality and best air exchange rates possible.

430
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:31,184
[SPEAKER_18]: And at the same time, as I said, today, we have no evidence that there's an actual problem with the building.

431
00:45:31,224 --> 00:45:35,487
[SPEAKER_18]: But we're also operating in a context in which, again, people have very understanding of the

432
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:40,251
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thank you.

433
00:45:40,271 --> 00:45:57,549
[SPEAKER_07]: So really what I'm hearing is essentially it's just the nature of the beast because of the way these standards are coming down and just looking into the building this way, things are changing and sometimes it can be hard to nail down exact amounts because of that, but the intention is there as laid out in these papers and in the email we got, correct?

434
00:45:58,430 --> 00:45:59,571
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think that's correct.

435
00:45:59,611 --> 00:46:23,040
[SPEAKER_18]: And to the superintendent's point that she made earlier, we certainly recognize our responsibility to report back, obviously, to the Medford School Committee and also to the Medford City Council, as to exactly what strategies are being employed, what impact we foresee those strategies having, and what is the return on investment for the community, whether it be installing capital filters, repairing fans on the roof,

436
00:46:23,501 --> 00:46:24,902
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that's all I have to say.

437
00:46:24,943 --> 00:46:25,824
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that's all I have to say.

438
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:40,601
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Mr. President.

439
00:46:40,721 --> 00:46:42,021
[SPEAKER_29]: I have a few.

440
00:46:42,101 --> 00:46:44,002
[SPEAKER_29]: I know that the council has asked some great questions.

441
00:46:45,002 --> 00:46:49,945
[SPEAKER_29]: Just to the superintendent, if I can, Mr. President, or Mr. Rodriguez.

442
00:46:50,905 --> 00:46:57,108
[SPEAKER_29]: Legally, the money that was left in those accounts, it's okay to be used in this form.

443
00:46:57,928 --> 00:47:01,170
[SPEAKER_29]: I know that sometimes when you get money in certain grants or

444
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:11,754
[SPEAKER_29]: You have to use specific reasons, I just want to reassure that they are being used for what's intended and we can still move forward with that.

445
00:47:17,456 --> 00:47:27,000
[SPEAKER_26]: If we could have someone from the administration, I'm not sure if Dave or Superintendent Edward Vincent, if you could, let's see, Dave Rodriguez, Chief of Staff.

446
00:47:29,461 --> 00:47:29,681
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

447
00:47:30,765 --> 00:47:31,485
[SPEAKER_21]: this case.

448
00:47:43,877 --> 00:47:47,718
[SPEAKER_21]: in order to just reauthorize it, essentially reauthorizing the use of the funds.

449
00:47:48,218 --> 00:47:52,859
[SPEAKER_21]: The funds have already been borrowed, they're cash in hand, so we don't have to go out to bond for these proceeds.

450
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:56,000
[SPEAKER_21]: And we've actually been paying debt service on them since they were borrowed.

451
00:47:56,660 --> 00:48:06,823
[SPEAKER_21]: So we've been sending you an account that we've been paying debt service on since they were borrowed, by reprogramming them so we're allowed to release those funds for that specific use, pursuant to the reauthorization.

452
00:48:07,663 --> 00:48:08,823
[SPEAKER_21]: That's allowed under Chapter 44.

453
00:48:08,903 --> 00:48:12,924
[SPEAKER_21]: I forget the exact section, but it's quoted within the council paper.

454
00:48:13,742 --> 00:48:14,523
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

455
00:48:15,464 --> 00:48:19,848
[SPEAKER_29]: Mr. President, to the superintendent, I know probably one of the oldest schools is Curtis Tough School.

456
00:48:20,569 --> 00:48:27,235
[SPEAKER_29]: Are we still planning on having a program running in a positive manner that it's always run?

457
00:48:27,776 --> 00:48:31,099
[SPEAKER_29]: And how does that look with air quality testing?

458
00:48:31,139 --> 00:48:34,122
[SPEAKER_29]: Is that one of the schools being looked at as we speak?

459
00:48:34,943 --> 00:48:45,550
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, so ironically enough, because the Curtis Tufts is actually the oldest building, they have very, very large windows that can open.

460
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:46,751
[SPEAKER_17]: And so one of the best

461
00:48:49,299 --> 00:48:56,666
[SPEAKER_17]: based on what the engineers feedback that the engineers have given to us is to allow natural air to come into the spaces.

462
00:48:57,287 --> 00:49:04,253
[SPEAKER_17]: So the Curtis Tufts has, you know, very tall ceilings, very large windows in every single classroom.

463
00:49:05,514 --> 00:49:14,823
[SPEAKER_17]: So although we know we'll be waiting for what the reports say, we anticipate very good remarks, scores for the Curtis Tufts

464
00:49:16,244 --> 00:49:23,348
[SPEAKER_17]: that they have the ability to let in a lot of natural air to support air quality at that facility.

465
00:49:23,928 --> 00:49:29,191
[SPEAKER_17]: So we are waiting again for the final reports from the outside schools that are still ongoing.

466
00:49:30,012 --> 00:49:42,019
[SPEAKER_17]: And again, if air filters or something like that is needed, we are prepared to put those in place at all of the buildings, including the Curtis House.

467
00:49:44,635 --> 00:49:49,797
[SPEAKER_29]: Madam Superintendent, what neighbor communities and other schools are using across the country.

468
00:49:50,577 --> 00:49:54,198
[SPEAKER_29]: Have we looked at using the viability of the gymnasium?

469
00:49:54,899 --> 00:50:00,260
[SPEAKER_29]: We probably have one of the biggest gymnasiums in the state, and to use those as classrooms.

470
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:09,764
[SPEAKER_29]: I think that could be a viable way to move some of those classes that have some issues that can't be repaired.

471
00:50:09,844 --> 00:50:13,525
[SPEAKER_29]: But is that something that we're investigating too?

472
00:50:15,644 --> 00:50:23,667
[SPEAKER_17]: But we have not ruled out using alternative spaces within the high school complex in particular.

473
00:50:24,508 --> 00:50:36,153
[SPEAKER_17]: The only fear is, you know, we have very, very long winters and it is important for students to be able, while the weather permitting, you know, they can go outside and use the outside fields.

474
00:50:36,993 --> 00:50:40,117
[SPEAKER_17]: But that would be something that we would have to look at.

475
00:50:40,197 --> 00:50:48,847
[SPEAKER_17]: But as a temporary measure, we would not rule out having to use other spaces, including the gymnasium.

476
00:50:49,168 --> 00:50:49,488
[SPEAKER_29]: OK.

477
00:50:50,729 --> 00:50:53,973
[SPEAKER_29]: And again, to the superintendent, through you, Mr. President,

478
00:50:57,286 --> 00:51:08,440
[SPEAKER_29]: No one thought you're going to come into Medford, become the new superintendent, handle a pandemic and other issues and the concerns that we're seeing today in society.

479
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:13,727
[SPEAKER_29]: I know that with the race issues we have, I think that I've talked to some teachers and

480
00:51:15,148 --> 00:51:27,040
[SPEAKER_29]: Already the staff in professional development, you've already started a dialogue that's talking about race and making sure that our teachers are prepared for our questions from our students.

481
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:36,329
[SPEAKER_29]: Because there are going to be a lot of questions, a lot of concerns, and I'm so happy to see that the team is moving forward.

482
00:51:39,171 --> 00:51:56,119
[SPEAKER_29]: It brings me to the bigger point, I think that it was easy a few weeks ago to people in higher power to slam this council because they think that what was thought was that we were hurting the kids of the city of Medford.

483
00:51:56,159 --> 00:52:00,721
[SPEAKER_29]: Now, as a father of two kids in that system, that's the furthest from my mind.

484
00:52:00,801 --> 00:52:03,443
[SPEAKER_29]: So I wanted to applaud this council.

485
00:52:04,163 --> 00:52:12,451
[SPEAKER_29]: Because this is our job, whether you like it or not, it's to look at every penny and making sure that we're using it for the right reasons.

486
00:52:12,531 --> 00:52:20,759
[SPEAKER_29]: And look at the time we spent, it's almost been an hour, and we've been talking about, this is just scratching the surface, about what this money can be used for.

487
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:22,801
[SPEAKER_29]: And these questions,

488
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:29,846
[SPEAKER_29]: If not used for the reasons to get our children back in the school for any reason, who would they hold accountable?

489
00:52:29,886 --> 00:52:32,248
[SPEAKER_29]: That would be us, because we would have proved it.

490
00:52:32,308 --> 00:52:45,020
[SPEAKER_29]: So I applaud this council for taking the extra time to make sure that we dotted our I's and crossed our T's to make sure we can get our students and faculty into a safe,

491
00:52:46,021 --> 00:52:54,048
[SPEAKER_29]: We've already heard that delaying it to two weeks didn't have any issues with moving that point forward.

492
00:52:54,108 --> 00:52:56,270
[SPEAKER_29]: So again, I know that

493
00:52:58,990 --> 00:53:03,393
[SPEAKER_29]: It's easy to beat people up, but we need to stay positive.

494
00:53:03,453 --> 00:53:12,738
[SPEAKER_29]: And I think that with the steps you're taking and your team is taking, Superintendent, and Johnny McLaughlin, we're trying to do to get our kids back into a safe, healthy school.

495
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:27,067
[SPEAKER_29]: What this council's doing to make sure any funding we do have goes right to the proper locations, making sure that Alicia Nunley's working with that COVID fund, making sure that we're doing what's right.

496
00:53:27,667 --> 00:53:30,228
[SPEAKER_29]: And I appreciate it, and I thank you.

497
00:53:30,849 --> 00:53:34,730
[SPEAKER_29]: I do want to end just with one thing, some of the, that we have you, Madam Superintendent.

498
00:53:35,951 --> 00:53:41,873
[SPEAKER_29]: The biggest question I'm hearing right now is, please, when will the kids know their schedule?

499
00:53:41,914 --> 00:53:43,394
[SPEAKER_29]: I know they're scheduled to start next week.

500
00:53:44,415 --> 00:53:48,897
[SPEAKER_29]: If you can answer that final question, just to give them an idea, I think it'll be very helpful.

501
00:53:49,157 --> 00:53:49,457
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

502
00:53:50,677 --> 00:53:56,823
[SPEAKER_17]: We did send out the tentative schedule of what their instructional day will look like.

503
00:53:57,564 --> 00:54:03,789
[SPEAKER_17]: We have not sent out at the secondary level, the high school level over the next few days.

504
00:54:05,010 --> 00:54:07,353
[SPEAKER_17]: The student schedules will be sent out.

505
00:54:08,113 --> 00:54:12,597
[SPEAKER_17]: School brings is converting over and with the assignments

506
00:54:13,438 --> 00:54:19,320
[SPEAKER_17]: of teachers and working on the assignments of cohorts, all of that work is taking place right now.

507
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:35,306
[SPEAKER_17]: So under normal conditions, people would have had their schedules in advance, but due to all of the moving pieces that we are currently kind of working with right now, we were not able to create schedules.

508
00:54:35,346 --> 00:54:40,008
[SPEAKER_17]: Had we sent schedules out, the schedules most likely would have ended up having to change.

509
00:54:40,688 --> 00:54:46,052
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's a situation where we are measuring twice in order to cut once.

510
00:54:46,792 --> 00:54:57,259
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I ask the entire community for a little more patience for us to be able to match up the students with the cohorts.

511
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:12,057
[SPEAKER_17]: With the days of the week, with the staffing that's available, with all of the adjustments that had to be made, we were not able to send out the schedule, but that will be completed over the next few days.

512
00:55:13,072 --> 00:55:16,113
[SPEAKER_29]: So again, Madam Superintendent, I thank you.

513
00:55:16,153 --> 00:55:29,757
[SPEAKER_29]: And again, I just urge the community to, it's easy to stand on that soapbox and pound your chest, but let's all have a sense of a community and understand that this is the first time for a lot of communities.

514
00:55:30,277 --> 00:55:34,238
[SPEAKER_29]: And the community I'm working in right now, this is exactly the issues they're going through.

515
00:55:34,899 --> 00:55:36,519
[SPEAKER_29]: And it's been a mess.

516
00:55:36,539 --> 00:55:39,360
[SPEAKER_29]: So we're all working together.

517
00:55:40,743 --> 00:55:42,924
[SPEAKER_29]: We're doing this together for the first time.

518
00:55:43,444 --> 00:55:47,565
[SPEAKER_29]: Let's just stay positive and make sure that we do what's best for our community and our children.

519
00:55:47,885 --> 00:55:48,226
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

520
00:55:48,446 --> 00:55:49,706
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilor Scarapelli.

521
00:55:50,086 --> 00:55:50,866
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Pierce.

522
00:55:51,367 --> 00:55:52,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

523
00:55:52,887 --> 00:55:53,928
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank you, Dr. Vincent.

524
00:55:53,948 --> 00:56:00,150
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you're working with a smaller staff than you were working with last year, I think including the data director, so I know it must be difficult.

525
00:56:01,958 --> 00:56:09,120
[SPEAKER_05]: I spent four years in Medford High School this side of the year 2000, and I can tell you if it was bad before, it's worse now.

526
00:56:09,681 --> 00:56:14,422
[SPEAKER_05]: So I really appreciate the condition that the building is in and the work that needs to happen.

527
00:56:14,442 --> 00:56:17,283
[SPEAKER_05]: I have two quick questions, hopefully.

528
00:56:17,623 --> 00:56:28,787
[SPEAKER_05]: The first one is, has any spending on HVAC repairs or other repairs to, or upgrades to make sure the building, Medford High School, is safe?

529
00:56:28,827 --> 00:56:29,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Have those happened already?

530
00:56:29,828 --> 00:56:30,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Has any spending occurred?

531
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:40,266
[SPEAKER_17]: So John McLaughlin would have to speak specifically to the spending that may have occurred.

532
00:56:42,373 --> 00:56:45,075
[SPEAKER_17]: outside of the reports not coming in yet.

533
00:56:45,776 --> 00:56:56,664
[SPEAKER_17]: So we, again, as we're just getting this information kind of hot off the press, we were waiting for what the reports would reveal so that we could know which way to go.

534
00:56:56,684 --> 00:57:02,008
[SPEAKER_17]: Because a lot of, there's a lot of vendors out there, a lot of people saying, do this, do that.

535
00:57:02,128 --> 00:57:04,930
[SPEAKER_17]: But again, where the high school has its unique

536
00:57:05,810 --> 00:57:06,911
[SPEAKER_17]: It's unique structure.

537
00:57:07,331 --> 00:57:09,032
[SPEAKER_17]: We have classrooms without windows.

538
00:57:09,072 --> 00:57:13,094
[SPEAKER_17]: There are a lot of special parts of the high school.

539
00:57:13,234 --> 00:57:15,875
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, the science wing, which is completely renovated.

540
00:57:16,396 --> 00:57:20,538
[SPEAKER_17]: So we have so many different parts of the building.

541
00:57:20,578 --> 00:57:27,641
[SPEAKER_17]: I know that we had held off waiting for guidance so that we would be able to really make smart decisions.

542
00:57:28,302 --> 00:57:32,824
[SPEAKER_17]: But John McLaughlin could speak to what may have already been spent.

543
00:57:35,224 --> 00:57:37,906
[SPEAKER_11]: John McLaughlin.

544
00:57:37,986 --> 00:57:44,111
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so the money that you appropriated about a year ago, you appropriated, I think it was $325,000.

545
00:57:44,211 --> 00:57:57,720
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to look into doing bathrooms, a generator, repairs to the PA system, and a few other projects.

546
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,502
[SPEAKER_11]: So currently, the bathroom project

547
00:58:00,282 --> 00:58:09,284
[SPEAKER_11]: We had to get an architect in, so I'm awaiting the architect's plans so that we can go through the procurement process and move forward with that.

548
00:58:10,184 --> 00:58:19,647
[SPEAKER_11]: The generator, I'm actually waiting for a price as well to repair that generator or to replace that generator that we had talked about about a year ago.

549
00:58:20,687 --> 00:58:21,948
[SPEAKER_11]: Things are moving slowly.

550
00:58:21,968 --> 00:58:25,991
[SPEAKER_11]: People aren't out and about and around as much as they usually are.

551
00:58:26,352 --> 00:58:26,892
[SPEAKER_11]: But we are.

552
00:58:26,932 --> 00:58:28,093
[SPEAKER_11]: We're still working forward.

553
00:58:28,153 --> 00:58:44,927
[SPEAKER_11]: We're also working with CPA grants to put in new soft surfaces and repair all the equipment, outside playground equipment at the Columbus, in the Brooks, as well as a study that we'll be conducting hopefully shortly about ADA compliance.

554
00:58:46,228 --> 00:58:53,178
[SPEAKER_11]: for the soft surface at the McGlynn area or maybe a redesign for the soft surface play area at the McGlynn.

555
00:58:53,218 --> 00:58:59,267
[SPEAKER_11]: So those projects have been moving forward with them.

556
00:58:59,588 --> 00:59:00,669
[SPEAKER_11]: But as you can imagine,

557
00:59:01,410 --> 00:59:17,648
[SPEAKER_11]: with everything going on it's not as it's not as easy to get the people you know to to come to come into the building and you know the exposure and things of that nature but yeah we're still moving forward and um you know and and and and if you if if you're gracious enough to

558
00:59:18,848 --> 00:59:19,389
[SPEAKER_11]: this money.

559
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:22,770
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to do some good things with it.

560
00:59:23,210 --> 00:59:26,892
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's going to be a win-win for the kids in the community.

561
00:59:27,452 --> 00:59:32,514
[SPEAKER_11]: And yeah, we're going to have to really, really work hard to maintain what we have.

562
00:59:32,614 --> 00:59:35,215
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, we have over a million square feet in the district.

563
00:59:35,955 --> 00:59:44,801
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, there's a lot of moving parts, so we're constantly moving around through the city fixing things that break and as they break.

564
00:59:45,121 --> 00:59:59,090
[SPEAKER_11]: And sometimes we find ourselves running around just putting out little fires and not necessarily doing, you know, some of the other maintenance issues go by the wayside.

565
00:59:59,230 --> 01:00:00,471
[SPEAKER_11]: And unfortunately,

566
01:00:00,931 --> 01:00:11,786
[SPEAKER_11]: Sometimes this is what happens in programs that we want to put computers in kids' hands and run programs.

567
01:00:12,266 --> 01:00:18,455
[SPEAKER_11]: So sometimes building as old as Method High School paid the price, and we're paying for the sins.

568
01:00:19,015 --> 01:00:21,959
[SPEAKER_11]: that have been going on since the 70s now.

569
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:25,223
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's not anybody in particular's fault.

570
01:00:25,303 --> 01:00:30,469
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not somebody's fault because we're doing the best we can.

571
01:00:30,509 --> 01:00:31,791
[SPEAKER_11]: We're trying as hard as we can.

572
01:00:32,972 --> 01:00:36,016
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, every roof fan at Method High School isn't bad.

573
01:00:38,258 --> 01:00:45,825
[SPEAKER_11]: To take the time to diagnose the roof fans, it's easier to replace them all and start off with brand new roof fans.

574
01:00:46,185 --> 01:00:51,029
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't want you to think that it's all bad.

575
01:00:51,489 --> 01:01:01,458
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just that what we're trying to do is make improvements to the whole roof situation and exhaust fans.

576
01:01:02,799 --> 01:01:04,160
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope that answers your question.

577
01:01:05,318 --> 01:01:05,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, John.

578
01:01:05,878 --> 01:01:10,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I appreciate the answer, and I understand the concern of vendors coming into the building.

579
01:01:12,002 --> 01:01:16,725
[SPEAKER_05]: My only other question, well, also I like Dr. Vinson saying that there are special parts of the building.

580
01:01:16,765 --> 01:01:18,526
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that was kind, kind language.

581
01:01:19,427 --> 01:01:21,388
[SPEAKER_05]: My other question is just the timeline.

582
01:01:21,848 --> 01:01:32,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think that these repairs will be completed by the current estimated date where students might be coming back into the building, which I think is mid-October, or would they go past that?

583
01:01:34,073 --> 01:01:48,826
[SPEAKER_17]: So again, because we don't have all of the reports, we know right now that the high school needs significant work and over the next week, by the end of next week, we should have reports regarding the other schools.

584
01:01:49,506 --> 01:01:51,448
[SPEAKER_17]: So again, if it's really,

585
01:01:52,829 --> 01:02:01,971
[SPEAKER_17]: small mitigation that's required in the outside buildings where we, you know, as it is, we're working around the clock, but we will continue to get it done.

586
01:02:02,391 --> 01:02:11,533
[SPEAKER_17]: We want kids back in school as quickly as possible, but we need to ensure that the buildings are safe and meet the appropriate standards.

587
01:02:12,173 --> 01:02:15,053
[SPEAKER_17]: And so we are trying to do it as quickly as possible.

588
01:02:15,073 --> 01:02:18,474
[SPEAKER_17]: We're not taking shortcuts because we do know that this is,

589
01:02:19,114 --> 01:02:21,075
[SPEAKER_17]: everyone's safety and health at risk.

590
01:02:21,255 --> 01:02:26,759
[SPEAKER_17]: So we want it to be done as quickly as possible, but we need it to be done correctly.

591
01:02:27,199 --> 01:02:43,209
[SPEAKER_17]: So as soon as we have the data from the outside engineering reports, we will, you know, go into high gear action to mitigate, you know, and meet whatever it is that they're recommending for us to get our buildings back online as soon as possible.

592
01:02:43,629 --> 01:02:54,562
[SPEAKER_17]: So my hope would definitely be that by October, we would be up and running at all, if not the majority of our buildings.

593
01:02:55,263 --> 01:03:01,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Dr. Vincent, and I appreciate the due diligence and the documentation sent over today and look forward to further documentation.

594
01:03:01,591 --> 01:03:03,453
[SPEAKER_05]: I would move approval of both papers.

595
01:03:04,607 --> 01:03:05,827
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilor Behrs.

596
01:03:06,427 --> 01:03:07,328
[SPEAKER_26]: Vice President Carviello.

597
01:03:07,568 --> 01:03:08,468
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Mr. President.

598
01:03:09,688 --> 01:03:22,992
[SPEAKER_23]: To the chair, to the superintendent, before we install all these HEPA filters in the buildings, is all the ductwork going to be cleaned, the current ductwork going to be cleaned and disinfected?

599
01:03:25,937 --> 01:03:45,894
[SPEAKER_17]: So, I mean, based on what the engineering reports will show to us, I believe as everything's being worked on that everything will be cleaned or made to the appropriate standard, you know, possible because filters need to be added and there are a lot of other recommendations.

600
01:03:45,954 --> 01:03:54,421
[SPEAKER_17]: So in just the natural course of getting the systems up and running, that would need to happen.

601
01:03:56,309 --> 01:04:01,672
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, I mean, I don't want to be putting brand new filters on ductwork that hasn't been cleaned and disaffected.

602
01:04:01,712 --> 01:04:04,053
[SPEAKER_23]: So I think that was the question that I asked.

603
01:04:07,015 --> 01:04:09,957
[SPEAKER_23]: So is that going to happen before we do this?

604
01:04:12,505 --> 01:04:17,571
[SPEAKER_17]: I can't speak to the steps in which, or the order in which it's going to happen.

605
01:04:17,631 --> 01:04:19,473
[SPEAKER_17]: I do know that we do need filters.

606
01:04:20,374 --> 01:04:33,028
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know how the ducts would be sanitized per se, but I would believe that they're going to be putting filters onto the HVAC systems.

607
01:04:33,588 --> 01:04:42,831
[SPEAKER_17]: that they would definitely have to clean it before you put, you know, even when you get your air conditioning serviced at home, they clean it and they put in new filters.

608
01:04:43,471 --> 01:04:56,655
[SPEAKER_17]: So I can't speak to the exact steps because, you know, I'm not, you know, an engineer that can address the, you know, appropriate steps, but I would definitely say that yes, they would have to clean it.

609
01:04:56,695 --> 01:04:57,555
[SPEAKER_17]: You wouldn't want to,

610
01:04:58,834 --> 01:05:08,499
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, once you take out an old filter and you put in a new filter, that they would appropriately clean it before they added the next filter in.

611
01:05:08,959 --> 01:05:25,227
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, I can't, you know, I'm not an HVAC expert, but I, you know, could not see them not taking the appropriate steps to get our system fully functioning based on what the reports are saying to us.

612
01:05:25,870 --> 01:05:38,179
[SPEAKER_23]: I would ask that you make that part of your report to them that these vents be cleaned and disinfected before they come back online.

613
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:41,241
[SPEAKER_17]: No, no, we can definitely do that.

614
01:05:41,341 --> 01:05:49,267
[SPEAKER_17]: That can definitely be part of, once we get to the actual piece to say make sure all

615
01:05:51,933 --> 01:05:55,402
[SPEAKER_17]: and sanitized and before you add the new filters to it.

616
01:05:56,164 --> 01:05:57,006
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you Madam Superintendent.

617
01:06:03,736 --> 01:06:04,676
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you, Mr. President.

618
01:06:04,797 --> 01:06:08,358
[SPEAKER_33]: I was wondering if we, I asked the question earlier, I'm not sure if I got an answer.

619
01:06:09,178 --> 01:06:22,944
[SPEAKER_33]: If the school administration knows how much, or maybe Mr. Rodriguez, how much money is available in the CARES Act and also the COVID funds for safety purposes within our public schools?

620
01:06:26,385 --> 01:06:33,128
[SPEAKER_26]: Would someone like to, would David Murphy or David Rodriguez or Superintendent Edward Vincent have the answer to that?

621
01:06:35,008 --> 01:06:39,538
[SPEAKER_17]: I think Mr. Rodriguez might be able to speak specifically to that.

622
01:06:42,655 --> 01:06:43,715
[SPEAKER_21]: to the council as soon as possible.

623
01:06:43,775 --> 01:06:45,195
[SPEAKER_21]: It was an allocation of $225 per student.

624
01:06:45,235 --> 01:06:46,216
[SPEAKER_21]: directly for mitigation efforts.

625
01:07:10,607 --> 01:07:21,394
[SPEAKER_33]: And Mr. President, I have a question for the superintendent of schools regarding what is the current school policy on the rental of our buildings?

626
01:07:23,655 --> 01:07:31,460
[SPEAKER_17]: So for buildings that are being rented, they have to go and be approved through the Board of Health, first and foremost.

627
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:38,564
[SPEAKER_17]: So at the high school, we do have one of the churches using the high school

628
01:07:40,205 --> 01:07:41,626
[SPEAKER_17]: care and theater, the little theater.

629
01:07:42,487 --> 01:07:50,614
[SPEAKER_17]: And in order for that space to be used, it has to be used at a reduced capacity, which is following the governor's guidance.

630
01:07:51,114 --> 01:08:02,103
[SPEAKER_17]: And in addition to that, the renters had to submit what their COVID-19 protocols would be to the board of health.

631
01:08:02,844 --> 01:08:05,646
[SPEAKER_17]: And so they had to put specific things in place.

632
01:08:05,746 --> 01:08:07,328
[SPEAKER_17]: The custodian sanitized,

633
01:08:07,945 --> 01:08:10,447
[SPEAKER_17]: and clean the spaces before and afterwards.

634
01:08:10,847 --> 01:08:16,872
[SPEAKER_17]: They have one door that's used for an entrance, a separate door that's used for an exit way.

635
01:08:17,412 --> 01:08:27,519
[SPEAKER_17]: So there are safety protocols that are put in place so that traffic, people are not crossing each other and they are maintaining social distancing.

636
01:08:27,940 --> 01:08:29,181
[SPEAKER_17]: They are wearing their masks.

637
01:08:29,701 --> 01:08:37,387
[SPEAKER_17]: So they have to, before anything is approved, it has to, that plan has to be approved through the Board of Health.

638
01:08:38,187 --> 01:08:40,848
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's what the renters are doing.

639
01:08:40,888 --> 01:08:43,829
[SPEAKER_17]: They are meeting the standards that have been set for them.

640
01:08:44,049 --> 01:08:49,111
[SPEAKER_17]: And we as a district, we are sanitizing and cleaning those spaces appropriately.

641
01:08:50,952 --> 01:08:54,793
[SPEAKER_33]: So Madam Superintendent, I am astonished.

642
01:08:55,853 --> 01:09:03,996
[SPEAKER_33]: We're talking about safety and health of our students, our faculty, our teachers, staff within our schools.

643
01:09:04,716 --> 01:09:06,237
[SPEAKER_33]: Why we would introduce

644
01:09:07,601 --> 01:09:16,063
[SPEAKER_33]: hundreds of people that wouldn't necessarily be in our buildings into our buildings through the rental of our buildings.

645
01:09:16,684 --> 01:09:22,925
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's not hundreds of people because the county theater has a capacity of maybe 400.

646
01:09:24,006 --> 01:09:28,367
[SPEAKER_17]: And at any given time, it's probably filled at a quarter capacity.

647
01:09:28,927 --> 01:09:31,549
[SPEAKER_17]: so it is not hundreds of people that are in the building.

648
01:09:32,050 --> 01:09:48,783
[SPEAKER_17]: I also want to state that I have been in the building every single day, along with the custodians, along with the secretaries, along with all of the staff that are physically reporting to work at the high school complex every day, and the building is being cleaned and sanitized.

649
01:09:49,263 --> 01:09:55,508
[SPEAKER_17]: And as a normal citizen, I go to stop and shop, I go to CVS, I practice,

650
01:09:57,349 --> 01:10:11,012
[SPEAKER_17]: proper hygiene in terms of hand-washing, wearing a mask, using hand sanitizer, because we cannot allow the virus to stop us from living and from doing our daily living activities.

651
01:10:11,652 --> 01:10:22,235
[SPEAKER_17]: And if there is fear that any part of the school is going to be rented, then that fear is also going to carry over to students being allowed to come into the building.

652
01:10:22,455 --> 01:10:24,855
[SPEAKER_17]: So we need to be able to...

653
01:10:28,321 --> 01:10:34,466
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you, Mr. President, and I was just trying to finish my thought, and I appreciate the superintendent's response.

654
01:10:34,967 --> 01:10:44,134
[SPEAKER_33]: However, Mr. President, when I say hundreds, I said hundreds, and it's really thousands because it's not the one Saturday or Sunday they're in our building.

655
01:10:44,694 --> 01:10:45,975
[SPEAKER_33]: It's over a course of time.

656
01:10:46,476 --> 01:10:49,178
[SPEAKER_33]: So to sit back and say it's only a couple of hundred,

657
01:10:49,798 --> 01:10:55,223
[SPEAKER_33]: That may be true for one given weekend, Mr. President, or two, but not over the course of the year.

658
01:10:55,283 --> 01:10:59,447
[SPEAKER_33]: It's thousands of people being introduced into our schools.

659
01:11:00,088 --> 01:11:06,013
[SPEAKER_33]: And why subject students, staff, Mr. President, to the additional people coming into the building?

660
01:11:06,494 --> 01:11:12,319
[SPEAKER_33]: And I understand and appreciate there's protocols and procedures, and they have to get signed off from the Board of Health.

661
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:15,040
[SPEAKER_33]: And I can appreciate that, Mr. President.

662
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:23,122
[SPEAKER_33]: But in my opinion, when you have people from outside that are coming into the buildings, you're not sure what precautions they may be taking.

663
01:11:23,442 --> 01:11:29,183
[SPEAKER_33]: They may sign a paper, Mr. President, but when they're in that building, what type of supervision is there?

664
01:11:29,443 --> 01:11:39,865
[SPEAKER_33]: What type of protocols are being put in place to make sure, Mr. President, that our kids, our staff, our teachers are being safe when they enter the building the next day?

665
01:11:41,612 --> 01:11:42,852
[SPEAKER_33]: Why risk it, Mr. President?

666
01:11:43,212 --> 01:11:45,373
[SPEAKER_33]: They're using our buildings, Mr. President.

667
01:11:45,653 --> 01:11:46,953
[SPEAKER_33]: They're using classrooms.

668
01:11:47,713 --> 01:11:49,274
[SPEAKER_33]: They're using cafeterias.

669
01:11:49,774 --> 01:11:51,194
[SPEAKER_33]: They're using gymnasiums.

670
01:11:51,554 --> 01:11:52,834
[SPEAKER_33]: They're using restrooms.

671
01:11:53,154 --> 01:11:54,555
[SPEAKER_33]: They're using auditoriums.

672
01:11:56,135 --> 01:12:10,158
[SPEAKER_33]: Now, you're telling me, Mr. President, that our staff, who are very capable at the high school, are going to make sure that every inch of the high school or the McGlynn School or any other school is sanitized, every inch of the building.

673
01:12:11,653 --> 01:12:14,034
[SPEAKER_33]: I have a tough time believing that, Mr. President.

674
01:12:14,754 --> 01:12:30,938
[SPEAKER_33]: In the interest of safety that we're talking about and health, I would respectfully ask that the school committee look back at their policy and stop the policy of renting the buildings, Mr. President, until we're able to get this situation under hand.

675
01:12:31,358 --> 01:12:34,658
[SPEAKER_33]: I realize it's a revenue source for the schools.

676
01:12:35,038 --> 01:12:38,219
[SPEAKER_33]: I understand that, Mr. President, that we count on.

677
01:12:38,959 --> 01:12:41,060
[SPEAKER_33]: But safety should come first.

678
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:49,725
[SPEAKER_33]: I've heard from a number of parents, a number of faculty members that are concerned about going back into the buildings because of the rentals.

679
01:12:50,814 --> 01:13:04,700
[SPEAKER_33]: So I would respectfully ask the superintendent and the school committee, along with the administration, revisit the policy on renting the buildings, Mr. President, until we can get a better handle on our children going back.

680
01:13:05,061 --> 01:13:13,545
[SPEAKER_33]: The issues that we're going to be confronting, not only with the rentals, Mr. President, but just going back to school in general under a COVID new society.

681
01:13:14,765 --> 01:13:17,246
[SPEAKER_33]: Why compound it with the rentals of the building?

682
01:13:17,546 --> 01:13:19,746
[SPEAKER_33]: It makes zero sense to me.

683
01:13:20,126 --> 01:13:22,286
[SPEAKER_33]: And no one's going to tell me otherwise, Mr. President.

684
01:13:22,827 --> 01:13:23,187
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

685
01:13:23,587 --> 01:13:24,607
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

686
01:13:24,707 --> 01:13:25,487
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Peers.

687
01:13:25,727 --> 01:13:26,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

688
01:13:27,307 --> 01:13:32,909
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think the same logic could be applied to having council meetings and other board and committee meetings at City Hall and City Hall staff.

689
01:13:33,169 --> 01:13:33,509
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

690
01:13:34,269 --> 01:13:35,249
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilor Peers.

691
01:13:37,349 --> 01:13:39,990
[SPEAKER_26]: If I may, John McLaughlin, if you're still with us.

692
01:13:52,982 --> 01:13:53,662
[SPEAKER_27]: John McLaughlin.

693
01:13:58,224 --> 01:13:59,164
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm trying to unmute John.

694
01:14:01,725 --> 01:14:01,985
[SPEAKER_26]: John.

695
01:14:06,347 --> 01:14:06,947
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, sorry.

696
01:14:07,207 --> 01:14:08,048
[SPEAKER_11]: Hold on one second.

697
01:14:08,068 --> 01:14:09,028
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got to get my earplugs.

698
01:14:09,268 --> 01:14:09,668
[SPEAKER_26]: No worries.

699
01:14:13,310 --> 01:14:16,291
[SPEAKER_11]: My daughter's over with a bunch of her friends, so they wanted to get the fire going.

700
01:14:16,311 --> 01:14:16,591
[SPEAKER_11]: I apologize.

701
01:14:16,611 --> 01:14:17,091
[SPEAKER_11]: No worries.

702
01:14:25,915 --> 01:14:27,097
[SPEAKER_27]: Just let me know when you're ready and I'll...

703
01:14:54,488 --> 01:14:55,649
[SPEAKER_11]: John, you can start.

704
01:14:56,489 --> 01:14:56,929
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm on.

705
01:14:57,169 --> 01:14:57,970
[SPEAKER_26]: OK, thank you.

706
01:14:58,770 --> 01:14:59,571
[SPEAKER_26]: So a couple of questions.

707
01:14:59,591 --> 01:15:07,835
[SPEAKER_26]: So with regard to the roof fans, as a past graduate of Medford High School, are you familiar with the complex?

708
01:15:11,137 --> 01:15:14,259
[SPEAKER_27]: Mr. President, could you say that again?

709
01:15:14,339 --> 01:15:19,142
[SPEAKER_26]: As a graduate of Medford High School, I'm very familiar with the complex.

710
01:15:20,042 --> 01:15:22,003
[SPEAKER_26]: So are we replacing all of the roof fans?

711
01:15:24,147 --> 01:15:27,151
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we were intended on replacing them all, yes.

712
01:15:27,672 --> 01:15:38,748
[SPEAKER_11]: We weren't going to get into diagnostics because we figured it would be more of an expense and it would be easier if we just went up there and replaced them all.

713
01:15:39,688 --> 01:15:42,369
[SPEAKER_26]: So when you replace the fans, are you cutting into the roof?

714
01:15:42,609 --> 01:15:43,549
[SPEAKER_26]: Or how does that work?

715
01:15:43,609 --> 01:15:44,549
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't mean to get into that.

716
01:15:44,589 --> 01:15:44,889
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, no.

717
01:15:45,669 --> 01:15:49,190
[SPEAKER_11]: You unhook the fan that's currently there and replace it with another one.

718
01:15:49,230 --> 01:15:50,811
[SPEAKER_11]: No, you would not be cutting on the roof.

719
01:15:50,831 --> 01:15:50,891
[SPEAKER_26]: OK.

720
01:15:50,971 --> 01:15:56,072
[SPEAKER_26]: I was just curious as far as I know, like when I was in the school committee, and we always had roof issues.

721
01:15:56,112 --> 01:15:59,813
[SPEAKER_26]: So I just didn't want to solve one problem but create another.

722
01:16:00,073 --> 01:16:01,913
[SPEAKER_26]: So that's what my question was going there.

723
01:16:02,993 --> 01:16:03,494
[SPEAKER_11]: Nope.

724
01:16:03,874 --> 01:16:05,214
[SPEAKER_11]: It wouldn't do that at all.

725
01:16:05,254 --> 01:16:07,034
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just replacing existing motors.

726
01:16:09,892 --> 01:16:11,535
[SPEAKER_11]: in hoods that are up there currently.

727
01:16:11,956 --> 01:16:13,919
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, thank you very much.

728
01:16:14,259 --> 01:16:15,902
[SPEAKER_26]: Are there any other questions from the council?

729
01:16:16,726 --> 01:16:28,276
[SPEAKER_33]: Mr. President, I would respectfully ask if the superintendent, I know she was trying to answer my questions and comments, if she can finish with her statement.

730
01:16:28,517 --> 01:16:41,068
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, Superintendent Ron Vinson, I'm sorry I didn't cut you off, but Councilor Marks had the floor, so if you could please continue with your comments, I'd greatly appreciate it.

731
01:16:43,091 --> 01:16:47,854
[SPEAKER_17]: And so essentially the comments that I was making were in regards to the rentals.

732
01:16:48,714 --> 01:16:59,741
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think Councilor Beers made the equally valid point of saying that the chambers and City Hall are also used for other events.

733
01:17:00,381 --> 01:17:04,143
[SPEAKER_17]: I do feel that we need to get students back into school.

734
01:17:04,704 --> 01:17:06,785
[SPEAKER_17]: We need to use good judgment.

735
01:17:07,345 --> 01:17:11,307
[SPEAKER_17]: When our buildings are rented, we have security on hand.

736
01:17:11,727 --> 01:17:16,629
[SPEAKER_17]: We have our custodians who get to work on the weekends and get overtime.

737
01:17:17,109 --> 01:17:26,453
[SPEAKER_17]: So we have custodians who are ready, willing to clean and sanitize and follow the COVID procedures that we have in place.

738
01:17:27,233 --> 01:17:32,835
[SPEAKER_17]: And yes, if we're renting a space, people do need to use the facilities from time to time.

739
01:17:32,956 --> 01:17:36,377
[SPEAKER_17]: So the bathrooms will be cleaned and sanitized as well.

740
01:17:37,297 --> 01:17:54,129
[SPEAKER_17]: The school committee did vote that we can rent our building spaces and work with some of the partners that we've had for a long time, provided they meet the standards that the Board of Health has put before them.

741
01:17:54,469 --> 01:18:03,155
[SPEAKER_17]: And so all of those that are using any of our buildings, they've met those standards, and that's why they've been able to use this space.

742
01:18:04,055 --> 01:18:05,196
[SPEAKER_17]: Those are my final remarks.

743
01:18:08,132 --> 01:18:09,212
[SPEAKER_26]: Any other questions from the council?

744
01:18:10,593 --> 01:18:27,317
[SPEAKER_33]: Mr. President, I just want to go on record that I disagree 100% with the rental of our buildings during this particular phase of COVID-19 based on the health and safety of our students, our faculties, our administrators, our teachers, and everyone else within our buildings, Mr. President.

745
01:18:27,977 --> 01:18:34,319
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

746
01:18:34,699 --> 01:18:36,200
[SPEAKER_24]: Is the Board of Health Director on the call?

747
01:18:36,260 --> 01:18:36,860
[SPEAKER_24]: Is she still here?

748
01:18:38,192 --> 01:18:40,173
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't think so, but I could be wrong.

749
01:18:45,697 --> 01:18:49,340
[SPEAKER_29]: While you're looking, I think it's very important that Councilman Marks brings up a good point.

750
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:55,724
[SPEAKER_29]: The difference between having meetings here, this is our job.

751
01:18:56,465 --> 01:19:02,369
[SPEAKER_29]: This is open for the community to get things done, whether it's voting, whether it's councils, city school committee meetings.

752
01:19:03,305 --> 01:19:06,906
[SPEAKER_29]: What Council Marks, I believe, is bringing up is an option.

753
01:19:07,206 --> 01:19:21,711
[SPEAKER_29]: We have options whether to keep those schools closed and making sure that we're taking our precautions to the total responsibility that we have to make sure they're safe and clean.

754
01:19:22,431 --> 01:19:26,292
[SPEAKER_29]: The difference of having people in this building, this is where we do the people's work.

755
01:19:27,734 --> 01:19:39,839
[SPEAKER_29]: Not to rent for a outside church group that's not even from Medford, or whether it's from Medford or not, or whether it's an athletic program or a dance or whatnot.

756
01:19:40,359 --> 01:19:53,845
[SPEAKER_29]: These are things that, what I'd like to ask the health director, and I'll do that via email if she's not on, is I'd like the protocol that she used to allow 400 people to enter our schools.

757
01:19:54,778 --> 01:20:01,603
[SPEAKER_29]: But then limit this body to close the doors for the people that want to come to a podium.

758
01:20:02,904 --> 01:20:09,830
[SPEAKER_29]: So everybody here in this room, everybody in this room, they've been putting themselves out there.

759
01:20:10,911 --> 01:20:13,453
[SPEAKER_29]: They're shopping in supermarkets.

760
01:20:13,773 --> 01:20:15,054
[SPEAKER_29]: They're handing out ballots.

761
01:20:15,554 --> 01:20:19,117
[SPEAKER_29]: They're coming to these meetings.

762
01:20:19,978 --> 01:20:21,119
[SPEAKER_29]: So we know.

763
01:20:22,977 --> 01:20:25,239
[SPEAKER_29]: That if that's the case, this building should be open.

764
01:20:25,299 --> 01:20:31,925
[SPEAKER_29]: So this is going to be interesting to see what our Board of Health Director is going to answer these questions, because I, too, agree with Councilor Mox.

765
01:20:32,966 --> 01:20:35,308
[SPEAKER_29]: The job that's done in this room is the business.

766
01:20:35,948 --> 01:20:40,592
[SPEAKER_29]: The job that's going outside in those schools right now, that's for profit.

767
01:20:41,093 --> 01:20:43,495
[SPEAKER_29]: And I don't think that's the equivalent for safety.

768
01:20:43,995 --> 01:20:44,436
[SPEAKER_29]: I just don't.

769
01:20:45,184 --> 01:20:45,524
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

770
01:20:45,944 --> 01:20:46,845
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Scott.

771
01:20:46,865 --> 01:20:47,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Kelly, Councilor Morrell.

772
01:20:48,186 --> 01:20:48,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

773
01:20:49,006 --> 01:20:52,528
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I don't really think this is the appropriate forum to debate signs at this point.

774
01:20:52,568 --> 01:20:53,789
[SPEAKER_07]: I move approval of both papers.

775
01:20:54,409 --> 01:20:54,849
[SPEAKER_28]: Second.

776
01:20:57,191 --> 01:20:58,251
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Nonson, what's the motion?

777
01:20:58,592 --> 01:20:59,772
[SPEAKER_07]: I move approval of both papers.

778
01:21:00,132 --> 01:21:00,793
[SPEAKER_05]: And I second.

779
01:21:01,613 --> 01:21:01,973
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

780
01:21:02,093 --> 01:21:06,556
[SPEAKER_26]: I think, Clerk Cardavis, did you mention that there was someone wanted to comment on this?

781
01:21:09,638 --> 01:21:12,379
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. President, Sean Beaman from 362 Lawrence Road.

782
01:21:14,194 --> 01:21:15,675
[SPEAKER_22]: the city has the following question.

783
01:21:15,735 --> 01:21:23,177
[SPEAKER_22]: Has anyone asked the teachers union whether, if this contemplated HVAC work is completed at the high school, will the teachers return to the building?

784
01:21:23,557 --> 01:21:24,998
[SPEAKER_22]: Has the union made that commitment?

785
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:42,523
I think what I would say in response is that the work that we're undertaking to ensure that our infrastructure

786
01:21:46,397 --> 01:21:58,305
[SPEAKER_18]: or exceeds the safety standards being set by public health officials has been a significant part of the dialogue, ongoing dialogue that we have with all of our collective bargaining partners.

787
01:21:58,926 --> 01:22:09,193
[SPEAKER_18]: I didn't want to speak for them and certainly wouldn't want to make any representations as to what they have communicated in the course of those negotiations, but I would say that we

788
01:22:12,057 --> 01:22:15,838
[SPEAKER_18]: studies and the analysis that is part of what we've been talking about here tonight.

789
01:22:16,358 --> 01:22:24,940
[SPEAKER_18]: The various engineering firms that we've retained have been an important part of the conversations that we're having with our bargaining partners.

790
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:34,481
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think that the one point that we've made throughout the course of our discussions with teachers and the other unions is that we recognize that the advocacy for

791
01:22:41,175 --> 01:22:49,501
[SPEAKER_18]: on behalf of safety, certainly recognize the importance of getting students into school and continuing their education process as early as possible.

792
01:22:49,881 --> 01:22:58,207
[SPEAKER_18]: And those advocating for people for having in-person learning recognize that safety is a basic entitlement that everyone who enters the school should expect.

793
01:22:58,247 --> 01:23:10,435
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think that we're trying to keep that dialogue as constructive as possible and recognizing the value from what may seem like inflicting points of view is something that's always important to remember.

794
01:23:11,875 --> 01:23:12,355
[SPEAKER_29]: Mr. President.

795
01:23:12,535 --> 01:23:12,895
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

796
01:23:13,076 --> 01:23:14,076
[SPEAKER_29]: Counselor Scott Kelly.

797
01:23:14,276 --> 01:23:25,041
[SPEAKER_29]: If I can, I did have discussions with the union president, and I think they're waiting for the word on the air quality test as well.

798
01:23:25,121 --> 01:23:33,846
[SPEAKER_29]: So I think everybody's on the same page, but I believe they haven't heard back from the administration about any of the results, and I think we're still waiting for those.

799
01:23:33,906 --> 01:23:39,288
[SPEAKER_29]: So I think that once that's done, I think we'll have a better understanding what the teachers union

800
01:23:41,029 --> 01:23:49,497
[SPEAKER_29]: And I think that for the discussions I've had with different teachers, if they get those assurances, I'm sure they want to get back to school too.

801
01:23:49,537 --> 01:23:52,759
[SPEAKER_29]: So I've talked to many of them and they want to get back to the classroom.

802
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:53,840
[SPEAKER_29]: So thank you.

01:23:59,165 --> 01:24:01,166

807
01:24:02,067 --> 01:24:09,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome aboard, Assistant Superintendent Murphy, and thank him for going through his initiation this evening as his first appearance before the Memphis City Council.

808
01:24:09,992 --> 01:24:14,415
[SPEAKER_04]: I do look forward to meeting him in a less formal setting, and I wish him all the best in his new endeavor.

01:24:44,590 --> 01:24:46,172
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. Clerk, Councilor Marks.

820
01:24:47,053 --> 01:25:01,788
[SPEAKER_32]: This vote includes that the school administration will provide us with a list of priorities and recommendations as soon as we get them from engineering reports, correct?

821
01:25:01,828 --> 01:25:02,569
[SPEAKER_26]: What's the amendment?

822
01:25:02,589 --> 01:25:04,691
[SPEAKER_26]: Can you please read the amendment?

823
01:25:06,353 --> 01:25:08,813
[SPEAKER_22]: Council night's amendment was to use the farm.

824
01:25:08,993 --> 01:25:15,055
[SPEAKER_22]: It was to allow the schools to use the funds across the school district, not just at the high school.

825
01:25:15,955 --> 01:25:17,095
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, was that the only amendment?

826
01:25:19,155 --> 01:25:20,235
[SPEAKER_22]: That is the only thing.

827
01:25:20,836 --> 01:25:25,756
[SPEAKER_22]: Vice President Carabiello asked for a list of improvements to be made, but he didn't offer in the form of an amendment.

828
01:25:25,776 --> 01:25:30,877
[SPEAKER_03]: I will second it.

829
01:25:31,117 --> 01:25:32,498
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, let's see.

830
01:25:32,538 --> 01:25:34,558
[SPEAKER_26]: So if we could make that in the form of an amendment, please.

831
01:25:35,574 --> 01:25:36,595
[SPEAKER_32]: That would be fine.

832
01:25:36,635 --> 01:25:42,419
[SPEAKER_32]: That's similar to the superintendent stating that she would honor that amendment.

833
01:25:42,459 --> 01:25:45,161
[SPEAKER_32]: So I would vote that.

834
01:25:45,181 --> 01:25:47,063
[SPEAKER_26]: I didn't get that last amendment from Council Mars.

835
01:25:47,964 --> 01:25:48,944
[SPEAKER_26]: Let's see.

836
01:25:48,984 --> 01:25:52,447
[SPEAKER_26]: The last amendment was from, I believe, Vice President Caviello.

837
01:25:53,027 --> 01:25:53,508
[SPEAKER_26]: OK.

838
01:25:53,668 --> 01:25:57,010
[SPEAKER_22]: So Vice President Caviello's request for a list was an amendment, OK?

839
01:25:59,452 --> 01:25:59,692
[SPEAKER_26]: OK.

840
01:25:59,732 --> 01:26:00,553
[SPEAKER_26]: Do you have that?

841
01:26:01,214 --> 01:26:01,814
[SPEAKER_26]: I have it, yes.

842
01:26:01,934 --> 01:26:02,895
[SPEAKER_27]: OK, perfect.

843
01:26:02,915 --> 01:26:03,555
[SPEAKER_26]: So on the motion of?

844
01:26:04,965 --> 01:26:09,888
[SPEAKER_26]: Vice President Caviello, seconded by Councilor Behrs as amended by Councilors Knight and Councilors Marks.

845
01:26:10,628 --> 01:26:12,569
[SPEAKER_26]: Clerk Artemis, please call the roll.

846
01:26:12,589 --> 01:26:16,531
[SPEAKER_22]: Was it Councilor Marks or Vice President Caviello who just made the last amendment?

847
01:26:16,551 --> 01:26:19,513
[SPEAKER_04]: They were co-sponsors of the amendment and I moved to second them all.

848

[SPEAKER_26]: Vice President Caviello.

849
01:26:22,314 --> 01:26:22,715
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

954
01:31:34,472 --> 01:31:34,532
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

955
01:31:49,505 --> 01:31:50,265
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Scarpelli.

956
01:31:50,365 --> 01:31:50,685
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

957
01:31:50,705 --> 01:31:52,006
[SPEAKER_22]: Rosario Falco.

958
01:31:52,166 --> 01:31:52,446
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

959
01:31:52,466 --> 01:31:54,426
[SPEAKER_26]: 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

960
01:31:54,666 --> 01:31:56,246
[SPEAKER_26]: The motion of the paper is tabled.

961
01:31:56,466 --> 01:31:58,687
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, while we're under suspension.

962
01:31:59,047 --> 01:32:05,408
[SPEAKER_26]: On the motion of Councilor Marks to revert to the regular order of business, seconded by Vice President Carviello, Clerk Hernandez, please call the roll.

963
01:32:07,529 --> 01:32:08,149
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Behrs.

964
01:32:08,789 --> 01:32:09,029
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

965
01:32:10,069 --> 01:32:11,010
[SPEAKER_22]: Vice President Carviello.

966
01:32:11,570 --> 01:32:11,830
Yes.

967
01:32:12,610 --> 01:32:13,150
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Knight.

968
01:32:13,430 --> 01:32:13,670
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

969
01:32:14,390 --> 01:32:15,030
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Marks.

970
01:32:15,090 --> 01:32:15,411
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

971
01:32:16,431 --> 01:32:17,071
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Morrell.

972
01:32:17,351 --> 01:32:17,571
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

973
01:32:18,575 --> 01:32:19,355
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Scarpelli?

974
01:32:19,475 --> 01:32:19,776
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

975
01:32:20,356 --> 01:32:21,116
[SPEAKER_22]: President Fevella?

976
01:32:22,117 --> 01:32:22,357
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

977
01:32:22,377 --> 01:32:24,198
[SPEAKER_26]: 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

978
01:32:24,218 --> 01:32:26,439
[SPEAKER_26]: The motion passes 2-0-526.

979
01:32:26,879 --> 01:32:43,208
[SPEAKER_26]: Under motions, orders, and resolutions offered by Councilor Knight, we have resolved that the Memphis Historic Commission furnish the city council with copies of its annual report filed with the mayor as required by section 48-33 of the code of Memphis ordinances compiled for the years 2016 through 2019.

980
01:32:43,248 --> 01:32:43,848
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Knight?

981
01:32:47,140 --> 01:32:48,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

982
01:32:48,421 --> 01:32:51,322
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is a rather self-explanatory resolution.

983
01:32:52,022 --> 01:32:55,884
[SPEAKER_04]: However, the reason that it's being filed is not so self-explanatory.

984
01:32:56,805 --> 01:33:02,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Here in our community now, I've never served on the council at a time where I've gotten more calls.

985
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:08,642
[SPEAKER_04]: about permits being delayed, demolition delays, and the like, Mr. President.

986
01:33:09,262 --> 01:33:16,865
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd like to take a review of the annual reports as required by the Historical Commission to be filed with the administration to take a look at what's going on.

987
01:33:18,146 --> 01:33:22,087
[SPEAKER_04]: My brief research on this topic has shown me, Mr. President, that since 2009,

988
01:33:23,628 --> 01:33:31,292
[SPEAKER_04]: There have been over 50 plus cases where demolition delay has been implemented in the community, but only four homes have not been demolished during this time.

989
01:33:31,432 --> 01:33:33,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Four buildings, I should say, not even homes, buildings.

990
01:33:33,413 --> 01:33:34,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Four buildings have not been demolished.

991
01:33:38,222 --> 01:33:41,205
[SPEAKER_04]: the success rate is minimal, is minimal at this point in time.

992
01:33:42,406 --> 01:33:46,991
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have a number of questions like, have these four homes been restored or did they just not get demolished?

993
01:33:47,731 --> 01:33:56,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Were they restored to a historic state or were they left there to just be the same way that they were before they were deemed to be historically significant or preferentially preserved?

994
01:33:57,480 --> 01:34:02,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Do these 50 plus cases include applicants who are delayed and withdrew their appeal?

995
01:34:04,166 --> 01:34:07,007
[SPEAKER_04]: the 18 month or the six month period was up at the time, Mr. President.

996
01:34:09,607 --> 01:34:22,450
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm getting a lot of pushback and a lot of phone calls about people who feel as though the demolition delay is being used as a weapon against them for not complying with certain requirements and certain things that are being demanded of them.

997
01:34:23,671 --> 01:34:26,651
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's starting to become very problematic, Mr. President.

998
01:34:26,731 --> 01:34:33,453
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reason I say it's problematic is because when we look at what's going on in this community right now, when we look at our financial situation here in this community,

999
01:34:33,973 --> 01:34:40,256
[SPEAKER_04]: If we don't embrace development in the very near future, I'm going to say we don't have the ability to meet our payroll next year.

1000
01:34:42,076 --> 01:34:48,919
[SPEAKER_04]: For the past five years, we've generated at least $1.5 million in new growth in this community.

1001
01:34:49,640 --> 01:34:55,542
[SPEAKER_04]: And that $1.5 million is necessary for us to just meet the contractual obligations of our payroll.

1002
01:34:56,602 --> 01:35:02,705
[SPEAKER_04]: This fiscal year, we've estimated our new growth to be at $1 million, not $1.5 million as it has been for the past five years.

1003
01:35:04,293 --> 01:35:12,080
[SPEAKER_04]: This coupled with the fact that we have certain sectors of our economy that we need to bring back, like the restaurant industry and the hotel industry.

1004
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:18,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Because those sectors allow us to raise additional revenues here for the community, Mr. President.

1005
01:35:18,845 --> 01:35:23,349
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we've done a great job in expanding the offerings that we have for outdoor dining in the community.

1006
01:35:23,609 --> 01:35:27,512
[SPEAKER_04]: And we need to do that because the meals tax is a benefit.

1007
01:35:28,354 --> 01:35:31,556
[SPEAKER_04]: that we get when our restaurants do well.

1008
01:35:32,076 --> 01:35:33,636
[SPEAKER_04]: And the same goes for our hotels.

1009
01:35:33,797 --> 01:35:36,978
[SPEAKER_04]: If hotels are being turned over, we get a tax on that, Mr. President.

1010
01:35:37,518 --> 01:35:51,365
[SPEAKER_04]: And right now, with one in five adults out of work, 20% unemployment across the commonwealth, I think it's important for us to look down the line a little bit at what the financial situation is going to be in this community.

1011
01:35:52,045 --> 01:35:57,348
[SPEAKER_04]: And unless we start embracing development, generating permitting fees and new growth, we're not going to be

1012
01:35:58,148 --> 01:36:02,149
[SPEAKER_04]: in a strong financial position come this time next year.

1013
01:36:03,590 --> 01:36:08,091
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of this, I think, surrounds some of the work that's being done relative to demolition delay.

1014
01:36:08,491 --> 01:36:13,753
[SPEAKER_04]: And now the next layer of that, which is going to be if you want a permit for basic

1015
01:36:14,807 --> 01:36:25,072
[SPEAKER_04]: repairs or modifications to your home, you're also going to have to go before that other layer of bureaucracy and potentially be subject to an 18 month delay in the issuance of your permit.

1016
01:36:25,573 --> 01:36:27,153
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's a problem, Mr. President.

1017
01:36:27,393 --> 01:36:31,335
[SPEAKER_04]: So I raise this issue because we've asked for a committee of the whole on this months and months ago.

1018
01:36:31,395 --> 01:36:32,036
[SPEAKER_04]: It hasn't happened.

1019
01:36:32,056 --> 01:36:33,016
[SPEAKER_04]: We've asked for reports.

1020
01:36:34,377 --> 01:36:35,097
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't gotten them.

1021
01:36:37,078 --> 01:36:37,819
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't gotten them.

1022
01:36:38,614 --> 01:36:45,240
[SPEAKER_04]: So here I am looking at this saying, what can we do in this community to help dig us out of this economic crisis?

1023
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:47,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, one of those things we can do is develop wisely.

1024
01:36:49,303 --> 01:36:53,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Another thing we can do is generate permitting fees through development that's going to bolster.

1025
01:36:56,680 --> 01:37:05,743
[SPEAKER_04]: When we sat down and we talked about the budget, the biggest thing we talked about was the $2.4 million deficit in forecasted permitting fees out of the building department.

1026
01:37:06,143 --> 01:37:08,004
[SPEAKER_04]: And how are we going to climb out of this hole?

1027
01:37:09,164 --> 01:37:14,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I can tell you by making people who want to invest in our community jump through hoops for 18 months.

1028
01:37:16,962 --> 01:37:27,104
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not going to do anything to jumpstart our economics, that's not going to do anything to generate more permitting fees, and that's not going to do anything to put us in a better economic and financial situation here in the community.

1029
01:37:28,905 --> 01:37:33,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Preserving historic homes is important, but I think we're going a bit too far at this point now, Mr. President.

1030
01:37:34,106 --> 01:37:39,367
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're going a bit too far, and I think we really need to look at it, because quite frankly,

1031
01:37:40,587 --> 01:37:53,131
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have someone that wants to do a development in this community and they're subject to the demolition delay, the next thing that happens is the historical commission presents itself as a design review board.

1032
01:37:53,692 --> 01:37:57,313
[SPEAKER_03]: That says, well, show us your designs and if we like them, then we'll let you move forward.

1033
01:37:58,673 --> 01:38:03,815
[SPEAKER_03]: But nothing's to say that the designs that they show the historic commission are going to be approved by the ZBA.

1034
01:38:04,615 --> 01:38:08,537
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have a situation where we have someone that's looking to invest money in this community.

1035
01:38:09,946 --> 01:38:22,872
[SPEAKER_04]: who could be held up for 18 months at historic and then have to go through the whole process of the ZBA where they may or may not ever, ever get an approval for any design that they're seeking to implement in this community if variance is needed.

1036
01:38:23,733 --> 01:38:28,655
[SPEAKER_04]: I just think that it's very unfair, Mr. President, and rule number one in government for me has always been do no harm.

1037
01:38:29,615 --> 01:38:32,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Do no harm, rule number one in government.

1038
01:38:32,377 --> 01:38:33,857
[SPEAKER_04]: We had to help people, not hurt people.

1039
01:38:34,678 --> 01:38:38,700
[SPEAKER_04]: And when someone comes into the community and buys a parcel and wants to knock it down,

1040
01:38:39,927 --> 01:38:42,713
[SPEAKER_04]: And when they buy the parcel, the home's just a junky home.

1041
01:38:43,153 --> 01:38:46,039
[SPEAKER_04]: And when they want to knock it down, it becomes historically significant.

1042
01:38:46,420 --> 01:38:48,504
[SPEAKER_04]: And they've invested $750,000, $600,000, their life savings into these parcels.

1043
01:38:52,865 --> 01:39:00,350
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a life changing decision that's being made by a board or a commission that can harm these individuals.

1044
01:39:00,931 --> 01:39:11,578
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's very important, Mr. President, that we revisit the criteria, the circumstances, and the processes that we have in place when it comes down to the demolition delay or portions thereof.

1045
01:39:12,179 --> 01:39:13,700
[SPEAKER_04]: We spoke about it several weeks ago.

1046
01:39:14,320 --> 01:39:16,982
[SPEAKER_04]: And we called for a need for a committee of the whole on this.

1047
01:39:17,523 --> 01:39:20,165
[SPEAKER_04]: And I ask that it be scheduled sooner rather than later.

1048
01:39:20,526 --> 01:39:22,707
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reason I ask is because people are being hurt.

1049
01:39:23,488 --> 01:39:26,010
[SPEAKER_04]: People are being hurt financially in their pocket.

1050
01:39:28,132 --> 01:39:34,278
[SPEAKER_04]: When one in five adults in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts are unemployed and people are coming to Medford looking to invest money.

1051
01:39:35,559 --> 01:39:38,703
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we should embrace them and work with them, not against them, Mr. President.

1052
01:39:39,183 --> 01:39:46,531
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that being said, I ask for these reports to be issued and furnished to the council so that I can review them further and prepare myself for a committee of the whole, which is going to be scheduled.

1053
01:39:46,832 --> 01:39:49,094
[SPEAKER_04]: I have faith and confidence that it's going to get done, Mr. President.

1054
01:39:49,114 --> 01:39:52,458
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we're working under very strange circumstances these days.

1055
01:39:52,498 --> 01:39:53,899
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like I'm at the zoo right now.

1056
01:39:57,303 --> 01:39:59,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Zoo, circus, the case could be made for either.

1057
01:40:00,646 --> 01:40:17,223
[SPEAKER_04]: But with that being said, Mr. President, I ask my council colleagues to support this resolution to get this information so that when we do have this further discussion and this further dialogue, we're all well informed as to what goes on, what the process is, and what the pros and cons of our ordinance is right now and how it affects people.

1058
01:40:17,984 --> 01:40:20,667
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that being said, I ask my council colleagues to support the resolution.

1059
01:40:21,473 --> 01:40:22,213
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Council Knight.

1060
01:40:22,353 --> 01:40:37,320
[SPEAKER_26]: And Jeff, I may add really quick, that Committee of the Whole will be scheduled soon, as will, I'm working on the scheduling now for that, for rodents and for our big zoning meeting.

1061
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:39,841
[SPEAKER_26]: So I can assure you that will be coming soon.

1062
01:40:39,881 --> 01:40:41,202
[SPEAKER_02]: Both equally important issues, Mr. President.

1063
01:40:41,262 --> 01:40:44,663
[SPEAKER_26]: Absolutely, so they're all on the agenda and they'll all be coming up soon.

1064
01:40:45,224 --> 01:40:46,124
[SPEAKER_26]: So thank you, Council Knight.

1065
01:40:46,844 --> 01:40:50,106
[SPEAKER_26]: And let's see, we have Councilor, Vice President Caviello.

1066
01:40:50,366 --> 01:40:51,207
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1067
01:40:52,228 --> 01:40:55,112
[SPEAKER_23]: Councilman Knox, I'm sorry, Councilman Nutt is 100% right.

1068
01:40:56,914 --> 01:41:03,102
[SPEAKER_23]: We'll make it through this year with what we have, but next year is going to be a very trying year for us.

1069
01:41:03,923 --> 01:41:07,247
[SPEAKER_23]: Monies that we've normally had in the past aren't going to be coming in.

1070
01:41:08,442 --> 01:41:11,024
[SPEAKER_23]: restaurants, sales, all these little things.

1071
01:41:11,104 --> 01:41:16,207
[SPEAKER_23]: And your building department generates millions of dollars in building permits for the city.

1072
01:41:16,827 --> 01:41:27,193
[SPEAKER_23]: Like it or not, development is a necessary part of the growth of a community, no matter what kind.

1073
01:41:27,573 --> 01:41:28,174
[SPEAKER_23]: And here we are.

1074
01:41:30,375 --> 01:41:34,538
[SPEAKER_23]: We're stunting growth in this community, even on these small projects.

1075
01:41:34,558 --> 01:41:40,181
[SPEAKER_23]: So again, I support Councilor Knight on this, and I'll second the motion from this.

1076
01:41:40,201 --> 01:41:49,087
[SPEAKER_23]: But again, we have to look for ways to generate money for this community, and we can't be chasing people away from this community.

1077
01:41:49,367 --> 01:41:50,988
[SPEAKER_23]: So we need to start embracing some things.

1078
01:41:51,789 --> 01:41:52,449
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1079
01:41:54,630 --> 01:41:55,751
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Vice President Cabrera.

1080
01:41:55,791 --> 01:41:56,972
[SPEAKER_26]: Point of information, Councilor Knight.

1081
01:41:59,329 --> 01:42:06,975
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not talking about developers, Mr. President, like Locust Street or like Moderna or Mill Creek.

1082
01:42:07,295 --> 01:42:09,777
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm talking about the local builder.

1083
01:42:10,417 --> 01:42:15,701
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm talking about someone that wants to come in and make an investment in the community, someone that's going to maybe renovate a home.

1084
01:42:16,502 --> 01:42:18,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe come in and do an addition to a house.

1085
01:42:18,764 --> 01:42:21,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe someone that's going to come in and knock down a parcel that's

1086
01:42:22,543 --> 01:42:29,611
[SPEAKER_04]: a single family home in an apartment two district and create a tax base for us with an apartment there that complies with the existing zoning.

1087
01:42:29,931 --> 01:42:31,332
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I'm talking about, Mr. President.

1088
01:42:31,352 --> 01:42:38,840
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not talking about these big wig developers that are coming in here from Boston that are just going to throw millions and millions of dollars away.

1089
01:42:39,201 --> 01:42:42,504
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm talking about builders that have a very small margin.

1090
01:42:43,285 --> 01:42:50,249
[SPEAKER_04]: And if they're tied up for eight, nine, or ten months and it costs them $80,000 to $100,000, they have a very difficult time surviving.

1091
01:42:50,829 --> 01:42:57,172
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you look at these small builders, you also have to understand that they probably employ between 50 and 60 people.

1092
01:42:58,373 --> 01:43:08,738
[SPEAKER_04]: 50 and 60 people that are going to be doing a job in this community, that are going to have the opportunity to spend their money in our local business districts for lunch.

1093
01:43:10,395 --> 01:43:16,276
[SPEAKER_04]: in our gas stations to gas up their cars, in our local hardware stores to pick up supplies.

1094
01:43:17,157 --> 01:43:20,337
[SPEAKER_04]: So it all goes to the circular flow of our economy, Mr. President.

1095
01:43:20,357 --> 01:43:26,339
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think it's very important that we look at this, and I know that we have a number of items on the agenda, and I don't want to go any longer than I already have.

1096
01:43:26,399 --> 01:43:27,219
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you very much.

1097
01:43:27,419 --> 01:43:28,199
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1098
01:43:28,239 --> 01:43:29,460
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Morrell.

1099
01:43:31,843 --> 01:43:31,903
[SPEAKER_07]: you.

1100
01:43:31,923 --> 01:43:32,803
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mister President.

1101
01:43:32,823 --> 01:43:34,324
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I want just to address one point.

1102
01:43:34,344 --> 01:43:41,346
[SPEAKER_07]: I know there are a number of things that were maybe misrepresented in that in those talking points that were actually addressed in this large packet.

1103
01:43:41,386 --> 01:43:48,928
[SPEAKER_07]: We got this this week, but I do just want to point out the fact that to your own calculations to counsel night's own calculations that over 11

1104
01:43:54,310 --> 01:43:56,952
[SPEAKER_07]: 50 homes over 11 years, that's about five homes a year.

1105
01:43:57,472 --> 01:43:59,573
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to address the scare tactics being used in that.

1106
01:43:59,613 --> 01:44:05,096
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think that's exactly millions of dollars that have been lost because of a demo delay at five homes a year.

1107
01:44:05,376 --> 01:44:05,756
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1108
01:44:05,936 --> 01:44:06,817
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilor Orell.

1109
01:44:08,238 --> 01:44:10,459
[SPEAKER_26]: Point of information, Councilor Knight.

1110
01:44:10,499 --> 01:44:12,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a scare tactic, a fact.

1111
01:44:12,720 --> 01:44:16,302
[SPEAKER_04]: There were 50 plus homes that have gone through the demolition delay and only four were saved.

1112
01:44:16,462 --> 01:44:17,402
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not a scare tactic.

1113
01:44:17,743 --> 01:44:18,223
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the truth.

1114
01:44:18,263 --> 01:44:21,685
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the facts that were included in the packet that were given to us by the

1115
01:44:22,812 --> 01:44:24,112
[SPEAKER_04]: Medford Historic District Commission.

1116
01:44:25,233 --> 01:44:28,994
[SPEAKER_04]: And it came in the packet this evening, even though we've asked for it, I can't tell you how many months ago.

1117
01:44:29,434 --> 01:44:34,075
[SPEAKER_04]: And the packet that it came in this evening is unrelated to the council request that came back previously.

1118
01:44:34,595 --> 01:44:36,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a scare tactic, Mr. President, just a fact.

1119
01:44:37,676 --> 01:44:38,416
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilman.

1120
01:44:43,557 --> 01:44:45,238
[SPEAKER_26]: Any other questions or comments from the council?

1121
01:44:45,358 --> 01:44:49,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I've had my hand up since we started, so just FYI.

1122
01:44:51,448 --> 01:44:53,169
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, a few things here.

1123
01:44:53,369 --> 01:44:57,492
[SPEAKER_05]: So one, I don't disagree that bringing in revenue is important.

1124
01:44:58,173 --> 01:45:06,238
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a little dangerous to be making land use and development decisions primarily on how they affect city revenue, although I do agree it's an important decision.

1125
01:45:06,819 --> 01:45:09,841
[SPEAKER_05]: I think more importantly, though, is the larger question of process.

1126
01:45:10,661 --> 01:45:19,428
[SPEAKER_05]: Last week, I helped a family work through the we've had this thing where now the building department is correctly

1127
01:45:20,448 --> 01:45:27,091
[SPEAKER_05]: going through and making sure that the Historical Commission has at least seen permits when they go out and they've built a new online system to do just that.

1128
01:45:27,651 --> 01:45:33,953
[SPEAKER_05]: I helped a family last week who was having an issue with the delay and quite frankly the delay isn't from the Historical Commission.

1129
01:45:34,234 --> 01:45:36,194
[SPEAKER_05]: The issue has been in the building department.

1130
01:45:36,474 --> 01:45:39,876
[SPEAKER_05]: A permit was issued and then the building department said,

1131
01:45:40,616 --> 01:45:41,857
[SPEAKER_05]: hold on a minute, we need to check.

1132
01:45:42,698 --> 01:45:49,745
[SPEAKER_05]: And then five days later, I made a couple calls, the building department sent it over to the historical commission, and that day, the historical commission brought it back.

1133
01:45:49,865 --> 01:45:52,608
[SPEAKER_05]: So these permits are sitting for days in the building department.

1134
01:45:52,668 --> 01:45:58,154
[SPEAKER_05]: The historical commission, when they get them, is turning them out the same day, if possible, and most of the time.

1135
01:45:58,234 --> 01:46:00,856
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I just think we need to allow

1136
01:46:01,597 --> 01:46:14,139
[SPEAKER_05]: or encourage the building department to accelerate the work, make sure they have the resources they need, as is well taken the amount of permits that are happening, make sure they have the resources to process them and get them over.

1137
01:46:14,299 --> 01:46:17,440
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think the blockage here is the historical commission.

1138
01:46:17,920 --> 01:46:28,262
[SPEAKER_05]: And quite frankly, if you've driven down West Street, you can see the travesty that's happened on West Street, where a historical home has been turned into a monstrosity, and there's no new units.

1139
01:46:28,722 --> 01:46:29,822
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still a single family home.

1140
01:46:29,882 --> 01:46:31,803
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just giant and takes up the lot now.

1141
01:46:32,043 --> 01:46:33,703
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, it's due diligence.

1142
01:46:34,824 --> 01:46:37,044
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think the historical commission is the problem here.

1143
01:46:37,304 --> 01:46:41,545
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we can accelerate this process in the building department, get everything over, I think we'll be just fine.

1144
01:46:41,565 --> 01:46:44,486
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe we can avoid some of this stuff like what's happening over on West Street.

1145
01:46:44,666 --> 01:46:45,566
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1146
01:46:45,846 --> 01:46:47,887
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilor.

1147
01:46:48,367 --> 01:46:48,947
[SPEAKER_26]: One minute, Councilor.

1148
01:46:51,046 --> 01:46:51,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

1149
01:46:51,726 --> 01:46:54,587
[SPEAKER_04]: I certainly support the councilor's position to accelerate the process.

1150
01:46:54,607 --> 01:46:59,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that's why we need to look at whether or not an 18-month delay is appropriate or whether it should be reverted back to six.

1151
01:47:00,108 --> 01:47:00,888
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1152
01:47:01,008 --> 01:47:01,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President.

1153
01:47:02,989 --> 01:47:05,609
[SPEAKER_26]: We have Councilor Morrell, and then we'll Councilor Morrell.

1154
01:47:05,749 --> 01:47:14,832
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Mr. President, if I could just draw attention to rule number 17 of the council, just upon debatable merits, a councilor shall speak no more than three times or more than 15 minutes on a single issue.

1155
01:47:14,872 --> 01:47:19,553
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's something that gets railroaded on this council often, and I just want to highlight that.

1156
01:47:19,933 --> 01:47:20,213
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1157
01:47:20,837 --> 01:47:22,378
[SPEAKER_04]: She'll make a motion for the chair to make a ruling.

1158
01:47:23,960 --> 01:47:24,800
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Council Member.

1159
01:47:24,820 --> 01:47:26,241
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Pierce.

1160
01:47:26,261 --> 01:47:27,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1161
01:47:27,122 --> 01:47:30,105
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I don't think the issue here is the length of the demo delay.

1162
01:47:30,565 --> 01:47:33,307
[SPEAKER_05]: There's hundreds, if not thousands, of permits issued in this city.

1163
01:47:33,668 --> 01:47:40,073
[SPEAKER_05]: There's 50 over 10 years that have been subject to demo delay, and four have not been demoed, which, in my opinion, is a net benefit to the city.

1164
01:47:40,733 --> 01:47:46,278
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, I think the issue is making sure the building department has the resources to make sure this process moves well.

1165
01:47:46,298 --> 01:47:47,659
[SPEAKER_05]: I think people are doing good work.

1166
01:47:49,727 --> 01:47:54,630
[SPEAKER_05]: the assertion that the historical commission's functioning as a design review board is really reflective of the work they're doing.

1167
01:47:54,650 --> 01:47:56,511
[SPEAKER_05]: They're taking a quick look.

1168
01:47:56,831 --> 01:48:01,394
[SPEAKER_05]: And 99% of the time, everything is moving through the process.

1169
01:48:01,574 --> 01:48:07,277
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think, you know, if we can get resources to the building department to make sure that process moves quickly, that's something we should do.

1170
01:48:07,858 --> 01:48:08,658
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1171
01:48:08,678 --> 01:48:09,559
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilman Piers.

1172
01:48:10,159 --> 01:48:12,460
[SPEAKER_26]: Let's see, we have Thompson, are you all set?

1173
01:48:12,840 --> 01:48:13,761
[SPEAKER_03]: I am, Mr. President.

1174
01:48:14,161 --> 01:48:15,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a request for information.

1175
01:48:15,809 --> 01:48:16,689
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilman Knight.

1176
01:48:17,310 --> 01:48:19,031
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, we have enough people that want to speak on this.

1177
01:48:21,572 --> 01:48:25,474
[SPEAKER_26]: Cheryl R., let's see, I'm going to try to unmute you.

1178
01:48:30,237 --> 01:48:32,718
[SPEAKER_26]: Cheryl, may I ask you to name and address for the record, please?

1179
01:48:34,350 --> 01:48:37,591
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street.

1180
01:48:37,671 --> 01:48:44,093
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to clarify that the goal of the demo delay is not necessarily to stop demolition, so it's not failing.

1181
01:48:44,613 --> 01:48:57,558
[SPEAKER_13]: The length was increased to 18 months because we had a particular developer in the city who was refusing to engage with the historic mission because the time was short enough that it was profitable enough for him to just ignore them and wait it out.

1182
01:48:57,758 --> 01:49:03,600
[SPEAKER_13]: The 18-month period is rarely, if ever, used to its entirety, but it is an encouragement for the

1183
01:49:04,380 --> 01:49:05,661
[SPEAKER_13]: to be redirected to rezoning.

1184
01:49:24,119 --> 01:49:28,360
[SPEAKER_13]: waiting to be further blighted to increase their odds of gaining variances in the future.

1185
01:49:28,720 --> 01:49:37,843
[SPEAKER_13]: Perhaps you could focus on having some fees to prevent these types of developers from leaving these parcels intentionally empty to increase their profit margins in the future.

1186
01:49:37,863 --> 01:49:44,625
[SPEAKER_13]: This could immediately add money to the city of Medford coppers to be used in the way that Mr. Knight would like to have them.

1187
01:49:45,245 --> 01:49:47,067
[SPEAKER_13]: The sale for flippers is misguided.

1188
01:49:47,147 --> 01:49:49,690
[SPEAKER_13]: It's being quickly used to price out residents.

1189
01:49:50,050 --> 01:49:53,594
[SPEAKER_13]: These homes that are being purchased are not all in knock-down condition.

1190
01:49:53,714 --> 01:50:01,623
[SPEAKER_13]: They are being purchased by flippers because the parcels the homes sit on are large enough for them to squeeze in an additional home on the property.

1191
01:50:01,763 --> 01:50:06,948
[SPEAKER_13]: So they're being purchased for spec rather than to be used by end residents.

1192
01:50:07,729 --> 01:50:09,391
[SPEAKER_13]: This is not about the home condition.

1193
01:50:09,731 --> 01:50:16,298
[SPEAKER_13]: Every flip increases the assessments in those neighborhoods, which are increasing the cost for all of those who live around them.

1194
01:50:16,999 --> 01:50:22,645
[SPEAKER_13]: I welcome you to also embrace looking at assessments across the city, because there are some neighborhoods

1195
01:50:23,346 --> 01:50:46,625
[SPEAKER_13]: that are being, seeing their assessment jump by leaps and bounds, but despite the fact that our homes are not increasing in value at these rates, but are being increased based on the comps from the flips, there are neighborhoods that are not seeing their assessments jump to this level, and those people seem to think they're paying not enough taxes, and I completely agree with them.

1196
01:50:47,166 --> 01:50:50,468
[SPEAKER_13]: So please call for an assessment review in the city so that we can

1197
01:50:52,199 --> 01:50:58,163
[SPEAKER_13]: to realize that not everyone's house is worth what the flip next door is saying it is.

1198
01:50:58,263 --> 01:50:59,043
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Cheryl.

1199
01:50:59,824 --> 01:51:01,304
[SPEAKER_26]: Point of information, Councilman Knight.

1200
01:51:02,765 --> 01:51:13,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, I do believe statutorily, underneath the Department of Revenue, we are required to do real valuation every, I believe it's eight years, a defined period of eight years, every eight years we do a

1201
01:51:14,137 --> 01:51:14,998
[SPEAKER_04]: It's 05 is it now?

1202
01:51:15,058 --> 01:51:15,860
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I might have changed it.

1203
01:51:15,880 --> 01:51:28,258
[SPEAKER_04]: So we actually do have a team that goes out into the community and does assessments, real assessments based upon appraisals as required by the Department of Revenue and in compliance thereof.

1204
01:51:29,433 --> 01:51:30,234
[SPEAKER_13]: you are correct.

1205
01:51:30,815 --> 01:51:42,848
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm happy to send you some, a few addresses that you can compare to mine and see that my assessment has jumped by a couple of hundred thousand dollars and Maryland's nowhere near that.

1206
01:51:43,509 --> 01:51:48,415
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's not being done evenly applied across the city, which is why I asked for an audit.

1207
01:51:49,652 --> 01:51:50,052
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1208
01:51:50,172 --> 01:51:50,753
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Cheryl.

1209
01:51:51,634 --> 01:51:55,657
[SPEAKER_26]: Let me, I just want to remind everybody you have a minute and a half when you speak or have your question.

1210
01:51:56,398 --> 01:52:01,302
[SPEAKER_26]: I will now call upon, let's see, Will Navar?

1211
01:52:01,322 --> 01:52:01,963
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm sorry.

1212
01:52:06,483 --> 01:52:20,212
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, President Falco, William Navarro, 108 Medford Street, apartment B. I think it's really, the canonical example here, we have a single-family home turned into a bigger single-family home.

1213
01:52:21,713 --> 01:52:29,218
[SPEAKER_12]: The original single-family home was unaffordable to ordinary working people, and the new single-family home was unaffordable to working people.

1214
01:52:29,918 --> 01:52:35,539
[SPEAKER_12]: So I consider that a net, not very much at all, other than I guess we get some more revenue.

1215
01:52:35,959 --> 01:52:38,020
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think it's important to look at the zoning.

1216
01:52:38,040 --> 01:52:49,903
[SPEAKER_12]: Make sure maybe when we do that, you see these lots, they seem fairly underdeveloped because you see the land value has gone up insane amounts because City of Boston is a very desirable place to live and work.

1217
01:52:51,423 --> 01:52:58,871
[SPEAKER_12]: And the house, it's just unlikely you have a $350,000 lot with a $200,000 building on it.

1218
01:52:59,651 --> 01:53:01,733
[SPEAKER_12]: I just don't think that makes a lot of sense.

1219
01:53:01,773 --> 01:53:08,080
[SPEAKER_12]: But ideally, rather than just build a massive single family home, we could build a duplex, triplex, tripledecker, something like that.

1220
01:53:09,241 --> 01:53:15,666
[SPEAKER_12]: And as for Miss Rodriguez's point about Mystic Avenue, she talked about a fee.

1221
01:53:16,107 --> 01:53:22,892
[SPEAKER_12]: I would say, before we talk about a fee for leaving property blighted, let's just stop giving a discount to blighted property.

1222
01:53:23,293 --> 01:53:27,236
[SPEAKER_12]: You put up a nice building, your taxes go up, you tear it down, your taxes go down.

1223
01:53:27,596 --> 01:53:28,597
[SPEAKER_12]: Why do we do it that way?

1224
01:53:28,637 --> 01:53:29,578
[SPEAKER_12]: It makes no sense.

1225
01:53:30,258 --> 01:53:35,863
[SPEAKER_12]: Tradition is the answer, but it's not solving problems here or really anywhere.

1226
01:53:36,243 --> 01:53:48,153
[SPEAKER_12]: So I hope we can take a look at that and about the zoning so that way we can, you know, zone so that families can sort of share the expensive land value by living in a duplex, triplex kind of thing.

1227
01:53:48,173 --> 01:53:49,154
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1228
01:53:49,414 --> 01:53:49,975
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Will.

1229
01:53:52,277 --> 01:53:52,657
[SPEAKER_26]: Let's see.

1230
01:53:52,717 --> 01:53:58,883
[SPEAKER_26]: Next up is Kelly Catalo.

1231
01:53:58,923 --> 01:54:00,124
[SPEAKER_26]: Name and address for the record, please.

1232
01:54:04,372 --> 01:54:05,213
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying that

1233
01:54:24,073 --> 01:54:25,154
[SPEAKER_00]: this is not just about the 18

1234
01:54:40,567 --> 01:54:46,011
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we can get everybody to the same meaning we can come up with some great resolutions that benefit everybody.

1235
01:54:46,371 --> 01:54:46,751
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1236
01:54:46,791 --> 01:54:47,052
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1237
01:55:04,377 --> 01:55:05,638
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think it's a growing

1238
01:55:24,352 --> 01:55:46,274
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to echo my fellow residents, Cheryl and William's comments about the exacerbated change in values when developers and flippers take a parcel and take a single or a two-family and make mansions where those were, further eroding our housing affordability within the city.

1239
01:55:47,116 --> 01:55:55,042
[SPEAKER_14]: And I want to just point out, when we say investing in a community, it's far more than dollars invested in a community.

1240
01:55:55,062 --> 01:55:59,626
[SPEAKER_14]: You can be highly invested in a community and not invest a penny.

1241
01:55:59,986 --> 01:56:07,532
[SPEAKER_14]: We have many people who advocate in this city, and they are investing in ways other than knocking down a house and putting up a new one.

1242
01:56:07,552 --> 01:56:11,315
[SPEAKER_14]: These developers are not investing in our community.

1243
01:56:11,655 --> 01:56:15,799
[SPEAKER_14]: They are investing in their projects, and they are doing it repeatedly.

1244
01:56:16,299 --> 01:56:17,562
[SPEAKER_14]: lather, rinse, repeat.

1245
01:56:18,123 --> 01:56:20,147
[SPEAKER_14]: Madcalf, Walnut, Thomas,

1246
01:56:20,580 --> 01:56:31,850
[SPEAKER_14]: Forest Street, Park Street, Court Street, Washington Street, Pleasant Street, Winthrop Street, Bower Street, South Street, just off the top of my head, the same thing over and over.

1247
01:56:32,370 --> 01:56:37,054
[SPEAKER_14]: Buy it for less than 500, sell one part of it for over seven.

1248
01:56:37,415 --> 01:56:43,921
[SPEAKER_14]: That does nothing to create housing affordability and everything to make these people a lot of money.

1249
01:56:44,521 --> 01:56:47,764
[SPEAKER_14]: And the gigantic holes in our zoning

1250
01:56:48,164 --> 01:56:50,866
[SPEAKER_14]: and loopholes in our zoning perpetuate this.

1251
01:56:51,266 --> 01:57:06,734
[SPEAKER_14]: I would urge you, urge you to take on your primary responsibility of zoning review and zoning reform that creates purposeful development, that creates the things that are important to our community and does in fact invest in our community.

1252
01:57:06,954 --> 01:57:08,415
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you so much for your time.

1253
01:57:10,516 --> 01:57:10,796
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1254
01:57:10,936 --> 01:57:16,819
[SPEAKER_26]: And our zoning kickoff meeting will be coming up on September 23rd, just to let everyone know.

1255
01:57:18,169 --> 01:57:19,410
[SPEAKER_26]: Next up, we have Ryan Haywood.

1256
01:57:19,490 --> 01:57:21,892
[SPEAKER_26]: Ryan, I'm about to unmute you.

1257
01:57:21,912 --> 01:57:25,255
[SPEAKER_26]: If you could please have your name and address for the record, please.

1258
01:57:25,275 --> 01:57:26,716
[SPEAKER_26]: You have a minute and a half.

1259
01:57:29,818 --> 01:57:30,078
[SPEAKER_26]: Ryan.

1260
01:57:38,925 --> 01:57:39,406
[SPEAKER_26]: Ryan Haywood?

1261
01:57:39,426 --> 01:57:46,811
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, we'll skip over Ryan.

1262
01:57:48,533 --> 01:57:50,777
[SPEAKER_26]: Clerk Carter Beach, you said someone wanted to speak, I believe.

1263
01:57:52,961 --> 01:57:53,963
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. President, that's correct.

1264
01:57:54,203 --> 01:57:56,187
[SPEAKER_22]: Paul Thumbel asked to speak.

1265
01:58:10,033 --> 01:58:13,375
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, thanks for giving me a second here.

1266
01:58:13,555 --> 01:58:16,957
[SPEAKER_20]: I just wanted to kind of lend a unique combination.

1267
01:58:17,017 --> 01:58:21,899
[SPEAKER_20]: And I spoke earlier this summer, if you don't recognize me, I had the huge beard last time some of you saw me.

1268
01:58:23,360 --> 01:58:24,761
[SPEAKER_20]: I have a good combination.

1269
01:58:24,841 --> 01:58:25,781
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm a local resident.

1270
01:58:25,921 --> 01:58:26,942
[SPEAKER_20]: I live on Douglas Road.

1271
01:58:27,362 --> 01:58:29,203
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm a small business owner.

1272
01:58:29,583 --> 01:58:30,964
[SPEAKER_20]: My wife is a builder.

1273
01:58:31,124 --> 01:58:33,245
[SPEAKER_20]: She comes from the architecture design world.

1274
01:58:34,005 --> 01:58:36,587
[SPEAKER_20]: So we are a small business owner in Medford and we,

1275
01:58:37,707 --> 01:58:43,349
[SPEAKER_20]: on a very small scale are developing and building one or two projects in the Medford area a year.

1276
01:58:43,989 --> 01:58:53,492
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm also a tenured professor in the Business School of Northeastern, so I can kind of address, I see the vision of the economic impact that Councilor Knight had brought up.

1277
01:58:54,452 --> 01:59:05,680
[SPEAKER_20]: And I know as a small business, we keep talking about these big developers, but as a small builder who lives and works in Medford, I quite literally invest my family's life savings every time we do a project.

1278
01:59:10,346 --> 01:59:12,688
[SPEAKER_20]: The historical commission is a huge part of our city.

1279
01:59:12,728 --> 01:59:16,451
[SPEAKER_20]: I think in a different life, I would have been a history professor instead of a business professor.

1280
01:59:17,431 --> 01:59:18,612
[SPEAKER_20]: I love history.

1281
01:59:18,712 --> 01:59:22,055
[SPEAKER_20]: We strive in every project we do to save as much as we can.

1282
01:59:22,095 --> 01:59:25,337
[SPEAKER_20]: We have an obligation as a city to protect our history.

1283
01:59:27,677 --> 01:59:33,802
[SPEAKER_20]: And I logged in today to talk about a project that's getting debated later in the call today.

1284
01:59:34,242 --> 01:59:38,026
[SPEAKER_20]: But I can tell you the economic impact that one of my small projects has.

1285
01:59:40,167 --> 01:59:45,572
[SPEAKER_20]: I hire 10 to 12 subs, subcontractors, sub-small business owners themselves.

1286
01:59:46,012 --> 01:59:48,554
[SPEAKER_20]: So we're talking council nice numbers is conservative.

1287
01:59:49,815 --> 01:59:53,638
[SPEAKER_20]: 50, 60, 70 people come on my projects, and that's just a small project.

1288
01:59:54,879 --> 01:59:58,562
[SPEAKER_20]: Tens of thousands of dollars in permit fees for my small projects.

1289
02:00:00,043 --> 02:00:05,187
[SPEAKER_20]: And so all of my employees, when they go out for lunch, they're eating in Medford Square.

1290
02:00:05,287 --> 02:00:07,188
[SPEAKER_20]: They're loving the Tanakh.

1291
02:00:07,208 --> 02:00:08,329
[SPEAKER_20]: They're loving the Goldilocks.

1292
02:00:08,929 --> 02:00:10,050
[SPEAKER_20]: They are shopping local.

1293
02:00:10,390 --> 02:00:11,651
[SPEAKER_20]: They're eating local every day.

1294
02:00:14,293 --> 02:00:25,859
[SPEAKER_20]: The economic impact for me, if the Historical Commission can put my projects on hold for 18 months, could potentially bankrupt a small business owner like me.

1295
02:00:26,259 --> 02:00:34,303
[SPEAKER_20]: I cannot afford, at $5,000 to $8,000 a month, to wait for a potential hold to come through.

1296
02:00:34,363 --> 02:00:39,565
[SPEAKER_20]: If we get a full 18-month review, you're talking over $100,000 in financial impact.

1297
02:00:40,145 --> 02:00:40,886
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm one person.

1298
02:00:40,906 --> 02:00:42,066
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't have $100,000 to sit on.

1299
02:00:43,547 --> 02:00:44,467
[SPEAKER_26]: Paul, your time is up.

1300
02:00:44,587 --> 02:00:44,967
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1301
02:00:44,987 --> 02:00:46,648
[SPEAKER_26]: I apologize for interrupting.

1302
02:00:46,668 --> 02:00:53,190
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm not sure what happened to Paul.

1303
02:00:56,031 --> 02:01:09,435
[SPEAKER_26]: Ryan Haywood was up next, but I. Ryan Haywood, name and address for the record.

1304
02:01:12,559 --> 02:01:25,743
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to point out to the City Council and just let everybody know here that we are, as a commission, taking note of everything that's being said.

1305
02:01:26,323 --> 02:01:29,665
[SPEAKER_09]: We do want to be helpful, and we want to get you guys the information that you need.

1306
02:01:29,705 --> 02:01:32,785
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll be sure to send you over the information as soon as we can get it to you.

1307
02:01:41,962 --> 02:01:43,143
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Night, seconded by?

1308
02:01:43,743 --> 02:01:44,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

1309
02:01:44,584 --> 02:01:46,586
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Beers, Clerk Urnaby, please call the roll.

1310
02:01:52,731 --> 02:01:53,451
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Beers?

1311
02:01:53,571 --> 02:01:53,872
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1312
02:01:54,672 --> 02:01:55,553
[SPEAKER_22]: Vice President Caraballo?

1313
02:01:55,853 --> 02:01:56,074
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1314
02:01:57,515 --> 02:01:58,075
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Night?

1315
02:01:58,235 --> 02:01:58,636
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1316
02:01:59,736 --> 02:02:00,397
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Marks?

1317
02:02:00,757 --> 02:02:00,957
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1318
02:02:01,838 --> 02:02:02,439
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Morrell?

1319
02:02:02,459 --> 02:02:02,519
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1320
02:02:08,805 --> 02:02:09,085
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1321
02:02:10,326 --> 02:02:11,147
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Morales, a yes?

1322
02:02:11,407 --> 02:02:11,627
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1323
02:02:12,467 --> 02:02:13,268
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1324
02:02:13,368 --> 02:02:13,688
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1325
02:02:13,708 --> 02:02:15,189
[SPEAKER_22]: President Falco?

1326
02:02:15,349 --> 02:02:15,630
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

1327
02:02:15,650 --> 02:02:17,991
[SPEAKER_26]: 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

1328
02:02:18,011 --> 02:02:18,952
[SPEAKER_26]: The motion passes.

1329
02:02:18,972 --> 02:02:29,619
[SPEAKER_26]: 20-527 offered by Council night be it resolved that the Memphis City Council extend its deepest and sincere condolences to the family of Edward Tyrantz on his recent passing.

1330
02:02:30,702 --> 02:02:31,662
[SPEAKER_26]: Counselor Knight.

1331
02:02:31,922 --> 02:02:33,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1332
02:02:33,343 --> 02:02:36,004
[SPEAKER_04]: It's with deep sadness that I offer this resolution this evening.

1333
02:02:36,784 --> 02:02:40,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Eddie Terrence was a kid, I grew up with him, West Medford.

1334
02:02:40,085 --> 02:02:42,006
[SPEAKER_04]: A West Medford fixture, a West Medford legend.

1335
02:02:43,426 --> 02:02:49,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Had the opportunity of going to elementary school with Eddie, high school with Eddie, and always hanging out with him down the park.

1336
02:02:50,376 --> 02:02:57,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether it be placed in a park or dug a park, playing basketball, everywhere in between, causing havoc, riding our bikes and the such, Mr. President.

1337
02:02:57,439 --> 02:03:04,543
[SPEAKER_04]: But Eddie passed away unexpectedly just over the last couple of weeks with a little heart problem, a little heart trouble.

1338
02:03:05,083 --> 02:03:06,583
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's no longer with us.

1339
02:03:06,884 --> 02:03:10,725
[SPEAKER_04]: And Eddie was the type of kid that made everybody around him just better.

1340
02:03:11,826 --> 02:03:13,186
[SPEAKER_04]: When Eddie was there, he put you in a better mood.

1341
02:03:13,347 --> 02:03:18,289
[SPEAKER_04]: He had a smile that could light up a room and a personality that could make the shyest person the most friendly person in the world.

1342
02:03:19,569 --> 02:03:25,672
[SPEAKER_04]: A long time husband to Donna Doherty, CJ Doherty and Chuck Doherty's daughter and sister.

1343
02:03:26,572 --> 02:03:29,253
[SPEAKER_04]: And just an all around great kid, Mr. President.

1344
02:03:29,773 --> 02:03:33,055
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm very sad to see him go and it's one of those.

1345
02:03:34,007 --> 02:03:37,348
[SPEAKER_04]: situations where when someone's gone, you wish you had the opportunity to spend more time with them.

1346
02:03:37,588 --> 02:03:44,491
[SPEAKER_04]: And Eddie was one of those kids, and I don't think there's anybody that knows Eddie that could say right now that they wish they didn't spend more time with him now that he's gone.

1347
02:03:45,312 --> 02:03:51,154
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in offering an offerings of condolences.

1348
02:03:51,734 --> 02:03:56,940
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very unfortunate turn of events.

1349
02:03:57,501 --> 02:04:02,406
[SPEAKER_04]: I was on social media the other day and someone posted a picture.

1350
02:04:03,187 --> 02:04:05,590
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was a picture right across the hall in the mayor's office.

1351
02:04:06,190 --> 02:04:11,276
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was Eddie sitting down in Mayor McGlynn's chair with Mayor McGlynn next to him.

1352
02:04:12,203 --> 02:04:17,725
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a kid named Cedric Taylor sitting next to Eddie, who's no longer with us as well, and Justin Springer.

1353
02:04:18,445 --> 02:04:29,069
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we think back to a couple months ago, this council just recognized Justin Springer for the work that he's done in the city of Boston, doing outreach and communications work with the less fortunate.

1354
02:04:30,149 --> 02:04:39,993
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's very sad, Mr. President, when you reach a certain age and you see a picture like that of kids you grew up with in elementary school and in junior high and in high school, and two out of three of them are gone, they're no longer with us.

1355
02:04:40,893 --> 02:04:44,076
[SPEAKER_04]: So it just saddens me to see that he's gone, because like I said, he's a great person.

1356
02:04:44,096 --> 02:04:51,502
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd ask my council colleagues to join me in supporting the family and offering this condolence to the family in this time of need.

1357
02:04:52,342 --> 02:04:53,223
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1358
02:04:53,343 --> 02:04:54,224
[SPEAKER_26]: At this point, I'd ask.

1359
02:04:55,764 --> 02:04:58,165
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, let's see, Councilor Marks.

1360
02:04:58,665 --> 02:05:01,627
[SPEAKER_33]: I want to thank Councilor Knight for putting this on.

1361
02:05:02,288 --> 02:05:10,052
[SPEAKER_33]: Those who knew Ed knew he was a great person and good person to be around and he will sorely be missed, Mr. President.

1362
02:05:10,673 --> 02:05:16,857
[SPEAKER_33]: I also would like to mention we lost a resident just recently, Giovanni Puccio.

1363
02:05:18,457 --> 02:05:27,102
[SPEAKER_33]: On his recent passing, Mr. President, he was a tremendous father, husband, family man, and just a terrific guy.

1364
02:05:27,802 --> 02:05:30,364
[SPEAKER_33]: And he will be solely missed, Mr. President, as well.

1365
02:05:30,724 --> 02:05:34,426
[SPEAKER_33]: So I'd ask if my council colleague wouldn't mind putting that on as well, Mr. President.

1366
02:05:34,446 --> 02:05:35,466
[SPEAKER_33]: Mr. President.

1367
02:05:35,807 --> 02:05:36,287
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1368
02:05:37,467 --> 02:05:39,368
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Marks, thank you.

1369
02:05:40,049 --> 02:05:43,270
[SPEAKER_26]: And that will be added to the resolution as well as an amendment.

1370
02:05:45,863 --> 02:05:49,484
[SPEAKER_29]: I'd like to thank Councilman Knight for bringing this up.

1371
02:05:50,244 --> 02:06:02,488
[SPEAKER_29]: What a great young man and working for Method Recreation and the boys at Duggar Park and Eddie's family and friends.

1372
02:06:02,548 --> 02:06:04,309
[SPEAKER_29]: I know how important he was to everybody.

1373
02:06:04,989 --> 02:06:06,750
[SPEAKER_29]: And just a great, great young man.

1374
02:06:06,830 --> 02:06:11,491
[SPEAKER_29]: So my prayers to his family and our condolences.

1375
02:06:11,571 --> 02:06:15,211
[SPEAKER_29]: And I appreciate Councilor Mox bringing up Mr. Puccio's name.

1376
02:06:15,711 --> 02:06:19,972
[SPEAKER_29]: I know that it's tough when you don't have week after week meeting and people pass on in between.

1377
02:06:20,032 --> 02:06:25,234
[SPEAKER_29]: So this has been very difficult, but what a great person, left a great legacy.

1378
02:06:27,114 --> 02:06:35,801
[SPEAKER_29]: His kids are committed, they're men and women that are committed to our community and making sure that they're giving back.

1379
02:06:35,881 --> 02:06:42,567
[SPEAKER_29]: And that's because he instilled that sense of community, and I think that he'll solely be missed.

1380
02:06:42,587 --> 02:06:45,549
[SPEAKER_29]: So my condolences to the Puccio family too, so thank you.

1381
02:06:46,330 --> 02:06:47,431
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1382
02:06:50,153 --> 02:06:53,335
[SPEAKER_26]: Let's see, so we will have a moment of silence in one second.

1383
02:06:53,895 --> 02:06:55,476
[SPEAKER_26]: We just have to vote on this first.

1384
02:06:55,516 --> 02:07:02,820
[SPEAKER_26]: So on the motion of Councilor Knight, as amended by Councilor Marks, and seconded by... Second.

1385
02:07:04,361 --> 02:07:05,261
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Scott Kelly.

1386
02:07:07,162 --> 02:07:08,463
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Morrell, did you want to speak on this?

1387
02:07:08,643 --> 02:07:09,764
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I was just getting my mic ready.

1388
02:07:09,824 --> 02:07:10,364
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

1389
02:07:11,164 --> 02:07:11,364
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

1390
02:07:13,446 --> 02:07:16,247
[SPEAKER_26]: So on that motion, Clerk Hutterby, please call the roll.

1391
02:07:18,975 --> 02:07:19,215
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1392
02:07:20,476 --> 02:07:21,396
[SPEAKER_22]: Vice President Caravaglia.

1393
02:07:21,717 --> 02:07:21,957
[SPEAKER_30]: Yes.

1394
02:07:22,857 --> 02:07:23,418
[SPEAKER_22]: Council Knight.

1395
02:07:23,598 --> 02:07:23,898
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1396
02:07:24,578 --> 02:07:25,159
[SPEAKER_22]: Council Marks.

1397
02:07:25,519 --> 02:07:25,819
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1398
02:07:26,439 --> 02:07:27,080
[SPEAKER_22]: Council Morrell.

1399
02:07:27,360 --> 02:07:27,620
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1400
02:07:28,401 --> 02:07:29,221
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1401
02:07:29,301 --> 02:07:29,561
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1402
02:07:30,202 --> 02:07:30,942
[SPEAKER_22]: President Falco.

1403
02:07:31,262 --> 02:07:31,522
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

1404
02:07:32,363 --> 02:07:34,764
[SPEAKER_26]: On the 7 to 0 vote, the motion passes.

1405
02:07:35,825 --> 02:07:38,787
[SPEAKER_26]: Our thoughts and prayers are with the Tyrantz and Puccio families.

1406
02:07:39,127 --> 02:07:42,389
[SPEAKER_26]: At this point in time, I'd ask everyone to please rise for a brief moment of silence.

1407
02:08:12,955 --> 02:08:14,896
[SPEAKER_26]: 20-528 offered by Councilor Knight.

1408
02:08:15,116 --> 02:08:30,500
[SPEAKER_26]: Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council recognize the efforts of the community partner Armstrong Ambulance, most notably Gail Armstrong, Richard Armstrong, and Sean Mangan, for their contributions toward the success of the August 18th and 19th COVID-19 screening for Medford High School families.

1409
02:08:31,601 --> 02:08:33,841
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Knight.

1410
02:08:34,501 --> 02:08:35,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1411
02:08:37,782 --> 02:08:46,628
[SPEAKER_04]: We've all been around Gail Armstrong, Richie Raymond, Sean Mangan at one point or another being involved in this community.

1412
02:08:47,148 --> 02:08:53,893
[SPEAKER_04]: And the outreach work that Armstrong Ambulance does and the give backs that they give to this community are innumerable.

1413
02:08:55,648 --> 02:09:06,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Just recently, about a month ago, Armstrong Ambulance was tasked with the responsibility of helping do COVID testing for the MHS families up at Medford High School.

1414
02:09:07,114 --> 02:09:10,356
[SPEAKER_04]: And to say that that was a momentous task is an understatement.

1415
02:09:11,336 --> 02:09:15,078
[SPEAKER_04]: But through their efforts and that of our friends in the Board of Health, they were able to pull it off.

1416
02:09:17,218 --> 02:09:30,309
[SPEAKER_04]: When you look at the testing that's been done in our community versus surrounding communities, you'll see that Medford's probably, at the time that this was done, about 1,000 tests ahead of the nearest community.

1417
02:09:30,349 --> 02:09:35,293
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the only community around here was Lynn that had tested more people than the city of Medford.

1418
02:09:36,414 --> 02:09:39,536
[SPEAKER_04]: So it goes to say and it goes to show that

1419
02:09:40,397 --> 02:09:47,262
[SPEAKER_04]: The strength of community partnerships can go a long way in all aspects of public life, but especially public health here.

1420
02:09:47,282 --> 02:09:52,286
[SPEAKER_04]: We've seen the community rise up and come together during this coronavirus situation.

1421
02:09:52,927 --> 02:09:58,992
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that the efforts in the work of Gail, Richie, and Sean shouldn't go unnoticed, Mr. President.

1422
02:10:00,092 --> 02:10:03,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Not only in this endeavor, but in all that they do.

1423
02:10:03,814 --> 02:10:10,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether it comes to the free CPI training that they give to our coaches or the IADs that they've donated to our community.

1424
02:10:10,698 --> 02:10:15,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Armstrong does a lot, and I think it's important that we recognize what they do and the work that they do.

1425
02:10:15,420 --> 02:10:21,003
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that being said, I'm asking my council colleagues to support me in this agenda item this evening.

1426
02:10:21,924 --> 02:10:22,784
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilman Knight.

1427
02:10:23,424 --> 02:10:24,385
[SPEAKER_26]: Vice President Caviello.

1428
02:10:26,048 --> 02:10:26,909
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you for bringing this up.

1429
02:10:28,449 --> 02:10:33,492
[SPEAKER_23]: The Armstrong family, Rich and Sean, they've been great people for our community.

1430
02:10:33,532 --> 02:10:37,495
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, I've had the opportunity to work with them on many projects.

1431
02:10:38,075 --> 02:10:44,799
[SPEAKER_23]: I've been trained by Sean Manion many times to be CPS certified, Red Cross certified.

1432
02:10:45,599 --> 02:10:48,701
[SPEAKER_23]: So again, these are good people.

1433
02:10:48,741 --> 02:10:49,682
[SPEAKER_23]: They're there all the time.

1434
02:10:50,562 --> 02:10:53,784
[SPEAKER_23]: Long before the COVID, this company has been out there.

1435
02:10:55,325 --> 02:10:58,806
[SPEAKER_23]: Anytime the community has needed some assistance with anything, they've been there.

1436
02:10:58,826 --> 02:11:02,107
[SPEAKER_23]: So again, I thank them for the work that they've done in our community.

1437
02:11:02,647 --> 02:11:03,827
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Vice President Caviello.

1438
02:11:03,867 --> 02:11:05,908
[SPEAKER_26]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by- Second.

1458
02:11:49,479 --> 02:11:52,442

1459

[SPEAKER_04]: I bring this paper forward.

[SPEAKER_33]: If my council colleague wouldn't mind adding my paper on to this, paper 20-542, where they are similar in nature.

1462
02:12:13,718 --> 02:12:13,999
[SPEAKER_33]: Sure.

1463
02:12:14,019 --> 02:12:16,199

02:13:29,706 --> 02:13:33,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, thank you very much, and thank you to Councilor Mox for allowing me to proceed first.

1496
02:13:34,871 --> 02:13:41,457
[SPEAKER_04]: I bring this paper forward, Mr. President, in light of a recent string of troubling events that have been brought to my attention.

1497
02:13:41,557 --> 02:13:49,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Home break-ins in the West Medford neighborhood, home invasions in the heights in South Medford, in the West Medford neighborhood.

1498
02:13:51,105 --> 02:13:55,186
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a crime analyst, Mr. President, that we budgeted, and the crime analyst does an excellent job.

1499
02:13:55,786 --> 02:14:05,248
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know that our decision makers in the police department are using that data to make good policy recommendations and good policing recommendations.

1500
02:14:05,868 --> 02:14:19,252
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think it's also important, Mr. President, that we have the opportunity to review this data to see what type of crime is happening in our community, whether it's violent crime, whether it's crime of personal property, whether it's domestic violence, whether it is.

1501
02:14:21,112 --> 02:14:30,742
[SPEAKER_04]: any number of identifiable trends or patents that will allow us to be dynamic and flexible in our response to it, Mr. President.

1502
02:14:31,423 --> 02:14:35,047
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm more than happy to sit down and discuss supplemental funding.

1503
02:14:35,087 --> 02:14:37,990
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm more than happy to sit down and discuss providing.

1504
02:14:39,588 --> 02:14:42,331
[SPEAKER_04]: any department in this community with the tools that they need to succeed.

1505
02:14:42,871 --> 02:14:52,500
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's very important for us to have a good understanding as to what the trends are and what the patents are in this community, so that we can get ahead of it and invest money in certain areas that we need to invest money in.

1506
02:14:53,121 --> 02:14:56,384
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, we have Harold McGilvery, he's our dog officer.

1507
02:14:56,604 --> 02:14:58,266
[SPEAKER_04]: He's an awesome dog officer, he does a great job.

1508
02:15:00,375 --> 02:15:03,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe based upon the crime statistic and crime trends, we need two dog officers.

1509
02:15:04,778 --> 02:15:05,758
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a traffic division.

1510
02:15:05,859 --> 02:15:08,360
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a traffic division comprised of so many officers.

1511
02:15:09,321 --> 02:15:17,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe based upon the crime statistics and the accident statistics, it shows that we should be having more officers in the traffic division and less officers in another division.

1512
02:15:18,367 --> 02:15:23,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Operational questions, Mr. President, certainly stuff that comes under the purview and scope of the Chief of Police.

1513
02:15:23,750 --> 02:15:26,871
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's something that's contingent and reliant upon funding.

1514
02:15:27,351 --> 02:15:33,052
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we're going to be spending the money, I want to make sure we're spending it in the right place to make the most impact and the most bang for our buck.

1515
02:15:33,612 --> 02:15:37,612
[SPEAKER_04]: And with the uptick in violent crime in this community, I think this is something that we really need to look at.

1516
02:15:38,172 --> 02:15:41,033
[SPEAKER_04]: And I shouldn't even say it's an uptick, because I don't know, because I haven't seen the stats.

1517
02:15:41,593 --> 02:15:49,234
[SPEAKER_04]: I should say with the public reporting of violent crime of recent in the community, I'm wondering if this is something that we need to be worried about.

1518
02:15:49,254 --> 02:15:53,055
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that being said, I'm going to defer to Councilor Mox, Mr. President, but thank you very much for indulging me.

1519
02:15:53,356 --> 02:15:54,778
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilor Knight, Councilor Marks.

1520
02:15:55,819 --> 02:15:56,680
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1521
02:15:56,700 --> 02:16:01,546
[SPEAKER_33]: I want to thank my council colleague, Councilor Knight, for putting this on the agenda as well.

1522
02:16:02,927 --> 02:16:08,253
[SPEAKER_33]: For the past several years, Mr. President, I've called for a public safety summit within this community.

1523
02:16:08,974 --> 02:16:13,379
[SPEAKER_33]: And to date, I'm not proud to say that we have yet to have a public safety summit.

1524
02:16:14,060 --> 02:16:18,984
[SPEAKER_33]: with all the parties to be within this community to discuss these very issues.

1525
02:16:19,705 --> 02:16:23,629
[SPEAKER_33]: And Councilor Knight may not say it, but I am going to say it, Mr. President.

1526
02:16:24,649 --> 02:16:27,212
[SPEAKER_33]: Violent crime is on the uptick in this community.

1527
02:16:27,812 --> 02:16:32,496
[SPEAKER_33]: And you only have to read the paper, watch the local news, and talk to your neighbors.

1528
02:16:33,077 --> 02:16:35,559
[SPEAKER_33]: And you'll hear what's happening in this community, Mr. President.

1529
02:16:35,879 --> 02:16:39,302
[SPEAKER_33]: From home invasions, to car break-ins, to home break-ins.

1530
02:16:40,243 --> 02:16:44,667
[SPEAKER_33]: It's happening all over the community, and I think it's very important.

1531
02:16:45,028 --> 02:16:50,473
[SPEAKER_33]: I realize we do have a crime analyst in the community that's gathering crime data.

1532
02:16:51,053 --> 02:16:56,398
[SPEAKER_33]: But the data is only as good, Mr. President, when it's being used for.

1533
02:16:57,119 --> 02:17:05,864
[SPEAKER_33]: So if it's not being used to update and provide the latest and greatest for our police department, then it's not good data.

1534
02:17:06,424 --> 02:17:11,147
[SPEAKER_33]: If it's not used, Mr. President, to get the word out to the community, and that is key.

1535
02:17:11,947 --> 02:17:13,228
[SPEAKER_33]: That is key in this community.

1536
02:17:13,548 --> 02:17:19,271
[SPEAKER_33]: I've talked to a lot of seniors in this community that are unaware, Mr. President, on what's happening.

1537
02:17:19,791 --> 02:17:25,995
[SPEAKER_33]: And I tell people constantly that may leave their front door open or their car unlocked to say, you know what?

1538
02:17:26,535 --> 02:17:28,016
[SPEAKER_33]: Those days are behind us.

1539
02:17:28,137 --> 02:17:29,738
[SPEAKER_33]: I hate to say it, they're behind us now.

1540
02:17:30,158 --> 02:17:32,541
[SPEAKER_33]: And you should always proceed with caution.

1541
02:17:33,141 --> 02:17:37,425
[SPEAKER_33]: And I believe you should be locking your front door, even during the day, Mr. President.

1542
02:17:37,745 --> 02:17:39,387
[SPEAKER_33]: I believe you should be locking your car.

1543
02:17:39,647 --> 02:17:41,288
[SPEAKER_33]: You should be watching out for your neighbors.

1544
02:17:41,549 --> 02:17:42,690
[SPEAKER_33]: You should leave a light on.

1545
02:17:43,290 --> 02:17:47,755
[SPEAKER_33]: that may deter someone from robbing a house or a car or so forth.

1546
02:17:48,235 --> 02:17:52,380
[SPEAKER_33]: But I think the announce of prevention goes a long way, the old saying.

1547
02:17:52,960 --> 02:17:59,127
[SPEAKER_33]: And we have to get word out to the community, not to alarm people, but to let them know what's happening.

1548
02:17:59,587 --> 02:18:03,150
[SPEAKER_33]: To let them know that they should take extra precaution, Mr. President.

1549
02:18:03,811 --> 02:18:08,635
[SPEAKER_33]: And I ask that our police department step up patrol around the community.

1550
02:18:09,055 --> 02:18:14,740
[SPEAKER_33]: I ask that we do have this public safety summit to discuss some of the concerns we have.

1551
02:18:15,500 --> 02:18:25,504
[SPEAKER_33]: Just recently, Mr. President, and I won't get into the details, we had a home invasion that involved a 92-year-old woman that luckily, Mr. President, was able to escape.

1552
02:18:25,804 --> 02:18:30,626
[SPEAKER_33]: because God knows what would have resulted if she was not able to escape, Mr. President.

1553
02:18:31,346 --> 02:18:36,148
[SPEAKER_33]: And there's been some scuttlebutt around the community that this person may have been part of.

1554
02:18:36,628 --> 02:18:42,431
[SPEAKER_33]: a halfway house in the community, and living in our neighborhood, and living amongst us, Mr. President.

1555
02:18:43,572 --> 02:18:48,735
[SPEAKER_33]: And that raises some concern for residents, and rightfully so, Mr. President.

1556
02:18:48,755 --> 02:18:59,080
[SPEAKER_33]: So I think as a community, we have to take a step back and look at what's happening in our community, ways we can address issues, ways we can make our residents safer, Mr. President.

1557
02:18:59,381 --> 02:19:04,924
[SPEAKER_33]: We have a large percentage of seniors, and seniors are very vulnerable, Mr. President.

1558
02:19:05,564 --> 02:19:06,885
[SPEAKER_33]: So that's my concern.

1559
02:19:06,905 --> 02:19:11,208
[SPEAKER_33]: I would ask once again that we create a public safety summit.

1560
02:19:11,828 --> 02:19:16,831
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm not sure why it's impossible to get a public safety summit together.

1561
02:19:17,191 --> 02:19:19,633
[SPEAKER_33]: I think I must have offered it three or four times.

1562
02:19:20,713 --> 02:19:32,421
[SPEAKER_33]: And I've yet to get any buy-in from the former chief or this chief or anyone else, Mr. President, administration or anyone else to sit down and discuss these issues.

1563
02:19:33,081 --> 02:19:34,502
[SPEAKER_33]: Because this is hitting home now.

1564
02:19:34,983 --> 02:19:37,845
[SPEAKER_33]: It's not somewhere you're saying, well, this happens here or there.

1565
02:19:38,185 --> 02:19:39,867
[SPEAKER_33]: It's happening in our neighborhoods.

1566
02:19:40,227 --> 02:19:41,488
[SPEAKER_33]: It's happening to our neighbors.

1567
02:19:42,049 --> 02:19:43,610
[SPEAKER_33]: And it's concerning, Mr. President.

1568
02:19:43,670 --> 02:19:53,038
[SPEAKER_33]: So I just want to put that out there, that once again I ask for a public safety summit where we can sit down around the table and discuss some of the concerns we have.

1569
02:19:53,438 --> 02:19:55,820
[SPEAKER_33]: If it's funding, then as Councilor Knight mentioned,

1570
02:19:56,100 --> 02:19:57,622
[SPEAKER_33]: then the council should be aware of that.

1571
02:19:57,922 --> 02:20:02,988
[SPEAKER_33]: If it's additional manpower, if it's additional tools that the police department needs to get the job done.

1572
02:20:03,369 --> 02:20:10,377
[SPEAKER_33]: If it's additional outreach, community outreach, then so be it to make sure that residents are aware of what's happening.

1573
02:20:10,757 --> 02:20:12,760
[SPEAKER_33]: I've asked in the past to use the reverse 911.

1574
02:20:14,101 --> 02:20:21,129
[SPEAKER_33]: You know, it's great to get when there's a road race in the city and you get a reverse 9-1-1, but 9-1-1 is for emergency.

1575
02:20:21,610 --> 02:20:28,098
[SPEAKER_33]: What better emergency than if there are home invasions and people being attacked in our community, Mr. President?

1576
02:20:29,079 --> 02:20:31,141
[SPEAKER_33]: You know, and how blatant

1577
02:20:31,842 --> 02:20:39,548
[SPEAKER_33]: when someone's sitting there and someone jumps through a picture window, a glass picture window, with the person sitting right there.

1578
02:20:40,228 --> 02:20:42,930
[SPEAKER_33]: They weren't trying to avoid detection.

1579
02:20:43,250 --> 02:20:45,032
[SPEAKER_33]: They weren't trying to avoid the person.

1580
02:20:46,743 --> 02:20:52,044
[SPEAKER_33]: These are very serious incidences, Mr. President, and they need to be discussed and addressed.

1581
02:20:52,524 --> 02:20:58,966
[SPEAKER_33]: And I realize the police are probably working on their own, and things that they can't relay to the public, and I realize that.

1582
02:20:59,466 --> 02:21:07,928
[SPEAKER_33]: But I also believe the public should be well aware of what's going on, and we should be open and notorious when it comes to alerting residents of this community.

1583
02:21:08,308 --> 02:21:10,069
[SPEAKER_33]: And I want to thank my colleague for putting this on.

1584
02:21:10,309 --> 02:21:11,189
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilor Mox.

1585
02:21:11,209 --> 02:21:11,909
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Behrs.

1586
02:21:13,107 --> 02:21:13,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1587
02:21:14,408 --> 02:21:15,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, colleagues, for putting it on.

1588
02:21:15,850 --> 02:21:21,976
[SPEAKER_05]: I completely agree that we need to look at trends and patterns and really be able to analyze and make the best decisions possible.

1589
02:21:22,716 --> 02:21:30,104
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'd just, you know, I'd like to amend the paper for getting reports and data back to the year 2000, if possible.

1590
02:21:30,184 --> 02:21:36,390
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand that might take more time, so I'm not going to put a time limit on it, but I would love to be able to see the long-term trends.

1591
02:21:36,730 --> 02:21:37,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1592
02:21:37,896 --> 02:21:38,896
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Counselor Pierce.

1593
02:21:38,996 --> 02:21:39,977
[SPEAKER_26]: Point of information, Mr. President.

1594
02:21:40,057 --> 02:21:41,277
[SPEAKER_26]: Point of information, Counselor Knight.

1595
02:21:42,238 --> 02:21:46,880
[SPEAKER_04]: I do not believe we had a crime analyst going back that far.

1596
02:21:47,600 --> 02:21:49,141
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a crime analyst was something that

1597
02:21:52,401 --> 02:21:56,903
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe in your first term, Councilor Scott-Pelly's first term was something that we had put into the budget.

1598
02:21:57,863 --> 02:22:09,207
[SPEAKER_04]: So while I think that the data exists in terms of paper records and paper files, there wasn't someone there that was actually working as a crime analyst compiling that stuff and looking at trends and patterns and the such.

1599
02:22:10,107 --> 02:22:14,309
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd ask that it be offered in the B papers to not hold up the underlying paper that's been offered on top of it.

1600
02:22:16,020 --> 02:22:18,801
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fine with me.

1601
02:22:18,941 --> 02:22:21,501
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm putting a timeline on it.

1602
02:22:21,541 --> 02:22:23,302
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems like there's data going back a few years.

1603
02:22:23,342 --> 02:22:26,322
[SPEAKER_05]: That could be really helpful, and maybe longer if it's there.

1604
02:22:27,382 --> 02:22:28,563
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilor Behrs.

1605
02:22:28,663 --> 02:22:30,463
[SPEAKER_26]: Clerk Hutterby, do you have the language on the B paper?

1606
02:22:33,964 --> 02:22:34,684
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, Mr. President.

1607
02:22:35,224 --> 02:22:37,884
[SPEAKER_22]: I have a question after that.

1608
02:22:37,944 --> 02:22:45,326
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Behrs originally offered an amendment, which is now a B paper, requesting reports and data back to the year 2000 on crime statistics.

1609
02:22:46,653 --> 02:22:47,294
[SPEAKER_05]: if possible.

1610
02:22:48,375 --> 02:22:48,675
[SPEAKER_22]: OK.

1611
02:22:49,196 --> 02:22:52,238
[SPEAKER_22]: And then I have another question, if I may.

1612
02:22:52,499 --> 02:22:56,022
[SPEAKER_22]: Yep.

1613
02:22:57,663 --> 02:23:00,806
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Marks, you asked for a minute to the papers.

1614
02:23:00,826 --> 02:23:04,770
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm sorry, I didn't hear that.

1615
02:23:04,790 --> 02:23:05,511
[SPEAKER_26]: I didn't hear that.

1616
02:23:05,651 --> 02:23:06,492
[SPEAKER_26]: Did you say it was an amendment?

1617
02:23:06,552 --> 02:23:07,713
[SPEAKER_26]: Were you asking if it's an amendment?

1618
02:23:08,386 --> 02:23:12,849
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm asking if Councilor Marks' request to create a public safety summit is an amendment to the papers.

1619
02:23:20,155 --> 02:23:21,015
[SPEAKER_22]: I didn't hear the answer.

1620
02:23:21,496 --> 02:23:21,956
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes.

1621
02:23:22,837 --> 02:23:23,297
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1622
02:23:25,779 --> 02:23:27,740
Excuse me.

1623
02:23:28,221 --> 02:23:29,301
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, so let's see.

1624
02:23:29,321 --> 02:23:32,284
[SPEAKER_26]: So we get a B paper from Councilor Behrs.

1625
02:23:32,604 --> 02:23:33,945
[SPEAKER_26]: Is that B paper seconded?

1626
02:23:34,825 --> 02:23:35,586
[SPEAKER_23]: Seconded.

1627
02:23:35,626 --> 02:23:36,827
[SPEAKER_26]: Seconded by Councilor Morrell.

1628
02:23:44,569 --> 02:23:48,011
[SPEAKER_26]: We have Councilor Marks, did you wanna speak?

1629
02:23:48,111 --> 02:23:48,652
[SPEAKER_26]: Nope, okay.

1630
02:23:50,273 --> 02:23:50,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

1631
02:23:51,754 --> 02:23:52,714
[SPEAKER_04]: That's on from the beginning.

1632
02:23:52,994 --> 02:23:54,455
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, I'm gonna shut it off.

1633
02:23:57,117 --> 02:23:57,617
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, let's see.

1634
02:23:58,658 --> 02:24:00,979
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, do we have any questions or comments from the public?

1635
02:24:07,803 --> 02:24:09,164
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, seeing and hearing none.

1636
02:24:09,645 --> 02:24:12,867
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, on the B paper, offered by Councilor Behrs, seconded by Councilor Morrell.

1637
02:24:13,810 --> 02:24:14,850
[SPEAKER_26]: Court of Appeals, please call the roll.

1638
02:24:17,111 --> 02:24:17,732

02:24:18,252 --> 02:24:18,512
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

Yes.

1642
02:24:22,734 --> 02:24:23,334
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Knight?

1643
02:24:23,594 --> 02:24:23,754
Yes.

1644
02:24:27,235 --> 02:24:28,716
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm sorry, I didn't hear Councilor Knight.

1645
02:24:29,156 --> 02:24:29,396
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1646
02:24:30,097 --> 02:24:30,477

1649
02:24:33,698 --> 02:24:34,098
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1650
02:24:34,658 --> 02:24:35,299

1653
02:24:38,093 --> 02:24:38,393
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1654
02:24:39,133 --> 02:24:39,914
[SPEAKER_22]: President Franco?

1655
02:24:40,134 --> 02:24:40,434
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

1656
02:24:40,714 --> 02:24:42,135
[SPEAKER_26]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1657
02:24:42,155 --> 02:24:43,056
[SPEAKER_26]: The motion passes.

1658
02:24:43,496 --> 02:24:47,379
[SPEAKER_26]: On the main paper offered by Councilor Knight and Councilor Marks.

1659
02:24:48,480 --> 02:24:50,901
[SPEAKER_26]: Seconded by Vice President Carviello.

[SPEAKER_22]: Vice President Carviello?

1664
02:24:58,386 --> 02:24:58,586
Yes.

1665
02:25:00,287 --> 02:25:00,828
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Knight?

1666
02:25:00,968 --> 02:25:01,268
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1667
02:25:02,269 --> 02:25:02,909
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Marks?

1668
02:25:02,969 --> 02:25:03,269
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1669
02:25:04,530 --> 02:25:05,171
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Morrell?

1670
02:25:05,431 --> 02:25:05,651
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1671
02:25:06,623 --> 02:25:07,424
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1672
02:25:07,584 --> 02:25:07,885
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1673
02:25:08,766 --> 02:25:09,506
[SPEAKER_22]: President Franco?

1674
02:25:09,587 --> 02:25:09,827
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

1675
02:25:09,867 --> 02:25:12,110
[SPEAKER_26]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

1676
02:25:12,130 --> 02:25:15,574
[SPEAKER_26]: 20-530 offered by Councilor Morrell.

1677
02:25:16,114 --> 02:25:25,385
[SPEAKER_26]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council demand that the MBTA reinstate bus routes 325 and 326 as they are an essential link to residents of Medford.

1678
02:25:25,966 --> 02:25:26,467
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Morrell.

1679
02:25:26,987 --> 02:25:27,928
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1680
02:25:27,968 --> 02:25:39,437
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I know this is something that has been raised by Councilor Marks a few months back when these two lines, which are the express lines from Medford, were suspended, as we were told, temporarily in the earlier days of the pandemic.

1681
02:25:40,177 --> 02:25:53,448
[SPEAKER_07]: We do have in our packet this week some back and forth from the mayor and Todd Blake with the MBTA, and the way the MBTA inevitably thanked the mayor for advocacy is suspending these routes indefinitely in mid-August.

1682
02:25:54,088 --> 02:26:03,813
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is especially concerning to me because frontline workers, which are going into work every day, are people who are more likely to need public transportation.

1683
02:26:04,473 --> 02:26:08,495
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have essentially cut them off from these express routes, not we, the MBTA.

1684
02:26:09,556 --> 02:26:12,977
[SPEAKER_07]: And I did speak with our state delegation about this, and they are working on it.

1685
02:26:14,558 --> 02:26:30,554
[SPEAKER_07]: What they told me that we can do is really show a unified front on this, so I'm just asking moving approval on this paper to really demand that the MBTA reinstate these essential links and help people from Medford get on those express routes into Boston where they need to go get to work.

1686
02:26:31,114 --> 02:26:31,495
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1687
02:26:31,635 --> 02:26:32,476
[SPEAKER_05]: Second, Mr. President.

1688
02:26:32,935 --> 02:26:33,956
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

1689
02:26:34,376 --> 02:26:37,278
[SPEAKER_26]: On the motion of Councilor Morrell, seconded by Councilor Pierce.

1690
02:26:37,298 --> 02:26:39,800
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Scarpelli, you didn't want to- Thank you, Mr. President.

1691
02:26:40,161 --> 02:26:41,021
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1692
02:26:41,401 --> 02:26:49,528
[SPEAKER_29]: So I spoke with our state delegates with Councilor, Representative Donato and Representative Garbale.

1693
02:26:49,968 --> 02:26:54,512
[SPEAKER_29]: I think that I asked them for permission to hold a committee.

1694
02:26:55,993 --> 02:27:10,825
[SPEAKER_29]: a subcommittee meeting on transportation to bring them back because the exact words they used, that they were lied to by the administration of the T. So that's bothersome considering those gentlemen and

1695
02:27:11,986 --> 02:27:20,848
[SPEAKER_29]: And their partner in crime and Christine Barber have other people that make sure they get their funding needed to make sure their business runs.

1696
02:27:20,928 --> 02:27:33,210
[SPEAKER_29]: So these are the MO, this is the MO for the T that they promise and don't fulfill what they've asked, what they say when they come in.

1697
02:27:33,250 --> 02:27:39,772
[SPEAKER_29]: I know that we have many resolutions that can show that, so I did talk to our

1698
02:27:40,825 --> 02:27:45,888
[SPEAKER_29]: representatives and did talk to a few people that traversed that route.

1699
02:27:46,128 --> 02:27:56,035
[SPEAKER_29]: And if we can, I know that we're very fortunate we have our city clerk that knows all the ins and outs and the people that need to be called.

1700
02:27:56,155 --> 02:28:00,478
[SPEAKER_29]: So I'm going to call on Adam Herterbees, if he can, to help us again.

1701
02:28:01,218 --> 02:28:09,682
[SPEAKER_29]: To get those people that we need at a table, I think that before we do that, I think we need to do a ridership study that shows the numbers.

1702
02:28:09,823 --> 02:28:20,208
[SPEAKER_29]: I know the numbers are down right now, but that doesn't mean, that really doesn't mean anything because like we're saying, it's quality instead of quantity now.

1703
02:28:20,308 --> 02:28:21,789
[SPEAKER_29]: So we need those buses and

1704
02:28:24,710 --> 02:28:26,311
[SPEAKER_29]: We'll be calling for a subcommittee meeting.

1705
02:28:26,811 --> 02:28:36,273
[SPEAKER_29]: They're ready to go whenever you are, Council President, where we can find a date that's open and get those representatives at a table to answer a lot of questions.

1706
02:28:36,433 --> 02:28:43,134
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, we're also waiting for the Department of Transportation to still give us an answer on, ready, south of Maine.

1707
02:28:43,395 --> 02:28:53,437
[SPEAKER_29]: So as we're seeing traffic pick up now, there was a lull, so there wasn't a outcry, but as you're seeing the traffic

1708
02:28:54,478 --> 02:28:57,301
[SPEAKER_29]: uptick that we're going to start seeing some issues again.

1709
02:28:57,321 --> 02:29:00,104
[SPEAKER_29]: It's something we need to do.

1710
02:29:00,164 --> 02:29:01,225
[SPEAKER_29]: So thank you, Mr. President.

1711
02:29:01,345 --> 02:29:02,546
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1712
02:29:02,566 --> 02:29:03,307
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Behrs?

1713
02:29:04,469 --> 02:29:05,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1714
02:29:05,249 --> 02:29:09,574
[SPEAKER_05]: I think actually Councilor Scarpelli made most of the points.

1715
02:29:09,814 --> 02:29:11,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, it's just an example of

1716
02:29:12,880 --> 02:29:20,306
[SPEAKER_05]: poor communication or directly false communication made to people in the city around this issue.

1717
02:29:20,906 --> 02:29:22,388
[SPEAKER_05]: So I completely agree.

1718
02:29:22,748 --> 02:29:27,852
[SPEAKER_05]: And I did not know that they were also sending their communications to our state delegation as well.

1719
02:29:27,932 --> 02:29:30,254
[SPEAKER_05]: So it sounds like we have some issues to address here.

1720
02:29:31,355 --> 02:29:32,376
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilor Behrs.

1721
02:29:32,476 --> 02:29:33,717
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Knight.

1722
02:29:34,698 --> 02:29:36,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, I find this ironic.

1723
02:29:37,600 --> 02:29:41,903
[SPEAKER_04]: I find it ironic that the MBTA cuts the express bus service that people take.

1724
02:29:42,785 --> 02:29:43,211
[SPEAKER_04]: because

1725
02:29:44,439 --> 02:29:48,322
[SPEAKER_04]: The other modes of transit that the t office is so inefficient and unreliable.

1726
02:29:49,182 --> 02:29:50,864
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, ultimately, you take the bus, you take the 325.

1727
02:29:51,084 --> 02:29:53,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Counselor Mox takes the 325.

1728
02:29:53,546 --> 02:30:04,573
[SPEAKER_04]: You take the 325 because you don't want to take a bus to a train station and miss the bus or wait for a bus that's late to get to the train station to be packed in like a sardine or miss the first two trains when you get there because there's no room for you to get on the train.

1729
02:30:05,614 --> 02:30:09,257
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's nonsensical to me in a way, Mr. President.

1730
02:30:09,277 --> 02:30:13,100
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like they created these express lanes because people,

1731
02:30:13,800 --> 02:30:19,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Needed to get to work and couldn't rely on the existing modalities that the MBTA was offering, right?

1732
02:30:19,642 --> 02:30:23,423
[SPEAKER_04]: So here we are now, going back, and they're going to cut these from our community, which is fine.

1733
02:30:23,683 --> 02:30:25,443
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to cut them, okay, that's what you want to do.

1734
02:30:26,163 --> 02:30:31,905
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm assuming that there's going to be a corresponding cut in our assessment, because our assessment's based on the level of service that we receive.

1735
02:30:32,405 --> 02:30:35,246
[SPEAKER_04]: And if they're cutting our services, then they should also be cutting our assessments.

1736
02:30:35,646 --> 02:30:42,608
[SPEAKER_04]: So my question would be also, what impact does this have on the MBTA's assessment to the community of Medford, where they're cutting service for the bus line.

1737
02:30:43,268 --> 02:30:45,090
[SPEAKER_04]: The assessments for our bus service should be cut as well.

1738
02:30:45,710 --> 02:30:52,496
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd ask that question as to what the correlating assessment reduction with the reduction in these bus lines.

1739
02:30:53,056 --> 02:30:54,817
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd offer that in the form of an amendment.

1740
02:30:55,938 --> 02:30:56,999
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1741
02:30:57,460 --> 02:30:58,921
[SPEAKER_26]: So that is an amendment to the paper.

1742
02:31:00,942 --> 02:31:01,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Second the amendment.

1743
02:31:04,585 --> 02:31:05,806
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm still copying the amendment down.

1744
02:31:18,255 --> 02:31:47,109
[SPEAKER_29]: Mr. President, I also neglected to- I also neglected to offer that as amendment too, that our clerk reach out to the state delegates who already know and the representatives from the T to one, begin by putting a study, a ridership study together and be prepared to hold a subcommittee on transportation as soon as possible.

1745
02:31:48,045 --> 02:31:48,345
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

1746
02:31:49,626 --> 02:31:50,007
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1747
02:31:50,027 --> 02:31:52,429
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1748
02:31:52,449 --> 02:31:52,789
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1749
02:31:52,809 --> 02:31:53,210
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1750
02:31:53,230 --> 02:31:53,970
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1751
02:31:54,251 --> 02:31:54,591
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1752
02:31:54,611 --> 02:31:55,051
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1753
02:31:55,091 --> 02:31:56,312
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1754
02:31:56,332 --> 02:31:57,093
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1755
02:31:57,113 --> 02:31:58,594
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1756
02:32:15,777 --> 02:32:25,099
[SPEAKER_22]: is to have the former MBTA Chief of Staff reach out to the State Delegation and the MBTA.

1757
02:32:26,099 --> 02:32:27,859
[SPEAKER_22]: And also to commission a ridership study.

1758
02:32:29,780 --> 02:32:33,260
[SPEAKER_22]: And then meet in the Subcommittee on Transportation.

1759
02:32:33,740 --> 02:32:34,941
[SPEAKER_22]: The State Delegates, correct.

1760
02:32:36,901 --> 02:32:38,121
[SPEAKER_22]: And the State Delegation, yes.

1761
02:32:38,141 --> 02:32:38,581
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1762
02:32:41,022 --> 02:32:42,522
[SPEAKER_29]: I'll take that former Chief of Staff too.

1763
02:32:44,323 --> 02:32:45,465
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1764
02:32:45,485 --> 02:32:46,366
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1765
02:32:46,686 --> 02:32:47,407
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Marks.

1766
02:32:48,489 --> 02:32:49,350
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1767
02:32:49,370 --> 02:32:53,114
[SPEAKER_33]: I want to thank Councilor Morrell for bringing this up.

1768
02:32:53,134 --> 02:32:54,376
[SPEAKER_33]: There's a pattern here.

1769
02:32:55,517 --> 02:33:02,706
[SPEAKER_33]: Over the last two years, mostly two years, the MBTA has tried to cut a number of bus routes.

1770
02:33:03,687 --> 02:33:12,289
[SPEAKER_33]: over and over again, Mr. President, and residents have to stand up and fight and contact the T and contact the state delegation and the mayor and the city council.

1771
02:33:12,809 --> 02:33:26,253
[SPEAKER_33]: And it's pretty disturbing that an MBTA, that their chief mission is to provide access of transportation, and they're constantly looking to cut back.

1772
02:33:26,613 --> 02:33:29,454
[SPEAKER_33]: transportation in surrounding communities.

1773
02:33:29,955 --> 02:33:31,896
[SPEAKER_33]: So that's number one, Mr. President.

1774
02:33:32,716 --> 02:33:38,239
[SPEAKER_33]: For full disclosure, I do, for the past four years, I've taken both the 325 and the 326.

1775
02:33:38,619 --> 02:33:46,643
[SPEAKER_33]: So some of this is from my own selfish standpoint, someone that takes that bus and has been on the bus with

1776
02:33:47,403 --> 02:33:52,747
[SPEAKER_33]: many, many other people that rely on that bus for transportation to and from work, Mr. President.

1777
02:33:53,988 --> 02:33:55,469
[SPEAKER_33]: Counselor Knight hit the nail on the head.

1778
02:33:55,910 --> 02:34:01,734
[SPEAKER_33]: And I've been talking about this literally for, I hate to say it, probably close to 20 years.

1779
02:34:04,217 --> 02:34:04,977
[SPEAKER_33]: Let me tell you.

1780
02:34:05,557 --> 02:34:12,662
[SPEAKER_33]: The MBTA has over $66 million in tax-exempt property in this community.

1781
02:34:13,542 --> 02:34:15,603
[SPEAKER_33]: Tax-exempt, Mr. President.

1782
02:34:15,904 --> 02:34:19,566
[SPEAKER_33]: $66 million that they don't pay the city of Method one nickel for.

1783
02:34:20,686 --> 02:34:25,269
[SPEAKER_33]: Their assessment to us for providing T services as of 2017 was about $3.7 million.

1784
02:34:31,075 --> 02:34:40,364
[SPEAKER_33]: So that's what they charge us over and above when you pay a fare, when you get your T-card, when you pay 20% of the 5% sales tax.

1785
02:34:40,764 --> 02:34:46,349
[SPEAKER_33]: That's over and above we pay as a community, as Councilor Knight mentioned, for this particular service.

1786
02:34:46,850 --> 02:34:52,094
[SPEAKER_33]: So when we have an express bus, we have additional routes, people say, wow, Method has great access.

1787
02:34:52,695 --> 02:34:56,318
[SPEAKER_33]: We pay for it, Mr. President, in many surrounding communities.

1788
02:34:57,342 --> 02:34:59,923
[SPEAKER_33]: Winchester, Arlington, you name it.

1789
02:35:00,723 --> 02:35:08,326
[SPEAKER_33]: They come to Method to jump on the express bus, or to get on the train in West Method, or to go to Wellington.

1790
02:35:08,607 --> 02:35:09,967
[SPEAKER_33]: They come into our community.

1791
02:35:10,307 --> 02:35:12,048
[SPEAKER_33]: We're paying a heavy assessment.

1792
02:35:12,428 --> 02:35:13,469
[SPEAKER_33]: And he's absolutely right.

1793
02:35:13,509 --> 02:35:23,553
[SPEAKER_33]: Back some years ago, I offered a motion, which was passed and sent to our state delegation many years ago, that we offset the T assessment.

1794
02:35:24,554 --> 02:35:28,172
[SPEAKER_33]: based on the tax-exempt property they have in our community.

1795
02:35:29,080 --> 02:35:38,584
[SPEAKER_33]: So if it's 3.7 million that they come and take from us to operate services, they owe us 66 million for having tax exempt property in the community.

1796
02:35:39,044 --> 02:35:40,165
[SPEAKER_33]: So that's how we offset it.

1797
02:35:40,765 --> 02:35:43,726
[SPEAKER_33]: Needless to say, it never went anywhere in the state legislature.

1798
02:35:44,006 --> 02:35:46,007
[SPEAKER_33]: But that's a whole other story for another time.

1799
02:35:47,208 --> 02:35:54,211
[SPEAKER_33]: Method has the sixth highest assessment out of the 175 communities that use the local assistance fund.

1800
02:35:55,031 --> 02:35:57,372
[SPEAKER_33]: We have the sixth highest assessment.

1801
02:35:58,673 --> 02:36:05,999
[SPEAKER_33]: So when it's mentioned, like Councilman Wright mentioned that, you know what, if they're going to take service away, why wouldn't you cut the assessment?

1802
02:36:07,981 --> 02:36:09,602
[SPEAKER_33]: Why wouldn't you cut that assessment?

1803
02:36:10,383 --> 02:36:11,243
[SPEAKER_33]: We're paying for it.

1804
02:36:11,944 --> 02:36:13,325
[SPEAKER_33]: It's not something we're getting for free.

1805
02:36:13,505 --> 02:36:16,588
[SPEAKER_33]: We're paying for it through many different streams.

1806
02:36:18,338 --> 02:36:20,039
[SPEAKER_33]: It comes right off our charity sheet.

1807
02:36:20,079 --> 02:36:26,661
[SPEAKER_33]: So whatever local aid we get from the state, they look at it and say, okay, you're going to get 15 million.

1808
02:36:26,901 --> 02:36:29,922
[SPEAKER_33]: We're taking 3.7 million from the T assessment.

1809
02:36:30,962 --> 02:36:32,402
[SPEAKER_33]: So we're paying, Mr. President.

1810
02:36:34,303 --> 02:36:36,464
[SPEAKER_33]: And I think the T should answer to this.

1811
02:36:37,064 --> 02:36:38,024
[SPEAKER_33]: They really need to answer.

1812
02:36:38,064 --> 02:36:40,965
[SPEAKER_33]: So I support what Councilor Knight offered.

1813
02:36:41,265 --> 02:36:43,106
[SPEAKER_33]: I'd also like to know, Mr. President,

1814
02:36:44,553 --> 02:36:52,185
[SPEAKER_33]: How are they going to start to pay us back for the $66 million in tax-exempt property they have in this community?

1815
02:36:53,547 --> 02:36:56,652
[SPEAKER_33]: Between Wellington Station, the car bonds on Salem Street.

1816
02:37:00,627 --> 02:37:06,691
[SPEAKER_33]: So I appreciate my colleague putting this on there, and I'd like to hear back from the MBTA to find out exactly, Mr. President.

1817
02:37:07,712 --> 02:37:12,536
[SPEAKER_33]: If this is a temporary cut or reduction in service, that's one thing.

1818
02:37:12,856 --> 02:37:14,317
[SPEAKER_33]: That's not the impression I'm getting.

1819
02:37:16,959 --> 02:37:19,681
[SPEAKER_33]: Once they make the cut, it's going to be very difficult to get it back.

1820
02:37:21,475 --> 02:37:28,179
[SPEAKER_33]: You remember the days, Mr. President, that we had a fight because there were so many people standing on the 325 and 326.

1821
02:37:28,679 --> 02:37:30,781
[SPEAKER_33]: It became a safety concern.

1822
02:37:30,881 --> 02:37:31,481
[SPEAKER_33]: You are correct.

1823
02:37:31,881 --> 02:37:33,202
[SPEAKER_33]: It was over the capacity.

1824
02:37:35,663 --> 02:37:42,888
[SPEAKER_33]: And we asked them to put on additional buses because the 325 and 326 couldn't accommodate the needs of our community.

1825
02:37:47,044 --> 02:37:48,424
[SPEAKER_33]: And they never did so, Mr. President.

1826
02:37:48,444 --> 02:37:56,127
[SPEAKER_33]: I think they may have put on a route here and there, and then they ended up, yeah, I think they ended up putting one route on, and then they ended up canceling that.

1827
02:37:56,987 --> 02:37:58,968
[SPEAKER_33]: But that shows you the need in the community.

1828
02:37:59,248 --> 02:38:02,629
[SPEAKER_33]: I realize COVID has decreased the need, but it's gonna come back.

1829
02:38:03,249 --> 02:38:05,250
[SPEAKER_33]: Everything's gonna come back, and that's gonna come back.

1830
02:38:05,650 --> 02:38:10,471
[SPEAKER_33]: And I don't wanna be behind the eight ball, Mr. President, when residents are looking for the 325 and 326.

1831
02:38:11,752 --> 02:38:14,993
[SPEAKER_33]: So I would ask that you give us a commitment in the form of a motion, Mr. President.

1832
02:38:16,066 --> 02:38:24,330
[SPEAKER_33]: That this is just a temporary reduction in what their plans are for future service for the express bus.

1833
02:38:26,490 --> 02:38:29,752
[SPEAKER_33]: They want to keep people off the roads, they want to keep cars from going into Boston.

1834
02:38:30,312 --> 02:38:31,853
[SPEAKER_33]: Why would you eliminate express bus?

1835
02:38:33,513 --> 02:38:34,534
[SPEAKER_33]: We have an express lane.

1836
02:38:36,135 --> 02:38:38,255
[SPEAKER_33]: What's that used for if there's no express bus?

1837
02:38:40,196 --> 02:38:40,756
[SPEAKER_26]: You are correct.

1838
02:38:41,477 --> 02:38:42,337
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1839
02:38:42,877 --> 02:38:43,918
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1840
02:38:45,390 --> 02:38:49,032
[SPEAKER_26]: And if I may, I thank Councilor Morrell for bringing this forward.

1841
02:38:49,633 --> 02:38:57,518
[SPEAKER_26]: And I know a number of councilors, Councilor Marks, in particular, and myself, I've brought up numerous resolutions about the 325 and the 326 bus for years.

1842
02:38:57,658 --> 02:39:00,059
[SPEAKER_26]: I've been a passenger on that 325 and the 326 for probably

1843
02:39:05,803 --> 02:39:18,692
[SPEAKER_26]: Probably just about 20 years now, and like Consular Marks mentioned, these bus routes have become more and more popular pre-pandemic than I've ever seen since I've been taking them.

1844
02:39:19,373 --> 02:39:27,179
[SPEAKER_26]: And one of my biggest concerns is when they said they were going to temporarily suspend service, that they would never bring service back.

1845
02:39:29,080 --> 02:39:37,009
[SPEAKER_26]: That seems to come to fruition now, and I did give Representative Donato a call today to talk specifically about this.

1846
02:39:37,569 --> 02:39:45,418
[SPEAKER_26]: And he basically told me the same thing he told Councilor Scarpelli, and that is that the MBTA lied to him and to the whole entire state delegation.

1847
02:39:45,839 --> 02:39:46,800
[SPEAKER_26]: It's very unfortunate.

1848
02:39:47,340 --> 02:39:47,841
[SPEAKER_26]: I know he is.

1849
02:39:49,883 --> 02:39:57,748
[SPEAKER_26]: Representative Donato and the rest of the state delegation is fighting to bring this bus service back, the 325 and 326.

1850
02:39:58,209 --> 02:40:04,373
[SPEAKER_26]: I know they're working hard at it, but it's very unfortunate that the MBTA has done this.

1851
02:40:05,354 --> 02:40:13,259
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think knowing the MBTA, when we try to bring it back, they're not just going to bring it back, they're going to probably want all kinds of proof that ridership is there.

1852
02:40:13,379 --> 02:40:15,981
[SPEAKER_26]: And that's a piece I think that's going to be.

1853
02:40:17,082 --> 02:40:21,323
[SPEAKER_26]: Probably we had to prove because right now ridership is low due to the pandemic.

1854
02:40:22,163 --> 02:40:34,746
[SPEAKER_26]: So Councilor Scarpelli, I like the idea of scheduling a subcommittee to look at this and bring in the state delegation and bring in the MBTA and ask really good solid questions.

1855
02:40:35,166 --> 02:40:44,427
[SPEAKER_26]: And really getting them to commit to a timetable as to when they're going to bring things back or when they're going to reevaluate.

1856
02:40:44,728 --> 02:40:46,748
[SPEAKER_26]: But this needs to be addressed.

1857
02:40:47,188 --> 02:40:49,269
[SPEAKER_26]: And it needs to be addressed sooner than later.

1858
02:40:49,649 --> 02:40:51,871
[SPEAKER_26]: So, Councilor Morrelle, thank you for bringing this forward tonight.

1859
02:40:52,431 --> 02:40:54,792
[SPEAKER_26]: And at this time, I would call upon Councilor Behrs.

1860
02:40:55,292 --> 02:40:56,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1861
02:40:56,413 --> 02:41:03,817
[SPEAKER_05]: You just used the phrase temporarily suspended, and it reminded me, I'm pretty sure the E branch of the Green Line past Heath Street has been temporarily suspended since 1998.

1862
02:41:05,097 --> 02:41:09,480
[SPEAKER_05]: And the clerk could correct me, but the A branch maybe has been temporarily suspended since 1969, so.

1863
02:41:09,580 --> 02:41:10,060
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1864
02:41:10,160 --> 02:41:13,021
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

1865
02:41:13,402 --> 02:41:15,703
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Behrs, 1969 was before I was born.

1866
02:41:15,803 --> 02:41:16,043
[SPEAKER_22]: Sorry.

1867
02:41:17,423 --> 02:41:17,883
[SPEAKER_05]: Me, too.

1868
02:41:18,184 --> 02:41:19,205
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Council of Bears.

1869
02:41:19,665 --> 02:41:29,873
[SPEAKER_26]: So on the motion of Councilor Morrell, seconded by Vice President Caballero, as amended by Councilor Knight, Councilor Scott Pelley, and Councilor Marks.

1870
02:41:31,374 --> 02:41:31,995
[SPEAKER_26]: Clerk Hertoghese.

1871
02:41:32,876 --> 02:41:35,037
[SPEAKER_26]: Actually, are there any questions on this before we call the roll?

1872
02:41:35,658 --> 02:41:36,579
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't see any hands raised.

1873
02:41:37,039 --> 02:41:38,120
[SPEAKER_26]: Clerk Hertoghese, please call the roll.

1874
02:41:41,743 --> 02:41:43,284
[SPEAKER_22]: Council of Bears.

1875
02:41:43,905 --> 02:41:44,125
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1876
02:41:45,896 --> 02:41:46,776
[SPEAKER_22]: have a motion for approval.

1877
02:42:02,079 --> 02:42:02,860
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1878
02:42:02,940 --> 02:42:03,280
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1879
02:42:03,300 --> 02:42:04,821
[SPEAKER_22]: President Falco?

1880
02:42:05,042 --> 02:42:05,322
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

1881
02:42:05,682 --> 02:42:07,404
[SPEAKER_26]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1882
02:42:07,464 --> 02:42:08,325
[SPEAKER_26]: The motion passes.

1883
02:42:08,345 --> 02:42:23,038
[SPEAKER_26]: 2-0-531 offered by Vice President Caviello will be a result of the Memphis City Council request that the administration immediately provide funding to the clerk's office to hire additional personnel both permanent and temporary for the upcoming November and future elections.

1884
02:42:24,047 --> 02:42:24,868
[SPEAKER_26]: Vice President Caviello.

1885
02:42:25,048 --> 02:42:31,252
[SPEAKER_23]: Mr. President, I think Councilor Beas has a similar resolution, 20536, if you'd like to read that also.

1886
02:42:31,532 --> 02:42:32,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, move to join.

1887
02:42:32,453 --> 02:42:33,873
[SPEAKER_26]: Was that 20560?

1888
02:42:33,994 --> 02:42:33,873
536.

1889
02:42:34,074 --> 02:42:37,576
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm sorry, 536, okay.

1890
02:42:38,477 --> 02:42:46,082
[SPEAKER_26]: So 20536 offered by Councilor Beas, whereas Medford residents had serious concerns about voting during the September 1st.

1891
02:42:48,499 --> 02:42:58,803
[SPEAKER_26]: State primary election, including missing materials, incorrect information, limited public statements, enforcing of some voters to vote in person without an effective mail option.

1892
02:42:59,323 --> 02:43:05,045
[SPEAKER_26]: Now therefore, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council urges the city administration to ensure that the registrars

1893
02:43:05,525 --> 02:43:15,508
[SPEAKER_26]: Our voters and city clerk have all resources and staff necessary to conduct the November 3rd general election given the significant increase in demand for mail ballots.

1894
02:43:16,008 --> 02:43:20,890
[SPEAKER_26]: Be it further resolved that the city administration provide ballot drop boxes at locations other than Memphis City Hall.

1895
02:43:21,370 --> 02:43:30,913
[SPEAKER_26]: Be it further resolved that all elections communications be translated into languages other than English in a prompt manner for public consumption.

1896
02:43:31,928 --> 02:43:37,450
[SPEAKER_26]: So the motion is by Councilor Caviello, seconded by Councilor Behrs to join these resolutions.

1897
02:43:37,571 --> 02:43:38,811
[SPEAKER_26]: Clerk Carter, please call the roll.

1898
02:43:41,352 --> 02:43:42,153
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Behrs?

1899
02:43:42,353 --> 02:43:42,613
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1900
02:43:43,613 --> 02:43:44,554
[SPEAKER_22]: Vice President Caviello?

1901
02:43:44,654 --> 02:43:44,954
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1902
02:43:45,534 --> 02:43:46,134
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Night?

1903
02:43:46,975 --> 02:43:47,275
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1904
02:43:48,695 --> 02:43:49,356
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Marks?

1905
02:43:49,756 --> 02:43:50,016
Yes.

1906
02:43:50,896 --> 02:43:51,537
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Morrell?

1907
02:43:51,877 --> 02:43:52,097
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

1908
02:43:52,745 --> 02:43:53,485
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Starkelli?

1909
02:43:53,785 --> 02:43:54,145
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1910
02:43:54,706 --> 02:43:55,426
[SPEAKER_22]: President Falco?

1911
02:43:55,726 --> 02:43:58,146
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1912
02:43:58,827 --> 02:44:00,447
[SPEAKER_26]: The motions are joined.

1913
02:44:00,767 --> 02:44:03,368
[SPEAKER_26]: At this point, I call on Vice President Carviello.

1914
02:44:03,568 --> 02:44:04,348
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1915
02:44:04,368 --> 02:44:14,331
[SPEAKER_23]: Mr. President, I think we've all seen after this last election that the way we've done elections in the past are no longer viable.

1916
02:44:15,530 --> 02:44:24,835
[SPEAKER_23]: Especially with the early voting for a week, the mail-in ballots, this is no longer a one-day event like it has been in the past.

1917
02:44:25,555 --> 02:44:30,157
[SPEAKER_23]: The day of using volunteers to do this is now in the past.

1918
02:44:32,218 --> 02:44:37,541
[SPEAKER_23]: I think it's time that through the clerk's office and the election department that we come up with

1919
02:44:38,601 --> 02:44:52,241
[SPEAKER_23]: some staffing requirements and some funding mechanisms to bring our election process and voting process up to this new way of doing it.

1920
02:44:55,838 --> 02:45:00,542
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, we've talked about in the past how we encourage people to vote, we encourage people to vote.

1921
02:45:00,842 --> 02:45:04,685
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, I think this primary was a tremendous turnout.

1922
02:45:05,586 --> 02:45:09,369
[SPEAKER_23]: I think we had probably one of the best primaries we had in many, many years.

1923
02:45:09,849 --> 02:45:17,035
[SPEAKER_23]: And you saw the clerk struggle with staffing problems and funding problems.

1924
02:45:17,055 --> 02:45:21,178
[SPEAKER_23]: So again, I think it's time that the clerk and his election department

1925
02:45:22,479 --> 02:45:33,023
[SPEAKER_23]: start requesting some funding and start changing the ways that we've done in the past to bring it up the way voting is going to be going forward.

1926
02:45:35,344 --> 02:45:36,184
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilor.

1927
02:45:36,485 --> 02:45:37,385
[SPEAKER_26]: Vice President Carviello.

1928
02:45:38,418 --> 02:45:38,858
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Fierros.

1929
02:45:39,038 --> 02:45:39,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1930
02:45:40,039 --> 02:45:42,400
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree with Vice President Caraballo wholeheartedly.

1931
02:45:43,321 --> 02:45:46,382
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's necessary that we get the resources down.

1932
02:45:47,303 --> 02:45:50,024
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm almost able to talk, but he's washing his window.

1933
02:45:52,786 --> 02:46:01,811
[SPEAKER_05]: I really think it's important that we get resources to City Hall, including a permanent elections coordinator, which has clearly been requested over and over again.

1934
02:46:03,012 --> 02:46:05,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Additionally, I think there are some things we could do to

1935
02:46:08,407 --> 02:46:18,014
[SPEAKER_05]: make sure that residents are more informed and have the information in a more prompt way, as well as providing these ballot drop boxes in a couple other locations other than City Hall.

1936
02:46:18,755 --> 02:46:24,239
[SPEAKER_05]: I have spoken to the clerk extensively about this and I just want to relay, you know, I think the clerk did

1937
02:46:24,779 --> 02:46:31,222
[SPEAKER_05]: a very difficult job in very difficult circumstances in a way that produced a result that we can count on.

1938
02:46:31,702 --> 02:46:34,424
[SPEAKER_05]: So I want to make that clear, but that doesn't mean that we can't do more.

1939
02:46:34,804 --> 02:46:37,485
[SPEAKER_05]: And that doesn't mean that the clerk doesn't need more to do things right.

1940
02:46:37,986 --> 02:46:39,926
[SPEAKER_05]: We know the turnout's going to be significantly higher.

1941
02:46:43,732 --> 02:46:46,574
[SPEAKER_05]: On November 3rd, I think Councilor Scarpelli is also raising his hand.

1942
02:46:48,435 --> 02:46:50,397
[SPEAKER_26]: Everybody wants to talk on this, so keep going.

1943
02:46:50,597 --> 02:46:53,719
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, again, there's a lot that we can do to help.

1944
02:46:54,080 --> 02:46:55,200
[SPEAKER_05]: I have spoken with the clerk.

1945
02:46:55,220 --> 02:47:03,867
[SPEAKER_05]: I've also spoken with Chief of Staff Dave Rodriguez, and I'm confident that efforts are going to be made to accomplish the election in a better way in November.

1946
02:47:04,047 --> 02:47:04,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1947
02:47:04,627 --> 02:47:05,848
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilor Peers.

1948
02:47:06,288 --> 02:47:12,333
[SPEAKER_26]: We have, oops, we have Councilor, Councilor Morrell.

1949
02:47:13,257 --> 02:47:14,198
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1950
02:47:14,238 --> 02:47:17,080
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and I thank my fellow counselors for bringing this forth.

1951
02:47:17,140 --> 02:47:35,475
[SPEAKER_07]: I know we all heard from many residents about this and I did, I think we've talked about communication on a number of issues around this and I think it would be beneficial and I'd like to add it in the form of amendment to get a report from the clerk's communication that can be posted on the website or shared in another way that just addresses how

1952
02:47:37,076 --> 02:47:54,547
[SPEAKER_07]: we're addressing for this upcoming election to ensure that the mistakes that happened, and I know it has to do with volume and many issues, but that the mistakes that happened for the state primary do not happen again and people can have faith in whatever option or vehicle they use to vote for the November election.

1953
02:47:54,627 --> 02:47:56,028
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'd like to add that in the form of an amendment.

1954
02:47:57,348 --> 02:47:58,149
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

1955
02:47:59,170 --> 02:47:59,630
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Knight.

1956
02:48:01,584 --> 02:48:05,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, thank you very much, and through to the city clerk and his team.

1957
02:48:06,468 --> 02:48:12,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Babe, Janice Haley, the registrars of voters, they didn't have an easy task.

1958
02:48:13,574 --> 02:48:16,917
[SPEAKER_04]: And they really didn't know what was going on until the last minute.

1959
02:48:17,697 --> 02:48:22,621
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that the state didn't help us out in allowing us ample opportunity to plan properly.

1960
02:48:23,262 --> 02:48:26,424
[SPEAKER_04]: And because of that, we met some bumps in the road and snafus.

1961
02:48:27,325 --> 02:48:29,126
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think it's important to point out.

1962
02:48:30,268 --> 02:48:38,534
[SPEAKER_04]: the hours of work that these employees put in during early voting, vote by mail, and the like, Mr. President.

1963
02:48:38,614 --> 02:48:41,816
[SPEAKER_04]: And it expands further than just the clerk's office and the registrar's office.

1964
02:48:41,836 --> 02:48:46,479
[SPEAKER_04]: So the countless volunteers that were up here hour after hour, day after day during early voting.

1965
02:48:47,360 --> 02:48:50,582
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it's important to point out that mistakes will happen and mistakes do happen.

1966
02:48:50,922 --> 02:48:57,487
[SPEAKER_04]: And as long as we identify that a mistake happened, we own it, which is one of Clerk Herderby's favorite things to do when a mistake happens.

1967
02:48:59,168 --> 02:49:01,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Provide corrective action, we're all going to be in a better place.

1968
02:49:02,391 --> 02:49:07,055
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that the clerk has the team around him that's going to allow him to do that.

1969
02:49:07,896 --> 02:49:14,382
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so with that being said, Mr. President, I know there were some bumps in the road, and I know that it could have been handled a little bit smoother.

1970
02:49:15,083 --> 02:49:18,907
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have all the confidence in the world and the team that's down there now that this won't happen again.

1971
02:49:20,748 --> 02:49:24,412
[SPEAKER_04]: But getting back to operations, and from an operational standpoint,

1972
02:49:25,551 --> 02:49:30,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Would it make sense for us, because of COVID, to condense the number of polling locations?

1973
02:49:34,970 --> 02:49:37,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a question to put out there, Mr. President.

1974
02:49:37,050 --> 02:49:45,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we need 15 polling locations when we have early voting and vote by mail, and then a lower turnout at the polls because of this?

1975
02:49:47,133 --> 02:49:48,533
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a question to chew on.

1976
02:49:48,553 --> 02:49:52,154
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a policy question that's going to have to go through the Board of Registrars of Voters.

1977
02:49:52,274 --> 02:50:00,896
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that it would probably require a homeward petition, because state law does mandate that I think there's, what, 4,000 voters per precinct, something like that.

1978
02:50:00,936 --> 02:50:02,596
[SPEAKER_04]: So it would take some work, Mr. President.

1979
02:50:02,636 --> 02:50:04,797
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't know if it's an effort worth exploring or not.

1980
02:50:05,938 --> 02:50:08,259
[SPEAKER_04]: For the simple fact that it will reduce the cost of elections.

1981
02:50:09,199 --> 02:50:14,583
[SPEAKER_04]: There's ample opportunity and time for people to come in and early vote, vote by mail, and absentee vote.

1982
02:50:16,043 --> 02:50:17,805
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can consolidate the locations.

1983
02:50:17,825 --> 02:50:21,967
[SPEAKER_04]: We won't need as much personnel, so the margin of error might be smaller, is all I'm saying.

1984
02:50:22,007 --> 02:50:27,750
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's something to talk about, something to think about, Mr. President, that I look forward to discussing at a future committee of the whole, if possible.

1985
02:50:28,791 --> 02:50:29,031
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1986
02:50:29,051 --> 02:50:29,611
[SPEAKER_26]: Counselor Knight.

1987
02:50:32,133 --> 02:50:33,774
[SPEAKER_25]: We have Counselor Marks.

1988
02:50:36,146 --> 02:50:37,127
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1989
02:50:37,187 --> 02:50:41,330
[SPEAKER_33]: I want to thank Councilor Caviello and Councilor Biaz for putting this on tonight.

1990
02:50:42,210 --> 02:50:47,174
[SPEAKER_33]: If we recall when we were deliberating the budget, it was mentioned, I know I brought it up.

1991
02:50:48,015 --> 02:50:55,100
[SPEAKER_33]: The city clerk did request for an additional position within the registrar voters office.

1992
02:50:55,820 --> 02:51:00,482
[SPEAKER_33]: It never found its way into the budget, but there was a request.

1993
02:51:01,022 --> 02:51:23,213
[SPEAKER_33]: So at the time, the city clerk realized that due to the upcoming election, the nature of the election, what's going to be requested of his office, the amount of votes that will be potentially early voting, mail-in and so forth, that it required someone from the Registrar of Voters Office to coordinate these efforts.

1994
02:51:23,753 --> 02:51:25,495
[SPEAKER_33]: which currently doesn't exist right now.

1995
02:51:26,376 --> 02:51:35,306
[SPEAKER_33]: As my colleague mentioned, you have Mrs. Joyce, you have Mrs. Lamoni in there, you have Sandy that does a great job on, I believe, a part-time basis.

1996
02:51:35,667 --> 02:51:38,250
[SPEAKER_33]: You have a number of other staff people, Mr. President.

1997
02:51:38,630 --> 02:51:39,752
[SPEAKER_33]: They did the best they could.

1998
02:51:40,212 --> 02:51:53,589
[SPEAKER_33]: But clearly, the clerk who is also the chief election officer of the community felt fit that it would require additional personnel.

1999
02:51:54,390 --> 02:51:58,596
[SPEAKER_33]: And I think the time to stand up was during the budget, now it's after the fact.

2000
02:51:59,156 --> 02:52:09,845
[SPEAKER_33]: And I think we're all looking back saying, in retrospect, we probably should have asked for that position, even though it wasn't part of the budget, but was requested as, if you want to call it a wish list.

2001
02:52:11,366 --> 02:52:24,938
[SPEAKER_33]: And that would have been an important position, Mr. President, in my opinion, to make sure that our elections are on the up and up and the integrity of our elections, which should be of the utmost importance.

2002
02:52:26,999 --> 02:52:30,622
[SPEAKER_33]: us as elected officials and as a community, Mr. President.

2003
02:52:31,102 --> 02:52:47,974
[SPEAKER_33]: So I just want to put that out there that I don't think it's too late now if we do need it, Mr. President, that we as a council can ask that the city administration, which I'm going to do in the form of a motion, that the city administration put into

2004
02:52:52,096 --> 02:52:58,958
[SPEAKER_33]: language that would put forth the position of a coordinator in the registrar or voter's office.

2005
02:52:59,738 --> 02:53:05,199
[SPEAKER_33]: And I know the city clerk has the exact title and what the job description would be, Mr. President.

2006
02:53:05,579 --> 02:53:12,922
[SPEAKER_33]: And I would ask that he supply that on this resolution back to the city administration because we know it's going to be needed.

2007
02:53:13,762 --> 02:53:17,663
[SPEAKER_33]: It's not, as my council colleagues mentioned, this is not going to get any easier.

2008
02:53:18,623 --> 02:53:21,424
[SPEAKER_33]: in November or next year or the following election.

2009
02:53:22,425 --> 02:53:27,067
[SPEAKER_33]: And the position is needed, and it's a long time coming in this community, Mr. President.

2010
02:53:27,347 --> 02:53:35,410
[SPEAKER_33]: We're able to get through elections for many years, but I think now's the time we have to, as a community, step up our game and ensure the integrity of our elections.

2011
02:53:35,890 --> 02:53:40,132
[SPEAKER_33]: And in doing so, hire the appropriate personnel to make sure that happens.

2012
02:53:40,652 --> 02:53:41,333
[SPEAKER_33]: Second, Mr. President.

2013
02:53:41,353 --> 02:53:42,293
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

2014
02:53:42,753 --> 02:53:43,974
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Marks, is that a

2015
02:53:45,274 --> 02:53:46,255
[SPEAKER_33]: That's a wrong motion.

2016
02:53:46,335 --> 02:53:48,677
[SPEAKER_26]: Is that a B paper?

2017
02:53:48,997 --> 02:53:50,678
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, if you want to make it a B paper.

2018
02:53:50,698 --> 02:53:51,779
[SPEAKER_26]: That'll be a B paper.

2019
02:53:52,059 --> 02:53:56,803
[SPEAKER_26]: It's on the motion of Council Marks' B paper, seconded by Councilor Pierson here.

2020
02:53:57,283 --> 02:53:58,764
[SPEAKER_26]: Yep.

2021
02:53:59,124 --> 02:54:00,906
[SPEAKER_26]: Clerk Hertoghez, do you have the language on the B paper?

2022
02:54:02,767 --> 02:54:03,908
[SPEAKER_22]: Hang on just a second, Mr. President.

2023
02:54:05,659 --> 02:54:18,286
[SPEAKER_22]: for the city administration to put into the budget language for election coordinator in the registrar's and voters office with the language for that position to be supplied by the city clerk.

2024
02:54:24,153 --> 02:54:32,056
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, and if I may add briefly, thank you to everyone in the clerk's office, the registrar voter's office.

2025
02:54:33,456 --> 02:54:36,698
[SPEAKER_26]: I know they are very hardworking.

2026
02:54:36,778 --> 02:54:37,938
[SPEAKER_26]: I know they go nonstop.

2027
02:54:38,678 --> 02:54:39,619
[SPEAKER_26]: They do a great job.

2028
02:54:41,039 --> 02:54:41,800
[SPEAKER_26]: Were there some issues?

2029
02:54:41,820 --> 02:54:44,020
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, but I know that the clerk has been working on that.

2030
02:54:44,741 --> 02:54:48,002
[SPEAKER_26]: And the important thing is to figure out what those issues were and

2031
02:54:48,761 --> 02:54:50,563
[SPEAKER_26]: to make sure that they don't happen again.

2032
02:54:50,603 --> 02:54:54,586
[SPEAKER_26]: I know he's been, him and his team have been working on that, and they will continue to work on that.

2033
02:54:55,106 --> 02:55:08,878
[SPEAKER_26]: I know that they will do a great job in November, but I think it is also important that the administration look at supplying additional funding to make sure that those offices have the help that they need in November.

2034
02:55:08,958 --> 02:55:15,723
[SPEAKER_26]: So I thank the councilors for bringing this resolution forward, and at this point in time, since no one has a hand up, I-

2035
02:55:18,373 --> 02:55:19,314
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Scarpelli.

2036
02:55:20,195 --> 02:55:20,836
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

2037
02:55:20,856 --> 02:55:22,218
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you for my colleagues for bringing this forward.

2038
02:55:22,238 --> 02:55:27,825
[SPEAKER_29]: I think that I too talked to City Clerk and our administration.

2039
02:55:27,865 --> 02:55:32,511
[SPEAKER_29]: I think this is important that I think Councilor Carvell hit the nail on the head.

2040
02:55:32,611 --> 02:55:33,072
[SPEAKER_29]: This isn't.

2041
02:55:34,222 --> 02:55:47,112
[SPEAKER_29]: the elections of old, and I know that when you see Adam Hurtubise like I did on election day, it hurt me just watching him pound the pavement.

2042
02:55:47,152 --> 02:55:59,721
[SPEAKER_29]: So his staff works super hard and he puts in the extra hours, but I think sometimes hard work and overdoing it hourly isn't the answer.

2043
02:55:59,861 --> 02:56:01,463
[SPEAKER_29]: I think it's making sure that we give him

2044
02:56:02,103 --> 02:56:04,264
[SPEAKER_29]: the tools that are going to make them successful.

2045
02:56:05,124 --> 02:56:13,806
[SPEAKER_29]: Because again, what you're seeing, especially in today's society, you're opening yourself up for a lot of negativity and a lot of negative feedback.

2046
02:56:14,646 --> 02:56:23,549
[SPEAKER_29]: So especially with this upcoming presidential election, we want to make sure that we have everything in order so we eliminate any of the negativity.

2047
02:56:23,609 --> 02:56:30,371
[SPEAKER_29]: So again, I appreciate it, and I thank Claire Kurterbees and the staff for

2048
02:56:31,800 --> 02:56:35,745
[SPEAKER_29]: doing the work that they do, and I concur with Councilor Moxley.

2049
02:56:35,785 --> 02:56:36,586
[SPEAKER_29]: I think it's a great idea.

2050
02:56:36,626 --> 02:56:37,327
[SPEAKER_29]: We move forward with it.

2051
02:56:37,668 --> 02:56:37,968
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

2052
02:56:38,469 --> 02:56:39,970
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

2053
02:56:40,010 --> 02:56:43,455
[SPEAKER_26]: We have, let's see, we have, I believe it's Marjorie wants to speak.

2054
02:56:43,495 --> 02:56:45,678
[SPEAKER_26]: Marjorie, name and address for the record, please.

2055
02:56:48,104 --> 02:56:50,986
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, my name is Marcia Shearson.

2056
02:56:51,587 --> 02:56:54,449
[SPEAKER_10]: I live at 11 Upton Terrace in Redford.

2057
02:56:55,270 --> 02:57:02,336
[SPEAKER_10]: And I thank all of you for listening to me as you have many times in the past.

2058
02:57:03,077 --> 02:57:15,347
[SPEAKER_10]: This is an incredibly important issue to me because this is the most crucial election that's ever happened in my lifetime, which is longer than you might think.

2059
02:57:16,558 --> 02:57:45,609
[SPEAKER_10]: And my particular concern was around having sufficient ballot boxes supervised, if possible, around the city so that people who are unable to vote in person or maybe voting for the first time and not have transportation be able to cast their vote.

2060
02:57:47,210 --> 02:57:57,920
[SPEAKER_10]: And I thank you all for bringing this issue to your attention and all of your interest.

2061
02:57:58,640 --> 02:58:09,630
[SPEAKER_10]: The other concern I have is that there is a possibility that there may be more poll watching happening

2062
02:58:11,852 --> 02:58:12,413
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

2063
02:58:41,045 --> 02:58:44,468
[SPEAKER_26]: Melissa Young, name and address for the record, Melissa.

2064
02:58:45,549 --> 02:58:52,594
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, I'm Melissa Young, I'm at 68 Bolton Street, and I also sent in a letter, so I won't go into detail, and you guys have it for the record.

2065
02:58:53,135 --> 02:58:55,917
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to say I would encourage you to support this resolution.

2066
02:58:55,937 --> 02:59:05,204
[SPEAKER_15]: I worked the March election, so I would also go ahead and say that I would not recommend reducing the number of polling locations, whether or not they get added on.

2067
02:59:05,945 --> 02:59:06,866
[SPEAKER_15]: That's another story.

2068
02:59:07,546 --> 02:59:12,929
[SPEAKER_15]: But we aligned at the door during the March election, and that was even nearly as busy as the previous election.

2069
02:59:12,949 --> 02:59:18,332
[SPEAKER_15]: In addition, a coordinator would help the city in just getting the communication on.

2070
02:59:19,083 --> 02:59:32,889
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, when you have a dedicated staff member and this is their role to modernize things, things just happen faster.

2071
02:59:32,909 --> 02:59:34,730
[SPEAKER_15]: I just would encourage you to support it.

2072
02:59:35,230 --> 02:59:40,633
[SPEAKER_15]: And I have more examples in my letter to support, but I just wanted to provide that information.

2073
02:59:41,033 --> 02:59:41,333
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2074
02:59:49,973 --> 02:59:53,916
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, Councilor Marks.

2075
02:59:54,677 --> 02:59:56,478
[SPEAKER_26]: Do you all set, Councilor Marks, just to make sure.

2076
02:59:56,718 --> 02:59:57,359
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, thank you.

2077
02:59:59,020 --> 03:00:00,581
[SPEAKER_26]: I wasn't, did you have your hand up earlier or no?

2078
03:00:01,382 --> 03:00:02,282
[SPEAKER_26]: Clerk Carter-Bees, I wasn't.

2079
03:00:02,663 --> 03:00:03,704
[SPEAKER_26]: No, okay, perfect, okay.

2080
03:00:04,724 --> 03:00:06,566
[SPEAKER_26]: On the motion, so there's a number of papers here.

2081
03:00:06,606 --> 03:00:14,892
[SPEAKER_26]: So on the B paper that was offered by Councilor Knight, I'm sorry, Councilor Marks, and it was seconded by, I believe it was Councilor Beers.

2082
03:00:17,294 --> 03:00:18,555
[SPEAKER_26]: Clerk Carter-Bees, can you please call the roll?

2083
03:00:20,368 --> 03:00:20,948
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Behrs.

2084
03:00:25,431 --> 03:00:26,351
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Behrs, I didn't hear you.

2085
03:00:27,091 --> 03:00:29,072
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Behrs left the room.

2086
03:00:29,833 --> 03:00:30,233
[SPEAKER_22]: OK.

2087
03:00:30,893 --> 03:00:32,934
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, that explains why I didn't hear him.

2088
03:00:33,114 --> 03:00:34,055
[SPEAKER_22]: Vice President Caraballo.

2089
03:00:34,295 --> 03:00:34,475
Yes.

2090
03:00:36,336 --> 03:00:36,556
Yes.

2091
03:00:37,957 --> 03:00:38,497
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Mike.

2092
03:00:38,857 --> 03:00:39,137
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

2093
03:00:40,298 --> 03:00:40,918
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Marks.

2094
03:00:41,118 --> 03:00:41,419
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

2095
03:00:42,699 --> 03:00:43,360
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Morrell.

2096
03:00:43,640 --> 03:00:43,900
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

2097
03:00:45,000 --> 03:00:45,841
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Scarpelli.

2098
03:00:46,021 --> 03:00:46,341
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

2099
03:00:47,182 --> 03:00:47,862
[SPEAKER_22]: President Falco.

2100
03:00:49,592 --> 03:00:51,934
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, and Councilor Beers just walked into the room.

2101
03:00:51,954 --> 03:00:52,014
Yes.

2102
03:00:53,775 --> 03:00:54,355
[SPEAKER_22]: Was that a yes?

2103
03:00:54,515 --> 03:00:55,135
[SPEAKER_26]: That was a yes.

2104
03:00:57,677 --> 03:00:58,658
[SPEAKER_22]: OK, that's on the B paper.

2105
03:00:58,678 --> 03:00:59,658
[SPEAKER_26]: 7, the affirmative.

2106
03:00:59,678 --> 03:01:00,279
[SPEAKER_26]: 0, the negative.

2107
03:01:00,299 --> 03:01:01,900
[SPEAKER_26]: The motion passes on the B paper.

2108
03:01:02,480 --> 03:01:11,125
[SPEAKER_26]: On the main motion that was offered by, actually, by Vice President Caviello and Councilor Beers.

2109
03:01:11,165 --> 03:01:13,667
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, I offer an amendment.

2110
03:01:13,967 --> 03:01:15,008
[SPEAKER_07]: Did it get a second?

2111
03:01:15,748 --> 03:01:17,990
[SPEAKER_07]: I offer an amendment.

2112
03:01:19,093 --> 03:01:19,713
[SPEAKER_07]: You offer an amendment?

2113
03:01:19,933 --> 03:01:20,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, to knock it.

2114
03:01:20,994 --> 03:01:22,655
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't remember if it's a second or not.

2115
03:01:23,135 --> 03:01:23,855
[SPEAKER_07]: On the main paper?

2116
03:01:24,035 --> 03:01:25,176
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, on the main paper.

2117
03:01:25,316 --> 03:01:25,836
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, OK.

2118
03:01:26,136 --> 03:01:29,218
[SPEAKER_22]: So Councilor Morrell had an amendment to the main paper.

2119
03:01:29,238 --> 03:01:29,978
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, I get it here.

2120
03:01:30,018 --> 03:01:34,841
[SPEAKER_26]: So on the motion of Vice President Carbiello and Councilor Behr, seconded by?

2121
03:01:34,861 --> 03:01:35,001
[SPEAKER_26]: Second.

2122
03:01:36,522 --> 03:01:37,022
[SPEAKER_26]: What's the second?

2123
03:01:37,042 --> 03:01:39,403
[SPEAKER_26]: As amended by Councilor Morrell?

2124
03:01:39,483 --> 03:01:42,505
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, as amended by Councilor Morrell.

2125
03:01:44,145 --> 03:01:45,226
[SPEAKER_26]: Clerk Herderby, please call the roll.

2126
03:01:45,986 --> 03:01:47,027

03:01:49,458 --> 03:01:50,719
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Scott Kelly.

2128
03:01:51,339 --> 03:01:51,699

[SPEAKER_22]: Vice President Caraballo.

03:02:02,584 --> 03:02:02,844
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

2135
03:02:03,564 --> 03:02:03,944
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

2136
03:02:05,045 --> 03:02:05,585
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Night.

2137
03:02:05,925 --> 03:02:06,185
[SPEAKER_30]: Yes.

2138
03:02:07,266 --> 03:02:07,886
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Marks.

2139
03:02:08,226 --> 03:02:08,526
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

2140
03:02:09,266 --> 03:02:09,907
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Morrell.

2141
03:02:10,187 --> 03:02:10,407
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

2142
03:02:11,440 --> 03:02:12,220
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Scarpelli?

2143
03:02:12,541 --> 03:02:12,821
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

2144
03:02:13,521 --> 03:02:14,301
[SPEAKER_22]: President Falco?

2145
03:02:14,501 --> 03:02:14,762
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

2146
03:02:14,862 --> 03:02:16,322
[SPEAKER_26]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

2147
03:02:16,342 --> 03:02:17,163
[SPEAKER_26]: The motion passes.

2148
03:02:17,183 --> 03:02:20,224
[SPEAKER_26]: 2-0-532 offered by Vice President Caviello.

2149
03:02:21,365 --> 03:02:28,148
[SPEAKER_26]: Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council have the DCR repair the guardrail on Route 16 bridge in Auburn Street in the interest of public safety.

2150
03:02:29,329 --> 03:02:30,069
[SPEAKER_26]: Vice President Caviello.

2151
03:02:37,258 --> 03:02:38,039
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2152
03:02:38,060 --> 03:02:41,827
[SPEAKER_23]: Mr. President, this is something I put on about eight months ago.

2153
03:02:42,909 --> 03:02:45,894
[SPEAKER_23]: And it took a while to fix, and it was fixed.

2154
03:02:45,994 --> 03:02:49,441
[SPEAKER_23]: And three months later, the guardrail has been hit again.

2155
03:02:50,657 --> 03:02:51,638
[SPEAKER_23]: Just that spot.

2156
03:02:52,038 --> 03:03:00,785
[SPEAKER_23]: And again, the guardrail is on the side, it's broken onto the sidewalk and it's making it hard for people to traverse.

2157
03:03:01,186 --> 03:03:14,517
[SPEAKER_23]: So again, if we could refer this to Representative Garbling's office, I did speak to him briefly about it, but if you could send him an official thing in the DCR to have this repaired again in the interest of public safety.

2158
03:03:15,417 --> 03:03:16,018
[SPEAKER_23]: And Mr. President,

2159
03:03:19,365 --> 03:03:32,009
[SPEAKER_23]: While we're sending something to the DCR in to Representative Godley, on August 11th, I made a resolution, 20474, about removing the trees in the river.

2160
03:03:32,769 --> 03:03:37,011
[SPEAKER_23]: Because Paddle Boston's there, and a lot of people kayak and everything.

2161
03:03:37,671 --> 03:03:40,632
[SPEAKER_23]: It never went to the DCR, it ended up going to Aggie Jordan.

2162
03:03:42,053 --> 03:03:47,236
[SPEAKER_23]: And she wrote back that she has no jurisdiction over the waterway and the trees.

2163
03:03:47,256 --> 03:03:53,740
[SPEAKER_23]: So I think this 20474 should have gone to Representative Gabbard and the DCR.

2164
03:03:54,721 --> 03:04:00,684
[SPEAKER_23]: So if you want to combine these two together, when the clerk sends this paper to both offices.

2165
03:04:00,884 --> 03:04:05,868
[SPEAKER_26]: So why don't we amend it to have that paper sent to the correct agency to have the tree taken care of.

2166
03:04:05,888 --> 03:04:06,128
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

2167
03:04:11,218 --> 03:04:17,401
[SPEAKER_26]: So on the motion of Vice President Caviello, seconded by Councilor Behrs, is amended by Vice President Caviello.

2168
03:04:17,421 --> 03:04:18,461
[SPEAKER_26]: Clerk, please call the roll.

2169
03:04:24,163 --> 03:04:24,764
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Behrs?

2170
03:04:25,564 --> 03:04:25,804
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

2171
03:04:26,664 --> 03:04:27,585
[SPEAKER_22]: Vice President Caviello?

2172
03:04:27,745 --> 03:04:28,045
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

2173
03:04:29,245 --> 03:04:29,766
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Knight?

2174
03:04:29,786 --> 03:04:32,947
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

2175
03:04:32,967 --> 03:04:33,527
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Marks?

2176
03:04:33,787 --> 03:04:34,047
Yes.

2177
03:04:34,848 --> 03:04:35,428
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Morrell?

2178
03:04:35,708 --> 03:04:35,988
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

2179
03:04:36,708 --> 03:04:37,429
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Scarpelli?

2180
03:04:37,629 --> 03:04:37,809
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

2181
03:04:38,910 --> 03:04:39,574
[SPEAKER_22]: President Falco.

2182
03:04:39,635 --> 03:04:42,291
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

2183
03:04:44,307 --> 03:04:48,610
[SPEAKER_26]: 2-0-533 offered by Vice President Caviello be resolved at the Memphis City Council.

2184
03:04:48,630 --> 03:04:57,395
[SPEAKER_26]: Have the school department have the two collection bins at the Andrews School emptied as soon as possible in the interest of public health.

2185
03:04:58,075 --> 03:04:58,375
[SPEAKER_23]: Mr. Caviello?

2186
03:04:58,415 --> 03:04:58,996
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2187
03:04:59,416 --> 03:05:06,420
[SPEAKER_23]: Mr. President, I was by the Andrews School last week, and they have two collection bins there, and they're overflowing.

2188
03:05:07,561 --> 03:05:08,981
[SPEAKER_23]: And all along the side of them is all,

2189
03:05:10,923 --> 03:05:14,965
[SPEAKER_23]: These have gone from collection bins to garbage dumps now.

2190
03:05:15,406 --> 03:05:18,948
[SPEAKER_23]: There's furniture there, there's car seats.

2191
03:05:19,569 --> 03:05:22,851
[SPEAKER_23]: I think they've kind of gone a different way.

2192
03:05:23,211 --> 03:05:33,138
[SPEAKER_23]: And I know we did receive communication from the mayor's office about something I offered last year about ordinances for the collection bins.

2193
03:05:33,458 --> 03:05:34,399
[SPEAKER_23]: So I'm glad to see.

2194
03:05:36,140 --> 03:05:38,200
[SPEAKER_23]: The motion that I made last year has gone up.

2195
03:05:38,501 --> 03:05:42,361
[SPEAKER_23]: But again, this is at the school, it looks horrible when you drive by there.

2196
03:05:42,862 --> 03:05:47,723
[SPEAKER_23]: There's all rubbish between all of them, and there's road instead of going in and out of there.

2197
03:05:47,743 --> 03:05:49,943
[SPEAKER_23]: So if we could have that taken care of, I'd appreciate it.

2198
03:05:49,963 --> 03:05:52,004
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Vice President Caviello.

2199
03:05:53,684 --> 03:05:54,444
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilmate.

2200
03:05:54,464 --> 03:05:55,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, I second the motion.

[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

2202
03:05:59,112 --> 03:06:02,253
[SPEAKER_26]: Any questions from the council any questions in general?

2203
03:06:02,273 --> 03:06:11,555
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay on the emotion of vice-president cabio seconded by a council and I correct her to be please call the roll That's a bears.

2204
03:06:11,715 --> 03:06:22,317
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes vice-president care of y'all Thank You council night yes, that's a marks Council Morrell.

2205
03:06:22,677 --> 03:06:24,358
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, that's a star pellet.

2206
03:06:24,598 --> 03:06:24,818
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, I

2207
03:06:25,580 --> 03:06:26,281
[SPEAKER_22]: President Falco.

2208
03:06:26,401 --> 03:06:26,662
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

2209
03:06:26,942 --> 03:06:29,125
[SPEAKER_26]: Sending the affirmative, zeroing the negative, the motion passes.

2210
03:06:29,145 --> 03:06:31,889
[SPEAKER_26]: 20-534 offered by Councilor Behrs.

2211
03:06:31,949 --> 03:06:39,140
[SPEAKER_26]: Whereas the new Ball Square MBTA Green Line is designed as a walkable transit station for the South Memphis neighborhood.

2212
03:06:39,280 --> 03:06:41,944
[SPEAKER_26]: And whereas pedestrian safety and infrastructure conditions.

2213
03:06:42,404 --> 03:06:49,450
[SPEAKER_26]: require improvements to support the transit-oriented mixed-use development in multimodal reality of the new station.

2214
03:06:49,510 --> 03:07:09,967
[SPEAKER_26]: Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the representatives of the Office of Community Development, Community Development Board, Greenline Extension Project, Building Commissioner, and South Medford residents together meet with the City Council and Committee of the Whole to discuss a district plan for the Ball Square-Foster Avenue corridor.

2215
03:07:10,569 --> 03:07:11,149
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Behrs.

2216
03:07:11,389 --> 03:07:12,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2217
03:07:12,790 --> 03:07:19,973
[SPEAKER_05]: So as we're aware, the Green Line Extension Project is well underway, nearing completion, hopefully next year if all targets are met.

2218
03:07:20,794 --> 03:07:25,896
[SPEAKER_05]: The stations in Medford, the Ball Square station is actually mostly in Medford, and of course the

2219
03:07:27,022 --> 03:07:33,324
[SPEAKER_05]: Hillside or the Tufts station, I believe Medford Tufts is what it's called, you know, they are walkable stations.

2220
03:07:33,404 --> 03:07:36,165
[SPEAKER_05]: There is not parking designated for those stations.

2221
03:07:36,245 --> 03:07:43,648
[SPEAKER_05]: So they are designed to be walked to and use other modes of transportation like buses and bikes.

2222
03:07:44,629 --> 03:07:50,131
[SPEAKER_05]: The intent of this resolution is after speaking to some folks in the area and also some

2223
03:07:51,123 --> 03:07:59,293
[SPEAKER_05]: developments with development in the area, really taking a hard look at making a district plan for the region along Boston Ave near Ball Square.

2224
03:07:59,954 --> 03:08:05,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, Somerville has just gone through a major rezoning that's going to significantly affect traffic into Medford.

2225
03:08:06,081 --> 03:08:08,304
[SPEAKER_05]: So the proposal here is that we would meet in Committee of the Whole.

2226
03:08:08,788 --> 03:08:21,660
[SPEAKER_05]: to discuss a district plan that would include transportation improvements, zoning, all the things that would need to go into really updating what we do in that area.

2227
03:08:21,980 --> 03:08:30,248
[SPEAKER_05]: One part of the Green Line extension is that around these walkable stations, the MBTA is really supposed to work with the local authorities, with the municipality.

2228
03:08:30,848 --> 03:08:33,610
[SPEAKER_05]: to make significant improvements around the stations.

2229
03:08:33,890 --> 03:08:45,476
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we want to do that as part of a coherent plan, addressing concerns of neighbors, as well as addressing, you know, kind of some of the new opportunities we might have around growth, around development, around improving the area.

2230
03:08:46,216 --> 03:08:52,379
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, that's the intent here, meeting committee of the whole with representatives who have a stake in this, and I move approval.

2231
03:08:55,400 --> 03:08:56,241
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Council Members.

2232
03:08:58,852 --> 03:09:00,533
[SPEAKER_26]: On the motion, any questions?

2233
03:09:00,573 --> 03:09:01,233
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, we have a question.

2234
03:09:01,273 --> 03:09:03,113
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, we actually, let's see, Laurel Ruma.

2235
03:09:05,714 --> 03:09:06,114
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

2236
03:09:06,254 --> 03:09:07,935
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you so much.

2237
03:09:07,955 --> 03:09:12,876
[SPEAKER_16]: I would please ask that the resolution be changed to include the station stops of Medford-Tufts.

2238
03:09:13,617 --> 03:09:19,198
[SPEAKER_16]: Medford does have two Greenline stations here in Medford, which is a fantastic part of the Greenline extension.

2239
03:09:20,159 --> 03:09:24,720
[SPEAKER_16]: Ball Square in South Medford, and then Medford-Tufts at College and Boston Avenue.

2240
03:09:26,780 --> 03:09:31,301
[SPEAKER_16]: this project is that people will come from at least a mile radius to the station.

2241
03:09:31,341 --> 03:09:36,782
[SPEAKER_16]: And again, because there's no parking at the train station, people will be walking and riding bikes.

2242
03:09:36,862 --> 03:09:40,203
[SPEAKER_16]: So just like to make sure the resolution actually includes both of the train stations.

2243
03:09:40,403 --> 03:09:40,703
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2244
03:09:41,383 --> 03:09:41,683
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

2245
03:09:42,343 --> 03:09:43,183
[SPEAKER_16]: One last thing.

2246
03:09:43,703 --> 03:09:43,863
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

2247
03:09:43,883 --> 03:09:48,764
[SPEAKER_16]: We're on budget and on time to have the trains running by December 2021.

2248
03:09:48,804 --> 03:09:49,844
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're a year away.

2249
03:09:49,864 --> 03:09:51,865
[SPEAKER_16]: Almost there.

2250
03:09:54,603 --> 03:09:54,903
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

2251
03:09:54,923 --> 03:10:05,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Laurel, and I'd be happy to amend the paper to add the, you know, Medford-Tufts station and to look at all the way down to Boston Ave to the Medford-Tufts station.

2252
03:10:05,289 --> 03:10:06,210
[SPEAKER_26]: So you want to amend it?

2253
03:10:06,270 --> 03:10:06,570
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

2254
03:10:06,710 --> 03:10:07,671
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

2255
03:10:09,812 --> 03:10:11,053
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, let's see.

2256
03:10:11,073 --> 03:10:11,553
[SPEAKER_26]: Counselor Knight.

2257
03:10:11,573 --> 03:10:13,554
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we invite Tufts University to the meeting as well?

2258
03:10:14,715 --> 03:10:14,895
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

2259
03:10:15,075 --> 03:10:16,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Given the circumstances, yeah, that makes sense.

2260
03:10:23,602 --> 03:10:31,507
[SPEAKER_26]: OK, so we'll see you on the motion of Councilor Behrs, seconded by Councilor Morrell, as amended by Councilors Behrs and Councilor Night.

2261
03:10:32,507 --> 03:10:34,909
[SPEAKER_26]: On that motion, Clerk Hurnabys, please call the roll.

2262
03:10:37,871 --> 03:10:38,451
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Behrs.

2263
03:10:38,991 --> 03:10:39,272
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

2264
03:10:39,972 --> 03:10:41,693
[SPEAKER_22]: Vice President Caravaglia.

2265
03:10:42,073 --> 03:10:42,273
[SPEAKER_30]: Yes.

2266
03:10:44,014 --> 03:10:44,535
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Night.

2267
03:10:44,655 --> 03:10:45,175
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

2268
03:10:47,176 --> 03:10:47,777
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Marks.

2269
03:10:48,057 --> 03:10:48,317
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

2270
03:10:49,718 --> 03:10:52,199
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Morrell.

2271
03:10:52,620 --> 03:10:52,860
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

2272
03:10:54,430 --> 03:10:55,330
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Scarpelli?

2273
03:10:55,450 --> 03:10:55,791
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

2274
03:10:56,791 --> 03:10:57,591
[SPEAKER_22]: President Falco?

2275
03:10:57,891 --> 03:10:58,152
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

2276
03:10:58,392 --> 03:11:00,132
[SPEAKER_26]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

2277
03:11:00,273 --> 03:11:02,553
[SPEAKER_26]: The motion passes.

2278
03:11:02,573 --> 03:11:19,921
[SPEAKER_26]: 2-0-535 offered by Council of Bears be it resolved that President Falco meet with the Board of Health to define what public health metrics will be used to determine the ability of the council to meet in council chambers or if the council must meet in a virtual setting and how often they will be considered.

2279
03:11:20,620 --> 03:11:30,983
[SPEAKER_26]: Be it further resolved that President Falco meet with the Board of Health to define what conditions and public health measures will be used to determine whether members of the public can attend meetings in council chambers.

2280
03:11:31,543 --> 03:11:39,405
[SPEAKER_26]: Be it further resolved that President Falco and the Board of Health work with the city solicitor to ensure compliance with state law regulations and emergency orders.

2281
03:11:40,685 --> 03:11:41,385
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Behrs.

2282
03:11:41,985 --> 03:11:42,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2283
03:11:42,925 --> 03:11:47,667
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think this issue has come up a lot from a lot of folks, including myself.

2284
03:11:49,516 --> 03:11:53,337
[SPEAKER_05]: And it goes back to something that was said earlier around having options.

2285
03:11:53,578 --> 03:11:56,238
[SPEAKER_05]: We have options around these meetings.

2286
03:11:56,439 --> 03:12:05,682
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we've added another option, which is not without its flaws in this meeting hybrid that we're having right now, which has its own issues as well as Zoom.

2287
03:12:05,962 --> 03:12:07,963
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think the views of

2288
03:12:08,821 --> 03:12:11,603
[SPEAKER_05]: What public health says, we have not chosen the safest option.

2289
03:12:12,684 --> 03:12:19,029
[SPEAKER_05]: We have not chosen the option to meet virtually, not meet in person, which would be the safest option.

2290
03:12:19,790 --> 03:12:26,715
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'd like to have some public health metrics and guidance around this beyond just let's meet in the chamber.

2291
03:12:26,775 --> 03:12:27,836
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't have the public here.

2292
03:12:27,936 --> 03:12:29,297
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't have any of our guests here.

2293
03:12:29,797 --> 03:12:36,202
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me tell you, sitting over here between four different barriers trying to look at this TV screen and see what people are saying is, you know,

2294
03:12:37,243 --> 03:12:41,045
[SPEAKER_05]: not the easiest thing in the world when my glasses are fogged up because I'm wearing my mask.

2295
03:12:41,165 --> 03:12:48,727
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's benefits and costs to all of the models that we've looked at so far with Zoom and the hybrid model.

2296
03:12:49,888 --> 03:12:54,289
[SPEAKER_05]: I think given that fact that neither is perfect, we should be taking the safest choice.

2297
03:12:54,830 --> 03:12:57,151
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's what my resolution is intended to do.

2298
03:12:57,831 --> 03:13:03,693
[SPEAKER_05]: And quite frankly, I've received several messages tonight asking why some counselors are wearing masks and others aren't.

2299
03:13:04,173 --> 03:13:05,734
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would also propose a B paper

2300
03:13:06,374 --> 03:13:09,837
[SPEAKER_05]: that the Council President mandate masks behind the rail while we're meeting.

2301
03:13:19,606 --> 03:13:25,612
[SPEAKER_31]: That's not how this works.

2302
03:13:25,992 --> 03:13:26,693
[SPEAKER_31]: Mr. President.

2303
03:13:27,814 --> 03:13:28,975
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, thank you Councilor Knight.

2304
03:13:33,122 --> 03:13:35,284
[SPEAKER_26]: We have Councilor Morrell and then Councilor Scott Kelly, I'm sorry.

2305
03:13:35,464 --> 03:13:37,425
[SPEAKER_26]: I got the names mixed up on the screen, so.

2306
03:13:37,926 --> 03:13:38,787
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2307
03:13:38,807 --> 03:13:43,250
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to thank Councilor Behrs for bringing this forth, because it is a reminder that it's not just us in here.

2308
03:13:43,390 --> 03:13:44,131
[SPEAKER_07]: It's our families.

2309
03:13:44,191 --> 03:13:47,994
[SPEAKER_07]: It's everyone we interact with in those essential activities.

2310
03:13:48,214 --> 03:13:53,939
[SPEAKER_07]: So any time you bring together X number of people, you increase the rate of potential transmission.

2311
03:13:53,999 --> 03:13:56,281
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it's just important to note, it's not just us.

2312
03:13:56,361 --> 03:13:58,102
[SPEAKER_07]: It's everyone we interact with in the community.

2313
03:13:58,462 --> 03:13:59,503
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's a public health issue.

2314
03:13:59,643 --> 03:13:59,964
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2315
03:14:00,713 --> 03:14:01,754
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

2316
03:14:02,034 --> 03:14:03,915
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Scarpelli.

2317
03:14:05,016 --> 03:14:21,506
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Falco, to keep things positive, we are in a chambers where we are protected by glass, with an open seat, where I am at least 8 to 10 feet away from Councilor Knight.

2318
03:14:22,426 --> 03:14:24,367
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm 15 feet away from Councilor Morrell.

2319
03:14:24,647 --> 03:14:25,968
[SPEAKER_29]: There's nobody else around me.

2320
03:14:27,629 --> 03:14:28,470
[SPEAKER_29]: No one else around me.

2321
03:14:29,907 --> 03:14:32,470
[SPEAKER_29]: There's PPE equipment all over the room that we can use.

2322
03:14:33,791 --> 03:14:39,618
[SPEAKER_30]: CDC guidelines has me run camps every day with up to 50 kids.

2323
03:14:42,112 --> 03:15:00,620
[SPEAKER_30]: using these schematics, these guidelines, to say that this is any way dangerous because the ruling of social media again spewing negativity is a shame.

2324
03:15:00,700 --> 03:15:01,580
[SPEAKER_31]: Stay positive.

2325
03:15:02,461 --> 03:15:07,683
[SPEAKER_29]: We agree with Councilor Beas with having the opportunity to have many options that people need.

2326
03:15:08,743 --> 03:15:15,646
[SPEAKER_31]: But what he seems to return over and over again, that there are people that don't do Zoom.

2327
03:15:17,026 --> 03:15:28,410
[SPEAKER_29]: So even if there's people scattered out here, six feet apart, and even if it's the five people that can't make these meetings, this is the reason why we had the issue months ago at the budget meetings.

2328
03:15:28,830 --> 03:15:31,631
[SPEAKER_29]: Cuz people have an option to come to these chambers.

2329
03:15:35,942 --> 03:15:38,723
[SPEAKER_05]: I am positive that I do not want to be COVID positive.

2330
03:15:38,923 --> 03:15:39,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2331
03:15:40,304 --> 03:15:50,867
[SPEAKER_31]: Hypocrisy is amazing, but going forward, going forward, this is, this is, this is the city's forum.

2332
03:15:51,167 --> 03:16:00,130
[SPEAKER_31]: So like I said, I appreciate my fellow council talking about having people have the opinion to stay healthy and choosing zoom.

2333
03:16:00,230 --> 03:16:00,950
[SPEAKER_31]: I understand that.

2334
03:16:02,314 --> 03:16:04,435
[SPEAKER_31]: Whether I like it or not, I understand it, and I support it.

2335
03:16:04,855 --> 03:16:16,200
[SPEAKER_31]: But at the same time, if it's one, or two, or three, or five, or 25 people that want to come to this forum because they won't do this Zoom, they have an opportunity too.

2336
03:16:16,260 --> 03:16:18,961
[SPEAKER_31]: So I look forward to sitting with the Board of Health.

2337
03:16:19,341 --> 03:16:20,001
[SPEAKER_31]: I appreciate that.

2338
03:16:20,021 --> 03:16:20,541
[SPEAKER_31]: I welcome that.

2339
03:16:20,901 --> 03:16:29,285
[SPEAKER_31]: I'll vote in support of that 1,000%, because I want to hear the Board of Health person, the board members, going to tell me that you're going to allow 400 people in a school

2340
03:16:30,900 --> 03:16:32,401
[SPEAKER_31]: But you're not going to lock people here.

2341
03:16:33,262 --> 03:16:34,162
[SPEAKER_31]: People voted here.

2342
03:16:34,602 --> 03:16:37,024
[SPEAKER_31]: People volunteered here with no fear.

2343
03:16:37,805 --> 03:16:38,625
[SPEAKER_31]: No fear at all.

2344
03:16:39,346 --> 03:16:40,607
[SPEAKER_31]: Hypocrisy is amazing.

2345
03:16:41,987 --> 03:16:42,888
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2346
03:16:42,928 --> 03:16:45,770
[SPEAKER_31]: Point of information, Mr. President.

2347
03:16:45,810 --> 03:16:47,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of information, Mr. President.

2348
03:16:47,491 --> 03:16:50,453
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, I mean, that's a false equivalence.

2349
03:16:50,493 --> 03:16:51,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are not the same things.

2350
03:16:51,594 --> 03:16:52,955
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been sitting and, yeah, it is.

2351
03:16:52,995 --> 03:16:58,679
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we can talk about it or not, but you can't compare two entirely different things and say they're the same thing and then call someone a hypocrite.

2352
03:16:58,779 --> 03:17:00,660
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just not true, Counselor Scarpelli.

2353
03:17:01,140 --> 03:17:11,304
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we want to talk about how this virus spreads, it's a lot of people sitting in this, do you think this glass is protecting anyone in a long term when airborne particles and droplets are spreading?

2354
03:17:11,344 --> 03:17:13,965
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's just not based in the science around how this spreads.

2355
03:17:14,245 --> 03:17:16,146
[SPEAKER_05]: And quite frankly, I'm the youngest one here.

2356
03:17:16,486 --> 03:17:17,266
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm wearing a mask.

2357
03:17:17,586 --> 03:17:19,387
[SPEAKER_05]: If you wear a mask, it's to protect other people.

2358
03:17:19,547 --> 03:17:20,667
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm at the least risk here.

2359
03:17:20,887 --> 03:17:27,850
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just saying, I don't think we want to be in a situation where there are counselors who are sick and God forbid there's four counselors who are sick.

2360
03:17:27,890 --> 03:17:29,611
[SPEAKER_05]: And I understand that, you know,

2361
03:17:30,451 --> 03:17:31,712
[SPEAKER_05]: Other people may feel differently.

2362
03:17:31,732 --> 03:17:33,252
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think this is a time for feelings.

2363
03:17:33,312 --> 03:17:35,394
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is a time for science and public health.

2364
03:17:37,875 --> 03:17:39,996
[SPEAKER_26]: We have Councilor Morrell and then Councilor Marks.

2365
03:17:41,063 --> 03:17:41,803
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Morrell.

2366
03:17:42,084 --> 03:17:42,844
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2367
03:17:42,884 --> 03:17:47,226
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, this is really an innocuous, ironically, an innocuous resolution.

2368
03:17:47,246 --> 03:17:53,449
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think there is, you know, the research and studies are still coming out, to Councilor Behr's point, about how this transmits.

2369
03:17:53,909 --> 03:17:57,491
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, these, you know, you look at any spray, this actually doesn't do anything.

2370
03:17:57,511 --> 03:18:06,716
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're sitting in recirculated air, so we can't sit here and say, we just had long conversations about the air quality in the high school, and then it's,

2371
03:18:08,019 --> 03:18:21,235
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm at a loss for words here, because again, this is a very innocuous, have a conversation, look at some metrics, how do we move forward, resolution, and it shouldn't inspire this level of ire and anger and finger pointing.

2372
03:18:22,157 --> 03:18:23,358
[SPEAKER_29]: Point of information, Mr. President.

2373
03:18:23,378 --> 03:18:25,279
[SPEAKER_29]: Point of information, Mr. President.

2374
03:18:25,299 --> 03:18:26,860
[SPEAKER_26]: Point of information, thank you, Councilor Morrell.

2375
03:18:27,100 --> 03:18:29,382
[SPEAKER_26]: Point of information, Councilor Scott-Pelley.

2376
03:18:29,402 --> 03:18:40,809
[SPEAKER_29]: The intent of the resolution was fine, but to respond that people and social media responding to our fellow colleagues and saying even that I'm masked, that's a joke, that's hypocrisy.

2377
03:18:42,210 --> 03:18:42,530
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

2378
03:18:42,750 --> 03:18:43,871
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilor Scott-Pelley.

2379
03:18:43,891 --> 03:18:44,551
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Marks.

2380
03:18:45,052 --> 03:18:46,112
[SPEAKER_32]: Mr. President.

2381
03:18:50,255 --> 03:18:50,795
[SPEAKER_25]: It is on now.

2382
03:18:50,815 --> 03:18:51,136
[SPEAKER_25]: One second.

2383
03:18:53,821 --> 03:19:02,610
[SPEAKER_33]: Mr. President, did you not meet or was the Board of Health Director not in this chamber and gave approval to this set up, Mr. President?

2384
03:19:02,630 --> 03:19:03,511
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, correct, correct.

2385
03:19:03,531 --> 03:19:06,394
[SPEAKER_26]: So if I may really quickly- Mr. President, if I could.

2386
03:19:07,075 --> 03:19:15,923
[SPEAKER_33]: Can you not go to a restaurant, indoor or outdoor, and sit six feet from someone else without plexiglass, Mr. President?

2387
03:19:17,963 --> 03:19:23,508
[SPEAKER_33]: Have we not been told, Mr. President, that we can't exceed 25 people in this chamber, Mr. President?

2388
03:19:23,728 --> 03:19:24,068
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.

2389
03:19:24,709 --> 03:19:26,851
[SPEAKER_33]: Do we exceed those numbers, Mr. President?

2390
03:19:27,271 --> 03:19:31,395
[SPEAKER_33]: Have we adhered to all the rules and regulations, Mr. President?

2391
03:19:32,216 --> 03:19:38,701
[SPEAKER_33]: If my colleague wants to stick his head in the sand, but meanwhile attend every rally possible,

2392
03:19:39,682 --> 03:19:43,143
[SPEAKER_33]: Everywhere, we've got hundreds of people gliding in and shaking hands.

2393
03:19:43,863 --> 03:19:45,364
[SPEAKER_33]: Then so be it, Mr. President.

2394
03:19:45,724 --> 03:19:54,166
[SPEAKER_33]: It is the height of hypocrisy, Mr. President, to stand there and say that someone would be in danger attending this meeting, Mr. President.

2395
03:19:55,106 --> 03:19:58,147
[SPEAKER_33]: Shame on whoever's spreading that around, Mr. President.

2396
03:19:58,427 --> 03:19:59,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Mr. President.

2397
03:19:59,048 --> 03:20:00,148
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Counselor Marks.

2398
03:20:00,788 --> 03:20:02,889
[SPEAKER_26]: Counselor Knight, and then Counselor Behrs.

2399
03:20:02,929 --> 03:20:03,529
[SPEAKER_26]: Counselor Knight.

2400
03:20:06,282 --> 03:20:07,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, I just want to say this.

2401
03:20:08,184 --> 03:20:11,187
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, we've been doing this Zoom thing now for what, since St.

2402
03:20:11,207 --> 03:20:11,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Patty's Day?

2403
03:20:12,368 --> 03:20:12,528
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes.

2404
03:20:12,588 --> 03:20:14,430
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so that's going back to March 16th.

2405
03:20:14,470 --> 03:20:15,911
[SPEAKER_04]: March 17th, we've been doing the Zoom.

2406
03:20:16,832 --> 03:20:17,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Almost six months.

2407
03:20:17,813 --> 03:20:19,094
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like Zoom at all.

2408
03:20:19,254 --> 03:20:19,895
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's awful.

2409
03:20:19,975 --> 03:20:21,396
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a terrible setup for it in my home.

2410
03:20:21,436 --> 03:20:22,237
[SPEAKER_04]: I got two young kids.

2411
03:20:22,317 --> 03:20:27,382
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't put them on lockdown for seven and eight and nine hour long meetings and tell them, don't say a word in the house, guys.

2412
03:20:27,462 --> 03:20:28,623
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a Zoom meeting going on.

2413
03:20:29,004 --> 03:20:29,944
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, it doesn't work for me.

2414
03:20:30,905 --> 03:20:33,428
[SPEAKER_04]: But I will say this, and I don't think anybody can shake a stick at it.

2415
03:20:33,488 --> 03:20:37,651
[SPEAKER_04]: The last two meetings that we've had in this chambers have been the best run meetings that we've had since St.

2416
03:20:37,671 --> 03:20:38,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Patrick's Day.

2417
03:20:39,093 --> 03:20:40,714
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll be happy to say that, Mr. President.

2418
03:20:40,734 --> 03:20:45,238
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason why is because we're in these chambers and we're doing business where business is supposed to be done.

2419
03:20:45,738 --> 03:20:51,704
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why when the governor issued his executive order, bodies public were exempt.

2420
03:20:55,387 --> 03:20:56,228
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

2421
03:21:00,414 --> 03:21:03,616
[SPEAKER_26]: So just to let everyone know, you know, before we, Councilor Pierce.

2422
03:21:04,557 --> 03:21:05,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2423
03:21:06,038 --> 03:21:08,980
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe when you walk in the building, it says you have to keep your mask on.

2424
03:21:09,320 --> 03:21:13,883
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, you know, if we're talking about following all rules and regulations, that's fine.

2425
03:21:14,023 --> 03:21:15,324
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not what this resolution says.

2426
03:21:15,524 --> 03:21:17,385
[SPEAKER_05]: It says, I'd like to check on that.

2427
03:21:17,865 --> 03:21:22,609
[SPEAKER_05]: It says that we should have not, not that the process that has gone through approval now,

2428
03:21:23,309 --> 03:21:31,671
[SPEAKER_05]: is at issue here, Counselor Marks, through the Chair, it's that if things change, do we need to make a different decision and how are we having the information to make that choice?

2429
03:21:31,751 --> 03:21:32,472
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what it's saying.

2430
03:21:32,832 --> 03:21:33,752
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be completely honest.

2431
03:21:33,772 --> 03:21:40,114
[SPEAKER_05]: The reason I proposed a B paper is because I've been wearing my mask this whole time and showing you the courtesy of doing that and I would like that to be returned to me.

2432
03:21:40,254 --> 03:21:42,995
[SPEAKER_05]: And if it's not, then I will attend in a way that makes me feel safe.

2433
03:21:43,955 --> 03:21:49,038
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, if my counselors don't want to do that, or they don't feel that wearing a mask is necessary, that's fine with them.

2434
03:21:49,218 --> 03:21:50,939
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to make a decision to make myself feel safe.

2435
03:21:51,240 --> 03:21:59,045
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that to Counselor Knight's point, to the integrity of the body, do we want President Falco trying to call on me on Zoom and call on you in here?

2436
03:21:59,085 --> 03:22:01,826
[SPEAKER_05]: It's already hard enough with the two of us in these back seats without a signal.

2437
03:22:01,906 --> 03:22:06,589
[SPEAKER_05]: So I ask for that reason, that everyone wear a mask, and I'll feel okay being in here.

2438
03:22:06,649 --> 03:22:09,992
[SPEAKER_05]: But to say that it's not everywhere we go, I don't go to restaurants.

2439
03:22:11,751 --> 03:22:14,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, then maybe we should meet on Zoom.

2440
03:22:15,093 --> 03:22:16,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Then maybe we should meet on Zoom.

2441
03:22:16,434 --> 03:22:18,015
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what to say, Council Marks.

2442
03:22:19,076 --> 03:22:19,876
[SPEAKER_05]: I can understand it.

2443
03:22:19,896 --> 03:22:21,157
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the public can understand it.

2444
03:22:24,125 --> 03:22:25,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2445
03:22:25,305 --> 03:22:31,828
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, I would ask that my colleagues respect the courtesy and the rules of the building and wear their masks.

2446
03:22:31,908 --> 03:22:33,889
[SPEAKER_05]: And if they don't, then we'll have to make the choices we make.

2447
03:22:33,969 --> 03:22:39,051
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guarantee you, it won't be as an effectively run meeting if some of the council are here and some of the council is not.

2448
03:22:39,091 --> 03:22:40,652
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why I proposed the B paper.

2449
03:22:40,852 --> 03:22:42,913
[SPEAKER_05]: And quite frankly, I'm disappointed.

2450
03:22:44,763 --> 03:22:47,004
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, thank you, Councilor Behrs.

2451
03:22:47,044 --> 03:22:48,024
[SPEAKER_07]: We have Councilor Morrell.

2452
03:22:48,784 --> 03:22:49,544
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2453
03:22:49,664 --> 03:22:53,665
[SPEAKER_07]: I continue to be dismayed by the health decisions trying to be made by other people.

2454
03:22:53,765 --> 03:22:59,747
[SPEAKER_07]: You do not know people's medical histories, their underlying conditions, their level of safety in being here.

2455
03:23:00,727 --> 03:23:06,689
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm just so dismayed by other people trying to make health decisions for people this entire time.

2456
03:23:10,813 --> 03:23:14,033
[SPEAKER_07]: I was only here for an hour until a fellow counselor asked that I be removed.

2457
03:23:14,893 --> 03:23:18,054
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been here for what, six and a half hours?

2458
03:23:21,635 --> 03:23:25,016
[SPEAKER_07]: Because there is no safe option.

2459
03:23:25,056 --> 03:23:28,816
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a safe option for these council meetings.

2460
03:23:29,196 --> 03:23:31,557
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a safe option for these council meetings.

2461
03:23:31,937 --> 03:23:33,599
[SPEAKER_07]: There's not a safe option.

2462
03:23:33,659 --> 03:23:35,941
[SPEAKER_07]: There's not another option for people to vote.

2463
03:23:36,461 --> 03:23:39,644
[SPEAKER_07]: And I stand by my decision to protect democracy.

2464
03:23:39,684 --> 03:23:40,225
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2465
03:23:40,305 --> 03:23:43,448
[SPEAKER_33]: And you also endorsed candidates that you were passing off ballots to.

2466
03:23:43,468 --> 03:23:45,610
[SPEAKER_33]: Point of information, Mr. President.

2467
03:23:45,630 --> 03:23:46,831
[SPEAKER_26]: That's enough, okay?

2468
03:23:46,891 --> 03:23:47,672
[SPEAKER_26]: That's enough.

2469
03:23:48,690 --> 03:23:49,191
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

2470
03:23:49,891 --> 03:23:50,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of information.

2471
03:23:51,733 --> 03:23:55,056
[SPEAKER_26]: We've debated this, I think everyone's had three times by now.

2472
03:23:55,196 --> 03:24:03,805
[SPEAKER_26]: What I want to say is this, and I'll be the final word on this, and that is that I have met with

2473
03:24:04,838 --> 03:24:12,181
[SPEAKER_26]: We've gone back and forth all over the phone with Marian O'Connor, with Kimberly Scanlon, and we're doing everything that we should be doing, okay?

2474
03:24:12,601 --> 03:24:14,701
[SPEAKER_26]: I have made sure of that, okay?

2475
03:24:15,202 --> 03:24:26,546
[SPEAKER_26]: So what I will be doing now, and I'll tell you this much, is I will be meeting with them again because maybe we'll have a committee in the hall about it.

2476
03:24:26,606 --> 03:24:27,506
[SPEAKER_26]: That's what we need to do.

2477
03:24:27,586 --> 03:24:29,947
[SPEAKER_26]: But I mean, I have gone.

2478
03:24:30,627 --> 03:24:43,553
[SPEAKER_26]: spent a ton of time going back and forth with each of the department heads, making sure that plexiglass goes up, making sure that everybody's seated in the right spot, working with Patrick Gordon to do all the technology piece.

2479
03:24:44,014 --> 03:24:45,454
[SPEAKER_26]: This has not been an easy task, but

2480
03:24:46,855 --> 03:24:51,797
[SPEAKER_26]: If I go back at the past meetings, everybody was pretty much on board with getting back in chambers.

2481
03:24:52,777 --> 03:24:58,420
[SPEAKER_26]: So what we have been doing is we've basically been following the rules that have been put in place.

2482
03:24:58,980 --> 03:25:04,962
[SPEAKER_26]: So with that being said, to get us all on the same page, we can meet with our department heads again.

2483
03:25:06,023 --> 03:25:11,705
[SPEAKER_26]: But to tell you the truth, there are some cities and towns that are meeting, actually, and having the public here as well.

2484
03:25:12,666 --> 03:25:15,647
[SPEAKER_26]: Now, I've been told by our city solicitor that we can't do that.

2485
03:25:17,498 --> 03:25:18,562
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, the room.

2486
03:25:20,990 --> 03:25:23,071
[SPEAKER_26]: I do have that, and I can send that to you.

2487
03:25:23,652 --> 03:25:28,635
[SPEAKER_26]: But with that being said, the opinion was that the room's got 25 people in it.

2488
03:25:29,276 --> 03:25:32,378
[SPEAKER_26]: If 30 people show up to the meeting, we can't kick people out of the room.

2489
03:25:32,798 --> 03:25:37,661
[SPEAKER_26]: And therefore, we would be limiting speech and be limiting participation.

2490
03:25:37,961 --> 03:25:39,943
[SPEAKER_26]: So it would be a violation of the open meeting law.

2491
03:25:40,323 --> 03:25:43,565
[SPEAKER_26]: And that's why we're here tonight, and the public is coming in through Zoom.

2492
03:25:44,446 --> 03:25:47,428
[SPEAKER_26]: That is the reason I got from the city solicitor.

2493
03:25:48,148 --> 03:25:52,252
[SPEAKER_26]: So with that being said, that's where we are with that, okay?

2494
03:25:52,992 --> 03:25:55,014
[SPEAKER_26]: So we have a number of people that want to ask questions on this.

2495
03:25:55,875 --> 03:25:56,896
[SPEAKER_26]: I will call on that now.

2496
03:25:56,916 --> 03:26:00,039
[SPEAKER_26]: William Navar, name and address for the record, please.

2497
03:26:00,419 --> 03:26:01,280
[SPEAKER_26]: You have a minute and a half.

2498
03:26:02,541 --> 03:26:03,862
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, President Falco.

2499
03:26:04,302 --> 03:26:07,385
[SPEAKER_12]: William Navar, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

2500
03:26:08,940 --> 03:26:12,964
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm quite disappointed with the vitriol on both sides of this issue.

2501
03:26:13,384 --> 03:26:16,727
[SPEAKER_12]: And I wish we could take a problem-solving stance.

2502
03:26:17,447 --> 03:26:22,072
[SPEAKER_12]: And I've seen different city councils do this in different ways, et cetera.

2503
03:26:22,372 --> 03:26:24,193
[SPEAKER_12]: But just as a matter of practicality,

2504
03:26:25,474 --> 03:26:30,295
[SPEAKER_12]: I think there's probably a way to meet safely and perhaps a safe mess or not, I'm not sure.

2505
03:26:30,816 --> 03:26:34,917
[SPEAKER_12]: But just as I see on my screen, you can't actually see the counselors.

2506
03:26:34,957 --> 03:26:37,077
[SPEAKER_12]: I can see you, President Falcone.

2507
03:26:37,097 --> 03:26:45,460
[SPEAKER_12]: I can see Claire Curnaby, but the other counselors I can't actually see, which is actually sort of worse than when everybody's at home.

2508
03:26:46,280 --> 03:26:52,742
[SPEAKER_12]: And also nobody's in the chamber, so it doesn't really provide access for people who can't do Zoom.

2509
03:26:54,783 --> 03:27:04,269
[SPEAKER_12]: But mostly, I just hope we can get back into a problem-solving, problem-solving kind of thing, rather than this material is pretty frustrating to me.

2510
03:27:04,569 --> 03:27:05,770
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2511
03:27:06,891 --> 03:27:07,331
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

2512
03:27:07,371 --> 03:27:09,152
[SPEAKER_26]: We'll see.

2513
03:27:09,192 --> 03:27:10,894
[SPEAKER_26]: We have Jean Nuzzo.

2514
03:27:10,914 --> 03:27:12,174
[SPEAKER_26]: Name and address for the record, please.

2515
03:27:13,155 --> 03:27:13,275
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi.

2516
03:27:13,335 --> 03:27:13,735
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2517
03:27:13,776 --> 03:27:15,397
[SPEAKER_14]: Jean Nuzzo, 35 Paris Street.

2518
03:27:15,557 --> 03:27:16,177
[SPEAKER_26]: Give a minute and a half.

2519
03:27:16,197 --> 03:27:17,378
[SPEAKER_14]: Just a few quick thoughts.

2520
03:27:17,518 --> 03:27:21,080
[SPEAKER_14]: First of all, you're in a space with 20-foot ceilings.

2521
03:27:21,421 --> 03:27:22,802
[SPEAKER_14]: You're distance beyond 10 feet.

2522
03:27:23,763 --> 03:27:31,265
[SPEAKER_14]: and a room that typically holds between 200 and 250 people, you're currently at between two and two and a half percent capacity.

2523
03:27:31,886 --> 03:27:35,527
[SPEAKER_14]: As for public participation, City Hall is quite large.

2524
03:27:36,047 --> 03:27:47,931
[SPEAKER_14]: You could do an inbound pathway and an outbound pathway with some staged areas, six foot distancing dots and monitors in the hallway, and citizens and residents of Medford

2525
03:27:48,792 --> 03:27:50,173
[SPEAKER_14]: and speak in front of that chamber.

2526
03:27:50,473 --> 03:27:51,974
[SPEAKER_14]: And if you need some help, let me know.

2527
03:27:52,274 --> 03:27:55,076
[SPEAKER_14]: I've done a million square feet of this at this point.

2528
03:27:55,477 --> 03:27:58,979
[SPEAKER_14]: So again, I applaud you being on site.

2529
03:27:59,520 --> 03:28:08,046
[SPEAKER_14]: I recognize that people are concerned about masks, but right now in this moment, you're roughly at 2% occupancy, which is lower than what's required.

2530
03:28:08,627 --> 03:28:09,767
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for letting me speak.

2531
03:28:09,928 --> 03:28:11,909
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, if you need my help, let me know.

2532
03:28:12,149 --> 03:28:12,850
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

2533
03:28:12,870 --> 03:28:16,633
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, up next we have Joanna.

2534
03:28:17,655 --> 03:28:23,978
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm sorry if I'm saying that wrong.

2535
03:28:24,758 --> 03:28:26,359
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, name and address for the record, please.

2536
03:28:26,919 --> 03:28:29,900
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you have a minute?

2537
03:28:29,960 --> 03:28:36,803
[SPEAKER_08]: I just think that yeah, I whatever you whatever the decisions were made to me in chambers is one thing.

2538
03:28:37,403 --> 03:28:45,606
[SPEAKER_08]: But during a global pandemic, you can't tell anybody individually what they shouldn't, should not do or what they're comfortable with.

2539
03:28:47,706 --> 03:28:54,872
[SPEAKER_08]: As far as the other counselors, yelling and screaming at other counselors, it's so ridiculous.

2540
03:28:54,952 --> 03:29:01,657
[SPEAKER_08]: And President Falco, it's not your fault, but I would take better control of that room, because it wouldn't be happening, not on my watch.

2541
03:29:02,298 --> 03:29:02,938
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not right.

2542
03:29:03,198 --> 03:29:04,560
[SPEAKER_08]: They shouldn't be doing it to each other.

2543
03:29:05,640 --> 03:29:06,041
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2544
03:29:06,181 --> 03:29:06,641
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

2545
03:29:11,245 --> 03:29:13,587
[SPEAKER_26]: Rick Caparo, name and address for the record, please.

2546
03:29:16,103 --> 03:29:34,649
[SPEAKER_19]: I would just like to let Councilor Morrell and Councilor Bares, if they're so concerned about everyone's health and everyone in the council in the room, then they would be very concerned about the children they plan on having at a rally on Saturday.

2547
03:29:35,449 --> 03:29:38,490
[SPEAKER_19]: So they should stop being hypocrites and respect the city.

2548
03:29:38,850 --> 03:29:39,210
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

2549
03:29:39,690 --> 03:29:39,990
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

2550
03:29:40,070 --> 03:29:41,391
[SPEAKER_26]: Point of information, Councilor Morrell.

2551
03:29:41,451 --> 03:29:41,831
[SPEAKER_26]: One second.

2552
03:29:41,851 --> 03:29:44,352
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Morrell, one second.

2553
03:29:46,419 --> 03:29:48,341
[SPEAKER_26]: Put your microphone on.

2554
03:29:48,381 --> 03:29:50,764
[SPEAKER_07]: Through the chair, I'm not having a rally on Saturday.

2555
03:29:50,784 --> 03:29:51,785
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to make that clear.

2556
03:29:51,865 --> 03:29:52,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2557
03:29:52,505 --> 03:29:53,747
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

2558
03:29:54,387 --> 03:29:56,209
[SPEAKER_26]: Let's see, we have Laurel Rummel.

2559
03:29:56,269 --> 03:29:58,832
[SPEAKER_26]: Laurel, name and address of the record, Laurel.

2560
03:29:58,972 --> 03:29:59,412
[SPEAKER_26]: Oops, sorry.

2561
03:30:01,674 --> 03:30:02,315
[SPEAKER_26]: Trying to unmute you.

2562
03:30:02,655 --> 03:30:05,458
[SPEAKER_16]: Laurel Rummel, 149 Burgett Avenue.

2563
03:30:07,428 --> 03:30:19,335
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's very disrespectful the way that everyone is acting, and I think you all know better, and to have counselors shout over each other and call each other names is outrageous.

2564
03:30:20,616 --> 03:30:22,417
[SPEAKER_16]: You're there as all representatives.

2565
03:30:22,437 --> 03:30:28,741
[SPEAKER_16]: I understand this is a heated debate, but everyone has to do the best practices possible to keep everyone else safe.

2566
03:30:30,141 --> 03:30:34,224
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just very disappointing and ridiculous that we've come to this.

2567
03:30:35,227 --> 03:30:37,489
[SPEAKER_16]: Two, the Zoom meetings are fantastic.

2568
03:30:37,789 --> 03:30:39,231
[SPEAKER_16]: More than 100 people are online.

2569
03:30:39,251 --> 03:30:42,734
[SPEAKER_16]: Probably 10 people are watching through the feed.

2570
03:30:43,114 --> 03:30:51,001
[SPEAKER_16]: We need to kind of keep this participation and interest and people just being exposed to how the city does business going.

2571
03:30:51,441 --> 03:30:57,387
[SPEAKER_16]: And I have to tell you, you've got to be more welcoming than shouting and arguing this constantly.

2572
03:30:58,302 --> 03:31:03,004
[SPEAKER_16]: Lastly, I'm not sure what the devil in the room is with the social media and the negativity.

2573
03:31:03,945 --> 03:31:12,409
[SPEAKER_16]: All I'm seeing on social media is a lot of people trying to figure out how to make Medford the best place it can be for as many people as possible.

2574
03:31:13,010 --> 03:31:16,752
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, everyone is quite heated right now.

2575
03:31:17,092 --> 03:31:21,554
[SPEAKER_16]: But let's just kind of step back a minute and take a breath.

2576
03:31:22,475 --> 03:31:26,316
[SPEAKER_16]: And I really appreciate that we're not calling each other hypocrites.

2577
03:31:26,937 --> 03:31:27,177
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2578
03:31:28,158 --> 03:31:28,458
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

2579
03:31:30,960 --> 03:31:32,621
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, I believe that is everyone.

2580
03:31:33,622 --> 03:31:42,167
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, so on the B paper offered by Councilor Beers, on that B paper, that was seconded by, does that have a second, Councilor Morrell?

2581
03:31:43,048 --> 03:31:46,650
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, on the B paper.

2582
03:31:46,970 --> 03:31:49,092
[SPEAKER_26]: Clerk, could you please read the B paper back?

2583
03:31:51,293 --> 03:31:53,755
[SPEAKER_22]: I believe the B paper was to have the Council President

2584
03:31:55,393 --> 03:31:58,334
[SPEAKER_22]: Mandate masks behind the rail during council meetings.

2585
03:31:58,555 --> 03:31:59,735
[SPEAKER_22]: Is that correct council bears?

2586
03:31:59,855 --> 03:32:00,135
[SPEAKER_18]: Correct.

2587
03:32:00,175 --> 03:32:23,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Clark That is correct amend the paper to amend the council rules to mandate masks behind the rail

2588
03:32:24,270 --> 03:32:27,111
[SPEAKER_05]: for the duration of the COVID-19 state of emergency.

2589
03:32:27,131 --> 03:32:29,132
[SPEAKER_22]: We want to amend the paper.

2590
03:32:33,193 --> 03:32:35,073
[SPEAKER_22]: Amend the council rules.

2591
03:32:35,093 --> 03:32:37,814
[SPEAKER_26]: Do you have the language on that paper?

2592
03:32:37,834 --> 03:32:38,194
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm trying.

2593
03:32:57,447 --> 03:32:58,407
[SPEAKER_22]: All right, let me read this back.

2594
03:32:58,828 --> 03:33:09,151
[SPEAKER_22]: So the B paper is to amend the council rules to mandate masks behind the rail during council meetings for the duration of the COVID-19 emergency.

2595
03:33:09,611 --> 03:33:11,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, as issued by Governor Baker.

2596
03:33:13,033 --> 03:33:13,773
[SPEAKER_25]: What was the last part?

2597
03:33:14,193 --> 03:33:17,694
[SPEAKER_05]: The COVID-19 state of emergency as issued by Governor Baker.

2598
03:33:17,714 --> 03:33:19,115
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

2599
03:33:19,135 --> 03:33:19,915
[SPEAKER_26]: Did I clear everybody?

2600
03:33:20,855 --> 03:33:21,096
[SPEAKER_26]: Got it.

2601
03:33:28,358 --> 03:33:38,743
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Beers made a motion and Councilor Knight has asked that that be moved to the Rules Subcommittee, where that can be discussed.

2602
03:33:39,524 --> 03:33:42,666
[SPEAKER_26]: Because to be honest with you, Councilor Beers, I don't even know if I have the authority to do that.

2603
03:33:42,706 --> 03:33:44,046
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, I can't tell.

2604
03:33:44,066 --> 03:33:47,788
[SPEAKER_26]: So I think it probably needs to be discussed.

2605
03:33:48,669 --> 03:33:56,593
[SPEAKER_26]: So on a motion of Councilor Knight to move that to the Rules Subcommittee, was there a second there?

2606
03:33:58,217 --> 03:33:59,577
[SPEAKER_26]: Seconded by Councilor Scott Kelly.

2607
03:33:59,597 --> 03:34:00,918
[SPEAKER_26]: Clerk Urtubis, please call the roll.

2608
03:34:01,978 --> 03:34:03,498
[SPEAKER_26]: This is to move it to the Rules Subcommittee?

2609
03:34:03,658 --> 03:34:03,899
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

2610
03:34:06,779 --> 03:34:07,440
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Behrs?

2611
03:34:07,780 --> 03:34:08,060
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

2612
03:34:10,020 --> 03:34:10,960
[SPEAKER_22]: Vice President Caraballo?

2613
03:34:11,221 --> 03:34:11,441
Yes.

2614
03:34:15,782 --> 03:34:16,582
[SPEAKER_22]: Vice President Caraballo?

2615
03:34:17,282 --> 03:34:17,442
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

2616
03:34:17,502 --> 03:34:18,162
[SPEAKER_26]: That was a yes.

2617
03:34:18,983 --> 03:34:19,083
[SPEAKER_22]: OK.

2618
03:34:19,523 --> 03:34:20,043
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Night?

2619
03:34:20,303 --> 03:34:20,523
No.

2620
03:34:24,684 --> 03:34:25,745
[SPEAKER_22]: I can't hear Councilor Night either.

2621
03:34:26,285 --> 03:34:26,665
[SPEAKER_26]: No.

2622
03:34:26,685 --> 03:34:27,285
[SPEAKER_26]: He said no.

2623
03:34:29,858 --> 03:34:30,539
[SPEAKER_22]: And that's a no.

2624
03:34:31,720 --> 03:34:32,000
[SPEAKER_26]: Correct.

2625
03:34:56,098 --> 03:34:58,699
[SPEAKER_26]: Four in the affirmative, three in the negative.

2626
03:34:59,679 --> 03:35:02,240
[SPEAKER_26]: The B paper has been moved to the Rules Subcommittee.

2627
03:35:05,141 --> 03:35:10,803
[SPEAKER_26]: On the main motion offered by Councilor Behrs, and that was seconded by, was there a second on that?

2628
03:35:11,143 --> 03:35:11,423
[SPEAKER_26]: Second.

2629
03:35:12,723 --> 03:35:13,783
[SPEAKER_26]: Seconded by Councilor Morrell.

2630

[SPEAKER_22]: Vice President Caraballo.

2636
03:35:32,717 --> 03:35:32,857
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

2637
03:35:32,977 --> 03:35:33,257

[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, 4 in the affirmative, 3 in the negative, the motion passes.

2647
03:36:08,227 --> 03:36:08,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2648
03:36:08,447 --> 03:36:09,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, when do you plan on meeting with the Board of Health?

2649
03:36:13,131 --> 03:36:14,412
[SPEAKER_26]: We'll see, I've got to find time.

2650
03:36:15,713 --> 03:36:16,333
[SPEAKER_26]: We'll figure it out.

2651
03:36:16,433 --> 03:36:21,977
[SPEAKER_26]: I have to meet with Mary Ann and Kim Scanlon sooner than later.

2652
03:36:21,997 --> 03:36:22,878
[SPEAKER_26]: I talked to them today.

2653
03:36:22,898 --> 03:36:25,659
[SPEAKER_26]: We will be setting up some time and we can

2654
03:36:27,609 --> 03:36:29,370
[SPEAKER_26]: work on that issue as well, so.

2655
03:36:30,690 --> 03:36:36,712
[SPEAKER_04]: So you'd be meeting with just the Board of Health and the solicitor yourself behind closed doors and then coming up with a plan?

2656
03:36:36,973 --> 03:36:43,775
[SPEAKER_26]: No, I just talked to them today and I told them I wanted to speak to them more about what we're doing here and how we're doing it.

2657
03:36:43,815 --> 03:36:45,916
[SPEAKER_26]: Just want to make sure everybody's on the same page.

2658
03:36:45,996 --> 03:36:51,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Because where it's, as a result of a council resolution, you might want to be careful meeting behind closed doors.

2659
03:36:51,558 --> 03:36:54,619
[SPEAKER_26]: Absolutely, so that's fine, we can do that.

2660
03:36:54,859 --> 03:36:55,159
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

2661
03:36:56,378 --> 03:37:10,144
[SPEAKER_26]: 20-537 offered by Council of Mayors, whereas residents of Meffitt requested that the city of Meffitt hang a banner stating Black Lives Matter at Meffitt City Hall as a statement of solidarity and support to begin to address the history of racism and discrimination in our community.

2662
03:37:10,305 --> 03:37:17,288
[SPEAKER_26]: And whereas the Supreme Court of the United States and Rosenberger versus Rectors and Visitors of University of Virginia established

2663
03:37:17,848 --> 03:37:25,313
[SPEAKER_26]: The government speech doctrine recognizing that a government entity is entitled to say what it wishes and select views it wants to express.

2664
03:37:25,573 --> 03:37:35,379
[SPEAKER_26]: And whereas the government speech doctrine has been affirmed and reinforced by Supreme Court decisions including but not limited to Russ versus Sullivan, Johans versus Livestock.

2665
03:37:36,393 --> 03:37:56,005
[SPEAKER_26]: Marketing Association, Pleasant Grove City v. Summum, Walker v. Texas Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans and Matal v. TAM, and whereas placing a banner on Memphis City Hall meets the multi-factor test defined in Summum and Walker of, number one, historic use of building

2666
03:37:56,825 --> 03:38:16,169
[SPEAKER_26]: including banners to convey government messages, two, the public's close identification of messages and signage placed on Medford City Hall with the city government, and three, the city of Medford's maintenance of effective control over the messages conveyed, and whereas in 2018 the U.S.

2667
03:38:16,189 --> 03:38:22,110
[SPEAKER_26]: District Court for the District of Massachusetts in Shirtland versus the City of Boston denied the request for injunction

2668
03:38:22,570 --> 03:38:32,177
[SPEAKER_26]: of a plaintiff requesting the flying of a specific flag on Boston City Hall using the government speech doctrine and multi-factor test defined in Summum and Walker.

2669
03:38:32,438 --> 03:38:35,200
[SPEAKER_26]: And whereas in 2019, the U.S.

2670
03:38:35,960 --> 03:38:47,729
[SPEAKER_26]: Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed the decision of District Court of Shurtleff with a three-judge panel deciding unanimously to reject the plaintiff's appeal.

2671
03:38:47,829 --> 03:38:48,610
[SPEAKER_26]: Now, therefore,

2672
03:38:50,333 --> 03:39:02,878
[SPEAKER_26]: Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council, that the city administration provide a summary explanation of the opinion regarding banners on Memphis City Hall and how it is possible that such an opinion can ignore the U.S.

2673
03:39:02,938 --> 03:39:10,501
[SPEAKER_26]: Constitution's government speech doctrine as decided and affirmed by decades of precedent of the Supreme Court of the United States.

2674
03:39:13,002 --> 03:39:13,723
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Beers.

2675
03:39:16,253 --> 03:39:19,758
[SPEAKER_26]: So this same resolution has been offered two weeks in a row.

2676
03:39:20,599 --> 03:39:25,586
[SPEAKER_26]: So when the council rules, I have to rule this out of order because it has been two weeks in a row.

2677
03:39:25,606 --> 03:39:29,412
[SPEAKER_26]: This is verbatim, the same exact resolution as a prior meeting.

2678
03:39:30,482 --> 03:39:37,865
[SPEAKER_26]: Now, so with that being said, the matter basically has already been disposed of because I was ruled out of order in the previous week.

2679
03:39:38,846 --> 03:39:40,386
[SPEAKER_26]: There was a doubting of the chair.

2680
03:39:41,287 --> 03:39:48,090
[SPEAKER_26]: But with that being said, what I did do today is I made a phone call to Chief of Staff Rodriguez.

2681
03:39:49,776 --> 03:39:56,621
[SPEAKER_26]: And he was busy all day meeting, so I did have a conversation with the mayor regarding this very issue.

2682
03:39:57,181 --> 03:40:06,308
[SPEAKER_26]: So what I wanted to let you know is during our conversation, what she said is the response is on the way, and that the council should receive it within the next few days.

2683
03:40:07,506 --> 03:40:13,308
[SPEAKER_26]: She also went out to say that the administration is also working on a policy with regard to banners.

2684
03:40:13,508 --> 03:40:16,409
[SPEAKER_26]: There's no timeline on that, but there is a policy that they are working on.

2685
03:40:16,889 --> 03:40:20,950
[SPEAKER_26]: But she said that we will be getting a response, because we haven't received an official response.

2686
03:40:21,390 --> 03:40:24,791
[SPEAKER_26]: But we will be getting that in the next few days, okay?

2687
03:40:25,071 --> 03:40:25,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2688
03:40:26,072 --> 03:40:26,492
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

2689
03:40:26,512 --> 03:40:36,355
[SPEAKER_26]: 20-53, an offer by Councilor- Can I ask why it's taking a month?

2690
03:40:38,694 --> 03:40:42,178
[SPEAKER_23]: What's coronavirus?

2691
03:40:42,238 --> 03:40:43,719
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, the paper's out of order.

2692
03:40:44,480 --> 03:40:45,141
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

2693
03:40:45,221 --> 03:40:46,242
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, the paper's out of order.

2694
03:40:46,302 --> 03:40:56,052
[SPEAKER_26]: I do not know why the administration's taking as long as it's taking, but that is what I was told and I wanted to pass that information on to my colleagues.

2695
03:40:56,452 --> 03:40:57,533
[SPEAKER_23]: I think a month is

2696
03:40:59,403 --> 03:41:01,884
[SPEAKER_26]: I would agree, but you know.

2697
03:41:01,904 --> 03:41:19,632
[SPEAKER_26]: 20-53, an offer by Councilor Morrell, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council request that a representative from the administration provide an update on COVID-19 metrics for Memphis in any policy changes related to the pandemic at each forthcoming regular City Council meeting so long as deemed necessary to city operations.

2698
03:41:20,172 --> 03:41:20,753
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Morrell?

2699
03:41:22,434 --> 03:41:23,094
[SPEAKER_26]: Give me one second.

2700
03:41:27,156 --> 03:41:28,117
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Morrell.

2701
03:41:28,177 --> 03:41:28,877
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2702
03:41:28,897 --> 03:41:30,639
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, this is pretty self-explanatory.

2703
03:41:30,899 --> 03:41:32,660
[SPEAKER_07]: I've had a few residents reach out about this.

2704
03:41:32,700 --> 03:41:33,661
[SPEAKER_07]: I know we have the dashboard.

2705
03:41:33,681 --> 03:41:52,815
[SPEAKER_07]: The dashboard is beautiful, but it does seem like there's a real opportunity at City Council meetings to hear from the administration, just a brief update about perhaps any changes, any different metrics, or how things are impacting things because I know we have, you know, it's seemingly every day that state unveils some new color map and what it means and, you know, the goalposts keep on moving.

2706
03:41:53,655 --> 03:42:02,099
[SPEAKER_07]: and changing so I think it would just be an opportune thing to have a representative from the administration just explain kind of where we are and any necessary updates.

2707
03:42:02,259 --> 03:42:03,780
[SPEAKER_07]: So I move approval.

2708
03:42:04,460 --> 03:42:04,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2709
03:42:05,520 --> 03:42:05,840
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

2710
03:42:06,181 --> 03:42:07,661
[SPEAKER_26]: On the motion of Councilor Morrell.

2711
03:42:09,542 --> 03:42:13,224
[SPEAKER_26]: On the motion of Councilor Morrell, seconded by Councilor Beers, Councilor Knight.

2712
03:42:14,124 --> 03:42:20,607
[SPEAKER_04]: From an operational standpoint, through you, through the author of the amendment, so does this feel like a standing

2713
03:42:21,918 --> 03:42:25,920
[SPEAKER_04]: COVID-19 updated every single council meeting by someone from the administration?

2714
03:42:26,080 --> 03:42:30,642
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm just concerned about posting, you know, I mean, we've talked about suspension of the rules.

2715
03:42:30,682 --> 03:42:33,062
[SPEAKER_04]: We've talked about how we're not bringing items under suspension of the rules.

2716
03:42:33,863 --> 03:42:36,064
[SPEAKER_04]: We have posting requirements through the open meeting law.

2717
03:42:36,164 --> 03:42:38,004
[SPEAKER_04]: So would this be like a standing invitation?

2718
03:42:38,024 --> 03:42:40,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it the first meeting of every month?

2719
03:42:40,205 --> 03:42:49,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it whenever the administration feels fit or is this gonna be one of those things where every month we say, okay, is anybody here from the administration that wants to come and give us an update on Corona?

2720
03:42:50,149 --> 03:42:51,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, no, all right, moving on.

2721
03:42:53,120 --> 03:42:55,281
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, I have the same question procedurally.

2722
03:42:56,282 --> 03:43:04,107
[SPEAKER_07]: My intention was just to get a response from the administration first and then understand how it might be introduced by them if it's something they're willing to do.

2723
03:43:04,127 --> 03:43:07,950
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand it's, yeah, procedurally it's something strange, but it's strange times.

2724
03:43:11,052 --> 03:43:12,413
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, point of information.

2725
03:43:13,229 --> 03:43:14,549
[SPEAKER_26]: Point of information, council appears.

2726
03:43:14,989 --> 03:43:20,430
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it could be a weekly communication from the mayor that ends up on the agenda, something like that.

2727
03:43:20,450 --> 03:43:22,891
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm interested to hear what the administration has to say.

2728
03:43:25,691 --> 03:43:26,211
[SPEAKER_26]: It could be that.

2729
03:43:26,251 --> 03:43:26,972
[SPEAKER_26]: That says one or two.

2730
03:43:27,012 --> 03:43:29,172
[SPEAKER_26]: Like, could it be like a report for marrying an honor?

2731
03:43:29,272 --> 03:43:29,392
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2732
03:43:29,412 --> 03:43:29,572
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2733
03:43:29,692 --> 03:43:30,092
[SPEAKER_07]: That's, yeah.

2734
03:43:30,152 --> 03:43:30,812
[SPEAKER_07]: I would ideally, yeah.

2735
03:43:31,672 --> 03:43:37,253
[SPEAKER_07]: Putting this to the administration, seeing how they would like to deliver it via communications from the mayor, communications from the administration.

2736
03:43:37,273 --> 03:43:40,274
[SPEAKER_07]: That could be added if they see fit, if it's something they agree to.

2737
03:43:41,946 --> 03:43:45,287
[SPEAKER_04]: So it wouldn't be that they're necessarily appearing before the council and are on the agenda.

2738
03:43:45,307 --> 03:43:47,728
[SPEAKER_04]: The request would be that they give us a weekly report as to the status.

2739
03:43:49,869 --> 03:43:55,412
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, my intention would be to have someone to actually speak from the administration because there is stuff online.

2740
03:43:55,432 --> 03:44:02,915
[SPEAKER_07]: There is stuff already in report form and this would just be kind of anything that's worth addressing that week, that needs to be addressed that week.

2741
03:44:04,095 --> 03:44:06,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Under council purview or just in general?

2742
03:44:08,416 --> 03:44:24,945
[SPEAKER_07]: I see it in general as this being, you know, we have X number of people on the call right now, it just being that these are well attended and as opposed to having to hunt stuff down on the website and try to parse out data, just getting an update to say, okay, here's the numbers and here's how it impacts anything, or maybe it doesn't, or maybe there's not an update that week.

2743
03:44:26,026 --> 03:44:34,130
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it's not possible procedurally, but I think it is, it's information that's being asked for in the community and it's, this is a vehicle to provide it.

2744
03:44:39,645 --> 03:44:40,406
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Caviello.

2745
03:44:40,826 --> 03:44:41,847
[SPEAKER_26]: Vice President Caviello.

2746
03:44:42,668 --> 03:44:54,220
[SPEAKER_23]: Councilor, I didn't, I couldn't understand what you were saying because I am hearing impaired and I just, if you could repeat what you started with, I just, I just couldn't, I couldn't understand what you said.

2747
03:44:55,781 --> 03:45:06,667
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just hoping because we do have the dashboard and there are numbers there, but sometimes it's a certain amount of parsing out and trying to understand, you know, looking at one screen and seeing what the state metrics say and how we're supposed to behave based on those numbers.

2748
03:45:06,867 --> 03:45:13,010
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we could get an update directly from the administration as far as our metrics and if it's changing any policies that week.

2749
03:45:13,951 --> 03:45:18,574
[SPEAKER_07]: But I do understand it's procedurally as far as being introduced as an agenda item, it's a little bit tricky.

2750
03:45:18,594 --> 03:45:23,897
[SPEAKER_07]: So my intention is just to deliver this to administration and get a response from them as far as how they might

2751
03:45:24,897 --> 03:45:31,843
[SPEAKER_07]: if they would be interested in delivering such a thing and how they might want to deliver it, whether it's communications from the mayor or something like that.

2752
03:45:31,863 --> 03:45:38,248
[SPEAKER_07]: But I do think there is a benefit to having a representative from the administration when possible to briefly address this.

2753
03:45:39,769 --> 03:45:42,431
[SPEAKER_23]: So this would be on a weekly basis or a monthly basis?

2754
03:45:43,572 --> 03:45:52,079
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, weekly would be nice, but I think I also, I'd be happy to amend the paper to have the administration at a frequency they deem necessary.

2755
03:45:58,357 --> 03:45:58,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2756
03:46:00,377 --> 03:46:01,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that an amendment?

2757
03:46:01,898 --> 03:46:03,478
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2758
03:46:04,118 --> 03:46:08,399
[SPEAKER_07]: If we could add the language at a frequency that the administration deems necessary in the form of an amendment.

2759
03:46:09,459 --> 03:46:13,180
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to strike the language at each forthcoming regular council meeting?

2760
03:46:13,420 --> 03:46:13,620
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2761
03:46:13,860 --> 03:46:14,780
[SPEAKER_07]: You can strike that language.

2762
03:46:14,880 --> 03:46:15,700
[SPEAKER_07]: We can strike that language.

2763
03:46:15,740 --> 03:46:19,861
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll second that amendment, Mr. President.

2764
03:46:19,881 --> 03:46:20,981
[SPEAKER_26]: Any other questions for the council?

2765
03:46:23,761 --> 03:46:24,462
[SPEAKER_26]: Any other questions?

2766
03:46:25,842 --> 03:46:26,322

2803
03:49:08,028 --> 03:49:13,611
[SPEAKER_26]: On the motion, I'm counseling tonight to refer to Committee of the Whole for a presentation from the owner of the property.

2804
03:49:13,791 --> 03:49:14,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that OK?

2805
03:49:14,932 --> 03:49:15,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

2806
03:49:15,212 --> 03:49:19,915
[SPEAKER_04]: From the Historic District Commission, I think, would be the ones that are imposing this, presenting this.

2807
03:49:19,935 --> 03:49:21,736
[SPEAKER_04]: So the Historic District Commission can present it.

2808
03:49:21,756 --> 03:49:26,139
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have the owner of the property there, as well as a representative from the mayor's office, Mr. President.

2809
03:49:26,479 --> 03:49:29,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Today, I had the opportunity to speak with Mayor Lungo on a number of issues.

2810
03:49:29,741 --> 03:49:30,902
[SPEAKER_04]: And this topic came up.

2811
03:49:31,402 --> 03:49:36,225
[SPEAKER_04]: And she suggested that we meet in the Committee of the Whole, and she'll have a representative from her staff available.

2812
03:49:36,966 --> 03:49:42,472
[SPEAKER_04]: To sit down with us and go over the paper as well as representatives from the Historic District Commission there, okay?

2815
03:49:54,452 --> 03:49:57,894
[SPEAKER_26]: So the motion was to refer to committee, the whole seconded by Councilor Scott, followed by Councilor Morrell.

2816
03:49:58,234 --> 03:49:58,834
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2817
03:49:58,854 --> 03:50:03,616
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm curious if we could amend that to add to a date certain, because this demo delay expires in October.

2818
03:50:03,716 --> 03:50:08,218
[SPEAKER_07]: So we would probably want to meet before the expiration to actually have this conversation.

2819
03:50:08,238 --> 03:50:10,159
[SPEAKER_07]: So make sure we do that in due time.

2820
03:50:10,179 --> 03:50:15,302
[SPEAKER_04]: And on to that point, Mr. President, I spoke with the mayor and she said that she would make someone available next week.

2821
03:50:15,442 --> 03:50:17,623
[SPEAKER_04]: She said she'd be willing to do that, but it would have to happen next week.

2822
03:50:17,983 --> 03:50:19,824
[SPEAKER_26]: If I may, we actually do have

2823
03:50:22,027 --> 03:50:24,007
[SPEAKER_26]: You can blow up my meeting.

2824
03:50:24,027 --> 03:50:25,428
[SPEAKER_07]: You're taking it Wednesday, right?

2825
03:50:25,508 --> 03:50:25,808
[SPEAKER_07]: It's OK.

2826
03:50:25,908 --> 03:50:26,548
[SPEAKER_26]: I understand.

2827
03:50:26,568 --> 03:50:27,608
[SPEAKER_26]: This is timely.

2828
03:50:27,628 --> 03:50:29,808
[SPEAKER_26]: So it'll be either Tuesday or Wednesday next week, OK?

2829
03:50:31,309 --> 03:50:32,769
[SPEAKER_26]: Just to let everyone know.

2830
03:50:33,629 --> 03:50:34,969
[SPEAKER_26]: So we'll get it scheduled sooner than later.

2831
03:50:34,989 --> 03:50:38,410
[SPEAKER_26]: OK, so Councilor Morrell has amended the paper.

2832
03:50:38,750 --> 03:50:39,450
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Beers?

2833
03:50:40,010 --> 03:50:41,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that was the same thing.

2834
03:50:41,130 --> 03:50:43,531
[SPEAKER_05]: So if it's happening next week, I'm fine with that.

2835
03:50:44,571 --> 03:50:45,851
[SPEAKER_26]: OK, thank you, Councilor Beers.

2836
03:50:46,991 --> 03:50:48,572
[SPEAKER_26]: Any other questions or comments from the council?

2837
03:50:49,252 --> 03:50:49,752
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. President?

2838
03:50:51,338 --> 03:51:00,005
[SPEAKER_22]: Quick question, so Councilor Morrell is offering an amendment to a date certain, is that correct?

2839
03:51:01,046 --> 03:51:08,653
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, I think, I don't formally have a date yet, so I'm aiming for next Tuesday or Wednesday.

2840
03:51:09,694 --> 03:51:10,494
[SPEAKER_04]: No less than 10 days.

2841
03:51:12,996 --> 03:51:16,620
[SPEAKER_26]: No less than 10, within 10 days, right?

2842
03:51:18,241 --> 03:51:19,242
[SPEAKER_26]: We'll meet within 10 days.

2843
03:51:26,900 --> 03:51:27,200
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

2844
03:51:29,861 --> 03:51:33,003
[SPEAKER_25]: Let's see, so, Councilor Morrell, did you have another?

2845
03:51:33,063 --> 03:51:34,524
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I just had, okay, speak on that.

2846
03:51:34,584 --> 03:51:35,184
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so I'll thank you.

2847
03:51:35,244 --> 03:51:36,044
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, perfect.

2848
03:51:37,345 --> 03:51:37,905
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, so.

2849
03:51:37,985 --> 03:51:40,006
[SPEAKER_22]: So there's no amendment, is that correct?

2850
03:51:41,447 --> 03:51:43,208
[SPEAKER_26]: Is the amendment to meet within 10 days?

2851
03:51:43,468 --> 03:51:45,168
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, the amendment is to meet.

2852
03:51:45,188 --> 03:51:47,049
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll second that amendment, Mr. President.

2853
03:51:47,990 --> 03:51:48,910
[SPEAKER_04]: To meet within 10 days.

2854
03:51:49,130 --> 03:51:49,831
[SPEAKER_26]: You are correct.

2855
03:51:50,831 --> 03:51:52,472
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, let's see, so,

2856
03:51:55,096 --> 03:51:56,036
[SPEAKER_26]: We have a hand raised here.

2857
03:51:56,076 --> 03:51:57,957
[SPEAKER_26]: I believe it's one minute, please.

2858
03:51:57,977 --> 03:52:00,818
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

2859
03:52:05,020 --> 03:52:06,180
[SPEAKER_26]: Chris Bader, name and address.

2860
03:52:06,201 --> 03:52:07,921
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I just want to be, this is Chris Bader.

2861
03:52:08,381 --> 03:52:10,162
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm the head of the historic distribution.

2862
03:52:11,983 --> 03:52:14,004
[SPEAKER_06]: I, oh, I cannot mute myself.

2863
03:52:15,165 --> 03:52:16,065
[SPEAKER_26]: No, we can hear you.

2864
03:52:17,546 --> 03:52:18,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2865
03:52:19,186 --> 03:52:20,227
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to make sure.

2866
03:52:24,400 --> 03:52:25,721
[SPEAKER_06]: We're running out of time here.

2867
03:52:26,141 --> 03:52:28,743
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is a historic house that should be preserved.

2868
03:52:29,444 --> 03:52:44,475
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just want to be sure that bureaucratic people made a lot of comments about how slow everything moves with historic district commissions and the historical commission and so on.

2869
03:52:44,515 --> 03:52:46,456
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is exactly the same thing.

2870
03:52:48,558 --> 03:52:49,258
[SPEAKER_26]: OK.

2871
03:52:49,559 --> 03:52:50,119
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Chris.

2872
03:52:55,360 --> 03:52:59,182
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, any other questions?

2873
03:52:59,582 --> 03:53:01,143
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, hearing and seeing none.

2874
03:53:01,904 --> 03:53:04,525
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, I'm sorry, we've got Jean Nozo has her hand up.

2875
03:53:06,306 --> 03:53:07,707
[SPEAKER_26]: Jean, I'm unmuting you now.

2876
03:53:10,029 --> 03:53:11,550
[SPEAKER_26]: Jean, name and address for the record, please.

2877
03:53:19,795 --> 03:53:19,975
[SPEAKER_26]: Jean?

2878
03:53:28,357 --> 03:53:29,618
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, I don't see Jean.

2879
03:53:43,469 --> 03:53:44,350
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, I don't see Jean.

2880
03:53:44,430 --> 03:53:48,714
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. Clark, do you, she's disappeared off my screen.

2881
03:53:48,794 --> 03:53:50,775
[SPEAKER_26]: I tried unmuting her.

2882
03:53:51,075 --> 03:53:53,858
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, any other questions from the council?

2883
03:53:58,448 --> 03:54:00,529
[SPEAKER_22]: I just, I think I just unmuted Jean.

2884
03:54:01,110 --> 03:54:01,410
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

2885
03:54:02,190 --> 03:54:03,791
[SPEAKER_26]: Jean, name and address for the record, please.

2886
03:54:14,637 --> 03:54:16,738
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. Clerk, I have, she's unmuted.

2887
03:54:21,560 --> 03:54:21,860
[SPEAKER_25]: Jean?

2888
03:54:23,261 --> 03:54:23,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

2889
03:54:23,901 --> 03:54:24,241
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

2890
03:54:26,583 --> 03:54:26,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Mueller?

2891
03:54:30,662 --> 03:54:31,042
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

2892
03:54:31,283 --> 03:54:31,603
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

2893
03:54:32,824 --> 03:54:40,190
[SPEAKER_26]: So it seems like Jean's not with us or she, I think there's a technology issue, but she's been unmuted, but we cannot communicate with her.

2894
03:54:40,210 --> 03:54:52,020
[SPEAKER_26]: So on the motion of, let's see, on the motion of Councilor Niter, furthest to committee the whole, seconded by Councilor Scott Pele as amended by Councilor Morrell.

2895
03:54:52,661 --> 03:54:53,842
[SPEAKER_26]: Clerk, please call the roll.
