    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=204.308s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=205.248s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=207.309s">Madam</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=208.65s">And</a>  I join Councilor Scarpelli in offering my condolences to the family. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=212.935s">Mr.</a>  Garrity was a great person, Lawrence State's resident, known by friends and family alike as Bayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=220.238s">And</a>  I think Councilor Scott Nelly hit the nail on the head. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=223.439s">Although</a>  he's left us here, he's going to leave a legacy behind. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=227.701s">If</a>  it weren't for the Garrity family, I don't think the city would have been in a good position to create the Office of Outreach and Prevention. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=235.384s">But</a>  they came up with this council and they advocated for this story out there, and they helped fight the addiction stigma. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=241.821s">and</a>  it was because of their work that Wisconsin has been able to move forward this season, fighting the epidemic and I just want to echo Councilor Scarpelli's indulgences and also my gratitude for their services.</p>

Zach Bears, Councilor Richard Caraviello, and Councilor Kit Collins to amend Chapter 94, Zoning of the Revised Ordinances, City of Medford, as outlined in paper 23-323. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=572.305s">titled</a>  Proposed Amendments to the Medford Zoning Ordinance for June 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=576.229s">The</a>  hearing was originally opened on August 15th, 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=579.752s">A</a>  link to the public hearing will be posted no later than August 31st, 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=583.835s">The</a>  petition proposes corrections and clarifications for technical discrepancies in addition to one, amending the use of the table of use and parking regulations for each motor vehicle related uses and I miscellaneous commercial uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=597.162s">Two,</a>  amending language regulating multiple principal structures a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=601.086s">Three,</a>  amending language allowing a second associate member of the Board of Appeals. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=605.451s">Four,</a>  eliminating the special permit requirement for inclusionary housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=609.346s">call</a>  781-393-2425 for accommodations, AIDS, TDD 781-393-2516. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=614.027s">The</a>  full materials for the amendment can be viewed in the office of the city clerk, city hall room 103, or on the city's website at medfordma.org slash department slash planning dash development dash sustainability by clicking on current city board filings. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=629.45s">As</a>  stated, we did open this up at our last regular meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=633.03s">This</a>  was presented by Councilors on the <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=636.071s">the</a>  zoning subcommittee, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=638.333s">So</a>  if council would like to give a brief summary, we also have recommendations back from the CD board, which were in our packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=644.837s">I</a>  can review those as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=646.958s">If</a>  councilors want to provide a brief summary, we could also, as there are several, multiple sections, I would be open to whether we want to take this as a whole, if we want to sever this and take this as separate sections, as there are different recommendations from the CD board on different sections. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=663.028s">I</a>  will turn it over to Vice President Bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=665.692s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=666.272s">Thanks,</a>  Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=668.994s">Yeah,</a>  so basically, we received back comments from the Community Development Board on change A. They did suggest a substantive change, which is to, we had recommended that the, or we had initiated a proposal where the council would be the special permit granting authority for a number of <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=688.516s">motor</a>  vehicle related uses and miscellaneous commercial uses, specifically in C1, C2 and I districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=694.759s">This</a>  is designed to prevent the further proliferation of motor vehicle repair shops and car yards in Mystic Ave area and other commercial areas of the city where we're looking at <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=709.356s">other</a>  more significant uses than storage or repair of vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=714.678s">So</a>  I'll come back to that one, because the CD board recommendation is a significant change. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=721.6s">The</a>  second change is B, that's on page three. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=725.781s">The</a>  recodification, that language that we passed had an unintended consequence of making a lot of properties nonconforming, where you have a single parcel with multiple principal structures on the lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=737.485s">The</a>  CD board, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=739.619s">did</a>  suggest a language change just to specify the districts where that issue is occurring, SF1, SF2, and GR zoning, but otherwise they accepted the proposed change. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=752.093s">The</a>  third change is adding a second associate member to the Board of Appeals and clarifying term length. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=759.459s">We</a>  passed a zoning change in early 2022 that did this, but then we actually overruled it with the recodification. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=766.464s">So</a>  this is correcting us back to the language that we had passed for members appointments to the Board of Appeals and having a second associate member. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=776.872s">There</a>  were a number of unintended referrals for papers to the Community Development Board. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=781.385s">This</a>  is now the fourth one, number D. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=785.857s">of</a>  lack of clear language. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=787.178s">Basically</a>  a lot of these are we've had this new zoning recodification in place for now a little bit over a year, and the bodies that are going through it, the Zoning Board of Appeals and the Community Development Board are saying, here are some of the technical things that we think need to be updated. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=799.986s">But</a>  essentially, we're referring papers to the Community Development Board that never needed to go to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=804.328s">So</a>  there's a small technical change. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=806.089s">The</a>  CDB did not change. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=807.49s">Community</a>  Development Board recommendations don't change what we had proposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=812.833s">The</a>  fifth one is number E, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=816.36s">There</a>  was conflict between who is the special permit granting authority, and the Community Development Board recommended specific language to accomplish that objective. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=829.548s">Number</a>  six, F, the language that we passed in 2022 created an extra requirement for a special permit for inclusionary housing that's not necessary, and the Community Development Board accepted the language changes that we proposed for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=846.59s">G,</a>  the state agency that oversees housing changed its name this year from the Department of Housing and Community Development to the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=858.295s">Our</a>  proposed change just updates all of those references in the zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=862.216s">I</a>  think the CD board may have found one or two more. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=868.42s">They</a>  slightly changed the language, just to make it more clear, but basically the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=873.542s">And</a>  then a number of definitions were deleted from the zoning when we recodified it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=879.144s">Several</a>  pages, I think it's pages 10 through, yeah, the whole rest of it, I think, 10 through 21, and the CD board, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=891.095s">agreed</a>  with all the ones that we included, and also found a couple other definitions that had been omitted from the recodification to include. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=897.299s">So</a>  essentially, that's the summary. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=901.002s">If</a>  we were to sever, I would recommend severing change A from changes B through G, or sorry, B through H.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=919.278s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=920.258s">Any</a>  other commentary from the members that have presented the zoning change? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=927.481s">Other</a>  thoughts?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1048.02s">I</a>  would like to ask that Director Hunt and Planner Evans just <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1053.883s">question</a>  about the first change. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1055.685s">Change</a>  A to the use table around motor vehicle related uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1062.372s">It</a>  seems to me that that's the major substance of change in here from the Community Development Board recommendations, which is we had proposed that the council be <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1074.6s">the</a>  Special Permit Granting Authority for a number of these uses, and the Community Development Board has recommended that they be the Special Permit Granting Authority instead, and I was just wondering if you guys could speak to the Community Development Board's reasoning or rationale behind that recommendation.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1098.587s">Madam</a>  President, so in a big picture way, it is actually fairly unusual in communities to have the city council and elected body be deciding on individual businesses because it really leaves it open to a lot of politics and taking politics more into account rather than looking at the general <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1123.833s">and</a>  what's the good fit here? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1126.974s">It</a>  is our understanding that the rationale behind the original proposed changes is because we as a city envision a different situation going on in Mr. Gap, and we don't want to allow a number of uses as of right where we are getting ready to do a more <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1150.154s">Our</a>  recommendation of having the planning board do it is putting it in the hands of people who are planners, either by education or by interest, their work, and to have them sort of make a decision around whether or not a particular business should get a special permit rather than making it a political thing that could be the subject of political <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1173.095s">it's</a>  not a use variance. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1174.196s">It's</a>  a special permit, but basically <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1202.622s">but</a>  you can do it if you come in and ask for a special permit and they're completely discretionary. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1207.845s">You</a>  don't have to say yes to any of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1211.287s">So</a>  it's not like when you're doing a variance, you have like certain tests that you have to meet. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1215.669s">The</a>  special permit test is like, does it fit with the character of the neighborhood? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1219.411s">Does</a>  it fit with what the city wants to see there? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1221.993s">Does</a>  the city want this project? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1223.394s">I</a>  don't know if you wanna clarify any of that at all.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1229.357s">Yeah,</a>  in addition, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1231.658s">As</a>  a staff to the city board, we went through all of the uses and kind of compared it to the comprehensive plan and the zoning districts that would be affected. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1243.203s">And</a>  the city board agreed with the recommendations to add some additional uses to require special permits, particularly like self storage warehouses, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1262.455s">some</a>  other like lower, not the highest and best uses for properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1268.278s">We</a>  get a lot of calls and emails from permit expeditors who are looking to relocate some of these uses that are now getting pushed out of Cambridge, getting pushed out of Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1278.104s">And</a>  so they wanna come here and it's not the best uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1282.507s">So</a>  some locations it might be fine, but switching it to a special permit so we could <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1289.943s">you</a>  know, drill down and actually look at a site specifically, will it work at this site? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1296.211s">That's</a>  why we added some additional ones in addition to the motor vehicle.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1302.539s">Is</a>  that a further question on that?</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1304.722s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1306.744s">Thanks</a>  for that, because I didn't quite notice that, but <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1309.662s">I'm</a>  guessing that's in the J, wholesale transportation, industrial uses, and then it looks like open storage under accessory uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1316.765s">What</a>  was the rationale between, for going to the zoning board for some of them and the city board for others?</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1325.61s">So</a>  looking at, so the use category J, the board of appeals was already the designated special permit granting authority for many of those uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1335.675s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1336.155s">So</a>  to be consistent, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1338.951s">switch</a>  some of the Ys to BA so that they would be in charge of at least that use category so it would make a little bit more sense.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1353.113s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1353.754s">Yeah,</a>  I think in general, the intent here was not to allow these kind of uses by right. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1359.054s">I</a>  like that you at the CD board came back and kind of noted some other specific uses that I think fall into a similar category as what we were looking at with the motor vehicle issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1371.332s">in</a>  general, I'd actually, I mean, Councilor Caraviello proposed this, so I'd like to hear from him what he thinks about it being us versus the Community Development Board.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1378.536s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1383.098s">And</a>  it was done for purposely what you just said about people being pushed out of these other communities, and they're getting better value out of their land, and they're coming over here and taking our good property, and we're getting the short end of the stick. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1397.927s">It</a>  was the intent of this, so I'll take whatever recommendations the board made, but that was my intent when I brought it forward to stop that.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1410.654s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1410.934s">I'm</a>  gonna go to Councilor Knight on Zoom and then Councilor Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1422.79s">Thank</a>  you, President Merlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1423.891s">Thank</a>  you, Director Hunt and Planner Evans for walking us through this. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1428.156s">As</a>  was just stated, I think that the primary goal of putting these changes forward was to remove some of these uses by right because we want to mitigate how much they're encroaching on our <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1438.228s">valuable</a>  land in this area that we could put to many other uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1442.211s">And</a>  it seems like with these recommendations on the slight amendments that the city board sent back, there's kind of a secondary goal of making it more consistent. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1449.317s">Who</a>  is reviewing the special permit applications when they do come in aligning that with the right board to be reviewing it and making sure that the same board is reviewing for the same types of uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1459.805s">So</a>  I think that that is really aligned with what we're trying to do with the zoning ordinance in general, making things both blend with our use goals and also just keeping things more consistent <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1468.59s">user-friendly</a>  inside and outside of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1471.051s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1481.074s">I</a>  just wanted to thank the City Board for getting back to us and for being proactive in suggesting changes and in reviewing the language here. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1491.977s">I</a>  think that, you know, these, the technical aspects, the technical changes are, I think it's hard to argue against them. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1501.442s">The</a>  substantive changes are, I think, are really helpful for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1504.344s">I</a>  think Councilor Caraviello really has explained well over the last few weeks and months why we need something like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1512.429s">I</a>  think this brings us in alignment, in closer alignment with our comprehensive plan, and so, and in preparation of round two of rezoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1521.066s">I</a>  just wanted to express my thanks.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1524.988s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1525.628s">Any</a>  further discussion from the Council? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1528.729s">And</a>  likewise, I think I appreciate the work of the CD board, our PDS, of the Councilors who did a lot of the best majority of this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1536.432s">I</a>  think just understanding, as Councilor Scarpelli will always point out, as Councilor Caraviello, we are absolutely looking at the bigger picture at that next round of zoning, and we're hopefully we'll get out the RFP once more so that we can begin that work being started by <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1548.272s">some</a>  land use experts and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1550.213s">So,</a>  but I appreciate the work being done in the interim to make sure we're addressing some unintended consequences and some things we want to make better for our community as these are living documents. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1559.117s">So,</a>  appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1560.238s">Do</a>  I have a motion?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2176.939s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2178.2s">I</a>  put this paper on. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2178.94s">There's</a>  also a paper on under public participation, which is the next item we're taking up, but maybe we could jointly have the conversation now. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2186.862s">I</a>  don't know if Elliot wants to come up in a minute, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2190.543s">Just</a>  one of the reasons I put this on is that this was something that's been a priority for me since even before I was elected. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2197.915s">Short</a>  term rentals, you know, certainly have a <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2201.864s">limited</a>  place, I think, in the housing world. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2204.967s">But</a>  what we're seeing is a proliferation of a lot of our housing stock being taken up by short-term rentals and being turned into profit centers. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2214.094s">And</a>  we passed a zoning ordinance last year that put significant restrictions on short-term rentals, required registration, required them to pay a registration fee, and also limited their use, where if there is not an owner-occupant in the unit, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2231.52s">And,</a>  you know, if there's an owner occupant renting out rooms, that's one thing, but if there's just a housing unit that's being taken off the long-term rental market and being used for short-term rentals, particularly where you basically have small hotels operating in our neighborhoods, unregulated, we ban that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2249.05s">However,</a>  Airbnb and Vrbo have not stopped listing properties that are doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2255.287s">We</a>  have had residents like Mr. Jockelson and others who have been reporting, you've probably seen them on various social media sites. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2261.29s">I</a>  think there was someone who had a hot tub in a tent in their backyard that they were putting down as a short term rental. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2268.434s">And</a>  that got immediately, you know, code enforcement went out they said that's, you can't do that and it wasn't allowed but <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2275.698s">the</a>  limited code enforcement resources we have in the city really mean that it's on the residents to report these situations. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2283.869s">And</a>  even when they do report them, it takes some time to get some enforcement out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2287.674s">I</a>  really think that we should <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2289.622s">be</a>  more proactive, I think we'd find a lot of rental units coming back onto the market that are currently being used as profit centers in this way, and that would help with our housing crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2298.45s">So,</a>  the two things I'm asking for are that there be more resources and requirements provided to code enforcement so that they can do their job more effectively, but also I do know that thanks to to to Mr. Jopelson and others that <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2313.163s">have</a>  informed me that other cities have had created direct liaison relationships with the major short term rental sites, which have allowed the city to report issues directly to them and have listings removed so that they can't be rented. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2325.132s">So</a>  I think both of those solutions need to be explored quickly and implemented so that our zoning ordinance is being followed by these folks who are breaking the law right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2339.844s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2342.598s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2343.919s">This</a>  is a good ordinance that's been put forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2347.12s">I</a>  think they're being proliferated in all the neighborhoods, not just up in the Tufts University, where that's probably the greatest extent of them, but I have one on my own street. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2356.524s">I</a>  see people just coming down, walking down the street with suitcases. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2359.945s">They're</a>  all over the place. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2360.566s">They're</a>  up in the Heights there. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2361.886s">They're</a>  proliferated everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2362.967s">All</a>  you gotta do is just go on their page and you'd be surprised. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2366.653s">how</a>  many people are doing so. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2368.113s">I</a>  think Boston, I think today, this week, just passed something where they have to be owner-occupied. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2374.335s">Am</a>  I correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2375.295s">I</a>  think I saw that.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2376.715s">I</a>  saw they passed something.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2377.775s">Yeah,</a>  Boston did pass something. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2379.536s">So</a>  I would hope we could pass something similar and maybe tighten up our rules to stop this.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2385.057s">Yeah,</a>  we do have, it does say that if you're renting out, our current ordinance says if you're renting out individual rooms, the owner has to be present.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2392.178s">And</a>  if you're not, you can only do it a maximum of 90 days a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2396.438s">It's</a>  pretty strict. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2396.998s">We</a>  went pretty strict on the first pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2398.659s">I</a>  don't mind going and taking another look, but the most important thing is that the strict ordinance we have now be enforced.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2403.3s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2405.56s">Councilor</a>  Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2406.801s">I</a>  wanted to thank Councilor Bears for putting this on the City Council agenda, to thank Mr. Jockelson for submitting that public participation form with a bunch of research and details about why this is a pressing and urgent issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2425.132s">I</a>  think that this is the ordinance that we passed on short-term rentals is one of the most meaningful things that this council has done. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2432.515s">It's</a>  something that I think many people here had a personal involvement in, particularly Councilor Bears in crafting. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2439.098s">And</a>  it is something that I think we really should be enforcing. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2441.839s">And</a>  I think there's things that have been coming across our desks as a city council in the last few weeks that have really emphasized the need for our city to invest in enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2454.924s">Because</a>  we have good laws in place, we need to make sure that they're carried out. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2461.23s">I</a>  think it's really important to note the distortionary effect that short-term rentals has on housing affordability and rents, both in terms of property values and in terms of rental prices in neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2474.303s">The</a>  National Bureau of Economic Research has been pretty unequivocal in <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2479.649s">in</a>  what it's saying in the economic analyses with how this hurts regular working folks like residents of Medford, like people who are renting in our community, and people who want to buy property in our community, who want to stay in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2496.089s">And</a>  so I think it's really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2497.45s">I</a>  think the proposed solutions from Councilor Bears, I think, would be a very important first step in making sure that we're patching up those holes. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2511.12s">Particularly,</a>  I think it's important to establish more direct relationships with outside entities to make sure that Medford's actually, to reassert our authority and to make sure that we are partnering up <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2525.717s">working</a>  in the spirit of cooperation to make our city better.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2529.138s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2529.458s">Councilor</a>  Collins and Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2532.279s">Thank</a>  you, President Merlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2533.559s">I</a>  also appreciate this being put forward into the constituents that have been advocating about this, some of them for a pretty long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2539.481s">As</a>  Councilor Tseng mentioned, this has been, I mean, this is always coming up, but it's been coming up over the past couple weeks over a couple of different topics. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2549.204s">And</a>  this council has <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2551.605s">spent</a>  a lot of time talking about the lack of code enforcement resources in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2556.029s">This</a>  comes up every budget season. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2557.43s">It's</a>  something that we, and by we, I mean as a city, not as a council, can't seem to fund and expand resources for that department nearly fast enough at the rate that we know there's a clear need for and that residents are on a daily basis observing. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2573.524s">the</a>  need for. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2574.744s">Obviously,</a>  rules are not self-enforcing. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2576.605s">I</a>  think that these suggestions are really good to try to nip in the bud the problem of Airbnbs and things like them proliferating in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2585.388s">And</a>  then we need an expanded code enforcement office to be following up on problems like these and all of the many other problems from potholes to obstructed sidewalks to overgrowth that residents are reporting every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2600.774s">in</a>  our community, and I really do regret and resent that when we exist at these substandard staffing and resource levels for basic city functions, it means that residents have to be code enforcement officers, and I really don't think that's fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2614.041s">I</a>  don't think community members should have to be that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2616.122s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2617.142s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2617.903s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2620.144s">Madam</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2621.965s">I</a>  think it's also very important to point out that this is 100% an enforcement issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2626.799s">And</a>  we do have the controls in place and it's a matter of the administration taking steps that are necessary to ensure that neighborhoods are protected. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2634.681s">So</a>  that's number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2636.101s">And</a>  number two, we also have to think about what's prompting residents in this community to move towards not being landlords and instead being Airbnb operators. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2646.184s">And</a>  some of it has to do with the discussion, I think, about policies that might go into effect in this community in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2652.465s">Some</a>  of it has to do with the fact that there's a lot of strong tenant rights laws <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2656.425s">And</a>  landlords feel like sometimes they're at a disadvantage when they go in to pursue non payment or rent issues and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2663.354s">So</a>  policy that we create also impacts these trends in housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2669.907s">So</a>  it's important for us to look at the big picture as we move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2672.709s">But</a>  I can certainly agree with all my council colleagues and saying that this is 100% enforcement issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2676.931s">And</a>  it's something that needs to be handled the forthright. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2680.713s">Ultimately,</a>  you know, it's about protecting the neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2682.934s">And</a>  right now we're not doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2684.094s">And</a>  that's something we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2685.095s">So</a>  I thank the council for bringing the issue forward.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2688.937s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2691.018s">Any</a>  further discussion from the council at this time? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2696.14s">Any</a>  members of the public wish to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2700.25s">So</a>  on the motion of, I mean, we'll take public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2702.992s">So</a>  on the motion of vice president affairs, seconded by councilor Collins, Mr. Calderon.</p>

highlighted serious violations of the city's short-term rental code at this location, prompting the need for a thorough examination. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2760.652s">Key</a>  points of concern, I want to emphasize that I have taken proactive measures to address this situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2765.546s">I</a>  personally reached out to Medford Code Enforcement Department to report these violations. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2769.689s">See</a>  click issue ID 15172926. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2773.132s">In</a>  response, they promptly conducted an onsite inspection and acknowledged that the apparent violations by issuing an official violation letter to the property owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2781.419s">However,</a>  despite these actions, the property continues to function as an apparent illegal lodging establishment. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2787.023s">At</a>  present, the property remains occupied by a substantial number of guests and is fully booked for the upcoming year. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2793.126s">operational</a>  practices and consequences. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2794.907s">Based</a>  on my investigation, it appears that 66 Lyman Ave is operating in a manner resembling an unauthorized boarding house. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2801.73s">The</a>  proprietors, who reside in Winchester, have been renting individual bedrooms through Airbnb since 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2806.952s">The</a>  operational model has resulted in a continuous influx of approximately six new guests each week for over two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2813.015s">The</a>  practice raises serious concerns about security and potential health hazards for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2817.543s">Security</a>  risks in our neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2818.744s">Beyond</a>  potential code violations, the security risks associated with operating in a legal hotel in a quiet suburban neighborhood are significant. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2825.37s">The</a>  constant turnover of unfamiliar individuals entering and exiting the premises disrupts the tranquility of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2831.209s">The</a>  dynamic presents security concerns that extend beyond the property itself, affecting neighboring houses and streets, the heightened traffic flow, possible disturbances, and the unfamiliarity of temporary occupancy with local safety protocols amplifies these concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2844.415s">Identifying</a>  regulatory barriers, digital evidence listed in CCLX fix report shows that there are several violations of the short-term rental zoning regulations at 66 Lyman Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2854.12s">It</a>  is crucial to investigate potential factors impeding compliance. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2857.381s">Three</a>  key areas of concern include <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2860.074s">Operator's</a>  primary residence requirement is a requirement that a short-term rental property serves as the operator's primary residence appears to be compromised as evidenced by the absence of the owner slash operator and the transportation of supplies from an external location. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2874.44s">Sole</a>  renter party mandate, the practice of renting multiple separate bedrooms of distinct groups as indicated by multiple listings for different bedrooms concurrently raises concerns about compliance with the single party rental mandate and guest count limitation. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2886.985s">The</a>  observed operational activity prompts questions <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2889.557s">about</a>  adherence to the stipulated guest limits for short-term rentals. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2893.338s">Impact</a>  on local rental dynamics. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2895.299s">In</a>  addition to potential regulatory infractions, there are implications for our local rental dynamics. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2899.8s">Short-term</a>  rental practices have led to substantial disparities in rental rates, while traditional year-long lease for comparable property rents for approximately 3,500 per month, the same property on Airbnb commands around 6,000 per month. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2912.904s">This</a>  trend distorts the local rental market, rendering long-term leases less accessible for residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2918.632s">preservation</a>  of our community's well-being. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2920.233s">As</a>  these complexities unfold, it is vital to address the situation promptly. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2923.975s">Upholding</a>  established regulations and safeguarding our community's well-being are paramount. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2928.498s">I</a>  urge you to enforce the new short-term rental codes for 66 Lyman Ave and all other illegal short-term rentals in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2936.483s">Your</a>  thoughtful consideration is highly valued, and I am confident that your appropriate measures will be taken to address this matter in alignment with existing regulations and the best interests of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2945.308s">Sincerely,</a>  Elliot Jockelson, 60 Marshall Street, Medford. <a

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3074.439s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Elliot Jokelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3076.421s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3076.961s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3078.323s">That's</a>  embarrassing.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3078.963s">And</a>  if I could just, I just do want to reiterate Councilor Knight's point, which I tried to make clear in my resolution just prior to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3088.398s">Two</a>  things are clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3089.119s">I've</a>  talked I've been working with Elliot talking to code enforcement about this I've been hearing from other folks about You know different issues code enforcement goes out when they hear about it, but they Basically the way we're doing code enforcement city generally in the way that it's structured is not what it needs to be you know essentially <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3109.005s">The</a>  building departments code enforcement, and they're more focused on things like this and building inspection.</p>

    <p>[Elliot Jokelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3113.508s">Dennis</a>  came straight and they came straight out. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3115.629s">Yeah,</a>  they looked at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3116.59s">They</a>  were professional. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3117.651s">It</a>  wasn't them. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3118.151s">It's</a>  just they don't have the teeth. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3120.893s">Exactly</a>  the staff.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3121.813s">And</a>  yeah, and that's what I'm that's what I'm getting at. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3123.674s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3123.935s">Like</a>  they're doing great. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3124.915s">They're</a>  doing an awesome job. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3125.996s">I'm</a>  talking to them directly about what they need. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3128.538s">And</a>  you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3130.259s">essentially,</a>  you know, they've been doing, there should be a code enforcement officer at DPW looking at stuff in the public way. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3136.24s">The</a>  building department's been covering for that for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3139.021s">I</a>  think we need to have a serious discussion about inspectional services and code enforcement in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3143.682s">What's</a>  the resource level? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3144.942s">How</a>  are they collaborating? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3146.002s">Which</a>  departments are doing each job? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3147.442s">Because</a>  clearly, on this issue, I think we're about to hear another major issue about overgrowth and trash and issues in <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3156.013s">on</a>  Emory Street tonight, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3158.535s">Clearly</a>  they don't have the resources and the support they need. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3161.396s">The</a>  flip side of that is we can advocate, we pass the zoning ordinance, we communicate when we can, when we hear from a resident or we hear from code enforcement, we try to make those links. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3171.342s">Actually</a>  funding or making a structural change to how we do inspectional services, only the mayor has the power to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3178.647s">Actually</a>  saying, hey, code enforcement, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3181.168s">You</a>  know, we need to prioritize creating an Airbnb liaison, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3185.05s">Only</a>  the mayor can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3186.131s">So</a>  does the mayor watch this?</p>

    <p>[Elliot Jokelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3188.072s">I</a>  don't know if the mayor is watching please shut all these Airbnbs down immediately because I'm just curious like about 66 Lyman Well, I mean, thank you for having me here. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3198.297s">What's</a>  the next step? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3199.157s">Like</a>  I had the police out here today. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3200.718s">There's</a>  three more cars coming tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3202.939s">There's</a>  a <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3204.183s">18</a>  more cars coming next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3207.387s">That's</a>  part of the reason why I came here because I've spoken to code enforcement, I've spoken to the city council now. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3215.214s">I'm</a>  still unclear what the process is for getting this shut down. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3218.537s">I'm</a>  in the dark and every day I'm looking outside my kitchen window and I'm seeing three new cars blow up.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3223.846s">Right,</a>  and that's kind of why I'm making the statement I'm making is we've now put a resolution on, our resolutions generally get a response from the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3232.108s">The</a>  point of this resolution is to say, hey, we need to make this a priority, it's our request, please respond and tell us when and how you're going to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3239.97s">Right</a>  now, all I can do is we can have another email or phone conversation with Dennis or Mike and we can- I'm gonna email the mayor next, but I'm gonna keep watching and annoying people until this house is shut down.</p>

    <p>[Elliot Jokelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3250.572s">I'm</a>  not going away, I'm the- <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3253.491s">the</a>  like miser of Marshall Street or whatever.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3255.733s">I</a>  don't know what you want to call it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3257.054s">The</a>  campsite was shut down, so there is precedence.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3259.597s">Yes,</a>  exactly. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3261.038s">And</a>  so, you know, that's what I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3263.04s">I</a>  want to be clear that we have our eyes on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3265.021s">We've</a>  been working on this legislatively. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3267.162s">We're</a>  going to be pushing for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3268.883s">It's</a>  a partnership in a two-way street in terms of we can make the request, but the action has to come from the office of the mayor, because that's who runs enforcement and who supervises the staff of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3278.87s">So-</a>  Well, now that I've spoken to you, I will now go and try and pursue it there. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3283.232s">Yeah,</a>  and I'm happy to help on that direction too. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3286.194s">I</a>  would love to have a conversation with the council and the mayor and code enforcement about what should inspectional services look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3293.993s">in</a>  the city as well.</p>

    <p>[Elliot Jokelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3294.673s">It's</a>  so easy to shut it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3296.173s">You</a>  could change the entire city in a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3298.494s">Yeah,</a>  if you had the right. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3299.694s">Anyway,</a>  thank you so much.</p>

    <p>[Elliot Jokelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3373.291s">any</a>  precedent for like a, like a, like citizen task force that helps them? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3379.394s">I</a>  mean, sure, there's a lot of people that will be interested.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3381.295s">Well,</a>  they don't have a citizen task, but doesn't have legal authority.</p>

    <p>[Elliot Jokelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3384.597s">But</a>  I mean, I mean, other than other than providing information to them in a certain way, where they can look at it and say, Okay, this is an Airbnb house, and they don't have to spend any time on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3392.261s">Other</a>  than that, you know, something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3393.562s">I</a>  don't know.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3394.182s">I</a>  mean, yes, I say, you know, as fast as you bring it to our attention, you call me or you call councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3399.445s">Oh,</a>  I'll <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3401.246s">I'll</a>  call in as fast as you give them to me.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3403.387s">Point</a>  of information, Madam Mayor, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3407.909s">I</a>  think what you're doing is unbelievable. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3411.071s">What</a>  you're doing right now is a good example for the rest of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3414.352s">We</a>  don't have to have a task force, just people caring about the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3417.114s">We're</a>  going to hear that about, you know, Emory Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3419.995s">It's</a>  people that are reaching out to us that unfortunately we don't have the court enforcement department we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3425.317s">I</a>  agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3426.698s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3428.179s">I</a>  said, you know, I'm around during the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3430.341s">You</a>  call me, I'll come and help you.</p>

    <p>[Elliot Jokelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3431.902s">I</a>  appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3432.743s">But</a>  one of the things I'm only here 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3434.644s">One</a>  of the things that really frustrates me about the city is I don't want to have to call one person. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3438.107s">I</a>  want to thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3439.007s">I</a>  want to like, where do I go online to make the report? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3442.23s">Who</a>  do I speak to in three weeks when it doesn't get done? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3444.392s">And</a>  then what are the consequences? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3446.553s">I</a>  don't want to have to, I've been on this and thank you so much for offering that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3449.756s">But</a>  I've been on it for like two years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3451.717s">I</a>  don't have any more time. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3452.978s">I</a>  know, you get a job, you get a job. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3455.099s">And</a>  I'm saying that to you guys, you guys spent so much time for little rewards. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3458.881s">So</a>  I appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3460.462s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3461.123s">And</a>  I just want to add, I think on this specific one, you found the answer, which is we should just be saying directly to the company, you have to remove the listing.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3466.826s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3467.086s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3467.346s">And</a>  that, that, that strips out the entire process. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3470.088s">And</a>  then, you know, you have the people with the authority to make that from the city side who have the legal authority to have that enforcement happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3478.633s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3480.342s">And</a>  sometimes it takes a little push from us. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3482.524s">Like</a>  I say, I went up to Emory Street, I took some pictures, I sent them over to the DPW and the expression. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3487.989s">I</a>  mean, and we'll talk about that later, but sometimes it takes that little extra push from somebody to get up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3493.493s">So</a>  if you got something, please, my number's listed, call, I'm gonna say I'm around all day long. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3499.078s">I</a>  appreciate that, thank you very much.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3502.061s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3504.059s">This</a>  is public participation, and I see some folks online with hands up, and I know folks want to speak in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3508.944s">So</a>  I'm going to go to Eunice on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3511.406s">I</a>  will ask you to unmute. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3514.228s">And</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3514.669s">Hi,</a>  good evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3516.831s">Thank</a>  you very much for allowing me to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3519.713s">So</a>  my question is this.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3520.734s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please?</p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3523.097s">Oh,</a>  I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3523.897s">Eunice</a>  Browne, Greenleaf Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3527.522s">I</a>  have two houses on my street, two families that are getting ready to close with new owners this month. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3537.829s">And</a>  particularly the one next door to me, but the other one is four houses up. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3542.952s">I'm</a>  very fearful of what's to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3546.674s">I</a>  don't know what their intentions are, but if their intentions are to run an Airbnb, and they've bought the property specifically for that purpose, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3558.783s">How</a>  are we nipping these in the bud? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3561.545s">If</a>  the people next door to me thought, well, I'll buy this two-family, I'll turn it into an Airbnb, hey, I've got a gold mine here. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3572.754s">First</a>  of all, they can't do this, from what I understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3576.197s">They</a>  can't just turn this two-family into a hotel, so to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3582.376s">Do</a>  they know that they can't do this? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3584.117s">Do</a>  they know that they have to go and register? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3586.137s">Or</a>  are you folks on the city side just counting on the fact that a couple of months in, I'm going to see a rotating cast of characters in here in different cars where Greenleaf's parking is already tight enough, as I'm sure you all know, and a rotating cast of characters. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3609.123s">Is</a>  there any way to proactively <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3611.442s">know,</a>  before these people do this, tell them that they can't do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3617.186s">And</a>  then maybe they'll go look elsewhere.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3618.787s">I</a>  guess we did just recently passed the housing stability notification ordinance, which is about providing renters with information they need to know about renting in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3629.433s">So</a>  I'm sure there's something we could explore as far as providing new owners information like this that lets them know about regulations as far as short term rentals, directing them to this <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3641.26s">zoning</a>  code, something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3642.98s">Councilor</a>  Tseng?</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3643.701s">And</a>  it might be helpful to do more for the city to do more outreach to realtors and to folks who are helping sell the properties to let them know that they should inform their clients that that use is off the table.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3661.205s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3662.266s">Councilor</a>  Collins?</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3664.056s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell, and I appreciate this bringing forward because it's, you know, essentially an example of what we've been talking about is what can we do to make it so these problems aren't happening in the first place. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3673.878s">And</a>  I think the housing stability notification ordinance is a good example because that's using our existing city communication channels just to distribute what is information that's already existing rules that already exist, you know, using an existing communication channel. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3689.762s">I</a>  think that that paired with having a liaison to <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3692.947s">you</a>  know, Airbnb or a similar company, these are ways of saying, hey, before anybody starts doing anything that you may not know in good faith that you shouldn't be doing, here's how things work in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3702.674s">That</a>  paired with more robust enforcement, I think that that's what we should be rolling out for every, you know, all of these frequent flyer city problems that we know we see all the time.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3711.02s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3711.66s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3712.18s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3713.942s">Madam</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3715.803s">I</a>  look at this in a couple of different ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3718.905s">The</a>  first of which is, you know, all of this, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3722.29s">getting</a>  involved between someone trying to sell a house and someone trying to buy a house and the regulations and restrictions that surround it is part of the due diligence process when you're purchasing a home. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3734.222s">or</a>  when you're purchasing a piece of property. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3736.643s">And</a>  I know that that's a process that's heavily regulated as it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3742.505s">I</a>  think we better be very careful in how far we're going to be going in performing the due diligence for these private landowners conducting private land transactions. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3753.23s">So,</a>  with that being said, you know, I can certainly see the issue going on with the lack of enforcement of BMPs in the community, the strict code that we've established that would provide you only 90 days a year for rental. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3765.678s">But</a>  at the end of the day, you know, I think that there has to be a spot where government doesn't get so involved in people's lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3771.322s">So,</a>  we have to draw our line somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3772.823s">And</a>  I think that when that line is doing the due diligence for <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3778.638s">potential</a>  homebuyers. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3780.679s">It</a>  just doesn't really fall within the scope of what a government service is. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3784.5s">And</a>  I think that at the end of the day, we'd be providing far too much energy and effort and performing an exercise that's not going to reap great results. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3792.903s">I</a>  think we'd be much better off putting our energy, efforts, and time into enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3798.624s">So</a>  that's where I stand on this matter, but thank you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3800.325s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3803.366s">Going</a>  to Sneha on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3805.707s">I</a>  will unmute you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3811.621s">and</a>  name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Sneha]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3813.542s">Hi,</a>  Deb. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3814.222s">This</a>  is Sneha. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3815.683s">My</a>  address is 108 Medford Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3819.685s">I</a>  understand this discussion is rightly so about enforcement, but I just wanted to introduce a note of skepticism in that regard because honestly, just hearing about neighbors sort of keeping an eye on the number plates coming in and who's coming in, who's coming out and having this, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3840.631s">It</a>  almost sounds like a kind of vigilantism, which is very terrifying to me, frankly speaking, because I think as much as we care about going by the book and making sure homeowners don't exploit certain loopholes in the law, we should also be careful about not building up a resistance to any kind of outsider as a sentiment coming into the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3867.191s">So</a>  I just wanted to have that on the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3870.622s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3872.524s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3872.844s">Is</a>  there anyone else who would like to speak for public participation at this time? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3878.91s">Please</a>  come up to the mic. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3882.012s">And</a>  I know we have multiple folks for public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3884.094s">We</a>  still have an agenda that folks are here for as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3886.296s">So</a>  I will be enforcing the council rules, five minutes each for public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3892.161s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Maryanne Adduci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3897.284s">Yep,</a>  it's on, there you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3898.344s">Hi,</a>  Mary Anna Ducey, 2 North Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3901.665s">I'm</a>  here tonight because I wanted to call attention to the fact, you all know that Walkland Court is being redeveloped. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3910.588s">They</a>  have had meetings for the community, but the community doesn't feel as though our voices are being heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3920.313s">So</a>  in talking to the residents in the neighborhood, I decided that maybe we should do a petition to see what gauged the sentiment of the community, which I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3931.786s">And</a>  I'm going to give you a copy tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3934.189s">I'm</a>  going to also present this tomorrow night because the Community Development Board is going to have a meeting on the zoning there. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3941.357s">Now,</a>  basically, the neighborhood around Walkley Court is not opposed to rebuilding, renovating, upgrading, or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3950.602s">It's</a>  the size and the scale that they're proposing there. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3954.804s">They're</a>  cramming, we feel, too many people in too small an area, and they're putting six-story buildings in a residential neighborhood besides single-family homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3966.428s">So</a>  I have all the issues that the residents are concerned about in the petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3973.75s">And</a>  for your information, there's very strong, and I mean very strong opposition to this, of the design, not the fact that they're going to redevelop the community, but it's to the... I'd like to get the names on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3990.775s">And</a>  this is for the clerks, for the permanent. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3996.255s">I</a>  have collected 1,131 signatures opposing the current design. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4004.182s">99%</a>  of the people that I've approached signed. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4007.605s">They</a>  don't know anything about this, most of them, so I showed them a copy of the design that's being proposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4015.292s">I</a>  have to educate everybody on what's going on there because they've only notified people about the change within 400 feet of the complex. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4024.113s">Now,</a>  everybody's touting the fact that it's gonna be good for the housing authority and they're gonna add this, but what is it doing to the neighborhood? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4035.163s">There</a>  has to be some compromise here. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4037.565s">Yes,</a>  we'll be supportive of whatever they wanna do there, but within reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4043.53s">They</a>  have to consider the neighborhood and how it's gonna affect the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4048.16s">So</a>  all the points that have been raised are in the handout that I gave you tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4054.625s">And</a>  the copy of the permanent sign petition is gonna be filed with the clerk's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4060.59s">Tomorrow</a>  night at the 6.30, well actually during the day tomorrow, I'm going to the community development office and give them their copy. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4067.375s">But</a>  since the city council was meeting tonight, I thought you should have your copy tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4071.879s">So</a>  I'd be happy to answer any questions if you people have any. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4078.243s">but</a>  I want you to know that the community needs some help in mediating what the housing authority wants to do and what is good for the residents of the city of Medford.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4091.633s">Thank</a>  you, Mary. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4092.113s">We</a>  are going to be holding as committee of the whole next Tuesday with the executive director of Medford Housing Authority on this project to get an update, to hear from residents and address concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4104.061s">So</a>  we will be hosting that as a committee of the whole next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4106.143s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Maryanne Adduci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4106.363s">Well,</a>  the points that I bring out in the letter should help you start that conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4112.107s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4112.847s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4115.949s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4116.309s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4119.151s">Going</a>  to Councilor Knight, unless your hand is still up.</p>
