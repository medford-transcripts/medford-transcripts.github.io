    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=204.308s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=205.248s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=207.309s">Madam</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=208.65s">And</a>  I join Councilor Scarpelli in offering my condolences to the family. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=212.935s">Mr.</a>  Garrity was a great person, Lawrence State's resident, known by friends and family alike as Bayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=220.238s">And</a>  I think Councilor Scott Nelly hit the nail on the head. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=223.439s">Although</a>  he's left us here, he's going to leave a legacy behind. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=227.701s">If</a>  it weren't for the Garrity family, I don't think the city would have been in a good position to create the Office of Outreach and Prevention. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=235.384s">But</a>  they came up with this council and they advocated for this story out there, and they helped fight the addiction stigma. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=241.821s">and</a>  it was because of their work that Wisconsin has been able to move forward this season, fighting the epidemic and I just want to echo Councilor Scarpelli's indulgences and also my gratitude for their services.</p>

Zach Bears, Councilor Richard Caraviello, and Councilor Kit Collins to amend Chapter 94, Zoning of the Revised Ordinances, City of Medford, as outlined in paper 23-323. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=572.305s">titled</a>  Proposed Amendments to the Medford Zoning Ordinance for June 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=576.229s">The</a>  hearing was originally opened on August 15th, 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=579.752s">A</a>  link to the public hearing will be posted no later than August 31st, 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=583.835s">The</a>  petition proposes corrections and clarifications for technical discrepancies in addition to one, amending the use of the table of use and parking regulations for each motor vehicle related uses and I miscellaneous commercial uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=597.162s">Two,</a>  amending language regulating multiple principal structures a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=601.086s">Three,</a>  amending language allowing a second associate member of the Board of Appeals. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=605.451s">Four,</a>  eliminating the special permit requirement for inclusionary housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=609.346s">call</a>  781-393-2425 for accommodations, AIDS, TDD 781-393-2516. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=614.027s">The</a>  full materials for the amendment can be viewed in the office of the city clerk, city hall room 103, or on the city's website at medfordma.org slash department slash planning dash development dash sustainability by clicking on current city board filings. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=629.45s">As</a>  stated, we did open this up at our last regular meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=633.03s">This</a>  was presented by Councilors on the <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=636.071s">the</a>  zoning subcommittee, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=638.333s">So</a>  if council would like to give a brief summary, we also have recommendations back from the CD board, which were in our packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=644.837s">I</a>  can review those as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=646.958s">If</a>  councilors want to provide a brief summary, we could also, as there are several, multiple sections, I would be open to whether we want to take this as a whole, if we want to sever this and take this as separate sections, as there are different recommendations from the CD board on different sections. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=663.028s">I</a>  will turn it over to Vice President Bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=665.692s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=666.272s">Thanks,</a>  Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=668.994s">Yeah,</a>  so basically, we received back comments from the Community Development Board on change A. They did suggest a substantive change, which is to, we had recommended that the, or we had initiated a proposal where the council would be the special permit granting authority for a number of <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=688.516s">motor</a>  vehicle related uses and miscellaneous commercial uses, specifically in C1, C2 and I districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=694.759s">This</a>  is designed to prevent the further proliferation of motor vehicle repair shops and car yards in Mystic Ave area and other commercial areas of the city where we're looking at <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=709.356s">other</a>  more significant uses than storage or repair of vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=714.678s">So</a>  I'll come back to that one, because the CD board recommendation is a significant change. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=721.6s">The</a>  second change is B, that's on page three. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=725.781s">The</a>  recodification, that language that we passed had an unintended consequence of making a lot of properties nonconforming, where you have a single parcel with multiple principal structures on the lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=737.485s">The</a>  CD board, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=739.619s">did</a>  suggest a language change just to specify the districts where that issue is occurring, SF1, SF2, and GR zoning, but otherwise they accepted the proposed change. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=752.093s">The</a>  third change is adding a second associate member to the Board of Appeals and clarifying term length. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=759.459s">We</a>  passed a zoning change in early 2022 that did this, but then we actually overruled it with the recodification. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=766.464s">So</a>  this is correcting us back to the language that we had passed for members appointments to the Board of Appeals and having a second associate member. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=776.872s">There</a>  were a number of unintended referrals for papers to the Community Development Board. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=781.385s">This</a>  is now the fourth one, number D. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=785.857s">of</a>  lack of clear language. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=787.178s">Basically</a>  a lot of these are we've had this new zoning recodification in place for now a little bit over a year, and the bodies that are going through it, the Zoning Board of Appeals and the Community Development Board are saying, here are some of the technical things that we think need to be updated. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=799.986s">But</a>  essentially, we're referring papers to the Community Development Board that never needed to go to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=804.328s">So</a>  there's a small technical change. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=806.089s">The</a>  CDB did not change. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=807.49s">Community</a>  Development Board recommendations don't change what we had proposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=812.833s">The</a>  fifth one is number E, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=816.36s">There</a>  was conflict between who is the special permit granting authority, and the Community Development Board recommended specific language to accomplish that objective. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=829.548s">Number</a>  six, F, the language that we passed in 2022 created an extra requirement for a special permit for inclusionary housing that's not necessary, and the Community Development Board accepted the language changes that we proposed for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=846.59s">G,</a>  the state agency that oversees housing changed its name this year from the Department of Housing and Community Development to the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=858.295s">Our</a>  proposed change just updates all of those references in the zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=862.216s">I</a>  think the CD board may have found one or two more. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=868.42s">They</a>  slightly changed the language, just to make it more clear, but basically the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=873.542s">And</a>  then a number of definitions were deleted from the zoning when we recodified it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=879.144s">Several</a>  pages, I think it's pages 10 through, yeah, the whole rest of it, I think, 10 through 21, and the CD board, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=891.095s">agreed</a>  with all the ones that we included, and also found a couple other definitions that had been omitted from the recodification to include. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=897.299s">So</a>  essentially, that's the summary. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=901.002s">If</a>  we were to sever, I would recommend severing change A from changes B through G, or sorry, B through H.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=919.278s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=920.258s">Any</a>  other commentary from the members that have presented the zoning change? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=927.481s">Other</a>  thoughts?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1048.02s">I</a>  would like to ask that Director Hunt and Planner Evans just <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1053.883s">question</a>  about the first change. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1055.685s">Change</a>  A to the use table around motor vehicle related uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1062.372s">It</a>  seems to me that that's the major substance of change in here from the Community Development Board recommendations, which is we had proposed that the council be <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1074.6s">the</a>  Special Permit Granting Authority for a number of these uses, and the Community Development Board has recommended that they be the Special Permit Granting Authority instead, and I was just wondering if you guys could speak to the Community Development Board's reasoning or rationale behind that recommendation.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1098.587s">Madam</a>  President, so in a big picture way, it is actually fairly unusual in communities to have the city council and elected body be deciding on individual businesses because it really leaves it open to a lot of politics and taking politics more into account rather than looking at the general <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1123.833s">and</a>  what's the good fit here? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1126.974s">It</a>  is our understanding that the rationale behind the original proposed changes is because we as a city envision a different situation going on in Mr. Gap, and we don't want to allow a number of uses as of right where we are getting ready to do a more <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1150.154s">Our</a>  recommendation of having the planning board do it is putting it in the hands of people who are planners, either by education or by interest, their work, and to have them sort of make a decision around whether or not a particular business should get a special permit rather than making it a political thing that could be the subject of political <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1173.095s">it's</a>  not a use variance. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1174.196s">It's</a>  a special permit, but basically <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1202.622s">but</a>  you can do it if you come in and ask for a special permit and they're completely discretionary. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1207.845s">You</a>  don't have to say yes to any of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1211.287s">So</a>  it's not like when you're doing a variance, you have like certain tests that you have to meet. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1215.669s">The</a>  special permit test is like, does it fit with the character of the neighborhood? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1219.411s">Does</a>  it fit with what the city wants to see there? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1221.993s">Does</a>  the city want this project? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1223.394s">I</a>  don't know if you wanna clarify any of that at all.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1229.357s">Yeah,</a>  in addition, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1231.658s">As</a>  a staff to the city board, we went through all of the uses and kind of compared it to the comprehensive plan and the zoning districts that would be affected. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1243.203s">And</a>  the city board agreed with the recommendations to add some additional uses to require special permits, particularly like self storage warehouses, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1262.455s">some</a>  other like lower, not the highest and best uses for properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1268.278s">We</a>  get a lot of calls and emails from permit expeditors who are looking to relocate some of these uses that are now getting pushed out of Cambridge, getting pushed out of Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1278.104s">And</a>  so they wanna come here and it's not the best uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1282.507s">So</a>  some locations it might be fine, but switching it to a special permit so we could <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1289.943s">you</a>  know, drill down and actually look at a site specifically, will it work at this site? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1296.211s">That's</a>  why we added some additional ones in addition to the motor vehicle.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1302.539s">Is</a>  that a further question on that?</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1304.722s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1306.744s">Thanks</a>  for that, because I didn't quite notice that, but <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1309.662s">I'm</a>  guessing that's in the J, wholesale transportation, industrial uses, and then it looks like open storage under accessory uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1316.765s">What</a>  was the rationale between, for going to the zoning board for some of them and the city board for others?</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1325.61s">So</a>  looking at, so the use category J, the board of appeals was already the designated special permit granting authority for many of those uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1335.675s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1336.155s">So</a>  to be consistent, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1338.951s">switch</a>  some of the Ys to BA so that they would be in charge of at least that use category so it would make a little bit more sense.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1353.113s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1353.754s">Yeah,</a>  I think in general, the intent here was not to allow these kind of uses by right. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1359.054s">I</a>  like that you at the CD board came back and kind of noted some other specific uses that I think fall into a similar category as what we were looking at with the motor vehicle issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1371.332s">in</a>  general, I'd actually, I mean, Councilor Caraviello proposed this, so I'd like to hear from him what he thinks about it being us versus the Community Development Board.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1378.536s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1383.098s">And</a>  it was done for purposely what you just said about people being pushed out of these other communities, and they're getting better value out of their land, and they're coming over here and taking our good property, and we're getting the short end of the stick. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1397.927s">It</a>  was the intent of this, so I'll take whatever recommendations the board made, but that was my intent when I brought it forward to stop that.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1410.654s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1410.934s">I'm</a>  gonna go to Councilor Knight on Zoom and then Councilor Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1422.79s">Thank</a>  you, President Merlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1423.891s">Thank</a>  you, Director Hunt and Planner Evans for walking us through this. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1428.156s">As</a>  was just stated, I think that the primary goal of putting these changes forward was to remove some of these uses by right because we want to mitigate how much they're encroaching on our <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1438.228s">valuable</a>  land in this area that we could put to many other uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1442.211s">And</a>  it seems like with these recommendations on the slight amendments that the city board sent back, there's kind of a secondary goal of making it more consistent. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1449.317s">Who</a>  is reviewing the special permit applications when they do come in aligning that with the right board to be reviewing it and making sure that the same board is reviewing for the same types of uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1459.805s">So</a>  I think that that is really aligned with what we're trying to do with the zoning ordinance in general, making things both blend with our use goals and also just keeping things more consistent <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1468.59s">user-friendly</a>  inside and outside of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1471.051s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1481.074s">I</a>  just wanted to thank the City Board for getting back to us and for being proactive in suggesting changes and in reviewing the language here. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1491.977s">I</a>  think that, you know, these, the technical aspects, the technical changes are, I think it's hard to argue against them. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1501.442s">The</a>  substantive changes are, I think, are really helpful for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1504.344s">I</a>  think Councilor Caraviello really has explained well over the last few weeks and months why we need something like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1512.429s">I</a>  think this brings us in alignment, in closer alignment with our comprehensive plan, and so, and in preparation of round two of rezoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1521.066s">I</a>  just wanted to express my thanks.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1524.988s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1525.628s">Any</a>  further discussion from the Council? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1528.729s">And</a>  likewise, I think I appreciate the work of the CD board, our PDS, of the Councilors who did a lot of the best majority of this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1536.432s">I</a>  think just understanding, as Councilor Scarpelli will always point out, as Councilor Caraviello, we are absolutely looking at the bigger picture at that next round of zoning, and we're hopefully we'll get out the RFP once more so that we can begin that work being started by <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1548.272s">some</a>  land use experts and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1550.213s">So,</a>  but I appreciate the work being done in the interim to make sure we're addressing some unintended consequences and some things we want to make better for our community as these are living documents. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1559.117s">So,</a>  appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1560.238s">Do</a>  I have a motion?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2176.939s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2178.2s">I</a>  put this paper on. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2178.94s">There's</a>  also a paper on under public participation, which is the next item we're taking up, but maybe we could jointly have the conversation now. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2186.862s">I</a>  don't know if Elliot wants to come up in a minute, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2190.543s">Just</a>  one of the reasons I put this on is that this was something that's been a priority for me since even before I was elected. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2197.915s">Short</a>  term rentals, you know, certainly have a <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2201.864s">limited</a>  place, I think, in the housing world. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2204.967s">But</a>  what we're seeing is a proliferation of a lot of our housing stock being taken up by short-term rentals and being turned into profit centers. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2214.094s">And</a>  we passed a zoning ordinance last year that put significant restrictions on short-term rentals, required registration, required them to pay a registration fee, and also limited their use, where if there is not an owner-occupant in the unit, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2231.52s">And,</a>  you know, if there's an owner occupant renting out rooms, that's one thing, but if there's just a housing unit that's being taken off the long-term rental market and being used for short-term rentals, particularly where you basically have small hotels operating in our neighborhoods, unregulated, we ban that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2249.05s">However,</a>  Airbnb and Vrbo have not stopped listing properties that are doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2255.287s">We</a>  have had residents like Mr. Jockelson and others who have been reporting, you've probably seen them on various social media sites. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2261.29s">I</a>  think there was someone who had a hot tub in a tent in their backyard that they were putting down as a short term rental. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2268.434s">And</a>  that got immediately, you know, code enforcement went out they said that's, you can't do that and it wasn't allowed but <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2275.698s">the</a>  limited code enforcement resources we have in the city really mean that it's on the residents to report these situations. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2283.869s">And</a>  even when they do report them, it takes some time to get some enforcement out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2287.674s">I</a>  really think that we should <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2289.622s">be</a>  more proactive, I think we'd find a lot of rental units coming back onto the market that are currently being used as profit centers in this way, and that would help with our housing crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2298.45s">So,</a>  the two things I'm asking for are that there be more resources and requirements provided to code enforcement so that they can do their job more effectively, but also I do know that thanks to to to Mr. Jopelson and others that <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2313.163s">have</a>  informed me that other cities have had created direct liaison relationships with the major short term rental sites, which have allowed the city to report issues directly to them and have listings removed so that they can't be rented. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2325.132s">So</a>  I think both of those solutions need to be explored quickly and implemented so that our zoning ordinance is being followed by these folks who are breaking the law right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2339.844s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2342.598s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2343.919s">This</a>  is a good ordinance that's been put forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2347.12s">I</a>  think they're being proliferated in all the neighborhoods, not just up in the Tufts University, where that's probably the greatest extent of them, but I have one on my own street. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2356.524s">I</a>  see people just coming down, walking down the street with suitcases. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2359.945s">They're</a>  all over the place. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2360.566s">They're</a>  up in the Heights there. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2361.886s">They're</a>  proliferated everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2362.967s">All</a>  you gotta do is just go on their page and you'd be surprised. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2366.653s">how</a>  many people are doing so. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2368.113s">I</a>  think Boston, I think today, this week, just passed something where they have to be owner-occupied. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2374.335s">Am</a>  I correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2375.295s">I</a>  think I saw that.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2376.715s">I</a>  saw they passed something.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2377.775s">Yeah,</a>  Boston did pass something. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2379.536s">So</a>  I would hope we could pass something similar and maybe tighten up our rules to stop this.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2385.057s">Yeah,</a>  we do have, it does say that if you're renting out, our current ordinance says if you're renting out individual rooms, the owner has to be present.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2392.178s">And</a>  if you're not, you can only do it a maximum of 90 days a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2396.438s">It's</a>  pretty strict. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2396.998s">We</a>  went pretty strict on the first pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2398.659s">I</a>  don't mind going and taking another look, but the most important thing is that the strict ordinance we have now be enforced.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2403.3s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2405.56s">Councilor</a>  Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2406.801s">I</a>  wanted to thank Councilor Bears for putting this on the City Council agenda, to thank Mr. Jockelson for submitting that public participation form with a bunch of research and details about why this is a pressing and urgent issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2425.132s">I</a>  think that this is the ordinance that we passed on short-term rentals is one of the most meaningful things that this council has done. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2432.515s">It's</a>  something that I think many people here had a personal involvement in, particularly Councilor Bears in crafting. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2439.098s">And</a>  it is something that I think we really should be enforcing. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2441.839s">And</a>  I think there's things that have been coming across our desks as a city council in the last few weeks that have really emphasized the need for our city to invest in enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2454.924s">Because</a>  we have good laws in place, we need to make sure that they're carried out. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2461.23s">I</a>  think it's really important to note the distortionary effect that short-term rentals has on housing affordability and rents, both in terms of property values and in terms of rental prices in neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2474.303s">The</a>  National Bureau of Economic Research has been pretty unequivocal in <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2479.649s">in</a>  what it's saying in the economic analyses with how this hurts regular working folks like residents of Medford, like people who are renting in our community, and people who want to buy property in our community, who want to stay in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2496.089s">And</a>  so I think it's really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2497.45s">I</a>  think the proposed solutions from Councilor Bears, I think, would be a very important first step in making sure that we're patching up those holes. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2511.12s">Particularly,</a>  I think it's important to establish more direct relationships with outside entities to make sure that Medford's actually, to reassert our authority and to make sure that we are partnering up <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2525.717s">working</a>  in the spirit of cooperation to make our city better.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2529.138s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2529.458s">Councilor</a>  Collins and Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2532.279s">Thank</a>  you, President Merlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2533.559s">I</a>  also appreciate this being put forward into the constituents that have been advocating about this, some of them for a pretty long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2539.481s">As</a>  Councilor Tseng mentioned, this has been, I mean, this is always coming up, but it's been coming up over the past couple weeks over a couple of different topics. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2549.204s">And</a>  this council has <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2551.605s">spent</a>  a lot of time talking about the lack of code enforcement resources in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2556.029s">This</a>  comes up every budget season. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2557.43s">It's</a>  something that we, and by we, I mean as a city, not as a council, can't seem to fund and expand resources for that department nearly fast enough at the rate that we know there's a clear need for and that residents are on a daily basis observing. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2573.524s">the</a>  need for. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2574.744s">Obviously,</a>  rules are not self-enforcing. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2576.605s">I</a>  think that these suggestions are really good to try to nip in the bud the problem of Airbnbs and things like them proliferating in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2585.388s">And</a>  then we need an expanded code enforcement office to be following up on problems like these and all of the many other problems from potholes to obstructed sidewalks to overgrowth that residents are reporting every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2600.774s">in</a>  our community, and I really do regret and resent that when we exist at these substandard staffing and resource levels for basic city functions, it means that residents have to be code enforcement officers, and I really don't think that's fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2614.041s">I</a>  don't think community members should have to be that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2616.122s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2617.142s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2617.903s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2620.144s">Madam</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2621.965s">I</a>  think it's also very important to point out that this is 100% an enforcement issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2626.799s">And</a>  we do have the controls in place and it's a matter of the administration taking steps that are necessary to ensure that neighborhoods are protected. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2634.681s">So</a>  that's number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2636.101s">And</a>  number two, we also have to think about what's prompting residents in this community to move towards not being landlords and instead being Airbnb operators. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2646.184s">And</a>  some of it has to do with the discussion, I think, about policies that might go into effect in this community in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2652.465s">Some</a>  of it has to do with the fact that there's a lot of strong tenant rights laws <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2656.425s">And</a>  landlords feel like sometimes they're at a disadvantage when they go in to pursue non payment or rent issues and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2663.354s">So</a>  policy that we create also impacts these trends in housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2669.907s">So</a>  it's important for us to look at the big picture as we move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2672.709s">But</a>  I can certainly agree with all my council colleagues and saying that this is 100% enforcement issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2676.931s">And</a>  it's something that needs to be handled the forthright. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2680.713s">Ultimately,</a>  you know, it's about protecting the neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2682.934s">And</a>  right now we're not doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2684.094s">And</a>  that's something we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2685.095s">So</a>  I thank the council for bringing the issue forward.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2688.937s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2691.018s">Any</a>  further discussion from the council at this time? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2696.14s">Any</a>  members of the public wish to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2700.25s">So</a>  on the motion of, I mean, we'll take public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2702.992s">So</a>  on the motion of vice president affairs, seconded by councilor Collins, Mr. Calderon.</p>

highlighted serious violations of the city's short-term rental code at this location, prompting the need for a thorough examination. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2760.652s">Key</a>  points of concern, I want to emphasize that I have taken proactive measures to address this situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2765.546s">I</a>  personally reached out to Medford Code Enforcement Department to report these violations. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2769.689s">See</a>  click issue ID 15172926. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2773.132s">In</a>  response, they promptly conducted an onsite inspection and acknowledged that the apparent violations by issuing an official violation letter to the property owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2781.419s">However,</a>  despite these actions, the property continues to function as an apparent illegal lodging establishment. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2787.023s">At</a>  present, the property remains occupied by a substantial number of guests and is fully booked for the upcoming year. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2793.126s">operational</a>  practices and consequences. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2794.907s">Based</a>  on my investigation, it appears that 66 Lyman Ave is operating in a manner resembling an unauthorized boarding house. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2801.73s">The</a>  proprietors, who reside in Winchester, have been renting individual bedrooms through Airbnb since 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2806.952s">The</a>  operational model has resulted in a continuous influx of approximately six new guests each week for over two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2813.015s">The</a>  practice raises serious concerns about security and potential health hazards for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2817.543s">Security</a>  risks in our neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2818.744s">Beyond</a>  potential code violations, the security risks associated with operating in a legal hotel in a quiet suburban neighborhood are significant. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2825.37s">The</a>  constant turnover of unfamiliar individuals entering and exiting the premises disrupts the tranquility of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2831.209s">The</a>  dynamic presents security concerns that extend beyond the property itself, affecting neighboring houses and streets, the heightened traffic flow, possible disturbances, and the unfamiliarity of temporary occupancy with local safety protocols amplifies these concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2844.415s">Identifying</a>  regulatory barriers, digital evidence listed in CCLX fix report shows that there are several violations of the short-term rental zoning regulations at 66 Lyman Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2854.12s">It</a>  is crucial to investigate potential factors impeding compliance. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2857.381s">Three</a>  key areas of concern include <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2860.074s">Operator's</a>  primary residence requirement is a requirement that a short-term rental property serves as the operator's primary residence appears to be compromised as evidenced by the absence of the owner slash operator and the transportation of supplies from an external location. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2874.44s">Sole</a>  renter party mandate, the practice of renting multiple separate bedrooms of distinct groups as indicated by multiple listings for different bedrooms concurrently raises concerns about compliance with the single party rental mandate and guest count limitation. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2886.985s">The</a>  observed operational activity prompts questions <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2889.557s">about</a>  adherence to the stipulated guest limits for short-term rentals. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2893.338s">Impact</a>  on local rental dynamics. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2895.299s">In</a>  addition to potential regulatory infractions, there are implications for our local rental dynamics. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2899.8s">Short-term</a>  rental practices have led to substantial disparities in rental rates, while traditional year-long lease for comparable property rents for approximately 3,500 per month, the same property on Airbnb commands around 6,000 per month. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2912.904s">This</a>  trend distorts the local rental market, rendering long-term leases less accessible for residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2918.632s">preservation</a>  of our community's well-being. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2920.233s">As</a>  these complexities unfold, it is vital to address the situation promptly. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2923.975s">Upholding</a>  established regulations and safeguarding our community's well-being are paramount. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2928.498s">I</a>  urge you to enforce the new short-term rental codes for 66 Lyman Ave and all other illegal short-term rentals in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2936.483s">Your</a>  thoughtful consideration is highly valued, and I am confident that your appropriate measures will be taken to address this matter in alignment with existing regulations and the best interests of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2945.308s">Sincerely,</a>  Elliot Jockelson, 60 Marshall Street, Medford. <a

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3074.439s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Elliot Jokelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3076.421s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3076.961s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3078.323s">That's</a>  embarrassing.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3078.963s">And</a>  if I could just, I just do want to reiterate Councilor Knight's point, which I tried to make clear in my resolution just prior to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3088.398s">Two</a>  things are clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3089.119s">I've</a>  talked I've been working with Elliot talking to code enforcement about this I've been hearing from other folks about You know different issues code enforcement goes out when they hear about it, but they Basically the way we're doing code enforcement city generally in the way that it's structured is not what it needs to be you know essentially <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3109.005s">The</a>  building departments code enforcement, and they're more focused on things like this and building inspection.</p>

    <p>[Elliot Jokelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3113.508s">Dennis</a>  came straight and they came straight out. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3115.629s">Yeah,</a>  they looked at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3116.59s">They</a>  were professional. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3117.651s">It</a>  wasn't them. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3118.151s">It's</a>  just they don't have the teeth. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3120.893s">Exactly</a>  the staff.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3121.813s">And</a>  yeah, and that's what I'm that's what I'm getting at. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3123.674s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3123.935s">Like</a>  they're doing great. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3124.915s">They're</a>  doing an awesome job. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3125.996s">I'm</a>  talking to them directly about what they need. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3128.538s">And</a>  you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3130.259s">essentially,</a>  you know, they've been doing, there should be a code enforcement officer at DPW looking at stuff in the public way. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3136.24s">The</a>  building department's been covering for that for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3139.021s">I</a>  think we need to have a serious discussion about inspectional services and code enforcement in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3143.682s">What's</a>  the resource level? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3144.942s">How</a>  are they collaborating? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3146.002s">Which</a>  departments are doing each job? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3147.442s">Because</a>  clearly, on this issue, I think we're about to hear another major issue about overgrowth and trash and issues in <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3156.013s">on</a>  Emory Street tonight, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3158.535s">Clearly</a>  they don't have the resources and the support they need. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3161.396s">The</a>  flip side of that is we can advocate, we pass the zoning ordinance, we communicate when we can, when we hear from a resident or we hear from code enforcement, we try to make those links. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3171.342s">Actually</a>  funding or making a structural change to how we do inspectional services, only the mayor has the power to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3178.647s">Actually</a>  saying, hey, code enforcement, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3181.168s">You</a>  know, we need to prioritize creating an Airbnb liaison, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3185.05s">Only</a>  the mayor can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3186.131s">So</a>  does the mayor watch this?</p>

    <p>[Elliot Jokelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3188.072s">I</a>  don't know if the mayor is watching please shut all these Airbnbs down immediately because I'm just curious like about 66 Lyman Well, I mean, thank you for having me here. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3198.297s">What's</a>  the next step? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3199.157s">Like</a>  I had the police out here today. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3200.718s">There's</a>  three more cars coming tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3202.939s">There's</a>  a <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3204.183s">18</a>  more cars coming next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3207.387s">That's</a>  part of the reason why I came here because I've spoken to code enforcement, I've spoken to the city council now. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3215.214s">I'm</a>  still unclear what the process is for getting this shut down. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3218.537s">I'm</a>  in the dark and every day I'm looking outside my kitchen window and I'm seeing three new cars blow up.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3223.846s">Right,</a>  and that's kind of why I'm making the statement I'm making is we've now put a resolution on, our resolutions generally get a response from the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3232.108s">The</a>  point of this resolution is to say, hey, we need to make this a priority, it's our request, please respond and tell us when and how you're going to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3239.97s">Right</a>  now, all I can do is we can have another email or phone conversation with Dennis or Mike and we can- I'm gonna email the mayor next, but I'm gonna keep watching and annoying people until this house is shut down.</p>

    <p>[Elliot Jokelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3250.572s">I'm</a>  not going away, I'm the- <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3253.491s">the</a>  like miser of Marshall Street or whatever.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3255.733s">I</a>  don't know what you want to call it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3257.054s">The</a>  campsite was shut down, so there is precedence.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3259.597s">Yes,</a>  exactly. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3261.038s">And</a>  so, you know, that's what I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3263.04s">I</a>  want to be clear that we have our eyes on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3265.021s">We've</a>  been working on this legislatively. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3267.162s">We're</a>  going to be pushing for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3268.883s">It's</a>  a partnership in a two-way street in terms of we can make the request, but the action has to come from the office of the mayor, because that's who runs enforcement and who supervises the staff of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3278.87s">So-</a>  Well, now that I've spoken to you, I will now go and try and pursue it there. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3283.232s">Yeah,</a>  and I'm happy to help on that direction too. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3286.194s">I</a>  would love to have a conversation with the council and the mayor and code enforcement about what should inspectional services look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3293.993s">in</a>  the city as well.</p>

    <p>[Elliot Jokelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3294.673s">It's</a>  so easy to shut it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3296.173s">You</a>  could change the entire city in a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3298.494s">Yeah,</a>  if you had the right. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3299.694s">Anyway,</a>  thank you so much.</p>

    <p>[Elliot Jokelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3373.291s">any</a>  precedent for like a, like a, like citizen task force that helps them? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3379.394s">I</a>  mean, sure, there's a lot of people that will be interested.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3381.295s">Well,</a>  they don't have a citizen task, but doesn't have legal authority.</p>

    <p>[Elliot Jokelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3384.597s">But</a>  I mean, I mean, other than other than providing information to them in a certain way, where they can look at it and say, Okay, this is an Airbnb house, and they don't have to spend any time on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3392.261s">Other</a>  than that, you know, something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3393.562s">I</a>  don't know.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3394.182s">I</a>  mean, yes, I say, you know, as fast as you bring it to our attention, you call me or you call councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3399.445s">Oh,</a>  I'll <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3401.246s">I'll</a>  call in as fast as you give them to me.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3403.387s">Point</a>  of information, Madam Mayor, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3407.909s">I</a>  think what you're doing is unbelievable. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3411.071s">What</a>  you're doing right now is a good example for the rest of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3414.352s">We</a>  don't have to have a task force, just people caring about the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3417.114s">We're</a>  going to hear that about, you know, Emory Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3419.995s">It's</a>  people that are reaching out to us that unfortunately we don't have the court enforcement department we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3425.317s">I</a>  agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3426.698s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3428.179s">I</a>  said, you know, I'm around during the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3430.341s">You</a>  call me, I'll come and help you.</p>

    <p>[Elliot Jokelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3431.902s">I</a>  appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3432.743s">But</a>  one of the things I'm only here 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3434.644s">One</a>  of the things that really frustrates me about the city is I don't want to have to call one person. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3438.107s">I</a>  want to thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3439.007s">I</a>  want to like, where do I go online to make the report? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3442.23s">Who</a>  do I speak to in three weeks when it doesn't get done? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3444.392s">And</a>  then what are the consequences? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3446.553s">I</a>  don't want to have to, I've been on this and thank you so much for offering that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3449.756s">But</a>  I've been on it for like two years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3451.717s">I</a>  don't have any more time. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3452.978s">I</a>  know, you get a job, you get a job. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3455.099s">And</a>  I'm saying that to you guys, you guys spent so much time for little rewards. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3458.881s">So</a>  I appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3460.462s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3461.123s">And</a>  I just want to add, I think on this specific one, you found the answer, which is we should just be saying directly to the company, you have to remove the listing.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3466.826s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3467.086s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3467.346s">And</a>  that, that, that strips out the entire process. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3470.088s">And</a>  then, you know, you have the people with the authority to make that from the city side who have the legal authority to have that enforcement happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3478.633s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3480.342s">And</a>  sometimes it takes a little push from us. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3482.524s">Like</a>  I say, I went up to Emory Street, I took some pictures, I sent them over to the DPW and the expression. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3487.989s">I</a>  mean, and we'll talk about that later, but sometimes it takes that little extra push from somebody to get up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3493.493s">So</a>  if you got something, please, my number's listed, call, I'm gonna say I'm around all day long. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3499.078s">I</a>  appreciate that, thank you very much.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3502.061s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3504.059s">This</a>  is public participation, and I see some folks online with hands up, and I know folks want to speak in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3508.944s">So</a>  I'm going to go to Eunice on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3511.406s">I</a>  will ask you to unmute. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3514.228s">And</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3514.669s">Hi,</a>  good evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3516.831s">Thank</a>  you very much for allowing me to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3519.713s">So</a>  my question is this.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3520.734s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please?</p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3523.097s">Oh,</a>  I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3523.897s">Eunice</a>  Browne, Greenleaf Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3527.522s">I</a>  have two houses on my street, two families that are getting ready to close with new owners this month. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3537.829s">And</a>  particularly the one next door to me, but the other one is four houses up. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3542.952s">I'm</a>  very fearful of what's to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3546.674s">I</a>  don't know what their intentions are, but if their intentions are to run an Airbnb, and they've bought the property specifically for that purpose, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3558.783s">How</a>  are we nipping these in the bud? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3561.545s">If</a>  the people next door to me thought, well, I'll buy this two-family, I'll turn it into an Airbnb, hey, I've got a gold mine here. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3572.754s">First</a>  of all, they can't do this, from what I understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3576.197s">They</a>  can't just turn this two-family into a hotel, so to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3582.376s">Do</a>  they know that they can't do this? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3584.117s">Do</a>  they know that they have to go and register? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3586.137s">Or</a>  are you folks on the city side just counting on the fact that a couple of months in, I'm going to see a rotating cast of characters in here in different cars where Greenleaf's parking is already tight enough, as I'm sure you all know, and a rotating cast of characters. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3609.123s">Is</a>  there any way to proactively <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3611.442s">know,</a>  before these people do this, tell them that they can't do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3617.186s">And</a>  then maybe they'll go look elsewhere.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3618.787s">I</a>  guess we did just recently passed the housing stability notification ordinance, which is about providing renters with information they need to know about renting in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3629.433s">So</a>  I'm sure there's something we could explore as far as providing new owners information like this that lets them know about regulations as far as short term rentals, directing them to this <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3641.26s">zoning</a>  code, something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3642.98s">Councilor</a>  Tseng?</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3643.701s">And</a>  it might be helpful to do more for the city to do more outreach to realtors and to folks who are helping sell the properties to let them know that they should inform their clients that that use is off the table.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3661.205s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3662.266s">Councilor</a>  Collins?</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3664.056s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell, and I appreciate this bringing forward because it's, you know, essentially an example of what we've been talking about is what can we do to make it so these problems aren't happening in the first place. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3673.878s">And</a>  I think the housing stability notification ordinance is a good example because that's using our existing city communication channels just to distribute what is information that's already existing rules that already exist, you know, using an existing communication channel. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3689.762s">I</a>  think that that paired with having a liaison to <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3692.947s">you</a>  know, Airbnb or a similar company, these are ways of saying, hey, before anybody starts doing anything that you may not know in good faith that you shouldn't be doing, here's how things work in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3702.674s">That</a>  paired with more robust enforcement, I think that that's what we should be rolling out for every, you know, all of these frequent flyer city problems that we know we see all the time.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3711.02s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3711.66s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3712.18s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3713.942s">Madam</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3715.803s">I</a>  look at this in a couple of different ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3718.905s">The</a>  first of which is, you know, all of this, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3722.29s">getting</a>  involved between someone trying to sell a house and someone trying to buy a house and the regulations and restrictions that surround it is part of the due diligence process when you're purchasing a home. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3734.222s">or</a>  when you're purchasing a piece of property. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3736.643s">And</a>  I know that that's a process that's heavily regulated as it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3742.505s">I</a>  think we better be very careful in how far we're going to be going in performing the due diligence for these private landowners conducting private land transactions. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3753.23s">So,</a>  with that being said, you know, I can certainly see the issue going on with the lack of enforcement of BMPs in the community, the strict code that we've established that would provide you only 90 days a year for rental. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3765.678s">But</a>  at the end of the day, you know, I think that there has to be a spot where government doesn't get so involved in people's lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3771.322s">So,</a>  we have to draw our line somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3772.823s">And</a>  I think that when that line is doing the due diligence for <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3778.638s">potential</a>  homebuyers. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3780.679s">It</a>  just doesn't really fall within the scope of what a government service is. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3784.5s">And</a>  I think that at the end of the day, we'd be providing far too much energy and effort and performing an exercise that's not going to reap great results. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3792.903s">I</a>  think we'd be much better off putting our energy, efforts, and time into enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3798.624s">So</a>  that's where I stand on this matter, but thank you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3800.325s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3803.366s">Going</a>  to Sneha on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3805.707s">I</a>  will unmute you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3811.621s">and</a>  name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Sneha]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3813.542s">Hi,</a>  Deb. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3814.222s">This</a>  is Sneha. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3815.683s">My</a>  address is 108 Medford Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3819.685s">I</a>  understand this discussion is rightly so about enforcement, but I just wanted to introduce a note of skepticism in that regard because honestly, just hearing about neighbors sort of keeping an eye on the number plates coming in and who's coming in, who's coming out and having this, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3840.631s">It</a>  almost sounds like a kind of vigilantism, which is very terrifying to me, frankly speaking, because I think as much as we care about going by the book and making sure homeowners don't exploit certain loopholes in the law, we should also be careful about not building up a resistance to any kind of outsider as a sentiment coming into the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3867.191s">So</a>  I just wanted to have that on the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3870.622s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3872.524s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3872.844s">Is</a>  there anyone else who would like to speak for public participation at this time? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3878.91s">Please</a>  come up to the mic. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3882.012s">And</a>  I know we have multiple folks for public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3884.094s">We</a>  still have an agenda that folks are here for as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3886.296s">So</a>  I will be enforcing the council rules, five minutes each for public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3892.161s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Maryanne Adduci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3897.284s">Yep,</a>  it's on, there you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3898.344s">Hi,</a>  Mary Anna Ducey, 2 North Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3901.665s">I'm</a>  here tonight because I wanted to call attention to the fact, you all know that Walkland Court is being redeveloped. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3910.588s">They</a>  have had meetings for the community, but the community doesn't feel as though our voices are being heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3920.313s">So</a>  in talking to the residents in the neighborhood, I decided that maybe we should do a petition to see what gauged the sentiment of the community, which I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3931.786s">And</a>  I'm going to give you a copy tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3934.189s">I'm</a>  going to also present this tomorrow night because the Community Development Board is going to have a meeting on the zoning there. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3941.357s">Now,</a>  basically, the neighborhood around Walkley Court is not opposed to rebuilding, renovating, upgrading, or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3950.602s">It's</a>  the size and the scale that they're proposing there. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3954.804s">They're</a>  cramming, we feel, too many people in too small an area, and they're putting six-story buildings in a residential neighborhood besides single-family homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3966.428s">So</a>  I have all the issues that the residents are concerned about in the petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3973.75s">And</a>  for your information, there's very strong, and I mean very strong opposition to this, of the design, not the fact that they're going to redevelop the community, but it's to the... I'd like to get the names on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3990.775s">And</a>  this is for the clerks, for the permanent. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3996.255s">I</a>  have collected 1,131 signatures opposing the current design. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4004.182s">99%</a>  of the people that I've approached signed. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4007.605s">They</a>  don't know anything about this, most of them, so I showed them a copy of the design that's being proposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4015.292s">I</a>  have to educate everybody on what's going on there because they've only notified people about the change within 400 feet of the complex. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4024.113s">Now,</a>  everybody's touting the fact that it's gonna be good for the housing authority and they're gonna add this, but what is it doing to the neighborhood? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4035.163s">There</a>  has to be some compromise here. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4037.565s">Yes,</a>  we'll be supportive of whatever they wanna do there, but within reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4043.53s">They</a>  have to consider the neighborhood and how it's gonna affect the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4048.16s">So</a>  all the points that have been raised are in the handout that I gave you tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4054.625s">And</a>  the copy of the permanent sign petition is gonna be filed with the clerk's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4060.59s">Tomorrow</a>  night at the 6.30, well actually during the day tomorrow, I'm going to the community development office and give them their copy. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4067.375s">But</a>  since the city council was meeting tonight, I thought you should have your copy tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4071.879s">So</a>  I'd be happy to answer any questions if you people have any. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4078.243s">but</a>  I want you to know that the community needs some help in mediating what the housing authority wants to do and what is good for the residents of the city of Medford.</p>

    <p>[Maryanne Adduci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4106.363s">Well,</a>  the points that I bring out in the letter should help you start that conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4112.107s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4112.847s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4115.949s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4116.309s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4119.151s">Going</a>  to Councilor Knight, unless your hand is still up.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4199.635s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4200.776s">And</a>  we have someone else for public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4204.278s">I</a>  think you're <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4206.069s">We're</a>  good through every, if you wanna come up, we're good for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4208.991s">We</a>  can also go back to public participation at the end if you wanna get through everything, but okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4213.555s">Did</a>  you have something else? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4215.516s">Elliot.</a> </p>

    <p>[Elliot Jokelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4218.538s">I</a>  wanna support my neighbor over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4220.42s">She's</a>  fantastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4221.461s">She</a>  goes around with petitions and she went around for the bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4225.584s">And</a>  I live on Marshall Street, which is a block away from <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4229.795s">where</a>  they're proposing a new road that will lead into all these six-story apartment buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4236.039s">And</a>  I've been following the issue closely, and I've been surprised when I checked to see what the requirements were for who they had to speak with. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4245.544s">It</a>  was just houses that touched the property, which is like six houses. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4250.287s">And</a>  they're proposing to open up a road with several six-story buildings onto a street that they don't repair. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4259.005s">It's</a>  one six-story building. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4262.296s">Sorry,</a>  one six-story building. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4264.543s">It's</a>  two six-story buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4266.892s">Is</a>  it not, Zach?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4267.833s">I</a>  believe it's one large six-story building and then smaller outbuilding.</p>

    <p>[Elliot Jokelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4273.236s">I'm</a>  actually in favor of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4274.537s">I</a>  do think it's a little large. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4275.858s">But</a>  if you're opening the road onto a street, adding all those people, and you don't ever fix a street for 10 years, maybe you want to go down the street and talk to every house on the street and see how they feel about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4288.446s">There's</a>  going to be a lot more traffic there, that's for sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4290.748s">That's</a>  all I wanted to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4291.848s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Matthew Page-Lieberman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4320.595s">I'm</a>  speaking on behalf of, in the last term, it looked like there was a lot of aversion to moving on it, particularly by the president. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4327.18s">It</a>  seemed like there were mothballing, and I'm glad to see that there'll be movement on it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4332.504s">Oh,</a>  sorry about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4333.424s">I</a>  had a big, quick walk over here, but there's another issue about this whole Airbnb. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4339.909s">I've</a>  watched these meetings long enough, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4342.599s">To</a>  hear Councilors different different instances of the council and members here just target lots of groups there was years ago developers were targeted and then some of the same Councilors changed their minds and then Targeted the Historical Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4358.758s">I've</a>  heard masseuses get attacked here. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4361.781s">I've</a>  heard <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4363.308s">I've</a>  heard there's this threat about Oasis and the clientele, and now it's people that are in Airbnbs, and you hear it again and again and again. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4370.83s">I</a>  know part of it is this game, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4372.911s">We</a>  got to target somebody this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4375.332s">But</a>  I'm just kind of trying to speak that there are many people who don't speak, but there are us out in the community, and we see what's going on when yet another group is targeted. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4385.115s">But</a>  uh-oh, they might be having some fun, and I'm not. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4388.016s">I'm</a>  miserable, I'm pissed off, and I want to stop them from having some fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4391.903s">So,</a>  you know, last month I had a bilateral Ernie operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4397.469s">And</a>  my mother came, she's a retired nurse, she came from Florida to help me out and help me through the recuperation. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4402.554s">The</a>  recuperation is still going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4404.436s">We</a>  really want to stay here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4406.618s">We</a>  really did want to. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4407.459s">And</a>  some people don't know how to do searches on Airbnb, and they actually think that there are thousands of Airbnb units in the city, but they're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4414.873s">But</a>  we were able to find one in Malden. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4417.375s">All</a>  we were looking for was two units and a kitchen. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4420.436s">And</a>  we simply could not find that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4422.097s">This</a>  was an actual need. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4423.318s">This</a>  isn't like some party. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4425.419s">And</a>  it wasn't here in the city where I wanted to stay in my own city during my creation. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4429.902s">It</a>  was in Malden. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4431.243s">And</a>  I think we may want to reflect upon that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4433.304s">There</a>  are many people that use Airbnb besides what we imagine are troublemakers partying. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4439.168s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4449.578s">Hang</a>  on, Mr. Castagnetti. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4450.879s">Advice</a>  isn't fair.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4451.699s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4452.22s">I</a>  wanna acknowledge what Mr. Paige Lieberman just said. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4455.622s">I</a>  think it's not targeting people who use Airbnb. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4460.124s">I</a>  think there's obviously cases and situations where there's need for people to have short-term accommodations. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4465.908s">I</a>  think it's the question of, historically, until these app companies came in and said, oh, we're gonna make a premium off of people's homes, renting them out, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4476.257s">people</a>  stayed at hotels, which have regulations, they have specific security requirements, taxation requirements, there is a suites, I think it's a town place suites or some Marriott suites in Medford that has a kitchen and some bedrooms in it, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4489.664s">Like,</a>  but while there are certainly reasonable and valid use cases, I think when you have a <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4497.142s">there</a>  are people renting single family homes for $1,000 a night. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4500.824s">If</a>  you can make $360,000 a year, and maybe you won't rent it out every night, but say you rent it out half the nights, you can make $180,000 a year, why would you ever rent it long-term to a long-term tenant? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4512.572s">You</a>  just wouldn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4514.693s">I</a>  mean, I wouldn't do that, but if you're just buying property to speculate on and seek profit motive, if you can make $180,000 a year versus $40,000 a year, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4523.632s">you</a>  know, someone who has that profit motive or chooses to speculate on the land and housing in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4528.891s">since</a>  we don't regulate it, they're gonna do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4530.793s">And</a>  I just think that's, it's not about targeting the people who use Airbnbs, it's targeting the people who are buying housing and land in the city and turning it into micro hotels in neighborhoods that are unregulated because they can make an extra $100,000 a year off of land that should be used for people to live here, to live here. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4551.21s">And</a>  that's really more where I'm coming from on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4553.291s">I'm</a>  not one to, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4556.772s">Be</a>  mad that people are having fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4558.332s">I</a>  like having fun too. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4560.093s">So</a>  I just don't think that the landlord making $100,000 a year in profit by taking a housing unit away from a family who wants to live here should be able to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4569.115s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4577.698s">Hello,</a>  President Andrew Castagnetti, Medford, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4582.839s">I</a>  don't know much about this Airbnb business. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4586.815s">However,</a>  I feel for Mr. Elliot Jockelson from Marshall street and all his neighbors who have to deal with all these different vehicles, maybe on a nightly basis, they should not be allowed to rent out a home, especially an absentee landlord. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4606.022s">Um,</a>  and they rented it as a hotel. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4608.323s">That</a>  doesn't make any sense to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4610.864s">And</a>  this is unjust to the, to the people that live in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4616.135s">so</a>  uh I mean for lack of a better word um if one of your councils live next door to one of these hotels on a daily basis in a house it would really for lack of better english it would really suck plain english hopefully you have federal or state or local laws or local ordinances that you can uphold and have teeth because this should not go on it's not just <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4645.385s">Marshall</a>  Street's problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4647.327s">I'm</a>  sure there's many locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4649.308s">Thank</a>  you for listening.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4651.49s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4652.611s">On</a>  that point, Madam President.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4654.573s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4656.454s">I</a>  think it's important to point out that we probably do have one of the strongest short-term rental ordinances in the region. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4663.92s">But</a>  again, it's an issue about enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4666.763s">To</a>  Mr. Castagnetti's question, this has been <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4671.821s">reviewed</a>  at the state level extensively, and it's been determined that local municipalities can't ban them. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4678.164s">But</a>  what we can do is regulate them, but we can regulate them only to a certain extent. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4682.466s">And</a>  we've utilized our legislative power to do that to the fullest. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4686.728s">The</a>  question now is, can the administration put the teeth that we gave them to good use, and be sure that our ordinance is enforced to the level that the taxpayers deserve?</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4701.325s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4701.966s">Is</a>  there anyone else for public participation at this time? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4707.651s">Moving</a>  to 23-393 offered by Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4711.615s">Be</a>  it resolved that the Medford City Council have the T Medford Disability Commission Parking Commission address the issue with the lack of handicapped parking at the Tufts T Station. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4720.564s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4721.685s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4722.485s">This</a>  is something <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4724.957s">I</a>  was brought to my attention by a young lady sitting in the audience there who made me aware that we have this brand new T stop and we have no handicapped parking there. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4735.753s">I</a>  just assumed that there was parking and after she brought it to my attention, I went up there, I looked. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4741.608s">And</a>  I see none. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4742.83s">I</a>  mean, we have our mayor who's the vice chairman of the Tea Advisory Board. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4749.016s">I</a>  would hope that the mayor will be on top of this and have spots put up there immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4754.481s">And</a>  the other issue is all the tea workers park their cars there with the little tea badge in there, and our parking commission doesn't tag them. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4764.372s">It</a>  doesn't work. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4765.813s">Parking's</a>  at a minimum at the best up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4769.176s">T</a>  employees should find their own place to park or take the T to work, like everyone else. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4774.24s">And</a>  I say, I think the young lady may want to talk, but I say, I would hope that the disability director and the mayor, who's vice chair of the committee, immediately act on this, get some spots there immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4785.79s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4786.63s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4787.251s">Would</a>  you like to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4789.172s">Just</a>  name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Driscoll]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4792.708s">My</a>  name is Anne Driscoll. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4794.268s">I</a>  live at 77 Quincy Street in Medford, and it was worth coming just to hear Mr. Caraviello call me a young woman. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4802.57s">So</a>  there is a population being underserved by not having parking spaces at the Medford Tufts station, and that's the handicapped and the elderly. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4813.072s">You</a>  may be aware that in the United States, 13.67 of the people are disabled, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4823.049s">which</a>  is a more proper term. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4824.169s">Handicap</a>  means hand in your cap. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4825.95s">It's</a>  an outdated, but it's still on the signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4830.23s">That's</a>  an underestimation because to have a handicap, a placard for your car, you get a permanent placard or a temporary one. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4841.772s">A</a>  permanent placard is for those who cannot walk 200 feet without needing to sit down. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4848.794s">Those</a>  with heart conditions, elderly, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4851.249s">A</a>  temporary is for those people that are disabled for more than two months, broken ankle, broken leg, perhaps cancer treatment. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4861.434s">And</a>  this is a segment of the population that's being very underserved. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4865.996s">And</a>  I have been to the mayor and had... On May 12th, 2022, I've been bounced from department to department. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4876.641s">No</a>  action has been taken until Mr. Caraviello graciously <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4881.3s">met</a>  with me last Friday, and we discussed that and several other issues in which we are underserving our disability population. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4889.306s">I</a>  am 79 years old, so I love being called the young one, a young lady, and we bought our first house in Medford at age 35, then had a rental unit in addition to family, and now we're into a downsized in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4904.778s">So</a>  we're long-term Medford residents, and it's now in our older years, with, of course, my disabilities, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4911.564s">that</a>  we need the services that would support us to make this a livable city for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4920.648s">And</a>  I've lived in the Tufts Hillside area. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4923.329s">So</a>  I know the students and they can be daunting, but Tufts has always worked very well with the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4934.293s">And</a>  when we call, they break up the 200 people parties. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4937.835s">So</a>  Tufts, the fellow from Marshall Street <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4941.3s">I</a>  have to say I sympathize with him because I recognize that overpopulation can really be a threat. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4947.305s">And</a>  that's why we moved five minutes away to Quincy Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4951.729s">So</a>  I think to be fair and to serve the entire population, we need not just to have one little handicapped parking spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4960.917s">We</a>  need to have a number because there are those people that have caretakers and they're bringing people. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4966.922s">And</a>  I have been in a wheelchair and I have been <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4970.12s">on</a>  crutches, and I have been using a walker. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4972.862s">And</a>  to have an easy way to get to a doctor is important, it's critical. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4981.649s">And</a>  for heaven's sakes, our elderly and our disabled might like to just go sit on the Boston Common and enjoy the weather. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4989.496s">Thank</a>  you for hearing me. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4991.317s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4992.618s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4995.489s">I</a>  think most of us were there at that grand opening of the T with much fanfare. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5000.372s">The</a>  governor was there and everybody was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5001.773s">And</a>  I don't know how an issue of handicap parking got overlooked on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5006.935s">So</a>  I would say our mayor is the vice chair of the T Advisory Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5011.437s">I</a>  would hope that, I don't know why this wasn't acted on sooner was this woman put it in in May, but now September. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5021.142s">Oh,</a>  I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5022.363s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5022.863s">I</a>  apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5023.304s">May</a>  of last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5024.993s">It's</a>  been over a year, and it's something that should have been rectified immediately.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5030.9s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5039.947s">Um,</a>  it's, I live a block away from Medford Tufts and, you know, honestly, it's, it's not a hard solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5047.472s">There's,</a>  there's space on Boston Ave where you can put in handicap parking and there are garages in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5053.756s">There's</a>  a Tufts garage where people can, people who don't need that proximity can park at. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5058.899s">Um,</a>  and so I would really hope that, um, the administration really work to, to make it, I, I just don't know how this got overlooked as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5069.025s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5070.762s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5072.924s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5073.664s">I</a>  also just want to say thank you, Mr. Scullin, for working with Councilor Caraviello to raise this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5079.228s">I'm</a>  sorry that it's taken you such a long time and been bounced from department to department to try to give voice to this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5086.953s">You</a>  speak very movingly about the need to, as a city and as working with our state agencies, to keep doing a better job of, you know, not always just catering to the average user, but centering people who are disabled, either temporarily or permanently, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5102.561s">All</a>  types of people need to get on the T, and this T station was built for all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5105.905s">So</a>  thank you for bringing this forward, and I'm sure that we're all going to stay on it to make sure that there are disabled parking spaces near this T station. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5112.132s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5112.93s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5113.53s">Vice</a>  President Bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5114.59s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5115.771s">Thank</a>  you, Anne, for coming down and bringing this forward and for working with Councilor Caraviello on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5120.392s">I</a>  just want to propose an amendment to just add the traffic commission, because I believe the parking on Boston Ave is city-owned, so it would be the jurisdiction of the traffic commission, and a petition could go before them soon, and they could put the markings and signs out. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5136.776s">I</a>  mean, it would be under their authority to put that out, so.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5139.537s">Councilor</a>  Bears, if you drive by there, you'll see 8 to 10 cars <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5144.081s">that</a>  are parked there in our parking spots.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5147.663s">Yeah,</a>  I've seen that, and they're not paying.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5149.424s">With</a>  the T badges, and our parking department just ignores it.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5154.687s">And</a>  the reason I just want to add the Traffic Commission is because there's the two things here. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5158.329s">One</a>  is the Traffic Commission could mark those as handicapped spots at their next meeting, changing enforcement and requiring enforcement that, you know, we've had a lot of discussions about that tonight, haven't we?</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5189.394s">a</a>  few different issues when it comes to our handicapped community and the lack of respect, whether they were having a city event and they're blocking handicap ramps or issues like what we're hearing tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5204.307s">I</a>  think that, I know that the, I know that Neil Osborne used to have the position. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5217.409s">is</a>  so frank. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5218.349s">Has</a>  anybody can we actually make a motion to send that to Francis as well? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5222.852s">So</a>  I think this is an issue to with the Disability Act that it's not just the T issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5228.955s">It's</a>  just not, you know, a situation with with, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5234.238s">you</a>  know, Todd Blake, but this is also something that legally that the city has to get involved in, and we can send, you know, our enforcement agency to look at that as soon as possible to see if something could be remedied sooner rather than later, because if we wait for the T, they'll be building a blue line going through Metro. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5256.905s">So</a>  if we could do that, I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5260.326s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Driscoll]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5261.787s">The</a>  American Disability Act does require 20% parking for services for people that will need it that are disabled.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5270.632s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5272.413s">And</a>  to echo my fellow Councilors, thank you, Councilor Caraviello, for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5275.555s">Thank</a>  you, Anne, for coming out for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5276.816s">And</a>  I appreciate just the background facts as well, because I think something that I've heard in one of these meetings that stuck with me is it's something that Americans with Disabilities is the largest minority group in the country, and it's the only minority group that you can join at any time. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5290.563s">So</a>  it's something that it's not a niche issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5292.685s">It's</a>  something that affects every single one of us and every single one of us should be focused on. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5296.069s">So</a>  I really appreciate you coming here tonight and reminding us once more of all the things that we may not see that are really impacting people's lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5303.677s">So</a>  hopefully we can get this fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5306.6s">Going</a>  to Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5309.265s">Madam</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5310.606s">I</a>  think moving forward as we go through our zoning reform, this is something we also might want to take a look at where the ADA requires a minimum of 20%. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5317.89s">I</a>  don't think there's anything that could prevent us from requiring more than that, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5323.054s">Number</a>  two, as we've established policies in this community as a council through zoning reform that's reduced <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5329.077s">the</a>  parking minimums in certain developments with that obviously would come a reduction in the number of parking for handicapped blackout holders. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5336.62s">So</a>  again, you know, an unintended consequence of policy change. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5340.321s">So</a>  it's something that needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5341.602s">And</a>  I think a good way to approach that might be through our next round of zoning codification and maybe increasing the minimum number of parking spots that would be required or reserved for our disabled residents here in the community and elsewhere that are visiting our community.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5357.145s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5358.526s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Caraviello, as amended by Vice-Mayor Bears and Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Tseng, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5377.377s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5377.817s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5378.197s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5387.011s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5388.432s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5388.672s">I</a>  mean, if earners here and then I get the motion passes to 3.400 offered by Vice Affairs, whereas thousands of civil code violations are going on address each year due to underfunding and misallocation of city staffing resources for enforcement and inspections. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5402.803s">Now,</a>  therefore, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the city administration provide a plan to increase civil code enforcement and inspection services staffing, either with new funding <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5411.485s">or</a>  by reallocating funding within or between the city's enforcement departments to match need, be it further resolve the city administration report on efforts to address numerous major code enforcement violations in the hillside neighborhood.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5423.134s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5423.935s">I</a>  think this has kind of become the theme of the night, so I'm happy to just kind of quickly move through this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5428.918s">We</a>  can move to the specific resolution that Councilor Caraviello filed. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5432.601s">But</a>  really, the intent here is just to say that we need to have a discussion about code enforcement and inspectional services in the city, getting them the resources they need, putting that under the correct structure, because there's just tons of civil code violations happening all the time that are, you know, either going unaddressed or <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5448.968s">are</a>  overwhelming code enforcement or, you know, a lot of them are getting reported by residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5454.274s">So</a>  if there isn't a resident in a place who knows how to report something, or doesn't have access to the systems or is new to the area, maybe that thing just never even gets to the people who can enforce it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5464.574s">And</a>  there's also the specific issues that I've definitely had communications from and have annual communications from folks in the Hillside neighborhood as it relates to Tufts University students and landlords. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5477.082s">So</a>  that's the intent of this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5479.924s">Happy</a>  to move through it and have the discussion that folks are here to have on Councilor Caraviello's resolution.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5486.028s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5490.513s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Bailão, for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5491.935s">Again,</a>  for the last 12 years, I've been on code enforcement consistently. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5497.281s">It's</a>  nothing I have ever waived on. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5501.145s">In</a>  the past two mayors, three mayors, I've always wanted more code enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5508.147s">Sorry,</a>  I went up to the Board of Health the other day with a rat situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5513.13s">I</a>  was told that the inspector for rats was on vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5515.571s">I'll</a>  have to wait until she comes back. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5518.693s">We</a>  only have one person doing rats. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5520.033s">And</a>  again, it's a systemic thing throughout the whole city. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5524.496s">I</a>  thank you for bringing it forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5526.116s">And</a>  it's something that needs to be really taken care of quickly.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5532.236s">I</a>  want to thank Vice President Meares for introducing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5534.899s">I</a>  think tonight it really exemplifies why we need to invest more in our code enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5541.165s">We</a>  need our laws to have some meaning. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5546.932s">This</a>  is also something I should note that the first budget I worked on here, the one <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5553.459s">I</a>  guess, in 2022, 2022, we, as a council and our Committee of the Whole sat down and advocated for more money put to code enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5562.567s">That's</a>  something that we coordinated our efforts on. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5564.749s">I</a>  think it's, it would be, that's something that I know Councilor Caraviello and me were particularly passionate about in that meeting, in that Committee of the Whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5574.677s">in</a>  the upcoming budget season, no matter whatever the format or the makeup of the city council may look like after elections, I would really hope that the city council redoubles on its efforts to push for more code enforcement.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5591.405s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5593.345s">So</a>  on the motion by Susan Bair, seconded by Councilor Knight, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5604.011s">7</a>  in the affirmative, 0 in the negative, the motion passes, 23-405 offered by Councilor Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5619.045s">Be</a>  it so resolved that city administration provide a written explanation as to why the city attorney defaulted on a court appearance related to 41 Emory Street proceedings. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5626.707s">Be</a>  it further resolved the city administration provide the city council with all correspondences, communications, records, reports, and any materials related to the distressed property located at 41 Emory Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5637.309s">Be</a>  it further resolved that the disability director have the owner remove the overgrowth as the sidewalk is impassable to wheelchairs, strollers, and pedestrians. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5645.211s">access</a>  in the interest of public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5647.691s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5648.232s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5648.892s">Madam</a>  President, the person who lives next door reached out to us, reached out to the whole council to go by and look at the house and what was going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5659.073s">So</a>  I had the opportunity to go over there last Thursday and meet with her. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5662.954s">She</a>  gave me a little walk through the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5665.534s">And</a>  I was appalled to hear that our city of Medford took the homeowner of 41 Emery Street to court <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5675.296s">and</a>  we did not show up in court. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5678.699s">Okay,</a>  we're paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to a law firm who couldn't even send the first year law student, a law associate to go to court and show up for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5691.09s">Shame,</a>  shame, shame, shame. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5693.532s">Nevermind</a>  the overgrowth at this person's house. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5697.036s">This</a>  house has been abandoned for a while, they know who the owner is. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5700.423s">I</a>  know there was some work done on the property over the last weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5705.025s">It's</a>  still not acceptable to the owner. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5707.385s">There's</a>  overgrowth all over the place. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5709.626s">It's</a>  not fair, again, similar to this gentleman's, but not fair to the people who live in that community that's been taken over by students for years, and it's not a new problem that this house is gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5724.211s">left</a>  like that in this condition where you can't even walk down the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5728.473s">Never</a>  mind if someone had a stroller or someone had a wheelchair, impossible to get by there. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5733.695s">But</a>  again, shame on us for defaulting a court because they said they didn't have an attorney available. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5739.878s">KP</a>  Law's got to have 50 lawyers in their office there. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5744.06s">Totally</a>  unacceptable, Madam President.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5747.181s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5749.011s">Um,</a>  I concur with Councilor Caraviello that that was perhaps the most shocking part of that email. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5756.36s">I</a>  mean, why would we go schedule a court date without talking to Kate, without making sure that someone from KP Law would be there and without making sure that someone from our city would be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5767.293s">It</a>  just doesn't make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5769.274s">You</a>  know, this is something that would be inexplicable if you went to a law firm and asked them, you know, how are you scheduling your court hearings? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5780.68s">So</a>  I support this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5782.241s">I</a>  think we need answers because this is unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5785.403s">And,</a>  you know, are there more cases of this, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5788.605s">And</a>  that's why I would want to amend, if you're so amenable, Councilor Caraviello-Velo, to ask also for a written explanation as to how we're going to prevent things like this from happening again. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5799.693s">So</a>  a written explanation as to how the city of Medford will prevent defaults on court appearances from happening again.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5813.243s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5814.204s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5815.685s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5819.209s">I</a>  don't want to say it, but I'm going to say it, but I told you so. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5824.552s">We</a>  had an opportunity this budget season to hold the mayor's feet to the fire, and we didn't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5830.615s">The</a>  answer to Councilor Tseng's resolution is very simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5833.637s">It's</a>  called a city solicitor, an assistant city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5839.12s">It's</a>  unheard of in the state of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5842.438s">the</a>  city of this size, not having a team of city solicitors representing the residents, the council, of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5856.207s">So</a>  we're finally getting some redacted bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5860.21s">I</a>  believe it was last month, maybe you can correct me, I believe it was over $100,000 K.P. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5866.074s">Law.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5866.995s">I</a>  believe this month, last month that we just got, a slow month, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5871.877s">I</a>  believe it was another $60,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5872.778s">Correct</a>  me if I'm wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5876.479s">But</a>  this is money we're paying to a law firm that doesn't have to answer to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5885.084s">And</a>  this is what's frustrating. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5886.265s">These</a>  are basic necessities we need that every city needs to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5895.049s">Even</a>  tonight, some of the resolutions we're going through, we're talking about <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5898.786s">I'm</a>  afraid to open my mouth because we have no legal representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5903.028s">Because</a>  one one of our residents came up and said, Well, you're starting to pick on people. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5908.611s">I</a>  don't disagree with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5910.452s">And</a>  the fact that we don't have legal guidance to say careful how you say this, because you could be sued, because that's happened to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5919.737s">Did</a>  we not forget that? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5922.218s">And</a>  we're still in court with it with the BJ situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5926.521s">So</a>  again, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5930.998s">Thank</a>  you for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5932.319s">Again,</a>  for the neighbors, what's going on in that neighborhood is ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5937.802s">I</a>  think that, again, the fact that we don't have code enforcement officers is another big issue, but we wouldn't know that because we couldn't discuss these issues at the budget hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5955.732s">Because</a>  the mayor got what she needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5958.193s">She</a>  got her four votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5961.212s">And</a>  now here we are again, bringing up these same things and sounding like a broken record. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5966.453s">Well,</a>  I will tell you, I, on the school committee, we realized we had the toughest mayor that negotiates in years, and Mike McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5978.597s">And</a>  when we needed things done for our school department, the school committee stood together and would not vote a budget until we got what we needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5990.137s">And</a>  I know people don't like to hear this, but that's politics. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5994.718s">That's</a>  part of the whole gamut of why we're here. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6000.66s">This</a>  mayor is doing whatever she wants to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6004.761s">And</a>  I don't see any benefit for our community, whether it's neighbors with Airbnbs, or whether it's a simple question that people, no one's picking up the phone. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6017.133s">So</a>  I'm frustrated, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6019.373s">I'm</a>  not as animated, because I think I'm getting tired of being so animated. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6023.654s">But</a>  again, this is a very simple issue, very simple solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6028.955s">Hire</a>  a city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6032.716s">Hire</a>  an assistant city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6038.217s">In</a>  most communities, that's like saying, breathe. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6044.318s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6045.718s">Thank</a>  you, Pastor Garbelli.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6047.182s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6048.723s">As</a>  Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, so we're just on two months, we're at $160,000 for two months. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6057.009s">So</a>  the comment was made, well, we're not paying enough money. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6060.772s">We're</a>  spending probably $800,000 to $900,000 a year on legal fees. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6067.824s">We</a>  can hire a Supreme Court justice for half a million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6070.867s">So</a>  don't tell me that there's no money to hire a solicitor or an assistant solicitor because we're spending way over budget on outside legal fees that could be done in-house.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6086.983s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6091.356s">I</a>  appreciate you bringing this up and I think that this, these two, this resolution and vice president beers is for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6098.705s">They</a>  rhyme together because when you look at the experience of this particular household on Emory Street and I had the opportunity to speak with one of the neighbors there as well as with representatives from our Board of Health Department and <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6109.457s">There</a>  were a lot of details from this particular episode, which would not shock most people in the city who live with, you know, chronic code violations, you know, as a matter of course, but are still shocking to hear, you know, the way in which this particular, you know, quote unquote resolution was trying to be achieved to a truly unsatisfactory way, how much time it took. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6132.401s">But</a>  we're talking about the need to reallocate <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6137.515s">or</a>  find new resources to make sure that we're spending money where it's going to be meaningful for our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6141.82s">Because</a>  currently, you know, I spoke to the Board of Health and they said, I think it was about a different household with a vermin problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6148.769s">They</a>  said, you know, same thing that you heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6150.791s">The</a>  one inspector that we have for that in this apartment is out on vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6154.756s">And</a>  when she gets back, she will start to work through <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6157.279s">the</a>  queue that has been amassing for her ever since she took her vacation, which I'm sure was extremely deserved because she's the only person doing this type of inspection in the entire city. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6166.385s">No</a>  person is a superhero. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6167.766s">This</a>  is an extremely severe misallocation of resources problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6172.228s">And</a>  the downstream effect is that residents feel the lack of responsibility and the lack of communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6177.852s">And</a>  they see their complaints going under investigated and unresolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6181.614s">And</a>  that's not because our city staff are doing a bad job. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6184.696s">It's</a>  because there just aren't enough of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6187.421s">And</a>  I know that we all feel that frustration day in and day out when we get these emails and calls, and we know that we feel it every meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6194.046s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6210.398s">Madam</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6216.471s">I</a>  am at a loss sitting here hearing that after the amount of money that we spent on outside council, that represents the mayor personally and not the city of Medford, an amount of money is some of the totals close to a half a million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6243.175s">over</a>  $450,000 we spent on KP Law's legal fees in what appears to be violation of city ordinance, Madam Mayor, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6254.545s">Once</a>  again, I'm calling you Madam Mayor, because I'm just wishing it would be somebody else, but the one that's in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6260.03s">When</a>  I think about this, Madam President, it makes me crazy, because for three years, I feel like I was talking in an echo chamber. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6269.767s">saying</a>  we need to hire a city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6271.429s">We</a>  need a city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6272.49s">We</a>  need to hire a city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6273.791s">We</a>  still don't have a city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6275.353s">Instead,</a>  we have a private law firm that we paid a half a million dollars to. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6280.097s">It's</a>  too busy to go to court and represent the interests of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6285.363s">That</a>  shows you where their priorities lay. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6289.807s">It</a>  also shows you how inept this administration is. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6294.645s">when</a>  it comes to the deliverance of basic city services, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6298.108s">And</a>  number two, the protection of the taxpayers' interests when it comes to having in-house legal counsel that represents the taxpayer and not the corner office. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6307.697s">So</a>  here we are again, two months after the budget passed, asking for more money for a code enforcement office. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6313.643s">So</a>  when we had an opportunity, when we had an opportunity to hold up a budget and get what we needed, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6319.788s">Number</a>  two, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6320.891s">And</a>  we're coming off the heels of a budget where the mayor said she was gonna hire a solicitor and an assistant city solicitor for the council and never did. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6327.655s">Unfulfilled</a>  promises, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6333.739s">Unfulfilled</a>  promises. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6337.301s">This</a>  has been the number one issue, the number one underlying theme throughout this past term for this council is where is our legal representation? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6347.727s">We're</a>  driving a ship without a compass. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6350.615s">We're</a>  going into uncharted territory, and we need guidance. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6353.938s">Please</a>  help us. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6356.079s">Please</a>  help us. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6358.141s">That's</a>  the council asking, and the council gets ignored. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6363.685s">Now,</a>  Madam President, we have residents asking. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6367.047s">They're</a>  saying, please help us. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6368.549s">Please</a>  help us. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6369.409s">And</a>  they're now being ignored. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6370.95s">And</a>  KP law is defaulting on court appearances that they filed, that they filed. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6380.046s">KP</a>  law is directing the board of health not to put clean it and lean it notices on homes after the council is directing them to do so because such levels of dissatisfaction in the public administration of the enforcement of code. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6400.422s">So</a>  again, we can put the record on repeat. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6402.904s">Madam</a>  president, here we are again, the same spot we were 12 months ago, the same ones we were the same spot we were 12 months before that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6410.552s">I</a>  sit here and I scratch my head every day and I say, let's name one thing the city does well. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6420.26s">Let's</a>  name one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6423.462s">Our</a>  school test scores are down about eight, 9% across the board in the last three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6430.067s">Our</a>  city streets look awful. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6432.209s">Our</a>  sidewalks look terrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6434.411s">We</a>  can't get trees trimmed. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6436.012s">We</a>  can't get stumps removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6437.822s">We</a>  can't get crosswalks repainted. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6439.744s">We</a>  can't get 3-3 paved. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6443.326s">The</a>  only saving grace we have in this community is we pick up that phone and dial 9-1-1. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6446.969s">And</a>  we know that the police and the fire are always going to show up with or without a contract for 700 plus days. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6457.677s">So</a>  when I sit here and I reflect on what's going on in this community and I ask myself, what are we doing well? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6463.922s">What</a>  are we doing well? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6465.343s">That's</a>  one of the hottest questions I have to struggle with every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6468.598s">Because</a>  when I look around, I don't see anything that we're doing well, that we're exceeding at, that we're excelling at. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6472.641s">I</a>  don't see anything that's putting Medford on the forefront, that's keeping Medford where it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6482.469s">10</a>  years ago when I got elected, Medford was the hottest zip code in Massachusetts because of its large inventory of single family homes and its small class sizes. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6492.516s">Boy,</a>  how times have changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6494.218s">Boy,</a>  how times have changed, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6498.766s">We're</a>  a community that's losing its identity. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6503.069s">And</a>  pretty soon we're going to be swallowed up and become just a pocket of Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6508.733s">The</a>  zoning reform that's coming up is going to be very important to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6512.355s">And</a>  I hope the mayor keeps her word this time around and provides us with the tools necessary to succeed. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6518.34s">Because</a>  right now, I feel as though the city is not in a strong position for now or for the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6523.063s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6525.925s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6528.951s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6534.754s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6536.315s">And</a>  you can hit that button if it's, there you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6539.597s">Oops,</a>  sorry, maybe they, there you go.</p>

    <p>[Narelle Marr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6542.699s">Hi,</a>  Narelle Marr, 39 Emory Street.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6545.16s">Michael</a>  Marr, 39 Emory.</p>

    <p>[Narelle Marr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6548.282s">I</a>  wanted to address the issue at 39 Emory Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6553.164s">It's,</a>  there's, you guys all got my email. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6556.426s">There's</a>  a lot going on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6558.186s">but</a>  it's not a new issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6559.627s">It's</a>  been going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6560.388s">I</a>  just looked through my records. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6563.811s">2011</a>  is the first time I emailed the city council about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6568.074s">And</a>  it's just, there is no enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6572.878s">There</a>  hasn't been any enforcement and people get up in arms and talk about enforcement, but it just doesn't get done. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6581.085s">So</a>  I heard <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6582.213s">the</a>  enforcement issue come up many times today. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6586.576s">And</a>  I also heard the rat issue come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6590.84s">Those</a>  are two really important issues that need to be funded.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6599.186s">Yeah,</a>  I mean, it's 20 years ago.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6600.967s">Just</a>  lean towards the mic.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6603.309s">Yeah,</a>  City Solicitor 20 years ago, we had Mayor McGlynn and we're living in the exact same neighborhood today that we had 20 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6609.974s">We've</a>  been fighting this fight <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6611.721s">We</a>  have landlords, absentee landlords that come in, buy a property, walk away and rent overcrowd, do not take care of anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6619.668s">And</a>  the more that this happens, the more of the good people like Rich and Tracy, Rhonda Randy, ourselves, we're gonna move out. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6628.375s">I</a>  could make a fortune on my house renting to students, but we don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6632.838s">So</a>  we're here again, just asking for the help of the city to step up for the good people, because if you don't, you're gonna get more of the difficult people. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6641.064s">So</a>  really could use your help.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6644.527s">Thank</a>  you for the discussion from the council versus affairs.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6652.874s">Yeah,</a>  I mean, I just want to say to the points that you made, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6659.124s">You've</a>  been fighting the same fight for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6662.406s">You</a>  haven't seen the enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6663.807s">It's</a>  because the enforcement hasn't been funded the whole time. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6667.889s">And</a>  that's fundamentally the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6670.231s">This</a>  council doesn't have the ability to increase funding for anything by a single dollar. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6674.173s">All</a>  we can do once a year is cut. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6676.855s">We</a>  can take more away. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6678.676s">That's</a>  the only power the city charter gives us. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6681.257s">And</a>  I know I've communicated with all of you here about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6688.629s">I'm</a>  glad you're voicing the issue again. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6690.653s">I'm</a>  glad we're setting resolutions up. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6692.598s">I'm</a>  sure we'll get responses eventually. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6694.382s">It's</a>  an incredibly difficult position to sit here and say, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6700.646s">here</a>  you say can you help us and me basically have to think, and I'm just going to voice it now and say, functionally no. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6707.211s">Right,</a>  you've come up and you've asked the Council for 10 years for help, and it's the same charter and different members of the Council completely right, you could say people love the Council 10 years ago and they hate me and you know whatever completely different Council, same issues, and quite frankly it's going to be the same response because this Council whether it's <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6724.295s">the</a>  people here now or the people here 12 years ago, neither of those councils could raise any funding for any department by a single dollar. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6731.138s">That</a>  power only lies with the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6732.739s">And</a>  I'm sorry that we can't do more for you to help you other than try to be advocates from the position that we're in.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6741.683s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6747.566s">I</a>  have a question regarding enforcement.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6750.287s">Does</a>  an enforcement create revenue? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6752.748s">If</a>  you start going after, as soon as you started enforcing some of the fines on some of these landlords, things changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6759.23s">So</a>  the money would come in if you enforce it like a revolving door there. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6762.991s">You</a>  lay out the fines on parking, lay out the fines on absentee landlords and money comes in and helps pay for the enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6769.152s">Work</a>  with Tufts, maybe Tufts can help up because they are providing the students or good kids, but for the most part, they're creating havoc in our neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6776.134s">So</a>  maybe Tufts can help out for our particular part of the neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6779.707s">It's</a>  a revolving thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6780.508s">I</a>  would assume so. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6781.509s">Maybe</a>  it's not, but that's what I was hoping.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6783.27s">You</a>  know, I don't know if other Councilors have haven't answered the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6789.036s">My</a>  understanding is that other than the parking <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6792.349s">parking</a>  and permitting. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6793.33s">I</a>  haven't seen civil code enforcement violations as a major source of revenue for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6797.654s">I</a>  don't know if that's because it actually costs more to send people out to enforce it than we're allowed to fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6802.759s">I</a>  think we're limited at our maximum to $300 per issuance on the fine by state law, 350 maybe. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6810.026s">So</a>  I don't know the answer to your question is all I'm saying.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6814.414s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6815.315s">Councilor</a>  say Councilor bears is understanding is my understanding as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6820.258s">Given</a>  our limits on how much we can charge violations and fine for violations and given the, I mean, it could be that we're just we haven't done it so we don't know but <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6831.424s">realistically,</a>  given the number of possible violations out there, probably would not amount to a full-time salary for the position. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6837.649s">But</a>  that doesn't mean that we shouldn't be investing in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6839.91s">I</a>  mean, we should be doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6841.572s">And</a>  so I would definitely say in the next budget process, no matter who's mayor, who's not sitting on this side of the rail, that we come up to residents, like you come up to the city council and advocate for more funding for code enforcement and more hiring, more staff in that aspect. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6859.554s">To</a>  the rodent point, we passed a resolution two weeks ago from Councilor Scarpelli, asking us to sit down with the Mayor, with the Director of Public Health of the Board of Health on the rat issue to talk about solutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6876.921s">I've</a>  mentioned in email to you folks about some of the things that the resolutions that we've passed on our end. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6883.263s">as</a>  another enforcement issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6885.924s">We</a>  have strengthened our ordinances with regards to that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6889.505s">I'm</a>  trying to think of what else. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6891.646s">Oh,</a>  we need to be working with Tufts, as you guys have said. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6898.288s">I'm</a>  sure the students are well-intentioned, but there's a lot that they don't know with regards to some of the kind of <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6905.771s">quality</a>  of life issues that they're causing in the neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6908.353s">And</a>  so I think we need better communication with cops, better, more pressure on cops to, to have them communicate better, to have them enforce better. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6916.438s">Um,</a>  we need to relook at our community benefits, um, with them as well, relook at the pilots because they don't pay property taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6924.303s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6924.784s">Um,</a>  but we, we need to leverage that to, to have better pilot agreements with them as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6930.227s">And</a>  I think the enforcement aspect could be something that we talked about.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6937.516s">Madam</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6939.217s">Actually</a>  Tufts through their development has agreed with the city to pay taxes, property taxes, I believe in all the new purchases of land and I've done so for over a decade now. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6950.881s">But</a>  I think Madam President that the most moving thing that was said tonight was take care of the good people because if you don't, you're going to lose them. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6958.704s">And</a>  you're just going to get more of the bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6963.254s">I</a>  really think that was the most moving thing that was said this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6966.057s">Take</a>  care of the good people. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6967.079s">Give</a>  the good people some help. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6968.749s">because</a>  that's all they're asking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6970.99s">So</a>  I appreciate the gentleman. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6972.291s">That's</a>  something that really resonated with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6974.572s">I</a>  think that, you know, we all know what we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6977.113s">We</a>  need to get action on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6978.534s">We</a>  need to hold the administration accountable for their failures and delivering the basic public services that these people deserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6984.457s">And</a>  I can't understand why we don't have a program or a maintenance plan or a review plan where we go out to these distressed properties, which we know we've had problems with. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6994.088s">year</a>  after year and do a spot check once every 6, 8 or 12 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6999.154s">I</a>  mean, it's basic, basic, basic stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7001.697s">The</a>  person that's answering the phone knows the phone's gonna, knows they're gonna get the phone call and when they see who it is that's calling them, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7007.594s">know</a>  exactly what it's about. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7008.615s">It's</a>  gotten to that point with people in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7011.817s">So</a>  I don't understand why we can't take a couple of steps and be a little bit more proactive and have an outreach program where, you know, when we know we have these distressed properties and these properties that are failing to do right by the neighborhood, that we don't go out there and do a little bit of outreach and preventative maintenance, as they like to say, to prevent this from happening and rising to this level of frustration.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7033.666s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7035.007s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7037.328s">And</a>  I think it's time to maybe make a motion that we become a little creative. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7042.071s">I</a>  know that working with the building department, the inspectional service department, maybe working with the unions, maybe we ask the city administration and the mayor to sit down with those unions like they do with the police department and bring in retired police officers and maybe pay them to actively <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7063.624s">to</a>  go out and do, you know, assist with the code enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7069.468s">And,</a>  you know, especially with our retired police officers, I think that might be an opportunity that we can think outside the box. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7077.955s">And,</a>  you know, other communities use grant writers, bringing in grant writers and use grants that they would write to bring in money to our community and pay them through that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7089.483s">Maybe</a>  there's an avenue there that they, you know, having some incentive that <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7093.266s">we</a>  can, you know, do a few things at once where we're sending more people out, qualified people out, to understand our code enforcement and start, like our neighbor said, is start policing it better and giving them the avenues that we haven't given them at budget time. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7118.356s">I'd</a>  like to make that form of motion that we ask the mayor administration to look into that process to try to immediately enhance the code enforcement office, both with the health department and the building department.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7134.043s">Please.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7137.224s">Going</a>  to Mr. Castagnetti on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7150.422s">Mr.</a>  Castagnetti.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7162.11s">We</a>  can hear you.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7163.551s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7165.032s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7166.453s">With</a>  all due respect to our city council at night, I disagree because this city does one thing really, really well. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7179.989s">and</a>  that is collecting our real estate taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7185.352s">Also,</a>  is it time to adopt Mass General Law, Chapter 59, Section 5C? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7191.856s">So</a>  the owner-occupied exemption will go to the homeowners who live in their home, and our savings will be shifted to those absentee landowners, house owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7204.282s">On</a>  my street alone is three, Winchester, Andover, and Wellesley. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7210.342s">Maybe</a>  it's time. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7211.223s">Thank</a>  you for listening.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7216.567s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Melanie Tringali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7217.988s">Hi,</a>  I'm Melanie Tringali. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7219.108s">I</a>  live at 116 Forestry. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7221.73s">I</a>  just had a couple of questions and then maybe a couple of suggestions. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7226.714s">Councilor</a>  Bears stated that the revenue from the parking is the only revenue that <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7234.574s">fees</a>  that has the most, but I have not been able to see or find in the budget the actual amount of money that we get from parking fees. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7243.266s">I've</a>  seen the cost it is to support our parking department, which is four people, and I've seen the revenue generated from our excise taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7252.312s">but</a>  I've not seen any breakout of revenue from our parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7256.074s">So</a>  that's a question, I don't even know if we're making any money off of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7259.735s">That</a>  was delivered to the council.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7260.976s">I</a>  have the budget, I couldn't find it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7263.277s">Yeah,</a>  it wasn't in the budget.</p>

    <p>[Melanie Tringali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7264.458s">Oh,</a>  okay.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7264.918s">And</a>  I think it was referenced during a meeting, so we can get that to you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7268.379s">We</a>  have a lot of issues with how the budget is formatted by the mayor.</p>

    <p>[Melanie Tringali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7270.981s">Yeah,</a>  that's true. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7274.562s">The</a>  other thing I was going to mention was it's building off of, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7279.703s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli is pilot programs, working with Tufts and our other nonprofits and helping with a lot of the code enforcement and getting some restitution or help in that situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7292.252s">And</a>  then also, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7294.164s">my</a>  understanding, and I could be wrong with how I read the budget, but isn't there $25 million put aside with the fact that the mayor only wanted 10% of our full budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7304.466s">So</a>  if I read that budget correctly, that means she wanted to put about 14 million aside for a rainy fund, but that's still money that's left over, no?</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7313.708s">We</a>  can't access it right now, because we can't access it again until it's free cash and certified, which is not until next year, end of this year? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7321.87s">At</a>  least it would work. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7323.75s">Okay,</a>  so yeah, maybe it's yeah, October, November. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7326.052s">So</a>  yes, but we can't access that money currently, currently.</p>

    <p>[Melanie Tringali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7329.995s">But</a>  you said October, November, November. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7332.517s">So</a>  that's not that far away.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7334.038s">We</a>  still get access. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7336.12s">Only</a>  the mayor can ask it to be spent, right?</p>

    <p>[Melanie Tringali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7338.582s">So</a>  you guys don't have authority to ask to be sent, but you can recommend to the mayor that she make adjustments in the budget to enforce codes. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7347.168s">in</a>  ordinances, is that correct?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7349.45s">We</a>  nominally have yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7352.953s">That</a>  sounds beautiful. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7354.794s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7356.075s">We've</a>  made a lot of recommendations.</p>

    <p>[Melanie Tringali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7360.158s">I</a>  know. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7360.559s">So</a>  then in other words, then the citizens really need to get on her in residence of Medford to ask her to really push for this, but all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7368.225s">Thank</a>  you for answering my questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7369.286s">I</a>  appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7370.006s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7372.027s">even</a>  if we use free cash reserves, which are basically just the reserves of the city for one time enforcement, they're one time funds, so wouldn't be hiring a permanent code enforcement officer if we use those reserves. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7384.795s">So</a>  it really is this longer term, bigger question of, are we funding enforcement in the city correctly? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7392.78s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello's sixth term and every term, I think his answer has been, no, we're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7398.123s">And</a>  he constantly is recommending every budget <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7401.095s">under</a>  three mayors, if I'm correct, to change that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7406.078s">Fundamentally,</a>  and Councilor I talked about earlier, I think we've all talked about it earlier, whether it's reallocating funding, reorganizing divisions, organizing a more proactive enforcement to bring in enough revenue to support the department or using funds, finding new revenue sources to fund it, whatever option we pick on any of those things, that is the administration of the city and that's under the executive <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7431.087s">branch.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7431.707s">And</a>  we are the legislative branch. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7433.768s">And</a>  under our current charter, we don't have the authority to order, you know, maybe maybe we could pass an ordinance to say we reorganizing inspectional services, but I'm not necessarily even sure that the mayor has to follow that, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7445.391s">Like,</a>  as we've noted tonight, we have an ordinance saying we will have a city solicitor, we haven't had a city solicitor for what 30 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7451.833s">So</a>  it's <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7456.178s">Yeah,</a>  it's just an incredibly frustrating situation to sit here and be trying to voice and engage and and work with residents to come up with to voice have hear residents voice in their concerns and difficulties and wanting to see the city become a better place. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7469.648s">In</a>  addition to, I agree that we do collect the property tax I would say the other thing that we as a city to effectively is this city council for the two terms that I've been on it has passed a lot of good ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7481.696s">We've</a>  done a lot of good legislating we passed the road and control ordinance we passed the zoning ordinance on short term rental, we've tried to pass things giving code enforcement clear authority we've passed are working closely to pass a new waste ordinance right. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7494.341s">And</a>  we passed all these ordinances, and the staffing isn't there or the, you know, for whatever reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7501.264s">the</a>  administration doesn't enforce those ordinances to the letter, and that is where the difficulty comes in, is we can pass the strongest and as many ordinances as we want, but if they don't get enforced by the mayor and her team, or the mayor doesn't come to us and say, I need more resources to enforce this ordinance, then we end up where we are, which is passing good ordinances that then don't get the follow-through that they need. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7527.699s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7531.9s">I</a>  want to commend my council colleague for suggesting that we move to supplement our code enforcement staff with the use of, whether it be retired police officers, was it, Councilor? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7546.945s">Or</a>  code enforcement?</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7549.226s">Right,</a>  I think anybody that can be trained for that, Councilor Knight, that works with the union and the code enforcement department right now that can do something that <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7560.458s">can</a>  assist with these concerns and issues so we get ahead of it.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7565.482s">Yeah,</a>  I mean, I think that's a great idea, especially when you look at how human resources in this community is handled. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7572.547s">I</a>  mean, how many times have we had per diem department heads? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7575.95s">We've</a>  had a per diem assessor, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7578.292s">We've</a>  had a per diem building commissioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7580.313s">We</a>  had a per diem veteran services director. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7583.676s">Why</a>  can't we do that with code? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7586.638s">That</a>  sounds like a great idea to me.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7594.565s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7597.126s">I</a>  appreciate this discussion and I always find it, I'm always gratified we have the opportunity to make it clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7604.428s">I</a>  think for the benefit of residents and knowing how to navigate our government, what specifically the powers of this council are and on what matters, we have to be advocates. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7616.071s">And</a>  sometimes being the role of an advocate can be very gratifying. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7618.572s">I</a>  mean, we've talked a lot about different ways of addressing this enforcement problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7624.093s">Throughout</a>  this meeting we've talked about you know the resolutions that are out because we've talked about we've tried to do in budget seasons, we've talked about convening a meeting with the building department and code enforcement and dpw and the mayor's office to talk about how can we address this from multiple angles we've talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7640.026s">better</a>  allocating revenue to better fund these specific departments that we know need to be at least doubled, it seems like, if not more so. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7648.331s">I</a>  also really appreciate bringing up pilot, you know, pilot agreements. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7652.894s">I,</a>  you know, as a Tufts alum myself, I feel like it needs to be, I try to say as often as possible, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7659.978s">This</a>  is specifically an area because the neighborhoods that that affects that Tufts puts a lot of I would call, you know, abstract or immaterial things into its pilot agreement with the city, and we have existing material needs that are going on that that are exacerbated by the presence of the university for all the good that it does. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7676.182s">This</a>  is another issue where I think it's one where this council, what if it could would make direct appropriations more directly. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7683.084s">help</a>  with these problems, and in a lot of cases we can't do those things, you know, just like making resolutions to advocate in the budget for allocations that should be made to put more resources into code enforcement and whatever else we need to start meeting residents' needs, you know, I would love to see us build up a process like that with PILOT as well, so that it's more related to the actual needs going unmet in this community, and not <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7710.945s">these,</a>  you know, less than immediately relevant community functions. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7716.908s">When,</a>  you know, I mean, we've been talking about code enforcement for feels like five hours, you know, it can go on all week just talking about code enforcement with the issues that get brought up to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7728.854s">So</a>  I, I appreciate all the energy around coming to this issue from a lot of different angles, I think that we need to advocate for all of it, you know, the stuff that we can do directly legislatively, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7740.964s">we'll</a>  continue to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7742.285s">We'll</a>  continue to advocate around the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7743.726s">I</a>  think that we should redouble our efforts to, you know, for this council to advocate around pilot as we do around the budget as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7749.309s">But</a>  I appreciate everybody who's weighed in on this.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7752.691s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7754.332s">I'll</a>  finish up with this, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7755.512s">You</a>  know, we've all sat around and touted all the ordinance that we passed in order to be good. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7761.996s">But</a>  at the conclusion is, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7766.684s">Are</a>  any of those ordinances that we passed enforceable? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7770.246s">Because</a>  by our city charter, we're supposed to have a city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7774.309s">And</a>  if you recall, we sent something to the state attorney general's office for an opinion, and the opinion came back was what? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7781.654s">Ask</a>  your city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7784.276s">If</a>  you recall that we did that not too long ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7786.637s">Again,</a>  so, and that's a really a grave concern that, Isaiah, we talked about all the great work we've done, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7794.505s">Is</a>  all that great work that we've done, is it really enforceable? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7800.45s">So</a>  just something for thought.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7803.032s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7804.193s">Vice</a>  President Bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7805.614s">I'll</a>  just be fast. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7806.594s">We've</a>  been here so long and talked so long that I'm sure some folks have had to use the bathrooms at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7812.259s">And</a>  I think that the bathrooms at City Hall are actually one of the best examples of how deeply underfunded the entire city is. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7819.584s">I</a>  don't think they've been updated since the building was built in 1937. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7823.51s">You</a>  know, it is not it is it is not a good experience for a resident to use the bathroom and city hall for any staff to use it, and I just bring it up because <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7833.351s">On</a>  every single issue, all of the capital infrastructure that the city owns and manages, we have one of the worst water and sewer systems in the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7842.333s">We</a>  have roads and sidewalks that are in a state of disrepair, trees, you know, we have public buildings like this building that are needing massive renovation, and that's just the capital side. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7853.135s">You</a>  come to the operating side, and it's a massive underfunding of code enforcement, health sanitarians, rodent control and animal control, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7863.493s">people</a>  to look at the ADA issues around the city, teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7868.934s">basically</a>  everything that the city is doing, with the exception of a couple of things that have been highly prioritized, like public safety and emergency response, have been massively gutted over the last 40 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7881.94s">And,</a>  you know, if the plan is, hopefully there'll be enough, you know, we're gonna pass the zoning and new projects are coming in and that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7889.523s">If</a>  the plan from the administration is fingers crossed in five to 10 years, the council zoning will bring in enough commercial development that maybe we'll start being able to fund things again. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7898.447s">It's</a>  just not acceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7900.188s">So,</a>  you know, we talked about being a broken record we've I think brought up all the great broken record subjects tonight of all of our different priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7908.996s">I'll</a>  bring up mine, which is the city needs more money to do its job the city does not have enough money to effectively staff, basic operations or maintain basic capital infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7919.464s">And</a>  I don't think that new growth and waiting to do that is the plan, but I also agree with my fellow Councilors that in addition to that understanding, and those are just the numbers of the budget if you look at over the last 40 years, we're in an even worse position, because we're not <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7935.058s">even</a>  using what we have to the best of its effectiveness. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7938.16s">So</a>  it is a double-edged sword. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7940.521s">It</a>  is both not having enough resources to do everything we need to do and not prioritizing the limited resources we have to be used to their most effective. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7949.965s">And</a>  I think that basically rules the day on almost every topic that comes before this council at every meeting that we have.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7957.769s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7958.929s">So</a>  we do have a B paper from Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7960.79s">Do</a>  you have the language for that B paper, Mr. Clerk?</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7968.288s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli's B paper was to ask the administration to sit down with the unions and bring retired people in to assist city staff with code enforcement efforts.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7981.712s">If</a>  we could amend that too, Councilor Knight brought up a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7985.793s">Per</a>  diem payments <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7990.956s">to</a>  assist.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7991.216s">Is</a>  that amendment for you or from Councilor Knight?</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7993.278s">No,</a>  if you can add that to that amendment to that B paper that add that or either word it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8003.124s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8003.484s">Mr.</a>  Clerk.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8004.005s">So</a>  in other words, pay those former employees with per diem payments.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8007.527s">As</a>  she's been doing, as the mayor has been doing multiple times in multiple positions in City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8012.59s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8210.553s">Madam</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8211.754s">I</a>  bring this resolution forward requesting that we have a little bit more accountability and some tracking and measurement of data when it comes to the use of take-home vehicles here in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8220.258s">Now,</a>  there are certain positions in the community that one would expect as a take-home vehicle, the chief of police, the chief of fire, the DPW commissioner, but there are other positions in this community where people are allowed to take-home vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8232.123s">So</a>  the question therein remains, how much use and wear and tear is being put on these vehicles that's being utilized for purposes <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8241.357s">work.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8242.517s">Ultimately,</a>  this council has appropriated hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions of dollars for the replacement of equipment and part of our fleet. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8250.6s">And</a>  as we go through the process of replacing vehicles that are becoming, I guess we'd say, less equipped to deal with the wear and tear of our everyday <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8261.76s">work</a>  that we perform here in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8264.883s">It's</a>  interesting to see where these new vehicles are going and what their uses are for. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8269.046s">Ultimately,</a>  you know, I think that there are some protections that we need to put in place to prevent the city from getting into circumstances where we might be liable for things that we didn't anticipate we were going to become liable for. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8280.193s">Now,</a>  whether or not these trucks are provided by contract or by grant, the department head or the mayor, they do have implications. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8288.036s">For</a>  example, Madam President, if someone were provided a take-home vehicle and they were injured in the line of work, the cost of that take-home vehicle goes towards their wage. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8297.139s">So</a>  when they're out of work collecting compensation, they'd be compensated based upon the wage that they earn plus the value of the vehicle. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8305.073s">So</a>  that greatly increases the city's liability when it comes down to certain issues of employees that are into the line of work, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8311.299s">Number</a>  two, take-home vehicles also increase the city's liability if there were an accident to occur outside of working hours, outside of city limits. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8321.387s">There's</a>  also a question about how much of the city's resources in the form of gasoline <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8328.392s">and</a>  other maintenance and upkeep necessities are being placed on these vehicles through the commute to and from work and they're not used inside the city limits or for city purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8339.276s">So</a>  the intention of the ordinance, Madam President, is to put some restrictions upon this and put some data reporting requirements on this so the city knows where their fleet is, what their fleet is doing, when they're doing it outside of city limits and outside of city operating hours and how much <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8353.92s">wear</a>  and tear is being put on these vehicles that's being done not in the performance of the city duties but in the performance of traveling to and from work commuting and other items for life. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8362.988s">I</a>  mean ultimately a take-home vehicle would be only utilized for the purpose of going to your house and from your house and when you get home you're going to get into your own private vehicle so tracking this mileage is very important I think for us in this community to be sure that our fleets are being maintained in the proper and most satisfaction in the court. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8378.742s">also</a>  take on vehicles to present tax implications, if I'm not mistaken, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8384.287s">So</a>  these are things that we need to take a look at and be sure that we're complying with all standards of our federal state statute as well going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8391.113s">So</a>  that's why I raised the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8392.114s">It's</a>  something that seemed important to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8393.896s">It</a>  doesn't seem too important to many of you, but I certainly think that asking that a city <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8401.411s">vehicle</a>  isn't something that's too much to ask, and that we track where these vehicles are going when they're outside of city limits, outside of working hours isn't too much to ask, and that we track the mileage on these vehicles when they're outside of city limits, outside of working hours isn't too much to ask, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8415.297s">So</a>  that's the basis of the ordinance, and I ask for my council colleagues to support sending this to subcommittees so that we can have a further discussion with our future legal counsel.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8422.36s">Thank</a>  you for that synopsis, Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8426.716s">I'd</a>  like to propose a B paper to ask the clerk to compare the length of the captions to the length of the ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8436.442s">But</a>  I would also, that's a joke. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8438.063s">I'll</a>  move to refer to, do you have a preference of subcommittee, Councilor Knight?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8443.284s">It's</a>  up to you guys, really. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8445.305s">It's</a>  an ordinance, so it probably should be fitting to go to that subcommittee, but if it wants to go to public safety, or if it wants to go to, I do believe there was a request prior to put together a subcommittee on legal services and litigation that we're still waiting to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8458.288s">It</a>  could go there once that gets created, but whatever it is that you see fit, council, if it has any divine wisdom, I'd be happy to support.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8466.33s">Motion</a>  to refer to subcommittee on ordinances and rules.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8535.301s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8537.241s">I'll</a>  be as brief as I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8538.442s">The</a>  Tufts RAs went on a one-day strike last week, and I was happy to support them and this council also. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8545.62s">asked</a>  Tufts to recognize their union and instead Tufts forced an election, which lengthened the process by months. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8550.882s">And</a>  now we have the contract process lengthened by months. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8553.943s">So</a>  these folks don't have a fair contract when the new school year started. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8557.184s">But</a>  the bigger and more important point I wanna make about this is I spent four years working to bring together students and workers and community members and communities to hold universities accountable to treating everybody fairly. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8571.89s">And</a>  really the most important thing about that is <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8575.011s">whether</a>  it's RAs or students on campus or residents in the neighborhood around Tufts who are not getting fair and equitable treatment by Tufts or Tufts is taking actions that negatively impact the community or the folks on campus, we're all in the same fight. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8594.056s">Tufts</a>  is a billion dollar institution, multi-billion dollar institution run by a small group of people who make decisions that a lot of people disagree with. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8603.027s">And</a>  we can all fight our fights with Tufts separately if we want, but we're actually stronger together. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8608.71s">So</a>  one of the reasons I think it's important for community members and the city council to support the Tufts RAs is because if we build that relationship, we can call on the Tufts RAs to support us in asking for and fighting for a bigger pilot. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8621.055s">And</a>  there was an interview today, the Tufts Daily interviewed the new president of Tufts, and <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8628.178s">the</a>  student reporters were making that point too. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8631.661s">They</a>  said, well, what about the impact that Tufts has on the surrounding community? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8634.804s">And</a>  the president says, oh, we, you know, new president says that we try really hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8638.106s">And</a>  to give him fair credit, he seemed to be taking a better tone on it than I've heard in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8642.67s">But</a>  he said, you know, we wanted to hear about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8644.772s">We</a>  want to try really hard to support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8647.054s">And</a>  the student pushed back. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8648.715s">So</a>  we have the narrative that we've been talking about by reaching out to Tufts students, reaching out and working with the workers on campus about the impact of Tufts on the communities and the neighborhoods that it lives in. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8661.14s">That</a>  message is breaking through. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8662.761s">And</a>  if we can all work together to hold Tufts accountable to do better, we have a much better shot than we do of doing it alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8668.343s">So</a>  that is the larger message and point of why it's important to build relationships and show solidarity like this, because what goes around comes around. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8677.167s">They're</a>  mistreating the RAs today. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8678.746s">that</a>  we mistreat in the neighborhood tomorrow and someone else the next day, and it's better off if we work together to fight that than if we do it alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8686.251s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8686.791s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8687.211s">Councilor</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8689.273s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell, and thank you, Vice President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8691.414s">I</a>  think that was very eloquently put. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8695.437s">As</a>  I like to remind people, I'm a Tufts alumni, so this is my atonement. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8701.921s">Just</a>  kidding. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8704.643s">But</a>  as an alumna, I do feel a particular responsibility to <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8709.79s">speak</a>  up in this case for the Tufts resident assistants who are seeking simply just to collectively bargain and a fair contract with their employer. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8719.714s">I</a>  also want to remind people that we're talking about an institution with a $2.4 billion endowment. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8725.556s">This</a>  is the same institution with a $2.4 billion endowment that doesn't pay taxes to us and does not volunteer to help us fill the gaping holes in our various municipal civil service needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8739.581s">Particular</a>  to the Tufts RAs fight, you know, I think that, you know, labor is labor and workers are workers and it's time to stop entertaining the narrative that seeking to collectively bargain is anything other than reasonable. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8752.223s">I</a>  wish that Tufts would more enthusiastically respond with that attitude. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8756.724s">All</a>  experts, I mean, all workers are the experts on their work and RAs are the experts on their role in the campus community, which of course affects the Medford community in myriad ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8768.226s">They</a>  stabilize and counsel and provide logistical support for the dorms. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8771.708s">And</a>  I think it's also true that the dorms that they serve have become more complicated and more needful in the past few years because of the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8780.554s">So</a>  I'm thankful to my fellow Councilors and community members for coming together to say, you know, Tufts has to quickly proceed towards a compromise solution and a fair contract because anything other than that would be <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8795.202s">Candidly,</a>  a truly bizarre waste of their administrative time and resources, of which we know they have many. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8800.626s">And</a>  we know that there's so many more important needs that those could be put to, not just making the campus experience more livable for those living and working on campus, but for the community as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8815.058s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8820.231s">I'll</a>  be very brief because I think Councilor Bears and Councilor Collins have covered a lot of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8826.414s">We,</a>  I think tonight have talked about the need to cooperate more with each other and with Tufts to make sure that Medford is more livable and that we are tackling a lot of the broader challenges that our neighbors in the Tufts neighborhood see. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8843.641s">I</a>  think Councilor Bears makes a great point that <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8846.522s">we</a>  need to work with students to bring about that change, because a lot of what we're fighting for is aligned with what they're fighting for as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8854.548s">When</a>  I go to Tufts, and I have more connections there in the way that a lot of them are my classmates or classmates from high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8863.776s">There</a>  are a lot of folks there who've been asking me how they can contribute to <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8869.642s">to</a>  Medford and how their school contributes to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8873.167s">And</a>  oftentimes, I have to give the hard answer, which is that, you know, to be fair, Tufts isn't doing enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8880.058s">And</a>  we can be getting the university and students to be doing more for our community as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8886.166s">Tufts</a>  does, you know, that's not to say that Tufts does nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8888.627s">Tufts</a>  does do things, but it doesn't match up with the shortfall that we get with in terms of them not paying property taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8897.812s">And</a>  so we need to build those connections to bring them to the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8902.354s">Ultimately</a>  Tufts workers, be it students or faculty or researchers, they're Medford workers as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8908.797s">And</a>  we need to make sure that Medford workers are working to the best standards possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8914.921s">When</a>  you look at what ultras put out what the union is put out in terms of what they're asking for it's really not a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8921.829s">Back</a>  in college I did, I did similar work to being an RA without the residency part, and I got paid more than what you know I got more benefits than what they <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8930.499s">they're</a>  getting right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8931.419s">And</a>  they're doing more work than I was ever doing in college in that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8935.54s">And</a>  so I think when you ask, oh, and you look at what they're asking for, it's really not a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8940.861s">And</a>  it's a really, it's really a minimal action for us to pass this resolution tonight and to stand with them.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8950.663s">President,</a>  I appreciate bringing this forward as a strong union supporter. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8956.424s">I</a>  support anything dealing with unions, but I, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8962.489s">I</a>  would be remiss if I didn't bring up the fact that we're talking about, we're talking about RAs from Tufts University. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8969.614s">And</a>  if I recall back, we talked about our own unions being affected. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8975.86s">and</a>  Councilors that are sitting here talking about the effect that it had, you know, on the process of moving forward on a nonunion contract is because maybe we need to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8988.265s">We</a>  need to help things going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8990.966s">Remember</a>  those conversations? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8992.686s">We</a>  have a fire department that hasn't had a contract in almost 800 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8997.508s">We</a>  have secretaries that didn't have <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9000.009s">a</a>  contract for six years. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9001.45s">We're</a>  talking about the RAs at Tufts University, a contact at Tufts University today. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9006.613s">And</a>  boy, I tell you what, correct me if I'm wrong, free room and board, free meals plan, stipend. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9016.198s">So</a>  when I talked today with the representative of Tufts University, that's what they told me. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9020.74s">Not</a>  to say, I'm just sharing to you what they've told me. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9024.162s">I'm</a>  just, and you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9026.043s">So</a>  what I'm saying is this, understanding that, I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna vote for this because I think any union, any person that wants to work together as a union and have representation, you can never deny it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9042.05s">But</a>  I just want you to realize and understand <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9044.953s">And</a>  it's a good point to bring it forward that we have unions right now in our own backyard. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9049.316s">My</a>  father always told me, don't worry about your neighbor's backyard till you clean your own backyard. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9054.678s">800</a>  days, 800 days without a contract for a firemen and women. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9059.781s">They</a>  sat through the pandemic, the first ones they applauded how great they were, how amazing what they've done for our community, going into the homes where people are dying and putting their lives first. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9072.861s">So</a>  I'm using this, yes, I'm using it as a platform that I hope you understand why. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9077.505s">It's</a>  for the fact that we have unions in our own community right now in Medford, hardworking men and women residents that live here all year round that haven't been treated fairly. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9091.488s">Again,</a>  two wrongs don't make a right, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9093.648s">So</a>  I'm going to support this paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9095.089s">I</a>  think it's a very important paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9097.289s">And</a>  that's why I share what the representative from Tufts University told me today, so we can all understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9104.251s">This</a>  is the difficult part about negotiations. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9106.611s">You</a>  hear what you want to hear, what they want to say, to make it sound good. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9110.952s">But</a>  who's affected? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9111.992s">And</a>  that's the employee, the worker. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9114.313s">And</a>  again, I think we need to look at our firefighters, because I think, listen, unified message next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9121.986s">What</a>  can this mayor do to support our firefighters? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9126.707s">Update</a>  us right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9128.868s">I</a>  know that the negotiations now are now in arbitration, it's out of our hands, but what else can we do for our firefighters that we're showing them the unity, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9140.29s">That</a>  they're standing together and saying, what are you gonna do for them? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9145.772s">But</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9146.352s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9151.481s">Madam</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9153.183s">I</a>  think Councilor Scarpelli is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9155.885s">Things</a>  at Tufts University aren't very different than things at City Hall when it comes to labor relations. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9164.551s">The</a>  only difference is our friends at Tufts University have the power to strike. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9170.936s">And</a>  that's what they did. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9171.716s">And</a>  I commend them for taking the steps that they see necessary to ensure that they secure a fair collective bargaining agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9178.425s">I</a>  support their right to organize. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9180.286s">I</a>  support any group's right to organize. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9186.288s">I</a>  do feel as though Tufts University this evening has been given a very bad rap. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9194.51s">And</a>  I, in no uncertain terms, agree with the way that Tufts University is handling this issue with their RAs. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9206.716s">Nor</a>  do I agree with their position on the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9209.718s">However,</a>  they've been taking a pretty good beating this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9214.18s">And</a>  I think it's important that we point out there are many benefits that do come with being host to a university. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9223.906s">One</a>  is prestigious as such university. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9228.308s">We</a>  keep talking about the fact that they don't pay taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9231.85s">That's</a>  patently false. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9234.472s">They</a>  don't pay taxes on a portion of their property. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9237.631s">And</a>  they've entered into an agreement voluntarily. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9242.254s">But</a>  they've said that they will continue to pay property taxes on newly purchased properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9247.257s">And</a>  this has been going on for quite some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9251.18s">So</a>  Tufts University is not the villain that we make them out to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9254.782s">Do</a>  problems come along with having Tufts University in our community? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9259.265s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9260.826s">Every</a>  problem in every community stems from something. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9265.148s">Tufts</a>  is not a villain. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9266.647s">when</a>  we look at the benefits that they bring to our community, like diversity, like economic stability during unstable and poor economic times, or like the community of academics that tend to call Medford their home after being employed at one of the most prestigious universities in the United States of America. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9292.987s">So,</a>  Madam President, I can understand that being a good neighbor is one thing, but I think that they've always been a good partner, they've always lent a listening ear, and they've always invested in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9305.019s">Whether</a>  or not you feel as though they're giving enough is one thing, but they always have been some of us willing to come to the table and sit down with us, and I think that that's important to point out. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9314.969s">I</a>  just wish that Clemson University took that same approach with their RAs and was willing to sit down with them at the table and put this issue behind them and reach a fair collective bargaining agreement for all involved so that we can move on because ultimately the ones that get affected the most are the students and the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9330.157s">So</a>  with that being said, Madam President, these parents are making a $70,000 investment <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9335.488s">for</a>  the kids to worry about whether or not their IRAs are gonna have a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9340.07s">So</a>  we need Tufts to get back to the table and negotiate this, because these Tufts students are residents of Metro, and the IRAs are residents of Metro, and they deserve our support. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9349.433s">I</a>  support the people of Iowa. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9350.853s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9353.534s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9355.335s">Councilor</a>  Bears?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9357.736s">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9358.216s">Yeah,</a>  yeah, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9359.456s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9360.397s">Just</a>  three things. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9361.657s">One,</a>  on Tufts, it's not about villain or hero. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9365.78s">their</a>  budgets $1.2 billion a year the city's budgets 200 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9369.785s">They</a>  have 2.4 billion in endowment we have 25 million in reserves, they're rich we're not, it's a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9375.351s">I'll</a>  leave it there. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9378.554s">The</a>  second thing I'll say just on the union workers, I hear you, I understand the issues with the contracts that workers have here. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9385.307s">I</a>  know it's not a position that everyone back here wants to say, because it's technically a position of saying that there's an unjust law that public sector workers can't strike. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9393.732s">I</a>  support state-level legislation to let them strike. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9396.314s">And</a>  I said to workers that came up here, if you took a strike action, I would walk on the picket line with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9401.537s">I</a>  don't care if it's illegal or not illegal by state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9405.199s">It's</a>  a bad law. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9406.18s">And</a>  it means that bargaining goes on forever for 700, 800, 900 days with no timeline on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9411.123s">And</a>  the workers have no leverage, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9413.084s">The</a>  point of the union is that you have collective power and part of collective power is taking a job action. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9418.246s">I</a>  guarantee you if the firefighters in the community, which is an even bigger thing to go public safety, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9424.069s">The</a>  firefighters in the community went on strike for 12 hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9427.13s">Everyone</a>  in the city would lose their minds and they'd have a contract the next day. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9430.031s">I'm</a>  not saying that's the best policy in the world, but at the very least state law needs to change so that they don't sit for 700 days before a contract goes to arbitration. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9438.094s">So</a>  I just wanted to put that point out there that <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9442.267s">You</a>  know, we support the workers to, there's a lot that needs to change around public sector bargaining.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9448.068s">On</a>  that point, Madam President, I can't go back to you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9452.689s">It's</a>  in the direct rebuttal to the statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9458.39s">I</a>  just know I just don't want I don't want you to think that I'm saying the firefighters should go on strike or that I support that or that number or number two. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9465.862s">that</a>  the firefighters would even consider that because I think we've heard time and time again the firefighters come up here and say all we want to do is keep Medford safe and we're going to continue to come to work no matter what and we're going to fight to do that and we're going to fight for fair wages in the meantime and if it takes 800 to 900 days we're not going to lie down but we're going to still continue to come to work today and I don't so I don't I don't think the firefighters would support the statement of saying we're going to go on strike. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9488.809s">And</a>  I don't want anybody to think that that's what I was intending to say, or intended to say that they should do, because I don't speak for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9495.715s">So</a>  I just don't want to be misconstrued or misinterpreted in saying that I think the firefighters should go on strike, or that I think the firefighters would go on strike if they have the power, because I can't speak for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9504.403s">But</a>  from what I've heard and from my conversations with them, these men and women will come to work every day to make sure this community is safe, and they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9512.129s">and</a>  they will continue to do so, and I don't see them ever, ever, ever taking a position where they take a strike action against the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9518.151s">They'll</a>  continue to fight for fair wages in the proper format, but I don't ever see them doing something illegal in order to jeopardize the safety of the residents in this community, nor would I condone it, nor do I think they would. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9529.834s">So</a>  thank you, Madam President, for allowing me the opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9532.235s">I</a>  just wanted to be very clear in my words, and I didn't want to get them misconstrued, because sometimes that happens over social media. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9539.84s">virtual</a>  Zoom stuff, not social media. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9542.543s">I</a>  apologize.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9544.105s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9544.986s">Councilor</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9546.128s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9548.09s">Very</a>  briefly, and I think that if I might speculate, I think that the point here is not that there's a strategy that should be taken, but just that clearly the process <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9556.88s">is</a>  broken and that's why we see these labor disputes, these labor struggles in our own community. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9562.085s">And</a>  I think that we all want to see the overarching process change so that workers in our community, whether they're workers in our community that work for City Hall or workers in our community that happen to live on Tufts for now, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9573.715s">that</a>  they can collectively bargain in a way that they can efficiently proceed to a just outcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9579.399s">And</a>  I'm really heartened, and I think that this resolution and previous ones that the city council has worked on are evidence of this, that everybody behind this rail takes the opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9589.147s">And</a>  everybody in this community, I think for the most part, takes the opportunity to stand with labor when they can on the actions that they feel that they can take. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9595.391s">And</a>  behind this rail, I think it's our right to sometimes have different ideas of what is possible for us to do and what's strategic. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9601.676s">That's</a>  our right. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9602.617s">We</a>  have a diversity of opinions, but I think when push comes to shove, we are all doing our best to stand with the laborers and the workers in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9610.004s">With</a>  that, I would move for approval.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9612.566s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9613.007s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Collins, Councilor Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9617.965s">I</a>  apologize for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9618.806s">I</a>  was acting as a non-union plumber in the other room, but someone from the water department is coming down to save thousands of gallons of water that is just going up the- Bathroom's not working?</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9629.476s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9629.756s">Yeah,</a>  it's been running thousands. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9631.558s">So</a>  someone's coming down. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9633.259s">I</a>  apologize for missing, but I know discussions about union workers, but cost of living is going up at a ridiculous pace right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9644.201s">All</a>  workers deserve fair raises and not waiting for years to get them. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9648.143s">So,</a>  I support this resolution.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9650.024s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Karygiannis. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9650.885s">So,</a>  on the motion of Councilor Collins, it's seconded by Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9657.468s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9844.602s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9845.242s">Um,</a>  this is something that some residents in neighborhoods around the square wrote to me because when you walk towards metric square over the bridge, you can see trash by the river and there are some residents who have been collecting the trash on the weekends. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9858.533s">It'd</a>  be. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9859.733s">I</a>  so I, I'm going to request that we make one small amendments. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9866.695s">So</a>  basically, after where it says, ask the administration to, instead of saying to place, I would move to amend it to say, ask the administration to study placing more waste disposals. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9884.67s">This</a>  is just an idea that, you know, once we're trying to get people to use the Clippership connector to walk more to the square to bike more, people are going to be passing by that area more. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9895.239s">And</a>  with people comes litter. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9898.602s">And</a>  so I would like us to kind of tackle this problem somehow. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9906.044s">Someone</a>  did write in with a concern that trash waste disposals, trash bins might create problems of legal dumping. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9914.666s">And</a>  that's why I made that amendment to change the language a little bit to soften it and to ask perhaps someone like PDS to, an office like PDS to study what the pros and cons are and how we can reduce litter over there.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9931.735s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Saint. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9932.375s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9933.116s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9933.856s">If</a>  Councilor Saint wouldn't mind amending that, not just on the Clippership Connective, but throughout the whole city. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9939.48s">I</a>  mean, we used to have those big belly things there, they used to be, but they're all pretty much broken or gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9946.605s">And</a>  you can see where they used to be, there's nothing in some of those spots. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9950.088s">So</a>  if we can amend it to put more trash throughout those, especially in the business districts where they're firing fuel.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9957.713s">Yeah,</a>  it'd be super amenable to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9961.004s">Yeah,</a>  I think you make a great point that there used to be big belly trash cans. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9966.006s">We</a>  are disposals. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9967.507s">We</a>  can do things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9969.208s">We</a>  can tackle the rodent problem in the squares as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9973.109s">If</a>  we have better disposals, we can put solar powered things on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9976.771s">We</a>  can put advertisements on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9977.931s">It's</a>  a way to generate revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9979.132s">There's</a>  just so many things that we could potentially do with it if it makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9983.053s">So</a>  yeah, I'd be amenable to that.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9984.714s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9985.194s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9985.955s">I</a>  know exactly what happened to you happened to me where it seemed <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9989.423s">seems</a>  like it's something so simple as put more trash barrels out and then rebuttal is always that people will just use that as their own personal trash cans with legal dumping. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9996.146s">So</a>  I think studying is how we start people with more insight on this than us, I appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=10001.608s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Tseng as amended by Councilor Tseng and Councilor Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Collins, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.</p>
